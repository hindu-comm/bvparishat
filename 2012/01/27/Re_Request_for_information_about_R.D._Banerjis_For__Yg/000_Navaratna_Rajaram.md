*January 27, 2012*



 I have request for the scholars, especially for Dr Bhagwan Singh. Is R.D. Banerji's *Mohenjo-Daro: A forgotten report* still in print? I know that a reprint was issued in 1984 from Varanasi.



 Rakhal Das Banerji was the true discoverer of Mohenjo-Daro but John Marshall stole both his discovery and his report and appropriated the credit in his articles in the *Illustrated London News.*



**Also, my late colleague Natwar Jha told me something interesting-- that Marshall saw that Harappan archaeology was full of Vedic symbolism and the writing had similarities to Brahmi, but Marshall deliberately suppressed it. One can speculate that he did to preserve the Aryan Myth, which was by then the official British ideology-- that Indians andBritish were fellow Aryans long separated but "brought together by Providence" in the words the British PM Stanley Baldwin.



 Everyone talks about the Nazis using the Aryan myth but scholars are reticent about the British version. Even Thomas Trautmann in his two books totally ignores it, indulging in various diversions to preserve Harappan-Vedic separation and the late chronology of the Vedas. This is so even in his latest book (2011) ***India: Brief history of a civilization.***

****

****** It is full of red herrings avoiding recent findings. I want to counter it by exposing Trautmann's dishonesty.



 Any help in this direction would be appreciated.
