Dear Murthy,  
Happy New Year!  
If the problem is with MS-Word documents, it may be because the files are saved as .docx files, the default file extension from Word 2007 onwards. If the files are saved in 97-2003 compatible .doc format, they will be opened in all versions of Word/Office. But docx files will not be opened by versions earlier to Word 2007. So your problem may not be with Win 7. But on the other hand if you can open the file but not able to read the fonts, then those fonts may be missing from your machine. But unicode fonts will be opened everywhere.  
If you can provide the details of any file which you have been unable to open, I will try to do something about it.  
Another suggestion is --if you are speaking about attached files--use google doc viewer to open the file online. It opens both docx and doc files. You have to use gmail for that and instead of downloading the file, view the file.  
  
Good wishes  
  
Dr. I. Srinivasa Rao
