Respected scholars,

The Unicode characters of the Devanagari posted in mail of the google group will appear in Windows XP too. The question is whether you can create those Unicode characters in built in structure with the help of the software that you have. I post mails to our BVP group in Devanagari with Fedora in Linux. A few people do it with Windows 7 and the others send in Devanagari from their mobile phones too. So we have to update our using system with new compatible ones. Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows 2000 and XP etc. are to be replaced with Windows 7 and Fedora, Ubuntu etc. As thus it has been said:

वासांसि जीर्णानि यथा विहाय नवानि गृह्णाति नरोऽपराणि। तथा शरीराणि विहाय जीर्णान्यन्यानि संयाति नवानि देही।।

If 10% of the members are unable to read the above said Devanagari portion it is the problem with the machine that they are using. To the best of my very limited experience, I would say, once an inbuilt Unicode character is typed out it appears, and it should be, as it is in most of the machines. Otherwise, 70% of conversation in Devanagari characters would not have happened, in our BVP.  

Regards,

Narayanan
