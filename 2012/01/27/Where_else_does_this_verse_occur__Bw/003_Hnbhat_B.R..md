I think both are correct according to the flexible omission of "visarga" according to the Varttika, "खर्परे शरि विसर्गलोपो वा वक्तव्यः"

as there is nothing to indicate it should be in पदान्त though the examples are given रामः स्थाता - राम स्थाता। Here there is no need of spacing, as the "sandhi" occurs within the "samAsa". This is just suggestion. Or it may be simply an omission by the scribe as it is usually not heard in the compound.

  

Hope this will explain the similar forms.
