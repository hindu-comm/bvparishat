> How about these words:  
>   
> 1.मनःषष्ठानीन्द्रियाणि  
> 2. निःश्वसितम् (opp. of उत् + श्वासः = उच्छ्वासः)

>   
> निः + चलम् = निश्चलम्  

> 3\. निःशुल्कम्  
> 4. अन्तःशान्तो बहिःशान्तो..  
> अधःस्थितः  
>   

  

The last comes within the scope of the same rule quoted for antastham and can be written as अधस्थितः also.

  

Others have specific changes to the विसर्ग according to the following following word and the विसर्ग is optional even in Sandhi in case of 1, 2, and 3 and 4. which would take the alternative forms: as मनष्षष्ठानीन्द्रियाणि, निश्श्वसितम्,निश्शुल्कम्andअन्तश्शान्तो बहिश्शान्तो.. etc. due to the operation of rules effecting श्चुत्व, ष्टुत्व as the case may be. But in the case of निश्चलम् there is no optional possibility of विसर्ग also and only श्चुत्व is obligatory.

  

The relevant rules are स्तोः श्चुना श्चुः and  ष्टुना ष्टुः. The other alternative forms with विसर्ग are "वा शरि" which makes these operations optional in respect of विसर्ग before श, ष and स.
