Namaste to all scholars  
V Subrahmanian ji thank you for rising this question.  
i also very curious on this and i got these type of reference while i was going through with the book "VISHNU SAHASRANAMA WITH THE BHASHYA OF SRI SHANKARA" trasnslated into English in light of Sri Samkara's bhashya By R.Anantakrishna Shastri(Adyar Library-1980) says that(in page no 60)-  
" \* itah param daakshinaatya pustakeshu adhonirdishyamaano adhikapaatho drashyate-  
rishirnaamnaam...............etc  
(the verse भूः पादौ यस्य ...follows.....)  
the book says that it is available in only daakshinaatya text...
