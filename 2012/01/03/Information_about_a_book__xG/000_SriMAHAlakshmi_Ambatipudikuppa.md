Dear scholars

  

I came across a very old book at a friend's place. A quick preview of the book shows it is in an ancient version of Marathi and the book is named "Hari Vijayam". In the last page of the book, the author states in Phalasruti that the book was written in 1198 (Keelakanama samvatsare Vasanta rutau Phalguna maase Sukla pakshe Sridhara Brahmananda Virachitam)

  

I am looking for further information about this book. Has any one heard about it or know any one who might know about this book? If so, please pass on the information.

  

Thank you. Appreciate your help.

SriMahaLakshmi
