Dr Tripathiji and Sanskrit Scholars,

By God,s Grace, I had the opportunity to attend the recent **World Sanskrit Conference**. Though late, it is my earnest duty to express **Hearty Congratulationsand my sincere gratitude**to Shri Radhavallabh Tripathiji and his dedicated team for organising this delightful Conference !!

It was indeed a Divine experience for me similar to listening to a long session of selected Vedic Chants or so. Sincere Thanks to the Organisers and all authors!!.
