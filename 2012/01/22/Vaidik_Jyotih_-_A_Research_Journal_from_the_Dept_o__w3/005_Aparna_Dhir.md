Respected Scholars & Researchers,

  

  

The Dept of Veda, GKU, Haridwar invites scholars to share their views and valuable information ofVedas by contributing their research papers for the journal ‘**Vaidika Jyotih**’. The aim is :-



· To explore the relation between the Vedas and the Sciences by providing significant evidences on various aspects of scientific knowledge.



· To clear the unpleasant remarks made on Vedas.



· To discuss Swami Dayanand Saraswati’s teachings in context of Vedic literature.



· To publish a part of any rare or out of print Vedic work.





For fulfilling the above motto, the committee has decided to publish this journal twice a year. Before getting published, the contributions made to this journal will be reviewed by the committee members. The contributors are free to share their ideas in Sanskrit, English, or Hindi languages. The very first issue of ‘**Vaidika Jyotih**’ will get released in Feb, 2012.
