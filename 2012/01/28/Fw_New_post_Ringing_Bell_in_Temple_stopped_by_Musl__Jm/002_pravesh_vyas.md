\> \> \*A\*nti-Hindu Congress Government in Andhra Pradesh has banned ringing of  

\> \> bell in Sri Bhagyalakshmi Temple in Char Minar area in Bhagyanagar. The  
\> \> Government has also imposed ban on performing ‘Maha-aarti’ and has deployed  

\> \> police force to implement the ban. \*Akbaruddin Owaisi a Member of  
\> \> Legislative Assembly (MLA ) of ‘MIM (Majalis Ittehadul Muslimin)’\*, a  

\> \> Muslim Political Party being the alliance with State Congress Party of  
\> \> Andhra Pradesh, a southern state in India, has demanded to impose ban on  
\> \> processions taken out on Hindu festivals viz. ‘Ram-Navami’ and  
\> \> ‘Hanuman-Jayanti’. Hindu organizations are angered due to such demand by  
\> \> Owaisi. In a country where Hindus are in majority, a Muslim MLA, demanding  
\> \> ban on processions taken out during Hindu festivals, indicates that Hindus  
\> \> are staying in Pakistan and not in India. Muslims are now demanding ban on  
\> \> Hindu processions; tomorrow, they will demand for demolition of Hindu  
\> \> temples and will, later, demand that Hindus should become either Muslims or  
\> \> leave their womenfolk behind.  

\> \> \*U\*nfortunately, Muslims are considered as a very lucrative vote

\> \> \*A\*ctually, lack of unity among Hindus is responsible for such situation  
\> \> and there is no alternative for Hindus to establish a \*Hindu Nation in  
\> \> Bharat\* to change this situation. \*It is now established that Congress  

\> \> Govt. is trampling sentiments of Hindus only to appease Muslims. Today,

\> \> Hindu-hater rulers of Congress will issue a ‘fatwa’ that Hindus should  
\> \> adopt Islam; cows will be slaughtered in front of Hindu temples; Hindu  
\> \> women folk will be enjoyed by them by their choice; Hindus will be  
\> \> considered as 'Jimmi' or otherwise to be slit on neck as being Kaffir and  
\> \> a Muslimstan will be established in India as Pakistan. How long are Hindus
