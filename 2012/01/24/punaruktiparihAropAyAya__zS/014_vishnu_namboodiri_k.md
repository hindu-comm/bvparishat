The Anvaya is --"vedasuryah sameshaam andham bhramathathithamah  
chichcheda".Here the simili is between thamas(darkness) and  
bhramathathi(bunch of ilutions).And that darkness is not little,but it  
is very much thick, as it can make one blind.Andham means  
"blindening".A bunch of ilutions is such a Blindening darkness.  
Respected Mr.S.R.Krishnamurthi,The word is not bhramad+athithamah.It  
is "Bhrama+thathi" I could see no punarukthi or no difficulty to  
understand the intended meaning.  
When you make a statemant like-"By tearing the beutiful shloka into

  
grammatical fragments, the splendid bhaavaartha and its beauty is  
totally lost; the unity of expression is lost. Grammer is only a tool,  

not the target.",you become so peripheral.For me,Vyakaranam is not at  
all uttering or quoting some sutras.But it is the right way or method  
of understanding a language.Even without the knowledge of sutras or  
such statements one can be said to be knowing vyakaranam.The knowing  
language is not seperate from knowing vyakarana.Thus the commentary  
given by Sri S.R.K.Murthy is undoubtedfully wrong as far as sanskrit  
language is concerned.
