Blindening.I used the word Blindening, not blinding.In a thick  
darkness one becomes blind.Such darkness is blindening.Before the  
rising of the veda surya, there is the darkness of "Bhrama-thathi" ie  
"bunch of ilution".And the sun rises, the darkness automatically  
withdraws.OK.I dont know whether the sloka is arthavada or  
somethingelse.
