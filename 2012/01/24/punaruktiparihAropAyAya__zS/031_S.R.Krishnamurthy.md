Thanks to all the scholars who threw sufficient light on the subject. What I have quoted on the word Kavi is not mine; but quotations from the Upanishats and Shankarabhashya; with ref. to the context and not to undermine any poets. My apologies if my arguments have hurt anybody; which is far from my objective.
