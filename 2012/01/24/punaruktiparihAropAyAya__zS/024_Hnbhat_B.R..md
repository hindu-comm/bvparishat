Sri Lalithalalitha has already given the Vakyarthanvaya according to Vedanta concept.

  

Dear Sir,

  

What do you mean by Vakyarthanvaya? Vakyartha derives from the context and not of what you have conceived to be the Vakya.

  

  

I am not a grammarian nor a scientist, but an ordinary reader of Sanskrit and I do not find any of the faults pointed out as Vakyarthadosha enumerated by the rhetoricians. Please elucidiate your idea of Vaklyarthanvaya-dosha?

  

For the punarukti, the solution was already in the first post itself, the confusion was raised only by misunderstanding the meaning of the word "andha" which is nanartha as the quotation from Amara itself suggests:

  

"अन्धं तमस्यपि" itself suggests (the word andha is used in the meaning darkness also in addition to other meanings popular. You can see the other meanings for the "andha" from my post as per Medini. So restricting to one meaning at our will doesn't make any solution to the problem, but only one has to chose the normal language habits without twisting it for etymology to squeeze the meaning desired by us. Though we could not survey the whole of Sanskrit literature for the meaning, certainly the lexicographer had access to the vast literature available at their time (which is still less remaining up to our time), we can safely rely on them for the speech habits as recorded by them.



If you don't like the use of metaphor वेदसूर्यः in the poetic composition which appreciable to all and instructive of the theme behind it, please explain the Vakyarthanvaya fault shortly as we could understand. I am not able to follow your scientific Vakyartha.

  

With regards
