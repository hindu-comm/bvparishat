Mr. Namboodiri, thank you for enlighterning me about one more possiboe resoliution of the compound BramatitamaH. But one fundamental question remains, in the absence of the context - that is, how could there be 'blinding' darkness, when vedasurya was there. So the answer is still incomplete. A statement should be complete in itself. But here; what or who caused the blinding 'bramathathitamaH', so that the vedasurya could destroy? How do you classify the shloka; as arthavada, anuvaada or vyarthavada?
