My dear Subrahmanyam,



You do not seem to have read my posting completely; else a scholar like you would not have jumped to conclude as you have.I did not mean by अन्वयthe prosaic order, but application. How do you accomodate ati in your andham tamaH?what do you annote bybhramat? anvaya is application, not mere order. Please give the complete solution.

yours fraternally,

s.r.krishna murthy
