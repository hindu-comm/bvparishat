I could not find the word bhramaa

in the feminine in any dictionary except at the end of a compound (ifc). ref. Monier Williams.

  

Here the word is not at the end of the sentence and could not however be in the feminine in the sense of illusion or hallucination or moving object. and am not aware of any other invented meaning by "kavi"s.

No more discussion on this point when Kalidasa is not accepted as a कवि or even the आदिकवि. This kind of argument had been answered by Anandavardhana:

  

शब्दार्थशासनज्ञानमात्रेणैव न वेद्यते ।

वेद्यते स तु काव्यार्थतत्त्वज्ञैरेव केवलम् । । ७ ।



So I don't want to extend the discussion.

Originally there was no punarukti, but only confusion because of the attempt to restrict the meaning of the word to a single one that didn't suit at all, like your attempt to limit the scope of the word "kavi" only to show your skill of शब्दार्थशासनज्ञान.

In the original word tbey were not separated at all, unless one like you wants to split it by providing space in between. VS has already explained as it is understood by all other than yourself.

Now also VS has maintained the same position.

There is no word "ati" at all in the compound, but only bhrama-tati-tamaH. I could not follow your argument. If you want भमत् + अतितमः - there is not a superlative degree "tamap" suffix as you imagined out of nothing. Even though if it is accepted, in "sandhi" it would be भ्रमदतितमः and not भ्रमततितमः according to my limited knowledge of Sanskrit grammar. Now your question itself is redundant.

No more argument as there was not at all redundancy in the meaning originally as explained by many.

I can't follow you here. See my reply in the first section. Even if accepted, "bhramaa" as adjective, to "tati", it can get shortened and as far as you can quote rules that do not get shortened, I can't see any that bars this adjective getting quoted. If it is not adjective, there is no question of shortening at all.

  

After all what I requested was the inconsistency you found in the sentence except that you don't like poetic imagination or metaphoric expression even going to the extent of limiting the scope of the word कवि and काव्य to only Vedic sentences and Vedic seers. All other objections you had raised were redundant by themselves.

  

गणानां त्वा गणपतिं हवामहे कविं कवीनामुपमश्रवस्तमम्।

ज्येष्ठराजं ब्रह्मणां ब्रह्मणस्पतिंआ नः षृण्वन्नूतिभिः सीद सादनम्॥

  

In each context the word can have different meaning and not only limited to one meaning.

  

स पर्यगाच्छुक्रमकायमव्रणमस्रविरं शुद्धमपापविद्धिम्।

कविर्मनीषीपरिभूः स्वयंभूर्याथातथ्यतोऽर्थान्व्यदधाच्छाश्वतीभ्यः समाभ्यः।।8।।

  

Just the verse quoted before the one already quoted for अन्धं तमः प्रविशन्ति - used as adjective of तमः।

  

and many more in many contexts with different meanings.
