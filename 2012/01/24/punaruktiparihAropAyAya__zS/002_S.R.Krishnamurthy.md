I consider **भ्रमततितमो as an adjective qualifying वेदसूर्यः, when the problem does not arise. Atitamas is also the attribute of Parameshwara, before he became manifest. Ishwara, Bhramat, stirring up in the form of VedaSurya (radiating knowledge {in the form of light} through Vedas) destroyed the darkness of ignorance.**
