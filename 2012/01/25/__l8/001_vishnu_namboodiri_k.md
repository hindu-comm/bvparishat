\> By the word Yogah, we mean suthram.Sometimes in special surcumstances it is needed to seperate one sutram into two to get additional wanted result which otherwise cannot be got.This kind of interpretation of panini's sutram is known as yogavibhagah.For example, "ach prati-anu-ava-poorvath samalomnah".This is separated into "ach" and "prati-anu-ava-poorvath samalomnah".By this we derive the word padmanaabhah.Otherwise the word would be "padmanaabhih".In usage the word is akaarantha.But there is no direct rule to grant this.So we,followers of panini, justify this by the half of the above aphorism "ach".
