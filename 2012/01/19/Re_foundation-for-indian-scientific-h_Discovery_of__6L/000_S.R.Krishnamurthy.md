Dear Dr.Kalyanaraman,



Thank you for posting this precious press release. I had already advocated, in my book titled The Science of Hinduism (yet unpublished)that we should have a relook into the timeframe, marshalling the various scientific findings; that have come to light recently. But our Historical scholars are afraid of crossing the Lakshmana Rekha of Biblical chronology drawn by Max Muller. Ultimately, all evidences will surely converge on the Timeframe projected by Manu, the great Mathematician, cosmographist, and scientist.



It is a pity that most of our traditional scholars have no exposure to Sciences; and therefore perforce ignore the priceless scientific data that is abundant in our scriptures. I have produced some in my book; which seems to be Greek and Latin to them.



yours sincerely,

s.r.krishna murthy.
