Just a minute. What made you Siddhantakaumudi, and Kahsikavritti are  
secondary compositions and not the original study of Ashtadhyayi? Will  
you please explain what concept you have a fresh learning of original  
Astadhyayi?

I don't think one can teach simply the Mechanical Engineering  
Principles or a Manual to Engineers to a 5th standard student however  
he may be brilliant or however the teacher be efficient and novel in  
his approach. If you think so, you can consider of approaching  
original study of Ashtadhyayi without the help of these primary guides  
composed of the same Theories in Ashtadhyayi. (for you these are  
secondary compositions and not the original study of the principles of  
Ashtadhyayi.).
