Respected Scholars of this Group, Salutations. Please enlighten me in one thing. Which Dvaita was criticiced by Shri Shankara Bhagavathpada? Whether it was the Sankhya Dvaitha or the Dvaitha preached by Shri Madhvacharya of Udupi? At the time of Shri Shankara there was no Shri Madhwacharya . I believe that Shri Shankara did refute the Dwaitha of Sankhya which says the Prakruti and Purusha.  
 Thank you,  
 With Regards.
