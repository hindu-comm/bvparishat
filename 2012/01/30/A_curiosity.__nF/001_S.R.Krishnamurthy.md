Dear Dr.Mahabala Bhatta,



Your question is delighting; and need no answer and no explanation. The ignorant quarrel over absent issues. they cannot be taught. For the learned and seeing, even dwaita and vishistadwaita are only tools to understand pure Advaita, enunciated by the Vedas.

s.r.krishna murthy.

A perplexed student of Vedas.
