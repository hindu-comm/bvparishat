Namaste.

  

In the Mandukya karika 3.17 Bhashya Shankaracharya lists kapila, kaNAda, buddha, Arhata (jaina),’aadi’, etc. as 'dvaitinaH'. \[To this list we can add the pAtanjala-s, the pAncharAtra-s and the pAshupata-s too. perhaps the word 'Adi' in the above sentence is to include these..\]

  

स्वसिद्धान्तव्यवस्थासु द्वैतिनो निश्चिता दृढम् \|

परस्परं**विरुध्यन्ते**तैरयं न विरुध्यते \|\|१७\|\|

  

इतश्च मिथ्यादर्शनं द्वैतिनां रागद्वेषादिदोषास्पदत्वात् । कथम् ?
स्वसिद्धान्तव्यवस्थासु स्वसिद्धान्तरचनानियमेषु कपिलकणादबुद्धार्हतादिदृष्ट्यनुसारिणो द्वैतिनो निश्चिताः ...

  

But how are bauddhas dvaitins? This is my guess: In the KaarikA bhashyam for 4.99 Shankaracharya comments for the words: 'na etad buddhena bhAshitam' of the Kaarikaa:

  
// That the nature of the Supreme Reality is free from the differences of knowledge, known, and knower, and is without a second - this fact was not expressed by Buddha, though a near approach to non-dualism was implied in his negation of outer objects and his imagination of everything as mere consciousness. But this non-duality, the essence of the ultimate Reality, is to be known from the Upanishads only. This is the purport.//

  

I think that the Bauddha, though negated the entire objective world (dRshya), did not say that the dRk is 'of such and such nature'. The Upanishads alone specifically talk about the eternal nature of the dRk: न हि द्रष्टुः दृष्टेः विपरिलोपो विद्यते, अविनाशित्वात् । (Br.Upanishad).
This nityatva of the sat/chid vastu has not been spoken of by the Bauddha (as per the Bauddha darshana that was available at the time of Shankara. Scholars have said that Shankara's criticism of Bauddha was in line with Kumarila Bhatta's criticism of Bauddhas.)

  

Also, in several places across the prasthAnatraya bhashyam of Shankara we can see a pattern: He would take up the naiyAyika and the bauddha together for criticism. The former is given the name 'ardha-vainAshikAH' and the latter 'pUrNa vainAshikAH'.
