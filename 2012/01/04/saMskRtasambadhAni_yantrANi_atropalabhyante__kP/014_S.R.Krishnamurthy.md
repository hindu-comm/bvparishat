Dear Dr. Sumana,



Somehow, the words sanskrit Wikipedia do not go together. They sound repugnent. perhaps SanskRutavishwakoshaH would be preeminent. else SamskRutavakyapadeeya would be second best to start with. But the former suits the objects and will fit in with the personality of Sri cha. mu. krishna Shastri. Through you, I would appeal to Sri Dinesh Kamath to consider this change of name.



yours fraternally,

s.r.krishna murthy.
