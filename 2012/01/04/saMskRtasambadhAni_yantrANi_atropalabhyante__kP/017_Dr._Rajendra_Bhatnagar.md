Thanks a lot Prof. Murthy, I stand enlightened. In fact the idea  
occurred to me for I thought that the formation of the word  
'wikipaedia' itself is not an English word and must be traced back to  
Greek. It is a known fact that the vocabulary of English language is  
continuously on increase as the words in usage in other languages are  
being assimilated in it as soon as they become frequently used by the  
English writers. In what I wrote I betrayed the ignorance of the rich  
character of Sanskrit language but I thought of language as something  
living and that is so because there are speakers and writers who keep  
it alive. Once again thank you very much for your instructive message.
