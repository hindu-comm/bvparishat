Namaskarams,  
  
We are aware of the usage of Lunj lakaara with the association of MAA avyaya according to the sutra. But in the Gita Bhashya of Madhwacharya the usage of MAASTU prayoga can be seen, which sounds familiar with some of the famous sanskrit plays( but I am not sure though) and for this prayoga the commentator has quoted a Vartika for a gana sutra ".Amaanoona:pratishidhe....", I started locating this vartika in panini grammer books but yet could not find it. I am not a member of BV groups so sending mail to you. Please help me to find the source.  
  
Regards  
  
Krishna Prasad

अथ चेत्त्वमिमं धर्म्यं संग्रामं न करिष्यसि।

ततः स्वधर्मं कीर्तिं च हित्वा पापमवाप्स्यसि।।

तस्मादुत्तिष्ठ कौन्तेय युद्धाय कृतनिश्चयः।

निराशीर्निर्ममो भूत्वा युध्यस्व विगतज्वरः।। (भ.गी.)
