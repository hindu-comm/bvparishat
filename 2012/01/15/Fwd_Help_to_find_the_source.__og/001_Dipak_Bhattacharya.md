Mr. Krishna Prasad may kindly give some more details -- the whole sentence, methodical transliteration etc.  We do not know if it is a part of *am**āstu*. His question, it seems, is about the use of imperative instead of aorist as demanded by Pāṇini’s *māṅi luṅ*. The imperative in *māstu* should be regarded as an irregularity, but this is found also in the Vedas. Cf., RV. 8.103.12 *mā́ no hṛṇ**ītām átithir vásur*; also Gobhila Gṛ.Sū.2.2.13 *m**ā savyena dakṣiṇam atikrāma *etc. Irregularities will be found in the epics too. In later Classical Sanskrit this is very rare.
