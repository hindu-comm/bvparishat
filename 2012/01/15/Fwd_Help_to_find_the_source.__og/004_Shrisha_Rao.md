\> Both mā śucaḥI’Do not relent’ and mā śaṅki ‘I must not fear’ are Pāṇinian as both the verbs are in luṅ without aḍāgama and offer no problem. Māstu on the other hand has loṭ with mā. Such un-Pāṇinian form occurs in mā kuru dhanajana yauvanagarvam

It is my understanding that मा is used when an निषेध of inviolate nature is intended; a negation using न is generally applicable but may have specific exceptions, cf. the grammarians' नञा निर्दिष्टमनित्यम्. Thus मा कुरु धन-जन-यौवन-गर्वम् is intended to say that one must not under any circumstances be prideful in the matter of one's wealth, kinship, and youth; there are no exceptions to the prohibition. On the other hand, न हिंस्यात् सर्वा भूतानि is a general principle that has some specific exceptions, including the rule अध्वरे पशुं हिंस्यात्.
