We have the very well known usage in the Bhagavadgita:  
  
*सर्वधर्मान्* परित्यज्य मामेकं शरणं व्रज ।  
अहं त्वा सर्वपापेभ्यो मोक्षयिष्यामि मा शुच: ।।   
  
In Brahmasutra 1.1.2. bhashya of Shankaracharya we have this usage :  
  
....जगतो न गृहीताः स्युरित्याशङ्क्येत, *तन्मा* शङ्कीति योत्पत्तिर्ब्रह्मस्तत्रैव स्थितिः प्रलयश्च त एव गृह्यन्ते । **..**  
  
Are these examples of the usage being discussed here?
