Dear Colleague,

*mā* is normally (Ṛgveda and Atharvaveda) prohibitive. That holds for *m**ā śucaḥ* and *m**ā śaṅki*. The most extensive discussion on this with all the examples available till 1967 is Karl HOFFMAN's *Der Injunktiv im Veda*. HOFFMANN takes into account Pāṇini’s relevant sūtras and takes decisions from extensive discussion of examples taken from the Ṛgveda, Atharvaveda and other Vedic texts. As the title will indicate HOFFMANN’s object of enquiry was injunctive that is preterite without augment (augmentless imperfect - aḍvihīna-laṅ, eg *k**ṇavam*; aorist - luṅ eg *karam*; and pluperfect (irregular according to Pāṇini)– eg., *d**īdet*). The exceptions too are arranged in a classified manner.

Many more instances are noticeable in the Paippalāda-Saṃhitā which were not available to HOFFMANN. Some were brought to notice by me (AVP Vol. II, Asiatic Society, Introd.). I hope younger scholars will do something on the new examples that throw new light on Pāṇini

Best
