All the discussions lead astray. The simple meaning of the quotation in quetty seems to be related to a गणसूत्र which enlists अ, मा, नो and न and Prof. Korada has answered to the points raised in the subsequent messages that there are two मा indeclinables, both निषेध, one with augmentation of ङ् and the other without ङ्. like आ and 

आङ्. Only माङ् is taken up in association with लुङ् by Panini in his सूत्र, and लुङ् is mandatory as सर्वलकारापवाद. But the other, without augmentation can take लोट् as the निषेध related to some verb from doing it contrast to विधि and all the लकार-s used for विधि can be used with this prohibitory अव्यय मा logically.

  

As for Vedic forms, यथादृष्टं छन्दसि विधिः is the commonly accepted principle in Paninian Grammar as Panini himself evades from any description allowing बहुलम् after the generally applicable description of the forms and suffixes. One can consider them as archaic or छान्दस and has to depend only on the commentaries for the explanations of etymology based on निरुक्त traditionally accepted. Free translations could be done out of any text at any cost. But यास्क followed a guide line "नैकं पदं निर्ब्रूयात्" Any word should not be described out of its context and he followed this in his निरुक्त through out generally to explain the meaning compiled in the निघण्टु. This may not be acceptable to all the scholars. Hence everybody is free to translate according to their knowledge of Gramar.
