Dear Colleagues,  

Theoretically the leṭ-ending may come after a vikaraṇāṅga eg *k**ṇavat*, luṅaṅga eg. *karat*, *jo**ṣiṣat *etc. and liḍaṅga eg. *jihi**ṃsat*(*i*). The aorist has seven varieties, liṭ-aṅgas have one. Ignoring the uttamapuruṣa we get at least six endings for each aṅga. Add three by *ita**ś ca lopaḥ parasmaipadeṣu. *Then 90 (10x9) forms are theoretically possible for the vikaraṇa-aṅgas; 63 for the aorist; 9 for the perfect. That makes 162. Add the 3 uttamapuruṣa endings not specially mentioned by Pāṇini. That makes 54 additional forms. We get 216 in all. I wonder if a mail will have the capacity to carry such a bulk.

It is better to consult Macdonell. I heard that Chlodwig Werba has improved upon Macdonell but have not seen that.

If that is not regarded as self-promotion Dr. Bhaṭṭa may kindly consult ‘Utilising Pāṇini in Vedic research’ by Dipak Bhattacharya *Sanskrit Studies and Research Methodology*, Scottish Church College, Kolkata 2007 for some hints at the formidability of the task and the Aegean stable that has to be cleared before that. There is a tendency to fail to distinguish between a general alternative and a *j**ātipakṣa *rule that is given to show the validity of some forms but not for employment at will or for the defence of transmitted corruptions as often found in poorly preserved texts like the Maitrāyaṇī and the Atharvavedas.

Best
