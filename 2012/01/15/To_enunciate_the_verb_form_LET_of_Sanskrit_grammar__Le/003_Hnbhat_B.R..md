A Good question for Panini. In fact he didn't say his Grammar is meant exclusively for a लौकिक words or वैदिक words. He could have omitted at all just like other काशकृत्स्न, हैम व्याकरण-s. It is for this inclusion of वैदिक usages पाणिनीयव्याकरण is considered as वेदाङ्ग and not any others.

  

Further comments on this point are welcome from the scholars and Grammarians. If बहुल can achieve everything, there was not any necessity to invent so vast अष्टाध्ययी, and add then and there छन्दसि बहुलम्. The reverse also could have been done with ony one सूत्र बहुलम् for any usage in beginning itself. "आर्षम्, बहुलम्" as done in हेमचन्द्र’s व्याकरण which deals with classical Sanskirit words as well as मागधी considered as आर्ष which are irregular forms of the corresponding Sanskrit forms.
