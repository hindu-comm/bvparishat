Namaste.  
  
Among south Indians it is not uncommon to find names such as these:  
  
subbaraman, subbarayan, subbakrishna, subba rao, subbamma and even subbalakshmi and subbulu (feminine). subbudu and subbarayudu are also there among Telugu people. I would like to know what this 'subba' means in all these names. Some people say that 'subba' is a short form for 'subrahmanya'. In that case how does it go with subbalakshmi?
