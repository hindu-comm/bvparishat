'subba' is not merely used with feminine names, as suggested in one place. For example, 'Subbanna' is one of the male names. It is also possiblethat this appellation with the name, widely used only in south India, may be an अपभ्रंश of the word 'Shubha' to start with, with the lakshmi; and later practice diversified for use in all names.
