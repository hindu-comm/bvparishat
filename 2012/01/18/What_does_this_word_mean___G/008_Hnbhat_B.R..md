ಸುಬ್ಬ, ಸುಬ್ಬಿ, ಸುಬ್ಬು subba is used in Kannada in male names, as usual reminding subbaraaya or subramanya (of Kukke), further found, subbi, subbu in feminine forms. Tamil also has got suppa, subra, subba + mani in masculine names, possibly derivable from सुब्रह्मण्य if one wants. Once it comes to Tamil domain, it can freely further derived into subbi, or subbu, or even suppaa or subbaa. No matter whether it has got any relation with the original word and then lakshmi can be added. MS name is adopted according to Kannada practice, also should be Subbu or subbi (or subba without mani) a possible derivation. In Tamil and Kannada it is common formation "subbu" as in Tamil.and subbi is simply derived feminine form from Subba itself.  
  
  
For tracing the word one can safely (but artificial so far as I am concerned) either to शुभ्रा (लक्ष्मी), which would be derived as सुब्बा, and सुभ्रू can give the cognate word सुब्बु. But this will be far fetched, whereas it can be easily derived from the masculine corrupt form subba, (subbarao, subraaya, supramani, chuppamani, chuppu, etc. in different ways as pet names called frequently according to their convenience and fashion of their language and family circles). This is a commonly found fact in many languages. Each have their own distinct way of forming pet names from the popular proper names.
