Dear Sri S.R.K.Murthy,

Kindly accept my congrats for your honest and open-minded write up.Most of the Indian scholars including many.Sanskrit scholars,have stopped independent thinking about our chronology Physically we are independent,but,mentally many of us exhibitslave-tendency in blindly following what the westerners-who had less knowledge of our culture-said,with ulterior motives.We go on teaching the same old texts with some minor changes here and there and hardly look deeply into our glorious past,which is still hidden in the unpublished manuscripts.The urge for indepth study is dwindling and there are only a few scholars like Prof.R.N.Iyengar who are trying to revive the Sanskrit lore to accord it the due credit.The mind-set of technicallyso-called Sanskrit scholarsis still not much open to accept such valuable research,which is being done by the technicallyso-called non Sanskritists like Prof.Iyengar.When Sanskritists-most of whom have little scientific outlook and scientists-some of whom are not so sound in Sanskit-come together to work on scientific aspects concealed in Sanskrit Literature,then only,there is some hope of a revival in our outlook to our glorious past.That is what we intend to do at our Centre here in Bangalore.You are welcome to contact us in this regard and then some tangible workcould be undertaken jointly,with a view to discovering the scientific basis in our Sanskrit literature

I sincerely request my scholar-friends to pardon me if some caustic words are used by me in this mail.That is only self-introspection and no intention to hurt anybody individually or as a class.

With New Year Greetings to all..

Sincerely yours,

Prof.S.Y.Wakankar
