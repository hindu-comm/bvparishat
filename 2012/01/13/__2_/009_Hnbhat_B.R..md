Done. Suggestion well received.

  

I was thinking long ago the same thing..

  

If the member wants REALLY TO MAKE USE OF THE BVP group for any scholarly discussions and continue, he can apply for new membership with another mail ID. Otherwise, continuing with this kind of spam messages, will compel the moderators to block the ID also. It is possible the mail ID is hacked.
