Dear Sri Tripathiji,  
My sincere and warm congratulations to you and to every member of your team for  
the very successful and excellent arrangements done for the 15th World Sanskrit  
Conference at New Delhi.  
It was indeed a memorable event that went smoothly and all of us Sanskrit lovers  
cherish those 6 days of Sarasvata activities very much.  
Yours  
Ganesan
