Dear Dr. Bhagwan Singh,



I read the first chapter you have kindly posted; and I am very pleased to state that it echoes; of course, in a scholarly manner, the very same sentiments that I have written in the first chapter of my yet unpublished book titled 'The Science of Hinduism'. There I have dismissed the declaration of Bala Gangadhar Tilak that Aryans were autochthonous of the Arctic region. When I metion the consensus between our views, I must also mention the vast difference between our styles - the pedestrian style of mine is no match to your profundity of presentation.



I do hope that you have taken cognizance of the candid opinion of Rt.Rev. Gaspare Garresio, the polylinguist, who translated the Bengali recension of Valmiki Ramayana to Italian, on the subject you have taken up.



With warm regards,

s.r.krishna murthy.
