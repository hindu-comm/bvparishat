 Actually this problem of duality and reality is discussed much more deeply in the Brahma Sutra Bhashyas of Shankara as well as Madhva. This relates to metaphysics, not theology.



 Acharya Madhva's *Tattva-Viveka* takes it much further to go on and create a metaphysical theory of reality.



 Western scholars cannot see beyond Hindu-Buddhist duality because their understanding of Vedanta is limited and also because they assume that Vedanta means only Advaita. This is partly the influence of RK Mission also who reject anything that acknowledge duality, including even Sankhya.



 I find Buddhist thought quite limiting as metaphysics. Much is made of A.N. Whitehead's 'Process as Reality', but it is confused and falls far short of Patnajali and the Vedantic thinkers.



 I am giving a talk on this subject on Friday.

**DUALITY AND REALITY: VEDANTA AND QUANTUM PHYSICS**

**Speaker:  Dr Navaratna Rajaram**

**Venue: Indian Institute of Science, Choksi Hall**

**Date and Time:  6:00 PM, Friday, 3 February 2012 Tea at 5:45 PM**

***ABSTRACT***

 Although extraordinarily successful, quantum mechanics, after more than a century after Planck and Einstein pioneered the subject, still lacks a firm foundation. For example the idea of reality—whether it has an objective existence or just an illusion of our own making—has not been resolved and remains controversial. Recent results like Bell’s theorem and Alain Aspect’s experiment have cast further doubts on the foundations of quantum physics.

 Some of the central problems addressed by Vedanta are the same as those arising in quantum physics— duality and reality. The great medieval thinker Madhva (1238 – 1317) addressed these issues, especially of reality in a metaphysical work known as *Tattva-Viveka.* He asserted that “There exist two orders of reality— independent and dependent (or unmanifest and manifest).” He further noted: “The knowledge of the many through knowledge of the One, is to be understood in terms of the preeminence of the One.” 

 Madhva’s view was echoed by physicist Erwin Schrödinger, himself a committed Vedantin. He wrote: “It is quite easy to express the solution in words, thus: the plurality that we perceive is only *an appearance*; *it is not real*. Vedantic philosophy, …has sought to clarify it by a number of analogies, … \[of\] the many-faceted crystal which, while showing hundreds of little pictures of what is in reality a single existent object, does not really multiply the object.”

 All this indicates that a school of thought in philosophy of science that draws on Vedantic metaphysical thought that is at the same time scientifically rigorous can prove to be a fruitful area of research.

Dr Navaratna Rajaram is a mathematical scientist who has written extensively on history and philosophy of science. He has lectured on this topic at several universities in the U.S. and U.K. including MIT, Universities of Manchester, Chicago and Massachusetts. He is currently working on the book *Quantum Yoga and the Meaning of Reality: Science and Vedanta in pursuit of a common goal.*
