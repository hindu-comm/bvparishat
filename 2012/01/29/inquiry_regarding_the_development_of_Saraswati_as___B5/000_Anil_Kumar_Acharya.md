Respected Scholars,

Namaste.

We all worship Saraswati as a goddess of knowledge. But this goddess seems to be a personification of river in general or river Saraswati in special. Though later on Saraswati gets the status of an independent deity but has not reach the status of a \*cult\* similar to that of Gaanapatya. Therefore I am interested to know that â€“ is there any research on the development of Saraswati as a river goddess to Saraswati as a goddess of knowledge? And how ancient is the tradition of suffixing Saraswati along with the names of the enlightened personalities?

Thanks
