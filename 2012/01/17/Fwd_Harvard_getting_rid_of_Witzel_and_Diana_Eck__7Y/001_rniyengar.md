Dear Dr.Rajaram  
Your article is informative and balanced! I have great respect for  
Harvard for its Oriental Series publications, even though they can not  
be taken on their face value, particularly in translation. In recent  
times I have enjoyed reading the works of (Late) Prof.Ingalls. {Also  
his article on MBh in BORI J\]. His book on Navya-nyaaya is eminently  
readable by non-specialists (like me). I have been following the  
papers by Witzel on and off. Some articles in EJVS promoted by him are  
quite informative. But one could easily sense, from the tenor of his  
writings, that he is biased against India. Over years he seems to have  
become quite open about this. Perhaps he never wanted to be an  
Indologist, but circumstances might have forced him to become one!  
However, from the time Witzel coined the Sanskrit acronym HINA for  
"Hindus In North America",my respect for him vanished!  
  
sincerely,  
  
RN Iyengar
