I fully agree with Sri. Srivatsa.  
It is high time that we, Bhaaratiiya scholars embarked upon editing many of thes  
unedited and unpublished texts with our available manuscript resources fully  
using our deep knowledge in the vast Sanskrit literary corpus.  
We could observe good number of european researchers in the just concluded 15th  
World Sanskrit Conference working on critical editions of various texts and that  
too in the domain of Agama/Tantra whereas very few are seen working on these  
areas from our indian scholar fraternity.  
Now that under National Mission for Manuscripts more and more old and unedited  
texts are unearthed, it s the duty of our scholar community and especially  
youngsters to undertake the task instead of depending on the editions and  
studies brought out by western scholars.  
Ganesan
