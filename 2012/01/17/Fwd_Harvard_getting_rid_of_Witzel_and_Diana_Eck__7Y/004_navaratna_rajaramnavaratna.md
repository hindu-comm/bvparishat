Dear Professor Iyengar:



 A basic problem with Witzel is he has never had enough money and he can be bought. Also, for all his bluster, he is a weak character who can be pushed around.



 What does it say for his character that Harvard has closed down his department and sent him on 'leave'?



 Basically he and his discipline are both anachronisms heading into oblivion. So I don't take him seriously.



Best regards,

N.S. Rajaram
