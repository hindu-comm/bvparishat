hariH OM,  
  
 I don't know anything about other works of the harvard oriental series, but their publication of the sAmaveda archika samhitA along with three bhAShyas of mAdhava, bharatasvAmI and sAyaNa, wrongly titled by them as sAmaveda samhitA (which has to contain gAna, archika samhitA = only R^iks no gAna) shows them in a very poor light. It is ridden with multiple typo errors in every page. The insult to injury is in the form of a preface to the book written by the worthy, witzel.  
  
 If with towering vidvAns like B. R. Sharma, not to talk about the infinite resources at their command, harvard produced such a despicable work, one can only pity them. I think it is beyond time for bhAratiiya vidvAns to take upon themselves the mantle of publishing immaculate works in series. Saraswati Mahal, Nirnaya Sagar, Chamarajendra Vedaratnamala etc. seem "so yesterday". The work of the Mahesh Research foundation of Varanasi which has published vedAnta related books is a stellar example of our times.  
  
svasti,  
 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,  

shrivathsa.
