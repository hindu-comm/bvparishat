*January 17, 2012*



 I have learnt from some friends that the Harvard Administration, President Faust in particularis extremely unhappy with Diana Eck and Michael Witzel for creating this embarrassing row just before her trip to India. They are of course upset that Faust has closed down their department and downgraded their positions.



 Being tenured professors, Eck and Witzel cannot be dismissed but they have been pressured to go on 'leave' for the spring 2012 semester. The contract does not include summer, so they will not be back before the fall semester (September). This may be enough time for the administation to find a legal way of getting rid of them.



 I am not particularly interested in the Harvard internal politics but in the history leading up to it and future trends in India-U.S. relations. I have tried to coverthe historical contextin the following article.
