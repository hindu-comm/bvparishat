**SHALAAKAA PAREEKSHAA**

**  
**

Shalaakaa Pariksha is one of the fool proof techniques evolved by our ancient vedic & shaastric scholars in order to foster learning of ancient texts pertaining to a shaastra in detail. The word shalaaka has many meanings and the meaning that could be applied here is “ a small metal or a wooden stick.

Pre-requisite for shaalaka pariksha

1. Before the Shaalaka pariksha, Vidyarthi is taught a particular grantha( text ) by the Guru in a particular shaastra / kavya, along with relevant commentaries.

What happens in Shalaaka pariksha?

1. A particular grantha is prescribed as the portion for the shalaaka pariksha

2. Reputed Scholars are invited to test the knowledge of the student in the particular grantha.

3. The shaalaka pariksha has three rounds.

4. In the first round , the student is expected to know the moola text of the grantha by heart. During the shalaaka pariksha ,the shalaaka is inserted in the book three times by the scholar and every time the vidyarthi is expected to recite the moola grantha that is present in that page. Based on parameters like apt pronounciation ( in accordance with shiksha shaastra), photographic memory the student enters the second round.

5. In the second round, the shalaaka is inserted in the book three times the student is expected to give commentaries on the portions in that page at every instance.

6. In the third round, similarly the student is expected to answer questions pertaining to the portions on the page, where the shalaaka insert happened.

7. Overall the parikasha has three rounds and nine questions.

Such techniques by scholars in ancient days fostered students to study shaastra granthas in vyakarna, tarka, mimasa, kavyas, etc. This technique ensured that the student obtains thorough knowledge of the text completely.

Even today shalaaka pariksha is prevalent. Recently Samskrita Bharati organized one such on 8^(th) January 2012 at Aksharam in Bangalore.
