 One has only to compare the extraordinary vitality of Sanskrit Studies in India with the picture of gloom and doom in so-called Sanskrit Departments in the U.S. to see where the future lies.



 Harvard doesn't even have a Sanskrit Department anymore-- only something called South Asia Studies as part of its Divinity School, with its faculty like Diana Eck courting Islamists for sponsorship.



 Don't believe cries of 'Sanskrit in danger' meaning give us money or Sanskrit will disappear. Let it flourish in India and die in the U.S. Sanskrit courses there-- at the level of high school level introductory courses are drawing no students.



 Let these departments die a natural death.
