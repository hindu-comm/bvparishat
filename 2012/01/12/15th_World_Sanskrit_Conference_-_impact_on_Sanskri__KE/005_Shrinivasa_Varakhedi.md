As it is mentioned by Dr. Rachuri Acharya, for the first time in the world conference a special session was devoted to discuss issues related to Sanskrit pedagogy. This session was convened by Vidvan Cha Mu Krishna Shastry ji. I heard that it received a warm welcome and attention in the conference. The resolution to teach Sanskrit in Sanskrit language is welcome by one and all. Thanks....
