Dear Scholars!

I am here to thank and congratulate Radha Vallabh Tripathiji and his team for having hosted WSC in a nice manner.

It was a great success.  
Every participant was given equal attention. And punctuality was carefully maintained.

The topics chosen for the Pandita parishad were relevant and significant.

And some of the presentations were simply beautiful like those of Mani Dravid Sastriji, Warkhediji as well as Veeranarayana Pandurangiji.  

But, we can not ignore the fact that papers of eminent researchers were rejected, I can cite one example - Prof. K. V. Vasudevan from Kerala. I happen to here some other cases also. The gravity of the injustice is magnified when one sees that the standard of a few of the accepted papers were not up to the mark.

I am not lodging a complaint. Just making a point.

Let me mention once again that the conference was a great success.

As stated by Rajaram, let us appreciate the painstaking effort put in by RV. TRIPATHIJI AND HIS TEAM.

One more thing. The KALPATARU contains valuable information regarding the personal biography of great scholars and pioneers in Sanskrit studies. Thanks to the brain and team behind.
