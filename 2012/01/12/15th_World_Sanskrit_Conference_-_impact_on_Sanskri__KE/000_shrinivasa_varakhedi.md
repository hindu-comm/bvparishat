Dear Scholars,

Hearty Congratulations to Professor Radhvallabh Tripathi Ji, and his team of Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan staff members for their painstaking efforts in making the 15th WSC a grand success. As you all know the 15th WSC was oragnised by Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan in association with the IASS in New Delhi last week. The week long programs, academic sessions, Pandita parishat, Kavi-sameelanam etc were held successfully. It was a fantastic event that every participant enjoyed.

The WSC was inaugurated by the Prime Minister in the presence of Kapil Sibal, HRD Minister and Prof. V.Kutumba Shatsry and Prof. Radhvallabh Tripathi on the podium. Thousands of scholars and heads of the institutions witnessed the program. All the academic sessions and deliberations started with a spl lecture by Prof. Ashok Aklujkar were remarkable. The books "Sixty years of Sanskrit studies in India and Abroad" and a souvenir "kalpataru" edited by Prof. RV Tripathi and brought out by RSkS were welcomed by the scholary community.

The Computational tools for Sanskrit Analysis that have been developed by Sanskrit consortium of seven Instt headed by Prof. Amba Kulakarni have been released by the PM. These tools were distributed to all delegates free of cast by TDIL, Govt of India. This was noteworthy.

The entire conference has a great impact on the studies of Sanskrit in National and International level.

I hereby invite the views from the scholars who attended the conference.

warm rgards,  
shrivara
