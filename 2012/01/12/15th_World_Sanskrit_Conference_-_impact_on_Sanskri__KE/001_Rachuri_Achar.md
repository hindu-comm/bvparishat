Dear Scholars,

  I also had the opportunity to attend the 15th WSC at New Delhi. At the outset, I would like to convey my sincere appreciation for all the efforts and planning that went into the successful organization of the event. Kudos to Tripathi Ji and his team who were behind his success. I had the opportunity to meet several scholars and exchange views and learn from them.

  One resolution that is worth mentioning was made on the final day of the conference where all scholars unanimously agreed and cheered when Sri Chamu Krishna Shastri spoke on the need to teach Sanskrit through Sanskrit just as English is taught in English and French in French!!

 I also had the opportunity to visit the stall put up by TDIL and look at the tools that were being demonstrated and give few suggestions for the improvement in displaying the search results so that they can be more useful for researchers.
