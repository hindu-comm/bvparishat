Dear Subramanian Sir!

The dreams in Sanskrit literature is a wonderful and vast topic which deserves serious research. The fifth act of Svapnavasavadatta contains a dream scene. The title of the play itself is based on the theme of this act. It is a wonderful creation of bhasa's genius.

The gist of the dream scene is like this : 'King Udayana, the hero of the play, happens to fall asleep in the bed ( in the summer house) which actually was meant for Padmavati. Now Vasavadatta, who is the blossom beloved of the King and whom he thinks as dead, comes and shares the bed ( there was only dim light)thinking that Padmavati is the previous occupant. Udayana sees a dream and talks with Vasavadatta. The latter realises that it is Udayana who lies besides her. But out of unflinching love for him, she happens to be with him and converses with him. Udayana was was not sure, even afterwards, whether he saw Vasavadatta in a dream or in real life. The scene gives an occasion for Vasavadatta to experience in absentia the depth of love of Udayana towards her. The mutual love between Udayana and Vasavadatta is beautifully conveyed toconnoisseurs. Bhasa's mastery over dramaturgy and human psychology finds a fine expression in the scene.

As has already been pointed out by DR. H. N. Bhatt dreams occupy a prominent role in Upanishads as well as in the later Vedantic discourses.

Prof. K. V. Vasudevan, a best frind of mine, has taken up a serious research on the topic. Interested scholars may interact with him. His mail ID is[kan...@bsnl.in]()  .
