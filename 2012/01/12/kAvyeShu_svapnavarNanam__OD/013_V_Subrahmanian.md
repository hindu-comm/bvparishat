Many Thanks Sir for the painstakingly given references. I have made a few comments with reference to a few of the verses. My intention in this search is to see how the phenomenon called dream is treated by various popular authors of our Literary/Vedic tradition.

I sincerely thank Vidwan Shri Sadasivamurthy Rani and Shri Parameshwar Puttamane for providing valuable inputs, again with great effort. I think whether it is day-dreaming (which is somewhat consciously indulged in) or dreams as part of one's sleep routine (where on has no control on them), they are generally dismissed as false, insubstantial. There are however exceptions where they can be indicators of some future events.
Some rare dreams have been reported where problems one had been working on in the waking get solutions in dreams. The renowned mathematician S.Ramanujan used to get solutions to mathematical problems from Lord Sri Narasimha of Namakkal, his IshTadevatA, in dreams and he would immediately note them on a slate/paper kept by his bed. Some have had mantropadesham in dreams and later had them confirmed by the very Acharya who gave it in the dream. I would still look for evidence / reference in the literary / other science field for the अयथार्थत्वम् of dream objects/events in general.   
  
With respectful regards to the scholars,
