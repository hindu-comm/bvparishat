The original source of the verse quoted by Saduktikarnamruta of Sridharasena in my previous message is from श्रीकृष्णकर्णामृत -

  

where the context is very natural. In the other, it is Krishna was lying asleep, and overhears the narration of Ramayana between some group, and gets enraged. I intended to post this verse. Instead one more उत्स्वप्नायित of Krishna from Sridharasena:

  

  

शम्भो स्वागतमास्यतामित इतो वामेन पद्मोद्भव

क्रौञ्चारे कुशलं सुखं सुरपते वित्तेश नो दृश्यते ।

इत्थं स्वप्नगतस्य कैटभरिपोः श्रुत्वा जनन्या गिरः

किं किं बालक जल्पसीत्यनुचितं थूथूत्कृतं पातु वः ॥२६१॥

ascribed to Mayura. More is there in the text. But let me see whatever there in the document in the previous post.
