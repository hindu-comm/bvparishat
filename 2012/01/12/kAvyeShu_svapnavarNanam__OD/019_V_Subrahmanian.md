I have been wanting to open a discussion on a closely related topic.
For the last several years I have observed that when I am under drugs like antibiotics or even paracetamol for fever my dreams are very vivid. I have been able to distinctly feel the difference in the type/quality of dreams during those occasions. I wonder if others share this experience. Though I have not raised the topic with any medical doctor, allopathic or ayurvedic, I have a gut feeling that there is a link between drugs (their chemistry) and the human mind. Maybe someone who has studied psychedelics could say something on this. Since Shri Iyengar mentioned this I feel emboldened to open my mind. I invite information/references about this phenomenon. If the topic is outside the scope of this forum kindly ignore my post.
