I think it is Sanskrit 98 font he has used and it cannot be used with uniocode fonts unless it is put into pdf format.

  

Anyhow, to the question raised by Subrahmanyam, here is a sentence from the episode of dream described by Bhanumati to her attendant:

  

akuśaladarśanāḥ svapnā devatānāṃ praśaṃsayā kuśalapariṇāmā bhavantīti śrūyate /

  

The episode is made use very beautifully by the narration of seeing a "nakula" (the very pun in the word is the essence of the episode), approached and touched her limbs and so on. The narration is like a man acts with a lover and she was afraid of it and it removed away her over garments "stanamshuka". Duryodhana overhears it and doubts about the chastity of her and was enraged at the misconduct of "nakula" his enemy, of the Pandava's mistaking the word for him.

  

kiṃ nāmātiśayitadivyarūpiṇo nakulasya darśanenotsukā jātā / tatkimanayā pāpayā mādrīsutānuraktayā vayamevaṃ vipralabdhāḥ

  

At last she mentions she was awakened in the early morning by the "sangita"

  

: tato 'hamāryaputrasya prabhātamaṅgalatūryaravamiśreṇa vāravilāsinīsaṃgītaśabdena pratibodhitāsmi

  

on which Duryodhana realized he mistook her speech. The point in this episode has been emphasized in the very beginning of the message, by which Bhanumati was encourage to share her experience of the dream with her attendant.

  

In "svapnavasavadatta" there is no "svapna" at all, but Vasavadatta, who was dead as far as he was concerned, was seen by accident, was taken to be seen as if in "svapna." if I am right in my memory. Hence the naming of the play.

  

In Venisamhara, it was cleverly embedded in the play, though impropriety lies in the शृङार following it in between the वीर which is the main theme of the play.

  

I remember there is one episode of dream, in यशोधरचरित or so as an elephant entering the womb of the heroine, which happened to be bodhisattva. It is a common feature of उत्स्वप्नायित the muttering in dream, as the case for गोत्रस्खलन in Sanskrit poetry which is taken as a cause for quarrel between the couples. One more short episode of उत्स्वप्नायित is the beautiful verse of

Hope the above verse is readable from the image. It contains the words spoken towards लक्ष्मी in his dream by Krishna and राधा hearing them becomes jealous and angry and reproaches him for sharing her love with another woman. And the beauty of the poem lies in that all the words are interpreted as applying to राधा herself and he pacifies that he had not been thinking of any other girl rather than herself even in his dream.

  

In the first it is पद्मे vocative, and as applied to राधा, the same word is taken as adjective to त्वन्नयने पद्मे and all others equally apply for both. Another is this one:

  

कालिन्दीपुलिनान्तवञ्जुललता कुञ्ज कुतश्चित्क्रमात्. सुप्तस्यैव मिथः कथाजुषि शनैः संवाहिकामण्डले ।

वैदेहीं दशकन्धरोऽपहरतीत्याकर्ण्य कंसद्विषो.

हुं हुं वत्स**धनुर्धनुरिति**व्यग्रा गिरः पान्तु वः ॥२६४॥

  

No need to comment. Listening to the story of Rama told by his mother, Krishna goes back to dream and stretches forward his arms for reaching his bow in the dream. These are only I could gather. More are expected from the word file attached by Mr. Parameshvara. which I could not read right now.

  

Hope they also contain some more episodes in other poems or नाटक-s.He has sent Sanskrit 98 fonts in the zip with the software I hope so that it can be read by everybody downloading and installing the fonts. Thanks for the help.
