**National Seminar on Integrated Education**

Purnapramati has conducted three seminars, all focus on education. The inaugural seminar was held in Feb 2011, focusing on**Challenges in Contemporary Education Systems and Way Forward**. The second one was held in March 2011, with theme as**Learning Methods: Beyond Boundaries**. The Third in the series was a seminar, delivered byDr. Devasena Desai, apsychologist and parent counsellor, on**Parenting**. The current seminar is focussed on the central idea of Purnapramati:**Integrated Education**.

The present society has two streams of education. The modern education, based on contemporary fields of knowledge and taught in regular schools, is designed towards meeting socio-economic needs of a person. On the other hand, our classical subjects, with philosophy as their cornerstone and taught in traditional institutions, were designed to give a perspective on some core issues of life and lifestyle. Though our lives need both, these two exist in isolation today. Purnapramati’s mission is to provide**integrated education**, through a school, where a child can learn the foundations, in reasonable depth, of these two systems and thus become a holistic individual.

This is aday-long “National seminar on Integrated Education” on**29**^(**th**)**January 2012**, where distinguished speakers and personalities will speak and discuss topics related to Integrated Education. The seminar will host chief guest, Shri Rajendra Singh, chaired by Padmashri Bannanje Govindacharya and hosted by Dr. Gururaj Karajagi.
