dear all

sorry for creating a problem for all by allowing this kind of mails. we dont know how people like this one got in here. we are taking care offcourse. but hacker are more intelligent than us.

  

But I am afraid that many people we met in WSC feel that BVP should be maintained very carefully so that no unnecessary and fake messages make entry into this academic forum.

  

**It is very heartening to see many people send more and more messages without any real issue. I request all the members to stop this kind of messaging. please remember that this is a forum for serious academic discussions only. so please avoid unncessary things. dont waste valuable time of serious researchers. **

**  
**

**some people are even complaining that there are too much messages of only greeting like new year messages or others.**

  

please discuss serious things only or otherwise we will kill this forum.

अथ चेत्त्वमिमं धर्म्यं संग्रामं न करिष्यसि।

ततः स्वधर्मं कीर्तिं च हित्वा पापमवाप्स्यसि।।

तस्मादुत्तिष्ठ कौन्तेय युद्धाय कृतनिश्चयः।

निराशीर्निर्ममो भूत्वा युध्यस्व विगतज्वरः।। (भ.गी.)
