Namo Mahadbhyah,

Couldn't help butrespectfully mention that the discussion drifted from the subject of Mahaapatakas/Upapaatakas. However revertingto the discussion, I wanted toknow if their is any paryaya karma/krama in the puranas/smritis (akin to vaidika chandraayana etc..) defining the austerities to overcome the paatakas. It sounds too vague that Hari naama ucchaara alone can absolve one from the Mahapaatakas (the very name/claasification suggests so) unless scoupled with some karma like daana, japa, etc.. Also what could be the purport of "Japato naasti paatakam"?

Namaskarams
