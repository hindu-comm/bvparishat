Dear Dr. Yadu Moharir!

Namaste!  

Please once again read my earlier reply to your previous mail.  

My intention in that was never to vouchsafe that Gods will definitely do all the things like removing our sins. I never assure that they will issue licenses to the sinners to commit more n more sins through out whole day n night n finally to recite the names of the gods.  
I neither support nor deny this belief.

My only concern is to show that as you said only HARI alone is not given prime or first place in our SIN removing GODS by our ancestors.(Pl. go through the last lines of your mail also). As your mail sought help from other scholars I have given some other instances where other GODS and GODDESSES are also praised as our SIN destroyers. I have just given the purport of those prayers to show that they are also said to be SIN destroyers not only HARI. I can even give a grand list of such prayers from all the 18 puranas and other sources.  

But as far as my personal opinion is concerned I am silent.  

According to me as far as the matters like FAITH, SRADDHA, BHAKTI, SPIRITUAL PRACTICES and WORSHIP are considered SELF EXPERIENCE is always the BEST EXPERIENCE and it is the BEST SOLUTION too. No discussions of any good length in open debates can solve the problem. Because the logic and thoughts of the arguers never agree in such matters. They strongly oppose each others. Hence I never involve in such discussions.  

I am very kind of you for giving me this wonderful opportunity to answer you again.  

With warm regards,  

**Dr. Rani Sadasiva Murty**
