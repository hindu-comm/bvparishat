Dr. Yadu Ji!

Namaste!

This is in response to your question:

Can someone the their thoughts on why the saying " हरिर्हरति पापानि " may have been suggested by our ancestors in the first place.?  

As far as my observation extends the sloka "Harirharati Papani etc.," doesn't suggest any sequential preference Vishnu among the Gods. It recommends that the name of Hari even if thought of by evil people will set them free from all sins. (हरिर्हरति पापानि दुष्टचित्तैरपि स्मृत:। अनिच्छयाऽपि संस्पृष्टो दहत्येव हि पावक:॥).  
This sloka and all other slokas of this kind bear only contextual preference but not any sequential preference.  
As the famous statement "Vrataanaam Uttamam Vratam" promotes whomever we worship in a particular context is the PRIME GOD of our choice and he has all the abilities to remove our sins. It may be HARI or HARA or GANESHA or SRIMATA or any one else.  
Let us observe the following slokas  
1. Shiva DvAdasha smarana stotra  
द्वादशैतानि नामानि त्रिसन्ध्यं य: पठेन्नर:।  
कृतघ्नश्चैव गोघ्नश्च ब्रह्महा गुरुतल्पग:॥  
स्त्रीबालघातुकश्चैव सुरापो वृषलीपति:।  
मुच्यते सर्वपापेभ्यो रुद्रलोकं स गच्छति॥  
Here even the sins are specified from which one will be relieved by uttering the 12 divine names of Shiva.  
  
2. Similarly at the end of the Siva Pratasmarana Stotra it is said:  
एतानि शिवनामानि य: पठेन्नियत: सकृत्।  
नास्ति मृत्युभयं तस्य पापरोगादि किंचन॥  
  
3. In the BilvAShtakam it is said:  
  
त्रिजन्मपापसंहारं एकबिल्वं शिवार्पितम्।  
अघोरपापसंहारं एकबिल्वं शिवार्पितम्।  
मुच्यते सर्वपापेभ्यो एकबिल्वं शिवार्पितम्। etc.,  
  
4. In the SarvabharaNa Stotra of Tripuarasundari:  
सर्वज्ञानमयी देवी सर्वव्याधिविनाशिनी।  
सर्वाधारस्वरूपा च सर्वपापहरा तथा॥  
5. In prayer to Durva grass:  
सहस्रपरमादेवी शतमूला शतांकुरा।  
सर्वं हरतु मे पापं दूर्वा दु:स्वप्ननाशिनी॥  
  
These are just a few instances. Instance of this kinds can be seen in scores in our Stotra literature.  
  
All these stotras advocate that the respective Gods or Goddesses can relieve their worshipers from all SINs or the selected Sins. It doesn't mean that they alone can remove SINS. Nor even any sequential preference is specified any where. All these Stotras have Contextual preference only. Right form Hari to the Divine Durva grass all are sin relievers of the devotees.  
  
If we can trust in Puranasa, if we can believe that Puranas are written by Veda Vyasa and if we can consider the words of Veda Vyasa are valid for testimonial purpose the following statements of the Divine sage propagate that No difference between Hari and Siva should be maintained. Both are equally respected and worshiped.  
"शिव एव हरिस्साक्षात् हरिरेव शिवस्स्वयम्"  
"शिवस्य हृदयं विष्णु: विष्णोश्च हृदयं शिव:"  
and ""शिवाय विष्णुरूपाय शिवरूपाय विष्णवे"" etc.,  
  
So not only Hari or Hara even a Blade of Durva Grass, even the tail of Cow, even a drop of Ganga or even a fistful dust of our Divine Motherland Bharat has enough power to purify us all from all our Sins.  
Hence there is no question of placing first the expression हरिर्हरति पापानि etc.,  
With warm regards,

Namaste subrahmanian,

  

We have had discussion on the terms "hari" and "hara" on this list that ultimately never arrived at conclusion.

  

Can someone the their thoughts on why the saying " हरिर्हरति पापानि " may have been suggested by our ancestors in the first place.?

  

Thank you,

  

Dr Yadu

There are stotras one can recite with devotion and get peace of mind which implies freedom from sins. For example the Sri Vishnu sahastranAma is widely held to be a purifier. The dhyana shloka there assures this:  
  
तस्य लोकप्रधानस्य जगन्नाथस्य भूपते । विष्णोर्नामसहस्त्रं मे श्रृणु *पापभयापहम्* ॥ १२ ॥   
  
हरिर्हरति पापानि is a popular saying. Reciting Hari's names will free one from sins. The name 'KRShNa' itself means 'the one who draws all impurities from jiva-s'. So, reciting any God's name, stotras, participating in bhajans, visiting temples, going to pilgrim centers, etc. will purify one.
