"PrakshAlnAd hi pankasya dUrAd asparshanaM varam"

"Preventionis better than cure"



is awise saying forall times. When government is isselling liquor in arac shops, no body want to drink it because there is prayaschitta.

nor one doing "hare krishna" for drinkiing. Even drinking is injurious to health and no body refrains because of it.



"na himsyaa sarvaa bhUtAni" is advocating any injury to animate/inanimates. But only "yagIyaa himsaa, na himsA" is an accepted rule generally in Mimamsa.

  
pAradArika-prakaraNa in vAtsyayana's sUtra-s included to protect women from any possible attempts of molestation and not to teach paradAraganaba.



Sorry for interrupting the discussion.
