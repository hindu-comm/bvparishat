There are stotras one can recite with devotion and get peace of mind which implies freedom from sins. For example the Sri Vishnu sahastranAma is widely held to be a purifier. The dhyana shloka there assures this:  
  
तस्य लोकप्रधानस्य जगन्नाथस्य भूपते । विष्णोर्नामसहस्त्रं मे श्रृणु *पापभयापहम्* ॥ १२ ॥   
  
हरिर्हरति पापानि is a popular saying. Reciting Hari's names will free one from sins. The name 'KRShNa' itself means 'the one who draws all impurities from jiva-s'. So, reciting any God's name, stotras, participating in bhajans, visiting temples, going to pilgrim centers, etc. will purify one.
