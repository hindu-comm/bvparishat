Namaste subrahmanian,

  

We have had discussion on the terms "hari" and "hara" on this list that ultimately never arrived at conclusion.

  

Can someone the their thoughts on why the saying " हरिर्हरति पापानि " may have been suggested by our ancestors in the first place.?

  

Thank you,

  

Dr Yadu
