Namo Mahadbhyah,

Many many thanks for the valuable references. Irecollect that Trisuparna mantras of Mahaanaarayanopanishat also are a source of prayashcitta. Does Rudra prashna/homa also deal with it?More references would be valued (in addition to Veda mantras) since many veda anadhikaaris could also be benefited. Manyof them keep asking for it.

Dhanyosmi
