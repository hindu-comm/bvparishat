I am Malti from Mauritius .In my country there are many people interested in the learning of Sanskrit.We are provided with academic facilities at the MAHATMA GANDHI INSTITUTE but we are not able to fluently speak Sanskrit.I have seen your advert and am interested to have such a workshop here.A group of young people are interested to launch such an activity.Show us the way to achieve it. Any facilty offered by you for any Mauritian to attend the course.Thanks  

Regards

Malti
