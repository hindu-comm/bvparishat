Madam,

  

I have informed Sri Lakshmi Narayana of Aksharam, Bangalore, who has in turn contacted one Sri Vasuvaj who is in charge of arranging conversation courses outside India. Kindly wait for his communication.
I shall also pursue the matter independently.

  

Appreciating your interest in Sanskrit,
