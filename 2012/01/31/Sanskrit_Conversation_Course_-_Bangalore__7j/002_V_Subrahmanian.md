Madam,

  

It is extremely pleasing to hear about your collective interest in learning to speak in Sanskrit. I shall take this up with Samskrita bhArati which has operations in some 30 countries outside India and see how best your cherished dream can be realized. I shall be reporting to you to your private email.

  

Regards,
