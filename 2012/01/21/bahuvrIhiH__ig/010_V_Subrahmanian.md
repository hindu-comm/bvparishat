Namaste.  
  
When the information sought is not directly connected with the main topic under discussion it would be better to have a new header instead of interspersing an ongoing topic with a new enquiry. Here I think the two books referred to are not directly connected to the topic 'bahuvrIhi'. We can see already two/three more posts coming up in an unconnected topic.
