Respected Scholars!



I got an enquiry from a research student as follows:



Namaste. The Narakesarīyam (commentary for Subhāṣita Nīvī), which I am studying, contains several references to a lexicon of Bhaṭṭabāṇa, which seems to be similar to Amarakoṣa. I have searched the Internet, but have not been able to locate the text. Could you please tell me how to get a copy (either a hard-copy or a soft-copy)? An online version will also be equally useful.



I wish to seek the help of scholars to get useful inputs in this regard.



Thanks and with warm regards



Dr. P. Ramanujan
