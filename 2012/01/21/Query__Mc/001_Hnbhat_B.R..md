śabdaratnakara and theśabdacandrikā are two lexicons by

Vamanabhattabana or Abhinavabana.

The Sabdaratnakara is a comprehensive synonymic and homonymic dictionary. Critically edited with Sanskrit-English index by B.R. SHABMA, MVG-PG 16,Darbhanga, 1965.

  

The other lexicon has not been published so far. I could not find the work online. May be some others having a copy of it. Check in the Libraries nearby to confirm whether it is the same bhattabana quoted.
