Dear all,

I was reading a commentary on vRttaratnAkara of kedArabhaTTa.

There i came across a quotation in the commentary:

  

**वदन्त्यपरवक्त्राख्यं वैतालीयं विपश्चितम्‌ ।**

**पुष्पिताग्राभिधं केचिदौपच्छंदसिकं तथा ॥**

**  
**

This seemed to be borrowed from some earlier work on prosody. Can anyone tell me the source for this verse ?

**
