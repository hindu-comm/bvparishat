Dear members,  
  
Prof. K V Ramkrishnamacharyulu - a Paninian scholar, has been working in  
the field of Computational Linguistics for more than two decades. He is  
one of the key members of the Akshar Bharati group and has contributed  
directly to the development of various computational tools for Indian  
languages. He was instrumental in providing guidelines for developing  
annotation schemes for Sanskrit and Hindi (which are being extended to  
other Indian Languages as well) following Paninian Grammar. He had also  
introduced interdisciplinary programs in the field of Computational  
Linguistics and thereby trained and motivated many young students towards  
this interdisciplinary field.
