Respected Shri Subrahmanyam,



First of all I am not a Professor in these subjects or anything connected with these. Your traditional view is generally valid. But the most valid view is that of common sense and logic, based on common sense. Every thing old need not necessarily be gold. For any change or correction I suggest, IT WILL BE COMPLETE with arguments which are definitely open to debate. I do not want any body to accept anything blindly. It is unscietific. The same argument hold good even in case of old declarations; which we have to critically examine and accept. My complaint is that it is not the case today.



Even to understand the old texts, it requires understanding the facts recorded in the texts in the same sense in which they are recorded. I have shown that the commentaries are not upto the task at various places; which again is open to critical review.

This process is essential; without which the knowledge will remain only bookish; and loses its sense. For example, why Sandhyavandana is to be performed at the time of Sandhya only? I have discovered the reason; without which it makes little sense. What is wrong in worshipping at any other convenient time? Such questions will arise; and we should be able to give cogent answers.



We should also bear in mind that even Mimamsa and Jyotisha, etc started and developed only because some scholars pioneered. with these primary questions. Thye did sit idly throwing up their hands that they did not have any tools to facilitate any study. They started thingking, ie, jijnaasa.



Otherwise, you have seen in these columns that a question was raised by one scholar that brahma had incest with his daughter Saraswathi. A silly answer given by somebody blindly was quoted by another scholar; and the explanation was accepted. Thie is heinous crime - an apachaara. Are we putting our elders to shame? Giving a false thougtless explanation is an unpardonable sin. In such cases we have to delve into the truth and bring them out and give the correct explanation. If we ourselves, undermine our great texts just because just because so-and-so has said; who is going to respect our texts; our culture and our nation?



Today, the whole world is making fun of us because of such misintepretations; right at our doors. We scholars are pretending that nothing of that is heard or seen by us. At 75, I hate to see the impassivity of our scholars. According to Dharmashastras every scholars who does not react to that is part of the sin. That is what the Bhagavadgita is saying. My reseach shows that the interpretaions are wrong. But why no body questions but blindly accepts wrong explanations?



Indeed the explanation was given by one scholar almost endorsing the above allegation about Brahmaa. How come that a wrong explanation was accepted blindly.? One person belittled the Vedas; without knowing abcd of that. Why the scholars were blind to it? If you hold that that body of knowledge is really true and valuable; then all of you who had read that message must have rebutted that allegation. I challenged that person for an open debate. Why the silence of others?

Maunam sammatilakshaNam; it is said. Indeed though my foray into this field is very recent and not as deep as any of you, I did protest as a matter of duty; but many did not like my stand. One who does not have strong conviction about his ancestry,, anscience and glory of his past is as good as dead; it is said so by many a great person in the past. These are some questions that have been puzzling me; which I painfully project here. I am afraid that by this reslient attitude we will be depriving our future generations of their bright future which is their hereditary right.



Sorry; that my peroration will surely be unpalatable to many ; but I will be happy if my remarks make at least some scholars to sit up and think.^(Why did Shankaracharya roam the country four times? Just to get four deserving disciples! See his exposition of Aitareya Upanishad 1-3-12)[^(\[1\])](https://mail.google.com/mail/html/compose/static_files/blank_quirks.html#_ftn1)^(.) ^(iÉåwÉÑ ½rÉqÉÉuÉxÉjÉåwÉÑ mÉrÉÉïrÉåhÉÉiqÉpÉÉuÉålÉ uÉiÉïqÉÉlÉÉåÅÌuÉ±rÉÉ SÏbÉïMüÉsÉÇ aÉÉRÇû mÉëxÉÑmiÉÈ xuÉÉpÉÉÌuÉYrÉÉ lÉ mÉëoÉÑkrÉiÉåÅlÉåMüzÉiÉxÉWûxÉëÉlÉjÉïxÉÍ³ÉmÉÉiÉeÉSÒÈZÉqÉÑªUÉÍpÉbÉÉiÉÉlÉÑpÉuÉæUÌmÉ \|\| \[One who has slept fast and long with the false belief that the three sites (the right eye, the innate intellect and the heart) constitute the soul, does not wake up in spite of being battered by the sledge-hammer of grief born out of fits of crores of misfortunes\].)





yours fraternally.
