Blessed Soul,

  

It is with a great deal of joy that we announce the offer of a doctoral fellowship leading to a PhD in Veda under the auspices of University of Spiritual Research based in Napa, California, USA. We had discussed this with some of the participants when they were present in Tiruvannamalai for the First National Conference On RigVeda in 2008.
Now the reality is here. The fellowship is offered at the rate of one lakkh per year for three years.

  

We hope you will circulate this news among your staff and colleagues and encourage students to take advantage of this offer and apply. Here is the Home page link for your convenience:<http://www.usronline.net/USR/Welcome.html>

  

The in-depth research work Swami Sri Atmananda has envisioned is beginning to come to the publication stage and we happily look forward to soon making the announcement of availability of these resource books, which will be an invaluable asset to any research on the Vedas, in particular RigVeda.

  

We are also tentatively planning a second conference to be held here on or around March month. It is hoped that you may also be available to participate in this conference. We will keep you informed as dates become available.

  

With Warmest Regards,

  

Soumya
