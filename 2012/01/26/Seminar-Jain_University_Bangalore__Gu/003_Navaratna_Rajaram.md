Dear Dr Iyengar:



 Thank you for informing me about Dr Subbarayappa's talk.



Here is a column I wrote on the topic of excellence for the web magazine [WWW.FOLKS.CO.IN](http://www.folks.co.in/)




<http://folks.co.in/blog/2012/01/26/india-must-emphasize-excellence-to-reverse-slide/>



 I feel that your students and faculty would be interested in learning about recent findings about Vedic and Harappan Civilization based on archaeology and natural history. I can present it at your Center at a mutually convenient date.
