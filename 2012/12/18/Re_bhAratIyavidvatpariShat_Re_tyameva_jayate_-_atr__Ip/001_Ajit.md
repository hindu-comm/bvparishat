\> Dear Prof Bhattacarya,  
\>  
\> Veda first. Sanskrit grammar afterward. It makes sense, But if I remember correctly, Patanjali was complaining that Brahmin boys nelect studying grammar before start learning Vedas? He also says that one Sanskrit word correctly said according to grammar, reserves a place in Svarga. Thanks. N.R.Joshi.

\> A traditionally accepted ie authentic Vedic form can by no means be called incorrect. To say the least this accusation is preposterous. The deficiency is then of grammar not of the Vedas. The Vedas were not composed after the grammatical texts. The latter were composed after the Vedas.
