On 2012-12-30, at 10:24 PM, narayanan er rightly improved the writing of the verse mentioned byD.K.M. Kartha\<[dkmk...@gmail.com]()\> as follows:

दोर्भ्यां दोर्भ्यां व्रजन्तं व्रजसदनजनाह्वानतः प्रोल्लसन्तं  
मन्दं मन्दं हसन्तं मधुरमधुवचो मेति मेति ब्रुवन्तम्।  
गोपालीपाणितालीतरलितवलयध्वानमुग्धान्तरालं  
वन्दे तं देवमिन्दीवरविमलदलश्यामलं नन्दबालम्।।२८।। (श्रीकृष्णसूक्तिः-२८)

  

Imagine baby [K.r.s.na](http://K.r.s.na) as just beginning to crawl.Each time he pulls himself ahead with his two hands (dorbhyaam dorbhyaam). The sound of the (encouraging) call (aahvaana) given by the residents of Braj energizes him. He smiles gently (happy at his progress). He makes the sweet sound "maa, maa" (possibly standing for "maata.h, maata.h" or "mother, mother".) His inner being or heart (antaraala) is charmed by the sound of the bangles which are made to move by the clapping (taalii) of the palms of the Gopiis (the cowherdesses).

  

A literal translation of this charming verse into a single sentence of English should, of course, be done to ensure philological accuracy, but at the same time we should note that that translation will not convey the beauty of the original.

  

The poet has followed in his expressions the sequence of actions in the scene he describes. As the child pulls himself ahead, the people around say words like 'come to me, come to me". Their call or his own achievement delights the child. He probably begins to move toward his mother, saying "maa, maa". The mother's friends engage in rhythmic clapping from the sides, which makes the child ecstatic.

  

"taala/taalika/taalii" in the sense of 'clap' exists in Hindi, Marathi (.taa.lii) etc. Its occurrence in Skt is noted on p. 316 of vol. 2 of the Skt-German dictionary of Roth and Boethlingk (and possibly a few other dictionaries). The use of antaraala in the meaning 'antar-aatman, inner being, heart,' however, may be due to some regional influence (some modern Indian languages do use antaraala / antaraa.l a in the general sense of 'space,' not in the specific sense of 'space in between').  I will be open to better suggestions.
