Dear Prof. Jha,

  

The meaning you specify is possible (in fact, I too thought of it in my first reading of the verse) but it is not very likely or attractive. maa is a prohibitive, not just a negative. A 'do not do' type of response from a child to an ahvaana does not seem natural. A child is more likely to call for the mother and go in her direction. Not saying full words is characteristic of very young children. [anukara.na](http://anukara.na) ;sabdas and half words are not apa;sabdas or apabhra.m;sas or non-Sanskritic (cf. Mahaabh.sya in reference to .ltaka etc. and bhaamaa (for Satya-bhaamaa) etc.)

... here, words Maa, Maa should mean 'no' 'no', as if in response to the Aahvaana from the people of Braja (come, come or proceed proceed). By this , words Maa maa can be proved as the Sanskrit words.
