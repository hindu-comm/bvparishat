Two comments  
  
Firstly, दोस् is more accurately translated as "arm", and not "hand". In most examples I have seen, including those in रघु and कुमार epics, दोस् refers to the arm rather than the hand. Also we have दोर्दण्ड=भुजदण्ड=long arm (like a दण्ड), दोर्मूल = armpit (which is different from करमूल = wrist). दोर्भ्याम् व्रजन्तं = "\[to him\] moving with both \[fore\]arms" makes more sense "\[to him\] moving with both hands".  
  
Secondly, there could be a यमक in दोर्भ्यां दोर्भ्यां. From a grammatical point of view, does the द्वित्व of करण द्विवचन make sense? What Sutra (e.g. नित्यवीप्सयोः 8-1-4) explains the द्वित्व of dual करण here? दम्यते अनेन दम् + डोसि = दोस्. दोर्भ्यां = दमनाभ्यां being an adjective of दोर्भ्यां=बाहुभ्यां may be a possibility. There is no contradiction between the ऐश्वर्य भाव in दमनाभ्यां and माधुर्य भाव in the remainder of the verse since even in बाललीला, the Lord Kṛṣṇa's ऐश्वर्य is always present as evident in the killing of पूतना, तृणावर्त and शकटासुर even before Śrīkṛṣṇa started crawling on fours.  
  
  
पूतना तृणावर्त शकटासुर
