Swasti, Dearest Big Brother, Prof. Aklujkar Ji, here, words Maa, Maa
should mean 'no' 'no', as if in response to the Aahvaana from the people of Braja (come, come or proceed proceed). By this , words Maa maa can be proved as the Sanskrit words. Please consider and suggest. Warm regards,   
Shankarji Jha,  
Professor of Sanskrit,  
Deptt of Sanskrit,  
Panjab University,  
Chandigarh-160014, INDIA
