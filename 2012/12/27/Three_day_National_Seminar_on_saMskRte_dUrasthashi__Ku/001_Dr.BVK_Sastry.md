Namaste  
  
1. Congratulations from Dr. BVK Sastry, Founder, Yoga-Samskrutham University, USA ( - [www.ysam.org](http://www.ysam.org)) for initiating a good discussion.  
  
2. Due to time and travel cosntraints, I am not able to be physicaly present in the meeting and participate.  
  
3. I have been doing the Online Sanskrit teaching for last ten years using LMS ( advanced internet based  Learning Management System platforms - like WEB CT, Moodle, Blackboard) and the like for non-indian students. There are many challenges in developing pedagogy and class room teaching materials appropriate for global audience. The limitations of ' Sambhashana Shibira / Western models of teaching Sanskrit as a Classical language' break down very sharply and in no time ! The challenge starts from keying in devanagari in visual editors and browsers, voice training, right vocabulary. No less is the challenge of teaching basics of grammar. I am yet come across a good sanskrit dictionary -online which is student friendly . The online MW dictionary is not of much use in the beginning classes. SKYPE interactivity is good; but is not enough for interactivity. So are the efforts of materials on youtube and the like.  
  
4. Please let me know How may Yoga-Samskrutham University work with Rashtriya Samskrutha Samsthan in facilitating global Samskrutham learning.  
  
Regards
