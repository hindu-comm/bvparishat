**Looking for Old Books on Classical Music …**

**(1850-1950)**

**In connection with an ongoing research in music, old books on Carnatic Classical Music are being traced out. Books in the period of 1850s to 1950s are being investigated. Books in Malayalam, Tamil, Telugu, English are being sought.**

**  
**

**Sometimes a music lesson book used by your grandfather or grandmother might be lying around without you realizing its historic/research importance. I have been able to collect books dating back to 1853, 1892, 1896, 1904, 1919, 1934 etc from various houses in Trivandrum which have all been extremely useful in my research. Handwritten books also are important resources, provided they are dated before 1930s. Any other books/magazines which relate to music is also being sought.**

***If you have any such books, I humbly request you to please inform me. I shall make a digital copy of it for my research purpose and return the original intact. Please also pass on this message to your contacts...***
