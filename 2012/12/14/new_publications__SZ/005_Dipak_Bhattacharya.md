Two or three months ago the announcement of a book by an Indian author from Jaipur was forwarded to this List by Dr. Pandurangi. The announcement was accompanied with acclaiming words, purported to have been quoted from reviews. None here complained. But this was forwarded to the Indology List too. That faced severe criticism from Dominique Wujastik as a self-promoting advertisement. The reprimand said that while announcements were welcome advertisements were not. NICE!

Now, what about the book by Witzel? What is being questioned is not the quality of the book but the quality of the announcement. It is hardly an announcement. The words in its praise are meant for self-promotion. That is objectionable. But this time none has objected in the Indology List.

I am not interested in the book whose contents should not be absolutely unknown to me because I am well acquainted with the views of Witzel. But those who are should note the discrepancies in the goings on.
