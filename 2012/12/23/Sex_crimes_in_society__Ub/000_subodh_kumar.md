Dear scholars , kindly find given below the Vedic perspective on Sex crimes in society. I shall be grateful for scholars to help in improving this interpretation.  

1. Safety of females from internal enemies in society is King’s and is as important as protecting the nation from external enemies. 

हस्तेनैव ग्राह्यआधिरस्या ब्रह्मजायेयमिति चेदवोचन्‌ ।

न दूताय प्रह्ये तस्थ एषा तथा राष्ट्रं गुपितं क्षत्रियस्य॥ 

ऋ 10-109-3अथर्व 5-17-3

To prevent the young females from being led astray forcibly, their protection is the duty of the state and is just as important as providing protection of national territory from external enemies.





2. Dealing with Sex offenders

AV6.138 नपुंसक करने का उपाय – neutering

ऋषि:- क्लीवकर्तुकामोsथर्वा:, देवता:- वनस्पति

1.त्वं वीरुधां श्रेष्ठतमाभिश्रुतास्योषधे ।

इमं मे अद्य पूरुषं क्लीबं ओपशिनं कृधि । ।AV6.138.1

Administer to the sex pervert male, the fast acting herb that renders him impotent immediately . Further make visible marks on him to distinguish him from normal males.

2.क्लीबं कृध्योपशिनं अथो कुरीरिणं कृधि ।

अथास्येन्द्रो ग्रावभ्यां उभे भिनत्त्वाण्ड्यौ । । AV6.138.2

Alternatively king should ensure to crush the testicles of such sex perverts and make them impotent. Further such persons should wear female attire and display permanent visible marks that they have been made impotent.





3. क्लीब क्लीबं त्वाकरं वध्रे वध्रिं त्वाकरं अरसारसं त्वाकरं ।

कुरीरं अस्य शीर्षणि कुम्बं चाधिनिदध्मसि । । AV6.138.3

Both methods of neutering, by medicine or by crushing the testicles and permanent visual identification of such persons should be implemented.

4.ये ते नाद्यौ देवकृते ययोस्तिष्ठति वृष्ण्यं ।

ते ते भिनद्मि शम्ययामुष्या अधि मुष्कयोः । । AV6.138.4

There are two veins to testicles operating as passages of sperms from testicles. Surgically by a needle these veins should be punctured to render a person unproductive.

5.यथा नडं कशिपुने स्त्रियो भिन्दन्त्यश्मना ।

एवा भिनद्मि ते शेपोऽमुष्या अधि मुष्कयोः । । AV6.138.5

Even ladies perform these operations on such delinquent men.
