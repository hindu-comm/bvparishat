Namaste  
  
We have to note that learning the Veda is not just 'hearing' it recited by the Master. The disciples have to repeat what is being taught by the Master and heard by them. Only upon several such repetitions does the Veda become really learned by the disciples. It is called 'gurUcchAraNam anUcchAraNam'. It is correct that there was no use of books during the olden days.
