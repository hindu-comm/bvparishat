Namo namah sarvebhyo vidvadbhyaH.  

What was the name of the original Veda which Vyasa later divided into four ?  

  

According to<http://vedabase.net/sb/1/4/19/en2>     it is "*Formerly there was only the[Veda](http://vedabase.net/v/veda)of the name Yajur, and the four divisions of sacrifices were there specifically mentioned. But to make them more easily performable, the[Veda](http://vedabase.net/v/veda)was divided into four divisions of sacrifice, just to purify the occupational service of the four orders. Above the four Vedas, namely[Rg](http://vedabase.net/r/rg), Yajur,[Sama](http://vedabase.net/s/sama), and[Atharva](http://vedabase.net/a/atharva), there are the Puranas, the Mahabharata, Samhitas, etc., which are known as the fifth[Veda](http://vedabase.net/v/veda).[Sri](http://vedabase.net/s/sri)Vyasadeva and his many disciples were all historical personalities, and they were very kind and sympathetic toward the fallen souls of this age of[Kali](http://vedabase.net/k/kali). As such, the Puranas and Mahabharata were made from related historical facts which explained the teaching of the four Vedas. There is no point in doubting the authority of the Puranas and Mahabharata as parts and parcels of the Vedas. In the Chandogya[Upanisad](http://vedabase.net/u/upanisad)([7.1.4](http://vedabase.net/todo/upanisad/7/1/4/en2)), the Puranas and Mahabharata, generally known as histories, are mentioned as the fifth[Veda](http://vedabase.net/v/veda). According to[Srila](http://vedabase.net/s/srila)[Jiva](http://vedabase.net/j/jiva)Gosvami, that is the way of ascertaining the respective values of the revealed scriptures.*"

  

*BUT*

According to
<http://vanisource.org/wiki/Lecture_on_SB_1.3.21_--_Los_Angeles,_September_26,_1972?terms=Veda-vy%C4%81sa&first=The%20whole%20P%C4%81%E1%B9%87%E1%B8%8Du-va%E1%B9%81%C5%9Ba%20from%20Satyavat%C4%AB.%20So%20now,%20here%20it%20is&last=become%20completely%20well%20versed.%20There%20was%20no%20need%20of%20book>.

  

or which is the same<http://vaniquotes.org/wiki/Vedavyasa>

  

it is said "[Lecture on SB 1.3.21 -- Los Angeles, September 26, 1972](http://vanisource.org/wiki/Lecture_on_SB_1.3.21_--_Los_Angeles,_September_26,_1972 "vanisource:Lecture on SB 1.3.21 -- Los Angeles, September 26, 1972"):

*The whole Pāṇḍu-vaṁśa from Satyavatī. So now, here it is said that tataḥ saptadaśe jātaḥ satyavatyāṁ parāśarāt. Parāśarāt, semina given by Parāśara Muni in the womb of Satyavatī, satyavatyām. And cakre veda-taroḥ śākhāḥ. Veda, the knowledge, he divided. Vyāsadeva divided into many branches. Therefore Vyāsadeva is known asVeda-vyāsa. He expanded the Vedic knowledge. Formerly there was only one Veda, Atharva-veda. And this Atharva-veda was learned by tradition, by hearing from the spiritual master. There was no book. Therefore Veda is known as śruti. Śruti means hearing. The spiritual master will recite Vedic mantra, and the disciples will hear. Just like we chant Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra or any other Vedic mantra. You hear. But there was no need of book. His memory was so sharp that once heard from the lips of the spiritual master, the students become completely well versed. There was no need of book*."

  

Please clarify.
