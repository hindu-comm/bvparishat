I think the question raised is not attended to and elsewhere lead astray.

The clarification was clear in the beginning of the message itself, which was the name of the Veda called Yajurveda according to the first statement or Atharva Veda as claimed in the second series of Lectures. For the first, there are so many quotations from Purana-s as one has been cited by Narsing Rao. For the second, the Mundakopanishat statement, that Brhama himself preached para and apara vidya, including both Veda. Vedamga. etc/. So it was founded by Atharvan Rishi directly received from Brahma, the creator. which could be easily termed as Atharva Veda, as the statement seems to appear to stress. No mention of dividing it by Vyasa, but combination of Rik, yajus, sama and atharvan.

  

तस्मै स होवाच ।

द्वे विद्ये वेदितव्ये इति ह स्म

यद्ब्रह्मविदो वदन्ति परा चैवापरा च ॥ ४ ॥

  

तत्रापरा ऋग्वेदो यजुर्वेदः सामवेदोऽथर्ववेदः

शिक्षा कल्पो व्याकरणं निरुक्तं छन्दो ज्योतिषमिति ।

अथ परा यया तदक्षरमधिगम्यते ॥ ५ ॥

  

Both are called Brahmavidya by Brahmavit-s as it makes clear. If we restrict, to Brahmavidya, to Upanishads, the परा only, why the introduction with the four divisions. This seems to be the source for the second statement. undivided veda, which was called Atharvaveda.  

  

The question was how to solve or reconcile these two statements? and not any claim to equate Shruti with Hare Krishna mantra as earlier responses seems to have concentrated their attention. It just wanted to make the readers understand why "Shruti" was called by that name. Other way of explaining, transferred through listening from the teacher which obviously involves the hearing end. Only this much was meant in the explanation with Hare Krishna Mantra.

  

Now I have made the intention of the message clear as I read it. Any positive clarification on the question is welcome.

  

One suggestion is it may suggest contradiction of the statements of Purana-s with the Vedic statement of Mundaka. The other way, is also supported from a host of statement unanimously from the Purana-s. The clarification of this seeming contradiction was sought for.

  

So if the Veda-s were taught to Atharvan, the eldest son of Brahma, with the four Rik, Yajus, Sama and Atharvan, what did Vedavyasa do and when did he do the division to get the fame on him unless some reconciliatory solution is sought.
