==========Mod note========  

  
I would like to point out that the Hare Krishna people use the term  
"Vedic" indiscriminately - I don't see anything Vedic about the Hare  
Krishna mantra"  
  

No personal notes on religious groups. If you feel so, Please explain  
your claim by relevant extracts and make a different thread"  
One thread needs to have one subject or major issue.
