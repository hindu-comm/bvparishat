It is fairly obvious that much of the Rigveda has a distinct ritualistic flavor. The Rigveda also mentions the offices of many of the priests engaged in the ritual. This shows clearly that the several rituals were already developed when at least parts of the Rigveda were composed, which also indicates that some parts of the Yajurveda must have preceded some parts of the Rigveda. Most likely, the compositions of the Yajur and the Rigveda went on in parallel.  
  
Here is an interesting shloka from the Vishnupurana (3.4.11):  
  
एक आसीद्यजुर्वेदस्तं चतुर्धा व्यकल्पयत् ।  
चातुर्होत्रमभूत्तस्मिंस्तेन यज्ञमथाकरोत् ॥  
  
There was only one Yajurveda, which was divided into four by him (i.e. Vyasa). In that were created the offices of the four priests, by which the sacrifice was developed.  
  
As regards the other two Vedas:  

-   The Saman is the Rik set to music, which means it clearly came after
    the Riks -   There is reason to believe that the Atharva Veda was added later to
    the Vedic corpus, based on the term "trayi" in the Vedic literature

(As an aside, I would like to point out that the Hare Krishna people use the term "Vedic" indiscriminately - I don't see anything Vedic about the Hare Krishna mantra).
