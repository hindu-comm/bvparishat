Mr. Alexander

  

Greetings. Veda Vibhaaga is essentially, compilation into different sections.

  
It is as good as sorting of content according to the style of the hymns.

The names of Hymns Rik, Yajus, Saama were in vogue, since time immemorial. Veda Vyasa has sorted the same and imparted to different sets of students, each of them; so as todelineatethe primary study for their clans; in order to protect all the branches.

  

This imparting is referred to as Veda Vibhaaga.

  

Since the names of Rig, Yajus, Saama were already in vogue; it was already being referred as Rig Mantras and their Braahmanam; as Veda itself quotes apart from many other scriptures, much before the advent of Veda Vyasa (5000 years ago).

  

Sages Bhrugu, Atharva descendants of Sage Angiro Maharshi were the visionaries of sets of Many Hymns. Hence, these names are tagged on these Mantras.

  

Even at other Sets of Mantras, this type of references can be found in Veda.

  

In a nutshell, Veda Mantras were known by those names only earlier. Veda Vyasa has streamlined the texts in the names of visionaries or propagators of that particular sets of Mantras.
