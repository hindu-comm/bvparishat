Attached is interesting document which some of you might have read - it explains many concepts in Navya Nyaya using terminology in modern logic. (The title page appears at the end). It contains several references. Also, Kisor Kumar Chakrabarti has done a lot of research in Navya Nyaaya including comparing Navya Nyaya logic with Frege's logic (see: <http://philpapers.org/rec/CHASCB>). Incidentally, Gottlob Frege (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottlob_Frege>) is considered to be the founder of modern (western) logic.
