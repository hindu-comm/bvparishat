Respected Scholars, Namaste!



I read the book of Jagadish, "Shabdi shakti prakashika" in connection of my interest in "VarNavaada".



He uses Navya Nyaaya terminology like Avacchedaka, Pratiyogitva etc.
These words can be translatable in any language when one understands concept behind them. In my opinion "Avacchedaka"means "special to that case". Example from physics--Open and close vibrating tubes have certain exclusive harmonics. These are their Avacchedaka frequencies. Best example is Eigen values and eigen functions. These are Avacchedaka. I do not have Jagadish book in front of me. Otherwise I have given here some of his examples. The same thing is true with Pratiyogitva when compared with Samyogitva.



I feel right Sanskrit words for scientific English terminology make concepts easy to understand. Example Pratyabhijn√°ana can be used to explain calibration of the instrument. But when Indian knowledge is concerned it is the case of "always already given discourse". Nothing new to be found. Brahman already found. Thanks. N.R.Joshi
