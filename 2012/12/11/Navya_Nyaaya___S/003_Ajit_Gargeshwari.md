**Varna Vada:** Sankara refers to Upavarsha as the originator of Varna-vada, which contrasted with Spotavada of Bhartrhari. According to *Varna- vada*, the Varna-s, phoneme (speech sounds) , alone are real constituents of the word; and there is nothing else in the word apart from Varna-s.

**Avacckedaka:** The most distinctive and perhaps the most important technical terms inNavya-nyäya are 'limited' (avacchinna) and 'limitor' (avacckedaka). These expressions have many shades of meaning, most of which are foreign to the concepts of Western logic.

**Pratiyogi:** All relations (sambandha) in Nyäya are conceived as subsisting between two terms. One of these terms is the adjunct (pratiyogi) of the relation, the other is the subjunct (anuyogi). Wherever the relation is such that one term  
may be said to occur in or on the other, i.e., to use the technical Nyäya phrase, in all occurrence-exacting (vrtti niyämaka) relations, it is the superstratum (unless this is an absence) that is termed the adjunct of the relation and the  
substratum that is termed the subjunct. The relations H and P are always occurrence-exacting. Contact is sometimes occurrence-exacting, but sometimes not, as for example the contact between the two hands held vertically palms  
together.  

In non occurrence-exacting cases of contact and in all relations which are never occurrence-exacting (e.g., the relation father of), it is the qualificand that is termed the adjunct of the relation and the qualifier that is termed the subjunct. Thus, if I say "my right hand is in contact with my left," my righthand is the adjunct. If I say "Devadatta is related to Indradatta by the relationfather of (sva-sunutä-sambandha). Devadatta is the adjunct. Notice that in many cases 'adjunct' and 'superstratum' may both be used to refer to the same entity in the same knowledge, as to pot in 'the ground possess  
(es) a pot'. Yet the concept of an adjunct is quite different from the concept of a superstratum. An adjunct is an adjunct of a relation. A superstratum is a substratum.

**Samyoga:** Contact is considered to be a quality, that is, a member of the second category.Like other qualities, contact inheres in substances, but unlike most qualities,it inheres in pairs rather than in single individuals. For example, when fireis in contact with a mountain, contact inheres in fire and mountain. Contact is an occurrence-exacting relation of incomplete occurrence. It is transient, for we see it destroyed before the destruction of the entities it connects.

# **Pratyabhijnáana:** is a branch of Kashmir Saivism Etymologically, *Pratyabhijna* is formed from *prati* - "something once known, now appearing as forgotten", *abhi* - "immediate" and *jna* - "to know". So, the meaning is direct knowledge of one's self, recognition.

# I donot know how it can be used to calibrate an instrument 

# Eigenvalues: Pleas see

<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvalues_and_eigenvectors>

Eigen Fuction **Please see**  

<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenfunction>

Now it is left to Scholars to decide if there is anything common between "Avacchedaka frequencies" a term not defined, Eigen values and Eigen functions.

" But when Indian knowledge is concerned it is the case of "always already given discourse". Nothing new to be found. Brahman already found."

Indian Knowledge or no philosophy is give as a discourse it thought using sound methods of Grammar and Logic.  

"Nothing new to be found. Brahman already found."  
  

It is easy to trivialise and brush aside a great system of thought. If you have something substantiate to contribute i will be very eager to learn
