hariH OM,  
  

 I think this post by vishvas is much ado about nothing. When the rule clearly talks about exceptions, why should he read "racism" etc. in the rule?  
  

 Any group needs to define its boundaries. In doing so, if some people are not allowed, we shouldn't read racist overtones.  
  

svasti,  

 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,
