Please don't complicate the 'FAQ'. The FAQ is a guideline to enable every member to exchange views is a meaningful manner. Please note a Scholar is heard often, for non Scholars and those who seek Knowledge this mailing list can act as one platform to express views.  
  
This is भारतीयविद्वत्परिषत् so as the name suggests, this mailing list is primarily for Indians. Scholars outside India can participate by invitation.
