As such there is no such restriction. Anything under the sun can be discussed if it is related to core subject of the group. Core subject is literature of Sanskrit.

****

**But one should not post anything that is solely aimed at insulting others, are belitteling others, or to unnecessarily negate others. It should be purposeful. If one wants to defeat Dvaita or advaita, shaivism or vaishnavism, then there is no way. Such scholars are advised to go out. We have learnt with great pain what these debates would do to society. Even after milleaniams of direct debates these issues are not solved and there are ample reasons to believe that such issues can not be resolved through this distance discussion mode. Hence they can not be solved and should not be debated in this forum. Offcourse there is no restriction to post them if there is anything extraordinary thing is to be discussed. But since they do not serve any purpose members are not encouraged to post such messages unless it is very important innovation or new thing. **

****

**Simply posting to bvp on whatever a man puts in his blog or website is not acceptable. It is allowed only if it is highly important. If somebody writes on a sloka of Bhagavadgita each a day puts it in blog and informs BVPabout uploading about the each sloka, it is not acceptable. If somebody simply wants to teach others what is that thing or this thing then they should know it is their day.**

****

**Nettiquette:**

It is short enough to be reproduced periodically as a reminder. New subscribers should get it automatically as soon as they are admitted.



1. Post when you have a question; can answer a question posed on the

list; or can clarify, expand, challenge, or forward the argument.



Experience elsewhere indicates that those members who have more time on their hands (for reasons such as retirement, etc.) tend to think that they should contribute a post to the list almost every day. It helps if such members pay particular attention to point 1.



2. Quote only directly relevant portions of previous posts in your

contribution.

Members of this list should stick out to particular attention to point 2.



If the relevant part from an earlier post is quoted first, it creates the necessary context and helps the reader in understanding the new post as well as in deciding if he/she should read it in full.



3. Send scholarly posts, not polemical or pious ones.



4. Engage in scholarly debate, not personal attacks.



5. Use the subject line to indicate the subject of your post. Change

subject lines when you are changing the direction of the conversation.



6. Put your real-life name at the end of your message.

All Members posting should use their real name. They should have their official job titles in the signature. Though they express views in BVP as individuals not as representatives of the organization they work for, their job titles will help us to identify the people and it gives authenticity to them. This will help in future if we want to protest or endorse something that is against or pro Sanskrit. It does not matter whether one is working in a university or unilever in a pathashala or pfizer. It is only to help to identify them.   
  



7) Do not "top post" (Most important )  
To know about top posting refer[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posting_style#Top-posting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posting_style#Top-posting)  
  

8) Do not copy past HTML contents as such and do not send message in HTML format  
  

9) Avoid disclaimers in your signature  
  

10) Refer archives before posting a question (Make sure that your question is not answered previously, before asking the question )  
  

11) Use Unicode Input method and font to enter text in Devanagari





12) It is understandable that some wish to express their debt to a scholar who leaves this world or to congratulate someone who is promoted. Posts in such circumstances should, however, be worded in such a way that they rise above the merely personal detail and become useful to at least some members of the scholarly community. How about honouring the person concerned or the memory of the person concerned by giving a bibliography of his or her writings and a short list of major contributions to the field?







13) On profile pictures it should be either their pictures or it can be blank many members put different pictures and religious symbols. It is not compulsory to have their fotos. Fotos will help us to identify them.  
  
14) When talking on controversial topics it better to use phrase " My Opinion" Or " They can be other "Opinions also". In a debate posting by participating members should be restricted to 1 or 2 posts per thread. Else a thread might become too long and if someone sees the thread in between he may not get the complete picture.  
  

**15) already-running threads from other forums should not be imported to BVP (especially those on topics at most marginally relevant), and the continuance of such threads with massive cross-posting. It would be best if threads on the BVP originate here and remain confined thereafter. Some messages from Rajaram etc. originated in BEF come to BVP. This should not happen.**

  
16. BVP should not be used to justify so called sanskrit baby names



17. BVP should not be used for dictionary query. If one wants translation, he should testify that he has tried all available online dictionaries before resorting to BVP



18. Members should not post source queries without trying to find out on web.. The members should try to google search in Roman and Devanagari both before posting source queries.



19. A topic should be raised that will increase knowledge of members, or will clarify genuine doubts. I don't know how relevant it would be to members or scholars, question such as what is the Sanskrit word for butterfly, flyover etc.  
  
20. Questions can be framed either in Sanskrit or English but they need to be clear. A line about the context from which the doubt arose, if added to the question will give members more material to give clear answers.  
  
21. When members need to know about the availability of a book the books complete title and author or subject matter of the book must be given. Please check online libraries such as DLI, archives etc should be searched before asking BVP. In several cases books are available on online libraries for a free download.



**22. members are particularly encouraged to post on new arrivals, reviews, seminars, workshops, job advertisements that are in the interest of all members.**
