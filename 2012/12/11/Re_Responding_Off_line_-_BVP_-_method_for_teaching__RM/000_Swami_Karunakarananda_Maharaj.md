Respected Scholars,  
Thanks for your various opinions on whether Nyaya Shastra could be taught without using their technical terms.  
Taking Sri Ajit's point that it is not possible without using those terms, then the solution in that case would be making the student to work on those various terms and Niyamas that are peculiar to that discipline, giving plenty of examples ofcourse. When he could understand and hold a sufficient grip on what is that and how to use himself independently, then to go in for lengthy lakshanas and parishkaras. I understand by this that his foundation should be made strong slowly.  
  
When I read the reply of Sri Venkatakrishna Shastri, it flashed to me as a challenging and new approach. Why can't we adopt the methods of Vishnu Sharma of Panchatantra and Lewis Carroll of Alice in Wonderland and looking through the glass( presentation of formal logic in an imaginary way) in presenting this Nyaya in a more palatable way? A real genius is required to do that, I think! If somebody works on them, that would be really great contribution in teaching methods. It would make the subject more appealing to larger section of mediocre intelligence.
