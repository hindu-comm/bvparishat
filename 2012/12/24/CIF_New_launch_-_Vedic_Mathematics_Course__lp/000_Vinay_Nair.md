Hari Om Blessed Self,

  

Greetings from Chinmaya International Foundation!

  

Pujya Gurudev Swami Chinmayananda ji envisaged CIF as the bridge between the East and West, science and spirituality, past and present & pundit and public. Walking on His treaded path, and following His dream, CIF is now happy to announce the launch of a new Home Study Course.

  

CIF brings forth the interesting & ancient knowledge system of Vedic Mathematics in the Vedic Mathematics Course.

  

The Course has been launched by Pujya Guruji Swami Tejomayananda on the 21st of Dec.

  

Please go through the flyer. Click on it and you'll be redirected to the Course website.

  

Thank you for your precious time!
