Respected scholars Sir,

I have been managing 'Maharshi Dayanand Gosamwardhan Kendra' at Delhi. We currently have a strength of about 700 cows. We are also associated with many other Goshalas in this area.

A question often asked is about last rites of a cow. As per tradition it is said that a dead cow after removal of the skin was buried and after full decomposition 'Samadi Khad' was obtained. Vrikshayurved mentions the great significance and applications of compost of cow. But no details about making this compost are available.

We are looking for guidance from Vaidic Shastras about procedures if they can found.

It is requested that Vedic scholars may please help us in this respect.
