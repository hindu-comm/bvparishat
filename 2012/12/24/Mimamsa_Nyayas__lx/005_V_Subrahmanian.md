Respected scholars,  
  
As per my understanding there are several nyAya-s that have been 'devised' in the pUrvamImAmsA shAstra that have also been used selectively in Vedanta. One such is the 'apaccheda nyAya' which has been discussed in the Advaita siddhi literature as a result of an objection by the nyAyAmRta of Sri VyAsa Tirtha. This nyAya was originally used by the Brahmasiddhi apparently and cited by the BhAmati in order to show that the 'later-occurring VedAnta pramANa negates the earlier-occurring pratyakShapramANa'. The 'apaccheda' nyAya occurs in the context of a particular ritual where a praayashchitta for a lapse in the ritual by different participants is decided on the order of their occurrence.  
  
Dr.Maheswaran Namboothiri, currently teaching Vedanta in the Sanskrit College, Mylapore, Chennai, did a thesis on the topic of 'mImAmsA nyAya-s used in the BhaamatI prasthAna' guided by the eminent scholar Vidwan Swaminathan Sharma of Tirupati.  
  
If I get more particulars on the topic I shall present the same here.  
  
Apart from श्रीमाधवप्रणीतोजैमिनीय-न्यायमाला-विस्तरः, there is a work of Sri Vidyaranya titled: वैयासिकन्यायमाला which is actually a condensation of each adhikaraNa of the Vedantasutra/bhAshya in one or two verses. It gives the samshaya, pUrvapaksha, his hetu, the siddhanta along with its hetu in a concise manner. One can find these shlokas inserted at the beginning of every adhikaraNa of the Brahmasutra shAnkara Bhashya along with Ratnaprabha, bhAmati, nyAyanirNaya published by Motilal Banarsidas.
