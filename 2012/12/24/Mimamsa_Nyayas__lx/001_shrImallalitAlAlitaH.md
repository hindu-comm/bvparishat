I know only mImAMsA-sUtra-s or adhikaraNa-s as nyAya. They are available easily. I don't know any other nyAya or any book on them.  
If possible make your stand more clear. Have you seen any mImAMsA-nyAya used by any one which is not a part of mImAMsA-sUtra-s or their bhAShya-s or not implied by them ?
