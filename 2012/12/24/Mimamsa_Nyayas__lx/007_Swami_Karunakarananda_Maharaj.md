Respected Scholars,  

Thanks for Sri Ajitji for uploading Dr. P.V.Kane's Mimamsa Nyayas. They are in Sanskrit original with explanations for a few only. Is there any such book (phd thesis or collection type) on all Mimamsa Nyayas like बर्हिन्याय, विश्वजिन्न्यायetc with only simple explanations without polemics. For example here in the attachment I have uploaded one such description of a book called 'Mimamsa Rules of Interpretation' by Sri
K.L. Sarkar with an introduction of Justice Markandeya Katju- a series of lectures on Mimamsa rules. In the lectures five, six and seven there contain such maxims, described. I don't know whether it contains all the maxims described in Mimamsa Shastra there. Has anyone studied that book? I am searching such kind of work in Sanskrit or English.
