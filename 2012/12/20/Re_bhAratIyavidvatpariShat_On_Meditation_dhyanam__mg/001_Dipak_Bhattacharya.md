*dhyāna* is a noun from the root √*dhyai*,** meaning ‘to think of’
‘to meditate upon’both transitive and intransitive. One of the earliest occurrences is in the well-known Gāyatrī mantra

तत् स॑वि॒तुर्वरे॑ण्यं॒ भर्गो॑ दे॒वस्य॑ **धीमहि ।** धियो॒ यो नः॑ प्रचो॒दया॑त्।

For deep thought the earlier verb is √*man*.

See Maitrāyaṇī-Saṃhitā 2.9.1 for the usage of √*dhyai* .
