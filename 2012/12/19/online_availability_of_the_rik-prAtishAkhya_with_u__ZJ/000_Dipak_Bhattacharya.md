Dear Colleagues,

I tried in the Internet but could not ascertain if the Rigveda-Prātiśākhya with Uvaṭa’s commentary and Yāska’s Nirukta with Durgācārya’s commentary are available online. Could anyone inform?

Lakshman Sarup’s Introduction is available, perhaps uploaded by Dr. Ajit Gargeshwari

Best
