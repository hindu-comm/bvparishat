Dear learned colleagues,

I profusely thank you for your collegial feeling and friendliness.This is what keeps us together at the BVP. I am trying to download but it may take time, even hours or days. I require only the 2nd and third chapters of the Nirukta. The remaining are intact with me. I lost Uva.ta a few years ago and none could supply me with one.

Hope the deficiency will go. Thanks again!

Best

DB
