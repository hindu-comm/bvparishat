Respected scholars,

Interpreting our Shastras literally has led to many manydistortions.

Dadhyanch Rishi episode is meant to convey the message as given in RV1.117.2, that a teacher has to come down the mental level of his students to reach the mental level of his students. Here Dadhyanch 
adopts in his head the mental level of a horse/ donkey to be able to reach the level of uneducated students who are likened to have a head of a donkey.

Drawing historical conclusions based on such speculative means isfraughtwith grave dangers. Howeverarchaeologicallyit has been now established that Indians had the first race horse tradition.
