Dear Dr. D. Bhattacarya and other respected scholars,

here is information



Book: The Indo Aryan Controversy

Editors Edwin F. Bryant and Laurie Patton

Paper: The Cultural Counterparts to Proto-Indo-European, Proto-Uralic and Proto Aryan. Authors: Asko Parpola and Christian Carpelan.

Page115

The Vedic tradition (see second paragraph-Shatapatha---) seems to have a predecessor in the mid-Volga region in the beginning of the second millennium BC:

a grave belonging to the Potapovka culture which succeeded the Abashevo culture and possessed horse drawn chariot, was found to contain a skeleton which was otherwise human except for the skull which belonged to a horse.



The Shatapatha Brahmana relates a myth in which Ashvins learn the secret, ‘knowledge of madhu’ which enables its possessor to revive a dead person. They learnt it from the demon Dadhyanc, whom the god Indra had forbidden to reveal the secret to anyone, threatening to cutoff the head of the offender. The Ashvins however promised to revive Dadhyanc after he had taught them the secret, and replaced the head of their teacher with the head of a horse. When Indra cut Dadhyanc’s horse head, the Ashvins replaced it with the original one and revived him.



In the same paper there is a figure of aristocratic burial at Sintashta in southern Urals (2200-1800 BC). It is three level burial. On the top level are two horses. On the next level below is charioteer and on the lowest level was buried the warrior in his chariot with solid wheels.



I am not concerned if horses were brought to the subcontinent by traders from ancient Afghanistan. India always had fleet of formidable war elephants. In my opinion Kurus could not conquer subcontinent because of Jarasandha of Magadha. It is Krishna who got Jarasandha killed because of enmity. He had to run away from his own relativeJarasandha and relate himself to Pandavas.





In the known history power rose again from Magadha -Chandragupta Mourya. Rigveda belongs to Kubhaa to Gangaa. Then there were kingdoms east of Gangaa river and in the whole south India. India’s trade was going on with the middle-east countries even before 3000 BC.





We never raise a question that who was in Afghanistan, Iran or Central Asia when Mahabharata war was fought near the ancient Hastinapura (Delhi region).



This paper also tells us that the Abashevo culture was dominated by Aryans belonging to the Indo-Aryan branch.





It looks to me (I may be wrong-I may be corrected) except the epic Mahabharata there is no mention of capitals Hastinapura and Indraprashtha in the earlier Vedic texts. There is mention of Aasadivant-capital of Janamejaya. Political history of India by H. Raychoudhuri is full of details.



Please present here if you have information contrary to what I stated above. My aim is research so that we grow in our correct knowledge. Please pardon me for a long posting. Thanks. N. R. Joshi.

Dear Dr. Joshi,  
I have no idea about the burial outside India with a horse head. Could you kindly add some detail -- age, location, excavation history, publications etc?
