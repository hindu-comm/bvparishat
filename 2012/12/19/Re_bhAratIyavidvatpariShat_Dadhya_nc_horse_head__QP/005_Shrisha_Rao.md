\> In my opinion Kurus could not conquer subcontinent because of Jarasandha of Magadha.  
  

What is the textual (or other) basis for this opinion?  

  
\> It is Krishna who got Jarasandha killed because of enmity. He had to run away from his own relativeJarasandha and relate himself to Pandavas.  
  

That requires acceptance of a strange principle, whence someone (e.g., Krishna) must consider one's maternal uncle's father-in-law (e.g., Jarasandha) as a relative, more so than first cousins (e.g., Pandavas). Many people would have difficulty with this premise -- first cousins are often close, sometimes almost like siblings, while an uncle's father-in-law could well be a perfect stranger.
