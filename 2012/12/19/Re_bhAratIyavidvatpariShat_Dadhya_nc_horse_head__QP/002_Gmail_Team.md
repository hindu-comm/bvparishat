Dear Subodha Kumar, I enjoy your postings. You said you are engineer. Interpreting ancient texts is always problematic. If I say you interpretation is as good as my interpretation. what will you say? You know that on this list there are great Sanskrit scholars who proudly present that Sanskrit is polysemous language-one Dhaatu may have many meanings. So we can pull out any meaning using any symbolism that we wish. How do you make sense of the names Divodas, Sudas, Kavi Caayamaana, Abhyaavarti Caayamaana, Trasadasyu, Purukutsa, from Rigveda? Are not these names of people? Are you going to attach some unknown spiritual meanings to them ? Thanks. N.R.Joshi

Respected scholars,

Interpreting our Shastras literally has led to many manydistortions.

Dadhyanch Rishi episode is meant to convey the message as given in RV1.117.2, that a teacher has to come down the mental level of his students to reach the mental level of his students. Here Dadhyanch 
adopts in his head the mental level of a horse/ donkey to be able to reach the level of uneducated students who are likened to have a head of a donkey.

Drawing historical conclusions based on such speculative means isfraughtwith grave dangers. Howeverarchaeologicallyit has been now established that Indians had the first race horse tradition.
