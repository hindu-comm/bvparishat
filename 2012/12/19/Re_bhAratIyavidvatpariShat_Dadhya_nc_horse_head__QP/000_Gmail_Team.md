Dear Dr. Ajit Gargeshwari,



Thanks for the reference. The point I was trying to make that burial with man's body with cut horse head is found outside of the subcontinent in central Asia. In the say way bronze plate depiction of horse head Ashvini kumaras making Cyavan Rishi young is found in the present Iran (Luristan Bronzes) in Luiristan area, not in the subcontinent. How do youexplainit? Do you have any such evidence from Harappan archeology? Thanks. N.R.Joshi.

The importance of the *horse head* as a symbol of the Asvins and their role as rescuers and helpers is apparent from the Vedic texts. There have been several interesting contribution on this legend.
