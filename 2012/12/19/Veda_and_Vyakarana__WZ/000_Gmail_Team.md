Thanks Dr. D. Bhattacharya for expressing frank opinion on Oldenberg.



We learn from your postings. You mentioned two Atharvedas-one is Pippalada Samhita. I read that Pippalada was son of Dadhici. Pippalada created fire to take revenge on Indra who used bones of Dadhici to make Vajra to kill Vritra. Dadhyanc-horse head (Rigveda) found in Central Asia in burial -body with horse head. You might have read about it. Any thoughts on that? N.R.Joshi

Dear Dr. Joshi,

Thanks! I relent the long deliberation that follows but since my stand has been questioned it has to be defended.

What you say is correct. But that was for understanding the Vedas. Patañjali enumerates the necessities of studying Vyākaraṇa twice, once as रक्षोहागमलघ्वसन्देहाःप्रयोजनम्।This concerns understanding and explaining the Vedas. The other necessities are deductive utterances partly Vedic, partly laukika. Nowhere does he advise examining the correctness of the Vedas.
