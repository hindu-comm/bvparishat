Dear scholars, the samkhya doctrine of sattva, rajas, tamas was adopted by the works on medicine. It is available in general public in the form of the colour: while, red and black and independently available in biochemicals: calcareas, natrums and Kalis.  
My question is: In Sanskrit texts of any field including medicine or system of philosophy, is there any doctrine for the movement and their direction. e.g. white to black or black to red etc. If the principle is available it may be very useful for the administration of medicine particularly for Ayurveda. The principle if available can do a good benefit to the patients and useful for human beings including the birds and beast and the trees for therapy. Regards, spnarang
