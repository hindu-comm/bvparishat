Sir,  
  
There is a famous 'ashvamedha yAga' in our Veda. The 5th and the 7th kAnDa of the Yajurveda samhita mention this yAga. Scholars may pl. identify these  
parts and help us understand how exactly this yAga is performed. This yaga is famed by many noted persons having performed it:  
  
Is there a description of this yAga in the Valmiki Ramayana where Rama commences this yAga and even Dasharatha performs it in the bAlakANDa?  
  
In fact the Mahabharata itself mentions about this yAga:  
  

<http://www.yogamag.net/archives/2007/bfeb07/vedic.shtml>  
//The epic Mahabharata is replete with examples testifying that yajna was an indispensable activity for kings and emperors. In the Shanti Parva, there are numerous stories of ashvamedha yajna being performed by virtuous kings and emperors. Dushyanta, son of Bharata, completed 100 ashvamedha yajnas, Bhagiratha performed several more, and King Dilip completed 1000 such rituals of fire. King Yudhishthira too conducted an ashvamedha yajna.//

This site also mentions the ashwamedha yaga in the Shanti parva of the Mahabharata.  
  
Scholars may pl. help us know more about this ashwamedha yAga. The 'how' of it is most important. On the internet I could find this:  
  
<http://bachodi.wordpress.com/2010/07/26/ashvamedha-yaga/> I am not saying that this site is 'authentic' but this is perhaps the best explanation of the  
method of the yaga I could find upon a search.  
  

// The Ashvamedha could only be conducted by a king ( rājā ). Its object was the acquisition of power and glory, the sovereignty over neighbouring provinces, and general prosperity of the kingdom.

… The horse is sprinkled with water, and the Adhvaryu and the sacrificer whisper mantras into its ear. Anyone who should stop the horse is ritually cursed, and a dog is killed symbolic of the punishment for the sinners. The horse is then set loose towards the North-East, to roam around wherever it chooses, for the period of one year (or half a year, according to some commentators). …. If the horse wanders into neighbouring provinces hostile to the sacrificer, they must be subjugated. The wandering horse is attended by a hundred young men, sons of princes or high court officials, charged with guarding the horse from all dangers and inconvenience.

… the horse, a hornless he- goat , a wild ox ( go-mrga , Bos gavaeus ) are bound to sacrificial stakes near the fire, and seventeen other animals are attached to the horse. A great number of animals, both tame and wild, are tied to other stakes, …

…Then the horse is slaughtered …

… The horse is dissected, and its flesh roasted. Various parts are offered to a host of deities and personified concepts with utterances of svaha “all-hail…//
