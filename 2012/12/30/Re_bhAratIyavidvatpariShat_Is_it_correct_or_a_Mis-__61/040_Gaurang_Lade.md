Respected scholars,

  

To understand what meant of "Bali" in yagna, one have to understand culture were present during Veda period means 5000yrs before.

  

Rishis mentioned in Veda about "aahuti" of horse , cow in yagna to praise god, now if we think they to kill horse to praise god then that they should have got "gou-Hatya" paap.

  

Now in reality fact that time they use to take part of nail, or hair from animal to present it as "Bali" or sacrifice of that animal.

  

Today we have tradition to provide our hair at lord venkatesh., that does not meant we sacrifice our entire body to god.

  

  

But scientifically looking our rishis know that any part of body cell have DNA of person or animal that part represent. And to say god that they sacrifice animal they use to cut hair or nail of animal as representation .

  

Please think above explanation in detail , compare how we can write sacrifice as a part of communication to other person then only we can understand what our rishis actually meant to say for sacrifice.

  

Also "Aja" word in Sanskrit many are interpreting as beef or something else but if we go at interior part rural India , "Aja" actually meant raw rice seeds without polished.

  

Thanks,

  

Glade
