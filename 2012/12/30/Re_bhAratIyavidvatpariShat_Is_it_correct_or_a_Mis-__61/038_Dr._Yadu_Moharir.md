Namaste:  
  
I am bit puzzled with Dr Gargeshwari's remarks.  
  
My generic question to all the scholars on this list are:  
  
a. Is there an issue ?  
b. Are we willing to admit the problem?  
c. Who should shoulder the responsibility for making appropriate corrections.  
d. Not addressing the issue is just like hiding the pregnancy. OR  
  
Is the issue that we know we are pregnant but we do not want to be told that that we are pregnant.  
  
Best Rgds
