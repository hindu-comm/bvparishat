Dear Scholars,

  

The topic in question was raised on the reference in Apastramba

  

Aapastambha Gruhyastra; 3 Khanda -6 sutra; Vivahe Gowh10-Etaavadgoraalambhasthanam atidhih pitaro vivahasch

and not meat eating in general or cow slaughter or गोमांसभक्षण is a general practice or not.

  

I don't it need be pulled out or dragged into vegetarianism or non-vegetarianism today found in our society nor any movement such as world wide vegetarian congress or so we are popularly know through net work.

  

This aspect had already been discussed in an earlier thread in our group:

  

<https://groups.google.com/d/topic/bvparishat/sCg5ZqnBi0M/discussion>  

  

Mr. Narasing Rao has quoted the relevant commentaries on the above portion and there is little doubt about it. Centuries old discussion was held by Vishvanatha Nyaya Pancanana on this point of meat eating as mentioned in a message:  

  

<https://groups.google.com/d/msg/bvparishat/sCg5ZqnBi0M/3QfV9kIU5OgJ>  

  

One can refer to the book and pass their comments. It may be interesting whether the killing of animals is a "himsa" or not which is a deviation from the point raised. Atithiyajna is one of the five yajna-s of a गृहस्थ and the above reference of Apastamba is to be taken in this point of view and not as a general practice or not. An example of Vishvanatha's argument can be cited for sample:

  

There is a rite prescribed श्येनयाग for destroying the enemy's life as आभिचारकर्म. The killing of श्येन is not considered as हिंसा as it is prescribed by the श्रुति and it is exempted from हिंसा as prohibited by
मा हिंस्या सर्वा भूतानि which is not special for any animal, not only cow in any case. Now, the result of such आभिचार costing the life of another fellow human being is certainly against the ordainment, which is certainly हिंसा. Hence it is not advisable and against the श्रुति and will result in accruing resultant पाप or अधर्म.

  

Again, if a king uses this as a weapon against his enemy, it comes within his राजधर्म by all means to eliminate the enemies and not meant for an ordinary man to revenge somebody.

  

And again, if one comes to kill you, you have no other way to escape, and if you murder him it is considered as justifiable:

  

आततायिनमायान्तं हन्यादेवाविचारयन्

नाततायिवधे दोषो हन्तुर्भवति कश्चन॥- मनु० ( ८ \| ३५०-३५१ )

  

It is not for eating meat of human being.
