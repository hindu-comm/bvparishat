Dear Sirs,

  

I completely agree with Prof. R N Iyengar in this regard and Dr. Narsing Rao and the others with him in this thread are not for anyavocationand it is just pure satyaanvEShaNaM based on hard facts. Those who are so weak and mean as not even to see these discussions with a sense of scholarly detachment are not fit to be called as vidvaan-s in the primary sense.

  

  

regards

  

ganesh
