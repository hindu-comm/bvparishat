The interpretation is correct. Here are the relevant sutras:  
  
AGS 3.10 एतावद्गोरालम्भनमतिथिः पितरो विवाहश्च  
  
These are the occasions for the sacrifice (आलम्भनम्) of a cow (गोः) - (the  
arrival of) a guest, (offerings to the) ancestors, and a wedding.  
  
AGS 13.15 गौरिति गां प्राह  
  
(The host) announces the cow saying "the cow"  
  
AGS 13.17 यद्युत्सृजेदुपांशूत्तरां जपित्वोमुत्सृजतेत्युच्चैः  
If (the guest) wishes to let loose the cow, he should mutter the next in  
a low voice (उपांशु) and say loudly (उच्चैः) "Om let it loose" (ॐ उत्सृजत)  
  
Note: "Next" refers to the next mantra in the Mantrapatha (AKA  
Ekagnikanda). In this case it would be: पिबतूदकं तृणाण्यत्तु (May it drink  
water and eat grass).  
  
AGS 13.18 अन्नं प्रोक्तमुपांशूत्तरैरभिमन्त्र्य ॐ कल्पयतेत्युच्चैः  
(Otherwise) he should mutter the next over the announced meal and say  
loudly "Om prepare it" (ॐ कल्पयत)  
  
Note: "Next" refers to: सा विराट् तन्मा क्षायि तस्य तेऽशीय तन्म ऊर्जंधाः ।  
  
There is no doubt that the Vedic people sacrificed bulls/cows and also  
ate beef. Please see the attached document for more details. However,  
that does not mean that we should do the same. Doing something just  
because some ancient people did it is silly.  
  
This may be embarrassing to some; but scholars should accept the truth  
and not live in denial.
