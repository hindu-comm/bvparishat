\> There is no doubt that the Vedic people sacrificed bulls/cows and also ate beef. Please see the attached document for more details.  
  

There are a number of points in that document (and otherwise in such literature) which beg for closer inquiry, e.g., the claim that a guest is designated as a "cow-killer." This point has been discussed before here; see <https://groups.google.com/group/bvparishat/browse_thread/thread/ce9039396d2701f5/> for more.
