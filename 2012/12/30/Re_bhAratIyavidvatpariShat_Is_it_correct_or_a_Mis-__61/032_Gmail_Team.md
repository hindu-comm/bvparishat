Dear Sati Shankar,



There is no limit tointerpret esoteric meanings behind almost all religious books of the ancient India. They say there are seven layers of meanings in Vedas. How many layers one hope to understand in one life time? There is hermeneutic (pardon for spelling if wrong) etymology and linguistic etymology. There was discussion in ancient India about VarNavaada and Sphotavaada. Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
