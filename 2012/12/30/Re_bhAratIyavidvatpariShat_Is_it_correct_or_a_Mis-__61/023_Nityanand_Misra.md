Completely agree with the comments of Dr. Rao on the writing of D N Jha. I have not read *Holy Cow: Beef in Indian Dietary Traditions* but I have read parts of its republication *The Myth of the Holy Cow* (ISBN 9781859846766, published by Verso in the UK and the USA). The text is poorly presented, the copy-editing is far from professional, the analytical logic conspicuous by its absence. Have a look at this from page 37 of the book:

The Myth of the Holy Cow

Whether or not the Vedic Aryans ate consecrated or sacrificed beef or other animal flesh, the heart of the matter is that the milch cattle including the cow was not sacred during the Vedic and post-Vedic centuries. The term *aghnya/aghnyā* (lit. not to be slain) has been used at four places in the *Ṛgveda* and the *Atharvaveda* 'as a masculine noun equivalent to bull or ox and 42 times with a feminine ending to mean a cow'.¹⁰⁸ Attention has also been drawn to the use of words for cow as epithet or in simile and metaphor with reference to entities of highest religious significance,¹⁰⁹ though these occurrences do not indicate their primary sense with reference to the actual animal. Neither of the two types of evidence adduced in favour of the sacredness of the Vedic cow, therefore, points to the basically unslayable character of cows. On the contrary the references seem to emphasize their economic value.¹¹⁰ When slaughtered they provided food ...

This is the start of a section. I read the paragraph several times over to see if I missed something between the two pieces of evidence he is trying to refute and the word "therefore" which precedes his conclusion. The deductive process beat my twelve years of training in logic, statistics and econometrics. The author brings up two claims he wishes to refute, then makes a random statement about primary sense without offering any reason or proof, and abracadabra here we have a conclusion of the hypoethesis!! No linguistic analysis, no quoting of Yaska, no Paninian analysis, no analysis of commentaries, no context or elaboration of the 46 occurrences of the words aghnya/aghnyā, no logical reasoning and you have a conclusion. Maybe the reasoning is from some other author(s) buried in the footnotes, maybe it is the editor's slip, but I expect something more professional. This is all the more surprising since prima facie, to most grammarians, the word aghnya just means what Dr. Jha is trying to deny - unslayable/not to be slain. One would expect a good 3-4 page treatment to counter this evidence, I did not see it.  
  
This is just one example, the book abounds in similar leaps of faith disguised as logic which led me to conclude that this is not a piece of historical research where evidence is analyzed to reach a conclusion but an exercise in polemic where one starts with the conclusion and builds up evidence to support the conclusion. The author concludes that only cows offered as a Dakshina to a Brahmin were unslayable, a conclusion which is a guess or belief at best, not a matter of fact as reported by glowing reviews of the book in The Hindu, New York Times and Guardians (the usual suspects, *playing to the gallery*, anyone?). Dr. Rao has already pointed out that he has skipped tomes of evidence from Itihasa, Puranas, et cetera which are much older than when Dr. Jha thinks Hindus started attaching sacredness to the cow.  
  
Dr. Jha may be an eminent historian, which I am definitely not. He may be well versed in Vedas, grammar and Sanskrit, where I am a beginner at best. I am only a logical reader trying to analyze "analytical reasoning process" of his works, and with all my experience in hypothesis testing, I find it lacking in scientific rigour. We have a genre for science-fiction (sci-fi), but we need a new genre called "historical fiction" (hi-fi) to categorize these pseudo-scientific works.
