I am a vegetarian by birth and choice and I remain to be be so. In  
spite of this I cannot afford to distort or deny the fact that in our  
vedic culture we do find the references to non-vegetarianism. Coming  
to RaamaayaNa under discussion, here are a few references from the  
edition of the well knwn Vedaanta-vyaakraNa-alaMkaara vidvaan  
mahaamahOpaadyaaya N. Ranganaatha Sharmaa:  
  
raama's word to lakShmaNa:  
  
mRugaM hatvaa aanaya kShipraM...........(ayOdhyaakaaNDa 56-23)  
  
aiNEyaM shrapayasvaitat.......................  
  
  
maaMsaani ca sumRShTaani phalaani vividhaani ca  
raamasyaabhyavahaaraarthaM kiMkaraastUrNamaaharan (uttarakaaNDa 42-19,20)  
  
There are few more. But due to my back pain i am unable to search now  
it self and so here is a rather small information.  
  
  
regards
