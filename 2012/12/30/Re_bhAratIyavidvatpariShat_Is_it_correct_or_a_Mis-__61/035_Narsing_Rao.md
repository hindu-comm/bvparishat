Not sure what your problem is. Are you suggesting that  

-   Certain topics should not be discussed because they hurt the
    religious sentiments of some, and that  
-   People who feel offended by opinions expressed by others can take
    them (or even the moderators) to court?

If so, I disagree and also think that this is a dangerous precedent.
The whole point of a scholarly discussion is that ideas (backed by citations and/or evidence) are discussed even if there is disagreement.  
  
Also, the term "Bharatiya", as I understand it refers to Indian, without the connotation of any particular religion or sect.
