Here are my comments on the page you have attached part of which is reproduced below:

First, his claim that references to the offerings of animal flesh are a later interpolation into the Purvamimamsa are unsubstantiated.  
  
Secondly, his quote of 12.2.2 is incomplete and also out of context.  
  
Here, the context is the गार्हपत्याद्यग्निषु लौकिककर्मानुष्ठानाधिकरणम् which address the objection that shrauta fires can also be used for laukika acts (such as cooking, heating, burning, lighting and so on).  
  
12.2.1 विहारो लौकिकानामर्थं साधयेत्प्रभुत्वात् ।  
  
Purvapaksha - The विहार (meaning गार्हपत्य and other fires) can also be used to accomplish लौकिक acts, because of their capacity for doing so (प्रभुत्वात्).  
  
12.2.2 मांसपाकप्रतिषेधश्च तद्वत्  
  
Purvapaksha continued: Because cooking of flesh (for लौकिक purposes) is prohibited, but not other activities.  
  
Here is the Shabara bhashya on this sutra:  
  
मांसपाकप्रतिषेधो भवति तद्वत् । यद्वन्न्यायोपदिष्टः । मांसं न पचेयुस्तस्मिन्नग्नौ, यत्पचेयुः क्रव्यादं कुर्युरिति । लौकिके हि पाके मांसप्रसङ्गो न वैदिके , शामित्रे मांसपाकः ।  
  
The resolution is in the next sutra:  
  
12.2.3 निर्देशाद्वा वैदिकानां स्यात्  
  
By being ordained as such, these fires can be used only for Vaidika acts. (i.e. not for Laukika acts)  
  
I am attaching the translation in English of the Shabara bhasya on this adhikarana by Ganganath Jha.  
  
In fact references to animal sacrifices are so numerous in the Purva Mimamsa that I don't see how is is possible to deny them.  
  
The excellent reference provided by Prof. Shrisha Rao can be read in its entirety online and provides numerous reference to animal sacrifices:

    For far better scholarship on this subject, I would much rather recommend the excellent paper "To Kill or Not to Kill the Sacrificial Animal (Yajna Pasu)" by Jan E.M. Houben, in an anthology titled "Violence denied: violence, non-violence and the rationalization of violence in South Asian cultural history" -- see http://books.google.co.in/books?id=6znfIA3UfWcC&lpg=PA105 for the same.  The paper is from page 105 onwards.  Houben does a creditable job, and looks at a much larger portion of the literature on this topic, from primary प्रस्थान-त्रय sources to Vedantic commentators.

    Regards,

    Shrisha Rao
