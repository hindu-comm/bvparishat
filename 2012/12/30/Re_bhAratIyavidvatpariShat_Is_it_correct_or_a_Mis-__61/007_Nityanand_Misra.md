Posters are requested to back such bizarre and controversial claims with appropriate citation from a reliable source. "Said to contain" is a misleading statement - by whom? Where? Which publication?

This has nothing to do with consumption of beef or with Srirama's diet in forest. Also, this is a highly irresponsible citation made without understanding of the context of the original text. The whole chapter 168 in Agni Purana describes महापातकs on consciously or unconsciously eating certain things or performing certain actions and and how to perform प्रायश्चित्त for these महापातक. Right before these verses you quoted, there are verses which explicitly say that a person who commits the महापातक of eating the meat of cow has to perform the तप्तकृच्छ्र व्रत to become pure (Agni Purana, Chapter 168, verses 14 to 16).  
  
शुष्काणि जग्ध्वा मांसानि प्रेतान्नं करकाणि च ॥  
क्रव्यादशूकरोष्ट्राणां गोमायोः कपिकाकयोः ।  
गोनराश्वखरोष्ट्राणां छत्राकं ग्रामकुक्कुटं ॥  
मांसं जग्ध्वा कुञ्जरस्य तप्तकृच्छ्रेण शुद्ध्यति ।  
  
Regarding Verses 19-20, they say that the meat of five-nailed animals - Shashaka (hare), Shallaki (porcupine), Godha (probably iguana), Khadga (rhino), Kurma (tortoise) and certain fishes may be eaten. Seen in the context of the chapter on महापातक, this means that for any reason (consciously, unconsciously, or under compulsion), if one consumes the above, then the person is not impure and there is no व्रत/प्रायश्चित्त to be done. One may refer the 1904 English prose translation of Agni Purana by Manmatha Natha Dutt Shastri (Chowkhamba Sanskrit Series, Varanasi) which has the same interpretation of these verses - the book is available at Digital Library of India (Barcode 4990010112813).  


On a controversial topic like this, members are again requested to post with proper citation. Even though I do not agree with Dr. Narsing Rao, I find his posts well written and supported with reliable citations, and we all need to learn from this.
