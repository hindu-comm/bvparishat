\> 5. So far no reference has been made to Dwijendra Narayan Jha. 2002, Holy Cow: Beef in Indian Dietary Traditions; paperback (2004) ISBN 1-85984-424-3. I have not read this book. It was said to have been banned in India (banning of books is usually not a wise course of action).  
  

I believe Jha made a song and dance about it when the book appeared about a decade ago and gave interviews playing the injured martyr, saying he had been threatened, etc., but I don't believe a formal ban was ever put in place. Even if there were, it should hardly be a bother because the book can be ordered from [amazon.com](http://amazon.com) and other sources.  
  
I have read the book but unfortunately cannot commend the author on his scholarship; not only is his style and approach needlessly offensive and confrontational, but the work is partial, poorly structured, and superficial, and does not at all acknowledge that there is also a tradition whence cows were regarded as sacred (e.g., the Puranic tales of Kamadhenu, Nandini, etc.).  
  
For far better scholarship on this subject, I would much rather recommend the excellent paper "To Kill or Not to Kill the Sacrificial Animal (Yajna Pasu)" by Jan E.M. Houben, in an anthology titled "Violence denied: violence, non-violence and the rationalization of violence in South Asian cultural history" -- see <http://books.google.co.in/books?id=6znfIA3UfWcC&lpg=PA105> for the same. The paper is from page 105 onwards. Houben does a creditable job, and looks at a much larger portion of the literature on this topic, from primary प्रस्थान-त्रय sources to Vedantic commentators.
