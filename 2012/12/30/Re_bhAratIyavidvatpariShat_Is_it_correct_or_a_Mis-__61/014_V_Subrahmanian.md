Sir,  
  
I found this information in a website:  
  
<http://shrigaurbrahmanmahasabhabikaner.webs.com/>  
  
[// Apastamba](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apastamba "Apastamba")(Apastamba Dharmasutra) gives another list of animals not to be eaten. He also mentioned that during[Shraddha](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shraddha "Shraddha")meat should be offered to the ancestors.^([\[6\]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Brahmin_diet#cite_note-tamil-5))//  
  

-   I have heard from a Bengali Brahmin that those meat-eating families
    among them prepare meat during all functions like shrAddha, marriage
    but not during upanayanam. The guests are given a choice to partake
    of vegetarian food too during those functions. -   A Nepali brahmin who is a vidyArthi in Brindavan had come to
    Bangalore for a workshop on Vedanta and Nyaya at the Purnaprajna
    Samshodhana Mandiram. Upon my asking he said: Among Nepali
    brahmins, just like Bengalis, there are meat-eating families.
    Intermarriages are allowed but the girl from a non-meat eating
    brahmin family has to give her consent before she is married into a
    meat-eating brahmin family.  
-   I have heard from elders that the 'uLuttham vaDai / uddina vaDe'
    माषापूपः** served during shrAddham in our Southern people's homes
    is representative of the meat offering during this occasion in olden
    times. 

Could you pl. verify from the Apastamba sUtras the above information of offering meat during shraaddham?
