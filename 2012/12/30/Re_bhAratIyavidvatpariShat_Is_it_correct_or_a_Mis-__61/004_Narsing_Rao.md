This in fact proves that animal sacrifice is ordained by the Vedas. Shankaracharya's explanation that killing animals is not OK in general but permitted in the Yaga is just a way of justifying slaughter of animals (I find this moral stand unacceptable). So we have to convince ourselves that the animal is neither killed nor hurt - see Taittiriya Brahmana 3.7.7 - (Sayana : अथ पशोः संज्ञप्यमानस्य परावृत्तौ मन्त्रमाह) न वा उ एतन्म्रियसे न रिष्यसि ।  
  
Ramanuja in his Sribhashyam offers the explanation: हिरण्यशरीर ऊर्ध्वः स्वर्गलोकमेति.  
  
I can give more references from the Taittiriya Samhita that describe animal sacrifices.  
  
Such views have led to justifiable criticism such as  
  
पशुश्चेन्निहतः स्वर्गं ज्योतिष्टोमे गमिष्यति । स्वपिता यजमानेन तत्र कस्मान्न हिंस्यते ॥ from the Charvakas, and  
यूपं छित्वा पशून् हत्वा कृत्वा रुधिरकर्दमम् । यद्येवं गम्यते स्वर्गं नरके केन गम्यते ॥ from the Jainas (quoted by मल्लिषेण in his स्याद्वादमञ्जरी).  
  
In response to Shri Misra's message I would like to say that it is possible that both views co-existed. Some people opposed the sacrifice of animals whereas others supported it.
