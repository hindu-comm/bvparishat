Dear Prof. Iyengar,

  

First, let me congratulate you on the excellent critique of Prof. B.N. Achar's writing in the area of archaeo-astronomy that you kindlyshared with the BVP membership a few days ago. Although I value Prof. Achar's work, too, I think your review, along with his original essay, should be regularly read in the courses on research methodology that are so commonly offered in Indian universities these days. The emphasis you placed on sound philology should particularly be noted by the younger members of the BVP list.

  

As to the issue with which your remark below and the remarks of some other well-informed scholars who have recently written to the list are concerned, I have the following questions to ask or observations to make:

  

1\. Why is it that beef-eating is talked about only in the context of certain situations and, perhaps, only in reference to certain types of individuals? One implication of this feature of the evidence will be that beef-eating was not common and was not generally recommended / approved of / entertained.

  

2\. The contexts, as far as they have so far been mentioned, provide no hint to the effect that beef was offered because it was thought of as an expensive commodity or as a rare delicacy.

  

3\. If 1 and 2 are valid, how far justified would we be in seeing a historical or chronological development in attitudes toward beef-eating?

  

4\. As has already been observed, the scholars who think that only limited beef-eating existed see an esoteric reason behind the practice; that is, even though they do not know what that reason was, they are willing to believe that it existed. If we view this defensive posture as appearing only in (relatively) later times, we could characterize it as apologetics (and, therefore, worthy of dismissal). However, if the evidence substantiating beef-eating as a practice, whentaken collectively,\*\*indicates that there was only a restricted acceptance of the practice (comparable to alcohol-drinking in Sautraama.nii), the esoteric defence of the practice could be said to have been as old as the practice itself; it would not be a case of modern apologetics somehow trying to get rid of an inconvenient fact. In other words, some kind of view or theory about the interrelationships of wordily entities (objects, human beings, other life forms) must have preceded the practice. We may not know the precise nature of the theory. It may even not be a theory we would accept. But it will be difficult to deny that serious thought preceded the admission of beef-eating in specific situations -- that beef-eating might not have been introduced for the negative reason of curtailing a common practice but for a positive reason of achieving something that other means could not achieve or could not achieve equally well.

  

\*\* In the collectivity of evidence, we should also include passages containing aghnyaa etc. which indicate that a cow was not to be killed and which seem to be at least as old as, if not older than, the passages testifying to the existence of beef-eating.

  

5\. So far no reference has been made to Dwijendra Narayan Jha.2002, Holy Cow: Beef in Indian Dietary Traditions; paperback (2004)[ISBN 1-85984-424-3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:BookSources/1859844243). I have not read this book. It was said to have been banned in India (banning of books is usually not a wise course of action).

  

With warm regards,

  

a.a.
