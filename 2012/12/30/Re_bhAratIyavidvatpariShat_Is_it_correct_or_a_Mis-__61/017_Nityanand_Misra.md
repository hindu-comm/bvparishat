The interpretation of ऐणेयं मांसं as the flesh of a deer in VR 2-56-22 and मृगं as deer in VR 2-56-23 is not beyond debate, and has been contested by many scholars. The biggest problem with this interpretation is that it contradicts several other verses in VR itself, notably VR 2-20-29, VR 2-34-49 and VR 2-54-16. Janakinath Sharma has logically contradicted both interpretations, though he has only briefly delved on this, in the Hindi translation of VR - please see both footnotes in the page attached from Sharma's translation published by Gita Press, Gorakhpur, 1996 (first edition 1960).

Here again, मांसं can mean the fleshy part of the fruit, as in VR 2-56-22 by Sharma. Both meanings of मांसम् (flesh of animal and flesh of a fleshy fruit) are listed in Monier Williams and V S Apte dictionaries.
