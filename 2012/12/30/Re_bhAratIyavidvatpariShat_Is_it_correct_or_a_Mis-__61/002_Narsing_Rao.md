No Sir, it does not mean that. All I am saying is that there is enough evidence that rituals involving the slaughter of cows existed since they are described in many places.  
  
I am attaching the following:  
  

-   Apastamba GS 3.10, 13.15-18 with the commentaries Anakula (by
    Haradatta Misra) and Tatparyadarshana (by Sudarshanacharya).
    Haradatta lived around the 14th CE and Sudarshanacharya a little
    later. Sudarshanacharya in particular is a highly regarded
    commentator. Please read them to remove any doubts about what
    Apastamba meant (unless you want to dismiss them by saying that they
    misinterpreted everything). There is enough detail about the ritual
    (for example - तस्याः संज्ञपनं कृत्वा वपामुत्खिद्य , etc.), and
    Haradatta also quotes the Ashvalayana GS (end of first chapter):
    नामांसो मधुपर्को भवति भवति ॥ -   Shulagava ritual described in the Ashvalayana GS with the commentary
    of Haradatta (see sutras 21 to 25 for gory details). The Shulagava
    is also described by Baudhayana and several others  

Now I cannot say how frequently these rituals were performed. There are innumerable details about animal sacrifices in the Vedic literature -
the Aitareya Brahmana Chapter 33 even gives details about how the parts of the sacrificial animal is divided between the priests (हनू सजिह्वे प्रस्तोतुः , श्येनं वक्ष उद्गातुः , etc.)  
  
What I find more shocking is that some people deny that animal sacrifices are even mentioned in the Vedic literature.  
  
Regards,  
Narsing
