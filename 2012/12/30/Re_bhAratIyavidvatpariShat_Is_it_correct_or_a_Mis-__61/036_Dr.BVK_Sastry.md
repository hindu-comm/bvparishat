Namaste

  

  Certainly this thread of discussion seems to be drifting to unwarranted corners ! On a review of the points deliberated, i notice the following 'clear agenda' in pushing this debate in pre-planned ways ! When the word 'Go / Ashwa ' have multiple meanings in the resource traditional text, why is a preferred meaning being hanged out ? And in terms of generic meat eating, Ayurveda marks specific guidelines. Why shift that debate to Veda related ? These days, Many Ayurveda schools
are very shy to admit to be a part of Original Vedic tradition ! The preference being to go by ' Bottled - Ayurveda encapsulated approach' !

  

 Here below is my notes for making this notes, as a pointer to the ' breakdown in India on the understanding of vedas , which in other words tantamount to misinterpretation'.****

**  
**

**  It is sheer ' klaibya' on the part of many traditional scholars and institutions in not making whole hearted attempt to raise voice in the public and academia to ' kill these misinterpretations, once for all' on a global scale. **

  

** Unless one addresses the ' poorva-paksha / even if it is bad and worse ' formed in the referential document - 'Riddles in Hinduism' , penned by Dr.Ambedkar, available for free study at the url ,
<http://www.ambedkar.org/riddleinhinduism/21A1.Riddles%20in%20Hinduism%20PART%20I.htm#r06>,
these debates can go for 'ages /kalpaanta'. One may also explore -<http://valmikiresearch.com/index.htm?file=main.htm>  .**

**No result will emerge out of these discussions.**

**

  The deliberations on this theme have been there in the name of ' Academic Scholarship '- ever since colonial writings interpreting the vedic traditions and meemaamsaa technicalities. The deliberated data and practices goes to the ' pre-internet / black / stone ages ' before Google, internet, computer !  No scholar seems to pass through this
veil of time and address the question : How to fix the meaning of a Vedic Word , as it was envisaged in a BCE period ! Why Yaska and Panini become referential authority ? Why Karma Kanda approach is important compared to the Acharya -Vedanta Paddhati ? Why Vednaga interpretation anchor is more important than Vedanta -Acharya Paddhati '.

  

  

Here below are the points for contemplation.

  

  

**Point 1:**  This thread of discussion on ' Misinterpretation of Veda' / seems to be slowly trickling to topics like cow slaughter,beef eating, historical ritualism of Ashvamedha with a pointed agenda. This model of agenda driven and ' breast beating' debate has been the hall mark of the combined teams : Colonial interpretations and Politicised Dalit struggle - Anti brahmin movements. The debate starts with the most innocuous topic of veda /vedic ritual, claiming to be an investigation of Truth and real history of Vedic practices. The debate is deliberately pushed to focus on Ashwamedha and Go-medha. The next step is taking the segments of (a) Ashwamedha to point out the obnoxious practices of ' getting the ritual priests engaged with the queens' for getting the royal progeny (b) Go-medha to point out the ' secret meat eating to fulfill the carnal pleasures of vedic brahamanas under the cover of a pitru-yajna' ? This line of argument and debate has gone on ad-nauseain cyber circles . The seeds of ' authority ' for this denigrative interpretation of Vedas and Vedic traditional practices is pointed to the writings of Dr. Ambedkar on Ramayana and Mahabharata. It may not seem politically right to make this pointer; but the refutation needs to be made loud and clear. **How many of theTraditional teams are ready to team up, pool resources and address this issue to save misinterpretation of Vedas / and save their own ' aura a guardians of Vedas' ?**

  

Point 2 : All said and done, the debate of 'Ashwamedha /Go-medha' in the veda /referential documents are dated prior to a BCE period. Given the fact that society is dynamic, and current brahmana / generic hindu society has anchored its current practices to Acharya Paddhati's which are not earlier to 700 C.E, ( assuming a very liberal and conservative upper date for Acharya Shankara establishing the Panchayatana Pooja paddhati and related Mathas for guding veda-Dharma Abhyaasa, how is the current debate going to enrich the ' Knowledge of Vedic traditions, and its history' - ? any way better than what Acharyas established in a span of around 700 years and is a continuing tradition ? 

  

Either we end up saying Acharyas made a wishful, wanton, conscious deviation from earlier authentic vedic tradition to guide the society differently ( which is bad per se !) Or

Acharyas were ignorant of the true vedic tradition, and did not follow the 'poorvaacharya' s' - which is worse.

  

It is a self hurting double edged sword in either approach.

  

**So what is better point to emerge in this deliberation of
'Misinterpretation of Vedas ' : Conceding Acharyas wilful intervention in derailing a tradiiton OR Ignorance of Acharyas of the established traditions ( which seem to be unearthed as a Modern research ? )**

  

**Point 3**: Assuming that the ' old text, interpreted by modern
'Rishi -Scholars (NutanaiH Rishibhih) is really correct, would it still be appropriate to go for the large scale slaughter of Cows /animals for meeting the carnal pleasures , in a civilized society ?

  

  

Mixing up religion and Politicised Societal economics is NEVER a good cocktail.

  

  

 **So the action point question rests in answering in house the questions, ( which demands an answer to the question: What is Veda? What is Samskrutham as the Language of Documents of Veda?' )  : **

  

\(1\) What is the traditional standard to establish the ' RIGHT MEANING OF VEDAS? The Corollary questions being : (a)  What is the RIGHT WAY to PRONOUNCE the VEDA-Akshara, in EACH SHAKHAA (b) WHAT IS THE RIGHT PEDAGOGY of TEACHING VEDA ? 

  

\(2\) Are Traditional schools and community adhering to these standards by referencing to three clear periods : (i) BCE period of Muni's and Rishi's : - where the standard is ' Shadango Vedo Adhyetavyah' . (It is Not Vedaanga ; It is NOT Vedanta ). (ii) The C.E Period of Acharyas from 700 to 1400 CE - up to Sayana Madhava Vidyaranya ( iii) Post 1700 CE till date - colonial period, with ' Nutana-Rishi's and Yogi's ' - 
impacting the working of traditional institutions, ushering in new ' Dharma Shastra Dynamics' ?
