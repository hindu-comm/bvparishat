Respected scholars,

  

I meant to add some of the shlokas that I was instructed to recite and contemplate upon during my personal "snadhyaavandana" practice. These eventually became my staff through the years.  

  

सुलभाः पुरुषा राजन्सततं प्रियवादिनः .  
अप्रियस्य तु पथ्यस्य वक्ता श्रोता च दुर्लभः

and

कामस्तदग्रे समवर्त्तताधि मनसो रेतः प्रथमं यदासीत् ।  

  

Desire in mind is the first step before anything can possibly get manifested. I glad to see that Dr BVK is sincerely looking for collaboration and pooling of resources to progress our understanding.  

  

I sincerely hope that all scholars will help to clarify, purify and preserve our ancient wisdom for future generations.  

  

Best regards,

  

Dr Yadu
