Dear Members,

  

I am happy to announce that the Centre for Ancient History & Culture (CAHC) will be holding an International Seminar on "Future of Civilization". Jain University and Mythic Society, Bangalore are jointly organizing this Seminar. Dr.B.V. Subbarayappa (Renowned for History of Science in India) is the motive force behind this activity. Please see the brochure and encourage the activity by registering for the Seminar.

  

Recently our Centre successfully completed a 3-week National Workshop on Manuscriptology & Paleography (supported by the National Mission) under the leadership of Prof. Wakankar. Several scholars who are also members of BVP were invited as faculty to train the young participants who came from all over India. Dr.Wakankar will post a report in due course.

  

Best regards

  

RN Iyengar
