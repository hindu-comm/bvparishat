hariH OM,  
  
 Will the moderators show that they are capable of the beautiful activity they have entrusted themselves with. viz. "moderation" and spare us of this (pl see inline below) sort of mails?  
  
"Shankacharya’s soul confessed that only 40% of what he wrote was accurate and true."  
  
 I hope the BVP has a better purpose than becoming a lunatic asylum where delusions such as the one above are tolerated.  
  
svasti,  
 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,  

shrivathsa.
