 In response to Katju's comment, I too have a message given in love though he is probably too old to change from what got him where he is.



 A *purusha* should have *paurusha*-- or as Krishna told Arjuna and would have told Katju: *klaibyam maa sma gamah markandeya.* Behave like a MAN and do not go to your grave licking the boots and everything else of that illiterate Gandhi family just because they have given you a small crumb of office.



 If you want to unite India and Pakistan-- go first to your native Kashmir and unite it. It was too much cleverness and not enough manliness that got the likes ofyou kicked out of your homeland that had been won by the likes of Gulab Singh and Zorawer Singh-- not as clever as you are perhaps but *purushas* with *paurusha* and *virya*.



 Having been kicked out, you now want show your bravery by abusing the hosts who are protecting you. If you have any *paurusha* left, please tell Rahul Gandhi what I told you (Quoting the *Gita*)-- stop hiding behind your mothers sari, *klaibyam maa sma gamah raahula.*



** Patronage and position don't elevate a man, it is courage, achievementand conviction. Also, a not very young man like you, like the 43 year old child prodigy Rahul should know-- abuse is no argument, self praise is no recommendation.



 In addition, immaturity is not a sign a precocity especially at your age. Nor is patronage a sign of achievement to be proud of.



 Finally, paraphrasing Edmund Burke-- a big mouth and a small brain go ill together.
