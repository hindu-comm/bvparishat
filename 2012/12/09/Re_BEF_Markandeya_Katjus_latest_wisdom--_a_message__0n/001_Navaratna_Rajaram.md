 Thank you, but I have heard different versions of the story-- that Muslims were willing to come back into the Hindu fold but benarasi Pandit would not allow them. It would be worth knowing the truth.



 Both Kashmiris and Bengalis have suffered from the loss of kshatra and cover it up with arrogant rhetoric. Look at Amartya Sen. Katju sounds like a feeble minded version of Amartya Sen-- more like Rahul Gandhi.



 Incidentally, Manyu is more prominent in the Avesta-- as Agra Manyu. Hopefully, someone can shed light on it.
