Very well said Sir.

If you permit me to add my little bit, मन्यु Manyu in Hindi is wrongly translated as anger. But Manyu is anger after मनन manan . After taking stock of wrong doers and then showing your anger effectively. If it was to be plain anger why do we pray मनुरsसि मन्युमयिधेहि .

There are two complete Rig Ved Sookts dedicated to Manyu. I am also taking the liberty to send attached herewith my interpretation of Manyu Sookts of Rig Veda. I will be grateful for the Vedic scholars to help in further refining these interpretations. In fact entire Maharabharat was sequel to Lord preaching the importance of Manyu to Arjun.

In Kashmir during the reign of Maharaja Gulab singh Muslims had memories of the exploits of brave men like Zorawar singh of Kashmir  and Masharaja Ranjit Singh's general Hari Singh Nalwa (It was the only time Afghanistan is known to have beenconqueredby any body in history). With these in their minds, the entire Muslim community is said to have expressed its willingness to be readmitted to Hindu faith. There appears to have been a finalization of the ceremonies for this with active initiative by Swami Dayanand Saraswati of Arya Samaj. But at that time the forefathers of Kashmir Pandits are said to have threatened to commit mass suicide by jumping in to Jehlum river if the Muslims were admitted to Hindu faith. The Maharaja had to backtrack.

This is one of history's Himalyan blunder for which we are all paying the price now. The Kashmir Pandits have nobody else to blame for their plight today.

With best regards,

Subodh Kumar
