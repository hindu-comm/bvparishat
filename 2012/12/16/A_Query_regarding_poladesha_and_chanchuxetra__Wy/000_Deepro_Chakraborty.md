Respected Scholars,

There is akāveryaṣṭottaraśatanāmastotra which I found on net \[<http://xa.yimg.com/kq/groups/2182732/415496781/name/Kaveri+Ashtottara+Shata+Nama+Stotram+-+TAM.pdf> \]. The eleventh verse of it is:

पोलदेशजनोद्धारग्रीष्मकालप्रवाहिनी।

चञ्चुक्षेत्रसमानीता छाद्मदोषनिवारिणी॥११॥

Here I don't understand which country is referred to here as Poladeśa and which place is calledCañcukṣetra. As the river flows only through Karnataka and Tamil Nadu these areas should be somewhere in these states.

  

Please enlighten me. 

Deepro.
