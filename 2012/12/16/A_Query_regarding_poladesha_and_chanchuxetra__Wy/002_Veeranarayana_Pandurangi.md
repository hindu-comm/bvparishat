I think पोलदेश should be चोलदेश.

चञ्चुक्षेत्र might refer to to the place from where the kaveri is  
brought from in a kumbha. but it is only a guess.

here is the story of kaveri

"The legend goes that the Kaveri river was held in a Kamandalu (a  
container of sacred water) by Sage Agasthya. Vinaayaka (Lord Ganesha)  
took the form of a crow and perched on the kamandalu of Agasthya when  
Agasthya was meditating. When Agasthya realised this, he shooed away  
the crow. But the devine crow tipped the kamandalu and toppled it. Out  
poured Kaveri which started flowing. "
