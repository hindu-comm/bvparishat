The ऋक्-s are found randomly in other संहिता-s also in different contexts with different purpose. Only the distinguishing item is only their individual collections.

  

श्रीसूक्त is in the खिल portion as I remember.

  

The same with पुरुषसूक्त also which has a different large portion addition in यजुर्वेद.

  

But यजुस् has its native, यजुस् of its own, after which it is named. But I think, ऋक्संहिता does not have any अनुवाक-s the characteristics of यजुर्वेद.
