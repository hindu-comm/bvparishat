Dear Colleague,

These post-Saṃhitā accretions (khilas) seem to have been shared by the RV, YV and the AV. Some of these like the Kuntāpas have found a place in the Saṃhitā of the AV Śaunakīya as 20.127-136 but they are known in tradition as khilas or Pariśiṣṭas. Some of them, eg the Pratyangirākalpa of the AV Paippalāda do not occur in the RV or the AVŚ . Both the AVŚ and AVP have a variant version apart from another version separately available. S.S.Bahulkar has a paper on this hymn (*The Vedas* Groningen, 2004 ed. JEM Houben ). Similarly the Vālakhilyas RV 8.49-59 do not find place elsewhere. 

Their position in tradition is, thus, anomalous. Most of the modern scholars term them apocryphal ie ‘spurious’ or later unauthentic additions.

The earliest modern critical treatment of these hymns may be found in Scheftllowitz *Die Apokryphen des Rgveda* (*Khilāni*) 1906. The VSM editon of the Rgveda Vol.4:891-912 gives an account of such material in both English and Sanskrit. This may be consulted for detailed information. But it is to be noted that their position is anomalous in our tradition too. Pandit Satavalekar’s account of the Khilas of the Rgveda do not agree with what we find in Scheftellowitz or the VSM edition of the RV. A new critical edition seems to be a desideratum. Before that any answer to the question raised may not be fully correct or satisfactory.

Best
