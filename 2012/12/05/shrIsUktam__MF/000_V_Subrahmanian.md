Namaste  
  
This is a question regarding the 'श्रीसूक्तम्’ . It is recited differently in Yajur veda and Rg veda. But in some printed books I have, only the Rg veda version is given and not the Yajurveda version.
I would like to know if this sUktam is there only in Rg veda but is adapted in Yajur veda with slight modifications in rendering?
