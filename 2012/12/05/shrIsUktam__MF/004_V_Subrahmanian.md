Namaste  
  
I quote from your above linked page:  
  
//The third Swami is leads the majestic Kanchi Veda-parayana-gOSthi and confirms SriSuktam is recited there only with the AgamAnusvAra - "IshvarIGM". He also concurs that while the suktam is found in RgVedam, the rk "gandhadvArA.." is present in their own Veda (Taittiriya Upanishad) with the ("-GM") AgamAnusvAra. Hence there is NO distortion in the Shruti as such.//  
  
Actually I was taught by a GhanapAThin at the Sringeri Mutt, Bangalore, long ago, the srIsUktam as stated above, and as recited every day during the Sringeri Chandramaulishwara pUjA the Jagadguru performs.  
  
But the rk "gandhadvArAm.." is not the only aspect of change in the KYV rendering. A few other places where the dIrghasvarita is present in the Rg.Veda version is only a short svarita in KYV rendering. For example: the 'hastinAda prabodhinIm' is recited in the Rg.veda version as hastinaaada...' but in KYV style as 'hastinAda....'. The words 'tasya phalAni tapasA nudantu' too follows this same variation in the two versions.  
  
  
Another friend who has studied the entire Krishna Yajur veda samhitA told me that the srIsUktam is not part of the KYV. I do not know how, by whom and when this practice of reciting the srIsUktam in the KYV style started.  
  
I have taken note of Shri Dipak Bhattacharya ji's post too.  
  
Thanks and regards
