Dear Cow lovers and scholars,

Lot of untiringly agitations and very sincere efforts have been continuously made by Cow lovers for protection and prevention of Cow slaughter. In addition to these activities . It is submitted that our learned persons, Brahmcharis in Gurukuls , Sant jan in Ashrams and Goshalas may like to consider Jap / recitation of Vedic mantras as prayers to protect our Gomata.

According to Atharv Vidhan for prevention of activities such as cow smuggling, killing, eating by suppression of their perpetrators, Athav Ved Brahm Gavi sookts 5.18, 5.19 and 12.5 mantras japa/ recitation should be carried out.

(for ease of reference these Sookts are being reproduced in the attachment here)

 अथर्व विधान के अनुसार गौ हरण, मारण, विशसन, वाधने, पाचन,भक्षणादि किए गए अभिचार कर्मों में अथर्व वेद के 5.18. 5.19 और 12.5 ( जो नीचे दिए जा रहे हैं ) मंत्रों से शत्रुओं को सम्बोधित कर के और मन में उन के प्रति द्वेषी भावना रख कर जप करे.

In Gosewa,
