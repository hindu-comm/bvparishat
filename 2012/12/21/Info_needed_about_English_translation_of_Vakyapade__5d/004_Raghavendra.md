English translation of Vakyapadeeya is available at Deccan College, Pune. This is not a verse to verse translation but a running commentary  
  
The best translation of Mahabhasya is from the pen of Yudhistir Mimamsak - but it is in Hindi. Yudhistir Mimamsak has covered the first two chapters whereas the subsquent ones are being translated by his deciples. this is availbale from ram lal kapoor trust

For understanding Ashtaadhyaayi I found the two volumes of 'The Ashthadhyayi of Panini" (Pub. Motilal Banarasidas) in English by Srisha Chandra Vasu very useful. This is based largely on Kashika i think. The sutras are explained in the order of of the sutra-patha.  
  
  
This should still be available in Vedanta Book House, Basavanagudi Bangalore.
