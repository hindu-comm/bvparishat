The last has been discussed by many philosophers beginning from Shankaracharya, Sri Ramanuja Acharya, Madhva, as the pioneers, up to till this date. Hence a new discussion about the 4th पुरुषार्थ as it is called properly, need not be discussed in this forum of ordinary scholars.

  

The Trivarga, which is useful for this life, accompanied with Dharma, as guded by Manu, was discussed by many scholar writers of Dharmashastra, Arthashastra, and Kamashastra, from time to time.

  

Manu, Yajnavalkya, Bodhayana and many have laid down the rules of Dharma, accomponying the two Artha and Kama, Dharma their main field. The two other Shastra-s have their own field, whether Dharma or Adharma, everything withing their field is discussed therein in the related texts.
