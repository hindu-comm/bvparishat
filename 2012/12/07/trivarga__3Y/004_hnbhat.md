The reply to your question lies in the quotation itself you have cited. The first itself clearly mentions their scope. The second explains the scope and objective. The fourth is not considered among the goals in this life, but only the matter of the other world or after life.

  

  

१.१.२ \> दुःखजन्मप्रवृत्तिदोषमिथ्याज्ञानानाम् उत्तरोत्तरापाये तदनन्तरा पायात् अपवर्गः\|\|  

  

This is the mention of अपवर्ग in Nyaya, The end of life cycle and how it can be achieved in this life as the fruit?

  

The same has been attained, But it is only that you can try to know about it in this life, as you are endowed with all the sensors to perceive the knowledge and in another life, you cannot be sure of having it.

  

As already mentioned, there is separate chapter मोक्षधर्माध्यायः in Mahabharata itself, for the benefit of those who aapire after to know it and which cannot be achieved as the fruit of any religious act following the scripture. For others, who do not believe scripture, there is no other life and or another world.

  

The same is described in other terms in different philosophical schools according to their theories.

  

निःश्रेयस, कैवल्य, प्रकृतिलय etc. Some have only तत्त्वज्ञान according to their theories.
