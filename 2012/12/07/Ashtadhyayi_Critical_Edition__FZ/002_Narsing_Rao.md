Well, what I really meant was a standard edition for the purpose of cross referencing. Nowadays, it is fairly easy to write computer programs that will automatically generate links to or even pull information from other sources. (For those knowledgeable about IT - I think it will be nice to have XML versions of these sources, which can be used to generate HTML or be used by programs for searching etc.)  
  
This becomes difficult if standardized versions of these sources are not available. Maybe we should call it a "standard edition" rather than a "critical edition", and it could even be a union of all the editions available, or whatever is agreeable to the scholarly community.  
  
Thanks,  
Narsing Rao
