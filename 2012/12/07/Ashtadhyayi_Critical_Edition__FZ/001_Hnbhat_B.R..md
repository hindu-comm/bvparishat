I don't think there should be a version all scholars should agree, including Patanjali and Kashika and Bhattoji.

  

But only we can expect selective/elective method for a critical Edition, in the strictest terms of Textual Criticism, which need not be acceptable to all the scholars.

  

And for scholars, already know there are two traditions, the Mahabhashya tradition of Ashtadhyayi, which is different in many respects from the KashikaVritti, and its commentaries. And Many have commented with different versions, of Ashtadhyayi. There can naturally be different versions.
