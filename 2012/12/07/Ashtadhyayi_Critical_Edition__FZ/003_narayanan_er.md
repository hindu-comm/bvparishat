Respected Scholars,

The Aṣṭādhyāyīsūtrapāṭha with Vārttikas, Gaṇas, Dhātupāṭha, Pāṇinīyaśikṣā, Paribhāṣāpāṭha and Sūtra Index Edited by C. Sankararama Sastri, Balamanorama Press, Madras, First Published 1927 has been reprinted in 1994 with an English Introduction by Professor Ratna Basu and published by B.L. Bansal for Sharada Publishing House, E-239, Shastri Nagar, Delhi-52 with ISBN : 81-85616-32-9 is available. Currently I am using this for reference, I mean for my very limited purpose. I do not know whether it is a standard edition or not. It also gives the corresponding Siddhantakaumudi order numbers to each sutra which is quite useful for cross referencing.  

Moreover, ८।३।९९ एति संज्ञायामगात् (ग २५३) ८।३।१०० नक्षत्राद्वा (ग २५३) are considered and marked as the Gaṇasūtra in brackets and given 1023, 1024 respectively as corresponding Siddhantakaumudi order numbers in the said text. Particularly ६।१।६२ (अचि शीर्षः)is given in a bracket with corresponding Siddhantakaumudi order number 1667 and again in bracket (वा ३४९४), as here I think वा stands for the Vārttika (please correct me if I am wrong). I am sorry if this was not the discussion intended.

Regards,

Narayanan
