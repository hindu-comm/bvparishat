There are some discrepancies in versions of the Ashtadhyayi used by  
eminent commentators. To be specific, the following sutras:  
  
८।३।९९ एति संज्ञायामगात्  
८।३।१०० नक्षत्राद्वा  
  
are considered to be sutras by Bhattoji (and also appear as such in  
several modern versions). However, the Kashika (supported by Nyasa and  
Padamanjari) considers them to be ganasutras. This throws off the  
numbering scheme, since ह्रस्वात्तादौ तद्धिते is considered to be 8.3.101 by  
Bhattoji, but 8.3.99 in the Kashika.  
  
Another example is the other way around:  
  
६।१।६२ अचि शीर्षः  
  
is considered to be a sutra by the Kashika, but a varttika by Bhattoji.  
Nevertheless, it is included in the sutra patha with a separate number.  
  
There may be other examples.  
  
So the question is whether there is a critical edition (or "canonical"  
version) of the Ashtadhyayi that all scholars agree upon? A standard  
numbering scheme (and this applies for other texts as well) is  
particularly useful in the information age since it will enable a  
reference using a single sequence number (for example A 3895 refers to  
ह्रस्वात्तादौ तद्धिते). An example of the power of such standardization is  
Strong's concordance: <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong's_Concordance>  
  
If this matter has already been discussed, please provide me with more  
information.  
  
Thanks,
