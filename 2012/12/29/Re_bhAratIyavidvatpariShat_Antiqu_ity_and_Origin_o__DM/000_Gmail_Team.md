Dear Sati Shankar, Thanks for posting the article of Dr. Pahoja



I am happy to see references to the kings of the Persian Empire. India suffered aggressions from the west. There is resentment to see into neighbors, house. But those who ruled us 200 years (British) and made the most damage to India, we are glad to talk about them but to talk about our ancient cousins in Persian Empire is no no. Thanks. N.R.Joshi

Like Aryan Invasion, we have many other issues to scrutinise and find out stable facts. The link given below is an attempt with to the point references,may we go through, verify and establish the truth. With this view I am sharing the document.
