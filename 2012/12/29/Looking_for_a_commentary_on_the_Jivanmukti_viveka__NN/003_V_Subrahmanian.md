My thanks to all members who gave me information about the book on the Jivanmuktiviveka.  
  
I heard that the commentary on the Panchadashi by Achyutarai Modak has been recently reprinted by an institution based in Lucknow. At present I have no other information about this publication. The copy I have is very old and carries a shAlivAhana shaka era date 1817 and is printed at Pune in a private press by a scholar.   
  
regards
