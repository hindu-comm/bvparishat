Namaste  
  
There is a Sanskrit commentary on the Jivanmukti viveka of Sri Vidyaranya by a great scholar Sri Achyuta Rai MoDak. \[ He has also penned a commentary on the Panchadashi (which I have)\]. I would like to procure this book either by purchasing or downloading. Any help in this is greatly appreciated.
