Friends,  
Greetings.  
I have been a reader in this group for a few months and have observed  
the great erudition exhibited by many. I am not proficient in writing the  
Sanskrit script though I have facility in reading and understanding. I am  
a physicist and learned Sanskrit to understand the scriptures. I am  
located outside India.  
  
Sanskrit is contextual and not literal. The literal analysis done to present  
the meaning of dhanya does not impress me. dhanyo'smi would mean  
that I am thankful for the opportunity to say/ask. (This opportunity is my  
wealth, dhana)  
  
In the spirit,  
dhanyo'smi
