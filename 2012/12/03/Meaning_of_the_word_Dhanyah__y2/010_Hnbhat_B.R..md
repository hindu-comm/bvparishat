The same topic has been dealt with in वाक्यपदीय, in ब्रह्मकाण्ड long ago, in its different aspects and अखण्डः स्फोट or only sentence is considered as the unit of speech, being analysed in its different dimensions, like वर्ण, पद, जाति, etc. and do not have independent entity exclusively of the other. And finally arrived as अखण्डस्फोट after examining the other possible analyses.

  

When one wants to analyze, प्रकृति-प्रत्यय analysiz helps. Accent analysis was left out by Panini himself, except for selected intonations in the ordinary speech, leaving apart the accent system for Vedic usages. Now if we are to identify the accentuation system in Sanskrit, which is characteristic of Spoken language, we have to revive the Vedic accentuation system to govern the words in the application of spoken Sanskrit, if you mean "oral literature" which is used to denote श्रुति traditionally which is not used in general literature so far and one is free to infer any accentuation and assign any meaning to any word, unless one fixes the accentuation system to Classical Literature.
