I have given the answers found by our ancestors भर्तृहरि in his वाक्यपदीय, as the name itself suggests, all relating to वाक्य and पद which based on the authentic text महाभाष्य developing his ideas suggested here and there.

  

There may be many more aspects, which are not dealt with in these texts and can be developed from others like Buddhist philosophers and Naiyayika-s, Mimamsaka-s themselves.

  

I don't think the "Sanskrit" in your concept will include these texts or not. My knowledge is limited to these written texts only. Origin of speech itself has been clearly laid down its basic accessories to पाणिनीय अष्टाध्यायी, which is also equally applicable to Vedic and Classical Literature in general, पाणिनीयशिक्षा -

  

आत्मा बुद्ध्या समेत्यार्थान् मनो युङ्क्ते विवक्षया ।

मनः कायाग्निमाहन्ति स प्रेरयति मारुतम् ॥६॥



मारुतस्तूरसि चरन्मन्द्रं जनयति स्वरम् ।

प्रातःसवनयोगं तं छन्दोगायत्रमाश्रितम् ॥७॥



कण्ठे माध्यन्दिनयुगं मध्यमं त्रैष्टुभानुगम् ।

तारं तार्तीयसवनं शीर्षण्यं जागतानुगम् ॥८॥



सोदीर्णो मूर्ध्न्यभिहतो वक्‍त्रमापद्य मारुतः ।

वर्णाञ्जनयते तेषां विभागः पञ्चधा स्मृतः ॥९॥



अष्टौ स्थानानि वर्णानामुरः कण्ठः शिरस्तथा ।

जिह्वामूलं च दन्ताश्च नासिकोष्ठौ च तालु च ॥१३॥

  

Though basically dealing with the speech sounds. (not only physical sounds).

  

Since you claim as a beginner, I do not want to drag the topic into deep waters as I could not understand what you want to assert specifically.

  

With regards
