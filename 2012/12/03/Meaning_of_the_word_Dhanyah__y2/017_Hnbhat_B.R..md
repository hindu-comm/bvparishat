I think both of us are going towards opposite directions, and unless the point is round enough, like the globe, we cannot meet each other at any point.

  

I do not know Neurology but only Sanskrit Grammar and yourself know Neurology as your subject and Sanskrit as a beginner.

  

Thank you for your inputs. मनस् or mind is considered as कर्मेन्द्रिय as well as ज्ञानेन्द्रिय, and in its both capacities, it is used in the speech production as the mediator in converting the images stored in the memory into verbal images and vice verca inward input as a new thing/word is perceived/heard as the case may be. This was all I had in mind. And the layer of speeches into 4 also has the same stages inward and outward,

  

परा, पश्यन्ती, मध्यमा - and finally विखरी which is the fully accomplished speech conveying communications between the human beings capable of maintaining such insufficient, but in itself competent means for conveying it. This is the same process of पाणिनीय has suggested.

  

The परा is nothing but the resident consciousness and its contact with external world outward and inward will have to undergo the stages, before verbal expression or verbal perception.

  

This is my limited understanding of the process.
