Yes. I agree with it. It is a mode of self-expression.

  

विवक्षा is one of the means to express oneself. Hence the 4 stages are classified as परा, पश्यन्ती, मध्यमा, as the preliminary stages. Only vocal expression is the endowment of human beings, others being common for animals and even all the living beings. The language system is endowed. This is expressed by the statement, according to me,

  

तुरीयां वाचं मनुष्या वदन्ति

  

in the interpretation of the ऋक् - "[](http:///)चत्वारि वाक् परिमिता पदानि" as can be seen in this viki page:

  

[वाक्तत्त्वम्](http://sa.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E0%A4%B5%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A4%E0%A4%A4%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A4%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B5%E0%A4%AE%E0%A5%8)  

  

Please refer to these topics also for the exposition of the same idea:

  

<https://groups.google.com/d/topic/samskrita/j7kIhdQWyc0/discussion>  

  

Here you can see the authentic discussion about शब्दव्यापार

  

<http://sanskrit.uohyd.ac.in/Corpus/CIIL/Shabdhabodhavimarsha/shabdabodhavimarsha_proof.txt>  

  

on the speech production according to Tantric based 4 levels of speech.

  

I think you will agree that Sanskrit is not an language as discussed in this topic :

  

  

<https://groups.google.com/d/topic/samskrita/j7kIhdQWyc0/discussion>  

  

Here a discussion about the nature of पश्यन्ती layer is discussed in this group long ago:

  

<https://groups.google.com/d/topic/bvparishat/H5cK3nOGce4/discussion>  

  

And, why the impulse to convey one's feeling or perception is triggered, may be a different aspect and try your best in the Sanskrit Literature.

  

"spontaneous expression" is conveyed by the idea स्फोट theory at the best.

  

With or without any external stimulation, is a different topic than Grammar or philosophy of Grammar is related and why one wants to make use of the gift he is endowed with, which other living beings lack, i.e. articulation of speech sounds is another issue. Men created language or the Gods created it is another aspect widely discussed and why they created it and make use of it is left to the discretion of the users of the language. (note not the words, syllables, or sentences analyzed) as an tool to convey their expression.

  

  

Thanks for your inputs of new way of thinking.
