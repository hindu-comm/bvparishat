Dear Dr HNBhat,  
The stimulus of an utterance creating a visual image is different  
than a thought (mental image) creating an utterance. This has to  
do with origin of speech, how and why we express ourselves.  
I am looking for literature separating expression and communication.  
In creating expression, we possibly generate bhAva, which connects  
to the object that prompted the expression.  
pada, sabda, vAkya are morphological analysis for literature.  
syllable is the morphology of speech creating the nucleus for the pada.  
  
I would love to be referred to any literature analyzing the development  
of the Sanskrit phonemes. Panini and grammar deal with the use  
of organs, the question would be before the impulse to use the organs.  
  
I am sorry to drag this. I am just a student trying to understand  
from the first principles.  I believe Sanskrit has an answer to the  
origin of speech unlike the currently accepted theories in linguistics.  
  
Best regards,  
BM
