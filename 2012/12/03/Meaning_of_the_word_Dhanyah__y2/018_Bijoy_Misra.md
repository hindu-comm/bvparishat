Yes, we are talking about creating and constituting a pada.  
There could be no "desire" to articulate using the muscles,  
but a self-expression of an emotion.  
I will keep looking in the literature. As I said analyzing a  
sentence is different than discovering how a sentiment  
arises to create a syllable. The word is a mapping.  
It is not clear if an emotion is instinctive or is triggered by  
stimulus. We have to check how an emotion causes a  
sound. We look. We know the pada literature. We need  
to look to the phoneme literature which possibly exists.  
This has to do with the completeness of the phonemes in  
expressing thoughts.  
Best regards,
