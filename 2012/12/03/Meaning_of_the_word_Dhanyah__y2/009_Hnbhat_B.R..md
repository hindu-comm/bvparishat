If one leaves aside the traditional meaning as we know from the works in Sanskrit both lexical and general, technical words, one can assume any meaning to any word.

  

There has been a saying by Nagesha Bhatta, if I remember correctly ---

  

"सर्वे सर्वार्थवाचकाः।" only

  

the identification with syllables would make synonym सरः, रसः both having the same ra, sa, +visarga , only changed in their order.

  

Any theory can be put forward, according to ones' will and pleasure, without any authentic reference to classical literature.

  

That is a fact. Here is an old discussion on the topic discussed by scholars of this forum:

  

<https://groups.google.com/d/topic/bvparishat/9WZdwdDMxJY/discussion>  

  

यथा – ‘शवतिर्गतिकर्मा कम्बोजेष्वेव भाषितो भवति, विकारमेव त्वेनमार्या भाषन्ते शव इति’ as per Yaska and  

  

तत्यथा । शवतिः गतिकर्मा कम्बोजेषु एव भाषितः भवति ।

विकारे एनं आर्याः भाषन्ते शवः इति । हम्मतिः सुराष्ट्रेषु रंहतिः प्राच्यमध्येषु गमिं एव तु आर्याः प्रयुञ्जते । दातिः लवनार्थे प्राच्येषु दात्रं उदीच्येषु ।  

  

This was said at the time when महाभाष्य was written and Nirukta was written for Vea. I don't think the same thing can be said today, where the words of Sanskrit are used in a different sense in Sanskrit, in daily use. (I mean Sanskrit, not their use in the regional languages).

  

Scholars may differ in their opinion.
