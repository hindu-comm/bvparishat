It has long been agreed, that it is the conceptual image of the thing referred by the utterance which gives rise to the visual image and this image is called the अर्थ, and the image recalled later along with hearing or seeing the thing or on listening to the same utterance related with it, that forms the convention.

  

बौद्धश्च शब्दः, बौद्धश्च अर्थः।

  

But superimposition in the utterance heard as the words, and the referred thing as the meaning of it, is called इतेरेतराध्यास, or superimposition of each other. This gives to the rise to the usage "the word cow" as different from the thing meant from the word, which in present. Without which you cannot have the language system operated or handled with Grammar.

like the word is only conceptual and the like.
