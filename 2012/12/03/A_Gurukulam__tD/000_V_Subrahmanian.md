Namaste  
  
Last week, while on a tour of some parts of Southern India, I visited a Gurukulam close to Mysore. The place is situated in Belagola and is called 'Vishvakshema Trust'. There is a fairly large campus where an upcoming Temple for Sri Lakshminarasimha Swamy forms the centre of activity and over eighty students studying Veda and imparted modern education. There is a cool flowing canal of the Cauvery through this campus. We were greatly impressed by the work done there. One can visit the place for an enchanting experience. Here is their website:
