Dear Jagannathji,



Your information is correct. But I have to add only some detail.

According to the information given on the title page of the work the *Word Index to Patañjali’s Vy**ākaraṇa-Mahābhāṣya *was jointly compiled by Pandit Pāṭhak, whom you have mentioned, and by Pandit Siddheshvarashastri Chitrao. The two also compiled a Word-Index to the Sūtrapāṭha of Pāṇini and its Pariśiṣṭas published by the BORI in 1935. Pāṭhak was a Mahāmahopādhyāya.

Among others, the books mentioned by you were monumental and no one can afford to miss them while working on Pāṇini but they do not have anything special to do with technical terms and techniques on which the enquiry had been made by the first correspondent.

But I thank you!

Best

DB
