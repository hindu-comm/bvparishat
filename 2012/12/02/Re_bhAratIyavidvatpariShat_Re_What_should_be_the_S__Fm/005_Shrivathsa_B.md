hariH OM,  
RNI Sir,  
  
samanvaya in the literary sense means "summing up" and resolving conflicting versions. Hence this may not be the appropriate name for synergy.  
The following is what i got from [dictionary.com](http://dictionary.com) (you may skip to my conclusion highlighted in yellow below for brevity).  

## syn·er·gy

\[sin-er-jee\] Show IPA

noun, plural syn·er·gies.

1. the interaction of elements that when combined produce a total effect that is greater than the sum of the individual elements, contributions, etc.; synergism.

2. Physiology, Medicine/Medical . the cooperative action of two or more muscles, nerves, or the like.

3. Biochemistry, Pharmacology . the cooperative action of two or more stimuli or drugs.

  

***Origin for the root of "synergy" which is "synergism": ***  
1755–65; \< Neo-Latin synergismus \< Greek synerg ( ós ) ‘working together’ ( syn- [syn-](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/syn-)+ érg ( on ) [work](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/work)+ -os
adj. suffix) + Neo-Latin -ismus [-ism](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/-ism)  
where syn = combiningwith, together with

  
 We need a word which captures the above meaning. i.e.  
bringing together various sources of work to achieve a single goal (where the effect of the combined work is more than the effect of individual works).  
  
 The following are what come to my mind.  
**1. saMparyudyamaH = synergism  
2. samAkalitAH udyamAH yasmin saH = samAkalitodyamaH (i am not sure if this is the right samastapada, i don't know if this can be made shorter).  
3. We can make word 2 larger and capture more meaning by adding pari: samparyAkalitAH udyamAH yasmin saH = samparyAkalitodyamaH.  
  
** please take all three above words with a question mark because I am unsure about them.**  
** in the first word, saM = in a good way, profoundly, pari = all around, udyamaH = work.  
 in the second word, saM = in a good way, profoundly, kala = to heap up, udyamaH = work.**    
**  
svasti,  
 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,  

shrivathsa.
