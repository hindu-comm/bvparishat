"synergy" is used in the sense 'the (extra) energy or power that arises from the sheer fact of being together' sa:nghiibhavanottha uurjas / uurjaa / ;sakti / bala is the usually intended meaning of the word.

  

Of course we should not use the whole Sanskrit paraphrase given above as a word for "synergy", but sa:nghorjas / sa:nghorjaa can acquire the same meaning through context and usage; it will be a madhyama-pada-lopin samaasa.

  

Similarly, for "synergic",sa:nghorjjika can be used.

Maanyavar,

The word "Synergetic" was brought in to lim light by German physist Herman Haken some 30 -35 years back and now in fashion as "Synergy".

Originally it was intended to present "co-operative effort" or "Cooperative approach" to solve some specific problem from multi-disciplinary way.

  

What should be its Sanskrit word?

  

My interest in it is because, some twenty years ago, I named my Foundation as "Global Synergetic Foundation" and now looking for an appropriate Bharatiya Name for it.

  

I would be obliged and hopefully a thought upon it would enrich Sanskrit dictionary as well.
