Swasti, Pl. consider the words---'Sangha' or 'Sanghatana'. Your foundation may be named as 'Vaishvika-sangha(Sakti)-sthanam' or Vishva-sanghatana(Sakti)-nyaasah' or suchlike. It may be noted that any word may convey several related meanings, so the 'Sangha' may mean 'Sanghorjas, or 'Sangha-shakti' also. Regards,

Subject: {भारतीयविद्वत्परिषत्} Re: What should be the Sanskrit of word "Synergetic"

  
  
Dear Mishra ji,

Cooperative gives exact sense but unfortunately it is "classified" by the Govt and Law as word for 'commercial cooperation', as also evident from the options you have kindly listed and requires different licencing. however when I named my foundation it was intended to be " multi-disciplinary,humanitarianefforts foe upliftment of Human knowledge and well being". In academic sense.

As you are so well versed in Sanskrit, you can find a better word for "what was intended"easily than as a lay man like me.

Any way thanks for giving attention to my query.

Regards

Sati Shankar
