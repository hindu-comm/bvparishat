Dear Haresh Gala,

  
  
  
"All Words/Symbols are not actual word/symbol but they represent symbolically properties/characteristics of Human/Living Beings"  
  

Please explain I cannot understand the above sentence. It is beyond my limited comprehension. I understand Yaska, Sayana, Skanda Swami to a very limited extent.  
  
"TWO आर्हत - बार्हत Philosophies working side by side in Indus Civilisation and all Seals should be Interpreted with this in Mind."  
  
Please be kind and let me know what is आर्हत - बार्हत Philosophical thought?. Is this one more way to better understand the Indus Seals' ?  
  
Regards  
Ajit Gargeshwari
