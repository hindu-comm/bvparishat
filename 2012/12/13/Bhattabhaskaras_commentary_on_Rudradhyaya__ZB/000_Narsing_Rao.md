It is generally believed that Bhattabhaskara's commentary on Kanda 4 (which contains the Rudradhyaya) of the Taittiriya Samhita is not available. However, Anandashram has published a commentary on the Rudradhyaya with the commentaries of Sayana and Bhattabhaskara. (These are widely quoted, but I am not sure of the original source).  
  
In the introductory part of the Anandashram publication it is mentioned that this commentary was obtained from one Gangadhara Ananta Nitsure, resident of Wai (Satara district, Maharashtra) (apparently as a published book, not a manuscript).  
  
My questions are:  

-   Is this commentary of Bhattabhaskara considered to be authentic? -   Is there a documentation of the manuscripts on which this commentary
    is based?

  
Thanks,  
Narsing Rao
