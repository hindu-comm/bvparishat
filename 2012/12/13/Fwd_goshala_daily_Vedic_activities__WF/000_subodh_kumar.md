Respected Vedic Scholars,

Based on Rig Vidhan, & Grihy Sootras etc. enclose effort has been made to describe the daily routine Vedic activities in Goshalas.It will be noticed that our Vedic procedures are entirely validated by modern veterinary science practices.

Respected scholars are requested to help in making such document more complete.

With profound regards,
