Respected scholars,

  

Maruts in Vedas, represent the subjects covered in the sciences of Biotechnology, & microbiology.Evolution of modern scientific thought
is witnessed as a continuous development from Descartes’ mechanistic world to Newtonian mechanics to Einstein’s relativity/

In the realm of life sciences such as agriculture similar evolution is seen from inorganic chemical fertilizers to organic fertilizers to soil and plant microbiology.

In field of medicine similarly researches made a start with search of
medicines as for various diseases. Great progress has been made on pathogens- disease causing germs, bacteria and viruses to find
antibiotics and vaccines as disease fighting tools. In the earlier times it was thought that all microorganisms were disease causing pathogens.

But of late life supporting role of microorganisms is established with
discovery of Probiotics. As a result it is now realized that all microorganisms may not be responsible for disease only. It is now also acknowledged that majority of the microbe are agents for promoting
life.

In meteorology there was a time when rain was considered a purely physical phenomenon consisting of cloud formation by simple evaporation, physical movement of clouds and precipitation by ice nucleation in the clouds. But with discovery of Pseudomonads Syringe bacteria a linkage of microbes with ice nucleation of the water bearing clouds in environments is noted. This idea is found linked in Yajurveda 17.3

.

While studying a Yajur Veda Mantra 17-1, one is struck with the Vedic description of the formation of fertile virgin soil by disintegration of rocks on the mountains being caused by ‘MARUTS’. **यजु 17।1**

****

अश्मन्नूर्जं पर्वते शिश्रियाणामद्भय ऒषधीभ्यो वनस्पतिभ्यो अधि सम्भ्रतं पय:। तां न इषमूर्जं धत्त मरुत: संरराणा अश्मस्ते क्षुन्मयि त ऊर्ग्यं द्विष्मस्तं ते शुगॄच्छतु ।। यजु 17-1।।

**मरुत: संरराणा: **O Maruts, providers of food etc in plenty

**अश्मन्नूर्जं पर्वते: **Minerals held by cohesive forces on the mountains

**शिश्रियाणामद्भय:** disintigrated particles to chelate in to liquids

**ओषधीभ्य: वनस्पतिभ्य: **For herbal medicines and food

**अधि सम्भ्रतं पय: **The liquids and waters to provide nourishment like cow's milk

**तां इषं ऊर्जं न: धत्त **Provide for our food and energy

**अश्मन ते क्षुत् **All consuming fire may satisfy its hunger so that

**ते ऊर्ग्यं मयि **Their essence parts may come to me

**ते शुक् तं ऋच्छतु यं द्विष्म: **your wrath may consume the enemies, the pathogens



O Maruts disintegrate the rocks on the mountains in to their particles( which are held to gather by cohesive energy in the stones) to 'chelate them in to liquids for the enrichment of waters, vegetation and herbs, like the nutrient providing milk from a cow. The 'havi' provided is for the fire to consume, to provide its essence through Maruts to us, and for destroying the 'germs' inimical to us, ie desease and pests of the crops.

Disintegration of rocks on the mountains is known to be caused by the microorganisms by their penetrating the rocks. The broken down 'dust' of the rocks forms the alluvial soil, which is brought down by the streams and rivers from the mountains in to the plains as ever replenished fertile new soil, in which all the vegetation grows.

The mineral particles in the soil are further acted upon by the microorganisms present in the soil and the water particularly the rain waters, when used for irrigation, 'chelates' converts the mineral particles of soil in to liquid for for the root system of the vegetation to receive the nutrition for the growth of vegetation. All organically grown product is immune to pests and desease. This also incidently applies to those who consume organic products.

Vedas consider these ‘Maruts as the building blocks of life itself.
According to modern science microbes are instrumental in weathering and disintegration of rocks for the formation of virgin fertile soil. Microbes are also seen as the building blocks of life .A thought suggests itself to me , what if Maruts by any stretch of imagination could be correlated with microbes. The next mantra (Yajurved 17.2) enumerates the numbers of these building blocks of lifeand goes on to describe the infinitely large numbers involved.

यजु१७।२

**इमा मे ऽअग्न ऽइष्टका धेनवः सन्त्वेका च दशच दश च शतं च शतं च सहस्रं च सहस्रं चायुतं चायुतं च नियुतं च नियुतं च प्रयुतं चार्बुदं च न्यर्बुदं च समुद्रश्च मध्यं चान्तश्च परार्द्घश्चैता मेऽ अग्नऽ इष्टका धेनवःसन्त्वमुत्रामुष्मिल्लोके॥यजु ॥१७।२**

अग्ने इमाः इष्टकाः मे धेनवः सन्तु

इष्टक से साधारण अर्थ ईंटें यहां वेदी की ईंट लिया जाता है. यहां महर्षि दयानंद ने अपने यजुर्वेद भाष्य मे एक दिशा दी है. इष्टक से अभिप्राय हमारे इष्ट को सिद्ध करने वाले साधन बनते हैं. जैसे ईंटों से बनी वेदी अग्निहोत्र यज्ञ द्वारा हमारे मनोरथ पूर्ण करने मे सहायक होती हैं, वैसे ही गौ हमारे जीवन में . इन साधनों को अंग्रेज़ी भाषा में संसार का बिल्डिंग ब्लाक कहा जाता है. आधुनिक विज्ञान के अनुसार ,इस संसार के बिल्डिंग ब्लोक माइक्रोब होते हैं. 

**---**-The above building blocks \<¹इष्टिक; may be like cows to me सन्त्वेका च दश like one to ten च दश ten tens=100शतं च शतं च सहस्रं ie=10,000=104ten thousands( here it may kindly be noted that according to this Yajurved mantra Sahasra appears to be ten thousand and not one thousand as normally taken in popular arithmetics)च सहस्रं च सहस्रं चायुतं=108चायुतंच नियुतं= 1016च नियुतं च प्रयुतं=1032चार्बुदं = 1064च न्यर्बुदं =10128च समुद्रश्च=10256 मध्यं being the mid oceanचान्तश्च=10512परार्‌ध्द्‌श्चैता to outer space.

एताः इष्टः अमुत्र च अमुश्मिन्नलोके मे धेनवःसन्तु

इस वेद मंत्र में जो गणित की इतनी बडी संख्या की बात हो रही है, तो यह चिंतन का विषय है कि वेदिक ऋषि क्या असन्ख्य, अगणित ईंटों से बनी यज्ञ वेदी की बात कर रहा है, या इतनी बडी संख्या मे गौओं की बात कर रहा है? इस संसार को बनाने वाले असंख्य तत्व तो माइक्रोब्स ही हैं, इन्ही को वेद मन्त्र इष्टिका की संज्ञा भी देता है.

पहले मंत्र 17/1 के संदर्भ में देखने यह स्पष्ट हो जाता है कि वेद इस इस यजु 17/2 मंत्र मे हमारी अभीष्ट कामनाओं की सिद्धी करने वाले मरुतों की ही बात कर रहा है , जिन्हे आधुनिक विज्ञान माइक्रोब्स नाम से पुकारता है



So many of these building blocks forming this world and outer space, may be like cows to fulfill my needs

Microbiology is indeed a very new science. According to ASM American Society of Microbiology in Frontiers of microbiology BSCS2006"The sheer number of microbes on earth is staggering. It has been estimated that we share the planet with 5X10**³¹**microbes, which weigh more than 50 million quadrillion tons, constituting nearly 90% of earth's mass.

The various properties of maruts ie being live organisms, having many different colours, shapes, sizes, being sensitive to optics, sonic and electromagnetic fields, capable of gene transfer, and voracious eaters, growing in numbers exponentially, being probiotic and pathological ie disease bearing and also antibiotic in character are properties associated with maruts in vedas.The large numbers of these *ishtakas* that Vedas are saying could be related to the microbes in the entire universes.

This second mantra is the key to the suggestion that maruts are indeed related to microorganisms of all kinds, which the modern science is yet in the process of identifying and studying.

Note. The Vedic system of numbers is a very clear strategy to use squares after ten, ten tens ie hundred, hundred hundreds ie ***Sahasra* again *Sahasra Sahasras ie* squared and then the resulting number is called *AYUTAM.* An *Ayuta* is a square** and so on. Thus the Vedic system deals with numbers far beyond the concepts of modern number systems.******

**यजु 17।3**

**ऋतव:स्थऽऋतावृधऽऋतुष्ठा: स्थऽऋतावृध:। घृतश्च्यतो मधुश्च्यतो विरजो नाम कामदुधाऽक्षीयमाणा:।।**

**ऋतवृध: ऋतव: स्थ----**-Stable system of season wise provision

**ऋतावृध: ऋतिष्ठा:------**attaining their growth according to the seasons

**घृतच्युत: मधुश्चुत: विराज: नाम कामदुधा: अक्षीयमाणा: स्थ **----providing the sweetness and nutritive bounties like a cow fulfilling all our desires and not causing any harms to us.

These are the working of microorganisms in providing fruits, vegetables and cereals of nutritive quality, sweetness and flavours according to seasons by working through soil, irrigation and atmospheric actions

Thus these useful microorganisms perform the functions of the proverbial cow *KAMDHENU* by working through vegetative worlds to meet all our desires.

Lest there is an impression given by this mantra, that these microbes function only in the botanical world, there are ample reference in Vedas, to the functioning of the microbes by the action of enzymes in the production of milk in cows by the action in rumens and the
digestive assimilation of our food through our intestines in working of fermentation in food products in human body etc.

. Subsequent Mantras Yaju 17.4 indicate roles that Maruts play by their presence on ocean floors, where they exist at very high temperatures in the vicinity of volcanic eruptions on the ocean floor.****

**( MODERN SCIENCE ON MICROBES UNDER SEA :**

**On ocean floor under water geysers, were discovered in 1977. Seawater is sucked in to cracks in ocean floor, where it encounters molten rocks-magma of under water volcanoes. The hot magma super heats the seawater which is forcibly discharged back in to ocean**

**through thermal vents. When superheated mineral rich sea water meets the super freezing temperature on ocean floor, minerals precipitate out of sea water and their deposits form tall chimney like structures. These are called Hydrothermal underwater vents. A wide variety of organisms live near these vents. **

**Modern science todayrecognizesthat Bacteria rather than the plants are the producers and initiate the food chain in this ecosystem.**

****

**Microbes living at the high temperatures **

****

Modern science of geochemistry in rhizosphere, is investigating how the microbes in the roots of plants in marshes and under sea, act upon the soil to release oxygen, to pick up various mineral elements from the sludge and sediments, to harvest and store them in the plants and thus
leave the soil clean and free of polluting minerals. In fact sea weeds are the primary source of the modern day precious element Magnesium.

The oceans by their overpowering all enclosing actions through clouds,
winds, marine life, algae , corals, krill, fish, minerals and immense inexhaustible source of such known and unknown bounties proceed to clean our ecosystem of pollutants, and provide fertility and nutritive rich rain water for the welfare of humanity.

Modern science of microbiology has traced microorganisms signatures in the snowflakes, being carried from the oceans from where the specific clouds had originated. These microorganism play the principle role in enriching the soil and vegetation by the rains they bring with them selves. The electricity charges carried with the microorganisms by the snow flakes, give rise to atmospheric thunder, which again has a big role in enriching the food cycle, creating nitrogen fixation, and destruction of atmospheric pathogen pollutants by the ozone and UV radiation resulting from thunder & lightning..

It is also noted that only the useful 'probiotic' microorganisms appear to leave the oceans with the pure water in the clouds forming there. In fact there are Rig Ved Mantras which talk about learning to distinguish good microorganisms from 'bad' ones. This is an area for modern microbiology to yet attempt to explore.

The polluting materials in the oceans are digested by the microorganisms in the oceanic 'soup' to fix as edible forms of algae, corals, krill and marine life, and harvest the polluting metals from the sewage waters.

## This is how heat loving microorganisms work for our welfare in actualizing vedic direction of *SHIVO BHAV.* 

## Thermophilic Microbes and Their Thermostable Enzymes for Lignocellulose Conversion 

**[Rajesh K. Sani]()**¹, Aditya Bhalla², Venkat Kunreddy³, Vasudeo Zambare⁴, Kenneth Bischoff⁵, David Dixon⁶ and Lew P. Christopher⁴, (1)Department of Chemical & Biological Engineering, South Dakota School of Mines & Technology, Rapid City, SD, (2)Chemical and Biological Engineering, South Dakota School of Mines & Technology, Rapid City, SD, (3)Center for Bioprocessing Research and Development, South Dakota School of Mines & Technology, Rapid City, SD, (4)Center for Bioprocessing Research & Development, South Dakota School of Mines & Technology, Rapid City, SD, (5)Bioproducts and Biocatalysis Research Unit, USDA-ARS, NCAUR, Peoria, IL, (6)SD School of Mines and Technology, Rapid City, SD

  
The literature suggests that current strategies for sustainable and economical processing of lignocellulose into biofuels is limited due to high production costs of lignocellulose-hydrolyzing enzymes; the very slow enzymatic hydrolysis kinetics of release of sugars from lignocellulose; and the low yields of sugars from lignocellulose. These issues can be addressed using enzymes and organisms naturally adapted to environments of extreme temperature. At high temperatures, bioreactors can offer faster, more effective and reliable conversion of substrates to commodity chemicals due to increased solubility and hydrolysis of lignocelluloses as well as a lower potential for contamination. Our group has been working on extremophiles from the deepest mine (2.5 km deep) - the Homestake Gold Mine, Lead, SD (also known as NSF DUSEL) and from a local compost facility for lignocellulose conversion under thermophilic (≥60oC) conditions. Using deep subsurface (1.34 km) and compost facility soil samples, we have isolated several thermophilic cellulose- and xylan-degrading pure cultures belonging to the genera Brevibacillus, Paenibacillus, Bacillus, and Geobacillus. Unique characteristics of DUSEL cellulases and xylanases include optimum temperatures of \>70°C, pH ranges from 4 - 8, and high thermostability (e.g., at 60ºC, 50% of cellulases and xylanases activities were lost in 35 and 23 days of incubation, respectively). In addition, DUSEL thermophiles grew on various carbon sources and produced ethanol from cellulose in a single step. These thermostable enzymes and robust thermophilic fermentative microbes should facilitate development of more efficient and cost-effective forms of the simultaneous saccharification and fermentation process to convert lignocellulosic biomass into biofuels.



Similarly in next mantra Yaju17.5 Maruts are indicated deep buried under ice under very cryogenic microbes.

**Cryophilic MicrobesYaju 17.5**

**यजु 17।5**

**हिमस्य त्वा जरायुणाग्ने परिव्ययामसि । पावको ऽ अस्मभ्यं शिवो भव।।17।5**

****

.When fully buried under deep snow in cold regions of the earth, all fallen plants and dead bodies, and organic substances, get preserved. The unhealthy malevolent microorganisms of death ,decay and diseases, which may have been in them, get destroyed, as if if the death of pathogens is caused by sheer old age starvation, and burning by fire.

(Veda is here talking about the phenomenon of preservation at low temperatures, Freeze drying for preservation and cold storage, may not be after all, such modern techniques, when understood and appreciated
in Vedic context)

How Maruts purify water;

Y17.6 Water Purification



**उपज्मन्नुप वेतसेऽवतर नदीष्वा । अग्ने पित्तमपामसि मण्डूकि ताभिरागहि सेमं नो यज्ञं पावकावर्णं शिवं कृधि।।यजु 17।6।।**

**अग्ने पित्तं आपसि------** pitta and agni is fever in water i,e,
polluted water

**मण्डूकि ताभिरागहि-----**marine life like frogs & fish family, get at that

**उपज्म उपन्न वेतसेऽवतर नदीष्वा-----**growing plants of cane reed
family which are secondary crops ( crops not fit for human consumption, but use as biomass and is fit cattle fodder etc.) in the beds of streams of such water .

**सा इमं अस्माभि यज्ञं पावकवर्णं शिव: भव-----**may provide us with
means to purify the polluted water for our welfare.

This happens to be the most recent modern strategy to treat sewage and polluted waters The Polluted water is run in to ponds with frogs, fish like marine life, and then this marine life treated water is run in to streams. On the beds of these streams plants of cane & reed family are grown. The final run off water is clean water.

This technology has been known as 'root zone treatment' and was first promoted by NASA scientists, and is described in his book "Growing Clean Waters "by the NASA scientist Dr Wolverton.

Modern science is also growing special plants in polluted waters, for harvesting to extract specific minerals, as a very cost effective strategy, to not only purify polluted waters but also extract the dissolved minerals. Sea weeds happen to be the main source of world
Magnesium.

  

**यजु 3-44,45,46**

**प्रघासिनो हवामहे मरुतश्च रिशादस: । करम्भेण सुजोषस: ।।3।44।।**

**प्रघासिनो------** Voracious eaters of (cooked) food

**हवामहे-------** we** **exult in glorifying

**मरुतष्च-------**-the maruts the microorganisms

**रिशादस: ------**destroyers of enemies --killers of pathogens by antibodies to create health giving probiotics

**करम्भेण -----**by mixture of curd with oat flour --Yeast as starter

** सुजाषस: ---**with vigour**-**

In context of ***Grihasthashram*** the topic under context The mantra directly refers to the enzyme microorganisms as voracious eaters of
food to create health giving contents to our food by growing more microorganisms which modern nutritive science calls as probiotics found
in all fermented foods.

**यद्ग्रामे यदर्ण्ये यत्सभायां यदिनन्द्रिये । यदेनश्चकृमा वयमिदं तदवयजामहे स्वाहा।। 3।45।।**

Whatever wrong actions we have done in habitations, forests, and in communities, we want to rectify that wrong.

**मो षू ण इन्द्रात्र पृत्सु देवैरस्ति हि ष्मा ते शुष्मिन्नवया:। महिश्चद्यस्य मीढुषो यव्या हविष्मतो मरुतो वन्दते गी: ।।3।46।।**

O powerful Indra in these battles, by operating through Maruts the microorganisms, stay for our welfare, by bringing rains that bring nourishment through foods to us, and do not allow any harms to us.

Maruts in human digestion

**यजु 25।07 Yajurved 25.07**

**पूषणं वनिष्ठुनाऽन्धाहीन्त्स्थूलगुदया सर्पान्गुदाभिर्विह्रुत आन्त्रैरपो वस्तिना वृषणमाण्डाभ्यां वाजिनं शेपेन प्रजां रेतसा चाषान् पित्तेन प्रदरान् पायुना कूश्माञ्छकपिण्डे:।।यजु 25.07**

**पूषणं ---------------**The healthy digestive system** **

**वनिष्ठुना स्थूल गुदया----**intestine work to produce well formed stools

**अन्धाहीन सर्पान गुदाभिर्विह्वत आन्त्रैरपोवस्तिना----**from intestines producing watery stools, exit blind snake like creatures

**वृषणमाण्डाभ्यां वाजिनं शेपेन रेतसा प्रजां------**From well formed healthy testicles through male organ the sperms produce good progeny

**चाषान---------- **from various foods



**प्रदरान----------**in the stomachs

**पायुना-----------**intestinal digestive processes

**शकपिण्डै: कूश्मान-----**----produce a healthy body which should be a continuous subject of study and research.

The mantra extolls the role played by the microorganisms in processing our food and how healthy body is reflected in the proper functioning of our digestive system, and its role in maintaining the sperm counts to ensure good healthy progeny, and the healthy body to provide the frame work for a mind to devote itself to study and research.

Maruts in Environment****

**Y25.20 in Environment give healthy body and cattle**

**यजु25।20**

**प्रृषदश्वा मरुत: पृश्निमातर: शुभंयावानो विदथेषु जग्मय:। अग्निजिह्वा मनव: सूरचक्षसो विश्वे नो देवा अवसाग्मन्निह ।।यजु 25.20**

**पृषदश्वा-----------** who nurtures strong horses

**मरुत: ---------- **microbes

**पृश्निमातर:--------- **who occupy space

**शुभंयावानो-------- **those who provide welfare and prosperity

**विदथेषु ------- **fighters of battles with enemies the disease bearing pathogens

**जग्मय: -------- **those who assimilate

**अग्निजिह्वा मनव: ---------**those who have fiery tongues

**सूरचक्षसो ----**those who give birth and create by their mere presence

**अवसागमन्निह--- **may dwell here with their ability to provide protective shelter

The mantra says that the microorganisms which nurture strong household animals like horses cows etc. These microbes have fiery tongues to battle with diseases and pollutants and digest these undesirable elements to provide us health and welfare. These microorganism grow even in space , giving rise to their activities by their mere presence, and they may make their dwellings in our households.

  

Vedassay that the Maruts in air that we breath provide ‘Life’
Could Microbes provide science with the link missing in inanimate matter and life? मरुतः प्राणेन (अवकीर्णः प्रविशति), मरुतः प्राणैः (सहास्मिन्‌ कर्मण्यागच्छन्तु) 

 **1.Maruts have life like entities – This is stated repeatedly at 18 places in Rig**

** Veda ¹**

 **2.Maruts are always referred to operate in a multitude, as an army Marut ganas. **

 **3. Modern science also confirms that the microorganisms as building blocks of life , are present in infinitely large numbers on the earth, estimated at 10^(31 by ASM-American Society of Microbiology.). Veda mentions the number of 10³⁶ as the Maruts in the universe. ^(3 –Yaju 17-2)**

 **Maruts according to Vedas are of many different varieties, shapes, sizes and colors .⁴ **

 **The outer space is the birth place / habitation of Maruts, from where they come to earth .⁵**

 **They take birth, multiply, and die, but are born in maturity as adults, always in youth, not going through phases like infancy and old age .⁶ **

 **7. Scientists find the microbes like the Vedic Maruts of
different bright multicolor, shapes and sizes. Griffith in his translation of Vedas refers to Maruts with resplendent multicolored bejeweled medallions with their weaponry, to fight its enemies.**

 **8. Maruts have sonic, qualities .⁸ ( Shankh- a conch shell- is blown to purify the sacred place to destroy bad germs.**

 **9. Maruts are also born during fires, physical friction, electrical spark and operate through electric fields .⁹**

 10. **Maruts are voracious eaters of cooked food & grow in numbers exponentially (Fermentation). ¹⁰** 

 11. **Maruts are all beneficial organisms which destroy malefic organisms.**

 **12. Maruts cause disintegration of rocks for Fertile Soil formation & organic agriculture.¹²**

 **13. Maruts treat sewage and waste water for disposal, like the microorganisms .¹³. **

 **14. Maruts bring rains from cloud on to earth(Pseudomonas Syringe) .¹⁴ **

 **15. Can help produce artificial rain. ¹⁵ **

 **16. Maruts create big sounds under the earth. When these earth shaking noises are heard, living beings get scared of immense catastrophes- It is observed that cattle, birds etc have a premonition /early warning of natural disasters like earth quakes. (Veda is suggesting a method for early detection of large earthquakes by monitoring underground sonic signals**.**.) ¹⁶**

****

****All these modern scientific attributes of the microbes, are directly talked about Maruts in Vedas. Some of the topics which modern microbiology is yet to explore and Vedas frequently talk about are like: **Vedas say all naturally born microbes are ‘good’, ones and different from germs. Modern science having gone to microbiology by medical route made a start with disease control strategies through antibiotics, and is still not very focused on life supporting microorganisms the probiotics. Vedas want to know which are the good ones and what distinguishes them from bad ones, what motivates the
actions of good ones, and how to look for them.** **Maruts are always referred to in multitude, as an army Marut ganas. Modern science also confirms that the microorganisms are present in infinitely large numbers on the earth, estimated at 10³¹. Veda mentions the number 10⁵¹² as the maruts in the universe.

Shankh is blown to purify the pooja place to destroy bad germs.**As per YajurvedChapter 17,**Maruts are voracious eaters of cooked food & grow in numbers exponentially.** **Maruts are all beneficial organisms which destroy malefic organisms. Maruts cause disintegration of rocks for Fertile Soil formation & organic agriculture, Maruts treat sewage and waste for
disposal, like the microorganisms.** All these modern scientific attributes of the microbes, are directly talked about Maruts in Vedas.

I wonder if respected scholars will comment on this suggestions that Maruts corresond to Micro organisms of modern science.
