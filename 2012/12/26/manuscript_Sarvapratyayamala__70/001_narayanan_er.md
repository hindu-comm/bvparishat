The following information is from:

"Information regarding the commentator, Sankararya also is equally scanty- From the closing sentence of Nivi   
a commentary on Rupavat^ra of Dharmakirti, it is seen that it was written by Sankararya of the Parasava family. But the Same-   
ness of name will not be sufficient to show that the author of Jayamangala and of the Nivi are identical, as against it there is the fact that nowhere in the commentary has our commentator made rfny mention of his ancestry. And the author of p. grammatical work called Sarvapratyayamala also bears the name of Sankararya. But he makes a display of his own name as well as of his brother by inserting them in the body of his work, whereas the author of Jayamangala, in the full confidence that the merit of his work would be sufficient guarantee to make his name famous did not stoop to put in his name in the body of the work. From the vanity of the one and the magnanimity of the other, it is not likely that they may be one and the same person." Trivandrum. T. GANAPATI SASTRI  
  
The family name Parasava (പാരശവഃ) (पारशवः) is indicating Variyar caste of Kerala, so we may guess that one Sankara Variyar might have composed it. There could the chance of manuscripts of this Sarvapratyayamala in the Trivandrum Manuscript Library, which is to be investigated. I tried with the search in Roman with "Sarvapratyayamālā", but nothing resulted except this [archive.org](http://archive.org) quotations; as the Kamandaka Nitisara was published under TRIVANDRUM SANSKRIT SERIES NO. XIV. Once the manuscript is traced the colophon towards the end to confirm author, date etc.
