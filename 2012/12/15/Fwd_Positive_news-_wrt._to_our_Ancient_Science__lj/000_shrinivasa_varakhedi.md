The Traditional Knowledge > Digital Library (TKDL) been able to check the piracy of ancient wisdom > related to medicinal plants cost-effectively.

> > TKDL, a collaborative project of the Council of Scientific and > Industrial Research and the Department of Ayurveda, Yoga and > Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy, is situated in Ghaziabad, > U.P. It uses the tools of information technology and a novel > classification system to make available traditional medical knowledge > to patent offices in major developed countries so that what was known > for centuries in India is not patented by unscrupulous individuals, > companies and research organisations as something they claim to have > discovered or invented by themselves. >
> Biopiracy, or misappropriation of TK is rampant, not just in India but > in a host of countries rich in bioresources across the African and > Latin American continents. The TK of 110 developing countries is > vulnerable to theft and capture. Initially, TK documentation lacked a > rigorous classification system. Vinod Kumar Gupta, who set up TKDL, > devised a modern classification based on the structure of > International Patent Classification (IPC) for India’s traditional > systems: Ayurveda, Unani, Siddha and Yoga. >
> This knowledge, found in Sanskrit, Tamil, Malayalam, Kannada, Arabic, > Persian and Urdu texts, is inaccessible and incomprehensible to patent > examiners overseas, even to many in India. The focus of TKDL was on > breaking the language and format barriers by scientifically converting > and structuring the available TK in IPC. The novel classification > system which was developed, the Traditional Knowledge Resource > Classification (TKRC), has resulted in a fundamental reform of IPC by > enhancing the TK segment from one sub-group to 207 sub-groups, thus > enabling effective search and examination process. >
> The knowledge culled from ancient Indian texts is stored in 34 million > A4 size pages and translated into five foreign languages. Now, > Sanskrit slokas can be read in Japanese, English, Spanish, German and > French languages by examiners in international patent offices on their > computer screen. >
> TKDL has signed access and non-disclosure agreements with the Indian > and seven other global patent offices. This ensures near-foolproof > security for our invaluable bioresources against piracy. All of this > required not just high-end technology but also skills of a high > technical order. And there were people with knowledge of ancient > texts, modern medicine and technical terms of foreign languages. This > was a tremendous exercise of global proportions and the price for this > unique propriety system was Rs. 16 crore. >
> In the last three years, TKDL has identified 1,000 cases of biopiracy > of India’s TK. In 105 cases, patent claims were withdrawn or cancelled > by the patent offices which gave the patents — decisions that were > effected in just 4-5 weeks at no cost to India. All that is required > is an e-mail to the relevant patent office. >
> This is the biggest benefit for India, which cannot afford huge legal > fees in fighting biopiracy. That is also the case with time. For > instance, it cost the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export > Development Authority (APEDA) seven years and Rs 7.62 crore in legal > fees to fight the intellectual property rights battle for basmati > rice. The adjacent graphic gives crucial data on this. >
> If one goes by the data in the above graphic, it would cost India > close to $200 billion to defend and protect 2,50,000 formulations > already listed in TKDL. >
> A recent study has revealed that there has been as much as a > 44-per-cent decline in patent claims filed on Indian systems of > medicine. This is what probably prompted the Government of Peru to > publicly declare its intention of setting up an institution similar to > our own TKDL. >
> TKDL protects about a quarter million Indian formulations culled from > our ancient texts. Now it also includes videos of the most common yoga > postures. This is a response to the national furore over the > increasing number of patents being granted in the West for yoga > exercises. >
