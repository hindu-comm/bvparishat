Dear Scholars

Namaste,



The year 2012, has come a full circle. 17^(th) January and the Annual Conference is imminent. And I await your participation in the conference, with pleasure and excitement.

Preparations for the conference are in full swing. The Yogi’s who will be awakening our consciousness, are Padmabhushan Dr. BKS Iyengar-ji, (Founder, Ramamani Iyengar Memorial Yoga Institute, Pune), Swami SARPV Chaturvedi-ji (Founder, Sri Ramanuja Mission Trust, Chennai), Swami Govind Dev Giri-ji, (Founder, Veda Vyasa Foundation, Pune),Swami Chidatmananda-ji (President-Chinmaya Mission, Hyderabad), His Highness Shri Khemsawant Shivramsawant Bhosale (Sawantwadi).

I do hope you will ensure your presence at the Confluence of these Yogis whose knowledge will permeate amongst us as “Divine Power”.

You are well aware of the pioneering work our Institute has been doing, since the days of (Late) Dr. M.L.Gharote, in spreading the knowledge on Traditional Yoga.

In order that you do not miss out on a fruitful and enriching interaction with the enlightened Yogi’s, I beseech you to register yourself for the International Conference by sending a registration fee of Rs. 1000/- only, latest by 25^(th) December.

It is really the Rarest Confluence of Five Divine Souls and golden opportunity to Reap the Benefits of Their Divinity. Also please visit
