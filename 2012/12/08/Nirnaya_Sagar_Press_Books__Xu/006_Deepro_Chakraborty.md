Respected Wakankar Sir,

  

Thanks for your message. Shakara Jī has given me the link to the Marathi book. But I'm not competent enough in reading Marathi. Shankara Jī informed me about another book by Vinayak Kulkarni which is in English. I have just ordered the book through interlibrary loan.

Also, I would be very grateful if you could give me any biographical reference to the celebrated Āyurveda editor, Jādavjī Trikamjī Ācārya (Yādava S'arman). Many of his editions were published from the Nirnaya Sagar Press.

Sincerely,

Deepro.
