Dear Dr Shrivara,  

I have am also enclosing the excel sheet prepared by us. As of now all the links are working i have double checked.  

  

Please note  



Bar Codes are different for different servers in some cases. So, if the bar code from one server does not work, you can search for the same title at a different server and try to download the book. As you might know DLI has 5 servers, some of them are down sometimes. Last 2 are the fastest.

**Option I** Use DLI Downloader

**Option 2**



Another option is to use batch-downloaders like IDM. I have almost stopped using DLI Downloaders for downloading books from DLI. I prefer to download the images first using IDM (Internet Download Manager) and then bind them using Adobe Acrobat Pro. Though this involves 2 steps, IDM downloads the images much faster than the other softwares. You can download IDM from any torrent site.



I assume that you have installed IDM in your machine. Giving below step by step instructions for batch-download from DLI.  
Suppose you want to download the following book.

  
[rgvedic culture of the pre-history.](http://202.41.82.144/cgi-bin/metainfo.cgi?&title1=rgvedic%20culture%20of%20the%20pre-history&author1=sankarananda,%20swami&subject1=NULL&year=0%20&language1=english&pages=196&barcode=99999990265065&author2=NULL&identifier1=NULL&publisher1=ramakrishna%20vedanta%20math&contributor1=NULL&vendor1=NONE&scanningcentre1=uod,delhi&slocation1=NONE&sourcelib1=central%20library,%20delhi%20university&scannerno1=0&digitalrepublisher1=NULL&digitalpublicationdate1=0000-00-00&numberedpages1=0&unnumberedpages1=0&rights1=not%20available&copyrightowner1=NULL&copyrightexpirydate1=0000-00-00&format1=book%20&url=/data4/upload/0117/869), 99999990265065. sankarananda, swami. 0. english. NULL. 196 pgs.



1. When you click on the above DLI link, a new page will open and an image will open or get downloaded to your PC. Note the location of this image. Copy the url of the image. In this case it is as follows.  
[http://www.dli.gov.in/data4/upload/0117/869/PTIFF/00000001.tif](http://www.dli.gov.in/data4/upload/0117/869/PTIFF/00000001.tif)  
  
2. Now, open the batch download dialogue in IDM. It is in the file menu. IDM will automatically display the copied link. Its screen shot is shown in the attached image - IDM Batch download starting.  
  
3. Now, note the number of pages of the book. In this case the book has 196 pages. As 196 is a 3 digit number remove last 3 digits from the image URL and replace it with \* inside the address bar of IDM batch download. Now it will be,  
[http://www.dli.gov.in/data4/upload/0117/869/PTIFF/00000\*.tif](http://www.dli.gov.in/data4/upload/0117/869/PTIFF/00000*.tif) (as shown in second image attached to this mail).  
  
4. Fill remaining as follows:  
  
From: 1  
To: 196  
Wildcard size: 3.  
  
5. Now, click 'OK'. Links to all images of the book will appear in IDM main window. Click, "start queue". IDM will start downloading four or five images at a time and within a few minutes, all the pages of the book will be downloaded to a folder specified by you in IDM 'options'.  
  
6. Create a single pdf of the images using a suitable software. That is it.  
Though the above procedure may appear a bit difficult in the beginning, as you go on using it, you will be able to do it your eyes closed.

  

If you have further questions or difficulty please inform me
