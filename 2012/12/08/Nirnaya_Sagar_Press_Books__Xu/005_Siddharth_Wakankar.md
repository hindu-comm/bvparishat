Dear Deepro,

  

There is a Marathi book giving the history of Nirnay Sagar Press and its activities,which I think,was published as a Centenary vol.I forgot the details but will try to get them.Will you be able to read and understand Marathi.

  

Best luck in your search for an English book.  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar
