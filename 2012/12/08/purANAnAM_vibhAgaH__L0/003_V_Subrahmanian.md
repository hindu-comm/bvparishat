Namaste  
  
True. In the above context I am reminded of these verses of the Bhaagavata purANa, which is classified as sAttivka:  
  
Daksha yagna:

श्रीभगवानुवाच

अहं ब्रह्मा च शर्वश्च जगतः कारणं परम् ।

आत्मेश्वर उपद्रष्टा स्वयं दृगविशेषणः ॥५०॥

आत्ममायां समाविश्य सोऽहं गुणमयीं द्विज ।

सृजन् रक्षन् हरन् विश्वं दध्रे संज्ञां क्रियोचिताम् ॥५१॥

\[Brahmaa - sRiShTi (Rajas), VishNu - sthitiH (sattva), Shiva - samhAra (tamas)\]  

तस्मिन् ब्रह्मण्यद्वितीये केवले परमात्मनि ।

ब्रह्मारुद्रौ च भूतानि भेदेनाज्ञोऽनुपश्यति ॥५२॥

यथा पुमान्न स्वाङ्गेषु शिरःपाण्यदिषु क्वचित् ।

पारक्यबुद्धिं कुरुते एवं भूतेषु मत्परः ॥५३॥

*त्रयाणामेकभावानां यो न पश्यति वै भिदाम् ।*

*सर्वभूतात्मनां ब्रह्मन् स शान्तिमधिगच्छति ॥५४॥*

  
(IV.7.50 – 54)

(50) *Lord Vishnu said: 'I, Brahmâ and Lord S'iva as well, do not differ in being the supreme cause and Supersoul, the witness and the self-sufficient one of the material manifestation.(52) Him the Supreme Brahmân that is without a second, is as one Supersoul with both Brahmâ and S'iva, but the living ones who are not conversant with this, think of them as being separate.* (53) The way a person sometimes does not make a difference between the head, hands and other parts of his own body, so does My devotee thus make no difference between living beings. *(54) He who having the one nature of the Three, verily is the Supersoul in all beings. He who does not see the separateness, o brahmin, realizes the peace.'*

  

According to the above verses Hari (Vishnu) is Himself taking the roles of Vishnu,Brahma and Rudra and accomplishing the functions of Creation (rajas), Sustenance (sattva) and Destruction (tamas). He says these are the guNa-s of mAyA that He has in Himself. He also says that the 'three' of Them are really One and one aught not to make any real difference between the three.  

  

If the rAjasic and tAmasic categories of purANas are highlighting those particular aspects, guNa-s, then from the above declaration of Bhagavan it follows that those categories are also only His different aspects highlighted and not really different from Him.  The last verse says that the Three together form the Self of the entire creation.  

  

To say that the rAjasic and tAmasic purANas are not teaching the Truth but only the sAttvic ones do would go against the very declaration of Bhagavan shown above. One is also reminded of the Bhagavadgita 2.45:

  

त्रैगुण्यविषया वेदा निस्त्रैगुण्यो भवार्जुन ।  
निर्द्वन्द्वो नित्यसत्त्वस्थो निर्योगक्षेम आत्मवान् ॥४५  

  

  

Further, Destruction (tamas) cannot be really ignorance that is negative. Every being in creation will require a mandatory sleep, withdrawal from activity, for otherwise there cannot be a continuity of life. This applies to Creation too where there has to be a samhAra/praLaya in the cycle that gives way to a fresh sRShTi. That way, Shiva, the tattva of samhAra, tamas, is not ignorance that causes bondage or deludes one from knowing the Truth. The Bhagavatam itself, in the very Daksha yajna section, describes Shiva as the 'Jagadguru', an epithet very popularly given to Vishnu: Krishnam Vande Jagadgurum.   

  

The famous composer-saint Sri Purandaradasa sings the praise of Shiva in a composition commencing: chandrachUDa... There he says: ಪರಮ ವೈಷ್ಣವ ನೀನೆ (Oh, Shiva, you are the foremost among Vaishnavas) and ಗರುಡಗಮನ **ಶ್ರೀಪುರಂದರವಿಠಲ**ಗೆ ಪ್ರಾಣಪ್ರಿಯನು ನೀನೆ (You are the dearest to Lord Vishnu): [**http://tinyurl.com/blzves2**](http://tinyurl.com/blzves2)

Shiva is regarded as 'manaHkAraka devatA' who is worshiped for bestowing pure devotion for Vishnu.
