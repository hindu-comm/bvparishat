One can profitably go through the introductory portions of the Sivatattvarahasyam, a detailed commentary by NiilakaNThadiikshita on SivaaSTottarashatanaamastotra. Also the self-commentary called Sivatattvaviveka by Appayadiikshita on his own well known text, SikhariNiimaalaa, verse12 and 13 discusses about this point. They have ably refuted the wrong view according to which all the PuraaNa-s that speak of Siva are grouped as taamasa while all that deal with VishNu are grouped as saattvika.
