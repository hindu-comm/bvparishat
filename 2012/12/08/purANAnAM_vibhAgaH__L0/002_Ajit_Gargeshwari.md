Puranas fall into the category Smrti. The lists of Puranas vary from place to place and from time to time, and they are enumerated and classified in multiple ways.  
  
According to Padma Purana, Uttara-khanda, 236.18-21  
  
Satvic Puranas - Srimad Bhagavatham, Vishnu, Varaha, Garuda, Brhad-Nardiya, Padma  
Rajasic Puranas - Brahma, Brahmavaivarta, Brahmananda, Bhavisya, Surya, Markendaya  
Tamasic Puranas - Shiva, Linga, Skanda, Kurma, Vamana, Agni  
  
This method of classification of Puranas deploys division of the gunas which tend toward purity (sattva), impurity or ignorance (tamas), and passion (rajas). Thus, there are those puranas where the quality of sattva is said to predominate. According to another scheme of classification, these are also the puranas in which Vishnu appears as the Supreme Being. A second set of puranas, also six in number, are described as exhibiting qualities of ignorance or impurity (tamas), and in these Shiva is the God to whom devotion is rendered: Matsya; Kurma; Linga; Shiva; Skanda; and Agni. In the third set of six puranas, the quality of rajas or blind passion supposedly prevails: Brahma; Bramanda; Brahmavaivarta; Markandeya; Bhavishya; and Vamana. The list of eighteen is sometimes enlarged to twenty, to include the Vayu Purana and the Harivamsa.  
  
Clearly this of classification, which shows every sign of sectarianism, is inadequate, since none of the puranas is devoted exclusively to either Vishnu or Shiva.  
  
Appayya Dikshitar classifies Puranas into five  
  
Bramhma---Brahma and Padma.  
Brahma---- Brahma Vaivarta.  
Agni--- Agni  
Siva---- Siva , Skanad, Linga, Kurma, Vamana, Varaha, Bhavishya, Markandeya, Matsya and Brahmanda,  
Vishnu--- Nararada, Bhagavata, Visnu and Garuda  
  
The traditional number given as 18 Purana and 18 Upappuranas may not be all inclusive or exhaustive for one has Sthala Puranas , Kula puranas, Jain and Buddhist Puranas.  
  
The definition of a Purana by Amara, has five distinguishing topics:- (1.) The creation of the universe; (2.) Its destruction and renovation; (3.) The genealogy of gods and patriarchs; (4.) The reigns of the Manus, forming the periods called Manwantaras. (5.) The history of the Solar and Lunar races of kings."These are the Pancha-lakshanas or distinguishing marks, but no one of the puranas answers exactly to the description; some show a partial conformity with it, others depart from it very widely.
