Namaste  
  
I am one of those who experienced great pleasure of this event, though my attendance was for just two hours. It was indeed a thrilling experience to be in the program. One aspect, among many, that requires special mention is: An expert rendered a kAvya vAchana set to a tune and the moment he stops the avadhAni gave a reply that consists of: the name of the kAvya, the author and the context (sandarbha) in the same tune (rAga), again in the same meter-kAvya style. This is something amazing. Sri Ganesh has proficiency in music too and he simply excelled in it.  
  
He remarked that for the six crore Kannadiga population there are hardly ten avadhAni-s today. His cherished desire is to see that at least sixty are trained in this great art and this three-day event could facilitate this goal.  
  
Just two months ago I had had the joyful experience of attending his samskrita-only ashTAvadhAna.  
  
Long live this art of avadhAna
