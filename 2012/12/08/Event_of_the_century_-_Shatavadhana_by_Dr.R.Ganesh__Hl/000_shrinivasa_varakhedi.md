Dear Scholars,

  

It was an event of the century - last week Dr. R.Ganesh successfully performed first ever shatavadhaana in Kannada. Thousands of Bangalore elite public witnessed this grand literary program. Though the program was in Kannada language, the entire stage was full of ubhaya-bhasha-kovida - scholars of Sanskrit and Kannada both.

  

It was a record event that has ever happened in entire nation. For all the three days Avadhaani Sri Ganesh never seemed tired. He was full of energy and his hundreds of compositions made spectators speechless. Humorous comments on aprastuta prasanga kept the hall joyous. Scholars hundred in number were throwing challenging problems on Avadhani. Dr. Ganesh answered all those with his evergreen smile. Bharatiya Vidwat Parishat is proud to have Shatavadhani Dr.R.Ganesh as one of its stalwart members.

  

The following link is for the people who could not attend the program.
