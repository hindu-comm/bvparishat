Namaste,  
  
With help Of Shankaraji I have prepared a list of Sanskrit books  
published by Nirnaya Sagar Press. The excel also gives links to  
Digital Library of India and other public domain website from where  
the books can be downloaded. The list excludes books printed under  
Kavyamala , Kavya Mala Gucchaka series. The list also excludes books  
printed by Nirnaya Sagar press and not published by them. For a few  
books I could find links from where it can be downloaded. If any  
titles are missing please populate the excel.  
  
Link to open and view the spread sheet
