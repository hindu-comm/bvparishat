Respected Swamiji,

Namaste. I feel that the fundamentals of Nyaya could be taught in regional languages too but for only a limited extent. For instance, we are not seeing many a number of अवच्छेदक , अवच्छिन्न, प्रतियोगि and अनुयोगि etc. in the fundamental texts like the Tarkasangraha, Karikavali and Muktavali. When we move on to Dinakari and Ramarudri we see all these in plenty. But on the other hand once one starts to learn Tarkasangraha, Karikavali and Muktavali in traditional way with a bit of grip over Sanskrit which could yield more prosperous result than avoiding Sanskrit terminologies. Once one thinks to grow upto understand Dinakari, after having the Muktavali is being understood through any regional dialect, then he has to make a grip over Sanskrit and these Nyaya terminologies; and not only that Nyaya is not only for Nyaya, but for the other Sastras too. Majority of commentary works with higher information use Nyaya terms to establish their theories authentic, and using grammatically sound usages too. Once we skip an established idiom for convenience, then there should be the consequence too. This is what happening to Sanskrit language learning too, when one learns through local dialect. Initially it could be tolerated to have at least a काव्यव्युत्पत्तिः, but when you turn on to the Sastras you need traditional terminology in Sanskrit and the idiom of the concerned Sastras. All those terminologies of अवच्छेदक , अवच्छिन्न, प्रतियोगि and अनुयोगि etc. could be taught by understanding their functions but to be explained with extra effort in regional dialects. In higher education of any Sastra you cannot compromise with the traditional terminology as their significance are explained in corresponding idiom only. Scholars understands the Nyaya concept through Sanskrit and concerned idiom, then they try in regional dialect for convenient communication. It could be make successful, but it is up to capacity of eminent Naiyayikas like you who can converse both in Sanskrit and Kannada. But problem only could be solved when you see substitutes for the lakshana-s of these terminologies of अवच्छेदक , अवच्छिन्न, प्रतियोगि and अनुयोगि etc. But one learns the Tarkasangraha only he could have it even with the regional dialects. We have the results of translations and explanations in English by Mahamahopadhyaya Ganganath Jha to several Nyaya and Vaiseshika texts. These are exceptions. To follow the right way understanding one has to look into the original Sanskrit too. This is my humble opinion, still I am not an expert of any of these Sastras.  

Regards,

Narayanan
