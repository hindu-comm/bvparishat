Namaste ,  
  
To answer with a direct reply. It is a clear NO. No one can understand Navya Nyaya without knowing Sanskrit.  

  
अवच्छेदक , अवच्छिन्न, प्रतियोगि  

The above words are the basics of Navya Nyaya  
  
"How can anyone teach without explaining these concepts?"  
  
You are asking this questions without knowing what is Navya Nyaya  
  
Dr Bhat is speaking in his domain as a Gramarian. Dr Narayan has tried to partially answer you question  
  
So here is the bottom line  
  
Learn Navya Nyaya and the ask question. Navya Nyaya terms are untranslatable in other words you cannot translate the though a few attempts by Prof. Ingalls and others.

Ajit
