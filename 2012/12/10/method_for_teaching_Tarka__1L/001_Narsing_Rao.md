I believe this should be possible using terminology in Philosophy and Logic in the language of choice, assuming that it has sufficient expressive power. For example, in English, we would use the following terms:  
  
Means of knowledge (प्रमाण), Objects of knowledge (प्रमेय), Discussion (वाद) , Parts of syllogism (अवयव), Examination of other doctrines (अन्यतम परीक्षा) , Proposition (प्रतिज्ञा) , Reason or Condition (हेतु) , Example (उदाहरणम्), Application (उपनयः), Conclusion (निगमनम्), Predicated, Discriminated, or Particularized (अवच्छिन्न) and so on.  
  
Similarly, the न्यायसूत्राणि can be expressed in any language  
  
१.१.३३ साध्यनिर्देशः प्रतिज्ञा - **Proposition** is the statement for which the truth needs to be ascertained  
  
Terminology may be to be invented if there is no corresponding term in the target language (for example, निःश्रेयस् or अपवर्ग). It's much easier in Indian languages since many Sanskrit words can be used directly.  
  
I am not an expert in Nyaya, and not sure if this is what you meant.
