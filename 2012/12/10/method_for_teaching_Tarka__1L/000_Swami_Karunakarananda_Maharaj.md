Respected Scholars,  
Is Nyaya Shastra for only those who hold total grip on the language they use? Without knowing Sanskrit, is it possible to teach Nyaya to students who are interested?  
More specifically, can one teach Nyaya in regional languages without using their terminology of अवच्छेदक , अवच्छिन्न, प्रतियोगि etc?
