hariH OM,  
shri gargeshvari,  
  
 Please do not jump the gun. Don't call Dr. Rajaram's postings as "False information or Crazy thoughts about Indus Scripts."  
  
 You have never countered any "false"hood or "craziness" in his posts. Don't use abuse as argument. In case you do so, you are as culpable of calumny as the poster of the "crazy" thought against Shankara. I personally have benefited immensely by some of his cross-postings (this is besides the matter in discussion right now).

  
  
svasti,  
 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,  

shrivathsa.
