Well said Shrisha Raoji,  
  
This whole thread was not needed in the first place. BVP has better issues to discuss.  
  
Passing arbitary and baseless comment on Sanakracharya. False information or Crazy thoughts about Indus Scripts. Quarrel with Prof Witzel or Steve Farmer. Cross postings with mailing lists. BVP is not the place.  
  
A scientist trying to pose himself as an eminent Indologist who has a solution to all problems that might be the complacent attitude of one but there need to be takers for ones assumption.  
  
Cross postings not worth any answers. Each list has its own objectives.  
  
  
Quarreling with list owner or moderator is not tolerated by any mailing list.  
  
Regards
