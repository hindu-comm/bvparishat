Nobody, just the list creator/owner. What did you think?  

  
\> Is he a self-appointed censor or what?  
  

See above. Anyway, his request was only to avoid cross-posting replies (from threads originating elsewhere) to BVP, and this is an eminently reasonable constraint, hardly censorship. There are a number of online resources (and even some books) on Netiquette, if you're not sure how to comport yourself online.  

  
\> "Not acceptable" to whom? To this Pandurangi?  
  

And to most others here, I suspect. Each forum has a particular focus, and no one forum can be all things to all people. One can always carry one's interests elsewhere if a particular forum is not suitable for them, and this is hardly unreasonable.  

  
\> I find his postings intolerant and unacceptable.  
  

Which surely says something about him. Or perhaps about you.  

  
\> Is he the sole standard for everyone to follow?  
  

Certainly his writings are more courteous and informative than yours, so I personally would regard him as more of a standard, yes, though I would hardly agree with him on everything.
