Once the moderator clarifies that this forum is for Sanskrit related things, there is no use of bringing politics and news here and then questioning the moderator. When you signed up, you must have read the motives to create this list, I hope.  
You asked to whom these posting are not acceptable. It's not the naiyAyika pANDura\~NgI, but me and many who are using this list to learn intricacies of Sanskrit and scriptures written in this language. I've never ever read your postings. I just skip them, once I came to know that you are not a scholar of Sanskrit language.
