You are right; the Atmanepada form can be used only with वि or परा (PS 1.3.19 विपराभ्यां जेः). Shankaracharya's commentary makes it clear that (at least his version of ) Mundaka 3.1.6 has the form जयति. He says: सत्यमेव सत्यवानेव जयति नानृतं नानृतवादीत्यर्थः ।  
  
However, it is disconcerting to note that the incorrect form (if it is indeed deemed so) appears on our National Emblem - one sees it everywhere - currency notes in particular. (The Lion Capital of Sarnath certainly did not have this inscription). How did this happen?
