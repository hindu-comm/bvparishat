First of all, saying a form is "non-Paninian" is not the same as saying that it is "incorrect". There are several forms in Vedas/Samhitas which are not covered by Paninian grammar. If a वैय्याकरण says the a form is "non-Paninian", the statement ends there. If the statement is misinterpreted as the वैय्याकरण passing judgement on Vedic forms or saying a Vedic form is wrong, it is misinterpretation on behalf of the reader at best. Panini fit a robust and parsimonious mathematical model on thousands and millions of data points (available forms), and though the variance explained is not 100%, he reached very close (this is no mean achievement, and no wonder he has been called the pinnacle of human intelligence). Saying that a data point does not lie on Panini's multidimensional curve in a hyperplane is not same as saying the data point is corrupt.  
  
Secondly, there is very likely a पाठभेद in case of Mundaka 3.1.6. - many published works have it as सत्यमेव जयति and many others have it has सत्यमेव जयते as already pointed in my first post. पण्डित चारुदेव शास्त्री in his work व्याकरणचन्द्रोदय Volume 4 (Motilal Banarsidass, early 20th century) quotes both forms. Swami Akhandananda Saraswati in मुण्डकसुधा (Sat Sahitya Prakashan Trust, 1967) discusses both readings. If such scholars have mentioned alternate readings, then very likely multiple traditional readings existed for the Mantra.

Good try @ sarcasm but I will take that also as आशीर्वाद from you. Two quick points offered in your चरणकमल  

-   The comparison is far-fetched. Discussing two versions of संहितापाठ
    (सत्यमेव जयति/सत्यमेव जयते) is not same as agreeing/disagreeing with
    a पदपाठ. संहितापाठ is pure पाठ by a ऋषि मन्त्रद्रष्टा whereas पदपाठ
    is an analysis (one out of 11 "विकृति"पाठs of वाक्यपाठ, पदपाठ,
    क्रमपाठ, जटापाठ, मालापाठ, शिखापाठ, रेखापाठ, ध्वजपाठ, दण्डपाठ, रथपाठ,
    and घनपाठ) by an आचार्य using व्याकरण to analyze the संहिता. In
    Sanatana Dharma, one does not differ with ऋषिs, but differing with
    an आचार्य is as old as the आचार्यs themselves.  
-   There are multiple traditional versions in this case too. Several
    publications of शुक्लयजुर्वेदसंहिता and सर्वानुकमणी published in
    Surat and Varanasi in late 19th century take ईशावास्यम् printed as
    समस्तपद. I can give references if needed. If a प्रस्थानत्रयीभाष्यकार
    like मध्वाचार्य or रामभद्राचार्य disagree with \[a version of\]
    पदपाठ then it is a simple case of an आचार्य disagreeing with a
    former आचार्य - there is nothing more to it and it should not be
    taken personally.
