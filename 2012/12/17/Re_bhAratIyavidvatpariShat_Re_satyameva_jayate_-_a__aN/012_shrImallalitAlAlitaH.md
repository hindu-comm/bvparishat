I was not interpreting your stand. I was neutral as you could see. I've marked two options.  
I didn't say that I know what veda-pAThin-s say about जयते or जयति . So, it was just a stand of a neutral man.  
But, if you could smell some amount of inclination towards veda-pAThin-s, that was wished to be shown. We, who do not practice veda-pATha as our main duty, are no one to decide the thing. We rely on other people for that.

It was witty and used to show inclination towards veda-pAThin-s. No insult of vaiyAkaraNa-s. But, clearly I'm not standing with vaiyAkaraNa-s whenever veda-s come as opposition.  
Knowledge of and inclination towards vyAkaraNa shAstra of members of this group is inspiration for many. No one can negate this.

They may not be same in all aspects but as a difference they are same.

I don't have so much faith in printed matter for this reason only. They differ. This makes all of them subject to doubt. We have to ask veda-pAThin-s or we have to search for commentaries on them.  
Once we find them, we will be able to decide the correct version.  
That much for all this thread.  
  
To add,  
I maintain that it is quite difficult to decide everything about past things and events. So, we just assume some rules and run to decide everything in order to run our vyavahAra. If we ever try to decide with neutral mind which questions everything, it will become very difficult to decide that.
