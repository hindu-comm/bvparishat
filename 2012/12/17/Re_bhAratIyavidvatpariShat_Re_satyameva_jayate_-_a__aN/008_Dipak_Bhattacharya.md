\<It is really sad that the Government logo was not corrected by Sanskritajnas>  

A traditionally accepted ie authentic Vedic form can by no means be called incorrect. To say the least this accusation is preposterous. The deficiency is then of grammar not of the Vedas. The Vedas were not composed after the grammatical texts. The latter were composed after the Vedas.

I have the same issue as Narsing Rao ji. It is really sad that the Government logo was not corrected by Sanskritajnas.. The same is true for ’अतिथि देवो भवः’ which should actually read 'अतिथिर्देवो भव’.



Time Sanskritajnas got involved with the government??



Uttara.
