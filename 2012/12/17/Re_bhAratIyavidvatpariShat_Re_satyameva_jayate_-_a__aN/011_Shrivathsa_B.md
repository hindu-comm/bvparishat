hariH OM,  
nityAnand,

  
  
"There are multiple traditional versions in this case too. Several publications of शुक्लयजुर्वेदसंहिता and सर्वानुकमणी published in Surat and Varanasi in late 19th century take ईशावास्यम् printed as समस्तपद. I can give references if needed."  

 Please provide your references.  
 The Vedic Word index of Vishvabandhu Shastri (Shantikuti Vedic Series in 15 parts, published by Vishveshvaranand Vishvabandhu Research Institute, Hoshiarpur, Punjab). Vishvabandhu Shastri needs no introduction and hence i will not even try. In this word index, i.e. Shantikuti Vedic Series Part VI, or Vedic Word Index Volume 1, Part 2, Page 856, you find the entry for the mAdhyandina mantra, which is 40, 1; The entry also lists it as in kANva samhitA 40,1, 1. The entry is "iishA" and not "iishAvAsyaM" as you claim.

  
  
"The comparison is far-fetched. Discussing two versions of संहितापाठ (सत्यमेव जयति/सत्यमेव जयते) is not same as agreeing/disagreeing with a पदपाठ. संहितापाठ is pure पाठ by a ऋषि मन्त्रद्रष्टा whereas पदपाठ is an analysis (one out of 11 "विकृति"पाठs of वाक्यपाठ, पदपाठ, क्रमपाठ, जटापाठ, मालापाठ, शिखापाठ, रेखापाठ, ध्वजपाठ, दण्डपाठ, रथपाठ, and घनपाठ) by an आचार्य using व्याकरण to analyze the संहिता."  
  

 All the higher vikR^itis (krama, jaTA etc.) proceed from the pada. Hence your above statement is not accurate. In tradition, padapAThakAras have been given quite a high status. May be not the status of draShTR^is themselves, but quite higher than AcAryas etc.  
  
 A person who doesn't agree with a certain padacCheda is free to make a padapATha which fits the samhitA in question as a whole and it is not appropriate to cherry-pick those instances where he perceives the padapAThakAra has gone "wrong". Moreover, in tradition, R^igveda padapAThakAra pre-dates pANinii, I don't know about other vedas.  
  
svasti,  
 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,  

shrivathsa.
