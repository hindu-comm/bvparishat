This is quite true. I was planning to post something on this line. Let it be the oppurtunity ....  
First of all we have to ask reciters of veda-s, veda-pAThin-s, for the traditional pATha and then if जयते comes as traditionally accepted one we will have to close arguments based on vyAkaraNa because vyAkaraNa is not always a scale for vaidika usage.  
If it is not, then let the vyAkaraNa come to take the credit.  
  
But, even then someone may come and say that he doesn't care veda-pAThin-s as was said once in case of ईशा वास्यम् the pada-pATha. Then for such inclined people, vyAkaraNa is always preferred.
