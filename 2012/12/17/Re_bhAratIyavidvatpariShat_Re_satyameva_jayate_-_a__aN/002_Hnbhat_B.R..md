I don't know about theSanskritajna-s who had accepted it without correction.

  

But I know this is not a forum to discuss the Political issues and anymore such attempt will be viewed seriously. Mod. Note.

The above is a strange sentence by theSanskritajnas involved so?

WhichSanskritajna-s made the above statement that the first statement is correct and the second is the actual reading? I don't know in which government theSanskritajna-s are involved. I think it may be the same Government, which approved as सत्यमेव जयते emblem, as found in some versions of the Upanishad-s at least. These two sentences are never met in any occasion.

  

  

According to my knowledge, both the sentences are wrong and nonsensical. Before criticizing others, please take care yourself don't commit the same mistake. This is an advice as a fellow member of the forum. I am seeing your first post in the forum.

  

Better to avoid criticizing political policies in the forum which is not within the scope of the objectives of the forum according to the recent FAQ already published in draft forum at least. To emphasis this only I have approved this posting with my reply immediately.
