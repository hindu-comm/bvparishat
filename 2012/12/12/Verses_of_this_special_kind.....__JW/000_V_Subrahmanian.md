Namaste  
  
In the following two verses there is a pun with the words/sounds 'मे’ and ’धिक् तान्’. The sound by itself would not yield any meaning but the poet looks at them as valid words and intelligently uses them. I would like to hear more verses of this kind from learned members here so that a collection thereof could be the outcome:  
  
दारा इमे मे तनया इमे मे गृहा इमे मे पशवश्च मे मे ।  
इत्थं नरो मेषसमानधर्मा मेमेकरः कालवृकेण नीतः ॥  
  
येषां श्रीमद्यशोदासुतपदकमले नास्ति भक्तिर्नराणां  
येषामाभीरकन्याप्रियगुणकथने नानुरक्ता रसज्ञा \|  
येषां श्रीकृष्णलीलाललितरसकथासादरौ नैव कर्णौ  
धिक् तान् धिक् तान् धिगेतान् कथयति सततं कीर्तनस्थो मृदङ्गः \|\|  
  
Also, kindly cite the definite source of the above verses as different sources are found to be ascribed to them.
