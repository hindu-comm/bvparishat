Sir, could you kindly announce the other program 'लेखनप्रशिक्षणशिबिरम्’ coming up at Sringeri, conducted by the RSSansthan from 27.5.2012 to 6.6.2012? Since I do not have the scanning facility I am making this request. The announcement is in the inner back cover of the April 2012 issue of सम्भाषणसन्देशः.  
  
Many useful courses/short-courses are being conducted by the RSS. If there is a method by which such announcements are made directly by the RSS on the BVP it can have a wide viewership.  
  
Regards,
