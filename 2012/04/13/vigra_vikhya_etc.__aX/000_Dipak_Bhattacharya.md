13.4.12

Dear Colleagues,

Bhanuji Dīkṣita, Vyākhyāsudhā on Amarakoṣa 2.6.46 *vigras tu gatanāsike* cites *vikhya* as from Vārtika on P.5.4.119 and informs *vigro vikhur vināsikaḥ iti rabhasaḥ.* He has another information *khukhrau iti Sākaṭāyanaḥ*. The aim is to state the correctness of the forms *vigra, vikhya,vikhu, vikhra*/*vikha* all formed from *vi*+*nas* and explain their meaning.

A few questions naturally rise.



1. Has anybody seen the employment of the word *vikhya* in Sanskrit outside lexicon?

2. Where does Śākaṭāyana sanction *khu* and *khra* or *kha* replacing –**nas** after *vi* as reported by Bhānuji?

3. Again, where does Rabhasa(nandī?) gloss on *vigra* and *vikhu*?

4. Could anyone inform of any modern study on the words mentioned that is *vigra*, *vikhya,vikhu*,*vikha* etc?



Best
