Namaste.  
  
Here is a line from a shloka where the word प्रथते appears:  
  
सकृत्संवादेऽपि प्रथत इह चामुत्र च फलम्  
  
The meaning I have is: Even a single conversation (with a mahAtmA) yields fruits here and in the world attained after death.  
  
My doubt is: In the shloka should the word 'संवादेऽपि’ be 'संवादोऽपि’ in order to be in tune with the English meaning?  
In other words does the word 'prathate' (verb) remain unchanged whether it is संवादेऽपि’ OR 'संवादोऽपि ?  
  
Is the word 'prathate' in Atmanepadi or parasmaipadi?  
  
Kindly clear my doubt with respect to all the aspects above. Any extra information/clarification that I have not sought for, but relevant to my question is also welcome.
