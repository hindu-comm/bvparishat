प्रथ प्रख्याने is the root. It belongs to the first class (भ्वादयः)  
and indeed takes aatmanepadee terminations. It has the meanings "to  
become famous", "to increase", and "to rise". The particular sloka,  
SikhariNI, in full is:

तमांसि ध्वंसन्ते परिणमति भूयानुपशमः  
सकृत्संवादेऽपि प्रथत इह चामुत्र च शुभम् ।  
अथ प्रत्यासङ्गः कमपि महिमानं वितरति  
प्रसन्नानां वाचः फलमपरिमेयं प्रसुवते ॥ 12 ॥ from the first act of  
the play, Mahaviracharitam of Bhavabhuti.

The context is that Visvamitra invites King Janaka to his ASrama.  
Janaka being engaged in a sacrifice, sends his brother KuSadhvaja  
along with Sita and Urmila to Visvamitra's hermitage. The above sloka  
is said by the King in the very opening scene as the chariot  
approaches the hermitage after describing the sages as  
"साक्षात्कृतब्रह्माणो महर्षयः।".

Pl note the word Subham in the place of 'phalam' in the fragment sent by you.

Now for the meaning, and why संवादे is correct and not संवादः.

As per you understanding the core of the sentence ought to be  
सकृत्संवादः अपि फलं (शुभं) प्रथते। i.e. samvaadah is the kartaa and  
phalam is the karma. If that were indeed the intent, a better usage  
would be प्रथयति as प्रथ प्रख्याने is also read in the tenth class  
(चुरादयः).

However if you take the Sloka as a whole, in the first half (the  
second half is separate), there are three clauses, all of which result  
from sakrit-samvaada, or 'in one conversation' following the idiom of  
Sanskrit. What are those?

a\) tamaamsi dhvamsante (the darknesses \[i.e. ajnaanas or ignorances of  
various types\] perish; note the plurality of the kartaa)  
b) bhooyaan upaSamah pariNamati (a great calmness transforms, i.e.  
manas becomes tranquil)  
c) Subham pratathe, iha ca amutra ca (auspiciousness rises or  
increases, here and there (i.e. in oordhva lokas)

So, here Subham or Phalam is the karta. All these things happen 'in  
even one conversation' सकृत्संवादेऽपि.

The appropriateness of prathate in the context cannot be  
over-emphasised. Indeed even one audience with  
saakshaatkritabrahmaaNah will indeed increase, rise and spread one's  
Subham both here and there.

This also shows how works of great poets do not tolerate change of  
even one letter!
