Dear Sri Sadasiva Murty Garu!

  

-   Atiraatra is one of the 7 Variants of Somayaagas. (Sapta Soma
    Samstha).  
-   Anyone can perform is in the sequential order; Agnishtoma,
    Atyagnishtoma, Ukthya, Atiraatra, Aptoryaama, Vaajapeya, Poundareeka
    ... thus goes the list.  
-   Going by your sentence quoting Wiki, that it is confined to
    Samavedis of Kerala; the fear of BVK Sastry, seems to come true. If
    scholars like most of us are misled by some half baked information
    provided on Wiki, which is never authenticated; anyone can be
    carried/ swayed over by the info from internet. We should speed up
    the compilation of basic information.

Jaya Guru Datta
