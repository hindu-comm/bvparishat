Namaste,  
Yagna & Yaaga are different. Yaaga doesnt has predefined set  
of rules. Just some guidelines about yaga will be there. The  
Nirdheshaka has to be well versed in Yaaga Sutras which requires  
hundreds of years of Chaturveda Adhyayana, Tantra Sutra perfection,  
study the reports of previous Yaagas that has been Earthed after  
completion of Yaaga.  
More on the yaagas:  
  
<http://veda-vijnana.blogspot.in/2012/03/yagna-yaaga-sutras-part-1.html>  
(More about Atiratra is to be continued in next part of the post)  
  
Atiraatra is one among the 7 Soma Yaagas. Its not a name of single  
Yaaga. There are several types of Atiraatras. It has to be performed  
over night. So usually Atiraatra Yaagas have the rituals covering  
whole day & night for several days to months according to the Yaaga  
Samyojana Vidhi.  
  
Atiraatra Vidhi has been formulated by Manduka Rushis, its difficult  
to write about the procedure here.  
  
Yaaga procedure is not confined to any region, sect, or individual.  
But it can be performed only by great enlightened Saadhakas. Yaaga is  
not a kid play. A small irresponsibility will adversely affect the  
nature as it will be dealing with the core elements of nature.
