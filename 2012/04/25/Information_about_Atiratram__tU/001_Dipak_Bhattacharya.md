Dear Dr. rani,

I am no learned scholar in Vedic ritual. But it was compulsory for many like me to know the preliminaries of the Vedic sacrifice both at home and the University. But I caution that I did not make any special research on Vedic sacrifice excepting on the Agnyādheya and its closely related Tantric and Buddhist variations.

It was learned at home that there are seven saṃsthās of the somayāgas -- agniṣṭoma, atyaginiṣṭoma, ukthya, ṣoḍaśī, vājapeya, atirātra and aptor yāma. There are 25 śastras and stotras in the atirātra, an ekāha somasaṃsthā, the 6^(th) in the order of counting. So much my home learning. Later Paṭṭābhirāma Śāstrī confirmed this at the university, but his order varied. Details available in the History of Dharmaśāstra II, ŚB.41.17---, Ap. Ś. Sūtra 14.3 etc vary between themselves in detail. A close-fitting lucid description will be found also in Cinnasvāmī Śāstī’s Yajñatattvaprakāśa but its reading must be preceded by that of the first saṃsthā that is Agniṣṭoma on which the Atirātra is modeled.

Does this help?

Best
