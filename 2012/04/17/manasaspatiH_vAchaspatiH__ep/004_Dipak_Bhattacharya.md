Dear Dr. Narayanan,  

It does not differ. *bṛhaspati* and *vācaspati* are similarly formed.

If it is just a question of a sanctioning authority from among the Munitraya, Patañjali himself uses the word *bṛhaspati*

***brhaspatir indrāya divyavarṣasahasraṃ pratipadoktānāṃ śabdānāṃ śabdapārāyaṇaṃ provāca nāntaṃ jagāma*.Paspaśāhnika. **

Now, *yathottaraṃ munīnāṃ prāmāṇyam*. Hence traditionalists should not hesitate to accept it as Pāṇinian.

Not all forms can be shown to have been formed strictly according to Pāṇinian rules. *Samrājñī* is an example. According to rules it may be *samrājī* or *saṃrājñī*. An invitee in a marriage sabhā at Varanasi had questioned the propriety of the word *samrājñī* used in the invitation card by the family of the groom. The chief among the groom’s party (T.C.Sāhityācārya) cited Vedic usage and the non-employment of the sanctioned forms in Classical Sanskrit. I know of this event from authentic sources. Should we not follow this example in usage?

Best
