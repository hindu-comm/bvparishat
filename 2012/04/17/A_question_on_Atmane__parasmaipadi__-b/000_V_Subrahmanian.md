Namaste.  
  
I am giving expression to my thinking which I request the esteemed scholars here to examine:  
  
In English we have these two types of verbs: transitive and intransitive:  
  
The boy kicked the ball: here the action of kicking passes from the boy, the subject, to the ball, the object.  
The boy weeps: Here the action of weeping does not pass on to any object outside the boy, the subject.  
  
The former sentence is said to contain a 'transitive verb' and the latter, an 'intransitive verb.'  
  
Now, in Sanskrit: बालः फलं खादति :Here the action of eating passes from the boy to the fruit.  
बालः रोदिति : Here the action 'crying' does not pass to anything outside the boy.  
  
My question is: Is there the 'parasmaipadi' verb in the first sentence and the 'Atmanepadi' in the second sentence?  
  
Is it possible to say the parasmaipadi is equivalent to the English 'transitive verb' and the atmanepadi is corresponding to the 'intransitive verb'?  
  
I request the scholars to kindly forgive me if the question is irrelevant/inappropriate/totally meaningless.  
  
Regards,
