Dear Scholars!



I am looking for a book titled ‘yajnopavita mimamsa” by Mahavidvan Sri. U. Ve. Taiyar Ammalacharya Swami, published in early 20^(th) century \[1914\].



While searching in google, I got a entry of a book with the same name by one Sri Visvanatha Sastri published in 1938 from national Library collection of GoI.

\[Call no. 181, Lc. 93. 57\]. Is there a way of getting a copy, electronic or otherwise, of the same?



Request if any scholar could throw light on these and any more sources/texts on this issue?



Thanks and regards



Ramanujan
