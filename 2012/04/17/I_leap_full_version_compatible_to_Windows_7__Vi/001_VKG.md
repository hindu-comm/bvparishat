Dear Sadasiva Murty garu!

  

Ileap development is stopped in 2001/ 2002. They are not bringing out any new versions. And the entire team is disbanded/ disintegrated. No new product is expected in near future.

  

By the way, with the integrated Unicode Key Board facility, we do not require ILEAP. Just enable the option of key board, you can type languages in any application.

  

But only hitch is that, you have to learn inscript keyboard layout in typing. Phonetic option is not provided.

Rest all fine.
