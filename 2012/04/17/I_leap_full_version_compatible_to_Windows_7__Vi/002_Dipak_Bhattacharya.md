New iLEAP-type systems like Lipikar, Srilipi etc are available. But they have the same disadvantage as that of iLEAP. Apart from the Unicode compliant keyboard that can be activated for any language through the Region and Language icon at the Control Panel, Baraha and iTranslator also may work. iTranslator is often troublesome. Baraha is available at a price.
