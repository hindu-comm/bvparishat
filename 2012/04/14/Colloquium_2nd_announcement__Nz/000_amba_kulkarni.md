**A two day Colloquium to mark the 25 years of NLP research in India with**

**Pāṇinian Perspective**

The NLP activities in India and Sanskrit studies took a new direction some 25 years back when the Sanskrit scholars and the Computer Scientists joined hands and started working together with a common goal of building a Machine Translation systems. During this process, many linguists joined the main stream of NLP research, the community grew, the research areas broadened both in quality and the quantity.

Prof. K.V.Ramakrishnamacharyulu, a founding member of this community joined this team with his treasure of Sanskrit grammar. With a vision to open new vistas and an open mindedness to adapt to the new challanges, he made important contributions to the establishment and growth of a new discipline and also created confidence among the NLP researchers for the application of the Indian grammatical tradition to the emerging technologies. He is one of the key members of the Akshar Bharati group and has contributed directly to the development of various computational tools for Indian languages. He was instrumental in providing guidelines for developing annotation schemes for Sanskrit and Hindi (which are being extended to other Indian Languages as well) following Paninian Grammar.

Interestingly, Prof. K.V.Ramakrishnamacharyulu attains 65 years at a time which coincides with the 25 years of NLP activities in India. On this occasion a 2 day colloquium is being organised jointly by Department of Sanskrit Studies and Center for Applied Linguistics and Translation Studies, University of Hyderabad **on 2^(nd) and 3^(rd) August, 2012.**
