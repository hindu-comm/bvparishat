Dear all,  
I need a small info please,  
In sabdakalpadruma a kosa is quoted often "jatadharacharya" (paryaya  
nanartha kosa), is that printed before ? if not manuscripts are  
available and where? As Mr, narayanan er informed me, 'The  
lexicographer Jaṭādhara is belonging to caṭugrāma according to M.M.  
Williams" would like to know much more about the same  
  
Thank you
