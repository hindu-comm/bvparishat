Respected Scholars,  
  
Namaste.  
I was just wondering what was the first ever English translation of a Sanskrit book by a western scholar.  
A page from Wiki says -  
  
"The study of Sanskrit in the Western world began in the 17th century. Some of Bhartṛhari's poems were translated into Portuguese in 1651. In 1779 a legal code known as vivādārṇavasetu was translated by Nathaniel Brassey Halhed from a Persian translation, and published as A Code of Gentoo Laws." (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit_in_the_West>)  
  
Would you endorse it?  
  
Thanks and regards,  
Prasad
