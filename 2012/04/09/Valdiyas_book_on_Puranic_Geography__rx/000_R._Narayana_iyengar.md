Dear Members,  
Prof.Valdiya the famous geologist now settled in Bangalore has written  
an interesting book  
"Geography, Peoples,And Geodynamics of India in Purana and Epics".  
Publ. Aryan Books, NDelhi, 2012(Rs. 500/= Libr.Edn.Rs1500/-).

It is an easily readable book, illustrated very well in colour.It is  
a goodreference on the social and geographical relevance of Puranas  
for the contemporary society. Such a book wasexpected by many like me  
and Valdiya has eminently fufilled thewish ofhis admirers. After the  
book by S.M.Ali on Puranic Geography, I had not seen a book of this  
type written by an academic scholar.

Apart from the geological/geographical synthesis of varied Sanskrit  
texts (dispersed in hundred places) which only ageo-scientist like  
him could do,personally Iam impressed withhis love for  
Bhaarata-varsha.His frequent references to greater India and  
pre-independence India is very apt. Iwishthis book will provokethe  
younger generationtoexperiencea sense of loss for the vibrant  
Puranic-India that was senselessly partitioned.

I have attached a few pages from the book for information.
