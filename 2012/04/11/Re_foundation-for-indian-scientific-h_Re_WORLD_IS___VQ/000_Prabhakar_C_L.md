\> Rig Veda hymn (11-164-20) which says that two birds are

\> same time Vedic rishies declared that physical enjoyment of  
\> worldly things and use of money should be with a feeling of  
\> renunciation 'Tain taktain bhunjitha'  
\> (Yajur Veda 40.6). It implies that money should not  
\> become the be-all and end-all of human lifesince  
\> remainingimmersed in the blind pursuit of wealth
