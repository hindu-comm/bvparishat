Respected Scholars,  
  
It is true that the animals do not have the perception on the importance of intellectual qualities of human beings when they hunt their food. Here is a verse being heard from the Pancatantra:  
  
सिंहो व्याकरणस्य कर्तुरहरत् प्राणान् प्रियान् पाणिने-

र्मीमांसाकृतमुन्ममाथ सहसा हस्ती मुनिं जैमिनिम्‌।  
छन्दोज्ञाननिधिं जघान मकरो वेलातटे पिङ्गलं  

ह्यज्ञानावृतचेतसामतिरुषां कोऽर्थस्तिरश्चां गुणैः॥ (पञ्चतन्त्रम्- २.३५)  
  
I would like to know that is there any historical evidence or not for such type of highlights on Panini, Jaimini and Pingala etc. were hunted by animals, with a view to establishing that what cruel and ignorant animals have to do with the qualities. Please share the views.  
Regards,  
Narayanan
