Here is a tribute, from a non-scholar, to the Great Indian Epics:

Ms.P.T.Usha, the renowned athlete of India, said this in response to questions:  
(excerpts)  

**Who are your favourite authors?**

I cannot think of anyone beyond Ved Vyas. For me *The Mahabharatha* is the greatest literary work ever written.

**Who is your favourite hero of fiction?**

The Ramayana is another work that has deeply influenced me. One of my favourite characters is Hanuman. It is because he symbolises speed and loyalty. I have always believed that loyalty is a quality that should exist in human beings.

(end of excerpts)

We can see how these two great works have remained alive to the present day in the minds of people, the lay and the laity. It would not be wrong to say that the great Kavi-s of India have been inspired by these two works in some or large measure and produced their works of undoubted genius.
