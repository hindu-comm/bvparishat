The above verse is from सरस्वतीरहस्योपनिषत् .. as given in Sanskritdocuments list:

  

<http://sanskritdocuments.org/all_sa/sarasrah_sa.html>  

  

which appears as the benedictory verse of काव्यादर्श of दण्डिन् without any change and this is confirmed by a later women poetess as कुवलयदलश्यामां विज्जिकां मामजानता। वृथैव दण्डिना प्रोक्ता सर्वशुक्ला सरस्वती। as I have read somewhere as the verse of Vijjaka or Vijjika. (right now I could not provide the source) though there are references to this poetess in sec.374 of History of Classical Literature. 

  

Does this mean दण्डिन् borrowed this benedictory verse from the उपनिषत् or the उपनिषत् is of a latter composition than काव्यादर्श?

  

Revered Scholars are requested discuss this point if interesting. Otherwise please ignore this request.
