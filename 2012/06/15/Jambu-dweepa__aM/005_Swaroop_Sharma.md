Namaskara

  

DhanyavaadaaH to Ajit-ji :-)

What is the significance of these seven divisions of the of the world? As we during our Sankalpa say Jampbudweepe Etc., is there a place somewhere on earth, wherein during Sankalpa, we can use other names of the remaining six Dweepas? Can you help me by enlisting the names of the other Varshas, in case it is readily available? I am curious to know the structure or the kind ofgeographical imagination our ancestors had :-)
