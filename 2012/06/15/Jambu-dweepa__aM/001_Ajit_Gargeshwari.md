The puranas have divided the world into seven part called Dvipas and Jambudvipa is the first and the foremost which again divided into nine sub parts called Varshas. Of the nine Varshas Ilavrritta is the main sub part. South Ilavrritta and beyond the Himalayas is situated the Bhartavarsha. Bhartavarsha is again divided into nine parts. Among the nine parts Kumaradvipa is India proper. It is said to extend from Kumari ie. Kanya Kumari in the south to Gangas in the north. Possibly other subdivision represented Islands in Indonasia, Indo-China and Srilanka. Accordingly Bhartavarsha seems to have represented Graeter Indian than Proper India.  
  
One can also see Naishdhiya charita 1.5 and Bhagavata Purana 5.1.32  
One can read Indian and Jambu Island by Amarnath Das.

Slightly varying accounts are given in different Puranas such as Matsya, Brahma, Vishnu punana etc.  
  
In Buddhist literature Indian has been called Jambudvipa and portions of it Aryadesha and Madhyadesha. One of the other names found in Buddhist literature is Indravardhana (On Yuan Chwang Travels in India) but the name doesn't appear to be popular as no puranic literature supports such a view.  
  
Jambudviapa is one of the four Mahadipas or great continents included in the Chakkvati and are ruled by Chakkavati. They are grouped around Mount Sineru. In Jambudvipa is Himavat with its 84,00 peaks, it lake mountain etc The continent derives it name from Jambu tree also called Naga which grows there. It is said that the Buddhas and Chakkavati's are born in Jambudvipa as opposed to Sikaladipa. Jambudvipa indicated the sub continent of India.  
  
Bharatavarsha according to Jaina traditions is one of the several regions situated in the Jambu divva and also know as Bharath or Baraha;
whereas according to Buddhist tradition Jambudvipa was synonymous to Bhartavarsha.
