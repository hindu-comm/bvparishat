The puranas have divided the world into seven part called Dvipas and Jambudvipa is the first and the foremost which again divided into nine sub parts called Varshas.

  
The seven Dvipas are Plaksa , Salmala, Kusa ,Kraucha,Jambu Saka and Puskara  
  
The varshas are also named as Ketumal, bhadravarsha, Kuru Hirnmaya, Ramyaka, Ilavrata, Hari, Kimpurusha and Bharatavarsha  

  
Bharath Varshas is divided into nine parts Indradvipa, Kasaru (or Kaseruman), Namraparva (or tamravarna, Tamrapani, Tamradvipa), Gabhistiman, Nagadvipa Samaya or (Krtahatia), Gandharva, Or Sinhala(ceylon), Varuna and Kumaradvipa or Kumaridvipa.  
  
**Please refer to different Puranas for different classification and naming methods.**  
  
According to Jainism the names of the eight continents starting from Jambudvipa outwards Jambudvipa, Dhataki, Pushkarvara, Varunivara, Kshiravara, Grhitavara, Ikshuvara and Nandiswara

Is there a place somewhere on earth, wherein during Sankalpa, we can use other names of the remaining six Dweepas?  
  
I don't wish to comment on this  
  
As to the significance if one reads the puranas it will become quite clear
