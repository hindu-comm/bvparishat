Jambudweepa is entire Eurasia.  
Starting from Bharatavarsha in the south it extends upto Uttarakuru in the north and from Ketumal in the west of Ilavrita, it extends upto Bhadrashva in the east.  
It's like in ascending order a rainbow shaped Varsha that makes up the entire dweepa.  
Bharata, Kimpurusha, Hari, Ilavrita. West of Ilavrita (probably Ilavrita is modern day mongolia, as Ilavrit is the centre of jambudweepa) - Ketumala. and east of Ilavrita is Bhadrashva. Ketumal is modern day Europe.  
North of Ilavrita is Ramyaka, Hiranmaya and Uttarakuru.

Shalmala is central and northen africa - as its on west if Jambudweepa. I'm certain because in The Garga Samhita, when sage Pulatsya brings Drona's son Govardhan to Vraj, he brings him from Shalmala Dweepa, which lies in the west.

Plaksha is South Africa as it means peepal and south of africa has plaksha trees.

Shaka is Australia newzealand etc. As shaka means pine tree and there is abundance of pine in Aus.

Pushkara - maple tree is North America.

Kusha and Krauncha, I'm not sure of. Maybe Krauncha can be related to Kartikeya/Parashurama somehow. And it's probably North America and Pushkars can be south of it.

I'm really not sure of how it would work.  
This is a question that has tormented me alot.
