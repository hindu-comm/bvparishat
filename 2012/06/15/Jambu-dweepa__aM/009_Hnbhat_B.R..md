Here is one more reference wep page:

  

<http://shiva.iiit.ac.in/SabdaSaarasvataSarvasvam/index.php/%E0%A4%B5%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B7%E0%A4%AE%E0%A5%8D>

  
to the concept of वर्ष-s.

  

To the question of Swaroop, the answer is dependent on whether one takes the geographical description of वर्ष-s as realistic and corresponding to the modern geographic google world map or with the identified continents today or consider them as fancy imaginary description. 

  

I also agree with Ajith's answer and opt not to comment on it.
