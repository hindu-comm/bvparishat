Here is one result:  
<http://www26.us.archive.org/stream/travancorearchae014361mbp/travancorearchae014361mbp_djvu.txt>  
  
In the above page, under J you can find this work listed as no.102.  
  
In this following book I think you can locate the stotra. You will have to do some search here:  
  
<http://www26.us.archive.org/stream/travancorearchae014361mbp#page/n111/mode/2up>  
  
Maybe some member can help search it here.  
  
  
If I get further details about the work itself I shall post here.
