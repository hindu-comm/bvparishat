Thank you very much Prof. D.Bhattacharya and Dr. H.N. Bhat for your precise reply for my question on "Ooha".

Thanks to Shivsenani. Please note that along with "pratIta-padArthaka", there is another word "Sampratyaya.



"Now I came across the word UpAdAna shabda and different books translate differently in English. I know the phrases upAdAna kAraNa and Nimitta kAraNa.



Also the word PraNava is used for "OmkArA' , the ekAks'ara Brahma. Now what is the etymology of the word PraNava? Late Meher Baba from India in his book, "God speaks" says "Om' is the creation point through which shadow of nothingness (perhaps MAYA) oozed out. In short God pulls himself in and creates vacuum. This idea of creation is present in many other religions also, Now how did Indian philosophers coined this word PraNava for Omkar? It is also nowadays discussed that there exist many parallel universes. If it is true, does that mean do we have new (Pra+nava -new, I may be wrong) creation point for each of them. For this purpose I am asking etymology of PraNava. Thanks to all again. N.R.Joshi.
