Dear Colleagues,

It was Rāmacandra who wrote the Prakriyākaumudī setting the model for an Aṣṭādhyāyī rearranged according to prakriyā. Bhaṭṭoji imitated him in bringing out a more complete edition. That was a good task. But, with all respect to the savant, it has always appeared to me that Bhaṭṭoji could have been generous in admitting his debt to the pioneer and his प्रगुरु Rāmacandra. There is no such admission in the Siddhāntakaumudī where it was expected. On the contrary Bhaṭṭoji seems to have sometimes adversely referred to Rāmacandra’s views as इति केचित् । I may deal with this aspect of the grammarian later.

Best
