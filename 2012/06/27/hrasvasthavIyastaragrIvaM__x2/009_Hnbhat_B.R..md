I think we forgot one thing mainly. Narayana Bhatta, wrote प्रक्रियाकौमुदी himself either contemporary to सिद्धान्तकौमुदी, a little later or earlier. I am not sure. It is said Bhattoji heard of Narayana Bhatta's work and was willing to set out to meet him personally hearing of his novel work. But unfortunately by that time Narayana Bhatta passed away and they could not meet. I am not saying this legend need be a true report, but the possibility of both the works being written independent of each other at the same time. Now quoting बृहच्छब्देन्दुशेखर a later commentary on सिद्धान्तकौमुदी, either by Haridikshita or Nagoji Bhatta himself, does not seem to justify the correctness of the usage of the author of प्रक्रियाकौमुदी. It justifies श्रेष्ठतमाय etc. usages as छान्दस but Narayana Bhatta had a different view on this point. We forgot to consult his own grammar on this question. Here I got this कारिका either composed by himself or borrowed from earlier writers.

  

घौ पुनरिष्ठेमेयसोरिष्टौ श्रेष्ठतरो युधिष्ठिरः।

स्वार्थेऽपि च घौ वाच्यावल्पाच्तरमप्यभिन्नतमम्।।

  

अल्पाच्तरम् had been commented as अल्पाच् एव अल्पाच्तरम् as स्वार्थिक suffix in the Panini's rule.

(under इष्ठस्य यिट् च ६.४.१५९)

and considers other suffixes also on the same line:

  

स्वार्थस्यैव भिषक्त्वादेः कुत्सादौ प्रत्यया मताः।+

भिषग्रूपो भिषक्पाशो नान्यैर्दोषगुणैर्भवेत्॥

  

नामजात्योः पुनः स्वार्थे स्तुतिनिन्दाद्यसंभवात्।

तद्धर्मैः स्याद् देवदत्तपाशः सिंहतमस्तथा॥

(under प्रशंसायां रूपप् ५.३.६६)

  

अप्रशस्तत्वेऽपि स्वार्थे पूर्णत्वे रूपप् स्यात् - दस्युतमः।

(Part III, p.193, of Prakriyasarvasva).

  

Now ह्रस्वस्थवीयस्तर was considered as स्वार्थे घ by Narayanabhatta himself which means he didn't consider the view being छान्दस for the usages he found. in Epic literature.

  

The rest is left for arbitration.

  

With regards and thanks to all who contributed this topic.
