Respected Sir,  
1. Vacaka is the sound having the combination of root and affix (etymological) which coveys the meaning to listener. For instance: when "gau" is heard, a meaning of a particular animal called cow/bull (both) is revealed to the listener. The Kavyaprakasha says: साक्षात् सङ्केतितं योऽर्थमभिधत्ते स वाचकः॥ Here abhidha is the primary and vital process for the fundamental meaning from sound. Sanketa is the fundamental meaning processed through abhidha from the sound.  
2. Dyotaka is the sound which conveys the meaning to listener other than the fundamental meaning, depending upon many a number of circumstances, like relational context, presence of other sound-meaning etc. For instance: when "Rama" is heard, that Rama could be Dasharatha's elder son, Jamadagni's fourth son or even Rohini's son too. The fundamental and etymological meaning of Rama could be something else. So the presence of adjectives like Dasharathi, Jamadagnya, Rauhineya make the distinction. Dyotaka is the sound which is Denotive sound or Indicative sound.  
3. Jnapaka is the sound which conveys the informative/ designing meaning to listener other than the fundamental meaning. For instance: when a man is called "chunky" or "bulky" the informative meaning revealed (confirmed meaning by simple guess) could be: "one eats a lot" "one is lazy", "one is ill of obeisity" "one is slow moving" etc. Here the fundamental meaning is only "fatman."  
Regarding the dyotakatva and the vacakatva of the prepositions and particles, there are debates in literature. There we read a discussion in the Mahabhashaya, vide: rule: 1:3:1 regarding this topic. In a usage like: prapacati (one cooks well), the action pacati indicates generalized activity of cooking. The speciality of individualism in cooking plus the generalized activity of cooking are provided by the preposition "pra" by joining with "pacati". Here Patanjali says: व्यवहारस्तु सङ्घातेनार्थगतेः। (The meaning revealed of both meanings (of pra and pac) clubbed up).  
Regards,
