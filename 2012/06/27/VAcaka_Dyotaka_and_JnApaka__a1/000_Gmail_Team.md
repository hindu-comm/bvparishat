Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



Sanskrit shabdas are either VAcaka, or Dyotaka or JnApaka



What is the difference between Dyotaka and JnApaka. Could please illustrate with examples?



Some scholars believe that NipAtas and Upasargas are VAcaka. Other believe they are Dyotaka. How to decide the difference. Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
