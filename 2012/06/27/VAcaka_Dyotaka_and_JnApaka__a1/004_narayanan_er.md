Respected Sir,

There are quite a few competent scholars in this group to answer this. Still I try a few lines within the limit of my capacity.  

Vaacaka is equivalent in Sahitya too as it is in Vyakarana. Laakshanika is when the vaacakatva (popular or etymological meaningfulness) is challenged due to conventions or due to some beneficial aspects and the sound becomes Laakshanika to have its particular target. Famous example is "gangaayaam ghoshah."

In the Mahabhashya we see quite a few times as Patanjali says: आचार्यप्रवृत्तिर्ज्ञापयति, etc. where we hear about the Jnaapakas.

Terms like Dyotaka, Vyanjaka, Pratyaayaka etc. are used with the same intent as the sound signifies some signified meaning (or many signified meanings) other than that of its Vaacaka. Eg. लीलाकमलपत्राणि गणयामास पार्वती। Here the meaning of counting of lotus is not intendedin a particular circumstance; but the meaning signified here is the sentiment of shyness of Parvati, while she stands along with her father Himavat when she heard from Narada about supernatural qualities of Siva. This meaning is signified but not literal.  

The we see what the taatparya is. It is process called taatparyashakti from a tatpara sound to have a taatparya meaning. The Bhashapariccheda says:

आकाङ्क्षा वक्तुरिच्छा तु तात्पर्यं परिकीर्तितम्॥

The rhetoricians define it as :

प्रधानमुपकार्योऽर्थः पदार्था ह्युपकारकाः।

तत्परत्वं पदार्थानां तात्पर्यं तदुदीरितम्।।

So, it is very much clear from this, as where to the meaning is inclined to. The importance of the meaning targeted is fully dependent upon the circumstances, whereas the literal meaning is sidelined or totally neglected. The rhetoricians who follow the Mimamsa system like Dhanika, Dhananjaya etc. have hooked their horns with the Dhvani school of Anandavardhana and they argued that the taatparyashakti can provide aesthetic beauty by substituting the vyanjanaashakti.  

The taatparyashakti for Kaavyarasa was also under discussion during Mammata's period too. He says: तात्पर्यार्थोऽपि केषुचित्।

I am aware that these hints are not sufficient in this regard. Let us expect more comments with authority in this regard.  

Regards,

Narayanan
