\> June 16,212 Respected scholars, Namasjkar! Meaning of Sansktit prefix 'Nir' or 'Nis' I am puzzled with meanings of words starting with these two prefixes in Sanskrit (1) What is the difference between Nirmanthana and Manthan?(2)-----between Nirdish and Dish(3) ----between Nirghan'Ta and Ghan'Ta(4) -----between NirmANa and MAna? I assume that Nirmama means without 'mama' and Nijala means without jala. Nis'kAncana means without kAncana. Is this correct? Does Nirmanthana mean without Manthana? Does prefix Nir have different meanings in Nirmanthan and in Nirjala? Could we say Nirukta is without Ukta and Nirvacana is without Vacana? What is the etymology of the word Nirvacana?I also read the word Nis'kausAmbih. I would like to believe prefixes or upasargas have fixed meanings. But it seems that certain cases very difficult to crack. That is why this question. Please pardon my ignorance.Thanks. N.R.Joshi
