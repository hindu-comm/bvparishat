Very simple answer was given traditionally applicable for all the prefixes as:

  

*उपसर्गेण धात्वर्थो बलादन्यत्र*नीयते \|. प्रहाराहारसंहारविहारपरिहारवत् \|।

  

the often quoted verse with examples. This holds good in all cases. In some case, it may not differ drastically, as विख्यातिः, प्रख्यातिः, ख्यातिः etc. used as common synonyms. The technical terms coined may vary drastically.

  

गुणो भागः निमानं मूल्यम्। गुणो येन निमीयते मूल्यभूतेन सो ऽपि सामर्थ्याद् भाग एव विज्ञायते। यवानां द्वौ भागौ निमानम्। The different measurements are listed with the prefixed word मान\_

  

"ऊध्र्वमानं किलोन्मानं परिमाणं तु सर्वतः।

आयामस्तु प्रमाणं स्यात्सङ्ख्या बाह्रा तु सर्वतः।'

  

गुरुत्वमानम् उन्मानं पलादि। - measurement of weight

आयाममानं प्रमाणं वितस्त्यादि। - measurement of width or length.

आरोहपरिणाहमानं परिमाणं प्रस्थादि।- measurement of height.

  
These are the technical usages of the word मान with different prefixes as quoted from Kashika commentary.

  

More could be cited, but as stated in the beginning, the meaning depends on the usage of the words in authentic texts (as far as Sanskrit as a written language is concerned).
