For the RV and AV, partly also Kāṭhaka-S, the gloss of Yāska in Nir. I.3 beginning *ā ity arvāgarthe* etc more or less holds good, particularly in principal clauses where they are not compounded and are adverbially used. A strict adherence to the given meanings is not met with in Classical Sanskrit where the adverbial use is no more in vogue.
