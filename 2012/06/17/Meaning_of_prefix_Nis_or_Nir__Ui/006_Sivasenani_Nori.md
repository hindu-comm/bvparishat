Even I wish to know the answer for the same question. Some aspects are available from Sastras, and some could be understood by common sense, but I guess that leaves something to be filled up to arrive at the final or complete picture.

  

First, meanings ought to be known from the Vedanga, Nirukta. One point to note here is that Nirukta treats 'nir' and 'nis' as one unit, and similarly 'dur' and 'dus' as a single upasarga. So, one conjectures that the split of these into two in vyaakaraNa is to accomodate the differing behaviour in sandhis. This is what Nirukta has to say on 'nir'.

  

निर्दुरित्येतयोः प्रातिलोम्यम् ।। निरुक्तम् ।।

  

तद्यथा निर्धनो दुर्बाह्मणः इति ।। ऋज्वर्थः (Durgacharya's commentary) ।।

  

Obviously only the main sense is set out by Nirukta and also the commentator. The nuances are not treated. They are treated in other granthas like the Upasargavritti (the text of which was shared on this list by Dr. Dhaval Patel, sometime ago; available at<http://sanskritworld.in/tag/upasarga-vritti/>)

  

**निर्‌ । वियोगभृशार्थपापात्ययावधारणादेशातिक्रमलाभेषु निरित्युपसर्ग अयमेतेषु अर्थेषु वर्तते ।**

Given below are the examples from Upasargavritti along with the meaning of the sense intended in English, and the examples given in Vacaspatyam. It is interesting that Vacaspatyam lists 6 similar senses on the authority of गणरत्नः. If this refers to the Ganaratnamahodadhi, which is said to be a book of ganas, I wonder why and how 'nir' gets a place there. Presently I do not have access to Ganaratnamahodadhi - and so, I will let that be. Vacaspati gives a seventh sense based on the Medinikosa as 'nishedha' with the example निर्मक्षिकम्.

  

1. वियोगे निःशल्यम्‌ । Here viyoga means 'absence of'. Vacaspatyam gives the example निःसङ्गः. This is also the main sense prescribed by Niruktam.

  

2. भृशार्थे निर्नीतः \[*sic*\] (निर्णीतः) । 'bhrisham' means intensification - where नीतः means 'led', upon intensification by the addition of nir, निर्णीतः means decided.

  

3. पापे निर्मर्यादः । Vacaspatyam does not list this sense. I can't understand how निर्मर्यादः is used in the sense of 'paapa'. This word is used in Ramayana: 'निर्मर्यादस्तु पुरुषः पापाचारसमन्वितः।' (2-109-3; Rama accusing Jabali of being a Chaarvaaka when Jabali suggests that Rama need not got to the forest) and the commentators say that it means 'one devoid of maryaada', i.e. 'nir' has the sense of viyoga. Here are the words of the commentators. Rama (author of Tilaka) - उत्पथवर्ती भिन्नचारित्रदर्शनः ...लोकायतिकादिशास्त्रप्रसक्तः। Ramayanashiromanikaara - त्यक्तवेदमार्गः अत एव भिन्नचारित्रदर्शनः वेदोक्ताचारप्रतियोगिकभेदविशिष्टाचारदर्शकः अत एव पापाचारसमन्वितः पापाचरणविशिष्टः पुरुषः। Govindaraja (BhushaNam) मर्यादरहितः अत एव पापाचारसमन्वितः तत्र हेतुः भिन्नचारित्रदर्शन इति दर्शनं मतं वेदविहितात् भिन्नाचारप्रतिपादकमतप्रवर्तक इत्यर्थः।

  

4. अत्यये निर्दाधं \[*sic*\] (निर्बाधं?) गमनम्‌ । (V:निर्भेधम्). I can't figure out what 'निर्दाधम्' as qualifying 'gamanam' could mean, or how atyaya (it obviously cannot mean the rudhi artha of 'death' or 'passing away' here; it is more like 'over-reach' or 'extending beyond' अति + इ). Even so, निर्बाधम् would have 'nir' meaning viyoga (without obstructions). To me the difference between 'bheda' and 'nirbheda' only seems to be that of intensity.

  

5. अवधारणे निश्चितः । (Determination) (V gives this meaning as 'निश्चिते', निश्चितम्)

  

6. आदेशे निर्दिष्टः । (V:निर्देशः) Addition of 'nir' makes the verb an instruction.

  

7. अतिक्रमे निःक्रांतः \[*sic*\] । (V: निष्क्रान्तः). Except the vi-sandhi in Upasargavirtti, there is no difference.

  

8. लाभे निर्विशेषः ॥ ७ ॥ (V has 'भोगे', निर्वेशः). If 'विश्' is to enter, settle, or to flow 'निर्वेशः', a kind of payment, is to do so for the sake of enjoyment. This example makes some sense. But, how can निर्विशेषः, devoid of any 'viSesha', be an example for the use of 'nir' in the sense of gain?

  

What this shows is that the way Jain scholars used some of the Sanskrit words (the word 'karma' comes readily to mind), is substantially different from the way a sanaatanadharmin uses the words.

  

Coming back to 'nir', it seems that in addition to the sense of 'praatilomyam' described by the Niruktam, a sense of intensification definitely obtains. The other senses (for instructing, for enjoyment etc.) listed by Vacaspati are really variations of intensification.

  

How could something meaning 'opposite' end up as an intensifier? One could speculate as follows using the example of nirvacanam. Nirvacanam would initially be, like say nirupamaanam, that for which there are no further words. Now, if we build upon this and say, 'that meaning beyond which there are no further words', then we arrive at the sense in which the word is used: definition.
