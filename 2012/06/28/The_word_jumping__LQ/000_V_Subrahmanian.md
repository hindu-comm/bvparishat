Recently I wanted a sanskrit word for 'jump' and looked up the V.S.Apte's English-Sanskrit Dictionary. I was surprised to find there for the word 'jumping',among others like 'plavanam', utpatanam, etc. there is a word 'jhampaH / A'.  
  
It is also known to most of us that the English 'genital organ' is 'jananendriyam' in Sanskrit. The close similarity in the sound: ja is noteworthy.
