To: [v.subra...@gmail.com]()  
  
  
The word Jhampaa in Sanskrit may be rendered as Jump in English. A  
renowned scholar, Sri Vedam Venkataraya Sastri, in his monumental  
commentary on the Amuktamalyada (a Telugu Mahakavya) of the celebrated  
Vijayanagar Emperor Sri Krishna Devaraya, made this observation while  
commenting on the expression Chatula -Jhampaa- taras -svanagaree  
vipareeta-paatita-aashaakona-paribridhamulu which is a description of  
Garuda.
