I don't think I said anything like this.  
As shruti says "सत्यं ज्ञानमनन्तं ब्रह्म" , shA\~Nkara-s say that this specific GYAnam which is चित् is निर्विषय and अविकारि . So, svAtmarUpaGYAnam is not "knowledge of" any state and is not specific to any state(you said "in the natural state".)  
So, in simple words brahman of vedAntin-s is known as svAtmarUpa-GYAnam and parabhrahmAtmaka-GYAna.

This is also not what I said.  
charama-vR^itti-rUpa-GYAna is a specific mano-vR^itti which is generated by mahAvAkya-s and it reveals brahman(i.e. brahmAtmaka-GYAnam). This is not same as you said above. According to your words charama-vR^itti-rUpa-GYAnam = brahman (brahmAtmaka-GYAna) when revealed by mahAvAkya-s. While I said that charama-vR^itti-rUpa-GYAnam reveals brahman (brahmAtmaka-GYAna) and is not same as that.
