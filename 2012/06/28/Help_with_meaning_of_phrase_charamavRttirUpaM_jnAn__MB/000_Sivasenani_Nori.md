Mesdames and Sirs



I have a doubt as to what is meant by the phrase चरमवृत्तिरूपं ज्ञानम्, as used byBhaskararaayain the commentary on the 402nd naama of Laliltaasahasranaamaavalee.



विद्याविद्यास्वरूपिणी ।। 402 ।।

“ विद्यां चाविद्यां च यस्तद्वेदोभयं सः। अविद्यया मृत्युं तीर्त्वा विद्ययामृतमश्नुत।। ” इति प्रसिद्धे विद्याविद्ये। विद्या स्वात्मरूपं ज्ञानम्। अविद्या चरमवृत्तिरूपं ज्ञानं तदुभयं स्वरूपमस्याः। उक्तं च बृहन्नारदीये “ तस्य शक्तिः परा विष्णोः जगत्कार्यपरिक्षमा भावाभावस्वरूपा सा विद्याविद्येति गीयत ” इति। देवीभागवतेऽपि “ ब्रह्मैव सातिदुष्प्रापा विद्याविद्यास्वरूपिणी ” ति। तत्रैव स्थलान्तरे “ विद्याविद्येति देव्या द्वे रूपे जानीहि पार्थिव एकया मुच्यते जन्तुः अन्यया बध्यते पुन ” रिति। यद्वा विद्यैव चरमवृत्तिरूपं ज्ञानम्। अविद्या भेदभ्रान्तिरूपं ज्ञानम्। स्वः परब्रह्मात्मकं ज्ञानम्। ‘स्वः’पदस्य आत्मवाचित्वात्। “ स्वोऽज्ञातावानी ” ति कोशात्। एतत्त्रयं रूपमस्याः। उक्तं च लैङ्गे “ भ्रान्तिर्विद्यापरं चेति शिवरूपमिदं त्रयम्। अर्थेषु भिन्नरूपेषु विज्ञानं भ्रान्तिरुच्यते। आत्माकारेण संवित्तिः बुधैर्विद्येति कथ्यते। विकल्परहितं तत्त्वं परमभिधीयत ” इति।



In the above, in the first instance, one would expectचरमवृत्तिरूपं ज्ञानम् to beopposed to, or distinct from, स्वात्मरूपं ज्ञानम्। In the second usage, we see that it is also distinct from भेदभ्रान्तिज्ञानम् and परब्रह्मात्मकं ज्ञानम्. Ifचरम were used in the sense of last in chronological order, what kind of last conduct would चरमवृत्तिरूपं ज्ञानम् be? If, by चरम we mean the time of death, how does it fit the context? If, by चरम, ultimate is meant, what ultimate knowledge is there beyond स्वस्वरूपज्ञानम् andब्रह्मज्ञानम् ? Or, going by Vaacaspatyam, चरम ... शेषभवे, it captures the sense not captured by the other expressions. If so, the first usage is understandable: it is everything other than Self-knowledge; this view is the classic advaitic one; but in the second interpretation, it has to mean something other than a) Brahman-knowledge and b) the false knowledge of difference. Here, whatcould difference refer to? It cannot be the difference between Brahman and Atman because apart from true knowledge of Brahman ((a) above) and false knowledge (of difference, (b) above), there is no remainder-knowledge. Then, the difference must beamongst jivas. In such a situation, three kinds of knowledge are possible - (a) Brahman-knowledge, (b) the false knowledge of difference \[amongst jivas\] and (c) remainder-knowledge that says there is no difference amongst jivas,always provided(c) is not equivalent to (a). Such a viewmight bemore like the bhedaabheda view. Or, am I reading too much into the whole thing? Is there a simpler, more straight forward explanation? Or, is this is a technical term in the system of Bhaskara?



I ask this question not because the meaning of the naama is not clear: that is clear enough. It repeats what is stated in the ISopanishad, and is echoed in the definition of Bhagavaan in Vishnu Purana and Devi Bhagavatam (

'उत्पत्तिं च विनाशं च भूतानामागतिं गतिम्। वेत्ति विद्यामविद्यां च स वाच्यो भगवानिति।।'). According to the commentary of Sankara on Isopanishad, " अविद्यया = कर्मणा अग्निहोत्रादिना ",avidya refers to karmakaaNDa and vidya refers to देवताज्ञानम्. If we want to remove the advaitic idealogical underpinnings, then avidya would be something which gives worldly pleasures (yaj\~nas give such results, as seen from injunctions such as पशुकामो यजेत)and vidya is ultimate knowledge. So Bhagavaan, or Sreemaata, have bothworldly and ultimate knowledge as their form.



The doubt is with regard to where Bhaskara Raya stands. Ihave not (yet)studied the Saubhaagyabhaaskaram as I come from a family which thinks Bhaskara's interpretation is not correct (One is supposed to read texts of one's sampradaaya first and others later). Meanwhile, due to some other discussion, I had to look up the commentary on this naama, and having read, I was wonderingwhat was meantby the commentator.
