Thanks to Dr. E. R. Narayanan mahodaya and Sri V. Subrahmanian mahodaya and the Yativara Sri Lalitalaalitahfor giving examples of usage of charamavrittiroopaj\~naanam in other instances and for expanding the meaning. Largely there is agreement amongst the three scholars as to what charamavrittiroopam j\~naanam is, though there are differences in the nuances. The fine difference between svaatmaroopamj\~naanam and bramhj\~naanam pointed out by Sri Lalitalaalitah and Sri Subrahmanian is the key.



Then, in the first instance of the usage of the phrase, svaatmaroopam j\~naanam is the knowledge of, and in, the natural state which does not require any external aid and charamavrittiroopam j\~naanamis the same brahman-knowledge acquired through Saastras. In the second instance of the usage, we substitute parabramhaatmakamj\~naanam for svaatmaroopam j\~naanam, and add an additional component: bhedabhrantih- or theapparent worldlybusiness. Why introduce such a fine difference between vidya and avidya or svahand vidya? The answer might be that one shouldtry to always describe the Motherin the most laudable terms possible. So, if it is stated that avidya is her rupam, thenwe look for the most lofty definition of avidya.



Once again, thanks for taking out the time required to respond.

In Advaita there is the mUlAavidyAnivartaka jnAnam that is required for one to become an aparoksha jnAni and thereby a mukta/jivan mukta. This jnanam is technically called 'akhanDAkAravRttiH' or 'brahmAkAravRtiiH' or 'brahmavidyA' or 'charma vRttiH'. ... This is the last vRttiH for that jiva in the avidyA avasthA. Thereafter this jivan mukta is in moksha avasthA, according to Advaita. The mind will continue and other vRttis will come as per prArabdha. But owing to the charama vRtti he understands that all this mind, vRtti, etc. is only mithyA, bAdhitasya anuvRttiH.
