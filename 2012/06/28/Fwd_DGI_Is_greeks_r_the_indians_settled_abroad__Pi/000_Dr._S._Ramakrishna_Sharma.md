The Greeks and the Indians: Scholars have been divided about the origin of Greeks, but not of Indians. Indian sources assert that Yavanas were degraded Kshatriyas. Bury's notings11 are given for convenience about the Greek origins:  
  
1. The Greek sources themselves accept that Iavana = Iavones (= Yavana) is the oriental name for Greeks.  
2. The name "Greece" is derived from Graia -> Graii (L) -> Graeci -> Greece and applies to the colonists implying that they came from outside replacing Pelasgians. Though, even Bury records it, he does not mention to which oriental language that orient name belonged.  
3. The original coming of the Greeks was utterly forgotten by their descendants, and we are unable to fix the date.  
4. The old home of the invaders is supposed to have lain in the north-west regions of the Balkan peninsula.  
5. The Greeks of history who had completely forgotten this far-distant past were not exclusively the descendants of these Greek invaders.  
  
Edward Pococke12 shows how Indians colonized Greece. Col.Tod13 delves on the similarities between Indians and Greeks. C. F. C. Volney14 in his search of lost tribes finds that both belong to the same stock. H. P. Blavatsky15 has been specific about the Indian origin of Greek civilization. Chamanlal16 and other scholars also point out the fact with linguistic, anthropological and archaeological evidences.  
  
Only later, they reverse stand is popularized and propagated in textbooks. In any case, as the antiquity of Indians has been well before the advent of the Greeks, only the Indian influence is plausible, probable and possible and not the other way.  
  
However, Weber proposed, assuming on the Alexander invasion, that his expedition into India brought about some kind of knowledge of the substance of the Homeric story found its way into India. This clearly proves that the argument was put forward to strengthen the theory of "Alexander invasion of India" and thus show that everything came to India through Greeks thereafter. This syndrome working in them could be noted in the writings of John Bentley, William Jones, Vincent Smith, Heras and others.  
  
The occurrence of a list of names of Kamboja, Yavana, saka, Barbara, Mlechchha, Tushara, Harita, Kirata and others in Ramayana was taken as the proof of Greek influence. That Indians and their literature considered Yavanas as their degraded Khastriyas and thus excommunicated people group is not at all denied. Therefore, Indians never considered them alien, in fact, the learned ones were treated with respect (Yavanacharya) . Even Sangam Tamil Literature uses "Yavanas" in geographical context without specifically pointing to any people group. Moreover, from the western sources, it is noted that the word "yavana" was never used to denote only "the Greeks".  
  
1. Max Mueller17 himself showed that "yavana" is not the exclusive name of the Greeks or Ionians.  
2. Goldstucker18 pointed out that "yavanani' as alluded by Panini was in fact referred to the Persian cuneiform alphabet.  
3. Of course, Panini19 himself points out the three different meanings prevalent to the word "yavanani".  
  
Even in the dramaturgy, chronologically, the Indian drama is traced back to Vedic period (literary evidence – c.4500-3500 BCE), well before the advent of the Greeks in Greece itself (c.,1000 BCE) 20. The archaeological evidences from Indus / Harappan valley, again proves the antiquity of dance and drama to 2500-1950 BCE period21. The philosophy behind the first drama of Persoe Aechylus is traced back to Indian origin based on Zeus and Promethecus discussion22. Therefore, the Greek influence on Valmiki is ruled out and in fact, the Ramayana's influence on other literature has to be studied critically.  
  
Many figures in the Sumerian, Akkadian, Babylonian, Kassite, Hittite, Assyrian, Achaemenian, Seleuid or Parthian, Sassanian and other seals make any researcher think about India only, as in no other country such figures are used even today as being used in India23.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Particularly, the two or three figures with bow and arrows standing together remind Rama and Lakshmana or with Sita together as depicted in India24. In fact, the occurrences of Indian seals (IVC) in the Middle East and the commercial contact between these civilizations prove25 only the Indian influence.  
  
Some of the seals are shown as illustration. How this type of Indian features should figure should be subjected to a separate study.  
  
The Mittani who worshipped Vedic gods, belonged to an Indic kingdom that was connected by marriage across several generations to the Egyptian 18th dynastry to which Akhneten (1352-1336 BCE) belonged. The first Mittani King was Sutarna I (good sun). The names of the successors are Indian as listed below:  
  
Name of the King  
Meaning  
In a treaty39 between Mittanians and Hittites dated to 15th – 14th cent.BCE (the Boghkoi inscriptions) , the gods Mitrasil, Arunasil, Indar and Nasattyana side by side with Teshup and Hepa have been mentioned. They are nothing but Indian gods – Mithra, Varuna, Indra and the Nasatyas. Teshup and Hepa are local gods. Their kings too had names like Mattiwaza, Tushratta, Mariannu and so on and they are typically Indian. Not only kings have Sanskrit names, their records have many such words denoting day to day to things, goods etc. Few examples are –  
  
1. A text by a Mitannian named Kikkuli uses words such as aika (eka, one), tera (tri, three), panza (pancha, five), satta (sapta, seven), na (nava, nine), vartana (vartana, round).  
2. Another text has babru (babhru, brown), parita (palita, grey) and pinkara (pingala, red).  
3. Their chief festival was the celebration of vishuva (solstice) very much like India.  
Sutarna I  
Good sun  
Paratarna I  
Great sun  
Parashukshatra  
Ruler with axe  
Saukshatru  
Son of Sukshatra, the good ruler  
Paratarna II,  
Artatama or Ritadhama  
Abiding in cosmic law  
Sutarna II  
  
Dasharatha  
  
Mtivaja or Matiwazza  
Whose wealth is prayer  
  
Here also Dasharatha is found, why not, historians ignore this reference and deny Ramayana'a influence there? Have scholars been selective in choosing and quoting the inscriptions? In fact, it is evident that Ramayana had been so popular that it was known among the Hittites during c.14th cent.BCE itself. Therefore, the influence on the Greeks is very imminent and factual.
