Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



I write papers in English using Ariel Unicode MS. It helps me to insert diacritical marks for SAnskrit words written in Roman scripts. Sometimes would I like to insert Devanagari letters. But I do not find in the list Devnagari letter for 'ks\_' the last letter and for 'jn' as in Jnyaana (knowledge).



Few years ago I use to mail font file to the editor and ask him to install my fonts. Then he can see all diacritical marks as well as Devnagari letters correctly. But it is becoming cumbersome. Many have Ariel Unicode MS fonts on their computers. It is easy to use them. But I cannot find those two Devanagari letters in the list. Please help.Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
