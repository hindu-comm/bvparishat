नमस्ते!

RV suktas are titled with Rishi, Devata and Chhandas (R,D,C) as is wellknown. Not all the publications of RVgive the fourth caption: 'viniyoga'. The RDC system is attributed to Kaatyaayana's SarvaanukramaNi. The viniyoga perhaps comes from another source. ButKS contains more than R,D,C.The textis too crisp and formulaic. For example:

यस्य वाक्यं सऋषिः। यातेनोच्यतेसा देवता। (२।४-५) hence Lopaamudraa becomes the seer for the 1.179.1-2, as it is said पूर्वीः षड् जायापत्योः लोपामुद्राया अगस्त्यस्य च .... The hymn 179 starts with
पूर्वीः. It has six verses. The seer for the first two is Lopaamudaraa and next two are by Agastya. Theऋषिः for theremaining four is अगस्त्यशिष्यो ब्रह्मचारी॥

In some cases the identification is straightforward. For RV 10.159.the textsays

उदसौ षट् पौलोमीशच्यात्मानं तुष्टावानुष्टुभं॥ Here the R, D, C is very clear.

The usageऋषिका is perhaps traditional outside the texts. In Shaunaka's anuvaaka-anukramaNi, in the 12th part the list of female seers is given and are specifically called

ब्रह्मवादिन्यः (see attachment)

Errors of omission & commission in my post may please be pointed out by scholars.
