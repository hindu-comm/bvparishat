Thanks for the learned reply to the question.

I don't think the above statement is correct as the same शौनक in his बृहद्देवता attests in the case of लोपामुद्रा and अगस्त्य -

  

ऋतौ स्नातामृषिर्भार्यां लोपामुद्रां यशस्विनीम्।

उपजल्पितुमारेभे रहःसंयोगकाम्यया॥५७॥

द्वाभ्यां सा त्वब्रवीद् ऋग्भ्यां पूर्वीरिति चिकीर्षितम्।

रिरंसुस्तामथागस्त्य उत्तराभ्यामतोषयत्॥५८॥

विदित्वा तपसा सर्वं तयोर्भावं रिरंसतोः।

श्रुत्वैनः कृतवानस्मि ब्रह्मचार्युत्तमे जगौ॥५९॥

  

I have not translated literally the above, but it is clear from the above that they lived as husband and wife (भार्या) and the celibate disciple ब्रह्मचारी overheard their conversation and feels offended on overhearing it. I don't know the end result as we have only the conversation part and the Sukta being devoted to अश्विनी-s in the next part युवो रजांसि. This is the context of the I.179. 

  

The No.4 Rik ends up the conversation with the words of अगस्त्य -

  

लोपामुद्रा वृषणं नी रिणाति धीरमधीरा धयति श्वसन्तम्।

  

which indicates that Agastya allowed the prayer of लोपामुद्रा which shows they lived a normal life as husband and wife as बृहद्देवता attests.

  

The same is about मैत्रेयी and कात्यायनी the wives of याज्ञवल्क्य. Only मैत्रेयी was a ब्रह्मवादिनी, who participated in the discussions about ब्रह्म with her husband while कात्यायनी was content with house hold life. This is the content of शतपथब्राह्मण. We here one गार्गी also who engaged in debate with the great याज्ञवल्क्य the end result being she was given salvation from this life without any answer having realized the Self. These could really be called ब्रह्मवादिनी-s who debate and share the ideology of Self आत्मन् with their husbands.

  

I just wanted to know the usage of the word ऋषिका in the Vedic Literature.
