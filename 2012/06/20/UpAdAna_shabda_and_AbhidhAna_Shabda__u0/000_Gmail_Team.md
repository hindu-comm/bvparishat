Respected Scholars Namaskar!



I see Prof Korada listed verse from First Canto of Vakyapadiya where the word "UpAdAna" appears. Now different authors translate that word differently. According one author UpAdAna shabda means 'speech unit'.
Is it possible to say that what we hear when some one speaks one word, is UpAdAna shabda (speech unit) but its meaning is associated with sphota. Is there difference between UpAdAna shabda and AbhidhAna shabda? Thanks. N.R.Joshi
