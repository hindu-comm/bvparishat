Dear Prof. Korada, Thank you very much for giving example of Nir, and Nis.



My understanding of the word "Nirmanthana" is that it shows immediate result of 'manthana' such as Nirmanthana with AraNi produces Agni. Charudeva Shastry in his book . Vyaakrana Candrodaya describes meaning of Nirdis'Ta as immediate after Dis'Ta. The meaning of Nirgama is immediately after one leaves the place. If we do not understand this way then what is the difference between Manthan and Nirmanthan? Nis'kausAbhih means left the city Kausambhi just now. I am trying understand the intricate meanings of Nir, and Nis. Is it possible to explain Nirvacana and Nirukta using prefix 'Nir" and its meaning? Thanks, N,R,Joshi
