Respected Professor Joshi,  
Although I am not competent enough to speak about such a complex topic, but still I would like to share a few viewpoints. I apologise in anticipation that the idea may not be that matured due to my ignorance so that the scholars are hereby requested to correct me.   
The term "nitya" is stands to indicate for all the three times, past, present and future; i.e kālatrayavyāpin which corresponds the term eternal. The Grammarians consider the śabda as nitya. The term "eternal" could more be appropriate to indicate "nitya" rather than the term "conventional", as the term "conventional" could more appropriate for "lakṣaṇā" where the most popular or the etymological meaning has been overlooked or empowered by another meaning emerged contextually or through certain circumstances. For instance, "paṅkaja" has an etymological meaning of "paṅkajanikartṛ" "something born from marsh" but still due to conventional and popular usage, the meaning of the term is stipulated to "lotus" only. In that way all conventional meanings may not go on changing. Because when we use "paṅkaja" during the Puranic era or nowadays the meaning intended is "lotus" only. The divisions of different status of the sound is for convenience, as just like time. Time, direction etc. are although one each they are used as many like past and present; or south and west etc. for convenience. Parāvāk is the fundamental form, and other divisions (paśyantī, madhyamā and vaikharī) of different process of sound production are for convenience. Varṇa and svara are the methods to use the nitya śabda. It should not be used meaningless in terms of its varṇa and svara. Grammarians believe that it will yield an opposite result to the intention of the user.   
Regarding the term "devavāṇī" the term "deva" indicates three actions like dāna (to provide, donate), dīpana (to enlighten) and dyotana (to make others shine). So, devavāṇī is used in cases of dāna, dīpana and dyotana. The donation and enlightenment could have provided the divinity.  
Regards,  
Narayanan
