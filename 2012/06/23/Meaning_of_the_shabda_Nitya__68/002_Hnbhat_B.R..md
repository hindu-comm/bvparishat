Regarding the term "devavāṇī" the term "deva" indicates three actions  
like dāna (to provide, donate), dīpana (to enlighten) and dyotana (to  
make others shine). So, devavāṇī is used in cases of dāna, dīpana and  
dyotana. The donation and enlightenment could have provided the  
divinity.

  
दिवु = क्रीडा-विजिगीषा-व्यवहार-द्युति-स्तुति-मोद-मद-स्वप्न-कान्ति-गतिषु ।

I don't think देववाणी is dependent on donations, grants, gifts from  
Govt. and Private bodies and made use by the common people to earn  
their living in the ancient time.

एकः शब्दः सुष्ठु प्रयुक्तः स्वर्गे लोके कामधुग् भवति need not apply to  
other languages, as स्वर्ग is the invention of देववाणी, spoken by  
देव-s, the inhabitants of स्वर्ग. Otherwise, it is useful to use  
proper language appropriate for the context to achieve the desired  
reaction using any language will not make much difference in the  
appropriate use of the language in this world.

Just a reflection.
