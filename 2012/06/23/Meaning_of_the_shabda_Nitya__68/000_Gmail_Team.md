Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



Meaning of the shabda 'Nitya"



I think there is some confusion here in my mind. Sanskrit scholars think that the meaning of shabdas are Nitya. Do they mean Nityathe same asconventional?

This way I understand. The English word 'Serendipity' is the conventional word. It came from the name "Sinhala Dweepa" (Ceylon). In short English superimposed new meaning on the word derived from the name of the island. If meaning-shabda relation in Sanskrit is eternal (Nitya), they how could be conventional at the same time? Conventional meanings go on changing. If meanings of Sanskrit words are conventional like any other language, then Sanskrit could not be a divine language (Deva-vaNee). It is on the footing the same as other languages. If whatever comes down from Shabda-Brahma into VaikharI the same in all languages, then Sanskrit is not special. On the other hand if something has to come down from Shabda -Brahma, then it has to happen in the way of nature. And in case of Vaikhari the only natural thing is acoustic properties of Sanskrit varNas. If VarNas have constant (Nitya) meanings, then shabdas havealso constant(Nitya) meanings. People may change it. That is different story. Please enlighten us.

In my opinion, in UpAdAna shabda, the meaning is superimposed. So shabda is used (UpAdAna) to indicate something. English creates UpAdAna shabdas everyday for new technological terms. On the other hand in the Nitya shabda, meaning is not superimposed.It rises internally and naturally. UpAdAna shabdas from all languages are VarNAtmaka with few exceptions. I know that.. I am not talking here about DhvanyAtmaka shabda ( water dripping from tap).Please enlighten us. Thanks. N.R.Joshi
