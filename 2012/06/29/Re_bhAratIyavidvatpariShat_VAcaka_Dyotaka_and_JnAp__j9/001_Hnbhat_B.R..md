Dear Joshi,

  

It seems that Prof. Korada's message was sent to you only.

  

Can you please forward the message you received to the group, so that all the members would benefit from it?

  

Thanks in advance.

  

I remember, the difference of opinion in regard to निपत and उपसर्ग whether these are वाचक-s or द्योतक-s is dealt with detail in वैयाकरणभूषण and वैयाकरणभूषणसार which is to be traced to वाक्यपदीय originally, but for the dialectic presentation in the said text by कौण्डभट्ट. For other words, the theories of Meaning, अभिधा, भावना, लक्षणा, व्यञ्जना are the same dealt with in the texts Literary Criticism and in the restricted environments of related शास्त्र-s न्याय and मीमांसा which deal with semantics in detail. All the views are presented in the encyclopeadic work Sri NS Ramanuja Tatacharya, in his own style, in शाब्दबोधमीमांसा written in Sanskrit.
