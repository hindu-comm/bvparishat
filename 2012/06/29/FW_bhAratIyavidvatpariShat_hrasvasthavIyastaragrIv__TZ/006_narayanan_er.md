Respected Sir,

I am happy to read your valuable explanation. Confusion then happens when some poets, having very high grammatical backgrounds, use such rare and complicated applications on the basis of the Puranic and the Mahabharata usages. It is nice to read your explanation that how the Kashika viewpoint has been conquered by Patanjali's right stand. Professor Arthur Avalon's edition of the Prapancasara by MLBD, Delhi is attributed to one Sankaracarya, which gives quite a few usages of "hunet". Narayanabhatta also claiming in his Apaniniyapramanyasadhana that "hunet" is used by Sankaracarya. Within my very little sense, I should say, I am also not agreeable with the usage of "hunet" as correct. Regarding the counter argument on the Kashika, Haradatta had naturally have to shift on to the conclusion that Patanjali has to be right, to stand on the mainstream of an authentic grammar; whereas the authors of Kashika finding combinations of affixes with a view to justifying Puranic or Mahabharatic usages even with a supporting context of Brahmanical usages.  

Thank you very much, Sir, for your valuable enlightenment.

Regards,

Narayanan
