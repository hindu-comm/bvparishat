आयुष्मान् भव  
  
the book gives different 'things ' we consume , say pepper , dhaniyaa , etc. , vegetables , milk , curd etc., tamarind (tree and raw/fruit ) etc. some medicinal plants like tulasi , things taken raw / dry / mixed and so on and so forth .  
  
There will be some info which you require , especially from medicinal point of view .  
I recommend the book .  
  
you may try thru Internet also for the book or write a letter.
