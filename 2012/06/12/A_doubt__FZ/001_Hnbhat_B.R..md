Danu, the daughter of Daksha, married to Kashypa Prajapati, is popular as the mother of दानव-s.

  

And there is one Danu, the name of a King, sons of Rambha and Karambha according Puranic Encyclopedia of Vettam Mani. It is difficult to account for why this name has appeared in the list if it be one of the two persons we know by the name.

  

It is to be noted that Prahlada the Great Vaishnava, the grand father of Bali is not included in the list. It may suggest Prahlada also, but there is obvious reason for it.
