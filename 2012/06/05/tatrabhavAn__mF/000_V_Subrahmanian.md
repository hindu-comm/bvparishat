Namaste.  
  
I am always intrigued by the (addressing) usage 'तत्रभवान्’, तत्रभवन्तः’ etc. Is there any grammatical explanation to this usage? There are two words 'tatra' (there) and 'bhavAn' (you). How and why are they connected? Is it some way of saying, calling out: 'Oh, you, there '? Is it not a little crude, uncivil, to employ this kind of usage while addressing dignified people?  
  
Kindly share your thoughts on this.  
  
Warm regards,
