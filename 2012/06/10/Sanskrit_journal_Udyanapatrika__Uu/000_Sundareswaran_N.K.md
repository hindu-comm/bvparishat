Dear Scholars,

Could anybody please help me in getting some articles written by late P S Subbaramabhattar published in the Journal UDYANAPATRIKA from Kumbhagonam , Tamilnadu in the 1930's? Please find the list attached.

I am told that Sarasvati Mahal Library, Thanjavur has some back volumes of UDYANAPATRIKA.

  

  

Thanking you in advance,

N.K. Sundareswaran,
