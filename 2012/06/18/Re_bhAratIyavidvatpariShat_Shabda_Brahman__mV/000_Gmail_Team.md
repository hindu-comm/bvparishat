Dear Dr.Ajit Gargeshvari,



I waited to see if anybody offer explanation for refutation of SPhota Doctrine.

Now I have question and reply.



Reply first; Proponents of Sphota say meaning is in sphota. Now we hear speech, we do not hear sphota. We understanding meaning. So where did meaning come from? They say from sphota. They postulate sphota from meaning and now they say meaning come from sphota, Here is the fault of interdependence (Anyonya Aashrya).



Question now for all scholars; It is said sphota was first discussed by Sphotayan, But not enough information is available about this Aachaarya.



My question-How did he get idea of Sphota in the first place and when?
How many years before PANini (500 Bc). I think PaNini mentions the name Sphotayana. What happened soSphotayana stumbled on Sphota? Was any discusion on Sphota before PANini or Sphotayana?

Other scholars can add and correct me if I were wrong so that I with others grow in knoweledge.Thanks.N.R.Joshi.

Respected Scholars,  
Can you please explain to me the difference between Shabda Brahman as  
per Vakyapadeeya and The concept of Brahman as per Shankara Advaita  
and What is the Background for refutation the Sphota Doctrine??  
  
Regards  
Ajit Gargeshwari
