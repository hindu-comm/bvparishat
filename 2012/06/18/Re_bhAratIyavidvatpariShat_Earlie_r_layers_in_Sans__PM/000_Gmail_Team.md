Respected Scholars,Namaskar!



Thank you professor Korada for detailed explanation on mantra, ooha, and on position of Vaiyakaranas and MImAmsakas with respect to varNa, pada and vAkya. At the end you said these topics better be discussed face to face. I wish I could be there in Hyderabad. Since I am in USA, bvparishat is the avenue for me to learn nuances of Sanskrit grammar from scholars like you, Dr. H.N.Bhat and Dr. D. Bhattacharya and others. Sometimes I hesitate to ask question. I read about PraNava as creation point long ago but never thought asking question about it. I am glad now asked the question. One gentleman (Madhavachar-I think)posted a jpg page in his posting. There he mentioned view of Sri Madhvacarya-“at the time of creation Bhagavan Narayan first uttered ‘Om’ ‘Atha’. This is what I was saying referring to the book of Meher Baba (holy saint of India). Shadow of nothingness (MAYA) is centrifuged out (meaning of varNa /th/). In my phonemic symbolism the meaning of the phoneme /th/ is to centrifuge out. This fits so will to the idea of Jagan MithyA (centrifuged out). It may explain the word ‘Vivarta’. There are not many words in Apte dictionary that start with varNa /th/. The same idea is present in the word ‘Manthana’. My efforts are to use ground level physics of sound concepts to explain meaning of Sanskrit shabdas without theological superstructure. Meaning of /sh/ explains all characteristics of Shiva. Meaning of /v/ explains all characteristics of Vis’Nu and so on. The purpose of asking questions here to learn meanings of special Sanskrit words from scholars listed above and then check my understanding about them. So participating in bvparishat helps me in advancing my knowledge. Here is my inderstanding of shabda based on physics of sound. It is a sound pulse as opposed to naada which is continous ringing sound (tuning fork vibrating). Dhvani is simply sound. Spoken varNa,shabda,pada and vAkya (with one word only) are shabdas (pulses). A vAkya with two or more words contain two or more pulses. VarNAtmaks shabda may have meaning. Thanks.N.R.Joshi.
