Sir



I looks like Br. Sri Prof. Korada Subrahmanyam garu's email was sent only to you. It would be most useful if the same can be forwarded to BVP. (The problem is that a few weeks back, the setting of BVP has been changed by the administrator. Earlier, clicking on the reply button used to send the email to the list; now, it has been changed in such a way that by clicking on the reply button, the reply is sent only to the original poster, to whose post a reply is being given. Now, one has to type the email ID of BVP, i.e. [bvpar...@googlegroups.com]() in the 'To' field, if one's reply has to be sent to the list).



Regards

N. Siva Senani
