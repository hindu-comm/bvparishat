Dear Sh. Ganesh  
  
How does an Internet hoax, most probably not coming from a Sanskrit speaker, become an act of inferiority complex strongly rooted in our people, especially Sanskritists? On the contrary, in my experience many Sanskrit speakers have a superiority complex, justified to an extent, of speaking the language of the Gods.  
  
There are many such urban legends/conspiracy theories/hoaxes circulated everyday on emails and Facebook/YouTube including some ludicrous ones like some month being the first one in hundreds of years with five Thursdays, Indira Gandhi being a secret Muslim by the name of Maimoona Begum, 9/11 being planned by the Pentagon, and I have a good laugh at them but don't read much into it in terms of superiority or inferiority complex.  
  
Thanks, Nityanand
