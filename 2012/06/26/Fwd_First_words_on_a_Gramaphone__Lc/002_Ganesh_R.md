Dear Sirs,  
  
Me to have heard this story on several occasions but not once any one gave me the exact proofs for this. I would naturally be happy if this is true. If not, taking this also as a cheep deplorable act of inferiority complex strongly rooted in our people, especially among the Sanskritists, feel too embarrassed in my own heart.  
This mail at any case is not hurt any body. This only to know the fact and respect the tradition of truth, the very breath of our Vedic seers.  
  
regards  
  
ganesh
