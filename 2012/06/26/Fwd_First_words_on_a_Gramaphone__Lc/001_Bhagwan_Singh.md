Looking at our past glories we must reassure ourselves, we have done it, we can do it again. Looking at he present discomfiture we must think, why we have become what we are? Most of the scholars of Sanskrit, simply quote and recite, as if all the solutions are available and conforming to them ans singing our praise is going to lead ahead. No hope that they can mend their ways. What else Max Mular said about our present state is forgotten. We should get rid of self adulation and weigh with a physical balance what is our value.
