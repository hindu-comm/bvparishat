Prof Kaorada,  
  
Thank you for having spent some time in trying to provide an outline to my questions. I understand the subject is vast. I wanted are there any books on which detailed comparative studies have made between the concept of Spohta using Vakyapadiya, Spotasiddhi and Sphotanirnaya verse Advaitic and Mimamsa texts such as sloka vartika etc.  
Regards
