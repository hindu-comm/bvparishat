Dear Sri Anand



Since there is the simhasa\~Nkraanti on Aug. 16, how can an adhikamaasa begin on Aug 3 for North Indians? I mean adhikamaasa by definition is one without sa\~NkramaNam, but there is a sa\~Nkraanti within the month. Or, is it that they define an adhikamaasa differently? May be some North Indian scholars can help with the question.



Regards

N. Siva Senani
