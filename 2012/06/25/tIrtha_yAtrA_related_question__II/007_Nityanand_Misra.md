Namo rāghavāya  
  
For your information, as per the Pūrṇimānta Pañcāṅga system followed in North India, here are the dates of the Śuddha and Adhika Bhādrapada.  
  
Bhādrapada Kṛṣṇa Pakṣa (Śuddha) - August 3 to August 17, 2012  
Bhādrapada Śukla Pakṣa (Adhika) - August 18 to August 31, 2012  
Bhādrapada Kṛṣṇa Pakṣa (Adhika) - September 1 to September 16, 2012  
Bhādrapada Śukla Pakṣa (Śuddha) - September 17 to September 30, 2012  
  
The Adhika month is between the two parts of Śuddha month and begins on August 18 and not August 3. You can see more details in the Pañcāṅga on the website of Shri Tulsi Peeth Seva Nyas:

Can also be had from the downloads page  
  
<http://jagadgururambhadracharya.org/downloads> (under Miscellaneous Works).  
  
I do not know much in this regard so cannot answer any further questions. The Pañcāṅga has been prepared by my Gurubhrātā, Śrī Rāmādhāra Śarmā of Patna, who is an engineer and mathematician as well. If you have any other questions, you can message me personally and I can share with you the contact of Śrī Rāmādhāra Śarmā.  
  
Thanks, Nityanand
