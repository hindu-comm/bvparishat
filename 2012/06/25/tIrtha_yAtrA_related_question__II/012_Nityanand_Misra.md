Dear Sri Anand  
  
Namo Rāghavāya. To the best of my information, the reckoning of the Adhika month between two halves of the Śuddha month is followed in all Northern regions of India which have the Pūrṇimānta Pañcāṅga system including Vārāṇasī. As a mailing list member messaged to me, the same dates are given in the Gita Press calender for the Adhika month which is published from Gorakhpur.  
  
Having said that, I don't know much of Jyotiṣa so if you want to be doubly sure, you may want to get in touch with some Jyotiṣavid in Varanasi. If you want, I can help you with the contact of Śrī Rāmādhāra Śarmā who will know for sure if there are any regions with a different reckoning of the Adhika month.  
  
Thanks, Nityanand
