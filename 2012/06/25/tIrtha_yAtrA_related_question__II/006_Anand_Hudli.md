Dear Shri Siva Senani,  
  
I looked at some North Indian (pUrNimAnta) calendars online, for example:  
<http://www.drikpanchang.com/> and  
<http://hindupad.com/2012/hindu-calendar-2012-with-tithi-pdf-download-printable-panchang-calendar-in-english/>.  
  
I noticed that bhAdrapada adhikamAsa begins on August 3, according to them. You are right. There is a Sankranti during the adhika mAsa. One can only speculate that there could be a requirement to "synchronize" the North Indian months with South Indian months.  
  
As you write, perhaps someone familiar with the North Indian Panchanga system can help.  
  
Regards,  
  
Anand
