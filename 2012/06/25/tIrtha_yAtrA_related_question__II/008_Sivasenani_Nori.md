Sir,



Thank you for the information. This resolves both Sri Anand Hudli's main question and my supplementary question. So, though there is a difference in how the normal chaandramaana months are reckoned in South (ending with amaavaasya)and North (ending with poorNimaa), there is no difference in how adhika-maasas are reckoned (they end in amaavaasya).



I guess, this is the reconciliation that Sri Anand was guessing. Extrapolating, there ought to be something similar for kshaya-maasas as well.



Best regards

N. Siva Senani
