Dear scholars,  
  
I have a related questions which is more general than the one that I asked earlier . If a person happens to be visiting a tIrtha, say Kashi Vishwanath, should he follow the customs of the local people or his own? For example, he may decide to get some pUjA done for the deity. Should he follow his own method (assuming he is allowed to do so by the temple authorities) or should he follow the local method? I have heard that as far as Pitru Karya is concerned, people prefer to get it done according to their own customs, not the local customs. Another related question is regarding certain sacred times. For example, he may happen to be visiting the tIrtha during Ashadha Krishna Paksha as per his own amAnta calendar, but locally it may already be shrAvaNa Krishna Paksha in Varanasi. Now, locally, shrAvaNa mondays are held sacred for visiting Kashi Vishwanath. But does it apply to the visitor? Does he also have to consider such a monday a sacred day, like the locals?  
  
Regards,  
  
Anand
