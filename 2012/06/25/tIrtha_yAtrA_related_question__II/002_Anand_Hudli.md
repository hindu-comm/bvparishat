Dear Prof. Korada,  
  
Thanks for your reply. I am aware that a tIrtha may be visited for the second (or subsequent) time during an adhika mAsa but not for the first time. However, the question I have is: how do we determine whether the visit occurs during such an adhika mAsa. Is it according to the temple's traditional Panchanga or is it according to the traditional Panchanga of the person who intends to visit the temple for the first time. In the example I gave earlier, the person who intends to visit Kashi Vishwanath (first time) may be following a different Panchanga (amAnta where months end in an amAvAsya) as opposed to the temple's own traditional Panchanga (pUrNimAnta where months end with a pUrNima). So he may end up visiting the temple when he thinks it is not during adhika mAsa, but according to the temple's tradition, he is, in fact, visiting during an adhika mAsa.  
  
Regards,  
  
Anand
