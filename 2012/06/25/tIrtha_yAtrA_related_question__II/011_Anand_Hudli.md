Dear Shri Misra,  
  
Thank you for the information. I am glad to know that the pUrNimAnta panchanga's adhika mAsa coincides with the amAnta panchanga's adhika mAsa. In that case, the question I posed earlier does not arise.  
  
However, I would like to know if this method of calculating adhika and shuddha mAsa (where the pUrNimAnta and amAnta adhika months coincide) is also followed everywhere else in North India, for example in Varanasi. It is interesting to note that the shuddha bhAdrapada mAsa is "cut" with an intervening adhika mAsa and the shuddha shukla pakSha does not immediately follow the shuddha Krishna.  
  
Regards,  
  
Anand
