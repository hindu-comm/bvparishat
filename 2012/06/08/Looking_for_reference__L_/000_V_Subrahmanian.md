Namaste  
  
On behalf of someone I am looking for the source of this verse:  
  
प्रतिभानं काव्यविद्याप्रचयपरिचयं वृद्धसेवानुरागं सतताभ्यासप्रयत्नं कवितेगे नियतकारणम् \[These are the invariable causes for a kavitA to be authored\]  
  
This is quite apparently a Kannada verse as some of the case endings of words and the highlighted word shows. But it must be having a Sanskrit source. I am looking for that Sanskrit source from which the Kannada poet could have adapted it. Could the source be of MammaTa or any other author?  
  
Any leads to locating this source would be gratefully appreciated.  
  
Warm regards,
