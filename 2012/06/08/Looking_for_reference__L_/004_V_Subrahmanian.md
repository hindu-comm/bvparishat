Thanks for coming out with references that echo the purport of the verse which I had cited. It looks like the concept of kAvya, irrespective of the language it is composed, has a common base. All authors who have written on kAvyamImAmsA seem to agree on the fundamental requirements a good Kavi has to possess.  
  
Scholars may still give their thoughts/references on the topic.
