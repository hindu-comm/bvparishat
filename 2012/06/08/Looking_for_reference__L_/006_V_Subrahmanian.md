Thank you Dr.Narayanan for the fine references and quotes. I am reminded of some of these references too in support of what your quotes convey in essence:  
  

-   *मूकं करोति वाचालं*, पंगुं लंघयते गिरिम् । यत्कृपा तमहं वंदे परमानंद
    माधवम् ॥

-   *कवित्ववाराशिनिशाकराभ्यां*  
    दौर्भाग्यदावाम्बुदमालिकाभ्याम् \|  
    दूरीकृतानम्रविपत्ततिभ्यां  
    नमो नमः श्रीगुरुपादुकभ्याम् \|\|(२)\|\|

-   महागणेशपञ्चरत्‍‌नमादरेण योऽवहं प्रगायति प्रभातके हृदि स्मरन्
    गणेश्वरम्।

    अरोगतामदोषतां *सुसाहितीं* सुपुत्रतां समाहितायुरष्टभूतिमभ्युपैति
    सोऽचिरात्॥

-   The Hastamalaka stotram that came out ex-tempore when the dumb boy
    was questioned by Shankaracharya. The work is so full of meaning
    that it is said that Shankaracharya Himself wrote a bhashyam for
    it.

-   The TotakAshtakam (विदिताखिलशास्त्रसुधाजलधे...) that the humble
    disciple Giri (of Shankaracharya) instantly sung being even mentally
    blessed by the Guru.  

-   मूकपञ्चशती

-   The legend about Kalidasa being blessed by Devi Kali by writing the
    bIjakshara on his tongue which marked the beginning of his poetic
    genius.

-   Many other such instances of Guru's/God's blessings that trigger a
    kavi's potential.  

-   There could be instances where one has practiced writing short poems
    and gradually ended up composing impressive works.

Interesting real-life cases can be reported.

Warm regards,
