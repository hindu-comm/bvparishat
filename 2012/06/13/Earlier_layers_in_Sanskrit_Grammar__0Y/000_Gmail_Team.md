Earlier layers and remnants in grammar of PANini.



Real Problem is VarNavaada versus Sphotavaada



Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



I agree with VKG that PANini system is the best thing to happen to Sanskrit.

I agree with DB that one need not expect PaNini to be comprehensive.



I apologize for using the word “attack” in my posting which changed the tone towards defending PANini. My problem is different and it is this.



We are told by Bhartrihari (Brahmakaanda) Sanskrit grammar is the “door of salvation”.

Patanjali says similarly that a single Sanskrit word expressed correct grammatically, helps in securing heaven.



Here I refer to two books (1) “Sanskrit Bhaas’echaa Ulagada” by Marathi researcher Rajawade and (2) “Sanskrit Vyakarana Shastra kaa Itihasa” by Yudhisthir Mimaamsaka. Both authors are from India.Nobody can doubt patriotism of both authors. **I am not following the line of thinking of the western thinkers**. This was explained several times by me on this list.



Both authors say that in the Sanskrit of Panini’s time there were remnants from the earlier different Dhatus and their grammatical endings. It shows clearly that Sanskrit was undergoing changes over the period of thousands of years before the time of PaNini (500BC). They are describing what was happening in the historical development of Sanskrit up to time of PANini. (Greatness PANini is not questioned here).



Sanskrit was not exception to the basic trends in linguistics-**information which is certain in the beginning tends to become uncertain with the passage of time and users of any language try to follow the Principle of Least Action.** Yudhisthira Mimamsaka also mentions these two trends in his books. PaNini helped in preserving language.



So the question arises if grammar of language has undergone some changes, then which is the correct grammar that will open door to the salvation? Vaidika grammar? But even before that there was different version, not entirely but certainly different in many respects. Please look at the both books listed above for prevedic Sanskrit.



In addition Sanskrit is the language of Hindu liturgy; Yajnyas are performed using Sanskrit mantras. If some of the letters from mantra words or grammatical endings have undergone changes then how could we guaranty their effectiveness in producing desired effects? By both methods of grammar and Yajnya if Yajaman gets fruits in the next life, then there is nothing to check. One has to keep faith. So it is a religion based on faith. I am saying this because 99% of Hindu population does not understand Sanskrit mantras. But they believe that Sanskrit has esoteric power. Where does this power come from? Certainly not from changing grammar!



Now only thing left is Sanskrit shabdas. I just finished reading the book “ Sphotasiddhi of Mandana Misra” written in English by Dr, (Mrs.) Usha Rathode of Delhi. Throughout the book it is said that according to Mandana Misra, the meaning of Sanskrit shabdas (padas) are conventional. There is nothing esoteric power in them. Power is in sphota. If Sanskrit is conventional language, then why can’t we use Marathi or Hindi or Telugu mantras? Why such a high status to changing Sanskrit?



To me only hope appears from the position of Mimamsakas (Kumaril Bhatta etc) who somehow repeatedly talking about phonemes referring to Upavars'acharya’s old theory. If meanings of Sanskrit shabdas are conventional, it makes no difference if it comes through sphota or not.



On one instant they say meanings of Sanskrit shabdas are conventional and at the second instant they stretch sphota to all the way to the spiritual Shabda-Brahman. Why does not this Shabda-Brahma percolates its esoteric power all way down to Sanskrit shabdas of Vaikhari making them intrinsically powerful instead keeping them conventional?



Authors offer four divisions of Sanskrit shabdas-Yougika, Yoga-rUdha, rUdha and Yougika-rUdha. Here rUdha means conventional. Does this mean esoteric power is attached to only Yougika words? If yes, then how? The only possible solution is through **letter-sounds**. And if that is discarded as **sphotavadins** do, then Sanskrit is one hundred percent like any other language, like Marathi, English. No high status.



It was also discussed on this list that Para, Pashanti, Madhyama are common to all languages. Nagesh takes sphota from Vaikhari back to Shabda-Brahman through Para, Pashyanti ladder. So great great very old grand daddy Shabda-Brahman blesses all languages with its esoteric power Then why Sanskrit deserves high status? Please correct me in my logic so that I can improve in my understanding of philosophy of Sanskrit grammar. Remember, if you **love** (and I do) Sanskrit, that is different story. Please pardon me for a long posting. Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
