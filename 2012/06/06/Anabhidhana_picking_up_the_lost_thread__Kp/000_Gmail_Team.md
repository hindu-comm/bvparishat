Respected Scholars, Namaskar!

  

I could not get time to continue the discussion on “AnabhidhAna” . Please pardon me for picking up the thread now.

In the book, “ NAgesha and The MahAbhAs’ya” by Dr. Meenambal Narayan, on page 232 it is said, “ AnabhidnAna is a technical device adopted by the Sanskrit grammarians to account for the absence of certain undesired forms which are otherwise contingent by the grammatical rulers and contradict certain uniformly accepted and established theories or form an obstruction to drawing certain conclusions,” Next examples are given of words “ yayI “ and”papI”. Here Nagesha points out that Patanjali has stated that there are no locative forms ending in I (dIrgha) and U (dIrgha) and existence of forms “yayI” and “papI” contradict this assertion. Hence it is better to accept “anabhidhAna “ of these forms. Hence there is no discrepancy in the statement that in the absence of the locative forms ending in I (dIrgha), the term extends to “gaurI” wherein the locative suffix has elided and that is what Patanjali implies by this statement.

Any thoughts further on this subject? Thanks. N. R. Joshi.
