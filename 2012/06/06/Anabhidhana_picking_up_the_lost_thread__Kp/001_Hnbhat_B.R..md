Dear Sir,

  

Thanks for giving the reference to the authorities on the subject.

  

Here is the earlier thread where the term was wrongly taken to be contrasting with abhidhAna and anabhidhAna in a different context. As I had pointed out, mostly you can find the use of this phrase in Mahabhashya itself profusely used to thwart away the undesirable forms though logically the rules permit.

and dwindled away from the focus of the discussion.
