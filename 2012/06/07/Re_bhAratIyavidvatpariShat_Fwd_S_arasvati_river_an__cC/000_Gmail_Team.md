Dear Dr.Rajaram, Dr. Bhagwan Singh and other scholars,



What is the place and time of Mahabharata in the history of Vedic civilization?





If you focus only on the ancient geography and ancient history of the subcontinent, you can create any picture you want. However when you step out just outside the western border of the subcontinent,one sees entirely different picture of the ancient India. Unless one settles the issue of Mahabharata history in the context of Vedic civilization and origin of Sanskrit, the story will not be complete.I had great honor to show my power point presentation on Mahabharata to Dr. Bhagwan Singh who is in Houston at present. He posted his impression on bvparishat about my presentation. I will write more about it later on shortly. As Dr. Yadu Moharir wrote here on bvparishat that we are our own critic and we show our work to people so that can find out errors in it. I told people go to library, find books that I referred to and see yourself whether my information is correct or wrong. More discussion on particular points later on. Thanks. N.R.Joshi

Namaste Vamadeva:



 By confirming our findings of 15 years ago, the recent PNAS (*Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, USA*) has brought our work into public focus, even in the popular press. Rajesh Singh in his report in *Pioneer* has even borrowed the title of my book (which he cites extensively) for the article title.
