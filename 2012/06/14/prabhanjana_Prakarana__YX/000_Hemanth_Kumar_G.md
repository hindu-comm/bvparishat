Namaste,  
 Does anyone knows about "prabhañjana Prakarana" of Bhagavata Purana. I searched and got to know that the word appears once in Canto 12.9.14. How many verses related to this are collectively called as Prabhañjana Prakarana which is used to do Paaraayana in some Shanti Prakriyaas? Information needed urgently.
