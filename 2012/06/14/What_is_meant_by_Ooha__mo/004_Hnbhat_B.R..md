Dear Sreekanth.

  

It is not the meaning of ऊह that Sri N R Joshi has inquired which need be provided from the Spoken Sanskrit Dictionary. Please go through his message thoroughly and reply precisely than producing Dictionary search results.  



ऊहः खलु अपि। न सर्वैः लिङ्गैः न च सर्वाभिः विभक्तिभिः वेदे मन्त्राः निगदिताः। ते च अवश्यं यज्ञगतेन यथायथं विपरिणमयितव्याः। तान्न अवैयाकरणः शक्नोति यथायथं विपरिणमयितुम। तस्मादध्येयं व्याकरणम्।

  

This is the concept of ऊह as popular in मीमांसा and as explained in महाभाष्य as Mr.Joshi has himself ascertained and wanted more details in this respect and not the word meanings of the word ऊह.

  

The precise answer in my opinion, to his last remark

ध्वनि and शब्द both mean physical sound as both are produced by friction of two physical bodies, either articulation of speech sounds or any sound like murmuring of leaves or well noted musical sounds of drums or any Instruments. In that it is alright.

  

According to न्याय school, they have contained both as physical entities, as अनित्य while मीमांसक-s hold it as नित्य as the revealed knowledge expressed in speech sounds. महाभाष्य doesn't have his own opinion as whether it is नित्य or अनित्य, or the relation as नित्य or अनित्य, but Panini's explanation is justified according to the suitable theory. Whether it is the Universals जाति the meaning of the words or व्यक्ति the individual is denoted by the words, आचार्य has to adjust to the convenient theory in his सूत्र-s.

  

मीमांसा has got its own values and न्याय has got its own values within their respective register (different from the dialect, but the the common use of the standardized language) of Sanskrit. This much was meant by Prof. Korada.

  

"सिद्धे शब्दार्थसंबन्धे" is the first view discussed in महाभाष्य in the very beginning of discussion on व्याकरण of पाणिनि.
