Respected Scholars, Namaskar!

I read the word "Ooha" many times. Could scholars of this list explain the exact meaning of this word please by giving examples?

In one book I read it as "modification" , in another, "substitution.



If we replace "Surya" in place of "Agni" in ritual mantra, will it be called "ooha"



According to Khanda-paks'a, padas have meanings. According to Akhanda-paks'a, sentence only has meaning. The question is where shabdas (words with no inflections) get their meanings? Is it Ishvara sanskrit or due to sphota or due to lettersounds. This is what I am interested. MImAmsakas believe meaning comes from letter-sounds.



As professor Korada has said in his book that the Sanskrit word, "shabda" is used in many context and hence it is untranslatable. In my opinion it has simple meaning based on physics of sound. There is difference between Naada and Shabda. Both are dhvanis. Thanks. N.R.Joshi
