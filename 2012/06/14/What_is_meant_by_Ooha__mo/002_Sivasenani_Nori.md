Within the domain of grammar, the distinction is clear. Pada is a word as we understand in English. सुप्तिङ्गन्तं पदम् - that which ends in a 'sup' or a 'ti\~N' is a word according to Panini.



Sabda has two definitions as given by Patanjali:



प्रतीतपदार्थकः ध्वनिः शब्दः। This is a working definition - applicable to vaikharee as per Nagesa - which makes meaningful wordsSabdas.



The other, more philosophical definition, applicalbe to madhyamaa according to Nagesa,which accomodates the concept of sphota is: येनोच्चारितेन सास्नालाङ्गूलककुदखुरविषाणिनां सम्प्रत्ययो जायते स शब्दः। The idea is like this. A word is meaningful only if the listener is aware of it. Let us say that I propose that our group of friends go to a tundra for a holiday. If my friends do not know what a tundra is, my statement does not make sense. If they know that tundra is a cold desert, then they can reply along the lines of: "Oh! why on Earth would you want to go to a place where nothing grows, and there is nothing to see" or "Yes, such great calmness would be very nice". So the words uttered by a speaker only trigger the sense that has already been acquired by the listener. Therefore, when one says गौः the image of an animal with a सास्ना (dew-lap in English, and గంగడోలు in Telugu, the loose skin hanging below the neck ofa cow), tail, hump, hoof, horns etc. arises in the mind of the listener, hence the definition: Sabda is that on whose pronunciation (or, manifestation) the correct knowledge of the object with dewlap, tail etc. is produced.



In Alankara Sastra, Sabda and artha are often differentiated and used together. There, the Sabda हरिः would be the grouping of ह्, अ, र, इ, विसर्जनीयः in that orderand artha of हरिःwould be Vishnu, monkey, bear, lion, horse etc. Kavya is most commonly defined as something which consists of Sabdas and arthas, has gunas, does not have doshas, is adorned with alankaras etc. So they accept the working level definition of Sabda - a meaningful word.



In summary, then, pada is any group of letters with a sup or ti\~N at end; if that is also meaningful, it is Sabda. Could we have examples please? Usually, non-sensical words are not supplied as examples of pada, but many of Panini's words would only be counted as padas outside grammar. Say, ल़ट् (or, लटि, लटः ... withwhichever vibhakti) would be quite meaningless outside grammar. There, that would count as a pada, but not as a Sabda.



At a higher level, Sabda is Brahman, as set out in the first five verses of Vakyapadiyam.



अनादिनिधनं ब्रह्म शब्दतत्त्वं यदक्षरम् ।

विवर्ततेऽर्थभावेन प्रक्रिया जगतो यतः । । १.१ । ।

एकं एव यदाम्नातं भिन्नशक्तिव्यपाश्रयात् ।

अपृथक्त्वेऽपि शक्तिभ्यः पृथक्त्वेनेव वर्तते । । १.२ । ।

अध्याहितकलां यस्य कालशक्तिं उपाश्रिताः ।

जन्मादयो विकाराः षड्भावभेदस्य योनयः । । १.३ । ।

एकस्य सर्वबीजस्य यस्य चेयं अनेकधा ।

भोक्तृभोक्तव्यरूपेण भोगरूपेण च स्थितिः । । १.४ । ।

प्राप्त्युपायोऽनुकारश्च तस्य वेदो महर्षिभिः ।

एकोऽप्यनेकवर्त्मेव समाम्नातः पृथक्पृथक् । । १.५ । ।



Translation of K. Raghavan Pillai from his book "The Vakyapadiya: Critical Text of Cantos I and II with English Translation, Summary fo Ideas and Notes" published by MLBD first in 1971.

1\. That beginningless and endless One, the imperishable Brahman of which the essential nature is the Word, which manifests itself into objects and from which is the creation of the Universe,

2\. which though described in the Vedas as one is divided on the basis of its powers, and although it is not different from its powers appears to be different;

3\. the indestructible powers of which functioning through the powers of Time become the six transformations, namely, birth and the rest - the sources of all (these) manifold objects,

4\. to which, Single One, the cause of all, belongs this manifold existence, under the forms fo the enjoyer, the enjoyed and the enjoyment;

5\. of that (Brahman) the Veda is both the means of realisation and the reflection and it has been handed down the great Seers as if consisted of many paths, althought it (really) is One.



Your specific questions have to do with the intention of the writer of those lines. For instance, I am more comfortable with the nirvacanam for a Sabda thanfor a pada, becuase by using the word Sabda - I am sure it has some meaning, but then sincepadasused by great people are inevitably meaningful, even padacould be used. In the latter example, if philosophicallyone holds that ultimately only vaakyaartha is real,then the temptation would beto use 'pada'so that we do not attach a meaning to it, which ties in nicely with one's thinking. Where Sastra begins with अथ शब्दानुशासनम्, Bhartrihari gave the title वाक्यपदीयम् to his book. Both acharyas are equally a model to follow.



In some of these discussions, from a different angle, it looks like splitting hairs. But then, I guess that ability to split hairs is what paaNDityam is about. At least a student of navya-nyaya would take it as a compliment.
