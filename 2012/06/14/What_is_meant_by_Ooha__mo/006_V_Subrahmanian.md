Thanks Shri Siva Senani ji for the beautiful analytical reply. I agree that we can't really be making strict compartmental divisions. For instance the yoga sutra शब्दज्ञानानुपाती वस्तुशून्यो विकल्पः where shabda is admitted to generate jnanam. In advaita, as you know, when we consider mahAvAkya-s like 'tat tvam asi' the Acharyas take care to say: तत्त्वमादिवाक्येषु प्रथमतः तद्गतपदानां अर्थः अवगन्तव्यः, पश्चादेव वाक्यार्थः समुदेति . That is why we have the तत्-त्वंपदवाच्यार्थ/लक्ष्यार्थ usage.    
  
I agree with your comment: //In some of these discussions, from a different angle, it looks like splitting hairs. But then, I guess that ability to split hairs is what paaNDityam is about. At least a student of navya-nyaya would take it as a compliment.//  
  
the justification being, otherwise why should there be two different words? Recently we saw how अङ्गद-केयूर were differentiated.

Thank you Deepak ji for your response.
