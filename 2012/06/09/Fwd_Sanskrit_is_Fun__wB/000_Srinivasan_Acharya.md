Dear Friends,



For nearly 35-40 years the following publications have been part of a chain of schools, **St. James Independent Schools** in **UK** as well as **Europe, North & Latin America, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand** so on and so forth. Unfortunately, **Sanskrit** has lost roots in its birth-place *&* is no longer part of school curriculum in India where it originated. Rather, ***Sanskrit is treated like a foreign language*** being grouped with languages like *German, French* etc.Therefore, it is our ***moral** & **social responsibility*******towork towards ushering in**"SANSKRIT RENAISSANCE"** in the *New Age*.



**1) SANSKRIT IS FUN (3 Parts)**

**2) STORY OF RAMA (2 Parts)**

**3) STORIES OF KRISHNA (2 Parts)**



Since ***Sanskrit is the heart and soul of India***, it is not only the ***mother*** of all Indian languages, but the source of all *Indo-European* languages. Moreover, ***Sanskrit does not belong to any particular race, sect or religion***. Such was the strong thematic expression of our *Honâ€™ble Prime Minister,* **Dr Manmohan Singh** during his deliberation at the *15^(th) World Sanskrit Conference* held at *Vigyan Bhavan*, *New Delhi* in *January 2012*. I strongly feel that without ***Sanskrit***, being the ***core origin*** of all languages,
it is virtually impossible to sustain the cultural and spiritual values of our homeland for which India is held in high esteem.

Warmest personal regards**
