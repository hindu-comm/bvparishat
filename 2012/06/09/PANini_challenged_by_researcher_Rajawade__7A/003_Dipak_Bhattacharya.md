\<I have read Dr. Bhattacharyas comment, but he has missed the point as the point raised was itself amiss\> Dr. Singh should stick to the context instead of going astray. I request him to go through the exact points raised by Dr. Joshi. His question was on the treatment of Panini by Rajwade and not on his originality. Dr. Singh misses that I replied to Dr. Joshi and not to him. His points have been raised anew after my letter. Naturally I stand by my observation. This is said without prejudice to the merit of Rajwade's thesis.
