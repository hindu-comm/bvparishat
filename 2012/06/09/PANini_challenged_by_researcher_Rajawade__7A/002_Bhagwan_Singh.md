Namaskarpurvakam,

It is a privilege that I have read the book in question - Sanskrit Bhasheca Ulagada - despite my questionable knowledge of Marathi,

so I may offer my opinion to be corrected by those who know more orbetter. Rajwade, analyzing the Paninian approach unravels

the past stagesof the development of Sanskrit language and unawares of the PIE reconstructions reconstructs the past stages of

Sanskrit language wherein he postulates three previous stages of commingling of people speaking different languages and specifies

changes brought about due to this social and linguistic cohesion. He uses Panini, explains the incongruities and specifies the governing

factors with his constructs. I wonder why none of the Marathi speakingSanskrit scholars did read and criticize and place Rajwade properly,

who in myreckoning shows deeper insight and is not driven by AIT or OIT compulsions.

He examines the data as objectively as is done in the field of natural sciences. The threeprevious stages to the Vedic are RaanaTii,

crude language, Ati JunaaT Vaidik, very old or formative Vedic, JunaaT, old Vedic followed by Vaidik of the extent t text. I have every admiration for NR

Joshi for focusing on this vital issue on which we had been sleeping for eight decades. I do not blame scholars for their ignorance who do not

know Marathi. But Marathi Sanskrit scholars are suspect for having passed over this giant silently, for easy rewards.

I have read Dr. Bhattacharyas comment, but he has missed the point as the point raised was itself amiss.. Rajwade has to be closely examined

and criticised, especially becausehe posed the three divergent speech communities within Aryan frame while they appear to be people from different

language families in popular terminology, joining a cultural stream trying to learn and speak/use the linklanguage, committing mistakes due to linguistic

indulgences or habits as we all do while learning a language, even after we have working knowledge of it.
