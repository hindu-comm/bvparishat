Respected Scholars, Namaskara!



**PANini challenged by the Marathi researcher Rajawade!**



It so happened , I came across a book written in Marathi. The title of the book is "Sanskrit BhAs'echA UlagadA" ( Analyzing Sanskrit Language). The author is well known Sanskrit scholar and ItihAsa Sanshodhaka
Rajawade (Marathi) from Maharashtra. In this book written in Marathi, the author describes three historical layers of Sanskrita--very ancient layer he calls PoorvaVaidika, second layerof Vaidika and the third layer the Sanskrit or BhAs'A of the time of PANini. He tried to prove that many rules of PaNinidid not explain properlythe left over remnants from previous layers.



In this book PANini grammar is attacked on almost every page. I cannot summarize all his objections to PANini grammar. So my question is this--Does anybody has opinion on this book from the community of scholars from bvparishat or any other scholars from the world including India? Loving Sanskrit is emotion, either personal or religious or national. Researching Sanskrit can be done without such emotions of reverence to the authors of Sanskrit grammar. Perhaps that seems to be the attitude of Rajawade.



Myresearch as explained on this list has to do with Phonemic Symbolism in Sanskrit Shabdas. So grammatical endings of Padas (which have definitely undergone changes over centuries) do not affect my research.



Now as far as old layersof Sanskrit in Sanskrit grammar of time of PANini, it is hard for me to judge for the following reasons. Different scholars offer different timings of PANini. I am reading the three volumes of Yudhis'Thira MImAmsa (Sanskrit VyAkaraNakA ShastrakA ItihAsa--History of Sanskrit Grammatical Science). Here author takes time of PANini to be two three hundred years after Mahabharata war of 3000 BC. He lists and descibes many out of 80 grammarians before PANini.



Please give your opinions on these books so that we can grow in our understanding of Sanskrit with your contribution. Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
