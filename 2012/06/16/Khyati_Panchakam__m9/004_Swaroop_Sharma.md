Namaste,

I thank Narayanan, Subramanya and Ganesh-ji for having helped me to know what Khyati is. Thanks for all the book references also. Ajit-ji, I am trying to acquaint myself with Indian thought system. I understand the necessity to have depth. Sorry if I am asking questions in patches and in an abrupt manner. Hope all scholars here bear with my ignorance and at the same time guide me to learn more :-)

Dhanyavad
