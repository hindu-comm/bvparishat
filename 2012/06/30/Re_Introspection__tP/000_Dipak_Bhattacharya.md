Why choose Kosambi alone? Why not H.Oldenberg, A.Hillebrandt, H.G.Wells and other arch racialist ‘Indologists’and historians apart from unacknowledged merchants of death like Winston Churchill?

Learned friends here below are two paragraphs from a chapter for your reactions.

**James Stuart Mill and the Great Departure**

This writer, it will be said, has never been in India; and, if he has any, has a very slight, and elementary acquaintance, with any of the languages of the East. Mill, HBI, *Preface*

We could have easily avoided this diversion from language to history, and any discussion on Mill, if at all necessary, could have been summed up in a paragraph as despite his knowledge of many European languages, including Greek, he knew no Indian language, much less Sanskrit. His opinion on Sanskrit places him closest to his dearest teacher, Dugald Stewart. ‘When he saw the striking similarity between Greek and Sanskrit, he jumped to the conclusion that Sanskrit must have been put together after the model of Greek and Latin by those arch-forgers and liars, the Brahmans, after Alexander’s invasion and that the whole of Sanskrit literature was an imposition’, which sent him to enviable popularity through Europe. Impact of his teaching was deep on the mind of Mill.[\[i\]](http://in.mg61.mail.yahoo.com/neo/#_edn1) What he said in his speeches was elaborated by Mill in two of his six volumes with equal cynicism. Mill was emulated in tone, temperament, line of approach but with slight shift in selection of pejoratives by D.D. Kosambi in his historical writings, who again became the model of the so called Marxist history-writing of Ancient India, that ruled the Indian academies for more than three decades till it was discovered by its votaries that grass is greener in America than in steppes and serving clerical cause was more lucrative than dreaming of revolutionary transformation. It may be educative to note that stung by praise of Sanskrit and Indian civilization at the dawn of history, Mill used adjective ‘rude’ 355 times, besides other choicest pejoratives heard in street quarrels such as eunuchs, dirty, cowards, slavish, arrogant, quarrelsome, which I preferred not to count, in the first two volumes of his *History of British India,* for Indians, while a good analysis could speak louder, clearer and with greater sensitivity to sustain him as a historian, sparing him the charge of being foul-tongued. Had he not been revived in his writings of Kosambi, setting the course of Marxist history writing in India, he could be remembered for other things but not as Historian, on which count he was condemned even by Macaulay. Any way the mind set of modern Indian liberal intellectuals is a legacy of Mill via Kosambi and that requires a self-examination on our part.

James Mill was factually correct, as Bhartrihari was in his *Vairāgya Ŝatak* when he depicts the human body as abode of diseases, urine, dirt, insects, etc., in short something that better be abandoned. Singular attention on the vices and infirmities can make anything abominable and turn notable into notorious. It judges more sternly the judge, rather than the issue involved. Leaving everything aside, use of foul tongue by a person sitting to evaluate civilization, and ridicule of sane and polite manners as feminine bounces back on the person himself. But such painful was the realization at that point of time when color prejudices were blinding among the whites that they are progeny of black Bengalies (entire India for them was reflected in Bengal) that every European, from fool to philosopher, had gone mad and equally foul in selection of epithets for those who just by a fact discovered by Europeans themselves appeared to be humiliating them even without themselves making any hue and cry. For us, therefore, the vices pointed out by Mill are not much important, as the fact that at this point of time the entire presentation of history and analysis of language was reversed and held fast by all the subsequent scholars irrespective of their training and expertise. The concept of PIE, to replace older or spoken variant of Sanskrit, was saving-grace-construct which can never be worked-out in parameters acceptable to West, towards which Indian scholars have been looking for recognition.

[\[i\]](http://in.mg61.mail.yahoo.com/neo/#_ednref1) At Edinburgh Mill took particular delight in the tutelage of Dugald Stewart, who carried on the tradition of Scottish moral philosophy. … The criteria according to which Mill judges and criticizes Indian practices and customs derive from the view of historical progress that he had learned from Dugald Stewart and John Millar, amongst others. *Stanford Encyclopedia,* revised article Jun 14, 2010.
