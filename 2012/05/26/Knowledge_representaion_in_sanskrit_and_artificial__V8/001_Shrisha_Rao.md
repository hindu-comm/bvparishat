Make no mistake, that paper is hardly a breakthrough in either Sanskrit or AI, never was. There is more to the well-worn E-R model of databases (and the E-R model already existed when the paper was written). It would probably also be better to compare knowledge representation models (which are fundamentally semantic in nature) with न्याय or मीमांसा (which also deal with semantics) rather than with व्याकरण (which deals only with word-level syntax). There is not much knowledge representation to be gained from the rules defining the correct forms of specific words.
