Apparently so. But please give a thought to the following!

*anāstika* would have been formed by P. 6.3.74 *tasmān nuḍ aci*. That Pāṇini himself has formulated another sutra, namely, 4.4.60 *asti nāsti diṣṭaṃ matiḥ* shows his disapproval of applying 6. 3. 74. Hence it is not a Pāṇinian position that *anāstika* is grammatically correct. We cannot regard it correct otherwise too. Assuming, for argument’s sake, that *tasmān nuḍ aci* is a universal rule, usage does not allow its operation in Sanskrit. Pāṇini himself knew *nāstika* to be the form in usage. So in Sanskrit only the word *nāstika* has been in use and not *anāstika*. It is this usage which determines which form is correct and not the assumed validity of any rule.

Dear Sir,

Technically speaking,anastikah is grammatically correct,but,may not be current in the language,hence, not much given thought to.Possibly,they wanted to avoid anavasthaprasanga.
