निषेवते प्रशस्तानि निन्दितानि न सेवते ।

*अनास्तिकः*श्रद्धानः एतत् पण्डितलक्षणम् ॥

  

In the above usage, अनास्तिकः seems to convey the idea that not being a नास्तिक, apparently the implied force that ever आस्तिक, and never becomes a नास्तिक. It is the usage that decides the meaning and application of the rules especially in the case of krit, taddhita and samAsa formations as the maxim suggests "अभ्रिधानलक्षणा हि कृत्तद्धितसमासाः". It can be said he could have directly said न नास्तिक or आस्तिक but it is विदुर-s speech in Mahabharata. In the same way, while for conveying the meaning नास्तिको वेदनिन्दकः

  

सर्वतः पापदर्शी च**नास्तिको वेदनिन्दकः**।  
संप्रकीर्णेन्दियो लोके यः कालनिरतश्चरेत्।। 12-166-8a 12-166\|

  

as in the above Mahabharata usage why should use अनास्तिक at all implying न आस्तिक as not being a नास्तिक. If context requires explicitly (or any implication), it may be accepted as in the first quotation above it is was used to negate and contrast with नास्तिक.
