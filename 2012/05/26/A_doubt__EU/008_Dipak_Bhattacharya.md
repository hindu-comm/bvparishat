I seems that the import of my reply was not clear to Sgri Namboodiri. I asked to stick to the prasanga ie context and not to digress. With tasmaan nu.d aci anaastika may mean only "not aastika" . This is unPaaninian. The discussion strictly referred to the position of Paa.nini and the usage in his environment. Whatever one may do at present that has happened after changes over millennia and is not testimony to Paa.nini's position.Hence there is no change in my position that Paanini could not take annaastika in the sense of naastika. This has not been disproved by Sgri Namboodiri who has digressed from the context.

I do not agree with sree DB.The word anaasthika can be taken in either  
way according to the context.  
(See, Interesting thing is-  
Some pronounce the sound N in anaasthika at barsvam to mean a  
non-existancialist, whereas at teeth to mean an existancialist.)  
So It is just accidental to happen the same word derived in two ways  
ie aasthika / anaasthika and naasthika/anaasthika.Compair with -  
aasaka/anaasaka and naasaka/anaasaka. Vyaakhyaanatho
