After a request by me to the Parishad Dr. Ajit Gargeshwari and Dr. H.N.Bhat gave me the addresses of a site and downloadable file for the Tantravarttika on the Internet. It is only today that I could download the Sanskrit version ed. G.N.Jha. The translation too has been downloaded but it requires to be redone. I hope that my attempts will be successful I am grateful to Dr. Gargeshwari and Dr. Bhat.

Bestr wishes
