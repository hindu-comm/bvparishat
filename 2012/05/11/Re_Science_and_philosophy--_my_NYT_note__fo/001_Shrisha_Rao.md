\> Acharya Madhva (1238 - 1317) asserted that reality is of two orders-- independent and dependent and both are real.  
  

That is quite misleading, to say the least; the actual statement is स्वतन्त्रमस्वतन्त्रं च द्विविधं तत्त्वमिष्यते; स्वतन्त्रो भगवान् विष्णुः भावाभावौ द्विधेतरत् -- the thesis that \*reality\* is of two types is a Buddhist tenet (द्वे सत्वे समुपाश्रित्य बुद्धानां धर्मदेशना, etc.) found in Advaita also, but is strongly denied by Madhva's doctrine: यादृशं ब्रह्मणो सत्यं तादृशं स्याज्जगत्यपि.  

  
\> Any experiment is part of the 'dependent' and not a full description (of the independent).  
  

Madhva's thesis is not about the empirical world, and must not be interpreted that way.
