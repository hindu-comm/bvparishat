Which, of course, begs the question of why the traditional precept should be even (mis)quoted, given that it is no longer considered relevant. It is more honest to simply posit whatever one wishes to, without attributing it to someone else with whom one disagrees.  
  
\> Also, I retain only the metaphysics and leave out the theology invoking Vishnu which has no relevance to physics. That is my choice.  
  
Even so, it is inaccurate to attribute to Madhva the position that there are two types of reality, which he explicitly rejects in several places. His statement has nothing to do with types of reality (the adjective, meaning the property of being real), and instead has to do with types of entities, all equally real, these being independent and dependent. This classification also should have no relevance to physics since one of the categories, viz., the independent, is not the subject of it -- thus, everything in physics is classified as dependent only.
