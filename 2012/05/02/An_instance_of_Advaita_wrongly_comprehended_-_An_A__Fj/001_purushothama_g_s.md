Namaskar,

  

I credit you for both the links. They contain some interesting arguments with copious references.

  

I wish to bring up the appropriateness of the post.

More so, I wish to solicit the response of the scholars on what is their opinion on the matter which is infinitely more important.

  

It is conventional tocriticise by using the 'kechit kaara' method.

This practice has been used by scholars since time immemorial.

  

Even if we were to consider an accidental reference or perhaps human error,

given that the post is on the death anniversary of therenownedlate scholar Sri Vidyamanyatirtha Swamiji,

it could possibly raise the question of slandering the dead.

  

  

I would like to point out that such posts could start an unproductive argument that would be, most likely, of no use to the esteemed members.

I present an example.

[nyAyAmRta - advaitasiddhi workshop, Bangalore](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/bvparishat/aCAGsz-TkeI/PUeZ2GSD128J)  

This was, thankfully, ended by the timely intervention of Vidwan VN Pandurangi. [Link](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/bvparishat/aCAGsz-TkeI/IbzbDxrCqIAJ)

  

  

  

I again request the scholars to decide on the matter, and would like to assure my complete compliance with their decision.
