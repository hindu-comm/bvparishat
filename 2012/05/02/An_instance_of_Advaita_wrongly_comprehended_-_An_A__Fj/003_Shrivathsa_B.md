hariH OM,  
shri purushottam,  
  
 mere questioning of somebody's opinion amounts to "slander of the dead"??? I request you to refrain from using such strong language.  
  
 There have been instances in the past in this group when many living and dead vidvaans' views have been challenged, nobody has ever called it "slander of the living / dead". Please don't become hyper-emotional. We have the highest respect for yatis, it is due to the respect we have for them that we wish to question some of their views.  
  
svasti,  
 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,  

shrivathsa.
