Sir,  
  
Thanks for your response. Let me clarify that my intention is not to 'slander the dead'. For, first of all, I am not aware that the timing of my post in this forum coincided with the death anniversary of the Swamiji. I have found that the method of 'kechitkAra', though impersonal and archaic, is less exact when it comes to detail. It is the method of all schools, especially in the present day, to give specific references to the exact works, the title, the exact sentences, and then comment on that, favorably or otherwise. Today, happily, the tendency is to ask: kena kutra kim uktam? In fact they are not satisfied with 'arthataH anuvAdaH' and demand the exact 'shabda prayoga' by the author. I followed that method only, to the extent possible, so that one will not be pointing to vague things.  
  
It is in this background alone even the various 'dvaita-advaita-vishishtAdvaita' meets are organized by institutions like the Purnaprajna samshodhana mandiram. There is no rancor. The attitude of 'challenging' someone to a debate is the thing of the past as the parties involved have realized its utter uselessness.  But there is the alert intellectual readiness to understand the opponents' view and form a counter to it, if any.  
  
Also, my posting this article in this forum is only by way of informing members, just as specific books are announced for the benefit of members who might be interested in them. This forum would be a wrong place to discuss, for example, certain aspects of a book whose publishing is announced here. I have taken Prof.V.N.Pandurangi's remarks in the proper stride and therefore have not intended this post of mine to be one leading to a discussion. That is the reason why I did not post the complete article but gave a link to it to a different source which can be a place where one could respond.  
  
I am not aware of a policy, if it is there, of this forum that only matters related to kAvya, tarka, pUrva mImAmsA and vyAkaraNa are permitted here. If someone brings to my notice such a policy I shall refrain from posting anything pertaining to Vedanta here, including announcements pertaining to books related to Vedanta.    
  
I value your sentiments and once again assure you and the forum that I do not intend to open discussions that border on sensationalism.  
  
Warm regards,  
subrahmanian.v
