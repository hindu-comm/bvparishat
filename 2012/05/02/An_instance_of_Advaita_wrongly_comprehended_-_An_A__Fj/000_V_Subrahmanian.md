Here is an article on the above topic.  
  
On page 13 of the document available at the following URL is a remark made by Late Sri Vidyamanya Tirtha Swamiji, the then Head of two Madhwa Mutts at Udupi:<http://xa.yimg.com/kq/groups/23451465/1302672952/name/sripalimaruswamiji1.pdf>

//Arjuna was given Divya chakshush (divine vision) when he was shown the Vishva Roopa by Paramathma. He saw the world also at the same time. He saw the wonderful world and the Supreme Being at the same time. Though Arjuna had Brahma Prathyaksha at the time, the world continued to be seen by him. Thus the statement of Advaita that after Brahma Sakshathkara, the world will cease to exist is wrong. Therefore, all the three Prathyaksha, Shasthra and Yukthi are valid Pramanas.//

For a Response to the above observation see here:
