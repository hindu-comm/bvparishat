dear shri subrahmanian, and others who joined the discussions

  

Shrividyamanyatirtha would be happy in his vrindavana if somebody is still trying to answer the questions raised by him on his aradhana day (though unintentionally). it was his breathing. being his disciple I know it.

  

**there is no problem in posting any relevent things in bvp. bvp is to discuss anything on and in sanskrit language. you are welcome.**

  

but please try not to create a division that has in past rendered our society inactive and ineffective in refuting modern challenges. **we have to be united and face the modern challenges together that is the policy of BVP.**

  

morover there is no use in criticing dvaita or advaita via this forum. you write something. other party will something. writing goes on going.

there can not be conclusion here in the net.

there is no way we can arrive at conclusion. 

that is why I ended the chain of last dicssions.

  

you cancertainlypost anything that is about new research and helpfull to all members. only thing we have to note is that things we post should not trouble members.

  

I request all the esteemed members to stop discussion on this matter.
