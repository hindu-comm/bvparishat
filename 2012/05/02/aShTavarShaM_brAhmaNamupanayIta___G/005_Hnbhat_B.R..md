It is in Manu 2.36. this word is used and just because of the sixth vowel should be long in the अनुष्टुप् and the commentator justifies this by simply quoting Paninian rule:

  

उपनयनमेव उपनायनम् - "अन्येषामपि दृश्यते" (६.३.१३७) इति दीर्घः।

  

Now to the question of Mr.Shreyas, while the मीमांसा texts refer to the line as श्रुति, there is no way of casting any doubt in their statement, even though we could not find and locate the source श्रुति they have quoted and elucidated by the writers of गृह्य and श्रौत- सूत्र which serve as the धर्मशास्त्र for us along with the स्मृति texts like मनु. I have quoted महाभाष्य also to this effect, which refers to as विधि in this case. गृह्य and श्रौत - सूत्र-s are nothing but laying procedures for the विधि-s laid down in the श्रुति, AND if they go against any श्रुति, they are discarded upholding the view of श्रुति.
