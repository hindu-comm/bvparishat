Namaste.  
  
According to this shruti passage: अष्टवर्षं ब्राह्मणमुपनयीत it is said that the age is calculated from the time of conception. Is there any clarification available on this? What is the period that is taken as 'living in the womb'?  
  
I find this in the Dictionary:  
  
*गर्भाष्टम*, garbhASTama, m. eighth year reckoning from conception, edit.  
  
I request the scholars to kindly clarify.
