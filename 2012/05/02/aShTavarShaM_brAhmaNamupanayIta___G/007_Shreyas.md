श्री:

Respected scholars,

Again, while most of these references from Smruti (or even vedAnga here) are fairly well-known, I am still intrigued at whether there is direct reference to गर्भाष्टमम् as the prescribed age in the Samhita /Brahamana of any Shaakha, extant or otherwise.

  
Thanks,  
-Shreyas
