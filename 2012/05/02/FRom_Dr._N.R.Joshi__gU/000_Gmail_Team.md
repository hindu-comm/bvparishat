Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



Meaning of " PashyantI " . I am talking in connection with ParA, PashyantI, MadhyamA and VaikharI.



In the dictionary of Apte, one of the meanings of PashyantI is given as a harlot. Could anybody explain etymology of this word and how Vaak variety could have any connection with a harlot. Am I wrong in reading dictionary? Please help. Thanks. N.R.Joshi
