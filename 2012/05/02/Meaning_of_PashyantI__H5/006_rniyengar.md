Dr.Bhat, Thnks for your elaboration which is very appealing. I have  
the following further observations which are not based on any textual  
traditions but are personal.  
  
As you have pointed out perhaps the RV hymn is the basis for the four  
divisions eventually leading to 'speech'. But your second point that  
'pashyanti is perception through sense organs' is not clear to me,  
unless you include 'mind' as a sense organ. I am under the impression  
'pashyantii' is independent of the Indriyas. Those who are unable to  
speak also have the faculty of 'pashyantii'.  
It may be crudely desribed as 'insight' even when the external sight  
is missing or absent.  
  
The four steps leading to Vikhari need not be restricted to  
articulated linguistic expressions only. For example silent NaaTya  
(mime) and paintings/figures are Vaikharii and they also pass through  
the other states.  
  
The case of Music (I mean classical) is very special. There is  
'shabda' not linguistically articulated always. The performer  
(instrumentalist)as well as the listener percieves some 'Jnaana' but  
this can not be expressed in 'words'. Hence 'Vaikharii' is not  
limited to 'speech sounds of a language', but is more general.  
  
I have no disagreement with what you have written but trying to see  
whether something more can come out of the discussion.  
  
Thanks  
  
RN Iyengar
