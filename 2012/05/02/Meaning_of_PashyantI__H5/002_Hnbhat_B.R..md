As for the etymology of the word पश्यन्तीpaśyantī is simple present participle from the verb दृशिर् प्रेक्षणे = to see (both in literal and literary sense as the verb corresponding in English, like I see a book (the physical entity held within the sight), and also I see (- I understand what is said or read). Hope this will explain the different usages popularized by conventions. Just like पश्यक - the one who sees, becomes कश्यपः - by metathesis. according to etymologists (not for grammarians). Thus there is difference between the Grammarians and the Etymologists (Nairukta).

  

In this connection, all the derived from the same need not have any connection between them as you seem to have raised the question. There need not be any relation between two at any rate, even though there may be some resemblance in some.

  

Just I can quote for the change of meaning of to see, to look as inEnglish. I am not sure of the usage, "to look at" has two different shades of meaning. To look at an object, like look here. The same might have lead the verb meaning to see in its present participle form. It is the physical aspect of "look at" than the critical view of a thing observed.

  

Monier William also gives as from Lexicon though he doesn't mention the lexicon where it is quoted.

  

Casting lusty looks at men, might have lead the usage of this participle in the feminine gender restricted to a harlot.

  

The critical view of the things of things observed enabling their corresponding words in the language is the faculty of speech called पश्यन्ती popularized by Tantric texts as the second stage of speech production or physical and consciousness combined called as such bestowing such quality as preparatory to audible sound production.

  

This seems to be the relation between the two concepts (rather two words) developed independent of each other. from the same word form derived from the same verbal stem.

  

There is another word for a thief:

  

पश्यतोहरः - one who carries away whatever he sees. it is conventionally used as a compound to denote a thief and not any carrier either human or any animal.
