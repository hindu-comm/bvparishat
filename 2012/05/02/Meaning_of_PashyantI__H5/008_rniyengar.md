Dear Sri Subrahmanian,

Your post is very interestingindeed!



As far as I could follow the अवस्थाचतुष्टयम् are धौतो घट्टित लाञ्छितो and रञ्जितः for the cloth. The correspondence on the otherside would be चिदन्तर्यामि सूत्राणि विराट्. So in this descriptionपश्यन्ती would correspond with Antaryaami. Am I correct? I have not read or studiedVedanta, (any of the three major branches)texts in the original. My knowledge is limited to Kannada and English books. Hence I realize I have to be careful even in formulating my question!

My question is: has VidyaaraNya Swami anywhere equated the Paraa, PashyantI, Madhyama and VaikharI with the above four? If yes, does this mean as per thePanchadashI, theविराट् is the Vaak of Paramaatman? In this model where does TIME come into picture? I can see that in the 'chitra-paTa' there are four *consecutive* steps and hence they happen one after another.In the case ofतुरीयां वाचो मनुष्या वदन्ति॥ ऋग्वेद १-१६४-४५ ॥**.****..** quoted by Dr.Bhatthere is timewise development (even if it be very fast) but in the case of 'Paramaatman (for sake of argument only!) all the FOUR seem to be always existing at best in a mutually dependent circular fashion!



Kind regards



RN Iyengar
