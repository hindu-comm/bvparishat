Namaste.  
  
Thanks Shri Narayana Iyengar for articulating some very profound thoughts. I am inspired to add the following to your current of thought so nicely expressed:  
  
Actually 'Creation' too can be seen to have these stages. One analogous situation has been presented by Sri Vidyaranya in the PanchadashI (chitradIpaprakaraNam):  
  
*यथा चित्रपटे* दृष्टम् अवस्थानां चतुष्टयम् ।  
परमात्मनि विज्ञेयं तथा अवस्थाचतुष्टयम् ॥१॥  
  
\[Just as one can see four 'stages' in (the making of) a painting on a canvas, so too one has to understand four states in the ParamAtman.\]  
  
The chapter goes on to brilliantly draw more correspondences between the canvas-painting and ParamAtman/Brahman. It is a treat to read this chapter. In fact one can say this chapter is a treatise on the Mandukya Upanishad.  
  
I am giving a few more verses of the above chapter, just as a sample:  
  

    यथा धौतो घट्टितश्च लाञ्छितो रञ्जितः पटः |
    चिदन्तर्यामि सूत्राणि विराट् चात्मा तथेर्यते ||२||
    स्वतः शुभ्रोऽत्र धौतः स्याद्घट्टितोऽन्नविलेपनात् |
    मस्याकारैर्लाञ्छितः स्याद्रञ्जितो वर्णपूरणात् ||३||
    स्वतश्चिदन्तर्यामी तु मायावी सूक्ष्मसृष्टितः |
    सूत्रात्मा स्थूलसृष्ट्यैष विराडित्युच्यते परः ||४||
    ब्रह्माद्याःस्तम्बपर्यन्ताः प्राणिनोऽत्र जडा अपि |
    उत्तमाधमभावेन वर्तन्ते पटचित्रवत् ||५||
    चित्रार्पितमनुष्याणां वस्त्राभासाः पृथक्पृथक् |
    चित्राधारेण वस्त्रेण सदृशा इव कल्पिताः ||६||
    पृथक्पृथक्चिदाभासाश्चैतन्याध्यस्तदेहिनाम् |
    कल्पान्ते जीवनामानो बहुधा संसरन्त्यमी ||७||
    वस्त्राभासस्थितान्वर्णान्यद्वदाधारवस्त्रगान् |
    वदन्त्यज्ञास्तथा जीवसंसारं चिद्गतं विदुः ||८||
    चित्रस्थ पर्वतादीनां वस्त्राभासो न लिख्यते |
    सृष्टिस्थमृत्तिकादीनां चिदाभासास्तथा न हि ||९||
    संसारः परमार्थोऽयं संलग्नः स्वात्मवस्तुनि |
    इति भ्रान्तिरविद्या स्याद्विद्ययैषा निवर्तते ||१०||
    One can see how in the creation of a painting or the Creation of this universe thereare stages that are varying in degrees of subtlety/grossness.  As you observed,
    a musician too passes his 'output' through this process while giving expression to 
    his creation.
    Regards,
