Thanks Prof.Iyengar for interpreting the term पश्यन्ती in a simpler way apart from the mystified Tantric concepts. I am glad to find a similar thinking person on these lines.

  

Apart from the elaborate explanations available in the Tantric Texts and Philosophy of Indian Grammar, a theory based on the Tantric and Vedanta concept, स्फोटवाद as expounded by the staunch follower of it, नागेश, I feel the same assuming these are the gradual stages of speech production resulting from the perception.

  

1\. The first stage is the pure conscience or consciousness which is a must for any speech activity identified as परा or नाद (according to a different school) and the later stages are related to the Six Cakra-s popular in योग and तन्त्र disciplines. That is how this concept is related to the speech production. This is not really a stage, but basic consciousness and called as such "त्रय्या वाचः परं पदम्" the gradual stages called as the three forms of the speech.

  

2\. The second is पश्यन्ती as the participle itself indicates, perception through sense organs. This is also common to all human beings and also animals along with the मध्यमा and hence the statement*चत्वारि वाक् परिमिता*पदानि तानि विदुर्व्राह्मणा ये मनीषिण: गुहा त्रीणि निहिता नेङ्गयन्ति तुरीयां वाचो मनुष्या वदन्ति॥ ऋग्वेद १-१६४-४५ ॥**.****..**

if the Vedic statement is taken to represent the 4 stages as described in later texts.

  

3\. The third मध्यमा - where is the perceived idea is converted into expressible units, between the articulated speech sounds. This is also common for human and animal beings. Only the difference is they have their own encoding to express their love, sorrow etc. to their fellow beings without articulated speech while human being has developed with the help of his gift of articulated speech faculty, a encoding system which is capable of expressing any idea through the speech sounds. This lead भर्तृहरि to declare:

  

न सोऽस्ति प्रत्ययो लोके यः शब्दानुगमादृते।

अनुविद्धमिव ज्ञानं सर्वं शब्देन भासते॥

  

As some argumentative scholar remarked, "I do not know " if one cannot express what one perceives and that too expressed in words.

  

As we can see, in this stage, the language systems differ with reference to the articulated speech sounds and their relation to the ideas perceived and expressed. The encoding sounds differ and encoding itself different, but many times concur. Because all perceive the same object, but express the same idea differently in different languages. This conversion to word images and images of idea-s take place in this stage between the audible speech and their visual and verbal images. बौद्धः शब्दः बौद्धश्चार्थः।

  

४. वैखरी is the audible speech sound articulated and as we are aware they differ and distinguishes the languages from the other. This is common to human speech sounds only.

"तुरीयां वाचं मनुष्या वदन्ति।". Yet this does not imply that all the languages are the same as they originated from the same source परा, as explained in the 3rd stage, which has got the stored images of visual and verbal images common to the particular language and the conversion to the corresponding verbal image takes place in the earlier stage itself, as English words, Sanskrit words or any language words with their sound system.

  

Hope this is the simplified explanation of the psychological process of the speech sounds of the language (in use written or spoken) without taking them as mystic explanations which takes a long way to understand the discipline where it is explained at length with other components.
