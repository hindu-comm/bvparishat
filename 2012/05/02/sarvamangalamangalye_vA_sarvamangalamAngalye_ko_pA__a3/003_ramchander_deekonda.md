Thank you very much for your kind explanation. Please forgive me for writing incorrect sanskrit. In this context let me inform you, I am not a scholar like yourselves. This is what I have give in my introduction to the parishat while joining the group. I am a sanskrit lover. I am a learner. I am attempting to write in sanskrit with difficulty. I do commit mistake. Please do not discourage anybody with such harsh expressions. Please correct. I did not find fault with anybody. Since I heard the sloka in both ways, I wanted to know which one was correct.
That is all. Who am I and what is my status to find fault in age old verses. Did I find fault with anybody. In case you feel I have made a blunder by attempting to write in sanskrit, please advise me to stop writing. You have thrown all your learning on a poor fellow.  
  
Thanks for your scholarly exposition. Please be kind with seekers and do go through my introduction to the parishat.
