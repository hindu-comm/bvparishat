You were asking for correct reading. It means you were searching for errors in one of those readings.

What shrI bhat said is that before trying to find errors in those things(which are uttered by purohita, etc.) you should try to improve errors in your present uses.

In case of सर्वमङ्गलमाङ्गल्ये you are doubtful. But, the sentences you are using reflect that you are thinking them correct. So, he tried to turn your attention to your present uses.

Again here what I think he meant is that you should be more cautious about your present knowledge and uses than about unknown or unclear things.

I can understand this.

But, if you see history of shrI bhat's posts, you will understand that how much he exerts himself to help others. So, a person who comes to help you after being asked for, must have privilege to point errors (with a motive to help improve you).

Hope, you understand that you are to learn here and you asked for help. He helped and without being asked he tried to help in areas where you were determined about lack of fault.
