Please, do not take things personally. If a scholar points an error,  
then it's for your benefit. You are not able to point out yourselves.  
And, if a scholar, who is pointing them, chooses to not show them to  
you to remain polite, then you will be either never be able to improve  
or it will take years.  
Moreover, When you read Sanskrit Scriptures, you will find that  
commentators never spare anyone for any mistake, be it small or big.  
So, a person like shrI bhat, who is adept in shAstra-s, is prone to do  
the same because he has learnt it from guru-s and books to not accept  
errors.
