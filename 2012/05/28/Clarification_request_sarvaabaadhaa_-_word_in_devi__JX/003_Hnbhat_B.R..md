On a second thought, I though if I misunderstood the question after your explanation.

  

There are both the possibilities -

  

सर्वाबाधाप्रशमनम् and also सर्वाबाध-प्रशमनम्।

or सर्वबाधप्रशमनम् or सर्वबाधप्रशमनम्

  

without change in the metrical structure.

  

in which case, the question is valid about the बाधा and बाध unless one knows that the word is in both genders. In any case, now its clear the word is सर्वाबाधा without the necessary for the question.
