This is a request for grammar calrification on samasa related to the  
word sarvaa-baadhaa in the saptashati verses and the correct reading  
of the popular prayer of devi. Two readings as available are provided  
below :

Reading 1: सर्वाबाधाप्रशमनं - त्रैलोक्यस्याखिलेश्वरि  
(As seen in printed books, including Gita Press, Krishna das,  
Chowkamba et al. Notice the deergha in sarvaa -baadhaa.) The main  
sloka is in 11th chap- 38 th verse -Saptashati.

Reading 2 : सर्वबाधाप्रशमनं त्रैलोक्यस्याखिलेश्वरि  
Notice the missing of deergha in the first word. This is what I  
have heard.

Clarifcation Requested : What is the justification, if any, for the  
samasa related to ' sarvaa-baadhaa - prashamanam ?

Is there a shortening of the sarvaa shabda in samasa and pumvat  
bhaava ? as suggested by some one ? If the issue is the streelinga  
of the word 'baadhaa' then how should one explain similar words like  
- 'sarva-shakti', - 'sarveshwari' ?

What is your reading, justification, grammar point on this saptashati  
patha please.
