नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

There will be two kinds of प्रयोजनम् for this (or any other such) याग - दृष्टम् and अदृष्टम् ।

  

There were heavy rains on three days during and after the याग ।

  

It was a काकतालीयम् / coincidence --  

  

the temperature had come down from 43 C to 17C within 2 hours on 7th day and the जन्झावात brought down a large portion of   महावेदि - on one or two channels there was the discussion in progress between साम्प्रदायिक s and हेतुवादि s .  
Again there was thunderstorm on 10th day and the 13th (within 15hours of शालादहनम् ।

  

As was predicted गरुड s (vultures) made प्रदक्षिणम् , on and around यागशाला and it was beamed live by many channels .  

  

The people thronged and enjoyed the य़ाग because the Andhra Pradesh Govt spent many millions of bugs for Cloud Seeding , which did not yield any result even once .

  

The य़ाग would have its effect on crops , atmosphere , on the minds of people and universal शान्ति ।

  

The याग is meant for universe and not for the State etc. .

  

There is nothing wrong in trying to have a so called Scientific Study but you may note the following --

  

responding to a question - how Veda is प्रमाणम् ? - अक्षपाद , the author of न्यायदर्शनम् - offers this सूत्रम् (2-1-68) --

  

मन्त्रायुर्वेदप्रामाण्यवच्च तत्प्रामाण्यम् (go thru the Bhasyam and Prasannapadaa , ग्रामकामो यजेत etc is discussed)

  

During ancient times (even today it is there in some places across India ) मन्त्राः were being employed as antidotes , i.e. against the poisons of snake etc..

  

The other one is आयुर्वेद - take up just one solution to deformed limbs , offered by Susruta and being followed by Surgeons across the globe - Plastic Surgery .

  

Aksapada asks - when you accept Ayurveda as authoritative then why not Veda , which is also offered by

ऋषयः who are मन्त्रद्रष्टारः ?

  

In this context I add a similar thing - Patanjali's योगानुशासनम् is being followed by billions of people across the Globe and they are not blind .

  

How come these Scientists could / can not compile a matching work ? Where is the Science ?

  

Today the Science , including Medical , became more destructive rather than constructive .

  

Let us not discuss the false Economy , especially in Europe and Western Hemisphere .

  

During the याग some TV channels asked me to prepare for चर्चा with
हेतुवादिन्s - okay , चर्चा , विवाहः and युद्धम् can be with equally qualified . Unless they study वेदाः , वेदाङ्गाः, दर्शनानि and without considerable command upon संस्कृतम्, what do they discuss ?

  

I also asked their policy on आयुर्वेद and योग ।

  

If everything can be decided on प्रत्यक्षम् how come the Scientists have not been able to stop aging and death till today ?

There were some Scientists who did some experiments , for example - what kind of effect will be there on seeds / saplings etc. . The results may take some more time to see .

  

In Panjal , Kerala(2011 April) also it was proved by Scientists that pesticides / insecticides etc can be replaced by यागधूम ।

  

It means you are controlled and cannot control !

  

The result will be of two types - दृष्टम् and अदृष्टम् ।

  

The result for the यजमान will be अदृष्टम् - cannot be seen now and here .

  

Please go thru any श्रौतसूत्रम् - सत्याषाढस्य / कात्यायनस्य / बौधायनस्य ... you will have answers to some questions .

  

Please do not trust so called scholars like Max Muller , who are cheats and conspirators .

  

Believe in ऋषि s who are ascetic .

  

I cannot advise anybody to approach any बाबा / स्वामी etc. , . They do not sit down with Gurus and learn Veda etc. but try to eke out their livelihood thru unfair means .

  

If one is really serious about such an investigation then he should become a योगी and things can be perceived thru योगिप्रत्यक्षम् \|

  

धन्यो’स्मि
