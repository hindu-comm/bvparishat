Dear Prof Korada,



Thanks for sharing information on Atiraatra Yaaga. I cannot open the attachment to your posting. Could you please let me know the program to open it? Thanks.



Is it possible toestimate outcome of Yaaga for Yajamaana or for public of India? Webecame hard science people. We feel to improve what we see with our eyes instead of focusing on esoteric that we do not see, hear. Esoteric rituals create all kinds of different interpretations by different gurus, swamis, holy people and even by scholars. That is why my question on outcome of Yaaga. Please do not misunderstanding us. We love Indian culturebut in a different way. N.R.Joshi

I have participated in the same and my responsibilities were - fixing the land , thru measurements , for the construction of यागशाला , i.e. प्राचीनवंशः , सदस् and महावेदिः , supervising the digging of ponds , guiding transportation of त्रेता (three Agnis) and other material from Trissur, Kerala etc.



Preparation of day to day detailed program for the Press, offering commentary in Telugu , Hindi and English and recitation of Veda etc. were also my duties .



A book on यागः is under preparation .

धन्यो’स्मि
