Respected Scholars

  

I am trying to recollect a shloka that was composed by someone while listening to the noise made by the birds just before the Sunset.

  

Liberal meaning - It looks as though birds are doing a "snadhyaavandanam"

  

Thank you all in advance,

  

Best regards,

  

Dr Yadu
