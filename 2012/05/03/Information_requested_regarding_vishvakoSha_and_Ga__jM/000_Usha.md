Respected Members, namaste. Could any one of you please tell me what the full / official / other name(s) of (Saṁskṛta) Viśvakoṣa is and where I can find an soft / hard copy? I have been looking for one for a long time now. Also could anyone know where I can find a Devanāgari copy of Gautamīya-tantra (also known as Gautama-tantra)? Thank you very much in advance.
