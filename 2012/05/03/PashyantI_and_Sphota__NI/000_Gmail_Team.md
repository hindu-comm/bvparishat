Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



First I would like to thank, Dr. H.N.Bhat, Dr.Narayan and Dr. Rama Karan Sharma for giving detailed explaination of the word "PasyantI".

Thanks to Mr. Vijnasu who posted



"PashayantI with respect to your question is the Sthara where the  
decision will be made about the Aakaara to be given for the Moola  
Naada originated from ParA."



Now confusion about the meaning "harlot" is removed. However my interest in Sphota doctrine directed me to ask the question. I call this mystic explanation of Sphota. Any further comments are welcome. N.R.Joshi
