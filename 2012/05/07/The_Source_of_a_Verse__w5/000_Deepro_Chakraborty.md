Respected scholars,

Please help me to find the source of this verse:

अङ्गानि वेदाश्चत्वारो मीमांसा न्यायविस्तरः।

पुराणं धर्मशास्त्रञ्च विद्या ह्येताश्चतुर्दश॥

Somewhere it is mentioned that the verse is taken from the Manusmrti.

But I couldn't trace it in the Manusmrti (with Kulluka's commentary) which I have.
