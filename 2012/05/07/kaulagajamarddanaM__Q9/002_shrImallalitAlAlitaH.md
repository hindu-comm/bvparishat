This is useful information. Thank you.

As far as I know, there is no other work titled as kaulagajamardana registered in catalogs I saw. Wherever it is mentioned, it has author kAshInAtha written.

But, what I get from MSS is that the author is kR^iShNAnanda yati.

See here :

<http://bit.ly/KGJRoH>

All sources confirm that it was written to refute kaula-mata, so is the MSS.

Anyway, I've no access to the mentioned Journal. So, I can't say anything more.

We will need some proof to support saMnyAsa of kAshInAtha to kR^iShNAnanda-giriH.
