Regarding Kashinatha one can get more information from the scholastic article : "Kashinath Bhatta and his works" contributed by Sri Chintaharan Chakravarty in the Journal of Asiatic Society of Bengal-Letters, 1938, pp.455-65. Kashinatha was the author of a text by name Balabodha, which teaches the shakta rituals.  
But I doubt whether the learned author says that Kashinatha Bhatta (who lived in the 17-18th century at Kashi) took samnyaasa and that he was known as Krishnananda.
