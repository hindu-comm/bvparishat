न

च अयत्नप्राप्ये वस्तुनि विद्वान् यत्नमातिष्ठति; '***अत्के चेन्मधु विन्देत*** किमर्थं पर्वतं व्रजेत्। इष्टस्यार्थस्य संप्राप्तौ को विद्वान्यत्नमाचरेत्' but with a difference in the rest of the part. The meaning of अत्क is given as the traveller by Monier Williams, here it may mean co-traveller. When co-traveller is having honey, why should one go up to the top of the mountain to get the honey? अत्क may be literary meaning. The reading अक्क also has got another meaning:

  

अक्कः A corner of a house; अक्के चेन्मधु विन्देत किमर्थं पर्वतं व्रजेत् । as per VS Apte, quoting the same line of Nyaya and the meaning for अत्क is also given as the same in the same line.

  

The same line is quoted as अर्के as from **अर्के**चेन्मधु विन्देत ŚB. on MS..It may be the same line os Shankarabhashya with the different reading. But the full form is not given. for MS.

  

All the three readings are possible and the meaning is the same totally ironical, while when a thing can be accompoished, why should one exert extra effort.
