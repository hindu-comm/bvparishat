hariH OM,  
VS sir,  
  
 in the book "sandarbhasUkti" written by shrii ra\~NganAtha sharmA published by kAvyAlaya mysore, the nyAya has been given as:  
"atke cEn..."  
  
 the meaning of "atke" has been given in that book as "antika", "samIpa". The meaning being, why would one go to a mountain if honey is available nearby.  
  
 "akke" (in the room of one's house) and "arke" (in the arka plant) have been given as pAThAntaras. while the former is understandable, the latter seems to give the nyAya an ironic twist.  
  
svasti,  
 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,
