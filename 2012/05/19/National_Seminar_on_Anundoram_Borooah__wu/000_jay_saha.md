Respected Scholars,

  

With immense pleasure let me inform you that there is a national seminar on 'Contribution of Anundoram Borooah to Sanskrit' on 21st and 22nd May at Cotton College organised by Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan. For the first time we are going to have an occasion to celebrate the birthday and the contributions of the great son of Assam in such a befitting manner. Eminent scholars from various parts of the country will join the seminar.

  

yours sincerely

Jay Saha
