No idea.a-mantram akṣaraṃnāsti -

  

The idea is plain in the line. There is no*akṣara*that cannot be used as a *mantra.*

  

Futher oner can elaborate either *mantra* or *akṣara*or even a independently with different concepts from different sources independently on these terms, but the idea of this is clear. The management of resources (whether it be human, or natural) is important to get the most advantage and this is the purpose of this verse as is emphasized in the fourth paada.
