Dear Dr. H.N.Bhat,



Thanks for explaining Mantra. I have a couple of simple questions. Please help. Could any single syllable be used as Mantra for japa?
Could meaningless syllable be used by the reciter? People using languages other than Sanskrit could they use syllable from their language for jap? Some other religions do not have concept of PraNava. But they have some kind of god in their religion. So they cannot use PraNava to concentrate. Is their special place for Mantras composed in Sanskrit only? or will Mantra in any language produce the desired effect?



Prof Korada mentioned about Mantra for reducing effect of poison of snake bite in his recent posting. Does such Mantra produce effect due to its special combination of syllables or is it due to power of the individual using the Mantra? Tantras talk about spells (Mantras like rhAm, rhIm,klIm etc) for jAraNa, MAraNa, Stambhana, VashIkaraNa etc. If they work then could I say that they work without referring to the God? Because God cannot be part of such bad karmas. Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
