Thank you for writing me personally. I think I am not competent to answer all of your questions. Hence forwarding your message to the group for further analysis of your questions with my attempt to reply them within my limits.

That is what the verse raised for for the topic of this thread says:

  

अमन्त्रमक्षरं नास्तिa-mantram akṣaraṃnāsti - which obviously states that there is not any syllable that is not (used as) a *mantra.*

This question has to be dealt with a different stand point of view as it is not within the scope of the शास्त्र-s which justify the above statement in general, but the question is raised from a trans-cultural and trans-language point of view. Hence it could not be answered shortly yes or now straight forward. But this is an attempt to answer your questions free from the limits of शास्त्र-s and each शास्त्र-s have their own register of language Sanskrit. They are valid within their registers and not universal even within the Sanskrit Language. How can their meaning could be taken to be applicable to the concepts of another culture and another language? This is a way of pointing out your question to have a clear focus.

  

As for the topic in question, and the statement in it as made clear in my reply to your first question, it falls within the scope of*mantraśāstra*and the statement cannot be expected to be valid within another register of Sanskrit language, for example मीमांसा. According to मीमांसा, Prof.Korada has made his position clear in his statements about the success of the rites prescribed in the Veda-s.

  
मन्त्रे तीर्थे द्विजे देवे दैवज्ञे भेषजे गुरौ ।  
यादृशी भावना यस्य सिद्धिर्भवति तादृशी ॥

  

This is within the bounds of मन्त्र or मन्त्रशास्त्र or तन्त्र as the above statement makes it clear, the success is dependent on your attitude or aptitude towards it, which can roughly be equated with faith, belief, religion etc. which are their own cultural content within English language, while भावना has got the same meaning as explained in the योगसूत्र Prof, Yadu Mohineer has quoted and explained in it tajjapas tadarthabhāvanam - contemplation on the referent of the प्रणव (in the case of YogsUtra in question). This is the basis of the statement of Prof. Korada referred to by you in your question below which is within the scope ofमन्त्रशास्त्र.

Hope this has already been answered in short in my reply to your previous question. The same quotation answers your question.

Now your question differs from the concept of previous one in that much that God is an English or probably originated from some PIE -

  
GodO.E.god"supreme being, deity; the Christian God; image of a god; godlike person," from P.Gmc.\*guthan(cf. O.S., O.Fris., Du.god, O.H.G.got, Ger.Gott, O.N.guð,Goth.guþ), from PIE\*ghut-"that which is invoked" (cf. O.C.S.zovo"to call," Skt.huta-"invoked," an epithet of Indra), from root\*gheu(e)-"to call, invoke." But some trace it to PIE\*ghu-to-"poured," from root\*gheu-"to pour, pour a libation" (source of Gk.khein"to pour," also in the phrasekhute gaia"poured earth," referring to a burial mound; seefound(2)). "Given the Greek facts, the Germanic form may have referred in the first instance to the spirit immanent in a burial mound" \[Watkins\]. Cf. alsoZeus.  



So it has different connotations in different language as the Etymological dictionary entry gives. While the concept of इश्वर is different in different शास्त्र-s according to their view propounded relating to ईश्वर within Sanskrit Language itself, though the word God originated from PIE can roughly translate the idea. Thus, मीमांसा theory holds the rites independent of God, yields fruit due to the अदृष्ट which is the fore-runner of Karma theory. Each of Six Darshana-s have different views about the concept of इश्वर and thus मीमांसा is called sometimes नास्तिक not accepting God along with सांख्य, and न्याय (though later it accepts along with वैशेषिक the concept of ईश्वर from its parellel). This has been detailed in every study about Indian Pilosophy and beyond the scope of this message box.

  

Now you can reconsider your proposal and you will find different answers from each of the Darshana-s and शास्त्र-s.

  

The point referred to in my message was to the concept of ईश्वर within योगशास्त्र and which is not even considered as existent in its pair साङ्ख्य as both do not consider शब्द as a valid means of knowledge. Even दृष्ट and अदृष्ट one of them अदृष्ट is taken up by मीमांसा also and to refer to धर्म and अधर्म good and bad deeds by न्याय philosophy. Within

  

Now according to those who accept ईश्वर, as the inspiration for each acts, good and bad, he inspires them according to their accumulated कर्म वासना क्लेश (different terminology used in different contexts) and is not directly responsible for their results. This is the reply to your question following the theory of कर्म and taking the ईश्वर as the mediator between the karma-s and their results done by each person. Now without his mediation, मीमांसा credits the अद्ष्ट responsible for the results. Now, coming to मन्त्रशास्त्र and तन्त्रशास्त्र, each मन्त्र has its own देवता different from the concept of ईश्वर or western concept of God, and it is the responsibility of the concerned देवता to yield the result according to the successful completion of the required rite. Hence God or ईश्वर is not directly responsible as you have proposed.

  

  

So it follows that any "*mantra"* will have its own meaning within/without the scope of the register of Veda, or मन्त्रशास्त्र. There are two views prevalent in respect of the knowledge of the meaning of *mantra-*s. Those who defend the knowledge of the *mantra-*s used for any rite, within the limits of the शास्त्र, whether it be मन्त्रशास्त्र or मीमांसाशास्त्र, swear the knowledge is necessary to yield the fruit>

  
"यदधीतमविज्ञातं निगदेनैव शब्द्यते ।

अनग्नाविव शुष्कैधोन तज्ज्वलति कर्हिचित् ।।" इति

  

in respect of Veda-s, and in मन्त्रशास्त्र also:

  

मन्त्रार्थं मन्त्रचैतन्यंयो न जानाति साधकः।

शतलक्षप्रजप्तोऽपि तस्य मन्त्रो न सिद्ध्यति ।।

  

the knowledge of meaning of the *mantra-*s are mandatory for the success सिद्धि of the *mantra*.

  

  

Now within a general view, free from the above concept, just भावना is important, and सिद्धि will be mandatory on completion of the required repetitions both in the case of सिद्धमन्त्र and साध्यमन्त्र also. सिद्धमन्त्र-s are to yield results immediately on their recitation and साध्य-mantra- need the completion of the procedure for their सिद्धि. They are inherent in the syllables and whether the does know the meaning or not, it should be practiced with dedication to yield fruit desired, just like the fire, whether knowingly or unknowingly, touched will burn with which it comes to contact. Only it need to be kindled with fuel and it will burn anything if fired against or made use for one's own purpose. The phase

  

अग्निमीडे would mean the same even if it is recited ईडे अग्निम्, but the order अग्निमीडे makes it मन्त्र and recitation willl yield the fruit of वेदाध्ययन. This is another view. This has been explained in मन्त्रब्राह्मणयोर्वेदनामधेयम् by which वेद is confined to the order of the text aas earlier cited in my previous message.

  
१,१५     यदि मन्त्र अर्थ प्रत्ययाय अनर्थकम् भवति इति कौत्सो अनर्थका हि मन्त्राः\|

  

  
१,१५     तद् एतेन उपेक्षितव्यम् नियत वाचो युक्तयो नियत आनुपूर्व्या भवन्ति

  

The above quotation is from निरुक्त, which Yaska rejects the above view later.  
  

The Puranic episodes cite the story of Ajamila, even if he called his son by his name, Hari even without meaning it the lord विष्णु he was taken to वैकुण्ठ. The concept is emphasizing on the faith than intellectual content.

  

Whether all the mantra-s whether they consist of sentences, words or syllables have the meaning is a different question. Even हुम्, फट् will have their meaning, just like the interjections in English or any language, to express one's feelings, like contempt, pleasure etc.Whether by denotation they convey the meaning or just accidental is another question. And knowledge of them is another question as discussed above.

  

Hope this much is clear. Further explanations are expected from the scholars specialized in different शास्त्र-s.

  

Sorry for the lengthy message.
