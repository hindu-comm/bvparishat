The sUtra is trying to say about प्रणव as suggested by Narasimhacarya and it says about meditating on ईश्वर who is the referent of प्रणव - by सूत्र you quoted.

  

य़्S_१.२८(३३)  तज्जपस्तदर्थभावनम्.

       भाष्य १.२८(३३    प्रणवस्य जपः = प्रणवाभिधेयस्य, च .ईश्वरस्य भावनम् \[अभिधा\]

It is specific on the annotation of "ईश्वरपणिधानाद् वा" the meditation on ईश्वर as one of the means to चित्तवृत्तिनिरोध.

  

It is beyond the focus of the सुभाषित cited as I can think of it. And its emphasis is only the identifying any syllable for the purpose of मन्त्रसिद्धि to be utilized as a "mantra" of any syllable and not limited to the syllable of ऊँ which is the focus of the above quoted सूत्र of पतञ्जलि as the भाष्य on it makes it clear. Both have focus point independent of each other as I can see.
