*  
Amantram aksharam nasti,Nasti mulam na aushadham;*

*  
Ayogyah purusho nasti,Yojakah tatra durlabhah:*

Meaning :  
There is no letter in the scriipt that is not a mantra, a chanting, a principle; what we need is *a Pandit, a scholar* to pronounce it. There is no root / plant without medicinal value; what we need is *a doctor* to diagnose it. There is none in this world who is *ineligible, inefficient, ineffective*; what we need is *a MANAGER* who manifests it. We therefore approach the young minds with firm belief within that they are ***ayogyah nasti***. The entire curriculum, the pedagogy, the activities and the events, the projects and the programmes, the resources and its recurrences are all designed and devoted in this Department of Business Administration and Research of Shri Sant Gajanan Maharaj College of Engineering, Shegaon to manifest their innate and infinite potential. The department endeavors to emit desired behavior (**ASK**) in its inmates for shaping their **A**ttitude, enhancing their **S**kill and building **K**nowledge by inculcating in them the culture of **A**sk, **S**eek and **K**nock (**ASK**).
