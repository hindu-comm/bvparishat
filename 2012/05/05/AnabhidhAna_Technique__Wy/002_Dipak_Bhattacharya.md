5.5.12

Dear Colleague,

Over the last few years the topic has been severally discussed in this forum under different forms of enquiry and answer.

According to Pāṇinians the conjugational ending may mean the subject or object or the intransitive verb (P.3.4.69). Whom it does not mean (*anabhihite*) takes the nominal endings enjoined under P. 2.3.1. This is the simplest statement of the Pāṇinian position. 

The concept of *anabhidhāna*/*abhidāna* engendered a huge literature beginning with Patañjali and later revived by the Mīmāṃsakas and Naiyāyikas and continuing till the eighteenth century. One may consult Renou or S. C. Vasu for the preliminary ideas and the Śābdabodhamīmāṃsā by N.S.Rāmānuja Tatacharya for most of the debated points. This work requires some previous traditional training. As for myself, I do not think that the problems have all been solved.

Best
