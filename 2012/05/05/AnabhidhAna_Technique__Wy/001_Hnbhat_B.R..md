This use of the phrase in the मीमांसा श्लोकवार्तिक -

  

धूमोऽयं ज्वलतीति न भवति ।

अनभिधानात् ।

न हि लोकऽ पर्यनुयोक्तुमर्हति ।

  

meaning it अनभिधानात् means लोकेऽनभिधानात् as the popular usage is to be given importance over the शास्त्र in practice. Though the smoke is burning is a grammatically correct sentence, but is a non-sense as it is never used in practice as impossible. Only fire can burn and not the smoke. You cannot accept such sentence as authority. This is also meant by its अनभिधानात् in grammar texts.



A key note. This is not the licence for using any form one can conceive as grammatical or ungrammatical, but just a way of explanation for the use of the correct usage of grammatically well formed ones. As I have mentioned above, if one asks, why I could not use उष्णक for room heater and शीतक for refrigerator, or airconditioner, Patanjali won't have any answer nor me.  

This is the guide line for the coining of new terms today.
