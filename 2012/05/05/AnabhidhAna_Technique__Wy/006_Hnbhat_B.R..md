In other words, the "अनभिहिते" rule discusses the possibilities of the कारक being conveyed by other suffixes than the case-ending suffixes prescribed for each कारक and this has a technical aspect in the rules under this अधिकार. Bhattoji, specifies the possibilities as अभिधानं च प्रायेण तिङ्-कृत्-तद्धित-समासैः and some times by निपात-s. It restricts the use of कारक-vibhakti-s to the cases not covered by अभिधान by the items listed above. In those cases, अभिहिते तु प्रथमैव -

  

Just like रामः कटं करोति - the first case. of अभिधान and अनभिधान of कर्तृ and कर्म कारक by respectively by the conjugationa suffix. रामः is the case of कर्तृकारक conveyed by ति and अभिहिते प्रथमा। The कर्म-कारक is not अभिहित by the suffix ति as it is used to convey the कर्तृकारक. The reverse is the case in passive voice:

  

रामेण कटः कृतः/क्रियते - Here the ति conveys the कर्मकारक and hence अभिहित कर्म - कट takes प्रथमा, and not द्वितीया। On the other hand, the कर्तृकारक is अनभिहित and hence in this case, it takes तृतीया. This is the scope of अनभिधान in the context of the Grammar under this rule and it appears it is from the अनभिधान on which the question was raised.

  

It is different from the शब्दवृत्ति called by the name अभिधा or अभिधान which is the domain of semantics mostly discussed by the texts in न्याय and मीमांसा though both differ in their views of the syntactical relation and शाब्दबोध, which also differs for व्याकरण also in the discussion concerned. This has been the topic of शाब्दबोधमीमांसा of Prof.NS Tatacharya which is a valuable tool as a ready reckoner for scholars. Accordingly taken up by the literary critics who followed आनन्दवर्धन who added ध्वनि, as a शब्दवृत्ति which was synchronized with other theories of meaning prevalent in the above said शास्त्र-s, अभिधावृत्तिमातृका, शब्दशक्तिप्रकाशः, वृत्तिवार्तिकम्, etc. independently.

  

I think the question raised by Mr. Joshi, as अनभिधान technique in grammar is different from the limited scope of अनभिहिते rule and the relevant theories अभिहितान्वय and अन्विताभिधान concepts developed by मीमांसा school taken up by न्याय school also.

  

There is one more maxim

  

"अभिधानलक्षणा हि कृत्तद्धितसमासाः" which needs attention of the discussion and the अनभिधान concept raised by Mr. Joshi.

  

Thanks to Bhattacharya and Narayanan for contributing to the topic with some more elements.
