dear all, one of my friends who is working on "Yuktabhavadeva" ( is a treatise on yoga)  

needs some info on two books quoted in it.

  

sivayoga is quoted there. we know shivasamhita. but there some verses which are not available in sivasamhita.

  

similarly gorakshanatha is quoted many times. but do not find these quotations in gorakshasataka. what other works of gorakshanatha are there to find?

ततः स्वधर्मं कीर्तिं च हित्वा पापमवाप्स्यसि।।
