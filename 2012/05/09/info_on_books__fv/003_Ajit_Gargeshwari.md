# Yogi Heroes and Poets: Histories and Legends of the Naths By David N. Lorenzen, Adrián Muñoz

# The Alchemical body siddha tradition in medieval India By David G white

Recent studies by Mark Dyczkowski, alexis Sanderson, Teun Goudrian and Sanjukta Gupta may be reffered. Many studies on nirguni sects such as those of Kabir, Dadu and Nanak also contain valuable information on Naths. Another related book may be Matsyendra samhita.

An excellent study of Gorakhnāth and the Kānphaṭā Yogīs is found in Shashibhusan Dasgupta's *Obscure Religious Cults*, 3d ed. (Calcutta, 1969).

George W. Briggs's earlier work, *Gorakhnath and the Kanphaya Yogis* (1938; reprint, Delhi, 1973), is full of information but is somewhat disorganized. It contains a translation of a version of the *Gorakṣa-śataka.*  

Also valuable, with an excellent bibliography, is Mircea Eliade's *Yoga: Immortality and Freedom*, 2d ed. (Princeton, N.J., 1969). The *Siddhasiddhānta-paddhati* has yet to be translated into English, but it is summarized by Kalyani Mallik in her introduction to her collection of Sanskrit texts, *Siddha-siddhānta-paddhati and Other Works of the Nātha Yogīs* (Poona, 1954).  

Hazariprasad Dwivedi's study in Hindi, *Nāth-sampradāy* (Varanasi, 1966)
