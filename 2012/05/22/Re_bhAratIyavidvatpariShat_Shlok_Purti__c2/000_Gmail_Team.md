Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



Many thanks to Dr. Sadashiva Murthy Rani, and Dr. H. N. Bhat by giving detailed reply to my questions on MantrashAshtra. You both are ocean of knowledge. Dr. Rani if you find new things on your Mantra shastra research, please let bvparishata know about it. I thank you Prof Korada on explaining his ideas on ArirAtra yaaga and its benefits. A couple of years ago there was discussion on effects of AtirAtra yaaga (that took place in Kerala). Some body was reporting about generation of intense heat due to Homa in yaaga, something like laser light etc. Also some effects on seeds, plants, environment etc.

Now if the yajamAna gets benefits in his life it is of subjective nature and one cannot measure or guess it. One has to trust his story. On the other hand if it rained due to performing yaagam then it is a physical effect. Now a physical effect cannot happen without physical cause or alterations in the physical conditions of the surroundings. This can be only confirmed by performing the experiment repeatedly and looking for similar effects.

I agree with the paragraph where Dr. H.N.Bhat talks about MImAmsA and no role of Ishvara etc. I just finished reading the book, “Introduction to The PUrva MImAmsA by Pashupathinath Shastri (edited by Gaurinath Sastri). In the book there is discussion on Nirishvara and Seshvara MImAmsA. My purpose of reading such books are two fold. I am interested in historical developments of ideas in Indian philosophy. Secondly I find new Sanskrit words and their meanings discussed by different Sanskrit scholars. I check meanings of these words against my theory of the phonemic symbolism based on acoustic properties of Sanskrit VarNas present in those words (Shabdas and not Padas).

If anybody knows any book that gives Mantras on nullifying effects of snake bytes, removing fever of Malaria, please let me know. I am interested to know what shabdas are used in such Mantras.

O. P. Bharadwaj’s (Indian Hindu author-no Maxmuller etc) book “ Studies in the Historical Geography of Ancient India, “ page 204 presents Richas from Atharvaveda for dispelling off Malaria fever. In those Richas it is said “Let Malaria go in the direction of Mahavris’as, Gaandhaaras and Vahlikas. The author says the name Mahavris’as appear only in Athavaveda. Could a richa with names of the countries around Indian subcontinent have MAntric power? Such names of countries appear in Rigveda also. This topic was discussed before on bvparishad in connection with Apourus’eyatva of Vedas with no definite conclusions. Anyway Mantrashaastra is very old tracing its origin to Vedas whose origin is lost in fog of the very ancient history of the world. Please pardon me a bit long posting. Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
