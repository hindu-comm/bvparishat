Pravargya is an *iṣṭi yāga* performed in course of the Soma sacrifice not as an *aṅga* but as an independent rite before or after the *upasad* for three days before the *sutyādina* ie the day of soma-pressing. Three pots used in it are called *mahāvīra*. *gharma* is hot cow- and goat-milk that is mixed with ghee and then offered. For more detail see the *Śrautapadārthanirvacana* by Prabhudatta Agnihotrī or the *Yajñatattvaprakāśa* by Cinnasvāmiśāstrīgal. One may also see the second volume of the History of Dharmashāstras but many details are lacking. The Śrautakoṣa account is so detailed that one may be confused. Hillebrandt (*Rituallitteratur*) gives an account in German but he is very inaccurate. Recently J.E.M. Houben (Sorbonne) has worked and is still working on the pravrgya ritual and its history.
