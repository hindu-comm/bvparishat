In the discussion of Atiratra, we were enlightened about many details  
of the ritual.  
  
Can anybody please throw light on the following things as referred in  
the Vedas :  
1. Pravargya, Mahavira and Gharma---- what was their usage and made of  
which material?  
2. Parishasau  
3. Ekashringa  
4. Rishya  
  
with respect,  
tapati sinha
