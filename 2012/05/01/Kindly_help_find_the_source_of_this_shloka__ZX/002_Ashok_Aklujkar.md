Read विशिष्टेऽपि, vi;si.s.te 'pi, 'even in the case of a thing with distinction, even in the case of an excelling object.'

  

There is usually no such thing as ideal translation. A translation's being good or ideal depends on who the intended recipient is. The second line conveys that, although one would expect a Prayaaga-resident to bathe in the holy / most holy confluence of Ga:ngaa, Yamunaa and Sarasvatii, he takes all his baths near a well (that is convenient to him).

  

In English, too, there are sayings to the effect that those who dwell at the foot of a mountain are the last ones to climb it.

  

Source? As in the case of thousands of subhaa.sitas, if we are lucky we will find out the source one day.
