It may be helpful to look at the variant readings recorded and the sources listed by Sternbach in the Mahāsubhāṣitasaṃgraha, nos. 574 and 575 (which is what Śrī Iragavarapu Narasimhacharya has quoted above in this thread). (No. 576 is another verse beginning with the same words.) Perhaps this link will work:
