Sutras permit to do Upanayanam in 5th year also (lower limit). One has  
to see the Guru bala for Upanayanam. Garbastama is the upper limit,  
after which the acceptance level of brain decreases. So in the latter  
case also the gurubala should be seen.

\> May 3,2012 Respected Scholars, Namaskar! There is discussion about time of Upanayan-7yeras and three. The timing of Upanayan may have to do also with astrological SHUBA time, year for the boy. Knowledgeable astrologers on this list are requested to voice their views on this aspect of timing. Thanks. N.R.Joshi
