Dear Sir,

This verse in the metre arya is from the Hitopadesa, but not from the Pancatantra, I'm afraid. It is the sixteenth verse, as it reads:

गुणिगणगणनारम्भे  

न पतति कठिनी ससम्भ्रमाद् यस्य।  
तेनाम्बा यदि सुतिनी  
वद बन्ध्या कीदृशी भवति॥१६॥

While one notes the group of the people having quality, the chalk will not fall from whose hand out of excitement (he who has born in a good clan, who is never treated as dead). So, if the mother is having a son, then tell how the mother can be a barren woman.  

The idea of the bracketed portion in the meaning of sixteenth verse has been taken from the fifteenth verse, as follows:  

  

स जातो येन जातेन याति वंशः समुन्नतिम्।  
परिवर्तिनि संसारे मृतः को वा न जायते॥१५॥

  

Regards,

Narayanan
