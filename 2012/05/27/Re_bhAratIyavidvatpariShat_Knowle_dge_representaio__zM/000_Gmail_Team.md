Shrisha Rao,

"There is not much  
knowledge representation to be gained from the rules defining the correct forms of  
specific words."



Thanks, articulated well. And grammatical forms of many Sanskrit words have undergone changes. There is a long list of this in the Hindi book, " History of Sanskrit VyAkarana ShAstra" by Udhis'thira MImAmsaka. Semantics of Sanskrit Shabdas is more interesting. N.R.Joshi

Make no mistake, that paper is hardly a breakthrough in either Sanskrit or AI, never was. There is more to the well-worn E-R model of databases (and the E-R model already existed when the paper was written). It would probably also be better to compare knowledge representation models (which are fundamentally semantic in nature) with न्याय or मीमांसा (which also deal with semantics) rather than with व्याकरण (which deals only with word-level syntax). There is not much knowledge representation to be gained from the rules defining the correct forms of specific words.  
  
Regards,
