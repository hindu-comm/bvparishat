Dear Members,

  

I deem it fit to write a few words about Dr. K.Aravinda Rao, whose mail is forwarded to the list. This, i am sure, will inspire young readers of our list.



I am indeed very much happy to read the mail from Dr.K.Aravinda Rao, IPS, Red DGP, now residing in Hyd. Thanks to Dr. JSRA Prasad for taking interest in forwarding the mail to the list. The list is benefited. I know Dr. Aravinda Rao for many years whose inner pravritti was always towards Atma-vidyA. Being a successful IPS officer even after attaining the office of the DGP of AP state, he was working for his PhD in upaniShatsu j\~nAnasvarUpam. His interest in promoting Sanskrit has a great impact in AP state. Many of his ideas to promote Sanskrit and well as Shastric studies are very much practical. I am much benefited by many interactions with him. 

  

Now he is fully active in the studies and promotion activities of Sanskrit and allied subjects. I on behalf of BVP and on my own behalf welcome him to the group.

  

Dr. Aravinda Rao comes from a different community. He is an exemplary personality for all of us. The BVP community lokks forward to his contributions.

  

warm regards,

shrivara
