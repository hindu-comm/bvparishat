Respected scholars,

Namaskarah.  

The Kāvyatattvālokaḥ of Dr. Sugyan Kumar Mahanty published by Professor Harekrishna Satapathy, the Vice-Chancellor, the Rashtriya Sanskrit Vidyapeetha, Tirupati, 2010, Pages: 287, Price Rs. 210/-, is being reviewed here.  
  
The Kāvyatattvālokaḥ is composed in Sanskrit language which covers the major principles of literary criticism including the definitions of poetry by different rhetoricians. Dr. Mahanty feels that this work will serve a definite purpose of feeding to the inquisitiveness of the scholars who are involved in the study and research on the Oriental and the Oxidental literary criticism.  
  
The Kāvyatattvālokaḥ is divided in ten chapters. Each and every chapter review the thoughts of different schools of the literary theory with a view to criticising both the oriental and the oxidental thoughts. The theory of generalization is one among those thoughts. Dr. Mahanty reviews the Indian literary theories like: the concept of śabdaśakti-s including abhidhā, lakṣaṇā, vyañjnā and tātparya etc. followed by the concept of kāvyātman and the various schools of rasa, alaṅkāra, vakrokti, aucitya, dhvani and rīti. Dr. Mahanty finds, as an instance, comparison in categorizing the poems of Professor Ezra Pound with Mammaṭa's threefold division of uttama, madhyama and avara. Professor Pound categorizes the poems as: logopoeia, phenopoeia and melopoeia (Principles of Literary Criticism, p.150).  
  
Dr. Mahanty analyses the dhvani theory of Ānanadavardhana on the context of the sphoṭa theory and explains the four states of speech called parā, paśyantī, madhyamā and vaikharī. Moreover, the author who is having wonderful poetic talent, has abridged all those theories in the form of excellent twenty-nine kārikā-s which have been appended towards the end. An exhaustive Bibliography of the Oriental and the Oxidental literary works, including books, journals in different languages of Sanskrit, English, Hindi, is also appended.  
  
The Kāvyatattvālokaḥ of Dr. Sugyan Kumar Mahanty is a tool of a unique platform for the study of both the Oriental and the Oxidental literary survey. This work is composed simply in Sanskrit supposed to help the Sanskrit students in India who do not have a practice of regular reading of English books regarding literary criticism. Those who feel as Sanskrit language is better easy to follow, rather than the phrase meanings and idiom of any foreign language, will definitely like this work. Exceedingly, I felt as a friend and colleague since over the last eight years, Dr. Mahanty's activities have utmost been dedicated to Sanskrit Literature. Apart from his scholarship in Sanskrit, he is well a singer, an excellent orchestrator, a dancer with regular practice.
