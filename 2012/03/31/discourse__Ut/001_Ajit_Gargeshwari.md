**Vāk** or **Vāc** (stem *vāc-*, nominative *vāk*) is the Sanskrit word for "speech", "voice", "talk", or "language", from a verbal root *vac-* "speak, tell, utter".

[](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Saraswati.jpg)

  

Vāk is often identified with Sarasvati  

Personified, Vāk is a goddess; most frequently she is identified with Bharati or Sarasvati, the Goddess of speech. In the Veda she is also represented as created by Prajapati and married to him; in other places she is called the mother of the Vedas and wife of Indra.^([](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V%C4%81c#cite_note-vacref-1))

In the Rigveda (books 2 to 7), *vāc-* refers to the voice, in particularly the voice of the priest raised in sacrifice. She is personified only RV 8 and RV 10, in RV 10.125.5 speaking in the first person (trans. Griffith)

  

The intimate connection with speech, sacrifice and creation in Rigvedic thought is expressed in RV 10.71.1-4:

1\. *bŕhaspate prathamáṃ vācó ágraṃ / yát praírata nāmadhéyaṃ dádhānāḥ*

*yád eṣāṃ śréṣṭhaṃ yád ariprám âsīt / preṇâ tád eṣāṃ níhitaṃ gúhāvíḥ*

2\. *sáktum iva títa'unā punánto / yátra dhîrā mánasā vâcam ákrata*

*yátrā sákhāyaḥ sakhyâni jānate / bhadraíṣāṃ lakṣmîr níhitâdhi vācí*

3\. *yajñéna vācáḥ padavîyam āyan / tâm ánv avindann ŕṣiṣu práviṣṭām*

*tâm ābhŕtyā vy àdadhuḥ purutrâ / tâṃ saptá rebhâ abhí sáṃ navante*

4\. *utá tvaḥ páśyan ná dadarśa vâcam / utá tvaḥ śṛṇván ná śṛṇoty enām*

*utó tvasmai tanvàṃ ví sasre / jāyéva pátya uśatî suvâsāḥ*

RV 8.100:

10\. *yád vâg vádanty avicetanâni / râṣṭrī devânāṃ niṣasâda mandrâ*

*cátasra ûrjaṃ duduhe páyāṃsi / kvà svid asyāḥ paramáṃ jagāma*

11\. *devîṃ vâcam ajanayanta devâs / tâṃ viśvárūpāḥ paśávo vadanti*

*sâ no mandréṣam ûrjaṃ dúhānā / dhenúr vâg asmân úpa súṣṭutaítu*

Vak also speaks, and is described as a goddess, in RV 8.100:

10\. *yád vâg vádanty avicetanâni / râṣṭrī devânāṃ niṣasâda mandrâ*

*cátasra ûrjaṃ duduhe páyāṃsi / kvà svid asyāḥ paramáṃ jagāma*

11\. *devîṃ vâcam ajanayanta devâs / tâṃ viśvárūpāḥ paśávo vadanti*

*sâ no mandréṣam ûrjaṃ dúhānā / dhenúr vâg asmân úpa súṣṭutaítu*

RV 1.164.45 has:

*catvâri vâk párimitā padâni / tâni vidur brāhmaṇâ yé manīṣíṇaḥ*

gúhā trîṇi níhitā néṅgayanti / turîyaṃ vācó manuṣyā̀ vadanti

**Logos**: is an important term in philosophy, psychology, rhetoric and religion. Originally a word meaning "a ground", "a plea", "an opinion", "an expectation", "word," "speech," "account," "reason,"^([](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logos#cite_note-LSJlogos-0)) it became a technical term in philosophy, beginning with Heraclitus used the term for a principle of order and knowledge.

Ancient philosophers used the term in different ways. The sophists used the term to mean discourse, and Aristotle applied the term to refer to "reasoned discourse"^([](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logos#cite_note-PaulRahe-3)) or "the argument" in the field of rhetoric. The Stoic philosophers identified the term with the divine animating principle pervading the Universe.

After Judaism came under Hellenistic influence, Philo adopted the term into Jewish philosophy.^([](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logos#cite_note-cdpPhilo-5)) The Gospel of John identifies the Logos, through which all things are made, as divine (*theos*), and further identifies Jesus as the incarnation of the Logos.

Although the term "Logos" is widely used in this Christian sense, in academic circles it often refers to the various ancient Greek uses, or to post-Christian uses within contemporary philosophy, Sufism, and the analytical psychology of Carl Jung.
