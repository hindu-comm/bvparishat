Dear scholars,



It is a really comical situation. I am reminded of a saying in vernacular, about thieves quarrelling among themselves. The media that is creating hype about the mobile, is patently fradulent; because \[1\]the media itself is airing dayi-in and day-out obscene visuals; and doling out in colour print obscene pictures in advertisement; which is seen even by children; \[2\] the media is silently endorsing transmission of such porn material by agencies, which are not in the hands of the legislators of Karnataka; \[3\] that it has not decried against and condemned the Central Govt. which is responsible for the transmission; \[4\] that the porn sites hach and pop up even in individual computers. Why does the media connive with them?



But the legislature is idiotic. They are idiotic and are not mature enough to pay the media in theio coin. Hence they deserve the treatment they have got.



As far as we are concerned; I think we should condemn both the groups equally for their sins; perpetrated on the viewers \[us\] uninvitedly.
