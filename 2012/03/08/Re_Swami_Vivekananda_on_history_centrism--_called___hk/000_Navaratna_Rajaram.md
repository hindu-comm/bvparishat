 That is why Sanatana Dharma is ***apaurusheya--* not of any purusha*.*** The same should be true of good science. Newton's Law of Gravitation does not stand on the authority of Newton just as Einstein's Theory of relativity would be true even if Einstein had nothing to do with it.



 They just saw these eternal laws. In Vedic language they were ***drishtaras.***



 Jesus (real or fictitious) is the *purusha* of Christianity just as Muhammad is the *purusha* of Islam. I have discussed it in some detail in the first section of my book ***A Hindu View of the World.***



 Rama and Krishna were expounding eternal truths (like scientific laws) and hence apaurusheya. I plan to do a column on this for FOLKS.
