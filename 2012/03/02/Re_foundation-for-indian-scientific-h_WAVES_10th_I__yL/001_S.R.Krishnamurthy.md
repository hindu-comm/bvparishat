My dear KrishnaKumar,



While I do appreciate your initiative, and that of Dr. Hemanth, I want you to appreciate that during these times when there are hardly a few who really concern themselves about Vedas, or study thereof, any effort by anybody at any quarter need not be suppressed. That is the Aarsha way. Any seed of enquiry must be nurtured. Once the seed sprouts, it might grow into a mighty bunyan tree. Therefore, from that angle, I consider it our duty to lend support to any effort at improving the understanding of the Universal Truths.



We cannot judge every activity by its efficiency quotient only. In that case, the only course advised by the Rishis, is Sanyaasa; as the Great Adi Shankara has shown in his exposition of the Upanishads. Such Ideals, though highly laudable, are not easily practised. Hence we have to put up with the lowest common denominator; and work up for the Highest standards. ***saha veeryam karavaavahai*** is our pratigna; not naishkarmya. Sri Krishna has advocated ***'ma te sangostvakarmaNi'.* No vedic Rishi would recommend that. That has not been our practice.**



**Anyway, persons like you and Hemant should start your style of Ghostis. That is what I suggested. Such efforts need not come in the way of others pursuing their way. People who see both the efforts will automatically choose what is better. We must realise that Vedas themselves have declared that all will not realise the naked Truth.**



**That is why I wanted you and Hemant to do something positively than crying foul of what others do, which is most futile. I will lend what support I can to such positive efforts. It is not that I am unaware of how things are going on. But our crying hoarse is no solution.**

**That is one of the naked truths, we have to accept and proceed.**



**In a confusion, I have left back your card at Bangalore. Kindly give me your mobile no. so that I may call you.**



**Yours fraternally,**

**s.r.krishna murthy.**
