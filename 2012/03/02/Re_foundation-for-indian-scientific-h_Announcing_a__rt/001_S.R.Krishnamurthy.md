Respected Dr. Kalyanaraman,



खे रंहतीति खरः॥ ख is space. ramhati is fleets. So what fleets in the space is Khara. This is the sense in which Valmiki has used to indicate that Ravana travelled by aero-plane from Lanka to Marichaashrama. The descriptions are very graphic; that even primary school children answer the descriptions when i posed a question, as aeroplane, without hesitation. Yet it is a wonder that our scholars at BARODA ORI deduced the word as donkey going by Amarkosha.

yours fraternally,

s.r.krishna murthy
