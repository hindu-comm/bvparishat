Dear Professor Korada Subrahmanyam,  
 You may remember a criticism of Paniniâ€™s grammatical system by Max  
Muller and Whitney, which I sent to you. To give a fitting reply to  
Max Muller and Whitney I wrote to many scholars including Cardona and  
Kiparsky. Cardona wrote to me that he would give a reply after two  
months. This shows that this is a difficult question. I did not get  
any reply from anybody else.  
 Now I found an answer. Both Max Muller and Whitney have gone  
wrong. Please find my answer along with the original criticism  
attached to this mail and send to me your remarks.  
  
E.V.N.Namboodiri.
