Shubha Akshaya - Truteeyaa  
of  
Nandana Samvatsara ( Lunar Calendar Year)  
The 26th Yugaadi Cycle starting on 23 Mar 2012  
( and ending on 10 Apr 2013 yielding to Vijaya Samvatsara)  
  
  

About Yugaadi:  
  
1. Yugaadi is made of two words from Samskrutham Yuga (= Paired together) + Aadi ( Commencement, Beginning). Thus Yugaadi means a reckoning point at which there was a pairing, a union in the Beginning for a Commencement of TIME CYCLE set in endless circular motion. Traditional schools set this beginning point as the start of the 'Brahma-Kalpa'- the onset of cosmic creation.  
  
2. Yugaadi - Wheels of Time (Samvatsara Chakra :Annual time cycles) 
within Major Cosmic Time wheels (- Kaala-Chakra) : Within this 'Brahma-Kalpa' smaller cycles are reckoned. The Chatur-yuga cycle ( four Yugas); Within this the Seven Manu 's cycles; Sub cycles within this ; the land-anchored human cycles linked to Royal patronages et al. The commencement of current 'Nandana' Yugaadi in the current Kaliyuga sub cycle, is on Gregorian calendar date 23 Mar 2012.  
  
3. Nandana -Yugaadi - is the 26th yugaadi in the smaller sub-cycle of
lunar calendar of sixty years cyclicity. The First of the 60 year cycle is called Prabhava (= Excellence of Commencement)  and the last 60th one is called 'Akshaya'(= The endless infinity). This cycle continues repetitively.  
  
4. Akshaya Truteeyaa of Nanadana Yugaadi ( and All Yugaadi's) -
Akshaya means Inexhaustible, Infinite, Perennial, Eternal. Truteeyaa means the 'Third'.  
  
  The third day of each Yugaadi commencement is considered most auspicious. Traders believe that investments (especially gold purchase !) made on this day will be growing very fast. Traditional Families do the worship of 'Gauri'- the goddess of auspiciousness.  
  
  
**May the Akshaya Truteeyaa of Nandana Yugaadi bring forth all auspiciousness to all of us.
