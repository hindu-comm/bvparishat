Dear Shri Dash and others

I saw nasa website. there is no such thing. Rick brigs did not offer posts to 1000 sanskrit pandits in india. neither pandits would have refused that opportunity. nor american scholars like sheldon would have been silent if that happened. instead sanskrit dept of harvard uni is closed and what remains in south asia dept.

  

there is no need to beiieve in press reports of sampadananda mishra and others who do not either speak truth or know it. sorry for harsh comments.

  

**sanskrit does not need this nasa for its greatness. we in india are here to study and protect it. no american children need to worry about it.**
