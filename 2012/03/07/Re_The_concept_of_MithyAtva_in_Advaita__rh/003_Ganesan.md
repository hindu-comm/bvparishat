Namste .  
Who were these **shaakta-s, tantrics, etc. etc.** that had challenged the Upanishads and were "smashed" by Samkara ???????  
What is the historical evidence for this ???  
It is the basic principle of debate that when one speaks about doctrines with logical arguments he should stick to that alone. It is not at all
'logical' or reasonable to suddenly change grounds and start talking about 'unfounded and non-evidenced legends'.  
Follow either of them but do not mix both--logic and legend !!!  
Ganesan
