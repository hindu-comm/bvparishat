My discussion and objection are on this very idea of ii\~svara in the Advaita. So again citing the Bhaashya is no use.

When these persons raise objections against Advaita 'by putting such 'satyam' or 'mithya' questions', it is due to their frustration according to you; but when the same persons 'praise' Advaita for the innumerable 'stotra-s' ascribed to Samkara, you take them to be certificates of appreciation as said by you in your earlier response: "The 'RanganAThAShTakam' and 'VishNu ShaTpadI stotram' of Shankaracharya are favourites of Vishishtadvaitins too".  
and  
" Madhusudana's 'bhaktirasayanam' is appreciated by Madhwas too".  
  
ARDHAJARATIIYA NYAAYA fully followed by you !!!!!

Unless the actual 'position' and 'status' of Ishvara in Advaita is not defined or, when Ishvaratvam itself is held to be 'due to avidyaa', what sort of 'anugraha' he can bestow on the jiiva to create 'advaitavaasanaa' ???????  
  
You again and again cite such large pssages........ My argument is on these very ideas themselves,,,,No use in citing passages from BSB, etc., etc.  
I know them and have read. The crux of the problem is the same.  
I am raising these objections on the very ideas expressed there---the basic concepts in the light of such statements of Amalaananda and VidyaaraNya as cited by me above. Do you say that these statements and ideas expressed in these texts are not fully valid ? That they do not fully represent the view of Samkara ? If so, you accept that the later Advaita teachers have 'distorted' some way the main teachings ????

That means Brahma has avidyaa........... Does it not ???  
So, finally, can one conclude that, in order to negate the duality-infested phenomenal world and put it as 'mithyaa'( with whatever connotation), and to negate a separate individual self, the Advaita Vedaanta is prepared to have a brahma with its own avidyaa (svaavidyaa) !!!!!!!! Excellent !!!!  



Your devotion to Advaita Vedanta and esteem to Samkara NEED NOT and SHOULD NOT make you so much BLIND to reason and History (based on Inscriptions) !!!!!. Samkara had nowhere said one should BLINDLY accept what he says.  
What a travesty of truth you are saying: "Inscriptions are not hundred percent real. Any biased king or authority could get them inscribed and installed and 'create' history."  
By the same argument one can definitely say and even it has reasonably been proved that the stories found 'Samkaradigvijayam-s' are highly concocted and many men 'got them composed and inserted and HAD CREATED a Life-History of Samkara' to use your own statement.
