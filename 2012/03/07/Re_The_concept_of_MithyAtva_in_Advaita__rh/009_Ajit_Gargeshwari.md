Dear Krishnamurthy,  
  
One needs to have logical consistency, coherence and structure while writing. In each of your posts you are introducing new concepts , Technical words which are not consistent with your earlier post. In a thread one can discuss one concept or one thought at a time. I don't have to repeat here, how you have changed the topic of discussion in each of your reply. If you need a discussion please be relevant to the subject of the thread. If you have your own hypothesis, theories not supported in classical texts of Advaita please clearly say so and state reason clearly as to why your position is better.  
  
Advaita philosophy or any philosophy is structured and technical word when used will mean one and the same to all readers. If you are deviating from standard meaning attributed to a technical term please say so and give you reasons correctly.  
  

"Shankar had the historic necessity of smashing the devious theories of the Buddhists, the atheists, and shaktaas, the tantrics, etc.,etc., that had challenged the Upanishads and the Advaita; else he would have also simplified the simple Upanishads such that everyone might access that. "  
  

Please substantiate this statement as Shri Ganeshan has asked.  
  

"In other words, after the anubhava, even though the world continues to appear, hisknowledgethat it is only a **false appearance** stays steady.' That is what exactly I quoted from Shankara - दृश्यत्वं असत्यं and not वस्तुतः असत्यं ॥ Indeed no standard text \[other than recent \] on advaita can give a different meaning."  
  

Please let me know where Shankara has said so by quoting the relevant texts from his Bhashya on Bramha Sutra.  
  
Regards  
Ajit Gargeshwari
