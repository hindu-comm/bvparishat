Dear ShriKrishna Murthy,

  
  
"In other words, after the anubhava, even though the world continues to appear, hisknowledgethat it is only a **false appearance** stays steady."  
  
  

This is a self contradicting statement. in other words it is logically flawed.  
  
This is a disputed concept o Advaita. The question of relation between between Jiva, Atman and Brahman, I agree but what you say is not correct or you have not written accurately.  
  
  
दृश्यत्वं असत्यं naturally then वस्तुतः असत्यं should be true.  
  
Even by a million words fire is always hot. so there are always levels of truth. Shankara has tried to explain his philosophy from the perspective of three levels of truth.'Prathibhasika Sathya, Vyavaharika Sathya and Paramarthika Sathya.

What you said and what Mr. V. Subramanian is entirely different, You can see your own mails sent on this list. This is all I have to say Thank You  
  
Regards  
Ajit Gargeshwari
