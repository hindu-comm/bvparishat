Only he who is an outsider will pose objections/refutations and not an insider. If one applies the criterion set by you , then there cannot at all be any objection or discussion of a doctrine of a particular system. For example, only outsiders like an Advaita Vedanti or a Miimaamsaka can raise objections against some doctrines of Samkhya and elicit the answers from the Samkhya system. An Ishvarakrishna or a Kapila will not raise any objections against the views of Samkhya. Same applies to Buddhism or Jainism.  
Any sampradaaya should be inherently logically sound to answer the objections.  
The Advaita Vedanta teachers such as Madhusudanasarasvati were so open for discussion and were able to answer the objections raised by the opponents. Fortunately they were not like you shutting the opponent's mouth by this insider-outsider logic.

Do not quote this passage out of context. This is my answer to your earlier statemet which you are not citing. If you are really sincere cite your statement here over which the passage above is my answer.

Then how can you say "Ishwara is sarvajna and never subject to avidyA/samsara." ?

I never subscribe to cheap parochialism.  
All these discussions and arguments are purely on the doctrinal and academic level raised with a sincere interest in analysing the doctrines of Advaita Vedanta. Do not resort to such silly characterisations.  
My criticism is against your total overthroughing of inscriptional evidences as cheap and biased without any basis.  
I mention the inscriptional evidences in the context where you said in your previous mail that "religion, aastikyam, is alive today only because of the efforts of Shankara". There are hundreds of inscriptional evidences only for the other historical deeds of Saiva Matha-s such as Golaki, Aamardaka, etc. throughout the Bharatadesha who had diligently worked for tje propagation of Bhakti, aastikya, etc. as well as Saiva Devotion.  
And you seem to consign all these fundamental historical evidences as concocted by kings,,,,,,and others.  
You are not ready to accept these historical facts and evidences and are ready to brush them aside in such a cheap manner, but you fully believe that hundreds of stotra-s have been composed by Samkara for which one can not show any pece of evidence.  
  
One may not be an expert in the inscriptions or in any such thing; but that does not mean one can throw them as totally baseless.  
My criticism of you is only for this.  
As you say, beyond a certain limit all these are vyaavahaarika only and do not have a ny value. Fine hold on to this view firmly!!!  
We need not discuss any more about the Advaita concepts because all these have no value !!!  
Very nice way of escaping from opponent's criticism. !!!
