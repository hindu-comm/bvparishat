You are making a wrong comparison. The former is about the siddhAnta of Advaita and the latter is about the stotra sAhitya. Those who express their opposition to the former have no opposition to the latter because the latter has nothing debatable in it. Shankara Himself has refuted certain schools for their philosophy but accepted their practices of devotion. I cited the pAcharAtra school instance covered by the sutra 'utpattyasambhavAt'. परमतमप्रतिषिद्धं अनुमतम् भवति । So you are invoking the ardhajarateeya nyaya in the wrong place.

As I said that is the reason why one has to be in a sampradaya. For the outsider any amount of bhashya reading will not help unless he has the open mind to look into the way the bhashya is taught within the sampradaya.

Not at all. I do not see any conflict between the verse of Amalananda or Vidyaranya. They are perfectly in tune with the Shaankara bhaashya taatparya. Advaitins do not see any problem where you see only problems!! That is the problem. It is the inability of non-advaitins to see where the vyAvahArika applies and where it does not and how the pAramArthika applies - that results in their confusion. That is what is recognized by the top scholars of Advaita when they interact with non-advaitins.

This is again another phenomenal mistaken idea of non-advaitins. Their idea of Brahman is different from the Advaitin's idea of Brahman. Not knowing this, they think Brahman (Ishwara) is endowed with avidyA in Advaita. In Advaita, to inform you, Brahman and Ishwara are different.
Ishwara is sarvajna and never subject to avidyA/samsara.

Your using certain words in upper case fonts to express your anguish and anger is only laughable, to say the least. Your devotion to your own siddhaanta makes you take stands that marginalizes all other schools and show that only your school is the truest. I do not subscribe to such cheap parochialism. That is why I have never quoted anything from the Shankaravijayam to support my arguments. And that is why I pointed out that inscriptions, etc. need not be sacrosanct. For me, as for any serious Advaitin, all such stories have a value only to a limited extent, initially to beget faith in the system. Beyond a certain limit these stories/puranas, et al have only arthavAda value. In the face of pAramArthika Brahman all others have only vyavahArika value. But the other schools have to depend on their history to survive.
