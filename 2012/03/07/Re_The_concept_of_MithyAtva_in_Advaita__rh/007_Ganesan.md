This is exactly what I had said earlier in this thread. Various views like this are accepted by Advaita only to be discarded later as 'mithyA'. Does it not smack of Advaita Vedanta's a sort of 'condescending attitude' like the "तुष्यतु दुर्जनन्याय"? As says Amalaananda in his Bhaamatiikalpataru:  
  
निर्विशेषं परं ब्रह्म साक्षात्कर्तुमनीश्वराः ।  
ये मन्दास्तेऽनुकम्प्यन्ते सविशेषनिरूपणैः ।  
and the verse of Pa\~ncada\~sii:  
मायाख्यायाः कामधेनोर्वत्सौ जीवेश्वरावुभौ ।  
यथेच्छं पिबतां द्वैतं तत्त्वं त्वद्वैतमेव हि ।  
  
which have completely dumped all the saguNopaasanaa, Bhakti, muurtipuujaa, offering worship to various forms of God, etc., etc., under the realm of ignorance --avidyaa, as the practices of dull-heads--'manda-s'.......What is all this ??? If one were to sit up and think about such views and their implications in the realm of Bhakti, it will be realised how they promote no 'real' devotion or anything 'concrete' ultimately. May be a Samkara could have realised the nirguNa brahma but, for the majority, what will be the use of such 'doctrines' or for that matter for the propagation of the sampradaaya. Finally, all these 'high views' of nirvi\~e.satva, avidyaa kalpita, etc. are all given a go by and BhaagavatapurANa is resorted to.. !!!  
That may be the Advaita view; but, on that score or on the authority of the BhaagavatapurANa passages referred above, it is not correct to hold these views are incorrect or unacceptable.  
If these views of many tattva-s beginning from 2 onwards are just accepted onlyfor a final slaughter, then even 1000 tattva-s also can be accepted......... finally "smashed" as stemming from Avidyaa , maayaa, etc. I do not know how to characterise such an attitude !!!! and in what way it is useful in the positive sense--where the view 'what one holds is ultimately wrong' is lurking and staring at one's face !!!!  
Ganesan
