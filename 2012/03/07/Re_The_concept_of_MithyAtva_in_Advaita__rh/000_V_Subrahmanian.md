In the concluding part of the bhaShya on the 4th brahma sutra: तत्तु समन्वयात् - Shankara, quoting a few verses ( kArikA-s of one 'SundarapAnDya' as later commentators have identified) says:  
  

तस्मादहं ब्रह्मास्मीत्येतदवसाना एव सर्वे विषयः सर्वाणि चेतराणि प्रमाणानि ।

नह्यहेयानुपादेयाद्वैतात्मावगतौ निर्विषयाण्यप्रमातृकाणि च प्रमाणानि भवितुमर्हन्तीति ।

अपिचाहुः-

गौणमिथ्यात्मनोऽसत्त्वे पुत्रदेहादिबाधनात् ।

सद्ब्रह्मात्माहमित्येवं बोधे कार्यं कथं भवेत् । ।

अन्वेष्टव्यात्मविज्ञानात्प्राक्प्रमातृत्वमात्मनः ।

अन्विष्टः स्यात्प्रमातैव पाप्मदोषादिवर्जितः । ।

देहात्मप्रत्ययो यद्वत्प्रमाणत्वेन कल्पितः ।

लौकिकं तद्वदेवेदं प्रमाणं त्वाऽत्मनिश्चयात् \| \| इति । । ४ । ।

  

Here Shankara says that all the pramANa-prameya vyavahAra is valid only up to one's gaining the aprokShAnubhava of his BrahmasvarUpatva. Once this anubhava takes place the falsity, kalpitatva, of all phenomenon is quite clear to him. In other words, after the anubhava, even though the world continues to appear, his knowledge that it is only a false appearance stays steady.
