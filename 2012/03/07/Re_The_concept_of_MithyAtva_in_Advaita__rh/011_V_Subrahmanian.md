I thought you had already got the import of what I have been suggesting. Yet, to make it more understandable I shall present the facts. In Advaita shaastra one comes across not just the type of the above Amalananda's words but many more apparently 'shocking' realities like:  
  
न निरोधो न चोत्पत्तिः न बद्धो न च साधकः ।  
न मुमुक्षुः न वै मुक्त इत्येषा परमार्थता ॥  2.32 \[Mandukya kArikA\] and also in an upanishad.  
  
32 There is neither dissolution nor creation, none in bondage and none practicing disciplines. There is none seeking Liberation and none liberated. This is the absolute truth.  
  
And Shankaracharya declaring in the BSB 2.1.14 that the Veda is only vyAvahArika satya (and not pAramaarthika satya). See a full post on this topic:  
<http://www.advaita-vedanta.org/archives/advaita-l/2010-April/024262.html>  
  
When a student/sadhaka of Advaita Vedanta encounters the above kind of teachings he will not stop holding the Veda to be the pramANa for his quest. Nor will he cease to have/develop bhakti for the Devata-s of the Vedic tradition. Nor will he give up sadhana since 'there is no bondage and no liberation in the ultimate point of view'. He will, instead, conclude correctly that all these statements are from the Realized person's point of view and therefore the ultimate truth. For the one in the path to realization, these are only indicators of the Ultimate position, the attainment of which is, however, incumbent on one's following the bhaki/karma/jnana disciplines as taught by the Veda. This is akin to Lord Krishna teaching the Para Tattva of Atman in the Second Chapter to Arjuna yet enjoining upon him to be a karma yogi. One can see how even Arjuna had, upon hearing the Atma tattva being taught by the Lord, trying to seek escape routes from karma yoga but the Lord insisting again and again till the 18th chapter that it is karma yoga that is for Arjuna to follow, keeping in view the ultimate goal of jnana yoga.  
Thus in spite of quotations from Amalananda, etc. the guiding principle for the sadhaka is:  
  
(a shloka of the sarva vedanta siddhanta saara sangraha:)  
  

जन्मानेकशतै: सदादरयुजा भक्त्या समाराधितो

भक्तैर्वैदिकलक्षणेन विधिना सन्तुष्ट ईश: स्वयम् ।

साक्षात् श्रीगुरुरूपमेत्य कृपया दृग्गोचरस्सन् प्रभु:

तत्त्वं साधु विशोध्य तारयति तान् संसारदु:खार्णवात् ॥ (225)



\[The Lord, being pleased with the constant and unflinching devotion and worship in the prescribed manner, extending over many lives on the part of the seeker, manifests Himself, in His infinite mercy in the human form of the Guru, thereby becoming accessible to the shishya for shushrUshA and vichara which culminate in his crossing over the perilous ocean of samsara.\]     
  
This will be his attitude, despite the Amalananda's statement, of the sadhaka. He will understand that he is a mandAdhikAri who has to go through the Vedic injunction faithfully to uplift himself to the higher levels. There is no insincerity or make-belief in this. For, he also knows that such things will not earn Ishwara prasada.

The maxim: अध्यारोपापवादाभ्यां निष्प्रपञ्चं प्रपञ्यते as quoted by Shankara as the words of 'sampradAyavits' in the Gita bhashya and also by Gaudapada in the kArikA while teaching in the kArikA 3.15:  
मृल्लोहविस्फुलिङ्गाद्यैः सृष्टिर्या चोदिताऽन्यथा ।  
उपायः सोऽवताराय नास्ति भेदः कथञ्चन ॥  
//The scriptural statements regarding the creation, using the examples of earth, iron and sparks, etc. is merely by way of generating the idea of oneness; multiplicity does not really exist in any manner.//  
  
the concepts of creation, Ishwara as the Creator, etc. are all an adhyAropa done by the shAstram (Veda) with the purpose of teaching the most subtly Advaita Satyam to the aspirants. Since most people are turned towards the created world, enamoured by its attractions, the Shruti, as an upAya, posits a Creator, Ishwara, to turn the aspirants' attention from the creation to the Creator. Once this is accomplished it goes further to show that the Creator Consciousness is no different from the aspirant-Consciousness. This is the accepted prakriyA of AdvaitavAda which is perfectly brought out by Amalananda. If you have read the BSB carefully you would have realized that the saguNa rUpam of Brahman is not considered real:  
  
This statement of Shankara in the BSB 2.1.14 is the key to understanding the status of 'Ishwar' in Advaita:  
  

*तदेवमविद्यात्मकोपाधिपरिच्छेदापेक्षमेवेश्वरस्येश्वरत्वं सर्वज्ञत्वं सर्वशक्तित्वं च न परमार्थतो विद्यायापास्तसर्वोपाधिस्वरूप आत्मनीशित्रीशितव्यसर्वज्ञत्वादिव्यवहार उपपद्यते ।*

  

//Thus, only in the realm of the ignorance-created upAdhis are Ishwara's Lordship, Omniscience and Omnipotence, and not in the pAramArthika realm which implies that the ignorance-created upAdhis have been negated/dispelled by True knowledge. In this post-negation scenario the ignorance-realm of Ishwara-Ishitavya (ruler-ruled) duality and omniscience, etc. do not have a place.//

  

This is perhaps the best and most unambiguous statement that one can keep etched in one's intellect with regard to the status of Ishwara in Advaita.

  

These following sentences, again from the above BSB, are added notes on the topic, the translation of which can be obtained from Swami Gambhirananda's book:

Thus you can see there is no basis in Advaita Vedanta to the wrong thinking that 'saguna brahman is only kalpita by jiva'.

Many think that they can 'corner' Advaitins by putting such 'satyam' or 'mithya' questions. That only shows their frustration in not being able to come up with real objections against Advaita. I have answered this at the beginning of this post itself: Even though a sadhaka knows that ultimately it is mithyA, yet for his reaching the ultimate state he has to practice them. He knows 'IshwarAnugrahAdeva pumsAm advaita vAsanA.'
And for that Veda, though only vyAvahArika satya, has to be resorted.

It is the 'buddhipUrvaka kalpanaa' of the Advaita Jnani involved in this pUjA. It is like the father willfully playing 'thiruDan-police' with the child and deriving great joy out of it.

You are mistaken on this, too. If you read Shankara's commentary on Br.Up.1.4.10 where the 'aham brahma asmi' occurs you will see the essence of it is:  
  
ब्रह्मैव स्वाविद्यया संसरति इव, स्वविद्यया मुच्यत इव \[Brahman alone, owing to ignorance of Its true nature appears to be in samsara and upon acquiring knowledge of Its true nature appears to have attained liberation.\] This seminal Advaitic thought is what is brought out in that Madhusudana verse. There is no borrowing of this thought from any other system; it is clearly enshrined in the Upanishadic method. If the other texts have this thought, then it is only by the influence of the Upanishads.

I have answered this already in the beginning of this post. Just like karma/bhakti yogas, though essential, in the attainment of the naiShkarmya Advaitic knowledge. When one attains that knowledge he will realize himself as the Atman that is akartA-abhoktA, not just now, but for ever, in the past too. For, being with the body is not one's true nature; it is only adhyastha/aaropita/kalpita. It is with this dehAbhimAna one is a kartA/bhoktaa/samsaari. The shAstra wants to remove this abhimAna and asks him to engage in IshwarArpita karma/bhakti. Once he does this faithfully and reaches the level of realization of his akartRtva-abhoktRtva sharIravilakShaNa Atma status, he will know that all the karma that was done before was not by the Atman but by a pseudo 'him'. This is the teaching of the Bh.Gita. So, your charge is without any basis and is only directed at the Vedic method.

Since it is only the mithyAtma (dehAtma) that does karma and engages in bhakti, etc. and since the mukhyAtman alone is satya, the scripture gives a certain vyaavahArika status to karma/bhakti, etc.

History is 'fact' only if it is favouring a particular party :-)
Historians are not superhumans committed to satyam. They have their own biases and failings. Inscriptions are not hundred percent real. Any biased king or authority could get them inscribed and installed and 'create' history. There have been cases where deities in established temples have been changed and a new history given to the temples.

Shankara has refuted those who based their systems on tarka to establish Ishwara, mUla kAraNam, etc. His agenda was to establish the ultimate praamANya of the Vedanta which Badarayana aphorized in the sutras. So, all those schools that were opposed to the Vedanta were taken up for refutation. So, the argument of 'incorrect understanding' cannot be raised against Shankara. If one reads Shankara's commentaries one will find most of the objections that the later Acharyas raised against Advaita are already raised by Him and replied.
