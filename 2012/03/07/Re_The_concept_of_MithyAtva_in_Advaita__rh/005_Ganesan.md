Namaste  
I have already read Samkarabhashya-s on the prasthaanatrya in the  
ORIGINALS as well as some sub commentaries.  
That is why I am writing my comments on your INTERPRETATION of Samkara.  
Now, why shoud one read PV Kane's History of Dharmasastra to know  
whether Samkara had "smashed" the tantric-s and shaakta-s or not ?  
What is the LOGICAL RELATION between these two types of texts ????  
If you really want to be reasonable show some "internal evidence" on  
this point from Samkara's texts. I believe you understand what I mean.  
Thanks  
Ganesan
