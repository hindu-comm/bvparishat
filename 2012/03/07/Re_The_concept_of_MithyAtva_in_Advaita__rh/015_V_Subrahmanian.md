The above is a misunderstanding that you are exhibiting here. It is not that sarvajnatva, etc. are creating samsara for Ishwara. Ishwara in Advaita is the one who dispels samsara of the jiva-s by removing their ignorance. What the above statement of Shankara says is: It is owing to the upAdhi-s that are avidyAtmaka, ataattvika, kAlpanika, that divisions are created within the divisionless Brahman and we have distinctions like Ishwara, omniscience, omnipotence, the ruled jiva-s who are ignorant, etc. Nowhere does the statement suggest that Ishwara is in samsara/ignorance.  
  
One may read this article which is exactly on the above topic:

Question: Ishwara belonging to realm of Maya and Ishwara being deluded is one and the same isnt it? Only deluded (unliberated) folks are in the realm of Maya isnt it?  
  
  
Reply: Not at all. Supposing there is a Commissionerate of Prisons headed by an IAS officer. For logistical reasons his office is located inside a sprawling Central Prison premises. When he is in his office, a relative calls up his house and enquires where this officer is. His wife answers: He is in the prison.   
  
Supposing there is a criminal in the prison serving a five-year term.
HIs relative, not in contact with this criminal/prisoner's family for a long time calls up his house and asks where this man is. His wife answers: He is in the prison.  
  
Now, both the answers are facts. Yet they have a world of difference between them. Similar is the case with Ishwara and the bound jivas coexisting in the realm of Maya.

I close the discussion with a note of agreement with you showing how and when concepts become of no value:  
अविज्ञाते परे तत्त्वे शास्त्राधीतिस्तु निष्फला ।  
*विज्ञातेऽपि परे तत्त्वे शास्त्राधीतिस्तु निष्फला* ॥ (VivekachUDAmaNiH - 61)  
  
शुभमस्तु ।
