My dear Hemant,



I would like to draw your attention to the fact that Indra was grafted wih the testicles of a ram; because he lost his own testicles due to the curse of Gautama, for molesting his wife Ahalya. Besides, an Ikshwaku King Alarka donated his own eyes to a blind Brahmin, who begged for his eyes.



You may see Valmiki Ramayana 1-49-8 and 2-12-43.



yours fraternally,

s.r.krishna murthy.
