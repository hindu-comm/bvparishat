--- However, this information is so scattered and inextricable from the environment that the physical probability is essentially zero that it could provide a continuity of identity from one body to the next.

  

It is simpler to havea scrambled egg to be unscrambled than for identity to carry forward (i.e., this person was Arjuna, this next person was Arjuna reincarnated).

  

An underlying assumption here is that 'Arjunatva' carries forward with reincarnation. This is wrong.

  

The 'continuity of identity' that is being deliberated is completely fallacious because the identity being talked about is generated only in the tandem state of atma and sthoola shareera.

  

If it were to then be said that reincarnation is indeed not plausible because 'Arjuna' is not reincarnated, there is one postulate that accounts for it quite clearly, which is thatthe same entity that is now espoused with Arjunatva was previously espoused with many such identities, like vrukshatva, keetatva, mrugatva, etc.

  

That entity is a unit of information, which for its attributepossesses'awareness' or gnyaana, which expands or contracts depending on the tandem state it has adopted for itself in a particular birth.

  

Regards,

  

Aditya.
