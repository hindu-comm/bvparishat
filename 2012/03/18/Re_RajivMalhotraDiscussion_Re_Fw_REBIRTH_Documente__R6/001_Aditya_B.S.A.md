"As a Hindu I accept the freedom of everyone to believe in whatever they choose to believe."

  

Mr. Rajaram, with due respect to your acceptance of this freedom, it is quite immaterial to the fact that people are going to believe what they choose believe.

  

"Further, I don't think karma needs reincarnation to work."

  

As for the Vedantic perspective--it is positivist, not argumentative, and hence certain precepts are not open to free flowing personal interpretations.One of them is reincarnation.I do not mean that these precepts are not open to reflection, but if one claims to be a follower of Vedanta, certain precepts (like this one) are common to all the various schools that come under its fold, and are accepted as is, from the strength of shaabda pramana. I do understand, of course, that the mix and match attitude of a free-wheeling academic would probably castigate doctrine as 'dogma,' and adopt an approach that would seek to reconcile different doctrines in favor of an understanding that serves one's intellect to the exclusion of everything else.

  

However, while this may seem superficially to be the refuge of rational behavior, on the contrary, it is most irrational in the context of interpreting Vedic/Vedantic precepts. A self-aware intellect might want to consider the fact that if it were not exposed to these pramanas, some of these concepts (like reincarnation in this case) might not have occurred to it at all, and hence the method of deduction that is used to break these concepts apart might be akin to the tale of the blind men and the elephant.

  

If that same intellect is then to respond to charges of intellectual cowardice or escapism, it might be most prudent to realize that discretion is often mistaken for cowardice in the bravest of men, and hence much leeway might be granted to those who make such charges, as stemming from ignorance of the larger picture.

  

Various statements from the Bhagavad Gita and the Upanishads confirm reincarnation unequivocally. A Hindu might believe whatever he wants to believe and accept the freedom of others to do the same, but that doesn't bear even an iota of relevance to the positivist assertions of the prasthana traya.

  

Let not the all-encompassing nature of Sanatana Dharma, which is borne by such esoteric precepts like apaurusheyatva, nityatva, etc., be mistaken for some flaccid flux of piecemeal ideas that caters to everyone's interest for meager intellectual gratification, like fast food catering to a salivating tongue.

  

Regards,  

  

Aditya.
