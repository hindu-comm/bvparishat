 If people want to believe in reincarnation and rebirth it their prerogative. As a Hindu I accept the freedom of everyone to believe in whatever they choose to believe. But why look to science to support it?



 It is the same with scientists. Some are religious some or not. The scientific method is rational. But that does not mean all scientists are rational in everything they do. Many can be highly irrational as anyone who has worked with scientists knows.
