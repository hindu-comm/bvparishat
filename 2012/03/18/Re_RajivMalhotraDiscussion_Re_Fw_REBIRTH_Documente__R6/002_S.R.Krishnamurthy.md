Dear scholars,



Dr. Arun says that as a physicist, he does not believe in reincarnation.

But as a student of physics, Idare say thatreincarnation is a scientific reality; because both according to science and philosophy, there is nothing as a total destruction but only a change of form. That is enunciated as a Law of conservation of total of Mass and Energy. So life also is a form of energy and it may escape from one frame; but has to find a form somewhere.



The upanishats vouch to this; and Shankara's Panchikarana also expounds the same. One form dissolves into another, and so nothing is lost or destroyed. The Science cannot give any other explanation than that. Just because some scientists are ignorant of the phenomenon or do not believe, they can not dismiss the Upanishadic explanation; unless and until they come out with alternative explanation.



This is emphasized in the Vedic hymn

Purnamidam purnamadaH purnat purnamudachyate\|

purnasya purnamadaaya purnamevavashishyate\|\|
