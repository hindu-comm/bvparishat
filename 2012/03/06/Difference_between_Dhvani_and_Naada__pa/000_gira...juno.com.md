Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



Difference between Naada and Dhvani

In the abstract book of 15^(th) World Sanskrit Conference (Jan 2012), there is one abstract with the title, “On Naada versus Dhvani in Bhartrihari’s View”.

It is said in the abstract , “ the term naada is used in the 5^(th) century CE by Bhartrihari and by its later commentators in the Trikandi to designate the sound form of the word as opposed or complementary to sphota or shabda. The author next states that the aim of the paper is to analyze whether Bhartri hari used or not naada as a perfect synonym for dhvani presumably in its praakrita dhvani form”.



I find the word “Naadaanupradaana” in Prof S. Korada’s book (Theories of Language-I like this book). I do not know meaning of that word. Perhaps Prof. S. Korada can enlighten us in this regard.



The word naada used in tantrika books is esoteric and difficult to understand in terms of the modern terminology of sound physics.



I guess there are scholars on this list familiar with Vaakyapadiya of Bhartrihari. If they contribute a little, that will help mein increasing my understanding. I assume dhvani means sound. Then what is meant by naada and how it is different from dhvani? Thanks. N. R. Joshi.
