Dear scholars,



My perception is Dhwani is any sound produced - intended or otherwise, articulate or otherwise; while naada is the note produced as designed - as by vocal chords or by instruments - hence is used in music or incantations. Indeed the English word 'Note' \[sic Music\] may be a corrupt form of Nada \[Sanskrit\]. I shall be glad to be contadicted.



Yours sincerely,

s.r.krishna murthy.
