Dear Sivasenani  
Thank you very much for the reply.  
All these confusion started for me because, I got a book Bhasavrtti by  
Purushottama deva, The vrtti is so lucid and self explainatory I am  
sure the vrttis are better than Sidhhanta Kaumudi and LSK both, before  
to that while studying LSK I even could not finish 5 sutras because of  
recurring doubts. I felt we no need to memorize the vrtti in  
Bhasavrtti.
