I don't think Bhattoji hasn't contributed anything to the study of Grammar which has been accepted by all the traditional grammarians after by him. But to evaluate his work as having done nothing to contribute simply shows one's ignorance of his contributions.

  

It is the same text all the commentators have commented and annotated by Bhattoji himself in his Shabdakaustubha. His contribution is not a creation of a book of his own out of nothing as you seem imagine by a novel book. It is his contributions to the theories of applications which you have to evaluate after yourself have mastered all the earlier commentaries earlier to him and all the contributions by him in Praudhamanorama and Shabdakaustubha and their commntaries and sub commentaries and not by simply casting a birds' view in these works.

  

Nageshabhatta WHO wrote commentaries on both Pradudhamanorama and also Mahabhashya is said to have studies 21 times the Mahabhashya before he noted his comments on Praudhamanorama in his Shabdaratna.

  

This is the information I gathered from my teachers of grammarand friendswho have mastered texts in both methods. It is a new thing to hear from you such a remark on a monumental work which explicitly declares that it is based on the opinions of Panini, the author of the Sutra-s, Vararuci the author of Vartika-s and Patanjali the great commentar of all times, Mahabhashya respected as the trio of Grammarians MunitraYA.

  

It is our homage to evaluate their contribution to the Paninian Grammar than merely dismissing them as works of plagiarism.
