I am not sure that the nomenclature - prakarana and prakriya - is usually followed. Anyhow, names are not important. The question is Kaumudi or Ashtadhyayi. No sane person would say studying Ashtadhyayi to know grammar is not the correct method. If - and only if - you find it difficult, then there is an easier book called vaiyaakaraNasiddhaantakaumudI (which is essentially a rearrangement of the Ashtadhyayi and the vaartikas. The difficulty in applying the Ashtadhyayi is supposed to be that one has to check for the applicability of all the nearly 4,000 sutras everytime one wants to decide a point of grammar. I guess this would be difficult only for the first few hundred times and then would become easier later. If one succeeds in mastering that, it is also supposed to be the big advantage that the Ashtadhyayi confers on the student, as compared to Kaumudi: the ability to 'hold' (dhaaraNa is the word in Sanskrit) the entire science in one's mind and apply it in real time, which is possible only well-trained, quick-witted persons. Apparently, for many, this kind of commitment of resources is too much and so they resort to the Kaumudi.

  

Typically this is the case with ParkaraNa granthas in other Sastras also. For instance, if one wants to study Advaita, Sankaracharya's bhashyas are no doubt the works to study, however it usually helps if one starts with a prakaraNa grantha like Vedantasaara. When one says, it helps, it is only to the madhyama- and adhama- adhikaris. For a uttama adhikari like Bellamkonda Ramaraya Kavi or Nagoji Bhatta the additional help might not be very much.

  

The situation with grammar is that the prakaraNa grantha - by that I refer to the Kaumudi - reproduces the entire mulagrantha as well and so, after one studies it, one finds no need to go back to the original sutras.  
  
So, finally, if one is capable of studying the Ashtadhyayi and has access to a competent teacher, that is a most beneficial course to action to take up. Otherwise, there is always the Kaumudi.
