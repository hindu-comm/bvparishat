Respected sir I have not studied siddhanta kaumudi.  
  
Indeed there are many places Bhattoji is inspired by mallinatha  
Raghuvam II 29( here refer sutra ti cha numbered 3037 instead of 3035)  
  
Kiratarjunee.. 17th Sarga last but one sloka(sorry I don't remember  
the sloka number but the example is "AjaGhne vishamavilocanasya  
vaksha:" if you did not find there I will search for you.)  
  
Raghu III 21 (but here tatwabhodinikara mentions mallinatha)  
  
Raghu II 33 ( here Bhattoji refers Mallinatha not by name but as  
sampradaayikaas)  
  
Raghuvamsa II 53  
  
Naishadha II 102(I don't remember exactly but the disputed word is  
"Avehi" with "Avihi" actually it is originally of Vamana's  
discussion(in Kavyalankarasutra Shabdasuddhi prakarana some where at  
the last part few pages to end it comes) here mallinatha mentions  
Vamana's name.  
  
here reference given is not all my findings though I have also found  
out on my own few(praphulla and Ajaghne etc)and which you may not find  
in the book Mallinatha - A study  
  
  
How I concluded that bhattoji is inspired by Mallinatha is for  
instance in Raghu II 29 a discussion of Praphulla is taken, the same  
sloka is taken in sidhhanta kaumudi for the discussion without  
mentioning Mallinatha's name but here the question may arise that what  
if Bhattoji also thought the same manner without looking into the  
mallinatha's commentary?? If that is the case why he could have not  
taken the sloka from Kumarasam.. 7thsarga 74 or Magha I 22. Also there  
are many examples like this.  
  
The book Mallinatha -A study is having around 200 pages out of 500  
which discuss about the grammer in mallinatha's commentary so all you  
have to do is the exercise of refering index to find more inspired  
places by bhattoji ( this book skipped so many discussion of  
mallinatha for example Praphulla etc.,)  
  
Here the discussion of Granthachowrya is irrelevant but I would say  
Mallinatha is just a wonderful person who helps you if you want to  
apply grammer after you learn it.  
  
The views here about granthachowrya etc which is really I am least  
bothered. All I need is to learn the subject. I found out all these  
not with the intention of granthachowrya but with the intention of  
learning .(the complete reason is so big which hardly matters here.)  
  
One more time I am saying I am really new to sanskrit. I am just a  
beginner and humble student.
