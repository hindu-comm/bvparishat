Dear all  
I respect your views. Respected, BVK Sastry, I never said any where  
Mallinatha's commentary is a tool to learn grammer. But for your kind  
information.  
  
The fact is Mallinatha's commentary is used as a tool, in Bhattoji  
Dikshita's Siddhanta Kaumudi any where the main discussions(I don't  
know about Proudhamanorama) done by him is originally of Mallinatha's.  
He just collected Mallinatha's disscussions without mentioning his  
name from Mahakavyas( in few cases he critisised Mallinatha without  
refering his name but addressing Praacheenaa:) So Mallinatha's  
commentary is almost a tool of application of grammer. I have done  
research comparing SK and Mallinatha's commentary on my own. 80% of  
the discussion in SK is of mallinatha's. I also refered a book A study  
on Mallinatha(according to me this book doesn't contain exhaustive  
information) printed Rastriya sanskrita vidyapeeta.  
  
Finally I would like to inform you from which book I read cons about  
Prakriya method.  
  
1.Siddhanta kaumudi pt Eswar chandra's edtion in two vols with hindi  
commentary ( Hindi is not my mother tongue my friend translated the  
cons for me) ( I respect his cons because he studied both method and  
also wrote commentary on both method books. Which is on Laghusiddhanta  
Kaumudi, Siddhanta Kaumudi and Kashikavrtti)  
  
2. Astadhyaaisutra paatha ed. by Pada-vaakya-pramaanjna Pt. Brhmadatta  
jignasu (who is the Guru of Yudhistira Mimamsaka.)  
  
So I request any one who studied both the methods can give sincere  
pros and cons rather giving adives.  
  
Regards
