Regarding Proudhamanorama's Khandana you can find this info in  
Dictonary of Grammer.  
a grammatical  
work written by a . grammarian  
named CakrapaQi of the Sesha family  
,of grammarians. The work is,meant  
, to refute. the arguments of BhCl-ttoji  
Dik\~ita in his PraUdhamanorama;  
  
  
( :2) a grammar work written by  
the famous poetacd. rhetoridan  
Jagannatha in. refutation' of th\~  
doctrines and explanations given in  
the P_rauQhamanorama by the  
stalwart Grammarian . Bhattoji  
Dik:;;ita. The work is not a scholar1y  
;one and it has got a tone of banter.  
,It was written by Jagannatha to  
show that he could also write works  
on Grammar and the bearded pedant Bhattoji should not be proud of his  
profound scholoraship in Grammer.
