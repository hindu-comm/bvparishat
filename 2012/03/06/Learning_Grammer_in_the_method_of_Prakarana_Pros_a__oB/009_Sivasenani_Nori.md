Dear Sir

  

It was not immediately clear from your earlier email that you had in fact studied the entire Siddhanta Kaumudi. In Telugu, we have a saying which roughly translates as "monkey-jumps in front of Hanuman'; my response would have been something of that sort. At an advanced level, scholars have indeed found faults with Bhattoji - but that is mostly with PrauDhamanorama than the Kaumudi itself.

  

I ask as a curious student. Could you give two or three references where Bhattoji's discussion is inspired from by Mallinatha's discussion and where he criticizes Mallinatha? Jagannatha Panditaraja wrote a khanDana of the prauDhamanoramaa- and he was, let us say, severe on Bhattoji. Till date I am given to believe that amongst the many things that Panditaraja had to say about Bhattoji, grantha-chouryam was not one. I thought he would not have missed it - and hence my curiosity.

  

Best regards

N. Siva Senani
