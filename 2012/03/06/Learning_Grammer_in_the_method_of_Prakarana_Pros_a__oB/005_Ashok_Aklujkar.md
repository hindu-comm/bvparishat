Shri Sharadatanaya,

From your most recent message it seems that you are not "very new to Skt language" but to Skt grammatical works. Therefore, pl ignore the following message that I sent earlier.

Vyakarana I came to know there are two methods. Prakarana(example  
Bhasavrtti, Kashikavrtti etc) and Prakriya methods(Laghu siddhanta  
kaumudi and Siddhantakaumudi etc).\<

Paa.nini's grammar, in either form and irrespective of the names employed for the two forms, is not meant for learning Skt as a language. If you are "very new" to Skt as you say, the best way will be to join classes that teach Skt through the medium of Skt. The next preferable alternative will be to use a \*good\* modern textbook that is appropriate to your age and prior linguistic background (including any Indian language that you may already know as your mother tongue / provincial language).
