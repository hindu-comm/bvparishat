Professor Aklujkar is right in his observation that Sharadatanaya is not a new altogether to Sanskrit Language, but to the history of Grammar Works AND the study of Grammar.  
  
The information he was given appears to be partially true and partially prejudiced by the supporters of both the methods. In fact, both have certain disadvantages and advantages, Following both will not be doing any good for learning Sanskrit Grammar for a beginner,  
  
Only introduction to Paninian Grammar is intended by Prakiya texts beginning  
from Rupavatara to be learned under a teacher organized topic with some advantages which are not present in Ashtadhyayi order and accordingly the scheme and object are different for both.  
  
Both are not meant for self study material as many appear to think by reading parts easily understandable. This is my opinion.
