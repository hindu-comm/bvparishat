Dear all,  
I am very new to this sanskrit language. When I was planning to study  
Vyakarana I came to know there are two methods. Prakarana(example  
Bhasavrtti, Kashikavrtti etc) and Prakriya methods(Laghu siddhanta  
kaumudi and Siddhantakaumudi etc).  
After doing small research I came to know there are people still who  
hates prakriya method till now and there are many disadvantages going  
according prakriyamethod. (The disadvantages were written in two  
books.)  
But there are no sincere pros and cons of both methods!!  
My humble request to clear my doubts  
  
I my self got these questions .  
  
1.From thousands of years every one studied Panini's grammer in  
Prakarna method then why now prakriya method hardly from 300 years.?  
  
2.If any one feels difficult directly going to Mahabhasya there are  
quite very lucid commentaries and elementary books like Bhasavrtti  
etc. (as we found Laghusiddhanta kaumudi in prakriya method) again why  
introduction of prakriy method??.  
  
3.Regarding making roopa. Was every one able to make roopa before the  
introduction of prakriya method?? if no the next question applies  
  
4.Earlier commentators like Mallinatha etc in their commentaries they  
easily make roopa without studying in the method of prakriya, then how  
this is possible?  
  
5. after reading cons of prakriya method in a book I felt, this  
prakriya method of study helps only for the one who doesn't wants to  
study the grammer completely or for the one who takes exams in  
Grammerin phatashala or univ having limited syllabus. is this true??
