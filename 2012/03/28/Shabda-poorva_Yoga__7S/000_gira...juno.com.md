Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



We had lengthy discussions on superiority of Advaita Siddhanta. This world is illusion and one should try to reach the real enlightenment of Brahman when illusion will disappear. There are many paths described in ancient India to achieve that goal. As'TAnga Yoga of Patanjali is one of them. Could scholars of this list throw some light on 'Shabda-pUrva Yoga please? What does one achieve with Shada-pUrva Yoga Suv-varga or Apa-varga and how? Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
