**Dear all,**

**I have come across this example in bahuvrIhi samAsa.**

**I found it very interesting because it was a combination between a तिङन्त and सुबन्त..**

**Usually the combination is between सुबन्त and सुबन्त.**

**Is it possible to derive this samAsa according to paninian system or is it apANinIya form ?**

**  
**

**The exact context is as below:**

**नाम नाम्नैकार्थ्ये समासो बहुलम्‌ । **

बहुलवचनात्क्वचिदनामाऽपि समस्यते । यथा भात्यर्को यस्मिन्‌ तद्‌भात्यर्कं नभः ॥ १
