I am forwarding to this List a message received intimating the uploading of a digital version of a book. This seems to be an own composition of the Author Sri Bellamkonda Rama raya kavi. It is in Telugu script. It would be beneficial to all Sanskrit knowers if someone takes up the converting of this Telugu version to Devanagari version.
