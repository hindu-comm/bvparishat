श्री:



\>\> Respected scholars: The Sankhayana Srauta Sutra describes Mahavrata and

\>\> the conduct of soma-savana.

\>\> It gives several details about the erection of a swing, ladies playing on a lute, singing and dancing.

\>\> Is there any book in English that explains the significance of these events? ThanksNarasimhachary  
  



Dear Sri Narasimhachary,



There is an interesting discussion on this topic in the Appendix of A.B. Keith's "The Sankhayana Aranyaka" :

[http://www.archive.org/details/TheSankhayanaAranyakaWithAnAppendixOnTheMahavrata](http://www.archive.org/details/TheSankhayanaAranyakaWithAnAppendixOnTheMahavrata)  



Further in the Chapter "Music and the Sama Tantra" of "The Form amd Function of Music in Ancient India Vol II" by Swami Pragynan-ananda

and available at RK Mutt, there is a very detailed discussion on your queries on the lute, samans, song, and dance in the Mahavrata.



Some points can be found in Pancavimsa Bramhana, by W. Caland

While no doubt useful, the commentaries of Western authors do have have their shortcomings in comparison with

traditional interpretations.

  

I recollect coming across some relevant references on these in the Latyayana Srauta Sutra, Drahyayana Srauta Sutra as well

but would have to look it up for details.



Sri Omprakash Pandey has also provided valuable information on his from the Tandya Mahabramhana,

Arsheya Kalpa in the Hindi text"सामवेदीय साहित्य,संस्कृतिए,कला और धर्म-दर्शन"

  
  

Hope this helps,





-Shreyas
