I admit that I should have mentioned Griffith. It has grown into a habit not to refer my students to Griffith, just because it is insufficient for research. I regretfully admit that the office habit should not have influenced dealings with equals. I am really sorry.

All said,one cannot fail to note that there is hardly any critical note given by Griffith and the translation is just approximate though lucid. In contrast Geldner, Ludwig, Renou or even Grassmann do not bypass difficult points.

What holds good for the Rgveda is equally valid for the AV when one compares Griffith with Whitney and Bloomfield.  

I do admit that Griffith made reading the RV and the AV a popular business. But Dr. Pandurangi means serious research.
