Dear Friend,

Wilson’s English translation is the earliest. It more or less follows Sāyaṇa with occasional deviation.

Grassmann’s German versified translation is literary with elements of his own style and imagination. It keeps the poetic spirit intact. Read with his Wörterbuch zum Ṛgveda it helps one to reach the Vedic poet’s mind. This has been the best attempt, besides Renou, according to me. It hardly takes note of the ritual background.

Ludwig’s translation is faithful but philologically critical. It is helpful in linguistic and other philological research.

The latest is from Geldner in three volumes from Harvard. This has copious notes and takes some note of the views of Sāyaṇa.

The last three will be useful only to those who read German.

The hymns to Maruts, Vāta, Vāyu and Rudra were translated into English by Maxmüller (*SBE* 32).

The Agni hymns In RV 1-5 were translated by Oldenberg (*SBE* 46) and those to the same deity in the rest of the RV by Velankar *JUB* XXIV.2 Sept 1955 and on; the Soma hymns up to RV 9.50 by S. S. Bhawe Oriental Institute Baroda 1957 & 1960.

All the hymns to Varuṇa, Uṣas and Soma were translated into French by Louis Renou in the *Études védiques et pāṇinéennes*. Excellent and full of valuable comments these are accessible only to those who know French.

Kunhan Raja translated only the so called philosophical hymns under the title *The Poet-philosophers of the Ṛgveda*.

Translations of selected hymns by Raghuvira, Macdonell etc. have limited use.

Best
