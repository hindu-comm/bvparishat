Dr. Pandurangi,



Though I have notsystematically studied Vedas, I have had to delve criticallyinto some Vedic Hymns

to ward off wrong interpretations; like brahmaa saraswatheem maithunaya jagraaha; or brahmaa vedaadhyanam chakre, etc.; during which I did refer to Griffith and Macdonnel among the Western scholars; who largely base their translations on Sayanabhashya. Sayanabhashya, though extensive, is not consistent in the standard or the content; which fact Dr. T.N.Dharmadhikari of Pune and a well-known Vedic scholar explains thus: Saayanaacharya was the chief editor of the Bhashya and wrote the prefaces to each Sukta; and a number of editors under him wrote the Bhashya to different hymns. That explains the deficiency in the Bhashya. I consider that a plausible explanation.



In case you are interested, I will forward a small compendium of researchon some of the Vedamantras; on which I have commented for your examination.



Yours fraternally,

s.r.krishna murthy.
