Sri Aurobindo's translation is very well-known. So are those of Coomaraswamy. But the first correspondent, Veeranarayana Pandurangi, had asked for faithful renderings. The translations of the twophilosophers mentioned were strongly coloured by their own ideology.  

I had inadvertently omitted K.C.Chatterji's Vedic Selections, CU,1954,57. These are more helpful and faithful than those in Macdonell's Vedic Reader (OUP). Chatterji's notes enable a beginner understand the difference between Western and Indian interpretations. The Appendices on Grammar, Padapaatha and accent are indispensable even for advanced students.
