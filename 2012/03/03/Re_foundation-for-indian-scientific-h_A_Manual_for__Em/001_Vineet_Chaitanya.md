The third name is Yasamusa Kanada who has been calculating pi to an ever-increasing number of decimal places with various colleagues for about 20 years - two million in 1981, eight million and then sixteen million in 1982, ten million in 1983, and so on until the present record of 1.24 trillion digits late in 2002. This last calculation required 400 hours of supercomputer time.
