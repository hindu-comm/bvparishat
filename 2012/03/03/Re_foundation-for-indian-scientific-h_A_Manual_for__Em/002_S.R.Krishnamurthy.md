My dear Hemant Kumar,



Your claim that you possess MSS is nothing beyond a volume of bark; unless you bring out the Knowledge inscribed thereon. I need not point to you, a great scholar, the Vedic injunction - ***svaadhyapravacaneca na pramaditavyam***. You need not transmit your knowledge to apaatras. But you must do so at least to as many Brahmins as possible.



Now since you claim to have the material, produce your supercomputer. If a hardware engineer would cooperate, I would have built a supercomputer. But it is a pity that in our country, there is very little appreciation of merit especially. Less said the better.

But since you are in possession of rare materials and knowledge; you must come out with your prototype of a super computer that our ancient rishies used. I understand that a scientist in Bangalore has obtained patent for producing electricity from reciting Purushasookta. I look forward to hear and see the supercomputer that you produce.



And that does not require decrying others' efforts. your work will do that. Let us have it early.



yours fraternally,

s.r.krishna murthy.
