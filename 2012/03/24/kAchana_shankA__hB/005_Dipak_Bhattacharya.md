Pāṇini did not clarify the terms. It is from later grammarians who followed the Pāṇinīyaśikṣā, supposedly composed by the Master himself, to explain the terms that we can guess the positions. As explained by Jñānendrasarasvatī in the Tattvabodhinī the difference between internal (*ābhyantara*) and exernal (*bāhya*) efforts lies in whether they occur before the production of the sound or not. Internal ones take place before the production while when the wind plays its part after the production one calls the effort external. This position is clear. The tongue touches the upper palate before the sound ṭ is produced. So the *spṣṭa* effort is pre-emission. But the effort made for inducing the *mahāprāṇa* character, say ṭh, is made after the production of the sparśa sound ṭ. Personally I believe that the external effort is made not after but along with the emission while the internal one like, say, touching (*sparśa*) is made before. This is apparent even without phonography. But phonography with video of the oral movement might confirm.
