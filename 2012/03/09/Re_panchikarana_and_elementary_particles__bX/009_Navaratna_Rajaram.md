 No one denies Vedic knowledge, but it not the same as the knowledge we have from modern science though there may be some overlap. The spin (rotation) around an orbit is not the same as what we call spin in quantum mechanics. It has no orbit but a quantum mechanical property that distinguishes between force and matter particles and their statistical behavior.



 We really should not confuse the two which are looking at the cosmos at totally different levels.



That is all I'll have to say on this topic.



Sincerely,

N.S. Rajaram
