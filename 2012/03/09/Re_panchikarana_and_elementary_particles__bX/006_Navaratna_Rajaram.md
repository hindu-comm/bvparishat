 Well put. We do injustice to both science and Vedanta by making unfounded claims. The result will be even valid claims are rejected because so many unsound ones have been made. It is crying wolf too many times.



 The terms 'spin up' and 'spin down' have very specific meaning in QM and are fundamental to metaphysical concepts explored in results like Bell's theorem. If someone were to give a Vedantic interpretation of entanglement and Bell't theorem, etc, they would be of interest. But these cannot be based on simplistic geometric ideas or word similarity.
