Dear Shri Krishnamurthy,

The conventional definition of the **spin quantum number** *s* is *s*=*n*/2, where *n* can be any non-negetive integer. Hence the allowed values of *s* are 0, 1/2, 1, 3/2, 2, etc. The value of *s* for an elementary particle depends only on the type of particle, and cannot be altered in any known way (in contrast to the *spin direction* described below). The spin angular momentum *S* of any physical system is quantised. The allowed values of *S* are:

![S = \\frac{h}{2\\pi} \\, \\sqrt{s (s+1)}=\\frac{h}{4\\pi} \\, \\sqrt{n(n+2)},](https://ci4.googleusercontent.com/proxy/iA5TBRdxaFN0eYHBgpYfUnTL5pT3BmptepGL5UiNDxnSF5lmrHpRr1Ssjbs5WqYqnYHnjFKJFK9Qfw-MKvOBDLt-bMGFW5wzbpCjNhK0CIJgHUWx3UjxdnzVyR09XVzhqujUd6VKjG4NRcM=s0-d-e1-ft#http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/math/a/3/d/a3dcfc1fafbf03f2a2934d98fc82533c.png)

where *h* is the Planck constant. In contrast, orbital angular momentum can only take on integer values of *s*, even values of *n*. That is why ![\\frac{h}{2\\pi} ](https://ci3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/mtlZ1_BRLs7ujjom2iiAylhREH2bNXSqdmefSGZLYRcb1cB_n-07Ioz3_qKBH_Zj2pf_x2bWJeJxmZyGGwqhwv9K0DRf2zRjrrjWSYOJD0Led_uV__Di8Yu6dIR_W0IsuWn12xNH7gwjQdM=s0-d-e1-ft#http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/math/7/b/6/7b6f399336fd72ea072364ca6304cff3.png) rather than ![\\frac{h}{4\\pi}](https://ci5.googleusercontent.com/proxy/weV44p0lb6flNnq8I8PH-6yg-sIYa5lNEu86ArbWXTzbyJf8SowwbrFU_RN6X_7qftfLAzopDsWehEqWjj-pWEfSvqy28s39d2OS5UUiBVkvxSljHHh4HGmLmMToPMqI2F661u8B_d4M7lw=s0-d-e1-ft#http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/math/c/e/c/cecbcbc1fa9565d839e05941e267649b.png) was defined as the quantum mechanical unit of angular momentum.  

  

Please let me know if any Vedic texts even remotely was close to the above definition. That is why I said don't read you unfounded pet theories in Vedas. If you talking about philosophy of science, Vedas and Indian philosophy have a lot to offer but what you are talking about or hinted in your writings and posts doesn't make any sense to me for you don't answer specific queries and if you have tried they are unstructured and vague.

I am a keen student of philosophy, metaphysics, epistemology especially Indian philosophy and Shankara Vedanta in particular. I have great pride in scientific advancements that Indians achieved in the field of mathematics, metallurgy, chemistry geometry etc. But please don't be confused with those advancements Indians achieved by trying to weave in unwanted theories into our Vedas.

Regards

Ajit Gargeshwari
