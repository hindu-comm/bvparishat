My dear Dr. Rajaram,



I did not say that sub-atomic particles are only five. All that I said that the Vedas declared that there were mainly five particles which constituted the atom. That Vedic knowledge cannot be denied.



Secondly, you claim  
" A fundamental role is played by the concept of spin, which too could not have been known in ancient times."



You are perfectly right as regards the first part about the role of **spin**; but I have to contradict you on the second part. The axis of the universe is called ratha in Rik.1-164-2; which Yaska clearly defines as **spin**.

not merely that, in Hymn 9 there itself, it is clearly stated the mother earth which fell into the orbit soon realised that in her **spinning** in the orbit liesher stability.



Yours fraternally,

s.r.krishna murthy.
