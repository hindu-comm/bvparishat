Dear shri Krishnamuthi,  

  
  
" A fundamental role is played by the concept of spin, which too could not have been known in ancient times."  
  

What you are talking is sheer nonsense.. Do you know any mathematics, do you understand Quantumn mechanics at all????  
All i can say say please don't display you ignorance about science again and again. Do you know what is the concept of spin and anti spin. are you replying because you need to reply. Please answer.  
Thanks  
Ajit Gargeshwari
