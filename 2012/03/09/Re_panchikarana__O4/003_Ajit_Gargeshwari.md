Krishna Murthy.  
Shankara defends his doctrine against the atomic theory of Vashehiks in his Brhma sutra Bhashya and refutes the doctrine of atomicity. Please read Brhma Sutra commentary. Pancheekarnam is ascribed to be written by sShankara. Scholars have disputed this work and it is not Shankar's work. One can refer to Paul Hackes and others researches on this subject.  
  
I am not confused. before saying so I request you to kindly desist from reading twentieth century scientific theory concepts in to Shankaracharya for he lived in seventh or eighth century AD.  
  
Vedas are self consistent and they don't required absorbed and misleading concepts of twenty century science that you propose to introduce. ( I am not saying twenth century science is not consistent it is highly sophisticated, advanced and consistent). If the vedic Rishis knew about twenth century science they would clearly sated so.
