Dear Rajaram,  
  
Law of Karma is a fundamental doctrine of Indian systems of religion. There is a mass literature on this subject one can find continuous and continued references to this doctrine right from vedic literature to literature of modern times. You can read PV kane's history of Dharmashastra Volume 5 part 2 for a synopsis.  
  
You can also read more Ican provide you a list of books on the subject if required.  
  
The law of karma does not depend on ones personal belief it is a fundamental law.  
  
You can also read Budhhist and Jain books on this subject.  
  
One cannot dismiss these ancient doctrines, without a proper and detailed studies.  
  
Science has it domain and limitation so does religion and beliefs .  
  
Regards  
Ajit Gargeshwari
