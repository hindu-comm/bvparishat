Very correctly said.

Karma and Reincarnation -- are the two of the fundamental doctrines of all the  
Darsana-s (except Caarvaaka) including Buddhisma and Jainism.  
One can not so easily brush them aside under the garb of Scientific attitude.  
If at all one believes in the scriptures of our Sanatana Dharma, nowhere it is  
said in them that 'one need not believe in these doctrines unless one is  
convinced'.

If that is so, then one need not believe in the existence of Atma or Brahma,  
which obviously cannot be demonstrated in the 'laboratory'or 'scientifically  
proved'.  
This type of views under the garb of scientific attitude borders on agnosticism  
and will lead only to that.
