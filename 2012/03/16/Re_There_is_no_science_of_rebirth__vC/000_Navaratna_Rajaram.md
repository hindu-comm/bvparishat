 Reincarnation and/or rebirth is a belief, not a scientifically established fact. It is not essential for a Hindu to believe in reincarnation-- or believe in anything that he or she is not convinced of.



 Believers in rebirth trot out the standard pseudo-scientific method of arguing from a few anectodes and offering them as 'proof'. This is what believers in other pseudo-sciences (like astrology) also do.



 Had their been any scientific evidence, scientists would have turned it into a major discipline or a sub-discipline of neuroscience or something else. It would be highly profitable. Even psychology, a bordeline science, if a science at all has not adopted the idea. Only parapsychologists on the fringes of psychology talk about it.
