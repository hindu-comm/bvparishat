Semantics of Sanskrit Shabdas is important topic in philosophy of Hindu religion.



Performance of Yajnya according to Vedas using mantras incorporated in Vedas produce fruits (ApUrva). When the performer of the Yajnya diesbefore getting fruits, then who gets the fruits of his action? In order to answer this puzzle existence of Aatman is postulated which brings next birth to enjoy fruits. The whole edifice of Hindu religion is based on Brahman and Aatman. These are very ancient Sanskrit words. How did they get their meanings is the very important topic. During all branches of philosophical discussions on Hindu religion, words and their meanings play the most important role (This is my favorite research topic) . Many important AachAryas have spent much timediscussing the relation between Sanskrit Shabdas and their meanings. We have very knowledgeable Sanskrit scholars on this list like Dr. D. Bhattacharya, Dr, S Korada, Dr. H.N.Bhat. They could explain etymology of the words Brahman and Aatman.



By the way, American mystic Edgar Caycee (a devote Catholic) has confirmed existence of Aatman (he calls it Entity) as well as reincarnation. Edgar Caycee Institute is on the Virginia Beach. His all readings in his lifetime were filed here. As usual American business mencorrupted him in the later part of his life.



The son of Pastor James Bishop Pike died in England (perhaps drugs, I do not know). Ber fore death he was communicating with his father something about Hindu Escape Column (Light at one end, darkness at the other end).



I myself do not have proof of reincarnation or Atman. What I read, I posted here. Please ignore it if no use to you. Thanks. N.R.Joshi.

 Reincarnation and/or rebirth is a belief, not a scientifically established fact. It is not essential for a Hindu to believe in reincarnation-- or believe in anything that he or she is not convinced of.



 Believers in rebirth trot out the standard pseudo-scientific method of arguing from a few anectodes and offering them as 'proof'. This is what believers in other pseudo-sciences (like astrology) also do.



 Had their been any scientific evidence, scientists would have turned it into a major discipline or a sub-discipline of neuroscience or something else. It would be highly profitable. Even psychology, a bordeline science, if a science at all has not adopted the idea. Only parapsychologists on the fringes of psychology talk about it.
