Namaste.  
Highlights are mine.  
It is NOT my website, but the website of those  
who have used my name to coordinate research!!

Subject: ATHIRATRAM CHEAP PUBLICITY? CROWD PULLING  
To: "Dr. S. Ramakrishna Sharma" \<[d.ramak...@gmail.com]()\>  
  
  
Sir,  
  
The following is a quote from your research site of Athiratram 2012.  
  
"TO FIND THE INNER PEACE  N GOOD HEALTH â€¦.. !!!  
     VISIT ATHIRATHRAM SPECTACULAR EVENT AT PRAVARGYAM TIME TO  
WITNESS HOW  THE FIRE BALL RISES TO 60 FEET HEIGHT AND GET  
BLESSED FROM AGNI DEVATHA. NEVER EVER BEFORE SUCH A SPECTACULAR  
EVENT IN YOUR LIFE TIME."  
  
Sir,  
Kindly note that this is not a magic show or Circus event to have a  
publicity like this.  
It is also not meant for inner peace or health alone.  
  
Firstly, they are saying it is civilization, in the opening note.  
  
I find it to be a crowd pulling event to popularise a few individuals  
interest, if not tell them to change these contentions.  
  
I wonder how the Nampoothiris are agreeing to such publicity .  
I would like to disociate with such people.  
  
Krushn
