Hence, in the light of a negative SMS received from the mobile no: 919420490728\[**Son of the Yaga rakshaka**\] whose owner has not disclosed the name; not responded to my request for the same,  
I sincerely inform you all that **with immediate effect I withdraw from the Spiritual and Scientific Research Wing of Athirathram Advisory Committee.  
**I have not booked my tickets to and from Bhadrachalam.  
I request all those who have responded to my mails and are willing to come to Bhadrachalam to note that **Dr.S.Ramakrishna Sharma IS NOT CONNECTED IN ANY CAPACITY with the above  
mentioned event.**  
Regards.  
  
Dr.S.Ramakrishna Sharma.
