In this URL one can find recordings of the Vivekachudamani classes (in Sanskrit):

These were recorded at the Purnaprajna Vidyapeetha, Bangalore, where the classes were conducted recently. On these days special lectures on the Darshana-s were also delivered by noted scholars, all in Sanskrit.
These too, are available in the above URL. All these are to be found in the above page at the latter half.  
  
When I had announced the above program some months ago, some members had expressed the desire to hear the talks. That desire stands now fulfilled.
