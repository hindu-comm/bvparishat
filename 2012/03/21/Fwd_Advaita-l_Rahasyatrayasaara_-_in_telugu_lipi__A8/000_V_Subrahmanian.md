PraNAms to all  
  
I am trying to find if Rahasyatrayasaara of Shree Vedanta Deshika available in Telugu lip. The original is in Tamil. My father has written several volumes of commentary on the text in Telugu, and we are trying to publish those. The printer needs to cross check the original to insure the accuracy of the written words.  
  
If anyone knows and point to the source, I would appreciate it letting me know by my private mail.  
  
Hari Om!
