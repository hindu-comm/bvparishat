Sir,  
  
According to Vedanta the very conception that one is an individual is due to ignorance. This basic ignorance that makes one think that he is a pramAtR (knower, seer, observer, experiencer, etc.) presupposes other products of ignorance like a pramANa, prameya and pramiti. These could be translated as means of knowing/knowledge, objects of knowledge and the knowledge itself that arises from such an operation of the pramANas by the pramAtR on the prameya. So the entire triad of knower-knowing-known/knowable is ignorance-based. The Vedanta wants to reduce this triad to the Pure Consciousness that alone is ever-existing and never changing: न हि द्रष्टुर्दृष्टेः विपरिलोपो विद्यते
\[Brihadaranyaka upanishad\]. And hence teaches that the individual's (jiva's) thinking that he is a knower, etc. is owing to a wrong identification with the prakRti. If this wrong identification is given up owing to viveka and knowing oneself to be the eternal Consciousness, he is freed from samsara.  
  
So, coming to the last part of your question, an individual thinking that there are many other individuals out there perceiving the moon, and the moon itself, are all products of ignorance.
