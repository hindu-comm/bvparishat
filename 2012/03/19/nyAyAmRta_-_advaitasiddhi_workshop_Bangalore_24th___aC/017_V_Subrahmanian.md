Let me assure you that you have surrendered common sense in order to pick holes in my comment. I made it based on facts. Advaita has been under continuous attack from the time of Ramanuja followed by Madhwa. I am only giving popular names; there might be others who have indulged in such attacks before and after these. But these two names stand out.
Yet, after a millennium, the kind of misconceptions prevailing and the questions asked about Advaita in meets reflects a dismal understanding on the part of the questioners. I am saying this out of my observation and not merely making accusations. Since your response to this comment of mine is again, typically, based on such misconception, and with that basis you go on to make an 'analysis', I do not find it worthwhile responding to them. I also find your observation about my usage of the term 'true mumukshu' too, stemming from such a misconception. You could not keep yourself from your natural enmity towards Advata/Advaitins even while reading a sentence and taking the correct import out of it, a clear case of intellect surrendering to emotion:  
  
//While for a true mumukshu the various finer details of the different schools within Advaita is not necessary, these very distinct and varied thoughts have come up in the wake of objections raised by other schools, as an explanation of the Advaitic position.or as alternative ways of explaining things. //  
  
Where, in the above sentence, do you find me saying that only Advaitins are true mumukShus?  
  
You may restrict such misconceived observations about Advaita/Advaitins to your vishishtadvaita school-specific mailing list and spare this forum from false propaganda.
