It will take several kalpa-s for non-advaitins to learn that in Advaita there are no 'two': brahman AND jiva. There is only one.

Why? It is another misconception that non-advaitins can never come out of. They think: if anyone gets realization and becomes a mukta, there will be no world for him and therefore no 'other' bound people and therefore no imparting of any knowledge is possible. This misconceived notion was exhibited by Swami Vidyamanya Tirtha of the Madhwa mutt of Bhandarkere. See for a detailed article on this:  
  
[http://adbhutam.wordpress.com/2009/07/20/an-advaitin%E2%80%99s-assessment-of-some-dvaita-remarks/](http://adbhutam.wordpress.com/2009/07/20/an-advaitin%E2%80%99s-assessment-of-some-dvaita-remarks/)  
  
Shankara, while establishing jIvanmukti, has stated that if this were not possible, there will be no way the mokSha shastra can be imparted to another. The cases of Uddalaka teaching Shvetaketu, Bhrugu being instructed by  

VaruNa of brahmavidyA and a host of cases from the Upanishads are proof of Aparoksha Jnanis imparting this vidya to others and enabling their moksha. The Yama-Nachiketas case of Kathopanishad is a standing proof of this.

All this confused thinking, brought out in the typical case in the above URL, has no place in Vedanta. Someone who wrote a criticism of the above article did that being in the same misconception. An Acharya who has realized the truth can happily teach it to others who have not realized it. That bandha and moksha are illusory in Vedanta does not obviate the need or one to take to sadhana and get the avidya dispelled. In order to comprehend these things it is essential that one studies Advaita from a competent teacher, with a view to understand, and not to criticize.
For a critic is ever in ignorance about the methods of Advaita.

Again, a few email exchanges cannot possibly clear the grey areas about Vedanta or Advaita to be specific, to a learner. In Advaita, svarUpa jnanam is there for everyone. It is the mind that is in need of this jnanam for it is the mind that is in samsara. 'Knowable' is not an invention of Advaita with regard to Brahman: the Mandukyopanishad seventh mantra teaches the Brahman (turiya) as 'vijneyaH'. The Bh.Gita 13th chapter calls it 'jneyam' ज्ञेयं यत्तत् प्रवक्ष्यामि...The Lord has at the beginning of the Chapter taught: kShetrajnam chApi mAm viddhi.
So, Brahman is what has to be known. But not as an object but to be realized as one's own self. One's self can never become an object to oneself. It is only the ignorance that prevents one from realizing one's self in its true svarUpa that needs to be removed. That process alone is called by courtesy: knowing Brahman. Thus, clearly, the 'knowable' Brahman is known by the knower the mind.  It is the Upanishad that teaches 'विज्ञातारम् अरे केन विजानीयात्’ ’न तत्र वाग्गच्छति नो मनो..’ ’अदृष्टो द्रष्टा..’ also teaches 'आत्मा वा अरे द्रष्टव्यः, श्रोतव्यो मन्तव्यो निदिध्यासितव्यः..’ ’सा आत्मा स विज्ञेयः’. Unless one is really involved one cannot get over these apparently contradictory statements of the Upanishad. And so with Advaita.

No need of any such effort on my part. You can pretend to be whatever you want. Vedanta is least affected.

Not necessary. MithyA is something that appears to exist but does not in truth. When it is deliberately brought up to serve a purpose, as in the present case, it remains in its notional form and once the purpose is served given up.

One example of buddhi-pUrvaka-arOpa is 'vishNu buddhi in the sAligrAma'. In every kalpa pUja there is an AvAhanam of the devatA in the murti that has been purchased from the market. The invoking of/ infusing of the devatA in the mUrti is nothing but buddhi-pUrvaka-arOpa. One knows that it is a mere idol of clay or metal. Yet one superimposes on /in it the devataa idea and goes about the worship. When the time for visarjana comes, the devatA is formally given a send off and the idol is duly disposed. A fine case of 'adhyAropa-apavAda' in everyone's experience.  
  
On your comment on 'interpreting Vedanta' pl. read this:  
  
The dvaita scholar Prof. BNK Sharma writes in the History of Dvaita Vedanta and its Literature,  
  
\<quote>  
  
"Indian commentators pledged to the belief in the infallibility of the scriptures, have naturally assumed that the Upanishads have but one system to propound, one doctrine to teach. On this assumption, they have proceeded to unify the divergent and often hopelessly irreconcilable utterances of the Upanishads into a single system. The advaita of Shankara, the Vishishtadvaita of Ramanuja, and the Dvaita  
of Madhva are all the outcome of such attempts... Each one takes his stand on texts which appear to him to represent the highest truth, and these he tries to harmonise with those less favorable to his position and explain away the rest which go against his views. In adopting such a procedure, the Indian commentators have shown themselves to be  
makers of mokSha-shAstra rather than strict historical interpreters of Indian philosophy."

You can see how many 'masters' of the trade are there to give company to each other.

None of these happens to me. Let me assure you. I am not holding
buddhi-pUrvaka-arOpa' to be 'bhrama' as I have clarified. The same 'thing' is viewed from two standpoints in two different ways. Pl. understand that and you will be straightforward in your comments.

Again wrong conclusions. The mother adopts the trick with full knowledge of its nature. And discards it when she knows it is no longer needed; cannot be applied any longer; the child has outgrown the need for it. This is the apavAda that comes after the deliberate adhyAropa initially.
