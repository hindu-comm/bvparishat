Are we now entering into a debate between Buddhist Nihilism versus AdvaitaVada please let me know. I would like to participate. Please don't be confused between Sutra Bhashyas of Shankara and Bhaja Govidam I doubt whether it is Shankara' s work. There is no infinite regression in Advaita Vedanta if properly understood.  
  
Are you worried if Shankara lived for 32 years or or are interested to know his philosophy?  
Please read Shankras work in original or in translations and quote from his works where he he has hinted to what you say.  
You can remain a Buddhist or or a non believer but please display relevant philosophy not superficial thoughts  
  

I definitely accept सर्वं खल्विदंब्रह्म.  

If you accept this proposition then the world is naturally false? One cannot have two truths. When Bramhan is Satya naturally the world is Mithya.  
  
When one speaks about the world it only at vyavahra level its is not Parmarthika. For there is question of dispute at the absolute level. Ignorance is for the poser of question about ignorance it is not for Bramhan. Bramhan is complete by itself. It neither requires affirmation or negation.
