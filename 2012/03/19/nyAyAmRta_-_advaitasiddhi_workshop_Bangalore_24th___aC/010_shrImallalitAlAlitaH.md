People speak as if they are more unbiased and more devoted to veda-s than bhagavatpAda.  
If bhagavatpAda was not trying to tell the correct meaning of veda-s and upaniShad-s, but to collect people; then who will believe that rAmAnuja or madhva was not doing the same. Stories are spread everywhere that all did the same, i.e. collecting people.

Why do you hate this shUnyavAda ?  
Because, it's not in veda-s.  
You are also not in veda-s, so do you hate yourself. ;)  
Because, it is opposed to pratyaxa ?  
viShNu is also not seen by pratyaxa. So, theory of dvaitin-s is also opposed to that.  
  
Again, you can't compare shUnyavAda with advaitavAda.  
Why ?  
Because एकमेवाद्वितीयम् is enough to give advaitavAda a ground in shruti.  
Moreover, those who say that 'nothing is true' are not advaitins who say that 'only one is'.  
I don't think that it is a subtle difference. So, it doesn't need some special skill to understand.

Quote the exact place with exact words from advaita works.

Try to point errors clearly. pratiGYA is not enough for that.

brahma is sAvayava or niravayava ?  
If first, then your views are correct and then he will be vikArI, which is opposed to shruti.  
If second, then world can't enter brahma as a part.  
How could a sane person say a vikArI thing non-different from an avikArI thing ?

Singing bhaja-govindam doesn't need change in philosophy.  
  
  
Moreover, it will be better for all to concentrate on theories to understand, examine and refute; and not on persons. Please refrain from using words which provoke others. And to be precise don't leave pratiGYA alone, send hetu along with her.
