नमोनमः



Sri. Subrahmanian, couldn't resist replying again. I should definitely want to postpone my silence on the matter a little while longer.



I do earnestly appreciate your knowledge and your rebuttals of all my points.



You see, I don't hate shunyavaada, like someone else pointed out. I'm not out to defame it either. I would gladly recognize its superiority, if its superiority were not an illusion.



What is apparent, however, is that more and more contradictions crop up the longer you speak, which is the hallmark of every Advaita discourse. You say:



Pl. get your Vedanta knowledge correct: only jIvatvam is an illusion and not the svarUpa.   


Then you say:



Here is where the jahadajahallakShaNA operates and the jIva's true self is salvaged by discarding the unreal accretions.  



So there is a true self for the jiva, and that true self is not jivatvam (which is unreal).



Now, the true self for the jiva, according to you, is Brahma. Brahma is real, and the jiva is real. Yet they are both one.



So tell me, in the case that any of the Advaita masters attained mukti, jivan mukti, or anything, does that not pose the rather difficult situation of mukti being impossible for any of you?



If you come up with an ingenious rebuttal of that, you have to account for the fact that that great master knew that you were an illusion; and he, the jiva, was Brahma---and if you consider he attained mukti, and you still consider yourself as a candidate for mukti, then you, the illusion in his perspective, should now inevitably assume his mukti to be illusory in order to bring about your own?



Sri. Subrahmanian, I eagerly await your erudite response.



Now, you quote none other than Shankara as saying,



'...and to realize that Brahman, the Knowable...'



But in your blog, you say,



SvarUpa jnAnam, Brahman, Consciousness, does not fall under this category. For It is not ‘experienced’ as an object; It is the very subject...

  

Putting the two together, the 'knowable' is according to you the 'knower.' So Brahman is endowed with knowableness as an attribute to be known by the knower. But hold on, that would make it an object and a subject, which it cannot be, for it cannot be the object, according to yourself.

  

Bring out your magic wand, wave some anirvachaneeya and adhyaasa and some such, and make your point. I'll pretend to be amused.

  

About latitude and longitude, you say,

  

> 
> > 
> > They do not exist on the physical plane. 
> >

So their non-existence is dependent on a context. It's not that they don't exist at all. Your मिथ्या will have one believe in earnest that they don't exist at all.

  

The dictionary definitions of fiction don't tell me something I don't know already. However, this does:

I'm not surprised that you make this differentiation. You're masters of buddhi-pUrvaka-arOpa, which you do all the time while interpreting Vedanta.

  

Here is another example of your (for lack of a better word) crookedness:

  

a. You recognize unreal as 'bhrama.'

  

b. You recognize fiction as 'buddhi-pUrvaka-arOpa.'

  

c. If you hold 'buddhi-pUrvaka-arOpa' to be 'bhrama'---

  

then you are faced with the inevitable consequence of having to admit that your arOpa is real. For, if you are making an unreal fiction, you are stating a fact. For you, because of your contradictions, the Gumma exists. Terrible.

  

d. If you hold 'buddhi-pUrvaka-arOpa' to not be 'bhrama'---

  

---then your arOpa is a very real fiction. It is not what you consider मिथ्या. The characters of novels are works of fiction. They are not what you consider मिथ्या.

  

Either way, you're stuck, Sri Subrahmanian. Please stop listening for frustration in my words, and start listening for fact.

  

You keep reiterating that other schools have been trying to poke holes in your philosophy for ages and have not succeeded. You seem to be under another illusion, not surprisingly, for you make it a habit. Sri Subrahmanian, some schools of philosophy are gracious enough to accept that whatever might be your philosophical standpoint, your relationship with Brahman cannot be brought under a scanner for the world to see, and therefore, you might be a greater candidate for mukti than me. I have no problem accepting this. As a follower of Vedanta, I would be wrong to assume anything else.

There is a reason that I said silence will be the greatest criticism, Sri Subramanian. This is exactly it. Everything said by anybody who does not embrace Advaita appears to be flawed to you.

  

The efforts made to discuss are made with an earnest attitude to discuss something on a common platform with someone who is not completely deluded. The silence that follows the efforts serves to give you time for reflection, as it does for me, as well.

  

But in your case, it's a wishful thought, for you hold reflection to be unreal.

  

Regards,

  

Aditya.
