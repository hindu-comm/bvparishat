नमोनमः



This will be my last reply in this thread, because I don't see the point of sustainedargumentwith people who consider themselves illusions. Call it the easy way out. Call it my incapability.It definitely is, and thank heavens for it.



In every pramana that Advaita regards to support its position, the philosophy assumes जहल्लक्षणा for Brahma.But those who study the prasthana traya in its entirety know without doubt that it isअजहल्लक्षणा.



I'm sure I'mnowhere as qualified asSri Subrahmanian and others are to enter into scholarly discussion regarding Advaita. However, I am more qualified than any of them can ever claim to be in asserting the reality of anything (including brahma), because they are, after all, not real. (Before you jump at my flippancy, do read on, Mr. Illusion.)



Regarding fiction and reality,saying an "illusionis unreal because it is caused by ignorance, and ignorance itself is unreal because it no longer remains when knowledge dawns" means that my knowledge of the illusive will make it disappear. If so, the mirage of water should disappear because I know it is illusive.

  

But the Advaiti is prompt with the reply of बाधितानुवृत्ति and so on and so forth. He is never disillusioned.

  
Things are said again and again to prop up the illusion, till it becomes delusion.

  
"Latitudes and longitudes are imaginary" ---but that imagination is real, and those lines are not invisible in the Atlas book. They exist.

  

Sri Subrahmanian, the locus of the real attributes, namely the Gumma, is fictional, but cannot be unreal. 

  
As long as the fiction is not realized, it is real. When the fiction is realized, it does not become unreal, it just becomes fictional.

  
Fictional does not mean unreal. This throws further light upon the biggest fallacy of Advaita.

  
Just like in the regular course of life no one argues with delusional people, so in the world of Vedanta. An attempt is made, and then the inevitable is accepted. The greatness of Advaita is realized, just like a delusional person must always be pacified by one who is not.



Even if I accept in entirety that all my posts are due to "deep ignorance," etc, that's infinitely better than all of your posts that claim to assert something, which even in their success of assertion, establish nothing.



I appreciate your interest in the matter, your hearty rebuttals of my posts, and your vehement assertions of Advaita.



The humor of the whole situation lies in the fact that my impending silence on the matter will be Advaita's greatest criticism.



For silence, as a reaction to arguments asserting illusion, just like silence in reaction to a mirage, is the reasonable response, as opposed to running towards the mirage for water.



Whatever little was said, was said in the hope that the mirage was comprehended as a reality.



And with this, I sign off, being my ignorant but real self, with a request for pardon from anyone I might have offended.

  

Regards,



Aditya.
