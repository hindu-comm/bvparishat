The Brihadaranyaka Upanishad teaches the realization as 'aham brahma asmi'. And the Taittiriya Upanishad says about that Brahman: *satyam* jnanam anantam *brahma.* So, one can easily see how far removed from truth is your contention. Pl. get your Vedanta knowledge correct: only jIvatvam is an illusion and not the svarUpa.

Great realization.

For your information it is जहदजहल्लक्षणा or भागत्यागलक्षणा.

Here is where the jahadajahallakShaNA operates and the jIva's true self is salvaged by discarding the unreal accretions.

You are wrong. When it is said: '....it no longer remains when knowledge dawns' what is meant is: 'it no longer remains as real.'
Shankara says in the Bh.Gita bhashyam 2.16:  
  
त्वमपि तत्त्वदर्शिनां दृष्टिमाश्रित्य शोकं मोहं च हित्वा शीतोष्णादीनि नियतानियतरूपाणि द्वन्द्वानि *'विकारोऽयमसन्नेव* *मरीचिजलवन्मिथ्यावभासते'* इति मनसि निश्चित्य तितिक्षस्व इत्यभिप्रायः।।  
  
Shankara says in the commentary for Bhagavadgita verse: 13.26 :  
यथाशास्त्रं क्षेत्र-क्षेत्रज्ञलक्षणभेदपरि

ज्ञानपूर्वकं प्राग्दर्शितरूपात् क्षेत्रात् मुञ्जादिव ईषीकां यथोक्तलक्षणं क्षेत्रज्ञं प्रविभज्य ’न सत्तन्नासदुच्यते’ \[गी.१३.१२\] इत्यनेन निरस्तसर्वोपाधिविशेषं ज्ञेयं ब्रह्म स्वरूपेण य: पश्यति, क्षेत्रं च मायानिर्मितहस्ति-स्वप्नदृष्टवस्तु-गन्धर्वनगरादिवत् असदेव सदिव अवभासते इत्येवं निश्चितविज्ञान: य:, तस्य यथोक्तसम्यग्दर्शनविरोधात् अपगच्छति मिथ्याज्ञानम् ।  
\[This illusion vanishes, because of its opposition to the right knowledge, when a man attains to a knowledge of the distinction between Kshetra and Kshetrajna as defined in the Shastra, when he is able to separate Kshetrajna from Kshetra like the ishikaa reed from the munja-grass and to realize that Brahman, the Knowable, which is devoid of all upadhis as described in the words ‘It is not said to be existent or non-existent’ (BG 13.12) as his own Self, when he is convinced that, like the elephants and palaces projected by a juggler’s art, or like a thing seen in a dream, or like a gandharvanagara (an imaginary city in the sky), Kshetra is non-existent and only appears to be existent.\]  

  
So, you are wrong when you give the example of mirage-water to counter my point. So, the appearance of the mirage-water and the knowledge that it is unreal can happily and does coexist.

Yes. He clearly sees that the non-advaiti is deluded to the extent of becoming disillusioned.

By you and for you.

Sorry to point out this fundamental truth. When someone says they are imaginary what they mean is 'they are imaginary on the physical planet Earth.' They do not exist on the physical plane. No one can see those lines in the geographical places they live for the simple reason that they do not exist. The Teacher spreads the Atlas and points out to 'India' there and says: 'this is India, we live here'. Surely the piece of land painted on the Atlas is not the geographical India where the Teacher and the pupils really live. Both know this fact very well. Yet the teaching about the imaginary India on the imaginary 'world' on the Atlas serves the purpose of generating correct knowledge about the positions of continents and countries.

See for yourself your biggest fallacy:

an imaginary thing or event, postulated for the purposes of argument or explanation.  
\[this definition fits accurately in the Atlas/latitude, etc. context.\]  
  
<http://wiki.answers.com/Q/What_is_the_meaning_of_fiction_and_non-fiction>  
Fiction-means not true  
Non-fiction means real  
  
<http://www.answers.com/topic/unreal>  

1.  Not real or substantial; illusory.

The Apte English-Sanskrit dictionary gives:  
  
fiction: कल्पना, मनःकल्पना, मानसी सृष्टिः and for other derivatives of 'fiction': कृतक, कल्पित, असत्य, मृषार्थक, मिथ्या..  
unreal: असार, मायात्मक, अतथ्य  
  
At best you are only trying to make a distinction between 'fictional' and 'unreal'. Advaitins have this kind of differentiation already: bhrama and buddhi-pUrvaka-Aropa. In 'adhyAropa-apavAda nyAya', it is the buddhipUrvaka Aropa, as in the case of the Veda: कथं चानृतेन मोक्षशास्त्रेण प्रतिपादितस्यात्मैकत्वस्य सत्यत्वमुपपद्येत? \[BSB 2.1.14\]. In the case of 'gumma', it is bhrama for the child and buddhi-pUrvaka-Aropa for the mother. When the child grows up to see through the trick, it realizes it to be the latter only resorted to by the mother.

You are wrong again. I can see the frustration in your words. Till date, from several centuries, arguments are conducted, both in vocal and print media. It is the non-Advaitins that organize such meets largely to engage the Advaitins. As I pointed out in the latest such assembly it was acknowledged that 'there is a need to understand Advaita correctly in order to understand the Dvaita work 'nyAyAmRta' correctly.'

Yes, they establish that there is nothing that the critics can really say against Advaita.

This wisdom could have arisen before you first responded.  

>

After making so much noise about mirage, a silence that follows only shows how one is tired after running towards the mirage water.  

>

Your idea about the mirage analogy has been shown to be wrong and without any basis in the Advaitic works.   

>

You have hope in the Kathopanishat 1.2.18:  
न जायते म्रियते वा *विपश्चित्*....\[The *intelligent* Self is neither born nor dies...\] vipashchit: medhAvI aviparilupta-chaitanya-svabhAvAt (shankara bhashya).  
  
You keep repeating that the advaitin holds the jiva to be unreal/illusion. I have repeatedly shown that such is not the case.
Your upakrama and upasamhara are both flawed.
