Can you list the 'many' schools of Advaita, their distinctive features, and show the source of your information? And how those schools compare with the many schools of Buddhism?

These are the words of a Dvaitin scholar about Advaita

Your complete ignorance of the Vedanta is evident from your above words. Can you show by whom and where such a 'postulation' is made?
Quotes from the canonical works of Advaita will be the most welcome ones here.

No one has succeeded in proving this even after centuries of criticism of Advaita.

No one says the latitudes are longitudes are real lines:  
  
<http://www.preservearticles.com/201101032438/latitudes-and-longitudes.html>  
  
// The point that is the farthest north on the Earth is called the North Pole and the point farthest south is the South Pole. If you look at the globe carefully you will see a line drawn across its centre. *This is an imaginary line drawn between the two poles* This line divides the Earth into two equal halves. It is called the Equator. The part of the Earth that lies north of the equator is called the Northern Hemisphere ('hemi' means half) and the half to the south is called the Southern Hemisphere. *We use imaginary lines to locate places on a globe.* The horizontal lines running from east to west are called latitudes. These latitudes are running parallel to each other and the equator so they never meet.//

Thanks for acknowledging this. This is the crux of my posts on Gumma.

No one disputes this. In fact the *fictional* Gumma is invoked only because it creates *real* fear in children and bring about the real needed behaviour from them. You are only confirming what I have already said in those posts. Thanks for that. You are, by the two statements: 'Nobody doubts that there is no Gumma.' and ' The reality that people can be scary' are reiterating my theme: 'an unreal can and does bring about a real effect.'

Yes. Such a combination is what helps in getting a real effect. The very locus (gumma) of these real attributes is fictional, even as you have admitted. It is like saying 'there is a vandhyAputra who is 5' 11".'

Yes. this is what the whole theme is about. There is no person at all but the non-existing person is invoked to bring about real effect. That also shows that those attributes have no real locus to stand on. You are not saying anything new than only reiterating what my article means.

True. The world fiction is forever dependent on the True Brahman. The superimposed snake is possible only where there is a real rope. Without adhiShThAna no Aropa can take place.

An illusion is unreal because it is caused by ignorance. And ignorance itself is unreal because it no longer remains when knowledge dawns. There fails your claim of 'infinite regress':   

>

No critic of Advaita,however great he is, has succeeded in proving the supposed infinite regression in Advaita.

Since the 'infinite regress' charge itself does not stand, what is built upon it also meets the same fate. It is evident that what you say about viveka above is also not founded in Advaita. You have to do a lot of homework.

Advaita never admits a, any, thought to survive sublation. Only Brahman stays without getting sublated.

Very nice indeed. The 'world' is only a word:वाचारम्भणं विकारो नामधेयम्.. Nothing can be a *part* of Brahman because Brahman is taught in the Upanishad as without any parts: 'niShkalam...niravayavam..anantam...pUrNam..chidghanam..prajnAna'

It is apparent to everyone now as to how poor is the critic in his assimilating the knowledge about not just Advaita but even the Upanishads (Vedanta).

Your deep ignorance of Adi Shankara's Bhashya's is exhibited here. What are the 'several' of the 'previous' works of Shankara that you have studied? How do you arrive at the chronology of those works? Take a sabbatical, pl. study them first and then make public pronouncements about Shankaracharya. Or as a quick move, go through the archives of this forum where I have cited many a passage from the prasthAnatraya Bhashya about what Shankara has said on bhakti.

There is no evolution of Vedanta. Its teaching is for ever the same.
