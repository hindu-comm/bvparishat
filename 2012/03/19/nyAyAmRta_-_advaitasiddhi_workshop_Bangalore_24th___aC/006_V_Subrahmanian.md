I repeat my reply posted elsewhere to the above comment:  
  
// ‘Fruitful’ for whom? For the critic who is bent upon not understanding Advaita no discussion with an advaitin can be fruitful.//  
  
Scholars of the Dvaita and Vishishtadvaita schools have been having discussions with Advaitin scholars for the last several centuries or at least decades. They continue their deliberations on a common platform even to this day. The one I attended just two days ago is a most recent proof of this. Everyone acknowledges that it is a difficult task understanding Advaita. Dr. Haridasa Bhattacharya made a significant remark: 'Advaita has several distinct thought patterns within itself.
It is only for a scholar of the stature of Dr.Mani Dravid SastriNaH is it possible to explain these without mixing them up. And we are fortunate to learn Advaita from such a scholar.'  
  
While for a true mumukshu the various finer details of the different schools within Advaita is not necessary, these very distinct and varied thoughts have come up in the wake of objections raised by other schools, as an explanation of the Advaitic position.or as alternative ways of explaining things. Thus, most of these are only vAdi-specific and not essentially sAdhana-specific. Someone who is not trained adequately in the methods of these various internal thoughts would find it confusing or at least extremely difficult to understand them. In my experience with such meets I have found that many questions come from the other schools regarding these subtle differences.  
  
And the pAramArthika-vyAvahArika concept in Advaita is a hard nut to crack. This poses the greatest challenge to anyone embarking upon understanding Advaita. Only when one studies under a well trained teacher of the sampradAya can one succeed in correctly understanding this concept.
