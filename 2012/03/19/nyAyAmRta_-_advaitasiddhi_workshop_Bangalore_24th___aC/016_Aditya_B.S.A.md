नमो नमः

  

"I think we have indulged in testing the patience of the members at large on this forum. You are welcome to continue the exchange with me by private email and not on the public forum." 

  

I appreciate your courteousness, and will definitely interact with you over personal e-mail in future, for I consider the interactions quite educative. However, I continue to reply in a public forum purely to point out that certain licenses that you assume while talking about Advaita (in a public forum) are absolutely unjustified coming from a scholar like you, and serve to do nothing but present our philosophical systems in a bad light. By the end of this mail, my point will be demonstrated in no uncertain terms.

  

I am a learner, not a mindless critic as you consider; for I come from a generation that largely doesn't harbor blind grudges against people out of xenophobic rage.

  

I have respect for your scholastic capability, but only in the context of you being an Advaita scholar. When you make a statement like this:

> 
> > 
> >   
> It will take several kalpa-s for non-advaitins to learn that in > Advaita there are no 'two': brahman AND jiva. There is only one.   
> > 
> > 
> > >

...your scholastic capability issuperseded by a lack of common sense. I wonder, when you make such statements, how you are capable of ever interpreting Vedanta properly.

  

Let us analyse the statement you made. Assuming that what you say is true:  
  

1\. As an Advaitin, you know that in Advaita there is only one.

  

2\. I am a non-advaitin. You say that it will take several kalpas for me to know that in Advaita there is no Brahman and Jiva. There is only one.

  

Kindly realize:

  

Nobody is born an advaitin or a non-advaitin (notwithstanding that we are born into a system that generates an identification with a particular school). One learns Advaita, or any other system, and then considers whether they want to be a part of it, or not.

  

Advaitins understand that there is only one. You were not an advaitin at birth. You studied Advaita, and understood that there is only one.

  

The implications are:

  

1\. If you have realized oneness, then according to your philosophy, you are a liberated soul.

  

2. If you have not realized this---you are a believer in it, who is trying to understand it, or

  

3\. If you have not realized this---you are a person who understands it otherwise.

  

Let us take your case, Sri. Subrahmanian.

  

1. You have realized this. Then you are a liberated soul. I congratulate you. Even in your state of liberation, you have to suffer detractors like me.

  

2\. You have not realized this, but you believe in it, and are in the process of realization. So you're still perceiving a difference from Oneness. Unfortunately for you, by your own statement, you will take several kalpas to perceive oneness. (But you are almost there? You have almost realized it? I'm coming to that later.)

  

3\. You have not realized this, and you realize it otherwise. Like any reasonable person, you take into consideration context and purport, and realize that the truth is different from Advaita. But no, Sri Subrahmanian, this cannot be you, because you are an indefatigable Advaitin.

  

Moral of the story?

  

1\. If you are an Advaiti, you are a liberated soul.

  

2\. If you are not a liberated soul, but you are a believer in Advaita, good luck trying to learn or realize oneness in this life, for Sri Subrahmanian will have you know that you are doomed to several kalpas of rebirth. All the hapless Advaitins who are caught up in samsara---I sure hope you have the virtue of patience. But you earnestly want to believe that you will realize oneness, and everyday, you wake up, thinking the world is an illusion.

  

Don't worry, there are going to be a number of subtle, profound, intricate pramanic truths, no doubt learnt only from competent Advaita scholars, which will have you believe that if you are in fact an almost-liberated soul who is suffering the aftereffects of having been in touch with maya for so long.

  

If I was looking for a hangover I would go drinking. My liberation is free from hangovers, or whatever fancy name you have for it.

  

With great respect to the wishes of Sri Subrahmanian, I will stop replying on this topic in the public forum if there are no further unwarranted remarks about true mumukshus, which are insinuative of an opinion that regards Advaita as having a monopoly on liberation. This is absolutely baseless, false, and not an opinion to be projected on a forum such as this. You can keep that illusion restricted to your advaita mailing list.

  

Regards,

  

Aditya.
