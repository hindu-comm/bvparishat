नमो नमः



"Only when one studies under a well trained teacher of the sampradAya can one succeed in correctly understanding this concept."



Thanks for your replies. I do understand that studying under a competent Advaita teacher can bring about therather astoundingeffect of sublation that you have explained in some depth in your blog posts.



My misgivings about this nihilistic line of interpretation of Vedanta, however, are very real.



I have great respect for Adishankara Bhagavatpada,towardswhom every follower of Vedanta owes a debt of gratitude forpropagatingVedantic philosophy at a time when other schools were gaining rampant prominence in our land.



However, these very dire circumstances provided the fuel for nihilistic Advaita, which by no means is restricted to Vedanta as a philosophy. One of the epithets for the Buddha in the Amarakosha is 'Advayavaadi.' It is understandable that in order to establish Vedanta's supremacy, it was postulated by the philosophers of the time that this kind of Advaita has a more refined exposition in Vedanta than in the Buddhist doctrine, in order to bring back to the fold those who were embracing Buddhism.



All the schools of Advaita, and all the schools of Buddhism (and there are many of both), have the common undercurrent of nihilism, and the "strong inbuilt reasoning based method to establish it on firm grounds," as Sri Subrahmanian would have one believe, gathers its strength not from the strength of pramana, but from the gullibility of the poor seeker of knowledge who is made to believe in earnest that he can be liberated when he realizes that everything is an illusion, except Brahma, which is postulated as Pure Consciousness.This is definitely liberation in a sense. Liberation from tenability of any kind.



Sri Subrahmanian's blog posts would appear convincing only superficially, but owing to the subject matter, its potential to beguile is quite tremendous. The adbhutam blog-post has provided some pramanic references, such as the Uddhava Gita, and based on these references and several other worldly examples (in the two other blogs), we see an argument being made for the 'unreal' being the cause of real knowledge.



All the following things, such as the 'gumma,' the Indian Bogeyman, the fake calf, latitudes and longitudes, and letters of the script, are proclaimed as unreal objects causing real knowledge.



This is the first, and most beguiling fallacy. All the above objects are real objects causing real knowledge.



Let us take the fabled gumma that Sri Subrahmanian has quoted in more than one place.



Nobody doubts that there is no Gumma. But this figment of imagination is based on multitudinous realities. The reality that people can be scary. That they can carry away children. That if someone does not behave nicely, they can be punished for it.



These realities are found all over the world. You cannot even say that they are not the attributes of the fictional Gumma. They are very real attributes of Gumma.



The only thing about Gumma that is 'fictional' is that there is a person referred to by that name whose occupation is to carry away badly behaved children.



Any such fiction is forever dependent on truth and reality. That is because of the nature of fiction. No fiction can be so contrived that it is not based on reality.



Anything that is fictitious, or 'unreal' has to be of the nature of 'not here, not in this person, not at this time.' One can use both 'and' and 'or' operators between them.



To say, as Advaita does, that the illusion is unreal--is to say that the illusion is an illusion.



No exponent of Advaita,*however great he is,*can escape from the mire of infinite regression that results from this philosophy.



The so called viveka that one miraculously attains in the midst of this infinite regression, however, is propped up only from sheer denial to consider that this viveka is also illusive, if one were to accept this philosophy. This denial is because Advaitis consider this viveka in itself to be liberation.



This is what it translates to: A person, out of sheer denial, refuses to believe anything is real. The same person, out of sheer stubbornness, then excludes one particular thought from that equation. That thought comes from the so-called mahavakya and such pramanas. But they are not real. They are sublated. But the thought? That is real. Why? Because, in the words of Sri Subrahmanian,'it does not produce any utility whatsoever. And it never gets sublated.'



I definitely accept सर्वं खल्विदंब्रह्म. But not by excluding the world

from the definition of Brahma. The word is a part of Brahma.



This should be apparent to those who aren't swayed by the

current of nihilistic obstinacy.



Adishankara Bhagavatpaada lived only for 32 years. Having debunked Bhakti in several of his previous works, in his last years he sang Bhaja Govindam.



Maybe one should consider that had he lived longer, his philosophy would have evolved more.



I conclude out of respect for that great soul, and with the hope that this trend of classifying Advaitis as 'true mumukshus,' which Sri Subrahmanian has been doing in several places, will cease immediately. For no true mumukshu would ever consider that he has the authority to classify another as a true mumukshu or otherwise.



Regards,



Aditya.
