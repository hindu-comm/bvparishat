> Namaste..  

In fact I have also been raising this type of basic questions and logical inconsistencies in the Advaita philosophy as some of my earlier comments/responses in this thread would show.  
And , now Sri Aditya also is raising the same points.  
  
Aditya has succinctly said: "And that, people, is exactly why nobody can argue with Advaita. "  
  
I fully concur with him and repeat my comment posted elsewhere: " . . .That is the reason these Advaita Vedanta followers cannot fruitfully and logically enter into any discussion on such concepts".  
  
Ganesan
