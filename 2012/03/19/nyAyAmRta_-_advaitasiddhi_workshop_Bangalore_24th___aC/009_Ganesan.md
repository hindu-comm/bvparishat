This is the actual position of the Vedanta, the Upanishad-s. Any passage there testifies to this view only.  
In order to stress the infallible reality of Brahma, the manifested world is nowhere said in these texts to be 'illusory' or unreal or not-existing in the ultimate (paaramaarthika) sense,,,, etc., etc.,  
Just one passage,  
आकाशशरीरं ब्रह्म । सत्यात्म प्राणारामं मन आनन्दम् ।  
tells it clearly.  
From where does mithyaatva come ? Why should the world be mithyaa at all ? What is the purpose achieved by declaring the world unreal or illusory ? The maayii-possessor of that inscrutable power, maayaa--can very well create and have the world as His one of His modes, which shows His mutifarious power. By this nowhere His power is mitigated or His uniqueness subordinated. This is the true position of Vedanta which Srikantha brings out in his commentry on the Brahmasuutra-s so well.
