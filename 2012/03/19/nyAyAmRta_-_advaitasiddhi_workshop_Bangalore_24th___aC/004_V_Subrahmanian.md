There is a little more explanation in this page on the topic, engendered by a question/doubt that came up upon my initial report:  
  
<http://groups.yahoo.com/group/advaitin/message/55829>  
  
  
Here I reproduce a post sent to me by a member of BVP:  
  
Dear Sri Subramanian!

  

Jaya Guru Datta.

  

I am deeply impressed by your chronicle about the Advaita Siddhi - Nyayamruta workshop.

Such impartial coverage and attempts to explain Sastra Vishaya, would be beneficial to at least few people, who are interested in the subject; though not endowed with abilities in Sanskrit.

  

All the best. We invite you to continue such coverage at our events at Mysore.

  
With Warm Regards  
Dr.Vamshi K Ghanapaathi
