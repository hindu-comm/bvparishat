Given in the below email are links to Ramayana resources. The IIT Kanpur site is very amibitious - they want to offer the moola, English translation of the original, commentaries and English translation of the original. The mulagrantha is already made available in multiple scripts and a new word by word English translation has been made available till the end of Sundarakanda. The commentaries in Sanskrit seem to be made available till the end of Sundarakanda.

  

Amazing effort! Jai ho! IIT, Kanpur and Padmavati Mahila University, Tirupati (they are the ones who have started this project). These are world class resources.

  

In all this, there is one intriguing observation. The Tilaka is said to be written by Nagoji Bhatta or Rama Verma. The verses in the beginning clearly indicate that it is Rama who has written this. The preface to the Anandaashrama edition says that the commentary is written by Nagoji Bhatta. I wonder if some other information is available to show that Nagesa Bhatta has written the commentary Tilaka.
