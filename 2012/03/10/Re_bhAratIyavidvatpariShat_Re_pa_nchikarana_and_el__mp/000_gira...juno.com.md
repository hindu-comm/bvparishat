Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



What is meant by Skandha as used in "ParamANunAm bandhah skandhah"?





To meShree S.R.Krishnamurthylooks like a person of both science and Vaidika knowledge.I have a couple of questions for him as well as for other scholars of this list.



I hear Sanskrit words ANu and ParamANu several times in connection with Vaishes'ika darshana. The atom in modern physics is divisible. It has parts (protons, neutron, electrons).Was there any reference in the ancient Indian books that ANuwas divisible and it has parts? Secondly what is exactly meant by ParamANu? Is ParamANu bigger than ANu or smaller than ANu anddoes it haveparts? Is paramANu a molecule? Is there Sanskrit word for electron in the ancient Indian books?. Jain work says "binding of paramAnUs is called Skandha. There are many meanings to the word 'skandha' in Apte's dictionary. References will be appreciated rather than guess work.



Jain also use words aNu and paramANu for shabdas. To me it looks that in the ancient Indian books words ANu and ParamANu were used to indicate some small particles. So perhaps to superimpose on the ancient Indian words concepts from modern physics may not be right. I may be corrected.Thanks. N.R.Joshi.

my dear Dr. Rajaram,



I added the orbit for additional info. But the ratha is pure spin and is clearly defined by yaska; of which I have given the reference, so that you may kindly verify or get it verified acc. to your convenience. Ra stands for rotation; and tha for stationariness. If it is the only instance of similarity between the Vedas and the modern science, its dismissal as a mere overlap may perhaps be appropriate, but the abundance of evidences of scientific data in vedas do not justify mere dismissal; because we will thereby deprive ourselves the opportunity to know better; and deprive the whole world the higher knowledge; which I consider we have no right to do.
