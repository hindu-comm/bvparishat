Dear Dr.Narayanan,  
Excuse me for the delay in responding. Can you please clarify or  
elaborate your query a bit further.  
  
Since you say that you like to know in 'Detail' and about their  
performance, I am diffident. I am not an Ahitaagni and my knowledge on  
the esoteric/mystical side is nothing to write about.  
My interest is to extract or understand the physical background of the  
Vedic texts (the adhidaiva-paksha of Nirukta) wherever it appears  
amenable for analysis. This is how I studied the number 3339 of the  
Rigveda and found that it has close connection with the DP-Vedi also.  
Further some of the DP-hymns specifically refer to the wish of the  
Yajamana to attain the place near the 'Saptarshi' which perhaps one  
can equate with 'Svarga'. The Brahman of the Yaaga also endorses this  
wish. Apastamba S'rauta sutra text provides the details. The original  
hymns as is known appear in the Tai.Sam and Tai. Be. The recently  
published book on DP-rites by Ve. Br. Sri Paranjape of Mysore is very  
comprehensive covering several Sutra procedures.  
  
My surmise is the ritual which is variously called yajna/yaaga/Is.t.i  
in different places should have started in response to some remarkable  
experience in the sky passed on from generation to generation. The  
original event might have been even a calamity. In the DP-rites the  
Brhama-varaNam is interesting. The Brahman or the officiating priest  
is identified with Bhuupati, Bhuvanapati and BhUtapati who died in  
more ncient times doing their duty for the Gods. The anuyāja offerings  
in DP-rite goes to them (writing from memory hence to be verified).  
One of them Bhuutapati as per the Aitareya Br is the celestial Agni  
that hit the Prajapati. These were the elder brothers of ‘SaucIka  
agni’ of the Saucika hymns of RV 10.51,52,53 and RV 3.9, from where  
the number 3339 originates.  
  
My physical identification is that the ‘three brothers’ were comets  
and the event (I have posted this on BVP already) ended up as a  
climate change with Sun obscured for a long time. This might have led  
to long period of speculation about Man and his position in the  
Universe. One outcome of this was recognizing eclipses and their  
periodicity from observation using the Vedi. This is the primary  
thrust of my work. In the short note I have not written about the  
above background.  
  
From what I have understood so far Vedic Rishis, as revealed in the  
available texts, realized experientially the underlying unity among  
the visible world, outer space and the mental /psychic or internal  
space that was later known as Chidaakaasha. The rituals including DP  
evolved as techniques (technology or tantra) of preserving and  
transferring this experience to future generations.  
  
No doubt there is some overlap between astronomy and the Vedic sky  
pictures but Vedic texts do not report experiments; they describe  
experiential results in figurative language.  
  
I have only discussed your post further, but not answered! You write:  
“…astronomical significance which can make an impact…”. I did not  
follow this, please clarify.  
  
Best regards  
  
RN Iyengar
