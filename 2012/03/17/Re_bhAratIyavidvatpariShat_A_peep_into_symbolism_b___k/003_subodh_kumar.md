Sir,  
You have made very erudite analysis underlying DP ceremonies.  
A systems engineer can also see on more mundane levels that DP ceremonies are a frame work of managing complete system of Cow based Agriculture in society. The mantras of Shukla Yajurved chapters 1 completely describe the activities of Darsheshti . It is called darsheshti because it concerns with the present and visible state of management as it exists .ie what ever is in Darsh ie visible. And Pournmaseshti the recall of the wisdom of the past traditions of the pitars the elders of the past, and analysis of how the current practices needed a correction in the present practices.  
Very systematically from the very first mantra इषे त्वोर्जे त्वा .... it describes the scope of the entire system ie a cow based agriculture system for producing food from health giving अनमीवा inputs. Second mantra वसो: पवित्रमसि ... lays healthy and clean living conditions for all, by laying down importance of green पवित्र: surroundings with sunlight द्यौरसि and पृथिव्यसि raw clean earth to tread upon and मा ह्वार्मा यज्ञपति र्ह्वार्षीत to never abandon the practice of
fumigation by agnihotras. Third mantra देव सविता पुनातु वसो: पवित्रेण शतधरेण सुप्वा कामधुक्ष: monitors the milk yield of the best cows brought to the ceremony and the yajman asks which cow gave how much milk. The procedure and practice of milking got inspected by the learned persons .This is because the cow and its milk are the basic building blocks for the entire edifice of civilization as described in the fourth mantra. सा विश्वायु: सा विश्वकर्मा सा विश्वधारा: ... Next follows the importance of truthfully honestly observing and reporting the entire proceedings by अग्ने व्रतपते व्रतं चरिष्यामि ...... . As any operator of modern total quality management systems such as ISO 9000 knows, the most significant for any system is acceptance of the ground rule of observing and honestly reporting the entire proceedings by complete adherence to truth.  
Like this example of the first few mantas, a study of subsequent mantras shows the existence of a central community based institutional system which operated as a community resource center. This institution played the role of Monitoring the skills and practices followed for
Promoting, Training and Educating the community by dissemination of good knowledge and Skills in all aspects related to Pastoral livelihood and life support activities, involving.  
This was the Vedic form of modern agriculture extension centers and monitored the state of art and trained for best practices.  

 1.Animal husbandry,- inspection of cows' health and milk productivity-

 inspection and suitability of currently produced feeds and so on.  

2.Agriculture related areas like

 a.Selection and Preservation of Quality Seed- random selection of samples from cart laden with grains- grinding and baking in ashes the purodash and studying its taste for best edibility- selecting the sweetest grains as seeds for next season and so on.  

 b. Seed Banks for next harvests,

 c. Inspection of farm implements like tools,carts,

 d. Community decisions on health , feed strategies for cows

e.Disposal of non productive not fit for domestic purposes cattle अबंधनीय animals etc.

All these activities formed the subject of a community base yagna called Darshpournmaseshti.

.Modern concept of Krishi Vigyan Kendras could evolve to play this role.

The rituals of **nù¶ÉÇ{ÉÉähÉÇ¨ÉÉºÉäÎ¹\]õ** Darsh Pourn Maseshti, are
seen as the Vedic system of modern management like ISO 9000, covering entire AgroEconmic activities of the society.

**This calls for a very scholarly study by involvement of modern veterinary , agriculture and soil scientists, in to the practical utilization of Vedic institutions of the the Indian Cows and Sustainable Organic Agriculture.

With my Pranams to the learned and seeking more wisdom,
