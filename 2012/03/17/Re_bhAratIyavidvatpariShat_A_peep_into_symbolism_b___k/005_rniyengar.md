Dear Sri Kumar,  
Thanks for your post. You have added another dimension to DP-rites. It  
is true that the principles behind many of the Vedic prescriptions  
resemble modern best management practices. It is nice you have brought  
out this fact. The Shukla and Krishna Yajurveda hymns are not much  
different. Vedic sacrifices represent strong team spirit and well knit  
community participation. Your explanation of 'darsheshti,  
Pournmaseshti' appears to be too modern, but may be one can see it  
from different angles. Not being a specialist in TQM etc I leave it  
for others to discuss further.  
  
Thanks once again for your response (including the one on Scribd)

\> 2.Agriculture related areas like  
\>  
\>  a.Selection and Preservation of Quality Seed- random selection of samples  
\> from cart laden with grains- grinding and baking in ashes the purodash and  
\> studying its taste for best edibility- selecting the sweetest grains as  
\> seeds for next season and so on.  
\>  
\>  b. Seed Banks for next harvests,  
\>  
\>  c. Inspection of farm implements like tools,carts,  
\>  
\>  d. Community decisions on health , feed strategies for cows  
\>  
\> e.Disposal of non productive not fit for domestic purposes cattle अबंधनीय  
\> animals etc.  
\>  
\> All these activities formed the subject of a community base yagna called  
\> Darshpournmaseshti.  
\>  
\> .Modern concept of Krishi Vigyan Kendras could evolve to play this role.  
\>  

\> The rituals of \*nù¶ÉÇ{ÉÉähÉÇ¨ÉÉºÉäÎ¹\]õ\* Darsh Pourn Maseshti, are seen  

\> as the Vedic system of modern management like ISO 9000, covering entire  
\> AgroEconmic activities of the society.  

\> \*This calls for a very scholarly study by involvement of modern veterinary  

\> , agriculture and soil scientists, in to the practical utilization of  
\> Vedic institutions of the the Indian Cows and Sustainable Organic  
\> Agriculture.
