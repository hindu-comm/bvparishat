Respected Professor Iyengar,  
Thank you very much for your invaluable reply.  
My question was : What could be the astronomical significance which can make an impact by any type of iṣṭiḥ as the darśapūrṇamāsa is one among like agnihotra? And precisely what I meant is :  
The timings (muhūrta, night, day, season etc.) of the performance of each iṣṭiḥ have been categorized like the darśapūrṇamāsa etc. with a view to achieving a particular auspecious target. Such timings are calculated on the basis of changing locations of the celestial bodies and some particular coincidence of some of them make an auspecious timing to make the performance successful. The iṣṭi-s like kārīrī etc. are performed with a view to expecting rain during drought. वेदैकदेशं दृष्ट्वा तु कारीरी वृष्टिबोधकम्। अदृष्टयोश्च विश्वासः कार्यः स्वर्गापवर्गयोः ॥१२॥ (शङ्कराचार्यविरचितः सर्वसिद्धान्तसङ्ग्रहः -12). What I wanted to know is while prescribing the timings (muhūrta, night, day, season etc.) what are the coincidences of various celestial bodies are expected which are supposed to make impacts to each iṣṭiḥ : like kārīrī, agnihotra, darśapūrṇamāsa etc.
