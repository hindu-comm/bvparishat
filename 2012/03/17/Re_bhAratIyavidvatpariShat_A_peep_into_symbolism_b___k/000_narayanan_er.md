Respected Professor Iyengar,

Good afternoon. I would like to know about darśa and pūrṇamāsa in detail. As darśa and pūrṇamāsa are said to be performed on the pratipadā-s (pratipadam-s) after the new-moon and full-moon respectively.   

The statements like : प्रमाणानुयाजादिभिरुपकृतवद्भ्यां दर्शपूर्णमासाभ्यां स्वर्गकामो यजेत (Bṛhadāraṇyakopaniṣad-1.7- Śaṅkarabhāṣya) are aiming heaven. What could be the astronomical significance which can make an impact by any type of iṣṭiḥ as the darśapūrṇamāsa is one among like agnihotra etc?   

Later the Mahābhārata also mention about darśa and pūrṇamāsa along with the other types of iṣṭi-s, as:  

दर्शे च पूर्णमासे च चातुर्मास्ये पुनः पुनः।  
अयजद्धयमेधेन सहस्रं परिवत्सरान्॥ (महाभारते। १२। २९। ११४।)

The term पौर्णमी (in your article) for full-moon is probably used only in South India, while पूर्णिमा and पौर्णमासी are widely used in other parts. As I am not familiar with the etymology of the term paurṇamī.  
We use kaṟutta vāv and veḻutta vāv for new-moon and full-moon respectively in Malayalam, probably in Tamil too.  
Regards,  
Narayanan
