Dear scholars,



On the same subject there is another thread, to whichI just now answered.



I do not understand why scientists are talking of beliefs.



I have already stated that as a student of physics, I re-state that the Law of conservation of total mass and energy governs the issue. Since Life also is a form of energy, the energy that escapes from one shell must manifest in some other shell. However, it may remain in the energy form until it finds another shell, a seed or a rethas.



scientits may be ignorant of any methodology of investigation of this phinomenon. However as regards matter and energy the Law is accepted. So by projection of the same to the Life dimension, the reincarnation can also be inferred. Else the scientists will have to prove the inapplicability of the Law to Life. Until then, the scientists cannot deny the phenomenon of reincarnation, which is only an application of the Law of Conservation of Mass and Energy.
