hariH OM,  
  
 I don't understand the need to straitjacket all tenets which make a person a "hindu" into the "scientific" mould (with the ultimate purpose of rejecting the "inconvenient").  
  
 If the purpose is to convince those who are already adherents, then it is a futile exercise.  
 If the purpose is to convince those who aren't already adherents (come one, come all, there are no restrictions here, you will be called a hindu regardless of how you live!!!), one needs "scientific" evidence that once convinced of the "scientific-ness" of hinduism, the non-adherents will become adherents.  
 If the purpose is to strengthen the faith of those who are already adherents, then this is just a fig-leaf, but one which is less spectacular than the puruShasUkta-electricity generation thing.  
 If it is none of the above, then it is just intellectual gymnastics which is not connected in anyway with reality.  
  
 Pray, a hindu can be a hindu without adherence to any tenets. How does it make him different from "bohemian", "happy go lucky" etc. (not that these are negative words, but these are words which are quite different from "hindu")?  
  
 I will not accept the apauruSheyatva of veda, still I want to be called a hindu.  
 I will not accept "avashyameva bhoktavyam....." still i want to be called a hindu.  
 I don't accept re-incarnation, still i want to be called a hindu.  
 I will not accept the authority of veda, still i want to be called a hindu.  
 I will covet a parastrii, still i want to be called a hindu (a bit extreme, but hope you get the drift).  
etc. etc.  
  
 The clamour seems to be to make the definition of "hindu" as omnibus as possible. That too in the name of "spiritual freedom", "as non-semitic as you can make it" etc.  
  
 The moment even the question of individual discipline (as dictated by shAstras) is brought up, there is a hue and cry that this is "semitization"! The whole burden of not being "semitic" is on the poor Hindu!  
  
 Let people who don't believe in the precepts of sanAtana dharma call themselves whatever they like, why should we go to them with a begging bowl asking them to call themselves "hindu"?  
  
 Is sanAtana dharma such a fragile thing that it needs this sort of "scientific" apologetics?  
  
svasti,  
 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,  

shrivathsa.
