I agree with the respected scholars, and do apologize to Shri Krishna Murthy if my mail was felt to be rude.  
From time immemorial, some common grounds were assumed by different Indian Religious and philosophical systems and Law of Karma is one in the list primary assumptions. I agree with the views express By Dr. Bhat.

I don't think the Law of Karma is a fundamental tenant (permanent) of Indian Religious Systems, but a tenet of all the Indian Religious systems, supported by philosophical systems in one or other way. This is because in Indian systems of philosophy is not entirely cut out of the religious practices, but as part and parcel of it, developed through the centuries, either Vaishna-s, Shaiva-s or even Jain or Buddhist (can refer to the Jataka story), the bondage from the Law of "karma" and the resultant miseries was the objective of all the philosophical systems.
