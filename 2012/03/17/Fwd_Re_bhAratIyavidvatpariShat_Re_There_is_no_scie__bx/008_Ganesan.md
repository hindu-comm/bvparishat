Very correct observation.  
Nowadyas, in the name of spirituality, progressive thinking and what not, people are insisting for 'abolition' of any discipline or ritual. They seem least to know that without some form of discipline that forms part of the general 'ritual', nothing spiritual can be achived. There comes the necessity of 'yama' and 'niyama'.  
Every religion needs three basics: The doctrines, the legends (beliefs, etc.) and certain ritual practices. All the three are complimentary.  
We are observing in the case of many modern spiritual Guru-s that while they preach 'abrogation' of all rituals and speak very highly of only 'meditation', their devotees start introducing new form of rituals in their congregation while the ancient ones that are time-tested and prescribed in the scriptures (on which these Guru-s give eloquent discourses) are dispensed with in the name of 'accommodating' all !!!.
