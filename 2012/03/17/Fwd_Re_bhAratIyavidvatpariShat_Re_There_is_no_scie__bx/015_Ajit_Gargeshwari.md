As I have said in my earlier in a different thread, your knowledge of Spin, Quantum Mechanics, entropy etc. are misguided Please don't bring in 21 st century science into vedas it is not required, Vedas are complete by itself and it has been understood and explained by scholars over 2 millenniums who were adept in explaining Vedas.  
  
You need not pull in top theoretical and and noble laureate's views without quoting their views accurately. They don't require your incorrect interpretation of science or Vedas.  
  
Keeping my mind open or being open minded does not mean I accept unwarranted and uncalled interpretations into Vedic texts. I have my doubts, have you read Veda's or have you at all, I mean read Vedas with any standard commentary.  
  
When your approach is flawed and misguided naturally you results will be.  
  
Better interpretations to explain vedic texts need not mean flawed and uncalled for interpretations. Please read understand the scope need and purpose of Vedas.
