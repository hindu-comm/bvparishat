Mr. Ajit,



I had already stated that you need not accept my viewsIndeed nobody is bonded to accept my or your views. Acceptance of views depends upon the logicality or otherwise of the views; and not any personality. In a short posting on such subjects, one cannot educate everybody but only try to draw attention in the logic or flaws therein. They are not at all meant for the all-knowing scholars like you.



But your view of Vedas as different from science is flawed and based upon others views. I speak of them with my own personal experience and knowledge after thorough research. I am ready for a thorough debate on the subject at any time; with anyopen-minded persons; but not with skeptics who call themselves as scientists.
