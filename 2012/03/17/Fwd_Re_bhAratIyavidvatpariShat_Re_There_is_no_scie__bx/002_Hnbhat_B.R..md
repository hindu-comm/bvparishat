Very Good Topic taken for discussion which was long ago started by Naciketa with the Lord of Death for a solution:

  

येयं प्रेते विचिकित्सा मनुष्ये

  ऽस्तीत्येके नायमस्तीति चैके ।

एतद्विद्यामनुशिष्टस्त्वयाऽहं

  वराणामेष वरस्तृतीयः ॥ २०॥

देवैरत्रापि विचिकित्सितं पुरा

  न हि सुविङ्य़ेयमणुरेष धर्मः ।

  

The same question whether there is life after this life or not, people say one or other. So you are to give the answer (who is held responsible for death).

  

And as a result of the proceedings of the discussion age old, we have got the कठोपनिषत् whether it was tested in a laboratory or not. Anyhow I do not know for certain whether any test was done for their resolution at that time or any time later.
