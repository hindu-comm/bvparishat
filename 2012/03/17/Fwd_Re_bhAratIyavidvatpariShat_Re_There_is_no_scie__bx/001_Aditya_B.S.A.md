I find that religious people often expect science to support their beliefs.

  

This is quite true. But there is another underlying expectation common to those who expect science to support their religious beliefs. That is the expectation of some kind of benefit accruing from being religious, the benefit being (mistakenly) considered to also be comprehensible by the scientific method.

  

Upon a rigorous questioning of one's intent in being religious, if one concludes that their religiosity is for the benefit of association with an entity that is, ipso facto, extraneous to the scientific method, then the expectation of wanting science to corroborate their beliefs is reduced quite greatly.

  

Regards,

  

Aditya.
