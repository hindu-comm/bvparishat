 Shree Vinekar has hit the nail on the head when he says: "Hinduism does not require that its adherents follow or believe in any "doctrines" or dogma."



 If it does make such a demand it becomes 'Semetized' like Christianity and Islam. Then who decides which belief (mine) is legitimate and which is not (yours)?



 There is no Hindu pope. The various religious leaders (like the Shankaracharyas) can speak only for their own sect not all of Sanatana Dharma.
