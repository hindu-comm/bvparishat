The answer to the following questions rests in understanding the traditional statement, perspective and classification of Vyakrana of SAMSKRUTHAM - covering ' Bhashaa and Chandas' - which Panini -Patanjali, which is a Sampradaya is dealing with ' Vedaga Samskrutham' and not social historical language .



The study of historical social languages of India needs a different approach, right from the understanding of what is Prakrutham-Apabhramsha -Mleccha -jati bhashaa et al distinctly from 'Samskrutham' paradigm.



**The real need now is to find the scholars who can distinguish Sanskrit from Samskrutham; and restore VEDANGA Samskrutham Studies model of Panini-Patanajali.**



***In the limits of my understanding***,



1. a) Traditional position holds : Samskrutham is to be classified and studied as a 'VEDANGA'. b) Traditional posiiton holds :Samskrutham is 'DEVA-BHASHAA'. c) The Amarakosha listed other words Brahmee, Bharatee, Vak, Sarasvatee et al. gives other perspectives of exploring Samskrutham in specific contexts.



The purpose of studying Vyakarana is 'Vak-Darshana' ( = Visioning Speech and Speech Processes = Darshana of Vak and Vak-Prakriya). Vak-Prakriya is explained in the famous shiksha sutra kaarikaa : ' Atmaa buddhyaa samaayktah,...' . In this perspective, the process of learning -practicing Samskrutham is Vangmayam tapah /Vag-Yoga.



This is what uniquely distingusihes SAMSKRUTHAM from all other Social Languages of historic periods, which focus on managing localized communication (= Samvaada, Sambhaashana, Bhashaa - Samparka, Bhaavaabhivyakti).



The aim of ' generating Samskrutha Bhashaa Pada = structuring a True designate word through a series ofrefinements ( = prakriyaa) to bring out a unique sound-sequence-structure = Siddham Pratya-yuktam, Prakriyaa shuddham Samskrutham Padam'- which needsto meet the sutra standard 'Sup-Ting-Antham Padam. In this way,Samskrutha -Pada is ' Padartha -Abhidhana -Shabda' .Every prataya structures a ' localised -finitized communication from the ' Prakruti' pada by a prakriyaa. This is the model of finite expressions of infinite as seen in the world. The reverse philosophical deliberations are seen in Sphota vaada. While Sphota Vaada deliberates on how to realize ' Shabda -Brahma ' ( - wihtout any limitation of the explanation to any one specific language of the world / human or animal language et al) from the sound-streams reaching the ear ( indriya) and procesed further at the layer of Buddhi; the reverse model of How Shabda-Smriti gets articlated in to a True representation of Padartha



Thisis in tune with the philosophcal analysis linked to vedic statement
' Naama -Roope- VyakaravaaNi'.



This key position of tradition is given a good go bye by many in two streams following two critical errors( Exceptions are always there, who do teach these essentials to students).:



\(a\) By Western schoalrs who study Samskrutham as Sanskrit - a historical language of a specific community; thus stripping SAMSKRUTHAM of its links with the elevated states of consciousness related to Veda-Darshana ; the MANTRA dimension.



This error is continuouly endorsed by many oriental scholars who live on this understanding implicitly and repeat parrot like the statement ' During the Vedic Times /Vedic Period ...' ?! What is Vedic history and period ? - Which Acharya sampradaya has endorsed the history and social scale of veda by Roman calendar scale of BCE ?? And tolerating this positon for three hundred years now without raising strong voice ??



(b ) By traditional schools which are NOT teaching the VEDANGA
(Chandas) model of Samskrutham along with Sahitya Bhashaa / Shaastra model;Why prefer teaching of SAMSKRUTHAMin the KAVYA -Sahitya - Shastra -Vedanta lanes of understanding and ignore / reject the ' Chandas model' ? The error is in the hypothesis that 'Chandas ( = Shruti) 'can be lingusitically totally understood using bhashaa-vyakarana.



Panini-Patanjali traiditon provide the clues clearly how to 'See Pada' (Vak-Darshana) - from ' Speak using Pada-samooha / as Vakya' ( Vaachaarambhana , Satya-Vaak, Priya -hitam').



The fault isin starting Vyakarana studieswithout the foundational base of SHIKSHAA Shastra ; and integrating it in to the Nirukta ( = Meaning of Words, as Kosha)- Chandas ( - Flow of Sounds as Sukta /Kavya / Gati).Jyotisha and Kalpa would be needed to ugade Bhashaa to Chandas level .



The tradiitonal schools need to restore back this 'Prak-Kruta' model of Vedanga studies to the SAMSKRUTHA model of Vedanga Studies; When Panini-Vyakarana will emerge as 'Vedanga Vyakarna'.



Without restoring this core vision of traiditon, the objections raised by western schools on Indian Languges studies can not be properly addressed.



***What is Vedanga Model of teaching Samskrutham? Why is it to be restored ?*** : Vedanga -Vyakarna PAddhati isthe method of impartng instruction of Samskrutham which answers the criterion laid down by Patanjali in Mahabhashya: Paspashahnika in the lines : Kimartham Adhyeyam Vyakaranam ? Rakshohaagamalaghvasandeharthah prayojanam. This is amplified in Bhashya by the citations of vedic references - uta tvah pashyan ( = Vyakarana for Vak-Darshana), yastu prayungte ( = Speaking Samskrutham as Vak-Yoga / Samskrutha Shabda as Mantra) . Chatvari shrungah ( = Template of how to construct and analyze the Vibhakti-Pratyaya grid of Samskrutha Vyakarana Prakriyaa). Final purification of the word ( titavunaa punanthah, yatra dheera, mansaa vacham akrata).



The goalof Samskrutham speaking is True Articualtion of Thought to Truthfully Totally represent the Designated. ( Pada for a Padartha-Darshana). The outcome of this is 'Bhadraishaam Lakshmeeh nihitaa adhi Vaachi'. And if todays Sanskrit movement is limited to 'Mama Naama /Tava naama', we have a long journey to cover in restoring -recovering Samskrutham from 'Sanskrit' !
