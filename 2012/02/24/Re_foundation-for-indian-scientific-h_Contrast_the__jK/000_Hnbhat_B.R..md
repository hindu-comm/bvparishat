The easiest solution is to learn Veda-s first and then Vedanga-s next and among six Vedangq-s at least VyakaraNa.

  

All the rest is next. True spirit of the Age of Veda-s restored.

  

All quoting Patanjali insisting the need, one line was forgotten:

\\

  

1.  

    

    तथा वेदमधीत्य*त्वरिता वक्तारो भवन्ति*। वेदान्नो वैदिका: सिद्धा:
    लोकाच्च लौकिका: । अनर्थकं व्याकरणमिति तेभ्य
    एवंविप्रतिपन्नबुद्धिभ्योऽध्येतृभ्य आचार्य: प्रयोजनानि व्याचष्टे
    इमानि प्रयोजनानि नित्यमध्येयं व्याकरणमिति । तत्र**...**  

    

    

2.  This was the position 2000 years ago and what to say of it today
    when every one is busy with seeking living of his own?

Certainly one more Patanjali should come to convince the students and attempt again पस्पश afresh for this time.

In short, the situation had not during these 2000 years and how many years to come we will have to change it with out new approach?

  

  

Thanks for the reply to those have replied.
