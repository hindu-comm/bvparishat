Dear Prof Nmboodiri  
  
Kindly permit me to post the whole thing on Bharatiya Vidvat Parishat , so that hundreds of scholars would know / react . There is some context .  
  
To put it in a few words neither Stall nor Max Muller nor Whitney did learn Panini in the way it should be learned .  
  
In the West (presently it started here in India also) people read Panini (mostly translations ) and write a book .  
  
Without the knowledge of Padavaakyapramaan.as'aastras , I fail to understand , as to how one can understand / teach any Sastra .  
  
Most of the time the comments they make are provoking and vouch to their impudence .  
  
'aiun.' - without the knowledge of the Nyayasutram - jaatyaakr,.tivyaktayastu padaartha.h , how can  
one understand as to what Panini meant. The teacher may not initially quote the sutra but later he would explain as to how 'a' etc are to cover 18 akaaras etc..  
  
Similarly , without the knowledge of 'angaangibhaava'(Purvamimamsa) how can one explain  
थे structure of Panini's system - the relation between vidhisutra and samjnaa-paribhasaa-adhikaara-atidesa-niyama sutras ?  
  
It is a million dolor question as to how many sastras did they study in gurukula / who were their gurus / what about their memory power / do they have first hand knowledge of works like Mahabhasyam , Vakyapadiyam , Mnjusaa( things should be on the tip of the tongue) etc.  
  
Why should one compare Panini etc. with some Western scholar ?  
  
Panini was dealing with 1137 Vedic sakhas, Vedangas, Vaidyakam, Darsanas etc. and the spoken language .  
  
He , just like his predecessors , introduced some samjnas , which are purely technical , i.e. have got nothing to do with the language in common parlance (see Manjusa-first part). This is common to all sastras including Mathematics , Ayurveda , Natyasastra etc.  
  
In Modern Linguistics ' Morphology' is a term borrowed from Plant Sciences .  
  
Ekasesa is akin to mathematical calculations .  
  
I have published a book - ' Theories of Language : Oriental & Occidental (2008) and arranged to be sent to America , Canada , Britain and India . I refuted all the Modern Linguistic Theories vis a vis Indian Theories .  
So far I have received only one review from Asiatic Society , Bombay (1904), recently .  
  
For some Panini deals with Morphology , for others Syntax etc. Did they study Panini ?  
  
Astadhyayi deals with Phonology to Discourse Analysis , i.e. Varna to Mahavakya , including semantics .  
  
The comments of Max Muller and Whitney are not worth commenting . It is a waste of time .  
  
I think the following is worthy to note -  
  
विद्वानेव विजनाति विद्वज्जनपरिस्रमम् I  
न हि वन्ध्या विजानाति गुर्वीं प्रसववेदनाम् II  
प्रज्ञा विवेकं लभते भिन्नैरागमदर्शनैः I  
कियद्वा शक्यमुन्नेतुं स्वतर्कमनुधावता ?  
  
dhanyo'smi
