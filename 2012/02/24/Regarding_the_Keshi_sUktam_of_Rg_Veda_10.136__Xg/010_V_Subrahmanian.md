Namaste.  
  
Here this very episode, in the srImadbhAgavatam, has a whole section where the devatAs including Lord Hari Himself, acknowledging that Shiva is the Supreme Brahman:  
  
[SB 8.7: Lord Siva Saves the Universe by Drinking Poison](http://srimad-bhagavatam.com/d.php?g=61619)  
  

This verse and the explanation the Gaudiya Vaishnava Acharya gives, quoting Sri Madhwacharya, is of especial importance to show how to what extent one can go to establish Vishnu pAramya by distorting and twisting the Bhagavata verse:

  

TEXT 19



 

tad ugra-vegaṁ diśi diśy upary adho



visarpad utsarpad asahyam aprati



bhītāḥ prajā dudruvur aṅga seśvarā



arakṣyamāṇāḥ śaraṇaṁ sadāśivam



SYNONYMS



tat—that; ugra-vegam—very fierce and potent poison; diśi diśi—in all directions; upari—upward; adhaḥ—downward; visarpat—curling; utsarpat—going upward; asahyam—unbearable; aprati—uncontrollable; bhītāḥ—being very much afraid; prajāḥ—the residents of all the worlds; dudruvuḥ—moved here and there; aṅga—O Mahārāja Parīkṣit; sa-īśvarāḥ—with the Supreme Lord; arakṣyamāṇāḥ—not being protected; śaraṇam—shelter; sadāśivam—unto the lotus feet of Lord Śiva.





O King, when that uncontrollable poison was forcefully spreading up and down in all directions, all the demigods, along with the Lord Himself, approached Lord Śiva \[Sadāśiva\]. Feeling unsheltered and very much afraid, they sought shelter of him.



(This is the explanation of the Gaudiya Acharya):

  

One may question that since the Supreme Personality of Godhead was personally present, why did He accompany all the demigods and people in general to take shelter of Lord Sadāśiva, instead of intervening Himself. In this connection Śrīla Madhvācārya warns:



rudrasya yaśaso ’rthāya  
svayaṁ viṣṇur viṣaṁ vibhuḥ  
na sañjahre samartho ’pi  
vāyuṁ coce praśāntaye



Lord Viṣṇu was competent to rectify the situation, but in order to give credit to Lord Śiva, who later drank all the poison and kept it in his neck, Lord Viṣṇu did not take action.

  

\[One can also see how this account contradicts the quoted Padma purana uttara khanda verses where it is said Vayu drank 'anAyaasena' and Shiva was given just a drop and how Shiva suffered the effects of the poison and was 'saved' by Vayu and Hari. In order to uphold 'somehow' the Hari-vAyu paaramya poor Shiva is unceremoniously sacrificed!!\]  



  

TEXT 22



 

tvam ekaḥ sarva-jagata



īśvaro bandha-mokṣayoḥ



taṁ tvām arcanti kuśalāḥ



prapannārti-haraṁ gurum



SYNONYMS



tvam ekaḥ—Your Lordship is indeed; sarva-jagataḥ—of the three worlds; īśvaraḥ—the controller; bandha-mokṣayoḥ—of both bondage and liberation; tam—that controller; tvām arcanti—worship you; kuśalāḥ—persons who want good fortune; prapanna-ārti-haram—who can mitigate all the distresses of a sheltered devotee; gurum—you who act as a good advisor to all fallen souls.





O lord, you are the cause of bondage and liberation of the entire universe because you are its ruler. Those who are advanced in spiritual consciousness surrender unto you, and therefore you are the cause of mitigating their distresses, and you are also the cause of their liberation. We therefore worship Your Lordship.





  

TEXT 29



 

mukhāni pañcopaniṣadas taveśa



yais triṁśad-aṣṭottara-mantra-vargaḥ



yat tac chivākhyaṁ paramātma-tattvaṁ



deva svayaṁ-jyotir avasthitis te



SYNONYMS



mukhāni—faces; pañca—five; upaniṣadaḥ—Vedic literatures; tava—your; īśa—O lord; yaiḥ—by which; triṁśat-aṣṭa-uttara-mantra-vargaḥ—in the category of thirty-eight important Vedic mantras; yat—that; tat—as it is; śiva-ākhyam—celebrated by the name Śiva; paramātma-tattvam—which ascertain the truth about Paramātmā; deva—O lord; svayam-jyotiḥ—self-illuminated; avasthitiḥ—situation; te—of Your Lordship.





O lord, the five important Vedic mantras are represented by your five faces, from which the thirty-eight most celebrated Vedic mantras have been generated. Your Lordship, being celebrated as Lord Śiva, is self-illuminated. You are directly situated as the supreme truth, known as Paramātmā.





  

TEXT 31

 

na te giri-trākhila-loka-pāla-



viriñca-vaikuṇṭha-surendra-gamyam



jyotiḥ paraṁ yatra rajas tamaś ca



sattvaṁ na yad brahma nirasta-bhedam



SYNONYMS



na—not; te—of Your Lordship; giri-tra—O King of the mountains; akhila-loka-pāla—all the directors of departments of material activities; viriñca—Lord Brahmā; vaikuṇṭha—Lord Viṣṇu; sura-indra—the King of heaven; gamyam—they can understand; jyotiḥ—effulgence; param—transcendental; yatra—wherein; rajaḥ—the mode of passion; tamaḥ ca—and the mode of ignorance; sattvam—the mode of goodness; na—not; yat brahma—which is impersonal Brahman; nirasta-bhedam—without distinction between demigods and human beings.





O Lord Girīśa, since the impersonal Brahman effulgence is transcendental to the material modes of goodness, passion and ignorance, the various directors of this material world certainly cannot appreciate it or even know where it is. It is not understandable even to Lord Brahmā, Lord Viṣṇu or the King of heaven, Mahendra.

  

The set of verses in the Bhagavatam are there in the section that describes the contents of the Purusha sUkta as applicable to Shiva.  

  

I would also like to add that that there are some progressive thinking people who have realized that there is no validity in distinguishing Hari and Hara. In a Kannada journal 'mukhyaprANa' an article has appeared titled: 'hari-hara bheda salladu'. I did not read it as I could not at that time; I had gone there to that house to buy a copy of Dr.A.V.Nagasampige's very popular Kannada book: mata traya sameekshA.
