ACCEPTED, WELL-KNOWN AND ANCIENT all these terms are relative. I earnestly request the elite scholars not to be offended when a largely accepted tenet is challenged by a school of thought using the sound canons of interpretation by quoting genuine texts. It is highly unbecoming of respected scholars to immediately term that thereveredBhashyakaras have extrapolated the texts and twisted the facts to make their point. Appayya Dikshita is no exception here. Leaving aside the controversialtexts which are challenged as being extrapolated, the said tenets can also be proven with mutually agreeable texts like Bhagvad Gita . This will prove that the in accordance with Gita and other canonical texts, the quoted versions are also genuine and the comments made by some that they are "extrapolated" and "twisted" are proven to be baseless.

  

Also, in the case of Kesi sukta, if Sayana interprets it as "Water" then it is acceptable. If Madhwa, much earlier than Sayana, interprets it as "Halahala Visha" then it is not. Why this bias? Just because some people think that the image of Shiva is degraded? When we approach with an open mind, Madhwa's interpretation is logical and also wins the support of genuine Smriti texts as quoted earlier.

What is wrong in such an interpretation? Narasimha is praised as the indweller of Rudra.

BRAHMAN can be definitely called by the name SIVA. No objections whatsoever. That HE has several forms and names is very well known - यो देवानां नामधा एक एव । But it is very clear from the entire corpus of shruti and puranas that Parvati Pati Shiva is different. He is a soul (very high in stature) , himself a great devotee of the Supreme Brahman, but not the SUPREME BRAHMAN himself.

I don't understand why whomsoever Umaa points to COULD AND NATURALLY BE SIVA? Why not VISHNU?

I am not convinced by this as it is well known that the entire Vedic corpus is of the single opinion that VISHNU-NARAYANA-SIVA-BRAHMAN are the different names of the SUPREME BRAHMAN. HE is ONE. The other demi-gods like four-faced BRAHMAN, RUDRA, INDRA, AGNI are different and they themselves do not agree that they are the SUPREME BRAHMAN.See the statement of Brahma - ओं नमो भगवते वासुदेवाय धीमहि यन्मायया दुर्जयया मां वदन्ति जगद्गुरुम् ।And also of Rudra श्रीराम राम रामेति रमे रामे मनोरमे सहस्रनामतत्तुल्यं राम नाम वरानने ।।

  

Also,

  

यस्मात् क्षरमतीतोहं अक्षरादपि चोत्तमः अतोस्मि लोके वेदे च प्रथितः पुरुषोत्तमः ।

मत्तः परतरं नान्यत् कि़ञ्चिदस्ति धनञ्जय

अस्य देवस्य मीळ्हुषो वया विष्णोरेषस्य प्रभृते हविर्भिः ।

विदे हि रुद्रो रुद्रियं महित्वं यासिष्टं वर्तिरश्विनाविरावत् ।

एको नारायण आसीत् न ब्रह्मा न च शङ्करः ।

यं कामये तं तं मुग्रं कृणोमि तं ब्रह्माणं तं ऋषिं सुमेधां ।

अहं रूद्राय धनरुातनोमि ब्रह्मद्विषो शरवे हन्त वा उ ।

  

इत्यादि सर्वसम्मतबहुविधश्रुतिस्मृतिपुराणैश्च नारायणः एव ब्रह्म इत्यवगम्यते ।

Same here. Hope this post will be taken in true spirit as well.
