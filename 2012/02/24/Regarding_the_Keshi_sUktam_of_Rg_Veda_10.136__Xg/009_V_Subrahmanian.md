Namaste.  
  
It is not a question of bias. The interpretation as ’Halahala viSha' is fraught with many contradictions. The Bhagavata purana does not speak anything about vAyu in that episode. It fully portrays Shiva as the saviour of the day. But the Padmapurana gives a different story altogether. While Shiva is regarded as nIlakanTha after this episode, there is no such prasiddhi for vAyu for even he is said to have imbibed the poison. In fact from the 'truth' that vAyu alone drank the undiluted/unrefined poison, he should have been called nilakanTha. But we can always say that it was Vishnu's samkalpa that Shiva should get that praise!!  
  
Apart from that the theory that vAyu destroyed its potential (asta-bala) and then gave it to Shiva smacks of simple defaming/trickery. Someone who has read the Bhagavatam episode alone might develop genuine Bhakti for Shiva. \[For, Sri Madhwachaarya says 'even though Vishnu was Himself capable of destroying the poison He allowed Shiva to do it (through Vayu) to give Shiva the 'credit'.\] Now what is the need to give Shiva the credit if only Vishnu's intention was to generate bhakti in a person who knows about this sAhasa of Shiva? But then we have the Padmapurana giving a different turn to the episode by giving the credit to vAyu. Now, the one who had read the Bhagavatam and developed genuine bhakti for Shiva is confused and now discredits Shiva of the sAhasa involved. For he comes to know that 'after all Shiva has only consumed the watered down version of the poison and what is so great about it?'.
And the Padmapurana dialogue between Shiva and Parvati says 'Shiva's
very life was saved by Vayu and Vishnu.' A person who had to depend on others for saving his own life, is praised as the jagadrakShaka in the Bhagavatam !! Now, we see the ulterior motive involved here. The first 'giving credit to Shiva' by Vishnu is finally aimed at getting the credit for Himself and vAyu. What is all this?

I have heard that there is a 'viShNupara' commentary of the Sri Rudra prashna of the Taittiriya samhitA by an Acharya of the Madhwa school.
No one should get praise/credit other than Vishnu. That is the ultimate motive.

I am also reminded of another verse of the SrimadbhAgavatam in the context of Daksha yagna:

श्रीभगवानुवाच

अहं ब्रह्मा च शर्वश्च जगतः कारणं परम् ।

आत्मेश्वर उपद्रष्टा स्वयंदृगविशेषणः ॥५०॥

आत्ममायां समाविश्य सोऽहं गुणमयीं द्विज ।

सृजन् रक्षन् हरन् विश्वं दध्रे संज्ञां क्रियोचिताम् ॥५१॥

\[Brahmaa - sRiShTi, VishNu - sthitiH, Shiva - samhAra\]  

तस्मिन् ब्रह्मण्यद्वितीये केवले परमात्मनि ।

ब्रह्मारुद्रौ च भूतानि भेदेनाज्ञोऽनुपश्यति ॥५२॥

यथा पुमान्न स्वाङ्गेषु शिरःपाण्यदिषु क्वचित् ।

पारक्यबुद्धिं कुरुते एवं भूतेषु मत्परः ॥५३॥

*त्रयाणामेकभावानां यो न पश्यति वै भिदाम् ।*

*सर्वभूतात्मनां ब्रह्मन् स शान्तिमधिगच्छति ॥५४॥*

  
(IV.7.50 – 54)

(50) *Lord Vishnu said: 'I, Brahmâ and Lord S'iva as well, do not differ in being the supreme cause and Supersoul, the witness and the self-sufficient one of the material manifestation.* *Him the Supreme Brahmân that is without a second, is as one Supersoul with both Brahmâ and S'iva, but the living ones who are not conversant with this, think of them as being separate.* (53) The way a person sometimes does not make a difference between the head, hands and other parts of his own body, so does My devotee thus make no difference between living beings. *(54) He who having the one nature of the Three, verily does, of the Supersoul in all beings, not see the separateness, o brahmin, realizes the peace.'*

But Vishnu Himself says:  

अहं ब्रह्मा च शर्वश्च जगतः कारणं परम् ।

आत्मेश्वर उपद्रष्टा स्वयंदृगविशेषणः ॥५०॥

आत्ममायां समाविश्य सोऽहं गुणमयीं द्विज ।

\[Brahmaa - sRiShTi, VishNu - sthitiH, Shiva - samhAra\]

  

Here is a quote from the book: 'Sri Appayya Dikshita' (p.66,67) by Dr.N.Ramesan, IAS. He has not mentioned the particular text where this verse appears. It is quite possible that it was a stray verse of Appayya Dikshita. In many places Dr.Ramesan gives the source too while quoting a single verse or many verses of Dikshita in that book.   
  
The verse, in full, and its meaning:  
// viShNurvA shankaro vA shruti-shikhara-girAmastu tAtparya-bhUmiH  
na-asmAkam tatra vAdaH prasarati kimapi spaShTam-advaita-bhAjAm \|  
kintu-Isha-dveSha-gADhAnala-kalita-hRRidAm durmatInAm duruktIH

bhanktum yatno mama-ayam nahi bhavatu tato viShNu-vidveSha-shankAm \|\|  

  
The meaning of the above beautiful verse is:  
  
'I have not the slightest objection, to anyone coming to any  
conclusion, that the spirit of the Vedas and the Vedantas, declare  
either Vishnu or Shiva as the First God. I am a follower of the  
Advaita doctrine. I have no difference between Shiva and VishNu.  
But if in order to establish Vishnu as the main God, if somebody  
starts abusing Shiva or hates him, I cannot bear it. There are as  
many proofs or pramanas in the Vedas, Vedantas, Puranas and Agamas to establish that Shiva is a mighty God, as there are to prove that Vishnu is a powerful one. However, I am propagating my religion and indulging in debate and disputation, only to persuade everyone not to hate Shiva. Let no one have the slightest doubt that I either hate or wish to denigrate Lord Vishnu simply because I praise the grace and greatness of Lord Shiva.'  
  
The sublime devotion of Dikshita to Lord Vishnu is fully seen from  
his great work 'Varadaraja stava' where he has sung in ecstatic  
poetry about Lord Varadaraja of Kanchipuram. Vaishnavas declare that Vishnu is the supreme being and that Shiva has a lower status being mere jiva. Sri Dikshita however proves in his 'Ratna-traya- parIkShA' that Shiva, Vishnu, Ambika, all the three are the same, viz., the supreme reality, and proves it with the pramanas taken from the puranas, vedas and agamas. //  
  
The above is quoted from the book: 'Sri Appayya Dikshita' (p.66,67) by Dr.N.Ramesan, IAS.  
  
Let us leave this kind of 'who is greater/greatest' vAda in the spirit of:  
शिवाय विष्णुरूपाय शिवरूपाय विष्णवे ।  
शिवस्य हृदयं विष्णुर्विष्णोश्च हृदयं शिवः ॥  
  
This shloka is recited by many people of the smArta sampradaya in Karnataka during their sandhyavandana.  
  
For endlessly we can keep showing instances of Vishnu/Rama/Krishna worshiping Shiva from Mahabharta and other works. Again all these episodes can be given a different meaning upholding the pAramya of Vishnu. With the strength of tarka and vyAkaraNa anyone can argue in one's favour. There is no 'pratiShThA' for this (तर्कस्य अप्रतिष्ठानात्).
