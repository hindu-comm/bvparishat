Namaste.  
There is discssion verily on this point. By the Veda-s the Upanishads are also naturally included, and there are many passages in them that teach one or the other form the supreme God as the highest reality, Brahma.  
And the maxim "bhuuyasaa vyapade\~saH" is naturally weighty and there are arguments to prove one particular Godhead as the Brahma.  
One supreme reality manifesting as THREE is not so much found in many of the Upani.sad-s.  
Thanks  
Ganesan
