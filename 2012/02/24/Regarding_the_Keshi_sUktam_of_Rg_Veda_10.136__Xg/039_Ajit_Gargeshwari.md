Sri Krishnamurthy,  
This is not Shankra's interpretation of Upanishads. I didn't find any such interpretation in Shankara's bhashya on upanishads. This sounds more like your interpretation from popular books written on the subject or your understanding. Reading his bhashyas either in translation or orginal might help you to correctly interpret Shankara and not misrepresent his grand and sublime philosophy.  
  
Regards  
Ajit Gargeshwari
