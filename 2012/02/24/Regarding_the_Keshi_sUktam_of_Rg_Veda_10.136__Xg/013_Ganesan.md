No one should get praise/credit other than Vishnu. That is the ultimate motive".  
  

Very correct observation indeed on the motive of these commentators .  
  
One finds in all these the logic and context of the text cited or commented are given a complete go by and text torturing to the best possibility is resorted to unhindered.  
  
NiilakanTa diikshita very succinctly says in his introductory portion of his commentary Sivatattvaviveka on the SIVAASHTOTTARASATANAAMASTOTRA, after summarising the views of the opponents who condemn all the Saiva purana-s as Taamasa thus:  
 न हि परेण भ्रान्तमिति स्वेनापि भ्रमितव्यम् ।
