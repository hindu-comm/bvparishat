> A very good reference and a reasonable argument indeed !  

I would like to add that this need not be interpreted as an argument to show that Suka Maharshi is convinced of Hari-Hara sAmyam. He is just citing two instances involving Hari and Hara each, to teach Pariikshit (and through him to others) that any misadventure 'imitating' these peculiar acts by lesser mortals would lead them to destruction.  
There is also this subtle difference in these two acts referred:  
While there is 'dharmavyatikrama' in the act of "touching the wives of others" by Hari, there is absolutely no such transgression in the act of drinking the terrific poison by Hara. For, Siva accepts to drink the cruel poison to save the entire universe from destruction upon the prayers from the gods.  
The ancient Sivamahimnastava clearly puts it s follows:  
  अकाण्ड-ब्रह्माण्ड-क्षयचकित-देवासुरकृपा

 विधेयस्याऽऽसीद्‌यस्त्रिनयन विषं संहृतवतः।

 स कल्माषः कण्ठे तव न कुरुते न श्रियमहो

 विकारोऽपि श्लाघ्यो भुवन-भय- भङ्ग- व्यसनिनः॥   
  
The above mentioned reference is only a sample. There are more such references in the PurANa-s.  
Therefore the act of drinking poison is out of "bhuvana-bhaya-bhanga-vyasana" which stands altogether in a different level and due to which there is change of colour in Siva's throat. This very act has earned Him the immortal name tyaagaraaja.  
Ganesan
