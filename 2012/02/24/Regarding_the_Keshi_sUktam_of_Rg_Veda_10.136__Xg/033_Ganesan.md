You seem to ingeniously extrapolate the views which Samkara has never said; he insists in all his commentaries on the 'superimposed nature'
--adhyasta--of the phenomenal world on Brahma. Nowhere he has said that **mithya** means only ***derivative, effect*** as you say.  
Everywhere in his commentaries, and especially in aarambha.naadhikara.nam (tadananyatvam [aarambha.na](http://aarambha.na)\~sabdaadibhya.h, etc.) he never misses an opportunity to insist on the 'mithyaatva' of the effect.  
  
That the phenomenal world is a manifestation of the supreme reality in all Its splendour and variety which bespeaks the inexhaustible power (shakti) of that supreme Reality --Parama\~siva--was the bold declaration of the Saiva Agama-s and following them the Saivasiddhanta and the Pratyabhij\~naa systems whose greatest representative is Abhinavagupta.  
See the one of the ma\~Ngala\~sloka-s of the Sriika.n.tha's bhaa.sya on the Brahmasuutra:  
   निजशक्तिभित्तिनिर्मितजगज्जालचित्रनिकुरुम्बः ।  
   
If Samkara had said so as you read these views on him, there would not have been so much of philosophical debates all these centuries!!! by which of course, we are all benefited !!  
Thanks
