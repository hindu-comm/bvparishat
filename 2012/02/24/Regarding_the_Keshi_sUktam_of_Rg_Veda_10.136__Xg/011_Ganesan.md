It is true. But again, it looks so strange that one is 'advised' to avoid such discussions; but, when......??? Initially one starts such thread,,, and when there comes a reply with more support presenting the case for Siva,,,,, suddenly it is 'advised' to put an end to these discussions involving greatness of either Siva or Vishnu.  
Either one discusses, puts forth arguments,, (of course objectively) and there ensues a lively discussion. Or, never start such a discussion at all !!!.  
Whether one likes it or not, there are sizable quantity of texts on this vry important point.  
Also, one has to have a historical view of developments of such ideas.  
But to stop such discussions when matters from the Saiva view point are put forth, does not look objective or neutrality.  
With the best wishes  
Ganesan
