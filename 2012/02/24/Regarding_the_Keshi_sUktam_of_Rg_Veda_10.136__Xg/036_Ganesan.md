Dear Krishnamurhy,  
It is not mine or your **prerogative** to accept the Saivagama views. What I insist is that there are much better explanations of world evolution in the Saiva Agama-s; they are far better and highly realistic doctrines based directly on our experience--the doctrine of 36 tattva-s (not 21 tattva-s as said by you, no Agama speaks of 21 tattva-s) than the pa\~[nciikara.na](http://nciikara.na). Just as you say many ancient Vedic commentators had missed scientific truths in their explanations, I can also say that you are missing these truths which are available in the Saiva Agama-s.  
  
One should come out of the 'closed circle' of Vedanta (the blinkers, to adopt your own words !!) and have a nice view of the other side of grand doctrines expounded in the Saiva Agama-s and the Saiva philosophical systems such as Saivasiddhanta and the Pratyabhijnaa schools which have a long history.  
  
The world-- the variety--that we confront and the numberless manifesttaions--are all but the manifestations of supreme store house of power, parama\~siva. Possessed of unlimited power of knowledge and action--d.rkkriyaa\~sakti, He cannot have an inert "Sakti'--jaDaruupa--nor His creations--the world--a mithyaa or an unreal inert manifestation.  
Now, neither this view nor as you say, that the world is the 'body' of Brahma--has never been said by Samkara at all.  
That is my point. If what you say is true, then, why should it be said "brahma satyam, jaganmithyaa" ? It is enough to say, "brahma satyam".  
You seem to read the views expounded in the Saiva pratyabhijnaa system--into Samkara.  
What you say as scientific view was not uttered by Samkara. Just accepting that fact is enough.  
  
Next, to revert to the earlier thread on [vaalmiikiraamaaya.na](http://vaalmiikiraamaaya.na):  
You say that vaalmiiki has written [raamaaya.na](http://raamaaya.na) as a [vedopab.rMha.na](http://vedopab.rMha.na) and that it is a dar\~sanakaavya.  
Then what about Kaalidaasa, the greatest of our poets ?  
He very excellently summarises the Vedaanta in the naandii\~sloka of his naa.taka (Vikramorva\~siiyam):  
 वेदान्तेषु यमाहुरेकपुरुषं व्याप्य स्थितं रोदसी  
 यस्मिन्नीश्वर इत्यनन्यविषयः शब्दो यथार्थाक्षरः । . .  
'The supreme unique reality, the [PURU.SA](http://PURU.SA) expounded in the Vedaanta, who had pervaded the earth and the celestial regions, for whom the epithet 'ii\~svara' is highly apt and DOES NOT APPLY TO ANY OTHER DEITY (ananyavi.saya).. So therefore, in the words of Kaalidaasa, the vedaanta considers that Brahma is not an unqualified nor a nameless-formless-qualityless one (naamaruupavihiina, or nirvi\~[se.sa](http://se.sa)).  
Note the usage of the word [PURU.SA](http://PURU.SA) and ii\~svara by him to denote Brahma.  
Then the naandii\~sloka of the Abhij\~naana\~saakuntalam:  
 या सृष्टिः स्रष्टुराद्या वहति विधिहुतं या हविर्या च होत्री  
 ये द्वे कालं विधत्तः श्रुतिविषयगुणा या स्थिता व्याप्य विश्वम् ।  
  . . . . .............  
 प्रत्यक्षाभिः प्रपन्नस्तनुभिरवतु वस्ताभिरष्टाभिरीशः ।।  
This concept of a.s.tamuurtitva of Siva is an old Vedic view and according to it, the entire universe--the five elements, the sun, moon and the individual self (yajamaana) are all different forms (muurti) of Siva. Here there is nothing that is 'mithyaa' nor unreal or illusory.  
Nowhere does it mean the [kaara.na](http://kaara.na) alone is real and the effects are unreal or superimposed.  
Why this view is not at all stated or referred by Samkara ?  
This in fact, is a pre-Samkara view, very often found referred in the Veda-s especially in the braahma.na-s and the Lingapuraa.na.  
Kaalidaasa, definitely living long, long before Samkara, has clearly stated that this view is the Vedaanta of his times--Puru.sa is Brahma is Isvara. The entire world is His manifestation or different forms of Him. He is a.s.tamuurti. If vaalmiiki is a dar\~sanakavi, definitely Kaalidaasa is also one. Probably a much better one giving the quintessence of Vedaanta in a nutshell of a poetry !!  
Nowhere is Samkara near this view.  
  
Shall we say that Samkara has given a turn (twist ????) to the early- existing views according to which Siva is Brahma ? He made Brahma [nirgu.na](http://nirgu.na) by giving a one-sided interpretation completely overlooking this ancient view ? That \~Sivaadvaita was the earliest standpoint of Vedaanta without any room for 'mithyaatva' of the world which Samkara has changed ?? It may also be said that he had gone one step further and gave a vaishnava tinge by stating (in the Bhagavadgiitabhaa.sya), "k.r.s.nastu bhagavaan svayam" and more than once citing the example of the \~saalagraama than a baa.nali\~Nga which is also equally appropriate in the place where he cites the example of \~saalagraama. For which, I may quip, later vaishnava vedaanta acharya-s should be indebted to him for showing them the path !!!!!  
That this interpretation of Samkara is not my own view is fully supported by a very early reference to Vedaanta in one of the7th- 8th century Bauddha texts composed by a Bauddha teacher, by name Bhavya. (I do not remember he name of the text which I will give in my next mail) In this text Bhavya says that the Vedaantavaadii-s call Brahma by various names such as Isvara, Puru.sa, etc. Note that he never says that Vedaantavaada considers the manifested world 'mithyaa' ... nor Brahma a [nirgu.na](http://nirgu.na) and nirvi\~[se.sa](http://se.sa).  
I think I have made some points clear.  
Thanking you  
Ganesan
