This leads to an important point: We have been seeing many such explanations  
guised as commentaries written in Sanskrit. Many ACCEPTED, WELL-KNOWN AND  
ANCIENT stories regarding Siva (Rudra)and applicable only to Siva, that are  
scattered in the Veda-s, Brahmana-s and even Upanishads are twisted by such  
"commentators" and explained mostly as pertaining to Vishnu or to other gods as  
in the present case.  
Some years back I have seen a PUBLISHED Sanskrit commentary on the well-known  
mantra-s of the Taittiriiya aaraNyaka such as the ones that begin with ईशानः  
सर्वविद्यानां, . . . सद्योजातं प्रपद्यामि . . . .The commentator (a svami  
belonging to the Maadhva sampradaaya) completely changes the meaning of these  
mantra-s and explains सद्योजातं in a weird and totally ridiculous way as  
applying to Narasimha; SADYOJAATA= You, who have come out in an instant from the  
pillar upon Prahlaada's prayer".

The instance of Svetasvataropanishad is a strong case in this point:  
The entire Upanishad is permeated with supreme devotion to Siva (= Rudra)and  
from the beginnig establishes Rudra as the highest Brahma; the last verse  
यदा चर्मवदाकाशं वेष्टयिष्यन्ति मानवाः ।  
तदा देवमविज्ञाय दुःखस्यान्तो भविष्यति ।  
Here Srikantha accepts the reading "शिवमविज्ञाय" in place of देवमविज्ञाय. But  
such a 'changing' of the text seems to have taken place earlier.  
The previous verse is  
यो ब्रह्माणं विदधाति पूर्वं यो वै वेदांश्च प्रहिणोति तस्मै ।  
तँ ह देवमात्मबुद्धिप्रकाशं मुमुक्षुर्वै शऱणमहं प्रपद्ये ।  
Therefore , by context, Deva applies naturally to Siva in this text and  
therefore, Brahma = Siva.  
Here either the fact of applying to Siva alone is either not stressed or,  
explained away as if not important. For corroboration one may cite the stry of  
the Kenopanishad where Umaa, HaimavatI appears before Agni, Vaayu, Indra and  
shows to them that the "unknown Yaksha' that appeared before them is the Highest  
Brahma by whose power these Gods get their share of powers. Now, the Brahma  
shown by Umaa-HaimavatI COULD AND NATURALLY BE SIVA alone and none else. One  
should note the usage of names as Umaa, and to be without any doubt, HaimavatI.  
Umaa-haimavatI cannot show any other reality as the Highest Brahma. I am very  
much sure that an objective minded scholar will definitely agree. But,  
interestingly beginning from Samkara none of them underlined this fundamental  
point.  
I am citing these instances to show that 'Brahma' can be applicable only to Siva.  
The Smriti corroboration  
अष्टादशानामेतासां भिन्नवर्त्मनाम् ।  
आदिकर्ता कविः साक्षात् शूलपाणिरिति स्थितिः ।

clearly states that SuulapANi Siva is the author of all the 18 streams of  
scriptures beginning from .Veda

  
My point is by having a complete look of the entire Vedic, (including the  
Upanishadic) corpus , it is absolutely clear that Brahma = Siva and that is the  
burden of the Svetasvataropanishad, etc.

  
In fact this has been going on since quite long as stated many times by  
AppayadIkShita,  
NiilakaNThadIkshita, in many of their texts.  
Another instance is in the commentary called 'Tilaka' composed by Govindaraja  
belonging to the 16th century. While commenting the story of Rama's breaking the  
Sivadhanus, he writes that it is symbolic of Rama destroying the Saivadharma (  
as Dhanus also means Dharma; sivadhanus = sivadharma)and establishing the  
superiority of Vaishnava dharma. Such is the extent of antagonism,  
text-torturing trend of many of these traditional commentators.

Mypoint is to state the points clear without offending anybody's sensibilities.
