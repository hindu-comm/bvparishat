In the Valmiki Ramayana, araNya kANDa, we have this verse as coming from Mother Seetha to Ravana when he comes to abduct Her:  

  
mandaraM parvataSreshTham pANinA hartum ichhasi \|  
kAlakUTaM vishaM pItvA svastimAn gantum icchasi \|\| (araNya kANDa, 47.40)  
  
"You wish to take away the mandara mountain by hand? You wish to walk away  
unharmed after consuming poison?" The reference here is to the kUrmAvatAra  
when Siva drank the kAlakUTa poison while vishNu supported mandara.  
  
Here we see two extraordinary events - one where VishNu took an avatAra and the other where Shiva displayed a sAhasa - are alluded to which speaks of the intention of Valmiki to equate Vishnu and Shiva.  
  
None of the available commentaries elaborate on the above verse.
