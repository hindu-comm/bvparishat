We the scholars of the परिषत् better avoid engaging such disputes as the शिव and वैष्णव writers did in the past. This was meant by Ramkaran Sharma, and due to the recent change in reply system, it was posted directly to Ganeshan, which was intended to all the scholars in the "parishat" as earlier. Hope this was not intended towards respected Ganesan only and was done without noticing the change in the reply button by Raam Karan Sarma.

Dear scholars,  
Of course it is agreed that there should be unbiased discussion on these points.  
But why should one **stop continuing the discussion in this direction** ?????  
  
But this "parishad" is the forum and this is the occasion for dicussing these 'important' points.  
we need not shy away from putting forth one's views, understanding of views and the vast reference materials in this regard.  
One thing we should bear in mind is that we are not "deciding" whether this God is superior over others; what we are doing is citing various views, the support or refutation of them by others so that scholarly world knows them.  
For all said and done, none of us is a "naiyaayika" or a "miimaaMsaka" but we all identify with one system of religio-philosophy or the various schools of Vedanta or the other. That means, those who are intereted amongst us have studied and are studying many texts, commentaries by various authors in this regard. In this forum we share those views. It cannot be mere reporting the views and naturally it will involve discussions passing remarks for and against one or many views/comentators.  
Now because of this discussion many of us come to know the episode of Vaayu drinking poison, etc. and how there ensued various view points in the tradition, how there are "different" commentaries ,some even very recent, on the Veda-s and Upanishads, and even we come to know the "text torturing ability" of some traditional commentators.  
  
Just because somebody does not like this, or some will angrily remark, that one should desisit us from putting forth the views.  
After all, discussions on these matters is directly involved with one's beliefs and knowledge.  
So, I feel that instead of merely discussing "dry" Naiyaayika topics such AnupaanapramANa, Vyaapti, Pakshadharmataa, Hetvaabhaasa, alone scholars in this forum should participate in these discussions. Of course those who do not want to openly state and take sides (but in their heart of hearts many cannot avoid taking sides,,,!!!!) may avoid participating. But it need be a rule for others who are interested, to stop continuing the discussion as opined by H. N. Bhatt.  
That may not be a "scholarly" view.  
Ganesan
