Dear Scholars,



Much Ado is created about nothing.

THAT which existed Before the creation, is called in the Upanishats as Isha, Brahma or Parameshwara or parabrahma. And THAT alone *tredhaa nidadhe padam* \[That took up the management of this universe in three ways. Rik.1-164 describes how THAT manifest himself in three ways.

"The Sukta:

AxrÉ uÉÉqÉxrÉ mÉÍsÉiÉxrÉ WûÉåiÉÑxiÉxrÉ pÉëÉiÉÉ qÉkrÉqÉÉå AxirÉzlÉÈ \|

iÉÚiÉÏrÉÉå pÉëÉiÉÉ bÉ×iÉmÉ×¸Éå AxrÉÉ§ÉÉmÉzrÉÇ ÌuÉzmÉÌiÉÇ xÉmiÉmÉÑ§ÉqÉç \|\|1

\[I saw the master of this universe, (in the form of) the three Shining bodies, (placed above

one another), the top one creating the universe, the central one wielding everywhere,

protecting, and the third at the bottom, a veritable storehouse of highly condensed life-energy.

The master is known to have seven sons.\]

It is clear from the above that the Master is one, but presents himself here as three bodies.

The word *Bhratha* is interpreted as brother. But it is a gerund from the root ‘tu bhrajru’

(deeptau).

Here, the Rishi explains the birth of the Universe. At the centre, the three (brothers / stars) are

seen one above the other; the one at the top as *Hota*, which word Sayana misinterprets as

*Aadaata*. Actually, *hota* is one who sacrifices, and therefore is the donor. How can he become

the receiver? Yet Sayana takes him to be the receiver. The middle one, who radiates to each

and every nook and corner of the universe, is again mistaken as one who devours everything.

The third is the storehouse of energy. But the Rishi declares that he *saw* in the three *the*

*Master of the Universe*. This is the importance of this Sukta.

It is patent from the puranas that it is this trinity that they refer to; as Vishnu, Brahman and

Maheshwara. Vishnu provides as donor, the rajas, the material for the formation of all the

bodies in the Universe; Brahman at the center, naabhi, is the light that radiates throughout and

empowers our intellect; and Maheshwara supplies the Life energy of which he is shown as

the storehouse. The puranas describe that the Brahman was born at the nabhi of Vishnu. I

have already shown in Adityahrudaya, how what we pray for, the bhargaH is actually a triad;

and that it is derived from the center of this Universe; the khachakra called the Sudarshana.

Further the Yajurveda 5-15 also confirms this: *thredha nidadhe padam* (see page 58). The

God occupied the position: how? In three ways. As supplier of the material, of the intellect

and of the life-energy. The puranas describe the universe as a sea, the axis of which is

constituted by an isle called Rathnadweepa. The axis is described as *sumeru*. So this mantra

describes the beginning of the Universe; which the God managed in three ways as above;

which are famous and need no further explanation. ***Aham apashyam*** signifies that the

Immanifest became Manifest to the Rishi."

These are the excerpts from my book. It is the Vedic exposition. Since Vedas override all Puranas; and commentaries thereon, and hold that HE himself manifested in three ways to manage the Universe and further all the THREE but constitute only One; there is point in our arguing whether Shiva is Superior or Vishnu; when the so-called three \[including the third Brahma\] are but ONE. The first one is called the Head \[vamaH - vishnu [acc.to](http://acc.to) Puranaas\], the middle one the AshnaH \[Brahmaa [acc.to](http://acc.to) puranaas\] and third GhritaprishtaH \[Mahadeva [acc.to](http://acc.to) puraanaas\]. The three together manage the Universe. The very fact that the first is referred to as Shirshaa and the third as PrishTha is to show that they constitute one body. So when they are ONE [acc.to](http://acc.to) Vedas; there is no question of anybody equating them; since that would amount to saying that they are two different entities; which is not correct; Vedas being the final authority.



Discussion per se is not bad and needs to be encouraged, in an assembly of scholars, who are not biassed and are open to Truth. Those who do not want to accept Truth, are free not to accpt the Truth. But if open debate is suppressed those who want to know the Truth will be deprived of the opportunity of knowing the Truth. Scholars can always verify the source quoted and ascertain the TRUTH.
