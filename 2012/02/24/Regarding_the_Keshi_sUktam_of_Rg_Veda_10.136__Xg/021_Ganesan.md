Namste  
Two different 'great' events performed by two deities are referred here  
by Vaalmiiki; but, what is that 'extra ordinary' logic which proves that  
Vaalmiiki thereby intends that the two Gods are equal ? There may be  
other passages where Vaalmiiki intends so, but definitely not the  
passage referred above.  
Moreover, 'saahasa' is mostly used in the sense of rashness, triviality,  
unthought-of actions, etc. as explained in the Dictionary. Therefore,  
drinking the kaalakuuTa poison does not definitely come undr any of  
these meanings.  
We also come across in the commentaries on \~saastra texts that when the  
opponent's theory or argument is logically not sound or does not carry  
any weight, it is dismissed as साहसमात्रम् .  
Therefore, it is not at all logically correct or meaningful to refer to  
the drinking of kAlakuuTa as 'saahasa' as explained by me in my earlier  
response.  
Ganesan
