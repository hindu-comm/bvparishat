Better than pa\~nchiikarana, the Saiva Agama-s offer a very sound and a realistic explanation of the world creation or the world evolution. One can definitely say that the 36 tattva-s propounded for the first time by the Saiva Agama-s completely exhaust all the explanations of the jagats.r.s.ti.  
  
But please beware that for Samkara the world is ultimately an illusory creation and as he himself has said in his Brahmasuutrabhaashya (most probably in the first adhyaaya), that it is not the advaitavaadi's concern whether the world was created from this or that elment; ultimately it is 'mithyaa'. He himself does not accord any great importance or value to cosmological theories.  
  
Your explanation about Consciousness and the cosmography seem to be oversimplified and such explanations as Vishnu and Siva as bipolar, etc. may not be of any help in the aadhyaatmika sphere, which is THE FUNDAMENTAL THEME of all these scriptures (to be distinguished from science books).  
  
Thanks  
Ganesan
