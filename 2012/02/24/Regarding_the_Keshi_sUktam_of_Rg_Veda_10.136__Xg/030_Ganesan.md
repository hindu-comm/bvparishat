Dear Sri krishnamurthy,  
I never mean or understand that Vishnu or Siva are some supermen as you say about my understanding.  
Far from it !!!!  
Even none of the Purana-s do not at all portary in that manner. Probably you have some basic misconceptions about the Purana-s.  
  
Regarding your interpretation of the Rik. 1-164:  
You write  

"The pity is that because the commentators were not conversant with the science subject; they relegated the Rik as a mere parjanya mantra; which is not what is depicted. If you are a student of science, study the Sukta, without recourse to the commentaries that mislead you. You will start wondering at the Cosmic revelations".  

But, you say in the same breath regarding the vaalmiikiraamaayaNa that  
"All the traditional scholars have held to be a Darshana-kavya, ....."  
I am sure that by 'traditionalists' you mean the commentators on the vaalmiikiraamayaNa.  
  
So, you seem to contradict your own statement: For understanding the Rik mantra-s you suggest that it should be studied without recourse to commentaries (as according to you, they have not correctly explained it) while, you say that the vaalmiikiraamaayaNa should be taken as a 'darshanakAvya' as held by the commentators (the traditionalists) !!!!
