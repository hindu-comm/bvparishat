Namaste.  
  
While trying to understand the Keshi suktam of the Rg Veda 10.136 I consulted the Sayana Bhashya. I have attached the portion of the bhashyam for the perusal of the learned scholars here. I also looked into the Griffith's translation which I have provided below:  
  
  
\[10-136\] HYMN CXXXVI. Kesins.  
1. HE with the long loose locks supports Agni, and moisture, heaven, and earth:  
He is all sky to look upon: he with long hair is called this light.  
2 The Munis, girdled with the wind, wear garments soiled of yellow hue.  
They, following the wind's swift course go where the Gods have gone before.  
3 Transported with our Munihood we have pressed on into the winds:  
You therefore, mortal men. behold our natural bodies and no more.  
4 The Muni, made associate in the holy work of every God,  
Looking upon all varied forms flies through the region of the air.  
5 The Steed of Vata, Vayu's friend, the Muni, by the Gods impelled,  
In both the oceans hath his home, in eastern and in western sea.  
6 Treading the path of sylvan beasts, Gandharvas, and Apsarases,  
He with long locks, who knows the wish, is a sweet most delightful friend  
7 Vayu hath churned for him: for him he poundeth things most hard to bend,  
When he with long loose locks hath drunk, with Rudra, water from the cup.  
  
I am unable to make out the context of this sUktam. Who is the main Deity that is spoken of here - VAyu? There is a word 'Light'. Does that indicate vAyu alone? Also, there is a word 'viSham' in the sUktam occurring more than once. Sayana translates it as 'water'. The amara kosha too gives this meaning. What is to be understood from the last verse quoted above? What did vAyu do to the water and why? Why is Rudra said to be drinking the water along with vAyu? Is Rudra the popular Deity Shiva?  
  
Has this sUkta any bearing on the 'amRta mathanam' episode of the srImadbhAgavatam where Shiva is said to have imbibed the kAlakOTa viSha? Does the bhAgavatam make a mention of the contents of the above sUktam in this episode?  
  
The sAyaNa bhashya for this last verse contains a grammar explanation which I am unable to understand. I humbly request the Scholars here to kindly explain the entire sUkta with reference to the questions I have enumerated above.  
  
The attachment contains the sAyana Bhashya. One can increase the size of the images to get clarity. ONLY The first four images are relevant to this sUkta. The rest are about the next sUkta on which I have no questions.  
  
Scholars can feel free to give their reply in Sanskrit if they find that more convenient.  
  
With humble pranams,
