Just like the message sent by me earlier, without taking care to select the proper option, the message of Ram Karan Sharma was also directed to Sri Ganesh. Hence I am forwarding the same message for perusal by all the members of bvp.

  

I apologize for my inadvertance.

There is nothing to wonder if a शैव writer upholds शिव as the Supreme Deity or Parabrahma, and if a वैष्णव writer does the same honor to विष्णु against any offending comments defending him as the same position. Only it will be a wonder, if the reverse is the case. It has been the history of Indian Philosophy witnessed fact of such things whereby the controversy over dvaita and advaita writers in succession, produced a series of works on both sides in defense and offence of the other opponent view.

  

But as researchers, we should not get biased

with such things, such as being degraded or upgraded by the commentators or writers. पुराण-s are also classified according to the predominance of the three deities, ब्रह्म, विष्णु and शिव. By this classification, पद्मपुराण falls into the वैष्णव category and for the reading of the episode of विषमथन into the सूक्त, the change was made retaining the वायु mentioned in the sUkta, as acting upon the inspiration of विष्णु, which is only expected of it. Sri Acarya has reported it as it had been asked for by Sri Subrahmanyam, whether it could not be taken as such. केशिन् - could be conveniently interpreted as कपर्दिन् for the sake of reading the Puranic episode. This fact was reported by Jayatirtha, to support the interpretation of Madhvacarya. This is in reply to the question what वायु has to do in the episode which is not available in other पुराण-s and वायु has a special position as जीवोत्तम or मुख्यप्राण in माध्व system which may or ,may not be accepted by the non-madhva writer or commentator.  



It is the same with शाक्त पुराण-s, also, of which Sri Sankara, makes the supremacy of शक्ति over other deities. The purpose does not seem to degrade the other deity, but upholding his favorite deity praised at the cost of others. The same episode tis taken as the power of the ताटाङ्क of देवि, हरमहिषि. that he outlived in spite of drinking poison. This is also need not be interpreted as the derogation towards शिव, but only in praise of the शक्ति.

  

We the scholars of the परिषत् better avoid engaging such disputes as the शिव and वैष्णव writers did in the past. This was meant by Ramkaran Sharma, and due to the recent change in reply system, it was posted directly to Ganeshan, which was intended to all the scholars in the "parishat" as earlier. Hope this was not intended towards respected Ganesan only and was done without noticing the change in the reply button by Raam Karan Sarma.

  

Hope now we can stop continuing the discussion in this direction as the query raised in the original post was answered satisfactorily.

  

This is not the only case, taking the words to suit our purpose. The popular Rik, गणानां त्वा गणपतिं is taken as the invocation आवाहनमत्र for गणपति a शैव or शाक्त deity, whereas in fact, the address itself ब्रह्मणस्पति the deity of the सुक्त according to देवतानुक्रमणी, has nothing to do with the गणपति the son of शिव, the elephant faced deity of the पुराण-s.

  

This is just to hint the convenient interpretation of the ऋक् mantra0s.

  

With regards
