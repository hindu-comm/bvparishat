In the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad there is an episode aimed at bringing out the greatness of PrANa as against all other sense organs. Here, there arises a conversation among the various organs as to who among them is the most important, indispensable, to the jiva where they are all residing.  
  
One can read this entire episode in Br.Up. VI.i.7 to 14. \[In the Swami MadhvAnanda's English translation one can see this in pages 605 onwards in the Advaita Ashrama edition of the Ramakrishna Mutt. \]  
  
 प्राणस्य इतरदेवतापेक्षया श्रैष्ठ्यम् ।
