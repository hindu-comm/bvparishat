Dear Shri Krishna Murthy  
All I need to reply is Ignorance is your bliss you can remain in that state. What you talk has neither scholastic input or has any scientific relevance.  
  
"I have recently searched the Shankarabhaashya; for terms as implied by. It was occasioned by a book on Vedas given to me for review. He does refer to दृष्यत्वं असत्यं but not वस्तुतः असत्यं anywhere. He speaks of the misleading appearances but the unreality of the world as such. If you show me exactly where such an explicit reference is"  
  
  
What you are saying I cannot understand.  
  

"दृष्यत्वं असत्यं "  

are you talking abut Vyavahara or Parmartha  
  

He speaks of the misleading appearances but the unreality of the world as such.  
  

Are you talking about Illusions.  
  

"I subsribed to the view of Sir S. Radhakrishnan; and could not reconcile with Shankara. "  
  

Dr. Radhakrishna never said he is the sole and only interpreter of Shankara Advaita ( What interpretation you are giving is not subscibed in any of his publication) As I I have said earlier please read primary texts of Shankara. I hope you have read Adhyasaya Bhashya. If you have read and understood you would not be talking this way.
