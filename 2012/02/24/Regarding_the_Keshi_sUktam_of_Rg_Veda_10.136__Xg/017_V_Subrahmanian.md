Namaste.  
  
I wish to add one reference which I had not already stated in this discussion:  
  
  

(27-28) S'rî Parîkshit said: 'To establish the dharma and to subdue the ones defiant, descended indeed He, the Supreme Lord, the Controller of the Universe with His plenary portion \[Balarâma\]; how could He, the original speaker, executor and protector of the codes of moral conduct, behave to the contrary o brahmin, touching the wives of others? (29) What did He, so self-satisfied, have in mind with this assuredly contemptible performance, o best of the vowed, please dispel our doubt about this.'

\(30\) S'rî S'uka said: *'The transgression of dharma and thoughtlessness, as can be seen with controllers of spiritual potency, does not, as with an all-consuming fire \[staying the same\], mean they are at fault.*  
  
*(31) Someone not in control sure mustn't even think of ever doing a thing like this; such a one, acting out of foolishness, would be destroyed like one not being Rudra would be with \[drinking\] the poison from the ocean \[see 8.7\].*  
  
  

  
\[The above conversation occurs in the Canto of the Bhagvatam where the Rasa Krida is described\]  
  
  

The references of the Bhagavatam are 10.33.29 and 10.33.30.  
  
*dharmavyatikramo dR^iShTa* IshvarANAM cha sAhasam  
tejIyasAM na doShAya vahneH sarvabhujo yathA  
  
In this verse Sri ShukAchArya acknowledges that there is a 'dharma vyatikrama' in the cases where some sAhasam is displayed by Ishwara-s \[Those of very high stature\]. He also calls them 'tejIyasAm' very splendrous, highly accomplished, powerful beings.  
  
naitatsamAcharejjAtu manasApi hyanIshvaraH  
vinashyatyAcharanmauDhyAdyathA rudro.abdhijaM viSham  
  
Here Sri Shuka acknowledges and confirms that Rudra consumed the poison. The verse is significant for the additional reason that he gives Rudra's sAhasam to explain an act of Krishna in the Bhagavatam.
In Shuka's view Hari-Hara sAmyam is brought out in this comparison. The second line 'vinashyati.....' confirms that according to Veda VyAsa, the author, and ShukAcharya, the narrator, Rudra consumed the poison which was indeed potent. Otherwise, if they too had believed that Rudra consumed only the impotent poison there is no 'svArasya' in saying that others will perish if they imitate Rudra.
