Dear scholars,

I would like to get your help in the following matter.

  

The सुकविहृदयानन्दिनी टीका on वृत्तरत्नाकर by kedarabhatta has the following verse (as example of uddharSiNI meter):

  

संवत्सरे रसपयोनिधिसूर्यसंख्यैः श्रीविक्रमान्नरपते रचिता ममेयम्‌ ।

उक्ता सनामभिरुदाहरण्यैरुदारैरुद्धर्षिणी भवतु चेतसि सत्कवीनाम्‌ ॥

  

This would translate to 1246 vikram samvat i.e. 1190- 91 A.D.

The current understanding is that kedarabhatta must have lived before 15th century A.D. (M. Krishnamachariar).

If this verse is taken to be true, it would mean that the commentary itself was written in 1190 A.D., which would place Kedarabhatta before or in 12th century A.D.

Are there other references in other works on sanskrit history which would support the hypothesis ?

Also whether my interpretation ofरसपयोनिधिसूर्यसंख्यैः as 1246 tenable? (it is based on similar calculation in the work vRttamauktika )
