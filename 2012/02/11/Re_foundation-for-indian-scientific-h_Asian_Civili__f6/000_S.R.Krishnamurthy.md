Fie! Whom does the QAU cheat? They cheat themselves. They do not look beyond the tips of their noses; and so do not want to progress; for they are well aware that if they progress, they will be exposed to dazzling brilliance of historic TRUTHS,which, they are afraid, may blind them. So they prefer to hide their universities in their burqua of ignorance. All such civilisations are buried deep in the sands of time. History repeats itself! It is only a question of time.



I pity the fools. My condolences in advance to that idiotically blinkered 'civilization'! \[For I will not be there to witness its decimation\]. May the tribe of Dr. Salams increase and flourish!
