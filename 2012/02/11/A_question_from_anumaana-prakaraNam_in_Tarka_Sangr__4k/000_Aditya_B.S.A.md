नमो नमः

  

In the anumaana-prakaranam of Tarka-Sangraha is explained a difference in cognizance between the states of 'वह्निव्याप्यधूमवान् अयं पर्वत:'
and पर्वतो वह्निमान्, the former being linga-paramarsha which gives rise to the latter, being anumiti.

  

My understanding is as follows (this is in regard to svaanumitih):

  

1\. Svayameva bhooyO darshanena... he understands vyaapti from kitchen, etc, then goes to mountain, sees smoke.

  

2\. He remembers vyaapti, 'yatra yatra... vahni.'

  

3\. He correlates vyaapti and paksha dharmata.

  

Assuming that the above steps are correct, in the next step is where I have a slight problem understanding the consequence of events. What is the differentiating factor between'वह्निव्याप्यधूमवान् अयं पर्वत:' and पर्वतो वह्निमान्, which are the two steps of cognition that follow?

  

I have a hunchthat understanding this difference is crucial to understanding a subtle variation between the scientific method and the method of inference in Nyaya.

  

Regards,
