Namaste.  
  
From the Tarka sangraha portion/paragraph 42 where the 'पञ्चावयवाः’ are enumerated, I understand the 'वह्निव्याप्यधूमवान् अयं पर्वत:' that you have stated above as corresponding to the fourth avayava namely 'upanayaH'. And the पर्वतो वह्निमान् stated by you above corresponds to the 'nigamanam'. As per the 'dIpikA' we have:  
पक्षधर्मताज्ञानमुपनयः , अबाधितत्वादिकं निगमनप्रयोजनम् . Thus the difference between the two steps is that in the fourth step we get a confirmation of the (correctness of the*) application of the earlier steps* (hetu, dRShTAnta, vyApti) and in the fifth one we reiterate the partijnA vAkyam and complete the process of anumitijnAnam.  It is, in my observation, a kind of a 'sampuTeekaraNam' where the first and the last steps are almost similarly worded and all the process/exercise takes place in between.  
Maybe more learned scholars will correct the above explanation  
if found not to the point.
