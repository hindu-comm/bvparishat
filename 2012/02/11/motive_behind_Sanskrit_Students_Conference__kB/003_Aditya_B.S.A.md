नमो नमः

  

Mr. Pathak,

  

Please don't ever relent in your effort to keep this conference through the Sanskrit medium. The choice before you is simple: Succumb to the mediocrity of academicbureaucracy or maintain a sense of self-dignity that arises from the firm knowledge of being right. On the merits of your stance, you are 100% right. No one can deny that Sanskrit will only flourish when it is treated as a language in entirety, and not only a language confined to books.

  

Regards,

  

आदित्यः
