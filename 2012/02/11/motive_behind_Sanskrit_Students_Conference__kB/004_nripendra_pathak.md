Sir, thank you for your comment....

I just re-post my motive again here... plz see that and suggest me... I really need to find a better solution to "promote future generation of Sanskrit Scholars" and to encourage "college students who want a bypass to runaway from Sanskrit learning just because 'they think ' that Sanskrit learning is difficult".... if playersdeny practicing on the field, the can not win the tournament..... If doctor does not treat aparalyzed person by doingphysiotherapy,paralyzedpersoncan not stand up at all... all students should write and submit their paper in Sanskrit, try to present the paper in front of Scholars.... Scholars must encourage them... and of course try to rectify their language mistake (softly... so that they canrealizethe mistake).

I must thank you for giving me one beautiful suggestion to keep the session separate for the language learning students...

we will request our paper reviewers to give the suggestion on language and content separately.we will give to importance to the content of the paper and select the paper... when the students (whose paper is selected) will send their camera ready paper, they will correct the language as well.

in this way we can serve to purpose... we can encourage Sanskrit language learning and produce good research papers through the conferenc......

  
To support the Sanskrit medium in class room as well as in Students' Conference I have discussed the following points with our friends in JNU ( who are forcing me to keep other languages to find a bypass to run away from Sanskrit medium):

  

  

I am giving an internal evidence to support our demand:  
1. Phonetics is the sole of Sanskrit language.  
2. If we do not get opportunity to hear out teachers speaking Sanskrit, we can not learn to pronounce Sanskrit words correctly.  
3.we can not gain vocabulary of Sanskrit.  
4. we can not develop our style of speaking Sanskrit in an impressive way.  
5. we spend our valuable time with our teachers, if we are not gaining a communication skill from our teacher than what we are gining???  
6. If teachers are not talking in Sanskrit with themselves, whom the students will follow???  
7. If we are not forced to write and practice Sanskrit writing skills, should we not ask our teachers to force us towards a creative task of submitting our assignments only in Sanskrit and present our papers in front of our own friends during paper presentation???  
8. If we will not indulged ourselves in this little harder task, can we ever write and speak Sanskrit fluently???  
9. can anybody get the capability without indefinite practice???  
10. can a Master of parsian say that he is capable of reading and understating aupnikhat ( the translated version of upnishad by Darashikoh), thus he is the Master of Sanskrit language.... just reversing the question: If you have no command on parsian can you understand and express the content of upnikhat through original one ???  
11. without knowing the language, how one can say that he or she is the student of that subject???  
12. the importance of language learning is zero???  
13. If no cricket tournament will be organized, why players will practice???  

14. If we are organizing a Sanskrit Students' Conference just like cricket, our players are misguided by some students saying that they have right to play "gilli danda " on the same ground where cricket is being organised!!!!
