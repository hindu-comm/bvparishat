Hello:



 The FOLKS magazine ([www.folks.co.in](http://www.folks.co.in/)) for which I contribute regularly has opened a new fature 'Ask Rajaram' in which I will be answering specific questions from readers. You can visit the feature at:



<http://folks.co.in/ask-rajaram/>



 You may ask me about any topic but I will not endorse any commercial products. While I welcome the opportunity, I request readers to make the experience enjoyable and informative for both.



Sincere regards,

N.S. Rajaram
