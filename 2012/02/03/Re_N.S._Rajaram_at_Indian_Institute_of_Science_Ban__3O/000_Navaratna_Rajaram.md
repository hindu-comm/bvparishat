***ABSTRACT***

 Although extraordinarily successful, quantum mechanics, after more than a century after Planck and Einstein pioneered the subject, still lacks a firm foundation. For example the idea of reality—whether it has an objective existence or just an illusion of our own making—has not been resolved and remains controversial. Recent results like Bell’s theorem and Alain Aspect’s experiment have cast further doubts on the foundations of quantum physics.

 Some of the central problems addressed by Vedanta are the same as those arising in quantum physics— duality and reality. The great medieval thinker Madhva (1238 – 1317) addressed these issues, especially of reality in a metaphysical work known as *Tattva-Viveka.* He asserted that “There exist two orders of reality— independent and dependent (or unmanifest and manifest).” He further noted: “The knowledge of the many through knowledge of the One, is to be understood in terms of the preeminence of the One.”

 Madhva’s view was echoed by physicist Erwin Schrödinger, himself a committed Vedantin. He wrote: “It is quite easy to express the solution in words, thus: the plurality that we perceive is only *an appearance*; *it is not real*. Vedantic philosophy, …has sought to clarify it by a number of analogies, … \[of\] the many-faceted crystal which, while showing hundreds of little pictures of what is in reality a single existent object, does not really multiply the object.”

 All this indicates that a school of thought in philosophy of science that draws on Vedantic metaphysical thought that is at the same time scientifically rigorous can prove to be a fruitful area of research.
