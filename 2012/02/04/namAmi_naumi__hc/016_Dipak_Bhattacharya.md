Dear Professor Palit,

I do not remember if any scholar raised the following point. In that case please ignore it.

Prahvī-bhū ‘to bow down, to bend oneself in respect, to submit oneself respectfully’ is treated in Uṇādisūtras 1.150 (S.K., MLBD edn, Vol.4) . There as well as in the Osmania Univ. edn of the U.S. in the Kāśikā the word is derived from √hve to call. But the given explanation, according to me, is not satisfactory.

Wackernagel (AiG.III:324, § 164) derives it from (pra)√hvar ‘to bend one , to bow’ with irregular elision of the final r. hvar occurs from the Ṛgveda onward in the above sense.

Best
