What do you mean? Do you mean to get the grammatical derivation of

प्रह्वः or its meaning? or the meaning of प्रह्वीभवति or प्रह्वीभावः?  

  

The meaning of प्रह्व is given by Subrahmanyam as per dictionary, to bow down or humble down oneself.

  

For derivation the etymology is derived from प्र+ह्वेञ् +वन् (उणादिप्रत्ययः) - the meaning as given by Apte is perfect.



The second is given by me in my message, with derivation:

Simply प्रह्वीभावः means bowing down oneself. The extended meaning is given in my first post on नम्. and also by V Suprahmanyam.
