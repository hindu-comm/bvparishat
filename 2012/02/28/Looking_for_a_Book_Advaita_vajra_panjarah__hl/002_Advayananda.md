Dear Sri Subrahmanianji,  
Hari Om. Pranams.  
The book 'Advaita-vajra-pañjaraḥ' is authored by Sri Venkatanatha, the author of Brahmānandīyam. Brahmānandīyam is a commentary on the Bhagavad-gītā. In Brahmānandīyam he keeps referring to Advaita-vajra-pañjaraḥ saying: "This point, I have elaborated in Advaita-vajra-pañjaraḥ and hence am not elaborating in Brahmānandīyam." He keeps requesting the reader to refer to Advaita-vajra-pañjaraḥ.  
Other than this, I do not have much information on Sri Venkatanatha or Advaita-vajra-pañjaraḥ. I too have been searching for this book.  
Brahmandīyam has been published by the Vani Vilas Press and is also part of the 11 Commentaries on the Bhagavad-gītā published by the Parimal Publications.  
In Shri Guru Smriti,  
Advayananda
