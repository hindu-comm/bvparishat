Sir,



You will have the true scientific signifacance of 108, when I type out my latest research work on Sandhyavandana and Shakhapaddhati (of RSS). The paper is readied in Kannada and is to be typed out and edited. It will be a continuum of 'VedocChistam Jagatsarvam" (Sanskrit). Kindly bear with me for a short while; till I complete the typing.

s.r.krishna murthy.
