Namaste all,

  

I am looking for examples in Vedas, Puranas, Upanishads and in other Sanskritliteraturewhere description of an ailing person (physically ormentally) attaining*Moksha* is told.

Can anybody point to stories or instances in the ancient literature where such incidents occur?

  

Thanks in advance
