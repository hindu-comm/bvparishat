Namaste Madam,  
  
Thanks for your response. I think you could have posted this to the BVP itself instead of to me personally. The reason is this: When a thread is started, it appears on the BVP for all to see. If any response to it comes from any member it is good if it is published in the Group. For, someone who has evinced interest in the topic will be in the dark if the responses are not made public. Also, someone in the future looking into the archives may not find the complete course of the thread if responses are sent only to individual members.  
  
Here I am copying one more response to this thread which was sent to me personally:

Thanks a lot for the reply sir,

  

Your reply aptly fills the theoretical background for my worry.  

I was wondering whether proper physical health and a pure mind (even though the person is still in ignorance) can have a positive import in his/her spiritual passage towards *moksha*.

  

My research is concerned broadly with the notion of 'health' in Indian thinking (both orthodox and heterodox schools). I found that, in Indian schools of thought, 'health' is a notion which is frequently discussed with the notion of 'spirituality'. Health is understood only as an instrument for something higher to be attained. There is a teleology in the notion of health in Indian schools. It is also said that proper health triggers spiritual progress like a catalyst. But its clear from the Advaitic teachings that the 'mind' holds the key in the journey towards *moksha,* in terms of a realization, that, what is so far understood to be real is not real indeed. Thedistinguishing act between 'the real' and 'the illussionary' is a task performed by our mind, something related to the mental part of health. Therefore I was seeking the availability of counter examples, cases where an ailing person attains *moksha* (more apt for my purpose if its a mentally ailing person). I feel there are not any such stories.

  

thanks once again for the help.

hope I can contact you if i stumble intellectually.
