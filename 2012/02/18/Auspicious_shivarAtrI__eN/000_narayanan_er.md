Respected scholars,

I dedicate one of my verses to all the members of BVP in advance on the eve of the auspicious Śivarātrī towards the end of this Māgha month, during the Kṛṣṇacaturdaśī, Monday, 20th February 2012.  

  

नृत्तान्ते सूत्रजालं डमरुनिनदनान्नाट्यराजो मुनिभ्यः

प्रादादुद्बोधनार्थं चतुरधिकदश स्थायि सत् शब्दतत्त्वम्।

प्रत्याहारप्रणेता पणिनसुतनुतो यस्य पुण्येह शैवी

रात्रिर्नो माघभव्या व्रतरजनिरियं भूतिदा साऽऽपदोऽव्यात्।।

  

“The King of dance prostrated by Paṇina's son, creator of sigla, at the end of his dance, by his drum-beat, provided fourteen eternal and existing sound theory—the network of aphorisms to the sages, with a view to awakening them, whose auspicious night which occurs in the month of Māgha, prosperous here, a night for fasting, and let that Siva's Night protect us from all danger.”

  

Regards,

Narayanan
