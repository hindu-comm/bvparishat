Thanks to Dr Narayan and Prof. R K Sharma for the invocation of  
blessings.Let me follow Dr Narayan's metre to convey my joy for the  
forthcoming ShivarAtri in Lord SthANvIshvara's Kurukshetra :

NRttAnte tantraM AkhyAtum iva sa puruso DhakkayA paNca paNca  
NAdAn stene mahimnA punar api caturo brahma-bhANDam sisRkshuh /  
Tat paNcAshat-suvarNair dasha dasha dasha saT tattva-pushpANi rAtrAv  
ArdhANginyai praNIyA 'vatu kulina umA-sthANur eso 'py akulyah ! //

When the Dance has come to an end,  
Out of His supreme majesty behold,  
The unknown one,as it were to convey  
The lore,beat his drum ten,ten and four  
Times to generate this Brahma's vessel;  
With those fifty beautiful letters emanating  
Did He offer a number of ten,ten and six  
Elemental buds to his consort in the night.  
Let that SthANu,joined by UmA,protect us  
The 'well-born -kulIna-s',which He is not !

Best regards,  
SMMishra
