The question appears to be about what the Pancaratra text implies. If  
it is the Atharvashira Upanishad then as per tradition it would be the  
one starting with "devaa ha vai svargam..." If it were to be the  
Atharvas'ikhopanishat it starts as "athahainam paippalaado..." However  
if the qualification 'Upanishat' is removed then Atharva-s'ira can be  
part of the Naaraayanopanishat of the Yajurveda recited as  
"pratyagaananadam [brahma-purus.am](http://brahma-purus.am) pran.ava-  
svaruupam\|........etadatharvas'iro'dhiite\|.."  
This Upanishat gives "Rigvedas'ira, Yajurveda-s'ira, Saamaveda-s'ira"  
also. Perhaps more discussion and data would be needed to know the  
context in which the rites are performed.
