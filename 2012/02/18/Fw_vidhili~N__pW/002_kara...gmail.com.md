Dear Prof. Bhattacharya and other Vedic scholars,  
  
In a Pañcarātra text I am editing, I find the following verse which enumerates the sūktas an Ātharvaṇa has to recite:  
  
अथर्वशिरसं चैव स्कम्भसूक्तं तथैव च ।  
भद्रकल्पान् परिषदः पवित्रान् गणपाठकान् ।  
नीलरुद्रं ?नेत्रयो? sथर्व उत्तरतो यजेत् ।।  
  
Except Skambhasūkta, I am unable to identify them. Nīlarudra might be the Upaniṣad of this name, but which one is the original Atharvaśiras I do not know. I would be very grateful if I get some help in identifying them. The word after nīlarudraṃ, too, is a problem.
