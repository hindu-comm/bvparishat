Dear Dr. Acharya,

The नीलरुद्र is AVP 14. 3-4, pp.778-781 of my edition, also studied by T.Lubin, Griffiths-Schmiedchen Aachen 2007. The Atharva;siras and Netrabindu were published long ago by a Gujarati religious organisation and reprinted with the addition of the Adyar Library's Unpublished Upanishads by some publisher who did not add anything from new manuscripts.  

The text offered by you has many errors. So it is very difficult to comment further. If you sent a scanned image that might help. You on your own might consult the reprint of collection mentioned above. I do not have the same with me.  

Best
