Dear Dr, V. Jha,



MA in Translation course by CASS is right step in right direction. I am reading Marathi translation of the MImAmsA Darshana-Jaimini Sootra-ShAbara BhAs'ya-TarkapAda. I am enjoying it because it is so easy to understand difficult subject when translated in mother tongue. I congratulate Dr. UjjvalA Panse-Jha., the AnuvAdaka of thebook for presenting difficult subject in easy to understand language.During my recent visit to Department of Physics, Pune University, I picked up two books-one on Vis'ayatA vAda and second on TarkapAda from Publication section of Pune Univ. I wanted to visit CASS but did not get time. N.R.Joshi
