Thanks for the information.  
But the query was on Harivamsam and its current availability in print form.  
Today I visited Chaukhamba and found that some 30 publishers brought out  
editions on Harivamsha, and it is not clear which publisher has got Nilakanthi.  
  
Apologies for bothering the list.
