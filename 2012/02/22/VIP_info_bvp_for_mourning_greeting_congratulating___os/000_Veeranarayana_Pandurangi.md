dear all,

sorry for intervening.

  

thanks for bearing with us.

  

BVP has been created for some noble aims of improving the standards of research and understanding of language and science of samskrit. butof late BVP has become a garbage boxfor mourning, greeting, congratulating and personal correspondence !!!! waste of time of thousands of people!!!. many eminent scholars complained about the decreasing number of true discussions and only happy birthdays and sad deaths etc.

  

I am sorry for being a person congratulated recently by not less than 18 persons. not sorry for their congratulations. but for wasting time of many others as the byproduct. it is the ashiirvads of elders for us to continue goodwork. it is true our dharma is सत्यं ब्रूयात् प्रियं ब्रूयात् however this wastes many others time.

  

off course frits stall was a great man and deserves a good condolence. but what if all the 740 members of this list write individual condolence for him?it will be terrible.

  

here it is a message sent by one of our esteemed members.

As prof. Aklujkar said recently a moderated list is not acceptable for scholars. hence instead of moderation of all messages asmall change is made in the reply mode of this list. I hope this will improve the situation of the list.

  

**henceforth whenever a persons answers something to somebody, the answer will go to first persons email rather than to list.**

  

I request all the members to minimise the personal communications through list. please do not send your articals for journals through list.  

  

but then it should be reminded by all that even in the indology list and other lists the situation is same. perhaps only difference is the less congratulations but more sad deaths. India is the country of young people.

  

discussions happen themselves. they can not be created for the sake of discussions. as abhishek bacchan said "children happen. they can not be planned"
