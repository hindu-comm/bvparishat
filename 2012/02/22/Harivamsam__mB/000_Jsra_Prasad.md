Respected Scholars,  
  
Namaste.  
  
Nilakanthacharya has commented on Mahabharata including Harivamasa Purana.  
Since from a long time I have been searching for the edition on Harivamsa. I approached  
Chaukhama and Munshiram Manoharlal, but in vain.  
  
Please let me know, in case, if you have any bibliographical data with you, on this book.  
Thanks in advance.  
  
Regards  
Prasad
