Dear Sh[ri Iyengar](http://36ohk6dgmcd1n-c.c.yom.mail.yahoo.net/om/api/1.0/openmail.app.invoke/36ohk6dgmcd1n/9/1.0.35/in/en-IN/view.html/0 "narayana.iyengar@gmail.com")*,*

I just looked into the places of occurrence of the mantras.

The first four mantras occur as AVP 19.24.17-20

The next three as AVP 2.24.1, 19.28.13 and 17.22.10

Of these kāṇḍa 2 is published in Vol. 1, Asiatic Society, 1997; kāṇda 17 too is published in Vol.3, A.S. 2011; but I have not yet got the editor’s complimentary copies of the third volume; kāṇḍa 19 is in press;

Similar but not the same mantras occur in parts and with variants in AVŚ. 6.128

The mantras occur with many corruptions in Raghuvira’s edition taken from Barret’s edition of the Kashmir manuscript. They may not be of any use for your enquiry.

I cannot tell if the meaning of *śakadhūma* is not variable. Otherwise how to explain that Śakadhūma is called rājan ie moon in AVŚ 6.128.3. It represents denizens of the night sky --- this much cannot be denied.

Best
