Thanks to Prof.Bhattacharya, and Dr.Rajaram, for their response and  
interesting discussion.

Now I have looked into both the AV recensions. The one I mentioned in  
my previous post was obviously S'aunakiiya even though the editor does  
not mention this fact. The AVPPld version of Barret is available with  
me as soft copies from JAOS. I am aslo having the soft copy of  
Prof.Bhattacharya's edition in transliteration prepared in USA.

My doubt namely why AVPari. notes कृत्तिकारोहिणीमध्ये पैप्पलादा  
मन्त्राः ...... remains.  
As pointed out by Dr.Rajaram, even the RV text gives rise to the  
suspicion that some object was sighted between two others, in  
midspace. This was not the Moon, because AVS' 128.3 differentiates the  
two clearly as:  
ahoraatraabhyaam nakshatrebhyah.  
suuryaacandramaasaabhyaam........s'akadhuuma tvam kr.dhi\|\|

Can this be the Milky Way? Some western indologists seem to think so.  
But the evidence is otherwise, Milky Way is not just between Kr. and  
Rohin.i.

J.Carpentier has looked at several possibilities and concluded that  
S’akadhuuma to be identical with Kr.ttikaa. His is a very well written  
paper. But he did not think of the “object being in between two other  
asterisms”. \[Ref: Bulletin of the School of Oriental Studies,  
University of London, Vol. 8, No. 2/3,Indian and Iranian Studies:  
Presented to George Abraham Grierson on His Eighty-Fifth Birthday, 7th  
January, 1936 (1936), pp. 449-456\].

Interpretation as ‘weatherman/forecaster’ (JAoS 1968,Norman Brown)  
does not fit in with the title ‘Nakshatra-raaja’ and  
‘mahaanakshatraan.aam prathamajam jyotih.’

My hunch is it should have been a spectacular transient object perhaps  
visible in day time also. I wonder whether it could have been a comet  
trail or a nova…. Are there studies of 'Pravargya' from astronomical  
perspective?
