 Shakhadhuma might refer to some galaxy in the RV, the question is which one.



 I don't believe it can refer to Krittika a name which was well established by then. One possibility is that it was a generic term for a galaxy that was not part of the Nakshatra series but came between two Nakshatras.



 The transition was from Rohini to Krittika, as the Mahabharata also notes. (Mrigashira-Rohini-Krittika). This suggests that Shakdhuma was a generic marker between the two-- before the transition was complete (say from Rohini to Krittika).



 This seems to make RV passage also coherent-- that the poet (Dirghatamas) saw the 'vishuvat' in shakadhuma-- i.e. at an intermediate position between two astetisms of the Zodiac. If we can identify a specific asterism by the poet in question (Dirghatams) it might help identify it.



 Perhaps someone can shed light on this.
