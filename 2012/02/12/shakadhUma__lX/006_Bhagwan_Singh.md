I hesitate intervening when good scholars are discussing. But dhuum and dhaam have some opposite significations as well. There is no word for darkness. Those we use have opposit connotations:

tam/ taamra/ H. tamtamaanaa

andhkar/ andh 'rasa' \>anna.

masi 'ink black' \< mas 'moon'/masss 'lunar cycle'

nakta\< nak 'water'>nakra 'aquatic animal', naksSatra

kriNa \< kRshanu

kalima \< kal 'water', \>kaladhaut 'gold'

and so on so forth. I casually checked the correspondences but did to follow intently. Can shaka-dhuum mean hot ash, or heat produced by burning dred dung?

This is just a query. Not a solution.

BS .  .
