I strongly endorse the thought expressed by Shri R. Ramanisundaram (\<[bali...@gmail.com]()\>). Messages that are not likely to advance the Sanskrit-related or Indology-related discussions -- discussions related to trends, issues, concepts,words/terms, grammar, bibliographic information, new appointments likely to affect the Sanskrit/Indology scene etc. -- on the BVP list should be sent privately only to the persons directly concerned. The mail boxes of all members of the list should not the destination for such messages. This is particularly applicable to messages of congratulation, sympathy, and so on.

Just as the time of the list members should be treated as a precious commodity, care should be taken not to inflate the list archives (if they exist) with emails that are hardly likely to matter after a few days or that reproduce all or most passages of earlier messages. The best procedure in the latter respect is to quote only the truly relevant part of an earlier message at the beginning of one's own response.

I would also like to take this opportunity to suggest that those who make inquiries regarding prior research/publications on a particular topic should specify what they have already come to know as relevant and/or accessible. Using the BVP list simply to avoid a visit to libraries or website links or to avoid a consultation of translations and commentaries (.tiikaas, vyaakhyaas etc.) is unfair to other members.

The BVP list is slowly transforming the Sanskrit scene in India for the better. The generosity of some of its members in providing useful or potentially useful information and comment is truly impressive. Let us all work together to enhance the list's creative and scholarly efficiency.
