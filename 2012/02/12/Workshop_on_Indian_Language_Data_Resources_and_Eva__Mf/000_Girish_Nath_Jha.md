Dear all



Please check the seminar website at <http://sanskrit.jnu.ac.in/conf/wildre/index.jsp>



WILDRE â€“ the first workshop on Indian Language Data: Resources and Evaluation is being organized in Istanbul, Turkey on 21st May, 2012 under the LREC platform. India has a huge linguistic diversity and has seen concerted efforts from the Indian government and industry towards developing language resources. European Language Resource Association (ELRA) and its associate organizations have been very active and successful in addressing the challenges and opportunities related to language resource creation and evaluation. It is therefore a great opportunity for resource creators of Indian languages to showcase their work on this platform and also to interact and learn from those involved in similar initiatives all over the world.  
The broader objectives of the WILDRE will be

-   To map the status of Indian Language Resources -   To investigate challenges related to creating and sharing various
    levels of language resources -   To promote a dialogue between language resource developers and users -   To provide opportunity for researchers from India to collaborate
    with researchers from other parts of the world -
