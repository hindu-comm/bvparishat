Dear Aditya B.S.A.



I am looking for evidencewhichshows thatpeople from the subcontinent had entered Greek islands way before Trojan war. I have some evidence and I am trying to collect more. I am going to get the book : "Heracles in Mahabharata".I will write on BVP after that.



In my opinion there are two unsolved problems from the remote ancient Indian history-First the origin of highly inflected language Sanskrit and second-Mahabharata Empire-was it confined to the subcontinent or extended beyond the western boundary of the subcontinent? My efforts are to collect evidence to show that the ancient history of the other Asian and Middle-East countries was closely connected with Mahabharata. Thanks. N.R.Joshi.

Pardon me for asking a rather plebeian question... I'm just curious... What criteria do you think constitutes a 'proof' in this matter?
