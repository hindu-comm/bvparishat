I remember "राजा सार्वभौमोऽश्वमेधेन यजेत" as quoted from my memory of some commentary quoting it, authorizes kings willing to become सार्वभौम, and as Udayana quotes, it is meant :

1.  

    

    "*अश्वमेधेन यजेत*मृत्युब्रह्महत्यातरणकाम"**...**  

    

    

  

to overcome death, and Brahmahatya sin.

  

Anyhow it is काम्यकर्म and if the first is true, or even the second, it is not performed without the specific purpose to be served. And today there are no kings, but king-makers and for their benefit, there is no smRuti that prescribes it. The end itself justifies the propriety of the means adopted to achieve it.
