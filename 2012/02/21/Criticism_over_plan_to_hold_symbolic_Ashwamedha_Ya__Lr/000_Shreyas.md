Of late, the Bangalore bureau of "The Hindu" also seems to have joined the ranks of the pseudo-secular,

supposedly rational , english media. There has been plenty of one-sided coverage of the Karnataka State's

proposal to introduce Srimath Bhagavath Geetha as a optional subject in schools. Now this.



Perhaps interested and erudite members may consider writing to "The Hindu" countering this with

appropriate pramanas from related texts.

Getting ready:Preparations for the symbolic Ashwamedha Yaga are in full swing near Doddapura in Hassan taluk.

A section of progressive thinkers, writers and artists have criticised plans to organise a symbolic Ashwamedha Yaga near Doddapura on Hassan-Arsikere Road in Hassan taluk.

The Samartha Ramashrama Seva Trust, which came into existence recently, is organising the event at a cost of nearly Rs. 8 crore.

The preparations for the event are in full swing at ‘Saketapura'.

**Large crowds expected**

The yaga, which is scheduled to be held between February 29 and March 7, is expected to attract lakhs of people, including politicians.

About 1,500 priests are expected to take part in religious programmes every day during the event, which would be held under the guidance of Rama Avadhoota. Avadhoota, a native of Belur taluk, set up the trust with the help of\` a few followers.

Sridhar of the trust claimed that the event was being organised for the welfare of mankind.

The proposed event has invited the wrath of many progressive thinkers and writers. Well-known artist and progressive thinker K.T. Shivaprasad criticised it strongly. “It is nothing but a waste of money.” Writer and advocate Ja. Ho. Narayanaswamy said that India's growth had been obstructed by rigid minds that conducted yagas.

“India is the country that showed what spirituality is to the world. The essence of spirituality is that whatever is godly is within everybody. It is sad that vested interests are fooling the public in the name of such yagas and yagnas,” he said.

Environmentalist and social activist H.P. Mohan alleged that political parties were behind organising the mega event. “Otherwise, such an event could not have been organised. It is well known that such yagas will not do anything good for mankind. Then where is the need to spend so much money,” he asked.

He pointed out that the State Government had recently cancelled Hoysalotsava celebrations citing drought in the district. “It is strange that when farmers are suffering, we are witnessing an event to be held at a cost of crores of rupees,” he said.
