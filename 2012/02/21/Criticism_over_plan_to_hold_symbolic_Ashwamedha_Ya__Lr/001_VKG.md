Ashwamedha Yaaga.

  

The name evokes some mythological and logical interest.

Why is the Yajna required at first place?

Who is eligible to do that?

What is the usage?

(Next question is directed towards religious/ dharmik persons?)

Which scripture stipulates the conduct?

And

What is the procedure to be adopted?

What are the resources required? Are they available?

--

As I had the first hand interaction, with some of the organisers, including the motivator/ initiator; and had an occasion to listen to their statements.

  

After all this, I did not have a reason to change my perception that Conduct of Ashwamedha Yaaga is futile and unnecessary, as Smruti Granthas (Sounaka etc.) has explicitly banned this in Kali Yuga.

Parayanam is quite sufficient, to achieve what ever meaningful merit, may occur.

  

In the absence of right resources, such events could be the subject of mock, for obvious reasons. We are witnessing it.
