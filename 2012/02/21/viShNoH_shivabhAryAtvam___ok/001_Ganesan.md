Dear Subrahmanyan,  
It is a nice query and an important one also.  
  
There are many references to Vishnu being the Devi of Siva which views are collected by Appayadikshita in his Ratnatrayapariikshaa and Stotrapanchakam.  
I am not able to give you the exact references now, but you can get them from the publication of the series " Collected works of Appayadiikshita" pub. from Secunderabad.  
I think the very first verse of Ratnatrayapariikshaa speaks about this and the Svopajnavritti of Appayadiikshita gives many references from the Kurmapurana, etc.  
I think there is reference to this view also in the Srutisuuktimaalaa of Haradatta.  
  
Regarding the same view that Hari is the Devi and Hari as one-half of Siva there are references in the Tevaaram verses of Saint Appar (Tirunavukkaracar). From the Tamil passages you have given below I understand that you are conversant with reading Tamil also.  
So I give the passage in Tamil script:  
The well known passage of Appar in his Tevaaram,  
"அரியலால் தேவி இல்லை ஐயன் ஐயாறனார்க்கே"  
"Apart from Hari (in Tamil அரி, as there is there is no 'ha' sound in Tamil) there is no Devi for the God Siva of TIRUVAIYAARU--the well known Saiva holy place on the banks of Kaveri near Thanjavur. Also in other Tevaaram verses of Appar we have the same view expressed.  
There are also some more such passages which I had seen elsewhere but when I remember them I will try to pass it on to you.  
With the best wishes  
Ganesan
