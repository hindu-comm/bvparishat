It is indeed an important topic to be looked into. I would like to add in this regard that in "sriirudrapra"sna at the end there is a line - om namo bhagavate rudraaya vi.s.nave m.rtyur me paahi\| (source - mantrapu.spam, Ramkrishna math pub.). so my query is - does this \*vi.s.nave\* refers to the idea that vishnu as the concert ("sakti) of Siva?
