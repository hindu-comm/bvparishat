               i need a list of national and international journals where we can contribute papers related to philosophy, sanskrit studies, darshanas or shastras. Both general and very specific journals will also help. kindly enlighten.

  

Dear Dr. Achar,

  

A good first step will be to let the BVP members know the ground you have already covered, that is, by posting a draft of the list you wish to prepare or have already started to prepare. This way you will help them in avoiding repetition as well as make a contribution to the environment of learning.

  

A nearly comprehensive list (barring some journals that came into being, say, in the last ten years) can be prepared by consulting the introductory parts of the following books:

Dandekar, R.N. 1993. Vedic Bibliography. Vol. 5. (consult vol. 1 or Renou, L. Bibliographie Vedique for journals that might have ceased publication)

Potter, Karl H. Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies. Third edn of Vol. 1. Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass. See also<http://faculty.washington.edu/kpotter/ckeyt/home.htm>

Cardona, George. 1976. Panini: a Survey of Research and 1999. Recent Research in Paninian Studies.Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass.

  

As a good list etiquette, please make your consolidated (and consistently prepared, easy-to-search) list available to this forum at a later date. Then, I am sure, several members will make additions to it and help you (and the field) in making it up-to-date.

  

a.a.
