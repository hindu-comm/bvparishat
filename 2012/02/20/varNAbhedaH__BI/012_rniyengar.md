In the context of Vedic consonants and their regional sound  
variations, BR Sharma's Vedic Heritage of India (RSV, Tirupati 1991)  
is a good reference. For example 'purukha' of the S'ukla-Yajurvedins  
from the north is equivalent to the 'purus.a' of the SVY-south. He  
lists several others.  
Regional variation was recognized already in the S.ad.vims'a-  
braahman.a (I.3.16):
