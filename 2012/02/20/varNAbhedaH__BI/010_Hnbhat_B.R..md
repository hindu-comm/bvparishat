ल \> ळ \> ड . had been discussed in Vedic context earlier in this message:

There should be some other threads too which I could not find right now. Anyhow, the source of the quotation could not be traced, while the first line collects the commonly variants for the letters interchangeable with certain words which may or may not be under the influence of Prakrit or Pali dialects. But this collects variable letters in certain words which are mostly found in Classical Literature.

  

Some more examples could be cited. Mostly they are used in writing with dialectal variations in pronunciation and in some cases they are used for श्लेष - like जड - जल - etc. They are commonly found in manuscripts from the regions in which these variants are used predominantly.

  

वटुः, ० बटु , is the commonly found variant. रेखा ०- लेखा, but not रीरा for लीला. or ररित for ललित.

Only certain words exhibit these variations and not all words with these letters.

  

Similarly, यवनिका -vl. जवनिका, but not जयः any where written as जजः.

Only this follows the transformation in Prakrit the ya \> ja.

  

There is शब्दभेदप्रकाशः of Purushottama deva, the composer of different types of lexicons, including a supplementary one to Amara called त्रिकाण्डशेष. This records many words with different vowels and variable consonants used commonly.

  

In prakrit, generally, श ष will be replaced with स. In Sanskrit, certain words are there शिञ्जिनी - सिञ्जिनी = धनुर्गुणः, शिञ्जा - शिञ्जा etc. but not generally found interchangeable.

  

  

शसयोर्मनयोश्चान्त्ये सविसर्गाविसर्गयोः ॥

सबिन्दुकाबिन्दुकयोः स्यादभेदेन कल्पनम्‌ ।"

  

The above line doesn't seem to go with earlier interchangeable consonants. It seems to refer to certain words with and without visarga for श and स (in the final possition) in addition (to the one cited above example interchangeable) and with and without अनुस्वार for "म्" and "न्" without making much difference in pronunciation.

  

निःशब्दः - निश्शब्दः, निःस्वनः - निस्स्वनः, etc. due to the operation of the rule वा शरि (= पा\_८,३.३६) interchangeable with शुत्व. The second can be the अनुस्वार variable with परसवर्ण . सन्धिः - संधिः, for the m - n. For the other, there won't be any case, as it occurs in occurs only in the internal "sandhi" the "bindu" and which will invariably take परसवर्ण without option to use "bindu: But in writing it is not strictly followed and both could be found as पंच and पञ्च which could not be justified grammatically. Likewise, मंच - मञ्च. etc. Explicitly n with "bindu" is बन्धुः is commonly written as बंधुः also. This is just the idea I get from the lines as these variants are found in manuscripts profusely.
