Thank you Sir, for the references. Likewise we can point out the 'तम आसीत्, तमसा गूळ्हमग्रे’ of the nAsadIyasUktam where the गूळ्हम् appears to mean गूढम् (आच्छादितम्).  
  
Also, in the manner mentioned by Shri Shiva Senani, we come across the word pronounced 'ekAdsI' by Kannada people to mean 'ekAdashI'. Not that Kannada does not have 'sha', but this word is mostly pronounced this way even by Brahmins. 'LakShmi' has become 'lakumi' in Sri Purandaradasa's work. Even across two languages we see 'वीटी’ of Sanskrit has become 'betel' in English. The Tamil town name: vatthalakunDu' is written in English as 'BatlagunDu'.
