Following are the abhedas assumed here:

  

1\. ra and la - seen in rekha/lekha, raghu/laghu etc.

2\. da and la - seen in some regions. Many times we do inter-use ra and da; I remember seeing advertisements for 'biri' (bidi) in Bihar / Jharkhand. Or, consider: Chandigarh, the last component being pronounced गढ् and and not गर. Maybe we should first substitute ra for da, and then la for ra following the rule above.

3\. ja and ya - seen in yamuna/jamuna, yashwant/jaswant etc. also in the pronunciation of Jerusalem etc. Very common, esp. where Rigveda is popular. Ja is substituted for ya in all Prakrits. This is also seen across the world, not just India.

4\. va and ba - widely prevalent in Bengal

5\. sha (श) and (स) - seen in some prakrits. Remember the song: सोर नही बाबा शोर .. शोर ?

6\. ma and na - ?

7\. sa-visarga and a-visarga - seen in prakrits

8\. sa-binduka and a-binduka - ?  
  
Out of 8, I am exposed to at least 6. Famous ones like ba-va-yor abhedah would be found in the praatiSaakhyas - in this case, that of the Sukla Yajurveda (I am not too sure, but I hope I remember correctly). The substitutions allowed by praatiSaakhyas normally are restricted to that Sakhaa - technically the branch of Veda only, but Vedic scholars tend to follow the in-distinction in their speech as well and the lay population tends to follow the Vedic scholars. That's how these substitutions became so widespread, the lack of sanction by Panini notwithstanding.

  

The substitutions in Prakrit are less well known, but there are many instances of them, nevertheless. A C Woolner's 'Prakrit Primer' would be a good starting point - with some 100 odd clear rules given. प्राकृतप्रकाशिका is the traditional book recommended.

  

No. 6 and 8 are beyond me.

  

There is very little Slesha in Mahabharata, and very less in Ramayana. There is a wider prevalence of Slesha in mahakaavyas, but even there normally poets do not use these abhedas, except when pun has a poetic value, or in chapters devoted to chitrakavitvam. Even where they do use, only the more popular abhedas, i.e., ra-la, ja-ya and va-ba. While I have not studied the panca mahaa-kaavyas cover to cover, I would venture to say that Prakrit-specific abhedas were not used in the pancamahaakavyas.
