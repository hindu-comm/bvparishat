Dear Sir,  
  
I just went through the said article. But your understanding of Sri. Mmadhvaachaarya questioning the Mahaabhaarta needs some clarification for his ground of questioning it is entirely based on a different perspective and it is essentially theistic in nature while your stand, as I infer, is in the rationalistic plane. This very much so even in his understanding of apurushsEyatva of the Vedas and this is the general stand of all theistic systems of Indian philosophy. This, in essence is no way different form the stand of the so called people of the book! Can you pl through light on this aspect?  
  
regards
