Namaste:



 I agree with you. The article was written for a young skeptical audience that has been brainwahsed into believing that Vedanta is superstitious belief.



 People of the Book ask you to accept their belief as dictated by the 'prophet' or son of god. The late Ram Swarup called them God-substitutes. Any book can only be a human creation and cannot be apaurusheya.



Best,

N.S. Rajaram
