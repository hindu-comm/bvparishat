as annouced in the concluding session of Newdelhi WSC Sansthan has intitiated a  
International Series of Indological Publications.

I congratulate Prof. Tripathi for taking this important decision.

Morover I request to publish a series where many important research  
outputs (already published in english and other european languages)  
can be translated into samskrit for the benefit of thousands of  
indian students who are mostly out of this english world.

अथ चेत्त्वमिमं धर्म्यं संग्रामं न करिष्यसि।  
ततः स्वधर्मं कीर्तिं च हित्वा पापमवाप्स्यसि।।  
तस्मादुत्तिष्ठ कौन्तेय युद्धाय कृतनिश्चयः।  
निराशीर्निर्ममो भूत्वा युध्यस्व विगतज्वरः।। (भ.गी.)
