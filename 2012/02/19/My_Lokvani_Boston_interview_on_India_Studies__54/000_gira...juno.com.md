Respeced Scholars, Namaskar!



Mahabharata copied from Greeco-Roman sources.



I read this e-mail "My Lokvani (Boston) interview on India Studies" by Dr. N. Rajaram. Challenging the Western views about ancient history and culture of India is prescribed. Good!



Here is the new challenge for those who would like to take challenge



Book" Abstracts of Papers-15th WSC"Page: 96 Author: Wulff Alonso, Title of Abstract: The 4th Book of the Mahabharata and its Greek Sources.



The author says Mbh and the Book of Virata used Greco-Roman sources. He claims that many of the components are taken from Heracles and Omphale. Then helists similarities between the story of Droupadi, killing of Keechaka, hero Beema and elements from adventures of Heracles. The author has written the book, "Heracles in the Mahabharata".



I am looking for a concrete proof that either Greco-Roman sources copied story from Mbh or two stories have nothing to do with each other. Just saying that Mbh war took place 3000 BC is not proof. There is no archaeological evidence that war took place 3000 BC. It is based on astronomical evidence and on this list we have seen before that two astronomers do not agree with each other. I do not want only patriotic outburst.



Wherever I showed my Mahabharata power point (in India and in USA) not a single listener presented counter evidence. Some simply got upset because they realized how come they neglected what is obvious on the ground instead searching in stars. During my lecture on Mahabharata in India, there was one doctor in audience who traveled all over the world. At the end of my presentation he remarked that he has seen with his eyes in museums of the world what Dr. Joshi presentated with his power point.



So please I need proof that Greeks took story from Mahabharata. No guess work. Those who dance with Dr. Kazanas (Greek) lectures in India could ask this question to him in his next visit to India.Thanks. N.R.Joshi
