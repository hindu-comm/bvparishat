Dear Scholars,

  

Here is my comment on the observation of Prof. Bhattacharya in response to Prof. Pandurangi's query...

  

Paninis technical language developed for the purpose of writing grammar was an extension of Natural Sanskrit Language. It does not mean that that technical terminology can be adopted in our day-to-day interaction.

  

In west if we look at the development of logic and linguistics, an extensive usage of symbolic language for technical purposes. Ultimately it led to the development of artificial languages based on formal structures. This was not so in India. Panini, who used the power of formal approach to development of his generative grammar, did not invent a symbolic language. Instead, he formalised the Sanskrit Language in restricted sense that suits to his technical domain and serves his purpose of unambiguous representation. For example, he restricted the meaning of the cases he employs in his ashtadhyayi - tasmin iti nirdishte purvasya, tasamaad ity uttarasya, shashthI sthaane yogaa..etc.

  

There are hundreds of examples we can work out to show that Panini with out any effort of coining a new artificial terminology achieved his goal. For that he uses the simple Sanskrit Language by restricting it with in the purview of his domain which gives power to natural language to serve the purpose of artificial language.

  

This is what the meaning of Frits statement.

  

Yesterday I attended a lecture of Dr. R. Ganesh in Bangalore, who spoke on Bharatiya Samshodhana Paddhati : a bird view. It was an excellent deliberation with an abundant information from different disciplines. He made an observation that no reason was found that why Indian thinkers did / could not develop a formal methodology for scientific disciplines, as western counterpart did, which caused for the development of modern scientific discoveries in a disciplined manner. However, I would say that this example of Panini shows that Indian Shastrakaras always tried to adapt the principle of problem based approach. They never tried to separate "content and form" unless it is inevitable, though they knew the method that was worked out in Panini. Too much formalism is waste of time with out understanding of content, which is otherwise a source of power that fasten the mechanical process of any discipline. Hence, my appeal to scholars is that let us reinvent the whole indian scientific methodology across the disciplines to understand how different problems are addressed that very much require formal approach, with out adapting it?
