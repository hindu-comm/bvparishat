I did not read the article but if what Dr. Pndurangi said is true, then Staal has commented in a way and upon a thing that he should not have and should have avoided.

Metalanguage is restricted to denoting technical languages that are never spoken in non-technical domain.. ac, hal, [gu.na](http://gu.na) etc belong to this cataegory. Do we use them in daily speech ? We use them only in communicating on grammar. kalaapa, vopadeva, Kaccaayana each had his own metalanguage like Panini had. That of none became part of daily language. I do not understand how a scholar can say such things. Of course a few Paaninian terms have been generalised like 'halanta cihna'. We do not say vyanjana cihna. But that does not mean that we have generalised every technical term of Paanini
