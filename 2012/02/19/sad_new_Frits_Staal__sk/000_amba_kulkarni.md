Dear all,  

  
Frits Staal, the famous Indologist passed away today Sunday 19th Feb in Thailand.  
  
I remember reading his article on Euclid And Panini which had a great impact on me. He served as a bridge between the traditional scholars and the students like us who had their basic education through the western system, through several of his articles on Indian logic, grammatical tradition and Vedas.
