Prof. Staal in his article 'Euclid and Panini' draws a comparison  
between the methods employed by Euclid and Panini. Both of them are  
more or less contemporaries.  
  
Both of them had precursors, and have constructed more or less a  
complete system on the works of their predecessors, almost shadowing  
the early work.  
  
Euclid's "Elements" is a book of 13 chapters. There are axioms  
(initial statements), propositions and theorems derived from these  
initial statements by deductive methodology.  
  
Staal has provided representative examples from both the 'Elements' of  
Euclid and from Panini's A.s.taadhyaayii to illustrate the parallels,  
and the derivational process in both the systems.  
  
He observes that the criterion of simplicity (laaghava) is followed in  
both the systems.  
  
Just as in India, the knowledge of [vyaakara.na](http://vyaakara.na) is essential to study  
any other shaastra, in Europe, Plato had reserved admission to his  
Academy only for geometricians.  
  
In other words, the European knowledge system was dominated by the  
mathematical methods whereas linguistic studies dominated Indian  
Knowledge systems.  
  
In short, the roles Euclid played in Europe and Panini in India are  
comparable, and both of them set new paths for the future growth.
