Sirs,

even according to modern science, space is one homogeneous entitiy; ie., with no parts. we may recognise partitions such as room in phrases like room temperature, room pressure, cabin pressure, etc. with reference to closed areas; but once the closure is removed, the enclosed spaces becomes one with the whole space.
