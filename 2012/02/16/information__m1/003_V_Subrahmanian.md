I am reminded of my nephew's experience. He, an employee of Infosys, Bangalore, was on a project deputation to Japan for a few months. He said that since almost all the vyavahAra, even technical, is done in Japanese alone, there is a very important role for translators there.
Even while conversing with people in offices/marketplace, etc. to have a translator/interpreter is highly beneficial and sometimes a must. Expert translators who are well versed in Japanese and other languages like English are held in great esteem and their salaries are very high.  
  
So, any serious effort in the training and development of translators is indeed commendable, especially in the spoken arena. Scholars who are capable of expressing technical matter (that is in vyakarana, nyaya, vedanta, kAvya, etc.) only in Sanskrit can happily be invited to give discourses/presentations in non-sanskrit knowing states/countries/universities/institutions and there the role of translators is immensely great. I remember an event of yester-years.
Shri L.K.Advani had been invited to address a gathering in Kalady (birth place of Adi Shankara), Kerala in the 1980's. Even as he was delivering the talk in English, a local person neatly rendered it into Malayalam, much to the joy and appreciation of the majority people assembled there.
