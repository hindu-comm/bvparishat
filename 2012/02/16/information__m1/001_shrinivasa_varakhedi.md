Dear Professor Jha ji,

  

It is indeed a great job the CASS has accomplished. This kind of novel course was required for Sanskrit students to get the jobs in market. I know sometimes the traditional scholars may argue that such courses might reduce the weight of research in Sanskrit and these are market driven courses with out any scope for research further. The similar questions were raised when we started NLP courses in Tirupathi, which was later entirely spoiled. However, I would like to support this with an argument that such courses will increase the strength of students and new horizon in the field of Sanskrit studies. I have no doubt about the success of such a course. I congratulate you and Prof. Ujjwala for designing this.

  

May i know the course details and contents of the course, so that we can pursue the interested students for taking this course.

  

regards,

shrivara
