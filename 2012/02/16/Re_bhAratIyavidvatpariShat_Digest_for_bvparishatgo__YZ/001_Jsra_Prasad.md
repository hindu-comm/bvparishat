Dear Girish ji,  
  
You may contact NMM in Delhi which is currently conducting a 41 days workshop in Manuscriptology&Paleography at GOML, Hyderabad. I personally know a few scholars in this respect and following are their names -  
  
- Prof. T.K. Ganjoo, Kashmir (Sarada)  
- Pt. Satkari Mukhopadhyay, NMM/IGNCA (manuscriptology/vyakarana)  
- Dr. S. Jagannatha, ORI, Mysore (Grantha)  
- Dr. V.V. Jaddipal, R.S.Vidyapeetha, Tirupati (Grantha)  
- Prof. Ratna Basu, University of Culcutta, Kolkata (Brahmi/Manuscriptology)  
- Dr. M. Prabhakara Rao, ORI, Tirupati (Grantha)  
  
I assume that scholars who know Grantha, can also deal with Brahmi.  
  
Regards,  
Prasad
