Dear Prof. Jha,

  

For Grantha, there must be someone proficient in the Government Oriental Manuscripts Library, Chennai, and the Oriental Research Institute and Manuscripts Library, Univ. of Kerala, Kariavattom (Trivandrum/Thiruanantapurak), Kerala.

  

In my experience, Prof. N.V. P. Unithiri reads Grantha well. He used to teach atSree Sankaracharya University of Sanskrit, Sreesankarapuram, P.O. Kalady, Ernakulam Dt., Kerala 683 574. I do not have his current address.

  

If you can accommodate experts outside India, I would recommend Dr. Saraju Rath (who, I think, is a member of this list) and Dr. Gerhard Ehlers (Orientabteilung der Staatsbibliothek Preussischer Kulturbesitz, Potsdammer-str. 33, Postfach 1407, D-1000 Berlin 30. Germany.)

  

\_A Primer in Grantha Characters\_ by (the late) K. Venugopalan, published by James H. Nye, 319 West Swift Street, St. Peter, Minnesota 56082, is very useful.

  

For Grantha as well as Brahmi, V. Kanniyan's -Scripts in and around India\_ (The Superintendent, Govt. Museum, Madras 8, 1960) gives the signs in clear forms.

  

Prof. Richard Salomon (Dept of Asian Languages and Literatures, University of Washington, Seattle) is the most knowledgeable expert of Brahmi known to me personally. From what I have read, Shri Iravatham Mahadevan must also be exceptionally proficient, but I do not know how mobile he is nowadays.

  

The ;Saradaa script is adequately covered in Dr. Shri Natha Tikku's \_ ;Saaradaa Lipi Diipikaa\_ published by the Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan in 1988 and in Prof. Walter Slaje's Indische Schriften Band I, \_;Saaradaa\_, published by Dr. Inge Wezler, Verlag fuer Orientalistische Fachpublikationen, Reinbek, in 1993.

  

Almost all scholars working on Kashmir ;Saivism from primary sources read ;Saaradaa well. You should not have much of a difficulty in locating experts in India.
