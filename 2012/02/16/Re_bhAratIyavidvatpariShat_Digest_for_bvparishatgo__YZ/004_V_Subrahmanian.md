Traditionally for centuries the Veda adhyAyi-s of Tamilnadu have practiced studying books in Grantha script. They are quite a large number of people, even today, studying Veda-s in grantha script. Any GhanapAThi of Tamilnadu should be able to be of use to the seminar. Pl. contact a good institution like the Kanchi Kamakoti Peetham, Madras Sanskrit College, etc. MahamahopAdhyAya Prof.R.Krishnamurthy Sastrigal, Retd. Principal of Madras Sasnkrit College could provide leads in this.
