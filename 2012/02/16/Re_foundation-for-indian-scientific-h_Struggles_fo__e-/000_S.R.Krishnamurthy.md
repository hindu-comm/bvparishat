Dear Sri Kalyanaraman,



I am reminded of

^(Shankarachaarya's exposition of Aitareya Upanishad 1-3-12)[^(\[1\])](https://mail.google.com/mail/html/compose/static_files/blank_quirks.html#_ftn1)^(.) ^(iÉåwÉÑ ½rÉqÉÉuÉxÉjÉåwÉÑ mÉrÉÉïrÉåhÉÉiqÉpÉÉuÉålÉ uÉiÉïqÉÉlÉÉåÅÌuÉ±rÉÉ SÏbÉïMüÉsÉÇ aÉÉRÇû mÉëxÉÑmiÉÈ xuÉÉpÉÉÌuÉYrÉÉ lÉ mÉëoÉÑkrÉiÉåÅlÉåMüzÉiÉxÉWûxÉëÉlÉjÉïxÉÍ³ÉmÉÉiÉeÉSÒÈZÉqÉÑªUÉÍpÉbÉÉiÉÉlÉÑpÉuÉæUÌmÉ \|\| \[One who has slept fast and long with the false belief that the three sites (the right eye, the innate intellect and the heart) constitute the soul, does not wake up in spite of being battered by the sledge-hammer of grief born out of fits of crores of misfortunes\].)

What he exclaimed is true even today. Even during the freedom struggle, Sir M.V. quotes his book 'Memoirs of Working Life' that he visited Sri M.R.Jayakar; and in passing the verandah, observed a bed-ridden person in an adjoining room; and therefore queried Mr.Jayakar about the person. Mr.Jayakar quipped in reply 'he

Unfortunately the Hindu society is by and large myopic; and post-independence in particular, is intellectually paralysed. They are totally unconcerned about what happens beyond the tips of their own noses.



I raised a hue and cry when my attention was drawn to acinema titled 'Exorcist'; in the year 1975. I told that it was an act of **'Spiritual Terrorrism of the Church'** and requested all the so-called **'intellectuals**' of Bangalore to protest against. In particular, I contacted Sri H.Narasimhiah, Principal of National College, Bangalore; who was in the forefront of a committee challenging the validitiy of the producing of Vibhuti (white dust) by the (now late) Sri Satya Sai Baba. Sri H.N. refused to join the issue. When I queried that he had fought against Sri Satya Sai Baba, why he is declining to raise against this unscientific terrorrising the youn minds. He declined to be drawn into any argument over the issue. Then another member of the Fact-findind Committee, who was a cousin of my father-in-law and Congress Member not only refused to join the issue, but also threatened me that I would be 'put in' if I did not desist from my efforts. \[That was the time when Emergency had been imposed\]. Even the press had been gagged.



Even today \[of course, I hardly watch TV\], I understand X-rated films are regularly shown depicting ghosts which cannot be conquered except by a piece ofrustediron of the shape of a cross. Even Christian priests cannot face the ghosts; they can protect themselves (poor fellows) only with a rusted iron cross they find in the rubble in their attics. The pity is that even the politicians, the advocates and jurists and others who swear in the holy name of Hinduism day-in and day-out refused to join me in the struggle, demanding me to produce the evidence. Meanwhile thousands and lakhs of Hindu youth (weak-minded by nature) have converted to Christianity by such terrorist mischiefs and frauds.



One more feature adopted by church is the valentine day; and is the Churchian way of Love-Jehad. The church, particularly the evangelist, openly endorses even foul methods in proseletyzing, declaring that nothing is a sin in baptising a pagan; and those who succeed will be assured of their welcome to heaven. So the Christians are ready for any means of enticement of the Hindu boys; particularly the meek and studious at the educational institutions.



The Govt. is aware of these things; but for political considerations, is mute. Many organisations also are also afraid of taking any steps without tangible evidence; in spite of the telling effects.



I am glad that at least a few individuals and small groups are alive to the situation. And even in my declining years and health, I am one with you on the subject.



Yours fraternally,

s.r.krishna murthy.
