dear all

**here is theResolution text that is finally passed in WSC. thanks for all the members who supported the proposal.**

  

"The libraries in India have suffered very seriously during the foreign exchange shortage days. Since Sanskrit is the most widely studied Indian language in countries other than India and since Sanskrit is useful in a multitude of disciplines, the effect of the inability to purchase most of the Sanskrit-related foreign publications has been crippling. The General Assembly of the 15th World Sanskrit Conference recommends to the Government of India to repair this lamentable situation as early as possible. An experts' committee from different parts of India should be established to assess the situation. This committee should make recommendations as to the number of centres of documentary resources (books, journals, digital texts, microforms etc) needed and their locations. Effort should be made to avoid duplication and maximize the efficiency of access from all parts of India. Collaborations and exchanges with major foreign publication agencies and institutions should be established. Their working should be examined on a regular and comprehensive basis. A computer linking of neighbouring libraries should be encouraged. The aim should be to increase awareness in India of the latest foreign achievements in the field of Sanskrit as well as to inform other countries about the publications taking place in India."
