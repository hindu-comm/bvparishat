hariH OM,  
  
 a well argued article:  
<http://bharatabharati.wordpress.com/2012/02/07/interfaith-dialogue-unveiling-of-postmodern-evangelisation-george-augustine/>  
  
Excerpts:  
****Rajiv Malhotra comes through as a pathetic figure in a tragedy, being tossed around like a pawn by the special effects villainy of Clooney, only to be ridiculed at the end by many of his Hindu brethren and well-wishers including this writer, who appreciate his initiatives like the [Hindu Good News](http://hindugoodnews.com/) and the research work undertaken by him.  
  
****To correct the wrong Rajiv Malhotra has done to his own true traditions by misrepresentation, tradition calls upon *prayaschita* (reparation) commensurate with the karma. Rallying behind the slogan *[‘satyameva jayate’](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satyameva_Jayate)* (‘truth alone triumphs’), regaining own inner certitude and advising Clooney to defrock before they resume the next round of dialogue would be a good beginning on that path, and dharma and the whole world will be behind him.****  
  
svasti,  
 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,
