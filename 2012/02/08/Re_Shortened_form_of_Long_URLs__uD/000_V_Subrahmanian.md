One suggestion is that when we have to send long URLs it is advisable to send instead a 'tiny URL' for various reasons, one of which is that it is elegant and easy to handle and copy further. This can be got in a moment's time by using this free facility online: 

  

<http://tinyurl.com/>

  

For example, this is the tiny form ( obtained from the above facility)

  

**<http://tinyurl.com/6tfo87j>**

  

The original Long URL for this tiny URL is:

  

<http://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/%E0%A4%B8%E0%A4%AE%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%AD%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B7%E0%A4%A3%E0%A4%B8%E0%A4%A8%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A6%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%B6%E0%A4%B2%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%96%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%83>

  

  

Maybe many are already aware of this facility.
