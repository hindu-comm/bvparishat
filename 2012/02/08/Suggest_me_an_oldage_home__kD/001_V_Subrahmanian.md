Namaste. 

  

I am not sure if this forum is the appropriate place to discuss this topic. Yet I give a reply here:

  

An Old Age Home is run by the Sringeri Sharada Peetham at Sringeri in a nice manner. Two persons known to me are residing there. It is very affordable. Pl. get in touch with one of my friends who resides there whose phone number I shall give you in your email id. He will give all details. I shall also talk to him in advance to tell him that you will be contacting him.

  

Regards,
