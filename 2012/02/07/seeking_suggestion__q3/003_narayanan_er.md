Dear friend,

Teaching any subject or language through any media of language is a question of proficiency and practice. The proficiency is achieved through indefinite practice. The denial of Sanskrit medium to teach Sanskrit may be due to the lack of practice. If one starts to feel that English or any regional dialect is adequate enough for the conveyance of what is to be taught, naturally he will feel to use the same dialect for affluence in speech. There are people who like Sanskrit and culture but are unable reproduce what they learnt in Sanskrit medium. The solution is to attract such people to get their responses in the media of Sanskrit. For a large extent all the regional dialects are harming Sanskrit indirectly, whereas Sanskrit is enriching them in one way or the other. You start to convey anything in Sanskrit medium only. Then those people will be compelled to speak Sanskrit at least on time of teaching. Once they start practising, they will feel to become proficient in it. Then they will fell confidence in them and ultimately the problem will be solved. The initiation can be started from students too, as they can stop speaking Hindi, Urdu etc. while they discuss Sanskrit related subjects. At the same time they can carry on Hindi, Urdu etc. in the mushaira / poetry meetings as well. Best of luck.

Regards,

Narayanan
