dear Sanskritist,

Namaste.

  

my simple question is: if teacher denies to teach sanskrit through Simple sanskrit medium instead of regional languages in which they teach for years, what urgent steps are required to handle this kind ofrigidness of those teachers.

please guide us (students).

thanking you
