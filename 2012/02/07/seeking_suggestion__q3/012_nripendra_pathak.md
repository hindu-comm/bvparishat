Sir, thank you for your comment....

I really need to find a better solution to "promote future generation of Sanskrit Scholars" and to encourage "college students who want a bypass to runaway from Sanskrit learning just because 'they think ' that Sanskrit learning is difficult".... if playersdeny practicing on the field, the can not win the tournament..... If doctor does not treat aparalyzed person by doingphysiotherapy,paralyzedpersoncan not stand up at all... all students should write and submit their paper in Sanskrit, try to present the paper in front of Scholars.... Scholars must encourage them... and of course try to rectify their language mistake (softly... so that they canrealizethe mistake).

I thank you for giving me one beautiful suggestion to keep the session separate for the language learning students...

we will request our paper reviewers to give the suggestion on language and content separately.we will give to importance to the content of the paper and select the paper... when the students (whose paper is selected) will send their camera ready paper, they will correct the language as well.

in this way we can serve to purpose... we can encourage Sanskrit language learning and produce good research papers through the conferenc......
