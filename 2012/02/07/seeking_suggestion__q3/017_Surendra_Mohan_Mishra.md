Dear Madam Mrs Malti ji,  
In Mauritian situation one can have Sanskrit with English as language  
of the question papers and for Diploma papers only simple Sanskrit  
could also do as the same is put up in Hindi medium.  
The base has to be prepared and it will take some time with constantly  
pushing up the scope for Sanskrit.I am happy to see that now the MGI  
has started celebrating the Sanskrit day on Vasant Panchami.Recently  
perhaps they have started doing this on the birth anniversary of Prof.  
Bisoon Dayal who fought for the propagation of Sanskrit and Gita in  
the island before and after independence.  
It is better that teachers improve their ways than students coming up  
with a demand or  
grievance.  
Warm regards,  
SMMishra
