respected Sir,

pranam.

at present, I am involved in organizing Sanskrit Students' Conference on 9-10Oct2012 in Sanskrit medium.... I am trying to motivate the students for improving Sanskrit language to express themselves at any platform.... the other students are saying that I am doing injustice with those students who are reading Sanskrit through Hindi medium.... when I requested them to understands the uniqueness of this conference, they are creating maximum possibleresistance byreferring the WSC and WAVE conference where other languages are also allowed.... our motive behind the Sansktit Students conference is to give an exclusive platform to the Students where the competition is between the students...they are not going to compete with the Scholars of different fields... byencouraging this kind of studentscompetition, we can find the future generation of Sanskrit Scholars in india....

my motive is clear in my mind... and I request all Sanskrit Scholars to help us in creating a Central Core Committee ( a group of Sanskrit Students' from all institutes i.e. traditional and modern), Advisory committee ( of Sanskrit Scholars for theirguidance)and Review Committee (Scholars' committee to evaluate the full paper's submitted for selection).

  

I had raised the issue of Sanskrit teaching method in modern college system to get an idea for motivating Students to create a Sanskrit environment in their department... by doing this they can do practiceof speaking Sanskrit and try to express their view in Sanskrit.... 

  

To support the Sanskrit medium in class room as well as in Students' Conference I have discussed the following points with our friends in JNU ( who are forcing me to keep other languages to find a bypass to run away from Sanskrit medium):

  

  

I am giving an internal evidence to support our demand:  
1. Phonetics is the sole of Sanskrit language.  
2. If we do not get opportunity to hear out teachers speaking Sanskrit, we can not learn to pronounce Sanskrit words correctly.  
3.we can not gain vocabulary of Sanskrit.  
4. we can not develop our style of speaking Sanskrit in an impressive way.  
5. we spend our valuable time with our teachers, if we are not gaining a communication skill from our teacher than what we are gining???  
6. If teachers are not talking in Sanskrit with themselves, whom the students will follow???  
7. If we are not forced to write and practice Sanskrit writing skills, should we not ask our teachers to force us towards a creative task of submitting our assignments only in Sanskrit and present our papers in front of our own friends during paper presentation???  
8. If we will not indulged ourselves in this little harder task, can we ever write and speak Sanskrit fluently???  
9. can anybody get the capability without indefinite practice???  
10. can a Master of parsian say that he is capable of reading and understating aupnikhat ( the translated version of upnishad by Darashikoh), thus he is the Master of Sanskrit language.... just reversing the question: If you have no command on parsian can you understand and express the content of upnikhat through original one ???  
11. without knowing the language, how one can say that he or she is the student of that subject???  
12. the importance of language learning is zero???  
13. If no cricket tournament will be organized, why players will practice???  

14. If we are organizing a Sanskrit Students' Conference just like cricket, our players are misguided by some students saying that they have right to play "gilli danda " on the same ground where cricket is being organised!!!!  
  
I could not sleep well for three days as I have to create a platform for Sanskrit Students and I don't want to give a weak foundation to this platform.... to maintain the stander of this plalform, we (12-15 students of Sanskrit Centre) feel that foundation Should be very strong...we want to do this experiment to creat a platform for "searching future generation of Sanskrit Scholares in India".

we the students' of the conference of this organizing committee pray to our present generation Sanskrit Scholars to bless us by guiding and supporting this pure cause....

I request each and every member of this bvparishad group to give their view on this post... whenever they have time to read this mail.....

thanking you.

Nripendra
