My dear Sri Nripendra,  
I congratulate you for your venture.This is how our seers and sages'  
wishes regarding the eternal nature of Sanskrit will be manifest.Did  
Bhartrihari not say : davii vaag vyavakiir.neyam as'aktair  
abhidhaat.rbhi.h ?Did Pata\~njali not say : na mlecchitavai na  
apabhaa.sitavai ? And did Richard Briggs of NASA not surmise that  
Sanskrit ought to be the lingua franca of the globe in future ?  
I very well remember that we five students made a venture like this in  
1978 in Bhubaneswar in our postgraduate studies when our medium was  
was English in the classes and in the exams we could adopt either  
English or Sanskrit.We started a Vaagvaadinii Pari.sad on thursday  
evenings after the dept closed and it did have an impact with about  
80-100 students gradually coming up for the exercise of practicing and  
relishing Sanskrit with their tongues.Our Professor ,who was a great  
teacher, came to know of this and called us and said that he was not  
against Sanskrit speaking but that the event should be organized in  
the dept premises in the presence of the teachers.We obliged but in  
the meetings we had the strict rule that within the scheduled time  
nobody would speak anything other than Sanskrit.This was something  
that was done before organizations like Sanskrit Bharati came up to  
popularize Sanskrit speaking.Happily many of our respected teachers  
who did not speak Sanskrit earlier started conversing freely in  
Sanskrit.But I tell you that whatever we did was never at the cost of  
our high esteem for our revered teachers !  
As I know the best scholars with in depth study of a s'aastra is  
highly equipped with the intricacies of the language of  
Sanskrit.Padas'aastra(grammar),Vaakyas'aastra(Miimaa.msaa =  
linguistics) and Pramaa.nas'aastra(Nyaaya=logic) were basically meant  
to master the language in its entirety and only then did one take up a  
particular discipline.And how all this this is possible without being  
able to use the language as a vehicle of communication ?While speaking  
Sanskrit has a logic,not speaking Sanskrit has a lame logic.  
In the Sanskrit universities Sanskrit is apparently the medium.But how  
far this is in practice,only I can say - te hi jaananti [tadvida.h.In](http://tadvida.h.In)  
the general universities at least 50% of the questions should be in  
Sanskrit medium.So also about 50% of the teaching should be in  
Sanskrit.Some teachers may be bright even though they are not used to  
speaking Sanskrit.But if we put up the need then everybody would get  
equipped in due course.  
Professor B K Swain of Puri in Kolkata reminded me of the late Pandit  
Bhagavat Mishra of Puri who on listening to the statement that  
Sanskrit is a dead language(m.rtabhaa.saa), immediately in his  
inimitable style quipped : 'yes of course,it is so,but here is an  
example of madhyapadalopi samaasa - m.rta-sa\~njiivanii-bhaa.saa =  
m.rtabhaa.saa' !  
Sanskrit is the only language subject in which question papers are set  
in another language and answers offered in another language.Firaq  
Gorakhpuri,Harivansh Rai Bacchan and Bhishma Sahni etc taught English  
but wrote in Hindi.Being Sanskrit students and teachers nobody is  
snatching away your right to be multi-lingual or the right to your  
dear mother tongue.But that should not be an impediment to your doing  
justice to the language you are supposed to study,teach and profess.  
So Mr Pathak,I wish you all success in your endeavor.But please do  
take care and proceed with a deep sense of responsibility.  
With best wishes,  
SMMishra
