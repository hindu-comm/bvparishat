I had been for long watching the topic under discussion turning out to dictating the best method of teaching for Sanskrit Language to be adopted by the teachers:

Here is the comparative merits and demerits of both the Direct and Indirect Methods of L2 Language Teaching. Here a note by me I don't know for how many Sanskrit is a L1 in India itself, leave along in Foreign countries! I mean when a child learn to speak, the language he learns is the L1 as far as I am concerned and all other languages are L2, 3 and so on in terms of usage. So the answer lies in the status of Sanskrit irrespective of inclination of people students and teachers' emotional and ideal based however. I am not undermining the great Cultural and Literary heritage of Sanskrit Literature has endowed with to the Indian Languages.
