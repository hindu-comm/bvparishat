Sraddhaaspadeshu,

Namaskar!

A learned colleague of mine is interested in procuring a copy of \`\*  
Sringarahata\*' -- a compendium of four texts that includes the Bhaana of  
Shudraka, namely Padmaprabhrutaka. This is believed to be published in 1960.

Any pointer as to where a soft/hard copy of this could be available is most  
welcome.

Thanks much, and  
Best regards,  
-ram.
