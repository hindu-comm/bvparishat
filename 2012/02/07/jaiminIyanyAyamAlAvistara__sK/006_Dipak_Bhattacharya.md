I do not know if the following will help.  

An edition of four bhaa.nas was published in Leiden around the sixties edited by late Dr. Schokker. I did not find any copy of it at our University library but there must be one at the BORI and the Baroda O.I.  

There was a phD thesis on the Caturbhaanii (a coined name)in the eighties at the Visva Bharati. The candidate has long left the University and the first supervisor died in 1983. I might try to see the PhD these in the Visva Bharati library but that will not help as it was only a study.

Best
