Thanks to those colleagues who advanced help. But the search led to Gretil alone as capable of yielding a downloadable version. I had already got it on my own. Gretil's problem is its own characters which look hideous to us. Searching something is anything but easy.
Subramaniam Swami's Taittirīya Brāhmana type file formats would have helped more. They are perfectly legible though not very helpful for printouts.

Best wishes
