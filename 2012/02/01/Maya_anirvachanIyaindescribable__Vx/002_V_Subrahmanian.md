Sir,

  

I am truly surprised by this coincidence. Even as you were posting this, I was looking for the meaning of the word 'योगमाया’ as it appears in the BG 7.25 (योगमायासमावृतः). I was thinking of this with reference to the other thread by Sri Jeevothama on the various meanings of the word 'yoga'. 

  

For the above compound word Shankara comments:

  

योगः युक्तिर्घटनं सैव माया योगमाया, तया समावृतः संछन्न इत्यर्थः ।

  

There is said to be a female deity too called 'yogamAyA'. Is this ultimately a personification of the above referred yogamAyA?

  

Further, in the SrImadbhAgavatam in the context of KrishnAvatAraH there occurs a 'yogamAyA'

यदूनां निजनाथानां योगमायां समादिशत् \[१०.२.६\]

who is 'brought' from Nandagokula to be replaced in the cell of Vasudeva-Devaki. This deity has several names such as 'shAradA', ’कुमुदा’, माया, नारायणी’, etc. as per this chapter itself.
