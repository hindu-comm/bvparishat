Maya (अनिर्वचनीय)(indescribable)  
  
सन्नप्यसन्नाप्युभयात्मिका नो भिन्नप्यभिन्नाप्युभयात्मिका नो।  
सांगाप्यनंगाप्युभयात्मिका नो महाद्भुताऽनिर्वच्नीयरूपा रूपा॥  
(विवेकचूडामणि:)  
  
It is not sat \[real\], not asat \[unreal\], not both. It is not bhinna  
\[different\], not abhinna, \[not non-different\], not both. It is not  
sanga \[with parts\], not ananga \[without parts\], not both. It is very  
wonderful and of a form which is inexpressible.(speechless).  
H H SrichandrashekharaBharti swaminah explined in comentry on  
ViVekachoodamani(Sanskrit):  
In the world, reality of what is never sublated and the unreality of  
what is sublated are wellknown as is the case with truth and  
falsehood. What is never experienced at any time by anybody is unreal  
as in the case of the horns of a hare or of a skyflower etc. By shruti  
and smrti texts like bhUyashcAnte vishvamAyAnivrttih \[svet.\];  
taratyavidyam vitatAm hrdi yasminniveshite! YogI mAyAmameyAya tasmai  
vidyAtmane namah !! mAmeva ye prapadyante mAyAmetAm taranti te \[B.G.\];  
“again at the end, i.e., after sravana, manana, nididhyasana, there is  
the cessation of cosmic mAyA”; “I bow to that vidyAtman namely  
Brahman, who dispels may when he is lodged in the heart”, and “those  
who seek refuge in me cross this mAyA”, its \[mAyA’s\] being annulled by  
jnana is understood. Therefore, it is not possible to associate  
reality with it like the reality of the atman. According to the Gita  
statement: nAbhAvo vidyate satah: “there is no non-existence for what  
is real”, it is clear that it cannot be real as it ceases to exist  
after the dawn of jnana. Before jnana arises, as it is seen in the  
form of its effects and of their transformations, as it is also the  
subject of inference, it cannot be said to be unreal like the horns of  
a hare. It is not of the nature of both i.e., it is not both existent  
and non-existent as existence and non-existence being opposed to each  
other, it is not proper to predicate them in one and the same place.  
As it cannot be each of these separately, its being of the nature of  
both is absolutely impossible. In respect of objects seen in a dream  
and of those produced in jugglery, they are said to be of the nature  
of mithya as they disappear even as they are seen. Hence they are said  
to be different from the sat and asat, the real and the unreal. So too  
is it with mAyA. For it is said in the Gita: nAsato vidyate bhAvah  
nabhAvo vidyate satah! Ubhayorapi drSTo’ntastvanayostattvadarshibhih!!  
“Of the unreal there is no being; of the real there is no non-being.  
Of both these the truth is seen by the seers of the essence”. If to  
origination and non-existence by destruction of what has come to the  
absolute sat and asat has been declared by Lord himself who said that  
the fact of these, that the superlatively real cannot be non-existent,  
and the absolutely unreal cannot become existent and that has been  
determined by the seers of Truth. Thus also, this mAyA is not a  
sadvastu \[real\], it is not an asadvastu \[unreal\] and it is not both  
\[real and unreal\]. As it is not possible to determine if it is real or  
unreal, it is indescribable \[anirvacanIya\]. As it is not capable of  
being stated to be real or unreal and so is called anirvacanIya, so  
too it is said to be anirvacanIya also for the reason that it cannot  
be said to be different or non-different from Brahman. If it is said  
to be entirely different from Brahman, that will conflict with the  
shruti-texts intimating non-difference. In the world there is absence  
of difference between a power and the possessor of that power. But if  
it is said to be non-different from Brahman, difficulty will arise as  
it \[maya\] is liable to destruction while Brahman cannot be sublated in  
any of the three periods of time. If it is said to be both different  
and non-different, that will be to indulge in a contradiction. The  
real and the unreal are opposed to each other, relate to different  
periods of time and it is not right to predicate them together in the  
same place. Therefore, it isnot of the nature of both what is real and  
what is not real. Hence it means it is not different, it is not non-  
different; it is not both. Similarly, it is beginningless. So, it is  
without parts. For, if it is with parts, it must be said to have  
originated. But if it is said to be without parts, its evolution \[into  
things of the world\] cannot be asserted. Hence, it is not without  
parts. It cannot be both as both cannot be affirmed of a thing in the  
same context. Hence, as between reality and unreality, difference and  
non-difference, being with parts and being without parts, nothing can  
be predicated of mAyA. Hence it is anirvacanIya, indescribable. It is  
of a very amazing nature.
