My sincere thanks,. dr Bhat! In fact I normally transact from and to Yahoo. If it had been gmail I would have automatically known. Yahoo presents each mail separately and without the sender replying in trail of the recieved mail the thread is lost. Gmail presents them as a going on. Withpout denying gmail's merit, I find it a bit cumbersome for saving a document while yahoo is less so. Hence the preference. In any case, while thanking you for letting me know about the interesting goings on, I shall try to remember that the threads would be available in gmail for me and desist myself from embarrassingthe correspondent.

  
Best wishes  
Sincerely  
Dipak Bhattacharya
