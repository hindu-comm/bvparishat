Dear Prof. Bhattacharya,

  

I don't know the problem in seeing this thread. Anyhow for your convenience, I am reproducing the three messages in the earlier ones here in order:

  
Subject:Re: परिभाषा

  
  

> ननुपूर्वपरनित्यान्तरङ्गापवादानामुत्तरोत्तरं बलीय इति सत्यामपि > परिभाषायां परान्नित्यस्य बलवत्त्वेऽपि परान्नित्यं बलवदिति परिभाषान्तरं > कुत आरब्धम्? पूर्वादिपरिभाषया नित्यस्य कृताकृतप्रसङ्गित्वं नास्ति > वा?  
> नारायणः।

  

2\. reply by Vishnu Namboodiri:

  

Those are not seperate from the paribhasha-purvaparanitya.....it is  
just the quoting of a portion in question of taht long paribhasha.(the  
form of grah in lung lakaara is agraheeth).



  

Though the relevant part of the query is answered, the highlighted portion is the point taken up in Narayana's reply again:

I could not understand how both of these forms came into the query with any direct relevance. I tried to somehow to explain what Vishnu Namboodiri wanted to do with his suggestion (though I could not see the wrong form used by Naraynan anywhere in this thread). I don't think Narayanan could not understand the form अग्रहीत्, but only it could not be derived from the verb he had in mind गृहू ग्रहणे.

  

The relevance of both these forms to the topic raised in the first post is not clear for me. Hope Vishnu Namboodiri and Narayanan would answer this as both are concerned with it. The issue raised in the first post had already been answered in the next post by Vishnu Namboodiri in his reply.  

  

This is the whole content of the thread which I had replied. Hope this is visible to you in a single message.

  

I apologize for the typo error in retaking form given as wrong by Narayanan

  

  
इति क्र्यादावपि उभयपदी धातुः, ग्रहणार्थ एव वर्तते यस्य परस्मैपदे लुङि रूपं तैरुपात्तम्, अघ्राक्षीत् इति विरूपापेक्षया साधु रूपम्, अनर्थान्तरं च।

  

The one quoted was अग्राक्षीत् by Narayanan which is correct into अग्रहीत् by Vishnu Namboodiri.

  

Hope this makes clear the discussion referred to in my message if you can read this message also. Otherwise I am helpless.

  

With regards
