Subject: \[Advaita-l\] A treasure of Lectures in Sanskrit  
To: [adva...@lists.advaita-vedanta.org]()  
  
  
A friend of mine, Dr. Ramanujan, who is the Group Coordinator of Indian  
Heritage Group at CDAC Bangalore, has produced a number of videos in  
Sanskrit on many topics, including Advaita Vedanta, Mimamsa, Nyaya, Yoga,  
Alamkara, etc. The URL is:  
  
<http://ihg.cdacb.in/ihg/tarkshya_presentation.aspx>  
  
Click on "Video Lectures" (near the top) and select the topic to view the  
video.  
  
The Advaita Vedanta talks are by scholars from Mattur. Also interesting is  
a video on DarsheShTi and agnihotra conducted at the same place.
