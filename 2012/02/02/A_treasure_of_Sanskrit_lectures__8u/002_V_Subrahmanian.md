I guess they are all in Sanskrit. Surely VyakaraNa lectures will be in Sanskrit and Nyaya and even by seeing the titles of the lectures we can be certain that they will be in Sanskrit alone.

  

See another post that I have just forwarded to this group which has a
link to a lot more lectures in Sanskrit on a variety of disciplines.
