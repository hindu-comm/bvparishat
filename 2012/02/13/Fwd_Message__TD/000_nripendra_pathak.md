***Dear friend Pathak,***  
  
*** We the students from Department of Sanskrit studies, University of Hyderabad are reading and writing everything in English only ( viz. dissertation & Thesis also). Even the faculty staffs are communicating and teaching in the same language, then how a student can write an article properly in Sanskrit without any error ??? Is it possible ??? Students are not getting proper scope for that. If no faculty will speak that language then how a student can learn the same ? The medium of instruction is English here. I am very shameful to express you this thing.
