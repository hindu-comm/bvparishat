Respected Sir,

Namaste.

I thank you for your support and blessings to us.

I want to add that I am working under Dr. Girish Nath Jha. My area of research is Sanskrit Computational Linguistics andSpecifically Sanakrit Hindi Machine Translation.

My M.Phil. topic was "Challenges in Sanskrit Hindi Noun Phrase Mapping". I am waiting for Viva of the Same. My Ph.D topic will be decided after my M.Phil Viva.

As a researcher in Conling, I feel lack of the Sanskrit language during my study. this is the reason, I started doing Sanskrit movement right now.

I just want to add oneincident... I saw a 7 years old Sanskrit Scholar to whom Prof. Saroja Bhate Mam said "bhavaana tu mamapi guruH" when the boy told her that he has already memorized Astadhyayi fully.

  

see you soon.

thanking you

Nripendra
