Mr. Pathak,

I totally agree with your views. No regional dialects should not be a tool to write Sanskrit language research papers and theses materials. If we analyze any Hindi poetry or prose in research point of view in Hindi language it could totally be acceptable. But if some people do it in either Tamil or Gujarati or Bengali, then surely we say that it is not support the Hindi language. The same scenario is happening with Sanskrit for years. Nobody prefer the original texts in Sanskrit rather than the English translations. If Universities demand theses' in English of the content which is either related to Sanskrit language or the material composed in Sanskrit language, the candidates compel to prepare the same in English. Later on the pendulum of medium of instruction even for Sanskrit also swung on to Hindi in the northern belt of India; whereas in southern parts English prevails. All these trends are against Sanskrit. In National level there it started a slight deviation to such trends when the Institutions like the Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan (thanks to Professor R K Sharma et al), the Rashtriya Sanskrit Vidyapeetha, Tirupati, Shri Lal Bahadur Shastri Vidyapeetha, New Delhi etc. started propagating Sanskrit as medium of instruction and exams. In many of the colleges in south India Sanskrit departments were cornered like anything like the other dialect departments. Thirst and hunger for awards, posts, monitory gains paved the way for side-lining Sanskrit. At present the number of people who can understand original Sanskrit texts in India has declined considerably to below one thousand. This could hardly be one percent in comparison to other languages? How will we change this scenario? Stick to Sanskrit, learn it throughout your life whether you are employed or not, whether you are poor or rich. Use Sanskrit idiom when you use Sanskrit. Don't mix up with English or Urdu or Tamil terms while you talk Sanskrit. Think in Sanskrit while you use it; forgetting all the dialects including your mother tongue momentarily. Then that could be the success for Sanskrit. All the best, Mr. Pathak, all the best.

Regards,

Narayanan
