Dear Scholars,

  

Namaste...

I have already mailed you everything in my earlier mails in this regard....

I just want to add that

1\) the logic which is given in favor ofregional languages as analternative with Sanskrit studiesis not acceptable at all.  
2) If Sanskrit Students through out the country can not write Sanskrit research paper in Sanskrit language, than it is the failure of Sanskrit education system and teachers are responsible of all these failures because they can teach in Sanskrit language as they are teachers of sanskrit centre/dept., not a teacher in the Indic Study dept or Indology dept.

  

3\) Either they should exclude Hindi as a medium of Education or they must rename the department as 'Indology Dept." instead of "Sanskrit Dept".  
  
please give your opinion in this regard.

  

  

With regards,

Nripendra
