By co-incidence, a publication probably complementing A.D. Pusalker's work came to my notice a few minutes ago:

  

# Pradeep, index to felicitation and commemoration volumes : Dr. Pradeep Mehendiratta felicitation volume /

New Delhi : Manohar : 1991  
American Institute of Indian Studies

  

Even if the above turns out to be very useful, updating of last twenty years' f. and c. volume publications will be a worthwhile undertaking.
