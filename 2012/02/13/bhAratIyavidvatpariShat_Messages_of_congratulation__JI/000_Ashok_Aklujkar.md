I am not against a person informing the list members something like the following: "I successfullydefendeda thesis titled XXX at YYY university on ZZZ day" or a "A book/article I have recently published has the following contents." In the former case, summarising the conclusion(s) will also be of general benefit as some BVP member has already suggested.

  

Since there have been observations to the effect that the theses at Indian universities tend to cover the same ground again and again, the information about what a particular thesis covers will serve to reduce the extent of duplicated research. Such information is to be welcomed as is the information about new publications and their contents.

  

My objection to 'floods' of messages of congratulations is of a piece with my view that felicitation and commemoration volumes should not contain too much material praising the subject of the volume in a non-specific, personal way. Focused evaluations of what the subject professionally achieved are fine. Inclusion of personal information to the extent it has a bearing on the professional achievements is also fine. In the context of Sanskrit, a few poetically striking tributes make sense, too. However, afelicitation and commemoration volume that devotes dozens of pages to tributes or details of personal life that do not advance the knowledge in the field should not be, as far as possible, produced.

  

The last thought reminds me of a serious desideratum in the field with which the BVP is concerned. After A.D. Pusalker's (?) \_Index to papers in commemoration volumes\_, published as[Issue 5 of the Post-graduate and Research Department series](http://www.google.ca/search?tbo=p&tbm=bks&q=bibliogroup:%22Post-graduate+and+Research+Department+series%22&source=gbs_metadata_r&cad=3)by the[Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute](http://www.google.ca/search?tbo=p&tbm=bks&q=inauthor:%22Bhandarkar+Oriental+Research+Institute.+Post-graduate+and+Research+Dept%22&source=gbs_metadata_r&cad=3)in 1963, no helpful tool in tracking the research articles in felicitation and commemoration volumes seems to have been published. On the other hand, a large number of such volumes has been produced, particularly in India. If the BVP members could volunteer to post, as they find time, lists of the articles found in the f & c volumes accessible to them, we will soon have a powerful (easily searchable electronic) research tool in our hands. The emerging document should not be held back by the consideration that it may repeat the information in the BORI publication, for the information in the latter is not comprehensive or easy to consult. Further, a specific sequence in entering the bibliographic information must be adopted, and some young and competent scholar(s) must act as a co-ordinator, but I do not think these will present any major hurdles.
