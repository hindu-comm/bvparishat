dear anilji, I congratulate for your efforts and love for the  
language. Sanskrit language needs your services further.

But I dont think BVP is forum to share the news of your ph.d viva. I  
am afraid that this might become a model for others to share that news  
which is not a good for bvp however welcome it might be. bvp should  
not be flooded by this kinds of news. bvp is only for discussion and  
news related to sanskrit language.
