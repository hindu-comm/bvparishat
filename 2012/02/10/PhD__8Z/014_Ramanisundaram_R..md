Dear Sirs,



I am not an active contributor to this blog. I read every positings, comprehend the same and use it appropriately. I am a Senior Citizen, retired but not tired.



This blog is for a specific purpose. If any good news that should be celebrated is announced, I suggest the Moderator can add a word of appreciation / congratulation / nice words and confirm that this thread need not be pursued further. If any Scholar would like to send any message still, it can be done through their personal eMail ids. It is my humble suggestion. Regards. R. Ramanisundaram\*
