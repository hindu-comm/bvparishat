Dear Dr.Anilkumar,

  

Heartiest Congratulations on successful completion of Ph.D

At Madras University.

When possible as per rules of the University, you should

publish your thesis as a book so that more people can be benefited by your research.

  

You can also post a summary of the thesis in this forum

or in The Astrological Magazine where your seminar was covered

in one of the issues.

  

With Warm Regards

  

Ramachandran M
