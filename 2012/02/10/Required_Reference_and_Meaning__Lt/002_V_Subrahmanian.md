Thank you Sir for the reply. The meaning you have given is not very clear to me. Could you kindly elaborate? Are the three Brahmaa, ViShNu and Shiva stated as the three forms of the One Entity? What are 'वेधा’  and 'धातुः' ?  Is Kalidasa here talking about the Trimurti-s as essentially One but only manifesting as different?

Is no reference available for this verse? Also, 'sharvaH' is a name in Vishnusahasra nAma too. So, is the above sentence said by Shiva to Vishnu or vice versa? Or is the verse / sentence said by someone other than Shiva and Vishnu to someone else?

  

Sir, is there any reference to Buddha/Buddhism/their practices, etc. in Kalidasa's works?

  

Thanks. 

  

Warm regards,
