Namaste.

  

These two quotes are found in a Tamil Book titled 'श्रीगुरुकृपाविलासम्’ (part 2) \[A book on HH Sri Chandrashekhara Bharatai SwaminaH of Sringeri)where the Acharya says these in conversation with a devotee:

  

एकैव मूर्तिर्बिभेदे त्रिधा सा सामान्यमेषां हि परावरत्वम् ।

  

विष्णोर्हरस्तस्य हरिः कदाचिद्वेधास्तयोस्तावपि धातुराद्यौ ॥

  

\[The above is said to be from 'kAlidAsa'. The below is also uttered by the Acharya later:

  

आवयोरन्तरं नास्ति शब्दैरर्थैर्जगत्पते

  

I request the learned members to inform me the source of the above quotes and the meaning of the first quoted verse.

  

Thanks and regards,
