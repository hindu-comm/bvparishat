In either case, the purpose of the verse doesn't change. In Sahasranama you can find all other epithets of Shiva also equally applied to Vishnu:

  

सर्वः*शर्वः शिवः*स्थाणु: भूतादि: निधि:-अव्ययः ।

संभवो भावनो भर्ता प्रभवः प्रभु:-ईश्वरः ।। ४ ।।

स्वयंभूः शम्भु: आदित्यः पुष्कराक्षो महास्वनः ।

  

Whereas in lexicons these are epithets of shiva:

  

शम्भुरीशः पशुपतिःशिवः शूलीमहेश्वरः ।

ईश्वरः शर्व ईशानः शंकरश्चन्द्रशेखरः ।।१-१-३०।।

भूतेशः खण्डपरशुर्गिरीशो गिरिशो मृडः ।

मृत्युञ्जयः कृत्तिवासाः पिनाकी प्रमथाधिपः ।।१-१-३१।।

उग्रः कपर्दी श्रीकण्ठः शितिकण्ठः...  
  

The other epithets also could be used in respect of Vishnu also in respect of him in any verse describing him also. The same applies to those epithets of विष्णु used in respect of verses praising शिव also. But generally the epithets as listed in lexicons are to be taken denoting the ones they are listed (from the general usages - not specific usages). Like the attributive words used as substantives, शिव is commonly used to denote auspicious one, and ईश्वर the lord (of the world) without any specific reference to any deity even शम्भु is literally means शं भवत्यस्मात् इति शंभुः। There is a common maxim used "योगाद् रूढिर्बलीयसी" which is acceptable unless there is any specific context restricting it to the derived meaning. Otherwise popular meaning is accepted. I don't remember anywhere the word शम्भु or शिव used as epithet synonym to विष्णु and also the word विष्णु (though meaning व्यापनशील equally applies to any godly concept) is not used in respect of शिव. The purpose of सहस्रनाम is to describe the different attributes of the deity whether it be शिव or विष्णु and can share many attributive epithets of each other. But this is not the same in the cases where there is no context specified. In the absence of the other speaker, the verse need not serve the same purpose it is interpreted in the first place. (it may by anyone speaking either identification with Shiva or Vishnu \[here I use these in the common sense in which they are used\] as the case may be.  

  

This is my personal opinion. One may differ as to the application of the योगाद् रूढिर्बलीयसी.
