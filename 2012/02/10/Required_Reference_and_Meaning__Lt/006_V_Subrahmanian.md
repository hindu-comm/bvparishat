Dear Sri Sivasenani,

  

I am very happy to see this detailed explanation presented by you. As you have rightly speculated the सा is a reference to the मूर्तिः, form which is the saguNa Brahman.  I am reminded of another verse of the mAdhavIya shankara vijaya verse last line: शंभोर्मूर्तिश्चरति भुवने शंकराचार्यरूपा ...  
  
As an aside, the 'Trimurti' concept seems to have been well established and in vogue during the times of Kalidasa, as we see from the verse and the explanation. And that Kumarila Bhatta too has quoted Kalidasa tells us how Kalidasa's works have influenced Indian Philosophical thought.  
  
I am also reminded of another verse of the SrimadbhAgavatam in the context of Daksha yagna:  
  

श्रीभगवानुवाच

अहं ब्रह्मा च शर्वश्च जगतः कारणं परम् ।

आत्मेश्वर उपद्रष्टा स्वयंदृगविशेषणः ॥५०॥

आत्ममायां समाविश्य सोऽहं गुणमयीं द्विज ।

सृजन् रक्षन् हरन् विश्वं दध्रे संज्ञां क्रियोचिताम् ॥५१॥

\[Brahmaa - sRiShTi, VishNu - sthitiH, Shiva - samhAra\]  

तस्मिन् ब्रह्मण्यद्वितीये केवले परमात्मनि ।

ब्रह्मारुद्रौ च भूतानि भेदेनाज्ञोऽनुपश्यति ॥५२॥

यथा पुमान्न स्वाङ्गेषु शिरःपाण्यदिषु क्वचित् ।

पारक्यबुद्धिं कुरुते एवं भूतेषु मत्परः ॥५३॥

त्रयाणामेकभावानां यो न पश्यति वै भिदाम् ।

सर्वभूतात्मनां ब्रह्मन् स शान्तिमधिगच्छति ॥५४॥

  
(IV.7.50 – 54)

(50) *Lord Vishnu said: 'I, Brahmâ and Lord S'iva as well, do not differ in being the supreme cause and Supersoul, the witness and the self-sufficient one of the material manifestation.* *Him the Supreme Brahmân that is without a second, is as one Supersoul with both Brahmâ and S'iva, but the living ones who are not conversant with this, think of them as being separate.* (53) The way a person sometimes does not make a difference between the head, hands and other parts of his own body, so does *My devotee thus make no difference between living beings. (54) He who having the one nature of the Three, verily does, of the Supersoul in all beings, not see the separateness, o brahmin, realizes the peace.'*

  
  
Would someone inform about any Buddhistic references in Kalidasa's works?   
  
Thank you once again for the painstaking presentation.
