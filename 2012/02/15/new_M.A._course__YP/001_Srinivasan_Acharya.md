ॐ तत् सत् - नमांसि  
Dear Sir/Madam,  
  
We are glad to hear that Master degree is also offered in translation studies that enhances the beneficial exchange of valuable resources between the known and unknown languages. I found few of the western Universities offering this particular course, while some of the Indian institutions are offering only the diploma. I did not find any of the information regarding this through Internet, neither in the UOP-CASS website. I request you to share the information regarding the questions are mentioned below:  

-   Is this course offered through regular stream only or offered
    through correspondence also? -   If through correspondence, the details of study centres -   Do you have any plans to share with any of the other academic
    institutions to offer this degree to the interested who are not able
    to attend the regular stream? -   Is there any limits of age? -   What are the subjects are taught? -   Is there any elective options? -   What are the languages that are focused in this study?

I thank you for the effort to bring this course that would portray the value of our language and our nation.

Thanks and Regards,
