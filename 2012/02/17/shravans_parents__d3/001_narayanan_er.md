Dear Mr. Patel,

In think the Valmikiramayana does not mention about the names of the parents of Shravanakumara who was killed by Dasharatha, as the story is in the Ayodhyakanda. There might be some Buddhist manipulation to the story by naming the unnamed. A few Jataka-Attakathas might been seen like that, as Sita, Rama and Hanuman were interpreted in different ways in such works. The names like Shantavana as the father and Jnanavati as the mother of Shravanakumara in some hindi story books too. For instance :

Title: Shravan Kumar, Author: M. I. Rajasvi, Hindi Title: *श्रवण* कुमार, Hindi Author:

There is link for this story : <http://pustak.org/home.php?bookid=3927>

It depends upon the freedom of writing. Namings to the unnamed from the writer's imagination.

Anyway, I don't know whether the Ramayanas like Kampa, Tulasidas are naming Shravanakumara's parents or not.

This is only my limited perception. Scholars of vast reading in many dialects can find out where since the naming started etc.

Regards,

Narayanan
