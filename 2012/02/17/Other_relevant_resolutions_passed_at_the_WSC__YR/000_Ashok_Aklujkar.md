Members of this forum should also be aware of the following resolutions passed in the General Assembly held at the 15th World Sanskrit Conference. They should lend a helping hand and try to create conditions that will lead to the execution of the resolutions. It is of crucial importance in the current situation that Sanskritists and Sanskrit-lovers should unite and stay away from quibbling over wording or expressing disagreement over whether resolution X is more important or resolution Y. An all-round effort backed by a show of unity is needed for several years to come.

  

Texts of the resolutions:  

  

The General Assembly of the International Association of Sanskrit Studies (meeting during the 15th World Sanskrit Conference) strongly recommends to the Government of India to establish a Sanskrit Commission that would update, complement and continue the work of the first Sanskrit Commission of 1956.

--------------------

The General Assembly of the International Association of Sanskrit Studies (meeting during the 15th World Sanskrit Conference) congratulates the Government of India on its establishment of the National Manuscripts Mission. At the same time, it requests the Government of India to lift the temporal limit it has placed on the existence of the Mission by including it within the five-year plans.
The multitude of manuscripts in India is too great to allow their coverage within limits such as five or ten years. New texts are coming to light practically every year. The daunting task of making a comprehensive list of the possible copies, in private or public collections, of manuscripts once known to have existed has yet to be begun. Published catalogues of major collections, being outdates in most cases, do not give the full picture. It is very important for the dissemination of knowledge and the meaningful application of manuscript content to modern contexts, in particular for scientific claims and patents of India, that manuscripts should be located, preserved and studied on a continuing and permanent basis. Only a sense of certainty given to the Mission will create the multi-talented work force that the very nature and condition of the manuscript treasures of India require.

----------------------

The General Assembly of the International Association of Sanskrit Studies (meeting during the 15th World Sanskrit Conference) urges the Government of India in the strongest possible terms that every step helpful in preserving the institutions of Sanskrit learning (Oriental schools/colleges, pāṭha-śālās, tols, etc.) in the provinces and centrally administered territories of India should be taken as early as possible. In many places, these institutions have either closed or are on the verge of being closed, especially in the provinces that have restrictive language teaching policies in the case of primary and secondary schools. It is of crucial importance to the unity of India and preservation of Indian culture that as far as possible such developments and their consequences should not be allowed to take place.

-----------------------

The General Assembly of the International Association of Sanskrit Studies (meeting during the 15th World Sanskrit Conference) urges strongly that the Sanskrit language should be given a major place in the school curriculum in every state of India up to +2 level. Students should be given the opportunity to study Sanskrit at upper primary, middle secondary and senior secondary school levels. Possibilities should be explored of teaching Sanskrit also at the primary level in schools. A board consisting of competent members should be constituted by the Government of India to look into the proper functioning of Sanskrit Oriental education in the country.

----------------------------

The General Assembly of the International Association of Sanskrit Studies (meeting during the 15th World Sanskrit Conference) urges that the HRD Ministry of India should take an initiative to conduct classes in Sanskrit abroad (at least in major cities of Europe, USA and elsewhere). There should be opportunities for Non Resident Indians and foreign nationals to learn Sanskrit language and literature, apart from the existing departments currently offering certificate courses. Such arrangement should be made available with the help of HRD ministry and external affairs, Govt of India.
