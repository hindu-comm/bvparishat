This is a view presented by Bhavabhuti in his Uttararamacarita and the commentators commentators explain it by quoting समांसो मधुपर्कः - and the scene continue to the question of Janaka who optionally had abandoned the eating of meat. and the point is discussed passingly in the scene.

  

And the same is immediately taken up by Murari, also in his line:

  

तत्तादृक्तृणपूलकोपनयनक्लेशाच्चिरद्वेषिभिः

मेध्या वत्सतरी विहस्य वटुभिः सोल्लुण्ठमालभ्यते॥

  

The two year old calf is butchered (for the guests) by the pupils in the Ashrama of विश्वामित्र and they take revenge the difficult that they suffered by bringing large stacks of grass for feeding the cow.

  

The commentator quotes smRti for this also:

  

वत्सतरीमारणं चातिथावागते विहितमेव -

"महोक्षं वा वत्सतरीं वा दद्यादतिथये गृही।" इति स्मृतेः। रुचिपत्युपाध्यायः।

  

This point had been discussed long ago in this forum for some length: 33 posts on vegetarianism in ancient time:
