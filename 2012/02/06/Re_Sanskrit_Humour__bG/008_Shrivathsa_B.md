hariH OM,  
  
 What I have read in a book "a review of beef in medieval India"  
<http://www.panjabdigilib.org/webuser/searches/displayPage.jsp?ID=2931&page=1&CategoryID=1&Searched=>  
is that the calf or the ox was given away to the shrotriya and the explanation that the calf / ox was butchered is not acceptable mainly because:  

1.  Arghya, pAdya, Achamana, madhuparka all happen one after another in
    quick succession, hence not permitting the fancy of a calf being
    killed, its meat being mixed into a milk preparation etc. etc. Hence
    giving away of a cow (to do which is much quicker) appears logical. 2.  There is no evidence in any of the top restaurants (as surveyed by
    the authors of the abovesaid book "a review of beef in medieval
    India") of a sweet preparation being made out of meat. Hence the
    explanation of meat being mixed into a sweet, milk based preparation
    is again untenable.  

 There are many more explanations given in the book.
