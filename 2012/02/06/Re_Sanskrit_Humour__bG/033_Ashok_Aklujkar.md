A cunning श्वशुर had taught this to his दशम ग्रह:

दधिमधुघृतधारा क्षीरसारप्रवाहः

How is it?

By the last sentence, I suppose you mean 'how the verse is to be understood,' not 'whether the verse is charming or not'.  
  
I take the verse as teaching that a son-in-law should not overstay his welcome in the house of the father-in-law. Three days, five days, at the most seven days is okay. Enriching and sweet foot items (curds, honey, ghee, butter) will be served incessantly (pravaaha) and the son-in-law will be pampered in the house of the father-in-law. Even one day beyond the specified limit may lead to the use of a chappal (slapping) or shoe (kicking out) -- a stark reversal of the earlier treatment.  
  
In printing, there should be a space between yadi and bhavati and tad-upari and dinam. The space between -dhaaraa and k.siira- should be removed.  
  
The verse seems to be a relatively recent composition, 19th or 20th century.
