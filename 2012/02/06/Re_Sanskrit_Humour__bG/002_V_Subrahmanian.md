Thank you Sir for the reply along with valuable pointers. I shall make a few observations in the sequel:

Does this show that killing of cow for food was permitted, even in 'Ashrama-s'?

Here is a verse from the above work as I heard rendered by a few eminent scholars of Advaita Vedanta:

  

’मत्तविलासप्रहसनम्’ -

  
वेदान्तेभ्यो गृहीत्वार्थान् यो महाभारतादपि ।  
विप्राणांमिषतामेवकृतवान् कोशसञ्चयम् ॥  
  
Mahendravarman in his work 'mattavilAsaprahasanam' says this about the coming into being of the Buddhistic system:  
  

//Taking material from the UpaniShads and also from the MahAbhArata (which includes the BhagavadgItA), Buddha, even as the brAhmaNa-s (vaidika-s) were wide awake, accomplished a great fortune - literally filled up his coffers - (of establishing a vibrant system).//

Sri Vidyaranya Swamin makes use of the above maxim in his Jivan mukti viveka.

Very true. I have heard about a humourous verse in Sanskrit, the meaning of which is:

  

The teeth chide the tongue: You have the practice of uttering vile things and retreating to the safety of the inner quarters. It is we who have to face the wrath of men who vengefully retort: 'I shall dislodge your teeth'. 

  

I would like to read this verse.  I think the 'kali viDambanam' of NilakanTha Dikshita too contains verses filled with humour.
