In the English-speaking world (including India where it is applicable), it is a criticism - a very damaging one, I might add - when somebody is accused as not having a 'sense of humour'.

  

I found the situation in Sanskrit-dominated world to be different. Humour is seen as a vikaara of Sri\~Ngaara, and not befitting of a dheera-naayaka. Some observations like that of the naayaka in 'chalaapaangaam drishTim..." etc. \[1\] might pass off as appropriate self-deprecation, with a touch of subtle humour in English literature, but not so in Sanskrit. In short, humour does not get the same place of honour as in English literature. Most situations which give rise to humour - such as anga vaikalyam and troubles of a person - are not supposed to be a cause of joy. Technically, they ought to be para.peeDanam, the cause of paapam and enjoyment from such situations has to be seen as a lower form of enjoyment.

  

One recollects Yogasutraवितर्का हिंसादयः कृतकारितानुमोदिता लोभक्रोधमोहपूर्वका मृदुमध्याधिमात्रा दुःखाज्ञानानन्तफला इति प्रतिपक्षभावनम् ॥2.34॥ Though there is no direct linkage with ahimsaa in our present discussion, the point about 'approval of himsaa' also being seen as an obstacle in the practice of ahimsaa, shows how trouble for others is not a valid cause of joy or mirth in the Sanskrit-speaking world.

  

In the form of Vidushaka we do have enough humour, but it has to be seen as a lesser form of entertainment. The highest form is that joy which comes Sringara, Karuna, Vira etc. Many aalankaarikas hold Sringara as the highest rasa, sometimes the only one. Anandavardhana gives vipralambha Sringaara and Karuna a very high place, whereas Bhavabhuti holds Karuna to be the only rasa.

\[1\] This is from the first act of the play, Abhij\~naanaSaakuntalam. King Dushyanta in this verse comments that a honey-bee is more successful than him the king, as the bee gets to a) catch the complete attention of Sakuntala, b) whisper like a close friend in her ear, and c) taste the nectar of her lower lip.
