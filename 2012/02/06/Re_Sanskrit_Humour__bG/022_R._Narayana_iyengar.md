There are different shades of humour, some subtle some not so, bordering on the crude. But all this depends on the taste of the 'Rasika'. Invariably "aalamkaarika" statements in Mhaakaavyaas are uniformly enjoyable. By'humour' at present many would think aboutPG Wodehouse, TP Kailasam and similar authors. As I understand such 'prahasana' works are not many in Sanskrit. May be they will arise in future. But my perceptionis, Sanskrit peoplewere never devoid of humour. Even in the Rigveda 5th Mandala croaking of frogs at the onset of the rainy season is compared humourously withstudents repeating mantras.



I recollect a funny incident from my Pathashala daysmore than50 years ago. In the Kaavya class we had to identify each and every word by its linga, vachana, vibhakti etc. That the word 'manas' is always in Neuter was very humourously taught:



नपुंसकमिति ज्ञात्वा प्रियायै प्रेषितं मनः ॥

तत्तुतत्रैवरमतेहताःपाणिनिनावयं॥



Someone asked what about 'manas' of ladies ! The Aachaarya said substitute प्रियायat the right place!

Thanks for the links. The second one is quite interesting. It shows  
how  
versatile the authors have been and how Sanskrit gives itself to  
versatility.
