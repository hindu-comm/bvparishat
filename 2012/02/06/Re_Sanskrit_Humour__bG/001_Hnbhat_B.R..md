I think there is no separate division of literature dedicated to the collection of jokes to cut on any occasion. But one can compile from the vast literature used in different occasions.

  

For example, "मडमडायिता गौः" in उत्तररामचरित suggests the killing of the cow when a guest is at the heritage and the pupils are happy there will be "anadhyayana" day for them to enjoy.

  

So there are many plays under the ten divisions of रूपक-s like भाण and प्रहसन etc. amplifying with humourous episodes contributing to their अङ्गिरस. though in all the plays विदूषक is always present with his jokes entertaining the hero as a companion. This is the venue of हासरस predominant in the Sanskrit Literature though there are certain works. One of them is by Kshemendra - नर्ममाला a sort of blue literature in Sanskrit with humorous episodes.

The popular प्रहसन of Mahendravarma is मत्तविलासप्रहसन an ancient play. and शृङ्गरभाण of Bhattabana.

  

The maxim

  

न हि भिक्षुकाः सन्तीति स्थाल्यो नाधिश्रीयन्ते! न हि मृगाः सन्तीति शालयो नोप्यन्ते!

  

Evidently make fun of precautionary measure anticipating possible danger. It cannot be that no body refrains from cooking, fearing the beggars would come nor no body do not sow paddy fearing the animals would eat them. Only when the beggars come or the animals come, one can chase away them. But it is a foolish thing to refrain from cooking or sowing seeds for fear of them.  

  

Though तुन्द्रिलमैथुनन्यायः, अर्धजरतीयन्यायः also well have their own contribution to humorous sense they are accepted as Nyaya-s for their face value.
