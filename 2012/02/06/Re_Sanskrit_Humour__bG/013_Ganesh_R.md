Many scholars are already in tune with the topic. Hence my humble input may be rather tiny:-) In spite of this being marveled by the richness of humor in Sanskrit literature am just citing few books/articles here:  
1.Comic element in Sanskrit by Dr. V. Raghavan  
2.arvaacheen samskrita saahitya by S.B. Varnekar ( this is a Marathi book and I my be wrong in giving the exact title of this as too long ago I had read it)  
3.aadhunika Samskrita saahityadalli haasya (a long article in Kannada penned by my self )  
4 Samskrita saahityadalli haasya by Gargeshwari Venkatasubaiah  
There are many other articles/booklets in English, Kannada, Hindi and Telugu as well.  
5. Prahasana in Sanskrit Literature by S. Ramaratnam.  
6. BhaaNa-vaaGmayacaritam by K.V.Ramakrishnamaachaarya (in Sanskrit) (Dr. S.S. Janaki also has done a study o this topic and am not aware whether tat is published or not)  
Apart from these, many many original works are available. A few significant are:  
bhavadajjukiyam, latakamelakam, aagamadambaram, haasyaarnavam, somavalli yogaanandam, caturbhaaNi (the best edition of V.S.Agravala and Motichandra are unforgettable), kuttaanimatam (especially the commentory of Tansukharam Manasukharam Tripathi is wonderful), samayamaarukaa, deshopadesham, darpadalanam, kalaavilaasaH, many plays of mahaligasaastry of Tamilnaadu (like kaundinyaprahasanam, srngaaranaaradiyam)sunakashatakam and vaidyopahaasakalikaa of R. Shankar, srngaarayaanam, asmatcampU, and gaalishatakam of Areyyar Sri Ramasharma, many dutakaavyams like the kaakadutam, moghadUtam, sunakadutam and the like, many works of S. Jagannaatha ( incidentally
he is the author of Moghadutam. his another work alamkaarapankiyam and the recent satirical play on resurrection of Sanskrit)........thus the list is end less...if the author is interested to contact me over phone, i can give much more information as it is too long to type:-)
