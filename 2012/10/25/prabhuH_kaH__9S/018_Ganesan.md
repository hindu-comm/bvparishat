As an example, the Haripaksha vyaakhyaana of Madhusuudana on the 8th verse is clearly shown to be "far fetched" and "क्लिष्टकल्पना", which is simply nothing but "text torturing". What more proof do you want ?

Then to show that "you possess enormous qualities in interpreting a text as widely as possible", and "to make Jayadeva free from forcing any one explanation on his composition" write an "error-free" interpretation on Dashaavataarastotra as applying to Siva.
