hariH OM,  
shrii gaNesan,

  
  
"But we cannot conclude on the basis of this commentary that the author of the Sivamahimnastava also intended to praise Vishnu."  

1.  It is very difficult for mere mortals to get into the shoes of
    mahaamatis to know what they actually intended. 2.  Many a time, the kavi isn't even aware of the "other" meanings that
    his words convey. Unless he does a TippaNa of his own work and
    restricts the meaning to one among several interpretations, an
    honest seeker may interpret it in whatever light he sees it. Let us
    not get stuck in the interpretations of "honest" etc. madhusUdana
    sarasvatii's interpretation is "honest" insofar as it doesn't seek
    to denigrate any deity and doesn't seem to be maliciously
    motivated.  
3.  Moreover, if what a kavi writes is restricted to one artha, it shows
    the poverty of the language. The shivamahimna stava can be
    "avirodhena" interpreted as many things because it is such an all
    encompassing stava. ruciinAM vaicitryAdR^ijukuTila nAnApathajuShAM
    nR^iNAmeko gamyastvamasi payasAmarNava iva. Somehow the audArya of
    the stava seems to be missing in your discourse.
