I need not list out "the offending points" in the hari-para Tiikaa; The very motive behind embarking upon interpreting such an OUTRIGHTLY and AVOWEDLY SAIVA TEXTS (add also the interpretation of Srii Rudram, etc. by Madhva acharya-s) as hari-para itself is nothing but "colonising".  
The question of "offending" any one's sensibitilies does not at all arise here.  
  
As I had written in my earlier post, What is sought to be achieved by such interpretations ??  
  
I am putting forth the views on hari-para vyaakhyaana and analysing its merit/demerits. It is purely an academic one.  
Do not colour them as "offending my personal sentiments/sensibities". If you try to drag those views into a personal level, there is no point in continuing the discussion.  
  
Unless it is agreed that the entire hari-para vyaakhyaana is "far-fetched" and amounts to "text torturing" with a subtle motive to propagate VaishNava views through the medium of a widely popular and authoritative SAIVA TEXT, there is no point in continuing the discussion.  
  
Ganesan
