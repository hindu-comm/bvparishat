Generally the tradition holds that the 'kumara sambhavam' of Kalidasa has the '...जगतः पितरौ वन्दे पार्वतीपरमेश्वरौ’ to mean Shiva-pArvati couple. Even if we do not know what Kalidasa had in mind, that it is this couple alone is not in doubt.  
  
In the vyAkhyA for the 8th verse: महोक्षः खट्वाङ्गं परशुर्जिनं भस्म फणिनः कपालं ...Madhusudana first takes the yathAshruta pATha परशुः अजिनम् भस्म फणिनः...as the insignia-s of Shiva, bhasma=पांशुः (dust), फणिनः = सर्पाः.. But in 'haripakSha vyAkhyAnam' he takes these two words, for example, as ’भस्मफणिनः भस्मवच्छुभ्रस्य किमलाङ्गस्य च फणिनः शेषस्याऽजिनं शरीरत्वक् खट्वा शय्या । तथा कपालं = कं शिरः पाल्यतेऽनेनेति कपालम् शिरउपधानं तस्यैव भस्मफणिनोऽङ्गं किंचिदुच्छ्रितावयवविशेषः.. In hara paksha what was a nominative plural, in haripakssha becomes a compound possessive singular. Also one can see how he goes back and forth in the 'yathAshruta' pATha to derive the haripaksha meanings. In my opinion the haripakSha meaning is derived क्लेशेनैव whereas the harapaksha comes सुखेनैव. Also from the way Madhusudana says for the first verse तत्र हरपक्षे *यथाश्रुति* व्याख्यातम्, हरिपक्षेऽपि तदेव योजनीयम् । संबोधनपदं *तु*  
अहरेति ।...and the pattern for all shlokas of first taking up the harapaksha and only next the haripaksha it is clear that he himself saw that the stuti is primarily intended as shivastuti and/or there is a tradition/prasiddhi to that effect even at his time.

The question is 'valid for whom?'. For example the 'tattvamasi' is explained in twenty different ways, all said to be grammatically error-free, by the Dvaita school, each giving a different but non-advaitic meaning. All these are valid for that school and not for Advaita.

I agree that the Shiva bhakta-s will not be really affected by a Vishnu-para explanation of this stuti. But is there any tradition that holds the Shivamahimna stuti as a stuti of Vishnu? Do Vaishnavas hold this as a stuti of Vishnu? Is this stuti recited in Vishnu sannidhis? I am not aware. But it is said that throughout the country this stuti is sung in Shiva temples and by Shiva bhaktas.
