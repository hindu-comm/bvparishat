hariH OM,  
shrii gaNesan,  
  
 Please do not open a different front when you haven't been able to convince anyone about the first front.  
  
 When shrii madhusUdana sarasvatii has given hara para and then given hari para interpretations, you are hell bent on questioning his motives (of him being a viShNubhakta and somehow viShNubhakti being contradictory to shivabhakti etc.).  
  
Coming to your new front:

  
"it also proves that Madhusuudana " does not know (न जाने) the NirguNa Brahma", which Samkara never misses an opportunity to inculcate and establish in all his Upanishad Bhaashya-s (at many places where it appears uncalled for)."  

Let us be specific. Mention those places where nirguNa brahma has been "inculcated" when it was "uncalled for". Simplistic white-washing will not do.  
  
Moreover, nirguNa brahma, is always the knower, it can never be the known. hence what you have mentioned here (madhusUdana sarasvatii not "knowing" nirguNa brahman) is not in tune with upaniShadic thought. Moreover, at times you call yourself just a "normal" mati, whereas here, you are trying to get into the shoes of madhusUdana sarasvatii. Please spare us Sir.  
  
If you want to continue this discussion, please choose a stotra / stava of your choice and write a simple Tiikaa on the shivamahimna stava, if not the whole stava, at least one of the verses. Then and only then you may go over to reviewing madhusUdana sarasvatii. Consider this to be an open challenge to you.
