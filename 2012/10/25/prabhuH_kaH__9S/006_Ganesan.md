Dear Misra,  
My explanation about Kalidasa's view of Supreme Brahma is for your following statement:  

  
*Though as is clear from Kumarasambhava 2.6, Kalidasa sees Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva as three aspects of the same Brahman.  
*  

It is also an explanation for कः प्रभुः ? raised with reference to the Manusmriti verse: the Supreme God became half-male and half-female, which applies (on the basis of Sruti) to Siva, as we do not hear of any other aspect of Brahma becoming so.  
  
*In a lighter vein, for रामाश्रयीs like me, पार्वती and परमेश्वर are both बहुव्रीहि compounds. पार्वती = पार्वती + ई = पार्वत्यां ई शोभा यस्याः सा पार्वती = सीता and परमेश्वरः = परमः ईश्वरः येन = रामः. Hence पार्वतीपरमेश्वरौ = सीतारामौ. :)*  
  
One can have many such explanations but they can only be secondary and can be termed as the result of "Colonising the ancient Saiva concepts". There are many such instances, and to cite a well-known one, the commentary of Madhusuudanasarasvati on the ancient Sivamahimnastava, where he explains the verses as applying to Vishnu also, which is due to his devotion to Krishna.  
But we cannot conclude on the basis of this commentary that the author of the Sivamahimnastava also intended to praise Vishnu.
