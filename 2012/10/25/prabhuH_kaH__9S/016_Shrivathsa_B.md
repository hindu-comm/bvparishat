hariH OM,  
shrii gaNesan,  
  
 If you want any further discussion on this topic, please delineate those interpretations of madhusUdana sarasvatii which have caused offence to you. madhusUdana sarasvatii has given two interpretations and at times three showing us how various meanings can be derived out of the stava. He has done so without showing any particular inclination towards an interpretation (just like an honest observer). He has not challenged the shivaparatva of the stava while giving the hariparatva.  
  
 please find my responses to your points below:

  
  
"Those "mahaamati-s" have to be understood and interpreted only by our normal 'mati-s.'"  

 Then please give enough space and benefit of doubt. Don't talk so cock-surely.

  
  
"In the case of the Sivamahimnastava, the author does not say he is composing a Kaavya to show his erudition; on the contrary, propelled by high Bhakti and as he can conceive (svamatipariNaamaavadhi), he begins to recount the Greatness (Mahimaa) of Siva, who he considers as the Supreme Reality. He states in the very first verse in its fourth paada"  

 avirodhametat. I submitted to you that what he may have said about shiva doesn't preclude the stava applying to some other deva. If the bhakta of the other deva wants to derive another meaning, he should be free to do so.

  
  
"3. If one wants to show that he has so much "audaarya" as defined by you, then, even the Dashaavataarastotra of Jayadeva (another mahaamati)
or the liilaa-s of Krishna portrayed in the 10th skandha of Bhaagavata can be interpreted as applying to Siva even if there is no 'maliciousness' in such interpretations !!!"  

 Oh! that will be splendid. Those will be welcome additions to our literature.

  
  
  
"It is only due to Bhakti he has "started this impossible venture of delineating the incredible greatness of Siva"  
If one tries to interpret Hara also as applying to other Gods like Vishnu, etc., then there can only '' avyavasthaa'-- unceratinty-- and anybody can interpret any word as one likes and resort to text torturing which can definitely not be the actual sense the author wanted to convey. "  

 here you are trying to torture the text! varada can mean shiva as well as viShNu. What i submitted to you was: What puShpadanta said was about hara, it doesn't stop anyone from interpreting it as referring to one's own iShTa.  
  
"If it is said still it is possible to interpret in various ways as one likes "in order to show \[as one likes\] the 'richness of the language' , that can never be called an interpretation or vyaakhyaana. Instead it will be only an occasion to show one's mere scholarship and much worse, using a text to prove one's own beliefs and reading completely different views in a text which its author would never have intended. As I said earlier, it is nothing but colonising a text or a view to establish one's own beliefs."  
 Sir, the language is already rich. It will not become richer if we try to, and vice versa. You have totally misunderstood what i told you. What I told you was: because the language is so rich, it lends itself to various interpretations. Else I and you should be talking in machine language consisting of zeros and ones, or something like a programming language. The richness of the language helps interpreters interpret any text in their own ways and satiate their urge to see the nirguNa nirAkAra etc. in the form which they wish to see it.  
  
 Lastly, verses like "tvamApastvaM vyoma, tvamu dharaNirAtmA tvamiti ca" etc. applies to brahman which permeates everything. If you prefer to see this brahman as shiva, so be it, if you prefer to see it as viShNu, so be it.

  
  
" Yes. The poet unambiguously and clearly says that "Siva is the final and supreme Reality reached by the followers of all other systems such as Veda, Samkhya, etc."  
The paths are many, but the supreme goal reached by all of the is Siva.  
Evidently, one cannot interpret in any other way in order to get certified as "rich in audaarya".  

You have interpreted it as Shiva, it is good for you. For another who wishes to interpret it as nArAyaNa, narasiMha etc. let them do it. If you were convinced about the above interpretation, you wouldn't term the interpretation of other verses as "hijack" etc.  
Some interpreters are not udaara, it doesn't mean that the stava itself is anudAra. No matter what you say, this verse has given license to interpreters to interpret bhagavaan in their own way, inasmuch as they are reaching a single destination.

  
  
svasti,  
 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,  

shrivathsa.
