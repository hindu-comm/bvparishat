I think we should not be deliberating too much on this. Tradition holds the Shivamahimna stava of Pushpadanta to be a work on Lord Shiva only.
For that matter an Acharya of the Madhwa school has written a Vishnu-para commentary on the Sri Rudram which tradition however holds as Shiva-specific alone. Just because there is a Vishnu-para commentary to these popular Shiva stutis the prasiddhi that exists in tradition will not be affected. Thus one can say a commentator has only tried to do a stuti of his IshTa devatA in writing such off-the beaten track commentaries.
