1. Those "mahaamati-s" have to be understood and interpreted only by  
our  
normal 'mati-s.'  
2. In the case of the Sivamahimnastava, the author does not say he is

\>\> \*Though as is clear from Kumarasambhava 2.6, Kalidasa sees Brahma,  

\>\> Vishnu and Shiva as three aspects of the same Brahman.  

\>\> \*  

\>\> It is also an explanation for कः प्रभुः ? raised with reference to the  
\>\> Manusmriti verse: the Supreme God became half-male and half-female, which  
\>\> applies (on the basis of Sruti) to Siva, as we do not hear of any other  
\>\> aspect of Brahma becoming so.  
\>\>  

\>\> \*In a lighter vein, for रामाश्रयीs like me, पार्वती and परमेश्वर are  

\>\> both बहुव्रीहि compounds. पार्वती = पार्वती + ई = पार्वत्यां ई शोभा यस्याः  
\>\> सा पार्वती = सीता and परमेश्वरः = परमः ईश्वरः येन = रामः. Hence  

\>\> पार्वतीपरमेश्वरौ = सीतारामौ. :) \*

\>\> One can have many such explanations but they can only be secondary and

\>\> Krishna.  
\>\> But we cannot conclude on the basis of this commentary that the author of
