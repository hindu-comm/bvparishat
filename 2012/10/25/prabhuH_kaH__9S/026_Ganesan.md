It is too well-known to Advaita Vedanta scholars that Madhusuudana Sarasvati (circa 16th century) a formidable Advaita teacher and a great polemic, has defended the core views of Samkara's Advaita Vedaanta in his Advaitasiddhi from the virulent attacks of Dvaita Vedanta represented mainly by Vyaasatiirtha. In the process he had strongly defended the basic Advaita views on Maayaavaada, NirguNa brahmavaada, etc. and he is considered to have established them on sound logical base.  
Such a person who has devoted so much of his logical skills to prove the ultimate reality of NIRGUNA BRAHMA (and evidently accepting the lesser and vyaavahaarika reality of SAGUNA BRAHMA), finally states,  
  
कृष्णात् परं किमपि तत्त्वमहं न जाने ।  
That too, the Krishna who is "वंशीविभूषितकर, etc." who is fully with form and with so many attributes !!  
From this verse, it is established beyond any doubt that Madhusuudana believes (knows-जाने) only the SaguNa Brahma in the form of Krishna and conversely, it also proves that Madhusuudana " does not know (न जाने) the NirguNa Brahma", which Samkara never misses an opportunity to inculcate and establish in all his Upanishad Bhaashya-s (at many places where it appears uncalled for).  
  
How to justify or interpret the ambivalence and total contradiction in the views of Madhusuudana ??  
I think the very praamaaNikatva of Madhusuudana as an ardent follower of Samkara's Advaita is under question.  
  
I am sure many of the Advaita scholars will be offended by my frank views.  
But never mind !!  
  
Ganesan
