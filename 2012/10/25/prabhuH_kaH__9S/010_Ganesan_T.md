Shrivatsa,  

1.  Those "mahaamati-s" have to be understood and interpreted only by
    our normal 'mati-s.' 2.  In the case of the Sivamahimnastava, the author does not say he is
    composing a Kaavya to show his erudition; on the contrary, propelled
    by high Bhakti and as he can conceive (svamatipariNaamaavadhi), he
    begins to recount the Greatness (Mahimaa) of Siva, who he considers
    as the Supreme Reality. He states in the very first verse in its
    fourth paada  

 ममाप्येष स्तोत्रे हर निरपवादः परिकरः ।  

where Hara means only Siva which is a basic fact known to 'aabaalagopaalam'. The same in each succeeding verse.  
In the 31 st verse also he says,  
  

कृशपरिणति चेतः क्लेशवश्यं क्व चेदं

क्व च तव गुणसीमोल्लङ्घिनी शश्वदृद्धिः।

इति चकितममन्दीकृत्य मां भक्तिराधाद्

वरद चरणयोस्ते वाक्यपुष्पोपहारम्॥  
  
It is only due to Bhakti he has "started this impossible venture of delineating the incredible greatness of Siva"  
If one tries to interpret Hara also as applying to other Gods like Vishnu, etc., then there can only '' avyavasthaa'-- unceratinty-- and anybody can interpret any word as one likes and resort to text torturing which can definitely not be the actual sense the author wanted to convey.  
If it is said still it is possible to interpret in various ways as one likes "in order to show \[as one likes\] the 'richness of the language' , that can never be called an interpretation or vyaakhyaana. Instead it will be only an occasion to show one's mere scholarship and much worse, using a text to prove one's own beliefs and reading completely different views in a text which its author would never have intended. As I said earlier, it is nothing but colonising a text or a view to establish one's own beliefs.  
  
3. If one wants to show that he has so much "audaarya" as defined by you, then, even the Dashaavataarastotra of Jayadeva (another mahaamati)
or the liilaa-s of Krishna portrayed in the 10th skandha of Bhaagavata can be interpreted as applying to Siva even if there is no 'maliciousness' in such interpretations !!!

  
  
"ruciinAM vaicitryAdR^ijukuTila nAnApathajuShAM nR^iNAmeko gamyastvamasi payasAmarNava iva."  

Yes. The poet unambiguously and clearly says that "Siva is the final and supreme Reality reached by the followers of all other systems such as Veda, Samkhya, etc."  
The paths are many, but the supreme goal reached by all of the is Siva.  
Evidently, one cannot interpret in any other way in order to get certified as "rich in audaarya".  
  
Ganesan.
