Tradition of those who know only one explanation holds such thing.  
Moreover, who knows the original author meant to propitiate shrI-viShNu at the same time or not ?  
Until error is shown in an explanation, it is granted valid. This is how svataH-prAmANyam of vedAntin-s and mImAMsaka-s work and observed by all.

Traditions of people following different explanations of veda-s, as advaitin-s, vishiShTAdvaitin-s and others are not affected by explanations of others. So, is the tradition of followers of different explanations of mahimna-stuti-s.  
Let them live freely. Why favor any one ?
