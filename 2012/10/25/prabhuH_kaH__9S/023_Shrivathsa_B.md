hariH OM,  
gaNesan,  
  
 shrii madhusUdana sarasvatii hasn't said that the hari-para interpretation is the only interpretation. In fact, he gives the hara-para interpretation first, thus acknowledging the obvious.  
  
 It is you who seeks to straitjacket madhusUdana as a "hijacker" and "colonizer". I repeat, he hasn't said that the hari para interpretation is the only interpretation.  
  
 Moreover, your insistence on attributing motives to madhusUdana without telling us which of the Tiikas of the shlokas offend your sensibility shows your discourse in a poor light.  
  
 Until you give us the specific Tiikas of shlokas which amount to "hijacking" or "colonizing", there is no use continuing this discussion.

  
  
svasti,  
 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,  

shrivathsa.
