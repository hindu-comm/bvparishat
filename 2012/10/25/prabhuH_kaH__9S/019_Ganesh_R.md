I have heard that Sri MadhusUdanasrasvati wanted to set an example of  
hariharaabhEda by composing unique commentaries on shvamahimnasstOtraM  
and geethagOvindaM so that the respective shivapaaramya nd  
viShNupaaryamya of these texts may also be taken for an exchange!  
However, I haven't yet come across this commentary on the  
geethagOvinda.  
  
Many such stories are alluded around the great personalities. It is  
said that the famed love poem amaru(ka)shatakaM is penned by the great  
sage-scholar-philosopher Sri sankarabhgavatpaada and later it was  
explained in terms of vairagya and vEdaanta! I have heard, but not yet  
come across, that such a commentary to it is in real existence. Just  
by the power of vyaakraNa and tarka one can do any thing and every  
thing in Sanskrit language. But the intentions behind that along with  
the repercussions of the same in the stream of vast space and time  
are very important.
