Sir,  
  
I agree with you especially on the portion highlighted by me above. For example, in the famous Shvetashvataropanishad mantra 'एको देवः सर्वभूतेषु गूढः.....केवलो निर्गुणश्च’ the revered Acharya of the Madhva school, Sri Vadiraja Tirtha in his 'Yuktimallika' has suggested an alternative reading: केवलोऽनिर्गुणश्च by adding an avagraha. The intention is clearly to preclude the implications of the word 'nirguNa'.
