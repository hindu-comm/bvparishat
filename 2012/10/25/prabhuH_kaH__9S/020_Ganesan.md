Coming to a larger question,  
What is sought to be achieved by such interpretations (of Sivamahimnastava as applying to VishNu, of interpreting the Srii Rudram as applying to VishNu, etc.) which texts are CLEARLY INTENDED BY THE THEIR AUTHORS AS HYMNS SINGING THE GLORIES OF SIVA AND SIVA ALONE which they have made amply clear from the very beginning of the compositions ?  
  
As an answer, I will have to come back to my earlier view, namely, COLONISING AN ANCIENT, HIGHLY REVERED AND WIDELY POPULAR TEXT as the above ones in order to advance and propagate one's own views and concepts.  
Nobody questions the right of these "interpreters" to compose any number of independent texts explaining and propagating their own views on VaishNavism and VishNU Bhakti; but when they start "thrusting their own views" on those ancient texts of authority which texts do not at all lend to support any of their views, and out of necessity resort to sheer text torturing, then the very intention of these "interpretations" become questionable.  
  
Saivism and Sivabhakti being so ancient and wide spread and possesses such authoritative Vedic texts as Srii Rudram , Svetashvataropanishad, Atharva siras, Atharvasikhaa Upanishad-s, etc., which the later authors used extensively to propagate their views on superiority of VishNu and VaishNava views. It is well known that Ramanuja extensively utilises Svetashvataropanishad, Atharvasikhaa and Atharvasiras, etc. in his Vedarthasamgraha.  
In the later period, Madhusuudana, who has gone all the way to compose such a polemic text as the Advaitasiddhi to prove "the theory of Maayaa" of the Advaita Vedanta from the attacks of Dvaita Vedaanta represented by Vyaasatiirtha but finally said कृष्णात् परं किमपि तत्त्वमहं न जाने
uses the Sivamahimnastava a widely popular text on SivaBhakti (this is one of such rare stotra texts that was inscribed as early as the 10th century on the walls of the Omkaareshvara temple, which is one of the 12 Jyotirlinga-s) to propagate VishNu Bhakti. In the process he had to resort to "klishTaartha-s" .
