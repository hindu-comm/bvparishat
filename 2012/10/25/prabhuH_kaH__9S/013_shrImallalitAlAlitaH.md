What happens to an unbiased person when he sees this as  
स्तोत्रेऽहर निरपवादः परिकरः ।

Let us make clear that interpreting any sentence according to wish is not to be blamed until it is proved text-torturing. And to say an interpretation torturing you need to show errors in anvaya(अन्वयः). If you can't show any error, you must accept that interpretation valid.

As long as errors in explanation are not shown, multiple valid explanations are to accepted. If you favor any one of possible explanations, you will be showing bias.  
And, if you can't think of other explanations, you are showing lack of qualities to do that. Moreover, to fit your view you are dragging the original author to your level when you say that he meant just this and not that.  
The best way to know the intended meaning is to ask the composer and if he is not available don't force any one explanation on him.

If errors can't be shown, then we have to accept even such explanation.

I can't see any word meaning shiva in above quoted part.
