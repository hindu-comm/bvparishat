You are absolutely right. I unmindfully commented only onthe meaning of पुरुष and later rectified by referring to प्रभु।

Dear Professor Bhattacharya  
  
I think प्रभुः is the कर्त्ता of the "अभवत्" and "असृजत्" forms (सः प्रभुः ... अभवत्, सः प्रभुः ... असृजत्). While it could be the taken as the adjective of पुरुषः in the first line (as in प्रभुः पुरुषः अभवत्), it is less likely given that महर्षि मनु has used प्रभुः in the nominative also in 1.28 for ब्रह्मा which is originally used in the nominative in 1.23 at the beginning of the description of creation.  
  
The मन्वर्थमुक्तावली of कुल्लूकभट्ट says on this verse (1.32) - "स ब्रह्मा निजदेहं द्विखण्डं कृत्वा अर्धेन स्त्रीं तस्यां मैथुनधर्मेण विराट्सञ्ज्ञं पुरुषं निर्मितवान्। श्रुतिश्च ततो विराडजायतेति।" I have not seen other commentaries and it may be worthwhile consulting them on whether they take प्रभुः as ब्रह्मा or as पुरुष.
