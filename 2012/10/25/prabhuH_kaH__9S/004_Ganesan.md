Though it is so, from the mangalasloka-s of all his works it appears to be definite that for Kalidasa Siva is the 'Parabrahma';  
as he pays obeisance to Siva-Parvati, the parents of the Universe (jagataH pitarau vande paarvatiiparameshvarau) and as the two invocatory verses of his Maalavikaagnimitram and Vikaramorvasiiyam clearly state:  
 वेदान्तेषु यमाहुरेकपुरुषं व्याप्य स्थितं रोदसी  
 यस्मिन्नीश्वर इत्यनन्यविषयः शब्दो यथार्थाक्षरः । . . . .  
  
 कान्तासम्मिश्रदेहोऽप्यविषयमनसां यः परस्ताद्यतीनां , etc.  
show, the supreme Brahma--ParamapuruSha-- according to Kalidasa on the basis of the Vedanta, is Siva, inseparably united with Paarvatii-the Ardhanaariishvara and He is the "Prabhu" referred to here.
