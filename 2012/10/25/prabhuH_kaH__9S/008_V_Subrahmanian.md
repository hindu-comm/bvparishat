There is a mention of brahmA creating manu and shatarUpA from himself and commencing the human race. Is this somehow hinted in the manu verse under discussion?  
  
When we see the Purusha sUktam, we get: तस्माद्विराडजायत. That means from that ParamAtman/Parabrahman who is said to be अत्यतिष्ठद्दशाङ्गुलम्, etc. this virAT puruSha has manifested and from this virAT the rest of the creatures manifested. This scheme does not seem to tally with the manusmRti under discussion where the virAT has been shown as born of brahmA who himself is, according to purANa-s a created one, the first-born. Or if we take the virAT a product of this first-born brahmaa, the puruSha sUkta scheme seems to be contradicting it as it shows the 'virAT' as the first-born (straight from the Parabrahman).  
  
Maybe some explanations are there in Sayana bhashya, etc. to reconcile the apparent contradictions.
