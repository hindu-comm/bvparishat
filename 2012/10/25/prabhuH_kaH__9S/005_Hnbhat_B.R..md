Mallinatha quoted the verse from Manusmriti, to support the statement जगतः पितरौ by कालिदास and the word in मनुस्मृति need not refer to शिव or नारायण, on which the question was asked.

  

स स्वयंभूः itself is the beginning of the creation in the मनुस्मृति which is अव्यक्त, then अप एव ससर्जादौ which identifies नारायण described in the आगम-s (which is not available in all the versions आपो नारा इति प्रोक्ताः --- \] etc. after the line quoted. Then it became अव्यक्त, as ब्रह्माण्ड from which ब्रह्मा, creator appeared. There is no question of शिव and विष्णु (except the interpolated verse) and there is no question of whether प्रभु is related to any of the three.
