Namaste  
  
Today I had occasion to hear a scholar quote this sentence:  
  
प्रज्ञा नवनवोन्मेषशालिनी *प्रतिभा* मता।  
I am told that it is from the 'rasagangadhara' of jagannatha.  
  
I am sure the above is already known to most of the scholars here.  
  
The word 'प्रतिभाति’ was cited by Dr.E.R.Narayanan from the Kathopanishad. I would like to extend this to another concept familiar in Advaita Vedanta: प्रातिभासिकसत्यम्. प्रतिभाति itself has the meaning 'to appear' as for example in the usage: तादृशावक़ाशलाभो दुरवाप इत्यस्माकं प्रतिभाति । (it appears to us...). There is 'प्रतिभानम्’ that comes closer to the sense of something appearing to be something else. In this sense the term प्रातिभासिकसत्यम् is used. In Advaita this category is defined as 'an erroneous appearance that gets corrected without the need for Brahman-knowledge.' A very common example would be the rope appearing to a person as a snake and when he realizes that the thing there really is a rope, the error is no more there. For the period he was under the spell of the error (thinking that the snake is there) the illusory snake enjoyed a certain reality and this is what is called प्रातिभासिकसत्यम्.  
  
I mentioned this since the original post had called for material relating to the term प्रतिभा from Vedanta (all schools) too.
