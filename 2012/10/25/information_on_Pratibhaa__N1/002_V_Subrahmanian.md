While appreciating what Dr.Narayanan has supplied, I am reminded of a sentence the Sringeri Jagadguru said recently while releasing the book 'विद्वत्प्रतिभा’ containing articles submitted by the scholars participating in the महागणपतिवाक्यार्थविद्वत्सदस्’. ’भवतामेव प्रतिभा अत्र (अस्मिन्पुस्तके) प्रतिबिम्बति’. One scholar just before commencing his talk said: ’ ....विषयमधिकृत्य यथामति यथाप्रतिभानं च वक्तुमुद्युक्तोऽस्मि.’  
  
We see various organizations honoring outstanding performers in exams through a function called 'प्रतिभापुरस्कारः’. Here the idea is that the merit of the student is recognized, appreciated and the student is rewarded for possessing/displaying such merit.
