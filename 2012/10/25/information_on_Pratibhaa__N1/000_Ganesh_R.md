Dear Scholar-friends,  
  
I am in search of original(Sanskrit and Prakrit) as well as secondary  
(English, Hindi, Kannada, Telugu, Tamil, Marathi etc.,) sources on  
Prathibhaa; its nature function, classification, implications etc.,  
Though this quest is supposed to have concentrated more on  
alaMmkaarashaastra, am very much interested to know the bearings of  
Pratibhaa in other shaastra-s like the nyaaya, saaMkhya, Yoga,  
MeemaaMsaa, Bauddha, Jaina, VEdaanta (it various schools) and the  
like.  
  
I request the scholars to help me in this regard. I want to know the  
availability of Books, Papers any research dissertations published or  
unpublished too, in this regard.  
  
  
with utmost regards  
  
ganesh
