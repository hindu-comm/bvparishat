It is clear from the सूत्र itself, as तस्य refers to स्वरित whether it be ह्रस्व, दीर्घ or प्लुत as the case may be, which is different from their स्वर.

  

I don't think anything added especially to the classification ह्रस्व, दीर्घ, and प्लुत. Also प्रातिशाख्य may not go against the पाणिनीय classification either in शिक्षा or सूत्रपाठ.

  

Thanks a log for the information on on प्रातिशाख्य-s. Even the पाणिनीयशिक्षा commonly accepted as वेदाङ्ग has different versions applicable ऋग्वेद and यजुर्वेद. A critical Edition also has appeared with different versions and two commentaries on two versions.

  

I have heard from Sriramanan, a Vedic Scholar and Grammarian, in Mahabhashya, there is some indication of these long लृ, and short ए, ओ is available. But he didn't give the reference to the शाखा in which it persisted or the location im महाभाष्य. But as available in the presently recensions, there is no long or short of these letters.

  

As notified by Nityananda, there is no clear cut understanding, where short ए ओ are used in प्राकृत, but in some verses of प्राकृताध्याय, we can see ए noted by some mark like ऎ ऒ in some verses. other than ए and ओ.
