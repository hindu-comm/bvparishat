Dear Prof. Subrahmanyam,



I have been following this thread with great interest and your citation from Patanjali seems to bring everything together in my mind. Thank you.



It seems to methat perhaps the pure a-kAra and A-kAra of Sanskrit as we know it probably was not pronouncedin a pure manneracross all regions where the veda was transmitted. Would it be fair to say that they often tended to be some version of short e and o respectively? Of course, the commentary you cite says that it is gIti-vaSAt, but I suspect that there are much more ingrained speech habits involved, even outside of a sAmaveda context.



Some contemporary examples to illustrate this: Bengali speakers tend to short e and short o instead of a and A. Of course, their Romanized spelling explicitly uses o, as in Shubhro, Joydeep etc. Tamil speakers also often do a variation of short e instead of a, in many contexts, e.g. "begu" with short e, in lieu of Sanskrit bahu. Today, the word begu is not seen much in common use except perhaps among grandmothers, but you can tell that a singer is Tamilian when the word in a Tyagaraja composition comes out as begudUrambani. When M S Subbalakshmi sings gangA-jala in her musical rendition of the bhaja govindam verses, it sounds like gengA-jala. Most Tamil people will never forgive me for saying so, I'm sure. :-)



The reason I think these are deeplyingrained speech habits is thatI've noticed them even among Indian children in the United States and I see a wide variety of them daily. The Tamil kids tend to sing "ma ge ri" instead of "ma ga ri" andthe Telugu kids say Chyagaraja for Tyagaraja and ardham for artham, although neither group of kids particularly speaks their mother tongue at home on a routine basis! They all sound generically American when they speak English.



Best regards,

Vidyasankar



ps. Minor point: In TA, where the line SukraM te anyat ... occurs, the next line is vishurUpe ahanI dyaurivAsi. Later in the aruNa praSna,there isa parallel passage with the dualforms:SukraM vAm anyad yajataM vAm anyat \| vishurUpe ahanI dyauriva sthaH \| viSvA hi mAyA avathas svadhAvantau \| bhadrA vAM pushaNav iha ...
