Regarding Short E and O.

  

Traditionally, the Veda Paatha and Samskruta Paatha consider E and O as short (Hrasva) only. However, I have come across a reference in Bharadwaja Raghaveeya Bhashyam to Panineeya Siksha.

It says that - Components of Kampa in Vedic Swaras, have Hrasva Aspects of E and O. For this, it cites a reference from Sukla Yajurveda.

(Starting a debate about fixing the number of syllables in Trishashtischatushshashtirvaa Varnaah ...), one view point derides the other.

It even lists the Deergha of Lu and provides a source in Mantra Sastra, where the usage is quite prevalent, as I have gone thru several Yantroddhaaras.



Hence, it has to be settled that Panineeya Vyaakarana system (including commentaries) have listed the widely prevalent systems of those days, leaving out less treaded paths.

Subham Astu.
