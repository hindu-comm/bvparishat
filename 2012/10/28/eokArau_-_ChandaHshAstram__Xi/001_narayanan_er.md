Dear Dr. Patel,  
  
एओकारौ हलन्तस्थौ शुद्धौ वाऽप्यपदान्वितौ। दीर्घात्परं लघू स्यातां छन्दोविचितिभाषया।।  
According to the commentary to the Chandoviciti, ए and ओ either independents, or joined with any consonants, or not adjoining with any word could be treated as laghu-s but optionally both will be work as normal dīrghas as well.  
He gives examples: तो क्खाहिशि or तो षाहिशि . Here तो representing ततः (which could be तदो in Prakrit, but has got 3 mātra-s altogether) is although having an ओ in the consonant त् to make it into 2 mātra-s, it is (ओ) treated as to make the metrical balance. There are 14 uniform mātra-s in each foot, to make a metrical form of mātrāsamakam. Breaching the metrical balance is a non-bailable offence. Thus it has been said: api māṣaṃ maṣaṃ kuryāc chandobhaṅgaṃ na kārayet. If ततः is substituted in Prakrit as तअ, there are two things, the meaning may not match that of तदो and although तअ has 2 mātra-s, might not serve the purpose. Let us check the verse:  
लामेहि अ लाणवल्लहं तो (14 mātra-s if only ओ of तो is treated as laghu)  
तो क्खाहिशि मच्छमंशकम्। (14 mātra-s if only by including तो as dīrgha repeated from previous foot)  
एदेहिं मच्छमंशकेहिं (14 mātra-s if only considering independent ए as laghu and दे consonant plus vowel as laghu)  
शुणआ मलअं ण शेवन्ति॥ (normal 14 mātra-s)  
Phonetically, ए, ओ, ऐ, औ are not heard as laghu-s because they are not hrasva-s. But the commitment to the metrical balance dominates here too. But I wonder whether there is any other options of metres rather that keeping the fourteen mātra-s intact. Rules in the Prakrit are flexible too.  
This is what I understood. I request the scholars to correct me, whether I thought wrong.  
Regards,  
Narayanan
