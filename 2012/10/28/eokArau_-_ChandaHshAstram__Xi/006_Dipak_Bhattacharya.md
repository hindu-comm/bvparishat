\<Traditionally, the Veda Paatha and Samskruta Paatha consider E and O as short (Hrasva)\>

This is not the position in the Ṛkprātiśākhya. Cf., RP. 1.14 *ojā hrasvāḥ saptamāntāḥ svarāṇām anye dīrghāḥ*. According to this *a, i, u and ṛ* are short and all the other vowels are long. This is the position taken by the Pāṇinian sampradāya too.

\<Components of Kampa in Vedic Swaras, have Hrasva Aspects of E and O\>

This does not go against *e* and *o* being long. The long kampa is formed of four parts. The total effect is the long character.

\<It even lists the Deergha of Lu\>

This, again, is un-Pāṇinian. Cf., Bhaṭṭoji Dīkṣita under *mukhanāsikāvacano ‘nunāsikaḥ* SK.9 (P.1.1.9): *tasya d**īrghābhāvāt*.
