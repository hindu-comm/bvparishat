Dear sirs,

  

I neglected to add that I own and edit a website, [www.granthamandira.com](http://www.granthamandira.com), which hosts digital Sanskrit texts in Roman transliterated form, mostly related to Vaishnavism in the Gaudiya tradition, but including many other valuable works, nearly 700 in number.

  

[www.vrindavantoday.org](http://www.vrindavantoday.org) is another web site that I own.

  

Thank you very much.

  

Jagadananda Das.
