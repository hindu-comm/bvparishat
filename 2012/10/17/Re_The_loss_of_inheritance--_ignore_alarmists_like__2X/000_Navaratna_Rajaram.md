 I agree one hundred percent that these alarmists like Sheldon Pollock should be ignored. He is not concerned about saving our inhertance but his own job. There were Pollocks, Witzels, etc in the time of Valmiki, Kalidasa etc but that didn't stop them from creating our great tradition.



 The Pollocks and the Witzels of the world are parasites created by the needs of colonial Indology. Let it die a natural death. These fellows are trying to perpetuate this colonial anachronism for their own benefit.



 Sudha Murthy (not Infosys) gave Pollock and the Clay Library some $5 mllion to bring out translations of Indian classics. Nothing has happened.



 These Indologists will no more save India than Sonia Gandhi and her family will.
