The work in this regard is commendable, no doubt. Even so, I cannot help but feel that for the one dictionary I have seen, for mathematics, it would have been better to have given equivalents that capture the correct sense of what the English term means (as is done for mathematics in French, Russian, etc.), rather than phrases with literal word-for-word equivalents. For example, very few Hindi/Sanskrit speakers would readily understand बीजीय संख्या to mean "algebraic number" (even granting that बीजगणित is a long-standing equivalent for "algebra," बीजीय may also not be the best equivalent for "algebraic").
