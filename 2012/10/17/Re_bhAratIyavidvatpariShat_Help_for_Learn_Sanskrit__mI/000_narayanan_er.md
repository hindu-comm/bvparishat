> Dear Scholars,  
> I am a silent member of the group. I have learn Sanskrit in my school > from 8th to 10th standard and that helped me a lot in my personal > Sadhana, due to which I can recite the verses of any Stotra fluently. > I have joined the group to learn from all of you, as all of you are > very scholar & great people. I take this opportunity to thank you all > of you for sharing your knowledge and you research.  
>   
> With some of friends, I am involved in in Bal-Samskar movement in > Maharashtra and we teach children some Sanskrit Stotra Mantra. We > also have contacted to some schools in Pune, the teachers are really > interested in such activities. Since long time I have been thinking to > aware school students to learn Sanskrit. As many students do not opt > for Sanskrit as a third language in 8th standard, so I feel we should > make aware them about the benefits of learning Sanskrit language.  
>   
> I appeal to all of you, if you have some charts or ready documents > relating Science in Vedic Scriptures or Management science in Vedic > Scriptures or any kind of document that will make awareness in school > going students to learn Sanskrit.
