Dear Dr. Moharir,  
Namaskar. Polyandry (Greek: πολύ—many, άντρας—man) refers to a form of marriage in which a woman takes two or more husbands at the same time. In the case of Ahalyā, not being approved by Gautama, it not to be called a polyandry, but she practices a hidden illicit action of non-contemporary social custom, unlike that of the Mahābhārata icons of Draupadī and Kuntī, the social custom well approved by Arjuna (who had Subhadrā too later on) and Pāṇḍu (who had Mādrī too later on). Ahalyā knew that Gautama will not compromise in that regard, and the disguise of Indra indicates that it is not a socially approved choice. If it would have been an approved choice of polyandry, then that would have hurt the kernel of the Rāmāyaṇa. That is why Vālmīki puts forward this through the dialogue of Ahalyā to Indra:  
अथाब्रवीत् सुरश्रेष्ठं कृतार्थेनान्तरात्मना।  
कृतार्थाऽस्मि सुरश्रेष्ठ गच्छ शीघ्रमितः प्रभो॥ १-४८-२०  
आत्मानं मां च देवेश सर्वदा रक्ष गौतमात्।  
If Vālmīki would have wanted the custom of polyandry as one of sub-themes which supports the kernel, then why this: सुरश्रेष्ठ गच्छ शीघ्रमितः प्रभो ? and देवेश, आत्मानं मां च सर्वदा गौतमात् रक्ष ? Vālmīki does not want Indra as a co-partner of Ahalyā alongwith Gautama. The curses by Gautama to Indra and Ahalyā is the perfect indication. Moreover, Śūrpaṇakhā's gambling between the immediate choices of Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa also not approved by Vālmīki, as Śūrpaṇakhā is being brutally attacked by Lakṣmaṇa with a view to protecting Sītā. The hint for the kernel initiated with: krauncamithunād ekam avdhiḥ kāmamohitam (killing of Rāvaṇa makes Maṇḍodarī lamenting, and Sīta weeps over her seperation with Rāma too). And, there would not have been any question of śoka-karuṇa (grief) as the kernel of the Rāmāyaṇa theme, if the Rāmāyaṇa women choose from one among of their co-partners, as one could have substituted with the other.  
Regards,  
Narayanan
