Namaskar,

  
Could our ancestors included this list of five maidens to serve as a reminder that future generations take lesson and be aware of the unacceptability in the society.  

  

In reality we never see any one naming their daughters using these iconic women.

  

For that matter, we rarely see any one naming their daughter ""siita" !?

  

Just some thoughts to consider,

  

Best regards,

  

Dr Yadu
