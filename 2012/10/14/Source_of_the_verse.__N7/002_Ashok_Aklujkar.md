Please check:

Unless PB has traced the verse to an older source, the verse could also be, partly or fully, from the [Praata.h-smara.na](http://Praata.h-smara.na) collection. As I recall hearing, this (probably traditionally handed down) collection was adapted in an extended form by the Rashtriya Syaya.msevaka Sa:ngha. There could also be a[Praata.h-smara.na](http://Praata.h-smara.na) collection in one of the Puraa.nas.
