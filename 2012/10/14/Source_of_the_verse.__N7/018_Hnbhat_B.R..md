I know that she is referred to as कृष्णा rather than सुभद्रा, the own sister of कृष्णा and Draupadi worship cult is still in practice in South India and in some regions in North also.

In Pondicherry itself, I have seen Draupadi Temples, which celebrate a certain festival in honor of her.  
  

I just mentioned the common factor among the women or maidens (?) in general and by the way polyandry was already mentioned in the topic, I remembered the fact I had read it exists in the name of Draupadi, in some village/villages. I do not myself know about the particular festival celebrated in Draupadi Temples. The Pandava-s are separately installed in a side side shrine, than along with her in the temple I had visited.
