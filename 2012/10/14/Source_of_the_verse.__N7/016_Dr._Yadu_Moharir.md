My understand about Ahilyaa was continuing to have relationship with Indra (disguised as Gautama) even after knowing that he was not her husband. Society / community can forgive one's mistake when it was done unknowingly.  
  
Relevant portion from Valmaki RaamaayaNa is quoted below.  
  
Any comments, corrections and/or addition perspective would be highly appreciated.  
  
Best Rgds,
