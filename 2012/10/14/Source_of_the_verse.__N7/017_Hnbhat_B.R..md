I have one more doubt about the identity.

  

The तारा replacing सीता or कुन्ती, in the other versions. Is the maiden wife shared by वालिन् ans सुग्रिव in turn (the brothers) or the wife of बृहस्पति, the आचार्य of देव-s, shared with चन्द्र, his disciple? In either case, she can be listed with अहल्या. If सीता and/or मन्दोदरी isolated from the group as odds of the group, they have the common experience as maidens.

The tradition started started by द्रौपदी is still in practice after she had lived in a village, which is still followed in some region, according to some web source, which I do not recall right now. polyandry started by द्रौपदी.
