Dear Col;leagues,

The version I had read in a citation by Professor Nṛsimhaprasad Bhaduri of Gurudas College, Kolkata in a paper in Bengali entitled Pañcakanyā (*India and Indology – past, present and future* Kolkata 2004:118 - 139) was

अहल्या द्रौपदी कुन्ती तारा मन्दोदरी तथा। पञ्चकन्याः स्मरेन्नित्यं महापातकनाशिनम्।

The author states that though he had heard that the verse occurred in the Brahmāṇḍapurāṇa he did not find in the Brhmāṇḍapurāṇa current in Bengal.

We need not change the accepted reading *kany**āḥ *just because some married women have been mentioned in the verse. Irregularities do occur.

Best

DB
