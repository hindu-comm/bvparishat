I had already replied about the theme of this quotation being accepted or not depends on the point of view one one would like to follow. Now just for information, on how a wife is considered to be loyal one husband only, if the meaning of सतीत्व is dependent on whether she enjoyed the company of men other than her husband or not. This point had been raised and discussed in the conversation held between कुन्ती and her husband पाण्डु with examples for each before कुन्ती was convinced to make use of the *mantra*-s she had received earlier,in Mahabharata itself:

  

उद्दालककथा।। 1 ।।

उद्दालकपुत्रेण श्वेतकेतुना कृता स्त्रीपुरुषमर्यादा।। 2 ।।

गुणाधिकात् द्विजातेः पुत्रोत्पादनार्थं प्रति पाण्डोराज्ञा।। 3 ।।

कुन्त्या दुर्वाससः स्वस्य मन्त्रप्राप्तिकथनम्।। 4 ।।

  

This is the advice of the King Pandu to his wife:

  

तासां व्युच्चरमाणानां कौमारात्सुभगे पतीन्।

नाधर्मोऽभूद्वरारोहे स हि धर्मः पुराऽभवत्।।

  

1-128-5a

1-128-5b

तं चैव धर्मं पौराणं तिर्यग्योनिगताः प्रजाः।

अद्याप्यनुविधीयन्ते कामक्रोधविवर्जिताः।।

  

1-128-6a

1-128-6b

प्रमाणदृष्टो धर्मोऽयं पूज्यते च महर्षिभिः।

उत्तरेषु च रम्भोरु कुरुष्वद्यापि पूज्यते।

स्त्रीणामनुग्रहकरः स हि धर्मः सनातनः।।

  

  

As it can be seen, polyandry was in practice at his time also among tjhe Uttarakuru people. Only for others the ban is there because of the curse:

It is said that there was no such restriction, but only because of the curse of श्वेतकेतु, on seeing his mother enjoying the company of other men, though his father उद्दलक had alredady approved. The son cursed with ब्रह्महत्यापातक if any woman will be violate her loyalty to her husband.

  

तदाप्रभृति मर्यादा स्थितेयमिति नः श्रुतम्।

व्युच्चरन्त्याः पतिं नार्या अद्यप्रभृति पातकम्।।

  

1-128-44a

1-128-44b

भ्रूणहत्यासमं घोरं भविष्यत्यसुखावहम्।

*\`अद्याप्यनुविधीयन्ते कामक्रोधविवर्जिताः*।



This was the policy at the time for नियोग allowed by their husbands. I don't think this can be called polyandry that Pandu had his sons from इन्द्र, यम etc. divine personages or Draupadi, marrying the children so born by नियोग of दुर्वासस् we know as the boons or mantra's.

  

So the standard for others may not be applicable. All of the childrens are called as धर्मज, पावमानि, or वायुपुत्र, इन्द्रसूनुः or पार्थ (matronymy) and the two others यमज (the sons of the twin gods अश्विन्) which shows approval at their time.

  

This taking पुराण-s as historical events. If taken as पुराण-s as divine, itself is enough, to say "पुराणमित्येव साधु सर्वम्" which will be supplied documentation from other पुराण-s as deification or incarnation theory or super human episodes to support their claim.

  

I don't think we should take up the issue here again as a standard for applying it to the verse quoted.
