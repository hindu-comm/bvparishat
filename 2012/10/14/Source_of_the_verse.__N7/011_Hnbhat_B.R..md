Please explain your idea of सतीत्व as you know and then we can consider the सतीत्व as explained in different sources. The answer lies in your concept of सती and the view point of the celibacy or chastity which seems to be not a simple question, depending on the purpose of the question.

  

It may invite  so many serious criticisms rather than replies in a group. If you apply your standard of सतीत्व, you may not find any of the G5 group, conforming to your standard. The other view may invite elaborate discussions on the topic from different points of view from the scholars.

  

First let us read your presentation of your question in detail.
