That means everybody can be called कानीन and not कर्ण and पराशर as noted by the dictionaries and the commentators. But कन्या in the references quoted by Subrahmanyam is associated with their fathers and also probably the Anargharaghava quotation (either born in Videha country or Videha king used for Sita.)

  

And, Amara has no meaning

  

"कानीनः कन्यकाजातः सुतः"

  

"कानीनः कन्यकाजातो मातामहसुतो मतः ।। २५६.१६ ।।" अग्निपुराण.

  

I can't understand the above line of Agnipurana. It may be specifying मत is the son of mother's father.

  

And in the list none of the listed women are virgins in the strictest sense and all are married women (and not some of them as Bhattacharya remarked.)

  

Thanks for every one for clearing the idea of the verse. It should be from Brahmandapurana and we have to take the words of the article mentioned and the correction to "पञ्चकं ना" is redundant as appears in several blogs if one searches in Google. The reason for the free emendation seems to be the confusion in the use of the word कन्या than anything else.
