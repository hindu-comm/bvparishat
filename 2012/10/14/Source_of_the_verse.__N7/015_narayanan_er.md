Dear Dr. Moharir,  
The Rāmāyaṇa characters of Ahalyā, Sītā, Tārā, Mandodarī or Maṇḍodarī, and Draupadī and Kuntī appear in the Mahābhārata, have some unique features of grief. The first three-Ahalyā, Sītā and Tārā are the victims of suspect on their chastity from Gautama, Rāma and Bālin. The humiliation they suffer even from their own husbands in name of such sort of suspect and to overcome such mental shocks, they gained maturity in handling women crisis in that contemporary society. There is hardly any hint of polyandry in the Rāmāyaṇa, whereas the Mahābhārata brings Draupadī and Kuntī as the icons of such a social practice. But the grief from the humiliation factor, these two Mahābhārata characters match up with other three of the Rāmāyaṇa. Karṇa publicly thrusts the prostitution upon Draupadī on account of her polyandry. Karṇa himself is being rediculed over his real (Kuntī) mother's non-acceptance as own son. Naturally, all the Kurus including Duśśāsana will enjoy the disastrous condition of any lady from their rival Pāñcāla group, but exposing one in public is something horrible and unaffordable beyond the thrust over an "approved" polyandry. Kuntī had a marital husband of having Pāṇḍu and Arjuna for Draupadī. The polygomy we see through Daśaratha etc. in the Rāmāyaṇa and Bālin wanted Rumā, Sugrīva's wife too along with Tārā is a polygomic attempt. Rāvaṇa too wanted Sītā along with Mandodarī or Maṇḍodarī in the same way, which was unaffordable for the latter with a view to having the monogomy. Ahalyā had been cheated by the disguise of Indra who appeared to be a Gautama to her. The Mahābhārata finds a different solution in the form of Cyavana along with the two Aśvins appeared alike to Sukanyā but choosed her right sage. So, what the Purāṇa contemplates here is that the mental torture suffered by these icons of chastity is to approved, and such icons should be worshipped through remembering them.  
Regards,  
Narayanan
