Namaskar Dr Bhat,

  

Hear are my thoughts on - Tara

  

Tara was bR^ihaspatii's wife who bore a son (budha) from Chandra (The Moon) (padma puraaNa).  

  

If one takes the story literally then, again "Tara" having had children from other than her husband was not acceptable.

  

For this reason Tara may have been included in the group of Five Maidens that can potentially serve as a reminder for future generations in a illustrative pictorial manner.

  

For this reasons I compare the Maidens to the LIGHT HOUSE that provide warning to future travelers.

  

Just some thoughts to consider.

  

Best Rgds,

  

Dr Yadu
