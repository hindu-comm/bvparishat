Namaste.  

### मकरालयकन्यकायाः (कनकधारास्तोत्रम्) 

तव स्तन्यं मन्ये **धरणिधरकन्ये** हृदयतः.

पयःपारावारः परिवहति सारस्वत इव ।

दयावत्या दत्तं द्रविडशिशुरास्वाद्य तव यत्.  
कवीनां प्रौढानां अजनि कमनियः कवयिता । । ७५ । । सौन्दर्यलहरी  

O Daughter of Himavan! I guess that the milk from your breasts is a sea of nectar which flows from your heart as the flood of sweet, poetic words of Saraswati which, moved by compassion, you fed the *dravida* child who became the foremost among poets authoring great works of devotional poetry.

  
Here are two instances where the word 'kanyA' is used with reference to Goddess Lakshmi and UmA pArvati. In one place there is the 'ka' pratyaya. We can also appreciate that in both the cases the objects of praise are 'wedded' Mothers, to Hari and Hara respectively. Yet the use of the term 'kanyA' referring to their origin of birth, the samudra and the HimavAn, is used as an epithet. I think that in such cases it is meant to mean 'daughter' simply rather than strictly someone who is yet to be married, a child and one who has not attained puberty.  The Apte Sanskrit-English dictionary gives several meanings for the word 'कन्या’ and the *fourth meaning* is: **a woman in general.**  
  
So going by this we may say that the five are simply meant to be just women.
