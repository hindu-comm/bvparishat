Dear scholars

There was an enquiry about the books on aesthetics. A lot of work has been done in this area of aesthetics in hindi language. The scholar can consult Dr Nagendra's bharatiya kavya shastra ki parampara etc. Hindi scholars have clarified the concept of saundarya in details in several books which one can find in the library.
