It seems to be derived from UNADI, इण् suffix or इम्,

  

"अज्यतिभ्यां च" (४-११०) इण् suffix. Rather with "स्त्रियां क्तिन्" it simply give rise to अत्+ति - अत्ति - स्व+अत्ति - स्वात्ति, and then one would have to resort to पृषोदरादि to get the one त् lost.

  

With स्वाति, one would variable with long ई, with "इतश्चानिञ:" कृदिकारादक्क्तिनः underबह्वादिभ्यश्च  4-1-45 it can take ङीष् optionally in feminine gender.

  

It can be शोभनम् अतति - also, स्वातिः with the इण् suffix. सु+आतिः

  

-"संज्ञासु धातुरूपाणि प्रत्ययाश्चत तत: परे। कार्याद्विद्यादनूबन्धमेतच्छज्ञस्त्रमुणादिषु"। is the common convention followed according to the meaning, they are derived with proper suffix and root appropriate to get the form, which are considered as अव्युत्पन्न.  

  

This is how I can understand. And, it is a common consensus among grammarians that

  

"व्युत्पत्तिनिमित्तमन्यत्, प्रवृत्तिनिमित्तमन्यत् " So there is no need to have the relation with its derived meaning with its function under different circumstances.

  

Narayanan might have different derivation process with क्तिन् and even derived with क्तिन्, it is difficult to get the desired form. The suffix इम् also may give the same form. स्व+अति - स्वाति the functionality of the word is a different matter, if it is the intention of your question.

be considered. It is from अत सातत्यगते। स्वेनैव अततीति। क्तिन्। स्वातिः। अत सातत्यगते। स्वेनैव अततीति। ङीष्। स्वाती।"  

  

It is given in Shabdakalpadruma. The same has another shade of meaning too:
