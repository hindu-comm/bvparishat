Dear Dr.Narayanan,& Dr.Ramanujan

The etymology of स्वाती (describedby N)is revealing. First it was निष्ट्या 'kept out'. Later it becomes स्वातीas it'travels on its own'! This I feel is good evidenceto correlate some aspects of Vedic thought process withthe then observable sky.I find NighanTu alsolists अतति under गतिकर्माणः\|\|



The नक्षत्रीय प्रजापति description also fits neatlyhere. ThePrajaapati wasfigured to spread five stars, roughly60 degrees, about one-third of the visible night sky. This was an effort to figure out a pattern (constellation) similar to Shishumaara and Rksha which we have discussed previously.



Further Bhatta-Bhaskara's comment (posted by R)

प्रिया भवत्येव, निष्ट्याया हृदयत्वात् ।अपि च निष्ट्यायास्तस्याङ्गविशेषत्वात्

  
न पुनरियं पितृगृहमागच्छति यद्वा - न पुनरागच्छतीव ।पत्युरतिवल्लभत्वात्



may possiblyhint a link with Aryamaa of RV 5.3.2



तवमर्यमाभवसि..........दम्पतीसमनसाकृणोषि \|\|



which hymn is prescribedin marriages.



The above points taken together, I feel, supports the sky-earth reciprocative relation or evenmapping. Please comment.



best regards



RN Iyengar
