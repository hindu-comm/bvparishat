Dear Scholars,



The old name for स्वाती nakshatra was निष्ट्या. This usage appears in the Tai. Br(1.5.1-3) I have two queries on this name.

1\. Doesthis word give the sense of 'kept out' or 'far away'?

2\. Recently on Shankara-TV channel I heard duringa discussion on Dharmashastra, that there is a vedic statement/injunction that if one likes to see that his dear daughter does notreturn from the in-laws' house hermarriage should be performed under Svaati star. Can some one quote the original textalong withthe source?



Any other relevant information from ancient sources about the name निष्ट्याis welcome.Thereappears to besome astronomical significance in this name;hence this question. Please help.



Regards



RN Iyengar
