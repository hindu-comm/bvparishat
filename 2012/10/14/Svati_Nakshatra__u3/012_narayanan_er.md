Respected Professor Iyengar,

It is not clear that how far Hewitt has cross-checked the etymologies of Svaatii and Aryaman for their identification. Apart from निष्ट्या, the etymology of the term स्वातिः / स्वाती is also to be considered. It is from अत सातत्यगते। स्वेनैव अततीति। क्तिन्। स्वातिः। अत सातत्यगते। स्वेनैव अततीति। ङीष्। स्वाती। There are two meanings: सूर्यपत्नीविशेषः and खङ्गः (sword, almost like the appearance of the whole constellation where Arcturus (α Boötis) is one among those. But Hewitt might have tried to compare the other designations: Alramech, Abramech, α Boötis etc. Antares and the Greek terminology: Αρκτοῦρος with (अर्यमन्) अर्यमा। सूर्यः। It is from ऋ गत्याम्। यत्। अर्यः। अर्यं श्रेष्ठम्। माङ्। मिमीते। कनिन्। to make the term (अर्यमन्) अर्यमा। सूर्यः। But the meaning of Αρκτοῦρος (guardian of the bear) is quite far away from this. The relationship of Svaatii and Aryaman, according to the Indian way is the husband-wife relationship.  
Regarding “the postulation of Vaayu as the devataa for Svaatii” but scientists say: “It (Arcturus) has likely exhausted its hydrogen and has begun fusing helium into oxygen and carbon in its core. It will continue to expand before sloughing off its outer shell and ending its life.” Is it the speed, you say: 122 Km/s relative to the solar system, equal to that of Hanumat's speed causing brightness and disintegration to it? Is it due to the extension of acceleration causing its declination in degrees towards south after many a number eras? And, Sir, I would like to know the occultism to RohiNii and Maghaa in detail, any link will do.

Regards,

Narayanan
