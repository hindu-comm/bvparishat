नमो नारायणाय  

You wrote "the etymology of the term स्वातिः / स्वाती is also to be considered. It is from अत सातत्यगते। स्वेनैव अततीति। क्तिन्। स्वातिः। अत सातत्यगते। स्वेनैव अततीति। ङीष्। स्वाती।"

My query is limited to know whether the above is specifically described to be so in any grammar text or is it the application of a general rule to this particular word.

  

Excuse me for my repeated query.

  

Thanks
