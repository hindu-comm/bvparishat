Respected Professor Iyengar,

Professor H.N. Bhat had explained everything in his previous mail on this thread. I have nothing more to add. The suffix क्तिन् could be my mistake, whereas इम्, इण्, and इन् also (according to Vacaspatyam) is to be considered for the short इ ending form "स्वातिः". I was confused with the forms like गतिः (गम् क्तिन्) and मतिः (मन् क्तिन्), and added क्तिन्। Sorry for making confusion and I have no more knowledge about the terminology to add when the eminent scholars like Professor Bhat are explaining, and my role is to learn more from the elders like him and many others. It only shows the lack of my experience. As Professor Bhat said: प्रवृत्तिनिमित्तं and व्युत्पत्तिनिमित्तं are different. Otherwise, if not, for instance, when we etymologize: गच्छति इति गौः, (गच्छति अगच्छति च गवि गोशब्दव्यपदेशो भवति), one which goes is a bull (etymologically), one which does not go is also a bull (by action). So etymology has nothing to with the cause of action. So, स्व \> अत् \> इ \> : = स्वातिः has nothing to do with the constellation α Boötis.

Then regarding your specific query, lexicons with commentaries, encyclopaedia are consulted regarding searching terminology. So, I just took the help of the Sabdakalpadruma of Sir Radhakant Deb and the Vacaspatyam of Taranath Tarkavacaspati, which give the etymological elements, derivation etc. following Panini or other grammars, derivations in commentaries of various lexicons consulted by those composers. Of course अत सातत्यगते is from the Panini's Dhatupatha and suggesting feminine suffixes like इम्, इण्, and इन् also from Unadi, and ङीष् suffix from Panini. The etymologies and derivation process are work in that way. Although they are specifically described in their grammatical pattern, precisely how the heard sound is justified, but have nothing to do with their activities. If we use लावण्यम्, no salt could be used out of it for a dish. But at the same time, when we use दाशरथिः, that man has a relation as an offspring of दशरथः (but दश=10, and रथः=chariot are related with that King in different way). Thanks for mails, Sir, through which I could correct my mistakes.  

Regards,

Narayanan
