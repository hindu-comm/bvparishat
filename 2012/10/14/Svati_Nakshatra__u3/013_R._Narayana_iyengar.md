Dear Dr.Narayanan,

As always your discussions are scholarly and valuable. I do notautomatically believe as correct whatwestern indologistssay about theVedic sky! I only pointed out a claim which may as well bebaseless.



I agree that the derivation of 'Svaati' should also be looked into. Thanks for posting the details. AFAIK in Vedic texts Svati is a single star. There is no reference to a group. AVP Nakshatrakalpa (1.1.2)is clear that'ekaa svatih.' Also in 1.39.3 Svati is described as 'dhvajo antariks.asya'. How did it acquire the meaning of 'Sword'? We have to see the first textwhere such a meaning is given to the word Svaati.



A simple word search with RV shows निष्ट्याandderivative appears in 6.75.19, and 10.133.5 besides 8.1.13 which you have pointed out. whether these are references toour starneedsfurther study.  


I am not an astrophysicist, hence I am not able to answer your question about the exact reasons for the movement of Svati. As I understand expansion is not the reason.
