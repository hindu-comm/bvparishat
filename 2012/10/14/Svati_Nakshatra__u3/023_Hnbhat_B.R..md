There is another saying also. According to the meaning in use, the primary, secondary derivations and compounds should be analyzed, so as to give the form compatible with for form and its usage.

  

"अभिधानलक्षणा हि कृत्तद्धितसमासाः।"

  

If there is no such अभिधान or denotation, one cannot force etymology to get another meaning. Like, Pankaja, is used in the sense of lotus. It is never used to mean anything in the mud (panka) like conchshells, or any aquatic creature or plants in the water, as extended. though they live in they all crop in the mud. There are other standards of meaning classified by etymology, where yoga, rudhi, yogarudhi, rudhayaugika find place to denote the things by them apart from polysemy natural to many words. This is seen in the case of the word स्वाति itself.

  

Vedic words are analyzed following the Yaska's derivational process, than Panini's, in Vedic contexts. If they are found in astronomical texts, they are to be analyzed according to the norms of the relevant astronomy or astrology or kalpa or dharmashastra.

  

  

Mixing up may not give intended results.

  

This is my sincere opinion, as I do not know Vedic terminology or Vedic Astronomy/Astrology etc. Explaining out of context, isolated words is not the way Yaska prescribed. That is his work is considered as supplement to Panini's work, both considered as Vedanga-s. Jyotisha has its own terminology and norms and it has to be examined in their light, which forms another Vedaanga, along with Kalpa. Both forming a set inter related, I suppose. So also the set of मीमांसा - पूर्व and उत्तर, corresponding to संहिता-ब्राह्मण portions and आरण्यक-portions of Vedic Literature, respectively.

  

Of course, free interpretation is always possible, leaving alonge Badarayana and Jaimini, with their sUtra-s. of the two parts of the Vedic Literature, with or without the help of the duo Vyakarana-Nirukta which traditional commentators relied upon for their explanations.
