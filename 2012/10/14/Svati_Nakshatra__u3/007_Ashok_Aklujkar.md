1\. Does this word give the sense of 'kept out' or 'far away'?\<  
  

It very well can. Historically, it is derived from nis/ni.h + tya staying outside, 'placed out'. Compare the formations: adhitya (as in adhityakaa), apatya 'offspring', upatya (as in upatyakaa), nitya 'one which stays down --> one which is not destroyed even when the outside appearance may change', pratya.  
  
The retroflexion in ni.s.tya/ni.s.tyaa is due to the preceding i, which first affects dental s and makes it retroflex .s, which in turn changes the following t to .t.  
  
a.a.
