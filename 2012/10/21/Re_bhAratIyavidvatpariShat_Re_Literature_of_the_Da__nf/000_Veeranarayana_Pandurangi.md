I request all of the members to stop this topic. there are always problems with English. As HN Bhat pointed out

"why should we start the discussion here afresh.dharma, karma, yoga, yogin are accepted as such in Dictionaries also

as they could not be translated even roughly with any English words" so even mata etc. can also used in english rather than cult
