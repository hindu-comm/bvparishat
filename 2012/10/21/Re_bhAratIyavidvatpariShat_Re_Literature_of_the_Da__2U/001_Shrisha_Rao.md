If we need to be complete in that way, there are actually two more in the OED also, hardly positive:  
  
• a misplaced or excessive admiration for a particular person or thing: a cult of personality surrounding the leaders.  
• \[ usu. as modifier \] a person or thing that is popular or fashionable, esp. among a particular section of society: a cult film.  
  
And while on the subject, the first meaning of "cult" of the OED is \*criticized\* by Fowler as "unfortunate" and an "anti-Saxonism" (of which other instances he gives are "major" for "better," "premier" for "first," etc. It is thus not the correct usage.

That is certainly an arbitrary standard rather than a proper authority, but anyway, let's read the rest of the paragraph:  
  
"Christianity was once considered a Jewish cult. But popular usage conjures up scenes of brainwashing, manipulation of the minds and lives of cult members, and a leader who is usually involved with some kind of sex scandal."
