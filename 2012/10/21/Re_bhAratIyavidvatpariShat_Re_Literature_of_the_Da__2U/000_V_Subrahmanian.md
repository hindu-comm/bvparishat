This is exactly what I have (already) done:  
  
Oxford English Dictionary (OED):  
  

1.a system of **religious veneration and devotion** directed toward a particular figure or object: *the cult of St. Olaf* \[note that there is no OR here but only AND\]  
  

2.a relatively small group of people having religious beliefs or practices regarded by others as strange or sinister.  
  
**Only** the second **and not** the first was cited in an earlier post of yours.

Even the 'arbitrary' Merriam Dictionary (of the school standard) also **supports** the OED:  
  
 //**Collective veneration or worship** (e.g., the cult of the saints—meaning collective veneration of the saints—in Roman Catholicism).//  
  
//"Cult" is a very subjective term. The dictionary says it is "a system of religious worship; devotion, homage to a person or thing." The classical definition is not negative at all. It merely describes a religious expression unique to a particular locale.//
