I am aware of these and many more too. But I stuck to the one that is relevant to the topic: Duttatreya worship, etc.

Alas! One 'authority' criticizes another 'authority'! To which 'authority' shall we appeal to?  
  
Ultimately 'we' become the authority that decides to take 'that' meaning which suits 'our' thinking/preferences.  
  
That shows the 'mata bheda' between/across lexicons. I am reminded of an old verse:  
  
कपिलो यदि सर्वज्ञः कणादो नेति का मतिः (कथा) ।  
तावुभौ यदि सर्वज्ञौ मतभेदः कथं तयोः ॥

I had seen this and deliberately not cited it as it is only a 'conjuring up' and therefore the 'popular usage' is a wrong usage:  
  

Definition of **conjure (Oxford dictionary) <http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/american_english/conjure>  
**

### verb

-   
    

    1 /ˈkänjər, ˈkən-/ *\[with object\]* make (something) appear
    unexpectedly or seemingly from nowhere as if by magic: *Anne
    **conjured up** a most delicious homemade stew*

    
-   
    

    call (an image) to mind: *she had forgotten how to **conjure up**
    the image of her mother’s face*

    
-   
    

    (of a word, sound, smell, etc.) cause someone to feel or think of
    (something): *one scent can **conjure up** a childhood summer beside
    a lake*

    
-   
    

    call upon (a spirit or ghost) to appear, by means of a magic ritual:
    *they hoped to **conjure up** the spirit of their dead friend*

    

(the old Oxford dictionary with me gives) for 'conjure up' 'cause to appear to the fancy'.  

In Sanskrit it would amount to स्वकपोलकल्पितम् or माया, कुहक, etc. and therefore not worth considering.
