*"Vedanam sama*-*vedo'smi* ” So goes the saying which gives an important place in our vaideeka dharma.

But Sama Vedas are continuing to be a vedic minority.

  

Sri Kanchi Kamakoti Peetadhipathi Jagadguru Sri Sankaracharya Swamigal has ordained that a

SAMA VEDA SABHA be held in which Sama veda pundits, those who have studied Sama vedam and those

who are Sama vedis as well as Sama veda patashala vidyarthis will participate. The broad objectives of the

sabha would be :

1\. It would be an opportunity for Svashakha Sama vedis to know one another

2\. To enable Sama vedis preserve their identity

3\. To acquire more knowledge about Sama vedam

  

Accordingly arrangements are being made to conduct this sabha on Sunday (Brindavana dwadasi – tulasi

vivaham) the 10th day of karthikai of nandana year i.e. on 25-11-2012 at SANKARALAYAM, Mayor

Ramanathan road, Chetpet, Chennai.

  

During this event, Sama veda vidyarthis will perform Samaveda parayanam. Senior Sama veda

pundits will deliver lectures on Sama veda. There will be a purposeful discussion regarding support and

encouragement of higher studies for those who have completed their adhyayanam, as also on other topics

such as Sama veda and yagnas (srowtham), on those Sama vedis who are agnihotris (Somayagis) and on

various notes in tamil literature about Sama vedam.

  

Elderly Sama veda pundits will be suitably honoured and other Sama vedis and vidyarthis will also be

suitably rewarded. It is also proposed to bring out a Sama veda directory after this sabha.

We therefore request all Sama vedis – particularly the senior pundits, vaideekas, vidyarthis and

gruhasthas to benefit by participating in this sabha.
