Dear friends

is it true? follow this-

"Lalita sahsra namam \[L.S\] not written by Vyasa-maharshi". Because

1-L.S not found in any of the Brahmanda Purana manuscripts either southern or northern recensions.

2-One of the nama is “Ratnagraiveya “***Chinthaka***” lola muktaphalanvitha-

Here *chinthaka* is a telugu word for golden neck ornament, which had come forth in 12^(th) century.

3-Commentator Bhaskararaya also mentioned as this is a telugu word and commented as sanskritised meaning - chinta+ ka pratyaya

kindly reveal me
