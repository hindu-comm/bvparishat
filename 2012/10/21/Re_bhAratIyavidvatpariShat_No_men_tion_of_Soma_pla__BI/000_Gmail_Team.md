Dear Dr. D. Bhattacharya, Thanks for Atharvaveda reference on Soma plant. I will write to my friend in India and tell him that his information was wrong. N.R.Joshi

The following may be consulted for checking how many times the Soma plant/drink has been mentioned in the Saunakiiya version of the Atharvaveda

Atharvaveda (Saunakiiya),Part IV Fasciculus II (Mantra, Pada etc)VVRI., Hoshiarpur, 1964 pp. 385-386.

The Paippalaada version too often refers to the plant/drink.

Best
