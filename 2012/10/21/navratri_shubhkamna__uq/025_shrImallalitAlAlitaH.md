Why not ? I'm ready for that.

I didn't say anything like that.  
  

> The Sanskrit is a computerized symbolic language.

  
That's a new thing. It's a computerized language ?? Computerized means what ? Created with computers !!! ???  
Symbolic language ?? What is this ?? Symbols are not language. They are diferent things.  
  

> The scholars are confined to traditions only,

  
That's fine. What do you expect from them ?? Shun the tradition and run with your biased imaginations - as you previous post requested !!??

'It' means what ?? Sanskrit language ?? Language is innate, it can't explore anything.  
If you mean to say that scholars shunning tradition can explore new things with Sanskrit, then guide them or seek their help instead of asking them to not use Sanskrit.  
I don't know how could scholars or any person not using or practicing Sanskrit attract a layman towards Sanskrit. A man who has is himself not faithful to practice of Sanskrit can't impress others. OR, the impression will be temporary.  
  

> it is the first language, which was developed scientifically.

  
I don't think Computer-Scientists developed Sanskrit. If you go on insisting this or any such thing, you will be just revealing your bias towards and faith in Sanskrit and nothing more.  


> The Vedas are beyond interpretation? why?  

  
I didn't say anything like this anywhere.
