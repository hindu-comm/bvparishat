Dear Sir,  
  
Better try to understand that you need to think more. It is also applicable for you also.  
  
A know about the Sanskrit as script only and Hindi as foreign language. It is ignorance. The Sanskrit is a computerized symbolic language. The scholars are confined to traditions only, it can explore much more, if the persons from other fields are attracted towards Sanskrit.  
  
How it will be destructive? Sanskrit was the language of Indus Valley, and it is the first language, which was developed scientifically. They framed Sanskrit in such a manner that all other languages can be extinct, but Sanskrit will remain as such. You are scholar of Sanskrit and Vedas also, The Vedas are beyond interpretation? why?  
  
With regards  
  
Dr.C.P.Trivedi
