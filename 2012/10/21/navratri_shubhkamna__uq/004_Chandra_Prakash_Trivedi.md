भो विद्वज्जनाः।  
  
  

I request {भारतीयविद्वत्परिषत्} that along with Sanskrit use Hindi also, so the Sanskrit will spread more easily, as both have devanagiri lipi, as such both are sister and all other languages are their daughters. The Sanskrit is mother language, Adi Shankaracharya has united India with its cultural heritage on the basis of Sanskrit. If the Sanskrit will be restricted to Pundit only, then the Sanskrit will remain untouchable, and treasure of knowledge will remain unexplored. The use of English is also necessary to establish it at International level.  
  
  
With regards, future of India is within you, think and meditate over it.
