Although you appear to wish good of Sanskrit, your suggestions are destructive in nature.  
See below...

How in this world use of another language is going to spread Sanskrit ?  
Do you mean to spread name of Sanskrit language in this world by the means of other languages ? That's not enough.  
If you meant 'increase in use of Sanskrit' by the word 'spread', then how this use of another language is going to 'spread' Sanskrit ?  
If you mean that learning will be easy by the means of other language, then mind that 'learning about Sanskrit' is not going to 'spread it'. You must use it.  
  

> as both have devanagiri lipi,

  
What a logic !!  
Having just same script is not going to spread the language.  
Using hindi, which has same script as Sanskrit, is useful for only hindi knowing people and that too for what purpose ? Not for making specialist of Sanskrit language. It will just help to learn about Sanskrit.  
  

> as such both are sister and all other languages are their daughters.

  
Wow !! Great logic. Discovering mother-daughter relationsip !!  
Any language which has devanAgarI script is mother and others are daughters, even when there is no proof which could establish it undoubtedly - shows just bias.  
  

> The Sanskrit is mother language, Adi Shankaracharya has united India > with its cultural heritage on the basis of Sanskrit.

  
So, when bhagavatpAda-sha\~Nkara united all by Sanskrit, why are there cries for hindi and english here ?  
Come and get united by using Sanskrit.  
  

> If the Sanskrit will be restricted to Pundit only,

  
Who is restricting it. Scholars are talking in Sanskrit in front of you. Are they hiding Sanskrit from you or pulic ?  
You are the person who started to ask for less use of Sanskrit(by asking for use of other language).  
And that too why ? Just because you can't understand their talk properly.  
It will be better if you yourself start to learn Sanskrit to understand them, instead of asking them to not use pure Sanskrit. You are asking them to not use their skills. You are trying to divert there flow of energy from Sanskrit. Your request just shows that pure Sanskrit is not welcome here and those who use it are useless. It demotivates. In other words you are demotivating them and destroying Sanskrit.  
And still you pose that you are for spreading it !!??  
  

> then the Sanskrit will remain untouchable,

  
For whom ? Ignorant or learned ?  
Definitely for first ones.  
If Sanskrit or any other language is hated by ignorants, let it be so. Who cares.  
  

> and treasure of knowledge will remain unexplored.

  
Same apples here.  
  

> The use of English is also necessary to establish it at International > level.  

  
All said applies to English too.  
  

> With regards, future of India is within you, think and meditate over > it.  

  
Better try to understand that you need to think more.
