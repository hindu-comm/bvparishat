Dear Sir,  
  
With due respect to your skill and wisdom, you are doing great job, you are right that Hindi is not needed after every Sanskrit sentence, When needed you are using Hindi, it is sufficient to preserve Sanskrit - Hindi connection.  
  
You are not avoiding Hindi. Your skill of Sanskrit will reach to many.  
  
  
**To follow the tradition is great but to understand the meaning behind it, is not wrong. The Sanskrit is symbolic language with metaphors and riddles, where the words have vast ocean of knowledge in the background.** Hence I said that it is computer language, developed by our great seers, and scientists.  

The Vedic language is not a common language, it has some hidden meanings, and Vedic seers have drawn the attention of the scholars towards this fact in their own way. The metaphors and the riddles are the thought provoking instruments only. It has been expressed that how the Gods repose the praise songs? He who knows not this, what will he do with praise-songs? A sage who knows this rightly is his father’s father. It means the compilation of the Vedic hymns in the metaphors has an aim and purpose; one should search the hidden truth behind it. If one is able to grasp the real meaning, he will touch the height of the forefathers in knowledge.



Upon what syllable of holy praise-song as 'there their highest heaven the Gods repose them ² who knows not this, what will he do with praise-song? But they who know it well sit here assembles Rig-Veda 1-164-39

They told me these were males though truly females: he who hath eyes sees this, the blind discerns not.

The son who is a sage hath comprehended: who knows this rightly is his father’s father Rig-Veda 1-164-16

**In the same fashion at another place, the mechanical chanting of the praise songs has been compared with the awakening of the frogs at the beginning of the rainy season. The seer compares the din of their croaking with the chants of priests, and the clamour of pupils at school repeating the words of their teacher. It has been considered as a satire on the Brahmans, who do not know the purpose and meaning of the Vedic hymns. The pupil learn the lesson from their teacher and mechanically reproduce it, just like the year brings the rain in due course of time and fertilize the soil, in the same fashion the Adhvaryu - sage will come forward to explore the hidden truth Rig-Veda 7-103 **
