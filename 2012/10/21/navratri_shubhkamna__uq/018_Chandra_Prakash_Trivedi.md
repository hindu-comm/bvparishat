The matter has been discussed but I do not remember where.  
  

as the preferred script.?  
  
Dear Dr. Bhattacharya,  
  
You are right. I may not be a modern Sanskrit scholar like you. I have raised the issue at Udipi.  
If we can adopt a easy script, how we are going to harm Sanskrit. Hindi is a international language, and Sanskrit was international language once in the history, just like modern English.  
  
The Sanskrit is a computerized symbolic language, hence the hidden knowledge is unexplored.  
  
The Sanskrit was language of Indus Valley, but you will not find the trace of Sanskrit script any where in the excavated material?  
  
With regards  
  
Dr.C.P.Trivedi  

  
  
  
the Assamese-Bengali- Maithili script, Nagari, Gujarati, Grantha, Javanese, Kannaḍ, Malayalam, Nandi Nagari (related to Nagari), Newari (related to the ABM mentioned above), Oriya, Śāradā,Telugu (closely related to Kannaḍ)and several local variations not mentioned here (eg., Karaṇa in Orissa), were used for Sanskrit according to region. The ABM-Newari combine and Nagari were most wide-spread but the complex character of the former proved obstacles to its adoption
