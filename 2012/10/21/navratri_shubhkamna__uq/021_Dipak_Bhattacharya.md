I do not understand what is meant by

\<you will not find the trace of **Sanskrit script** any where in the excavated material>

What ismeant is by Sanskrit script? There is no special script for Sanskrit. Is it meantthat one will not find the trace of the **Sanskrit language** among the excavated material? Or, is the intended meaning"one will not find the trace of the **Nagari script**among the excavated material"?

It seems that there is a great difference between what is posted and what was meant to be said.
