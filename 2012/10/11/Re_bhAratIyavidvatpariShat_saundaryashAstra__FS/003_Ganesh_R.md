There are many modern writers in this field too. The works of Dr. R.P.  
DvivEdi (kaavyaalaMkaarakaarikaa, naaTakakaarikaa,  
saahityashaareerakaM), Dr.RajendraMishra (abhiraajayashObhUShaNaM),  
Dr. Radhaavallabha TripaaThi (abhinavakaavyaalaMkaarasUtraaNi) are a  
few significant works in these years.Even the writings of Dr. P.  
Ramachandrudu and Dr. C. Rajendran are note worthy as they try to  
propound new theories.  
  
However, I honestly feel that the writings of masters like M.  
Hiriyanna (Art Experience), Kuppusswamy Sastry (high ways and byways  
in Indian Aesthetics), V.Raghavan (Some concepts in  
Aalamkaarashaastra, The number of Rasa-s, The concept of Beautiful in  
Sanskrit, Bhoja's Srngaaraprakaasha, Sanskrit Drama: Theory and  
Practice), K. Krishnamoorty ( Indian Literary theories: A  
reappraisal, Studies in Indian Aesthetics, Essays in Sanskrit  
Criticism, New bearing on Indian literary theory and criticism) are a  
few more insightful books which can be added to the list of that  
furnished by other scholars. In the field of music, dance and  
painting/sculpture, writings of Premalataa Sharma, Dr. R.  
Satyanaaraayana, Dr. G.C. Pande, Dr. kapila Vaatsyayana, Dr. padma  
Subrahmanyam, Dr. Anupa Pande are a few valuable additons.
