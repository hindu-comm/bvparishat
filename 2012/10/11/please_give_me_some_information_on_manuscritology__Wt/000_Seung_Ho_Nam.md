Dear Sir/ Madam,



I'm Seung-Ho Nam and sanskrit student in Jadavpur University.

I was trying to contact since last August but failed.



I'm really eagrer to participate for the manuscriptology on November.

But I don't know how to access your related website and how to download your application form.



Please give me the web-address for the anouncement and down-loading the application form.



Yours sincerely

With best regards



Seung Ho Nam
