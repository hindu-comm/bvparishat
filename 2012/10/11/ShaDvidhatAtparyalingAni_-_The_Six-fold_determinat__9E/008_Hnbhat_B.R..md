I think you are right. Subrahmanyan's English translation need not be perfect in all respect.

  

अपूर्वता of a विधि is an important factor मीमांसा, in deciding the purport of the context. The विधि should not be prescribed in some other context and then only it serves as the main purport of the given contextunprecedented अपूर्वand otherwise it serves as subsidiary अङ्ग for the earlier context. Only this much is meant by uniqueness used by Subrahmanyam intended for without being secondary to any other context.
