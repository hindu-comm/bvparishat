Thanks for your comment on the word 'ekaika'. You are technically  
correct. But as you have pointed out, slowly 'yogaat ruudhir-  
baliiyasii' seems to be working. It is not only with Tamil but in  
Kannada use also it is used in the sense of onde-ondu (only one).  
However, had I recollected the use of the word in the subhaashita  
yauvanam dhanasampattih prabhutvam avivekitaa\|  
ekaikam apyanarthaaya kimu yatra catus.t.ayam\|\|  
I would have deleted the word 'ekaika' in my original suggestion. I  
appreciate your rigour in pointing out a subtle fault!  
  
sincerely,  
  
RN Iyengar
