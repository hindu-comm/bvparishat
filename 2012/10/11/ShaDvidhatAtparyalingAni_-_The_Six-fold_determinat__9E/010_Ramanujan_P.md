Dear Sri Iyengar,



kshamyatAm, nAham "nitpicky" bhavitum utsahe!



It is perhaps my personal take on the state of confusion in contemporary  
Indian musciological writing that lead to my comment about the word  
ekaika. But musicology is a topic for another discussion.



Best regards,

Vidyasankar



ps. What would be a good, pithy Sanskrit word for nitpicky?
