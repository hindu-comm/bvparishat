\> Whether it occurred in Brahmaloka or anywhere else, how can it be a Pramana, when its very existence is "unheard of and unknown"'.  

\> You should follow the crux of the argument.  
  

No, \*you\* should put up or shut up. Come up with some actual evidence for your claims, and don't dodge the issue when your bluff is called (which it has been repeatedly).  
  
\> When Madhva himself did not care to prove its existence, and not even the Dvaita scholar in the said assembly, it is the least botheration of anybody !!!  
  
Except you, unfortunately.
