Sir,  
Here is one reference to the word 'vaikunTha' in the 'nArAyaNopaniShad'. (नाराणाथर्वशिरोपनिषत्)  
  
प्रत्यगानन्दं ब्रह्म पुरुषं प्रणवस्वरूपम्। अकार उकार मकार इति। तानेकधा समभवत्तदेतदोमिति। यमुक्त्वा मुच्यते योगी जन्मसंसार-बन्धनात् । ऊँ नमो नारायणायेति मन्त्रोपासकः। *वैकुण्ठभुवनलोकं* गमिष्यति ।   
  
Someone may see if there is sAyaNabhAShyam for this. The above stands printed in the 'mantrapuShpam' book (pocket size), page 10, in devanagari printed by the Ramkrishna Mutt, Chennai.
