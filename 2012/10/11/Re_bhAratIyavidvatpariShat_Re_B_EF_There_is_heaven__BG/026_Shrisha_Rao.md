It is hardly "unknown and unheard of" when it is spoken of by a प्रमाण, to wit, the ऋगाद्या भारतं चैव text; on the question of its existence, no one but you has claimed, with no evidence I'm afraid, that it only exists in Brahmaloka. So one can turn the question around: if the मूलरामायण were never available in this world at all (even in the past when the access to texts was much richer), how do you explain the fact that there are mentions of it? Since you are the one claiming that the मूलरामायण has never existed in this world, the onus is on you to answer.
