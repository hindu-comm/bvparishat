In the Indian tradition there is a distinction between 'Astika' and 'nAstika'.  
  
'Astikyam' is :  
  

1.  Belief in lokAntara - the existence of other loka-s than the one
    where we live now. 2.  Belief in dharma - adharma and puNya - pApa 3.  The above two are 'ateendriya viShaya' that is 'super sensory' or
    beyond the grasp of our senses and inference. 4.  Belief in the prAmAnya of the Veda 5.  The Veda is the pramANa for the items mentioned in 1 and 2 above  

  
Those who do not subscribe to the above are termed 'nAstika-s'. Science does not subscribe to the above. There is a mantra in the Kathopanishad:  
  

    न साम्परायः प्रतिभाति बालं
        प्रमाद्यन्तं वित्तमोहेन मूढम् .
    अयं लोको नास्ति पर इति मानी
        पुनः पुनर्वशमापद्यते मे .. ६..

न never साम्परायः the other world प्रतिभाति is revealed बालं the ignorant प्रमाद्यन्तं who blunders वित्तमोहेन lured by wealth मूढम् befooled. अयं this लोको world alone नास्ति not पर the other world इति thus मानी thinking पुनः again and पुनः again वशं sway आपद्यते attains मे Mine

  
The Hereafter never reveals itself to a person devoid of discrimination, heedless and perplexed by the delusion of wealth. ‘This world alone exists,’ he thinks, ‘and there is no other.’ Again and again he comes under my sway.

  
The word ‘*samparAyaH*’ in the above mantra means ‘the other world’ attainable after the fall of this body. ‘*sAmparAyaH*’ is the means of attaining that other world. All believers know, from the words of the scripture, that the present world is only a temporary one where they stay for a while and go to one or the other world. This possibility granted, a wise one would put effort to go to any higher world; higher in the sense of better bodily means, and better enjoyments. However, in order to aspire and work for the higher worlds one has to have a certain kind of dispassion for the joys of this world. The mantra says that those engrossed in this world itself tied down by their attachment to wealth, children, cattle, etc. will not rise to the level of aspiring for the higher worlds. Such a one is called a ‘child’, one who lacks maturity for higher things. They think ‘this world alone, that abounds with women, food, drink, etc. exists and not any other world that is beyond the ken of the sense organs.’ As a result of this infatuation for this world they come back to enjoy the attractions here. yama says that these people keep coming under his sway. Death and repeated birth become their lot. In between a birth and death grief is what is guaranteed to them.
