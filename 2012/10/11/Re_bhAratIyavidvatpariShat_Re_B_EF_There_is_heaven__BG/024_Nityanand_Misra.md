Minor comment - the above is to be found in the first verse after the ध्यान in श्रीरामरक्षास्तोत्रम् and not in वाल्मीकिरामायणम्.

Though it has little relevance to topic, but Goswāmī Tulsīdāsa has paid rich tributes to Vālmīki at many places and acknowledged him as as the first poet and creator of the Ramayana. Some examples from Rāmacaritamānasa -  
  
सीतारामगुणग्रामपुण्यारण्यविहरिणौ । वन्दे विशुद्धविज्ञानौकवीश्वरकपीश्वरौ ॥ बालकाण्ड मङ्गलाचरण 4.  
  
Above is a joint Vandana of Valmiki and Hanuman.  
  
ब्यास आदिकबि पुंगव नाना । जिन्ह सादर हरि सुजस बखाना ॥ 1.14.2  
चरन कमल बंदऊँ तिन्ह केरे । पुरवहुँ सकल मनोरथ मेरे ॥ 1.14.3  
  
Above is a joint Vandana of Vyasa and Valmiki.  
  
बंदऊँ मुनिपद कंजु रामायन जेहिं निरमयउ ।  
सखर सुकोमल मंजु दोष रहित दूषन सहित ॥ बालकाण्ड सोरठा 1.14 (घ).  
  
Above is a Vandana of Valmiki only.  
  
Of course the narrative of Mānasa differs from Valmiki Ramayana at several places which Tulsidas explains as "Kalpabheda".  
  
कलप भेद हरि चरित सुहाए। भाँति अनेक मुनिसन्ह गाए ॥ 1.33.7  
करिय न संसय अस उर आनी। सुनिअ कथा सादर रति मानी ॥ 1.33.8  
राम अनंत अनंत गुन अमित कथा विस्तार॥  
सुनि आचरजु न मानिहहि, जिन्ह के बिमल बिचार॥ 1.33  
  
The narrative of Manasa is much closer to that of Adhyatma Ramayana of Vyasa. The narrative of Valmiki is from Narada to Valmiki while that of Manasa is from Shiva to Parvati and then Shiva to Kakabhushundi to Yagyavalkya to Bharadvaja .... to Narharidas to Tulsidas. Just like अध्यात्मरामायण is set in उमामहेश्वरसंवाद, मानस has four parallel संवादs (उमामहेश्वरसंवाद, याज्ञवल्क्यभरद्वाजसंवाद, काकभुषुण्डिगरुडसंवाद and तुलसीदाससंतसंवाद).
