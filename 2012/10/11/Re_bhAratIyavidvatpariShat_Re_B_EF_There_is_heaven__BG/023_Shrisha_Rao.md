This time it was on the topic of the 'शास्त्रयोनित्वात्’ सूत्रम्. The Dvaita school was represented by Vidwan SrIdhara Joshi (who studied under Vidwan VijayasimhAchArya of Pune/Mumbai and now lives in Chennai). When he cited the above quoted verses as 'pramANa', (also mentioning that the mUlarAmAyaNa is available only in Brahmaloka, for which he did not cite any vaakyam) he was questioned by Dr.Mani Dravid SastrigaL (Advaita) and seconded by perhaps others 'is not the vAlmIki rAmaayaNa a pramANam?' (This question was put with the view that when we have a RAmAyaNa which is available with us, what would be the purpose of citing as pramANam the mUlaraamAyana which is inaccessible to us).  
  

To my knowledge, the मूलरामायण is considered an इतिहास and is listed among the प्रमाणs based on the authority given. It is alluded to in statements like चरितं रघुनाथस्य शतकोटिप्रविस्तरम् (which is found in the वाल्मीकिरामायण). It has however not been quoted by Madhva.  
  
My courteous response to the respected Dr. Dravid would simply be that as he, a learned scholar, is already aware, the list of प्रमाणs is not considered to change with time, even when some of them become untraceable -- as Madhva puts it, अनुत्सन्ना अपि ग्रन्था व्याकुला इति सर्वशः \| उत्सन्नाः प्रायशः सर्वे कोट्यंशोऽपि न वर्तते \|\|  
  
For instance, the extent of the Vedic corpus is given as 21 शाखाs of the RV, 100+ of the YV, 1000+ of the SV, etc., but nowhere near such numbers are available today. Should we thus go and erase these claims from the महाभाष्य, and disregard or modify the authority cited by Sudarśana Sūri and Madhva?

Thereafter there was a 'charchA' for a while which ended inconclusive.  
  

Madhva does not cite the वाल्मीकिरामायण, that is quite true, but Śankara and Rāmānuja do not seem to place it on a high pedestal either. It can be discussed why this is so (as also, e.g., why Goswāmī Tulsīdās did not more explicitly acknowledge and pay homage to his literary forebear Vālmīki), but this has limited relevance to the मूलरामायण matter.

Good for you, but your claim that "there is a prose passage of Madhva that follows in the same text, which states to the effect that the Mularamayanam is in the Vishnuloka and it had not come down" is not supported by anything this person is reported to have said. Would you be so kind as to point to the precise prose passage in the VTVN (which is where the ऋगाद्या भारतं चैव पञ्चरात्रमथाखिलम् \| मूलरामायणं चैव… quote occurs) where this is stated?

Amen!
