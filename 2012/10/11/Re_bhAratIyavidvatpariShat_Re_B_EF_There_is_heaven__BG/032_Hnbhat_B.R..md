Rightly said. The topic started whether there is heaven and hell or is it a myth. It jumped into Vaikuntha, Kailasa, Brahmaloka and rambling with the existence of Mularamayana said to be either in Vaikuntha or Brahmaloka (not confirmed) and the rambling about it exists in our forum whether all these exist or not and continued still.

  

I am not sure whether this type of discussion makes our forum a heaven or hell. I leave it to the readers to decide and scholars to maintain proper status. I too am constrained to write this.

  

Pardons for penning down my thought.
