*" Acharya Madhva also cautioned in his *Tattva-Viveka* "Never accept as authority the words of any humans-- for humans can be deluded or deceive."*  
  

But the same Madhvacharya says (in the Vishnutattvavinirnaya ??), that there is another Ramayana, called Mularamayanam, which is the source of others, that exists only in Vishnuloka (Vaikuntha ?) and which has not come down to this world.
