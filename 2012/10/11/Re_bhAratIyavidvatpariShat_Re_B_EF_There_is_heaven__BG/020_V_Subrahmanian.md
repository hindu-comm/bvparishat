Namaste  
  
  
Here is what happened at that meet. About three months ago there was a 'meet' of all the three schools at MannArguDi, Tamil Nadu, which is organized periodically by an institution. This time it was on the topic of the 'शास्त्रयोनित्वात्’ सूत्रम्. The Dvaita school was represented by Vidwan SrIdhara Joshi (who studied under Vidwan VijayasimhAchArya of Pune/Mumbai and now lives in Chennai). When he cited the above quoted verses as 'pramANa', (also mentioning that the mUlarAmAyaNa is available only in **Brahmaloka**, for which he did not cite any vaakyam) he was questioned by Dr.Mani Dravid SastrigaL (Advaita) and seconded by perhaps others 'is not the vAlmIki rAmaayaNa a pramANam?' (This question was put with the view that when we have a RAmAyaNa which is available with us, what would be the purpose of citing as pramANam the mUlaraamAyana which is inaccessible to us). The scholar reportedly replied: 'it is not considered a pramANam since there (in the vAlmiki Ramayanam) Sri Rama is presented as someone who is very miserable (duHkhitaH), like having had to live in the forests, separation from wife, etc.'. Upon this he was questioned: 'how can we be sure that BhagavAn is not presented so in the mUlarAmAyaNa since nobody has access to it?' Thereafter there was a 'charchA' for a while which ended inconclusive.
