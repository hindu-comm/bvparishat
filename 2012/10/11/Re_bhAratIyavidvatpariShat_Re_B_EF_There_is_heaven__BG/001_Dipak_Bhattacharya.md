According to the Paṇi hymn (RV 10.108) the abode of the gods was on the bank of the Rasā (Av. Raŋhā) (Araxes or Jaxartes = Sir Darya according to some scholars). Xwarzem (*svar-jman*) belongs to the mouth of the Jaxartes. That is one of the few early mentions of the location of Svarga. The Taittirīya-Āraṇyaka too speaks of the erect inexhaustible source of light related to the Kaśyapa as the ‘eighth’. Its location is not so clear.
