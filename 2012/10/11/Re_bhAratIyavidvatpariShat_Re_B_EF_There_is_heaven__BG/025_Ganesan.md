    For instance, the extent of the Vedic corpus is given as 21 शाखाs of the RV, 100+ of the YV, 1000+ of the SV, etc., but nowhere near such numbers are available today.  Should we thus go and erase these claims from the महाभाष्य, and disregard or modify the authority cited by Sudarśana Sūri and Madhva?"

  

In the case of Vedic Sakha-s, though all of them do not exist now, at least some are available in each of the Veda-s. So one is saved of "erasing these claims from महाभाष्य, and disregard or modify the authority cited by Sudarśana Sūri and Madhva".  
  
But, in the case of MuularaamaayaNam, an unknown and unheard of text which is supposed to exist only in Brahmaloka, how to account for it as a PramaaNa ??  
That is the question here.  
Ganesan

Upon this he was questioned: 'how can we be sure that BhagavAn is not presented so in the mUlarAmAyaNa since nobody has access to it?'  Thereafter there was a 'charchA' for a while which ended inconclusive.  
> >     Madhva does not cite the वाल्मीकिरामायण, that is quite true, but Śankara and Rāmānuja do not seem to place it on a high pedestal either.  It can be discussed why this is so (as also, e.g., why Goswāmī Tulsīdās did not more explicitly acknowledge and pay homage to his literary forebear Vālmīki), but this has limited relevance to the मूलरामायण matter. >
