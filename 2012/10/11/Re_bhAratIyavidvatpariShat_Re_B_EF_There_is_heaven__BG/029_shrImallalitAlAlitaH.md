It appears that Ganesan is missing something while saying that existence is unknown.  
As we know we can't talk about totally unknown things, so just talking sites that mUlarAmAyaNa its known to us.  
The means by which we came to know it is the pramANa for proving it.  
Now, I think others will go further to create more valid objection.
