Hari OM!



As a silent observer of the ongoing discussions it just amuses me to note how even erudite scholars sometimes have ants in their pants,

use language that reflects intolerance to other's views, play hardball over trivial issuesandconvert the discussions to verbal jamboree!



What a party pooper!
