Dear Shri Misra,  
  
Here is an extract from a 'tattvavAda' (Madhva philosophy) site:  
  
<https://sites.google.com/site/tattvavada/apaurusheyatva>  
  

//After offering his salutations to Lord Vishnu, Srimad Acharya enlists his pramANAs (based on Brahmanda Purana)

 R^igAdyAbhArataM chaiva paJNchArAtramathAkhilam.h \|  
 mUlarAmAyaNaM chaiva purANaM chaitadAtmakam.h \|\|

The Vedas, Mahabharata, **Mula-ramayana (different from Valmiki Ramayana)** and Pancharatraas are held as authoritative and as valid sources of knowledge.//

End of extract.
