Not so; the exact quote is:  
  
ऋगाद्या भारतं चैव पञ्चरात्रमथाखिलम् \|  
मूलरामायणं चैव पुराणं चैतदात्मकम् \|\|  

..................  

इति ब्रह्माण्डे \|  
  
  

But there is a prose passage of Madhva that follows in the same text,  
which states to the effect that the Mularamayanam is in the Vishnuloka  
and it had not come down.  
For, as stated in the reply, the same question had been raised by  
another scholar.  
Better to verify.
