Just making an additional reference:  
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rama>  
  
// The followers of [Madhvacharya](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madhvacharya "Madhvacharya") believe that an older version of the Ramayana, the mula-Ramayana, previously existed but is no longer extant. They consider it to be more authoritative than the version by [Valmiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valmiki "Valmiki"). //
