Not so: Madhva says (as do other Vedantins) that पौरुषेय texts are not authoritative \*in respect of अतीन्द्रिय entities like धर्म and अधर्म\*, but he does not generally classify all पौरुषेय works as generically non-authoritative -- this is in fact contrary to the doctrine of प्रामाण्य स्वतस्त्व. He also does not distinguish between human and non-human authors in this regard -- even बौद्ध and शैव texts whose authors are not considered to be human, are considered non-authoritative for being at variance with the अपौरुषेय texts.

Yes.

Not so; the exact quote is:  
  
ऋगाद्या भारतं चैव पञ्चरात्रमथाखिलम् \|  
मूलरामायणं चैव पुराणं चैतदात्मकम् \|\|  
ये चानुयायिनस्त्वेषां सर्वे ते च सदागमाः \|  
दुरागमास्तदन्ये ये तैर्न ज्ञेयो जनार्दनः \|\|  
ज्ञेय एतैस्सदायुक्तैर्भक्तिमद्भिः सुनिष्ठितैः \|\|  
न च केवलतर्केण नाक्षजेन न केनचित् \|  
केवलागमविज्ञेयो भक्तैरेव न चान्यथा \|\| इति ब्रह्माण्डे \|  

  
\> If this work has not come down to this world, there is no way anybody knows its content. Nor can anyone verify its being the source of the vAlmIki rAmAyaNam. Therefore its utility value for humans of this world is zero. Actually a scholar raised this question in an assembly.  
  

That scholar should have been told that it is necessary to first cross-check one's facts; there is no end to the needless speculation one can enter into on the basis of fanciful suppositions!
