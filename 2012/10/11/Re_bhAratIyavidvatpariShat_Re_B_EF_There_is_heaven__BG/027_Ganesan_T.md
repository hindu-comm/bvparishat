Whether it occurred in Brahmaloka or anywhere else, how can it be a Pramana, when its very existence is "unheard of and unknown"'. That is the question.  

  
You should follow the crux of the argument.  
  
When Madhva himself did not care to prove its existence, and not even the Dvaita scholar in the said assembly, it is the least botheration for anybody else !!!
