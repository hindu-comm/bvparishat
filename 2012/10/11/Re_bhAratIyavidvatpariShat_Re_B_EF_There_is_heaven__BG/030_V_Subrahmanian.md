I had responded to this thread for the first time only upon seeing your mention of the mUlarAmAyaNa existing in Vishnuloka, since I recalled the Mannargudi incident where the **Dvaita scholar had said that the work exists only in Brahmaloka.** The debate there had started **only** because of this claim and not on the mere mention of the verses cited from the brahmAnda purana.  
  
There is nothing wrong in some objects being in other lokas and their mention being made in our loka. For instance the pArijAta, the kAmadhenu, the kalpavRkSha, the airAvata etc. are objects of other worlds but their mention is made in our loka. There is no way we can make use of these here.
