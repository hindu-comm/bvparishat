Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



Since subject of Heaven appeared in posting of a professor from Harvard, I have an interesting question. Where first time words Vaikuntha (as abode of Vis'nu) and Kailas (as abode of Shiva) appear in the ancient scrptures of India? To the best of my knowledge there is frequent mention of Svargaloka in Vedic literature (including Upanisadas) but no mention of Vaikuntha and Kailasa. I may be corrected if I were wrong. Also two gardens of Heaven appear -First Nanadana-vana
and second SidhrakAvana.Were these gardens located in ancient subcontinent or outside? Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
