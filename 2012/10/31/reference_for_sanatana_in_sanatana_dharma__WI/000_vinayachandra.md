Dear All,

  

We have heard the expressions like 'cira purAtana', 'nitya nUtana' etc while describing sanAtana dharma. The term 'sanAtana' means eternal with sanA = sadA. Will the same term convey that it is eternal and ever fresh? if so, is there any textual reference and if not are there any other sources and references from where the 'eternal and yet ever fresh' nature of sanAtana dharma is spoken about?
