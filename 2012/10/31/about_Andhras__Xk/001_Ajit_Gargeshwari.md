Namaste,  
  
To start with you must read standard History Books wrtten by Majumdar and refer to Bibilography mentioned.  
Please visit Digital Library of India or [archive.org](http://archive.org) to get books on Andhars and their origin.  
  
  
'Ancient tribes of India' by Bimala Churn Law doesn't cover the period of Andhras and hence it is not mentioned in that Book
