श्रीशंकर-s commentary there reads

  

चाणूरनामानम् अन्ध्रं निषूदितवान् इति चाणूरान्ध्रनिषूदनः।

  

Here is some mention of Andhra-s as ancient tribes:

3\. Andhra (अन्ध्र) - A very ancient tribe mentioned as Dasyus in the Aitareya Brahmana (VII.18), as the result of a curse by Vishwamitra. Linked with Pulinda, Khasa, Nishada and other low peoples, they fought for Duryodhana (VIII. 51.17). The Mbh. (XII.200.40) describes them as natives of the south. (VI.10.48)

The blog writer tries to identify them with Jats. The references in his notes may be verified.
