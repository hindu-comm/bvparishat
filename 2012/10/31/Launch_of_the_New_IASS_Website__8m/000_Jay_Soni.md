Dear Friends, Colleagues and Fellow Members of the Parishat

  

On behalf of the IASS, the International Association of Sanskrit Studies, it is a great pleasure to announce that our new Website was launched on VIJAYADASHAMI, Wednesday, 24th October 2012.

  

To repeat what the site says: The IASS expressly thanks the INDOLOGY website and its founder Dominik Wujastyk for hosting the website of the IASS between 2001 and 2008, and the Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan and its Vice-Chancellors Professors V. Kutumba Sastry and R. V. Tripathi for hosting it between 2008 and 2012.

  

We also thank Dr Heike Moser for allowing us to use 2 photographs by her on Kutiyattam, and Dr Amarjiva Lochan for the others.

  

The site will be pleased to greet you here:

Namaste.

  

Jayendra
