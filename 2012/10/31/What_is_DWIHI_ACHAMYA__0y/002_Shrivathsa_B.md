dvirAcamya = having sipped water twice. i.e. doing Acamana twice.  
Acamana is done using various mantras. Each sampradAya has a different one.  
  
the Acamana which one may follow is:  
Please note that the whole procedure below counts for one Acamana. For dvirAcamana, you will have to repeat steps 1 to 10 twice.  
1. acyutAya namaH (take water in uddaraNi from left hand and pour it into your right palm which has been made into gokarNAkR^iti and take one sip of water)  
2. anantAya namaH (another sip)  
3. govindAya namaH (another sip)  
  
This is followed by ritual touching of various parts of the body along with chanting bhagavaan's name (in case of bilateral organs, the right side is touched first)  
4. keshava nArAyaNa (cheeks, using tip of right thumb)  
5. mAdhava govinda (eyes, using tip of right ring finger)  
6. viShNu madhusUdana (nose, both sides, using tip of right index finger)  
7. trivikrama vAmana (ears using tip of right small finger )  
8. shrIdhara hR^iShiikesha (shoulders using tip of right middle finger)  
9. padmanAbha (navel i.e. nAbhi using tips of all five right fingers combined)  
10. dAmodara (top of head, using tips of all five right fingers combined).  
  
 This is one form of Acamana. There are several variants of it.  
 Acamana is prescribed after every possible bodily pollution (after defecation, urination etc.) or in the case of special purification (Acamana after taking bath, or Acamana before pUja, before accepting dAna etc.). It is also prescribed after finishing food etc. some times one has to do dvirAcamana (Acamana twice), or trirAcamana (thrice). The idea of Acamana is that bhagavaan's name purifies us.
