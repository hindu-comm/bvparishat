There is also a 'त्रिराचामेत्’ (three times Achamanam). This occurs in the 'brahmayajnam' where after sipping water thrice **no** touching of various parts (accompanied by uttering the various names of Lord Vishnu) of the body follows. There is a difference between shrautAchamanam and the ordinary Achamanam. I think the त्रिराचामेत् is shrautAchamanam.
