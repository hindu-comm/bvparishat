In many प्रयोग contexts, आचम्य, प्राणानायम्य, etc. are directions as commonly understood without any specific direction twice or thrice.

  

The other usage is अप उपस्पृश्य,उपस्पृश्य are also to be found as taken understood it relates to अपः just like आचम्य. The remaining may vary according to the context of the rite as required by the स्मृति texts.

  

उपस्पृश्य द्विजो नित्यमन्नमद्यात् समाहितः \| भुक्त्वा चौपस्पृशेत् सम्यगद्भिः खानि च स्पृशेत्

  

I do have my own स्मृति (memory) of hearing both

  

ऋग्वेदाय स्वाहा।

यजुर्वेदाय स्वाहा।

सामवेदाय स्वाहा।

  

अथर्ववेदाय नमः।

इतिहासपुराणाभ्यां नमः।

  

of which the first three are for sipping water and the last for touching the limbs eyes and ears.

  

The same with the names of विष्णु are recited as given by श्रीवत्स, which also I have noticed. But I am not sure of a single आचमन contains three times sipping and remaining with touching the limbs with water.

  

  

  

Hence both comprise आचमन or उपस्पर्श making them synonyms in the कोश-s like अमर. The above text itself contains three times sipping water and makes one आचमन. Now, when द्विराचम्य means it makes the आचमन completely repeated twice and it is normal. त्रिराचम्य also means the same, literally sipping three times and makes one आचमन complete. Now, taking both the views, they will be ratified with the स्मृति, प्रयोग, धर्मसूत्र texts which require the number of आचमन-s.

  

I am not acquainted with any text and hence I am not entering into the discussion whether it be single (least possible), twice or thrice. The question was asked without any context given, means performing आचमन twice (not literal meaning of sipping water).

  

And the mantra-s also may differ following regional variations.
