5-4-17 संख्यायाः क्रियाऽभ्यावृत्तिगणने कृत्वसुच् ।

5-4-18 द्वित्रिचतुर्भ्यः सुच् ।

  

The above explains the meaning of the word द्विः twice, an अव्यय, derived from the number द्वि. आचम्य - आ+चमु भक्षणे - क्त्वा \> ल्यप् - आचम्य - after having drunk (water).

  

I hope the ritual आचमन accompanying any ritual normally to purify before beginning any ritual. I think this is a rough explanation, but better is understood who practice daily rituals.
