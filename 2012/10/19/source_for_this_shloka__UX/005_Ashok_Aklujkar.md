Up to almost two-thirds of the way I took the verse as Dr. Kanan does. For the remaining my suggestion can be gathered from the following statement (not a literal translation);

  

If one gives more than what a family needs for eating and clothing -- more than meeting two of the three basic needs as we think of them nowadays: food, clothes and place to stay or roof over the head -- that is like relish of honey, (but) later it is really poison (because there is good chance that the family may give up effort or puru.sakaara and become lazy). The merit acquired by the donor (then becomes) otherwise, that is, non-merit or demerit.

  

madhv-aasvaada and [vi.sa](http://vi.sa) can be taken either way, as applicable to the family or the donor. The excessive charity may harm the family spirit or cause regret for the donor.

  

If the context in which the verse occurs is provided, we may be able to arrive at a more precise understanding.  

  

  

a.a.
