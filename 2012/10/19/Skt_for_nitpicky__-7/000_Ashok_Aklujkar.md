Vidyasankar Sundaresan asked:

  

\>What would be a good, pithy Sanskrit word for nitpicky?\<

  

I would suggest k.sudracit, tucchacit, and gau.nacit on the pattern of agnicit etc. These are to be used by considering the degree of negativity intended.

  

In some contexts, we may substitute -cit with -graahin, -udgraahin, -uddhart.r or v.rt (from v.r, 5th class, 'to select, to choose').

  

We have to coin new words. Sanskrit has traditionally done that superbly. We should continue the tradition for the good of not only Sanskrit but also other Indian languages.

  

A new coinage sounds strange until one utters it three times. Modern Indians are losing their languages by not trying for three seconds.

  

Second principle to remember is that words acquire their precise meanings through use and context. There is no \*absolutely\* fixed thing such as word meaning.
