Dear Dr.Deepak Bhattacharya,

 With reference to your query about Dattatreya Cult,I have to inform you as under:

 Like the Ganesha Cult,the Dattatreya Cult also is very popular in Maharashtra and its adjoining States like Karnataka,Gujarat etc. In Marathi,there are many books on Dattatreya like Datta-Kosha by P.N.Joshi and books on the Datta-followers like Nrisimha Sarasvati,Vasudevananda Sarasvati alias Tembe Swami.One of my oldfriends,Dr.H.S.Joshi of Baroda has written a Thesis in Englishon Dattatreya,which could be available in Oriental Institute,Baroda (where I was working before coming over to Bangalore).You may get this book/its xerox-copy andaddress of Dr Joshi from the Incharge Director,Oriental Institute,M.S.University of Baroda,opposite Palace Gate,Palace Road,Vadodara-390001-Gujarat.Moreover,if you write to the Librarian of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute,Pune-411004 as well as to the Librarian of the Bombay University Library,Justice Ranade Bhavan,Vidyanagari Campus,Kalina,Santacruz(East),Mumbai-400098 and to the Librarian of the Central Library or the Asiatic Society,Mumbai, Town Hall,Opposite Horniman Circle,M.G.Road,Mumbay-400023,you will get a fund of information about theDattatreya-cult and the books related to it and written in different Indian languages.

I wish you success in your new venture.
