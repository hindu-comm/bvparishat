Techical terminology  
  
I was talking about this problem for a long time. I talked to Pune  
University scholars about this. Now there was discussion here on  
Ganita of Bhaskaracarya(?). If I remember he used Shrutipatha for  
hypotenuse and other used KarNa.But it looks to me there is not enough  
interest to discuss ancient technical terminology here on BVP  
list.Thanks.N.R.Joshi
