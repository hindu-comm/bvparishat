I just happened to go thru a Blog article by Himanshu Guru :



<http://himanshu-guru.blogspot.in/2011/12/spirituality-draupadi-was-pure-despite.html>



Wherein he divinates the Draupadi episode as an avatara of Goddesses.
He maintains that



Draupadi was pure in spite of the 'Polyandry' tag and gives out the reasons as follows :





It has always been a debate how Draupadi could be assumed chaste even after having five husbands. She is also revered as one of the ‘great five virgins’ (pancha satee) of mythology by uttering whose names all sins gets excused by its virtuous influence. The reasons are described herewith.  
  
1) As per Narada and Vayu Puranas, Draupadi was composite Avatar of Goddesses Shyamala (wife of Dharma), Bharati (Wife of Vayu), Sachi (wife of Indra), and Usha (wife of Ashwinis) and hence married their earthly counterparts in the form of the five Pandavas and so there is nothing to question her chastity.   
  
2) Draupadi was also avatar of Goddess Shree or Wealth who was joint wife to five Indras, the Five Pandavas. She was to be born several times for imprisoning the Indras. First time was as Vedavati who cursed Ravana (who is another goddess Avatar Swaha, wife to Agni). She then came again as Maya-Sita especially to take revenge from Ravana while Agni hid the real Sita. Third one was partial either Damyanti (whose husband Nala was equivalent to Dharma, Vayu, Indra just like the Pandavas) and her daughter Nalayani. She married Sage Mudgala. The fifth avatar was Draupadi herself. So we find in Draupadi, a composite avatar of Kali, Parvati, Sachi, Shyamala, Usha, Bharati, Shree, Swaha, the eight goddesses.

  

Hence, Draupadi could be taken to be granted as an icon of chastity even though practicing polyandry.
