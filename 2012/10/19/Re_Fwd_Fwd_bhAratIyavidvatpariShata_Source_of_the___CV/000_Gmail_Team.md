Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



Tara wife of Brihaspati begot son Budha from Chandra, Budha planet was also known in the Middle-East by the name Vrika (wolf). Turkish people think that they are descendants of wolf. Surprisingly wolves turning their face towards full moon cry.



Atrikula was subbranch of Vrika kula. It is said that Dattatraya was the son of Atri and AnaUyA from blessings of three gods, Indra, Chandra and one more. But I read that the daughter of Atri ApALA had skin disease, So her husband disowned her. Indra made her better.



Was ApAlA then sister of Datta?



Any way Vrika kula and Lunar dynasty (started from Budha) were somehow related. I may be corrected if somebody has better and correct information. Thanks. NRJOSHI

Namaskar Dr Bhat,



Hear are my thoughts on - Tara



Tara was bR^ihaspatii's wife who bore a son (budha) from Chandra (The Moon) (padma puraaNa).



If one takes the story literally then, again "Tara" having had children from other than her husband was not acceptable.



For this reason Tara may have been included in the group of Five Maidens that can potentially serve as a reminder for future generations in a illustrative pictorial manner.



For this reasons I compare the Maidens to the LIGHT HOUSE that provide warning to future travelers.



Just some thoughts to consider.



Best Rgds,



Dr Yadu
