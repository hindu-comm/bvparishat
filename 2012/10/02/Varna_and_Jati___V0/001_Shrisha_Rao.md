Others will have to clarify the etymology, but neither word means "caste" in the primary sense. जाति is better understood as denoting a "class" or a "set," with a व्यक्ति being a member of the class. For instance, all objects with the property of घटत्व form a जाति, the set of pots, whilst a particular घट is a व्यक्ति.  
  
The word वर्ण means "color" in the primary sense, and is the basis for the Kannada word ಬಣ್ಣ (baNNa) which means the same. Its use in a social context is metaphorical.
