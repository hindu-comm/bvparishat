Namaste Scholars !



Recently I had a discussion with scholar regarding Varna and Jati. In general parlance people loosely translate varna as caste and also Jati as caste.



Now, what is etymology of these both words, also even in chapter 1.41 of Geeta, there is mention of Varna and Jati.



When it comes to Varna there is enough discusiion, but Jati all human beings techincally belong to one Jati..isnt it..?



As there are four Varnas as discussed...how many Jatis are there ? and what is the relationship of Jati and Varna if any ?



Any reference in this regard will be particularly helpful.



Aum Swasti,

Santosh
