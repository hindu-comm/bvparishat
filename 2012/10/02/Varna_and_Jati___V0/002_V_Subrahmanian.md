Namaste  
  
I think in the Bhagavadgita context the traditional Acharya-s have maintained that jAti and varNa mean the same, synonymously. For example in the commentary for the BG 1.42 where occur these terms: जातिधर्माः कुलधर्माश्च the MadhusUdanI vyAkhyA (गूढार्थदीपिका) says: जातिधर्माः क्षत्रियत्वादिनिबन्धाः, कुलधर्माः असाधारणाश्च.. In the BG 4.13 verse where चातुर्वर्ण्यम् is mentioned the commentary is on the lines of brAhmaNa, kShatriya, etc. citing the Purusha sUktam: ब्राह्मणोऽस्य मुखमासीत्’ and cross-referencing with the BG 18.42 शमो दमस्तपः..’ of brahmaNa karma.  
  
There is a verse in the विवेकचूडामणिः said to be of Shankaracharya which says:  
  
जातिनीतिकुलगोत्रदूरगं....  
  
for which the commentary by HH Sri Chandarshekhara Bharati SwaminaH of Sringeri says: ब्राह्मण्यादिजातेः...  
  
From these references we may conclude that the tradition has not differentiated between the terms 'jaati' and 'varNa'.
