Respected Scholars,

Hari Om! Salutations.  
  

Would like to know the derivation of the following two words:

1\. प्रायश्चित्त in the meaning of expiatory actions

2\. प्रत्यवाय in the meaning of the pāpa occurring from the non-performance of nityakarma

Grateful for the assistance available in this forum.

  

In Shri Guru Smriti,  
Advayananda
