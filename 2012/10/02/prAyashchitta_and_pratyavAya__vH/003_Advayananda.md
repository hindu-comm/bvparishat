Respected Sri Naryananji,

Hari Om! Salutations.  
  

Grateful for your explanations on प्रायश्चित्त and प्रत्यवाय.

I do not understand the wordप्रत्यवाय्यते. I do understand it has the root 'ay' (to go) with upasargas 'prati' and 'ava'. But with these two upasargas what does the formation 'pratyavāyyate' mean? Can you please clarify. Thank you very much.

  

In Shri Guru Smriti,  
Advayananda
