Respected Swamiji,  
Namaskar. Let us check the term pratyavāyaḥ which has been derived through the etymolgy of pratyavāyate pratyvagacchati iti pratyavāyaḥ pratyavagamanam pāpam, as the verb pratyavāyate is from the combinations of the prepositions prati and ava followed by the root aya (gati-movement) in Ātmanepada to form prati + ava + ay + a (group infix) + t (substituted verb suffix to l ) + e (additional affix t-ending Ātmanepada) to make it an active derivation of pratyavāyate (precisely a negative learning or understanding leads to the meaning of sin). This is the kartṛvyutpattiḥ or the active derivation.  
Now, the term pratyavāyaḥ which could also be derived through the etymolgy of pratyavāyyate, a passive derivation with the combinations of the prepositions prati and ava followed by the root aya (gati-movement) in Ātmanepada to form prati + ava + ay + a (group infix) + t (substituted verb suffix to l ) + e (additional affix t-ending Ātmanepada) and a passive (either bhāva or karman, the ś eliding verb suffixes) infix called y (sārvadhātuke yak-3.1.67) is attached to the root part ay, and it will be: prati + ava + ay + y + a (group infix) + t (substituted verb suffix to l ) + e (additional affix t-ending Ātmanepada) to make it pratyavāyyate (is being a negative learning or understanding leads to the meaning of sin). It is pratyavāyyate iti pratyavāyaḥ pāpam. Here it is the bhāvavyutpattiḥ or the passive derivation where the transitivity of the verbal root is not intended. The meanings of prepositions prati and ava etc. change according to the circumstances.  
There is still debate over the literal meanings and the suggestion status of prepositions. The twenty-two prepositions in different combinations will yield many a number of verbs and nouns possible and the meanings are understood from the lexicon or the usages of eminent people like Vālmīki, Vyāsa etc.  
Regards,  
Narayanan
