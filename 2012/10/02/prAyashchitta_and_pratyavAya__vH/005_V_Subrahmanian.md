Namaste  
  
Here are some details about the 'kRcchra' penance. Shri Anand Hudli, a member of this forum has provided these links to his posts in another forum in the past:

The ChAndrAyana vrata is detailed in these sources:

**CHANDRAYAN VRATA-** It's an important austerity lasting for a month which commences on First day of the bright half of a month by observing fast for the whole day and breaking it in the night with one morsel of food. On the next day, i.e. 'dwitiya' one morsel of food is increased which means that instead of one morsel of food now two morsels are taken. This way one morsel of food is increased on each of the following days till the fourteenth day (chaturdashi) when the fast is broken by having fourteen morsels of food. A total fast is observed on 'Amavasya' (dark moon). On the next day i.e. first day of the dark half of the month one morsel is decreased which means that the devotee should break his fast with thirteen morsels of food. This way one morsel is decreased on each successive day till 'chaturdashi' when a devotee breaks his fast by having only one morsel of food. This is the way, how a Chandrayan vrata should be observed.  
  
Manu Smriti is a good source here.  
  
I thank Shri Anand Hudli ji for providing the links.
