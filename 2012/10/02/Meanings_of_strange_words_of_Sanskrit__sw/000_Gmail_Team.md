Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



First thanks to all scholars-Dr. Narang, Dr. Narayanan, Dr. Subra V and Nityananad Misra for helping me in case of meanings of Arambha and PrArambha.



Now Panini did ot have ळ् in his grammar, But we find its use in Veda. So I could not figure out meanings of these words. Apte's dictionar is of no help. Please help. Thanks. N.R.Joshi



Rigveda (10/14/16 and 6/47/3) has word षळुर्वी.



What is its meaning ? Is it षट्+उर्वी



Similarly we have in Mantra pus'panjali एकराळिति



What is its meaning? Is it एकराट्+इति



In Rgveda ईडे becomes ईळेand मीढुषे becomes मीळ्हुषे



What is the meaning of मीढुषे?



Why retroflex sounds are changed into ळ् and ळ्ह्?



Panini did not refer to them I think.



Please help. Thanks. N.R.Joshi
