Here is the reply by DK Bhattacharya, separated from the topic in the link given in my previous for some reason:

A note: These retroflexes are governed by प्रतिशाख्य grammars which deal with mostly with the recitation of the letters and lay down the rules regarding them in संहिता or पदपाठ, which is considered to be the प्रकृति of the text. These and some other phonetic changes found in Vedic संहिता-s are not governed by Panini, with his rules for Sandhi. These also differ from the शाखा, of the संहिता-s, and division of Veda-s. Some have more complicated phonetic changes preserved in प्रातिशाख्य-s.
