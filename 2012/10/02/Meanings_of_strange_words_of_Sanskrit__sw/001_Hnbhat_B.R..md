I am not trying to explain the meanings of the words from Veda quoted out of their context. Better we can refer to the commentaries available or look into the Modern Translations or classical ones for their meaning. For, the commentators rely on the Nirukta and Nighantu for the Vedic words supported by Brahmana texts for the explanation of the words, and the classical modern commentators rely on the other texts like Zend Avesta and the so called Proto Indo European Langauge etymologies. Recent ones rely on their own interpretation on the words as they conceive the words to be conveying. I have no opinion about it.

  

The issue of the two were discussed in the following thread long ago.

Please go through and doubts if any from among the opinions from different scholars there, would be discussed in continuation here.

  

With regards
