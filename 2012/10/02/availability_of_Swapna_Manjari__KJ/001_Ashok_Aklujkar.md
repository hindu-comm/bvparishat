I do not know about the availability of A-G's work. However, there are a few works specifically regarding the dream phenomenon in Skt. See the bibliography in the following article for a start.  
  
Houben, J.E.M. 2009. "A song against bad dreams: magic, superstition or psychology?" In The Indian Night: Sleep and Dream in Indian Culture, (ed) Bautze-Picron, Claudine. New Delhi: Rupa & Co.  
  
Looking up the CC or the NCC under svapna will also help. Some [jyoti.sa/jyauti.sa](http://jyoti.sa/jyauti.sa) and ;sakuna granthas also have dream discussions.  
  
This genre of literature was probably known with the term svapna-vipaaka in ancient India.
