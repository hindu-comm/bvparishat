Dear scholars,

Dreams-It's an interesting topic.

I too would like to know about the availability of the text of Svapna Manjari written by Abhinavagupta.

One of my research students is about to launch his research project on the topic

' Treatment of Dreams in Indian philosophy'.

Any suggestions, comments and directions would be a great help for us.

Incidentally prof. Jan E. M. Houben was with us today in our Department (Dept. of Sanskrit, University of Calicut,Kerala).

He made a nice presentation on the topic " Landmarks in the history of Vyakarana".

With pranams,

N.K.S
