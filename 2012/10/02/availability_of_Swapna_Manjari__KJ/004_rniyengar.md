Dear Scholars,  
There are several texts on dreams, like the one posted by  
Dr.Narayanan. On 15 January I posted the following information. I can  
share AV Parisishta if some one is interested.

Namaste!  
Any research on ‘Svapna’ in Sanskrit literature would be incomplete  
without studying the Adbhuta-saagara of Ballaala Sena. The  
“Svapnaadbhuta” chapter in this book is 24 pages long in print.  
Ballala gives all information about ‘dream interpretation’ as it  
existed in his time (10-11 Cent AD). He gives original quotations  
from  
Parashara, several puranas, Ramayana, MBh, Varaha-mihira, Charaka,  
Sushruta, and many other less known sources. There is one more source  
namely the Atharvaveda Parishishta. This text has a long chapter (no.  
68) titled Svapnaadhyaayah. This proposes a relationship between  
body-  
types (vaata-pitta-kapha),Nava-grahas and the dreams. Since my focus  
is not in Ayurveda I have not studied this chapter closely, but the  
contents are quite interesting. I would like to be enlightened by  
shcolars whether the above text (AVP) is older than the canonical  
Ayurvedic texts. In any case the above two texts would be good  
references for those working on how ancient Indians discussed and  
handled dreams. I understand at the SVYASA University, Bangalore  
considerable scientific research is going on about "sleep states"  
combining Yoga and modern methods of analysis.
