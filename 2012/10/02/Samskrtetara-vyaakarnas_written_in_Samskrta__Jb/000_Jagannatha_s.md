These are some of the Samskrtetara-grammar works composed in Samskrta.

      Prakrta section of Siddha-hema-shabdaanushaasana by Hemachandra

Telugu: AndhraShabdaChintamani by Nannayabhatta

Malayalam: Leelaatilakam (Author ?)

KaashmiiraShabdaamritam(?)

JainaKaumudii(An Ardhamaagadhi grammar by a Jaina monk)

I heard somewhere that recently a scholar of Maharashtra( the author of Kantakanjali ?) edited a work of Marathi Grammar written in Samskrta.

I request the scholars to shed more light on these works.

(I think this topic is remotely related to the thread,*Telugu Terms for vowels and consonants* started by Sri Nityanand Misra)
