Dear Scholars,  
  
In 18th century, from Azhwar Tirunagari town in Tamilnadu, there was a  
scholar by name Subrahmanya Dikshita. He wrote a book on Tamil grammar  
and named it as "Prayoga Vivekam". Though the book is written in  
Tamil, it closely follows the Paniniyan Grammar. The author uses  
Tamilized words such as sandhiyakkaram (sandhi aksharam), Thinngantha  
Vinai (Tinganta), chanda, Adesha etc. for denoting grammatical  
concepts.  
  
The author's contention was Tamil Grammar and Sanskrit Grammar are  
similar. However he was repeatedly refuted by other Tamil scholars  
during and after his time.  
  
Prayoga Vivekam is available in DLI:

Thanks,  
Srikanth.
