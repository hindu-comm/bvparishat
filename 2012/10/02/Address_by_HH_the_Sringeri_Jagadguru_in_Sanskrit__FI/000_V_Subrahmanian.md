Namaste  
  
Here is the link from where one can listen to the address by the Sringeri Jagadguru in Sanskrit at the Valedictory function of the vAkyArtha sadas at Chennai on 1.10.2012.  
  
<https://www.box.com/shared/5upwbna71mv75cjq48md>  
  
It is a talk on the history of this tradition of 'sadas' in the Sringeri Peetham, the greatness of the shAstras, etc.
