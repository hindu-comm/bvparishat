A very welcome addition to Vedic Studies and in particular to the Satarudriya sudies and commentaries.  
I would like to know whether the Sri sivarahasyam has ever been published ? Does the author belong to Kerala ?  
Some more informations about his period will very much be appreciated and useful. For, there is another voluminous Sivarahasyam of which some parts have been published from Thanjavur Sarasvati Mahal Library some years back; this Sivarahasyam has been very much cited as authority by many commentators from the 15-16 centuries; Paramasivendrasarasvati, (circa 17th century) the Guru of Sadasivabrahmendra Sarasvati of the Kanchi Samkara Math also quotes extensively from one Sivarahasyam in many of his commetaries and compilations such as Bhuutirudrakshamahimaa, etc. It will be interesting to know whether these two Sivarahsyam texts are the same or different.  
With the best wishes  
Ganesan
