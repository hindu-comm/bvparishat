The Satarudriyam chapter of the Krishnayajurveda Taittiriyasamhita has eleven Anuvaakas having the whole total of 169 mantras.  
This portion is known as the Srirudram alias Namakam. The Satarudriyam has been commented by Sayana, Bhattabhaskara, Abhinavashankara, Skandadeva and Vishnusuri etc.  
There are 242 classical verses on the Satarudriyam by Skandadeva in his Srisivarahasyam having total number of 12000 veses.  
In his commentary most of the verses are in the Sardulavikridita metre, but there are a few verses in Vasantatilaka, Upajati (of Indravajra & Upendravajra) and Harini as well.  
Following all the five commentaries of Sayana, Bhattabhaskara, Abhinavashankara, Skandadeva and Vishnusuri respectively, Dr. Nechur Krishnashastri Sundareswaran (born in 1964), Associate Professor of Sanskrit in the University of Calicut, has commented on the Satarudriyam indicating Rishi, Devata, Chandas and Dhyana with Anvaya, Artha, Vivarana and Phala seperately to each of these 169 mantras.  
The footnotes to the description regarding research point of view is worthwhile.  
The name of the Malayalam vyakhya is Rajalakshmi, by dedicating the work with loving memory to his late mother Rajalakshmi, has been published by Ganga Books Kozhikkode.  
The work has been presented with a scholarly Introductions by His Holiness Swami Tattvamayananda of the Ramakrishna Mission and by Professor Vaidyalinga Sharma as well.  
If Dr. NKS brings forward his Rajalakshmi commentary in Sanskrit with Devanagari script including Skandadeva's Srisivarahasyam (242 out of 12000) as an appendix, it will help many a number of Sanskrit scholars involved in the Vedic studies, who are deprived from Malayalam language and script due to the lack of regular practice.  
I request Dr. NKS for a Sanskrit version of his descriptive commentary to publish with ISBN code.
