hariH OM,  
Dr. ERN,  
  
 the sssbpt link is for rudra, which i have learnt already. The openlibrary link is a book written by a known saMskR^ita baiter of Karnataka by name Sham Ba Joshi (Shankar Baldixit Joshi). Hence this book cannot be the one written by Skandadeva. The Yogaorder link which you gave is another Shivarahasya by Somadeva. This book has been put up on scribd by someone. The University of Pennsylvania link talks about 22 leaves from the manuscript of Sivarahasya. I will pursue the other leads that you have given me (hard copy published by Chaukhamba). I have a contact in Chaukhamba and he should be able to help. Thanks for sending me the leads.  
  
svasti,  
 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,  

shrivathsa.
