First, I do not know if 'polyandry' is the correct word. In any case, since we have the case of Draupadi as an example, just for theoretical purpose, a question arises as to whether there will be widowhood for X when one of her husbands die. \[ In the case of a man having many wives, there is no doubt that all the wives will become widows when the husband dies.\] The possibility of their death is not ruled out since, for example in the Mahabharata itself, we find the Pandava-s, especially Bhima and Arjuna, targeted by the adversaries. Is there any mention of the case of widowhood in the hypothetical case of X? Since there was mention in this forum about the practice of 'polyandry' in the past and even in the present in some pockets in India, I raise this question here.
