Thank you Sir for the clarifications. I am reminded of watching a story on TV based on a novel of the famous Kannada writer Kuvempu (or someone else?) where a man (from the Coorgi community) in the army is believed to be killed in action, returns home after some years, fully unrecognizable owing to injuries, and finds his wife living with his elder brother whose wife has died. The story explains this as a practice called 'kUDike' (ಕೂಡಿಕೆ) perhaps an accepted/approved one.
