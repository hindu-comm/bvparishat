Nice that we are in agreement.

See what Oxford and Cambridge say for this very word 'cult':  
  
Oxford:  
  

a system of **religious veneration and devotion** directed toward a particular figure or object: *the cult of St. Olaf* \[note that there is no OR here but only AND\]*  
*

a relatively small group of people having religious beliefs or practices regarded by others as strange or sinister:  
  
Cambridge:  
  
a system of religious belief, esp. one not recognized as an established religion, or the people who worship according to such a system of belief:   
  
One can see that :  
  
1. The Oxford dictionary of the early 1900's that I have at home gives the meaning as: 'system of religious worship, devotion, homage, to person or thing. ' You can see 'how much' the word/meaning has changed over a century comparing with the above meaning I have given from the **online** Oxford dictionary.    
  
2. How the Cambridge meaning differs from the Oxford. While the O does not give a negative or derogatory sense to the word, the Cambridge does that.  
  
3. A **writer** following O will get a positive meaning for the word and use it. A **reader** following C will fault that usage.  
  
4. That shows the 'mata bheda' between/across lexicons. I am reminded of an old verse:  
  
कपिलो यदि सर्वज्ञः काणादो नेति का मतिः ।  
तावुभौ यदि सर्वज्ञौ मतभेदः कथं तयोः ॥  
  
This additional meaning given by O is also relevant:  
  
//a relatively small group of people having religious beliefs or practices regarded by others as strange or sinister://  
  
Even among those following the vaidika sampradaya, there are practices by groups that might 'look strange' for others but quite in order for the followers. Vidyaranya, in the vAsanaakshaya prakaranam of the jivanmukti viveka has given instances such as the northern brahmins faulting the southerners for marrying their sister's daughter or a girl marrying her maternal uncle. The southerners in turn accuse the northerners as eating meat. 'tapta mudrAdhAraNam' of the Madhvas and Srivaishnavas would look 'strange' for the smarta-s. I have seen many Madhwa orthodox women keeping smarta women 'at a distance' in those very rare assemblies when both happen to be present. Likewise the following of Datta, Ayyappa, even Madhwa, srivaishnava, etc. can be justifiably called 'small groups' in relation to the vast general population. And on this count it perfectly fits the name 'cult' as per the O dictionary.
 And even within smArta-s there are those who follow 'bodhayana' and are a 'small' group. Their daily 'brahmayajnam' itself is an extremely elaborate affair taking some twenty minutes with some close to 100 tarpanams. This would appear 'strange' for the other smartas. One can go on and on.  
  
And in the O additional definition the 'sinister' is only an OR. So it allows a small though non-sinister group to be called a cult.

I would prefer the name '....University for the Handicapped'
