This and your other examples have no probative value in this regard because these authors are not acknowledged as authorities of English usage, unlike Henry Watson Fowler, Eric Partridge, etc. It is against common sense to follow the lead of someone in matters where they are not authoritative; it is also against the Vedic dictum of यान्यनवद्यानि कर्माणि \| तानि सेवितव्यानि \| नो इतराणि \| यान्यस्माकं सुचरितानि \| तानि त्वयोपास्यानि \| नो इतराणि \|

The two, I submit, are one and the same: only someone who is an accepted authority of usage can be seen as not determining what is not wrong in usage. Hence we have worthies like Fowler, Partridge, etc., and their equivalents in other languages. If an argument is to be made that a usage is correct, it must be by appeal to these and the highest standards like the OED; arbitrary authors, lexicons, websites, etc., are not useful guides, lest we be described by अन्धेनैव नीयमाना यथान्धाः. This is particularly so for serious academic writers of significant virtuosity, such as the many scholars who are members of the BVP.  
  
This will be my last posting on this topic.
