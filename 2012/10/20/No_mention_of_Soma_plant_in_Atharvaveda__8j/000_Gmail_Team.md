Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



I read in the book on Vedas written by my friend in India that although Atharvaveda mentions names of many medicinal plant, it is silent on Soma plant (found in MUjavata(MUjavanta). Is this true? There are Atharvaveda scholars on this list. Please help . Thanks. N.R.Joshi
