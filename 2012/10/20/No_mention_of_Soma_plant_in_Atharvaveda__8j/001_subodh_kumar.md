I fully support the view that there is no mention of any name for Soma Plant in Vedas. In fact all references to drinking of Soma are poetically describing the imbibing of virtuous knowledge that empowers a strong motivation & tools for progress in all spheres of life.

.

**Soma: What it is and what it does**

**([subod...@gmail.com]())**

**Monier Williams (**in his great Sanskrit English Dictionary) **interprets SOMA only at physical level as a -juice, extract,(esp.)the juice of Soma plant, (also) the Soma plant itself,(said to be a climbing plant) the stalks, an अंशु anshu of which is pressed between stones by the priests, then sprinkled with water , and purified in a strainer to get Soma. Anshu अंशु however is translated by MW as a filament(especially of Soma plant);thread; end of a thread, a minute particle; a point, end;**..

....... There is an obvious incongruity in this interpretation of Soma. It will be physically a difficult / impractical task to press the thread, end of thread, a minute particle, a point of Soma plant. The entire concept of an already minute particle, to be pressed between stones, sprinkled with water and purified in a strainer is more in the realm of an imagined process and not physically feasible .

In fact Dr Nene beautifully describes the human anotomical process by which human brain processes all information as if crushing on stones and then sifts the findings for concusive decision to arrive at final wisdom. That is Soma. Dr Nene actually describes the physical features in human anatomy that work like two stones to press by and then a seive of wool like structure throgh which the pressed substance is actually strained in processing of information by human brain. 

**Thus* *in popular perception SOMA is a kind of herbal preparation, which is consumed for exhilarating/ stimulating benefits. But Soma is a lot more than a mere stimulating herbal concoction. The entire 9^(th) chapter Mandal on Pavmani Soma of Rig Veda appears to have escaped notice of MW in giving this highly limiting interpretation of Soma. Pavmani Soma signifies a non physical entity that provides the stimulant for physical action for welfare and benefit of entire creation.* ***

**Vedic Soma**

**सोमेनादित्या बलिन: सोमेना पृथिवी मही !**

**अथो नक्षत्राणामेषामुपस्थे सोम आहित: !! ऋग्वेद 10/85/2**

**Solar radiations, the greatness of earth and all the planets in the sky that support life, derive their abilities from the SOMA that is established in them.**

****

**सोमं मन्यते पपिवान्यत्संपिंषंत्योषधिम् !**

**सोमं यं ब्रह्माणो विदुर्न तस्याश्नाति कश्चन !! ऋग्वेद 10/85/3**

**Yask translates this mantra by saying-" Some chemists crush soma and then drink it , and think that they have drunk soma. This is not correct, because that is not true soma."**

**But The Soma that Learned, Scientists, Intellectuals, know of is not an edible product.**

**आच्छद्विधानैर्गुपितो बार्हते सोम रक्षित: !**

**ग्राव्णामिच्छृएवन्तिष्ठसि नते अश्नाति पार्थिव: !! ऋग्वेद 10/85/4**

**It is covered and protected by well regulated non material laws
governing in the material world .**

**Soma can not be physically consumed by a living being.**

******

**Soma in Vedic tradition thus represents essentially a non physical
mind stimulant, and drive. The motivating force for intellect and also the store of scientific knowledge from researches that act as source of capability as an enabler of actions for the welfare of the society.**

****

**Language of Vedas is often highly poetical, and does not lend to literal translations. Most of the time there is reference to soma as a medicinal creeper, to be crushed under stones and then the juices strained through sieves woven from grey woolen threads. The person who finally finds this preparation of 'SOMA' gets drunk on it. **

**In analytical research a learned competent person follows the creeper of knowledge that has grown out of seeds planted by a problem. Experts engage in efforts to find solution /explanation to that problem. Researchers pursue the minute threads and filaments from the creeper of the existing researches of human knowledge from study and observations in nature. The topics of research problem can be in any field connected with welfare /progress of the society in social, medicinal, physical sciences. The efforts and knowledge pooled by the earlier efforts is likened to the medicinal creeper that has grown to solve/cure the problem. The learned experts take cognizance of the accumulated knowledge of research efforts made thus far. Further research work proceeds by following the leads of the shoots and particles of the creeper of existing research work. This is like breaking one's head on stone of ignorance and crushing the minute particles अंशु of this
medicinal creeper to find the 'juices'. New scientists sift and screen the data of earlier researches. This is likened to a sieve woven out of the grey hair of experience and used for straining the juices of the inference arrived at so far. The scientist who strains these 'Juices' and assimilates them in his intellect is obviously exhilarated at his findings, and is said to be intoxicated with his knowledge find. **

**Thus term Soma will mainly represent a knowledge, talent, capacity , quality and may also be considered to include any medicinal
stimulants by uneducated people, the herbs that provide strength and stimulate motivations which make possible innumerable constructive, beneficial tasks & actions, for welfare of the world.**

**How Soma- Physical knowledge- is created is found in Rig Veda 10.11.4 **

**अध त्यं द्रप्सं विभवं विचक्षणंÓ विरा भरिदिषित: श्येनो अध्वरे ! **

**यदी विशो वृणितेê दस्ममार्या अग्निं होतारमध धीरजायत !!**

**ऋग्वेद 10/11.4**

**द्रप्सं (साधरण दही की लस्सी) a very ordinarily met fluid like butter milk , विभवंÓ when looked in to by concentrating on its important aspects विचक्षणंÓ brings to light विराभरदिषित: as if the researcher
pulls out of fire, श्येनोê as a hawk-eyed observer taking in his notice from very high position a total perception, अध्वरेêü the hard intelligent worker.**

**यदी विशोê if ordinary common persons वृणतेê adopt such strategies of scientific enquiry, दस्मे they आर्या become virtuous, अग्निं होतरमध
by performing Yajna to get fired in to action, धी: thus Soma true knowledge in intellect, जायत is born**

**(Newton discovered the force of gravity by deep perception and observation of a very common every day event of an apple falling from a tree. This is the phenomenon Veda is saying in above Mantra.)**

**What Soma Does?**

****

What Soma Does and what is the effect of Soma on a person who has got “Drunk” on Soma is beautifully described in the thirteen mantras that constitute Rig Veda 10.119, and may indeed look extremely futuristic, even in context of present day modern world.

**13. गृहो याम्यरङ्कृतो देवेभ्यो हव्यवाहन: I कुवितसोमस्यापामिति II
ऋग्वेद 10/119/13**
