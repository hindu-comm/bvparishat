Please be courteous in using roman script for typing Sanskrit sentence.

  

My first reading of the above was,

  

dhanyabadah many a bar,

  

many a + bar = times (in hindi).

  

Even in English, Thanks is used in plural generally.

  

Only after a second thought I realized it is Sanskrit, and Sanskrit has a convenient practice of interchanging of v - b as and when one requires and Hindi practice of maintaining the convention of pronouncing of short "a" as prescribed by Panini, in the last sUtra

8-4-68 अ \> अ संवृत अ is substituted in all the cases of earlier prescriptions of अ which are विवार-s. My teacher of grammar provided this information). 

  

Thanks for the original posting and this posting of thanks also.

  

With regards
