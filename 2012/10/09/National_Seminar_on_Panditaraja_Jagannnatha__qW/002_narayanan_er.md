Respected Professor Bhat Sir,

I think this is one of the examples for the influence of local dialects dominate over one's Sanskrit learnings. I knew Sh. Kapil, who is from Madhya Pradesh, where quite a few people from many a number of villages are habituated to speak the dialect called the bundelkhaṇḍī, and using the Devanagari script, like in Hindi. When it comes the matter of pronunciation of Sanskrit passages too, the natural local dialect speech habit dominates, where Sanskrit phonetics could hardly be taught. This is what Bāṇabhaṭṭa speaks in his Kādambarī about the tongue manipulation of parrots-śukānāṃ tu jihvāparivṛttiḥ and the loss of speech of the elephants despite they have good intelligence. Seven years ago, I was about to take a class on the Abhjñānaśākuntalam to the Shastri IInd year students at Bhopal, one of the students, but it was not Kapil I remember, asked me in his habitual musical tone: gūūrūūji, pīīryaḍ lāāgéga? ēk nīīmāāntrāāṇ hē, gūūrūūji, apan jāāy? (Sir, will this period be effective? There is a nimantraṇa, Sir, shall we go?). I told him: दुष्यन्तः शकुन्तलायामनुरक्त इति श्रोतव्यमेतत्। कुत इतो गम्यते? I knew that many poor people live by this nimantraṇa, where brahmin boys are invited to have their food and dakṣiṇā of a considerable amount. Still they liked to listen to Kālidāsa's own words on Duṣyanta's passion with Śakuntalā. They write धन्यवादः and मान्यवर etc. in Devanagari, but readin the way how Sh. Kapil had posted.  

Regards,

Narayanan
