Dear Scholars,  
  
I attach herewith a list of the philosophical texts included in the Mok.sa-dharma-parvan of the Mahaabhaarata. (The print in the attachment is rather small and occasionally unclear; you may have to increase the size and read).  
  
What I would like to know is whether there are any traditional commentaries on any of the individual texts mentioned (in other words, if the situation is comparable to texts such as the Sanat-sujaattiya or Vi.s.nu-sahasra-naaman). If there are such works known to you in print or are listed in the manuscript collections or catalogues accessible to you, kindly provide details.  
  
Commentaries covering the entire MB or a large part of it, other than the well-known ones, may be listed, especially if they are written by philosophers and cover the chapters specified.  
  
Commentaries in regional languages may also be listed if they are composed by traditional scholars.  
  
The list need not be confined to Naagarii printed editions or manuscripts.  
  
Thank you.
