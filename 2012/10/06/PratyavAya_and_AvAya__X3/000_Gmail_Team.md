Dear Dr. E.R.Narayanan,



You have explained very well the meaning of "PratyavAya" . What would be the meaning of "avAya" in your opinion? Also let us know please meaning of



Abhikrama and PratyavAya as they appear in the verse from GITA.



Different books on GITA offer different meanings. So I am asking this question. Please pardon me for requesting your services. Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
