Respected Professor Joshi,  
Avāya is formed from the root 'ayă' gatau (motion) having preposed with 'ava' has the meanings of yielding, going down and understanding too. It is like avagatiḥ, avagamanam, avagamaḥ etc. it can be avāyatiḥ, avāyanam and avāyaḥ in different forms but convey the same. I cannot make an opinion in the meanings of terms, rather than following what the ancestors teach us. We have seen the minimum structure of this while I was replying to Advayananda Swamiji in a previous mail. Then what is abhikarman then? Abhi has been prefixed here. What is karman then, etymologically-an action is being performed (yat kriyate tat karma), it is from the root ḍukṛñ karaṇe (to do) with a 'man' suffix to make it karman. Abhikarma is performing about or bringing about. Here prefix 'abhi' plays the role to change the root meaning. I always felt blessed when I try to answer something, with a view to improving my skills, and also feel lucky to be a member of the Bharatiya Vidvat Parishad.  
Then regarding the interpretations of the Gita, there could be many, all those meanings could be justified, expressively, conventionally, intentionally or suggestively. We had only one Brahmasūtra. But Shankara, Bhaskara, Ramanuja, Madhva, Nimbarka, Srikantha, Sripati, Vallabha, Vijnanabhiksu and Baladeva made it into ten different schools. That is the case with the Gita too.  
Regards,  
Narayanan
