Dear Sh. Nityanand,  
Thank you very much for pointing out the mistake. I appreciate your inquisitiveness in mathematics, by which you rightly picked up the metrical imbalance. Such mistakes always, though it happens due to oversight, hurts the impression of any metrical form. Though you are an expert of modern science, technology and mathematics, I understand that you are a well trained Sanskrit grammarian too. May I request you, if find leisure, to please teach the students of younger generation, especially regarding the knowledge you have already acquired on Paninian grammar, metrical science, literature, mathematics, the versatile general knowledge and what not. I request you to write sometimes in Sanskrit too, in this BVP also, which may benefit the newcomers in the field of our great culture and tradition.  
  
Regarding correcting my verse, here it is again, and please have it:  
  
शर्परे खरि च खर्परे शरीत्येवमेव ननु शर्विसर्गते।  

संहिते हि भवतस्तदाश्रिते सूत्रवार्त्तिकविकल्पकल्पिते।।

  
  
Moreover, I knew both Devarṣi Kalānātha Śāstrī and Abhirāja Rājendra Miśra, the two great stalwarts of Sanskrit poetical literature, are capable of creating the Mahakavyas of at most beauty. Late Professor Bhaskaracharya Tripathi was also of that calibre. Nowadays, Professor Iccharam Dwivedi also writes exquisite poems.  
  
With a short span of my studies the lesson what I learned is; if one tries to practice making verses with different types of metres by following your elders, can pick up that sort of continuity in aligning words to the suit. But the ultimate charm of any poem is product of born talent followed by education and regular practice. Meanwhile, let me remember one of my singlet:  
  
काव्यालापश्रुतिरसवशादात्तबोधेन वाऽहं

ग्राहं ग्राहं कविसहचरीं वासनां सत्कवीनाम्।

नित्याभ्यासात् परिणमयितुं पद्यबन्धैरनेकै-

रुद्युक्तोऽपि स्खलितवचसा वाक्प्रयोगाद् बिभेमि।।   
  
With regards again,  
Narayanan
