Respected Dr. Narayanan  
  
As always, your spontaneous verses are mellifluous and scholarly at the same time. I also enjoyed the one on Yāska that you posted on the other thread. There is a typo (one missing syllable) in the second foot of the शर्परे खरि verse so I request you to please send it again.  
  
I am glad that you are enjoying reading Śrībhārgavarāghavīyam. The work indeed has many great प्रयोगs (usages) including some rare and new ones like द्विजाग्रभू for अग्नि (verse 17.20, Agni being the elder brother of Brahmins), करजुष्टजानु for आजानुबाहु (verse 2.49), et cetera. You may want to read the following two critiques of Śrībhārgavarāghavīyam -  

1.  Dr. Vāgīśa Dinakara (2008) (in Hindi). Śrībhārgavarāghavīyam
    Mīmāṃsā. New Delhi: Deshbharti Prakashan. ISBN 978-81-908276-6-9.
    This is a 278 page book with brilliiant and in-depth analysis and
    review of the epic. Dr. Vāgīśa Dinakara (of Pilkhuwa, Ghaziabad) is
    the son of the famous Samskrita scholar the late Ācārya Rāmanātha
    Sumana. I was gifted an autographed copy of the book by Dr. Dinakara
    himself in 2010, and have read it several times.  
2.  Devarṣi Kalānātha Śāstrī wrote a Samskrita review of the epic in the
    January 2003 issues of the journal Bhāratī, which has the photo of
    the Guru releasing a copy of the epic on the cover. I have not been
    able to procure the issue, but as you are in Jaipur, you may get in
    touch with the Bhāratī office or Devarṣi Śāstrī for the same.  

In addition there is a three page Samskrita review by Triveṇīkavi Abhirāja Rājendra Miśra in the Nandīvāk of the printed edition of Śrībhārgavarāghavīyam.  
  
Your Vidheya, Nityanand
