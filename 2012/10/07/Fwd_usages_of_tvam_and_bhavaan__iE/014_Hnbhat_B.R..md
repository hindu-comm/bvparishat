Thanks for the fine analysis.

  

I only beg to differ in certain respects.

  
In the first place,

Here we are taught that there are two words भवत् similarly ending with त्. One is pronoun listed among सर्वादिगण and used as pronoun. This is the one in question and it is not the present participle derived from भू सत्तायाम्, but derived differently as explained by the commentators: भा दीप्तौ + डवतु - 

  

सर्वादिगणे \`भवतु' इत्यव्युत्पन्नं प्रातिपदिकं पठितं, तस्य व्यपदेशिवत्त्वे उगदन्तत्वान्ङीप्। ङपावितौ। \`आच्छीनद्योर्नुम्'\`शप्श्यनोर्नित्य'मिति नुम्न, शत्रन्तत्वाऽभावात्। \`उगिदचा'मित्यपि न सर्वनामस्थानत्वाऽभावात्। अथ द्वितीयमुगितमुदाहरति-पचन्तीति। पचेर्लटः शतरि शषि पररूपे पचच्छब्दः। तत्र शतृप्रत्यय उगित्, तदन्तं पचदिति प्रातिपदिकमिति तस्मान्ङीपि \`शप्श्यनोर्नि'मिति नुमिति भावः। यदि तु सर्वादिगणे पठितं भवतु इत्येतत् \`भातेर्डवतुः'इति व्युत्पाद्यते, तदा उगित्प्रत्ययान्तस्यैवोदाहरणं बोध्यम्। भूधातोः शतरि शपि ऊकारस्य गुणेऽवादेशे भवच्छब्दान्ङीपि तु, \`शप्श्यनोर्नित्य'मिति नुमि भवन्तीति रूपम्। नच भवच्छब्दस्याऽप्युत्पन्नत्वे तस्य कथं व्यपदेशिवत्त्वेनोगिदन्तत्वं, \`व्यपदेशिवद्भावोऽप्रातिपदिकेने'ति वचनादिति वाच्यं, प्रातिपदिकस्य तत्तत्स्वरूपेण ग्रहण एव तत्प्रवृत्तेः। \`उगिदचामिति सूत्र' इत्यादिग्रन्थो हलन्ताधिकारे गोमच्छब्दनिरूपणे व्याख्यातः।

  

The above makes clear, the uniformity in the forms, but for the nominal singular, which differ:

  

The participle form, of भू will have only भवन् and the pronoun भवत् would be inflected as भवान् - as used by माघ -शिशुपालवधम्/प्रथमः सर्गः ---

  

स्मरस्यदो*दाशरथिर्भवन् भवानमुं*वनान्ताद्वनितापहारिणम् । पयोधिमाविद्धचलज्जलाविलं विलङ्घ्य लङ्कां निकषा हनिष्यति ॥ ६८ ॥

  

The force of participle and the respectful usage of the pronoun are clear in the above usage. The speaker is नरद and addressee is श्रीकृष्ण. This can be reverse also. नारद being ऋषि, respectable to श्रीकृष्ण, and could be addressed as भवान्.

  

The above example is an example for*अभिज्ञावचने लृट्*। ३. २. ११३ future sentence used to remind past event. You remember that born as the son of दशरथ, thou killed the kidnapper of your wife from the forest ranges, crossing the agitated sea with waters, nearby Lanka.

  

The above just a running translation, not intended to be literal.

  



>

Since translating > bhavaan as 'your presence' sounds awkward in English, other devices > are thought of.

> 
> > 
> > 
> > 

  

With the above example, the discussion above seems to be out of focus, considering the etymology derivation from "भा दीप्तौ" to shine, or glorious directly conveys the respectful aspect by itself, while the participle has nothing to do with this aspect beyond the scope of present participle. Beyond the etymology, सर्वं खल्विदं ब्रह्म, अनादिनिधनं ब्रह्म शब्दतत्त्वं यदक्षरम्। is the over all pervasive तत्त्व येन सर्वमिदं विभाति, etc. can be applied to any words. "सर्वे सर्वार्थवाचकाः" applies for योगिन्-s who can realize even beyond the words, anything.

The practices and grammatical patterns of each language, have their own distinct features which could not be translated literally and it is though compared for comparison sake, could not be transferred to another language.

This aspect is highlighted from the quotation from Magha in the case of Krishna and it lies in the view of point of the speaker and has nothing to do with grammar.

Here, it is a different case. The two sentences are not similar.

  

The first is the vocative of भवती in the feminine gender, though pronouns do not carry vocatives generally. हे भवति, \[त्वं\] भिक्षां देहि is the correct structure and देहि is not related with the pronoun भवत्. In the second, it is a simple imperative sentence, in which the pronoun भवत् is the agent of the action of दा. Hence the difference. It may be though as the common practice to beg alms from house mistress, than from the householder in the Indian context. Hence the above line is the great "mantra" of the mendicants "भवति भिक्षां देहि"

  

This was discussed in another group and here is the link:

  

<https://groups.google.com/d/topic/samskrita/iZsRvGDNEkI/discussion>

  

Here is an blog on the phrase "भवति भिक्षां देहि" quoting Manu changing the word order, in respect of people whom the mendicant is asking for भिक्षा

  

<http://likhoyahanvahan.blogspot.in/2009/11/blog-post_25.html>

  

  

The two common phrases in dramatic language, तत्रभवान् तत्रभवती are used in addition to those listed in my previous post.
