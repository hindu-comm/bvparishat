bhavat is the prAtipadika of the nominative singular bhavaan. bhavat is formed by attaching the present-continuous affix - Satri (शतृ) - to the root bhoo (sattaayaam). Thus, the etymological meaning is 'being' which can be more coherently thought of as 'presence'. Whose presence? Your presence. Clearly, the 'your' part is adhyaahritam - to be supplied by the listener. Since translating bhavaan as 'your presence' sounds awkward in English, other devices are thought of. It is easy to see why it has been settled that it denotes respect, by noting the following practices in the world.



\- passive voice is considered more polite/respectful than active voice: itlessens the scope for hurt in a tense conversation.

\- it is often seen that persons of authority issue orders couched as requests. Indeed, it is seen as a mark of culture and sophistication, when an order is couched as a request: as in asking a waiter "could we have some water, please?". It is significant that Vedic injunctions are in liÑ and not loT.  
- it is considered disrespectful to look a person of authority in the eye and speak.

\- extending this, it is more respectful to speak in third person than in second person - as in, "as desired by the king""



Based on the above, we canwhy the two views have evolved



\- भवान् and त्वं are not equivalent, and when used in the You (singular) sense, त्वं is better

\- भवान् is used to say "Respectable You" or "Honourable You" while त्वं indicates informality/peer relationship



Generally speaking, one is supposed to do as great people say, not as great people act (for instance Krishna can take 16,008 wives but an ordinary person should not try to imitate that). Rishis and Kavis are great people and take liberties with language that an ordinary person should not normally imitate. So, teachers teach safe practices - and when the student matures as a scholar, knowingly or unknowingly he or she would use language in some unique ways.



Incidentally, regarding asking for alms: there are two expressions in general use, not only one as mentioned. भवति! भिक्षां देहि\| and भवान् भिक्षां ददातु\|
