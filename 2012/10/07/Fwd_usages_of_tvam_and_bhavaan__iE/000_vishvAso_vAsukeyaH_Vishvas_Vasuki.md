नमो नमः पण्डितवर्येभ्यः।

  

आनन्दवर्येण मम मित्रेणपुराप्रेशितस्य सन्देशस्य कश्चनभागं युष्मभ्यं ददर्शयिषामि (\<-- साधुत्वसन्देहः)। अत्र युष्माकं चिन्तनं किम्? (आदरप्रकटनाय बहुवचनप्रयोगः ज्ञातः एव।)

  

---------- Forwarded message ----------  

  

There are two opinions in Sanskrit usage that are prevalent among some people:

\- भवान् and त्वं are not equivalent, and when used in the You (singular) sense, त्वं is better

\- भवान् is used to say "Respectable You" or "Honourable You" while त्वं indicates informality/peer relationship

  

There is sufficient evidence in the literature that these two opinions may not be appropriate.

  

Some examples:

0\. There are many quotations from the Vedas like "तत् त्वं असि", "त्वमेव प्रत्यक्षं ब्रह्मासि" etc. where the Brahman is respectfully called with त्वं

  

1\. [Bhagavad Gita 1.3](http://vedabase.net/bg/1/3/)- Duryodhana starts addressing Dronacharya with "आचार्य! एतां महतीं चमूं (त्वं) पश्य"

and then in [Bhagavad Gita 1.8](http://vedabase.net/bg/1/8/en)with "भवान् भीष्मश्च ...". There is no evident change in tone in that soliloquoy of Duryodhana.

  

There are many examples of त्वं and भवान् used in the same verse with no change in tone:

2.[Shrimad Bhagavata 10.59.29](http://vedabase.net/sb/10/59/29/en1)- After Krishna killed Bhaumasura, Goddess Bhumi talks to Krishna in a set of verses from 10.59.24 to 10.59.31In one of them, she uses त्वं and भवान् in the same sentence with utmost reverance.

3\. [Bhagavad Gita 10.12-13](http://vedabase.net/bg/10/13/en1)- In the 10th adhyaaya, Arjuna starts extolling Krishna. In this verse, he says ".. पवित्रं परमं भवान् ... आहुस् त्वं ऋषयः सर्वे .." and uses त्वं and भवान् respectfully to address Him.

4.[Shrimad Bhagavata 1.14.42](http://vedabase.net/sb/1/14/42/)- Yuddhistra asks Arjuna of his well-being on returning from Dwaraka. त्वं and भवान् are used equivalently.

5\. [Shri Vishnu Purana](http://archive.org/details/SriSriVishnuPurana) 1.9.69 (.70 in some versions) - "स त्वं एव जगत्-स्रष्टा यतः सर्वगतो भवान्"

6.[Shrimad Ramayana 6.117.23](http://sanskritdocuments.org/sites/valmikiramayan/yuddha/sarga117/yuddha_117_frame.htm)- "भवान् नारायणो देवः .. एकशृङ्गो वराहः त्वं ..."

Brahma extols Rama and says that even though Rama thinks he is just a man, he is actually the Supreme Lord. He uses very reverentially both the words भवान् and त्वं in the same verse.

  

The above examples show the usages of त्वं and भवान् equivalently but do not show verbal usages corresponding to both in the same sentence. Here is an example which does:

7\. [Shrimad Ramayana 2.106.31-32](http://www.valmikiramayan.net/ayodhya/sarga106/ayodhyaitrans106.htm)- Bharata first says "Please show compassion in me" with "शिरसा त्वा अभियाचे अहं कुरुष्व करुणां मयि .." and then says "अथ वा पृष्टतः कृत्वा वनं एव भवान् इतः गमिष्यति गमिष्यामि भवता सार्धं अपि अहं" - using not just the descriptive words भवान् and त्वं but also verbal forms relevant to both with गमिष्यति and कुरुष्व respectively.

  

Here is an example from Kalidasa's work:

8\. In Abhigyaana Shaakuntalam, the court jester (विदूषकः) speaks in Prakrit and in most places, refers to the King Dushyanta as भवान् while the King calls the jester with त्वं. In [2.11](http://www.scribd.com/doc/6591907/Sakuntalam-Sanskrit-Text-English-Translation)(Page 65) though, he says to the King "कुतः किल स्वयं अक्षिणी आकुलीकृत्य अश्रु-कारणं प्रच्छसि?"

  

And then there is the phrase that is used by mendicants for ages:

9\. "(हे) भवति (त्वं) भिक्षां देहि" which mixes the two forms even when a beggar is obviously showing respect. It is understandable that since त्वं does not have a संबोधन (invocative) form, we are forced to use the संबोधन form of भवती, but if त्वं was not prescribed in a respectful context, beggars would be more successful with "भवति भिक्षां ददातु"

  

10\. There are plenty of salutary poems by poets right up to 15th century ([Shri Venkatesha Suprabhatam](http://www.brainsnacks.info/sanskrit/Venkatesa-Suprabhatam/index.html) by Shri Prativadi Bhayankara Annangaracharya) where the Lord is referred to as त्वं, whether the poet is scolding the Lord for not coming earlier to save/protect him, or for extolling His amazing virtues. It is hard to believe that songs like the [Navagraha Kritis of Swati Tirunal](http://carnatica.net/special/navaratrikritis.htm)on the Goddess would not have pourings of respect, and yet all nine of those use the 2nd person (त्वं) पाहि मां in them.

  

It is unclear why linguists like Shri A.A.Macdonell ([Page 292 of Vedic Grammar](http://books.google.com/books?id=vo_N2tSdfQsC&pg=PA292&lpg=PA292&dq=tvam+bhavaan+usage&source=bl&ots=KykhmFYPXu&sig=uuDZJlvC1Y_Z3np7xqwdJiDwNHA&hl=en&sa=X&ei=umoUULimJorCrQHf44HICw&ved=0CEwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=tvam%20bhavaan%20usage&f=false)) consider bhavaan as "Honorable You". One line of reasoning is that since many indian languages have a term for "You" and "Respectable You", they would like to attribute this characteristic to Sanskrit. I am not able to find any note in the grammatical texts like Mahabhashyaon the difference in their usage.
