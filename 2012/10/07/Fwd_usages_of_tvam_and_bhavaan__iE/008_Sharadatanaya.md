अत्र तु पुनः सन्देहः - यद्यपि वयं  
प्राचीनकालं गत्वा संभाषणानि श्रोतुं न शक्नुमः (कालप्रयाणशक्तेरभावात्)

Ever heard a name Sri Sri Charudeva Sastry? I suggest you to read his  
Vaagvyavahaaradarsa (there is two edition one is completely in hindi  
and another is sanskrit, you please refer sanskrit) also refer  
Sabdapasabdaviveka , Vakyamuktavali and Gandhicharita, try to read K L  
V Sastry's Sanskrit reader and dramas
