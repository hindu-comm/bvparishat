Respected Professor Joshi,  
I am simply a student of Sanskrit, and nothing more than that. Luckily, we have a platform for conversation in the form of this forum, and many versatile scholars correct me when I commit mistakes. I am not a storehouse of anything, Sir, but our electronic media is well a storehouse. We have many lexicons and grammar texts online as well as off-line through which we can check what we use. I am sorry for giving the etymology of a different term, due to oversight.  
Now, we see "abhikrama". Abhi is the prefix. kramu pādavikṣepe (stepping foot) is the root in Atmanepada, forms the verb kramate (one steps his/her feet). Viṣṇu incarnated for putting his three special steps and became Trivikrama (one having three special steps). The Vedic hymn: इदं विष्णुर्विचक्रमे त्रेधा निदधे पदम्। समूढमस्य पाँसुरे। त्रीणि पदा विचक्रमे विष्णुर्गोपा अदाभ्यः। Back to the term: abhikrama again. The combination is of the prefix abhi followed by the root part kram and having the suffix ghañ followed by the nominal suffix s which ultimately appears to be ḥ. Here ghañ is a ñ ending primary derivative suffix. Due to its ñ ending it can make into abhikrāma instead of abhikrama. But it is not happening here. The lengthening of a into ā is denied by the rule 7.3.34, due to that the root is listed under the sounding of udātta. Abhikramyate karmaṇā prārabhyate ity abhikramaḥ karmārabdhaphalam (result of an enterprize), prārambhaḥ (beginning), ārohaṇam (climbing), abhītayodhāder śatrusammukhagamanam (brave varlours come in front of the enemies). Abhi, the prefix makes the changes to the root meaning here.  
According to M. M. Williams: abhikrama means: approaching, undertaking, assault, beginning, attempt, attack, effort, ascending, stepping near and overpowering.  
Regards,
