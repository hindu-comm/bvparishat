Very encouraging and long-awaited marvellous news for all sanskritists and like-minded persons. The module no.7 (mathematics) and no 6 ( Ayurveda etc ) are very useful for students and it will be great, if some selected and short portions of concerned texts be included in the sanskrit textbooks at 7th & 8th standards.
