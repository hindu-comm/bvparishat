Respected Professor Bhattacharya Sir,

Thanks a lot for the explanation and it suits to what I thought, as our ancient sages can hardly be wrong in any interpretation. The Jainadharmamrta or the Angara (Chapter 4, Verse.62) of Ashadhara say: यद्व्यद्घुं घुणवद् वज्रमीष्टे न विषयव्रजः। मुनीनामपि दुष्प्रापं तन्मनस्तत्तमुत्सृज।। ४-६२।। and somebody also say: मुनीनामपि मतिभ्रमः etc. are limited to the rhetoric exaggeration only. If the usage of tumunnanta, then puruṣān attum could be justified, here we realize that puruṣān adanāya is used by Yaska in the sense of puruṣān attum or puruṣāṇām adanāya. Śaunaka might have been happy if Yaska would have derived it as: puruṣādo narabhojī in an undivided way, with change of terms, as the complaint of Śaunaka is on the division of a compound term. Yes, Sir, it should be पुरुषादःपदं together instead of पुरुषादः पदं, otherwise, Yaska will become a पुरुषादः as an attribute which Śaunaka might have hardly thought of.

Regards,

Narayanan
