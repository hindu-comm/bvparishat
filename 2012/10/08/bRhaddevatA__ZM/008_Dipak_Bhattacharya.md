Dear Colleagues,

It is not clear to me why it has been maintained that Yāska was wrong in his interpretation of

पदमेकं समादाय द्विधा कृत्वा निरुक्तवान्।

पुरुषादः पदं यास्को वृक्षे वृक्ष इति त्वृचि।।१११।।

He had to clarify the meaning of *puruṣ**ādaḥ *in the verse. Literally it means man-eating. Yāska states the meaning in clear terms *puruṣān adanāya*. The Sanskrit is wrong but the import is clear ‘to kill puruṣas’. For correct Sanskrit Yāska could have told *puruṣāṇām adanāya*. Yāska wrongly employs *kdyogadvitīya* where *ṣaṣṭhī* was expected. Otherwise he is not wrong in explaining the meaning.

It seems that Śaunaka implies that for a single word a single word should have been used. But in our commentarial literature no such rule exists. It is expected that one should make the meaning clear. But there is no rule as to whether for a every word that will be accomplished through a sentence or a single word. So one should not find fault with Yāska here.

Best
