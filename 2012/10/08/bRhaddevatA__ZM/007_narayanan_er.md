Thank you very much, Sir, for those two pages. I am not an expert in reading Kannada script, still may I repeat:  

ಪದಮೇಕಂ ಸಮಾದಾಯ ದ್ವಿಧಾ ಕೃತ್ವಾ ನಿರುಕ್ತವಾನ್.

ಪುರುಷಾದಃ ಪದಂ ಯಾಸ್ಕೋ ವೃಕ್ಷೇ ವೃಕ್ಷ ಇತಿ ತ್ವೃಚಿ. ೧೧೧.

पदमेकं समादाय द्विधा कृत्वा निरुक्तवान्।

पुरुषादः पदं यास्को वृक्षे वृक्ष इति त्वृचि।।१११।।

The English note given: Yaska has in the stanza "to every tree" explained the word "man eating" by taking one word (and) dividing (it) into two. (This English note is not satisfactory)  

ಅನೇಕಂ ಸತ್ತಥಾ ತಾನ್ಯದೇಕಮೇವ ನಿರುಕ್ತವಾನ್.

ಅರುಣೋ ಮಾ ಸಕೃನ್ಮನ್ತ್ರೇ ಮಾಸಕೃದ್ವಿಗ್ರಹೇಣ ತು. ೧೧೨.

अनेकं सत्तथा चान्यदेकमेव निरुक्तवान्।

अरुणो मा सकृन्मन्त्रे मासकृद्विग्रहेण तु।।११२।।

The English note given: Similarly, another (expression) which is not one (word) he has explained as one only by (his) analysis as month-maker in the formula "the ruddy one me once".

  

In both cases, it is right that Shaunaka differs with Yaska and there could be more examples too. Here the question is: when the sentences in accented form convey the meanings, there could not be any harm while you divide any word to explore the individual meanings, whereas in the mantras the accented unit in the form of the sentence convey the meaning. When the words convey their meanings individually, those Yaska etymologies do not harm, but those ingredients of words work together to have the coordinated unit as the sentence the role will be one aim of each ingredients to have a sentence meaning or the mantra meaning like: अग्निमीऴे पुरोहितम् etc. From a grammarian point of view, the division into the ingredients is no harm. Whether any word is derived, and its syntactical elements are dismantled to expose its etymological structure, its up to that word only. But when that word becomes a team member of any mantra specifically accented it is only one of the members of the sentence for the conveyance of the whole mantra meaning.   

Regards,

Narayanan
