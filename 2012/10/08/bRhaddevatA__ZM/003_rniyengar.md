Dear Dr.Narayanan,  
Your note about BD is informative,crisp and precise. The Mysore Palace  
brought out RV and related texts in 36 volumes c 1955. Vol.28 contains  
BD consisting of 1208 verses. They have not mentioned from where they  
took the text. Perhaps it is the longer version which you have  
mentioned. There seems to be 60 legends; at least that is what is  
listed. There may be more. The text is in Kannada script with Kannada  
and English translation, which I find wanting in many places.  
  
BD is extremely important to appreciate Vedic tradition (from my  
personal point of view) as it highlights the mistakes of Yaska; or at  
least S'aunaka's different interpretations.  
About the legends you write some are "...historically connected to the  
Mahābhārata". Could you please elaborate on this.  
  
Kind regards  
  
RN Iyengar
