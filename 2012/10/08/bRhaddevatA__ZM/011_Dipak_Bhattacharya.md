11.10.12

Thank you dear Narayanan! I admire your accuracy and desire to penetrate into the minds of the Śāstrakāras. But please read पूरुषादःपदं with a long पू which is Śaunaka’s (BD 2.111) reading. RV 10.27.22 has पूरु॒षादः॑। The long ū is metrical (the end of triṣṭubh is \_˅\_*˅*). In my edition Yāska (N. 2.6) has पुरुषानदनाय। He could, of course, avoid the metrical lengthening in deference to grammar. But I have no good edition with me to verify his actual reading. There would have been nothing wrong if he kept the svādhyāya reading.

Best
