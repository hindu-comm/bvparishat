Respected Scholars,

One research scholar working for Ph.D under the guidance of Professor N. K. Sundareswaran of the University of Calicut wants to know about whether any research or studies had been done on the Bṛhaddevatā-as a prominent source for Sāyaṇa’s commentary on the Ṛgveda.  

Here I would like to share a bit whatever I come across through the internet. The Bṛhaddevatā is a metrical Sanskrit work, traditionally ascribed to Śaunaka. It is an enlarged catalogue of the Ṛgvedic deities worshipped in the individual sūktas (hymns) of the Ṛgveda. It also contains the myths and legends related to the composition of these suktas.The extant manuscripts of this text are found in two recensions, the shorter and the longer. The shorter recension contains 1091 verses, of which 18 verses are not found in the longer one. Similarly, the longer recension has 1206 verses, of which 133 verses are not found in the shorter recension. The first printed edition of this text was edited by Rajendralala Mitra. It was published by the Asiatic Society, Calcutta as a part of their Bibliotheca Indica series in 1892. According to A. A. Macdonell, this edition had a large number of misprints. It also consisted many impossible readings taken from incorrect manuscripts, omissions of lines, repetitions of lines and insertions of undoubtedly spurious lines. It was based on seven manuscripts. A. A. Macdonell produced a critical edition with an exhaustive introduction in English, seven appendices and a translation into English in two parts, published in 1904. This edition is based on nine manuscripts, as well as Rajendralala Mitra's edition. A new critical edition, by Muneo Tokunaga, of the text was published in 1997. The work consists eight adhyāyas (chapters), mostly written in Anuṣṭubh meter, though a number of verses are in Triṣṭubh meter also. Each adhyāya comprises about 30 vargas, each consisting of five verses. The text begins with a long introduction embracing the complete first adhyaya, and twenty-five vargas of the second. The main body of the text beginning from the twenty-sixth varga of the second adhyāya, for the most part, is concerned with stating the deities, in their successive order, for the hymns and stanzas of the Ṛgveda. It also comprises nearly forty legends, described to explain the circumstances under which the hymns they are concerned with were composed. These legends cover almost a quarter of the whole text. A number of these legends are historically connected to the Mahābhārata.

The bibliographic information: Śaunakīya Bṛhaddevatā: volume 164 of Kāśī Saṃskr̥ta granthamālā, Editor: Rāmakumāra Rāya, Publisher: Chaukhambha Sanskrit Series Office, Varanasi, 1963.  

So, I request the honourable scholars having versatile reading of this forum to help him if possible at their leisure through this forum. He is curious to know that whether anybody have worked on this topic earlier.

Regards,

Narayanan
