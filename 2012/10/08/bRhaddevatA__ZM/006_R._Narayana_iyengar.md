Dear Dr.Narayanan, Namaste,  
  
You asked "Is it possible, Sir, that Shaunaka,Yaska etc. commit mistakes? As the meanings always follow what the sages preach!!" You are far better qualified to answer this question than me. I only like to quote S'aunaka-BD Ch2.111-112  
पदमेकं समादाय द्विधाक्र्त्वा निरुक्तवान् \| पुरूषाद:पदंयास्को वृक्षेवृक्ष इति त्वृचि \|\|  
अनेकं सत्तथा चान्यदेकमेव निरुक्तवान् \| अरुणो मा सकृन्मन्त्रे मासकृद्विग्रहेणतु\|\|  
I am attaching two pages from Mysore Palace Edition which was brought out by a group of 10-12 traditional learned Vedic scholars of great repute. They have titled the subsection 23 in both Kannada and English clearly as Yaska's wrong explanation.  
Please advise me how to interpret this further.  
  
with kind regards  
  
RN Iyengar
