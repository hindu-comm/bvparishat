Respected Professor Joshi,  
It is from the Raghuvamsamahakavya of Kalidasa (1:15)  
आकारसदृशः प्रज्ञः प्रज्ञया सदृशागमः।  
आगमैः सदृशारम्भ आरम्भसदृशोदयः।।१५।।  
My English (sorry for poor grammar or idiom if any) translation: One has the intelligence resembles to his body figure, who is well learned of the Sastras to the best of the capacity of his intelligence, and his activities are equal to that of the learned one, and who has the yield of the result of such types of activities.  
  
He was Dilipa, of the Iksvaku Dynasty, having wide chest, broad shoulders like that of a bull, who was tall like a tree, had long arms as well, a strongly bulit heavy man whose body is personified like for the royal duties.  
Here Aarambha/Praarambha=activity.

Regards,

Narayanan
