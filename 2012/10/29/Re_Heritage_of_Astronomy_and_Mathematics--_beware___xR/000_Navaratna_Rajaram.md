 There is nothing new in it. It is a rehash of old discredited ideas including the Aryan invasion.

  
 I (N.S. Rajaram) reviewed Plofker for the *WEEK* and pointed out many distortions and falsifications in it. Plofker is a student of the late David Pingree whose agenda was to deny Indian contributions by attributing them to outside (often non-existent) sources.



 To take just one example, she claims Indians learnt the zero and the number system from Chinese pilgrims!



 Plofker has carried through Pingree's agenda. I pointed this out to David Mumford. Note that Plofker also introduces the discredited Aryan Invasion Theory through the backdoor, by calling it 'new historiography'.



 Plofker is a nobody and currently looking for a job. She was recently in India and treated worshipfully by her Indian followers. We should look at people's work more critically and not accept everything coming from the West as authentic.
