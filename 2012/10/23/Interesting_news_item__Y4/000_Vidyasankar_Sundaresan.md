vidvajjanebhyo namaH,



I usually try not to read too much into news items and opinion pieces, but thought the following link would be interesting to all of us here. It provides food for thought towards the end of the Navaratri festival. I have often wondered myself whether India's civilizational status will improve only if we bring back the Goddess Saraswati center stage.

Best regards,
