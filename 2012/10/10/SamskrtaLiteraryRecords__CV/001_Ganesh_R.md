Arya jagannaatha vandE bhavantaM,  
  
I had read in the editor's introduction to tirumalaaMbaa's  
varadaaMbikaa-pariNaya-campU that this kaavya has the single longest  
prose line in the whole range of world literature. Here is the  
description of river Tungabhadraa, if my memory is correct:-)  
I had also read that such feats were very much in 18th and19th  
century English literature. The reality is still, perhaps not  
verified. In most such cases the so called first (or biggest or  
longest or smallest) is on a very shaky ground:-) Any way, I do know  
that you are not for such mere quantified achievements and thanks a  
lot for the information.  
  
regards  
  
ganesh
