Dear Shrivathsa,  
  
Regarding sheldon Pollock's observations, my self and Raghavendra  
Hebbalalu hada serious discussion. There I had showed his (Pollock's)  
plus and minus points clearly.  
Ay way, irrespective of any body's hues and cries, as you say, me too  
is of the singular opinion that we bhaarateeya-s must and should learn  
SamskRtaM and realize the transcendental culture that it contains.  
  
  
regards  
  
ganesh
