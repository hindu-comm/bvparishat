Here is the brief overview of whatPollock thinks of samskritam. His opinion is thatsamskritam was a'colonising' languagesimiliar to that of english today.The implication being that English is a better successor of Sanskrit. He thinks that samskritam was in the past andis of not really much use today. Of course,samskritam can and should be studied just likeone studies anartifact in a museum (so job security for folks like himself).



An indologist thinks of himself as a scientist in a white-coat, carefully studing a 'sanskrit' lab rat.

Also to most Indologists the ''traditional samskritam scholar" is a
"native informant" (yes this is the term used in academic papers)
whocan provide information, on which a grand scientific theory/model can be built byindologicalacademics in europeor usa.

So whilea traditional-samskritam-scholarmay have a high opinion of himself, the visiting indologist onlyconsiders

the samskritam-scholar as small time information source.
