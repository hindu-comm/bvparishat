hariH OM,  
shrii rAmAnujan,  
  
 in the ihg site i was looking at phulladeepa. You have put up sAma characters as they are supposed to appear (with numbers atop them). Will you please tell me what tool was used to do this? Is the tool available for download anywhere? I will be very grateful if you can share the same.  
  
 Is such a facility available in all languages or devanAgari alone?  
  
svasti,  
 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,  

shrivathsa.
