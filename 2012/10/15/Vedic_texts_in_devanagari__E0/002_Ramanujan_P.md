Vedic Svara markers are available in other scripts also using the transliterate button at the bottom of the page.

First select any script other than Devanagari (default) and click ‘transliterate’. You would get the page rendered in the selected script.



We have developed a Vedic Editor that is used to type these. We are putting the editor for free download soon.
