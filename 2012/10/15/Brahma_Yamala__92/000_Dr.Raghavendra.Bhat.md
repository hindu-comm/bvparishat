Namaami..

Respected Sir

I am very much thank full to you for providing me details about "Brahmayaamala Tantra" through the BVParishad.

Indetail ofthat manuscript the time hasmentionedin colophon as"samvat a cū 2(172)".I am having doubt in here about**a cū 2(172).**

Is this the time ofcopying of MSS or time the present text?and what is/may be the time of the MSS?

here i am not yet came to any conclusion.It is my humblerequest that pl help on this matter.

                              

                          Thanking You
