Respected scholars,  
  
500 years of Tantrasangraha: A landmark in the history of astronomy by K Ramasubramanian & M.S.Sriram, Sources and Studies in the History of Mathematics and Physical Sciences-Tantrasangraha of Nilakatha Somayaji by K Ramasubramanian & M.S.Sriram, Mathematics in India by Kim Plofker, and the book review by D. Mumford are all interesting works to go through. I thank Sh. Nityanand and Sh.Subrahmanian for sending appropriate links. From all these books we see that to create these books those authors were increasingly dependents on Professor K. V. Sarma's valuables write-ups in different times. I repeat my friend and former colleague Dr. Sundareswaran's words: "In fact anybody working on Kerala school of Mathematics and Astronomy cannot proceed without mentioning the name of Prof. Sarma, one of the pioneers in the field."  
Regards,  
Narayanan
