Respected Professor Iyengar,

I feel that it might be right to say that many members in the BVP of the younger generation, including me are benefited by your worthwhile contributions. Not many people even in the field of Sanskrit have had the direct acquaintance and interaction with the profound scholars like Professor K.V. Sarma. That version of the Hoshiarpur journal is increasingly being dominated with Professor K.V. Sarma's theses. As an average student of Sanskrit rhetorics and aesthetics, when we talk about rāhu and ketu, I remember a verse:

चक्राभिघातप्रसभाज्ञयैव चकार यो राहुवधूजनस्य। आलिङ्गनोद्दामविलासवन्ध्यं रतोत्सवं चुम्बनमात्रशेषम्।। on which Paryāyokta, Svabhavokti, Drshtanta and Paryayavakrima are being discussed. Ketu itself is being the abdomen and rāhu being the head only, again rāhos sirah is used, as rāhu's wife is being deprived from an embrace which reduced to the kiss; as it indicates Lord Visnu's easy effort of a disc trick!!! Horoscopes indicates that rāhu and ketu looks each other as they are on seventh place from one to other.

The other Mudrarakshasa verse is: क्रूरग्रहः सकेतुश्चन्द्रमसम्पूर्णमण्डलमिदानीम्। अभिभवितुमिच्छति बलाद्रक्षेत्येनं तु बुधयोगः॥ Here सकेतुः is attributing क्रूरग्रहः and बुधयोगः might be an obstruction for a lunar eclipse. क्रूरग्रहः is not a ketu but a saketu (one who is with ketu, i.e. Rahu the head himself). But Dhundiraja can never be wrong. Here we need the help of etymology, grammar, logic, quibble/pun to derive an intended slesha. Maurya still has to expand his regime, with help of Kautilya, where Raksasa and his Nandas should loose.  

I was reading Albaruni's India an hour before, I was remembering about your previous BVP mails, on Dhruva , Sisumara etc. incidentally, another astronomer/mathematician friend Dr. N.K. Sundareswaran, my former colleague telephoned me. Moreover, Sir, acquaintance with the scholars like you is always been an asset, as I wish many a number of things to learn. Here I see no regret in following grammar, logic, astronomy, rhetorics, aesthetics and Vedanta, what ever a bit of knowledge I achieve through this BVP, where the communication of Indian knowledge is being made easy through the electronic mail system. I will read your reply again and again, because it will take a lot of time to read in between from such a scholarly comment. Thank you, Sir.  

Regards,

Narayanan
