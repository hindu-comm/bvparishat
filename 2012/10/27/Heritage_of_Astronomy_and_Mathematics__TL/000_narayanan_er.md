Heritage of Astronomy and Mathematics

  

Respected scholars,

I just tried to understand the themes of following two theseses:

1\. A History of the Kerala School of Hindu Astronomy by K.V. Sarma, V.I.Series-55, Hoshiarpur Vishveshvaranand Institute, 1972.

2\. The Contribution of Keḷallūr Nīlakaṇṭha Somayājī to Astronomy by N. K. Sundareswaran, Calicut University Sanskrit Series No. 34, 2009.

The first theses is dealing with the following:

The 'parahita' and the 'dṛk' systems of Astronomy, 'veṇvāroha' of the moon, mathematics, muhūrta, praśna etc. Along with the contributions of various astronomers lived in different centuries.

The second theses deals with the commentaries and the independent works of Keḷallūr Nīlakaṇṭha Somayājī on Astronomy. They are: Āryabhaṭīyabhāṣya, Tantrasaṅgraha, Jyotirmīmāṃsā, Siddhāntadarpaṇa, Golasāra, Candrachāyāgaṇita, Grahaṇanirṇaya and Sundararājapraśnottara. He also mentions about the other authors and their works in detail. Dr. Sundareswaran, a graduate in modern mathematics too, works out many theorems arithmetic progression, geometrical proof of algebraic results, the ratio of circumference of a circle to its diameter, which happens to be the “ π ”, is irrational, algebraic identities, pythogoras theorem, periodical divisions of astronomical parameters, the sum of the first “n” triangular numbers etc. with the quotations from the works of Keḷallūr and others.

Interestingly, Dr. Sundareswaran does not mention about the first theses (A History of the Kerala School of Hindu Astronomy by K.V. Sarma), but he lists out another work titled “The Direct Lines of Astronomical Tradition in Kerala” of K. V. Sarma, Cahrudeva Shastri Felicitation Volume, Delhi, 1972.

Professor K. V. Sarma's A History of the Kerala School of Hindu Astronomy explores about the whole mathematical and astronomical tradition of India with special efforts from the Kerala scholars. He lists out 752 Kerala works in this regard and out of which 402 pertain to astronomy and 350 to astrology. Among these 752 there are 34 works on the eclipses only. Regarding mathematics, the modern anticipations like Newto-Guass Interpolation Formula, Taylor's Sine Cosine functions, Newton's power series, Lhiuler's formula, Gregory and Libnitz's Series, long range almanacs etc. are the area of comparison with the Indian and the Western systems.

Among our BVP members, Sh. Nityanand Misra (mathematician, Sanskrit grammarian, painting-artist, multiscribe, poet, meterologist, sportsman and versatile scholar), Professor R. N. Iyengar (Astronomer, mathematician and Sanskritist), Dr. Sundareswaran (Vedic scholar, mathematician and rheterician) etc. are far more competent than I am to discuss this topic in detail.
