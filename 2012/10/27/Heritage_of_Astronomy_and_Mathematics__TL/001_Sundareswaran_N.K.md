Dear Scholars,

Pranams

Sri Dr. E. R. Narayanan is a young scholar who intervenes and interacts meaningfully in the scholarly deliberations - whatever be the branch of knowledge system. His profound scholarship and enthusiasm to widen the horizons of knowledge is to be appreciated by all.

    Since his present posting discusses about my thesis, I am to state some facts.

Prof. K. V. Sarma is a doyen of Kerala Mathematics and Astronomy.

He has unearthed, identified and edited many Kerala works on Mathematics and Astronomy.

Sri Narayanan is right in saying that his work, *A History of Kerala School of Hindu Astronomy* is a commendable work on the history of Kerala school of Astronomy.

In fact anybody working on Kerala school of Mathematics and Astronomy can proceed without mentioning the name of Prof. Sarma, one of the pioneers in the field.

  

But Sri Narayanan's statement that I have not mentioned Prof. Sarma's work,*A History of Kerala School of Hindu Astronomy* **Interestingly, Dr. Sundareswaran does not mention about the first theses (A History of the Kerala School of Hindu Astronomy by K.V. Sarma), but he lists out another work titled “The Direct Lines of Astronomical Tradition in Kerala” of K. V. Sarma, Cahrudeva Shastri Felicitation Volume, Delhi, 1972.

doesnot agree with the facts.

I have referred to all of Prof. Sarma's works with due respect. In fact I had to depend on him heavily as many of the works pf Kelallur Nilakantha Somayajin (whose works were my subject of study) were edited by Prof. Sarma.

In order to set things right, here under I am giving pertinent excerpts from my thesis.

  

  

1\) K. V. Sarma's AKHSHA contains not only a chronological survey of works and authors but a brief sketch of salient features of the school also. The chapter Modern anticipations deserves special attention. In the 1940-s K. Mukunda Marar, A. Venkataraman, T. V. Vedamurthi Aiyar and K. Balagangadharan worked in the direction shown by C. M. Whish under the pioneership of C. T. Rajagopal.

T. S. Kuppanna Sastri and K. V. Sarma through their critical edition of many important works have made a valuable contribution to the study of Kerala astronomy. In this connection the contributions made by T. A. Sarasvathi and R. C. Gupta are also worth-noticing.

( The Contribution of Kelallur Nilakantha Somayaji to astronomy, p. 18)

  

  

2\) For a long time scholars were of opinion that the work Tantrasa´graha as edited in TSS is incomplete and contains more verses.32 *K. V. Sarma has established that Tantrasa´graha contains only 432 verses in eight chapters.* In support of this, he cites the following colophonic statement appearing in the manuscript No. C. 224-C of Kerala University Oriental Research Institute and Manuscripts Library: 'iti tantrasa´grahe aÀ¶amo'dhyayaÅ/ tantrasa´grahaÅ sam¡ptaÅ/ adhy¡yam e¶¶ilum k£¶i ¿loka´´al n¡n£¶¶i muppattira¸¶u/'

( Thus (ends) the eighth chapter in the Tantrasa´graha. Here ends Tantrasa´graha. There are 432 verses contained in eight chapters ). Moreover he points out that the misconception was due to the non-distinction of some verses of Yuktid¢pik¡ and Tantrasa´graha made in the transcript, based on which the first part of Yuktibh¡À¡ has been edited by R¡mavarma Maruthampuran and A. R. Akhileswara Iyer. (p.28)

  

3)Another edition of Tantrasa´graha along with a metrical commentary Yuktid¢pik¡ (by the same commentator as above) has come from Hoshiarpur. All other works have been edited critically by K. V. Sarma through VVBIS & IS, Hoshiarpur.(p. 23)

  

4\) In the bibliography also I have included the work*A History of the Kerala School of Hindu Astronomy.* See the excerpts

  

SARMA, K. V., A History of the Kerala School of Hindu Astronomy, VIS 55, Hoshiarpur, 1972.

  

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, Observational Astronomy in India, Calicut University Series No. 5, Calicut, 1990.

  

SUBBARAYAPPA, B. V. AND SARMA, K. V., Indian Astronomy-a source book, Nehru Centre, Bombay, 1985.(p.92)

5\) Of course, I have listed the article“The Direct Lines of Astronomical Tradition in Kerala”of K. V. Sarma also ( as mentioned by Sri Narayanan) in the list of articles in journals. See below

  

SARMA. K. V., Direct lines of Astronomical Tradition in Kerala, Pt. Charudeva Shastri Felicitation volume, Delhi, 1972.

  

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, Gargya Kerala N¢laka¸¶ha Somayajin, JORM 26 (56-57), 24-39.

  

SARMA, K. V., Jyesthadeva and his identification as the author of Yuktibh¡À¡, Adayar Library Bulletin, 22 (1958), 35-40.( p.94)

  

  

Finally let me state that I am not a master of Astronomy/Mathematics (whether it be traditional or modern).

I am only an ardent student of Sanskrit.

And let me hasten to add that this posting has not got anything personal against my bosom friend Sri. Narayanan.

With pranams again,

N. K. Sundareswaran
