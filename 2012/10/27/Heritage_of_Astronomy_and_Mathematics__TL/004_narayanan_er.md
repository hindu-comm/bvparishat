Yes, Sundareswaran Sir,  
You are right. It is in page No.92 of your of your theses. I am sorry, though it was listed under a different title, for my oversight, but it was naturally invited. It exactly reads:

  
SARMA, K. V., A History of the Kerala School of Hindu Astronomy, VIS 55, Hoshiarpur, 1972.  

I found it out by re-checking. K.V. Sarma's name appears in Sanskrit list, English List and Journal List as well. Like everybody, I was naturally expecting and following the page Nos. 93-94 where the journals are listed. I expected the mentioned work in the journal list of your bibliography, because I thought Vol. X PTS i-ii March-September 1972 VISHVESHVARANAND INDOLOGICAL JOURNAL published by Dev Datta Shastri on 10-11-1972 is a journal. I still confuse between a book and a journal.  
At the same you cannot be blamed in considering that portion of K.V.Sarma articles as an English book too, it has got 96 pages of text apart from the other appendices. When I failed to find this research article listed in page No.94 of your work, I thought that either you have not referred it or the contents of both 1972 publications; i.e. the other: (The Direct Lines of Astronomical Tradition in Kerala of K. V. Sarma, Charudeva Shastri Felicitation Volume, Delhi, 1972) could be somewhat the same. Anyway, I am not seeing any problem in considering that work as English book as well as a mega research article in a journal. But that particular edition of the "journal" contains other articles too, by different authors, on Saiva worship, Vedic practice, Sanskrit verbs, literary reviews and many. Thanks a lot, Sundareswaran Sir and the other scholars of our BVP.  
Regards,  
Narayanan
