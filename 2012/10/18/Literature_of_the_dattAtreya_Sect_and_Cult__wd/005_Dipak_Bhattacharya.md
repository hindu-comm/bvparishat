Dear Colleagues,

I am very grateful to you and all the other scholars who have kindly responded to my query on the Dattaatreya Cult and Sect. I have separately sent my words of gratitude to everyone who responded, privately or to the Parishad. Here I reiterate that.

My belief that the Dattaatrya Cult is very old and perhaps older than even the Indra cult does not seem impossible to defend now. But that has to be worked out with more evidences. Before doing that I thank everybody with the assurance that if the efforts led to any publication the help shall be acknowledged.

I also take this opportunity to state that the similar help I got last year in connection with some enigmatic utterances of Kumaarila led to a publication abroad in the Proceedings of a Symposium where I acknowledged my indebtedness.

With deep gratitude  

Dipak Bhattacharya
