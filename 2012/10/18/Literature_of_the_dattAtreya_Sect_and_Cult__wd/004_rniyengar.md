The Datta cult is prevalent widely in Karnataka also. Ganagapur famous  
as Dattakshetra is in N.Karanataka. There is a cave temple known for  
Datta-paduka in Bababudangiri, Karnataka. Plenty of literature exists  
in Kannada on Dattaatreya and the sampradaya. In the 1920-50 period,  
Bet Narayan Maharaj was popular as Dattopasaka in Mysore, Bangalore  
and near by places. His Samadhi is in Bangalore. He seemed to have  
influenced the previous Maharaja of Mysore (Jayachamaraja wodeyar) who  
wrote the book "Dattatreya: The Way & The Goal, Allen & Unwin, London  
1957"  
There is a relatively modern Avadhuta Datta PeeTham in Mysore  
established by Ganapti Sacchidananda Swami. They have a long  
publication list also ([www.dattapeetham.com](http://www.dattapeetham.com))
