I appreciate the issue raised by you. One needs to be conscious of the  
different connotations and also be quite cautious in choosing terms.  
There is no need to be too sympathetic to those who are completely alien  
to the language, or to the tradition established by some scholars in the  
past (for their own purposes), and thereby feel compelled to bring out  
literal translation of every term.  
  
Being too literal doesn't make much sense, when the sense itself cannot  
be conveyed by being so -- not to speak of conveying wrong sense  
inadvertently!  
  
Best regards,  
-ram.
