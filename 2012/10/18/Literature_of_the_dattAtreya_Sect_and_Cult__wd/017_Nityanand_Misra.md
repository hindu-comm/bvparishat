Better to refer standard dictionaries like Oxford, Cambridge, American Heritage, Longfellow et cetera. Many of these have online versions. And ironically, even the thesaurus link above has this *right under the meanings* you quoted above:  
  
Notes: a **sect **is a rule defined by some doctrinal difference, a **cult **by allegiance to an idea or commanding personality.   

  
Though the word may be used without the derogatory sense, as it stands today, the primary meaning of "cult" is indeed negative with the sense of extremism, falsehood, eccentric, et cetera.  
  
Having said that, languages like English change with time, "black" was considered offensive once but is not considered offensive today. "Gay" primarily meant happy just some decades ago, but now almost nobody uses it in that sense. So while we may want to avoid such words, it may not be worth making an issue out of it. I find Dr. Bhat's email very enlightening in this regard.
