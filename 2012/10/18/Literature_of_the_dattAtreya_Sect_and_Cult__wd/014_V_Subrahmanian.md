The Author, in 1932 or before, writes in his preface:  
  
//Notwithstanding the efforts, and achievements of Indian and foreign scholars, Indian philosophical systems have not been properly understood and appreciated in the West. At the present time, Indian misrepresen- tations of Indian philosophy are working greater havoc in the thought- world than foreign misrepresentations. Indian misrepresentations of Indian thought circulated by certain prize-boys are advertised for public con- sumption by certain publishers and journals in the West. There is an organised attempt to glorify outrageous misrepresentations of Indian Phi- losophy into profound truths. The truths of Indian philosophy traditionally transmitted and embodied in the Sanskrit classics are obscured by the showy style, egregious epigrams, and the trickish terminology of the prize-boys of philosophic imperialism. The Theistic system of Madhva (Anandatirtha) is practically un- known in the West, though brief references have been made to it, and short essays written on it. In India, knowledge of the details of the system is a monopoly of the Pandits, as the works of Madhva are written in terse terminology, and as commentaries on them are technical -and voluminous. That is why no systematic exposition of the works of Madhva and his commentators has been attempted by Indian philoso- phers who are in the habit of writing for the benefit of international audiences, and for the purpose of pushing Indian philosophy within the focus of International Awareness. My ambitions and aspirations are limited. I write hoping to elicit a response from all students of philosophy, and the lay public as well, possessing the scholar's outook and desire to know the details of hither- to little known system of philosophy. It seems pointless to ask whether European and American, or even Indian critics for the matter of that, would accord a welcome to a Theistic system, when the predominant modern tendency appears to be towards Monism, and Absolutism. If research in philosophy is to be genuine, it should throw light on new systems, new in the sense hitherto not properly and systematically pre- sented. I have, therefore, attempted an exposition of the ten important works of Madhva which reveal systematic evolution of his system. //  
  
That shows that he is not of a category of school children. Here are some paragraphs where he uses the word 'cult' :  
  
//There was a circumambient atmosphere of discontent with the tenets of the Advaita engendered by the **cult of Bhakti,** presumably promulgated by Ramanuja. Madhva laid specially great emphasis on it. It was further developed by the Chaitanya School still flour- ishing in Bengal . A full and complete surrender of the entire Finite Personality to the Infinite surrender of everything held near and dear.//  
  
//Summing up, the following were the marked contemporary tendencies that exercised an effective influence on "the formation of the Philosophical System of Madhva : (1) The continuance of the anti-Buddhistic feelings engendered prominently in the Age of Sankara ; (2) Dissatisfaction with the Absolutism of Sankara in general and with the doctrine of the Identity of the Finite Individual with the Infinite in parti- cular ; (3) **The cult of Bhakti** with its alluring implication of the possibility and practicality of a deep and intimate personal relationship with the Deity ; (4) Discontent with the sweeping Cosmopolitanism of Ramarmja ; and (5) the increasing popularity of Logic, technical methods, canons of debate, and controversy. It is easy to see while some of the tendencies were calculated to lead to destructive results, others paved the way for systematic construc- tive thinking and system-building.//  
  
//4. Discontent with the doctrines of Advaita and the rising influence of **the cult of Bhakti** were among the important forces that moulded and systcmatised Madhva's speculation. //  
  
// VISHNU TATVA VINIRN A YA 311-- An analysis of instances of productive imagination would convince anyone that a barren woman's son can marry a barren woman's darling daughter and in utter defiance of **the modern cult of birth control worship most effectively the cult of fecundity!!** All perceptual illusions have to be described as asat. They are non-existent. Yet non-existence does not mean non-appearance in experience as an object of some apprehension. /  
  
// There is another criticism going round that Madhva's system of philosophy belongs more to the religious history of India than to the philosophical. What exactly is the point of this criticism, the present writer has not been able to see, but does the author of the criticism seek to maintain that Madhva spent his days in organising denominational and relgious sects, schools, and synods, or in the popularisation **of a cult like Tantricism popular in another part of India**? Does he mean that the Acharya spent his time in narrating folk-lore, religious tales and stories to his followers?//  
  
**End of excerpts**  
  
One can see the various shades of meanings in which the author, of the early part of the last century, has used the word 'cult'. One might conclude that the author was not correctly informed of the meaning of the word. But I would rather go by the explanation that he has used it in the sense of 'movement', for example the term 'Bhakti movement' used quite liberally by Dr.B.N.K.Sharma in his writings, one example I am giving here. There is what is popularly known as 'dAsa kooTa' and 'vyAsa kooTa' which also mean the same. (see Thesaurus above)  
  
<http://content.iskcon.org/icj/11/04-gupta.html>  
// B. N. K. Sharma suggests that a link may be found in Visnu Puri, the author of *Bhaktiratnavali,* who is said to have been a disciple of the Madhva *sannyasi* Jayadhvaja (or Jayadharma). ‘Most probably, it was this Visnu Puri, who was the real founder of the **Bhakti Movement** in the North and the teachers Laksmipati, Madhavendra Puri and Isvara were descended from him . . .’ (Sharma 1981, p. 526). //

//The earliest among them was Shri Prasanna Venkata Dasa. But it was Shri Vijaya Dasa and his disciples who were responsible for the spreading of **Vadiraja cult** in Karnataka.//  
  
//In the introduction one finds a studied analysis of how the **Vadiraja cult** went on spreading and more so in the northern areas of Karnataka.//  
  
In this example one can see the meaning 'following' shown in the Thesaurus above. I have seen Dr.S.K.Ramachandra Rao using the term 'Madhva persuasion' to refer to Swami SatyadhyAna Tirtha (not derogatorily) of the UttarAdi mutt. Dr.Rao has been awarded titles and honoured by Madhwa Mutts.   
  
Surely these authors who have used the word 'cult' are neither non-Indians nor do they want to denigrate the personalities/topics they are portraying in their writings.  
  
One can have one's own preferences for meanings and usages of words.
What I think is that the 'vaktA's vivakshA in that usage is what decides the meaning. The examples I have provided above and in my earlier post are of this type.
