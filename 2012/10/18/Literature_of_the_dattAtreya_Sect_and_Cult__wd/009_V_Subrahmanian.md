Here are some examples of the use of the word 'cult' in a non-derogatory sense:

Devotion to Vishnu as a monotheistic Deity is referred to for the first time in the Mahabharata, compiled probably two or three centuries before the common era, and it is apparent that devotional groups have been in existence since that period and possibly earlier. *These early cults are referred to as Bhagavatas, Pancaratras and Vaikhanasas, and appear to have been strongest in South India.* Today these early groups have largely been absorbed into later sects, though Vaikhanasa priests still officiate in a few of the south Indian temples.

The Shri Vaishnavas are today a major sect and are particularly prominent in the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu. *They were founded by the renowned teacher Ramanuja (1018-1137CE) who was himself initiated into the earlier cults of Southern Vaishnavism.* Ramanuja taught a devotional form of Vedanta which postulated a Supreme Personal Deity who existed in his own domain and also within each being. Today the Shri Vaishnavas control many of the major Vaishnava shrines in Tamil Nadu with brahmana priests officiating over the temple worship in accordance with strict regulations. They are now divided into two sub-groups, the Vatakalai northern branch and the Tengalai southern branch. Apart from geography, principal differences between the two groups centre on the question of whether divine grace is an absolute path to salvation and on the use of the Sanskrit or Tamil languages.

The Nimavat cult was founded by Nimbarka, a South Indian brahmana who stressed that salvation is gained through the efforts of the devotee in endeavouring to render service to Vishnu or his earthly manifestation as Krishna. The Nimavats have probably always been a small sect, but have shrines and centres spread throughout India.

*The Vitthalas or Varkari Panthis are another of the medieval Vaishnava cults.* Founded in the 13th century by Vitthala, a Vaishnava saint and preacher, the sect has persisted into modern times with its main centre at Pandharpur in Southern Maharashtra and is notable for its emphasis on the custom of making pilgrimages to the shrines of saints.
