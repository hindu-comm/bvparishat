\> Definition of CULT

\> 1

\> 2

The Oxford dictionary has it better: "a relatively small group of people having religious beliefs or practices regarded by others as strange or sinister: a network of Satan-worshiping cults," etc.  
  
Likewise, a "sect" is (per the OED), "a group of people with somewhat different religious beliefs (typically regarded as heretical) fromthose of a larger group to which they belong.  
• \[often derogatory\] a group that has separated from an established church; a nonconformist church.  
• a philosophical or political group, esp. one regarded as extreme or dangerous."  

  
\> Here are some examples of the use of the word 'cult' in a non-derogatory sense:  
\>  
\> <http://www.philtar.ac.uk/encyclopedia/hindu/devot/geness.html>  
\> Devotion to Vishnu as a monotheistic Deity is referred to for the first time in the Mahabharata, compiled probably two or three centuries before the common era, and it is apparent that devotional groups have been in existence since that period and possibly earlier. These early cults are referred to as Bhagavatas, Pancaratras and Vaikhanasas, and appear to have been strongest in South India. Today these early groups have largely been absorbed into later sects, though Vaikhanasa priests still officiate in a few of the south Indian temples.  
  
\> The Shri Vaishnavas are today a major sect and are particularly prominent in the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu. They were founded by the renowned teacher Ramanuja (1018-1137CE) who was himself initiated into the earlier cults of Southern Vaishnavism. Ramanuja taught a devotional form of Vedanta which postulated a Supreme Personal Deity who existed in his own domain and also within each being. Today the Shri Vaishnavas control many of the major Vaishnava shrines in Tamil Nadu  
  

I do not accept these as non-derogatory examples. They rather show the Eurocentrism and rather obvious illiberal overtones (leftovers from overt 18th- and 19th-century racism which was never completely disowned by later Indologists) of much of Western scholarship about India. Words like "idol," "sect," etc., are used, automatically consigning the Indian heritage to second-class status. Such words are not used in reference to mainstream Judeo-Christian traditions that the authors respect.
