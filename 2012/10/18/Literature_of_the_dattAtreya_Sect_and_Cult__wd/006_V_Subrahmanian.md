In Karnataka there is a tradition of Datta cult which gives prominence to the study/pArAyaNa of what is called 'gurucharitre'. It is the mAhAtmya of Datta Guru and people make pilgrimages to 'gANigApura' in Karanataka and even live there for a few days on 'bhikshA' mode. There are households there which offer bhikShaa to these pilgrims in the belief that Lord Datta Himself comes in the form of these devotees to take bhikShA.  
  
There are Dattopaasakas who celebrate Datta Jayanti with great rigour.
It is a ten-day tapas with mouna, upavAsa, japa, pAraayaNa, etc. culminating in homa and santarpaNa (feeding a number of invited devotees) coupled with dAnam. I know of a sAmavedin scholar in Sringeri who is a dattopAsaka named Sri Ramamurthy SrouthigaL. He has a great collection of material on Dattatreya. He lives in the agraharam called Vidyaranyapura in his house named 'datta kuTira'. On his prayerful request, the Sringeri Jagadguru would visit this function every year and bless him.
