Literature of the Dattātreya Sect and Cult

Dear Colleagues,

I shall be much obliged to have reference to the available published or unpublished literature, if any, of the Dattātreya cult and sect. I have the Puranic references to Dattātreya with me. Till now my another success in the search has been locating a group of roaming sādhus in HImachal Pradesh who stubbornly refused to be drawn into any dialogue! I am also informed of a later Chalukya sculpture of Dattatreya and a “Medieval Puranic text consisting of a dialogue between sage Dattatreya and king Janaka, issued in Publications de l'Institut Orientaliste de Louvain series.” But I could not gain access to the publication  
  

The information may be posted to my private email address or to the B.V. Parishad.

With thanks in apprehension and best wishes for all.

Dipak Bhattacharya
