\> Even the American Heritage Dictionary gives this as the primary meaning of "cult":

\> a. A religion or religious sect generally considered to be extremist or false, with its followers often living in an unconventional manner under the guidance of an authoritarian, charismatic leader.  
\> b. The followers of such a religion or sect.

Who cares? That is not a standard, and besides, a dictionary and a thesaurus are not interchangeable -- the former defines meanings and usages, and the latter is used to find the mot juste when one has a general idea.

This merely shows what Dr. Sarma thought was the expected usage when he was writing his Ph.D. thesis in the heyday of the British Raj in the early 20th century. This and your other examples have no probative value in this regard because these authors are not acknowledged as authorities of English usage, unlike Henry Watson Fowler, Eric Partridge, etc. It is against common sense to follow the lead of someone in matters where they are not authoritative; it is also against the Vedic dictum of यान्यनवद्यानि कर्माणि \| तानि सेवितव्यानि \| नो इतराणि \| यान्यस्माकं सुचरितानि \| तानि त्वयोपास्यानि \| नो इतराणि \|
