A rather confused way of putting things, I'm afraid: "worship" and "veneration" are distinct in Roman Catholicism so it is not straightforward to connect them with an "or" -- only God is an object of worship, and the various Catholic saints are to be venerated. The use of "cult" for the followers of a saint also connotes a smaller group with devotion to a lesser entity rather than something which is mainstream. By the way, the use of "cult" in reference to Catholics may also be derogatory; many WASP writers hate Catholicism.  
  
I'll stick with the OED (as do serious academics; Merriam Webster's is for school children).  
  
Even the American Heritage Dictionary gives this as the primary meaning of "cult":  
  
a. A religion or religious sect generally considered to be extremist or false, with its followers often living in an unconventional manner under the guidance of an authoritarian, charismatic leader.  
b. The followers of such a religion or sect.
