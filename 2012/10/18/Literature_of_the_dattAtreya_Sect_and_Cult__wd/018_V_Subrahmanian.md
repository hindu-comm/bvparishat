Let it be, but that is not the **only** sense in which the word is used, as dozens of examples have been shown. There are other senses like following, persuasion, religion, school (like the commonly used 'schools' of Vedanta to refer to Advaita, etc.) of the word. What is to be noted is the vivakShA of the vaktA in determining whether he is using it derogatorily or not.   
  
In fact the English-Snaksrit dictionary of V.S.Apte gives for 'cult' = see 'creed' and when we look what is there for 'creed' it says: धर्मः, स्वीकृतमतं, पक्षः. A friend who lives in the US now recently told me that he has 'converted' to Vaishnavism. He told his smArta (Chennai based) parents that he is doing so. His case is clearly the स्वीकृतमतं. Does it have any derogatory sense as it has the English word 'cult' at the base? Likewise there are people who were born into Madhva/srIvaishnava families and have 'taken' Advaita as स्वीकृतमतं.
Generally Matrimonial ads have this expression 'sub-sects no bar'. The 'vaDakalai and tenkalai' are generally referred to as 'sects' of the Ramanuja system. Surely there is an 'allegiance to a particular personality/idea/practice' in these cases. Even today there are people in these sects who are very strict when it comes to inter-marrying.
There are court cases even today as to which 'nAma' is to be applied on the forehead of the presiding deity, the gopuram and the elephant in Melkote/Kanchipuram. The 'vaDama', 'brahacharanam,' etc. are sects among Tamil smArta-s. No one can give any derogatory sense to these usages.
Such doctrinal differences are there even among Madhvas owing allegiance to particular Mutts, Swamijis, etc.

There is no way how one determines what the 'primary' meaning is. No one is an authority as we see differences among lexicographers.

We can add to it words like 'vidhava, widow, physically handicapped, divorcee, etc.' A few years ago I read in Chennai buses: 'uDal UnamuTRor' for physically handicapped. During my recent trip I found this change: 'mATRu tiranALigaL" which is a translation of 'differently abled'. Misraji, your designation bears this 'offensive' word :-) (no offense meant).
