It depends on the point of view one holds.

  

Not only English, but in Sanskrit, also.

  

There is a line

  

"या भवतः प्रिया"

  

simply meaning who is your beloved. If one wants to make it अश्लील, it can be read as without the space which cannot be maintained in in pronunciation strictly:

  

"याभवतः प्रिया"

  

derived from यभ "मैथुने" याभः अस्यास्तीति याभवतः"

  

This line is from दण्डी, who maintains the view "तदल्पमपि नोपेक्ष्यं काव्ये दुष्टं कथं चन"

स्याद् वपुः सुन्दरमपि श्वित्रेणैकेन दुर्लभम्॥"

  

whereas कालिदास is liberal on the issue:

  

"एको हि दोषो गुणसंनिपाते निमज्जतीवेन्दोः किरणेष्वेवाङ्कः" considering many good aspects, some undesirable can be ignored.

  

And wise men say, who are called दोषज्ञः and also विपश्चित् (विशेषेण पश्यतीति), uses his knowledge to increase his own knowledge बुधः and share with others the good things he knows with others:

  

गुणदोषौ बुधो गृह्णन्निन्दुक्षेडाविवेश्वरः।

शिरसा श्लाघते पूर्वं परं कण्ठे नियच्छति॥

  

  

Though one knows the good aspects and bad aspects of anything, like ईश्वर he applauds with nodding the good aspects (and shares with his friends) while he suppresses the bad aspects in himself (so that he can use the knowledge for himself to safeguard against such errors being commiitted.)

  

and also

  

"बालादपि गृह्णीयात् सुभाषितम्।"

"गुणाः पूजास्थानं गुणिषु न च लिङ्गं न च वयः।"

  
I leave the scholars to take right decision at the right point in a topic. Hope this is understood by every member of this forum as it is not only a संस्कृतपरिषत् only, but भारतीय-विद्वत्परिषत्.

  

I do not want myself to make any personal criticism. This is just a thought occurred to me as I read the development this topic takes turn.
