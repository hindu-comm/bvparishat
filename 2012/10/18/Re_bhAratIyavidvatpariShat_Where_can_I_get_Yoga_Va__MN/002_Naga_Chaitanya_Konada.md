Hi Aryas,

  

Thanks for all the links. I was actually thinking of buying a hard-copy. If you have any suggestions, please let me know.

  

I would be glad to know the publishing house and other details like ISBN number, etc.

  

I also would like to know if this book is available in Telugu script.

  

Your support is much appreciated. Thanks.

  

**Note**: The below link in [archive.org](http://archive.org) is looking good actually, but the letters are not clear.

  

Thanks & Regards,  
**Naga Chaitanya Konada** \| *0-812-5636-944*
