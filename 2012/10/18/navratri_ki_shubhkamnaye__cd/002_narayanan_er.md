Respected Sir,

No problem to copy your views to BVP, Sir, criticism is open, to err is human to forgive is devine. First about Navasu (nine) and Navaasu (new). Both fit to the metre. Each and every Navaratri is new in every year. That is why it is a deliberate usage: रात्रीष्वासु नवासु (new) देवि! नवसू (nine) रक्षाशु सत्सङ्गतान्।। No breach of metrical balance.  

Then, Upaksheeyate. (upa+kshi kshaye. passive. being disintegrated, being declined) what? the punishment as well. The attributions to those having crooked or wicked ways, go freely with carataam without any interference. The anxiety for the attributions of the crooked fellows will easily take the rest: दुर्वृत्तैश्चरतां कुपुष्टधनिकैः सत्यं पिधायोन्नतैः। Then, tu (but), the justice is being buried and extensively (api), the range of punishment has been disintegrated from its deserved requirements. This is what I intended. Sorry, Sir, if any further problem here. If one produces something spontaneously, the lack of his talent will always be projected. But if one has talent, it can cover up the grammatical problems, says Aanandavardhana, it reads:

अव्युत्पत्तिकृतो दोषः शक्त्या संव्रियते कवेः।

यस्त्वशक्तिकृतो दोषो झडित्येवावभासते।। (ध्वन्यालोकः-३-उद्योतः)

More corrections are welcome.

Regards,

Narayanan
