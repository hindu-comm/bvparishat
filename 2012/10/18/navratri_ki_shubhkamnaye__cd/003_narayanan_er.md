Professor Aklujkar and Sh.Nityanand,  
First of all I thank Sh. Nityanand for correction. It was not a typo error, but a mistake due to my oversight. Admitting mistakes also gives good relief. And there is no excuse for me rather than correcting it. I am sorry for the delay in reply. I changed रक्षा to त्रायस्व and that problem is resolved. It was not that I didn't knew नवसु (the plural locative for nine) and नवासु (the plural locative for new), but due to the lack of attention I unnecessarily thought about an impossible of a रलोप and रपर factor from रक्षा and forced me to think about a पूर्वाण्दीर्घ and my absurdity in irrelevant thoughts forced me to extend the vowel उ of नवसु।(And, look!! How absurd it is!!!) If I did not had this posted in BVP, how Sh. Nityanand can correct me. So, here is the corrected one:  

नीतिस्त्वत्र निहन्यते कुपथिनां दण्डोऽप्युपक्षीयते  
दुर्वृत्तैश्चरतां कुपुष्टधनिकैः सत्यं पिधायोन्नतैः।  
पिष्ट्वा दुष्टततीः सुपेषमधुना तान् रक्तबीजोपमान्  

रात्रीष्वासु नवासु देवि! नवसु त्रायस्व सत्सङ्गतान्।।  
And, moreover, Sh.Nityanand, I quote what Professor Aklujkar wrote: "In the last quarter, if you mean the number nine (navan), then the form should be navasu, which will not fit the metre. If you mean nava 'new', the form will fit, but what will be the contextual significance?"   
According to this statement, if I would have put (although repeatedly) (syllables-5, 6, 7) नवासु (the plural locative for new), (syllables-10, 11, 12) then the 11th syllable is guru which would have harmed the metre. Actually Professor Aklujkar wanted to know about the contextual significance of novelty of those nights, which I explained in the previous mail.  
I sincerely thank both of you for correcting my mistakes.  
Regards,  
Narayanan
