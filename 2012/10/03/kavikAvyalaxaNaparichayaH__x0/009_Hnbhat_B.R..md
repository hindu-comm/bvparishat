The examples in Sanskrit are well governed in Sanskrit by the rule*अचो रहाभ्यां द्वे*॥*८*।*४*।*४५ consonants after r and h, preceded by a vowel and not followed by a vowel.***and similar rules in other cases, in conjunct letters, also optionally by the next 5 rules. after vowels.**

**Our Brahma discussed long ago for its distinct pronunciation in our group, comes in the second sequence. But the duplication is optional ब्रह्मा. The examples cited by Narayanan simply follows the rule for Sanskrit for consonants after "r". For others, the reason in common to Tamil seems to be that only the first and last of the Vargya consonants were common for Tamil and Malayalam alphabet long ago and so to distinguish from the 2nd, 3rd and 4th, the first k, c, t, T, p are duplicated to be pronounced as surds clearly, while others are not commonly used in Tamil words. बालक, पालक, फालक, or भालक would be written equally using the same letters. But only in the initial position, the "p" is duplicated for clarity. I don't think Sanskrit words are not used as such in Tamil, but in both they used Grantha script to write Sanskrit texts. This seems to be the reason for this convention of duplication probably after a short vowel. May not be after long vowel if any used in Tamil. The Prakrit grammar also has the convention recognized in तद्भव words derived from Sanskrit, used after short vowels, initial consonants duplicated.
