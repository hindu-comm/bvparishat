Thanks a lot for the explanation. After posting I realized that  
Malayalam too has this phenomenon.

To some extent even Sanskrit takes a somewhat similar form,  
optionally, in some traditions/places: उपर्य्युपरि, कर्म्म, धर्म्म,  
कार्य्यम्, कुर्य्यात्, etc. and some other languages writing: कृष्ण्ण,  
etc.
