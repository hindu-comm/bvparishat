There is a famous Brihadaranyaka vaakyam:  
  
’अस्य महतो भूतस्य निःश्वसितमेतद्यदृग्वेदः’ (भ्र्.ऊ.२.४.१०). In one Edition this mantra is printed as .....निश्वसितमेतद्...In the bhashyam portion however we see...निःश्वसितमेतत्..निःश्वसितमिव निःश्वसितम् ।
।...यथाऽप्रयत्नेनैव पुरुषनिःश्वासो भवति....In the editorial footnote we have: निःश्वसितमिति - अनायासेन निस्सृतमित्यर्थः।  
  
In the English translation of the above Upanishad Swami Madhavananda says: ...like the breath of ....As a man breathes without the slightest effort...  
  
’अस्य महतो भूतस्य निःश्वसितमेतद्यदृग्वेदः’ (भ्र्.ऊ.२.४.१०). is quoted by Shankaracharya in the Brahmasutra bhashyam शास्त्रयोनित्वात् 1.1.3.
Here Swami Gambhirananda translates: 'Those that are called Rg Veda...are but the exhalation of this great Being.'  
  
So, one takes it as 'breath'. It could mean breathing in and breathing out. The other takes it as 'exhalation' which means 'breathing out' which is what the Upanishad is conveying as an example for the 'coming out' of the Vedas from Brahman.   
  
We have the words उच्छ्वासः / निःश्वासः . In this scheme it looks like the 'ut' and 'niH' prefixes are used. Will निश्वासः mean नितरां (not निर्गमित/निस्सृत) श्वासः?
