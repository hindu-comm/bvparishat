Dear Shri Nityanand Misra, Namaste!



My question: निःश्वासः and निश्वासः are these two different words? If they are different what is the difference in their meanings? I am asking this question because you mentioned that निस्and नि are two different prefixes. Thanks. N.R.JOSHI.

No doubt both are correct घञ्ञन्त forms but result from different prefixes. निस् + श्वस् + घञ् gives निःश्वासः or निश्श्वासः. Whereas नि + श्वस् + घञ् gives निश्वासः.  
  
निः + श्वासः cannot become निश्वासः by the वार्त्तिक on 8-3-36 which permits the optional elision of विसर्ग. The reason is that even though श्व् is a शरादिसंयुक्त, it is not a खर्परशरादिसंयुक्त as required by the वार्त्तिक since the consonant व् is not included in the खर् प्रत्याहार.
