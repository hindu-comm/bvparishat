>   
> 2. to give a rudimentary biography of this prolific Vedic scholar.  
>   
> However, contributions are not confined to Vedic Studies. Frits'  
> interest in India was wide and deep. All Indologists should feel  
> free and welcome to contribute their thoughts and memories, as we  
> witnessed earlier this year when news of Frits' passing first  
> circulated among us some six months ago.
