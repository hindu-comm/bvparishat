Dear Rani Sadashivamurthyvaryaah, svasti \|



Diction of Aho Dravyapremi is simple and the message of the same is
clear.The ones who alwayscontemplate the financial achievements neglect or ignorelove oftheir own family members.In my view,it can have some more verses.Instead ofthe death of the father, hisrepenting may be enough.

  
prashnita(verse 15) may be kindly avoided.
