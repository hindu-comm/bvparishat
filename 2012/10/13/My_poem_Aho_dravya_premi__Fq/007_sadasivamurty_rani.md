Dear Sri Sundareswaran Ji!  
Pranams,  
Thanks a lot. Your suggestion regarding pathantaram is very much valuable. But there are two reasons for using  
'ca karam'.  
1. To maintain alliterative beauty between cakara and ca karam in the foot.  
2. The word "car" was is seen in the sense of a vehicle of self mobilizing efficiency. Hence I used it.  
परि प्रासिष्यदतकवि: सिन्धोरूर्मावधि श्रित: कारं बिभ्रत्पुरुस्प्रुहम्। (ऋ. ९.१४.१)  
  

Here the word कारं is used to speak about an automobile vehicle that can move on the surface of the earth, water and space. Hence I took that word from that source. Of course it may be a venture yet my motivating source is from the said source.  

Pranams once again,  

**Dr. Rani Sadasiva Murty**
