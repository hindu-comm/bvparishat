Dear Sir,

I must confess that Yajna is a very complex term in our Vedic literature. Basically any activity performed individually or by a group
with an object of bringing welfare to all (yourself included) can be termed a Yajna.

However most of the times such activities were accompanied by Agnihotra. Agnihotra could be a very simple to a very elaborate activity.

Although credit goes to Namboodiri families and similar less known groups that have persevered in preserving the ancient ritualistic forms of Yajnas, but as on date I doubt if any scholar can claim to throw light on the significance of various rituals that are carried out.Also the environment and society have undergone a sea change from the Vedic period. Hence it can not be expected that various Yajnas performed today with doubtful original skills , will provide the results that are attributed to them in Vedas.

I have tried to understand this in context of making rains by Yajnas. A note attached here will explain the position with respect to rain making yagnas. Similar inferences should be drawn about other Yajnas.

To my knowledge no literature exists on Yajnas to help understanding them from practical point of view.

I am also attaching a small note on Yajnas.

With best regards,

Subodh Kumar
