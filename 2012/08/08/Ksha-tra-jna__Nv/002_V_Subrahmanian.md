Nice write up Sir.  
  
We have the name 'अक्षमाला’ to refer to the japamAlA that Saraswati holds in one hand. In Kannada they say the alphabet string is called 'अक्षरमाला’. Quite coincidentally, the letters in your title 'क्ष, त्र, ज्ञ’ are found in the famous 'क्षेत्रज्ञः’ of the Bhagavadgita 13th Chapter.
