Yes, there is such a notion in Rajasthan. The reason is that Samskrit medium, i.e. text books meant for teaching through Samskrit medium, were introduced without teacher training, even without introductory workshops for Samskrit teachers. This is a well known fact that Samskrit teachers through out the country are not equipped/competent for teaching Samskrit through Samskrit because they were not taught through Samskrit during their studies, and again, in-service teacher training for Samskrit teachers is seldom held. Hence not the Samskrit medium, but the way it was introduced was a problem.

When 'Direct Method' was introduced in English Language Teaching 1920 by English Education Council, London, The English Grammar Schools through out Europe, opposed it since the teachers in those schools were teaching English through Grammar Translation Method. Then English Education Council conducted Orientation Courses for teachers continuously for four years and then English through English became a reality.

I would be posting another article on 'Samskrit through Samskrit' soon, may we discuss this particular issue thread bare after I post that article?
