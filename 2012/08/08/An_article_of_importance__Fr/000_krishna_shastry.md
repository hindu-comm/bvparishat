Dear Scholars,

Though I had posted this Article in this group yesterday, I came to know that it did not open in a few computers. Hence it is being posted again,

More over, this is a smaller file.  
The article discusses the present difficult situation being faced by Samskrit.

The present situation is the result of our "inaction" or inability to properly understand and prioritize our "actions" in the last one or two decades.

Today if we repeat the same, within the next two or three decades, our children would see the fall of Samskrit to the unimaginable nadir.

Taking refuge under the rhetoric that "Samskrit is Amarabhasha" "no need to protect, it will protect itself" will be an excuse to one's inaction or unwillingness to act.

I earnestly appeal to every one of you to read and act.

Please pardon me for using harsh words both in this letter and the article.

If any one of you want to personally convey anything to me, you may kindly do the same to the following ID - [krishna...@hotmail.com]()
