dear sir,

thanks for your thought provoking paper on the sanskrit education.  

though I am not expert in this issue,here is a small observation on it.

Many people in Rajasthan opine that by **making compulsory to write answers in sanskrit instead of hindi or english is one thing that making things difficult for students**. it is taking sheen of sanskrit as a paper.

  

we have to think about this and find a good solution.
