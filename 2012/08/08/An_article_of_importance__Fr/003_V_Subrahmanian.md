In the 'shatAvadhAnam' program of last Saturday at Bangalore, almost all the 'pRcchaka-s' who were in Dr. S.R.Ganesh's team were qualified Engineers who had not undergone any formal education in Samskrtam. Yet their knowledge in both conversational and composing Sanskrit verses in difficult meters on any given subject on the spot was amazing. Dr. Ganesh said that these persons had picked up so much Samskrtam by their own efforts and come to such a high level. It was indeed inspiring to be there in that program.  
  
Each of us who are into samskrtam at any level has a responsibility in furthering one's own knowledge and also disseminating knowledge to others. I engage in gathering neighboring children and teaching them small stories from 'sambhAShaNa sandeshaH' or 'Rasanaa' by asking them to read the lines and explain the meaning myself. Generating interest in learning Samskrtam and nurturing it has to be a lifelong mission.
Teaching subhAShitas, explaining the meanings and asking them to commit them to memory is also a fine exercise. Stotra teaching also comes in this group.
