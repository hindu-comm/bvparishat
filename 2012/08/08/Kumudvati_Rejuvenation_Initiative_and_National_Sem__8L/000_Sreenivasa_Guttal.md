Abhivaadaye,

  

This weekend is a festival for people concerned with Water, River, Tirthakshetra's:)

  

**Sri Rajendra Singh, Water-man of India from Rajasthan, and winner of Ramon Magsaysay Award for his stupendous work in rejuvenating seven rivers in Rajasthan will be in Bangalore participating in two major events on Saturday (August 11th) and Sunday (August 12th).**

  

***Kumudvati Rejuvenation Initiative***

  

Purnapramati, an alternative school, is working on the theme "Water as Life" in the current academic year.It is an experiment to involve young kids in real life social contexts.****As you may be aware,**River Kumudvat**i along with River Arkavati was one of the prime sources of water for the population in and around Bangalore. But unfortunately, the flow of Kumudvati has been affected badly in the recent decades. Purnapramati is planning to work on the catchment area of this river, starting from Shivaganga hills to TG halli reservoir.

  

The school started this year by visiting Shivaganga hills on Bhagirathi Jayanti (30th June 2012, symbolizing water day) where river Kumudvati originates. Now, on August 11th, Purnapramati is visiting Shivganga and will launch the Kumudvati rejuvenation program involving the local communities.

  

The day long program will involve launching of rejuvenation, relevant cultural programs in a local school at Shivaganga, tree planting program along the feeding streams of Kumudvati, cleaning of Pushkarani (small pond), Presentation on major rivers of India by kids, Vichara Samkirana with farmers (Discussions) at mid point of Kumudvati River etc.

  

**Sri Rajendra Singh, Modern Day Bhagiratha, will accompany Purnapramati kids and participate for the whole day program.Many dignitaries from premier institutes and social organizations will participate in this socio-educational movement of a new kind, spearheaded by children.**

  

***National Seminar on Rejuvenation of Tirthakshetra***  
  

**Description:**



Tirthakshetras form the bedrock of cultural identity of Indian society. The idea of Tirthakshetra, is not just limited to a religious activities, but play significantly role in defining entire eco-system. Visiting tirthasketras is one of the fundamental duties of devotees in many religions, and it is particularly so in our Hindu traditions. During ancient times, people travelled thousands of kilometers by foot to reach holy places and earn blessings of the lord. Yaatras to tirthakshetras continue to be an important aspect of Hinduism today, as witnessed in the number of people who turn up for aaradhanas or kumbhasnaanas.The modernity and ease of transportation in the last century has enormously contributed in increasing number of visiting tirthakshetras even in remote locations.



However, modernity has also had its own negative effects and has resulted in new challenges. In the process of following rituals, getting darshana and snaana and moving on quickly with our busy modern lives, our generation seems to have forgotten to take care of the very same tirthasketras. At the very basic level, the current day tirthasketras are hardly clean. Plastic materials are thrown, soaps are abundantly used in the very same holy rivers from which devotees who seek to cleanse their paapas. We have forgotten the ecological importance of the kalyaanis, rivers and forests we so much worship. More generally, our generation seems to have forgotten the holistic ideal of a tirthayaatra which has led to dramatic changes in the dynamics of such yaatras, how yaatris perceive yaatras as well as holy places themselves. Role of local communities has also decreased due to multiple factors.



The aim of this half a day seminar is to create awareness among yaatris, local communities and administrators on what they can do to improve our tirthakshetras, and to develop a holistic perspective about Tirthakshetra. Distinguished speakers ranging from ecological conservationists to administrators to Peethadipathis will look at what aspects abouttirthakshetras have changed with modernity, why they have changed, what have been their implications that we often not notice and what we as yaatris, local communities and religious administration, all can resolve to improve the future.
