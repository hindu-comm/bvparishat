Obviously this has nothing to do with the issue of वर्णमाला, except that all the three वर्ण-s or three letters are used in the same word. Further, in another message, the question was raised by Prof.Anil, why Panini had not included these letters in the वर्णमाला in the form of माहेश्वरसूत्र and hence the question is related with the usage by us and Panini. We had given the usages of Panini in his अष्टाध्यायी, but in the माहेश्वरसूत्र-s they do not find place. Probably, these three are considered as वर्ण-s, in the consideration तान्त्रिक-वर्णमाला as suggested by the citation in the शब्दकल्पद्रुम and Ganeshan, and वर्णमाला in general, as we learn from the orthographic representation of them in the alphabetical order for facilitating learning For Tantric purpose, in yantra-s these are written and there is a concept of लिपि-सरस्वती, and none of the letters are omitted completeness. In alphabet, general, only the दीर्घ is included, and not the प्लुत, which is indicated by adding he number of total ३ मात्रा-s after  

  

It is due to this confusion with the other thread, Mr. Subrahmanyam just showed the three letters used in one word in this topic (different from or similar to the other).

तव करकमलस्थां स्फाटिकीमक्षमालां

नखरकिरणभिन्नां दाडिमीबीजबुद्ध्या।

अनुकलमनुकर्षन्येन कीरो निरुद्ध:

स भवतु मम भूत्यै वाणि ते मन्दहास: ।। 2 ।।

  

So it is अक्षमाला held in the hands of वाणी, as the above verse from धर्माकूत commentary makes it clear. It can be used as जपमाला, or मणिमाला suggesting its usage. whether counting the number of japa or worn as ornament.

  

The same picture is to be seen in श्यामलादण्डक also. Different forms of Sarasvati images can be seen in this link:
