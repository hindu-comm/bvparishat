Dear Sri S. Vidyasankarji and Other Scholars,  

Hari Om! Salutations.  
  

Went through your mail on Sambhūti and Asambhūti. Your explanation, taking into consideration the exact words of the text with the help of the Ghanapāṭha, throws a lot of light on the difficulty that the commentator encounters in interpreting the verse. Thanks for sharing. It was indeed very useful.

  

In case you come across any references in the Vedic or other literature on the very practice of both these two Upāsanās, do share with me. I did refer the Yoga-sutra that you referred to (1.19). But I need more information on how these Upāsanās are practiced.

  

I am also of the opinion of Yogaśāstra being of in the sadhana aspect of Vedanta especially in the practice of the Samadhis (Savikalpa and Nirvikalpa) which are advised for vāsanākṣaya and manonāśa leading to the experience of Jīvanmukti. Such discussions are elaborate in Jīvanmuktiviveka of Svāmi Vidyāraṇya and Yogavaśiṣṭha too. Svāmi Vidyāraṇya even explains the relevant Yogasūtras in hisJīvanmuktiviveka.

  

Once again grateful for your input and all the inputs I have received on my query from Sri H.N. Bhatji, Sri V.Subramanianji, and Sri Narasimhacharyaji.

  

In Shri Guru Smriti,  
Advayananda
