ISAvAsyopanishat verses 9-11 and 12-14 and their commentary by Sankara are definitely not easy to understand. Let me first address the question with respect to padaccheda of the verse beginning saMbhUtiM ca vinASam. I transliterate anusvAraas M, with (g) to indicate its yajurvedic pronunciation peculiarity where necessary, avagraha as ' and svara accents are not shown.



The ghanapATha for this verse starts: saMbhUtiM ca ca saMbhUti(g)M saMbhUtim ca vinASaM vinASaM ca sambhUti(g)M saMbhUtiM ca vinASam.



Therefore, the first pada is saMbhUtiM only, as per the recitation. As such, one should not expect a sandhi between the last syllable of the previous verse and the first syllable of the present verse. The SAnkara bhAshya also does not appeal to sandhi in the comment about a-varNa lopa.



More interestingly, note the ghana for the words in the third line of this verse: tIrtvA saMbhUtyA saMbhUtyA tIrtvA tIrtvA saMbhUtyAmRtam amRta(gg)s saMbhUtyA tIrtvA tIrtvA saMbhUtyAmRtam.



This makes it clear that the corresponding pada-s are tIrtvA, saMbhUtyA and amRtam. In this place too, as per the recitation practice, the pada is saMbhUtyA only, not asaMbhUtyA.



Compare with ghanapATha for a portion of the verse which first introduces saMbhUti and asaMbhUti.



viSanti ye ye viSanti viSanti ye'saMbhUtim asaMbhUtiM ye viSanti viSanti ye'saMbhUtim.

ye'saMbhUtim asaMbhUtiM ye ye'saMbhUtim upAsata upAsate'saMbhUtiM ye ye'saMbhUtimupAsate.



Here, it is clear that sandhi results in a loss of a-kAra, which reappears in appropriate places in the reverse order that is part of the ghanapATha. Therefore, there is clearly an avagraha in "ye'sambhUtim" and it is to be split only as ye + asaMbhUtim.



Note that in thecorresponding verse about avidyA and vidyA, the a-kAra in avidyAdoes not enter into sandhi with the preceding word. The saMhitA pATha is clear in itself as to what the pada-s are, without having to listen to pada and vikRti pAThas.



Overall, for a commentator who gives a lot of importance to the mUla textand draws meaning out of it,histask is made quite difficult when it comes to these three verses, in comparison to the three similar verses about avidyA and vidyA. In both cases, there isone verse talking of andha tamas and even greater andha tamas, a second verse saying that the ends attainedby upAsana of each are different (anyat) and a third versedescribing amRtyuM tIrtvA component and an amRtam aSnute component. However, in the case of saMbhUti and asaMbhUti, the third verse introduces the word vinASa, which is not seen in the two preceding verses. A commentator has two choices, keeping in mindthe context of the upanishat as a whole. He can ignore the fact that while one verse talks of saMbhUti-asambhUti and the next talks of saMbhava-asaMbhava, the third verse, on a literal reading,only mentions saMbhUti, says nothing about asaMbhUti (or asaMbhava) at all and suddenly brings in vinASa instead. Such an interpretation may be self-consistent and it may be consistent with the padapATha, but itwill nevertheless leave unexamined the connections linking the three verses in one set and the connections linking the two sets of three verses each.



Or he can, as SankarAcArya does, take tIrtvAsaMbhUtyA as containing a sa-varNa sandhi,interpret as per the word asaMbhUtyA and for consistency's sake, point out that there is a lost a-kAra in the opening pada of the verse. The word vinASa then stands in for saMbhUti because of the consideration that saMbhavaand vinASa are two sides of the same coin. Such an interpretation consciously and explicitly makes a departure from the pada-s as received, in the interest of making everything consistent within the general structure of the text and bringing out a self-consistent meaning in the commentary. As Sri Subrahmanian already mentioned, the concluding passage of the SAnkara bhAshya revisits the problem and proactively addresses a number of otherpossible questions that can be raised about his interpretation. I am not sure what to make of mahIdhara's applying a-lopa to the word vinASa instead of to saMbhUti. An examination of his commentary on all six verses in question would be necessary to understand his position well.



The only other way out, as I see it, is to leave saMbhUti alone in this verse, take vinASa as synonymous with asaMbhUti and attempt to interpret all three verses consistently. However, any such possible interpretation has to get around the conceptual problem raised by the fact that asaMbhUti, that which has no origin, will be equatedtovinASa, that which is mRtyu, and on top of it, an upAsana onsuch vinASais promised to lead one beyond mRtyu.Such apossible interpretation of the verse willalso have to be gauNa and can neverbe quite straightforward.



Incidentally, this bhAshya is one of the many reasons why I reject the currently accepted academic scholarly notion that a mention/influence of Yoga in a text is a reason to doubt its attribution to Sankara bhagavatpAda. Both the phala-s of prakRti-laya and aNimAdy aiSvarya mentioned in the SAnkara bhAshya point to a heavily Yoga laden context to the corresponding upAsana. Other than yogasUtra 1.19 on prakRtilaya, I can only think of the mahAnArAyaNopanishat sentence, tasya prakRtilInasya yaH paraH, as a primary textual citation. As for the aNimAdi siddhi-s, see SAnkara brahmasUtra bhAshya 1.3.33, where they are mentioned and yogasUtra 2.44 is cited with approval. One could argue that the ISopanishat itself says nothing about Yoga practice per se and that not all upAsananeed be particularlyYogic in nature. If so, it should also be granted that SankarAcArya, as an advaitavedAntin, has no particular reason to bring in Yoga here, unless he has interpreted these verses either according to a handed down tradition or as per his own personal experience of the correspondingupAsana or both sampradAya and svAnubhava.Whatever the case may be, a prominent place for Yoga is clearly there within Sankaran advaita. It is subordinated to AtmajnAna for sure, but it is not brushed aside as alien or inconsequential.
