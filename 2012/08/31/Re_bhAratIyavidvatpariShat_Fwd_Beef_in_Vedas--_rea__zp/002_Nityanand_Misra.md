I personally do not agree with Sh. Rajaram’s opinion. However, I have no idea what Sh. Ganesh is trying to convey below. Does he mean to say that there are a large number of takers for Sh. Rajaram’s opinion, for he uses the idiom “quite a few” which means “many” or “a fairly large number”? Or does he mean to say there are hardly any takers or no takers, as suggested by the verse used later. The message is obfuscating and is lost on me, he may want to clarify the same.  
  
Anyway, in my humble opinion, whether there are “quite a few”, “a few” or “few” takers for an opinion is irrelevant. The whole scientific world was a taker for Caloric Theory at a time, and there were hardly any takers for theories of Copernicus and Galileo in their time. Today, the inverse is true for all the above theories.
