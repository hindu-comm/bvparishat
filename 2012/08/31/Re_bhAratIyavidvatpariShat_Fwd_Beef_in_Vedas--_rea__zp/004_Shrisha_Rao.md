\> It can be argued that the very fact this injunction prohibiting beef-eating was incorporated as a sukta is evidence that the practice prevailed in those days. For example, there is no sukta that prohibits the eating of garbage.  
  

It is true that both विधि and निषेध relate to what is actually possible to do; neither prescription nor proscription applies in case of something that is not. Or else, we could say स हि शास्त्रस्य विषयो भवति यो अज्ञातो सन्दिग्धो विपर्यस्तो वा (VTVN टीका) -- that alone, which is \[otherwise\] unknown, controversial, or misunderstood, is a subject of a शास्त्र. The concept of अपूर्वता which is described as a लिङ्गं तात्पर्यनिर्णये could also be noted; there is no अपूर्वता in respect of things that are already known, and this in fact becomes a point of contention between varying interpretations of classical texts.  
  
That the practice of beef eating is old is beyond doubt; some people (e.g., D.N. Jha in "The Myth of the Holy Cow") cite Panini's दाशगोघ्नौ सम्प्रदाने (अष्टा. ३-४-७३) as evidence that beef-eating was approved by Panini. However the अष्टाध्यायी is not regarded as a धर्मशास्त्र, and does not in general prescribe or permit specific conduct. In this case, as elsewhere, it merely defines the norm of usage -- one for whom a cow is killed (such as a guest to whom beef is given) is also linguistically described, by सम्प्रदान, as a गोघ्न, cow-killer (just the same as the one who does the actual killing). The same principle of course is also well known in law and common usage, where a person who arranges for another to commit theft, murder, etc. (or accepts the gains from such an act of another), is also regarded as a thief, murderer, etc., and is culpable as one. Stating this principle does not imply assent to theft, murder, etc.  
  
Apte quotes Baudhayana as defining म्लेच्छ by  
  
गोमांसखादको यस्तु विरुद्धं बहुभाषते \|  
सर्वाचारविहीनश्च म्लेच्छ इत्यभिधीयते \|\|  
  
Yes, this also of course shows that there were such people even in Baudhayana's time, but it can hardly be understood that their conduct was approved of by him.  

  
\> I don't think it is an important issue. Many things were done in the past we should not do now. It is called progress.  
  
  

It is an important issue to the extent that some (e.g., the aforementioned Jha) mis-state or selectively state the textual evidence about beef. It is hardly progress to let such views go unchallenged.
