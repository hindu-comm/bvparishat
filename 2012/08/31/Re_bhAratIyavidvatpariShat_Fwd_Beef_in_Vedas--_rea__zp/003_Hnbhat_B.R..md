I agree with you in all respects. Now there is a group who believe that they only know the true meaning of Veda-s than our ancestors and commentators who were certainly earlier than to us and elevated in their insights as seers of Veda-s than us.

  

No body can go to the millenium in which the Veda-s were written if at all even accepting they are human creation and in the other way, as a Vedic Vijnan given by Brahma, himself, everybody can claim he is the real seer of the Vedic Vijnana taking advantage of this and according to his insight (दिव्यदृष्टि given by his guru) and give his own interpretation. I am seeing many such blogs and articles on the net.

  

This is my sincere opinion after reading many messages in the direction of revival of Vedic darshan or Vedic Vijnan.
