Dear Raajaram Sir,

You have precisely hit at the right point and often this is your way  
too:-) It is the least to say that am very happy with such a seasoned  
pertinence towards any thing and especially so with the issues that  
concern the scholars of Bhaarateeyavidyaa or Indic learning. But  
unfortunately am quite sure that takers or votaries at least, for this  
are quite a few here:-) Here I am reminded of one witty subhaaShita:

श्रोतारः सन्ति नो यत्र वक्ता तस्त् किं करिष्यति।  
नग्नक्षपणके दॆशॆ रजकः किं करिष्यति॥  
(Where none to listen, what is the fun for the speaker? How come a  
laundryman is placed in a nudist colony?)

Any way, your timely and pertinent writings inspire people like me.

With utmost regards

ganesh
