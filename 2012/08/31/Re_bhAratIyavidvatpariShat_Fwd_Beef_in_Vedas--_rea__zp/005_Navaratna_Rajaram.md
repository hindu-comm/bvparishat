 Good point. Panini cannot be taken as authority though he might have used an observed practice for illustrative purposes in his grammar-- to highlight a point in grammar or usage.



 Does Yaska have anything to sayon this. Anyway, I don't see it as a point of any great importance, just a curiosity. Appedal to authority is no logic.
