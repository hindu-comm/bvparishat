hariH OM,  
  
 The view that cow was sacrificed for a guest is erroneous due to the following reasons:  

1.  Beef is not mentioned in the dharmashastras as an ingredient in
    madhuparka (western translators have mis-translated this). 2.  The process of inviting a guest is continuous. The process consists
    of inviting him, giving him water to wash his feet, giving him water
    to sip, giving madhuparka etc. etc. There is no scope of waiting
    anywhere. AshvalAyana directs that in absence of honey, ghee may be
    used to mix with curd. This also seems to be a measure to prevent
    excessive waiting of the guest.  
3.  When the guest is at the door, the host asks him whether the cow may
    be gifted. If the guest is desirous of accepting, he may agree,
    else, he may pronounce the mantra "mAtA rudrANAM duhitA vasUnAM
    ...." and ask the cow to be let free.  
4.  The above being the case, the guest kept waiting for the whole
    duration while the cow is killed, a part of its flesh taken, cooked,
    and mixed with madhuparka is just unnaceptably illogical even for
    beef eaters. (but this is what the western translators and their
    brown-babu followers seem to think)  
5.  Killing a cow for two - three spoons of meat is just illogical and i
    don't think the shAstrakAras or the people were that foolish. 6.  There is no "popular" meat preparation (as attested to by popular
    chefs, pl see link given below) which is prepared with sugar. Seems
    that there is no taste compatibility between meat and sugar. So, to
    claim that beef was taken and mixed with raw curd, honey etc. is the
    height of bad logic. Atithi is nArAyaNa, hence to give him something
    that tastes bad when he is at our door (that too after making him
    wait for about 1/2 to 1 hr when the beef was being cooked) is
    (pardon the pun) in "bad taste".
