Respected Scholars , Namaskar!



Sanskrit word for harmonics



Many postings on this list about how to express mathematical fractions in Sanskrit. I have a question. How do you express first harmonic, second harmonic etc of fundamental frequency?. These are multiples of fundamental frequency , say f. Harmonics are 2f, 3f, 4f etc. Also I am looking for a Sanskrit expression for a standing wave in open and closedd tubes. Human vocal tract is a tube. Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
