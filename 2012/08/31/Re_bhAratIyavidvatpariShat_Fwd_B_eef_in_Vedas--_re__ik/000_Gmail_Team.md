Dear Navaratna Rajaram, I support your view. We have to give attention to present and present problems. Living in imaginary past of Vedic prestine age does not solve present dayproblem.One hasto accept the customs based upon scientific reasoning. Thanks for expressing your right views. N.R.Joshi

 It can be argued that the very fact this injunction prohibiting beef-eating was incorporated as a *sukta* is evidence that the practice prevailed in those days. For example, there is no *sukta* that prohibits the eating of garbage.



 I don't think it is an important issue. Many things were done in the past we should not do now. It is called progress.



 I question the practice of looking to the past to justify the present. Each question should be examined on its merit and answers found in the present context. Revivalism is not the answer.



 (I am a student of the Vedas, have written several books on them, but I am not at all sure that I truly understand the Vedic milieu or how they lived.)
