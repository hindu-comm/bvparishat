Absence can help in raising questions for which researchers should try to find answers, but a researcher should always remember that absence of mention does not absence of a thing/person.

  

A verse which makes BH a son of ;Sabara is quoted by Ganganath Jha in the introduction to one of his Miimaa.msaa work translations. In Raama-bhadra Diik.sita's Pata;njali-carita, BH is spoken of as the son of Candra-gupta. Such traditions should be accepted only when they are corroborated by other independent sources.

  

\>the distinctive poetic idiom which keeps the Bhattikavya away from the easy perceivable verses of the Vakyapadiya and the Satakas. I categorized the Bhattikavya in the group of Kirata and Naisadha according their poetic idiom, whereas the Vakyapadiya and the Sataka verses are of the draksapaka like that of Kalidasa, Dandin et al, rather than a nalikerapaka.\<

  

The Bha.t.ti-kaavya is written to illustrate grammatical forms (and the ala.mkaaras defined by the author's time). If you take out the not-so-familiar grammar derivates, it does not have a style difficult in the same way as that of Bhaa-ravi and ;Srii-har.sa. Its syntax, on the whole, is quite simple. Our judgment should not overlook the author's proclaimed objective.

  

  

\>The problem I felt with Bhartrhari is that his overlooking on the metre rules, as the yati (pause) is an approved criterion. In the Nitisataka, the verse numbers four and five in the pṛthvī metre which demands the first yati on after the eighth and second after ninth, where he overlooks the rule: jaso jasyalā vasugrahayatiśca pṛthvī guruḥ, as he says: na tu pratiniviṣtamūrkhajanacittamārādhayet. It is not good to have pauses like: na tu pratiniviṣtamū (8) and then rkhajanacittamārādhayet (9). He repeats the problem in: labheta sikatāsu tailamapi yatnataḥ pīḍayan as it gets: labheta sikatāsu tai (8), and followed by lamapi yatnataḥ pīḍayan (9) etc. Patanjali said: api māṣaṃ maṣaṃ kuryāc chandobhaṅgaṃ na kārayet.\<

  

Historically, the yati in p.rthvii metre is not absolutely fixed. I remember having read an article on the issue. If I succeed in getting an exact reference to the article, I will send it to you.

  

I know the sentenceapi māṣaṃ maṣaṃ kuryāc chandobhaṅgaṃ na kārayet. However, it must come from some text other than Pata;njali's Mahaabhaa.sya.
