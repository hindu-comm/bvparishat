The message originally went only to Dr. R. Ganesh. So, I am copying it here for the list/forum.

Whether the same of BhartRhari of Satakas wrote vaakyapadeeyaM or not  
is a billion dollar question. Me too know some thing about this.  
However, can any body give me any hint or clue to recent conclusive  
researches in this regard so that I will be greatly enriched.\<  
  
In historical research there is rarely any such thing as conclusive research. This is especially true of research bearing on Indian history, since so much material that could have helped us has vanished in the belly of time. The best we can do in addressing most historical issues is (a) to distinguish between subjective and objective evidence, between primary and secondary sources, and between definite, probable and possible implications of what we note, (b) not to come across as too sure of ourselves and (c) to state explicitly the areas of uncertainty and the areas yet to be studied.  
  
As I show in parts of the attached article, \*in the current state of research,\* it seems \*more probable than not\* that the ;Sataka-traya author Bhart.r-hari and the Vaakyapadiiya author BH are historically one person,  
  
(Please note the emphasis indicated by the star \* sign and the qualifications I have introduced at various points in the article. Also, please read the last page before you begin to read the article. The publisher did not send me the proof before the article was published. The practices and standard of Sanskrit-Pali-Prakrit research printing in India must improve.)  
  
The text of the ;Sataka-traya has more than one historical layer as D.D. Kosambi's research establishes. His is an objective demonstration. Its validity is not dependent upon his views on Indian history or his political views (I do not agree with several of them, but I rate him highly as a practitioner of textual criticism. We can try to go beyond him and we must hope that, one day, we will succeed in doing so.) What he put together as the oldest layer is the best starting point we have got.  
  
Secondly, we should avoid very general, obviously anaikaantika, arguments. A mere acknowledgement of brahman as the highest reality would not make the ;Sataka-traya author a Vedaantin in the sense ('willingness to argue for brahman as a matter of personal commitment') that we need to determine if this author is the same as the author of the Vaakyapadiiya.  
  
Even if commitment-oriented arguing were to be found in the ;Sataka-traya, which is not the case, it is always possible that the author could have changed his view over time.  
  
Nor is the Vaakyapadiiya author a Vedaantin in the sense ;Sa:nkara, Raamaanuja, Madhva, Vallabha or Nimbarka are Vedaantins. In fact, the word vedaanta does not even occur in his work (trayyanta occurs but it does not seem likely that it is an exact synonym of vedaanta in the Vaakyapadiiya as it may be in some later works).  
  
Any argument for author identity based on acceptance of or reference to brahman would be as wide as the argument -- if one were to be made -- that the author of the Abhij;naana-;saakuntala and the Uttara-raama-caritam must be identical, because in both works husbands are shown as affectionate toward their wives.

\> The kernel of the Śatakas is well inclined to the Vedantic doctrines, as the eradication of the karman through the real knowledge. The śāntaṃ tejaḥ of the Nītiśataka is tuned with \[= is in tune with?\] that of anādinidhanaṃ brahman of the Vākyapadīya. The dispute had been raised by Colebrooke & co. with a pretext that Baṭṭi and Bhatṛhari are the same \<  
  
Dear Shri Narayanan,  
  
I learn much from your contributions to the BVP forum, especially the ones you write in Sanskrit. I respect the service you render to the field in this way. Please continue to do so. However, the reasoning you offer in your specified post, as already indicated, is not proper.  
  
Additionally, are there really that many verses in the ;Sataka-traya that are concerned with "the eradication of karman through real knowledge"? Most of the first ;staka teaches worldly wisdom, which, if anything, can produce more binding karman. The second, devoted to ;s.r:ngaara, will not be useful, by its very nature, to get rid of karman. In the third, there certainly is the teaching of something, namely detachment, that will be instrumental toward eradicating certain karman, but how far is there any emphasis on eradication of karman itself?  
  
Secondly, in your last sentence, are you saying that Colebrooke took the ;Sataka-traya author and the VP author to be different because he wanted to prove that Bha.t.ti and BH were historically the same person? If so, what exactly is the logical relationship between the two theses? Which words indicate Colebrooke's motive?  
  
a.a.
