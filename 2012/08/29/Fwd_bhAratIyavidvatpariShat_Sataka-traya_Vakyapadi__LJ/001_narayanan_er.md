Respected Professor Aklujkar,

Thanks a lot for the compliments and still I am a humble student of Sanskrit try to convey to the best of my ability, but my reading in the versatile area of Sanskrit related information is too poor which I will try to improve myself as the years progress. Thank you very much again for attaching the pdf of your valuable article published in the Anusnadhan- Love or Leave : Bhartrhari's Dilemma. I will read it correct my mistakes in my understanding from the English Introduction by Kale who summarized the arguments of Pathak. It has also been written in the Introduction by K. M. Joglekar that Colebrooke wants to prove Bhatti and Bhartrhari are the same (Introduction. page.15). Among the eight conclusions listed out on the basis of cast, nativity, sect of worship etc., the Colebrooke argument is remaining isolated. Moreover, the verse (ratnani vai vararucir nava vikramasya) on navaratnas of King Vikrama court does not suggest Bhartrhari at all even by name. Joglekar sees that Telang accepts Sataka author and the Vakyapadiya author are same whole period is supposed to be 56-57 B.C. What I thought against Colebrooke's findings is the distinctive poetic idiom which keeps the Bhattikavya away from the easy perceivable verses of the Vakyapadiya and the Satakas. I categorized the Bhattikavya in the group of Kirata and Naisadha according their poetic idiom, whereas the Vakyapadiya and the Sataka verses are of the draksapaka like that of Kalidasa, Dandin et al, rather than a nalikerapaka. The problem I felt with Bhartrhari is that his overlooking on the metre rules, as the yati (pause) is an approved criterion. In the Nitisataka, the verse numbers four and five in the pṛthvī metre which demands the first yati on after the eighth and second after ninth, where he overlooks the rule: jaso jasyalā vasugrahayatiśca pṛthvī guruḥ, as he says: na tu pratiniviṣtamūrkhajanacittamārādhayet. It is not good to have pauses like: na tu pratiniviṣtamū (8) and then rkhajanacittamārādhayet (9). He repeats the problem in: labheta sikatāsu tailamapi yatnataḥ pīḍayan as it gets: labheta sikatāsu tai (8), and followed by lamapi yatnataḥ pīḍayan (9) etc. Patanjali said: api māṣaṃ maṣaṃ kuryāc chandobhaṅgaṃ na kārayet. Now I doubt that these verses of Sataka could have been before the yati rules of strict nature come into existence. Anyway, I apologize on criticizing Bhartrhari, by following the words of Anandavardhana: sūktisahasradyotitātmanāṃ mahātmanāṃ duṣṭadūṣaṇamātmano duṣṭadūṣaṇameva. 

I take this opportunity to thank Satavadhani Professor R Ganesh too for the question regarding Sataka and Vakyapadiya.  
Regards,  
Narayanan
