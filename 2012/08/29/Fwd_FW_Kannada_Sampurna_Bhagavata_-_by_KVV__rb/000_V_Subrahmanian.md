Pl find enclosed the details of the translation of Bhagavatam to Kannada. This indeed is a hercularean task and the author sri Varadaraja Iyengar already has to his credit the translation of the celebrated Bhajagovindam to Kannada. This has become very popular and was reprinted due to public demand twice in a year.



I request all of you t o kindly support this cause by booking your person al copy immediately and also help by spreading this information to your friends and relatives who may be interested.



Namaste
