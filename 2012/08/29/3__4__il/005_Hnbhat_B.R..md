A real question on the mathematical system of India.

  

त्रिपादूर्धमत्यतिष्ठद्दशांगुलम् -

  

where above three पाद-s, = quarters, does it mean it? त्रिपात् can be referring the three पाद-s of त्रिविक्रम or पुरुष, which again depends on ontological considerations.

  

संख्यासुपूर्वस्य॥ ५।४।१४० prescribes the लोप for the पाद, as द्वौ पादौ अस्य in बहुव्रीहि only. The group having three quarters पाद-s could be made to derive, 3/4 somehow as only four quarters are there for a single digit.

  

Whether this is used in the meaning in astronomical गणित texts, लीलावती is the question. For others, the question remains the same.

  

त्रिपत् - according to Amara’s usage, "पदङ्घ्रिश्चरणं युगम्" where it can be justified in isollated usage as archaic or there is a word पत् like हृद् both governed by Paninian rules independently.हृद् is substitute for हृदय and पद् for पाद under prescribed conditionsपादः पत्६।४।१३० andUnless otherwise, usage is attested with authoritative sources.

  

६. ३. ५० हृदयस्य हृद् लेखयत् अण्लासेषु ।

६. ३. ५१ वा शोकष्यञ्रोगेषु ।

पादस्य पदाऽज्यातिगौपहतेसु ६।३।५२

६. ३. ५३ पद् यति अतदर्थे ।

६. ३. ५४ हिमकाषिहतिषु च ।

  

Only the usage from the authentic sources in Indian Mathematics would solve the question.
