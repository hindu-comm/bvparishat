What about

  

*राजा षड्भागमादत्ते*सुकृताद्दुष्कृतादपि ॥ 10cd

धर्म्मागमो रक्षणाच्च पापमाप्नोत्यरक्षणात् ।  
  

which is the source of Kalidasa. Is it 1/6th or6/10 as suggested by

  

Anyhow, "अभिधानलक्षणाः कृत्तद्धितसमासाः" the समास-s are formed following the rules according to the meaning intended by the usage.

  

चतुर्थाणां पूरणः चतुर्थः -

means 1/4 if the group is presumed of 4. Other wise, चतुर्थो भागः only make the sense clear one fourth. Otherwise, it give the meaning ordinal number 4th corresponding to the order in the group and used as adjective. By itself doesn't mean 1/4th derived as पूरणप्रत्ययान्त as per

  

5-2-51 षट्कतिकतिपयचतुरां थुक्.

  

Now coming to the compound suggested, by Sri Nityananda,

  

त्रयाणां चतुर्थाणां समाहारः - 

  

  

  

will mean even if take it as 1/4 as substantive noun (without ordinal meaning of the number), the combined meaning would make it, 3 quarters. And in that case also, we have to supply or presume it is out of 4 and by itself won't convey the meaning 3/4th. i.e. 3 divided by 4 precisely
in English, and Sanskrit would make 3 x 1/4 = 3/4 mathematically. That makes the difference. In English also it holds the same position. समाहार should be taken as the meaning multiplied. Strictly, चतुर्थ is the ordinal number of चतुर्, which suggests the 4th member of any group.

  

It may be 4/5 but more than 4 minimum which can justify it the meaning a quarter. Only we can invent words, but real instances would confirm our propositions.
