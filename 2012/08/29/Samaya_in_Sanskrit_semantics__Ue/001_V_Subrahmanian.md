Sir,  
  
'samaya' also means a 'school'. For example Shankaracharya has used the word thus in the Brahmasutra bhashya: 'vidhikAnDe tarkasamaye vA' to mean: 'in the karmakANDa of the Veda or the tarka shAstra'.  
  
There is also the usage of the word in the 'srIlalitAsahasranAma' thus: "samayAchAratatparA' where it appears to be a particular practice/anushThAna like tantra.   
  
The word's special meaning in vyAkaraNam is not known to me and the others scholars will surely let you know.
