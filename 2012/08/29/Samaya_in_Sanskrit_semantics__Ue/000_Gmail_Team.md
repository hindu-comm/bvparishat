Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



First I would like to thank both Prof S. Korada and Dr. H.N. Bhat for discussing Dravyavaada with so many details. You both have put a lot of efforts and time in giving all those references. It will take some time for me to digest all that information. In the meantime I have a new question.



What is meant by 'Samaya'' in connection with Sanskrit shabdas and their meanings? Does samaya mean "Will of the God"" against Sanketa-convention of humans? As I understand 'Samaya' means time. What it has to do with meanings of Sanskrit shabdas? Is it new theory samaya vaada? Thanks.N.R.Joshi
