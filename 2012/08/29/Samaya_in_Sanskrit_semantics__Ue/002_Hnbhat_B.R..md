समयः शपथाचारसिद्धान्तेषु तथा धियः।

क्रियाकारे च निर्देशे संकेते कालभाषयोः॥

  

The above line from Medini lexicon shows thepolysemous usage of the word as recorded by lexicographers. The last one is related with the convention of time and language. Unit measurement of time and language, as I can understand. It can independently denote time and language in general.

  

साक्षात्संकेतितं योऽर्थमभिधत्ते स वाचकः  । । कारिका ७ । ।

  

समयः is synonym with संकेतः, which had already discussed as शक्ति-लक्षणान्यतरः संबन्धः.

  

Generally it conveys convention as in the परमार्षसूत्र -

  

सामयिकः शब्दादर्थप्रत्ययः । ७,२.२४॥ of काणाद.

  

It may be direct in the relation as वाचक or indirect as in लक्षणा. Or periphrastic and beyond the context, as in व्यञ्जना. Again, the each शास्त्र-s have their own convention, with fixed connotations, as already quoted by Mr.Subrahmanyam, समयाचारतत्परा - where समय seems to be the main stream, while वामाचार is off line procedure of worship, in Tantra. Or समय may have different connotation in तन्त्र literature. As for poetic convention, there are many things, which may or may not be found in real world, which are called कविसमय stereo typed descriptions, traditionally handed over. Like smile is white, anger is red, and अपमान as black. And so on in the descriptions. This is another type of convention. In Vaisheshika sUtra above, it is the convention of the language that gives the meaning.

  

As quoted in the Medini, the word समय may be used in different contexts with different connotations. For the semantic consideration, the वैशेषिक sUtra is enough explanatory with its commentaries.

  

संकेत is the same convention, as per the above lexicon cited and explained above from काव्यप्रकाश. It is called शक्ति in न्याय theory.

  

The above has relation with whether शब्द is नित्य or not, which is a topic of discussion for millenniums and each hold their view till now. It has already been discussed in the following topic raised by yourself:

  

<https://groups.google.com/d/topic/bvparishat/68uHoI_irh0/discussion>

  

Hope more can be expected from other scholars, especially from Prof. Korada, I am looking forward. Some of his views could be found in the above link to the topic already discussed.

  

> What is meant by 'Samaya'' in connection with Sanskrit shabdas and > their meanings? Does samaya mean "Will of the God"" against > Sanketa-convention of humans? 

  

The above two questions already have been discussed in the thread in the above link. To be precise, it is dependent on whether वेद-s are created by God or themselves eternal. The नैयायिक-s differ in it, and the मीमांसक-s accept them as eternal ones, not created by any and hence flawless. On the other hand, नैयायिक-s who accept ईश्वर as the creator of the universe and everything, who is सर्वज्ञ, created वेद-s and hence keep it aloof from any human made errors possible, even if accepted as created. The extension of itself, is इश्वरेच्छा शक्तिः, and every word has the convention established by ईश्वर.

  

While others take as इच्छामात्रं शक्तिः, again dwell on the convention of the language in which the meanings are customized by the users, which is already acceptable to a modern man. But note customized by usage, like I want to use the word "cat" to mean "rat" could not be accepted, unless you want to create a coded language like Panini. This is meant by इच्छामात्रं शक्तिः, which can cover even the technical terms used by Panini. For example, गुण would mean the vowels designated by the term by Panini, only in the context of Grammar and in general language, it won't give the meaning, अ, ए, ओ vowels. Such is the case of the maxim इच्छामात्रं शक्क्तिः.
