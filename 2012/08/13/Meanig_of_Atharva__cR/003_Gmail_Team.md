Dear Dr. Bhattacharya,



Thanks for reply. Few years ago I came across a student from Northwest Frontier province of Pakistan, His name was Atthar. So I asked meaning. He said it means fire.

For a researcher with open mind information from all sources is welcome. If you remember I wrote on BVP about opinions of Marathi scholar Rajawade on Panini grammar and views of Yudhisthira Mimamsaka.
By reading the books with opposite views one gets the idea about methods of different researchers. I realized now if I have to teach ancient Indian civilization with open mind, I will certainly have hard time to steer myself through different theories.

Thanks again. N.R.Joshi
