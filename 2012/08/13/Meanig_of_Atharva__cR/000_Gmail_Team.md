Atharva Veda is called AtharvaNa-ANgirasa Veda. As I understand these are names of ancient sages. Are their etymologies of these names?. Does the word 'Atharva' come from some root 'Tharva' or 'Thurva (to injure, to hurt-Apte dict). What is the meaning of Atharva in AtharvaShIrs'a? Thanks. N.R.Joshi
