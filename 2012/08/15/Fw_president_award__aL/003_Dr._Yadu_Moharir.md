Dear Prof. Aklujkar,  

  

Thank you trying to focus on the real purpose of this scholarly list.

  

Hope other scholars who are intimately familiar with the contributions of Dr. Karthikeyan, provide specific instances of real contributions and enrich our understanding.  

  

Best Rgds,

  

Dr Yadu

Of course, congratulations are due and I heartily join Dr. Karthikeyan in his generous gesture. However, I have a suggestion to make. Whenever such happy occasions arise, something about the honour recipients \*that would be useful to our field as a whole\* should be added by those who know them (even from a distance). The focus should be on what they have done in the area for which they are being honoured (publications -- research as well as in ;saastra or kaavya --, new contributions to teaching or administration etc.).
