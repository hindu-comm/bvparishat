Of course, congratulations are due and I heartily join Dr. Karthikeyan in his generous gesture. However, I have a suggestion to make. Whenever such happy occasions arise, something about the honour recipients \*that would be useful to our field as a whole\* should be added by those who know them (even from a distance). The focus should be on what they have done in the area for which they are being honoured (publications -- research as well as in ;saastra or kaavya --, new contributions to teaching or administration etc.). There is not much point in filling the list archives (if they exist) only with general words of joy, appreciation or abhinandana verses in Sanskrit. (although I enjoy them, too) Something that will inspire others or at least be useful to others in their Sa.msk.rta-sevaa should be specified.

  

I once again request the members of this forum not to reproduce entire messages/posts. Please reproduce only the part to which you are responding at the top of your message/post in angular brackets (or a similar device).
