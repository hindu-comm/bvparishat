The alternative अन्वय is quite possible. But the meaning itself is quite confusing. वरवरमुनि is addressed and again he is referred to in the first half as एष श्रीमान् :

  

एष श्रीमान् भगवान् ईश्वरत्वं विहाय आचार्यत्वं भजति,

  

and he is the related to the adjectival phrase:

  

मन्त्रं दाता, वरवरमनमुने मन्त्ररत्नं त्वदीय़ं

देवः श्रीमान् वरवरमुनिः - देशिकत्वे वर्तते।

  

मन्त्रं दाता वरवरमुने मन्त्ररत्नं त्वदीयं देवः श्रीमान् वरवरमुनिर्वर्तते देशिकत्वे।

  

वरवरमनमुने,हे मन्त्ररत्नं त्वदीय़ंमन्त्रं दाता,

देवः श्रीमान् वरवरमुनिर्वर्तते देशिकत्वे।

  

which makes a total confusion as raised by Desikan. AND without the context, gives rise to the following questions:

  

1\. Is the मन्त्र is belonging or praising वरवरमुनि or any मन्त्र preached to him?

2\. And, the giver of the मन्त्र is himself, वरवरमुनिः, who is the adjective त्वदीय़ं belong to.

3\. If identified, with वरवरमुनि himself, again,

he himself the giver and the मन्त्र belongs to some specific mantra, taught by him, the अन्वय again becomes complicated.

  

By proximity, मन्त्रं दाता seems to mean "the giver of the मन्त्र due to the operation of the rule "न लोकाव्यय --- "(२।३।६९) it takes accusative instead of षष्ठी. The relation of this phrase with the other parts is confusing. Though selected words excepted, generally words ending in र, are used in masculine gender, as per "रोपधः" with the exception of some like तन्त्र, यन्त्र, ... and नक्षत्र used in neuter and some in both. It could be included in अर्धर्चादि if needed to justify the usages found in neuter. Otherwise, it is used in masculine gender.

  

It comes to the original question or अन्वय again. Though the verse on the whole to identify वरवरमुनि as an incarnation of "देवः श्रीमान्" or ईश्वर of the Vedanta as न्य़ूनरूपक without ईश्वरत्व, i.e. सृष्टि,स्थिति, संहार etc. powers and एष श्रीमान् makes it अभेदरूपक. But the detailed anvaya, is creating confusion on the whole. Something may be missing in the verse, or confusing due to the alliteration, without the knowledge of the context or background of the composition of the biography of the so called वरवरमुनि which is a Sanskritized word too general to mention anything from the original name of the आचार्य praised.
