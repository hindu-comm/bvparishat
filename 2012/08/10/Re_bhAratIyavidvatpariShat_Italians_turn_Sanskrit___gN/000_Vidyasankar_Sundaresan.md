Training to chant for three hours? Must have been a real crash course! And why are selections from the Vedas titled as "Sanskrit study"? This kind of conflation of "Vedic chanting" with "Sanskrit study" should be resisted, at least on this group!



I can't helpspeak outabout this, butmy skepticalantennae go up when I see a news item like this pop up verbatim on multiple newspapers, magazines and websites. This press release has value to Indian journalists only because the people involved are Italians involved. And given the quality of fact-checking nowadays, I would venture to say that none of these Italiansactually lives in the Vatican.

Vidyasankar
