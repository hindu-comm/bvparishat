Scholars,

I fully agree with Sri Vidyasankar. Such news are very much exaggerated, perhaps for the sake of publicity of all involved. Similar thing on a much larger scale happened a few months ago, about a school which teaches Sanskrit in London.

  

I wish such publicity be given to some **Sanskrit Pathashalas** who are doing very good job for Indian students, but lack adequate funds.
