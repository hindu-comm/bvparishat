Namaskara,

  

I wish to raise this is partly because of the issues raised by Vid.Aditya BSA and Vid. Pandurangi as well as due to my own curiosity.

  

Are the young scholars of today capable of participating in traditional debates in large numbers?

While many of us participated in debates in school and maybe even college, very few scholars are available for traditional debates.

The organisations / mutts that try to orgainse such debates have very few options when it comes to invitingdebaters from different schools of indian thought.

The same set of scholars are seen in most such events.



Would it befeasible to launch a group specifically for debates among scholars?

Would it be of any good use? Would it help young scholars fine tune their skills to become better debaters?

While accepting there is a definite scope for bad blood and name calling and mud slinging and what not, I believe the only way out is to debate.

Debate not to resolve the issue, I accept that won't happen any time soon, but certainly as a learning exercise for youngscholars.

  

If an internet option is notviablea face to face option could certainly be worked out.

With the plethora of contests,quizzesand reality tv before us, we are not very far away from imagining a state wide,

may be even a nation wide debate between young scholars conducted on the lines of traditional indian debate.

  

I am voicing my opinion. I would like to hear everyone's views too.

With these if we are able to put together such a set of debates I am certain it would bring a lot of pleasure to all of us.

  

Namaskara

Purushothama

  

PS. Please put up info on such events that are already in place.
