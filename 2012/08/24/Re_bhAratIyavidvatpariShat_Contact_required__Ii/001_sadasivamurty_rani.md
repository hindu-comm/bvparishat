Dear Friend! Namaste!  
It gives me immense pleasure to learn about your interest in Natya Sastra. I am a Faculty member in the Rashtriya Sanskrit Vidyapeetha, Tirupati. There are so many students working under my guidance on the subject of Natya sastra for different purposes. A few of those pursuits I mention here:  
1. Nearly fifteen years ago a student from France Ms. Martinet studied entire Natya Sastra under my guidance.  
2. Mrs.. NA Laxmi, a famous Bharata Natya expert successfully completed her research work under my guidance entitled "A PICTORIAL AND DESCRIPTIVE GLOSSARY OF BHARA'S NATYA SASTRA : A STUDENTS' COMPANION"
This book has recently been published by Rashtirya Sanskrit Vidyapeetha, Tirupati.  
3. Mrs.N. Madhurima, Expert in Kuchipudi Classical Dance and the Founder of Tanmaya Dance Academy in Hyderabad, Deccan, India has been continuing her fruitful pursuits under my guidance on the subject "AUDIO-VISUAL DOCUMENTATION OF HISTRIONICS IN THE NATYA SASTRA".  
4. Prof. PRL Sharma, another expert in Kuchipudi Classical Dance and a professor has now associated with me for DOCUMENTATION OF BHARATA'S DRAMATIC ELEMENTS AS ADAPTED IN VARIOUS POPULAR CLASSICAL DANCE FORMS IN INDIA.  
5. Further as a close associate of many popular dancers in India I so far could write nearly 23 Dance Classical Dance Ballets in Sanskrit and also in our regional language.  
So if you are interested we both can meet through any possible means and I hope our interaction will yield some thing useful to the field of the Modern World of Dance and other related Theatrical Arts.  
Best Wishes,  

**Dr. Rani Sadasiva Murty**
