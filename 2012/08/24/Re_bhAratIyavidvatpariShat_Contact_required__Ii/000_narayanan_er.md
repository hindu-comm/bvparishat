Dear friend,  
You have rightly said that there are not much of the posting regarding arts and aesthetics in this forum. The discussions here are being dominated by the queries on the Sanskrit etymologies, astronomy and regarding various branches of the Indian system of metaphysics called the Vedānta etc. We hardly seen too many posts regarding the Indian schools of Mīmāmsā, Alaṅkāra, Sāṅkhya, Yoga, Nyāya, Vaiśeṣika, Vedic rituals etc. It is not because of the dearth of scholars or the scholarship in India, but many a number of established scholars are not trained to use the internet, and they are not accustomed to it. By the way, your innovation is deeply appreciable to post regarding the Nāṭyaśāstra and Indian aesthetics. I feel that there is nothing in being the western people or the northern people in dealing with arts and aesthetics. Sentiments and the emotional states are universal in all organisms, as Abhinavagupta says in his Abhinavabhāratī, commentary to the the Nāṭyaśāstra: "jāta eva jantur iyadbhiḥ samvidbhiḥ parīto bhavati" (by birth an organism is bound by the knowledge of sentiments and the emotional states). Whether you have to deal with the Nāṭyaśāstra and Indian aesthetics, the philosophy contemplated by Abhinavagupta et al, learning the fundamentals of Sanskrit and Prakrit are the must. Translations are not always been justified as the intentions of meanings are being lost in idiom of what which translated. As you know, the Nāṭyaśāstra is fundamental and fountain head of the Indian system of aesthetics, which is more of a dramaturgy supported with the systematics of dance and music. The notion of ancient social relationship of humans is revealed through it. The playhouse description, postures of dance, prerequisites of the play (10 types of the rūpakas), gestures of limbs, hands-eyes movements, sentiments and the emotional states, prosody and metrical patterns compatible to the sentiments which are to be revealed to the audience, speech quality in dialogue, Sanskrit and Prakrit (3 types in the rūpakas), representations of hero, heroine, clown etc., addressing according to social status of the characters, costumes, make-ups and implementing the rūpakas successfully etc. are elaborately discussed. But if you want to understand Bharata's and Abhinavagupta's language, you have to learn a bit of fundamentals in Sanskrit and Prakrit, for, the rūpakas are composed in these languages.  
Regards,  
Narayanan
