I have read several small and big plays and poems on Shivaji in  
Sanskrit. But I honestly feel that the great work of Late Sridhara  
Bhaskara Varnekar, The SivaraajyOdayaM epic is the best. Even his own  
play, Sivasya raayaabhiShEkaH is not up to this. Late Ambikaadatta  
Vyaas's writing is marvelous from the view point of language and  
diction. But Varnekar excels in many ways. Any way the se are the best  
writings on Sivaji in Sanskrit as I know..
