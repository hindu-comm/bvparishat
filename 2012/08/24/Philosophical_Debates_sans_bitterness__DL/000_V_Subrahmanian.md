In the recent years I have been witness to several decently conducted debates involving philosophical questions/concepts from texts authored by stalwarts of various systems of philosophy. Just yesterday I was at the Uttaradi Mutt venue where a debate was arranged by the Swamiji HH Sri Satyatmatirtha who heads this Mutt in Bangalore. The text taken up was the 'TarkatANDava' authored by the sawant of Dvaita Vedanta Sri Vyasa Tirtha. In the morning session Vidwan Devanathan, an expert in nyAya shAstra spoke on certain aspects of the 'vRttivAdaH' and this was followed by Dr.D.Prahladachar's short response to the earlier speaker.
In the afternoon there was a truly delectable treat in vAda style. The renowned pUrvamImAmsA (and advaita) scholar Dr Mani Dravid SastrinaH presented the aspects of the 'yoga-rUDhi' from the mimamsa school's perspective. And this was followed by a response from Vidwan Vidyasimha Mahuli from the Dvaita side in defending the objections raised by the former scholar.  
  
One could witness high levels of intellectual hair splitting interspersed with heavy doses of nyAya, vyakaraNa and other disciplines. The audience was looking with bated breath and'who will win' kind of expectation. The assembled onlookers were almost fully scholarly trained ones, even students. This very assembly was extremely impressive. To know that a tradition is doing all its best to preserve and increase the tribe of scholars is itself very soothing. It rained sweet Samskritam everywhere.  
  
I felt this kind of debate where no rancour, insinuation, name-calling etc. is a laudable way of conducting debates in a cordial ambience. If we can conduct discussions with such an attitude, taking care to maintain decorum and most importantly desist from igniting passion that will do good to all seekers of knowledge in this august forum. I am sure Shri Aditya was hinting at this kind of engagement with fellow members.  
  
I have witnessed such debates in other venues too, like for example the pUrNaprajna vidyApiITha, Bangalore where it would be discussions on Dvaita and Advaita and sometimes including VishiShTAdvaita scholars too.
