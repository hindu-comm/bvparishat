Dear Sri B.S.A. Aditya,  
  
Thanks for comments.My views were limited to the nature of the debate  
conducted at Bangalore.But some good points you have raised and I  
welcome your ideas.  
  
(You say, 'uncalled-for passion to win over the other side.' Please spare a  

moment to consider that, today, there is no gain to be had by winning over  
anyone through vedanta debates. This is not the age of gurukulas, richly  
patronizing kings, or reputations to safeguard. Things have changed today  

from the paradigm you provided.)  
  
The paradigm has not much changed over the centuries.If such debates  
were patronized by royal houses,now they are so by govts or corporate  
sectors.I did not speak of Vedanta debates.  
  
  
(When borders are merely political and everyone and their uncle has a  

relative in the States or Dubai, I think what needs to be won over is  
identity; not any other person's, but one's own. You may afford the luxury  
of being a true, committed tattva bubhutsu because the tattva has kept you  
that way, but it might appear completely different to someone who has seen  

an entirely different face of the tattva, one that is not so familiar.)  
  
Here you have used the Vedanta paradigm in saying that one's identity  
has to be won over.This is best done with cool contemplation and not  
by uncalled for passion.  
  
(The price you pay for the luxury of being a true, committed, tattva  

bubhutsu might well be the absence of people to follow the path you take,  
laid by someone before you. Maybe some people are beyond curiosity, and  
maybe others have the faith to walk blindfolded. I like to try to see where  
I'm going, primarily for my own sake, but also because I can help someone  

else if they're walking blindly into a ditch.)  
  
Everyone has to have his/her path.TattvabubhutsA will necessarily lead  
one there sooner or later.One may walk alone on that path or an entire  
caravan may join,it does not matter.  
  
(What is just vitanda for you is darshana for me.)  
  
In Indian logic 'vitanda' occurs when one has no committed position  
and the only objective is to find fault with the other.This is  
antithetical to darshana which is tattvajnana.It's arrived at through  
vaada - the healthy logical debate.  
  
Regards,  
  
SMMishra
