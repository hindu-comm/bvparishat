namAMsi pAr.sadebhyaH !  
Thanks SubrahmanyavaryAH for kindly illustrating how a debate was  
conducted in Bangalore.Verily vAda is called vItarAga-kathA in our  
tradition,it's also designated as guru-s'i.sya-vi.sayaH.Contrarily  
jalpa and vitaNDA are called vijIgi.su-kathA involving uncalled for  
passion to win over the other side.VAcaspati describes Ak.sapAda  
Gautama as dharma-vijnAna-vairAgyais'varya-s'Alin.That speaks a lot  
about how a devoted and committed tattva-bubhutsu should be like.It's  
a happy and fortunate coincidence that in our times also there are  
AcArya-s who conduct themselves in the best ways of the age-old noble  
tradition. vikAra-hetau sati vikriyante ye.sAM na cetAMsi ta eva  
dhIrAH !  
Best regards,  
SMMishra
