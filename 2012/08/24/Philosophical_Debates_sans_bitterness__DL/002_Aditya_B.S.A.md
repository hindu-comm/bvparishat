Sri Surendra,

You say, 'uncalled-for passion to win over the other side.' Please spare a moment to consider that, today, there is no gain to be had by winning over anyone through vedanta debates. This is not the age of gurukulas, richly patronizing kings, or reputations to safeguard. Things have changed today from the paradigm you provided.

When borders are merely political and everyone and their uncle has a relative in the States or Dubai, I think what needs to be won over is identity; not any other person's, but one's own. You may afford the luxury of being a true, committed tattva bubhutsu because the tattva has kept you that way, but it might appear completely different to someone who has seen an entirely different face of the tattva, one that is not so familiar.

The price you pay for the luxury of being a true, committed, tattva bubhutsu might well be the absence of people to follow the path you take, laid by someone before you. Maybe some people are beyond curiosity, and maybe others have the faith to walk blindfolded. I like to try to see where I'm going, primarily for my own sake, but also because I can help someone else if they're walking blindly into a ditch.

What is just vitanda for you is darshana for me.

Regards,

Aditya.
