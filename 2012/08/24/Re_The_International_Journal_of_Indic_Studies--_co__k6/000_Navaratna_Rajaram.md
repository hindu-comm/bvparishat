Dear Sir:



I very pleased to see you starting the IJIC devoted to the areas indicated in your announcement. I know that the MS University in Vadodara has an enviable record of scholarship and trust your journal will uphold it.



 I would suggest that you include **History and philosophy of science** as an area of interest. There is much that Vedanta can contribute tothe foundations of physics, especially quantum metaphysics.



 I am happy also see that your editorial board is made up of scholars and academics of distinction. I have been disappointed with the recent trends in organizations and even institutions under names like Vedic Studies, Indic Studies, etc that seem to be doing little beyond capitalizing on and even promoting private commercial interests while appealing to Hindu sentiments.



 Your publication on the other hand can uphold the highest standards of excellence.



Sith sincere regards,

N.S. Rajaram
