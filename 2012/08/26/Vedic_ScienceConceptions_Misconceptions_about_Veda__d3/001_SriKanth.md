Hi,

I read your post. I couldn't post my comment there as it is restricted  
to only blog members (?!).

Here is my comment:

Very nice to read this however this seems to be a view from 10,000ft  
high from ground. It is not clear and understandable.

Can you give some original reference, give atleast one example for  
these please:

// It is not in Samskruta Bhaasha, it’s in Brahmi Bhaasha. //

//A poet has written that Sita was not the wife of Rama, but the wife  
of Lakshamana!//

// There are solutions to thousands of problems due to which society  
is being suffered. //

// “this is like this; what’s use if it is like this; if it is like  
this, then it will become like this etc.,”//

Thanks,  
Srikanth.
