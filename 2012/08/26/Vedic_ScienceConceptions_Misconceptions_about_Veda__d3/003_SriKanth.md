Hi,  
  
I went through all the links given by you, with all due respect, there  
is no single practical example or detail that is useful.  
  
The question about reference on Sita being wife of Lakshmana is not  
there in the Indian Express news item. You need to give the exact book/  
author who has written such - not some news item about somebody who  
talked about somebody else - this is rumour not an authoritative  
reference.  
  
Most of the links are Puranic stories and are just throwing names. For  
example, in the article "What is there in Vedas", you had included  
Artha Shastra for Economics - is this the one written by Kautilya? Is  
it considered part of Vedas of what you claim to be written in Brahmi  
Bhasha?  
  
Thanks,  
Srikanth.
