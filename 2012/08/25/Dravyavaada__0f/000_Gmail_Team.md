Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



The author Prabhatchandra Chakravarti in his book,'The Linguistic Speculations of the Hindus' (Univ. of Calcutta, 1933) mentions 'Dravyavaada. But he does not explain it fully. Could scholars of this list throw more light on the subject of 'Dravyavaada' please? The word Dravya means wealth, The word Drava pathaartha means liquid (flow). Bhartrhari has given many synonyms for Dravya. Is Dravyavaada somehow related to meanings of Sanskrit words? or is it a mystic concept? Please enlighten us so that we grow in our knowledge with you. Thanks. N.R.Joshi
