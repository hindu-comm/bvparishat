Please note that there is not any binding that a word should denote only one meaning, in English नानार्थ is always possible in many words due etymology, and semantic considerations, specialization, restriction and extension.

(प-९; अकि-१,६.१२)

  

There is discussion on the nature of word power - as collectively by Nyaya School,

  

. "व्यक्त्याकृतिजातयस्तु पदार्थः" (न्यायसूत्र २.२.६९) is the Naiyayika's view. The discussion raises जातिपदार्थवादः, आकृतिपदार्थवादः, and व्यक्तिवादः separately, which is not accepted in general by the Naiyayika-s, who arrived at all the three combined form the meaning, or the thing meant . The two views above are referred to by Patanjali, in the above context, referring to the first Vartika, सिद्धे शब्दार्थसंबन्धे, and conludes both as acceptable to Panini, without much worrying about it. Here,

  

आकृतिः - is equated with जाति, this is called द्रव्यवादः। "आकृतिः = जातिः संस्थानं च" explains नागेशभट्ट्.

  

द्रव्यम् - व्यक्तिः - व्यक्तिः पदार्थः - is another view about पदार्थः. and this seems to be referred to द्रव्यवादः, as can be seen in the above extract. This is said to be discussed in detail by Vyadi in a lost work now संग्रह which is related whether the relation between the words and the things referred , शब्द and अर्थ - = पदार्थ as used in the above context, is Nitya or Anitya. पदस्य अर्थः - पदार्थः, the things meant by the words. The analysis if given by वैशेषिक school, द्रव्यगुणकर्मसामान्यविशेषसमवायाभावाः सप्त पदार्थाः । । which is accepted generally by all the other schools, with some modifications according to them. गुणाश्रयो द्रव्यम्।।" 7 महर्षि कणाद्, वैशेषिक टीका, न्यायकन्दली (६०० ई. पू.) is the exposition of Naiyayika-s. This is the meaning of द्रव्य in शास्त्र context and not wealth. Popularly known name is जातिवाद and व्यक्तिवाद discussed in Nyaya texts, and in the above context is discussed as द्रव्यः पदार्थः . If it is detailed in the lost work of व्याडि as such, the very information as such may not be available in its original form and hence the author might not have ventured to giving more information. What I have explained above is only based on the interpretation by the commentators, आकृतिः = जातिः, and द्रव्यम् - व्यक्तिः. But the two other views popularly known as जातिवादः and व्यक्तिवादः, the first accepted by मीमांसक-s and the later, is of doubtful source, as नैयायिक-s view is combined of the three as concluded in later writers on the topic - "जात्याकृतिविशिष्टा व्यक्तिरेव पदार्थः". The above is by Prof. Kunjunni Raja's explanation of the view of Grammarians in the "Indian Theories of Meaning" published by Adyar Library, 1969 p.70 which gives some more references from Helaraja, Bhartrihari etc. He ascribes the द्रव्याभिधान view to व्याडि and आकृत्यभिधान to वाजप्यायन.

  

More can be expected from other scholars Prof. Korada and others. Prof. Korada's view on जातिवाद is available in this topic in bvp:

  

<https://groups.google.com/d/topic/bvparishat/xqN4HWri4jI/discussion>

  

where the topic is discussed in detail.But the new for this topic is द्रव्यवाद and आकृतिवाद the popular names as आकृत्यभिधान and द्रव्याभिधान in महाभाष्य, perhaps much earlier than the न्याय, वैशेषिक मीमांसक theories of meaning, popularly known as जातिवाद and व्यक्तिवाद. As any available texts do not detail the nature of द्रव्यवाद, the author of the book you mentioned, might not have ventured to give any more information than available in Mahabhashya.

  

In this thread also it is discussed:

  

<https://groups.google.com/d/topic/bvparishat/yB00XvCI1ZY/discussion>

  

and continued in separate thread:

  

<https://groups.google.com/d/topic/bvparishat/Kl00cQRkPS0/discussion>

  

The topic even though available, divided into separate threads started independently makes it difficult to find them together.

  

Google search collected some of the discussion from our group in this search result:

Hope this will be helpful.
