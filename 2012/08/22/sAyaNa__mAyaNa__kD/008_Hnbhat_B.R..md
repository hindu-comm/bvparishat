What about लोल्लट, रुद्रट, उद्भ‍ट, उव्वट, etc.  
  
I am not sure of this exercise of trying wild guesses make the proper names look Sanskrit and clinging to their meaning literally than knowing about the works they have contributed to the literary heritage of Sanskrit. The contribution to Vedic Literature is considerably large whether he himself authored them or sponsored the composition as the royal authority (which is irrelevant so far as the contribution is considered).
