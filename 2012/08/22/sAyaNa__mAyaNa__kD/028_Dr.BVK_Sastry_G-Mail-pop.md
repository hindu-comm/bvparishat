Namaste Prof. Aklujkar



Thanks for repeating the assertions below to bring a focus and endorse a reason to revisit the study of ‘Vedas’ from the technicality of Pada (Word) and Artha ( Meaning and Purpose) model of Samskrut language perspective. This aspect of vedic vocabulary exploration in the frame of Vedanga tradition is an important issue to comprehend the significance of the debates and explanations in works like ‘Veda –Artha –Samgraha’ .

I am placing below Prof. Aklujkars observations side by side with the wisdom that has always been there in traditional texts, but sidelined by many .
