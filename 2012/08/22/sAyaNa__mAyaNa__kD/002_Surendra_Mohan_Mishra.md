Dear Mr Narayanan,  
Thanks for response.In fact it's about the great commentator and his  
father or clan name.My friend tells me that he got the meaning  
'kripAlu' or 'kind' from a google site which I have not  
verified.'SAyaNa' or 'MAyaNa' is a proper name no doubt,but the query  
is in respect of it's literal meaning and the language to which it  
belongs.Certainly it doesn't appear to be in Sanskrit.  
Regards,  
SMMishra
