Dear Prof. Aklujkar,

  

Thanks for the informative article. This I had guessed. The word Sanskrit is simply explained as having wealth, lord or ऐश्वर्य -

  

as per5-2-125 आलजाटचौ बहुभाषिणि । 5-2-126 स्वामिन्नैश्वर्ये ...  
which in modern Kannada, has taken seems to be taken the form ईश्वरस्य भावः - at the time of Panini himself. Either lord, having power or wealth literally. It counter part in Hindi is seen in सायी - साई - and could possibly borrowed into Kannada, also at the time of Vijayanagara empire, having taken the form सायी + अण्ण - सायण.

  

I think this may be possible. I looked for the derivation of साई in Hindi, online, but could not find any than all talking about साई बाबा.

  

In prakritization, म undergoes the change rarely, but it is not lost in any case. As its Kannada counterpart, in the spoken Kannada, it can be somi, saami, sovi etc. सायी is a rare transformation anyhow, according to Prakrit grammarians, than being taken as देशी word, but could not be traced to देशीनाममाला by Hemachandra. सामी would be normal Prakritized form.  
  
From "3-1-103 अर्यः स्वामिवैश्ययोः" is another possibility, which would turn out to be अय्य, in Dravidian languages, with the same meaning, as explained by Panini in the earlier paragraph.

  

But अय्य+अंण - is least probable source for सायण, which could again leave us one step behind. आयण is also least possible, as it would loose र्, and then take आ.

  

Anyhow, the article throws some light in the direction of etymology.  
  
With regards
