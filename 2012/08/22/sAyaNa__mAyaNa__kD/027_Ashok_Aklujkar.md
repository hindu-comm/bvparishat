I am repeating the general part of my last post below, because I consider it important and some may miss it because of the unintended incursion of the signature part of this forum. — a.a.

  

Many members of this forum need to note that Nirukta/nirukti/nirvacana is not exactly “etymology’”as the latter word is commonly used in Western/modern linguistics. Nirukta arises mainly from the bandhutaa way of thinking reflected in early Vedic literature, particularly the Braahma.nas. Because the Niruktakaaras observe the constraints of (synchronic) grammar (not necessarily Paa.ninian) to the extent they can, their derivations do occasionally turn out to be identical with or very similar to those of modern historically oriented linguists, but this is generally not the case and Nirukta does not have a historical dimension (which is a necessary starting point for modern etymology). Much devaluaing of Yaaska and his predecessors as well as successors has unjustifiably been done without noting this fundamental difference, and many u.naadi-type derivations have uncritically been accepted as reliable etymologies by certain scholars (particularly traditionally trained Indian scholars). The actual practice of Yaaska and other Niruktakaaras can be better captured through some such phrase as “context-sensitive grammatical derivation/corroboration” (I would welcome suggestions of less cumbersome equivalents).

  

Please note that I am not saying that one is necessarily less valuable than the other. A good researcher should take both into account in interpreting ancient (particularly Vedic) texts. There is much that Yaaska et al. knew that we no longer know (not all literature and traditional information has come down to us). At the same time, we should not base our understanding of history blindly on imagined or uncorroborated root words, especially the ones that do not conform to rules of sound change. We should be ready to celebrate difference and not promote the tendency ‘we too had X of Western/modern scholars.’

  

Sometimes both approaches achieve the same result through different but equally justifiable techniques; e.g., the explication of pa.n.dita or taarakita (as I have pointed out in my 2001 article:*"Pa∫∂ita* and pandits in history." In *The Pandit. Traditional Sanskrit Scholarship in India. Festschrift Parameshvara Aithal,* pp. 17-40. (ed) Michaels, Axel. New Delhi: Manohar. South Asian Studies series.
