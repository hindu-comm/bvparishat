Sorry.

  

I did not search for सांई which is given in Hindi Dictionary as derived from Sanskrit स्वामिन्. The meaning same, lord, मालिक which could be easily taken as सायी into Kannada, and सायी+अण्ण \> सायण्णण \> सायण which follows the article conveniently.

  

This could show some way, माता \> माई \> मायी+अण्ण - मायण. (?) which was the original question raised by Prof. Surendra Mohan Mishra.   

  

And then, like ट ending words,

  

कय्यटः, उव्वटः, जय्यटः, etc. which are out of the topic in this thread.

  

बिल्हणः, कल्हणः, are again of the same category,

  

Somehow they also could be traced back some combination of some Sanskrit Words, if one wants.

  

वर्णागमो वर्णविपर्ययश्च द्वौ चापरौ वर्णविकारनाशौ \|. धातोस्तथार्थतिशयेन योगस्तदुच्यते पंचविधं निरुक्तम् ।।

is the standard path of etymology paved by यास्क himself for Sanskrit and Vedic words which is open for other languages also back to Sanskrit.
