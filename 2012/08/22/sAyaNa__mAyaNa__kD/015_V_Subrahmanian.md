There is one Vidwan named 'Shingappa', a Kannadiga, I presume. He taught vyAkaraNa shAstram in Bangalore Govt.Sanskrit college and retired, settled in Mysore. He participates regularly at the annual vAkyArtha sadas at Sringeri. There is also a well known sculptor of the olden days of Karnataka: amara shilpi JakkaNAchArya.
