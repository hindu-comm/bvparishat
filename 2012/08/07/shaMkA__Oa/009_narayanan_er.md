Respected Professor Mishra,

Thanks a lot for corrections with elaborate notes. I am not at all an expert of anything and so that the corrections are always welcome. Hindi is rashtrabhasha to all of us as the doubt raised by one of our group friends in Hindi and I tried to reply to the best of my thought. I understand the problems of when one is not an expert in that language. I knew that the term corresponds "sound" in Hindi as "aawaaz" which is feminine gender, whereas sabda is masculine in Sanskrit. I used "darmiyaan" in the sense of the Sanskrit indeclinable "mithah" or "parasparam" or English "versus" etc. We get these types of terminology from the internet too and quite a few Hindi terms might be popular in Persian or Urdu too, and a few sites convey the proper genders of popular terms which avoid confusion. I am happy with the way you have corrected the notions of the aphorism naajjhalau has conveyed. My attempt for the replies that friend's questions were to attract the attention of scholars and further corrections, suggestions etc. are expected from the eminent scholars like you.

Regards,

Narayanan
