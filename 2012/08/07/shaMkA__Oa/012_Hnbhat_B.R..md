महोदय,  
दूसरी शंका में मुझे कृत्रिममणिं के संधि विच्छेद में संदेह है इसका संधि विच्छेद कृत्रिमं अणिम होगा या कृत्रिम मणिम होगा?

Do you know Sanskrit or not? If you know the meaning, please specify what do you mean? and see the case endings are correct.

  

कृत्रिमं अणिम - could not be correct. The correct writing with correct grammar would be कृत्रिमम् + अणिम. But it would not give the meaning you want, making the artificial crystal. Since it is called मणि and not अणिम. अणिमन् is a word, but it is used in masculine gender, as अणिमा*महिमा चैव गरिमा*लधिमा तथा। प्राप्ति: प्राकाम्यमींशित्वं चाष्टसिद्धय:।।.

  

कृत्रिम मणिम - could not be the correct word. There is no grammar in the splitting. So Both are wrong.

  

Both tried to give the correct splitting for the sentence you wanted in Sanskrit with correct grammar, which you could not understand. If you consider your splitting is right, please explain.

  

I have replied to your question "yes or no" *होगा या नहीं.*So no it is your turn, to think your splitting is correct or you have to understand the correct splitting.

  

कृत्रिमम् + मणिम्+ कारयन्ति - to give the meaning you wanted according to grammar. Otherwise, please give the reasons for thinking your splitting is correct. The above sequence is split version of the sentence, which would be like this:

  

कृत्रिमममणिं कारयन्ति and not as you have written in isolation. Even without, कारयन्ति, it would give,

  

कृत्रिमम् + मणिम् - and not कृत्रिमम् + मणिम

  

If you know Sanskrit or English, this would make sense. Otherwise would not any meaning or understanding. I am not trying Hindi, as I do not want undue criticism on my Hindi as a non-Hindi speaker. Someone would convey the idea. Only I used one word for not as both of the two alternatives are not correct orthographically or grammatically in the sentence used to convey the meaning you suggested.

  

Excuse me for writing little harsh in English and not using Sanskrit or Hindi for sake of clarity
