Sorry for the spelling mistake. Please read the above highlighted portion as :

  

कृत्रिम-मणिं कारयन्ति. If this is what you mean by sandhiviccheda, by hyphenation in the sentence, yes.  It will be like in Hindi lengthy words or English selected compound words. But it is not within the grammar of Sanskrit. But in समास the words to be written in Sanskrit using Devanagari are written without space if you mean viccheda by giving space between them.

  

This is what I understood from your question on a second thought, for your use of सन्धि विच्छेद. as you read it कृत्रिम-मणिम् if it is written in Hindi and you didn't want to know the rules of Sandhi as per Sanskrit Grammar.
