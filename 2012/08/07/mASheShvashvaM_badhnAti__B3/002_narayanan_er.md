Respected Sir,

To the best of my very limited sense I feel that the logic you have put can hardly work here. In the rule सप्तम्यधिकरणे च (2-3-36) it is exemplified with: दूरान्तिकार्थेभ्यः खल्वपि दूरे ग्रामस्य। अन्तिके ग्रामस्य। अभ्याशे ग्रामस्य। etc. all terms like dūra (far), antika (near), abhyāśa (near) are separately having their locative singulars leave no scope of ambiguity. In the case of māṣeṣu, the meaning of the locative plural is only interpreted as: far away from the fabaceae. The indeclinable ārāt (quibble of far and near) should be taken sensibly and logically suitable to the varying contexts of both meanings of far and near. When we follow the rule सप्तम्यधिकरणे च (2-3-36) and apply दूरे ग्रामस्य it does not indicate something near to the village, even the case ending of the term dūra in locative singular. Exceedingly, अन्तिके ग्रामस्य should mean near to the village rather than far off. Then the question is: why māṣeṣu in locative? If one has an utmost desire to keep the horse away from eating the unfavourable as the animal is stretching hard on the fabaceae field, then how the locative case to māṣa is justified. The rule: अन्याऽरादितरर्तेदिक्शब्दाञ्चूत्तरपदाजाहियुक्ते (2.3.29) overlooks the Genetive Case to have an Ablative Case when you apply the indeclinable ārāt (quibble of far and near), as for instance, आराद् देवदत्तात्। आराद् यज्ञदत्तात्। etc. and there it suits to the situation. The more suitable logic should have been like this: अश्वभक्षणोपजायमानमाषसस्यनाशभयादश्वं दूरात् बध्नाति, पुरुषकर्तृकाश्ववारणक्रियायाः ईप्सिततमत्वादश्वस्य कर्मत्वमिति। Still it is not clear to me. Hope more explanations from the eminent scholars.

Regards,

Narayanan
