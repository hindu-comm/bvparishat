If you had looked for the word निष्यन्दिन् or निस्यन्दिन् you should have been able to fine in the dictionary. You have to look for the stem in dictionary and not the inflected word.

  

अनुविपर्यभिनिभ्यः स्यन्दतेरप्राणिषु८।३।७२\|

  

It is because of this rule, both नि-स्यन्द्, or निष्यन्द् are possible for the root form prefixed with those listed in the above rule which makes it possible to have these optionally interchangeable forms.

  

You can seen the forms:

  

in the pdf page in the link:

  

<http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/cgi-bin/monier/serveimg.pl?file=/scans/MWScan/MWScanjpg/mw0564-nisarga.jpg>

  

The above is from Monier Wiliam's Dictionary, where you can locate it in the page. This is the entry from Apte's Dictionary:

  

1.[निस्यन्दिन् nisyandin](http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.3:1:2349.apte): (page[933](http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/contextualize.pl?p.3.apte.1445603))

2.[निस्यन्दिन् nisyandin](http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.3:1:2349.apte): (page[933](http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/contextualize.pl?p.3.apte.1445662))

> मदनिस्यन्दरेखयोः 1.57; Me.44.-4 Necessary consequence or result.-5 > Uttering, declaring. >
> निस्यन्दिन् nisyandin**निस्यन्दिन्***a.*1 Trickling or flowing down, > oozing.-2 Dropping or pouring down; कनकरसनिस्यन्दी सानुमाना- लोक्यते > Ś.7.

which gives only निस्यन्दिन् though both are possible.

  

The rest Prof.Narayanan has explained the grammatical derivation and the meaning in detail in another independent message.
