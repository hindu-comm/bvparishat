Normally Rig Veda references made to Mandal, Sookt, Mantra contain only
three numbers. They can also refer to the other system of Rig ved mantra identification based on Ashtak, Adhyaay and varg. These also refer to three numbers.



You are referring to Rg samhita 1.22.164.22.

I. could be taken as mandal or ashtak

22.can be taken as sookt only because there are only 8 ashtaks

164 could not match because there are only 22 mantras in Madal1.sookt 22.

thus I am not able to find any mantra that will correspond to your address.
