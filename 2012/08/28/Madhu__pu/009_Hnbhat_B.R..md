Dear Swamiji,

  

I have not interfered in this discussion.

  

As I have often repeated in my several posts in different topics, only dictionary meaning is not the conclusive factor of meaning in all the contexts. Especially, in Vedic Literature, it is the maxim of Yaska, as

  

नैकपदानि निर्ब्रूयात् i.e.

  

any word should not be explained in isolation, out of its context. Surendramoran and Subrahmanyam have pointed out to the similar contexts, where मधु could be interpreted as the कर्मफल.

  

In other words, you need not look for the same meaning in other context which would not be justifiable. Even Yaska, gives the etymology supported by the relevant ऋक् and ब्राह्मण for his derivation. It is not simple derivation here, but it is the explanation for the word मध्वद - मधु अत्तीति मध्वद, bu context as it refers to philosophical discussion, it naturally points out to the individual self as in the other cases. Only according to that you have to derive the word if you want and otherwise can be satisfied with the interpretation of the word, than looking into the dictionaries, which doesn't convey all the contexts where मधु is used. It is only in the word मध्वद which would literally mean the one enjoying the honey, which has no meaning in the context of philosophical context and which baffled you with the dictionary meaning like any student of Sanskrit Language would be.

  

Now what other commentator have interpreted the word मध्वद would differ to their tenets of the school they follow and has nothing to do with understanding the interpretation given by शङ्कर according to अद्वैत. Instead it would worsen the confusion already created with dictionary meaning, added with the interpretations according to the different schools other than Shankara.

  

Now finally, you asked for the word मधु as taken for honey, while the real word is मध्वद and the question is out of place according to Yaska also. In addition, there are many other factors that count for the meaning of a word in Sanskrit, than the dictionary meaning.

  

शक्तिग्रहं व्याकरणोपमानकोशाप्तवाक्याद् व्यवहारतश्च।

वाक्यस्य शेषाद् विवृतेर्वदन्ति सांनिध्यतः सिद्धपदस्य सिद्धाः॥

  

The above is general sources for deciding the meaning, out of which व्याकरण and कोश are only two, while major portion is shared by व्यवहार and the context, including the commentaries. Even in the case of नानार्थ words, the context will be decisive factors along with some more factors, totally numbering 17. Further, especially for the Vedic scripture, the maxim for concluding the purport, the factors are as follows:

  

उपक्रमोपसंहारौ अभ्यासोऽपूर्वता फलम् । अर्थवादोपपत्ती च लिङ्गं तात्पर्यनिर्णये ॥

  

which is generally followed in commenting उपनिषत् literature also. Different आचार्य-s may differ in their opinion, is another thing. It is not a general phenomenon, otherwise, there would have been hundreds of Vedanta- schools each commenting differently. But only we have only few like श्रीरामानुज and मध्व and not innumerable.

  

This is my humble opinion.
