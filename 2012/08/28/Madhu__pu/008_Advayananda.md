Respected Sri Surendramohanji and other scholars,  

Hari Om! Salutations.  
  

Thank you very much for your inputs on the derivation of the word 'madhu' as well as how the word can come to mean karmaphala with reference to the honey bee. I find great value in your explanation.

  

1\. Where else do we find the word madhu used in the context of karmaphala? I have not come across this meaning for madhu elsewhere. My knowledge of the Vedic literature in indeed minimal.

2\. How have the Vedānta Ācāryas (other than Śrī Śaṅkara) interpreted this word?

  

I am thankful to all in the forum who have given me inputs.

  

In Shri Guru Smriti,  
Advayananda
