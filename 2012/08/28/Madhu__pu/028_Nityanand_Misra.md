Dear Sh. Subrahmanian  
  
Thanks you for your email. I will follow up with you separately. Dr. H N Bhat has already mentioned 3-1-31 and listed the alternate forms possible from applying 3-1-31. Still I would like to speak to the scholar some time in future to get his perspective and also to speak on other common interests. As I am in Hong Kong, I will probably make the call the next time I am in India.  
  
Thanks, Nityanand
