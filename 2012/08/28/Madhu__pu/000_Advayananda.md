Respected Scholars,  

Hari Om! Salutations.  
  

The term 'madhu' has been interpreted by Śrī Śaṅkarācārya as karmaphala. The usual Sanskrit dictionaries do not give this meaning for 'madhu'. I kindly request for clarity with regards to this interpretation. The reference is to verse of the Kathopaniṣad, 2.1.5: ya imaṁ madvadaṁ veda …

I am aware that Ṛg Samhita 1.22.134.22 also has a reference to madhu as karmaphala. Shall be grateful if the Ṛg verse can be quoted in its original. I do not have access to that.

  

In Shri Guru Smriti,  
Advayananda
