Sir,

'madhu' word and its use with about 100 adjectives occures in Vedas in nealy 1000 places.

I am afraid your reference to madhu in rigvedas Ṛg Samhita 1.22.134.22 is not omplete.

There is no madhu in Rg samhita sookt 1.22 and 1.134.

However following note on madhu vidya from Aurobindo Ashram may be considered for the present

Madhu Vidya or the Doctrine of Delight

The Madhu vidya or the doctrine of mystic honey is found in the 5th chapter of the second book of the Bŗhadāraņyaka Upanishad which is itself part of the Shatapatha Brāhmaņa. Often this Upanishad is quoted by some monists to demonstrate this world to be an, “utter illusion” and that world is irrelevant to the attainment of the highest spiritual experience called as *nirguņa brahman.* Such passages upholding the, “lofty illusionism” are found in the *maitreyi brāhmaņa* of the same Upanishad which precedes the Madhu Vidya chapter. Madhu Vidya provides the required corrective and teaches us that the, “diversity in creation is the manifestation of a secret delight, that all things, however heterogeneous and warring they may appear, are held together by a secret harmony effected in them by the hidden creative self delight of the supreme who is the effulgent self, immortal”. The Upanishad states, “This earth is honey for all beings and all beings are honey for this earth- and he who is in this earth the effulgent, immortal *puruşha* and he who is within one's being, in the body, the effulgent, immortal *puruşha* are indeed the same. He who is this self, this immortal, this *brahman,* this all”. It gives fourteen illustrations to reinforce the above statement. It further adds that, “this self does not merely represent the basic principle of *madhu,* the bliss that abides in the heart of things but he is the master of all things and beings and holds together all beings, all Gods, all worlds, all selves and all lives”. Next the Upanishad quotes three verses of the Rigveda Samhitā (1.116.2, 1.117.2, 6.47.18) stating that the doctrine of mystic honey given here is not new, but was already revealed to the sages of the Rigveda*,* specifically *dadhyan* *atharvan* by Ashvins, the twin powers. Sri Sāyaņāchārya explains these verses by using a legend in the Shatapatha Brāhmaņa involving the God Indra, Dadhyan, son of *Atharvan,* and the twin powers Ashvins. Sri Kapāli Sāstry explains that these verses make much more sense if they are interpreted along esoteric lines, using the clues supplied by the meanings of names of personages like Dadhyan Atharvan. The two parts of the word Dadhyan, *dadhi* and *anc*, gives us the meaning that, “it is a distinct lustrous power moving in the yield of Light fixed in the intellectual mind”. Dadhyan, like the Atharvan or the Angirasa, is either a deified sage or humanized God. Ashvins are an inseparable dual Godhead who always appears together. The Ashvins embody the twin forces of harmony and beauty, health and joy. Their own archetypical interdependence and harmony in the cosmic functioning brings to bear on us the necessity of realizing the interdependence of things and beings, the balance and harmony that is preserved by a great unifying principle referred to as the *madhu.* It is the delight of being in all existence which explains and unfolds the necessity of diverse forms in the manifest existence and gives them their value. The particular chapter in the Upanishad closes with the following *Rig Vedic* verse due to the sage Bhāradwāja RV (6.47.18), “To every form he has remained the counter form: that is his form for us to face and see. Indra by his creative conscious powers (*māya* powers) moves on endowed with many forms; for yoked adore his thousand steeds”. The purport is that just as we can make various objects having different shapes by pouring the sugary syrup into various moulds, all the different aspects of manifestation are made from the vital force and the moulds which are represented by Indra himself.

*Madhu* is interpreted by Shankara as the principle of mutual aid. The beginning line, “This earth is like *madhu* honey to all beings and all beings are like honey to this earth”, is interpreted as follows by Shankara. “Honey is like effect; just as a beehive is made by a great many bees, so this earth is made by all beings. Thus all beings are the honey or effect of this earth.”
