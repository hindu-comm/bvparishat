Dear Prof. Korada and other scholars,

  

I had been following this this topic closely and was aware of the point raised by Mr. Nityananda and Subrahmanyam also in this respect, which are far from touching the point raised. I was expecting Prof.Korada to touch the point in any possible way to defend accepting the interpretation of Kahika, of the sUtra "गुप्तिज्किद्भ्यः सन्" modifying or limiting its scope to निन्दा, which is not present in the महाभाष्य as Prof. Korada suggested.

  

Now, coming to the point raised by Mr. Nityananda, with his detailed procedure of derivation of the different roots of गुप् to highlight his point, I can say it can be easily understood by any student of Grammar as customized by grammarians from the authors of Jayadithya and Vamana and the commentators on Kahsika, Mahabhashya and finally we are taught by Bhattoji Dikshita and followers. I grasped it from the very beginning when first raised by Mr.Nityananda and did not think of any satisfactory way to defend his interpretation on the usage in Katha Bhashya, as गोपायितुमिच्छति considering all the possibilities raised by him in the first post itself. Hence I didn't interfere in the discussion which was far away from any solution to the problem or defending the interpretation of shankara.

  

Having said these, I would like offer some considerations beyond Grammar. First let me present my understanding of the problem:

  

1\. It is clear that Shankara took the interpretation of गुपू रक्षणे for his explanation of the form as the suffix "समानकर्तृकादिच्छायां वा" which makes the सन् optional variable with the sentence. It is clear from his interpretation itself:

  

विशेषेण गोपायितुम् इच्छति - which is a तुमुन् affixed to गुप् for which आय is added. The alternative form would be गोपितुम्, गोप्तुम् as both are possible and only one optional form used by Shankara, to make it clear that it is the same root he is taking and not the other one which doesn't have the meaning रक्षण.

  

Now as a rule, it would take the सन् suffix as per समानकर्तृकादिच्छायां वा and would yield the forms as we know, as given by माधवाचार्य, according to whom, it is not अनुदात्तेत्, but उदात्तेत् and would take the forms - with the suffix सन् only in the परस्मैपद. so we expect

  

जुगोपायिषति, - with आय,

  

without आय, as per "आयादय आर्धधातुके वा"

  

जुगोपिषति - जुगुपिषति or जुगुप्सति in the case of the absence of आय and with or without इट्.

The first is with इट् and the second without इट् as it is variable as per

"स्वरति-सूति-सूयति-धूञ्-ऊदितो वा । । PS_७,२.४४\|"



I am not going produce the whole प्रक्रिया for सन् in each case, but only point out the difference in the final form. In the first, it takes as usual the लघूपधगुण and in the second, the सन् without इट्, becomes कित् as per "हलन्ताच्च॥ १।२।१०" and gets the firnal form जुगुप्स् with the same प्रक्रिया without लघूपधगुण. So we can get जुगुप्सति।

  

Now the question comes narrower, whether this गुपू is उदात्तेत् or स्वरितेत् as we see both usages as presented in different texts. It is only उदात्तेत् according to Madhava. If we take स्वरितेत्, we get both forms गोपायति or गोपायते. Of course, it can be गोप इवाचरति, which would take गोपायति, and शत्रन्त of the same, or this one with आय in the चतुर्थी - गोपायते। All the cases should be checked. If it is the same in meaning, as verbal form, गोपायते - रक्षति, as गोपायति, then the question is solved, as per the धातुपाठ he could have स्वरितेत् and उभयपदी. and in which case, "पूर्ववत् सनः" will give आत्मनेपद also and make the form विजुगुप्सते. This is just proposition based on the interpretation of shankara as given in the quoted lines. Now it would give the meaning as intended by him and also from the same root he had intended by saying "गोपायितुमिच्छति". All the धातुपाठ-s available to him would have been consulted by माधव as available to him. The other way would be to explain, गोपायते as अगोपः गोपो भवति - with क्यङ् as per
सूत्रम्. भृशादिभ्यो भुव्यच्वेर्लोपश्च हलः(॥ ३।१।१२) cannot be ruled out. This is a possible way of defending his interpretation following his own way and not conclusive opinion.

  

He might have followed any earlier interpretatin in the commentaries available to him which justify them with some other grammar than that of Panini or himself followed some other धातुपाठ. Both are possible things. Conisidering his date about the last half of 8th century, he could have followed some other commentary than Kashika, which could not have gained populatity at his time, composed in 7th century, only 100 years before shankara.

  

I think the above has precisely answered the question of Sri Nityananda -

  

My argument is that it cannot be generated from गुपू under Paninian system as I show below.

  

to which I can add, as we know from the interpretations, available to us as customized up to Bhattoji and Nagesha. Hence we cannot adjudge the possibility suggested by me, at shankara's time and the interpretations available to him. I have narrowed the scope of the problem to only to जुगुप्सति ow वि-जुगुप्सति could not be accepted, as we have only उदात्तेत्. If it is स्वरितेत्, it could well be accepted without any doubt we have expressed.

  

Now, to the question,

  

  

Assuming it does get the suffix, is the form जुगुप्सते possible from the root गुपू रक्षणे + आय + सन्?

If yes, what is the प्रक्रिया for the same?

  

if I remember, correctly, raised by Nityananda, as it is optional before any आर्धधातुक suffix, and without आय, the form with सन् is already shown above, following the explanation of माधवाचार्य, both जुगुपिषति and जुगुप्सति are already available therein.

  

For the other variation of meaning with different suffixes, for विजुगुप्सा depending on the context as suggested by Prof. Korada, I can add some more examples from the same सूत्र. But it is out of the scope of the discussion, as now the focus has narrowed.

  

  

In addition, to the one already given by Nityananda, in his tabular statement, the complete list of forms with सन् from the same गुपू रक्षणे as a परस्मैपदिन् verb are consolidated here as given by T R Krishnamacharya, which includes the ones I had shown above following माधव-s धातुवृत्ति -

  

जुगोपायिषति, जुगुपिषति, जुगोपिषति, जुगुप्सति. The derivational process are already given for the others by Sri Nityananda. and I have given only the प्रक्रिया for the form in question, with a simple solution that the verb could also have been used as आत्मनेपद as some usages are cited in some of the posts. The other way is to resort to the common solution, he might have been referring to some other Vyakarana, and accepting this, it may not be necessary in this case as Sankara has not violated the गुप्तिज्किद्भ्यः सन् rule any how.

  

Typo errors and omissions are to be excepted. Thanks for all those who contributed their view to this thread.
