Qn. There is a verse fraction called सन्नन्तान्न सनिष्यते etc. If then how the second optional सन् is justified in जुगुप्सिषते?  
qn. How the स्वार्थे सन् (3.1.5) is blocked to the other group गुप्-s of divadi, curadi and even for a partially गुप् of गुपू रक्षणे in the same bhvādi?

Dear Narayanan,

That *jugupsā* means ‘detesting’ is a convention authorized by the vārttika *guper nindāyām*. So this is svārthe san. What is the objection to san here?

A convention is a received tradition. One cannot make a general rule out of it and force the same in analogous cases. Hence one has to take √jugupsa- as a readymade dhātu only formally derived by adding *san* to *gup* irrespective of class. Moreover, to whichever *gup* do you add *san* the resultant √*jugupsa* will yield the same sense. How to know which *gup* is at the base?

A note. I wrote from common sense. If any colleague is aware of any available śāstric discussion I shall be glad to know that.

Best
