Om  
  
We have this famous mantra:  
  
  

ऊँ मधु वाता ऋतायते मधु क्षरन्ति सिन्धवः। माध्वीर्नस्सन्त्वोषधीः। मधुनक्तमुतोषसि मधुमत्पार्थिवँ रजः। मधु द्यौरस्तु नः पिता। मधुमान्नो वनस्पतिर्मधुमाँ अस्तु सूर्यः। माध्वीर्गावो भवन्तु नः ॥ ऊँ शान्तिः शान्तिः शान्तिः ॥८॥  
  
We can notice that the entire nature is spoken of as being sweet, madhu. This prayer, a wish, by the sadhaka/devotee is for having a trouble-free but happiness-filled life. The word 'bhavantu', 'astu' show this. The forces of nature can be terrible too, like tsunami, hurricane, floods, अतिवृष्टि/अनावृष्टि, unfavourable parents, sun-stroke, heat waves, cold waves, etc. and bring devastation in life.  
  
Man naturally longs for sukha and abhors duhkha - सुखं मे भूयात्, दुःखं मे मा भूत् . Yet, as the famous saying goes:  
पुण्यस्य फलमिच्छन्ति पुण्यं नेच्छन्ति मानवाः । न पापफलमिच्छन्ति पापं कुर्वन्ति यत्नतः \|\| the fruits of karma can be unpredictable, depending on the inputs that have gone in while the karma is performed.
But even while indulging in an unrighteous act, man longs to get some pleasant result out of it; otherwise he would not indulge in it. So, at the doing level the expectation is only happiness/sukha. This is what is denoted by the word 'madhu' in the above shanti mantra. And the one who consumes this fruit of his karma is called मध्वदः.   
  
We have the sankalpa, wish, in the Rudram saying: मधु मनिष्ये मधु जनिष्ये, मधु वक्ष्यामि मधु वदिष्यामि मधुमतीं ...  
  
One can see in the shAnkara bhashya for the mantra 'ऊर्ध्वमूलोऽवाक्शाखः’ of Kathopanishat 2.3.1 where the fruit is described as: .....सुखदुःखवेदनानेकरसः प्राण्युपजीव्यानन्तफलः...ब्रह्मादिभूतपक्षिकृतनीडः प्राणिसुखदुःखोद्भूतहर्षशोकजातनृत्यगीतवादित्रक्ष्वेलितस्फोटितहाहामुञ्चमुञ्चेत्याद्य-  
नेकशब्दकृततुमुलीभूतमहारवः....to describe the samsaravRkShaH.  
  
From all this we can conclude that the word 'madhu' to indicate karma phalam by the Upanishad is only an upalakShaNa for both puNya and pApa phala.
