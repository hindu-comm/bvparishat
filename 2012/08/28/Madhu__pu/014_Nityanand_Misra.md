Respected Swami Advayananda  
  
Pranama. This is response to your request of interpretations from other schools. References follow at the end. Please pardon any typos as I have not proofread the below post fully.  
***  
A different interpretation  
***I can talk about the श्रीराघवकृपाभाष्यम् which gives three different meaning of the term मध्वदम्. While शङ्कराचार्यपाद splits the compound मध्वद as मधु (meaning कर्मफल) + अद (in the sense of अत्ति, meaning one who eats or consumes), रामभद्राचार्यचरण has split it as मध्व (with three meanings of कर्मफल, भजनानन्द and मोहमदिरा) + द (in the sense of ददाति for two cases and द्यति for one case which mean one who provides or destroys, respectively).  
  
***A note on मध्व  
***The word मध्व is formed by adding the उणादि suffix अ in the sense of स्वार्थ to the word मधु, i.e. मधु + अ = मध्व. मध्व occurs in the Vedas at several places e.g. RV 1.141.3 and RV 10.5.5. While I have not checked सायण's commentary on the these verses, but Griffith's commentary which is based on the former translates मध्व as "sweet drink". I therefore assume that सायण would have given a similar meaning for मध्व in these to verses - scholars can correct me if I am wrong. As the scholars from मध्व schools on this forum can testify, RV 1.141.3 (in what is also known as the बलित्था सूक्त) is interpreted by the followers of मध्वाचार्य to be a prophesy which predicts that वायु will incarnate as मध्वाचार्य. Although from the viewpoint of सन्धि the name मध्वाचार्य can be split as both मधु + आचार्य or मध्व + आचार्य, it is definitely the latter given that we see terms like मध्वपरिषत्, मध्वसम्प्रदाय, et cetera. So even the name of मध्वाचार्य then comes from the word मध्व which means "sweet drink". A related word is माध्वीक which also is related to मध्व.  
  
***Three different interpretations of मध्वद  
***Coming back to मध्वद, the श्रीराघवकृपाभाष्यम् interprets मध्व which literally means the "sweet drink" as having three meanings of कर्मफल, मोहमदिरा and भजनानन्द. Accordingly the term मध्वदम् is interpreted as  
1. मध्वदं मध्वं कर्मफलं ददाति इति मध्वदः तम्  
2. यद्वा मध्वं मोहमदिरां द्यति इति मध्वदः तम्  
3. यद्वा मध्वं भजनानन्दं भक्तेभ्यो ददाति इति मध्वदः, तम्  
  
***Don't forget the context  
***Why are the meanings different? The reason is that in the श्रीराघवकृपाभाष्यम्, मध्वद is the विशेषण of the सगुण परमात्मा श्रीराम who is the परिपूर्णतम and परात्पर ब्रह्म in the रामानन्द सम्प्रदाय. Readers may want to read the full commentary of the verse to get the full context, along with the commentaries of the preceding and following verses to understand better.  
  
***Differences in interpretation of विजुगुप्सते  
***Another notable difference from शाङ्करभाष्यम् in श्रीराघवकृपाभाष्यम् for this verse is that while the former interprets "न विजुगुप्सते" as "न गोपायितुमिच्छति", the latter takes the meaning of "न विजुगुप्सते" as "न घृणां करोति", citing the Sutra गुप्तिज्किद्भ्यः सन् (3.1.5) and saying that the सन् suffix is applied to the root गुप् in the meaning of घृणा only and not in the meaning of गोपन/रक्षण. On गुप्तिज्किद्भ्यः सन् (3.1.5), the काशिका says - "गुप गोपने (९७१), तिज निशाने (९७२), कित निवासे (९९४) एतेभ्यो धातुभ्यः सन्प्रत्ययो भवति। प्रत्ययसंज्ञा च अधिकृतैव। जुगुप्सते। तितिक्षते। चिकित्सति। निन्दाक्षमाव्याधिप्रतीकारेषु सन्निष्यतेऽन्यत्र यथाप्राप्तं प्रत्यया भवन्ति। गोपयति। तेजयति। सङ्केतयति।" Meaning, as per the काशिकाकारs, the root गुप् gets the affix सन् in the sens of निन्दा (गुपँ गोपने in the sense of "to censure or despise"), in other meanings like रक्षण (गुपू रक्षणे in the sense of "to protect"), the form is गोपयति and not जुगुप्सते. The शाङ्करभाष्यम् disagrees with the काशिका in this respect, while श्रीराघवकृपाभाष्यम् follows the काशिका.  
  
***Coda  
***  
As Swami Advayananda has very commendably suggested, let us not get into which commentary is better or worse, or which is correct or wrong. Let's bring out the alternate explanations and the differences and the reasons behind the differences, and let the readers follow their own discretion in which version they choose to agree with.
