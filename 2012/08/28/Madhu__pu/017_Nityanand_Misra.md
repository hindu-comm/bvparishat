Dear Sri Subrahmanian  
  
Namaste. In my opinion, your conclusion is not correct. The absence of fear (अभयप्राप्तत्वात्) may be a कारक here but that has nothing to do with the तिङन्त form विजुगुप्सते, which is determined by the तिङन्त प्रक्रिया. Also, the ईशावास्य commentary is not relevant to the point here as there is no doubt that जुगुप्सते has the meaning of घृणां करोति by गुप्तिज्किद्भ्यः सन् (3.1.5) as explained by काशिका and कौमुदी. The प्रक्रिया is also very clear in this case and I show it below for your reference:  
  
गुप् -> गुप्तिज्किद्भ्यः सन् -> गुप् सन् (स्वार्थ) -> द्वित्व -> अभ्यास -> गुप् गुप् सन् -> गुगुप् सन् -> पूर्वोऽभ्यासः -> हलादि शेषः -> कुहोश्चुः -> जुगुप् सन् -> सनाद्यन्ता धातवः -> धातुसंज्ञा -> वर्त्तमाने लोट् -> पूर्ववत्सनः -> जुगुप्स त -> जुगुप्सते  
  
The point I highlighted was that आचार्यशङ्कर has explained विजुगुप्सते as "गोपायितुमिच्छति". Since this has the आय suffix before तुमुन् (गोपायितुम्, and not गोप्तुम् or गोपितुम्) this must be the from the गुपू रक्षणे root which gets the mandatory आय suffix in the स्वार्थ sense from the Sutra गुपूधूपविच्छिपणिपनिभ्य आयः (3.1.28). The questions वैय्याकरणs then need to answer are (under the Paninian system):  

Does गुपू रक्षणे get the optional सन् suffix in the sense of इच्छायाम् after getting the आय suffix?

-   If yes, what are the Sutras/Vaarttikas/commentaries which cover this
    case.

Assuming it does get the suffix, is the form जुगुप्सते possible from the root गुपू रक्षणे + आय + सन्?  

-   If yes, what is the प्रक्रिया for the same?

I think the answers to above questions are no. This is based on my limited knowledge, and वैयाकरणs like Dr. Bhat. Dr. Narayanan, Dr. Korada, Dr. Bhattacharya, Dr. Ramanujan would know the best. I will be more than willing to change my opinion if somebody shows the complete पाणिनीय प्रक्रिया generating जुगुप्सते from गोपाय + सन्. The reasons for my understanding are several and are shown below.  
  
Firstly, I understand 3.1.5 to be a पूर्वापवाद of 3.1.7 and so गुप् gets the mandatory सन् in the sense of स्वार्थ from 3.1.5 and not the optional सन् in the sense इच्छा from 3.1.7. As Kashika observes, गुपू रक्षणे does not get this सन्. This is seen in traditional meanings of many सन्नन्त words beginning with जुगुप्स् in Amarakosha and Hemachandra lexicons from गुप्. All such words that I know of have the meaning of "censure/despise" and not "wish to protect" - जुगुप्सन and जुगुप्सा mean abhorrence/dislike (and not desire to protect/hide), जुगुप्सनीय and जुगुप्स्य mean disgusting (and not desirable for protection), जुगुप्सित means something that is disliked (and not something that one wishes to protect), similar case with जुगुप्सिततम/जुगुप्सितत्व, जुगुप्सु means one who dislikes or abhors (and not one who is desirous of protection). Because of different affixes in स्वार्थ - सन् and आय - the forms of गुपँ निन्दायाम् are quite different from those of गुपू रक्षणे. In this context I am reminded of a verse from कविरहस्य which notes the distinction of different तिङन्त form of गुप् for different meanings of the root गुप् -  
**गोपायति **क्षितिमिमां चतुरब्धिसीमां पापाज्**जुगुप्सत** उदारमतिः सदैव  
वित्तं न **गोपयति **यस्तु वणीयकेभ्यो धीरो न **गुप्यति** महत्यपि कार्यजाते  
गोपायति = protects, जुगुप्सते = abhors, गोपयति = hides, गुप्यति=gets perturbed  
  
Secondly, the root गुपू रक्षणे is परस्मैपदी (गोपायति). By पूर्ववत्सनः (1.3.62), the सन्नन्त form has to be परस्मैपदी. However विजुगुप्सते is an आत्मनेपदी form. We sometimes see the आत्मनेपदी form गोपायते but that is from the चुरादिगण उभयपदी धातु गुप् which means "to hide" and not "to protect".  
  
Thirdly, by 3.1.28 गुपू रक्षणे gets the mandatory आय in the sense of स्वार्थ from 3.1.28 which followed by गुण results in the root form as गोपाय. So if it is to get the optional सन् in इच्छायां from 3.1.7, we should have आय in the resulting तिङन्त forms unless there is लोप/अदर्शनम् of आय. जुगुप्सते does not have the आय. I do not know of any Paninian Sutra which says that the स्वार्थक आय suffix when followed by the इच्छार्थक सन् suffix results in the लोप of the आय suffix. Then how this आय vanishes changing गोपाय सन् to गुप् सन्?  
  
Finally I would like to say that saying that an interpretation is not in accordance with Panini's system is not the same as saying that it is incorrect. आचार्यशङ्कर may have relied on some older grammar (ऐन्द्र, चान्द्र, काश्यप, शाकटायन, स्फोटायन) for this explanation which admits the form विजुगुप्सते in the meaning of गोपायितुमिच्छति.  
  
Thanks, Nityanand
