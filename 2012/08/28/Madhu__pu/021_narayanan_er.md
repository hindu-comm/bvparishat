Respected scholars,

Namaskarah. It is clear from Sh. Nityanand Misra's explanation that जुगुप्सते is an atmanepada formation from the root गुपँ गोपने with a स्वार्थे सन् and normal लट् form. For all those four separate group roots, the सेट् factor is well there. It comes to a meaning that गोपनं जुगुप्सा where there is no optional इच्छासूत्रप्रसक्ति. Here I find a few problems beyond my understanding, which attracts an explanation:  
1. What is role of meaning of the preposition वि in विजुगुप्सते?  
2. There is a verse fraction called सन्नन्तान्न सनिष्यते etc. If then how the second optional सन् is justified in जुगुप्सिषते?  
3. How the स्वार्थे सन् (3.1.5) is blocked to the other group गुप्-s of divadi, curadi and even for a partially गुप् of गुपू रक्षणे in the same bhvadi?  
3. The Mahabharata uses a term, *गोपायते* as it reads: गुप्तो *गोपायते* ब्रह्मा श्रेयो वस्तेन शोभनम्।। (Mahabharata-13-70-5). Is it a causative form here? Which root group this *गोपायते has come from?*  
4. Moreover, I think गुप भाषे in Curadi is not an Ubhayapadi, but a Parasmaipadi only. Svaritet or Udattet? Please correct me if I am wrong.  
I appreciate with salute Sh. Nityanand Misra's efforts for demonstration of the classification with derivation of verbs, which is a laborious act with at most dedication to grammar. Thanks.  
Regards,  
Narayanan
