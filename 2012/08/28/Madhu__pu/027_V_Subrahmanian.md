Dear Shri Misra,  
  
Today I had a talk with a renowned scholar about the question on hand.
I read out to him the tabular presentation of yours. At the 4th item he said the word 'jugupsate' will have to be included in addition to what you have stated: जुगोपायिषति. He gave a detailed explanation which I am unable to produce here for the simple reason that it is quite beyond my grasp as I am not a student / scholar of grammar. The scholar summed up saying the usage of Shankara is perfectly within the confines of the Paninian system and there is no need to think that the shAnkaran usage could have basis in any pre-pANinian system. The sutra, which provides for a विकल्प, he said that governs this usage is:  

## 3-1-31 आयादय आर्धधातुके वा 

[ **http://tinyurl.com/cxl7ev4**](http://tinyurl.com/cxl7ev4)  
  
When I pointed out the shruti passage I cited in my latest post:  

//सर्वगं परमात्मानं सर्वं च परमात्मनि ।

यः पश्येत्स *भयाभवान्नात्मानं गोप्तुमिच्छति* ॥ इति सौकरायणश्रुतिः ॥६॥

I think this is the exact way in which Shankara has commented in the Kathopanishad instance that we have seen just now:  

...ततस्तद्विज्ञानादूर्ध्वं आत्मानं न विजुगुप्सते न गोपायितुमिच्छति *अभयप्राप्तत्वात्* । यावद्धि //  
  
the scholar said it perfectly fits the solution to the question on hand and said the same dhaatu can take these three forms: गोपायितुम्, गोपितुम् and गोप्तुम् .  
  
In case you are interested in talking to him I can provide you the contact details by private email. You can discuss this with him and report the details in this forum for the benefit of the other members who are scholars in the vyAkaraNa shAstram. Since the stated scholar is not a member here and does not write in such a forum my suggestion to you to have a talk with him. You may also mention to him the latest question on the Isha bhashyam that you have raised and get a reply. I have not spoken to him about this as I saw this post of yours only subsequently.  
  
Best regards
