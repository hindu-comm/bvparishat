Respected Sri Nityanada Misra and Sri P. Ramanujan,  

Hari Om! Salutations.  
  

Liked very much your inputs of Madhvada as well as vijugupsate. Thank you all very much for all the patient and detailed explanations. I have found them very useful for my reflections.

  

In Shri Guru Smriti,  
Advayananda
