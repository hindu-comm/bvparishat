Dear Scholars,  

Hari Om! Salutations.  
  

Grateful for the inputs regarding 'madhu'.

  

1\. Where else is the Śaṅkarabhāṣya or in the Sāyanabhāṣya do we find such interpretation of 'madhu' as karmaphala?

2\. That Ṛtam can be taken as karmaphala because it is avaśyambhāvi is understandable. But 'madhu' as karamphala, how?

  

In Shri Guru Smriti,  
Advayananda
