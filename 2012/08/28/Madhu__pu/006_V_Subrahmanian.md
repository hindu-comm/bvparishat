Namaste  
  
In my understanding the Rg. mantra referenced and the bhashyam provided by Shri Bhat mahodayaH gives two levels of  
meanings: 1. adhidaivam: where the madhu is water and the Sun is said to draw water thru the rays in the day time. And this  
surya devata is to be meditated upon for high phalam. I am reminded of a somewhat similar sayana bhashyam for the  
'keshi suktam' that we got to discuss a few months ago. 2. The adhyAtmam meaning is that who ever attains this 'madhu' sweet  
knowledge of the Atman who is the Controller of the whole universe attains the moksha phalam. I do not think the meaning 'karma  
phalam' is given in the Rg bhashyam for the word 'madhu' in either of the interpretations.  
  
The Kathopanishat context is different and the body is the place where the jiva resides experiencing fruits of action: madhu.  
This is reminiscent of the 'dvA suparNa' mantra of the Mundaka upanishad (and the 'Rtam pibantau sukRtasya loke' of the Katho-  
nishat, here too the word 'Rtam' means avashyambhAvI karmaphalam ) where the jiva and parama Atma are residing in the body. The pippalam, the fruit of the samsara tree, is being  
experienced, svAdvatti, by the jiva-bird. The other bird simply remains as the witness. When the jiva bird knows about the  
kevala sAkshi rUpa of the 'other' bird, it starts to realize it and finally attains the state of the other bird. Actually there  
are no two birds, for only one consciousness can be there. The division is aupAdhika for the jiva bird.  
  
I thank Shri Bhatt for the bhashyam reproduction.
