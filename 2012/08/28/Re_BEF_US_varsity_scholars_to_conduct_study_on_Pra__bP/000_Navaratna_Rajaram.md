 Who needs these discreditedU.S. scholars to 'study' Hindu rituals? Witzel is trying to rehabilitate himself after the fiasco over the Swamy affair. But why should we cooperate?



 Who is this Finnian Moore Gerety anyway? There is no 'Sanskrit Department' at Harvard anymore, and he may just be a Witzel student.



 And this 'New Study' supposedly 'would deal with all aspects of 'Pravargya' and its impact on nature, would also be a comparison between the philosophical and the practical side of the introductory rituals of the 'Yagas'. " In short, Witzel and his associate (or student) will investigate the 'science' behind the rituals.



First they gave us the 'science' of the Aryan race. Now they want to tell us the 'science' behind Vedic rituals-- putting the Western stamp which is to be accepted as gospel by Indians.
