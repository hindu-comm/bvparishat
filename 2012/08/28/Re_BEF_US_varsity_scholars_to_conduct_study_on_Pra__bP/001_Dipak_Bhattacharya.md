Dear Colleagues,

Some valuable studies on the pravargya are mentioned below

Professor Dr. J.E.M. Houben (at that time just Dr. J.E.M Houben), Sorbonne, conducted an excellent study of the Pravargya, particularly the heating of the mahāvīra pot as reflected in RV 1.164, in the late nineties of the last century. It was published in the *JAOS* 120.4 (2000) pp.499-536. The practical part of the study was conducted at the Vedic āśrama at Baṛshi with help from Pandit Nanaji Kale.

The study was extended with valuable comments on the Indian oral tradition and published under the title ‘TRANSMISSION SANS ÉCRITURE
DANS L’INDE ANCIENNE: ÉNIGME ET STRUCTURE RITUELLE’ in *É̀́tudes Thematiques* 23,*Ecrire et transmettre en Inde classique* Sous la direction de Gérard COLAS et Gerdi GERSCHEMMER, École française d’Extrême-Orient, Paris, 2009.

Prior to Houben’s work significant descriptive account with elements of interpretation could be available with P.V.Kane‘s HDS Vol.2.2 , 1147 ff. Caland-Henri’s well known treatise on the Agniṣṭoma is helpful but without substantial interpretative matter. Compared to these the flimsy account available in the section on the Agniṣṭoma, in A. Hillebrandt’s *R**ITUALLITERATUR.VEDISCHE OPFER UND ZAUBER* 124 mainly offers glimpses of the author’s baseless imagination and does not render any help in understanding the structure of the ritual..

In contrast to Hillebrandt’s rather presumptuous ‘account’, the short account available in Mm. Chinnaswamy Śāstrī’s *Yajñatattvaprakāśa* is rich with account of the most essential parts and valuable hints at interpretation with details of mythological background. The same is true of the famous Agniṣṭomapaddhati.

Even if one missed some detail here one can always take recourse to Louis Renou’s *V**OCABULAIRE DU RITUEL VÉDIQUE* and its English version under the title *A Dictionary of the Vedique Rituals* with an added Gṛhya part by Chitra Bhanu Sen, Delhi 1982(rep.)

The present writer’s general study on ritual structure (unpublished) was based mainly on Mm. Shastrī’s account and partly on the one of Mm. P.V.Kane apart from other traditional accounts like the Ādhānapaddhati and the VSM’s *Śrautakośa* that surpasses the mentioned works in detail but not in interpretation. 

In view of the vast literature available, a new study on the Pravrgya does not seem called for. This is true, particularly for those Indians who have also access to traditional performance.

Best
