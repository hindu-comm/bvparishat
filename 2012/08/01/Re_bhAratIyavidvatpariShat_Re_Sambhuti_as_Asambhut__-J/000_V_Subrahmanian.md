I would refer those interested to the short discussion Shankara initiates at the conclusion of the IshAvAsya upaniShadbhaShya:
'अविद्यया मृत्युं तीर्त्वा विद्यया अमृतमश्नुते’ ’विनाशेन मृत्युं तीर्त्वा असम्भूत्या अमृतमश्नुते’ इति श्रुत्वा केचित्संशयं कुर्वन्ति । अतस्तन्निराकरणार्थं संक्षेपतो विचारणां करिष्यामः । तत्र तावत्किन्निमित्तः संशय इत्युच्यते - विद्याशब्देन मुख्या परमात्मविद्यैव कस्मान्न गृह्यते अमृतत्वं च?.......and concludes: 'अमृतमश्नुते’ इत्यापेक्षिकममृतम्, विद्याशब्देन परमात्मविद्याग्रहणे हिरण्मयेनेत्यादिना द्वारमार्गादियाचनमनुपपन्नं स्यात् । तस्मात् यथाव्याख्यात एव मन्त्राणामर्थ इत्युपरम्यते ।  
  
In Advaita Vedanta the paramAtmajnAni (aparokShajnAni) does not travel to any other loka after death for mokSha. न तस्य प्राणा उत्क्रामन्ति...there is neither utkrAnti nor gati for the jnani. The concluding mantras of this Isha upanishad are of the nature of seeking a path for the upAsaka to reach another loka. From this it is concluded that the 'vidyA' and the 'amRtatvam' involved in this context are not the absolute ones.  
  
Shankara raises the question and answers it even before someone could ask. It is up to oneself to get convinced or not.  
  
Commentators differ in their view of these mantras, as it is the case with most other mantras, sutras and verses of the Bh.Gita.
