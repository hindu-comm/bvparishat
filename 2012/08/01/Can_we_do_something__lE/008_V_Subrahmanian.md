Dear Sri Sastry,  
  
I share your concern on the various issues you have raised. Yes, we must see how best the knowledge-transmission can be augmented and kept alive. I have observed, even in my limited exposure to the Pandita lore, that there are many instances where this pATha - pravachana is going on. In Chennai I know Dr.Mani Dravid SastrinaH, Goda Venkatesha SastrinaH, MahamahopAdhyAya R.Krishnamurti SastriNah are all teaching interested people on a daily basis. A number of people, both from the loukika group and committed students, learn from them. Cutting across mata-bhedas, students come to the first named scholar here for pUrva mImAmsA studies. Similarly I have seen Drs.Prahladachar, Hayavadana Puranik, Haridas Bhatta etc. in the Madhva Vidyapitha in Bangalore teaching a number of people the texts of their school. I heard the famed Vidwan Dr.Ranganatha Sharma in his late nineties is still guiding one or two students in vyAkaraNa shastra. Scholars who have retired have been always eager to transmit their well nurtured and long accumulated specialization to those willing to come to them. I often see Vidwans in one or the other fields even staying home in their native villages to look after their farming activities. Some have told me that they can teach in a Skype enabled environment to those interested.  
  
I have also seen those vidwans that assemble for the annual vAkyArtha sadas at the Sringeri and Kanchi Mutts and other mutts for vidwad goShThi-s etc. being handsomely compensated, rewarded, awarded, honoured, etc. There is constant encouragement to scholars to fine tune their skills, both pedagogic, presentation and writing, and bring out their best for the benefit of the society. I have also seen that only the efficient ones coming to the fore and the others remaining in the background. This is a universal phenomenon not exclusive to Sanskrit/Shastra. I think a level playing field is already there and it is up to the individual to present his best and show his mettle. Only then he gets recognized and all the peripherals like financial security come to him. This is true of every field. I know of qualified Chartered Accountants languishing in mediocre positions. Recently the Tamil Nadu Police was surprised by the number of Ph.D's applying and getting selected for the post of Police constable. The statistics is shocking. Postgraduates and Engineering degree holders have taken up this job. I can compare this in the field of Sanskrit/shastra too. I know quite a few who studied Sanskrit, either vyakarana or sahitya or even vedanta and ended up as purohits or archakas. I would not blame anyone except the individuals who are alone responsible to make or mar their careers. There are opportunities available, can be created even.
But the individual has to feel enthused to seize it. I know of two individuals who started training in the nyAya shAstra together at Sringeri. While one persevered to attain great heights to the extent of editing advanced nyaya texts the other discontinued and ended up in an altogether different avocation. I know of an individual scholar who works in Canada in a Temple but has the capacity to expound the Vedanta texts in Sanskrit or Kannada. What I mean to say is that talent is available. It has to be tapped. Students who really value such talent will go to any extent in supporting such scholars.  
  
I have spoken in the past to Dr.Mani Dravid SastriNah, a front ranking scholar in pUrva mImAmsA and Vednata, and ascertained that he can give lectures on these subjects in Hindi too, apart from Sanskrit and Tamil.
I have felt that if some initiative is there to have his lectures on Vednta recorded in Hindi, the north Indian belt can have a very good exposure to sampradaya Vedanta. I know of a nyaya scholar from Pune who is studying Vedanta with him by staying in Chennai. When I spoke to him I was surprised to know that he has a small family, taken a small house on rent and someone has given him a two wheeler using which he commutes to his Acharya's residence to study. Help comes for people in so many ways. I also know many scholars whose children have distinguished themselves in various non-Sanskrit fields and are quite well off taking care of their parents.
