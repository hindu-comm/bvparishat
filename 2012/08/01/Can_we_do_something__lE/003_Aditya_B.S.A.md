Let me give you the full background on why I'm quite disgusted with the academia in Sanskrit circles. I recently came across a doctorate level student who submitted a copy of his thesis to a renowned Sanskrit teacher, whom I happen to be studying under. The thesis was contained in a book that could be used as a bar-stool, it was that tall. The teacher repeatedly implored upon this doctorate student to explain, in any way he liked, what the thesis was about. But to my utter disbelief, he just say there twiddling his thumbs like a little boy, with discomfort etched across his face, and couldn't say one line about it. He could barely even repeat the thesis title, a lofty phrase indicating a comparative study of two different systems of vyakarana. I don't have to tell you how that thesis managed to get done.

So on the one hand, we have doctorates being awarded to ignoramuses, and on the other, genuinely knowledgeable scholars assume obnoxious airs of intimidation, unduly clipping the wings of interested people who would like to contribute to the language. In a recent case that demonstrated exactly this, a most well-intended question about why Panini used particular letters for anubandhas was answered in such a perverse manner that it indicated the sheer apathy of the scholarly community, and betrayed a lack of respect for the basic tenets of academia.

Since the thread was started with a view to better the conditions of teachers, I don't consider that I made much of a digression.  
But like Sri Nithyananda pointed out, there are many people and organizations who are contributing to dharmic causes. If the cause of traditional Sanskrit teachers could be added to them, with some canvassing by the BVP, it would be a good way to acknowledge and celebrate this Sanskrit Day.

Regards,

Aditya.
