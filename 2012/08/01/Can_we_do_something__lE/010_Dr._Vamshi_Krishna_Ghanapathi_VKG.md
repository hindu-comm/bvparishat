Dear Yadu

  

All said and done, the issue has to be handled with empathy. Rather than dissecting the past, it is better to extend our little support, whatever feasible.



I am sure that the current generation does not limit to teaching alone for their living. Most of them are smart enough to pick up skills to meet their ends meet.  
  
With Warm Regards
