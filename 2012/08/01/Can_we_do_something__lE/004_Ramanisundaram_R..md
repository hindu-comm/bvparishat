Dear Mr. Aditya B.S.A.



I appreciate the justification for your remarks. You are missing the import of the remarks I made. Your comments could have been couched in a soft language with a proposal for implementation. I repeat I am not a Sanskrit Scholar and studied Sanskrit upto my pre-degree stage. I am a Senior Citizen, 70, retired but active.



Think about a structure that could be raised with a focus on the beneficiaries. Rest be assured, money will come through for a noble venture.



Let God Bless you.



R. Ramanisundaram\*
