Respected Scholars! Pranams to all!  
  
    Sravana Purnima Day is approaching just at a distance of less than 24 hours. We are all happy to celebrate "Sanskrit Day" on this occasion. In some institutions Week day celebrations are also going on.
We plan many programs to preserve and propagate the past glory of our greatest language. By the grace and compassion of great Gurus we could have many living scholars among us. It is also an excellent thing to feel proud of.  
  
 But a serious and sensitive problem prevailing through out the country is less concentrated up on by most of us it seems. There are Traditional Gurus, Law makers, Gurus of Law makers, Supporters of Law makers, University Teachers, Teachers working in Colleges, schools, Service oriented organizations and so on.  
  
 Some of us are getting UGC scales. Some others too have sufficient security of pay equal to UGC scales. But there are a majority of teachers who are working on a on consolidated basis or on daily muster based pay which is very insufficient to eat even for twice a day. There is lot of insecurity in the working conditions of most of the teachers. They are not able even to meet the minimum expectations of their families. The days of their temporary service roll fast into years and decades but with no improvement in their standards of living.  
  
 I know certain scholars served some institutions on consolidated payment for three decades and were just necked out of the threshold of their food source with no guarantee given for their future course of living soon they reached an age of 58 or 60. It is a bitter truth that there are PANINIS, GAUTAMAS and JAGANNATHAS among them.  
  
 While this is the plight of the existing teachers year by year new streams are joining the main course increasing the magnitude of the problem.  
  
 There are many more aspects and extensions of this problem which are known well to every one of us.  
  
 Under these circumstances with out simply denying the reality by saying "Sarvam Bhagyayattam" can we do some thing to change the BHAGYAM of our existing troubled generation and future generations also?  
  
 On this Sravana Purnima Day can we all together take any collective decision for initially preparing a one year action plan for improving the working conditions and living standards of the Sanskrit Teachers through out the length and breadth of our country?  
  
 Though this seems to be a thought kindled from a single individual like me thousands of echos can be felt in this. I believe surely it will be of a great help to the future generations too.  
  
 This is just to initialize this plea is submitted. I know all of you have volumes to add to this problem. But a better solution is necessary for this.....! I shall add further many more thoughts for a concrete plan if like minded people come forward and all the elders give enough support.  
  
 This is all neither for leading nor just for pleading but for hoping a better survival of Sanskritists.  
  
 With warm regards,
