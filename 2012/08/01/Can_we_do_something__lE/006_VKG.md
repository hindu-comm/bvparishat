Dear Members

  

It is very pertinent to raise this issue about supporting elderly Sanskrit Scholars. Voluntary contributions are very fine to create awareness and kickstart a dormant/ laggard public administration. However, to sustain such gigantic effort, public funds should be deployed for continuance.

Many schemes by Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan are beneficial for serving teachers, though at a paltry pay scales. But, nothing is conceived for retired teachers.

  

Hence, I recommend that interested members like Aditya, Ramani etc. should join hands to tap funds for Samskruta Bharati, based in Delhi to pursue this policy decision. We require formal lobbying mechanism, (similar to USA) where the dedicated members pursue all the policy makers.

Samskruta Bharati has a good track record. Base in NCR (Delhi) is equally important for such efforts to bear fruit in near future.

  

If required, we all can prepare a petition and sign the papers and present the same to the HRD bigwigs. I was further convinced that President of India, Sri Pranav Mukhyopadhyaya is not only a teacher, but sympathetic to such causes.

  

We can make this Sankalpa to take up the cause of less advantaged Sanskrit teachers. Scheme of TTD, for Old Veda Scholars is a good model, for us to prepare the petition.

Regards
