I am glad to find a very good response from great scholars to my two days old mail..

Yes...I fully agree with Dr. Vamshi Krishna Ghanapathi Ji. This issue is to be handled with empathy.

In fact I am in the safer circle of Sanskrit world at present. As an Associate Professor in Rashtriya Sanskrit Vidyapeeth, Tiruapti I have full assurance for my pensionable service also.

It is not my personal suffering that made me to bring this issue for discussion in this forum. But there are our children like students who have been suffering through many years. Such sufferers among the Sanskrit scholars prevail every where in India. There are thousands and
thousands of Sanskrit teachers in danger zone. Their situation is in a very alarming state.

"Uddhredaatmanamatmana" cannot be in any options of solutions for a such high magnitude problem. Particularly in Andhra Pradesh, only the Corporate colleges are the best feeders of most of the Sanskrit scholars.

At the same time those Colleges are the worst blood suckers of them too. They are very much inhuman in squeezing their blood till the last drop. If these people won't join in these colleges they don't have any other option to work.So what should they do under these circumstances? Besides these Corporate colleges if there are any other junior colleges, degree colleges and Universities wherever there are very less number of Sanskrit teacher posts the existing teachers in those posts are in a very pitiable condition drawing just a consolidated salary of Rs. 5000/- or less even. Same state of plight has been continuing in all these colleges including central schools through many years. Similar conditions are existing in all most all states of our country.  

  

Yes, there are always many idealistic suggestions to change the existing patterns of conventional teaching posts. But it may take many more years to expect and bring such change. But in the meanwhile to bring some essential changes in the existing patterns of teaching posts the present proposal is necessary..

  

I think I am mistaken by some of the scholars. Raising funds cannot solve this problem under any circumstances.  

There should be a gross root level change in the existing patterns of
teaching posts.  

Entire concentration should be on abolishing all different kinds of
nomenclatures of temporary posts and different pay patterns too.

There should be only two Classes : Time scale teachers and Full scale teachers.   

The Past Services of Time Scale Teachers should be given due preference at the time of their absorption at any time in permanent posts.

There should be promotion system even for Time Scale Teachers in proportion to their years of service on parallel lines with the permanent or Full scale teachers.  

  

If such benefits are given the quality of teaching automatically will be better.  

So let all of us try to think in this direction to the extent possible.  

With warm regards,  

**Dr. Rani Sadasiva Murty
