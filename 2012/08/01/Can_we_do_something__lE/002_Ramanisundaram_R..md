Dear Mr. Aditya B.S.A.



You are very strong in your expession. Please structure a project for receiving the funds.



I am not a Sanskrit Scholar; I am retired Corporate Servant. I read all the posting in this blog but do not contribute. You take the assistance of the Senior Sanskrit Scholars in this blog. I am prepared to contribute.



Let God Bless you.
