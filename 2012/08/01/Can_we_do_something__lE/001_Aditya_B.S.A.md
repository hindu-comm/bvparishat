Please let us know your thoughts for this action plan. It is appalling that this post has not evinced a single reply yet from any of the eminent Sanskrit scholars of this group, who are otherwise quick to respond with demonstrations of their learning. It appears as though the few fortunate people who are able to make a respectable living out of Sanskrit are reluctant to help their lesser fortunate colleagues for fear that their achievements might be undermined if a wider pool of talent is generated and enabled.

I believe in 'किञ्चित्कारम्.' Everyone's little mite can go a long way to better the conditions of Sanskrit scholars who are unfortunately not able to live in accordance with the dignity they deserve.

I personally feel that members of this forum ought to contribute a fixed amount on a regular basis for the privilege of membership.

Regards,

Aditya.
