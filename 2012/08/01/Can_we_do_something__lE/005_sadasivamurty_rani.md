Dear Sri Nityanand Misra ji, Dear Sri Aditya Dear Sri Ramani Sundaram Ji and all those who have started thinking in this direction!

Thank you very much for your active response..Here I would like to submit some of my thoughts to add further here.

1. At the out set let them, who have not given their response in this matter, not be blamed or criticized. I am sure most of them have more care and concern in this respect. Some of them are able to do much more than what we are all expecting. But initially a concrete plan is necessary for an finer approach to find out the best solution.

2. I think I am misunderstood by some of the scholars here. My intention is not to mobilize funds from personal pockets for feeding the families of such suffering sanskritists. Even if we collect lakhs of rupees of funds it cannot be sufficient a particular percentage of sufferers perfectly.  

3. So the solution should be other than raising monetary funding for extending any kind of help instead if all the people like it may be done like this.

4. A) A year long action plan should be chalked out. According to that action plan:

 B) All the Sanskritists those who are working on full time or part time basis with or with out UGC salaries should unite together and prepare a statistical data State wise, District wise and Local area wise - of :

i.) How many Sanskrit Teachers are working in each Local area? (May at University level, College level, School level, or may be in any service oriented organizations etc.,)  

ii) How many of them are receiving UGC or State government scale or any other kind of scale with pension assurance and eligibility? Their qualifications and years of their service in permanent posts  

iii) How many of them are just working on part time or temporary basis either on consolidated salary or day wise muster based payment, Their qualifications, The size of their Families and their years of total service rendered by them and other relevant particulars should be collected.

(This list should include : Part timers, Ad hoc teachers, Guest lecturers and any and all kinds of teachers working with different nomenclatures like Research Assistants, Teaching Assistants, Bhasha pundits and so on)  

iv) An All India Sanskrit Teachers' Association should be started with its branches all over India - State wise, District Wise, Area wise and locality wise.

v) On behalf of this organization let a common plea all over India be submitted to ALL the Local, State and Central Government Bodies and Ministries related to Primary, Secondary, Collegiate and Higher Education.

THE CONTENTS OF THE PLEA

1. Let all the existing temporary nomenclatures differentiating the Sanskrit Teachers be abolished.  

2. Let all the different pay systems be cancelled.  

3. Let there be a uniform nomenclature for all (at University level, College level, High school level and primary school level and and other NGOs' level)

4. Let there be only two kinds of pay scale:

 a) Full scale for those who have been appointed on permanent basis

 b) Time scale with some annual increments for those who are temporarily appointed.

5) Let the service of the temporarily appointed teachers also be considered if in course of time they are appointed any where in India provided their service as a temporary teacher is not less than two years.

6) If their service is for more than 5 years as a temporary teacher let it be automatically made permanent.  

7) Along with the years of their service let their designations too be upgraded on par with the permanent staff members.

8) Accordingly there should be only two streams in every institution:

a) Permanently appointed members

b) Timescale members

Leave benefits, medical benefits and such other welfare benefits also may be applied to all equally.

In this manner with many more aspects of this kind let the PLEA be submitted at all levels.

VI) THE DATES OF SUBMITTING THE PLEA AT AREA LEVEL, REGION LEVEL, DISTRICT LEVEL AND STATE LEVEL SHOULD BE SAME.  

VII) FINALLY A PLEA SHOULD BE SUBMITTED AT CENTRAL LEVEL AND TO UGC ALSO.

If necessary a National level meet of all Sanskrit teachers beheld in N Delhi and the ministers and all educational officers be invited attend and the PLEA may be submitted to them for consideration.  

In this process the help of all sympathizers in Government also may be taken. What all is done in this direction be done with the approval and support of the institutions wherever the teachers are working.  

ALL THIS SHOULD BE DONE PEACEFULLY ONLY BUT NOT WITH ANY KIND OF AGGRESSIVE TENDENCY.

This is just a model of plan I have in my mind. Any kind of modifications in this can be made. And let us see whether it is possible to do this kind of thing for the welfare and assured future of Sanskrit teachers.

With warm regards,



**Dr. Rani Sadasiva Murty**

Dear Sh. Aditya  
  
Your concern is justified, this post should see more responses. However, let's not blame anybody here or cast aspersions.  
  
The issue is not people unwilling to donate - in their individual capacity many people from within and outside of academia contribute to causes like publication of Samskrita books, Samskrita organizations, et cetera. If one has to support the vast network of Sanskrit teachers in India, the biggest issue is organization and a grassroot level network. We need dedicated volunteers and trustworthy organizers. In addition to that, one needs to reach out to prospective donors not only in academia, but also to Dharmic industrialists, NRIs, corporates, and professionals. One needs to create pamphlets, organize fundraisers, create awareness, and the like.  
  
So you have two options, either build a network from scratch, or leverage on existing networks like India Development Relief Fund (IDRF) and RSS affiliated organizations which raise funds for many Dharmic causes. The former is very difficult since people do not trust a new NGO or network easily given the rampant corruption and embezzlement of funds in NGOs. Leveraging on an existing network is easier - if people see the backing of Sangha or a similar large network which they can trust, they are more willing to donate.  
  
I believe working with an organization affiliated to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangha is the best option for this. Sangha's Ekal Vidayalaya model is phenomenal - they run 40,000 schools in tribal regions of India and a lot of the funding comes from industrialists and NRIs. Each school is run on a budget of 365 US dollars a day, so the raise at least 15 million USD a year, or more than 80 crore INR. Recession or no recession, Ekal Vidyalaya has fundraising events almost every second day in the US, and chapters in every US city in adddition to active fundraising and chapters in UK, Australia, Singapore and Hong Kong.  
  
I suggest Samskrita Bharati take the lead for this. They are allied to the Sangha, and can leverage on the massive organizational network of Sangha and the experience of Ekal Vidyalaya.  
  
I am in talks with some Indian business owners and professionals in investment banking to organize regular fundraisers for Ekal Vidyalaya here in Hong Kong. If Samskrita Bharati or a similar large network comes forward to take this up, I would be happy to help raise funds for Samskrita teachers. Without a grassroot network, the Marwari businessmen and investment bankers cannot contribute much.  
  
As an immediate step, let Samskrita Bharati or a similar volunteer organization start this project and manage funds for this project. Let them open a new bank account and share the account details. Donations will start coming in soon.  
  
सङ्घे शक्तिः कलौ युगे, Nityanand
