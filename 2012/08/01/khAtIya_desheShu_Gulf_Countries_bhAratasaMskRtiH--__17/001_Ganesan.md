In the SatapatabraahmaNa we have a long mantra where it says that the same God was called 'Bhava' by Baahliika-s (southern Iran ??), Sarva by others, and still others call the same God Isaana, and so it goes on enumerating other countries (which are mostly in the middle-east region) where the same God is known in other names.  
It is all too well known to Sanskritists that Bhava, Sarva Isaana are the different names of Siva and even in such a hoary past these names which are part of His 'eight names' and 'eight forms' (AshTamuurti) was so well known in countries such as Iran and probably in central Asia, etc.  
We also have a separate PaanNini suutra, prescribing 'आनुक्' pratyaya for getting the feminine forms to the names of भव, शर्व, शिव etc. whereby we have the names भवानी, शर्वाणी, शिवानी, etc.  
Therefore it is absolutely correct to say that Vedic culture and Siva-worship was so wide spread in those central Asian and ancient Persia and Egypt.  
We can definitely have legitimate pride in knowing this and there is nothing 'to have a laugh' at this.
