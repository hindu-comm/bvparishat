Respected Bhateji,  
As Sri narayan has rightly given the source I have nothing new to  
this:-) However, this sukaaShTakaM is not even attributed to Sri  
Sankara bhagavatpaada..Anyhow this beautiful octave is full of  
vEdaantic truth and if am not deviating the issue it would be great  
pleasure on my part to bring it to your kind notice that Dr. H.  
SUryanaaraayaNa Bhatta a very good scholar in pUrvOttara-meemaaMsaa  
and jyOthiSha has written and published a beautiful Sanskrit  
commentary on it in the recent times.

regards

ganesh
