Respected sir,

  

<http://learnsanskrit.org/tools/ocr>

  

Here you will get the instructions regarding OCR..

You can also train the fonts.

If the scan copy is good enough, you will get a fairly OK output.

  

The version available on this site has copying facility.

The latest version is a paid version available on Mr. Helwig's site.
