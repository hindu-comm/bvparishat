नमो विद्वद्भ्यः  
  

Dear Shrivatsagaru  
  
kind of you , really did a nice job .  
  
It will be of great help from you to the World of Linguists (all branches including Computational linguistics) , Language specialists , Sanskritists, Philosophers etc., if the book is put into unicode format
and I will be thankful for ever .  
  
Just a point -- the concept of Mahavakya in Vedanta is , in fact, secondary -- tattvamasi is a Vakya pregnant with meaning of the entire Upanisat - so following arthagaurava it is styled Mahavakya - not Sabdagaurava ( like Ramayana etc.) .  
  
धन्यो’स्मि
