This question had been raised in this group some time ago but no  
source was traced in spite of many blogs saying it is stated in  
Veda-s:  
  
<https://groups.google.com/d/topic/bvparishat/X9ccgucxv2Y/discussion>  
  
And here is one discussing the idea, but no source at all verbatim for  
the quotation:  
  
<http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.culture.religion.advaita/11427>  
  
Hope good luck.
