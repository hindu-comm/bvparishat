I reiterate a question that has remained unanswered so far, only because I would like to know the answer.

I would appreciate a reply on how, strictly grammatically speaking, ब्रह्मपराः can mean the interpretation I quoted above.

If such interpretation cannot be arrived at grammatically, what are the reasons for departing from the most direct interpretation as provided in Sri Nithyananda's post, which specifies the etymology of the words with references to amara etc.?

Sri Bhat's vigorous attempts at keeping the thread 'harmonious,' are surely justified. I would only like to add that this forum is a rare place where dialogue between divergent philosophical schools can take place, so it would be nice to let it happen in the interest of knowledge.

In the previous posts, aparam Brahma has been squarely equated with saguna brahma. Do the two concepts perfectly overlap?

Sri Subrahmanian kindly pointed me out to Kathopanishad 1.2.16 & 17. I read the shaankara bhashya for both. The first verse's commentary categorically says 'परं चेत् ज्ञातव्यमपरं चेत्प्राप्तव्म्.'

The next verse is as follows:  
एतदेवालम्बनं श्रेष्ठमेतदेवालम्बनं परम्।  
एतदेवालम्बनं ज्ञात्वा ब्रह्मलोके महीयते।।

Here, the word आलम्बनं is being qualified as श्रेष्ठं and परम्, indicating clearly that what is referred to is the highest form of the upasana. The next line states unequivocally that knowing this आलम्बनं , one attains brahma loka. This verse appears to contra-indicate the interpretation 'परं चेत् ज्ञातव्यमपरं चेत्प्राप्तव्म्.'

Of course, one way to reinforce the above mentioned interpretation would be to simply repeat it, and interpolate, again, the concept of अपरं ब्रह्म, where nothing of the sort has been indicated by the said verses. This is exactly what is done. It seems that this is a continuing trend in the advaita commentary.

To persons who insist that the meanings of the verses shall always depend on one's prejudices based on their respective schools, kindly recognize that a true seeker stands not to lose by accepting a divergent opinion, nor to gain by imposing his own upon another.

I request the forum to not be too hasty in trying to conclude these threads, for I consider it quite beneficial in the interest of enriching my knowledge, and possibly the knowledge of other members, too. The touchiness that arises from a notion that knowledge alone can lead to liberation is confined only to one school of philosophy, and therefore, should not influence those who seek knowledge for its own sake.  

Regards,

Aditya.
