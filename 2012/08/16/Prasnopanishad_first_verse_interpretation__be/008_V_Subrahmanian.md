Namaste  
  
Shankara introduces the Upanishad bhashyam thus:  
  
मन्त्रोक्तस्यार्थस्य विस्तरानुवादी इदं ब्राह्मणमारभ्यते । ऋषिप्रश्नप्रतिवचनाख्यायिका तु विद्यास्तुतये । एवं सम्वत्सरब्रह्मचर्यसंवासादियुक्तैस्तपोयुक्तैर्ग्राह्या, पिप्पलादादिवत्सर्वज्ञकल्पैर्वक्तव्या च, न सा येन केनचिदिति विद्यां स्तौति। ब्रह्मचर्यादिसाधनसूचनाच्च तत्कर्तव्यता स्यात् । - (मन्त्रः)
...अपरं ब्रह्म परत्वेन गताः तदनुष्ठाननिष्ठाश्च ब्रह्मनिष्ठाः परं ब्रह्मान्वेषमाणाः..  
  
Shankara takes the brahmavidyArthin-s as Rshis.  


> How is this interpretation arrived at? What is aparam brahma?

aparam brahma according to Advaita constitutes Hiranyagarbha, virAT and such very important cosmic portfolios. For example, in the Kathopanishat, by the second boon, a certain 'agni vidyA' is sought and taught. Here 'agni' is taught to be meditated upon as the virAT puruSha, someone who has abhimAna in all the creation. The fruit of such upAsana, along with the appropriate karma, is the attainment of a very high loka, sometimes even brahmaloka. As we saw recently in the Isha upanishad discussion the upAsana of hiranyagarbha leads to an exalted loka. Certainly these are lower, apara/avara, when compared to the para brahma prApti, otherwise called moksha. In the context of the prashna mantra, these jignAsus are adepts in the upAsana of the apara brahman, otherwise known as saguNa brahman, now embarking on the true brahmajignAsA.  
  
One can refer to the Kathopanishat mantras 1.2.16 and 17 and the shaankara bhaashya for the mention of para and apara brahman in one place.  One can also have a look at the Prashna up. mantras 5.5 and 6 along with the bhashyam where the particular upasana phalam is stated to be (apara) brahma loka.  
  
Whether it is apara or para brahman is determined by seeing the type of sadhana and the phala.
