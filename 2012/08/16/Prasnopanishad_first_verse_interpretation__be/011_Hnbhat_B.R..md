According to some school, there is no point in repeating what already been disputed in different school at different times. One can get a view of these, in Das Gupta's History of Indian Philosophy with sub-sections and sub-sub=off shoots in each Vedanta school and that is why they differ.

  

If one wants to know about the concepts, please refer to the respective sections which gives the comparison and difference between them. Please don't use such expression such as it seems to be untenable etc. or this is the only right interpretation etc. as they have been contended for millenium past. Specifically Dvaita, Advaita and Vishisthtadvaita, at their highest golden times, which is a treasure of literature by itself, to have a perspective of the sections. Those interested can go through such volumes on each side, written by stalwarts of each school nullifying with others logically and following the tenets of the respects of the schools which may not be accepted as the standards for evaluating the other school. There are few who have learnt all those texts and and the knowledge of present day scholars in each school is limited to the texts they have learnt or come across. Any independent thoughts out of those in the works of each school, can be discussed independently as an independent work on the Upanishads etc, if they are not discussed already in any of the texts in these schools. 

  

This what I can say on this topic as a moderator, so that undue heated discussions may be better avoided and any knew knowledge or theory in these schools, can be introduced to share the knowledge with others and increase the knowledge of the members keeping harmony.

  

According to one school, there is no concept of निर्गुण ब्रह्म, and all such statements proclaiming absence of guNa are interpreted as devoid of demerits. दोषरहित \\and saguNa is described as सकलकल्याणगुणगणनिधि and so on. There have been series of books on the topic by Vaishnava Advaitins and dvaitins, successively refuting the others for a long time, the outputs are available in both the schools and are still studied by their respective scholars. As Mishra have suggested, each concept is valid in the respective school and need not necessarily be accepted by others.

  

In Advaita itself, there are further sub division and theories differing from Shaankara, but they generally accept the other views than those they differ in any given topic.

Even the Bhakta-s of VaishNava-s, follow both, dvaita and advaita, and subscribe to the views of their school and contend the views of others. The Advaita and dvaita schools have witnessed series of works for a long time started

with their respective views defended and others' views and concepts contended and refuted as a result we have treasure of books in each schools. Interested people can go through both the series and find if they can resolve the difference for ever. At least one has to go to the depth of the accepted concepts in the school, than passing individualremarks if one wants to know really what is meant according to that school.

  

Thanks for all those who contributed to the topic.
