Dear Sri Veeranarayana,

Let me make it very clear to you that your reaction is very shortsighted, not to mention shockingly immature, given your credentials. Unless a next generation of Sanatana Dharma followers are able to come out in the open, present their various views, disagree about them if they must, and revive the tradition of active debate in the realm of philosophy, we are staring at a future where our entire body of philosophical thought and literature will lapse into the hands of an ignorant people, and the insights of our ancestors on such questions as consciousness and liberation will be lost forever.

I'm hoping to God that it was only a peculiarity of expression that made you say 'we have other enemies.' If you were serious, it is a matter of deep concern. I want to make it clear to you that Hinduism's fundamental quality is magnanimity of thought, which is why we are still here. Unless we fortify our magnanimity with more of the same, we cannot successfully transition into the 21st century. And for that, we need to keep debate alive, because it reminds us that no one has a monopoly on the truth, especially in philosophy. In the same breath, I also say that one can recognize a particular school of thought to be superior to others. This is not contradictory. This is fundamental to all Hindus.

The people who you call our enemies can be won over if we stick to who we are, differences and all.

Might I also tell you that because you are part of the academic fraternity, it is your special responsibility to encourage healthy debate and discussion, and not muzzle it in a passive aggressive way, which is where our immediate previous generations faltered.

Please remember, at the end of the day, if push comes to shove, our so called enemies will not listen to our refutations. There is a place for the pen. There is a place for the sword. Do not confuse the two.

Regards,

Aditya.
