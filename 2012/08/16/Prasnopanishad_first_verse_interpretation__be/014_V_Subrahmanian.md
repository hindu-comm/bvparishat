Namaste.  
  
I wish to make some observations/clarifications with regard to the present discussion.  
  
The very first post on this topic sought clarifications on the 'Advaitic' interpretation. That is why I stuck to that in my response.
So, to complain that the reply is fully 'according to advaita..' is not reasonable.  
  
In my previous response I had not included a particular explanation as I had not studied the bhashyam with the editorial notes. Now such a study reveals that Shankara has already considered the meaning 'brahma = veda'. In the Brahmasutra bhashyam 1.3.9.36 we find this very prashna mantra cited:  ब्रह्मपरा ब्रह्मनिष्ठाः परं ब्रह्मान्वेषमाणा एष ह वै तत्सर्वं वक्ष्यतीति ते ह समित्पाणयो भगवन्तं पिप्पलादमुपसन्नाः ॥१॥ The context is the 'apashUdrAdhikaraNam' where it is being shown that upanayana, etc. samskaras are required for the seeking and teaching of (brahma)vidyA. The above mantra is in no way useful in this context excepting for the fact that it contains the term ब्रह्मपराः which is brought out by the gloss 'bhAShyaratnaprabhA' which says: ब्रह्मपराः वेदपारगाः, सगुणब्रह्मनिष्ठाः परं निर्गुणं ब्रह्मान्वेषमाणाः ...षडृषयः तमुपगता इत्यर्थः । Thus, although the upanishad bhashyam did not say anything specifically about the word 'brahma' meaning 'veda', the sutrabhashyam context where this mantra is cited, for this very purpose, gives this meaning. The BhAmatI of Vachaspati Mishra whose period is said to be soon after Shankara, though not explaining the meaning, gives the general explanation about the upanayanam-specific nature of the discussion in this sutra-bhashya.  
  
Some more responses are given below:

An explanation can depend on the context too and not only grammar. As was explained already, the Upanishad is aiming at giving the knowledge of the Supreme Brahman, for moksha. Since the word 'param' is there, there is every justification to see that there is an apara brahman too.
There are expressions like 'param dhAma' which clearly distinguishes the Supreme abode, from where there is no return to samsara, from other abodes like svarga and brahmaloka.  
  
The Amarakosha for the word 'brahman':  
  
**ब्रह्मात्मभूः** सुरज्येष्ठः परमेष्ठी पितामहः ( १. १. ३२)  
*हिरण्यगर्भो* लोकेशः स्वयंभूश्चतुराननः ( १. १. ३३)  
धाताब्जयोनिर्द्रुहिणो विरिञ्चिः कमलासनः ( १. १. ३४)  
स्रष्टा प्रजापतिर्वेधा विधाता विश्वसृग्विधिः ( १. १. ३५)   
  
apart from the other description of the word 'brahman' referring to Veda, tapas, etc. in the Amara. Apart from these, the Veda, the Bh.Gita, specify another 'Brahman' clearly distinguished from 'brahmA', Hiranyagarbha, etc. In fact the name 'Indra' can also refer to brahman as can be seen in the Br.Up. 'indro mAyAbhiH pururUpa Iyate..'

That 'brahman' to which any activity like creation, karma-phala dAnam, etc. is attributed is both apara and saguNa brahman. It would be beneficial to read the small piece that Sri S.Jagannath posted in this thread as an image from the Brahma sutra bhashya of Shankara on the 'two' typed brahman. I would also recommend the book: व्यासतात्पर्यनिर्णयः which I mentioned in this forum recently for a fine presentation of the 'saguNa brahman' which is a unique term in Advaita.
One can get to know what exactly this means. I can help anyone procure that book in Sanskrit (and a Kannada translation in a separate book) costing just Rs.35.

A study of the Bhagavadgita can make things very clear. We have the Lord teaching:  
  
**चतुर्विधा भजन्ते** मां जनाः सुकृतिनोऽर्जुन ।  
आर्तो जिज्ञासुरर्थार्थी ज्ञानी च भरतर्षभ ।। 7-16 ।  
  
There is One Deity/Shakti that is like a chintAmaNi; it gives whatever one seeks from it. The OmkAra (in the Kathopanishat context) or the Lord Himself in the Gita context or some other devatAs in the Gita:  

** कामैस्तैस्तैर्हृतज्ञाना: प्रपद्यन्तेऽन्यदेवता:।**

**तं तं नियममास्थाय प्रकृत्या नियता: स्वया॥20॥**

 अनेक प्रकार की कामनाओं के चलते समझ खराब हो जाने से (बहुतेरे लोग) अपनी-अपनी रुचि के अनुसार विभिन्न देवताओं की शरण में उन्हीं-उन्हीं के नियमों के अनुसार जाते हैं।20।

**यो यो यां यां तनुं भक्त: श्रध्दयार्चितुमिच्छति।**

**तस्य तस्याचलां श्रध्दां तामेव विदधाम्यहम्॥21॥**

**स तया श्रध्दया युक्तस्तस्याराधानमीहते।**

**लभते च तत: कामान्मयैव विहितान् हितान्॥22॥**

 जो-जो भक्त जिस-जिस देवता की पूजा श्रध्दा से करना चाहता है उस-उसकी उसी श्रध्दा को मैं-परमात्मा-अचल बना देता हूँ (और) वह उसी श्रध्दा के साथ उस (देवता) की आराधना करता भी है। (मगर) उसके बाद अपनी इच्छा के अनुकूल मेरे ही दिये पदार्थों को पाता है।21।22।

  

It is the One Lord/Power alone that is the object of meditation/prayer for a variety of goals/phalams. In the Kathopanishat 1.2.15 Yama, in reply to Nachiketa's question about the Supreme Brahman (anyatra dharmAt....) replied: सर्वे वेदा यत्पदमामनति...तत्ते पदं ’सङ्ग्रहेण’ ब्रवीमि - ओम् इत्येतत् । This 'Om' is the symbol (pratIkam) for Brahman. It is also the word that denotes Brahman: ओम्-शब्दवाच्यम् ब्रह्म. In the next mantra we have Yama explain that this 'akSharam' Brahma is Param and also aparam (because the word 'param' is used for one occurrence of the word Brahman. By पारिशेष्यन्याय the other word brahma is explained in the bhashyam as aparam. This is reinforced by the word 'यो यदिच्छसि’ 'whatever one desires for, he will get that'. If one desires any goal/fruit other than moksha, he will get it by meditating upon the same Om. If, on the other hand, he is aiming at mokSha alone, he will get that by meditating upon the same Om. As told in the Bh.GitA, the One Deity is meditated upon through various devatAs who are also His own manifestations, but the people and their goals vary. The phaladAtA is the One Lord Brahman alone either directly (for moksha) or through other deities if the goals are other than moksha.
Thus there is a natural scripture-based distinction between the Absolute Lord into the Supreme (para) and the 'others' (apara) Brahman.  

  

The next mantra which is specifying the phalam of the method/mode of meditation spoken of in the previous mantra, says the श्रेष्ठं परम् आलम्बनम् ब्रह्म, when realized, in the manner one has determined to do ( either the Supreme Brahman/moksha or the other non-moksha fruits) will attain the appropriate fruit. In the manner of the Gita depiction of the four types of devotees seeking four different fruits, the Upanishad talks of different phalams for different upasanams.  

  

Thus, without any need for 'interpolation' one can see how neatly the bhashyam explains the purport of the mantras. One can appreciate it only when one has the familiarity with the complete shAstra, the prasthaana traya, that includes the Bh.Gita, the Brahma sutras and the Upanishads. In the determination of the above 'parApara vibhAgaH' the crucial words in the 16th mantra is: yo yadicchati tasya tat. \[what one desires that one gets.\] That is the continuous trend of the Upanishads.  

  

More than any of the above reasons, the strongest proof of this 'vibhAga' is the very Prashnopanishat teaching itself:

  

एतद्वै सत्यकाम परं चापरं च ब्रह्म यदोंकारः। तस्माद्विद्वानेतेनैवायतनेनैकतरमन्वेति। ५.२  

  

One can read the Shankara bhashya to know the exact meaning of this mantra and its exact correspondence with the Kathopanishat mantras/bhashya that I have discussed in the foregoing. Thus, one will realize that the 'paraApara vibhAga' with respect to Brahman is not the invention of Advaitins but a well laid out method of the Upanishads themselves.

I agree with the above thinking. In fact I had cited the Kathopanishat mantras just out of a hunch. But when I saw the editorial notes for those mantras, I found to my pleasant surprise that they have a striking similarity to the Prashnopanishat mantra cited above. Thanks to the eminent scholar who has edited that book, I stand to gain a lot from this discussion.  I quote that editorial footnote for the Kathopanishad mantra here:  
  
एतद्ध्येवाक्षरं ब्रह्म - अपरम् इत्यर्थः, उत्तरत्र ’परम्’ इत्युक्तेः ।
’एतद्वै सत्यकाम *परं चापरं च ब्रह्म* यदोंकारः। तस्माद्विद्वानेतेनैवायतनेनैकतरमन्वेति” इति प्रश्नोपनिषद्वाक्येनैकार्थ्यात् ।

I am enthused to quote from a Kannada book 'mata traya samIkShA' authored by Dr.A.V.Nagasampige, Director of the Purnaprajna Samshodhana Mandiram, Bangalore. At the end of the book that gives a fairly good view of all the three schools of Vedanta, the author enumerates some points that are common to all the three schools. One such point is:  
  
Bhakti alone is the upAya for mukti is acceptable to all the three Acharyas:  
  
एवं भगवतः सत्यप्रतिज्ञत्वं बुद्ध्वा भगवद्भक्तेः अवश्यंभावि मोक्षफलम् अवधार्य भगवच्छरणैकपरायणः भवेत् इति वाक्यार्थः।। (bhagavadgita18.65 bhashyam of Shankara)  
  
....विशदतमप्रत्यक्षतापन्न-अनुध्यानरूपभक्त्यैकलभ्यः । ( 'vedArthasangrahaH p.96)  
  
भक्तिस्त्वेका विमुक्तये ( mahabhArata tAtparya nirNayaH 1.98 of Madhva)  
  
To those who are familiar with the Shaankara bhashya it is quite well known that for Shankara parAbhakti is none other than parAjnAnaniShThA.
