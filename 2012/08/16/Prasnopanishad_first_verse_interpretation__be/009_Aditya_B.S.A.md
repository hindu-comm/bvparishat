Sri Lalitalalita,

Thanks for your responses. My reason for asking is to try and understand how the aparam brahma concept has been segued into the interpretation of this verse's import. I would appreciate a reply on how, strictly grammatically speaking, ब्रह्मपराः can mean the interpretation I quoted above.

Furthermore, because apara brahma appears from time to time in advaitic interpretation, I wanted to know more about it.

You asked if I had learnt advaita. Definitely not like you have learnt it. I'm reading the shaankara bhashya with an open mind. As for your fatalistic declaration: 'अभ्यस्तञ्चेत्किं प्रश्नेन ।नाभ्यस्तं चेत्किं प्रश्नेन ', I'm wondering what you do when questions arise in your mind? If you have learnt advaita, it seems questions will not arise. If you have not learnt advaita, you say they should not arise, because ' यो न विशेषज्ञः तस्य किं प्रयोजनं विशेषलक्षणेन'. Does it not occur to you that a learner has a प्रयोजन with विशेषलक्षण, which is simply that of learning? Or maybe that is something you have left behind in your elevated state.

Most of your statements contain circular reasoning. You say 'वस्तुतो भेदाभावेन द्वित्त्वस्यैवास्वीकारेण सम्बन्धास्वीकारात् ।' It's quite clear that you're wording one premise in different ways and passing it off as a conclusion.

To me, the concept of apara brahma appears quite untenable in the context of interpretation of this verse. Maybe you can show me how that's not true, if you are so inclined.

The commentary quoted by Sri Nithyananda comes across as more logical, straightforward, and contextually sound.

Regards,

Aditya.
