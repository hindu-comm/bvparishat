If I remember correctly, the very first post on this topic ended with "And how have the other schools interpreted this part?" The poster was interested in knowing explanations in other schools apart from the Advaita one. So it is only reasonable that views in this context be attributed to the correct school and views from other schools be given. It is unreasonable to label any clarifications as complaints.
