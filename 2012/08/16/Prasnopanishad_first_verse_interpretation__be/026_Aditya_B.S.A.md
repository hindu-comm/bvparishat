Gentlemen, thanks for all the answers this thread has received since my last post. It was evident to me that the thread's inundation had to be handled with care, so I went through the Prasnopanishad in some detail, and allowed some time to pass to quell any knee-jerk responses from my side.

Before going into the details of this reply, I'd like to say another word or two about my motive in questioning the Advaita interpretation of the said Upanishad. Primarily, I'm a seeker. There is no doubt that my belief in Vishishtadvaita as propounded by Bhagavad Ramanuja lends itself to an evaluation of Advaita as a poorva paksha, which could adversely affect my understanding of Advaita interpretation. So, while this observation from any of you will always be justified, let me remind you that resorting to it comes with the implicit responsibility of pointing out where my bias has marred my judgement. Likewise with remarks claiming I cannot fully understand Advaita unless I know the entire prasthana traya, etc. Otherwise, such observation is mere grandstanding for scoring points. I hope you will keep this in mind while replying.

Now, for a quick recap of the main issues this thread has raised (apologies in advance for putting Sanskrit words in English. I'm not adept at typing Sanskrit on my smartphone):

1\. The Advaita interpretation of brahmaparaah (Pras.Up.1.1) as aparam brahma paratvena gataah.

2\. The interpretation of brahmaparaah according to other schools.

3\. The enunciation of aparam brahma, which necessitated discourse on param brahma, which spawned many elaborate posts, some explaining Advaita philosophy, and others focussing on the various rules of interpretation.

My observations are as follows:

As far as the interpretation of brahmaparaah in the said verse, assuming the validity of 'aparam brahma paratvena gataah', it means that the said disciples were adepts in the upasana of aparam brahma as param brahma, a fact which none of the replies directly elaborated. Putting this together with Advaita's interpretation of aparam brahma as saguna brahma, it means that at some point of time, these exalted disciples performed upasana of saguna brahma as param brahma, and now, as claimed by Sri Subrahmanian, they are supposedly embarking on 'true brahmajignyasa,' where true indicates param brahma, a.k.a nirguna brahma. If this were the case, the attribute of paratva, formerly ascribed to saguna brahma (aparam brahma paratvena gataah), is now sought to be ascribed to nirguna brahma. Further, according to Sri Subrahmanian, this inclination is the prasada of saguna brahma. Assuming all this to be true, which is a very generous assumption indeed, these exalted disciples are tutored in the knowledge of nirguna brahma by Bhagavan Pippalaada. In order to realize this nirguna brahma, they have to first distinguish it as para brahma, so that they are not confusing it with apara brahma, who is saguna. This very same paratva is antithetical to nirguna brahma, which is attributeless. If recognizing paratva of nirguna brahma was a step towards realizing nirgunatva, but not the same as nirgunatva, then as long as they are parambrahmaanveshamaanaah, they cannot find nirguna brahma who is by definition devoid of paratva. It becomes quite plainly evident that the param brahma of the said Upanishad is not nirguna brahma. Bear in mind that I am not assuming anything different than what has been mentioned by Sri Subrahmanian in his replies. I am only pointing out what I think are the consequences of following an Advaita interpretation. Do enlighten me of any lacunae in my analysis.

So much for the above interpretation, which I hold to be fundamentally untenable because it ignores a more basic, less abstruse line of approach that has been followed by other philosophical schools, which requires no alien concept of nirguna brahma as Advaita sees it.

As far as the highly knowledgeable posts of Sri Bhat and Sri Korada, I am grateful to have picked up some useful things from their vast learning.

However, insofar as they attempt to defend Advaita's interpretation of the above verse and the Upanishads in general with respect to the concept of nirguna brahma, I believe they are using concrete concepts to build castles in thin air, which, of course, is their prerogative to do.

Regards,

Aditya.
