The following excerpt is from the first verse: "...ब्रह्मपरा ब्रह्मनिष्ठाः परं ब्रह्मान्वेशमाणाः..."

The word brahmaparaa has been interpreted as अपरं ब्रह्म परत्वेन गताः in the advaita commentary.

How is this interpretation arrived at? What is aparam brahma?

And how have the other schools interpreted this part?

Regards,

Aditya.
