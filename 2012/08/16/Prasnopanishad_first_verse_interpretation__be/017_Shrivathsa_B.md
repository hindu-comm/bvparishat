hariH OM,

  
  
  
"All of this is "according to Advaita" only. The Anuvṛtti of the phrase "according to Advaita" runs from first sentence right upto last sentence of the above paragraph by Sh. Subrahmanian."  

 Advaita doesn't claim any descent from heavens. It just repeats what shruti has been saying since the beginning of creation. At no point in his bhAShyas sha\~Nkara asks anyone to accept anything on his authority, but the authority of shruti. He doesn't claim any divine birth, something claimed by many to obfuscate the obvious logical fallacies in their theories.

  
  

"As per the Vaiṣṇava doctrine, there is no difference (Bheda) between Nirviśeṣa/Nirguṇa Brahman and Saviśeṣa/Saguṇa Brahman. In the Śrīrāmacaritamānasa (a work liked by even Advaitasiddhikāra Madhusūdana Sarasvatī and a work considered authoritative by adherents of all subschools of Vedānta), Tulasīdāsa gives the example of water, snow and hail-stone (RCM 1.116.3) to say that just like water which has no shape or form is not different from a mountain of snow or a hailstone with a definite shape or form (the distinction is the state of matter), the Nirguṇa Brahman is no different from Saguṇa Brahman."

 So, there is a similar anuvR^itti (which was alleged against shrii subrahmaNian's post), that of "vaiShNava doctrine". One wishes to know what saguNa one sees in deep sleep (the subject matter discussed in mANDUkya). If one were to keep seeing / hearing / talking one's iShTa even in one's sleep, one would go mad very soon. The very existence of man depends on the suShupti avasthA where he sees nothing, hears nothing etc. according to shruti pramANa, he is in himself.  
Secondly, one doesn't need authorities to like any work. I love reading the mAnas and not because it was appreciated by madhusUdana sarasvatii (in fact, this is the first time i heard this).  
 I am not an authority on the mAnasa, but I have enjoyed the following verse for a long time: "aguna saguna bicha nAma susAkhi, ubhaya prabodhaka catura dubhAShii" which in my understanding amounts to: between aguNa and saguNa, the nAma is a good friend and acts like a bilingual and teaches us about both. In case you claim the mAnasa to be a "vaiShNavite" work, why would he have used "ubhaya prabodhaka" (giving knowledge of "both", instead of, as your claim is, "one"). Conclusion: The mAnasa isn't "vaiShNavite" as per your definition.

  
  
"As per the Vaiṣṇava view, the wise Bhaktas choose Bhakti of Saguṇa Brahman over the eight Siddhis, the nine Nidhis and the four types of Mukti (RCM 7.119.7). The Vaiṣṇava Bhakta attains either the Vaikuṇṭhaloka, Sāketaloka, or Goloka depending on whether the Iṣṭa is Viṣṇu, Rāma or Kṛṣṇa."

 No problem with this. It is one's individual choice. Advaita isn't contrary to bhakti at all.  

"So while the Advaita view considers Apara Brahman/Saguṇa Brahman to be lower or inferior to Para Brahmnan/Nirguṇa Brahman, the other Vedānta subschools equate the two and say the Bhakta prefers Saguṇa Brahman to Nirguṇa Brahman."

 Which goes against common experience of deep sleep where there is no pratyaya of any iShTa and hence gives us the greatest Ananda. (as per the shruti, he gets the greatest Ananda because he is in himself having withdrawn from the world. c.f. bR^ihadAraNyaka gArgya - ajAtashatru discussion).  
  
svasti,  
       JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,  
                              
shrivathsa.
