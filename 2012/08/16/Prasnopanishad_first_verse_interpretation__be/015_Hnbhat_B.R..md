ब्रह्म परं येषां ते - ब्रह्मपराः, just like तत्परः।

or in the same compound as it meaning whether it be

  

 "वेदस्तत्त्वं तपो ब्रह्म ब्रह्मा विप्रः प्रजापतिः"

  

बृहि वृद्धौ, शब्दे च। बृंहिर्नोऽच्च (द.उ. ६.७४) इति मनिन्-प्रत्यये, धातूपधनकारस्याकारे, पश्चाद् यणि, रूपम्। ब्रह्म. "ब्रह्म परं तेजः, वेदश्च।

बृंहति = वर्धते, अतिशयमहत्त्वलक्षणवृद्धिमान् भवति इति ब्रह्म - वेदः, अथातो ब्रह्मजिज्ञासा, जगज्जन्माद्यस्य यतः, इति बादरायणसूत्रोक्तं ब्रह्म तत्त्वम्। बृंहते = वेदमधीते, पारायणं करोति इति ब्रह्मा - विप्रः, ब्रह्मा एव ब्राह्मणः। अथवा, ब्रह्म - वेदः, तदधीते तद्वेद वा ब्राह्मणः। 

  

whether it be the तत्त्व - defined as "जन्माद्यस्य यतः" etc, in वेदान्त, or any one of the above meanings. With any meaning, the compound form would be ब्रह्मपराः .

  

It is the same compound grammatically tenable equally, whether it be बहुव्रीहि or तत्पुरुष.

  

ब्रह्म परं येषां ते ब्रह्मपराः, which makes the similar meaning as the two others. That is why others differ, as all the three ब्रह्म words in the same sentence mean the same thing, all the phrases would me meaningless. ब्रह्मपराः = ब्रह्मनिष्ठाः, परं ब्रह्मान्वेषमाणाः , would leave us with a question, if the same ब्रह्म in three compounds, why once they are ब्रह्मपराः and ब्रह्मनिष्ठाः should search for परं ब्रह्म another brahma, whether it be superior or inferior, which is the literal meaning of पर, another, superior etc. which is relative term. By qualifying the other to be the object of अन्वेषण, with पर, one has to seek a different meaning, otherwise it will be meaningless, who are ब्रह्मनिष्ठाः - attained ब्रह्म, are looking for परं ब्रह्म. It is by अर्थापत्ति, that makes the first two mean differently. So by पर qualification, it automatically would mean now they have attained अपरब्रह्म, but ब्रह्मपर is explained in the same way as अपरब्रह्मपर logically by both.

  

The interpretation by शङ्कराचार्य has been explained by the टीका reproduced by ललिताजी, exactly as I have explained above:

  

> टीका तत्रेयं -  
> "ब्रह्मपराणां पुनर्ब्रह्मान्वेषणमयुक्तम् - इति ।  
> अत आह - अपरं ब्रह्म - इति ।"

  

and explained further by ललिताजी himself. Except giving the etymology, being too common for all.

  

The same question has been solved by taking a different meaning itself taking resort of the same lexicon, वेद{अध्ययन}निरताः, ब्रह्म(तपसि)निष्ठाः, without any change in the meaning of ब्रह्म or पर. The meaning is arrived at in the same way, literarily and not literal meaning as it is an adjective meaning many different things as I had given in my first post. There are many other formations, with पर as the last second member which gives the similar meaning (but need not be the same meaning). This is the technical difinition of the words पर and अपर
according to वैशेषिक सूत्र -

  

एकदिक्काभ्यामेककालाभ्यां संनिकृष्टविप्रकृष्टाभ्यां परमपरं च २१ ...

  

Whether it be relative terms as this and other or earlier and later, or many shades of meaning with these two. The one has another counter part and not stand alone term पर which is the basis of the division.

  

Now, please make it clear what made you think it is not grammatically not acceptable. Grammar governs the formation of the word and whether it be compound, or not. But when a doubt arises, there are many other things to be taken into consideration in deciding the meaning, of the context takes place next to the lexical meaning as per

  

वाक्यपदीय द्वितीय काण्ड --

  

अर्थः प्रकरणं लिङ्गं शब्दस्यान्यस्य संनिधिः।३१५।

सामर्थ्यम् औचिती देशः कालो व्यक्तिः स्वरादयः ।

शब्दार्थस्यानवच्छेदे विशेषस्मृतिहेतवः ।।३१६॥

  

While this is the position in ordinary language, governed by grammar,
Vedic Literature has some more elements to arrive at a conclusion:

  

उपक्रमोपसंहारौ अभ्यासोऽपूर्वता फलम् । अर्थवादोपपत्ती च लिङ्गं तात्पर्यनिर्णये ॥

  

is the common dictum followed by both the मीमांसा schools, पूर्वमीमांसा and उत्तरमीमांसा.

  

And recent post by Mr. Subrahmanyam make a concordance of the concepts in different places by शङ्कर himself.

  

Now it is your turn, what made you think the interpretation of Advaita school, is not grammatically unacceptable, if your intention is to know more about these concepts or interpretations. It has already been quoted,

  

शब्दब्रह्मणि निष्णातः परं ब्रह्माधिगच्छति॥

  

which also presupposes शब्दब्रह्म is different from परब्रह्म. As the term is relative, the higher one presupposes the lower state/stage in position. It is only the difference of the concepts related that made each school offer different interpretations and not the grammatical incompatibility as far as I know. In ordinary language, any other meaning is accepted as लाक्षणिक if there is incompatibility of meaning. like कुशलः, प्रवीणः etc. In शास्त्र-s they differ in theories. Like सत्कार्यवाद, असत्कार्यवाद, विवर्तवाद, परिणामवाद, शून्यवाद etc. and so on according to their concepts of the Cause and Effect relation. Each school would refute the other theory and that adds to the progression of the relevant शास्त्र from time to time.

  

But our great commentator and philosopher, shows his highest position through his works criticizing earlier views established his own theory upholding the importance of रस refutes all other theories in prevalance, and at the same time shows greatest humility and respect to earlier commentators in acknowledging their toils who helped to arrive at such a conclusion, in his commentary अभिनवभारती in the introductory verses ---

  

ऊर्ध्वोर्ध्वमारुह्य यदर्थतत्त्वं

धीः पश्यति श्रान्तिमवेदयन्ती।

फलं तदाद्यैः परिकल्पितानां

विवेकसोपानपरम्पराणाम्॥

  

चित्रं निरालम्बनमेव मन्ये प्रमेयसिद्धौ प्रथमावतारम् ।

सन्मार्गलाभे सति सेतुबन्धपुरप्रतिष्ठादि न विस्मयाय ॥

  

Especially the second verse makes much beautiful sense and reminds the shorter सुभाषित -

  

"विद्वानेव विजानाति विद्वज्जनपरिश्रमम्।"

  

It is his greatness to acknowledge the toils of the earliest commentator who had no other guide to direct him as we have today.

  

Sorry for the lengthy message.
