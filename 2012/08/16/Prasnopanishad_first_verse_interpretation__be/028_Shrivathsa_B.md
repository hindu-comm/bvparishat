hariH OM,  
  
 I agree with shri vnp on his views. We should concentrate on the real threats rather than raise imaginary ones.  
  
 Moreover, this discussion was anyway descending into an area of personal choice as aditya himself seems to convey in his words:

  
"So much for the above interpretation, which I hold to be fundamentally untenable because it ignores a more basic, less abstruse line of approach that has been followed by other philosophical schools"  
  

 Why should we use things like "less abstruse", "I hold" etc. if indeed our discussion be "objective"? loko bhinnaruciH.

  
  
svasti,  
 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,  

shrivathsa.
