Simply put, if someone is brahmapara and brahmanishtha, and the referent of the word brahma here is already param brahma, then he would have no need to further search for param brahma (anveshana). This is what is succinctly explained in the citation provided by Sri Lalitaalaalita. For the SAnkara bhAshya, it is a straightforward conclusion that brahma here is notâ€“param brahma, ergo aparam brahma.

To take brahman here as referring to the veda is also a valid interpretation, as done in the newer bhAshya cited by Sri Misra.
