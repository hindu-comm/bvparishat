Dear Subodh,  
  
My mature Jyotish astrology student, Rameshrao Narayan explains that because  
the gestation period of cows is almost exactly the same as for humans, their flesh  
is vibrationally equivalent to human flesh. Therefore, *eating any Bos species, e.g.  
*B Indicus or B. Taurus,** *has the same vibrational effect and karmic consequences  
as cannibalism*!!!  
  
No better reason for avoiding beef,  
All best wishes,  
  
Alex
