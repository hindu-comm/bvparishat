Dear Sh. Arvind Kumar  
  
The quality of images is very bad and I cannot read anything on the invitation except the text in big font size. Could you please scan again and send to the group, preferably as a PNG or JPG with higher quality settings? Or host them on the web somewhere. The image size will increase but at least the readers will be able to read the invitation.  
  
Thanks, Nityanand
