Theoretically a check leaf should contain all the Indian languages, having script, even after the language wise states division it would be at least 18 or more for the Rupees/रुपये and Pay/?

  

and the words to be filled in the Pay order. Think how big cheque leaf it could be! and it would provide for employment of translators between language too. Good Idea.

  

Otherwise, the check leaves are prepared in two languages and are expected to be filled in the respective languages. And not Five सहsraM सिर्फ़् or to be a readable Pay order unless and otherwise the Reserve Bank or competent authority fixes the form and its language.

  

Think of a check leaf having all the 17 or more languages in its Pay order, which is in a fixed form through out the banks.
