Dear Scholars,  
  
Most of us know that since long the authorship of SatakatrayaM  
(neeti-SRngaara-vairaaagya) and vaakyapadeeyaM are under dispute.  
Whether the same of BhartRhari of Satakas wrote vaakyapadeeyaM or not  
is a billion dollar question. Me too know some thing about this.  
However, can any body give me any hint or clue to recent conclusive  
researches in this regard so that I will be greatly enriched.  
  
regards  
  
ganesh
