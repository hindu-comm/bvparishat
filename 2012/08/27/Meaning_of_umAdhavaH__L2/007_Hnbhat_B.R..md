I don't think so. To give the same meaning from the root धृञ्

it should be जाह्नवीधृत् and not जाह्नवीधृक् with क्विप् suffix from the same root.

जाह्नवीं धृष्णोति इति जाह्नवी-धृक् is derived from the verb ञिधृषा प्रागल्भ्ये - is derived with

क्विन् - as दधृक् isolated as ऋत्विग्दधृक्स्रग्दिगुष्णिगञ्चुयुजिक्रुञ्चां च ३।२।५९\|\| and the even then, जाह्नवीधृक् would not mean as the same as जाह्नवीभृत् or जाह्नवीधृत्. There would be little difference in shade of meaning: capable of checking the force of जाह्नवी when she fell from heaven, which reminds of the episode of गङ्गावतरण, than the normal epithets गङ्गाधरः which would be conveyed by the epithet जाह्नवीधृत्. In south Indian version with the commentary of Neelakantha, it is the same जाह्नवीधृक् and जाह्नवीधृत् or जाह्नवीभृत् as suggested.

  

विष्णुसहस्रनाम also has two different readings महाद्रिधृक् and महाद्रिधृत् meaning differently strictly following grammar. I don't know whether there is any way to make these two words derived from two different roots, make to give the same meaning. The same difference of connotation is taken here also. The one reminds गोवर्धनोद्धरण and also मन्दरोद्धरण (in कूर्मावतार).

Considering the above, the possible variant, would be जाह्नवीधृत् alternative with जाह्नवीधृक् would mean almost the same, but not identical in meaning as both are derived from different roots.धृञ् धारणे and ञिधृषा प्रागल्भ्ये which takes क्विन्, and also क्विप् as in the above usage. In क्विन्, it would be दधृक्, with क्विप् suffix it would be धृक् as in the above two usages.
