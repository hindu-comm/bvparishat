Dear Parishad Manager,  
Nowadays whatever mail I send to bvparishat either a separate one or a  
reply to some other mails, are not shown and I do not receive them in my  
mail-box. But I receive all other mails sent by others to bvparishat.  
I request you to look into it if there is any problem and kindly  
intimate me about that.  
With the best wishes  
Ganesan
