Actually, reply-to-list \*was\* the default option until recently, and I believe it was changed because of many unnecessary personal replies to individuals being posted. Having reply-to-sender is also a widely accepted standard (back since the Usenet days), esp. in case of forums that have a low tolerance of noise. I don't believe the moderators can be accused of doing anything strange or inappropriate. That said, I don't think this issue has anything to do with the original complaint of "non-receipt of my \[own\] mail" -- I suspect that may be happening because the poster's own mail is tagged and placed in the "sent-mail" folder, even when it comes back from a mailing list.  
  
A courteous request I would make of all is to give some thought to posting style, and in particular to avoid top posting and quoting a lot of text (including but not limited to previous footer, etc.) unnecessarily. Please see <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posting_style> in this regard.
