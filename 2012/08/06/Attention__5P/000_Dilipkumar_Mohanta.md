Request to scholars  
Texts written in Sanskrit should be available in academically known  
idioms in translation. English translation as well as in Indian  
regional languages. When thoughts contained in Sanskrit texts are  
translated into English the whole world will see how important they  
are even for the present day.So I request the Sanskrit scholars to try  
to translate now ; otherwise these valuable wealth will be lost for  
ever. Govt. has many offices with funds like ICPR, ICSSR, ICHR But  
people choosen by the Govt are neither interested nor respectful for  
preserving our rich cultures. Most of them are not even competent for  
their positions.So only private and personal effort is the posible  
alternatives.
