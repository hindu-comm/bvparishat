People are much more willing to learn a new language than to give up their mother tongue. Hence one language will be difficult. Two or three - it is a difference of opinion. In my opinion, three would be beneficial for the nation. You may disagree.

Not quite. Bengal recently gave second language status to Hindi, Gurmukhi, Santhali, and Odia in areas where than 10% of the population, but none are being imposed. Adoption and promotion are not same as imposition in my opinion.

No way. In the past 65 years, much of Urduised Hindustani has been replaced by highly Samskritized Hindi in public speeches, newspapers, magazines, Lok Sabha, Rajya Sabha. Even Salman Khurshid speaks Samskritized Hindi to media.

Nobody is calling it a Hindi movement, but to my information, all addresses of Sh. Anna Hazare from Jantar Mantar have been in Hindi.

Samskrita is not equidistant from all regional languages. Gujarati, Bengali, Awadhi et cetera are much closer to Samskrit than Punjabi or Tamil.  
  
Why blame the "people from the north" alone when there are many more people from West, East, North-East, and even Tamil Nadu and Kerala in Bangalore, who do not learn or speak Kannada after many years? Plus how many immigrants to Mumbai, from North or South or North-East learn Marathi - this is what Sh. Raj Thackerey regularly complains about and to an extent he is justified? Or how many students from all over the country in Varanasi learn Bhojpuri? This is a sad situation, but it is not only the people from the north blame.  
  
One community stands out - the Marwari business community. Much of Bangalore retail scene in new areas like Indiranagar, Domlur, Bellandur and even old areas like Vijayanagar, Chikpet is run by Marwaris and they speak fluent Kannada. In fact the Marwari business owners speak the regional language wherever they do business, and this is the one of the reasons they are successful everywhere. And there is your reason to learn regional languages - a business cannot be run by ignoring the regional languages.

Roman alphabet? I think you are referring to Indonesian or Malay and not Mandarin. China has promoted simplified Chinese script which is simpler to read and write than traditional Chinese. But nowhere in my experience in Hong Kong or China I have come across Roman alphabet for writing Chinese. A pictographic script cannot be easily written in a phonetic script.

We can learn from other countries, but you are write a copied solution will not work, it needs to be adapted.

If we are to compete globally and bring great things like Yoga and Vedanta to the world, English is a must. I do agree we must not be slaves of English.

I agree with you in theory. It would be very difficult to achieve, though not impossible. The Jews did this with Hebrew in 1948 when the survivors of concentration camps who spoke Magyar (Hungarian), German, Russian, Polish, and dozens of languages migrated to Israel. Today all of Israeli Jews speak Hebrew.
