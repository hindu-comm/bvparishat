hariH OM,  
shri mishra,  
  
"I am sorry to say your experience is limited. In Statistics this is called "Sampling Bias"."  
 The boot seems to be on the other leg. Whatever you propose seems to be non-biased! Coming from God himself? But no point in continuing when we differ so much on this.  
  
"LOL, what do you mean by "you cannot ..."? The English word "national" has several meanings and connotations, including connected with or related to a nation - please look up any English dictionary. For me it was a "national movement", with the "national goal" of liberating the "nation" from British Rule. If you do not like the term, you may call HSRA a "Nationalistic movement" or even "Punjab-UP-Bihar-Maharashtra" movement, but seriously, what's your point here in choice of words? "  
 This has been the most non-serious response to a serious question I have ever read in BVP. You proposed that the HSRA was a "national" movement because of its "hindi-ness" and when I pointed out to you that it was limited to a few states, you now want to shift the grounds of the discussion on the word "national". Nobody was ever questioning the nationalism of the youth who started the movement. Also, you seem to be in such a tearing hurry that you aren't even remembering what you have proposed earlier!  
  
"You misinterpret. I did not attribute the success of his movement to him speaking in Hindi. I only said his current pan-India movement reached the masses primarily through Hindi. You know and I know that the reach of vernacular media is much wider than reach of English media. "  
 So, it wasn't the Hindi speeches alone, it was the English and the "vernacular" media. Self goal for you isn't it?  
  
"If everything could be learned from reading Wikipedia, you would not need a Guru or university education. Romanization of Chinese is a a set of transliteration schemes like IAST, ITRANS and Harvard Kyoto. Romanized Chinese is majorly used by foreigners in China or HK who are learning Mandarin and cannot read the script or by the Chinese for data entry using devices that do not support touch-screen or Chinese characters. It does not mean Chinese are giving up their script as you have misunderstood. "  
 You could have just cut out the c\*\*\* by telling me that my understanding was wrong. I am here to correct myself if I am shown to be wrong. You could have avoided the "Guru" and "university education" thing. I am sure you are not the only person on this forum who has those and just tripping on a fact doesn't negate one's "university education" or "shiShya-ness". Your arrogance and smugness is intolerable.  
  
"Obnoxious? Cheap? Strong words! I wonder what you think of Swami Vivekananda and Arvind Ghosh who brought Vedic knowledge to the West in English or French? "  
 again, just name throwing. Aurobindo didn't learn English or French to teach "Vedic Knowledge", he learnt it because he was forced by his father who had packed him off to England to prevent exposure to bhAratiiya culture. Sv. Vivekananda went to US to represent India in the parliament of world religions, he went there as a king, not as a salesman. He went there again on the request of those people, he didn't go there at his expense etc. etc.  
  
"This will be my last post on this topic. "  
 :-) :-) :-)

  
  
svasti,  
 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,  

shrivathsa.
