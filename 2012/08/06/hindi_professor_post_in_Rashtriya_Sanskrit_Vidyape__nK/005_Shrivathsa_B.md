hariH OM,  
shri mishra,

  
  
"Not quite. Bengal recently gave second language status to Hindi, Gurmukhi, Santhali, and Odia in areas where than 10% of the population, but none are being imposed. Adoption and promotion are not same as imposition in my opinion."  

 Didn't know that you were talking about such a situation. What you have said above is a welcome development. Now if a sufficiently big population in a district appeals for samskR^itam as a second language, it may be granted on this precedent. It seems that uttarakhand has samskR^itam as a second language across the state.

  
  
"No way. In the past 65 years, much of Urduised Hindustani has been replaced by highly Samskritized Hindi in public speeches, newspapers, magazines, Lok Sabha, Rajya Sabha. Even Salman Khurshid speaks Samskritized Hindi to media."  

 My experience seems to be opposite of this. I have not lived 65 yrs, I am less than half that age. But in the past 10-15 years, i have seen a progressive urdu-ization of speeches, TV shows, etc.

  
  
"And Maharashtra as well e.g. Shivram Rajguru."  

 Hence you can't call the HSRA a "national movement" as you had called it.

  
  
"Nobody is calling it a Hindi movement, but to my information, all addresses of Sh. Anna Hazare from Jantar Mantar have been in Hindi."  

 You wanted to say that his speeches in Hindi have made it a national movement. I disagreed with you by saying that the English media has driven his campaign from the front. Just because his speeches were in Hindi, you cannot attribute the "success" of his movement to his speaking Hindi. As I had told you earlier, he became successful earlier when he spoke marAThi.

  
  
"Samskrita is not equidistant from all regional languages. Gujarati, Bengali, Awadhi et cetera are much closer to Samskrit than Punjabi or Tamil. "  

 Then apply the kaimutika nyAya. if Sanskrit itself is not equidistant from different languages, then what about Hindi, it is even worse. Those (like me) who will not accept a language which is farther from me than it is for others, will not accept another language which is farther than the former. (hence the person proposing the compromise has to propose samskR^itam for me).

  
  
"Why blame the "people from the north" alone when there are many more people from West, East, North-East, and even Tamil Nadu and Kerala in Bangalore, who do not learn or speak Kannada after many years? Plus how many immigrants to Mumbai, from North or South or North-East learn Marathi - this is what Sh. Raj Thackerey regularly complains about and to an extent he is justified? Or how many students from all over the country in Varanasi learn Bhojpuri? This is a sad situation, but it is not only the people from the north blame."  

 I raised this issue with "people from the north" because you were espousing the cause of Hindi as the link language (if someone were to propose malayALam as the link language, i would have raised the issue of malayALis in bangalore who don't learn kannaDa, hope you understand the point) . You wanted to say that the ideal situation would be for hindi speaking people to learn a regional language. I had told you that when they aren't doing it even when there is a clear and present utility in doing so, will they do so when there isn't even a tangible benefit?

  
  
"One community stands out - the Marwari business community. Much of Bangalore retail scene in new areas like Indiranagar, Domlur, Bellandur and even old areas like Vijayanagar, Chikpet is run by Marwaris and they speak fluent Kannada. In fact the Marwari business owners speak the regional language wherever they do business, and this is the one of the reasons they are successful everywhere. And there is your reason to learn regional languages - a business cannot be run by ignoring the regional languages."  

 Where have I held the position that one shouldn't learn regional languages? What you have said above is completely agreeable.

  
  
"Roman alphabet? I think you are referring to Indonesian or Malay and not Mandarin. China has promoted simplified Chinese script which is simpler to read and write than traditional Chinese. But nowhere in my experience in Hong Kong or China I have come across Roman alphabet for writing Chinese. A pictographic script cannot be easily written in a phonetic script."  

 I had read the following recently: <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization_of_Chinese>

  
  
"If we are to compete globally and bring great things like Yoga and Vedanta to the world, English is a must. I do agree we must not be slaves of English. "  

 I am totally opposed to this sort of baniyagiri (crass salesman-ship). This stems also from a feeling of inferiority complex. If there is anything good in yoga or vedAnta, may those interested in them learn samskR^itam or any regional languages and learn them. What you are proposing is quite obnoxious. Our tradition is one of the shiShya adapting to the guru. Here, you are proposing that the guru adapt to his shiShya. Cheap indeed. What respect do we have for a salesman who comes to our door? Do we treat him on par with our Guru? "Selling" yoga or vedAnta in my view has been the worst thing to happen in the last century. The white-man has taken all these and has already distorted them (jesus yoga etc.). This sort of a mindset has been ruinous for our ancient knowledge systems. This is nothing but a brown sahib and brahmo samAji mindset (what starts with learning english to "sell" our knowledge comes down to giving them only the "palatable" aspects of our culture, in the true spirit of salesmanship). There is already a situation in India where only a few are learning Ayurveda in its pristine pure form. Talk to any Ayurvedic practitioner and he will talk to you in allopathic terms than in Ayurvedic terms. This will surely ingress into yoga and vedAnta (where there will be a situation where to innovate something new in Yoga, you will have to take the white-man's permission). This attitude has to be discouraged.

  
  
"I agree with you in theory. It would be very difficult to achieve, though not impossible. The Jews did this with Hebrew in 1948 when the survivors of concentration camps who spoke Magyar (Hungarian), German, Russian, Polish, and dozens of languages migrated to Israel. Today all of Israeli Jews speak Hebrew."  

 Sir, bhAratIya vidvat pariShad is a forum for ideas. Let us discuss them in all their glory. It is only when we are sufficiently convinced in a "theory" that we actually go out and put it into practice. Hence, let us convince ourselves of the "theory" first.

  
  
svasti,  
      JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,  
                             
shrivathsa.
