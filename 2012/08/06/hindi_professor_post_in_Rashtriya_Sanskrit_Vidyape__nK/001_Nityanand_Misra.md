Dear Sh. Pandurangi  
  
For your information, several Samskrita universities have departments for other languages.  
  
Sampurnanda Samskrita University offers courses in Pali and Prakrit (under the Śramaṇa Vidyā Faculty) and also modern languages (under the Ādhunika Jñāna Vijñāna Faculty).  
  
I do not see anything unusual or strange about Samskrita universities offering other Indian languages (except Urdu) as they are all daughters of the mother language.
