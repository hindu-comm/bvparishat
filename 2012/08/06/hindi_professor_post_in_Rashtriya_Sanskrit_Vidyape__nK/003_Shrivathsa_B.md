hariH OM,  
shri mishra,

  
  
"I am not in favour imposing Hindi, but if India is to emerge as one strong country, a good knowledge of three languages (a global language, a national language and a regional language) would be beneficial."  

 This is your central thesis. Those who advocate moving away from regional language on to English (like Sam Pitroda), advocate a single language formula. The question is simple, why three, why not one? Or why not two (English and regional language, which we are inevitably moving towards. Going by your cricket analogy, these two are soon becoming the media of communication)?  
 Your other apology of not "imposing" Hindi appears just a fig-leaf. Whatever language a country adopts, we de-facto impose it. Something amounting to saying: "I will not impose, but if you want to be a strong nation, you better adopt".

  
  
"English is the only global language, and we cannot afford to ignore it today."  

 What part of our nation's "strength" (for which you propose this language) is contributed by English? Nobody is asking to ignore English. Let it be learnt as any other language.

  
  
"While I am personally in favour of Samskrita being the national language, this will never materialize due to political reasons."  

 So, you aren't talking just about a nation's strength here, you are also talking about strategy. Why Sanskrit, even Hindi has been set aside for the urduised-Hindustani for political reasons. So, what do you suggest, we all adopt Hindustani?

  
  
"Hindi is the *de facto* national language (it is not officially or *de jure* the national language, but neither is cricket officially our national sport)"  

 One begs to differ, I think English has already become our national language. Else, why would you be writing in English at all?

  
  
", and is the language of all historical and current national movements that cut across states - be it Gandhi's freedom struggle, Hindustan Socialist Republican Association, Subhash Bose's revolutionary army, Rashtriya Swayamsevaka Sangha, Ram Janmabhoomi movement, or Anna Hazare's movement - incidentally none among Mohandas Gandhi, Bhagat Singh, Subhash Chandra Bose, Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, Keshav Baliram Hedgewar, Lal Krishna Advani or Anna Hazare had/have their mother tongue as Hindi. But their movements which had/have pan-India appeal reached people primarily through Hindi."  

 A set of naive assumptions. Let us analyze them one by one:  
Gandhi's freedom struggle: This used Hindustani, not Hindi. Secondly, Gandhi wouldn't have been half as successful if he hadn't got the active support of the British authorities. Moreover, he was able to use (abuse) symbolism (hindu and other) to a great effect.  
Hindustan Socialist Republican Association: Another movement which was led by very inspired and great youth, but to call it a nationwide movement will be to over-simplify things. Most of those in this movement were from Punjab, UP, Bengal and Bihar.  
"Subhash Bose's revolutionary army": This didn't become a "national movement" because of any choice of language. It was forced to be "national" owing to the fact that almost all soldiers were former British Indian Army people who were earlier captured by Axis powers. Moreover, Subhash Bose inspite of his towering greatness was a sucker for Hindustani.  
"Shyama Prasad Mukherjee": I don't know if you can call the Janasangh as a "national movement" because what it achieved in its lifetime was minimal. I wish to know if you have any hard evidence linking SP Mukherjee with your thesis ("hindi as national language").  
"Keshav Baliram Hedgewar, Advani": I think this is the only movement which had "hindi" moorings. But to drag Rama janmabhUmi as a dR^iShTAnta for your thesis is wrong because rAma is rAma regardless of language. It is this that Advani was able to convey to the masses. Moreover, most of the groundwork for his success was laid by people who weren't talking Hindi at all.  
"Anna Hazare": Anna Hazare became Anna Hazare by talking marAThi at Ralegan Siddhi. He was able to carry this credibility to the national scene. He was aided in no mean measure by the English speaking media. Hence to call this as a "hindi" movement is to be just simply naive.

  
  
"Given this, it would be beneficial for the country if regional language speakers learn Hindi and Hindi speakers learn one regional language. "  

 If all regional speakers learn Hindi, what is the need for Hindi speakers to learn one regional language? I think this is another fig-leaf. You don't want to sound fundamentalist, and hence want to equivocate. Sanskrit is equidistant from all regional languages, hence to propose that all Indians learn it would have been a better proposition. I am sure a hindi speaker will be more comfortable in learning samskrtam than learning some other regional language. You have been in Bangalore, I am sure you have seen that the majority of who come to Bangalore from the north, do not learn kannaDa even after years of living here (i.e. they don't learn even when it is of utility), then to propose that they learn it when the utility of learning it is minimal to nonexistent is just hilariously funny.

  
  
"Our powerful neighbour China has as much diversity in races and languages as India. After ignoring English for a long time, it is also moving to the three-language system (English-Mandarin-Cantonese/Hakka/Mongol/etc) - many Cantonese speakers in Guangdong avoid or dislike learning and speaking in Mandarin - just like our country. It is perfectly natural and is fine as long as there is no imposition or linguistic chauvinism, else we are back to blackening signboards and fighting over which state gets to keep the villages in Belgaum. "  

 I don't know what has been China's experience. China has even partly given up its alphabet in favour of roman alphabet. Moreover, your suggestion of a 3 language formula seems to come from China, we have to evolve our own solutions to our problems. We cannot take a template from some other country and copy it as it is here. Moreover, what we are talking about have repercussions for the next hundreds, if not thousands of years. English imposition has led to the intellectual slavery of this country. Let us try to get rid of it in the next 60 years, while we look for options. In my humble opinion, there is no better option than samskR^itam.  
  
svasti,  
 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,  
 shrivathsa.
