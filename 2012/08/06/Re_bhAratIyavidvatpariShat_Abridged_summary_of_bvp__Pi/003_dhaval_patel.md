Respected sir,

क्ष, त्र, ज्ञ  

are not letters of sanskrit alphabets. They are orthographic representation of conjunct letters.

क्‌ + ष

त्‌ + र

ज्‌ + ञ

  

we do not have द्व, द्र, त्नetc also in maheshvara sutra..

maheshvarasutras give only sanskrit consonants and some vowels (not complete vowels).

  

The confusion has crept in that the conjuncts क्ष, त्र, ज्ञ   are individual letters because traditional hindi alphabets include them at the end..

क, ख, ग,..........य, र, ल, व, श, ष, स, ह, (ळ), क्ष, ज्ञ

But they are conjuncts only.

bracketed letter appears in Gujarati and marathi alphabet list.. not sure about hindi.
