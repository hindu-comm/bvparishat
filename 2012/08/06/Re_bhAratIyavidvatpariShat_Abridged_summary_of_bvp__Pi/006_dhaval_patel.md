Respected sir,

  

I agree with your observation

*"If it is that only a (अ) is given and not aa (आ), then it needs to be pointed out that a (अ) represents eighteen vowels - hrasva, deergha, pluta variants of a (अ); all the three in three svaras - udaatta, anudaatta and svarita; and all the nine variants as nasalised (anunaasika) and non-nasalised (ananunaasika)."*

I just mentioned that the mAhezvarasUtraNi don't mention all vowels.

By operation of PaNini's sutras we get the abovementioned meaning.

There can be no doubt about it..
