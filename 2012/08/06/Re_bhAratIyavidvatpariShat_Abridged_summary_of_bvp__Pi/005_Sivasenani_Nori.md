It is curious to see that Dr. Dhaval Patel thinks that some vowels are not given in the maaheSvarasUtras. I wonder what the missing vowels could be.



It cannot be lrii, because "ri lrik \|\| 2 \|\|" includes that if one follows a school which admits lrii (I heard of somegrammarian in Kerala of circa 15th century, who does so - apart from which, the beejaakshara lrii is used in some tantras).



If he has in mind am (अं),ah (अः) etc.\[1\], both the anusvaaara and the visarjaneeya are not vowels, but represent the modification of the varga panchamaakshara (Ñ, ñ, N, n, m - ङ, ञ,ण,न, म) and theelision of sa/ra (स / र) respectively. am (अं) and ah (अः) are included in the varNamaala taught to children, as indicative usages of the anusvaara and the visarjaneeya. They are placed after the vowels as these occur in conjunction with vowels.



If it is that only a (अ) is given and not aa (आ), then it needs to be pointed out that a (अ) represents eighteen vowels - hrasva, deergha, pluta variants of a (अ); all the three in three svaras - udaatta, anudaatta and svarita; and all the nine variants as nasalised (anunaasika) and non-nasalised (ananunaasika).



The fourteen sutras encode not merely all the available consonants and letters but indeed all grammar within them. There cannot be any vowels outside those mentioned in the maaheSvarasUtras.

\[1\] These two combine with other vowels as well, im (इं), ih(इः), um (उं), uh (उः) etc.
