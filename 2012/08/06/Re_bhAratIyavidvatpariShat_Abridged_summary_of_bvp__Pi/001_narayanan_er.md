Dear friend,  

Well, we may not hear any conjunct consonant like that as you have mentioned here are not intended to list out either in the Mahesvarasutras, the Panininiyashiksha etc. Whatever taught in grammar is brief or concise and perfect to the maximum extent. While we display them elaborately we will have long vowels and conjunct consonants more in number according to your necessity. The extended alphabets listed in print or alphabet practitioners do training in pronouncing, identifying and even writing conjunct consonants in the way you said. Samyoga is the term used to indicate the conjunction of consonants. These things are understood from the rules like hrasvam laghu, samyoge guru, deergham ca, Ookaalocrsvadeerghaplutah etc. It does not require to list out all the possible combinations used in literature, as the classification of syllables is already hints to their extensions. I hope that the scholars can share more on this regard.

Regards,

Narayanan
