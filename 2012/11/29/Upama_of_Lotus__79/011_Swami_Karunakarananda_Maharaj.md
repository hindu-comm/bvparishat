Respected Sri H.N.Bhat,  
I came across Tulsidas's composition on Sri Rama "श्रीरामचन्द्र क्रुपालु भज मन....." where in he says "**नवकञ्ज लोचन कञ्ज मुखकर कञ्जपद कञ्जारुणम्".** Here he clearly compares **कञ्ज** with even hands and feet of the Lord**.** Of course, he takes only अरुणिमा portion of the lotus as it appears and not lotus as such.
