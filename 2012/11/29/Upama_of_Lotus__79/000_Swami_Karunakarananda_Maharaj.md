Respected Scholars,  
  
We come across in the poetry, poets giving the simile of lotus flower in referring to eyes etc. I heard some say that lotus being *perfect flower* it is normally selected by poets. What do the experts in the field of Alankara say as explanation? How it is a perfect flower? In other words what is the criteria for preferring lotus over hordes of other flowers?  
  
Please throw some light on this point.
