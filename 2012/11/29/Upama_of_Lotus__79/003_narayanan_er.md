Respected Swamiji,  
Namaste. Very very interesting questions!!! Let us take the term "kamalam" and its etymology and derivation. कम् जलम् अलति अलंकरोति वा। (कम् + अल + अम्) कमेः णिङ् भावे वृषादित्वात् कलच्। Lotus and waterlily are appearing on the top of the water, and among both the lotus has got the attraction at the day time which is blossomed and the whole environment of water makes it more beautiful. If any picture is highlighted the background plays a good role in making it beautiful. Sun has good background of sky, but not a smooth vision possible. But Moon has got a dark background but no sharp rays, so moon has taken for simile. Hiranyagarbha and Sarasvati are the locatees of lotus locus which makes them beautiful. They didn't take waterlily (कुमुदम्) as their locus. Having many a number of flowers, it is lotus the naval flower of Vishnu.  
Moreover what are qualities for lotus:  
According to राजनिघण्टुः-अस्य गुणाः शीतलत्वम्। स्वादुत्वम्। रक्तपित्तभ्रमार्तिनाशित्वम्। सुगन्धित्वम्। भ्रान्तिसन्तापशान्तिपरमतृप्तिकारित्वञ्च। cool, tasty, which eradicates the problem regarding blood, enzymes etc., its fragrance, and which passifies madness, grief and provides extreme happiness.  
So, what simile for beauty you see with the extremely qualified for resemblance; i.e. most appropriate flower: lotus, friendly celestial body in appearance: moon. Both are widely used by the poets. So, the perfection due to lotus' quality, appearance on the background of water, which is qualified itself adorn itself and ornamenting the water too, so the best among flowers.
