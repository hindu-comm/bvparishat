It is the reasonable and accepted principle that any sincere student  
of the Veda gives importance to the earliest commentators.

All the commentaries are according to the contemporary social and  
natural situation, a sincere student will grasp the idea from them to  
interpret the same in his contemporary situation to give answer with  
reference to the change of social and environmental conditions.

It is not for a particular school. You can think further to grasp the  
truth. such you are pointing out earlier commentators as Bhatta  
Bhaskara.- Vishnu - Shiva is same.

With regards  
Dr.C.P.Trivedi
