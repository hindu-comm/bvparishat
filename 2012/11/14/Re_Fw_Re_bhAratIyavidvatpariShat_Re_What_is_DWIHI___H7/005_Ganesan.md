In this tread the discussion is about some Vedic mantra-s that speak about the the ULTIMATE REALITY, BRAHMA and how ancient commentators have explained those mantra-s.  
BRAHMA is an eternal and unchanging reality and therefore, anybody cannot interpret those Veda mantra-s which speak about BRAHMA "according to the contemporary social and natural situation"  
  
The discussion is not about whether this or that, old or modern scientific theories are spoken in the Veda-s or not which interpretation can be "according to the contemporary social and natural situation".
