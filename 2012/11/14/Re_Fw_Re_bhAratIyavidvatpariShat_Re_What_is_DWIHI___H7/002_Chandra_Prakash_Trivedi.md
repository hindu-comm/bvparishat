Dear friends,  
The Upnishad are talking about form less creator in different ways  
with different metaphors.

विश्वरूपाय वै नमो नमः He is present universally in all. The cosmic  
principle and eternal cosmic energy (primeval Purusha) is manifesting  
in different forms as black etc. Shiva and Vishnu are his forms.

With regards

Dr.C.P.Trivedi
