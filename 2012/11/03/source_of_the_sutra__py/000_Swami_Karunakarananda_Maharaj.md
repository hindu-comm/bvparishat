Respected Scholars,  
I have come across in many Maadhva commentators quoting the grammatical sutra 'तृतीयोऽतिशायने'. From where this sutra is quoted?  
  
'भ वैलक्षण्ये', 'भ सवातन्त्र्ये''- Can I know from which Dhatupatha these roots are taken by Maadhva commentators?  
  
I have Kavikalpadruma of Bopadeva and Kashkritsna Dhatu Vyakhaynam. There too I don't remeber to have seen these roots.  
  
I would like also to know how many Dhatupathas other than that of Panini are available in print or in manuscript form?
