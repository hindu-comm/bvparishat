Dear Narayanan,  
  
It is not dependent on the interpreter to interpret in his own way, the symbols should be interpreted in chronological order with reference to the context of the verse.  
  
The hymn 4-58 of Rig-Veda is related with the creation to describe the essence of the creation. The building block of the creation is Atom with four components (three subatomic particle and energy) and the building block of the living beings is four bases of the DNA, the triplet genetic code regulate its function.  
  
With regards  
  
Dr.C.P.Trivedi
