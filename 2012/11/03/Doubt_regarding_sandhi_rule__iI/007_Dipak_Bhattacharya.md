It is fortunate that here a prakṛtibhāva rule is available but often it is seen that only the Prātiśākhya rule solves the metrical problem. The Gāyatrī mantra for example must be recited *tát savitúr váreṇ*(*i*)*yam* in order to make it an eight syllable pāda. What Pāṇinian rule exists for this? For this reason, too much dependence on Pāṇini when the problem is not grammatical but metrical may be misleading.

A very common problem occurs when the *a* appearing at the end or the beginning of a pāda disturbs the metre by its elision as in *sa naḥ piteva sūnave ‘gne sūpāyano bhava/* The prātiśākhya just rules the employment of an avagraha. But how could an avagraha be identified in oral transmission when using the ऽ sign or any other sign was out of question? I do not know of the problems having found discussion in Pāṇinian commentarial literature. I found celebrated paṇḍits avoiding this uncomfortable question. At best one could say that Prātiśākhyakāras had written and not orally composed. That would be a travesty of truth. How much importance the written Veda carried is known from the fact that reciters uttered *nagham**āra* when the manuscripts read the absurd *nadyam**āra*. It is the similarity if द्य and घ in many medieval scripts that gave rise to this apparently absurd error. One should not read the present in the past. The Vedas were not put to writing before the medieval age and our reciters little cared for that for long. When the oral tradition reigned the solution of the avagraha pronunciation must have been obvious but when that disappeared scholars just forgot.

To be fair to Western Vedic research it should be acknowledged that it was Louis Renou who surmised an extremely saṃvṛta *a* here just for the sake of metre. That is a reasonable surmise when the Indian system is silent on the problem. That means, after Renou, we have to read*sánaḥ pitéva sūnávé ^(a)gne sūpāyanó bhava*. Not supported by tradition but unavoidable.``

Due to oversight, I made a mistake above and typed अत्र instead of अस्य in the प्रक्रिया. Please read the correct प्रक्रिया below. The derivation is the same -  
  
त्रयस् + अस्य -\> ससजुषो रुः (8.2.66) -> रुत्व -\> त्रय रु + अस्य -\> अतो रोरप्लुतादप्लुते (6.1.109) -> उत्व -> त्रय उ + अस्य -\> आद्गुणः (6.1.84) -> गुणकार्य -> अदेङ्गुणः (1.1.2) -> स्थानेऽन्तरतमः (1.1.49) -> ओगुणकार्य -> त्रयो + अस्य -\> प्रकृत्याऽन्तःपादम (6.1.11) -> प्रकृतभाव -> त्रयो अस्य
