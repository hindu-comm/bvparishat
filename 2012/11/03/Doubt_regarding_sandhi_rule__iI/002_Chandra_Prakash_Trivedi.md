Dear Subraminium try to understand the importance of Sandhi  
  
The Sandhi rule is to save the 'matra' otherwise the aim of a sentence and its meaning should be transferred in appropriate manner.  
  
The meaning is  
  
Four are his horns - four bases of the DNA (Adenine Guanine Thymine and Cytosine  
  
Three are the feet - Triplet genetic code  
  
Two head - two helix of DNA  
  
Seven hands - Seven bonds ( two double and a triple bond of hydrogen) in between two triplet nucleotide pairs  
  
Bound with triple bond - Hydrogen triple bond bind the two DNA helix  
  
The DNA bound with triple bond is moving among the mortals, just like steer from generation to generation.  

  
शृङ्गाणि त्रयोऽस्य पादाः द्वे (पादार्द्वे) ..हस्तासोऽस्य ..
