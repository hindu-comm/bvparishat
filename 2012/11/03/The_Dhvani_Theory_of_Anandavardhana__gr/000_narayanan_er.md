The Dhvani Theory of Ānandavardhana

  

Respected scholars,

The theory of Dhvani in the field of rhetorics and asthetics being put forward by Ānandavardhana through his monumental work Dhvanyāloka, is a contribution of Sanskrit to the universal poetic asthetic studies. The theme of Indian interpretation of asthetics inherited through the Nāṭyaśāstra of Bharata till many authentic works got established in different centuries by different authors. Ānandavardhana is one of such authors who wanted to establish the theory of asthetics called the rasa theory by following the unchallenged Bharata definition of: vibhāvānubhāvavybhicārisamyogād rasaniṣpattiḥ to analyze the works of Valmīki and Vyāsa etc. Ānandavardhana says: dhvaneḥ svarūpaṃ sakalasatkavikāvyopaniṣadbhūtam atiramaṇīyam aṇīyasībhirapi cirantanakāvyalakṣaṇavidhāyināṃ buddhibhir anunmīlitapūrvam, atha ca rāmāyaṇamahābhārataprabhṛtini lakṣye sarvatra prasiddhavyavahāraṃ lakṣayatāṃ sahṛdayānām ānando manasi labhatāṃ pratiṣṭhāmiti prakāśyate. (For the nature of this dhvani which is the secret of all good poets' poetry, which despite its extraordinary beauty has not been opened to view by the subtle minds of the ancient makers of definition of the poetry, which moreover, is clearly seen to be at work in such great poems as the Rāmāyaṇa and the Mahābhārata will here be revealed so that the bliss in the heart of sensitive readers on their noticing it in the object of their attention, amy take firm hold in their hearts.).

Aas result of a seminar on the theory of dhvani at the Payyannur Regional Centre of the Sree Sankaracharya University of Sanskrit, a book had been published in Malayalam language, in 2004 titled Dhvanisiddhāntaṃ: Vastutakaḷuṃ Samīpanaṅṅaḷuṃ (The theory of Dhvani: Facts & Approaches), Edited by E. Srīdharan, Sree Sankaracharya University of Sanskrit, Kalady. There are eleven articles by different authors on the theory of Dhvani. The authors are Sukumar Azhikkode, P.C.Muraleemadhavan, P.V.Narayanan, E. Srīdharan, N.K.Sundareswaran, V.R.Muraleedharan, C.H. Surendran Nampiar, S.Sureshkumar, K.G.Paulose, V.C.Sreejan and E.P.Rajagopalan.

Azhikkode feel that the rasadhvani theory might not have successful if it is not supported with the Upanisadic doctrines. The rasadhvani is dominating the other dhvani-s everywhere because of its nature of ātmatattva. Azhikkode submitted a theses for MOL in the University of Madras titled Studies in Dhvanyaloka, remained unpublished. Muraleemadhavan finds the vakrokti theory of Kuntaka had already followed and propogated the theory of dhvani, by explaining various scopes the vakrokti. He finds that this effort of Kuntaka is to cover up the difficiencies of different theories in the field of Indian aesthetic views. Narayanan analyses the first uddyota (chapter) in particular, different levels of the dominent signified meaning. It is the longest article of the book, as he sees the idea of the dhvani theory is well established with the help of the highly approved Vedanta doctrine. Srīdharan took up the second chapter for analysis and explaining the exemplifications of vastu (object), alankara (rheteric) and the rasa/rasādi (aesthetic) dhvani-s. The two way: vyangya and vyanjaka paths of dhvani division is the discussion in the second chapter. Sundareswaran explores the third chapter, He find that the size of the compound word set up has independent power to convey the dhvani depending upon the suitability in speech meaning and the intention of the speaker. The regulatory structure maintanance is strictly followed in the case of if rasa to be signified. Muraleedharan reviews the fourth chapter about the utility of dhvani, the dominent rasa-s in the Rāmāyaṇa and the Mahābhārata and ideal resemblence in imitation. He finds the extension of the dhvani theory in Kuntaka's vakrokti. Nampiar discusses sphota and dhvani from the grammarian and the Mimamsaka point of view, as both agree with the eternal nature of the sound. He finds the term sphota as a yogarudha-the term which is conventionally and etymologically justified-and criticizes the term of dhvani utilized in different sense by the rhetericians. He confirms that the view points of grammarians and rhetericians are different. Sureshkumar compares between the pratyabhijna theory of Kashmir Saivism and the rasa theory. Paulose finds the universality and the polytuning nature of the dhvani and the ultimate transformation of one type of dhvani into rasadhvani. Sreejan deals with the ontological problems in the dhvani theory. He thinks that the signified meaning dominates over the conventional meaning with a view to establishing the missing themes in the latter, such as: rasa, bhava and rasabhasa etc. which are beyond the accommodation in meanings. Rajagopalan feels that the approach to the dhvani theory should be different from what the traditional and modern critics contemplate. He supports the I.A. Richards theory of: poetry is an emotive language rather than referential.

Infact, moreover, I feel that Abhinavagupta's commentary, Locana, to a large extant explores the Indian way of literary criticism, had given more scope for its magisterial position by upholding the dhvani theory, “the torch of suggestion”, with appropriate explanations.
