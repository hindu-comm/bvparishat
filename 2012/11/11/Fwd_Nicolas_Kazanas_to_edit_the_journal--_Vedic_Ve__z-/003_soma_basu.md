Respected all,

  

This is for your information that the first volume of *Vedic Venues* has been released in the 2nd World Veda Conference held in Ujjain just few days back (4-7 Nov 2012) in the presence of international scholars including Prof. Kazanas himself as well as huge number of Indian scholars. Preparation for the second volume is on the way.

  

Regards,

  

Soma Basu
