Dear Shri Rajaram,  
  
**Thanks for your comment," I find your claims relating to the Indus Script extraordinarily ambitious" "If supported, what you claim goes far beyond what Jha and I or anyone else has ever done"**  
  
You have done a great job, any work on the Indus gives way for further work, I have kept my views after forty years of deep insight into Indus Valley with interdisciplinary approach. My approach is scientific as Indus Valley was scientifically developed, the symbols in chronological order narrate the text for which the seals were used, where every symbol have vast ocean of knowledge in the background. The Unicorn is most common, which symbolically express the evolution of the creation from single ancestor from cosmos, the **U** shaped symbol is mostly common on the seals, it represent the genomic chromosome with all information of life and death in the living-beings. Accordingly all the symbols have been interpreted first time. It may take time to understand the decipherment of Indus Valley, but it can give further guidance to the scholars working on the Indus Valley. I may request to write a critical comment in your magazine with the points, which I fail to point out or which is to be added. As a devoted scholar of Indus Valley, it will guide me further.  
  
With regards  
  
Dr.C.P.Trivedi
