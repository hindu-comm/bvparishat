Dear Shri Rajaram,  
  
The Greek Scholar Dr. Nicolas Kazanas recently has given lecture at Ujjain, I have a talk with him. He has mentioned the Aryan Invasion as an unproven hypothesis, simultaneously my lecture was also there on Higgs Boson Indian Vedic discovery. I have given him the copy of The God particle in Vedas, the Indus Vedic civilization.  
  
The Vedic genetics and symbols on the seals explore Indus Valley Vedic Civilization.  
  
With regards happy festival of light.  
  
Dr.C.P.Trivedi
