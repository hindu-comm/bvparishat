Dear Rajaram Sir,  
  
Thanks for the post and also for the information regarding Dr. Nicolas Kazanas. His article and your editorial notes are very apt and succinct. Pl convey my good wishes to him. I am happy that he going to edit the journal and as a matter of policy no article that accepts AIT will be considered there. This is not only a bold but also a pertinent stand. I wish such spirit rein the minds of our scholars who are quite naive in spite of their continued erudition.  
  
regards  
  
ganesh
