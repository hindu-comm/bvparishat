I find your claims relating to the Indus Script extraordinarily ambitious. I worked with the late Dr. Natwar Jha, a child prodigy in both mathematics and languages who was raisedin a traditional Vedic family butwent on to get a modern Ph.D. in philosophy. He taught himself papeography as indeed I did. He worked on the Indus script for 20 years as I did and we together wrote the book **The Deciphered Indus Script.** 



Our approach was technical and our claims quite modest and down to earth. We claimed no mystical insights but based our findings on rational analysis.



If supported, what you claim goes far beyond what Jha and I or anyone else has ever done. I no of know journal capable of understanding your work.



Sincere regards,

N.S. Rajaram
