Sir,  
Kumaribhatt by choosing to call Yudhisther's अश्वत्थामाuttering as अनृत instead of असत्य , and the subsequent observation of Shree Vidya Sagar ji that in life one has to choose between lesser of the two evils and therefore opt for half -truth rather than either the truth or a lie, may be justified from worldly view but it is still non a dharmik act.
I would like guidance of the learned scholars onmy opinion.
