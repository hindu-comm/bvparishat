## The killing of Drona

At a point when Drona, as the Kuru commander was killing numbers of Pandava troops, Krishna advised Yudhisthira to adopt a plan to kill him. As it is known that as long as Drona has raised his weapons he is invincible to all other warriors, Krishna advised that it be proclaimed that Drona's son, [Ashwathama](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashwathama "Ashwathama") had just died in the battle. It is known that out of the grief of such an eventuality, Drona will at least temporarily drop his arms.

Krishna justified this lie to Yudhisthira as necessary to the victory of morality in the war. As Yudhisthira hesitated, his brother [Bhima](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhima "Bhima") killed an elephant in the Kuru army named Ashwathama and celebrated, shouting *"Ashwathama is dead! Ashwathama is dead!"*.

Shocked with disbelief when the news reaches him, Drona sought out Yudhisthira to ascertain the news, believing that he would never speak a lie. Yudhisthira said "Ashwathama is dead" ( [Sanskrit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit_language "Sanskrit language"): Aśvatthāmā hataḥ, अश्वत्थामा हतः), but muttered "(I wonder) whether the man or the elephant...." ( [Sanskrit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit_language "Sanskrit language"): naro vā kuñjaro vā, नरो वा, कुञ्जरो वा) in an inaudible voice to prevent telling a whole lie or as another version tells us that he said it equally loud but [Krishna](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krishna "Krishna") had planned to blow his conch at that exact moment so that Drona is unable to hear that part.

Now convinced, Drona laid down his arms and sat in meditation. Dhristadyumna took this opportunity, and beheaded him.

**Yudhishthira had to experience hell for only a moment, because of his lie to Drona.  
**

On the above:  
****

**Question is: Is the above 'lie' related to the 'elephant killing' episode?**

**How is it Yudhishthira's 'hell', even for a moment, justified since he did the bidding of Lord Krishna?**

**Also kindly clarify if the above reporting is correct according to the 'critical' edition of the Mahabharatha, if any.
