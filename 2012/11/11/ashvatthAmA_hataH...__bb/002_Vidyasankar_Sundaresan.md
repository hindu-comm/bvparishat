Interesting that kumAriLa uses the word anRta, rather than asatya, to  
describe these words of Yudhishthira.

And this episode, along with many more in the mahAbhArata, shows that  
in many situations, one is forced to choose the lesser of two evils  
and therefore opt for a half-truth rather than either the truth or a  
lie!
