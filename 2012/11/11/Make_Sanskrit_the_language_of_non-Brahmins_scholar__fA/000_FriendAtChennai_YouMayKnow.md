HariH OM!

sarvebhyo namaskaaraH,

The referred news item claims that after the university took over Sanskirt education in the State, the number of students

had increased.

While this presents a positive and encouraging picture of the state of sanskrit as a language at the university level,

lot more remains to be done at the school level from where the student picks up the penchant for learning sanskrit

and related literature. Contrasting this with a news item that appeared couple of days back in the Times of India dated

8th November 2012 Hubli edition that bemoans 'No takers for Karnatak University Dharwad Sanskrit course' vide link :

[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-11-08/hubli/34993577_1\_sanskrit-teachers-sanskrit-department-pg-sanskrit](http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-11-08/hubli/34993577_1_sanskrit-teachers-sanskrit-department-pg-sanskrit)  

  
it appears that there is no uniform policy nor strategy to promote the language across the state or across the nation.

While the educationists are not united in their approach and strategy, a section of the intelligentsia appears to be on

the offensive against a particular community, the brahminical community, as though that community considers

the language as its prerogative. No doubt that particular community has been identified with the language

because of its age-old vedic connection and religious rites, but it has never been conceived nor claimed by the

community as its own. History abounds with sanskrit scholars, thinkers and intellectuals from non-brahminical

Buddhists and Jainists, the religious and philosophical literature of Jains and Buddhists, who have contributed a lot to

sanskrit literature and studies, like Ashvaghosha, Samantabhadra, Pugyapaday Akalanka and Manatunga.

Buddhist scholars first used Sanskrit mixed with Pali in their works. These were mixed in Sanskrit. But later,

as early as the first and the second century A.D., they used pure Sanskrit language in their works.

Asvaghosa\`s Buddhacharita and Saddharma Pundarika, which is a sacred work of the Mahayana School,

both of them are in pure Sanskrit.

Sanskrit continued not only as a medium of Brahmanical (even Buddhist and Jaina) religious ritual, but it was

established as the language of the elite at the royal courts and the medium of all higher studies in the various

branches of philosophy and science. While great dramatists like Bhavabhuti, Bhatta Narayana and Murari were of

brahminical origin, all-time greats like Kalidasa, Harsha, Shudraka and Rajasekhara and many others were either

Kshatriyas or non-Brahmins. I am pointing out to these facts to the misconception in the minds of a section of the

intelligentsia that still thinks and identifies the Brahminical hegemony over Sanskrit. This is an instant window into

their myopic perception that require a course-correction. This animosity appears mostly restricted only to the

southern part of India. This kind of divide is not going to serve the purpose of Sanskrit nor does it augment a

rational approach to Nation building. If we are really sincere in our efforts to promote and propagate samskritam,

we need to free ourselves from the shackles of casteistic parochialism and frenetic cadence of cacophonous calumny.
