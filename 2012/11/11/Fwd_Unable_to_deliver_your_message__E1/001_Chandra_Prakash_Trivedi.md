**DEAR SHRI RAJARAM,  
  
The five tribes and Saraswati represent five gross elements and Vac Sarswati thought energy in the ocean of life in thousands of streams in the form of biodiversity.  
  
There is no terrestrial river as Saraswati on the earth, and there is no battle of Indra and Purs.  
  
I have informed this to prof. Nicolas Kazana at Ujjain. He has discarded Aryan invasion in general without any further proof.  
**

**  
the five tribes of the Vedic people; in 2.41.16 Sarasvatî is «best river, best mother, best goddess»; in 7.95.2 this mighty river «flows pure from the mountains to the ocean».  
  
**

**Indra, the chief god of the conquerors destroyed the enemy *purs* ‘towns, forts’.  
  
**

**About the time of Rig-Veda he has given some clues, but general.  
  
Only scientific interpretation of Vedic hymns can give the answer in scientific manner, where there is no place for myths or imagination.

**The Aryan - Dravid **

Before the discovery of Indus Valley, there was no such discrimination on the name of Aryan and Dravid. The Aryan-Dravid dichotomy was postulated for political gain by the British. The difference in the traditions is due to the fact that in the South India the traditions of black yajurveda is followed, and in the North White Yajurveda is followed. The North is near to the cold hills, hence the north Indians have wheatish skin colour, on the contrary the South India is near to sea shore with hot climate; hence the skin colour of South Indians is black. It is not a racial character.

The Vedic metaphor used for the dichotomy is due to the biased political interpretation of war between Indra and Black demons. The Indra is term for electricity and Demons means obstacle.

The Sun spots on the surface of the sun are without projection. They have been describes as nose less black demons, who check the luminosity of the sun. The sun spots have been destroyed by the Indra; electric current with formation of the electromagnetic energy and magnetic storms.

  

**The Vedic knowledge is much more advance. It was discovered at least 18000 years ago, before the ice age on the earth as reported by Max Planck society, Germany (German news sept. 89 page 25)**
