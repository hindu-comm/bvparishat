Priya Vidvamsah,  
  
In one account many say that Sphota is called as Dhwani in Kavya.  
  
1. Abhinavaguptacharya has referred in Dhwanyaloka Lochana (3rd udyota) that Anandavardhanacharya has taken Rasa siddhanta of Natya sastram and Sphota vaada of Vaiyakaranaas and called it as Dhwani  
  
2. Elsewhere in the Lochana the same Abhinavaguptacharya refers "Dhwani as Sphotakasya vyanjakatvam"  
  
3. More over Anandavardhanacharya himself used the word "Dhwani" with four different meanings in Dhwanyaloka - as Vyangya, Vyanjaka, Vyanjanaa vyapara and Rasa.  
  
These confusions according a few Pandits, had given opportunity to Mahima Bhattacharya to write "Vyakti Viveka" and other Dhwani khandanakaaras  
  
I request and look forward to a detailed answer or a pointer any grantha that clarifies all these points  
  
Also is Rasagangadhara of Jagannatha Pandita clarifies some of these points ??
