Dear Shri. Krishnamurthi,  
Thanks a lot. According to Vaiyaakaranaas Sphota is vyangya or what is suggested through conjuncts and disjuncts, hit the cochlea in the form of waves. Dhvani, as process for the suggested meaning, according to the followers of Anadavardhana is also vyanjana or the suggestion process, which ultimately results in the suggested meaning only. Abhinavagupta explains the grammarian view in his Locana: श्रूयमाणेष्विति। श्रोत्रशष्कुलीं सन्तानेनागता अन्त्याः शब्दाः श्रूयन्त इति प्रक्रियायां शब्दजाः शब्दाः श्रूयमाणा इत्युक्तम्। तेषां घण्टानुरणनरूपत्वं तावदस्ति; ते च ध्वनिशब्देनोक्ताः। यथाऽऽह भगवान्भर्तृहरिः---  
यः संयोगवियोगाभ्यां करणैरुपजन्यते।  
स स्फोटः शब्दजाश्शब्दा ध्वनयोऽन्यैरुदाहृताः।। (वाक्यपदीयम्-१.१०५)  
एवं घण्टादिनिर्ह्लादस्थानीयोऽनुरणनात्मोपलक्षितो व्यङ्ग्योऽप्यर्थो ध्वनिरिति व्यवहृतः। तथा श्रूयमाणा ये वर्णा नादशब्दवाच्या अन्त्यबुद्धिनिर्ग्राह्यस्फोटाभिव्यञ्जकास्ते ध्वनिशब्देनोक्ताः।  
Moreover Abhinavagupta says: अस्माभिरपि प्रसिद्धेभ्यः शब्दव्यापारेभ्योऽभिधातात्पर्यलक्षणारूपेभ्योऽतिरिक्तो व्यापारो ध्वनिरित्युक्तः। This is to establish vyanjana, the process for vyangya and it is dominently called the dhvani. Here he establishes that there is one more (the fourth process called vyanjana) apart from the well established three; i.e. abhidhaa, lakshanaa and the taatparyashakti. Precisely, a passive etymology of "dhvananam dhvanih" what the same process in the sphotah too which emerged out of sounds through conjuncts and disjuncts, hit the cochlea in the form of waves; and that is why it has been said as "hearing syllables". More Raamashaaraka comments in his Baalapriyaa: व्यक्तरूपग्रहणानुगुणा ह्यनुपाख्येयाकारा बहव उपायभूताः प्रत्यया ध्वनिभिः प्रकाश्यमाने शब्दे उत्पद्यमानाश्शब्दस्वरूपावग्रहे हेतवो भवन्ति।  
Moreover Abhinavagupta says: तेन वाच्योऽपि ध्वनिः वाचकोऽपि शब्दो ध्वनिः, द्वयोरपि व्यञ्जकत्वं ध्वनतीति कृत्वा। संमिश्प्यते विभावानुभावसंवलनयेति व्यङ्ग्योऽपि ध्वनिः, ध्वन्यत इति कृत्वा। शब्दनं शब्दः शब्दव्यापारः, न चासावभिधादिरूपः, अपि त्वात्मभूतः, सोऽपि ध्वननं ध्वनिः। काव्यमिति व्यपदेश्यश्च योऽर्थः सोऽपि ध्वनिः, उक्तप्रकारध्वनिचतुष्टयमयत्वात्।  
How Dhvani in four ways?  
1. The expressive meaning, which can become a tool for suggestion (arthashaktimoolah);  
2. The expressing sound, which can become a tool for suggestion (shabdashaktimoolah);  
3. The suggestive meaning, which is being suggested (pradhaanavyangyaarthah);  
4. The process for suggestion (vyanjanaavyaapara) having a shadow that of the process of Sphota, which is not appellation (literal process of meaning), but it is the process of meaning of allusion (suggession or figurative), also considered as the soul of poetry, or the real meaning of poetry.  
Panditaraja Jagannaatha does not contradicts these, but he renames the standard of poem-the dhvanikaavya as uttamottama (the best of best), uttama (best) stands for the subordinated suggestion, madhyama (expressive alnkaaras) and the sound dominanant adhama (inferior).  
Vyaktiviveka is a different approach with a view to rediculing ten disqualifications to the dhvani's title theory. The Buddhist paraarthaanumana theory reflected through Bhikshumokshakaragupta's Tarkabhaashaa etc. has been upheld by Mahimabhatta to present his Viveka, to highlight Kaavyanumiti which happens through any sort of relation. Triroopalingaakhyaanam Paraarthaanumaanam (the three forms are: anvaya, vyatireka and pakshadharmataa) is the criterion. Before Mahiman too, Bhattanaayaka also criticized the dhvani theory in his Sahrdayadarpana which is not currently available. Mahiman has a sincere approach in this regard. Ruyyaka having the mind of some constituted pretext is one of the blind followers of the dhvani theory criticises Mahiman and failed to comment gently in his partial commentary. There a few Hindi and Malayalam commentaries in that Ruyyaka way, may be in some other Indian dialects too.
