If any remains of body part is identifiable and there is a death confirmation, the Uttara Kriya Karma can be done according to Shastras. Gobila Sutra, Katyayana Sutra quotes that if small part of the body is also unavailable due to situations like heavy flood, eaten by some animal, forest fire, earthquake or any other calamities and the news about the death is confirmed, then there is no problem to perform Uttara Kriya Karma according to Shastras.
