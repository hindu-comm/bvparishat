Dear Dr Trivedi  
  
A National Seminar on Models of Understanding Consciousness was held  
from 11-13Oct 2012 at CASS, Pune Uni. where two Professors ,Ashok  
Kumar Mukhopadhyay (AIIMS) and Uttam Pati (JNU) had made presentations  
\>  
  
The other papers were from scholars of Indian Philosophy .  
  
We discussed Higgis' God (known) Particle along with what Rsis had  
said (including Veda) .  
  
Do you call it 'modern discovery' ?  
  
I understand it as a point of confusion where , as was described , the  
Scientists could not move further .  
  
I have , am confident , an understanding of what is बह्मन् / चैतन्यम्  
etc. and can share with anybody who is interested with ready  
references .  
  
The God Particle is not a thing that surprises --  
  
चैतन्यम् is विभु ( = सर्वव्यापी) । it is there thruout the body and  
any part without that is called dead , ie.does not respond to  
biological commands from brain .  
On the other hand , dead or alive , it is ब्रह्मन् only in असद्रूपम् ।  
  
The problem with the so called Scientists is that they want proof to  
their satisfaction and the same has landed them in confusion -  
  
what next ? what is life vis-a-vis death ? what is the Particle that  
is evading Science ? what is Consciousness ? etc.  
  
Hereunder I give the website to see the article of Prof AK  
Mukhopadhyay - ' Consciousness is the One in a Five-piece puzzle '---

If anything is to be explained from Scriptures I shall try my level best .
