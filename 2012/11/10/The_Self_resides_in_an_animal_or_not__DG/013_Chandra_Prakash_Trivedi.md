I want only any reference from the Sanskrit text  
  

The God and Soul are formless. The God is principle of creation and Soul is life principle. Both are without attribute and character. The The immortal DNA is a part of nature and God.It records the deeds of an individual in its language code. It carries the information from generation to generation, just like scent wefts in air.  
  
Please read Geeta 13 th and 14 th chapter.  
  
With regards  
  
Dr.C.P.Trivedi
