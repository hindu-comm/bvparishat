Respected Scholars,

  

  

In this universe, every creature has its own characteristics, Even ecological system is based on diversity of the creatures. This is not the issue that why a animal can't read the news paper? There are so many things and actions, which can't be done by human and animal can do that. So at micro level, the self is one but at macro level, it manifests in all. Diversity is necessary for empirical world. Many modern physicists are also agree with this fact..
