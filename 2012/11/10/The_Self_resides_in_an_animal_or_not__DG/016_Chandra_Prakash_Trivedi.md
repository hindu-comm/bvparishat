*Dear Ramnathji,*

*The Srimadbhagwat Gita is in Sanskrit.*  
**

*  
*

* It is I who remain seated in the heart of all creatures as the inner controller of all; and it is I who am the source of memory, knowledge and the ratiocinative faculty. Again, alone am the only object worth knowing through the Vedas; I alone am the father of Vedant and the knower of the Vedas too Gita15-9*

**

*The perishable and imperishable too- these two types of Purusha in the world. Of these, the bodies of all beings are spoken of as the perishable; while the Jivatma or the embodied soul as called imperishable16-11*



The two types of imperishable Purusha, the one is the life energy- consciousness in the body and the other is the internal micro body, they live together in the physical body, the physical body is perishable after death.



*The supreme Puru–a is yet other than these, who, having entered all the three worlds, upholds and maintain all, and has been spoken of as the imperishable Lord and the supreme Gita 15-17*



It has been expressed that besides these two imperishable, the consciousness and the internal micro body, there is the imperishable Lord as supreme Soul, which uphold and maintain all.



Here Lord Krishna described the imperishable nature of God- Brahma, life energy – Soul, and the ‘JÏvatma’ - the internal micro body. Where the Brahma is the Supreme cosmic energy, which is the source of the creation, the Soul is the life energy - consciousness in the body, and the micro body is DNA, who is responsible for the development of the physical body with hereditary characters, and remains imperishable through off-springs and the cell division. It is responsible for transmigration with the language code, through off-springs in the succeeding generation.



*Since I am wholly beyond the perishable world of matter or K–etra, and am superior even to the imperishable soul, hence I am known as Purushottam in the world as well as in the Vedas Gita18 (unfathomed universe beyond the Solar system)*

**

**The internal micro body and Soul **



*Lord K‚–‡a said: The eternal ‘JÏvÈtmÈ’ in this physical body is a particle of My own being; and it is that alone which draws round it self the mind and the five senses, which rests in Prak‚ati 15-7*

***The Soul present in the body is God. He is spectator as witness and guide in the physical body GÏtÈ 13 - 22 ***

The Soul has been described as imperishable without attributes. It is the source of consciousness, which attracts the sense objects resting in the nature, through internal micro body. The internal micro body is responsible for the development of the gross physical body with hereditary characters. Where in the body, internal micro body leads the life with merits and demerits, and enjoy the fruit of life. The soul is only spectator and guide as source of consciousness.



*Even as the wind wafts scents from their seat, so too the ‘JÏvatma, which is the controller of the body etc., taking the mind and the senses from the body which it leaves behind forthwith migrates to the body which it acquires *GÏt*a15-8*



The internal micro body is the controller of the body, and record the deeds and actions with merits and demerits, as a controller, it is the instrument of merits and demerits, it takes the mind and five senses from the body, which it leaves behind forth with migrate to the body which it acquires.



The supreme Soul - Brahma is without beginning and end, it is imperishable. It has maintained its continuity in the womb from the parents. It acquires independent status after coming out from the womb as individual self. In this sense the self consciousness is self generated in the womb in an individual. It appears with birth in the womb, and disappears with death of the physical body. After the death the physical body disintegrates in the nature, and Soul merged into the supreme Soul. But the objects of the sense organs pertaining to thought and words remain imperishable in the nature. And they search synonym instrument for operation. It has been expressed by: *The eternal ‘JÏvÈtmÈ’ in this physical body is a particle of My own being; and it is that alone which draws round it self the mind and the five senses, which rests in Prak‚ati* Gita*15-7 **theSoul is spectator as witness and guide.***

As internal micro body, DNA is the instrument, which is universally present in the living-beings. Hence, during the fertilization anywhere in the womb, the infant take the shape from DNA. With the first division of the DNA in the womb, a mental code open on the DNA, which attract its synonym objects of thought mentality, if the thought mentality resting in the atmosphere and the mental codes have synonym frequency, then the language code of an individual get open on the DNA, accordingly, the physical development of the body is as per hereditary characters of the DNA, where the individual has taken the birth, and his mental language on the DNA decide the fate in life with merits and demerits of his past life. Hence even the time twins have different fate in life.
