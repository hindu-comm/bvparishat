 Prof navaratna rajaramnavaratna has really understood the contents.If we can find the answer of this question- "What is the DNA of God and soul?" then we will be in position to solve the problems regarding the subject under discussion. In our scriptures we find various descriptions regarding the nature of the Self(Atman). But my doubt is based on this interpretation that if there is conception that "naiva vaca naiva manasa jnyatum sakyo na cakshusa" then how we can say that the self exists. We can know only those things which come under the purview of our senses but what about those things that are beyond even microscopic or macroscopic instrument. Further the question why an animal can not read a news paper or texts is fundamental question. I want only any reference from the Sanskrit text. Is there any text of any thought which has discussed such type of problem if it is so then pls provide references.  
Thanks with regard
