it seems that the western concept is more appropriate than eastern concepts. IN West people are more faithful towards God than east.  
  

Dear Sir,  
  
The self is everywhere in non living and in plants and animals also. The universal soul and self soul are one and the same. To consider the self different from universal soul is ignorance. The human species is highly evolved with wisdom. The animals are also under the process of evolution.  
  
With regards
