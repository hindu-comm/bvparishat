Please leave veda to rituals and Philosophy  

It is not yet proved whether Haraapan Seals has anything to do with Vedic Language I

don't know any code by the name Vedic Language code.  
  
Dear Ajitji,  
  
We have left already the Vedas and philosophy for the panda, Purohit and Baman (Brahamin) for their profession.Only to know Sanskrit and Veda for profession is not sufficient.  
  
It has given birth to Jain, Boddha and others. Because we were not having the answers of Vedas, and Indus Valley became the mystery. A true Indian is missing from India. Please go through the book Indus Vedic Genetics first for comment.
