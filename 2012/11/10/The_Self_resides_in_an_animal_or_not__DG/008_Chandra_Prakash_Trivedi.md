"

To consider the self different from universal soul is ignorance".  
  

Dear Editor,  
  
Commonly the people are ignorant of reality of God and Soul.The seers have described them in their own language and terminology. In actual sense the form less creator has been termed as God, he is present in everywhere, he is the cause of existence of all as individual Soul, hence God and Soul is one and the same. Every thing is under the process of evolution, where living-beings have acquired consciousness with mental evolution. The consciousness is higher form of existence.  
  
The thought actions of an individual is his identity, which take birth repeatedly with evolution and development of nervous system.Where human species is highly evolved.  
  
The life on the earth has evolved from single cell and DNA, and all the living-beings exhibit same function at cellular level , the growth reproduction and energy transformation are common at cellular level.  
  
With regards  
  
Dr.C.P.Trivedi  
  
  
  
There is third immortal Jeewatma, which records the actions from generation to generation.  
  
The mentality and actions of an individual is his identity, the words and thoughts are immortal
