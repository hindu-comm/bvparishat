Even ecological system is based on diversity of the creatures. This is not the issue that why a animal can't read the news paper?  
  

Dear Sir,  
  
You are right, The biodiversity in the nature has evolved with genetic recombination from single DNA, we all are linked with DNA at micro level. The living-beings are under the process of evolution with nervous system and sense organs, only Dog can clarify that whether he can grasp any thing from news paper? He has the sense of touch, smell and taste with energy transformation.  
  
With regards
