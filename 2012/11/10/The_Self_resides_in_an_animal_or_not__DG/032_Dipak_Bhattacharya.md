\<We have left already the Vedas and philosophy for the panda, Purohit and Baman (Brahamin) for their profession. Only to know Sanskrit and Veda for profession is not sufficient.

  
  
It has given birth to Jain, Boddha and others. Because we were not having the answers of Vedas, and Indus Valley became the mystery. A true Indian is missing from India. Please go through the book Indus Vedic Genetics first for comment.\>

These words cryptically despise some professions which are not illegal and some castes. By our Constitution despising professions or communities is against law. The BVP will go against the law of the land if it permits such material to appear in its transactions.

In the second paragraph two religions have been shown in bad light.

The insinuating language is unacceptable.
