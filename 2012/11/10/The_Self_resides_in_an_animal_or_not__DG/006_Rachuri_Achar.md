Dear Editor IJIS,

   The souls are different and reside in respective living beings. Only when there is no soul present then it is called as "Non-Living". Therefore as event plants and animals are living beings hence they also have souls as per Vedanta. As Dr. C.P.Trivedi rightly pointed out human species is highly evolved with wisdom. They have mental faculty which allows them to perform activities at a higher plane. As the souls are different, they can be in different levels of evolution. Hence the difference in their intellectual abilities. If the universal soul and the self are same then they should have equal intelligence level as well. If the intelligence level is same, your question would be valid as to why then animals cannot read newspaper. I agree with piyali palit saying "You may go deep into both the traditional thoughts before throwing judgement". I request Dr. C.P.Trivedi also to kindly note this regarding his judgemental words "To consider the self different from universal soul is ignorance".
