Concept of Self in Indian tradition and 'Soul/Self' in western are basically different in many aspects, for example, human soul/s were created by the God acc. to Christian belief while Atman equated (wrongfully) with Self/Soul was never created, that is a-spatial and a-temporal,..etc. You may go deep into both the traditional thoughts before throwing a judgment.

  

Animals cannot read the newspapers probably because unfortunately news houses have not yet been able to appoint reporters and publishers at their level. Hope, they soon will be.

According to Vedanta the Self resides everywhere. It means the Self resides in every being regardless to living or non-living. However, the Self is only one. But according to Samkhya concept the Self is infinite and reside in every beings individually. In the western concept the soul resides only in human being not in animals and plants. Now question arises if the Self reside in all beings separately then why animals can not read a news paper? Or if according to Vedanta the Self is one then how one resides in all places at a time. In the light of these contentions it seems that the western concept is more appropriate than eastern concepts. IN West people are more faithful towards God than east.
