According to Vedanta the Self resides everywhere. It means the Self resides in every being regardless to living or non-living. However, the Self is only one. But according to Samkhya concept the Self is infinite and reside in every beings individually. In the western concept the soul resides only in human being not in animals and plants. Now question arises if the Self reside in all beings separately then why animals can not read a news paper? Or if according to Vedanta the Self is one then how one resides in all places at a time. In the light of these contentions it seems that the western concept is more appropriate than eastern concepts. IN West people are more faithful towards God than east.
