In this ongoing discussion on SELF or SOUL the following observations may be of some importance.  
1. Though the words SELF and SOUL are synonymously being used SOUL can be our better choice for ATMNA  
than SELF. In certain texts translators are using SELF for Egotistic Self (ahankara sahita jivatma) who has the  
the awareness of "I"ness and "My"ness accepting the Krtrtva and Bhoktrtva. Where as The INDIVIDUAL  
SOUL (JIVATMAN) and THE UNIVERSAL SOUL (PARAMATMAN) are identified with the UNIVERSAL CONSCIOUSNESS. According to VEDANTA DARSANA particularly in the view of the ADVATIC school JIVATMAN is apparently and phenomenally real while PARAMATMAN is the ULTIMATE REALITY.  
  
2. In this context the second observation is about the word "residing of Atman". If we say the ATMAN resides or dwells in every living and non-living beings the mortal bodies of all these beings will be the locus of this ATMAN. Always the LOCUS is larger than the thing that is found in it. In such case these mortal bodies or the LOCUS of the ATMAN should be larger than ATMAN. Then the ATMAN shall be a conditioned one.
It is not desirable to the VEDNATINS.  
Hence in place of the word "resides" or "dwells" it may be more appropriate to say ATMAN IS ALL-PERVASIVE".  
  
3. The third observation is about the western faithfulness towards GOD.
The western faithfulness is more conservative and apparent than our Indian BHAKTI PRINCIPLES. It is more professional than preferential. In West RELIGION is a PROFESSION. In our Country since VEDIC times there has been no trace of RELIGION. We have DHARMA the canvas of which is wider than that of RELIGION. RELIGION IS A POLITICAL NECESSITY IN OUR COUNTRY. But DHARMA is our LIFE. KARMA, BHAKTI AND JNANA ARE THE THREE SUPPORTING PILLARS OF OUR SANATANA DHARMA. This BHAKTI in our INDIAN CULTURE is a wonderful concept of PAR EXCELLENCE. Western Faith is not that liberal as our BHAKTI. The Nature, Types and Constituents of BHAKTI are well known to all. Hence they need not be repeated here.  
I hope these thoughts may have some relevance in this present context.  
With warm regards to all,



**Dr. Rani Sadasiva Murty**
