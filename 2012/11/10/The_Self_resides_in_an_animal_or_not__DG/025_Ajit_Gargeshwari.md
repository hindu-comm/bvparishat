Namaste,  
  
Sorry to answer though not asked to me Dr. Korada is quite competent to answer. This a forum to discuss,Sanskrit and Indology. Would Mathematical concepts of Quantum Mechanics which is a 21 Century science be of any relevance needs to be answered first. You may have heard about Higgs particle but do you understand advanced mathematics and Quantum mechanics if I try to explain What is Higg Boson particle? It is called Gods particle for a different reason not because the particle or the mathematics dealing with it has got anything to do with the concept of GOD.
