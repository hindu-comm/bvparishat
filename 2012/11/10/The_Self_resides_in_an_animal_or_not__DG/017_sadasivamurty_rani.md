Dear Dr. CPTrivedi!  
Your exercise to trace out the DNA of GOD is very interesting. While going through the out put of your investigation the necessity of satisfying the following doubts is much felt.  
1. Are GOD and SOUL one and same or different according to your study?  
There are two statements in your presentation giving raise to this question.

  
a) In your reply to my yesterday night's mail you said:  
Dear Rani Sadashiv,  

You have explained like a teacher of philosophy. The God and Soul are one and the same.

  
b) In your another mail you said:  
The God and Soul are formless. The God is principle of creation and Soul is life principle. Both are without attribute and character. The The immortal DNA is a part of nature and God.It records the deeds of an individual in its language code. It carries the information from generation to generation, just like scent wefts in air.   

Hence clarity is needed regarding the dichotomous consideration of GOD and SOUL.  
2. In YOUR STATEMENT (b) it seems you made an attempt to differentiate The Nature from GOD.  
"The immortal DNA is a part of nature and God." A direction from you is needed to know whether NATURE and GOD are same? or Two Different and Mutual Dependent Causes of the Universe? or some thing else?  
3. In one of your latest mails there is an attempt seen to take the help of Bhagavadgita in support of your study.. Do you fully accept Bhagavadgita or only to the extent of the statements that support your present pursuit?  
4. If the whole text of Bhagavadgita is acceptable to you "Aren't there some statements showing NATURE as not different from the GOD?"  
5. In your present pursuit another interesting thing seen is an attempt to reconcile the Philosophic and Scientific principles....It needs a great applause. Here also while talking about DNA some doubts arise.  
As far as the existing pursuits about DNA are concerned:   
1. DNA is accepted in the scientific field as not merely a molecule with a particular pattern but as a code or a language and as an information storage mechanism.  
2. So just as all other codes this must also have been created by a CONSCIOUS MIND?  
3. Therefore DNA might have been designed by SOME Super-Intelligence.  
Again basing on this assumption further five possibilities are assumed regarding the designers of DNA:  
a) Human beings b) Aliens c) Random or spontaneous occurrence of DNA d) Some Undiscovered Law of Physics e) THE GOD the SUPER- INTELLIGENCE.  
Which of these five possibilities do you scientifically support?  
  
6. Is GOD THE MATTER or THE ENERGY or BOTH or THE INFORMATION STORAGE MECHANISM or SOMETHING ELSE according to you? HOW SCIENCE CAN PROVE THE EXISTENCE OF GOD?  
I request you to supply some satisfactory answers to all these little questions.
