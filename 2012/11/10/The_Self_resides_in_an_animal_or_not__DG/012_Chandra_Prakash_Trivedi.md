What is the DNA of God and soul?

Dear Navaratnaji,Hnbhat B.R.  
  
The God and Soul are formless. The God is principle of creation and Soul is life principle. Both are without attribute and character. The The immortal DNA is a part of nature and God.It records the deeds of an individual in its language code.
