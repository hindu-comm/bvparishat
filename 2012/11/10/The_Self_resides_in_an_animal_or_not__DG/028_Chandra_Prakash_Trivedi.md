Would Mathematical concepts of Quantum Mechanics which is a 21 Century science be of any relevance needs to be answered first.  
  

Dear Ajitji,  
  
I have already said that God particle is illusive term derived from Goddam particle, Hiranyagarbha Golden embryo, which appear in the center is more scientific.  
You are confined only to modern mathematics and quantum physics, read Purusha Sukta and Varah Mihar, Aryabhatta also.Do you know the miracle of Indian Astronomy that Ephemries Panchang with planetary positions and degrees can be prepared in advance for many hundred years without computer.  
  
With regards  
  
Dr.C.P.Trivedi
