Namaste Dr. Trivedi,  
  
The Higgs partcle has nothing go to to do with Vedic Science it has only got to do with Quatumn Mechanics. Thankyou for you fancifull interpretation Please leave veda to rituals and Philosophy. Vedas don't or never asked for an incorrect, misunderstood interpretation. What you have written is neither Vedic or Science at all. All you are trying to do is forcing in some High sounding Scietific Words of The 21st Century in to our Vedas. You Concept DNA and interpretation of Indus Valley Seals is flawed for I don't see any relation between the two at least even by a High school standards.  
  

The phonetic vibrations of the Vedic hymns in the background of the pictographic symbols explore the knowledge hidden in the symbols.  

I don't understand anything from the above sentence  
  

"The transformation of electromagnetic energy in to the chemical energy is the most exiting discovery in the history of life on the earth, synonym to our modern knowledge. The whole process has been described in the wedding hymn Rig-Veda 10-85: under ‘‘*wedding of Surya’s daughter* ¶*ryaman*

’’ It has been indicated through a riddle Rig-Veda 1-164-7"  
I find no such interpretation given by any traditional interpreters to Rig Veda 1-164-7  
  

"The process of the photosynthesis has been described through the metaphor of the marriage ceremony in the wedding hymns of the *ÿgveda and Atharvaveda*

."  
  
I don't see any commonality between wedding and Photosynthesis process.  

  
"The major obstacle in the decipherment of the Harappa and Mohenjo-daro- seals is undecipherable Vedic language code".

  
It is not yet proved whether Haraapan Seals has anything to do with Vedic Language I don't know any code by the name Vedic Language code.  

  
The *Indra* represents electricity and demons means obstacle  
  

Further the structure of the DNA has been expressed through the buffalo, which has four horns four bases with two head- two strips and three legs represents triplet code of three bases known as genetic code Rig-Veda 4-58  
  

Then what does the horse in the Asvamedha Yaga represent. This is the greatest Joke I have ever heard.  
  
If you can find any one reputable Indological Journal publishing your fanciful theory then I may try to refute your views further. Please save you views to a novel I am sure you will get readers but not to any serious vedic, Indologist or Sanskrit Scholar.  
  
This might be one of the reason why many westerners have misguided and wrong Interpretation because we start giving such fanciful interpretation to our Vedas. Any how thanks for the humor you can probably continue it during weekends.  
  
Regards  
Ajit Gargeshwari
