Dear Dr. Subramanium,  
  
The Higgs the socalled God particle constitute the foundation of Vedic Science, the life is eternal, the conscious is the symbol of our existence on the earth, through which we act in the society with our actions from generation to generation, under the cycle of rebirth and death.  
For your further guidance a small piece of Vedic knowledge is here.  
  
With regards  
  
Dr.C.P.Trivedi  
  

**The analysis of the metaphors reveals the fact that Vedic science was much more advanced than our modern science and we can extract much more for the welfare of the society.** Because if we interpret the Vedic hymns scientifically in the light of modern science up to the level where we stand at present, than in a similar sequence we will get the answer of the theories about which we are still in dark. For example at present we do not know the exact mechanism of origin of life on the earth and role of consciousness in the life, similarly we have no knowledge about the rebirth cycle, although we know about the role of DNA and biogeochemical cycles in the nature. It is worth to note that without having the clue of origin of life we can not satisfy the religious fundamentalism in the world only after tracing the origin of life on the earth. We can also trace than the aim of life on the earth under the cycle of rebirth and death as indicated in the Vedic hymns.

With the scientific interpretation of the Vedic metaphors, the decipherment of the Indus Valley seals is possible. For which India and Indian culture were awaiting since long. It will give new dimension to the Indian culture in the world. It will also reveal the fact that once in the history Vedic culture flourished on the earth, without it such scientific work is not possible, it is also not possible that through meditation in the state of trance, such knowledge can be explored?

The major obstacle in the decipherment of the Harappa and Mohenjo-daro- seals is undecipherable Vedic language code. The key of the Vedic language code is in the modern science and on the same line the Indus Valley seals can be deciphered. The Decipherment of the Indus Valley Vedic culture seals can throw a new light on the Indus Valley Vedic culture. The phonetic vibrations of the Vedic hymns in the background of the pictographic symbols explore the knowledge hidden in the symbols.

The Rig-Veda begins with invoking of Agni.

I invoke the Agni- (fundamental energy) who is the priest, Deva (fundamental particles), sacrificer, and reciter of the S‚–—i yaj¤a, which is the treasure of jewels Rig-Veda1-1-1

The sacrifice - *yaj¤a* is a metaphor for the creation sacrifice, and the fundamental energy has been invoked, who is the creator and source of every thing in the creation.

**Photosynthesis - **The transformation of electromagnetic energy in to the chemical energy is the most exiting discovery in the history of life on the earth, synonym to our modern knowledge. The whole process has been described in the wedding hymn Rig-Veda 10-85: under ‘‘*wedding of Surya’s daughter* ¶*ryaman*’’ It has been indicated through a riddle Rig-Veda 1-164-7

Let him who truly knows (here) tell the set down track of this pleasant bird; the kine extract milk from his head; clothing themselves in a wrap, they drunk water with the foot Rig-Veda 1-164-7

The pleasant bird is sun, from where the kine extract milk from his head. It indicates about the visible solar rays (VIBGYOR), which are coming on the earth’s surface from the head of the sun. These rays have been trapped by the plants for the **photosynthesis**; they act as milk-food *(k–Ïra*)) through nourishment for the living-beings. Hence the visible rays of the sun have been compared with the milk and plant as kine. The absorption of water by the green plants has been indicated through the drinking of water with the foot, the foot represents root system Rig-Veda 1-164-7

The photosynthesis is a process, during which the green plants synthesize glucose as food material from the atmospheric carbon di oxide and water in the presence of chlorophyll and light. During this process the transformation of the light energy in to the chemical energy is there, which is the source of life and food for the living organisms. Today it is also a fact that all the complex organic substances are the products of the glucose metabolism in side the cell. It is a unique event in the history of origin of life on the earth. It is the only source of the chemical energy and carbon skeleton of the living beings on the earth.

The process of the photosynthesis has been described through the metaphor of the marriage ceremony in the wedding hymns of the *ÿgveda and Atharvaveda*.

The marriage is an important event in the life of a human-being. Through the marriage a young girl under go a transformation. She enters in to a new house as a wife with her husband so as to produce offspring's. In the same way transformation of the light energy in to the chemical energy through photosynthesis lead it to produce glucose and the products of the glucose are just like its offspring's. Through the ceremonial process and the wedding hymns of the marriage, the whole process of the photosynthesis has been described in a symbolic fashion metaphorically. It is synonym to our modern knowledge. As we know today, through the achievements of the modern science in the field of Biophysics.

In the same manner in the Indian culture there is no code of conduct for the change of the religion or culture, but the European scholars have interpreted that the white fair ¶ryan *Indra* has defeated the black demons without nose and pushed them southward, the black people of south India known as *Dravidic* are the original in habitants of India converted by the ¶*ryans* in to the Vedic culture. In actual sense war and battle are symbolic metaphors to express the molecular reactions.

The *Indra* represents electricity and demons means obstacle, it has been indicated that black spots on the sun’s surface are the obstacles in the luminosity of the sun, due to the charge of the *Indra*-electrostatic energy with the formation of electromagnetic energy the black spots have been destroyed. It has been expressed symbolically to indicate the sun spots. The existence of the sun spots on the sun’s surface in *Rohita* *sÊkta* of the Atharvaveda have been indicated by white sons of black mother symbolically due to the solar flares coming out from the sun spots with the formation of electromagnetic energy.

The battle described between the ¶*rya and the black demons-Dasyu *is a symbolic expression for the removal of the obstacle during the natural phenomena. The ¶rya means well cultured- good system and the black demon represent the obstacle during the reaction.

In the same fashion the essence of the creation has been described as the four horned buffalo, where four horns are symbolic expression for the four dimensional structure of the atom, where the three fundamental particles- electron, proton, neutron generates the magnetic energy, due to the spinning of the vibratory electrons around the nucleus. It is the base or essence of the creation. The essence has been termed as *Gh**‚ta*-clarified butter, it means the essence of the buffalo milk is ghee, in the same fashion the four dimensional structure of the Atom has the essence of the creation.

Further the structure of the DNA has been expressed through the buffalo, which has four horns four bases with two head- two strips and three legs represents triplet code of three bases known as genetic code Rig-Veda 4-58

How the creation came in to the existence? The role of DNA in various shapes at cellular level in the living-beings has been expressed through the pictographs and figures on the tablets.

In the funeral hymns it has been said that *Yama’s* two brindled dogs with four eyes watch the path of man. *The Yama* represents chromosome with the information of life and death. It consist of DNA, the two strips of the DNA have been expressed symbolically through two dogs and the four eyes represents four bases of the DNA, which record the deeds of a person concern in its language code of base sequence. It has been expressed by saying that *Yama’s* two brindled dogs with four eyes watch the path of man, which will have repercussions in the future birth. It means it is an indication towards the fact that DNA and its language code is immortal Rig-Veda 10-10
