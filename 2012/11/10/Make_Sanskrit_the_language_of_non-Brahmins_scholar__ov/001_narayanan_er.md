Sanskrit cannot be made a language of any sect or creed neither of Brahmins nor of Non-Brahmins. Once one learn Sanskrit, born of any caste or race, the maturity and the culture in him/her make the Brahmin, through the practice of truth, morality, compassion and social welfare. One learns, understands, practices and propagates Sanskrit is effectively a Brahmin and no question of Non-Brahminship. Beyond the Brahmanic religious practice too, the Buddhists and Jainists too contributed a lot to Sanskrit in different centuries The Brahmana-Sramana maxim was a reality as far as the contributions of the Mahayana sect is concerned. Aryasura, Amarasimha and Shantideva etc. could be exemplified; among the Jainists, Lavanyasuri and many. Instead of thinking and propagating about Brahmin and Non-Brahmin ways, all State Govt.s in India, irrespective of any party is leading, Sanskrit grammar and logic must be taught to all students in India, from where they can choose between Mimamsa and Vedanta, Sankhya and Yoga, Alankara and jyotisha, Ayurveda and Arthashastra and so on. But Vyakarana and Nyaya/Vaisheshika are the must, and all through the one and only medium, Sanskrit, Sanskrit only. By learning Sanskrit we didn't loose anything. It is the language of the mankind for centuries since it emerged to the world and there is no need to make it again. It well here, it is up to the society to accept and nourish it.
