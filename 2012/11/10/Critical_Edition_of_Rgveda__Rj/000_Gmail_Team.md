Respected Scholars, Nanaskar!



Critical Edition of Rigveda for research or for Yajnas ?  





Idea of metrical restoration is also discussed in the book, “A Comprehensive Grammar of The Sanskrit Language” by the author “Anundoram Borooah”. The book is essentially about Vedic metres. If I remember correctly, the author felt uneasiness from the reaction of other Pundits to his idea of metrical restoration of Veda samhitA.

Perhaps scholars who read this book and know this author if they feel comfortable, they may add few lines on this book.

At the end of the book, metrical mathematics is given. This part shows Indian mathematical thinking long before what we call nowadays Fibonacci numbers.



Coming back to the posting of Dr. V. Sundersen

I congratulate him for expressing his views on situations in some Indian institutions. In his posting he suggested a scientific project—Here I am quoting him



“If this is what a proposed "critical edition" of the Rigveda is supposed to address, a far more interesting and useful project to do would be to record the same Rigveda verses recited by knowledgeable reciters from various parts of India, apply digital signal processing algorithms to each and carry out a wide variety of interesting comparative analyses on them that quantify and qualify such features of recitation as pracaya, the varieties ofsvarita, kampa etc. The technology for doing such projects is easy today and the outcome would be more in keeping with what a "critical edition" should be for a text that is centered on orality.”



I have used such software for analysis of ordinary Sanskrit words. One gets a 3D representation (Time on x axis, Frequencies on y axis and intensity (sq. of amplitude) on z axis). Vowels dominate the picture. Consonants occupy very short intermediate regions. In language consonants (36) carry a lot more information than vowels (16).

Human voice cannot produce frequencies higher than 8000 cycles per second (soprano). Ordinary speech (accented or non accented) frequencies go up to 3000 cycles per second.



During speech production (source-filter theory), certain frequencies are augmented relative to others. So we see frequency bands in spectrum called frequency formants. Based on these spectrographs and knowledge of Information Theory, I invented my VarNavAda (phonemic –(not phonetic) symbolism) of Sanskrit shabdas only. No grammar because Sanskrit grammatical endings and expressions have undergone changes. (See 3 volumes of Yudhis’thira MimAmsaka)



If there is any beauty in Sanskrit it could be only in VarNavAda (not in SphotavAda).



As a scientists and practicing engineer I am not comfortable with mysterious sphota descending down from Sabda-brahma. For me shabda is sound pulse. Some VarNAtmaks shabdas have meanings. DvanyAtmaka shabdas are different. The whole discussion on semantics of Sanskrit words circles around Sphota and VarNavAda. Thanks.
