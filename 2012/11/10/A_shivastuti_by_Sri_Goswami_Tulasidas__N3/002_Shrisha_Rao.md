In the context of Bhagavad Gita XVIII-61, ईश्वरः सर्वभूतानां हृद्देशेऽर्जुन तिष्ठति \| भ्रामयन् सर्वभूतानि यन्त्रारूढानि मायया, Śankara interprets मायया as छद्मना. The word छद्म is synonyous with कपट or छल; thus, it is possible to say that छल is the means of control of सर्वभूतानि by ईश्वर, according to Śankara.  
  
I personally have not understood how छद्म is an appropriate characterization of the disposition of the अन्तर्यामी described in this verse (even assuming the Advaitic world-view). I also don't know what the textual basis is for interpreting माया as छद्म. The commentator Anandagiri does not shed light on either issue.
