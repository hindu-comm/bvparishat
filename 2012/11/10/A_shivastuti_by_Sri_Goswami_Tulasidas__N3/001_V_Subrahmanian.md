This is yet another example of how a work is interpreted by each school to suit its theory. The Upanishads, the Bhagavadgita and the Brahmasutras are fine examples for this. I do not know if the Ramanuja or Madhwa school employ the rope-snake example for depicting the creation of the world.

If it is not छल and only due to compassion the world is created, there is no need for the verse to say: भवाम्भोधेस्तितीर्षावतां. After all, compassion is not worthy of rejection. It is not हेय. There is no need for anyone to cross over the samsara. अनित्यमसुखमिमं प्राप्य भजस्व माम् (bh.gita). If it is an outcome of kRpA there will not be asukham. The Bhagavadgita says मम माया दुरत्यया extremely difficult to cross over. मां एव ये प्रपद्यन्ते मायां एतां तरन्ति ते and the need to cross over by taking refuge at Him. Also, if it is owing to compassion the world is created there is no need to use the rope-snake or dream analogy and call it a bhrama and its removal (in the verse cited by me in the earlier post also):  

##### झूठेउ सत्य जाहि बिनु जानें। जिमि भुजंग बिनु रजु पहिचानें॥  जेहि जानें जग जाइ हेराई। जागें जथा सपन भ्रम जाई॥1॥ 

As you had remarked then, one is free to interpret it the way it suits his theory.  
  
In fact it is clear that for Tulasidas mAyA can be both benevolent and terrible:

  
उद्भवस्थितिसंहारकारिणीं *क्लेशहारिणीम्‌।  
सर्वश्रेयस्करीं सीतां* नतोऽहं रामवल्लभाम्‌॥5॥  
  

Thus, in two consecutive verses, 5 and 6 Tulasidas is bringing out the vidyA mAyA and avidyA mAyA (as cited by me earlier from Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa's verse). In verse 5 it is the favourable aspect that Tulasidas pays obeisance to. In verse 6 it is the binding aspect that is sought to be removed.  

  
  
In Ramananda tradition and Tulsidas view, ब्रह्म is both सगुण and निर्गुण, but Tulsidas always prefers सगुण to निर्गुण. Refer the Kakbhushundi-Lomasha debate in Uttarkand.  
  
Incomplete knowledge of RCM and Tulsidas's works can cause such doubts.

  
  
  
Incomplete knowledge of Advaita is what is at the root of the genesis of various other schools. The 12-page attachment only confirmed this. What is Tulsidas's preference is also one's opinion.
