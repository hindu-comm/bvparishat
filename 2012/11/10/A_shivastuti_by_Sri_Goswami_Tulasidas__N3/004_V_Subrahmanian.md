This post is not pertaining to Advaita. Sri Shrisha Rao asked for a clarification about a bhashya passage and I have given it.  
  
For your objection thereon, pl. read this Upanishadic statement about Ishwara:  
  
'*एष ह्येव साधु कर्म कारयति* तं यमेभ्यो लोकेभ्य उन्निनीषते । *एष ह्येवासाधु कर्म कारयति* तं यमधो निनीषते' (कौषीतकी उपनिषत्. ३.८)   
  
This Ishwara alone makes a man perform noble actions whom He intends to uplift to higher worlds. He alone makes another perform vile actions whom He intends to demote to lower worlds. (KauShItakI upanishad 3.8)  
  
Ishwara is impartial. He makes each perform the actions as per his own tendencies, vAsana-s. Ishwara is not to blame. He is only the antaryAmin.
