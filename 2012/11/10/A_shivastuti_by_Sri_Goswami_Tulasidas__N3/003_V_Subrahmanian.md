Namaste.  
  

The word छद्मना can be taken to mean 'hidden' or 'in disguise' also. Monier Williams gives the meaning छद्मरूपेण as "in disguise". There is also the meaning 'external covering' for the word छद्मन्. 'Incognito' is another meaning in the Apte Sanskrit-English Dictionary. It also cites the Raghuvamsham: ’पलितछद्मना जरा’ (Old age comes in the guise of grey hair..)  
  

A man inside a cover/enclosure (unseen by others) causes a puppet made of wood(in the shape of a man etc)and mounted on something rotate or act variously. Children go on to think that the puppet is acting by itself. Ishwara, who resides in the hearts of all creatures revolves them, making them function according to their vasanas. People forget this out of their ego. Thepuppeteer is inside, and *not visible.* He is the power behind the action of the puppet. Similarly, it is Ishwara who as the inner controller, sits inside the hearts of beings and is *invisible,* controls them.



Maybe because of this that the word छद्म is used by Bhagavatpada. 

  

In His bhashya for sloka 18.1 Bhagavatpada has used the word हयच्छद्मा for the asura केशिन्. The demon came in the disguise of a horse and Bhagavan killed him. Hence, He got the name केशिनिषूदन.

  

In his sub-commentary on 18.61, Anandagiri has said, "दारुमयानि यन्त्राणि यथा लौकिको मायावी मायया भ्रामयन्वर्तते, तथेश्वरोऽपि सर्वाणि भूतानि भ्रामयन्नेव हृदये तिष्ठति ।" Just as a magician in the world, by employing deceit, causes puppets made of wood rotate etc, so too does Ishwara, remaining inside the hearts of beings, through His power of Maya or by deluding people, make them act. That the power of Bhagavan (मम माया) (7.14) deludes people (नाहं प्रकाशः सर्वस्य *योगमायासमावृतः* मूढोऽयं *नाभिजानाति* लोको मामजमव्ययम् (7.25)... मोहितं नाभिजानाति) has been said by Bhagavan Himself in slokas 7.13 and 7.14. That is why the beings under the sway of delusion have the notion "I am a man" etc and act variously contrary to the reality that there exists nothing other than Bhagavan. Thus, छद्म when used in the sense of 'delusion' also makes perfect sense.  
  

The corresponding Veda mantras for this shloka:  
*यथान्तर्यामिब्राह्मणे*, "यः पृथिव्यां तिष्ठन्. पृथिवीं अन्तरो यमयति *यं पृथिवी न वेद*", "य आत्मनि तिष्ठन्... यं आत्मा न वेद" इति..He is there in prithvi, etc. as antaryAmin but they do not recognize/know him.  
  
*गूढोत्मा न प्रकाशते*, *गुहाहितं* गह्वरेष्ठं पुराणम् (कठ)  
एको देवः *सर्वभूतेषु गूढः.*.....सर्वभूताधिवासः साक्षी चेता...(श्वेताश्वतरोपनिषत्)  
  
The puppeteer example is given by other commentators too like Madhusudana Saraswati. The word in the Gita verse that necessitates this is 'यन्त्रारूढानि’. 'मायया’ is applicable both to the analogy and the antaryAmin.
