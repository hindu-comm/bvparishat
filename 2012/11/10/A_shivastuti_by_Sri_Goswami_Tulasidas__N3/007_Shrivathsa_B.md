"Is this Ishwara then also controlling all thieves, criminals, murderers, pillagers, molesters, rapists, and making them steal, commit crimes, kill, loot, molest, rape, et cetera according to their Vasana? Is that Ishvara controlling the Adharmi butchers and making them perform Gohatya? That would be a very cruel Ishwara reminiscent of some verses from Abrahamic religions about God who keeps smiting people and striking terror in hearts on non-believers. I refuse to recognize such an Ishvara who controls (or rather cannot control) such people. "  
  

 The mAnas itself speaks of the creation being made up of both good and evil:  
खल अघ अगुन साधु गुन गाहा ।उभय अपार उदधि अवगाहा ॥  
तेहि तें कछु गुन दोष बखाने ।संग्रह त्याग न बिनु पहिचाने ॥  
भलेउ पोच सब बिधि उपजाए ।गनि गुन दोष बेद बिलगाए ॥  
कहहिं बेद इतिहास पुराना ।बिधि प्रपंचु गुन अवगुन साना ॥  
दुख सुख पाप पुन्य दिन राती ।साधु असाधु सुजाति कुजाती ॥  
दानव देव ऊँच अरु नीचू ।अमिअ सुजीवनु माहुरु मीचू ॥  
माया ब्रह्म जीव जगदीसा ।लच्छि अलच्छि रंक अवनीसा ॥  
कासी मग सुरसरि क्रमनासा ।मरु मारव महिदेव गवासा ॥  
सरग नरक अनुराग बिरागा ।निगमागम गुन दोष बिभागा ॥  
  
जड़ चेतन गुन दोषमय बिस्व कीन्ह करतार ।  
संत हंस गुन गहहिं पय परिहरि बारि बिकार ॥६॥  
  
 Simple translation as given by giita press is:  
The tales of sins and vices of the wicked, on the one hand, and of the virtues of the  
virtuous, on the other, are like boundless and unfathomable oceans. That is why I have  
enumerated only a few virtues and vices; for they cannot be acquired or discarded without  
being duly distinguished. The good as well as the vile, all have been brought into being by  
the Creator; it is the Vedas that have differentiated them by reckoning the merits of the  
former class and the demerits of the other. The Vedas, the ItihŒsas (such as the RŒmŒyaÄa  
and the MahŒbhŒrata) and the PurŒanas unanimously declare that the creation of BrahmŒ  
(the Creator) is an intermixture of good and evil. It is characterized by pairs of opposites  
such as pain and pleasure, sin and merit, day and night, the good and the wicked, good  
birth and vile birth, demons and gods, the high and the low, nectar and poison, a happy life  
and death, MŒyŒ and Brahma, i.e., Matter and Spirit, the soul and God (the Lord of the  
universe), plenty and poverty, the pauper and the king, the sacred Kasi or VŒaranasi and  
Magadha or North Bihar (the accursed land), the holy GangaŒ the river of the celestials—  
and the unholy Karmanasa (in Bihar), the desert land of MŒaru (Western RŒajputanaŒ  
and Sindha) and the rich soil of MaŒlavaŒ, the BraŒhmana— who is a veritable god on earth—  
and the barbarian who feeds on the cow, heaven and hell, attachment and dispassion. The  
Vedas and other sacred books have sifted good from evil.  
End of translation as given by Gita press.  
  
1. Faulting bhagavaan for the actions of people is like faulting the Sun for the evil happenings on earth. Sunlight equally falls on the ga\~Ngaa as it falls on a sewer.  
2. Even in shruti, one can find epithets of rudra as being "taskaraANAM pati" "stenAnAM pati". Anyone can see bhagavaan in the "good" aspect of creation. It is only bhAratiiya paramparaa which acknowledges the existence of bhagavaan even in the vilest sinner.  
3. A tract by Aurobindo may not be out of place:  
"It is only a few religions which have had the courage to say without any reserve, like the Indian, that this enigmatic World-Power is one Deity, one Trinity, to lift up the image of the Force that acts in the world in the figure not only of the beneficent Durga, but of the terrible Kali in her blood-stained dance of destruction and to say, “This too is the Mother; this also know to be God; this too, if thou hast the strength, adore.” And it is significant that the religion which has had this unflinching honesty and tremendous courage, has succeeded in creating a profound and widespread spirituality such as no other can parallel. For truth is the foundation of real spirituality and courage is its soul."
