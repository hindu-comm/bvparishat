 Deepavali message: This column first appeared in 2009. Many like it but some objected because they felt I had reduced their favorite deity to human terms and regarded it as blasphemous. (Hinduism has no concept of blasphemy of heresy. Everything and everyoneis open to criticism and debate.



 Wishing everyone a joyful Deepavali.

**Krishna: The Purushottama**



![krishna](https://ci4.googleusercontent.com/proxy/4ywKEnwlW1DxQkReOsivbB-fmL4MgZMeZeVwVoXzaSGI8Ke7f9QBCG98iccBGF2l906dRw5DxExgSiZynJS_hMZk1AmViDHmtlMARVxoQH5HOuJDeg=s0-d-e1-ft#http://folks.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/krishna1-244x300.jpg "krishna")As we approach another Deepavali, it is worth taking a look at the extraordinary hold that he has on the Indian and now the world imagination.

What is the mystery of Krishna? What is it that makes him keep his hold on the people of India and now the world thousands of years after he departed from this world? To make things more interesting, his followers include not only the bhaktas who see him as a divinity but also people who consider themselves rationalists and even atheists that do not accept the divine. To follow this, we need to recognize that Krishna was both an avatar (incarnation) and Purushottama— the Supreme Man. Krishna the man was as inspiring as Krishna the avatar of Vishnu. This holds the key to his universal appeal.

But first, we must answer the question: was Krishna a historical figure or was he a creation of the imagination of his devotees? Thanks to research over the past century and more, beginning with Bankima Chandra Chatterjee, it is possible to say that Krishna was indeed a historical figure who lived some five thousand years ago and whose life can be reconstructed in essentials. He is mentioned in many ancient works, several of which have nothing to do with religion or historical tradition.

Krishna was a key figure in the Mahabharata War though he remained a non-combatant. Panini, in his ancient work on Sanskrit grammar Ashtadhyayi, mentions Vasudeva (Krishna) and Arjuna as well as several other Mahabharata figures like Kunti, Yudhishtira and Nakula. He mentions also the Mahabharata War. Ashwalayana, another ancient writer, mentions the Mahabharata along with Vaishampayana, who first recited it in the presence of Janamejaya. The Chandogya Upanishad also mentions Krishna-Devakiputra (Krishna, Son of Devaki). There are many other references in the Vedic and Buddhist literature. Unlike the Mahabharata, the Bhagavata and the other Puranas, these are not part of the Itihasa-Purana literature concerned with the worship of Krishna. The only reason they mention him at all is because of familiarity, which shows that Krishna must already have been a famous figure.

**Ancient records**

As far as the date of Krishna is concerned, tradition has always held that he lived at the end of the Dwapara Yuga and that Kali Yuga began with his death. This date is taken to be 3102 BC. Until recently, this date was thought to be impossible because scholars held that the invading Vedic Aryans came to India only after 1500 BC. Before the discovery of the Harappan (or the Indus Valley) Civilization, it was held that there was no civilization in India prior to that date. But now many scholars are beginning to recognize that the Harappan Civilization was itself Vedic and there was no Aryan invasion. Thus, tradition places Krishna and the Mahabharata War in what we now call the Early Harappan period.

**Science**

This date can be supported both by science and literature. We have astronomical statements in Ashwalayana’s work that allow us to place the Mahabharata War, and therefore Krishna, in the centuries around 3000 BC. Greek records of the time of Alexander also tell us that the Indian Heracles (Hari-Krishna), who was greatly honored by the Shurasenas of Methora (Mathura) lived 138 generations before Alexander’s contemporary Sandracottos (Chandragupta). Taking 20 years per generation places Krishna 2760 years before Alexander or about 3080 BC. This is in remarkably close agreement with the traditional date of 3102 BC for the Mahabharata War.

More recently the U.S. based astrophysicist Narahari Achar has shown that there is enough astronomical data in the Mahabharata to conclude that the eighteen-day Mahabharata War took place in 3067 BC. Professor Achar has used the latest planetarium software based on NASA models of celestial mechanics. All these support a date of around 3100 BC for the War and therefore for Krishna.

**Man and sage of Vedanta**

Next, to understand the appeal that Krishna has had from his times to our own, we must recognize that in his time, Vedanta offered a rational way of looking at the world just as science does today. The greatness of Krishna lay in the fact that he was not only a great teacher, but also supremely great as a human being, who always strove to protect dharma. This made him Purushottama. His contemporaries like Bhisma and Veda Vyasa explained it in Vedantic terms. According to Vedanta every living being is endowed with both divine (daivic) and demonic (asuric) traits. The Bhagavadgita has a chapter on this. They saw that a Purushottama like Krishna must be dominated by daivic traits.

This is the meaning of Krishna (or Rama) for that matter being seen as avatars (incarnations) of God. It means that in life and teachings they were guided by daivic or divine traits and concepts. This is a perfectly rational, even scientific view. There is nothing supernatural about it.

Later followers of Krishna lacked this Vedantic view, but saw him as a supernatural figure and therefore a God. They translated his daivic traits into supernatural powers. So Krishna the Supreme Man became Krishna the God who could work miracles. No matter how we view him, God or Purushottama, Krishna remains an inspiration for all.
