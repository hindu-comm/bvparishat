Last month there was a discussion in this forum on 'Organ Donation'.
Here is a news report from Bangalore dated 6th December 2012:

// Pejawar Math seer Vishvesvara Tirtha said that it was unfortunate that most miss a chance to donate an organ because of the false belief that donation is prohibited by religion.

He said that it was wrong to believe that a dead person’s body without vital organs is incomplete and hence, the dead person cannot rest in peace. “The scriptures say that if you donate money in this lifetime, you will get more in the next birth. Organ donation should also be considered in a similar way. If you donate organs to a needy person and save his life, you will be born without any ailments in your next birth,” the seer said. //
