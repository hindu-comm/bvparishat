Namaste,  
  
Veda gives hints in very Sookshma manner. Dharma-Shaastrakartaas experiment it on society & formulate into Dharma-Shaastraas. Anga Daana has been prohibited according to Vaidhika-Bhauta-Shaastra, Vaidhika-Nyaaya-Shaastra, Dharma-Shaastra. Organ donation is purely a cunning business hosted by foreign agencies with hidden agenda & most of the medical practitioners blindly follow the names of big bosses.  
  
There will be a day when Science itself will declare that organ & blood kind of donations are useless, we have found more advanced & safe technique to develop the spoiled organ tissues!! We have to wait with respect to Kaala + Dharma to come into action.  
  
Veda won't give us list of mistakes we do every day. In a single word it tells all the mistakes done knowingly, in a day. Nyaaya Sutrakaaraas expanded it and found the formula to calculate those mistakes in Society. At present Kaala it is said that the most of the human knowingly does 24,000 mistakes !! Khandana of Artha-Vaada is  
done in initial sutras of Meemaansa itself. Vedas are not in Sanskrit, its in Brahmi!!  
  
So I wish to move ahead with Rishis to understand 6 different encodings by 10 different ways of Veda-PaaTa vidhi. After this we will get access to 14 different Vidhyaas of Veda, among which "Dharma" is one. So Dharmaadharma Vivechanaa is at very high level. If any one really wants the Shruti Aadhaara for the prohibition of organ donation you are welcome to get it by only face to face mode of discussion.  
  
One more point is that we never required selling & buying of organs as done now. We had several medical techniques to recover the spoiled tissues or organs. Original "Shalya-Tantra" is one among them which helps in treating any Jeevi by doing Bhedha of Bhaadhita Anga in the virtue of Shalya and create "Pratyanga" without any sensation of pain, without affects of Anesthesia!!
