When there is contradiction of opinion between the श्रुति and स्मृति, the opinion of श्रुति is accepted as the final verdict. When the topic is available in स्मृति, and is not contradictory to or approved by the श्रुति as it is left out in the available श्रुति-s, there is nothing wrong in accepting the स्मृति as the final opinion. And so with पुराण-s which elaborate the themes of श्रुति, along with इतिहास, they are also to be accepted as valid authorities, unless explicitly prohibited in any of the available स्मृति-s or श्रुति-s. This is general principle of validity of their प्रमाण-s according to the tradition.

  

Individually one may stick to Vdic injunctions or prohibitions. That is their preference, assuming they know all the extant or extinct Vedic branches and do not accept any स्मृति or anything else, who recorded from their memory of the lost branches of वेद-s also for which they are called as such. Regarding this, the general purpose of इतिहास and पुराण,  

  

"इतिहासपुराणाभ्यां वेदार्थमुपबृंहयेत्।"

  

makes their objective specific traditionally accepted as valid testimony for any topic.
