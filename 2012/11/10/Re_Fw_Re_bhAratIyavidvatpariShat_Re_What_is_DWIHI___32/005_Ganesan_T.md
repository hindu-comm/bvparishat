While Samkara lived in the 8th century and Madhusudana, in the 16th century, (and the Kavindracharya list which is still later, 17th century), there were no known commentaries before Madhusudana sarasvati or references to Dasasloki as a work of Samkara, either within the tradition or outside.  
Hence such texts cannot definitely be on par with the Bhashya-s of Samkara.  
Therefore, one cannot argue about Samkara's views on such moot points on the basis of this and other such texts.  
  
Moreover, as accepted by you, Siva does not refer to the personal God in these usages found in such texts, thus shutting down any chance on conjectures over "Hari-Hara a-bheda".  
  
But I would add a caveat: As I have been saying and as I have said so in an earlier thread some time back with textual support (which I do not want to repeat them all again here), in the Gitabhashya Samkara never conceals his Vaishnava leanings.  
  
To sum up:  

1.  Samkara does not hold the a-bheda of Hara and Hari in any of his
    writings (the various Bhashya-s and in the umpteen number of
    ascribed texts). 2.  But, at the same time on the contrary, at many places in his various
    commentaries, he shows his strong Vaishnava leanings to the extent
    of overlooking and not taking cognisance of clear Saiva views.

As an aside, if the usage of the epithet नरकान्तक in the Vivekachudamani does not refer to the consort of Lakshmi, then what does it refer to ?

It can mean either the 'killer (antaka) of the Naraka\[asura\], which is a Puranic story known to many of us (and in memory of which Deepavali is celebrated every year, at least in Tamilnadu); or it may mean, 'he who destroys (antaka) the \[misery of dwelling in\] the hell (naraka) \[of his devotees\]. These are clearly based on the concept of a personal God. Thus in either way Samkara's usage of नरकान्तक in Vivekachudamani adds support to my above mentioned view that Samkara never conceals his Vaishnava leanings in any of his writings. The same argument for the usage of "नारायण" also.  

Ganesan
