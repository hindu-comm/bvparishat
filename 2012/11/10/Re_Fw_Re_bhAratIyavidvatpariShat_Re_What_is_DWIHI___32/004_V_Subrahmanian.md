While I am not saying that the Dashashloki supports the stated view of Shankaracharya, regarding the 'ascribing' to Shankara some works, it may be noted that Madhusudana Saraswati in his commentary 'siddhAntabindu' to the Dashashloki has acknowledged it as the work of Shankara. He has also acknowledged the Brahmasutra bashya, the Bhagavadgita commentary as that of Shankara.  
I had noticed that works like शतश्लोकी, स्वात्मनिरूपणम्, विवेकचूडामणिः are listed in the Kavindracharya list of the early 17th century as those of Shankara.  
  
Apart from traditional prasiddhi there is no way one can decisively say that even the prasthAnatraya commentaries are that of Shankara.  
  
For the information of Shri Palit, the word 'shivaH' of the DashashlokI has been commented as 'AnandasvarUpa' by Madhusudana.  
  
In the Vivekachudamani we have a verse नारायणोऽहं नरकान्तकोऽहम्....where it would hardly be correct to think the name 'nAraayaNa' means the Lord who is the consort of Lakshmi. In Advaita expressions like नारायणोऽहं , शिवोऽहम् do not refer to the personal God.
