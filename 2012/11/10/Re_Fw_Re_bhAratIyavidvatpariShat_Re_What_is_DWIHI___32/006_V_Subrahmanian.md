Over and above what has already been said, here are two more citations from Shankara's Brahmasutra bhashya which go against the ill-conceived contention that Shankara has 'strong Vaishnava leanings':  
  
Shankara says in the Sutra bhashya: स्यात् परमेश्वरस्यापि इच्छावशात् मायामयं रूपं साधकानुग्रहार्थम्. Ishwara can take any form He pleases, thru Maya, in order to bless, help, an aspirant. So, that form is not absolute; it is purpose-specific and person-specific. There is no ultimate reality to these; they operate in the avidya-projected vyavahara.  
  
Whether it is Shiva or Vishnu or Devi form it is not absolute for Shankara.  
  
Shankara quotes in the sutra bhashya another verse of Vyasa from the Vishnupuranam (?) or Mahabharatha :  
  
माया ह्येषा मया सृष्टा यन्मां पश्यसि नारद ।  
सर्वभूतगुणैर्युक्तं *मैवं मां ज्ञातुमर्हसि* ॥   
  
\[Showing His vishwarupa to Narada He says: This is My form created by Me out of Maya. *You aught not to know Me as endowed with all this.*\]
The message is: In My absolute Nature I am devoid of any of these forms. And these forms include all the forms of gods, humans, etc. None of these is Brahman.  
  
When Shankara quotes Vishnu Himself as saying His own forms are mAyAmayam, there can be no room to ascribe any kind of 'leanings' to Shankara with reference to Gods.  
  
Even otherwise, it is perfectly alright in Advaita for someone to have an 'iShTadevatA'; it does not come in the way of the philosophy.
