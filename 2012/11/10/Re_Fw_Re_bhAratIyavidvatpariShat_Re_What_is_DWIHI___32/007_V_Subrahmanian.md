Surely bhashya-s are different from prakaraNa grantha-s. The latter might not have been commented upon for a long time.

The moot points center around the philosophy. The prakaraNa texts do not differ from the bhashya-s on that ground.

There is no rule that Shankara should have explicitly stated Hari and Hara are one to express His abheda bhAva. Yet He does, for example, in the mAyApanchakam:  

विधिहरिहरभेदमप्यखण्डे

बत विरचय्य बुधानपि प्रकामम् ।

भ्रमयति हरिहरविभेदभावान्

अघटितघटनापटीयसी माया ॥५॥

  
His individual texts addressed to both these deities and holding them as Supreme in those works are enough proof to show that for Him the two were only different forms of Para brahman. Even Ganapathi and Subrahmanya are held as the Supreme in the respective stotras.

There is nothing surprising here as the Bhagavadgita is a teaching coming from Krishna, an incarnation of Vishnu. There were no such special occasions in the Upanishad and Brahmasutras for expressing Vaishnava leanings. Yet Shankara has used the popular analogy of 'sAligrAme viShnubuddhi'. In the antaryAmi brAhmaNam of the Br.Upanishad, Shankara says the antaryAmi is 'nArAyaNAkhyaH'. This could give one an impression that He is Vaishnava (saguNa). But the term nArAyaNa has etymological meanings like नराणां जीवनाम् अयनम् आश्रयस्थानम् , etc. derived variously. nArA is the world of sentient and insentient beings and ayanam is the ground/adhiShThaanam/abode of this. It can also be nArA ayanam yasya saH to denote the immanent nature of Brahman. For the purpose intended by Shankara this etymological sense was enough. If the word 'shiva' bears the same meanings, then even if Shankara had used it, fine. It will not make Him a Shaiva in the popular sense. As I had pointed out, in the Kathopanishad bhashya for तद्विष्णोः परमं पदम् the commentary is विष्णोः व्यापनशीलस्य परमुत्कृष्टं पदम् . And vishNu is an epithet of Shiva also just as Shiva is of Vishnu. Clearly Shankara is not referring to the शंखचक्रगदाधारिन् here.

Shankara has refuted, in part, the pAncharAtra (vaishnava) school and the pAshupata mata too in the Brahmasutra bhashya.

naraka simply means in this context the body-mind complex/samsara born out of ignorance. It is avidyA, in both its kAraNa and kArya forms. By realizing oneself as the nArAyaNa, the adhiShThAnam of everything, one puts an end to the naraka called samsara. That is all the analogy means. The purAnic description of a personal God and an asura called naraka and his slaying is only an allegorical representation of the philosophical teaching.
