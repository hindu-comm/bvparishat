Dear Friend,  
Where is the *a-bheda-buddhi in Hara and Hari * in the passage of Samkara you have cited?  
From none of his Bhashya-s (on the Brahmasutra-s and the Upanishad-s) can one say that Samkara "was himself a devotee of Bhagavan Sankara".  
On the contrary, one can cite so many passages to show that he was a staunch devotee of Vishnu only for which there are so many evidences from his commentaries.   
I will be glad to know any Bhashya passage of Samkara where one can say that he was devotee of Bhagavan Samkara.  
Ganesan
