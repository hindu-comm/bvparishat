Dear Narayanan,

  

Please try to correct the typo error or grammar error in the messages. As they cannot make the meaning of either what they type or the grammatical status, they are making queries:

  

Here is the correct version without typo error  
  

*सोमसूर्योपरागे च पुष्यार्कादिसमागमे*\|

योऽनुत्तममिदं स्तोत्रमष्टोत्तरशतं जपेत् \|

भूतप्रेतपिशाचादिपीडा तस्य न जायते \|\|२६\|\|  

  

from the Raghavendra Stotra he seems to have been reciting daily, but with/without knowledge of grammar or in this case the techical meaning of उपराग with the referred constellar position:

  

as it is clear for us with the knowledge of grammar and some lexical knowledge.

  

It is उपराग - the eclipse day of सोम and सूर्य, and the the next conjunction when अर्क is in पुष्य नक्षत्र literally as I can understand. I do not have knowledge of astronomy or astrology to explain more than that.

  

Here is one more such typo error in the web:

  

योनोत्तममिदं स्तोत्रमष्टोत्तरशतं जपेत्  

  

which is not clear for him with is little knowledge of Sanskrit and typed also wrongly -\\

  

probable he started with thinking येनोत्तममिदं - so far correct in that for him, but it may be typo error -

  

योऽनुत्तममिदं स्तोत्रमष्ठोत्तरशतं जपेत्।

  

Such errors are expected only.

  

Now further elucidated with astrological and astronomical positions referred in the line. And some Dharmashastra texts on the significance of these two conjunct positions, if one can have access to the literature. Probably the query was limited to have a knowledge of the line in general. He himself didn't know due to his limited knowledge and also in addition due to the typo error.

  

The question can be further discussed grammatically why not duel - सोमसूर्योपरागयोः if meant Solar and Lunar eclipse days, instead of singular सोमसूर्योपरागे which can be independent of the next condition or related with it. I have no answer.
