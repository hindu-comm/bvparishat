In fact, the term माया is self explanatory in the verse itself of Bhagavadgita,

  

मायां तु प्रकृतिं विद्यात् मायिनं तु महेश्वरम्॥

  

माया is known to be प्रकृति itself and महेश्वर is the custodian of it.

  

which follows the प्रकृति concept according to सांख्य and योग duo and later accepted by all, developing पुरुष into ईश्वर, महेश्वर and so on, and its relation to माया. This seems to be the naturally derived meaning in the simple line of the verse.

  

And this itself is explained as

  

दैवी ह्येषा गुणमयी मम मया दुरत्यया ।

मामेव ये प्रपद्यन्ते मायामेतां तरन्ति ते ॥ १४ \|\|

  

which explains the term in मायी।

  

The great Vaishnavite devotee, Purandaradasa, was baffled with the question, as all Kannada speakers knowing Purandara's keertana - especially

  

"nī māyeyoLago ninnoLu māyeyo"  

  

Are you within the माया or माया is within माया, which seems to be focus of the topic in the thread, and he could not find a solution to a set of questions he raised himself in the keertana.

  

I don't think we can find the solution, which Purandaradasa could not find. In any case, Purandara left it to his Vitthala and surrendered himself at his service, without bothering much about the questions.
