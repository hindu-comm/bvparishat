Dear colleagues,

  

  

If found interesting for both of you, you can continue personally through messages. At least for it to be interesting for the members, who look for a comparative knowledge of status of concepts in disciplines, you can add in your messages, a simple introduction - according to Shaiva Agama/Tantra/Philosophy or according to Advaita, dvaita or so than flat pronouncement "Real meaning" or such provocative words introducing your topic.

  

Simply continuing the rat race doesn't seem to be interesting clinging to the interpretation some words. This is my personal opinion and other members may have different opinion. I leave it to the members whether they need such discussions or not.

  

Though the topic in which appeared in another thread and it was locked, now new discussion on the t=interpretation here continued:

the same discussion in the locked topic.

  

With regards
