"*And for Saiva siddhAnta to talk of tirodhAna as one of the five "real" acts, it has to accept that Siva conceals himself "really" and then reveals himself "really*".  
  
Not at all , Not at all.  
Tirodhaana has been misunderstood:  
  
Tirodhaana in Saivasiddhanta is not "Siva concealing Himself"  
It is "the concealment of the actual nature of the self which is Sivatvam" by Siva. In order that the selves experience the fruits of their Karma whereby their accumulated Karma becomes exhausted which is essential for obtaining Moksha, the Tirodhaana shakti of Siva functions and conceals the actual nature of the selves.  
In fact Tirodhaana shakti is essential that it makes the other impurities (mala-s ) of the self--ANava, Karma and MAyA-- function.  
  
As Tattvaprakasha puts it succinctly,

पाशानुग्राहित्वात् पुरुषतिरोधायिका विभोः शक्तिः **\|**

पाशत्वेनाभिहिता . . .  
  
In the ultimate sense Tirodhaana is also not "strictly a bondage (pAsha)" as it is one of the functions of Siva's Shakti. That is why it is also called Tirodhaana Shakti.  
Among the pa\~ncakRtya-s of Siva creation, sustenance and reabsorption are with regard to the inert world while Tirodhaana and Anugraha are with regard to the conscious selves.  
  
*"Ultimately, the "real"ness in the pancakRtya of Saiva siddhAnta vs. the "illusory"ness of mAyA in an advaitic sense is just a queston of semantics".*  
  
It is not as simple as that. It seems to be too much a generalisation and narrowing down the basic difference between these two systems, Saivasiddhana and Advaita.  
For further discussions on this subject we may continue later if it is really found to be interesting.
