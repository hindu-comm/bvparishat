\> Four general observations frome me on this thread:  
\>  

\> 1. To think that being sAkshI-mAtra is somehow equivalent to not being in control is mistaken. ISvara, being sarvajna, sarvaSaktimat and sarvavyApI by definition, does not need to do anything actively, in order to be in control. Mere presence is enough. In fact, if ISvara had to really "do" something, in order to be in control, that would point to a defect in one or the other quality of ISvara.  
  
That may be your view, but I'm not sure anyone, Śankara included, considers ईश्वर an inactive controller for that reason; it would fly in the face of देवस्यैष स्वभावोऽयं आप्तकामस्य का स्पृहा; पराऽस्य शक्तिर्विविधैव श्रूयते स्वाभाविकी ज्ञानबलक्रिया च; यदि ह्यहं न वर्तेयं जातु कर्मण्यतन्द्रितः, मम वर्त्मानुवर्तन्ते मनुष्याः पार्थ सर्वशः, etc. Śankara himself saying ईशनशीलो नारायणः is difficult to comprehend then; might he as well have said साक्षिमात्रो नारायणः or such, surely?  
  
\> 2. If the objection to the word chadman in the SAnkara bhAshya is because of its meaning of kapaTa,  
  
Before that, it would be nice to see it established that छद्म is a synonym of माया, either purely textually or along the lines of मायां तु प्रकृतिं विद्यात् मायिनं तु महेश्वरम्.  
  
\> please note that "kapaTa nATaka sUtradhArI" is a very well-known and widely used term to describe Krishna in devotional poetry, written by poets who were hardly advaitins. Why, even some of the haridAsa-s of dvaita tradition use this term.  
  
I'm not aware of them saying these things to describe माया, which is the relevant context.  
  
\> To protest that devotional poetry and song need not have philosophical rigor is not an answer.  
  
I agree fully -- such a protest, were it to be made, would hardly be the most cogent.
