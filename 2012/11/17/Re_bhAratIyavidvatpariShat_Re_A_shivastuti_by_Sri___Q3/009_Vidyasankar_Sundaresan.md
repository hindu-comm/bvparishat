Wah re wah, Misraji, I was wondering why you hadn't yet pitched in on the SAnkara bhAshya bashing fest that seems to be a routine pastime for some people here. Welcome.



I don't know whether to be amused or annoyedanddon't really want todignify this with a response, so I will be brief.



Please,  
(a) think about whether eko devoyo gUDhaH is the same as or different from ISvaro yas tishThati, and  
(b) check the multitude of commentaries available on the Gita, to find out which other distiinguishednon-advaita commentatorsin the past have been guilty of "equating two unequal things" exactly as I have done.



If your answer to (a) above is, "gUDho deva ekaH, ISvaro yas tishThati, sa anyaH,"then perhaps you may want to claim that"vAmano ya AsInas sa tRtIyaH". (I am referring to the kaThopanishat here.) After all, vAmana is sitting, ISvara is standing, deva is hidden. By your logic, sitting, standing and hiding are all unequal things (and sitting and standing are even mutually exclusive of each other), so these activitiescannot all be done by the same being at the same time in the same locus. I wonder how much space there is in there for all of them.It is getting very crowded inside sarva-bhUtAni, isn't it?



If you are forced to concede that there is only one being who is variously calleddevaH / ISvaraH / vAmanaH and variously described as gUDhaH / tishThati / AsInaH in these texts, then I suggest you rethink what it is that you want to cavil at. (dangling preposition intended)



In any case, do spend a couple of minutes on (b) above. There is a Gita supersite online that makes this very easy.



Of course, as a non-advaitin, you may want to say that all of advaita is just an attempt to equate two unequal things. To which, we will only say, mRtyos sa mRtyuM gacchati ya iha nAneva paSyati.



I believe this alpamati has offered as much of a reason as it can or needs to, in order to explain why the word chadmanA has been used. I will not contribute to further growth of this discussion thread.



Have a wonderful day,

Vidyasankar
