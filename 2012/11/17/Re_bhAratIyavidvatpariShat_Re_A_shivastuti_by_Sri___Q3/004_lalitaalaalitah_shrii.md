श्रीमल्ललितालालितः

**From:**Ganesan \<[gan...@ifpindia.org]()\>  
  
  
Tirodhaana in Saivasiddhanta is not "Siva concealing Himself"  
It is "the concealment of the actual nature of the self which is Sivatvam" by Siva.



**You are talking as if shiva and shivatvam are different and concealment of shivatvam is possible without concealing shiva !!**

**Don’t you accept tAdAtmyam of both ??!!**
