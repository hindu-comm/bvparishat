\> What I think would be 'decisive' in determining the sense in which Shankara has used the word ' छद्मना’ to explain 'मायया’ as not anything other than what has been already stated (that is, in the sense of 'remaining unseen/hidden/incognito/not revealing His identity ) is the fact that in Advaita the jiva-s are already in delusion being made so by anAdyavidyA/mAyA: अनादिमायया सुप्तः यदा जीवः प्रबुध्यते...(माण्डूक्य), मिथ्याज्ञाननिमित्तः अहमिदं ममेदं इति नैसर्गिकोऽयं लोकव्यवहारः..(preamble to the Brahmasutra bhashya), the Bhagavadgita verses already cited on the instrumentality of mAyA in deluding the jiva-s and hiding Brahman from them, the verses of the 14th Chapter (मोहनं सर्वदेहिनाम्..etc. where rajas, tamas and sattvam are taught as bondage) In this background it would be improper to say or even propose that Ishwara, antaryAmin, would be deluding people or would take up the role of deceiving, etc. That leaves us with the only option of taking the explanation as pertaining to 'remaining hidden/in the background/unseen by the beings that are being controlled.'  
  
Even so, "being concealed" is hardly instrumental for the ईश्वर's control, unlike what the verse says. It is at best incidental.  
  
I also don't think such an explanation is consonant with Advaita, because it is also diametrically opposed to the explanation of ईशावास्यम् as ईशाच्छाद्यम् whence ईश्वर is known to be the आच्छादक (concealer) rather than the आच्छाद्य (concealed).  
  
\> From this it is clear that the अन्तर्यामित्वम्/अन्तर्यमनत्वम् /भ्रामयन्..of Ishwara is nothing other than His merely being present (sannidhimAtra) a sAkshi (mAtra).  
  
Such a view is directly opposed to the verse itself, and the following piece of advice त्वमेव शरणं गच्छ सर्वभावेन भारत, etc., makes little sense then also; why should one surrender to a mere observer who is not actually in control? It is also contradicted by धियो यो नः प्रचोदयात् also. These all indicate कर्तृत्व in a primary sense, not mere साक्षित्व.

These are not from the best source, as already noted by Dr. Bhat; anyway, by relying on this we would also be back to saying that the ईश्वर controls all by deceit (which is the meaning in common), which you have already repudiated.
