That 'mAyA' is the real power (parigraha shakti) of Siva by which He  
creates and sustains the entire universe becomes evident from this Gita  
Verse.  
As held by the Saivasiddhanta system, and as clearly stated in the  
TattvaprakAsha of Bhoja,  
कर्माण्यवेक्ष्य शम्भुर्मायां विक्षोभ्य शक्तिभिः स्वाभिः ।  
प्रतिपुरुषं भोगार्थं वपूंषि करणानि चाधत्ते ॥ (v. 40)  
  
Siva through His secondary Power 'mAyA' creates everything for the  
selves by activating the material principle 'mAyA' which is fully under  
His control through His inseparable primary 'Shakti' .  
Siva possesses His inseparable Sakti which is 'ज्ञानक्रियास्वभाव' and as  
such the five acts --creation, sustenance, etc. and finally granting  
'moksha' are all real acts of Siva.  
  
Also 'mAyA' is never an illusion or unreal; it is a 'real' material  
principle.  
Again Bhoja says,  
माया च वस्तुरूपा मूलं विश्वस्य नित्या सा ॥  
Only through this explanation the correct meaning of the Gita verse  
becomes clear and direct.  
All other explanations using छद्मना, etc. do not appear to be direct and  
amount to stretching the text beyond its limit.
