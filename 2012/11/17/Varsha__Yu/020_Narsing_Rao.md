Since Bhattabaskara says वर्षेण वृद्धम् and not वर्षया वृद्धम् , I presume he is using वर्ष to mean संवत्सर. My understanding is that it means the season only in स्त्रीलिङ्ग.  
  
Also, फिषोऽन्त उदात्तः seems too general to be of much use as there are too many exceptions. Furthermore the approach of the phit sutras is quite different from Panini as they do not distinguish between pratipadika and pratyaya svara. I am not an expert on this, but it looks like Panini's sutras are much more detailed in this respect. I don't know if there are conflicts between Panini's sutras and the Phit sutras.  
  
Thanks,
