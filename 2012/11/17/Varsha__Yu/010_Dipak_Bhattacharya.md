Dear Dr. Narayanan,

  
This was pointed to by me in a previous mail. But please note that it does not solve the problem of antodāttatā. The sūtra just rules the option of gender and not anything related to svara. One cannot deny that Bhaṭṭabhāskara was erroneous.  
I think debates on how a form could appear in the Vedas in spite of Pāṇini ruling otherwise are fruitless. Pāṇini had received the Vedic forms. There might be various reasons for a Vedic form not conforming to his rule. He (and the two other Great Grammarians) could have just missed it. This can be proved. See below. Or he could just have his *vyatyayo bahulam* (3.1.85) in mind.  
With *varṣa* there is no problem. Just note the svara and choose the appropriate suffix. In our case *ac* will do. Apparently, Bhaṭṭabhāskara himself created the problem which does not exist.  
The Vedic svaras existed before Pāṇini. He ruled pratyayas to facilitate remembering the appropriate accent. If one could remember the accents the rules of Pāṇini would not have been necessary. But we often think that it is his vidhis which are responsible for the accents. That way we put the cart before the horse.  
As to the Trimuni really missing a form happens, among others, with the rule *k**ās pratyayād ām amantre liṭi* (3.1.35). We find this ām in the Atharvaveda Samhitā that is mantra where it was unexpected according to 3.1.35. Cf., *gamay**ām cakartha* in AVP 18.65.10 and *gamay**ām cakāra *in AVŚ 18.2.27. It has been shown in the Introduction to the 3^(rd) volume of the new edition of the AVP how all the three Great Grammarians could have missed the form. A Western scholar J. Bronkhorst wrongly concluded that the occurrence of an un-Paṇinian form in the Atharvaveda showed that his relation with these was not close. The relation was close no doubt. Yet a form could have been missed because every part of a Veda might not have been in their access for special reasons.

The relation of the three Great Grammarians with the Vedas calls for deep enquiry. That may bring to light many hazy aspects of our intellectual history.

Best
