But it deals with Gana-s according to topics, naamagana, samasagana, and taddhita gana.

  

  

But it doesn't deal with Vaidika prakriya. I just mentioned the possibility of being left out in the gana, even though it is not marked as वृद्गण, or आकृतिगण which is common practice in the Ganapataha. Particularly this is not marked as आकृतिगण, nor वृद्गण. and could be considered as आकृतिगण on the authority of Bhattabhaskara. Only for that I mentioned the occurrence of वार्धक, which is also not marked as आकृतिगण.

  

Vardhamana, as a Jain writer, had not to deal with the स्वराध्याय in his scheme, as the chapters deal with Vedic examples. You cannot find therein. Sorry for the confusion created.

  

If the comparative study of Kapildev Shastri or his Critical

Edition could be consulted, you can get some solution. That too, if he has included in his comparative study the गण-s from the 6th Chapter dealing with accents. If his Critical Edition could be consulted, that would be better.

  

With regards
