You are right. We have to critically edit with all the manuscripts available, for a fair understandings of inclusion of Ganapatha many words as available now might be recovered.

  

Recently a similar question was raised by another member about the
explanation by Mallinatha, on the usage of "बार्धके मुनिवृत्तीनाम्" by Kalidasa in his Raghuamsha, which clearly means in the old age. To get this meaning, he resorted to the clue in Kosha on one hand, "वार्धकं वृद्धसंघाते वृद्धस्य च कर्मणि" and to substantiate, quoted "द्वन्द्वमनोज्ञादिभ्यश्च" to get the meaning वृद्धस्य भावः - with वुञ् suffix. In the Kashika list and the available printed texts, the गण मनोज्ञादि didn't list the word वृद्ध and how to accept his explanation.

  

By chance, I had a look in the Ganaratna Mahodadhi, of Vardhamana, with his running commentary with examples, and found he had the word in the list and as example he quoted Kalidasa's usage.

  

In this case, if confirmed from other sources, about the accent of the word, in the वैदिकप्रक्रिया, the words of Bhattabhaskara could be accepted, taking it granted that in some version he should have found the word listed. Even if not listed, if the word has the accent he has explained, confirmed from other oral sources or written sources, without any variation, then also we have to include it lest it cannot be explained otherwise. There too, we cannot rely on one शाखा, which may not have the accent noticed by Bhattabhaskara may not be available.

  

There was a Ph.D thesis A Critical Edition of Ganapatha of Panini, in 1959 in BHU, by Kapil Dev Shastri as noticed in the review of Paninian Studies, by Cardona. I don't know whether it was published or not. I remember another Ganapatha, published from BORI looked like a critical Edition, but I am not sure of it.

  

These two sources can be consulted.
