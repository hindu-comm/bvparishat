Dear Dr. narayanan,  
I should add one more point. I do not know the exact context where Bhattabhaaskara made his remarks. The situation would be different if varsha occurred in a compound.That might call for accent shift. But did such an exigency exist in the context of the word commented upon by Bhattabhaaskara? It is necessary to know that. That may call for a discussion anew.  
Yours
