Bhattabhaskara, in his commentary on TS 1.1.2, while explaining वर्षवृद्धम्  
says: ’तृतीया कर्मणि’ इति पूर्वपदप्रकृतिस्वरत्वम् । वर्षशब्द उञ्छादित्वादन्तोदात्तः ।  
  
This refers to 6.1.160 उञ्छादीनां च । However, I could not locate वर्ष in  
the ganapatha (which includes some ganasutras) associated with उञ्छादि,  
unless I have a version that is different from what Bhattabhaskara had  
with him.  
  
Could someone explain how वर्ष becomes अन्तोदात्त ?  
  
Thanks,  
Narsing Rao
