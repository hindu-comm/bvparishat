I feel that to say that Bhattabhaskara has erred is too preposterous. We have not yet

Got access to his sources and hence should wait to pronounce judgments, even possibilities.



We see his genial explanations on numerous words that are really educative and hence,

Further efforts to get more sources may be in order.



The point that we only understand authentic Vedic words and their meanings and not ordain them

Is very appropriate.

Ramanujan
