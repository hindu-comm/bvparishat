Dear Shri rao,

The inclusion of varsha in the ardhrcaadi gana is beyond doubt. As to why Bhattabhaskara cited it in a context where it does not fit into is a different question. Now, if, as I showed, Bhattabhaskara himself erred in giving the name of the gana, he could err otherwise too. One has to find out if the edition of Bhattabhaskara was proper or not. Manuscripts must be consulted in case of doubt.

Best
