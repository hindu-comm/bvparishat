I don't think so. Panini has suggested some explanation according to his scheme, प्रकृति, प्रत्यय + स्वर - like he as done throughout अष्टाध्यायी. In spite of his कृदन्त suffixes, उणादि is not considered as conflicting with his analysis, but only supplementary. In the same way, he doesn't list all the प्रकृति-s or all the प्रत्यय-s individually, for explaining the accents, but laid down a process in general. फ़िट्सूत्र need not be conflicting with the explanations by Panini, as it is cleared in Kashika, भावघञ् and करणघञ् are specially analyzed for the samples at hand, while फ़िट्सूत्र-s are of general nature. Some may be included in the analysis of Panini and undergone some changes.



I don't think there is any conflict between the accessories.

सम्यगुक्तम् ।



वेदवेगवेष्टबन्धाः करणे इत्यादीनां स्वरमञ्जर्यादिषु विस्तरेण प्रतिपादनं तैत्तिरीये ऋग्वेदे च दृश्यते ।

स्थालीपुलाकन्यायेन केवलं वेदशब्दे गृहीते,

सः करणे अन्तोदात्तः, दर्भमुष्ट्यर्थकः । प्रजापतेर्वा एतानि श्मश्रूणि । यद्वे॒दः । इत्यादाविव ।

अनन्ता वै वेदाः इत्यत्र आद्युदात्तः भावघञाश्रित्य ।

Rest is left to a thorough understanding of the all the words of Veda-s under the स्वरप्रक्रिया and not simply taking up some सूत्र-s we can understand and have access to, to judge the opinion of भट्टभास्कर. Of course, we can take it granted, he might have erred. But any hasty judgement will totally confuse our understanding. A thorough knowledge of the accents through out the Vedic Literature and also the वैदिकप्रक्रिया as laid down in पाणिनि is indispensable before taking such a decision.



प्रायेण वैदिकप्रक्रियायाः स्वरप्रक्रियायाश्च पारम्परिकशैल्या वेदाध्ययनप्रक्रियायां लुप्त(लोप्यमान)प्रायता दरीदृश्यते ।



वर्षवृद्धमित्यत्र कारकादुत्तरस्य कृदन्तस्य प्रकृतिस्वरत्वे प्राप्ते तदपवादः ’तृतीया कर्माणि’ \[ ६-२-४८\] कर्मवाचिनि क्तान्त उत्तरपदे तृतीयान्तं पूर्वपदं प्रकृतिस्वरं स्य़त् ।



Here the commentary seems to be incomplete, by itself. It is unclear as it is wanting some more supplement in continuation of the sentence in the extract. 

अत्रैव ऊहितं फिट्स्वरेणेति भवेदिति ।
