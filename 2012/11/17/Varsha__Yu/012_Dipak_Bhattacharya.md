Dear Dr. Narayanan,

Your conclusion that we must have a *cit* suffix in *varṣa* is to the point. But two things in your mail struck me

You have said \<Then how an अन्तोदात्तत्वम्?> Can we put such a question? The antodāttatva exists by its own right. On what ground can one question its legitimacy? As you yourself averred \<Vedic forms are always self justified as error free.> I add the adjective “authentic” before ‘Vedic forms’. Then instead of questioning the legitimacy of a Vedic form should we not seek what Pāṇinian suffix becomes appropriate for the form? Of course, such a query could be made if there was any observation or vidhi among the utterances of the three great sages that contradicted the antodāttatva of *varṣá*. But do we find any such saying in their works?

The attempts to include the word *varṣá* in a relevant gaṇa also is unnecessary. A gaṇavidhi is necessary when you cannot justify a form by a sāmānyavidhi. More often than not a gaṇavidhi lists a large scale apavāda. But do we know of any anomaly with an antodātta *varṣá*? Does Pāṇini give any rule that contradicts this antodāttatā? Then why worry?

Bhaṭṭabhāskara’s statement is strange. But great minds too err. We have to accept that.

Yours sinecerely

Dipak Bhattacharya
