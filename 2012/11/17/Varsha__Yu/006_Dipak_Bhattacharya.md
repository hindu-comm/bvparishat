Dear Colleagues,

*varṣa *is read in the *ardharcādigaṇa* mentioned in 2.4.31 *ardharcāḥ puṃsi ca*. That means that the error was that of Bhaṭṭabhāskara and not of the Gaṇapāṭhakāra.

However, it is not only the Gaṇapāṭha, but the existing Vyākaraṇa literature on the whole has got a lot of misreadings or errors requiring text-critical attention or rectification..

A clear case is the word *kal**āpī* found in the existing editions of the Siddhāntakaumudī with the Bālamanoramā commentary. On *j**āter astrīviṣayād ayopadhāt*( 4.1.63=SK 518) the editions with the Bālamanoramā read the word *kal**āpī* in the list *aupagav**ī*,*ka**ṭhī*,*kal**āpī*,*bahvṛc**ī* in the Vṛtti. In the commentary too the word *kal**āpī* has been explained**:** *kal**āpīti/ vaiśāmpayānantevāsitvanibandhano ṇiniḥ/ kaṭhacarakāl lug iti tasya luk.* But this is against Pāṇini who does not approve the form *kalāpī*. There is a paper by me on the error in the Bālamanoramā suggesting that it is not impossible that the error crept in from some mis-understanding of the manuscript.

There are also gross errors. On 7.1.39 *supāṃ suluk* etc. every commentator beginning from the Kāśikā to Jayakṛṣṇa through the Nyāsa, Haradatta and Bhaṭṭoji differs from the others in citing the sentence containing the employment of *tāt*. This too I pointed out in 2002.

It is necessary that teachers knew these un-Pāṇinian errors in the Pāṇinian sampradāya so that the wrong transmission is terminated.

Best
