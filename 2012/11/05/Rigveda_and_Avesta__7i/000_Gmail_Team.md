Critical Edition of Rigveda. Good idea? What is the use? To prove that some western scholars were wrong.It is a fact that they do not care about our writings.



The question is do we really like to admit what our writers are writing? It may be more useful here on bvparishat to discuss the content of the book "Rigveda and Avesta" by Shrikant Talgeri.

His main thesis is initially Anu, Druhyu and Puru were living in Punjab. Yadu and Turvasu were in South and East. Fine!



All these tribes were children from two queens of YayAti (son of Nahus'a son of Aayu son od PururavA son of Budha and IlA. Budha (also called Vrika)was son of Tara(wife of Brihaspati) and Candra)

Devayani was the daughter of Shukracarya--priest of Asuras-her children are Yadus and Turvasus. The second queen Sharmis'thA was daughter of Daitya king Vris'aparvA. Her children are Anu, Druhyu and Puru.So in the ancient Punjab Asuras and Daityas were living together. So our ancient history is that of Asuras and Daityas and their children.



Now please show me where the tribe of Tris'tu Bharatas fit into this geneology? Also when exactly Samvarana Kuru (ancestors of Kauravas and Pandavas)appears into this picture? Samvarana was referred to as Aarks'a (descendant of R'ks'a). However Anu king Shutarvan Aarks'a is referred in Avesta and some reference in Rgveda(VIII.74.4). It looks like Kurus appear as descendants of Anu kings (who were moved westwards in Late Rgvedic period). No wonder we find Vahlikas in Afghanistan. Please contradict me so I can gain in my knowledge.



Purpose of Rgveda-Our heritage-Good. Use mantras for Yajnyas to establish peace in the world.(It never happened). Use mantra and Yajnya for ndividual salvation. We are doing that for more than 3000 years.Who knows who got the salvation or not?



On the other hand I think research in Rgveda from historical point of view as Shri Talgeri did is more useful to understand India's ancient history. In this ancient history the history of the most important god(Bhagvan Krishna) of India is involved.In 2012 who was Arya and Who was Dravida makes no sense.



Sati wrote about Indus valley date moved back by another 3-4 thousand years. This is expected but it again refers to Baluchistan (region of ancient Anu kings). Can anybody tell me the ancient name in Baluchistan ? Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
