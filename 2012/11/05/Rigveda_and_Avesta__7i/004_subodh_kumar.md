Dear Sir,

I entirely agree with you that there is urgent need for presence at the internet of our views on Vedas as an addition to what has been made available through half baked untruths of Griffith and Fritz Stall etc.

I am not a scholar of sanskrit . But I have a passion for Vedas and Yajnas.

I have been trying to interpret Vedas more on apara topics , on earthly levels.

For instance I find that Yajurved Chapters 1 &2 that deal with Darsh Paournamaswshti Yajnas, are in fact showing the Vedic version of modern ISO9000 type system to monitor the gokrishi- गोकृषि the dominant life style of then prevailing society.

I also have interest in Indian cows. I look after a goshala in Delhi that has over 650 herd strength. Another subject of my study is guidance from Vedas on importance and managing cows.

From chapter 17 of Yajurved I get the impression that Maruts मरुत correspond to microbes and organisms of modern microbiology.

I have worked out lot of Vedic material on this subject.

RigVed 1.50 deals with photo biology and indicates importance of Vitamin D

Rigved 2.14 gives directives for CEO of a nation अध्वर्यु about guide lines and priorities including global warming and repair of hole in ozone layer.

Rig ved 4.58 talks about human body cardiac system .

Rig Ved !.191 deals with Solar pasteurisation. 

Like this I have been making effort to study veds. My interpretations obtain little comments perhaps because they are either flawed or else most readers interested in Vedas do not have scientific temper.

I have often sent my notes on Vedas on this BVP forum also. But I find no comments on any thing related to interpretation of Vedas. Perhaps Vedas are held too sacred to understand and comment and are fit to be only worshipped.
