 Talageri is not a Vedic scholar. To understand Vedic history, *Rig Veda and the History of India* by David Frawley is a better source.



 Also, a great deal of new data from natural history and genetics, as well as about the domestication of crops and livestock has come to light in the past decade. All these have a bearing on Vedic and Pre-Vedic history. We should not dismiss alternatives and possibilities without examining them.
