Sir,  
  
I have seen a vaishya coffee planter from Chickmagalur (Karnataka) performing sandhyavandanam while on his visit to Sringeri some fifteen years ago. Till some fifty years ago there were even VedapAThashalas for vaishyas in Tamil nadu. These days most vaishyas perform the upanayanam for the boy during his marriage ceremony itself.
