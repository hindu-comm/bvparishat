Namaste  
  
Since we are on the 'sandhyopasana' thread, I seek a clarification for a question raised by someone:  
  
It seems the 'gAyathri mantra' has a curse from Durvaasa and another muni. As a result, just before we start chanting the gAyathri mantra we have to utter some mantra that wards off the effect of the curse. It is only then the gayathri mantra becomes effective. What is that mantra?  
  
I have not heard of such a thing before nor is any such mantra mentioned in the sandhyavandanam books/sampradaya that I am familiar with.  
  
I request scholars here to please give their opinion / clarification if any on the above.  
  
warm regards
