One finds the mention of Brahmayajña or Svādhyāya as obligatory in the Gṛhyasūtras – see Bodhāyana Gr. 2.9.5, Bhāradv. Gr.3.15, Vaikh. Gr. 6.17 etc. The Sandhyopāsanā is mentioned in some Gṛhyasūtras like the Drāhyāyaṇa. But the elaborate sandhyopāsanā will not be found in detail. Only the very late Paddhati-granthas give details. They vary from region to region and from sect to sect.
