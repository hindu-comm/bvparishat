Namaste  
  
A few months back when I was looking for the source of this अहरहः सन्ध्यामुपासीत Vidwan Vyasanakere Prabhanjanacharya of Bangalore told me that Sri Madhvacharya has cited it in the anu bhAShya. He also said that the source is the Aitareya Aranyakam and that he would give me the exact reference but could not do so as he became preoccupied with some other publications. I too did not pursue it with him.
