Dear Subramanium,  
  
Yes it shows that It was common for all, but due to invaders attack the system and knowledge restricted to Brahamins. Yajnopavit is to start learning in Gurukul or School, and Sandhyopasna means to develop self confidence with pranayam and Mantra recitation.  
  
Now even the Brahamins are unaware about the importance of Yajnopavit and Pranayam. and Tricall Sandhya, they are confined to idol worship and Sandhya is ritual.  
  
With regards  
  
Dr.C.P.Trivedi
