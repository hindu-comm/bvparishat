Dear Shrikantji,  
  
The query about 'Sandhyopasna' is important, If you can give some information that how the Sandhyopasna restricted to Brahamins only?  
  
As per my knowledge the Daily Trikal Sandhya and Gayatri Mantra Japa is
identity of a Brahamin, now very few are following the Trikal Sandhya.  
  
Once every Indian whether Brahamin, Kshatriya, or Vaishya were entitled for Yajnopavit and Sandhya, it was restricted to Brahamins afterwards.
