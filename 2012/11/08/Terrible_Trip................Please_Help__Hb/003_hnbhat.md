That is right. The members hotmail account should have been hacked and somebody is sending with his ID the mails to all his contacts.

  

It happened to me also. But luckily I had not used hotmail ID for registering or [live.com](http://live.com) a/c. Both are Windowslive and hotmail are linked and if one is hacked, the other also could have been hacked. Only when somebody brings to his notice only, he will know it. Otherwise not.

  

This happened to me also to my hotmail account, and when I changed the password, my related Sky Drive A/c also was blocked. I could not pass their test for my claim again, and I lost all the data in my Sky Drive A/c.

  

Some spam folder should be arranged for the group itself. Earlier also some time ago, we used to receive from Ramakrishnacharyalu who is in Thirupathi itself, and himself appealed to the group not to respond to the mails.

  

Any idea is acceptable, a strong spam filter. Usually Google has a strong spam filter. But when it comes from the member of the group, it seems to be doubtful of its genuineness.

  

With regard
