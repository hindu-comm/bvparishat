Thanks for the info. I have located the link but downloading is not  
user friendly. But with some effort I will get it. I am having the  
original text as edited and published by Pt. Satvalekar. Since the  
text has some interesting astronomical information I like to study  
what the commentator, in this case Ramatirtha, had to say on Dhruva,  
Ayana, S'ani-raahu-ketu etc. Are there Bhashya by SaayaNa,  
Bhaskara,....?  
kind regards
