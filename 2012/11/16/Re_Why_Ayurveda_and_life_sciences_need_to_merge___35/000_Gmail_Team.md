Namaste  
  
Thanks for sharing the document. Here are my response points:  
  
" Life" is studied in different modalities of Sciences: One tradition focuses on Matter encompassing Life; Another tradition focussing on Matter-processes impacting Life. The perception of relation between what is ' matter' and what is 'relation of matter to life' Ayurveda belongs to the later category.   
  
Current day research advancements and trends in drug delivery technologies are touching the subtler levels of mater that most likely impacts the 'life processes about which there is more to be investigated and deliberated.  
  
The handshake to happen needs both ends of different hands to come closer and interact -interlock for strength. Traditional terminology from source works would use a nomenclature called 'Prana -Chikitsaa' - a tradition deep inside of Ayurveda called as training to be a Praanaacharya ).  
  
For understanding of which, the study of Samskrutham as the language of Life and longevity ( as pointed by Patanjali) needs to be restored. This is the direction in which Yoga-Samskrutham University is seeking research affiliations from the Ayur-Veda teams."
