Dear Ramanathji,  
  
You have raised intelligent point  
  
One should lift oneself by one's own efforts and should not degrade one;s own self,, the man is friend and foe of him self.  
  
The supreme lord is the cause of existence, he has nothing to do with your good or bad deeds. Our actions in life are immortal, whatever we are in the present birth is due to our past deeds, and whatever will be in next birth is due to our own action.  
  
All are talking in the same way at grass root level.  
  
With regards  
  
Dr.C.P.Trivedi
