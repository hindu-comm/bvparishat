Dear Trivedi Ji  
You said that  
"Dear Subramaniumji,

Kindly try to interpret Sankhya, Shankar, Geeta or any scripture in the  
light of modern discovery of Higgs God particle, it has been described as  
Hiranyagarbha, Purushe, Vishvakarma creator or Prajapati Lord of beings, or  
Brahma , and you will get all the answer that all our sages are saying one  
and same thing."

In this regard I want to know that how you will interpret the verse  
uddharet-atmana-atmanam(6.5 Gita)  
One should raised himself from the deep ocean of 'Samsara', one should  
not lower himself down, since one is his own's own relation and he  
himself is his enemy.  
The vere clearly indicates that the atman or brahman is not the cause  
of creation of either universe or a human being. However, it is a man  
himself cause and effect as if he performs good action then comes in  
good realm otherwise in bad realm. The karman is the cause of creation  
as Prof Subhramanyam rightly observed. The process of birth and death  
is continual process and this because of karman.

\> dead body and to fulfill the need of a ruler in his place, created पृथु. So

\> त्रिशंकु, when he was denied place in स्वर्ग created by ब्रह्मा. So afraid

\> his authority in tact as the Creator God. This was done in the Harappan  
\> age, which is much later than the Vedic Ice Age and was stored in tablet

\> Thanks for your critical analysis.  
\>  
\> Vedas have long tradition to interpret in its proper form. Mostly have  
\> followed the Sayan's commentary, and Puran Brahaman Upnishad and Aranyak.  
\> They could not go beyond the imagination of Manu and his wife first gene.  
\> It has been adopted in the Bible as Adam and Eve.Now at least after 18000  
\> years we have touched the height of Vedic civilization, hence we are in  
\> better position to interpret the Rig-Veda, from Rig-Veda the things have  
\> been modified as per the contemporary situation, and the requirement in  
\> Brahamaa literature, Upnishad, and Purana etc.  
\>  
\> Actually in the Vedic culture there was no fear of hell-heaven, God or  
\> Soul, they were living in harmony with nature. The formless creator is the  
\> supreme and source of all.Afterwards it has been interpreted as Brahma in  
\> Upnishad.  
\>  
\>  
\> The first chromosome is termed as Yama Yami, it has been evolved from  
\> Tvashta DNA, and with genetic recombination the whole biological world came

\> Dear Shri. Krishnamurthi,  
\> Thanks a lot. According to Vaiyaakaranaas Sphota is vyangya or what is  
\> suggested through conjuncts and disjuncts, hit the cochlea in the form of  
\> waves. Dhvani, as process for the suggested meaning, according to the  
\> followers of Anadavardhana is also vyanjana or the suggestion process, which  
\> ultimately results in the suggested meaning only. Abhinavagupta explains the  
\> grammarian view in his Locana: श्रूयमाणेष्विति। श्रोत्रशष्कुलीं सन्तानेनागता  
\> अन्त्याः शब्दाः श्रूयन्त इति प्रक्रियायां शब्दजाः शब्दाः श्रूयमाणा  
\> इत्युक्तम्। तेषां घण्टानुरणनरूपत्वं तावदस्ति; ते च ध्वनिशब्देनोक्ताः।  
\> यथाऽऽह  
\> भगवान्भर्तृहरिः---  
\> यः संयोगवियोगाभ्यां करणैरुपजन्यते।  
\> स स्फोटः शब्दजाश्शब्दा ध्वनयोऽन्यैरुदाहृताः।। (वाक्यपदीयम्-१.१०५)  
\> एवं घण्टादिनिर्ह्लादस्थानीयोऽनुरणनात्मोपलक्षितो व्यङ्ग्योऽप्यर्थो ध्वनिरिति  
\> व्यवहृतः। तथा श्रूयमाणा ये वर्णा नादशब्दवाच्या  
\> अन्त्यबुद्धिनिर्ग्राह्यस्फोटाभिव्यञ्जकास्ते ध्वनिशब्देनोक्ताः।  
\> Moreover Abhinavagupta says: अस्माभिरपि प्रसिद्धेभ्यः  
\> शब्दव्यापारेभ्योऽभिधातात्पर्यलक्षणारूपेभ्योऽतिरिक्तो व्यापारो  
\> ध्वनिरित्युक्तः। This is to establish vyanjana, the process for vyangya and  
\> it is dominently called the dhvani. Here he establishes that there is one  
\> more (the fourth process called vyanjana) apart from the well established  
\> three; i.e. abhidhaa, lakshanaa and the taatparyashakti. Precisely, a  
\> passive etymology of "dhvananam dhvanih" what the same process in the  
\> sphotah too which emerged out of sounds through conjuncts and disjuncts, hit  
\> the cochlea in the form of waves; and that is why it has been said as  
\> "hearing syllables". More Raamashaaraka comments in his Baalapriyaa:  
\> व्यक्तरूपग्रहणानुगुणा  
\> ह्यनुपाख्येयाकारा बहव उपायभूताः प्रत्यया ध्वनिभिः प्रकाश्यमाने शब्दे  
\> उत्पद्यमानाश्शब्दस्वरूपावग्रहे हेतवो भवन्ति।  
\> Moreover Abhinavagupta says: तेन वाच्योऽपि ध्वनिः वाचकोऽपि शब्दो ध्वनिः,  
\> द्वयोरपि व्यञ्जकत्वं ध्वनतीति कृत्वा। संमिश्प्यते विभावानुभावसंवलनयेति  
\> व्यङ्ग्योऽपि ध्वनिः, ध्वन्यत इति कृत्वा। शब्दनं शब्दः शब्दव्यापारः, न  
\> चासावभिधादिरूपः, अपि त्वात्मभूतः, सोऽपि ध्वननं ध्वनिः। काव्यमिति  
\> व्यपदेश्यश्च योऽर्थः सोऽपि ध्वनिः, उक्तप्रकारध्वनिचतुष्टयमयत्वात्।  
\> How Dhvani in four ways?  
\> 1. The expressive meaning, which can become a tool for suggestion  
\> (arthashaktimoolah);  
\> 2. The expressing sound, which can become a tool for suggestion  
\> (shabdashaktimoolah);  
\> 3. The suggestive meaning, which is being suggested  
\> (pradhaanavyangyaarthah);  
\> 4. The process for suggestion (vyanjanaavyaapara) having a shadow that of  
\> the process of Sphota, which is not appellation (literal process of  
\> meaning), but it is the process of meaning of allusion (suggession or  
\> figurative), also considered as the soul of poetry, or the real meaning of  
\> poetry.  
\> Panditaraja Jagannaatha does not contradicts these, but he renames the  
\> standard of poem-the dhvanikaavya as uttamottama (the best of best), uttama  
\> (best) stands for the subordinated suggestion, madhyama (expressive  
\> alnkaaras) and the sound dominanant adhama (inferior).  
\> Vyaktiviveka is a different approach with a view to rediculing ten  
\> disqualifications to the dhvani's title theory. The Buddhist  
\> paraarthaanumana theory reflected through Bhikshumokshakaragupta's  
\> Tarkabhaashaa etc. has been upheld by Mahimabhatta to present his Viveka, to  
\> highlight Kaavyanumiti which happens through any sort of relation.  
\> Triroopalingaakhyaanam Paraarthaanumaanam (the three forms are: anvaya,  
\> vyatireka and pakshadharmataa) is the criterion. Before Mahiman too,  
\> Bhattanaayaka also criticized the dhvani theory in his Sahrdayadarpana which  
\> is not currently available. Mahiman has a sincere approach in this regard.  
\> Ruyyaka having the mind of some constituted pretext is one of the blind  
\> followers of the dhvani theory criticises Mahiman and failed to comment  
\> gently in his partial commentary. There a few Hindi and Malayalam  
\> commentaries in that Ruyyaka way, may be in some other Indian dialects too.

\> Namaste,  
\>  
\> Veda gives hints in very Sookshma manner. Dharma-Shaastrakartaas experiment  
\>  
\> it on society & formulate into Dharma-Shaastraas. Anga Daana has been  
\> prohibited according to Vaidhika-Bhauta-Shaastra, Vaidhika-Nyaaya-Shaastra,  
\>  
\> Dharma-Shaastra. Organ donation is purely a cunning business hosted by  
\> foreign agencies with hidden agenda & most of the medical practitioners  
\> blindly follow the names of big bosses.  
\>  
\> There will be a day when Science itself will declare that organ & blood  
\> kind of donations are useless, we have found more advanced & safe technique  
\>  
\> to develop the spoiled organ tissues!! We have to wait with respect to  
\> Kaala + Dharma to come into action.  
\>  
\> Veda won't give us list of mistakes we do every day. In a single word it  
\> tells all the mistakes done knowingly, in a day. Nyaaya Sutrakaaraas  
\> expanded it and found the formula to calculate those mistakes in Society.  
\> At present Kaala it is said that the most of the human knowingly does  
\> 24,000 mistakes !! Khandana of Artha-Vaada is  
\> done in initial sutras of Meemaansa itself. Vedas are not in Sanskrit, its  
\> in Brahmi!!  
\>  
\> So I wish to move ahead with Rishis to understand 6 different encodings by  
\> 10 different ways of Veda-PaaTa vidhi. After this we will get access to 14  
\> different Vidhyaas of Veda, among which "Dharma" is one. So Dharmaadharma  
\> Vivechanaa is at very high level. If any one really wants the Shruti  
\> Aadhaara for the prohibition of organ donation you are welcome to get it by  
\>  
\> only face to face mode of discussion.  
\>  
\> One more point is that we never required selling & buying of organs as done  
\>  
\> now. We had several medical techniques to recover the spoiled tissues or  
\> organs. Original "Shalya-Tantra" is one among them which helps in treating  
\> any Jeevi by doing Bhedha of Bhaadhita Anga in the virtue of Shalya and  
\> create "Pratyanga" without any sensation of pain, without affects of  
\> Anesthesia!!
