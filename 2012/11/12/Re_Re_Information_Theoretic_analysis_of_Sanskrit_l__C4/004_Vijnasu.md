Dear Aniket,  
  
Its good to take epics to study information theory, but don't come to concluding the dates of those texts.  
  
Bhagawan Shri Ramachandra appeared in 24th Treta Yuga, which would mean approx 14 million years ago. Apparently mentioned in Vayu Purana and possibly Bhagawatam. Date of Vedas cannot be fixed as it was there from the time immortal.
