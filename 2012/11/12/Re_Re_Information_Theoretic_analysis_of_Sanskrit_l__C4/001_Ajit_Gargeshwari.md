As I'm commenting on the evolution of the language, I need to confirm, whether particular literature belong to a particular period. I understand that most of these works were composed over a span of time - from a few decades to even a few centuries.Below in the table are the eras when I considered these works were composed for my study. I request you to tell me if any of these works have faced a substantial change over the ages after their composition or do they still stay almost true to the original? If there have been any major changes I request you to provide me with a some further information about it so that I can adjust my study accordingly.  
  

Namaste,  
  
All dates on ancient texts such as vedas are relative I don't think any scholar can give an absolute date. He or she can only give you valid and good reasons why they assign a particular. You can read several of the books and articles published and arrive at you conclusion.  
  
Except for the Vedas, several of Kalidasas works puranas etc have come down in various version followed different Manuscript traditions. Critical edition on a few Puranas and Kalidasas's work have been published you can read them  
  
Are the works original or have interpretations crept a Critical edition of a given work would be the best guide.  
  
The dates you have assigned can be found in any standard history book but a Scholar might and another might not.  
  
The areas pertaining to your question wide vast and there have been several arguments and debates among scholars with no unanimity on dates and variation of texts.  
  
Collections of documents found in Sanskrit.org are not critical editions or don't have all the printed editions and Manuscripts. You have to get a hold of the original books either printed or in manuscripts or both on specific authors or vedic literature and then apply "Information Theory parameters " One cannot apply information theory and make any statistical analysis on a single text data base.  
  
As to Theoretical Analysis of evolution of Sanskrit Language there a wide range of books published which one choose and read.  
  
My answers are just pointers and I hope it has partially answered your question.
