Mr. Deshmukh



Good luck to you in your endeavour.



I gather that you do not want comments on the dates considered by you. Even so, you must know about the war between Pulakesin II and Harshavardhana and the edict that was issued after the war, where Kalidasa - along with Bharavi - is mentioned by name. So going upto A.D. 700 for Kalidasa is quite a stretch.



Regarding the other question: Except Ramayana and Padyavali (about which I do not know), the received wisdom is that the other texts have not changed. Why? In case of the Rigveda there are various techniques like anukramanis, embedding of string length within the metatext (learnt along with the text), vikriti paaThas like krama and ghana have all kept the text intact. A commentary is considered to be a kavacham which ensures the integrity of the original text. This was supplied in the 14th century through Sayana's Bhashya (though there were other earlier commentaries, we do not have them in full).



Kalidasa's works have the commentary of Mallinatha Suri and a number of others, ensuring their integrity. The various differences in readings are also well documented. Usually electronic corpora do not incorporate the paaThaantaras.



Jayadeva's work also has commentaries, besides being quite late (at best requiring two transcriptions to survive till modern times).



Ramayana due toits length, has been commentated upononly quite late - about 17th century. By that time, quite a few differences have emerged in the various paaThas. There are two very interesting linguisitic analyses of Ramayana, apart from the papers of Dr.Nil Madhav Sen - which to my knowledge are the first detailed analyses in English of the language of Ramayana. The first, a classical linguistic study is by Dr. Satyavrata Sastri, which was carried out even before the Baroda critical edition of Ramayana was published. The second, and far more interesting work is by Dr.L. A. VanDaalencalled Valmiki's Sanskrit. There he seemingly starts to do what Dr. Satya Vrat Sastri did, that is evaluate the language of Valimiki in light of Panini, but quickly takes a different turn. He starts looking closely at the sections considered to be interpolations (entire Uttara Kanda, huge swathes of Bala kanda, and many sargas in between according to some) and compares the results on un-Paninian usages there with other considered-to-be-genuine sections. It turns out that in the considered-to-be-interpolated sections there is a huge increase inun-Paninian usages. He investigates this further by comparing the story. For instance in the incident about Jatayu, there are two sargas which go through the same narrative material but in one, Jatayu reveals that it is Ravana who has taken Sita in the southern direction. Now, Dr. Van Daalen argues, if it is already known that it is Ravana who has taken Sita in a southern direction, the elabroate search party being constituted etc. does not hold the attention of the reader to justify such a lengthy explanation. So, he puts the sarga which reveals that it was Ravana who abducted Sita as an interpolation.Then he compares the use of language in that sarga with other considered-to-be-interpolations and his proposition holds.



Dr. Van Daalen going against the grain of received wisdom in historiography (which holds that the more corrupt the language, the older the language)claims that Valmiki's Sanskrit has very few un-Paninian usages, but it was the later interpolators with their weak language skills and regional variations - and bad narrative- who made interpolations and made Ramayana what it is today. I believe further analyses of Ramayana, especially to find out the effect of time on language, necessarily needs to beinformed by Dr.Van Daalen's work.

  
Finally,I would urge one thing, though unsolicited. There is a danger that in thesekind of daichronic analyses, the researcher sits in judgment - one who kind of decides Valmiki/ Kalidas / X knew Sansrkit well,or did not read Asthadhyayi on the conjugation of thedistant past tense or reduplication ofroots or. . . . That is getting the causationbackwards, just like Dr. VanDaalen showed in terms of Paninian usage andpossible-interpolations. Under the sutra, prishodaraadi etc.Patanjali explains clearly that SishTas are the pramaaNa for the form of a word that is saadhu and thatVyakarana only helps identify such SishTas.In other words, good Sanskrit is what is used by great people and what Maharshi Panini taught usis theessence of such good usage. Now, if occasionally there are deviations, the right attitude is neither to blame Panini (that he did not describe properly) nor the user (thathe did notknow Panini). What is the right attitude? Our ancestors call such usages aarshaprayogas - the usage of Rishis. They are what they are - language has a force of itsown and sometimes some formsmanifest themselves in thewords of great people, in theworks ofgreat poets (forinstance the word asaampratam in Kalidasa'sKumarasambhavam whenBrahma talks about his inability to kill Tarakasurawhom he himself strengthened: vishavriksho'pi samvardhya svayamacchettum*asaampratam*).



This does not mean that I suggest that there beno analysis. No. ThoseRishis themselves would be happy if their children show diligence. The presentation of the analysis ought to be informed of thedirectionality of cause and effect and at all times, respectfulfor those who have made the way for us to walk. Modern education, excellent in other spheres, seems to be sorely lacking in inculcating respect andgratitude for the Rishis - or, it might be that respect is reserved only for work in the more mundane sciences - like focussing on Newton's achievements rather than failure to anticipate Einstein, or indeed Einstein's theory of relativity rather than failure to give a complete Grand Unified Field theory.



Maybe an analogy from material science would clarify the view thatthe science of grammar as exounded by Panini is one of the most comprehensive ever - not merely in terms of any language, but compared to otherhard, modern sciences as well. For instance, the yield strength of steel is usually about a tenth of what it ought to be if we were to compute it as per the forces operating at the atomic level (which are the real reason for the strength of steel). This is usually attributed to impuritiesand granularity. However the exacteffect of specific impurities on reducing the strength is not quite known, though it would be hugely useful to do so (then Eiffel tower could have one-tenth the material used). We do know the yield strength of steel, but do not know why it is one-tenth of what it ought to be. Similarly flying in aerolplanes is so routine that one would be justified inexpecting that the 'science'underlying flying is fully understood. Not quite. We have very little understanding of theturbulent layer ofair flow near the skin of the aircraft. We simply know how to predict the behaviour as long as the aricraft doesn't approachthe speedof sound too closely (that is why commercial aircraft don'tusually go beyond0.9 mach - around the speed of sound, we know the behaviour of air flow changes).Our lack of fundamental understanding is hidden behind various numerical constants. Like with strength of steel, we can predict the effect but not explainit fullyin terms of fundamental science.Just likewe do not focuson our lack of complete understanding of material science (in solids likesteel, or gases like air), but rather celebrate the great advancements possible due to our understanding, with Panini,our ancestors celebrated what was understood ignoring the miniscule fraction of good words thatwere not 'understood'.
