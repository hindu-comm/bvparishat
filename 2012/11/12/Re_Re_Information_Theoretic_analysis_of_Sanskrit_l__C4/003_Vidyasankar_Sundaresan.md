It is very welcome news to me that such projects are being done in the  
IIT campuses. More power to you and your advisor. The more such  
projects are done in India, by Indian students, the better.  
  
A number of pertinent points have been made by others on this thread.  
Let me add the caveat that proof reading of the texts available on  
[sanskritdocuments.org](http://sanskritdocuments.org) has not always been done well. It is crowd  
sourced and therefore there is quite a lot of variability in the  
contents. A lot depends on the person who encoded the text originally.  
People have not always been able to go back and edit their  
contributions to fix mistakes, so please be careful when using them.  
(This is just a statement of fact, not a criticism of those who have  
contributed e-texts to the archive, for I happen to be one of those  
who has been lax about proof-reading the few documents that I have  
contributed to it.)  
  
Re: dates - gItagovinda should be at least about half a century  
earlier than the time period you have mentioned. A little bit of  
research will tell you that there are literary and inscriptional  
pieces of evidence about the gItagovinda right around 1200 AD. If the  
Padyavali you mention is by Rupa Goswamin, then you possibly again  
have to move the period earlier by about 40-50 years at both termini.  
However, please note that the Padyavali is an anthology of devotional  
verse put together by the Goswamin, so the dates of the actual verses  
in it probably span a good chunk of time, from the 11th-12th century  
to the 15th century.  
  
I notice that you have only picked poetic works and nothing in prose.  
I would hypothesize that prose will show other kinds of trends in the  
evolution of the language that verse does not reveal, because it does  
not have to conform to meter. There are many prose works available,  
starting from the brAhmaNa portions of the veda through the various  
philosophical texts, as also texts like daSakumAracarita, kAdambarI,  
vAsavadatta etc. Of course, I understand yours is a bachelor's degree  
project, not a PhD thesis, so you have to define the scope of your  
research more narrowly. This may be something to at least explore in a  
preliminary fashion for future extension of your work.  
  
With best wishes for your project,  
Vidyasankar
