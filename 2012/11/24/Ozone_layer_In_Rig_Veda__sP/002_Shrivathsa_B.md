hariH OM,  
shrii rao,  
  
"If it is to convey that ignorance is dispelled by some divine power (which is what Madhvācārya and Sri Aurobindo  
seem to think), why use such circuitous metaphors with obscure symbolism to convey it?"  
  
 Everywhere in veda, we find the principle of parokShapriyA devAH pratyakShadviShaH. Hence it is not surprising for kavis to use allegories, at times circuitous ones. I am not an advocate for shrii madhva or shri aurobindo (i haven't read shrii madhva's bhAShya. aurobindo's "bhAShya" didn't impress me much), but this is what comes to my mind.  
  
 Don't forget that you are "stretching" logic as much if not more than aurobindo or madhva in giving your interpretation of these verses.  
  
 By stretching your logic a little, one can say, some person somewhere recorded a glacial lake outburst flood and other people are continuing to carry that story. How many floods have occured during your lifetime, have you ever written a poem / poems on it? Furthermore, if you write such poems, do you think your sons and grandsons will carry that tale forward? I request you not to push this "anti-apauruSheya" argument too hard. It is not tenable given that it goes against our civilization's wisdom. We are not the first intelligent beings on earth.  
  
svasti,  
 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,  

shrivathsa.
