Dear Joshi ji,

I read your exposition of Aghamarshan Mantras RV10.190 and was very happy to learn this scholarly interpretation.

I hope you will kindly excuse me for sharing information about Ozone Layer and actions to protect against Global warming in Rig Ved 2.14.

I got curious about what Vedas say about the very early time before formation of Ozone layer. The temperatures on earth were so intense that no life was possible before the ozone layer was formed to provide a protective shield from toatal solar radiations by Ozone layer. 

I find that Rig Ved 1.32 describes this period .But I have not been able to make much progress in understanding this RV1.32 sookt completely. The little ffprt made sofar in draft stage (in Hindi) is also submitted for scholars to consider.

I wonder if you will have time to consider a study of this aspect in Vedas also.

With utmost regards,
