नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

It is unfortunate that we have to face a question such as - is  
Patanjali truthful ?

Somewhere in the middle of Mahabhasya Patanjali remarks - अस्मिन्  
कुले उपरतः स्वाध्यायः।

It is difficult to fix the exact times of sages and much more to fix  
the time taken for the gradual loss of so many branches of veda.

We cannot certify that all the branches were in currency during the  
time of Patanjali . What all he meant is one who ventures upon the  
task of compiling Vyakaranam should have the knowledge of such a vast  
literature , i.e. only a Yogi can dare and succeed .

Muktikopanisat (1-12-13) gives different number --

ऋग्वेदस्य तु शाखास्स्युः एकविंशतिसंख्यकाः ।  
नवाधिकशतं शाखा यजुषो मारुतात्मज॥  
सहस्रसंख्यया जाताश्शाखास्साम्नः परंतप।  
अथर्वणस्य शाखास्स्युः पञ्चाशत्भेदतो हरे ॥

By and large Patanjali,s version is taken as an authority .

धन्यो,स्मि
