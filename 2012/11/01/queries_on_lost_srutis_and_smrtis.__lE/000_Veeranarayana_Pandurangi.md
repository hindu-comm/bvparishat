Dear all  
Patanjali said there were 21 rgvedic sakhaas 100 yajurvedic 1000 samavedic and 9 atharvasakhas. How much time it might have taken to loose these shaakhas.  
What might be correct time of patanjali when he says these sakhas are present. based on this lossing period.  
And bigger question is whether he can be taken speaking truth on the number of shakhaas or not.  
One more thiing is i had heard from prof prabhakara shastriji that a list of nearly 500 lost smrtis in baroda library. Thiis list of works that were in the possession of kavindracharya a is ascribed to some student of that acharya in varanasi. During muslim attack somebody fled to gujarat with this library list to survive attack. List survived While the listed smrtis are lost in the process. Is it true?  
Can somebody send the pdf of list.
