There is a commendable commentary written in Malayalam language by Sri T. C. Parameswara Moossath ( It is an extensive commentary. The author quotes more than ten Sanskrit commentaries. Also quotes passages from classical Sanskrit literature as illustrative examples). The commentator, while explaining the quoted passage of Amarakosha, gives the meaning of 'arvaak' as 'prior in time or space'.
