Dear Colleagues,  
The sorry state of affairs at the BORI was noted with great disappointment. Since 2005, when I last visited the Institute, I tried several times to elicit a reply to my query on the availability of the without-critical-apparatus single-volume edition of the Mahabharata and the Vedic Bibliography Vol.6. I tried with both email and postal mail but to no avail. I collected a copy of the single volume Mahabharata from other sources but I still lack the Vedic Bibliography Vol.6for which a friend is personally trying.  
I also sent my words of sympathy to the Institute when the Institute was vandalized but that was not acknowledged.  
I have noted such state of affairs with some other great organisations too when they came into deep trouble. But have we not a right to know what actually ails the Institute?
