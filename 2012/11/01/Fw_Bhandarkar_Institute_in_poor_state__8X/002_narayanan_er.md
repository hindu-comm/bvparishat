Respected scholars,  
I have heard that the scholarly eminent and dedicated professors like Prof. R. G. Bhandarkar, Prof. S. R. Bhandarkar, Prof. Kathavate, Prof. Ghate, Prof. M.A. Mehendale, Prof. G.B. Palsule, Prof. S.D. Joshi and many more had collected more than 17,000 important manuscripts for the publication projects in that Institute. I feel that still that Institute could be saved if our Ministry of HRD is well informed in this regard. 17,000 important manuscripts mean, is clearly a representation of the whole Indian Heritage of Wisdom. As an instance, the pathetic condition of the Kerala Kala Mandalam, Cheruthuruthy, Kerala started changing after the Ministry of HRD took it up as Deemed University. Here in the BORI case if the Central Government does something, there comes the scope for the young Sanskrit students who do their M.A. and NET finding the way of learning and employment, as at present the Sanskrit learning has increasingly been dominated with the purpose of creating school teachers and the assistant professors in universities for the purpose of very limited teaching only. The academic works on the arts of calligraphy, manuscriptology, proof reading, editing and publishing have not been given serious attention where the valuable power of humanity is inevitable. The Ministry of HRD has got its tools like the Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan, the National Manuscript Mission, the National Archives etc. to take it up. If it happens so, it can regain its early/mid 20th century eminence and dedication to the Sanskrit activities. I thank my friend Mr. Deb Kamal Ganguly for sending a mail regarding his experience there and I join with one of our most respected scholars Professor Dipak Bhattacharya to express the sorrow on the pathetic condition of a well established Institute.  
Regards,  
Narayanan
