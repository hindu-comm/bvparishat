There seemed to be very little understanding or appreciation of any deeper view on the Vedas, such as Aurobindo had proposed.  
  

Dear Sir,  
  
You are talking only BORI but other centers are also the same attitude either it is Indology or Sanskrit Vamadeva (David Frawley)  

has observed the ignorance of deeper views on Vedas, although the Veda Vidhya Pratishthan, Sanskrit or Vedic University are for innovative critical research on Vedas, Give and take to promote their own ideas is the best policy.  
  
With regards  
Dr.C.P.Trivedi
