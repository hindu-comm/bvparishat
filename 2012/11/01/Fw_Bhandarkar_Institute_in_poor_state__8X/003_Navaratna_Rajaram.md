 The problem is more than organizational. BORI must define itself with a new vision relevant to our times, especially the youth.



 Western Indologists will of course not admit it -- it relates to their work, careerand their livelihood -- but the field is dead. They were once seen as interpreters of India to the West, but who goes to them today when they can get the same or better information from a neighbor, an office colleague or relative by marriage?



 The only way to revitalize the field is to redefine it-- awya from 19th century themes and create and use modern approaches. Outside organizations like Samskrita Bharati are doing more valuable work than academic departments which are now all but moribund. They are getting few students.



 BORI should consider appointing a committee of experts to see why it is in such sorry state. What is the age profile of people approaching it. What is the public expectation of institutions like BORI.



 If BORI wants to remain just another Indological center like those in the West, then it should expect to share their fate. It doesn't matter what anyone says, they are on the verge of extinction.



 One approach is to consider turning it into a museum cum library that supports a small staff and a few visiting scholars for limited period.



 Something has to be done. It cannot be business as usual. My colleagues and I have given a great deal of thought to the problem and the problem is not limited to BORI.



 I have attached two articles that may be helpful. (Polemics and personal attacks don't advance the field and are rarely helpful).



Sincere regards,

N.S. Rajaram
