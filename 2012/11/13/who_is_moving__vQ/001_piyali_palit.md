Dear Veeranarayana,

  

Shubha Deepaavalii.

  

Your question reveals other dimensions as well, that is, whether both we and time are moving simultaneously, OR, nothing moves at all, it's all our erroneous perception, etc.

  

While we are getting old, Time refreshes itself for the next generation - is that an instance of reverse movement theory ? Dynamics are really amusing !

  

Regards.
