It reminds me the vision of the Divine Life (the life of Sat-chit-ananda) on Earth (for which the Earth is DESTINED and for which the forces of Evolution and Involution are advancing towards each other with the TIME) of the great seer and mystic Sri Aurobindo, whose vision was based on the Vedic mysticism!
