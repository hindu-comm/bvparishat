Respected Scholars and members of भारतीयविद्वत्परिषत्,  
  
I am a final year undergraduate student from the Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Hyderabad, INDIA. I'm currently working on project- "Information Theoretic Analysis of evolution of Sanskrit Language". I have a doubt pertaining to my project regarding literary works in Sanskrit. I humbly request you to clear the doubt, which I have described in the upcoming paragraphs.  
  
In my project,I evaluated various Information Theory parameters and tested them on Sanskrit text files of different sizes. I collected a text database of Sanskrit literature - from Rig Veda to Gita Govinda and Padyavali and based on results from the Information Theory parameters, studied the evolution of Sanskrit language.The database(text files - (Unicode) I have collected is from [sanskritdocuments.org](http://sanskritdocuments.org).  
  
As I'm commenting on the evolution of the language, I need to confirm, whether particular literature belong to a particular period. I understand that most of these works were composed over a span of time - from a few decades to even a few centuries.Below in the table are the eras when I considered these works were composed for my study. I request you to tell me if any of these works have faced a substantial change over the ages after their composition or do they still stay almost true to the original? If there have been any major changes I request you to provide me with a some further information about it so that I can adjust my study accordingly.  
  
  
    Literature   Time  
1.       Rig Veda    2000 BC-500 BC  
2.       Ramayana    200 BC – 200 AD  
3.       Mahabharata   200 BC – 200 AD  
4.       Raghuvamsham  300 AD – 700 AD  
5.       Meghadutam   300 AD – 700 AD  
6.       Kumarasambhavam 300 AD – 700 AD  
7.       Gita Govinda  1200 AD – 1300 AD  
8.       Padyavali    1500 AD – 1600 AD  
  
  
Thank you for taking your valuable time for helping me out.  
  
Hope to hear from you soon.  
  
Yours sincerely,
