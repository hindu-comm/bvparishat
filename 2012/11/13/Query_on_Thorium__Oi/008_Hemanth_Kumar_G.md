With all respect I thought there are "scholars" who may give some inputs and queried to the group!! If somebody insists not to ask questions, they have several options like to keep quite & observe or put restrictions in the group that the questions to which I don't know answers are not allowed to be asked in groups!! or quit from group or insist to close the group itself!!  
  
Cultivate the habit of Chintana-Manthana first!
