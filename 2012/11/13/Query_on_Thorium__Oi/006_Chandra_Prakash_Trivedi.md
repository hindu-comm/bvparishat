Respected Nityanandji,  
  
You have raised a point worth to know the reason behind calling  
देवजल=divine fluid? Or is there some other etymology? How  
\> would one explain देवजल using निरुक्त or व्याकरण?  
  
Symbolism should have consensus for accurate interpretation, otherwise  
people will interpret in their own way, and the matter will be  
disputed.  
  
With regards  
  
Dr.C.P.Trivedi
