Namaste,  
  
Vedas are not in Sanskrit. It is in Brahmi Bhaasha known to only to  
few people in Rushi Paramparaa. In Pauranika Kalpana, Brahma is  
creator. In Vedanta, its Brahman, which is the ultimate god. But with  
respect to the Brahma-Rahasya what is told really with respect to  
Bhauta Shaastra or Brahma-Sutra by Baadaraayana is Praakrutika Rahasya  
only. Due to enormous meanings a word may possess, the different  
Shabda-koshas was formulated. One among them is Amarakosha. The  
intention of Amarasimha was to show that Saayana Bhaashya is not the  
ultimate one!! Kesha is also a Sankhya in Saankhya-Shaastra, it takes  
the near meaning of Bhruna in Bharadwaja's Prasutika Vijnana, hair in  
Deha-Shaastra, one of the minute measures in Anu-Vidhyaa, "It also  
asks the question- "which is the source?", the one which/who possess  
kesha is keshin and several other meanings according to different  
Shaastra under consideration.  
  
My Guru says that for the present world only 10 people are enough who  
know Bhauta Shaastra well. We don't wan't any recognition from any of  
the foreign agencies or so called intellectuals!! The real knowledge  
is here & its interpretation is 100% accurate. The questions for which  
science, vedantins, or any of the present scholars are unable to  
answer, is answered in Bhauta Shaastra. I am just translating some of  
them only for really interested (Shraadhaavaan) Bhaarateeya knowledge  
seekers (Jignaasus). No arguments, recognition, awards, publications,  
patents, doctorate or Nobel award is eligible to measure the Vaidhika  
Bhauta Shaastra.  
  
We Bhaaratiyaas should regain our individuality (Swabhimaan) that we  
have lost due to British rule. We have to develop Science & Technology  
for the wellness of our Society & the Country, not to get appraisal  
from foreigners.
