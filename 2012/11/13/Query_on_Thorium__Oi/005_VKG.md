Dear Hemant Joshi

It is interesting to note that your Guru has given to equivalent of **Deva - Jala to** thorium. With genuinecuriosity(Not in any negative intention of poking), I request the following information.

1.  What is the name of your Guru? 2.  What is the basis of his Narration of providing equivalence? 3.  If based on a scripture, what is the name and who is the author? 4.  What else is written there about usages and location of reserves? 5.  Finally, any Atomic Values, connected with Nuclear Energy are given
    anywhere. (Just recall, Dr. Abdul Kalam was referring to thorium,
    found in abundance in our nation - as a possible source in the place
    of expensive and restricted Uranium imported from abroad.)

Hopefully, this information would enthuse metallurgists and provide fresh impetus in our energy quest.

Thanks in advance.

Regards

VKG
