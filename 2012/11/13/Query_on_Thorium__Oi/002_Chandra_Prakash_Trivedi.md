Dear Hemantji,  
  
Brahma Vidhya is for spiritual knowledge, there is a strong need to prepare scientific terminology of Vedic terms with consensus of Scientists and Vedic scholars.  
  
**You are working but may be in wrong direction in absence of Vedic terminology**, **Brahma is term for formless creator, Vishnu is term for light, Keshin is term for ray, Akshar is term for Sound or Vac-words in my opinion it may look strange to you but go deep into the Vedas first to prepare and trace Vedic terminology with sound proof in terms of science** than it will be a accepted terminology, and than you can interpret the unpublished palm leaves, and put them before intellectuals first. Otherwise it will go waste and foreigners will laugh on us how we are making joke of our Sanskrit and Vedas. **Shri Ajit has pointed out the same.  
**  
  
With regards  
  
Dr.C.P.Trivedi  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

As in the title, **Brahma-Vidhya** = *Brahma* = Nature and its numerous topics. **Brahma-Rahasya** = Secret of Nature. Root element for the Creation, its hot and cold interactions. The Root Element called as the *Anu* (अणु) = **Atom = ** **Moola-Chaithanya** has the property of continually losing its temperature. For self-survival and existence, it transformed into living species, plants, trees, materials etc. How life created? How the nature is withholding this temperature? For that process, how much effective are **Light** (*Kirana*) **+** **Sound** (*Shabda*) named two **waves** (*Taranga*)? How much is the truth? Even though, how these core elements are trying to guard their stealth? all these are revealed in this Epic. It explains the sound and light in terms of **Yoga + Maaya.**
