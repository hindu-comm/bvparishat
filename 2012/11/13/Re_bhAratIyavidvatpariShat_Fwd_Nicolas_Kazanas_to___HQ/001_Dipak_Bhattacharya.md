\<I have searched its background in Vedic Science and find that it is not a script at all.>  

I already told that Dr.Trivedi’s conclusions are identical with those of Dr.Witzel and Dr.Steeve Farmer. He might find admirers in them. However, one uncomfortable outcome may be that Dr.Trivedi’s claim to be the first discoverer will not be accepted by the duo. Still it proves that great minds think alike.
