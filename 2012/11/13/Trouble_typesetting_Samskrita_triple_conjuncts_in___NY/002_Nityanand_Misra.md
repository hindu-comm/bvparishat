Update on this - I tried by installing TexLive 2012 today on my Windows machine and the TexLive version of XeLaTeX successfully printed the conjuncts. Attached is the output with Sanskrit 2003 font. Anybody else facing this problem on Windows please upgrade to TeXLive 2012.  
  
Thanks again to all those who responded.
