Dear Sh. Nityanand,  
Let me share with you a very little experience I have in this field. I regularly use Fedora 14 in lab and using Ubuntu 10.04 LTS - the Lucid Lynx - released in April 2010 and supported until April 2013 at my home, although both PC systems are loaded with the Windows XP too. Why I use Linux? It is Devanagari friendly, or more precisely, an Indian script friendly. According my very little experience, the incompetance of the Windows persists till its version of W7, as today I tried W7 at one of my friend's house in which the Malayalam characters ന്‍ ര്‍ ള്‍ ണ്‍ and ല്‍ are not renderable even with the help of the recommended keys. The problem, Sh. Nityanand, you are facing with the Devanagari is when the trio of conjunct consonants are to be rendered. This problem is well solved in Ubuntu 10.04 LTS if it is rendered in the Lohit Devanagari, but problematic unrendered in Fedora 14, but those (त्र्य, र्त्स्न्य, र्ष्ट्य, र्त्थ्य, र्ध्न्य and many) were rendering correctly in Fedora 11, where Lohit Devanagari was not a must to support. But Ubuntu 10.04 LTS depends Lohit Devanagari for the correct rendering the duos (both र preposing र्प and र pastposing प्र), trios, quadros and pentos of conjunct consonants. At the same time, there is no uniqueness of behaviour among Lohit Fonts of Gujarati, Bengali, Tamil, Devanagari, Punjabi (gurmukhi) regarding Linux character philosophy. But there are remedies for circumstancial dieseases.  
  
1. Once you create or convert data/corpus into Unicode Devanagari, paste or open in gedit Text Editor in Ubuntu 10.04 LTS or in the latest version.  
2. Check the conjuncts of र in duos to pentos, formatting to be done on Word Processor in Lohit Devanagari.  
3. Until and unless you finalize your editing don't convert the corpus into any other versions, viz. Fedora 11, or Fedora 14 or any other versions of Windows (95, XP to 7).  
4. Once you are happy with the editing, then finalize it by converting into pdf. without changing the version/system and once the pdf. is made then no bar of either Windows or Linux, irrespective versions of old and latest.  
Finally, I am not a software engineer and what I had been contemplating is a humble attempt on learing a bit of Sanskrit rhetorics and aesthetics. I appologize in advance if my observation is invalid or humbug. I request the software engineer members of this forum to correct me whereever I committed mistakes, which will help us to improve upon the quality of the application of the Devanagari.   
Regards,  
Narayanan
