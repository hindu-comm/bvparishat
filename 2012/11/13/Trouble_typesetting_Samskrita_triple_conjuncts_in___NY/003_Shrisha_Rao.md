\> Update on this - I tried by installing TexLive 2012 today on my Windows machine and the TexLive version of XeLaTeX successfully printed the conjuncts. Attached is the output with Sanskrit 2003 font. Anybody else facing this problem on Windows please upgrade to TeXLive 2012.  
  

It is well known that the TeX Live available on Linux distros (particularly on Debian/Ubuntu) are typically out of date by years, and difficult to use. If one has a high speed connection it is quite a simple matter to install the full TeX Live over the Net. Literally a couple of minutes of work, and does not even require admin access (though of course you need write access to the directories used). The only thing to be done is download a small file (see <http://tug.org/texlive/acquire-netinstall.html>), unpack and execute it, and choose a few settings (defaults should be okay) at the start. If your connection is fast, the rest of the install should take maybe an hour or so with no further work needed. For Mac users, the MacTeX installer (\~2GB download) does beautifully.  
  
As a point of information, this sort of issue is better discussed on the XeTeX list, which is fairly active. Browsing the archives of the list, or following discussions there without subscribing, are also possible. See <http://tug.org/mailman/listinfo/xetex> for more information.
