Namaskar

 The Centre for Indic-Asian Studies in the Rural Women’s University I am associated with is holding an International Conference on South-East-East Asia and India: Historical Interconnections in Art, Architecture and Culture of Laos, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam, 18-20 January 2013. The Conference focuses on the shared Indic-Asian culture of South East Asia



 This is the second International Conference. The first was on India-Korea Relations: Past and Present held in July 2012 whose Proceedings are under publication. These Conferences are being organized by the UGC sponsored Area Study Centre for Indic-Asian Studies set up to to undertake teaching and research in India’s classical and contemporary interface with Asia as a unit in the interwoven spheres of geopolitics, history, trade, religion, culture, language, science & technology.

 The Conference Brochure giving all details of the proposed Conference is attached.  
 I am requesting interested scholars to participate. This is in fact a Conference about Indic knowledge.

With regards,
