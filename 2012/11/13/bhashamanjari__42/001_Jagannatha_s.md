Dear Mahesh Kakathkar,

  

Some works of this type are available in various mss. libraries of our country. Interestingly, Manjari is the last word in the titles of all of these works (Girvanabhashamanjari, Bhashakusumamanjari etc). It seems that even Varadaraja, author of Laghusiddhantakaumudi has written a work like this. They give lists of the words regardingfloraandfauna, foods, spices, ornaments, festivals etc.. Some give lists of even some Shastric works.These Manjari works are of great interest.They require much research.A Manjari work is already published at a volume of Research Journal of Baroda Oriental Research Institute some 60 years ago.(I can not remember the name ).

Usually, these works are of conversation between two scholars of different regions. A scholarasks another one that what kind of the grains,foods, oils are available in his region.In continuation he asks what kind of trees one may see in his country.After completion of the answer, the scholar who was asked puts almost the same questions to the former one.And he, the former, starts to answer.

  

It is obvious that writing Samskrta books of simple conversational sentences with vocabulary of various walks of life for the use of beginners was pondered by Samskrta scholars in 17th century itself.

  

The Bhashamanjari, from which you have supplied a page is of the samecategory.

Yes, there may be some slight differences in treatment of the subject. As you say, it is possible that it is in the form of memory of Purvashrma of a Samnyasin.

  

Thank you for sharing a folio of the work.

  

Please edit it and get it published.

  

S.Jagannatha.
