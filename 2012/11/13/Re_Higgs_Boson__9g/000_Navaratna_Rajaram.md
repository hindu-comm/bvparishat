The recent announcement suggesting the discovery of the long awaited Higgs Boson, if confirmed, fills a gap in the theoretical description of elementary particles known as the Standard Model. It would still leave [More...](http://folks.co.in/blog/2012/07/26/boson-or-bust-higgs-and-his-godless-particle/)
