Dear Sir,  
  
I have send the book for your blessings and comment, as you are a scientist, historian archaeologist, philosopher and great scholar you can judge it in right perspective. I am not wrong in my assumption, kindly write few words on the book. My finding is that the symbols do not represent script at all, these are genetic symbols, which explore Indus Vedic Civilization. The Saraswati is not a terrestrial river as considered.  
  
With regards  
  
Dr.C.P.Trivedi
