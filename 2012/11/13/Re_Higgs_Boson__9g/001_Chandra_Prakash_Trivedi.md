Dear Shri Rajaramji,  
  
Thanks for the suggestion but I feel sorry that before 4th july I have claimed it as Vedic discovery, and it is the foundation of Vedas, as also I have given experimental proof of the discovery of DNA and atom 18000 years ago. The Vedic Science can give clues to understand the universe ahead.  
  
**The Higgs field by which the elementary particles acquire mass is intermingled with eternal cosmic energy. It has generated actions and interactions with positive proton and negative electrons with oxidation and reduction reaction, with synthesis and degradation as two great mothers for the creation. Accordingly the creation is working as a system. Where the electromagnetic bond energy, the sun is the source of subatomic particles and the living-beings them selves modify the physical environment with organic matter and complexity. **Indra produced one shape, Surya another: by their own power they formed the third from Vena Rig. 4-58-4  
  
  
It can give more answers ahead.  
  
  
With regards  
  
  
Dr.C.P.Trivedi
