The word छद्म is synonyous with कपट or छल; thus, it is possible to say that छल is the means of control of सर्वभूतानि by ईश्वर, according to Śankara.

\> The word छद्मना can be taken to mean 'hidden' or 'in disguise' also. Monier Williams gives the meaning छद्मरूपेण as "in disguise". There is also the meaning 'external covering' for the word छद्मन्. 'Incognito' is another meaning in the Apte Sanskrit-English Dictionary. It also cites the Raghuvamsham: ’पलितछद्मना जरा’ (Old age comes in the guise of grey hair..)  
  
I don't see how that is quite pertinent; these are meanings for छद्म, not for माया. It is well known that छद्म connotes various forms of deceit, including by dress and behavior, but this is not apropos in respect of ईश्वर, who does not control creatures while "dwelling in their hearts" by dressing deceptively.  
  
\> A man inside a cover/enclosure (unseen by others) causes a puppet made of wood (in the shape of a man etc) and mounted on something rotate or act variously. Children go on to think that the puppet is acting by itself. Ishwara, who resides in the hearts of all creatures revolves them, making them function according to their vasanas. People forget this out of their ego. The puppeteer is inside, and not visible. He is the power behind the action of the puppet. Similarly, it is Ishwara who as the inner controller, sits inside the hearts of beings and is invisible, controls them.

Interesting speculation, but hardly convincing -- a textual basis for correlating माया and छद्म is still wanting.  
  
Even otherwise, a puppeteer is characterized by complete control over his puppets (with his strings/wires) and the skill and dexterity with which he exercises said control to get the puppets to do as he wishes; he is not characterized by deception. There is no rule or principle of puppetry that he has to be concealed, either; most often puppeteers work in plain sight. Most people (children included) do not feel deceived by puppetry, and even if they might, deception is hardly the basis of a puppeteer's ability -- it is at most incidental. Here मायया is clearly used to denote the basis of the ईश्वर's control.  
  
\> The puppeteer example is given by other commentators too like Madhusudana Saraswati. The word in the Gita verse that necessitates this is 'यन्त्रारूढानि’. 'मायया’ is applicable both to the analogy and the antaryAmin.  
  
There is nothing surprising there; the puppet analogy is there in the BG verse itself so all commentators have to go with it. The issue is not the propriety of characterizing the अन्तर्यामी as a puppeteer, but the basis for reading माया as छद्म in the verse. There are authorities for other things; e.g., Śankara cites the RV to read अर्जुन as referring to ईश्वर, rather than being a mere सम्बोधन as one would normally suppose, and others cite एको देवः सर्वभूतेषु गूढः, etc., but there is none for reading माया as छद्म, nor a clear explanation of the propriety of doing so.
