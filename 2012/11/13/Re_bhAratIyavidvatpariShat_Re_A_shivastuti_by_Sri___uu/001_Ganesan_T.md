Whether माया can also be interpreted as छद्म or not, माया *can not mean* illusory power or illusion from this Bhagavadgita verse under discussion; For, ईश्वर controls and and makes the selves act through His power, (मायया) which cannot be illusory. For, a Real ईश्वर cannot have an unreal power. This is the assertion of the Saivasiddhanta system.  
  
This view of the Gita is the restatement of the famous Upanishadic passage:  
मायां तु प्रकृतिं विद्यात् मायिनं तु महेश्वरम् ।  
cited by all and even by Samkara many times.
