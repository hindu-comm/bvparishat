Why don't first refer to अमरकोश before referring to any other lexicons on any question which gives synonyms:

  

(१.७.४६८) कपटोऽस्त्री व्याजदम्भोपधयश्छद्मकैतवे\|\|  

  

which clearly makes छद्म synonymous with कपट which is against the statement in the long discussion,

  

``` Here also, there is no kApaTyam but only not revealing the true identity. ```

``` ```

``` As far as I know, कापट्य is the only the action of being कपट, concealing anything. Whether it is for good or bad, is decided by the context and not by the words themselves. ```

``` According to Amara again, the word माया has specific function to create illusion by magic 
```

``` ```

    (२.८.१४१८)  स्यान्माया शाम्बरी मायाकारस्तु प्रतिहारकः|

Simply quoting from different sources from different contexts doesn't settle the matter of being synonym or not as no two words are exactly synonym with the other in any given language, specifically such a rich language like Sanskrit. At the best, grammarians remarked ---

  

"सर्वे सर्वार्थवाचकाः"

  

which is limited to yogi-pratyaksha jnana, which is beyond the scope of our verbal knowledge. There is no point in rambling with the words, than making the readers weary with such arguments on any given topic as already pointed out by some member recently, which does not serve the purpose.

  

In this case, simply the topic is शिवस्तुति and the discussion dwindled away from the point around some words and their interpretation. There are such authentic assumptions --

  

धातूनामनेकार्थत्वात्, अव्ययानामनेकार्थत्वात् etc.

  

I don't see any need continuing with such arguments unrelated or not contributing to the topic directly. There are many ways to twist the popular meaning recorded by the earliest lexicographers like Yaska etc. in the case of Vedic Literature and in classical literature Amara and others. English translations are also context dependent and do not reveal exactly parallel meaning of the word as they quote from the context.

  

Please keep the decorum of the forum. This is my humble request.
