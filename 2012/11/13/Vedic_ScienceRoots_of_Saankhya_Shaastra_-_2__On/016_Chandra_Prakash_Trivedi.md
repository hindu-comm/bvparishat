They say Hirnyagarbha is Hig Boson and Vedic hyms speak about DNA  
  
  

Dear Ajiji,  
  
Thanks for your fantastic human vision. You have mentioned that you are a traditional physicist, and talking on DNA.  
  
With regards, actually you are modern intellectual I appreciate your straight thinking. Otherwise it is matter of pride and honor for India, but false theory of Aryan invasion has poisoned our thinking.  
  
You are free.  
  
With regards
