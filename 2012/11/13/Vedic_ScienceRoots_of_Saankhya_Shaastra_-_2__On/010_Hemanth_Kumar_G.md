Namaste,  

  
 Everybody is independent to propose their views.. If somebody doesn't accept its ok, its their view. So many historical evidences are purely manipulated ones by foreign invaders, this is already proved by many of the pure Indian Historians. But also same thing is taught for students in schools. False cannot become true if it is believed by any number of people. ***  
  
Unfortunately the Indian History was written by the British colonialists and they wanted to show that British Empire was the best thing for India and after independence Leftist took over.***  
  
18000 Darshana Shaastras are there, among which Shad-Darshanas (6) are publicly available now. That doesn't mean 17994 other darshanas won't exist? Among 6 one is Saankhya, which is the heavily filtered version of so many translations for many years. It's not the original sutra, just one of the translations of translations of....\|  
  
Many of the great Saints with lots of struggle protected our great epics before any of the invaders attacked Bhaarata. Attackers searched for texts like anything, robbed some of them, burnt a few. But the Vidhyaas was made Shrauta & coming in downstream till now in Guru-Shishya Paramparaa only. Also there are Gurukulas of great sages like Vyaasa, Agasta, Vasista, Vishwamitra, Gautama, Brughu, Devaraata, Dheerghatama, Upamanyu, etc., If one doesn't believe, they won't be considered as extinct.  
  
We have strong evidences on what's original & what's duplicate. Finally, scholars are invited for Vaada with all respect if they wan't to prove what we have written is wrong!
