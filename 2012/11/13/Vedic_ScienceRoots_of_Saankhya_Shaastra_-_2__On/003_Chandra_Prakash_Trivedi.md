Respected Rajaramji,  
  
He has interpreted in terms of mathematics why I could not understand? hence I have suggested to discuss with eminent scientists to him.  
In my view physics is physics there is no place for metaphysics if we discuss quantum physics.  
  
You are working on Vedanta and quantum physics and not used metaphysics, thanks it is correct approach.  
  
Your focus is on metaphysics, especially the structure of reality as revealed by the two**.It will be same in the end**  
  
I may send the book "Quest of creation Higgs God particle and Vedas" if you like .  
  
  
With regards  
  
Dr.C.P.Trivedi
