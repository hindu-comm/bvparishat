Dear Vidhyashankarji,  
  
Thanks for your curiosity, If you will go through the book? you will get the answer. Every thing is based on scientific theory in the Rig-Veda the first verse

**I invoke the Agni- (fundamental energy) who is the priest, Deva (fundamental particles), sacrificer, and reciter of the Srishti, Yaj¤a, which is the treasure of jewels Rig.1-1-1**

****It has been expressed that the eternal fundamental energy is working everywhere, he is the source of the creation, everything, which is present in the creation is due to the eternal fundamental energy.  

**Once only once, the heaven was made, once only once, the earth was formed. Once only, Prishni’s milk was shed; no second, after this, is born Rig-Veda 6-48-22**

It has been expressed that the earth and the atmosphere have been created once only, the Prishni is name of cow, who give all type of food. It is metaphor for food with photosynthesis and generation of chemical energy in plants, which feed the creation. Once the process of the creation has been started, it has maintained its continuity with evolution.

Fundamental energy the supreme creator, he is the source of all. It has synthesized the cell and DNA  

The life has evolved from single cell and DNA with photosynthesis.

  
  
**The Vedas are the first word of the civilized person, and the heritage of mankind on the earth. Actually in the Vedic culture there was no fear of hell-heaven, God or Soul, they were living in harmony with nature. The formless creator is the supreme and source of all. Afterwards it has been interpreted as Brahma in Upnishad.  
It is misleading to say that the knowledge incorporated in the Vedas have revealed in trance during meditation. It has turned Vedas towards superstitions. **  
  
**I feel some not all of your curiosity may have been solved.  
  
With regards  
  
Dr.C.P.Trivedi**
