Dear Hemant kumarji,  
  
There is enough matter for discussion only mathematics and quantum physics can not give all answers, it require interdisciplinary approach for consensus on all aspects.  
The Rig-Veda is the oldest from here the waves of knowledge flowed in different streams, Sankya came very late, your efforts are good try to discuss the results with eminent scientists. You have to explain **three Guna and eternal dynamism with evidences from Vedas?**  
  
**Let us try to find proper explanations from the vedas and derive results.  
**

**\[Krishnakumar M B\]Sankhya (33000 years ago)Sankhya forms the last word in Physics and places Vedic Science on thepinnacle of universal knowledge.forever.****  
The three Gunas represent the eternal dynamism ...... (that Physics has yet to derive)**  
  
With regards  
  
De.C.P.Trivedi
