 Quantum physics has raised fundamental metaphysical questions relating to duality, causality and reality. Founders of quantum physics like Schrodinger, Heisenberg, Bohm and others have looked to Vedanta for anwers. Bell's Theorem and other results have made the problem deeper.

See below formy MIT talk on the topic on youtube. I have given talks on this theme at several other places in India, UK and USA.



 I was supposed to give a talk on the topic at JNU during the International Vedanta Conference last year, but it was hijacked by a few charlatans who turned it into a sales meeting for selling a dubious product called Super Accelerated Learning Theory (SALT).



Best,

N.S. Rajaram
