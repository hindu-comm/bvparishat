Dear Dr. Trivediji,  
  
I understand that you equate hiraNyagarbha with the Higgs Boson and  
find DNA in the four-horned, three-legged, two-headed, seven-handed  
bull that is bound thrice.  
  
I would like to know what your spiritual-scientific equivalences are  
for the first 17 odd numbers (1 to 33) and the first 12 multiples of  
four (4 to 48). Obviously, I am referring to the anuvAka beginning  
with ekA ca me.  
  
Vidyasankar
