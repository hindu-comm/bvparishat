But I digress. Anyway, my curiosity about the methodology behind your  

interpretation has not been solved. It has vanished.  
  
Dear Vidhyasagarji,

revealed in trance or any thing else? I have followed scientific  
method and prepared a scientific terminology in systematic order.  
  
With regards
