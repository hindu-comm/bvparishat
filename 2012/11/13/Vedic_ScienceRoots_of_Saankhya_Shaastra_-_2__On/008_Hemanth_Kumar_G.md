There is enough content written by our Rushis in the name of Vaidhika Bhauta Shaastra which requires atleast 50 years to learn the outlines of the same. The modern day science & 99% scientists are just working just like puppets in a business model. Its all commercial, name & fame..  
  
Saankhya is not new or just 33000 years old. It is Crores of years old. Publicly available Saankhya is not original Saankhya at all.  
Ref. <http://veda-vijnana.blogspot.in/2012/10/roots-of-saankhya-shaastra-1.html>  
  
I don't see anything remaining to be INVENTED, all have been explained clearly in Vaidhika Bhauta Shaastra. Nothing is required to be derived by us. Everything is present in Shrauta tradition which are crystal clear. First we have to purify ourselves, aim towards only the welfare of the society & never use them for self, then just we have to understand their work by practicing in 10 different ways.
