Actually, the primary line of traditional vaidika interpretation, namely pUrva mImAMsA, does not at all say that the veda was revealed in a trance during meditation. And superstitions about one or another thing are also part of the universal legacy of civilized people all over the world.



"Scientific" or "rational" ways and means are not the only legitimate ways of knowing or doing things in this universe. When any act of creativity happens, there is a moment of inspiration involved, which provides an insight into reality that cannot be neatly reduced to logic nor dismissed as a meditative trance. But I digress. Anyway, my curiosity about the methodology behind your interpretionhas not been solved. It has vanished.



With best regards,
