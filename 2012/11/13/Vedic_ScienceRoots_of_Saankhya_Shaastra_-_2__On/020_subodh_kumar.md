Dear Trivedi ji,

Rain water according to modern science is said to have its own fingerprints , due to isotopes of Oxygen and Hydrogen. This lends water very important properties depending on geographical locations of the precipitations. I have been working on water in Vedas and wishto share with you my work in progress for more guidance from scientists like you.

I wonder if you have come across any indications of this aspect in various names of water found in Vedas?

With best regards,

Subodh Kumar
