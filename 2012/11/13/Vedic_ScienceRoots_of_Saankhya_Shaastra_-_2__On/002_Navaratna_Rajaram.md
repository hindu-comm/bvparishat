 I am currently working on a book on Vedanta and quantum physics but it is not mathematical. The focus is on metaphysics, especially the structure of reality as revealed by the two.



 Sankhya is not science but part of metaphysics, epistemology in particular. We must not confuse science and metaphysics.
