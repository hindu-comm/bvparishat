Sir,

I am just curious whether your interpretations of various Vedic references start from the verses in the Veda or whether they start from some scientific theory and then fit some verse that seems appropriate. After all, an interdisciplinary approach needs some starting point and my question is about your methodology. If it starts from the Veda, then I would like to know whether your interpretation stands on its own merit or if it is context dependent. If it starts from the current understanding of science, then I wonder how progress in science can ever happen from reading the Veda according to your approach.

E.g. It is all well and good to see DNA in the catvAri SRngA verse, but neither the molecular biologist not the pandit sees much use in it. The value proposition to each specialist is just not there. Besides, such an interpretation depends upon someone else's discoveries about DNA. If one could have predicted things about DNA by starting from the Veda verse, then that would have made your attempt to see contemporary science in the Veda a bit more plausible than it is today.

Hence my query - what science do you see/deduce in the odd numbers from 1 to 33 and the multiples of 4, up to 48?

Regards,  
Vidyasankar
