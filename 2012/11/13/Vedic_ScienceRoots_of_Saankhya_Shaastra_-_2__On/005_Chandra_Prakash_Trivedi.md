With regards  
  
Dr.C.P.Trivedi  
  
Shri Nava Ratan Rajaram is doing a great job to correlate Vedanta  
and physics,  
  
Mostly the people consider spiritualism and Science far  
apart, otherwise their approach is one and the same to explore reality. The  
ancient Indians have invented long back is hard to digest by the modern  
scientists who consider philosophy as different from Science, and beyond the  
sphere of physics. We are dwelling between symbolic terminology of duality non  
duality and Maya only. There is a need of Journal on 'Philosophy of Science and Science of Philosophy' to understand the modern and ancient work. Dr.C.P.Trivedi
