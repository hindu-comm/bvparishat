Namaste Hemanth Kumar,

  
  
The modern day science & 99% scientists are just working just like puppets in a business model. Its all commercial, name & fame..  
  

Please Don't generalise without having facts at hand. The above statemet of your is not correct.

  
  
"Saankhya is not new or just 33000 years old. It is Crores of years old. Publicly available Saankhya is not original Saankhya at all."  
  

The above sentence doesn't make any sense at all How can anyone else apart from yourself believe what Sankhya you say is original.  
  
Regards  
Ajit Gargeshwari

  
  
  
I don't see anything remaining to be INVENTED, all have been explained clearly in Vaidhika Bhauta Shaastra  

Then let all scientific institution close and we will here your pet theories
