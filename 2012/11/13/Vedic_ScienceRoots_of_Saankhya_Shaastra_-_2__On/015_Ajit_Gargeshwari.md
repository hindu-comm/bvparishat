Namaste,  
  
Hemanth Kumar and Dr. Trivedi have found genetic code in the Vedas where no such code exists lets congratulate them and move on. They say Hirnyagarbha is Hig Boson and Vedic hyms speak about DNA please accept their suggestion Allow them to live with their fantastic discoveries. They are the true embodiment of a "Gyani". "They have thus spoken".  
BVP has several important issues to discuss.
