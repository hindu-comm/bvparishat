I have suggestions -

  

Don'ts:

  

1\. BVP should not be used to justify so called sanskrit baby names

2\. BVP should not be used for dictionary query. If one wants translation, he should testify that he has tried all available online dictionaries before resorting to BVP

3\. Members should not post source queries without trying to find out on web.. The members should try to google search in Roman and Devanagari both before posting source queries.
