Namaste,  
  
I have a couple of points to add  
  
A topic should be raised that will increase knowledge of members, or will clarify genuine doubts. I don't know how relevant it would be to members or scholars, question such as what is the Sanskrit word for butterfly, flyover etc.  
  
Questions can be framed either in Sanskrit or English but they need to be clear. A line about the context from which the doubt arose, if added to the question will give members more material to give clear answers.  
  
When members need to know about the availability of a book the books complete title and author or subject matter of the book must be given. Please check online libraries such as DLI, archives etc should be searched before asking BVP. In several cases books are available on online libraries for a free download.
