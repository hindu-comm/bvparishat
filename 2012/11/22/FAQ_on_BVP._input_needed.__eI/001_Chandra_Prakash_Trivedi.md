Dear Pandurangji,  
  
The Sanskrit is mother of all language, and Vedas are in Sanskrit, I  
want to know why we are unable to interpret Vedas? there are many  
commentaries on Vedas but no one fully satisfy the quest to understand  
the Vedas, failing to interpret, the Vedas have been considered  
Apourusheya?  
  
We are living in a Scientific era, where revelation from cosmic source  
is a superstition. We should have consensus to interpret the Vedas in  
its original from first hymn and first verse of Rig-Veda to its last  
verse in chronological order.  
  
My personal view is that Apourusheya means beyond the common human  
wisdom, hence the {भारतीयविद्वत्परिषत्} is needed to give fresh call  
for interpretation of the Vedas, as a need for modern era.  
  
With regards  
  
Dr.C.P.Trivedi
