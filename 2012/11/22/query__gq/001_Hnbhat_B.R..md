Here is the translation I found on the web, in online कादम्बरी -

  

Salutation to that ‘Unborn one’;

who is the cause of the creation, maintenance and destruction

of the perceived world;

who has three Gunas (Sattva, Rajas, Tamas) as his nature;

who is the essence of three Vedas (Rk, Yajus, Saaman);

who (as Brahma)

is endowed with the quality of Rajas at the time of creating the world;

who (as Vishnu)

is endowed with the quality of Sattva

at the time of maintaining the created world;

who (as Shiva)

is endowed with the quality of Tamas at the time of dissolution.

for the benefit of other members also. Seems to be fine.

  

With regards
