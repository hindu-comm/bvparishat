If 'BVP' is to be really a 'parishat' then there should also be discussions on Vedanta as in other subjects.  
To depict the discussion on Vedanta related topics as 'skirmishes' is totally childish; this is not a bar or a pub where one involves himself in skirmishes.  
One cannot expect that others should completely accept without criticism whatever the earlier commentators have said in a system or should accept whatever one believes in.  
So long as objective approach is maintained in the discussions without any direct personal vilifications, they should be continued.  
If one is not interested in a particular view expressed by a member, he has the full liberty not to participate.  
On that reason it is not at all "scholarly" to put a blanket ban any discussion on Vedanta in 'the parishat'.  
For all said and done whether a person is Naiyayika or a Vaiyakarana, one is a believer in some form of Religio-Philosophy of the Bharatiiya tradition. More than believers, many of us have read the texts of various systems in their originals which naturally lead to discussions engendering differences of opinion and interpretations.  
Ganesan
