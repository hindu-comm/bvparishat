\> Dear Sir,  
\> I take immense pleasure in coming close to you through  
\> conversation about multi-faceted works of indology. Under my research  
\> Institute called Veda Vani Vitan, I have composed the books in plenty  
\> on diverse subjects like Sanskrit grammar and linguistics, philosophy  
\> and modern physics, ancient and modern mathematics etc.  
\> A comprehensive book called ' Bharatiya Darshan Tatha Adhunic  
\> Vigyan' is written under 5 volumes. The subjects like light, sound,  
\> states of substances, atomic theory etc. were dealt with. All these  
\> subjects were explained, arranged into chronological order and then  
\> correlated with modern science.  
\> On the subject of Sanskrit grammar and linguistics, a novel book  
\> called 'Indian Heritage as Reflected by Linguistics' is being  
\> published shortly at the service of scholars.  
\> To shed light on ancient and modern mathematics, a comprehensive  
\> book called 'Ganit Shastra ke Vikas ki Bhartiya Parampara' has been  
\> composed. With this book, all my endeavour is to highlight the  
\> formulae and theorems of ancient mathematicians as are virtually  
\> entitled to be known with their names.  
\> In the realm of history, art and culture, I have established  
\> 'Bharhut Art Gallery' to display the glory of Bharhut art. I have  
\> privilege of having taken hundreds of photographs of the images of  
\> Bharhut Stupa.  
\> With this letter, I request you to please take cognizance of  
\> these novel books. You may purchase them and make your valuable  
\> comments on them. You may arrange my informative lectures in your  
\> institutions on these most interesting topics. For detailed  
\> information, my websites '[vedavanivitan.com](http://vedavanivitan.com)' and  
\> '[bharhutartgallery.com](http://bharhutartgallery.com)' may be looked at. With best regards--  
\>  
\> yours faithfully  
\>  
\> Dr. Sudyumna Acharya  
\> Director-Veda Vani Vitan, Oriental  
\> Research Institute, Birla Road, Kolgawan, Satna-485001 (M.P.)
