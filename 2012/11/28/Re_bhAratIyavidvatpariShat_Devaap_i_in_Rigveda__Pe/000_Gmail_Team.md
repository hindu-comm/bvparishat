Dear Prof Narang (and other respected scholars), Namaskar!



It is nice to see your posting on bvparishat. You may be right. There could be more than one Devaapi



First I would like to thank Dr. D. Bhattacharya, Dr, Rajaram and Dr. Narasing Rao, for contributing to my query.



My reason for asking the question on Devaapi is as follows.



Pateepa-Devapi-brother Shantanu-son Vichitra Veerya-Dhritarashtra and Pandu-Kauravas and Pandavas. These are five generations.



Priestly line-Mitra-varuna-Vasis’tha-Shakti ( also Vyaghrapada)-Parashara-Krishna Dvaipayana Vyasa. These are also five generations



In both lines the number of generations match. In addition Pandavas' gotra was Vaiyaaghrapadya.

Devaapi appears in the late book of Rigveda.



Sudas and priest Vasistha appear in the Battle of ten kings. Could we then say say that Mahabharata struggle took place five generations after Battle of Ten kings?



These tribes in the western part of the ancient land of the subcontinent were fighting with each other even before Battle of Ten kings. At that time conflict was among tribes bordering Khyber pass area to Punjab. With development of horse chariots, the conflict got extended beyond Khyber pass in the land what we now call Afghanistan.



At the time of Mahabharat there were no names Iran and Afghanistan. These tribes were spread on the both sides of Khyber pass (Gaandhaara).
Please let us know your findings so that we can correct our own understanding. By the time of Yajnyavalky there was no trace of Paarikshtas. For Atharveda land of Vahlika, Mujavat in the west appear to be very distant. In the earlier Rigvedic time, there was knowledge of Kubha and Krumu rivers of Afghanistan.  



Your input is requested so that our mutual understanding could grow. Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
