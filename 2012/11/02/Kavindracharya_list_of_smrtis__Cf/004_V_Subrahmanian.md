I join you in appreciating the information contained in the PDF. I find that a number of works relating to Advaita Vedanta like the शतश्लोकी, स्वात्मनिरूपणम्, विवेकचूडामणिः are known even at the early part of the 17th century. There are opinions that these are recent works only attributed to Shankaracharya's authorship.

In the GaudapAdakArikA to the mAnDUkya upanishad we have this verse:  
  
वेदा इति वेदविदो यज्ञा इति च तद्विदः ।  
भोक्तेति च भोकृविदो भोज्यमिति च तद्विदः ॥ २.२२ ॥  
  
While Shankaracharya has no commented on a few of the verses in this section, the Anandagiri's gloss gives the meanings. For the portion भोज्यमिति च तद्विदः of the above cited verse he says: सूपकारस्तु भोज्यं वस्त्विति प्रतिजानते । तदपि न मधुरादिरसव्यञ्जनादेः तदैवान्यथात्वदर्शनादैकरूप्यसंभवादित्याह - भोज्यमिति चेति ।
