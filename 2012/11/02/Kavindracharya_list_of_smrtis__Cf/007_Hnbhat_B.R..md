I was able to download from the same link. It directly takes you to download and not to the [archive.org](http://archive.org) site on clicking the link.

  

If you are using IDM or any downloaders, which take the download, it will directly take it for download without opening the page.

  

  

  

Anyhow, if you want the page from [archive.org](http://archive.org) itself, here it is:

  

<http://archive.org/details/kavindracaryasuc00kaviuoft>  

  

  

The file itself is attached to this message, in case any problem, as required by you.
