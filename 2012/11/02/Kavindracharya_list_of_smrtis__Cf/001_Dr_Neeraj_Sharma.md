Dear Prof Pandurangi  
Best wishes for coming festive season. I saw two or more manuscripts of kavindracharya at shantipur (W.B.). I was on the tour with Prof. Ratna basu of calcutta university. She has conducted a survey of that repository. Prof prabhakar shastri told me about muslims attack. Pupils instructed by kavindracharya to bundled the Pothis and move fast in different directions. I think some of these manuscripts traveled up to Shnatipur or so far.NMM-MRC of Calcutta university can help in this regard.
