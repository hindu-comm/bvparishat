Dear sir  
i had heard from prof prabhakara shastriji that a list of nearly 500 lost smrtis in baroda library. Thiis list of works that were in the possession of kavindracharya a is ascribed to some student of that acharya in varanasi. During muslim attack somebody fled to gujarat with this library list to survive attack. List survived While the listed smrtis are lost in the process. Is it true?  
Can somebody send the pdf of list.
