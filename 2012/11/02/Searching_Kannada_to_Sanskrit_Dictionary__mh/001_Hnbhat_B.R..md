I have not seen any Kannada to Sanskrit Dictionary. For that, I don't remember anybody have compiled from Indian Languages to Sanskrit Bilingual Dictionary.

  

I am also interested to know about any such Dictionary from Indian Language to Sanskrit.

  

Sanskrit - Indian Languages Dictionaries are compiled. Sanskrit - Kannada Dictionary was compiled by a scholar सुवर्णकोशःSanskrit - Kannada Suvarna Kosha

by Bhat Krishna K Vidvan from whom I was blessed to learn Nyaya in my early days of Sanskrit Learning. But it doesn't contain Kannada - Sanskrit Dictionary, like Sanskrit - English, English - Sanskrit dictionaries.

  

Somebody might have compiled. If so I also would like to know of such Dictionaries.

  

With regards
