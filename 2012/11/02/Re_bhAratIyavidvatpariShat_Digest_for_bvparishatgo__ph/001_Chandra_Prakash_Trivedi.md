Dear Scholar friends,  
  
It is very interesting to see discussion on Sanskrit Grammar. The ancient Sanskrit is a symbolic language, where words have vast ocean of knowledge in the background besides its literary word meaning. The words have coded information, hence to save a mark (matra) in a sentence or word was celebrated just like the celebration of birth of a son. The ancient and Vedic Sanskrit is not looks so simple.  
  
For example the Saraswati is for Vac - thought and words, and we are searching the terrestrial river Saraswati on the earth?  
  
  
  
With regards  
  
Dr.C.P.Trivedi
