Namsakar to Scholars,

  

There are are issues but it is up the scholars to resolve them or at least justify their views in a logical manner. Just discarding some views because they do not fit into the individual's perception is not really going to help in any manner, rather than making blanket remarks.

  

Many of you may be aware of efforts at University of Austin to create a Critical Edition of R^igveda. This work have been in progress for few years whether anyone of the scholar from India likes it or not. When completed, this will automatically become the "Reference Text" for future generations. To me this is a serious issue !  

  

This forum has been recently discussing the number of LOST śākhā's from various various Veda. If we do not even have a list then how can one decide on the authenticity of any ancient text? If over 64 Sanskrit universities cannot unite then where are the novice Sanskrit lovers like me supposed to look towards!? Finally, scholar's from India will have no choice but to endorse the works of Westerners.

  

I urge Scholars to Admit, Evaluate the current status of Sanskrit and then unite to create something that will more meaningful to the future generations.  

  

We often blame Western scholars, but who really provided them with the original text and interpretations can never be forgotten. That was done by the Sanskrit scholars of that period. The Western scholars were not born in the Sanskrit atmosphere, but they did study and then arrived at their own conclusions. On one hand it is fashion to criticize them but Indian scholars are not doing sufficient efforts to document & justify their views. Many Indian scholars still use Griffith & Wilson and quote verbatim translation found on the internet ..  

  

IMO - We lost the ancient text because we and our immediate forefathers forgot the "Application of knowledge" (viniyoga) to their respective current periods. It is universal principle that things automatically get lost as the utility starts to fade away from the picture. This is from what is known as the "Information Theory" which simply states, "Information that is certain in the beginning tends to become uncertain with the passage of time." This has happened to our Veda and we need to acknowledge and find a way out. Novice like me are only good for asking the questions from outside the box as we are not conditioned to stay within the per-conformed ideas.  

  

Even on this list of esteemed scholars, only questions that get asked are often limited to locate some specific quotation or a text. This is indeed a great service Prof Korada, Prof Bhat and Narayanan er, Dr Bhattacharya ....... (just to name a few) and my sincere thanks to them enriching my understanding of Sanskrit in general.  

  

My apologies to the list for getting on the "Soap Box".

  

With best respects to all the scholars on the list,

  

Dr Yadu
