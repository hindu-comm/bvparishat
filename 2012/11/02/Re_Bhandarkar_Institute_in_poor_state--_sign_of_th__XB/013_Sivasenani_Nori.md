I cannot agree more with Sri Vidyasankar on this matter of metrical restoration.



One background information might be in order.



Early Vedic readers (i.e. books) puzzled over the fact that the way sandhi is applied or not applied in Vedic suktas ismarkedly different from the way it is applied in non-Vedic literature. A hypothesis was developed that poetry of the Vedas came first and the paaNDitya of grammar - especially the ability to define sandhis tightly - came later. Thus till the time anukaramaNis were written and the then-form of the various Vedic texts frozen by various Parishads etc., the Vedic texts kept on changing in terms of the application or otherwise of sandhi. Then, apart from changes in the language (the key basis for fixing the time of Vedas, constructed in the form of Max Muller's "I would give about 200 years for the language of the Samhita to change to that of the BraahmaNas; another 200 to AraNyakasand so on"), an arachaeology of the Vedic corpus based on sandhi/non-sandhi within the context of chandas would be another way of finding the time of composition of Vedic texts.



The metrical restoration project has to be seen as a concrete step in carrying out the above agenda. A very interesting by-product, notwithstanding whether there would be anything concrete regarding the time of composition, would be that it would give a concrete base, based on "scholarship", to one more argument to show that Vedas are indeed paurusheya. With the metrically restored version available,if one acceptsit, it amounts to admitting that the Vedas as known today are not valid, and hence the conclusion that Hinduism isbuilt on false foundations;if the metrically restored version is rejected, then, it amounts to revelation being imperfect - either metrically, or by way of sandhi.So much the better for evangelism. Also, a totally corrupted text of the RigVeda, backed with the prestige of a Western University,would throw a nice spanner in the works and hopefully help Hinduism decline.



I hope such projects are seen without naivety and rejected by all those who value Truth.



To those who seek an answer on what would bethe position of the believervis-a-vischandasand sandhi in the Vedas,those who actually believe enough in Vedas to devote the best years of their life learningthem, say something likethis: "My father/guru taught this to me; his father/guru to him - and, so on.It was not taught in any other way. Hence one must conclude that itis without beginning, always present. Anyway, \*\* I \*\* and people like me (i.e. the ones who spent the best years of my life learning the Veda) believe that it is beginningless, and that it is True and Perfect in all respects, as it is. All Sastras explain the Vedasas well as they can, but are subsidiary to the Vedas. As Yaska says about Vyakarana in Nirukta, one might achieve perfection or might not achieve perfection in propounding any Sastra. That does not mean that Vedas are to be judged using one of those Sastras."
