Dear Dr. Navaratna, and Dr. Yadu,  
  
I feel your zeal and devotion for Sanskrit and Vedas, kindly use your skill of wisdom to bring out a critical edition of Rig-Veda in the light of modern Science for future generations. The South India has the lust for Sanskrit, but they are suffering from Hindi phobia, and politics. Maharshi Sandipani Veda Vidhya is also under the politics now, they have no regards for national interest.  
  
With regards  
  
Dr.C.P.Trivedi
