*November 2, 2012*



 I see this part of the collapse of Western Indology worldwide, including Cambridge (UK), Harvard, Berlin, etc. (I know, I have visited most of them for lecturesin the past few years and told them the same thing.) Like Indology, they were colonial products created to serve the interests of colonial rulers. They have outlived their usefulness. Instead of changing and adopting to a new environment, they have continued to peddle colonial myths and stereotypes. Worse, they have adopted a bunker mentality and lash out at anyone questioning them.



Now BORI (Bhandarkar Institute) wasbuilt on the same assumptions as Western Indology centers. It produced outstanding work, most notably the Critical Edition of the *Mahabharata.* But this was due mainly to the brilliance of individual scholars like the late V.S. Sukthankar rather than institutional excellence.



It is still a treasure house of rare manuscripts and other priceless works, but it cannot go on as if nothing has changed. There have to be institutional changes-- something like the British Museum and Library.



Otherwise BORI will become as irrelevant as the Berlin Institute of Indology and a host of others now on their way into the dustbin of history.
