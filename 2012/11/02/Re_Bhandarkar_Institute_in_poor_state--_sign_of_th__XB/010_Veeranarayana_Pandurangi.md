Dear all,

I request all of us to concentrate more no real issues rather than simply quarrelling with each other or simply blaming the western schoars for everything that is wrong.

  

As we saw many members blamed BORI for its wrong doing. But we should understand and learn to respect BORI has done. for those who dont read sanskrit BORI is nothing. it matters for those who have read and enjoyed the good publications for BORI.

  

If it is being in a bad condittion today it is our fault. We need to bring it into very good shape. who else will care for it. it is our corruption/neglect or whatever. we need to overcome and make institutions like BORI stand and fight for the nation. Yes. BORI was established on the principles of western indology. but who cares about western indology now. we need to preserve our heritage and publish all the unpublished manuscripts there. We need BORI. we can not shrugg of it from our shoulders. sorry for the statement of Shri Rajaram.



We need to study Vedas scientifically yes. I agree. but we need to do critical editions etc. also. we can not get it off. I hope we start working rather than simply debating.

अथ चेत्त्वमिमं धर्म्यं संग्रामं न करिष्यसि।

ततः स्वधर्मं कीर्तिं च हित्वा पापमवाप्स्यसि।।

तस्मादुत्तिष्ठ कौन्तेय युद्धाय कृतनिश्चयः।
