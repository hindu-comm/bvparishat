After all Veda is Shruti.... Navaratna Rajaram,Critical Edition of the Rigveda?  

they are only "Grammarians" and have not desire to explore further.  
  
  

Dear Dr. Yadu,Dr. Rajaram and others,  
  
You are right those who understand the meaning of Vedic words, he become his father's father. The Vedas have been preserved through oral traditions, the science incorporated in the Vedas is originally achieved with experiments about 18000 years ago. The scientific knowledge has been explored in metaphors and riddles, where the words are having vast ocean of knowledge in the background. The metaphors are for teaching and riddles are for examination. The seers were head of the contemporary institutes and universities.  
  
The son who is a sage hath comprehended: who knows this rightly is his father’s father Rig-Veda 1-164-16

The interpretation of the Vedic hymns has been the great puzzle for the scholars. The authentic tradition of understanding the Vedic samhitas can be discerned to have been available at least as far back as the Nirukta of *Yaska*. The *Yaska* holds a prominent position among the commentators. He has given his commentary in *Nirukta*, he has used *Nighantu* for explanation of the words. The *ÿgvedic* deities have been described in *the Sarvanukramani* of *Katyayana,* It is an index to the *Rigvedic mantras*, *NÏtimanjarÏ* another commentary provides an idea about the social customs and tendencies of *the Rigvedic* period.

When these indexes were prepared the Science was not developed so much, hence they were unable to include scientific terminology or scientific interpretation. Now we have touched the height of Vedic Civilization, and we can interpret the symbols and Rig-Veda in terms of Science. The modern scholars are unaware about modern Science hence you observe "Most of the Grammarians I have come across tend to go into their own shell and avoid to comment on the trying to explore the meaning and application by announcing that they are only "Grammarians" and have not desire to explore further."

  
  
Could that be the reason why Shankaracharya openly taunted the scholars "

*नहि नहि रक्षति* डुकृञ्करणे "  

Critical Edition of the Rigveda?  
  

You are scientist alright, only scientists can understand the meaning of Vedic words, who have the knowledge of that particular phenomena and reaction with reference to the metaphor. The Vedic seers have used symbolism to express the knowledge, even primary Sanskrit can do better.  
  
With regards  
  
Dr.C.P.Trivedi
