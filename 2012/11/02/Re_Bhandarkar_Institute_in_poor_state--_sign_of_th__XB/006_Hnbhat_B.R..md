I think Abhinavabharathi, who criticized and revised the opinions of earlier writers to establish his theories, submitted without any knowledge of science like now as:

  

चित्रं निरालम्बनमेव मन्ये प्रमेयसिद्धौ प्रथमावतारम् ।

सन्मार्गलाभे सति सेतुबन्धपुरप्रतिष्ठादि न विस्मयाय ॥  

  

acknowledging his indebtedness to his earlier commentators and his attempt is to restore the original thing in their place properly.
