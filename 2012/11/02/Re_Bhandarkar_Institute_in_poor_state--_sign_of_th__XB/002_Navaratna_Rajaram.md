 Establish fundamental principles for the study of ancient India and don't fall back on colonial era sources.



There was no science in those days, and what there was they didn't understand. Luminaries like Max Muller believed in the Biblical Creation Theory and also the Tower of Babel, etc for languages.



 So it is not just colonial hangover, it is also bad science. Today we know natural history, population genetics and the like. Has BORI taken the lead in any of this? The last time I was there, a respected scholar was still parroting the 'No Horse at Harappa' rubbish though he admitted it was not true!



 We plan to have conference on new foundations for study of the ancient world based on these new findings. We expect it will be in early 2013.
