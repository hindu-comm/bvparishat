Dear Colleagues,

The principles of modern Indological research have never been clearly spelt out but nobody has claimed that modern research should be made in aid of colonialism. Its eclectic or at least amorphous character is testified by the rise of Indologists like Csoma di Körösi, Hermann Jakobi, Böthlingk, Minaev, Stcherbatsky or Ryder (USA) who had no attitudinal meeting point with an overtly racialist and imperialist scholar that H.Oldenberg had finally turned into. It is very difficult to accept that scholars like Kane, Dandekar etc. were anything but nationalists. I also found the critical attitude of Palsule, Devasthali and Laddu very much enlightening and without colonial attachment.

It is one thing to speak of the alien attitude of some Western Institutes and quite another thing to see that in an Indian Institute of repute after sixty five years of independence. The illusion is very unfortunate.

Philological principles and methods are sometimes spoken of. But that does not mean anything necessarily connected with colonialism. It demands that one should have an historical and critical outlook/approach with the implication that everything said by the sages need not be accepted as correct. If this is objected to then even Dayanand Sarasvati has to be decried. That is unacceptable.

Best
