 But BORI must change with the times. What does BORI stand for today? No person or institution can afford to take the attitude "The world owes me a living."



 I have a concrete suggestion. Wht not organize a week workshop to define the criteria for preparing a critical edition of the Rigveda? First, what do we mean by a critical edition? Unlike with the Mahabharata, which is plagued by interpolations, the Rigveda is in pristine form.



 So what is the critical version going to look like? Is this a destructive suggestion?
