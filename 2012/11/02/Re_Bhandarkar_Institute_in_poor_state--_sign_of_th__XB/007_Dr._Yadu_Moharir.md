Namaste Dr Trivedi,  
  
Thank you for taking my comments in spirit. Would that be OK if I call on you for for some technical help is sourcing some related manuscripts and your take of some interpretations that I have been working on at present ?  
  
My sincere concern is most of books on various suuktaa are literal translations and authors rarely venture into applying the concepts to the present. I can probably give you more than couple of hundred such books (literal translations). These scholars do use PaNiiniiya grammar but fail to relate the ancient concepts to the present because they cannot see beyond their discipline. How wonderful would that be of Sanskrit scholars start interacting with inquisitive scientists who are brought-up in traditional atmosphere but chose the science as a career. Most of the Grammarians I have come across tend to go into their own shell and avoid to comment on the trying to explore the meaning and application by announcing that they are only "Grammarians" and have not desire to explore further.  
  
Could that be the reason why Shankaracharya openly taunted the scholars "*नहि नहि रक्षति* डुकृञ्करणे "  
  
I firmly believe in dīrghattamā's statement and which been my staff when I read and try to understand vedic suukta., per say. My approach is to look at the potential application to the present times.  
  
ऋचो अक्षरे परमे व्योमन् यस्मिन् देवा अधि विश्वे निषेदुः .  
यस्तन्न वेद किमृचा करिष्यति य इत्तद् विदुस्त इमे समासते .. ऋग्वेद. १.१६४.३९ ..   

dīrghattamā while praising veda he says comments (liberal translation) - Gods reside in vedic ṛcā. But if one does not understand their meaning then what is the use of such veda for him? One who realizes this; lives together with understanding stays in a harmonious society..  

  

As a hard core scientist I firmly believe on the importance of applications  

अज्ञेभ्यो ग्रन्थिनः श्रेष्ठा, ग्रन्थिभ्यो धारिणो वराः ।  
धारिभ्यो ज्ञानिनः श्रेष्ठा, ज्ञानिभ्यो व्यवसायिनः ॥ मनुस्मृति १२१०३॥  

  

Liberal Meaning - Someone who has studied a little is better than totally ignorant. Someone who has memorized them are better than someone who knows a little. One who knows the meaning is superior to those who memorizes. However, one who practices it is certainly the most superior.

  

Could this be the reason why SaayaNaacharys called Brahmins as "sthaanu"

  

Suggestions, corrections and advise from all scholar's in most welcome.

  

Again thank you for taking my concerns in the proper spirit.

  

Best Rrds

  

Dr Yadu  

  

PS: Next time I am in India will certainly look you up.
