 I do not feel qualified to work on a critical edition of the Rigveda or any Sanskrit work. I have no traditional schooling and have always been a Western trained scientist. (Even in science I was more an industrial than academic scientist.)



 From that perspective my question is what do we mean by a Critical Edition of the Rigveda?



 My suggestion is to have a workshop of scholars representing a wide spectrum tocome up withbasic criteria to be followed for criticism-- ritualistic, mystical, etc.



 Next can we separate the text from chanting? After all Veda is Shruti. These are questions to be discussed. But we will certainly learn a lot.



 Perhaps BORI should take the initiative in this. It may infuse some life into it.



Sincerely,

N.S. Rajaram
