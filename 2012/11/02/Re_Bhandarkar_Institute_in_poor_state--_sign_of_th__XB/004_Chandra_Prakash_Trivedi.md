**There was no science in those days, and what there was they didn't understand. Luminaries like Max Muller believed in the Biblical Creation Th and also the Tower of Babel, etc for languages.  
**

**University of Austin to create a Critical Edition of R^igveda........To me this is a serious issue !  
**

**forefathers forgot the "Application of knowledge" (viniyoga) to their respective current periods.  
  
**

**Many Indian scholars still use Griffith & Wilson and quote verbatim translation found on the internet .. 64 Sanskrit universities  
  
  
Dear Dr. Yadu Moharir,  
  
You have raised really serious issues regarding Rig-Veda and Sanskrit , not only the Bhandarkar Institute, but most of the oriental centers including the 64 universities are in the sphere of politics. The devoted scholars** **Prof Korada, Prof Bhat and Narayanan er, Dr Bhattacharya
....... and many are only the name among these institutes, where the post is political, and I feel sorry to say that they have no broad vision, they are moving only in traditions.

****W*e do not know science, hence we can say that they were also unaware about Science,** The Western scholars were not born in the Sanskrit atmosphere, but they have real zeal to know the ancient culture of India, they have done more service to Sanskrit, besides their self interest also *Luminaries like Max Muller believed in the Biblical Creation Th and also the Tower of Babel, etc for languages. ***They have used their critical wisdom, and we are confined to traditions.  
***

**University of Austin can bring critical edition of Rig-Veda, but we have no critical vision and will not support it also.  
**  
******You have said "forefathers forgot the "Application of knowledge" (viniyoga) to their respective current periods."  
No Sir we have forgotten to use Science.  
  
****The Sanskrit is not a common ordinary language, as considered by our modern Sanskrit scholars, and the Vedic language is coded language, it is beyond their imagination, how they can work, and why they will promote others for critical work?  
  
With critical and scientific interpretation they feel inferiority complex.  
  
The Vedas are books of Science and the Sanskrit is symbolic language, we are interpreting it just like Hindi. **  
**  
I have all the experience of all the modern scholars.  
  
1. The Vedic Cell Biology 2. Vedic Concept of Biosphere and four books have been published by Lap Lambert Germany.  
  
1. Vedic Geeta Indus Vedic Genetics Indus \_Vedic Civilization 3. Quest of creation Higgs Boson God particle and Vedas 4. The Waste land Aim of life  
  
It is due to the critical work on Rig-Veda. The devoted Sanskrit scholars have to think beyond traditions also, otherwise the skill with which Sanskrit and Vedas have been preserved by our seers can be hijacked by the western scholars. Once our ancestors were not ready to teach Sanskrit to Mallechchh why? because it has the secret of Indian culture, through it at any time India and we can revive our old glorious past.  
  
With regards  
  
Dr.C.P.Trivedi
