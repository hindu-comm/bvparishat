Respected Professor Subrahmanyam Sir,

It is nice to read your article titled: The Perception of Conciousness According to Bhattamata. Not much of the articles on the Mimamsa school are populated through this BVP. This innovation from you is to be highly appreciated.  

The Vedic statement: sa eṣa yajñāyudhī yajamāno'ñjasā svargam lokam yāti-which goes beyond the sensual perception, as the terms-añjasā yāti- might be aiming that after the performer's death there in no time he yields the heaven, or theoretically he has already have a berth in heaven in no time. The utensils used for the sacrifice also put on pyre along with the performer when he dies and till then he keeps those for daily practices, in such a way the sacrificial fire is maintained as kept it alive and from which the pyre-fire is to be lighted. There is dramatic scenario quoted in the Dhvanyaloka which similar to this as the warriors see their wounded body, while they pass their soul up on to the heaven well treated by the damsels, but physically tortured by the jackals; as those read:

भूरेणुदिग्धान्नवपारिजातमालारजोवासितबाहुमध्याः।  
गाढं शिवाभिः परिरभ्यमाणान्सुराङ्गनाश्लिष्टभुजान्तरालाः।।  
सशोणितैः क्रव्यभुजां स्फुरद्भिः पक्षैः खगानामुपवीज्यमानान्।  
संवीजिताश्चन्दनवारिसेकैः सुगन्धिभिः कल्पलतादुकूलैः।।  
विमानपर्यङ्कतले निषण्णाः कुतूहलाविष्टतया तदानीम्।  
निर्दिश्यमानांल्ललनाङ्गुलीभिर्वीराः स्वदेहान् पतितानपश्यन्।।

  

The confrontation between the Vijnanavada and Icchavada has presented very nicely, the Buddhist are being successfully refuted on the argument of existence of vijñāna after the death, as Kumarila's statement: it is akin to a clan due to unending chain and in a long term basis which does not demand any actor (kartā kaścin na labhyate).

The references on the works like Sabarabhasya, Slokavarttika and Parthasarathi's Sastradipika are given, invites the readers to read and understand more on this regard.

Thanks, Sir, for the article, as kept it saved for a detailed reading sometimes in future.

Regards,  

Narayanan
