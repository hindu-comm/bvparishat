Namaste ji,

  

It is said that the Vedas have not gotten corrupted even for a matra since so many years, and this is possible because of various techniques adopted to preserve the correctness of the Vedas. One of these techniques is Chhand, which keeps a count of the complete letters in a given Mantra.

  

By the logic given by the learned, **two different mantras of a given Veda having same Chhand would have same count of complete letters.**

  

In the quest of digitisation of Vedas and comprehensive checking / cleaning exercise, I have started to count the letters of the Mantras of the Rig Veda. What came to my surprise, is that the above rule / logic does not hold good in many cases. A sample of such Mantras is listed in the attached file. May be there is some additional rules / logic which needs to be seen in parallel.

  

I request your guidance in understanding the noted inconsistency. Else request you to direct me to someone who would be an expert in this field.

  

Regards,

Virendra Agarwal
