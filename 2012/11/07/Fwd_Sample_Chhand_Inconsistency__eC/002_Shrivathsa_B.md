hariH OM,  
shrii agarwal,  
  
 The mantra 7.34.17 is indeed gAyatrii. The reason is the following:  
The qualification for a mantra to be gAyatra is for it to have 8 letters in its first pAda. In this sense, the mantra has 8 letters. So is the next mantra etc.  
  
 Similar rule for triShTup where the first pAda should have 11 akSharas, similar for jagatii where the first pAda should have 12 akSharas.  
  
 It may be worthwhile to study pi\~Ngala ChandasshAstram before embarking on this task of classifying / "cleaning up" etc. However, this is just a suggestion.  
  
svasti,  
 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,  

shrivathsa.
