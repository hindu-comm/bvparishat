Dear Dr. Sati Shankar Dutta,  

  
Thanks for the mail. The Pali term "anattaa" stands for "anaatman", the notion of not-self. The term "sabbe" is a substitute for "sarve" (all -in masculine geneder of the pronoun sound sarva). It is: "sabbe dhammaa anattaa" (all the dharmas are anaatman). Buddha's speech like: "na sabbe sabbam jaananti", the term "sabbam" stands for "sarvam", a neuter accusative singular in Sanskrit, which will be further numbering as: saravam sarve sarvaani (same as in nominative and accusative), the more falling down could be: sabbam sabbe sabbaani. Here the second "sabbe" is dual of neuter in accusative and nominative. The masculine plural "sabbe" stands for all human beings, although the form being the same. In the same way Pali being a falling down dialect (apabhramsha) of Sanskrit should be read on the context of syntactical features of Sanskrit. The plural term "anattaa" attributes the plural term "dhammaa" due to the homogeneity in gender and number. Similarly, "sabbe sankhaaraa dukkhaa" is a substitute for "sarve samsaaraah duhkham" (all bondage is grief) in Sanskrit. The Dictionary of Pali Proper Names by G.P. Malalasekera (1899-1973) could be referred, which I hope will be covering the Sanskrit substitutes as well. "Attaa", (aatmaa) alias "aatman" may be somewhat not acceptable in Buddhist approach, while "dhamma" is accepted. Apart from the Dhammapadam, the many texts like: the Khagga-visaana-sutta, the Pacittiya-vannana, the Maggaa-magga-Naanadassana etc. speak about: "sabbe sankhaaraa dukkhaa", "sabbe sankhaaraa aniccaa" and "sabbe dhammaa anattaa". Here, the term "aniccaa" stands for the Sanskrit: anitya (non-eternal). Here it is to understand that the bondage is taken as compound which is temporary while the "dhamma" although being "anattaa" (anaatman), is eternal "nitta" (nitya). In some texts, the commentators are not the culprits, but the English interpretation makes confusing, simply because of lack of concepts in its vocabulary. So, Sanskrit is well an appropriate tool to analyse Pali than English.  
Regards,  
Narayanan
