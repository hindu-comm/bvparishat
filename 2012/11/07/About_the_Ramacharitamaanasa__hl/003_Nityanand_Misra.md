हेराई, तहूँ, महूँ, छुहे, काजु are words used only in Awadhi in very specific meanings, somebody unfamiliar with Awadhi can never get the fine meanings of these words. लुप्तसप्तमी is used in Awadhi in only certain contexts. All this is as difficult for a non-Awadhi speaker to understand.  
  
Anybody is free to interpret, but are the interpretations any reliable?
RCM is not a सरलग्रन्थ. Expounders of Manasa speak for nine days on a single Chaupai and Facebook posts or S P Tata's site is hardly a reliable source. If somebody copy pastes text from Peace TV or IRF's website to interpret Vedas, I cannot help them, and similarly I cannot help you if you rely on these sources.  
  
I will give you a good source - for an evaluation of all interpretations of Tulsidas's view on the world, please read Uday Bhanu Singh's well researched books तुलसी and तुलसी काव्य मीमांसा. Published by Rajkamal Prakashan, New Delhi.

The author and you seem to be unaware of Satkhyativaada in Ramananda tradition. The above interpretation contradicts many verses in RCM and Vinayapatrika including सीयराममय जग, तुलसिदास परिहरै तीन भ्रम, तुलसिदास यह चिद्विलास जग, et cetera. Tulsidas is a Siddha Vaishnava, and does not indulge in Al Taqiya to say one thing at one place and soemthing contradictory somewhere else.  
  
Please read the article attached which addresses not just this, but all examples of rope-snake and world-dream analogies in the RCM. I do not need to say this, but this comes from somebody whose mother tongue is Awadhi, who has been composing Awadhi poems for 59 years in his lifetime of 62 years, knows each and every word and usage of Awadhi, whose life is devoted to RCM having done 5000 आवृत्तिs of the epic, is the editor of a crticial edition based on 27 editions, knows all the works of Tulsidas, and is considered an authority on Tulsidas and Ramanandiya philosophy by many authors. This is not to boast or bias the reader, bur only for the reader to know the author better, just like most books or scholarly articles have a small introduction of the author.  


Upto you to decide if you want to rely on Facebook, \*pedia, astrology websites, some random blogs or articles like this.  
  
This is the end of discussion from my side.
