Namaste  
  
The 'Ramacharitamaanasa' is a work studied, recited and expounded by followers of the sampradaya-s, both Vaishnavas and smarthas.  
  
I found the following references on the 'Ramacharitamaanasa' authored by Sri Goswami Tulasidas ji:

Tradition ascribes the authorship of Adhyatma Ramayana to Veda Vyasa, since it is an integral part of the Brahmanda Purana. This work in Sanskrit, which has more than 4,000 verses, presents the story as told by Siva to Parvati. In fact, Tulsidas' Ramacharita Manas is based on it. If the style of narration sounds more puranic, with Siva responding to Parvati's questions, there is a greater accent on philosophy of the Advaita school and on Bhakti.

Although Tulsidas was above all a devotee of Rama, he remained a follower of the more generally accepted traditions and customs of Hinduism rather than a strict sectarian, and his poem gives some expression both to orthodox monistic Advaita doctrine and to the polytheistic mythology of Hinduism - though these are everywhere subordinated to his expression of bhakti for Rama.

Tulsi, should not, however, be considered partial to Rama in exclusion to others. He appreciated the diverse tenets of Saiva, advaita and samkhya philosophies.

The works of Tulsidas are about Sri Ram, with two exceptions: [Krishna](http://www.hindupedia.com/en/Krishna "Krishna")-gitavali and Parvati-mangal. Tulsidas’s magnum opus, the Ramcharitmanas, is the story of Sri Ram retold in mellifluous language—an outburst of bhakti based on his own spiritual experiences. Although the origin of the Ramcharitmanas lies in the Valmiki Ramayana, its immediate source is the Adhyatma Ramayana. What are the differences between these two Ramayanas? The Valmiki Ramayana is ancient, has 24,000 verses, and depicts Rama as the epitome of ‘human’ perfection. The much shorter Adhyatma Ramayana, a part of the Brahmanda [Purana](http://www.hindupedia.com/en/Purana "Purana"), is of a later period. It depicts Rama as Brahman itself, and is an excellent confluence of Advaita [Vedanta](http://www.hindupedia.com/en/Vedanta "Vedanta") philosophy and the Valmiki Ramayana.

Among others, Tulsidas did teach *Advaita* at the core of his approach.
  
  

### Vedanta, World and Maya

In the Sundarkand of Ramcharitmanas, Tulsidas says that Rama is knowable by [Vedanta](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedanta "Vedanta").^([\[125\]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsidas#cite_note-124)[\[126\]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsidas#cite_note-125))

^([  
](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsidas#cite_note-125))

<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsidas>  

As per Tulsidas, Rama is the efficient and material cause (*Nimitta* and *Upadana*) of the world, which is real since Rama is real.^([\[127\]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsidas#cite_note-singh-jagat-126)) In several verses of the Ramcharitmanas, Tulsidas says that the animate and inanimate world is a manifestation of Rama, and the universe is the cosmic form of Rama. Authors interpret these verses to mean that the world is real according to Tulsidas, in keeping with the [Vishishtadvaita](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vishishtadvaita "Vishishtadvaita") philosophy of [Ramanuja](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramanuja "Ramanuja").^([\[128\]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsidas#cite_note-127)[\[129\]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsidas#cite_note-128)[\[130\]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsidas#cite_note-129)) However, at some places in the Ramcharitmanas and Kavitavali, Tulsidas compares the world to a night or a dream and says it is *Mithya* (false or unreal). Some commentators interpret these verses to mean that in Tulsidas' opinion the world is unreal as per the *Vivartavada* doctrine of [Adi Shankara](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adi_Shankara "Adi Shankara"), while some others interpret them to mean that the world is transient yet real as per the *Satkhyativada* doctrine of Ramananda.

Prasad 2008, p. xv: Probably the most marvelous thing about the life of Tulasidasa... is his capacity for assimilating diverse tenets, Vaishnava, Shaiva, Advaita, Sankhya, etc.

Prasad 2008, p. xx: ... the *Ramacharitamanasa* interprets the period allegorically and from the Vaishnavite angle of a poet who "attempted to reconcile the Advaita Vedanta point of view with the Ramaite teachings of Ramananda's disciples".

Both Tulsi and Tunchan were drunk deep in the Nondualit (Advaita) philosophy of Sankara. The essence of the philosophy is that Jeeva and Brahman are one and the same, but what gives them separate identities is “Maya” (the Eternal Illusion). The concept of Maya has been elucidated by both poets with the help of the serpent–rope metaphor–“The world is an illusion but it is taken for real as a piece of rope is mistaken for a snake”. Up­holding this concept both poets have underscored the transience and nothingness of life. Tulsi has compared it to a dream in which one lives a happy and splendrous life in a palace but everything fades into nothingness as he wakes up. Ezhuthachhan has driven home the idea by striking a few similes–wayfarers assembling in an inn to spend a night and dispersing, pieces of driftwood floating in a river, water contained in an unbaked earthen pot, etc. It is difficult to ascertain who has excelled the other in delineating the Maya concept.  

The above is only a sample.
