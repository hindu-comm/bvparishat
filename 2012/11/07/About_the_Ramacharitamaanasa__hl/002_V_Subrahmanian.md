I do not think to get to know the meaning of RCM one needs all that great scholarship in Awadhi. I am not claiming proficiency to write pages in that language but with a reasonably good Hindi and Sanskrit it is not difficult to decipher the meaning of a certain verse as shown below for example. (highlight only to identify my reply)

I am only showing the perfect concordance between the RCM and the Bhagavatam. There cannot be a disagreement in this matter between the two:  
  
RCM BAlakAnDa Doha 111 chaupAI 1:  

##### झूठेउ सत्य जाहि बिनु जानें। जिमि भुजंग बिनु रजु पहिचानें॥  जेहि जानें जग जाइ हेराई। जागें जथा सपन भ्रम जाई॥1॥ भावार्थ:-जिसके बिना जाने झूठ भी सत्य मालूम होता है, जैसे बिना पहचाने रस्सी में साँप का भ्रम हो जाता है और जिसके जान लेने पर जगत का उसी तरह लोप हो जाता है, जैसे जागने पर स्वप्न का भ्रम जाता रहता है॥1॥

(I copied the above from a Facebook entry as I could not get the fonts right when copied from the <http://www.astrojyoti.com/pdfs/ramacharitamanas/bal98-165.pdf> . (Gorakhpur) But I did cross check the reading. The translation, however, below, I could copy from the pdf.)  

//—“Due to lack of knowledge about RaŒma even the unreal passes for real, just as ignorance about a rope leads us to mistake it for a snake. Even so the moment we know Him the world of matter vanishes, just as the delusion of a dream disappears as soon as we wake up.//  
  
Compare this with the Bhagavatam verse (which I did not quote in my earlier mail):  
  
In the Srimadbhagavatam is a verse on the mAyA-nature of the universe explained with the rope-snake analogy:  
<http://vedabase.net/sb/10/14/25/>  
  
आत्मानमेव आत्मतया अविजानतां  
तेनैव जातं निखिलं प्रपञ्चितम् ।  
ज्ञानेन भूयोऽपि च तत्प्रलीयते*  
*रज्ज्वां अहेर्भोगभवाभवौ यथा ।। 10.14.25   

//A person who mistakes a rope for a snake becomes fearful, but he then gives up his fear upon realizing that the so-called snake does not exist. Similarly, for those who fail to recognize You as the Supreme Soul of all souls, the expansive illusory material existence arises, *but knowledge of You at once causes it to subside. //*

The *third line* 'ज्ञानेन भूयोऽपि *च तत्प्रलीयते’ *specifically teaches that 'through Knowledge the falsely projected duality ceases' which is nothing but ज्ञाननिवर्त्यत्वम्. The rope-snake analogy too is significant in the above RCM and the bhAgavatam verse. And the dream being termed a 'bhrama' which means 'unreal' in the RCM (not something that is real but only temporary as claimed earlier).

Sri Ramakrishna had great regard for Tulasidas. I see no difference in their approaches to mAyA, just as there cannot be a discordance across saints of the sanAtana dharma following.

I am surprised by your comment. I had not claimed that the article is on RCM. I have heard this bhAvArth of this episode narrated by numerous upanyasakas in different languages. I remembered that and gave a google search and found the above. I did not even say that this is from the RCM.

Not necessary. This very thread which deals with the Advaitic nature of the RCM gets even more substantiation from the Vivekachudamani verse which is in concordance to the Vinayapatrika verse cited on the status of the world in Tulasidas's doctrine.

That for Tulasidas the world is unreal is evident from his own words cited above. Otherwise there is no need for it to 'vanish' upon Self/Brahman realization. He even uses the famous rope-snake illusion analogy to demonstrate the world-illusion and the subsequent removal of the illusion through knowledge. If he sees the world as सीताराममय and bows to it, it is the same as a Jnani looking upon the world as Brahman and venerating It everywhere, in everything यो मां पश्यति सर्वत्र सर्वं च मयि पश्यति (भ.गी). Since Brahman is nirAkAra, It appearing in the various names and forms is due to the mAyAshakti. Brahman cannot appear without the shakti. So, in a world-appearance/perception Brahman and the shakti together are involved.

That is ok Misra ji, I had noticed your name on that page and am glad about it. I do not see the content there involving references to the Advaitic nature of RCM a distortion for I am convinced from the RCM's sample cited above for its genuineness.
