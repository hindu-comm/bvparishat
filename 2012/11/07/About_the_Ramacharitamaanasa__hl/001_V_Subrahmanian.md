Dear Sri Misra ji,  
  
I would only say, in agreement with what you said about 'endless Advaita-Vaishnava debate' in deciphering the Shruti, in the case of the Ramacharitamanas too. All that you say about knowledge, or the lack of it, of language, grammar, etc. on the part of a commentator is the common 'menu' in such debates.

In the following verse of the BhAgavatam (UddhavagItaa 17.55) we have the illusory nature of the world-objects described:  

अर्थे हि *अविद्यमाने *अपि संसृतिः न *निवर्तते*।  
ध्यायतः विषयान् अस्य स्वप्ने अनर्थ आगमः यथा॥५५॥  
//Even though the sense-world (of objects/subject and perceiving) is unreal, अविद्यमाने अपि, the relative existence of a man who dwells on sense-objects is never at an end, as troubles come in dreams. (Since dreams are admitted to be effects of the impressions of the waking state.)//

The BhAgavatam, again, in the uddhavagItA chapter 23 verse 32 teaches:

**यदि स्म पश्यत्यसदिन्द्रियार्थं , नानानुमानेन विरुद्धमन्यत् ।**

न मन्यते वस्तुतया मनीषी, स्वाप्नं यथोत्थाय तिरोदधानम् ॥३२॥

//Even if the illumined man sees the objects of the outgoing senses, he does not consider them as something real and other than the Self, because they are rejected by inference on account of their *multiplicity* - *as a man, on waking from sleep, dismisses the vanishing dream perceptions.* //



Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, a bhakta of Mother Kali, mahAmAyA, has said: there are two forms of mAyA: avidyA mAyA and vidyA mAyA. The former binds. It is by taking refuge at the feet of the latter that one is released. I do not know if the following is from the pen of Tulasidas, but oft quoted:  
  
<http://media.radiosai.org/journals/Vol_02/06March15/02_Cover_Story/PearlsRamayana.htm>  

**ON MAYA**

You are also being told a few things about Maya. Just as our own shadow will always accompany us and will not separate from us, so also Maya will always accompany God and will not separate from Him. There is a very good illustration of this fact in the Ramayana. At the time Rama, accompanied by Lakshmana and Sita, was moving in the forest. The forest was a thick one and there were no wide roads and they could only follow a narrow path; the way they were walking was such that Rama was going in front, immediately behind him was Sita, and Lakshmana came behind Sita. In this way, all the three, Rama, Sita and Lakshmana were moving forward along a narrow path. In order to be able to recognise and understand this situation, you hold up your three fingers. The first finger represents Rama, God or Paramatma. The second finger immediately behind represents Sita or Maya. The last finger in this row of three, represents Lakshmana or the Jiva.

Paramatma, Maya and Jiva, these three are going along in a narrow path in the wild forest of life. After a little while, Lakshmana, whom we have symbolised as Jiva, has got the desire and the ambition to have a look at God or Paramatma. What is it that he has to do in order to fulfil his desire? There are only two ways of looking at Rama or getting his darshan. One is for Sita, who is in between, to move away a little and let Lakshmana have the darshan of Rama. Alternatively, if Sita insists on staying where she is, Lakshmana has to move aside a little. To get Sita to move away, he may have to push her out from the place where she is standing, but then he will be offending Rama. So what Lakshmana did was to pray to Sita in all humility and ask her to give him a chance of having darshan of Rama. Sita, in all her graciousness and in all her kindness, said, “Yes, certainly you can have the darshan of Rama,” and just stepped out a little. So if you get angry with Maya, and if you want to use force and your own strength on Maya and push her out of her place and then have the darshan of the Lord, you will not succeed. Maya then will play tricks with you. Not only that, God will not allow such a thing to be done. The only way, therefore, to fulfill your ambition is to recognise that Maya is the inseparable shadow of God Himself and pray in all humility and ask for an opportunity by which Maya will stand aside.



> 1.  In the Vinayapatrika Tulsidas clearly says कोउ कह सत्य झूठ कह कोउ >     जुगल प्रबल कोउ मानै । तुलसीदास परिहरै तीनि भ्रम सो आपुन पहिचानै । >     (Vinayapatrika stanza 111). *"Some (the Dvaitins) say the world is >     real, some (Advaitins) say it is unreal, while some >     (Dvaitādvaitins) say it is both real and unreal. Tulsidas says >     those who leave all these three illusions truly know themselves."*

This is a fine expression of the 'अनिर्वचनीयख्यातिः’ where the illusory phenomenon cannot be asserted as 'real' (सत् चेत् न बाध्येत) or 'unreal' (असत्) असत् चेत् न प्रतीयेत. So it is given a different category called 'सदसद्विलक्षणम्’. A verse from the Vivekachudamani would be relevant here:  

सन्नाप्यसन्नाप्युभयात्मिका नो

भिन्नाप्यभिन्नाप्युभयात्मिका नो।

सांगाप्यनंगाप्युभयात्मिका नो

महाद्भुताऽनिर्वचनीयरूपा ॥१०९॥

  

It (*Maya*) is neither existent nor non-existent, nor both; neither same as Brahman nor different nor both; neither made up of parts nor whole nor both. Most wonderful it is and beyond description in words.   
  
So all vAda-s such as sat, asat and sadasat are to be transcended. That is the essence of the words of the stanza.

It is to be known that all schools hold the world to be not independent. In Advaita the world is 'not apart from Brahman', in other words, it has no existence independent of Brahman. In Dvaita it enjoys a 'paratantra satyatva'; the सत्ताप्रदः for the world is Brahman/Vishnu. So, it has no existence of its own; it has to always exist on the borrowed existence from Brahman. In Vishistadvaita the Lord is सर्वशेषिन् and the world therefore is शेषः. It is quite reasonable that all schools agree that the sheSha cannot have an existence apart from the sheShin. Since the world cannot manifest by itself without the support of the sentient entity Brahman, it is 'ब्रह्ममायामयः’. It can take names like 'सीताराममयः, लक्ष्मीनारायणमयः, पार्वतीपरमेश्वरमयः'. In the Bh.Gita the Lords says: मयाध्यक्षेण प्रकृतिः सूयते सचराचरम्, मम माया दुरत्यया, मम योनिर्महद्ब्रह्म तस्मिन्गर्भं दधाम्यहम् , etc. All give a relative reality to it and do not brush it away as non-existent.

The 'pedia' has over a hundred source-references to its article and several other references.
