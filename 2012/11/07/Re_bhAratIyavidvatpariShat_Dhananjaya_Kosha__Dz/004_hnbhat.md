I have already downloaded. It is the same as in the reference and 1950 Editon.

  

Here is the same in Google Drive:

  

<https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B-ueXU4do-o_YUxjS2t3aGZSck0>  

  

pdf format. You can find in the folder some more lexicons I had downloaded. I remember there is one ekakshari kosha in Dhaval's Sanskrit world.

  

<https://docs.google.com/folder/d/0B-ueXU4do-o_NGpFenQ5T2hSTGs/edit>  

  

Here you can find some more lexicons in the folder which is made public share.

  

With regards
