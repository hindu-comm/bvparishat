Respected Scholars,  
  
This verse about Ganga by Sankara contains first she was deposited in Brahma's Patra or Kamandalu. From which Purana this idea of Ganga being in the Patra of Brahma is taken?  

**Aadhaavaadhi pithamahasya niyama vyapara pathrejalam,**

**Paschath pannaga sayino bhagwatha padhodhakam pavanam,**

**Bhooya shambhu jata vibhooshana mani jjahnor maharsheriyam,**

**Kanya kalmasha nasini bhagwathi bhagiradhi drusyathe. 5**

****

**This Goddess brought down by King Bhageerath,**

**Was initially seen as the water of worship from the pot of Brahma,**

**Later it became the purest holy waters washing the feet of Vishnu,**

**And then became an ornamental gem on the head of Lord Shiva,**

**And then later was born as the daughter of sage Jahnu.**
