Dear Colleagues,

I could not follow Nivedita Khandekar’s report. The first excavator J.Marshall had dated the Indus cities as between 3100 and 2700 BCE. Post-independence research fixed the date between 2300 and 1900 BCE with exception of Mohenjodaro that disappeared around 1750 and the Lothal-Rangpur Complex that survived a little more.This is an approximate statement that may be improved, Still, even on this basis I could ask --Wherefrom did the 3700 BCE date come?

Chanhudaro and allied cultures are older than the Harappan but a genetic connexion has not been proved. At most they could be successive with or without living continuity and cultural survival. But one cannot be the genealogical socio-culural precursor to the other like say, the later PGW and the NBPW.

Much depends on proven cultural continuity which may establish identity as opposed to just survival as in sites like Hastinapura where the final (ACE 1300+) layer gave evidences of the Sultanate that were not genetically connected to the previous stages.

Since I am not a professional archaelogist some of the terms may sound uncommon. But, I hope, the meaning is clear.

Best
