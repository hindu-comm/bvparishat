Witzel,  
  
 Superb scholarship indeed. Anyone who has even a cursory look at your "Harvard oriental series" number 57. i.e. Samaveda Samhita of The Kauthuma School. Just to remind you that you had edited this masterpiece . An amazon link may help remind you:  
<http://www.amazon.com/Samaveda-Samhita-Kauthuma-Harvard-Oriental/dp/0674005880>  
  
 For any editor worth his salt, he should at least make sure that the book has no typos. But then, you are a superb scholar and whatever typos you leave behind become the new vocabulary of "sanskrit".  
  
 As far as non-scholars like me are concerned, we want our money back! We cannot tolerate your "scholarly" "sanskrit". The book that you have produced is a despicable piece. Too bad, you had to sully the name of shrii BR sharma for your aggrandizement by producing this hotch-potch.  
  
 Professor of Sanskrit, Editor of "Harvard oriental series"... hohohohohohahahahaha. You make for such a pathetic sight!  
  
Shrivathsa. B.
