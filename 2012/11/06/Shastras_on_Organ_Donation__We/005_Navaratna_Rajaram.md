 I fully agree with Sri Ganesh. We should use our judgment based on humanistic considerations and not blindly appeal to "shastra". Otherwise we will be no better than Muslim fanatics.



 Acharya Shankara said "Shastra is not the word of God, but the result of jnana (thought) and karma (experience)." Madhva said things similar. We should never appeal to any authority in decisions but use our judgment.



 Poet Dante said humans are the only creation endowed with judgment. That is what makes us human. Let us not give it up in the name of shastra.
