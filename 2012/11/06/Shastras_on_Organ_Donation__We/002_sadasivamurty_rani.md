It may not be possible for me to immediately find sources from Dharma sastras with regard to Avayava dana but in the puranas some instances we can come across.  
1. In the Hayagriva Upakhyana while fighting with the Demon Hayagriva, lord Vishnu was very much tired and took rest for a while keeping the other end of his Divine bow under his chin. To wake Him up Brahma created white ants. Those white ants cut the string of the bow and as result the bow became tension free and due to the forceful hit of the other end of the bow Vishnu was beheaded. The demon Hayagriva had a boon that he would be killed only by a warrior who should also have a Horse head. So The Gods searched for a horse and having killed it brought its head and fixed it to  
the head of Lord Vishnu. Here head transplantation is illustrated.  
2. It was the head of Demon Gajasura on the request of GAJASURA fixed to the trunk of Vighnesvara.  
3. It was the head of a Goat fixed to the trunk of Daksha Prajapati  
4. The young prince Pururava donated his fresh youth to his father Yayati.  
In this manner there are instances of such head transplantation or Youth transplantation etc., in the puranas.  
What soever may be the reality of these stories a recommendation or a thought of transplantation and a thought of donation of avayavas can be seen in those pauranic texts.   
Warm regards,
