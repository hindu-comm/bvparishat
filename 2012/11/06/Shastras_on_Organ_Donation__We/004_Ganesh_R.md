Those who oppose eye-donation, blood donation, body-donation etc.,on  
the alleged basis of their non-vedic or anti-vedic stand should not  
avail any help or treatment form the modern medicine a policy. If not,  
such discussions will only serve as idle curiosity. I personally feel  
that for all these mundane things one should not drag the  
dharmashastric works as all these come under the section of  
viSESha-dharma and this is bound to change in the course of dESa and  
kaala. If not air-travel, sea-voyage, self-shaving, Brahmin working  
under some other authority for lively food, trading many things like  
salt, oil and a score of several hundred vidhi-nishEdha-s have to be  
literally followed. If spirit is the only way then such discussions  
find their natural end.
