Respected scholars.  
Namaskar. I follow with deep interest the scholarly discussions and am thankful to all of you for the sharing of precious knowledge.Sirs,  
I have been watching a serial by Sanjay Khan: MahArathi KarNa. The birth of Karna as I have known it thru some reading from Mahabharata and small books for children attracted my respect for Gods and devotees..I accepted the birth of Karna as a gift from God without any sensual connotation.But after watching the serial I am really shocked.Sirs, can you please explain to me -- the significance of Durvasa's boon, reason behind Karna's birth, whether he was conceived biologically and was born as any human being? Or here also there is some medical explanation.Thus I will be able to understand the birth of the PAndavas  
Thank you  
Malti

**Subject:** Re: {भारतीयविद्वत्परिषत्} Shastras on Organ Donation  

To add to the examples below we have the case of  
  
1. The sage दधीचि who donated his bones to the देवs to make the वज्र to kill वृत्रासुर, this comes in the Mahabharata  
2. The king शिबि who cut off his own body parts to save a शरणागत pigeon who has Agni in disguise from a kite who was Indra in disguise  
  
All these acts are considered the greatest त्याग. Organ donation is ultimately परोपकार and can be seen in the light of  
  
अष्टादशपुराणेषु व्यासस्य वचनद्वयम्  
परोपकारः पुण्याय पापाय परपीडनम्
