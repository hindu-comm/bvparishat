Hari OM!



sarvebhyo namaskāraḥ,





I have been reading quite a lot of material on Organ Donation recently.
My curiosity increases when people talk for and against

in the light of shastraic injunctions. What is the truth? Is there shaastraic prohibition and if so from what authoritative sources?

If shaastra is silent do we take it as granted? or, otherwise?



I would welcome scholarlyanswers and referencesfrom our distnguished members.
