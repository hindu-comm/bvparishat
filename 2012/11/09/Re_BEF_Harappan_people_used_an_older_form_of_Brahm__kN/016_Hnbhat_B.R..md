What about ऋषि-s producing from the body of वेन, the king पृथु?

  

It seems they had managed to create clone of वेन from his the gene extracted from his dead body, if we are believe it as an episode of history or scientific fiction?

  

Vishvamitra, created गायत्री mantra for सन्ध्योपसन, the topic discussed in another thread, was able to create another world for त्रिशङ्कु his pontiff king, who also belonged to his race क्षत्रिय.

  

These can be taken as explanation, if we believe the maxim,

  

"इतिहासपुराणाभ्यां वेदार्थमुपबृंहयेत्।"

  

as pieces of information contained in Veda-s or historical writings as such.

  

Now that Genetics has managed to restore the lost heritage in 18000 years and here is our saviour scientists of our heritage.

  

यम यमि concept is also the other side of the same coin of Puranic Mani and his wife, which represents there was no culture of family of husband and wife rigid so far, if taken for historic event. Both are we are told brother and sister, and this incompatibility from our present day society, can give rise to any scientific speculation.

  

Anyhow, I hope we will get our 18000 years old culture restored by our Scientists in its original shape, disfigured for generations, and decoded for the use of our future generation of Scientists, (even if the traditional scholars may hesitate to accept such interpretations).

  

I am for myself, neither Scientist nor Indologist for that matter to evaluate. Nor scholar of Sanskrit, beyond Panini and Vyasa.

  

With best wishes
