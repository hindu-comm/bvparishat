Dear Dr. HnBhat,  
  
Thanks for your critical analysis.  
  
Vedas have long tradition to interpret in its proper form. Mostly have followed the Sayan's commentary, and Puran Brahaman Upnishad and Aranyak. They could not go beyond the imagination of Manu and his wife first gene. It has been adopted in the Bible as Adam and Eve.Now at least after 18000 years we have touched the height of Vedic civilization, hence we are in better position to interpret the Rig-Veda, from Rig-Veda the things have been modified as per the contemporary situation, and the requirement in Brahamaa literature, Upnishad, and Purana etc.  
  
Actually in the Vedic culture there was no fear of hell-heaven, God or Soul, they were living in harmony with nature. The formless creator is the supreme and source of all.Afterwards it has been interpreted as Brahma in Upnishad.  
  
  
The first chromosome is termed as Yama Yami, it has been evolved from Tvashta DNA, and with genetic recombination the whole biological world came into function as a system. The infinite nature Aditi is working every where, Whatever is and whatever will be is nature only.  
  
With regards  
  
Dr.C.P.Trivedi
