It has do everything with everything with Caturvedi as he himself is Vedin (Knower - both has got 4 veda-s and Scientist).

  

Very fine conclusion as I can see. There is a saying

  

"यो यत्रानुरक्तः स तदन्यतिरस्कारेण तदेव बहुमन्यते।"  

  

So it is natural to look with the color of the glass one wears, everything that comes in his sight, unless he wants to change his color glass. None is to be blamed for his sight. Each sees according to the color of the glass he wears, as I can see from the postings in the group.

  

And, there is another very fine concilliatory verse who boldly declared:

  

  

साहित्ये सुकुमारवस्तुनि दृढन्यायग्रहग्रन्थिले तर्के वा मयि संविधातरि समं लीलायते भारती ।

शय्या वाऽऽस्तु मृदूत्तरच्छदवती दर्भाङ्कुरैरास्तृता भूमिर्वा ह्रदयङ्गमो यदि पतिस्तुल्या रतिर्योषिताम् ॥ '  

  

that one has to understand the view of the others without partiality:

  

क्रमेलकं निन्दति कोमलेच्छुः क्रमेलकः कण्टकलम्पटस्तम् ।

प्रीतौ तयोरिष्टभुजोः समायां **मध्यस्थता नैकतरोपहासः ॥ ६.१०४॥** (नैषधीयचरित)

  

I am not translating the verse as these are popular among Sanskrit Scholars and may be meaning nothing, even if translated.  

  

"Let each enjoy his favorite view without making fun of the other." is the policy ironically put forward in the highlighted text.

  

With regards
