\<The each symbols has a meaning, just to capture the symbol is not sufficient to narrate the text behind the symbol. It is not a script symbol.>

It may seem strange but M.Witzel-Steve Farmer & Co hold exactly the same view as expressed in the last sentence above. They hold that the Harappan signs do not belong to a script but are just symbols. And they stop short of explaining what they symbolise. I think that this view is unscientific and untenable. Time permitting I like to publish a paper on the absurdity of the view propounded without application of mind and without consideration of possibilities and impossibilities.
