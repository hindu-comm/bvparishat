You also talk of genetics in vedas. But does not seem the case. Vedas have something different to tell. They speak off brahman.  

  

Genetician also speak off brahman, the first gene from which Manu the first human being was created. You call it as Brahman, while other call it with different names, which is not within the scope of Genetic Encoding, our Trivedi, after Brahman, the Created decoded for his first creation, is decoding for the second time. This seems the point emphasized by Trivedi, as I can observe from his postings in every topic, whether related to Veda-s, Harappan Civilization or Sanskrit Language (a weak decoding system invented by Panini in colloboration with Yaska). This is the idea I got from his writings in this forum.

  

Following his idea-s, Brahma, who we call Creator God, decoded first the Genetic Principle, and created the world of inanimate and animate animals, Gods and created the whole world through the first human creation Manu and his wife, dividing himself. (as reported by Manu). Now somewhere, somebody decoded and were able to decode other than Brahma, and were able to create out of the gene dead body of वेन whom the sages were able to transform to dead body and to fulfill the need of a ruler in his place, created पृथु. So it was decoded by others. And another revolutionist, विश्वामित्र decoded गायत्री mantra and was able to create another स्वर्ग for his disciple त्रिशंकु, when he was denied place in स्वर्ग created by ब्रह्मा. So afraid of these counterfeit attempts, he encoded them in Genetic Encoding to keep his authority in tact as the Creator God. This was done in the Harappan age, which is much later than the Vedic Ice Age and was stored in tablet format. Then it is being decoded for the first time by our Trivedi. Both the Veda-s and the Harappan Tablets, containing Genetic Engineering, which we call सृष्टिरहस्य - the secret of creation. This seems to explain the history of our cultural heritage, like many other hypotheses, in view of Trivedi's explanations.

  

After a long time Panini and Yaska tried their best, with the encoding system of natural language, which we respect and consider as the essential parts of वेद studies, now considered as वेदाङ्ग. जैमिनि and बादरायण further complicated the subject matter, following the decoding system called Sanskrit, provided by Panini and Yaska, and explained in their own way, dwelling on semantics side of the same system. This was followed by our आचार्यपरम्परा differing in opinion among themselves, up to आर्यसमाज, अरविन्द and modern commentators and are not agreed upon the interpretation of Veda-s. कपिल and काणाद followed a different type of tool, developed from the one by Panini and his followers to deal with Sanskrit Language.

  

Thus our Trivedi's interpretation finds its place as the first decoding after Brahma encoded them for his purpose and prevent their misuse by others lie AYI devising their PIE tool and their followers. So all of them failed because it was encoded in Genetic Encoding and invited Genetic Engineer to the scene. Some Scientist tried decoding Vedanta to some extent, by Quantum Theory, which does not include the संहिता portion. Some others tried to read Astro-physics into Veda-s and some others Astronomy and Astrology into Veda-s. Now it is the turn of our Trivedi. The same forum welcomes his new his ideas, with varying responses according to one's inclinations.
