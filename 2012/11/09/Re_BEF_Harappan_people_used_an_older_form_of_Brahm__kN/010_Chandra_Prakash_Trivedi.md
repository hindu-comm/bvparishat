Dear Sir,  
  
Symbolism can be used any where with reference to the context by the narrator, the script is made up of sign used to express the message or text in detail. The words can be used as symbol, where the words are having vast ocean of knowledge.  
  
Just for example clarified butter and milk. Clarified butter is essence of milk. The clarified butter is the symbol to express the essence.  
  
The script can be changed with time, but the symbols to express the phenomena will remain as such. Hence Vedic seers have used symbolism. The symbols can be expressed in icon or in script as words.  
  
Please see my book Indus Vedic Genetics Indus Vedic Civilization, you are a great scholar and can comment on it also. Published by Lap Lambert Academic publishing Germany.  
  
With regards  
  
Dr.C.P.Trivedi
