Dear Hnbhat B.R.

You are right.  

If one is able to grasp the real meaning, he will touch the height of the forefathers in knowledge.

Upon what syllable of holy praise-song as 'there their highest heaven the Gods repose them ² who knows not this, what will he do with praise-song? But they who know it well sit here assembles Rig-Veda 1-164-39

They told me these were males though truly females: he who hath eyes sees this, the blind discerns not.

The son who is a sage hath comprehended: who knows this rightly is his father’s father Rig-Veda 1-164-16

In the same fashion at another place, the mechanical chanting of the praise songs has been compared with the awakening of the frogs at the beginning of the rainy season. The seer compares the din of their croaking with the chants of priests, and the clamour of pupils at school repeating the words of their teacher. It has been considered as a satire on the Brahmans, who do not know the purpose and meaning of the Vedic hymns. The pupil learn the lesson from their teacher and mechanically reproduce it, just like the year brings the rain in due course of time and fertilize the soil, in the same fashion the Adhvaryu - sage will come forward to explore the hidden truth Rig-Veda 7-103

*Resting in a silence for a year, As Brahmans practising a vow,*

*The frogs have lifted up their voice, Excited when parjanya comes,*

*When one repeats the utterance of the other,*

*Like those who learn the lesson of their teacher,*

*Then every limb of yours seems to be swelling,*

*As eloquent ye prate upon the waters,*

**

*These Brahmans with the mighty soma offering,*

*Sit round the large and brimming vessel talking,*

*So throng ye round the pool to hallow*

*This day of all the year that brings the rain-time.*

*These Brahmans with their soma raise their voices,*

*Performing punctually their yearly worship;*

*And this Adhvaryus, sweating with their kettles,*

*These priests come forth to view, and none are hidden,*

*It has been interpreted as a satire upon the Brahmans. But it is only to draw the attention of the pupils, that only the chanting of the praise songs is not sufficient, go into the depth of Vedic hymns, *

Thanks with regards
