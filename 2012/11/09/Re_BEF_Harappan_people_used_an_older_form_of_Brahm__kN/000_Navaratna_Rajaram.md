 *Mirable dictum!*



 **THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT THE LATE NATWAR JHA AND MYSELF SAID AND WROTE MORE THAN TEN YEARS AGO.** We also said that Harappan was Proto-Brahmi (I coined the term) andits language as related to Vedic Sanskrit, and style close to the Sutras-- all this was a consequence of the very close Vedic-Harappan connection.





 We summarized all this and gave both a methodology and hundreds of readings in our book ***The Deciphered Indus Script: Methodology, Readings* (2000, Aditya Prakashan).**



**** Our book contains tables comparing the Harappan with noth only various Brahmis (it is not a single script) but also West Asiatic ones like Aramaic.



 This demolished the Aryan invasion and the Aryan-Dravidian divide. It threatened also to demolish the reputation of the likes of Michael Witzel and Romila Thapar.



 So they launched a personal attack on Jha and me in the friendly pages of the Communist mouthpiece **FRONTLINE.** They (Witzel and Farmer) didn't analyze our methodology, but in the characteristically Witzelian fashion attacked us personally, charging that we had fabricated the image of a horse-- which had nothing to do with our decipherment. As he always does, Witzel tried to divert attention from the substance by accusing us of being motivated by 'Hindutva'!



 Witzel then went on a **"propaganda blitz"** (in his words) to discredit me and Jha (who died not much later) to save his theories (and reputation) from extinction. he failed at both though he was aided generously by the Leftist media-academic clique (including Amartya Sen).



 The claim was 'No horse at Harappa'-- meaning since horses were unknown in India before the invading Aryans brought them, any reference to horse including our supposed horse image was a fabrication! So Harappan language cannot be related to Sanskrit!



 This was a blatant falsehood as both horse remains and horse icons have been found in Harappan remains. It is now known that horses had been domesticated in India long before they appeared in Eurasia or West Asia.



 We should see Witzel and his ilk for what they are-- propagandists, not scholars. All sort of people got into the controversy including supposedly well-wishers who advised me to withdraw our claims. Jha and I refused, but decided to withold publication of our results until Witzel had been exposed and a more friendly climate for scholarly exchange prevailed. Unfortunately, Jha died in 2006. He is the most brilliant scholar I have known and I have known many.



 Time might be right to bring out our second volume now. **(For Dr. Biren Jha: Finally, justice seems to be in store for your father's great achievement. NSR).**



 D.P. Sharma must be the same as Deo Prakash Sharma who used to be at the National Museum in New Delhi. I spent afair amountof time with him discussing our decipherment. Jha, Frawley and I contributed at least three articles (it may be four) for a two-volume work on Vedic and Harappan civilizations that Sharma edited.



 I may now go back to completing the work that Jha and I had begun.



 Now that Witzel has been largely defanged, I will get to work on the successor to the earlier volume that Jha and I had planned. My advice to young scholars: ignore political activists acting in the name of scholarship. They are no better than religious frauds-- secular pious frauds.



 I am grateful to D.P. Sharma and others for keeping an open mind and not swayed by loud propaganda coming from a supposedly 'prestigous' institution (where he is now a *persona non grata* especially after their propaganda campaign against Dr Subramanian Swamy. See the pattern: he attacked Swamy also for being pro-Hindu!)



 Once I am done with my current program, I may also write a short book detailing my personal experiences.
