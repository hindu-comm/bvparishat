 The word 'symbol', relating to symbolism is not the same as the script. The symbolism is contained in the iconography while the script is made up of the signs used in the messages. We made it clear in our book that the script which is neutral must be seen as distinct from the symbolism which is intimately tied to the Vedic culture.



 shortly before his death Jha sent me additional material on the symbolism.



 Witzel - Farmer views are not to be taken seriously as they are driven by Hindu hatred and want to deny the Vedic-Harappan connection because it demolishes the Aryan invasion. They are just engaged in gossip.



 Please wait for my book.
