Dear trivediji  
It seems you are raising some intersting point. I am reminded of a joke with a caricature of a indus man telling other man about how his tablets would be driving the researchers crazy in future.  
Offcourse everything is possible. But as we see today indus tablets do not seem to be mere symbols. Why would be the entire indus would be having so many symbols? Was it a nuclear lab to keep these genetic secretes away from russion spies? It seems not. Then you quote your book always. Nobpdy would be able to read a book published in germany. Please make a copy available to all the members of bvp. So they can read and judge it.  
You also talk of genetics in vedas. But does not seem the case. Vedas have something different to tell. They speak off brahman.  
I am not ridiculing your reseaRch.  
I am simply expressing my thoughts.
