Respected Nityananji,  
  
Tha varna is not a caste, it is mentality with which a parson act in the society, it is his identity in the society, Brahamin is he who guide the society by his wisdom and knowledge with sacrifice of comfort,Kshatriya is he who defend the society and land by his physical strength and sacrifice his life for the motherland, the Vaishya is he who defend the society by business with ethics to supply goods for life, and sacrifice his wealth for motherland. Other wise all are born as Shudra without knowledge. With education and wisdom they acquire their place in the society.  
  
You can see this division of labour in a office also officer incharge head of the institutes as first class officer, subordinate second class executives, Clerk third class officer and peon-servants fourth class officer.  
  
The four bases have been described as four horns symbolically, and the triplet code as three head, two strips as two head of the DNA double helix and the bonds in between the triplet nucleotide pair, with which the DNA acts in the living-beings are just like his seven hands. The function of DNA depends on the triple bond of hydrogen in the mortals. The mighty DNA has entered into mortals, which is moving from generation to generation.  
  
With regards  
  
Dr.C.P./Trivedi
