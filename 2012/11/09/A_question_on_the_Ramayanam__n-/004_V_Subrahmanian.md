But the next verse is even more specific:  

|                                                                                    |     | |:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:---:| | [3-18-04](http://mghariharan.wordpress.com/2011/08/21/misjudges-5-in-fun/#31804In) |     | |                   *अपूर्वी भार्यया च अर्थी* तरुणः प्रियदर्शनः \|                   |     |
