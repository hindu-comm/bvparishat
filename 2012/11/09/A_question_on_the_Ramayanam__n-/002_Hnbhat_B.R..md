*वरिवस्या तु शुश्रूषा*परिचर्याप्युपासना ( २. ६. ८८२)  

  

Anyhow, I could not follow the total discussion and the problem.

  

What I could understand from Mr.Nitanandaji's reply, it was about some verse/word containing the सन्नन्त form of "श्रु श्रवणे" - which is the obvious meaning of hearing or listening (though in English both used with different connotations). The meaning of attend to the words (of somebody) is directly derived from the सन्नन्त and makes it quite obvious.

  

It is quite popular in Kannada, the verb keLu is used in the sense to follow, though it is used in the sense to hear. In his Hindi also the same verb, is used. Simply please listen to my words and hear my words make much difference. So the simple श्रु also could be used in the sense, unless the hearer is not deaf, the other man automatically hears
during the conversation between two or three. Hence it can be taken as to obey also, whom should I obey, with लक्षणा. One could hear the words of both, and there is not any need to raise the question as the questioner is not a deaf man as the context makes it clear as the question is asked in the middle.

  

This is what I got the gist of the problem as replied by Nityananda Mishraji.
