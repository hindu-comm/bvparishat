In continuation of my earlier post, here is another episode: The meeting of Shurpanakaa with Rama, etc. in the forest.  
  
I have heard of this episode narrated by many. Could the scholars pl. evaluate it in the light of the Ramayana and its commentaries:

Rama chuckled ( काकुत्स्थः प्रहस्य). Rama explain he is married\[ [3-18-02](http://mghariharan.wordpress.com/2011/08/21/misjudges-5-in-fun/#31802Out)\] and recommends Lakshmana to her\[ [3-18-03](http://mghariharan.wordpress.com/2011/08/21/misjudges-5-in-fun/#31803Out)\] as unmarried (अकृत दारः). Many Rama bhakthas cannot take Rama telling lies even in jest. Givindaraja makes a mess of this word and tries to explain. Srinivasa Shastry rebuts it as unethical as the recipient Shurpanaka does gets cheated. Whether Rama intended it or not.
