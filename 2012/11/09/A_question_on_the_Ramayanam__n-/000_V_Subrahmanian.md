Namaste  
  
I came across the following episode from the Ramayanam:  
  
<http://www.indiadivine.org/showthread.php/705646-AcArya-rAmAmRtam-%28from-SrI-ra%E2%80%99nganAtha-pAdukA-dt-Oct-09-Part-3%29>  
  
I request scholars to pl. let me know if this is based on the Valmiki Ramayanam and whether the explanation is found in any commentary thereof.  
  
Regards

rAma leaves and asks sumantra to bring the chariot. He gets on the chariot and  
sits down. vAlmIki shows how they all get on the chariot, who sits in the front  
etc.  
  
They are all up; chariot starts to leave. daSaratha takes a peek.  
  
He calls sumantra saying, 'Drive the chariot slowly. That way, I can keep  
seeing rAma for a while.'  
  
tishTheti rAjA cukroSa yAhi yAhIti rAghavaH !  
(ayodhyA.40.46)  
'Stop, stop.'  
  
rAma -'sumantra, keep driving, keep driving; this is how everyone will be  
crying. They will be fine after a while' .  
  
daSaratha - 'Stop the chariot' .  
  
sumantrasya babhUvAtmA cakrayoriva cA'ntarA \|  
(ayodhyA.40.46)  
sumantra does not know what to do. Should he listen to daSaratha or rAma? He  
looks like he is caught between two wheels.  
  
rAma -'Go, go' .  
  
sumantra - 'He is asking me to stop' .  
  
rAma - 'Let him keep saying' .  
  
sumantra -  
nASrausham iti rAjanam upAlabdhoo'pi vakshyasi \|  
(ayodhyA.40.47)  
When I come back tomorrow, he will ask me why I did not listen to him and why I  
was driving fast; what will I do?  
  
rAma - 'Tell him you were not able to hear what he was saying. If he gets  
angry at you, just tell him you did not hear him.  
  
nASrausham iti rAjanam upAlabdhoo'pi vakshyasi \|  
  
So, sumantra agrees and keeps driving the chariot.  
  
rAma is asking him to lie! rAma is a personification of truth! This is a black  
mark in rAmAvatAram.  
  
Criminal act declares that encouraging and stimulating someone to lie is a  
bigger crime than lying.  
  
There is more severe punishment for one who induces and provokes someone else do  
the killing. There are criminal procedures like Act 137, 144 etc. That act  
ordains higher punishment for the inciter of the plan, do you know?! It is  
lesser punishment for the killer; and more severe one for the instigator of the  
crime.  
  
rAma asked sumantra to lie! Is this right?  
  
We lie everyday. No one bothers about us. rAma never lies. It is a blemish if  
a person who never lies says even one lie, right?  
  
rAma asked sumantra to say â€œnASraushamâ€ .  
  
It means, Did not hear .  
  
It can mean 'the ear did not hear'. Another meaning is, 'did not listen to what  
you said \[did not obey you\]'.  
  
What rAma is telling sumantra is not 'ear did not hear'; He is not asking him to  
lie.  
  
'mAhArAja! Because rAma forced me, I did not listen to your word 'stop'. I  
kept driving the chariot on.  
  
This is what rAma is asking sumantra to say.  
  
Will rAma lie? This is the explanation for this.  
  
The chariot is gone now.
