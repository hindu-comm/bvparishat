The Brihadaranyakopanishad has this: 1.5.3:  
  

अन्यत्रमना अभूवं नादर्शं अन्यत्रमना अभूवं नाश्रौषं इति मनसा ह्येव पश्यति मनसा शृणोति ।

  

According to the narration posted by me:

  

rAma - 'Tell him you were *not able to hear what he was saying*. If he gets angry at you, just tell him you did not hear him.'  

  

The version I have heard in upanyasam before is: Rama tells Sumantara: If Dasaratha asks you why you did not stop despite his asking you to, tell him 'in the din created by all the people following the chariot, I could not hear you.'  

  

This is what appears natural to me. The other explanation 'I did not obey you' is very artificial, made with great efforts to save the 'satyavAk' nature of Rama.

  

नाश्रौषमिति राजानमुपालब्धोऽपि वक्ष्यसि \|  
चिरं दुःखस्य पापिष्ठमिति रामस्तमब्रवीत् \|\| ३४\|\|

  

Thus, people interpret variously.
