Dr. Trivediji,  

I do not think one can fit everything into one mould - revealed in a trance (what does trance mean here anyway - AveSa or samAdhi?) vs. revealed by meditative concentration vs. revealed in a dream vs. revealed by God or some other superhuman being.



Let alone the Veda and the scriptures of other religions, even scientific discoveries are often made outside of what is usually called the scientific method. The history of science is full of such instances, from Archimedes's Eureka moment to Kekule's dream about the molecular structure of benzene. There is no one-size-fits-all framework that can capture the extent of how different kinds of knowledge are accessed by human beings.



On a more general note, I feel it would be more productive if scientists who are interested in the Vedas and the Indian darshanas actually took the trouble to get a decent grounding in them, without preconceptions about what they should be. In the process, they can help thetraditional pandits get a similar exposure to contemporary science.



One could of coursejump to claim that our epics talk about nuclear warfare or that we had aircrafts in the distant past or that our ancestors were expert genetic engineers, but other than providing a temporary feel-good factor for some and a nice joke for others, what does this achieve?A thoughtful engagement with the issues of the present is highly necessary, and both scientists and Shastra pundits need to get involved. Or else, India will continue blindly aping whatever is decided in Europe and the USA without taking the Indian context into account. And people with traditional learning who could potentially contribute great things continue to get heavily disenfranchised in the process.



Rather than focusing on the jaded discourse of Sarasvati vs. Indus and intractable problems of script vs. symbols in the archaeological record and Aryans vs. Dravidians, bemoaning the legacy of colonialism and the occasional storm in a teacup with people like Michael Witzel, theintellectual efforts of science oriented peoplewould bemuch better spent on talking about problems that are going to hit the world within the next 50 years - water issues, energy issues, bioethics issues, extensive warfare using unmanned drones, the global economy, the role of religious strife inall this,etc. India has all these problems in ample measure today and there is much that a traditional SAstrika learning can bring to thinking about these kinds of issues.



What I see on this forum does not give me any great hope though. For Harihara's sake, people still relish arguments about the superiority of Vishnu vs. Siva and advaita vs. non-advaita varieties of vedAnta here. I thought the purpose of this forum wasquite different. What is the use of bhAratIya vidvat if the vidvAn-s of bhAratavarsha, whether SAstrika or scientific,don't want to bring their intellectual energies to bear upon things that should matter?



Regards,

Vidyasankar
