This seems to be considered as related point as there are two temples as far as I know named by श्रीरङ्ग -पट्टण in Mysore and another in श्रीरङ्गम् Tamilnad. Now all the five temple.

  

  

  

  

  

Temple Location

  

Sri Ranganatha Swamy Temple Srirangapatna

Sri Ranganatha Swamy Temple Srirangam

Parimala Ranganatha Perumal Temple Indalur, Mayiladuthurai  

  

along with other two Vaishnava Temples

  

Sarangapani Temple Kumbakonam  

Sri Appakkudathan Temple Trichy

  

are called Panca Ranga Kshetram according to one web source.

I am not sure whether in all these, the vimana is called "ranga" in all these temples. It may be also by the same name. Here is a video of the ranga vimana at Srirangam -

To these, we can add white ranga - as popular in the epithets

  

पाण्डुरङ्ग विट्टल, - the lord having white Ranga, in his temple?

  

Purandaradasa was familiar with the name रङ्गनायक in the kirtana, definitely describing Vishnu, along with Lakshmi, wakening him रङ्गनाथ.

  

ರಂಗನಾಯಕ ರಾಜೀವಲೋಚನ etc.  

  

I think it is not referring to Shiva and Paravati. Though popular as dancers, नटराज and चिन्नमस्ता are never referred to as रङ्गनाथ and रङ्गनायिका and one the reverse, रङ्गनायक/रङ्गनाथ are not seen described as dancers. Though as Krishna, he is described as dancer, as रङ्गनाथ he idly lying in the couch with रङ्गनायिका sitting at his feet waiting for his orders.

  

That is why I remarked



  

There are two

Though all the temples are having Ranga vimana, according to you, all the deities are not called श्रीरङ्ग nor all the places are called as श्रीरङ्ग or their deities are called नटराज which does not have a female counter part - रङ्गनायकि the corrupt forum and the temple in Srirangam. Nor रङ्गनायक called anywhere as नटराज.

as proposed in some post.

  

  

The question is pointed to why some temples are called Sriranga, though many explanations are possible by etymology. and not others.

  

The "ranga vimana" at Sriranga is said to have originated from Kshirasagara itself and hence the ranga vimana with Naryana Kshirasagarashayin is called there sriranga. That is what I got from the information spread through the web pages and as Mr. Pandurangi suggested.

  

Ranga itself is an epithet of Vishnu or Narayana, like Vitthala also listed among the epithets. The word will give rise to many meanings as in quoted portions from the रङ्गनाथ extracts in my post. and Prof.Korada has explained scholarly different meanings of Ranganatha, applicable to any deity, सगुण form. It can be either शिव or विष्णु or रङ्गनायिका - रङ्गा also. I think this is the idea of our V Subrahmanyan also, ardent follower of Advaita, in raising the question.

  

Thanks for the scholarly inputs by the members.
