In that case, you have a new query and could have started a new topic. **Was Ranganatha the family deity of Ikshvaku family?** There is no problem if the deviation and your explanation are within the limits of the title of the topic, which adds to the beauty of the discussion. Really the topic has taken the emphasis on the point you raised and it is really interesting by itself.

  

Thank you for raising the question and it is getting interesting replies. I too just pointed out the verse quoted by has nothing to do with the meaning of Ranganatha.
