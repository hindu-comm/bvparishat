Sir,  
  
I just made a check and found that the term 'Ranga mantapa' is a common one used to denote a stage/theater where performances are held. Many temples and other institutions too have a 'ranga mantapa'. Perhaps in the olden days even Palaces had such auditoriums.

I am again reminded of a नृत्सभा (apart from चित्सभा, कनकसभा ....) in the famous Chidambaram Temple.
