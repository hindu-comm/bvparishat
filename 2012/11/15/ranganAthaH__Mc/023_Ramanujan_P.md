Rama gifted His kuladhanam to his great devotee, Vibhishana, as he did not aspire for anything, but His loyal, devoted service.

Any other mundane gift would not have been accepted by or can equal this, desirable gift for Vibhishana.

अवधीर्य चतुर्विधं पुमर्थं भवदर्थे विनियुक्त-जीवितः सन् ।

लभते भवतः फलानि जन्तुः निखिलान्यत्र निदर्शनं जटायुः ।।

इति श्रीमद्वेदान्तदेशिकाः ।

Like Dhruva getting a status unasked for, by pure Vishnu-bhakti, the auspicious quality of कल्याण-गुणः अगणित-श्रेयः-पद-प्रापणम्

Is evident here.
