It is known that Ranganatha is watching the cosmic dance of Shiva  
Nataraaja at least in Chidambaram. The abode of reclining Vishnu  
known as Govindaraaja in Chidambaram is one of the canonical 108 holy  
places of Vishnu (Correction requested if I am wrong). I have visited  
the Shiva as well as the Vishnu temples at Chidambaram, that are in  
the same complex. A few years back the place was in news for all the  
wrong reasons. If interested you can read more about the above news  
at

About Chidambarm itself and the Ranganatha connection you can get some  
idea at
