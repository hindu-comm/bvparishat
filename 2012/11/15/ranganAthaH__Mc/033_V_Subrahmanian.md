Sir,  
  
I reported that purely to show that there was one more evidence, other than that provided by Dr.Ramanujan, to show that Vishnu was their deity. The additional reason was that the name 'Ranganatha' is not there in that text. My original post was to explore the possibility of the Ramayana mentioning the name 'Ranganatha' since the Raghu dynasty's deity is believed to be the one in Srirangam. Now it appears that that name is not there in the Ramayana.  
  
Kausalya not noticing Rama was not my point at all; it just formed part of the verse.  
  
regards
