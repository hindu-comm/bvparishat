In Tamil they use the term 'arangeTTRam' (அர‘ங்கேற்றம்) (kannada: rangapravesha ರಂಗಪ್ರವೇಶ to mean the maiden performance of a student of dance. This usage is also there in Tamil: நாடக அரங்கு (nATaka arangu) to mean a theater.  
  
Sir, from the various references that have so far been given, it appears that RanganAtha refers to the Lord of dance/theatrical performance. In that case does it mean 'naTarAjA'? Does this mean 'foremost among dancers' or 'king among actors' ? There does not seem to be this usage to refer to someone who is skilled in warfare/yuddha ranga.
