See also Parameswara Samhita (10:279-281) ) Vibhisanashed tears. The God then said to him, “This place is good, so also its kingand people. I desire to stay here. You may retire to Lanka”.

That this tradition in the Mahatmya was not of a late origin andpurely of local character can be gleaned from references to it in the ValmikiRamayana and the Padma and Matsya puranas. From the Valmiki Ramayanawe know that Rama advised Vibhisana, before he retired to Vaikunta, to ruleover his country with righteousness and to worship constantly the familydeity of the Iksvaku kings that had been presented to him.9(Uttarakanda,sarga 131, slokas 30, 31 and 91.) The object presented is mentioned askuladana or family property. That this kuladana was Sriranga Vimana isknown from the Padma Purana.10(Padma Purana, Uttara kanda, Ch.90(Sriranga varnana) ) The Matsya Purana mentions Srirangam as a place ofpilgrimage.11(Ch.22. v.44. (12) Canto X.L.156; XI.L.39.) In the present stage of things these references are more genuine that the ‘10 chapters’ ofthe Sriranga Mahatmya, said to be an episode in the Brahmanda Purana andthe ‘108 chapters’ version of the Garuda Purana.

  

  

Etymology

Srirangam is a compound of Sri and Rangam. In Sanskrit Rangam means

a stage; and Srirangam means ‘the holy stage’ or ‘the holy stage-like seatof God’. In Tamil arangam means an islet formed by two rivers, and it is bythis epithet that the shrine is generally referred to by the Vaisnava worksin Tamil. The Silappadikaram refers to it by this term and also by turutti,both meaning the same thing.12(Canto X.L.156; XI.L.39.)

Note that the Parameswara Samhita is a Pancaratra Agama text. 

I might have a copy at home that I can lookup and verify.

  

Can someone please check the above reference to the Padma Purana?

  

Thanks,
