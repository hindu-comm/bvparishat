Sir,  
  
There is a belief among srivaishnavas that the Ranganatha of Srirangam is brought from Ayodhya:

The deity was later given to King Ikshvaku to worship, and he brought the deity to his capital, Ayodhya. Eventually Lord Rama worshiped Sri Ranganatha. When Vibhishana, the brother of Ravana, came to Ayodhya, he requested permission to take Sri Ranganatha to his capital in Lanka to worship. He was allowed to do so on the condition that if he placed the deity on the ground, he would not be able to move the deity from that spot. Vibhishana agreed and proceeded to carry the deity south to Sri Lanka. On his way he placed the deity on the ground at Srirangam, on the bank of the Chandra Pushkarani tank. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | | [![three times bigger image in new window](https://ci5.googleusercontent.com/proxy/BGI6CKmrvXm-RrfLS6WWAl5teUl2gXXYs-c5-ExrrGpIXQ-ItDbAmbluUTT_NMJiXfTXbLCNILa4aQz38zFMW4XnOjOPjYApLbpmDRZIv7cbKw=s0-d-e1-ft#http://www.vaisnava.cz/fotky/srirangam/Gopuram-gold-vimana1.jpg)](http://www.vaisnava.cz/fotky/srirangam/Gopuram-gold-vimana1-v.jpg)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Since that time Sri Ranganatha has stayed at Srirangam. It is said that the deity faces south, instead of the traditional east, so as to face Vibhishana in Sri Lanka, to grace him and his kingdom. The sanctum (altar) faces south and the main entrance is also from the south (normally it is from the east). It is believed that Vibhishana goes to Srirangam every 12 years to worship the Lord. |

Later it was mentioned in this thread that the word 'kuladhanam' is what refers to Rangantha. So, there is a mix-up of the term Kuladhanam with the Ranganatha of srirangam. Dr. Ramanujan provided a verse from the pattabhisheka section to show that the vrata was connected to Vishnu. It is the tradition that all such important events in a family will center around the family deity worship.  I have also heard that Ranganatha was the family deity of the Ikshvaku-s. It is a combination of all these pieces of data that has resulted in this topic of this thread.
