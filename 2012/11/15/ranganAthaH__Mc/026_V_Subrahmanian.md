In the 'adhyAtmarAmAyaNam', the third sarga of the 'ayodhyAkAnDa' we have a short description of Kausalya engaged in worship soon after hearing about the announcement of Rama's proposed coronation as the 'yuva rAja':  
  
कौसल्याऽपि हरेः पूजां कुरुते रामकारणात् । ७८  
होमं च कारयामास ब्राह्मणेभ्यो ददौ धनम् ।  
ध्यायते विष्णुमेकाग्रमनसा मौनमास्थिता ॥ ७९  
अन्तःस्थमेकं घनचित्प्रकाशं  
निरस्तसर्वातिशयस्वरूपम् ।  
विष्णुं सदानन्दमयं हृदब्जे  
सा भावयन्ती न ददर्श रामम् ॥ ८०  
  
When she was in such a state Rama comes to her presence to take leave of her to the forest.  
  
I am not saying that from the above it can be concluded that the name Ranganatha is found in the adhyAtmarAmAyaNam. I am just reporting that Vishnu was the deity Kausalya prayed to at that time, according to this work.
