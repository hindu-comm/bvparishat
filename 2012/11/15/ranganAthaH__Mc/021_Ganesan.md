It would be useful to many of us to know how the "kuladhanam" occurring in this verse of Vaalmiiki RaamaayaNa is interpreted to be God Ranganatha.  
And, if the image was worshipped by the descendents of Raghu in which Rama was born, why VibhiishaNa should take it to Lanka ?  
Whose 'kuladhanam' was it ? Raghu's or VibhiishaNa's ?  
  
Ganesan
