The image makes clear he was gifted with a दिव्यविमान with मन्त्रोपदेश, and landed on the banks of Kaveri. and it was established in श्रीरङ्ग and clearly the chapter is devoted to श्रीरङ्गमाहात्म्य from the पारमहंस्यसंहिता belonging to पाञ्चरात्र.

  

Here there is no mention of कुलधन, and it may be the विमान i.e. पुष्पक belonging to कुबेर, from which it was seized by रावण along with लंका, and returned to him after Rama reached to Ayodhya after रावणवध. This seems to solve the problem of कुलधन under discussion. The लघुरामायण also seems to refer to this कुलधन of विभीषण, with reference to this episode of श्रीरङ्गमाहात्म्य.
