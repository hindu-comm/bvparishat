One more question that could be considered in determining whether it was the 'family deity' that was given away to VibhiShaNa is that whether the IkshvAku kula ended along with Rama. It is learned that Shatrughna ruled some parts and Lava and Kusha too ruled some parts of the Kingdom. If the vamsha continued it would be improper to conclude that Rama gave away the family deity.  
  
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dakshina_Kosala_Kingdom>  
//**Surya Vanshi [Ikshvaku dynasty](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikshvaku_dynasty "Ikshvaku dynasty")** kings ruled [Kosala](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosala "Kosala") with [Ayodhya](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayodhya "Ayodhya") as their capital. “Sri Ram Chandra” was a great king of that clan, based on whose character and activities, the great epic “Ramayana” was written. In this great epic, it is mentioned that after Sri [Rama](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rama "Rama"), the kingdom was divided among his two sons, [Lava](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lava "Lava") and [Kusha](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kusha_%28Ramayana%29 "Kusha (Ramayana)"). North [Kosala](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosala "Kosala") went to Lava as his share with “**Shravasti Nagari**”as his capital, and Kusha got south [Kosala](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosala "Kosala") as his share. He established his new capital, “**Kushasthalipura,**” on the river “Kushavratee” near the “[Vindhya](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vindhya "Vindhya")” mountain range, which divides north and south India. //
