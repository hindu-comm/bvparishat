Sir,  
I agree with you that one should not deviate. The topic was started by me and scholars did give many answers. At one stage I remembered the Ramayana connection with the Ranganatha deity of Srirangam and initiated an enquiry to locate the word/name in the Ramayana so that one could possibly trace the name to the oldest authored work. It is this that I meant by 'original post'. If that is a deviation from the topic, I shall stop posting on that.
