Namaste  
  
It is said that the Sri Ranganatha in Srirangam was originally worshiped by the 'Raghu' vamsha. It is possible that there is a mention of such a worship in the Valmiki Ramayana. Could anyone please show references?
In that case we would have traced the name 'RanganAtha' to that ancient text Ramayanam.
