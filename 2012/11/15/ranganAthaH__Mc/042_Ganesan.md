That is why I put the question " How can the word 'kuladhanam' be  
interpreted to mean God Ranganatha ?  
Does any of the commentaries on ValmiikiraamaayaNam interpret so ?  
Since VaalimiikiraamaayaNam is considered to be the earliest of all  
RaamaayaNa-s, it is but logical that one goes by it.

ramayana. kuladhana word is missing in it. neither could i find  
padmapurana  
uttarakhanda 90 mentioned by shreyas. it shows some other matter totally.
