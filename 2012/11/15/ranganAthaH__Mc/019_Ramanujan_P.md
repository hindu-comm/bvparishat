In the pattabhisheka sarga, it is mentioned that ’लब्ध्वा कुलधनं राजा लह्कां प्रायाद्विभीषणः’ .

This (kuladhanam) refers to Lord ranganatha, the presiding deity of Ikshvaku dynasty.

On the way, the Lord chose to remain between the two Kaveri-s at the present place, but is south-facing to oversee Lanka and bless Vibhishana.



In Hamsa sandesa, Sri Vedanta Desika mentions of there being (only) a sesha-pitha for Lord Ranganatha to arrive and take

Archanas at the present place.



स्थानं भाव्यं मुनिभिरुदितं श्रीमतो रङ्गधाम्नः ।।

सत्वे दिव्ये स्वयमुदयतः तस्य धाम्नः प्रसङ्गात्

मञ्जूषायां मरकतमिव भ्राजमानं तदन्तः ।

चेतो धावत्युपहितभुजं शेषभोगे शयानं

दीर्घापाङ्गं जलधितनयाजीवितं देवमाद्यम् ।।



It may be appreciated that while the episode of Sita being sent a message through a Raja-hamsa,

After knowing her stay at Asoka vana in lanka, through Anjaneya, the poet describes the route to the

Swan vis many divya-kshetras and not wanting to miss mention of Srirangam, creatively describes as above.

That is, while I talk of the future abode of our dynasty-deity, my mind runs towards Him at Ayodhya.
