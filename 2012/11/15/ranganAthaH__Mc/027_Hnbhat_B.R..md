So this has nothing to do with issue in question. Just reporting unwanted thing to the topic.

  

By the context itself it is clear the She worshiped Vishnu with homa, dhyana etc. for the coronation ceremony and meditated upon Vishnu in her mind lost herself so that she did not notice Rama, when he came.

  

Purely report of Valmiki, whether Vishnu was her deity or Ranganatha was her deity is left to the interpretation of the interested. Valmiki was reporting the reason why she didn't notice Rama engaged in auspicious ceremonies in connection with the coronation ceremonies, is crystal clear from the context.
