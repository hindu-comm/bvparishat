Anyhow, the testimony provided by Ramanujam is not found in the Ramayana, and the similar verse is found in लघुवाल्मीकीय as I had already given the authorship of which is not known where the term कुलधन appears, without इक्ष्वाकूणां in the post of Ramanujam.

  

The line found in लघुवाल्मीकीय in the पट्टाभिषेकसर्ग as mentioned by Ramanujam doesn't relate it with इक्ष्वाकु family at all and the वाल्मीकीयरामायण doesn't have the verse at all as pointed out by Prof.Pandurangi. I too checked the etext. In the Edition with Govindaraja's commentary, the same half-verse is found -

  

३७५. लब्ध्वा कुलधनं राजा लङ्कां प्रायाद्विभीषणः ॥ in लघुवाल्मीकीय,  

  

and in वाल्मीकिरामायण - as

  

\[रामेण सर्वकामैश्च यथार्हं प्रतिपूजितः।\]

लब्ध्वा कुलधनं राजा लङ्कां प्रायाद्विभीषणः ॥१३१.८८॥  

  

  

It is the commentary by Vaishnavaite scholars that makes the term श्रीरङविमान.

  

Govindaraja ---

  

कुलधनम् = इक्ष्वाकूणां कुलधनम्, श्रीरङ्गविमानमिति संप्रदायः।

  

२. रामानुज-

  

कुलधनम् - इक्ष्वाकुकुलधनम्, श्रीरङ्गसंज्ञकं विमानमिति सन्तो वदन्ति।

विभीषणक्रमागतं लङ्काराज्यमिति केचित्॥

  

But this commentator follows the explanation of गोविन्दराज, and refutes the other view, the deity of श्रीरङ्ग idol, belonging to इक्ष्वाकुकुल as explained in the web site given by you. and confirms रङ्गविमान.

  

३. सं  

  

इक्ष्वाकूणां कुलधनम् - इक्ष्वाकूणां कुलस्य धनरूपम् = श्रीरामम्, लब्ध्वा, सखीत्वेन लब्ध्वेति शेषः। and refutes the other view of गोविन्दराज, as the श्रीरङ्गविमान, as opposed to पद्मपुराण statement.

  

The opinion of the three commentators is not unanimously decided, but clings about the statement in पद्मपुराण,

  

प्रददौ तस्मै स्वविश्लेषासहिष्णवे।

श्रीरंगशायिनं स्वार्च्यमिक्ष्वाकुकुलदैवतम्।

रङ्गं विमानमादाय लङ्कां प्रायाद् विभीषणः॥

  

which gives rise to different interpretations. It is the रङ्ग विमान with श्रीरङ्ग in couching position, worshiped, the family deity of इक्ष्वाकु that he gave. (which again is not clear whether it is श्रीराम, the इक्ष्वाकुकुलदैवत, is the object donated or श्रीराम himself, the इक्ष्वाकुकुलदैवत, worshipped by विभीषण. I am attaching the relevant pages where you can find the detailed discussion.

  

Anyhow thanks for the discussion once again about श्रीरङ्ग and the विमान. On the whole, the पद्मपुराण section seems to make रङ्गनाथ identical with श्रीराम, who is कुलदैवत of इक्ष्वाकु-s, naturally honored and worshiped in the form of श्रीरङ्गनाथ, lying in the रङ्गविमान, that was gifted by श्रीराम to console विभीषण. This is the gist of the detailed explanation in the web page and the basis of difference of opinion among the commentators on वाल्मीकीयरामायण and the last commentator and the first commentator reconciling the two statements in Padmapurana and Ramayana as कुलदैवत and कुलधन relating to श्रीरङ्गविमान.

  

The opinions of Commentators can be viewed in the two pages attached.
