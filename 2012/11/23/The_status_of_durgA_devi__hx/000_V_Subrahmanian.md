In the following composition of Sri Purandaradasa we see that the consort of Vishnu (mAyAdevi) takes the form of 'bhUdevi', 'srIdevi' , 'durgAdevI' and 'lakshmi devi' and give company to the Lord without break.  
  
ಎಡಕೆ ಭೂಮಿ ಬಲಕೆ ಶ್ರೀಯು ಎದುರಲ್ಲಿ ದುರ್ಗಾದೇವಿ  
ತೊಡೆಯ ಮೇಲೆ ಲಕುಮಿಯಾಗಿ ಬಿಡದೆ ಮುದ್ದಾಡಿಸುವಂತೆ \|\|ಮರುಳು ಮಾಡಿಕೊಂಡೆಯಲ್ಲ\|\|  
  
While there is not any doubt about the others, the case of durgA devi causes some questions like:  
  
1. Is durgA the consort of Shiva  
  
2. Is durgA the sister of Vishnu (Bhaagavatam Kamsa episode)  
  
3. Is durgA the same as the one that Rukmini worshiped on the eve of her wedding  
  
4. Is durgA the same as the deity worshiped by the gopi-s as 'kAtyAyanI vRatam'  
  
5. Is durgA the one prayed for in the Vedic durgAsUktam  
  
6. There is a saying: कलौ दुर्गाविनायकौ meaning: in the kali yuga the worship of durgA and vinAyaka are most beneficial. Who is this durgA ?  
  
Scholars may please give their opinion on the above.
