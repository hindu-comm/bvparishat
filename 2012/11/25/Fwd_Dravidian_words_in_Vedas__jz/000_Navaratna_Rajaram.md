 Thank you!But I feel it is an anchronism to bring in words from texts that are demostratably later than the Vedic.



 **An appeal to scholars: Instead of Arya and Dravida I suggest that we use terms Gauda and Dravida**. These refer to geographically identifiable regions and there is never any confusion.



 One speaks of Panca Gauda and Panca Dravidas in refering for example to Brahmins, sometimes to other people also. No one speaks of Panca-Arya Brahmanas.



 Vaishyas of South India refer to themselves as Arya-Vaishyas. This is a cultural not geographical designation. Similarly, Eedigas (toddy makers) of Karnataka have passed a resolution to call themselves Arya Eedigas.



 Similarly Gauda Saravat Brahmins indicating their northern origin.



 Arya is a vague cultural term that has no regional connotation and has enormously been misapplied and misused. There is no authority for to be applied either to geography or language. Neither Panini nor Yaska describes language by Arya.



 **Lecture:** I am giving a talk on December 7 presenting new results. They suggest that prior to the emergence of PIE, long before that there was a language used in South Central India that I have called Proto Gauda Dravida. Neither PIE(s) nor PGD can be reconstructed from existing records, but their existence can be surmised.



 I will provide details in due course.
