Dear Sir,  
  
Your suggestion is too good and we have to be pertinently well rooted  
in our tradition. At this juncture, I would request the  
scholar-friends of .BVP to refer to a wonderful book of a very great  
scholar-poet, polymath and polyglot ( ingeniously well versed in  
linguistic, grammar, poetics, prosody, cultural studies and  
aesthetics) Late sEDiyaapu kRShNa bhaTTa by name tathya-dasarshana  
whose English translation (Discovery of Facts) is available.  
(published by the Rashtrakavi Govind Pai Samshodhana Kendra, Udupi,  
Karnataka). This throws much light on many of the issues connected  
with the problem of AIT and several peripheral issues. Krishna Bhatta  
was an original thinker of high merit who never used to accept  
anything which cannot be proved on the basis of strong facts and  
pertinent logic.It is so unfortunate that but for few people of honest  
scholarship, his works have remained unknown and side lined in the  
flood of "university wits".  
  
regards  
  
ganesh
