Subject: {भारतीयविद्वत्परिषत्} M.A Sanskrit v/s Vidwan Uttama  
  
Sir,

I have a doubt that among M.A (sanskrit) ang Vidwan (uttama) which one had more weightage.

 if,

1) Recently government declares Vidwan (uttam) equals to M.A . and also In M.A we study all shastras

   So M.A (sanskrit) is more weightage.



else

 2) M.A (sanskrit) - But In vidwan (uttama) we study particular shastra ex: vishishtadvaita or alnkar etc, unfortunatly we get award as VIDWAN

  

My question is why not we get " Vidwan " award for M.A sanskrit. ( vidvat=M.A)
