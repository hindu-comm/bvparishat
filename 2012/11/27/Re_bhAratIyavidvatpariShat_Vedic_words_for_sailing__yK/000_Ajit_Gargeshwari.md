Dear Haresh Gala,  
  
"Vedic words for sailing and flying are same or similar sounding ?" May be Root words / Root - are they same/similar ?  
  
I cannot understand this question? Are you asking in English? Please write in clear English or Sanskrit.  
  
"What words are available in Vedic Time for Sailing and flying ?"  
  
Do you need words used for "Time" and "To Sail" in the Vedas?  
  
Please use this link

The link has English to Sanskrit dictionary.  
  
Regards  
Ajit Gargeshwari
