I too could not understand the motive of the question. Does he wants to know the equivalent words for sailing or flying in Vedic Literature? And has he any clue to think that they are sounding the same in Vedic Literature?

  

In the first place, Vedic Vocabulary is compiled by यास्क with a running commentary in different contexts the words he has listed. One has to go through out the Vedic Lexicon before raising such a question and the question would be specific with reference to any word in the Veda-s with precise context. Otherwise, such an ambiguous flying question doesn't mean anything.

  

The other way go through the English translations and English-Sanskrit dictionaries to find Sanskrit words, (not specifically Vedic vocabulary) and find if there are meaning the same in Vedic literature.

  

If the purpose and the scope of the question is made clear, the answer may be framed suitably, if possible. If one asks whether there is a common sounding word for rocket or aeroplane in Rigveda, it is an awkward questin n the first place preconceiving rockets and aeroplanes were referred to in Vedic Literature.

  

Please specify the question and be specific with references to Vedic vocabulary and the meaning you got with source for framing the question.
