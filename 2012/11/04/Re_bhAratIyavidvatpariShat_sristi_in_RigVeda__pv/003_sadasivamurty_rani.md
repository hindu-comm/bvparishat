Dear Scholars,  
Pranams to all. The Theories of Creation is one of the most interesting subjects dealt with in the Vedas. In my observation there are more than 250 Suktas and Mantras dealing with this subject in all the four Vedas.
As it has been observed in these hymns the CREATION process according to the VEDIC seers underwent in five stages. 1. CHAOS to COSMOS 2. A SUPREME BEING as the CAUSE of THE UNIVERSE 3. The EMERGENCE of the UNIVERSE 4. The EVOLUTION of the UNIVERSE..and 5. The CONTINUOUS EXPANSION of the UNIVERSE. In a nutshell form these five parts are compared with the western cosmological theories also and presented in my attached research paper "VEDIC COSMOLOGICAL THEORIES". Pl. find the attachment. This was a result of my five years' study on this subject.  
With warm regards,  

**Dr. Rani Sadasiva Murty**
