Sir,

Your scholarly work on theories of creation is very enlightening. However the Sanskrit fonts do not show in your attachment sent with the mail.

I will be very grateful if this can be corrected.

While on this subject, I found that Rig Ved2.14 mentions about Global warming, holes in the ozone layer and natural catastrophes such as Tsunami very clearly.

This prompted me to find out if RigVed had any thing to say about the earlier phasebefore formation of ozone layer , when the solar raditions reaching the earth were so intense that no life was possible here. I was rewarded in my quest when I found that Rig Ved 1.32 deals with the subject of preozone layer formation period on earth.I wonder if any Vedic scolars have studied these topics also.
