आत्मा बुद्धौ धृतौ शीले यत्ने हृद्ब्रह्मणोर्मुनौ।(अजयः)।

अथ धृतौ बुद्धिस्वभाव-ब्रह्म-वर्ष्मसु।

यत्ने जीवेन्द्रिये वायौ चात्मा ... .... (राघवः)

(३.३.५७३) आत्मा यत्नो धृतिर्बुद्धिः स्वभावो ब्रह्म वर्ष्म च (अमरः)

  

All these contexts have different connotations as noted by the lexicographers and could be coherently accommodated compatible with the basic tenets of the respective schools and not independently assumed values by oneself.

Don't try to mix up the tenets of all the schools with your intelligence.

Each school defines its terminology by itself or borrows from the common school. Cross-breeding with other schools' terminology may not yield any increase of knowledge of neither the system. For Nyaya system,

  

आत्मेन्द्रियस्याधिष्ठाता करणं हि सकर्तृकम्।

  

The knowledge is a quality of आत्मन् according to Nyaya and Vaisheshika, acquired through the instrument करण mind. For वेदान्त school, Advaitin-s hold ज्ञान is the nature of आत्मन्, in reality ब्रह्म itself molded into जीवात्मा and परमात्मा, while द्वैत school holds the नैयायिक-s view keeping the difference between the two.

  

Now for your question you can refer to the commentaries on Bhagavadgita, available on the net with commentaries and translations belonging to different schools.
