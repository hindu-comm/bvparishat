We find severa references in our scriptures that  
the mind itself is Atman or Brahman. In context of Vedanta it is clear that every thing is reflection of the universal Self. In this sense even mind is brahman or both are identical. In West, since ancient period both mind and soul are identical. However after Descarts this theory was rejected but even today there are several thinkers they accept the both are identical. We find references in Upanisad that Pragnya is prana and prana is Pragnya. And also in Gita  

uddhared atmanatmanam

natmanam [avasadayet](http://vedabase.net/a/avasadayet)

atmaiva hy atmano bandhur

atmaiva ripur [atmanah](http://vedabase.net/a/atmanah)

How all these references taken under the study of Samkhya, Nyayaya, and Vedanta.

In Nyayaya-Vaisesika system both Mind and Atman are identical in the sense these are psychological phenomena.
