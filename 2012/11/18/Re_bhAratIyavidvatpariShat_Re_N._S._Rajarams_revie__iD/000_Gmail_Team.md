Dear Dr. N. Rajaram,



Thanks for writing review on the book of Dr. Elst.



I do not know which way was the flow of genes-from the subcontinent to the Central Asia or other way around. Certain nations described in the Epic Mahabharata were outside of the sub-continent. I wrote that information on bvpari long ago.



Talgeri claims that all tribes Anu, Druhu, Puru, were living originally in Punjab. Yadu and Turvasus south and east. Then Anu and Druhyu tribes moved to the west out of the subcontinent. But then who were in Afghanistan before that? These five tribes were children of Yayati from two wives of Asura origin. Where then Tr'itsu Bharatas came on the scene? Who were Tritsus?



In the book of O.P. Bharadvaja, many river names are simply Sararvati's name. He says RasA (I think Ranha) is also the name of Sarasvati, Iksumati is also the name of Sarasvati, Once the author decides that that he is going to promote Vedic Sarasvati, then all other tribes, holy places have to be fitted in the area around Indian Sarasvati. So all R's'is, Devas, Daityas, Raksasas, Vratyas, Bharatas, Panchalas, Asuras, have to fit in the land of Sarasvati and Dris'advati. Anybody who reads these books, can see how circus is done by authors to change distances, names, time periods.



For Vedic people Purus-Kurus, Krishnas people Vrisni, Andhakas were Vraatyas out of pure Kuru-Bharata fold centered on Vedic Sarasvati. In my opinion, although Talgeri, Bharadvaja offer wealth of information through their research,a lot of adjustments were done to support their positions.



I am not supporter of the AIT. My focus in on the Epic Mahabharata history. One can dismiss this Epic saying that there are many interpolations from time to time. For me history of Krishna is important. Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
