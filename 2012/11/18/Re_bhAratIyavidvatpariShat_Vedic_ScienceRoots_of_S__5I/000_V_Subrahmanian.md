Sir,  
  
I think the questions you have raised are quite pertinent though they have been raised before and deliberated upon. It is true that a consensus does not come about. It is because the problem is of that nature. No one is able to quite categorically say how and when when it comes to the Veda. All traditionalists 'believe' it is apaurusheya, unauthored, and it has been 'coming down' the ages. There is, however, this agreement among the sampradaya people: If we hold the Veda to be apaurusheya with whatever knowledge we have about it, it is sufficient to cater to our needs of puruShArtha sAdhana. We accord only that much status to it and no more.  
  
Like any other question, the question about the Veda too does not brook serious enquiry. Scholars, when we ask them about those 'uncomfortable' questions about the Veda only say: If we try to give one answer, there is a problem in another area.  
  
In any case, it would be futile to attempt to give 'rational' answers to the question about Veda to the modern mind. It would ultimately dawn on us that 'let us too follow the way of our elders, achieve the puruShArtha, and be done with all questions'. Since all questions cannot be solved; they are best allowed to be dissolved in the wisdom of Self-knowledge.
