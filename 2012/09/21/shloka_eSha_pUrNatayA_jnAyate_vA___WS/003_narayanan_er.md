Dear Shri Shrivathsa,

I also tried the source of this verse by searching in internet after Dr. Vishnu has posted it. But the source was not available. I understood that Vishnu's father himself was a prolific Sanskrit scholar like his son. It could have been his own composition. The people who practice the Aksharashloka recite many such verses without bothering the source. The version which I heard from a monthly Vedic magazine called Anaadi during early 1980s which ultimately stopped its publications towards the middle of that decade. There were many a number of articles published on the Vedic ritualistic practices by prolific scholars in Malayalam medium. Anaadi magazine was so popular among brahmins especially in South Malabar and Cochin. Regarding the source of the verse, Dr. Vishnu can only confirm whether his father's own composition. The chances could be well there.

Regards,

Narayanan
