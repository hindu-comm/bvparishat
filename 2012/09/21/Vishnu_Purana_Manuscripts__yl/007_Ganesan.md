"Does anyone have any contacts of some traditional Vishnu Purana scholars? I feel in south India there will be many."  
  

To find such a scholar nowadays may be almost impossible.  
For, nowadays mostly we hear of scholars, pravacanakaara-s, etc. active only in the Vaishnava Bhagavatapuranam. Even many of the Sanskrit scholars and modern researchers scarcely refer, mention or study or even be familiar with some of the other ancient Mahapurana-s.
