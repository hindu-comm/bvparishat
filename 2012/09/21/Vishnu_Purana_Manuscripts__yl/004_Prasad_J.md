Thank you all for your replies. I am really sorry for so late reply.  
  
Dear Mr. Dash, from where you got this data? This is so useful.  
I was searching on internet for these publications, however it is difficult to find some of these. Ex. Vangavasi Press, Calcutta; Jananasuryodaya Press, madras; N. S. Press, Bombay; Sundappalayam, Coimbatore; Kumbhakonam, Bombay.  
Do you also know how to search for these publications and how to get the books from them?

  
  
Thank you.  
  
Regards,  
Prasad J
