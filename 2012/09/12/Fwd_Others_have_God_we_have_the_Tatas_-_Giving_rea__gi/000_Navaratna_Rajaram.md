 Swami Vivekananda said: "Jana-seva is janardana-seva." (Service to humanity is service to God.) Only Tatas (and others like the Satya Sai, Anandamayi Ma, etc) are practicing it. And all without fuss or public posturing.



 Our Hindu organizations shouldrecognize this is where realspiritualitylies, not in reviving obscurantist rituals.



 (Incidentally, whatare the 'Crown Prince' and his 'dynasty' doing in this-- other than running scared and making excuses for jihadis by blaming the victims?)
