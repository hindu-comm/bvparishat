Thank you Sir for the intimation. I shall surely attend the show. I have intimated other Sanskrit enthusiasts among my friends too about this. Could you kindly request the organizers to videograph the show so that 1. It could be made available as DVDs for a price and or 2.When uploaded in YouTube many who could not attend the presentation can view it?  
  
Warm regards,
