I attended the drama yesterday and was simply overwhelmed by the wonderful performance of the vidyarthis of the PPVP. The dialogues were well written and rendered too. The costumes were a real treat to the eye. Draupadi and Bhima stood out in their performance. I wish the play is staged many more times during the days to come. At this venue the sound output was somewhat poor.  
  
I wholeheartedly congratulate the entire team including the author of the play, the directors and the music support party. The show ended somewhere close to 12 pm. It would be an even greater crowd puller if the timing is a little more audience-friendly.
