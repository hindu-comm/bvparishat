Tarka Sastra is a science of dialectics, logic and reasoning, and art of debate that analyzes the nature and source of knowledge and its validity. Tarka means debate or an argument.  
  
Tarka sastra has concepts called "poorva paksha" and "uttara paksha". When one raises a point (poorva paksha) the other one criticizes it (uttara paksha). Then the debate starts. Each one tries to support his point of view by getting various references. The meaning of the word tarka also is specific, in that it does not imply a pure logical analysis but a complex activity of discourse guided by strict definitions and goals so as to have. This concept is referred in Bhagawad Gita as "vAdaH pravadatAmasmi". This knowledge of Tarka is essential to understand vedanta and advaita.
