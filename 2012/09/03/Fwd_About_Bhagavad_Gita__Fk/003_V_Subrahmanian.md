It could be a 'bhAvArtha' of the following Bh.Gita verse:  
  
न प्रहृष्येत् प्रियं प्राप्य नोद्विजेत् प्राप्य चाप्रियम् ।  
स्थिरबुद्धिरसम्मूढो ब्रह्मविद् ब्रह्मणि स्थितः \|\| 5.20  
  
There are other verses of this genre in the Gita. It could be the message that 'one should have a positive attitude to whatever happens in life' that is being conveyed by the lines quoted in English.
