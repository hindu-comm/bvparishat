Dear Sirs,

I have seen this and such other statements printed in Kannada and  
framed and hung at many public and private places. These 'good' but  
worth for nothing statements go by the name "This is the essence of  
bhagavadgitaa"!!! Even Prof. K.S. Kannan had once his opinion this  
with me. None of these statements find any striking parallel with the  
gitaa and any effort to read relevance in such statements in the light  
of gitaa can only a ghuNaakShara-nyaaya:-)...Any how even scholars  
like you are forced to find the roots of these statements in the holy  
text:-) Here I am tempted to quote sundarapaaNDya's  
neetidiviShaShTikaa:

uccairapi vaktavyaM yat kiMcit ajaanataa'pi puruShENa.  
mUDhaa bahumanyantE viduShaamapi saMSayO bhavati.

Sorry if am taking too much liberty with you...snnEhaH kila maaM  
mukharayaati na purObhaagitaa!!!
