Sir,  
  
A Bhagavadgita message Chart has been printed and circulated several yeas ago in all languages by the Maataa AmRtAnandamayI institution, Kerala. In this, one message is the one cited by Shri Dipak. Even I have wondered as to which are the verses that correspond to this message from the Bhagavadgita.
