but the precise English preposition for this तृतीया sense is elusive to me,

'Thou art with that atman' could be the other sense of the compound.

I think Sri Vidyashankar was only stating the obvious: that rebuttals of the advaita interpretation are not confined to grammar. But Sri Nityananda clearly sought only a grammatical explanation, as he made clear from the first post.

The upanishad starts with 'Ishavasyam idam sarvam...' and ends with '...Yat te roopam kalyanatamam...' and 'poornam eva'vashishyate,' particularly with repeated segments in the middle saying '...amrutam asnute...' To a mind that is not befuddled by polemics or grammar, there is ample indication that paramatAtparya of the first mantra is not merely tyaaga but bhagavatpraapti. As Bhagavad Ramanuja puts it, 'bhagavad-anubhava-janita-anavadhika-atishayapreetikaarita-asheshaavasthochita-asheshasheshataikaratiroopa-nitya kainkaryam'.

Polemics were resorted to in an attempt to defend the Advaita position. Fair enough. But the very fact that polemical diatribe can lead to divergent understanding should drive the point of grammar's importance in the final import.
