dear shri Mishra, and Aditya,

I dont think there is any point going far in this point. I hope this is concluded here.

we should limit ourselves to some point. in no way we should create problems to many other scholars present in this forum. as said ofter there are always apparent faults with everybody including great scholars. दोषो ह्यविद्यमानोपि तच्चित्तानां प्रकाशते। किमुत विद्यमानः

  

since it is the first time in the last thousand years we are sitting here altogether on one forum. I hope we all understand that thing and dont want to disturb others. one can criticise advaita or dvaita on other forums like advaita list or other and their blogs etc. अति सर्वत्र वर्जयेत्

please close the matter.
