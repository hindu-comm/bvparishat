2012/9/3 Nityanand Misra \<[nmi...@gmail.com]()\> says:

"Again, let's keep the discussion limited to grammar only."

Yet, just before this he quoted two sentences:

a\) "...In the Hindi commentary he cites 1.3.66 and says "व्याकरण के  
अनुसार भी श्रीशङ्कराचार्यकृत भुञ्जीथाः की पालयेथाः व्याख्या अशुद्ध है"

  
(The explanation of Śrīśaṅkarācārya is incorrect even according to  
grammar)."

b\) "...He further says "यत्तु भुञ्जीथाः इत्यस्य पालयेथाः इत्यर्थो

  
व्याख्यायते तदशास्त्रीयम्".

Both the interpretations later quoted would have stood by themselves,  
without these additional remarks. Such remarks naturally will trigger  
counter-remarks. And, yet, the last sentence urges that discussion be  
limited to grammar only, thereby acknowledging the stated policy of  
BVP not to encourage such polemics.

All this, not on something which would make a serious difference to  
doctrine, but on a statement which is fundamentally acceptable not  
only to all Vedantins, but all people - Hindus, Buddhists, Christians  
etc., may be excepting the Caarvaakas.

Clearly, for whatever reason, there is a sustained effort to denigrate  
a particular acharya. It is sad that BVP is being so subverted.
