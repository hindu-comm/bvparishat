Dear Misraji,



High caliber scholars of vyAkaraNa who are on this list are keeping quiet on the Paninian or otherwise nature of the interpretations in question, so it does seem to me (also) that the atmosphere sought to be created in this thread is not necessarily congenial to a free discussion.



In any case, may I mentiona fewsalient points?



Firstly, as a general observation, the said verse is Sruti, so that its wordsare not strictly bound by rules created by Panini and the vyAkaraNa beginning with ashTAdhyAyI. An interpreter of Sruti need not make his source text adhere strictlyto rules of Paninian grammar, so long asthe overall meaning provided in his commentary is self-consistent and conveys a larger meaningful picture. This one exception trumps all the tomes of grammar that anyone can cite in this regard. As such, Paninian grammar would be the weakest basis to applaud or criticize a commentator's understanding of a Sruti text.



Secondly, for anyone who understands well the central value of nivRtti dharma and saMnyAsa in the vedAnta tradition, taking the root bhuj in the sense of abhyavahAra is quite at odds with the message of "tena tyaktena," "mA gRdhaH" and "kasya svid dhanam?" in the same verse.One could surely write a lotalong these lines, but as that will not necessarily be about vyAkaraNa, I will skip that for now. Suffice it to say that resorting to another well attested meaning of the same root is well within reason, especially given the Sruti exception already cited above and taking into account that in practical usage, there is a lot of flexibility in usage of parasmaipada and Atmanepada verb terminations, notwithstanding the strict rules of vyAkaraNa. Creation(of words) precedes (their) analysis, to paraphrase patanjali.



Thirdly, with all due respect to Sri Dayanand Saraswati of the Arya Samaj (or is the Hindi citation from the pen of Shri Rajveer Shastri?) and Sri Ramabhadracharya, much as you would like to project their comments as being only about vyAkaraNa, the conclusions they make and the words they choose to use (aSuddha and aSAstrIya) are less about the grammar andmore about the content of Sankara's interpretation. There is, self-confessedly, a gooddeal ofpolemics involved in their interpretation, citing grammar almost as an afterthought, and only as an additional scoring point in their criticism of the SAnkara bhAshya. For example, the grammar comment in the Hindi text from the Arya Samaji camp comesafter seven and a half pages ofcriticizing Sankara in a discussionthat is not about grammar.



This is indeed par for the course in debates amongst different vedAnta schools. By the same token, however, the words of the authors whom you cite are also subject to a similar kind of polemical countering by those who think Sankara's interpretation isbetter or by those who may have their own interpretation to offer. And needless to say, in the best SAstrArthatraditions of critically examining vipaksha-s, such countering need not confine itself strictly to grammar. After all, for the authors whom you cite, grammar rules areone of the smallest tools in their kit, not the only one nor even the main tool in their understanding or misunderstanding of advaita vedAnta. By trying to cast this as purely an exercise in grammatical analysis and nothing more,you are indeed stacking the deck, so to speak.



Best regards,

Vidyasankar



ps. I should have thought that Sruti not being constrained by Paninian grammar would be more than obvious to those who wish to supply a host of prepositions and make the word tat directly yield meanings of tasmai / tasmAt / tasya / tasminn.As an aside, I wonder why tena is left out. And I don't mean this postscript to be personally about you. Although it is occasioned by your digital signature, Iintend it in a general sense.
