Dear Dr. Ganesh  
  
Here are the references - Tulsidas has referred to the Ram Janmabhoomi/destruction of temple/mosque at three places:  
  
***1. Eight दोहाs from तुलसी दोहा शतक  
***These Dohas in Awadhi directly describe the demolition of the temple and the construction of the mosque at the same place. They are verse numbers 85 to 92 of the Tulasi Doha Shataka. This is a less-known work of Tulsidas which according to its Phalashruti, was composed in Vikrama 1647 (1590 AD), during the reign of Akbar. The language of the work is very similar to that of the Ramcharitmanas. The Tulasi Doha Shataka was published by Rai Bahadur Babu Singh, the Taluqedar of Raebareli, United Provinces, in 1944. It was printed at the Rama Jantralaya Press.  
The book has been out of print for many years, and most likely only one edition came out. Some copies of the book are available. As per the statement made by Jagadguru Rāmabhadrācārya in the Allahabad High Court during during cross-examination by Zafaryab Jilani, one copy of the book is present at the Shandikhurd village of Jaunpur district, at his Pūrvāśrama home.

***2. One कवित्त from कवितावली  
***This कवित्त in Braja bhasha is from the work Kavitavali which is widely accepted as the composition of Tulsidas. The work was composed sometime between 1608 and 1614 AD during the reign of Jahangir. The stanza is verse number 106 in the Uttarakanda as per the Gita Press edition of the Kavitavali (published 1996). In this work Tulsidas mentions that he does not care for the world. In the last line he says माँग के खैबो मसीत में सोइबो, means "I will ask \[for भिक्षा\] to eat, and will sleep in the mosque". The stanza is famous and sung by many classical singers - my own paternal grandmother used to sing it to me and my cousins in the 1980s and early 1990s.  
It is indeed quite odd that a Vaishnava Virakta acclaimed in his lifetime as a saint and incarnation of Valmiki after composing the Ramcharitmanas during 1574-1576, would sleep in a "mosque", where the entry of non-Muslims is prohibited. As per Svāmī Rāmabhadrācārya's interpretation, the "mosque" referred to here was the disputed structure. Assuming this is true, Hindus must have taken control of a portion of the disputed structure and prayed there by 1608-1614 AD itself. I would like to remind that as per the French account of Father Joseph Tieffenthaler, Hindus worshipped and celebrated Ramanavami at the disputed structure in 1767 AD.

***3. One चौपाई from रामचरितमानस***  
  
There is one chaupai in the Ramcharitmanas which uses the word जन्मभूमि. The context is that श्रीराम is aboard the पुष्पकविमान with the वानरs. As the विमान is over अयोध्या, he says to the वानरs -  
जन्मभूमि मम पुरी सुहावनि। उत्तर दिसि बह सरजू पावनि॥ RCM 7-4-5 ॥  
Here the usage is what is known as लुप्तसप्तमी in Awadhi grammar which is seen at many places in Tulsidas' works. The intent of Tulsidas is not that this "पुरी (whole city) is the जन्मभूमि" but rather "the जन्मभूमि is in this पुरी". Here is the commentary by Svāmī Rāmabhadrācārya - "इसी सुहावनी श्रीअयोध्यापुरी में मेरी जन्मभूमि है, जिसके उत्तर दिशा में (तीन सौ धनुष की दूरी पर) पवित्र श्रीसरयू नदी बहती है. \[In this beautiful Ayodhya city is my Janmabhoomi, to the north of which (at a distance of three hundred "bow-measures") flows the sacred Sarayu river\].
