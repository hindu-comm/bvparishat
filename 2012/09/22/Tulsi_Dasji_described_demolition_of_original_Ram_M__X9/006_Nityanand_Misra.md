Dear Dr. Ganesh  
  
Below are the verses along with the English translations by the court (labelled as AHC), and me (labelled as NM). As I mentioned the court translations are not very accurate but get the gist or essence of the Dohas. I have tried my best to provide an accurate translation with my limited knowledge of Awadhi.  
  
Thanks, Nityanand  
  

मंत्र उपनिषद ब्राह्मनहुँ बहु पुरान इतिहास ।

जवन जराये रोष भरि करि तुलसी परिहास ॥ 85 ॥

AHC: Goswami Tulsidas Ji says that 'Yavans' (barbarians /Mohammedans) ridicule hymns, several Upnishads and treatises like Brahmans, Puranas, Itihas (histories) etc. and also the Hindu society (orthodox religion) having faith in them. They exploit the Hindu society in different ways.

NM: Tulasīdāsa says that the *Yavana*s, filled with rage, burnt many Mantras or Saṃhitās, Upaniṣads and even Brāhamaṇas (parts of Vedas), and Purāṇa and Itihāsa scriptures, after ridiculing them.



सिखा सूत्र ते हीन करि बल ते हिन्दू लोग ।

भमरि भगाये देश ते तुलसी कठिन कुजोग ॥ 86 ॥

AHC: Goswami Tulsi Das says that forcible attempts are being made by Muslims to expel the followers of Hinduism from their own native place (country), forcibly divesting them of their Shikha (lock of hair on the crown of head) and 'Yagyopaveet' (sacrificial thread) and causing them to deviate from their religion. Tulsi Das terms this time as a hard and harrowing one.

NM: Tulasīdāsa says that in the hard and inappropriate age, \[they, the *Yavanas*\] forcibly made the Hindus bereft of Śikhā (the hair tuft) and Sūtra (the sacred thread) and made them wander \[as homeless people\], after which they expelled them from their country (native place).



बाबर बर्बर आइके कर लीन्हे करवाल ।

हने पचारि पचारि जन तुलसी काल कराल ॥ 87 ॥

AHC: Describing the barbaric attack of Babur, Goswami Ji says that he indulged in gruesome genocide of the natives of that place (followers of Hinduism), using sword (army).

NM: The barbaric Babar came, with a sword in his hand, and killed people after repeatedly calling out to them. Tulasīdāsa says that the time was terrible.



संवत सर वसु बान नभ ग्रीष्म ऋतु अनुमानि ।

तुलसी अवधहिं जड़ जवन अनरथ किय अनखानि ॥ 88 ॥

AHC: Gowami Tulsi Das Ji says that countless atrocities were committed by foolish ‘Yavans’ (Mohammedans) in Awadh (Ayodhya) in and around the summer of Samvat 1585, that is, 1528 AD (Samvat 1585- 57=1528 AD).

NM: Tulasīdāsa says that in the Saṃvat 1585 (1528 AD), sometime around the summer season, the ignorant *Yavana*s caused disaster and sorrow in Awadh (Ayodhyā).



राम जनम महिं मंदिरहिं तोरि मसीत बनाय ।

जवहिं बहुत हिन्दुन हते तुलसी कीन्ही हाय ॥ 89 ॥

AHC: Describing the attack made by 'Yavans', that is, Mohammedans on Sri Ramjanambhumi temple, Tulsi Das Ji says that after a number of Hindus had been mercilessly killed, Sri Ram Janam Bhumi temple was broken to make it a mosque. Looking at the ruthless killing of Hindus, Tulsi Ji says that his heart felt aggrieved, that is, it began to weep, and on account of incident it continues to writhe in pain.

NM: Destroying the temple at Rāmajanmabhūmi, they constructed a mosque. When they killed many Hindus, Tulasīdāsa cried out - Alas!



दल्यो मीरबाकी अवध मन्दिर रामसमाज ।

तुलसी रोवत हृदय हति त्राहि त्राहि रघुराज ॥ 90 ॥

AHC: Seeing the mosque constructed by Mir Baqi in Awadh, that is, Ayodhya in the wake of demolition of SriRam Janam Bhumi temple preceded by the grisly killing of followers of Hinduism having faith in Rama and also seeing the bad plight of the temple of his favoured deity Rama, the heart of Tulsi began to always cry tearfully for Raghuraj (the most revered among the scions of the Raghu Dynasty). Being aggrieved thereby, submitting himself to the will of Sri Rama, he shouted: O Ram ! Save....Save...

NM: Mir Baqi destroyed the temple in Awadh (Ayodhyā) and the *Rāmasamāja* (the idols Rāma Pañcāyatana – Rāma, Sītā, Bharata, Lakṣmaṇa, Śatrughna, Hanumān). \[On thinking of this,\] Tulasīdāsa cries, beating his chest, O the best of Raghus! Protect us, protect us!



राम जनम मंदिर जहाँ लसत अवध के बीच ।

तुलसी रची मसीत तहँ मीरबाँकि खल नीच ॥ 91 ॥

AHC: Tulsi Das Ji says that the mosque was constructed by the wicked Mir Baqi after demolishing Sri Ram Janam Bhumi temple, situated in the middle of Awadh, that is, Ayodhya.

NM: Tulasīdāsa says that in the midst of Awadh (Ayodhyā), where the Rāmajanmabhūmi temple was resplendent, there the wicked and vile Mir Baqi constructed a mosque.



रामायन घरि घन्ट जहँ श्रुति पुरान उपखान ।

तुलसी जवन अजान तहँ कियो कुरान अजान ॥ 92 ॥

AHC: Tulsi Das Ji says that the Quran as well as Ajaan call is heard from the holy place of Sri Ram Janam Bhumi, where discourses from Shrutis, Vedas, Puranas, Upnishads etc. used to be always heard and which used to be constantly reverberated with sweet sound of bells.

NM: Tulasīdāsa says that where there was constant ringing of the bells and the narrations (*upakhāna*, from Saṃskṛta *upākhyāna*) of the Rāmāyaṇa, Veda and Purāṇa, the ignorant (*ajāna*) Yavana read (literally, “did”) the Quran and the Azaan (*ajāna*). (Yamaka figure of speech in the repetition of *ajāna*.)
