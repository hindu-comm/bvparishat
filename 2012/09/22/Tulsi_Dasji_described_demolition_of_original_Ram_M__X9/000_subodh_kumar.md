Respected scholars,

It is said that demolition of Ram Mandir in 1528 to build the Babari
structure took place when Tulsi Das ji was around. It is argued by the Babri mosque representatives that since no account of the act wasleft
by Tulsi Das ji of the destruction of original Ram Mandir, there was no Ram Mandir there in the first place. 

The following deposition before Allahabad High Court in 2003 by Jagadguru Rambhadracharya lays this fallacy to rest. It also appears to becollusion of our entire media that these verses of Tulsi Das ji have never been brought out to see the day light.

I wonder if these verses can be traced and quoted by some expert for enlightenment of general public.



  
Deposition on behalf of Lord Rāma in Ayodhyā case

In the year 2003, Jagadguru Rāmabhadrācārya deposed as an expert witness for religious matters in the Allahabad High Court. As the infant Rāma is a minor, Jagadguru Rāmabhadrācārya, being a descendant of sage Vaśiṣṭha and thus a Brāhmaṇa from the Gurukula of Lord Rāma, defended the Lord in the case. Portions of his affidavit and cross-examination are quoted in the final judgement by the High Court. In his affidavit, he cited the ancient Hindu scriptures (Vālmīki's Rāmāyaṇa, Rāmatāpanīya Upaniṣad, Skanda Purāṇa, Yajurveda, Atharvaveda, et cetera) describing Ayodhyā as a city holy to Hindus and the birthplace of Rāma. He cited verses from two works of Tulasīdāsa - eight verses from the Dohā Śataka which describe the destruction of a temple and construction of mosque at the disputed site in 1528 CE, and one verse from Kavitāvalī which mentions the disputed site. Refuting the theory of the original temple being to the North of the disputed area (as pleaded by the pro-mosque parties), he described the boundaries of the Janmabhūmi as mentioned in the Ayodhyā Māhātmya section of Skanda Purāṇa, which tallied with the present location of disputed area as noted by Justice Sudhir Agarwal. The verdict on September 30, 2010, ruled in the favour of Lord Rāma – the prayers of crores of Hindus were answered, and Jagadguru Rāmabhadrācārya’s testimony was vindicated.
