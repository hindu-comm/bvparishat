Dear Pravesh,

  

Hari Om!

  

The idea about this camp and the organising work of the same is done by Chinmaya International Foundation (the research wing of Chinmaya Mission). I am just helping with the co-ordination and organising the event.

  

As you rightly said, these type of works are needed these days. There is a huge gap between our traditional knowledge and present day education. Chinmaya International Foundation (CIF) is into all such activities that can bridge such gaps between the Pundit and the Public.

  

We have kept this camp mainly for Maths teachers just to show how Ancient Indian Mathematics is still applicable in today's academics and how it can make Mathematics more interesting.

  

Regards,
