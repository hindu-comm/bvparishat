Dear Sir,

The opportunities will be as usual as in any other universities, but the evaluation of the importance of Sanskrit and Pali will be calculated by the concerned authorities. We can only hope that Sanskritists will be entertained. The theories of nobility, purity, honesty, morality, ethics, compassion, sympathy, empathy and social welfare could be taught through the translations too. In that case where do Pali and Sanskrit go in that University? Most of the available Vaipulyasutras are being translated into English under the scheme of the Sacred Books of the East. If the University come up with Sanskrit and Pali media of study, it will be good.

Regards,

Narayanan
