Dear Dr. Kulakarni,

As far as my very little knowledge goes, the literature of both the Jainism and the Buddhism were increasingly being dominated with Sanskrit language. If we consider the Buddhism; the Vaipulyasutras of the Mahayana (the great vehicle) tradition had been composed in Sanskrit (most of them grammatically and idiomatically not that sound; whereas Aryasura's Jatakamala and the Siksasamuccaya of Santideva etc. are the exception-they write good Sanskrit). But the Pali tradition was popular outside India, called the "Theravada" (may be matching with Sthiravada) was mocked by the former as "Hinayana" (an inferior vehicle). The latter school had become popular in Srilanka and in quite a few places in South-East Asia. The Bhikkhus (monks) came up with Abhidhamma, Suttapitaka, Vinayapitaka, Attakatha, Dhammapada etc. in Pali.

  

The Tattvārthasūtra of Umāsvāti, Mahāpurāṇa of Ācārya Jinasena, Sanmatitarka of Siddhasena, Abhisamayalankara of Haribhadra, Prabandhacintamani of Merutunga are all Sanskrit works by the Jainastoo, there may be hundreds of Sanskrit works like that. The Prabandhacintamani contains the Jain-Prakrit verses as well.

  

Moreover, regarding Sanchi, Madhyapradesh, is having the Buddhist monuments preserved, as the Govt. of Srilanka financially collaborating with the Archeological Department of India for the maintenance of the idols of the Bodhisattvas, Tathagatas, Pudgalas or whatever whatever. Anyway, neither Pali, nor Prakrit are not at all harmful to Sanskrit. You may see these Anekabuddhapratibodhitas, Bodhisattvas, Manjusris, Tathagatas, Pudgalas etc. in the Sanskrit Mahayana literary tradition. But one can hardly assume what Mahinda Rajapaksa is thinking over it!!!

  

Regards,

Narayanan
