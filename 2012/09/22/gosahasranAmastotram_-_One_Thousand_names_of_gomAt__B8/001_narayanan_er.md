Dear Sh. Nityanand Misra,

Thank you very much for the soft copy of the Gosahasranāmastotram. I have already saved it for reading. Interestingly, a Twenty-first Century work in Sanskrit is perfectly matching with the works like the Viṣṇusahasranāman, Lalitāsahasranāman, Lalitākavaca, Devīmāhātmya, Gāyatrīsahasranāman of the Rudrayāmala etc. The interpretation of the text indicates the way of propagation of the tāntric tradition of worship, and here it is the mother-cow!!! Much more above the salute to H.H. Jagadguru Rāmabhadrācārya for his dedication to Sanskrit language and culture. Thank you very much again, Sir.

Regards,

Narayanan
