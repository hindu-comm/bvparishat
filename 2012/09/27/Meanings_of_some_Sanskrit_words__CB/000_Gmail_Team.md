Respected scholars, Namaskar!



I have problem with few Sanskrit words. Please help.



I am still confused on these words

What is difference between आरंभ and प्रारंभ ?

What is the difference between आमंत्रण and निमंत्रण?

Apte's dictionary of not much help.

---------------------------------



Rigveda (10/14/16 and 6/47/3) has word षळुर्वी.



What is its meaning ? Is it षट्+उर्वी



Similarly we have in Mantra pus'panjali एकराळिति



What is its meaning? Is it एकराट्+इति



In Rgveda ईडे becomes ईळेand मीढुषे becomes मीळ्हुषे



What is the meaning of मीढुषे?



Why retroflex sounds are changed into ळ् and ळ्ह्?



Panini did not refer to them I think.







Please help. Thanks. N.R.Joshi
