When Lord Krushna approaches BhEshma along with Yudhistira and others, the doyen is moved by the Lord's divine presence and breaks forth into a eulogy of the Lord, which is celebrated as a prayer for liberation.He recaptures Krushna's instruction to Arjuna that imparts the highest knowledge to transcend worldly ties.  
Reading, chanting,reciting and listening BhEshma stuti bestows Peace and Bliss.
