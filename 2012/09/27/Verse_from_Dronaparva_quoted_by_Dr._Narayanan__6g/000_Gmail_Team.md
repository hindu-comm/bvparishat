Dear Dr.E.R.Narayanan,and other respected scholars, Namaskar!



Your posting of Mahabharata Sloka Dronaparva made me uneasy.



Reason---- To the best of my knowledge in the known history (after 500 BC) the tribe of Yu Chi from very northeast of Afghanistan pushed Shakas down. Shakas then entered northwest Afghanistan which was satrapy (Harahati) of Persian Empire, Persian settled Shakas in Iranian land. That land came to be known as Shakasthana and later on Sigisthan. Shakas, Kambojas Vahlikas (Bactrians) were fighting Alexander before his reaching to Peshawar area.



So this Sloka from Mahabharata shows two things-Either part of Mahabharat was composed after the above history of the knownera or the ancient Mahabharata knew certain lands beyond the western border of the subcontinent.



Rigveda has river names from Afghanistan -Kubha, Krumu, Gomal and name of Abhyavartin Cayamana called PARTHAV. This is disturbing too. On one hand some Indian scholars claim Mahabharata time 3000 BC and on the another hand we see some events from the known history described in Mahabharata like the one quoted by Dr Narayanan. Kurus and Kambojas were in ancient Afghanistan and Iran from thousands of years. Indian scholars talk about Avesta and Vedas but keep quiet on dynasties from the ancient Afghanistan and Iran. Why this selective attitude? Any scholar has any views on these contradictions, please enlighten us. Thanks. N.R.Joshi
