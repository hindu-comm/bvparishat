The Nori Narasimha Sastry Charitable Trust is pleased to announce that the 8^(th) Bhagyanagar Veda Sabha would be conducted at Co-operative Community Hall, Next to Ramalayam,Nallakunta, Hyderabad on 23^(rd) September 2012, Sunday, from 8:30 am to 7:30 pm with a 2 hour break for lunch starting from 12:30 pm. **All are welcome.**

The *parīkṣa* method is followed wherein in each round, the President and Vice-President of the sabha start reciting a *panasa* (roughly fifty words) from a random point in each *kāṇḍa;* the next pair of scholars continues from where the President and Vice-President stop; thereafter the third pair continues from where the second pair stops; and so on till all the scholars present complete chanting one *panasa* each in pairs. There would be seven rounds to cover the seven *kāṇḍa*s of the samhitā part of the Krishna Yajurveda and three rounds to cover the *Brāhmaṇa*, and one to cover the *Āraṇyaka* and *Upaniṣat* portions.

*Ghanapāṭhis* would recite the *ghanapāṭha* of the *panasas* in the samhita; *Kramapāṭhis* would recite the*kramapāṭha*. Scholars of other branches of Veda, if present, would recite at the beginning or end of each round from the relevant portions of the particular branch. Only the *mūlam* is recited inthe four rounds of*Brāhmaṇa and Āraṇyaka.*

At the beginning, there would be puja (10 minutes or less) to the *Vedamātā*, and at the end *Ā**śīrvacana *(30 minutes), followed by felicitation of Vedic scholars (30 minutes) and distribution of *prasādam*. Lunch break is between 12:30pm and 2:30pm.
