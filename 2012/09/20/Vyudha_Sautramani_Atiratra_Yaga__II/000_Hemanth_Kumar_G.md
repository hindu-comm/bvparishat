Namaste,  
  
A special continuous Yaga named "VyuDha Sautramani  
Atiraatraa Yaga" Sankalpa has been done and the Poorva Siddhata  
Anustaanaas is being done from more than 6 months. It is intended to  
be a Deergha Satra for 1332 days starting from 25-10-2012 in the  
premises and branches of Veda-Vijnana Mandira, Chickmagalur,  
Karnataka, India.  
  
As per the Poorva Anustaanas Yaaga it is felt that the intention is to  
study the Moola Bhaagavata Sampradaaya in Agni with all its  
Karma-Samucchayas, Jnana-Samucchayas & Tantra-Samucchayas and  
uplifting of Maanava Dharma.  
  
There is no show-off of any kind. It is said to be  
Suddha-Saatvika-Ahimsaatmaka Yaaga which is done in as much as natural  
Dravyas like herbal plants, pulses, etc.,  
  
Organizer told that more details will be provided within few days.
