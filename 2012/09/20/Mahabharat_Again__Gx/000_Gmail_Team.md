Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



As I understanding from postings of Dr. N. Rajaram, he is visiting Boston area and giving lectures on his subject of liking.

Here I understood so far.



According to Dr. N.Rajaram, Harappa civilization was the tail end of the ancient Vedic civilization (time may be same as 3200 BC-2700BC) of the subcontinent.



According to Prof. Michael Witzel, Vedic civilization was at the tail end of Harappan (Indus civilization).



But nobody is expressing their viewson timingof the war described in the Epic Mahabharata..



In Rigveda there is description of war between Indra and Ladies Kingdom. In Atharvaveda there is mention of Gandhara, Munjavat and Bahlikas and Magadha.



Based on astronomical references in the Epic, some scholars say the Epic war took place in 3200 BC.

  
Please enlighten us if any new evidence has come forward that can throw some light on this problem. Thanks. N.R.Joshi
