The RV mantra developed in the concept of rebirth identical with the  
solar deity after the death. saavarNiH bhavitaa manuH in the  
Durgaasaptasati in the Markandeya Purana. the words and concept is  
absolutely similar. It is different in the case of a Ksatriya and a  
Vais'ya in their different objectives. But the common cause of action  
is the fraud by the near and dear relatives. Later, Guru Govind Singh  
also accepted this concept and reproduced it in his beautiful Candi di  
var which is less read these days. Regards, spnarang
