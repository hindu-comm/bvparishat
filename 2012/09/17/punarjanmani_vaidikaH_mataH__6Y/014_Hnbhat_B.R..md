Mr. Vidyashankar has hit the bulls eye. Just quoting many ambiguous lines seemingly to suggest do not either support or reject the view.

Now coming to the Upanishadic literature, It is the first time that Naciketa raised this question:

  

येयं प्रेते विचिकित्सा मनुष्येऽस्तीत्येके नायमस्तीति चैके।

एतद्विधामनुशिष्टस्त्वयाहं वराणामेष वरस्तृतीय:।। (1-1-20). in कठोपनिषत्।

  

that means the question was not solved at his time and is still debated after the issue raised by him was sought solution by different systems of philosophy which we are still enjoying and debating.

It is the continuation of the two views presented by Naciketa to be resolved by Yama the god of death himself, that Karmic deeds one way a solution supporting the rebirth. Hence the writer of the article in Viki, has left with a flat statement of his own, rebirth and re-death, which are interdependent words. Citations required remark by the editor.

  

  

So the question किं सत्यमेतत् needs some modification from the original query which was made on the statement of Konrad. It depends on the view, अप्रतिषिद्धमनुमतं भवति, is open to debate again, it does not either support or oppose either of the views leaves again in the midway. 

  

Thanks for the many inputs by different scholars.
