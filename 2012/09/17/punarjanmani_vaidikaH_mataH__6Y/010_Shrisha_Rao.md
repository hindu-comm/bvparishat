\> "Another novelty is the belief in reincarnation. It is not in the Vedas, no matter how internet Hindus look for it there. The Upanishadic Brahmins Uddalaka and Shvetaketu came to know about it from a Kshatriya (not coincidentally the caste to which the later Buddha and Mahavira belonged), and explicitly acknowledged it as a novelty, not implicated in the central Upanishadic doctrine of the Self or in the liberation from the false identification of the Self with the non-Self."

Several learned scholars have already answered this in detail, but one point to be noted is that the above claim is possible only for those who seek to separate the RV संहिता from the rest of the classical texts and parse it separately. Even for such, of course, we should note that the claim that reincarnation is not found in the RV is not acceptable to Madhva, cf. his statement यस्य त्रीण्युदितानि वेदवचने रूपाणि दिव्यान्यलम्, बट् तद्दर्शतमित्थमेव निहितं देवस्य भर्गो महत् -- etc., where the reference is to RV I-141, बळित्था तद्वपुषे धायि दर्शतं देवस्य भर्गः सहसो यति जनि, etc.  
  
The RV सूक्त that runs अहं मनुरभवं सूर्यश्चाहम् (IV-26) is the referent of the BU's अहं ब्रह्मास्मि, and therein the sage Vamadeva states that he was a ब्रह्मज्ञानी even while in his mother's womb, where he did not undergo suffering (because the Supreme Being had destroyed all the factors that cause great suffering to a normal fetus) and was furthermore fully realized and cognizant even in that condition, thanks to the merit of his past lives. This is also alluded to in the ब्रह्मसूत्र statement शास्त्रदृष्ट्या तूपदेशो वामदेववत् -- more can be understood by looking up the relevant literature.
