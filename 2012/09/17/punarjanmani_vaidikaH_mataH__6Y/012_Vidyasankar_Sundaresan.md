<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reincarnation>provides a nicely written overview of punarjanma/punarmRtyu from across the world. Members of this list should ponder about what scriptural sources informed the beliefs of the Greeksand the Celts and all the other variousnative groups of people in the world.



I think that coming to a conclusion that there is no support for punarjanma in the veda saMhita is a function of the "you live only once" saMskAra of the researcher.And on top of this is the legacy of 18th century European Indology, which continues to project on to the veda saMhitA the personal beliefs of 18th century European scholars. And there is the convenient category of the avaidika "other", SramaNa or Dravidian, to whichone can conveniently assign all other beliefs. It is ironic that Koenrad Elst, who is a strident criticof much of this, should say the same things.



The politics of Indology aside, frankly, in my opinion, the shoe is (or should be) on the other foot of the people/scholars who propound such views. The question they should really be asking is the following. Is there even one reference from the saMhitA-s that explicitly states or implicitly suggests that one human life is all there is? Are the references for punarjanma found amply in the AraNyaka and brAhmaNa texts contradicted even once by a saMhitA reference?



Best regards,
