Punarjanma belief(or concept or ideal) is derived from a concept  
already  
found in the Rigveda Samhita. While RV might not have said bluntly  
\`thou  
shalt be reborn' etc., there is sufficient clue to know from where  
the concept of rebirth has originated. Here, one has to first  
recollect the mechanism (before getting into Karma theory) as stated  
in the puranas and some Upanishads. Without going into details, it is  
through raindrops departed souls are attracted to earth. Almost all  
puranas describe this process. It is another matter that the present  
day urban Hindu has no appreciation to what  
the Puranas say! This principle is traceable to RV 1.164.50,51,52.  
Even Griffith's alien translation given below does not hide the  
"concept of life"  
coming back on earth after having attained heavenly heights:  
  
164.50 By means of sacrifice the Gods accomplished their sacrifice:  
these  
were the earliest ordinances. These Mighty Ones attained the height  
of heaven, there where the Sadhyas, Gods of old, are dwelling.  
51 Uniform, with the passing days, this water mounts and falls again.  
The tempest-clouds give life to earth, and fires re-animate the  
heaven.  
52 The Bird Celestial, vast with noble pinion, the lovely germ of  
plants, the germ of waters, Him who delighteth us with rain in  
season, Sarasvaan I invoke that he may help us.  
  
From the Mysore palace edition of RV it is understood "Sarasvaan" is  
worshipped for 'progeny'.  
If one sticks only to the literalistic meaning of verse 51, it is just  
the rainfall cycle, which is no doubt a very scientific observation.  
This in later period of the Puranas leads to the principle of  
conservation "that water is neither created nor destroyed" even when  
the oceans swell. But taken along with the other two verses, hymn 51  
may as well be the nucleus (beejaankura) of the 'punarjanma' concept.  
  
Personally I feel we should study RV and other texts from different  
perspectives instead of being easily satisfied with past commentaries  
who interpreted many vedic hymns from a world-view that was prevalent  
during their time without always investigating what the original seers  
might have wanted to convey.  
  
kind regards
