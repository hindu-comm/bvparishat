Hi!  
  
The Late Mahamhopadhyaya Panditaratnam Lakshmipuram Srinivasacharya, in  
his excellent work called "Mana-meya-rahasya-sloka-varttikam" running to  
over 6000 Sanskrit verses has covered exhaustively and comprehensively all  
concepts from all systems of philosophy and in that, section 22 deals with  
the concept 'time' as per all earlier thinkers, collated and critically  
presented in his inimitable style in 86 verses.  
  
You may access the same at my website:
