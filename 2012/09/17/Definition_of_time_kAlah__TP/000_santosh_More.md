Namaste Scholars !



I have been thinking about this for a while. Revered Swami Chinmayananda, in his eloquent discourses would define, 'Time' as aninterval between two thougths. Does any upanishad or prakarana granthas or any text discussor define "Time" . If one can give that defintion along with few references, that would be highly appreciated.



Aum Swasti,

Santosh
