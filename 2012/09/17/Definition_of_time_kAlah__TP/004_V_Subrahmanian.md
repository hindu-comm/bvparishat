Sir,  
  
In the Advaita shAstra 'time' is defined as: अविद्या-चित् संयोगः कालः.
The sUtasamhita 2.2.10 says: कालो मायात्मसंबन्धात् सर्वसाधारणात्मकः ।  
  
Chit, Pure Consciousness, is One and has no pravRtti as it has nothing to achieve. We know that any event has to take place in time alone.
The activity of sRShTi etc. can take place only when the 'other' shakti called avidyA/mAyA is admitted to work along with Chit. मयाध्यक्षेण प्रकृतिः सूयते सचराचरम् (भगवद्गीता). So, the concept of time is thus engendered only when this shakti is associated with Chit, Brahman. This 'association' samyogaH, itself is thus kAla since everything in sRShTi has to go on only in time.   
  
One can get more references to kAlaH at the sUtasamhitaa 1.8.23 to 26 verses.  
<http://archive.org/details/SutaSamhita-volume1>  
  
There is a very elaborate discussion on the concept of Time in the book 'SridakShiNAmUrtistotram' Vol.I English authored by Br. Sri D.S.Subbaramaiya and published by the Sringeri Peetham. Here on pages 327 to 342 there is an excellent exposition of the subject under a number of headings and numerous quotations from Sanskrit works:  
  

1.  kAla 2.  'Flow' of Time 3.  'Time' in various schools 4.  Vedantic view of Time 5.  Time revealed by sAkShI 6.  Time as an effect of AvidyA 7.  Time as AvidyA 8.  Time as relation between AvidyA and Brahman 9.  Time as KriyAshakti of Ishwara 10. Time as taTasthalakShaNa of Brahman the Timeless Entity 11. The 'Now' experience, fleeting image of Eternal 'Now' 12. 'Objects' situated in Space and Time

These are the topics under which 'Time' has been discussed. If you happen to see the book in any library you may read the same.
