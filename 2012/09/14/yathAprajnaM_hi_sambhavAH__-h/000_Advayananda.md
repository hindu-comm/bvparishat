Dear and respected Scholars,

Hari Om! Salutations.  
  

In Kathopanshad, Verse 2.2.7, we have this statement यथा कर्म यथा श्रुतम्। The word śrutam is explained as 'vijñānam' by Shri Shankaracharya. He validates this by a quotation: "यथाप्रज्ञं हि सम्भवाः"। This quotation is from Aitareya Brahmana 2.3.2.

I am interested to know the explanation of this Aitareya Brahmana quotation as provided by Shri Sayanacharya. Shall be very thankful for the same.

  

In Shri Guru Smriti,  
Advayananda
