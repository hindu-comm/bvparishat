Namaste:



 I admire your initiative in starting this much needed journal, but I feel the time allowed is too short. Based on experience I would say you should allow yourself (and authors and referees) 6 months at least before bringing out the inaugural issue.



 There is no way you can have quality papers written and reviewed and ready for publication in shorter time frame.



Sincere regards,

N.S. Rajaram
