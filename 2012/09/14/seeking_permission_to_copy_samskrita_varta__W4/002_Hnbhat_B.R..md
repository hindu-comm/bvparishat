I endorse Kulakarni's view. In addition, I can suggest one thing to achieve your objective. You can log in to the bvp group, with your membership ID,

  

<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/bvparishat/YVahB15nNIE>

  

Search for the topic you are interested and you can get link to the topic from the web page of the group itself, which you can share in your forum and all your members can read even without becoming the members of this group, as it is a public forum. Only if they want to post any topic, they need to be subscribed to this group. Otherwise, they can enjoy reading the topics discussed in this group, by logging in GoogleAccount. Here is a sample link to a topic of general information:

  

<https://groups.google.com/d/topic/bvparishat/YVahB15nNIE/discussion>

  

This can be read by anyone who have access to Google Accounts certainly. Even without Google Account, one can view the topic in any browser.

  

You also can share in the same way, any topic discussed in your forum or start a new topic with the name content, if you want further information on any topic even if already discussed in your group.

  

Since this is a public forum, any one can have access to the topic with access to the Internet.

  

With regards
