Hari OM!



Namaste!



I am writing on behalf of a YahooGroups forum ['samskritabh...@yahoogroups.com']().



You may be aware of the fact that Samskrita Bharati is an NGO dedicated to the cause of spreading Samskritam as a spoken language, notwithstanding the contention of scholars as to whether Samskritam was or not a spoken language in the ancient Bharat.



This forum aims to encourage Samskrita study and propagation by exchanging views and news about samskritam. We have a membership of more than 2000 persons from all walks of life. We also scan the Net to seize info related to samskritam and publish them in the forum only with the aim of propagating Samskrita Varta from whichever quarter they originate.



As a member of the 'bvparishat@googlegro[ups.com](http://ups.com)' I seek your permission to take samskrita news from there also and publish them in our forum only with the aim of giving importance to samskrita varta. Only Samskrita Varta like announcements of programmes, books release, honour to samskrita scholars, etc which are in the nature of 'News' only will be reproduced with due reference and credit given to
'bvparishat@googlegro[ups.com](http://ups.com)' for the source of the info.



Ours is not a forum dominated by samskrita scholars, and on the contrary many members are just students. So, you may not see the kind of scholarly discussions taking place on Samskrita grammar, linguistics or literature or any sastras.



Hopefully, you will consider my request favourably and accede to my request and allow me to reproduce the Samskrita Varta in our forum also.
