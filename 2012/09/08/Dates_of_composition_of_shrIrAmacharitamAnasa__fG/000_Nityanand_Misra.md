Namaste  
  
There is internal evidence (अन्तःसाक्ष्य) in the Śrīrāmacaritamānasa that Gosvāmī Tulasīdāsa began its composition on the Rāmanavamī day of Vikrama Saṃvat 1631. There is external evidence (बहिःसाक्ष्य) in the work "गोसाईं चरित" of Bābā Veṇī Mādhava Dāsa that the work took 2 years, 7 months and 26 days to complete and was completed on the day of Vivāha Pañcamī.  
  
Using Jyotiṣa, Dr. Ramadhar Sharma of Patna (who is also a mathematician) has derived the dates corresponding the Gregorian calender in the article attached. As per the computations, Gosvāmī Tulasīdāsa began composing the magnum opus on March 30, 1574 AD and completed the work on November 25, 1576 AD.  
  
Those interested may read the article attached (in Hindi) for the derivation of these dates and insights by Dr. Ramadhar Sharma.  
  
Thanks, Nityanand
