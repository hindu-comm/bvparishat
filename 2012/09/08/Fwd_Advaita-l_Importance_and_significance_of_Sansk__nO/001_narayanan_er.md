Dear Subrahmanian Sir,

One of our scholar friends had already conveyed through this forum earlier on. Still thanks for reminding it again. Personally I have directly heard His Holiness' affluent speech of clarity on Vedanta, Nyaya, Mimamsa and Vyakarana during the Caturmasya period, indicates His Holiness' achievement of proficiency in all these four schools within a short span of time. Apart from understanding the doctrines of those concerned schools, you will hear almost all types of conjugations, especially benedective mood and aorist past in active and passive used affluent even in short speeches. I felt that His Holiness is teaching the world how Sanskrit should be served. It is clear that those who listen to His Holiness' speech will certainly to be attracted to Sanskrit and the Sastras.

Regards,

Narayanan
