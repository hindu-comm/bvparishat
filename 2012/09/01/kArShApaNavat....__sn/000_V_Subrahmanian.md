Namaste  
  
Recently we had occasion to see the expression .. चतुष्पात् *कार्षापणवत्,* in another thread. I found a close similarity between the 'कार्षापण’ and some Tamil and Kannada usages. In Tamil there is a usage: 'kAsu-paNam' or 'paNam-kAsu' or simply paNam and kAsu to denote money/wealth. In Kannada too this usage is there: 'haNa-kAsu' or simply 'kAsu' and 'haNa'. There is also a Kannada usage 'paNa' to mean a bet/prize money. I do not know if there is a similar usage in other languages. Anandagiri while commenting on the above word in Shankara bhashya mentioned :देशविशेषे..meaning in certain parts of the country ..
