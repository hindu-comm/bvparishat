Dear Colleagues,

The ongoing discussion on the usage of the word *kārṣāpaṇa* in Sanskrit and modern Indian languages is interesting but kindly forgive this interference that is being done in a friendly way.

The main issue here is not the usage of the word *kārṣāpaṇa* which will be found in its Apabhraṃśa varieties in many Indian languages, *eg.*
*kāhan* ‘ṭākā’ or ‘rupee’ in medieval-Bengali, ‘a lot’ figuratively in modern Bengali. Śaṅkara’s purpose was to bring out the difference of the four *padas* that is ‘feet‘ of a cow and the four pādas that is component ‘quarters’ of a whole. A cow has four feet that do not make the whole cow while the quarters that is ‘one-fourth’ of the kārṣāpaṇa make for its entire set of components because there is nothing apart from its four quarters in the kārṣāpaṇa.

But Śaṅkara misses one point. The four quarters of Brahman are graded in the Māṇḍūkya- Gauḍapāda scheme and are not on the same plane as they are in the kārṣāpaṇa.

A full discussion of the transformation of the four padas on the same plane in the Saṃhitās, the Bṛhadāraṇyaka and the Chāndogya to the scheme of a graded four pādas and its up-side-down turn in the Maitrī Upaniṣad prior to the appearance of the Māṇḍūkya will be found in ‘The doctrine of four in the early Uapaniṣads etc’ in the *Journal of Indian philosophy* Vol. 6, 1978, pp.1-34. The most interesting point in the Saṃhitā scheme, according to me, is that the Tūrīya is human in it while the other three are divine. So also in the Gītā *ekāṃśena sthitaṃ jagat*. But, from the Maitrī onward one finds also the inversed scheme where the Tūrīya is divine and the other three are below it. The inversed catuṣpāda scheme closely resembles the little known catuṣkāya scheme in Maitreyanātha’s Abhisamayālankārakārikā. The inversed catuṣpāda reigns in the Minor Upaniṣads and in the borrowings made from them in later Tantric Buddhism under the catuṣkāya denomination. Bhartrhari, however, is vague and subject to double interpretation.

I request forgiveness for a long submission.

Best

DB
