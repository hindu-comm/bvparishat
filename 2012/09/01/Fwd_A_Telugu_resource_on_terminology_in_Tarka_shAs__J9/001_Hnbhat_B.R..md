It is purely in Telugu Language, except some technical explanations available in other texts reproduced in Sanskrit as they are available. In Tarkasangrahasarvasva, there is already a section devoted to पारिभाषिकपदार्थसंग्रह and in detail there is न्यायकोश which serves as an encyclopeadia. Hence it will be useful only for Telugu knowing Sanskrit people, at least students.

  

Thanks for the same.
