Dear Sh. Narayanan  
  
That's a beautiful verse you composed, and going by it, nobody would agree you are not a poet! I am humbled. Thanks also for correcting me - I thought the verse was from Lilavati but you are right - it is from BIjaganitam.  
  
As you requested, please see the solution to the Bijaganitam's 113th verse. The second monkey jumps to a height of 50 hand-lengths.  
  
Same concepts are used - Pythagoras Theorem, Binomial Expansion and Linear Equation in One Variable (एकवर्णसमीकरणम्). Note that भास्कराचार्य uses the technical term श्रुतिपथ which means the "path of the hypotenuse" of a right-angled triangle. The Hindi medium mathematics books in Uttar Pradesh use the term कर्ण for the hypotenuse.  
  
Now I will eagerly wait for your शार्दूलविक्रीडितम्. As a request, please use the अङ्कानां वामतो गतिः principle and Samskrita names of numbers (e.g. ब्रह्म=1, अक्षि=2, अग्नि=3, श्रुति=4, बाण = 5, रस=6, द्वीप=7, वसु=8, ग्रह=9).  
  
Finally, thanks a lot to Sh. Hemanth Kumar and you - you made me remember my high-school Mathematics teacher from Kendriya Vidyalaya (Junagadh), Sh. Pawan Kumar Gupta of Mainpuri, Uttar Pradesh, who gave us many problems of Bhaskara from Lilavati and Bijaganitam to solve in classes 9th and 10th. May he have a long life.  
  
Thanks, Nityanand
