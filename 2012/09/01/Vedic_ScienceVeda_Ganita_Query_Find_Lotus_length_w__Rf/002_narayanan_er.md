Dear Sh. Nityanand,

I am neither a poet nor a mathematician. Thank you for putting verse 112 of Bhaskara's Bijaganita. You are well a mathematician and provided the progression and answer too. I take this challenge to make a Mandakranta with the answer to the question you have already provided. Being too week in mathematics, I can hardly calculate anything like this. It is not easy to bring that environment of birds, lotus, breeze and waves like Bhaskara brought for us. Still, here is my answer:  

  

पद्मस्याग्रं स्पृशति सलिलं मानतश्चेद्वितस्तं  
नित्यानन्दो गणनकुशलः संगणय्येति तत्त्वम्।  
अर्धादर्धं प्रगतिरुदिता तावदूर्ध्वं तडागे  
सार्धैका सा जलपरिमितिर्ह्युच्चलद्धस्तयुग्मा।।

  

Puzzles like this are always interesting. But mathematics is utterly beyond my reach. You can teach me by putting verse 113 of Bhaskara's Bijaganita answered. Then I may try for a Sardulavikridita answer. Thanks, Sh. Nityanand.

Regards,

Narayanan
