Dear Sh. Hemanth Kumar  
  
This problem from Lilavati can be solved without going into trigonometry or other higher concepts. All you need is the concepts of Pythagoras Theorem, Binomial Expansion and Linear Equation in One Variable. All three concepts were known at the time of Bhaskara I\|. The Pythagoras Theorem is known from शुल्बसूत्र and Binomial Expansion coefficients can be known from what हलायुध refers as मेरुप्रस्तार, an old concept attributed to पिङ्गल.  
  
Anyway कोयादूर्ध्वम् is incorrect, it is तोयादूर्ध्वम् and here is the complete correct verse (a beautiful मन्दाक्रान्ता on top of it!!)  
  
चक्रक्रौञ्चाकुलितसलिले क्वापि दृष्टं तडागे तोयादूर्ध्वं कमलकलिकाग्रं वितस्तिप्रमाणम् ।  
मन्दं मन्दं चलितमनिलेनाहतं हस्तयुग्मे तस्मिन्मग्नं गणक कथय क्षिप्रमम्बुप्रमाणम् ॥  
  
वितस्तिप्रमाणम् = One hand-span  
हस्तयुग्मे = lotus submerges in the pond at a distance of 2 hand-spans from its original location.  
  
Refer the graphic for the solution, the depth of the water is 1.5 hand-spans. The Pythagorean triplet is (1.5,2,2.5) which corresponds to the simplest Pythagorean triplet of (3,4,5).  
  
I leave it to the poets and scholars to give the answer in मन्दाक्रान्ता.  
  
Thanks, Nityanand
