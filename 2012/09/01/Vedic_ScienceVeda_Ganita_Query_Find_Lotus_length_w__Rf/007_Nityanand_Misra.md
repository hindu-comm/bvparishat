Dear Sh. Narayanan  
  
Very beautiful and nice. Two doubts:  

1.  The second foot is one syllable too short - did you miss a syllable
    while typing? By changing त्रिशतं to त्रिशतकं or to खखतपं (ख=0,
    ख=0, तप=अग्नि=3) or शतत्रयं with the त as लघु would make it
    perfect.  
2.  In the last foot, is विद्वान्नाप्यपरिश्रमोऽस्मि to be split as
    विद्वान् न अपि अपरिश्रमः अस्मि?

Regards, Nityanand
