If this was only the intention, you could have concluded with containing only the question, you wanted to know.

  

Even the topic had been already declared, it is not better to post more replies in the topic. As a rule, it is limited to the forms that could not be accomplished with the normal rules applicable to भाषा, and unless otherwise specified by Panini, all the rules apply equally to भाषा and छन्दस्. No contraction is needed and it is not flexible.

  

This is my note as a moderator on seeing the replies coming in after the topic was closed. The intention on closing the topic to avoid undue prolongation of the topic on grammatical issue of a particular work. In case, you want, you can go to the following rule:

  

<http://sanskritdocuments.org/learning_tools/sarvanisutrani/3.1.85.htm>

  

and वैदिकप्रक्रिया in सिद्धान्तकौमुदी can be consulted. This message box is too limited for covering all the Vedic usages.
