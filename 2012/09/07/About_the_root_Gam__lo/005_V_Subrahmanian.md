Thank you Sir for the explanation. It is indeed very useful. Pl. say something about the word अधिगमः . I think it is not much different from अवगमः. I came across a usage: सुसमधिगतमेतत्. How many upasargas!! Could you pl. present here such usages where so many upasargas are used in one place? It would be interesting to go thru them.  
  
Also, there is a usage among householders in Karnataka: बलीहरणम् where the offered naivedyam is partly segragated, after naivedyam, for further offering to others. Here the हार/हरणम् takes a different meaning, I suppose, from स्तेनः. Pl. elucidate.  
  
Warm regards
