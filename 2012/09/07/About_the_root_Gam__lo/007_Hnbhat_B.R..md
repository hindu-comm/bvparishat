"*सर्वे गत्यर्थाः*ज्ञानार्थाः ।" is accepted generally.

  

But अधि and अव are used to convey the meaning to know. अधिगच्छति शास्त्रार्थः - अवगतम्, अनवगतम् is commonly used one. Both are in the sense to know, but अधि has got some more shade of meaning. अधिगतशास्त्रार्थः will be conveying one who has acquired the meaning of शास्त्र as well as one who has known the शास्त्रार्थ. Both "गति" and "ज्ञान" are simultaneously, while अवगच्छति, अवगतम् - conveys knows, understands, or understood. Depends on usage. If u stick strictly to the prefix meaning, it will literally mean to go down, which is never intended by the usage of the verb with this prefix. And, to avoid confusion, to go down, one can use अधो गच्छति than or अवतरति - the same, prefix with another verb of motion, तॄ प्लवनतरणयोः, which is not used even though it is गत्यर्थ in the place of अवगच्छति.

Practically there is no limit to the number of prefixes attached to a verb, but depending on the usage. Mr. Narayanan has already referred to a good book, while I was typing this, Upasargarthacandrika by Carudevashastri, which contains wide range of examples drawn from Vedic and Classical Litrature, in alphabetical order.

It should be बलिहरणम् - offering बलि. बलेः हरणम् - It may be for भूत, पितृ or any other deities customized. but not for used for the "naivedya" offered to gods, i.e. used in देवपूजा. पितृबलि is common, in वायसबलि is part of daily routine in households, after देवपूजा. It seems to be part of पञ्चयज्ञ-s to be performed by a गृहस्थ, to please ब्रह्म-देव-पित्रतिथिभूत-s respectively daily.

At least, the word बलिहरण is part of सांवत्सरिक-श्राद्ध where it is offered to other पितृ-s than वसु-रुद्र-आदित्य-s for whom पिण्ड is offered regularly.

This is what I can get by the usage of बलिहरण as part of daily पञ्चयज्ञ-s or abridged version of it.

Hence it is called वायस-बलि also, and the काक is known by the epithet बलिभुक्.

The above is the usage of Kalidasa.
