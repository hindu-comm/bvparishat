Dear Krishnaprasad,

Sorry, yesterday by mistake I did not answered your chat. The meaning  
or import, to be more specific, is rather simple. It is some thing of  
an anyOkti. If a buffalo or jackal are made big in the world of forest  
animals what an elephant has to do? It has to suffer in this marsh.  
Who else could avoid the good or bad results of fate?

regards

ganesh
