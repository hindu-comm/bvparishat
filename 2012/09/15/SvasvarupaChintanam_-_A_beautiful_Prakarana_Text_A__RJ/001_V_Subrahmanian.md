Namaste Shri Anjaneyulu gAru,  
  
It is ironical that you take the name of Sri Shankaracharya in the invocation to  
render a composition of someone who is an adversary of the former.  
  
Maybe you were naturally prompted to say this in your upload information about the author:  
  
//The work addresses questions like what I am, what I am not, what God is and what the relation between me and God is, from a Advaitin.//  
  
because the hymn is so unmistakably reminiscent of Advaitic works like the 'DashashlokI' and the 'nirvANaShaTkam' of Shankaracharya and the 'Hastaamalakastotram' of His disciple.
