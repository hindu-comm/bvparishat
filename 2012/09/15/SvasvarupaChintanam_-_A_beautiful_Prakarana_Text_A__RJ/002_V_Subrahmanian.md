Dear Shri Misra,  
  
But there is 'prasiddhi' of this verse as denoting the Advaita sampradaya:  
  
<http://adbhutam.wordpress.com/2009/08/17/shankaracharya-and-gitacharya/>  
  
Those in the Vedanta tradition, I mean the three schools, will immediately recognize this verse as belonging to/denoting Advaita sampradaya alone.

But there is 'prasiddhi' of this name in Lord Shiva. Even though names such as 'शर्वः, शिवः, स्थाणुः' are in the श्रीविष्णुसहस्रनाम still these names are not used to invoke Lord Vishnu or Shri Rama. We do not say ’ रघुकुलतिलकः / अयोध्यापतिः / दाशरथिः / जानकीनाथः / कोसलेयः शंकरः’ .

Again by the name शङ्कराचार्यः the world recognizes the Advaita Acharya alone. The name is prasiddha in this sense alone. If रामभद्राचार्यः can mean शङ्कराचार्यः one can very well replace the former's name with the latter's in all the colophons of the former's compositions and see what a confusion it will bring about.

There is prasiddhi for using 'nigama' for 'veda'. But no such prasiddhi is there for using 'shankara' for 'rAma'. In one place Sri Appayya Dikshitar has used the name 'lakshmaNa' to denote 'rAmAnuja':  
  
आनन्दतीर्थमुनिलक्ष्मणदेशिकेन्द्रश्रीकण्ठयोगिपदवीरदवीयसीर्नः ।  
आचार्पादसरणिञ्च विविच्य बोद्धुं संगृह्यते मतचतुष्टयसारलेशम् ॥ (चतुर्मतसारसंग्रहः mangala shlokaH)  
  
Outside this context hardly anyone would relate 'lakshmana' to 'rAmAnujaachArya'.

Even without interpreting the entire work in Advaitin light, the work as it is can pass off as an Advaitic one as it happened to Shri Anjaneyalu. The only apparent/possible differentiating factor could be the refrain: राघवीयो जनोऽहम् . Even here as per Sri Madhusudana Saraswati's method expressed in these three ways, graduating in this order:  १. तस्यैवाहम् २. ममैवासौ ३. स एवाहम् the work will be considered to be the first step leading to a culmination later in the Advaitic identity of the type: शिवः केवलोऽहम्, शिवोऽहम् शिवोऽहम् or the VivekachuDaamani verse: नारायणोऽहं नरकान्तकोऽहम्....  
  
Also there is the more closer connection, synonym, between 'rAma(bhadra)' and 'rAghava'. But the verse says: राघवीयः instead of ideally being राघवोऽहम् .

Just for the sake of those who may not be familiar with the method of claiming the 'aikyam', 'identity' in Advaita let me state briefly: When all the ignorance-born accretions of the body-mind complex are negated as not belonging to the Self, the Pure Consciousness, and by negating all the attributes to Brahman which accrue to It ONLY relative to the world/jiva-s and therefore not forming its essential nature which is just Pure Consciousness, this natural identity emerges.
