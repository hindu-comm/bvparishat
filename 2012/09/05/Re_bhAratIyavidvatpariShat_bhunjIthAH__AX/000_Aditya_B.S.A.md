Sri Vidyasankar,

  

It is very easy for someone to stir up controversy and get the mods to step in. You are attempting to scuttle genuine discussion that could be very helpful to many people who just want to learn. There are still unanswered questions in this thread, purely grammatical. It is left to the scholars to address them, if they are so willing. If they remain unanswered, it is our loss.

  

I repeat to you what I stated in another thread: You may accuse people who subscribe to different viewpoints of being biased etc., only if you can point out where the 'predispositions' mar their judgement. I would like to see you back up your vacuous allegations in this manner, with respect to a single statement made by Sri Nityananda. In your petulant reply, you seem to have forgotten your own statement: 'This one exception trumps all the tomes of grammar that anyone can cite in this regard.'Thus, in the context of grammar, there is nothing wrong with the citations made in the first post. You are just being disruptive by rousing emotion. 

  

On another point, when Sri Subrahmanian has been kind enough to consult with a traditional scholar and present his knowledge in a previous thread, the access he shares with the scholar makes it only reasonable that he might present his views on this topic, as well. After all, getting an advaita standpoint across would be much easier for an advaitin, wouldn't you agree?

  

I request you to keep the thread germane. Sri Veeranarayana has already yellow-carded both of us. Now it's only fair that we wait in the sidelines for further developments.

  

Regards,

  

Aditya.
