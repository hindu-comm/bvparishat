Sorry, I didn't reply precisely.

  

If u are particular about the naming after the "phala" or indicating the resultant form, the technical word used by "8-3-15*खरवसानयोर्विसर्जनीयः*" the name should be विसर्जनीयसन्धिः, than विसर्गसन्धि which more common in use in Indian languages.  
  
Sorry I forgot to add this note in my previous message.
