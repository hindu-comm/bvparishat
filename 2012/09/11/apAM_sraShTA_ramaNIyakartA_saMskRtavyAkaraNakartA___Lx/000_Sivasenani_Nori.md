Sirs and Mesdames  
  
I have a doubt regarding the usage "pANinih samskritavyAkaraNakartA"  
with which sentence the lesson on Panini starts for second year degree  
students (with Sanskrit as second language) in AP.  
  
I know that there is a difference in explanations of i) तृजकाभ्यां  
कर्त्तरि (trijakaabhyaam karttari) 2.2.15, ii) कर्त्तरि च (karttari  
ca) 2.2.16, and iii) अके जीविकार्थे (ake jivIkArthe) 6.2.73 amongst  
the Mahabhashyakrit, the two authors of KaaSikA vritti and Bhattoji  
Dikshita. Clearly, the ramaNIyakartA example of KaaSikaa and KaumudI  
does not sit comfortably with what has been said in those very books  
under trijakaabhyaam karttari and karttari ca.  
  
Such being the position, is the usage vyAkaraNakartA acceptable? Is it  
okay if one uses such words in one's own essays?  
  
Regards  
N. Siva Senani
