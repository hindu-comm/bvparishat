There are different versions of Paniniya Shiksha. Here is one re-constructed text of Paniniya Shiksha, with the translation and notes (for the reconstructed text), with all the available versions. Two commentaries are also included in the edition. Hope this will be helpful. There is detailed Introduction also in English. Only 18 verses common to all therecessions are retained in the reconstructed text. Others are discussed in the notes.
