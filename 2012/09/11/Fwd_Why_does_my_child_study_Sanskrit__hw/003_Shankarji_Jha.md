\> Dear Shankarji,  
\>  
\> I was already familiar with the school in London (the St James School) run by the School of Philosophy that includes Sanskrit in its curriculum but I did not know that there was also one in Dublin.  
\>  
\> While I think that introducing schoolchildren to Sanskrit is a good idea for any that are at all gifted in language learning, it is regrettable that Rutger Kortenhorst's address to parents at the school includes to many outdated and even incorrect statements about Sanskrit. Languages don't die but (as he in fact recognises for English) perpetually change, sometimes so much that for convenience we give the later form a different name. Sanskrit is not the completely unchanging language that he claims; Vedic Sanskrit evolved into classical Sanskrit and there are the variant forms of epic Sanskrit and Buddhist Sanskrit, quite apart from the changes in vocabulary that occurred over the centuries. Sanskrit further evolved, of course, into the Prakrits, then the Apabhramsas and the modern North Indian languages. But his claim is true to the limited extent that Sanskrit as a learned language, used for literary and for religious purposes, remained relatively static over a very long period, but the same is in fact true for Latin, which filled a similar role within European culture. \[His lecture also implicitly perpetuates the old misunderstanding that Sanskrit is somehow at the base of all other languages, which linguistic specialists have long abandoned as incorrect.\] He also seems to imply that Sanskrit is in a sense an artificial language, "it is completely structured and thought out", which would make it rather like Esperanto and others, which have never caught on; so this is no recommendation.  
\>  
\> The true uniqueness of Sanskrit lies in its comprehensive description by Panini and the subsequent schools of grammarians, which includes the accuracy of analysis of its phonetic system (and so of its written form in the devanagari and other scripts). Kortenhorst is therefore right to emphasise the way in which the study of Sanskrit encourages accuracy of thought and logical patterns of thought. Unfortunately, though, much of what he said shows a lack of logic and/or concern for accuracy. So I applaud his enthusiasm for the language but regret the extent to which the arguments he brings forward are outdated and erroneous.
