Dear Sri Bholanath,

  

The "chhalAksharam" is a method of detecting errors in the texts of Sama Veda - both Archika and Gaanam. The single aksharam

printed at the end of each rk or saaman is determined by the preceding swara markings.

  

Please refer the introduction to Sri Damodar Satvalekar's text on Samaveda-samhita (published by Swadhyaya Mandal) for an explanation and some examples.

  

Regards,

-Shreyas
