Best to avoid propagating hoaxes. There are many such circulating at any given time, often with tell-tale signs (unnecessary large fonts and colors, alarming/exciting content at first read but no proper attribution or authorship, etc.).

No, hardly. It can be easily seen by going to that URL that it is called a HOAX, with a big red button next to it!
