Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



The name of the country Sweden is Sverige (Svarye).

Swedish language has many words which show closeness to Sanskrit words.

Swedish Sanskrit

Tre Tri

Nio Nava

Geni Jnani

Midja Madhya

Nagel Nakha

Dotter Duhitr’

Madeira MadirA

Ko Go

Nasa NAsikA

Sta SthA

Uttal UccAra



There is description of very long Dawn in Rigveda (7.76.3)

Sweden has very long day and night. So long dawn is expected.

From the Marathi book (of R. D. Joshi), “ A Different Introduction to Rigveda”.



Any thoughts on this information? Somewhere in the ancient scriptures,there is information that Svarga was beyond RasA (RanhA) river.

Thanks. N.R.Joshi
