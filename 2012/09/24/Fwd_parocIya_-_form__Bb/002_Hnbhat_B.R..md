If the धातुपाठ has got ची also in some धातुपाठ, not recorded in Madhava, as long one, the explanation would be correct. But there is not any such variants or any other root as ची. The interpretation expects such a root normal, as:

  

परिचीय - निश्चित्य, अनुभूय .. .. .. etc. without any remark.  

  

Narayanan's remark has hit the mark. Google search for परिचीय landed on परिवीय (परि+व्येञ्), but the meaning is clearly wanted as above.

  

Onlly चीञ् variable with चिञ् with the same meaning, would yield the meaning.

  

That is the problem also raised. It could not be derived with the common verb prefixed with परि+चिञ् - परिचिनोति। The passive form is already given as

  

परिचीयते in the other quotation from विवेकचूडामणि itself.
