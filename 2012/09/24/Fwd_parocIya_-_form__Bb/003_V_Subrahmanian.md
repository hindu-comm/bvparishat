Sir,  
  
A renowned scholar gave exactly the above explanation when I consulted him. I did not know about the above explanation given by you when I asked him. He said: PANini has said at the end of his dhAtupAThaH: बहुलमेतन्निदर्शनम् - What has been listed by pANini in the pATha is not exhaustive, that is, not all usages in currency have been included by him. There is room for one to 'include' as and when the necessity arises the appropriate dhAtus and bring about the शब्दनिष्पत्तिः by using the यथोचितप्रक्रिया. It is said the siddhAntakaumudi has commented: केचिदपठिता अपि बोध्याः.
