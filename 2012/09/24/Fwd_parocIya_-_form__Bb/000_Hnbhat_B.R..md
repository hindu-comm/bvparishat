Dear Subrahmanym.

  

Can the above be justified in the above context? Please help.

  

परि+चिञ् चयने will have परिचित्य, like विचित्य, निश्चित्य etc. forms. But the above परिचीय is could not be justified as per Panini.

  

The above line is said to be of Shringeri Swamiji.

  

  

parAtmAnam: the paramatman.

shvayamiti: svasvarupam iti: as being one’s own real nature.

paricIya: niscitya,anubhuya: determining, realising.

brahmarupeNa tiSTha: remain as such Brahman.

If the person is not counselled thus to remain as such brahman, when all the five sheaths have

been negated and as a man is said to be made of these five sheaths only, may be led to

conclude that there is nothing else substantial thereafter. This might lead to anAtmavAda if it is

not accepted that the brahman alone is atman.

Hence, the admonition brahmarupena tistha: remain
