hariH OM,  
Dr. Ramanujan,  
  
 has cdac (or anybody else) digitized, or has any plans of digitizing the veda / brAhmaNa bhAShyas (sAyaNa, bhaTTabhAskara etc.)?  
  
 recently i downloaded the taittiriiya bhaTTabhAskara bhAShya (mahadeva shastri and shama shastri, the former from univ of mysore, the latter from motilal banarsidas) images from DLI, but it seems like many volumes of the bhAShyas of taittiriya samhitA (6 and 7 vols) and brAhmaNa (many) are missing.  
  
 i request you to share the link in case the bhAShyas have already been digitized.  
  
svasti,  
 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,  

shrivathsa.
