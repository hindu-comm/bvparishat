Forwarded here is an announcement of a fine work in Sanskrit verse that at once appeals to the seeker and prompts further contemplation. The announcement was made in the Advaitin forum.

Namaste  
  
Many thanks for sharing this simple yet profound work. It provides a base for  
contemplation. Vedanta sAdhana, adhikArI, viShaya, phalam, sambandha, the  
sequence etc. contained in the verses are truly appreciable. It is indeed an  
invaluable gift to the seeking humanity.
