hariH OM,  
shrii mishra,  
  
"Netiquette says that one does not add additional recipients unknown to the addresse without introducing them. It is too much to expect that from you. From my side, I apologize in advance for writing to people I do not know personally - I am resorting to Reply All as netiquette demands."  
 quibble. hardly a need to answer to this. Suffice to say this: You don't have any qualms in  

1.  raining expletives on your opponents in a logical debate of
    opinions. I came to know that you have used pejoratives against
    honest sajjanas. There is no need to name them here.  
2.  Bull-headedly stick to your dogmas flying in the face of scriptural
    and scholarly opinion. 3.  Attributing motives and railing at honest scholars replying to you
    thinking your questions to be genuine.

but when there is a lapse of "netiquette", your hackles are always raised. Needless to say that those who have no substantive issues to discuss get down to just the nitty gritty fine-print, details etc. in other words, when found short of content, they will resort to questioning form!  
  
"Glad you \[or somebody else?\] corrected the grammatical errors"  
 I have never claimed absolute scholarship about anything and I am very happy to have received corrections from well meaning friends. Even when I sent the group the corrections, I didn't claim that I identified the errors. By the way, there was one great scholar who talked to me yesterday who was LMAO-ing about your shloka. He will never write to you about your errors because he knows that you won't take them humbly (while in my case they did the opposite than laughing it away). Sad for you isn't it? If you stop being a bull in a china (or is it hong-kong) shop, you will get a lot more friends and you will stand to gain (sorry for this uninvited advice, thought of writing this because of my friendly concern for you).  
 I am aware of one error which stayed inspite of the corrections. But what is the point? True humility (which I am aspiring for) requires one to accept one's mistakes when pointed out.  
  
", the so-called टीका is unfortunately incomplete and still has errors.The meaning is very different from my own translation, so I am not sure if it can be called a टीका at all. Anyway I will leave it here."  
 hahahahaha... come on niti, you aren't so "bhola" after all. I just used your own shloka against your position, in my own way! call it whatever you want, i called it a Tiikaa.  
  
"Just for your knowledge, there are some errors there - the list is not exhaustive though :). I will first go through the verses in your original mail and then those in your following one."  
 I am grateful to the extreme for you to have taken the pains to point out the mistakes in my padyas (with you I use sarcasm, but here, i.e. in this paragraph, I am being contrite). I will be ever grateful to you if you point out my mistakes in the future. I know Hindi only as a third language (something I left studying after my primary school) and am not conversant with poetic expressions at all, leave alone hindii, i haven't used poetic expressions in kannaDa or english which i know better than hindii. In fact, I took your padyas as templates and wrote my padyas. These padyas were padyas composed on the trot and not sufficiently deliberated or cogitated upon. This is not to say that if I had cogitated / deliberated sufficiently, I would have come up with error free verses. There is where friends like you are of help :-)  
  
 Thanks again for taking the pains to go through the verses with a fine toothed comb. I will reflect upon them and enrich myself and my hindii.

  
  
svasti,  
 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,  

shrivathsa.
