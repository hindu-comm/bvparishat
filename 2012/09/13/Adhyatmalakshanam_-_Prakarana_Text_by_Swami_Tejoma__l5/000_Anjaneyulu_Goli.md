All are interested in Spirituality. What is Spirituality? How to be Spiritual? Who is God? How to identify spirituality in our self and others? This quest has been the foundation for all the great spiritual teachings.  
  
Swamy Tejomayanand gave lucid answers for all such questions in his Prakarana Text ' AdhyatmaLakshanam'. Listening and remembering this bestows Peace and Bliss.
