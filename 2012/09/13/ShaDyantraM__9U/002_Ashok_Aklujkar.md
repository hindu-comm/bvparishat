The word is used, at least in Marathi, in the sense of 'conspiracy, plot.' Its origin probably lies in the .sa.d gu.nas or .saa.dgu.nya (sandhi vigraha etc.) of the Artha-;saastra tradition.

  

The constitution of the word is clearly Sanskritic. It should not surprise us if some words and meanings not attested in the surviving Sanskrit literature survive in the modern Indian languages that descended from Sanskrit or borrowed vocabulary from Sanskrit.
