The act(s) done against *ShaDguNa sampatti* may be called as ShaDyantra. The name of the *ShaDguNa sampatti*s may vary in different shaastras. Some times ShaDguNas are *aishvarya, viirya, yashas, shrii, j\~naana, vairaagya.* In Rasaayana Shastra its the act against Shadruchis. But common usage is with respect to Raajya Shastra, where a cunning act is done against other person, property, position etc., Those acts may be classified as 6 basic types under a common name Shadyantra. As per my suspect this word is from Arthaveda, a lost upaveda of Atharva.
