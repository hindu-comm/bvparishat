SrimadBhAgavatapArAyanam - Regular recitation or Paarayanam and sravanam or listening of Krishna's greatness and singing His praises at all times are beneficial activities that purify the mind. Hence our elders prescribed pArayanam. There is also a procedure with opening and closing verses. Listening those verses bestows Peace and Bliss.
