Respected Scholars,  
  
Kalidasa uses in Raghuvamsa 6.48:  
यस्यावरोधस्तनचन्दनानां प्रक्षालनाद्वारिविहारकाले ।  
कलिन्दकन्या मथुरां गतापि गङ्गोर्मिसंसक्तजलेव भाति ॥  
This is the discription by Sunanda the guide of Indumati in the latter's Swayamvara of the king Sushena of Shurasenas. According to Kalidasa he has put these words in the mouth of his character who lives before Shatrughna. Mathura city came into existence, according to lore when Shatrughna slayed demon Lavanasura. This according to the character Sunanada should not have known that name! Same doubt is raised by Hemadri in his Darpana and some edition of Mallinatha's commentary. Is it a kind of defect by the poet? How far such such usage is justified when apart from the poetical angle, historicity is also taken into account?  
Next verse 6.49 also says :  
त्रस्तेन तार्क्ष्यात्किल कालियेन मणिं विसृष्टं यमुनौकसा यः ।  
वक्षःस्थलव्यापिरुचं दधानः सकौस्तुभं ह्रेपयतीव कृष्णम् ॥  
Here too how this character Sunanda came to know the Krishnavatara of Dwapara when she still lives in Treta?  
  
Can scholars throw light on this kind of incongruity?
