Dear Sri Shivasenaani,  
  
Your views are true and as is the case of Telugu so is that of Kannada  
and Malayaalam. Even Tamil derives much from Sanskrit.Since long I  
have been writing on these aspects and a book will follow soon by me  
in Kannada. Thanks for sharing your keen observations. I have also  
noticed these and the like during my studies in Telugu.  
  
  
regards  
  
ganesh
