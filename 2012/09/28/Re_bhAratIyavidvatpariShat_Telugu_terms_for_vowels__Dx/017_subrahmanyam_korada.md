नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

When I did भाषाप्रवीण (equal to B A) from 1971-75 (five years) there used to be all major Telugu Grammars , Chandas , Literature , Sanskrit Grammar(five papers) etc. Now it is Oriental B A - a highly diluted course  
  
Just like Panini , we used to get by heart the Telugu Gr works also . Hundreds of Telugu poems from Bharatam , Bhagavatam , Pancakavyas etc. were (and still are) on the tip of the tongue . Today not even 5% of Telugu teachers can read a poem with intonation.

All vernaculars are like that.

  

अच् and हल् - are taken from Panini but not as / the Pratyaharas .

  

कळु / गळु - are used for बहुवचनम् in Tamil and Kannada and in Telugu only लु ramained  
  
In Telugu also there is त्रिमुनि व्याकरणम् -- all the three works are in Sanskrit --  
  
The first Vyakaranam in Telugu was penned in by Nannaya / Nannaparya in 11 AD along with first ever translation of Mahabharatam (some parts only) - आन्ध्रशब्दचिन्तामणि is compiled on the lines of Panini  
  
There are अथर्वणकारिकाः by Atharvanacarya that are akin to वार्तिकानि ।

  

अहोबलपति compiled अहोबलपण्डितीयम् on the lines of महाभाष्यम् -- the only difference is that the former runs like a commentary whereas the latter is like वाकोवाक्यम् ।

  

सन्धि - कारक - समास-तद्धित - कृत् - क्रिया etc. is just a copy of
Panini and it is clearly stated / quoted by authors .

  

In 19 th Century Cinnayasuri of Madras Chrisstian College authored the famous बालव्याकरणम् - one will find translations of the Sutras of Nannaya and Panini --

  

डुमुवुलवः प्रथमा (आन्ध्रशब्दचिन्तामणि) - डुमुवुलु प्रथम (बालव्या)

  

कर्मणि द्वितीया (पाणिनि) - कर्मंबुन द्वितीय यगु (बाल)

  

Even the concept of आर्य s is borrowed - आर्यव्यवहारंबुल दृष्टम्बु ग्राह्यंबु (बाल - संज्ञाप्र) , i.e. even if it is ग्राम्यम् one can accept.  
  
बहुजनपल्लि सीतारामय्य later built प्रौढव्याकरणम् with some modifications and additions -- महावाक्यम् ( प्रोक्ति in Hindi) etc. are discussed .

  

By and large , right from वर्ण down to महावाक्यम् , all aspects are discussed / defined in Telugu Grammatical works .

  

Without the knowledge of Panini one cannot teach Telugu Vyakaranam at a satisfactory level .

  

'लक्षणविरुद्धंबगु भाष ग्राम्यम्बु (बाल - संज्ञाप्रक.) .

  

तत्सम - तद्भव - देश्य - आच्छिक - ग्राम्य --- are the categories in Telugu . तत् = संस्कृतम् । आच्छिक is pure Telugu - अच्चतेलुगु (here च्च is दन्त्यम् )।

  

ग्राम्य is always prohibited --

  

'कन्ये कामयमानं मां न त्वं कामयसे कथम् ? ’ -- is an example of दण्डी in काव्यादर्श for ग्राम्योक्ति ( may be acid etc was not available to deface the girl who refused) .

  

Among the 11 Dravidian Languages 6 (?) do not have script . There are many books which compare the Langs .

  

क च ट त प - are परुषाः and ग ज ड द ब - are सरळाः - there will be replacement of the former by the latter .

  

  

धन्यो’स्मि
