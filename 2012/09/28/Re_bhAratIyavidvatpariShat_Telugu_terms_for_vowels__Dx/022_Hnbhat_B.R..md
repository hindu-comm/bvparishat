If one tries, all the Dravidian terms could be traced to Sanskrit by hooks or crooks or we have to accept as them native terms.

  

Linguists trace many Sanskrit terms to Tamil origin. पल्ली is listed in Sanskrit Lexicons, as in Amarakosha, "घोष आभीरपल्ली स्यात्" which means huts or group of huts, i.e. small village as noted by शाश्वत -"कुटिग्रामकयोः पल्लिः" as quoted by Bhanuji Dikshita in his commentary.

  

There is no wonder, even though common origin, may find used in different meanings entirely transferred or specialized to certain meaning borrowed either from Sanskrit or neighboring languages. Even polysemy words specialized to certain dialectal usages also could be found.
