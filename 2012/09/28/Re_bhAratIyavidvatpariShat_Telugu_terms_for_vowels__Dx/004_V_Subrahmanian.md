Namaste.  
  
I have been looking at the topic for quite a long time now. Once, by chance, I discovered the Tamil colloquial word 'kasmAlam' (it is a word to rebuke someone/something as useless/junk/absolutely devoid of any value) as having come from the Sanskrit word 'kashmalam'. In fact the word to denote 'grammar' in Tamil is 'ilakkaNam' which is nothing but the corrupt form of the Sanskrit 'lakShaNam'. In Kambaramayanam each section is named a 'paTalam' which is a Sanskrit word. The name 'tamizh' itself is, I think, a corrupt form of 'DramiDa'/'draviDa.
'Tol-kAppiam' has the word 'kAvyaH' in the name itself.  In fact the five mahAkAvya-s of ancient Tamil: 'silappadikAram', jIvaka-chintAmaNi, vaLayApati, kunDalakesi and maNimekalai - all contain easily recognizable Sanskrit words.  
  
The name 'veShTi' for dhoti is from the Sanskrit 'veShTanam'. A student is called 'mANavan'. A sari is called 'chelai' (chelam of sanskrit).
