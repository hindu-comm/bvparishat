Sir,  
  
I think here 'vaari' is actually ShaShThI like there is one 'kammavAri sangha' in Bangalore which is an 'association OF kamma (naidu-s). So the prathamA is 'vaaru'. It is 'guruvuluvAru'. In Kannada also they use: ...mahAswAmigaLavaru where the rule 'adhikasya adhikam phalm' seems to be applied.
