Dear Sh. Nityanand Misra,

Telugu, Kannada and Malayalam have all vowels and consonants that Sanskrit have and moreover short vowels for ए and ओ too (but Sanskrit एचामपि द्वादश, तेषां ह्रस्वाभावात्). But Tamil does not have ऋ ऌ etc. Tamil Consonants: first and fifth group letters are well there. A few more which are not in Sanskrit. No ac and hal concept is applicable in Tamil, but there are all ac and hal in the rest of three languages. In Malayalam also അച്ചുകള്‍ (accukal) and ഹല്ലുകള്‍ (hallukal) are used on the basis of Sivasutra pratyahara sutras. All Sanskrit syllables plus a few from Tamil are also there in Malayalam.

In Tamil it is not possible to have an ac hal system like Sivasutra pratyahara sutras. Please see:

Regards,

Narayanan
