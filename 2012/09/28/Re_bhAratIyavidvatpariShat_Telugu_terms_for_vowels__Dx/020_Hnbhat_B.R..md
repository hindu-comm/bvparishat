It is very natural that natural bordering regions of different language speakers to have give and take from each other even though they be borrowed in common from Sanskrit, either via Prakrit or directly तत्सम or तद्भव. The same applies to grammar patterns also to be influenced by the bordering languages, in addition to the dialectal difference.

  

There is no obsession between the speakers in this matter like the growing language according to the needs of the time. Tamil has the oldest of literature of the Dravidian Languages or द्राविडभाषा. While we are discussing the point in English for our convenience, we can accept the habit of English also accepting both Yogi and ascetic as English words equally without any discrimination Dravidian or Dravida languages both as English. Anyway we are not using Sanskrit itself even though we are discussing the influence of it over other languages for our convenience of expressing freely our feelings or opinions.
