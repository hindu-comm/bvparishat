hariH OM,  
pariShade namaH,  
  
"Well the terms Dravid/Dravidian are not exclusive to linguistics, but have many meanings depending on context. Dravid/Dravidian are indeed used geographically to refer to South India/South Indian (excluding Gujarat and Maharashtra) - the most famous use being in our national anthem by Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore which refers to South India as দ্রাবিড় (द्राविड़) "  
 rabindranath's usage of "drAviDa" is alluding to geography as given in our scriptures, but the question which was asked was this:

  
"Are these terms or similar terms used in other Dravidian languages as well? "  

 This is a linguistic-specific question and in the absence of any disclaimers, clarifications, the prasiddha terms are accepted. The context is lingustic and crystal-clearly so. There cannot be any confusions about contexts here. A similar confusion may occur when a doctor asks a patient to infuse insulin using a "pen" and the patient pierces his arm with a ball point pen and sprinkles insulin powder!!! Or when a person was asked to visit vishveshvara's temple at kAshi but instead goes to rAma temple in AyodhyA (thinking the word to be vishveshvara = rAma, kAshI = one which shines = ayodhyA, a similar line of argument was used recently to assert sha\~Nkara = rAmabhadra).  
 I am amazed that the questioner doesn't realize or refuses to realize that the question is loaded. Let us try to dissect it for our own benefit. This question is like the question asked by a prosecution lawyer to the accused, "have you confessed to the judge that you have committed murder? answer in 'yes' or 'no'" or some question on similar lines. Here, the question is whether certain terms have been used in "Dravidian languages" without any clarification as to whether it means the colonial classification (Aryan = languages spoken by those who conquered India and Dravidian = languages spoken by those who were conquered by the former) or the geographical classification (northern India, southern India). Any person who knows the "prasiddhi" of the colonial classification will know that this ("Dravidian language") is a loaded term. Answer to the question will accept the loadedness of the term. If the questioner were specific about geographical southern languages, he would have said "southern Indian languages".  
 One doesn't understand the need for so many intellectual gymnastics and call to authority (given in bA\~Ngla script!!!). A humbler, straight-forward and easier approach will be to accept that it is a loaded term and it was used innocently and move on with life. The classification of languages as "Aryan" and "Dravidian" has nothing to do with geography regardless of what rabindranath tagore says. as explained earlier, Sanskrit and German, both are Indo-Aryan languages, kannaDa and some afghanistani languages are "Dravidian" what is the geographical sAmya between them? (one can quote a higher authority and say vasudhaiva kuTumbakam!!! and then bring about a sAmya between avadhi and language of martian critters) One will be interested in seeing people use the term jap or negro and get away with it in popular discourse in the west (or even worse, justify it with a call to authority). So much of finickiness about the usage, authenticity, citation, attribution, precision in geographical location etc. of others, while relative nonchalance / fake innocence about one's own? One doesn't get the smell of a healthy debate here, or worse, one gets the smell of a bad debate.  
  
"Thanks for pointing out the difference between direct imperative and the causative imperative which I was unaware of. I would be obliged if you can tell me the causative versions for *samparkisi*, *upayogisi*, et cetera."  
 there will be no single word usage here. upayogisuvante mADu (make him use), samparkisuvante mADu (make him contact / communicate).

  
  
svasti,  
 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,
