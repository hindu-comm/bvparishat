Actually there is another object denoted by the word 'palli' (not paLLI), the common domestic lizard which is called 'halli' in Kannada.
One can add many more instances for the 'pa ha' shift across these languages: 'panRi' in Tamil is pig and it is 'handi' in Kannada, 'panni' in Malayalam. 'pon' is gold and 'honnu' is the name in Kannada. 'parundu' is a kite (bird) which is 'haddu' in Kannada.
'periya' in Tamil is to note something big and it is 'hiriya' in Kannada. 'pazhaiya' is old in Tamil and it is 'haLeyadu' in Kannada, 'pAtadi' in Telugu. So we can strike a lot of such common features across the southern languages.  
  
The Malayalam 'cheTTan' for elder brother and 'anujan' for younger brother are the Sanskrit 'jyeShTha' and 'anuja'.  The Sanskrit 'pArthiva' for King is having a Tamil 'pArthiban' (the famous novel of Kalki 'pArthiban kanavu').
