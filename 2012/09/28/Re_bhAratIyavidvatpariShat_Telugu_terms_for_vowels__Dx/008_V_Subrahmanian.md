There appears to be an exception in Kannada (and Tamil): the word 'ಮಕ್ಕಳು’ for instance has no ಗಳು; it is only 'kaLu'. In Tamil it is a little peculiar: in words like 'avargaL', 'paDigaL' (steps), there is a 'gaL'. But in other words like 'makkaL', 'kaRkaL' (stones) there is 'kaL'. I think it goes with the pronunciation. It would be rather difficult to pronounce 'kaRgaL' and 'makgaL'.  
  
I noticed, as Shrivatsa did, your word '’ನೋಡಿಸಿ’. It should be either 'ನೊಡಿ’ or 'ನೊಡಿರಿ’. 'ಪರೀಕ್ಷಿಸಿ’ (you - plural - examine) is another example. ಪ್ರಶ್ನಿಸಿ (you - plural - question).
