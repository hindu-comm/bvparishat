hariH OM,  
namaH pariShade,  
  
"If you have problems or get offended with the phrase "Dravidian languages", then I cannot help."  
  
 Any right thinking and self respecting Indian should be offended by the usage of the terminology "Dravidian" languages. Recently we saw a person calling for a public apology from others for having called him by a shortened version of his name. He seems not to be offended by a wrong classification of languages which was designed to make a North-South divide, Aryan-Dravidian divide, Brahmin-Anti Brahmin divide etc. We are amazed at the intellectual dishonesty.  
  
"Dr. Bhat has used the phrase and so has Dr. Korada and they do not seem to have a problem. You may publish your theses and propose a new nomenclature along with taxonomy and push for ISO standardization of the same. Once that happens, I will consider using the new terminology."  
 Again a call to two authorities. The two authorities are great and humble people and don't pick at others for being geographically imprecise (amongst other stifling requirements as imposed by the precision mongers), whereas the one calling upon their authority is. And if convinced about the issue, they (korada garu and bhat sir) will be graceful enough to not use loaded terms.  
  
 I needn't make any new nomenclature or taxonomy, it has already been made by the colonialists. This again is a deviation. The prasiddhi of these terms as colonial terms stays. The debater seems to be hell bent on using colonial terms. May the Parishat decide. We (those against colonial classification of languages as designed to divide India) rest our case here.
