Dear Sh. Nityanand Misra,  
உயிர் எழுத்து (uyir eḻuttu) and உயிர்மெய் எழுத்து (uyirmey eḻuttu) are the singular forms. The Plural forms are உயிர் எழுத்துகள் (uyir eḻuttukaḷ) and உயிர்மெய் எழுத்துகள் (uyirmey eḻuttukaḷ). The Bāṅlā স্বরবর্ণ (ṣoroborṇo) is quite O.K. But the Asamiya (horoborṇo?) স্বৰবৰ্ণ (svarabaṇar) is appearing wrongly. When you combine the Asamiya ৰ্ and ণ it appears ণ followed by ৰ্ is due to the Unicode character problem. So, the Bāṅlā সংযুক্ত (the conjunct-ṣoñjukto) is appearing র্ণ
( র্ + ণ ) in correct form whereas the Asamiya (Ohomiyo??) (ṇar) ৰ্ণ ( ণ + ৰ্ instead of ৰ্ + ণ ) is appearing in place of (rṇa) র্ণ. I think there is not much of change in Tirutākṣarī ( for the Maithilī ), Bāṅlā and Asamiya. The difference is there between Bāṅlā "ra" ( র ) and Asamiya "ra" ( ৰ ). Similarly, the Kannada "ka" ( ಕ ) is appearing differently from the Telugu "ka" (క ).  
Regards,  
Narayanan
