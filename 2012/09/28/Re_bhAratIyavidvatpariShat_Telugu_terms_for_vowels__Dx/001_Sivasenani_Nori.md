Yes, they are the standard terms. డు, ము, వు, లు (Du, mu, vu, lu) are the prathamaa vibhakti pratyayas in Telugu, which when attached to అచ్ (ach) and హల్ (hal) result in అచ్చులు (acchulu) and హల్లులు (hallulu).



If one has seen the Praakrit grammar of Vararuchi, what is striking is that the language described is Prakrit(s), but the language used to describe is Sanskrit. A somewhat similar situation obtains in Telugu; thegrammar (బాలవ్యాకరణము, baalavyaakaraNamu)is actually in Telugu, but the influence of Sanskrit isvery strongwith words like తుమునర్థకము (tumunarthakamu), క్త్వాంతములు (ktvaantamul) etc. being used.Almost all scholarly books I have seen speak of Telugu as a Dravidian language, but as a native speaker, I see that 90% of the words are derived from Sanskrit roots - now I do not understand the nomological status of a science (Linguistics) which classifies languages like this. Rajeev Malhotra's "Breaking India" seems to offer a reason: the Aryan-Dravidian divide was engineered by the Imperialists as part of the 'Divide and rule strategy'. It is not merely the experience with language; as per traditional reckoning Maharashtrians are amongst the panchadraaviDas (example: consider the eminent cricketer, Rahul Dravid, a Maharashtrian whose family name itself is Dravid) and Guajratis amongst the daSadraaviDas. There are many similarities between Marathi and Telugu, but the one is an Indo-Aryan language and the other, a Dravidian language. Meanwhile, most of the classical Telugu poets (who have written prabandhas etc.) till the seventeenth century (in fact, many even in twentieth century, like Viswanatha Satyanarayana who had characters called haahaa and hUhU speak in Prakrit in one of his historic novels) knew Telugu, Sanskrit and eight Prakrits. Sanskrit was not merely a necessary language to know; many poems would also count as poems in Sanskrit. For instance, in the Daasarathi Satakam of Kancherla Gopanna (Bhakta Ramadas), the first six poems, all using only sambodhana-prathamaa-vibhakti, would count as Sanskrit poems as well. Then, there is this saying about Telugu poets (like Srinatha) writing in Sanskrit, with Du, mu, vu, lu (i.e Telugu vibhakti pratyayas) attached to claim them as Telugu poems. All the vrittas of Sanskrit are used to compose poems in Telugu as well, sometimeswith additional yati and praasa niyamas. (There are also Telugumeters, not to be found in Sanskrit, but the Sanskrit vrittas are very common, maybe more than half in the major kaavyas). When it comes to poetics or alankaara Saastra, KaavyprakaaSa remains the most popular. After all, most examples of sambhoga Sringaarain AlankaaraSaastra are in Maahaaraashtri or Sauraseni - so it is no wonder thatthe tenets of the Saastra apply in all languages, or that Indian languages use the work for the evaluation of their own poetic works. Recently I was reading the evaluation of YenkipaaTalu, which is written in a dialect of Telugu, which stands in the same relation to 'standard' Telugu, as would Sauraseni to Sanskrit, (in Telugu there are two types of words - prakriti and vikriti; say, katha and kata; though the vikriti words are Telugu only,they are typically used for non-learned characters and the derivation of these words clearly requires more steps, sometimes using the rules of Vararuchi's Prakrit grammar itself) based totally on theDhvanyaaloka framework. In short, one cannot view literary Telugu separately from Sanskrit \[1\].



Yet, a mere hundred years later, in early nineteenth century, we have this new family of Dravidian languages - which by way of repetition over 150 years culminates in educated North Indians(with more than a fair exposure to South India, enough to be able to read South Indian scripts)to be surprised at the amount of Sanskrit to be found in these 'Dravidian' languages! I thinkthe way linguistics is taught in India needs to be changed and the pointneeds to be made thatthe so-called Dravidian languages indeed havemany common Dravidian roots like kai (hand), butthat Telugu, Kannada andMalayalam are much closer to Sanskrit than isgenerally believed now; surely less closerthan Marathi and Gujarati, but not by a long way. This is not merely a more factually correct position, but it has ramifications in terms of the self-impression thatour countrymen have of our country. That apart, books on linguistics in Indian languages need to be updated. The book of Kapildev Dwivedi on Bhaasha Saastra (in Hindi)is an excellent introduction but quite dated with all the new developments in linguistics. At least these kind of books should bring out the close affinity between the major South Indian languages and Sanskrit.

\[1\] There are kaavyas like Yayaaticharitrawritten in jaanutenugu, or pure Telugu without using words derived from Sanskrit roots, but these are a small subset of Telugu literature (I know of 3 or so jaanutenugu kaavyas, compared to about50-60 standard Telugu kaavyas) and most people would require koSas to understand them.
