hariH OM,  
pariShade namaH,

  
  
"Except for Tamil, Telugu and Malyalam, terms in all other languages above come from Samsrkita स्वर and व्यञ्जन"  

 The terminology used by tamizh is much more in line with shikShA granthas. "uyir" means "life". The ones having life are svaras. Calling a svara as having "life" is much closer to the definition of svara in shikShA, than merely calling it "ach" ("ach" is a technical terminology used by pANinii, outside aShTAdhyAyii it has no independent existence).  
 The tamil terminology for vya\~njana just corroborates this.

  
  
  
"Some are used liberally in administrative terminology like ಇಲಾಖೆ (*ilakhe*, meaning "area"), ಕಚೇರಿ (*kaceri*, meaning "office"), ವಕೀಲರು (*vakīlaru*, meaning "lawyer"), et cetera."  

 Administrative terms became persianized during the time of the fanatic tipu sultan in the old mysore region and during the reign of nizams in the hyderabad karnataka region.

  
  
  
"Regarding Indo-Aryan/Dravidian language taxonomy, I used the term "Dravidian languages" only in the geographical sense to refer to southern languages. I do not have any strong views for or against the currently accepted taxonomy, though I do want to say "heavily influenced by Sanskrit" may not the same as "derived from Sanskrit" or "belonging to the same family as Sanskrit". "  

 One is amused at these quibbles (heavily influenced is not same as derived from!). Moreover, one uses loaded terms (terms used by colonialists to divide India on linguistic and caste lines) and then says that these are merely "geographical". These aren't geographical terms. If that were so, some languages of Pakistan and Afghanistan wouldn't have been classified as "dravidian".  
 If one removes samskR^itam words from kannaDa (there are many such enthusiasts who draw their inspiration from the anti-national movements which were led by Ramasami Naicker and were quite successful in tamizhnADu), there is no soul left in it.  
 The great enthusiasm to call some languages as "belonging to a family" and others otherwise is again falling to a colonial trap! At any rate, even if one takes this childish "family" construct seriously, one can safely say that samskR^itam is closer to kannaDa than german.

  
  
  
"The ubiquitous advertisement hoardings in Bangalore have highly Samskritised usages like ಸಂಪರ್ಕಿಸಿ (*samparkisi*, meaning "\[you\] contact") and ಉಪಯೋಗಿಸಿ (*upayogisi*, meaning "\[you\] use"), while advertisements for TV soaps on Kannada channels use forms like ವೀಕ್ಷಿಸಿ (*vīkṣisi*, meaning "\[you\] see") instead of the more common ನೋಡಿಸಿ (*noḍisi*)."  

 " ನೋಡಿಸಿ" Why would someone use this? "ನೋಡಿಸಿ" does not mean "you see", it means "make someone see". "ನೋಡಿ" has the meaning of "you see" which is widely used and more common than "ನೋಡಿಸಿ". (We forgive the non-native for having tripped here and don't exhort him to "when in doubt google it" and also not harangue him on getting this fact wrong).  
  
  
svasti,  
 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,  
 shrivathsa.
