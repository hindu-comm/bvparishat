As we delve deeper into the topic more instances are coming into the limelight. While taking bold to say that these suffixes are cognate, I would also like to point out certain peculiar usages like, for instance, when the word 'magaLir' is used, to mean, in plural, women. magaL is a daughter and to indicate the generality of womenfolk this word magaLir is used. Here we see a strange suffix used 'ir'. I have seen another similar usage: 'penDir' to mean the same: womenfolk, the word 'peN' is a girl/woman and the plural referring to the woman jAti is penDir.

Yes. In other languages like Kannada, 'swamigaLu' and Telugu 'svAmulu and an optional 'vAru' to add even more respect.  
  
I am often amused over a very special feature in Telugu: a number of words come in default plural as if to indicate the very jAti. For example: godumulu (wheat), miryAlu (pepper/chilli), poovulu (flower),
yeNTikalu (hair), aTTakulu (flattened rice), etc. There may be some spelling mistakes here but I have observed Telugu people using plural very freely. In Tamil and Kannada I see these names being used in singular: godhumaii/godhi, miLagu/meNasu, poo/hoovu, talai muDi/koodalu, aval/avalakki, etc.
