hariH OM,  
namaH pariShade,

  
  
""Dravidian languages" followed by "Dākṣiṇātya scholars" makes the context clear."  

 one more somersault. Why not "dAkShiNAtya bhAShA"s or "southern languages"? But then, we have stopped expecting precision from the precision mongers! All the precision mongers' mails come with riders, clauses, sub clauses and sub sub clauses similar to what we find on insurance policies! finally the clauses etc. are meant to protect the one proposing them, not the ones who propose to take them. :-)

  
  
" You can choose to ignore it and continue writing theses which add no value to the discussion. That is not my problem. "  

 No, one hasn't ignored it, one has noted it as another intellectual somersault in a series of intellectual-gymanastic-phantasmagoria. Noting these (fallacies, intellectual somersaults etc.) have added great value to us inasmuch as it has added to our knowledge base of "how fallacies are used as arguments". Fallacies used against others cause no "problem" to the perpetrator, but are quite tortuous on the victims (certain bodily emissions are known to do the same). Theses are necessitated by anR^iju atmosphere of discussion and debate. They (the theses) also clarify to the pariShat that one isn't over-reacting nor nit-picking.

  
  
"Is not the person different here? Second person versus third person?"  

 A clarification with examples may help.  
Clarification: upayogisuvante mADu = this is the verb: to make me / him / someone use. (happens to be the loT, madhyama puruSha form also).  
Examples:  
prathama puruSha: avanu "niti"yannu oLLeya tarka upayogisuvante mADuttAne = he makes "niti" use good logic. (in other words, prevent "niti" from using fallacies).  
i.e. upayogisuvante mADuttAne = he makes him use.  
madhyama puruSha: niinu "niti"yannu oLLeya tarka upayogisuvante mADuttiiye: you make "niti" use good logic  
i.e. upayogisuvante mADuttiiye = you make him use.  
uttama puruSha: nAnu "niti"yannu oLLeya tarka upayogisuvante mADuvenu = i will make "niti" use good logic.  
i.e. upayogisuvante mADuvenu = I make him use.  
  
In the easier forms (non-two-word-verb forms)  
prathama: avanu tanna maneyannu tOrisuttAne = he showed (him / her) the home. and the like.

  
  
svasti,  
 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,  

shrivathsa.
