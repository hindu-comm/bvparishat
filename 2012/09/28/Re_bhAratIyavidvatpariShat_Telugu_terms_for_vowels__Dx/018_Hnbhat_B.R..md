Thanks for the authentic assertions from Prof. Korada.

  

By the way, अच्च is commonly used for Kannada also, अच्चकन्नड, which was a movement in Kannada literature, managing with तद्भव and देश्य words called देसि normally against the influence of over Sanskritization.
ಕಬ್ಬಿಗರ ಕಾವ of Andayya, seems to be the first of product of the movement and latest ರಾಮಾಶ್ವಮೆಧ of end of 18th century by Muddana alias Lakshminarayana who started his career as a physical teacher, but gained a name in Kannada Litrature.  
  
On the other side, Rudrabhatta's ಜಗನ್ನಾಥವಿಜಯ has verses in highly Sanskritized Kannada, and the first benedictory verse itself in quite unintelligible without a commentary. Jain writers contributed a large part in the early and middle part of the history of Kannada Literature, and of whom one wrote a ಕರ್ನಾಟಕ ಶಬ್ದಾನುಶಾಸನಮ್ completely in Sanskrit, but examples from different texts or himself provided as compared to the standardized grammar in versified form of Keshiraja which is called ಶಬ್ದಮಣಿದರ್ಪಣ considered as more authentic than the other later one ಶಬ್ದಾನುಶಾಸನ कर्णाटकशब्दानुशासन of Bhattakalanka.  
Earlier to him, Karnataka Bhasha Bhushana, Nagavarma II's grammatical model is based on the Katantra school of Sanskrit grammar and the author styles himself Abhinava Sarvavarma ("Modern Sarvavarma"), Sarvavarma being a noted Sanskrit grammarian to a Satavahana king. This shows the influence of Sanskrit Grammar and Language over Kannada. Bhattakalanka's

Shabdanushasana is much more comprehensive in its scope.  
  
  
Caldwel's Comparative Grammar of Dravidian Languages provide a comprehensive and comparative study of the grammars, both spoken and written main Dravidian Languages.

  

Linguists differ in the analysis of the प्रत्यय-s of case-endings, as earlier grammarians followed the model of Paninian grammar and offer certainly different opinions. Emen Burrow's Dictionary of Dravidian Languages is being revised yet finding sources to Sanskrit vocabulary. I think by now the revision should be completed.
