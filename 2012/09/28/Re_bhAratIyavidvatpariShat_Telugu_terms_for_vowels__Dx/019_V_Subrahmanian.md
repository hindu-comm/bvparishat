This is very true. In old Kannada which is identified as 'haLagannaDa' one would find a striking similarity to Tamizh. Especially the 'gaL' profusely used. Words like 'piDidu' (Tamil 'piDitthu'), 'pogu' (instead of 'hogu' and the Tamizh 'pogu') can be seen in Purandara Dasa's works.
'peLidAn..' ('he said') instead of the modern 'heLidanu' is another example of how 'ha' was 'pa' in the olden literature. Even 'pAlu' (milk) in old Kannada is an instance of similarity with Tamil/Telugu.
The modern word is, however, 'hAlu'. 'PeNNu' ('heNNu') to denote a woman, the same as 'peNN' of Tamil. One can see such usages in the Kannada KumAravyAsa's 'BhArata'.
