Dear Dr. Narayanan  
  
Thanks a lot for pointing out the singular and plural forms - I have made the corrections. The Bengali and Assamese are in Unicode Vrinda font - I suspect the font does not display uniformly or correctly on some platforms, which may be the reason why *bôrno *appears differently for you in the two scripts and same for me. **  
  
It appears that the plural suffix ಗಳು in Kannada is cognate with the strikingly similar plural suffixes കള്‍ and கள் in Malyalam and Tamil respectively, the sounds ga (ग) and ka (क) being both velars (कण्ठ्य). It would be great if somebody can confirm this.  
  
Best regards, Nityanand
