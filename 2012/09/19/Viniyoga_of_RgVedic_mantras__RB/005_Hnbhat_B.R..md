Very simple answer is that each have individual AnukramaNi-s and also a सर्वानुक्रमणी - a combined index of ऋषि, छन्दस् and देवता, - separately, and combined one as सर्वानुक्रमणी of शौनक available today:

  

<http://hi.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E0%A4%B8%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B5%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%A8%E0%A5%81%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%A3%E0%A5%80>

  

which commentators use in their commentators for our facility. There is not any necessity of only one छन्दस्, or देवता or ऋषि for each सूक्त compilation, each could be shared by different ones within the सूक्त for मन्त्र-s inside or a common देवता for the सूक्त and inside मन्त्र-s devoted to other deities also. Some have one one ऋषि or देवता also throughout the सूक्त.

  

More can be expected from those experts in the field.
