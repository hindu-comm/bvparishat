Dear Scholar,

Theoretically all the mantras are employed. But many of them are found only in the Prātaranuvāka and Āśvinaśastra. *utsannyajñamantras* too are referred to in post-Rgvedic literature.

The above is the Mīmāṃsā point of view which is not contested by Āstikas. But many modern scholars like Kaegi do not admit that all the mantras were meant for viniyoga. The Prātaranuvākanyāya by which mantras without explicit mention of viniyoga in the Brāhmaṇas can be stuffed into the Prātaranuvākas is post-Vedic. Those mantras might not have been sacrificially employed originally.

But in fact every mantra is employed in karman with or without any relevant vidhi. This is so because recitation that is plain prayer too is a karman. Svādhyāya is such a karman. Brahmayajña too is so. Every mantra can be used in these prayers. That also is authentic viniyoga

Best
