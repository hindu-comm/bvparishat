\<Can some help me understand why "viniyoga" is not given along with "R^iShi", :"Chhanda", and "devataa" for individual suuktaa's.>

The question is where should they be given? The post-Vedic commentaries like those of Sāyaṇa do give them but that is not the authentic source. The authentic sources are various and separate for different categories of requirements.

For viniyoga it is the Brāhmaṇas

1. For devatā, ṛṣi and mtere the sources are always laukika

2. For the Atharvaveda (Śaunakīya) the Bṛhatsarvānukramaṇikā and Pañcapaṭalikā are two sources of metre and hymn name. Its viniyoga is available in the laukika Kauśikasūtra.

3. The relevant ancillary literature of the Paippalāda-Saṃhitā have not yet been published

4. Best
