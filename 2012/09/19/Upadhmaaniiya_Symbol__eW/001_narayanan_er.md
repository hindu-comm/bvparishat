Sir,

The symbol is available in Unicode Common symbols, not in the list of the Devanagari, but in the list of Common. It is common for the Upadhmaaniiya and the Jihvaamooliiya. For instance: 8-3-37 कुप्वोः ≍क≍पौ च। The symbols pre-posed to ≍क and ≍प are the Jihvaamooliiya and the Upadhmaaniiya respectively. You can apply this MSWord, Power-Point, Notepad and Excel in the Windows but not necessarily in the PageMaker, as the PageMaker (5, 6.5 and 7 etc.) is not a Unicode character friendly, and they are all outdated softwares. Nowadays, we have numerous versions of Linux such as Ubuntu and Fedora. From Windows XP to Windows 7 support Unicode Characters. Installing TrueType Fonts and AdobeTypeManager Fonts (those are only got installed through ATM, through compact discs, but not through 3¼ Floppy) with the Windows 98 is a Twentieth Century exercise which is more often limited to the particular Desktop PC or the Laptop PC and nothing uniqueness in them.  

Regards,

Narayanan
