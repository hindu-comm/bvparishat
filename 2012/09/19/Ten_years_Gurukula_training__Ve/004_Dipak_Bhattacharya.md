Fine! Dr. Narayanan’s reply is well meant but the printing आब्धर्लङ्घित does not show the actual reading अब्धिर्लङ्घित। Again, while one admits the efficacy of deep learning suggestively praised by Murāri, the majority of Sanskrit scholars do not have a ten year Gurukula training. There are many ways of going deep. Many of the non-Gurukula scholars are acclaimed authorities and it is their voice that is heard. One may like it or not but it will be just keeping one’s eyes shut out from reality not to see that the best days of traditional training belong to an unretrievable past.

To do away with misunderstanding I should state that before and after leaving the University, I did have decades of traditional training that is in my blood. I stated the hard reality without malice.

Best
