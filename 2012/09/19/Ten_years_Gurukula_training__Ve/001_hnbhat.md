Dear Joshi,

  

Please note that the above remark depends on the objective of the study. Within ten minutes, one can search the internet sources for the required word, without waiting for the 10 years to complete the study as remarked by by Prof. Korada and write up a 100 pages article with the information easily within a short time. One can go through the searchable database or document of Bloomfields Vedic Concordance and find any quotation from the wide range of sources he had consulted and recorded. One can get to the resources available and make up his knowledge with the tools for learning with the sources available online or offline, like Monier Williams' dictionary and so on.

  

In Gurukula system, such facility was not available and all the things what we achieve by looking up in Vedic Concordance or A Vedic Grammatical Word Index is achieved by learning the sources available for them, the different Darshana's, and Shastra's learnt in the system, so that they become themselves, walking encyclopeadia-s literally as we can see in the person of Prof. Korada.

  

This is the difference I can guess between the two systems followed.

  

In addition, I can add the resource Upanishad Concordance of A Jacob which collects important sentences of Upanishad literature like that of Bloomfield from Vedic Literature. There are already available translations in different languages also for Veda-s and related Literature, mainly in the series of Sacred Literature, in English. One can have easy access to such sources, without waiting for 10 years.

  

The other facility available, is the reinforced text in their mind, by learning Veda-s, by eight Vikriti-paatha-s, so that a ready Concordance is available always in their mind for the Samhita texts they have learnt and need not look up into Vedic concordance for any reference.

  

Choice is yours to consider the comparative advantages and disadvantages if any in both the systems and select one.

  

With regards
