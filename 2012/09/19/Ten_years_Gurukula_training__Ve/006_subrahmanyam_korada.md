नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

Dear Prof Joshi

  

I did not mean to offend anybody nor did I contemplate to scuttle the ongoing research / study in Sanskrit -

  

when a scholar , without going into the texts remarked , put on web some highly misleading statement regarding a thing like पुनर्जन्म then in that context , that too for Veda and allied subjects I said 10 years Gurukula -- ' objective of the study' .

  

Wherever पुण्य and पाप are discussed there is पुनर्जन्म - गान्धर्ववेद - संगीतरत्नाकर (स्वराध्याय) is an example .

  

The Scholar who wants to know the veracity of the statement seems to be quite young .

  

It was a Seminar on Patanjalayoga in a South Indian Uni. - at least five faculty members presented Papers (UGC says there are marks for this) - one candidate said - there will be 'spiritual health' from Yoga - I asked what does it mean - 'it is there on Internet' ! I don't know
Others too said something what is not the exact theory of Patanjali .

  

All did cut and paste from Internet .

  

In a Seminar in a Uni in Western India  - a senior faculty read - there are धातुs called वात , पित्त and कफ !

  

The question is whether to attend a Seminar or not . I declined to go to Russia and America .

  

Please do not compare your आसक्ति with that of the young generation . 90% of students do not want to approach any Guru and learn .

  

The members of BVP who are not originally Sanskrit Students but are very interested in different Sastras are far better .

  

There should be some way , may be suggested by Dr Ramanujam , to keep alive the Gurukula type of teaching .

  

I was to perform संध्यावन्दनम् , अग्निकार्यम्  and rush for वेदाध्ययनम् in the morning followed by व्याकरणम् and ज्योतिषम् in the afternoon and evening - cooking the food on my own .

  

There were Gurus of Sastras who do not teach if the student is in pants .

  

As late as 2008 I was going to a Second Guru for Vedanta .

  

I started conducting Workshop on Vedangas and Darsanas - this year after fixing everything , Central Institute of Indian Languages , Mysore is not in a position to grant due to internal problems - last year it did. I am searching elsewhere .

  

I want to see that every student / teacher is equipped with the background of all Vedangas and Darsanas (Veda and Alamkara).

  

Although I am working in Center for Applied Linguistics and Translation Studies , and did / doing Translation , I suggest strong base in Sastras in Gurukula .

  

आत्मा बुध्या समेत्यार्थान् मनो युङ्ते विवक्षया (पाणिनीयशिक्षा) --

  

Allen translated आत्मा as Soul ( Phonetics in Ancient India) - it is अन्तरङ्गम् ।

  

Humboldt (On Language) also says - Soul.

  

Let us not take up Stoics , Plato and Aristotle - who might have meant आत्मा for Soul - it was not a Translation .

  

A Vedic scholar who did not Study in Gurukula said in a Seminar here - आत्मा combines with बुद्धि ।

  

The situation is alarming and these people are there to decide .

  

Others may also have very bad experiences .

  

It is simply nauseating .

  

Let us support every Student / Scholar of Sanskrit .

  

धन्यो’स्मि
