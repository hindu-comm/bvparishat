Sir,

Both are correct.  

1. In the first the acyutahood, the anantahood and the govindahood are ascribed to a single person, which formed to be a karmadhaaraya compound of a tatpurusa category, as the rule says: tatpurusah samaanaadhikaranah karmadhaarayah. Here, the meaning is: salutation to him who is indestructible, endless and the lord of the earth.  

2. In the second, acyuta, ananta and govinda could be three people, so it comes a dvandva, as an equal salutation deserved by all these three, as dvanda keeps its all elements equal. So, here the meaning is: salutation to Mr. Acyuta, Mr. Ananta and Mr. Govinda as well.

Regards,

Narayanan
