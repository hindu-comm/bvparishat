Respected Professor Aklujkar,

I fully agree with your views. That person really deserves encouragement, as he takes all the replies he received positively, in his back up messages in this forum. My reply also was for the correction regarding gender which is obviously achieved through long practice of lexicons etc. Once if we are not receiving a good sound Sanskrit at least in writing, it will be difficult to convey the language and idiom to the next generation and that which our ancestors had contemplated. As we learn more and more by correcting ourselves, by eradicating mistakes committed in various times. I also felt that the gentleman will gradually improve upon while he is timely corrected, so long as the person takes all corrections positively, and it is good sign of his respect to the language too.  

Regards,

Narayanan
