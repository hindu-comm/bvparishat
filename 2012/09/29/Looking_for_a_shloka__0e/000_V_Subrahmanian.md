Namaste  
  
I heard that there is a shloka which starts with this word:
राशब्दोच्चारणेनैव... The meaning of the verse is: By opening the mouth to utter the name of 'राम’, all one's sins go out of oneself. And when the ucchAraNam is completed by uttering the 'ma', the sins that have gone out cannot re-enter as the mouth is closed (lips are joined for pronouncing 'ma'). Will anyone kindly give me the full verse?
