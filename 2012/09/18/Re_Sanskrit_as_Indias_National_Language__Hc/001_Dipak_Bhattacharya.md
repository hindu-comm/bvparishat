This was interesting. Could a scan of the clipping be made available? Against many I have respect for Ambedkar's virulent opposition to the stagnating condition concomitant with the medieval village panchayets. His support for Sanskrit as the national language must have been compatible with his general outlook. It must have been so but I like to know how. So because our Kalpasutras and medieval Brahminisn were on the whole anti-urban. See Ramgopal for the former literature. For the latter I admit the existence of the opposite outlook too. The most interesting thing is that ours is the land of the friendly coexistence varieties and contradictions.
