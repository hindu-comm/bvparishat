Dear Rajesh:



 Thank you for the note. I was not aware of Ambedkar's involvement in it. I believe Rajendra Prasad was influential in scuttling the idea of Sanskrit as national language.



 I am circulating your note with two groups of experts who might have more to say on this.



 On the OIT I feel that it lacks support and may only muddy the waters. My approach is to simply look at the evidence and examine their contributions without any labels like Aryans, Dravidians, etc. We need to get away from all such theories, which are really more conjectures than theories.



 I suggest you visitFOLKS Magazine at:<http://folks.co.in> where you will find several of my articles on these and related topics.



Sincere regards,

N.S. Rajaram
