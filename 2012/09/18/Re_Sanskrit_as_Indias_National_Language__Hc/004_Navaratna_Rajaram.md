Dear N.S. Rajaram ji, and others,

  

Here is some more information!

  

I looked up the ["Report of the Sanskrit Commission 1956-1957"](http://www.scribd.com/doc/106367408/Report-of-the-Sanskrit-Commission-1956-1957-Complete)! Couldn't find a good formatted document online, so did the formatting and correcting of some spelling and grammar mistakes myself, also added a ToC and uploaded it to scribd.

  

Here I reproduce [a part from the above report](http://www.scribd.com/doc/106367408/Report-of-the-Sanskrit-Commission-1956-1957-Complete#outer_page_133) (Page 133):

The majority > which decided such a vital issue was one of the narrowest. During the > few stormy days of the Constituent Assembly's discussion of this > question, the impasse was sought to be solved by some members by > proposing Sanskrit as the Rastrabhasa; and the late **Dr.B.R. > Ambedkar**, who as the Law Member, was piloting the bill, was also > reported to have favoured that proposal. In the course of the > discussion of this question in the Assembly, several members, > including some ardent protagonists of Hindi, paid due homage to > Sanskrit. Apart from all this, the onlyother Indian languages for the > adoption of which as the Rastra bhasa a regular amendment was moved, > and discussion on which took a good part of the time of the Assembly, > was Sanskrit. >

The late **Lakshmi Kanta > Maitra**, who moved the amendment seeking to replace Hindi by > Sanskrias the Official Languages, observed in the Assembly, that, if > Sanskrit was accepted, "all the jealousies, all this bitterness will > vanish with all the psychological complex that has been created > ............. there will not be the least feeling of domination or > suppression of this or that". Thus, neutrality (or notbeing the spoken > language of any section) has been urged as the first criterion of a > National Language.

The neutrality of > Sanskrit is not a mere negative quality; it is also the positive > virtue of having grown by incorporating into itself elements from all > other languages of the country.
