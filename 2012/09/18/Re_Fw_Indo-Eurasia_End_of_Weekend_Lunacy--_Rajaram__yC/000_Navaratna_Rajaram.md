*September 18, 2012*



** So Witzel is coming out of the woodwork-- seemingly recovered from the Subramanian Swamy fiasco of a year ago.



 My talk at Boston U yesterday went very well. My essage was-- forget labels like Aryan, Dravidian, etc and just look what the ancients have left behind in archaeology, literature and what science us in terms of natural history and genetics and build a new account disregarding old myths (like Aryan, Dravidian, etc) presented as 'theories'.



 This is the book that I am currently working on that I have called *The Genes of Time.* Witzel and his ilk are still stuck in the nineteenth century. Let them wallow in their discredited past.



 As far as my MIT talk (April 2010) he refers to he as usual misrepresents the facts. My comment on Vedanta and physics (which was not the topic but came up incidentally), was so terrible that MIT and University of Manchester and Indian Institute of Science later invited me to give full fledged talks on it, and OUP asked me for a book proposal! I have spoken on the subject at least half a dozen times in the two years hence worldwide.



 But why bother. Witzel and his cohorts are living in the dustbin of history but don't want to face the truth. So, let us just move forward.
