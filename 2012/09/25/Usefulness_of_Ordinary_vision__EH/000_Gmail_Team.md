Dear Dr. Nityananda Misra,



Thank you for letting us know that young British scholar deciphered Brahmi script with his ordinary vision. British scholars undertook archaeological excavations in India in 1928 and discovered Indus valley civilization. They looked inside the earth with their ordinary vision. Now we are racing to claim Indus civilization of ancient Vedic R's'is with Divya vision who saw mantras. Ordinary vision discovered 22000 written tablets in the Middle-East. There we find names of Indra, Nasatya etc. Now we are racing to prove that we went out of India to the Middle-East countries.



Justice Katju stressed rational thinking and use of ordinary vision. Rational thinking of Naiyayikas discovered Wave theory of sound (Dhvani). We are using all kinds of scientific gadgets invented by people of other countries. They used rational thinking and observations with ordinary vision. Many ancient Indian scientists used rational thinking and ordinary vision. But we get fever of Divya vision from time to time. When I was studying in F.Y. Science in India, Balashastri Haridas in his popular lectures on superiority of the ancient Indian culture criticized experimental science in laboratories. He was referring to Divya vision of ancient R's'is. We were so proud of our Divya vision at that time, others have only ordinary vision. Now I realize ordinary vision is useful too. Thanks.NR.Joshi N.R.Joshi
