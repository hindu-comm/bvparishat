As someone who earns my rice and rasam in a profession based on modern science, may I point out that what is called ordinary vision is actually not so ordinary after all? A James Prinsep takes birth once in a rare while, and Sri Misra is right,Indiancivilizationneeds to give him a place of honorfor vastly enhancingour knowledge of our own history. It requires someone with extraordinary ability to come up with the insight that changes everything in any field of knowledge or lays the foundation for a new one.

  
Best regards,

Vidyasankar
