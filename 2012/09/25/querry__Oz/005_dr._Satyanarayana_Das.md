His works were published by Krishnadas Baba from Vrindavan which are out of print. I have most of his works in my library and i published his Govind Bhasya with explanation by Pandit Andagopal in Bengali script. I plan to publish the english translation of his Vedanta Kaustubha soon. Some of his works are available at
