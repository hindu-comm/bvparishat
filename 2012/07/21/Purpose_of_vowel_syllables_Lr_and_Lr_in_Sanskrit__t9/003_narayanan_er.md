Respected scholars,

ऋ (short) , ॠ (long), ऌ (short), ॡ (prolongation lengthened to 3 maatras, called प्लुतः) are considered among vowels due to their shortening and lengthening qualities. No consonants are heard to be variant in their length of pronunciation. Those who follow the Kaushitakabrahmana of the Rgvada and when they do tarpana to their late ancestral parents, do chant:

स्वधा स्थ तर्पयत नः पितॄन्। As the Yajurvedins vary this as: स्वधा स्व तर्पयत मे पितॄन्। or स्वधा स्थ तर्पयत मे पितॄन्। etc.

Here पितॄन् in the accusative plural is ॠ (lengthened to 2 maatras, called दीर्घः) in masculine as well as मातॄः in feminine.   

The term होतॣकारः is exemplified as the vowel combination of ऋ and ॡ (prolongation lengthened to 3 maatras, called प्लुतः).

So, the extension of maatras (duration, length) is only possible on vowels. The svara variation too only for vowels. There is a possibility of half-short svara vowel too.  

The Paninian rules 1.2.27 to 1.2.32 clarify this. People who are increasingly interested in with the Western style of phonetics confuse naturally between ऋ and र, ऌ and ल etc. Here we have to feel the importance of the पाणिनीयशिक्षा etc. which honourably evaluate each syllable in terms of its length, accent and origin etc is non-ambiguous. The credibility of the Vedas are well preserved by this system. Patanjali says:

दुष्टः *शब्दः स्वरतो* वर्णतो वा मिथ्याप्रयुक्तो न तमर्थमाह। स वाग्वज्रो यजमानं हिनस्ति यथेन्द्रशत्रुः स्वरतोऽपरधात्॥  

Professor H N Bhat also quoted this with a bit of variance in the BVP last year on 26.08.2011:

मन्त्रो हीनः स्वरतो वर्णतो वा मिथ्याप्रयुक्तो न तमर्थमाह। स वाग्वज्रो यजमानं हिनस्ति यथेन्द्रशत्रुः स्वरतोऽपराधात्॥

If we translate अच् or स्वर as vowels then we have ऋ (short) , ॠ (long), ऌ (short), ॡ (prolongation lengthened to 3 maatras, called प्लुतः) are availably well heard. Or you have to define the vowel within the limited range of AEIOU, and then you can hardly cover the phonetic and linguistic purpose of even the Semitic languages too.  

Regards,

Narayanan
