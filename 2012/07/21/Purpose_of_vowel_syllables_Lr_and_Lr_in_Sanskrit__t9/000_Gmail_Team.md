Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



In Sanskrit alphabet we have two vowel syllables /Lr'/hrasva and other /Lr'\_/ dIrgha. There are not many words with these vowels. What was the purpose in including them? Were they present in Vaidika corpus? I read that the dirgha vowel is present in the language 'Ossetes' found in Caucasious Mountain area. I know two words Gamlr' and Kaplr'. If you know more, then please list them for me. Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
