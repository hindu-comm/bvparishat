**(१८) निर्वाति निर्वायति विध्यायत्युद्वायतीति च ॥ २१ ॥  
उद्वाति शाम्यतीत्येते तेजसो विरतौ तु षट् ।**  

  

The above line is from the आख्यातचन्द्रिका of भट्टमल्ल, a collection of synonymous verbs classified in different categories of the action denoted by the roots. The above are the six synonyms of निर्वाति - used to convey the meaning extinguishing of flight.  I could not guess the
roots of the verbs highlighted above. The first seems वि+ध्यै - चिन्तायाम् is the popularly used to think, meditate etc. without prefix. Is there any usage with the specific meaning, of निर्वाति - f.to be blown out or extinguished; विध्यायति, उद्वायति. MW gives for उद्वा also, but the form उद्वायति is doubtful. उद्+ (ओ)वै शोषणे - would give the form. With prefix, it may give the meaning of उद्+वा - गतीन्धनयोः, as given in the second which is explained as to be explained by MW. But वि+ध्यै is not found in the Dictionary, but the form is seen used in a Buddhist text in the translatin of a Prakrit text:

  

ऊसरदेसं दड्ढिल्लिल्लियं व विज्झाइ वणदवो पप्प =

ऊषरदेशं पूर्गमेवाग्निना दग्धं वा प्राप्य विध्यायति वनदवो दावानलः।

  

in श्रावकप्रशस्ति commentary.

  

I would like to know whether there is any other धातु in Paninian धातुपाठ or others that would precisely give the form with the meaning निर्वाति or any other usage in other Texts other than Buddhist Sanskrit from the same verb वि+ध्यै.

  

With regards
