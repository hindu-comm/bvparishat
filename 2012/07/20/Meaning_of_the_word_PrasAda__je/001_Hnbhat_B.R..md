I don't think there is any change in the etymology of प्रसाद and प्रासाद as both are derived from the same verb षद्लृ \> सद् \[लृ\] =विशरणगत्यव-सादनेषु used as finite verb प्रसीदति - dwells, pleases or favors etc. prefixed with प्र. The derived primary word with the suffix घञ् gives the meaning of location or instrument or the act of this verb or any कारक except कर्तृ according to the use of the word conventionally fixed. So, प्रासाद means the where deities or kings dwell and प्रसाद means the act of favor, either in cash or kind. (here anything received in token of favor of the God or the king, or it may simply be any act of favor).

  

But I could not understand your

expression'sAdasIdanam' without context or please type in देवनागरी if the word is correctly spelled with context. If you mean this Vedic line:

  

ज्येष्ठराजं ब्रह्मणां ब्रह्मणस्पत आ नः श्रृण्वन्नूतिभिः सीद सादनम्॥

  

the meaning goes to Vedic etymology as given by Yaska in addition to Grammatical ones given by Panini where the expression means simply:

  

"Listen to us with thy graces and reside \[सीद\] in the place (of sacrifice) सादनम्"

  

itself a finite form and another primary derivative from the same verb.
