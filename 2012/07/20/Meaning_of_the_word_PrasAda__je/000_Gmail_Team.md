Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



The word "PrasAda' is so common, we recieve PrasAda in temples or we give food to god and take part of that as PrasAda. Could anybody kindly help me understand etymology of this word please? How the meaning of 'sAda' as in 'sAdasIdanam' fits into the word 'PrasAda'. Please pardon me for my ignorance. Thanks. N.R.Joshi
