Dear Colleagues,

The following mail gives some information that call for our serious attention. We know of illegal attempts at copyright encroachment upon traditional Indian herbs like neem. The attempt was foiled by our country. The following forwarded letter informs of attempts to extend 'copyright' upon the traditional Indian pothi format where the leaves are bound in horizontal sequence and not in the vertical one as in the middle-eastern format that was adopted by the West. If it is true we must demolish the ill concveived plan. The Nirnay Sagar Press brought out a large number of books in the Pothi format. In Bengal it is common to print paurohitya treattises in the pothi format on palmleaves. We cannot lose this traditional right over a system that was invented in India.

I hope colleagues will agree with me.

It will be relevant to remember that book binding was invented in India. In the West books meant not bound leaves but long scrolls that went out of fashion with the coming of the book.  

Best

Dipak Bhattacharya

Dear List,

In reading the article "Flipback books: new direction of dead end"

<http://www.thisbloglife.com/2012/07/flipback-books-new-direction-or-dead-end/>

I was astonished to hear that the Dutch publishing company "Jongbloed" (<http://www.jongbloed.com/>) had attached a copyright to theDwarsligger®book format (<http://www.dwarsligger.com/> or <http://www.dwarsligger.nl/>) they pretend to have created in 2009 (see the interview of their international marketing manager at<http://laurastanfill.wordpress.com/2011/05/16/the-flipback-part-2/>

or, in Dutch, of the general manager at<http://www.amboanthos.com/Uploads/pdf/090828%20boekblad%20artikel.pdf>: "the greatest book-innovation after Gutenberg"), and which is known on the English speaking market as the Flipback format (Hodder & Stoughton Publ.), or in French as "ultra- or hyper-poche" (La Martinière Publ.).

I wonder what's the difference with the Pothi form used in Indian printing since the 19th century and still in use in publishing houses like the Venkateswara Press in Mumbai (seethesmallest pocket Bhagavadgita available in Flipback/Pothi form at<http://www.khe-shri.com/khemraj.htm>). Can thisWestern (at least Dutch...)commercial capture (this is not very Christian for a Bible publisher...) of an Indian design remains without reaction?

Best wishes,

Christophe Vielle
