तवल्कार  
  
स्कन्द उवाच  
वक्ष्ये सन्धिसिद्धरूपं स्वरसन्धिमथादितः ।  
दण्डाग्रं सागता दधीदं नदीहते मधूदकं ।। ३५०.१ ।।  
  
पितॄषभः लॄकारश्च तवेदं सकलोदकं ।  
अर्द्धर्च्चोऽयं *तवल्कारः* सैषा सैन्द्री तवौदनम् ।। ३५०.२ ।।  
  
Only it means "your लृकार and my लृकार" as far as the सन्धि context is concerned, as per "उरण् रपरः" which makes the गुण "अ" अल् for the तव+लृकारः.

  

तवल्कारः is a शाखा of ब्राह्मण of सामवेद, after which केनोपनिषत् is called as तवल्कारोपनिषत् aslo.

  

मम + लृकारः will also have the same form अल् as explained by Prof. Bhattacharya, if you want to use it.

  

I don't know why the branch is called तवल्कार. If any of the scholars can through light on this point, it would be highly beneficial. The relation if any between the the expression तव लृकारः and the name of the Upanishat and the branch.

  

May be some episode in the Brahmana itself may be found to justify the name.
