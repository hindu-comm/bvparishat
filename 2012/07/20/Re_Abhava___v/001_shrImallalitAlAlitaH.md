What do you mean by abhAva ?  
If abhAva of pot, etc.  
Then it's wrong. As abhAva of pot is not a means to true cognition.  
Now see your question again. You wrote 'true means to cognition'. This is wrong. It should be 'means of true cognition' which is otherwise called pramANa, i.e., means of valid knowledge(pramA).  
If you want to know about sixth-pramANa counted by bhATTa-mImAMsaka-s and vedAntin-s, then it's name is anupalabdhi-pramANa and it is means of cognition of abhAva. Just opposite to what you said.  
abhAva is known by anupalabdhi. And, anupalabdhi means lack of cognition.  
So, lack of cognition of pot is means to valid knowledge(cognition) of lack of pot.
