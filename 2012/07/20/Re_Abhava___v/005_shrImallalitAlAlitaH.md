A valid question but not presented in correct way.  
It should be :  
If absence of cognition of pot is means of valid cognition of lack of pot, then what in a case where post exists and it's cognition is absent due to darkness. Will this lack of cognition due to obstruction will generate a valid cognition of lack of pot ?  
  
And then answer will be :  
No.  
yogyAnupalabdhiH prmANam.  
It is explained in many ways. But, for simplicity it means that :  
upalabdhuM yogyasya = upalabdhisahakArikAraNasttve upalabdhuM yogyasyApi = provided that all extra causes of cognition of a pot are present and hence pot should be known if present in such condition ; anupalabdhiH = lack of cognition of pot is ; abhAve pramANam = a means to valid knowledge of abhAva of pot.
