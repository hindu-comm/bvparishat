Namaste.  
  
I have heard long ago about some shlokas that give the purpose of women wearing mangaLa dravya-s like kumkum, bangles, ear studs, etc. Does any scholar here have access to those shlokas? One of them related to putting the kumkum on the forehead begins with this word:  
स्वात्मविचारादन्तः...  
  
The shlokas give an adhyAtmic touch to these day-to-day practices. Help in locating the verses will be much appreciated.
