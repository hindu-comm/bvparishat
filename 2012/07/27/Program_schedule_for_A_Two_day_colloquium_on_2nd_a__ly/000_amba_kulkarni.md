Dear all,  

  
I have enclosed the program schedule for the upcoming two day colloquium to mark the 25 years of NLP in Paninian Perspective.  
  
On this occasion we have also planned to Felicitate Prof. K V Ramakrishnamacharyulu for his contribution to this field.  
  
All those who are interested are welcome.  
  
There is no registration, however, we would appreciate if you can inform about your participation in advance to [mohan.ku...@gmail.com]()  
  
With regards,  
Amba Kulkarni
