I don’t know of any books but one may want to get in touch with the following people, who might be able to help with the works, latest research, and other literature in Tantra:



Prof. Somdev Vasudeva: He is a professor at Columbia University and also a visiting professor at University of California at Berkeley. He teaches Sanskrit and has authored several works on Tantra. One of my friends did a course under him at UC Berkeley. He tells me that Prof. Somdev Vasudeva is one of the few people in the West who know Tantra genuinely (for most of the Westerners Tantra has a very narrow meaning). His contact is listed under<http://www.columbia.edu/cu/mealac/programs/undergraduate/>but if somebody wants a personal introduction, I can help.



Dr. Robert Svoboda. The author of several books including the Aghora trilogy and a disciple of the late Aghori Vimalananda of Mumbai. He can be reached at the address listed under<http://www.drsvoboda.com/contact.htm>
