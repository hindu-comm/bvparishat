Dear Scholars,  
  
I am interested to know the possible availability of books/articles on TantraalOka of abhinava gupta. I have read the original text with the commentary of jayaratha and want to know more about the research done on this work. I have also read the book of K.C. Pandey on Abhinava. I will be grateful if am shown better avenues in this regard.  
  
  
with utmost regards  
  
  
ganesh
