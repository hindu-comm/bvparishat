\> As far as I know, not much study, either in an analytical or a comparative  
way, has been done on the Tantraloka which is one of the masterpieces in the  
Tantra sastra. The summary of the contents by Sri Navajivan Rastogi that  
accompanied the latest reprint of the text in 10 vols. that came out a few  
years back is the only available one. There is a thesis written in the Italian  
language published long back of which I have forgotten the author's name.  
Unfortunately not many theses/studies have been undertaken by Bharatiiya  
scholars on this most important text containing a veritable mine of informations  
on Tantrasatra.  
It would be a great service and be a signal contribution if future Bharatiya  
researchers/doctorates focus on the vast Purana and Tantra literature for their  
research studies which corpus is one of the undiminishing and ever-sustaining  
component of our culture.
