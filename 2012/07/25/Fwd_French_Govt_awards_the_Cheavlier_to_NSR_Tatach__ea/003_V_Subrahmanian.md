What an impressive profile!! A life totally dedicated to bhAratIya samskRuti, in several of its facets. A true 'bhArateeyaH' indeed.  
  
I also get the feeling that a strong grounding in nyAyashAstra proves extremely beneficial in mastering the other shAstra-s.  
  
Someone may pl. attach a photograph of his please.
