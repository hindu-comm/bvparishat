aaryaah, svasti \|



I have some questions regarding mantras of Tantrashastra.



1.The Mantras of Veda, like ***Agnimiile Purohitam***have clearsentence pattern, but not the Tantrik mantras like HrimKliim. What is the definition of Tantrik mantra? Is it possible toapply ***mananaan mantrah*** to the mantras like Hriim, Kliim.? I had heard that while concentrating on them, a kind of vibration is experienced in certain portions of our body and, as a result, we will get rid of our physical problems.We shall nottry to extractany meaning from them. For observing the vibration resulted from Tantrik mantras, we have to sit in Vajraasana. Padmaasana is not effective in this regard (I had heard this from a gentleman some ten years ago who claimed that he was a saadhaka). Is it true?



2\. The same gentleman even told me that the mantras like ***Om namo naaraayanaaya, Om namah shivaaya*** etc are considered as maalaamantras and Hriim Kliim etc are biijamantras. Maalaamantrashave more than five syllables.Biijamantras have single syllable. I remember that similar explanation is given in the introduction of Nityashodashikarnava [ed.by](http://ed.by) Sri Vrajavallabhadwivedi.(I am writing this depending on my memory) Please correct me if Iam wrong.



3.What is the sourse of the sentence ***shruti-patha-galitaanaam tantramaarge praveshah*?**



4.I heard that there is a dictionary on Tantrik Mantras namely Mantrabhidhanam. Whoauthoredthis ? Is softcopy of the same available ?
