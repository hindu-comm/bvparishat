Namaste! Sri Jagannatha

"Mantraratnamanjuushaa" by Trivikramabhattaaraka (Nirnayasagar press  
1926) is an interesting book. Following are the chapters:

1.diikshaa-paTala  
2.Saparyaa-p  
3.somasuuryaagnimantra-p  
4.shaivamantravivaraNa-p  
5.shakti-p  
6.VaishNavamantra-p  
7.Paariplavaakhya-p  
8.Yantra-p

I found the text interesting as it connects mantra sounds with  
nakshatras! Also it defines DakshiNaayana as when the airflow is in  
the dakshiNabhaaga. Tadaaniimeva Hrasvaah prabuddhaa bhavanti\|\|  
similarly UttaraayaNa and Vishuva are also defined.

regards

RN Iyengar

\> 3.What is the sourse of the sentence \*shruti-patha-galitaanaam tantramaarge
