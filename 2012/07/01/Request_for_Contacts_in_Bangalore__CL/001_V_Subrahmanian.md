Namaste.  
  
In case you are conversant in conversational Sanskrit, the following  
will be of great help to you in your project:  
  
1. Dr. Haridasa Bhattacharya, who has taught the Nyaya shAstra at the  
Purna prajna vidyapeetha, Bangalore.  
  
2. Dr. D.Prahladachar and Dr. Hayavadana Puranik, both attached to  
the above institution.  
  
You can also discuss Dvaita Vedanta with all the above three.  
  
In case you can make a short trip to Chennai, you will be assured of a  
very great benefit by discussing with Dr. Mani Dravid SastriNaH who is  
well versed in Nyaya, Advaita Vedanta and pUrva mImAmsA. With him you  
can even converse in Hindi apart from Sanskrit. Dr. R.Krishnamurthy  
SastriNaH will also be of much help to you there. I can provide their  
contact details to you by private mail in case you need the same.
