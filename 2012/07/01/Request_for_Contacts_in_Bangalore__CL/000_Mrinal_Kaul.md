Dear All,

  

I would be in Bangalore for the month of August 2012. I am working on Abhinavagupta's Śaiva arguments on the *bimbapratibimbavāda* in his Tantrāloka. He is taking Naiyāyikas to task. I would be grateful if someone could let me know if I can consult an erudite Naiyāyika in Bangalore. I would like to discuss the Naiyāyika perspective in detail. In addition to that I would also love to discuss this topic with a Vedānta expert who might throw more light on theintricacies amongst the perspectives of Dvaita, Advaita and Nyāya.

  

I would sincerely appreciate if one can give me some contacts in Bangalore so that I could make use of my time while I am there. I thank all of you with muchgratitudein advance.

  

With my best wishes.

  

Yours sincerely,

  

Mrinal Kaul
