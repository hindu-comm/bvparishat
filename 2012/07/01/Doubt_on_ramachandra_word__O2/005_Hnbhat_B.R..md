I don't think the question was whether the compound word रामचन्द्र was used or not, either as compound or isolated. Nor any other names used in Ramayana itself was the point of query. But the question in my opinion whether the compound word was used as such in Valmiki's Ramayana or a later usage.

  

The question was around the opinion

  

रामाय रामभद्राय रामचन्द्राय वेधसे।

रघुनाथाय नाथाय सीतायाः पतये नमः॥

  

which has several other compounds used to denote श्रीरामः, दाशरथिः as found in रामरक्षास्तोत्र ascribed to अगस्त्य.

  

The popular line "रामचन्द्र कृपालु भज मन्" in the voice of Mm. Subbulakshmi and Mm. लताजी ever rings in our ears for years which was composed by तुलसीदास the promoter of भक्ति cult in medieval India who had some more verses in Sanskrit too among his works composed in व्रजभाषा the language of the common people of his time.

  

I don't understand from which stand point the query was raised.
