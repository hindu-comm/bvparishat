 And there will probably be as many talking about Ramsamooj's SALT Model, with the audience consisting mainly of his relatives and the hapless Bhutanese refugees dragged down from his SALT school.



 What has any of this got to do with the Vedas? Does Veda include self-promotion?



 It is comical, really.



best,

Rajaram

Subject: \[RajivMalhotraDiscussion\] Waves conf to hold 5 sessions with 14 speakers on BEING DIFFERENT  
To: [RajivMalhot...@yahoogroups.com]()  
  
  



Friday starts the 2012 Waves Conference in Dartmouth. I recommend all those who can make it to please do so. (You can get details at: <http://wavesinternational.net/D_Pages/Home.aspx> )  
  
The three-day conference is organized into four parallel tracks. I am glad to say that thanks to the organizational initiatives of Aditi and Ravi (both board members), they have dedicated a whole track to BD. This means that 5 sessions consisting of 14 speakers will address this theme. Please see the list of sessions and speakers on BD below. The final session is to brainstorm how scholars who are interested may assist BD research, publishing and marketing.
