Dear Sri Ganesh  
  
First of all, changing a group discussion into a personal one and then changing it again into a group discussion is not in accordance with netiquette (the Internet version of etiquette or इतिकृत्य). Still as you replied to the group, I am answering to the group in accordance with netiquette guidelines. I do hope the moderators of bvparishat allow this email, they have blocked some of my emails in the past. I have the following points to make.  

-   Unfortunately, you have not understood my position - you may want to
    reread my emails. In my first mail I wrote "I am not qualified
    enough to comment on the interpretation by आद्यशङ्कराचार्यपाद",
    which was showing my respect towards Śaṅkarācārya. I reiterate -
    **grammatically**, both interpretations are correct. I believe it to
    be ईश + आवास्यम् (the interpretation by my Guru and also as listed
    by V S Apte). You are free to believe in the other one.  
-   Thirdly, the discussion was not triggered by me. If was started by
    somebody else and I was one of the posters on the thread in favour
    of उत्तरपक्ष, just like there were some posters in favour of
    पूर्वपक्ष. So here again you are wrong in saying that I trigerred
    the discussion with the objective of finding faults with
    interpretation of Śaṅkarācārya. -   Even though I am not qualified enough to pronounce judgements on
    Śaṅkarācāryas, numerous commentators have differed with and
    contradicted Śaṅkarācārya on many counts, just like Śaṅkarācārya
    himself has differed with and contradicted several others. -   Regarding "has already been shown by many and me too as a case that
    finds little water" -> that is a one-sided claim, an opinion which
    may not necessarily be a fact. I can make the counter-claim that the
    arguments have been shown by me as cases that find no water. I would
    not claim so, but I will only say that I have raised points to
    counter the पदद्वयत्व argument of Sh. Ramanujan and the अनित्यत्व
    argument of Sh. Subramanyam Korada.

Finally, I must add that so far there has not been a single and complete citation of the usage of the word ईट् from the Vedas, the Upanishads, the Puranas, the Smritis, the famous Kavyas or the lexicons.  

Thanks, Nityanand
