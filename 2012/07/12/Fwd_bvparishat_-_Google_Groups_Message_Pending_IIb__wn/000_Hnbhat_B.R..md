Dear Nityanandaji,

  
That is good idea and decision. You can take the interpretation of your "guru" as correct and that is all. That does not mean the interpretation by Sri Sankara is not correct as it is not found in any lexicons or dictionaries as all the possible derivation of participles from all the verbs need not find entry in the dictionaries.  
  
Therefore absence of entry in any dictionary doesn't mean the form is incorrect anyway. Both interpretations are possible and both are grammatically correct. The interpretations may differ according to the commentators' presentation of the purport according to their policy adopted in interpreting. If your guruji find it incorrect, or disprove the interpretation, that is a different thing.

  

  

I am reminded a statement by Mahimabhatta:

  
इह संप्रतिपत्तितोऽन्यथा वा ध्वनिकारस्य वचोविवेचनं नः।

नियतं यशसे प्रपत्स्यते यन्महतां संस्तव एव गौरवाय।।

  

Instead of ध्वनिकार you an add apply to th present context भाष्यकार (i.e.Shankaracarya).

  

Either by disagreement or agreement with the views of the Great People, one can earn popularity.

  

This much can be said on the dispute. Sorry for interfering.
