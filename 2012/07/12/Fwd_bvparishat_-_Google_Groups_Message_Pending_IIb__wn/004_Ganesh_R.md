Dear Sir,  
  
i am very sorry to say that I wont reply you in this regard as you have not at all understood my basic contention. I have already told that I wont reply further as the discussion triggered by you with the main purpose of finding fault with Sankara's usage has already been shown by many and me too as a case that finds little water. I once gagin stick to the point that the right minded people are requested to visit my earliest mail in this thread and that will suffice for all practical purposes.  
  
Having not an iota of ill-feeling regarding any body i submit my self to the learned lore  
  
warm regards  
  
ganesh
