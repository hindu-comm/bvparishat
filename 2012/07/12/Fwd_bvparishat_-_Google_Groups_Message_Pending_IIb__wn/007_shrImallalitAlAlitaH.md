A scholar posted an attachment showing that all old commentators take ईशा as a सुबन्तपदम् . How all are saying the same when the imaginations that ईशावास्यम् is a samasta-padam is quite easy ?  
Thinking of ईट् as a dhAtu is difficult. Even then they all are going to that. Why ?  
I think our ignorance or neglection of vaidika-svara-s is making us go different from Olds. There may be some mark to show that ईशा वास्यम् is the pATha, i.e some svara-chihna must be there to mark that ईशा is a single padam. Hope someone will show it to us.  
A commentary told स्वरितम् somewhere. Let us check.
