Dear Nityanand Mishra Mahoday,

  

If I have understood correctly, your Guruji has said thatईट् is notused by any previous lexicographers and therefore it is अनुचितं (inappropriate).

  

However, if we see theआनंदभाष्य byश्री रामानंद आचार्य at<https://archive.org/details/IshavasyaAnandaBhashyam/> then we see that he too has specified the term ईट् .

  

So does it mean that the term ईट् used by श्री रामानंद आचार्य is also inappropriate? If I understand correctly, श्री रामानंद आचार्य is the original guru of the रामानंदसंप्रदाय , and your Guruji belongs to that same संप्रदाय. So how can a later Guruji say that a previous Guru's position is inappropriate?

  

regards,

  

Jaidev Bhat.
