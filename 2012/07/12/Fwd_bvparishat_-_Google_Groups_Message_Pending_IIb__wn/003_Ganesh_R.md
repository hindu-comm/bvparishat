I don't think that 'eeT' is an obscure word that denotes the God or Lord. In many of the classical poems in Sanskrit, Telugu, Kannada I have come across this I my self has used in several occasions. To just remind the scholars one can refer to the famous tongue twirler "vaaashcaarEDdhvaja....." supposed to have baffled the ekasandhaagraahin, dvisandhaagraahin etc...Those who are well versed with the works of scholar-poets like shivasvaami, ratnaakrara, shreeharSha, aeshvarakavi, aanandavardhana and the like know that eeT is not rarity. It is not even ungrammatical. Most of the times our traditional scholars go for such an idle job of pondering on the insignificant in the context of a great discourse. This one of the avanatilakShna-s of vidvattaa in our classical tradition. People like M. Hiriyanna, P.V. Kane, V. Raghavan, S. N. Dasgupta, Ganganath Jha and many more of their order have warned at this long ago.
