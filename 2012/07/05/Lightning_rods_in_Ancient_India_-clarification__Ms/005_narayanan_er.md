Respected scholars,

Namaskarah.  

  

Could it not be too early to predict that Indians hadn't been aware of protection from from lightning? As being an architectural text, the Tantrasamuccaya recommends the copper crests being hooked up to be established atop. There are copper plates installed under the earth before constructing a temple. I hope I can quote a few verses in the coming days after referring to the Tantarasamuccaya. It has not at all been said the purpose of such fittings for such and such protections etc. But it was a general assumption on the context of conductivity of metals where copper is more electro conductive to Iron etc. There is no question of any sort of complex of being an Indian to be an inferior or superior. I didn't neither claim that the ancient Indians knew about electricity or electronics as we are accustomed to work with nowadays. But we have to assume that there could have thunder and lightning in ancient times too. Inverted club like copper crests atop temples could hardly be an ornamentation that I believe.  

In the first mail by Madhusoodana Bhat there had no hint about Professor Vijay Pal Shastri's quotations from Ravigupta's Lokasamvyavaharapravrtti, which is claimed to be a 7th century A.D. work. Professor Shastri quotes the following verse:

कश्चित् क्वचिद् बलीया-

न्नैकः सर्वार्थसाधनायालम्।

शैलं भिनत्ति वज्रं

स्वयमेति भिदां विषाणेन।।

Professor Shastri gives a prose order to this:  

कश्चित् क्वचिद् बलीयान् एकः सर्वार्थसाधनाय अलं न। वज्रं शैलं भिनत्ति स्वयं विषाणेन भिदाम् एति।

This verse also does not claim that the Indians had a knowledge of electric current or electronic flow at that time. Professor Shastri assumes the meaning for वज्रम् (thunderbolt) as lightning which hits the mountain in the form of a flow of current and विषाणः as a discharger (please see MM Williams Dictionary). From the pdf (prasna) file that he sent to the BVP and others the intentions are quite clear that the current could be broken with the help of metal dischargers and as if this case is applicable to the mountains, it could be for the buildings too.

Moreover, yes, Sirs, it was naturally a strained effort to write in Sanskrit but that interpretation is not at all a result of any complex and I consider myself as neither superior nor inferior rather than trying for perfection.

Thanks with respect and many regards,

Narayanan
