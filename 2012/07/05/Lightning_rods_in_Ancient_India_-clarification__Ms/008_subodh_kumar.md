Respected Scholars,

From the on going discussions about Lightening rods, I am emboldened to share with all my study of Yajurved Chapter 17. This apter is basically addressed to Maruts, but on closer scrutiny also lays bare the latest knowledge on microbes. The last mantras are repeat of Rig Ved 4.58. I see in these mantras modern knowledge about lipids, cholesterol, cow's milk HDL, LDL and a healthy heart.

I shall be grateful to get expert comments on my layman interpretations.

I have been also studying Rig Ved Marut sookts also with this concept in mind, and will be glad to share my interpretations with like minded scientist veda scholars.

With best regards to all,

Subodh Kumar
