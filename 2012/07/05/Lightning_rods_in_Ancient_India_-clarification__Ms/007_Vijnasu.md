Namaste,

Electric current is one type of Chaitanya. Veda give basic  
formulas for the same. In Vaidika Bauthashastra, the Rishis elaborate  
the explanation of ChaitanyaVaahakaas, ChaitanyaBhedaka, Mitrabheda,  
Tantrabheda, etc., with respect to Anu Vidhya. Kapila Muni, the  
supreme scholar of Anu Vidhya also gives lot of Prayogas with these  
kind of Parikaras. The basic formulas are practically implemented in  
Tantras. In Dakshin Kannada, Kerala and also some parts of India there  
are Agamokta Devalayas, the engineer to design & maintain the same is  
called Tantri. Its common that engineers do a plan and the technical  
team implement with the help of workers. But the plan the Tantri  
designs is known only to him. Its called Tantra Rahasya, which may not  
be known to public. It may not be published in available books. But  
the traditional Tantris know it well. Only one Tantra Samucchaya is  
available now. That too its a part of Devalaya Pratista & related  
issues. There are 64 Tantra Samucchayas covering crores of Shlokas.

Our Poorvajas were well aware of thunderbolts & had taken  
necessary precautions to avoid the same. Just an instance is Dhwaja  
Sthanba which acts as thunder resister and also to protect the Graama  
from 13 other Utpaatas. The circuit design is Shadadhara. Every Agama  
available now discusses rituals of Shadadhara Pratista. But technical  
details are hidden. The design plans were also Pranthiya (Regional).  
An instance is that the seers understood the necessity of resisting  
the thunderbolts in Dakshin Kannada and the result of their plan made  
lakhs of Deva & Daiva Sthanas to neutralize the lightning. The power  
to resist is the Kalaa Vruddhi by doing various Sevas, Upasanaas,  
Alankaaras, Utsavaas, etc., But nowadays in the name of renovation  
most of the Devalayas opened by people who are unaware of the circuit  
design, proper connections & working details do Punarpratista which  
may give Phala to Bhakta but the resistivity to natural phenomenon is  
gone. The result of which from decades, the amount of lightning being  
hit to the ground has drastically increased.

The formulas are properly explained in Vaidhika Bautashastra's  
"Ananda Naamaka Adhyaya". Which gives all the necessary details about  
nature, its vitality, variations, Utpaatas & Upasamhaaras. Direct way  
of holding a resister against the lightning is also done by using  
suitable metals. But tantra sutras caution that its not permanent. On  
top of this temporary materials Utpaata Upasamhaara should be done in  
the Tatwa level. The corresponding tatwas (much much minute than  
atoms) should be treated well and corrections should be done in  
Khagola for which Khagola Ganita with combination of Astra Ganitha is  
there for calculations purpose. Then the Pooja Vidhana & other special  
rituals are combined to neutralize the intended utpaata by increasing  
the capacitance, resistance. Conductance will also be used for Deva-  
Bhakta Sambanda.

What are Yantras? Nothing but convertors of Shabda Taranga to  
Kirana Taranga. Electricity is nothing but the vyavahaara of Electro-  
Magnetic Waves. Tantra is thousand time advanced, mature & cautious  
than the present science.

The available Bruhit Samhita of Varahamihira at least discusses  
about some of the Utpatas like Dhumaketu, AshaniPaata, etc., Its just  
a collection from various sources. Lot more is there in the Prabandhas  
submitted by lot of Rishis, Tantris, Dharshana Shastrakaaras,  
Siddhantis, Jyotishkaas, Pandits, etc.,

Just by decoding some sutras from Tantras and Vedas, there are  
lot of Bombs, Missiles, Weapons have been prepared for self  
destruction. Its better that there should user based access level for  
all the branches of Knowledge.

\> Could it not be too early to predict that Indians hadn't been aware of protection from from lightning? As being an architectural text, the Tantrasamuccaya recommends the copper crests being hooked up to be established atop. There are copper plates installed under the earth before constructing a temple. I hope I can quote a few verses in the coming days after referring to the Tantarasamuccaya. It has not at all been said the purpose of such fittings for such and such protections etc. But it was a general assumption on the context of conductivity of metals where copper is more electro conductive to Iron etc. There is no question of any sort of complex of being an Indian to be an inferior or superior. I didn't neither claim that the ancient Indians knew about electricity or electronics as we are accustomed to work with nowadays. But we have to assume that there could have thunder and lightning in ancient times too. Inverted club like copper crests atop

\> In the first mail by Madhusoodana Bhat there had no hint about Professor Vijay Pal Shastri's quotations from Ravigupta's Lokasamvyavaharapravrtti, which is claimed to be a 7th century A.D. work. Professor Shastri quotes the following verse:  
\> कश्चित् क्वचिद् बलीया-  
\> न्नैकः सर्वार्थसाधनायालम्।  
\> शैलं भिनत्ति वज्रं  
\> स्वयमेति भिदां विषाणेन।।  
\> Professor Shastri gives a prose order to this:  
\>  
\> कश्चित् क्वचिद् बलीयान् एकः सर्वार्थसाधनाय अलं न। वज्रं शैलं भिनत्ति स्वयं विषाणेन भिदाम् एति।  
\> This verse also does not claim that the Indians had a knowledge of electric current or electronic flow at that time. Professor Shastri assumes the meaning for वज्रम् (thunderbolt) as lightning which hits the mountain in the form of a flow of current and विषाणः as a discharger (please see MM Williams Dictionary). From the pdf (prasna) file that he sent to the BVP and others the intentions are quite clear that the current could be broken with the help of metal dischargers and as if this case is applicable to the mountains, it could be for the buildings too.  
\> Moreover, yes, Sirs, it was naturally a strained effort to write in Sanskrit but that interpretation is not at all a result of any complex and I consider myself as neither superior nor inferior rather than trying for perfection.
