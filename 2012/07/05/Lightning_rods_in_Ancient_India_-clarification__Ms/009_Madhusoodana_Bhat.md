Respected scholars,

I am greatly indebted to all scholars who gave their learned opinion in the matter. I am sure many more would give their versions soon.

The mail of Sri Subodh Kumar appears to have diverted the issue from this thread. I request Sri Subodh Kumar to initiate a fresh discussion about Maruts in a new thread, so that Maruts and Lightning Rods are not mixed confusing every one in the process.

  

Request scholars to continue discussion in this thread about Lightning Rods in Ancient India.
