The Brihadaranyaka upanishad statement: तमेतं वेदानुवचनेन ब्राह्मणा विविदिषन्ति यज्ञेन दानेन तपसा अनाशकेन forms the basis for the prescription of karma anushThAnam in the vaidika sampradaya. The Bhgavadgita 18th chapter verse : यज्ञो दानं तपः कर्म कार्यमेव तत् .. पावनानि मणिषिणाम् is the smRti support based on the shruti. These are chittashuddhi kAraNaani recognized by the Veda. Gradually they have the विविदिषाजनकत्वम्. With the तत्त्वजिज्ञासा owing to the prior performance of the above karma-s with the attitude of worship/submission to the Lord: यज्ञार्थात् कर्मणोऽन्यत्र लोकोऽयं कर्मबन्धनः (if the vihita karma-s are not performed with the attitude of offering, they become burdens, they bound the doer and he will remain in bondage) one will take up enquiry into the Supreme and finally attain liberation. Thus the purpose of the veda-enjoined action like agnihotra, tapas, daanam, etc., is परंपरया मोक्षहेतुत्वम्.  

    The scripturally ordained yajna, dAna and tapas are aimed at purifying one's
    mind and generating relish for Atman-knowledge.  The Bhagavadgita 3rd and
    18th chapters state the importance of vedic yajna as a means to
    chittashuddhi. The following article focuses on the various types of
    yajna-s:
