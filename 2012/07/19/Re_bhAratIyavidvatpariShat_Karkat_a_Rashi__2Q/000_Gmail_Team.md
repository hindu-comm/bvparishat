Dear Prof. S. Korada,



Many thanks for explaining details of my astrological question. Do you have any opinion on Sun Rashi 12 blocks as described by Western astrologers. There is 23 and half degree difference between Nirayan and Saayan astrology. Sometimes Indian astrology (Nirayan) tells us Sun Rashi as Cancer but according to Saayan calculations it comes out different. Under this situation which Rashi correctly describes psychology ( like Cancer is not as strong as Leo) of the person. Please pardon me for asking you more questions. Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
