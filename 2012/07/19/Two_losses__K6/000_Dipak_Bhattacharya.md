We lost a colorful personality and an active worker for the cause of Sanskrit in Professor Dhyaneshnarayan. We shall feel it for years. Another loss was that of a more silent scholar devoted to the cause of Sanskrit namely Professor Dr. Brahmananda Gupta of the same Universiity who died four days before Dhyaneshnarayan. He worked on Jayanta Bhaṭṭa’s Nyayamañjarī, but his main attraction was a profound knowledge of Āyurveda on which he was an accepted authority in Kolkata. Gupta’s Āyurvedic training was at home from his father the late Bimalananda Kaviraj and shortly from his grandfather Shyamadas Kaviraj. The vacuum is not likely to be filled up very soon.
