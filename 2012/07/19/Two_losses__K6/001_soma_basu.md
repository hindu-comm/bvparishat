The pain seems unbearable by the loss of MM. Prof. Dhyaneshnarayan  
Chakrabarti and Prof. Dr. Brahmananda Gupta.  
Though they belonged to the Rabindra Bharati University, their  
scholarship was global, for which their names will be remembered for  
many years to come.  
  
Apart, they were great souls, loved by all.  
  
May their rest be eternal...  
  
There is grief; there is death, the fire of separation  
Yet there is serenity, yet there is joy, yet Infinity is awake…  
  
ananta alay yar kiser bhavana tar ...  
  
There is no mean warmth of mourning; no there is none/  
Who has his dwelling in Infinity what worries can one have?  
  
  
There is every doubt if their loss will be filled ever;  
  
  
Soma Basu
