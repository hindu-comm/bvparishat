This question is for Prof. S. Korada. What is english name for Karkata Rashi. There is Sun sign, Moon sign and Langna (rashi rising on the eastern horizon at the time of birth). Which one important and why?
Sometimes in India astrologers make horoscope and counting houses from Candra Rashi. Some astrologers talk only about Nakshatras. This is very confusing for people like me illiterate in astrology. Thanks to Prof. S. Korada for offering bonus information in his postings. It helps me a lot. N.R.Joshi.
