नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

**ज्योतिषम् -- जातकस्कन्धः**

  

Karkata is Cancer .  
  
आत्मा प्रभावश्शक्तिश्च पितृचिन्ता रवेः फलम् ।

  

मनो बुद्धिं प्रसादं च मातृचिन्ता च चन्द्रमाः ॥ ( **मुहूर्तदीपिका - कारकनिघण्टुः 1**

)

आत्मा = शरीरम्

  

Ravi for body and Candra for mind (चन्द्रमा मनसो’जायत - **यजुर्वेदः - पुरुषसूक्तम्)**

  

राशीनामुदयो लग्नम्

  

Since body + mind = human being , one has to study from both रविलग्न and चन्द्रलग्न (generally called राशिः)

  

In which नक्षत्र you are born ? - i.e. in which नक्षत्र Candra was
when you were born .

In fact , every planet will be there in some नक्षत्र or the other .

महादशा - अन्तर्दशा etc is calculated following the birth star of Candra .

  

The लग्न in the horoscope is that of Ravi .

  

Candralagna (Rasi) is the one where Candra is written in the horoscope .

The सार्धसप्तमशनि (साढेसात्) is calculated from Rasi .

  

One has to take both दशाशेष ( as per the planetary line up from Ravilagna) and the present planetary position as per the yearly पञ्चाङ्गम् (as per the Candralagna) and give results depending on बलाबल् of planets.

  

कुजदोष (माङ्गलिक - internet) is to be seen from लग्न , राशि and शुक्र ।

  

The results given in some weeklies etc. are (if stars are taken) following चन्द्रराशि . So they are to be tallied with personal
horoscope .

  

People born in Karkatarasi , just like Candra"s movement , up and down,
feel in extremes - I am the happiest / most worried .

धन्यो’स्मि
