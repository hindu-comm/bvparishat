Respected Scholars, Namaskar!

Thanks to Shree Subrahmanian V. for bringing this subject for discussion. There is mention of Kakshasena in your posting. Dr. Roychowdhary has mentioned (in his book-Political History of Ancient India) that Kakshasena was step brother of Paarikshit Janamejaya. Abhipratarin was the son of Kakshasena. My research in Mahabharata extention to the Western countries shows that Mahabharata Empire was divided second time (first time-Bhis'ma did and gave western half to Pandavas). Eastern portion was kept by Janamejaya and Western portion was given to Kakshasena. Finally descendants of Janamejaya gradually moved inside the subcontinent and disappeared in the population of north India. When Alexander reached border of India, we do not see any Kurus and Kambojas fighting with Alexander. On the other hand we find them fighting with Alexander in the middle-east.Chandragupta came from eastern Magadha.

Rigveda mentions war of Indra with Ladies kingdom. Also the name Rushama mentioned in Rigveda was discussed on this list before. Mujavant was in the north of Pamir plato. In the mountainous region of Pakistan the Kaafiras were worshipers of Devas. They resisted conversion to Islamfor thousands of years. We need linguistic scholars from Chitral, Baltistan, Kafiristhan and Uzbekistan. Professor Naranga had good information from that region.Ancient Chinese knew that Heaven was on their southwestern border. If we decide to ignore our neighbors and be happy with roaming within the truncated India, just think what will happen to Mahabharata history after one thousand years.



When I present information in India, educated professors say we teach Mahabharata for developing Values in our children. I say to all please go to library and find out yourself and give me references, then I will go to library and do more research. So we can grow in our knowledge. HIstory does not disappear by ignoring it.
