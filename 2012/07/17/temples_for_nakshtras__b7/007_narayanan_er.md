Respected Sir,

You have rightly said. There we hear:

*अग्निहोत्रं* तपः सत्यं वेदानां चैव पालनम्। आतिथ्यं वैश्वदेवश्च इष्टमित्यभिधीयते॥  

*अग्निहोत्रं त्रयो* वेदास्त्रिदण्डं भस्मगुण्ठनम्। बुद्धिपौरुषहीनानां जीविका धातृनिर्मिता॥

Still the increasing number of temples like the parallel and simultaneous substitutes for the viharas (viharas existed before ghasnabis and mughals invaded India) in the are the extensive trends. Thousands of people converging on different shrines with at most devotion believing the deity once or more praised could solve their personal problems. Astrological counsellings too encourage for such pilgrimage etc. Any of such crowd with devotion do not even demand any of the gods in such shrines about the knowledge of ultimate truth or the knowledge of grammar, logic etc. But they demand in different formats by surrendering their ego at one shrine, to eradicate their sorrows of different nature. Counsellings in different ways leads in depriving the mass for temporary advantages. The functions of the poojaakaarins of temples do not demand any correct mantra with meanings are known. With only twenty people alive knew the mantras correctly still the demands for temple work are for two hundred thousands of people at least in India. This situation cannot easily be changed. Thanks.

Regards,

Narayanan
