This has raised a very pertinent question: What is the authentic source for the list of 27 temples for the 27 nakshatra-s and ALSO FOR THE 9 TEMPLES for the Navagraha-s.  
In fact I also since long have been asking the scholars/temple priests about this but till now there is no clear answer.  
Generally the Sthalapuraana-s are the most authentic sources for any 'tradition' and beliefs concerning a particular holy place or a temple; but as far as I know and to the best of the knowledge of many authorities there is NO REFERENCE TO THESE IN THE STHALAPUTANA-S OF THE CONCERNED TEMPLES.  
Further, we should bear in mind that most of these 'special' temples are Siva temples and have also been glorified by the great Saiva saints--Naayanmaar-s--such as Tirujnanasambandhar, Tirunaavukkaracar, Sundarar--who have sung in their Tevaaram Hymns the greatness of each one of these temples WITHOUT OMITTING ANY DETAILS AND CUSTOMS that prevailed there. But WE DO NOT FIND ANY REFERENCE/MENTION to the 27 Nakshatra or to the 'Navagraha-s' in the Tevaaram Hymns.  
  
Even some 40/50 years back visiting these 27 temples or the so called 'Navagraha temples' mainly for some "PARIHAARAM" was totally unknown.  
It is a TOTAL MISNOMER to call them Navagraha temples and it is also misleading AS MOST OF THEM ARE SIVA TEMPLES where Siva is the main deity .  
The list of 27 temples for 27 nakshatra-s seems to be a recent one.  
Probably we can expect some more of this type of lists in future !!!!  
  
If this is the situation what could be the source of these 'modern' beliefs ???  
  
May be the UBIQUITOUS BELIEF IN ASTROLOGY, taking advantage of which many astrologers promote such practices ???  
  
But I am sure none of us can deny that THIS HAS LEAD TO CRASS COMMERCIALISATION OF ONE OF THE LOFTY PRACTICES OF OUR SANATANADHARMA, namely, VISITING TEMPLES FOR GETTING HIGHEST SPIRITUAL BENEFITS.  
  
Regarding the 'PARIHAARAM' to be done by persons born in one these 27 Nakshatra-s as advised by the astrologers, I would like to know why anybody should do PARIHAARAM FOR HAVING BEEN BORN IN A PARTICULAR NAKSHATRA ? What is meant by the 'PARIHAARAM' in this case?  
  
One CAN BE BORN ONLY IN ANY ONE THESE 27 NAKSHATRA-S and there is no other way EXCEPT GETTING MOKSHA BY WHICH THERE IS NO REBIRTH !!!  
  
  
Ganesan
