I saw in some publication of Sahasranama, prescribing certain श्लोक-s respectively in cycles of 8 or 9, to be chanted by those born in the 27 नक्षत्र-s respectively and number of repetition is also specified there as 1008 times each shloka.

  

  

I think this also comes under such astrologers' suggestions category plus publication tactics combined.
