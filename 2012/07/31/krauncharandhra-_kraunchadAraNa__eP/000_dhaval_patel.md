Dear Sir  
There are many references to Prahsuraama making a the in the mount kraunca. Pl refer to the puraaaNic encyclopedia of KriShNa MaNi vaTtam for an easy catch. I had seen a very interesting slide show of Dr. Bhave of Pune who had toured extensively in the route of meghadootam and has even written on it. But I don't know whether it is published or not. Here he had shown the very kraunca randhra and swans passing through that. Even by the nature of migratory birds, we know that it is a fact. I request other scholars to shed more light on this.
