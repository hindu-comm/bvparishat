Respected Scholars, Namaste!



Please help me on this simple problem. What English diacritical mark should I use for Devanagari letter ळ ?

Is it ok to use /lh/ or (Lh) for ळ ?

Also is it OK to use /l/ with dot under itfor Devanagari short vowel ऌ?

In that case what will be the symbol for long vowel ॡ ?

Thanks. N.R.Joshi
