Dear Sirs,

Thanks for highlighting the problem. It was my misunderstanding, as I got confused with the transliteration rules globally approved by scholars. In this way, I request for a checking of the following:  

Malayalam ഴ is ḻa is ழ in Tamil (not used in any other Indian scripts)

Malayalam റ is ṟa is ற in Tamil (not used in any other Indian scripts)  

Malayalam ള is ḷa is ळ in Devanagari ள in Tamil.

  

Yes, we have seen ऌ and ॡ are transliterated as l̥ and l̥̄ respectively. And as you said there is no Unicode character set available for such adjusted below ring combinations.  

Regards,

Narayanan
