Dear Dr. Joshi,

As far as I remember the problem has been discussed here but perhaps
necessarily not satisfactorily for all.

The dot under l represents ळ while a small ring under l represents vocalic ऌ. The small ring under l is available with Gandhari Unicode. A pdf and an xps file with the dot-under l and the ring-under l are attached.

The fine distinction between the ring-under and the dot-under is not maintained in India, not even in the Baraha alphabet. Even Unicode compliance is yet to come for the ring under l. This is a problem. An expert told me that it requires a little less than **$ 100000/- **for getting Unicode compliance for a new character and that none has agreed to bell the cat. I do not know how far of this is true.

Till the introduction of the ring-under in Gandhari Unicode I presented it in a jpeg file. That worked. But even the *JRAS*, London uses the dot-under for both

Best
