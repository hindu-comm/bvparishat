Namaste,  
  
In srImadbhAgavata, the episode of Indra slaying pAkAsura has been  
mentioned. This comes in 11th Chapter of 8th skandha.  
  
At the time of churning of kSIra sAgara, Indra slays 4 demons namely  
Jambhasura, Namuchi, Bala & Paka. Here is the reference in 19th sloka:  
  
////  
  
jambham srutva hatam tasyajnatayo naradad rseh  
namucis ca balah pakastatrapetus tvaranvitah......19th sloka  
  
//  
  
As regards the reference to mantrashAstra, it has been quoted very  
vaguely and i am unable to trace out.  
  
regs,  
sriram
