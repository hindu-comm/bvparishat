AKośa, 1,1.43ab

ṣāṇmāturaḥ śaktidharaḥ kumāraḥ krauñcadāraṇaḥ //

  

  

Mahābhārata, 3, 214, 26-31

describes Skanda, piercing the Kraunca mountain, and through which svans and vultures both travel through the hole, but there is no mention of Parasurama in this context:

  

  

krīḍan bhāti mahāsenas trīṃllokān vadanaiḥ piban /

parvatāgre 'prameyātmā raśmimān udaye yathā // (26)

sa tasya parvatasyāgre niṣaṇṇo 'dbhutavikramaḥ /

vyalokayad ameyātmā mukhair nānāvidhair diśaḥ / (27)

sa paśyan vividhān bhāvāṃś cakāra ninadaṃ punaḥ // (27.3)

tasya taṃ ninadaṃ śrutvā nyapatan bahudhā janāḥ /

bhītāś codvignamanasas tam eva śaraṇaṃ yayuḥ // (28)

ye tu taṃ saṃśritā devaṃ nānāvarṇās tadā janāḥ /

tān apyāhuḥ pāriṣadān brāhmaṇāḥ sumahābalān // (29)

sa tūtthāya mahābāhur upasāntvya ca tāñjanān /

dhanur vikṛṣya vyasṛjad bāṇāñśvete mahāgirau // (30)

bibheda sa śaraiḥ śailaṃ krauñcaṃ himavataḥ sutam /

tena haṃsāś ca gṛdhrāś ca meruṃ gacchanti parvatam // 31//

  

MBh, 6, 107, 44.2

skandaśaktyā yathā krauñcaḥ purā nṛpatisattama //

  

It is the same Kraunca mountain, Rama pierced with his arrow:

  

RāmāyaṇaYu, 47, 38.2

sugrīvam āsādya bibheda vegād guheritā krauñcam ivograśaktiḥ //

  

Yu, 55, 12ab

bāhvantare mārutim ājaghāna guho 'calaṃ krauñcam ivograśaktyā //

  

confirms this fact by way of comparison, in both instances.

  

also the fact that birds fly through it:

  

Yu, 51, 19.2

chidram anye prapadyante krauñcasya kham iva dvijāḥ //

  

Rām, Utt, 7, 28

māler dhanuścyutā bāṇāḥ kārtasvaravibhūṣitāḥ /

viviśur harim āsādya krauñcaṃ patrarathā iva //28.

  

MBh, 7, 109, 29.2

prāviśanmedinīṃ bhīmāḥ krauñcaṃ patrarathā iva /

============

  

Rajashekhara in his बालरामायणम्, states this episode in connection with परशुराम as follows:

  

यः शृङ्गाग्रैः सरणिमरुणत् क्रौञ्चशैलः सहेलं

यातुः शम्भोर्द्धनुरुपनिषत्प्राप्तये पादमूलम्।

सोऽयं कोपाद् वहति विहितं मार्गणैर्भार्गवस्य

छिद्रद्वारं त्रिदिवसरसीहंसयात्रापवित्रम् ॥४.२९॥

  

मुरारि also refers to Parashurama, boring hole with arrows, but without reference to any specific occasion:

But Puranic Encyclopedia of Vettam K Mani, he refers to the allusion by Kalidasa in Meghaduta under the entry Kraunca, and asks to see the entry under Parasurama, for the details of information how the cleft is related to him. But alas I was disappointed on going through the 4 pages of information under Parasurama, without any line relating him to Kraunca pierced by him. But only two references I got above from the poets Rajasekhara and Murari. But I could not find anything related to the competition between Skanda and Parasurama, as alluded by Mallinatha, though both refer to his training in archery under Shiva along with Skanda and there were competitions also in shooting at target and also fighting, in which Parasurama conquering all the other Gana-s, except Skanda who finally was about to use Pasupatastra, but was withdrawn from using it as due to the interference of Girija according to Rajasekhara. And Murari feels Shiva showed partialit towards Parasurama and declared him as the winner.

  

This much information I could gather from these two Rama plays.

  

But failed to find any reference other than given in relation to Skanda, from the DCS database search. Precisely the reference to the shooting competition between Skanda and Parasurama, during their खुरलीकलह .
