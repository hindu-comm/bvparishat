Dear Prof. Misraji,



I am a new member of this group and certainly don't want my very first posts to result in any manaH-kleSa for existing members.



That said, let me also say that all I was doing was to provide some information that I have about the pATha of the text as handed down. My comment about brahmA not being able to find fault was partly in jest, in response to your comment about brahmavAkya. I am a little taken aback that you particularly find fault with it and read more into it than I intended. Surely, anyone who takes a particular Guru's words as brahmavAkya should extend the same courtesy to others who follow other Gurus. Talking of fatwas is quite unwarranted. I can reassure you that this is not the way of those who have high regard for and follow SankarAcArya, but I can't speak for followers of other Gurus.



Secondly, if you read my comment carefully, you will see that I confined my remarks to SankarAcArya's padaccheda. I claimed nothing about his interpretation. Obviously, non-advaita schools are free to interpret differently, but surely, you will agree that padaccheda precedesthe vyAkhyAna on each pAda. All I said was that Sankara felt the need to explain the word as ISA with a dIrgha vowel ending, because that is the pada handed down in in the the only known oral vaidika traditions for the ISopanishat. I said nothing about the specifics of the interpretation. I have no wish to enter into an advaita vs. non-advaita debate on this forum (I am a co-moderater ofanother list focused on advaita and have other avenues to do precisely that). It doesn't need to become a debate unless others wish it to be so. And I don't like to pit it as vaishNava versus advaita either, becauseof various other reasons that I won't go into now.



I am well aware of the points you make about the differences between various traditional authorities on how the pada-s of the Rgveda mantra-s are to be understood. To add to what Prof. Deshpande rightly observes about the austerity of the transmission of the veda - certainly, one can say that prior to the consolidation of an austerity in maintaining the text, there were differences of opinion. This cannot and should not be cited as an excuse by someone who lives much, much later in time, when the text as received has already crystallized into one accepted version. Plus, all the examples you have given so far are about pada-s in the Rgveda, whereas the text in question is from the Sukla yajus. That there are differences of ancient authoritative opinion onthe Rgvedapada-s cannot create artificial differences of authoritative opinion about pada-s in the Sukla yajurveda. This becomes an especially important factor to account for, as the oral transmissions of the various veda texts have been relatively independent of one another. Therefore, IF there are traditional authorities from ancient times who have proposed different parsings of ISAvAsyam and taken issue with the padapATha as it exists today, THEN one can cite some ancient support for the vigraha as ISa + AvAsyam, not otherwise. On the other hand, those who handed down the padapATha and constructed the vikRti pAThas for the vAjasaneyI saMhitA surely knew enough Sanskrit, Vedicand classical,to think of the obviously easier to understand parsing as ISa + AvAsya, but they chose not to make such an emendation to the received pada. As such, the fact that the non-obvious and not so common form ISA is retained in the transmission is all the more reason to privilege it and acknowledge it as such.



Finally, in my humble opinion, the differently proposedparsing is a distinction without a difference. Yes, SankarAcArya explains it with respect to a rare or perhaps unique root word, but both his interpretation and the other interpretation ultimately don't differ much. Whether it is ISA as an independent tritIya vibhakti form as per SankarAcArya or it is ISena AvAsyam as a samAsa, both interpretations resort to the tritIya vibhakti. The addition of the prefix A- to vAsyam does not make a world of difference to the meaning that any commentator can draw out of it, as far as grammar is concerned.  
  
namaskaras,

Vidyasankar
