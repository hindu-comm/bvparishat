The ghana recitation that I have learnt starts (ignoringmarkings for udAtta, anudAtta, svaritaand using M for all pronunciations of anusvAra):



ISAvAsyaM vAsyam ISESA vasyam idam idaM vAsyam ISeSAvAsyam idam \|

vAsyam idam idaM vAsyaM vAsyam idaM sarvaM sarvam idaM vAsyam vAsyam idaM sarvam \| ...



I have not learnt the padapATha formally (one of the quirks of contemporary transmissions of the Veda!), but the above makes it clear that itcan onlybe ISA + vAsyam and not ISa + AvAsyam. If the latter reading is to be accepted, we would have seen a specific occurence of something like "Avasyam ity A vAsyam," which is conspicuously absent.



SankarAcArya's bhAshyas arethroughout very careful in maintaining the received reading and he does not provide a seemingly unusualinterpretation, unlessit is demanded by the reading of the text.Where there are variant readings in different SakhAs, he makes a note of it and interprets consistently.e.g. pravrajeyuH (a vidhi) vs. pravrajanti (not a vidhi) respectively in the mAdhyandina and kANva rescensions of the bRhadAraNyakopanishat. In the taittirIyopanishad bhAshya, he explicitly gives numerous grammar specific comments, e.g. the form SIkshAis explained as"dairghyaM cchAndasam" and the change of aSnute to pluta A(3)in "kaScit samaSnutA(3) u" is specifically noticed and commented upon. He provides an explanation for the word ISA, becausesuch is the pada in the received text, which he keeps as is.



With all due respect to other AcAryas, brahmA himself cannot find fault with SankarAcArya's padaccheda here.
