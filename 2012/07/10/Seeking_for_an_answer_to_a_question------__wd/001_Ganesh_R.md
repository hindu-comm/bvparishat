Dear Sir,  
  
During 1984 and 1985 two international conferences, first of their kind, one on prtyaksha and the other on anumaana, were held in Bangalore under the headship if Swami Sri Pramaananda Bhaarati regrading the knowledge representation as found in our sastra-s and modern sciences. Many out standing traditional and modern scholars inn pada-vaakya-pramaaNa lore along with brilliant scientists came together and the whole proceedings are now in print. Pl contact the Swamiji or the Sringreri mutt.Many papers in Sanskrit and English are available. I have often felt that an E-version of these wouldl be of great help to the seekers  
  
  
regards
