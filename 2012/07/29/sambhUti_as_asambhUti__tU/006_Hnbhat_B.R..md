HariH Om.

  

Yes. I too noticed the explanations on the word असंभूति and संभूति, except the solution to the question specifically you had raised.

  

The question is yet complicated, as it pre-supposes the "a" as elided in "sandhi" between the two words in two independent verses as is available today the last word of verse 13 and the first word \[अ\]संभूति। In the first instance itself, श्रीशंकराचार्य, had made no such remark in verse 14th itself. But only in the next verse last पाद. I think there is some thing missed in the word by word explanations of the sentence of शाङ्करभाष्य and deep interpretations by both the scholars above.

  

  

I noticed something strange. It is in the second पाद the "mantra" says, where there is clearly he has split,

  

विनाशेन मृत्युं तीर्त्वा+

\[अ\]संभूत्या अमृतमश्नुते।

  

and then asks to take अ in respect of the first word also in the beginning, even though he has not commented anything, in the first occurrence. Now this has statement been taken as supported by प्रकृतिलय-फल-श्रुति by this splitting with"a". This has been accomplished with inserting the "अ" प्रश्लेष by महीधर also, but in the word विनाश instead of असंभूति, in both places, which he justifies as referring to the earlier verses:

  

’अन्यदेवाहुः संभवादन्यदाहुरसंभावात्’, which he offers an alternative explanation for the same verse after he has commented as संभूति and विनाश in the first place.

  

संभूत्युपासनयोरेकपुरुषार्थत्वात् समुच्चय एव युक्त इत्याह।

As it can be seen in the image, he prefers अ-वर्ण with विनाश in both places, instead of संभूति, unlike श्रीशंकर. But this makes the possibility of अ-प्रश्लेष both in संभूति or विनाश in the same manner, पृषोदरादि, which is the short cut to regularize irregular compounds generally and any irregular word. Mallinatha, makes कोविद as a compound of ओकः and विद. In the same way, we can have a compound with "अ" and संभूति or विनाश, and elide अ, due to पृषोदरादि, if one wants to defend the commentaries. But both seek support from प्रकृतिलयश्रुति as is evident from the last sentence.

  

As the "sandhi" may not be permissible between विचचक्षिरे+ in the end of the previous verse and \[अ\] संभूति in the beginning of the next verse. But पृषोदरादि is possible, just like महीधर has done with विनाश in the same mantra. And पदपाठ is available for संहिता only, which is ऋक् or यजुस् divided into अनुवक, कण्डिका etc. within the sections, ऋक्, or कण्डिका. But it depends on the commentators also. In the Edition with the भाष्य of उव्वट and महीधर, though स्वर is available for संहिता, there is no पदपाठ given. The commentator anyhow, takes them as they are, and comments in both ways without change in the inflected form for the संहितापाठ as विनाश or संभूति. Only with "sandhi" the accent in पदपाठ may differ, but not on the commentator's volitional interpretation as पृषोदरादि formation. Hence in the case of श्रीशंकराचार्य's commentary also the same justification can be given. Here is his relevant portion

Hope this solve the issue raised.
