From the above explanation we see that apart form taking विनाश as अविनाश Mahidhara has also changed the phalam of the upAsana. In Shankara bhashya the Hiranyagarbhopasana phalam is अणिमादिसिद्धिरूपानैशवर्यमृत्युतरणम् . And through the avyAkRtopaasana the phalam is प्रकृतिलय. This has been changed in Mahidhara commentary. For him the Hiranyagarbhopasana phalam is prakRtilaya and the avyAkRtopAsana phalam is anaishvaryarUpamRtyutaraNam. This is somewhat odd as in the hierarchy avyAkRta is above Hiranyagarbha. And as such the phalam also is superior for avyAkRtopAsana.  
  
This is just my observation.
