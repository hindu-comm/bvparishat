Sir,  
  
I humbly point out that I did address that particular question raised excepting of course the grammatical explanations of पृषोदरादि etc. which are beyond my knowledge.:  
  
 Namaste.  
  
// My *guess* is that the first word goes as ' सम्भूतिम्' alone (in the padapATha). In other words, Shankara has taken it as सम्भूतिम् alone as can be seen in the beginning of the bhashyam. \[this addresses the question about the 'pada pATha'.\] *He suggests, later,* that in keeping with the phalashruti in the 14th mantra for 'asambhUti upAsana' namely: prakRti layaH, one should 'take' the first word of this mantra as 'asambhUti'. That is why He says: 'a-varNalopena *nirdeshaH* draShTavyaH.' So, according to Him the mantra is doing the ’nirdesha’ of the word asambhUti as 'sambhUti', by doing the the lopa of the letter 'a'. असम्भूतिरेव अवर्णलोपेन सम्भूतिशब्देन निर्दिश्यते इत्यर्थः ।  
In the 13th mantra there are two: 'sambhava' and 'asambhava'. There the former was explained as 'kAryabrahma' which corresponds to the term 'vinAsha' in the 14th mantra. There is the word 'asambhava' in the 13th which, therefore, corresponds to the term 'sambhUtim' in the 14th
mantra. He has taken the word in the 4th pAda of the 14th mantra as 'asambhUtyA' alone which corresponds to the word 'asambhava' in the 13th mantra. //
