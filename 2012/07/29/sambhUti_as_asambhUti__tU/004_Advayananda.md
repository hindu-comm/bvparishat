Respected Sri V Subrahmanianji and Sri Narasihmacharyaji,  

Hari Om! Salutations.  
  

Grateful for both your inputs which I found very valuable for my reflection.

  

My basic query is about the padapāṭha of verse 14 of Īśa-upaniṣad, the first word of the first pāda. Does it go as sambhūtim or asambhūtim?

  

While giving his commentary, Śrī Śaṅkarācārya takes the first word of the first pāda as 'asambhūtim'. How doesŚrī Rāmanujācārya and andŚrī Madhvācārya take this word: as 'sambhūtim' or 'asambhūtim'? More importantly what does the padapāṭha of this verse say?

  

In Shri Guru Smriti,  
Advayananda
