Since the tradition is a continuing one there is scope for newer scholars to examine and re-examine past works and give their observations. What an earlier Acharya might have not highlighted, some other points being in his priority, a later one might notice and highlight. I think there is nothing wrong in it.

I had pointed out this very thing in my response to another member.
Shankara at the introduction to the bhashya of the 9th mantra where exactly the upAsana part begins has stated the two-fold teaching of this Upanishad: pravRtti and nivRtti, from the first few mantras as the input. So, all these subsequent mantras about upAsana are, accordingly, not directly leading to moksha. As upasana of the saguNa brahman leads one to other lokas (samsara) and even brahma loka, those upAsya entities were taken as Hiranyagarbha, avyAkRta, etc. and the respective phalams specified as aNimAdi siddhi or prakRti laya. Shankara reiterates the earlier stated agenda of the Upanishad in the introduction to the 15th mantra too which I had copied and presented:  
  
अत्रेदमवधेयम् - १५ तममन्त्रस्यारम्भभाष्ये एवमुक्तं श्रीशंकराचार्यैः - मानुषदैववित्तसाध्यं फलं शास्रलक्षणं प्रकृतिलयान्तम्। एतावती संसारगतिः । अतः परं पूर्वोक्तमात्मैवाभूद्विजानतः इति सर्वात्मभाव एव सर्वैषणासन्न्यासज्ञाननिष्ठाफलम् । *एवं द्विप्रकारः प्रवृत्तिनिवृत्तिलक्षणो वेदार्थोऽत्र प्रकाशितः । तत्र प्रवृत्तिलक्षणस्य वेदार्थस्य विधिप्रतिषेधलक्षणस्य कृत्स्नस्य प्रकाशने प्रवर्ग्यान्तं ब्राह्मणमुपयुक्तम् । निवृत्तिलक्षणस्य वेदार्थस्य प्रकाशनेऽत ऊर्ध्वं बृहदारण्यकमुपयुक्तम् ।*

  
  
इति विभागेन अर्थः प्रदर्शितः भाष्ये । एषा शैलिः कठोपनिषद्यपि दृश्यते । *आद्यद्वयवरविषयः साम्सारिकस्ततः परं तृतीयवरविषय एव पारमार्थिकः मोक्षविषयक इति ।* एवं उपनिषदां शैलिमनुसृत्यैव भाष्यं प्रवर्तते इति न ईषदप्यसामञ्जस्यम् ।

   
  
In the first introduction (mantra 9) Shankara draws attention to the parallel of the same 'vibhAga' in the Brihadaranyaka too by pointing out the one-to-one correspondence in this vibhAga.  
  
If one looks at the complete context one will not find room for objections.  
  
One can see that each of the objections has pointed out to the 'error' or lacuna of the explained word or concept not being found in the original mantra. This is a common feature in all the objections.
Someone said: if the critic understood and appreciated the work the same way the author has, then there will be nothing to criticize. Sometimes there might be understanding and no appreciation. Sometimes even understanding will be missing. In both instances there will be criticism.
