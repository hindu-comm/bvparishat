\> Shankara at the introduction to the bhashya of the 9th mantra where exactly the upAsana part begins has stated the two-fold teaching of this Upanishad: pravRtti and nivRtti, from the first few mantras as the input. So, all these subsequent mantras about upAsana are, accordingly, not directly leading to moksha.  
  

This discussion is going rather afield at this point; I don't see what this has to do with either the objection that reading सम्भूति as असम्भूति is ungrammatical, or that considering सम्भूति and विनाश as creation and destruction leaves open the question of sustenance.  
  
For what it is worth, though, सम्भूत्या अमृतमश्नुते &c. are taken as referring to मोक्ष only (as in Shankara's own explanation of अमृत as मोक्ष in BG II-15 and elsewhere); the reading of अमृतम् as प्रकृतिलयलक्षणम् is non-standard as far as I know. So the dichotomy of saying that verse 14 and others, unlike previous ones, do not talk of मोक्ष would be yet another contentious issue, not a simple matter.
