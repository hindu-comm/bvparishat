Respected Shri Hari Narayana Bhatji,  

Hari Om! Salutations.  
  

Many thanks for your inputs which I am finding very useful. I am thinking on the lines you have suggested. Grateful for your detailed explanation.

The first image you sent is not showing itself....the one wherein you are speaking of Sri Mahidhara's explanation. Without the image, I am having difficulty fully comprehending. Could you please resend it. After going through it, I shall get back to you.

  

I am indeed grateful to the learned explanations of other scholars too.

  

In Shri Guru Smriti,  
Advayananda
