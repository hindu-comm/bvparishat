\>\>\> Respected Sri V Subrahmanianji and Sri Narasihmacharyaji,  
\>\>\> Hari Om! Salutations.  
\>\>\>  
\>\>\> Grateful for both your inputs which I found very valuable for my reflection.  
\>\>\>  
\>\>\> My basic query is about the padapāṭha of verse 14 of Īśa-upaniṣad, the first word of the first pāda. Does it go as sambhūtim or asambhūtim?  
\>\>\>  
\>\>\> While giving his commentary, Śrī Śaṅkarācārya takes the first word of the first pāda as 'asambhūtim'.

\>   
\>\>  
\>\> HariH Om.  
\>\>  
\>\> Yes. I too noticed the explanations on the word असंभूति and संभूति, except the solution to the question specifically you had raised.  
\>  
\>  
\> Sir,  
  
I humbly point out that I did address that particular question raised excepting of course the grammatical explanations of पृषोदरादि etc. which are beyond my knowledge.:  
  
  
  

Thanks for pointing out to your solution of the question and the relevant information therein.  If it is to be taken in the second half,
  
  
असंभूत्या, for the reasons of Prakritilaya, then he suggests that in the first half itself"संभूतिंच विनाशं च"it should be taken as असंभूति asit is readin his commentary and the remaining reasons are clear. If it is for the sake of "sandhi" the "a" is dropped, it should be in theपदपाठalso as असंभूति, which we could not confirm with पदपाठ. So the question is where the अ-कार-प्रश्लेषis suggested, if it is not in the first word संभूति. Now the question is not solved with the support of पदपाठ, but gives raise to another question, where the "a" is to be inserted which was elided in संहिता-पाठ.

In the light of the above alternative explanation, first giving the meaning asसंभूति  
and विनाश, offers the similar explanation probably with retaking that of शाङ्करभाष्य, with अकारप्रश्लेष, in both places of विनाश, as अविनाश, making it mean असंभव, or असंभूति, in conformity with the earlier expression "संभव, असंभव" corresponding to "संभूति. and विनाश" in this verse. The reasoning is the same and as given by Sri Shankara with the same introduction. So probably it is not in the case of संभूति, that "अ" is inserted as understood by Advaitanandaji, but in the word "विनाश" according to Mahidhara. and without splitting as "asambhUtyA" in the second also.

  

This is the view as Mahidhara understood the lines of Sankara. Either he misunderstood the lines or the Editors misunderstood the lines in splitting the sentence. This is the short and long of the issue. This what I said something amiss in the total.

  

Other scholars may have different opinions on these interpretations.

  

Anyhow, this is not any attempt to prove other interpretations by other commentators are wrong or which one is the right one. But only what is raised in question is the doubt in the lines of the commentary in question. Hence better stick to the point raised for discussion so that confusion or misunderstanding by others can be averted in advance.

  

Hope the alternative explanation of Mahidhara is readable from the image pasted and compared with that of Sri Shankara's.

  

With regards
