Namaste.  
  
My guess is that the first word goes as ' सम्भूतिम्' alone. In other words, Shankara has taken it as सम्भूतिम् alone as can be seen in the beginning of the bhashyam. He suggests, later, that in keeping with the phalashruti in the 14th mantra for 'asambhUti upAsana' namely: prakRti layaH, one should 'take' the first word of this mantra as 'asambhUti'.
That is why He says: 'a-varNalopena *nirdeshaH* draShTavyaH.' So, according to Him the mantra is doing the ’nirdesha’ of the word asambhUti as 'sambhUti', by doing the the lopa of the letter 'a'.
असम्भूतिरेव अवर्णलोपेन सम्भूतिशब्देन निर्दिश्यते इत्यर्थः ।  
  
In the 13th mantra there are two: 'sambhava' and 'asambhava'. There the former was explained as 'kAryabrahma' which corresponds to the term 'vinAsha' in the 14th mantra. There is the word 'asambhava' in the 13th which, therefore, corresponds to the term 'sambhUtim' in the 14th
mantra. He has taken the word in the 4th pAda of the 14th mantra as 'asambhUtyA' alone which corresponds to the word 'asambhava' in the 13th mantra.  
  
There is no separate vyAkhyaanam in the Anandagiri's gloss. The Editor Sri Subrahmanya Sastri, while giving a footnote mentions:  
  
अत्र व्याकृताव्याकृतोपासनयोः समुच्चयः विधित्सितः । माध्यन्दिनपाठे आदौ अन्धं तमः प्रविशन्ति ये सम्भूतिमुपासते इति मन्त्रत्रयं पठित्वा तदनन्तरम् अन्धम् तमः प्रविशन्ति येऽविद्यामुपासते इद्यादिमन्त्राः पठिताः, तदनुसारेण माण्डूक्यकारिका तद्भाष्यं च प्रवृत्ते । *तत्र च सम्भूतिरित्येव पदच्छेदो नाकारप्रश्लेष:, ....।
