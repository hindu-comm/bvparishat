So the dichotomy of saying that verse 14 and others, unlike previous ones, do not talk of मोक्ष would be yet another contentious issue, not a simple matter.

It is of course quite well known that अमृत has other meanings -- e.g., literally a "substance" described in Purana-s that confers immortality, or used for comparison to denote something of great value, as in यत्तदग्रे विषमिव परिणामे अमृतोपमम् (BG XVIII-37). However, that is not relevant here -- the reading of अमृतम् as प्रकृतिलयलक्षणम् \*in mantra 14\*, which is the current context, is non-standard (not followed by all commentators) as far as I know. So one has some distance to cover before one can argue for universal acceptance that मोक्ष is not a topic seen in verses 9 and later.  
  
This will be last posting on this topic.
