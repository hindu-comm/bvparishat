Most respected Sri Hari Narayana Bhatji and Sri V.Subramanianji,  

Hari Om! Salutations.  
  

1\. Went through the commentary of Sri Mahidhara whichSri Hari Narayana Bhatjihad attached.It is odd to consider that the fruit of Hiranyagarbhopasana (sambhuti-upasana) as prakritilaya. So far, I have only heard that the ultimate fruit of Hiranyagarbhopasana is Brahmalokaprapti only and never as Prakriti Laya. It will only be logical to consider the fruit of Asambhuti Upasana (related with Karana Brahman) as Prakriti laya. Hence the interpretation of Sri Mahidhara is a little problematic.

2\. Where do I ge the complete commentary of Sri Mahidhara and the other commentary that you were referring to, the Uvata(?) one.

3\. I have been also trying to understand what this Sambhuti Upasana and Asambhuti Upasana is in terms of how it is practiced. Do you have any references in this regard.

  

Once again I express my heartfelt gratitude for all the inputs provided.

  

In Shri Guru Smriti,  
Advayananda
