Respected Scholars,  

Hari Om! Salutations.  
  

This query is with reference to Verse 14 of Īśa Upaniṣad, the first pāda, which goes as: *sambhūtiṁ ca vināśaṁ ca*.

  

Śrī Śaṅkarācārya takes 'sambhūtiṁ' as 'asambhūtim'. This is grammatically valid since the verse 13 ends with the word विचचक्षिरे

Refer to his commentary: "सम्भूतिं च विनाशं च" इत्यत्र अवर्णलोपेन निर्देशः द्रष्टव्यः।

I request for guidance about the padapāṭha in this regard: Does the first word of this verse go asसम्भूतिम् or as असम्भूतिम् in the padapāṭha of the Īśa Upaniṣad?

My heartfelt gratitude for the team of great scholars for the many enlightening discussions in this forum.

  

In Shri Guru Smriti,  
Advayananda
