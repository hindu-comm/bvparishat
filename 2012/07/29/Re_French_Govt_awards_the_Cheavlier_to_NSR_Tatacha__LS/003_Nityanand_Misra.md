Many thanks to all authors for creating English and Samskrita Wikipedia pages. Samskrita Wikipedia needs to grow - it has only 7,00 articles and most of them are one or two lines - and the more Samskrita scholars and scientific writers interested in Samskrita controbute to it, the better. What's good is it there is more activity (e.g. new featured articles, active moderators) on Samskrita Wikipedia as compared to some other Indian languages Wikipedias like Gujarati or Punjabi - Punjabi has only 3,000 articles. I am glad to know that Samskrita Bharati has a Wikipedia Wing too.  
  
Hat tip: While sharing a link for Samsrita Wikipedia, the Unicode title (with dashes replacing space) also works. E.g. for this article  
  
[http://sa.wikipedia.org/wiki/डा।\_एन्\_एस्\_रामानुजताताचार्यः](http://sa.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E0%A4%A1%E0%A4%BE%E0%A5%A4_%E0%A4%8F%E0%A4%A8%E0%A5%8D_%E0%A4%8F%E0%A4%B8%E0%A5%8D_%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%A8%E0%A5%81%E0%A4%9C%E0%A4%A4%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%A4%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%9A%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%AF%E0%A4%83)  
  
is a valid link which is much easier to remember and share than the link with escape sequences (%E0%A4) for Unicode. All browsers convert the Unicode automatically to escape sequences.
