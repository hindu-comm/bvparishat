Please read the 7 part article "Varuna and his decline"

It talks about how the Asura divinity Varuna lost his prominence among the  
followers of Angiras and the rise of Indra in Bharata.

Namaste,  
Dear Samudralwar-ji,  
  
The interpretation is pleasant. ...But it is not in the concordance of Vedic literature. I say so because the explanation of Rudra Vasu and Aditya is very different in the Vedas. Moreover the Gods and Goddesses are 33 in number and not 31! You have added only Vasus Rudras and Adityas and haven't counted Indra and Prajapati! I would have appreciated if you had mentioned two other important parts of the body and equated that with Prajapati and Indra!

Debate between Ithihaasists and historicist is going on for many years resulting in different interpretations by scholars.Historical existance of Hanuman is essential for Ramayana.  
  
Historical evidence of Vidura giving commentary to dhritharashtra on war sitting in a palace will be key to mahabharata. Is it possible to go, search and collect the evidences when huge land masses were submerged and new continents emerged in the past? It is better if we teach our generations the essence of these scriptures which project the happenings in a dharmic society. Even if existence in Hanuman and vidura are not prooved the value of these itihasas will never be be diminshed. Why take the Ittihasaas, Dr Chaterjee based on Lahirimahasayas diaries denies the existance of Babaji the guru popularised by Yogananda. This doesn't diminish the faith in Babaji by his followers. Even if existence of the above figures is proved, will it stop the conversions and onslaught by islamists? The lessons for hindus from above scriptures is simple. Are they prepared to fight if their Sitas and lands are captured?  
  
***4. From: "Arun" \<[macgu...@yahoo.com]()\> :***  
I agree with the general idea of RajeshA, but think that even the expression of the idea requires a great deal of cleaning up. For example,  
  
"The mythology is there to uplift our minds and souls."  
  
What mythology? We are already shooting ourselves in our collective foot if we term it mythology. Call it by its Sanskrit name \[Itihaasa or Purana as the case may be\] and leave it as an untranslatable.  
  
This imaginary dialog that Balu constructs between Wendy Doniger and himself on the issue of Shivalinga illustrates the point.

It begins thus:  
  
"Someone, let's say her name is Wendy Doniger, comes along and sniggers \`when you worship the lingam, you worship a phallus'. I do not identify Wendy's statement as an \`ad hoc' explanation. I say that it trivializes what I am doing by providing a distorted description of what I do. Here is what I say:  
  
"I am doing Puja to Shiva." No discussion about \`Lingam' or its many meanings. This is a wrong way of conducting a discussion. She cannot, therefore, argue that I am giving an \`ad hoc' explanation because I am not giving an \`explanation' of what I am doing but merely describing it.  
  
Let us sketch some scenarios in order to see what conversational moves are there in such a discussion."

Dear \[...\],  
  
Based on Sayana's commentary of the Rig Veda (without specifying the mantra) you have referred to Indra as an 'Asura'. In the absence of a proper reference, it is difficult to know the contextual meaning of a specific Ved mantra and determine whether it falls in the usual category of Asura or as Asu-ra(Devata). Categorisation of asura or devata is done as per reference to the context of a Ved mantra. If it is indicative of giver of benefits to others, it would classify as Devata or Asu-ra and if antagonistic to this sense, it would be Asura.
This is the simple yard stick which I understand as a beginner and as a student of Vedic studies.  
  
I quote here another Mantra pertaining to Indra "Indra tubhyamidadrivo'nuttam vajrin viryam, yaddha tyam mayinam mrgam tamu tvam mayaya-vadhirarcannanu svarajyam.(Rig Veda 1/80/7). Dr.Dilip Vedalankar in his book Vedic Humanism([pub.by](http://pub.by) Govindram Hasanand, Delhi) has translated it as: Oh Brave! You wield the vajra.
You are a potential warrior. You humbled the sinful with tact. You have saved the honour of the honest. By killing the cheats you have respected freedom. Here, the role of Indra being saviour of prana of honest people is that of Asu-ra(Devata) and not that of Asura. In the context of Indra, l would like to add here that the word Indra used in the Veda does not mean the Indra of Puranas. Indira may mean the king, the rich and all those who are known for their power, physical, mental or moral  
  
  
Regarding your point No.7 where you say that Indra defeated Asuras 'living in the city of Harappa' is suggestive of Asuras as a separate racial group inhabiting a particular area. If we assume Asuras as a separate race, then my question to you is whether race of an individual or of a group under usual circumstances changeable? Further, in which sense Rigveda Mantra 6.22.10 exhorts Indra to make Dasyus as Aryas. Obviously, here the connotation is to make wicked people(dasyus) as noble(aryas) since both the terms 'Arya' and 'Dasyu' are qualitative and not racial.  
   
I would like to submit here that Vedic language is multi-dimensional having various shades of meanings, i.e. adhibhautika(social and materialistic), adhidaivika(pertaining to nature) and adhyatmika(spiritual).   
  
To the best of my understanding, we can reach at the exact meaning of a Ved mantra only by going into its etymology and looking at the context. Most of us either refer to the works of Western Indologists or cling to the ritualistic Vedic commentaries of Sayana or sometimes to the controversial works of Mahidhara and Uvata of medieval age when the ancient method of studying and interpreting the Vedas as per ancient guidelines of Nirukta, Brahman Granthas, etc. was almost in disuse in most part of the country. As a result of inappropriate and inaccurate
interpretation, women and shudras were denied of their right to study the Vedas and many other evils like animal sacrifices in yajnas crept in the society. It was Maharishi Dayananda who by reviving ancient methodology of Rishies like that of Acharya Yaska, using it as a sort of weapon for starting his crusade against social evils prevailing in the name of religion.   
  
Taking cue from the ancient Arsha literature of Rishies for Vedic interpretation, he challenged works of Max Muller and the medievial age obscene Vedic commentaries of the orthodoxy in his book Rigvedadi Bhashya Bhumika. That is why in the matter of Vedic interpretation, Sri Aurobindo describes Dayanand as the discoverer of the right clues. Sri Aurobindo further says "Immediately the whole character of the Veda is fixed in the sense Dayananda gave to it, the merely ritual mythological, polytheistic interpretation of Sayana collapses, the merely meterological and naturalistic European interpretation collapses. We have instead a real Scripture, one of the world's sacred books and the devine word of a lofty and noble religion. All the rest of Dayananda's theory arises logically out of this fundamental conception." (Source:
Sri Aurobindo on "Bankim-Tilak-Dayananda" published by Sri Aurobindo Ashram, Pondicherry, Ist ed.1940, 6th Ed.2006.)
