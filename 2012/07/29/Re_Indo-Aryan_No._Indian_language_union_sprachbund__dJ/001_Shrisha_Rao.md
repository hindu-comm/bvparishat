\> In my view, a melting of the glaciers that separate the 'invasionists' and 'indigenists' can occur if an agreement can be reached on the nature of the Indian language union (sprachbund) ca. 3500 BCE. The links provided at the above-mentioned blogpost do NOT include discussions on the Indian sprachbund.  
  

In this regard, see the recent paper "Indus writing is multilingual: a part-syllabic system at work":  
  
<http://www.currentscience.ac.in/Volumes/103/02/0147.pdf>  
  
This paper is probably not the last word on the subject, but it may have some insights of interest.
