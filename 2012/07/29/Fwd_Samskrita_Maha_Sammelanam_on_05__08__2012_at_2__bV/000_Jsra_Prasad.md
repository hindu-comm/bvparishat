Dear Samskrit loving friends,  
  
namaH. This year, Samskrit Week celebrations are from 30/07/12 to 05/08/12.  
We request you all to celebrate Samskrit Week in whichever way feasible. In  
all educational institutions, we could have or facilitate at least one-hour  
programme on anyday during this week. You can include cultural programmes  
(entirely using Samskrit language) and messages by school management or  
pandits nearby highlighting the importance of Samskrit. These messages  
could be in a language suitable for the participants.  
  
In organizations other than educational institutions, we could celebrate  
this week in a number of simple ways. For example, we could prominently  
display a saying by a famous personality about Samskrit and its importance.  
During lunch break, we could chant a few slokas from Bhagavadgita or  
Ramayan during these 7 days. For your convenience, I am enclosing a file of  
some famous quotations by eminent personalities.  
  
On 05/08/2012 Sunday, Samskrita Parirakshana Samiti (an umbrella  
organization of which Samskrita Bharati is a member) planning a grand  
programme in support of Samskritam from 2pm onwards at Keshava Memorial  
School, Narayanaguda, Hyderabad. We at Samskrita Bharati feel that it is  
important to show our love for this language and our heritage by  
attending this programme with friends and other wellwishers of Samskrit.  
While invitations can be collected from our office in Badi Chowdi, I have  
typed out the details in English for your convenience and sharing with  
friends and am enclosing it here. Samskrita Parirakshana Samiti needs all  
kinds of support for this grand function. Please feel to contace me of  
better still Shri Ramanarayana (87127 87217).  
  
We look forward to meeting you at the function,  
With kind regards,  
Krupalu
