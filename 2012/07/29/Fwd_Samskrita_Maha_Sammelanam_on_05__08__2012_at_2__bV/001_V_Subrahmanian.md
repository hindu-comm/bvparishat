Dear Samskrit loving friends,



namaH. This year, Samskrit Week celebrations are from 30/07/12 to 05/08/12. We request you all to celebrate SamskritWeek in whichever way feasible. In all educational institutions, we could have or facilitate at least one-hour programme on anyday during this week. You can include cultural programmes (entirely using Samskrit language) and messages by school management or pandits nearby highlighting the importance of Samskrit. These messages could be in a language suitablefor the participants.



In organizations other than educational institutions, we could celebrate this week in a number of simple ways. For example, we could prominently display a saying by a famous personality about Samskrit and its importance. During lunch break, we could chant a few slokas from Bhagavadgita or Ramayan during these 7 days. For your convenience, I am enclosing a file of some famous quotations by eminent personalities.



On 05/08/2012 Sunday,Samskrita Parirakshana Samiti (anumbrella organization of which Samskrita Bharati is a member)planning a grand programme in support of Samskritam from 2pm onwards at Keshava Memorial School, Narayanaguda, Hyderabad. We at Samskrita Bharati feel that it is important to show our love for this language and our heritage by attendingthis programmewith friends and other wellwishers of Samskrit. While invitations can be collected from our office in Badi Chowdi, I have typed out the details in English for your convenience and sharing with friends and am enclosing it here. Samskrita Parirakshana Samiti needs all kinds of support for this grand function. Please feel to contace me of better still Shri Ramanarayana (87127 87217).



We look forward to meeting you at the function,

With kind regards,

Krupalu

Secretary, Samskrita Bharati, Hyderabad
