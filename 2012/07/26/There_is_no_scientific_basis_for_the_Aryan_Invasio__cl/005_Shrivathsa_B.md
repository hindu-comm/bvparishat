hariH OM,  
  
"I summarize part of a [mAnasataraMgiNI](http://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2012/07/09/nishada-s-and-shabara-s-of-jambudvipa-what-you-see-is-what-it-is/) blog post (whose author is a professional geneticist besides being a highly versed shrautin):"  
 One would like to know the name of the professional geneticist and his publications. One would also like to know how many shrauta yaagas he has participated in and what is his qualification vis-a-vis Veda.  
  
"Some people claim that the migration was an invasion on rather flimsy grounds, while other Hindu/ Indian reactionary nationalists posit absurd "out of India" theories in their attempt to reconcile evidence. The portrayal of this migration as some sort of a negative event is combined with misinformation and used as a political tool by Dravidian politicians, communists, missionaries etc.. Rather, it was a positive event with the heathen cultural ideal "kR^iNvanto vishvam AryaM", which involved development of symbiotic relationships."  
 Seems like a case of "physician, heal thyself". He is guilty of the crime he is attributing to the "reactionary nationalists", Dravidian politicians, communists missionaries etc. i.e. he seeks to reconcile evidence using "kR^iNvanto vishvam Aryam". Moreover, what is the place of communist-coined swear words like "reactionary" etc. in a "scholarly" post? secondly, it seems as though being a "nationalist" is a crime by itself.  
  
"Genetic, linguistic and textual evidence indicates that culturally Indo-Aryan people entered and mixed with natives of mixed genetically "proto-Indian" people around the Indus Valley civilization, forming a hybrid people around 5000-4000 years ago. Around 3500 years ago, this hybrid penetrated the subcontinent reaching mahArAShTra. In the meantime, they met, merged with and culturally influenced Dravidian language speakers who then expanded in to peninsular India, mixing and linguistically dominating with proto-Indian tribes."  
 wow! what is the "linguistic and textual evidence", may one know? Secondly, "dominating" is part of "kR^iNvanto vishvam Aryam" is it? What does "linguistically dominating" mean?  
  
svasti,  
 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,
