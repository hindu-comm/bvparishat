Thanks Professor Rao, for sending the article.  
  
It is an interesting one to go through. I would like to share a few words on this article.  
One method of historical recordings could be the mentioning of the appearance of certain particular constellations when the practices like Agnicayana are performed. Mathematical and metallurgical evidences certainly boost the proof of evidence. It is quite clear that no citi is possible without any Samhitā from which the mantras are inherited or any Brāhmaṇa which guides the appropriate practices in order, as both work collaboratively. There would have been certain pretexts from the people like Witzel, as we read the quote: ‘‘there was no Agnicayana yet at the time of RV’’ (p. 70). Such statements could be pre-planned with a view to attempting for creating an invasion theory. It is clear that the concept of ‘‘mantrabrāhmaṇayorvedaḥ’’ is not been taken into consideration. It is to learn from the paper that the westerners do not want to suggest the Vedic ritual practices beyond the pre-Old-Babylonian (i.e. pre-1700 BC). The pretext is clear from Witzel (p. 67) as he states: ‘‘For, the first appearance of iron, the “black metal” (kṛṣṇa/śyāma ayas) in S. Asia, well known to the Brāhmaṇa style texts, is only at c. 1200 BCE. But, iron is already found in texts much earlier than the Brāhmaṇas (i.e. AV, and in the YV Saṃhitās: MS, KS, TS; however, not yet in the RV)... To date Brāhmaṇa texts at 1900 BCE is simply impossible.’’ But we see that the archaeological discoveries in different times are not consistent. The author of the paper does not quote adequate mantras from the Samhitās and the Brāhmaṇas to establish the usage of kṛṣṇa/śyāma ayas, which could have given an emphatic clarification in refuting the invasion claims. The term ‘‘kṛṣṇa’’ in neuter gender itself represent ‘‘loha’’ or iron according to the lexicon of Jaṭādhara, which is derived from the root ‘‘kṛṣ’’ meaning ‘‘varṇa’’ i.e. colour, and with a suffix ‘‘nak’’, which changes into ‘‘ṇa’’. Regarding the smelting: It is a form of extractive metallurgy; its main use is to produce a metal from its ore. This includes production of silver, iron, copper and other base metals from their ores. Smelting uses heat and a chemical reducing agent to decompose the ore, driving off other elements as gasses or slag and leaving just the metal behind. When the small gold bricks are available for the Sāvitracayana, then smelting process should have known at least to the contemporary period of different cities. The picture of the śyenavedi, the eagle shaped altar directed to east where the constellations of Kṛttikā expected is not well explanatory. The exact degrees or the sun-diameters of “Heaven’’ expected also should have explained to tackle the later theory of bringing further near 800 B.C. And that could have more justified the author's statement: “Even if accepted, it shifts dates of astronomical references from 3000 BC to 2300 BC and not to 800 BC.’’ Or it could be beyond my capacity to read in between the lines of the author. Thank you very much.
