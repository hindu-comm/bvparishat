Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



If one performs PradakshinA to Shiva Linga, he sees Shiva Linga all time. Those who would like to challenge AIT or AMT are doing PradakshinA within the borders of the sub-continent, so they what is available to them in sub-continent. If they dare to enter outside their PradakshinA path and enter Afghanistan, they will see different picture.I discussed this issue many times before on bvparishat. I do not believe AIT or AMT. I am simply requesting those interested in this topic to go to libraries and see the ancient history of countries to the west of the subcontinent.Then write here so we can have dialog. After all we all would like to grow in our knowledge.



Genetics- I do not know genetics. This is I know. In the known history after 500 BCGreeks,Sakas, Mongols, Hunas, Kushanas, Persians, Arabs, Turkish, Europeans, Ethiopians, Somalians have entered India by thousands and thousands. One finds genetic diseases of Greeks in some Gujarathis. So when we talk about genetic evidence, which sample is taken-of what time period, living or dead peoples' genes since Genetics is new science? I am puzzled. If somebody clarifies this situation, it will remove my ignorance.Thanks. N.R.Joshi
