H index of an anonymous person being 40? Is it that you know this person and he has asked you to keep his name secret?  
How come you claimed that he was a shrauta vidvaan in case you know nothing about his knowledge of veda and shrauta?  
  
Why use communist swear words of "reactionary" etc. in a scholarly forum? One could have just examined the merit of the arguments and left it at that (just a friendly suggestion, nothing more).  
  
"faithfully summarise", "current state of knowledge" etc. are the ones which were in question.  
  
Moreover, this classification of languages as "dravidian", "indo aryan" etc. are themselves so colonial in their construct that the theories etc. which proceed from such a classification is "pUrvagraha grasta". For me, in my limited knowledge of languages, all the southern Indian languages are so samskR^itabhUyiShTha that i refuse to recognize them as any separate group.
