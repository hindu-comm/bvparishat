The quest for 'Truth' is always laudable. The efforts of scientists to prove or disprove something is a constant endeavor. Yet, there will be no finality with reference to the matters of the world. More findings will throw up challenges for even more quests. That has been the experience of scientists so far.  
  
Bhagavan in the Gita has said:  
  
*नान्तोऽस्ति मम दिव्यानां* विभूतीनां परन्तप । एष तूद्देशतः प्रोक्तो विभूतेर्विस्तरो मया ॥ ४० ॥  
  
Sanskrit commentary by Sri Sankaracharya  
-- न अन्तः अस्ति मम दिव्यानां विभूतीनां विस्तराणां परंतप। *न हि ईश्वरस्य सर्वात्मनः दिव्यानां विभूतीनाम् इयत्ता शक्या वक्तुं ज्ञातुं वा केनचित्।* एष तु उद्देशतः एकदेशेन प्रोक्तः विभूतेः विस्तरः मया। ।।10.40।।  
  
English translation by Swami Gambhirananda (on Sri Sankaracharya's Sanskrit Commentary)  
10.40 Parantapa, O destroyer of enemies; asti, there is; na, no; antah, limit; to mama, My; divyanam, divine; vibhutinam, manifestations. Indeed, it is not possible for anyone to speak or know of the limit of the divine manifestations of the of the all-pervading God. Esah, this; vistarah, description; vibhuteh, of (My) manifestations; tu, however; prokatah, has been stated; maya, by Me; uddesatah, by way of illustration, partially.  
  
That is why Swami Vidyaranya has said in the Panchadashi:  
  
*निरूपयितुमारब्धे*  निखिलैरपि पण्डितै: । अज्ञानं पुरतस्तेषां भाति कक्ष्यासु कासुचित् ॥ \[6.143\]. 143. Even if all the learned people of the world try to determine the nature of this world, they will find themselves confronted at some stage or other by ignorance.
