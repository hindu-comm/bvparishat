Usually genetics looks at haplogroups on the the Y-chromosome or on the mitochondrial DNA or to trace ancestry. Even though the interpretations may differ – people have used genetics to both support or oppose the AIT/AMT, these two methods are foolproof with very low margin of error as explained below.



Every male has 22 pairs of chromosomes + XY. Between the 22 pairs, gene-crossing can occur. But gene crossing cannot occur between X and Y as they are not homogenous chromosomes. Moreover, the ovum from the mother has only X-chromosome and not Y. As a result, haplogroups on the Y-chromosome in a male are only from the father and can be used to trace the unbroken paternal lineage (father’s father’s father’s …. father – or what we call*gotra*) with near perfection – except for the rare case of genetic mutation.



Similar is the case for mitochondrial DNA. The zygote gets the nuclear DNA from the fusion of the sperm nucleus and the ovum nucleus. But the mitochondrial DNA is only from the ovum of the mother since the sperm does not have any mitochondria. As a result, the haplogroups on the mitochondrial DNA in both males and females are only from the mother and can be used to trace the unbroken maternal lineage (mother’s mother’s mother’s …. mother) with near perfection – except for the rare case of genetic mutation.



The arrival of Greeks, Shakas, Kushanas, and the like has resulted in genetic and racial admixture no doubt, but over a large sample size, the study of unbroken paternal and maternal lineages using the mtDNA and Y haplogroups is a powerful tool to study origins of gene pool populations.
