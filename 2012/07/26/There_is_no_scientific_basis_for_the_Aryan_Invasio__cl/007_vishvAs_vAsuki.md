नमस्ते । If he did not mind being non-anonymous, he would sign his posts with his name; so I will not presume to intervene. As to his qualifications as a geneticist, suffice it to say that his [H-index](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index) is in the mid 40's. I don't know numbers pertaining to his yaaga-rate etc..

Please forgive me - "reactionary nationalists" etc.. were my words. I did not mean to imply that being nationalist is a crime. I consider myself a hindu nationalist. The post should be judged by its own words. I do not claim that it is a scholarly article, it is a blog post which I take to faithfully summarize the current state of knowledge with some educated speculation by a very astute mind. The post was linked in my email.  
  

>  wow! what is the "linguistic and textual evidence", may one know?

One would consider similarities and differences among languages used by different groups of people within and without India. More below.

  
  
As to textual evidence, I must plead ignorance. You may find details in the linked blog-posts.  


> Secondly, "dominating" is part of "kR^iNvanto vishvam Aryam" is it?

I did not say that. Neither do I say that it is not.  


> What does "linguistically dominating" mean?
