Dear Sirs,  
  
Thanks for the pictures which are perhaps taken form the book of Sri P. Appa Rao's translation of NaaTyaSaastra, the best one according to me in Indian languages. However, I feel that these are originally done for the Kannada work of Sri Kaushik (bharatanaaTya-digdarSana). Here is just a clarification: karaNa-s, the basic units of dance, according to Bharata, are not static postures; they are dynamic dance movements that involve the aesthetic movement of the whole body(ref: hastapaadasamaayOgat nRttasya karaNaM bhavEt). Here hasta mean the nRttahasta-s which are 30 in number, paada mean the 16 aakaaSiki and 16 bhaumi caari-s and these are essentially movements. To this, the nine postures, the sthaanaka-s or the static postures are combined and totally 108 maarga-karaNa-s are created (There are 36 dEsi karaNa-s according to the later works such as samgeetaratnaakara, nRttaratnaavali, nRtyaadhyaaya etc).  
  
Those who are interested in the nuances of naaTyaSaastric karaNa-s Dr Padmaa Subrahmanyam's magnum opus "karana-s the basic dance units of India and Indonesia" can be of great use. This three-volume-work is both photographic illustrations, sculptural illustrations and total reconstruction of the karaNa-s.  
  
regards
