Thank you Sir,

This is an excellent book . I had obtained a copy and read it a few years back.

Dr Nene's interpretation of Soma in Vedas perfectly matched the description of Soma in Vedas.

When seeking your guidance I was wondering if you have made any study of Veda Sooktas that can be understood better by keeping Dr Nene's interpretation in mind.

My way of studying Soma is entirely different accordingly

Soma in Vedas refers to knowledge that is derived after deep research on on physio socialworld particularly and then that knowledge propels the individual and his mind to greater heights of success.
