The subject of the Saabdabodha has been under discussion in many a number of texts for at least a dozen of centuries which deals with Indian systems of logic. One can enjoy them, if interested, from the Saabdakhanda sections of Kaarikaavalii, Muktaavalii, Dinakarii and Raamarudrii etc. The Tattvacintaamani of Gangesopaadhyaaya and commentaries to that etc. etc. also discuss the Saabdabodha in detail. The Grammarians, Mimamskas etc. were also in search of meaning perception in their own system of interpretation. Whether one is a beginner or well trained for decades, it does not matter if you keep an interest in listening to the elders who are dedicated to the Indian sastras at least for six to seven decades and who are ready to convey their knowledge through a public venue. To the best of my very very limited knowledge, I see the usages like "gangaayaam ghoshah", "peeno devadattah"etc. many a number of times in many texts of grammarians, logicians etc. These things are repeated for conveying knowledge in many a number assemblies of learned called the "vidvatsads" or the "vaakyaarthasabhas". And, remember, man, we have to develop a culture if we lack it to listen to the elders who convey the saastric knowledge. There are many a number of beginners who love to listen to the eminent and profound scholarship of Professor Narasimhacharya, whether he takes the ditto from any printed or unprinted. So, no need of frustration. We will listen to him so long as he advices us. If one is not interested then he can ignore the mails too. Best of luck!!!!
