hariH OM,  
humble salutations at the feet of vidvAns,  
  
 I found this expression in viShNupurANa:  
यत्रोतमेतत्प्रोतम्  
 I have come across the expression ओत - प्रोत in kannaDa. I want to know the reason why:  
प्र + ओत doesn't become प्रौत?  
यत्र + ओत doesn't become यत्रौत?  
  
 I will be extremely grateful to receive your replies.  
  
svasti,  
 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,  

shrivathsa.
