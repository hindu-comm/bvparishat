Dear scholars,  
  
Prof. Prasanna, the author of the paper I had forwarded previously  
(<http://www.currentscience.ac.in/Volumes/103/02/0216.pdf>) has made the  
following response to Dr. Narayanan's comments posted to BVP. I would  
like to suggest that he be kept in the loop in case of any further  
discussion of the paper.  
  
Regards,  
  
Shrisha Rao

My response follows. It is more in the nature of a clarification of  
the motivation and scope of my  
work.  
  
  
The main motivation of the paper was to discuss the evidences any physical  
scientist should consider in order to form an professional opinion on AIT.  
In my opinion these would be from astronomy, mathematics and metallurgy.  
It is important not to lose sight of this motivation. My response is  
inserted at appropriate places in the comments.

\> Thanks Professor Rao, for sending the article.  
\>  
\> It is an interesting one to go through. I would like to share a few  
words on this article.  
\> One method of historical recordings could be the mentioning of the  
appearance of certain particular constellations when the practices like  
Agnicayana are performed. Mathematical and metallurgical  
\> evidences certainly boost the proof of evidence. It is quite clear that  
no citi is possible without any Samhitā from which the mantras are  
inherited or any Brāhmaṇa which guides the appropriate practices in order,  
as both work collaboratively. There would have been certain pretexts from  
the people like Witzel, as we read the quote: ‘‘there was no Agnicayana  
yet at the time of RV’’ (p. 70). Such statements could be pre-planned with  
a view to attempting for creating an  
\> invasion theory. It is clear that the concept of  
\> ‘‘mantrabrāhmaṇayorvedaḥ’’ is not been taken into consideration. It is  
to learn from the paper that the westerners do not want to suggest the  
Vedic ritual practices beyond the pre-Old-Babylonian (i.e. pre-1700 BC).  
The pretext is clear from Witzel (p. 67) as he states: ‘‘For, the first  
appearance of iron, the “black metal” (kṛṣṇa/śyāma ayas) in S. Asia, well  
known to the Brāhmaṇa style texts, is only at c. 1200 BCE. But, iron is  
already found in texts much earlier than the Brāhmaṇas (i.e. AV, and in  
the YV Saṃhitās: MS, KS, TS; however, not yet in the RV)... To date  
Brāhmaṇa texts at 1900 BCE is simply impossible.’’ But we see that the  
archaeological discoveries in different times are not consistent.  
  
My response is unnecessary.  
  
\> The author of the paper does not quote adequate mantras  
\> from the Samhitās and the Brāhmaṇas to establish the usage of  
kṛṣṇa/śyāma ayas, which could have given an emphatic clarification in  
refuting the invasion claims. The term ‘‘kṛṣṇa’’ in neuter gender itself  
represent ‘‘loha’’ or iron according to the lexicon of Jaṭādhara, which is  
derived from the root ‘‘kṛṣ’’ meaning ‘‘varṇa’’ i.e. colour, and with a  
suffix ‘‘nak’’, which changes into ‘‘ṇa’’.  
  
  
First of all, this would be well beyond my expertise. Secondly, even if I  
had given the above mentioned interpretation, I do not see how it would  
convince other scientists of my professional competence in this matter.  
Indeed, this issue lies in the professional realm of Sanskrit scholars and  
it is their view that is important. In this regard, I have mentioned in  
the article that, as seen from Vedic Index, even 19th century western  
Sanskrit scholars were tentative in the interpretation of krsna/syama  
ayas. I then give evidence that even now Sanskrit scholars are not in  
agreement on its interpretation.  
  
  
\> Regarding the smelting: It is a form of extractive metallurgy; its main  
use is to produce a metal from its ore. This includes production of  
silver, iron, copper and other base metals from their ores.  
\> Smelting uses heat and a chemical reducing agent to decompose the ore,  
driving off other elements as gasses or slag and leaving just the metal  
behind. When the small gold bricks are available for the  
\> Sāvitracayana, then smelting process should have known at least to the  
contemporary period of different cities.  
  
  
The other related issue is to the archaeological evidences of Iron, in  
which I have cited the views of archaeologists. It is clear that  
archaeologists no longer consider the equating of krsna/syama ayas with  
Iron Age seriously.  
  
My own independent view on the issue of krsna/syama ayas is limited to  
pointing out that there are no verses that are amenable to scientific  
(metallurgical) analysis. Anything more on my part on this issue, I  
believe, would not carry professional credibility.  
  
It is of utmost importance to read the IJHS paper (ref.14), where I have  
discussed astronomical references in detail. In this paper, I briefly  
mention them and frequently refer to the IJHS paper. Unfortunately, the  
comments on astronomical issues suggest the detailed IJHS paper may not  
have been consulted.  
  
\> The picture of the śyenavedi, the eagle shaped altar directed to east where the constellations of  
\> Kṛttikā expected is not well explanatory.  
  
  
In this context, not only in the text, but even in the figure caption I  
refer to the IJHS paper. Page 588-589 of the IJHS paper clearly explains  
this issue.  
  
  
\>The exact degrees or the  
\> sun-diameters of “Heaven’’ expected also should have explained to tackle  
the later theory of bringing further near 800 B.C.  
  
  
I felt that it would be too detailed in the context of the purpose of the  
article. This can be obtained from standard formulas available e.g. in  
Indian Astronomy, An Introduction, by S. Balachandra Rao.  
  
  
\>And that  
\> could have more justified the author's statement: “Even if accepted, it  
shifts dates of astronomical references from 3000 BC to 2300 BC and not to  
800 BC.’’ Or it could be beyond my capacity to read in between the lines  
of the author.  
  
  
Unfortunately, two separate issues have been mixed up. This issue is  
concerned with Pingree’s suggestion, made without any scientific  
justification, of a 10-day error in the determination of winter solstice.  
I have clearly mentioned in the article that in the IJHS paper it is shown  
to be incorrect. KB 19.3 and SB 11.1.1.7 together lead to 3000 BC. Hence  
the comment that even if Pingree’s error estimates were accepted it would  
only lead to 2300 BC for KB 19.3 and not to 800 BC. It is not related to  
Krittika deviating from true east or to Agnicayana at all.  
  
\>Thank you very much.  
\>  
\> Regards,  
\> Narayanan  
  
  
More generally, I would like to take this opportunity to again stress that  
point that Krittika on true east is not the most important astronomical  
reference. As stated briefly in the text and discussed in detail in the  
IJHS paper, verses on ekastaka, KB 19.3 and Mahasivaratri all point to  
amanta Magha new-moon at winter solstice. It leads to 3000 BC. This is the  
most important and robust astronomical reference. This is especially the  
case since there is complete agreement in the interpretation of ekastaka  
among ancient Sutra commentators (p-580 ff of IJHS paper), western  
Sanskrit scholars and scientists.  
  
One must emphasise areas where all scholars are in complete agreement over  
areas where there are differing views. Thus, Krittika being on true east  
(which was first suggested by Dikshit in 1895 and to which I have given  
independent confirmation (IJHS paper)) must be seen in the background of  
ekastaka, KB 19.3 plus SB 11.1.1.7 and Mahasivaratri all of which lead to  
3000 BC.  
  
There is no need to convince Sanskrit scholars who may interpret Krittika  
on true east to 800 BC on dubious grounds even as they interpret ekastaka  
and KB 19.3 to 3000 BC. Rather it is they who need to explain why they  
interpret ekastaka, KB 19.3 and Mahasivaratri to 3000 BC (all of which  
they consider contemporary to the Vedic texts) if they subscribe to AIT.  
Indeed, every scholar or layman interested in ancient Indian history must  
know that western Sanskrit scholars have dated ekastaka to 3000 BC for the  
last 80 years and there is no possibility of reinterpreting it to 800 BC.  
This essential fact must be addressed before forming an opinion in favour  
of AIT. From a scientific perspective, this and other astronomical  
references imply that AIT stands disproved.  
  
  
Thanks and best regards  
T.R.S. Prasanna
