 This is nothing new. In fact it is like beating a dead horse.



 David Frawley and I have been highlighting the unscientific nature of AIT for 20 years. I (Rajaram) in my book *Search for the Historical krishna* highlighted the evidence of winter solstice and the Mahashivaratri. I supported it further with data from Ashwalayana and his teacher Kaushitaki.



Later, in Supplement 3 of our book *Vedic Aryans* Frawley and I discussed genetic evidence demolishing the AIT. This is now considered so definitive that even die hard AIT-wallahs like Thapar and Witzel have adopted subterfuges saying they don't believe in AIT but AMT.



 Let us move on to something new instead of keep beating a dead horse.
