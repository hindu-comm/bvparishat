It is a matter of perspective. The AIT unfortunately lives on in textbooks (including those of the NCERT, which is more seized of decades-old political cartoons and such needless controversies, rather than accuracy of content) and other places, so it can hardly be described as dead. Even the AMT is a sort of प्रच्छन्न-AIT, for aficionados who wish to retain the AIT's conclusions whilst not having to answer for its weaknesses.  
  
Even if criticisms of the AIT have been presented before, it is important that it be refuted by mainstream scientists writing in mainstream journals, for wider acceptance. It is hardly likely that a book like "Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science" would include the AIT among the theories criticized (if the late Martin Gardner were to rewrite it today), without these. Though all must agree that truth should not be determined solely by social standing, there is a saying in Kannada, ಶಂಖದಿಂದ ಬಂದಿದ್ದು ತೀಥರ್ -- "\[water\] coming from a शङ्ख is तीर्थ \[and not any other water\]," which unfortunately is very true in academic circles. So I suppose one could say लोकसङ्ग्रहमेवापि सम्पश्यन् कर्तुमर्हसि or perhaps ऋतं च स्वाध्याय प्रवचने च, in respect of such writings.
