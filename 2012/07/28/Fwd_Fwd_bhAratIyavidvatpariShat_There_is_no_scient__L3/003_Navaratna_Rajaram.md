 Progress is being made both within and outside India. But requires credible scholars with academic standing to go and confront AIT propagandists in scholarly garb. Unfortunately 'nationalist' organizations have failed to produce credible thinkers, speakers and writers. So the burden has fallen on a few of us with academic standing but for whom this cannot be the highest priority.



 We must destroy Indology. It is a colonial construct that has outlived its usefulness. It has contributed nothing to our understanding of the past but remains an obstruction. Its main function now is to provide a livelihood (and academic respectability) for Western 'scholars' who covertly (like Edwin Bryant) or overtly (like Steve Farmer and Witzel) want to control the agenda and decide when a result is valid.



 To take an example, Bryant has claimed to the effect that only the decipherment and reading of the Harappan writing and language will determine the future course of research. To quote:



 "..it will only be the decipherment of thescript that will prove decisive in this whole issue to the satisfaction of most scholars,since the recent discovery suggests that the script could go back to 3500 BCE (providing, of course, that it encapsulates the same language throughout). If it turns out to be a language other than Indo-Aryan, then obviously the Indigenist position need no longer detain the consideration of Indologists or serious scholarsof ancient history. In my opinion, this eventuality will be the only development that will convince a large number of scholars that the Aryans were, indeed, immigrants into India." .... blah,blah, blah and more blah.



 Who will have the decisive vote on this? Bryant and his fellow Western Indologists of course. Will they accept a result that is adverse to their position not to say to their careers? Never. So they will keep the 'debate' going expecting people like us to participate but under the rules set by them and they having the final say on conclusions.



 As Shankaracharya said long ago-- *udaranimittam bahukruta vesham.*



** I have been in this game longer than most and fought them also longer than most. Don't waste time understanding and/or refuting them, that only gives them visibility and makes them seem relevant. Nobody but us reads all this anyway.



 So ignore and demolish them by any means-- make the irrelevant.
