Can you please specify the Nirukta of the words either by Yaska or any other lexicon based for your interpretation? This would facilitate to assess the genuineness of the interpretation.

  

Also please use Unicode Devanagari fonts, otherwise it will be read with crosses and slashes making it difficult to see the Devanagari characters.

  

With regards
