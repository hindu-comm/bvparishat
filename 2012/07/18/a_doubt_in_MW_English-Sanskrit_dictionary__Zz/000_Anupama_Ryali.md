Dear Scholars,  
  
The third meaning of the word 'Favoritism' in Sanskrit, in Monier Williams English-Sanskrit Dictionary is not clear due to lack of clarity in it's print. Can any one give me it's correct form? Is there any possibility of it to be 'पक्षोद्वाहित्वं' ?  
Please find attached the scanned copy.
