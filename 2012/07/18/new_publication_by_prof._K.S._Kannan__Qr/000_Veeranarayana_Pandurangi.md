आयुर्वेदीयपदार्थविज्ञानम् theoritical foundations of Ayurveda, Text book of Ayurveda (as per BAMS Syllabus)

By Vidyanidhi K.S.Kannan,

I-AIM CTF Publicaition series. 4, Bangalore. 2011.

Institute of Ayurveda and Integrative medicine, (I-AIM). Foundation for revitalisasion of local health traditions (FRLHT)

For long आयुर्वेदीयपदार्थविज्ञानम् text constituted of parts of charakasamhita etc. on theoritical foundations of Ayurveda, proved to be difficult for the students of ayurveda without shastra background and the inexperienced teachers as well. This difficulti is now fully is got rid by the efforts of Vidyanidhi K.S.Kannan, a profound scholar of sanskrit and english with science background.

This book is divided into three sections on ontology, epistemology and miscellaneous that covers causation, liberation, creation, general descritption of various shastras. But the main content of the book is the ontological theories of vaisheshikas, epistemology of nyaya as adopted by Ayurveda and there is special treatment of the sankhya theoris of prkrti etc. each and every category is explained with the help of tables charts with original sentences quoted in footnotes.

This is the must read book for ayurveda teachers and students alike.

I congradulate prof. Kannan for the hard labour they took for the benefit of the common man.

अथ चेत्त्वमिमं धर्म्यं संग्रामं न करिष्यसि।

ततः स्वधर्मं कीर्तिं च हित्वा पापमवाप्स्यसि।।

तस्मादुत्तिष्ठ कौन्तेय युद्धाय कृतनिश्चयः।

निराशीर्निर्ममो भूत्वा युध्यस्व विगतज्वरः।। (भ.गी.)
