Dear Prof. R. N. Iyengar and other respected scholars,Namaskar!



Dr. R. N.Iyengar, Thank you very much for taking trouble to explain things to me.



My questions on bvparishat in connection with Sanskrit shabdas and their Arthas are directed from the point of view of VarNavAda supported by MImAnsakas. Assuming time of PANini 500 BC, we do not know the development of SAnskrit from hundreds of years before PANini. I am convinced that grammatical changes have taken place in Sanskrit. Please read the three volumes of Yudhis'thira MImAmsaka. Marathi book of Rajawade is even more disturbing. Some scholars think that Sanskrit is DaivI bhAshA. Some think it was developed as link language from other languages of India. You tell me if I want to teach Sanskrit to new generation scientifically oriented, what I am going to tell them? SAnskrit like any other language or DaivI bhAshA? So my attention got focused on VarNavAda. Because I know science of sound (Dhvani), after thinking for a long time, I got idea of connecting periodic acoustic properties to the meanings of VarNAs like /k/ , /kh/, /g/ etc. This scheme works very fine for 36 consonants. Consonants stand out because of their distinct nature. Problem is with vowels, especially with mix vowels like short /ri/, long /RI/, short /li/ and long /LI/. Visarga is very troublesome. What was position of Visarga 1000 years before PANini, I do not know. However when I presented my VarNavAda slides in India, and when I explain meanings of each consonant, audience enjoyed Internal Beauty of Sanskrit words. In short I make Sanskrit interesting without touching grammar. So all my questions are directed towards VarNavAda.

In order to find out the origin of Sanskrit (did it come from PIE-Aryans etc) I went into the ancient history of countries from Afghanistan to Finland. I found many interesting thinks. I discussed them here before. Some findings are disturbing to the patriotic people of India-especially of the Persian Empire of the known history. I am working on both books, Research starts and it never ends. I am praying God to show me the right path. Thanks. N.R.Joshi

Dear Dr.Joshi,

Here is my unscholarlyresponse toyour post. Pardon me.

I have heard of"onomatopoeic words" particularly "pilippila". Perhaps Jharjhara, marmara (english murmur?), काकः,कुक्कुट,डमरु, taTit,
DiNDima, may belong to this class. In such cases theअर्थmay be inherentin theशब्दwhich I take as the 'heard sound' leading tosome type of श्रवणेन्द्रियजन्यज्ञानं . Now if you claim shabda is nitya (=constant, unchanging,eternal, natural) I have no problem in accepting it. But how can meaning be constant? When you talk of संस्कृतं as a language are you referring to the 'spoken one' that Panini concentrated on or the later written textual language? I prefer to have a clear distinction on this since leaving aside the temporal/historical changes is not rational. May be I have not understood you when you bring up the issue of Sanskrit being divine-language. You will have to define 'divine', an unenviable proposition! Nevertheless what I could not follow is with नानार्थकोष being recognized as valid how can there be स्फोट of unique meaning of a isolated written/printed word for a reader (like me) without carrying thecontinuity of the context in the mind?. This is no more श्रवणेन्द्रियजन्य except by स्मरणं.

The changing meaning of technical words in Sanskrit is quite dangerous!

kind regards for thought provoking posts.

RN Iyengar
