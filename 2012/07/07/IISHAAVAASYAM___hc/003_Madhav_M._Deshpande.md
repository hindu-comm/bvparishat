I wonder if anyone has checked the Padapāṭha of the Śukla Yajurveda Saṃhitā to see what kinds of padas are given there. The Padapāṭha should be older than all the available commentaries, and could provide the earliest understanding of this phrase. I don't have access to this Padapāṭha at the moment.
