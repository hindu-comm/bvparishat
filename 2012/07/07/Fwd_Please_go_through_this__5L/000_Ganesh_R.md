Dear all,  
  
This is a very interesting and informative article. It's insights too, at places are not worthy. The author's deep love for classical learning is commendable. But I feel, in spite of all these laudable qualities, that the author's priorities and honesty are doubtful. Especially he
giving a bounty of appreciation to D. R. Nagaraj, who knew neither classical Kannada nor Sanskrit in the way they have to be learnt -- or at least at the level of philology as the author himself often stresses in this paper -- makes any one, who knows both the classical bearing of these languages and the pathetic emptiness of D.R. Nagaraj couched with his audacity and contempt for true mastery in classical learning, feel the misplaced priorities of the author. In stead of this if he had taken T. V. Venkataachala Shaastry, from whom he learnt classical Kannada, as a striking example of classical learning specially well rooted in philology as he desires, one could have appreciated his concern as a more serous and genuine one. .  
Above all, nowhere he has seen or made a remote, or even an accidental effort to feel the classical languages and their study as a living entity of excitement. As a serious student of several classical languages and their literature I am always for their creative usage. Many of my young friends are also for this. I honestly feel that this aspect was ignored by most of the Indologists and classicists also whom the author quotes here. Thus mere classicality with out such an aesthetically rewarding and creatively enriching employment is some thing like preparing a yUpasthaMbha out of a, say ashwattha, tree but unable to grow even a small sapling of the same. I have discussed these issues in detail in my books BhaaShaabRMgada bennEri and Haasu beesu. Any way, it is a good writing that echoes many of our thoughts in different tones and pitches:-)  
  
Any way, in spite of me having many more observations to make in this regard, I leave it for the better reactions of the learned lore.  
  
  
regards
