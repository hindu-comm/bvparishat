I know the background to this. Pollock's appeal has been making the rounds for quite some time.



 I agree that it is well written and sounds sincere but has an ulterior motive as Sri Ganesh suspects.



 Sheldon Pollock, like all Sanskritists in the Western academiais having trouble getting students and MONEY. So they are using this scare tactics-- "Sanskrit in danger! Indian classical studies in danger!"



 Even Edwin Bryant, a Sanskrit illiterate is getting into the act-- posing as the savior of Sanskrit and Indian classics.



 How to save them? Give them money.And a few like the Infosys people have fallen for it. Pollock is supposed to produce a Great Books Library of Indian Classics funded by the Murtys.



 Harvard, Cambridge U (England), Berlinand many others are shutting down their Indology programs and their faculty are scared. (I have visited most of them and have given lectures.) In Pollock's own words:



 "A look at classical Indian studies in Western Europe offers a good sense of the state of affairs. In the past 30 years, Dutch Indology, the heir of a great tradition, has been decimated, losing all but 2 of 20 positions. In Germany during the same period, at least 11 professorships have been lost entirely or converted to modern South Asian social science; Indian philological studies in Berlin, whose birth (in 1821) was virtually simultaneous with the birth of the university, is expected to be closed in the near future. At Cambridge and Edinburgh, longstanding professorships have been replaced by low-level lectureships, and even these are threatened with elimination. The situation at the College de France today is indicative of the larger picture beyond Indian studies."



 My view is-- good riddance. They served colonial interests and have outlived their usefulness. If we depend on outsiders to save Indian classics, they will turn us into intellectual slaves. Why should we keep these people alive. Their goal is to preserve their moral and intellectual superiority over Indians-- "by saving our culture". Why? Because Hindus are incapable of real, objective scholarship. Witzel is a typical example.



 So if Pollock cannot find Indian scholars to work with it is his problem, not ours. Let he and his tribe disappear into the dustbin of history.



sincerely,
