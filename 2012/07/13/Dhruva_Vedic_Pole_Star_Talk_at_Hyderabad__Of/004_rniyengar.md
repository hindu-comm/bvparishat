Dear Dr. Narayanan,  
Thanks for your further explanation. Your point is well taken. May be  
there is an aquatic animal that dies when its tail is cut.  
  
But, your quote from Kashika seems to hide some special insight, even  
though this is not explicitly clear. Why that part is called  
'adhruvam' that is not 'dhruva'? Is there a play on the word 'Dhruva'?  
In any case if you allow allegories into grammar, the 'celestial  
shishumara' died after 'Dhruva at the tail' was cut off. In other  
words as the original Pole star called Abhaya in Tai Aranyaka (equated  
as Dhruva) shifted from the Celestial Pole, the importance of  
Shishumara constellation to our culture died. But this was the first  
animal figure for identifying a group of stars away from the ecliptic.  
  
Thanks for your question!

\> Respected Sir,  

\> Thanks for the reply. Sorry for using Śiṃśumāra, as you have used Śiśumāra in your paper. Both Śiśumāra and Śiṃśumāra are in use in the meaning of Delphinus Gangeticus (Latin name for dolphin) and porpoise according to MM Williams.  
\> My question was does the animal called Śiśumāra faces death even a limb in the form of the tail is cut off, and if so that tail portion is dhruva. If the animal does not die even if its tail being cut off, then that tail is adhruva; and it is clear from the commentary of the rule स्वाङ्गेऽध्रुवे (3.4.54).  
\> The dolphin has, apart from its function in swimming, the tail flukes also play a role in thermoregulation, like the flippers. The tail flukes contain a number of large blood vessels.  
\> So, I thought Śiśumāra's tail is dhruva, because if its tails flukes are cut it could face its death due to blood loss and thermoirregularity. But the head of not only mammals, but lizards, centipedes could normally be dhruva. Some pseudopodial organisms could be exceptional. But hands and legs of any mammal are adhruva.
