Dear S'riimaan  
You have put a difficult question! I will try to analyse the issue  
raised but this may not be a complete answer for you.  
  
First a minor point. I used the word Śiśumāra and not Śiṃśumāra. But  
this is may not matter.  
  
My animal (figuratively) was celestial. Perhaps you are referring to  
an aquatic animal. The identification of this in modern terms is to  
the best of my knowledge unsettled. Some say Porpoise, others say  
whale,crocodile, alligator or gharial. Is it a sea animal or a  
riverine one? In the RV many have taken this word to mean the Gangetic  
porpoise, whereas Pancavimsabrahmana clearly alludes to location in a  
sea. Hence no special information on wether it dies if any part is cut  
is not known.  
  
But your query is somewhat ambiguous. The cutoff part is 'adhruva'  
becasue the प्राणी म्रियते. But in my case 'Dhruva' was only a part of  
the whole; a fixed star at the tail end. The other stars could rise  
and set. As per the Brahmanda purana, the last four on the tail were  
not setting. That is, a few among the other ten stars could rise and  
set. DO you like to call this as 'cutting a limb'?  
  
As far as I can imagine as per your definition following Kaas'ikaa  
only the 'head' of a mammal (including humans) would be Dhruva!  
Frankly I could not follow your line of thought.  
  
kind regards
