Respected Sir,

I have seen your paper: Dhruva: The Ancient Pole Star published last year (Jan 2011). I make this comment regarding your initial statements:

"Dhruva was a star located at the tail of a celestial animal figure known as the Śiṃśumāra."  

"The body parts of the animal figure are made of fourteen stars, the last four of which including Dhruva on the tail are said to never set."  

The Kashika commentary to the Paninian Rule स्वाङ्गेऽध्रुवे (3.4.54) says that if a creature does not die when any of its limb is cut off, that limb is adhruva.(यस्मिनङ्गे छिन्नेऽपि प्राणी न म्रियते तदध्रुवम्।). When the tails of lizards, snakes etc. are cut, the creatures will still be alive.

Could we not imagine that Śiṃśumāra is an animal which face death if it loose any of its limbs, as it is not an adhruva? Please answer.

Regards,

Narayanan
