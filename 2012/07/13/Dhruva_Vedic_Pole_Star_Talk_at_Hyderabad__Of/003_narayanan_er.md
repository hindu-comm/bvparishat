Respected Sir,

Thanks for the reply. Sorry for using Śiṃśumāra, as you have used Śiśumāra in your paper. Both Śiśumāra and Śiṃśumāra are in use in the meaning of Delphinus Gangeticus (Latin name for dolphin) and porpoise according to MM Williams.

My question was does the animal called Śiśumāra faces death even a limb in the form of the tail is cut off, and if so that tail portion is dhruva. If the animal does not die even if its tail being cut off, then that tail is adhruva; and it is clear from the commentary of the rule स्वाङ्गेऽध्रुवे (3.4.54).

The dolphin has, apart from its function in swimming, the tail flukes also play a role in thermoregulation, like the flippers. The tail flukes contain a number of large blood vessels.

So, I thought Śiśumāra's tail is dhruva, because if its tails flukes are cut it could face its death due to blood loss and thermoirregularity. But the head of not only mammals, but lizards, centipedes could normally be dhruva. Some pseudopodial organisms could be exceptional. But hands and legs of any mammal are adhruva.

Thank you very much Sir.

Regards,

Narayanan
