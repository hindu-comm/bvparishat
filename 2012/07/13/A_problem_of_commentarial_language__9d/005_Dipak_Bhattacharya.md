Esteemed Scholars,

While I thank all the contributors, particularly those who have made illuminative comments on the basic stem of Vedāntadeśika’s *vaiyātya*, most of them have focused on the correctness or otherwise of *vaiyatyaya* while my question was about the curreny of its usage. Unless absolutely necessary I prefer avoiding grammatically defensible words which are of very rare usage. They create problem for those who have to read for the sake of the contents instead of for *sāhityavilāsa*. There cannot be anything against *sāhityavilāsa*, but in case of the explanation of rare Vedic words, which became obsolete in Classical Sanskrit, quick comprehension from the commentary is essential. This context cannot be ignored with commentarial literature on the Vedas. Beginning from the Śatapatha-Brāhmaṇa up to Satyavrata Sāmaśramin and Dayananda Sarasvati every commentator on Vedic words has tried to make things easier without embellishment of language or tortuous defence.

Since my context was the Vedas, the Paippalāda-Samhitā of the Atharvaveda in particular, the meaning "Though not conforming to rules this word has to be accepted" has to be conveyed. *Prāmādika* does not convey this meaning. Later commentators outright reject Classical Sanskrit forms like *prabhraṃśayāṃ yo nahuṣaṃ cakāra* or *viśrāmaṃ labhatām idaṃ ca* *śithila-* etc or tortuously defend *vismāpayan vismitam* etc. No such rejection is possible for a Vedic word nor a tortuous defence. We have to accept deviations as such ie as Vedic irregularity. Just let us note that the ungrammatical *niniyoja* (AB Śunaḥśepopākhyāna) was not taken as an error but as a Vedic irregularity by Sāyaṇa. I am looking for Ṣaḍguruśiṣya’s comments on the same, but have not yet been able to procure a copy of his commentary on the second half of the AB. My question is: Has any commentator used the term *vaiyatyayika* in such case?

From the submissions so far received it appears that the usage was not current. We have to stick to the idioms used by Sāyaṇa.

But I admit that I hugely benefited from the correspondences. Each scholar made a point whose value has to be admitted.

My sincere thanks to all those who contributed

Best wishes for all

Dipak Bhattacharya
