Dear Colleagues,

I am placing before my esteemed colleagues a usage problem of Sanskrit which might have been faced by those who are engaged in producing commentarial literature in the Sanskrit language. I do not expect any permanent solution but am inquisitive about the views of those who have faced the problem.

While commenting on an irregular form in a Vedic text in English we just say this is an irregular form. A discrepancy in number of the subject and the verb is noted as, say, ’The plural is irregular.’ or ‘A singular form was expected’. Whitney’s translation gives many examples of such notes.

In Sanskrit Sāyaṇa often says ‘व्यत्ययेन बहुवचनम्’, ‘विकरणव्यत्ययः’. I too have always used the word व्यत्ययः। But, I wonder what the language should be when one might want to make a direct translation of say, ‘The language is irregular’ or ‘The plural is irregular’. Till now I say, वहुवचनम् व्यत्ययेन or छान्दसम्, or प्रयोगश्छान्दसः, छान्दसो व्यत्ययः etc.

I think in such cases one may make a direct translation of the word ‘irregular’ with a derivative of व्यत्ययः। It should be वैयत्ययिकः by न य्वाभ्यां पदान्ताभ्याम् etc. I never used it as I do not know of its employment though वैयासिक is a common form. I shall be grateful if any colleague could confirm having come across the form वैयत्ययिकः। Also I shall be grateful to anyone having thought of a better solution.

Best
