I don't think in both cases they are not related with the word in question derived from व्यत्यय - which itself a भावघञन्त.

  

वियातस्य भावो वैयात्यम् प्रागल्भ्यम्, अविनीतता।as explained in the commentary on the सूत्र - धृषिशसी वैयात्ये॥ ७।२।१९॥ ब्राहृणादित्वात् ५।१।१२३ ष्यञ्।

  

व्यायतिः gives a different meaning विशिष्टा आयतिर्यस्याः सा, व्यायतिः, तया - व्यायत्या is तृतीयान्त of this adjective. नियत्या व्यायत्या and this is also not related in any way to व्यत्यय.

  

Now coming to the consideration of the question raised, it needs a comparison of the concepts and etymology according to both the languages English and Sanskrit.

  

In English, the concept presents a negative concept absence of regularity, ir-regularity, from a positive adjective regular. In Sanskrit, it it is an abstract noun suggesting positive fact, which conveys the crosswise shift of the operation by the rules prescribed. So both are independent concepts and each are justified in their context natural to the respective languages. That is why Mr. Namboothiri just remarked व्यत्यय is the proper word, which is specifically technically explanation of the technical term बहुल designated as "व्यत्ययो बहुलम्" and the commentator uses this word व्यत्ययेन to mean due to the operation of the function व्यत्यय = बहुल, and now it is not used in the negative concept of irregularity. Even though व्यत्यय can give etymologically secondary derivatives व्यात्यिक or व्यात्ययिक (including it among कर्मव्यतिहार the meaning I have already explained) due to the operation of the prohibition to the first negation and aic, in this case as per न कर्मव्यतिहारे॥ ७।३।६\|\| it may not convey the same meaning as adjective irregular, but roughly convey that is related to व्यत्यय which can be ill suited in the discussion of the operation of the grammar rules. In English it is used to describe a deviation of the regular or normal language, and purely an adjective highlighting deviation of any element of the language, not specific to any grammatical operation as it is used in Sanskrit Grammar.

  

This is just my idea of the issue as per the question by Prof. Bhattacharya for using it parallel to the English adjective "irregular form/language". In commentary they denote the irregularity of the operation of the rule prescribed for the function only and not to the form. In respect of the forms, they have शिष्टः प्रयोगः, अशिष्टः प्रामादिकः प्रयोगः commonly used in the context of discussion on grammatical compatibility of the usage.

  

Modern Linguistics do not find any Error in the use of language, but only differing from dialect, register etc. even personal usages are accepted. So छान्दस would be only archaic usage, which is conveyed by व्यत्यय. Otherwise प्रमाद एवायम्, प्रामादिक एव would be found profusely.



If by any chance, such usages found welcome as a new source of knowledge by which one can directly translate irregular form or irregular usage from English.

  

Thanks for raising the issue.
