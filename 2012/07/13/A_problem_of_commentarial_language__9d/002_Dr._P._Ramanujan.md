Dear Prof Dipak Bhattacharya!  
  
Sri Vedanta Desika \[13-14th Cent.\] has used नियत्या  
'वैयात्यं' in his magnum opus,  
श्रीमद्रहस्यत्रयसारः ।

\>In Sanskrit Sāyaṇa often says ‘व्यत्ययेन बहुवचनम्’, ‘विकरणव्यत्ययः’. I too have always used the word व्यत्ययः।But, I wonder what the language should be when one might want to make a direct translation of say, ‘The language is irregular’ or ‘The plural is irregular’. Till now I say,वहुवचनम् व्यत्ययेन or छान्दसम्, or प्रयोगश्छान्दसः, छान्दसो व्यत्ययः etc.  
\>I think in such cases one may make a direct translation of the word ‘irregular’ with a derivative of व्यत्ययः। It should be वैयत्ययिकःby न य्वाभ्यां पदान्ताभ्याम्etc.I never used it as I do not know of its employment though वैयासिक is a common form. I shall be grateful if any colleague could confirm having come across the formवैयत्ययिकः।Also I shall be grateful to anyone having thought of a better solution.
