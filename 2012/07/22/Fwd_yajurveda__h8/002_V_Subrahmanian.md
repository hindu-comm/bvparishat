sri v. sunramanian ji,

long before an ayurved expert told me that Darbha (kusha) have power to seperate the 7 layers of skin, unfortunately i had forgotten all references.

i have observed that camel or goat also never eat this herbal grass known as DARBHA or KUSHA.

botanical experts requested to throw more light on this,

warm regeards,

kamalesh pathak
