Dear Kamlash ji,

The very first chapter of Yajurved is an ISO 9000 type of Vedic system to monitor, train and manage Organic Cow based Agriculture life. This was the system implementedby Darshporurnmaseshti yagnas. 

If we try to understand the fine points of these Ved mantras our country and society will be greatly benefited by blessings of Vedic knowledge.

As an example just see what the second mantra of Yajyved says.



" वसो: पवित्रमसि द्यौरसि पृथिव्यसि मातरिश्वनो घर्मोsसि विश्वधाsसि ।

परमेण धाम्ना दृँहस्व मा ह्वार्मा ते यज्ञपतिर्ह्वाषीत्‌ ॥ यजु 1.1.2

Manage the elements in and around goshala as follows ;( Equally applicable to all habitats) to be blessed with all material welfare:

1. पवित्रमसि *–**pawitrmasi; *Grow कुशा –दूब (Botanic name-Cynodon Dactylon) on all the open space. It is heldin Vedic tradition that grass called *kusha/doob* is a natural purifier. This grass is used in all ritualistic ceremonies and worships to purify water. Rural milk vendors in Eastern UP often put a top layer of this grass to act as a sieve while milking their cows in to the milking pan. There was a tradition to use ashes-Bhasm with Kusha to clean all used vessels.

*Darsheshti yajna* that monitors the current state ( now visible in darsh) of entire agriculture pastoral activities.

Yajurved mantra1.1.3 is used in monitoring the milk production of cows when the milk man in Darsheshti yagna is asked- “पुनातु वसो: पवित्रेण शतधारेण सुप्वा कामधुक्ष:” “*punaatu wasoh shatadhaaren supwaa kaamadhukshah”* After straining through a sieve of Cynodon Dactylon for sanitising the milk , which cow has provided this milk?

(There is still a tradition in Eastern UP villages for putting a layer of washed Kusha in the vessel in which cow is being milked. Thus all cow milk comes after coming in contact with Kusha. This grass Kusha is also put in drums in whichmilk is being transported. It is believed that contact of milk with this grass enhances the shelf life of milk. (This can be a topic of research toreduce dependence onpasteurisation to the extent where milk is not transported over long distances. Even hermetically sealing of good clean milk can enhance shelf life of milk by reducing growth of bacteria. ) There is a Vedic Tradition that Kusha PURIFIES. Kusha is put in water used in all Vedic rituals. Our rishis were great scientists. There is a perfect scientific basis behind all
procedures that are laid down in our rituals. Some ritual practises may have got distorted due to our ignorance and not understanding our scriptures.

It is now confirmed by modern science that *kusha* or *doob* with botanical name Cynodon Dactylon has fungicidal, bacticidal properties.
It is also well known that this grass grows only in good organically rich soil. Thus all soil should be well fertilised with cowdung and cow urine to ensure growing of this grass.

1.1 Logically pastures should also be rich with this variety of grass. If a cow feeds on larger proportion of this grass, can the milk of such a cow be expected to have better shelf life?

World famous Soil scientist Prof William Albrecht of Missouri University in early last century had established that cow has inborn natural soil monitoring sense. Cow tends to deposit cow dung and Urine in soil spots that are in need of soil improvement. Cow remedies waste land by grazing on it. It is an important lesson for modern soil scientists engaged in reclamation of Waste lands. ( In fact there is pointed reference to this topic in Vedas)

Our Sanskrit scholars must learn modern sciences and or collaborate with scientists to unearth the hidden and forgotten meaning in Vedas for welfare of humanity .

With warm wishes,

Subodh Kumar
