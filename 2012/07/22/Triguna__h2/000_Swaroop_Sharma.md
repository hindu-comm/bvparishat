Esteemed scholars,

-   **I have taken up a research in Triguna**.

-   I am searching for the word **Triguna** in all the major Indian
    scriptures.

&nbsp;

-   After some initial research I found this word in Mahabharata,
    Ayurveda and of course Sankhya and Bhagavadgita.

&nbsp;

-   Are there any famous Kavyas or any other famous Indian scriptures,
    like Vrikshayurveda, Artha-shastra Etc., in which we can find this
    word 'Triguna'?

&nbsp;

-   I have started to study Moola Ramayana and as of now haven't found
    the word 'Triguna'

&nbsp;

-   In Vedic literature too this word as told by many is not to be
    found.

&nbsp;

-   Is it true that this word Triguna is a Mahabharata time or a post
    Mahabharata time word.

&nbsp;

-   Is there any work available which is exclusively on Trigunas?

  

-   **Can you all please enlighten me about the aforesaid questions?**

  

  

**Dhanyavad**
