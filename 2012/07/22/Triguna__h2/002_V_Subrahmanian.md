shvetashvataropanishat 5th Chapter 7th mantra contains the word: 'triguNaH'  
  
गुणान्वयो यः फलकर्मकर्ता कृतस्य तस्यैव स चोपभोक्ता । *स विश्वरूपस्त्रिगुणस्त्रिवर्त्मा* प्राणाधिपः सञ्चरति स्वकर्मभिः ॥७॥

There are several references to the term 'guNa' in the above Upanishad.
If one carefully searches and reads the Bhashya attributed to Shankaracharya, one may identify terms in the Upanishad which mean triguNa.  
  
The above Upanishad has been quoted several times in the Bhashyas of Shankaracharya.  
  
The SrimadbhAgavatam too can be looked into.
