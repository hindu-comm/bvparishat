Respected scholars,

While studying Shukla Yajurved chapter 17 the very first mantra, addressed toMarut devta " अश्मन्नूर्जं पर्वते शिश्रियाणामद्‌भ्यsओषधीभ्यो वनस्पतिभ्योsअधि सम्भ्रतं पय: । तां
नsइषमूर्जं धत्त मरुत: सँरराणाअश्मँस्ते तsऊर्ग्‌ द्विष्मस्तं ते शुगृच्छतु ॥ यजु17.1." suggested the formation of alluvial rich soil by disintegration of rocks on the mountains for being brought down to provide fertigation of herbs and agriculture. According to modern science the disintegration of rocks in formation of fresh alluvial soil is caused by microbes in the rocks. Could Maruts also correspond to the world of microbiology.

Out of this curiosity i have tried to follow most of the mantras of Yajurved chapter 17.

My assessment is being sent attached with this mail. I shall be very grateful if scolars will find it worth their while to enlighten me on this topic.

With best regards to all,--
