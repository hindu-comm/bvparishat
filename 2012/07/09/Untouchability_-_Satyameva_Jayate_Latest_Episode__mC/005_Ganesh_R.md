Dear Sri. Srikanth Jamadagni,  
  
Thanks for your inputs and me too have felt many times that all our yati-s, peeThaadhipati-s and traditional scholars shouldl come forward and declare as you said. technically too there is nothing wrong it as we know the famous dictum : kaalE kaalE navaacaarO navaa vaaNee mukhE mukhE and all this is noting but a vishEShadharma, just rooted in rUpa and not at all in svarUpa. I feel that BVP would lead in this direction so that the guns of forums/programs/people of the sort of satyamEva jayatE are well challenged.  
  
  
regards  
  
ganesh
