Dear Mr. Srivatsa,  
  
Enough of your enthusiasm of picking a bone with me:-). I My stand is made even more clearer by Sri. Srikanth Jamadagni. My only contention is difference is the very nature of this world and one has to transcend
it. In this process, the rUpa has to be changed and the svarUpa remains unchanged. varna or jaati are only too peripheral to sanaatanadharma and our own life styles is an example of this. If you are not for this, it naturally shows that you are not in tune with the anubhava and hence I only have to say svasti tubhyaM vitaNDinE!
