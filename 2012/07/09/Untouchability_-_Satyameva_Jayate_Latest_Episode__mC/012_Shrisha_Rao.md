I am not familiar with this verse, but the \*concept\* that the masses  
follow the lead of the distinguished is quite standard, cf.  
प्रधानानुयायिनो जनव्यवहारा भवन्ति (cited by Madhusudana Saraswati  
under Bhagavad Gita III-21, यद्यदाचरति श्रेष्ठस्तत्तदेवेतरो जनः). The  
claim मम वर्त्मानुवर्तन्ते मनुष्याः पार्थ सर्वशः (BG III-23) is taken  
quite literally by all traditional commentators.
