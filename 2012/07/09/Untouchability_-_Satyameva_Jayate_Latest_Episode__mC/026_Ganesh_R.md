Dear Mr. Ganesan,  
  
It is no wonder that the Jains practiced varNaashrama-s. It too clear in their religious texts. but the Buddhists do not follow the system of varNa. But even in them we see aashrama-s. The crux of the issue is do we have an exit option in the varNa and ashramma systems as prescribed in the dharmashaastra-s by and large? As for my study in the dhasrmashaastric literature, the exit option is an exceptionally rare thing. But it used to be seen t least in the earlier works. This used to be even more so in actual practice. But not at all found in the later works. Much of our orthodoxy, even to this day, is unfortunately based on these utopian texts of watertight compartments and conveniently avoids at times facing the hard realities of artha and kaama. While facing the intellectual challenges, debates using pseudo-logic which are obviously full of logical fallacies as it lacks anubhava-niShThaa. But the modern world, supposed to have based on freedom, equality/equal opportunities and reasoning gives an exit option. People who are enjoying/suffering these should seriously and honestly too focus their minds on this aspect which is the crux of the problem, if any:-)  
  
regards
