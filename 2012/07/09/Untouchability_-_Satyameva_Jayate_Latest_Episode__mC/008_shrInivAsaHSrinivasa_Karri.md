Dear Scholors,  
 SJ episode may be just one of the many instances. We face this question repeatedly from various people espacially from conversion-hungry missioneries, muslims, sometimes from socalled lower caste hindus who are under the same impression. The fact is there is a widespread perception that Caste System(with that Untouchabilty) is invitable in Hinduism. And Missioneries are using it to their advantage. I request all the scholors here to guide us to answer such critics. it may include taking our message agressively to the masses or setting our house in order.  
Please guide us  
  
धन्यवादः  
श्रीनिवासः
