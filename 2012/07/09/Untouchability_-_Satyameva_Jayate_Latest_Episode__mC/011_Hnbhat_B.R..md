Just like the above statement. Such an issue can be invitable by those
who want it to criticize it, while it is inevitable that it is maintained there in the scriptures themselves. Each can make it yield to his advantage.

  

So far they are society is followed complimentary to each other sections, caste system may prove to be advantageous. On the other hand, it can be used to take advantage by some sections or leaders of the community, depending on the leadership adversely.

  

Is it necessary to indulge in such complicated social issues in this forum meant for discussion of anything related with vidvat on different branches of knowledge and share and increase our knowledge?

  

Members may react accordingly.

  

This is a humble suggestion.
