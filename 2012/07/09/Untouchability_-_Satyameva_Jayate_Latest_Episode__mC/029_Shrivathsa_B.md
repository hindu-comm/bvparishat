hariH OM,  
gaNesh Sir,

  
  
"My only contention is difference is the very nature of this world and one has to transcend it."  

 Is this the sAmAnya dharma you are expecting out of the world? What if one doesn't want to transcend it? The vast majority in the world for whom adhyAtma, anubhava etc. mean precious little. What do you prescribe for those? shAstra has to address everyone in the society, not some selected few.

  
  
" In this process, the rUpa has to be changed and the svarUpa remains unchanged. varna or jaati are only too peripheral to sanaatanadharma and our own life styles is an example of this."  

 This is just like saying "Ayurveda prescribes a healthy lifestyle, and as the majority of people are not in tune with the lifestyle prescribed by Ayurveda, let us change the texts of Ayurveda"! I don't know what you mean by saying varNa is peripheral to sanAtana dharma. It is the very nature of sanAtana dharma.

  
  
"If you are not for this, it naturally shows that you are not in tune with the anubhava and hence I only have to say svasti tubhyaM vitaNDinE!"  

 Above has been answered before. The question is not about anubhava. The question is about what one deduces out of one's anubhava. According to you, the shAstra needs emendation. According to us, it doesn't.  
  
svasti,  
 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,  

shrivathsa.
