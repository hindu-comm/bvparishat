dear all,

I dont think we need answer this fool's (amir's) show. he is making it for only money. himself married twice and who knows what happens in future. it is bible in devil's mouth. he should do a show onbigamyalso.

  

but who was the lady sanskrit professor and we should ask her to substantiate her claims or should reclaim her statements.

  

these showmakers always have a trick that works well. they will invite a poorest person to debate and win it. it is the same for Dr. Zakir Naik who is the leader of anti hindu TV shows. he even defeats shri ravishankar in a live debate. recently Prof. Hafiz Mohammed Ziauddin Alias Shamsi Tehraniwho was given presidents award for Farsi this year, told me that Zakir Naik knows nothing. we should use scholars scholars likeTehranito counter fools like Zakir Naik.

ततः स्वधर्मं कीर्तिं च हित्वा पापमवाप्स्यसि।।

तस्मादुत्तिष्ठ कौन्तेय युद्धाय कृतनिश्चयः।
