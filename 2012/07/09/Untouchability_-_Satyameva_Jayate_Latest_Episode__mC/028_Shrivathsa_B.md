hariH OM,  
shrii Shrikant,  
  
 What does the varNa vyavasthA mean practically? The varNavyavasthA is based on the framework of duties. What is one's duty will not be another's. This presents a different world view altogether. Moreover, one doing the duties assigned to one's varNa will be doing his svadharma. performance of svadharma is "good" ultimately.  
  
 Don't mix up frameworks. cAturvarNya doesn't talk about sweepers. It talks about four varNas. If you are specific about the varNa of the sweeper, we may progress further in our discussion.
