Thank you Mr.Shirsha Rao...well said by you.... The beauty and nobility of our shastra-s is in transcending them and this is not all thought of by the Semitic religions. All the objections laid down by the people like SJ and co are only restricted to the viSEShadhrama-s and these differ from time to time and place to place. As Sri Shankara has clearly said, these are all puruSha/kartRtantra-s and not the timeless vstutantra-s or saamaanya-dharma-s. All such quires are well answered by people like Swami Vivekananda, Swmi chinmayaananda, mahaamahOpaadhyaaya P.V.Kane, M. Hiriyanna and many more.
