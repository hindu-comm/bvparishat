Abhivadaye,



Thaks for all the inputs, I will try how I can take this forward for a response. Satyameva Jayates is a very popular TV show in India and has already done enuf damage. But I point is what i wanted to know was where is it stated that "shudras are supposed to wear clothes that smell" as claimed by the professor.
