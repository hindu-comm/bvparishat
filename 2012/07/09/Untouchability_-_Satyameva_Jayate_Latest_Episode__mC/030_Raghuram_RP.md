Abhivadaye,



Just to bring back the focus to the intital topic raised, the name of the Samskrita lady professor who made the claims is "Dr Kaushal Pawar", teaches Samskrita in Delhi University. I wanted some pointers on how to answer the questions raised. Do dharmashastras proclaim that shudras have to wear smell clothes and other claims made in the show? If yes how do we interpret it and send a reply. I atleast want to put a comment on the SMJ website giving some clarifications. I would request the help of esteemed scholars in the foru,



Raghuram
