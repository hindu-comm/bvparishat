If one is to find fault with Sanskrit texts in that manner, then by  
the same token, we should grant that the Koran's explicit messages to  
Muslims to kill infidels is ultimately responsible for much of the  
violence and terrorism in the world today, and for the rather pathetic  
state of Islamic society in general (it having regressed from being a  
repository of learning and culture in earlier centuries, before  
Islamic fanaticism could take hold). Thus, much worse can be said of  
the Koran (cf. <http://www.answering-islam.org/NonMuslims/die_kill.htm>)  
in the same way. Would Aamir Khan risk a fatwa on his head to say  
such things then also?
