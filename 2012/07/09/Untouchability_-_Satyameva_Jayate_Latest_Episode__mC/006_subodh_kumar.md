Dear Shrikant ji,

You have made a very pertinent statement.

It has so far not been possible to get our traditional Dharmacharys like Jagadguu Shankaracharyas to endorse these much needed clarifications on gender equality and caste based differentiations. Persons of the stature of Aurobindo, Vivekand, Swami Dayanand, Guru Nanak, Kabir have been making such desired efforts over centuries, but even their efforts often seem ineffective.

How and what strategy should evolve goes back to the basics of poverty alleviation through Education/ Skill development, decentralised economies such as a house hold cow providing unadulterated nutrition to the family and society by organic food at least in rural sector.

In India every thing tends to degenerate in to self oriented power centres. Our successive Govts and planning commission have very noble intentions but every thing is lost in its mode of implementation. Panchayat Raj was conceived only on this wisdom of 'small is beautiful', but see what has it come to.

I wonder if scholars of BVP can suggest some positive strategies.
