Dear Dr. Subodh Kumar ji and other scholar-friends,  
  
I am happy that good lot of pertinent response is being generated and I especially than Sri Subrhamaniyan's observations. We need not be unduly apologetic.Great people like Gandhi ji. D. V. Gundappa, Ananda Kumara Swamy and many more of our times too have spoken about the positive aspects of varNa system and its due acceptance in the early times. In-spite of this, unless we declare that varNa is an intrinsic quality of every person based on the triguNa-s and not on birth alone and it has a greater meaning if taken as one's in choice, as happened in the earliest vedic period and also in these days, we cannot strike the cord of harmony and honesty. Here I can just request the scholars to go to works like BRhadaaraNyaka up.,(I-4-14), Mhaabhaarata vanaparvan ; ajagaropaakhyaana and the modern works like mahaasaamraajyanibandhanam, a sutra work of KaavyakaNTha vaasshThaganapatimuni, caaturvarNya-bhaaratasameekShaa by mahaamaNdalEshwara mahEshvaraanandagiri, varNavyavasthaa kaa vaidikarUp by laalaa jnaanacand aarya and My VarNaashramadharma by M.K. Gandhi (editor A.N.Hingorani)  
for better insights and information in this regard. I also like to bring to attention a recent Sanskrit work kauNDinyasmRti of MahaamahOpaadhyaaya P. Ramacahndrudu which has an English translation also penned by the same author. I would humbly wish to suggest my own work, Saamaanyadharma in Kannda too here as a writing of similar concern.  
  
regards
