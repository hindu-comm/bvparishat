I'll like to know the meaning of neglection.

So, marrying to lower caste is acceptance !!??

You can't make rules to force one to marry to lower caste. Let people choose. Don't try to take away freedom of individuals and hindu groups.

If you do, then leave it. Why are you doing this ?

I will like to hear.

  

I just want to say that differentiation of people according to caste or birth has it's root in veda-s and so it is anAdi. Those who have faith in veda-s follow it. If you don't have, don't follow. Declare it and be free. I think same was said by dharmAdhikArI in the show.  
  

But, I'm of view that just this differentiation doesn't cause any harm. This differentiation doesn't say that you must abuse shUdra-s.

What brAhmaNa-s or others did going out of range of veda-s and smR^iti-s doesn't make scriptures culprit. That act was due to their ego, etc. So, don't blame division, i.e. chAturvarNyam.

  

For now, very few people know about or follow veda-s and other scriptures. Even then not all are equal. Are they ? Someone is sweeping road, some one is engaged in business, someone is at border to protect and someone is busy in teaching. These differences don't go. And your discriminative behavior too stays with it. I've seen many families that say that they treat all equally, their son and son of sweeper. But, I've not seen it confirmed by their behavior. So, before trying to eliminate the partition, which is not the actual cause of abuse, try to educate yourself to respect others. Killing mosquito for death caused by serpent is not wise.  

  

Again, before abusing differentiation based on scriptures, you must check that what will happen when this will disappear ? And is it really causing abuses ?  

  

Even countries where their is no caste, they find a way to differentiate each other on the basis of skin, etc. which is again based on birth and then they fight.  
  
Again, differences are fact. For example, those who convert to Islam are not considered equal to others. Why ? Because, the differentiating factor, i.e. conversion, is a fact. It's not an imagination. So, if you have to stay within a system, either hindu or others, you must accept the difference. As soon as you shun the wish and signs of the system, you are free of that partition. So, people must leave religion rather than expecting partition to evaporate.  
So, basically the problem is in accepting religion and not accepting.  
  
Moreover, if you leave religion, are you going to force government to make a law to eradicate religion ? That will be unfair. If you don't want to follow partition and religion, do according to your wish. But, leave those who have faith in it. This is the freedom which is given by constitution.  
  
People bring ekalavya, etc. to show abuse. That's also wrong. Compare it to today's situation. What if I go to a nuclear-lab and steal the formula. People will shoot me at the sight.  
Same was the case of ekalavya. He was doing the same with dhanur-vidyA.  
If you don't see any comparison between both ? Then it's your problem. dhanurvidyA is equally dangerous, in my thinking , if it goes to wrong hands.  
  
In no way we support abuse. But, first of all let us establish that which act is an abuse and what is it's real cause.  

  
More later..........
