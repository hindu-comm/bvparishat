Dont you think that sudras were neglected in our society when Brahmanas ruled. Even today upper cast people cant accept lower cast for their son or daughter's marriage. We so called literate people do injustice to not only backward class but also lower casts. I can give you many sources or examples from our Purana literature.

The hardness in our heart is ego. The softness in our heart is love.  
Love all, Mother Teresa said:-  
"If you judge people,  
you have no time to love them."
