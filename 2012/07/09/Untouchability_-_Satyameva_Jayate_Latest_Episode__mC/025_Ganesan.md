From my experience in cataloguing different types of manuscripts belonging to Tamil speaking Jaina-s in Tamilnadu which I catalogued a few years back, I found to my surprise texts that treat the ritual of CAATURVARNYA SANDHYAAVANDANAVIDHI composed in very good Sanskrit and written neatly in Grantha script of the Jaina-s (I should say to the credit of the present day Jaina-s, that they take real pains to preserve those fragile old palm-leaf manuscripts).  
  
All of us know that both Buddhism and Jainism since their beginning were avowedly against the Vedic VarNaashrama system. But curiously these unpublished texts found in the palm-leaf bundle describe in detail the rite of sandhyaavandana to be practised by Jain-s born in four varNa-s !!!!  
  
And, lo wait! what is more, I was told that the priests that conduct worship in the ancient Jaina temples situated in some parts of Tamilnadu are called 'VaattiyAr' just as BrahmaNa purohita-s are called in Tamil; and, further, only the son of a jaina 'Vaattiyaar' is qualified to do worship in the Jaina temple and not any lay Jaina. I found that in many villages they strictly follow that rule.  
  
***So CaaturvarNyam is by birth and cannot be otherwise.***  
  
This is attested to even by the practice of followers of Avaidika religious systems such as the Jaina=-s WHO AT THE EBGINNING (2500 YEARS BACK) SWORE BY EQUALITY OF ALL AND TRIED EVERY OTHER METHOD TO DEMOLISH THE VEDIC VARNASHRAMA SYSTEM AT LEAST IN THEIR TEXTS.
