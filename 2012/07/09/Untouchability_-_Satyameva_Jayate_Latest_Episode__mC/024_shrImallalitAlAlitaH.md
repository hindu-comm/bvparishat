If it's nature of world, of which you are a part, then you can't transcend difference.  
Nature is that which is not changed.

And, svarUpa = nature. So, difference never goes is what you mean !! ??  
  

> varna or jaati are only too peripheral to sanaatanadharma

  
I don't know about which sanAtana-dharma you are talking. Atleast, sanAtana-dharma based on veda-s is not of such nature. varNa is it's very important part as yAga, etc. are for specific adhikArin-s with specific varNa-s.  
A little more study will reveal to you that chAturvarNya is the sign of vaidika-dharma.  
  

> and our own life styles is an example of this.

  
Those who transgress vaidika-vidhi-s, etc. are in no way example for vaidika-s.  
Remember tattirIyakopaniShat -yAnyasmAkam sucharitAni,............

Bowing down to kAma, etc. is not puruShArtha. So, these people are not one with you.  
Moreover, remember that chAturvarNya, etc. is not extinct yet(instead of your prophecy).

Same tactics as used by SMJ, etc.  
Anyway, vitaNDA need very special quality. So, we are proud of having this ability. Now, save your views.
