Hariom,

I advise the august members of this group to read "Being Different', "Breaking India", by Rajiv Malhotra. This issue has been dealt very nicely by him.

Such issues are raised to make Hindus feel guilty and lose faith in their own scriptures and religion. Then they are soft targets for conversion to Christianity or Islam.

There arediscriminationin every society. In USA, which is propagated as the land of freedom, there are seperate churches for blacks and whites. Communism failed because it was against difference among various class of people.

Difference is unavoidable. that is sanaatana dharma. But there should be no exploitaion. In our own body head is different from handas,belly, and feet. But they work in cooperation. If my foot is heart my head will direct my hand to help it.

The real problem is lack of spiritual education and lack of good character. as long as avidya exists the strong will exploit the weak.

There is a joke, in capitalism man exploits man, in communism it is other way around.

S. N. Dasa
