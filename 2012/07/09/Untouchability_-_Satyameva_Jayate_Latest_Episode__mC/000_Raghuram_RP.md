Abhivadaye Scholars,



In the latest episode of SJ, we saw a lady Samskrita Professor who accuses shastras of encouraging untochability. She claimed that our shastras say that shudras should always wear clothes that smell (bad smell). They should always be dependent on higher castes for food and are not supposed to do anything on their own. I would request the scholars to confirm if our dharmashastras say so. They also claimed that the purusha soktha rik (brahmana came from the mouth, etc.. - was shown that the verse exists in Manusmrithi) was the source of all this problems (untouchability). I wanted to know where such quotes are given and is this the right method to interpret the quotes.
