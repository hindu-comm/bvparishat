hariH OM,  
shri shrikant,  
  
 Please find the responses to your mail below:

  
"I agree with a lot of your responses but our thoughts regarding a new declaration with regards to caatur-varnya is against one and only one
issue as follows :- Does a family of x-caste have to follow the same occupation and be known as belonging to x-caste till eternity? Our answer is "No". I hope you are in agreement with me."  

 First things first: I don't feel a need for any new declaration on varNAshrama. varNAshrama, with all its real and imagined weaknesses has stood the test of time and in my humble analysis, it has prevented our forefathers from becoming muslims or christians. Just see the cultures Islam and Christianity have uprooted and analyze their social structures, you will understand.  
 The answer to the second question is: It is ideal that they do so. It helps.

  
  
"I think there will always be four varnas in all cultures as taught by shruti. The question is whether the caste should be determined by birth or by choice."  

 choice is a flimsy thing.  

1.  There are people these days who claim that they are
    man-locked-up-in-a-woman's-body and vice versa. Once they get their
    sex changed, they may feel the urge to go back to their former
    selves. On a lighter note, there was a woman who had come to the
    Indian Institute of Science when I was studying there 7 yrs ago. on
    being requested by a group called Queer (the group which purportedly
    stood for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender rights). This singer
    claimed that she was gay. One was confused because going by her sex,
    she should have called herself a lesbian. But she gave a
    clarification that she is a man trapped in a woman's body and she
    feels the urge to have sex with men, hence she isn't a lesbian, she
    is gay!!!  
2.  There are people who militate against the principle of stable
    marriage in sanAtana dharma saying that their partners need to be
    determined based on their "current" state of mind. One needn't
    imagine the social incohesion, depravity and wretchedness this will
    cause in the society, one just needs to see the record of
    scandinavian countries. Europe as a whole is following suit and so
    is the US. 3.  An agnihotri while performing a somayAga suddenly feels that he is
    no longer a brahmin, and he has to go to war. Or a warrior in the
    battlefield suddenly feels that he is an agnihotri. Is this what is
    being suggested? 4.  It doesn't take an Einstein to determine that we aren't what we were
    yesterday, so, our varNa will go on changing by the day/hour/minute?
    Why even talk of such a flimsy thing as that or why limit it to 4
    varNas? Don't you see it clearly that you want to concoct something
    that has the shell of sanAtana dharma devoid of its soul? The
    Christians do it much better. They have appropriated diipAvali, in
    Kerala they have appropriated vidyArambha, and we know that they are
    trying very hard to appropriate Yoga. What you are aiming for is a
    cheap imitiation of their efforts.  

So, are we to rest one's varNa on choice?

  
  
" Actually this question is already answered as a matter of everyday-fact by the Hindu community at large."  

 Just because a large number of people are doing something wrong, it doesn't endorse or condone the act.  
 varNa of a person is determined by his past karma. Birth in a certain yoni is dependent on one's accumulated karma. Anyone who denies this may call himself anything but a "hindu".

  
  
svasti,  
 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,
