Your chAturvarNya ? Who are you to decide varNa of others ? A specific avatAra or a prophet like buddha and muhammad ?  
We don't accept anything imagined by you or VHP, RSS, etc. I know that they don't follow scriptures strictly and are in a way dangerous as other 'reformers'. Their hinduism is not same as ours. We follow scriptures and decide everything based on that. Their definitions are pointed to make a gathering of hindu-tagged people and nothing more. We are inclined to collect genuine hindus who are not perturbed by SMJ, etc.  
Moreover, the practice to decide varNa by birth is the original one. It is still in practice. And inspite of 'reforms' by Arya-samAja, brahma-samAja, etc. it is alive.  
Moreover if karma decides varNa then kR^iShNa will become brAhmaNa instead of xatriya.  
And every moment varNa of a man with flickering mind will change in that case.

For your dissappointment, our answer is yes.

Your thinking is just imagination.  
Go and ask people of other countries and they will confirm.  
Moreover, varNa-s are for performing yAga, etc. vaidika-karma-s. Not just for jobs to earn money.

I don't know what type of hindus you are referring to and how it is in your favor ?  
Stick to facts and give pause to imaginations based on things read here and there.  
  
By the way, before imagining an alternative did you ever study scriptures in their original ? Or, you came in world and just saw hA.. I've to save the world and started imagining.
