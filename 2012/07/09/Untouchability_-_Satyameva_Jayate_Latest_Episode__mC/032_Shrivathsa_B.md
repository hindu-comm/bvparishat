hariH OM,  
shri shrikant,  
  
 Whatever is the paramparAgata profession, it is best to follow that (this is a guideline and cannot be imposed).  

1.  If your contention is someone being educated should not perform such
    and such duties, then the discrimination is in your mind. No work is
    great or small. Every work is as important as the other. 2.  If your contention is that sweeping profession is not well paid,
    then it is a matter for policy emendation, not shAstra emendation. 3.  Every profession should have enough money for an honest worker to
    live a comfortable life. This was what was in practice in bhArata
    for a very long time (as far as i know). Moreover, basic necessities
    of life were never monetized (as per kauTilya).  

(side note: Everytime I visit my barber for a haircut and shave, I feel envious of his remuneration :-) For about half an hour of work, he takes Rs. 130. I am sure he earns no less than Rs. 1500 to 2000 per day)

  
  
svasti,  
 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,
