Respected Scholars,  
  
I am also afraid a bit after watching that SJ episode. A poor Kashi Pandit has been interviewed whether he attests the practice of untouchablity. He has not only said yes, but also answered that our constitution is against *shastra*. So, he can't accept constitution as an authority. Of course, it was an individual opinion.  
  
As rightly said by Dr.Ganesh ji, such practices were relative to times/places. In a globalized and knowledge (?) society, such instances may occur in feeble number. It was said that 'कलौ पाराशरस्मृतिः'. Since it is popular Manu is widely followed. Also, I doubt the authenticity of blunt language used by Manu etc. Because, our Sanskrit scholars are very creative. An 'x' creates a work and attributes it to some 'y'. Even the great Mahabharatam is not an exception from interpolations as interpreted by BORI, Pune.  
  
It is the collective duty of mathadhipathis, swamijis to counteract the anti-Hindu statements. But how many of them really come out? Forget about Amir khan, but who dares to accept the risk of a 'fatwa'. All this is due to foreign influence and their strong impression on our psyche. You are considered an 'intellectual' if you speak against Hindutva (not orthodox Hindutva). Rajiv Malhotra is touring all over the world to voice his strong views in this connection.  
  
Sri Shrisharao's response is very worthy but that is not a solution as it may reflect the adage - 'eye for an eye'. I am curious to know is there any other kind of interpretation to 'ब्राह्मणोस्य मुखमासीत्' and so on? An electrical engineer, Sri Satish Chandra in Bangalore had worked for a couple of decades to interpret purusha suktha otherwise and derived a new meaning of electrical engineering! He has built a generator that multiplies the input power four times. The interesting factor is it doesn't use any fuel but absorbs cosmic energy. HH Sri Bharati Tirtha Swamiji has visited his institution.  
  
I for one, look for the *samskara* and personal hygiene of my next person, nothing else.  
  
Regards,  
Prasad
