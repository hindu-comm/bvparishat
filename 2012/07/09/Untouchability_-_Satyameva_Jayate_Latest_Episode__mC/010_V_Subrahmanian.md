Pl. consider this:  
  

Long ago I had heard the following verse which says: From the 'brAhmaNa-s' of 'this' country all the other people from the world over learn/ed the rules of conduct. Here is an excerpt from the Wikipedia:

[http://sa.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%A8%E0%A5%81%E0%A4%B8%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%AE%E0%A5%83%E0%A4%A4%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%83](http://sa.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%A8%E0%A5%81%E0%A4%B8%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%AE%E0%A5%83%E0%A4%A4%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%83)  

पृथिव्याः प्रायो विभिन्नदेशानां विधिप्रणयनप्रसङ्गे भगवतो मनुमहर्षेः नाम उल्लिखितं दृश्यते । भारतात् बहिः प्रायः कतिपयानां देशानां विधिशास्त्रेषु मनुसंहितायाः केचनांशा अपि समुद्धृता दृश्यन्ते । आचारव्यवहारविधिनिषेधादीनां व्यवस्थानां तुलनात्मकधिया मनुस्मृतिरद्वितीयाऽनुपमा चास्ति । मनुस्मृतौ एतस्मात् कारणात् लिखितमस्ति...

**एतद्देशप्रसूतस्य सकाशादग्रजन्मनः ।**

**स्वं स्वं चरित्रं शिक्षेरन् पृथिव्यां सर्वमानवाः ॥**

In every nation, religion, we can find, if we penetrate into it and study, distinctions based on one or the other factors like birth, avocation (vRtti), etc. The terrorist from Pakistan held in India now, 'Kasab' is someone belonging to a low class/caste (in Islam/Pakistan) who are engaged in meat selling, etc. The President of United States would not dine with the persons engaged in lowly jobs of that country.
A 'Nadar' Christian would not intermarry with 'Reddy' or 'scheduled caste' Christian. Ireland faces age long struggle between the Protestant and Catholics. Shias and Sunnis have been at 'war' almost in every country where Muslims are there. Basavanna revolted against the 'caste system' in the Vedic Hindu religion and started a new order of 'Vira shaivas'. But this order has in itself a multi class-caste distinction. There are 'ayyanavaru' class who perform puja, rituals, etc. in Lingayat families. There are panchAchAryas, pancha sAlis, and some other specific class/caste. There will be no intermarriage, etc. among/across these classes.  

The earlier Sringeri Acharya, once made an official announcement that people should not make distinctions in public like while drawing water from a public pond/well. One can practice his vishesha dharma inside his house.
