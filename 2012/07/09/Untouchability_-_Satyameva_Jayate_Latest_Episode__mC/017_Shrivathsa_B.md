hariH OM,  
  
 I bow down in reverence to the response of svAmI lalitAlAlitaH.  
  
 People everywhere seem to have the impression that once the Hindu Shastras fail to be "imposed" (it was never imposed and is not being imposed these days either), this world will become paradise. Let us ask ourselves simple questions:  

1.  There is discrimination of the worst sort everywhere in the form of
    monetary discrimination. A person with a money bag will get a
    medical seat, PG medical seat etc. He can bribe his way out of any
    heinous crime, etc. etc. etc. Instead of fighting this, the target
    is Hindu shAstras which have for long been neglected and who aren't
    being practiced anymore. 2.  The discrimination due to status is another form of discrimination
    being practiced in India right now. An MP or an MLA lives a life
    which is as (if not more) decadent as any king of the past. It is
    this discrimination which needs to be our focus, rather than the
    discrimination against which laws have been enacted. Moreover, the
    "discrimination" earlier was not in the sugar-coated pill of
    "equality" (everyone is equal in law, but some are more equal than
    others!!!).  
3.  There are laws against untouchability and even laws against calling
    people "caste names", still people like Amir Khan want to talk about
    untouchability. Amazing. This is simply brazenness. Anyone who wants
    to talk against Hindu Shastra automatically gets the aura of
    Intellectualism. Is this a failure of law that even with reverse
    discriminative laws they haven't been able to uproot the "evil"? In
    case so, let us talk about implementation of the laws.  
4.  The word "untouchability" is designed to put every hindu on the back
    foot, make him guilty of all real and imagined crimes that his
    forefathers have committed in the past. It is conveniently forgotten
    that the members of "higher" castes used to provide for education of
    "lower" castes, let out their premises for the marriages of "lower"
    caste members etc. 5.  Suddenly, there is an urge to declare that the "varNa" system that
    was prescribed was not based on birth, but on the "guNa"s. So, if
    there be a new "varNa" system as exhorted by Shri Ganesh etc., will
    untouchability be accepted? This goes to show that the varNa
    vyavasthA as was practiced is never the problem (in case this not be
    the deduction, then the exhortation will go in vain). 6.  Why is it that the facts of Shudra Kings like Proleya Vema Reddy
    inscribing that he is taking up arms to protect the "brahmins and
    cows" of Andhra conveniently forgotten? If the shudras were so
    oppressed by brahmins, why would they have taken up arms against
    Islam at all? Same goes for shudra warriors in the north. 7.  Why is it that Amir Khan wants to raise up a bogeyman of
    untouchability against which laws have been enforced than talk of
    evils against which laws haven't been implemented (burqa system,
    genital mutilation of children, etc.). 8.  A great man once hath said, "For the white man, his equality begins
    with food and ends with sleep" (i.e. sleeping with the "equal"
    partner). 9.  How is it that the "oppressed" shudras used to control a large part
    of the economy of India even till the 1750s (Economic History of
    India by R. C. Dutt). 10. The Hindus who take in these arguments find an immediate urge to
    "reform" sanAtana dharma as is being practiced, although it has
    undergone thousands of reformation initiatives. Any more
    "reformation" and there will be nothing to give or take between "us"
    and "them" (people of other religions). 11. If there is abuse in the name of religion, it should be condemned in
    the strongest possible terms and where necessary, legal action
    should be taken. But let us stop this distorted discourse of making
    shAstra or sanAtana dharma the culprit for every ill of the society.
    Stop flogging a dead horse.  

svasti,  
 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,
