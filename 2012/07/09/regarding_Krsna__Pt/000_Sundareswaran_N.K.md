Dear Bhatta Mahodaya,

I am not a scholar. Even then I would like to pen my humble suggestion.

Here the word कृषिः might be used in the sense of the root कृष as in the case of कर्णःकृन्तते:. And the sentence'krsir bhu-vacakah sadbah' simply means the root krs means existence (bhu= सत्ता ). The attractiveness of existence is added meaning.
