Dear Scholars,

        

          Our society is working for preserving and distributing the knowledge of Indology to world on the globe. For this aspect of view our society wants maximum number of qualified scholars of indology to join us. Our society deals with many manuscripts which are under very pathetic condition and helps in best way as much as possible for preserving it as the heritage of our country and the enormous source of knowledge. Our society converts the language into roman so that it can be deal with any people in this world.

              We are working for the INDOLOGY and try to give the knowledge to the world.

                     I include some attachment about our society pleasereferto it.
