\> To: "hnbhat B.R." \<[hnbh...@gmail.com]()\>

\> <http://www.gaurangadharmaglobalmission.org/Maha-mantraYoga/MMChapter3.html>  
\> The Mahabharata (Udyoga-parva) 71.4 states:  
\> krsir bhu-vacakah sadbo, nas ca nirvrti-vacakah  
\> tayor aikyam param brahma, krsna ity abhidhiyate  
\> "The word 'krs' is the attractive feature of the Lord's existence, and 'na'  
\> means  
\> spiritual pleasure. When the verb 'krs' is added to the affix 'na', it  
\> becomes 'Krishna',  
\> which indicates the Supreme Absolute Truth."  

\> 1.i dont understand the explanation here : as i take it "\*krsir bhu-vacakah  

\> sadbo" literally means the word kRSi signify the sense of bhU (earth). is  
\> it corect? How than out of this statement "the word kRSi signify the sense  

\> of bhU (earth)" the statement "\*The word 'krs' is the attractive feature  

\> of the Lord's existence" follows?  

\> \*2. why does this shloka \*(Udyoga-parva) 71.4 explain the meaning of the  

\> noun kRSi and not the meaning of the verb kRS which is in the name kRSNa  
\> 3.Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada in his lecture  
\> <http://www.prabhupadavani.org/main/Bhagavad-gita/GT249.html>  
\> says "Krsi. Krsi means cultivation, and krsi means very great. Krs-dhatu.  
\> So krsna or krs means who repeated repetition of birth, repetition. So krsi  
\> -- "repetition of birth;" na means "one who checks it." He is Krsna.  
\> "Repetition of birth, one who checks," He is Krsna. Therefore our  
\> repetition of birth can be checked only by God. Otherwise not possible.  
\> Harim vina na mrtim taranti: "Nobody can stop his repetition of birth and  
\> death without having the causeless mercy of God.""  
\> The Monier-Williams dictionary doesnt say kRSi means very great , does kRSi  
\> really mean that?  
\> 3.1 The MW also doesnt say kRSi is repetition of birth , does kRSi really  
\> mean that?
