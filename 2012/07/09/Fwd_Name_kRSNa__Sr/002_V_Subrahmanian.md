Nice explanations. Such 'taattvika' explanations are given in order to make it known that such names as Rama, Krishna, VishNu are not confined to a 'person' with a certain description like shankha, chakra, veNu, peacock feathers, etc. That all such names are illustrative, indicative, of Brahman, the Impersonal, is the idea behind such meanings. For example 'Rama' means:  
  
तथा चागस्त्यसंहितायामुक्तम्-  
"रमन्ते योगिनोऽनन्ते सत्यानन्दे चिदात्मनि ।  
इति रामपदेनासौ परं ब्रह्माभिधीयते ।।"
