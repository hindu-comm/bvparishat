The above extract is from the web page gives some more information,, which I am not aware of. I know as well as other scholars of Sanskrit, he has commented in Sanskrit all the five Mahakavya-s to facilitate their teaching and learning. But I do not know he has written translations from Sanskrit to Telugu through his Vyakhyana-s.

  

Some may through more light in this respect, if any one knows about the translations and their publication details.

  

Anyhow thanks for the photo memorial house as his birth place. .
