Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



Please help me. Apte Dictionary offers these meanings.



Niketanah (ending in Visarga) =Onion

Niketanam = House

In these two words all phonemes are the same except the last one. Why meanings are so different? Is gender involved?



Similar situation is observed.



Ks'itijah (ending in Visarga)= tree

Ks'itijam=horizon

I know Ks'iti means earth. So posibilty of YogArudha meaning. It is ok, But why difference?

Or do AnuswAra and Visarga have meanings that causing this differences in meanings?Sometimes the meaning of Ah (Visraga) is given as Vis'Nu. What is the reason?



Thanks. N.R.Joshi
