Why suddenly the Western Indologists are considered to be authentic in  
this case ?  
While we have our own traditional ancient Bhashyakara-s and the  
well-known Amarakosa for the word 'kaparda' and 'kapardii' as well as on  
the strength of one of the names of Siva as "Kapardii" in the  
Sivashtottararsatanaamastotra that forms part of the SkandapurANa, the  
above mentioned explanation is but correct and apt.  
Also the Mahishaasuramardinii Durgaa is spoken as the inseparable Sakti  
of Siva in most of the scriptures.  
  
  
Ganesan
