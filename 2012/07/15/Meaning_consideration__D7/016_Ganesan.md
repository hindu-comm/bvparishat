Dear Mr. Narayana Iyengar,  
  
There is nothing sectarian in my post; as I had written in one of my  
earlier posts sometime back, as soon as something specifically  
pertaining to Siva is pointed out in the Veda-s and the Upanishad-s, at  
once some Vedantins and Sanskrit scholars point that it is sectarian or  
that it has nothing to do with Vedanta.  
  
You say that  

"But to say that Amarakosha and Skaandapuraana are to be accepted  
without bothering about how the more ancient Vedas have used the same  
word, lacks historical perspective."  
  

But the Sri Rudram which is part of the Taittiriiya Samhitaa, clearly  
states  
नमः कपर्दिने च व्युप्तकेशाय च ......  
My point is referring to the Amarakosa is that Amarasimha has included  
'Kapardii' in the lists of Siva's names on the strong support the  
Veda-s such as the Taittiriiyasaamhitaa.  
  
If still one would overlook the supreme authority of the Veda, then one  
can write as one wishes and I should not be found fault with.  
  
I do agree that kaparda or kapardii may mean in a general way anybody  
with long matted locks; but I suppose you know well that while  
interpreting our scriptures one should take note of the 'context' and  
the 'convention'. Also the historicity of the views and conventions  
should be kept in mind.  

  
"For a lay person if the words are taken out of context ‘tryaks.a’ and ‘pinaaka’ may be  
referring to Shiva only."  
  

I do not know what is the source of the Narasimha dhyaanashloka cited by you; also on what authority it describes Narasimha in that way and what the 'historicity' of the text of the Dhyaanashloka is.  
  
But, again, citing the most supreme authority of the Veda, the same Sri Rudram of the TaittiriiyasaMhihtaa says  
"पिनाकं बिभ्रदागहि"  
We also have the mantra which is well known to many:  
"यो ब्रह्मा ब्रह्मण उज्जभार प्राणैः शिरः कृत्तिवासाः पिनाकी ...." which is recited as part of the Ayushyahoma mantra said to have been taught by Bodhaayaana according to tradition.  
So it is not that 'pinaaka' may mean Siva only for lay persons sa you say; but by the Veda-s and by convention, 'pinaaka' and 'pinaakii' only refer to Siva, just as 'cakrii' and 'cakrapaaNi' mean only Vishnu by convention.  
  
With the best wishes  
Ganesan
