Just I quoted the usage in classical Sanskrit as recorded by Amara the lexicographer of 5-6th century who had recorded the usage of the word in classical literature at his time. As Narayanan, has done, it can be split with grammar at any length as far as etymology can be afforded.

And one can resort to Vedic Vocabulary as given by Yaska and his commentators  and read and interpret accordingly with Vedic accents. And the same with etymology as provided by Yaska or Dictionaries in Comparative/Historical Linguists like Caldwell, Stuart etc.

  

Anyhow the poetry is to be apreciated at any rate.

  

Thanks for the suggestion.
