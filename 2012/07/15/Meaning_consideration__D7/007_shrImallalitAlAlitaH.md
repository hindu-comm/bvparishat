svAmI kAshikAnanda giri, a saMnyAsI from kAshI who now lives in mumbai, has written a commentary on it and it was published by some organization with translation of mUla.  
svAmI is a great scholar who has many sanskrit works in his name including commentaries and independent works on advaita-vedAnta, yoga, tantra and bhakti-shAstra.  
When madhva-s challenged jagadguru-sha\~NkarAchArya-s in near past, he replied instead of them. And there was some written shAstrArtha between them via letters for long time.  
We have heard that while replying questions related to advaita-siddhi, he used shlokas only in his student life in an examination.
