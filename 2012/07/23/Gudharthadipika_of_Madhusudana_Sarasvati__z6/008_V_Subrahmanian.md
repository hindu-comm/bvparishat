In the Kaivalya Upanishad we have the famous mantra:  
  

    While looking for references in the Upanishads for the concept of
    'bhakti' as connected with 'jnanam' this is a useful one from the Kaivalya
    Upanishad:

    अचिन्त्यमव्यक्तमनन्तरूपं शिवं
    प्रशान्तममृतं ब्रह्मयोनिम् ।
    तथाऽऽदिमध्यान्तविहीनमेकं विभुं
    चिदानन्दमरूपमद्भुतम् ।।६।।
    7
    उमासहायं परमेश्वरं प्रभुं
    त्रिलोचनं नीलकण्ठं प्रशान्तम् ।
    ध्यात्वा मुनिर्गच्छति भूतयोनिं
    समस्तसाक्षिं तमसः परस्तात् ।।७।।
    8
    स ब्रह्मा स शिवः सेन्द्रः सो ऽक्षरः
    परमः स्वराट् ।
    स एव विष्णुः स प्राणः स कालो ऽग्निः स
    चन्द्रमाः ॥८॥

    The Mahanarayana Upanishad also has a very considerable bhakti-upAsanA saguNa content.  The  

Narayana/Sri/Durga suktams are an example. The Rg.Veda has the Saraswati and Ganapati Suktams. There is also the Rudra sUktam of the Rg Veda and the famous Sri Rudra prashnaH describing in very great detail the vishvarUpa and ekarUpa of Lord Shiva.  
  
In the Veda/Upanishads we have a large content of upaasana of saguNa brahman which form the vishaya vAkyas of several of the Brahma sutra Bhashyam. Generally it is held that the upAsanA sadhana is a part of vAnaprastha ashrama. The Advaitic view is that saguNa upAsanA done as a sole sadhana leads one to Brahma loka and from there to final moksha.
When the same upAsanA is done along with vihita karma too, it becomes chittashuddhi kAraNam and prepares one to embark on the jnAna sAdhana.
Shankara has commented on some of the IshAvAsyopanishad in this tenor.
