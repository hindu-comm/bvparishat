Respected Schoars,

Karma, Upasana and jnana are indeed the three basic divisions of knowledge .

In my personal study I find that subjects covered byAtharv Vedaare
also about  jnana, indeed  like the basic Rig Veda. However Atharva Veda further amplifies on most topics of jnana and can be viewed as Rig Veda knowledge often repeated to lay emphasis on some important jnana . This happens in four ways.

1\. Some Rig Ved Mantras are quoted in different aspects and form part ofnew sookts in Atharv Veda.

2\. It is alsofound that complete Sookts from Rig Ved are repeated in Atharva Veda. This can be illustrated by Manyu Sookts Rig Ved 10.83, 10.84 being verbatim found in Atharv Ved as 4.32, 4.31. Manyu is today a very misunderstood term.Buddhist emphasis of अहिंसा परमोधर्मा has distorted understanding of ahimsa.Vedas never told man to shy away from taking arms against injustice. This is what Manyuis all about . In common language Manyu is considered a synonym of anger. Then how one praysin Yajurveda मन्युरसि मन्युमयिधेहि?

3\. Then there are Rig Ved Sookts that are amplified in Atharv Veda. An excellent example is Rig Ved 10.109 of 8 mantras amplified to 18 mantras in Atharva Veda as 5.17. The subject is Girl Child from conception to motherhood.

4\. Then there are many topics of jnana relating to health medicine, society etc that are added to human knowledge by Atharv Veda. Thus in a very unintellectual sense one may get away by suggesting that Atharv Veda is basically an extension of Rig Veda.  
I am taking the opportunity to share with this mail, the two topics of Manyu and Girl Child mentioned above.
