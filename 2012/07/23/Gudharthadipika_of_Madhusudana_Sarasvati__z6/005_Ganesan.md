In this context, especially the concept of Bhakti, the Svetasvataropanishad is the first one that clearly defines Bhakti in the context of Rudra as the highest Reality, and uses the word 'Bhakti' and 'paraabhakti', etc.  
The other Upanishad-s such as the Atharvasikhaa, Atharvasiras, Kaivalya also ancient ones, referred many times in the Kuurmapuraana, Vayupuraana, and also cited as authority by some ancient commentators, 
follow it.  
As the final verse of the Svetasvataropanishad puts it categorically,  
  

 यदा चर्मवदाकाशं वेष्टयिष्यन्ति मानवाः ।  
 तदा शिवमविज्ञाय दुःखस्यान्तो भविष्यति ॥  

  
the supreme Bhakti on Deva (Siva) leads one to \[transforms into ?\] the realising Jnaana of Siva and only by that realisation can one cross the misery of samsaara.  
  
One can definitely say these are that the earliest utterances on the very concept of Bhakti, and all other systems following it developing this concept in many ways.
