Dear Scholars,  
In the tradition of the Saiva Agama- (Saivasiddhanta tradition), they are generally divided into four divisions:  
Jnaana, Yoga, Kriyaa and Caryaa as stated in the Mrigendraagama:  
  
  त्रिपदार्थं चतुष्पादं प्राह तन्त्रं जगत्पतिः ।  
  
Though some of the Agama-s as they are available now, do not contain such a strict division, generally they are found to expound these matters.  
There is also another division of the Saiva Agama-s followed by certain commentators such as Sivagra Yogi of the 16th century.  
It is the tripartite division:  

1.  Tantrakalaa which contains the entire ritual section (Kriyaa) and
    the Caryaa (personal conduct of the initiated Saiva and special
    rites). 2.  Mantrakalaa which treats the Mantra-s of the system as well as the
    Yoga, meditation, etc. 3.  Upadesakalaa that expounds the philosophical doctrines of the Saiva
    Siddhanta tradition (Jnaana)  

  
Ganesan
