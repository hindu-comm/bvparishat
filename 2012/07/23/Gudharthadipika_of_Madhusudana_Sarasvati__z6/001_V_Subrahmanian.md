This could be of help in determining:  
  
योगास्त्रयो मया प्रोक्ता नॄणां श्रेयोविधित्सया । *  
ज्ञानं कर्म च भक्तिश्च* नान्योपायोऽस्ति कर्हिचित॥ (११.२०.६)  
  
This appears in the Uddhavagita portion of the SrimadbhAgavatam)  
  
Also in the Bhagavatdgita 4th chapter beginning itself the Lord has said:  
  
इमं विवस्वते योगं प्रोक्तवानहमव्ययम् ।  
विवस्वान् मनवे प्राह मनुरिक्ष्वाकवेऽब्रवीत् ॥  
  
स कालेनेह महता योगो नष्टः परन्तप ।  
  
And सर्वे वेदा यत्पदमामनन्ति....in the Bh.Gita itself.  
  
From all this we can say that the Veda itself has the three-fold upAya consisting of karma, bhakti and jnanam for moksha. All these are to be taken as One and not each as a separate upAya for moksha.  
  
So, I think the three-fold division is already there, as approved by Bhagavan, and that is the tradition all the Acharyas follow, including Madhusudana.
