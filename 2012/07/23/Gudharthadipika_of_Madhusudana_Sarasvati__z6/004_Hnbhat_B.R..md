Karma, Upasana and jnana are indeed the three basic divisions of knowledge .

  

However Atharva Veda further amplifies on most topics of jnana and can be viewed as Rig Veda knowledge often repeated to lay emphasis on some important jnana .

  

It is the common practice of मीमांसा which ha set out to decide the  
Vedic Injunctions mainly, in कर्मकाण्ड which has set forth a guideline to be followed to decide the emphasis of the topic:\\

  

उपक्रमोपसंहारौ अभ्यासोऽपूर्वता फलम् । अर्थवादोपपत्ती च लिङ्गं तात्पर्यनिर्णये ॥

  

किसी भी ग्रंथ का तात्पर्य निकालना हो तो उसका आरंभ, अंत, अभ्यास का नावीन्य, फल, अर्थवाद और उपपत्ति - इन सात बातों को साधन बनाकर निर्णय करना चाहिए

  

which had been followed by the traditional commentators. Each decide upon their interpretations supported by quotations favoring their arguments and arrive at a conclusion.

  

आरण्यक section deals with ज्ञानकाण्ड and some sections with उपासना as their topic. But संहिता-sections deal with a variety of topics and are used in different rites prescribed in the ब्राह्मण section, which are discussed in detail by जैमिनि in his द्वादशाध्यायी and the commentators on it while ज्ञानकाण्ड in the आरण्यक section is dealt with in ब्रह्मसूत्र-s of बादरायण as categorized under different topics dealt with them. Now, पाञ्चरात्र-s, depend on भक्तिसूत्र-s by नारद, though it has not been commented by popular commentators, which lays the foundation for भक्ति cult which does not obviously deal with उपासना-section of वेद-s in any way, but mostly on general statements based on भागवत.

  

Now the question is where the concept of भक्ति is to be found in वेद-s, though it does not form a part of उपासना-काण्ड of आरण्यक-s. There are many उपनिषत्-s dedicated explicitly to नारायण, गोपाल, नृसिंह, राम etc. which could be easily interpreted in terms of भक्ति-cult.

  

This is my precise reply to the question. I don't think there is such division as named भक्तिकाण्ड, seems to be as explained in भक्तियोग, in Geeta:

  

मय्यर्पितमनोबुद्धिः etc. explicitly

  

मन्मना भव मद्भक्तः etc. in the 13th Chapter.

  

though उपासनाकाण्ड is abstract in concept in उपनिषत्-s seem to be related to object of meditation.
