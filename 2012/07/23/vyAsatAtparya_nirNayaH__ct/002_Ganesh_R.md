Dear Sri Subrahmanian,  
  
This is just to bring it to your kind notice. Vid. N. ranganatha Sharma has brought out a Kannada translation of Vyaasa-taatparyanirNaya and this is very good as it is self sufficient to understand the text and the logic underlying in it. He has also published original separately. Both are published by Udayaprakaashana, Bangalore.  
  
regards  
  
ganesh.
