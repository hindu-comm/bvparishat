Dear Sir,

There are ample works on elephants. Palakapya, a pioneer of elephantology is considered to be a tribesman. He elaborately discusses about the elephants, their habits, diseases etc., in his works Gajashastram and Gajayurveda and other texts. You may please go through these books. These are also available in different libraries. Further Kautilya's Arthashastra also brings about a detailed relationship between the elephant catchers and the administrative members in maintaining the elephant population in the forests.

Hope this information will cater your needs.

Dhanyawad.
