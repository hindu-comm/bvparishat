Dear Sir,

The best thing to get answers for these queries is to contact some Forest Dept.Officials from Assam and Kerala,which still abound in elephants,their catchers, trainers etc.

Some Agricultural Universities from these States could also be contacted for this purpose.Am sure,they will have some details about these aspects.

Thanks and regards,

  

Prof. Siddharth Y.Wakankar
