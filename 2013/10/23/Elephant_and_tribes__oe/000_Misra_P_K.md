Dear Sirs,  

While doing research on the tribes in India, I discovered that elephants have been used as part of war machinery in India and also as insignia of royalty. It is considered sacred animal and has been part of the Hindu temples, and is widely depicted in the Hindu templearchitecture
Obviously there must have been close connection between those who used elephants, the suppliers ( catchers and trainers) and traders of elephants.There must have been dedicated markets forelephants too.I would like to know specific references and also names of the communities of suppliers, catchers and trainers of elephants. Any help in this regard from the scholars will be greatly appreciated.

My interest is to show the linkages between the larger Indian society and the forest dwellers who have been called as tribes since the colonial period.
