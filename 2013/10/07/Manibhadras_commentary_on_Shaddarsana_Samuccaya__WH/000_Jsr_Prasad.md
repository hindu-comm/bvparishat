Respected All,  
  

NamAmsi. '*Shaddarsana Samuccaya'* of Haribhadra Suri has been translated by eminent scholars like Prof. Sacchidananda Murthy, Prof. Siva Kumara Swamy etc. into English. Some of you may be aware that a Sanskrit commentary on this text, called '*laghu vrtti'* has been authored by Manibhadra. Just wondering, whether this has been translated into English by any scholar. I would also like to know about any other Sanskrit translations on the original text.  
  

Regards,  

Anjaneya Prasad
