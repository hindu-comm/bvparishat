Dear Joshiji,  
  
The Sakas are mentioned in the ancient texts but they came to reckoning as people with power during the time the Satavahanas. That is what the Puranas say, though offhand I do not recall the puranic details. Some historians call the Kushanas also as Sakas. The Sakas of the Satavahana times are the later people and their relation with the Kushanas have not been established.  
  
  
Further as you are aware of the Iranian History you could also be aware that the Assyrian empire collapsed when the joint forces of the Babylonians, Scythians and Medes captured Nineveh in 612 BCE. and with that the Scythians came to prominence.The Median kingdom was conquered by Cyrus, the Great thus forming the Archaemenid empire in 551 BCE.
That very year Cysus's father died and he became the king of the Archaemenian empire. Some scholars believe that year to be the start of the Cyrus- era. The archimenians chased part of the Scythians to the north of their empire and other part of them (i.e., the Indo Scythians, referred to in the Indian History as the Sakas) settled towards the east of Iran and southern Afghanistan. There is their place Sakastan (or Seista in Southern Afghanistan. Cyrus-I conquered upto the Indus (Sindhu) and Darius-I extended their empire somewhat further to the east of Indus and they appointed the Satraps to govern the different areas of their country. The Satrapy XX was in India and the Sakas were the Satraps. To my knowledge, that is how the later Sakas enetered India.  
  

I think I have answered you questions. If you wist to have more discussions on the history of the Sakas, I am afraid you may have to open a new thread, as otherwise the moderaotrji may not approve of it.  
  

Thanks,
