Pranam.

Shatchakra Nirupanam (an ancient text), edited or published by John Woodroffe<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_John_Woodroffe>has some relevance.

  

As rightly said, Lalita Sahasranama and similar Puranas mention the serpent power.

  

Whereas Yoga Sutra Darshanam (of Patanjali) has more mind control concepts, rather than physical.

  

In the Ashta Angas, First set of Four Yama, Niyama, Aasana, Praanaayaama are predominantly physical, to attain mind control.

Later Four Pratyaahaara, Dhyaana, Dhaarana and Samaadhi are purely mental activities; **where Patanjali's emphasis** lies.

  

Rest all can be assumed, as needed.

  

Praanaayaama's importance is espoused thru Shat Chakras. Moreover, the Kundalini is meta physical; to be proved thru human anatomy. The concept can be appreciated, to practise Praanaayaama, to instill the mind.

  

Subham.
