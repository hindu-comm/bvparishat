Historicity of a given text or word is equally important. A useful discussion might be to fix the word Kudalinis lower and upper limit and find out the historicity of the traditions and cults involved and how many cult and Tantric practices outside the system of Advaita and
Patanjali Yoga have come into the system. Was it due to Tantric Influence and how old and when such an influence did take place within reasonable assumptions.  
  
Traditions have its place and role. The question raised here was not about Yogic practices or popular practices followed Sringeri or any other Mutt.It is not enough if one says a particular religious organization and their Paramapara is the bar to measure historicity of given word and its usages .Many modern texts are given the title upanishads they may not be old texts . We have even Allah Upanishad for instance.
