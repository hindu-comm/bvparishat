I think more than historicity it is important to consider whether shiShTa-s are practicing the particular system. In the LalitAsahasranAma (LS) itself we get the name: शिष्टेष्टा शिष्टपूजिता.
The practice of kundalini without discordance with the aupaniShada sAdhana has been seen to be in vogue in traditional circles, as for example, in the Sringeri paramparA. There and in many other institutions and countless households the practice of LS involved worship is quite popular.  
  

In the English book titled 'Yoga, Enlightenment and Perfection' which details the spiritual practices and attainment / culmination of the previous Jagadguru Sri Abhinava Vidyatirtha Swaminah has a chapter on HaTha yoga and another on 'Exposure to Kundalini yoga'. These two chapters cite verses extensively from texts such as:  
  

Yogatattva upanishad, Yoga kundalini upanishad, HaThayogapradIpikA, Kalicharana's commentary on the ShaTcharanirUpaNa which cites from the yAmala texts too, the Rg.Veda 1.164.45 (for parA-pashyantI-madhyamA-vaikharI (चत्वारि वाक्परिमिता पदानि....), the YogachUDAmani upanishad, the brahmavidyA upanishad, etc.  
  

The Acharya-s concerned have accepted these texts as authorities that conform to and guide and confirm these yogic practices.
