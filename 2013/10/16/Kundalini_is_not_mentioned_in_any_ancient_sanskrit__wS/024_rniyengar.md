If you say that there is no reference to "Kundalini" in the currently available printed texts the manuscripts of which are dated prior to 4-5th Cent., perhaps it is acceptable as a verifiable fact. But this in no way can be an evidence for the argument that it originated after the above date. I give an example to underline my argument. The first reference to 'salt' appears (to the best of my knowledge) in the S'atapatha Braahman.a, which every one agrees is later than the R.gveda. But there are no reference to Uus.aa or Lavan.a in RV. Corrections requested if I am wrong.
