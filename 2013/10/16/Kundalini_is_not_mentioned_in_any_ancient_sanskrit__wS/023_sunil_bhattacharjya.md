1)  
The Dwaraka peeth and the Puri peeth has the Guru-parampara lists going upto 2,500 years ago. The Shringeri peeth, on the other hand, in fact, gave out different guru paramapra lists at different times, which conflict with each other. At one time the guru-parampara was shown as starting from 44 BCE and later on as starting from the 8th century.  
2)  

Secondly,, you (Dr. T. Ganesan) asked as to on what basis is it held that Gaudapaada, the paramaguru of Adi Shankara, had written the Sri Vidya texts? In that context please see what is given in the book "A companion to Tantra" by S.C.Banerji. For your ready reference I quote that as follows:  
  

Quote  
Besides the well-known Gaudapada-karika and a few other philosophical works, he was the author of the Tantric work, Srividya-ratna-sutra or Gaudapada-sutra, also called sakti-mimansa,  
Unquote  

3)  

Thirdly you (Dr.T.G.) also wrote that date of Shankara is an age -old dispute for which there is no clinching evidence, either textual or historical, till date.  

  

In reply I have to say that though the Shankaracharya's date looked like a contentious issue to many in the recent past and many scholars discussed this in great details I have no doubt that Adi Shankara lived in the 6th century BCE and that is due to the guru-parampara lists of the two Shankara peeths vouching for it. Historically too there are evidences that Dharmakirti, a senior contemporary of Adi Shankaracharya, lived around 6th century BCE and this is in line with the date of Lord Buddha, who lived in the 19th century BCE The evidences for latter comes from the Rajatarangini, Dr. Narahari Achar's dating of Lord Buddha and my research on the Dotted Records, a paper on which was presented in the WAVES conference a few years ago..  
  

However if you want a detailed discussions on the date of Adi Shankara afresh, you can open a new thread on it shooting out the questions you may have. The moderatorji will not have any objection to opening a new thread on it.
