parishade namaH,

  

I am not an expert. Still, I want to inform scholars that Shri G Seshendra Sarma in his acclaimed research work titled *rAmAyaNarahasyAlu*has proved that the entire *sundarakANDa* of vAlmeeki *rAmAyaNam* is nothing but a symbolic glorification of *kunDalini*. Being the earliest secular work produced after the vedic literature, it is asserted that *rAmAyaNam* is closest to *Rgveda*.
From this it can be safely concluded that the science of *kunDalini* must have been in currency during the vedic period. Scholars may please some light on this aspect too. 

  

Sincerely

  

Ramachander Deekonda
