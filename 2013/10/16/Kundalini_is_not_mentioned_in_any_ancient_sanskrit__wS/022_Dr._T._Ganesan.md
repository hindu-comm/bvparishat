What are those evidences that show the date of Adi Samkara as 6th century BCE ?? Will be grateful to know a few of them.  
  
When Samkara's date itself is under dispute as you have rightly acknowledged, on what basis is it held that Gaudapaada, the paramaguru of Adi samkara has written the Sri Vidya texts? In fact this is an age -old dispute for which there is no clinching evidence, either textual or historical, till date.
