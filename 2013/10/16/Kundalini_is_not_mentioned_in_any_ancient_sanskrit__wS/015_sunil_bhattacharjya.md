Dear friends,  
  
There has been dispute about the dates of Adi Sankara. Most of the evidences show that Adi Sankara was born in the 6th century BCE and his paramguru Gaudapadacharya was born still earlier. Gaudapadacharya had written on Sri Vidya (the Samatachara Tantra) as well as written a commenatry on the Uttara Gita, which treats the subject of Kundalini. Therefore it is not proper to emphasise that the concept of Kundalini is of recent origin.  
  

Secondly, the definition of Kundalini also differs from scholar to scholar. Some scholars trace the origin of the word to Kunda (or pit or cavity or secret place of residence), where the brain nestles in a coiled shape. According to these scholars, the Shakti which manifests in the Kunda (कुण्ड) as the Devi (Durga or Lalita or Saraswati), is the Kundalini (कुण्डलिनी).and at that stage the person is enlightened. Normally, of course, the Shakti lies dormant in the Mooladhara chakra, at the base of the spine and has to be forced to rise to the top of the spine by the various ways including specific pranayamas.
