I just realized that this thread is the origin of the other thread on Sankara's date. And I see some speculation on this thread as well, regarding the Vedic/Vedantic/Agamic/Tantric origin of the word Kundalini and Sricakra ritual practices. Yet I see nothing about some highly relevant textual sources that need to be highlighted here.



Sankara's bhAshya on gItA 8.10 - prayANakAle manasAcalena ... - प्रयाणकाले मरणकाले मनसा अचलेन चलनवर्जितेन भक्त्या युक्तः भजनं भक्तिः तया युक्तः योगबलेन चैव योगस्य बलं योगबलं समाधिजसंस्कारप्रचयजनितचित्तस्थैर्यलक्षणं योगबलं तेन च युक्तः इत्यर्थः, पूर्वं हृदयपुण्डरीके वशीकृत्य चित्तं ततः ऊर्ध्वगामिन्या नाड्या भूमिजयक्रमेण भ्रुवोः मध्ये प्राणम् आवेश्य स्थापयित्वा सम्यक् अप्रमत्तः सन्, सः एवं विद्वान् योगी 'कविं पुराणम्' इत्यादिलक्षणं तं परं परतरं पुरुषम् उपैति प्रतिपद्यते दिव्यं द्योतनात्मकम्।।पुनरपि वक्ष्यमाणेन उपायेन प्रतिपित्सितस्य ब्रह्मणो वेदविद्वदनादिविशेषणविशेष्यस्य अभिधानं करोति भगवान्



Note the reference to an UrdhvagAminI nADI in the bhAshya, which is not specifically mentioned in the gItA itself. Clearly, Sankara is referring to a specific meditative practice that scholars would more readily describe as "tAntric/yogic" than as "upanishadic/vedAntic". So, scholars like Sri Ganesan, please re-evaluate what you mean by these terms and re-examine your conclusions about the rituals and practices .



On the other hand, note that kuNDalinI is not a word explicitly used in the bhAshya. Neither arethe words sushumnAor cakra mentioned. Compare with madhusUdana sarasvatI - ऊर्ध्वगामिन्या सुषुम्नया ना़ड्या गुरूपदिष्टमार्गेण भूमिजयक्रमेण भ्रुवोर्मध्ये आज्ञाचक्रे प्राणमावेश्य .



However, also read brahmasUtrabhAshya and kaThopanishadbhAshya where Sankara does use the word sushumnA in the context of the nADI-s. In the taittirIyopanishadbhAshya,he simplydescribes this upward rising nADI as "yogaSAstreshu prasiddhA" (under the passage beginning sa ya esho'ntar hRdaya AkASaH \| tasminn ayaM purusho manomayaH \| ...).



The upanishadic meditation here is very obviously the same as or a precursor to what Agamic/tAntric texts describe under khecarI mudrA or lambika yoga. Again, scholars, please re-evaluate what you mean by upanishadic/vedAntic as against yogic/Agamic/tAntric. And indeed, pray, what are the yogaSAstra texts that Sankara had in mind when he commented on the taittirIya? If I were to proffer a particular candidate as a likely source for Sankara, would it be a text that contemporary scholars would like to call simply call "upanishadic" or "vedAntic" or even just "yogic" in preference to "tAntric" or "Agamic"? Or would scholars even be comfortable giving such a text a date between the 4th and 7th centuries CE? Yet, there had to have been pre-Sankaran texts that talked more extensively of nADI-s and sushumnA (and perhaps iDA and pingaLA and hastijihvA and other names as well) and Sankara thought it perfectly okay to cite them in his own vedAnta commentaries.



Moving on to a non-bhAshya text:verse 4.13 in mAnasollAsa, the commentary on the dakshiNAmUrti stotra, mentions the word kuNDalinI rising from the mUlAdhAra in the context of the nADI-s of the antaHkaraNa. Now, yes, the attributon of the dakshiNAmUrti stotra to Sankara and the mAnasollAsa to sureSvara have beed doubted by some scholars, but I have already pointed out numerous times that the reasons given to doubt these texts are highly circular arguments. They begin by presuming that any reference to nADI-s and meditative practices based on them are of non-Vedantic origin, because Sankara could not possibly have talked of them at all,and then they go on to conclude that these non-bhAshya texts cannot be authentic. Such argumentsconveniently ignore the profuse references to nADI-s in the sUtra bhAshya and key upanishad bhAshyas, thereby applying an inconsistent double standard to bhAshya texts and non-bhAshya texts that are traditionally ascribed to Sankara.



All in all, I would request scholars like Sri Ganesan to ask themselves the following questions.Are these practices and meditative techniques originally from aupanishada/saMnyAsI/yogI paramparA-s (not necessarily described in much detail in the vedAnta commentaries)thatfound their way to tantra/Agama texts?Or are these features of non-upanishadic meditative practices that found their way into vedAntic saMnyAsa traditions? Furthermore, if the direction of influenceis from a tAntrika/Agamika and therefore non-upanishadic milieu to a vedAntic saMnyAsin tradition, didsuch an influencenecessarily happen only in post-Sankaran times? If yes, when? And how would that help explain the bhAshya references that undoubtedly date back to Sankara? So, can we re-evaluate the contemporary scholarly consensus views of texts, traditionsand their histories by taking a more comprehensive view of all the available data?



Best regards,

Vidyasankar



ps. Regarding daNDa-s carried by saMnyAsins, please do not ignore the voluminous dharmaSAstra texts. There is a ton of information in them as well.
