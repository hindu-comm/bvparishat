Dear friends,  
  

Not all that comes in the name of Shankaracharya are by Adi Shankaracharya. One can probably be more sure about the 16 bhashyas (including those on the Vishnusahasranama, the 11 Upanishads, the Bhagavad Gita, the Brahmasutra, the Lalita Trishati and Sanat sujatiya) and a few other texts like Prabodha Sudhakara and Vivekachudamani as well as a few other compositions such as Mohamudgara being attributed to Adi Shanakaracharya. Scholars have reasons to doubt that the Saundaryalahari and the Dakshinamurti stotra and several other stotras might not have been Adi Shankaracharya's composition. For example the Devi aparadha kshamapana stotra tells us that the author was 85 years old and that author could have been Vidyashankara tirtha, who lived more than one hundred years.
