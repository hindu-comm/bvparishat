==============Note again========  

Kundalini is not the exclusive domain of Adavaita alone. We have received such posts which were denied.  
  
If members have views on Historicity of the word Kundalini please post. Always keep the focus of the thread in my mind. As I and Sampat have remarked this thread is about Historicity of the word Kundalini.  
  

Posts about the comparative use about the word in different Philosophical thoughts are welcome.
