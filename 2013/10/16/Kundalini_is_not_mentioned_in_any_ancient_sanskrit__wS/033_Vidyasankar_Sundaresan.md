Dear Bhattacharyaji,



Yes, I agree that a number of texts and stotra-s traditionally attributed to the name Sankaracharya could have been from the hands of later titular Sankaracharyas, not necessarily Sankara, the author of the sUtra bhAshya. The problem is that it is extremely difficult, if not impossible,to say which is which. My point is not that the traditional attributions should stand unquestioned. Rather I would like to emphasize that academic scholarship needs to be a lot more rigorous in the standards that it applies to evaluate authenticity and textual attribution. And contemporary scholars in academia need to review and readjust the conclusions reached by previous generations of scholars. Instead, what I see happening is the growth of a false consensus arising out of repetition and citation of the most prominent writers on a subject. Something that Paul Hacker offers as a tentative conclusion or that Sengaku Mayeda writes as a possible reconstruction becomes, through the act of citation and review, established as something thathas been proved beyond doubt, no matter whatlegitimate evidence is presented to the contrary by others.



Obviously, this can be generalized to apply to a whole variety of texts and traditions from India, not just the corpus arising from the advaita vedAnta sampradAya-s.



Please also note a couple of other points.



1\. Most academic scholars will take issue with your lumping together the prasthAna trayI bhAshya-s with the bhAshya-s on vishNu sahasranAma, lalitA triSati andsanatsujAtIya, prakaraNa texts like prabodhasudhAkara and vivekacUDAmaNi as well asSlokas like the mohamudgara.



2\. A traditional viewpoint, as well as academic sholarship,will also take issue with the enumeration of bhAshya-s on 11 Upanishat-s, although for different reasons. If you are including a commentary on the SvetASvatara, there is a traditional reason to say that Sankara did not write this one. If you are including a commentary on the nRsimha pUrvatApanI text among the 11, academic scholarship will be skeptical about it.



Best regards,

Vidyasankar
