*Now, yes, the attributon of the dakshiNAmUrti stotra to Sankara and the mAnasollAsa to sureSvara have beed doubted by some scholars, but I have already pointed out numerous times that the reasons given to doubt these texts are highly circular arguments. They begin by presuming that any reference to nADI-s and meditative practices based on them are of non-Vedantic origin, because Sankara could not possibly have talked of them at all,and then they go on to conclude that these non-bhAshya texts cannot be authentic. Such argumentsconveniently ignore the profuse references to nADI-s in the sUtra bhAshya and key upanishad bhAshyas, thereby applying an inconsistent double standard to bhAshya texts and non-bhAshya texts that are traditionally ascribed to Sankara.

Leaving other points for the present, and without any circular arguments, let me put a few simple questions:  

1.  How and why did Samkara suddenly *hit upon* the idea of addressing
    DakShiNAmUrti form of Siva as GurumUrti, while in all his
    bhAShya-s--BSbh and those on the UpaniShads--his conscious eschewing
    of any reference to Saiva theme or idea or practice is so clearly
    evident ? (while he clearly refers to some VaishNava themes and
    ideas). The KenopaniShad reference to the UmA-HaimavatI and the
    YakSha episode, which should have been so handy for Samkara, to
    which I had referred in my discussions sometime last year in the
    same group.  
2.  If DakShiNAmUrti is considered to be the AcArya of Advaita Vedanta
    tradition since Samkara addresses Him as GurumUrti in each 4th pada
    of the said stotra, then, why in the present day the standard verse
    on GuruparamparA of Advaita, "नारायणं पद्मभुवं . . . . " never
    mentions DakShiNAmUrti, or any form of Siva at all ? Probably is
    this a pointer to the difference between the AdiSamkara, the author
    of the Bsbh, and of bhAshya-s on some UpaniShads and the founder of
    the Samkara MaTha-s ??  
3.  How does Samkara suddenly say in the DakShiNAmUrtyaShTaka "
    भूरम्भांस्यनलोऽनिलोऽम्बरमहर्नाथो हिमांशुः पुमान् इत्याभाति
    चराचरात्मकमिदं यस्यैव मूर्त्यष्टकम् । while nowhere in the BSbh or
    in any UpaniShadbhAShya he never mentions this very ancient idea of
    Siva's aShTamUrti, so often referred and discussed in many ancient
    PurANa-s, as there are many occasions in the UpaniShadic
    commentaries where one would very expect Samkara to do, which so
    strongly establishes the 'sarvaatmatva', sarvavyaapakatva of Brahma
    so directly, to which concept KAlidAsa, before Samkara, repeatedly
    refers in his works ? But on the contrary, as many of us know,
    Samkara firmly says that the universe is only mithyA and a false
    appearance on Brahma. Evidently, the aShTamUrtitva and
    jaganmithyAtva cannot go together.  
4.  Also the passage in the second verse of the DakShiNAmUrtistotra,
    मायावीव विजृम्भयत्यपि महायोगीव यः स्वेच्छया is a clear indication of
    the Pratyabhij\~nA concept and not of Advaita Vedanta one. Refer to
    the well known verse of the Isvarapratyabhij\~nAkArikA, 1:5:7 of
    UtpalAcArya:

   \`     चिदात्मैव हि देवोऽन्तःस्थितमिच्छावशाद्बहिः ।   
       योगीव निरुपादानमर्थजातं प्रकाशयेत् ॥
