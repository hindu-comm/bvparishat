My question was when "Kundalini" as a concept we have it in use today,
first evolve. Was it a part of Patanjali Yoga tradition or was the concept borrowed from Tantrik texts or by Hatha yoga practitioners from their texts. Can Kundalini be traced to any old upanishad texts?  
  
When I meant Hatha Yoga I do not mean Hatha yoga Pradipika. I meant Hatha yoga as a practice.
