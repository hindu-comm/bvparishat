Dear Vidyashankaji,  
  

Yes, the list can appear to be subjective and there can be questions.  

  

The figure of 16 bhshyas of Adi Shankara came from Chitsukhacharya himself. There can be an issue over the inclusion of the Svetasvatara upanishad as against the Nrsimhapurvatapania. If these two are left out then the Shankarabhshya on the Sankhya-karika can take a place among the 16. I have my own doubt about the Shankara-bhashya on the Yogasutra.  
  

Regards,
