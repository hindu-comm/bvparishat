For those who wish to reconstruct history, it is important to determine where a particular term first occurs and what the age of the text(s) in which it seems to occur first is/could be. However, it should always be borne in mind that such a determination only establishes the lower limit ('cannot be later than' kind of limit) of a concept or thing and that absence of mention does not mean absence of a concept or thing. X can exist under some other name, or could have been conveyed by a phrase, clause, sentence or passage or could have been a part of the ancient world in some context that was not discussed in surviving texts. Indiscriminate use of absence has caused much harm in reconstructing the history of India. Noticing absence enables us to ask potentially useful questions (and, therefore, absences should be noted), but generally not to provide definite answers.  
  
I do not mean to say that the participants in the present discussion have depended on absence without proper consideration. I only wish to sound a note of caution if the query was made with the intention of drawing historical inferences.
