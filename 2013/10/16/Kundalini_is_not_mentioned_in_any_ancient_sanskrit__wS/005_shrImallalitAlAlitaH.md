As far as I know, kuNDalinI is a subtle form of devI and it is common to tAntra-s where worship of devI is seen in form of kuNDalinI.  

There is a concept that chit-shakti resides in mUlAdhAra-chakra otherwise known as kula-chakra and shiva resides in sahasrAra-chakra otherwise called akula-chakra. No doubt, this chakra-concept is also original to tantra-works. chakra-s are abode of specific devatA-s and devatA-s are worshiped at those places to get specific results. The union of shiva and shakti is the ultimate stage according to tantra, and is otherwise called shiva-shakti-sAmarasyam. This sAmarasya of shiva and shakti is meditated upon. They meditate that devI, i.e. kuNDalinI rises to sahasrAra and unites with shiva. This type of meditation is a worship itself and has various results. Ultimately it stabilizes the mind of sAdhaka on the sAmarasyam. Similar to yogI-s, where samAdhI is means and stabilization is called moxa and hence is goal; tantra-s say that stabilization in that state is a goal itself. Apart from that there are worldly results also.  

tantra-s don't mention mUla-bandha-s, etc. to rise kuNDalinI, as is popular today. They talk about meditation only and regard this as worship which has many results. While yogI-s say that kuNDalinI is something sleeping, not essentially goddess but just a serpent, and we have to force her to come out of sleep by using prANAyAma and bandha-s, then it will go to sahasrAra and will reside there, this will give siddhi-s.  

So, there is a big difference between both concepts. As far as I can see, there is no proof that kuNDalinI concept is original to yoga. They have just taken it from tantra-s without recognizing it's other parts. And with the grace of new yoga movements starting from rAmakR^iShNa paramahaMsa and vivekAnanda and our lust to get siddhis-s, we are bound to think that it is something related to yoga.  

Bengal has tantra-paramparA. And if somehow the tAntrika concept was mingled with yoga by them, it is not something unexpected.  

Another thing I can say that, other parts of tantra were not accepted by yogi-s just because they felt embarrassment while talking about sAmarasya and pa\~ncha-makAra.
