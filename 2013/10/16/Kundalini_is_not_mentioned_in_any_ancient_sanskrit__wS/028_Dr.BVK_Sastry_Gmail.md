Namaste



On ShankaraBhashya and non-mention of Kundalini issue : Long and involved thread with some critical issues needing clarity. 



1. Three specific reasons to look at this thread carefully : (a)
discussion is drifting towards issues of yoga-practice, details of which are not intended for ‘ academic curiosity’ (yoga Sutra 1-49)
(b) There is a mix up of Yoga-technicalities ( as noted in Patanjali Yoga Sutra), Vedanta ( of one school :Advaita), Tantra (unspecified out of several tantra works and modalities) and Srividya practice ( preference seems to be for the Vedanta integrated model as used in Sringeri, and in relation to the tradition aligned to Sri Bhaskara raya makhin, Hyderabad). (c ) Sidleining the wide time gaps of the order of centuries between Patanjali –Acharya Shankara (as generally understood); where in thee is all plausible reasons to believe the confluence of Tantra practices getting mixed with Yoga-Vedanta practices. Bhojas commentary on Yoga sutra is an example of this confluence of thoughts . There seems to be plurality of understanding and divergence in constructing the technicalities of core traditional practices and technical terms of the practice, especially Kundalini.



The yoga sutra 1-36 (vishokaa vaa jyotishmatee ) and 3-32 ( moordha jyotishi siddha darshanam ) need to be looked at as practice guidance and experience check points rather than narrative of yoga journey sign posts to simply cross without any validation. In Kundalini process, the ‘ laya’ of the mantra-varnas’ is provided as a technique for this from moola aadhara to sahasrara (also called as Vak-Yoga paddhati / Kashyapa paddhati) .



From this perspective, Kundalini is a yoga practice, which is described in different shastra sampradayas with different technical terminologies. The artificial historic timing – and antecedent positioning of one shastra in relation to another shastra may not be the intention of traditional schools. There is a critical need to understand the ‘paribhashaa’ = technical Samskrutham of each discipline beyond the social format of ‘Sanskrit’ and use of ‘ translation’.
Shaastra is a ‘Darshana = visioning process and practice –guidance ’ ; It is NOT an intellectual argumentative philosophy. 



Here is a humble effort to share my thoughts.



2. The passage of Shankara Bhashya quoted may have to be looked at in relation to what is said in Yoga Sutra – references mentioned side by side below. What had happened to the practice and understanding of
Yoga-Sutras as ‘Vedanta darshana Sadhana’ from (i) Bhagavad-Gita to Patanjali and then from (ii) Patanjali to Acharya Shankara needs to be studied carefully. There are gas of several centuries! There are many new practices that have come up as Tantra, Agama. There are several interpretations, pushing the ‘practice to the background’ and
prioritizing the ‘ debate’ !



Here is a connecting link from Acahrya Shnakara bhashya segments to the Yoga Sutras.

3. The practices of Kundalini yoga / Sri Vidya esoteric / aagama /Vedanta do overlap. The terminologies like ‘Kundalini’, Avarana, AdhishThana, upa-samkramana, are indicative of different paths, which push the ‘inward journey of laya : internalized abstraction and progress through the checkpoints of Samadhi – Kaivalya and Beyond. Each phase of journey needs different ‘ anushAsana – anushThana:: guidance and practice’.



In Advaita terminology, the journey beyond kaivalya is linked with ‘ maha vakya- smriti linked anushAsana / upadesha ’. While technicalities can vary across each shaastra for debate in intellectual parlor ( with active intellect = Buddhi guarding the aham-kAra), the guidance for journey to ‘ yo buddheh paratastu saH’ ( =Gita 3-42 ) is sidelined.



4. This ‘ anushAsana’ for transcendence of ‘Buddhi ( the deeper technicality of Chitta, Bhaavanaa, Drik-Drushya darshana viveka, Shiva-shakti samAyoga, Kundalini in Sahasrara and beyond (?),
Lokaantara, Kosha upasamkrana, Tureeyaaateeta sthiti etc ) is detailed in the technicality of ‘Kundalini –Chakra Bheda addahti’. If one intends to explore, more details can be seen in Arthur Avalon : The Serpent power – Appendix : the summary six or so slokas which, explain Sookshma- Kundalini- swaroopa as ‘ Vaak-roopaa /Varna roopa..’ and how this needs to be transcended.



 In terms of Yoga-Sutra itself, it is transcending the ‘ smriti’ ( the last of the chitta vrutti’s).



 In Tantra, it is going beyond the pancha bhoota tattva of Aakasha. In Vedanta ( cf:Taittiriya) it is the phase of ‘aakasha shareeram Brahma’ and beyond.



 It is also the sixth aspect of ‘Brahma jijnAsaa ‘ which Varuna teaches Bhrigu but not much detailing is available in the original text itself. (The original text instruction is : annam prAnah, Chakshuh shrotram, mano vacham iti. The Vacham part of Bhrigu’s tapas / vijijnAsaa is not elaborated. The only clue that is seen in the original text is ‘ saama gaayan aaste’ – where Saama is the ‘Vak-darshana’. The word ‘annAda’ generally translated as ‘ one who consumes Food’ can also be explained as ‘ I am the nAda of ‘a’ kaara ( at- nAdaH)’. This unified identity of speaker and the speech expression and process is the ‘ key of a-vaachyataa ( what can not be articulated) – a-nirvachaneeyataa ( what can not be explained in any other way by any kind of description) for it is the transcending the split of speaker-speech and speaking process. The yato vacho nivaratate –phase.
