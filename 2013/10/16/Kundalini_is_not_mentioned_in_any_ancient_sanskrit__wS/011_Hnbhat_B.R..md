This is the Vikipedia article refers to the first usage in Sharadatilaka Tantra:

  

Use kuṇḍalī as a name of Durga or of a Shakti appears as a technical term in Tantrism and Shaktism as early as c. the 11th century, in the Śaradatilaka.\[10\] It is adopted as kuṇḍalniī as a technical term into Hatha yoga in the 15th century and becomes widely used in the Yoga Upanishads by the 16th century. Eknath Easwaran has paraphrased the term as "the coiled power," a force which ordinarily rests at the base of the spine, described as being "coiled there like a serpent".\[11\] The phrase serpent power was coined by John Woodroffe, who published his translation of two 16th-century treatises on Laya Yoga (Kundalini Yoga) in 1919 under this title.

The reference to Tantrasara found in Shabdakalpadruma:

  

"ध्यायेत् कुण्डलिनीं सूक्ष्मां मूलाधारनिवासिनीम्।

तामिष्टदेवतारूपां सार्द्धत्रिवलायान्विताम्॥

कोटिसौसामिनीभासां स्वयम्भूलिङ्गवेष्टिनीम्।

तामुत्थाप्य महादेवीं प्राणमन्त्र्ोण साधकः॥

उद्यद्दिनकरोद्योतां यावच्छ्वासं दृढासनः।

अशेषाशुभशान्तर्थं समाहितमनाश्चिरम्।

तत्प्रभापटलव्याप्तं शरीरमपि चिन्तयेत्॥" इति तन्त्रसारः॥
