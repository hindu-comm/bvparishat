The method of the kundalini yoga is not any different from the Upanishadic one. There is the prakRti tattva made of three gunas and pancha bhuta-s. The jiva, out of ignorance, identifies with the body-mind complex made of the five elements. The strongest of these identifications is with the gross body. The base instincts are the ones that occupy man at this stage of ignorance. The pancha kosha viveka method of the Vedanta is what is laid out in the kundalini with much correspondence with the chakras, the base being the mUlAdhAra,, he prithvI tattva, the grossest of the five. Then the aspirant is led to the higher chakras which correspond to the earlier elements: water, agni, vAyu and AkAsha, there being greater subtlety and purity comparatively, ascending. This is the same as the pancha kosha viveka where anna maya, prana maya, mano maya, etc. are subtler, purer and less binding. The culmination is in transcending the five koshas, the chakra-s and establishing in the highest, innermost, Atma tattva, the name given to it in the LalitasahasranAma is: panchakoshAntara-sthitA, sahasrArAmbujArUDha, brahmAtmaikyasvarUpiNI, nistariguNyA, pratyagrUpA, parAkAshA, etc.  
  

Thus the kundalini is the power, the Atmashakti of the Upanishads, that is retrieved from the clutches of the panchabhUta-s and accorded its native glory. Only that the names and method differ; the content is the same. Those who have practiced the upanishadic sadhana and the kundalini say that the one with the vedantic enlightenment has had the kundalini culmination too although he might not identify it the same way.
