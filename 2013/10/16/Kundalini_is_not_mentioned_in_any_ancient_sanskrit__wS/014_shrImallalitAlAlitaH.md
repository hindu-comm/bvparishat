I agree with whatever you said about upAsanA, mantra and AchAra of shrauta-sannyAsI-s.  

But, what is the meaning of kApila-sannyAsI ?  

Does it simply mean those who take sannyAsa according to shruti and smR^iti-s or it is a type of sannyAsa prescribed by tantra-Agama-s ?  

I'm asking this because the mudrA-s on daNDa of sannyAsI-s appear unrelated to shruti and smR^iti. It is expected that they have been brought from Agama-s. What are your views regarding this ?  

I'll be obliged if you share your views here or privately, anyway.
