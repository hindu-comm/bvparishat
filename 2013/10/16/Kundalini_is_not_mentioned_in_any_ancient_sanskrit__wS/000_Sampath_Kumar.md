Dear scholars

About Kundalini there is nothing mentioned in any ancient texts

including Patanjali.

Charaka- Sushruta and Vagbhata also not mentioned.

even they mentioned mahat-mūla prakruti-ahamkāra-buddhi-saptottara marmaśataṁ\[107\]-aṅgapratyaṅga-sira-snāyu-pēśa-sandhi-dhamani-dhātu, etc ......etc.....

i think -It is later yogic concept developed in around 4 or 5th century

any remarks and details are invited for the sake of the knowledge.
