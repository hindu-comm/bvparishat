Dear Dr. Ganesan,



I address each of your points in order and raise three more of my own at the end.



1\. Why should we speculate upon the how or why of something that happened centuries ago? For all you or I know, perhaps one fine day, Sankara had a vision or a dream and composed the stotra. Such things happen, do they not? Meanwhile, could I request you to take a fresh look at my response to you on the kenopanishad bhAshya passages from last year? To merely reiterate your stand that Sankararefers to vaishNava themes and ideaswhile trying to explain away how he does explain the presence of umA and the yaksha in the upanishat does not help matters at all. Just as herefers to the sAlagrAma stone in the brahmasUtra context of a pratIka for meditation on brahman, in the kenopanishat,he says umA = brahma-sahacAriNI, i.e. the yaksha there was brahman = Siva.Itis amusing to me that scholars who want to project Sankara as some sort of vaishNava (as opposed to Saiva) don't see the simple fact that hereally has neither a vaishNava nor a Saiva fixation. You are well aware that Sankara is quite critical of a number of pancarAtra texts and tenets as well.



2\. You really cannot have it both ways on the issue of the guru-paramparA verse. For the moment, let me ignore your unwarranted dichotomy between Sankara, the author of bhAshyas and Sankara, the founder of maTha(s). I could say a lot about it, but the only comment I will make instead is that this is equivalent to assuming thatevery singleprofessor who writes books and journal articles today is quiteincapable of setting up a university department devoted to his field of study! I leave it to scholars here to judge how right or wrong such an assumption can be.



The various Sankara maTha-s may differ amongst themselves about historical details, but they have a quite uniform tradition when it comes to the study of the vedAnta texts and the ritual practice associated with such study. The verse नारायणं पद्मभुवं . . . . comes from the tradition of the maTha-s, not from any of the bhAshya-s. The recitation of the dakshiNAmUrti stotra at the beginning of bhAshyapATha also comes from the very same tradition of the Sankara maTha-s. You cannot assign the origin of theनारायणं पद्मभुवं verse to the supposed vaishNava orientation of the author of bhAshya-s and the dakshiNAmUrti stotra to the supposedly Saiva angle introduced by a different founder of maTha-s. Such an argument simultaneously credits the maTha traditions with self-contradictory qualities: the paramparA as it exists todayis(a) credited with havingmaintained a reference to nArAyaNa in a guru paramparA verse that is not found in the bhAshya-s, but presumed to go back to their supposed vaishNavamilieu and (b) thought of as bringing in a supposedly Saiva (and non-Sankaran) inspired stotra to dakshiNAmUrti as an introduction to studying the same bhAshya-s!



Meanwhile, you also seem to conveniently ignore another guru paramparA verse, againfrom the same maTha traditions - सदाशिवसमारंभां ... What motivationcould a supposedly Saiva founder of maTha-s, who presumably did not write the bhAshya-s, have had for retaining or even composing a verse with nArAyaNa at the head of the guru paramparA? For such questions to be asked and given the intellectual room to generate solutions, one needs to modulate one's supposed scholarly and academic skepticism about traditional accounts with a healthyskepticism about the methodology and objectivity of scholarly activity itself. Don't you think the need for scholarship to hold a mirror to itselfis long overdue in studies of Indian traditions?   

3\. Come now, does the ashTamUrti concept necessitate a philosophicaljagat-satyatva position? And does jagan-mithyAtva in advaita vedAnta have no room to accommodate ashTamUrti anywhere in its rather wide concept of vyavahAra and saguNa brahman? This is a very flimsy argument to make, really.



There might be more strength in a textual argument, for example, that demonstrated that nothing similar is found anywhere in all the ten upanishad bhAshyas nor the gItAbhAshya nor the sUtrabhAshya. I might take that more seriously. However, please do not ask me to dig up some reference to the five elements plus the sun and moon and purusha as a group of eight in the bhAshya-s. I have seen enough instances of arguments against the traditional attribution of prakaraNa grantha-s to Sankara, whichclaim that some particular detailis never found in the bhAshya-s.These were easilyproved wrong when I went looking for evidence in the bhAshya-s, found them readily enoughand reflected that I am neither a vedAnta paNDita in the traditional mold nor aprofessional academic in the business of writing books and articles on Indian philosphy and history.



One example is that of pancIkaraNa. We have been told, by reputed and erudite scholars,that the sUtrabhAshya never refers to pancIkaraNa, that Sruti refers only to trivRtkaraNa, not pancIkaraNa, and that therefore it is impossible that Sankara could have written a grantha called pancIkaraNa. I have shown, in a paper written more than a decade ago, that inthe chAndogyopanishad bhAshya, Sankaradoes make a very specific reference to the process of pancIkaraNa, extending his explanation of trivRtkaraNa to cover pancIkaraNa, concluding that a samAna-nyAya applies to it as well. Please lookup Philosophy East and West issues from the year 2002, to find that article. Suffice it to say, I am quite skeptical when I see arguments that claim that such and such a thing is not to the found in the bhAshya-s at all, when offered as a reason to doubt the authenticity of a text traditionally attributed to Sankara. Much more tightly woven and text-specific arguments need to be given for questions of authorship and I haven't seen much so far that is really convincing.



4\. I would recommend looking at numerous places in BSBh where the non-event of the creation of the universe by brahman (in advaita) is compared to the illusory creations of a mAyAvI and to the creations of mahAyogI-s. And is it that much of a stretch to go from the upanishadic IkshaNa (tad aikshata) and kAma (so'kAmayata) to icchA?



Let me now draw your attention to other related questions.



a\. The first verse has aline, paSyann Atmani mAyayA bahirivodbhUtaM yathA nidrayA.Does thiscomparison of the observed universe to things seen in nidrAfit better with the advaita vedAnta of Sankara or the pratyabhijnA SAstra of utpala and abhinavagupta?



b.I'm surprised that you didn'tland onthe 6th verse as part of your argument. Is it becausethis verse alsofits in only with the vedAntic avasthA traya prakriyA (sanmAtraH ... ... prag asvApsam iti prabodhasamaye yaH pratyabhijnAyate) in spite of the explicit usage of a loaded word, pratyabhijnA, directly in this verse?



c\. You must be aware that Sankara is a champion of direct recourse to saMnyAsa, bypassing the gRhastha stage. Before thinking of this as yet another feature only of themaTha tradition, please look at thegItAbhAshya 3.3, where Sankara descibes the paramahaMsa parivrAjaka as "brahmacaryASramAd eva kRta-saMnyAsa" and to later passages in the gItAbhAshya, where he says there is a samuccaya/vikalpa option for saMnyAsa.Whenever hemakes these comments about saMnyAsa, the one Sruti text that he invariably cites in support is the jAbAlopanishad-"brahmacaryAd vA, gRhAd vA, vanAd vA ...yad ahareva virajet tad ahareva pravrajet."This is a lot more specific about the sequence or otherwise of the four ASrama-s than the bRhadAraNyaka sentence about vittaishaNa and putraishaNa that is also sometimes cited in the same context.



Now, what does this have to do with Saiva, vaishNava and Sankara's supposed avoidance of Saiva themes or texts? It is this. The jAbAlopanishadis one of those texts that modern scholarship willlabel as late, will it not?Of all the prior vedic, upanishadic, itihAsic, purANic or tAntricreligious motifs and worship patternsthat could have existed at the time ofthe jAbAlopanishat, thistext recommends only the recitation of the SatarudrIya for the saMnyAsin. Not the vishNu sahasranAma, not the worship of vishNu in a sAlagrAma stone, not the bhAgavata/pAncarAtra practices of ijya-abhigamana etc (whichSankara says are acceptable to vedAntins). To date, pArAyaNa of and abhisheka using the rudra hymn is a central feature of theworship practice in all the Sankara maTha-s.Right there, in a text that Sankara regards as Sruti, the one text that he specifically cites in support of his emphasis onsaMnyAsa directly from the student stage, lies a decidedly Saiva theme. A typical academicresponse to this evidence would be to ask whether the portion that talks of the SatarudrIya is original to the jAbAlopanishat and towonder whether it was interpolated by later Saiva sectarians.Such argumentsare merely wild attempts to clutch at straws,because the veda itself does have the rudra hymn in it.So, pardon me if all the available evidence, put together, confimsmy skepticism about the methodologies and conclusions of some of the past academic research that informs your opinions about these issues.



Best regards,

Vidyasankar
