Respected Sir,

As you want to know about available data of Vijayendra TIrtha of Kumbhakonam of 1539 C.E., you may refer New Catalgus Catalogurum Vol. XXIX. pp. 59-61. Reference of more than 40 works of Swamiji are recorded there. You may also refer the book namely History of Dvaita Literature of B.N.K. Sarma for more reference.

It is for your kind information that the New Catalgus Catalogurum volumes are published by University of Madras, which you can also collect from there.
