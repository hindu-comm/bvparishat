Thanks for the explanation. The 'space between the eye-brows', as I understand, is the upward end of the nose bone and the beginning of the forehead. This I think is not the same as the eye-ball, if अक्षिपात्रम् means eye-ball. Also, the word 'ऊर्णा' is given the meaning ''the circle of hair between the eyebrows.' in the Apte Dictionary which I mentioned in the first post. Could you kindly clarify on this Sir?
