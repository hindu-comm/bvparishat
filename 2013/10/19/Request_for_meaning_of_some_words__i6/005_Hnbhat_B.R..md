Sorry. I used by mistake, the space between the eye-lashes, i.e. the eyes themselves. is meant by अक्षिपात्र.

Not the eye-brows. like the river basin, between the two banks. Thanks for notifying this error.

  

ऊर्णा or ऊर्ण has different meanings as I have explained in my reply just posted.

  

But the the comparison is taken from Vyasabhashya, added उपमान for भोगसाधन, the ऊर्णातन्तु. which is the product of ऊर्णनाभ the spider worm or silk worm.

  

ऊर्ण can mean any hair. But the उपमा lies in the delicacy of the object fallen into the eyes and hence it would be proper in both cases, either the spider thread or silk thread, or any tiny part of it. No measurement is given strictly not intended for the comparison, but only delicacy of the object and the eyes.

  

With regards
