Dear Vidyasankarji'  
  

I had the apprehension that the Moderaterji would not like a fresh debate on the issue of the date of Adi Shankara as the issue might have been discussed in the forum (before I was a member of the forum) and in a private mail I expressed that apprehension to Dr. Ganesan too in a private mail but he asked me to seek the permission of the moderatorji (afresh). I did that and the moderatorji too in a private mail advised me to open a new thread on it. Yet I was reluctant but when Mr. Sampathkumar opened a new thread I joined the issue. Mind that I did not open the the new thread myself but just gave my reply to Mr. Sampathkumar as his claims on the dating of Adi Shankaracharya in the 8th century BCEon the basis of the Sundara Pandya's verses is unacceptable owing to the reasons I mentioned.  
  

Secondly, as regards Nakamura's work (which Ajitji mentioned) what I gathered after reading Nakamura's work quite sometime ago was that Nakamura tried to address the issue in a comprehensive way yet he failed to suggest any definite date for Adi Sankaracharya definitely and even raised some doubts on the 8th century date of Adi Shankara nothing beyond that.  
  

I know that there have been lot of past attempts in the form of book , articles / papers in journals and conferences for finding the date of Adi Sankaracharya but none has taken cognizance of the fact that all those discussions (attempts had ignored several facts. With all regards to the scholars who tried in the past to find the date Adi Sankaracharya I must say that they were complacent with their own views and avoided (for the reasons best known to them) addressing the uncomfortable issues connected with the date of Adi Shankaracharya. If however you and / or other scholars want to address these issues I can enumerate those afresh here (though I mentioned some of these alreadt) and that too provided the moderatorji permits that. My interest is guided only by the quest for the truth about date of Adi Shankaracharya and not in any loyalty to this Shankara math or that.  
  

Regards,
