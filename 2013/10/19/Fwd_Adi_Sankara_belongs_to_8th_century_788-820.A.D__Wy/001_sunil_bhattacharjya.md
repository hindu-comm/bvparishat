**Dear friends,  
  
According to Shringeri math /peeth Adi Shankara was born on the 14th year of reign of King Vikrama. That means there should have been one king Vikrama reigning from 775 CE, if Shankara was born in 788 CE, but there was no such Vikrama reigning from 775 CE. So Adi Shankara was not born in 788 CE.  
  
Further there was no Sundara Pandya in the 7th century. The early pandya kings mentioned in the Sangam literature and in the Mahavamsha were ruling aroung 6the century BCE.
