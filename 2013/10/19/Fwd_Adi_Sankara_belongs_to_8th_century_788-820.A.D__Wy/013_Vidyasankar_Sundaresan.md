In the interest of furthering scholarship and highlighting a little known journal article in this Parishat, here is the citation for the paper that I promised in an earlier mail.



Kengo Harimoto, **The Date of Sankara: Between the Calukyas and the Rastrakutas**, *Journal of Indological Studies*, No. 18, **2006**, pp. 85-111.



The reason I think this paper is important and interesting is this.It takes a fresh look at an old problem, highlighting little known facts of texts and history. Rather than the same old discussion about Srughna and Pataliputra (BSBh 2.1.17),and recognizing that these place names are much older than Sankara (they already found in the Mahabhashya, for example),Kengo Harimotofocuses on a rarely noticed quotation later in the brahmasUtra bhAshya -



tathA ca loke ... ..."gaccha tvam ito balavarmANaM tato jayasiMhaM tataH kRSNaguptam" iti (BSBh 4.3.5).



The context of the bhAshya discussion is arcirAdi krama in the devayAna, which implies a hierarchy from this balavarman to kRSNagupta. The author points out that there is recorded evidence of a vassal of the Calukyas called balavarman, and postulates thatjayasiMha was aCalukya king while kRSNaguptacould be a reference to the Rashtrakuta king, Krishna I, who defeated the Calukyas and reversed the older king-feudatory relationship between the Calukyas and the Rashtrakutas. \[To bring this history to a more popular understanding, the Rashtrakuta dynasty was responsible for the Ajanta and Elloracave templesthat are tourist spots today.\]If Kengo Harimoto's postulate is correct, it allows us to possibly narrow down the date of the BSBh, and therefore that of Sankara bhagavatpAda,to some period between 756 and 772 CE.



The only assumption involved is that Sankara was using the actual names of his contemporary south Indian chieftains and kings in his bhAshya. I do not find much that would argue against such an assumption. The names balavarman, jayasimha and kRSNagupta seem quite specific and are not stock examples. This isunlike Devadatta and Yajnadatta,the Toms, Dicks and Harrys of Indian philosophical writing. To completelyrefute the above argument, the proponents of a BC date for Sankara will have toshow evidence of the same three namesfrom a more remote time period and make those names fit in with the logic of the arcirAdi krama in the bhAshya.



Imaginea religious teacher in southIndia five years ago, talking aboutKarunanidhi (or Yedyurappa or Reddy) along withManmohan Singh and Pratibha Patil, in the course of explaining something to his disciples. The references to balavarman, jayasiMha and kRSNagupta in the SAnkara bhAshya could be as innocuous as that.It seems rather likely to me that oral instruction followed by later reduction to writing was how the bhAshyas originally came into being. Was Sankara bhagavatpAda busy teaching his disciples in the ancient method of oral transmission or did he sit down with stylus and tALapatra to write down things in his own handwriting? Perhaps a bit of both, like teachers anywhere in the world?



Best regards,

Vidyasankar
