The author points out that there is recorded evidence of a vassal of the Calukyas called balavarman, and postulates thatjayasiMha was aCalukya king while kRSNaguptacould be a reference to the Rashtrakuta king, Krishna I, who defeated the Calukyas and reversed the older king-feudatory relationship between the Calukyas and the Rashtrakutas.

From the above it is very clear that the Kengo Harimoto is very vague about the dates and is taking recourse to wild imagination. How does all he says fit into the proposed date of 788 CE of Adi Shankaracharya ?  

  

On the otherhand Adi Shankara's bhashya on the Brhmasutra mentions Purnavarmana or Hala, who reigned till 489 BCE. At that time (i.e., in 489 BCE) Adi Shankara was 20 years old and he composed the Brahmasutra by that time. This is quite compatible with the 509 BCE as the birth-year of Adi Shankara.
