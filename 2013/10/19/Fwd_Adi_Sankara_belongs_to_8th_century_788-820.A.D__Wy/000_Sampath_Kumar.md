Dear friends ..

No dispute on the date of Adi sankara.  

Adi sankara belongs to 8th century\[ 788-820.A.D\] only

i will show you the evidence, follow these lines.

Adi sankara quoted Sundra Pandya verses.

but he did not mentioned the auther of the verses.

Actually those verses written by Sundara pandya of 7th century king and Philosopher.He ruled the Pandya kingdom.

so we can assume Adi Sankara belongs to later to Sundarapndya.

kingdom.

See Adi Sankara's lines.

1-Adi sankara in his Bhashya \[ Sutra bhashya\]

there are 3 verses quoted in समन्वयाधिकरण भाष्ये; 1-1-4

as अपि चाहुः-

१-गौणमिथ्यात्मनोऽसत्वे पुत्रदेहादि बाधनात्

सद्ब्रह्मात्माहमित्येवं बोधे कार्यं कथं भवेत्॥

२-अन्वेष्टव्यात्मविज्ञानात् प्राक् प्रमातृत्वमात्मनः

अन्विष्टः स्यात् प्रमातैव पाप्मदोषादि वर्जितः॥

३-देहात्मप्रत्ययो यद्वत् प्रमाणत्वेन कल्पितः

लौकिकस्तद्वदेवेदं प्रमाणं त्वात्मनिश्चयात्॥

In the Commentary of Bhaamati these verses quoted as

एते ब्रह्मविदां गाथाः-

2-Amalaananda in his "kalpataru\[कल्पतरु\] commentery on bhaamati

mentioned another 3 verses निश्रेण्यारोहण प्राप्यं प्राप्तमात्रोपपादि च etc...as written by Sundara Pandya.

3-Madhava mantri in his तात्पर्य दीपिक व्याख्या on

"Suta samhita" he quoted 3rd verse and mentioned as ,

he taken these verses from वार्तिका of Sundara Pandya.

4-Kumarila in his तंत्र वार्तिक quoted 5 verses 3+2 as

*आह चात्र निदर्शनमाचार्य सुंदरपाड्यः।*

Other 2 verses are

४-तॆन यद्यपि सामर्थ्यं प्रत्येकंसिद्धिमन्यथा

तथापि युगपद्भावेजघन्यस्य निराक्रिया॥

५-अन्यथैव हि शून्यॆषु दुर्बलैरपि चर्यतॆ

अन्यथा बलवद्ग्रस्तैःसर्व शक्तिक्षये सति॥

5-In प्रबोध परिशोधनी a commentary on पञ्चपादिका of

Padmapaadacharya , written by AtmaSvarupa

he mentioned as these 3 verses are belongs to SundaraPandya.

6-In न्याय सुधा ,Jnaanottama mentioned these 5 verse as

वृद्ध वचनानि.

SundaraPandya is a philosopher king. Historians assumes

he wrote a commentary on BrahmaSutra also. but it was lost.

any how it is evident he wrote a Vartika which may be a commentery on Brahma sutra.

So Adi Sankara belongs to later period of Sundara Pandya

Good luck
