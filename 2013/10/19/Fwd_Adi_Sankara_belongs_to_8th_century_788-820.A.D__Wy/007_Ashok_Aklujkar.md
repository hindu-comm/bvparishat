On 2013-10-20, at 6:44 AM, Shri Ajit Gargeshwari made two points. I agree with the first, namely \>Thanks Sri Vidyasankar for pointing out this topic has quite extensively been discussed in Advaita-L mailing list and other online lists. Let us now tentatively put a stop to this topic unless scholars can share and bring out any new or latest research on this topic.\<

  

I also agree when he says: \>Let us stick to this basic guideline नामूलं लिख्यते किंचित् नानपेक्षितमुच्यते।\< Although originally written by Mallinaatha in the context of commentary writing, what the verse half conveys is a good principle for historical research, too.

  

What I am not sure about is the translation of the verse half: \>Nothing is written out of focus and whatever is written is not without any authentic source". Probably Shri Gargeshwari intends the second clause in the English sentence as a translation of the first clause in the Sanskrit sentence. If that is the case, "Nothing is written out of focus" would be a rather opaque or too free a translation of naanapek.sitam ucyate. 'Nothing unseen/unexpected is said" is what the clause should literally mean. Given the fact that Mallinaatha was making the statement in his introduction to a commentary about to follow, we may add "(by the author of the commentandum -- the text being commented upon)" after"unseen/unexpected." Following vartamaana-saamiipye vartamaanavat, we may also use "will be" in the place of "is". It would also be justifiable to extend the intended context beyond commentary writing and understand Mallinaatha as meaning "Nothing that is usually not intended by the words -- that goes beyond the normal, easily defensible or attested meanings of words -- will be said." A further extension to "Nothing unseen/unexpected in the context of the given culture/tradition" can also not be ruled out.

  

IfShri Gargeshwari wished to stick to the clause sequence of the original, the opacity of translation will be even greater.

  

I felt like making these comments (a) because Mallinaatha has made a highly beneficial programmatic statement, and it is important that we understand it correctly or at least within certain explicitly stated limits and (b) because I have not so far seen a translation of Mallinaatha's statement, although it recurs in the introductions of his commentaries. It is good thatShri Ajit Gargeshwari has offered a translation. If there are any other out there, I would be grateful to learn what they are.

P.S.

  

I would also like contributors not to reproduce the earlier posts in their entirety unless it is necessary to do so for taking the discussion ahead.
