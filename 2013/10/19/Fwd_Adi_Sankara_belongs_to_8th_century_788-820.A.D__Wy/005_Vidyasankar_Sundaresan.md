To add to Sri Ajit Gargeshwari's comment about the relevant scholarly literature, thistopic has also been discussed threadbare online in recent times and hardly deserves another protracted debate on this forum. Some of the most comprehensive internet discussions of this topic can be found by searching in the public archives of Advaita-L (<http://lists.advaita-vedanta.org/archives/advaita-l>) via Google. To find most of it in one place, as summarized by yours truly,please visit <http://www.advaita-vedanta.org/avhp> and follow the links to Sankara's life and the Sankaravijaya literature.



Bhattacharyaji, please do not thrust upon me the disagreeable task of refuting you time and again, on multiple online forums! I sincerely hope you pick up a copy of Swami Tapasyananda's translation of the Madhaviya Sankaravijaya and actually take the trouble to read his verbatim quotation of a letter from the Sringeri Peetha's adminstration from decades ago. Please note that this Swamiji belongsto the RamakrishnaMath,which operates quite independently of Sringeri andcannot be accused of being partisan in any way. I have pointed out all these things numerous times elsewhere and really have no wish to expand upon everything all over again. Somehow, the fact that the Sringeri Peetha has the best maintained historical records seems to irk some people no end. What a pity. Ihope that this thread doesn't degenerate into Sringeri vs. others, as happens all too often whenever this topic comes up. All I will say here is that scholars should note the force of G C Pande's comment in his book on Sankara's life, namely that only the Sringeri lineage fits best with what is known independently from other sources of historical data.



I can add one piece of recent scholarly research to this discussion. Kengo Harimoto,a Japanese scholar who studied in the USA andis currently based in Germany, presented a paper a few years ago, drawing attention to some other names mentioned in the brahmasUtra bhAshya and connecting them with known chieftains and kings in south India from around the 7th century CE. I will summarize its contents here when I find the citation, for the benefit of this Parishat.



Best regards,

Vidyasankar
