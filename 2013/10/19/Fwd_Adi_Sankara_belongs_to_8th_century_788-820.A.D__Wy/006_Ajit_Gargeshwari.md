Thanks Sri Vidyasankar for pointing out this topic has quite extensively been discussed in Advaita-L mailing list and other online lists. Let us now tentatively put a stop to this topic unless scholars can share and bring out any new or latest research on this topic. Let us stick to this basic guideline नामूलं लिख्यते किंचित् नानपेक्षितमुच्यते।"Nothing is written out of focus and whatever is written is not without any authentic source".
