Dear Vidyashankarji,  
  

Yoy do not seem to have noticed my emphasis on the date of Kanishka on the basis of Rajatarangini and recent astronomical studies. Kanishma was living in the 13th century BCE and that also shows that the pauranic date of Lord Buddha in the 19th century BCE is correct. Moreover
astronomical studies based on data from cannonical Buddhist literature as well as the reapprisal of the Dotted records also support that. All that also pushes back the date of Dharmakirti.  
  

Do you think that Dharmakirti's date around 6th century BCE has no impact on the date of date of Adi Shankaracharya ?  
  

My copy of Mr. Umeswh's book is in Mumbai and I shall try to get it back soon. As you have that book with you may also let me know if Mr. Umesh had mentioned about Dharmakirti in his book. I trust that Mr. Umesh had indeed become a recluse and what I meant was that my questions to him remained unanswered. So I am unable to consider his work as foolproof, though he might have done to the best of his knowledge. It is also quite possible that he (Mr. Umesh was not aware of the 19th century BCE date of Lord Buddha and its implications in the dating of Adi Shankaracharya.  
  

Regards,
