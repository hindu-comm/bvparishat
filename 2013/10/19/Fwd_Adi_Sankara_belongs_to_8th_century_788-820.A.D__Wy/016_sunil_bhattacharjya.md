Vidyasankarji,  
  

I have not yet read the paper by Kengo Harimoto as I did not succeed in getting a copy of that so far. However, as you report, if his study does not lead to any possible date of Adi Shankaracharya that work is at best like that of Nakamura in this respect ans is inconclusive. As regards the name of Hala being Purnavarman, the source is Vayu purana and I respect the Puranas as the fifth Veda. In my view the ancient sages were honest to the core and they did not take resort to falsehood. The Puranic Chronology also is reliable as I find from my study, particularly when the informations are not contested by any other purana.  
  

As regards the work of Shri Umesh I could get a copy of that about four years ago, through the courtesy of one of his junior associates in Chennai. I had some questions on that. I sent my questions to Mr. Umesh through the same associate of his but that associate replied saying that Mr. Umesh had become a sort of recluse and that I should not expect any response. Offhand I cannot reproduce those questions, now and here, but that incident definitely created a sort of scepticism about Mr. Umesh's scholarship and on the soundness of his reasoning. If you wish to look at those mails of correspondence I may try to retrieve those, though it may take a while for that.  
  

As regards the historicity or chronology it has its own value and a search for the historicity would not hamper the spiritual quest, in which the Shankara mathas are engaged. Moreover to my knowledge the
Holy Mathadhipatis leave the question of history to the historians, to sort out. If we are to believe the Narada purana, it indicates that a knowledge of the proper historicity is good for dharma. Offhand I do not have the Narada Purana reference for that but if you insist I can get that reference and report here.  
  

Further the recent work on the date of Lord Buddha confirms his Puranic date and the date of Dharmakirti also changes to the BCE period. Rajatarangini as well as the astronomical study of Prof. Narahari Achar also show that Kaniska was living in the beginning of the 13th century BCE. Kaniska lived after about five hundred years of passing away of Lord Buddha. Lord Buddha passed away towards the end of the 19th century BCE. Prof. M.A.Troyer was the lone western scholar to contestseverely
the chronology proposed by Prof. Max Muller. Prof. Max Muller proposed a date of Lord Buddha, which made him a contemporary of Lord Mahavira.
Prof. Max Muller also went for the 788 CE date of Adi Shankara as was proposed by Mr. Pathak, as that fell in line with his (Prof. Max Muller's) date of Lord Buddha. The wrong conclusions of Mr. Pathak and Prof. Max Muller had created havoc in the historicity of Adi Shankaracharya also. Mr. Umesh and others engaged in dating of Adi Shankara are completely unaware of the 19th century BCE date of Lord Buddha. Had they known that Lord Buddha lived in the 19th century BCE and Dharmakirti also had also lived around 6th century BCE, they could have been able to get an idea of the correct date of Adi Shankaracharya.
