Namaste



On the word \<anapeskhitam> to yield the translation \< "Nothing unseen/unexpected in the context of the given culture/tradition" can also not be ruled out. \>



Can we also understand the word as \< anapekshitam \> = \< na – apa – Ikshitam> = Not seen with skewed eyes, Not seen in a distorted perspective. \< Iksha darshane: Drushir -PrekshaNe>



The \< a-moolam> Is one criterion firming up the \< Base, anchor, Original Continuing Shista Tradition, Undistorted, un-mutilated, supported by evidence of acceptable and authorized kind, without any roots \>



The \< anapekshitam> can go beyond to the next level of \< demand for clear vision without any flavors, fuzziness, coloration , motives, imposed limitation, forced interpretations, coming with an analytically clear understanding, personal constructions of preference> . It is not all \< blind compulsive conformity to a ‘ sheep follow sheep’ - \> view repetition ?



The ‘practical criticism’ methodology that I A Richards proposed gives a similar thought. The ‘ moola vakyArtha vichAra’ followed in traditional pedagogy is another endorsement for this approach. What the text says / capable of saying is the key; What I understand is secondary and contextual. In this sense, Mallinath keeping the focus on padartha –alamkara as main and dhvani to a limited extend makes sense in the commentaries. It is also a key differentiator from Mallinathas commentary and modern \< pravachanas> elaborating the contextual \<dhnvani meanings>.
