Namaste,  
  

I also support Ajitji's quoting : नामूलं लिख्यते किंचित् नानपेक्षितमुच्यते. One should not write baseless things, which in our parlance means that if questioned the writer has to be able to substantiate what he writes with explanations and proper references. One should also not speak (or state in writing) what is not called for, as otherwise the discussions will include irrelevant issues and the focus will be lost.
