Dear Sri Bhattacharya,



I'm afraid we are starting to go over the very same ground that we have already covered earlier elsewhere, so I'll try and address only the new points raised by the paper I cited. Hopefully, it will also be my last response on this topic on BVP, at least for now.



1\. Contrary to howyou portray it, Kengo Harimoto does indicate a date for Sankara within a16 year period in the latter half of the 8th century, as dictated by the known and documented history of the Calukya and Rashtrakuta dynasties. I had already mentioned that this is as narrow as one can achieve, in my synopsis of his paper. It is a about a specific quotation in the brahmasUtrabhAshya and if this hypothesis is correct, I have also explained why the proposed period can be more conclusive than any assertion of a morecertain date. Rather than trying to dismiss Harimoto's hypothesis with a host of other unrelated details, it would behove you to examine the balavarman, jayasimha, kRshNagupta relationship in the BSBh. If youcan offer an alternative hypothesis or at least disprove Kengo's hypothesis about the Calukyas and Rashtrakutas without offering a different explanation of the BSBh citation, then a discussion can progress. If this cannot be done by anyone who doesn't like an 8th century CE date for Sankara, then Kengo Harimoto'sexplanation of the BSBh citation remains as a plausible reconstruction of Sankara's historical circumstances. In fact, it is the most plausible one that I have seen so far on this subject.



2\. Frankly, it amazes me that one would want to say that Sankara wasexactly so manyyears old on such and such a date when he wrote such and such a bhAshya.One can of course say these kinds of things in some kind of traditional poetic praSaMsA, butthat would not be historyaccording tothe standards of contemporary scholarship. I have already explained how and where justifiable uncertainties about dates arise. Again, I would urge you, keep an open mind till you get a chance to read the paper in full and please keep an open mind afterwards as well, in order to deliberate on it as dispassionately as possible.



3\. Please do not cast aspersions on Sri Umesh's scholarship or soundness of reasoning. Take it from me as well, that he is indeed quite a recluse and that he is just not interested in continuing with mundane discussions like the one we are having right now. He has been there, done that, as they say nowadays. He is a "viviktadeSasevI, arato janasaMsadi, and tulyanindAstutir maunI santushTo yena kenacit." These are qualities that we advaitins must respect, not criticize lightly. If you are interested in discussing details of the bhAshya-s from a philosophical standpoint or exchange notes onyoga sAdhana with him, through the same student of his, thenyou may have better luck conversing with him.



4\. This may be a contentious point, but please note that not all maThAdhipatis in recent times have left history to the historians. And unfortunately, Adhipatyam of a maTha is also not a guarantor of holiness. Probably everybody on this list knows it and acknowledges it, but it falls to me to say it out loud and I am invariably seen as criticizing people who should never be criticized. Ironically, in the one case where the maThAdhipati-s have indeed left carcA about historical dates to the historians, you and others want to criticize them and you unfairly assert that the maTha has changed its paramparA list over time. Whereas, you know fully well that all they have done is to reassign the dates given to some of the early names in their traditonally reported paramparA. Please read Swami Tapasyananda's quotation in his translation of the Madhaviya Sankaravijaya, to get a correct picture of the situation.



5\. Most of the rest of the details below can very quickly be assigned to the anapekshita category when it comes to Sankara's date, after just a little bit of deliberation. For example,nobody is saying that the vAyupurANa is wrong in its hala = pUrNavarman equation. However, on what basis can one equate the pUrNavarman mentionedin passing inthe BSBh with the one mentioned in the vAyupurANa?Sankara is, after all, not the author of vAyupurANa. Resorting to the fifth veda status of the purANa texts does not help the case. Many independent scholars who must have known of the vAyupurANa insteadthought that the pUrNavarman of BSBh could have been some other king,from distant Cambodia, based on an inscription found there.In reality, both identifications of this pUrNavarman in BSBh could be quite far-fetched and inappropriate. So today, we have an Amar Chitra Kathamyth about Sankara and Cambodia, a far-fetched tale that is not found in any of the Sankaravijaya texts. Similarly with the date of the Buddha.What is therule that fixes the time elapsed between the parinibbana of the Buddha and the janma of Sankara? Who made up that rule? The buddha's datecould be50th century BCE or 20th century BCE or 5th century BCE or even in the distantfuture (maitreya), but this does notmaterially affect an independent assessment of Sankara's date based on internal evidence from Sankara's own works. Sotalking ofgautama siddhArtha, the buddha known to history,and imposing a newhistorical reconstruction upon his date, are ultimately irrelevant fordetermining Sankara's date.



I could go on, but nothing I couldpossiblysay on any of these points would be unfamiliar to you, so I will stop here.



Best regards,

Vidyasankar
