Adi Shankara's date has been discussed for more than 140 years or more in various Indological Journals and books. Hajime Nakamura in his History of Early Vedanta Volume 1 has exhaustively discussed all major research papers on Adi Shankaras date. ( The book might available on <http://www.scribd.com>). If members have published any further research on this area of research please post. There is no point in stating known postions of other scholars which is well known to scholars of this group. We should not end up quoting each other if we have nothing substantial to add on this topic. Thanks.
