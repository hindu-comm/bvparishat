Dear friends,  
  
There was no Sundara pandy in the 6th century also. The Pandyan kings ruled arond the times of Adi Sankaracharya in the 6th century BCE. According to the Mahavamsha the Lankan king had matrimonial relationship with the Pandya kings and that was in the 6th century BCE.  
  

Moreover the Dwaraka peeth and the Puri peeth has the Guru-parampara lists going back upto 2,500 years ago. The Shringeri peeth, on the other hand, in fact, gave out different guru paramapra lists at different times, which conflict with each other. At one time the guru-parampara was shown as starting from 44 BCE and later on as starting from the 8th century.

Thus there is no doubt that Adi Shankara lived in the 6th century BCE and that is proven by the fact that the guru-parampara lists of the two Shankara peeths have vouched for it. Historically too there are evidences that Dharmakirti, a senior contemporary of Adi Shankaracharya, lived around 6th century BCE and this is in line with the date of Lord Buddha, who lived in the 19th century BCE The evidences for lthe 19th century date of Lord Buddha comes from the Rajatarangini as well as Dr. Narahari Achar's astronomical dating of Lord Buddha in the 19th century BCE and my own research on the Dotted Records, a paper on which was presented in the WAVES conference a few years ago.

THus there is not an iota of doubt that Adi Shankara was born in the 6th century BCE

Regards,

Sunil KB
