Thanks for the etymology and its correct translation. Here are the different meanings of the verb, with उपसर्ग - अप and one can take any meaning depending on the context:

  

 ಅಪೇಕ್ಷ್

  

(H1) ಅಪೇ\* ಕ್ಷ್ \[p= 56,2\] \[L=10364\]

( √ಈಕ್ಷ್) to look away , to look round AV. S3Br. ;

  

to have some design ;

  

to have regard to , to respect ;

  

to look for , wait for ;

  

to expect , hope ;

  

to require , have an eye to Sa1h. ;

  

*withन, not to like Katha1s.*

  

and take around the meaning, what is generally taken for the verb: अपेक्षते as in the in the usage and distort the meaning in every context as in the usages than that is needed by the context:

  

अपेक्षा, अपेक्षितम्।  

  

सा विवक्षामपेक्षते -

  

(H2) अपे\* क्षा \[p= 56,3\] \[L=10370\] f. looking round or about , consideration of , reference , regard to (in comp. ; rarely loc.)

\[p= 56,3\] \[L=10371\] dependence on , connection of cause with effect or of individual with species

\[p= 56,3\] \[L=10372\] looking for , expectation , hope , need , requirement

(H2C) अपे\* क्षया \[p= 56,3\] \[L=10373\] ind. with regard to (in comp.)

\[p= 56,3\] \[L=10377\] looked for , expected

\[p= 25,3\] \[L=5132\] unheeded
