Thanks for the comments on the translation of Mallinatha's statement and its applicabilityto all the writings in the modern context in the name of research or new findings.

  

Indeed, it is a free translation of the half verse and strictly applicable strictly to the context of commentary as explained in the first half:

  

इहान्वयमुखेनैव सर्वं व्याख्यायते मया।

नामूलं लिख्यते किंचित् नानपेक्षितमुच्यते॥  

  

Both the clauses are eligible for wider interpretation than the context of commentary in general and I liked it in the extended sense.

  

The word अमूलं can be interpreted in different ways because of the compound, hardly not as that is not in the मूल. But only, as नञ् compound, either Tatpurusha or Bahuvrihi,

  

न मूलम् = अमूलम्, not मूल. strictly not the origin (source). naturally we take by मूल for the the text commented.

  

अविद्यमानं मूलं यस्य - अमूलम्, किंचित् न लिख्यते is the बहुव्रीहि compound, as per used as adverb or adjective, अमूलं न किंचित् लिख्यते and"नञोऽस्त्यर्थानां बहुव्रीहिरुत्तरपदलोपश्च" (वा।१०२) इति विद्यमानशब्दलोपः\| which gives the intended meaning that nothing is written without source and hardly that is not in the मूल. And also he has already stated, he is strictly following the अन्वय for everything in the text - इहान्वयमुखेनैव सर्वं व्याख्यायते by sarva, everything in the text he is commenting is naturally one can grasp. I found both the meanings in a dictionary online:

  

अमूल a.

1 Rootless (lit.); पशवो$मूला ओषधयो$ मूलिन्यः Śat. Br.; (fig.); without basis or support, baseless, groundless.

*-2 without authority; not being in the original; इहान्वयमुखेनैव सर्वं व्याख्यायते मया । नामूलं लिख्यते किंचित् Malli. Introduction of Ṭīkā on R.*

  

If we apply his principle to his own commentary, whenever he gives further explanations, meanings not popular, he quotes lexicons for meanings not popular or नानार्थ, to make clear the meaning and grammatical explanations in the case rare forms. And not given for common words or common forms popular. This might have been intended by the phrase "नानपेक्षितमुच्यते।" as for common words need not any detailed quotations lexicons, grammar or other sources to support them and only in the cases where they are required, he explains with sources quoted in support of his interpretation. This what I liked and explained as nothing is written out of focus and whatever is needed, is not written without authorities quoted.

  

This is desirable in the discussions or comments in a group of scholars, like BVP can accept this maxim in its extended sense as a general standard though this is not necessarily to be followed in any other blog spots on the web. Only that much is intended by Mr.Ajith.

  

And a similar statement is also found in Kiratarjuniya, of Bharavi, who is popular for his presentation of the ideas: "भारवेरर्थगौरवम्" ---

  

स्फुटता न पदैरपाकृता न च न स्वीकृतमर्थगौरवम्।

रचिता पृथगर्थता गिरां न च सामर्थ्यमपोहितं क्वचित्॥ (किरातार्जुनीये महाकाव्ये २---२७)

  

I am not giving the translation, as it itself clearly states the necessity of clarity and leave the अर्थगौरव to be understood by the members while writing the messages.
