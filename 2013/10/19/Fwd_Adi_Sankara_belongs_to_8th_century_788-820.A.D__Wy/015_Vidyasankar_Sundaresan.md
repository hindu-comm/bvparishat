Bhattacharyaji, it is not wild imagination. It is just sound scholarship. Please read the paper in detail if you get a chance. I only presented a small synopsis ofits major conclusion.The author is not a proponent of the 788 CE date for Sankara, but clearly, he does not accept the 5th cent BCE date either. Nothing wrong with any of this. In fact, there is everything that is right with it, because of its intellecual honesty. He has adequately addressed the name pUrNavarman quoted in BSBh as well. Note that BSBh does not use the name hala. The equation of pUrNavarman with hala comes from sources outside Sankara himself. Please ask yourself, does the BSBh citation indicate that its author and this pUrNavarman were contemporaries? Assuming that pUrNavarman was an actual historical person, all one can say is that Sankara bhagavatpAda must have lived later than pUrNavarman, butwe cannot knowwhether it was a day later or a year later or a century later or a millennium later.



As you may be aware, another author, R M Umesh, a close disciple of the previous Sringeri Sankaracharya, has also written about Sankara's date, where he examines all these questions (but not the balavarman, jayasiMha and kRSNagupta citation, to my knowledge). Healso leaves it as some time in the 7th-8th century. His SraddhA and bhakti towards his chosen guru did not blind him to the just parameters of scholarly research. And Dr. Kunjunni Raja of The Adyar Library, a firm proponent of the 788 CE date,wrote a foreword to Umesh's book, commending it. This kind of open-endedness that scholarship often demands may be disconcerting for those who want absolutely certainty, but in reality, it is the quest for historical certainty that is faulty. Sometimes, so long as a general picture emerges that is internally consistent, that is the best one can do. In many cases, "iti syAt" is better than "ity eva."



I hope you don't take this personally, but could you tell me the exact samvatsara, mAsaand nakshatraunder which each one of your grandfathers' grandfathers were born?Orthe mAsa, paksha and tithiof their deaths? I don't know thebirthdates even for my own grandfathers, leave alone all these details abouttheir grandfathers. The conclusion is, unless these people left some enduring record of their day to day lives, we know very little indeed, even from say two hundred years ago. In India, we may know some of these details for three generations before us, because of the traditions of doing SrAddha for ancestors and ArAdhana for saMnyAsi gurus, but we don't necessarily keep records of these details going back formany hundreds orthousands ofyears. Therefore, thefurther back in the past you try to go, the less definite you can be about dates. Where you have pratyaksha evidence, e.g. a verse providing some detail, an inscription recording a grant, etc.,you can be happy with certainty. Where you have to rely on anumAna or arthApatti or Uha or aitihya, i.einfer/ hypothesize/ assume/ correlate, absolute certainty is impossible. A better argument that dislodges a previously held conclusion needs to be given importance and accepted if it stands scrutiny.



Best regards,

Vidyasankar



ps. Also, please take into consideration that for religious and philosophical traditions like ours, which do not pin their worth on historical events in the lives of prophets orsaviors, a quest for certainty about thehistories of their torchbearers is at best an unnecessary digression. It can even be a harmful preoccupation.
