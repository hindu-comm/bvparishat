This is just to add another instance of the use of the word: In Carnatic music there is this name of a rAga: punnAgavarALi.  
  

Also, is this:

  
  
Kannada Name: Surahonne  
Tamil Name: Punnai, Pinnay  
Telugu : Ponna, Suraponna  
  

in any way related to a very strong smelling plant called in Kannada as 'nAgadALi' which is common even in city gardens? In olden days they would say that the strong scent of the plant would attract snakes.
