Dear Sri Subrahmanian Ji  
In your mail it was mentioned with a question mark in the following manner:

  
" in any way related to a very strong smelling plant called in Kannada as 'nAgadALi' which is common even in city gardens?"  

Is this your question or is it an added information? Please help me in understanding.  

With warm regards,  

**Dr. Rani Sadasiva Murty**
