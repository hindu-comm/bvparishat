Respected Scholars

 I have a Sanskrit manuscript in Granth Script which is available up to 40 pages. I need scholarsâ€™ help to translate it into Devanagari Script. It is a part of my Ph.D. work.

Scholars are requested to help in it. I can send digital copy of the manuscript or If possible personally I can come to the scholars.
