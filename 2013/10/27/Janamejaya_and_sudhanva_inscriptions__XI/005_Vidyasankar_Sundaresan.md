Dear Bhattacharyaji,



I think one should not invest maTha-s with personalities capable of lying orspeaking the truth. They are not individual people, but a collection of people, each with their own agendas, virtues and failings.



We should also remember that a maTha is not just a forest dwelling of a saMnyAsin. They have become institutions with recorded histories, finances, debts, land ownership andtenants, administrations, administrators andemployees, lay followers, champions and detractors. This situation generates its fair share of problems and a saMnyAsin maThAdhipati often has little say over these matters. Indeed, if a saMnyAsin wants to maintainhis personal focus on saMnyAsa and sAdhana, he has to remain padmapatram ivAmbhasA, ensuring that he does not get entangled in the saMsAra caused by the maTha. Some maThAdhipati-s succeed, some fail, others have mixed records. All of this is par for the course.



Therefore, we need to develop an element of viveka here - an ability to separate fiction from fact andto separate reasonable self-accounts from far-fetched claims. We can accuse our past British colonial rulers of many faults indeed, but let us accuse them for the right reasons. We would do a disservice to ourselves if we start tilting at the windmills of Aryan Invasion/Migration theories and tie those in to the date of Adi Sankara, Mahavira and Buddha. The actual dates, histories and legendsassociated with these religious leaders had really very little to do with the search for a proto-Indo-European homeland or the dates of invasions/migrations into or out of the India.



Finally, speaking as a south Indian,I think those of us interested in history should also get rid of the fixation withthe vikramAditya who ruled from Ujjain. There are plenty of vikrama-s, Aditya-s and vikramAditya-s to choose from in the Chola, Pandya, Calukya and Rashtrakuta dynasties. And from the time of gautamIputra SAtakarNI of the Satavahanadynasty,south India has largely chosen to record its significant events in SakAbda, not as per the vikrama samvat. The vikrama mentioned as the king in whose 14th year Sankara was born could have well been a vikrama from the Calukya dynasty, which ruled for many centuries over the land that comprised most of today's Maharashtra, Andhra and Karnataka.



Best regards,

Vidyasankar
