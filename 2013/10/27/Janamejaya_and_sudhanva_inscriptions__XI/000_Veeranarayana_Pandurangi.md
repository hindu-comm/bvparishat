2\. one insription of sudhanva is said to be found in Dvaraka Shankara math is mentioned in the below link

  

<http://mahabharathascience.blogspot.in/p/material-evidence-supporting-time-of.html>

  

"the copper plate inscription of Emperor Sudhanva who ruled over Gujarat. It was a memorandum presented by Emperor Sudhanva to Sri Sankara was inscribed on copper-plate dated the year 2663 on the Yudhishtira Saka. The copper plate inscription of Emperor Sudhanva proves that the year of the demise of Sri Sankara is 2663 of the Yudhishtira Era or B.C. 477-76. The beginning of Yudhishtira Era is the time of the Mahabharata war. It had already proved to be B.C. 3138. So Sri Sankara’s life works out to be B.C. 509 to B.C.477-476, Yudhishtira Era 2662+476=3138 B.C."

  

full version of this inscription is found in the below link

needs to be verified.

  

below link quotes it to be available in Dvaraka peeth.

<http://vanitha.manoramaonline.com/cgi-bin/MMOnline.dll/portal/ep/home.do?thisPage=%2Fep%2Ftheweek%2Fcontent%2FprintArticle.jsp%3FBV_ID%3D%2540%2540%2540%26com.broadvision.session.new%3DYes%26articleTitle%3DFirst%2Bof%2Bthe%2Bmutts%26language%3Denglish%26contentOID%3D10650715>  

  

"Mahamahopadhyay J.N. Dwivedi, director of Dwarakadheesh Sanskrit Academy and Indology Research Institute, tells us that the current Shankaracharya of Dwaraka is 78th since the time of Adi Shankara. “There has not been a single day when Dwaraka Peetha did not have a Shankaracharya,” he says. “There is an interesting copper plate inscription at the peetha which was issued by King Sudhanva in 477 BC.” (The peetha puts Adi Shankara’s birth at around 507 BC.) There are no other records available."  

  

please help me to get it verified.
