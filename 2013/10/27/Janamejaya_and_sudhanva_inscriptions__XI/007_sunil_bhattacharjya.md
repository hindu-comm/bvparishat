Dear Vidyashankarji,  
  

I have not invested maTha-s with personalities capable of lying orspeaking the truth. In company law a company may have many people but it is considered to be a person. I extended that sort of representation to the Matha. If you do not approve of it it is okay. I shall not say the shringeri matha had not lied. I will restate that as follows. One of the Mathadhipatis disclosed the fact as per the Matha records Adi Shankaracharya was born on the 15th year of the reign of Vikramaditya and that has not been contested so far. As the fact, that Adi Shankaracharya was born on the 15th year of the reign of Vikramaditya, emanated from no other source other than the Shringeri Math itself, it is incumbent on the Matha to find out that particular Vikramaditya.  

  
Your said that "the Vikrama mentioned as the king in whose 14th year Sankara was born could have well been a vikrama from the Calukya dynasty". It appears to me that all such attempts must have failed, as till date no scholar could produce any valid information so far to relate the 788 CE date for Adi Shankaracharya with any of the
Vikramadityas of the Chalukya dynasty. Quite sometime ago I also looked at this aspect but I could not find a single Vikramadiutrya of the Chalukya dunasty to fit the bill. I am very sure there is no such Vikramaditya of the Chalukya dynasty to support the 788 BCE date. May be you would like to give it try yourself.  
  

It will be nice if you can tell us since which date the Shringeri math had accepted (I mean publicly proclaimed) the 788 CE as the birth year of Adi Shankaracharya.  

  

Regards,
