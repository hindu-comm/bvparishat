Let me begin with a caveat. Contrary to appearances, I am not an official spokesperson for the Sringeri Matha. Here,I am only sharing my own conclusions, after having conducted my own study of the advaita vedAnta texts and traditions. If you are interested in an official statement, please write a letter to Sri V R Gowrishankar, the current chief administrator of the Sringeri Peetham. The Matha authorities continue to be very old-fashioned about these matters and letters, written with the proper, traditional respect and decorum in their content and tone,have a better chance of getting a response than emails and mailing list or blog discussions.



Also,pleasenote that the old Sringeri record does NOT say vikramAditya. It only says vikrama. The difference in name may or may not be significant, but I note it here, as elsewhere for the sake of the record. A similar statement, that Sankara was born in the 14th (not 15th, as far as I know) year of a king named vikrama, is also found in a Tamil text called kongudeSa rAjAkkaL (an account of the kings who ruled over kongudeSa, i.e. modern Coimbatore and its neighbourhood).



I think thatyou have a diametrically opposite view from the Sringeri Mathadhipatis/administrators in recent times with respect to what level of historical detail about this vikrama is incumbent upon them to find out. Prior to around the year 1800, none of the advaita sampradAya maThas in India really bothered about such details. It was the colonial contextand a peculiarly non-Indian preoccupation with historical dates of religious leaders that created this problem in the first place. For that matter, prior to the early 1900s, there was really no tradition of observing Sankara Jayanti every year. This tradition was started by the then Sringeri Sankaracharya andall the other institutions of advaita vedAnta have followed suit since then. And the way this Sankaracharya fixed the date for Sankara Jayanti was based not upon shaky and mutually contradictory astrological details found in various texts (or claimed to be found in one or the other dubious text), but bysimply applying the kaTapayAdi saMkhyA to the name Sankara, resulting inthe vaiSAkha month (ra = 2), Sukla paksha (ka = 1), pancamI tithi (Sa = 5).



In my very first response to you on thistopic, Ihad pointed you to Swami Tapasyananda's preface to the translation of the mAdhavIya Sankaravijaya. The letter quoted there specifically states that the Sringeri authorities have disclosed their record and left thejob of interpretation and identification to historians. This was something that you seemed to approve of, a few posts ago. Part of leaving a job of historical research to historians also means that there needs to be a willingness to engage with the conclusionsof such research in arational and logical manner anda willingness to accept them where appropriate.At one point of time, more than a hundred years ago, some thought it referred to the vikramAditya of the vikrama samvat, and so some of the old maTha publicationsmentionthe 1st cent BCEdate. This then resulted in an improbable period of 700+ years being assinged to sureSvarAcArya. Close to the beginning of the 20th century, others pointed out that the vikrama of this record could have been a southern king, whileother evidence came to light with respectto the 788 CE date, such as the manuscript quoted by Pathak in his Indian Antiquary article, the Kerala tradition relating Sankara with the origin of the Kollam era, etc.Note thatthe identification of the vikrama in whose time Sankara was supposedly born with a Chalukyan king named Vikramaditya wasa proposal by independent researchers. Tthe earliest to make this identification, to my knowledge, was B. Lewis Rice, compiler of Epigraphia Carnatica, an archaeologist and epigraphist in the then Mysore state. So the Sringeri administration gave up the 1st century BCE date and adopted the 8th century CE date, simply because this resulted in a more realistic time period that could be assigned to sureSvara and later successors in the lineage. That is about the gist of it.



At the time all this happened, the Sringeri Sankaracharya was Swami Chandrasekhara Bharati, a maThAdhipati who often remained antarmukha and who was least interested in any of this kind of activity. And you have no doubtvisited the links to what Swami Abhinava Vidyatirtha, his successor,said about the matter in the year 1988 when the 1200th birth anniversary of Sankara was observed all over India under government patronage. These wereprovided by Sri V. Subrahmanian on the Advaita list earlier, but here is the top link again,<http://adbhutam.wordpress.com/2009/08/09/greatness-of-shankaras-life-and-teachings-1/>. Please note what this Sringeri Sankaracharya frankly said, right in the opening paragraph, "Historically, 1200-1300 years have passed since Bhagavatpada was born. ... the mere reason that 788 A.D. may actually not be the year of Bhagavatpada’s advent cannot debar or render censurable the current twelfth birth centenary celebrations." He was open to the idea that 788 CE may not be the exact year, but the 5th century BCE date was certainly not admitted as a possibility. This is as official as it can get from Sringeri, but if you choose to think of this acceptance of a certain fuzziness in historical conclusions while going with the generally accepted 788 CE dateas a form of lying, that is your call.



Please also note that the Sringeri authorities have NOT changed their paramparA list at any point of time, except to realign the probable time periods to fit with indpendent evidencefrom other sources of history.They have been the only ones to admit that their solid, documented evidence dates fromaround the 14th century CE when the Vijayanagara empire was born and thateverything in between Sankara and Vidyaranya is subject to the fine tuning of historical research and its conclusions.They have been the only ones not to pretend that they have records of details of every event in the lives of every single person in the reported paramparA. For about a hundred years now, what they have got in return for this intellectual honesty and an openness towards objective and independent research is a lot of flak from many different quarters, including leaders and followers of those institutions thathave taken the opposite attitude towards history and Sankara's birth year. Yet, over the last century, whenever those institutions have needed to fix problems in their own backyards, their leaders haveinvariably turned to Sringeri for guidance. Such is the irony of the situation today.



Finally, let me reiterate that the Sringeri administration today reproduces the 788 CE date for Sankara, notbecause that was the 14th year of a king named vikrama who has been successfully identified, but because of other sources of evidence that pointed to this date. I won't go into detail here, but will leave it with a general statement that the evidence in support of 788 CE was sufficient to convince independentscholars like Dr. Kunjunni Raja, who had absolutely no stakes in supporting one maTha over another. Personally speaking, I think one can leave the issue as some time in the late 8th century CE, without having to get more specific, but I also think that the article by Kengo Harimoto that I cited could help narrow this window of about acentury down to a 16 year period between 756 and 772 CE.



If you are still very keen to find out a specific Vikramaditya in the Chalukya dynasty and assign a date, you have many to choose from. There wereVikramaditya I (655-680) andVikramaditya II (733-746)in the first dynasty, which lost power to the Rashtrakutas in the year 756. And there were Vikramaditya V (1008-1015) andVikramaditya VI (1076-1126) in the second dynasty, which came back to power around 973 CE. These 11th century dates are certainly too late to be considered seriously for Sankara bhagavatpAda, but note thatthe last one was the hero of Bilhana's Vikramankadevacarita and was responsible for a Chalukya Vikrama era. We don't really know who were the Vikramaditya-s numbered III and IV in that family, but they certainly had to have livedin a two century timeframeafter the year756 CE.
