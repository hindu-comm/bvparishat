The accusing finger can go to the British authorities, who had every reason to gain by hiding the copper grant, for the reason I mentioned in my last mail. In fact there is every reason to agree that the Dwarka Matha authorities were persuaded to part with the copper inscritption, in favour of safe-keeping by the archaeological authorities of the day. ... one thing is sure that the Linguists have never been known to say emphatic yes to anything.\<  
  
Will you please explain how you arrived at the certainty of all these conclusions?  
  
And, \*after you have done the above (take your time),\* will you please clarify (a) why history writing should proceed on the basis of some modern person's certainty instead of some objective or relatively objective evidence going near the relevant time, (b) why imputation of a motive should take the place of evidence, (c) why there should be no need to prove the motive itself on the basis of some objective or relatively objective evidence going near the relevant time, and (d) how you reconcile your statements in this thread with your statement "Not all that comes in the name of Shankaracharya are by Adi Shankaracharya" (with which I agree) under the Kundalini thread -- what makes you certain in one thread and not certain in the other?  
  
a.a.
