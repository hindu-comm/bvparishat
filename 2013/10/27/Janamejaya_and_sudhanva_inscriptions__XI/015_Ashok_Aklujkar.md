Honouring the moderator's wish, I am not going to continue this thread. However, I need to bring clarification to the posts I have already made on the topic specified above:

  

On 2013-10-30, at 9:00 PM, sunil bhattacharjya wrote:>It seems you are new to the controversy about the date of Adi Shankaracharya\<

  

No, I am not. I have known the controversy for at least thirty years and read about it whenever I could. Although in several areas of ancient Indian history I am in favour of taking the dates back in time, the date of Aadi ;Sa:nkaraacaarya is not one of them. In properhistorical research, definite documentary evidence (true copies will do in certain cases) and objective evidence (arising in a manner close to literal and contextually justifiable meanings of words found in relevant texts) should carry greater weight. 'Who of modern personalities said what' should not matter much.I was expecting you to go back to primary evidence, which you unfortunately did not or could not. Even in referring to your own conclusions, you did not reproduce. the relevant parts of your writings or direct me to the precise locations of the relevant writings (By this I do not mean earlier reiterations of what you said in the thread on this forum. I mean only the parts in which an argumentation \*based on definite documentation interpreted or analysed rigorously\* is offered). Shri Gargeshwari has already spoken of this.

  

On the contrary, you wrote:> if you want all the details from me you can have it, if and when I write a detailed paper or a book on it.\<I can understand waiting for a few details, but if none of the crucial details about which I asked are not with you, why did you participate in the discussion at this time and on what real basis did you assert what you did?

  

You have also given evidence of misunderstanding me. For example, you remarked:> if you think that the Dwarka math could be lying and the British authorities are above board, then you don't need to go into this topic at all.\<

  

Where did I say that "the Dwarka math could be lying and the British authorities are above board,"? In fact, my point has been that we do not impute motives \*as far as possible\* and, when we have to impute them, we must have at least some \*directly applicable\* documentary proof. We should leave room for the possibilities (a) na hi sarva.h sarva.m jaanaati -- even otherwise learned people can commit errors, especially in some areas and disciplines with which they are not familiar -- and (b) there can be genuinely honest mistakes or formations of wrong judgements. Shri Vidyasankar Sundaresan has already brought the scope for such possibilities to your attention.

  

Lastly, you wrote:>You are a well known Sanskrit scholar, yet it appears to me that you are unable to accept that chronologically the classical Sanskrit was later than the Buddhist hybrid Sanskrit. Historical studies have shown that Panini was living at a later period than Ashvaghosha. Seeing the unwelcome changes in the Sanskrit starting from the Vedic Sanskrit, the great stalwart Panini very well could have got motivated to take up the cudgel to write his Ashtadhyayi.\<

  

It is not a 'yet' case. It is a 'because' case. Precisely because I know a thing or two about Sanskrit and the proper methodologies for the relevant fields, I,likeShri Gargeshwari,cannot accept any of your conclusions listed here. (To say this is not to say that historians should not consider different possibilities or that one should not disagree with the conclusions of predecessors in the field. What I am saying is that one should not do so unless one really has good, precise evidence.)

  

If I remain silent on any expansion of the above-mentioned issues that you may make on this forum, pl do not attribute anything to me that my words above do not convey.

  

1. In my last post, the following typos need to be corrected (the correction is shown in brackets or rectangular parentheses):

(a) In such matters, a historian much \[--> must\] study the wording closely.

  

(b)The question, 'Is there anything in Kaalidaasa's personality that would make him \[imitate\] a Buddhist author?' needs to be asked.

  

(c)Some do occasionally commit the error of setting aside an Itihaasa or Puraa.na statement simply because it does not agree with the conclusion of modern historian\[s\].
