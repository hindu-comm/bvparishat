Dear Vidyashankarji,  
  

Yes I have great respect for the Shringeri mathadhipati, Unfortunately I had not been able to have his darshan soi far. Once I had been to Shringeri in 1989 or so but Swamiji was away from Shringeriat that time. .I also had been to Kudali Shringeri and the mathadhipati there was very kind to give an audience.,  

  
The old Sringeri record, to my knowledge, says that it was in the 14th year of the reign of **Vikramarka** that (Adi) Shankaracharya was born.  
  

Offhand I cannot tell you the name of the particular mathadhipati but what I remember reading is that in the beginning of the twentieth century one Mathadhipati of Shringeri opened the special box, where the matha records are in the custody of the Mathadhipati. and that he passed on the details that (Adi) Shankaracharya was born on the 14th year of Vikramarka..  
  
You may be aware that Dr. Hutzch also could find some record of Shankara-mathas in Karnataka going back to the 6th century BCE.. Are you sure that there is no chance of the old record of the Shringeri math being destroyed by the Muslim invaders particularly when Malik Kafur.even said to have managed to break the idol of Saradamnma there?  
  

Finally it is good to hear that the Shringeri authorities finally disowned the fact that Adi Shankaracharya was born oj the 14th year of the reign of Vikramarka.  
  

Regards,
