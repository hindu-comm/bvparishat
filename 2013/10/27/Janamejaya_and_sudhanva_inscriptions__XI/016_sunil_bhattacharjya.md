Dear Ajit Gargeshwaiji,  
  

I am happy that you have asked a few basic questions. At the outset I wish to make it known to you and the other friends that I am just giving my views and my line of reasoning and I also find that all your questions fall in line. However you are free to reject my reasoning if you consider that unacceptable to you and there should not be any quarrel on that.  

  

From Pauranic data I found that Lord Buddha lived in the 19th century BCE. Dr. Narahari Achar's astronomical dating supports that. My work on the Dotted Records also favours that. A paper on that was presented to WAVES conference in 2008. Buddhists accept that Lord Buddha taught in the language of the people at his time and Pali was the language and there are canonical Buddhist literature in that language. Lord Buddha gave more than one promulgation. In his second promulgation in the Vulture-peak, he taught the Mahayana principles and he had Brahmin disciples who recorded those in the Sanskrit and that is the starting time of the use Buddhist-Hybrid Sanskrit. Buddhists accept that Lord Buddha's Mahayana teaching were not disclosed immediately and it was only 500 years after Lord Buddha's demise those were disclosed by Nagarjuna. Buddhists also Nagarjuna and Ashvaghosha were contemporary of Kanishka. Kanishka lived in the 13th century BCE. From Rajatarangini we find that Gonanada III was ruling Kashmir from 1919 of Kali Era, which is 1182 BCE.Prior to Gonanda III Kashmir was ruled by Abhimanyu and prior to Abhimanyu the rulers were Hushka, Jushka and Kanishka. Dr. Narahari Achar's astronomical dating of Kanishka in the 13th century BCE is quite in order, though it challenges the view of the present day historians.  
  

Now coming to Panini I never challenged the date pf Panini. No Scholar gave the date of Panini before the 19th century BCE date of Lord Buddha. As Panini lived after Lord Buddha, he indeed saw the Sanskrit as used in those days and he was indeed oppressed by the state of the Sanskrit language in his time. The highest antiquity given to Panini by the scholars is around the 13th century BCE. and that makes Panini at most a contemporary of Ashvaghosha.  
  

I am a scientist by profession and took to Indological studies when I found that the main line of academic scholars are interested only in producing quick publications and they did not have time and inclination for certain serious issues, which demanded more time andthose works may even be considered thankless. It may also be that their academic responsibilities restricted their scope and freedom. For me no such restrictions apply.  
  
That is why I took up (a) the task of working on the original Bhagavad Gita of 745 Verses and the book will be published soon. (b) I also took up the date of Mahabaharata war, at first through historical studies followed by astronomical studies and I found that the war indeed took pl;ace towards the end of 3139 BCE. I could find the three consecutive eclipses within which there was an eclipse pair meeting the 13-days interval. No scholar could find hese eclipses in 3139 BCE so far. Here I have differed from Dr. Achar. (c) I worked towards establishing the dating of Lord Buddha and my paper on Dotted Records was for that. The paper is freely available in the Internet. (d) I worked on the Chaturyuga scale as given in the Suryasiddhanta and the Puranas, which have been misinterpreted by most of the scholars. (e) I worked on the date of Adi Shankaracharya. (f) I also worked on the dating of Lord Ram, as that issue also remains unsolved till this day as the dates found by Dr. Vartak, Pushkar Bhatnagar and others had been challenged by scholars and shown to be wrong. God willing I should be able to publish some of these works in course of time, but unlike other authors I began sharing my views in advance as my reserach progressed.  
  

Regards,  

Sunil KB
