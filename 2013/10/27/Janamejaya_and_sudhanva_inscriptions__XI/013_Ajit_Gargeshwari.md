Dear Sunil Bhattacharya,  
  
I am new here and would like to seek your guidance on this. I am encouraged from you mails and would like to know further details you have with you.  

  

Dwarka Math may not be lying that doesn't mean what they say based on a secret copper plate inscription should be accepted as a historical fact.  

As I have said before let us not go into Mathas and their chronology as it is a sensitive issue.  

  
There are so many Vikramas, heads of Shankra maths who called themselves as Shankaracharyas , finally Kanishka 1 and 2 known to history.  
  
Placing Asvagosha in 13 century BC goes against all accepted chronology as history is known to historians.  
  

Which historical studies that have shown Panini lived after Asvagosha? Which studies have shown Asvagosha to be a contemporary of Kanishka? How do you say Shuddha-Magadhi was spoken during 19th century BCE and Ardha-Mgagadhi was spoken during 6th century BCE?  

  

  

Where has Panini said he has seen" unwelcome changes in the Sanskrit starting from the Vedic Sanskrit" and hence he is writing new system of grammar. I would like to be pointed to the precise reference of Panini.  

  

Do you have any published papers reviewed in an peer to peer journal or any books you have written on your claims or is it a theory you are proposing? You have answered this question, as of now since no book or paper of yours is not published scholars can exercise the discretion of accepting or rejecting such a theory . I would like to be pointed towards published books and articles for these dates not hypothesis and I am ready to wait.
