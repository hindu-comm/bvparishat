Namaste,  
  

The deatils of the text of Sudhanva's inscription is available at the Dwaraka math but the actual Copper plate inscription is no longer there at present. I had been to the Dwaraka math personally and could not see the original inscription. I could only find the copy of the Inscription. I was told that the inscription was handed over to the Government (i.e., probably to Mr. Cunningham the then head of the Archaeology department of the British Government). It would have been good if at least a photograph of that inscription could have been obtained. It is quite possible that the British could have sent the copper plate to the British Museum or could have even destroyed it (the copper plate), for the reason that a proof of the 6th century BCE date of Shankaracharya would have challenged the Aryan Invasion Theory. Sometime back I wrote a letter to Dr. Gautam Sen Gupta, the Director general of the Archaeological Survey of India with a request to help find the record of Sudhanva's copper inscription the records of his department but it seems my request has fallen in deaf ears and I did not even get any acknowledgement of my letter.  
  

Regards,
