Dear friends.,  
  
One thing is for sure that the mathas have no reason to lie. The Shringeri matha has not been luing when it said that Adi Shankara was born on the 14th year of the reign of Vikramaditya and there was indeed one Vikramaditya, who died in 457 BCE and there was the Vikrama Era, which was superceded by the latter Vikrama Era of 57 BCE. AlbEruni does mention that. That Vikramaditya was known to Hala or Purnavarman, who lived in the junction of the 5th and the 6th century BCE.  
  

The Dwaraka math is also not lying when it speaks of the grant by Sudhanva. The accusing finger can go to the British authorities, who had every reason to gain by hiding the copper grant, for the reason I mentioned in my last mail. In fact there is every reason to agree that the Dwarka Matha authorities were persuaded to part with the copper inscritption, in favour of safe-keeping by the archaeological authorities of the day.  
  

It would have been of great interest if that copper plate inscriptions would have been available so that the script could have been studied by the linguists. But here also one thing is sure that the Linguists have never been known to say emphatic yes to anything. Lord Buddha's texts are in Shuddha Magadhi or Pali, which became the classical language in order to preserve the purity of the many Buddhist scriptures, which have been written in that. Lord Mahavira's texts are in Ardhamagadhi, which evolved from Shuddha-Magadhi over several centuries and that itself shows that Lord Mahavira was born centuries later than Lord Buddha, but no linguist woth his salt ever poited that out. But it is very clear now that Lord Buddha lived 13 centuries before Lord Mahavira.  
  

Regards,
