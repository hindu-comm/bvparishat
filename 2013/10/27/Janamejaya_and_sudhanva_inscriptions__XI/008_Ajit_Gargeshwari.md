Dear Sunil Bhattachrya,  
  

You are participating discussions on 3 threads. Please give us some tangible and concrete evidence to the views you are proposing. If you have given such evidence it is fine. 'Tit of Tat" replying is not going to help any one. If you are prolonging threads without any further evidence nothing fruitful can be gained.  
  

Let us treat views expressed by math's with sensitivity. Their views are their views.  
  

No modern researcher with any historical sense if ever going to believe or accept " That Vikramaditya was known to Hala or Purnavarman, who lived in the junction of the 5th and the 6th century BC."  
  

Copper plates produced as evidences might be spurious unless it is given into the hands of historians for examination it is never any evidence at all.  

Some orthodox tradition fix the date of Shankara at 5 century BC. Such an obviously observed date does not require any serious considerations at all. Attempts to fix the date of shankra on the Basis of positions of planets given in the biogrphies is of no use as all the biographies are late and not dependable.  
  

Some historians have tried to find historical personages is his sutra bhashya. All such identifications are arbitrary; there is no evidence to show any historical person was intended. Has Shankara explicitly an clearly said so? No he has not.  
  

Many works are attributed Shankara and one can clearly see many of them are late works and are not works Shankara the Sutra Bhashya authors. Arguments based on doubtful works cannot be taken as historical evidences.  
  

In this scenario a reasonable way of arriving at his date is to closely considers Shankara's thought in relation other philosophers such as Mandana Mishra, Vachaspati, Bhaskara, Kamalasila, Dharmakirti, Kumarila and arrive at a relative chronology not an absolute date till we have conclusive and undisputed evidence to prove one date or the other.
