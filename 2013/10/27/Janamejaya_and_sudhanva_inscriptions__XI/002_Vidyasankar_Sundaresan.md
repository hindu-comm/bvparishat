The so-called sudhanva grant has never been made available for study. The text provided in Jayanta Misra's article is the same as what has been produced before in a host of publications, for more than a century now. Averyclear andat-times-entertaining, at-times-infuriatingread of the matter can be found in Varanasi Rajagopal Sharma's Hindi book, jagadguru SAnkara maTha vimarSa. We can construct conspiracy theories of why it has never been possible for anyone to produce the original inscription or we can take a broad look at the entire situation and judge whether a copper-plate inscription from before 500 BCEexisted to begin with. Anyone familiar with the documented history of brAhmI and kharoshThI scripts should enquire into the original scriptin whichthe deed by this sudhanvan was recorded, how it was deciphered and what else can be gleaned from it about the language used for royalgifts 2500 years ago.



Re: the Janamejaya grant, Sri Kota Venkatachalam claims that there was a Jangama Matha headed by one Goswamy Anandalinga Jangama with a disciple named Jnanalinga Jangama at the time of Janamejaya, great-grandson of Arjuna, the Pandava, managing the Kedarnath temple from Ushamath (Ukhimath?). He provides text in Devanagari script. The ancientindians blog site gives the text in Telugu script and mentionsthe gotra of janamejaya asvaiagrani vayaghra (vaiyAkaraNa? vyAghra?). Note that there is a vyAghra gotra among the Paliwal Rajputs, whilch underlies the modern surname Waghela.



Perhaps the next date to be revisited is that of Basava, the leader of thevIraSaiva-s and Siva-SaraNa-s? He had to have lived in the Treta or Dvapara Yuga if there were already Jangama Mathas this early in the Kali yuga! Prudence demands that one should ask, is it not possible thatthe Jangamwadi Math that has managed the Kedarnath temple for a few centuries is laying claim to a far-fetched history of 5000+ years? And again, shouldn't oneenquire into the original scriptin whichthe deed by Janamejaya was recorded, how it was deciphered and what linguistic features can be gleaned from 5000 years ago?



Best regards,
