This all copper plates were written in what Script ?  
  

We find only Brahmi Script from Ashokan Period. Kharosthi also little bit earlier. similarly Tamil Brahmi  
  

Earliest Indus-Harappan/Sindhu-Saraswati Script is yet to be fully deciphered. The content is normally very few characters.  
  
  

I m 100% doubtful abt Janamejaya inscriptions !
