Dear Aklujkarji,  
  

It seems you are new to the controversy about the date of Adi Shankaracharya and that means I shall have to apprise you from the beginning and it will be a very time consuming job. If you want to delve into it you will have to be prepared to spend time and efforts. As you are new to it you will have endless questions. I am not discouraging you but if you want all the details from me you can have it, if and when I write a detailed paper or a book on it. It took me years of study and investigation on Adi Shankara's date to arrive at the conclusion I have reached. Of course, if you think that the Dwarka math could be lying and the British authorities are above board, then you don't need to go into this topic at all. That is because prof. Max Muller, working for the Britishers, had come to the conclusion that Adi Shankara was born in 788 CE.  
  

Anyway I will give you brief details, more to serve as clues, as to how you can proceed if you like  

  

If my memory serves me right the paper on Sudhanva's inscription as published in Vimarsh, was written by the 73rd Shankaracharya of the Dwarka math Sri Rarashwar Shankershram in 1897 CE. I read the details during my personal visit to the Dwarka math. My efforts to locate Sudhanva's copper plate inscription did not yield any fruit. You may try to find that if you so wish.  
  

As regards Ashwaghosha I don't need to have to separately prove that Ashwaghosha was living in the 13th century BCE. That is because I showed that his contemporary Kanishka was living in the 13th century BC.  
  

As regards Shuddha-Magadhi or Pali versus the Ardha-Magadhi or Jaina prakrit I have shown (on the basis of historical investigations) that the former was the spoken language of the 19th century BCE and the latter of the 6th century BCE. I have drawn my conclusions as it appeared logical to me and you can draw your own conclusions. No quarrel on that.  

  

You are a well known Sanskrit scholar, yet it appears to me that you are unable to accept that chronologically the classical Sanskrit was later than the Buddhist hybrid Sanskrit. Historical studies have shown that Panini was living at a later period than Ashvaghosha. Seeing the unwelcome changes in the Sanskrit starting from the Vedic Sanskrit, the great stalwart Panini very well could have got motivated to take up the cudgel to write his Ashtadhyayi.  
  

As regards the rejection of the pauranic chronology by the historians you referred to the the cause is crystal-clear. They did not pauranic chronology to contests the AIT (Aryan Invasion Theory) chronology.  

  

Regards,
