Dear Ajitji,  
  

I have no desire to prolong the discussions. What I said is that from my research I have come to the conclusion that Adi Shankaracharya was born in 509 BCE and I wish to apprise the scholars of the salient features of the new work. To my knowledge more and more people are accepting this date and I understand that even Kengo Harimoto is in the process of revising his paper on the date of Adi Shankaracharya, in view of the recently acquired data.  
  

Regards,
