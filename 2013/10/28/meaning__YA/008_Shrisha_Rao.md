In fact, that would be closer to "conceit" (which is not synonymous with self-esteem, "confidence in one's own worth or abilities; self-respect" per OED), cf. आत्मनैव स्वेनैव सम्भाविताः बहुमताः वयं पूज्या इति मन्यमाना इति यावत् \| अत एव स्तब्धाः अनम्राः धननिमित्तगर्वदर्पाभ्यां उपेतास्ते ... (राघवेन्द्रतीर्थीय गीतार्थसङ्ग्रह), etc.  
  
Some of the suggested translations are possibly based on misunderstanding self-esteem as connoting a negative trait, which it does not. Likewise, there is no need to consider अभिमान as always meaning दुरभिमान either. That is a reason I personally like the reading दम्भो दर्पोऽतिमानश्च क्रोधः पारुष्यमेव च (defining असुरलक्षण in XVI-4) rather than the vulgate with अभिमानः; अतिमानः clearly means प्रमाणातिक्रमः, always negative.
