Usha Ji is correct, but there is no need to coin any new term. The etymological meaning ofमान (root /maa/) is not different from "measurement". Hence, sva+maana is nearest to self+estimation, and therefore the existing word**स्वाभिमान** or svaabhimaanais sufficient, provided it is not coloured with the egotistical flavours ofअभिमान (abhimaana).**आत्म-सम्मान** is a similar term, from similar root
/maa/.

  

Etymological meaning of Sanskrit terms are not very different from or opposite to popular usages. But it is not so in Prakrits &c. For instance, the etymological meaning of estimation is "determining whether something exists or not" (asti \> esti), which later gave the meaning "measurement of existence", existence subdued later under the weight of measurement.

  

**स्वाभिमान orआत्म-सम्मान** are foreign to Vedic usages. I wonder whether these words can be found in any text of the ****so-called****
Vedic Period of History. **Anyone having real atma-gyaana cannot worry for atma-sammana**. Atma-sammana is valuable only for those who have not found their atman and are worrying only for sammana (for the ahamkaara/ego and not for the real atman). For the real atma-gyaani (jnaani), atman is not different from Brahma. Or atman is same as sarvam. Hence Sarv \> salv\* \> selv\* \> self ??? Self-esti... = sarva-asti... ?? Do I sound absurd ? See<http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=self> it reconstructs PIE of /self/ wrongly, but PGmc is almost correct, /f/ was earlier /v/ (and not /bh/) ; and the collective meaning was present in earlier forms which was later lost tand /self/ became singular in number. Hence, sarva-sammana was real atma-sammana.

  

I hope I have not bruised the atma-sammana of anyone here by stating these heretical views !!
