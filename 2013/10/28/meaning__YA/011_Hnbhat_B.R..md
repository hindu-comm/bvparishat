Good Question. Parsed into parts:

  

1\. Whether any of the words suggested, were used in ancient Vedic Texts?

2\. If used, whethere they are used to mean self-esteem?

3\. In not used in Vedic Literature, how can they can be taken to mean Self-esteem?

4\. The word Self esteem itself being an English word used in specific contexts, how can they be compared with the usages, even if



used?

  

I have no answers. But I found one word similar to आत्मसंभावना - आत्मसंभावितः

  

not in Vedic Literature, but in महाभारतम्-07-द्रोणपर्व-039used in a different context, meaning pride.

  



संरक्ष्यमाणो द्रोणेन मन्यते वीर्यमात्मनः।  

आत्मसम्भावितो मूढस्तं प्रमथ्नीत माचिरम्।।

evidently not in the sense of self-esteem. And to the contrary, आत्मसंभावना found in VS Apte's dictionary.\[आत्म**-**संभावना****self-conceit; K

  

Here is one usage in the same meaning: in śrīviṣṇudharmottarapurāṇa:

  

  

श्रीभगवानुवाच

आत्मसंभावना तार्क्ष्य न कार्या ते कदाचन ।

अहमेवात्मनात्मानं वहामि त्वां च धारये ॥ ३,३४३.२१ ॥

  

and both of these are not in the Vedic Literature, but in the epic literature and as can be seen, in the examples, they stand for self-pride.
