Namaste

Self-Esteem is a technical word. And it needs some new coined Sanskrit term for relating to Psychology.

We cannot use existing words, because they may lead to confusion. They are used popularly to denote different senses; so may not contain the sense a scientific term should hold.

Primarily though the word "esteem" has "high" and "good" sense in it, we use it in Psychology as "evaluate", how you estimate yourself. Self-esteem can be negative, bad, weak as well.

So words गौरव, अभिमान, उत्कर्षः etc. will mean on positive, high side; they may not express negative, weak sense.

So something like -मान्यता, भावना- "how one looks, considers and thinks about oneself" may show the true sense in it.
