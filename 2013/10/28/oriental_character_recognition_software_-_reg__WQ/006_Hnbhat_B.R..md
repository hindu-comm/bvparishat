Sorry. I could not find any video, but a png file which gives some pictures.  

  

From what Mr. Marcis has written, it is working in Win.7 version and later versions of Windows. So it may not be working in Win.XP

Is there any solution than installing Win.7 for the purpose?

  

That was my query.
