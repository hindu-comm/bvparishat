Namaste,

  

 Demo is installing without any issues on Win7. Amba Kulkarni is not technical support for OCR, so you better watch my video and try to solve it without her helping hand,<http://samskrtam.ru/hellwigs-devanagari-ocr/>

Try to copy some text from the OCR .pdf to a text editor - it's Unicode devanagari.

Now (the latest paid) version can make batch importing, recognition and saving.

Even compiling a .pdf file with an OCR layer. It was a [long journey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7RaiSdDyY8).
