Dear and Respected Scholars,

  

The Book on Sanskrit in Postage Stamps authored by Dr.T. Mahender is not available in the Chinmaya Institution at Kerala..

  

I shall be much obliged, if you can advise me the mode of payment - preferably through NEFT - and I will send Rs.200 + plus postage charges on your confirmation.  I want to send a copy of the Book to a Russian Scholar who has shown interest in the Book as my Compliment.

  

I look forward with interest for a early response.  I have to state that I am not a Sanskrit Scholar, retired from a MNC but interested in the language.

  

Compliments of the Season and the Best.

  

R. Ramanisundaram,

Beryl Bay, AI-55 (New 205), Flat 2B,

Shanthi Colony, Annanagar, Chennai 600 040. India.
