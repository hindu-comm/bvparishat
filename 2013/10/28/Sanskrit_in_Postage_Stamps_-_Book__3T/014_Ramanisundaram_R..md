I am in agreement with you; I feel the Author and Publisher are being different, the Publisher is responsible for marketing.  Therefore, I wrote to them.

  

A friend of mine, who is a Director in one of the Chinmaya Organisation was visting Ernakulam and requested him to buy it. I understand from him, the book is yet to be sent to them.

  

Regards.
