Reviewer : K S Kannan



    It is a matter of pleasure to introduce ***Bhåìga-märgaù***, a collection of short poems written by a contemporary poet - scholar Vidwan Umakantha Bhatta. The author is a Professor of Präcéna Nyäya in the Sanskrit College at Melkote. The book was awarded the Hiriyanna Praçasti (instituted after late Prof. M. Hiriyanna, Professor of Philosophy, Mysore University) by Karnataka Samskrit University (for the year 2013).The book is dedicated to Mahämahopädhyäya Late Çré N S Ramabhadracharya (Prof. of Nyäya at Sanskrit College, Mysore), under whom the author received his training in Nyäya.

   

   The book has a Foreword by Prof. Mallepuram G Venkatesh, D.Litt., Vice Chancellor of Karnataka Samskrit University, who suggested the book its title, so reflective of the contents of the book as well as the pursuits of the author. The book is a collection of over 30 poems divided under 5 sections.

  

   The opening section speaks as the voice of the author-poet. The very first poem is the editorial that he wrote in verse for his own Magazine of Sanskrit Verse, entitled *Chandasvaté*, reflected in the caption of the poem. The poet considers the magazine, or equally the poem, as his daughter, and the cordial filial relation between the two is well set forth in several verses.

  

   The next section contains a set of 9 poems, of which two poems address two great personages of our own times viz. H H Sri Raghaveshvara Bharati (of Ramachandrapura Matha), and the great Nyäya scholar (referred to above), who taught, coincidentally, both the author and the Swamiji. The young Bharati Swamiji is verily the Voice of India : *bhäraté* *bhäratéyänäm*, to quote his own words. As to the second, apart from his scholarship which is immense, one profound merit of Sri Ramabhadracharya that the author chooses to extol is his utter straightforwardness (*manasi vacasi karmaëyekarüpä pravåttiù*), a cardinal virtue so rare these days, and the extraordinary clarity in his thought and speech. Another poem gives a rousing call to Sanskrit scholars ("jägåhi jägåhi saàskåta-vidvan") to see through the modern mischievous games such as the pitting of Sanskrit against the vernaculars, and be on the alert. Another poem is a tribute to the age-old Melkote Pathashala.Mahämahopädhyäya N Ranganatha Sharma, a giant grammarian of Karnataka, is another scholar praised in another poem.

  

   The poetic service of Prof. H V Nagaraja Rao, and the man of vision that Prof. Mallepuram G Venkatesh is, are also treated in two poems. Tributes are paid to a few more poets/scholars of Karnataka. The work ends with two verses in *citrabandha,* "diagrammatic poetry". On the whole, the small book marks a neat production in terms of content as well as get-up. The book provides a window on the creativityof Sanskrit poets, and deserves to be welcomed whole-heartedly by all lovers of Sanskrit.
