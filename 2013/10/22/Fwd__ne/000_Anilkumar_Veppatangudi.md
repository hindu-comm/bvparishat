Dear Anil Kumarji,

While doing research on the tribes in India, I discovered that elephants have been used as part of war machinery, an insignia of royalty and also it is considered sacred. Obviously there must have been close connection between those who used elephants, the supplier( catchers and trainers) and traders of elephants. I would like to know specific references and also names of the communities of suppliers, catchers and trainers of elephants. Any help in this regard from you and group of sanskrit scholars will be greatly appreciated.
