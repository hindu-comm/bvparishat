Namaste,

  

I read this 93 MB document and was astonished at the similarities among hieroglyphs and logographic symbols from distant cultures in America and Mediterranean. There must be some linguistic similarity too. Such phenomena were noticed earlier too, but mainstream "scholars" always suppress such discoveries.
