Namaste



May I seek the opinion –review of traditional scholars on the resource provided at the url below , on the topic of paleo Sanskrit ? Will this push history of Sanskrit to 12000 years BCE ?



<http://www.human-resonance.org/Sanskrit.pdf> ( a document of about 200 plus pages with many illustrations and glyph readings which may be relevant to Sanskrit teams and history)



These are Dr.Kurt Schildmann's logographic Sanskrit Decipherment (Year
1999) in relation to Southern Illinois Caves - Indigenous Native American Tribes and Sanskrit ? connection ?



Points of interest : (Page 128) –Kundalini 



**Evidence can not be questioned as it is a fact. Interpretations can vary in as many ways as scholars see and think.**
