One thing to remember in this context is that we do not still know what the ancient Brahmi really looked like. The name Brahmi given to the script found in "A;sokan" inscriptions and the inscriptions on some SriLankan potsherds etc. (claimed by some to be more ancient than"A;sokan" inscriptions)is a case of good guessing. We still have not found (a) a specimen where that sort of script is found with the specification Brahmi attached to it or (b) a description of Brahmi characters which matches with the writing instances now claimed to be Brahmi. In other words, a confirmation that we are justified in attaching the detail "Brahmi" to what we now regard as instances of Brahmi writing is still wanted. See Richard Salomon, *Indian Epigraphy*, pp. 8-10 and 17-19.
