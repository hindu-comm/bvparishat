Namaste,  
  

The book was published by the Kolkata publishers Firma K. L. Mukhopadhyay in 1962. I do not know if that publisher is still active in business. The Worldcat list shows that the book is available in 24 libraries outside India. I have my copy in Mumbai but I am away from Mumbai now. May be some forum members living in Kolkata may throw more light on its availabilty now.
