Dear Dr. Rani Sadashiva Murty,  
  

My attempt to answer the mail failed and I was informed that the Sanskrit part of my mail is not acceptable to this group.  
  

These restrictions are imposed by Google and not BVP as group. Thanks for Mailing the same as a PDF attachment.  

  

  

Regards  
Ajit Gargeshwari

अजो नित्यः शाश्वतोऽयं पुराणो न हन्यते हन्यमाने शरीरे।।2.20।।
