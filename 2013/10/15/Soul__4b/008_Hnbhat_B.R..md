One can read the answer given to the question raised by Naciketa, in कठोपनिषत् about the life after dearth:

  

येयं प्रेते विचिकित्सा मनुष्येऽस्तीत्येके नायमस्तीति चैके ।

एतद्विद्यामनुशिष्टस्त्वयाहं वराणामेष वरस्तृतीय : ॥२०॥

  

  

which has given us the कठोपनिषत् from the second chapter forward what happens to the soul after death.
