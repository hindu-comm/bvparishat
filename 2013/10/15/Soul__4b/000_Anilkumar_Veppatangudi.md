A fundamental question on soul.

When a child is conceived by the fertilisation of the egg by the sperm, a new life is born. How does the soul enter into the new born? We know from science that genetic imprints from the genes of the parents get transferred and probably mutated. What about the effects of one's karma? How do they get transferred? Can physical quantification be done as with genes? Also, how are effects of Karma carried by the soul which is reborn if not physically?
