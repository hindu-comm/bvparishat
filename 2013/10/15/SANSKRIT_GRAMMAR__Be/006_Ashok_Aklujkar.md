What holds good for the object language (the language being described) need not hold good in the metalanguage (the language which describes). Especially in grammar, if sandhi found in the object language is rigorously applied in the metalanguage, it may give a distorted picture of the cited forms. Through suutras such as sva.m ruupa.m ;sabdasya (na tu artha.h) ... Paa.nini indicates his awareness of the 'language : metalanguage' distinction. See Scharfe, Hartmut. 1971. Panini's Metalanguage, Philadelphia: American Philosophical Society and my review (in English) of it in Orientalistische Literaturzeitung 72, Jahrgand 1977, Nr. 3) pp. 300-309; also Palsule, G.B. 1970. "Some views of Panini and his follower on object language and meta-language," Publications of the Centre of Advanced Study in Sanskrit, University of Poona.  
  
It is possible that in several A.s.taadhyaaii-suutras sandhi has been applied out of habit and the original reading free from sandhi application has been lost over the centuries.
