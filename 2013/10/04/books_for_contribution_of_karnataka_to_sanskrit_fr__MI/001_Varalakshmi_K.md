Sanskrit Academy, Hyd, has published two books namely Surivijayah and Surapurasamkshiptarajakeeya Itihasah. These two books briefly narrate the history of Surapura Rajyam which is now called as Shorapur near Gulbarga. The rulers of Surapura Rajyam were patrons of great Sanskrit Scholars who authored many Sanskrit works. Surivijaya gives the account of a great Sanskrit scholar Kiriti Venkatacharya.
