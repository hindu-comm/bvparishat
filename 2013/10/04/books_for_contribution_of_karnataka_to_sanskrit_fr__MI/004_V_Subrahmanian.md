The pUrNaprajna samshodhana mandiram, Bangalore, has brought out **very recently** a small book titled 'Original Sanskrit Works of **Modern** Scholars from Karnataka' giving a list a various titles and names of the authors. It covers works from all shAstra-s. Dr.A.V.Nagasampige, Director of PPSM, can be contacted for purchase of this book, which is very nominally priced.
