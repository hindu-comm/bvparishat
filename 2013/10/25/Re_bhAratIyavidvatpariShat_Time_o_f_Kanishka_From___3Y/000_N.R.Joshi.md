Dear Shri Sunil Bharttacharya, This has to do with your time table of Buddha and Kanishka.



This is not a new thread. Kanishka was king of Kushanas. His broken statue is found in Afghanistan. According to your time table Kushanas were ruling Afghanistan in 612 BC.Where did Kushanas come from to Afghanistan? and where were Shakas located in 612 BC? Greeks called all people north of Persian Empire Scythians.
