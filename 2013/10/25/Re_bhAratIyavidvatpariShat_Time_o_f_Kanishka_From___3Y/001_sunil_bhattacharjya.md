Dear Dr. N.R. Joshi,

  

Where did I say that the Kushanas were ruling Afghanistan in 612 BCE ?  
  
You asked me two questions and I gave the reply to the best of my knowledge, in order to share my knowledge with you. I never said that the Kushanas were ruling Afghanistan in 612 BCE. I was only referring to the date of the Kushana king, Kanishka, as seen in the Rajatarangini as well as from the astronoimical determination of Kaniska's date by Dr. Narahari Achar. **Kanishka was a Kushana king and he was living around 13th century BCE. He did extend his territory to Afghanistan.**  
  

As regards the date of 612 BCE I wrote as follows:  

Quote  
Further as you are aware of the Iranian History you could also be aware that the Assyrian empire collapsed when the joint forces of the Babylonians, Scythians and Medes captured Nineveh in 612 BCE.  

Unquote  
  

I now realize that my assumption that you are aware of the Iranian History was not correct.  

  

Sincerely,  

SKB
