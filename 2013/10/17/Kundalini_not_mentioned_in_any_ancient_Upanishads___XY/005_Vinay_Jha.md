Namaste,

  

It is interesting to note that "Kundalini" is not found in Vedic literature by Sampat Ji. May I ask what is the aim of such a pursuit ? If Kundalini is a non-Vedic invention, what does it prove ? Here I list some conclusions which may be drawn from this discussion :

\(1\) Vedic rishis had no knowledge of Kundilini and were quite deficient in this field of knowledge.

(2)Vedic culture evolved in time, from inferior to superior states.

(3)Kundalini-related Tantra may be quite different in origins from the Vedic texts, perhaps non-Aryan.

(4)Western scholars are authorities in Vedic knowledge.

(5)Eagerness to discard texts like Markandeya Purana, which mention Kundalini, on the basis of their supposed later dating as concluded by Western "indologists" is in tune with above conclusions.

(6)In same spirit, evidences of Kundalini in Upanishadic literature is also discarded. For instance, Prashnopanishad ( प्रश्नोपनिषद् ) was discussed and discarded.

  

Here, I cite one example from the same text (प्रश्नोपनिषद्):

अथेमे अन्य उ परे विचक्षणे सप्तचक्रे षडर आहुरर्पितमिति

Can any horse or bullock driven vehicle have seven wheels ? Such vehicles need even number of wheels, not odd numbers. Or should we suppose seven-wheeler like modern three-wheelers ? The context is spirituality, pertaining to praana and the Supreme. In same upanishad, we are told that there is one extra Naadi besides the 100 Naadis with branches and sub-branches, and through this extra Naadi the Jeeva leaves this body. Kathopanishad reinforces this : there are 101 Naadis coming out of Hridaya, through 100 naadis the Jeeva leaves to get into various yonis but the extra naadi is for emancipation from the cycle of rebirths. Is that extra naadi different from sushumnaa of tantric literature ? Why is this naadi mentioned separately from the others, and why it is different from the rest ? Because it is dormant for all those Jeevas who do not deserve Moksha. In other words, Kundalini sleeps in such persons. Mundakopanishad puts the entire Vedic knowledge (related to karmakaanda) in the category of "aparaa vidyaa", and pursuit of the Ultimate Being is classed under "paraa" vidyaa. The saptachakra of Prashnopanishad should be related to the "सप्त प्राणाः प्रभवन्ति तस्मात् ..." verse of Mundakopanishad which describes seven praanas (two more than five famous praanas), seven agnis, seven samidhaas, seven homas, seven lokas, in which the praanaas roam inside the ("guhaa" (of hridaya) where "sapta-sapta" entities reside. Each entity divides into seven in the seven chakras. Mundakopanishad describes ("अरा इव रथनाभौ ...") the multitudes of naadis collected in the navel-like location (hridaya) where the Supreme Being resides. Shvetaashvataropanishad describes the
Shakti of Deva ("ते ध्यानयोगानुगत अपश्यन्  देवात्मशक्तिं स्वगुणैर्निगूढाम्") in the language of geometric symbolism found in tantric literature : तमेकनेमीम् त्रिवृतम् षोडशांतम् शतार्धारम्
विंशतिप्रत्यराभिः। अष्टकैः षडभिर्विश्वरूपैकपाशम् त्रिमार्गभेदम् द्विनिमित्ततैकमोहम्।।४।। Throughh misapplication of logic, we can deduce any meanings we want out of these statements, but these upanishads forbid us from applying logic in this field : Nachiketa is told by Lord of Death in Kathopanishada "नैषा तर्केण मतिरापनेया" (such an intellect as yours cannot be obtained through logic). At the end of Aitareya upanishad, we are told twice : परोक्षप्रियाः इव ही देवाः परोक्षप्रियाः इव ही देवाः(gods like indirect allusions). Mundakopanishad describes the requisite qualities of an aspirant of Brahmavidyaa (क्रियावन्तः श्रोत्रिया ब्रह्मनिष्ठाः ....). taittiriyopanishad describes the upper end of Sushumnaa naadi under the label Indrayoni (the gayeway to Supreme Being, Brahmarandhra at Keshaanta) : अन्तरेण तालुके। य एष स्तन इवावलंबते। सेन्द्रयोनिः। यत्रासौ केशान्तो विवर्तते। व्यपोह्य शीर्षकपाले। ... (Indra is Supreme Being or the Saakshi Bird who perceives only and does not participate in the carnival of sense organs, see the "परोक्षप्रियाः इव..." verse cited above).

  

In this context I want to highlight a neglected aspect of Vedic knowledge. Take the case of Dhanurveda, an upaveda of YV. After discussing 'shastras', Vasishtha Dhanurveda says in the context of
'astras' :

  

Brahmaastra needs japa of savitri in reverse order ("सावित्रीं विपरीताम् जपेत्"). Brahmadanda also uses reverse saavitri but not in reverse ordering of syllables as in Braahmaastra, but in reverse ordering of words as follows :

  

ब्रह्मदण्डं प्रवक्ष्यामि प्रणवं पूर्वमुच्चरत्

ततः प्रचोदयाज्-ज्ञेयं ततो नो यो धियः क्रमात्

ततो धीमहि देवस्य ततो भर्गो वरेण्यं

सवितुस्तच्च योक्तव्यममुकशत्रुं तथैव च ।।85।।

ततो ह्न ह्न हुं फट् जप्त्वा पूर्वं द्विलक्षकम्

अभिमन्त्र्य शरम् तद्वत प्रक्षिपेच्छत्रुषु स्फुटं ।।86।।

नश्यन्ति शत्रवः सर्वे यमतुल्या अपि ध्रुवं

एतदेव विपर्य्यस्तम् जपेत् संहारसिद्धये ।।87।।

  

The tantric beeja ह्न ह्न हुं फट् is used just before unleasing the
'astra'. Should we suppose Vasishtha rishi was a Vaamamaargi tantric ? Eurocentric Indologists and their followers will discard Vasishtha Dhanurveda as a spurious text composed in mediaeval or modern era by some fraud. But what about other texts which support Vasishtha Dhanurveda ? For instance, Vishvaamitra Smriti, which goes a step further and describes the method and number of praanaayamas during which the japa of aforementioned mantras of seven divyaastras should be performed. Vishvaamitra is the rishi of Gaayatri and its variations, and is the ultimate authority of divyaastras. Even Vasishtha rishi sent his disciples to learn divyaastras from Vishvaamitra rishi. There are many other texts describing the reverse japa of Vedic mantras for siddhis. It is not easy to discard all these texts as spurious, because divyaastras are mentioned countless of times in ancient literature, and all the ancients believed in their reality, unlike the moderners who are unfit for divyaastras.

  

Under the guidance of my spiritual Guru Ji, I had performed exactly the same type of praanaayaama five hours a day for many years as mentioned in Vishvaamitra Smriti &c, but not in reverse savitri-japa because my aim was not divyaastra but self-purification. Kundalini-awakening must never be discussed publicly. What I want to state is that without Kundalini-jaagarana, no Vedic mantra can be properly used, either in yajna by a brahmin priest or in war by a kshatriya warrior. Vedic mantras are not for indological surgery by mlechchhas (here, the term "mlechchha" does denotes not any particular race or nation in modern world, but those persons who do not possess the samskaaras needed for using Vedic mantras ; hence no insult is intended here for any particular community). Dakshina-maargi use of Vedic mantras, as I did, is for spiritual gains. Vaama-maargi use of Vedic mantras, as cited above, is for attaining worldly siddhis such as divyaastras. During Kaliyuga, Vaamamaargi use of Vedic mantras went out of use due to lack of deserving users, and only the anti-Vedic Vaamamaargi Tantra has survived with vestiges of Vedic Vaamamaarga in it. Here is one example :

  

Gita says :

आब्रह्मभुवनाल्लोकाः पुनरावर्तिनो-अर्जुन ।

मामुपेत्य तू कौन्तेय पुनर्जन्म न विद्यते ।।8.16।।

  

Kularnava-Tantra says :

पीत्वा पीत्वा पुनर्पीत्वा यावत् पतति भूतले ।

पुनरुत्थानं वै पीत्वा पुनर्जन्म न विद्यते ।।

  

Last words (पुनर्जन्म न विद्यते) are same. It means emancipation from the cycle of rebirths is attained through attaining the Supreme Being according to Gita, but the same goal is attained by means of the tantric ritual of drinking (wine, one of the panch makaaras). Some tantriks say here wine is some special type of elixir. Whatever be the explanation, Vedic Tantra is quite different Non-Vedic Tantra, and both were co-existent from Time Immemorial.

  

I hope the "experts" would throw some light on the grammatical explanation and meaning of reverse japa of mantras like saavitri. It is noteworthy that many ancient scholars held that Vedic "mantras" have no meaning at all in the human / linguistic / grammatical sense (mantras are different from rchaa, yajur or saama ; gaayatri mantra is not same as gaayatri rchaa). Mantras are for Prayoga, not for scholarly dissection. Similarly, Kundalini is for awakening through well guarded saadhanaa and not for surgical operation on a public platform.

  

Sampath Kumar Medavarapu Ji writes : "Brahmanda Purana belongs to the period of 350–950 A.D". On what basis ? Just because some linguistic novices of Europe wrote so, whose ancestors learnt grammar only in modern era, unlike Indians ? Please discuss the foundations of Indo-Europeanism here before accepting their chronology.

  

I hope my words will be taken positively and not as personal affronts. I do not intend to belittle any individual, my targets are some ideas which have no solid foundations but are in the air due to political-economic reasons during past two centuries.
