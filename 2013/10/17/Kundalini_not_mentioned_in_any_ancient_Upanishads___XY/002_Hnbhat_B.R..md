From the योगकुण्डलिन्युपनिषत् describing कुण्डलिनी as the शक्ति. Etymologically, it is the feminine gender of कुण्डलिन् which means one having कुण्डल or bracelet or ring, in other words coiled one, or collection of it कुण्डलानां समूहः, is used an epithet of serpent as per Amara:

  

कुण्डली गूढपाच्चक्षुःश्रवाः काकोदरः फणी ।।१-८-७।।

  

and hence it seems it is called as serpent power.

  

कुण्डली गूढपाच्चक्षुःश्रवाः काकोदरः फणी ।।१-८-७।।

  

and depicted as serpent such in the above description descriptions, referring to hood फणा, and पुच्छ which makes the concept clear.

  

As said in the earlier post, it belongs to कृष्णयजुर्वेद.

  

Here is the English Translation of the Text:YOGAKUṆDALĪ -UPANISHAḌ

OFKṚSHṆA-YAJURVEḌA

From the title, it seems, it is named as कुण्डली, and कुण्डलिनी when referring to शक्ति which is feminine gender.

The date of this Upanishad is debatable for those who seek historicity of this concept. I have just cited the usages of the words in the above Upanishad-s.

It is possible कुण्डल-s refer to the Six Chakra-s, and the शक्ति conceived of consisting them, is properly called कुण्डलिनी, or कुण्डली (in masculine gender generally used for serpent).
