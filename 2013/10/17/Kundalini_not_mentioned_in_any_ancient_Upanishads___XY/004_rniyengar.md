I largely agree with the points brought out by Sri Sundaresan, which adds to the overall discussion. However I wish the first poster had described if not defined what is the 'KunDalinI' (K) concept for which he is seeking the historical origin or roots. This is so because K is an esoteric 'concept' which is at the intersection of the physical, the psychic and the spiritual. Is K the sensation one feels at the tip of the coccyx? or is it the just the TEXTUAL figure and description of a triangle with a coiled serpent etc at the base of a human being? If it is the latter it is better to make the stand crystal clear. This is so because many 'textual concepts' have come out of the 'revelations or experiences' of others who are not necessarily the authors of the texts. I had seen an article that Aryasamajins though being Vedics do not beleive in K becasue their founder could not find the chakras in a dissected body (I am writing from memory. If I am wrong I may be corrected & no offence meant). The thrust of my argument is if one has to search for the concept of 'K' in our tradition in the texts, no simplistic approach would suffice. We have to first collect all such (out-of) beyond-the-body concepts in the antecedent literature together and analyze the relations among them. Naturally this is an arduous task and I do not know whether this has been done already. If historicity has to be further superposed on the resulting lnkages one has to order or at least agree for a chronology starting from the R.gveda. The dichotomy that exists in our cultural history is that a time line can be worked out from Buddha, Mahavira (c 500 BC) onwards to arrange the later texts and concepts (I know some will not agree with this!). But many such concepts could have originated in the pre-Buddhist oral tradition texts namely the Vedas and the Vedangas.

Specific to the point under discussion namely 'K', my understanding is the phraseology is late but not the concept. After all Muulaadhara is one of the six (some texts seven) chakras. The Taittiriya AraNyaka in the well known Narayanopanishad already states three of them except they were synchronized with the upper part of the body.

This is of course too well known for me to labour on. Vishuddha, anaahata and MaNipura (or Nabhi) are attested here as esoteric SPACES. The language here is not symbolic, it is quite specific with even a length measure- Vitasti being mentioned. It appears as is common with tripartite division of GuNas: Satva, Rajas and Tamas, the Vedic-upasans appear to be stressing the Satvic-chakras (at least that is preserved). Later historical texts in line with the diffusion of secret Vedic concepts into the common populace have further diversified to explore and map out the Rajasic and the Tamasic (Svadhishthana & Mulaadhaara) parts of the human anatomy in tune with the Cosmic Order. I sincerely feel, any one searching for historicity of Hindu cultural/philosophical/mystical concepts should not stop at 100 AD or 100 BC. I request Sri Sampatkumar to first state clearly the dimension of 'K' for which he is searching the historical roots. I may seem to be naive, but I do not see how any one could have suddenly come out with the 'K' concept without an intellectual understanding (if not experiential) of the fundamental concept of Chidaakaasha and the Baahyaakaasha being connected if not seamlessly merging.
