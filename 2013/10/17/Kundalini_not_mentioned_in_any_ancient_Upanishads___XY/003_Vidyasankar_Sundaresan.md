To go back to the basic question raised by Sri Sampath Kumar:



Whenstudyingthe history of religious concepts and terminology, one has to distinguish between the thing and the name given to the thing. The word kuNDalinI is not to be found in the prinicipal upanishat texts (such as bRhadAraNyaka, taittirIya, chAndogya etc). However, all this indicates is that word kuNDalinImaynot be chAndasa in origin. It does not mean that one should necessarily deny an upanishadic basis forthe content of the meditative practices associated with what is today called kuNDalinI yoga.



If you ask what kuNDalinI really is, the dominant views among most practitioners is that it is a name for prANa, conceived of as a power, a Sakti, or that it is a name for cit, consciousness itself. There are other views about what kuNDalinI means, but all those variants talk of the concept of prANa/cit being felt along the spine and being concentrated upon by yogis,at different spots in the body. As for prANa itself, the word can mean more than the breath that we inhale and exhale. For example, all the senses are often clubbed together and collectively called prANa-s, in the vedAnta texts.



Therefore, the reference by Sankara in the gItAbhAshya 8.10, about the prANa rising upward through a central nADI (which occurs in many other places as well, especially in dicussions of krama mukti), being held in concentration between the eyebrows etc. needs to be analyzed carefully. This is about a deliberate meditative practice (manasA acalena -indicating an active control of the mind), not about how the jIva travels in the nADI-s during svapna or rests in sushupti. Similarly with the reference to an upward rising nADI in the taittirIya commentary. And when the upanishads say, tayordhvam Ayann amRtatvam eti, that also points to something deliberate in the quest for immortality. It isnot an accidental"spiritual feeling" or merely an anatomical event.



Whatever these meditative practices were in the time of Sankara or are today, they certainly had a pre-Sankaran vedAntic past. Could there have been texts that used the word kuNDalinI, dating to before Sankara? I don't think wecan know for sure. Yet, there had to have been pre-Sankaran texts that constituted "yogaSAstra" for Sankara, from where the references to sushumnA etc were prasiddha in his time. There had to have been more than the pAtanjala yogasUtra and its bhAshya available to him. Nevertheless, the dominant tendency within academic scholarship is that whenever descriptions of nADI-s and cakra-s are found in a text, a date not much earlier than the 10th century is assigned, the text is classified as belonging to tantra/Agama andperhaps reluctantly aligned with yoga,while any connection with anything vedAntic is either categorically denied or prematurely judged as "post-Sankaran."



Often, it seems to me me that "tAntrika" is merely a catch-all phrase to describe the "other" (like the category of "Dravidian" for some Sanskritists). It isa safety valve through which unexamined assumptions can pass off as if they were carefully considered conclusions. It is this dogma within academic scholarship that I challenge. And I would not bother to challenge it if it were something minor, but in reality, this attitude has far-reaching implications forthe vast majority of academic studies on what we callHinduism today, from the ancient Upanishads, Saivagamas and Pancaratra, rightdown to Ramakrishna Paramahamsa and Swami Vivekananda, along the way making numerous unwarranted judgements about the Sankara mathas, the Srivaishnava and Madhvatraditions, Kashmir Saivism, south Indian Saiva Siddhanta etc.



Best regards,

Vidyasankar
