Dear Indologists,  
  
I have been trying to find out the meaning of chāyāpuruṣa in the context of Tāntric texts. Monier Williams simply says 'Puruṣa in the form of a shadow' and Apte does not have it. How do I understand the expressions like chāyāpuruṣopadeśavidbhiḥ (Tantrāloka-viveka-3.5ab) or chāyāpuruṣopadeśapariśīlanena (Īśvarapratyabhijñā-vivṛti-vimarśinī, Vol.1, p. 159) or chāyāpuruṣaparīkṣāyāmityarthāt (Svacchandatantra-udyota 7.267)? Who are considered to be the learned people in the teachings of chāyāpuruṣa (chāyāpuruṣa-vid) ? I should be grateful if someone can guide me to the right sources or throw some light on chāyāpuruṣa. You can also write to me off-list.  
  
Best wishes.
