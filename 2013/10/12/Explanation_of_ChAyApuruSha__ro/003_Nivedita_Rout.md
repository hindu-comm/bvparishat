Chaayaapuru.sa is a yogic concept, meditation and practice. "siva is visualised as "[chaayaapuru.sa](http://chaayaapuru.sa)" by "saiva yogins to become master of living beings, to become "Siva himself, to become knower of past, present and future (Svarodaya tantra, 353-56). This Svarodaya tantra also describes the results, those depend upon the colors of [chaayaapuru.sa](http://chaayaapuru.sa) that the "saiva yogin visualises in his meditation i.e. if one sees "Siva as dark in colour he should know his age is of mere 6 months, if it is yellow then disease comes. For detail see (Svarodaya, 357-61). Many verses of this Svarodayatantra is found in the Brahmayaamala tantra and it seems this tantra was a part of Brahamayaamalatantra as described by Narapati (12th century?) in his text "Jayacarayaa" on astrology.

  

The Ni"svaasottarasuutra also refers about [chaayaapuru.sa](http://chaayaapuru.sa) as "siva and meditation upon him so it informs us about 4 types of dhyaanas such as tattvadhyaana, chaayaadhyaana, gho.sadhyaana & lak.syadhyaana. see 5.27.

  

The Kubjikaa tantra also referes to it in its [kaalaprakara.na](http://kaalaprakara.na). 23.16-43.

  

The 28th chapter of "Siva Puraa.na gives a complete description of this yogic mystic meditation and its results.

  

The earliest reference of [chaayapuru.sa](http://chaayapuru.sa) is in the Kau.satiki Upani.sad, 2.1.11-16.
