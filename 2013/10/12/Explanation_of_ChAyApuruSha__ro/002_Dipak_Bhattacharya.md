I do not know if it will profitably add to the conversation but there is a story with a moral about Chāyāpuruṣa current in Varanasi. A banker
(name will not be given) of Varanasi had assumed the form of or had made a Tantric assume the form of a Chāyāpuruṣa to lure away the widow of the daughter- in-law of the Diwan of a Central-South Indian state around the year 1900. The widow was killed after she had been made to surrender her jewellery. After the income from the property had been invested in his bank by the perpetrator of the crime the bank failed. Everything the criminal had went away with the bank. He died of heart attack.

A thin reflection of [Alexandre Dumas](http://www.towerbabel.com/author/153/alexandre-dumas/)?
