Here is one more version of the verse quoted by you:

  

हनूमति हतारामे वानराः हर्षनिर्भराः ।

  

रुदन्ति राक्षसाः सर्वे ***हा हारामो हतो हतः ॥***

  

which has the last पाद more meaningful. in a different way. It is here, the pun lies and not in the first, as it cannot be taken to mean when Hanuman killed Rama, as it can be split strictly हतः आरामो यस्मिन् तस्मिन्. and not आसमन्ताद् रामः यस्मिन्, which may somehow mean Rama for the riddle. In the last line, it can be split in both ways, हा हा आरामो हतः, or हा हा रामो हतः। And there were no monkeys along with हनूमान् when he broke the अशोकवन, which is meant here by आराम and means directly less.
