Dear friends,  
  

Several decades ago I heard two unusual verses, one of them is connected with the Ramayana and the other is seemingly connected with the Mahabharata but not really so.  
  
The one connected with the Ramayana is somewhat as follows:  
  

**"hanumAna hatArAma sitAharshamupAgatA rAkshashAh rodanti sarve hA hA rAma hatA hatA".**  
  

The other verse seemingly connected with the Mahabharata has the word
"**Drona**" in it but the similarity ends there and the word "**Drona**" in that verse probably means a crow.  
  
It will be good to know if any scholar of this forum can throw more light on these two verses.  
  

Regards,
