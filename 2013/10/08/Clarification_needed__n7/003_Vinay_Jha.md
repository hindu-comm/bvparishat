Meanings of terms change with the change in context, even if the language and cultural settings are unchanged. For instance, Akaash as Brahma and Akaash as one of the panch-bhootas are two different entities. Here, Vayu in ancient Indian texts is one of the panch mahaa-bhootas. The panch mahaa-bhootashave following tan-maatraas :

  

Akaash = Shabda

Vaayu  =Shabda+ Sparsha

Agni   =Shabda+ Sparsha + Roopa

Jala   =Shabda+ Sparsha + Roopa + Rasa

Prithvi =Shabda + Sparsha + Roopa + Rasa + Gandha  

  

Hence, the panch mahaa-bhootas are related to following Gyaana(Jnaana)-Indriyas :

  

Akaash = Ear

Vaayu  =Ear+ Skin

Agni   =Ear+Skin+ Eye

Jala   =Ear+Skin+Eye+ Tongue

Prithvi =Ear+Skin+Eye+Tongue+ Nose

  

These Indriyas are not the physical parts of body, but the sookshma entities associated with physical counterparts. These sookshma entities have respective deities and accompany the Jeeva after death.

  

Therefore, Vaayu is that element which has the properties related to two Indriyas : Ear and Skin, associated with two tanmaatraas :Shabda+ Sparsha.

  

Anything having the tanmaatraa "Shabda" does not have weight.

  

Anything having the tanmaatraa "Sparsha"doesnot have weight.  

  

Anything having the tanmaatraa "Roopa"doesnot have weight.  

  

Anything having the tanmaatraa "Rasa" must have weight.  

  

Anything having the tanmaatraa "Gandha" must have weight.  

  

The vaayus named udaan, vyaana, etc inside the body do not have weight and are not composed of material elements like nitrogen, oxygen, etc. But they possess the sensors for apprehendingShabda andSparsha.

  

Therefore, this Vaayu is different from the air of material sciences.
