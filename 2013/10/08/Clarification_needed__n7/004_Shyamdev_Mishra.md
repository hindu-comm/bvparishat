Respected All,

  

I don't get the Idea of Umesh ji regarding explanation of Vaayu tattva. His Interpretation that Light and Waves or Tarang both are moving entities thus can be considered as a form of Vaayu is quite Intriguing.  

  Light and Vaayu or Air both are different things all together.Both are the medium of Waves or Tarang. Wave is nothing but a phenomenon or disturbance that travels from one to another end through above mentioned mediums like Vaayu or Light or Water. As we know that water waves are called as *Urmi, Veechi* etc.But, medium do not make Waves or *Tarang* by itself
