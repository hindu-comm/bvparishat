Mahdev Rajaram Bodas in his introduction to his translation of Tarka sangraha had pointed out several concepts of Nyaya have to be reinterpreted and rewritten in the wake of modern science fifty or 95 years ago. Nyaya thought as methodology will remain for a long time but certain concepts they hold might require revision for instance the concept of sound.  
  
Why in the modern era, don't you think the concepts of Nyaya its metaphysics have been questioned right from the time Sriharsha and by buddhists before him. No conclusion is final.
