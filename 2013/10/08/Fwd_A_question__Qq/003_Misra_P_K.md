Thank you, Dr.Jagannathan and Dr. Anil Kumar.

May I also request you to let me have the translation of the verse and please clarify whether the term nishaadi can be considered as a generic term for tribal or it is a specific name of a tribal community. This is a crucial question in order to distinguish ( if at all ) between caste and tribe.

Will be grateful for your kind response.

P.K.Misra
