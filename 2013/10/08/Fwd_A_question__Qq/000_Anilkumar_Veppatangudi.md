Dear Dr.Anil Kumar,

I have been reading Prof. Iravati Karve's interpretation of Mahabharat. Prof. Karve was a renowned anthropologist. In one of the stories it is reported that Pandavas were sent to Varnavata where a combustible house was built for them. On the fateful night it is stated that a tribal woman came to the house with her five sons and slept there. In the night thr Pandavas slipped away but this tribal woman along with her sons perished in the fire.

There are several versions of this story. But that apart, I am interested to know is that in the Sanskrit text what is the term that was used for the tribal woman.

Please guide me.

With regards,
