There is a striking difference between the civet and musk deer. Civet is an animal of cat's family. Where as a musk deer is a kind of stag.  
The fragrant substance which in regional languages is called PUNUGU is produced from Civet and it is produced from the perineam glads (situated between its anus and genitals) of it.  
The KASTURI is produced from MUSK DEER's naval part. Kasturi is
different from PUNUGU. Kasturi is much costlier than PUNUGU. The Species of Kasturi Mrgas is in danger now. Civets are still available. I have seen both KASTURI and PUNUGU.  
There is lot of difference between their medicinal utility of both of them in the system of Ayurveda.  

With warm regards,
