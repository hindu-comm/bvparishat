Monier Williams:

  

CIVET, CIVET-CAT, s. gandhamārjāraḥ, gandhotuḥ m., khaṭṭāśaḥ -śī, pūtiśārijā,  

  

VS Apte :

  

Civet,-Cat, s. गंधमार्जारः.  

  

In spite of Indian and European Lexicographers' assertion of what they mean by the English word, if you feel it is not proper You can find yourself the accurate word from the classical or Vedic literature or coin a new word you feel accurate.
