कस्तूरिकाजननभृता मृगेण किं सेव्यते सुमनसां मनसापि गन्धः।

  

Here is the word कस्तूरीमृगः ---

  

कस्तूरी-मृग

  

(H3) कस्तूरी--मृग \[L=46893\] m. the musk-deer Comm. on Kum. i , 55.

  

Are both the same? 

  

The reference to the deer in the commentary on Kumarasambhava:

  

  

m.rganaabhigandhi - the commentary of Vallabhadeva =  

m.rgaa.naam+kastuurikaa***kura"ngaa.naam***  

  

Is the कस्तूरीमृग known as कुरङ्ग - deer or cat? called civet cat? Or are there two animals cat and deer that produce musk = कस्तूरी. Or the same, called as cat in English, and Deer in Sanskrit? This seems the base of the query though it is not mentioned explicitly.

  

This is what the English word means as per English Dictionary:

  

Cat-like mammal typically secreting musk used in perfumes  

civet cat  

  

Here is the Oxford Dictionary Entry for the English word civet:

  

civet

Pronunciation: /ˈsɪvɪt/

noun

(also civet cat)

***1a slender nocturnal carnivorous mammal with a barred and spotted coat and well-developed anal scent glands, native to Africa and Asia.***

Family Viverridae (the civet family): several genera and species. The civet family also includes the genets, linsang, and fossa, and formerly included the mongooses.

\[mass noun\] **a strong musky perfume obtained from the secretions of the civet’s scent glands.**

  

2US the ring-tailed cat or cacomistle.

Origin:

mid 16th century: from French civette, from Italian zibetto, from medieval Latin zibethum, from Arabic zabād, denoting the perfume

  

I think now it throws some light. 



Now, according English dictionaries, civet is native of Africa and Asia.

  

Now the question is the same sharpened: \\

  

Is it civet and कस्तूरी-मृग are both the same or two different animals and if different, both produce the scent or any confusion there?
