Thanks for the clarification of the doubt. So this sets the query at rest. Civet is correctly translated by the compilers translating the civet cat into Sanskrit and now the correct word for the civet cat, is to be picked up from Ayurvedic texts, as the are expected to name it and use the name in their works. Both Monier Williams and VS Apte have not given any reference to their usage in Sanskrit classical literature, probably they didn't have access to the technical medical literature in Ayurveda.  

  

So Kalidasa, had referred to the species of musk-deer मृगनाभिगन्धि and was correctly translated by the commentator. Now, the remaining for the tracing of Sanskrit Words for both, गन्धमार्ज्जारः, and कस्तूरिका-मृग in the medical literature so that the query would be completely solved.

  

There is no entry of both in the Sanskrit Dictionaries on a random search in MW though there isगन्धगज, there is no गन्ध-मार्ज्जारः

  

But शब्दकल्पद्रुम has the entry:

  

खट्टाश

  

\[L=9969\] \[p= 2-272\] खट्टाशः, पुं स्त्री, (खट्टः आत्मा वृतः सन् अश्नाति

इति । अश् अच् । अश्नुते व्याप्नोति गात्र-

गन्धेन वा । अशूङ् नव्याप्तौ अच् ।)

वनजन्तु-विशेषः । खटाश इति गन्धगोकुला इति च

भाषा । तत्पर्य्यायः ।

गन्धौतुः २ वनवासनः ३ ।

इति त्रिकाण्डशेषः ॥ खट्टाशी ४ वनाखुः ५ । इति

शब्दरत्नावली ॥ खट्टासः ६ गन्धमार्जारः ७

वनश्वा ८ शालिः ९ । इति जटाधरः ॥ पुष्य-

लकः १० । इति दुर्गादासधृतवचनम् ॥

  

Hope any of the synonyms would be found in medical literature.But those quoted above are all lexical literature. None from the classical literature also.
