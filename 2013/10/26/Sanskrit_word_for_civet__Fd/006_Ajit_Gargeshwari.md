Civet is not Musk deer anyway. According to wiki Civets have a broadly cat-like general appearance, though the muzzle is extended and often pointed, rather like that of an otter or a mongoose.

 Small Indian civets are known to occur in so one can probably get a sanskrit equvalent for Small Indian civet.

Sorry to quote wiki. I thought this might be useful.
