Namaste

  

मङ्गलं सुरभिर्देवी मङ्गलं वत्सवत्सला।  
मङ्गलं जगतां धात्री गोमाता नित्यमङ्गलम्॥

  

The second digital edition of the Śrīgosahasranāmastotram by Jagadguru Rāmānandācārya Svāmī Rāmabhadrācārya has been recently published by the Śrī Tulasī Pīṭha Sevā Nyāsa, Chitrakoot. The publication is now available for free download and online reading under [this link](http://jagadgururambhadracharya.org/works/sgsns/). A PDF copy is attached with this email.

  

Changes in the second edition include –

-   Some names were incorrect in the first edition due to scribal,
    typographic and editorial errors, including those arising from
    incorrect splitting of Sandhis. These errors have been corrected in
    the Stotram and the Nāmāvaliḥ, and their corresponding dative forms
    have been corrected in the Havanavidhiḥ. -   The benedictory and introductory verses have been added which were
    missing from the print edition (in the festschrift *Ṣaṣṭipūrti*
    Abhinandana Grantha, ISBN: 978-81-923856-0-0) and the first digital
    edition. -   Verse numbering for the Stotram has been corrected and it now begins
    with the first name (*Gauḥ*) of Śrīgomātā. The incorrect verse
    numbering (1 to 111) in the print edition and the first digital
    edition concealed the miraculous fact that the 1000 names are
    contained in exactly 108 verses. -   Running numbering of the names has been added on each line of the
    Stotram, with the numbers of the first and last names in the line. -   A new alphabetical index of the names (अकाराद्यनुक्रमनामावलिः) has
    been added to assist searching for a particular name. -   Typesetting is done in XeLaTeX using Sanskrit 2003 font. -   An HTML version is also available for online reading.

Work on the Gotoṣinī Samskrita commentary and the Jayā Hindi commentary on the Stotram is currently in progress and they will be included in the third edition of the publication.  

Thanks, Nityānanda Miśra
