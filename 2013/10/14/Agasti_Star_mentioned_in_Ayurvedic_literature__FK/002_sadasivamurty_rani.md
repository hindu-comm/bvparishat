This is a passage from my article "** IN DEFENCE OF JYOTIRVIJNAN**".  

"Another interesting account is connected with the rise of Agastya star. By the advent of this star that appears only once in a year after the rainy season all the watercourses, which are till that moment muddy become pure. This observation has a reference in many texts of Indian Jyotirvijnan-

*Udaye ca punaragastyanaamnaha kusamaayogamalpradushitaani,*

*Hridyaani sataamiva svabhaavaat punarambuni bhavanti nirmalaani.*

- **Brihatsamhita**

By the rise of star Agastya all the waters that have become muddy in the association of clay during rainy season will turn clear like the hearts of good people."

A Detailed account of Agastya Star is available in the Brhatsamita of Varahamihira.  

With warm regards to all.  

**Dr. Rani Sadasiva Murty**
