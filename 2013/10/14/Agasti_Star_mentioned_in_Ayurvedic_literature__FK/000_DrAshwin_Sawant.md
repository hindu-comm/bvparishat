अगस्त्योदये विषं मंदवीर्यं जलं च निर्विषं भवति.(चरकसंहिता;चिकित्सास्थान-अध्याय२३-सूत्र ८)  
  
This reference is from CharakSanhita,which states that Star called as 'Agasti' which is seen in the season known as 'Sharad' which is during months of Ashwin and Kaartik .  
Importance of this Agasti Star is that, its rays converts the impure water into pure water .And human beings are supposed to drink that water during Sharad-Rutu,to purify the body.  
Same reference is also found in Ashtanga-Sangraha and Ashtanga-Hriday ,which are written atleast a millenium after CharakSanhita,so
importance of Agasti was also felt after such a long period.Now my question is which star is this ,which is seen during these months?Can someone guide?Thanks.
