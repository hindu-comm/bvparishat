In Telugu literature produced in chaste and classic style we always use the phrase kRtajnatalu (thanks). Hardly we find the recently coined "dhanyavAdAlu", which is clearly imported from Hindi usage. vAlmIki uses kRitajnata for gratefulness. cf: dharmajnasca, kRtajnasca, satyavAkyo, dRDhavrataH. In my humble opinion, Sanskrit and Hindi scholars must make this usage popular and discourage the usage of dhanyavAda.
