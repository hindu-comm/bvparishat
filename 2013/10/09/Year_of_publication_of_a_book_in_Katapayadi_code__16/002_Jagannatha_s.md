Dear Shankara,



This is ofsankhyaa-suuchakapadas mixed with exact terms of numbers. This is not of KATAPAYAADI.

raama=3 (Srirama, Balarama and Parashuraama)

ashta=8

sapta=7

indu=1

By the application of the rule \`\`ankaanaam vaamato gatih''

we will get the shaka year 1783.

  
There is 78 years of difference in between cristian era and shaka.



So we have to add 78 to 1783.

Total= 1861

This is the date of publication.
