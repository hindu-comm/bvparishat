sir,

In Purushasuktha 9th mantra it is mentioned that Chhandas was born from the Purusha .MaxMuller in his Chips from a German workshop vol 1 Page 84

says that Zend was originally a corruption of the sanskrit word Chhanda.If Purushasuktha indeed presupposes the existence of Zend

avesta the chronology of aryan movement will be greatly affected.Kindly let me know whether any discussion/debate on the lines

have been held and if so what is the finalconsensus.
