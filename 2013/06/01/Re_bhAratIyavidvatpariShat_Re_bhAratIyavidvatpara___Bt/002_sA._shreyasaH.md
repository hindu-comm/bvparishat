नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

Dear Dr. Bhat and scholars,

  

Please see the attached discussion on "नतस्य प्रतिमा अस्ति" wrt स्वर-प्रक्रिया extracted from the text "वैदिक-स्वर-मीमांसा" by Pandit Yudhistar Meemansak.

  

Though the author does not explicitly state that here, it appears that he has applied अनुदात्तम पदमेकवर्जम (६-१-१५८), to show that "नतस्य"
has to be split into two padams - "न + तस्य" (as both न् and त् are उदात्तम्) , thereby leading to the choice of one possible interpretation over the the other (unsatisfactory) alternative.

  

Can you please comment on Pandit Yudhistar's explanation ?

  

Regards,

-Shreyas
