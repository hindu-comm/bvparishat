Shankar is right. Many words of Sanskrit could easily misquoted and misinterpreted by eloquent orators to support their statements like this.

  

### a Tasya Pratima Asti - what it means

Yajur Veda 32.3: Na Tasya Pratima Asti  
As we all know, one shloka of from this important sukta 32.3 "Na Tasya Pratima Asti" is highly misqouted by anti Hindu and evil people like Jakir Naik.  
Though everybody knows people like Jakir Naik are giving example of their evil deeds, they have no affinity with Vedas but only purpose is to fool Hindus and even muslims. Such lies has been exposed many a times.  
This post provides the proper explanation. Please must read and share as much as possible.

This is from one of the searched pages. I have not checked the source personallyh.

  

It is very popular statement that there is no equal to him who acquires great fame. Here also it applies mutatis mutandis to every speakers misquoting Vedic sentences making people believe what they say because of their popularity and the ignorance of the common people with with the knowledge of some Saskrit words out of the original context, which they are familiar.

  

I don't want to enter into such a discussion unless it is started with well intention of knowing the correct meaning of the Vedic verses.
