The more relevant question is whether प्रतिमा in this verse stands for प्रतिनिधि/मूर्ति (as the Arya Samajis and Pt. Yudhishthir Mimamsaka interpret) or प्रतिमान/सादृश्य (as most of the other commentators interpret).  
  
And if taken as मूर्ति here, then what about other Vedic verses in संहिताs like कासीत्प्रमा प्रतिमा किं निदानं (ऋग्वेद १०-१३०-३), सहस्रस्य प्रतिमासि (यजुर्वेद १५-६५), संवत्सरस्य प्रतिमां यां त्वा रात्र्युपास्महे (अथर्ववेद ३-१०-३), et cetera? And we are not going into आरण्यक, ब्राह्मण and उपनिषद् even though the traditional position is मन्त्रब्राह्मणयोर्वेदनामधेयम् (आ.श्रौ. २४-१-३१), since Swami Dayananda and Arya Samajis take only मन्त्र (संहिता) part as वेद.  
  
If one श्रुति says no प्रतिमा, other श्रुतिs talk about प्रतिमा of अग्नि and even उपासना of रात्रि which is प्रतिमा of संवत्सर, then प्रतिमा has to be interpreted very carefully.  
  
The Arya viewpoint has been answered in detail by Jwalaprasad Mishra in दयानन्दतिमिरभास्करः, 1920, Khemraj Shrikrishnadass, 4th edition, pages 350 to 407.
