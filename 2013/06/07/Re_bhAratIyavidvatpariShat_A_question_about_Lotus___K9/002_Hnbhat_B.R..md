For me it seems a complete comparison between the knowledge earned by learning books (bookish knowledge limited to the books one has learnt) like the water lily's growth is limited by the level of the water. There is nothing to infer in the "upamana" than the comparison between the two, the limitation of the extent of the growth of water lily and tbe bookish knowledge. (i.e. book = water; growth = aLavu - limit; lily = the bookish learner.
