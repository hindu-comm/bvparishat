I think 'unwinding of the stem' by the lotus while the water level  
increases,is compared to difficult times while the mind of a truly  
great man finds out it's stored merits to meet the  
contingency.'Limitation of bookish knowledge' i feel,doesn't come in  
to the picture,unless of course if it's not warranted by any previous  
Kural verse.  
Another aspect that comes to mind is that a lotus stalk is limited and  
it can't unwind beyond that.This happens heavy rains when the lotuses  
are submerged in the overflooding water and perish.  
In Odia language there is an addage in navaaksharee verse : " je  
pakhee uDe jete dUra / se jaaNe tahinra khabara // " This means a bird  
knows as much as can it soar high on it's wings.Here 'knowledge' is  
proportionate to the bird's soaring high on it's wings,just like in  
the Kural verse the length of the lotus-stem is proportionate to the  
rise of the lotus on water to blossom.The level of water and the  
length of the stem put a limit to the rise of the lotus,so also the  
limited strength of the bird's wings cause a limitation to the bird's  
resultant height and knowledge thereby.  
The rise of a lotus and so also the stable-mindedness of a great man  
may have limitations beyond a certain point.A lotus may perish with  
too much water and a true great man may fall in to bad days and  
collapse !
