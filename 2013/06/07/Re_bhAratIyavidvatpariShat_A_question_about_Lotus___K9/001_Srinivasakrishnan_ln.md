Thanks, Dr Mishra, for your comments. Appreciate your verse too.

  

My earlier presentation might have been a little confusing. Let me try and make amends.

  

In this kuṛaḷ verse re the lotus flower and another nīti verse not in the kuṛaḷ (taught to elementary school kids) re water lily, the metaphor seems to be about the one who looks, not about the object that is being looked at. At least that's my understanding. It says the flower that you see has more to it than you think. If the water is high you see it higher. If the water is lower, you see it lower.

  

The other verse says 'as the water lily is at water level, so the analytical faculties of a person which are at the level of the texts (grantha's) he has studied. I reproduce the verse in Tamil script for those who may know Tamil:

  

நீரளவே ஆகுமாம் நீராம்பல் தான் கற்ற நூலளவே ஆகுமாம் நுண்ணறிவு

  

In both cases, it does not appear to be about the greatness of the lotus or the water lily. On the other hand, the metaphor seems to speak to the limitation of the looker who sees it as high or low. The water level being a metaphor for limitation of perception.
