Dear Sri Srinivasakrishnan,  
  
Let me offer an AryA translation of the Tirukkural statement to convey  
the idea somewhat better as I see it :  
  
jalasamplave naalo hi kamalam unnineeshati vimucyamaanaH /  
meeyate 'pi manasvinaam sanmaano maanasenaiva //  
  
Such metaphorical use of a lotus may be there in Sanskrit  
literature.The implication here seems more to speak about the  
plasticity and forbearance of the great minds than 'limitation of  
man's understanding' as you have supposed.  
Warm regards,  
SMMishra
