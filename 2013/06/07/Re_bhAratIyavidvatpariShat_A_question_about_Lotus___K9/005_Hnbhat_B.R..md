Excuse me. I was referring to the other verse seemingly parallel to the comparison of lotus in the kural, quoted in the subsequent message

  

The other verse says 'as the waterlilyis at water level, so the analytical faculties of a person which are at the level of the texts (grantha's) he has studied. I reproduce the verse in Tamil script for those who may know Tamil:

  

நீரளவே ஆகுமாம் நீராம்பல் தான் கற்ற நூலளவே ஆகுமாம் நுண்ணறிவு

  

In both cases, it does not appear to be about the greatness of the lotus or the waterlily. On the other hand, the metaphor seems to speak to the limitation of the looker who sees it as high or low. The water level being a metaphor for limitation of perception.

  

which says clearly refers to the bookish knowledge limited to the book. nool = book, alavu - measurement, noonnarivu - the knowledge acquired from the book, taan = one, katra = has learnt.

  

In the kural quoted also, there is not any specific reference to lotus, but only length of the flower*வெள்ளத் தனைய* *மலர்நீட்டம்* *malar = flower, nITTam = length (which has been rightly translated by the earlier translator who knew Tamil as native language as प्रसूननाल)* which has been taken by the Tamil retaken as neeraambal - lily (water lily) in the other one.

  

This is what I suggested. It is purely अर्थान्तरन्यास between the two statements. In the kural, the second statement clearly refers to the height uyarvu = height, which has been differently interpreted by the two. In Sanskrit translation, it has been literally translated as उत्साह and in the Tamil translation, it has been interpreted as the extent of knowledge acquired from the book noonrarivu.

  

Now you can translate of your own.
