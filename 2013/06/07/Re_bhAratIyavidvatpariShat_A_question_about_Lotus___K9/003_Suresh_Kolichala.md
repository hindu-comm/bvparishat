LNS: I am not sure about your interpretation. I have seen several translations,but no one seems to allude to the onlooker. Below is the Telugu translation of Kural 595 byMudiganti Jaganna Sastri:

  

![Inline image 1](https://groups.google.com/group/bvparishat/attach/973c92eccef073ae/kural_595.png?part=0.1)  

(As the luster of a lily depends on the level of water,

so does the fortune of a man on his energy levels)

  

I think this translation fits well with 593 and 594.
