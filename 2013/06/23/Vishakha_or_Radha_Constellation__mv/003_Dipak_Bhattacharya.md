Rādhā may be an after-thought aiming at making its name tally with the name of the following star. But *anurādha* means ‘favorable to success’ not ‘after *rādhā*’. One finds such invention based on erroneous folk-etymology in *umādhava* (supposedly ‘Umā’s husband’) invented to tally with *mādhava* supposedly ‘Mā’s husband’. *Mādhava* is derived from *madhu*.
