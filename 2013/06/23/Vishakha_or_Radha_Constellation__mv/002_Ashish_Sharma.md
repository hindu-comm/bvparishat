Thanks for the reply but still not satisfied with the reason.

If Vishakha and raadhaa means kaanti then their can be more synonyms too for vishaakha. Even kaanti can be a synonym. I think that their should be more reasons behind calling vishakha as radha. You can also see that after vishakha nakshatra, anuradha nakshatra comes hence interpretation should be beyond our reply.

  

Please help me with your valuable feedback.
