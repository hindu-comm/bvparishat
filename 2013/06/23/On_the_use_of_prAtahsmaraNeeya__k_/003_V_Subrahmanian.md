Sir,  
  
Here is one instance in print and others in oral deliveries by the Jagadguru of Sringeri in public speeches where this particular expression was used, of course, in respect of a departed soul. In the foreword to the book on the 'VivekachUDAmaNiH' with the commentary of HH Sri Chandrashekhara Bharati SwaminaH (who lived up to 1954) of Sringeri, published by a Trust attached to the Sringeri Peetham, in 1982, the then Jagadguru HH Sri AbhinavavidyAtIrtha SwaminaH wrote:  
  
श्रीचन्द्रशेखरभारतीतिप्रथितप्रातःस्मरणीयनामधेयाः अस्मदाचार्यपादाः कृततपश्चर्याः सर्वतन्त्रस्वतन्त्राः शास्त्रोपदिष्टार्थानुष्ठाननिष्ठगरिष्ठाः अपरोक्षीकृतात्मतत्त्वाः जीवन्मुक्ता अभूवन्नित्येतदेव व्याख्यायाः  
उत्कर्षबोधनायालम् ।  
  
Even I recalled the stotram/s that you have cited. What about 'pancha kanyAH samarEnnityam'? These are also departed individuals. I think smaraNam is of someone who has departed, though for an ardent disciple/devotee his Guru or any other person who has tremendous influence on him, even though alive, is prAtasmaraNIyaH.
