Both these usages do not denote they are departed immortals, but considered as holy names to be remembered in both cases.

  

Any other शिष्टप्रयोग will do. In the first it is current usage used in respect of departed. In the second, it is nothing more than deifying them.

  

That is the last part of my message, extending the usage to living mortals considering them as immortals.
