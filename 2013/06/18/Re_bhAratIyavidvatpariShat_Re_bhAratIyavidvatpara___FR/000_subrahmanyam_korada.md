नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

Vidvan Sunil Bhatacarya has quoted the popular verse and there is no doubt Gandhari had had Krishnabhakti .

  

There cannot be बाधा to शिवभक्ति from her कृष्णभक्ति ।

  

On the other hand , I was not satisfied with my interpretation - the verse has some defects - since the member said he was waiting still , an attempt is made .

  

Let us leave it there .

  

रिपुरेव गर्भः(भ्रूणः) or something like that --

  

गर्भिणी भार्या यस्य सः गर्भिभार्यः - स्त्रियाः पुंवत् इति पुंवद्भावः । ननु स्त्रियाम् अनवयवभूतः गर्भसंबन्धः प्रवृत्तिनिमित्तम् । पुंसि तु अवयवभूतगर्भसंबन्धः यथा गर्भी व्रीहिरिति , तेन समानायाम् आकृतौ भाषितपुंस्कत्वात् कथं पुंवद्भावः ?

  

नैष दोषः । अन्तर्वस्तुसंबन्धमात्रस्येह प्रवृत्तिनिमित्तत्वात् । (मधवीयधातुवृत्तिः-गॄ तुदादि)

  

धन्यो’स्मि
