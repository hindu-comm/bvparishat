The दर्शनोपनिषत् is a medieval Upanishad. It is unscientific to assign to it the same authority as to the major Upanishads commented upon by Shankara. Even Shankara who made a commentary on the Maanduukya did not regard it as sruti but just mentioned it as a prakarana. The Vishishtaadvaitas too seem to regard the Maanduukya just as a smriti not a sruti. It is necessary not to get swayed by the name Upanishad popularly tagged to a late text and then cite that as a Vedic authority without applying the necessary discretion. That creates a wrong idea about the Vedas.
