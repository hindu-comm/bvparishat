Respected Scholars,

Namaste.

I am working on the text Sivamritasarasamuccaya/Saivamritasarasamuccaya of Shreeshadeva of Gauda. Introducing himself the author has mentioned a verse at the beginning of the text, which reads:*rājye gauḍamahībhujāṁ saḥ bhavat kośādhikārī paraḥ, prātrāṇāṁ budhadeva ityupacito bhūlokakalpadrumaḥ\| tasmād gautama vāmadevatanayo lebhe padaṁ paitryakaṁ, jajñe bhūtanirandhakaḥ śivaparaḥ śrīśobhidevastataḥ\|\|3\|\|.*And, to my understanding, the meaning of the verse is -‘in the kingdom of the Gauḍa king he, i. e. Budhadeva, was the chief treasurer who was endowed with all good qualities and was a ‘all fulfilling tree’ in this earth; then comes Gautama, the son of Vāmadeva, who occupies the post of his father; and you all should know Śrīśadeva, the enlightener of all creatures and a devotee of Siva, as the next’. Thus, could anyone provide me some more clues about the identification of this author of Gauda, i.e. West Bengal.

Thanks in advance.
