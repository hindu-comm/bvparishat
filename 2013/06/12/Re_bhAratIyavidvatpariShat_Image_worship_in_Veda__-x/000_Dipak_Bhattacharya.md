Accepted tradition is a vague term. The MuktikaUpanishad itself is post-Vedic. See Radhakrishnan/Deussen/R.E.Hume for the distinction between the earlier major and later minor upanishads. Any standard book on the history of Vedic literature will do.

I think such a statement appears to contradict quite a few accepted traditions.  
  
Firstly the Darshana Upanishad is one of the 108 canonical upanishads, listed in the Muktika upanishad, which also lists the ten major Upanishads.  
  
Secondly the Darshana Upanishad belongs to the Sama veda. Has anybody carried out any research and fimrly established which are the authentic Upanishads in the Sama veda and which are the spurious ones, if there are any?  
  

Thirdly the Upanishads and the Aranyakas constitute the Vedanta whereas the Samhitas and Brahmanas constitute the Veda, if we accept Sayana's classification. From the Mundaka Upanishad we know that the Vedanta teaches the Para (obviously means the higher) Vidya whereas the Vedas teach the Apara Vidya. Further the Bhagavad Gita also calls the Vedas as Traigunyavishayaa. That is why it appears that the same status should be accorded to both the Vedas and the Upanishads, if not higher status to the Upanishads.  
  

Fourthly the Smritis do not deserve the same status as the Veda as it is given that when there is conflict between the views of Smriti and that of the Veda one should accept what is said in the Veda.
