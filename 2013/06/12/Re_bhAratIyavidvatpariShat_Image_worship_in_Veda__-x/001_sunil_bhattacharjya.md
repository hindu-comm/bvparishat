I agree that all the Upanishads could not have been written at the same time, particularly when the Chandogya Upanishad has mentioned Devaki-putra. However the following questions arise:  
  
(i) Has anybody established the order of antiquity of the Upanishads and if so on what basis?  
  
(ii) Has anybody done any linguistic study on the different Upanishads to trace their antiquities.  
  
It appears that the western scholars could not even understand the text of the Darshana Upanishad properly. Eminent Sanskrit scholar Prof. Jean Varenne could not translate the end portions of the 6th chapter of the Darshana upanishad and said that the final stanzas of this khanda are too corrupt for adequate translation. When he came to the end stanzas of the 7th chapter he wrote "Again there are a number of very corrupt stanzas". Such sweeping unsubstantiated statements are unbecoming of any reputed scholar.
