Please go through my reply. I gave the names of three well-known authors. These are so well discussed matter that repeating them about hundred years or more after they had been adduced might look unnecessary to scholars. I add the names of Winternitz and Macdonell. But unlike those by Deussen, Hume or Radhakrishnan their accounts are of popular nature.
