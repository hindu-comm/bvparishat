Anyhow the purpose of quoting the verse in तत्त्वबोधिनी is quite clear, to give the literal meaning of the suffix in the term कर्मप्रवचनीय as कर्म प्रोक्तवन्तः as अन्वर्थसंज्ञा by the suffix अनीयर्. which shows once these were used to denote the action कर्म = क्रिया and not now presently used to denote only the relation of them with other words. generally has been used कर्मणि or भावे here as per 3-4-70 तयोरेव कृत्यक्तखलर्थाः and here it is used in कर्तरि as a special case to get the above meaning in the past tense. To defend this contention, he quotes the कारिका from वाक्यपदीय and has commented it in full.
