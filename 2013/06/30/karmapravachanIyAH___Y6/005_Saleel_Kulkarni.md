Respected Sir,

  

Thank you very much for your reply.  

  

{{Have you read any explanations already? If so, please let us know which ones.}}

  

I first checked with Abhyankar's dictionary of Sanskrit grammar and Apte's guide to Sanskrit composition. They have briefly explained the term Karmapravachaniya. But that explanation is too elementary.  

  

I also read the Kashika and the Mahabhashya, as also the Tattvabodhini commentary that I had included in my query. TB seems to have extrapolated and elaborated on the Mahabhashya. I understood the general meaning of the TB commentary, but I still do not feel satisfied that I have got the essence.

  

Where can I get Ram Nath Sharma's book? (All the volumes?)

  

Thanks.

  

Saleel Kulkarni
