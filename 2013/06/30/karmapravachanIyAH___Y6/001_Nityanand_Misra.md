Have you read any explanations already? If so, please let us know which ones.  
  
The Sutra, the VP verse, and the Mahabhashya on the Sutra (from which the Tattvabodhini gloss draws) are explained lucidly in English by Ram Nath Sharma. I suggest you read the commentary and if you sill have doubts, ask specific questions (e.g. what is द्योतक of क्रिया) since the scope of this topic is very wide.
