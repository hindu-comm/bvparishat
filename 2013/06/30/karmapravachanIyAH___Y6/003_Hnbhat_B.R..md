Rightly said by Mr. Nityananda. Otherwise, the तत्त्वबोधिनी commentary itself is clearly explaining the वाक्यपदीयकारिका he has quoted and if you have to know more, you may have to refer to the Helaraja's commentary and the commentary of RN Sharma also on AS.

  

Please ask any specific question if you have got any doubt in the application of the rule or the interpretation. Otherwise it would be too much to expect for a message box in the mail list.
