In that matter we are helpless. As Sri Nityananda has given the link, the Ashtadhyayi can be downloaded at your own risk.

  

And for Helaraja's commentary on Vakyapadiya also there are several Editions with commentary, one with Ambakartri commentary and Helaraja's commentary and translations:

Here is one with an English translation and notes and the critically edited text of Vakyapadiya:

  

<http://archive.org/download/Vakyapadiya/vakyapadiya.pdf>  

  

which can be downloaded freely, but care for. this contains General Index and Verse Index too.

and history of edition of Vakyapadiya.

  

Here is the list of Editions of Vakyapadiya from Google Book Search I got:
