Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



Please correct me if my account is wrong.



Krishna's son Pradyumna was killed in front of his eyes during internal fight among Yadavas as the curse of Gaandhari and curse received by Saamba started manifesting. Many Yadavas killed each other after drinking heavily. Krishna got disgusted and left.



Message was sent to Hastinapur to Arjun to come rescue wives and relatives of Krishna. Arjun could not defend wives of Krishna in front of attack by Aabhiras. Some of the wives were abducted by Aabhiras. In the known history during the period 300 BC to 300 AD there were Aabhiras in the Gujarat side of the subcontinent. Now the story of Krishna is 3000 year old. Were there Aabhiras in the western India even at the time of Krishna and his Dvaraka? How come so powerful Pandavas could not control Aabhiras when they were in power in Hastinapur assuming that due to Kaala Mahimaa, Arjun lost his power to fight with Aabhiras and protect all wives of Krishna. I need true information and not glorified version of all powerful Arjun. Thanks. N.R.Joshi
