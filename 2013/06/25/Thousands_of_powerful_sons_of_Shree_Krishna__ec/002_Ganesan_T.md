From this account of the Mahabharata, it becomes certain that the text's main intention is to portray Krishna well as a human being (possessing at the same time great divine powers, which, as we know from the Anushaasana Parva, were granted to him by God Siva upon Krishna's intense devotion to Siva and his severe penance by taking the Pasupatavrata under the guidance of sage Upamnyu)  
  

The actual text of the Anushaasana Parva is the following where Krishna himself narrates, as a first person account in the presence of Bhishma, Yudhishthira and others, the penance he undertook and the blessings he received from Siva:  
  

मूर्ध्ना निपत्य नियतस्तेजःसंनिचये ततः।

परमं हर्षमागम्य भगवन्तमथाब्रुवम्॥

धर्मे दृढत्वं युधि शत्रुघातं

यशस्तथाग्र्यं परमं बलं च।

योगप्रियत्वं तव संनिकर्षं

वृणे सुतानां च शतं शतानि॥

  

At the end of this narration Krishna recounts the 1000 names of Siva(Sivasahasranaama) that was taught to him by Upamanyu.  
Mahabharata also narrates, as noted by Sri. Joshi, how Krishna, true to his human birth, became disgusted with the family events and finally got hit by an arrow of a hunter.
