Dear Learned Scholars and Guruvars

  

Pranaam

  

As per my Gurus order, I am here mentioning how I got this shloka.

2 years back, I read this shloka in 1 book written by Shri Atharvan Satyajeet Dubey and he had used this shloka in some astrological interpretation and also wrote that its from Mahabharata. After an year, Sri PR Ramamurthy had posted this shloka in his forum which our gurus have already and posted here.

I had a talk with him and he too confirmed that its from Anusmriti from mahabharata. Yesterday i sent a mail to him to get about edition detail and so I am here pasting his reply for you all-

"Dear Sharmaji,

  

 I had the 14th Edition , (सं० २०४१ चौदह्‍वाँ संस्करण) ( corresponding to Christian Era 1984 AD, I guess). The sloka quoted above appears in 'Anusmriti' which is one of the five jewels of Mahabharata, the other four being Bhagavadgita, Vishnu Sahasranama, Bhishma Stavaraja and Gajendra moksha. The above is the 31st sloka in Anusmriti and it appears on page 171 of 'Pancharatna Gita, 14th Edition"

  

I hope I have given the details you wanted from me.

  

With good wishes,

  

PRR "
