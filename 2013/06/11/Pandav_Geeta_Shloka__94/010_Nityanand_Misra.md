When we have not seen every interpretation of this verse, how can we say that every interpretation with violate the Nyaya. If one has the Anvaya wherein there is no association between ripu in the first half and ripugarbha in the second half, an interpretation based on such Anvaya would not have this violation. With all the possible meanings of garbha and ripu (Ripu is also the name of Yadu's son), such an Anvaya and interpretation is very much possible.

  

It's a tricky verse to say the least. It would be worth exploring the precise published source and variant readings (if any) of the verse. Is this from Pandava Gita or Anusmriti (or both, if the two are not the same)? I could not trace this verse to a published source on the Internet - an unrealiable website ascribed this to Anusmriti, which as per some other sources is not found in some editions of Mahabharata.
Unless traced to a reliable published source, there is always the possibility of the actual reading being different (as turned out to be the case with कुधर्म तत् in a verse cited by Sharma Ji which was actually कुवर्त्म तत्).

  

If a commentary or gloss is available in the published source which makes the Anvaya clear, it would help our understanding.

I also thought of this as a possible variant reading. Which is why would be good to know the precise source(s) and reading(s).
