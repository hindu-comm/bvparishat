नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

Thank you for the correction Dr Misra .

  

Naturally , it should be गान्धारी and not कुन्ती ।

  

Overtaxing the mind sometimes leads one into oblivion .

  

Vidvan Ashish Sharma -

  

I kept in mind the context - पाण्डवगीताश्लोकः । Therefore any interpretation should be nearer to Pandavas and co and one should be in a position to defend with authority , i.e. Veda , Vedangas , Itihasa etc.

  

Usage of certain words , which are not popular , also plays an important role in such cases .

  

The word प्रमाणम् is used by Bhartrhari in Padakanda of Vakyapadiyam in the sense of हिंसा ( मीङ् हिंसायाम्) ।

  

धन्यो’स्मि
