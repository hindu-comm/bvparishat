Namaste,  
  
It is more likely that this sloka is part of 'Anusmriti'. In the beginning of this discussion, Ashish Sharma clearly mentions that this sloka is from Anusmriti. I wonder how 'pandava geeta' entered in the name of this thread.  
  
Anusmriti available online at the following blog contains the sloka beginning with 'samigarbhascha'.  
<http://prramamurthy1931.blogspot.in/2012/04/anusmriti-anumriti-is-considered-asone.html>  
  
Gita Press edition of Mahabharata has Anusmriti in chapter 209 in Santi Parva - Page 4958. It can be read online at  
<http://archive.org/details/mahabharat05ramauoft>  

But, I could not find this particular sloka (beginning with Samigarbhascha) in that chapter, though there are a few slokas ending with 'sa me vishnu prasidatu' in Narada's stuti which follows anusmriti. Giving below one such verse which needs scholarly interpretation.  

  
चतुर्भिश्च चतुर्भिश्च द्वाभ्यां पञ्चभिरेव च।  
हूयते च पुनर्द्वाभ्यां स मे विष्णुः प्रसिदतु॥  
  
Mahabharata based on south Indian texts, contains Anusmriti in chapter 210, Santi Parva, page 335. The sloka beginning with 'samigarbhascha...' is not found there. Chitrasala edition of Mahabharata also has a chapter on anusmriti (chapter 209), but this sloka is absent there too.

shankara
