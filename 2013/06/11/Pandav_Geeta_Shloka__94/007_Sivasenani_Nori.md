Sri Mishra has raisedan interestingpoint. I believethat if we follow the path pointed out by him, every interpretation of the verse would besimilarly defective. Let me explain.



In the second pAda, we have: तस्य गर्भस्य यो रिपुः, that is "\[he\] who is the enemy of the son of VAyu". This "he" we agree is Duryodhana. The यत् used in this pAda expects a तत् later, otherwise the construct "\[he\] who is the enemy of" is unnecessary. We will ignore this loose end for the time being.Now, the next pAda reads रिपुगर्भस्य यो गर्भः. Here if the word रिपुगर्भस्य is to be understood as दुर्योधनगर्भस्य, then we interpret "ripu" as "the enemy of Bhima", that is रिपुगर्भस्य अर्थात् भीमसेनरिपुगर्भस्य - and the last word attracts the same nyAya - सापेक्षमसमर्थम्। Even if we change it to भीमसेनस्य रिपुगर्भस्य, the defect will remain. On this interpretation, we have the additional defect that the expectancy of यत् in second pAda has not been satisifed.



Now, if we revisit the loose end "\[he\] who is the enemy of Bhimasena", we would be justified in bringing in a तत् (अध्याहरः) and write it out as तस्य रिपुगर्भस्य; but, then this falls foul of the same nyAya - सापेक्षमसमर्थम्।



Since the problem lies with the word रिपुगर्भस्य,one way out would be to write it as रिपोः गर्भस्य (this will pose new problems in interpreting the word "garbhasya" - but that is another matter).



Or, if we take "ripu" to be a सम्बन्धिशब्दः like guru, pitr, dAsa etc., we have a way out. Vakyapadiyam 3.11.47 reads:



सम्बन्धिशब्दः सापेक्षो नित्यं सर्वः प्रयुज्यते।

स्वार्थवत्सा व्यपेक्षास्य वृत्तावपि न हीयते ॥ 47, VrittisamuddeSa ॥



Helaraja's "PrakASa" reads thus: इह केचिच्छब्दाः स्वार्थमितरापेक्षं नान्तरीयकमभिदधानाः सम्बन्धिशब्दाः कथ्यन्ते। तद्यथा - गुरुशिष्यपितृपुत्रमातृभ्रात्रादयः।



One wonders, though, that if we start including words like "enemy" in this list, it would really become sobig, as to put a question mark on the application ofसमर्थः पदविधिः।

"I too agree with Shri Nityanand Misra jee that if the interpretation will come without any violation and also that interpretation should be acceptable to all masses as our reply create a foundation of the shloka meaning."



\- If we really look at all doshas listed- say as given in the 7th chapter of Kavyaprakasa - verses like this would have to be termed defective. The underlying principle is that describing Vishnu in such a roundabout way is devoid of what Anandavardhana would say "cArutvotkarsha". One story goes that Sri Harsha, the author of NaishadhIyacaritam, was related (as a nephew) to MammaTAcArya (author of Kavyaprakasa) and that MammaTa upon examining Naishadham exclaimed that he should have perused the mahAkAvyam before compiling his doshaprakaraNa, for he would not have had to go to such lengths to find examples (of verses with doshas)! Then we have so many Slokas with onlySabdAla\~NkAras and citrakavitva (both Bharavi and Magha dedicated one chapter in their mahakavyas to compose such poetry, including a verse each using only one letter), which the poeticians categorise as third-rate poetry. Then, Anandavardhana labelled Kalidasa's description of the cosummation of the marriage of Siva and Parvati in Kumarsambhava as "anucita" (they are the parents of the world, and since it is inappropriate to describe such acts of uttama prakriti characters like kings, and of our own parents, that description is "anucita", inappropriate). If our Mahakavis have been so criticised by Alaankaarikas, one can imagine the criticism possible in case of other Slokas.



Hence, a mature approach would be to look at an interpretation which is"reasonably agreeable to scholars" and not add the filter of "dosharahita".



Finally, one disclaimer. I mentioned the above doshas of Mahakavis stated by Alaankaarikas only to give a strong counter-example. Samudaacaara is toignore such aspects and focus on the positives and celebrate their genius. In a way, this practice is what has led to unreasonable expectations of perfection. Alaankaariakas are also poets in our tradition and those great men learned in VyaakaraNa, MImaamsaa and Nyaaya had the courage to criticise the Mahakavis (ordinary mortals like yours truly should not do so independently), but they hold them in very high regard. For instance, Anandavardhana,notwithstanding the criticism of Kalidasa, holds him in the highest regard - संसारे कालिदासप्रभृतयो द्वित्राः पञ्चषा वा महाकवय इति गण्यन्ते (Dhvan. Vritti on 1.6). My point is that we should strive to absorb the good, and not be caught in the rut of identifying the not-so-good. Bar Srimannarayana, there is no defect-free entity in this world.
