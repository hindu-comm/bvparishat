Namaste,  
  

I have one query on it. You said as follows:

I find it difficult to accept that गान्धारी who is known for pronouncing a शाप on कृष्ण can be considered as somebody who remembers कृष्ण (सा तं स्मरतीति भावः).

How can you say like this about one of the greatest women of all time. She never blessed her own children to win against Dharma as she always wished the Dharma (Righteousness) to win. It was only towards the end of the war when Duryodhana went to take her blessings she wanted to save his life by making him invincible, but never blessed him to be able to kill Bhima. Her curse to Lord Krishna shows her disappointment at Lord Krishna's not finding a way to avoid the war, as according to her nothing is impossible for the Lord.  
  

In assessing Gandhari we have to remember what she said;  

गान्धारी उवाच :  
त्वमे व माता च पिता त्वमे व  
त्वमे व बन्धुश्च सखा त्वमे व /  
त्वमे व विद्या द्रविणं त्वमे व  
त्वमे व सर्वं मम दे व दे व // 27

Gandhari said :  

Of my Lord of Lords, you alone are my mother and you alone are my father,

You alone are my relations, you alone are my friend,

You alone are my knowledge, you alone are my wealth,

You alone are everything for me.

In mahabharata Vedavyasa says that the Lord could have annulled tyhe curse of gandhari but he willingly allowed to bear fruit and that shows how much respect and love the Lord had for her.  
  

My point is that about nearness to the Lord, please consider Gandhari as not any different from Kunti, if not nearer.
