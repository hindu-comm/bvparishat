Dr. Murty, Many thanks for tracing this. I would like to read the context and gloss (if any).

  

Can you please share the Prakarana and Vishaya, along with the edition of Subhashitaratnabhandagara you are referring.

  

I refer the publication by Nirnay Sagar Press (1952) available at <http://archive.org/stream/SubhashitaRatnaBhandagara/> which likely has different page and verse numbers.
