Pranams to all Scholars.  
I too couldn't find this in Anugita. I don't have the Pandava Geetha text with me.  
I gave my interpretation of this sloka from my memory as I learned this sloka while I was studying MA in Sanskrit during 1978-'80.  
  
While this discussion is in progress here in this forum and after posting my sloka here, curiously I searched in the Subhashita Ratnabhandagara where I could trace out this sloka on page 195 with sloka no. 26. There also I could see the same way of interpretation as I have posted here. This information may be of some use in this context.  
With regards,  

**Dr. Rani Sadasiva Murty**
