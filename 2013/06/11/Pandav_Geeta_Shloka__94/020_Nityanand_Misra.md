Well no doubt that Gandhari is one of the inspiring characters of the Mahabharata, who was aware that Krishna is Paramatman himself. However, if at all Gandhari is known for being a devotee, she is known as a devotee of Shiva (Adi Parva of MBh) and not Krishna or Vishnu (unless one uses the argument that Shiva and Vishnu are one). Contrast this with Kunti who desires for the Darshana of Krishna again and again as Vyasa says in Bhagavatam -

  

विपदः सन्तु नः शश्वत्तत्र तत्र जगद्गुरो।

भवतो दर्शनं यत्स्यादपुनर्भवदर्शनम॥ Srimadbhagavatam 1-8-25

  

The reading Dr. Korada had is different so he may want to clarify his opinion on whether Gandhari can be considered as a devotee of Krishna/Vishnu.

  

Another issue I have with this interpretation is that if रिपु is taken as Duryodhana, then what Samaasa is to be understood in रिपुगर्भ to mean Gandhari. If it is बहुव्रीहि (रिपुः दुर्योधनः गर्भः पुत्त्रः यस्याः सा) then it should be in feminine gender, whereas रिपुगर्भस्य is masculine/neuter. If it is षष्ठीतत्पुरुष (रिपोः दुर्योधनस्य गर्भः) then which meaning of गर्भ is to be understood to imply mother? This question does not arise if रिपु is taken as water and रिपुगर्भ as लक्ष्मी - there it is षष्ठीतत्पुरुष (रिपोः जलस्य गर्भः) and गर्भ is to be understood as "that which is inside", as लक्ष्मी was born from सागरमथन.
