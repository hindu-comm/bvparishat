I do not know which mantras are exactly uttered in the Parjanya Homa.  
But the oldest reference to a ritual praying to Brhaspati and  
invoking Parjanya for Rainfall is found in RV (10.98). This was  
carried out by Devaapi for his younger brother Shantanu when there was  
a 12 year drought in his country (Kurudesha). Yaska and Brhaddevata  
explain this further. Of course the story is found in MBh, and several  
puraNas with variations. I am interested in knowing from your brother  
whether any of the hymns of RV are used in the present day Parjanya  
Homa.
