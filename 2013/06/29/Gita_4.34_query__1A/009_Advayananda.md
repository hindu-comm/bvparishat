ॐ  

Respectful Members,

  
Hari Om! Salutations.  
  

My thoughts on this very interesting point.

  
  

In Advaita Vedanta, what is removed is the ignorance of the Self. The Self, the Reality, is nityasiddha and svayamprakāśa.  
  
Presently the student has a misconception that 'I am a limited jīva.' This is erroneous thinking or ajñāna. The Guru, that is a śrotriya and brahmaniṣṭha, points out to the student, the error in his thinking

of himself to be the jīva.

That is what is meant by

 saying that the Guru teaches you about your ignorance - "उपदेक्ष्यन्ति तेऽज्ञानं ज्ञानिनस्तत्त्वदर्शिनः".

And that way he puts an end to the student's saṁsāra.  
  
This is indeed an interesting way of looking at this verse. 



Sant-sāhitya is replete with many such unique insights.

  
  
In Shri Guru Smriti,  
Advayananda
