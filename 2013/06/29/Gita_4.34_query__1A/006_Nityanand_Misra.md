Such an Anvaya is strange to say the least (चिन्त्य इति प्रतिभाति). It needs more clarification. If one wants, one can explain "अज्ञानम्" as "अकारो वासुदेवः" and then "अस्य ज्ञानम् अज्ञानम्" by षष्ठीतत्पुरुष or "अविषयकज्ञानम्=अज्ञानम्" as मध्यमपदलोपिसमास. Or one can get तत् तु अदर्शिनः. But all this is not really required here. This is one of the simpler verses of Gita (नीलकण्ठ calls it स्पष्टार्थः श्लोकः) with at least the Anvaya not requiring any deeper contextual or grammatical analysis.  
  
You can see eleven Sanskrit commentaries on this verse under <http://goo.gl/OeVUZ> . मध्वाचार्य and जयतीर्थ have not commented on the word ज्ञान. The other nine commentaries viz those of अभिनवगुप्त, शङ्कराचार्य, आनन्दगिरि, रामानुज, हनुमत्पैशाचभाष्य, वेङ्कटनाथ, वल्लभाचार्य, पुरुषोत्तम and नीलकण्ठ take the word to be ज्ञान and not अज्ञान. Even recent commentaries like साधकसञ्जीवनी (Gita Press) and श्रीराघवकृपाभाष्यम् of my Guru take the word as ज्ञान and not अज्ञान.  
  
I do not have the commentary by Sathya Sai. But one link here (<http://bababooks.org/SathyaSaiGita/chapter4.html>) cites his Gîtâ Vahini on the verse where the Anvaya is again taken as ज्ञान and not अज्ञान.  
  
Nothing much can be said more until I read the the full explanation from the commentary. Is the Anvaya and word-for-word meaning derived at using grammar? Is the पूर्वपक्ष (ज्ञानं in the अन्वय ) critically examined and rejected? If not, one may be better off sticking to the पूर्वपक्ष.
