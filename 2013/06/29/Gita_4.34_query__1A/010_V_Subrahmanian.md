In the bRhadAraNyaka up. 4.3.20, the last part of the mantra is thus given:  
  
....तदत्राविद्यया मन्यतेऽथ यत्र देव इव राजेवाहमेवेदं सर्वोऽस्मीति मन्यते सोऽस्य परमो लोकः ॥ 20.  
  
In the bhAShyam Shankaracharya says:    
  
..एवमत्यन्तप्रक्षीयमाणा अविद्या, उद्भूता च विद्या सर्वात्मविषया यदा, तदा स्वप्नेऽपि तद्भावभावितोऽहमेवेदं सर्वोऽस्मि इति मन्यते । स यः सर्वात्मभावः सोऽस्य परमो लोकः परम आत्मभावः स्वाभाविकः । यत्तु सर्वात्मभावादर्वाक् वालाग्रमात्रमपि अन्यत्वेन दृश्यते नाहमस्मीति तदवस्था अविद्या । तया अविद्यया प्रत्युपस्थापिता अनात्मभावाः लोकाः तेऽपरमाः स्थावरान्ताः तान् संव्यवहारविषयान् लोकानपेक्ष्य अयं सर्वात्मभावः समस्तोऽनन्तोऽनन्तरोऽबाह्यः सोऽस्य परमो लोकः । तस्मादपकृष्यमाणायामविद्यायां, विद्यायां च काष्ठां गतायां सर्वात्मभावो मोक्षः ।  
  
The above mantra is a description of the dream state and what a dreamer feels in that state. And the effect of Self-knowledge manifesting even in the Knower's dream state. The translation of the relevant portion of the bhashyam is:  
  
// ...Having been installed as a ruler of a state (in the waking state), he thinks in his dreams also that he is a king, for he is imbued with the impressions of his kingly state. Similarly, when (in the waking state), his *ignorance is extremely attenuated,* and the knowledge that **'he comprises all'** arises, he thinks under the influence of these impressions in the dream state also, **'This (universe) is myself, who am all.'** That, this identity with all (the universe), is his highest state, the Atman's own natural, supreme state. When, prior to this realization of identity with all, he views the latter as other than himself *even by a hair's breadth*, thinking, 'This is not myself,' that is the state of ignorance. The states brought on by ignorance, down to the stationary existence, are all inferior states. Compared with these - states with which the jiva has relative dealings - the above state of identity with all, infinite and without interior or exterior, is his supreme state. Therefore, when ignorance is eliminated and knowledge reaches its perfection, the state of identity with all, which is another name for liberation, is attained.//  
\[Sw.Madhavananda, p.458. advaita ashrama\]    
  
The above description has the element of both parokSha and aparokSha jnAnam. And the transition from the former to the latter is also stated there and even in the penultimate state of the culmination of paroksha jnAnam in aparokShajnAnam the perception of bheda, difference, is termed as avidyA alone. That state is still of the parokSha jnAnam. The aspirant knows that the shAstra and Acharya have taught the abheda darshana, sarvAtmabhAva, but to make it aparoksha is the greatest task.
Till such time it is parokSha only. And that is termed avidyA.  
  
Coming back to the Bh.GitA verse in question, the word 'ajnAna' refers to this parokShajnAna (avidyA) and it becomes aparokSha, jnAna, vidyA, only by the effort of the aspirant.  
  
The idea of 'अ’ indicating Vishnu did occur to me at the first instance. I remembered the Madhva-bhAShya for the Kathopanishat mantra 1.2.20 portion: 'तमक्रतुः पश्यति वीतशोको धातुः प्रसादान् महिमानमात्मनः’
 Here for the word 'अक्रतुः’ is explained as 'अ = विष्णुः, तत्क्रतुः = विष्णुविषयकसंकल्पः वीतशोको भवति । With this, the ’अज्ञानम्’ of the verse will mean विष्णुविषयकज्ञानम्.  
  
In the Ishopanishad mantra 11 the word 'avidyA' refers to karma and 'vidyA' refers to upAsana.  
  
The above description of the Br.up. is as per advaita. Other schools may have other interpretations for the Br.up. mantra.
