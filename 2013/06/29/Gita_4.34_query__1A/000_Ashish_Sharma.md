Dear Learned Scholars and Guruvars

Pranaam

  

There is is Sloka of Gita 4.34 as:

तद्विद्धि प्रणिपातेन परिप्रश्नेन सेवया \|

उपदेक्ष्यन्ति ते ज्ञानं ज्ञानिनस्तत्त्वदर्शिनः \|\|४-३४\|\|

  

Sai Baba in Saccha charit had mentioned to put avagrah betweenते ज्ञानं and to read as "उपदेक्ष्यन्ति तेऽज्ञानं ज्ञानिनस्तत्त्वदर्शिनः \|"

  

Kindly explain me that doesn't it change the meaning of sloka? A tattvadarshi will impart gyan or agyan?

Please clear my doubt as might be I am thinking on a wrong track.

  

Thanks in advance

  

Regards
