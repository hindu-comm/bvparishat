I have not studied the text by Saibaba mentioned by you. One explanation I can think of is: what an aspirant receives from the AchArya is parokSha jnAnam and it is the aspirant who has to 'convert' it to aparokSha jnAnam by mananam and nididhyAsanam. So, it could be that parokSha jnAnam is called 'ajnAnam' for it cannot directly result in liberation. Only aparoksha jnAnam can be called 'jnAnam' in the true sense for that alone conforms to the declaration: jnAnAdeva tu kaivalyam and the Bh.Gita declaration of that very chapter: jnAnena tu tadajnAnam yeShAm nAshitam AtmanaH... ajnAnanAsha can take place only through (aparokSha) jnAnam. Or the 4th ch. verse: jnAnam labdhvA parAm shAntim achirENAdhigacchati (by attaining (aparokSha) jnAnam one will obtain quickly supreme peace).  
  
To sum up, in a sense it can be said: as long as one does not get aparokSha jnAnam, the parokSha jnAnam gained through shAstra and AchArya is only ajnAnam.  
  
Maybe others in this forum have other explanations.
