Very doubtful. Can you cite any usage where परोक्षज्ञानम् is called "अज्ञानम्"? Or can you cite any derivation using Paninian grammar (or any other grammar or NIrukta) where the word "अज्ञानम्" is shown to mean "परोक्षज्ञानम्". I have not come across examples of नञ् (from which the अ in अज्ञान comes) being used in the sense of परोक्ष. E.g. परोक्षभूत (लिङ् लकार) is never called अभूत, it is still भूत.  
  
ज्ञानम् comes from ज्ञा + ल्युट्. ल्युट् in ज्ञानम् can come from two Sutras  
1. भावे ल्युट् by 3-3-115 ल्युट् च -> In this case ज्ञानम् is to be understood as "Knowing or knowledge"  
2. करणे ल्युट् by 3-3-117 करणाधिकरणयोश्च -> In this case ज्ञानम् is to be understood as "The means of Knowledge" (Books, स्वाध्याय, श्रद्धा, प्रणिपात, परिप्रश्न, सेवा, etc)  
This is followed by अनुबन्धलोप्, युवोरनाकौ 7-1-1 and अकः सवर्णे दीर्घः 6-1-101  
( Both भावे ल्युट् and करणे ल्युट् meanings are explained here <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyrNU90Ps4E> )  
Then अज्ञानम् comes optionally from 'न ज्ञानम्' by नलोपो नञः \[उत्तरपदे\] (6-3-73)  
  
Nowhere in the whole prakriya for अज्ञानम् do I see anything that can mean "परोक्ष ज्ञान".
