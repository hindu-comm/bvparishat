Namaste

1\. This is an interesting deliberation about multiple points:

  

A\) authenticity of text

  

B\) stretch ability if text for convenience of interpretation(- pratibhaa?!)

  

C\) ingenuity of scholarship in justifying diametrically opposite meanings?!

  

My straight question: when will a text reading be considered authentic? When will take a ' vakya' (- paurusheya or apaurusheya) as firmed up (= nights, poorna) final articulation (= uccharana / darshana/ sookta/ sutra)- that can not be further modified without mutilating the original intention??

  

  

This sort of verbal and linguistic jugglery - using flexibility of Samskrutha Vyakarana Niyama is not good for Shastra or kavya; or for vyavahara .
