Pranaam Learned Scholars and Shankar Ji

  

I found about this shloka detail from Shri PR Ramamurthy ji. I got info from his blog and then had a conversation with him on fone and he told that he has an old copy of pancharatnaGeeta of Geetapress, in which it was written. But now new editions is not having this shloka thatswhy asked you all the transslation of this shloka. I am pasting below the extract of the mail of Ramamurthy ji regarding this shloka:  

  

"Dear sri sharma,



This sloka is in Anusriti which is in Anushasanika parva, danadharma in Mahabharata

as indicated below:

"इति श्रीमहाभारते आनुशासनिके पर्वणि दानधर्मे

श्रीवैष्णोर्दिव्यमनुस्मृतिस्तोत्रं संपूर्णम् ॥"



This stotra is in a book called Pancharatna Gita published by Gita Press Gorakhpur. "
