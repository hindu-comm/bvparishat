Allah is an Arabic word and it is a compound word coming from Al + ilah = \[Alilah\] = Allah. The prefix "Al" is used to give respect. Of course ila (Ila), to my knowledge, also means the Bhumata or the mother Earth. In Narad Pancharatra Lord Vishnu has been mentioned as "ILAPATI". Then that could pose the question : "Was Islam originally
based on the worship of the mother earth?" If not there is no other way there could be any connection between the word "Allah" and Hinduism. May be in the Emperor Akbar's time some Muslim scholar wrote the "Allopanishad" to influence the Hindus into accepting Islam.
