हरिः ॐ,  
  
चतुर्भिश्च = ओ श्रावय / आ श्रावय (अध्वर्युः आग्नीध्रम्) : adhvaryu asks Agniidhra if it is alright to start the yajana.  
चतुर्भिश्च = अस्तु श्रौषट् (आग्नीध्रः अध्वर्युम्): Agniidhra gives the go ahead (astu) with shrauShAT (shrauShaT kills rAkShasas)  
द्वाभ्याम् = यज (अध्वर्युः होतरम्): adhvaryu orders the hotA to pronounce the shastra (r^ik mantra) for the particular deity.  
पञ्चभिः = ये यजामहे (होता अध्वर्युम्): Hota says "we will do yajana".  
द्वाभ्याम् = वौषट् (होता) : at the end of the shastra, hotA pronounces vauShaT after this, the adhvaryu gives AhutiH.  
  

 The meaning of the shloka is that viShNu, who is invited thus using the above 17 syllables, may he protect us.  
  

 for anything to be called as yaj\~na, the above 17 syllables need to be pronounced. yaj\~no vai viShNuH.  
  
 Now a days, unfortunately, people use the word "yaj\~na" very loosely. An impression is sought to be created that if Ahutis are given in a large homakuNDa, it is a yaj\~na, else it is a homa / havana.  
  

स्वस्ति,  

 जय भवानी भारती,  

 श्रीवत्सः
