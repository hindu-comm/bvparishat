This too is not correct. हलादि (हलादेः) cannot qualify अत् लघु (अतः लघोः). In the Ashtadhyayi, आदि stands for "beginning/commencement", and not for "precedent". A लघु अत् (लघु अकार) is simply the single-vowel "अ", which has अ in the beginning and अ in the end, so it is आदि (अ + आदि, अकार आदिर्यस्य) and आन्त (अ + अन्त, अकारोऽन्तो यस्य). "हलादि" when taken as बहिव्रीहि (as you are attempting), means "that which has a हल्/consonant in the beginning". By definition, अ which is the आदि of अत् लघु is not हल्, so अत् लघु cannot be हलादि.  
  
In other words, {अत् लघु} and {हलादि} are disjoint sets and therefore हलादि ***cannot*** qualify अत् लघु.  
  
When the विवक्षा is "of the अत् लघु which is preceded by हल्", Panini would rather say हलपरस्य अतः लघोः.
