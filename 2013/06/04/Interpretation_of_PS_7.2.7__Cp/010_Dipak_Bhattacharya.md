The matter, I think, has been viewed from the major points of view. The śāstric point of view on the aṅgatva or otherwise of the aṭ/āṭ was stated by me in the first depositin:

“तिपि शपि विकरणे ... विकरणविशिष्टस्याङ्गस्य अडागमः।‘ So the Bālamanoramā. This solves your problem. There is a pakşāntara लावस्थायामेवाडागमः.” Only the pakşāntara stated in the Mahābhāşya requires discretion. That is not applicable here. Does this and the volume of discussion that followed not suffice? Without new points to bring in should we not now better close it!?

Best
