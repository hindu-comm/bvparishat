PS 7.2.7 अतो हलादेर्लघोः ।  
  
Here is the first part of the Kashika vritti on this sutra:  
  
हलादेरङ्गस्य लघोरकारस्य इडादौ सिचि परस्मैपदपरे परतो विभाषा वृद्धिर्न भवति । अकणीत् अकाणीत् ।  
  
The example is : अ + कण् + इ + (सिच्) + ई + त् ।  
  
However, सिच् comes only in लुङ् for which a हलादि root will have अट् as आगम , the result of which is that the अङ्ग is not हलादि anymore but अजादि । In order for this rule to apply, it seems to me that one of the following must apply:  
  

-   The आगम of अट् happens **after** this rule is applied (I would like
    to know of paribhashas which indicate as to which stage of the
    प्रक्रिया the आगम should be brought in) -   The term हलादि should be interpreted as a qualifier for लघु , i.e.
    the rule applies when the लघु is preceded by a हल्

  
Any help on resolving this matter will be appreciated.  
  
Thanks,
