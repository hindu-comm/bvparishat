I believe the अङ्ग is still हलादि. अजादि यस्मात्प्रत्ययविधिस्तदादि प्रत्ययेऽङ्गम् (1-4-13). प्रत्यय is from धातु. That from the धातु onwards (not including the आगम) is termed अङ्ग.

Irrespective of when theआगम of अट् happens,अङ्गवृद्धि is अन्तरङ्ग कार्य of धातु relative to combination ofधातुwith the अट् आगम which is relatively बहिरङ्ग. अन्तरङ्ग कार्य takes priority over बहिरङ्ग कार्य and is to be done first.
