Dear Vidvan Srinivasan Acharya and Srikantha Acharya,

  

You may please find some verses of Bhagavata that speaks about the sons of Bhagavan Sri Krishna:

  

The first son of Queen Rukmiëé was Pradyumna, and also born of her were Cärudeñëa, Sudeñëa and the powerful Cärudeha, along with Sucäru, Cärugupta, Bhadracäru, Cärucandra, Vicäru and Cäru, the tenth. None of these sons of Lord Hari was less than his father.  

  

The ten sons of Satyabhämä were Bhänu, Subhänu, Svarbhänu, Prabhänu, Bhänumän, Candrabhänu, Båhadbhänu, Atibhänu (the eighth), Çrébhänu and Pratibhänu. Sämba, Sumitra, Purujit, Çatajit, Sahasrajit, Vijaya, Citraketu, Vasumän, Draviòa and Kratu were the sons of Jämbavaté. These ten, headed by Sämba, were their father's favorites.

  

The sons of Nägnajité were Véra, Candra, Açvasena, Citragu, Vegavän, Våña, Äma, Çaìku, Vasu and the opulent Kunti.

Çruta, Kavi, Våña, Véra, Subähu, Bhadra, Çänti, Darça and Pürëamäsa were sons of Kälindé. Her youngest son was Somaka.

  

Mädrä's sons were Praghoña, Gätravän, Siàha, Bala, Prabala, Ürdhaga, Mahäçakti, Saha, Oja and Aparäjita.

Mädrä is also known as Lakñmaëä.

  

Mitravindä's sons were Våka, Harña, Anila, Gådhra, Vardhana, Unnäda, Mahäàsa, Pävana, Vahni and Kñudhi.

Saìgrämajit, Båhatsena, Çüra, Praharaëa, Arijit, Jaya and Subhadra were the sons of Bhadrä, together with Väma, Äyur and Satyaka.

  

Déptimän, Tämratapta and others were the sons of Lord Kåñëa and Rohiëé. Lord Kåñëa's son Pradyumna fathered the greatly powerful Aniruddha in the womb of Rukmavaté, the daughter of Rukmé. O King, this took place while they were living in the city of Bhojakaöa.

  

My dear King, the sons and grandsons of Lord Kåñëa's children numbered in the tens of millions. Sixteen thousand mothers gave rise to this dynasty.

  

  

With regards,

Sri Bharataramadasa,

Dvaitavedanta-shastravidyarthi

Mangaluru
