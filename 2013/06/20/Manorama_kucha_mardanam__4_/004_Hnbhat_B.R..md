It is not the correctness of the two names, but the proper name given to the commentary by Jagannatha or in the available records. I made a search with both the names and found only one publication in KDSS No.34 Edited with Hindi Commentary, with "kucamardana" against the other "kucamardini" in other records. Hence the doubt. And not the grammatical correctness of the two words. Anyhow both seem to be fairly used as you have suggested. I wanted to confirm any one of the title given by Jagannatha himself.

  

Thank you for the information.
