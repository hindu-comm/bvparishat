I think the title of the commentary by Jagannatha Bhatta on Praudhamanorama is properly called प्रौढमनोरमाकुचमर्दिनी and not कुचमर्दनम्।

  

Scholars may correct me if I am wrong. Pankaj Vyas has replied about the availability of the book. The availability online in ebook may be searched through Google Search as well or in DLI or [archive.org](http://archive.org).
