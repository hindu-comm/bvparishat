Dear scholars

  

I heard this verse sometime back in a discussion in India but no longer recall it completely. It is regarding Kumārila Bhaṭṭa and Prabhākara. Probably the verse is handed down by tradition and not part of any work. The background is when Kumārila Bhaṭṭa was worried what will happen to his knowledge after he dies, he uttered the first half the verse. The second half was uttered by Prabhākara who assured Kumārila Bhaṭṭa that his legacy was in safe hands.

  

The verse goes something like this

  

किं करोमि क्व गच्छामि को .... करिष्यते

चिन्ता .... न? ते? कार्या वर्तमाने प्रभाकरे

  

I would be much obliged if somebody can help with the complete verse and the source.

  

Thanks, Nityanand
