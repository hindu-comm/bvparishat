Subodh Kumar Ji

  

The version you have quoted appears grammatically incorrect as it uses the vocative form (कुधर्म) whose Anvaya would be troublesome, and also the masculine pronoun यः with the neuter pronoun तत्‌.

  

I found something similar here -[http://sa.wikiquote.org/wiki/स्मृतिसूक्तयः\_(धर्मः)](http://sa.wikiquote.org/wiki/स्मृतिसूक्तयः_(धर्मः))

  

where the reading is "धर्मं यो बाधते धर्मो न स धर्मः कथञ्चन" and it is ascribed to Vyasa Smriti, Prathama Khanda, page 17 (of some publication).

  

I do not have the source to check, but MUM website has a PDF of the text here -<http://is1.mum.edu/vedicreserve/smriti/02Vyasa_Smriti.pdf>- which may be checked.
