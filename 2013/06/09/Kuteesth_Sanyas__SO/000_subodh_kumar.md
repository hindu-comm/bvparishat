No distinct reference to Sanyasis found in Vedas. In smriti granthas starting with Manusmriti Sanyas Ashram details are found . In Brihat Parasharsmriti the details of कुष्टिचक सन्यासी are found inthe following Shloakas.: This perhaps comes closer to the practical life situations today.

  

1\. पुत्रस्य भ्रातृपुत्रस्य भ्रातृ-दौहित्रयोरपि \| तदुपान्त कुटीस्थो य: स भैक्ष्य वृत्तिभुक्‌ द्विज: \| प्रतिचर्याकृत सोsपि यो वास: पूत: वारिप: \|\|बृ .पारा. स्मृ. 12.165 

2\. तथा त्रिदण्डभृत शान्त आत्मज्ञ: स कुटीचक: \|\| बृ. पारा. स्मृ. 12.166

KuTeechak Sanyasee lives in his abode , wears normal symbolic attire , lives in quarters provided and feeds himself on charity provided by his sons and relations. Follows in the path of Yoga for his liberation (And spending his time in social .

I request scholars to kindly correct me in my interpretation of कुटीस्थ
सन्यासी and help in improving the understanding about old age management system according to our scriptures.

With utmost regards to all,
