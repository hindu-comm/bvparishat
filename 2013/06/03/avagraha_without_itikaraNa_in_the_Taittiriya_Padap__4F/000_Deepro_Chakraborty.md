Dear All,

It is a question to the traditional practitioners of the Taittiriya school of the Yajurveda and scholars who are well-acquainted with the various पाठ-s of the तैत्तिरीयसंहिता. Is there any case noticed in the पदपाठ where an इङ्ग्यपद i.e. separated with an अवग्रह is not preceded by इति? Please let me know.

Regards

Deepro.
