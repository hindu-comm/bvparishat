This book presents a short philosophical treatise in which twenty rival theories of the liberated state (*mok**ṣa*) are introduced and countered, and a long, discursive commentary that explores and develops the arguments that the treatise advances or implies. The original treatise comprises fifty-nine Sanskrit verses composed by Sadyojyotiḥ (c.ï¿½675ï¿½725 AD), the earliest named Śaiva philosopher of the Mantramārga of whom works survive. The commentator, Bhaṭṭa Rāmakaṇṭha (c.ï¿½950ï¿½1000 AD), was a Kashmirian whose writings systematised the doctrines of the classical Śaiva Siddhānta, for some centuries the dominant school of tantric Śaivism.

ï¿½

Presented here is a first critical edition of these interlinked works and a richly annotated English translation. A lightly annotated introduction lays out clearly the ideas that the edited texts expound. Their study casts light not only on the history of Śaiva thought, but also on a number of religio-philosophical doctrines for which little other testimony survives.

**Keywords:** Liberation (mokṣa), Śaiva siddhānta, Indian philosophy, Hindu theology, Śaivism, Sanskrit philology, Sadyojyotiḥ, Rāmakaṇṭha

He has published critical editions of Śaiva works and of classical Sanskrit poetry (most recently, with Csaba Dezső, the eighth-century *Ku**ṭṭanīmata *of Dāmodaragupta). He is currently based in Paris, where he gives lectures on Indian and Cambodian Sanskrit literature at the ï¿½cole Pratique des Hautes ï¿½tudes (section des sciences religieuses).
