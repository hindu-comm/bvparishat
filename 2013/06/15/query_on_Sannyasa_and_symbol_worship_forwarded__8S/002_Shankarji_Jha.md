Regarding Vaanaprastha, there is a rule (Vide Manusmriti etc.) that the wife should be entrusted to the Children or be taken along in the forest. Likewise, even for Sannyaasa, there is some rule that only after settling all matters ---maintenance of wife etc. one is entitled to take Sannyaasa. Ignoring the rules of the Shaastras, one can do whatever he wants. Ther are several injunctions for Sannyaasins. Yatinam Yaana-gaaminam etc. Do the modern Sannyaasins follow them? With regards,
