Namaste,  
  

We can take the case of Adi Shankara. He had to take the permission from his mother to become a sannyashi. Even then he had to return to his mother for the express purpose of being with her during her last moment
and for performing her cremation and the last ritesn. So also a modern man taking up Sanyasha has to take the approval of his wife before leaving her. According to Manu, in the absence of the husband, a woman is to be looked after by her son. Thus it is possible for a man to leave his wife provided she has son to look after her. If she has no son (noor any brother willling to take her responsibilty) her husband cannot desert her.
