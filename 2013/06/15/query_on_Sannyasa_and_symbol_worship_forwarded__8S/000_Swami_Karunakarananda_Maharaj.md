Respected Scholars,  
  

Harih Om. These are the questions put forward by a professor of Geneva University. I need scholars help in this.  
  
1. In Uddhava Gita, and other scriptures, when they speak of vanaprastha to sannyasin, they say that the Sannyasin renounces everything and goes away.  
Now the question (put by a professor of Geneva University who comes here) is, "if the man becomes a sannysain, what happens to the woman, his wife, who has become vanaprasthin like him in the forest? Will she go back to the world, or become sannyasin?"  
  
  
2. In the Brahma Sutra (4.3.15 and 4.3.16). it is expressly stated that, those who meditate on symbols will not go to Brahma loka.  
Now, What symbols are meant here? Omkara?. Image of God?  
If those who meditate on symbols dont go to Brahma loka, then how can Krishna and others teach meditation on symbols?  
  
  

Please give scriptural references to your answers is the request of that scholar.
