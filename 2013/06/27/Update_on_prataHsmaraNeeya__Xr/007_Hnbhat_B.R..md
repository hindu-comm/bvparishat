I will be also helpful if anyone of them, either Subrahmanyam or Puranic make clear what this description of स्मृति in Purana-s and Yogashastra, has to do with the original question on प्रातःस्मरणीय and how it is relevant with the original question on the use of the word:

  

"A doubt has come from Gita Press,Gorakhpur regarding the use of the

word "PraataHsmaraNeeya" as a part of the address to someone in a  
sadas.The objection raised is that this adjective should be used only  
for a departed person and not certainly for one who is still alive.  
I think for a person living or a person or for one who is no more,this  
word may be used.There be a local variation in current standards of  
such usage.As for example earlier in Sanskrit one could use 's'ree'  
before one's name oneself which is still in vogue in certain Indian  
languages,but it's not so in case of Hindi etc.  
***Someone may kindly clarify whether such any convention in respect of  
the use of "praataHsmaraNeeya" is warranted in Sanskrit or other  
Indian languages or it depends on the context and intention of thespeaker."***

In case it is forgotten, I just highlighted portion warranting reply. Otherwise any further postings without relevance to the question could be rejected by the readers or the moderators before posting. Any new discussion warrants a new subject line to reflect its content as the first post itself has set an example.
