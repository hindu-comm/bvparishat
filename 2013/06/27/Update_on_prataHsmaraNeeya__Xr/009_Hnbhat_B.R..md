I think there is no need to pursue the thread unless something really connected to the topic of 'prAtaHsmaraNIyaH' its grammar or its usage in popular texts, etc. is contributed. All other discussions will be only deviating from the topic.   

  

Thanks for the kind reply. Even the grammatical etymology or its प्रक्रिया following all the process of application of पाणिनीयसूत्र-s or वार्तिक-s thereon application to get the form is not warranted by the question as both the words are of common simple forms and not any doubt regarding the form has been asked for.
