I agree with Sri H.N.Bhat. My first response on this thread was to simply point out an instance where the term prAtaHsmaraNIya..' was used in print. When Shri Madhav Puranik mentioned //....Hence smaraNa is also remembering deities through yoga// I responded with the bhAgavata practice of bhagavadanusmaraNam. I think there is no need to pursue the thread unless something really connected to the topic of 'prAtaHsmaraNIyaH' its grammar or its usage in popular texts, etc. is contributed. All other discussions will be only deviating from the topic.
