Please quote the sUtra-s whether they relate to the concept in the same way.

  

Here is the text you have quoted partly:

  

स्मृतिपरिशुद्धौ स्वरूपशून्येवार्थमात्रनिर्भासा निर्वितर्का ॥४३॥

  

smṛti-pariśuddhau svarūpa-śūnyeva-arthamātra-nirbhāsā nirvitarkā \|\|43\|\|

  

*Once all previous impressions (smriti)* have been purged and one’s own nature is clearly perceptible, then only the object of contemplation emanates light. This is nirvitarka samapatti. \|\|43\|\|

  

In the above, it is doubtful whether the word स्मृति means the same as स्मरण concept of Shaiva and Vaishnava Bhagavata cults.

though literally they seem to be synonymous. It relates to the memory stored in the mind, the image of the object of meditation referred to in the process of "samaadhi" in the previous sUtra-s.

  

तत्र शब्दार्थज्ञानविकल्पैः संकीर्णा सवितर्का समापत्तिः ॥४२॥  

  

  

The Yogashastra has clearly defined

अनुभूतविषयासंप्रमोषः स्मृतिः ॥११॥

anu-bhūta-viṣaya-asaṁpramoṣaḥ smṛtiḥ \|\|11\|\|

Recollections are engendered by the past, insofar as the relevant experience has not been eclipsed. \|\|11\|\|

अभ्यासवैराग्याभ्यां तन्निरोधः ॥१२॥

abhyāsa-vairāgya-ābhyāṁ tan-nirodhaḥ \|\|12\|\|

The state of yoga is attained via a balance between assiduousness (abhyasa) and imperturbability (vairagya). \|\|12\|\|

  

among the vikalpas ---

  

Lacking that, misconceptions (vritti) skew our perceptions. \|\|4\|\|

वृत्तयः पञ्चतय्यः क्लिष्टाक्लिष्टाः ॥५॥

vṛttayaḥ pañcatayyaḥ kliṣṭākliṣṭāḥ \|\|5\|\|

There are five types of misconceptions (vrittis), some of which are more agreeable than others: \|\|5\|\|

प्रमाण विपर्यय विकल्प निद्रा स्मृतयः ॥६॥

pramāṇa viparyaya vikalpa nidrā ***smṛtayaḥ*** \|\|6\|\|

insight, error, imaginings, deep sleep, and recollections.

  

and it also has to be obstructed for चित्तवृत्तिनिरोध accoding to Patanjali. No there are many other references as you have already given refer to this वृत्ति.

  

Yogashastra has got only one section on dhyana, dharana and samadhi - trayam ekatra samyamaH.

  

In the Vibhutipada ---

  

  

देशबन्धः चित्तस्य धारणा ॥१॥  

तत्र प्रत्ययैकतानता ध्यानम् ॥२॥

तदेवार्थमात्रनिर्भासं स्वरूपशून्यमिवसमाधिः ॥३॥  

  

The above are called antaranga --- संयमः\|

  

त्रयमेकत्र संयमः ॥४॥

  

trayam-ekatra saṁyamaḥ \|\|4\|\|

  

The three processes of dharana, dhyana, and samadhi, when taken together, are the components of meditation (samyama). \|\|4\|\|

  

  

And many more references in the भाष्य and its commentaries on which pages of pages can be written on the concept of स्मृति in Yogashastra and other Purana-s.

  

Now please tell me what is the relevance of such exercise or such a reply to the question raised in the subject line and in the first message:
