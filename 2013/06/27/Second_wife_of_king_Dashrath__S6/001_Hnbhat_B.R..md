This doesn't show anything on the count of the number of wives. This only shows Kaikeyi was his dearest young queen and Kausalya was enthrowned with him पट्टमहिषी Unless Valmiki has said anything in this respect that the order of wives was followed specifically. So he shared the remainder of the Charu half, given to Kausalya, and had to share it between the two younger queens.

  

This seems to be logical unless anything said by Valmiki has said to the contrary of order of wives specifically.
