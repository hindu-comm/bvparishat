Sir,  
  
I was about to ask for any reference to the belief that Hanuman is ShivAmsha. In the references provided by you there are two references: one from the skanda purANam and another from the Valmiki Ramayanam itself (Vettam Mani) \[VR kishkindha kanda sarga 66\]. I would like to know whether all Vaishnavas accept this. Else, do they provide any other explanation to these references? Do the standard VR commentaries strengthen such a belief?
