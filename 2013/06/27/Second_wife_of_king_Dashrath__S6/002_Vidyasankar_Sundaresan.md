There are so many popular versions of the division of pAyasam amongst the queens of Dasaratha that the actual Valmiki Ramayana account seems to be quite unknown to most people.



As per Valmiki, it is the king himself who gives half first to Kausalya (kausalyAyai ... ardhaM dadau), a quarter to Sumitra (ardhAd ardhaM dadau... sumitrAyai), an eighth to Kaikeyi (kaikeyyai cAvazishTArdhaM dadau) and the remaining avazishTArdha again to Sumitra, after some thought (pradadaucAvazishTArdhaM... ...anucintya sumitrAyai punaH). The avazishTArdha given to Kaikeyi, in Valmiki's recounting, has to be taken as a tatpurusha, and the second avazishTArdha, given to Sumitra, has to be taken as a karmadhAraya, if the division is assumed to have left no remnant pAyasa.



If one assumes that the order of division indicates an order of queenly seniority, then Sumitra should be taken as the second queen and Kaikeyi as the third. Why Sumitra was given another one-eighth portion and why Kaikeyi was not just givenaquarter portionis left mysterious. Valmiki is silent about what Dasaratha's anucintana was his decision to divide it thus. Please see the 16th sarga of bAlakANDa.
