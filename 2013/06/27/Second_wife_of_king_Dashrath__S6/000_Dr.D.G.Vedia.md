Dear Scholars,

             King Dashratha gave charu given by sage rushyashrunga to kaushalya &Kaikeyi Both gave half of charu to Sumitra. This shows thatKaikeyiwas second wife and sumitra was the third one. So, The question arises who was the youngest wife either Sumitra or Kaikeyi?

  

Please shed the light on the issue........

  

  

With Best Regards,

  

  

Dr.D.G.Vedia
