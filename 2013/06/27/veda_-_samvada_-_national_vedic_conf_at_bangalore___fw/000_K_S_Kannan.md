Dear all,

  

Here is the almost-final prog./general invitation of the Vedic Conference

All are welcome to attend.

Separate mails will be sent to the participants with additional info.

  

Thanks for all who sent Abstracts/Papers.

Those who have not sent Papers must do so at the earliest,

and at any rate before July 10th, failing which the papers may be cancelled.
