Pranaam Learned Scholars and Guruvars

  

As you all must be knowing that there are 745 slokas in Geeta instead of 700 slokas. Abhinav Gupta and Sarvato Bhadra too wrote a commentary on all slokas.

In 'Mahabharata' the Bhagwat Gita was told by Lord Krishna to  
Arjuna. It was composed in the Mahabharata in 'Bhisma Parwa' at 42  
chapter by the great sage Sri Vedavyasa Maharishi. After compleation  
of this chapter Sri Vedavyasa Maharshi mentiond the slokas naumber  
which was spoken by Lord Krishna, Arjuna, Sanjaya amd King  
Dhrutarashtra as 620, 57, 67, 1, respectively as mentiond below. .  
  
" Shatsataani samvisaani slokaanaam praaha kesavaha  
arjunaha saptapanchaasat saptashasthimcha sanjayaha  
dhrutaraastraha slokamekam giitaayaa maanamuchyate "

  
We may find this sloka in the 43 chapter of Mahabharata.  

  

But i have found mostly 700 slokas in Gita and specially in Gitapress books which are famous in north India under religious books.

As per one of my guru's instruction, i searched on critical edition of Mahabharata, in*Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute (BORI) in Pune.*

But did not found there also. Many scholars says that the commentory of Abhinav Gupta itself a proof for the existance of extra 45 shlokas.

Kindly give me the guidance as whether to consider 45 slokas in Geeta is appropriate or not? How to get the authenticity of those slokas?

I had mailed my query to Gitapress but yet no reply got from them.

  

Waiting for right direction.
