Shankara and Abhinava gupta comments on 2 different recessions of Bhagavad Gita. In given printed edition of a text it is the editors decision which verses he includes and which verses he retains.  
  

This is view of a scholar. This is a quote please see <http://lists.advaita-vedanta.org/archives/advaita-l/2012-November/033538.html>  
  
The Critical edition of the Mahabharata (The Bhagavadgita Being Reprint of Relevant Parts of Bhismaparvan, edited by Shripad Krishna Belvalkar, second reprint, BORI, Poona, 1968, footnote, p. 77) does not recognize the five and half verses of Adhyaya 43 of the Bhishma Parvan beginning with the words 'Gita sugita..', which refer to the existence of 745 verses in the Gita, they are available in other editions (like Mahabharata, vol. 4, Bhismaparva, translated by M.N.Dutt, eds. Ishwar Chandra Sharma and O.N. Bimali, Parimal Publications, Delhi, 2006, p. 115).  
  
There is a difference of opinion if these lines form part of the genuine Mahabhara. But the Mahabharata commentator Nilakantha remarks that the Gauda (Northern) recession of the Mahabhara goes without these lines. The Southern recension of the Mahabharata, where these lines occur, might have been used by Keshava Kashmiri Bhatta and other Kashmirian commentators ('The Computation of the Bhagavadgita' by Pandit R. M. Shastri, Allahabad University Studies XII, Arts and Science, 1936, pp.67-68), though while commenting on the Gita they follow the Vulgate text containing 700 hundred verses only.
