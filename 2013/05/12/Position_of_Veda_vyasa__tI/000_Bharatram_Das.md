Dear all,

  

Pranams to all the vidvajjana. I seek to know the true position of Veda Vyasa as held by the Shankara school and the Ramanuja school. Is he considered lord Narayana himself? Or is he considered an advanced Rshi? What role does he have to play in their anushthana etc.

  

I personally am of the opinion that in these schools there is no such specific gratitude to the person of VedaVyasa as can be found in the Madhva school, wherein he is irrevocably accepted as Lord Narayana himself. Not a Deva or a Rshi. And worship of Veda Vyasa is common place in the Madhva mathas. I have not found this in the Shankara or Ramanuja mathas. The Ramanuja school seems to derive their knowledge mainly from the Alvars and commenting on the Vedanta sutras of Vedavyasa was done merely out of social necessity, to confront the advaita school and ground the teachings of the Alvars in the more widely accepted Vedic literature.

  

May the learned kindly enlighten me in this regard.

  

Thank you.

Vidvajjana vidheya,

Bharath Raj Urs.
