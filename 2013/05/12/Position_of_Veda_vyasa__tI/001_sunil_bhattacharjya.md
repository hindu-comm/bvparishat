Dear friends,  
  
May be, it could appear that the Madhva school shows a lot of respects to Vedavyasa. However one thing baffles the scholars. Vedavyasa wrote the Mahabharata with the express desire to convey the vedic knowledge to the lay persons, who had no access to the Vedas but in the beginning of the Bhagavatam the sage Vedavyasa was shown as a very sad person and he tells Devarshi Narada that he wrote the Mahabharata for the lay persons but he failed in his objective. He was referring to the fact that for the lay persons the Mahabharata is not easy to understand. Then Narada advised him to write the Bhagavatam so that it would be understood by the lay persons. That means the Bhagavatam verses have straightforward meaning and is not difficult to understand. But Shri Madhvacharya thought that the sage Vedavyasa failed once again and that the verses in Bhagavatm are not at all easy to understand and that the verses have more than one meaning. Shri Madhvacharya says this in his Bhagavata Tatparya Nirnaya. To me it appears that Shri madhvacharya was pointing out the incompetence of Vedavyasa as a teacher.  
  

Regards,
