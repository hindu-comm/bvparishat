Thank you all for writing.  
  

In the Bhagavata Tatparya, it is said that the Bhagavata is pregnant with meaning. The verse 'artho'yam brahmasutranam......' is a quotation from Garuda Purana. And moreover I read the Chapter 5 and 6 of the first skandha of the Bhagavata again and again but could not see the point that Sunil Bhattacharyaji is making regarding the point that Bhagavatam is meant for the laymen. In fact in the mangalacarana itself Vedavyasa seems to be suggesting that this is not for the laymen. 'paramo nirmatsaranam satam' and '..krtibhih tat kshanat'. Narada is saying that the Lords activities should be further described and there should be a whole work dedicated to that cause.  
  

Yes Vedavyasa is a muni. Lord Narayana takes birth among humans, sages, animals, devatas and all species of life. But we cannot ascribe him on that basis to that species.  
  

I had not noticed the temple of Vedavyasa in Sringeri. Will make it a point to see it the next time i visit. Still in the daily anushtana, still I feel that Vedavyasa is more a part of it in the Madhva lineage.  
  

Again thank you all very much for caring to write.  

Bharath Raj Urs.
