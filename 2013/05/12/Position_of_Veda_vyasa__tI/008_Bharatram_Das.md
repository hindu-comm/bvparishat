Dear Sunil,

  

Thank you for your letter.

  

But no where in this passage from the Bhagavata purana do we see what you said. You had told that Vedavyasa wrote the Bhagavata for the less intelligent.

  

In this passage we see stri-shudra-dvija-bandhunam... which is a description of the Mahabharata. Please see carefully ... iti bharatam akhyanam..(line 5 in the above passage) in that same verse. Also line 12 ...bharata-vyapadeshena... Here bharata does not refer to the Bhagavata. It refers to the Mahabharata. And there also it is not stated that Mahabharata is only meant for the Stri shudra etc. What it says is that the genius of the work of Mahabharata is such that even the less intelligent can understand. Please do away with your misunderstanding.

  

Here in this passage what Sri Veda Vyasa is saying is that although he has written Mahabharata in such a way that even the stri, shudra etc. can benefit he still feels there is more that he wants to do.

  

Regards,

Bharath Raj Urs.
