Namamsi,  
  

Yes in the school of Madhva, As Prof HN Bhat stated, it is said that in each manvantara and kalpa, Vedvyasa-s are different. The Vedavyasa who streamlined the school of Vedic system and composed the Brahmasutras, Mahabharata and 18 Puranas in 28 Dvaparayuga of Vaivasvatamanvantara is the lord Narayana himself (refer to Sutrabhashya, Mahabharata and Bhagavata Tatparyanirnaya of Sri Madhva). In the forthcoming 29 Dvaparayuga of the Vaivasvata, the Drauni (Ashvatthama) will become the Vyasamaharshi.  
  

Vedavyasa, the son of Parashara and Satyavati, the father of Dhrtarashtra, Pandu and Vidura, and the Guru of Shuka, Jaimini, Vaishampayana, Paila, Suta and others, is also known as Vasishtha-krishna, Krishna-dvaipayana and Badarayana, an incarnation of Narayana to empower the Vedic schools. An avatara for Jnanakarya.  
  

Some other schools say that Vedavyasa is an Amshavatara of Narayana.  
  

I came to know that also the school of Sri Shankara says that Vyasa is lord Narayana. Many said that they describe him only as a Muni/Rshi according to Shankarasutrabhashya.  

  

Thank you,  

Srinivasan Acharya
