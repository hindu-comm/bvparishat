Anyhow, the statement of भगवद्गीता "मुनीनामहं व्यासः".(११.३७)quoted by Subrahmanyam is enough for the believers to believe and worship him as नारायण or sixth अवतार of him according to some पुराण-s. Whether the followers of certain schools worship him in temples or not is a matter of convention and tradition and has nothing to do with the philosophical schools represented by their आचार्य-s. It is in द्वापर both were considered as the incarnations कृष्णद्वैपायन and कृष्ण of नारायण according to the पुराण-s. In each मन्वन्तर and कल्प the व्यास-s are different according to लिङ्गपुराण.
