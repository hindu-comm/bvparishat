Dear scholars  
  
The परिभाषा "उपपदविभक्तेः कारकविभक्तिर्बलीयसी" is cited by Patanjali several times in the Mahabhashya - e.g. on Sutras 1.4.96, 2.3.4 and 3.1.19 (references from the Kielhorn-Abhayankar edition, the Chowkhambha edition of 1988 has the number as 1.4.95 for the first reference). It is followed by इति every time so I guess this predates Patanjali.  
  
What is the original source for the same?  
  
Thanks, Nityanand
