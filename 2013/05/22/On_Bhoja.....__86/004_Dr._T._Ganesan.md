The commentary called Taatparyadiipikaa was by one Sriikumaara who was
well versed in both Veda-s as well as in the Saivagama-s. He considers both the Veda-s and the Saivagama-s as equal authority. He writes from the Sivaadvaita point of view.  
The other one called Vritti is by Aghorasivaacaarya, the very well-known Saiva Acaarya of the 12th century who lived in Chidambaram but whose forefathers came from RaaDha desa, the Norh Bengal, propelled by a strong devotion to Nataraja at Chidambaram, and settled in the Chola desa. Aghorasivaacaarya interprets from Dvaita point of view which was the main basis for the earlier Saivasiddhanta aacaarya-s of Kashmir such as Sadyojyoti, Ramakantha, etc.
