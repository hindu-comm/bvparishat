Namaste  
  
In the 'tAtparyadIpikA' to the 'sUtasamhitA' (of the skandapurANam) Swami VidyaraNya cites, at the beginning of the 5th chapter titled 'shaktipUjAvidhAnam', a verse from Bhoja:  
  
शक्तो यया स शंभुर्भुक्तौ मुक्तौ च पशुगणस्यास्य ।  
तमेनां चिद्रूपामाद्यां सर्वात्मनाऽस्मि नतः ॥  
  
From which work of Bhoja is this verse? Are there citations from Bhoja found in works prior to Swami VidyAraNya (14th century)?  
  
Scholars are requested to kindly respond.
