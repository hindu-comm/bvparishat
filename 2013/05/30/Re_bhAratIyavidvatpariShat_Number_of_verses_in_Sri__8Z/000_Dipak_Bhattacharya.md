30 05 13

18 is a number for completeness like 100000. The editors of the crit. edn of the Mahābhārata did not try to arrive at this number for the Śatasāhasrīsaṃhitā. The Bhāgavata may be judged from the same point of view.

Namaste everyone.

If one counts verses in the SB then it will amount to14,094 verses (808+393+1416+1449+668+851+ 750+931+960+3936+1367+565). But traditionally SB is said to contain 18,000 verses. Are those 3906 verses now extinct ?
