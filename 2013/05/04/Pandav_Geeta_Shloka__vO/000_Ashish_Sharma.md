Dear Learned Scholars and Guruvars

Pranaam

  

There is a shloka in Anusmriti (In Mahabharat) as:

शमीगर्भस्य यो गर्भः तस्य गर्भस्य यो रिपुः \|

रिपुगर्भस्य यो गर्भः स मे विष्णुः प्रसीदतु \|\|

  

I found an old book of PanchGeeta by Geetapress Gorakhopur in which they have mentioned above Shloka but now neither in Mahabharata nor in PanchGeeta(new editions), Geetapress had not published this Shloka.

  

Can anyone tell me the exact meaning of this Shloka?

  

Regards
