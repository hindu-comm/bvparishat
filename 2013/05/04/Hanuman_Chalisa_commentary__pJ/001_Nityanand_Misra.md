Sharma Ji,  
  
Namo Hanumate. For a bilingual Hindi and English commentary on the Hanumāna Cālīsā please refer Appendix B (pp. 849 to 852) of -  
  
Ram Chandra Prasad (1999) \[First edition 1991\]. *Sri Ramacaritamanasa The Holy Lake Of The Acts Of Rama* (Illustrated, reprint ed.). Motilal Banarsidass. ISBN 978-81-208-0443-2.  
  
The commentary by Prasad is based on the Hindi commentary *Mahāvīrī* by my Guru. The footnote on page 849 by Prasad goes -  
  

श्रीहनुमानचालीसा की सर्वश्रेष्ठ व्याख्या के लिए देखें महावीरी व्याख्या, जिसके लेखक हैं प्रज्ञाचक्षु आचार्य श्रीरामभद्रदासजी। श्रीहनुमानचालीसा के प्रस्तुत भाष्य का आधार श्रीरामभद्रदासजी की ही वैदुष्यमंडित टीका है। इसके लिए मैं आचार्यप्रवर का ऋणी हूँ।  

\[For the best explanation of Śrīhanumānacālīsā, refer the Mahāvīrī commentary, whose author is the Prajñācakṣu Ācārya Śrīrāmabhadradāsa. The base for the commentary being presented is the commentary by Rambhadradas, which is adorned with erudition. For this, I am grateful to the eminent Acharya.\] (Translation mine)  

Unfortunately Mahāvīrī is currently out of print - only a few copies were published and all were sold out so even the Chitrakoot Ashram of the Guru does not have a copy. A republication is planned sometime this year or next year and I will let you know when it happens.  
  
Besides the above commentary, there are also the critical edition of Hanuman Chalisa edited by the Guru, and a Samskrita variant of Hanuman Chalisa titled [Śrīhanumaccatvāriṃśikā](http://jagadgururambhadracharya.org/pdfs/JR2012Srihanumaccatvarimsika.pdf) in the same Doha and Chaupai metres.  
  
Thanks, Nityanand
