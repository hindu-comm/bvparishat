Namaste  
  
I would like to know if the name 'subrahmaNyaH' (in the sense of kArtikeya, senAnI, skanda, ShaNmukha, etc. and NOT as a name of Indra, etc.) is used in any of the ancient works including the Vedas, purANas, Mahabharta, kAvyas, etc. My search yielded :  
  
The Baudhayana Dharmasutra mentions Skanda as 'Mahasena' and 'Subrahmanya.'  
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murugan>  
  
It appears that the Mahabharata has some references but I am keen on seeing the name 'subrahmaNya' there.  
  
Kindly provide the references too, if any.  
  
Warm regards and thanks,
