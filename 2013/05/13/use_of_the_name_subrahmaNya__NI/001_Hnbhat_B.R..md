In the Vicky article, they have neither given the reference to बौधायनधर्मसूत्र or महाभारत without which it seems not reliable or verified with the context as the word has many other meanings as can be seen in the above discussion.

  

Here was an inquiry on the name popular in Karnataka, but not replied by any yet:

Anyhow a search in the JNU database may be made for ANY reference to the name सुब्रह्मण्य or the adjective word.

  

Here is the search database link to search:

Somebody may search for the word in Baudhayana DharmaSutra to confirm if there is any reference denoting the son of शिव called popularly कार्तिकेय.
