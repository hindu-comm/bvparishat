Respected member,  
 While working on a specific topic I was looking for an exhaustive list of Philosophical dramas written in Sanskrit. after the initial search I have only few names in my hands.  

 Nyāya-mañjarī

 Prabodhacandrodaya  
 moha-parājaya  
 saṅkalpa-sūryodaya  
 caitanya-candrodaya

It would be really great if you share your knowledge with me regarding this above-mentioned topic.

  

Thanking you
