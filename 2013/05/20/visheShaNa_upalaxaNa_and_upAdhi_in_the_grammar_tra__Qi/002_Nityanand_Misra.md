Thanks a lot Prof. Korada and Prof. S P Narang for your responses. I will go through the Vakyapadiya and Shekhara references now and will try to procure Ramanuja Tatacharya's works. I have seen the Mahabhashya - Pradipa - Uddyota on this, and hopefully the other sources will have more in-depth treatment of the subjects.
