Dear scholars  
  
I am looking for references on विशेषण, उपलक्षण and उपाधि in the grammar tradition. The terms have been used in Ashtadhyayi and Mahabhashya - I would like to know of any works which treat these concepts in detail.  
  
PS: The words have different meanings in Nyaya, Vedanta and other traditions - I am only looking for the references for the above concepts in Vyakarana.  
  
Thanks, Nityanand
