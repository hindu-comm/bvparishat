Hariḥ AUM!



sarvebhyo namaskāraḥ ,



While blessing young married couple we often say "Patināruṁ Petru Peru Vāzhvu Vāzhka" in Tamil, meaning "My you get all the16 types of wealth".



Is there a samskritam equivalent like this which talks of "ṣodasa saṁpattiḥ" ?



If so, what are the 16 types of wealth referred to?
