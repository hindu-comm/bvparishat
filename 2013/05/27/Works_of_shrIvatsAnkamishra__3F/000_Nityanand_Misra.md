Dear scholars

  

I am looking for information on works (both print and digital format) ofŚrīvatsāṅkamiśra of the Viśiṣṭādvaita school. I have read on some webpages that he wrote five Stotras, but the sources are not reliable and I have been unsuccessful while searching for digital editions on DLI, Archive and Google Books.

  

If the works are not available in digital format, does somebody know if the following Vasantatilaka is by Śrīvatsāṅkamiśra, and if so, from which work?

  

ईदृग्गुणाननुबभूविथ राघव त्वं(?) यस्तावकं सुचरितं सकृदन्वभुङ्क्त।

सोऽत्रैव हन्त हनुमान् परमां विमुक्तिं बुद्ध्वा विधूत(?)चरितं तव सेवतेऽसौ॥

  

Thanks, Nityanand
