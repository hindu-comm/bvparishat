Dear Scholars,

In Chapter 101 of Brihat Samhita titled nakshatra-jaataka, Utapla in his commentary quotes Paraashara in verse form. This is about the character of persons born under particular nakshatras. An example for Ashvini is:

  

विज्ञानवनरोगो भिषक् प्रदातार्थभृत्यवनितेशः \|

दक्षः क्षितिपतिसेवी जातः स्यादाश्विने शूरः \|\|

  

These do not appear to be from the Paraashara-tantra which as quoted by Utpala is in prose. I could not locate the above verses in the Brhat-paraashara-hora. Can some one help me find the original source of the 25 shlokas attributed to Paraashara by Utpala?

  

Thanks

  

RN Iyengar
