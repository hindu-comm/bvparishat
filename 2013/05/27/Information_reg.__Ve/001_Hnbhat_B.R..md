I don't think it is much ancient origin. It has taken different shapes in different pages, according to their taste:

  

भाषासु मुख्या मधुरादिव्या गीर्वाणभारती।

तस्यां हि काव्यं मधुरं तस्मादपि सुभाषितम्॥  

  

seems to be the original सुभाषित found in many compilations of सुभाषित-s without any specific origin as given in Viki page.

  

The second half has changed differently in different pages:

  

तस्माद्धि काव्यम् मधुरं तस्मादपि ...  

  

तस्यां हि काव्यं मधुरं तस्मादपि ...  

  

तस्माद्भिः काव्यं मधुरं तस्मादपि  

  

etc.
