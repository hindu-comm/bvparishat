Dr. Nicholas Kazanas, the Greek professor who has torn to pieces the much discredited AIT, does not need any introduction to this forum. His credentials, as not an Indologist but as a revered scholar of Rg Veda, is beyond suspect and the forum members may be aware of his last visit to chennai in 2011 when he delivered the following lectures and interview in Chennai, Feb. 26, 2011 to March 3, 2011, which were appreciated by one and all:

1\. The collapse of Aryan Invasion Theory and the prevalence of Indigenism. Lecture delivered on 26 Feb. 2011 by Nicholas Kazanas at IIT, Madras  
2. All inclusiveness of the Rigveda. Lecture delivered by Nicholas Kazanas in Madras University, March 1, 2011 Consistent with the prevalence of indigenism in saptasindhu region, and preservation principle, Rigveda has remarkable features which make it the earliest human document with all inclusive linguistic features, some of which are paralleled in isoglosses and I-E linguistic area.  
3. Vedic civilization. Vedic scholar Nicholas Kazanas' lecture in Chennai, DG Vaishnav College, February 28, 2011.  
4. Nicholas Kazanas, Vedic scholar interviewed by S. Kalyanaraman -- In Chennai on 1 March 2011. In Chennai on 1 March 2011, the interview covered a wide range of issues related to vedic civilization, sprachbund (language union or linguistic area), indian ocean community and vedic studies
