Subhendu Mahodaya  
  
You may also refer the Chandralekha Hindi commentary by Pandit Ishwarchandra (Chowkhambha Sanskri Pratishthan, 2004, Part I, page 423) where also वनः has been marked as "6.1" (षष्ठी).  
  
What Vamana-Jayaditya, Bhattoji Dikshita and Jnanendra Saraswat have explained may be written as "वनः (5.1) ङीप् (1.1) \[तस्य (6.1) वनः (6.1)\] र (1.1) च (indeclinable)" with the अध्याहार of "तस्य वनः", hence explaining as पञ्चमी from वनः.  
  
Whether one considers अध्याहार, वाक्यद्वय, योगविभाग or विभक्तिपरिणाम, the षष्ठी is required for the आदेश.  
  
Thanks, Nityanand
