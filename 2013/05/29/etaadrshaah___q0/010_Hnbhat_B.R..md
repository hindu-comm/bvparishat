Mr. Jagannath has been rightly understood by Prof. Bhattacharya, but missed something and he corrected in in his last sentence the real expression in the phrase: नैतादृशः - not all clouds are like this (one which fullfils your demand for water present before it). This aspect of the pronoun is presented in this often quoted verse:

  

  

"इदमस्तु सन्निकृष्टं समीपतरवर्ति चैतदो रूपम् । अदसस्तु विप्रकृष्टं तदिति परोक्षे विजानीयात् ॥"  

  

The cloud nearer to the speaker/hearer is demonstrated and the noun need not be present in the same verse or in the preceding verse. It can be present in the mind in the poet himself who conceived the context for grammatical construction.

  

The structure suggested by Ramanujanएकादृश शब्दः स्यात्is not feasible for grammatical reasons, as the formation is from the pronouns only that the verb दृश्with the suffixes kan, orकञ् orक्विन् is formed and not from any other words or any other verb or with any other pronouns than those included in the group त्यदादि. एष इव पश्यति एतादृश,is the कृद्वृत्ति for the word usually offered by the commentators. Hence

  

I missed this discussion. Thanks all for their contribution to this thread.
