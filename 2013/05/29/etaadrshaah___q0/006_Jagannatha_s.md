Wonderful. Sri Dipak Bhattacharyaji, you got my point correctly. Thank you very much for citing the previous verse. Even this verse is very beautiful.Now the meaning of*etaadrshaah*became crystal clear.

  

I am grateful to Sri Nityanandaji for grammatical elaboration.

I thank Sri Srinivas Varakhedivarya for his response.

I thank Dr.Ramanujanvarya for his opinion. But his sentence

मम अभिप्राये एकरूपत्वार्थे एकादृश शब्दः स्यात् चेत् तदा इष्टसिद्धिः सुकरा स्यात् । cintyam iti pratibhaati \|  

Sri Nityanandaji, thank you very much for more references.  

By the bye, Nirnayasagar press edition of Shatakatraya(with commentary Sahrdayanandini by Ramachandrabudhendra (Sixth ed.1922.ed.Vasudevasharma Panashikar) does not contain these verses.  

  

S.J.
