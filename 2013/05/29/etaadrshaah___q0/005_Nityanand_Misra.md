Thanks for pointing this out. I did not pay attention to the context in which the word is used.

In the copy of **nītiśataka** that I have (Ed. with Sanskrit commentary by M R Kale, MLBD, ISBN 81-208-0642-5), the "re re cātaka" verse is number 51. The preceding verse is  
  
tameva cātakādhāro'sīti keṣāṁ na gocaraḥ  
kimambhodavarāsmākaṁ kārpaṇyoktiṁ pratīkṣase  
  
The commentary (p. 22 of the book) on एतादृशाः goes "ये कार्पण्योक्तिं प्रतीक्षेरन्. यद्वा ये दातारो न भवन्ति ". Kale's explanatory note (page 187) goes "एतादृशाः - such referring to चातकाधार in the above (previous) śloka. Although the ślokas are not much connected with each other still the poet allows the ellipsis to remain because it is easy to supply it."
