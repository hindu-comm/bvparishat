Shreemanto Dipakbhattaachaaryavaryaah, svasti \|

  

You are correct sir. I found both verses in SubhashitaRatnaBhandagara..According to index, the verse ***re re chaataka*** etc-- is from Bhartrhari-Subhashita-Sangraha [ed.by](http://ed.by) Kosambi.(Shri Nityanandamishravarya has already informed that this verse is available in M.R.Kale's edition of Nitishataka).The verse ***yah krishnam*** etc-- is taken from
ShaarngadharaPaddhati. Printed text reads ***dharaniim*** in the place of***vasudhaam***in the third quarter.of first verse(I had
heard***vasudhaam***)
