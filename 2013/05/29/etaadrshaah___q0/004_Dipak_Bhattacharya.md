Nityanandaji discusses the Pāṇinian formation of the word. But Jagannathaji's question was not on the grammatical formation but on the meaning ie syntactical connection of the word **** *etādṛśāḥ*. He asked *etādṛśāḥ* *ity asya ko’rthaḥ*. Apparently his intention was as follows:

*etādṛśāḥ* ‘like this’ demands a correlate that is to say the noun relating to the anaphoric ‘this’. The sentence speaks of various types of clouds asserting at the beginning ‘none is like this’. That ‘this’is missing in the verse. Hence Jagannathji’s question on the significance.

The noun meant by ‘this’ occurs in its preceding verse describing a rainwater-carrying cloud which has not been quoted by Jagannathaji along with the cited verse. The previous verse is

*yaḥ kṛṣṇaṃ kurute mukhaṃ janayati trāsaṃ taḍidbhistu yo*

*yaś ca prārthayate paraṃ dalayati śrotraṃ nijair garjitaiḥ/*

*satyaṃ cātaka taṃ tathāvidham api bhrātas tvayā yācatā *

*jīmūtaṃ kṛtam eva tulyam anayor arthitvatiryaktvayoḥ//*



Obviously, it is meant that all clouds are not like this
