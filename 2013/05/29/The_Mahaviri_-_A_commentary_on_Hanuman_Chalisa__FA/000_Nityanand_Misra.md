उद्यच्चण्डकराभभव्यभुवनाभ्यर्चाप्रदीप्तं वपु-  
र्बिभ्रन्मञ्जुलमौञ्जसूत्रमनघं घर्मघ्नकान्तस्मितम्।

(Mahāvīrī, Introduction of)  

  
I am pleased to inform BVP members that the Mahāvīrī commentary on the Hanuman Chalisa is now available for online reading. The link and some verses follow the brief introduction below. Please forward this to all Hanuman Bhaktas who may be interested.  
  
The **Mahāvīrī** is a *Laghuvyākhā* (small commentary) in Hindi on the Hanuman Chalisa of Gosvāmī Tulasīdāsa. The Mahāvīrī was composed by my Gurudeva, then known as Ācārya Giridharalāla Miśra Prajñācakṣu, in Vaiśākha, Vikrama Saṃvat 2040 (May 1983). The work was composed when he was on a visit to Choudwar, in Cuttack district of Odisha state, for the Prāṇapratiṣṭhā of Saṃkaṭamocana Hanumān temple. In Chowdwar, his Guru, Śrī Śrī 108 Śrī Rāmacaraṇadāsa Phalāhārī of Prayāga, ordered him to compose a minor commentary on the Hanuman Chalisa to benefit millions of Hindus who recite it daily, lamenting that there was no scholarly exposition available so far on the Chalisa.  
  
Obeying his Guru's orders, Gurudeva started the spontaneous dictation of the commentary on Vaiśākha Śukla Pratipadā V.S. 2040 (Friday, May 13 1983) and the dictation was complete on the next day i.e. Vaiśākha Śukla Dvitīyā V.S. 2040 (Saturday, May 14 1983). Owing to lack of funds, the commentary was unpublished for one year, and was finally published on the day of Ganga Dussehra, V.S. 2041 (June 8 1984), by the Krishnadas Charitable Trust in New Delhi. By the time it was published, Gurudeva had taken Virakta Dīkṣā (Bairagi initiation) from Śrī Śrī 108 Śrī Rāmacaraṇadāsa Phalāhārī in November 1983, and was now known as Rāmabhadradāsa. Gurudeva writes in the introduction to the work that it was perhaps the composition of this commentary on Hanuman Chalisa which bestowed on him the fortune of becoming a Virakta and being called by the name Rāmabhadradāsa.  
  
The commentary offers meanings of difficult words, a simple meaning and an exposition along with esoteric insights for the 43 verses of the Hanuman Chalisa. There are Pramāṇas from many scriptures including Upaniṣads, Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Mahābhārata, Bhāgavatam, Purāṇas, Vyākaraṇa, Nyāya, Yoga, and as many as nine works of Gosvāmī Tulasīdāsa. The commentary was called the "best commentary on Hanuman Chalisa" by the late Dr. Ram Charan Prasad of Patna, author of English and Hindi commentaries on the Śrīrāmacaritamānasa (Motilal Banarsidass, ISBN 978-81-208-0443-2, 1991, p. 849).  
  
As the book has been long out of print and unavailable for purchasing, the commentary has been digitized and published in Unicode by volunteers of Shri Tulsi Peeth Seva Nyas, Chitrakoot, with the blessings of Gurudeva. Some minor changes have been made from the 1983 text in accordance with the critical edition of Hanuman Chalisa edited by Gurudeva in 2004.  
  
The commentary can be read online under this link - <http://jagadgururambhadracharya.org/works/hcm/contents.php>  
  
The verses of Maṅgalācaraṇa (two Upajātis and one Śikhariṇī in Saṃskṛta and one Mattagajendra Savaiya in Awadhi which gives the date when the work was started) are as follows -  
  

तापिच्छनीलं धृतदिव्यशीलं ब्रह्माद्वयं व्यापकमव्ययञ्च।  
राजाधिराजं विशदं विराजं सीताभिरामं प्रणमामि रामम्॥ १ ॥  
सीतावियोगानलवारिवाहः श्रीरामपादाब्जमिलिन्दवर्यः।  
दिव्याञ्जनाशुक्तिललामभूतः स मारुतिर्मङ्गलमातनोतु॥ २ ॥  
गुरून्नत्वा सीतापतिचरणपाथोजयुगलं  
चिरञ्चित्ते ध्यात्वा पवनतनयं भक्तसुखदम्।  
गिरं स्वीयां दुष्टां विमलयितुमेवार्यचरितै-  
र्महावीरीव्याख्यां विरचयति बालो गिरिधरः॥ ३ ॥  
श्रीगुरुदेव गजानन मारुति आरति नाशिनि गौरि गिरीशा।  
जानकि जीवन मारुतनन्दन पंकज पायन नाइके शीशा।  
माधव शुक्ल शुभा परिवा तिथि भार्गववार प्रभातगवीशा।  
संवत बीस शताधिक चालिस व्याख्या करी हनुमानचालीसा॥ ४ ॥

  
The Chappaya in Awadhi at the end gives the date when the work was completed and also mentions Chowdwar and Odisha (Utkala Desha), where the work was composed  
  

सुमिरि राम सिय चरन कमल गुरु पद रज शिर धरि।  
चौद्वार उत्कल थल मारुतसुतहि ध्यान करि।  
संवत नभ फल ख दृग सुमाधव शिव शनिवारा।  
शुक्ल दूज हनुमान चालीसा मति अनुसारा।  
जुगुति शास्त्र सिद्धान्तमय वैष्णव रीति भगति भरी।  
नाम महावीरी ललित लघु व्याख्या गिरिधर करी॥
