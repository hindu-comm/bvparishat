Hello Sowmya,  
  
I have seen manuscripts of this commentary at the Bhandarkar Institute in Pune. Professor James Benson at Oxford University was working on a critical edition of this commentary. I have seen the initial portion of this critical edition which was presented at a conference at Oxford.
