Sir,

In my humble submission, I endorse the above views expressed by Vidwan HNBhat ji.

Effect of chanting a mantra is accepted by modern science also as explained by Bruce Lipton in 'The biology of Belief' . But this will bring about the change only in the individual that chants. For the change to be brought in more than one individual a combined chanting will be necessary. This a very common system in large group chanting sessions. For bringing about amiability among a husband and wife team, it will be a precondition that they develop and share the temperaments to bring about an atmosphere of amity and sit to chant together.

With my Pranams to all ,
