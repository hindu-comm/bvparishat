Dear Venkateshji,  
  

Can you please let me know which Durga-sahasranama stotra and the phalashruti you are referring to? There are three Durga / Parvati sahasranamas. It will be the best if you can enclose a copy of the Durga-sahasranama and the Phalashruti you are referring to.  
  

There is the story that when Rukmini found that Lord Krishna did not arrive she was distressed and she prayed to mother Parvati and immediately thereafter she found the Lord before her in the door of that temple. In the eastern India we bless a married couple saying that let Hara-Gauri be with them. Thus Gauri or Parvati is known to bless the married couple. There is also a custom that newly married couple should see Vesishtha and Arundhati, for having a happy married life.  
  
There are also some non-mantric remedies. One such remedy is that the lady should use Neem-water (i.e., water boiled with Neem leaves in it) or with Sarvaushadhi (a mixture of herbs) for bath. May be, in the modern times, a Neem-soap can be used in place of Neem -water. Neem is known to improve skin conditions. Sarvaushadhi probably pacifies the viruddha grahas.  
  

Regards,  

Sunil KB.
