Pranams to all,  
  
In 'Advaita Bodha Dipika' with English translation published by Sri Ramanashram, it is mentioned that the book was originally written in Sanskrit by Karapatra Swami. It is mentioned in many other places that the author, Karapatra Swami was the same as Swami Hariharananda Saraswati (1905-1980) who was well-known as Karapatra Swami or Karapatri Maharaj.  

  

At the same time, I find that Tamil editions of Advaita Bodha Dipika were published as early as 1887 (which are available at DLI). This makes me believe that the author of Advaita Bodha Dipika must someone else with the same name.  
  
Any information on the identity of the author of this book will be highly appreciated.



regards  
shankara
