The verse is the 66th in the सुभाषितरत्नमाला No.2 'with English and MaraThi notes' by Keshav Ganesh Chipnolkar, published in Kolhapur in 1912.   
  
In order to put it in the post I searched in the net and found it here:  
  
<http://susanskrit.org/sanskrit-subhashit-good-company.html>  
  
But I found it contained several mistakes which I corrected but missed one or two.  
  
See if there is any popular kAvya source of this verse.
