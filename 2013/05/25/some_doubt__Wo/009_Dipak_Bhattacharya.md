Also to remember : It is not that the Aṣṭādhyāyī is meant for Classical Sanskrit only. Pāṇini gave rules for most of the special formations of the Vedas which formed the Vaidikaprakaraṇa of the Siddhānta Kaumudī.

It is to be noted that some Vedic occurrences are not mentioned in the Aṣṭādhyāyī. For example, the occurrence of the periphrastic perfect in Paippalāda-Saṃhitā 18.65.10 असून् पितृभ्यो गमयां चकर्थ and Śaunakīya-Saṃhitā 18.2.27 असून् पितृभ्यो गमयां चकार was missed by Pāṇini in 3.1.35 कास्प्रत्ययादाममन्त्रे लिटि. From this some Western scholars have jumped to wrong conclusion about Pāṇini’s relation with the Atharvaveda. The reason for this omission has been discussed by me.

Best wishes for all

You are so right. Panini came much after the times of the Vedas and even after Vedavyasa and his disciples classified the four Vedas and made the rest of the Vedic literature as the fifth Veda. More than 1,300 years after that was the time of Lord Buddha and further 500 years later came
Asvaghosha and Nagarjuna. Only thereafter came Panini. Therefore Panini's recommendation should strictly applies only to classical sanskrit and not Vedic Sanskrit. I think all Sanskrit scholars have to remember this at all times.
