Dear Friend,

  

When you ask your friends to give reference, please provide yourself enough reference for your question. Otherwise it is a waste of time for others to spend time on a unspecific question at random. For example, if you have examined the formation of the प्रक्रिया of विषण्ण in your second question, the question itself would not have rised.
