I beg to differ with Dr. Sunil Bhattacharjya. Even though Panini came millenia after Vedas and older works, his grammar is for Vedic and classical Sanskrit. Panini analyzed millions and millions of historical and current Shishta usages, and used merely 4000 brief rules to explain them. In statistical terms, he saw millions of data points in multiple-dimensions and fit a model that explained the variation with as few explanatory variables as possible. No grammar with finite rules can explain all of the infinitely many Shishta usages just as no statistical model with finite explanatory variables can explain all variation of infinitely many data points. The unparalleled genius of the superhuman Panini is that he explained millions of Shishta usages using very few rules and laid down guidelines for many millions (probably billions) of future Shishta usages.

  

At times, we are quick to say that Panini is not useful to interpret pre-Paninian works. But often, such so-called non-Paninian usages are Paninian in some way or other when we go in depth. A good reference in this context would be

  

Mishra, Giridhar (1981).Adhyātmarāmāyaṇe'pāṇinīyaprayogānāṃ Vimarśaḥ\[Deliberation on non-Paninian usages in the Adhyatma Ramayana\] (in Sanskrit). (Ph.D. Thesis). Varanasi, India: Sampurnanand Sanskrit University.  

  

It will be available soon for online reading. The work offers two or three and sometimes upto seven or eight valid Paninian solutions for around 350 so-called non-Paninian usages in Adhyātmarāmāyaṇa.
