Thanks, but मैथुन also listed as a word for विवाह (e.g. Apte Sanskrit-Hindi Kosh, MLBD, 1989 edition, page 819).  
  
There is no commentary on the work, so I am not sure if अष्ट मैथुन in the verse refers to the अष्टविवाह as per Manusmriti or अष्टमैथुन as per वैराग्यमार्त्तण्ड (or maybe both by श्लेष).
