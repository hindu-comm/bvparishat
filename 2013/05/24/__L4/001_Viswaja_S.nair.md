Respected Rana Sir,  
I'm viswaja S. Nair, Research scholar, SSUS Kalady.  
as I knew about the last issue notification of Dheemahi, I send an article for that journal, and contact to Sheeba.V, ass.director for the same.  
But your crew didn't gave any reply, positively or negatively. What is the status of that paper sir?  

  

Thank You Sir,  

Viswaja S.Nair.
