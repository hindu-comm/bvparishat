Dear Bhattacharyaji,

  

Could you please tell the exact verse in Bhagavad Gita that says so? I could only find a related verse 7.23, which states that alpa-medha worship the demigods.

  

antavat[tu](http://vedabase.net/t/tu)[phalaḿ](http://vedabase.net/p/phalam)[teṣāḿ](http://vedabase.net/t/tesam)

[tad](http://vedabase.net/t/tad)bhavaty[alpa](http://vedabase.net/a/alpa)-[medhasām](http://vedabase.net/m/medhasam)

[devān](http://vedabase.net/d/devan)[deva](http://vedabase.net/d/deva)-yajo[yānti](http://vedabase.net/y/yanti)

mad-[bhaktā](http://vedabase.net/b/bhakta)[yānti](http://vedabase.net/y/yanti)[mām](http://vedabase.net/m/mam)[api](http://vedabase.net/a/api)

  

Men of small intelligence worship the demigods, and their fruits are limited and temporary. Those who worship the demigods go to the planets of the demigods, but My devotees ultimately reach My supreme planet.  

  

  

On the other hand, I could find a whole chapter in Srimad Bhagavat, Canto 11, Chapter 27, where Lord Krishna describes the process of Deity worship to Uddhava (<http://vedabase.net/sb/11/27/1/en>)

  

And relating to the exact point, the verse 11.27.15 states

  

[dravyaiḥ](http://vedabase.net/d/dravyaih)prasiddhair mad-[yāgaḥ](http://vedabase.net/y/yagah)

pratimādiṣv[amāyinaḥ](http://vedabase.net/a/amayinah)

[bhaktasya](http://vedabase.net/b/bhaktasya)[ca](http://vedabase.net/c/ca)[yathā](http://vedabase.net/y/yatha)-labdhair

[hṛdi](http://vedabase.net/h/hrdi)[bhāvena](http://vedabase.net/b/bhavena)caiva[hi](http://vedabase.net/h/hi)

  

One should worship Me in My Deity forms by offering the most excellent paraphernalia. But a devotee completely freed from material desire may worship Me with whatever he is able to obtain, and may even worship Me within his heart with mental paraphernalia.  

  

Please note that it doesn't say that only a neophyte class of people performs deity worship but it says that an elite (highly advanced) class of people ***may even*** worship Him within their heart with mental paraphernelia.

  

  

Thank you very much.

  

Regards

Pawan
