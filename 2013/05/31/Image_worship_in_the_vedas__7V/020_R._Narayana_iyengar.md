Namaste!

  

Image worship and Aagamas are closely linked. I found the English and Sanskrit Introduction in the Paramasamhita-PAncarAtrAgama (Baroda Oriental Inst. 1940) to be very well written.

It is not only the Vedic statements referring to "Pratima" that become interesting. The BhAgavata cult appears to have originated out of SAtvatas who were in some sense connected with the Purus and Bharatas of RV. It is claimed RV (1.25.13, 2.33.9, 8.69.12, 10.155.3) refer to 'Images' for adoration. SayaNa explains the last hymn above

  

अदो यद्दारु प्लवते सिन्धोः पारे अपूरुषं

  

as

  

पुरुषोत्तमाख्यं देवताशरीरं ....

  

Atharva-parishisTa, if considered as representing Vedic practices, prescribes metal and other objects for Graha-worship.
