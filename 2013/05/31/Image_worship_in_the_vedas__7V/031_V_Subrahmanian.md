Sir,  
  
Is there not the root 'yaj pUjAyAm' ? In the mantra 'trayambakam yajAmahe sugandhim....' is it pUja or yajna? Will anyone help by providing the standard commentary for clarification?  
  
In the mundakopanishat we have this mantra:  
  
Yam yam lokam manasaa samvibhaati.  
Vishuddhasatwah kaamayate yaamshcha kaamaan.  
Tam tam lokam jayate taamshcha kaamaam-.  
stasmaadaatmajnam *hyarchayed*bhootikaamah \[3.1.10\]  
  
For this word shankaracharya comments:
पूजयेत्पादप्रक्षालनशुश्रूषास्कारादिभिः....  
One might say that the upanishad is a later addition. But the traditionalist do not hold that view.  
  
  
warm regards
