Yes. Even though the deities were worshipped they used to get the offerings (made to them) through Agni, who is like their mouth. Agni is the presiding deity of the Krittika nakshatra and that also was probably the reason why Krittikadi system was followed in the early Vedic times. Further Krittikma, due to being considered to be in the East, all Yajnas were performed facing the East. The image-worship was as we see now was a later development.
