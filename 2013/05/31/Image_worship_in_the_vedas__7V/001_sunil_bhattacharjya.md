Shankaraji,  
  

After reading what the Paripurna Brahman Lord Krishna himself told Arjuna I did not feel the need to look for any other reference on the Image-worship. Lord Krishna said that the image worship is for the alpabuddhinam (i.e. obviously for the beginners in the spiritual journey). He said that the Samadarshis see God everywhere.
