Dear Pawan Goyalji,  
  

I presume you are talking about the verse " - - - Pratima Svalpabuddhinam Sarvatra Samadarshinam- - - ". In an earlier mail I gave the complete verse in Devanagari and hope you have seen that. In one Bengali book, which I read years ago, the relevant word is given as "alpabuddhiunam"  

  

This verse is from Uttara Gita 3.7. Gaudapada, generally considered to be the Parama-guru of Adi Shankara, wrote a commentary on the Uttara-Gita and that probably means that the Shankara-sampradaya do accept the text of Uttara-Gita. In this quoted verse the Lord says that the image worship is very much there for the alpabuddhinam i.e. the beginners but the Samadarshin (the real Jnanis) see God everywhere and that means the Samadarshis do not need to worship God in the image. The Veda are Apara-Vidya and the Vedanta is Para-Vidya. The Lord could mean that one who has attained the Para-Vidya or the Vedantic jnana, need not have to worship Pratima.  
  

My understanding is that it is also generally believed that the Murti /idol worship is more a Tantric practice rather than a Vedic practice and even in the ancient times both the Agamas and the Nigamas were considered important Shastras. Sanjaya at the end of the Bhagavad Gita clearly says that in the Bhagavad Gita the Lord had given the knowledge of both the Agamas and the Nigamas.  
  

Regards,
