There are broadly two types of worship - the worship of the formless and attribute less Brahmam and worship with form and attributes which may be considered as idol or image worship.  
  
In BhagavadGita, ch. 2 to 11 the Lord glorifies at various places the worship of God with form and attributes. Although the worshippers of both the qualified and absolute aspects of God are noble and praiseworthy in the eyes of Arjuna, he is anxious to know the relative worth and excellence of the two types of worhsipphers. This is what he seeks to elicit from the Lord through his question:  
  
 Evam satatayuktaaye ----
Sl. 1 Ch 12  
  
In reply to the above question of Arjuna, the Lord gives His verdict in favor of the worshippers of God with attributes.  
  
 Mayyavesya mano ye maam ---
Sl. 2 Ch.12  
  
Sri Bhagavan said : I consider them to be the best Yogis, who endowed with supreme faith, and ever united through meditation with Me i.e., God with attributes, worship Me with the mind centered on Me.

maanyaa:

I have read in a book by Sri Karpangadu Venkatacharya this sloka as follows:



agnau tiShThati viprANAm hRuditiShThati yoginAm \|

pratimAsvaprabuddhAnAm sarvatra samadarshinAm \|\|



He says for this 3rd quarter, Yamunacharya has commented as 'aprabuddhAnAmapi'.
