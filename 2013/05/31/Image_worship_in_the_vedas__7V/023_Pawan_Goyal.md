Dear Bhattacharyaji,

  

Thank you for confirming that the verse was not from Bhagavad Gita. And just from reading the chapter 11.27 in Srimad Bhagavatam, I am convinced that deity worship is not a "Tantric" practice. Of course, you can always have different opinions regarding that.

  

Thank you again.

  

Regards

Pawan
