This discussion seems to focus on texts that are not really the Veda.
The most obvious reference to images in the Veda is in RV 4.24.10. Here is the text and the translation:  
  
क इमं दशभिर्मेमेन्द्रं क्रीणाति धेनुभिः ।  
यदा वृत्राणि जङ्घनदथैनं मे पुनर्ददत् ॥ ४.२४.१०॥  
  
Who will purchase this Indra of mine for ten cows? When this Indra has succeeded in slaying the vritras (enemies), let (the buyer) return this Indra to me.  
  
Here "this Indra" is obviously a reference to an image of Indra. This clearly indicates that there was a practice (although may not have been widespread) of using images to secure favors. Whether the images were worshipped and if so, in what manner, is not clear. Furthermore the reference to returning the image indicates that the payment is for a rent and not a purchase. (The author, Vamadeva, might have been desperately in need of funds...)  
  
Sayana quotes some interesting shlokas form the tradition in his commentary on 4.24.9, the rik previous to this one, and I would recommend that your read it. It includes the following shloka:  
  
वामदेवो वशीकृत्य शक्रं स्तोत्रेण भूयसा ।  
विक्रीणन् समयं चक्र इन्द्रं क इममित्यृचि ॥
