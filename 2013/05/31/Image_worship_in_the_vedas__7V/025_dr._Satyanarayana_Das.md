sarvatra samadarshinam - God is every where for samadarshis. So He is also in Pratima. Sarvatra includes Pratima. Why would a samadarshi not see God in Pratima. If he/she can not see then he/she is not a samadarshi. One meaning of tasya pratima nasti is that God does not have statue which non-hindus think a deity to be. God has a vigraha. He is personally present in His vigraha or Murti unlike a statue.
