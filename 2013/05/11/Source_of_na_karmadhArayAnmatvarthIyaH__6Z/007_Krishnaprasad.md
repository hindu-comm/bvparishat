It is from vamana's Kavyalankara sutra vrtti. Sutra by Vamana

and also quoted by Charudeva Sastry in his Sabdapasabda viveka page  
234 while rectifying nivrttadehaabhimaaninaH as nivrttadehaabhimanaaH  
but little variant is there in the vamana's sutra  
And in Kumarasambhava there is no commentary for 14th canto by  
Mallinatha
