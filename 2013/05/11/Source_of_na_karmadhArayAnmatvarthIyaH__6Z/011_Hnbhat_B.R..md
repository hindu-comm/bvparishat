The exact phrase of KavyalankarfasUtravRitti is this:

  

  

न कर्मधारयो बहुव्रीहिप्रतिपत्तिकरः ॥ ५..१..७॥

बहुव्रीहिप्रतिपत्तिं  

करोति यः कर्मधारयः,

स न प्रयोक्तव्यः।

  

तेन विपर्ययो व्याख्यातः॥ ५..१..८॥

बहुव्रीहिरपि कर्मधारयप्रतिपत्तिकरो  

न प्रयोक्तव्यः।

  
Except the above two sUtra-s, there is no direct mention of the न कर्मधारयान् मत्वर्थीयः।

  

which is quoted in several other commentaries also, in similar contexts having मत्वर्थीय after कर्मधारय.The verbatim quotation in दुर्घटवृत्ति is not the source for the निषेध, as the वृत्ति is just like the last chapter of काव्यालंकारसूत्रवृत्ति dealing with rare usages seemingly opposed to or opposed to पाणिनि-s शब्दसंस्कार and hence it is not an independent वृत्ति like काशिका, or its sub commentaries.

  

I have not seen the व्याकरणचन्द्रोदय which is a recent 19th century work. If he gives the original source for the quotation, it is welcome. If the discussion on the quotation, please produce the relevant page or the source therein or the guist of the discussion therein may be given.

  

In short, the source of the quotation is yet to be traced which is quoted in Durghatta also among the later grammarians.
