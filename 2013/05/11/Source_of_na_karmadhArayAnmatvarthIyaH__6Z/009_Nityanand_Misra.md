Thanks Sh. Krishnaprasad for tracing this to Vamana's Kavyalankara Sutra Vritti -  

  
"It is from vamana's Kavyalankara sutra vrtti. Sutra by Vamana  
  
and also quoted by Charudeva Sastry in his Sabdapasabda viveka page 234 while rectifying nivrttadehaabhimaaninaH as nivrttadehaabhimanaaH  
but little variant is there in the vamana's sutra  
And in Kumarasambhava there is no commentary for 14th canto by Mallinatha  
  

it is also explained vyakarana chandrodaya 2nd volume page 433 by charudeva sastry"  
  

I will refer the texts and get back to you. And you are right, Mallinatha has not commented on the so-called 14th canto of Kumarasambhavam, I do not know who this commentary is by - [http://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/कुमारसम्भवम्\_-\_मल्लिनाथः/चतुर्दशः\_सर्गः](http://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/कुमारसम्भवम्_-_मल्लिनाथः/चतुर्दशः_सर्गः)
