That should read "is **NOT** to be traced to theदुर्घटवृत्ति on ... but in the commentary called विवृति of ...". :) If something is not in the Ashtadhyayi but is in the Mahabhashya, one cannot say "it can be traced to Ashtadhyayi but in the Mahabhashya on Ashtadhyayi".

  

On page 323 of fifth part (Taddhita Prakarana) of Bhaimi commentary on LSK (First edition, Bhaimi Prakashan, Delhi, 1991), Bhimasena Sastri ascribes the quote to the "Bhashya". He writes न कर्मधार्यान्मत्वर्थीयो बहुव्रीहिश्चेत्तदर्थप्रतिपत्तिकरः (भाष्ये). Assuming Mahabhashya is meant here, this may occur in some manuscript of Mahabhashya which Bhimasena Sastri had access to.  

  

At the same time, the statement is called वामनवचन by Charudeva Shastri in Vyakarana Candrodaya. This could either point to वामन of the Kavyalankara Sutra Vritti or maybe to theवामन-जयादित्य duo of Kashika - it is believed that one of them produced the first half and the other the second.

  

I would have taken the word of Charudeva Shastri but then the word of another stalwart (Bhimasena Shastri) contradicts it. Given this situation, and having not seen any edition or manuscript of Mahabhashya/Kashika/Vamana with this exact tatement, I am leaving this uncited for now in my edited text.

  

Thanks, Nityanand
