Dr. Kannan  
  
Thanks, but I could not find the statement in Durghatavritti 2.1.51. I referred the edition which was edited by Mm. T. Ganapati Sastri (1942, Trivandrum Sanskrit Series No. VI., DLI Barcode 2020010008571) and the Vritti on 2.1.51 goes -  
  
तद्धितार्थोत्तरपदसमाहारे च  
  
कथं पञ्चगुः पुरुषः. उच्यते. तद्धितार्थे मत्वर्थे नेष्यते. अनभिधानात्पञ्चगुरिति रक्षितः.  
  
And that is all on 2-1-51. Could you please let me know which edition you are referring to? Or if it is under some other Sutra?  
  
Thanks, Nityanand
