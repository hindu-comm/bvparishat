Dr. Kannan and Dr. Krishnaprasad  
  
I referred the Kavyalankara Sutravritti (Nirnay Sagar Press Kavyamala Series 15, edited by Mm. Durgaprasad and Kashinatha Panduranga Parab, year 1926). In this edition, the statement from 5-2-59 is what Dr. Bhat has quoted - कर्मधारयान्मत्वर्थीयानुपपत्तिः.  
  
Unfortunately, this is not the quote I was looking for, though it is similar. The source for "न कर्मधारयान्मत्वर्थीयः" \[बहुव्रीहिश्चेत्तदर्थ\[प्रत्यय\]करः\] is still unknown to me. Jnanendra Saraswati has used "इति" which shows he is clearly quoting from some source -  
  
एकदेशशब्दोऽवयवे रूढः. अत एव तस्य कर्मधारयत्वेऽपि ततो मत्वर्थीयः. 'कृष्णसर्पवान्' इत्यत्रेव 'न कर्मधारयान्मत्वर्थीयः' इति निषेधस्य रूढेष्वप्रवृत्तेः.  
  
Dr. Krishnaprasad, can you please confirm the edition of Vamana's Vritti you are referring and whether it has a different reading?
