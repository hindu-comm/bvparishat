It is already available in the काव्यमाला Edition available for download in DLI in the link I had already given in the Index page from 1-12 and indicated in the Introduction portion of the same book by the Editors:

Just you can go through the 1-12 pages and locate the verses indexed with sources named in the text as हालस्स like this:

This does not need any fresh research as you had anticipated, but just download and open the काव्यमाला Edition. In case you have any doubt, about its authenticity, further research need be undertaken. Whether this was noted by Hala himself, as हालस्स. Anyhow I didn't count the numbers of Indexed verses. hoping you will find to count them whether it comes to 44 number you have given.
