Dear friends,  
  

In the Sattaseei (composed in Maharashtri-Prakrt) there are said to be 44 verses by the Shatavahana king Hala himself. It is said that King Hala had profusely applauded the scholarship and bravery of king Vikramarka (Vikramaditya) in the Saattasaee. I was looking for those 44 verses in the book "Poems of life and love in ancient India (Hala Sattaasee)" translated from Prakrt by Peter Khoroche and Herman Tieken, but I could not find any verse (ascribed to Hala) except the solitary verse, which mentions Hala as given below :  
  

Among countless elegant poens,  

King Hala, patron of poets,  

Has selected seven hundred.  
  

I shall be grateful if any scholar give me the 44 verses.  
  

Regards,  

Sunil KB
