Namaste friends,  
  

This is to inform you that I have gone through the Gathasaptashatee (the Kavyamala version) and found mention of 47 (not 44) verses attributed to Hala and in none of them Vikramarka is mentioned. This means that Vikramarka could have been mentioned in the other 200 verses. out of the total 900 verses found by A.Weber. These 200 verses were obviously not considered by the editor of the Kavyamala version. This also means that there is scope for one to study this aspect as part of a research project.  
  

Regards,
