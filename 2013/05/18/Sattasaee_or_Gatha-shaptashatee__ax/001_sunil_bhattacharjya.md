It seems there is one particular edition of Gatha-saptashatee, where each and every contributor's name is mentioned against each and every verse. There could be scholars in India or abroad who may be aware of this source. Moreover I understand that some advanced courses of Sanskrit and Prakrt include the study of the Gatha-saptashatee. I hope I shall be able to get this help from some scholar. I do not want to undertake research on this due to my other preoccupations. Further there may not be any need to reinvent the wheel as some scholars might have already done the necessary research on this.
