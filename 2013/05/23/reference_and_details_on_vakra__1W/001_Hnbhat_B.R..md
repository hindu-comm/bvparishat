I can't understand what do you want to know. As the web page itself suggest, it gives the reference to some Editions of पुराण-s they have referred and are giving the reference to the books they have named Indexed alphabetically.

  

You may search in the Editions used by them, if you can know the Editions they have used for Indexing project. Otherwise you cannot get the referenced text online. Because each website would use the editions accessible to them and there need not be any uniformity. They have indexed the subjects in the पुराण-s they have given likeब्रह्मवैवर्त्त २.३०.१०७(वक्रता करनेv पर नरक में वक्रकुण्ड प्राप्ति का कथन) the subject given within the bracket. To get the text, you have to refer to the Edition of the पुराण they have used or look into any Edition of the पुराण available online or offline, and look into the subject Index or Contents for the subject indexed here.
