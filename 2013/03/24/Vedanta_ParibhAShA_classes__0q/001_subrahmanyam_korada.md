नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

This is good .

  

Kerala State Govt had sanctioned Rs 50,000/ for a Workshop on Textual Teaching (Bhusanasara - Dhatvarthanirnaya and Sphotanirnaya) for eight days for the Faculty across Kerala .

  

While Vidvan Narsimhamurti of Sringeri (Sanskrit Sansthan) taught Dhatvartha , I taught Sphota from 28 Jan to 4 Feb 2013 .

  

85 participants registered and due to strike 65 attended . 95% were ladies .

  

I may put the material of 50 pages from other systems that was supplied and taught .

  

धन्यो’स्मि
