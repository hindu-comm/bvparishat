In languages such as Hindi and Marathi at least, aava;syaka has acquired the sense of 'necessary, required'. This is a case of an easily understandable semantic development:  
  
ava;sya 'not within one's control' --> aava;syaka 'bound to happen/take place' --> 'absolutely needed/required' 'necessary'.  
  
If this semantic development had already taken place in Skt, especially of the second millennium A.D., needs to be ascertained.
