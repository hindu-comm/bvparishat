Namaste  
  
I am looking for *buying within India* or downloading the Haristuti (also known as 'HarimeeDe stotram')of Sankaracharya with the Sanskrit commentary 'Hari-tattva-muktavali' of Svayamprakasayati. There is another commentary, by Anandagiri, to this stuti.  
  
Any leads on the above title(s) in the Digital Library of India or other sources may please be provided.  
  
regards  
subrahmanian.v
