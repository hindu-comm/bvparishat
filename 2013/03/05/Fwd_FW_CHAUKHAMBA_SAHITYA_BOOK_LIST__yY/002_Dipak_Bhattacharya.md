Thanks! This is likely to be useful. The problem is when an order is placed it is not carried out properly by some publishers. Recently I sent an order for A.K.Warder's Indian Buddhism to a Delhi firm. They sent that along with a copy of Devadhar's Bhaasnaatakacakram which I had bought from them sometime ago. I did not know that. They had sent no prior communication. Naturally I paid twice for the same book.
