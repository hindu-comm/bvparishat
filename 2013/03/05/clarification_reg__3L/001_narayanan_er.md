Thanks for the inquiry. \[The term Prastaara originates from the root स्तॄञ् आच्छादने to hide, to cover, to arrange in क्र्यादिः-(स्तृणाति one hides, covers, arranges) with the preposition प्र and घञ् suffix making into prastaara. It gives the meanings of bed made of tender leaves and flowers, grassy field etc. But we are not discussing it here.\]  
It is a technical term in Sanskrit metres which differentiates the significances of one metre with another by following the allignments of syllables in terms of their weight. When we consider the Prakrit metres the criterion of Prastaara is important, in Prakrit it is Pathaara for Prastaara.  
It is of two types: वर्णप्रस्तारः (allignment according to the number of syllables) and मात्राप्रस्तारः (allignment according the weight of syllables).  
The Vrttaratnavali reads how the syllables are to be alligned:  
पादे सर्वगुरावाद्यात् लघु न्यस्य गुरोरधः। यथोपरि तथा शेषं भूयः कुर्यादमुं विधिम्॥ ऊने दद्याद् गुरूनेव यावत् सर्वलघुर्भवेत्। प्रस्तारोऽयं समाख्यातश्छन्दोविचितिवेदिभिः॥ When the whole foot is guru (heavy-the wieght increases in long vowels and due to the conjunction of consonants), arrange laghu (light syllables) below guru. The rest is to be practised as above. In lesser rows, it is to be supplied with guru, till the whole row becomes laghu. This Prastaara has been recommenced by the learned on the science of metre.  
The Prakrit verse says about पत्थार on the alignment according the weight of syllables is as follows:  
पढमं गुरु हेट्ट allign guru first  
ठाणे लहुआ परिठवउ अप्पबुद्धीए। then allign laghu in each place according to one's own intelligence.  
सरिसा सरिसा पन्ती similar similar rows  
उबरिआ गुरुलहू देहू॥ allign guru & laghu as above.  
This mail did not completely address the whole answer to the inquiry. The examples are to be taken into consideration. We will discuss this in details in following mails.  
Regards,  
Narayanan
