Yes, whatever metre we follow, their allignments are either according to the number of syllables or allignment according the weight of syllables. As Prastaara being the representation or enumeration of all the possible combinations of certain given numbers or of short and long syllables in a metre, your assumption seems to be correct. The grouping in the metres on the basis of number of syllables are done on the basis of guru-s and laghu-s in each trio of syllables make the gana (group) and those groups in order in each foot form the metre. This inherited from the Vedas, we see the rules in the Chandasshastra of Pingala, which is one of the Vedangas. The system of the versification seen in the Vedas, in Classical Sanskrit and in Prakrit the weight, number, grouping, stanzas with their homogeneity are being followed. This trend really inherits from the Vedas and no doubt, I feel, and scholars may correct me. Please read the following:

Moreover, trikalaprastaara etc. are to be understood from the Chandasshastra of Pingala.
