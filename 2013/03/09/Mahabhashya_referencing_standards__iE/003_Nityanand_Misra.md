Another question I had on this topic - what is the standard (if any) while citing बालमनोरमा, प्रौढमनोरमा and शब्दरत्न? Say what if I want to cite the exposition of हलन्त्यम् from प्रौढमनोरमा and शब्दरत्न?  
  
I would think that since they are all commentaries on the सिद्धान्तकौमुदी (SK), citing the सूत्रक्रम of सिद्धान्तकौमुदी makes sense. This is १ for हलन्त्यम् as is the first numbered Sutra in both SK and LSK which do not number the माहेश्वरसूत्रs.  
  
Citing Panini's Sutra number does not make sense for either SK or LSK I believe.
