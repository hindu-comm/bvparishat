Dear scholars  
  
I am editing a text which cites Mahabhashya many times sometimes as पस्पशाह्निके, द्वितीयाह्निके, et cetera and sometimes with the Panini Sutra number. I would like to add the complete citations for references from the Mahabhashya so that it is easier for the reader to locate the cited segments. What is the most common referencing style used for Mahabhashya?  
  
Ram Nath Sharma's commentary (in English) uses the style of Roman numeral for the आह्निक, followed by arabic numeral for paragraph. As per his style सिद्धे शब्दार्थसम्बन्धे in the पस्पशाह्निक is I:27.  
  
The GRETIL etext under <http://www.wilbourhall.org/pdfs/Mahabhashya.pdf> has three referencing styles -  

1.  Based on the Rohtak edition, (Ro Volume,page,line).
2.  Based on the Kielhorn-Abhayankar edition (KA Volume,page,line).  
3.  A third style which goes like Pas (for पस्पशाह्निक), Ś (for
    शिवसूत्र) and P (for पाणिनिसूत्र), followed by the paragraph. This
    seems different from the paragraph numbering used by Ram Nath
    Sharma, as सिद्धे शब्दार्थसम्बन्धे is Pas 10.1.

I would like to know if there are any other commonly used referencing styles and if there is any accepted standard in Sanskrit publications.  
  
Thanks, Nityanand
