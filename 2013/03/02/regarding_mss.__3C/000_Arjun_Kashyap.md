Dear Scholars, shirasa namami

          

           This is ARJUN KASHYAP from RSVP TIRUPATI. I am a research student in dept. of manuscriptology & paleography. I edited a ms. called 'gitagangadhara' of kalyana for my thesis. but it was my bad luck that it was lastly came to know it was published in 1987. And now i left it and started working again on commentary of " Subandhu's vasavadatta" named "SUKSHMADARSANA" . I gone through all terms and searched properly this time but it will be more clear if any of the scholars will give me any details of regarding .

                         DHANYOSMI
