I think the question is already replied pointing out to different sources and it is up to Mr.Venkatesh to chose proper source for his purpose, which he did not specify what kind of information he wants.

  

Ashtadhyayi as already mentioned is the source of all Paninian suffixes and Unadi- suffixes, listed in two recensions, in Five and Ten Pada-s versions, is a complete list. But need not be conclusive, as the rule for Unadi suffix, "उणादयो बहुलम्" is interpreted

  

बाहुलकंप्रकृतेस्तनुदृष्टेः प्रायसमुच्चयनादपि तेषाम्।

कार्यसशेषविधेश्च तदुक्तं नैगमरूढिभवं हि सुसाधु। 1।

नाम च धातुजमाह निरुक्ते व्याकरणे शकटस्य च तोकम्।

यन् न पदार्थविशेषसमुत्थं प्रत्ययतः प्रकृतेश्च तदूह्यम्। 2।

संज्ञासु धातुरूपाणि प्रत्ययाश्च ततः परे।

कार्याद् विद्यादनुबन्धम् एतच् छास्त्रम् उणादिषु। 3।

  

which requires as mentioned in the last word, from words used, one has to infer the suffixes, in Unadi. Even though it is not covered by Unadi list. and for this prior knowledge of the function of Paninian rules related to the kRit suffixes. Vacaspatya and Shabdakalpadruma gives the suffixes for the words listed in the alphabetical words, if the purpose is to identify the suffix forming any word.

  

Nityanantda has poined out a list in the preface of Vacaspatya of these three kind of suffixes. Marcis has pointed out online lists in many sites.

  

There is an alphabetical list of suffixes in alphabetical order with grammatical information (useful for those who know grammar generally) by Late Guande Rao Harkere, published in 1983.
