The best thing to do is to go through chapters 3-5 of the A.s.taadhyaayii with the Kaasikaa and the Nyaasa.  
Or, the Siddhaantakaumudii too may be helpful with the Baalamanoramaa or S.C.Vasu's translation.  
If a Western approach is sought to be known Macdonell's Vedic Grammar (not the one for students) will be helpful. But the Paninian niceties will not be found there. It will also be necessary to remember that 'suffix' and pratyaya are not the same thing.
