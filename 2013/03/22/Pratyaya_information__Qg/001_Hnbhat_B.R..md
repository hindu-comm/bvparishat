Here is a link in which you can find information regarding all the pratyaya-s:

  

<http://grammarofsanskrit.wordpress.com/2012/11/02/%E0%A4%AA%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%A4%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%AF%E0%A4%AF%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%83/>  

  

if you don't want to learn Vyakarana, but only information about pratyaya-s without learning Vyakarana. If you want, it is available in Ashtadhyayi, which available in many web pages with and without commentary and in siddhantakaumudi and other basic texts for the beginners of Sanskrit Grammar (and not for beginners of Sanskrit).
