I apologize in advance for the harsh words in this email, but this is important.  
  
The Wikipedia page on Doha is itself wrong in this example, which led to your misunderstanding. The latest edits on the Wikipedia page on Doha are done from a User account named "Vishvas_vasuki" as can be seen here -

Now assuming it is the same as you, you are not only wrong and know nothing about Awadhi prosody, but you are also editing Wikipedia articles on these topics to confuse the entire world. Not satisfied with that, now you are confusing members of BVP who are unaware of Awadhi. We should all bow down to this Sarasvata Upakara of yours on the entire world.  
  
Your latest edits show that 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 1 1 add up to 13, whereas any primary knows that 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 1 1 add up to 14. This shows that you do not even proofread or use a Sandbox before editing Wikipedia.  
  
Edits like these are the reason why no academic publication trusts Wikipedia.  
  
An example to learn for all those who take pride in citing Wikipedia and blogs on this scholarly forum.
