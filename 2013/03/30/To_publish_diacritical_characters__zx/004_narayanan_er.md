Respected Sir,  
I am not an expert in anything.  
What Shri. Srinivasan Acharya wants is the Adobe Products like PageMaker, Coral Draw, InDesign etc. should support the Unicode characters in Windows of any version. He says that he was successful with W7 in this regard. He wanted the same service of Unicode characters in W-XP too appear appropriately in the Adobe based functions. As far as my limited experience goes, PageMakers (5.0, 6.5, 7.0 etc.) (for books formatting purpose) in upto W-XP versions do not support the Unicode characters, but MSWord do support. Such formatting programmes function on depending on the installed fonts in the system.  
Ṛtaṃ, Pitṛ, Kṛtaṃ may not appear as we read here, in PageMaker like devices in and upto the versions till WXP. So as ऋतम्, पितृ, कृतम् also. There you may get either blank or the characters (meaningless to the context) like ࿘ ࿘ ࿘ ࿘ ࿘ ࿘ ࿘ ࿘ ࿘ ࿘ ࿘ ࿘ ࿘ ࿘. I do not know the reason behind this.  
I stopped using any programs of Microsoft Windows and shifted to use the new comfortable versions of Fedora and Ubuntu. I face no problem in using Roman with diacritics or Devanagari or Malayalam-all Unicode characters. But I do not know how to put the anudātta and svarita markings to the corresponding vowels, as you do successfully with Roman and Devanagari.  
Thank you very much Sir.  
Regards,  
Narayanan
