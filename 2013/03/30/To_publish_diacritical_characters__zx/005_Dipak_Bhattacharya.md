Dear Dr. Narayanan,  
The report must be true. Is the bad experience with Windows post-MSW 2010 or pre-MSW 2010? With your versatile linux you may not find the nice difference between the various combinations of the different versions the MSW with different versions of the Windows. In order to maintain it high profit business the Windows MS combination is continuously rendering its previous versions unviable making them incompatible with new ones. The young people will buy the new versions so that elders, just not to allow a communication gap with the new generation, have to go for continuous and expensive updating. It is in this wheel of continuous run and extraction that the problems lie.  
Another thing, PageMaker has itself become outdated because of the flexibility of the new versions of ADOBE. That too may have to do something with the problem. I do not know.  
I cannot speak anything on the problem without myself handling that  
Best
