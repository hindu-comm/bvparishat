Sri Acharya  
If I have followed the question correctly, it is to convert a  
devanagari script composition to a carry-any-where presentation such  
as power point through Adobe on a normal computer with XP. This is  
straightforward if you have a .pdf writer/converter. My usual approach  
after many trials and errors is to compose in Roman on Baraha  
(desktop). This has provision for conversion to other scripts. On the  
converted part rightclick for 'copy special'. The material can be  
pasted on to a word document. Save as .doc file. Since Baraha is  
installed this can be read in Devanagari. However this can not be  
transported. Next convert this to a .pdf file. Baraha font faces are  
very sharp and clear. Once a pdf is created this can be sent by email  
as attachment to others for direct reading, or copy (image file) paste  
on Power point. If this was not the problem pl excuse me. I just liked  
to share my experiment on which I have spent some time.
