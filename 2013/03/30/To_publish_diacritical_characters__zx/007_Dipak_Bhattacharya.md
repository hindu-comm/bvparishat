Dear Acharyaji,  
iLEAP might help in the following way. Type in Devnagari. You will find the inscript mode as default. Then click on the Tools tab above that will show a drop down list with 'Transliterate' option. Click on it, you will get the option 'Roman'. Select your Devanagari text and click on the ''Roman' option. You to have ā ī ū etc for आ, ई, ऊ etc.  
But iLEAP is unstable and often reports file-damage for apparently no fault of the user.  
If you have Windows 7 and the MSW 2007 or 2010 the solution will come from the Insert tab just to the right of the Home tab on the top bar usually called Tool Bar. First choose AU MS as font. Then click on the Insert tab. On the extreme right you will see the Symbol tab. Click at the arrow below and a drop down list or board will appear. Search through the Symbol board. You will find all the diacritics. Select your character and click on 'Insert' below. You get the character in your MSW file. You may also produce your short cut for which a box is available.  
Please inform if this helped  
Best
