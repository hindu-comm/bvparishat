Adobe Products starting from Master Suite 5.5 support unicode fonts. Although, you need to apply a script to enable unicode typing on 5.5 products.  

In version 6, you don't need to apply even this script. Adobe has done it for you.  

This was for adobe products.  
  

XP supports unicode fonts. But, you need to activate support for this. Please, check this link :  

1.  <http://www.azhagi.com/uniset.html> 2.  <http://www.muhammadanism.org/Unicode/WindowsXP.htm>

I know that these two things work perfectly independent of each other. But, I'm not sure about compatibility of Adobe Products towards XP. You may give it a try.
