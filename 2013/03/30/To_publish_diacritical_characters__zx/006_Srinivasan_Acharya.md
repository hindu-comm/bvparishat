Thank you all.

  

I tried all the possible ways to publish diacritical characters. As Dr Naryanan mentioned, Adobe fails to publish any Unicode characters in previous Operating Systems. MS Word installed in previous OSs also could not publish roman characters in the fonts other than Tahoma and Arial Unicode MS.

  

I do not know whether Leap Office was helpful in this regard. If so, how; also why Adobe is not helpful for Unicode?

  

Thanks,

Srinivasan Acharya
