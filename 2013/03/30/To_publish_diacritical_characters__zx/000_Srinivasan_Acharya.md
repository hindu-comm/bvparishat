Dear Scholars,

Namamsi,

  

Does Unicode diacritical characters are supported by all kinds of Operating systems and application softwares such as PageMaker, InDesign and MS Word.

  

We found Tahoma as sole compatible font for paginating through Adobe InDesign and Windows XP to publish these characters.

  

However, Windows 7 supports with all kind of fonts. May you please let us know the inadequacy; is any DLL missing or is it of other issue?

  

We sought for some technicians, which did not help, as they were unaware of Sanskrit-Roman transliteration exercises. It is better to seek veterans help.

  

May you please guide!

Thanks and Regards,
