Dear Colleagues,  

I am no expert like Dr. Narayanan but my own experience tells that it is MS Word 2010 installed in Windows 7 that accepts all Unicode compatible fonts. I cite one example that is Gandhari Unicode. MS Word 2007 had no place for the GU which I had downloaded. As soon as I changed to MSW 2010 some space was available for GU in the ‘Fonts’ file of Windows! I could not solve the mystery of this refusal by Windows 7/MSW 2007.

The advantage of GU is that it has the vocalic that is inter-consonantal/ante-consonantal initial/post-consonantal final r with a ring below the r. In AU MS only a dot below the r is allowed as in ṛta, kṛta or pitṛ.

It is very unfortunate that the Internet in general does not show GU’s vocalic r with a ring below. I am writing that with GU but am afraid that in some computers the internet will show a distortion. // //
