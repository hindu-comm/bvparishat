Dear Shri Shukla,  
Thanks for the post. But is that necessary when one can have inbuilt diacritics with the mechanism of manufacturing shortcuts provided by Windows itself. For example, I use alt+a for ā  
Windows also provides a mechanism for moving between English, Sanskrit, Hindi and many other languages like Kannad, Tamil, Russian etc. Just go to the Control Panel, choose 'Region and Language', choose 'Keyboard change', opt for Sanskrit or Hindi. You will be offered choice of placing language name in the Task bar and short cut keys for English, Sanskrit, Hindi, Bengali etc.  
In fact Windows 7 and Microsoft 2010 (also 2007) have made working with non-English languages much easier than formerly. I feel this with much pleasure and relief because when we began using the computer in the eighties we worked with DOS which called for inserting a card for the Devnagari script. Transcription was cumbersome and avoided. Diacritics were added manually by many users just to avoid hazards.  
Miles ahead now.    

Best
