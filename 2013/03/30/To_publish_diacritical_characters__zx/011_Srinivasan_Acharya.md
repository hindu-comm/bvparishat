Dear Sirs,

  

I am indeed glad and indebted to you for theinformation. Iwillgo through your suggestions.

  

Unicode fonts are executable commonly in all platforms and they are efficient. However, I would like to execute them through Adobe products in XP OS.

  

I need a solution, as my efforts went in vain.

  

Regards,

Srinivasan Acharya
