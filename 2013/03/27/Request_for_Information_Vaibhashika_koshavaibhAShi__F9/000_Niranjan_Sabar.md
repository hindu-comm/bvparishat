I am concentrating on critical Edition of Vaibhashika kosha(वैभाषिककोशः) written by Krishna kavi(कृष्ण्कविः) Who is a son of King Lakshana and Mallika. The date of the composition of the work was 17th Century.  
It seems to be very rich with lucid commentary by author himself. The lexicon gives the alternative forms of certain words.  
As per the N.C.C (G.O.M.L Chennai) information there are two manuscripts available in India.  
  
So I am hereby requesting all the respected scholars to share your valuable suggestions, information, some website Links, any reference Book or Website regarding this Work & Author.  
  
With regards
