Shri H N Bhat,

  

Thank you for the detailed explanation provided by you (This is old thread from March 2013).

  

So if I understand correctly, the specific Mahabharata (MBH) reference may refer to

  

first part (after diving it in 4 parts of the lunar month...we will leave reference to specific lunar month of Magha..aside, for now) which would mean say first 1 to 8 days of the lunar month,

  

or third part (after dividing it in 4 parts) which would days 16 through 23 of the lunar month

  

And in Amanta system - that would refer to first 7 seven days of Shukla Paksha (say.. Pratipada through saptami/ashtami) or first 7 days of Krishna Paksha (again.. Pratipada through Saptamai/ashtami).

  

Am I interpreting it correct?

-------------

MM and Bharat Ratna P V Kane has interpreted the above verse as referring to either Magha Shudda 8, or Magha Shudda 4 or Magha Krishna 4. (History of Dharmashastra - Vol 3 (Not 100% certain about volume number).. in the section 'Kalivarjya')

  

Appreciate your help,

  

Nilesh Oak
