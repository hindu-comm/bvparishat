Dear Vidyasankarji,  
  
While Nityanandaji will reply to you, kindly permit to add a few words here. When When Bhishma said that "tribhagashesha" (i.e., tribhaga-krita pakshasya-shesha-bhaga) was remaining for it to become Shuklapaksha, it surely means that he (Bhishma) was making this statement during the "tribhagamadhya", i.e., during the middle part of the three divisions of that Krishna paksha.  
  
Regards,
