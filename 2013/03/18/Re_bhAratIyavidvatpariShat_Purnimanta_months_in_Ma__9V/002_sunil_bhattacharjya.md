Dear Vidyasankarji,  
  
Agreed that the Mahabharata was composed by Vedavyasa in the very beginning of the Kaliyuga, i.e., immediately after the ascension of Lord Krishna, yet its status comes from its contents and not from the time of the composition. It has been called equal to Veda by none other than Vedavyasa himself just the way Ramayana has been given a status equal to Veda by Valmiki himself. Not giving Mahabharata, a status equal to Veda, means to me as saying that Vedavyasa was wrong in his judgement.  
  
Further, Nowhere it is said that all the text of the Vedas were composed at one time nor only upto such and such time and that any composition after such and such time t would not enjoy the Vedic status. There is vast difference in etymological meanings of the words "Veda" and Smriti". To me the Mahabharata and Ramayana fit more into the Veda than to the Smriti..This to me, tilts the balance in favour of the status of the Mahabharata, when weighed against the staus of the Smritis.  
  
Regards,
