Firstly, त्रिभाग means both one-third and three-fourths, as listed in several lexicons. This is also clear from the commentary by Mallinatha on Kumarasambhavam 5-57 (त्रिभागशेषासु निशासु च ..) which can be read under here. Therefore त्रिभागशेष can mean both one-third (of a month or fortnight) remains, as well as three-fourths (of a month or fortnight) remains.  

  

The above is correct. Since one-third is got by the explanation either explanations:

  

त्रिभ्यो भागेभ्यः शेषः either 1/4 - the one fourth, than three fourth which wants त्रयो भागाः त्रिभागाः, तेभ्यः शेषः the fourth one.

  

The numeral compound with nominal stems is regulated by "दिक्संख्ये
संज्ञायाम्" as in सप्त ऋषयः etc. which excepts other compounds with numerals as त्रयो ब्राह्मणाः - etc.

So if one wants three parts, it will not be a द्विगु compound like सप्तर्षयः, unless it is specifically designated with the value required unanimously in lexicons or mathematical texts. This is the reason for the different interpretations of त्रिभाग in which भाग is equal to अंश as a noun. A discussion of fractional numbers in Sanskrit was held in this thread:

Barely 6 parts or 4 parts or 3 parts do not convey any fractional value त्रयो भागाः even though compounded, unless taken as explained in the commentary of Mallinatha : तृतीयो भागः - the third part, automatically 1/3 unless otherwise specified. In the context it is clear night has three yama-s and in the 3rd yama, is meant. This is the way of explanation approved by Paninian grammar.
