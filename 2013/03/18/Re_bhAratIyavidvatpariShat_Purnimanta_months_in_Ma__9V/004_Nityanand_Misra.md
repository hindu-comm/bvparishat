Sorry for mixing up the Shukla and Krishna halves in the above paragraph, please ignore the same. I was also missing the context which I now have after some more reading. Here are two fresh insights.  

  
Firstly, त्रिभाग means both one-third and three-fourths, as listed in several lexicons. This is also clear from the commentary by Mallinatha on Kumarasambhavam 5-57 (त्रिभागशेषासु निशासु च ..) which can be read under [here](http://archive.org/stream/KumarasambhavamWithMallinathasSanskritCommentary/KumarasambhavaWithMallinathasTika#page/n148/mode/1up). Therefore त्रिभागशेष can mean both one-third (of a month or fortnight) remains, as well as three-fourths (of a month or fortnight) remains.  
  
Secondly, and more importantly, the commentary by Nilakantha on the verse 13-273-28 in अनुशासनपर्व (माघोऽयं समनुप्राप्तो) appears to be a spurious interpolation. It contradicts Nilakantha's own elaborate commentary on 6-17-2 (मघाविषयगः ...) in which he uses astronomical calculations based on several references from the epic and भारतसावित्री, interprets अष्टपञ्चाशतं (58) in 13-273-27 as अष्टपञ्चाशदूनं शतं (100 - 58 = 42) and concludes that verse माघोऽयं (13-273-28) was uttered by Bhisma on Magha Shukla Panchami. The commentary can be read under [here](https://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%B9%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%AD%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%A4%E0%A4%AE%E0%A5%8D-06-%E0%A4%AD%E0%A5%80%E0%A4%B7%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%AA%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B5-017) (bottom of the page).  
  
The commentaries on 6-17-2 and 13-273-28 are totally contradictory.  

1.  The commentary on the former says the date of Bhishma's death is
    Magha Shuka fifth, that on the latter says it is Magha Shukla
    eighth 2.  The commentary on the former interprets त्रिभाग as the third-part of
    the month, that on the latter latter interprets त्रिभाग as
    three-fourths of the month. 3.  The commentary on the former implies a Purnimanta calendar (third
    part of month remains on Shukla fifth), that on the latter implies
    an Amanta calendar (three-fourth of month remains on Shukla eighth)

It is clear that one of the two is not from the pen of Nilakantha. Rama Prasada in his article The Date of the Bhagavad Gita in volume 29 of The Theosophist discusses all this and more in quite detail and rejects the commentary on 13-273-28 as spurious. You may read it from [here](https://sites.google.com/site/nmisra/TheDateoftheBhagavadgita.pdf).  

With these new insights, we have another proposed date for Bhishma's death (Magha Shukla fifth), and the verse माघोऽयं ... verse as interpreted by Nilakantha in his commentary on मघाविषयगः ... implies a Purnimanta panchanga, so that from Pausha Krishna Ashtami (tenth day of the war when Bhishma fell as per Nilakantha) till Magha Shukla Panchami (day of death) we have forty two days.  
  
As per Amanta calculation, there are only twelve days from Pausha Krishna Ashtami to Magha Shukla Panchami (7 of Pausha Krishna + 5 of Magha Shukla). As per Purnimanta calculation there are 42 (7 of Pausha Krishna + 15 of Pausha Shukla + 15 of Magha Krishna + 5 of Magha Shukla).  
  
I would now leave it to Dr. Bhattacharjya and other experts of Jyotisha on the forum to comment on this as the computations by Nilakantha are beyond me.
