Dear Sunilji,



It is not my wish to enhance the scope of this discussion thread into other issues and debate what constitutes adhikAra and who has it or what constitutes the extent of the gItA. I am merely pointing out that describing the epic as the fifth veda and then appealing to the mImAmsA rule about the authority of Sruti overruling that of smRti is not needed to add strength to any of the views presented in the immediatecontext here. And I hold that, given the traditional stance on adhikAra and adhikArin with respect to learning the veda, clubbing the bhArata under Sruti would do a disservice to a vast number of people amongst us. (This view about disserviceis my personal opinion, of course.)



That said, the reference to itihAsa-purANa in the chAndogya and bRhadAraNyaka texts, as per many traditional commentators, is not to the mahAbhArata but to portions within the extant veda texts themselves. In any case, the mahAbhArata recounts incidents at the transition from dvApara to kali yugas, whereas the veda was already available even before, in the tretA yuga, in the time of SrIrAmaand in the kRtayuga before then. That in itself should tell us why the epic is smRti par excellence, but stillnot Sruti.



Best regards,

Vidyasankar
