Correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems to me that as per the abovegrammatical reasoning,the time period should actually be from the middle of शुक्ल पक्ष to the middle of कृष्ण पक्ष, as conventionally understood, not the other way round. Only so will the moon be bright with more than seven digits, whether waxing or waning, becausea full moon will occur at the half way point between the शुक्ल पक्ष अष्टमी and the कृष्ण पक्ष अष्टमी. If the पक्ष is currently कृष्ण, then instead of shining bright soon, the moon will be less than eight digits visible through the upcoming fortnight, whether waxing or waning, becauseit will actually be a new moon in a week's time.



Best regards,

Vidyasankar
