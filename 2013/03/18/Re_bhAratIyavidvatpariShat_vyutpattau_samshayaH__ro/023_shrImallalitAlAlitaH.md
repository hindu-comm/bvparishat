I don't think the following verse said this. The verse means that there are various means of shakti-graha, which again is called vyutpatti. vyAkaraNa, upamAna, koSha, AptavAkya, vyavahAra, vAkyasheSha, vivR^iti, proximity of a known word are means to shakti-graha.

I didn't get any such mail where he clarifies this thing. I've only one post from him in my inbox.  

Moreover, showing prakR^iti, pratyaya, etc. according to vyAkaraNa is not called shakti-graha, it is means to shakti-graha.  

So, if he just wanted to know shabdaniShpatti-prakriyA, then he must not use word 'vyutpatti' in title of this thread. Clearly, he any many other do not know meaning of word 'vyutpatti'.

As we don't see any second post from him, V's continuation with aupaniShada use of word can not be blamed. He is just showing shaktigraha from vaidika-prayoga. And his prayoga is supported by upakrama, etc.  

Moreover, as upaniShad-s use the word for any person who is knower of brahman, upaniShad-s are generating graha(knowledge) of shakti of brAhmaNa-pada. So, whether a person becomes vedAnta-shAstra-vyutpanna or not is another talk, he will definitely gain brAhmaNa-shabda-vyutpatti.

brahman is viShaya or not is something subtle. advaitin-s don't accept brahman viShya in the sense jaDa is accepted. But, they definitely accept it viShaya of vR^itti, otherwise what is the use of word brahma or mahAvAkya-s.

Yes, I just came to know by your post. But, I didn't get it myself.

That's not a problem. It is not always needed to seek help of vyAkaraNa to know shakti of every pada in every meaning.
