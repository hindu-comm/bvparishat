Highly misleading. Firstly not a single quotation of yours like ब्रह्मविदो ब्राह्मणस्य (just a qualification of ब्राह्मण) or ब्राह्मणो भवति (and not ब्राह्मण उच्यते) give a definition of ब्राह्मण. Your understanding of Upanishads and Shankar Bhashya itself is suspect (actually without Paninian grammar which you claim to be deficient, even the commentary you are citing cannot be understood). Which is why I say - leave the commentaries alone and stick to standard tools - Nirukta and Vyakarana. I can cite other commentaries which interpret ब्राह्मण as जाति only, in all Upanishadic references.

There are many verses like this - e.g. यो वै युवाऽप्यधीयानस्तं देवाः स्थविरं विदुः ॥ They do not change the meaning of स्थविर. No epic or lexicon or शिष्टप्रयोग uses स्थविर for a young man. Please read पस्पशाह्निक, especially सिद्धे शब्दार्थसम्बन्धे.

Uncorroborated claim. If it is popular, can you show examples in famous epics, lexicons, where ब्राह्मण is used in अजाति sense.

I can show commentaries that interpret ब्राह्मण strictly as जाति. So let's not go into commentaries and stick to Niruka/Vyakarana.

Random blogs, Google Web Search (as opposed to Google Book Search), Wikipedia are not to be relied upon.
