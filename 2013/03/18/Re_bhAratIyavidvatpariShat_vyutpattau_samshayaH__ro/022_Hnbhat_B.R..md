There are other means to decide meaning in addition to shaktigraha:

  

  

"*शक्तिग्रहं*व्याकरणोपमानकोषाक्तवाक्याद्व्यवहारतश्च।

वाक्यस्य शेषाद्विवृतेर्वदन्ति सान्निध्यतः सिद्धपदस्य वृद्धाः॥"

  

धातुप्रकृतिप्रत्ययादीनां शक्तिग्रहो व्याकरणादभवति क्वचित्तु सति बाधके त्यज्यतेऽपि।  

  

This is the decision.of Naiyayika-s. And in addition, in the case of doubt, there are some other means to decide the purport of the topic in the Vedic passages:

  

उपक्रमोपसंहारौ अभ्यासोऽपूर्वता फलम् ।

अर्थवादोपपत्ती च लिङ्गं तात्पर्यनिर्णये ॥  



<http://shiva.iiit.ac.in/SabdaSaarasvataSarvasvam/index.php/%E0%A4%B6%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%AC%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A6%E0%A4%AC%E0%A5%8B%E0%A4%A7%E0%A4%83>  

  

And more general :

  

संयोगो विप्रयोगश्च साहचर्यं विरोधिता।

अर्थः प्रकरणं लिङ्गं शब्दस्यान्यस्य सन्निधिः।।

सामर्थ्यमौचिती देशः कालो व्यक्तिः स्वरादयः।

शब्दार्थस्यानवच्छेदे विशेषस्मृतिहेतवः।।

  

the above factors are considered to decide the meaning in the case of doubt, in the case single word. But not isolated usage is taken up and generalized.

  

नैकपदानि निर्ब्रूयात्  

  

is the direction Yaska in his Nirukta against such attempt, in the case of Vedic usages. Given the above factors for deciding the meaning of words, now coming to the original question of व्युत्पाति which is obviously required by the member as his clarification shows:

  

ब्राह्मणः इत्यस्य पदस्य व्युत्पत्तिः कीद्रुशा ?

  

it is show he wanted the derivation of the word and as clarified later in reply to my query:

  

  

ब्रह्मम् जानाति इति ब्राह्मणः इति श्रूयते! कित्न्तु पूर्वोक्तरीत्या कथम् ब्राह्मणत्वम् वक्तुम् शक्यते? जानाति इति ज्नः(समीचीनेन type कर्तुम् न शक्यते) इत्येवम् खलु स्वीक्रियते?

  

तथा हि ब्रह्मज्नानेन एव कैवल्यम् उत्पद्यते! कैवल्ये जाते कथम् ब्राह्मणः इति व्यववह्रियते? ब्रह्मपदस्य वाच्यार्थम् त्यक्त्वा लाक्षणिकः अर्थः विद्यते किल?सः अर्थः कः? इति नैकाः सशयाः!!

  

The above is his intention. Instead,

  

ब्रह्म जानाति इति ब्राह्मणः - जा  

  

The confusion itself arose between the वैयाकरणव्युत्पत्ति and प्रक्रिया with the वेदान्तप्रक्रिया which are from different domains.

  

It should be naturally according to वैयाकरणप्रक्रिया and व्युत्पत्ति, ब्रह्मज्ञः and not ब्राह्मणः।

  

Very reasonable doubt. How it can be called the व्युत्पत्ति for the word ब्राह्मणः? The different व्युत्पत्ति you suggested and from the quotations from the commentators from the वेदान्त school, will increase वेदान्तशास्त्रव्युत्पत्ति of the member. But not clarify the doubt which was asked for.

  

वेदान्तव्युत्पत्ति given for the word is called the विवरण for the word, i.e. one of the शक्तिग्रह-s or विवृति as listed in the verse from Bhashapariccheda. And not व्याकरण at all and it need not be the व्युत्पत्ति or प्रक्रिया of वैयाकरण-s which is offered.

  

And according to वेदान्तप्रक्रिया itself, ब्रह्मन् THE TRUE nature of the Soul either जीवात्मा or परमात्मा and is beyond the प्रक्रिया of ज्ञान i.e. विषय for any knowing act. Itself ब्रह्म जानाति इति ब्राह्मणः is questioned by the member as you can see above. Only by secondary meaning one can use the word ब्राह्मण which is beyond the वैयाकरण व्युत्पत्ति of the word. and confusing with the वैयाकरणव्युत्पत्ति gave rise to the word ब्रह्मज्ञ which Subrahmanya's quotations only did not help to clear his doubt and only increase it by confirming it with quotations. This was cautioned by me in my earlier post itself. The member himself has not turned after it to the thread. And the explanation offered in Vedanta, has been suggested by वैयाकरणव्युत्पत्ति in my earlier post itself:

  

ब्रह्म वेदस्तमधीते वा सः।

इति भरतः॥

  

and the word ब्रह्मन् itself means as explained in my first post. And one more misleading interpretation of जाति is the cause of problem. जाति is defined to the words category of meaning, in so far as शब्दशास्त्र is concerned, while जाति seems to differentiate between the वर्ण-s as in पुरुषसूक्त and many other related literature. There is the definition of शूद्र in वेदान्तसूत्र which differenciatesशूद्र who doesn't have the chance to श्रवण of वेद-s as I have heard of it.

\\

  

  

१,३.३२ । शुगस्य तदनादरश्रवणात्तदाद्रवणात्सूच्यते हि । १,३.३३ । क्षत्रियत्वगतेश्च । १,३.३४ । उत्तरत्र चैत्ररथेन लिङ्गात् । १,३.३५ । संस्कारपरामर्शात्तदभावाभिलापाच्च । १,३.३६ । तदभावनिर्धारणे च प्रवृत्तेः । १,३.३७ । श्रवणाध्ययनार्थप्रतिषेधात् । १,३.३८ ।  

  

(Please correct spell errors if any found on the web page from which I copied above) which is disputed in the शास्त्र and above commentaries on them which have their own objective अथातो ब्रह्मजिज्ञासा where itself the differentiation from the twin शास्त्र begins whether श्रवण is needed for ब्रह्मज्ञान or not as proclaimed by आत्मा वा अरे द्रष्टव्यः श्रोतव्यो मन्तव्यश्चोपपत्तिभिः। and other similar श्रुति-s, whether वेदाध्ययन is prerequisite for वेदान्ताध्ययन or not. which yourself are familiar more than me. अथातो धर्मजिज्ञासा has the objective of knowing चोदनालक्षणो धर्मः। which is the domain of ब्राह्मण texts while उपनिषद् texts have their own agenda as VedantaSutra-s tried to organize.Anyhow, श्रवण-मनन-निदिध्यासन, विधि-s apply to the ब्रह्मन् - the तत्त्व, target if ब्रह्मसूत्र-s as the name itself suggests. But only श्रवण and मनन is possible in the the world of the words as the तत्त्व is beyond these. as proclaimed यतो वाचो निवर्तन्ते अप्राप्य मनसा सह, and तदेव व्रह्म त्वं विद्धि नेदं यदिदमुपासते which includes all the three.

  

and जाति of वैयाकरण-s defined as। आकृतिग्रहणा जातिर्लिङ्गानां च न सर्वभाक्। सकृदाख्यातनिर्गाह्या गोत्रं च चरणैः सह।

and the सूत्र ब्राह्मोऽजातौ has been technically interpreted so as to include all the possible shades of meanings. Here one can see the different implications of जाति:

  

<http://sanskritdocuments.org/learning_tools/sarvanisutrani/4.1.63.htm>  

  

according to Nyasa and Padamanjari.

  

Now, the question is when व्युत्पत्ति of वैयाकरण-s for the word is requested, in increasing the व्युत्पत्ति of वेदान्तशास्त्र in उपनिषद् is a different thing. And clearing his doubt in the व्युत्पत्ति is postponed by the requester himself I suppose. It is said

  

  

आम्रान् पृष्टः कोविदारानाचष्टे



Not anything like the contradiction between व्याकरणशास्त्रव्युत्पत्ति and वेदान्तशास्त्रव्युत्पत्ति which are independent domains.

  

But only two are different and no need to make confusion as the member got confused.

  

Lastly it is an accepted fact

  

काणादं पाणिनीयं च सर्वशास्त्रोपकारकम्॥

  

whether one accepts their authority or not.
