That's correct. But, once people supporting different systems clarify that same word means different things in different systems, there will arise no confusion. Instead it will help vyutpatti.  

The question asked for vyutpatti, which is essentially 'knowledge of pada-shakti'. vyutpatti doesn't essentially needs to include vyAkaraNa-prakriyA, what to say about following a specific vyAkaraNa which too has varying interpretation.  
This shakti-GYAna or vyutpatti occurs by various means, including vyAkaraNa, koSha, shiShTa-prayoga, etc. Usage in upaniShad-s are no different in this case. They also generate shakti-GYAna. So, we have to accept both meanings as valid in different context. There is no need to be biased towards anyone.
