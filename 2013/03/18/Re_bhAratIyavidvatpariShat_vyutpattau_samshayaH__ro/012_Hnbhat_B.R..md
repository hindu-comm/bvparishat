It is funny that the blog does not offer प्रक्रिया but as it claims it is प्रतिक्रिया of ब्राह्मण which is entirely different from the प्रक्रिया following पाणिनीय and scholars wrangling with it for the युत्पाति of the ब्राह्मण and not for the word ब्राह्मण and its प्रक्रिया. This has to be born in mind in quoting from great texts like शाङ्करभाष्य and उपनिषद्-s. Confusing between the two प्रक्रिया-s of Grammar and अदौत would not be a scholarly discussion and mixing them will not at all help such discussion.

  

This is my opinion on the turn the topic is now taking. Anyhow, the member who asked the question has not yet cleared his intention and is silent so far in the topic.
