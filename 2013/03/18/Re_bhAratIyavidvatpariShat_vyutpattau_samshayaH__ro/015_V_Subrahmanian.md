It is not advaita that was sought to be portrayed but the upanishadic use of the word brahmana in the sense of not a jAti (caste) but a brahmajnani. The dozens of usage in the Mahabharata I referred to are also not in the sense of a brahmana jAti or veda vyutpanna but in the sense of a brahmajnani. I showed them in order to bring out the fact that the paaninian use/meaning of a brahmana is only too restrictive and not all. The Upanishadic meaning / usages shown cannot be done away with and is quite popular. All schools have commented on these mantras and no charge of sectarianism is justified in such commentaries. The skandapurana seems to contain this verse under reference found in a google search: जन्मना जायते शूद्रः । (*स्कन्द पुराण०*, *नागर खण्ड अ० २३९ श्लो० ३१*)
