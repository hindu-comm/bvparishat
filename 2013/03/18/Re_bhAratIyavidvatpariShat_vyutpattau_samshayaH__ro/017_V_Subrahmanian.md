It only shows your unfamiliarity with the Vedantic usage of the word brAhmaNa.  

  
For the Bh.gitA 2.46 verse, the word 'brAhmaNasya' is commented upon by Madhwacharya thus:  
  
ब्रह्म अणतीति ब्राह्मणोऽपरोक्षज्ञानी। स हि ब्रह्म गच्छति। विजानत इति ज्ञानफलत्वं तस्य दर्शयति ।।2.46।।  
  
Madhusudana Saraswati: ...ब्रह्मतत्त्वं साक्षात्कृतवतो ब्राह्मणस्य ब्रह्मबुभूषोर्भवत्येव।  
  
Ramasukhdas (Hindi) जो परमात्मतत्त्वको जाननेवाला है और वेदों तथा शास्त्रोंके तत्त्वको भी जाननेवाला है, उस महापुरुषको यहाँ ब्राह्मणस्य विजानतः पदोंसे कहा गया है।

The pANinian work is only valid for shabadsAdhutva and not for vAchya-vAchaka bhAva sambandha; this is derived by the author according to the context. There is no greater shiShTA than the Shruti and Veda Vyasa. In the Mahabharata there are dozens of usages of the term brAhmaNa to mean the brahmajnAni/jIvanmukta. All these will not be wrong just because the pAninian meaning fails to explain this usage.

As I said lexicons are not the authority here; only a guide for shabda/arthasAdhutva. The Upanishad, Veda Vyasa and other commentators of the traditions are valid authorities who have used/commented upon the word brAhmaNa in those contexts where the jAti is both inapplicable and wrong. In fact one Upanishadic reference to the word from the Br.Up. that I cited is having for its context the episode of Janaka becoming a BrahmajnAni and the term brahmaNa used to denote one. It is illogical to expect Janaka, a kShatriya, to qualify for the term by becoming a jAtibrahmaNa. If the pANinian rule does not allow the usage of the word brAhmaNa in the sense of a brahma jnAni, it, being a vedAnga, ceases to be so. Or we will have to hold that the Upanishads are not in the Sanskrit language but something else.
