I am familiar with चमकप्रश्न . I wondering if someone could elaborate on the term derivation "ajina (बहु कृस्न अजिन इत्य् औपमन्यव)" mentioned in your earlier correspondence.  

  

  

Sorry for posting without correction of spell error. It was meant for :

  

bahu.kṛṣṇājina ityaupamanyavaḥ  

  

बहुकृष्णाजिन इत्यौपमन्यवः\|  

  

The Vedic rite popularly known by the verb यज् already explained, in which many skins of antelopes are used according to औपमन्यव.

  

The opinions of Aupamanyava is quoted several times, along with others like शाकपूणि, शाकटायन etc. in Nirukta: precisely 17 times in the occasion of etymology of different words and in general. In the beginning itself he gives the derivation by this writer for निघण्टु as

  

  

,1: te.nigantava.eva.santo.nigamanān.nighaṇṭava.ucyanta.ity.aupamanyavaḥ  

  

The above encoding with dots in between is done for facilitating output with sandhi formation by a software and hence not needed for for ordinary reading. One can ignore them.
