Dear Dr.Yadu,

  

The IITGn workshop went off well. The pleasing aspect was there were many youngsters eagerly questioning the speakers. There was representation from BVP also. Sri Pravesh Vyas and a few other Sanskrit scholars from BHU and Gurukul Kangri were present. Their participation was appreciated by the speakers who were all from modern science and maths background. Sri Danino is compiling the presentations to be put on the web for public reading. Meanwhile I am herewith attaching my presentation along with the abstract distributed in advance.

  

The new material I spoke was about the importance of the textual tradition of Paraashara-tantra mentioned in several places in the Brihat Samhita and quoted extensively by Utpala in his commentary and also later in the Adbhuta-saagara. I highlighted that the visibility statements by Parashara for star Agastya (suspected to be a planet by his student) were correct for his period of c 1400 BCE as observed from latitudes around Kurukshetra. I am still working on the importance of Agastya for tracing the history of pre-siddhantic astronomy.

  

The new information that I got was about Brahmagupta's 'Bhaavanaa' (628AD) and his originality in having solved the so called Pell's equation. There is a 1100 year gap between him and the European mathematicians!

Regards
