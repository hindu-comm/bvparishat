Dear Dr. Ramanujan,  
Kindly bear with me for I have a small request to make.  
Your mails' subject line always begins in a Unicode non-compliant font and, perhaps, the language is Sanskrit. It is followed by the English version but the first Sanskrit (so I guess) version is usually very long.  The English version would normally remain hidden but one may carry the cursor to the end to make the English version visible. So if one does not have the font of the initial line installed with one's computer, one would not know about the subject without taking the trouble of going to the end of the long subject line and may be before reading the letter. It may so happen that when in a hurry one would not open the mail.

It is desirable that such things did not happen. For that, could it be possible for you to write the subject line in a Unicode compliant font?  
This letter is sent in view of the importance of the relevant mails.  
Best  
DB
