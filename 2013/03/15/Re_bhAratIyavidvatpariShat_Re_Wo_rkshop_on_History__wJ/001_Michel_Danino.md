Dear Dr. Joshi,



Your point is well taken. As part of an attempt to reintegrate India’s traditional knowledge systems into the engineering stream, we do intend to cover technologies, from metallurgy to chemistry, architecture, textile, transport, agriculture etc., but we realized it was hopeless to try and club it all together. Hence this is only one in a series of workshops planned at IIT Gandhinagar, which we have earmarked for astronomy and mathematics as this is already a vast and rich field. (Last August, we organized one on archaeology.)



The topics to be discussed at the workshop will not deal with chronology or other contentious issues, but with the techniques and approaches developed in India. This can make an important contribution to our understanding of the evolution of ideas here.



We intend to make the video-recordings available on IIT GN’s website later on. I am sure the presentations will be most civil and enriching.



With regards,



Michel Danino
