Dear Michel Danino and Dr, RNI



Thanks for reply. I am looking for a text book on "History of Science in India" for one semester undergraduate course. Please make suggestions. Thanks. N.R.Joshi

Dear Dr. Joshi,



Your point is well taken. As part of an attempt to reintegrate India’s traditional knowledge systems into the engineering stream, we do intend to cover technologies, from metallurgy to chemistry, architecture, textile, transport, agriculture etc., but we realized it was hopeless to try and club it all together. Hence this is only one in a series of workshops planned at IIT Gandhinagar, which we have earmarked for astronomy and mathematics as this is already a vast and rich field. (Last August, we organized one on archaeology.)
