It looks like the nyAya has its origin in the Upanishad itself. The chandogya upanishad 6th chapter teaches: एकविज्ञानेन सर्वविज्ञानम्
\[through the lines: येनाश्रुतं श्रुतं भवति मतममतमविज्ञातं विज्ञातं \] and goes on to give three examples: clay - clay products, gold - gold products and iron - iron products. In the अनुभूतिप्रकाशः Swami Vidyaranya in the chapter on this Upanishad gives the example:  
  
आकृत्याधारभागो यो घटस्यासौ तु बुध्यते ।  
आधारो मृत्तिका, आधेय आकारश्चोभयं घटः ॥ ७ ॥  
आधारभागमात्रेऽपि ज्ञाते ज्ञातो घटो भवेत् ।  
*गोपुच्छमात्रसंस्पर्शात् गोस्पर्शव्रतपूर्तिवत्* ॥ ८ ॥  
  
If a person wants to gain puNyam by touching a cow, or if touching a cow is a part of a vrata, it is not necessary to touch the entire cow; it is enough if just a part, the tail, is touched, in order to accomplish the vow of touching a cow.  
  
In the munDaka upanishad too at the very start it is asked: कस्मिन्नु भगवो विज्ञाते इदं सर्वं विज्ञातं स्यात् ।  
  
In the example you have cited, it could be:  
  
A person called सुलोचना is called just 'सुलो' and with this much the person responds. शशिधरः / शशिकला is addressed as just 'शशि'.  
  
Or it could be the famous example in the VishnusahasranAma:  
  
श्रीराम राम रामेति रमे रामे मनोरमे ।  
*सहस्रनाम तत्तुल्यं रामनाम* वरानने ॥  
  
Just the uttering of one name 'Rama' (which is one, (नाम)एकदेश) of the thousand names of the Lord) is equivalent to (uttering/chanting) the entire thousand names (सहस्र)नाममात्र.  
  
This example could also be considered:  
  
बिल्वानां दर्शनं पुण्यं स्पर्शनं पापनाशनम् where the sparsha of the entire lot of bilva leaves or the whole bilva tree might be impossible.
Even if a part of the tree or just one of the leaves is touched it would suffice.
