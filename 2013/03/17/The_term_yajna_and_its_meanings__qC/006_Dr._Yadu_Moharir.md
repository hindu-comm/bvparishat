Namaskar Scholars

Here, all activities performed during living are classified under the term *yajïa*that includes designed efforts Therefore could we not make a generic meaning as - Carefully thought out & planned experiments that is known to all.  

  

Going back to Nirukta

3,19: yajñaḥ.kasmāt,.prakhyātam.yajatikarma.iti.nairuktā.

yācno.bhavati.iti.vā.yajr.unnas.bhavati.iti.vā.bahu.kṛsna.ajina.ity.aupamanyavo.yajūṃsy.enam.nayati.iti.vā/\[319\]

  

I think the reference statement of Aupamanyaa also provides a clue that during this occasion there were many sages. Could this not be looked upon as an assembly of scholars at a conference? However, if one tries to explain the term through derivation from "ajina (बहु कृस्न अजिन इत्य् औपमन्यवो)" then the statement does not make any sense to me.

Also, it provides a clue that our ancestors were constantly striving to improve through interaction with others in the assembly. (vaade vaade jaayate tatva bodaH)  

  

Thanks,  

Dr Yadu
