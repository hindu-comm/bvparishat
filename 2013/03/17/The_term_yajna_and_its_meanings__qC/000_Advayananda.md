ॐ  

Respected Scholars of the Forum,

  
Hari Om! Salutations.  
  
  

The term 'yajña' has been interpreted variously:  

1\. As the Lord Himself as in *Yajñārthāt karmaṇaḥ anyatra*, Bhagavad-gītā, 3.9  

2\. As a fire sacrifice and worship as in *sahayajñaḥ prajaḥ sṛṣṭvā*, Bhagavad-gītā, 3.10. 

  

3. As Ātman as in *brahmāgnāvapare yajñaṁ yajñenaivopajuhvati*, Bhagavad-gītā, 4.25.  
The commentator, Veṅkaṭanātha (author of Brahmānandagiri, a commentary on the Bhagavad-gītā) in the context of the word 'yajñam' 

in 4.25, says it is Ātman, the individual self.

  
He then says that among the various meaning

s given for Yajña by Yāska the individual self is one.  
  

Request scholars to please guide me on this:  

1\. The actual Nirukta statement of Yāska stating the various meanings of the term 'yajña'.  

2\. Are there any other meanings for the word 'yajña' apart from what Yāska has mentioned? 

  
  

Ever grateful for the assistance.

  
  
In Shri Guru Smriti,  
Advayananda
