It does not mean one of other names Atman is Yajna. It simply means Yaska lists the word यज्ञ among the synonyms of आत्मन्, and I have given the occurrences of the word यज्ञ in the Nirukta in my first post itself. As it can be seen in their contexts, it is not listed among the synonyms of आत्मन् which is not at all found in Nighantu in the first place. It is listed among the names of अध्वर and Nirukta is given for the word with different occurrences in Veda in the 7th Adhyaya.

  

Now the question is what is the source for the statement of Br. Venkatagiri? Is it simply the statement

 यज्ञ शब्देन च विष्णुरुच्यते --- विष्णुर्वै यज्ञ इति हि विज्ञायते।

in Nirukta?
