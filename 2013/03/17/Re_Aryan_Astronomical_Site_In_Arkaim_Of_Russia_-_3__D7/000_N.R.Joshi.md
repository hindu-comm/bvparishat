Dear Shri Lalit Mishra,





Dear Shri Lalit Mishra, Thanks for reply. Here are my views.







\(1\) It is agreed among scholars that Rigveda precedes Atharveda. There is no Magadha in Rigveda. The horizon of Rigveda is from Kubha (Kabul) river to Ganga river in the east. Moreover none of the four Vedas refer to the southern India. This indicates that Vedic culture in the subcontinent was moving from the west (Sindhu river) to the east and not from the east to the west. By the time of Shukla Yajurveda of Yajnavalkya, kings like Parikshit, Janamejaya from Mahabharata became known only as historical figures.

\(2\) Regarding the question of spread of Indo-European family of languages, there is a lot of controversy. You asked me to rephrase my question about the origin of Aryan civilization. Assume I did. Do you have any theory?

Swastika signs are found in Arkaim. They were similarly found in Hittite civilization of Troy. Swastiks are found in Indian subcontinent. One cannot use only Swastik signs outside of the subcontinent to prove that Aryan Vedic culture spread from the region of Sindhu river to all over the Europe. It could be the other way around. Please contradict me by giving evidence.

\(3\) I am not questing knowledge of Astronomy of the ancient Indians. Dr. RNI writes about it. I have no disagreements with him.

\(4\) What is meant by ‘Banga’ in Rigveda? Are you referring to Bengal region? Should not it be Vanga? Please give reference of the Richa from Rigveda where Banga appears. If Yajurveda knows Vanga, there is nothing new in it. By the time of Yajurveda, Vedic culture moved towards the east.

\(5\) Meaning of Arkaim by Alex Sparkey: Arkaim is a place where the sky touches the earth. To the south of Arkaim is the province of Uzbekistan. Here the heaven touched the earth. Here in the north was the Garden of the Heaven of the heavenly god and in the south there was the Garden of Eden (from Bible) of the earthly god.

\(6\) Dr. S.R.Rao found some ancient artifacts under water (west coast of Saurashtra). These artifacts do not prove exclusively that they belonged to the Dwaraka of Shree Krishna. To the best of my knowledge, S. R. Rao only suggests the possibility in his book. Please offer some concrete evidence such as inscription or signs etc. For your information another country from the world claims the ancient El Dorado-the golden city. Thanks. N. R. Joshi

\(7\) President Putin is visiting Arkaim. No wonder. Russians lost their empire by invading Afghanistan. They need something to bolter their ego. Russian language belongs to IE language family. So some Russian scholars are claiming the origin of Aryans from Arkaim. Each year they are holding carnival there to bolster their ego by projecting that the ancient slaves were highly civilized people.

\(8\) Many countries claim that Aryans originated from their soil. The only land that did not claim the origin of Aryans is the southern India. India’s real ancient history is in the people of the southern India, people like Kiratas, Bhilla, Nis’adas and hundreds of other tribes of the ancient India. Vrishnis and Andhakas (Krishna’s tribes) were treated as Vraastyaas by the so called pure Vedic Aryans (if they ever existed as pure). Too much concentration on pristine past of Vedas has ignored real ancient history of India. The ancient Rigveda samhitaa is not the whole subcontinent. Thanks. N. R. Joshi

Joshi Ji and Other Scholars,  



Answers to Query on Origin of Aryans in the light of Vedas  



Happy to receive queries with respect to Origin of Aryans, Pls find irrefutable facts that our scholars of universities and research institutes are not seen talking about, Pls find some criticle facts and arrive at conclusion yourself, I am not putting generic things that are found in our university syllabus and occasionally part of gossips in Vidvat Parishat kind of groups:



1. The term "Bharata" is mentioned in Rig, Yajur and Athrva Vedas.  
2. The term "Maagadha" is mentioned in Atharvaveda, I found it 3 times.  
3. The term "Banga" is mentioned in Rig and Yajur Vedas, I found it 4 times.

4. The Nakshtras, Rashichakra (As given Pashu in Taitiriya Brahman ), observation of Dhruva as mentioned inGriha Sutras and tradition of ascertaining the motion of Dhruva ( the precession of equinox ) regarded as Siddhi in Yoga are clear indications of continuity of Aryans Vedic culture in Bharat (India), Where from confusions come in it ?  



5. The mention of Pratima ( Idol ) in Rigveda and since then continuity of Murti Puja (Idol Worship) in Bharatvarsha, Since, this is crucial as tons of misleading propaganda happened in the past that Murti Puja is A-Vedic, I am hereby providing the Rigvedic Mantra (10.130) :

  
!! Katsi Pratima kim Nidanmaajyam Kim-Asit Paridhih Ka Aseet !!



Coming to original discussion, I find raising point of uncertainty on Origin of Aryans is irrelevant as it's like finding out the specific place where the first human being was born on planet earth, Let the archaeologists, Anthropoligists etc discover it, The first human being of planet Earth is mentioned in Rigveda as Manu at 3 mantras at least, A matured query could be "What's the place where Aryan civilization evolved and where from it spread over the world ", Above findings that I highlighted provide definite answer to it. Another point related to your query could be how old Vedic Civilization has been on archaeological/historian records, The definite answer is provided by discovery of Dwaraka under sea, the aging of Dwaraka is undisputed.



Prof RN Iyangar should do more study in the matter of Mahabharat War and Kali Yuga start before asserting a wrong timing of 1500 BC, I intend to publish a comprehensive article with evidences on this matter.  



If our scholars begin study of scriptures and do some ground level research work, they can do groundbreaking researches too, I am truly disappointed with superficial nature of research works getting reproduced in our institutes.  



Artifacts of Arkaim : The Aryan Astronomical Site Found in Russia



Arkaim is situated in the Southern Urals steppe (coordinates: 52°37′37″N 59°33′40″E ) , The site was discovered in 1987 by a team of Chelyabinsk engineers, later on excavation was carried out under Prof. Gennady Zdanovich, Chairman of History and Ethnography of Chelyabinsk State University, director of Arkaim reserve, he says - "We achieved what seemed to be absolutely unreal, How did people of such ancient civilization manage to accomplish incredible technological progress, which still seems to be unachievable nowadays?"



Russians described Arkaim with various names pertaining to Aryan culture such as mandala city, swastika city etc., the description refers to the floor plan of the site, which appear similar to the swastika symbol encircled in a wheel as understood by the image provided below, According to the research conducted by archeologist Konstantin Bystrushkin, Arkaim tracks 18 astronomical events. They include sunsets and sunrises on the days of equinox and solstice, as well as sunsets and sunrises during low and high Moon, a claim is made that precession of the astronomical measurement could be at 1 arc-minute, However, I have nothing to prove or endorse it, I expect our institutes to have communication with Prof. Gennady Zdanovich's team, After some time the discovery was made, a group emerged in Russia who started saying that people of Arkaim were a culture themselves not the Aryans however this has claim has not gained momentum.

Although the settlement was burned and abandoned, still, enough is preserved there, Russian team’s explorations showed that Arkaim enjoyed an advanced technology for its time. It was equipped with a drainage gutter and storm sewage system and had actually been protected from fire: the timbered flooring of the houses and the houses themselves were imbued with a fireproof substance – a strong compound the remnants of which can still be found in the ruins. Each house gave onto an inner ring road paved with wooden blocks; and in each house there was a hearth, a well, cellars, an oven and provision for a cooled food storage system.



Alex Sparkey, a Russian writer says that in the local language Ar-ka means sky, and Im means earth, He explains that this means Arkaim is a place where the Sky touches the Earth, Here the material and the spiritual are inseparable,



Prof Deepak Basu, Nagasaki University has written a lot on the matter, He is marked in CC, I have taken information from his articles as well as from other places in this mail trail.

Lalit Mishra
