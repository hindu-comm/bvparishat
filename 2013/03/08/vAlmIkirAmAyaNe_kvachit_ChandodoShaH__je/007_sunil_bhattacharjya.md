Dear friends,  
  
For any discussion on language one should not lose sight of the historical perspectives. Contrary to the claims of the scholars of the colonial times, there is evidence that original materials did survive till this day and one cannot say that all the ancient texts were written after Panini. Valmiki Ramayana is a very ancient text and next to come were the Mahabharata and the puranas. Vedas were also old. Much after that came Lord Buddha and thus the Buddhist-hybrid Sanskrit appeared. It was only after that the genius of Panini took the steps to formalise the rules such that the liberties like the Arshaprayoga were restricted. Therefore we have to be tolerant to the so-called mistakes in texts like Valmiki Ramayana, though were really not mistakes and they should be considered only as the styles prevailing in those times.  
  
Regards,
