Thanks for the valuable suggestion, though as you have mentioned it would be laborious effort indeed. Labeling all the subtypes of अनुष्टुप्s and उपजातिs (14 types of combinations of इन्द्रवज्रा and उपेन्द्रवज्रा) requires a lot of patience since these are the most common metres used in epic poems. Śrībhārgavarāghavīyam has 194 अनुष्टुप्s and around 480 उपजातिs.  
  
I remember when I first compiled the index of metres for Śrībhārgavarāghavīyam (available [here](http://jagadgururambhadracharya.org/works/sbr/appendix.php)) four years ago, 14 verses were labelled as औपच्छन्दसिकs (odd feet - six instants + ra ya, even feet - eight instants + ra ya as). Finding the subtype of each verse was not easy. While I found the name of the subtype पुष्पिताग्रा (odd feet na-na-ra-ya, even feet na-ja-la-ra-ya) easily, tracing the the name उपोद्गता/मालभारिणी/वसन्तमालिका (odd feet sa-la-la-ra-ya, even feet sa-bha-ra-ya) required quite some effort. The name of the औपच्छन्दसिक subtype for verse 7-55 (odd feet sa-la-la-ra-ya, even feet na-ja-la-ra-ya) was elusive even after all my efforts.  
  
पतिदैवतिकां स चानसूयां परशुधरोऽर्चितवांश्च पूज्यभावात्।  
कुपितामिव तां स शङ्कमानः प्रियसुतशिष्यविनाशतोऽनुनेष्यन्॥ ७-५५ ॥  
  
This verse has the odd feet as the उपोद्गता/मालभारिणी/वसन्तमालिका and even feet as the पुष्पिताग्रा, and so I had even thought of labeling it as औपच्छन्दसिक उपजाति. I had to finally ask Gurudeva who told me this subtype is called सुरभि.
