Usages of Valmiki and Vyasa are self explanatory and self justified within those. That is why the varieties of anushtubhs available right across their works. So, there is no ambiguity in them. Those who challenge such works is simply due to the ignorance, so please do not call them as mistakes in Valmiki Ramayana and such sages do not want the sympathy of the people in the modern era. Those self justified texts well enough to protect them, and later the scholars recognise as arshaprayoga which could be taken authentic in all sense.
