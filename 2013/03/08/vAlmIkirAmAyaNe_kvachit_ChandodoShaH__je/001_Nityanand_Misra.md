Too bad it is too late, else Valmiki would have changed it. The human race has definitely progressed as now we find faults with Valmiki, Vyasa, etc which are ancestors did not with all their knowledge :)  
  
Jokes apart, the subject is highly misleading. Has Valmiki said that he is conforming to the conventional "Shloka" metre where the fifth is laghu, sixth is guru, seventh is laghu in second and fourth foot and guru in first and third? No! Then how can there be a fault? There are examples in Bhagavad Gita, Srimadbhagavatam, Valmiki Ramayama where the rule is not followed. There are several types of the "Anushtup metre" (the name is also used for family of metres of eight syllables, as in Sabdakalpadrumah - refer <http://archive.org/stream/sabdakalpadrumah02devauoft#page/465/mode/1up>), and this is one of them.

This is wrong as per Paninian system. The visarga lopa is caused by लोपः शाकल्यस्य (8-3-19) which is in त्रिपादी. The Guna is caused by आद्गुणः (6-1-87) which is सपादसप्ताध्यायी. The त्रिपादी operations are असिद्ध for rules in सपादसप्ताध्यायी (as if they never happened) by the aphorism पूर्वत्रासिद्धम् (8-2-1). So after the Visargalopa, Guna cannot take place in Paninian system. The two forms are

No. Same logic. अकः सवर्णे दीर्घः (6-1-101) is in सपादसप्ताध्यायी while the Visargalopa is from लोपः शाकल्यस्य (8-3-19) which is in त्रिपादी. Savarnadiirgha cannot take place as Visargalopa is असिद्ध in सपादसप्ताध्यायी (and also in rules from 8-2-1 to 8-3-18).
