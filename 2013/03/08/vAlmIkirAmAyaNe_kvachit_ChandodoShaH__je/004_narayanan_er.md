Exactly, Sh. Nityanand, and thanks for the comments. Now the Chandomanjari verse is not only making ativyapti and avyapti it hurts the rhythm of certain types of Anushtubh-s. Four feet and eight syllables each is the general criterion for it and one cannot make a beauty of it by following the samavrtta principle in anushtubh. It is ardhasama, the melodious one. I had given an instance in a previous reply to Sh. Vasukeya where no homogeneity in all four feet with regards to the weights of syllables. So, no sage like Valmiki, Vyasa etc. can go wrong.

Regards,

Narayanan
