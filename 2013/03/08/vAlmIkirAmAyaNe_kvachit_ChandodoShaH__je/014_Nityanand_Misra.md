It is true that Panini's grammar came much after Valmiki and Vyas. Even then, many a time it is our inability to comprehend the depth and intricacies of Panini's grammar that leads us to conclude that a form used by Valmiki and Vyas is non-Paninian. Even forms of some Sutras appear non-Paninian. E.g. इको यणचि does not follow ङमो ह्रस्वादचि ङमुण्नित्यम्. But the doubt vanishes when explained by a competent authority like महाभाष्य which explains नित्यं as प्रायिकम्, as one says नित्यं प्रहसति (=literally "always laughs", but actually meaning "usually laughs"). भाष्याब्धिः क्वातिगम्भीरः says कैयट, and when the commentary itself is called as अतिगम्भीर, what to say of the Sutras themselves.  
  
In this context one may refer अध्यात्मरामायणेऽपाणिनीयप्रयोगानां विमर्शः, the 1981 विद्यावारिधि शोधप्रबन्ध by आचार्य गिरिधरलाल मिश्र (प्रज्ञाचक्षु), who in his current आश्रम adorns the seat of जगद्गुरु रामानन्दाचार्य as स्वामी रामभद्राचार्य. Out of around 700 so-called non-Paninian usages in the अध्यात्मरामायण (ब्रह्माण्डपुराण), the work discusses more than 350 instances of सन्धि, कारक, समास, कृदन्त, तद्धितान्त, तिङन्त usages which appear to be non-Paninian. All the usages are established to be Paninian using various rules and परिभाषाs, expounding on विवक्षा, using अध्याहार्य terms, and so on. By the time one finishes the work, one is convinced that the title of the work is अध्यात्मरामायणे पाणिनीयप्रयोगानां विमर्शः with no अकारप्रश्लेष.  
  
A paragraph from the thesis reads  
  

यद्यप्येका सूक्तिर्यत्

यान्युज्जहार माहेशाद्व्यासो व्याकरणार्णत्वात्।

तानि किं पदरत्नानि भान्ति पाणिनिगोष्पदे॥

अर्थाच्छाङ्करव्याकरणसमुद्रस्य सम्पूर्णोऽपि विषयः पाणिनीये व्याकरणे कथं समाहर्तुं शक्यः। किन्त्वेतत्कथनं केवलं बौद्धिकविचारतः पलायनवादमात्रम्। शिव एव पाणिनिहृदयस्थ इदं व्याकरणमस्मदर्थं व्याचकार। अतः सर्वमपि वाल्मीकिव्यासतुलसीदासप्रमुखशिष्टप्रयुक्तं पाणिनिव्याकरणसम्मतं कर्तुं शक्यमिति गुरुसेवालब्धबुद्धिबलो गिरिधरो घोषयति।
