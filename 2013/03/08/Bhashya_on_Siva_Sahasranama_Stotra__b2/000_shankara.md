Pranams to all,

  

I would like to know if there are any commentaries on "Sri Siva Sahasranama Stotra" (of Mahabharata) other than that of Nilakantha Chaturdhara.  

  

During Google search I found that there is a bhashya on SSN by Lingadhvari, but no more details could be found. I am not even sure if this SSN is the one from MB Anusasanaparva or not. Any info on this will be highly appreciated.



regards  
shankara
