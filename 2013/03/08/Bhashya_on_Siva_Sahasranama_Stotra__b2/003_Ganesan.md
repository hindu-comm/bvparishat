There is a very useful and informative compilation along with a brief study called "SIVASAHASRANAMAASHTAKAM' by Sri Ram Karan Sharma former preseident of International Association for Sanskrit Studies IASS . It contains all the eight Sivasahasranama stotra-s from various sources. But unfortunately the book seems out of stock now.
