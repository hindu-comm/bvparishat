Namaste  
  
In the following site  
  
<http://valmikiramayan.net/utf8/yuddha/sarga123/yuddha_123_frame.htm>  
  
is this verse:  
  
*अत्र पूर्वं महादेवः प्रसादमकरोत्प्रभुः* \|  
\[At this place, the lord Shiva (the supreme deity) formerly bestowed his grace on me."\]  
एतत्तु दृश्यते तीर्थं सागरस्य महात्मनः \|\| ६-१२३-२०  
  
I would like to know which incident in the Valmiki Ramayana is being recalled and recounted here by Sri Rama to SeethA while returning from Lanka back to Ayodhya. Rama is pointing to various places and narrating the incidents connected to them to Sita.  
  
The incident, if it is related to in the Valmiki Ramayanam itself, may pl. be cited with references.  
  
Thanks and warm regards
