I thank all the scholars, including Dr.E.R.Narayanan, who helped me gain an understanding of this subhAShitam verse. When I read it alone I could not get the complete sense of it and hence I made a request for help.  
  
Here is Shri Misra ji's explanation.  
  
Warm regards

From the context, I guess the reading is प्रेषितापत्यवक्त्राद् and not प्रेषितापत्यवक्रात् (वक्त्र = mouth, वक्र = crooked) so please check your source.  
  
It is vaktrAt alone and I checked the particular book I have. For the post I had copied from an online source. Also in this book the word सर्वशोभा is given in a split manner: सर्व शोभा. I thought it could be सर्वं शोभा. Will there be any change if this supposed reading is taken?  
  
  
The faultless knowledge (विद्यानवद्या), the greatness of host of virtues (गुणगणमहिमा), handsomeness, wealth and bravery (रूपसंपत्तिशौर्यं), all loveliness at the right place (स्वस्थाने सर्वशोभा), eloquent speech in describing the virtues of others (परगुणकथने वाक्पटुः) - all of these exist only till (तावत्, तावदेव, यावत्) there is the appearance of voices (वाचां प्रसारः) from the mouth of children sent by the young lady of one's home who is occupied or burdened with cooking (पाकाकुलाभिः स्वगृहयुवतिभिः प्रेषितापत्यवक्त्राद्) sounding like (इत्यादीनां) "O father, there is no oil and there is no salt as well" (हे बाबा नास्ति तैलं न च् लवणम्).  
  
Maybe it is ironical, or maybe a humourous take on the गृहस्थाश्रम. It occurs in the section गृहस्थाश्रमदूषणम् of सुभाषितरत्नभाण्डागारम्, so more likely a humorous take.
