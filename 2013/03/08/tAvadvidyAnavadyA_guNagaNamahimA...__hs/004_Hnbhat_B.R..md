But I have a doubt about the composition in Sanskrit \_

  

हे बाबा! as संबुद्धि of any Sanskrit word.

  

Of course, some धातु can be made to get the desired form and in the संबुद्घि like विश्वपा and "वर्धते धातुगणः" will help to build up some convenient verb, if not available among the verbs already listed by many.

Taking it as simply a modern composition, बाबा a loan word, it can be explained beautifully.  

As Sanskrit word, the strain to derive it, makes the fun slip through the analysis.

  

  

The irony contained in the verse is very entertaining.

  

Scholars opinion is solicited.
