जय श्रीराम! I have chanted this verse since childhood but the Anvaya always eluded me, since along with तुल्य the तृतीया or षष्ठी is expected from the प्रातिपदिक सहस्रनाम, but सहस्रनाम is in प्रथमा. That was until I read this attached article by my Guru (in Hindi). The article explains the context (supported by a verse from RCM), gives a beautiful interpretation of वरानने, and then explains the लुप्ततृतीया from सहस्रनाम as a छान्दस usage in Loka in accordance with सुपां सुलुक्पूर्वसवर्णाऽऽच्छेयाडाड्यायाजालः (7-1-139). At the end is the lucid Anvaya of the verse with the words हे, जप and अहम् added for अध्याहार.  
  
With my बालमनीषा I can also add that वरानने can be interpreted as both a सम्बुद्धि for पार्वती and a विशेषण for रामे, as the lotus-face of श्रीराम is renowned - as गोस्वामिपाद says in विनयपत्रिका - "नव कंज लोचन **कंज मुख** कर कंज पद कंजारुणम्".  
  
Note that the verse has two traditional readings - श्रीराम राम रामेति and राम रामेति रामेति. The latter looks more likely as the chanting of रामनाम is usually done as 'राम राम राम ...' and not 'श्रीराम राम राम ...'.  
  
Thanks, Nityanand
