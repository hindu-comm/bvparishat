Namaste Prof Korada  
  
Thanks for for your response. All your posts are always educational for me.  
  
All all I am saying is that remaining alert about the potential dangers shpould be every one's objective to avert dangers that have not yet manifested.हेयं दुःखमनागतम् ..२.१६. and practicing "विघ्नस्तस्य न जायते"

  

Here "raw or ripe , properties do not change" that I mentioned was only pertaining to the properties of Oxalic Acid Contents (in raw or the ripe fruit) and nothing more.  

  

If the contents are less then thare would be less damage to "TEETH" or leading to the formation of Kidney Stones. If Physicians refuse to acknowledge this then do you think they are really helping the patient?
Would that not be a dis-service to the patients who may have the family history for Kidney Stones?  

  

My observations and remarks are not intended for any disrespect to the tradition but specifically directed towards who refuse to change under the banner of Tradition.

  

I will be publishing my commentary on "aShTanga hR^idaya" from a pharmacological perspective. This will be the first book in this category because pharmacokinetics that was cleverly incorporated by VagbhaTTaa is totally missed by the current manufacturers of Ayurvedic Formulations. I have included several examples of such formulations where manufacturers have deviated from the recommended tradition for manufacturing the specific formulation which. Release of book depends on the approval of may US Patent Application that incorporates the correct and profound formulation technique implemented by the the greatest formulator ( at least in my opinion). It is unfortunate that many big Aydurvedic companies have totally missed the boat.  

  

I therefore do agree with shaastra but have disagreement with it's practice today. from the originally recommended procedures in the text. I therefore follow "puraana mityeva na saadhu sarnam ......" and rely on my daily sandhyaa vandanam "sulabhaa puruShaa rajanm satata priya vaadina ......".  

  

I personally know number of Ayurvedic practitioners who only recommend specific brands just out of personal vested interests in the medications.  

  

It is the Sanskrit Scholars and scientists for other disciplines who need to get together and correct the errors in manufacturing.
Physicians have to take the responsibility for considering side effects and informing theses to their patients.

  

If all the Ayurvedic practitioner's think that there are no issue with respect to quality and or other wise then let it it be so, however, to make changes for the overall good for all patients they have to decide for them-self and live with their conscious. I firmly believe that "one cannot change if one can not or will not acknowledge the problem".  

  

So my issue is not specific but generic and systemic practice that does focus around quality heavy metal contents in many formulations that I have personally tested in US.  

  

My apologies for the long post and hope that list members do not take my post personally but in the spirit that knowledge is always evolving either we take it it and adopt to it or remain locked in the ivory towers of past glory.  

  

A vision without execution is nothing more than a hallucination.  

  

With best rgds

  

Dr Yadu
