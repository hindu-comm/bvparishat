There is a belief that when the elephant eats the बेल fruit (called 'viLAm pazham in Tamil, used to make many delicacies, like sherbet, even payasam), the hard shell of the fruit comes out unbroken but without the contents, along with the elephant's excreta. The fruit part of it is mysteriously consumed by the elephant. I think this is the meaning of the nyAya. Its applications in daily human life can be imagined variously.  
  
Scholars may kindly give their opinions.
