Namaste Ganesh,

  

IMO - The real significance of Kapithya fruit is that it reduces "pitta". The Tannin contents also increase Bile acid secretion. Thus the fat can get metabolized there by reducing the excessive stress on the liver function. Studies have confirmed the lowering of Liver enzymes.

  

All patients who under go transplant often develop Jaundice and have elevated liver enzymes. Majority of them also develop Diabetes. GaNesha is also associated with "Jambuphala" (jaamuna). Seeds (not the sweet Fruit) also a well known treatment for managing Diabetes.

All this start making sense when one looks at GaNesha as a case of "Head Transplant". I hope to publish some of theses in my next book "Significance of Herbs used/recommended by our ancestors" in the near future.

  

Best rgds
