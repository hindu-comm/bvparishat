नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

Dear Dr Yadu

  

'raw or ripe , properties do not change' - import of your posting .

  

A raw banana (flower too) arrests dehydration / dysentery whereas a ripe banana is a laxative .  

  

In my first posting here I have quoted Carakasutram - आमकपित्थम् अकण्ठ्यानाम् ( raw wood-apple spoils the larynx ) and कपित्थं सर्वदा पथ्यम् ।

  

Raw pepper causes कफ / phlegm whereas dry pepper kills कफ . Decoction

of black pepper and शुण्ठी ( dry ginger) is administered to a patient suffering from fever .

काल / Time , certainly brings change in properties .

  

In the case of अन्नम् ( अद्=भक्षणे , ’नपुंसके भावे क्तः’ ’रदाभ्यां निष्ठातो नः पूर्वस्य च दः’) it causes quite opposite results - says तैत्तिरीयोपनिषद् --

  

अद्यते’त्ति च भूतानि । तस्मादन्नं तदुच्यत इति ।

  

The one that is consumed and also consumes the consumer is called अन्नम्।

  

Up to certain age a person grows due to अन्नम् । The same person consumes the same अन्नम् but decays and dies .

  

Things have different properties during different stages and thousands of examples can be seen across Ayurveda .

  

The उपवेद was given by हिरण्यगर्भ and Yogis like चरक , सुश्रुत , वाग्भट etc. had expounded the same for सुखदुःखे हिताहिते (सुश्रुत) ।

  

They see things with दिव्यदृष्टि ( clairvoyance) and if one finds fault with them we have to check his credentials .

  

How can one find fault with such a शास्त्रम् ?

  

Already discussed earlier --

  

  

बाला प्राणप्रदा प्रोक्ता युवती प्राणधारिणी ।

प्रौढा करोति वृद्धत्वं वृद्धा मरणमादिशेत् ॥ (आयुर्वेदः)

  

If the girl (bride) is too young she would cause prolonged longevity , a girl who attained youth would help maintain the longevity , if she is प्रौढा / older in age (वरहीनम्) properties of old age dawn early on the husband and if the wife is too elder , the husband would die an early death .

  

धन्यो’स्मि
