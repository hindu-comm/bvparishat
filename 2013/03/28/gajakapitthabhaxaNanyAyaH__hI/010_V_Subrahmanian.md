The verse means: When Lakshmi, wealth/prosperity comes/arrives, we know not how, just like the sweet water inside the ripe coconut formed (without anybody putting it inside). (From the explanation given in Shri Shankara's cited page, the following is known:) Also, when Lakshmi, wealth/prosperity disappears, we know not how it goes. It is just like the fleshy content of the kapittha fruit disappears when the empty shell alone comes out of the elephant (after it has consumed it). The gist of the verse is: The arrival and departure of prosperity is inexplicable/unaccountable: न तर्कगोचरतामेति (as per the cited page).
