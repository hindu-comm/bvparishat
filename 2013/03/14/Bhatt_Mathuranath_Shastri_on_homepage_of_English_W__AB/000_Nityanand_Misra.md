Dear scholars  
  
For your information, Bhaṭṭa Mathurānātha Śāstrī was mentioned on the homepage Wikipedia yesterday (the sixth most popular website of the world). The "Did you know?" (DYK) section on the homepage of English Wikipedia was updated with the following fact from the article on Bhatt Mathuranath Shastri.  
  
*"that Bhatt Mathuranath Shastri pioneered several new genres in Sanskrit literature by writing radio plays, essays, travelogues, short stories, Ghazals, Thumris, Dadras and Dhrupads in Sanskrit?"  
*  
The article can be seen under  
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhatt_Mathuranath_Shastri>  
  
The DYK archivee can be seen under

Thanks, Nityanand
