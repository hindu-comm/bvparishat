ShriNityanand Misra JiNamaste,

I am just sharing myopinions with you.  

I don'tthing it is an appreciable think that to take some ones name while in the discussions  

regarding public and also a respectable topics like Sanskrit.

And i think first we; Sanskritparsons;should speak and teach mainly in **Sanskrit** in all over

our working places and also while in the communication without anyhesitationand then

itautomaticallyinfluences on other langues.For us it is really time to "Aatmaavalokana" and

seems it is not a time to thinkon others.
