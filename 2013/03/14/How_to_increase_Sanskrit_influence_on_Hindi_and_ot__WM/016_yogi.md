This discussion gives me the opportunity to ask what I always wanted  
to.  
I would like to make my Hindi pure - knowing what comes from Urdu/  
Persian/Arabic, and at the same time, knowing the Sanskrit  
equivalents.  
  
Is/are there some resources either online or offline which would be of  
help?  
  
And at the language fluency level - are there specific things I can do  
to propel my Hindi in this direction ?  
I adore reading literature, so suggestions in this area are welcome.  
  
I tried searching on google - "making hindi pure" , but I did not find  
anything noteworthy as yet.  
  
If there are any forums, google groups or other resources dedicated to  
this area, please tell me.  
  
Thanks,  
Vishal
