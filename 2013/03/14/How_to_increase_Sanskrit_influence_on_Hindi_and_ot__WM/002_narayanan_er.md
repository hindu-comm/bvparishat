Dear Dr. Murthy,  
\*Increasing Sanskrit Influence in society is certainly a collective task ahead for many years.  
\*How many Sanskrit words are there in Tamil to harm Indian culture? as Brahmins from Chennai chant Vedic Hymns correctly and speak Tamil too.  
\*Vedic and Classical culture of Sanskrit could be maintained even by 2% of the population of the universe, chiefly by the Indians, and we never expected that to be done by the Ghansnabis, Mughals and then the East India Company.  
\*Traditional learning, revision, maintanance and propagation of Sanskrit will boost its strenghth to the next generation too. No English, Urdu films can tamper Sanskrit. Having Sanskrit has the tool, why Kalidasa et al use various types Prakrit-s in their plays? Did it harm Sanskrit? Bhasa wrote in his Karnabhara: भो कण्ण, सुय्ये विअ चन्दे विअ सागळे विअ हिमवन्ते विअ चिट्ठदु दे जसो। But why not: भोः कर्ण, सूर्य इव चन्द्र इव सागर इव हिमवतीव तिष्टतु ते यशः।  
\*It is right that all dialects of Indian states are manipulated with English terms since the East India Company regime, and currently many English terms are used, but it is not easy to substitute them with Sanskrit terminology.  
\*Minority Vote Bank politics also cannot harm Sanskrit and culture. It will be extremely difficult to make laws to ban uttering Vedic mantras and Sanskrit verses, or to ban speaking Sanskrit. But any goverment in India has to support Sanskrit and culture if they need to rule. Because we have the instances of the Ghansnabis, Mughals and then the East India Company failed to wipe out Sanskrit and culture in India.  
\*Now regarding Malayalam, Sanskrit nouns were adopted in literature as substitutes to Tamil, but verbs are maintained as in Tamil.  
\*The Hindi suffixes like का को से पर में are Urdu and then affixed either to a Sanskrit प्रातिपदिकम् or an Urdu stem. But culture is beyond this, according to generation choice, as whether you one go with the Mughals or the Brahmanic Traditions. So if one delivers: वज़ीर-ए-आज़्म के एलानों के मुताबिक instead of प्रधानमन्त्री के निर्णय के अनुसार and many people across the world listening, nothing can harm Sanskrit and culture. Because, I believe that even if one prefer to speak: प्रधानमन्त्री के निर्णय के अनुसार he does not propagate Sanskrit and culture until and unless he practices Sandhyavandana and read the original Sanskrit portions from Vedic and Classical. Original, original only.  
\*So why we worry unnecessarily? Still we can propagate Vedas, Classics and culture right among the Indians through out the world.  
\*Vedas, Classics and culture are not that fragile that it could be eradicated by the mlecha groups in any era. तेऽसुरा हेलय हेलय इति पराबभूवुः।  
\* But the reals threat will be if 2% of the selected Indian population neglect Sanskrit, Vedas and culture, it will be self harmed, but it is not going to happen, because when virtue prevails, the numbers are not counted.  
\*So, Sir, lets us learn, teach and propagate to the best of our capacity.  
Regards,
