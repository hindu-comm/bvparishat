Mahoday,  

I meant like this, Scholars are not producing works which will connect us to our society, if produced people are unable access. So public is relying on bestsellers to connect  
  

I didn't point on tripati's brahmin backgroud, but his readers & audience, who are diverse including christians, delhi never had readers, now many youth are reading books. If scholars whose works are always authentic write books or connect with society, Sanskritization will happen in a large scale.
