Hari Om!  
  
Everything that is created even by GOD, has its own unique significance, purpose, utility... and Dharma  
So, if GOD has to prove the importance of a product for its existence in the Cosmos, Universe, on the Earth and in the life of Man, then it much more important for Man to find out the importance of the Sanskrit language in these current and oncoming times.  
  
There are around 7,000 languages in the world today.  
In Bharat-India, there are over 22 official languages, and around 2,000 dialects in 28 States, seven union territories  
And the Sanskrit language is competing with these complex maze of languages and dialects  
- both within Bharat-India and the world.  
  
The reality of its significance in these dumbing-down materialistic times is revealed thus

*  
Source - <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_languages_by_number_of_native_speakers_in_India>  
Number of Hindi speakers in 2001 census - 422,048,642  
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit>  
Number of fluent Sanskrit speakers in 1991 - 49,736. In 2001 - 14,135*  
  

Therefore, the most important and vital question the lovers of Sanskrit should ask is this:  
1. What specific significance, purpose, utility and Dharma does Sanskrit have for these current and oncoming times?  
  
In marketing parlance, a product should have a reasonably good balance between the 'PUSH' (of the makers/marketers) & 'PULL'  
(the demand from / by the consumers, users).  
  
The socio-economic-political demands and the needs of the current times are vastly different from those earlier times when Sanskrit had divine, formidable utility in the society - within the country and outside. Also, there were small-medium-big groups (including the kings/politicians of those times) that were benefited by the Sanskrit language and so were happy to promote it too.  
  
There are competing languages - English, Mandarin and now increasingly Urdu / Islamic language - that over the past few centuries / decades have carved out their own place on the global arena serving the needs of the peoples of the times. The current times therefore, call upon the lovers of Sanskrit to seriously focus their individual and collective thoughts on the prime question -  
1. What specific significance, purpose, utility and Dharma does Sanskrit have for these current and oncoming times?  
  
Sincere and focused debate on this one question - both on and off the internet - could possibly bring out some practical and effective answer to this question which possibly could help us think further.
