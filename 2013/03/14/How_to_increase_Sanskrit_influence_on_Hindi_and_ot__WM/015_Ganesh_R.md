Dear Sri Raghavendra,  
  

While being aware of what your honest concern is and me being with it, still I strongly feel what our learned friend Sri. NItyanand Misra has expressed is perfectly correct. We should never be apologetic in such issues and Sri. Misra is absolutely right in bringing contrasting parallels from people like Mr. Kkatju. Misra ji has been very realistic and practical in this regard and what is possible in our hands has been clearly stated by him. Hence we should appreciate it and follow and this is your concern too. Therefore there is no difference in our goals.  
  
  
regards
