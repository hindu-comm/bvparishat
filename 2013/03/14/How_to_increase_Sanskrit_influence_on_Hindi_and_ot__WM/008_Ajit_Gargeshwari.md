It is difficult to hear pure Hindi anywhere. If people want to listen to Urdu they have Urdu channels but there are no Pure Hindi channels for us.

  
What do you mean by Pure Hindi please define. Hindi language has several dialects and regional variations.  
  

TV Hindi is not meant for only Sanskrit knowing Hindi people or Hindi knowing Sanskrit people why worry about Hindi?

  
Are we concerned in this Group with Sanskrit or Hindi?  
  
Why does one need to increase Sanskrit Influence on any other Language I fail to understand. Its influence is a well established facts on all Indian languages
