Namaste Scholars  
  
The Main Point I am making is understandable by reading 'Though because of large common vocabulary it may sound that only transliteration can help to overcome the language barrier between Urdu and Hindi, the tendency of Urdu to use words from Persian and Arabic origin, and the tendency of Hindi to use words of Sanskrit origin, call for the use of proper Machine Translation System' - **sanskrit**.[uohyd.ernet.in/faculty/amba/.../](http://uohyd.ernet.in/faculty/amba/.../)**urdu**-**hindi**-**urdu**.doc  
  
The BELIEF is Hindi and Urdu have common words but Hindi has Sanskrit words. Urdu has Persian and Arabic Words.  
  
But this BELIEF is becoming False Belief. Very High Percentage of Persian and Arabic Words are IMPORTED wholesale into Hindi and Sanskrit words are Not Used. If there is a choice between Urdu Origin word and Sanskrit word Sanskrit is losing the battle. In TV programmes and films, nobody is saying Prem but everybody is saying Muhabbat, Ishq and other Imported words. I have given many examples in the first email. Kindly see.  
  
It is disturbing to hear Persian and Arabic words mixed with Hindi. It is not Pure Hindi.
