Namaste  
  
Dev Mahadev is a Mythological story. The Hindi is Shuddha Hindi with lot of Sanskrit words. It is enjoyable.  
  
But if you watch other TV programmes the disturbing news is there will be lot of Urdu words mixed in Hindi. It is not good. The DD channel is also not using Pure Hindi.  
It is difficult to hear pure Hindi anywhere. If people want to listen to Urdu they have Urdu channels but there are no Pure Hindi channels for us.
