I agree with Shri. Nithyanand Misra. We can't expect much from Bollywood, TV and news channels considering their ownership and funding and profit motive.

  

So the suggestions made by him such as use of sanskrit words among our family and friends is the best way forward. Slowly we should progress to speaking sanskrit at home and/ or may be with select relatives and friends.

  

I am sure things will improve if we make efforts instead of moaning. After all in spite of all that is happening around us, there are still 2000 families whose mothertongueis Sanskrit and there is Maddhur where Sanskrit is spoken by all.

  

I hope some day my knowledge of sanskrit will also improve enough to say these things in sanskrit.
