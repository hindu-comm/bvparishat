Bollywood, TV and news channels are only interested in money and not in Dharma/Samskaras/Samskrti. Do we expect anything good from them? Their *khichdi* of Hindi-Urdu-Persian-Mumbaiyya-English fills their coffers, so why should they care about how Jaishankar Prasad, Suryakant Tripathi Nirala, or Atal Behari Vajpayee spoke Hindi? Then we have intellectuals like Katju harping on some non-existent concepts like Sanskrit-Urdu culture \[sic\].

  

We cannot expect anything from mercenaries in this regard. We can follow the Puranic advice न वदेद्यावनीं भाषां प्राणैः कण्ठगतैरपि in our daily lives and use more and more तत्सम, तद्भव and देशज words in Hindi (and other Indian languages) and request our family, friends, to do the same.
