Respected Scholars  
  
It is not possible to expect Sanskrit will replace Hindi and other languages. But we can try to increase Sanskrit influence on Indian Languages. The sad story is Sanskrit influence on other languages has decreased. Many people said 'Sanskrit is not a dead language. It is living because of the influence on Hindi and other languages. Many words borrowed from Sanskrit are regularly used in them'. But is this true today?  
  
Hindi is taught in schools is Pure Hindi. It is very pleasing to hear.
But Hindi in TV programmes, Bollywood films, and sports commentary is very heavily mixed with Urdu. Bollywood Hindi is highly corrupted with maximum Urdu words. Some examples. They are saying not मनुष्य but शख्स or मर्द, not स्त्री but औरत, Not चिन्ता but फिक्र, Not इस के अनुसार but इस के मुताबिक, Not लगभग or अधिकोन but तक्रीबन, Not प्रतियोगिता but मुकाबला, Not कला but हुनर, Not संबंध but ताल्लुक, Not शरीर but जिस्म, Not प्रेम but मुहब्बत or इश्क, Not भगवान but खुदा and many many more examples. In even cricket commentary they are saying not सुन्दर shot but खूबसूरत shot, Not दुरुत्तर गेंद but लाजवाब गेंद, Not निर्णय but फैसला, Not score अर्जित करना but score हासिल करना, Not विशेषतः but खास तौर पर, Not धन्यवाद but शुक्रिया and many more.  
  
If you watch some old Hindi social drama films you can hear less Urdu words mixed in Hindi. But nowadays films have high percentage. The Trend is Increasing influence of Urdu on Hindi and Decreasing influence of Sanskrit.  
  
Why this stepmotherly treatment for Sanskrit Bhasha in her own land? It is sad to hear Indian Languages being invaded by Mleccha Bhasha words. It is sad many large organizations are ready to go on strike for small matters but they are ignoring harm done to Sanskrit influence.  
  
One person I know working in TV station told they want to increase Urdu words because they want people in Muslim countries to watch TV programmes. One more reason may be Muslim population in India after independence has very much increased. In many areas in UP, Bihar, Bengal and others it may be more than 25%. In Mumbai it is 25%. The TV stations want more and more viewers.  
  
In South India also I heard Malayalam had very high percentage of Sanskrit words but modern language has much less percentage. In South there is danger of heavy influence of English in languages.  
  
Why fight for using Sanskrit words? Because behind word is the meaning of the word and behind the meaning of the word is the Culture. If we lose the words of Sanskrit in local languages we are losing Indian Culture.  
  
I am requesting scholars to kindly think how to increase Sanskrit Influence.
