Bollywood has a significant presence of Punjabis and Muslims so it is not unexpected that Punjabi/Urdu/Persian terms are used in songs, movie titles, etc. Punjabi and Urdu have borrowed many words from each other. The Guru Granth Sahib has words like Khuda, Allah and Rahim for God, both in the compositions of Kabir, Farid, etc and those of the ten Gurus. Plus as you have said mid-east market also plays a big role.  
  
As for cricket commentary, not many people care about what Ramiz Raja speaks. Seriously.  
  
What's more concerning is that the news media is now using increasing number of English terms. Here are this week's reports from four news sources where the headlines use గ్యాంగ్ రేప్‌‌, ಗ್ಯಾಂಗ್ ರೇಪ್, ગેંગ રેપ, or गैंगरेप instead of सामूहिक बलात्कार (also widely understood) or the euphemistic सामूहिक दुष्कर्म.

Its the 24/7 breaking news media and social media (Remeber "Why This Kolaveri Di") which has a much larger impact on the young population of the country. Social media and students in metropolitan cities largly prefer English or Hinglish/Gujlish/Tanglish et cetera.  
  
But as Dr. Narayanan has said, we need a few motivated people to preserve Sanskrit and her daughters.
