Namaste respected scholars

I amsearchingmanuscripts and details regarding **Yogataravali of Shankaracharya.**

And i heard that there are somecommentaries for the same.

And also i want to know that is Raajayogataaravali and Yogataravali are the same?

because the same is available withMarathitranslation by G.V.Tulpule with the introdoction of Dr. R.D.Ranade(with 29 verses-Gajanan Press, Meeraji-MH;14-Feb-1956)

So pl help me to find the details and its availabilities.
