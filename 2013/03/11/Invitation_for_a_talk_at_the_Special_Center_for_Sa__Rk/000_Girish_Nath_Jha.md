**ABSTRACT**

Globalization is a powerful movement which conjoins and disjoins world communities. A large scale migration across countries is one dimension of it.Recent research (Block and Cameron 2002, Blonmaert 2010, Bourdieu 1991, Copeland 2010, Fairclough 2006, Kachru 2005, Pandharipande 2006, among others) has demonstrated that languages, religions and cultures, undergo change in the new diasporic contexts. However, how those changes are accommodated and authenticated are the issues which have not received much attention of the scholars. In this presentation, I analyze the changes in the pattern of language use in the religious rituals in the Hindu diaspora community in the US. In particular, I will discuss the issue of inclusion of English, as a new code added to the Hindu community’s repertoire of languages of rituals in the US (while it is typically excluded from the Hindu rituals in India). Moreover, I will point out that unlike India, English-Sanskrit mixed code is also used in the Hindu rituals in the US. Additionally, the use of Sanskrit as opposed to regional Indian languages is also promoted in the Hindu rituals in the US. I will discuss the motivations for this change and in particular, focus on the following questions a) how is the change accommodated in the religious rituals and the Hindu culture of Diaspora? (the mechanism of accommodation and its impact), b) how is the change authenticated? (Authority and mechanism of authentication of the change), and c) can we provide a theoretical framework to predict maintenance and/or shift/loss of languages, religions and cultures in the new contexts?

  

In this context, I will discuss the two major issues –one within the framework of Socio-linguistics and the other related to theology: a) does this change influence the register of religious practice of Hinduism and in the process, changes the semantics of English and Sanskrit, and b) does this change impact the theology of Hinduism.
