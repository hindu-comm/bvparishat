Dear Scholar friends,  
  
I am interested in knowing the possibilities of getting the soft copies of MM. Ganganath Jha's works. Can any body share directly those works or at least guide me towards the relevant links. I am also interested in knowing ab out his life and achievements. I will be greatly helped if soe onen could throw light on these issues.  
  
with utmost regards
