Now the question has become difference. What are to be ज्ञापक and what are to be considered as आर्ष.

  

Though I could not reply straightly, which needs expertise in महाभाष्य and शेखर and other works of नागेशभट्ट, the general nature of ज्ञापक-s are to be used to justify such लिङ्ग-s to justify popular usages by great usages,which obviously violations of the rules, but for the model set by Panini serves as the ज्ञापक to justify similar usages. As in the case I have already explained. If there is no specific purpose to be served, just like वृद्धिरादैच् instead of ऐक् it is not considered as such ज्ञापक. And even in the case of ज्ञापक-s, if such usages could be justified by some different interpretation of the same rule, by Yoga-vibhaga or some other means, it is not resorted as ज्ञापक. And even in such cases, there is another rule which bars voluntary violation of the rules "ज्ञापकसिद्धं न सर्वत्र" so that any body cannot violate the rules and say this is to be justified by ज्ञापक, आचार्यप्रवृत्ति. But only established usages are justified by these examples and many of them are indicated by such statements in महाभाष्य itself:

  

आचार्यप्रवृत्तिर्ज्ञापयति etc.

  

But the guard against misuse of these ज्ञापक-s is always there. Only those usages in other texts which could not be justified in any way, are considered labelled as आर्ष usages or archaic usages. In Panini's sUtra, if there is no such obvious purpose to be served by taking the suggestion of violation, it is considered as आर्ष or छान्दस. In other cases, the निर्देश itself is the indicator of such archaic usages. This is the principle of ज्ञापक, which may contain many परिभाषा-s or विधि-नियम-अपवाद as the case may be, to be used to justify archaic usages. And it is not a licence to violate the rule of Panini anyway. This is the idea of ज्ञापकसिद्धं न सर्वत्र.

  

In other words, one should be able to say either अपाणिनीय at all considering all the possibilities of justifying it under the rules provided and then only come to the conclusion it isआर्ष usage. Otherwise, we have to accept the view of the commentators resorting to such means as ज्ञापक, वार्तिक etc. to justify them.

  

Prof. Korada and others will give precise reply. The above is only my idea of how ज्ञापक-s are decided.

  

With regards
