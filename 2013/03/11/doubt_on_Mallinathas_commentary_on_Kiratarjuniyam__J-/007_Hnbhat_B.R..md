This is another question. As we can see obviously, वृत्तौ भवं वार्तिकम can be one of the explanation for the title itself for the sentences what we find in महाभाष्य and also in काशिका. I am not saying it is the only possible explanation for the justification of its name. The explanatory sentences are called by this name as we can see from the enumeration of मुनित्रय "वाक्यकारं वररुचिम्". The sentence came to be called वार्तिक-s and popularly known as वार्तिकपाठ apart from सूत्रपाठ, as an accessory to सूत्रपाठ. along with गणपाठ and धातुपाठ. The identification with कात्यायन and वररुचि being the same is another problem for researchers. But taking these explanatory sentences found in the वृत्ति-s earlier than महाभाष्य will justify the name, which is the source for both महाभाष्य, and काशिका.

  

Though मुनित्रय school doesn't recognize the importance of काशिका in the matter of authority on complicated issues, the importance of काशिका itself lies in its reliance on the same sources common with महाभाष्य, and it is a completely available commentary on all the पाणिनि-s सूत्र-s and contains all the possible explanations for the सूत्र-s including the इष्टि-s of महाभाष्य, उपसंख्यान-s ETC. May be directly from व्याडि’s संग्रह without its modifications in महाभाष्य or some other वृत्ति which is not available to us, which explains the difference of opinions and readings of the सूत्र-s themselves as available from the महाभाष्य sources. Now the question is that whether कात्यायन or वररुचि had first commentators or authors of वृत्ति-s only by way of suggesting only emendations, which we get only as edited and filtered by पतञ्जलि on the one hand, and unfiltered and edited source through काशिका directly. So there is nothing to say वृत्ति-s should not have वार्तिक-s, as the name itself suggests the same being found in वृत्ति. It need not be काशिका which is the only complete वृत्ति available to us.

The above explains the difference in reading due to the difference is the streams of sources. And it has to be remembered that भट्टोजी himself had written his own वृत्ति called शब्दकौस्तुभ on the सूत्र-s, which unfortunately not available for the complete अष्टाध्यायी. In this case, the difference is only in the reading, but without any difference in the purpose to be served. Whether it is उभय or अनियम, the effect is the same, it can be पूर्वनिपात and परनिपात in the cases where they are found, which can be justified by this extension. Jinendrasarvasvati and Mallinatha attests on the stream of काशिका and its वार्तिक-s readings. In the absence of this वार्तिक, they resorted on the ज्ञापक. That is the case as I can see.

  

Before the composition of सिद्धान्तकौमुदी, the same position was held by पदमञ्जरी commentary as the following assessment suggests:

  

कौमुदी यदि कण्ठस्था वृथा भाष्ये परिश्रमः

कौमुदी यद्यकण्ठस्था वृथा भाष्ये परिश्रमः।।  

  

glorifying its importance. The same had been said about पदमञ्जरी ---

  

अनधीते महाभाष्ये व्यर्था सा पदमञ्जरी ।

अधीते तु महाभाष्ये व्यर्था सा पदमञ्जरी ॥२।

  

I do not think the above verse is to undermine the importance of पदमञ्जरी or prove its uselessness as obviously it appears. But it contains the सिद्धान्त-s found in ,महाभाष्य. Scholars can show real purpose of the above verse according to their inclination. 

  

And it is to be noted in this context, that Mallinatha had composed a commentary on न्यास by name न्यासोद्योत, may be before हरदत्त. Whether to identify both Mallinatha's is a different thing, which can be debated. In this context, their authorship can be ascribed to the same Mallinatha. पदमञ्जरी also accepts the same ज्ञापक following न्यास.

  

Sorry for writing in length.
