Respected Scholars,  

Yes, Dr. H.N.Bhat has hit the bull's eye here to my query! But, regarding Sutras as I heard some consider in some cases as आर्षप्रयोग too as वृद्धिरादैच् instead of वृद्धिरादैक् etc? So, regarding what should be a ज्ञापक and what is आर्षप्रयोग will it be very difficult to say? Can anyone tell me the Siddhanta of Nagesha Bhatta here who is supposed to have studied Mahabhashya for 16 times?  
  

Experts only have to decide on this intricacy.
