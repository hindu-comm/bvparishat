I remembered this five-month old thread when my Guru was talking about the lack of कुत्व in 1-1-1 “वृद्धिरादैच्” while teaching grammar last week, and thought readers may benefit from this insight, hence sharing the same.

  

He said that even though the usage is छान्दस (छन्दोवत् सूत्राणि भवन्ति), it is not अपाणिनीय. Rather it is a पाणिनीय छान्दस form. He explained that the Sutra 1-4-20 अयस्मयादीनि च्छन्दसि applies here (अयस्मयादीनि is accepted as an आकृतिगण) to make आदैच् a भ, which disqualifies it from being a पद (as per 1-4-1 आकडारादेका संज्ञा). As आदैच् is a भ and not a पद, the पदान्तविधि 8-2-30 चोः कुः does not apply and so the कुत्व does not take place, giving us वृद्धिरादैच् instead of वृद्धिरादैक्. This is a पाणिनीय explanation of Panini’s usage.
