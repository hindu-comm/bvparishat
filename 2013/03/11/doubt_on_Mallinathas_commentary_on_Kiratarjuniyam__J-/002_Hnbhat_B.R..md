Nice English translation. But I am not in a possession of its correctness.

  

But the quotation in Mallinatha, follows the Kashika in the matter of ज्ञापक. And in reply to Karunakarananada Maharaj, it is clear that this ज्ञापक is not found in महाभाष्य under the सूत्र and need not be authentic. But it has been accepted in Nyasa and Padamanjari.

  

Mahabhashya lines in the context just give extension of the rule in certain cases not covered by the rule and I am not able to conclude what is the Bhashya Siddhanta on these extensions.

  

It is an accepted fact that there are many difference of opinions in the matter of the सूत्र-s dealt with in काशिका and its commentaries and sub commentaries on the one hand and on the other hand, महाभाष्य, its commentaries and sub commentaries. This is a matter of independent study and studied by many in several scholars.

  

Now the precise reply to the query of Karunakarananda maharaj is that the ज्ञापक is not found in महाभाष्य. Whether to accept the opinion of काशिका, न्यास and पदमञ्जरी accepted by commentators like मल्लिनाथ and others or reject the opinion quoted by Mallinatha is left a matter of discretion. The ज्ञापक does not find place in the ज्ञापकसंग्रह of नागेशभट्ट also. This is the position.

  

If the intention of the question is to know the meaning of the quoted line, it is clear by itself. "लक्षणहेत्वोः" The द्वन्द्व compound itself doesn't follow, the पूर्वनिपात as prescribed in "

"द्वन्द्वे घि" (२।२।३२ ) is not followed, which should have "हेतु-लक्षणयोः" as the word हेतु is घि. Also, "अल्पाच्तरप्" also doesn't find place here. हेतु is अल्पाच्.and hence also it should have been हेतुलक्षणयोः। This indicates the अनित्यत्व of पूर्वनिपातनियम the violation of the rule in the सूत्र itself by Panini. By this ज्ञापक, the usages like धूमाग्नी etc. are justified.  

  

The followers of महाभाष्य etc. may have some other means to justify such usages. Like "धर्मादिष्वनियमः" or by including in धर्मादि or राजदन्तादि such द्वन्द्व usages. So that the ज्ञापक need not be resorted to. But only the deviation from the rules will have to be justified in the same way.

  

The experts in महाभाष्य will elucidate further the idea. Plainly it is not found in महाभाष्य.

  

With regards
