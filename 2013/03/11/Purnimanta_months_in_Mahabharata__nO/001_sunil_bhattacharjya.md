Dear Shei Hudliji,  
  
This verse actually shows that the months were Purnimanta and not Amanta.  
  
The second half of this verse has baffled many great Sanskrit scholars over many decades. Not that these scholars did not know Sanskrit, they could not interpret the verse properly because their mind was prejudiced. If you look at the verse plainly it says"tribhaagashesha (i.e., tribhaagasya shesha bhaaga) is remaining to become shukla paksha. If you consider the paksha as divided into three parts of five tithis each, you will realise what Bhishma was saying. What Bhishma was saying is that the last part (of the three parts of the paksha) has to go (pass) before the Shukla paksha is going to come. This shows that Bhishma died in Krishna paksha and not in Shukla paksha.  
  
I hope Dr. R.N.Iyengarji is reading this mail. If my memory serves me right, in one of his past mails I read him quoting a verse from the Mahabharata, where Bhishma was referring to the Pitri-yajna to be performed in Amavashya, in the middle of the Month. That is possible only in a Purnimanta month. RNI may kindly quote the verse if he remembers that.  
  
Regards,  
Sunil KB
