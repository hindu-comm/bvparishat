So now you think that भवितुम् अर्हति does not go with मासः (like I think too). नीलकण्ठ's commentary takes भवितुम् अर्हति with मासः, so either we both think that it is incomplete/missing something or we both disagree with his interpretation of taking भवितुम् अर्हति with मासः. Disagreeing or thinking beyond a commentatry is never a bad idea, we need to often fill in missing details. And it is for this reason that Bhagvan Panini gave us eternal tools, the Sutras of अष्टाध्यायी.  
  
Now coming back to your अन्वय. If you take शुक्लः simply as adjective of पक्षः and not associated with भवितुम् अर्हति then something is amiss again. भवितुम् अर्हति expects two words as in A B भवितुम् अर्हति, and A cannot be an adjective of B. Two examples from VR -  
  
न मानुषी राक्षसस्य भार्या भवितुमर्हति (मानुषी राक्षसस्य भार्या भवितुम् न अर्हति, here A = मानुषी, B = राक्षसस्य भार्या)  
कृतकामा तु कैकेयी तुष्टा भवितुमर्हति (कृतकामा कैकेयी तु तुष्टा भवितुम् अर्हति, here A = कृतकामा कैकेयी, B = तुष्टा)  
  
So what do you think is A and B in the sentence पक्षोऽयं शुक्लो भवितुमर्हति? If we take A = शुक्लः and B = पक्षः (शुक्ल/bright is capable of becoming पक्ष) it does not make sense as then A has to be interpreted not as an adjective of B but independently.  
  
I think the अन्वय of second वाक्य is अयं पक्षः शुक्लः भवितुम् अर्हति. As शुक्लः is now not a qualifier for पक्षः but stands independent, it means "bright" and not "bright half of the lunar month". This confirms with Dr. Bhattacharjya's interpretation and not that given by you.  
  
The other question to be answered is what is meant by भवितुम् अर्हति. The affix तुमुन् comes from four Sutras of Panini -  

1.  तुमुन्ण्वुलौ क्रियायां क्रियार्थायाम्‌ \[भविष्यति\] (3-3-10) - this
    has the sense of future as there is अनुवृत्ति of भविष्यति from
    भविष्यति गम्यादयः (3-3-3). Example - पठितुं गच्छामि - I am going,
    will read \[once the act of going is complete\]. तुमुन् from this
    Sutra is possible and if it is the case, the meaning would be that
    "the पक्ष is becoming capable, it will become bright \[once it
    becomes capable\]". Note that लट् is used for both present and
    present continuous in Sanskrit.  
2.  समानकर्तृकेषु तुमुन् \[इच्चर्थेषु\] (3-3-158) - This is not possible
    here since इच्छा is not the meaning 3.  कालसमयवेलासु तुमुन् (3-3-167) - This is again not possible as
    neither काल, समय or वेला are present. 4.  शकधृषज्ञाग्लाघटरभलभक्रमसहार्हास्त्यर्थेषु तुमुन् (3-4-65) - This is
    also possible as अर्ह् is explicitly mentioned by Panini. If this is
    the case, then the meaning would be "the पक्ष is capable of becoming
    bright".  

So the grammatical reasoning with Paninian Sutras does seem to support the interpretation of Dr. Bhattacharjya. The time from middle of कृष्ण पक्ष to middle of शुक्ल पक्ष is when the moon is bright with more than seven digits, whether it is waning or waxing. Whether Bhishma is saying "the पक्ष is becoming capable, it will now be bright" (as per 3-3-10) or if he is saying "the पक्ष is capable of becoming bright" (from 3-4-65), the conclusion is that the पक्ष is currently the कृष्णपक्ष and the moon is about to shine bright soon. If the पक्ष is त्रिभागशेष (त्रिभागशेषः taken in second वाक्य), then it will start shining bright in three days time, and if the month is त्रिभागशेष (त्रिभागशेषः taken in first वाक्य) then the moon is now capable of shining bright.  
  
If you disagree, please explain your reasons supported by Paninian grammar. Or you may go to ऐन्द्र, कातन्त्र grammar also, but an interpretation has to be backed by grammar for it to be taken seriously. Note that two different interpretations may be both backed by grammar.
