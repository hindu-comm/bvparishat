Dear Sri Bhattacharya,



This is an interesting interpretative dispute about pUrNimAnta and amAnta months in the mahAbhArata. However, please note that it is not at all necessary to appeal to the mImAmsA rule about the hierarchical authority of Sruti vs. Smrti. The epic doesn't get automatically converted into Sruti, merely by virtue of it being described as the fifth veda. Inspite of being composed by Vyasa and written down by Ganesha, the epic has not been understood as Sruti.



The number fiveas applied tothe Veda is never meant for enumeration of what constitutes the extent of Sruti. It is used in a gauNa sense only, and it is meant to praise the epic, whichis specifically called itihAsa and allied to the purANa-s (see the frequent use of the term itihAsa-purANa in the darSana literature).



There would be another unintended and unfortunate consequence if you assign the epic to Sruti status. It would take the mahAbhArata into the exclusive domain of traivarNika purusha-s, like the four Vedas themselves, thereby taking tne entirety of it, including the Gita, away from general access to all. On the other hand, it has been explicitly said, SrAvayec caturo varNAn, as explicitly quoted by more than onecommentator on the brahmasUtra-s. Replacing sarvAdhikAra for the epic with special adhikAra for a subset of theintended recipientsis clearly not the original intention ofthe tradition.



Best regards,

Vidyasankar



ps. I've read bookswritten in English and in Indian languages that seek fifth veda status for Ayurveda, Dhanurveda and Gandharvaveda (i.e. Natyasastra) also. How far this claim may be supported from the original texts of these fields of knowledge is questionable, but they serve to underline the gauNa nature of the adjective fifth when applied to the word Veda.
