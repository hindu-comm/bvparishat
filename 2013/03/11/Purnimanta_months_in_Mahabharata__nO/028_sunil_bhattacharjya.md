Dear Shri Hudli,  
  

At the outset, please permit me to dispel your doubt (in case you have any) by saying that I am not at all influenced by what P.C.Sengupta said. Now, may I request you to tell me which dharmashastra according to you, had accepted the माघ-शुक्ल-अष्टमी tithi as the tithi od Bhishma's death. To my knowledge none of the Smritis / dharmasutras have said anything about it. LIke I said before about Nilakantha, so also I will say that I do not consider what P.V.Kane says in his book as indisputable. Did he work ob the date of Bhishma's death and the date of the Mahabharata war ? There is no sign of that.  
  

Nowhere it is said that Bhishma died on Rohini nakshatra. You have not read the verse properly. Secondly, as regards the work of M. Krishnamachar when he did not work on the date of the Mahabharata war. Let me repeat what I said in this thread in the very beginning that the Mahabharata had baffled the best brins so far.  
  

Regards,
