Dear Sunil ji,  
There is a saying: विद्यावतां भागवते परीक्षा’ \[ ’For the really learned the test lies in (expounding/explaining) the BhAgavatam'\]. Its terse construction has lent to numerous, maybe a dozen, extant commentaries. I have heard a scholar say 'If someone asks the Bhagavatam tree for Advaita fruits, it will give, so with VishiShTAdvaita and Dvaita and any other system.' One can understand why so many commentaries are there.
