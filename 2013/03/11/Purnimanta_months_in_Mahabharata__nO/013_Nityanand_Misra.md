There is no need for an अध्याहार here. An अध्याहार is required if the sentence is missing something. If the sentence makes sense, using अध्याहार will change or distort the meaning.

Please decide on one अन्वय. If we keep on changing अन्वय, that only means we are not sure of the meaning.

You have missed the point Dr. Bhattacharjya made. शुक्लपक्ष has a रूढि meaning in the period of waxing moon, whereas शुक्ल as an adjective simply means bright.

Please let us know what meaning of tumun you are taking and from which Sutra.

This is not how we interpret verses. One can say it is highly odd for Bhishma to say anything about the astronomy on his deathbed or for Krishna to say 700 verses before war. Rather than deciding what is odd and redundant as per you, please stick to Anvaya and grammar.

If you claim that this is what he "would have said", please answer why is अस्ति not said in place of भवितुम् अर्हति? There is a difference between the two. If Bhisma was saying what you think he was saying, he would not have said भवितुम् अर्हति. If we start with a meaning and then interpret the verse, it is hardly interpretation.

Which means the पक्ष is not शुक्ल right now. Else why would it be said that it is capable of becoming Shukla.
