This is a absolutely arbitrary ruling. One should be able to prove it by giving the correct date of the Mahabharata war giving entire tithi and nakashatra calculations and accopmmodating the three consecutive eclipses, including the 13-day eclipse pair, by taking the help of the modern astronomical software.
