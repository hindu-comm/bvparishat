Dear Subbuji,  
  
If one says that the Bhagavatam is difficult for the lay-persons to understand then it automatically follows that one may of the opinion that the sage Vedavyasa had miserably failed in his attempt to write a text for the layman, even in his second attempt, This may appear as an aspersion on the scholarship of Vedavyasa.  
  
If we look at it in another way it could be that Sridhara swami's guru wanted to see if his student had understood the message of the Bhagavatam well and that is why he asked Sridhara swami to write the commentary on the Bhagavatam.

'If someone asks the Bhagavatam tree for Advaita fruits, it will give, so with VishiShTAdvaita and Dvaita and any other system.'  

Unquote  
  
Instead of the Bhagavatam one can even put Adi Sankaracharya in that place and say that Adi Sankaracharya acted as a Dvaita teacher for the grihashthees when he wrote the different stotras and advocated the Panchayatan worship to enable the grihashthees to build a deity-devortee relationship, and that he acted as a Vishishtadvaia teacher for the retired grihashthees when he wrote commentaries on the Prashthana-trayee to enable the retired grihasthis to delve into the spiritual depths to understand that the Jeeva is a part of the Brahman and that he acted as an advaita teacher to those who had taken Sanyasha and is in in the process of doing so, by teaching that for one realizing the Vedantic knowledge as expressed in the Mahavakyas, there is nothing other than Brahman.
