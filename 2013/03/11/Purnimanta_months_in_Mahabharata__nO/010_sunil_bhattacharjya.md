Dear Shri Hubli,  
  
One cannot accept a text conveniently as authoritative for one thing it said and then consider the same text as unauthoritative for another thing it said. That is what I was pointing out.  
  
As regards the Purnumanta montrh, please see the commenary on the verse 14.16 of Suryasiddhanta by Burgess.  
  
Further, it seems you have overlooked my earlier mails in this thread, where I clarified the reason why Nilakantha cannot be considered as an authority for the present discussion.
