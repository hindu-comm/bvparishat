Is that the complete commentary or is something missing? We do not see any अन्वय nor do we see the explanation of पक्षः शुक्लः so it is not certain what is the अन्वय taken by नीलकण्ठ. I do not have the source to check with me.  
  
Any interpretation, especially a claim like this means पूर्णिमान्त or अमावस्यान्त, must be backed by complete parsing and grammatical analysis of the verse. Without an अन्वय and without an explanation of each and every term, we are just building castles in the air.  
  
As we see two अयं terms, there seem to be two वाक्यs. The अन्वय then becomes very important. Is त्रिभागशेषः to be taken with the first sentence as the adjective of मासः or as the adjective of पक्षः in the second sentence? A possible अन्वय (there may be other possibilities too) is (हे) युधिष्ठिर. अयं सौम्यः माघः मासः समनुप्राप्तः (अस्ति). अयं त्रिभागशेषः पक्षः शुक्लः भवितुमर्हति. As per my limited knowledge there should be two nouns (not counting adjectives) in nominative singular in the second sentence - so that we have \[X\] \[Y\] भवितुम् अर्हति. If त्रिभागशेषः is to be taken with the मासः in previous sentence, then what are the two nouns in the second sentence? And if भवितुम् अर्हति is taken with मासः (as seems from the possibly incomplete quotation of the commentary) and the whole verse is taken as one वाक्य, then why two अयं terms are used? Another important point is how is भवितुम् अर्हति to be interpreted and as per what Paninian rules. Specifically what is the कर्ता for भवितुम् अर्हति and in what sense भवितुम् अर्हति is used, is it used in the sense of भवति or भविष्यति or some other sense.  
  
For a claim to be taken seriously, these questions must be addressed. Panini's grammar is the standard tool for addressing such issues of interpretation. So request both Dr. Hudli and Dr. Bhattacharjya to support their arguments using grammar.
