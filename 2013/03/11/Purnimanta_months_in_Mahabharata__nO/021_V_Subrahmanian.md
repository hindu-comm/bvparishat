We have to first know who the 'lay persons' are. If they are devoid of Sanskrit knowledge, there is no use in Veda Vyasa's composing the work for their sake. If they are endowed with Sanskrit then the Mahabharatha or other puranas would be good enough for them.  
  
So if Vyasa's words are to be justified then the 'lay persons' are those who have not much samskaras. They are those who can be appealed to by giving a good deal of accounts of the exploits of the Lord by way of stories, avatara-s etc. With these the targeted audience can be 'won over' and brought to the path of spirituality.  
  
Nevertheless even this account in the form of the bhAgavatham needs to be expounded as we find the various often contradicting interpretations that the commentators have given. The very first verse is so tricky that each commentator employs all his skills to unravel the meaning.  
  
With or without commentary, even those without the language abilities to read the work by themselves will get the benefit of hearing the exploits of the Lord narrated by other sadhus/scholars.  
  
Thus there is no belittling Vyasa's vow to offer the work to the 'lay persons'.
