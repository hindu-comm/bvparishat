Thanks to Dr. RN Iyengar, I was able to track down the verse to 13.139.19 on the sanskrit wikipedia site:  

सदा नावि जलं तज्ज्ञाः प्रयच्छन्ति समाहिताः।  
मासार्धे कृष्णपक्षस्य कुर्यान्निर्वपणानि वै।।

And the commentary on the above is: 13.139.19 मासार्धे अमावास्यायाम्। कृष्णपक्षस्येत्युक्तेर्नात्र शुक्लादिमासो विवक्षितः।।

It is clear that the verse 13.139.19 is *not* referring to a "shuklAdi mAsa", i.e. one where the shukla paksha comes first. Please note the use of the word "shuklAdimAsa" to stand for a mAsa where the shukla pakSha comes first.

So it follows that in the following verse (14.44.2), the word "shuklAdayaH" refers to a mAsa which begins with the shukla pakSha. We have to intepret this occurrence of "shuklAdayaH" as "months which have the shukla pakSha (waxing fortnight) as the first", indicating amAnta mAsa.  

अहः पूर्वं ततो रात्रिर्मासाः शुक्लादयः स्मृताः।  

श्रवणादीनि ऋक्षाणि ऋतवः शिशिरादयः।।

As I wrote earlier, I agree that verses supporting either the pUrNimAnta or amAnta mAsa are found in the mahAbhArata. We have to be careful which verse we are talking about. It is worth considering what the book I cited earlier (Gupta Polity by VRR Dikshitar, page 24, available on Google books) says. Essentially, the idea put forth by the book is that there was an earlier period when pUrNimAnta mAsa was followed, that this period was followed by an amAnta system in the mahAbhArata era, and that the pUrNimAnta system was again adopted at a later stage (57 BCE).  

To see why this is a plausible explanation, we need to examine the effect of precession on the shifting of seasons, more precisely the summer and winter solstices and the vernal and autumnal equinoxes. It is natural to expect that the ancient astronomers made adjustments to the calendar when the effect of precession was noticed in contrast with a still more ancient period when the effect was not noticed or was ignored. For example, we find Varahamihira's saying:

आश्लेषार्धादासीद्यदा निवृत्तिः किलोष्णकिरणस्य।  
युक्तमयनं तदासीत्सांप्रतमयनं पुनर्वसुतः॥ पञ्चसिद्धान्तिका

During his time, the summer solstice (the longest day in the northern hemisphere) happened in the punarvasu nakshatra, not in AshleShA which would have been "correct", as in the olden days. Based on this statement it follows that the winter solstice would have been in dhaniShThA (corresponding to the summer solstice in AshleShA).  

The book by BG Tilak on the Antiquity of the Vedas (also cited by Dr. RN Iyengar in one of his e-mails) opines, (pages 53-54) based on a number of sources including the taittiriya saMhitA, the Jaimini Mimamsa sutras, and sAyaNachArya's commentary, that at a remote point in the past, the winter solstice marked the beginning of the year and occurred on the day of the full moon of the month of mAgha or perhaps on the full moon of PhAlguna or the full moon of Chaitra in even remoter ages. Perhaps, at that point, a pUrNimAnta mAsa made sense because the new year began on the day of the full moon or the day after, and hence with a waning fortnight. That the new year possibly began at the winter solstice is also confirmed by the words in the mahAbhArata verse (14.44.2) above, "ऋतवः शिशिरादयः" the winter is the first season, and the statement by Amarasimha, "द्वौ द्वौ माघादिमासौ स्यादृतुस्तैरयनं त्रिभिः।", meaning each season consists of two months, beginning with the month of mAgha. However, with passage of time, the winter solstice moved backward towards the new moon of mAgha. This could explain a switch to the amAnta system. It is also believed that the winter solstice, during the mahAbhArata era, coincided with the day of Bhishma's death, the माघ-शुक्ल-अष्टमी. A further shift of the winter solstice toward the full moon of Pausha could have brought back the pUrNimAnta calendar.  

At that point, the awareness of precession of the winter solstice must have given rise to concepts of the tropical and sidereal zodiacs and hence the Sayana and Nirayana positions of celestial bodies. The switch to Nirayana meant that the "winter solstice" was not allowed to shift any further and was fixed at the 270th degree Nirayana longitude of the Sun. Since the "winter solstice" was a fixed point on the sidereal zodiac, reverting to the amAnta calendar was not required. Another reason could be, as VRR Dikshitar explains, that a revival of the earlier pUrNimAnta vedic calendar was accomplished in the year 57 BCE.
