Dear Shri Anand Hudli,  
  
You referred to Surya-siddhanta as follows:  
  
Quote  
There is nothing unusual about splitting a tithi into two parts. Technically, half a tithi is called करण, as per तिथ्यर्धभोगं सर्वेषां करणानां प्रकल्पयेत् । (vide sUrya siddhanta 2.69).

If you really think a reference to Suryasiddhanta can help, why then are you ignoring the fact the Suryasiddhanta itself talks only about the Purnimanta month and defines the month which ends with Purnima in a specific nakshatra. So we need not go any further and it is settled beyond doubt that the month referred to in the Mahabharata was Purnimanta.
