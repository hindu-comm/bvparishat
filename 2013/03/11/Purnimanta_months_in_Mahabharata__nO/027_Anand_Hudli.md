Dear Shri Bhattacharya,  
  

In the History of Dharmasastra, MM. Dr. PV Kane says on page 364, Vol V Part I:  
  

"With great respect to Prof. P. C. Sengupta, I must say that his interpretation of 'samanuprapta' as 'samanupravista' is quite wrong and unwarranted and it is not possible to accept his conclusion that Bhishma died on 8th of dark half of Magha and not 8th of bright half, vide his paper in JASB Vol. XX No. 1 (Letters) pp39-41 (1954)."  
  

As you can see, there have been attempts to revise the tithi of Bhishma's death, माघ-शुक्ल-अष्टमी, that has been accepted in dharma shastra works. A number of sources and many factors from each source may have to considered to arrive at the tithi of Bhishma's death. For example, it is also stated that at the time of Bhishma's death, the nakshatra was Rohini. In fact, in the book by M Krishnamachariar, titled "History of Classical Sanskrit Literature" (Google books), the author has presented an argument (page 61) to show that at the time of Bhishma's death, the moon's celestial longitude was about 49.5 degrees and the sun's longitude was (90 degrees behind that of the moon) about 319.5 degrees.  
  

A Krishna Ashtami tithi would have implied the Nakshatra was Jyestha (or possibly anurAdha), not Rohini. If Rohini was the Nakshatra at the time of Bhishma's death, it follows that the Paksha was indeed Shukla, and not Krishna.  
  

Regards,  
  

Anand
