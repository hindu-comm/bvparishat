Dear Shri Hudli,  
  
There is no doubt that Bhishma died in an ashtami tithi and I am also not disputing that. One can see Vedavyasa using a lot of astrology in the Mahabharata, so much so that he was saying that the Saturn was afflicting the Rohini nakshatra and that is possible either by the Rohini-Sakata-Bheda (which is nothing but the conjuction of Saturn and Rohini) or by Saturn's aspecting of Rohini from the opposite side of the Zodiac. In fact Saturn can aspect Rohini from two more positions. Astrologically Ashtami tithi is ruled by the Vasus and Bhishma was the chief of Vasus, born as a man, under a curse, so the texts say.  
  
Secondly, the very word "Saumya masa" means Lunar month and the line "माघोऽयं समनुप्राप्तो मासः सौम्यो युधिष्ठिर।" obviously refers to the Lunar month of Magha. The Lunar month Magha ends with the full Moon at the Magha nakshatra. The very word Purnima or Paurnamasi exactly means that the month is full. .  
  
Thirdly, to me, what Nilakantha (the late 17th century writer of "*Bhāratabhāvadīpa*," the commenatry of the Mahabharata) says is not necessarily the gospel truth. The puranas and the epics constitute the fifth Veda and there are instances in the fifth Veda on the splitting of the paksha into three parts but there is absolutely no mention of breaking a tithi into two halves as Nilamantha was advocating. The highly knowledgeable Bhishma was obviously aware of the splitting of the paksha into three parts, particularly because his own mother Ganga used to go to heaven every month from the beginning of the last third part of the Shukla paksha to the end of the first third part of the Krishna paksha. Obviously Nilakantha has not read the Narada Purana, which says this and so he was not aware of the splitting of the paksha into three parts. So to me Nilaknatha's breaking the Ashtami tithi into two parts is not at all admissible.  
  
Fourthly, as regards the word Shukla in the verse  
  
अग्निर्ज्योतिरहः शुक्लः षण्मासा उत्तरायणम्।  
तत्र प्रयाता गच्छन्ति ब्रह्म ब्रह्मविदो जनाः॥ ८.२४  
  
it simply means the period of the shining Moon and that is when more than half of the the Moon is bright. The period of shining moon is from the start of the Shukla-ashtami to the Krishna-ashtami. That is also the reason why Bhishma decided to die before the Krishna-ashtami tithi was over. Further, as stated above Bhishma, as a Vasu, was the presiding deity of the Ashtami tithi.  
  
Fifthly, as regards the verse  
  
अहः पूर्वं ततो रात्रिर्मासाः शुक्लादयः स्मृताः।  
श्रविष्ठादीनि ऋक्षाणि ऋतवः शिशिरादयः॥ ४४.१-२  
it is giving the view of Smriti. When a dispute arises between Veda (including the fifth Veda) and Smriti one has always to choose the Veda (including the fifth Veda). So on that count also I would not accept the Smriti version against what is given in the Mahbaharata itself.
