Dear friends,  
  
I have read in the past about Bhshma's referring to the performance of Pitri-shraddha in Amavashya at the middle of the month. That shows that the Mahabharata refers to Purnimanta month. I also understand that there is mention of Purnimanta month in the Virat parva. I shall be thankful if any kind member knows and lets me know the instances (with references) as to whre in the Mabhabharata there is mention of Purnimanta month ( and of Amanta as well, if any at all there is reference on that).  
  
Regards,
