Not at all. He has said this is the period when more than half of the moon is bright. The word पक्ष is not mentioned either in the verse or by Dr. Bhattacharjya.

In that case either the book is missing some text or the commentary is not complete on the verse. The former may be possible due to a typesetting error or damaged manuscript. The words शुक्लः पक्षः have been left out, and and there is ambiguity around what अन्वय was desired by नीलकण्ठ.

That looks a bit strange. You mean the second वाक्य begins with पक्षोऽयं and ends with शुक्लः, and then भवितुम् अर्हति which comes after शुक्लः (end of second वाक्य is to be taken with the first वाक्य? So the second वाक्य is embedded in the first वाक्य? The order usually (not always) is irrelevant within a sentence, but I have not seen cases where words from two sentences is mixed such that you have some words from sentence A followed by some of sentence B followed by some more of sentence A.
