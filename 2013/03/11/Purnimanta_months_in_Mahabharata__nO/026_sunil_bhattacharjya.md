Dear friends,  
  
Sorrry there was a slip. Kindly read the correction below:  
  
Earlier verse with slip is as follows;

  
  
"Now as you can see from the Bharata-Savitri verses it is absolutely clear that the Mahabharata war started on the Rohini nakshatra and it was Trayodashi of Shukla paksha."  
  

The corrected verse is given below:  

  
"Now as you can see from the Bharata-Savitri verses it is absolutely clear that the Mahabharata war started on the Bharani nakshatra and it was Trayodashi of Shukla paksha.  
  

Regards,
