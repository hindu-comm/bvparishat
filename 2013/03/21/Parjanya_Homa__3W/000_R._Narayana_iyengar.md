Dear Scholars,

  

A friend of mine is a practicing Purohit and knows very well the prayoga-paddhati of Parjanya Homa. But he is interested in knowing the Vedic origins with textual references. I have told him about the KArIrIs.t.i. Is there any publication that describes this Is.t.i?

I request members to post further details.

Thanks

  

RN Iyengar
