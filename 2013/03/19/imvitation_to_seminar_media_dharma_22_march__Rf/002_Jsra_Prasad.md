Dear Sir,  
  
Happy to listen about such a seminar on 'media dharma'.  
Justics Katju wanted the electronic media should be under the control of PCI. But there was a strong protest by the media. There is no controlling authority on media's liberty in publishing sensational news, especially on TV news. We expect their 'svadharma' may be reminded in light of Sanskrit literature.  
  
Regards,  
Prasad
