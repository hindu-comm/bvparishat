Namaste  
  
The panchAgni vidyA of the Chandogya upanishat where five steps/stages are delineated prior to the birth of a child could be of relevance here. The concluding stage is: the jIva comes to earth through rain and enters food grains and when this is consumed by the parent, the food converts into retas and the jiva-to-be-born resides in the retas and through the father attains the mother's womb and then comes out. This is representative of the entire creation of charAcharam jagat.

**// 7.** **Panchagni Vidya**

This Vidya occurs in the Chhandogyopanishad, V. 3 to 10, and Brihadaranyakopanishad, VI. 2, and also in Kausitaki briefly. In this Vidya of five fires five acts of the universe are conceived of as sacrifices with their fire, fuel, smoke, flame, coals and sparks. Thus are the respective sacrifices represented:

|     |           |        |            |                    |          |                       | |-----|-----------|--------|------------|--------------------|----------|-----------------------| |    | Fire      | Fuel   | Smoke      | Flame              | Coals    | Spark                 | | 1   | Heaven    | Sun    | Light-rays | Day                | Moon     | Stars                 | | 2   | Rain-wind | Mist   | Lightening | Thunder-hailstorms | Cloud    | Bolts                 | | 3   | Earth     | Year   | Space      | Night              | Quarters | Intermediate Quarters | | 4   | Man       | Speech | Prana      | Tongue             | Eyes     | Ear                   | | 5   | Woman     |       |           |                   |         |                      |



The soul on its journey from heaven to be born again in a body has to pass through these five fires in order to acquire its fresh body. Fire disintegrates as well as integrates the body, it destroys and creates the body during death and birth respectively. The soul acquires new and new bodies as it descends and ascends through these fires. Each time the soul takes a body in each of these five planes an Agnihotra is performed in order to get a body in each world. The organs of the body in their relation to the soul are here the officiating priests of the Agnihotra sacrifices. Each preceding sacrificial oblation has the succeeding one produced as the food. One who has got the knowledge of the fires ascends to Saguna Brahman through Devayana Path. //  

The Prashnopanishat first Prashna too contains similar information. A particular mantra: 6 could be seen for some correspondence. And mantra 14 is commented by Shankaracharya thus in conclusion:

यत्पृष्टं कुतो ह वै प्रजाः प्रजायन्त इति । तदेवं चन्द्रादित्यमिथुनादिक्रेणाहोरात्रान्तेनान्नासृग्रेतोद्वारेणेमाः प्रजाः प्रजायन्त इति निर्णीतम् ॥

\[The question that was raised, 'From what indeed are the beings born?', has thus been answered by saying that these creatures are born by passing in succession through the pairs starting with the sun and the moon and ending with day and night, and then by proceeding through food, blood and semen.\]

I think an overall survey of these and perhaps other sources will give us a correspondence with the VP commentaries involving sun and rain in the creation process. For, in the Upanishads where creation is spoken of we do not come across the process where the sun/sun rays or mere rain alone bringing forth beings. In Taittiriya too it culminates in 'annaat puruShaH.'
