Dear Sir,  
  
It is a very interesting post with lot of observations on the subject. I am not an expert in this area but your post provoked to respond on some points put forth, with my little awareness.  



3. Can any student / guide who navigated the student through this path for earning the final award with a \< critical editing> explain out, what they understood as the difference between the two criterions : ‘ editing ‘ and ‘ critical editing’ ? and how their output matched the criterion set by the doctoral program ?  
For the award of a PhD, you must have minimum 3 manuscripts from the source repositories. Then only it is called a critical edition.

Yes, this must be some of the criteria in deciding the parameters of critically editing mss.

All of us agree that Caraka Samhita is the oldest Indian medical text. Many publishers have brought out this edition so far. But ironically, this text has not been edited critically! If I got your comment rightly, I would ask, why always a western model of research methodology is preferred over *Sabda pramANa/Apta vacana*? Since, the gamut of Sanskrit literature is based on *Sabda*. Its better to confine the functioning of statistics to numbers/percentages/ratios etc., while working with some analytical data. After all, statistics is statistics only! I read a joke - *'A statistician can have his head in an oven and his feet in ice, and he will say that on average, he feels fine',* (with due respect to them :)

I for one, would say that, the researcher should also review the text next to editing. But all that depends on the available time frame and personal ability.

So what? Are there any discrepancies? Can you kindly share some examples? (I may be more obsessed with the sayings - 'योsनूचानः स नो महान्', and 'प्रजातन्तुं मा व्यवच्छेत्सीः' and so on)
