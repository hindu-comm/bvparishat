Dear All  
  
Some days back I had chanced upon a PDF of मञ्जुनाथग्रन्थावलिः online, published by Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan, which has the works of Bhattashri Mathuranath Shastry (father of Devarshi Kalanath Shastry). The Granthavali includes जयपुरवैभवम्, साहित्यवैभवम्, and other works and has a detailed biography of Bhattashri Mathuranath Shastry by Kalanatha Shastry. I do not remember where, and I can no longer trace it among the digital books on the RSS New Delhi website. While some of these works have been published earlier by Nirnay Sagar Press, I am looking for the five-volume Granthavali. While I was speaking to Devarshi Ji today, he mentioned that RSS has published all five volumes online. I would be much obliged if somebody can point me to the books.  
  
Thanks, Nityanand
