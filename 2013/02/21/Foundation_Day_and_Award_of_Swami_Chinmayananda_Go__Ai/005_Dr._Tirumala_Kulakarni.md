Dears

  

Congrats to both, Dr. Srinivas Varakhedi, the recipient, and CIF the giver for their unique feat.

  

Sri Varakhedi is really one of the best scholars of our time having a deep knowledge of Shastras as well as a good administrative personality.

  

At the same time CIF has started a very good method of encouraging the Sanskrit scholars.
