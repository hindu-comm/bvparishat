> >   
> > 3. Always go from what is known to what is new.  
> >   
> > 4. Understanding works better than memorisation in this Age. > > Learning by  
> > heart should only take up 10 percent of the mental work, rather than > > the 90  
> > percent rote learning in Sanskrit up to the recent present.  
> >   
> > 5. Don’t teach words and endings in isolation; teach them in the > > context of  
> > a sentence as the sentence is the smallest meaningful unit in > > language.  
> >   
> > 6. Any tedious memory work which cannot be avoided should be taught > > in a  
> > song.  
> >   
> > 7. Do not teach grammatical terms. Just as we don’t need to know > > about the  
> > carburetor, when we learn to drive a car.  
> >   
> > 8. The course should be finished in two years by an average > > student  
> > according to Narendra. This may be a little optimistic given that we > > are a  
> > little out of the loop not living in India, which is still > > Sanskrit’s

> >
