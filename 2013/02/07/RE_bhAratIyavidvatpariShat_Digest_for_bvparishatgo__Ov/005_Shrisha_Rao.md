\> As per my knowledge, Ph.D. is not given for mere "\< Transforming the text from a manuscript> to a \< Keyed in Text in a electronic page readable mode / transliteration modality \>". Critical editing accompanies a well study in the beginning. Critical editing itself is an extra ordinary exercise if done properly.  
  

It may well be, but it is hardly deserving of a Ph.D. unless there is a fundamental analytical contribution -- a doctoral student should be writing a new substantial scholarly text as his dissertation, not editing an existing one. It is one thing to provide new insights by improving the state of the art of the theory and knowledge on a topic, and another to apply well-known techniques like editing. In principle, the work done for an earned doctorate should be publishable in a quality research journal of the discipline. (The UGC guideline that a doctoral student publish a journal paper is well intentioned but is too often either ignored or cynically subverted.)  
  
Unfortunately, in many cases in India doctorates are awarded (not only in Sanskrit but in other subjects/disciplines as well) for non-research work. For instance, people have received Ph.D. degrees in geography for applying well-known techniques in geomorphology (with no new insights) to yet another river valley, etc. (That is, of course, when there is even a paltry attempt to earn the doctorate at all rather than giving unearned "honorary" doctorates as often happens with film stars, politicians, etc.)

It is to be pondered whether this is truly impressive by international standards. One cannot be surprised at the world at large not giving Sanskrit studies the respect it deserves, if there are people who title themselves as विद्वान् or विद्यावारिधि but whose scholarly output does not command respect (except perhaps within a small coterie of admirers). There already are significant challenges to Sanskrit in terms of social attitudes, political opposition, etc., and it surely does not help to have demonstrably lower standards for academic scholarship.

Quite good perhaps, but hundreds of new works with unique insights would assuredly have been even better.
