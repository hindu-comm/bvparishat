Respected Scholars,

  
I totally agree with Dr Shirish Rao that Ph.D. only needs to be awarded for the original contributions in the respective field and mere editing.  
  
If this is the current state of affairs; then that is really sad.  
  

This list is a cream of Sanskrit scholars, and some of them have done significant contributions in their field.

  

If we ask the question who is responsible then the answer has to be "I am" , "You are" and "We are". (Justice Warren Burger)  

  
If scholars cannot do any thing and will not do anything about it, then will there be no hope ?!  
  
With best wishes for Sanskrit  
  
Dr Yadu
