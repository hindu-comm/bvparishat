As per my knowledge, Ph.D. is not given for mere "\< Transforming the text from a manuscript> to a \< Keyed in Text in a electronic page readable mode / transliteration modality \>". Critical editing accompanies a well study in the beginning. Critical editing itself is an extra ordinary exercise if done properly. Keeping the flaws in the mind, recently 15-21 days special course has been made compulsory. As the result of this opportunity, hundreds of manuscripts are critically edited and made available.

  

I urge the authorities who are members in this forum to clarify what was intended by respective institutions/universities while accepting \`Critical Editing' not \`mere editing' as one of the criteria for Ph.D. degree, which is no where in the world elsewhere.
