That is a very pertinent observation. Nowhere in the world, in any subject, is a doctorate (other than a professional doctorate like a J.D. or M.D.) given for mere editing work. It stands to reason that Ph.D. standards in Sanskrit universities are seriously wanting, which in turn has the unfortunate but unavoidable consequence that many people with such नाम के वास्ते Ph.D. degrees in Sanskrit are actually quite incompetent to do real research because they have never done it in the past.
