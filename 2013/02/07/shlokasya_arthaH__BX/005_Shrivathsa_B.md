 The number pi is not a "rational" number. rational numbers are those which can be written as a ratio of two integers. i.e.  

rational number = can be represented as a fraction of two integers (or as a decimal).  
  

 Pi is not a rational number. the impression of it being a ratio of 22 and 7 is a wrong notion drilled into our minds when we are young. ratio of 22 and 7 is only an approximation of pi.
