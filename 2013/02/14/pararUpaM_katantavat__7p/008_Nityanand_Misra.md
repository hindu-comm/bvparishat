Agreed. One minor comment - either reordering of the गण or a repetition of शकल is sufficient. Both reordering and repetition are not required.  

1.  Reordering - as suggested by Patanjali along with interpretation of
    कतन्त and कण्वादि as एकशेष to include शकल (which is the is "buffer
    state" or "no man's land" between कत and कण्व) in both लोहितादिकतन्त
    and कण्वादि. Once this is done, repetition is not required. 2.  Repetition - another entry of शकल can be added anywhere between
    लोहित and कत, and कतन्त and कण्वादि can be interpreted as simple
    बहुव्रीहि so that शकल is both both लोहितादिकतन्त and कण्वादि. Once
    this is done, reordering is not required.  

So either reordering or repetition would account for both शाकल्यायनी (=शकलस्य गोत्रापत्यं स्त्री) and शाकलाः (=शाकल्यस्य च्छात्राः) as Paninian. Usually Katyayana's Varttikas make such extensions to account for popular forms as Paninian.  

In statistical terms, this is like adding more variables to a model which always increases the R-square.
