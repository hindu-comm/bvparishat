Thanks. Actually this is the sense in which the sAyaNa commentary is for the word सुब्रह्मण्योम्.....in the aruNa prashna of the taittiriya AraNyaka 1.12: शोभनं ब्रह्म सुब्रह्म वेदः *तस्मै हितः* सुब्रह्मण्यः इन्द्रः । (this mantra is in praise of the devatA IndraH)  
  
A scholar told me in private that on the basis of the rule 'तत्र साधुः’ we can give the derivation: ब्रह्मणि साधुः with some more additions of यत् we get शोभनः ब्रह्मण्यः सुब्रह्मण्यः to mean 'He who is an exalted BrahmajnAni.' With this meaning one can appreciate the Lord SubrahmaNya as one who is capable of bestowing even brahmajnAnam on His devotee.  
  
I just found this recent discussion in this very forum:
