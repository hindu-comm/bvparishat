Dear friends,  
  
I understand that there is an anecdote saying that there was a time when the brahmins of the southern of India needed a good teacher, who himself was good brahmin. Lord Shiva filled that need by sending his own son Kartikeya to that region and that is how Lord Kartikeya is known as Sri Subrahmanyam.
