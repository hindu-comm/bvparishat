Namaste,  
  
It is not proper to do away with the Sidereal calendar as Mr. Kaul is trying to do. The Vamana purana clearly mentions the definition of the Rashis and the Nakshatras and Mr. Kaul completely ignores that. He thinks that the nakshatras move to nullify the effects of the precession of the Earth and that is not acceptable to the people who know about the precession of the Earth. Varaha Mihira in his Brihat Samhita clearly exhorts us to recognise the precessional movement of the earth and to make the necessary corrections through astronomical observations.  
  
Further thanks to the Sidereal calendar, which have been followed by the Hindus from time immemorial, that we have the data to date past events. The dates of Lord Buddha and that of Kanishka had been found by Prof Narahari Achar and these correspond to what is given in the puranic chronology.
