Dear Shri Kaul,  
  
Currently, there are many debates among PanchAnga makers and religious institutions, including Maths and temples, such as the nirayana vs. sAyana debate, the sUrya siddhAnta vs. dRggaNita/AryabhaTIya debate, chAndramAna vs. sauramAna debate, etc. As a result, the same festival could be observed on different dates. For example, the Krishna JanmAShTami is accepted to be on the eighth day of the dark fortnight of shrAvaNa (or bhAdrapada in the north). However, some institutions observe it on the eighth day of the dark fortnight whenever the Sun is in Simha. It is not easy to achieve consensus among all the parties. Perhaps, the best option is to convince some leading institutions to accept a reformed calendar.  
  
Regards,  
  
Anand
