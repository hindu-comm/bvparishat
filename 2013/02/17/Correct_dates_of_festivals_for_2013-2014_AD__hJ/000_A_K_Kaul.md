Dear friends,

Jai Shri Ram!

Best wishes for the ensuing Vasanta Ritu, which is known as the day of *Sonta Thali* in Kashmir, as *Sont* i.e. Vasanta Ritu starts from that date!

All the panchangas, including the Sarkaari one i.e. Rashtriya Panchanga, tell us that Vasanta Ritu will start from February 18, 2013.

(BTW, ironically, these very panchangas advised us to celebrate Vasanta Panchami on February 15, 2013, that is three days before the actual Vasanta Ritu had started!

No wonder there were mishaps in Kumbha Mela at Allahabad because of celebrating festivals on wrong days!)

Herewith the list of correct dates of some festivals and fairs for the period February 18, 2013---the start of Vasanta Ritu---Madhu Masa----of the current year---till the Vasanta Sampaat (Vernal Equinox) of the year 2014.

As usual, these are based on Shri Mohan Krity Arsha Tithi Patrak of Shri Darshaneya Lokesh, C-276, Gama-1, Greater Noida-201310 (UP), Mobile No. 09412354036.

A Tamil-cum-English version of that Tithi-Patrak is available with Shri T. V. Sivaraman,

Shri Sivaraman has been able to get the blessings of several Jagadgurus for this reformed calendar, as will be evident from the attached title-page and back cover of the "reformed Sanathancalendar" that he had very kindly sent me.

As you would be aware, these festivals are based on the Vedic canon of Ritus i.e. Vasanta etc. seasons Vedic Madhu, Madhava etc. months, Pauranic and Siddhantic canon of Rashis, and the actual position of junction-stars irrespective of their relation with their namesake nakshatras.

Thus it can be safely said that these festivals etc. are based on the real Hindu ethos and not on the whims and fancies of some "jyotishis".

Similarly, this is also the real co-ordinated calendar, since it co-ordinates the Vedic months Madhu, Madhava etc. with seasons and
adhika-masa etc. have been decided accordingly on the basis of seasonal months, whereas a lunar nakshatra is supposed to start from the moment of its actual conjunction with the Junction Star of that name---though personally I would appreciate if the Junction star is taken as the middle of the relevant nakshatra division (Hope Shri Darshaney Lokesh is listening!)

As will be evident from the attached "stars-2013" paper, these junction stars have absolutely nothing to do with either their namesake equal nakshatra divisions or with any Mesha, Vrisha etc. Rashis, whether the so called saayana or the so called niraayana, as both the types of equal divisions of Rashis as well as nakshatras are imaginary and the real Fixed stars cannot be co-ordinated with any imaginary division, much less some plus-minus-six-degree division, which is a ludicrous compromise of trying to metamorphose imaginary divisions into real Fixed stars!

As such, it is up to us as to what type of calendar we choose and why!

Jai Shri Ram!

PS

The Junction stars of the attached paper have been calculated from Vasitshha Program, which anybody can download from
