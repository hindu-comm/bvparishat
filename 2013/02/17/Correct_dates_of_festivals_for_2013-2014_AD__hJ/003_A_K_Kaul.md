Dear Prof. Jha,

Jai Shri Ram!

It is indeed a pleasure to see such a warm response from a Professor of Sanskrit to an otherwise thankless task of "Reforming the deformed Vedic calendar" for which I have been striving for the last more than thirty years.

I am attaching a few documents herewith. These will give you some idea as to the basis of my views about the real Hindu calendar.

Attachments:

1. Representation (to the ex-President APJ Kalam)

2. Shankar2 (English translation of representation to Jagadguru Shankaracharyas)

3\. PAC3 (Representation to IndiaMeteorologicalDept. etc.)

4. Criteria for Festivals

5. Aadesha-patra (aadesha patra of Jagadguru Shankaracharya of Dwarka that only---so called---saayana rashis are to be followed for festivals etc.)

6\. Rotary viz. "Vedic astrology the greatest fraud on the Vedas"

7. Rashis & Jyotish----A startling fact that if at all any rashichakra is to be used for festivals etc., it must be so called saayana!

8. Ramanji doc.---a self eloquent mail that was sent to KPandit forum!

As will be clear from the attachment "Ramanji", it is actually like sailing against the tide as well as ebb!

Of late, however, there has been an awakening after all and quite a few people have started realizing that we are really celebrating all our festivals and muhurtas on wrong days, as a result of which there has been a very good response to both the *Mohan Aarsha Tithi Patrak* in Hindi and "Reformed Sanathana Calendar" in Tamil-cum-English, but some vested interests are making all types of propaganda that some sort of Gregorian calendar is being thrust on the Hindu community in the name of "reformed calendar", for which purpose we are being paid by some missionaries (sic!)!

You being a Sanskrit scholar and quite well versed in the Vedic, Pauranic and siddhantic ethos of the Hindu culture, I would request you to kindly take time out and go through all these papers so that we can compare notes later.

And of course, views from other members of the "*vidvat parishat*" and other forums also will be equally appreciated, since unless such issues are discussed threadbare, we will never be able to sift grain from thechaff and put the derailed Hindu calendar back on the right track!

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!

A K Kaul
