Dear Sirs,  
  
Sri Subrahmanian has said perfectly well regarding the  
pancaaagni-tapas. Coming to the panchaagnula, the surname in AP, the  
five sacred fires are the well known trEtaagni-s viz. gaarhapatya,  
aahavaneeya and dakShiNa and the other two: sabhya and aavasathya  
  
regards  
  
  
ganesh
