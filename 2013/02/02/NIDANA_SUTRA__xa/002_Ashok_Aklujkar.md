Can somebody tell me how to get the book NidAna SUtra, if it is published, its publisher's address.  
  

The work is published by Meharchand Lachhmandas, Oriental & Foreign Booksellers, 2736, Kucha Chailan, Daryaganf, Delhi-6 (India). Sale Depot: Street No. 1, 1 Ansari Road, Daryaganj, Delhi-6. This 1971 publication is actually a reprint of a 1939 publication, although MLOFB does not so specify explicitly (a misleading habit which Indian publishers in particular must shake off). The editor K.N. Bhatnagar has given us an excellent production.
