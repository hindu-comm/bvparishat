Respected Professor Iyengar,  
Let me make a small correction: the term वासिष्ट is used for blood (वसा serum or marrow of the flesh), but I know your intention is on वसिष्ठ and वासिष्ठाः. वासिष्ठाः in plural representing all seven sages. वशवतां वशिनां श्रेष्ठः। वशवत् + इष्ठन्। "विन्मतोर्लुक्।" ५। ३। ६५। वशिष्ठः। वसिष्ठः। पृषोदरादित्वात् शस्य सः। I am attaching a pdf which is downloaded, ignore please if you have already read it. There is a discussion on the Saptarshi-s and Maghaa based on the Puranas.  
I am quoting some parts from the attached pdf:  
"The belief in India in a revolution of the Great Bear is mentioned not in treaties on astronomy or even of astrology but in texts giving chronology. It appears under this title in Brihatsanhita XIII, 3-4 and in several Puranas (Vishnu Puran IV, 24.105-1062, Matsya Puran, 273, 42-44, Vaayu Puran 99,421-423, Bhagwad Puran, XII, 2.27-32). Utpala, the commentator on the Brihatsamhita, cites about this subject a verse from Vriddha Garga (c.f. P V Kane, History of Dharmashastra, vol V, Part 1, page 520). According to this theory, the seven rishis (sages) would turn from nakshatra to nakshatra, remaining 100 years in each of these 27 constellations. Several important events of that era are dated using this concept of Saptarshi era. At the time of the reign of Yudhishthira or of the accession of Parikshita or of the death of Krishna, which marks the beginning of Kaliyuga, the seven rishis would have been in Magha (Regulus), in the Leo constellation. One sometimes calculated the centuries, separating 2 reigns by noting from which nakshatra to which other one have the 7 rishis passed during the interval."  
I do not know about the standard of this attached paper and that I request you judge.  
I do not know whether it is possible to read in between the lines of the sentence provided by you too. Paraashara is heard to be the composer of Upapurana-s but Puranas are attributed Vyasa, his son.  
Regards,  
Narayanan
