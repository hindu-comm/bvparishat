Respected Professor Iyengar,

Thanks a lot for the pdf. I have gone through it but could not make any clue out of it. I hope Dr. Ramanujan can make a meaning out of it. The term उपतापः is for पीडा अशुभः। The southern stars of मघाः are δ, γ and η (दक्षिणताराः), and while the उपताप happens these southern stars in lower line then the वासिष्ठाः are being suffered.  

What the green line between Regulus and Denebola which pass through ϑ indicates?

Panini finds that in छन्दस् (Vedic) पुनर्वसुः is singular although there are two stars, in classical it should be पुनर्वसू (dual).

There are 25 Paninian (in अष्टाध्यायी) Rules directly naming a few constellations, but not all. Neither मघाः nor शतभिषक् is seen in अष्टाध्यायी. But the Vedic names are maintained like प्रोष्ठपद for भाद्रपद, श्रविष्ठा for धनिष्ठा and तिष्य for पुष्य etc. Panini is not mentioning ज्येष्ठा but I don't is there any other Vedic name existing for it.

I am not understanding "

एका शतभिषा γ Aquarii is a single star constellation has nothing to do with hundred. शतभिषज्। स्त्री०। शतं भिषज इव तारा यत्र। शतभिषा। आ०। स्त्री०। शतं भिषज इव तारा यत्र। These etymologies do not match the number hundred has something to do there, as it being a bahuvrihi compound. File:Aquarius constellation map.svg is not giving any hint of hundred there.

I am confusing with एका ज्येष्ठा and α, σ, and τ Scorpionis.  

Now it is clear to me that षण् मघाः is indicating α, η, γ, ζ, μ, ε Leonis. Thanks you, Sir.

Regards,

Narayanan
