Dear Dr.Naryanan,  
Thanks for your response. But there is no evidence anywhere in the concerned ancient literature to take वासिष्ठाः to mean the सप्तर्षि
constellation or group. If you have come across any hard evidence for your equation please shrare the same. The word directly means the progeny of वसिष्ठ. This could refer to an ethnic group in terms of a गोत्र-प्रवर lineage.  
  
The paper attached and the problem addressed by the TIFR authors is well known to me. It does not throw light on my question. The observed movement of Saptarshi initially could be due to precession but later notionally used for counting years in terms of star names. There are references to the saptarshi-caara and an era in several texts (not just puraaNas), but with no unique solution. Taking Maghaa as star Regulus is an approximation. The ancient Hindu constellation consisted of six stars. In ancient literature, starting with RV (aghaasu), maghaa is usually seen in the plural as मघासु. The statement of Vr.Garga runs: आसन् मघासु मुनयः ...
