Dear Dr.Narayanan,  
Thanks for taking the discussion further, but I get a feeling we may  
be talking from different stand points. Tradition is a diffuse  
concept; like a tree it grows wide and vast and hence to go to the  
roots is a tough exercise. Now, to be more specific:

\> We started from Svaati (Nishthyaa), then came to Maghaa-Vaasishtha and reaching to Rohini through \>Jyeshtha. Yes, Sir, we may need to analyse each asterism on the contexts of Vedic statements and \>their commentaries having the etymological analysis on each of the terminology.  

I wish some one like you takes up this exercise and writes a scholarly  
monograph on "Nakshatra Lore of Vedic Hindus" without mixing up  
siddhantic astronomy and horoscope astrology.

\> The two out of fourteen Devanakshatras: षट् कृत्तिकाः Pleiades, एका रोहिणी-Aldebaran, and what is the \>modern scientific concept regarding the number of stars attributed each to these asterism?, as our \>tradition informs that six and one respectively.

Our tradition is not monolithic or single. It is diverse as I wrote  
above, at least that is my opinion. RV seems to indicate Krittikas as  
seven in number. Nakshatreshti of TB names the seven mothers:Ambā,  
Dulā, Nitatnī, Abhrayantī; Meghayantī; Vars.ayantī, and Cupun.ikā. But  
Ekagnikanda like AVP says Kr's are six in number.

\> Regarding the terms रोहिणी and ज्येष्ठा \[कौशिकी ज्येष्ठा-(अथर्ववेदपरिशिष्टम्- नक्षत्रकल्पः-१.३.१), and इन्द्रस्य रोहिणी। \>(5.1.4)-BB-इन्द्रस्य रोहिणी ज्येष्ठा। इन्द्रः शूरः। तस्य सङ्ग्रामे रोहणम्। Jyeshtha stimulates Indra. Indra is \>brave/warrior. His growing over is on the battle.\] are not used for each other, I feel, as \>etymologically the term रोहिणी (growing over) attributes ज्येष्ठा but not the synonym. Why? The TB \>5.2.12 says: यानि देवनक्षत्राणि तानि दक्षिणेन परियन्ति। यानि यमनक्षत्राणि तान्युत्तरेण। The constellation  
\> रोहिणी is second among the fourteen Devanakshatras (those travelling towards south), but \>constellation ज्येष्ठा is second among the thirteen Yamanakshatras (those travelling towards north).  
\> मातृभ्यो भरण्यः वसिष्ठः कश्यप आदित्यश्चन्द्रमा ब्रह्माणो नक्षत्रेषु।। (अथर्ववेदपरिशिष्टम्- नक्षत्रकल्पः-१.३.१). So, may we assume, Sir that वासिष्ठाः (as they originated from मातृभ्यः) are the three भरणी-s, वसिष्ठः(Big Dopper/Ursa Major, but Arundhati is not mentioned), कश्यपः (The Diety Prajapati to Rohini-Aldebaran), आदित्यः(Lord of Krttika), चन्द्रमाः (Lord of Rohini)? Are these if afflicted what Kashyapa is called in modern astronomy? काश्यप्युत्तरा (अषाढा) (उत्तरा अषाढा உத்திராடம் ζ and σ Sagittarii) is also mentioned. I request a \>clear advice from you.

My suggestion (not advice as I am not a great Vedic scholar)is please  
carefully read BG Tilak's ORION. Tilak was by every standard a Great  
Vedic scholar who combined Mimamsa, Grammar, astronomy and beyond all  
of these, sound reasoning that is Nyaaya! Unless we have a  
chronological perspective of Vedic texts discussions could be  
confusing, particularly about ancient astronomical concepts.  
My understanding of AVP is, it represents a tradition somewhat  
different from the other Vedic samhita & brahmanas. In 1.3.1 of AVP  
the names are of Ris.i families associated with the nakshatras. So  
Agnives'ya I understand to be a proper name. At the end it mentions  
about Mothers (krittika), BharaNi etc as Brahmans among the naksatras.  
Sun and Moon are also mentioned. Perhaps this was an esoteric concept.  
Why you are singling out Kashyapa? To the best of my knowledge he is  
not the one and only Prajapati. The celestial nature of Kashyapa is  
not clear to me from the texts I have read. From Tai AraNyaka I have  
conjectured that Kashyapa was most likely a circumpolar star or  
constellation, because he does not leave Meru. (But let us not mix up  
too many things in one go.)

\> आग्निवेश्यः कृत्तिकारोहिण्यौ। (अथर्ववेदपरिशिष्टम्- नक्षत्रकल्पः-१.३.१). Krttika is six-starred and Rohini is a single .starred constellations. षट् कृत्तिकाः Pleiades, एका रोहिणी-Aldebaran, having Agni, the god of fire being the diety (आग्निवेश्यः). अग्निः विशति अङ्गमिति। (पदरुजविशस्पृशो घञ् ३.३.१६)। अग्निवेशः यासां अस्ति ताः अग्निवेश्यः \>कृत्तिकारोहिण्यौ as the Sun and Moon having their dieties.

Perhaps we are following different AVP texts. My version of Bolling &  
Negelein does not combine Krittikaa and RohiNi as कृत्तिकारोहिण्यौ.  
This has to be critically verified with some original manuscripts if  
available.

\>अग्नेः कृत्तिकाः। शुक्रं परस्ताज्ज्योतिरवस्तात्।(5.1.1), Bhattabhaskara comments: अग्नेः  
\> कृत्तिकाः स्वभूताः। यद्वा-अग्नेरेव स्वरूपं कृत्तिकादिनक्षत्रं नाम, अग्निरेव कृत्तिकात्मना वर्तत इति। शुक्रं परस्तात् (light above) ज्योतिरवस्तात् (flame below).  
\> प्रजापते रोहिणी। आपः परस्तादोषधयोऽवस्तात्। (5.1.1), BB comments: रोहणं (proceeding from) सृष्टिः। तत्र प्रजापतेः (may \>we guess Kashyapa??) सृजतः त्रयं भवति, परस्तादापः (waters above) सर्वस्य कारणभूताः। मध्ये कालात्मिका रोहणशक्तिः \>(power of proceeding in the form of time in the middle)। अवस्तादोषधयः (the plants below) \>सर्वविकाराणामुपलक्षणम् (characteristic sign of change of nature)। यदेतत्त्रयं भवति तदा सृष्टं दृश्यते।

I usually the commentaries of both BB and S on YV texts before  
bringing up a discussion. BB is more difficult (for me) but he being  
ancient than the other is very important. I did not follow why you are  
quoting the commentaries on Krittika here. This in no way relates to  
my primary question, why in some parts of Taittiriya texts Jyeshtha  
was also referred as RohiNi. I never meant that they did not know the  
difference in their celestial locations.

\> There is no difference appear in meaning what Sayana said, as you had quoted it: "This was the \>statement of Devas w.r.t their battle with Asuras. Devas say: we killed the eldest of them on this \>day that is on Jyes.t.hA nakshatra. Hence it is called Jyes.t.haghnI abbreviated as Jyes.t.hA." \>The same idea is conveyed from the Bhattabhaskara comments, as Dr. Ramanujan was pointing out \>about the निर्धारणषष्ठी, optionally as locative and genitive, and by the way "on the day of Jyes.t.hA \>nakshatra" is justified.

Nice ! we are on the same page here but may be looking from different  
perspectives. When you have time please do read Tilak's Orion and post  
your opinion on the way Tilak handles Deva and Yama nakshatras. Also  
please find out whether Deva N's were 14 or just 13 and half, so that  
Vis'aakha was that which got divided!
