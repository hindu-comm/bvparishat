Respected Professor Iyengar,  
You had earlier posted (on 6th February): "If you have any information on the nakshatra Jyes.t.hA from grammar or other ancient (i.e. pre-Varaaha Mihira) texts please let me know."  
Here is some information:  
ज्येष्ठमेषामधिष्मेति। तज्ज्येष्ठघ्नी। (The Taittiriya Brahmana 1.5.13)  
Bhattabhaskara comments on these: एषां असुराणां ज्येष्ठं प्रधानं अवधिष्मेति। यत्रामन्यन्त सा ज्येष्ठघ्नी ज्येष्ठी ज्येष्ठा। एकदेशो लुप्यते यथा। भीमसेनो भीम इति। अमनुष्यकर्तृके च (३.२.५३) इति टक्।  
From these we get that ज्येष्ठघ्नी, ज्येष्ठी and ज्येष्ठा are the names for α, σ, and τ Scorpionis. Here the meaning for ज्येष्ठघ्नी is clearly explained as: We have killed the chief/eldest of demons and where ज्येष्ठघ्नी (the killer of the eldest) has been considered. There are partial elisions as: ज्येष्ठी and ज्येष्ठा like भीमः for भीमसेनः। In the form घ्न for killing (अवधिष्म-we killed) after ज्येष्ठ the suffix टक् (effectively अ) is due an non-human action of killing. That is why अमनुष्यकर्तृके च (३.२.५३) has been quoted.   
Bhattabhaskara also sees that the term अनूराधानां as असुराणाम्। वयं अन्वरात्स्म (The gods claim that we have accumulated the war weapons) is making "that is why we are Anooraadha-s" and the constelletion is named by that.  
With the devine constellations the gods defeated the demons, and with the Yama constellations they reduced the strength of demons too.  
The term Jyeshthaa is derived from वृद्ध/ प्रशस्य has been substituted as ज्य + इष्ठन् + टाप्। The feminine suffix changes in the case of Jyeshthii as: ज्य + इष्ठन् + ङीप्। having the meaning of honourable or elder or senior. The suffix इष्ठन् is to show extra-ordinary.  
Regards,
