Dear Dr.Narayanan,and Dr.Ramanujan,

it appears for each nakshatra a separate discussion would be necessary. I am amazed at the details as also at the apparently conflicting views present in the canonical texts. First let me make a short statement aboutमघाः. Here दक्षिणतारोपातापhas to be broken asदक्षिणतारायाः उपतापः in singular. IMHO this is the विवक्षा of Paraas'ara. Henceवासिष्ठाः are affected only when the single star Regulus (alpha-Leonis in modern terminology) is afflicted. The figure attached was a modern one from wikipedia.

  

Now about Jyes.t.hA: Saayan.a in his Tai Br. Bhashya seems to say "This was the statement of Devas w.r.t their battle with Asuras. Devas say: we killed the eldest of them on this day that is on Jyes.t.hA nakshatra. Hence it is called Jyes.t.haghnI abbreviated as Jyes.t.hA." I haven't fully followed BB's commentary posted. I have to read it again and again! Devanakshatras are: Krittikaa to vis'aakha. Yama nakshatras are from anuraadhA to apabharan.I. (TB 1.5.2). I desired a discussion since in Tai.Sam (4.4.10) and also in TB (1.5.1) this star is called रोहिणी . It appears in the relatively more ancient period two nakshatras were known by the same name. Curiously both occupied no.2 position in the Deva and Yama list. I await further discussion.

regards

RN Iyengar
