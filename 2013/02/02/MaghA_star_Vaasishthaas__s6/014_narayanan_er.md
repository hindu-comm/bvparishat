Respected Professor Iyengar,  
I am really sorry to say that I make mistakes due to oversight, by depending too much on internet documents etc., as I do not have the printed texts with me and while we converse, though the mistakes committed by me are unintended.  
Thank you very much for the advice to read BGTilak's Orion. I have a scanned pdf copy of the Orion or Researches into the Antiquity of the Vedas-1893.  
There are two sites matching with your reading in the net, making sure that 1. āgniveśyaḥ kṛttikāḥ and 2. Rohiṇī ānurohiṇī.  
The Roman reading is from: \<<http://fiindolo.sub.uni-goettingen.de/gretil/1_sanskr/1_veda/5_vedang/2_paris/avpari_u.htm>\>(AVParis_1,3.1) āgniveśyaḥ kṛttikā rohiṇy ānurohiṇī śvetāyinaṃ mṛgaśira.......... (George Melville Bolling and Julius von Negelein's readings). I think the print/reprint text is from Chowkhabha Orientalia, 1976, and I have not read it.  
The Devanagari is from:\<[sanskritworld.in/public/assets/download.php?f=book...txt..](http://sanskritworld.in/public/assets/download.php?f=book...txt..).>आग्निवेश्यः कृत्तिका रोहिण्यानुरोहिणी श्वेतायिनं मृगशिर...........  
So, it is clear to me that षट् कृत्तिकाः the Pleiades having Taygeta, Maia, Celaeno, Electra, Alcyone and Merope are brightest stars of the group appear, and एका रोहिणी-Aldebaran-The Arabic: al-dabarān-the follower-presumably because this bright star appears to follow the Pleiades-आनुरोहिणी (रोहणमनुगतम्। प्रादिसमासः। अनुरोहण+अण्+ङीष्-गौरादिः)  
Tilak translates Prajapati as Orion and equals ṛṣya (antelope) with Prajapati. Postings on this topic will continue. Where we are heading, Sir, with Maghā, Kṛttikāḥ and Viśākha's division etc.  
Regards,  
Narayanan
