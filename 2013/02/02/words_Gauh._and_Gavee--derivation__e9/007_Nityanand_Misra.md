Sorry for the late reply as I was travelling this week.

As Dr. Bhat has pointed out, both examples above satisfy गोरतद्धितलुकि (5-4-92) and the टच् is then mandatory. I have not seen theword गवी used independently or as पूर्वपद of तत्पुरुष समास. The गोसहस्रनामस्तोत्रम् of Jagadguru Rambhadracharya has names like गवीशा (name 4) and गवीड्या (name 9) both of which are षष्ठी तत्पुरुष समास but in these cases it is the अयादिसन्धि (गो + ईशा = गवीशा, गो + ईड्या = गवीड्या) which results inthe वर्णसमुदाय गवी coming at the beginning. Otherwise it is only at the end of तत्पुरुष as in the case of कामगवी (name 176 in गोसहस्रनामस्तोत्रम्).



It will become more clear if you can cite the source and quote the context of the above examples with the gloss or commentary (if any). The first one उद्योत्करगवीनां appears to mean "of the speeches of उद्योत्कर (the author of न्यायवार्त्तिक?)". I am not able to make out what कृष्णगवीद्व्यमूल्यक may mean - though the structure is similar to the example of पञ्चगवधनः in the LSK which is a त्रिपदबहुव्रीहि with पञ्चगो as the अवान्तरतत्पुरुष.

In the अष्टाध्यायी, the अधिकार of स्त्रियाम् (4-1-3) goes from अजाद्यतष्टाप्‌ (4-1-4) till दैवयज्ञिशौचिवृक्षिसात्यमुग्रिकाण्ठेविद्धिभ्योऽन्यतरस्याम् (4-1-81). In all the 78 Sutras, I do not remember any Sutra specifying any of the eight feminine suffixes (टाप्, डाप्, चाप्, ङीप्, ङीष्, ङीन्, ऊङ्, ति) from an ओदन्त (ओकारान्त) or गोपध प्रातिपदिक. Panini has not ordained any suffix from गो in the विवक्षा of स्त्रीत्व. Therefore, गो is both masculine and feminine, as no suffix is to be added for स्त्रीत्वविवक्षा.गौः can thus mean a bull or a cow and the context or the adjectives should make the meaning clear. The लिङ्गानुशासन is to be considered when considering other meanings of गो, and the following reference from केशव is useful



गौर्नादित्ये बलीवर्दे किरणक्रतुभेदयोः।

स्त्री तु स्याद्दिशि भारत्यां भूमौ च सुरभावपि।

नृस्त्रियोः स्वर्गवज्राम्बुरश्मिदृग्बाणलोमसु।

The answer to this is that though Panini has not ordained any suffix in स्त्रीत्वविवक्षा from गो (ओकारान्त or गोपध प्रातिपदिक), the case for उस्रेशगव, उद्योत्करगव, कष्णगव, etc is different. After applying the mandatory टच्, theप्रातिपदिक is not गोपध and ओकारान्त, but itis not टजन्त, वोपध and अकारान्त, hence the स्त्री suffixes from the corresponding Sutras are now applicable. If the विवक्षा is to refer tosomething feminine among the meanings of गो in स्त्रियाम् (दिक्, भारती, भूमि, सुरभी) or नृस्त्रियोः(स्वर्ग, वज्र, अम्बु, रश्मि, दृक्, बाण, लोम), then there will be  
ङीप् fromटिड्ढाणञ्द्वयसज्दघ्नञ्मात्रच्तयप्ठक्ठञ्कञ्क्वरपः (4-1-14) as Dr. Bhat has mentioned. If the intended meaning of गो (now गव) is वाक्, which is the meaning of गो in feminine, then the ङीप् is mandatory. If the the intended meaning of गो (now गव) is a ray of light, then ङीप् is optional since गो stands for किरण/रश्मि in both masculine and feminine as the verse from केशव above shows.



With the male प्रातिपदिक उद्योत्करगव, the षष्ठी बहुवचन would be उद्योत्करगवानाम्. However this cannot mean the "of the speeches of उद्योत्कर" as गो does not mean वाक् in masculine as per कोश.



With the female प्रातिपदिक उद्योत्करगवी, the षष्ठी बहुवचन would be उद्योत्करगवीनाम्. Here the meaning "of the speeches of उद्योत्कर" is possible.  

Dr. Bhat and other scholars can correct me if I am wrong.
