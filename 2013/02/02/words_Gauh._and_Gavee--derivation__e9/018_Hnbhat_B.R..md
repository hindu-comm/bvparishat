गवी  
  
(H2) गव \[p= 351,2\] \[p= 1326,2\] \[L=64340\] mf(ई)n. in comp. before a word beginning with a vowel (\[ Pa1n2. 6-1 , 123 f.\]) and ifc. (\[v , 4 , 92 and vi , 2 , 72 ; f(ई). cf. गुरु-गव्/ई , ब्रह्म-गवी , ब्राह्मण- , भिल्ल- , स्त्री-\]) for ग्/ओ , a cow , cattle (cf. षड्-गव्/अ , द्वादश-गव्/अ &c )

  

This entry from the Monier Williams seems to be the basis for the repeated request for the "vyutpatti" of "गव" + ई - गवी.

  

(H2B) गवी \[L=64340.1\] f. ifc. for ग्/ओ , a cow , cattle (» before)

(H2B) गव \[L=64340.2\] f. speech S3is3. ii , 68.  

(H2) गवी \[p= 351,3\] \[L=64413\] f. of °व q.v.

  

which considers " gava" and "गवी" as independent words as it appears to be according to western grammarians of Sanskrit Grammar.But as per Indian Grammarians, we gave seen it is derived as the समासान्त form for गो in so far as we have considered.

  

But this depends on the availability of this form as a free usage independently either in Lexicons or authentic texts. Anyhow let us hope for the best. The reference he gives from शिशुपालवध २.६८ is a clear example of समासान्त, for the word गो, as we accept its usage as the case of polysemy changing its gender.

  

निशम्य ताः ***शेषगवीर***भिधातुमधोक्षजः /

शिष्याय बृहतां प्रत्युः प्रस्तावमदिशद्दृशा //२.६८ //

  

and not considered by the Indian commentators as an independent usage. Scholars' opinion on this entry is solicited. It seems he has taken it as form for गो only when it means cow which is common meaning used in Indian European Languages and in other meanings than cow, he considers it as independent words गव and गवी which could not be explained by Paninan Standards as such as we have already seen.

  

Now Prof. Shankarji is free to adopt above and demand for independent "vyutpatti" for both the words गव and गवी found in the dictionary entry or look for some independent usage in classical or Vedic literature. If any found, it can be explained as जातिलक्षण ङीष् for जाति cows in general while गव is used in masculine, which was the objective from the beginning.
