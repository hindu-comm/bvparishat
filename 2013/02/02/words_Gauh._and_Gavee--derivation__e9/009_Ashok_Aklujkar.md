First, in this and the earlier related posts, udyotk... should be corrected to ud*d*yot*a*k.... Secondly, the reference indeed is to the Nyaaya-vaarttika author as guessed. The expression is used byVaacaspati-mi;sra. He also uses the expression ;srii-gautama-sugaviinaam in a variation of the verse. Please see sections 2.3a, 2.4a and 3.2 of the attached article published in2001. "The prologue and epilogue verses of Vaacaspati-mi;sra-I." *Rivista degli Studi Orientali* 73: 105-130.
