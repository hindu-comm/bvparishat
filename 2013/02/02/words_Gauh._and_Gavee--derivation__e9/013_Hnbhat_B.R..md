Leave the technical discussion of the form \*गवी. Please come up yourself with an authentic usage of isolated use of the word गवी in Sanskrit. As far as I can think of, there is no such isolated usage from the word गो in Sanskrit except in तत्पुरुष compound. If you can show the usage in Sanskrit either classical or Vedic usage, we can think of finding a "vyutpatti" for it using Sanskrit Grammar, if possible.

•raudro ***gavī***dhukaś caruḥ # KSA.5.18.  

  

also. The above is the Sanskrit word using the form गवी in the word "गवीधुका" as a variety.

  

The word गवीनी गवीनीक used as adjective

  

•atho eti gavīnike # AVŚ.9.8.7b.  

  

•vi yoniṃ vi gavīnike (TS.BŚ. gavīnyau; KS. parīṇaham) # AVŚ.1.11.5b; TS.3.3.10.1b; KS.13.9b; BŚ.14.14: 178.6b  

  

•asyā nāryā gavīnyoḥ # AVŚ.5.25.10b–13b; AVP.12.3.10b; 12.4.1b–4b. See asyāṃ nāryāṃ.  

  

•asyāṃ nāryāṃ (MG. nāryā, v.l. nāryāṃ) gavīnyām # RVKh.10.184.3b; ApMB.1.12.6b; MG.2.18.4b. See asyā nāryā.  

  

•pumāṁsaṃ garbham ādhattaṃ gavīnyoḥ # MS.1.3.12: 34.15; 4.6.3: 82.13.  

  

etc. usages are Vedic, and does not support any usage in isolation a word गवी except in compound.

  

The quotation by Mr. Ramanujam from Kashika, does not violate the "tatpurusha" mandatory rule of टच् and feminine form derived from it \*गवी. In the context of the explanation of प्रजन in the सूत्र, it makes the intended sense clear as the counterpart पुंगव is literally used in the meaning श्रेष्ठ, also. Anyhow it doesn't qualify by itself, suggest any independent usage. As already said,

  

गावी, गोणी, गोता, गोपोतलिका etc. are considered as अपभ्रंश- words derived from the Sanskrit word गो. But गवी is not listed among the अपभ्रंश words, not it is seen in the पाइअसद्दण्णओ, though other गावी, गोणो, गावी, etc. are attested in usage in Prakrit works, but without any derivation than the remote relation with Sanskrit forms.

  

Even if such usage is found, it can be taken as अव्युत्पन्न like many words like those derived from उणादिसूत्र, which are meant for dealing with such words.
