I agree with Dr. Bhat. Monier Williams is obviously wrong from the Paninian perspective in listing गवी under L=64340.2. Taking गवी as an independent प्रातिपदिक in शिशुपालवध 2/68 makes no sense at all. There is no possible अन्वय of शेष if गवी is taken as independent in the verse. Mallinatha's explanation of शेषगवीः is Paninian and I would go with him rather than Monier Williams.
