Respected Mishra-Mahaabhaagaah., you have propounded the Samasta Pada or Samasta-gavee word. My query was about only word 'Gavee' well used in Sanskrit pholosophical literature as 'Udyotakara-gaveenaam or 'Krishna-gavee -dvyamoolyaka' etc. I think Pullinga-Go worg should have either Jaati-lakshana Neesh or Pumyoga-lakshana Neesh. Please confirm it by your scholastic observation. Regards,
