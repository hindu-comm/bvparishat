What about the decision of Grammarian पाणिनि

  

परवल्लिङ्गं द्वन्द्वतत्पुरुषयोः (२।४।२६)

  

decides the लिङ्ग is the तत्पुरुष and गो in the स्त्रीलिङ्ग is not changed by the समासान्त. The समासान्त makes only the form उद्योतकरगव and not its लिङ्ग and for स्त्रीलिङ्ग it takes ङीष् only as the suffix is governed by "टिड्ढाणञ्" ४।१।१५ for feminine gender as टच् warrants ङीप् and not ङीष्। स्त्रीत्व of the the word is not dependent on the विवक्षा, but the gender of the second word गो inherent its meaning. Only the meaning in the compound is dependent on the विवक्षा and not the gender of the word. That is why the परवल्लिङ्ग operates. If the meaning was a bull, of उद्योतकर then it would have been उद्योतकरगवानाम्, like पुंगवानाम् where it cannot be otherwise. पुमान् च गौश्च - पुंगवः। There too if you want, it as a general word, श्रेष्ठवाचक, you can use the same पुंगवीनां गवाम्। टित् governs the ङीष्। otherwise he could have used only अच् suffix.

  

Please explain how "टिड्ढाणञ्" ४।१।१५" is not applicable in स्त्रीलिङ्ग for the word उद्योतकरगव? And what is the use of टित्करण ifthen why there should be the word Udyotakavaanaam unless is ङीप् is not governed by टच्? Consider the example of जातेरस्त्रीविषयादयौपधात् ४।१।६३

पुंयोगादाख्यायाम्॥ ४।१।४८॥ which govern the ङीष्, independent of समास or समासान्त, and नियतलिङ्ग-s. You have explain the पयोजन of टित् also, as in both cases, they do not warrant ङीप् and the prescription of टच् would be useless in any case, if you insist on पुंयोग which is not in this case. I can't follow or understand your argument.  

  

Thanks for your evaluation.
