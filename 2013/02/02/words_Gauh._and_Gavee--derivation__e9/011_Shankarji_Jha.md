Swasti, Thanks, my shining Big Brother, Prof. a. a., Please help me by getting a clarification on the Vyutpatti of the Sanskrit word 'Gavee' only (What is the Stem or Prakriti and what is the suffix Pratyaya in the word 'Gavee'?). Please leave the discussion on the Samasta Padas Udyotakara-gaveenaam or so. Best regard,
