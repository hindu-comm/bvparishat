As an addition, in Unicode, the Devanagari text composition is completely scientific, and characters are ordered the same way as their pronounced order. For example Unicode अङ्घ्रि has the hexadecimal representation 0905 0919 094D 0918 094D 0930 093F  
  
The characters standing for  
  
0905 अ  
0919 ङ  
094D ् (combining halant)  
0918 घ  
094D ् (combining halant)  
0930 र  
093F ि (combining maatra)  
  
The maatraa is on र and not on ङ or घ, which is how it is pronounced. One may refer <http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0900.pdf> for Unicode Devanagari chart and <http://rishida.net/tools/conversion/> for converting between Unicode and HTML/Hexadecimal.
