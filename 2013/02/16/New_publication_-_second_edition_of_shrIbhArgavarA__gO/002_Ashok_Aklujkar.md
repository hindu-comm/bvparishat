A general comment applicable beyond the present publication:  
  
Availability of cheap labour and profusion of skilled font-makers allowed the nineteenth-century publishers to come up with special fonts for almost all the ligatures that were seen in handwriting. In many instances, this also made the figuring out of the consonants involved in a ligature difficult for those who did not already know the language or the word involved. Indian scripts were the best technology in the age of handwriting, efficient through a judicious combination of alphabetic and syllabic writing. Unlike other ancient scripts such as the Greek and the Semitic, they represented the sounds accurately and unambiguously. As printing through typesetting was introduced, the scripts made a few compromises. With the coming of the computer age, we may need to make a few more compromises or compromises of a different sort. Therefore, there would be nothing wrong in using the viraama a bit more frequently if so doing we preserve the great ability of the scripts to reproduce speech accurately.  
  
  
Dear Shri Misra,  
  
I am delighted to get the good news that the extraordinary epic Śrībhārgavarāghavīyam of ;Srii-raama-bhadraacaarya is now available in electronic form.  
  
I have one suggestion to make regarding text composition. Words such as buddhi and a:nghri should not be printed as बुिद् ध and अिङ् घ्र The printing should be बुद्् धि and अङ् घ्रि, \*\* unless, of course, one can print the ligatures in the normal way with the preceding consonant shortened or placed in the upper part of the resultant sign.  
  
\*\*(Please ignore the spaces in between. The Devanagari-Qwerty keyboard I have to use here does not enable me to print the viraama/halanta sign without leaving a space after it vacant; maybe this is my ignorance about that keyboard),  
  
  
Reasons: The sound followed by the viraama sign, d or :n in the cases under discussion, is pronounced before the i-sign. The basic principle in Devanagari writing is that that which is pronounced first is written to the left, if it cannot be written with the following sign in such a way as to indicate its priority in pronunciation. Secondly, viraama indicates absence of a vowel. It is contradictory to have a viraama and a vowel like i in the same syllable.  
  
I am aware that the practice you have followed is now found in a number of Devanagari publications. It should be discouraged.  
  
I very much appreciate the contributions you make to the BVP forum.  
  
a.a.
