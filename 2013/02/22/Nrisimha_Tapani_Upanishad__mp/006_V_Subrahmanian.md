This Upanishad has been taken up for a detailed exposition by Sri Shankarananda Saraswati (Guru of Swami Vidyaranya) in a work titled 'AtmapurANam' which is also known as 'upaniShadratnam'.  
  
Also, Vidyaranya has devoted one chapter for this Upanishad in his 'anubhUtiprakAshaH' Chapter 20 titled: 'devavidyAprakAshaH' in 156 verses.  
  
There is also a commentary on this upanishad attributed to Sri Shankaracharya.
