I assume you will need both original and translations. You may try the publications of Bhuvan Vani Trust, Lucknow. Their catalogue is attached. The entire set of original text with Svara markings and Hindi translations following multiple Sanskrit commentaries in 17 volumes costs INR 8,000. Please see pages 7 and 12 of the attached file for details.  
  
The trust was started by the late Pandit Nanda Kumara Awashti, a close friend and neighbour of my late grandfather Pandit Srigopal Misra. It is still housed next to my ancestral home in Lucknow and is now run by Pandit Vinay Kumar Avashti, a polyglot and lexicographer. Their efforts to bring out major religious titles and many works of almost all major languages of India are unparalleled.
