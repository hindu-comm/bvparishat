Namaste  

I was searching for GuruChritra by Vasudevananda Sarasvati. It was written originally in Marathi.  

It was later translated by this sage into Sanskrit.

An e-book is shown as available in this site. (<http://guru-charitra.blogspot.in/>)  

  

Link for GuruChritra in Devanagari (Sanskrit) is given here,  

<http://guru-charitra.blogspot.in/search/label/Sri%20Guru%20Charitra%20Dwisahasri>  

  

-but it is deleted from that place.

This is GuruChritra in Kannada script on the same site.  

<http://guru-charitra.blogspot.in/2009/04/blog-post_18.html>

  

I do not know Kannada script.  

  

I wanted to know if the Unicode Kannada script in the site could be converted to Devanagari Sanskrit.  

Is it possible to convert any other language Unicode script into other, for eg. Telugu to Devanagari and vice-versa?  

  

Is GuruCharitra available as an e-book anywhere else? Please let me know.  

  

I request the Parishad scholars to please enlighten me in this regard.

  

Yours sincerely

Usha
