There is a tool called Bhasha IME (<https://sites.google.com/site/bhashaime/>) which converts from multiple scripts / conventions to multiple scripts / conventions. For those who do not know / like coding, this is quite useful.

  
The result is not suitable for printing straight away, but it is still very useful nonetheless. Most of the oddities can be fixed in a single parse of reading (hopefully one converts text and also reads it) and correcting. For best results, the correction may be done through the ''find and replace'' feature of a text editor.
