Google search for Samskrita words अङ्क, पञ्च, काण्ड, अन्त and सम्पूर्ण correctly transliterated as ಅಙ್ಕ, ಪಞ್ಚ, ಕಾಣ್ಡ, ಅನ್ತ, ಸಮ್ಪೂರ್ಣ et cetera do show results (several hundreds including some Kannada blogs), so I guess there are some bloggers/writers using the संयुक्तपञ्चम form. The renderings ಅಂಕ, ಪಂಚ, ಕಾಂಡ, ಅಂತ and ಸಂಪೂರ್ಣ show many more Google hits.  
  
I am not aware of the convention followed by publishers of Samskrita Vedic, Puranic or epic literature in Kannada script.
