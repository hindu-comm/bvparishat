Dear Shri Kaul,  
  
Even in the older works, such as the sUrya siddhAnta, we find verses describing the libration (although different from the modern theory of precession) of equinoxes, त्रिंशत्कृत्यो युगे भानां चक्रं प्राक् परिलम्बते। तद्गुणाद्भूदिनैर्भक्ताद् द्युगणाद्यदवाप्यते॥ तद्दोस्त्रिघ्ना दशाप्तांशा विज्ञेया अयनाभिधा:। तत्संस्कृताद् ग्रहात् क्रान्तिच्छायाचरदलादिकम्॥ (3.9-10), and the procedure for finding the अयनांश. And the astronomy texts describe the nirayana longitudes of planets. Besides, the fact that ancient astronomers also knew about the motion of the equinoxes is shown by their treating the nakshatra अश्विनी as the first, instead of कृत्तिका as in the vedas. This indicates they were well aware of the fact that the vernal equinox had shifted since even more ancient times.  
  
I do share your concern that with the precession of equinoxes and the resulting shifting of seasons, we will be observing festivals in the wrong seasons. Also, we have statements from the shruti (shatapatha brAhmaNa): वसन्तो वै ब्राह्मणस्यर्तुः, etc. The vasanta Ritu is important for brahmaNas (when agnyAdhAna is to be done), the griShma for KShatriyas, and the sharad for the Vaishyas. In olden days, a brahmANa who would perform a soma yAga every spring season was called a "prati vasanta somayAjin". But at the same time we should not forget that we have had thousands of years of tradition in observing the festivals on the basis of the prevailing luni-solar calendar, and there are strong arguments for following the same. This is indeed a complex issue to decide.  
  
Regards,  
  
Anand
