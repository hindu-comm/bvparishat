dear mishraji  
i understand your spirit and welcome the discussion as long as possible. but the language should be civilised in bvp. pl. dont use harsh words like crooked ect.  
i also urge both you and kaul to avoid bringing the matters from outside bvp. bvp messages should originate and end in bvp.
