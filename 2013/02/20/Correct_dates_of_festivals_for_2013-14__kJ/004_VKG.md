Pranam.

Before the issue degenerates into a slanging match, let me pose two questions for those professing for and against Sayana System. It is irrefutable fact, that time corrections are necessary taking into account, millennia of year are passing.

  

Drugganita and Surya Siddhanta are diverging on few issues. Hence many questions arise.

  

Regarding the Vedic Basis of Rashi, Graha and Vaara; I am yet to find such resource. I would like to be enlightened in that aspect. This concept could be a lateral addition.

  

However the old adage of Kalidasa -

पुराणमित्येव न साधु सर्वं .... needs to be taken into consideration here too.

  

सन्तः परीक्ष्य अन्यतरद भजन्ते।

  

Let us examine the issue thread bare, dispassionately to suggest our recommendations/ findings.

  

Vedas have references of Ritu, Nakshatra, Maasa. Puranas have references to Vaara, Graha and Rashi.

But, when does it start and end ... that has to be understood with the help of tradition only.

  

This is similar to a survey map by Government. The map shows that you have a stretch of land , with this contours. But to fix the boundaries, along the contours - we need the local people who could show you the reference point, from which we can measure the extent.
