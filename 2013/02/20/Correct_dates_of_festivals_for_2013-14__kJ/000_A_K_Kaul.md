Dear Shri Anand Hudliji,  
Jai Shri Ram!  
Thank you for your response.  
\<Currently, there are many debates among PanchAnga makers and religious institutions, including Maths and temples, such as the nirayana vs. sAyana debate, the sUrya siddhAnta vs. dRggaNita/AryabhaTIya debate, chAndramAna vs. sauramAna debate, etc.>  
Mesha, Vrisha etc. rashis are twelve equal divisions of an imaginary circle known as ecliptic!  
Since a chain is as strong as its weakest link, thus all these nirayana versus saayana controversies are based on imaginary presumptions have been created out of ignorance of the Vedic lore, which has not talked about any Mesha, Vrisha etc. rashis even by mistake!  
And wisely so, because these Mesha etc. rashis are not an indigenous product as we do not find them in any astronomical work either, prior to the Surya Siddhanta of Pancha-Siddhanitka, which could be a work of about second century AD/BCE at the earliest, even if the "king of demons" viz. Maya Mahaasura claims that it was revealed (sic!) to him by none other than Surya Bhagwaan Himself through His plenipotentiary, and that too a couple of million years back!  
Obviously, even that "demon" Maya Mahaasura is an imaginary author (demon!) who has created maximum problems for Indian astronomy by putting before the *dharma-paraayana* Hindu community some monstrous astronomical algorithms, which are neither tropical nor sidereal, neither geocentric nor heliocentric and so on!  
And ironically, even that imaginary demon, from whose shoulders these "Vedic astrologers" and "Vedic Panchanga-makers" are firing "*niraayana* guns" also has talked about nothing but the so called *saayana* rashis!
Want proofs? Here they are: He has cried from housetops in Maanadhyaya 9/10  
तयोर्र्मकर संक्रान्तेः षण्मासेषु उत्तरायणम कर्क्यादेस्तथैव स्यात् षण्मासाः दक्षिणायनं!  
द्वि राशि नाथाः ऋतवः षडुक्ताः शिशिरादयः मेषादयो द्वाद्दशैते मासैस्तैरेव वत्सरः  
The meaning is very clear even for a layman, "Six months of Uttarayana start from the day of Makar Samkraanti. Six months of Dakshinaayana start from the day of Karkata Samkraantih. Each season like Shishira etc. comprises two Raashislike Mesha etc.. Six seasons thus are formed by twelve Raashis and those very twelve raashis comprise a year"  
**Thus Makar Smakraanti is another name of the day of Uttarayana**!
**Karkata Samkraanti another name of the day of Dakshinaayana and so on**.  
As the year is supposed to have six seasons and twelve Rashis, the year of the Surya Siddhanta as well is thus seasonal, which "Vedic astrologers" call euphemistically as saayana!  
Even Aryabhatiya is unaware of any niraayana rashichakra, as Aryabhata, who was also around in sixth century AD, with Varahamihira, has said in 4/1:  
मेषादेः कन्यान्तं समं उदगप मन्डलार्धं अपयातं  
तौल्यादेः मीनान्तं शेषार्धं दक्षिणेनैव  
"One half of the ecliptic, running from the beginning of the sign Aries to the end of the sign Virgo, lies obliquely inclined to the equator Northwards. The remaining half of the ecliptic running from the beginning of the sign Libra to the end of the sign Pisces, lies equally inclined to the equator southwards"  
Thus Aryabhata has talked about *Uttara-gola* and *Dakshina-gola* starting from Mesha and Tula rashis respectively!  
And these are so called saayana phenomena!  
Same is the case with all the other siddhantas, including the Brahma-Sphuta Siddhanta or even Vateshwara Siddhanta of tenth century AD! (attachment Vateshwara)!  
I have clarified all these things in the attachments with my earlier post. No need to repeat them here!  
Regarding "chAndramAna", we must understand it once for all that lunar (synodic) months do not have an independent existence of their own but they are pegged to solar months in the Vedic or even Pauranic system of calendar-making!  
It is only in the Hejira calendar that synodic months are not pegged to any solar months, and that is why there are no *adhika* or *kshyaya* maasa etc. in that calendar. Similarly, if their Idul-Fitr was on say first of January in 2013, it will be on about first of February in 2016, on about first of March in 2019, on around first of April in 2022 and so on!  
But in the Vedic calendar, lunar Magha Shukla paksha always starts with the first New Moon after the solar Magha, and so on!  
Shukla Paksha remains the same whether it is *mukhya-maana* or *gauna maana!*  
And if we continue to follow Lahiri or Ramana or Chandra-Hair etc. etc. niraayana rashis galore for festivals also, the Hindu calendar will go the same way as the Hejira calendar, with the only difference that it will be so after a few centuries instead of a few months!  
For example, if Makar Samkraanti coincided with the shortest day of the year in 285 AD as per "almighty" Lahiri-walaas, it will coincide with the longest day of the year after about three thousand years (Pl. see Rashis and Jyotish paper wherein a thorough analysis of all such anachronisms has been done already!)  
\< For example, the Krishna JanmAShTami is accepted to be on the eighth day of the dark fortnight of shrAvaNa (or bhAdrapada in the north). However, some institutions observe it on the eighth day of the dark fortnight whenever the Sun is in Simha>  
By talking about Shri Krishna Janmashtam, you have touched one of the raw nerves!  
More than 12 years back, through my Shri Krishna Universal Ephemeris & Panchang, as will be clear from the attachment SKE-2, I had asked all the leading panchanga-makers as well as jyotishis and jagadgurus and even ISKCON people etc. etc. if they were really celebrating Janmashtami as per the Bhagavata or Vishnu Purana etc. by which they swear, since all those Puranas are talking about a so called saayana rasichakra!  
But I have yet to receive any response from anybody, including jagadgurus or ISKCON people!  
It is not only Janmashtami or Rama Navmi etc. that are being celebrated on wrong days, but the entire gamut of Hindu fasts, festivals and fairs and even muhurtas has been made to spin on its head by these so called niraayana/saayana inventions.  
This too will be clear from the paper Rashis & Jyotish as well as "Criteria for Festivals"that is already with the forum.

BTW, it is not only Puranas and Siddhantas that have talked about a so called Saayana Rashichakra, but even Tantra works like "*Tantra-aaloka*" by the master Yogi of tenth century of Kashmir were aware of nothing but a so called saayana rashichakra (attachments TA1 & TA2)  
\< It is not easy to achieve consensus among all the parties.>  
You are absolutely right! Vested interests always turn a blind eye to *dharma-shastra,* and that too in the name of *dharmashastra* itself.
This will be clear from the paper "ramanji"!  
\<Perhaps, the best option is to convince some leading institutions to accept a reformed calendar. \>  
I have been making efforts over the last thirty years "to convince some leading institutions to accept a reformed calendar". But because of those very vested interests, all types of abuses are being hurled on me and some "Vedic astrologers" are even claiming that some Christian missionaries are providing me funds to sabotage the Hindu *dharma*!  
In view of the above, I am sure you will take time out to go through all the papers and sift grain from the chaff so that we can reform the deformed Vedic calendar in a united manner!  
With regards and Jai Shri Ram!  
A K Kaul
