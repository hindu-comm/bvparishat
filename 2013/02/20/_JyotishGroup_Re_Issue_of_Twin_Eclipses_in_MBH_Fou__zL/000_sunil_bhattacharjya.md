Dear friends,  
  
As always Mr. Kaul is a confused man and he wants to confuse the gullible ones among us with his confusions. Different people may work in different ways. He completely forgets that there have been many scholars who worked on the date of Mahabharata war, without ever resorting to any astrology. Has he ever tried himself to work on the date of the Mahabharata war? If not he should try forthwith wihtout wasting any time. He has already wasted several decades and his confusions are still continuing. If he has tried and failed he should
be frank to admit that and open up by saying what are the problems he faced.  

  

Further the MBH war started with 11akshauhinis on the Kaurava side and 7 akshauhinis on the Pandava side and the count of men, animals and chariots were exactly not the same in all the akshauhinis. The definition of Akshauhini only gives the highest limit of men, animals and chariots in an akshauhini. Forgetting this common sensical point, people come out with fantastic figures of men, animals and chariots destroyed in that war.  
  
Regards,  
Sunil KB

Shri G S Sharmaji,

Jai Shri Ram!

Thank you for your mail, which has remained "dormant' in the drafts section of my Gmail for a long time due to anoversight!

Now an answer to yourquestions:

\<Can YOU specify a date on such an event. When do you think such an event happened. if you think, if at all it happened? . \>

a)Yes, there has been a Mahabhaarata war, when Bhagwaan Krishna was around, since nobody else could have recited the Gita except for Him!

For me He is the "*shodhasha-kalaa-sampoorna-avataar*".

b\) It would have been much easier to answer the question as to when Bhagwaan Krishna was around if "Vedic astrologers" had not muddied the pristine waters of Vedic culture by trying to erect His horoscopes!

This has created a lot of confusion since He is supposed to have been around at the fag end of Dwapara Yuga, when Kaliyuga was just going to start immediately after He ascended to Goloka. Since an imaginary date of start of Kaliyuga has been fixed as February 17/18, 3012 BCE, "Vedic astrologers" had to somehowmaneuveritin such a manner as "*saamp bhi mare aur laathi bhi na toote*" i.e. they had to account for Kaliyuga as well the *janmapatri* of Bhagwaan Krishna!

Thus the "Vedic astrologers" created innumerable hurdles by suggesting such dates as were exactly about a quarter and a century or so prior to Kaliyuga!

The entire issue got obfuscated thus since nobody knows actually as to when Kaliyuga started, if it has started at all!

As such, if we really want to find the date of Incarnation of Bhagwaan Krishna and/or the Mahabharata war, the first thing we will have to do is "get rid of Kaliyuga" from our psyche! It should be quite easy,  as the starting date of Kaliyuga is imaginary even otherwise also!

c\) It is not only the horoscope of Bhagwaan Krishna that is creating a lot of confusion but other astrological combinations in the Mahabharata regarding planets vis-a-vis nakshatras (sans Rashis!) and three consecutive eclipses where two of them were within fourteen days of one another etc., whichphenomenaare supposed to have repeated themselves again after exactly thirty-six years etc. are creating many problems.

d\) It was impossible to have calculated the exact dates---leave alone timings---of eclipses even in early centuries of the first millennium of CE, so it is next to impossible that any eclipses could have been calculated before hand in India prior to that time!

e\) Thus if there is mention of eclipses in the Mahabharata, they must have really taken place and must have been visible in Kurukshetra and/or nearby areas.  Or this astrological jargon could be an interpolation of a much later date as well!

However, quite a few scholars have made honest efforts to try to find such dates of eclipses etc. and all of them have come up with different dates, one differing from the other by several centuries!

f\) It means that all those dates cannot be correct though all those dates may be wrong!

g\) In a nutshell, we cannot find the actual date of the Mahabharata war however hard we try to solve the problem on the basis of astrological jargon in the Mbh!

  

\<Personally, I think it might be much easier to look at archaeological data (below the ground than up in the sky) to find such mega events. \>

I fully agree with you on that point!

\<You are aware of the number of "akshaunees" of soldiers that participated in that war and perished too.>

There are quite a fewhyperbolein the epics, so it is not necessary that millions upon millions would have died in that war, but certainly at least thousands ofwarriorsmust have lost their lives then.

\<I am sure human race could have found the grave yards / remnants (even if burned away) of thousands of warriors, elephants, horses, chariots and other artifacts from such an event even if it may have occurred thousands of years back. It would be easy to get a carbon dating on such artifacts. Since we already know the place "Kurukshetra" , it would be easy too.>

That reminds me of a poem during school days---I forget the name---in which it was said that a school going boy (of some foreign country) had come across some skull which he was playing with like a football. His grandfather admonished him and advised him to treat those skulls with respect since those were the limbs of warriors who had lost their lives while fighting for their mother land. 

Personally, I have not heard of any such happenings in Kurukshetra, but maybe that is because the corpses there were cremated instead of buried.

Yes, it would be easier to find the dates of such events by carbon dating etc. of the remnants but then, that certainly is not my field.

And I think there has been some work by quite a few archaeologists, but their efforts appear to have got bogged down because of the clamour from  
Vedic astrologers" to only trace such relics as could be dated prior to 3102 BCE!

\<Why don't we try to pool our resources to do something that is really scientific instead of this kind of refuting & criss-cross batting?>

I fully agree with you, and am circulating this letter to several forums so as to see how many agree with such a proposal.

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!

Shri Lalit Mishraji,

Jai Shri Ram!

I have been aware of the views of Dr. S. Balakrishna that the Mahabharata war could have taken place in 3129 BCE etc. as "Six pairs of eclipses visible at*Kurukshethra*occurring in less than or near 14 days" are supposed to have taken place in those years.

I had checked 3129 BCE as a serious contender since it was before 3102 BCE,

The attachment "3129-BCE-eclipses" makes it clear that though there was a solar eclipse on August 11 of that year, "but not visible from this location" i.e. it was not visible from Kurukshetra.

Similarly, the lunar eclipse of August 26, 3129 BCE too could not be visible from Kurukshetra for several reasons, and I leave it to "scholars extraordinary" like you to judge the reason behind the same!

**Thus neither of these two "serious contenders" was visible at all from Kurukshetra, as claimed by Dr. S. Balakrishna! It means that the Mahabharata war did not take place in that year!**

Regarding the possibility that the Mahabharata war could have taken place in "b) 2559 BC c) 2056 BC d) 1853 BC e) 1708 BC and 1397 BC." as claimed by Dr. S. Balakrishna, **I can check the details whether the "pairs of eclipses" which are supposed to have taken place in those years were visible from Kurukshetra or not, only and only if people like you agree that the Kaliyuga that is supposed to have started in 3102 BCE could have started in any other year after that, or maybe it has not started at all, even till today!**

**Since if the Kaliyuga is supposed to have started in 3102 BCE, the Mahabharata war could not have taken place later than that! After all, Kaliyuga could not withstand the presence of Bhagwaan Krishna!**

You cannot have the cake and eat it as well! 

Jai Shri Ram!

A K Kaul
