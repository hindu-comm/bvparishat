 The problem of Samskritam is not at the level of PhD. The problem is at the BA Level itself.  

 The demographics of the students who study samskritam has changed quite a bit - many are  

 from rural backgrounds and do not have access to all the books and training.  
  

 A few weeks ago, I had the chance to observe some samskritam students - it was bad to  
 see them using decades old badly printed original sources.  
  
There are no proper modern Samskritam Textbooks at all at the BA/MA Level - so  
 how in the world can they bring out quality PhD's ?  
 They dont have proper modern textbooks that give the full background and fundamentals of any subject.  

 Many so called textbooks are reprints of books from 1950's or even earlier. No Samskritam  

 scholar has thought that its important to have modern textbooks, workbooks etc.  
  

 Look at this Univ Of Delhi link - it should give an idea....  

 <http://ms.du.ac.in/BA_hons_sanskrit.pdf>  

  

 There is no training of teachers - so the quality of teachers is very patchy.  

 There is a great reliance on hand-me-down notes.  
  

 So every obstacle is put in front of the student -  

 - No Good Textbook  

 - No Trained Teacher (the irony is that educational institutions dont train!)  

 - Teacher teaches in a language other than Samskritam  
 using notes-handed down for decades.  
  
 Please take a look at the catalog of Rashtriya Samskritam Sansthan ( the premier  

 samskritam institution) - and see how many old reprints they have. They dont think  

  that its important to have good well printed books- let alone good textbooks.  

  
 Forget modern textbooks in areas like nyaya/arthashastra etc  
 - There is not even a modern well printed Ramayanam - with explanations in simple samskritam.  

  

 In other areas of study (like engineering) , Indian textbooks are copies of Western textbooks.  

 so one can find good textbooks for all levels.  

  
 But to develop Samskritam textbooks - there is no one to copy from !!  
  Because the bulk of the existing set of teachers have had their education in 1970's/80's  

 they persist with what they know. They are from the pre-liberalization India.  
  

 The current generation of students have to be given the right tools for learning - what worked  

 for 1970's may not be right for 2013  

  
 Sure - three will always be some very good students ...  

  but, unless there are good modern textbooks in Samskritam  
 unless the teachers are given training  
 and the teaching is in Samskritam..  
 ...there is no way that the 'standards' can go up.  

  

 The students I got to observe a few weeks ago - probably do not even realize how they  

 are being shortchanged - by their professors.
