Subject: Giving names to cows.  
To:  
  
  

It is well known that cows respond very positively to affectionate handlin and love. For this every cow should be given a name and called by that name.

In a house hold with a few cows this is not difficult. But in Goshala with hundreds of cows, it is a problem to find a glossary of names.

I am taking the opportunity to send attached here with the Gosahasranamstrotra गोसह्स्रनामस्त्रोत्र. I hope cow lovers will find it of great

interest.
