Dr. Hudli!



The current version of traditional learning in Taittiriya shakha is called ‘Sarasvata patha’.

Here, mantra, brahmana and anubrahmana portions are jumbled up.



Bodhayana, in his Srauta Sutra, has enumerated the topical arrangement of the entire shakha into 53 vishayas and divided into prajapatya, agneya, soumya and vaisva-deva kandas.

These are seen by kanda-rishis and besides, svayambhuva kanda containing svadhyaya brahmana and Upanishads as samhiti, yajniki and varuni; Indra as sadasaspati are the seers for

These portions.

The nava-kandarsishi tarpanam and vrata upakrama/utsarjana during samavartana are based on this division, called ‘arsheya krama’.



Though not in vogue, I have been taught and have tried to highlight in my website for knowledge sake. I’ve also given their ‘*inter se*’ mapping.



The present parayanam practice on Ekadasi is based on the prevalent/popular notion of Taittiriya Brahmana ashtaka 3 prasnas 8 and 9 designated as Asvamedha.

In fact, all the portions listed by Bodhayana qualify to be recited as Asvamedha on Ekadasi.
