Dear Dr. Ramanujan,  
  
Thanks for your reply and pointing out a useful webiste. The mantras are indeed listed under the ashvamedha viShaya. Searching on jImUtasyeva, it is also listed under ashvamedha brAhmaNa.  
  
So, if these mantras are related to the ashvamedha, is there a tradition among current day yajurvedins to recite these mantras during एकादशी
days? I am not sure if the ashvamedha mantras themselves have to be recited or ashvamedha brAhmaNa portion only. I have heard that yajurvedins are supposed to do the pArAyaNa of ashvamedha mantras during एकादशी, as the Rg vedins are supposed to recite the pavamAna sUkta.  
  
Anand
