Dear Prof. Achar,

Jai Shri Ram!

You will recall that you were kind enough to send me, several years back, a hard copy of your papers “Date of the Mahabharata War” that had appeared in the Journal of Mythic Society of January-June 2003.

I have been poring over those papers a lot and would like to make a few observations as follows:

1. On page 70 of the above papers you have made a categorical statement, “These constitute the basic set of astronomical facts:Before the war broke out there was new moon at Jyeshtha.**There was a lunar eclipse on the Kartika full moon, followed by a solar eclipse.There were two eclipses separated by only thirteen days**…. Karna described the then existing planetarypositions during a lengthy conversation with Krishna before the war broke out……. Any work which professes to determine the date of the war on the basis of astronomy, must account for these events. If the events as projected in a given work fall outside of the framework of this time interval, the date proposed by that work could be rejected….”.

What is to be noted here is that "Karna described the then existing planetary positions", **and not that of comets**!

Let us, therefore, see as to how far these astronomical parameters are accounted for in your paper on the same criteria, as advocated by you yourself.

2.You have said on page 80 of the above papers, “…There was such a situation before the war. The simulations show that **the lunar eclipse on September 29 (3067 BCE) was followed by an annular solar eclipse at Jyeshtha on October 14. There occurred a third lunar eclipse, a penumbral one, on the following full moon on October 28.** **The last one occurred within an interval of less than fourteen days after the solar eclipse in Jyeshtha.”**

3. You have also said on page 83, “In the present work, therefore, it is considered sufficient if the eclipse occurred and not much weight was given to the exact location of visibility".

4.Thus you had/have absolutely no doubt that there were three eclipses between September 29 and October 28, 3067 BCE, where the "last one was within an interval of less than fourteen days" all of which were supposed to be visible at least in some part of India if not Kurukshetra itself! 

You have confirmed these very views further in the following words on page 82, “A further confirmation of this fact arises, for thirty-six years later, Krishna sees the signs of destruction of the Yadavas….The simulations have confirmed that according to the sky diary in the year 3031 BCE, **there was also an eclipse season with three eclipses**. **A penumbral lunar eclipse on October 20 (3031 BCE) was followed by an annular solar eclipse on November 5. This was followed by another penumbral lunar eclipse on November 19, within an interval of less than fourteen days,** exactly as described in the epic”!

5.The problem with these statements is that as per the attachment “3067BCE-eclipses”, none of the lunar eclipses referred to by you either in 3031 BCE or 3067 BCE was visible anywhere in the whole world---**even including *Patalaloka*,** if I may so----for the simple reason that those lunar eclipses were penumbral and their magnitudes were as follows: (i) Lunar eclipse of October 21, 3031 BCE (TDT)= .15; (ii) Lunar eclipse of November 20, 3031 BCE = .29 (iii) Lunar eclipse of September 29, 3067 BCE = .14; (iv) Lunar eclipse of October 29, 3067 BCE = .29.

6.And as you would be aware, a penumbral lunar eclipse with a magnitude of less than .6 is not visible at all even from any part of the area where it may be visible otherwise because of Delta time factor etc.!

7.Thus if there was no lunar eclipse visible in 3031 BCE or in 3067 BCE in any part of the world during the periods referred to by you, and the possibility of the solar eclipse of 3067 BCE being visible from Kurukshetra also completely ruled out, it amounts to saying that though the Veda-Vyasa cried from housetops that there were or were going to be devastating eclipses one after the other in that year (3067 BCE) the Mahabharata-kar, whether “Vyas” or “Ganesha” (actually the interpolators!) had gone honkers and had been hallucinating about such eclipses as never took place actually in any part of the globe as they were not visible at all!

8.It certainly gives a very wrong impression of the entire knowledge of Vyasa and Ganesha and gives us a feeling that even they were hallucinating about certain phenomena like some of our modern "Vedic astronomers"

9\. What is more ironic than anything else is that it was not only during the months of September-October that no lunar eclipse was visible in the whole world in 3067 BCE but it was actually during the entire year of the presumed Mahabharata war that no lunar eclipse could be visible, since none of those eclipses had magnitudes more than.3.

10. If the authors of the Mahabharata like “Ganesha” or “Vedavyasa” could have goofed up about such important astronomical phenomena as eclipses, it is not difficult to imagine as to what the percentage of goofing would have been about their other statements like, “Managal was retrograde in Magha, Brihaspati was in Shravana…and so on”and that is exactly what you have confirmed----that they goofed!---when you say, on page78, “It appears that the list of astronomical entities refers not to planets but to comets….Thus***shashi, bhaskara, surya-putra*in these shlokas refer to comets”! 

11.What you are actually doling is just finding an easy way out, on the shoulders of S. Raghavan, and superimposing your interpretations on them and trying to prove thatthat whether it was Veda-Vyasa or Ganesha,they had absolutely no knowledge of differentiating between a planet and a comet and would confuse one with the other in spite of their omniscience! 

And you are taking the help of Varahamihira’s Brihat Samhita for giving some credibility to your such statements!

Varahamihira was around in sixth century AD, more than 3500 years after your date of Mahabharata!Don't you think it is a highly far-fetched statement, to say the least!

12.Regarding the accuracy or otherwise of the software that you have used for your work, the less said the better, since on page 112 of your paper, you have indicated middle of (penumbral lunar) eclipse on November 19, 3031 BCE at 1:19 local time but have given the timing of Full Moon at 6-31 local time on the same date! This gives a difference of more than five hours between the Full Moon and the middle of lunar eclipse! 

13.Even a tyro in astronomy should know that the time gap between a geocentric Full Moon and the middle of lunar eclipse,because of parallax corrections of the moon and the sun,cannot be more than about two hours at the most, I repeat two hours at the most, plus or minus, even in extreme cases, which are extremely rare!

14.I do not know how an astrophysicist like you overlooked such a lacuna in the tools that you were working with and trying to prove to the whole world the accuracy of the dates of the Mahabharata war as advocated by S. Raghavan on the basis of that very software! 

15.The best way, therefore, to give due respect to our Rishis is not to try to decipher as to what they had said about astrological portents and about Janma-kundalis etc. whether of Bhagwaan Rama or the Mahabharata war etc., since we have absolutely no means of sifting interpolated material from the actual statements of those rishis, and maybe that is why we are confusing the hogwash of later interpolators as the “*brahma-vaakya*” of Krishna Dwaipayana Vedavyasa or Valmiki Rishis or even Ganesha!                            
                                   
                                   
                                   
         IMHO, we must, therefore, stop all such efforts of making a laughing stock of ourselves in the eyes of the whole world by dint of such ludicrous deciphering of astrological anracadabra in the epics and/or Puranas etc.!!

*Shubhasya sheeeghram!*

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!

PS

Something about the programe which has generated the details of eclipses in the attachment:

I) Solar polynomials etc. have been taken from Planetary Programs and Tables from -4000 to +2800, by Bertagnon and Simon (Willmann-Bell, 1986).

II) Lunar algorithms are based on "Lunar Tables and Programs from 4000 BC to AD 8000" by Chapront Touze and Chapront (Willmann-Bell, 1991) with corrections from "Astronomical Algorithms" by Meeus (Willman-Bell, 1998).

The results generated compare quite favourably with those of Swiss Ephemeris or VSOP87 or even with Solex for periods up to 4000 BCE, the inbuilt difference being at the most about ten minuets plus or minus in extreme cases for New/Full Moon or Eclipse timings vis-a-vis TDT.

III\) Delta Time corrections are from Morrison, 2004, and are hardly plus/minus a couple of seconds from that of Swiss Ephemeris.
