Sir,  
  
Namaste. I went through the attachment. Really it is a laudable effort for innovative teaching for Vedanta. You have utilized your scholarship and experience in NLP to think differently. As you said, this effort can be extended to any other *शास्त्रम् ।* Also, the methodology you adopted in teaching the basics of Vyakarana in mother tongue is suffice to make one confident in (basic) Sanskrit. Each *शास्त्रम्* has its own jargon. You may please share of the technique, that has adopted by your six students in realizing the meaning of Vedanta jargon.  
  
Regards,  
Prasad
