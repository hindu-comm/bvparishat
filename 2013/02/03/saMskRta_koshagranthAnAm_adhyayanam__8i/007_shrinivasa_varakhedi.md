Dear Scholars,

  

Policy makers of Sanskrit Institutions should note that research in Sanskrit is diminishing as there is no much scope for innovations. We must open the research field to the researchers from other disciplines. They will do wonders. I have interacted with some scholars who did well in Sanskrit with the background of Mathematics and modern science. We should encourage such cross-cultural and interdisciplinary research. We need to give them some extra courses.

  

In TIFR Mumbai person with any PG can get admission into PhD course by clearing entrance test. If science is open to humanities students, why not the humanities for science students?

  

We need to change our mindsets. For debate.

  

warm regards,
