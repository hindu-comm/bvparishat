Dear Dr. Varakhedi,  
Namaskarah. As far as the past and current Classical Sanskrit Literature is imagined, 60% of are in verse 40% of are in prose. In prose literature too, it is not necessarily being available in the prose order format and active and passive verbs, nouns having compound forms are jumbled up. Imagine a few students pass through the 10th, Inter, Graduation and PG, then thinking about the MPhil-s and the Ph.D-s registrations. How much of the analyzing capacity they earn when they have a few verses/prose texts of a scientific nature? How much opportunity they get through the span of this limited course period to analyze a few verses of Valmiki's Ramayana, the Mahabharata or any Kalidasa's Kavyas without the help of any regional dialect translations? And Sanskrit learning is not required to understand that who were Rama and Sita, Bhishma and Sakuni, Aja and Dasharatha and so on. We have translations and translations, exam guides and gozzippings in regional dialects!!!!  
In my humble opinion the Kavyavyutpatti is a must for any PG qualifier in Sanskrit before one getting indulged into MPhil-s and the Ph.D-s. Sincerely speaking, if such students fail to analyze any verse or passage, we do not have the right to ask them why do you fail to do so. Why then? Because we do not have the mechanism in our syllabi or we are not been able apply the system due to syllabi where the printed certificates are aimed for further official procedures (UGC-10% weightage for M.Phil and 20% for Ph.D for an Assistant Professors post).  
We compare the same ste up with the 10th, Inter, Graduation and PG, then thinking about the MPhil-s and the Ph.D-s registrations of Mathematics and Modern Science. They have the mechanism of all required fundamentals are being taught to have further investigation in their field. In all these cases it is not the lack of intelligence or work interest that students have. In one case, you have no scope to improve to improve your required fundamentals due to your syllabi, and in the other case the syllabi must be grown own their fundamentals and students must be capable of handling their algoriths.  
It is not the question of whether the science is open to humanities or the humanities for science, but the fundamentals of Sanskrit one holds whether one is having the Sanskrit Certificates or the Modern Science Certificates. Let one learn Sanskrit fundamentals to have the Kavyavyutpatti rather than or even if having certificates irrespective of humanities and science. There should be an environment like that. Like the Spoken-Sanskrit courses popular it is the high time for the free fundamental training in Kavyas, in various Sastra Texts etc. without providing any printed certificates or syllabi, because there is no end to our syllabi, you live and learn, that's all. Then only the effort of Sanskrit learning will give fruit. Let the Universities think about such skill workshops, which may lead to the progress in learning various Sastras through constant efforts of teachers and students. By that way even Ph.D holders in Sanskrit too can use and understand good Sanskrit and enjoy the manuscripts of various Shastras, whether they belong to any discipline of Sanskrit Courses or Modern Science. All thoses certificates have become the office tools effectively. So, be change of mindset for Sanskrit learning despite of the certificates having held too.  
In my humble opinion: Why do we take pain (or to enjoy in taking pain-श्रमसाध्या विद्या) to learn Sanskrit fundamentals? Because of that we are being the Indians, if we let it loose, no others will take care of Sanskrit.  
Regards,  
Narayanan
