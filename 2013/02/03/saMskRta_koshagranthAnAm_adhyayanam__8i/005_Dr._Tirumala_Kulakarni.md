As per my experience students from Gurukula System prefer editing unpublished work for their Ph.D. degree. The problems faced are -

  

1\. Lack of manuscript which are suitable for Ph.D. work. Though there are manuscripts of 50 to 100 pages, the number of manuscripts above 300 pages are next to nil.

  

2\. The recently revised rules say that students should take manuscripts of that subject in which they have MA.

  

Combination of these two is causing decrease of number of editing the unpublished works.

  

Re: \`Instead of writing on the same subjects again and again for their Ph.Ds,'

  

There is a need to create a list of interesting and important titles for each shastras for future Ph.D. students.
