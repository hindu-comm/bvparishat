hariH OM,  
  
<http://kailasaashram.com/>  

 Above is the link of kailAsAshrama R^iShikesh. They have published authentic versions of the sha\~Nkara bhAShyas on upaniShads along with
Tiikaas (Anandagiri etc.). The Tiikaa and bhAShya have been given TippaNi by svaamii shrii viShNudevAnanda giri. The TippaNis are extremely useful in understanding difficult portions of the bhAShya.  
  

 Just like the Mahesh Research Institute of Varanasi, the kailAsAshrama books are free from printing errors and it is difficult to find an error even in tens of pages. Moreover, the books are very reasonably priced.  
  

 Procuring books from the Ashrama is very easy because of the very helpful people at the Ashrama. I had procured two complete sets and the people were extremely kind in helping me. I am extremely grateful to the Ashrama and its people for their contribution to the tradition of error-free, high-quality publishing in Sanskrit.  
  

svasti,  

 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,  


shrivathsa.
