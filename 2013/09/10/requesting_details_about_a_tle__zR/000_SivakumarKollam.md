SAdara praNAm,  

Recently came across a ninety year old Tamil title  

"VAsudevamananam" ( VivekasAram).  

In the introduction it is stated that VAsudeva Yatheendra  

wrote 40 Sanskrit verses and later translated into Tamil.  

and added a prose version also as commentary.  

Anyone who has studied the work or know about it  
may please be kind enough to provide  

details about the author and the original  

Sanskrit version which is not included  
in the Tamil title that I am having..  

NamaskAr.  

*sivakumarr*
