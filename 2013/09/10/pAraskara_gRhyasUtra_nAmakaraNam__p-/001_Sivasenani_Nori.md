In the Paspasahnika, while discussingthe prayojana of studying Vyakarana, under the heading "दशम्यां पुत्रस्य" we find this sentence: याज्ञिकाः पठन्ति - "दशम्युत्तरकालं पुत्रस्य जातस्य नाम विदध्याद्घोषवदाद्यनतरन्तःस्थमवृद्धं त्रिपुरुषानूकमनरिप्रतिष्ठितम्। तद्धि प्रतिष्ठिततमं भवति। द्व्यक्षरंचतुरक्षरं वा नाम कृतं कुर्यान्न तद्धितम्" इति। Commentators say that this istaken from Grihya-sutras. This is evenmore restrictive than the above.



Even without these restrictions, i.e. including names like Rama and Narayana which start with a vriddhi letter, the most comprehensive list of Hindu names has about 20,000 names.(Maneka Gandhi's "The Book of Hindu Names" had the longest list of names ten years back, when yours truly tried to get a list). This is less than the population of many towns in India, not to mention districts or States. In fact it is not even sufficient to name all the villages in the country, which exceed 6 lakh (Census 2011). Thus the problem is that we have about20,000 names to uniquely identify nearly 1 crore people. Even if we take that Maneka Gandhi's book is not comprehensive, the essential nature of the problem remains. For instance, there are less than 2 lakh entries in the dictionary by Monier Williams. On this basis, if we take 2 lakh to be the names available, it is nowhere sufficient to name 1 crore people.



One way of overcoming this is to attacha second name - that of the father, village, family or such. When even such a viseshana does not do the job fully, a third reference is brought. Example: Maharashtrians include both the father's name and the family name. The same effect is achieved in legal matters (where proper identification of a person is essential) by insisting on name and father's name. In places like Punjab (and Rajasthan?), revenue records have both father's name and grandfather's name to uniquely identify the person.



By attaching two names, we get 20,000 x 20,000 = 40,00,00,000, i.e. 40 crore unique labels; by attaching a third name to a person, we get 40 crore x 20,000 = 8,00,000 crore, i.e. 8 lakh crore unique labels.



Another way is to use samastapadas for names. In A.P., this is much preferred as only the family name is usually attached to a given name.This is thebeauty of language that with 50 varnas, we can name an infinite number ofobjects, वाङ्मयस्य विचित्रता अनन्ता, as pointed out by Mahakavi Magha:



वर्णैः कतिपयैरेव ग्रथितस्य स्वरैरिव ।

अनन्ता वाङ्मयस्याहो गेयस्येव विचित्रता।। २.७२।।
