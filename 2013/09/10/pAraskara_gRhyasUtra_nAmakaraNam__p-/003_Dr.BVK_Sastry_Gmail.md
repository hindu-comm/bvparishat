Namaste



So what is in a name ? How to look at the name - data which runs as
\<8 lakh crore unique labels. \> in a community and use it for banking, election and identity purposes? ?



How is the name to be decided ? Don’t I have the freedom to have my own choice name? Can I not call my pet dog by what ever lovely name I want to call ? Why should a gruhya sutra’ decide what should be my social name ? Why then did Patanjali deliberate on shabda vikruti’s of
‘GauH’ as goNI, gotA , gAvI..?





1. A double fault in interpreting the texts of tradition creates a challenging scenario in understanding the intention of original text. What to speak if there are multiple faults ?

When the rule - guidance for name giving in a ‘Samskara’ is ported to
the point of naming for a social convention (vyavahara)



2. Let us explore the key issues in giving a ‘name’ as:

(a) ‘ rite of passage’ (SamskAra) (b) as a ‘ social convention’ (vyavahAra) and (c ) as a ‘mantra –deeksha - nAma’ ( for a yajna/ vidhi / upasanaa / ashrama grahana ). Each approach has a set of rules for naming appropriately. The vyakti-nAma (person name) rules are not same as sthala-nAma (place names) . Why mix up the rule books and look for compliance ?



3. In the above segment of entities expecting a ‘ name which is supposed to be compliant with the gruhya sutra’, where does the Paraskara Guhya Sutra apply ? Can we have a clarity on this technicality ? And if so, how many of the world population – living entities – places –items – get included or excluded from this criterion ? How does one decide the ‘ linga = gender’ of the target entity ? 



Is there a historic compliance trail even within the ‘ most traditional sampradaya aligned families’ for having followed this guidance ?



And any ‘prayaschitta’ if there is a violation ? ( like sagotra vivaha) ? Of late TV Channels are populated with ‘ Luck-harbinger advisors’ who recommend change of the mobile numbers and given names over a phone call , using tarot cards ? ! What sampradaya is this ?





4. When we miss (a) the ‘ ShAstra-SampradAya - Vedangataa’ approach in studying ‘Vyakarana and Gruhya Sutras’ and (b) substitute the social language model in analyzing the ‘ Samskruhtam = language of Yoga’, the double fault foundation has already set in .



Consequence is more and more confusion in the name of ‘Shaastra –Sampradaya compliance’.
