Yes this is the verse I was alluding to.Vijñānabhikṣu has quoted this verse twice in the Vijñānāmṛtabhāṣya on Brahmasūtra. Prabhupāda has also quoted this at several places (including in the introduction to his commentary on Bhagavatam), with a slight variation as folows -

  

māyāvādamasacchāstraṁ pracchannaṁ bauddhamucyate

mayaiva kalpitaṁ devi kalau brāhmaṇamūrtinā

  

Although the use of term Māyāvāda in the Gaudiya Vaishnava tradition is not new. One quote onMāyāvāda is evenascribed to Caitanya Mahāprabhuin the Caitanyacaritāmṛtam (Madhyalīlā 6.169) by Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja.

  

The termMāyāvāda was also used by Bhāskara's in his commentary onBrahmasūtra.For more on the term and its use by various commentators, one may refer
