Let me try to answer this question. Advaitns don't accept Mayavada. They don't call their theory as Mayavada. When the don't call their theory as Mayvada there is no question of a founder. As said by scholars the term is often used in a pejorative sense . One can find several stray references to it in purnas and several vedantic texts which don't accept Advaita Vedantas view. Now all references to so called Mayvadins theory or mayavadins view can be collected if one desires and then find out its context and relevance which can be an area of research. Scholars may point to such researches if they are made already. I hope by this i am able to get a sense out of this thread. I might be wrong here in my understanding about what this thread means.
