Sri Nityanand Misraji,



1.My post

"I am sure that there must be email groups where references with negative comments are provided in response to a seeker of information on a certain vāda "

was not intended to be, nor in the nature of moderation.



It was just in response to thefollowing wordsof Sri Hari Parshad Dasji

"I am sure that there must be email groups where Nyayamrita vs. Advaita Siddhi are being discussed. I feel that the discussion as to whether these verses refer to any specific personality or not is better suited in that forum".



I think Sri Hari Parshadji did not intend to moderate through that statement either.



2\. The query in the initiating thread was not seeking to know the source of a certain statement on mAyAvAda.



It was,



"

What is mAyAvAda?

who is its founder?

How to know it?

Are there any specifications on mAyAvAda?

Is there any relation between mAyAvAda and Mayan civilization??"



Sri Hari Parshad Dasji's response did not attend to any of the questions. The responsewould have been appropriate to an enquiry such as "What is the source of the statement 'मायावादमसच्छास्त्रम्' "



I do not think you cited the references listed by you in response to an enquiry of this kind.



3\. There was a thread on certain Puranas calling certain Shastras tAmasik. No response in that thread was called inappropriate. The topic of the thread itself was on Puranas calling certain Shastras tAmasik.



4\. I answered the questions of the thread initiator in my own way within my knowledge.





Regards,



Nagaraj
