There is not an iota of doubt that the Bhagavata purana was the last of the Mahapurana. However most of the scholars ignore the fact that there is set of criteia called "panchalakshana", which makes it mandatory
that the Puranas be kept uipdated in certain aspects. Anybody reading the puranas have to keep this in mind.  
  

As regards the Bauddha also one has to keep in mind that word Buddha means a Jnani and particularly a Sankhya Jnani. In The Kapila-Asurui samvada it is given that the Sankhya-Jnani is Buddha. Even the Buddhists believe that there were a number of Buddhas before Lord Buddha and some of them appears to be mythological, though Lord Buddha was historical figure belonging to the Suryavamsha. The Puranas have given the genealogical list of the kings from the time of Lord Ram to the time of Lord Buddha and beyond.
