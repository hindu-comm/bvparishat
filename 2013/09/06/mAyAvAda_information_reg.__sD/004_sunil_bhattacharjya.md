Namaste,  
  

The Padmapurana says as follows:  

  
mayavadam asac-chastram  
pracchannam bauddham ucyate  
mayaiva vihitam devi  
kalau Brahmana-murtina (Padma Purana, Uttara-khanda 62.31)  
  

In Veda it is said that "Sat" came from "Asat", which means the "Sat" or the physical existence or creation came form "Asat", which is beyond existence. Mayavada teaches that the Lord has created the universe with his "Maya" and the Svetasvatara Upanishad says the "Maya is the "Prakrti". A liberated person realizes his or her oneness with The Brahman and for the liberated there is no more any separate physical existence for him, ie Maya or Prakrti does not exist for him or her.  
  

On the other hand there is no liberation for the Vaishnavas as the Bhagavatam (3.29.13) clearly states that the pure devotees do not want to get liberated at the cost of service to the Lord and therefore they do not accept any type of liberation.
