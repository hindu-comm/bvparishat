Dear Ajitji,



1\. Your moderation was timely.



2\. I answered the questions of the thread initiator in one of the very early posts of this thread itself. There I answered these two questions also there.



3\. māyā is certainly one of the most important key conceptsof Advaita Vedanta. Hence if someone uses the word māyāvāda as a name of the Advaita Vedamta, there should be no objection to it.



4\. That is why I answered the questions with the approach of māyāvāda =advaita vēdāṁta .



5.I also made the questioner aware of the fact that the word māyāvāda in a pejorative sense by the polemicalrivals.



6\. Some Puranas might reflect the position of such polemical rivals just as you said :



"One can find several stray references to it in purnas and several vedantic texts which don't accept Advaita Vedantas view"



Thanks,



Nagaraj
