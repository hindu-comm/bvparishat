Namaskaaram  
  
Maya is a Mesoamerican civilization noted for the only fully developed written languages as well as for its arts, architecture, mathematical and astronomical systems (2000BC - 250AD). They were deeply religious and worshiped various gods, the Sun,Moon,Fire,Rain etc., There is vast literature available on Maya civilization and a lot more research is going on. I personally feel that Mayan culture is very close to our Vedic culture.  
  
The term "Maya" occurs 70 times in Rigveda and 27 times in Adharvaveda. BhagavadGita also dealt with Maya.  
'Yantraruudhaanimaayayaa"(18/65), 'Maayayaahyaphrutagnaana'(7/14), 'Maayaametaamtarantite' (7/15). Sankarabhagavadpada also wrote 'Maayaapanchakam' . Shri Kumud Prasad can have abundant literature available from internet.
