It is a well-known fact that the term *māyāvāda* has historically been (and continues to be) mostly used in a pejorative and derogatory sense – the term may even be offensive to some. A questioner, who seemingly is not aware of this fact, needs to be made aware of the same. Hence, IMHO,the references to origins of the term and its historical use are helpful in a response. As the historical use has been mostly in critical contexts, critical references (e.g. its use in Padmapurāṇa or by Bhāskara) would naturally outnumber favourable or self-descriptive references (e.g. its use by Vācaspati Miśra in Bhāmatī).



Here is a very neutral extract (underline emphasis is mine) from Nakamura, Hajime (1990). *A History of Early Vedānta Philosophy (Translation by Trevor Leggett)*. Motilal Banarsidass. ISBN 9788120806511. pp. 120-122 –



Occasionally the term *advayavādin* also is used. This "non-dualistic monism" or its exponents can also be called *māyā-vāda* or *māyā-vādin*. *The most ancient use of this example known at present exists in the Padmapurāṇa*; occasionally the exponents were called “Māyā-Vedāntins,” and *Bhāskara, in rejecting the Śaṅkara theory, called it *māyā-vāda* in his Brahma-Sūtra-bhāṣya, but Śaṅkara himself never called his theory *māyā-vāda*, and, moreover, none of the thinkers prior to him had ever proclaimed it as their own theory.* *Māyā-vāda* may be said to be the idea that only the Brahman is real, and that everything else is completely phantasmagoric or false, but this term is not applicable to Śaṅkara’s philosophical theories. *Rather, the name is a derogatory term which the men of other systems within the Vedānta school used for the thought of Śaṅkara or to the thought resembling his.* Originally, the term *māyā-vāda* always carried an implication of rejection. In later centuries, however, even the Advaita school came to admit that this designation was adopted as a name of its own theories.
