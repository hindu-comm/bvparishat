Although the moderator has requested to move on, I would like to make two comments since I think a list member is being unfairly criticized and moderation is being taking up by non-moderators.



1) The responses on any thread have to be read in the context of the thread, and the chronological sequence of postings is an important part of that context. In this thread, the reference to the use of the term Māyāvāda in Padma Purāṇa Uttarakhaṇḍa verses (as well references to its use by Bhāskara, Vācaspati Miśra, Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja, and the use of the term as documented by Hajime Nakamura) was provided initially by me - these are well-known sources which have used the term in both pejorative and non-pejorative senses. If anybody has a problem with my listing the references, they could have discussed with me off this list or with the moderators. Shri Hari Prashad Dasji merely provided citations, from reliable published sources and without any comments, to verses which were already discussed on the thread. Targeting a post for providing citations is unexpected in an academic forum. Reliable and traceable citations are always welcome in an academic forum – they are useful to both proponents and opponents of a position and form an integral part of any intellectual discussion.



2) The moderators, and only the moderators, are to decide what is suitable and what is not suitable for this forum. When we have one owner and four moderators already on the list, non-moderator members are requested to refrain from making comments like “this is suitable and this is not suitable for this list”.
