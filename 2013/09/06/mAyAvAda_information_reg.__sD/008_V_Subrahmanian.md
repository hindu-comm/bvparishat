Namaste Sunil ji,  

  

There seems to be some pAThabhEda and numbering differences:  
  

The doctrine of MAyA (illusion) is a wicked doctrine and said to be  
pseudo-Buddhist. I myself, of the form of a brAhmana, proclaimed it in  
Kali (age). (padma puraaNa, uttara-khaNDa, 236.7)  
  
After this verse is/are the following:  
  
apaarthaM shrutivAkyAnAM darshayan lokagarhitam \|  
svakarmarUpaM tyAjyatvamatraivapratipaadhyate \|\| Pa Pur 6.236.8 \|\|  

  
It shows the meaninglessness of the words of the holy texts and is condemned  
in the world. In this (doctrine) only the giving up of one's own duties is  
expounded. (padma puraaNa, uttara-khaNDa, 236.8)  
  
sarvakarmaparibhraShTairvaidharmmatvaMtaduchyate \|  
pareshajiivapAraikyaMmayAtupratipAdhyate \|\| Pa Pur 6.236.9 \|\|  
And that is said to be religiousness by those who have fallen from all  
duties. I have propounded the identity of the Highest Lord and the  
(individual) soul. (padma PuraaNa, uttara-khaNDa, 236.9)  
  

While the above verse says:// In this (doctrine) alone the giving up of one's own duties is expounded.// it would be of interest to examine its truth in order to find out whether the interpolator was really having any idea of what he was talking:  
  

In the Bhagavadgita 18.5 we have the Lord say:  
  

Shankaracharya's commentary:  
  
18.5 Yajna-dana-tapah-karma, **the practice of sacrifice, charity and austerity-this threefold practice; na tyajyam, is not to be abandoned**; tat, it; is eva, surely; karyam, to be undertaken. Why? Yajnah, sacrifice; danam, charity; and tapah, austerity; are eva, verily; pAvanAni, **the purifiers, the causes of sanctification; manisinam, of the wise,** i.e. of those who do not seek results for themselves.  
  

*English Translation of Sri Sankaracharya's Sanskrit Commentary - *Swami Gambhirananda**  
  

18.6 Tu, but; api, even; etani, these; karmani, actions, viz sacrifice, charity and austerity, which have been spoken of as purifiers; kartavyani, have to be undertaken; tyaktva, by renouncing; sangam, attachment to them; and by giving up (hankering for) their phalani, results. Iti, this; is me, My; niscitam, firm; and uttamam, best; matam, conculsion. Having promised, 'hear from Me the firm conclusion regarding that (tyaga)' (4) and also adduced the reason that they are purifiers, the utterance, 'Even these actions have to be performed. This is the firm and best conclusion', is only by way of concluding the promised subject-matter; this sentence does not introduce a fresh topic. For it stands to reason that the phrase 'even these' refers to some immediate topic under discussion. The implication of the word api (even) is: 'Even these acts, which are causes of bondage to one who has attachment and who hankers after their results, have to be undertaken by a seeker of Liberation.' But the phrase 'even these' is not used in relation to other acts. Others explain (thus): Since the nityakarmas have no results, therefore (in their case) it is illogical to say, 'by giving up attachment and (hankering for their) results'. The meaning of the phrase etani api (even these) is that, 'even these rites and duties, which are undertaken for desired results and are different from the nityakarmas, have to be undertaken. What to speak of the nityakarmas like sacrifice, charity and austerity!' (Reply:) This is wrong since it has been established by the text, 'sacrifice, charity and austerity are verily the purifiers,' that even the nityakarmas have results. For a seeker of Liberation who wants to give up even the nityakarmas from fear of their being causes of bondage, how can there be any association with actions done for desired results? Moreover, the phrase etani api cannot apply to actions done for desired results (kamyakarmas), since they have been denigrated in, '...indeed, actions is quite inferior' (2.49), and in, '...by actions other than that action meant for God' (3.9), and since, on the strength of the texts \[Which support the two earlier arguments.\], 'the Vedas have the three qualities as their object' (2.45), 'Those who are versed in the Vedas, who are drinkers of Soma,...(pray for the heavenly goal by worshiping) Me' (9.20), and 'they enter into the human world on the exhaustion of their merit' (9.21), it has been definitely stated that actions done for desired results are causes of bondage; and also because they are far removed from the context.  
  

The Br.Up. 4.4.22 'tametam vedAnuvachnanEna brAhmaNA vividiShanti, yajnena, dAnena, tapasA anAshakena..' is the source of the above verse of the Gitaa and the Brahmasutra: sarvApekShA cha yajnAdishruteH ashvavat 3.4.26. The need for and the purpose of veda vihita nitya karma-s is never downplayed or given the go by in all schools of Vedanta, including Advaita, as sampled above. In fact the 'sAdhana panchakam' of Shankaracharya which commences thus:  
  

vedo nityamadhIyatAm taduditam karma svanuShThIyatAm  
  

tenEshasya vidhIyatAm apachitiH kAmye matistyajyatAm.. emphasizes the devout performance of nitya karma and never teaches their giving up unreasonably.  
  

A nityaagnihotrI, for example, of any following, vaishnava/madhwa/smArta, when he takes sannyAsa, has to give up that and related works. Such a giving up is quite vedic in nature and cannot to faulted or held against advaita alone. The Upanishadic averment: na karmaNA na prajayA dhanena tyAgenaike amRtatvam AnashuH and sannyAsayogAt yatayaH shuddha-sattvAH.. are the vedic basis for the approved method/practice of giving up / renouncing sva-karma.  
  
The Gita teaches that even a sarva-karma sannyAsi, a Jnani, will be engaged, or rather the body-mind-sense-motor organs apparatus will be engaged in 'shAreeram kevalam karma' (BG 4.21) in order to maintain the apparatus. Even this action, Shankara says, will go on without the Jnani identifying with it. So, the key to Naishkarmya siddhi is the realization 'na aham kartA' along with, of course, its counterpart 'na aham bhoktA'. This is what is called Self-realization in Vedanta. This is what is meant by 'sarva karma sannyAsa' as established by Shankara in BG 5.13 and 18.12. In this latter bhashya Shankara says: ataH paramARtha-darshinaH eva asheShakarma-sannyAsitvam sambhavati, avidyAdhyAropitatvAt Atmani kriyAkArakaphalAnAm.....na tu ajnasya asheShakarmasannyAsaH sambhavati. This is the meaning of true sannyAsa/i, a word used in the verse itself. **One will gain great clarity of this by reading the bhashyam of BG 5.13 together with 18.12.**  
  
  
The author of the interpolated verses has quite evidently not understood this position of Vedanta. And that is the reason why he says 'this (asat) sastram alone teaches the giving up of all sva-karma' which position is completely at variance with the stated position of Vedanta that we have seen described in the foregoing. To reiterate, the Vedantic 'giving up' of actions is not more physical in nature but the gaining of Atma jnanam, the presence of karma notwithstanding. In the third chapter of the Gita the Lord even instructs that the Jnani remain in the world, amidst ajnanis, doing 'ALL' actions. The fourth chapter has a verse, with this jnani in mind 'karmaNi abhi-pravRtto api' (4.20). The prefix 'abhi' means: excessively, intensely, etc.   
  
  
Shankara, while explaining the subsequent verse 4.24 (brahmArpaNam....) has this jnani who is engaging in karma, in mind: He concludes the 4.24 bhashyam with the words: bAhya chEShTaa mAtreNa karmaapi viduSho akarma sampadyate \[So, here as well, in the case of one who has his ideas of distinctions among accessories like ladle etc., actions and results eliminated by the knowledge of Brahman, even activities which are merely external movements amount to inaction. \] Shankara makes it very clear in this passage:  
  

1.  There is undoubtedly action at the outside/physical level 2.  This invariably involves the sense/motor organs and mind of the
    Jnani 3.  This is confirmed by Shankara by the quoting of verses 3.28 and 5.8
    both of which teach the interaction of the Jnani's sense/motor
    organs with the objects 4.  That the Jnani remaining with the firm convicttion 'I am not the
    doer even when the organs interact with the objects' 5.  This means that the Jnani sees actions, organs, objects and yet
    knows that it is unreal 6.  This is the NaiShkarmya siddhi of Vedanta where in spite of
    body-mind apparatus engaged in less or more of whatever karma, the
    Jnanam that one is akartA is firm.

  
  

The beleagured PadmapurANa verses betray the interpolator's ignorance of not only Advaita shAstra but the very VedantashAstra consisting of the Upanishads, the brahmasutras and the Bhagavadgita where Veda Vyasa's contribution is very significant. All traditional schools hold that the Vedanta sutras, also called 'bAdarAyaNa sutras', are authored by Veda Vyasa who is the author of the Mahabharatha and the purANas. It would be a sad commentary on the authority and knowledge of Veda Vyasa to pitch some verses allegedly from the Padma Purana, his own work, which lay bare contradictions with his own works by saying // In this (doctrine) only the giving up of one's own duties is expounded.// .
Those versed in the Vedanta shastra would not regard those particular verses as genuine for the glaring contradiction sampled above.   
  

One can sample the Sri Ramanuja BhAShya too on the BG verses and see how he too talks about giving up of work, not having the ahankAra while doing work, etc.
