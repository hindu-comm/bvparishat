Exactly these were answered in the quotations from the pages cited without any specific explanation or interpretation in the post of Hariprasad withoutany comment as it was referring to the concept of माया in the Advaita school or the term used for it.



The last question makes the intention of the questioner who is ignorant of anything in the field of Phylosophy than he has heard the word from some other source (which he has not specified) and was confused with मय or wanted to co-relate the term to Mayan Civilization in history or archaelogy he has read. Nothing more was required. I am not sure whether he himself would understand from the references, about any Philosophical theory or if he knows Sanskrit for that. Even for those knowing Sanskrit, the style and the content of the citations is too complex in the pages, to make a reasonable interpretation or translation of the lines.
