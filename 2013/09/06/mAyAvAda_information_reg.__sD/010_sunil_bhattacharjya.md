Namaste,  
  

While comparing the meaning of any verse of the Padmapurana with the meaning of another verse of the Bhagavatam, we have to remember what the Padmapurana itself says about the status of the Bhagavatam among the Puranas.. Padma purana says that the Bhagavatam is the highest of the puranas and that to me is the guideline as to whether the Padmapurana can override what the Bhagavatam says or whether the Bhagavatam can override what the Padmapurana says, in case there are seemingly contradictory views taken by these two Mahapuranas. I would personally like to rely on what the Bhagavatam, the highest of the Puranas say in the event of a conflict.  
  

The Bhagavatam said about the five types of Mukti and also that the Bhaktas are not interested in any of the five types of Mukti. The "Ekatva" type of Mukti is one among the five types of Mukti mentioned by the Bhagavatam. In the "Ekatva" type of Mukti the Jnani realizes oneness with the Lord and this is also the Mukti according to the Advaita. Thus it is clear that the teachings of Advaita has the sanction of the Bhagavatam. If it appears that any verse of Padmapurna is interpreted as saying that the teaching of "Ekatva" Mukti followed by the Advaita is wrong then one has to know that the very interpretation oif the Padmapurana has to be wrong and not necessarily the verse in the Padmapurana.
