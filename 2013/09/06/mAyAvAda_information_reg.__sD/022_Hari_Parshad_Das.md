śrī-śrī-rādhā-dāmodarāya namaḥ

  

dear Sri Nagaraj ji and other esteemed members,

  

there were two questions asked by the member who initiated the thread:

  

who is its founder?  

Are there any specifications on mAyAvAda?  

  

my responses were partly in reply to these queries and partly in continuation with what Sri Nityanand ji said about Bhaskar, Vijnana Bhikshu etc.. Since I have not seen any other citations in the purāṇas, I provided what I had seen to the best of my capacity.

  

Certainly I will not object if any positive references to māyāvāda are provided in this thread. Whatever positive references exist, I would request everyone to bring them out in a non-polemic way.  

  

I am thankful for the references which Sri Nityanand ji and other members provided during the discussion.

  

Also, my intention is not to moderate this forum in any way. I am sure that the admins are more capable for the same.

  

regards,

  

hari parshad das.
