Dear V. Subramaniaan ji and others,

  

When i posted the verses, I did not say at all that it is linked to Advaita or Sri Adi Shankaracharya. I mentioned it clearly that it is "just for reference". I have not made any personal remarks on any personality in my previous email.

  

I am sure that there must be email groups where Nyayamrita vs. Advaita Siddhi are being discussed. I feel that the discussion as to whether these verses refer to any specific personality or not is better suited in that forum.

  

regards,

  

hari parshad das.
