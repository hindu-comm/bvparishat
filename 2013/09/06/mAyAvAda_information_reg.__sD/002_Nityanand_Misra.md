मायावाद is a term used often by opponents of Advaita Vedanta to refer to Advaita Vedanta. These days it is mostly used with pejorative connotations, as a good portion of opposition of Advaita Vedanta in Vaishnava schools revolves around the theory of Maya.  
  
To my information, the term is not used by Adi Shankara in any of his works, and not used by Advaita followers today. It has been used by some Advaita philosophers to describe themselves (e.g. वाचस्पति मिश्र on भामती २/१/२९ says "अस्माकं मायावादिनाम्" - आपातमात्रेण साम्यमुक्तम् परमार्थतस्तु भाविकं परिणामं वा कार्यकारणभावं वेच्छतामेष दुर्वारो दोषो न पुनरस्माकं **मायावादिनामि**त्याह - परिहृतस्त्विति), suggesting the term was probably not used in a pejorative sense historically.  
  
The term मायावाद finds place in Padma Purana, Uttarakhanda, verse 62.31, a verse which the Vaishnavas consider as authentic and Advaita followers consider as a later interpolation.
