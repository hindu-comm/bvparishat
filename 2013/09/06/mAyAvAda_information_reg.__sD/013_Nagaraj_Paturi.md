Dear Sri Hari Prasad Dasji,



1\. It is unfair to guide a neutral seeker of information to a negative comment on the topic.



2\. The thread initiator seems to be as new to the topic as to enquire "Is there any relation between mAyAvAda and Mayan civilization??"



3\. Let me try to provide the neutral information to the enquirer:



 Dear Kumud Prasad Dasji,



1. 'Mayavada' is the name used in reference toa school/tradition of Vedanta called Advaita Vedanta



2. It is popularized (sometimes mistakenly considered to be founded)by Sri (Adi) Sankaracharya.



 3.There is absolutely no relation between Mayavada and Mayan Civilization.



4. Specifications on Mayavada? Do you mean salient features?



 1. To consider Jivatma (individual self ) is nondifferent from Paramaatma(ultimate/cosmic self)



 2. To consider Jagat (manifest universe) to be nondifferent from 'Brahman' ( the ultimately imperishable, uniqueentity )



 3. To interpret the inability of the subject (individual self) to realize the nondifference mentioned in 1 & 2 as 'Maya' (nature/quality of perceiving



 one thing for the other).



 are some of the basic features ofAdvaita Vedanta.



 There are some simple books written for beginners on various schools of Vedanta ( e.g. by Ramakrishna Math)



Just as it happens in any debate,opponent -schools of Vedanta use the word 'Mayavada' in a pejorative sense.



Regards,



 Nagaraj
