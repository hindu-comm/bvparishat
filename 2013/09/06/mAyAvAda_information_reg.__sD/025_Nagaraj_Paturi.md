1\. My response to Sri Hari Parshad Dasji's response to Sri Kumud prasadji was with the same spirit as that of Dr. HN Bhat.



2\. The idea Sri Nityanand Misraji is confirming through his recent post is what I communicated to the enquirer in a beginner-friendly language. I ended my answer by saying : "Just as it happens in any debate,opponent -schools of Vedanta use the word 'Mayavada' in a pejorative sense"



3\. Sri Hari Parshad Dasji's reply in saying:



"there were two questions asked by the member who initiated the thread:



who is its founder?  

Are there any specifications on mAyAvAda?



my responses were partly in reply to these queries"



is still not to my reach. I am confounded to understand how his references were answers to the two questions mentioned here.



4.Sri Nityanand Misraji's recent response helps to understand why it is not reasonable to look for 'positive references' using the word 'mAyAvAvAda'



Readers are witness to the rest.



Regards,



Nagaraj
