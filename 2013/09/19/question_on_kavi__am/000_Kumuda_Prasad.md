Respected Scholars,  

I need some references on concept of Kavi (i.e. types of Kavi, qualification of a kavi, duties of a kavi, sukavi prasaMsA, kukavi nindA and other related concepts).  
  
I got some references regarding this from kAvyamImAMsA of rAjashekhara and kavicintAmaNi of govinda mishra. Besides these two books if there are some other texts related to my said topic, kindly give me some references.  

  

with regards  

Kumuda
