Where did you find the word used in the above meanig?

  

Please place your query supported with the context where you find it so that others also can think of the word and its meaning. Barely your own guessed words or imagined suffixes could be explained by others.

  

Did you find वेश्य in the Apte's dictionary meant for वैश्यवंश्यः? Are you sure it is वेश्य and not वैश्य in the manuscript mistaken for वैश्य?

  

  



The popular word has been explained by Ambal Kulkarni and you may search the word in the tool provided by her. "वेश्या पण्यजीविका" is the popular word. विडेव वैश्यः - ष्यञ् will take आदिवृद्धिः in the case वैश्य. And in the case of यत् or any other suffix, by any rule, will not change the initial vowel into ए, if it is तद्धित suffix.
