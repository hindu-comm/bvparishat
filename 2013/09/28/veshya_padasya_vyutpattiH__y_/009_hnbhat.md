The word you want वेश्य can be derived from the same root ६. १६० विश प्रवेशने with the suffix ण्यत् as per "ऋ-हलोर्ण्यत् ॥ पा.सू.३,१.१२४ ॥" । "अर्हे कृत्य-तृचश्च ॥ पा.सू.३,३.१६९॥" and for the meaning it will give, grammatically वेष्टुमर्हति इति वेश्यः। This is the derivation you want from the root विश् with any suffix to get the word वेश्य. And now for the meaning you have given, you are the authority decide, whether it means वैश्यकुलसंभवः or the grammatical meaning derived from the root as per Paninian grammar. Dictionaries Sanskrit or English do not support such a meaning. You may ask Ambaji or KVK Acharyulu for confirmation, if you are sure of the word and its meaning in your manuscript and you are the editor of the manuscript to decide.

  

But please address personal messages to the persons concerned than copying them to the group. Sorry I have intervened between the message yourself and Ambaji, as you had addressed the personal message to the group.
