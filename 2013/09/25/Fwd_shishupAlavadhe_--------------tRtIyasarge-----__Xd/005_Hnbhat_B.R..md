I think it is not because of simply using phonetic or inscript key board. But many are not typo errors.

  

For example:

  

(*अणीयसा*-अणीयसीभ्यां-अणीयसीभिः-तृतीया बहुवचनम्)  

  

or

  

अनेकाश्च ते धातवश्च-वि.पूर्व.

कर्मधारयः।

  

  

  

I have used phonetic key board without any typo-s to which I am used to. I could not type in using inscript key board lay out. If I do try, I also would probably get typo errors because I am not used to.
