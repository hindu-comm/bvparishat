Namaste Scholars,  
  
Thank you very much for pointing out the printing mistakes and giving the correct version as well as the meaning. You are right in saying that that it indicates the time of marriage. Astrologically the marriage was in an auspicious time but Mother Seeta had to undergo the ordeal in Lanka, which according to Hanuman was due to her having the Saturn in the 8th house at the time of her birth.  
  

Regards,  

Sunil KB
