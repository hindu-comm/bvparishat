I just made few changes in the spacing and one seemingly typo error and now it should be clear:

  

जामाता पुरुषोत्तमो भगवती  लक्ष्मीः स्वयं कन्यका दूतो यस्य  बभूव कौशिकमुनिर्यज्वा वशिष्ठः स्वयम्।

यो दाता जनकः *प्रदानसमये चैकादशस्था ग्रहाः* किं ब्रूमो भवितव्यतां हतविधे रामोऽपि यातो वनम्॥

  

except the underlined phrase which should be explained by the astrologers and astronomers trying to fix the date of the marriage of Sita and Rama as the context depicts. Otherwise the meaning is clear. For me it simply means some auspicious muhUrta of the marriage, that is intended in the line.

  

Astrologers and Astronomers can try their level best with this context to offer their own explanations.
