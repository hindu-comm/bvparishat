Dear scholars,

  

Pranams.

The different interpretations of रससूत्र preserved by Abhinavagupta in the *Abhinavabharati* commentary are well known.

P.S. Subbarama Pattar(1889-1977), an erudite scholar from Kerala (master in Vyakarana and Sahityasastra), has condensed these theories - including that of Abhinavagupta - in seven Sanskrit verses.

The first one of these is reproduced here under.

आलम्बैर्ललनादिभिश्च जनितो ज्योत्स्नादिभिर्दीपनैः

व्रीडाद्यैः परिपोषितो क्षिपदवीं नीतः कटाक्षादिभिः।

प्राधान्यादनुकार्य एव पुरुषे ताद्रूप्यसम्भावना-

दध्यस्तः स्वदते नटे पि रस इत्युत्पत्तिविल्लोल्लटः।।

(The full text is attached ).

Sri Pattar wrote profusely on a wide range of topics - from the theory of Sphota and Grim's phonetic law to Indian economy and agriculture.

He wrote in lucid and chaste Sanskrit. He was at ease with every format - गद्य , पद्य, खण्डकाव्य , स्तोत्रकाव्य, नाटक and कथा.

Most of his writings were published in popular journals like Udyaanapatrikaa (Thanjavur) and Sanskritapratibha (Delhi); and in various local journals of the times.

  

We, the Department of Sanskrit, University of Calicut, are happy to announce that we have brought out a volume containing the Sanskrit works of Sri P. S. Subbarama Pattar under the title *SUBBARAMIYAM*. It happens to be the 47th volume in the Calicut University Sanskrit Series.

  

Sri Pattar was proficient in English also. He wrote a study (in English) on *Dhvanyaloka,* perhaps the first ever study in English on the celebrated work, and published it in 1938 under the title '*Studies on Dhvanyaloka or Reign of Rasa in Sanskrit criticism*'.

  

Through this work, Sri Subbarama Pattar establishes that the sole purpose of Anandavardhana in writing *Dhvanyaloka* is to enunciate a new theory - the theory that the supreme source of aesthetic delectation (as well as the ultimate end of poetry) is realisation of Rasa-s.



The work being out of print, we have reproduced this work also through our Sanskrit Series as the 48th number, under the title '*Reign of Rasa in Sanskrit Criticism*'.

  

For the benefit of those who are eager to know more about our publications, a list of books published through CUSS is also attached herewith.
