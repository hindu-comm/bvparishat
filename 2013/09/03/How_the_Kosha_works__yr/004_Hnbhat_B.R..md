It is clearly stating that the word अन्तर is used in the meanings given in the locative, like रभसो हर्षवेगयोः.

  

It is the common style in नानार्थवर्ग. I could not understand your question. Whatever synonyms of हर्ष and वेग also could be the meaning,
used in the same meaning. But not in a different meaning.

  

You can read Nanarthavarga - in the III kANDA, for different expressions for the same idea and different meanings for the same words. Both are possible. Some will change the meaning used in specific genders, in which case it would be specified immediately.

  

If you can make clear your question, some more details can be provided from Amara itself.
