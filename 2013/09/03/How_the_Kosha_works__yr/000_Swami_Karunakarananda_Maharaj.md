Respected Scholars,  

As I have understood when in Kosha sentences like "उत्क्रोशकुररौ समौ", "अयः शुभावहो विधिः " are used, all the words stated in प्रथमाविभक्तिः have same meaning But in sentences like "रभसो वेगहर्षयोः"- \`the word रभः has the meaning of words वेग or हर्ष when they are *used in their popular meanings*'. Or even their पर्यायपदानि are meant here (i.e, not so popular meanings)?  
  

Is it possible to take the meaning in the reverse order too? Like in sentence ""अन्तरं परिधानीये बाह्ये स्वीयेऽन्तरात्मनि । क्लीबे मध्ये प्रकाशे च " -can we take \`परिधानीय etc are also having the meaning of अन्तरम् '?Please clarify.
