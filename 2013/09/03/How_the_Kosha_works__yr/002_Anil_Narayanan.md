Dear ShriSwami Karunakarananda Maharaj,

  

I would like to rectify something regarding the term ‘homonym’ in the reply I sent to you. What I implied there was ‘naanaartha-s’. The word ‘loka’ can be considered as a ‘homonym’ having two different meanings- poetry and fame. Hope you’ll take this into consideration.
