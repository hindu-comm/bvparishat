Please quote the exact line of explanation. Simply from your lines it seems wrong, if he meant "patra" means



*पलाशं* = *पर्णं**.*. He could have easily quoted as you have done than exlaining praNa can mean palaasha.. The same with the next also.

  

I could not check the reading there in the Telugu Edition, right now as I cannot access efiles.

  

With regards
