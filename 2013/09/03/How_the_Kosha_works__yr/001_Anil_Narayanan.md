Dear shri Swami Karunakarananda Maharaj,

Kosha reads ''padye yashasi ca shlokah'' which means the word 'shlokah' has got two different meanings viz,padya(thepoetry)as well asyashah(fame). To put it in other words, 'the poetry ' and ' the fame ' are the homonyms of 'shlokah', not the synonyms. shlokacan not be the meaning ofyashah. Or simply, when we say the word yashah,we do not get the meaning shlokahor poetry. ie; It is not possible to take the meaning in the reverse order.

  

  

SHLOKAH == PADYA ,YASHAH

But

YASHAH≠ SHLOKAH
