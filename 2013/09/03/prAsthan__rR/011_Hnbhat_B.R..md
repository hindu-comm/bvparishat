Here is the link to Vavilla Ramasvami & Sons publications:

  

2020120000713 - Kiraataarjuneeyam-Part 1 (1-9) - Vavilla Ramaswamy Edition - 1938  

  

2030020024926 - kiraataarjuniiyam - (1-9) - Vavilla Ramaswamy Edition - 1950  



No other way to search for the remaining part. Just searched using different combinations for Bharavi and Kiratarjuniya, under Telugu section which brought some really Telugu Kiratarjinya in 3 parts. But could not find the remaining parts of the same Edition. The above mentioned edition also ends with 10th Sarga.
