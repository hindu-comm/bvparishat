Yes. I too doubted this might be a printing mistake but gave a second thought Mallinatha might have used some unusual form! Where can I get this Vavilla edition? It is unfortunate many scholarly so called editors only put their names but would not have worked sincerely in rectifying printing errors like this one!

I am sorry. Vavilla Ramaswamy Edition available in DLI contains only the first 9 Sarga-s and in [archive.org](http://archive.org) only up to 3rd Sarga.

  

So no chance to check up the above verse.



As it is,समग्रसाधनाः may beसमग्रसाधनानि as the object of प्रास्थन्। the least modification, unless प्रास्थन् is a mistaken form. प्र+स्था would get only आत्मनेपद, as perसमवप्रविभ्यः स्थः १।३।२२ and not परस्मैपद. and in plural it would be प्रास्थिषत and not प्रास्थन् unless it is mistaken form for the later.
