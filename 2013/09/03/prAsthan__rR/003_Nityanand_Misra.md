If the reading is correct, then प्र √अस् (असु क्षेपणे) being सकर्मक, one has to take मुनिमनःप्रलोभनार्थं as the कर्म (and not हेतु) and takes “मुनिमनःप्रलोभनार्थं प्रास्थन्” to mean \[the damsels\] threw forth the wealth/object/manners which were alluring for \[even\] the minds of the sages” - this would be a very unusual usage.

It is likely that the reading is faulty. The statement does not seem to have a कर्म, and so either something is missing from the text or the there is an editorial error. Given the context, I think प्रास्थुः from प्र √स्था (ष्ठा गतिनिवृत्तौ) लुङ् प्रपु बव makes sense but not प्रास्थन्. I.e. प्रास्थुरित्याह instead of प्रास्थन्नित्याह.

From your recent posts, it appears the NSP edition has quite a few printing mistakes in the किरातार्जुनीयम्. Dr. Bhat had quoted the Vavilla Edition on कि. ५/१६ for the correct reading गदतेर्ब्रुवत्यर्थस्य दुहादित्वादप्रधाने कर्मणि लिट् which was misprinted in the NSP edition. Maybe Dr. Bhat can help us again with the reading in Vavilla edition before कि. १०/१.

Any translations of the commentary in English or Hindi or other languages may also be consulted.
