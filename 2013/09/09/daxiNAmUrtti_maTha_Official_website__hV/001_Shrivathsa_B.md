hariH OM,  

svaamii,  
  

 that is great news indeed. the books of the maTha are extremely reasonably priced, even in tens of pages it is difficult to find one typographic error in their books. The dakShiNAmUrti maTha's books and kailAsAshrama's (R^iShikesha) books are the best available for upaniShadbhAShyas of sha\~NkarAcArya (along with Tiikas of Anandagiri, anubhUtisvarUpAcArya, gopAlayatiindra etc.). the kailAsAshrama site is also functioning and their people are extremely helpful.  
  

 Both these Ashrama's books are a reader's delight. they are typeset with good fonts. It is our good fortune that such karmayogis existed among us who could give us error free books even in the days of the old letter printing presses.  
  

 I thank you for having shared the link.  

  

svasti,  

 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,  

 shrivathsa.
