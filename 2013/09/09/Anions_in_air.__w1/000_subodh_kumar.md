How much of this research has been put in practise by leading educational institutions in modern world?

The ancient practise in Gurukuls to regularly perform Agnihotra and hold classes in and around यज्ञशाला ,by creating very Anion rich atmosphere was possibly the reason for the great memory skills developed by our Sanskrit scholars that came from Gurukuls. And this also accounted for how they memorised entire Ved Sanhitas. Sanhitas and great wealth of Sanskrit shastras. Subodh Kumar,
