Namaste.



Sushruta Samhita has an exclusive chapter on *jalaukas*. You may be interested to read the 'जलौकावचारणीयाध्याय' in the Sutrasthana (1.13). In general, turmeric is anti-biotic. It has a permanent place in Indian kitchen. Apart from this, I believe, there are many other tips suggested by Sushruta in the chapter. You may prefer to read the content along with a commentary, *'nibandha sangraha'* of Dalhana.
