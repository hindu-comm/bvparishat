Namaste,

  

 Is AHS the biggest source about "jalauka"? Only part of the text bellow I've found in AHS, the rest maybe never available in Sanskrit. Is there a special treatise or chapter on jalaukas in Ayurveda? And wonder why tumeric water is used. Even AHS states it, but does not explains why.

  

JALAUKA :

(1) Leaches which are nonpoisonous are put in water glass jar or earthen pot, for use.

(2) The local body part where leaches are to be applied is cleaned and dried.

(3) Jalaukas are first immersed in turmeric water and then placed.

 with hand at the spot where desired, for taking out blood.

(4) If the leach is refusing to hold the part. Scratch that part and let drop of blood come out. this attracts the each and it would at once catch the spot.

(5) One leach sucks about 5 - 10 cc of blood; apply 3 to 6 leaches.

(6) When they are full with blood put a drop of salt water on its mouth it will drop. Put the blood ful leach in salt water it will dish out the blood. Clean them as above and use it again.

(7) Dress the spot by Jatyadi oil or Padmakadi oil.

(8) Used Jalaukas can be used again after one month.
