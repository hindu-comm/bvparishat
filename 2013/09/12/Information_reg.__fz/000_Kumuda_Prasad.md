Respected Scholars  

I read a sentence from Nirupta of YAska, but i am unable to locate its exact location in Nirukta. Can anybody help me to get it. The quotation given below-  

**sarasvatI iti etasya nadIvat devatAvehe nigama bhavati.**  
  

And also I have another clarification on sAyaNa's commentary on Rgveda.  

sAyaNa says- dvidhA hi sarasvatI vigrahavat devatA nadIrUpA ca.  
  

I got some reference from a book that it is the commentary on 1/3/12 sUkta of Rgveda. But unfortunately i cann't locate it also. Kindly help me to get its exact reference with sAyaNa's commentary on it (if possible).
