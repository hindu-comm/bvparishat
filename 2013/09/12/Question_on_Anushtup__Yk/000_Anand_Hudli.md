Scholars,  
  
I just wanted to confirm that the following text, consisting of 16 syllables, conforms with the rules of Anushtup meter. Please note the compound word spreads across  
two pAdas of 8 syllables each.  
  
 तत्वमस्यादिवाक्यार्थभाष्याध्ययनशीलिने ।  
  
How about the following? विनीताय सुशान्तायोद्यमशीलाय धर्मिणे । Here, the Sandhi between सुशान्ताय and उद्यमशीलाय occurs at end of the first pAda. As a result, the  
first syllable of the second pAda is "द्य" and not "उ".  
  
Also, can you cite some examples, from Ramayana and MahabhArata, where such long words span across pAdas? Thanks.  
  
Anand
