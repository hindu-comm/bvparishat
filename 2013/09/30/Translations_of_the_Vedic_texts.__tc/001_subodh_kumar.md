Sir,

I may kindly be permitted to give my humble opinion on this subject,

Vedas are an encyclopedic repository of wisdom for welfare of all the creation, and do not lend themselves to easy translation.

To give a very crude analogy, it is like saying that one wants to translate Newton's 'Principia' or Einstein's research on relativity and make it available in all languages. The mission is noble indeed. But the translation (assuming that it is possible ) has to keep in mind the intellectual and academic ability of the audience.

Starting from great souls such as Sage Valmiki in Ramayan, Bhagwan Krishna in Geeta, Buddha, Adi Shankaracharya, Yask, Skand Swami, Sayan
down to Swami Dayanand Saraswati, Rama Krishna,Vivekananda, Raman Maharshi, Aurobindo and so on all have been making great contributions to make message of our shastras available to all.
