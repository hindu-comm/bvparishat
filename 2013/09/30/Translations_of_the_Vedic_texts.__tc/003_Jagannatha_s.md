**(** Mr. Subodhkumar,

Dr. Bhagyalata Pataskar's inquiryis verysimple whichis on
translations of Vedic literature in Indian languages. Newton, Buddha, Vivekananda Einsteinetc are unrelated here. Please don't forget that Dayananda Saraswathi translated Rgveda into Hindi. Aurobindo translated many Suktas into English**)**
