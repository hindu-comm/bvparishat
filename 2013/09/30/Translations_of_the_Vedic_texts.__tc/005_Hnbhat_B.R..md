I don' think Valmiki, Buddha, Krishna or Yaska have made any translations in regional languages. As pointed out by our friend Jagannath, the question is not of all the Shastra-s, or the contribution by different writers, but only the inquiry is about the availability of translations in the regional languages. If you know any translation of the Vedic Literature in any regional language you know, please reply positively about the publication details and availability. And also any Kosha-s on Vedic Words as she has put it "kosha-s in the regional languages only for the Vedic studies." I am not sure whether she intends any Bibliography in regional languages or any Dictionary of Vedic Words. In Sanskrit Vishveshvarananda Institute, Hoshiyarpur has brought out voluminous a वैदिकपदानुक्रमकोश with Grammatical details. And in English, there is Vedic Dictinaries and Concordances, by different authors. And Yaska has produced commentary निरुक्त on the  निघण्टु for Vedic words, which is considered as one of the वेदाङ्ग-s. Any of these translated or compiled in the Indian regional languages, is asked for. And not different languages of the world or of any other books.
