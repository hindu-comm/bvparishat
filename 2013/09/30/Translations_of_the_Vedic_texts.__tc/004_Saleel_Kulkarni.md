Namo Namah,



Dr Pataskar is the head of ‘Vaidik SaMshodhana MaNDala, Pune’.



Presently while translation of much of the vaidik literature is available in English and German but not in all the Indian languages. Many students in the various Indian Universities are studying Sanskrit, Vedas and Shastras etc. in the medium of the local Indian language. It will be a great service for the cause of Sanskrit if any institute can provide translation of all the Vaidik literature in the different Indian languages.



Let us all try to help Dr. Pataskar with whatever kind of help that we can provide.



DhanyavAdAH
