The "RigvedaSamhita" published in 35 Volumes, *contain Aitereya Brahmana from 31-33 Volumes, and Nirukta of Yaska in 34-35 Volumes, with the translation in Kannada by HP Venkatarao. I*t is completely available in CD format in DJVu files.

  

DLI may contain translations in the other regional languages. one can search by languages, Rigveda and so on or simply Veda-s, telugu or Marathi. But only one can get them if they are copyright free AND
available for download uploaded by DLI. And otherwise one cannot get the information.

  

There are some translations in Malayalam also, standardized like that of HP Venkatarao, by a board of Editors. Here is one available translation in Malayalam of Rigvedasamhita, in Internet[http://archive.org](http://archive.org/s)

O. M. C. Narayanan Nambudiripad had translated Rigveda in Malayalam, I do not have the publication details. Some other members may provide. To my wonder, I found the above book in DLI by searching for Rigveda in Marathi, and there is no Malayalam language at all in the language options in DLI search page. And also I could not find any other books on Veda, by searching for Rigveda, in Marathi language. Great DLI. There is option for Telugu, Tamil, Malayalam and Kannada.  

  

Here is the Telugu translation probably

  

Samula Srimadandhra Rigveda Samhita Vol : 1 Parts 1amp2., 2990100028622. Venkata Narasimha Sastry, N.. 1981. telugu. Rigveda Samhita. 1131 pgs.
