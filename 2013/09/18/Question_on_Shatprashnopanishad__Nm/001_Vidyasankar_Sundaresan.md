The object of the text is to provide an example, a dRshTAnta, about prANa. It is notfor dwelling on the life  
cycle of bees swarming and nesting.  

In light of what we know today about beehive colonies, we can easily interpret it as indicating"madhukara-  
rAj\~nIm utkrAmantIM ... tasyAMS ca pratishThamAnAyAM ..." The masculine rAjAna can be seen as merely  
a conventional indication of royalty and rulership, or perhaps as a chAndasa gender substitution. Note that  
interpretations to make sense in terms of common knowledge are always necessary in these texts, without  
necessarily compromising the intent of the text and without prejudice to the text and its transmission. In the  
very same praSna passage, we have forms like "prAtishThante" and "stunvanti," which are not the regularly  
expected ones, requiring interpretation as "pra/prati - tishThanti" and "stuvanti."



Also note, from very recent times, there is an interactive computer game called "King of Bees in Fantasy  
Land" and a rather famous American blues song, "I'm a king bee", both dating from the 1950's-60's. Google  
and Wikipediawill give you all the details of both!Certainly, the science of bees was well known half a  
century ago, so we can't think that the developers of the game or the songwriter really thought bees have  
kings. Sometimes, poetic figures of speech are just that, not to be taken in a literal sense.



Best regards,
