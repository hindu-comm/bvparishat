Abhivadayee All,

  

In an answer to the 2nd question, Pippalada rishi gives a shloka related to bees

  

"tadyathA makshikA madhukararAjAnamutkrAmantaM sarva evotkramant..."

  

Here the reference is to king of bees but modern science says that queen bee is all powerful and all other bees follow her orders. So how do we reconcile here.
