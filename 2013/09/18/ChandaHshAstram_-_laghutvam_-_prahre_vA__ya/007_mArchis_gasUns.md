Wonder if we can use it for reinterpreting CVC syllable structure. For my purposes a word starting with V or C, CC, CCC is equal in some way and if I count statistics, I must suppose that these are the possible word openings, possible variants. Or I could treatसंयोगपर (CC, CCC) all as just C, which is similar to the discussion topic.
