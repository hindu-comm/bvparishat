Use what? Please be clear.

  

By Samyogapara, I meant "a vowel which is followed by a Samyoga" (CC, CCC, CCCC and so on). My usage was a Bahuvrihi (exocentric compound).

  

I wonder how prosodic considerations of conjuncts would help you anyway in your frequency count or your objective. Actually I am not sure about the problem you are trying to solve. If you let me know your end goals I can help better, otherwise the discussion on conjunct frequencies is an endless one - and that too when we have only the univariate distribution of syllables from Oliver's \[slightly dirty\] data. When we start to think of joint probabilities and multivariate distributions we have enough to write a book.
