This has > happened so because of the influence of praakRta and dESya bhaaShaa-s' > influence on Sanskrit prosody. This feature is well noticed and made > as a rule in Kannada and Telugu too as shithila-dvitva. Even music has > influenced prosody in arriving at such stands. One can refer to a > treatise on music like caturdaNDee prakaashikaa where such > consideration is explained with an example too. But none of the > masters of Sanskrit poetry like Kaalidaasa, Bhaaravi, Maagha, > Sriharsha, Vishaakhadatta etc have taken such liberties and so me too > wont exercise such deviations. Only in Kannada and such languages I > rarely use this as the master poets here have used this feature at > ease
