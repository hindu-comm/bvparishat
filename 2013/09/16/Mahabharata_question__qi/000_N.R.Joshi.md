Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



My friend has given me this information---



The critical edition does have the reference

MB(12.4.7)

"srgAlashca mahArAja strIrAjyAdhipatishca yaH"



I have writtem before on the ancient Ladies' Kingdom. This reference tells me the SRgAla (ShRgAla) was the king of StreerAjya. But SRgAla (ShRAala) mean either jackal or wolf.

Scholars of Mahabharat please help me. Does this verse mean what it says?



Dr. Sadashiv Murthi and RNI might be interested in this. Thanks. N.R.Joshi
