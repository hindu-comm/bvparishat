Anyhow does it clearly show anything in respect of the ancient usage of प्रातःस्मरणीय in the topic raised? i.e. Whether it is used in respect of departed souls or living persons?

  

Set Aside whether it is in respect of Gods either Shiva or Vishnu. The usage of the word was questioned and nobody has yet tried to reply to the point.

  

Good BVP. There was a time of scholars, when they confine to their discussions to the point:

  

नामूलं लिख्यते किंचित् नानपेक्षितमुच्यते।

  

even though they were capable of debating.
