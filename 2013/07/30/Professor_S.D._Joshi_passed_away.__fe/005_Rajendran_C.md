Prof.Deshpande, thanks a lot for sharing your experiences.What made Professor Joshi a unique person was the manner in which he combined the best of Western and Indian scholarship, without belittling either, which has become a fashion nowadays. He always wanted to revamp Indological research in India so that it could retain the high standards it had set in the past.I remember how once he called upon youngsters to be true researchers by doing original research.He deplored the tendency to rehash everything already said and writing research papers and theses without bothering to review the work already done.If we could revive the glorious Poona tradition of erudition and hard work, that would be a befitting tribute to Prof.Joshi's memory.
