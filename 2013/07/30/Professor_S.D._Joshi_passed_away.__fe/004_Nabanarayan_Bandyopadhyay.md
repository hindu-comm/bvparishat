Dear Prof. Deshpande,

The sad demise of Professor S.D. Joshi is an irreparable loss to the Sanskrit world. We fondly remember his contribution to the establishment of the School of Vedic Studies at Rabindra Bharati University, Kolkata, in 1986, when he was an expert member of the UGC Visiting Committee formed for the purpose. We are thankful to you for sending a brief biography of him. It will help us more if his bibliography is also mailed. We pray--may his great soul rest in peace!
