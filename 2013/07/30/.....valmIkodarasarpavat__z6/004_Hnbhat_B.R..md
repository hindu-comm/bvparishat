This is like a guess from any verse.

  

In fact, Mr. Saccidananda Mishra was right in his memory and the verse is in Pancatantra as he suggested:

  

परस्परस्य मर्माणि ये न रक्षन्ति जन्तवः \|

त एव निधनं यान्ति वल्मीकोदर-सर्पवत् \|\|३।१९१\|\|

  

Without consulting the original source of the verse, anything can be guessed as done by V Subrahmanyam, even without reading the verse itself carefully.

  

The verse itself clearly states that wicked people without keeping each others' mortal spot (i.e. exposing each others' vulnerable points (मर्म) to others), will destroy themselves, like the serpents at the ant-hill.

  

And this is concerned with the two serpents only in the story which out of angry expose the mortal point of each other and get killed. So this verse has nothing to do with the ants in the ant-hills or the serpents in any वल्मीक.

  

So the purport of the verse is this much:

  

People exposing the mortal vulnerable points of each other, get killed like the serpents at the ant-hill.

  

In the story, there was a serpent in the stomach of a prince, which could not be got out by any treatment by any physician. Wandering here and there, he came to be married to a princess, who had to put herself, with him, who was living by the side of a वल्मीक. The serpent from his stomach, came out when he was asleep to inhale air for its food and at the same time another serpent living protecting a treasure in the anthill also came out for the same purpose. And seeing each other, they tried to tease each other and exposed the secrets for their destruction during the conversation, how to expell them from their abodes. Hearing the secrets, the princess got both the serpents destroyed and got her husband cured and procured the teasure killing the other serpent, following the way exposed by them.

  

This is the moral. People could not keep their vulnerable points get killed themselves (by exposing them for any reason) like the serpents in the anthill.

  

Sorry for the lengthy message to make the moral in the verse clear.
