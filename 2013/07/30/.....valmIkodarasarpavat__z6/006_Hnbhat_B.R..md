परस्पराणि मर्माणि ये वदन्ति नराधमाः ।

परस्परं क्षयं यान्ति वल्मीकोदरसर्पवत् ॥

  

Now, the variant readings in the Subhashita quoted, makes the reference to both the serpents, while in Hitopadesha, it apparently relates to the one serpent in the वल्मीक, but not any difference in the moral of the verse. But in the story, it is the serpent in the Valmika, that entangles in quarrel, with the guest serpent, and finally both get killed.

  

परस्पर-दर्शनेन क्रोध-संरक्त-लोचनयोर्मध्याद्वल्मीकस्थेन सर्पेणोक्तम्-भो भो दुरात्मन् ! कथं सुन्दर-सर्वाङ्गं राज-पुत्रम् इत्थं कदर्थयसि ?

  

Both quarrelling with each other, expose the secret of each others' mortal point. Otherwise both would have been safe in their abodes which makes the general statement in the subhashita quoted

  

परस्पराणि मर्माणि ये वदन्ति (=न रक्षन्ति) नराधमाः (x जन्तवः)।

परस्परं क्षयं यान्ति (त एव निधनं यान्ति) ......



Possibly these two variant versions also could be found in different recension of the text of Pancatantra.
