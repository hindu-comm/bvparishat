One more post script:

  

वल्मीकोदरसर्पवत् = वल्मीके उदरे च यौ सर्पौ, वल्मीकोदरसर्पौ, तौ इव, परस्परं क्षयं यान्ति।

or त एव निधनं यान्ति। which refers to both the serpents, in the ant-hill and the stomach (of the prince) and it does not mean the serpents inside the वल्मीक as V Subrahmanyam seems to have guessed its meaning.

  

The same with the title of the story also:

  

वल्मीकोदर-गत-सर्प-कथा
