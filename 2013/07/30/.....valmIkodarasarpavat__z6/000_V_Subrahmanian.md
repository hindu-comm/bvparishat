Namaste  
  
I request the esteemed scholars here to kindly help me an aspect of this subhAShitam verse:  
  
परस्पराणि मर्माणि ये वदन्ति नराधमाः ।  
परस्परं क्षयं यान्ति वल्मीकोदरसर्पवत् ॥  
  
In the example, is there a mutual destruction brought about by the ants/anthill and the snake that resides in the anthill ? Or else does the snake residing in the anthill undergo destruction? I have heard that the snake does not build its own house; it occupies an anthill.
Pl.help me understand the verse.
