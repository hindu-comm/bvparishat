Namaste,  
  
Thank you for tracing the original source of the verse and its interpretation. Once I was interested in the source of the ancient Indian martial arts and came to know about the Marma shthaanas or Marma-bindus (Vital points in English) as disclosed by the Sage Agastya. There are 108 of them, out of which 107 are physical points in the body of a human being and the 108th is probably the most important, as it is the mind itself.  
  
Regards,
