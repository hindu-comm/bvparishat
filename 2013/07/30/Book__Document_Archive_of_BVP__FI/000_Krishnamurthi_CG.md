Dear BVP,  
  

It will be worthwhile to consider setting up an Archive of books and research documents, etc. of the various members of BVP (from their private collection) - what ever each one can share. All most 40% of the time the queries to BVP is about a particular book or paper etc. This archive can become the first or may be last source of search for any particular book /paper.  
  

Over a period this can become a sizable repositary. May be duplication of some of the archives already in place, yet still wrt. Samskritam one can (should) have as many sources as possible.  

  

I can help the existing team of volunteers of BVP in categorising, archiving, maintaining, etc.  
  

Warm regards  

CG Krishnamurthi
