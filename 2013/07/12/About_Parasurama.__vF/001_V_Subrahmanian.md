While I am not sure of the thinking that Parashurama being a Shiva bhakta, one can see that Vishnu Himself is the greatest shivabhakta.
There are references to Krishna's Shivabhakti in the Mahabharata. Shiva is the greatest Vishnubhakta too. 'hara vaiShNavottama' is a (kannada) slogan of the Dvaita school.
