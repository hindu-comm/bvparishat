Please read the Purana-s related to Parasurama indexed in any PuraNic Index:

  

Here is the one online Index:

  

<http://www.angelfire.com/indie/vedastudy/pur_index17/pva7.htm>  

  

<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EDKBX6zgbBciLY-TU5pGc4eaBfLLC5mVx-2iKDcFryo/edit>  

  

  

Instead of discussing whether Parasurama is a Shivabhakta or Hara as Vishnubhakta to find the answer to the question. Don't go on your own speculations or any website blogs for that.

  

There are some other Puranic Indexes published also and please refer to them before placing such an vague question as I feel, or it is considered as .... etc.
