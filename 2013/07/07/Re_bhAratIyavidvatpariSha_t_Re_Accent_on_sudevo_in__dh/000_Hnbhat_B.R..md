I don't know. You are one of the readers of this group. Different individuals with different interests are members of this group and if there is any one interested in any topic he is expected to go through. Nobody can compel anyone to read or restrict any topic except polemic.

  

What is the matter? One is free to ignore the topics, one is not interested and those interested are welcome to read. I expect one more member to come up.

  

What is the issue now?
