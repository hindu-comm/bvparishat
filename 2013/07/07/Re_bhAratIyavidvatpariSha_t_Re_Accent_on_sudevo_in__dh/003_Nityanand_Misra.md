There is no doubt that Vedic had accents, and even Laukika Samskrita had accents in the time of Panini (4th century BCE) and possibly in the time of Patanjali as well. Panini devotes many Sutras to treat accent in both Veda and Loka.

This probably happened after Patanjali, when the use of Samskrita as a spoken language declined.

  

Among the modern Indian languages I know, Punjabi is tonal with at least three types of accents. See here for a paper on the spectral and temporal analysis of tones -

PS: Where I live, the spoken language has nine tones, with six part of words in daily conversations!
