Accent is vital for determining the meaning of Vedic words. Those who are engaged in Vedic interpretation have necessarily to be careful about accent. One of the sources of determining accent is Pāṇiṇi’s Aşṭādhyāyī. Others are good editions, Wackernagel’s Altindische Grammatik, Whitney’s Sanskrit Grammar etc. Those who interpret the Vedas according their own understanding do not need these.

Another point for Dr. Bhat. I know the Kannad script. A conclusion about the prevalence of the Paippalāda-Saṃhitā of the Atharvaveda in ancient Karnataka had to be drawn by me on the basis of the Kannad script of the 6^(th) century (AVP new ed. Vol.2, 2008:lxix, Asiatic Society, BI Series 319, Kolkata) The current script was much easier to learn.
