On the dialectal base of Vedic Sanskrit one can at best speculate on the basis of analogy. That will not be acceptable to those who believe that the Vedas are eternal and its language divine ie not based on human speech.

For those who are relatively profane the analogy may be of the development the standard dialect of modern languages with a base dialect of a central cultural area of the speakers. Standard Hindi has Khaṛi boli of the Delhi area or the mixed cultured speech of Lucknow as its base, Bengali the Śāntipur dialect in which Chaitanyadev spoke subsequently considerably modified by Tagore’s language that draws additional features from the dialects of Kolkata and Khulna-Jessore. Oriya has the Cuttack dialect as its base, Telugu (East) has the Vijayawada dialect and so on. Vedic must have had one but to find out that after so many years may be impossible.

Accent is still a living thing. Look at the Bhojpuri of Chhapra and Balia whose intonation cannot escape anybody’s notice. Similarly, the dialectal intonation of Bengali in Mursidabad or Dacca is far from the stressed accent of standard Bengali. Examples will be a legion. But we do not mark them in written speech excepting when one likes to add sarcasm.
