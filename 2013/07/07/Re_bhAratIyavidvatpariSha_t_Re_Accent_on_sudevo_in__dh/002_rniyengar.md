Dear Members,

Both the query and the answer are interesting! While I am not capable of discussing the grammatical intricacies involved in Vedic accents, which only specialists can do, I am always intrigued by the existence of accents and their preservation. I wonder whether the text is preserved due to the accents or vice versa! My personal belief after having gone through the RV (Mysore palace edition in Kannada script) and YV with Sanskrit commentaries, the overall meaning (of a hymn or verse) is not affected. The only example to the contrary that is usually cited is the famous "indra s'atrurvardhasva svAhA" If there are other examples where the tAtparya of a hymn gets dramatically changed I would like to be educated. On the other hand existence of accents is a sure sign of identifying a vedic text. A distinctly different dimension is the evolution of the (Uda,Anu,Sva) triplet to further modulations in the chanting of the sAmaveda. As a lay person I can not help recognizing at least five (or may be more) svaras in the sAma heard even on TV programs. Controlled spectral analysis of the RV, YV and SV chants would be scientifically very interesting to trace the historical development of Indian classical music. A question related to the existence of accents in Vedic texts is: do we accept that the spoken language in the RV period had accents? I know for traditionalists this question is not very relevant because RV, YV,... have no beginning. Even then when, why and how the change to accentless language (vedangas, sutras, nirukta) happened?

  

I hope scholars will enlighten me on some of the above points.

  

kind regards
