Namaste  
  
This is a request to members here to suggest a few good renderings in audio lectures on popular works like the shAkuntalam, raghuvamsham, kumArasambhavam, etc. The language in which the *detailed expositions of these entire texts* are rendered could be Sanskrit, Hindi, Telugu, Kannada and Tamil. Renderings by accomplished scholars will be a treat to listen and also bring about appreciation of these original Sanskrit works apart from helping develop one's Sanskrit language abilities.  
  
I hope there are such online resources too.  
  
Thanks and regards
