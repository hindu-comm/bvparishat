    Many thanks!

*sudevá*- occurs at least seven times in the RV. In six of them it is a bahuvrīhi compound. In 8.69.12 it is an adjective of Varuṇa, and hence difficult to be paraphrased as ‘शोभनो देवो यस्य’. But Patañjali Paspaśā vs.13 paraphrases सुदेवो ऽसि as सत्यदेवो ऽसि and draws the moral सत्यदेवाः स्याम which is a bahuvrīhi. Patañjali takes *su* in the sense of *satya*! *deva* then shouls stand for *devatva*.

Whatever the compound may be the word is antodātta and we cannot by any means change an authentic reading.
