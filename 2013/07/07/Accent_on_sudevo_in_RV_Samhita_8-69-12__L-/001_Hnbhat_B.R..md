I think you are correct. Here are the extracts from different editions:

  

1\. Quoted in the Anandashrama Edn. of Nirukta

probably the notation under "su" is not clear as the one under दे.

  

Here is the edition of Maxmuller with Sayana Bhashya which agrees with your assumption:

Here also the notation under सु is not clearly visible. But it is also अनुदात्त. This can be confirmed with the notation in Kannada Edition from Mysore of the same. I remember you mentioned some time ago you can read Kannada alphabets.

which has clearly noted the अनुदात्तस्वर on both. which agrees with your assumption. Though none of them have explained the notation, they are consistent with each other unlike the pdf files available in the webpages.
