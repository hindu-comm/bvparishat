Thanks for the clarification and firm stand. Just we wanted to know and confirm the consistent form of the word with accents marked uniformly with rules of related स्वर and not with the intention of changing it. If you can confirm the notation in the Maxmuller's Edition as given in the snapshots and the clearly followed by the board of Editors from Mysore in Kannada script (though you do not know Kannada script, I am sure they both agree) and the notation of the same word in in the Nirukta text Edited with Durgacharya's commentary, is correct and hold good whether it be तत्पुरुष as it appears to be in the commentary सुदेवः = कल्याणकारकः देवः or as you have suggested in the commentary in महाभाष्य, we have to take बहुव्रीहिः as शोभना देवाः यस्मिन् सः, सुदेवः, the accentuation remains the same due to the operation of सतिशिश्टस्वर. as explained in the general rule अनुदात्तं पदमेकवर्जम्. There is no other compound possible than these two. In the case of Mahabhashya, Kaiyata remarks,

and the word सत्यदेव is explained by नागेश as

  

सत्येन दीव्यती = द्योतते, इति यौगिकोऽयं शब्दः, तथान्येष्वपीत्यर्थः।

  

  

Here also the prescription of स्वर-s follow the same as in other prescription पर-नित्यान्तरङ्गापवाद and सतिशिष्ट which specially applicable in the case of स्वरप्रक्रिया only as per काशिका ---

  

"परनित्यान्तरङ्गापवादैः स्वरैर् व्यावस्था सतिशिष्टेन च।"

  

Just wanted to know whether it can be explained in the same way of प्रक्रिया we learnt that of रामः in लौकिक words and following all the applicable स्वरविधि- rules till the final form we see.

  

Thank you for confirming the consistent form in the standard Editions.

  

With regards
