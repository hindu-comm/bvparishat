If you mean 6-2-195 सोरवक्षेपणे, then firstly that is applicable only if the sense is निन्दा (अवक्षेपण), and secondly it has the अनुवृत्ति of उत्तरपदस्य which runs from 6-2-143 अन्तः till end of the पाद (6-2-199 परादिश्छन्दसि बहुलम्). I do not think निन्दा is the sense here and even if it were, the Sutra explains the अन्तोदात्तत्व of the उत्तरपद and says nothing about the पूर्वपद (सु).  
  
So I think neither 6-2-172 नञ्सुभ्याम् nor 6-2-195 सोरवक्षेपणे explain the अनुदात्तत्व of सु, as they both deal with उत्तरपद only. It may be worth looking into accent rules for पूर्वपद.  
  
As Dr. Bhat has said a स्वरप्रक्रिया will be the प्रमाण here.
