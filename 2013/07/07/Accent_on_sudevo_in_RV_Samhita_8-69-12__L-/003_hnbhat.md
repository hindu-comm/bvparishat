The two snapshots of the relevant text given by me are from the Nirukta Edition with Durgacharya's commentary by Pt.Shivadatta sharma and the Edition of Rigveda by Maxmuller, Also by the Mysore Board of Editors of Sayana Bhashya, in Kannada Script. All these agree with it.

  

Thanks for the relevant quoting सूत्र, for सुदेव. Just out of curiosity peeped into the sUtra, and it relates to the second member in बहुव्रीहि with सु. And if it is applied, the word सुदेव will be a बहुव्रीहि compound. If तत्पुरुष it will become subject to some other restrictions under तत्पुरुष; excepted from the rule

सोरवक्षेपे (६.२.१२५). as aper Nirukta:

सुदेवस्त्वम् कल्याणदेवः कमनीयदेवो वा (५,२७)  

सुदेवः = कल्याणदेवः,(१४,२७)

as it appears it seems to be प्रादिः तत्पुरुषः and not बहुव्रीहि as required by the rule you have quoted. Some more insights may be needed to fix the applicability of accent rules in this case. a complete प्रक्रिया based study of स्वर-s. Anyy how, the three different Editions from 3 different editors at different times agree with the accents on the word in this verse as the snapshots from the Editions make clear.
