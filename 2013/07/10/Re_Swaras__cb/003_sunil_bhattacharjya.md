Namaste,  
  

I thnk your paper will be of interest to many of us and you may please give the url, so that we can have a look at your paper. If my memory serves me right, about two decades ago the physics department of the Poona University, conducted a voice appreciation program for the Classical music and that was on scientific lines. To my understanding all frequensy analysis etc.of voice was carried out and demonstrated. Would you think such an analysis of the Sapta-swaras will be relevant here. It may also be possible that over the years that department of the Poona University could have carried out many more such programs.
