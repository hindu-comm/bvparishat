Now the discussion appears to veer towards present day management principles. In other words, I used to say that what is said in Vedas is the present good corporate governance. I am not good at Sanskrit but understand.  I leave it Vedic Scholars to come out with a definite statement and not subjective.  With Warm Regards to all.  R. Ramanisundaram\*
