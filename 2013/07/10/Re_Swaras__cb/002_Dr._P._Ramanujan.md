I have been researching on "Accental Semantics" of Vedic texts where  
creation from Word is described and accents refer to categories of objects  
and hence 'meaning change' actually means undesirable  
objects/events/results. Indrasatru is not the only example, since ALL  
Vedic words ae equally potent.  
The word 'sudevo' about which Sri Nityananda Misra started the discussion  
itself has many connotations as seen from the commentaries.  
Lakshana granthas like sikshas delve deep on such matters.  
I wanted to send my earlier paper on this to Dr. RN Iyengar, but due to  
some font problem in rendering accents, I could not do so immediately.
