Here is a refreshing article...

**Sanskrit should not be Greek to many**

by Reshmi R Dasgupta

The Economic Times  

In the past year, I’ve met two young Indians who have fallen in love with classical Greek. While it traditionally takes three examples for a journalist to declare a ‘trend’, this discovery is so arcane that even two is worth a comment. More so as it appears to tie in with a revival of interest in Latin and Greek among youngsters in the West.

  

Unbelievable as it may sound, it is now cool to study or teach Latin and Greek, unlike the days of Mr Chips when inky public school boys were hauled over the coals for conjugations and parsing. Sanskrit, alas, remains stuck in that rut, as generations of Indian school children agonise over verbs, not quite sure why they have to do so.

  

When BJP president Rajnath Singh lamented last week that only 14,000-odd people “spoke” Sanskrit in India today, he should have trained his guns on the way it is taught. Instead, he sanctimoniously declared that Anglicization (aka English) was killing Indian culture, and by extension, Sanskrit. But he’s barking up the wrong tree.

  

Both, the Indian boys told me, were attracted by the sheer beauty of the Greek language, a refreshingly frank and simple reason to study it. Unfortunately, such is the educational system here and the imperatives of modern India, students and parents judge everything on ‘relevance’ or ‘scope’, which translates into “earning potential”.

  

Sanskrit, measured in those terms, comes off poorly. What does proficiency in Sanskrit line up in terms of jobs? A chance to read the 6.55am news bulletin in Sanskrit every day on All India Radio. A reporter in one of India’s three Sanskrit newspapers. A Sanskrit rock band, maybe… But would it open up places in banks, MNCs or consultancies?

  

Pointers should be taken from the West where there is a sea change in how interest is kindled in classical Latin and Greek. In specialist schools in the US, students just don’t mug up dry Greek and Latin passages as our Indian students do with Sanskrit. Instead, their education is solidly grounded on three classical rules – grammar, logic and rhetoric.

  

The youngest kids (when brains are at their highest absorption capacity) learn the rules – of language and spelling, maths and science, ancient history and literature. Then as they grow, they learn how to discern, evaluate, question and discuss. So, they establish an attitudinal link with the great classical traditions even as they live in the cyber age.

  

Contextualising the principles of Latin and Greek without spuriously connecting it to modern life is the key. Our Sanskrit curriculum attempts to do just the opposite here, that too, ham-handedly. Call it chauvinism or plain pigheadness on the part of its advocates, but Sanskrit is posited in a vain “it’s you or me” battle with English.

  

How would learning to write a job application in Sanskrit benefit a youngster here? For that, English and Hindi are the obvious choices. Instead, if studying the great classical Sanskrit texts honed her skills of logic and articulation, it would stand her in good stead in interviews, applications, and even sales pitches and Powerpoint presentations.

  

Unfortunately, beyond its standing as the root of most Indian languages, Sanskrit is regarded by many as a synonym for the Hindu religion, and a Brahmin or an upper caste monopoly.

  

Its salvation and future lies in breaking those misconceptions and focussing instead on the vast secular riches embedded in its classical texts, poetry and philosophy. If even Indian youngsters can be attracted to the timeless virtues of Latin and Greek today, the current proponents of those two ‘dead’ languages are clearly getting something right. Sanskrit has every right to be put on the same plane as these two classical languages, giving Indian youngsters the benefit of its 5,000-year-old wisdom
