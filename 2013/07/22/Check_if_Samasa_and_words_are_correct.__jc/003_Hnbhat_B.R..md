Anyhow I don't understand what do you want by creating "a word"

  

You have first stated

  

" one who has visited all good places"

  

WHICH has nothing to do with the word you have created, 

  

as yourself translated it as रम्यप्रदेशावतिष्ठपताकः



"which means he has kept his banner in all beautiful places"

  

So please be clear of what do you want and ask others whether it is correct that it would give the meaning you intended. If yourself are not sure of it, how can others suggest any word or any correction to the word you have given?

  

First please make clear what do you want?
