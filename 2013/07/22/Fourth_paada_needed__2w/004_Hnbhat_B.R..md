caturthaM naiva vidyate. in the first pAda, gurushushrUShayA  

  

  

  

It is always possible in the web to have distorted readings in of the popular sayings, according to their knowledge.

  

As I have known it for long since I had my Sanskrit Lessons from teacher, I have heard only as

  

चतुर्थी नोपलभ्यते which goes well in accordance with the the उपक्रम = विद्या in the beginning also, चतुर्थी विद्या नोपलभ्यते naturally. Otherwise one can take अध्याहार appropriate in the neuter or masculine
चतुर्थः प्रकारः, or चतुर्थं as क्रियाविशेषण or anything सामान्ये नपुंसकम्. in common gender, if one wants to justify his reading, which is not naturally feasible in the verse.

  

The same thing has happened in the case of another most quoted verse:

  

आचार्यात् पादमादत्ते ... etc.

  

one can see so many readings on the web.
