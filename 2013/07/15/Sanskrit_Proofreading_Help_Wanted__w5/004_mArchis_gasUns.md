What did you want to say?

I need help adding the Sanskrit translation (text entry) of Palsule's 3690 dhatus. I have all the dhatus and Paninis meanings entered myself, but Palsule has a lot of more than that - but one man is not enough to fight all of it. Two different scans can be provided of Palsule's Dhatupatha Concordance.
