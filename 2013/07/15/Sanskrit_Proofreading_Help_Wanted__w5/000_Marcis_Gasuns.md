Namaste,

Colleagues from India and abroad, I'm looking for your help. I'm the founder of <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/nagari> and lately have reopened access to rare Sanskrit related scans, like <http://samskrtam.ru/kewa-ewa/> (which was made possible with Manfred's written permission).  
I work on several books on Sanskrit in Russian and would ask for your advice and help. For example there is a Sanskrit Reader  
(<https://www.dropbox.com/s/0a03seokbpizf2w/prefilght.pdf>). Other big projects include translation of Apte's Composition, Buhler's Leitfaden, Ayurvedic Sanskrit and compiling a Sanskrit Dhatupatha based on dictionaries.  
Any help would be appreciated. I can help with fonts, both latin and devanagari, convertion tools - I'm pretty good at doing it in EmEditor text editor, Word 2007, InDesign 6.0.

Warm regards from Russia,  
Marcis Gasuns, Krasnodar
