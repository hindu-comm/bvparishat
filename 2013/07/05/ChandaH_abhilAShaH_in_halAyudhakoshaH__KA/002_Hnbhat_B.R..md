३.२.२६८) विधुरं तु प्रविश्लेषेऽभिप्रायश्छन्द आशयः\|\|  

  

I think the answer is simple. It is not अभिलाषः but आशय for छन्द\[स्\] may be both सकारान्त and अकारान्त. which gives the word स्वस्य छन्दः - स्वच्छन्दः, कामकारः। But a commentator on the above line

  

notes :

  

साहचर्येण पुंलिङ्गत्वाद् अकारान्तत्वम्। which can be also छन्दस् सकारान्त but for this साहचर्य. This has to be looked for in शब्दभेदप्रकाश

  

मूर्धरेफादयो ज्ञेयाः छन्दोभङ्भयादिह । छन्दावभिप्रायवशौ --  

  

  

स्वच्छन्द - itself conveyed by the word छन्द also as per the above snapshot.

  

by स्वैराचारः \|

  

More kosha-s might be looked into for finding सकारान्त word छन्दस् meaning the same as अकारान्त to get confirmation.

  

The next is very simply convey the meaning metre by the छन्दस् सकारान्त as is popularly used to syllabic structured constuction - metrical structure

  

नियत-वर्ण-मात्रादिः शब्दगुम्भभेदः - popularly known as मात्राछन्दः, वर्णच्छन्दः, and छन्दश्शास्त्रम्।

  

in other words वर्णवृत्त and मात्रावृत्त structure is meant. In extended sense, it can convey the पद्य also composed using the छन्दस् -

  

I think to some extent the problem is solved.
