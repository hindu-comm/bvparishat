He is giving here the meaning स्वैराचार for छन्दस् along with other meanings and not as synonym for अभिलाष. I have already explained. This second part of the edition serves as a dictionary collecting all the meanings for the words listed in the हलायुधकोश more than a simple word Index of words. Hence you cannot find under the listing in the main part, the body of the कोश which just lists the synonyms for वेद and उपनिषत् in the portion you have quoted.

  

And for the second meaning, स्वैराचार, अभिलाष he has taken it from मेदिनी ---

  

(३.३.८४१) छन्दः पद्येऽभिलाषे च as per अमर itself, plus the commentary quoting मेदिनी ---

It is found in the मेदिनीकोश as verse No.22 under सत्रिक. which clearly shows it is सान्त also, than अकारान्त meaning अभिप्राय as given in अमर earlier under अभिप्राय.

  

Hope now there is no question at all. The second question has been already solved.

  

With regards
