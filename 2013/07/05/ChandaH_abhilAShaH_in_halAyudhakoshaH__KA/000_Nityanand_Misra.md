Dear scholars  
  
I am referencing a text which cites a meaning of छन्दः as अभिलाषः. One of the sources I found ascribed the meaning to Halayudha Kosha.  
  
Below is a snapshot from Jaishankar Joshi (edited). 1993. हलायुधकोशः (अभिधानरत्नमाला). Lucknow: Uttar Pradesh Hindi Sansthan. pp. 307 (This publication is very useful as it first has the original Kosha and then the words in alphabetical order). On page 307, two meanings of छन्दः are given as वेदः and स्वैराचारः/अभिलाषः. The citation is verse 9.  
  
Verse 9 reads  
वेदः श्रुतिस्तथाम्नायः स्वाध्यायश्छन्द आगमः  
वेदान्तश्च रहस्यं च बुधैरूपनिषन्मता  
  
I see only the वेद meaning for छन्द in the verse but not the स्वैराचारः/अभिलाषः. meaning. I looked up the listing for अभिलाषः also but could not find the छन्दः word there.  
  
Does anybody have any idea what is meant by नियतवर्णमात्रादिः/शब्दगुम्फभेदः? Or is there a commentary/variant reading which has the अभिलाषः meaning for the word छन्दः?
