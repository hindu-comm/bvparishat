Many thanks to all scholars for their responses. I think what Dr. Bhat has said makes perfect sense - "This second part of the edition serves as a dictionary collecting all the meanings for the words listed in the हलायुधकोश more than a simple word Index of words." I was expecting all meanings listed by Joshi to be from Halayudha, but he has given meanings from other sources also which for छन्दः include स्वैराचारः/अभिलाषः and शब्दगुम्फभेदः/पद्यम् (which I earlier thought referred to alternate readings and the पद्य number in हलायुधकोशः). So the अभिलाषः meaning is probably not from the original हलायुधकोशः.  
  
Dr. Bhat is also correct in pointing out the difference between the अकारान्त (घञन्त) and सकारान्त (असुन्नन्त) words. There is one reference from वैयाकरणसिद्धान्तकौमुदी where भट्टोजिदीक्षित uses the सकारान्त as a synonym for इच्छा (=अभिलाषः) -  
  

'छन्दसो निर्मिते’ (पा.सू. ४/४/९३)   

छन्दसा निर्मितं छन्दस्यम्। इच्छया कृतमित्यर्थः। (वै.सि.कौ, १६४५)

Once again thanks to everybody.
