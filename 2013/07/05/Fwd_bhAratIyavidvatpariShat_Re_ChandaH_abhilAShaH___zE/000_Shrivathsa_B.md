hariH OM,  
nityanand,  
  

 i think the niyatavarNamAtrAdiH goes with another definition: yadakSharaparimANam tacchandaH. niyatavarNamAtrAdiH = something where varNas follow a niyama.  
  

 the usage of yadi te cChandaM etc. one comes across. for example, rAmAyaNa, ayodhyA, 118, shloka 51 (giita press edition), there is "pitushChandam".  
  

svasti,  

 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,  


shrivathsa.
