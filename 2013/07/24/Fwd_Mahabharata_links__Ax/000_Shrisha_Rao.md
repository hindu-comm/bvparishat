1) Another encoded edition of complete Mahabharata (Kumbhakonam edition, other than Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute's edition encoded by Tokunaga) is now available at SARIT site <http://sarit.indology.info> <http://sarit.indology.info/newphilo/navigate.pl?indologica.11>  
  
The Devanagari text is at  
<http://sarit.indology.info/newphilo/navigate.pl?indologica.3>  
and Roman output at  
<http://sarit.indology.info/newphilo/navigate.pl?indologica.2>  
  
These are mentioned and reformatted at - <http://sarit.indology.info/newphilo/navigate.pl?indologica.11> - <http://sarit.indology.info/newphilo/navigate.pl?indologica.12> They must have been assembled to get searches and word counts calculated.

<http://sarit.indology.info/newphilo/search3t?dbname=indologica>  
and  
<https://github.com/paddymcall/SARIT>  
  
The site appears to be very well funded and managed by experts.  
  
  
FYI, the Adiparva has 260 adhyaayas and BORI has 225 although as a critical edition!  
  
  
2) The corresponding scanned books in 17 volumes (numbered 9002 through 9018 for 1-18 with volume number 4 missing) are at Archaeological Survey of India

searchable at <http://asi.nic.in/asi_ca_lib.asp>  
or conveniently linked from  
<http://www.mahabharata-resources.org/>  
They are very large in size (The first Adiparva is over 95Mb if you decide to download)  
  
  
3) The SARIT files are same as the [sa.wikisource.org](http://sa.wikisource.org)  
The numbers were repositioned.  
  
  
4) There are Gitapress 6 volume books with Hindi translation are at  
<https://archive.org/search.php?query=creator%3A%22Ramanarayanadatta+astri%22>  
  
5) The vedicreserve site dedicated to Maharshi Mahesh Yogi has 18 parvas in individual files  
<http://is1.mum.edu/vedicreserve/itihas.htm>  
  
6) Digital library of India large number of editions . Search <http://202.41.82.144/>  
with title mahabahrat to get 828 books in different languages  
  
  
Nandu  
  
PS: Harindranath, please add all the above links in <http://www.mahabharata-resources.org/>  
and correct the 17 volumes set to 1-18 parvas with 4th missing.
