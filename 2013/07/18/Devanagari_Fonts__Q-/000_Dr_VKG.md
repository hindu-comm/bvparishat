Dear Marcis

After reading the spirited discussion about look and feel of pubIishing practices, would like to share my experience about font, ligature design and publishing.

The line gap depends on the type of the book. If the book is for reference purpose only, the gap can be medium. Considering the bigger size, it would be easier for a reader with the look and feel. But for regular reading, larger font and more linear gaps, would make the reader comfortable.

I do agree that some of the older books are hard to decipher.

But at that time of pre independence, their limited resources had one top priority. Stop the decay of palm leaf based texts and preserve, spread the wealth of information. Hence any comment with negative shade will naturally draw a hard and harsh response at large.

Now we are comparitively better placed in terms of affordability and choice of media. These days we need not print a book at first place, as I read your composition and mail without the need of the printed book.

Hence I recommend you to go by the suggestion of the author to have bigger line gap and larger fonts, as thd society is moving towards e reader model. Sanskrit readers are no exception.

With Warm Regards
