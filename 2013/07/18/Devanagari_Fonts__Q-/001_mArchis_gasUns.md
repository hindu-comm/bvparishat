Dear Dr.Ghanapaathi,

  

 Thank you for your attention to my humble attempt to make a small revolution in the Sanskrit type market.

I disagree. It the font is 15 pt, the gap of 20 is enough. If it's a Rgvedic hymn, maybe even 22-24, but not more.

By bigger size you mean 13, 15 or 18?

Again, what is large, can you be a bit more specific, please.

And some are much better than the ones printed nowadays. Actually the older are better, the worst are middle of XIX century printed in India, I guess.

Yes, that's a good argument. But you don't print 50 times per year Kalidasa for preservation. So if you do print a work of Kalidasa - it should delight the eye as well.

Yes, harsh we can be both ways. What I only want is to make it better. To get back to the lost roots. Even if I'l be damned and cursed.

Are we better placed? We have more freedom, but not enough knowledge and feeling of how it should be.

Actually I disagree with the e-reader model. I don't care if there is an iPod or none. I want to make books that will last even when the whole world goes down. But I understand that the Laws of Hamurappi will last longer. I want to make books which would be a specimen for others. Including India. But Indians seem to be proud of what grandfather's once did, so they do not have to do it anymore. Oh, really? I'm on your side. But I lack details.

There are a few font designers in India which understand what I speak about. And a few more MA thesis in the University of Reading. But why do the readers accept everything just as is, not even asking if it might change? Why are we happy with how Motilal makes reprints? They do not have the taste for making books. And yes - they can make them cheap. But what on Earth has Sanskrit to do with cheapness? I repeat once more - it does not cost nothing to abandon Times New Roman.
