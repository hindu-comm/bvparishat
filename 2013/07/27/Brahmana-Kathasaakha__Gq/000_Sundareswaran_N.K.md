Dear Scholars,

       Recently I have been pondering over( the scope, possibility and feasibility of)tracing the origin and formation of Upanishad-s texts as an individual genre of texts/as a part of the Brahmanagranth-s. Definitely savants in the field might have trodden the path. Can anybody please guide me for literature in these lines?

  

      Is there any Brahmana text available in print ( or in the manuscript form) for the कठशाखा ?

Kindly let me know.

With PRANAMS,

NKS
