A compilation of available material of Kathaka Brahmana was brought out by Suryakanta in 1943. The first few pages are attached. Maharshi Mahesh yogi University web site has a Kathaka Brhamana text. A Ph.D thesis is available from Harvard on this topic. AFAIK this is the only Vedic text which knows the planets unambiguously and has Graheshti that is offerings to the Nine Grahas with their names and mantras.
