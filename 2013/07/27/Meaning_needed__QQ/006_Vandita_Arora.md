Dear Scholars,



May I submit

 मितद्रु'---------- if interpreted on the lines of yaska's etymologicalmethodology , which is a



must to fully comprehend the multy-level meaning of vedas-------------------can on the basis of the



grammatical formation quoted by the learned scholars indicates मित=परिमित=नपा तुला i.e a well

-balanced personality who isधीर and does not waver or falter in life . the horse as well as samudra stands for such synthesis of strength and forbearance that stands a person in good stead.
