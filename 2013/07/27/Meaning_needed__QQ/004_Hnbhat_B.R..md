Both Acharya's have explained the meaning of the word मितद्रु and what more you are looking for?

  

The word is derived with Unadi also as per:

  

1-34 हरिमितयोर्द्रुव: ॥ द्रु गतौ अस्मात् हरिमितयोरुपपदयो: कु: स च डित् । हरिभिर्द्रूयते हरिद्रुर्वृक्ष: । मितं द्रवति मितद्रु: समुद्र: ।

  

and it can be used as an adjective with any word as explained by Ramanujam. So what more are you looking for? You can refer to any Vedic Dictionary especially this one:
