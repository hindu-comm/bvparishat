Dear Bhattacharya,

  

It is not the Edition he wants which is available online from scanned books, but he wants it in Unicode format:

> Kindly note that I need this in Unicode format.

  

as per his special note to his message. Hence all the replies are out of focus of his request. I too have the Edition you have mentioned and also the Edition of Balamanorama Press, Mylapur which list Vartika-s those in Siddhantakaumudi, only and not all in Mahabhashya.

  

Let us hope somebody may provide help to him.
