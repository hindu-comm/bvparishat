Subject:  
Respected Scholars, I am doing my Major Research Project of U.G.C. My topic is "Re-interpretation of Vatsyayana's Kamasutras in the backdrop of HIV inflicted societies and the efforts of the governments and educationists to impart sexual education to the younger generation with a special reference to the students' community". Now I am depending only upon the Jayamangala commentary of Yashodhara Indrapada for my study of the Kamasutras of sage Vatsyayana. Will you tell me the availability of the other commentaries upon the Kamasutras? Not only this,I invite all the suggestions or opinions either about my topic or my Research

Regards
