Prof.Joshi was a great scholar who was acclaimed all over the world for his profound knwledge .I remember my first meeting with him way back in 1982 at Nagpur and how I was instantly impressed by his personality.. 
There is no substitute for people like him. He was keen to keep up the high standards of research in Indological studies . The most befitting tribute to his memory will be to retrieve the lost traditions for which he stood steadfast.May his soul rest in peace!
