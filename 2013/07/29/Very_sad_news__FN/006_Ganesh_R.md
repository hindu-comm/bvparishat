Dear all,  
  

Prof. S D Joshi ji's sad demise has thrown the Sanskrit learning lore in to the deeps of poverty and pain. I feel proud to say that me along with a team of Sanskrit Scholars cum actors were invited by him to stage his Sanskrit adaptation of Hamlet at the Oriental Conference held in Pune in 1993. For a fortnight we enjoyed his learned company and rich hospitality. His version of Hamlet, ChandrasEnaH (co-authored with Sri Vighana Hari dEv.)  

is a standing testimony of his creative genius. The play is perhaps the finest example of idiomatic Sanskrit in the modern world. It's natural and lucid prose is a land mark in Sanskrit writing and reminds the best of in our classical tradition. I wish he had more time for such creations.
