It's really a sad news. Prof.joshi was a great scholar of modern times. His contributions include not only the works on ashtafhyayi n other works of paninian system, but also many prominent scholars like prof. jha n prof. bhate and so on and the institutions like cass, puna.

  

The fraternity of BVP offers final tributes to the departed scholar.  
  
With warm regards,

  

Shrinivasa Varakhedi Ph.D
