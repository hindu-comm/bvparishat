No. Exactly it is stated as

  

  

1-2.योगश्चित्तवृत्तिनिरोधः ॥ २ ॥ and not वृद्धिनिरोध.  

  

Both are different.

In that this much is correct. It is one of the eight Anga-s, and not any specific Asana, but it is defined as the convenient posture to concentrate for long time.

  

2.46 स्थिरसुखमासनम् sthira-sukham-āsanam One's posture should be steady and comfortable.  

तद्यथा पद्मासनम्, वीरासनं, भद्रासनं, स्वस्तिकं, दण्डासनं, सोपाश्रयं, पर्यङ्कं, क्रौञ्चनिषदनं, हस्तिनिषदनमुष्ट्रनिषदनं, समसंस्थानम्, स्थिरसुखं यथासुखं चेत्येवमादीनि ॥४६॥  

  

Any of the postures convenient can be accepted. But it is not with a view of therapy included in it.

  

This is what I understand of Yoga as a Darshana. There may be relevant sections in Caraka, Vagbhata, emphasizing on the psycho-physical advantages, but not in Patanjali's Yogashastra as

a Darshana, and has its own Kaivalya, is defined in clear terms. which is different in concept from other /Darshana-s and what we commonly call Moksha.

  

4.34 पुरुषार्थशून्यानां गुणानां प्रतिप्रसवः कैवल्यं, स्वरूपप्रतिष्ठा वा चितिशक्तिरिति  

  

this has been discussed in our group some time ago:
