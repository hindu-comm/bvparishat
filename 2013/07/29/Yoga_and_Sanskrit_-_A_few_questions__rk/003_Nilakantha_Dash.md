Dear Mr Jayaraman

you are correct. There are some attempts to have research level organisations on Yoga. There are some. But as you said, sanskrit knowledge is not available to all, or is not encouraged.

In great SabhA people declare things in favour of Yoga through sanskrit. Practically it is not followed. Place, post and unique programmes may help in a long run

Whatever research or new simpler material is produced, that comes in some other language. Sanskrit should take the place.
