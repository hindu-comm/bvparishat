Dear Dr. Jayaraman!

After going through your detailed mail on Yoga and Sanskrit I thought this reply may be of some value in satisfying your queries.

**I. Present day Yoga:**

Quoting your statement *"**Yoga has been accepted and practiced as an effective complementary therapy for various ailments physiological and psychological, worldwide."* Here I have a few questions to ask:

1\. Does any of the existing Yoga institutions either at National Level or at International Level practicing or preaching or popularizing all the 8 Angas of Yoga? (To say - Yama, Niyama, Asana, Pranayama, Pratyahara, Dhyana, Dharana and Samadhi) or

2.Are they confined to only Asanas (which are of mere GYM value and curative worth) and Pranayama techniques which of course have some curative worth depending on the efficiency and knowledge of the instructors?

3\. If they are practicing and preaching Yama and Niyama what are the methods of practicing these two?

4\. How successful are these instructors in imparting the methods of practicing YAMAs and NIYAMAs to their students?

5\. Are these instructors teaching or imparting or preaching YOGA to their students? In this process do they teach for earning their bread or to help their students or disciples in attaining 'Moksha'? If it is not for Moksha can we call it Yoga?

**II. Sanskrit Scholars and Yoga:**

Another Quote from your mail : "Further rarely do we see great Sanskrit scholars or normal sanskritist even practicing and studying Yoga seriously." Again a few more question on this:

1\. In the process of giving this statement how many Sanskrit scholars are contacted?

2\. Does it mean that Sanskrit scholars do not have any knowledge of Yoga? or

3\. Don't they practice Yoga in their private life? or

4\. Should they give demo of their practice for public attestation?

As far as my knowledge is considered no single yoga teacher is sent back with dissatisfaction when approached the Sanskrit scholars seeking their help in understanding Sanskrit texts on Yoga. Even in my own circle there are a good number of Yoga Teachers who have been taking my help for the last several years.

  

**III. Diplomas and Degrees on YOGA in Sanskrit Universities:**

Another quote from your mail:

"As Vyakarana, Mimamasa, Vedanta and jyotisha are offered as specializations at various Sanskrit colleges and Sanskrit universities one does not find a shiromani, Vidvat, Acharya degree on yoga (I need to be corrected if there are any and the number of students studying there if provided, will also be helpful)"  

My answer for this question is: Please visit the official website of "RASHTRIYA SANSIKRIT VIDYAPEETHA, TIRUPATI" to learn about different courses on Yoga both at Graduate level and Post Graduate level being offered by the Vidyapeetha (a Sanskrit University in South India for your kind information).

Once my above questions are answered I confidently have a lot of content with me to share on this subject.

With Warm regards,

**Dr. Rani Sadasiva Murty**
