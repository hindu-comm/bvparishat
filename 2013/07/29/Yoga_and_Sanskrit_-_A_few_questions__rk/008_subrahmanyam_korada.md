नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

विद्वान् जयरामन् --

  

  

"Yoga has been accepted and practiced as an effective complementary therapy for various ailments physiological and psychological, worldwide. Scientific evidence on the efficacy of yoga in helping people manage and overcome various diseases and disorders are mounting"

  

-- It is unfortunate that people forget the actual tradition -

  

there are three kinds of दोषs - वाग्दोषाः , मनोदोषाः , कायदोषाः ।

  

Patanjali authored three works to obviate the three defects -- महाभाष्यम् , योगानुशासनम् and चरकसूत्रम् ।

  

  

The last one was available to Nagesa (he quotes in Manjusa) .

  

Bhartrhari in Brahmakanda of Vakyapadiyam says -

  

कायवाग्बुद्धिविषया ये मला समवस्थिताः ।

चिकित्सालक्षणाध्यात्मशास्त्रैस्तेषां विशुद्धयः ॥

  

योगेन चित्तस्य ... etc is also there.

  

य़ोगानुशासनम् is for cleansing the mind - चित्तशुद्धि , whereas चरकम्(आयुर्वेद) is for physical health .

  

सुश्रुत says both मनस् and शरीरम् are the अधिष्ठानम् for his वैद्यशास्त्रम् ।

  

So योगानुशासनम् is not meant for शारीरकारोग्यम् as claimed / taught by present day Yoga teachers .

  

But is it not a fact that people get rid of some दोषs by following a couple of eight Angas ?

  

Let us check the scenario - initially the English doctors did not give much importance to mind and always depended upon the constitution of the body and have been prescribing medicine with no पथ्यम् !

  

पथ्यस्य च गदार्तस्य किमौषधनिषेवणम् ?

  

अपथ्यस्य गदार्तस्य किमौषधनिषेवणम् ?

  

पथ्यम् = the food suitable to your constitution in terms of the three humors , viz. वात , पित्त and कफ । -

(आरोग्य - ) पथः अनपेतम् - पथ्यम् ( धर्मपथ्यर्थन्यायादनपेते - पाणिनिसूत्रम्) ।

  

Later they realized that it is the mind , in the first place , that plays an important role as far as the physical health is concerned .

  

They started prescribing ' too much'पथ्यम् also , ie the system is not balanced.

  

Finally , if the मनस् is controlled thru य़ोगाभ्यास , most of the diseases can be prevented .

In other words , thru योग one would get physical health as आनुषङ्गिकप्रयोजनम् ।

  

If mind is polluted there will be chain reaction not only in the body but even outside - air , water , foodstuffs etc. - everything is polluted .

  

The Yoga teachers also do not know the meanings of the terms of योगानुशासनम् -

  

युज = समाधौ (not युजिर् = योगे)

  

And they do not touch the more important Angas - यम , नियम ।

  

  

"Even in traditional Shastrasabhahas and Vakyartha sabhas discussion on yoga does not seem to have been accorded important place"

  

You are right .

  

Most of the scholars think that योगानुशासनम् discusses only योग ।

  

I often quote Sutras from Patanjali's work in Sabhas and during Vakyarthas --

  

what Panini says (बौद्धार्थ) - अर्थवदधातुरप्रत्ययः प्रातिपदिकम् for शशशृङ्गम् - is termed as वैकल्पिकज्ञानम् by Patanjali --

  

शब्दज्ञानानुपाती वस्तुशून्यो विकल्पः ( यो सू 1-9)

  

Similarly , we cannot teach 'वृद्धिरादैच्’ of Panini without quoting the योगसूत्रम् (3-17) -

  

शब्दार्थप्रत्ययानाम् इतरेतराध्यासात् सङ्करः तत्प्रविभागसंयमात् सर्वभूतरुतज्ञानम्

(this Sutram explains how to understand the languages of animals and birds - by a संयमी)

Second Adhyaya of Purvamimamsa also discusses भेद and अभेद between शब्द and अर्थ , but ज्ञानम् is also touched by योगानुशसनम् ।

  

धन्यो’स्मि
