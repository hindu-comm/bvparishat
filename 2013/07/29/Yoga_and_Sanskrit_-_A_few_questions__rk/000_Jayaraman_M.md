Dear Scholars

  

Please spare some time to read this and give your valuable inputs regarding the following -

Yoga has been accepted and practiced as an effective complementary therapy for various ailments physiological and psychological, worldwide. Scientific evidence on the efficacy of yoga in helping people manage and overcome various diseases and disorders are mounting.

**Scenario - 1**

Most fundamental texts of yoga are in Sanskrit. There is rich unpublished Sanskrit literature on yoga in the form of Manuscripts.

But it is rare to find people with sound knowledge and training of Sanskrit in the field of Yoga. Though yoga practitioners worldwide have great regard and respect for Sanskrit scholars, today we find most teachers and preachers of yoga base their classes and sermons on interpretations and translations. I even have seen senior yoga practitioners and teachers regret their lack of Sanskrit knowledge.

**Scenario - 2**

Further rarely do we see great sanskrit scholars or normal sanskritist even practicing and studying Yoga seriously. Even in traditional Shastrasabhahas and Vakyartha sabhas discussion on yoga does not seem to have been accorded important place.

As Vyakarana, Mimamasa, Vedanta and jyotisha are offered as specializations at various Sanskrit colleges and Sanskrit universities one does not find a shiromani, Vidvat, Acharya degree on yoga (I need to be corrected if there are any and the number of students studying there if provided, will also be helpful).

Why is this so?

*This issue is raised not to blame anyone or lament the current situation. I ask with an intention to bring this issue to the notice of scholars and policy makers and also get clarity (for myself) so that something can be done (even at my personal level) to improve the situation. *
