Dear friends,  
  

There is a sort of perception among the beginners of the Hatha yoga practioe that the asnas are physically demanding and somewhat formidable. That is because initially the body requires time to develop the suppleness so necessary for the asanas. With practice the asnasa become comfortable and the aim "Sthiram sukham asnam" is achieved. The Padmasana is one of the most useful asanas for meditation and that is due to the fact that the distance between the extremities (i.e., the feet and the hands) from the heart (i.e., the blood-pumping station) is reduced in this posture. One who is hamiliar with hydraulics will see that the pumping effort of the heart is greatly reduced in this posture and the body remains at ease for long time in this posture. All these should be explained to a new practitioner. Further it is always preferable to introduce the practice of Hatha yoga at a younger age (say at the age of around 8 years).
