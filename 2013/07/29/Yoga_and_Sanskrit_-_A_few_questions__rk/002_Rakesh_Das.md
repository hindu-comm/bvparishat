I think this is a practical problem. Yoga as a Shastra is different  
from what we mean by the word Yoga nowadays. Yoga nowadays mainly  
fingers directly to Hatha-Yoga. That's why it has been developed as a  
therapy and many institutions irrespective of Sanskrit  
Institutions(RSVP tirupati, JRRSU, Jaipur etc.) or Yoga institutions  
or other institutions have started courses of Yoga therapy.  
  
Now coming to the Shastriya part of Yoga it does not help much to a  
person studying the Shastras, where Purva-paksha-khandanam plays a  
great role. Now, As Yoga itself does'nt preaches many fundamental  
philosophical theories. Whatever is preached there cannot be declined  
by arguments as those all are yogi-pratyakshas. In the way of Sadhana  
it may be needed, but such a person will not go to the  
Shastrartha-Sabhas. (I think Prof. Krishnamacharya himself (he  
shouldn't be introduced to you) hardly did Shatrarthas on Yoga).  
  
Hence, you will find the same situation with the subjects like  
Ramayana, Mahabharata, Puranas, Bhagavad-Gita etc. and surprisingly to  
Ayurveda also. They are hardly taught or argued over. But you will get  
Ramayana (partly) or Bhagavad-Gita in IIMs etc.  
  
Hence, the subject should have some practical implementations that  
will attract the scholars other than the Sadhakas. As a bunch of  
Scholars working in the field of NLP are now interested in Mimamsakas  
because it is helpful in analysing sentences etc. Now, we have to show  
some places of implementation (definitely there are some).  
  
And what is needed is to start some inter-disciplinary works involving  
two persons belonging to two different fields. For example, a  
Sanskritist may start work with a medical practitioner or a  
psychologist where Yogic philosophical thoughts are necessary. Then  
the Scholar or the student will have some interest over the subject.  
And then there may be separate courses in Sanskrit Universities where  
Yoga will be in the limelight. We can see that a lot of Sanskrit  
Departments in various Institutions have started courses on NLP where  
number of students is really surprising.  
  
So, I opine persons like you (holding such a position and being a  
Scholar in Sanskrit) can take initiative. It may take some time. But  
it is inevitable.  
  
We may also contact the scholars like Dr. JSRA Prasad (HCU, Hyderabad)  
who is doing such works and motivating his students to do Ph.D on this  
kind of subjects.  
  
Please, forgive me if I have told much or something inappropriate.  
What is written is my individual opinion.
