Namaste. Definitional exactitude is essential before one embarks on any kind of discussion on the subject. Yoga is a darsana like sankhya,nyaya etc. Its stated purpose is चित्त वृद्धि निरोध। Yoga in this sense is hardly a therapeutic tool.Are we talking about it?

Or about Asana, one of the eight angas of the yoga? This term (asana) is often used synonymously with yoga.Are we talking about it?
