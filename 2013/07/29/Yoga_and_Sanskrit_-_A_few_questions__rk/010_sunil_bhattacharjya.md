Namaste,  
  

Study of Yoga literature as well as Yogic practice are required. These days not many people go through the very ancient texts like the Darshana Upanishad and the other yoga upanishads. The Patanjala yoga sutra and its bhashyas are generally for Rjayoga and the Hathayogapradipika is read for the Hatha yoga. These are also other ancient texts namely Dattatreya-Yoga shastra, Yoga-Yajnavalkya, Shivasamhita and not so old texts such as the Goraksha shataka of Gorakhnath, a text by Matsyendranath and a few other texts, which are worth reading. The Shiva Samhita tells us that Raja yoga without Hatha yoga is not useful and similarly Hatha yoga without Raja yoga is not useful. It means that both Raja yoga and Hatha yoga are to be studied and practised.  
  

The knowledge as to why the Asana and then why the Paranayama, does help the yoga practitioner to begin the journey of Yoga.
