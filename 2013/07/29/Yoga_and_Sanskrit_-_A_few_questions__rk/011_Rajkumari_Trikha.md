Dear all,

Shri Jayaramanji has rightly observed that yoga gets lesser respondents in seminars etc and the sanskritists usually do not practise yoga. Yoga
teachers are not well-versed in sanskrit. I suggest keen yoga teachers to learn sanskrit through certificate course from sanskrit related institutions like Rashtriya sanskrit sansthan. But sanskritists can not be given any advice, as now-a-days nobody wants to do any physical hard work and yoga practices do require some physical labour. This tendency to shun physical labour has led to many social vices. That is why it is advisable to introduce yoga at school level to incorporate habit of physical labour in children.
