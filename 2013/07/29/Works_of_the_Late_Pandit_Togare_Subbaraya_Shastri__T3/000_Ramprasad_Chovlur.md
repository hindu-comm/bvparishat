Respected Scholars,



 I am collecting works of the late Pandit T. Subbaraya Shastri. of Anekal. Except the work Vimana Shastra , the other works are not known.Prominent among them are Prastana Trayee of Madhusudhan Saraswati and Amsubodhini of Maharishi Bharadwaja both published in 1931. A monthly started in the year 1911 to propagate ancient Indian sciences by his friend the Late B. Suryananarian Rao, founder editor of Astrological Magazine describes the Bha Mani Vimana , the sevent type of Vimana as described by Maharishi Bharadwaja . This vimana does not find a mention in the present published text of Vimana Shastra. I am looking for all the issues of Bhautik Kala Nidh (!911 - 12i and copies of Astrological Magazine for the period 1895 to 1914. I request scholars to help me locate copies of these magazines . I also request scholars to help me locate published,and unpublishedworks of Panditji.
