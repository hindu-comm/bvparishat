Dear Dr.DrVedantham Satya Srinivasa Ayyangar,

  

Can you explain why the fourth Pada quoted by you is different from the one quoted by Dr. Rani Sadasivamurthy and why it is different in making the sense different from the one popular reading as quoted earlier? I can't guess the Sanskrit word "Chaturdhat" and its meaning as quoted by yoiu. I have already explained the propriety of the reading of Sri Sadasivamurti already in my earlier post as quoted by him:

Now I am expecting your explanation on the reading provided by you and how the other could be wrong.

  

With regards
