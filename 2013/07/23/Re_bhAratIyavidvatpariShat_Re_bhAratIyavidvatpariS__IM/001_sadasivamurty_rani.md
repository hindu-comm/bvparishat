Dear Srinivasa Ayyanagar Mahodaya!

  
  
गुरुशुश्रूषया विद्या पुष्कलेन धनेन वा।  
अथवा विद्यया विद्या चतुर्थी नोपलभ्यते॥  

This is how I learnt this sloka in my childhood from my father. After seeing your mail I verified in the Subhashita Ratna Bhandagara. There also it is given in the same manner as I have given. The other variations of this sloka were also given by the other scholars. Particularly you may read the logical analysis supporting the reading "caturthi noplabhyate" given in the mail of Prof. HNBhat Ji.  
As you have given a variation I too have given a variation according to my own source. I don't have any disagreement with any of the views. I think I could explain you what my stand is in this connection.  
Regards,

**Dr. Rani Sadasiva Murty**
