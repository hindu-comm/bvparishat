Pranams to all learned members of BVParishat,  
As there have been many questions from many scholars about the forth coming seminar in the Rashtriya Sanskrit Vidyapeetha in connection with the 150th Birth Anniversary of Swami Vivekananda I furnish here some clarifying information for the convenience of all participating scholars.  
1. There is no registration fees to attend this seminar  
2. No TA shall be paid to the voluntarily participating scholars but local hospitality (inclusive of Lodging and boarding) shall be taken care of all participants during the three days of the seminar.  
3. Topic of the paper can be on any of the following six theme-areas:  

**First Session**: National and Global Outlook of Vivekananda

**Second Session**: Contribution of Vivekananda to Indian Culture

**Third Session**: Teachings of Ramakrishna and Vivekananda for Human Excellence

**Fourth Session**: Vivekanadaâ€™s Sadhana Marga in the Spiritual Renaissance in India

**Fifth Session**: The importance of Vedic and Classical Sanskrit Literature in the

 Teachings of Vivekananda

4. This is a UGC Sponsored National seminar in which many Swamijis of Ramakrishna Ashrams from many states of the country are requested to participate and arrangements are being made in this direction.  

5. Papers can be presented either in Sanskrit or in English

6. So far we have received a good number of Abstracts. Still, if any SCHOLARS AND UNIVERSITY LECTURERS would like to participate in this seminar they can send their full papers on or before 25th July 2013 even if they have not sent their abstracts.
