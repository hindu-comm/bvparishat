Pranaam Learned Scholars and Guruvars  
  
Can anyone tell me is there any group, site, book etc where I can get all the dohas, chaupais and shlokas on Hanuman Ji from Ramcharitmanas and Valmiki Ramayan?  
And if its in devanagri font with hindi translation then it will be very much helpful for me.  
  
regards
