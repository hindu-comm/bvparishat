Respected scholars,

Kindly help me with references that describe connection of devtas देवता with chhandas छंद in Vedas. I have also seen a table that claims to describe chhand and classical music ragas. Has any effort been made for recitation of Vedas corresponding to classical music ragas ?

With utmost regards,
