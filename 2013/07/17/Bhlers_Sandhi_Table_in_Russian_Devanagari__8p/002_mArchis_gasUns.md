Bad or small? You have transliteration, devanagari is just an ornament in this table. I can make it 120 as well, see attachment :)

I like your sense of humor. You are interesting to dispute with. Yes, instead of 11 it should use size 15. But that would blow the table twice as big so it should stay as it is. Size 11, 13 and 15 is all ok - 10 and 8 are bad, the rest is great. And readable, because crisp.
