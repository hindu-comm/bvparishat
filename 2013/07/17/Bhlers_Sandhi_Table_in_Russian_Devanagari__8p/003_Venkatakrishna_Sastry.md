Namaste  
  
How would the Sandhi ( or optionality Or Barring of Sandhi) be explained in the following case  
  
गुरू इति ? -- gurU iti ? The outcome representation- वि वी  
 in relation to the column of u ?  
गुरो एहि  - in relation to O table -row column ?  
  
There are more considerations in Sandhi marking and scripting than a row-column table approach . The suggestions for improvement is to consider the rule base, voice and illustration context.
