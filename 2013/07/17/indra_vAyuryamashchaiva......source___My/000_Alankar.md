I bow to the Gurus,

  

While going through a blog I got a shlok mentionedइन्द्र: वायुर्यमश्चैव नैरृतो मध्यमस्तथा ।ईशानश्च कुबेरश्च अग्निर्वरुण एव च ॥ It was mentioned in the blog that it is composed by Leelawati herself (Not Bhaskaracharya). Still Icouldn'ttrace the source of this shlok, not even in Leelawati.

  

Could anyone please help me find out the source.

  

Thanks,

Alankar
