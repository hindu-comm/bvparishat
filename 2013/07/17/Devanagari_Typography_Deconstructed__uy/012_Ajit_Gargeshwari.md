What font to use what quality of paper needs to be used and what the cost of a book needs to be are something that an author and publishers need to discuss. The historical and cultural reasons why a font and why a particular quality of paper was used has been discussed. The bottom line of Nityanand's view about the economics involved I agree.  
  

When the task of printing thousands of books still available only in manuscripts is yet to be done why should one really bother about reprinting Aptes dictionary. The money available to Sanskrit and Indological studies in general is small so let us make best use of the limited money and resources one has for very urgent and important issues which directly affect Sanskrit researchers in India an around the world.  
  

I appreciate though the efforts put bu Dr. Gasuns in trying to bring newer and better quality editions than better an updated dictionaries. I don't know if BVP would be the place to discuss more an in detail about printing.  
  

By this post i don't mean to disrespect any of the parties who are involved in this discussion Now let keep the focus back on issues scholars really face.

  

Thanks
