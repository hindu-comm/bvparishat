Nityanand,

  

 Have you seen Monier's Dictionary or Lanman's Reader? Even if you photocopy them 20 times, they will still remain clear. That's the matter of font - a good font does not cares what you do with it - it remains crisp. It's not about money. India could do it. But does she cares for it? And yes, I deal not with books but scans. And that is not the problem. Open Apte yourself, open Kale's printed editions - the print is so bad, that I wonder why it has had so many reprints, but was never re-typed. Devanagari books printed in Europe - yes, some may even cost $20 but can be Xeroxed and will still be readable. Apte's new editions are not readable from the beginning. And it costs nothing to fix that. It's a matter of ignorance.

 Do you agree?
