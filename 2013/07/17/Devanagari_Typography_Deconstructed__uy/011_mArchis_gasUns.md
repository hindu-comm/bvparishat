If there would not be the copyright issue, I would print myself<http://dsal.uchicago.edu/dictionaries/apte/>with a crisp font like Monier-Williams did. But as I donot know whom to pay and how much for the copyrights Apte will be in bad print forever, I guess. Oxford is the standard we should at least try to revive.

I attach samples of Varanasi printing from 2004.
