You mean books printed in India? That is news to me. I lived in India for 27 years. I must have been really lucky to have escaped those books.Maybe my past Karma was good. Or maybe I knew where to buy books from.  

  

How many publishers have you surveyed to make a blanket claim like this? Do you fit a curve based on one or two points? Have you ever seen quality of books printed by reputed publishers like Gita Press, Chaukhambha, etc? Have you seen the various sizes of fonts in which Gita Press publishes different books?

  

Regarding quality of paper, what do you expect when you can buy books for as low as INR 20 and INR 25 (\< 0.4 USD). You can buy Gita Press' Laghu Siddhanta Kaumudi in that amount. Did you expect glossy paper of coffee table books and Der Spiegel when you pay 0.4 USD? I do not know how much Springer Verlag would charge for that. 40 USD maybe? Price ratio? 1:100? Centum? Shatam? Hundert? Sto?

  

Guess what, as long as book is readable and paper lasts for 4-5 years, most people do not care. Which is why students from Europe when they come to exchange programs in India buy the Eastern Economy Editions by the dozens for all their friends. Since the books are much cheaper and affordable here.

  

Do not compare the rip-off publication industry in Europe to Sanskrit publishing in India which is still a noble cause and profit margins are hardly any.
