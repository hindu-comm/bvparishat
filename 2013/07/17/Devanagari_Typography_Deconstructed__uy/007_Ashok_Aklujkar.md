Without meaning disrespect to either party, I wish to say that I do not like the tone this discussion has assumed.

  

I suspect that a cultural divide and language problem have also played some part in taking the discussion to the direction it has.

  

To bring the discussion back to the main or starting point, let me say the following as one who has almost equal experience inside and outside India and who has taken his university's library from a single book in Nagari script to several thousand books in that script -- who has looked at practically all kinds of Sanskrit publications from India and other countries:

  

1\. The standard of Sanskrit printing was indeed deteriorating (in terms of clarity, paper used, attractive or reader-friendly page set-up, consistency in observing text presentation convention etc.)from about 1950s to the introduction of computer-based printing in the last decade or so. What the presses like Nirnaya Sagar and Vani-vilasa had achieved was generally lost. Now with computer-based printing there is a chance to recover the lost ground, but, unfortunately, the number of truly competent and dedicated Sanskritists has gone down. As in several other walks of life in India, the 'calataa hai / anything goes' attitude has asserted itself also in Sanskrit studies. In addition, the makers on educational policies have not realized that there is a national crisis in the humanities and its presence in a field like Sanskrit is going to be especially harmful; it is going to cause irreparable cultural damage, which will not be a good development for India or the rest of the world.

  

(Before anyone begins to throw bricks at me, let me clarify that I am aware of several excellent and dedicated Sanskritists in different parts of India. I also value the several new initiatives recently taken by such bodies as the Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan. The truly relevant questions are: Is the number sufficient for the cultural task ahead? Does it become -- is it a matter of credit to -- a country of more than one billion people having a long tradition of an enviably sophisticated and diverse intellectual culture? How many Sanskritists see beyond their own life times? Do they have fire in their bellies that is needed to change things around?)

  

2\. To see *objectively* where things are and where they should be in the matter at hand: Compare, FOR EXAMPLE, (a) the old Trivandrum Sanskrit Series editions and the editions done in the 1970s and later in the same series, (b) any Raghu-va.m;sa edition recently done by an Indian scholar or institution and theRaghu-va.m;saedition of the first six sargas with Vallabha-deva's commentary prepared by Professors Dominik Goodall and Harunaga Isaacson and published by the French Institute of Indology at Pondicherry, and (c) the Oxford reprints of Monier-Williams' dictionary and the Indian reprints of the same.

  

3\. If one is born with a lot of Sanskrit words already known (as I fortunately am and as most members of this discussion list are), using a later edition or reprint of Apte's Sanskrit-English dictionary does not present an immediately noticeable problem, but try to imagine what the experience of a person born in a culture not abounding in Sanskrit words would be. Such a person cannot, for example, intuitively figure out that the intended word form is dharma, not gharma. I have stopped recommending Apte to my beginning students for more than thirty years. I recommend Macdonell and Cappeller, although their Nagari font style is different from the one introduced in my \_Sanskrit: an Easy Introduction to an Enchanting Language\_. So, there is considerable truth in what Dr. Gasuns says, even if one were to find fault with the way he has expressed himself. 

  

(Incidentally, thelanguage blessed with the best practical dictionary of Sanskrit (best on the counts of judiciously chosen content, excellent paper and clear print), as far as I know, is the little known sister language of Spanish called Catalan: compiler: Dr.Oscar Pujol Riembau \["Pujol" is pronounced like "Puhol"\]; title: \_Diccionari Sanscrit-Catala\_; publication details:Barcelona: Enciclopedia Catalana.2005. I have suggested to Dr. Pujol that he should replace the explanations in Catalan with English explanations and publish an English version of his dictionary in order to serve the cause of Sanskrit on a wider scale.)

  

I have first-hand experience of how economic forces make it unavoidable for Sanskritists to live with poor quality paper and substandard presses. I am also aware that Indian printing standard as a whole is not bad. Still, the immediately relevant question for those on this list is, "Why Sanskrit printing in India is not at least as good as, say, English printing?"

  

Informed, systematic, sustained and self-critical introspection by Indian Sanskritists is the need of the hour. Sanskritists aware of ground realities, objective in their assessment, intelligent enough to find the precisely needed solutions and practicing karma-yoga will save Sanskrit, not repetitions of nationalistic generalizations or of platitudes received second-hand and third-hand.
