Namaste,

  

 Is there a book on devanagari typesetting? I know<http://www.flickr.com/photos/typeoff/3867470934/>**Naik, Bapurao S.**, *Typography of Devanagari, Volume One*. Bombay: Directorate of Languages (1971). But there is nothing about how an Indian printed book should look. What size of fonts, what spaces, which elements and where can one use, what are the best practices.

 So I took my ruler and looked at HOS, Nirnaya - the most authoritative text editions I could get. And what do I see. The gap between 2 lines of devanagari is 4 mm in a 15 pt font devanagari, that's what I see in Lanman. And Lanman's books, printed in Germany, are still the best out there. You know better than I what's the difference between books printed in India and books printed in Europe - Indian books are printed so often on bad paper with bad fonts so you have to break the eyes todeciphera ligature. It was so for the last 200 years.

 I'm working as an editor on a Sanskrit reader. The author insists on a 10 mm gap between nagari andtransliteratedtext. I would say 6 mm is more than enough. Please see the attached .pdf and write what do you think. I think a gap too big is no good gap, it's harder to understand what belongs to what.
