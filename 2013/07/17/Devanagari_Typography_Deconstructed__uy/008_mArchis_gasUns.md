Please understand I don't want to offend Indians. India would not be possible without them.

But more than Indians I love books made with love. What about Indian books made with love?

  

**Iyengar**, thank you so much for your technical details. Is there a book or an article about the history of the process you describe? I would love to hear more details, maybe a photo.

The debate seems to miss an important technical issue concerning how Sanskrit books were printed in India in the thirties to fifties to seventies.

Yes, I fully agree. Because all I know are some MA Thesis on this topic at Reading University in UK.



The font did matter for quality. This is not to do with 10 point, 12 point, antic etc. but how the letters were cast in the foundry.

How many point did you have? 8, 10, 12, 18 - how many actually? 1 style or several? Who cast them? Every foundry for itself or they where bought in Bombay?



Depending on the sharpness of the face and the mechanical strength of the types the faces got worn out.

This is understood, but how fast? What I see from Jataka-Mala (HOS 1) the book was published by Drugulin. And it's crystal crisp. I have studied the works of Drugulin and even wrote an article about his books in Russian. It's amazing what the Germans did with Oriental language fonts.



I am from a Sanskrit publishing house (not active any more).

How many years did it last? Where was it located?



I had to compose (or type set) manually and after the printing of the form (8 pages or 16) was over, the set matter had to be distributed back manually into the cases for the next composing cycle. Lead being a soft material it would get worn out quickly. Depending on the financial position the press had to get new letters cast.

For how many books / pages would it last? What was the price for a new set?



Hence from the same press difeerent books would look differently to the trained eye.

Yes, there is even some beauty in it. Because nowadays books look sterile :)



Note the publisher and the press were not always same except perhaps for Geeta press, Nirnayasagar and perhaps Venkateshwara steam press in Bombay.

That's interesting. Never heard about the Venkateshwara.



Now of course this way of printing (letter press) is obsolete! Sanskrit (Devanagari) composing needed justification (technical word known among printers and compositors of old times!). English did not need this. This was meant to account for the anusvaras and the lower level ligatures (u, U, R) marks. One had to use halfbody types with cut corners and adjust the lower marks such that the top hoizontal line remained really horizontal!

Could you please go in some more details? It's very interesting to read. That's exactly what I'm fighting in the Open Type features of the replica font used in the samples in the first post.



Hence I agree that the print quality whatever may be the paper was not uniform and varied over time. Added to this, low budget Sanskrit books were brought out on Treadle printers (Foot operated machines)

Treadle printers - never heard of them. Europe had some strong presses.



which could not give uniform force on the paper. I am not surprised if the scan quality of such books remains poor.

Yes, it's poor. What surprises me is poor press on grammar treatises. You just can't read or have to sit down and figure. It takes time. That's a waste of time. If it happens on every single page - you get tired.



Dear Prof.**Aklujkar**,

  

I'm glad to see you around.

The tone was not intented to be harsh. But it's not mild as well :)

No, only types and fonts, nothing else, I hope.

That's some fascinating experience and if there would be any chance to write it down in details I would be more than happy. But I guess it's interesting only for me.

The issue is in Europe it was lost after 1928, so even before (because the spreading of Linotype press in Germany and Russia). Up to 10 crisp Nagari books where printed until 1950, after that it was lost. Everything was lost.

Yes, yes, yes. That is what I mean. Once they were brilliant, afterwards it was lost and never it came back. Not yet. It has to be documented. It has to be explored in detail.

Yes, but only a chance. The PC by itself does not solve any issues. You get even more of them - Unicode is not fit for nagari, especially Vedic and Unicode is declining the changes that need to be made. So you have Unicode issues, Devanagari issues, InDesign issues -it's a whole new undocumented wild world. And if you don't follow a traditional way of printing a fine book - you make rubbish. Crisp rubbish. Rubbish on white paper. But it does not matters - it's rubbish.

Yes, that is what I have thought many times lately about. Around billion people, so devanagari is spread rather wide - but it's used as... slogans and that's all. You can't print a book that will make you want to cry from how nice looking it is. And it's not only about the fonts - the spacing, layout - it's not that easy. But there are good books we can look at from the past. Do we look at them enough?

I will have to track down theGoodall edition. But the examples you bring up are very important for me. That's what I mean - it costs us nothing to it right now, only knowledge. How long are we going to stay ignorant? Why do we ignore what we've learned from the past?

This one would be enough :) No, I like how the Indians have cropped the page size, but it's lost the readability.

I could remake your Book and it would look like Macdonell and Capeller. They have been printed with the Uenger type which was developed in Berlin and since 2005 I've spent months exploring it, documenting, scanning - to show the world what a beauty we have lost. InEdinburgh, United Kingdom, in July 2006 I wanted to make a paper about the history of Nagari types in Europe.But it was declined for the 13th World Sanskrit Conference. So I made a paper about dhatus. But to print the dhatus (as they should be) there is only one font available as for now, one font that shows all the anubandhas right. It was made my a colleague of mine from Belarus (so a non-Indian). It has more ligatures than the previous Indian fonts for Hindi taken together. So why do people outside India care for the script more than people inside India? That's my question, but there might not be no simple answer.

I did not want to sound harsh. But since 2002 I've spent so much time on the font issue not because I love it, but because there is so much to do that you can not even print a book using Indian fonts. There are some proprietary nicely bundled fonts, but they are not public.

He's working on a Spanish edition, so I guess English will have to wait. I do hope he'll consider my dictionary critique, as I've spent years in looking for different dhatus in different dictionaries. It has many typographical issues as well - but they are totally of a different nature.

And what does it costs to be such these days? Nothing. It costs the same. But the knowledge is lost.

Karma-yoga - yes, you can name it so. I call it the font hell. I want to get out of it. I'm tired of it. Let's get out of it. Let's write the story, so we don't have to come back to the basics again.
