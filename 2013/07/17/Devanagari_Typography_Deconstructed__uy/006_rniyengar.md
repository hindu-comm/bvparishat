The debate seems to miss an important technical issue concerning how Sanskrit books were printed in India in the thirties to fifties to seventies. The font did matter for quality. This is not to do with 10 point, 12 point, antic etc. but how the letters were cast in the foundry. Depending on the sharpness of the face and the mechanical strength of the types the faces got worn out. I am from a Sanskrit publishing house (not active any more). I had to compose (or type set) manually and after the printing of the form (8 pages or 16) was over, the set matter had to be distributed back manually into the cases for the next composing cycle. Lead being a soft material it would get worn out quickly. Depending on the financial position the press had to get new letters cast. Hence from the same press difeerent books would look differently to the trained eye. Note the publisher and the press were not always same except perhaps for Geeta press, Nirnayasagar and perhaps Venkateshwara steam press in Bombay. Now of course this way of printing (letter press) is obsolete! Sanskrit (Devanagari) composing needed justification (technical word known among printers and compositors of old times!). English did not need this. This was meant to account for the anusvaras and the lower level ligatures (u, U, R) marks. One had to use halfbody types with cut corners and adjust the lower marks such that the top hoizontal line remained really horizontal! Hence I agree that the print quality whatever may be the paper was not uniform and varied over time. Added to this, low budget Sanskrit books were brought out on Treadle printers (Foot operated machines) which could not give uniform force on the paper. I am not surprised if the scan quality of such books remains poor.
