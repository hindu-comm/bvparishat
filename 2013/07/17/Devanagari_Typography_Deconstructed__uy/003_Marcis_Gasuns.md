Yes, India. Bombay, Calcutta.

I do not by Indian books. I scan them. Download them. Copy them. Most of the time I do not have the needed Indian book because it has been printed 100 years ago. So I see what becomes after Xerox. So karma does not matters, I guess. Living in India you can buy a lot of books. I saw that when I was in Delhi. But Russia is a bit different. You have to hunt for good books.

Around 20.

Yes, sure I do.

I thinkChaukhambha is one of the best after Nirnaya, and even they make misserable books sometimes. I do not speak about the editorialqualityor content. I speak only about how it's made. What book ofGita Press exactly are you speaking about, do you have a specimen of at least a single page?

In the old days various font sizes had different ligatures. I hope thye have it, have they? And no, I have not seen, I guess.

The paper actually is mostly fine, and I agree - prices are low.

And I never will. Because you can not use such a book. I have an IndianLaghu Siddhanta Kaumudi, a Nirnaya one - a fine book. But not for INR 25.

40 - maybe. And I do not speak about glossy paper, you understand me perfectly.

I do not speak about the book industry in general or price of college books in US. I speak about the typographical level of Sanskrit works printed in India.

When you deal with Sanskrit there is no profit. But not having any profit does not gives us the right to use bad fonts these days. Because fonts cost nothing or next to nothing, but a book can last a few hundred years. I only want to say you can make the same low price great book look even better, become readable.

Any how this much I know, I have books from Vani Vilas Press, Nirnayasagar press, Balamanorama press which are more than a hundred years old and they are still readable and pages are not brittle and fonts are excellent.

Attached aBalamanorama book - if it's fine with you than I can say - it's not the same with me.

And yes I do have fine books from India - but they are reprints of older books most of the time.
