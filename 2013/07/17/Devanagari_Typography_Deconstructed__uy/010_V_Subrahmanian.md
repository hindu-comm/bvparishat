I share the opinion expressed on the Apte dictionary. The Sanskrit-English one has several pages where it is almost a challenge to locate the words and read the meanings. The student's English-Sanskrit, of year 2002, is no better. The fonts and the inking are bad. Paper too is a casualty. Compare this with the Concise Oxford English Dictionary, a copy of which, over a 100 years old, with me, where the paper, the fonts and the print are so nice. Even the lines in smaller-than-the-normal-sized fonts are readable with great clarity.
