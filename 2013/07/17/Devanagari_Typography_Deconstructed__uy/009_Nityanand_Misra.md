Dr Aklujkar,

  

I am sorry for the tone this discussion acquired, but the judgmental words in the initial post belied a complete lack of understanding of a different country, and the poster then completely redacted his "bad paper" remarks when the economics were brought up.

  

Anyway my final comments on this thread.

  

I volunteer for an Ashram that publishes many Samskrita and Hindi books. We work in a no-profit no-loss model. Our books are priced just enough to recover publication costs and storage costs. We do not even have money to publish, we have to find a donor (most often a Dharmic Marwari/Gujarati/Agarwal businessman helps us) to finance it. We distribute books for as low as INR 10, INR 15 and INR 20. We published 1,100 copies of a book in 2000 with more than 1,000 full-size (similar to A4) pages in black and white and 72 plates in high-quality colour photographs. The book was priced at INR 250, to recover the printing cost, payment to editors, storage costs. All copies of the book were sold out shortly, but had we priced higher, it would have been out of reach for most of our target readers. A scholar translated the book in English and printed the same with an English publisher. Roughly same number of pages in English, same number of high-quality plates in colour and even the proofreading was not done well. The book was priced at Rs. 5000!! Same book at 20 times the price(somebody must have got rich in the process). Still I think most of our books have good fonts and are easily readable.

  

I have studied the modern day end-to-end supply chain price dynamics of Samskrita and Hindi books in Uttar Pradesh. This is an area where most books are sold below INR 100 and many even at INR 30 and INR 20, and Gita Press booklets at even INR 5 and INR 2. Guess what the publisher gets? Out of 100 Rupees spent in buying a book, around 40 goes to distributor/retailer, around 40-50 towards paper/typesetting/composing/printing/transport/royalty, we are looking at best INR 10-20 for the poor publisher. If the publisher could afford to price books at twenty times, the printing quality would definitely be much better.

  

At the end of the day, it is microeconomics at work. Demand drives the fair price. Price constrains product quality.

  

Still I think the biggest publishers in this area today - Gita Press, Motilal Banarsidass, Chaukhambha, have had good quality fonts for quite some time.

  

Is this is not a good font -<http://www.gitapress.org/BOOKS/GITA/18/18_Gita.pdf>- then I do not know what a good font is.

  

Now if the westerners find problems reading scans of photocopies of low-price books, why are the Indian publishers to blame?
