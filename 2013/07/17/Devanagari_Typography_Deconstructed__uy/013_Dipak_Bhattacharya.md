About reprinting old books like Apte’s & MMW’s Skt-Eng dictionaries it seems that we are missing the most desirable action in this regard that requires help from the Government. The said dictionaries were composed in the 19^(th) century. Often they do not satisfy the needs of advanced research. I have to take recourse to various measures like consulting Wackernagel-Debrunner(1895, 1930, 1954, 1955) through Hauschild’s Register, Mayrhofer’s Etymologisches Worterbuch and indexed studies like those by Louis Renou, Karl Hoffmann etc. But most of the observations made by these 20^(th) century scholars will be found in the Deccan College Etymological Dictionary. This dictionary is most up to date and at the same time the price is prohibitive. Can we think of a cheap hardcopy edition and/or an easily accessible online version of this great dictionary? This can be made feasible with government help or as in the 19^(th) century of the Śabdakalpadruma, with generous donation from individual patrons of learning. The difficulty is that Radhakanta Debs will not be born again. Patrons of learning do not fund dictionary publication. Only the government can be of help.
