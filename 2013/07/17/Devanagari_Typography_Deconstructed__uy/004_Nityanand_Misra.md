In a single paragraph you say "you do not have the needed Indian book" and "in India you can buy books easily whereas in Russia you need to hunt" and yet again "Karma does not matter". Self contradiction.

Please list them and enlighten us what you mean by "bad font". What is bad for you is good for somebody else. Probably you are a bad reader when it comes to Nagari in books printed in India.

Great, then you cannot understand non-linearity.

What do you mean by "miserable book"? I have been using Chaukhambha books for years without any complaint at all. You can check Gita Press website for some sample GP books. When whole of India has no problem with it, I do not know why one Russian's opinion even matters.

I do not understand why you need a different ligature for a different size?

You earlier said "bad paper", now you say "mostly fine". Make up your mind first.

I have been using it for years. No problem at all. Maybe "you" cannot use the book for some reason, I can very well use it.

40 USD or price ratio of 40? Whatever, if you know the price ratio, stop complaining about quality of paper. If you do not understand economics, not our problem. Pay more, get more.

I do not understand your problem to begin with. I do not know which ISO standard of "typographical level" you want us to conform to. Guess what, even if you do, publishers do not care and readers like me (majority of Sanskrit readers in India) also do not care. Please start your own press and print books with high typographical level which pleases you.

I never faced this problem of font in most publishers whose books I buy.

In all three examples, I would say the scan quality is bad, and maybe the scanned book is in bad condition, and you are blaming the font for it!! The same book scanned at higher resolution would be just fine. It is common sense that any old book when photocopied and then scanned at low resolution and then converted into black and white would be difficult to read. You are blaming the font when in fact it is the digitization which is bad!
