yes  
i agree this is very important issue. generally i wonder how people tolerate it. i am speaking of computer fonts used nowadays in newspapers are general public use. in jaipur people normally use devlyias a font that resembles krimis/worms. i hate it. devnagari is widespread in north but aesthetics of fonts is too bad. even now many people use shrilipi 960/962/964 etc. which i resented comparing them to nirnayasagara fonts.  
but i see no problem on letter press font used in books till early nintees. they are beautifull.Marcis may not agree with it.  
but for most of indians there is no problem in gita press laghukaumudi or apte's dictionary. but MW fonts as well as old calcutta fonts look like worms for me eventhough they may be sharp. loko bhinnaruchih. nirnayasagar is ultimate for me. i wonder why nobody creats unicode nirnayasagara fonts? but now we have sanskrit 2003 for unicode which almost looks like old nirnayasagara font. and certainly it is not my job to do it. if Marcis is able to do it, it is most welcome. dear marcis on behalf of one billion people i request you to replicate nirnayasagar fonts for both unicode and non unicode and freely disttribute. please do it rather than blaming bad aptes.

moreover most of indian pandits are worried about content and not fonts nor sharpness. whatever font you feed they will chew it.  
they used whatever local press was available for them. though they would welcome beautifull fonts that was not priority.

but it is totally unacceptable to blame us being "proud of our granpas works" . i request Marcis to use noble words.
