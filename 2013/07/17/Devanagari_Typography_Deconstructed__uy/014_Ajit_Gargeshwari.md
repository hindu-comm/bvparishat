The dictionaries published by the the Decann College under Sources of Indo Aryan Lexicography at least most of them under their series are available on DLI website. Probably with some funding or with the help of volunteers who would be interested after taking the necessary permissions from the copywriter holders one can create a comprehensive online searchable dictionary similar to the ones we have on MW, Apte etc. Scholars can also contribute the necessary amendments to the orginals published to make it comprehensive and up to date.  
  

That might be the practical way out considering the huge costs that would incurred if one were to reprint a hard copy of all reference dictionaries. A thought after reading Prof Bhattacharya's post.
