Namaste  
  
Sh. Rajnath Singh said yesterday that there are only 14,000 speakers of Sanskrit in India. The number he quoted is based on the 2001 census. But the [census statistics](http://censusindia.gov.in/Census_Data_2001/Census_Data_Online/Language/Statement1.htm) reported this number as "number of people reporting Sanskrit as their mother tongue". I find the statistic unreliable as a proxy for number of speakers.  
  
I think the number of people speaking/understanding Sanskrit would be much higher. Some statistics that lead me into believing this are  

-   The "Inventory of Sanskrit Scholars" published by Rashtriya Sanskrit
    Sansthan in 2011 lists 5,000 Sanskrit scholars in the country. While
    quite a few mentioned in the inventory are no more, but I still
    think at least 2000-3000 are still alive. If we have 3,000 people
    listed as scholars mostly with traditional degrees or modern
    education degrees including PhD, and assuming one in hundred people
    who can speak or understand Sanskrit is a scholar listed in the
    RSS's inventory, the number comes to around 2-3 lakh. -   Then, I know for a fact there have been 200-300 Mahakavyas composed
    in Sanskrit since independence. This is quite a prolific output for
    any language, for a Mahakavya is not an easy feat.The total
    Samskrita literature output is much more.  
-   Bipin Jha Ji said he has a list of 400 journals in Sanskrit. That is
    no small number either. -   Samskrita Bharati has hundreds, if not thousands, of volunteers and
    they hold conversation camps and classes every now and then.  

I do not know if the 2011 census statistics are out. But would like to know any sources on recent statistics on Sanskrit speakers (not people who report Sanskrit as a mother tongue in Census) and how that has changed recently. I would like to hear that the number has grown in the last ten years, given the setting up of many universities and efforts of various organizations.  

Even if it has not, I do not share the pessimism of Sh. Rajnath Singh. The number of people understanding quantum physics would be much smaller than 14,000. The reactors are still running.
