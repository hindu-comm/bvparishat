Namaste  
  
There are some forebodings too. I read in a recent article in the 'sambhAShana sandeshaH' of Aksharam, a body of 'samskrita bharati', bangalore, which reports that the Central Govt has initiated proceedings to stop teaching Sanskrit in the Kendriya Vidyalayas and are introducing other foreign languages like German and encouraging students to opt for these. The fate of Sanskrit teachers in these schools will become uncertain.
