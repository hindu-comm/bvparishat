Dear sir, I m very impressed with your arguments and almost I m agree with the points raised by u but so far as I know and have seen that the SPECIAL CENTRE FOR SANSKRIT STUDIES AT JNU IN NEW DELHI IS TRYING ITS BEST to make research concerning modern topics in other fields of education co-relating with sanskrit texts and PROS focus is on the relevence of the topic in modern age and I think other universities should follow the way of SCSS in JNU.NAMASKAR.................
