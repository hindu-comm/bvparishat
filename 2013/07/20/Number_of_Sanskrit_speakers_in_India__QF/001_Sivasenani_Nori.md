I believe one of the largest number of Samskrtiajnas is to be found in schools, data for which is readily available. In vast swathes of India, Sanskrit is the most common second language in schools so much so that for 80% of schools in states like UP, MP, Rajasthan etc., we can get data for



No of schools = N - data quality is pretty good

Sanskrit teachers per school = S - more difficult to determine, but still 1.5 or 2 should give a good first cut number and is useful in determining the range.

Number of Samskritajnas = N \* S



A more nuanced approach would be to find out the ratio of specific-subject-teachers to students, take data for school enrollments for each state, take a % of them as opting for Sanskrit and based on the specific-subject-teacher/student, estimate Sanskrit teachers.



Then we have some 18,000 degree colleges in India and about 500 universities. Differing fractions of these have Sanskrit departments and they have different strengths. (I heard that University of Pune has 33 teachers (Asst. Prof., Readers, Prof.s)in Sanskrit in two departments, but that should be one of the largest if not the largest group of Sanskrit Professors in a given place). Each Professor has upto 8 students being guided for Ph. D (M. Phil. is more or less on the way out), and most MA programmes have at least 60 students. The Sanskrit Universities, of course, have a different set of numbers.



Then there are the Oriental-language-students and students of Samskritkalasalas who even at degree level are very good.



Finally, language teachers need to be considered. One needed to do have enough knowledge of Sanskrit to study alankaraSaastra, for completing Telugu MA or its equivalent. Things are changing though, especially in distance-education. Most teachers of Telugu literature at University level have a sound knowledge of Sanskrit, though I am not sure about those who teach at school level. A similar situation might or might not obtain with other languages. The number of Samskritajnas in this category would be much more. Even if we take asmall fraction - say 10% or 15% -of langauge teachers in Indiaas knowing Sanskrit the number would be huge.



The number of Samskritajnas - who are qualified to teach, or are being trained at an advanced level - in the education system are more than a lakh, if not lakhs.



There is a huge archaka community. In AP alone, there are 66,000 temples, of which at least some 30,000 temples have archakas. A small fraction of them are very good at Sanskrit. In AP we havehundreds ofVedic scholars (much more if we include those who know moolam only and not kramapaaTha) for whom a basic knowledge of Sanskrit is required (for generating the kramapaaTha). Most of them and those who finished moolam have a good knowledge of Sanskrit. We can get only a rough indicator of Samskritajnas from this category, but still they are there.



Outside these groups, there are quite a few - like, say, Jairam Ramesh or the scientist Roddam Narasimha - who are very good; it is much more diffiicult to estimate this number.
