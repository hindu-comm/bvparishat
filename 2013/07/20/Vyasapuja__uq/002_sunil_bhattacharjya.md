Namaste,  
  
Usually the people in the Northern India follow the Nirnaya-sindhu and Dharma-sindhu whereas the people in the Southern India follow the Vaidyanatha Dikshitiyam. I understand that there are some differences in practice suggested in these two different sets of books.  
  
Secondly, to my knowledge, the Chaturmasa was originally meant to be observed for four months and hence the name "Chaturmasa" and the Chaturmasa starts from the Shayana-Ekadashi (i.e., the Ashadhi--Ekadashi). \[It is another matter that the four months of Chaturmasa have subsequently been compressed into four pakshas or fortnights and thus these days the Chaturmasa is observed for only two months.\] The purnima immediately after the Ashadhi Purnima is the Guru-purnima and Vyasa-puja is to be done on that purnima. That is in accord with the practice followed in the Shringeri and the Kamakoti maths.
