According to PV Kane, while Vyasapuja is generally done on Ashadhapurnima, "In Tamil country it is done on Jy. su. 15 (Mithuna)" (p420, Sec. I., Ch. XIII, Hist. of Dharmasastra Vol. V, Part-I, 3rd ed., 1994. BORI, Pune).

  

I was not aware of Vyasapuja being done on the 15th of Jyeshtha. I request those in the know, to confirm if that is indeed the case.

  

The pramanas quoted by Kane (for As. Pu.) are: Smritikaustubha (on Tithi and Samvatsara) 144-145 and Purusharthachintamani 284.
