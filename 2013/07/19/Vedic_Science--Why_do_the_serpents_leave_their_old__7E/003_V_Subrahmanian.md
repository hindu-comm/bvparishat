This could be a good source to know about snakes and shedding of its skin:  
  
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_scales>  
  
Moulting is repeated periodically throughout a snake's life. Before a moult, the snake stops eating and often hides or moves to a safe place. Just before shedding, the skin becomes dull and dry looking and the eyes become cloudy or blue-colored. The inner surface of the old outer skin liquefies. This causes the old outer skin to separate from the new inner skin. After a few days, the eyes clear and the snake "crawls" out of its old skin. The old skin breaks near the mouth and the snake wriggles out aided by rubbing against rough surfaces. In many cases the cast skin peels backward over the body from head to tail, in one piece like an old sock. A new, larger, and brighter layer of skin has formed underneath.^([\[7\]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_scales#cite_note-RSSlimy-7)[\[16\]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_scales#cite_note-GenSnakeInfo-16))  
  
  
In the Br.Up. there is a reference, a comparison, to the jnani giving up his body-identification and yet living just like a snake shedding its skin.  
  
तद्यथा अहिनिर्ल्वयनी वल्मीके मृता प्रत्यस्ता शयीत, एवमेवेदं शरीरं शेते ।  
अथायम् अशरीरो अमृतः प्राणो ब्रह्मैव तेज एव ॥ - बृहदारण्यकोपनिषत् ४-४-७  
  
यथा सर्पत्वक् वल्मीके मृता त्यक्ता पतति, एवमेव ज्ञानिनः शरीरमपि तूष्णीं पतति ।  
अथ अयम् अशरीर एव अमृत एव, प्राण एव, ब्रह्मैव एषः । तेज एव संवृत्तः ॥
