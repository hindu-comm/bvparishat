Thanks for the mail. But what do you mean by doha? Valmiki wrote shlokas not dohas. Krttivaasa wrote his Ramayana in padas.Do you mean all the versified praises of Hanuman in one collection? I do not know if anyone did such a thing. Moreover, Ramayana was written alsoin Bengali, Telugu, Tamil, Thai, Assamese etc. Why drop them if you want a comprehensive work? But, as far as I know,none collected the Hanumant stuties from all these woks in different languages.

Dear Dipak Ji  
Tulasi's Dohavali is not a collection of all dohas related to only Hanuman ji.  
Might be I am unable to explain my query.  
There were 2 great poets or saints who wrote on the life Ram where Hanuman ji is his bhakt.  
1st is Valmiki ji who had wrote Valmiki Ramayan in Samskrit.  
2nd is tulasidas ji who wrote ramcharitmanas in local languaghe through dohas, chaupais and also had used samskrit shlokas.  
  
I am asking the group that if some one knows any single book in which some author had collected all dohas, chaupais and shlokas from both the ramayan based on Hanuman ? If yes then can any one provide me that great book details.  
I too had expected that Hanuman ank must be containing all these details but to my utter surprise the ank is a collections of different articles on hanumanji, written by different saints.  
  
Kindly guide me if possible.  
  
Regards  
Ashish Sharma
