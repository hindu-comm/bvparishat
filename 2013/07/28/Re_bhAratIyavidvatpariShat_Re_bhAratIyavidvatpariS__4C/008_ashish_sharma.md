Sir  

I am sorry again as i am yet not able to convey my query.  

We have many gods in India. Hanuman is one of them and people worship them with full devotion. There are many devotees of hanumanji who had given their entire life for Hanuman Bhakti. Hence i just have asked a simple query that might be there is a bhakt/devotee who had collected all shlokas from the valmiki ramayan in which role of Hanuman is there. Similarly, same have been done from ramcharitmanas also. ( As ramcharitmanas is in local language and not in pure samskrit hence there will be an extract from couplets, chaupais and shlokas).  

If no one had done this then I have no option and have to read both granthas and extract the required data.  
  

regards  
  

Ashish
