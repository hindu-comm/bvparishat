Your question has already been answered -- No, there is no such comprehensive collection of the versified praises with Hanumant as the deity. The task would be enormous in view of the fact that such a collection will have to take into account not only the Valmiki Ramayana and the Manas but all other traditional Ramayanas written in Bengali, Telugu etc. .
