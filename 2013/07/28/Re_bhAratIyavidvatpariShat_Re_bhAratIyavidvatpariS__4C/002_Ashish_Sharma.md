Pranaam Deepak ji, Prasad ji, Learned Scholars and Guruvars  
  
I have already searched at Gitapress books and after that only posted my query in this forum. Now, after you have mentioned about 'Hauman ank', I have checked that copy also. In that book, many writers and saints have written about Hanuman ji but there is no collections of all dohas, chaupais and shlokas based on hanuman ji. Today morning, again I asked Gitapress publisher and they purely rejected my request as they have no separate collection on Hanuman Ji.  
  
Kindly guide me through other source or book in which I can get all details.
