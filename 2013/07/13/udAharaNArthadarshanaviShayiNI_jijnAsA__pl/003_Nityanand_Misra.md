It appears the belief existed even when Panchatantra was written  
  
कौशेयं कृमिजं सुवर्णमुपलाद्दूर्वाऽपि गोलोमतः  
पङ्कात्तामरसं शशाङ्क उदधेरिन्दीवरं गोमयात्।  
काष्ठादग्निरहेः फणादपि मणिर्गोपित्ततो रोचना  
प्राकाश्यं स्वगुणोदयेन गुणिनो गच्छन्ति किं जन्मना॥ (मित्रभेदः १०३)  
  
So the example to be seen in the context of traditional knowledge in the time of Patanjali (like मणि found in the hood of a snake), and not modern day scientific conventions.  
  
Or if you want, you may take it as निमित्तकारण by considering that cow's hair can be used as an organic fertilizer - a Google search told me that a patent exists for this :) - <http://ip.com/patfam/en/19655010>
