I refer the 1992 edition by Navrang Publishers, which was in seven volumes. They are all available on Digital Libary of India.

  

The 2008 reprint is in five volumes and is priced at INR 3500. In this edition, the Bhavakarma Prakriya is in the fifth volume.

Tinanta, Nijanta, Sannanta-Yannanta, Yanluvanta-Namadhatu, Bhavakarma
