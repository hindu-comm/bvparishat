Namaste  
  
In this news report I read about a 'Koha' software:  
  
<http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/a-treasure-trove-for-bibliophiles/article4951553.ece>  
  
//“We have digitised the library using Koha, an open source library management software. Its commercial equivalent costs around Rs. 15 lakh in the market. The advantage of the software is that you can locate any book in libraries across the world,” said R. Jawahar, former state committee member, who is in charge of the library.

The party also has plans to produce a Tamil version of the software. Its Hindi version is already available.//

Will any informed members pl, throw more light on the software, how it works and whether individuals can use it.
