My dear Nabanarayan,



I hope it is excellent with you and your family.



It was pleasing to hear of the downloading of the BORI Word-Index to Panini by Chitrao and Pathak. I have the book with me, purchased when at the Panjab University in early 1977, as far as I remember. The book might have been sent to me by Professor Dandekar, I do not exactly remember. However,I distinctly remember having received itwhile at the Institute more than 36 years ago. I had been tempted to have a copy for myself after seeing a well-preserved copy used by late Professor Visva Bandhu.



The problem is that after years of continuoususe my book is at presentin poor shape. Printed on poor quality paper every page has become brittle, some in the Gaṇapāṭha are missing too. Can I have thefavour that you kindlye-mailed the downloaded copy to me?



I could myself try with the DLI, but, then, DLI is often uncertain here because ofpoor network connection rendering the transaction absurdlyslow.



Among others, since you have shown your interest in AVP publication, I inform that I am with the Introduction,Vol. 4 at present.The draft of mycomparative analysis and observations on the two tṛca-kāṇḍas has been completed. A comparison of the two ekarcca kāṇḍas is on.



I think the comparison enables me to furnish scholars with a dependable account of the history of the two AV Saṃhitās from about the days of Yāska till around 9^(th) century CE when Jayanta Bhaṭṭa had to defend the Śrauta character of the AV. **I spoke of the negative role of the Manusaṃhitā in the Trayī paper. More detailed evidence of its role and the cause thereof with a picture of the historical background has been adduced in the draft.



I require the good wish of young scholars that the task could be duly completed. 



Best wishes

Sincerely

Dipakda
