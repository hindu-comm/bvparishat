Dear Scholars,

Namasthe.

I am glad to inform you that my book on 1st canto of****Māgha'sŚiśupālavadham****(with explanatory notes) got published.

The book is designed for those Sanskrit lovers, who want to learn Sanskrit Poetry through parsing method. This unique approach of assimilating poetry through parsing methodology is clearly demonstrated by considering the first canto ofMāgha'sŚiśupālavadham. This shall help learners to practice and understand structural, grammatical and literary virtues of this great poem.

  

I am confident that it will be a very effective methodology in imparting a very different dimension in understanding ancient Sanskrit poetry.

  

I request you to encourage me in promoting the book by recommending it for your universities, institutions, libraries etc., The book is available at:
