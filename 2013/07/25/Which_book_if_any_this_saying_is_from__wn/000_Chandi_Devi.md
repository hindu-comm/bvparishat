Respected and Learned Ones,

  

I have a question about a saying that I cannot find, but that I had marked 'AG', so I am assuming that it refers to either the Astavakra Samhita (Gita) or the Avadhoota Gita. However, in looking in both, (in the ones available to me) I cannot find it. Since I am planning to publish a book of my Spiritual Master's sayings from His Diaries, and this saying is in it, I am checking various books to make sure I don't publish anything that was not said directly from Him. However, since His Enlightenment was so profound, what he says is basically the same as what I have found in various Gita's, etc. It is all Advaita. Even so, I want to make sure it is not word for word.

  

The saying is: **"All things appear in you, disappear after some time, leaving you as you were before they appeared. You are an infinite source from where the movements arise, that you call "I" or "World". And when these movements cease to appear, either in this brief moment when one has left you and the next has not yet come to occupy the screen that is awareness, or in deep dreamless sleep, you do not cease to be, neither in the moment between two perceived movements, nor in deep sleep or after waking up, is there any thought or feeling that you have ceased to exist."**

  

If any of you can help and confirm or deny that this saying is from any Holy Book, I would deeply appreciate it. Thank you in advance.
