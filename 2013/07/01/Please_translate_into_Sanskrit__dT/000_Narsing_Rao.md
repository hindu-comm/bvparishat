Here is a sentence from the online edition of "The Economist" which I presume is targeted to the average English reader:

  

"Since his ill-advised return in March from self-imposed exile to contest elections, which he was subsequently banned from doing, Mr Musharraf has been waylaid by three private prosecution attempts, including one that concentrated on his alleged involvement in the killing of Benazir Bhutto, the former prime minister in 2007."

  

I will very much appreciate it if someone could produce a translation of this sentence in Sanskrit.

  

Thanks,

Narsing Rao
