Dear Sanskrit Scholars ans Sanskrit Readers,

It is a great pleasure for me to publish this issue of Vi-duu, Vidud-duutah, the E-Messenger, with sincere thanks to Professors Saroja Bhate and Ashok Aklujkar for making it a special one. I appreciate their timely submissions.

This issue is special because responses (in Sanskrit) to views on Sanskrit as a lingua franca are cordially invited. If these can be sent to me ([jayand...@sanskritassociation.org]() ; Cc: [so...@staff.uni-marburg.de]()) by the end of August, it is possible that both the response(s) and reply (or replies) could be published in the next issue(s) of Vi-duu.

  

With best wishes from a now cool and humid Kashi,

Jayendra

Secretary General, IASS.
