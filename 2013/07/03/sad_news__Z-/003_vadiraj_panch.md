Dear friends,

I am deeply distressed to learn about the sad demise of Professor Aralikati, the icon of great scholarship and simplicity. I had had the privilege of knowing him for the past several decades, in particular, after I joined Rashtriya Sanskrit Vidyapeeth, as its Chancellor, in 1998. Even though Professor Aralikati had retired and left the Vidyapeeth, by the time I joined, his imprint as a competent Shiksha Shastri teacher was deeply embedded in the Vidyapeetha academic circles.

He was in constant touch with me even during his post-retirement career, by sending to me, copies of many of his writings and informing me about his multifaceted achievements. It was a meaningful coincidence that myself and Professor Aralikati received the President's Certificate of Honour in Sanskrit, at the same function at Rashtrapati Bhavan in 2005 (even though my Award was announced in 2003).  
Professor Aralikatti was always full of enthusiasm and commitment to do some innovative activities in the field of Sanskrit. His writings on Shiksha Shastra -teaching methods, would remain as leading guides, for a long time to come, in the context of promoting Sanskrit Learning in the country.  
Lord Krishna has significantly propounded the eternal theory of the cycle of life and death.  
Jaatasya hi dhruvo Mrityuh Dhruvam Janma Mritasya cha\|  
Tasmadapariharye Arthe Na Twam Shochitum Arhasi\|  
Myself and all our Colleagues at Rashtriya Sanskrit Vidyapeeth and the entire Sanskrit Community would pray that the departed Soul would rest in peace.  
I feel that we should set up an Annual lecture programme in Memory of this great selfless teacher- Professor Aralikatti.  
Our Condolences to the bereaved Family.  
  

**Thanks and regards**

**Yours Sincerely**

Dear Prahlad,



Prof. Aralikatti sir was an epitome of simplicity. He was an inspiring teacher to many students of *shiksha-shastra,* who are now senior professors. Wemiss agreat teacher and human being, forever. तादृशानां पुनरावृत्तिर्माभूदिति काङ्क्षये ।
