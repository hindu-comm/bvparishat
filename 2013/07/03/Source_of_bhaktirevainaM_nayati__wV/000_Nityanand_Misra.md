Dear scholars  
  
Does anybody know the source of the following -  
  
भक्तिरेवैनं नयति भक्तिरेवैनं दर्शयति भक्तिवशः पुरुषो भक्तिरेव भूयसी ॥  
  
It is cited in विश्वनाथ चक्रवर्तिन्'s commentary on Bhagavad Gita 2-45, and probably also in Madhvacharya's Brahma Sutra Bhashya.  
  
An unreliable online source said it is to be traced to "मथरश्रुति" \[?\].  
  
Thanks, Nityanand
