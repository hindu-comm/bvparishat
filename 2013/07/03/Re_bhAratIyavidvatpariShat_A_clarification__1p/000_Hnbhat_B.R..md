Certainly not. But note it is explained by Unadi ---

Sorry for delayed reply. I had missed this. Whether you accept Unadi of Shakatayana or explain with Panini only is left to your choice. If you want strict etymology for any word, and stick to it, you can get any word split into stem and suffix with Unadi which is flexible. This is the view by the western scholar and Indian Grammarians too.
