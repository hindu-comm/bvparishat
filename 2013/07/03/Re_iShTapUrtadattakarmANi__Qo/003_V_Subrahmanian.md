In the shAnkara brahmasUtra bhAShyam we have the chAndogya mantra cited:  

  

अश्रुतत्वादिति चेन्*नेष्टादिकारिणां* प्रतीतेः । ब्रह्मसूत्र ३,१.६ ।

  

....कुतः इष्टादिकारिणां प्रतीतेः।

'अथ य इमे ग्राम इष्टापूर्ते दत्तमित्युपासते ते धूममभिसंभवन्ति' (छा. ५.१०.३)   
  
Here we see that the 'Adi' in the 'इष्टादिकारिणां' includes pUrtam and dattam karma. In the brahmasutra bhashya this compound word is very commonly used and from the above chandogya mantra we can take it that the three types of karma are referred together and when only two are referred as in the Kathopanishat mantra, the two are upalakshaNa for the third. There is a sutra by name 'अनिष्टादिकारिणामपि च श्रुतम्’ ३.१.१२ - २१ (an adhikaraNa consisting of 10 sutras) which discusses the path the jivas who have not performed these types of karmas take and the phalam they enjoy in different loka-s. Here too, in the bhashyam, just the compound word इष्टादिकारिणां' (is used to distinguish them from the jiva-s of this adhikaraNam) is found for which the explanation is already cited in the other sutra quoted by me at the beginning, with the chA.up. mantra.     
  
In the Chandogya shAnkara bhashyam for the above cited mantra we have:  
  
इष्टापूर्ते इष्टमग्निहोत्रादि वैदिकं कर्म, पूर्तं वापीकूपतडागारामादिकरणम् । दत्तं बहिर्वेदि यथाश्क्त्यर्हेभ्यो द्रव्यसंविभागो दत्तम् ।   
  
On a check in the sutra bhashya document I did not get the below cited verses. Nor are they cited in the above chAndogya bhAShyam too.  
  
In the Kathopanishat we have a mantra 1.1.8 where in the second half we see the words "...इष्टापूर्ते पुत्रपूंश्च सर्वान्..’ Here in the bhashyam we have: इष्टं यागजं पूर्तमारामादिक्रियाजं फलम् ।  
  
So, from the Chandogya mantra we find that the three types of karma-s are found together.
