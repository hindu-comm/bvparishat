It appears that शब्दकल्पद्रुमः has the wrong citation. वाचस्पत्यम् on दत्त meaning 6 says that the citation in शब्दकल्पद्रुमः is wrong (ascribing it to लिपिकरप्रमादपाठ). वाचस्पत्यम् says that the correct reading is "दत्तमित्यभिधीयते" (as in Govindananda's commentary) and not "दण्डमित्यभिधीयते" as cited in शब्दकल्पद्रुमः.

वाचस्पत्यम् also traces this to महाभारत शान्तिपर्व but the verse number is not given. Most likely it is मोक्षधर्मपर्व (as cited by शब्दकल्पद्रुमः) which forms chapters 173 to 375 of शान्तिपर्व. It may be very well possible that the three verses may be together in महाभारत.
