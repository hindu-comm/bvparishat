I think your question has been answered properly by the great scholar and philosopher:

  

शब्दार्थ-शासन-ज्ञान-मात्रेणैव न वेद्यते । वेद्यते स तु काव्यार्थ-तत्त्वज्ञैरेव केवलम् । । ध्व्क्\_१.७ । ।  

  

in the case of Literary texts. For others you can depend on own thinking and intellect or the commentators on the texts. If you do not believe in any of them, you are free to decide it from the context.

  

Of course I could not the context of your query specifically.
