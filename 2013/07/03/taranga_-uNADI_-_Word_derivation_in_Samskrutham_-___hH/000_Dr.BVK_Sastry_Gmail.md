Namaste



This is a serious issue and needs careful attention. This is responding to the note on uNAdi reading : \<. If you want strict etymology for any word, and stick to it, you can get any word split into stem and suffix with Unadi which is flexible. This is the view by the western scholar and Indian Grammarians too. \>. This kind of stand seriously affects research in Samskrutham, making any thing pass as uNAdi derivation.



The options of using the provision of uNAdi by Indian Shastra tradition using a sacred technical language model and western scholars following a PIE model –historic language are totally different models of working. The goal, the compliance with the technicalities of uNAdi rules itself and other related disciplines varies at large; and by personal fancy of the interpreter. uNAdi seems to be a convenient handy tool used by every one where convenient for oneself, where the interpretation is irksome to ones position, Or where one wants to deconstruct another school !



The rule is clear on how to make the choice: \< Whether you accept Unadi of Shakatayana or explain with Panini only is left to your choice \>. Panini for Vedanga Vyakarana. Shaaktaayana for Chandas. The applicable rule book is decided by the given text and context of occurrence and usage. This is the rule about the structural integrity of text and maintaining the continuity of tradition. If one violates
this, by invoking the ‘ uNADi’ like freedom, the ‘title’ Purusha-Sukta’ can end up as a gender biased revelation and making a demand to modify the text as ‘ Stree-Sukta’ ; and then align Shree-Sukta as female counter of Purusha Sukta. Surely the justification comes as \< If you want strict etymology for any word, and stick to it, you can get any word split into stem and suffix with Unadi which is flexible. This is the view by the western scholar and Indian Grammarians too. \> 



This is clearly the abuse of the provision called ‘bAhulakam’ understood as ‘Option, allowing an interpreters preferential choice’, and this to ‘over rule the structural integrity of text, the real original intention of Speaker (Satya vak –vaktuH abhiprAyah). Without understanding why and how the ‘Prakruti-split’ is done at the level of ‘Dhatu –uNAdi’, the fancy derivations and ‘vana-vikaruti / pada-vikara ’ issues are being brought in.



Here is a brief note, as I understand on the care to be taken in uNAdi rule invoking under ‘bAhulakaM’. 



1. Make sure the given word belongs to domain of Samskrutham:
To consider a given word as belonging to standards of ‘Samskrutham’ ( Sanskrit), there are specific rules. The primary rule is : One should be able to explain the word structure formation using (a) a split of word to Base + Affix + Process = Prakruti + Pratyaya + Process. (b) Connect a relevant rule for the explanation of each element Prakruti,Pratyaya,Prakriya.





2. Make sure about the meaning –guidance of each component of word:
The meaning part of the Base , affix and process come from different sources. The meaning of base comes from Kosha –Vyavahara, Nirukta . This meaning association has a specific context and tradition. The technicality of this meaning association in special disciplines follows the technicality of ‘Paribhashaa’.



3. Make sure about the paribahshaa applicable to the given case. Each technical discipline has its paribhashaa documented in relevant texts.



4. Be clear about the Chandas technicality of word, which makes the given word ‘ Darshana –Apaurusheya’ and therefore places it beyond the realm of correcting the form by rule-twisting. Unadai technicality is a super specialty explanation for words under Chandas (-Veda). Contemplate on uNAdi prescribing sutra using ‘bahulaM’ exactly the same way as ‘Chandasi bahulam’.



Downgrading the Vyakarana shastra technicality of ‘ bahulam’ for linguists convenience of ‘ Explaining social degenerative language’
and using technicality of Paninian ‘ Bhashaa’ rules ; ( and further sliding it down to Prakruta, Mlechha, Apabhramsha phases of language-slide down) is not correct.



5. In the given case below, and with the reference text given, the word ‘taranga’ generally understood as ‘ gently moving waves on water ’.



Now let us take the literary text line ‘taranga- bhroo-bahngaH’, ‘ tarala-taranga (from ganga stuti) . How do we arrive at the meaning of the word ‘taranga’ here ?



Do we go to get the above sentence meaning with substitution of the meanings like : shalabha ( moth), shAliprabheda ( a variety of grain), pakshi (Bird), Surya (Sun), bidAla (Cat) , pArada (Mercury – if in neuter gender ?) turaga (horse), vastra-bhanga (clothe fold ), OR any other meaning that the ‘ interpreter wants to derive by creative imagination = oohya ???





For contemplation by scholars please.

Regards

BVK Sastry

Respected scholars,  
  
There was a discussion in a list about  
etymology of तरङ्गः  
I presented the following -  
तरङ्गः - तृ + अङ्गच् \[तृ तरणे\]



Certainly not. But note it is explained by Unadi ---

Sorry for delayed reply. I had missed this. Whether you accept Unadi of Shakatayana or explain with Panini only is left to your choice. If you want strict etymology for any word, and stick to it, you can get any word split into stem and suffix with Unadi which is flexible. This is the view by the western scholar and Indian Grammarians too.
