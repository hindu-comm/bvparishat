Dear friends,  
  

The Jainas beliebe that their Adi Tirthankar Rishabhnath was the first to teach the number system and he taught that to his daughter Sundari. I believe that Sudari was writing with her left hand and that she wrote from right to left. That is probably the genesis of the rule "Ankaanaam Vaamato Gati". I shall be thankful if the scholars in this forum can throw more light on this.  
  

Regards,.
