Namaskarams to all,

  

  

The eminent scholar Dr.Mani Dravid SastriNaH has kindly consented to deliver lectures on the VedAnta paribhAShA (a seminal work that facilitates the proper understanding of the Advaita shAstra) in Hindi for the benefit of those who are familiar with that language. The Advaita Academy that is video-recording and web-casting the lectures has provided the following URLs for enabling interested persons to hear the lectures. The initial lectures are available here:

Those interested in following the lectures may kindly let me know through private email so that I can inform them via email the uploading of the classes as and when they become ready, since announcements of each upload is not permitted in this forum. As of now it is planned to record one class of one hour duration each week.
