# **This unique and very enlightening conference was held on March 29-31, 2013, at the Jawaharlal Nehru National Youth Centre, 219-Deen Dayal Upadhyay Marg, in New Delhi, India.

University, Baroda and Professor of life sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, India, gave the presidential address.

**Other scholars discussed the truths and reality of ancient Indian concepts of consciousness, cosmology, yoga, medicine, Ayurveda, and many other aspects that are only recently being researched by modern scientists. They also explored how these concepts can be applied or are otherwise relevant to modern society to solve many of its current problems. For example, **Denis Kleschev, from Russia gave a power-point presentation on “Vedic Wisdom and Structural Harmony of Systems”.** **Denis concluded that Harmony ("Dharma") supports coexistence of all objects in the Universe. So, mathematics of harmony allows passing to the quantitative description of the physical theories of David Bohm and Fritjof Capra.** **Other prominent speaker**s,** **Dr. S. Letchoumanane and Professor Vijay Gupta **gave a power-point presentation** on the applications of **Vrikshayaurveda (ancient science of plant life) and Simplified Kundalini Yoga to study their effects **to increase crop yields.
