Respected All,  
  
Namaste.  
  
This is with reference to an international conference organized by Dr.Paramamitra Shastry Charitable Trust, coordinated by Dr.Ramanath Pandey at New Delhi between 29-31 March '13.  
  
I participated in this conference along with some of our students from University of Hyderabad. I presented a paper titled 'Botanical Science in Sanskrit Literature - Exploring its Contemporary Relevance'. Findings of the paper were part of an ongoing project. The conference proceedings were well conducted. There was a good number of delegates from many places. There was a nice paper by a Russian delegate too.  
  
During the conference proceedings, I heard a chemistry professor saying, 'you say everything is in Vedas, but using Vedic knowledge, you could not even manufactured a cycle bell'!  
  
First of all, the scientists should be open to welcome positive ancient (whether Indian or other) theories. Questioning is good. But repeatedly questioning traditional knowledge may not enrich one's scientific vigor. Instead, thinking from an interdisciplinary perspective is always healthy.  
  
As per my observation, it seemed that scholars/experts in modern sciences does not appreciate some of the ancient theories/concepts that are scientific in nature (of course, I've reservations about using the word 'science' to denote '*shaastra*'). Whenever, there is an interdisciplinary thinking, in my opinion, we should know the fundamentals of respective modern science/scientific theories, try to correlate, then observe for any possible ancient theories which can benefit the core. In doing so, while we correlate, the scientist community may object that ancient Indians don't have any measuring equipment or they don't know this and that and so on so forth. Apparently those times are different and their materialistic requirements are very minimal. Hence, if we investigate their scientific progress in terms of modern measuring equipment like microscope, polygraph, mobile technology etc., it is a sheer waste of time (apologies if sounds hard). Ancient Indian's life style was balanced, they are contended, accordingly inventions followed.  
  
Dr.Pandey, being one man army, has tried his level best to maintain the quality of the conference. Hope, he may submit the report to the list soon.  
  
With regards,  
Prasad
