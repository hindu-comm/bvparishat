Dear BVP members,  
  
 I am trying to find readable information regarding the concept of Navyavyakarana to assign to students to read. I don't find any book in my library that contains the word navyavyakarana, nor do I find anything in the World Cat. Google search gives only lists of institutions that offer degrees in Navyavyakarana. I am aware that many Indian universities offer degrees in Navyavyakarana, but I have been unable to get hold of a degree syllabus online. I have most of the original texts and commentaries from authors like Bhattoji, Kaundabhatta, Nagesa etc., but I am looking for something that I can assign to students to read to give them an idea of the difference between Prachina and Navya Vyakarana. I would appreciate any suggestions from scholars. These students know basic Sanskrit, but are not at a level sufficient to read grammatical commentaries in original.  
 With best regards,
