I too endorse the view of Nityananda Mishra. Neither memorizing Ashtadhyayi nor SK rotten by heart will do any thing good, but only after digesting the systems individually and understanding the systems. The Bridge between the two systems of learning seems to be Nagesha Bhatta who wrote commentaries on both AS and SK and traditionally his words are considered as the final on Mahabhashya issues, by the followers of SK system.

  

One can easily list out many loopholes in the wide network of Mahabhashya as well as SK AND its commentaries and sub commentaries, which are a matter of concern for the traditional grammarians who can defend or offend anything with their intellectual supremacy. But criticizing any one of the systems seems not justified for learners or scholars trying to understand the difference of the systems.

  

It was Rupavatara, by a buddhist Dhrmakirti, to present the forms in the sections which equal to LS. And the commentatary Nyasa by Jindendra Buddhi, on Kashika on the other system, on Ashtadhyayi, also offers the prakriyA for the examples, given in Kashika much earlier than Prakriyakaumudi or rUpavatAra also probably. (I am not sure of the date). The point is a reconciliation of both systems after digesting the systems was on its way at the time of Jinendra Buddhi himself.

  

There is a discussion on this poing what is Vyakarana, Navya Vyakarana, I think starts from Kaundabhatta's Bhushanasara, abridgement of VaiyakaraNabhuShaNa, probably following the suit of VyutpattivAda of Gadadhara. I mean, the Navyanyaya style of Parishkara, and presentation of VaiyakaraNaBhuShaNa.
