Dear Shri. Sharadatanaya,  
  
 Thank you so much for this pdf (Siddhāntakaumudī-antyeṣṭi). I had not seen this work. Among the critiques of Bhaṭṭoji listed by this book, I have copies of the works of Jagannātha, Cakrapāṇi, Viśveśvara and Nāgeśa, but I have not seen Mauni Kṛṣṇa Bhaṭṭa's Manoramākhaṇḍana and Bhāskara Dīkṣita's Śabdakaustubhadūṣaṇa. Were these ever published? I would appreciate any information regarding these works.
The NCC lists a manuscript of Keśava's Manoramākhaṇḍana. I have seen critiques of Bhaṭṭoji Dīkṣita by several Mādhva scholars, but they seem to focus more on rejecting his Advaitic work Tattvakaustubha, rather than being critiques of the Siddhāntakaumudī or Prauḍhamanoramā. In any case, thanks for this book by Rajendranath Shastri.
