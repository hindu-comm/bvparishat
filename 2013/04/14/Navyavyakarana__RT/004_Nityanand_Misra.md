Thanks for the interesting work. A lot of insights, and a lot of laughing moments too.

  

I believe Siddhantakaumudi, when used as a stepping stone for Mahabhashya and/or as a reference, is useful. Though memorizing the SK is not useful, it is to be understood rather than memorized. In most traditions commentaries are to aid understanding and original texts are the ones which are memorized.

  

Not all SK and LSK teachers discourage from memorizing Ashtadhyayi. The brilliant commentary Sridharamukhollasini in Hindi by Govind Prasad Sharma on the LSK throughout focusses on memorizing the Sutra order of Ashyadhyayi and the forms (useful again in this age), but not on memorizing the commentary itself.

  

At several places in the book the criticism has gone hilariously overboard - the claim that nobody gave any importance to SK till Bhattoji locked up and physically bashed (मरम्मत being the term used) Jnanendra Saraswati and let him go only when he promised to compose a commentory (Tattvabodhini) is one such example of imagination running wild. :) Then being Arya Samajis, the authors have to assail Bhattoji for calling Pratyahara Sutras as Maheshwara Sutras.

  

Even if one believes in their criticism of the SK, the blame must go to the creator of Prakriya Kaumudi for being the first work which changed the order of Paninian Sutras and organizing them as Prakaranas (which is no small achievement in itself).
