Sir,

I have seen the list given by Professor Pandurangi. I failed to follow the criteria in labelling works as prācīna vyākaraṇa and navya vyākaraṇa, as some of the same texts are found repeated for the courses of bachelor degrees post degrees. There are discussions on the view points among the scholars; i.e. for instance, the rapratyahara is to be imagined on not on the basis of the sixth Mahesvarasutra: laṇ, and there are the rapratyaharamaṇdanaand rapratyaharakhaṇdana (uphold & refute). Then for the support of each views the Mahabhashya comments are brought on to the picture, as the rules like: उरण्रपरः, अतो ल्रान्तस्य etc. As I had raised a question on रप्रत्याहारप्रयोजनम् three years ago, and Professor H N Bhat had replied on that. Here is the link:

Here we see navyas and pracinas comment differently on the same issue.  

I feel that the difference of opinion on the issue of "what really Panini had intended", and the debate on different view points as the new ideologists and the traditional ideologists.  

So, as Professor Jha requested, we have classify the authors as new ideologists and the traditional ideologists.

Regards,

Narayanan
