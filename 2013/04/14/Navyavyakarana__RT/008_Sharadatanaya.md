Sri Charudeva Sastry opposes Bhattoji in many cases, for instance his  
order of sutras in sanhita prakarana is not effective.

no need to blame prakriyasarvasa because until that nobody was stopped  
the method of astdhyayi learning.

Venimadhavasukla (author of praiskara darpana) also critisizes  
bhattoji in some place in his kaumudikalpalathika (being commentary to  
it)

\> Sir,  

\> I have seen the list given by Professor Pandurangi. I failed to follow the criteria in labelling works as prācīna vyākaraṇa and navya vyākaraṇa, as some of the same texts are found repeated for the courses of bachelor degrees post degrees. There are discussions on the view points among the scholars; i.e. for instance, the rapratyahara is to be imagined on not on the basis of the sixth Mahesvarasutra: laṇ, and there are the rapratyaharamaṇdanaand rapratyaharakhaṇdana(uphold & refute). Then for the support of each views the Mahabhashya comments are brought on to the picture, as the rules like: उरण्रपरः, अतो ल्रान्तस्य etc. As I had raised a question on रप्रत्याहारप्रयोजनम् three years ago, and Professor H N Bhat had replied on that.

I don't find any book in my library that contains the word navyavyakarana, nor do I find anything in the World Cat. Google search gives only lists of institutions that offer degrees in Navyavyakarana. I am aware that many Indian universities offer degrees in Navyavyakarana, but I have been unable to get hold of a degree syllabus online. I have most of the original texts and commentaries from authors like Bhattoji, Kaundabhatta, Nagesa etc., but I am looking for something that I can assign to students to read to give them an idea of the difference between Prachina and Navya Vyakarana. I would appreciate any suggestions from scholars. These students know basic Sanskrit, but are not at a level sufficient to read grammatical commentaries in original.
