Dears

  

Dr. Shiva Kumar Ojha has written excellent book in Hindi on Indian culture and thought. It is also translated into Kannada. He was working in IIT-B's Department of Aerospace till 1994. Recently he was here in our Vidyapeeth. As I have an info asked by him, I need his contact ph. or e-mail id. I searched for it in Internet in vein. Could someone somehow find it for me?

  

Thanking you
