I am sorry for the wrongly typed 'eight syllable quarter'. Please read seven syllable quarter as typed below.  
  

The intended words are *mā* (*niṣāda pratiṣhṭāṃ tvaṃ*) *gamaḥ śāśvatīḥ samāḥ… *‘Hunter! You shall not attain success over the aeons… ’ This prohibitive aorist (P.3.3.175 *māṅi luṅ*) gives a perfect sense. But *gamaḥ śāśvatīḥ samāḥ* makes a seven syllable quarter which is avoided by reading *agamaḥ* which Pāṇini 6.4.74 prohibits by *na māṅ yoge*. Vālmīki’s is an ārṣa usage.

An evidence that Kṣemendra had understood *agamaḥ* as ārṣa usage comes from his paraphrasing in the Rāmāyaṇamañjarī *mā niṣāda pratiṣṭhāṃ tvam ālabdhāḥ śāśvatīḥ samāḥ*.
