Being a Tamil-kannadiga, I would like to add some inputs. Tamilians (we) have two RAs, and three NA, and LAs.

  

ர – र ra

ற – ṟa

  

ண – ण ṇa

ந – न na

ன – ṉa

  

ல – ल la

ள – ळ ḻa

ழ – ĺa

  

In addition to this context, Tamilians (Cheran, Chozan, Pandian and Pallavan) have two scripts; Granthakshara (Pallava-grantha script) and modern Tamil scripts (tenmozhi ezhuthu – Southern lingual script).

  

Northern Tamilians called Pallavas, who ruled northern parts of Tamilnadu being based on Kanchipuram at times and Eastern Tamilians called Chozhas – based on Thanjavur, had a need of a script that could help transliterating works of other Indian languages; mainly Sanskrit. Since, this script was introduced which also had associations with Vattezhuthu, Kolezhuthu and also resulted towards the advancements of Tulu and Malayalam scripts. Hence, this Pallava grantha script was also called Vadamozhi ezhuthu – Northern lingual script.
