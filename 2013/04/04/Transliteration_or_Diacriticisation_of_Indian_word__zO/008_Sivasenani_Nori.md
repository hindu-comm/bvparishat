Sir



Based on an observation of good practices, if I were to formulate rules for translation and transliteration, they would along the following lines. I hope you find them useful.

Rules for Translating and Transliteration



1.  Carry only the prātipadika across languages. Thus Rāma and not
    Rāmaḥ, and ‘by Rāma’ and not Rāmeṇa. This means that we must not use
    forms like ‘spardha’ and ‘Ātmā’ – rather, we should use spardhā
    (ākārāntastrīliṅgaśabdaḥ) and Ātman (nakārāntapuṃliṅgaśabdaḥ). An
    exception may be made for words ending in ṛ, like pitṛ, dhātṛ, for
    which the nominal singular may be used – pitā, dhātā (as the
    ṛ-ending is not familiar to readers in English). In case of Brahman,
    which ought to be written the same way in masculine and neuter
    genders, to avoid confusion, one may use Brahman for the neuter and
    Brahmā for the masculine.



2.  Capitalization following the general custom in English should be
    based on the work. If English is the main language of the text,
    rules of capitalization may be followed; otherwise, not. Thus an
    essay onRamayana may use the capitalization of rules prevalent in
    English, but an article discussing the sūtra ‘*anabhihite*’ may
    avoid capitalization of Sanskrit proper names. The driving idea is
    that the writer’s thoughts need to be conveyed in as smooth a
    fashion as possible, with as little effort as possible. So, in case
    a particular piece of work could be characterized either way, it
    would be upto the author to decide the protocol. (This bias may be
    towards retaining capitalization).



3.  With names, common words should be written without diacritical
    marks, to the extent possible. The idea is to avoid unnecessary
    difficulties. As to what is common and what is not, it should be
    left to the author to decide. Again, the bias may be towards
    dropping diacritical marks.However, in certain cases – say where
    sentences from Sanskrit works are quoted, it is only proper that
    diacritical marks be used for common words like Rama and Vishnu
    also. Why? To maintain consistency throughout the quoted sentence.



4.  With respect to the practice of putting foreign words in italics,
    italics must be used only if Sanskrit is *foreign* to the particular
    genre. Here the author might not be the best judge – the very fact
    that he is using the words shows that he is familiar with the words.
    The general readermay be taken as a guide. Would the reader be
    familiar, or expected to be familiar, with something like
    *abhihitānvayavādaḥ* ? If yes, italics should not be used as they
    only interrupt the flow of the text. The bias may be towards
    dropping the italics.



5.  With respect to writing compound words, in Sanskrit there ought to
    be no space between the components of a compound: thus,
    vaidikadharmamārgaparatā. However in English, the tendency is
    towards using a space (say, ‘civil servant’) normally; when clarity
    is required a hyphen is used (round-table discussion); the words are
    fused together only when they become very common (overhang). When
    translating rājapuruṣaḥ of Sanskrit, ‘royal servant’ would be
    appropriate, but in transliterating or writing the Sanskrit word in
    English, ‘Rāja Puruṣaḥ’ is not done. Yet, that is what we do with
    ‘Sri Rama’, ‘Sri Krishna’ etc. Whether this is proper or not, it is
    socommon that ‘Srirama’ and ‘Srikrishna’ come across as odd. So
    while respecting conventions already being followed in the case of
    popular usages, newer words may be written following the principles
    of the source langauge. Thus, ‘mithyājñānam’ and not ‘mithyā-jñānam’
    or ‘mithyā ajñānam’. There is a new convention followed by the Clay
    Sanskrit Library
    ([www.claysanskritlibrary.org](http://www.claysanskritlibrary.org/))
    of inserting a vertical line between elements of a compund: thus,



 paśyati diśi diśi rahasi bhavantam

 tad\|adhara\|madhura\|madhūni pibantam;

 (tadadharamadhuramadhūni pibantam)

 nātha Hare, sīdati Rādhā vāsa\|gṛhe



Others do not seem to have taken it up (and so, may it remain). One may add that their scheme of capitalization is also not seen elsewhere.



There was an old convention of writing compound words with a period (or full-stop) or dot, separating the component terms. Thus: vaidika.dharma.mārga.paratā. The best that can be said about this convention is that this is less disruptive than the Clay convention, but this practice also did not catch on.
