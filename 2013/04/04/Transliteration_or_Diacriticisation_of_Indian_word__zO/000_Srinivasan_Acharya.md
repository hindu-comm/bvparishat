Dear Scholars,

  

Is there any form to guide in diacriticising Sanskrit words to Roman characters?

  

Characters of English and modern Tamil are less in number, since transliteration is complex. For instance, English and Tamil holds around 25 characters, while Sanskrit 51. Hence, roman-diacritics helps Sanskrit to be read fluently with English characters.

  

However, many of the Sanskrit and other Indian words are globalized like Yoga, Ayurveda, Krishna, Brahmana, Brahma, Brahman et al. Are these words necessarily transliterated in publication series like *popular series* or *general readers*?

  

If yes, how about Brahmanism, Brahmanical, Yogic, Vedic, Vaishnavism et al. The words such as Dharna, Bandh, Dalit and Almirah are accepted without diacritics.

  

You may please share your opinion on these.

  

Thanks and regards,

Srinivasan Acharya
