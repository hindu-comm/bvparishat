Dear Dr. Joshi,  
  

The Mahabharata gives so authentic first hand information on the planetary positions and eclipse data that it could not have been concocted by some people (by someone other than Vedavyasa at a later date) as some western scholars may think. The sophisticated astronomical softwares allow us to see that what Vedavyasa wrote did happen in the times of the Mahabharata war in 3139 BCE. It is unfortunate that some scholars were unable to interpret what Vedavyasa wrote and they used wrong data in their astronomical software and came out with some wrong dates of the Mahabharata war. Using correct data one finds that the war did take place towards the end of 3139 BCE and Bhishma passed away in the beginning of 3138 BCE, which was 36 years before the passing away of Lord Krishna in 3102 BCE.  
  

Regards,
