As it appeared to me from his language Dr.Joshi did not contest the fact that the Shakas are mentioned in the  

Mahabharata. His question was when we see the Shakas mentioned in the Mbh how could the Mbh have been written in 3000 BC. For, the Shakas appeared in history much later. He meant to say that in view of such facts it cannot be maintained that the Mahabharata in its current version is so old.

Dr. Joshi may kindly confirm if this interpretation of hios lettter is correct.
