Dear Shivraj Singh,



Are Shakas mentioned in Mahabharat or not? Shakas entered Indian subcontinent in the known history according to my knowledge. How does Mahabharata of 3000 BC know Shakas of the known history? Pease enlighten us so we can grow in our understanding of Mahabharata with you. Thanks. N.R.Joshi
