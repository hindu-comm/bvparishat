Dear Lalita Mishra and other Indian scholars involved in this debate,



Could you please explain to us the meaning of the word "antakhim" appeared in the Mahabharata verse along with Roma and Yavana? I assume scholars like you will be very enthusiastic to explain to me your understanding. Thanks. N.R.Joshi
