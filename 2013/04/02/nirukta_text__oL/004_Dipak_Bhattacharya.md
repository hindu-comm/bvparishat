Dear Dr. Prasad,

  
The translation could be downloaded but not the text. That did not harm because I have the full text from several old editions. The translation too is available at the market. What I lack is Durga's commentary on the second and third chapters. Is any one of the following available in hard or digitalised copy?  
S. V. Sāmaśramin, Rajwade, Bhadkamkar, the edition published by Mansukh Rai More in the fifties at Calcutta at the instance of the late Karunamay Saraswati, a well-known holy man of the fifties and sixties.  
Perhaps I am making this request for the second time. Unfortunately it so happens that the given links do not work. If it repeatedly fails I hesitate to inform because the fault might be of my own computer.

Any help will be highly appreciated and acknowledged when the occasion rises.  
Best  
DB
