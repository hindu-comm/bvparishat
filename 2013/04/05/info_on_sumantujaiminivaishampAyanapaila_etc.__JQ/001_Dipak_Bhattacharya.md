Dear Member,

There cannot be any doubt that the list means to speak of historical persons who propagated different branches of the Vedas, but I do not think that one can prove a definite connection with the Ṛgveda for all of them. Sumantu, for example, has been mentioned as a teacher of the Atharvaveda in the Guhyakālyupaniṣad 3 and Agnipurāṇa 271.8. Jaimini’s connection with the Sāmaveda is known from at least three sources –Jaiminīya-Saṃhitā of the Sāmaveda, Jaiminiīya-Brāhmaṇa, Jaiminiīya-Upaniṣad-Brāhmaṇa, As mentioned, the names are not dependable too. Sumantu appears as Sumantra in the Vaṃśa-Brāhmaṇa. In the Ṛgveda itself (10.69) on the other hand we find the name of Sumitra.

It seems that stories had gathered around the names hailing from antiquity, the names changed, so also the ideas of their Śākhā association. A comparative study of the Purāṇic and other lists may take one nearer the truth.

Best
