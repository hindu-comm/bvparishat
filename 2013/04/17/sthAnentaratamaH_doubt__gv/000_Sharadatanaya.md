Dear all  
  
In the sutra 1.1.50  
  
antaratamah is understood as sadrshatamah,  
  
but there is no usage in this meaning (any where in classical lit, in  
this context except here). So Charu Deva Sastry says in  
Vyakaranacandrodaya that we have to take meaning as sadrsha from cha  
kaara given in nanarthavarga of Amarakosa. My doubt is now why did not  
he quoted medinikosa where medinakara specifically quotes at the end  
as "sadrsheshu" for the antara word. Is that because none of the  
anekartha kosakaaraas prior to him has not taken sadrsha meaning?
