The 1909 critical edition by Negelein and Bolling, as far as I know, has not been reprinted. Ramkumar Rai brought out a Devnagari version of the text of the same edition sometime in the seventies. But it lacks Bolling-Negelein's valuable critical apparatus. The text is uncertain. So it is of little use without the critical apparatus.
