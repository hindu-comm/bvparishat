Dear Dr. Saha,  
My teacher late Professor Shivachandra Nyayacharya had a copy of Baccha Jha's book but he donated many of his books to scholars in Varanasi. I request you to see if the book is available at the Saanga Veda Vidyaalaya run by the sons of late MM. Rajeshwar Shastri. If I can trace a copy I shall let you know. You may perhaps also enquire at the convent near the Tulasi Ghat where Pt. Subrahmanya Shastri spent his last years of life.

Dear Scholars,  
  
Namaste! It would be a great service to all of us if any body could take initiative to translate the GUdhArthatattvAloka of BaccA JhA (an early 20th century Varanasi NavyanaiyAyika),the only available sub-commenatry on the GItAgUdhArthadIpikA of MadhusUdana SarasvatI into English. Though this is immensely technical but very original sub-commentary on MS's, it has hardly been studied or even written about. To the best of knowledge no translation of it either in English or any other language has been made yet. This commenatry is available with MS's in ShrImadbhagavadgItA with eight commentaries , edited by VAsudev LakSmaN ShAstrI PaNsIkar (Chaukhamba Sanskrit Pratishthan, New Delhi, reprint, 1999).  
  
With best rgs,  
Niranjan Saha
