Sir,

It is desired by your good self to 'hire software engineers and animators to show that the Vedas were scientific, down to earth and visionary'.

I submit that you may also need to involve in this pious mission
Scientists , Engineers, Social researchers devoted to Vedas in this great and much overdue project.

Kireet Joshi ji had rendered great services, but his mission requires to be carried forward and given wider publicity. 

With best regards,
