The Vedic Bibliography, BORI for the Vedas.

For Classical Sanskrit Gopika Mohan Bhattacharya edited the Praacii Jyoti.h from Kurukshetra Univ for some years. I do not know what became of it after him.  

Prof. Lalye, formerly of Hyderabad, published a Bibliograohy of the Puraa.nas in the early nineties.

Karl Potter for Indian philosophy till the seventies.  

A.K.Warder's Indian Buddhism has an up to date bibliography on Buddhism till 2000.  

Similar outdated bibliographies exist for many other subjects. Barring the VB BORI, Lalye and Karl Potter none could be comprehensive when they were published.
