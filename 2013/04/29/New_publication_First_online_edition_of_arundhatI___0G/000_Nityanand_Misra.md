A brief introduction follows below.  
  
Arundhatī is a Mahākāvya in Hindi which was composed by Svāmī Rāmabhadrācārya during early 1990s at Chitrakoot. The epic was published in 1994 by the Shri Raghav Sahitya Prakashan Nidhi, Haridwar. The book was released by the then President of India, Shankar Dayal Sharma, at his official residence in New Delhi.  
  
The epic Arundhatī presents the narrative of the Ṛṣi Dampatī (seer-couple) Arundhatī and Vasiṣṭha, drawn from various Hindu scriptures including Śiva Purāṇa, Śrīmadbhāgavatam, Vālmīkīya Rāmāyaṇa, Mahābhārata, Brāhmaṇa texts, Śrīrāmacaritamānasa, and Vinayapatrikā. Parallel to the narrative is the underlying theme of psychological evolution of humans as per the Bhāratīya tradition.  
  
The epic consists of 1280 verses, divided into 15 Sargas titled Sṛṣṭi, Praṇaya, Prīti, Paritoṣa, Pratīkṣā, Anunaya, Pratiśodha, Kṣamā, Śakti, Uparāma, Prabodha, Bhakti, Upalabdhi, Utkaṇṭhā, and Pramoda. Various Hindi metres, Saṃskṛta metres (inlcuding Indravaṃśā, Indravajrā, Upajāti, Upendravajrā, Drutavilambita, Pañcacāmara, Mandākrāntā, Mālinī, Vaṃśastha , Vasantatilakā, Viṣayārati, Śārdūlavikrīḍita, Śikhariṇī), Prākṛta metres (including Chappaya, different types of Savaiyā) and Gītakas are employed in the epic.  
  
Steeped in Saṃskāras, enriched with the notions of Karma-Jñāna-Bhakti, and embellished with Rasas and Alaṅkāra, the epic is a testimony to the values of Sanātana Dharma and the Vedic heritage of Bhārata.
