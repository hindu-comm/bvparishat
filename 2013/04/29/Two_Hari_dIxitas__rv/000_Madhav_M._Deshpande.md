Dear BVP Members,  
  
 Namo namaḥ,  
  
 I am looking at two works authored by someone named Hari Dīkṣita.
The Bṛhacchabdaratna is clearly written by Hari Dīkṣita who is the grandson of Bhaṭṭoji Dīkṣita, the son of Vīreśvara, calling himself Vaireśvari. There is another work, the Brahmasūtravṛtti authored by Hari Dīkṣita (published in the Anandashrama Sanskrit Series, no. 82), and this Hari Dīkṣita calls himself Lakṣmīnaraharisūrisūnu, his work dated to Śaka 1658. On the face of it, these are two different Hari Dīkṣitas, and yet I have noted that the Brahmasūtravṛtti seems to follow Bhaṭṭoji Dīkṣita's Tattvakaustubha in criticizing the Dvaita of Madhva and (p. 162) refers to the Tattvakaustubha of Bhaṭṭoji Dīkṣita: *vistaras tu tattvakaustubhe draṣṭavyaḥ.* I am wondering about the relationship of these two Hari Dīkṣitas. I will appreciate if anyone has any suggestions or references to any publications that deal with this question.
