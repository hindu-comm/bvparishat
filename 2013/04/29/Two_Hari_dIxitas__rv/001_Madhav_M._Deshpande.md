Dear BVP members,  
  

The mystery of the two Hari Dīkṣitas is now resolved satisfactorily.
Hari Dīkṣita, the author of the Brahmasūtravṛtti is the son of Lakṣmīnṛsiṃha who composed the Advaitic commentary Ābhoga on Kalpataru, a commentary on Vācaspatimiśra's Bhāmatī, and this Lakṣmīnṛsiṃha is the son of Kauṇḍabhaṭṭa, who is the nephew of Bhaṭṭoji Dīkṣita. So, one Hari Dīkṣita is the author of the Bṛhacchabdaratna, and the grandson of Bhaṭṭoji Dīkṣita, while the other Hari Dīkṣita is the great-grandson of Bhaṭṭoji Dīkṣita's brother Raṅgojibhaṭṭa. No wonder that both Hari Dīkṣitas show respect to Bhaṭṭoji Dīkṣita. Best,
