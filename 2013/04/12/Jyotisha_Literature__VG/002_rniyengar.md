Dear Dr.Narayanan,  
  
Nice post! But let me know why you expect even proper names like  
Lagadha to be derivable from dhAtus?  
About atharvaNa-jyotis.am, (aka Atma-jyotis.am) a text of this name  
was edited and published in 1924 by Pt.Bhagavaddatta in Lahore. He  
does not attribute this text to Lagadha. This text is not similar to  
VJ either. If you like to see it pl send me a private mail.  
  
regards  
  
RNI

\> Moreover, it is important to convey the contributions of India to the studies on the cosmos. There are other features regarding sun, moon and earth are to be investigated on the basis of oriental as well as the oxidental text relevant to it. The archaeogeodesy is too relevant as it is the area of study encompassing prehistoric and the ancient place determination method, the navigation (on the land or the water), point positioning, measure and representation of the earth, geodynamic phenomena, and the applied astronomy. The archaeogeodesy, by combining the fundamental astronomy, geodetic knowledge, applied mathematics, accurate positional data and archaeology, presents a methodology for investigating the architecture, placements, spatial properties, relationships and the arrangements of prehistoric sites and monuments. As a new area of inquiry, the archaeogeodesy presents unique avenues of assessing the ancient understandings of geography, of place, and  
\> of the earth and the cosmos as evidenced by the archaeological remains. The famous work popular by the title: The Vedāṅga Jyotiṣa of Lagadha in Its Ṛk and Yajus Recensions: With the Translation and Notes of Prof. T.S. Kuppanna Sastry is available too. The Yajus recensions and Rk variants and commentary of Somākara Śeṣanāga to Vedāṅga Jyotiṣa is also popular. It is heard that there are 162 verses in the Atharvana Jyotisha attributed to Lagadha too. I do not know the availability of the same. Regarding Aryabhata's contributions to cosmology is summed up in the following site:<http://www.jqjacobs.net/astro/aryabhata.html>  
\> Most of popular names, particularly the Indian names do have some sort of grammatical etymology. I failed to trace the etymology of the term: Lagadha, the name of the author. There could be the combinations possible of the roots लग खञ्जीभावे, लग सङ्गे (both भ्वादिः) and लग स्वादे (चुरादिः) with the other root डुधाञ् धारणपोषणयोः etc. But this is only an imagination, and if formed the meaning is to be justified with the derivatory sentence. At the same time another term: लग्न is well derived in the Vacaspatyam, the term is from the root लग (a manipulated form from लस्ज व्रीडने) with क्तः suffix substituted with न. As well as it takes कन् suffix too in another mode of derivation, the term is very much associated with the cosmic science, as Amara says:  
\> मेषादिराशीनामुदयः.  
\> More comments expected from the scholars of cosmology.
