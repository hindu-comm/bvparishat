Dear All,

  

Almost a year back, I remember, I had come across some audio recordings (those were also downloadable as MP3 files) of someone teaching Kāśikā. I do not recall who it was and what was the source online. I once again tried searching online with no success at all. However, I did find some files uploaded by 'Veda Bhoomi' on [www.archive.org](http://www.archive.org) teaching the Siddhāntakaumudī. I would highly appreciate if someone could direct me to a source (online) where I can find the audio files of Kāśikā or other texts of Vyākaraṇa being taught exhaustively preferably either in English or in Sanskrit. I would highly appreciate this help. Thanks very much in advance.

  

Best wishes.

  

Mrinal Kaul
