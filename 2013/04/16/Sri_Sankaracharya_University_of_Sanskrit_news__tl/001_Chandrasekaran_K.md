I do not know anything about the SSUS. So I would not comment on how true is the reporting.

  

But over the last several years, many of my friends and I, have noticed that "The Hindu" has developed an anti-sanathana dharma and anti-vedic culture and anti-brahmin reporting style.

  

So I would not place too much faith in the report.

  

If you see the interview, Panikkar seems to have the wrong attitude for a language based University. How well can an institution perform with such an attitude?

  

I am biased against The Hindu, I admit. However, to me it appears to be a case of "give the dog a bad name and hang it" instead of helping an institution with a noble cause to prosper.

  

There may be others who may know more about SSUS and who can enlighten us on the SSUS and how it can become a world class University to promote Sanskrit and Vedic culture. 

  

Regards  

  

Chandrasekaran
