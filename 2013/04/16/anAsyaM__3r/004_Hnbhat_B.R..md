Is the word अनास्यं with respect to 'not related to nose' साधु or असाधु ?  

  

Dr. Narayanan has given the explanation to the meaning you have given. But without context it is difficult to decide whether it is correct word or not.

  

*t can an_Asya = not related to mouth. anAsya-viharaNe.*

*  
*

*Asya can be mouth and also face.*

*  
*

*Nirutsuka - without anxiety, tranquil. without agitation -. which is correctly interpreted as Narayanan has whown with meanings in english for both and grammatical derivation.*

*  
*

*  
*
