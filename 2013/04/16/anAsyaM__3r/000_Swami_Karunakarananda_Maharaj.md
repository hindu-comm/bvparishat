Respected Scholars,  
  

Is the word अनास्यं with respect to 'not related to nose' साधु or असाधु ?  
  

In the Kiratarjuniyam 3.40 there is the word निरुत्सुकानाम् is interpreted as अदुर्मनायमानानाम्. How is possible? It appears it is interpreted with opposite meaning! In any Kosha is the word निरुत्सुक means अदुर्मनः ?
