Respected Scholars,  
  

Harih Om. I came across Gayatri Ramayana gleaned from Ramayana. It is said to represent the Gayatri when all its first letters are joined together. But I find all the first letters do not tally with Gayatri Mantra. Then how come it is named as Gayatri Ramayana?  

Can anyone tell me how old is this tradition of identifying these shlokas with Gayatri mantra, is it very old or imagined by modern scholars?
