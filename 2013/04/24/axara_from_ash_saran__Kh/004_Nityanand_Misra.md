There is one more rule involved in the derivation - तितुत्रतथसिसुसरकसेषु च (7-2-9). This rule is a a पुरस्तादपवाद of आर्धधातुकस्येड्वलादेः (7-2-35) and blocks the वलाडि इट् which would have occurred in case of अश् सरन्.

  

In absence of 7-2-9, none of the three rules (8-2-36, 8-2-41 and 8-3-59) would be applicable and the अनिष्टरूप "अशिसर" would result.
