Sir, I hundred percent agree with your view that theword NavyaVyakarana isthe imitation of the word Navya Nyaya, and is bases on the linguistic affinity. Naagesa is pioneering this method and usage. Kaundabhatta is also proved to be a Navya-vaiyakarana whilespeakingthe word of Navya-Nyaya, as‘Visesana-vibhakti’ in his Bhusanasara. So. only two authors areproved as Navyas. Rest Vidvamsah pramaanam.

I would like to thank all those who responded to my question regarding the division between prācīna and navya vyākaraṇa. Like the view expressed by Shri H N Bhat, I believe that the navya phase of vyākaraṇa begins with the introduction of the language of navya-nyāya in grammatical works, especially those of Kauṇḍabhaṭṭa and Nāgeśa, and probably has little to do with the distinction between the Kāśikā method of studying Pāṇini in a textually linear fashion and the Prakriyā method that begins with Dharmakīrti's Rūpāvatāra and culminates in the work of Bhaṭṭojī. I am especially interested in looking at all those places where Nāgeśa uses expressions like "Navyās tu" to distinguish his own views from those of earlier grammarians, often including Bhaṭṭojī and Kauṇḍabhaṭṭa. The commentaries of Vaidyanātha in particular are very useful in identifying who Nāgeśa is referring to in his criticisms.
This use of "navya" is probably a much more specific use referring to Nāgeśa's own views as against those of other older grammarians, and has probably little to do with the use of navyanyāya terminology. In any case, the discussion on the list has been very useful, and I wish to thank all responders. With best wishes for the new year,
