नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

नव्यव्याकरणम् --

  

Roughly we may say it is the system from Bhattoji onwards -

  

conspicuous is the refutation of Navyanaiyayikas in their terminology , of Pracinavaiyakaranas and Mimamsakas as well .

  

In fact, right from Samgraha -Vasurata - Candracarya - Bhartrhari - Kaiyata down to Haradatta the views of Naiyayikas and Mimamsakas were attacked. But with the advent of Navyanyaya it became unbearable for Vaiyakaranas and there was a shift , especially in terms of Sabdabodha .

  

Till then both Prakriya and Arthikam were running hand in glove and in Navyavyakarana they became separate entities . Of course , the order of Astadhyayi also was changed to suit Prakriya and the Vaidikaprakriya was put on the back burner .

  

Paramalaghumanjusa is not authored by Nagesa and it is better to teach Laghumanjusa .

  

धन्यो’स्मि
