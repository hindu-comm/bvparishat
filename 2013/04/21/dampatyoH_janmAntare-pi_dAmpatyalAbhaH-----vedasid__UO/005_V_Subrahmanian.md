Dear Misra ji,  
  
I agree that many interpretations are there with reference to scriptural texts.  
  
I pointed to those verses from the rAmagItA only because the method delineated there is so typical of Advaita. For instance the bhAgalakShaNa is thus explained there:  
  

*तत्त्वंपदार्थौ परमात्मजिवकावसीति चैकात्म्यमथानयोर्भवेत् ॥ २५ ॥*

*प्रत्यक्परोक्षादिविरोधमात्मनोर्विहाय संगृह्य तयोश्चिदात्मताम् ।*

*संशोधितां लक्षणया च लक्षितां ज्ञात्वा स्वमात्मानमथाद्वयो भवेत् ॥ २६ ॥*

एकात्मकत्वाज्जहती न संभवेत्तथा जहल्लक्षणता विरोधतः ।

*सोऽयंपदार्थाविव भागलक्षणा युज्येत तत्त्वंपदयोरदोषतः* ॥ २७ ॥

The two, the jIva and parama AtmA, are to be shorn of their upAdhi-s and the chinmAtram, pure consciousness alone, is retained which is not avidyA-born. And this chinmAtram is not two but one only. There are no two entities left after such an aikyam is realized. Such is not the case in a mitratA bhAva which would require two distinct entities.  
  
In this site there is material pertaining to the above:  
  
<http://www.srivaishnavam.com/philosophy/vedartha_sangraha10.htm>  
  
Here Sri Ramanuja is refuting the Advaitin's resorting to 'so'yam devadattaH' type for (bhAga) lakShaNA to arrive at the absolute aikyam in the 'tat tvam asi'. Whereas in the rAmagItA it is exactly this lakShaNA with this very so'yam is taught as the method of arriving at the aikyam. From this it is clear that the Ramanuja school does not apply this lakShaNA to the tat tvam asi. In fact, for them there is no need for resorting to any lakShaNA; the vAkyam is straightforward in yielding the meaning.  
  
I took up the question only with reference to the Ramanuja school of vishishtAdvaita's acceptance of this work as authentic.  
  
Also, pl. let me know if this usage in the rAmagita is any special :  
  
विविक्त आसीन *उपारतेन्द्रियो*  
विनिर्जितात्मा विमलान्तराशयः । (first half of verse 46)   
  
Is 'उपरतेन्द्रियः’ also correct? Is the dIrgha chAndasa?  
  
warm regards
