Adhyātmarāmāyaṇam along with Agastya Saṁhitā and Rāmacaritamānasa is one of the most widely respected scriptures in the Rāmānanda Sampradāya. The Sampradāya's philosophy is Viśiṣtādvaita like that of the Rāmānuja Sampradāya with some differences. Both count Bodhāyana as a Pūrvācārya.

  

Needless to say, as with Upaniṣads, same verses are interpreted differently. For example the term "Aikya" is interpreted in the sense Mitratā (close relationship or friendship), as used by Valmiki in रामसुग्रीवयोरैक्यं देव्येवं समजायत (VR 5-35-51) in the episode of friendship of Śrīrāma and sugrīva.

  

There is nothing surprising here. We all know that there are many texts apart from Prasthānatrayī like Adhyātmarāmāyaṇam and Śrīmadbhāgavatam which are read and interpreted differently by different Sampradāyas. The same Śrīmadbhāgavatam has numerous commentaries subscribing to philosophies as different as chalk and cheese.
