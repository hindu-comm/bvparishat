Dear Dr. Narayanan,

Let me clarify if I was not clear in my earlier post.  

For Vaisheshika, everything that exists is included in six categories: substance, quality, action, the general, the particular, and the inherent. Substance, which expresses the essence of a thing, is the main category. The nine substances (earth, water, light, air, ether, time, space, spirit, and mind), which are endowed with qualities (permanent characteristics) and actions (transient characteristics), make up the entire existing universe.  

Vaisheshikas maintain an atomistic view, according to which the first four substances were combinations of atoms (*anu*) —invariable spherical material particles. Atoms were not created by anyone and exist eternally, they are passive: they start to move because of an invisible force, *adrishta*, and then enter into combinations under the direction of the world spirit Brahma, which subjects the material world to the eternal cyclical process of creation and destruction. The sensuously apprehended world exists in time, space, and ether and is governed by a special universal moral law (*dharma*).  

They accept the existence of God called Ishwara or Maheshwara which is the Supreme Intelligent Being under whose will this world is created, sustained and dissolved. The starting point of the creation is the Will of God. The first product of the Will is Brahma. Brahma proceeds with further creation in accordance with the totality of the unseen merits and demerits of the individual souls by setting in motion the atoms to combine with one another causing the world. The process of dissolution is in the reverse order where Brahma gives up his body and Ishwara takes charge of the process of dissolution. The whole world is then reduced to the primary state of padarthas. This shows that Vasheshika system of philosophy was theistic in outlook.

Since in Vaishesika systems one has to face with the concept of Adrasta, Karmas of the individual jivas, the functioning of the atoms are controlled by divine will and soon its theory may not be tenable to physics or modern science
