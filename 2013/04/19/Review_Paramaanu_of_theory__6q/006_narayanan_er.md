Thank you Sir, for your valuable reply.

The terminology of aṇu and its concept may not be a modern atomic theory.  

Etymologically minuteness will more be appropriate, I think, rather than atomic अणति सूक्ष्मत्वं गच्छति इति अणु (derivation the Sabdakalpadruma)। अण शब्दे। अण्+उः। 1-7 भृमृशीतॄचरित्सरितनिधनिमिमस्जिभ्य उ:। 1-8 अणश्च।

  

To Shri. Ajitji:  

I also appreciate Shri. Ajitji for his view points too. But I would like to believe that the sages have acquired the knowledge, as the knowledge revealed to them, rather than they guess something. Guessing hypothesis can even be a common man job. In Kanada's sutras I failed to see any god, but dharma is well there. But Prasastapada brings the god to scene I am afraid.

  

Regards,

Narayanan
