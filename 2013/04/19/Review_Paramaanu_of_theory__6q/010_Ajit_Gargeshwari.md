Dear Prof. Bhattacharya,  
  
This is my understanding.  
Most important in the system of Vaisheshika is the understanding of the atomic nature of all the elements. This philosophy was originally realist and non theistic in orientation. Only later was the notion of God imputed to it. This is **another view** considering the interpretation of the sutras which are done in light of Prasthan pada Bhashyas.  
  
**Do we find this graphic description before Udayanācārya**?  
The generally naturalistic or atomic outlook of Vaishesika complimented the heuristic and syllogistic methods of Nyaya, and with Udayana the two schools merged into one.The school of Navya Nyaya, that emerged in eastern India was particularly sophisticated philosophically. Nyaya developed proofs of the existence of God (which are not found in the Vaisheshika), which compare quite well to those developed in Christian theology. Though Nyaya-Vaisheshika has very few adherents today, it developed philosophical tools that all the other Indian traditions used. They were particularly useful in refuting other schools of thought.*  
*  
“Logic” or “Argumentation,” is indeed the central thrust of the Nyaya tradition. Because it also had a strong realist bias, it was easily merged with the earlier Vaisheshika school. Whereas the focus of Vaisheshika was the nature of things and how to categorize them, the focus of Nyaya is on the method of argument, syllogism, and the reliable means for knowing.
