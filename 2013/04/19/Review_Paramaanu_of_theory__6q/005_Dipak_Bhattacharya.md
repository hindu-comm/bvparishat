Dear dr narayanan,

I am no specialist in vaiśeṣika or nuclear theory, still my guru's words and school education make a few things certain for me.

The vaiśeṣika aṇu is a theoretical concept, it is the theoretically smallest possible physical particle. Whatever advancement one makes in discovering finer and finer particles the Vaiseshika atom will maintain its size that will be measured relatively that is to say in relation to the latest discovered smallest particle. The vaiseshika aṇu is beyond measure. It is smaller than the smallest measured. Hence there will never be a sub-aṇu or aṇutara (An inconsistency lies in the fact that the absolute size too has been stated which is incongruous with the above stand of the relative status of the aṇu. But that is a different story.)

The atom of modern physics, on the contrary, is of fixed quantity and divisible. Its components are called sub-atoms. These sub-atoms -- boson, photon, electron, proton, neutron etc are currently more important the atom of the nineteenth century. When further divisions are, hopefully, discovered they will become relatively unimportant. But the vaiśeṣika anu stands at the same place as it formerly belonged to, to the theoretically smallest possible measurement without a sub-aṇu..

Best
