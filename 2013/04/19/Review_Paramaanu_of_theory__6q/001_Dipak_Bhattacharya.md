Mrinal Kanti Ganguly's work was coomprehensive and faithful to the Vaiseshika view.

I asked some Naiyayikas if the old theory could be reviewed in the light of modern discoveries. Every pandit was vehemently opposed to any reforrm of the Sastric point of view. Our traditional scholarshipdoes not believe that anything could be beyond the knowledge of the omniscientrshis. It may be noted that the modern view that sound is a property of air and not of aakaa;sa was apprehendedby some Miimaamsakas. Others did not accept it. The theory of the rotation of the earth was so much opposed by Aaryabhata's posterity (Varaahamihira, Bhaaskara, Brahmagupta, Appayya Dikshita) that the very textof theAaryabhatiiyamhad been changed. *bhvaavartta* (earth's rotation)was changed to *bhaavartta* (rotation of the space globe).

I suggest one thing. We may request the UGC that knowledge ofthe exact nature of the Vai;se.sika theory of atoms should be made compulsory for higher secondary students in science.
