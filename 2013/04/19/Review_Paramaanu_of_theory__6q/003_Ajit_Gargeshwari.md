Dear Dr. Narayanan,  
  
The paramanus (atoms) are indivisible and eternal, they can neither be created nor destroyed.Each paramanuu (atom) possesses its own distinct vishesa (individuality).  
  
What Vaisheshikas believed were just the best empirical guesses they could have made at that time. One can easily find some faults in Vaisheshika theories. They believe atom cannot be destroyed, but actually it can be destroyed and we have no doubt about it now. They call akasha and space different and infinite, so how are they different? We cannot call mixture of space and air as a new ultimate substance and if they are referring to only atmosphere of earth as akasha then it's not infinite. Further they called fine dust particles as smallest particles therefore atom but dust particle is much much bigger than an individual atom.  
  
So in my opinion they were great thinkers and proposed great theory
that could have been produced at that time, they mixed science and God which was great move but now their theory holds no good for us. Vaishesika atomism also differs from the atomic theory of modern science: according to the Vaishesikas, the functioning of atoms was guided or directed by the will of the Supreme Being. This is therefore a theistic form of atomism which no modern scientific theory or any physicists can accept.  
  
All I can say is their guesses were best possible guesses according to their time. As time has changed the Vaisheshikas theory of atomicity is obsolete and irralvent to a modern thinker or scientist.  
  
One can also refer to <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomism>. it is wiki article may be read with discretion
