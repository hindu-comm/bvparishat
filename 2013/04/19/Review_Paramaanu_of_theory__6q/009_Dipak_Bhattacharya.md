\<Atoms were not created by anyone and exist eternally, they are passive: they start to move because of an invisible force, *adrishta*, **and then enter into combinations under the direction of the world spirit Brahma**, which subjects the material world to the eternal cyclical process of creation and destruction. The sensuously apprehended world exists in time, space, and ether and is governed by a special universal moral law (*dharma*). \>

This depiction is fine. But, Dr.Gargeshwari, **do we find this graphic description before Udayanācārya**? Dr. Chemparathi, Utrecht, originally a Syriac Christian who migrated from Kerala to the Netherlands drew the attention of scholars to this view of Udayana which, he thought, was closely similar to the Christian view of creation as found with Thomas Aquinas among others.

I think that the Mādhvas also have similar ideas.
