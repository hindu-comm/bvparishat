Namaste



1. The historicity issues are really sensitive and trigger knee jerk reactions. I respect the sampradya; but let us not bring pre /post points of Dattatreya and Patanjali here. Gita, Upanishads,Brahma Sutra are good enough anchors for this post/pre- time line ordering.



2. Patanjali never said that he was the first teacher; The interesting point is PYS does not refer to ANY other Yogacharaya /Guru of past, any specific text, which is a key point you see in Brahma Sutras Or Jaimini. The entire work could have been written just yesterday or a thousand years before Gita ! or as a supplement of Brahma Sutra ! There are no clues in the frame of Yoga-Sutra text itself. It is a clean simple self complete text.



3. The question raised by me is specific :How do we ascertain what text-reading, what interpretation school, what sampradaya of practice was the anchor of Patanjali Yoga Sutra text as we have it now ? And in specific reference to YS 4-34, concluding the discourse ?
