Let me hasten to clarify, when I said "older manuscript evidence" I only meant that manuscripts are no doubt older than any of the printed editions that people commonly use nowadays. I wouldn't want to make any conclusions or even hypotheses about identities and relative dates of patanjali, vyAsa, bhoja etc.



Best regards,
