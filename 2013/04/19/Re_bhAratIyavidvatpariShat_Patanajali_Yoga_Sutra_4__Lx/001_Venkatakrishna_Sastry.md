Namaste



1. That specifically is the point : \< I wonder what the older manuscript evidence is. \>.



2. The question is a little wider and deeper: What was the tradition by which Yoga Sutra lived across the time span from ' Patanjali to Acharya Shankara and later Vedanta-Bhashya kaaras' ? Is this jsut an issue of sutra variant reading OR Totally different tradition/s which we seem to be missing ? at some historical point ?
Who needs to research / address this ? How ? Why ? The search is for the anchor of evidence.



And how would one connect the last sutra 4-34 to the opening made :
1-2 to 1-4 ? in variant readings ? Patanjali has no definiiton within the Sutras on what is 'Chitta'. It is a word 'given' and of multivalent constructed meanings according to Samskrutha Vyakaranam. If one postulates 'Chiti' as a 'Vedic - independent word' distnct from
'Chitta', the gateswould open up for new investigation threads from Tantra perspective / Kundalini yoga. More fronts for exploration.



3. On the point \<depending on the सूत्र reading adopted, there is room for interpretation about what is the sense in which this equation is made. \> The question could be : If Gita , prior to Patanjali taught a perspective/s of Yoga;  and Gita inherited this perspective for consolidation as a ' Veda- Upanishat tradition', are we to postualte a 'Standard Language Continuity for Samskrutham -Vyakaranam' ?? IE lingusits would be disturbed on this and seek 'evidence' ! Contra, the ' Maanushee vak' protogonists ( and seeking Tamil in Ramayana of Valmiki) would argue for the equated antuity time line of Tamil !



The timeline of history and understanding of yoga-Vedanta links are at stake here. This can be resolved only by a relook at the history of Indian languages prior to Panini up to Valmiki. Any clues from hard evidence beyond what is already known in the 'guru-paramparaa' anchored to ' Vyasa / Naaraayana /Asmadaacharya paryantaam ' ??
