Thanks for the details. punaH AkshepaH kriyate - the indented parts below would need clarification. Please excuse me for drawing out more and more on this thread of discussion.

**BVK Sastry (on ) :** Here the question is not what I want. The question is what the sutra is capable of giving out as (a) lingusitic construction per se (b) As Intrinsic harmony of the text (c) As understood in the Yoga-Shastra tradition (d) As understood by other Shaastra-darshanas for making the aakshepa and rejecting \<etena yogaH pratuktaH> ?

^^^^^^^^^^^

**BVK Sastry (on ) :** The concept of \<Purushasya eva, na tu PrakruteH> - equally applies to Prakruti part also. \<PrakruteH swaroopa-pratishThaa = Purushasya Kaivalyam \> ?! Only the question would be :Is Praakruti the \<active agent - swatantraH kartaa/kartree> . Once Purusha-Prakruti samyoga is resolved - i.e. 100% separation of Purusha from entanglement with Prakruti, it also means 100% Prarkuti is \< Established in it self = prakruteH swa-roop-pratishthaa \>. May be that is not the traditonal view, holding on to the ' purusha-kartRutva' approach. In which case, Prakruti - following the Tantra Or the Maayaa model, frees the Purusha from her holds (Eg ; Devi saptashati :
harinetra-krutaalayaa maayaa ..)

The 'Purusha Moksha/Kaivalya' - statement is an image of Prarkruti moksha' also.Both ned to occur simultaneously. It is not Purusha Kaivalya and Prarkuti in bandhana.

^^^^^^^^^^^

**BVK Sastry (on ) :** Please explain. If i translate this sentence, it appears like \<Kaivalya is swaroopa-pratishThaa of Chitishakti> ; and what is \<chitishakti> ? Why not just \<chiteH> ? What is the difference between kevalaa chit and \< shaktimat - Chit>

^^^^^^^^^^^

**BVK Sastry (on ) :** Here , there is a difficulty within yoga-sutra text itself. The word \< Kaivlyam> is defined in two other sutras earlier as below:



(3-55)sattva-purushayoh shuddhi-sAmye kaivalyam iti (Notice the dvivachana and dvandva)

3-50) tad-vairaagyaadapi dosha-beeja-kshaye kaivalyam



Why three phased definitions of the same technical word \<Kaivalyam> ? in two different sections - as a Siddhi in third (vibhuti) paada and final goal in fourth (kaivalya) pada, concluding the Yoga-discourse? Is this a progressive journey from \<samadhi> so much totued for the Jeevanmukti criterion and beyond \< from Samadhi to Kaivalya , about which not many even mention in the current period ? Is this some thing that Yogopanishads take up as a journey to ' Avadhoota phase' from ' parama hamsa-parivrajaka' phase ?

^^^^^^^^^^^

**BVK Sastry (on ) :** Why? How? What is \< chitishakti> beyond a \< vRutti> in relation to \<Jeeva> in Yoga sutra ?



Is Jeeva -bhAva same as ' a \<Chitta-vRutti-sthti>, a shell mode, a
koha / aavaraNa -  where in a deeper, yet specific yoga of Purusha-Prakrutiis yielding a \<sva-roopa> in terms of Yoga-sutra 1-4: tada draShTuH swa-roope avashtanam ; 1-3 : vRutti sAroopyam itaratra> is operating> ?



Given the fact that in the Yoga-sutra, the word \<chitta> is not defined ?



There are concpets like \< nimrANa chittani> - (4-4) -nirmANa-chittAnyasmitA - mAtrAt



Who is the \< Master -owner of the vRutti and Chittaas vRuttyAdhaara 
\> - in relation to the sutra \< 4-18 : sadA jnAtaaH chitta-vRuttayaH tat-prabhoh purushasya -pariNAmitvAt>

^^^^^^^^^^^

**BVK Sastry (on ) :**  \<There is no room> ? If \<samAsa> is by \< vivkShaatah>,? The classic example of \< neelotpalam> ? The existing schools have preferred a reading. that is fine as a \<sampradaya>. but does it rule out the \< possibility>? and if there is a possibility, how is it refuted ?

^^^^^^^^^^^

**BVK Sastry (on ) :**

I agree with you on the valid point that common terminology across Shaastra platforms should not be used for analogy. Here i am pointing to the word 'Kaivalyam' within the frame of the Yoga-sutra accepted text . References above.

^^^^^^^^^^^

**BVK Sastry (on ) :**  What is already in \<vRutti> is not a limiting facotr for the wide meaning and scope of the sutra itself ? Mahabhshya points to this primacy of sutra over interpretation. The original meaning construction is within the context of Yoga-sutra text; The Bhashya is a next level recourse.

**BVK Sastry (on ) :** covered above.

^^^^^^^^^^^

**BVK Sastry (on ) :** \< Against the tenets of yogasutram, as understood> - Yes. But the question is : Is the interpretation consistent within the Sutra context itslef ?



If one line of yoga-sutra interpreters 9like interpreters of Brahma sutra rejeted the other view, that is fine. It does not rule out the valid possibility from sutra itself.

Why should \<gati-samAsa> option be ruled out here? technically ??
