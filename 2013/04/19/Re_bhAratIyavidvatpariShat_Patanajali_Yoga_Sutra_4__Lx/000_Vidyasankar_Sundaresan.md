All publications that I have seen, quoting YS, readचितिशक्तिरिति, using only the nominative case, not the possessive. This includes the 1983 SUNY Albany edition of Swami Hariharananda Aranya's commentary, with English translation by P N Mukerji. Consequently, the interpretation is along the lines of कैवल्यम् = चितिशक्तिरिति पुरुषस्य स्वरूपप्रतिष्ठा.



Note, however - पुरुषस्य चितिशक्तिरेव केवला, तस्याः सदा तथैवावस्थानं कैवल्यमिति. The तस्याः could support areadingof the सूत्र as चितिशक्तेरिति.



One could argue that in both cases, ultimately in the state of kaivalya, पुरुष = चितिशक्ति, but depending on the सूत्रreading adopted, there is room for interpretation about what is the sense in which this equation is made. I wonder what the older manuscript evidence is.



Best regards,
