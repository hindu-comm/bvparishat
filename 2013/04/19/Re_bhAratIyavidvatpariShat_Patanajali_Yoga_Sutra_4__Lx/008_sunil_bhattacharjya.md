Namaste,  
  
It appears that when Patanjali said "Now the exposition of the Yoga" he was just acting as a teacher and that did not mean that he was the first teacher of Yoga. Historically Dattatreya was a much earlier teacher of Yoga and probably the first teacher of yoga, as seen from the concluding portion of the Dattatreya Yogashastra.  
  

As regards Patanjali being the guru of Adi Shankaracharya that appears to be an impossible situation. The story that Gaudapada was a student of Patanjali could be possible and it could be that Govindapada need not be thought to be the direct disciple of Gaudapada, There could have been some intemediate teachers in between Gaudapada and Govindapada. The saying that Govindapada was an incarnation of Patanjali could mean that Govindapada was an authority of his time in the Panajali yoga.
