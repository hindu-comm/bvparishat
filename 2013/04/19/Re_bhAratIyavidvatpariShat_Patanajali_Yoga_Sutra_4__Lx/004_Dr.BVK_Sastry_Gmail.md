1. On the specific point : \< And on the variants, a critical Edition is necessary of the text \> How does the traditional schools intend to go on this line ?? Are there necessary tools ? And the ‘will power’ to ‘face the toils on the line’ ??



2. On the specific point : \< So it could not be resolved finally by some glimpses on the readings. In both the meaning could be arrived. citi samjnane, citi smrtyam, cittam cit and also probably citi. from the same root. The difference between the readings will depend on the context and the commentaries on the reading. \>



What does this lead to as a conclusion ? Options to explore ? Doubts and clinkers in the traditional schools teaching process as well as Academic research publications ? The eye turns to the ‘ authenticity of Language Tool’ – namely Paninian Samskrutham ( Not the PIE / linguistics). The fire is turned on to the authenticity of ‘Dhatu-Patha’, Gana-Patha, The processing rules of Krit and Ting , the meaning of the upasargas, pick of the root by preference to interpret a tradition ??



Now, if for argument sake, if one says that one ( preferred /historic ?) school of Yoga was eyed by Vedanta-Acharyas for refuting in writing commentary on Brahma-Sutra Bhashya, does it mean that Acharya had in the process, refuted all possible variants of Yoga-school interpretation of Yoga-Sutra ( and Samkhya linked to it) poova-paksha ? Do we have any tradition of Yoga schools reverting back to refute Vedanta views ?
How much of Yoga was digested by ‘ yama-niyama-aasana … paareena -
… Ashtanga yoga Nishthaa gareena’ – Vedanta-acharya guru-paramparaa traditions ?



It seems to me that there is a clear necessity for review of Bhagavadgita understanding as ‘ Yoga Shaastra’ ; and connect it to Patanjali Yoga Sutra properly, before venturing out on Brahma Sutra –Vedanta –Prasthana Traya based Socio-Religious Identities and Vada-vivada –Samvada . I have made some efforts in developing this approach in my teaching courses and found a path that needs to be explored meticulously. That is Samskrutham teams need to find out and restore the ‘Vak-Yoga’ tradition indicated in Patanjali Mahabhashya (
Padena Vaachaam rogam yah apaakarot, tam patanjalim aanatosmi). 





Would the current Vedanta sampradaya schools be courageous enough to explore a possibility of Vedanta ‘ primary ideology –approach’ reflected in seed form in ‘Patanjali Yoga-Sutra 4-34’ ??? and acknowledge debt to Ashtanga yoga (2-27) practice recommendation with Ishwara Pranidhana ( Yoga Sutra 2-1) ?
