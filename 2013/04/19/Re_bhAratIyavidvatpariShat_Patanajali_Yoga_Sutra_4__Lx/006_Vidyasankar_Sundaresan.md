I think there need be no doubt that there were other traditions of Yoga that have not come down through time. In brahmasUtrabhAshya 2.1.3, Sankara bhagavatpAda quotes अथ तत्त्वदर्शनोपायो योगः. It hasoften been remarked that thisreads like the beginning of a lost yogasUtratext, which is obviously not patanjali's text that is extant today. Of course, the brahmasUtra bhAshya quotes at least two other sUtra-s that are present in the pAtanjala text as well (YS 1.6 is quoted under BS 2.4.12 and YS 2.44 is quoted under BS 1.3.33).



As for variant readings within a text, one should reallyplace great emphasis on manuscript evidence, especially considering that the threads of oral transmission have been so deeply affected as to become almost extinct. Sadly, I don't see much inclination anywhere, whether in India or abroad, whether in university circles or in traditional scholar community circles, to engage in the necessaryeffort.



Finally, as for the yoga - vedanta historical timelines, I think the broaddetails are in place and that is the best that we can do or is even necessary. Legends that seek to make patanjali a direct guru of Sankaraneed not be given historical credence.They may make for charming kAvyas, but not much else. Similarly with the history of the language and its grammar. patanjali of the yoga tradition and patanjali of vyAkaraNa are usually equated only in a legendary fashion, not in a historical sense.



Best regards,
