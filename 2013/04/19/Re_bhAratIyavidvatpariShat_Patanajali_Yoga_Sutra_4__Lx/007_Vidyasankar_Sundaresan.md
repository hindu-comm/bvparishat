Dear Dr. Sastry,



I would like to respond to the last point you make below, namely,



"Would the current Vedanta sampradaya schools be courageous enough to explore a possibility of Vedanta ‘ primary ideology –approach’ reflected in seed form in ‘Patanjali Yoga-Sutra 4-34’ ??? and acknowledge debt to Ashtanga yoga (2-27) practice recommendation with Ishwara Pranidhana ( Yoga Sutra 2-1) ?"



The situation as I see it, is as follows. The traditional advaita vedAnta sampradAya does acknowledge the yoga darsana in more ways than one. Right in the SAnkara sUtrabhAshya as well as the bRhadAraNyaka bhAshya, one can find direct references to the yogasUtra-s, with positive textual citations being made, as well as discussions on the definition of yoga as nirodha of cittavRtti. The gItAbhAshya describes theamAnitvAdi qualities in the 13th chapter as yama and niyama, offering justification for why they are praised as jnAna.One doesn't have to search very hard to find positive references to all eight angas of yoga in the gItAbhAshya and one cannot dismiss all of these as being merely motivated by the source text itself. A careful reader will notice that Sankara's interpretations involving yogaoften go much beyond what the bare text of the gItA requires.His disciple, sureSvara, the vArttikakAra, highly recommends yogAbhyAsa after initiation into saMnyAsa and the resultant inward focus of the citta asa necessary step in the rise of advaita jnAna (naishkarmyasiddhi 1.52).In later times, vidyAraNyasvAmin is so liberal in making references to yoga that he has been labeled a "yogic advaitin" by academic scholars. Andamong the contemporary manifestations of vedAnta that are based on the advaita monastic tradition, none can fault the followers of Swami Vivekananda or Swami Sivananda or Paramahamsa Yogananda for not acknowledging an indebtedness to yoga. Indeed, these newer offshoots of the tradition get labeled as "neo-Vedanta" and are criticized for overly relying on yoga texts and personal experiences of samAdhi over a rigorous emphasis on theprasthAna traya texts.



Incidentally, you may recall that Paul Hacker and those who follow his lead describe Sankara himself has been described as a yogin who became an advaitin, thereby "explaining away" any and all influences of yoga on the main bhAshya texts. Meanwhile, many texts that are attributed to Sankara are rejected as non-genuine,precisely because they reveal influences of yoga (from the perspective of those who reject thus, not necessarily from the perspective of traditionalists). To make a long analysis short, let me just conclude by saying that this kind ofproblem between yoga and vedAnta seems to exist not so much for the traditional advaita vedAntin as much as for outsiders looking in. I cannot presume to comment about non-advaita schools in this regard, but to the best of my knowledge, the traditional leaders of these other vedAnta sampradAyas also commend yoga in multiple contexts and rely on yogasUtras as well as other yoga texts.



Not to indulge in self-promotion here, but I have addressed this issuein quite some detail ina chapter that I have contributed to the book, Yoga: The Indian Tradition, ed. Ian Whicher andDavid Carpenter, Routledge Curzon (2003), and also in my paper on textual authenticityin Philosophy East and West (2000).



Best regards,

Vidyasankar
