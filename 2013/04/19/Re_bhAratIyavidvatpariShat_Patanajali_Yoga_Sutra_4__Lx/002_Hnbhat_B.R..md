Both the date of Patanjali (and his identification with the author of Mahabhashya, and Carakasamhita) and Vyasa (the author of Bhashya on YogasUtra) is debated for long and yet no conclusion except believing in guru parampara (asmadacaryaparyanta - obviously taking his own guru as the last evedince and final one), has arrived at. And on the variants, a critical Edition is necessary of the text and the commentary of Vyasa, on YS is necessary before jumping into any evidence of oldest reading. In the absence of which, the available reading in the Vyasabhashya could be accepted from a scholar's view and also accepting Vyasa as our guru, in the guruparampara.

  

So it could not be resolved finally by some glimpses on the readings. In both the meaning could be arrived. citi samjnane, citi smrtyam, cittam cit and also probably citi. from the same root. The difference between the readings will depend on the context and the commentaries on the reading.
