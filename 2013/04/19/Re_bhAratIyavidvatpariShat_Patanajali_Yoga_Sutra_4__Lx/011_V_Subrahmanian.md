Maybe this sutra gives a clue to the existence of a tradition before Patanjali:  
  
स पूर्वेषामपि गुरुः कालेनानवच्छेदात्॥२६॥ sa eṣaḥ pūrveṣām api guruḥ kālena anavacchedāt sa = sah – He; eṣaḥ – this particular person; pūrveṣām – of those before, previous authorities, the ancient teachers; api – even; guruḥ – the spiritual teacher; kālena – by time; anavacchedāt – unconditioned.
