नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

Here the question is not what I want. The question is what the sutra is capable of giving out as (a) lingusitic construction per se (b) As Intrinsic harmony of the text (c) As understood in the Yoga-Shastra tradition (d) As understood by other Shaastra-darshanas for making the aakshepa and rejecting \<etena yogaH pratuktaH> ?  

  

This is the style (शैली) of शास्त्रम् - ’you want' means 'if the opponent insists on the other reading' .

As has been exhibited , both , प्रथमा and पञ्चमी , thru भेद and अभेद , mean the same .

  

ओमित्येकाक्षरं ब्रह्म - शब्दार्थयोः तादात्म्यम् - ओम् = ब्रह्म (भेदे सति अभेदाध्यवसायः- शब्दस्य वाचकः अर्थः इति भेदः -

  

तादात्म्यं च तद्भिन्नत्वे सति तदभेदेन प्रतीयमानत्वम् (मञ्जूषा)

  

तस्य वाचकः प्रणवः (यो सू) - अत्र भेदेन वस्तुप्रदर्श्नम् - वाच्यवाचकभावः।

  

वृद्धिरादैच् (पाणिनि 1-1-1) - आदैचः वृद्धिपदाभिन्नाः / वृद्धिपदम् आदैचां वाचकः ।

  

If we strictly follow योगानुशासनम् - शब्द एव अर्थः , अर्थ एव ज्ञानम् , ज्ञानमेव शब्दः -- गौरिति शब्दः , गौरित्यर्थः, गौरिति ज्ञानम् --

  

शब्दार्थप्रत्ययानामितरेतराध्यासात् सङ्करः तत्प्रविभागसंयमात् सर्वभूतरुतज्ञानम् (यो सू 3-17)

So in any case we can justify the Sutra.

  

I have already quoted Samkarabhasyam on ’एतेन योगः प्रत्युक्तः’ - that does not mean that altogether योगानुशासनम् is rejected - the प्रधानम् / प्रकृति is not acceptable - rather since श्रुति says - श्रोतव्यो मन्तव्यो निदिध्यासितव्यः , one should go for योग ।

  

  

The concept of \<Purushasya eva, na tu PrakruteH> - equally applies to Prakruti part also. \<PrakruteH swaroopa-pratishThaa = Purushasya Kaivalyam \> ?! Only the question would be :Is Praakruti the \<active agent - swatantraH kartaa/kartree> . Once Purusha-Prakruti samyoga is resolved - i.e. 100% separation of Purusha from entanglement with Prakruti, it also means 100% Prarkuti is \< Established in it self = prakruteH swa-roop-pratishthaa \>. May be that is not the traditonal view, holding on to the ' purusha-kartRutva' approach. In which case, Prakruti - following the Tantra Or the Maayaa model, frees the Purusha from her holds (Eg ; Devi saptashati : harinetra-krutaalayaa maayaa ..)

The 'Purusha Moksha/Kaivalya' - statement is an image of Prarkruti moksha' also.Both ned to occur simultaneously. It is not Purusha Kaivalya and Prarkuti in bandhana.

  

It is clearly stated - पुरुषार्थशून्यानां गुणानां प्रतिप्रसवः - Gunas , without पुरुषार्थ , merged in प्रकृति/प्रधानम् । प्रकृति has got परिणामनित्यता - तत्त्वं विहन्यते ।

  

Once प्रकृति got separated , पुरुष became केवलः and he is कूटस्थनित्यः - तत्त्वं न विहन्यते - and we are concerned about such a मोक्ष , not
प्रकृति any longer.

  

Here one should take individual cases , because the संसार is अनादि and it continues like that --

  

Mimamsakas won't accept प्रलय , Vedantins do , but again there will be सृष्टि ।

  

  

  

Please explain. If i translate this sentence, it appears like \<Kaivalya is swaroopa-pratishThaa of Chitishakti> ; and what is \<chitishakti> ? Why not just \<chiteH> ? What is the difference between kevalaa chit and \< shaktimat - Chit>  

  

The fact is that -- शक्तिः कारकम् is the सिद्धान्त -- परशुना छिनत्ति - it is not the द्रव्यम् , परशु , that is cutting , rather it is the शक्ति that is there in the द्रव्यम्, परशु \|

  

’ शक्तिशक्तिमतोः अभेदः’ - in other words द्रव्यम् and शक्ति are not different .

  

  

Here , there is a difficulty within yoga-sutra text itself. The word \< Kaivlyam> is defined in two other sutras earlier as below:



कैवल्यम् in गुणाधिकारसमाप्ति is said earlier . Now कैवल्यस्वरूपम् is clearly stated - this is the difference - Sastras run like this - tackling different aspects from different angles.

  

  

Why? How? What is \< chitishakti> beyond a \< vRutti> in relation to \<Jeeva> in Yoga sutra ?



Is Jeeva -bhAva same as ' a \<Chitta-vRutti-sthti>, a shell mode, a
koha / aavaraNa -  where in a deeper, yet specific yoga of Purusha-Prakrutiis yielding a \<sva-roopa> in terms of Yoga-sutra 1-4: tada draShTuH swa-roope avashtanam ; 1-3 : vRutti sAroopyam itaratra> is operating> ?



Given the fact that in the Yoga-sutra, the word \<chitta> is not defined ?



चित्तम् is मनस् , it need not be defined - it is there in जीव --

  

व्यासभाष्यम् (1-2) - चित्तं हि प्रख्याप्रवृत्तिस्थितिशीलत्वात् त्रिगुणम् - it is the resort of सत्त्व, रजस् and तमस् ।

  

1-4 is the same as 4-34 - see the व्यासभाष्यम् - स्वरूपप्रतिष्ठा तदानीं चितिशक्तिः यथा कैवल्ये ।

  

What is already in \<vRutti> is not a limiting facotr for the wide meaning and scope of the sutra itself ? Mahabhshya points to this primacy of sutra over interpretation. The original meaning construction is within the context of Yoga-sutra text; The Bhashya is a next level recourse.



'व्याख्याअनतो विशेषप्रतिपत्तिः न हि सन्देहादलक्षणम्’ - this norm (परिभाषा) applies in every Sastra - there has been अविच्छिन्नगुरुशिष्यपरंपरा and we depend on that .If one is capable enough he may go for further interpretation/elaboration . The above परिभाषा is quoted by Patanjali in Mahabhasyam.

  

\< Against the tenets of yogasutram, as understood> - Yes. But the question is : Is the interpretation consistent within the Sutra context itslef ?



If one line of yoga-sutra interpreters 9like interpreters of Brahma sutra rejeted the other view, that is fine. It does not rule out the valid possibility from sutra itself.

  

There is no comparison between Brahmasutras and Yogasutras in terms of interpretation and it is obvious .

Why should \<gati-samAsa> option be ruled out here? technically ??

  

रूढशब्द is already discussed in other threads - -

  

प्रकृष्टा वीणा यस्य सः प्रवीणः - is the derivative meaning - यौगिकार्थः । But it is popularly used in the sense of निपुणः - so प्रवीणः is a रूढशब्द - रूढिः = प्रसिद्धिः।

  

कुशान् लाति इति कुशलः -- but it is popularly used in the sense of निपुणः।

  

तैलं पिबतीति तैलपायिका = cockroach - it never sucks oil .

  

'गतिश्च’ (1-4-59) is a संज्ञा given to प्रादयः(प्रादय उपसर्गाः क्रियायोगे 1-4-58) , कुगतिप्रादयः(2-2-18) is the समासविधायकसूत्रम् --

  

examples -- व्याकरणम् , न्यायः etc.
