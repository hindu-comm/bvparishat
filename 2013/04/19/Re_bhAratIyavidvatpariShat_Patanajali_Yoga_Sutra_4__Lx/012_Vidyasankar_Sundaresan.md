\>

\> 1. Do I take that you are pointing from the specific references below that Advaita schools have specific model of ‘Yoga-Practice Acceptance included in the Siddhanta and abhyasa –anushthana’; but the Yoga as a ‘Shastra’ ending at the ‘ Purusha-Prakruti’ border is what is rejected ?

\>

\> It is here that I have a question.

\>

\> IF \<Gita was a tradition of Yoga Shastra> for centuries beyond Patanjali and a \< derivative of Veda-Upanishads> heralding \< Vednata of all three flavors>; and categorically substantiated and aligned by the Brahma-Sutra discussions ( which would be way before a historic date of Patanjali> 

\>

\> THEN  (a) How can Yoga sutra ascribed to Patanjali, be constructed to project a different stream of Yoga teaching, to be rejected  under \< etena yogah pratyuktah>  and in the same breath, in a different chapter pick a preferred interpretation of yoga and include it as ‘yoga-vedanta sampradaya’ ? ‘ vedanta- vijnana –sunishitaarthah, sannyasa-yogaat yatayah shuddha satvah, te brahma loke tu paraanta-kaale, paraamrutaat parimuchyante sarve’ ? - is it a medley of concepts ?? 

\>



A careful reading of the शाङ्करभाष्य under एतेन योगः प्रत्युक्तः shows that the rejection of Yoga within the seminal construction of advaita vedAnta as a दर्शन is only partial. He explicitly says, about both Samkhya and Yoga, येनांशेन न विरुध्येते तेनेष्टमेव. The rest of this passage lays down in what sense a virodha exists and in what sense there is no virodha between non-dualistic vedAnta (based on the prasthAna traya source texts) and the firmly dualistic Samkhya and Yoga trends of thought (based on smRti texts and the yukti of individual thinkers of these schools). At least as far as advaita is concerned, what is rejected is (a) a plurality of purusha-s and (b) an ultimately real and distinct existence of prakRti. All other aspects where common ground can be found are indeed acceptable, under the nyAya, परमतमप्रतिषिद्धमनुमतं भवति(cited just before quoting yogasUtra 1.6). Commenting on the gItA allows Sankara an opportunity to do a higher order synthesis, while the bRhadAraNyaka line आत्मेत्येवोपासीत allows a discussion on howनिष्ठा in advaita jnAna is itself the only sure means to nirodha of citta-vRtti.



What comes across as a medley of concepts is theपूर्वपक्ष presented by the pre-Sankaran vedAntin, whoproposes to apply the Purva Mimamsa conception of vidhi to the Yoga goal of cittavRtti nirodha and wants to read the Upanishads as if they enjoin cittavRtti nirodha as a means to moksha. This medley of disparate concepts is rejected in the discussion under आत्मेत्येवोपासीत, based on a corethesis from the same Upanishads,namely that the AtmA is already existent, is always present in any cognition (even by the one who calls himself an ajnAnI)and is not a result of any action. So, in the advaita vedAnta interpretation,there can beno vidhito realizeone's ownself, except in a veryfigurative sense. The advaitin's rejection of Purva Mimamsa in these matters is much more striking than any rejection of Yoga under एतेन योगः प्रत्युक्तः. For non-advaita schools, which do not quite see the non-agency of the self in the same way, there can surely be other ways to acknowledge the concepts and practices of Yoga.



So, at least to me, it is clear that not only were there probably multiple traditions of Yoga, there were also multiple traditions of vedAnta since ancient times. What Sankara and his disciples consolidated is one of those traditions. The later developments of non-advaita sampradAyas of vedAnta certainly picked up on lines of thought that probably had been preservedwithin small communities that held on to them, if eclipsed forfew centuriesby theappeal of advaita vedAnta.



\> The logical options open are :

\>

\> 

\>

\> (a) There were many yoga traditions with many concluding positions
on what is ‘Samadhi –Kaivalya –swaroopa pratishtha’ as final attainable, progressively, from yoga-anushaasana - abhyasa.  Does these concepts map fully to the ‘Moksha /Atma Jnana /Brahma jnana’ – the pole star concepts of Upanishads held by Vedanta schools ? ; Each Acharya sampradaya seems to have picked what stream of yoga would benefit their final stand as ‘Siddhanta’.

\>

\> 

\>

\> (b)  The yoga-Sutra-kaara might have a projected a distinct yoga postulate from Gita and Upanishads – as a common set acceptable to all samprdayas ; which puts Patanjali as Yoga-Sutra-Kaara ( and commentators of this text) making it a unique stream of Sarva- Shaastra –darshana –anushaasana ? Even when it was not gelling with vedanta sampradaya . 

\>

\> 

\>

\> Fine and so what ? YogaSutra is not dependent on any inheritance legacy texts or revelation ; YS is not mentioning or drawing any recourse to Upanishads and Gita or Brahma Sutras . The word swadhyaya can be stand alone and interpreted as study of one s own sacred text /Study of ‘self ( =sva)/stud by self ( svatah, svasya adhyaayah); which Is perfectly in hamony with Vedanta as ‘Shaareeraka darshana’ . 

\>



Yogasutra does have Agama as one of thepramANa-s. That it is not so heavily dependent on Sruti is precisely what can allow vedAnta schools to incorporate as much or as little of Yoga as needed for their paths to moksha.



\> 

\>

\> Does this situation make ‘yoga-Sutra’ as a ‘Practical of Brahma Sutra’ :: The Anushaasana sampradaya  for a Jijnaasaa –meemaamsaa paramparaa ? What is the undercurrent of this between Patanjali and Acharya Shankara ? You have pointed the Post Shankara continuity and blend of this till Vdyaranya.

\>



I look at this in a slightly different way. Rather than thinking of vedAnta texts as theory and yoga texts as practical manuals, what happens in the advaita paramparA circles is that the brahmasUtra derived line of thinking is about organizing scripture in order tostudy it, while the yogasUtra and other texts pertain to the personal requirements that lead to fruition. Ultimately, all said and done, as far as someone searching for liberation is concerned, the jnAna conveyed by a text, even as exalted as the veda, needs to become one's own personal, non-mediated jnAna.



And again, the utility of yoga study and practice for the purposes of vedAnta is acknowledged right in the brahmasUtra bhAshya, under the adhikaraNa beginning withआसीनः सम्भवात्, with a comment that padma and other Asana-s are taught so as to enablea jijnAsu's sAdhana.



\> 

\>

\> c) Where did we loose the stream of studying Bhagavad-Gita as a Yoga-Shaastra, in India, in shaastra-sampradaya schools, in the prior period, before the segmented popularization of Yoga in west by the yoga-gurus and making Gita as a four-yoga stream lane ?  and then a religious text of Hinduism ? 

\>



Within traditional circles, we have never lost it, I would think. This problem really afflicts those among us who are, in Agehananda Bharati's words, subject to the "pizza effect". A large number of us Indians, from the communities that should have sustained these traditions through the last couple of centuries, suffer from a complex that values our own only after it comes back to us, with "value-added" pricing, from America or Europe. And it has to come backfrom white-skinned folk, for the value to be perceived, not necessarily from Indians who have emigrated to these continents. This is a hard fact of contemporary Indian reality, which we would do well to acknowledge and address.
