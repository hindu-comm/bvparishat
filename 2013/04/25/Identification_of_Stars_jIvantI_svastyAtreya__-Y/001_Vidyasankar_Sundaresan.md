For what it is worth, among the Rgveda khila mantra-s, thereare two that are appended tothe svasti sUkta (beginning with svasti no mimItAm aSvinA bhagaH... ). The secondkhila mantrabegins अँहोमुचमाङ्गिरसं गयं च स्वस्त्यात्रेयंमनसा च तार्क्ष्यं.



The reference here seems to be to the Atreya who is called Gaya. The word svastioccurs repeatedly and stands by itself in these khila mantras. They aretypically appended to the four mantras beginning with svasti no mimItAm aSvinA bhagaH... and are called the svasti sUkta of the Rgveda.
