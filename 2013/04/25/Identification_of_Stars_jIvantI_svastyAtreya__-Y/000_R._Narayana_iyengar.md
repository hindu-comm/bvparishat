Dear Scholars,

  

In my search for ancient Vedic asterisms I came across the above two stars in the मानव & काठक grhya sutras. This is similar to the ArundhatI, Dhruva-darshana on the marriage night. The above two stars are extra for KaThaas. The exact statement is:

अस्तमिते अग्निं जीवन्तीं ध्रुवं स्वस्त्यात्रेयं दर्शयति अरुन्धतींच \| एतेषां एकैकं पश्यसीत्याह पश्यामीति प्रत्याह \|\|

  

This is very interesting because the bride has to answer back to have seen each star.

  

Five stars are mentioned here. I can identify agni, dhruva and arundhati of the Vedic period. Is there mention of the other two in any other text including Grammar texts? (MW does not identify the stars. AVP names svastyaatreya but which star is this?)

  

thanks 

  

RN Iyengar
