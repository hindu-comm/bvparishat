Dear Dr. Kulkarni,  
  
The Dvaitanirṇaya of Vācaspatimiśra is available for download from DLI.
It was edited by Parameshvar Sharma and was published from Darbhanga in Samvat 1965. I downloaded this book a few months ago, and it should be possible for anyone to search for it on DLI and download it. I have checked all the 167 pages of it (and this is an incomplete book), and it is clear that this is a book on Dharmaśāstra dealing with topics like Dāna, Snāna, Śrāddha etc. and has absolutely nothing to do with philosophy of Dvaita, either for or against it. But if you are interested in its Dharmaśāstra contents, you can download and read it.
With best regards,
