Namaste  
  
Can anyone pl. give us an idea of what the work 'DvaitanirNaya' is about? Is it talking about Dvaita siddhAnta and the method of arriving at the siddhAnta?  
  
In the PanchadashI of Swami Vidyaranya there is a chapter 4 titled 'dvaitavivekaH' . It delineates the vyAvahArika prapancha by distinguishing between IshakRtadvaitam and jIvakRtadvaitam and specifies that bandha is due to the latter. At the end we have this verse:  
  
जीवन्मुक्तेः पराकाष्ठा जीवद्वैतविवर्जनात् ।  
लभ्यतेऽसावतोऽत्रेदमीशद्वैताद्विवेचितम् ॥ ६१ ॥  
  
Since from the title 'DvaitanirNayaH' we are not able to make out anything it would be helpful to have some information of its contents/method.
