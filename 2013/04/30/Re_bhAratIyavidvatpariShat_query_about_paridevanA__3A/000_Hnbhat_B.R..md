I don't think it is a wise research looking for astrological meanings in any text not at all related to astrology in anyt waty simply you want to do research and find out something new.  
  
  

the present meaning is coherent with the context of philosopy religion, ethics related with BG as our gurus who commented on it. Now twisting the meaning to suit your purpose is not at all considered a faith research.
