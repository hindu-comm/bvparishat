I came across some more शाब्दबोध examples recently, and now I think the earlier शाब्दबोध that I gave can be improved. The three improvements are

1\. The statement has both या सा which need to be reflected in the शाब्दबोध by the use of यदभिन्न and तदभिन्न

2.लङ् लकार is used in the first part, which denotes अनद्यतन भूत and not simply भूत

3\. The कर्तृ of the first व्यापार is better written as व्यापाराश्रय rather than व्यापारकर्तृ. In the Vyakarana शाब्दबोध tradition, the कर्तृ is called व्यापाराश्रय while कर्म is called फलाश्रय

  

So for the first statement -

या उषसि सामगानमगायत्सा बाला गुरुकुले पठति

The improved शाब्दबोध is

  

यदभिन्नैककर्तृक­सामगानकर्मकानद्यतनभूतकालावच्छिन्न­गानानुकूलव्यापाराश्रयाभिन्न­तद्बालाभिन्नैककर्तृक­गुरुकुलाधिकरणक­वर्तमानकालावच्छिन्न­पठनानुकूलव्यापारः

  

For the second statement -  

  

या बाला उषसि सामगानमगायत्सा गुरुकुले पठति

The improved शाब्दबोध is

  

यद्बालाभिन्नैककर्तृक­सामगानकर्मकानद्यतनभूतकालावच्छिन्न­गानानुकूलव्यापाराश्रयाभिन्न­तदभिन्नैककर्तृक­गुरुकुलाधिकरणक­वर्तमानकालावच्छिन्न­पठनानुकूलव्यापारः  

  

To me, the difference in the two statements is thus. The first implies that the only one female agent (yā) who was involved in the past action of singing the Sāmagāna in the morning, and who is the same as "that girl" (sā bālā), studies/recites in the Gurukula. The second statement may mean that multiple agents (e.g. one girl + one or more boys + one or more grown-ups) may have been involved in the past action of singing the Sāmagāna in the morning. Among those one or more agents, the only girl agent (yā bālā), who is the same as "that" (sā), studies/recites in the Gurukula.

  

Note that an exact English translation is not possible here as English would use only one pronoun in such a case, e.g. "He who laughs last, laughs best".
