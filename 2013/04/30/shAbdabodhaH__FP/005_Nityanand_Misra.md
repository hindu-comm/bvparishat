Let me be even more explicit. In this context, what exactly is this modifier or विशेष्य-विशेषण relationship? It is अभिन्नता. अभिन्नता can only occur between two agents (कर्त्ताs). An action (व्यापार) cannot be अभिन्न from an agent (कर्त्ता) because the two are fundamentally different concepts. Any विशेष्य-विशेषण relation can only take place betweenविशेष्य and विशेषण- one cannot have a "blue voice" or "deafening colour", and the "colour of a flower" cannot be अभिन्न from the "frequency of a shrill". Whenever we have a modifier in the context of अभिन्नता like - *Y which is अभिन्न from X*, X and Y should be of the same type.

  

Which is why I gave a Samasa like Vyaapara1 -> Karta1 -> Abhinna Karta -> Vyaapaara 2. Your earlier construct had something like Karta1 -> Vyaapara1 -> Abhinna Karta -> Vyaapaara 2, which made the first action (व्यापार) a direct modifier of and अभिन्न from the second agent (कर्त्ता) which I see as incorrect.

  

So the relation between first action and second agent is not direct but indirect, captured through the first agent.

Even though वाचनम् is णिजन्त and पठनम् is not, still वाचनम् = पठनम् is the common meaning. You may refer the Sabdakalpadrumah under

<http://archive.org/stream/sabdakalpadrumah04devauoft#page/320/mode/1up> and also the Vachaspatyam under <http://archive.org/stream/vacaspatyam06tarkuoft#page/472/mode/1up>.
अनुवाचन, पुण्याहवाचन, स्वस्तिवाचन are examples where the meaning is पठनम्=recitation (and not necessarily causing to recite).

  

There may be a Varttika or Sutra covering thisस्वार्थ णिच् usage.
