Respected scholars,

Namast.

I did come across a text titled: Gīta-purāņa, which has been mentioned in the context of the episode of Gajendramokșa, while reading a portion of śivadharma corpus. I am curious to know about the existence of such a text. Therefore I request the scholars of this group to enlighten me on this matter.
