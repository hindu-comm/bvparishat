Please see attached श्रीराघवकृपाभाष्यम् (1998) by जगद्गुरु रामन्दाचार्य स्वामी रामभद्राचार्य on बृहदारण्यक उपनिषद् 1-3. I do not have the commentary by करपात्र स्वामी with me now.  
  
Trivia: In his पूर्वाश्रम in 1970s, स्वामी रामभद्राचार्य knew करपात्र स्वामी very well. In his 1976 चतुर्मास, करपात्र स्वामी requested for and heard 60 discourses on a single चौपाई of रामचरितमानस (लोचन मग रामहि उर लानी, दीन्हें पलक कपाट सयानी) by स्वामी रामभद्राचार्य (then known as गिरिधरलाल मिश्र).
