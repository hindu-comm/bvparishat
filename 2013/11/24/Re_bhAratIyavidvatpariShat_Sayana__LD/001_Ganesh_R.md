Deasr Sirs,  
  

SaayaNa was not Maadhavaachaarya, the master archetect of the mighty empire Vijayanagar. Maadhava was his elder brother and later he only got initiated in to saMnyaasa and became the great VidyaaraNya, who authored well known works like the panchadashi, jeevanmuktivivEka, anubhUtiprakaasha, vaiyaasakanyaayamaalaavistara etc., Infact I have written a research work in Kannada titled 'vibhUtipuruSha VidyaaraNya' where one can as well find the life and aachievements of aacharya saayana too.
