Dear Dr.Bhat,

I raised the issue as a Scholar in Mysore was claiming that Sayana & Madhva(Poorna Prajna) were one and the same. I probably should done a little more basic research before posing the question.My apologies. Wikipedia says Madhva died in 1278 and Sayana in 1387. I also spoke to Dr.Venkataramana Hegde, Prof of Dharma Shastra in Sanskrit College, Mysore who clarified that they are two different people. He said that the confusion arises because of Sayana and his brother Madhava who are understood to have co-authored many works. Also because Sayana's brother was also called Ananda Tirtha as was Madhvacharya. I have seen other posts which name sources of works as Sayana/Madhavacharya. It is quite clear that Sayana and Madhva, the founder of the Dvaita school are two different people. I understand Sayana and his brother Madhavacharya were Advaitins.

Regards,

  

Dr.V.R.Anil Kumar
