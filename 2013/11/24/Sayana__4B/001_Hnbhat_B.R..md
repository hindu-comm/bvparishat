This topic could not have been possibly discussed in any forum not only this one.

  

सायण माधव and सायणाचार्य the commentators, between the two brothers had been discussed and Mr. Ganesh R has made out a paper on the identitity. Some hold both are different identities while some hold सायणाचार्य and माधवाचार्य are two brothers, one of whom is a writer and the other administrator. The question of identity between the two have been discussed in several forums.

  

But it is for the first time, the question of identity between मध्वाचार्य, the founder of द्वैत philosophy and the सायणमाधव, the commentator on Veda-s has been raised. Please provide for your assumption. Both have written commentaries on Veda-s.
