mAdhava, the brother of sAyaNa,is usually identified with vidyAraNya, a key advaita vedAntin, although this identification is open to dispute as well. This mAdhava has never been given a saMnyAsi name of AnandatIrtha by any traditional source. As such, this person could never have been the same as madhvAcArya,the founder of dvaita vedAnta.



However, please note that the mAdhava-madhva confusion is not a new one at all.Max Weber (1864 - 1920) is one of the founders of the field called sociology, who has wielded great influence in research on humanities and social sciences across the world. His book, The Religion of India: The Sociology of Hinduism and Buddhism, was published in 1916 (German), translated into English in 1958 and most recently brought out again by Munshiram Manoharlal in 2007. If you read through Weber's work, it will be clear that he thought madhva, the vaishNava teacher of dvaita vedAnta, was the same as mAdhava, the brother of sAyaNa and/or author of works such as parASara-mAdhavIya. It is this kind of blatant error in the works of such celebrated scholars that often goes unexamined and repeated as if it were established truth, by scholars from India who really ought to know better. No doubt Weber's book is required reading in sociology departments in all Indian universities. Weber goes on to make rather inflated judgements about the entire thing, based on his colossal confusion.



This mAdhava-madhva confusion was indeed discussed, albeit onlyin passing, on an online forum many years ago. Please see <http://list.indology.info/pipermail/indology_list.indology.info/2000-May/021280.html>, anold post of mine to the Indology mailing listand wade through that thread, if interested.



I would request Dr. Anilkumar to check what is the source for the quoted scholar from Mysore. It seems to me very likely that this person is trained in a modern university, and is perhaps quoting Max Weber, without bothering to check with any credible native source. If so, it is yet another datapoint in support of the much needed decolonization of academia in India. In any case, Mysore is close enough to multiple key centers of both advaita and dvaita that the said scholar doesn't even have to cast a wide netto gain the required corrective information.



Best regards,

Vidyasankar



ps. For those who read the link to the Indology list posting, please note that I label Weber's assertion as "doubly or triply outrageous". I hope it is clear what I mean.
