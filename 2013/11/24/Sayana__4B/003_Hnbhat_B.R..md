Another new thing. Sayana's brother was called Madava as Ananda tirtha, as well as Ananda tirtha the name for Madhva (Founder of of Advaita):

  

<http://www.uttaradimath.org/web/index.php?Itemid=148&id=116&option=com_content&task=view>  

  

The above link in Vikipedia, gives माधव as the another name for Ananda tirtha, the article and the verse published by Uttaradi Muth, which is known as belong to Madhva School makes explicit.

  

Now, it needs evidence where सायण माधव was called as Ananda tirtha. Either by Advaitins or Dvaitins of this forum are called for clearing the assumption. I do not remember anywhere, माधवाचार्य being called as आनन्दतीर्थ. And of dvaita Muthus, one was Established by one माधवतीर्थ ---

  

Madhava-tirtha established a matha at Majjige-halli which developed into an independent branch. In the same way, two branches of Akshobhya-tirtha grew into independent mathas at Kudli and Balegaru.  

  

who is differnent from मध्वाचार्य the founder of द्वैत school as per the same Viki page.

  

Now it is to be established that माधवाचार्य the writer of धातुपाठ and other books independently was also called आनन्दतीर्थ.

  

Scholars are welcome to investigate this claim.
