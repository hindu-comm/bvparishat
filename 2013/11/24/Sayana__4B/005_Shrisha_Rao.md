I don’t recall who exactly has done this, but the names माधव and मध्व are confounded by early Indologists and others. Likewise आनन्दगिरि was famously confounded with आनन्दतीर्थ by A.B. Keith. There is also some confounding of सायणमाधव and वेङ्कटमाधव who both have commented on the RV and may be called just माधव in certain contexts.
