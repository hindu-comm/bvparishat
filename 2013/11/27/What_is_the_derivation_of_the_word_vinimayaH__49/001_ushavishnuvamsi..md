Pranaam!,

1.As the dhaathu मेङ् is ejantha, thelast vovelएhas to be replased byआ when followed by a non-शित् suffix.But we have no such pratyaya in 'bhaave'.For the word vinimaya,a BHAAVA-meaning suffix is needed.By कृञः श च ,शप्रत्ययः is there भावे, but not in the case of वि निमेङ्.So here we have another solution-the same word is made ready(nipaathitham) in dhaathupatha डु क्रीञ् द्रव्यविनिमये. We see the same problem in the word आह्वयः.

2.Or we can say the dhaathuhereisमिञ् orमीञ् with वि नि to get the wanted meaning(धातूनामनेकार्थत्वम्, उपसर्गेण धात्वर्थो बलादन्यत्र नीयते).

3.And why do we worrywhen we have thesootra कृत्यल्युटो बहुलम्?!!  
I prefer the first solution.
