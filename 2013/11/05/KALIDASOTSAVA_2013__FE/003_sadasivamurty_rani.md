The sloka-  

धन्वन्तरिक्षपणकामरसिंहशङ्कुवैतालभट्टघटकर्परकालिदासाः ।

ख्यातो वराहमिहिरो नृपतेः सभायां रत्नानि वै वररुचिर्नव विक्रमस्य ॥

is found in the Astrological text "Jyothirvidabharanam" ascribed to Kalidasa. I have the entire text of Jyotirvidambharanam with me. It is really a great work on astronomy dealing with many wonderful Yogas and other interesting information it.

  

If it was really written by Kaladasa we are greatly indebted to him.

The said sloka "धन्वन्तरिक्षपणक...." etc., is found in it. While drafting this mail as I am in the University I could not see the chapter no. and sloka no. After going home I shall furnish.

Warm Regards,
