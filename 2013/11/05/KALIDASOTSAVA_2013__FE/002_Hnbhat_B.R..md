I am looking for the verse (in Prakrit-Maharashtri as well as transcribed in Sanskrit) in Hala's Gathasaptashati, which mentions the court poet Kalidasa. I shall be thankful if any scholar can quote these verses.

I don't know whether the source of this popular verse enlisting the contemporaries of Kalidasa, in the court of Vikramaditya is from Hala's GathaSaptati or its Sanskrit translation:

  

धन्वन्तरिक्षपणकामरसिंहशङ्कुवैतालभट्टघटकर्परकालिदासाः ।

ख्यातो वराहमिहिरो नृपतेः सभायां रत्नानि वै वररुचिर्नव विक्रमस्य ॥

  

The above verse lists the nine poets as the court poets of Vikramaditya as nine jewels (nava ratna-s).

  

There may be some other verse too mentioning Kalidasa in Hala's गाहासत्तई separately.
