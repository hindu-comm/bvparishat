Baraha*IME* orBaraha Direct is capable of writing using Kannada, English and many other Indian Scripts.

  

It is works in Windows XP well and Unicode fonts are used. Baraha Trial also works in later versions, of Windows, but may not work on Mac OS.

  

Anyhow there are many other IME Softwares to type in several Indian Scripts compatible to different OS.

  

As Mr. Nityananda has suggested, Google Input Tools give different selected IME tools to download.

And for typing in here in the message box, one need not Install any software separately. Just one can enable in the Indian Languages in the Indian Language script 3 at a time, in the Input tools selected. Kannada, Sanskrit, Telugu, Malayalam Tamil are available South Indian Language Scripts along with other North Indian and Wold Language scripts.

  

संस्कृतम् ಸಂಸ್ಕೃತಮ್ సంస్కృతము സoസ്കൃതം சம்ச்க்றுதம்

  

  

The examples are Kannada, Telugu, Malayalam and Tamil language scripts enabled in Input Tools settings in the Inbox and no need to install any software in the Programs Folder in Windows.
