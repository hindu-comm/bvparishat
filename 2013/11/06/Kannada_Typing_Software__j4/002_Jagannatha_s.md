Prakashak is a software in which you can type both Devanagari anda fewIndian scripts including Kannada, Telugu etc..This is very simple and closely follows Ananta Keaboard(typing) system. Unfortunately, it does not have Unicode system. You can workin Windows XP using this software on Aldus Pagemaker 5 but not word or Adobe Pagemaker 6.5. But you can open the files of Aldus Pagemaker 5 in Word and Adobe Pagemaker 6.5

In Mysore (barring a few exceptions), all the printing institutes havebeen using this software.

This software is created by Sonata company.

Since the fonts are very beautiful(like Praja in Kannada) in this software,the software engineers are requested to create any link software (or unicode)so thatone can work with it on Windows 7 or higher versions.
