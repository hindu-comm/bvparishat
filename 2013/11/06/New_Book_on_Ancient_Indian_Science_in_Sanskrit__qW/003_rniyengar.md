Dear Dr.Basu,

Thanks for your interest in the book. It will be released on 30th of this month and should be available outside Bangalore almost immediately. Please send a mail to the publisher mentioned in my previous post. This could be just an expression of interest, with no commitment to buy. This would help the publisher know how to distribute the book. Publishing and marketing Indology/Sanskrit books within India appears to be a tough proposal! \[My previous book, a collection of papers, is sitting with a well known Delhi Publisher after 2 years and three proofs. Reason: He is demanding money from me and I will not oblige him.\]

Hence my request.

  

Best Regards

  

RN Iyengar
