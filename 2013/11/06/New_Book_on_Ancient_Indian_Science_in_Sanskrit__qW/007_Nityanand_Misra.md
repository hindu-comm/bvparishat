Not a PhD \[yet\], so you may drop the Dr. :)

No my point is not that only Devanagari is to be used for writing Samskrita. My point is whatever script, Indic or western (using a transliteration scheme), is used to write Samskrita, the Samskrita words should be written the way they are pronounced in Samskrita. Consistent and accurate representation/transliteration, in any script.  
  
So instead of using तंत्र/તંત્ર/ತಂತ್ರ etc which is the practice for works in Prakrits (for whatever historical reasons), works in Samskrita should use the representation तन्त्र/તન્ત્ર/ತನ್ತ್ರ when printed in Nagari/Gujarati/Kannada script. Even in works of older presses, we do not see the latter forms in standard publications like those of Nirnay Sagar Press.  
  
Another example - the front inner cover flap of the book has IAST transliteration for Samskrita names at some places - Parāśara, Varāhamihira, Ballālasena. But in the same flap at other places the scheme is different - e.g. Parasara (for Parāśara) and Bhaskara (for Bhāskara). Same page uses two different transliterations for the same name - Parasara (परसर) and Parāśara (पराशर) - at two places. These errors are no doubt minor, but easy to detect. These are things all proofreaders are expected to detect and correct, and all authors are expected to pay attention to.  
  
I recall an incident in this regard. When the great scholar Acharya Hazariprasad Dwivedi was on his deathbed, his work सिक्ख गुरुओं का पुण्यस्मरण was not yet printed. He regretted that he would die (of brain tumour) before the book would be published. His last words to his son Mukund Dwivedi about the work were "Do not get it published yet. I could not see the typed manuscript. There should be no printing mistakes. Match all citations with Guru Grantha Sahib, either you do this yourself or ask Vishvanath (Vishvanath Tripathi) to do it. I do not know if I will live to see this published." I think that is what all authors and proofreaders should strive for - avoid as many errors as we can.  
  
Regards, Nityanand
