Valuable addition, indeed, Nityanand,

  

 I must confess I value your detailed critical remarks a lot. Even if there is not love between us. I value you as a scholar, an eagle-eyed one.

Right. This is a huge issue in India, but in Ayurvedic books it's really bad. Almost impossible to find correct IAST, everything is mixed.

Did not knew about the Prakrit practice, very interesting. I deal with the same issue, correcting an old edition of a Sanskrit-Russian dictionary. Some words go anusvaram way, some go the correct nasal way. Both together - a mess.

Yes, this is simple, yet so many authors fail to detect it. These are simple, yet very wise words. If IAST - always IAST. If anglicized Sanskrit, always anglicized Sanskrit. Never a mix. That poison can kill even an elephant.

Yes, stories like that I've heard even before, but this is so strong. And on the other side there are authors who print books just for the sake of speed of printing. 5 mistakes per page on topics like Sanskrit - no, even if the author is a good person, it is not how books should be made.
