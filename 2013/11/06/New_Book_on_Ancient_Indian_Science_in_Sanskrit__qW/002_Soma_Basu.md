Respected Prof. Iyenger,

Many thanks for this text on Ancient Indian Astronomy you reconstructed.  
I have great interest in reconstructed texts as we have been working with manuscripts in our department since long.

May I know when will it be available for the readers?  
Regards,

Dr. Mrs. Soma Basu  
Associate Professor  
School of Vedic Studies  
Rabindra Bharati University  
Kolkata
