Jyotish is a very interesting topic. Let us make (typographically) better books than Rao did long ago in his Jaiminisutras. We are palavers. We value grammar and precision. A scientific books with misprints is not a scientific book anymore, it becomes more like a hobby. The listed above issues should be fixed by whatever cost. Otherwise it's not science. Is it?
