History of Dharmashastra (Vol 5 Part 1)by P.V.Kane deals with Vratas in detail(Pp.1-462). A huge list of Vratas with summary of Vratas and source works is printed at the end of this Vrata-chapter(Pp.251-462). Even though adhyayas of the source works are not mentioned, definitely this list facilitates search of Vratas.



(I have not found some names like KSHEERAABDHI-DVAADASHEE in this list)



History of Dharmashastra can be had from archives.
