Dear Sri Vamsi Krishna Ghanapathi Mahodayah!

Namaskarams. All the information pertaining to all these Vratas mentioned in your mail is available in VRATARATNAKARAM Part I and Part II published by Vavilla Press.

The sources of these VRATAS in the said volumes of VRATARATNAKARA are the 18 Maha Puranas. **Skanda purana** in particular has lot of information about many Vratas including Vrata Mahatmya. Besides Skanda purana the other Purnanas like Agni Purana, Vishnu Purana and Narada purana are also of good deal of this subject.

Warm Regards,

**Dr. Rani Sadasiva Murty**
