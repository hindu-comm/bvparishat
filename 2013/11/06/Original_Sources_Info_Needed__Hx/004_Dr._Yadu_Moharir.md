Namaste  
  
Most PuraaNaaa's have variations.  
  
Example::  
  
SatyanaaraataNa puujaa often referenced in the "revaa khanda" of Skandha puraaNaa is found in the Calcutta Edition, however, it is not found in the Anandaashrama editions. This observation is remarked in PV Kane's book on Dharmashastra.  
  
Even such simple observation can mean and provide clues how development or migration of various "vrataa's" may have occurred".  
  
During Peshava period, there is no mention of SatyanarayaNa puujaa. Peshavaa's were extremely particular about maintaining receipts of all the expenses, especially for religious activities.  
  
This effort of cataloging various vrata has a merit only if that is taken in pro historical perspective.  
  
Just my 2 Cents.  
  
Best rgds and Wishes
