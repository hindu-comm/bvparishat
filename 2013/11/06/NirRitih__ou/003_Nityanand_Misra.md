Dear Sh. Vinay Jha

  

At the outset, I would like to thank you for offering new insights on the topic. However, some parts in your argument need further explanation, modification and/or correction.

What is meant by between /i/ and /u/? Do you mean the effort (prayatna) of/R/is between the effort of/i/ and /u/? Or the location (aasya) of/R/is between the location of/i/ and /u/? I cannot accept the latter since 'muurdhaa' is NOT between 'taalu' and 'oshtha'. So please clarify.

This is very helpful and new to me. Can you please quote the original verse in the Pratishakhya (or give the reference) and what commentaries have to say on this, for everybody's benefit? Do other Pratishakhyas do not mention this vowel at all? I have not studied Pratishakhyas in detail, and only have a smattering from Vyakarana works.

I did not understand. What do you mean by "when ऋ is accompanied by अ". As per Sandhi rules ऋ + अ becomes र which is nothing butर् + अ, and the अ sound in this is no different fromअ. So what you are saying above contradicts a grammar rule from pre-Paninian Vedic days. Please clarify.

This is interesting, but again, a citation or reference would help me immensely.

This theory is new to me, and may be true, but what we are missing is the audio. If you can record samples in your voice for how you think the vowel's pure pronunciation is, and how it becameरु or रि, it would help all of us.

This is not true, the symbols for the vowel (ऋ andॠ) and the matras definitely exist in alphabets. Maybe you mean the original sound has no equivalent in Prakrit languages.

Again, between/i/ and /u/ needs explanation. See my question above.

Agree, in the name of Parampara, we do not question our elders. We sayहेतुप्रष्टा तु नास्तिकः. But Manu said long back thatयस्तर्केणानुसन्धत्ते स धर्मं वेद नेतरः. Same should be applied to our texts and oral literature.
