Namaste Nityanand Mishra Ji,



*\> "What is meant by between /i/ and /u/?..."*



I use the vowel diagram of Daniel Jones and representation of International Phonetic Alphabet symbols on it which is accepted norm in modern descriptive linguistics. The vowel diagram used in modern linguistics is based on three characteristics of vowels : tongue height, part of tongue which rises or falls, and degre of lip-roundness. other qualities of vowels are to be memorized and understood, not represented diagrammatically on the vowel diagram. Vowel /i/ is a front vowel in which front part of the tongue rises. Vowel /u/ is a back vowel in which back part of the tongue rises. Midway both means the central vowel. Vowel /a/ (small /a/) is the standard central vowel in all languages, but it is central in all three respects. Due to retroflex (murdhanya) quality of vowel /R/, tongue rises, hence /R/ is not a perfect central vowel, it is central to /i/ and /u/, but it is raised with respect to /a/ due to the act of retroflexion. Exact retroflexion is not represented on the 2-dimensional Vowel Diagram. For perfect representation of all vowels, we need a 3-D Vowel Diagram, but it is not used anywhere. Hence, I used the simple model here which is universally used in modern



*\> "This is very helpful and new to me. Can you please quote the original verse in the Pratishakhya (or give the reference) and what commentaries have to say on this, for everybody's benefit? Do other Pratishakhyas do not mention this vowel at all? I have not studied Pratishakhyas in detail, and only have a smattering from Vyakarana works." *



Studying one's own shaakhaa is a nitya and not a kaamya karma ; for traditional meaning of Svaadhyaaya (स्वाध्याय), see
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sv%C4%81dhy%C4%81ya>



\[ I added the traditional Vedic meaning of svadhyaya since Aug 1, 2007 in Wikipedia which can be seen through HISTORY tab. A member of Eurocentric gang controlling all Indological articles in Wikipedia nicknamed Buddhipriya harassed me for some time but ultimately failed in preventing the traditional Vedic meaning to be included ; now this article is in good shape, further improved by some new contributors ; unfortunately no Indian helped me in Wikipedia which I left editing due to constant harassment and abusing by the Eurocentric gang headed by Dieter Bachman, a follower of Harvard's Michael Witzel). \]



This is the reference from Rk-praatishaakhya (I have checked two versions I possess, both have same wording) :



ऋग्वेदप्रातिशाख्यम्‚ शिक्षापटलं (13) :--

रेफोऽस्त्यृकारे च परस्य चार्धे पूर्वे ह्र्सीयाँस्तु न वेतरस्मात् ।

मध्ये सः तस्यैव लकारभावे धातौ स्वरः कल्पयताव्लृकारः।।



उवट-भाष्य (with notes by translator Dr Virendra Kumar Verma, cf. below) :--



ऋकारे रेफः विद्यते । परस्य च = ऋकारस्य च । पूर्वेऽर्धे रेफो विद्यते। ह्र्सीयाँस्तु = ह्रस्वतरः ; सा रेफः ; इतरस्मात् = ऋकाररेफात् ; अल्पतरः । न वा ह्र्सीयान् = समां ईवा वा । मध्ये सः = स रेफस् तस्य ऋवर्णस्य मध्ये द्रष्टव्यः = नादौ, नान्ते । ऋ ॠ ।



The meaning I provided ("one fourth time is taken by /a/, followed by 50% of time allotted to /R/ , and then again 25% time to /a/") was from Dr Suniti Kumar Chatterjee's voluminous work "Origin and Development of Bengali Language". When Dr Chatterjee published that monumental work in 1926, there was no translation or commentary of Rk-praatishaakhyam. I think Dr Chatterjee took help from traditional scholars. He was also a great linguist himself. Dr Chatterjee's three-volume book is in my personal library at my birth-place which I left years ago to settle in Varanasi but I could not bring all books to Varanasi, hence I cannot cite the exact page number). I had read it in around 1981-2 when I was a student of language and linguistics, although this book was not in the syllabus. I vividly remember his citations from Rk-praatishaakhya.



In 1970, a Hindi commentary of Rk-praatishaakhyam was published by Chowkhamba, commentary by Dr Virendra Kumar Verma, a professor of Sanskrit and Pali in BHU. His translation (Hindi) is generally good, but faulty sometimes, as in this case. Dr Virendra Kumar Verma renders the following meaning (in Hindi, here English translation is mine) :



"Reph is present in ऋ. Reph is present also in the first half of latter varna (= ॠ ). That (later) reph is hrsva, smaller than the reph of ऋ ; or not smaller (i.e., both ऋ and ॠ have same length of reph) . That reph of ऋ is in middle portion of ऋ, neither in beginning and nor in the end portion of ऋ."



One part of this translation is confusing : it does not clarify whether the reph of ऋ and ॠ are both equal or different. But the point in question here is clear : reph is in middle portion of ॠ. Hence the rendering by Dr Chatterjee is in conformity with Dr Verma's translation : the middle portion (half) of ॠ has reph. But it is not clarified in the verse or in Uvata-commentary or in Verma-commentary what is the sound in the remaining half (initial 25% and latter 25% of ॠ). Dr Suniti Kumar Chatterjee is the only person who says that sound is the central vowel hrsva /a/ .



Two points are worth mentioning is this context :



\(1\) ऋ has reph in its middle portion, but ॠ has reph in its first half.

\(2\) The reph of ॠ is either equal to or smaller than the reph in ऋ (but never greater in length).



Thus, there is a major qualitative difference between ॠ and ॠ. It has not been clarified what is the exact length of reph in ॠ. I think we need a thorough research into all available pratishaakhyas to solve this confusion. Unfortunately universities are not interested in such a research (and I am already overburdened).



*\> "What do you mean by "when ऋ is accompanied by अ". As per Sandhi rules ऋ + अ becomes र which is nothing but र् + अ, and the अ sound in this is no different from अ. So what you are saying above contradicts a grammar rule from pre-Paninian Vedic days."*



ऋ is not a sandhi of two different vowels, it is one single pure vowel. Its internal structure is described in Rk-praatishaakhya. Sandhi rules of grammar do not apply to internal phonemics of a pure vowel.



Next point : I wrote " there is no special phoneme for this retroflexed
/a/ and therefore Rk-pratishakhya is correct in ascribing this sound to /a/ phomene" and you ask for citations for a thing (retroflexed /a/) which does not exist. Unless modern descriptive linguistics is learnt properly, my points will never be understood.



*\> " but what we are missing is the audio. If you can record samples in your voice for how you think the vowel's pure pronunciation is, and how it became रु or रि, it would help all of us."*



What audio do you need ? The actual sounds are different for various branches of Vedas and no one is a master of all shaakhaas. Not only this, there are many phonetic variations of reph &c in a single Vedic shaakhaa. Please read the praatishaakhyas. Paninian grammar gives general rules. Vedic svaadhyaaya should be done according to rules of one's own shaakhaa's praatishakhya : this is the very meaning of Praati + shaakhya (= rules of a particular shaakhaa of Veda). If you are a YV brahmin, you should follow YV-praatishaakhya. But YV has two prratishaakhyas, one each for White and Black YV. White YV praatishaakhya is more voluminous. But RV praatishaakhya is even more voluminous and contains a large number of common rules which are applicable to all shaakhaas of all Vedas because these common rules are mentioned only in RV- praatishaakhya. The most voluminous praatishaakhya is of Samaveda, but it is because of the special characteristics of saama gaana. For general phonology, RV- praatishaakhya is a must. If you have a real interest in exact Vedic pronunciation, you must study RV- praatishaakhya and then other praatishaakhyas if you can. ***No comparative study of all available praatishaakhyas have been carried out to generalize the basic rules common to all shaakhaas of all Vedas and to classify the specific rules applicable to particular shaakhaas only.*** **It is a great task. If you or anyone else can do it or compel some university department to do it, it will a great service to yourself (and to all of us) and to your (and my) ancestors who sacrificed their lives to preserve the Vedas.** I am already overburdened in my own field.



\>" This is not true, the symbols for the vowel (ऋ and ॠ) and the matras definitely exist in alphabets."



I am talking of the 50% internal constituent of ऋ which is a retroflexed /a/ (=अ) of 1/4 maatraa before and 1/r maatraa after the half-reph within ऋ , but this retroflexed अ is coloured by the phonetic quality of accompanying reph. The sound I am talking of is an allophonic variant of अ and not of ऋ, but this allophone of अ is present in ऋ (according to Dr Chatterjee). You can understand it better if I send you a spectrographic analysis of this sound, but for understanding that you need the theoretical knowledge of general principles and concepts of Acoustics with some practical experience in spectrographic studies of speech sounds (a branch of Physics). Many English departments are doing it, but I am sure no Sanskrit department has any real interest in this field (perhaps JNU's Sanskrit department has some interest ; I am not sure).



\>"in the name of Parampara, we do not question our elders."



What do you mean ? The orders of rishis in Praatishaakhyas is not a part of paramparaa, and the current practices are paramparaa (please clarify) ? If it is so, who will decide whether North India /ri/ is correct or South Indian /ru/ is the correct rendering of ऋ , because both North and South Indians claim "paramparaa" but neither of them has any classical canonical basis ? Correct pronunciation of Vedic mantras have direct supernatural effects. Hence, any wrong utterance of any Vedic mantra must be strictly forbiddeen : this is our common paramparaa, because all our paramparaas are ultimately rooted in the Vedas. If we do not preserve the Vedas, we will not preserve ourselves. **Veda is not the written text, it is the oral tradition handed down as shruti through guru-shishya paramparaa which is the SHAAKHAA. Each Shaakhaa is the real Veda and each shaakhaa must be preserved by means of its own praatishaakhya through daily Svaadhyaaya as a part of Nityakarma** (please read the Wikipedia article on Svadhyaaya). The rest is gossip and hearsay.
