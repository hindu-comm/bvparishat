Namaste All :

  

The correct pronunciation of retroflex  /R/  is described in Rgveda's Rk-Pratishakhya. The vowel with retroflex  /R/ is between /i/ and
/u/, and is slightly uplifted short central vowel /a/. Correct pronunciation of varnas is essential for Vedic mantras. Each brahmin must pronounce the mantras according to the rules of his own pratishakhya. If some pratishakhya does not say anything about a particular sound, then Rk-Pratishakhya should be followed. In the current context, one fourth time is taken by /a/, followed by 50% of time allotted to /R/ , and then again 25% time to /a/ : this is Rg-Pratishakhya's description of the vowel /R/. What Rg-Pratishakhya does not mention is the fact that when retroflex /R/ is accompanied with central vowel /a/ , the central vowel is slightly uplifted and slightly turned towards retroflexion due to influence of /R/, and therefore the phonetic quality of this /a/ is quite different from that of the phomenic /a/. But in theory, there is no special phoneme for this retroflexed /a/ and therefore Rk-pratishakhya is correct in ascribing this sound to /a/ phomene. Actual Veda is not the written version, but the particular shaakhaas handed down through guru-shishya tradition. This tradition knew the shortcoming of Rk-pratishakhya in its phonological description of /R/ , and therefore in actual practice tried to uplift the vowel /a/ associated with /R/. Since there was retroflexion in /a/  South Indian brahmins tried to replace /a/ with
/u/ which is a back vowel and is nearer to retroflexed /a/. Rgvedic shaakhaas became extinct in North India, and therefore brahmins of other vedas, mainly of Madhyandina White Yajurveda and Kauthumi Samaveda which remained in vogue in North, were ignorant of Rk-pratishakhya and allowed this sound to drift towards the most lazy and easiest utterance : the uplifted front vowels  /e/ or /i/ (front vowels are preponderant in Prakrit and vernacular languages in all parts of the world because back of tongue is fixed and front is free to move). That is why non-RV brahmins of North India drifted towards /Ri/ while Southern brahmins chose the sound /Ru/ to be near to original sound. But the original sound has no symbol in any Indian alphabet. The vowel associated with
/R/  is exactly midway three vowels : i, e, u. Or, it is /a/ but lifted upwards between /i/ and /u/. Unfortunately, neither the yajnic priests have any interest in preserving and using the original Vedic sounds, nor our linguists have any interest in going beyond the limits set by Europeanist linguistics and unravel the original Vedic phonology.
