Thanks for the detailed explanation of the pronunciation of the vowel.

  

Please differentiate between रृ and र् and ऋ and र्र्or the र् in र्क and similarly in writing र्रin pronunciation than writing Ri, Ru, ir, etc. For me the above three are similar in pronunciation used as consonant र्+ मूर्धन्यvowel/consonant ऋ.
