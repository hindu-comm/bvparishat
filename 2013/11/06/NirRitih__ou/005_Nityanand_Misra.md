Thanks a lot for clarifying. I thought you were talking about what Panini calls "Aasya" in the definition of Savarna.1-1-9 तुल्यास्यप्रयत्नं सवर्णम्.

Yes, just that I never had access to aमाध्यन्दिनी शाखा teacher. But I do plan to start soon.

Let's not cite Wikipedia. Even after editing it for five years now, I never cite it.

For this very reason - too many people trying to enforce their own world view.

Thanks for the verse and the explanations. They certainty help in understanding pronunciation of the vowel in Rgvedic tradition.

  

But they do not address the problem - whats was the standard pronunciation of the vowels outside of Rgveda and outside of Vedic literature in classical Samskrita, where the authority is Panini. As per Paninian principles, a consonant being present in a vowel does not sound right at all. Maybe "Repha being present inऋ/ॠ" means they are the बीज vowel corresponding to the consonant, like a tree being present in the seed. Moreover, Panini exhibits a phenomenal knowledge of all Shakhas of his time and all corresponding Pratishakhyas, and yet in his system the concept of Repha being present in ऋ/ॠ does not find a mention.

You misread me. I said as per Sandhi rules "ऋ + अ becomes र". This does not meanऋ is a Sandhi of two vowels (I do not know where you interpreted this from), but means that "र is the Sandhi of ऋ and अ".

I asked for the Pratishakhya citation, not a special non-existent phoneme.

Well, I have enough experience in digital signal processing to understand spectography. I also have sound samples of how some scholars think the vowel was pronounced. But

Both are Paramparaa. In the name of Paramparaa of Pratishakhya, we do not question the Praatishakhya (which is not Sruti). Panini did question Pratishakhyas, as he differed from them at several places - we do not. In the name of Paramparaa of current Brahmins, we do not question them either.



I agree with you that both the pronunciations in North and South are wrong. I agree with you that Veda needs to be learned as per one's own Shakha. But there is Samskrita beyond Vedas too (Valmiki, Vyasa, Kalidasa). How does one pronounce the vowel in Laukika Samskrita as per you? The descriptions are not useful. The spectral analysis and its Fourier/Laplace transform would not help. Phonetics is learn by listening to the speaker, which is why I requested for an audio recording, which as per you, is the correct pronunciation in Paninian system.
