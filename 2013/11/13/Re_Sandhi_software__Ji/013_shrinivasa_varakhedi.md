Dear All,

  

As pointed out by Prof. Amba Ji, we need to work collaborative model. Codes of softwares developed by many groups are open source.

  

As part of the doctoral research, Sridhar has developed a program in Java, that interprets sutras and applies the rules in a given context. It is exactly replica of ashtafhyayi. The basic algorithm has been published in proceedings of international symposia.

  

Warm regards,

Shrivara
