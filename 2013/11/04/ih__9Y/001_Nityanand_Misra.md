1\. Please choose an appropriate subject for the post - this will get the attention of the scholars in the area of your interest.

2\. Please introduce yourself and your research objectives before asking a question.

3\. Please be clear in your communication - if we do not understand you and/or if your questions are not specific, we will not be able to help you. If it helps frame the question better, feel free to write in a language other than English (e.g. Samskrita/Hindi/Telugu) - there are scholars from almost all parts of Bharata on this forum.

  

I am afraid if questions are worded like your email, people cannot help you even if they wanted to.
