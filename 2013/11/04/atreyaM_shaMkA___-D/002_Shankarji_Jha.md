Swasti, In my opinion, the 4th form is correct----Nir+Ritih, where Ra-kaara of 'Nir' is before the Ri-kaara of the word 'Ritih', in this state Rakaara goes above in the normal writing practice. In the first form also there is the same situation, and the form is correct, but this form of writing is not so common. With regard,
