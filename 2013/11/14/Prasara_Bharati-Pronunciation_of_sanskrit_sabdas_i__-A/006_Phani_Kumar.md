Namaste. Before the matter raises more heat and dust, I must hasten to clarify the purpose of raising this issue in the first place. It is not to say how people of certain regions pronounce sanskrit. It is to say how the current crop of news readers are reading the news. I am not overly worried that some people say अर्जुन and others say अर्जुन् at all. But if the script says अर्जुन, can the reader of the very same script pronounce it as अर्जुन् ? Current news and archived news are available on the website “Newsonair.com”. Quite often scripts of news are also published on this site. When you compare what is written on the script with how it is pronounced, there is often a variance of the type mentioned.

If all of us or most us feel that such things do not matter, no remedy is required and business as usual must be continued, so be it.

On the other hand, all of us or most of us feel it must not be so, let us do something about it.

A straightforward issue like this must be amenable to solution through civil discussion.

Thank you.
