Namaste

It is not justMr. Baladevananda Sagar issue (do not be so specific about names please), or justnews in Sanskrit over All India Radio. It is everywhere.North Indians or precisely those with anajanta-ending words in their bhAShAs, spell Sanskrit words the same way as they are spelt in their native languages..! You specify it to News; it is not fair, though matters a lot.

  

I came across many instances of such wrong pronunciations myself, and unable to tolerate the distorting of devabhAShA, , when I tried to point out the right way, "pronouncers(?)" laughed at my own ajanta-pada-uccAraNam(Telugu native)and wanted me to realize I was wrong.., not they!!

  

It is to be agreed that we all learn Sanskrit, but through our own languages, and mostly do not care (sorry to say) for Sanskrit as an independent individual language. (for many many reasons- from socio-political, cultural, linguistic to personal).Beginners often get confused.We need to be addressing this issue on a more serious level.
