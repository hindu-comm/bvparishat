hariH OM,  
  
The tendency of a few southern Indians (those like film actors, politicians etc. not a majority, but a few of them, those who want to align with the "mainstream" bollywood names) pronouncing their names with halanta allu arjun (as the example was given) is:  
1. a colonial hang over still being perpetuated by pop-culture and bollywood. the colonials favoured the northern Indian pronunciations more than the southern ones (wherever they went in southern India they kept changing names, but not everywhere in the north). the britishers favoured the samskR^itam pronunciations of bengalis / hindis. About the pronunciation of bengalis, the lesser said the better.  

2\. This sort of pronunciation is not found in those who know samskR^itam (which is the case of the discussion here, that of a samskR^ita news reader, who is supposed to know good samskR^ita pronunciation).  
  

 Hence, to take "allu arjun" as an instance of southern Indians using halanta everywhere is an unfair response to the valid observation of Ms. Usha Sanka. Also, it is an effort at clutching at straws.  
  
The pronunciation of samskR^itam by those who have learnt samskR^itam in the south is closer to shikShA than the northerners. One wonders where the tradition of truncation of the last "a" svara started from. they don't truncate any other svara as far as i know. हिन्दी is हिन्दी both in spoken and written word whereas the northerners (even very very knowledgeable ones) will say मुण्ड् कोप् निशत् one wonders why not म्ण्ड्क्प्न्श्त् (usage of श् here is intentional). I request those with a knowledge of the history of the pronunciation of hindi / prAkR^ita to kindly respond.  
  

svasti,
