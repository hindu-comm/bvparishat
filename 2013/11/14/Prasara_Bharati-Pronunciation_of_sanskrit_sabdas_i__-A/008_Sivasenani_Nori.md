\- Only, arjuna (అర్జున) is not the "right" spelling. It is arjunuDu (అర్జునుడు), which the actor concerned does not use. Presently the halant is the preferred prathamAvibhakti is Telugu, due to the influence of Hindi. That this is so becomes very clear when we consider other the names of other film stars and personalities - Mahesh, Venkatesh, Suresh etc. and their movies like Ganesh etc. All of these end with eeSa (ईश) and so even taking the preference for halant into consideration, we should have expected the spellings like maheS (మహేశ్), veMkateS (వెంకటేశ్), sureS (సురేశ్), gaNeS (గణేశ్). However that is not the case. It is difficult for a Telugu speaker to make out the difference between S (श्) and sh (ष्) as pronounced by a North Indian - and writes the above names ending in sh (ष्) ! So now we have the forms mahsh (మహేష్) veMkatesh (వెంకటేష్), suresh (సురేష్), gaNesh (గణేష్). Of late the standards in Telugu newspapers have increased and sometimes the ending in 'sh' is avoided, but most film credits have the wrong spelling. So much about correct and incorrect spellings in Telugu. Many Telugu speakers have other difficulties while speaking in Sanskrit - such as in using the proper linga (we have a strong preference for neuter); differentiating श् and स्, थ and ध, शृ and श्रु (and others like कृ and क्रु similarly) and in pronouncing mahaapraaNas.

  

The point being made was different. Those would not be appreciated in a place where higher standards are expected. Prasar Bharati news definitely is one such place.
