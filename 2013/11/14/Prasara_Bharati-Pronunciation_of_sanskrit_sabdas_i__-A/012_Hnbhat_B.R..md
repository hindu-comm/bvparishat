One wonders where the tradition of truncation of the last "a" svara  
started from. they don't truncate any other svara as far as i know.  
  

Better to say, as I hear them pronouncing the vowel अ. But see my  
earlier reply that Bhattoji new the प्रयोग of ह्रस्व अकार and Panini  
new, with the last sUtra - अ अ in the अष्टाध्यायी.  
  
which has been interpreted by भट्टोजी and others as संऋतमनूद्य  
विवृतोऽनेन विधीयते।  
  
which Panini new two प्रयोग-s of it. We have not heard it in प्रयोग,  
like other vowels, we pronounce it as विवृत vowel.
