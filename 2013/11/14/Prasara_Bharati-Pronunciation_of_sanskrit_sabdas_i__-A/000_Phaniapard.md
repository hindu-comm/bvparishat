Namaste. I do not know whether it is kosher to raise this issue in this forum. Having failed to interest the Ministry of I&B in remedying the perennially persistent defect, I am turning to BVP. This relates to reading of news in sanskrit over All India Radio.All readers of sanskrit news save Mr.Baladevananda Sagar pronounce all ajanta sabdas as though they were halantas. If it was not for the sentence construction, one could easily mistake the sanskrit news for hindi news, if one heard it from a distance. Youngsters listening to the pronunciation of these readers could easily take it to be the correct way. Is there a way one could impress upon the authorities that be that correct pronunciation is such an integral part of sanskrit language that vedangas were devoted to this subject. Thank you.
