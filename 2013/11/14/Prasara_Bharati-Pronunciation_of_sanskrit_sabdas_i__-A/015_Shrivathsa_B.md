hariH OM,  

bhaTTa mahodaya,  
  

 the following is a an instance of a person who is a very great vyAkaraNa j\~nAtA (shrii rAmabhadrAcArya svaamii from the tuLasi piiTha, chitrakUTa) from the north pronouncing the word once in hindii as abhajyat and the same word as abhajyata in samskR^itam:  
<http://youtu.be/DBP45MmPIgc?t=1h45m00s>  
  

 hence i think the saMvR^ita, vivR^ita, not hearing "a" properly etc. can be set at rest.  
  

svasti,  

 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,  

 shrivathsa.
