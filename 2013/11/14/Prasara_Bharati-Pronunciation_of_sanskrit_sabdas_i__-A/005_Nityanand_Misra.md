Spell?? You mean pronounce.

Really? Let's see how some Samskrita names are written and pronounced in your own language -

  

"అల్లు అర్జున్" - 218,000 results in Google Search for the Halanta spelling

"అల్లు అర్జున" - 11,300 results in Google Search for the Akaaraanta spelling

  

***More than 90%*** of Google hits have the "wrong" (from Samskrita point of view) spelling అర్జున్ and less than 10% have the "right" spelling అర్జున. Do I need to say how many people pronounce the actor's name incorrectly (without schwa syncope) in your state? I can go on with other examples, but let's leave it here.

  

Nothing unexpected with people laughing and/or "correcting" others. People assume a pronunciation which is different from what they are used to is wrong. This is not specific to Hindi speaking regions. A person from Awadha pronouncing ज्ञान as ग्यान (natural from where he comes) will get stares in Kathiawar because the listener expects ग्नान - both are wrong from a Samskrita perspective. This is not even specific to Devabhasha, a person will get corrected for pronouncing the English letterM as "em" (IPA ˈɛm) in southern India because the listener is used to "yem" (IPA jˈɛm). In fact not just pronunciation, even usage - aKathiawadi speaking કરવાનું છે (करवानुं छे, natural from where he comes) in central Gujarat gets laughed at because the listener expects करवुं छे (કરવું છે). A different accent will be laughed at anywhere - there are people who make fun of others' accents for a living!
