Namaste

A, The posts below bring up specific issues :  
1. what is the standard pronunciation for a word in a given language- tagged as Samskrutham ( chandas and bhashaa distinctions noted)- Prakrutham - and social language usage ?

2\. Who speaks standard language? This also covers the theme of trainers- validators- appreciators of standard language, who have a sensitive esr- tongue and mind for these issues,

3\. What are the scripting conventions of standard language?  

B, These issues are addressed clearly in panini-patanjali tradition.

First issue is covered by the guidance 'upadeshaah shuddhah paThyante' . The voiced teaching guidance will be pure and perfect. The persons who do this upadesha are Shishta = trained in respective branches, who care to keep the language streams pure and clear. So much so, in vedic training tradition, the students of different vedas/ shaakhas were to be physicaly distanced out so that one student does not get a overlay of voice from another tradition/ another school. Even mixing of students of different vedas was avoided, with this kind of constraint, the purity of phoneme units pronunciation- cognition was guarded.

Unless the Samskrutham phonemic purity is intended to be guarded through the use of reading Sanskrit news+ there is an intention to use broadcast news as a standard reference for samskrutham studies, the debate below looses its sense.

If the purpose of Sanskrit news broadcast is to serve as a news broadcast as in any other language, then the topic of language standard does not arise. For example, there is a daily English news broadcast by several nations including UK/ BBC. Only BBC news reading serves two purposes: news communications + setting British Standard English pronunciation globally. Is such a thing happening/ expected in Sanskrit news reading? Which for all practical purposes has been heavily accented and influenced by regional language pronunciations ?

On point 2, where are the people who fit the description of Shishtas given in tradition? And coming for news reader jobs ? Adding a
vibhakti-pratyaya is not enough and suffucient to call a given speech as meeting the standard of Samskrutham? The criterion of freedom from ' apa-shabda/ dushta shabda' has to be assessed.

On point 3- lot more research is needed. This is brought out in many posts below. Then, what is the trend seen ? Fitting devanagari lipi to roman alphabet characters with a diacritic marking going by international phonetic convention OR use a near- practical regional language convention. Both ways the scripting convention inaccuracies extend to phonetic dimensions in reading ; and this naturally effects the reading of a written text document.

Corrections for deviant readings of written text demand a sound knowledge of vocabulary- grammar- context and conventions. Technically called the vedanga equipment. The absence of this glaringly seen . This error is greatly embraced and adopted by many tecno-linguistic enthusiasts, desiring to fit indian languages on English phonetic outlay!?

I hope that Samskrutham enthusiasts deliberate on these points and come to an action which will be aligned to panini-patanjali traditional guidelines.
