The two issues are related to a great degree since throughout India, Saṃskṛta pronunciation is impacted to a great degree by the speaker's mother tongue - this has been the case for many years - the schwa deletion prevalent in the mother tongue impacting Saṃskṛta pronunciation was highlighted long back by people like Brahmadatta Jijñāsu and Bhīmasena Śāstrī in their works, and they tried their best to teach the right pronunciation.

  

The remedy is obvious (but implementation difficult) - either Prasar Bharati hires well-trained newsreaders or gets the newsreaders sufficiently trained so that they get rid of the mother-tongue effects. It is quite difficult to get rid of one's phonetic aspects like accent, tonal variations, etc while speaking a language different from the mother tongue - even more so in adulthood. But what is even more difficult, is to find scholars who can impart training in pureSaṃskṛtaphonetics. Who can impart such training? Only those whose own pronunciation is pure to begin with - either learned by a Paramparāwhere pronunciation is not impacted by the mother tongue, or learned by the scientific approach. There are very few such teachers today, but there were many till the 1970s - the likes of Rāmaprasāda Tripāṭhī Ji, Bhūpendrapati Tripāṭhī Ji, Kālikaprasāda Śukla Ji - svanāmadhanyaSaṃskṛtascholars under whom Baladevānanda Ji studied (being my Guru's satīrthya, Baladevānanda Ji is like my pitṛvya). This is why there is not an iota of Gujarati touch to hisSaṃskṛtapronunciation - so pure, so mellifluous, so enrapturing.

  

PS: If you know of such teachers, you may request Samskrita Bharati or a University to approach Prasar Bharati and offer free training for newsreaders under the teachers. I would not expect Prasar Bharati to spend on this.
