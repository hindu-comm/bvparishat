hariH OM,  

Sir,  
  

 I don't know how bhaTToji dIkShita or pANini pronounced the hrasva "a" but I have access to an AcArya who has learnt veda in a traditional way for more than 14 years (a ghanapAThi with an in depth knowledge of shaDa\~Ngas). The way he pronounces the hrasva "a" at the end of words is drastically different from the northern Indian pronunciation. Hence I am clear that this is not a fault of my hearing. It is not a matter of me being a kannaDiga (by naturalization).  
  

 by the way, what do you say about the other observation? मुण्ड् कोप् निशत् this is a tendency of eating away hrasva "a" by hindis only. This is not obviously as per bhaTToji dIkShita or pANini (at least the first two instances if you insist that my hearing is wrong in the last case).  
  
svasti,  

 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,  

 shrivathsa.
