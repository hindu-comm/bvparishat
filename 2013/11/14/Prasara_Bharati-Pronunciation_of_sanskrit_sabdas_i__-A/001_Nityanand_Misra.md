Firstly, let's correct some mistakes and generalizations.

Wrong -अतिव्याप्तिदोषः. Not all ajanta, but only the hrasva-akaaraanta sabdas which do not have a conjunct consonant before the the final akaara. Some people may think I am "palavering" yet again, but people are expected to be precise themselves when they are pointing out mistakes in others.

  

You may want to know why this happens. It is the effect of mother-tongue - in this case it is due to the phenomenon called "schwa syncope" present in the mother tongue of the readers. You may want to read about this.

  

Baladevananda Ji's rendition does not have this because he is a veteran scholar who studied at SSU in 1970s from stalwarts like Ramprasad Tripathi, Bhupendrapati Tripathi and Kalikaprasad Shukla, some of the best scholars in India in those days. The newer readers are not as scholarly and they have this mother tongue effect.

Wrong -अव्याप्तिदोषः.Schwa syncope is present in all major Northern languages like Hindi, Gujarati, Bengali, Marathi, Bhojpuri, Punjabi, etc. Even modern day Braja and Awadhi speakers have it, though I have reasons to believe that Braja and Awadhi in the times of Surdas and Tulsidas did not have it.Moreover, the phenomenon is also seen in pronunciation of Samskrita names in southern languages. An example from Kannada film industry names - Samskrita names are spelt ಗಣೇಶ್,ಯೋಗರಾಜ್ andನಾಗರಾಜ್ with the halanta ending (instead ofಗಣೇಶ,ಯೋಗರಾಜ andನಾಗ ರಾಜ - the pure Samskrita form) - because the terminal schwa is not pronounced in these names. In south, there is the phenomenon of elongating the terminal schwa by the native speakers, opposite to the schwa syncope in the north, east and west - both are wrong for the Samskrita purist.

  

So why it appears like "Hindi" to you is beyond me, it appears like modern Prakrits, not just Hindi.

Only one way - get good Samskrita scholars (and only on merit please, no reservation for any caste) to read the news. Scholars whose pronunciation of akaaraanta words in Samskrita is not influenced by their mother tongue. Now the community of good Samskrita scholars is so small(an endangered species)that if Prasar Bharati becomes selective, they may have to shut down the news altogether.
