Respected All,  
  
This is nothing to do with subject in the discussion thread. But a point raised by Dr. Nityanand ji.  
  
Let me share a story! In my previous organization (C-DAC), one of my colleague’s name was 'Ananda'. I was intrigued for some time whether the person is 'He' or 'She.' After a long time, during a cultural event, I found the person to be 'He'. I was happy to learn about this.  
  
Precisely cause of my confusion was - with regard to using feminine words, we Telugus don't distinguish the *dIrghAnta*. Eg. rama, vANi, sudha and so on. All of us know that there are *tajjanya, tatsama* and *tadbhava* words in Indian languages, which are especially influenced by Sanskrit. Usage of such words against Sanskrit grammatical rules is seemingly quite common, as each language has its own characteristics. As I observe, the Kannada native speakers (exempting the cine field, as pointed by Dr. Nityanand) pronounce such proper names as per the substantive ending like ಗಣೇಶ,ಯೋಗರಾಜ, ನಾಗ ರಾಜ and so on. If I am correct, Malayalam has similar feature with regard to *sambuddhi* of proper names. Other aspect of Kannada language is, it has lot of similarities with regard to finite/non finite verbal forms with Telugu.  
  
  

Regards
