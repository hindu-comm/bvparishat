Here is one more similar thread how to influence Sanskrit in Indian Llanguages:  
  
<https://groups.google.com/d/msg/bvparishat/WMKX7WMM_Ao/VqRjM9c5wnEJ>  
  
Here is the link to my message dealing with ह्रस्व अकार according to  
भट्टोजी and पाणिनि -  
  
<https://groups.google.com/d/msg/bvparishat/-AyUasn3N9g/exZu7Y1kBxEJ>  
  
Here is the difference of two अ अ इति - interpreted in modern linguistics:  
  
अ अ  
  
We have here twice the letter A, or A - A. In modern phonetics, this  
would be rendered by:  
  
/a/ --> \[ə\]  
  
The संवृत अकार superseding all the earlier instances in अष्टाध्यायी in प्रयोग.  
  
In Malayalam we have संवृत उकार, which is not present in Kannada or  
telugu, but in Tamil and Malayalam only. The above shows that what we  
pronounce in Kannada, it is not the संवृत अकार, which we never use in  
Kannada. and when we hear it from others we doubt its pure  
pronunciation as in the Hindi language, which we are not used at all.  

  
which has been interpreted by भट्टोजी and others as संऋतमनूद्य  
विवृतोऽनेन विधीयते।  
  

Please read the above line in earlier post, as in the link now given  
which was diretly taken from SK text. itself. Sorry for typo error.
