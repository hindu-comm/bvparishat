Namaste  
  
1. In the context of 'AshtAdhyAyI' , The word 'Atmane' occurs as a part of the technical word 'Atmane-pada' , classified as complment of
'parasmai-pada' in  -ting processes.  
 The prakruti for 'Atmane' is 'Atman'.  
  
2. The question is :  
 2a) What is the meaning of 'Atman' in the context of Paninian rules ?  
   2b) Is 'para' ( other person, other than me, You , He/She /That ) to be taken as the opposite of the word 'Atman' ( -Self, Me, Agent, First person/ Uttama purusha) in the context of Paninian rules?
  
  
3. Why am I seeking response from scholars for this question: The word 'Atman' is a technical term in the pre-paninian literature in multiple resources. The word also occurs as a compound word ( parmAtmA, jeevAtmA, AtmA). In the rule base of ashTAdhyAyI, the word 'AtmA' occurs in two specific modes: One related to verb ( as ting process related) and other contexts where 'Atman' is used as a compound word or other processing. The singular meaning 'Atman' = Self does not appear to be applicable uniformly through the entire text -rule base.  
  
Thanks in advance for the help.
