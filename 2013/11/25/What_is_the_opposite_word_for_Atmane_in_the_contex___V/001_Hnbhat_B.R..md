"स्वं

 रूपं शब्दस्याशब्दसंज्ञा"

  

In Panini has designed his technical terms for the use in his Ashtadhyayi, as above. It doesn't go beyond the plan unless he deliberately overrule his plan. आत्मनेपद is a शब्दसंज्ञा, and come to within the classification, which is technically explained as the class of the suffix,

  

1-4-100 तङानावात्मनेपदम्.  

  

and in the context it means the verbal suffixes तङ् (त-आताम्-झ- etc, 9
suffixes) and आन suffixes (शाऩच्, कानच़्) to be conjugate the verbs.

  

He has explained the usages of these suffixes, in many सूत्र-s beginning with अनुदात्तङित आत्मनेपदम् (1-3-12) and many others, but these are intended to identify the verbs to which the suffixes called आत्मनेपद -are to be affixed, with or without relevance to what आत्मने is means or पद means in all the other schools of Philosophy, than अष्टाध्यायी. आत्मन् may have many interpretations, which has lead through different schools of Philosophy according to their context and tenets of their school. In one Panini makes the idea of the word आत्मन् he has taken into consideration to coin, clearly is with relation to the doer of the action of the verb, if any you want to analyse further the wor आत्मन् ---

  

स्वरितञितः कर्त्रभिप्राये क्रियाफले॥ १।३।७२

  

and it is clear in the examples:

  

स्वं यज्ञं यजति, स्वं यज्ञं यजते। स्वं कटं करोति, स्वं कटं कुरुते। स्वं पुत्रं अपवदति, स्वं पुत्रं अपवदते, इत्यादयः॥where the collated noun suggests the idea clearly, in all the cases of कर्त्रभिप्राये क्रियाफले।  

  

and one can interpret all the occurences with his intelligence and knowledge in Philosophy according to ब्रह्मन् as the doer of all the actions:

  

ब्रह्मार्पणं ब्रह्महविः ब्रह्माग्नौ ब्रह्मणा हुतम् ! ब्रह्मैव तेन गन्तव्यं ब्रह्म कर्म समाधिना !! To Brahman is offered Brahman is itself the offering (oblation), Brahman itself is the offever brahman in Brahman which is again fire. **it will reach Brahman by the meditation and actions of ...Brahman.(the sentient Lord.)**

  

and use आत्मनेपद suffixes to every verb.

  

न कर्तासि न भोक्तासि मुक्त एवासि सर्वदा \|. Neither the doer nor the enjoyer are you. You are the one who is eternally free! -- Ashtavakra Gita  

  

भगवद्गीता has many references that the आत्मन् is not the doer and according to which the above explanation may not be correct "कर्त्रभिप्राये क्रियाफले"

  

अनादित्वात् निर्गुणत्वात् परमात्मा अयम् अव्ययः शरीरस्थः अपि कौन्तेयः न करोति न लिप्यते ॥ ३१ ॥

  

  

  

  

  

Amarakosha has:

  

( १. ४. ३१०) क्षेत्रज्ञ **आत्मा** पुरुषः प्रधानं प्रकृतिः स्त्रियाम्

  

and it gives the various meanings for the word:

  

( ३. ३. ५५७) आत्मा यत्नो धृतिर्बुद्धिः स्वभावो ब्रह्म वर्ष्म च

  

and so on.

  

I don't think it is a good thing to mix up the different interpretations each other.

  

Others may properly reply to your question. The above is my sincere opinion.
