Mishraji,  
  
You may consider the following if you don't get the text from any other source.  
Gita Tatparya Nirnaya with Bhashya in Devanagari (Sivaji font) is available as pdf file at  
<http://michaelsudduth.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Madhvacarya-Bhagavad-Gita.pdf>  
  
It can be converted into Devanagari Unicode using the following online converter.  

<http://hindi-fonts.com/tools/shivaji-to-Unicode-Converter>

  

I tried a sample page and it works. The converted text may need a bit of proof-reading.  



regards  
shankara
