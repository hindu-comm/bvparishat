This is the translation of the English Word into Sanskrit by Monier Williams:

  

\[L=17444\] LAST, s. (Of a shoe) kāṣṭhamayaḥ pādukāsaṁskāraḥ or pādukākāraḥ.  

  

as you are expecting. He has not given any occurrence in Sanskrit any single word, as in English.

  

You can use the same description itself if you want at all to use in your English Sanskrit Translation, if it is the purpose of your question.

  

Please specify your purpose for a word, which is not of Sanskrit origin or look in any English Sanskrit Dictionary like Monier Williams.
