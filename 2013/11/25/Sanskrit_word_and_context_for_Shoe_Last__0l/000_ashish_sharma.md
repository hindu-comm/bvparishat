Dear Learned and scholars  

Pranaam  
  

I am searching for a sanskrit word which means "Last" related to shoes.  
A**last**is a mechanical form that has a shape similar to that of a human foot. It is used byshoemakersandcordwainersin the manufacture and repair of shoes. Lasts typically come in pairs, and have been made from various materials, includinghardwoods,cast iron, and, high density plastics.  

In hindi, people call it as"lakdi ka dhancha" for shoes.  

Can anyone tell me any word for shoe last and has it been used in any sanskrit classics?  
  

regards  
  

Ashish Sharma
