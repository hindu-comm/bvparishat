Dear Sri Misra,  
  

The full verse 'AchArahInam na punanti vedAH...' is available here:  
  
<http://www.scribd.com/doc/20557259/Vasishtha-Smrti>  
  

It is in the 6th chapter as the 3rd verse on the above page. I could not copy-paste it here since it is pasting in junk characters.  
  
regards  

vs
