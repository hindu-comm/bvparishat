namaste mahodaya:

Yes, mantrarajapadastotra is from ahirbudhnya samhita (sri Venkatanatha refers to this in several of his rahasya granthas) but I do not have a ref to the samhita itself. Both these slokas are quoted by Sri Venkatanatha in his commentary 'munivaahanabhogam' (in manipravala) and published by Srimad Andavan Poundarikapuram Swamy Ashramam, edited by sri sriramadeshikacharya. In this book, the mantrarajapada stotra sloka is given as 12th sloka but as per the complete slokas which I have known and seen in other places, it is 11th sloka. You may want to confirm this.
