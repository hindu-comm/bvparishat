Narasimhan Mahodaya

  

Thanks for the references. I will try looking in online editions of Viṣṇudharmottarapurāṇa for the first verse.

  

For the second, I have read that the Mantrarājapadastotram is a part of the Ahirbudhnyasaṁhitā, are you referring to the same Stotram? If so, can you please confirm the publication you have, and the chapter/stotra number of this Stotram in theSaṁhitā.

  

For now I am citing this asMantrarājapadastotram 11, but would be better to give the full citation from theSaṁhitā.

  

Thanks, Nityanand
