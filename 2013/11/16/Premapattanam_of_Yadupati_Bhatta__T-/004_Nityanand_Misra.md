Thank you Swami Ji, I downloaded it. The Premasarvasvam commentary is good. I read somewhere there is another version with a translation of original and the commentary, in addition to Braja Bhasha translation, and forewords by Akhandananda Saraswati and Karpatra Swami. Any pointers to that edition would be great.
