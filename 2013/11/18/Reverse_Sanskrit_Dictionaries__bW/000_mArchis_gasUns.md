Namaste,

  

 I'm aware of 2 reverse dictionaries from Germany and a 2 years old discussion at<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/bvparishat/OtynEDhVtRQ/qTT7jQzG7VMJ>(I understood from that discussion I should find some नानार्थs and give reference to at least मेदिनीकोश in my to-be reverse dictionary, which is planned in 2014, 255k words total from 13 dictionaries). But is<http://books.google.ru/books/about/Sanskrit_Tibetan_dictionary.html?id=YWoaAQAAIAAJ&redir_esc=y>Sanskrit-Tibetan dictionary: being the reverse of the 19 volumes of the Tibetan-Sanskrit dictionary a reverse dictionary as well? Who has seen it? If seen, who can scan a few pages for me, please?

  

Thanks,

M.G.
