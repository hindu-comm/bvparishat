None of the above. Reverse dictionaries are words indexes with some grammatical data and without meanings. Because it's based on real books, maybe 20-21 by the end, than there is no need to add them, but one could look up in the "usual" dictionaries. Otherwise instead of 1100 pages it would take 4400/

Yes, I'm aware of this website. More than that - how many OCR mistakes have you submitted to them? Lot's of fixing needs to be done. But web is web. Print is print. I go for print. I'm no fan of web. Even the dictionaries you mentioned I use locally. Because it's much faster that way.

And because I can use RegEx which is another word fro grep in this context. So I have grep-style functions on my PC for MW.

As I've not seen it, can't tell.

Let me explore it, never heard of it before, thanks. Do you have a scanned page of it?

No they did not. I will show you it one day, I hope. I have some interesting numbers, but not enough time to analyze them. Maybe you can help me?

No, I guess.

What stands behind etc. What more "types" are you aware in them as well, please tell me.

It shows how many words are of particular length. On the left, 1st column - length of words. Above row - name of dictionary.

  

I've got one idea. I want to kill visargas and -m (4759 cases) at the end of the word in Apte, so it would have the same word forms as MW. Is it ok, or do I miss something?
