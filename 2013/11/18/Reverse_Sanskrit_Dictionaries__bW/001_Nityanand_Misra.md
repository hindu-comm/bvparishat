Are you planning a Samskrita -> Samskrita reverse dictionary? Or do you mean an English/Russian -> Sanskrit dictionary?

  

If you mean sorting the words by how they end (or by the last entity in a compound), then rather than publishing something anew, an interface to exisiting dictionaries may be provided. For example if I want to know words ending in "sama" in Samskrita, I go to<http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/mwquery/>, type "sama" in the Samskrita word field, choose "suffix" from the dropdown and search.

  

What I miss in this Advanced Search feature is the option of searching for grep-style "regular expressions". I can currntly search for prefix, suffix, substring but with a regular expression I can search for any sort of word.

Now is this a simple Sanskrit-Tibetan dictionary or a non-conventional "reverse dictionary".

  

A very good English-English reverse dictionary is published by Readers' Digest Reverse Dictionary (<http://www.readersdigestdirect.co.in/reverse-dictionary>) which gives words for meanings, and much more infomation. For example if you look up "stair", it would give you a diagram showing what is "tread", "rise", "baluster" et cetera. In a sense the 19th century dictionaries Sabdakalpadruma and Vacaspatyam doubled up as thesauruses and reverse dictionaries too, as under most words they haveतत्पर्यायाः (synonyms),तत्प्रकाराः (types),तल्लक्षणम् (characteristics), etc.

  

How do I read your bell shaped frequency count tables?
