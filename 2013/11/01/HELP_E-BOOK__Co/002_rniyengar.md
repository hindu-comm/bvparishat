Dear Ajit,

  

I am attaching the first few pages of the book. It should be available in the Delhi Univ. Library and also at the Vishvabharati. The translation given for the Shatapatha BrahmaNa Flood legend text appears not to be following SaayaNa. From my view point, the words Tithi and Samaa appearing twice in the Manu's-Flood (S'a. Br 1.8.1) need to be carefully handled in the translations, which point Eggeling has also overlooked. The Fish descent being the first avatara of VishNu, even for tracing the religious history of Hinduism, the Flood is an important event. All the same, the book is a good reference but there is no analysis of the data.
