==========Mod Note================  
  

Dear Manbendu Sarkar,  
  

If you need a e book please search DLi, archives and similar online libraries at least say that you have tried to search. If the book is not available please try to buy the book or borrow it from a library. Books requests like the way you have made it now are not allowed in BVP. Sharing of books on public forums violates copy write laws if the said book is under copy write. Thanks  

  

Regards  
Ajit Gargeshwari
