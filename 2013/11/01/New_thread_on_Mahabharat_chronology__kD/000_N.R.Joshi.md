Dear Dr. Gargeshvari,

I am not wring about the date of Aadi Shankara. That thread is closed you. But what S. Bhattachya say has bearing on the ancient historical chronology of the subcontinent. Here I quote S. Bhatta

"Buddhists also Nagarjuna and Ashvaghosha were contemporary of Kanishka. Kanishka lived in the 13th century BCE. From Rajatarangini we find that Gonanada III was ruling Kashmir from 1919 of Kali Era, which is 1182 BCE.Prior to Gonanda III Kashmir was ruled by Abhimanyu and prior to Abhimanyu the rulers were Hushka, Jushka and Kanishka"

Here is my question to S. Bhatta and other scholars. Where were Kushans ruling before they came to the subcontinent? What was their name in their language? And what is their relationship to Shakas outside of the subcontinent. Where Shakas were located at the time of Kanishka?

Dear Sunil please do not tell me the destruction of Assyria.

I knew that history. Persians empire is the known history. Can you tell me who were in Persia at the time of Kanishka (13 the century BC)? Shakas were mentioned in Mahabharata. Then where Shakas located at the time of Mahabharata? Thanks. N.R.Joshi
