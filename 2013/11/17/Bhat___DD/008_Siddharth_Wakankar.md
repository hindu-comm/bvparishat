Dear Friends,

Nearly 50 years back,our Sanskrit Professor from Bombay told us that the honorific title Bhatta was given to a Pandit who has commented on the Prasthanatrayi. In those days,(1964),we-the students of the Intermediate Arts Class - never thought of going deep into the etymology or asking for any reference or proof for this statement made by our Revered Teacher.

  

Prof. Siddharth Y. Wakankar
