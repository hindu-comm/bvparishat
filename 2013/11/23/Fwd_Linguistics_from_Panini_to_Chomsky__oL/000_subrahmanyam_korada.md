Dear Professor Korada Subrahmanyam,  



 I am glad to inform you that I have completed the final draft of my book “Linguistics from Panini to Chomsky”, highlighting the impact of Panini’s grammar on modern linguistics. After detailed discussions of all the relevant aspects I arrived at the following conclusion:



“**Modern Linguistics developed in America by Leonard Bloomfield and Noam Chomsky during the 20^(th) century is not an outgrowth of traditional European linguistics, but a revision of Panini’s grammar written in India in the 5^(th) century B.C.”**



 I sent the full text of the book (435 pages) to some foreign professors including Noam Chomsky, David Lightfoot, who wrote introduction to Chomsky’s “Syntactic Structures” (second edition published in 2002) and George Cardona (Pennsylvania University), who has done many good works on Panini’s grammar. The responses were good.

David admitted the similarities between Panini and Chomsky, but made a complaint that discussions on Chomsky’s own contributions which have no precedents in Panini’s grammar are only scattered here and there in this book.

Chomsky wrote to me agreeing with my description of the picture of generative grammar of the 1960s and observed that I have not described the developments since 1960s. If I make this point clear the book makes sense, Chomsky continued. True, I have not described the developments in generative linguistics after 1960s, i.e., recent modifications after the formation of the Standard Theory, because, I think, they have not been influenced by Panini. Accordingly, I added some sentences to the concerned parts of the text to make this point clear, and added a summary of Chomsky’s contributions at the end; and informed them.



Finally, after reading the changes, Chomsky wrote to me that my book “looks fine”, and David wished me ‘good luck’.



**With best wishes,**
