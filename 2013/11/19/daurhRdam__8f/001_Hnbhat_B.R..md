I can't understand what to you want to know except that you didn't  
find both of the words in MW discussed in the body OF your message. I  
found one in MW:  
  
दौर्हृद  
  
(H3) दौर्--हृद \[p= 499,2\] \[L=97218\] n. id. MBh. v , 751  
(H3B) दौर्--हृद \[p= 499,2\] \[L=97219\] m. villain Ni1lak.  
(H3B) दौर्--हृद \[p= 499,2\] \[L=97220\] m. morbid longing of pregnant women L.  
  
and  
  
दौहृद  
  
(H2) दौहृद \[p= 499,3\] \[L=97262\] ( Sus3r. ) = दौर्हृ° (» दौर् under दौः).  
  
in MW Dictionary 2011 Edition. Hope you said these two words you could  
not find in MW.  
you used for your search. I used the one available in Cologne Digital  
Sanskrit Dictionaries.  
  
  
He has given both but without declined forms as usual.
