Namaste Sri lalita-lalita  
  
शिवराम ब्रह्म बोधानन्द घनेन्द्र is mentioned in the colophon of a work called Rajayogatarala by Ramasvami pandita. He is stated to be guru of Ramasvami pandita who is also known as Paranadanatha.  
I need the description of शिवराम ब्रह्म बोधानन्द घनेन्द्र to ascertain the period of composition of Rajayogatarala. There is no details about the author himself. So I thought , I should probe about the guru of the author.  
More information in this regard will be greatly appreciated.
