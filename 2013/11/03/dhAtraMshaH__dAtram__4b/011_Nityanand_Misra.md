A list member asked offline “How come for two tabulated forms,मद्ध्व्वरिandमध्व्वरि in your table, the Sutra6-1-64 लोपो व्योर्वलि does not operate resulting in elision of the second व्? How come the forms with two व्s are Sadhu?”

I answered offline, but thought it would benefit the group also, so I am copying my answer here.

“You have a sharp eye that out of as many as 10 forms with 9 द्वित्वs, you correctly spotted two forms where the conditions of लोपो व्योर्वलि are met, as व् comes in both व्योः वलि. But the answer is simple, the वार्त्तिक causing the द्वित्व is वा 8-4-46 यणो मयो द्वे वाच्ये, which is in त्रिपादी wheras 6-1-64 लोपो व्योर्वलि is in the सपादसप्ताध्यायी. By 8-2-1 पूर्वत्रासिद्धम्, the rule 6-1-64 cannot see the second व् which is the result of वा 8-4-46 यणो मयो द्वे वाच्ये, and so 6-1-64 cannot apply.

If it did apply, there would be infinite recursion with वा 8-4-46 यणो मयो द्वे वाच्ये causing optional duplication and 6-1-64 लोपो व्योर्वलि deleting it (Panini was not a bad programmer!). And that is the genius of Panini, he knew in advance which 4000 Sutras he would recite in the त्रिपादी and in what order, even before he recited 1-1-1 वृद्धिरादैच्.

The forms with two व्s like पर्व्व and पार्व्वती are very common in old inscriptions, and are the preferred forms used in शब्दकल्पद्रुमः. There is no doubt that these optional forms are Sadhu.”
