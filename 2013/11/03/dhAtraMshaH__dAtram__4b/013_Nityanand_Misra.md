Dear Dr. Patel,

Thanks for reviving the thread, I had forgotten about the unanswered issues. I will answer points 1 and 3 in this email. Points 2, 4 and 5 on another day.

*Point 1*

On contemplation, I could think of two examples involving \[so-called\] निषेधसूत्रs, where in one we have स्थानिवद्भाव and in the other we do not, and in both these cases, the presence of absence of स्थानिवद्भाव is exactly similar to how one would have for a normal विधिसूत्र – I show this in my response to Point 3.

The first case is of the Sutra 2-3-69 न लोकाव्ययनिष्ठाखलर्थतृनाम् where the examples in commentaries are सोमं पपिः and गाः ददिः from ऋग्वेद 6-23-4. Here पपिः and ददिः come from 3-2-171 आदृगमहनजनः किकिनौ लिट् च. As कि/किन् are कृत् suffixes, by the Sutra 2-3-65 कर्तृकर्मणोः कृति the genitive case is expected (सोमस्य पपिः and गवां ददिः). But 2-3-69 lists exception with respect to 2-3-65 and prohibits the genitive in case of RV 6-23-4. Now 2-3-69 does not talk about कि or किन् but only about ल (along with उ, उक, अव्यय, निष्ठा, खलर्थ and तृन्). How come then कि/किन्, which are substitutes of ल, get this लत्व in order that 2-3-69 can apply? It is possible only if they were “like ल”. The conclusion is that the कृत् आदेशs of ल, i.e. शतृ/शानच्/कानच्/क्वसु/कि/किन् are to be treated as ल (i.e. it is स्थानिवत्) for this Sutra.

The second case is of the Sutra 8-4-42 न पदान्ताट्टोरनाम्, where the examples in commentaries are षट्ते and षट्सन्तः. Here षट् results from षष् + जस् by

षष् + जस् -> 1-1-24 ष्णान्ता षट् -> षट्संज्ञा -> 7-1-22 षड्भ्यो लुक् -> षष् -> 8-2-39 झलां जशोऽन्ते -\> षड् -> 8-4-56 वाऽवसाने -> षट्

Now if the लुक् substitution of जस् were to be स्थानिवत्, then 8-4-42 could not apply as the पदान्त condition of टोः would not be met – it would have been the now-invisible जस् at the end of the पद and not ट्. The conclusion is that the लुक् आदेश of जस् is not to be treated as जस् (i.e. it is not स्थानिवत्) for this निषेधसूत्र. \[Note that in other cases even an अदर्शन आदेश like लुक् can be स्थानिवत्, as is clear in the example of अवधीत् from commentaries where 7-2-7 अतो हलादेर्लघोः cannot apply to give अवाधीत् which is an अनिष्ट रूप.\]

*Point 3*

After inspection of the above two examples, I now believe that with respect to स्थानिवद्भाव (and elsewhere too), the so-called (more on this below) निषेधसूत्र are to be treated exactly like विधिसूत्रs. This is not something I have read anywhere in any commentary but my own conclusion – please critique this with an open mind and accept it only if you are convinced. The argument in favour of my position is that the traditional classification does not identify the category of निषेधसूत्रs separately –

सञ्ज्ञा च परिभाषा च विधिर्नियम एव च।

अतिदेशोऽधिकारश्च षड्विधं सूत्रलक्षणम्॥

It is only later that Yudhishthir Mimamsaka (YM) and others listed a seventh category of निषेधसूत्रs. In the traditional classification, there is no option but to consider what YM and others call as निषेधसूत्रs as a subset of विधिसूत्रs. In the लक्षणs of all the six types of Sutras in the अध्यात्मरामायणेऽपाणिनीयप्रयोगाणां विमर्शः, my Guru says विधिसूत्रं नाम मुख्यलक्ष्यसंस्कारकमर्थाल्लक्ष्यसंस्कारे मुख्यतया सहायकतावच्छेदकम्। By this definition, what YM and others call निषेधसूत्रs are a subset of the category of विधिसूत्रs since by specifying what is not साधु, they help in elimination of असाधु forms and thus help the लक्ष्यसंस्कार (इष्टरूप).

With this, going back to the two सूत्रs and examples we have

2-3-69 न लोकाव्ययनिष्ठाखलर्थतृनाम् and सोमं पपिः/गाः ददिः. Here the \[exception of\] 2-3-65 कर्तृकर्मणोः कृति is not an अल्विधि but a कारकविधि. Hence by 1-1-56 स्थानिवदादेशोऽनल्विधौ, the substitutions कि/किन् of ल are like ल so that 2-3-69 can apply to पपिः and ददिः.

8-4-42 न पदान्ताट्टोरनाम् and षट्ते/षट्सन्तः. Here the \[exception of ष्टुत्व\] is an अल्विधि so 1-1-56 स्थानिवदादेशोऽनल्विधौ cannot apply. But neither can 1-1-57 अचः परस्मिन् पूर्वविधौ, since even though \[excepted विधि\] is a पूर्वविधि for the लुक् आदेश, the लुक् आदेश is not the आदेश of a vowel (but of the entire suffix जस्) and it is not caused by a following entity, so the two conditions अचः and परस्मिन् are not met. As 1-1-56 cannot apply, 1-1-57 also cannot apply because the latter lists exceptions with respect to the former. As none of 1-1-56 and 1-1-57 can apply, the conclusion is that the लुक् आदेश is not स्थानिवत् so that 8-4-42 can apply.

I have a flowchart in mind for the स्थानिवत् rules now, but I will keep that for another day.
