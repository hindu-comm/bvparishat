Sorry to start once again this 13 day old discussion.

There are many untied ends, which needed clarification.

Once these untied ends are tied up, there will be more clarity on this issue.

  

  

Points 1 to 5 are from Mr. Nityanand Misra's answers. Point 6 is from Mr. H N Bhat's answer.

  

1.Let me think of some more examples - will get back later on this.

  

2.I read somewhere that both दात्रम् and दात्त्रम् forms are valid, I I do not remember where I read this.

  

3.In this light, my earlier statement "One cannot assume either way - whether a निषेधसूत्र is to treat or not to consider an आदेश as स्थानिवत्” needs to be corrected. Maybe निषेधसूत्रs are to be treated as विधिसूत्रs in this regard - note that the traditional classification of Sutras does not list निषेध as a type even though Pandit Yudhishthira Mimamsaka listed निषेधसूत्र as the seventh type.

I am not sure what the answer is, but it is some food for thought!!

4.Let me go through all sources which I can gather, I do not have many of my grammar books here with me.

5. But I will still attempt to see what difference of opinion is and maybe summarize in a tabular form for everybody’s better understanding.  

  

6. This is natural in case आचार्याणाम् is for विभाषा and in which case, if it is applicable, in the case ofधात्रंशःit could have been taken up in the case of सुध्युपास्यः itself, in सिद्धान्तकौमुदी or any of its commentaries.And there is a difference opinion  whether वा from८. ४. ४५ यरः अनुनासिके अनुनास्किकः वा ।*or*न from the नादिन्याक्रोशे पुत्रस्य॥ ८।४।४७\| is taken up in the following सूत्र-s from८. ४. ५० त्रिप्रभृतिषु शाकटायनस्य । upwards till the present सूत्त्र.
