My pointing out लोपादेशs in दात्रम्‌ was in response to Dr. Patel's point that "दात्रम्‌ has no आदेश at all". The objective was to bring to light the fact that लोपादेशs cannot be taken for granted as not affecting the presence or absence स्थानिवद्भाव. They are to be subjected to the स्थानिवत् rules just like other आदेशs.

This becomes clear from the derivation of कण्डूतिः which uses यलोप from 1-1-58 -

In the step कण्डूय ति -> 6-4-48 अतो लोपः -> कण्डूय् ति, अ gets the लोपादेश (अ -> φ to use Ram Nath Sharma's notation).

Commentaries say that 1-1-58 is required before 6-1-64 लोपो व्योर्वलि can operate for the elision of य्. If लोपादेश elision substitution did not matter in the decision on स्थानिवद्भाव, यलोप from 1-1-58 would not be needed in the Prakriya for कण्डूतिः. That it is shown by commentators as a requirement shows that in some cases, a लोपादेश is स्थानिवत्, in some others it is not. I will need to explore and refer some texts to get a better udnerstanding, but I think below I have examples for both presence and absence of स्थानिवद्भाव for a लोपादेश

1.  The Prakriya of कण्डूतिः shows that the लोप which comes in place of
    अ in the step कण्डूय + ति -> कण्डूय् ति is not स्थानिवत with respect
    to the 6-1-64 लोपो व्योर्वलि rule.  
2.  On the other hand, the लोप which comes in place of इन् in पथिन् + इ
    by भस्य टेर्लोपः 7-1-88 seems to be स्थानिवत् with respect to the
    same rule (a भविधि). Otherwise the rule will apply again on पथ् + इ
    with the टि (now अथ्) being again elided to give the undesired form
    पि instead of पथि.

\[Note that a rule can very well operate on its own output, as Bhattoji’s commentary on नाज्झलौ shows in the Siddhantakaumudi where he treats both आ and अ३ to be प्रश्लिष्ट in the सन्धिच्छेद of the Sutraन अ३ आ अच् हलौ.\]

Eventually, in this example of दात्रम्, the लोपादेशs do not appear to be स्थानिवत् for the application of दीर्घादाचार्याणाम् rules for duplication of त्. If they were स्थानिवत्, then the rule would not have been applicable in the first place as त् would have followed theस्थानिवत्null substitution (φ) and not the दीर्घ. In this light, my earlier statement "One cannot assume either way - whether a निषेधसूत्र is to treat or not to consider an आदेश as स्थानिवत्” needs to be corrected. Maybe निषेधसूत्रs are to be treated as विधिसूत्रs in this regard - note that the traditional classification of Sutras does not list निषेध as a type even though Pandit Yudhishthira Mimamsaka listed निषेधसूत्र as the seventh type.

I am not sure what the answer is, but it is some food for thought!!

Let me go through all sources which I can gather, I do not have many of my grammar books here with me in Hong Kong (where an 800 sq feet home is a luxury!!) and the digital versions are incomplete or have a bad scan. But I will still attempt to see what difference of opinion is and maybe summarize in a tabular form for everybody’s better understanding.
