Hari Om,  
  

This Subhashita speaks about Chandra. Though, Chandra was born along with Lakshmi from the ocean, though himself being adornment of three worlds, for his part to be played in this world of creation went to Parameshvara Himself who wore him in His head. Then also, he went on diminishing (because of the curse of Daksha) and did not wax instead. Mostly, the Karma of the bygone is stronger. Who can do anything for anyone? Nobody can do anything for anyone. Here there is no Swatantrya involved in ones due. That is, nobody can save that person from his प्राक्तनकर्मफल.
