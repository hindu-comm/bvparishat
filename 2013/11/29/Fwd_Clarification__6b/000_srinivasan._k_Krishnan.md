Namaskaram to all, A person known to me is working on a shiva ashtothram project. The person has many doubts and needs clarification which are listed below. i would be much obliged if any body could help with appropriate answers :



  

The project could have different sections which address the following:

-Why do people chant ashtothram?

-How it should be chanted? (as in any particular way to say it, pujai, etc)

-Benefits of chanting the ashtothram of lord shiva

-Scientific explanation if any behind the chanting the names of lord shiva

-“Om Namah Shivaya” and its significance.

-The main section of the project would be about the first 21 names of lord shiva in the ashtothram and its explanation.I thought an image of lord shiva could be used and each name could be used to describe one attribute of Lord Shiva and the spiritual and philosophical significance if any behind the name.In case the name has a mythological story behind it, I thought it could be narrated at that point.



While searching online, I was unable to find information with direct relevance to the project .I could only find direct translations for the asthothram sir. The meanings for certain words differed in each translation. Could you please tell me if there are any books which I can refer to regarding the same? Are there any temples of Lord Shiva I could visit to broaden my understanding or which might help with the research?



  

The word “Shiva” is indicating auspiciousness.what auspiciousness is being referred to here?



Does ॐ नीललोहिताय नमः refer to blue blood?A lot of pictures of Shiva show his as being blue bodied.Is lord Shiva having a blue throat(nila kanTa) or a blue blood or a blue coloured skin?



Is there any reason why each God chooses a particular vAhanam?in the case of Lord Shiva is there any reason behind the bull being his vAhanam?



What does ॐ पञ्चवक्त्राय नमः refer to?



ॐ मृगपाणये नमः refers to the lord holding the deer in his hand or “obeisance to the lord who looks after the soul in the wilderness?Is there any significance for the lord holding the deer in his hand?



ॐ स्वरमयाय नमः –how does the lord create through sound sir?



What does ॐ अहिर्बुध्न्याय नमः mean?



Is there any author for the shiva astothram?



Is there any reason for the ashtothram is chanted in certain number like 108 names?



Why is Om chanted in the beginning of each name?



While meditating upon the form of Lord Shiva does one think of him in the form of a Shiva linga or with the various bodily attributes as described?



Is there a difference between a shloka and a manthra?are the names in the ashtothram a shloka or manthra?can anybody chant it?Should it be recited during the pujai time only or can it be recited at all times?



In images and descriptions why is there a disc of beautiful light which glows behind the Lord’s head?
