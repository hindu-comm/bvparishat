Namonamah,

Thanking you sir. I am having the Lilavati vIthI of Ramapanivada of the same edition you have mentioned. I have started a Sanskrit Commentary on it along with an elaborated English Preface. Therefore I want to add to the history of vIthIs about other vIthIs available.

Thanks and regards.
