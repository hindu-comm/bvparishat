Namaste  
  

Can somebody confirm the correct reading of the fourth verse of Vairāgyapañcakam of Śrīmad Vedāntadeśikācārya? A reference to a printed version of the whole Stotram with any translations/commentaries would be even better.  
  
I found several versions of the Stotram online, but they are all full of mistakes! Sunder Kidambi's version (which has fewer errors) on [ramanuja.org](http://ramanuja.org) has the following reading of the fourth verse -  

  
दुरीश्वर\_द्वार\_बहिर्वितर्दिका-  
दुरासिकायै रचितोऽयमञ्जलिः  
यदञ्जनाभं निरपायमस्ति मे  
धनञ्जय\_स्यन्दन\_भूषणं धनम्  

  

where the red portions appear to be erroneous.  
  

I suspect दुरीश्वरद्वारबहिर्वितर्दिकादुराशिकायैः is a समस्तपद, यदञ्जनाभं is यदब्जनाभं, and धनञ्जयस्यन्दनभूषणं is a समस्तपद. Yet I want to confirm as with his uniquely supreme poetic talent, Vedāntadeśikācārya could play with words in any way he wanted to.  

  

Thanks in advance, Nityanand
