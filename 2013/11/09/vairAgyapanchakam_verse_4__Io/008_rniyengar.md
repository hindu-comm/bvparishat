Thanks Sri Narasimhan for posting the commentary and verifying the text. My father (L) Prof.S.Rangachar brought out all the stotras of Vedanta Desika in Kannada as a help for the commoners. I am attaching two pages showing VP-4 sloka,for comparison.

  

My interest with VP, (apart from the SV-Sampradaaya), is due to its link with history. It is not a stotra-kaavya proper if I am not mistaken. Tradition generally provides six verses even though it is usually known as Pancakam. The first verse and the remaining five (Pancakam) were composed at different dates. Both were answers to a letter sent by VidyaaraNya the famous scholar and PM of the Vijayanagar Kingdom. We know the two replies in detail. How I wish the exact contents of the two letters or messages of Swami VidyaaraNya, were also preserved somewhere!

I wonder if the Sringeri Math tradition has some information on this piece of history.
