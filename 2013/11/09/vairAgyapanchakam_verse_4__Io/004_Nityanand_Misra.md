Thanks Dr. Bhat, the reading I have (a verse which is not cited) has दुरीश्वरद्वारि (द्वार् in locative), दुराशिकायै (I mistyped as दुराशिकायैः with the Visarga) - I have also heard once with कपर्दिकायै instead - and अब्जनाभं. The Samaasas are all correct in this reading, which lead me to believe it is correct - I am not sure though.  
  
With दुराशा = vain hope or despair, दुराशैव दुराशिका (स्वार्थे कन्) तस्यै दुराशिकायै makes sense.  
With कपर्दिका = a cowrie, कपर्दिकायै also makes sense.  
दुरासिका - I had असिः प्रहरणमस्याः इत्यासिका in mind by 4-4-57 प्रहरणम् which does not make sense. It could be from वा. 3-3-108 धात्वर्थनिर्देशे ण्वुल् which my make sense here. पर्याये ण्वुल् says वाचस्पत्यम् with the meaning "पर्यायेणोपवेशनम्" - and cites the usage उष्ट्रासिकाः सुप्यन्ते from Mahabhashya which I do not recall and could not search in the version by George Cordona.  
  
Moreover, if यद् in the second half is to be taken as "however/whereas", then the first line may not mean contempt but it could be irony. This makes more sense with the कपर्दिका/दुराशिका reading -  
  
"This Anjali is spread for cowries/vain hopes at the courtyard of the the ignoble rich, whereas \[ironically\] my \[true\] wealth is .... "  
  
Anyway unless we have a reliable published source, difficult to say which reading is correct. Dr. Bhat, have do you source?
