As someone who has done some adhyayana of my native taittirIya SAkhA and also a bit of Rgveda in recent times, here are my observations, which may be of use.



In yajurveda recitation paddhati, when a dIrgha vowel with a svarita occurs, it needs to be eitherfollowed by a conjunct consonant, or placed in a vAkya-terminal position,in order for the svarita to be rendered as a dIrghasvarita.In Rgveda recitation paddhati, on the other hand, at least in Maharashtra and regions south, a svarita on anydIrgha vowel is always rendered as a dIrghasvarita. In Rgveda recitation, there are also cases where a svarita on a hrasva vowel becomes dIrghasvarita depending on what kind of conjunct consonantal sound follows.



Let us take theSAntimantra, bhadraM karNebhiS SruNuyAma ... which occurs in both.



In the taittirIya recitation, the syllable-Ne- in karNebhiH takes only regular svarita, no dIrghasvarita, although e-kAra is dIrgha in itself. In contrast, later in the same mantra, sthirari angais tushTuvAMsas tanUbhiH, the syllable -gai- in angaiH gets a dIrghasvarita, because it is followed by a samyukta sound, -stu- because of visarga sandhi. In contrast, in the Rgveda recitation, both -Ne- in karNebhiH and -gai- in angaiHare rendered asdIrghasvarita.



Similarly in the purusha sUkta, take the word tasmAt, with svarita on the syllable - mAt-. In yajurveda recitation, there is no dIrgha svaritaon -mAt-when it occurs in the line "yajus tasmAd ajAyata," but there is a dIrgha svarita on -mAt- in "chandAMsi jagnire tasmAt" and in"tasmAjjAtA ajAvayaH." In Rgveda recitation, however, all three instances are rendered in the dIrghasvarita mode.



In print publications over the last couple of centuries, this hasresulted indifferent editorial conventions being used.



Rgveda publications meant for people familiar with Rgveda recitation typically have opted not to put a double vertical mark over a dIrgha vowel svarita syllable when not followed by a samyuktAkshara.



Rgveda mantra-s in publications meant for yajurveda reciters tend to put two vertical marks explicitlyover "mI" in "agnimILe purohitaM ...", over "me" and "bhe" in "ayaM me viSvabheshajo'yaM ...," and over "yan" (hrasva svara but dIrgha svarita) in "citayantam asme" (sacitra citraM citayantam asme).



Prof. Sastry is right in highlighting the need to evolve a consistent set of conventions at least for future publications in print and online. In today's world, even the traditional repositories of the karNa paramaparA are increasingly relying on printed material and are highly likely to misinterpret what they are reading from a boundbook or a hard copy of website contents,as opposed to what they may have heard during adhyayana.



With best regards,

Vidyasankar
