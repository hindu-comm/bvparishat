Refer Pandit Yudhishthira Mimamsaka's comprehensive work वैदिक वाङ्मय में प्रयुक्त विविध स्वराङ्कन प्रकार (1964), published in Ajmer by Bharatiya Prachyavidya Pratishthana. Some notes from this work can be seen here - <http://sanskrit1.ccv.brown.edu/VedicUnicode/passages/PassagesYudhisthiraMimamsakaSvarV.pdf>  
  
Two books, Vaidika Svara Mimamsa by Pt. Yudhishthir Mimamsaka and Vaidika Svara Paddhati by Pt. Amartnath Tripathi will also be useful. Both are available on DLI.
