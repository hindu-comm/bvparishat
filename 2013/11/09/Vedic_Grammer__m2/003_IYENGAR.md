Respected Prof.Korada Subrahmanyam sir, you told about types of svaras.  

उदात्त - no marking , अनुदात्त - underscore , स्वरित - one line on  
the top ,दीर्घस्वरित - two lines on the top .  

But my problem is  
In Text books and reference book ( my reference book rig bhashya by  
vid.venkataram Mysore and some other internet sources ) Non of the  
places दीर्घस्वरित is marked.  
that is, in rigveda first suktha,  
अग्निमीळे पुरोहितम् मी is denoted as svarita in text books .  
But मी is chanted as दीर्घस्वरित.  
I dont know the reason, why the svaras are different in study and chanting.
