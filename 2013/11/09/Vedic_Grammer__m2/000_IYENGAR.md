Pranams to all members ,  
  
In M.A (final) Vedic sukthas-1 \[KSOU\] book  
there is details about vedic svaras.  
udatta, anudatta and avarita.  
symbol for anudaatta underscore, for svarita a  
line on the top of the letter and no symbol for svarita.  
what is my problem here is, In vedic chanting  
there is another mark with two lines on the top of the letter how  
this svara will come.  
  
Also In textbooks and 35 volumes of rig bhashya  
by vid. venkataraman MYSORE. there is no two lines svara anywhere,  
but how this svara will come on chanting.  
Please clear my doubt.
