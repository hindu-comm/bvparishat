Thanks everybody for your replies. The commentaries are intended to be a part of the library at an Ashram and would be used as reference by students, so I would rather buy the hard copies instead of accessing online resources. This is the reason why I am looking for the printed collection of commentaries. Also, I am not looking for the original Tanishloki in Tamil-Sanskrit but its translation into Sanskrit by Atreya Ahobala.



In this regard, I checked the 2010publications of RSVP Tirupati and to my disappointment, the publications are English translations of commentaries while I am looking for Sanskrit original. I did find that RSS New Delhi has published four commentaries together - as shown here

<http://www.kkpublications.com/index.php?p=sr&Uc=5067-AA-A321>



This is great (assuming it is in Sanskrit), but only half of what I want. :( Can any of the professors or research students at RSS New Delhi confirm if publication of more commentaries are planned?



I found that the *The Ramayana of Valmiki: An Epic of Ancient India* Volumes I to VII by Richard Goldman et al refers the following commentaries -  
  
भूषण - गोविन्दराज, अमृतकतक - कतक माधव योगीन्द्र, तत्त्वदीपिका - महेश्वरतीर्थ, मुनिभावप्रकाशिका - अज्ञात, रामायणशिरोमणि - वंशीधर शिवसहाय, रामानुजीय - रामानुज, तिलक - नागेशभट्ट (रामवर्मा), तनिश्लोकी - आत्रेय अहोबल, विवेकतिलक - वरदराज उडाली, सर्वज्ञनारायणटीका, सत्यतीर्थटीका 



It appears that the Critical Edition produced by Oriental Institute, M S University, Baroda has published all of these as the seven volume work refers to several commentaries following the convention of the Critical Edition. However, thewebsite of Oriental Institute under <http://www.msubaroda.ac.in/oriental/>has a blank Contact Us Page.



I would be much obliged if the members can pass on any contacts they have at theOriental Institute, M S University, e.g. of Professor Ramanath Pandey.



Thanks, Nityanand
