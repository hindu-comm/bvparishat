Actually the shubhAShita book too at the end gives the सौ काम छोड़कर भोजन करे meaning in MaraThi. I think the निरीक्षमाणान् जनान् विहाय means 'those waiting to see or talk or have some or the other business with X....' and that X should leave them for the time being and engage in those essentials like eating/bathing...  
  
It might be worthwhile pursuing the lead that Shri Anand gave: the verse or a portion of it cited in an ancient literary work to find out the context in which it was cited there.
