विदुषः क्षाम्यन्तु। In the write-up attached with the earlier email there was a printing mistake - the same has been rectified below and in the attached file. Thanks to Sri V. Subramanian for pointing out the same.

*Māhāvākyavicāraḥ*

The Study of a Discourse



Sentence is taken as a unit of language. A group or words, which render a unitary meaning is called a sentence. On the other hand, a group of sentences, which are interconnected and serve a single purpose or idea is called a Discourse or a *Mahāvākya.*



The book consists of six chapters apart from Introduction and Conclusion.



The first chapter on Pūrvamīmāṃsā (Jurisprudence) deals with the analysis and interpretation of Vedic Discourses.



The second chapter on Vedānta analyses the Upaniṣadic Discourses with regard to Advaita, Viśiṣṭādvaita and Dvaita.



The third and fourth chapters deal with the system of Vyākaraṇa (Grammar) in terms of Discourses of secular and technical nature.



The fifth chapter takes up Nyāya and Vaiśeṣika (Logic) systems and analyses the Logical Discourse.



Alaṅkāraśāstram (Rhetorics) is taken as the source for analysing the Rhetorical Discourse in the sixth chapter.



*Mahāvākyavicāraḥ* is the Ph. D. thesis of the author and it won the Best Thesis Award, 1982 (the Dept. of Sanskrit) from Andhra University, Visakhapatnam.
