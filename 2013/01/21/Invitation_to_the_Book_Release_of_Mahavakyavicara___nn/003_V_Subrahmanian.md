Thanks. I am sorry that I did not do a perfect job in the first instance. I missed out the other error: Māhāvākyavicāraḥ where the मा was not noticed by me. I noticed it only now when I opened your corrected document. I have long realized that proof checking is very daunting. I think you may choose to leave it like that instead of sending another correction which is quite embarrassing.
