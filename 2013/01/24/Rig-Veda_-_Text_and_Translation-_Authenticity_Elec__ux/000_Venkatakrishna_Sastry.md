** This is an important issue on Electronic phylogeny, a current model of validating the authentic text, when palmtops have taken the place of palm leaves and pronunciation.Fonts and diacritics have taken over the VOICE AUTHENTICITY of a HUMAN AGENT-Scholar of Tradiiton.**



**Elementary, Watson ! Defective Primary resource used in any research inherits the defectin a multifold way in the output, making a double dip- endorsement of error. The errors of interpreting Indian traditional resoruces are merrily going on for two hundred plus years, and stronger !**

**Had I searched only for ' brahma / brahman', may be, i would have got this; but then there would have been other multipy connected references which would have nothing to do with ' brahmana' would have been there !**

 Out of 542 plus Memebrs of Parliment, representingIdentity of Indian Citizens, has any one single representative aware of this '
Indian Cultural Identity Distortion' on going ? Yet, every one is fully aware of the caste-controversial issues essentially needed for fighting an election ?
