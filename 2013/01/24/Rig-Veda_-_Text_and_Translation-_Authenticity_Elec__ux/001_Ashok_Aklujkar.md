Dear Dr. BVK Sastry,

  

I can appreciate the warning contained in your remarks reproduced at the end of this post of mine. A good researcher in fields based on philology should indeed collect all the occurrences of words relevant to his/her inquiry and also make sure that the references given by predecessors in the field are accurate (AND note their inaccurate or possibly inaccurate references in his/her research publications for the benefit of future researchers).

  

At the same time, I see a danger in propagating the message the way you have put it:

  

1\. Computers are not intelligent (at least at present). It is presumed that users will use their general knowledge of the field and, while searching a lexeme, will search also for related forms; e.g., to follow the example you have used, brahman should be searched along with [braahma.na/braamha.na](http://braahma.na/braamha.na), brahmaa, the case forms of all of these, the occurrences in compounds and in conceptual groups such [braahma.na](http://braahma.na), k.satriya, vai;sya, ;suudra, and so on), depending on what the researcher's intended research is. Some search programs already remind the searchers where else they should look.

  

2\. What we as researchers did before the electronic/computer age with printed glossaries, indexes, occurrence-specifying dictionaries and encyclopaedias, concordances, etc. was essentially the same as above. The situation has not fundamentally changed, except that computers have made searching far easier, wider and faster.

  

3\. We find errors of the kind you specify also in the old print resources. Even Vishva-bandhu's Vaidika-padaanukrama-ko;sa, done with so much dedication, misses some vocables and forms. There are (minor) oversights and wrong specifications also in Chitrao-Pathak's Mahaabhaa.sya word index. V.S. Apte's dictionary enlarged by such exacting scholars as P.K. Gode has vocables in wrong alphabetical order. But try to imagine where Sanskritic research would have been if we did not have these tools available to us. The same progress needs to be credited, perhaps hundred times multiplied, to the electronic tools that have now become available. It is understood that the dawn of computer age which is appearing on the horizon of Sanskritology is to be welcomed by bearing in mind both gacchata.h skhalana.m kvaapi ... and uurdhvordhvam aaruhya yad artha-tattva.m dhii.h pa;syati ;sraantim avedayantii phala.m tad-aadyai.h parikalpitaanaa.m viveka-sopaana-paramparaa.naam. The baby is not to be thrown out with the bath water.

  

4\. You seem to assume that there is/was a THE CORRECT, ORIGINAL or AUTHENTIC TEXT for the .Rg-veda, if not for all Sanskrit works. I find the assumption questionable (although a defensible and necessary one for recitation traditions to make). There can only be relatively more or less reliable texts, and it is our duty as scholars to try to move as close as possible to such texts. But we cannot, as historians, proceed on the assumption that only someone or some tradition has THE .RG-VEDA.

  

5\. The same consideration applies to translations and interpretations. We not only have to be tolerant toward the variety, we have to make sure that we do not become so absolutist as to stifle all serious, methodically defensible and adequately informed translations and interpretations.

  

6\. The upshot of 4 and 5 is that historical research is a journey, an ongoing process. It is not advocacy articulated at an imaginary or pre-selected destination. (To say this is not the same thing as saying that we do not have freedom to protest against malicious, frivolous or incompetent attacks on a tradition.)

  

7\. I fail to see how electronic resources or errors in them will, by themselves, lead to digestion. The resources made available are a neutral means; they favor neither Westerners nor Indians, neither Christians not Hindus (in a broad sense as standing for followers of all religions of Indian origin). If India produces very few or inferior scholars and they cannot take advantage of the new resourcesproperly and fully, then, of course, India will largely be written about as the outsiders or non-traditionals see it. The situation will be comparable to what the situation of India was after its failure to adopt the gun powder technology or to have an Industrial Revolution of its own. But if Indian Sanskritists bear in mind that it is the presence or absence of truly capable and properly educated users of the new technology that will make the difference, not the technology itself, and if they work toward creating a large class of excellent Sanskritists, there is no reason why the electronic resources should lead to absorption in the belly of Western or Christian universalism.

  

8\. If Indian Sanskritists wish to take full advantage of the new technology that has been made available and to minimize the inconvenience, loss or failure coming from the kind of omissions or errors you have mentioned, they must reduce, as much as they can, the variation seen in the writing of Sanskrit words and sentences, whether it is in native scripts or in romanization. The closer they come to the international and pan-Indian standards (the latter is yet to be created), the greater their success in tracing words, phrases, etc. will be. It is not without reason that the Library of Congress in the USAtranscribes the information about Sanskrit publications as that information is written or printed, not according to how a Marathi or Tamil speaker reads or pronounces the words involved. If those words are romanized by dropping the final a-s , for example, or if sa.msk.rta is fed into the computer as samskrutha, the recovery of texts will be far more difficult and time-consuming. A helpful strategy, therefore, will not be to advocate a replacement of Unicode (or anything similar to it) but to stick as close to it as possible and ask for a few additions and minor modifications. As I recall, Dr. Peter Scharf has already taken this step with respect to Vedic accents.

  

I have written the above श्री-वेंकटकृष्ण-शास्त्रिणं निमित्तीकृत्य. The underlying intention I have is to urge the members of this forum to avoid "Bollywood" or newspaper-like transliterations in their posts. Only five or six signs need to be added to the Roman/Latin script in order to make it capable of representing most of Sanskrit. Why Indian Sanskritists, who can memorize so many texts so easily, do not remember to use those signs puzzles me.

  

Having a common style sheet for printing Sanskrit works is also a need of long standing. Even if only this much of initiative is taken, the number of 'misses' the users of electronic data bases experience will come down considerably.

  

9\. The 'us-and-they' stance implicit in the references to Western scholars made on this forum is unfortunate. That words such as "Western" are convenient labels --unavoidable but distorting generalization; the West is not a monolith -- should not be forgotten. While every translation or interpretation misrepresents the original to a certain extent, it also helps in asking illuminating questions. We need the 'other' to understand ourselves more precisely. If Western scholars had not entered Sanskrit studies, we probably would not have had even the alphabetically arranged dictionaries that we find so convenient (taking up lexemes in the alphabetical order of their finals is found in a few Sanskrit ko;sas, but I have not come across an alphabetically arranged ko;sa).

  

a.a.
