Dear friends/ Scholars

Please visit website for conference details  

We are happy to announce that **Dr.P.M. SECT**, through its sub-unit **“Indian Society for Indic Studies**”, Vadodara, is organizing an international conference **“Ancient Indian Wisdom and Modern World” at Delhi, India.**

**Further,****We feel pleasure to inform you that we are getting very good response, from scholars of various fields of Oriental Studies, from all over the world, for participating in the Conference. We have members from other countries such as; Thailand, USA, Sri Lanka, Nepal etc. and still we are getting very good response from National and International scholars.**

**The main objectives of the*conference is*to present interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary approaches of research between scholars of various fields of ancient Indian Studies and modern Studies.The task facing us today is to reformulate the Indian traditions into the language of the twenty-first century. This requires reconceptualising problems and solutions of the Indian scriptures in a different way than how the academics often do. Thus, the basic things are that how we correlate various theories of Indian studies with modern concepts. In fact, there must be harmony between both in presentation of subject matter and. their applications in present system.Further, the Orientals knowledge is reach in the contents but they are lacking in their applications in practices. Therefore. thereis much need of perfect understanding between supporters of different schools of Indian traditions and also with modern concepts of science and technologies. It is very much important for interdisciplinaryand multidisciplinaryapproaches. Thus, we should think that if there are some substantial materials in ancient scriptures then what we can give to modern Studies.**

**With Due Regards**

**Conference Coordinator**
