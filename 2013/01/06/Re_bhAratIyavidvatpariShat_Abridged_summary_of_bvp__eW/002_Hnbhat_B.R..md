It simply means the words of Hari -

  

saying:

  

भक्तानां हृदयं शान्तं सश्रियो मे प्रियं गृहम्। वसामि तत्र शोभैव वैकुण्ठाख्यादिवर्णना

  

The heart of my peaceful heart of (my) devotees is dear house for me with Lakshmi. I live there. The description (praise) of Vaikuntha etc. is itself beautiful in it.

  

First please learn Sanskrit yourself enough to split the words correctly and then ask question. It is too simple in diction and composition to require any grammatical orthographic analysis as required by you.
