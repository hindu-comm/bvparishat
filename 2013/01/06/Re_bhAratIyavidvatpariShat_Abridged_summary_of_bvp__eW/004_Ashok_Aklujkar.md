Is the following SlOkam correct in terms of orthography, grammar, syntax, prosody, etc. ? What is its precise meaning? Is its author SReela Jeeva GOsvAmi?  
भक्तानां हृदयं शान्तं सश्रियो मे प्रियं गृहम् ।  
वसामि तत्र शोभैव वैकुण्ठाख्याद् इवर्णना ॥

Why are enclosing all the mails you received. Please change the subject line. Please learn to post. To know about top posting refer <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posting_style#Top-posting> ... before getting "samskR^ta-VidvAns and Vidushi-s!" involved  
in this exercise why don't you try them yourself. What is meant by " इवर्णना" I cannot understand. Bhaktivedanta have most of their works on the net. Please refer to Sanskritworld.in of Dhavalji document collection of Jeeva Goswamy जीव-गोस्वामी-सत्सन्दर्भ. Here is a quotation from Haribhaktisudhodaya उक्तं च हरिभक्तिसुधोदये. भक्तानां हृदयं शान्तं सश्रियो मे प्रियं गृहं । वसामि तत्र शोभैव वैकुण्ठाख्यादिवर्णना

It simply means the words of Hari - saying:भक्तानां हृदयं शान्तं सश्रियो मे प्रियं गृहम्। वसामि तत्र शोभैव वैकुण्ठाख्यादिवर्णना The heart of my peaceful heart of (my) devotees is dear house for me with Lakshmi. I live there. The description (praise) of Vaikuntha etc. is itself beautiful in it. First please learn Sanskrit yourself enough to split the words correctly and then ask question. It is too simple in diction and composition to require any grammatical orthographic analysis as required by you.

वर्णना can mean painting in the house also in addition to verbal description. Here is relates both to the house and the heart of the Bhakta-s.  
  

My thoughts:  
I support the spirit of the suggestions made by Ajit Gargeshwari and H.N. Bhat, although not all the words employed to convey them.  
  
In Dr. Bhat's translation in 3 the noun ;sobhaa is rendered as if it were an adjective. eva is taken as emphatic ("itself"), whereas it could also have been intended to exclude (something). The phrase "heart of my" is redundant in light of the following words and is probably just an oversight in typing. Also, it is unclear to me how the point he makes in 4 (var.nanaa relates both to the house and the heart of the bhaktas) applies. Let me, therefore, suggest another tr:  
  
"Of me, accompanied by Lak.smii, the dear house is the peaceful heart of (my) devotees (i.e., the house that Lak.smii and I really like is the tranquility-filled heart of the devotees). I (really) dwell there. The description beginning with the name Vaiku.n.tha is merely its beauty/decoration (i.e., the well-known way of speaking about my dwelling place simply conveys the attractiveness of that house; it does not denote the house itself)."  
  
a.a.
