What else do you want?

  

शिशुः स्वपिति।

माता शिशुं स्वापयति।

शिशुः सुप्तः

मात्रा शिशुः स्वापितः।  

  

These are the gradual stages. I could not see any other meaning than the transformation of causative into passive form from the previous sentence.

  

Only that ञि ष्वपा स्वप्ने is अकर्मकधातु. Accordingly the grammatical formations take place.
