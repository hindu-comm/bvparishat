Deae Dr. Misra,  
I thank you for the information. It did not help, however. The URL ultimately (Items 24) directs the user to the Internet Archive.where one has to sign up. Unlike the user friendly DLI the Interne Archive further directs you to Open Library where one has again to sign up. I gave up at that. Perhaps, I may try later, I do not know. My own copy, the Maheschandra Nyayaratna edition(Asiatic Soc., Calcutta) of the 1870s got damaged due to damp. It is aged If you remember the exact steps after or before the Open Library dialogue box that might help.  
With thanks again  
Best wishes  
DB
