G. N. Jha's English translation of Shabarabhashya is available on [archive.org](http://archive.org)  
<https://ia700509.us.archive.org/24/items/Shabara.Bhasya.tr.by.Ganganath.Jha/>  
  
The second file has the eighth chapter while the third one has chapters nine to twelve.  
  
The format is DjVu files, to view which you need a DjVu viewer. I use the free DjView which you can download from  
<http://djvu.sourceforge.net/djview4.html>  

  
Thanks, Nityanand
