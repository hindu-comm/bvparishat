Dear Colleagues,

Greetings on the Republic Day!

I have the Tantravārttika and Mm. G.N.Jha’s Engl. translation thereof with me. Could anyone tell if Śabarasvāmin’s Bhāṣya (VII-XII) and its translation by G.N.Jha are available on the internet? I could not download that from the DLI.

With thanks in advance

DB
