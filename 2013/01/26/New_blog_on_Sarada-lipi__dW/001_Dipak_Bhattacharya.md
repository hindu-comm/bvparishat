I have been working with the Śāradā manuscript of the Paippalāda-Saṃhitā for the last 36 years since I learned the script from late Pandit Dunichand Shastri of the Vishveshvaranand Institute, Hoshiarpur. Before that I had worked with a transcription made by the American scholar L.c.Barret.  
Śāradā script is not very difficult to learn. There are a few ligatures like ष्ठ/ष्ट, ण/जा where confusion is possible. Otherwise it is not very difficult to work with Śāradā. Such difficulties exist with every script. I know of at least three Western scholars who can handle Śāradā mss.  
Incidentally, the original manuscript of the Paippalāda-Saṃhitā deposited in the University Library, Tübingen was damaged beyond recovery during the second world-war. As I saw it the pages had been broken into two or more parts.
