I have updated the diagram accordingly to reflect this. I have also coloured the entities getting the पद संज्ञा in blue, those not getting the पद संज्ञा in brick red, and the पद rules which are not applicable along with the अनिष्टरूपs they would have produced had there been a पद संज्ञा in red.

Note that the complement of यच् (य् + all vowels) is is the वल् प्रत्याहार, used by Panini in Sutras लोपो व्योर्वलि (6-1-66) and आर्धधातुकस्येड् वलादेः (7-2-35). वल् includes all consonants except य्, hence it is the same as saying अयच्.  
  
For those interested, the XeLaTeX code for the diagram can be had from
