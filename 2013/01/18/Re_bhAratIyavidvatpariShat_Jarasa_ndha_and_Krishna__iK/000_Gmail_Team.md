Dear Dr. S Rani, Thanks for detailed reply. I appreciate your efforts. Dr RNI asked me the verses from the Mahabharata for second calamity on Kurus. My information is from the pages 29 and 30 of the book "Political History Ancient India" by Dr. H. Ray choudhuri. He gave reference of Chhandogya Upanis'at. This happened at the time of Janaka 1. Ushasti Chaakraayanfrom Kuru country participated in philosophical discussions in the court of Janaka1. For locust the word used is Matachi (Sanskritization of Kannada word-Midiche),Janaka1 flourished 200 years after Parikshit. I do not know if one expects this to be the part of the Mahabharata of Vyaasa. If some body says his Mahabharata is authentic relative to other books, then here is the question. There is the name of Yaaska in the present edition of MBH. (Appendix RayChoudhuri). This point was discussed before on BVparishat. Here is another question



The Mahabharata uses this term in the Dronaparvan:

**काम्भोजानांसहस्रैश्चशकानांचविशाम्पते।**

**शबराणांकिरातानांबर्बराणांतथैवच।।** (महाभारतम् 5-119-53)

The Mahabharata uses this term in the Dronaparvan:

**काम्भोजानांसहस्रैश्चशकानांचविशाम्पते।**

**शबराणांकिरातानांबर्बराणांतथैवच।।** (महाभारतम् 5-119-53)



How did Vyaasa know Shakas when they were not in India before 326 BC if all Mahabharata happened within the subcontinent. Dr. S. Rani also mentioned about Shakala Dvipa. Here is my question. Please tell me who were living in Shakala Dvipa and where exactly was located in the subcontinent. I am not trying to fix the time of MBH war. My efforts are to show kingdoms outside of the subcontinent were involved in the war. I find many MBH kingdoms outside of the subcontinent. Thanks. N>RJOSHI

Dear Prof. Joshi ji!

Namaste.

After going through your latest mail I felt a lot of necessity to explain certain aspects. But I have a fear of the need of writing a volume on this. Of course I have enough stamina to deliver my goods but the other commitments pull me from all sides back to divert my concentration else where. Still I shall make a little attempt here to do justice to my observations. At the out set I should state two things. 1. My efforts are not to disregard your valuable pursuits. 2. I feel these observations may be helpful in the present pursuit. From this stand point I believe I shall be encouraged to proceed to present my observations in more deal. Here I would like to deal with three aspects :  
1. Arjuna's Valor   
Arjuna was the most valorous and the most powerful warrior of his times as evidenced from the Mahabharata. It was not only Bhishma and Krishna but also Arjuna who played a major role in managing with the events of their times to establish Dharma.  
As the instances prove he never blindly used his weapons and astras against his enemies. He was most calculative in fighting with his foes. Otherwise had he used his Pasupata Astra, which has no parallel, it alone could have ended the war just in a span of Muhurta time as declared by Arjuna in Pandava's Camp before the commencement of War at the time of assessment of the abilities of the warriors on Pandava's side. He had a proved profile of his valor through the progress of the Mahabharata story.  
a) Arjuna's valor during Digvijaya at the time of Dharmaraja's
Rajasuya  
On this occasion Arjuna went to conquer the Northern regions set out in the chariot gifted to him by the God Agni, holding the Gandiva bow together with the inexhaustible quiver. During his victorious tour he defeated kings such as Pulinda, Pratividnhya, the ruler of Uluka, and the kings like Vamadeva, Modapura, Sudama, Insankula, Malava, Puandra, Kashmira, Trigarta king, Lohta, Sudhanva, kings of Gandhara, Kambhoja, Kosala, Rishikulya and of the region of Manasa lake. More over He conquered Sakala Dwipa (One of the 7 Dwipas of the Earth) along with all its 9 upadwipas. Particularly his war with Bhagadatta of Pragjyothisha needs a special mention too. He gave a tough fight of eight days and defeated that most powerful king Bhagadatta who had demonic skills and had peace treaty with him. At the time of fighting with Bhagadatta, the armies of China, Kirata Desa and other tribal kingdoms surrounding Pragajyotisha also stood on the side of Bhagadattha and were defeated by Arjuna. On the same occasion Arjuna defeated all the rulers of Lower, Upper and Middle Himalaya regions. All this account was very clearly depicted in the Rajasuya Digvijaya Upa Parva of Mahabharata.  
b) Other Victories of Arjuna  
The victory of Arjuna over Karna, Duryodhana and others at the time of Draupadi Svayamvara, his victory over Drupada as Gurudakshina to Drona (in the hands of which king all Karna, Duryodhana and others met with a clean defeat), his victory over Gandharvas at the time of Duryodhana's Ghoshayatra, his combat with lord Shiva, his victory over All Kauravas including Bhishma at the time of Gograhana as a sign of his future victory in the great Mahabharata war are all some illustrations of his extra ordinary skills and strength as a warrior par excellence.  
c) His vicotory over all the regions on the other side of the River Ganges at the time of post war Ashvamedha Sacrifice of Yudhisthira  
On this occasion also Arjuna once again toured around the regions of Trigartha, Pragjotisha during the rule of Vajradatta (the son of Bhagadatta), Magadha, Sindh, Gandhara etc. and conquered them all. At this time only he had to fight against his son Bhabhruvahana who was ruling Manipura  
2. Babhruvahana's combat with Arjuna   
Yes, I admit the fact that Babhruvahana was the son of Chtrangada one of the wives of Arjuna. But he was encouraged by Uluchi (also called Ululupi by some people), the Naga wife of Arjuna, to fight against Arjuna.Chitrangada too exhorted him. As a result there was a great fight between them in which eventually Arjuna and Babhruvahana fell on the battle field having been severely struck by shafts released simultneously by each other, particularly Arjuna had to fell down dead. By the power of Uluchi they got back their senses.Then Uluchi explained them all about the curse of the Ganges on the fall of Bhishma, according to which, Arjuna had to face this situation of meeting death in the hands of his Son and just by the Mohini Shakti o Uluchi he was saved from the danger. This is all because of the curse of Ganga and not really due to the valor of Babhruvahana. This account is there in the Mahabharata of Vyasa.  
  
Here I would like to say that Only this episode of combat between Arjuna and Babhruvana is available in the Mahabharta. But the other stories like that of Pramila (The women's kingdom etc.) were not parts of the Mahabharata of Vyasa. For your kind information Jaiminiya Bharata was not another version of the Mahabharata. It was not even written by
Jaimini but was written by some one else and popularized in the name of Jaimini as evidences show.  
Moreover you please verify my earlier mail. I didn't say that there was no women's kingdom in the world in ancient times. My only claim was that Arjuna was not defeated in the hands of Pramila according to the Mahabharata of Veda Vyasa.  
  
3. About the Strength of Kuru Race and Arjuna's Descendants  
Nor even I spoke about the stregnth of Kurus. In my previous mail no where I mentioned the KURUS were the strongest of all rulers of their times. My sole concern was about Arjuna's of valor only. Contextually I have to speak much about other particulars of the Kuru race and their valor.I will take another occasion to detail it. Of course as you said the valor and strength of Pandavas was not ended just with Janamejaya and with the attack of swarm of locust during the times of Janamejaya. I have a clean record of 21 generations of Arjuna's descendants with me which I cannot present here in our passing discussions of this kind. It needs a very serious deal. So I shall reveal it in a book form very soon when time permits.  
Here I conclude that there are hundreds of more facts to prove the valor and energies of Arjuna. A keen study of the Mahabharata is necessary for appreciation.  
Regards,  



**Dr. Rani Sadasiva Murty**

Dear Dr Sadasivsmurty Rani,



Thanks for your input.



I have no problem with your posting on Krishna, Jarasandha, Kaalayavana, Dvaraka, and Mucukunda. However I would like to bring your attention the following information.



You posted ,"But here I would like to place my observation that the story of Arjuna's death in the hands of Ulupi's son, or the Kingdom of Pramila and the Episode of Hansadhvaja are all parts of Jaiminiya Bharata but are not found in the Vyasa's Mahabharata (up to Svargarohana parava).. Jaminiya Bharata doesn't enjoy the status of an ITIHASA as Vyasa's Mahabharata does and it is much more considered as a fictitious composition. So any of the episodes from it cannot be considered authentic."



It is personal choice to decide which book of the Mahabharata is authentic. First Babhruvahana was the son of the lady Chitrangada. He was not the son of Ulupi.



Next one cannot deny the existence of Ladies Kingdom of Pramila. Archaeological excavations in the Sinkyang province of China has unearthed the Ladies Kingdom. This is known all over the world. In 2009 Houston Museum of Fine Arts with the permission of the Afghanistan government brought all artifacts to USA and displayed them in the museum for months.



Main parties of Mahabharata conflicts were concentrated in the west in the lands now occupied by Pakistan and Afghanistan. Also one cannot deny existence of Naaga people in the ancient India. Takshaka was Naaga so was Ulupi.



For your information Kurus were not powerful all the time. King Samvarana (father of Kuru) has to run away from his enemies and hide around the Sindhu river. Could you please tell me from which direction Samvarana and his people reached Sindhu from the east of Sindhu or from the west of Sindhu? One time Shalvas drove away Kurus from Kurukshetra. After Janamejaya Paarikshit Kurus suffered their second misfortune due to locusts. It is only due the power of Bhisma and help of Krishna Kurus prospered for short time less that hundred years. Your input is appreciated. Thanks. N.R.Joshi.

Pranams to all.  
The on going discussion on Jasrasandha and also on the prowess of Kurus and the people on the other side of the river Ganga is interesting.
