Vidvadbhyo Namaha  
  
Many English words have Sanskrit origins. Like Pitru is Father, Matru is Mother, Sunu is Son, Duhitru is Daughter, Bhratru is Brother.  
  
Like this I was thinking Home is originally Homa in Sanskrit. Yajna is a large scale ritual for welfare of kingdom like Ashwamedha Yajna, Rajasuya and others.  
Yajnas cannot be done at home but in large open fields. But Homa is a small scale fire ritual. It can be done at home. Aupasana Homa is a daily Homa. It  
is performed at Home. Many Yajnas are given in Srauta Sutras. Many Homas are given in Grihya Sutras. This may be origin of English word Home. How far this analysis is correct?
