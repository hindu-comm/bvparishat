Dear Sirs,  
  
Since many years I am trying know the earliest usage of the word  
"saMskRti" as an equivalent of "Culture". I am rather sure that this  
was a later development and in none of our classical texts we have  
such an equation. If so, pl let me know get enlightened.  
  
  
regards  
  
ganesh
