The word was used in at least in Marathi till 1924. In that year Rabindranath Tagore after consultation with some linguists (may be S.K.Chatterji) imported the word into Bengali.Then it spread to Hindi, Oriya and other languages.  
The use of the word k.r.s.ti in that sense is very old and Sanskritic.
