Dear Dr. Ramanujan,



I would urge a bit more caution in drawing conclusions from the existing situation and the namesAndhra pATha and drAviDa pATha. It is entirely possible that these names are newer monikers given to two sub-branches within the taittirIya branch. I can well understand a tendency to say that the so-called drAviDa pATha is older/more correct. Ramanuja's vedArthasangraha has at least one argument based on that pATha of thenArAyaNa sUkta (which he calls anuvAka). Sankara and Sayana also seem to have the drAviDa pATha in mind when they comment.



However, there are other points of variation between the so-called drAviDa and Andhra pATha-s, none of which corresponds neatly with smArtaand (SrI)vaishNava sampradAya-s, nor with Andhra-deSa and drAviDa-deSa for that matter. For that matter,the differences in pATha-s are also not confined only to the last taittirIya AraNyaka chapter beginning with ambhasya pAre.



To cite just one example, for the much recited SAnti mantra, the drAviDa pATha reads, "tvam eva pratyaksham brahmAsi. tvAm eva pratyaksham brahma vadishyAmi." The accusative "tvAm" in the second vAkya above is grammatically correct and is also the reading that Sankara recognizes in his commentary on the first two vallI-s of thetaittirIya upanishat.



Instead, both smArta and SrIvaishNava reciters from drAviDa-deSa often recite, "tvam eva pratyaksham brahmAsi. tvam eva pratyaksham brahma vadishyAmi." The nominative "tvam" in the second vAkya is what is called the Andhra pATha, butI have heard this version recited by karNATa and mahArAshTra deSa origin people as well. Indeed, the drAviDa pATha version of this SAnti mantraseems, at least to me, the minority version currently and what is now called the Andhra pATha is not unique to Andhra, not special to smArta-s alone,nor alien to vaishNavasampradAya vaidika-s from the drAviDa region proper.



And it is not easy to say that nominative "tvam" in the Andhra pATha is wrong ora pramAda pATha either, because the same reciters have also maintained the accusative tvAm in a closely related context, i.e. "tvAm eva pratyaksham brahmAvAdisham" in the corresponding SAnti mantra that is in the past tense. Now why would an entire recitation tradition, nowcalled theAndhra pATha, change an original "tvAm" to the currently recited "tvam" in the first SAnti mantra with vadishyAmi but retain an original"tvAm" in the closely related second mantra with avAdisham?



Other than saying "that is just the way it is (or has always been, at least within living memory)for that recitation tradition," can one say more? And in reality, for so many of the variant readings available in the veda, "that is just the way they are (or have always been)," aren't they?



Regards,

Vidyasankar
