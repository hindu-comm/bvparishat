\> To cite just one example, for the much recited SAnti mantra, the drAviDa pATha reads, "tvam eva pratyaksham brahmAsi. tvAm eva pratyaksham brahma vadishyAmi." The accusative "tvAm" in the second vAkya above is grammatically correct and is also the reading that Sankara recognizes in his commentary on the first two vallI-s of the taittirIya upanishat.  
\>  
\> Instead, both smArta and SrIvaishNava reciters from drAviDa-deSa often recite, "tvam eva pratyaksham brahmAsi. tvam eva pratyaksham brahma vadishyAmi." The nominative "tvam" in the second vAkya is what is called the Andhra pATha, but I have heard this version recited by karNATa and mahArAshTra deSa origin people as well. Indeed, the drAviDa pATha version of this SAnti mantra seems, at least to me, the minority version currently and what is now called the Andhra pATha is not unique to Andhra, not special to smArta-s alone, nor alien to vaishNava sampradAya vaidika-s from the drAviDa region proper.  
  

This is what Bannanje Govindacharya says in this regard (in a footnote to his edition of Madhva's commentary on the तैत्तिरीयोपनिषत् based on the हृषिकेशतीर्थीय manuscripts):  
  
यद्यपि "त्वमेव प्रत्यक्षं ब्रह्म वदिष्यामि" इति वैदिकाः पठन्ति व्याचक्षते च \| तथाऽपि श्रीहृषीकेशतीर्थादिभिः "त्वामेव" इत्येव पाठः पठितः \| व्यासतीर्थीयव्याख्यानेऽप्येवं दृश्यते \| तथा शाङ्करादिष्वपि "त्वामेव" इति पाठस्यैव परिग्रहणं स्फुटम् \|  
  
Later in respect of ब्रह्मवर्चसेनाद्येन सुवर्गेण लोकेन … he writes:  
  
यद्यपि वैदिकाः "सुवर्ग्येण" इति पाठं पठन्ति \| तथाऽपि बहूनां भाष्यकाराणां तद्व्याख्यातॄणां च "सुवर्गेण" इत्येव पाठः सम्मत इति समादृतः \|  
  
It is not clear if the distinction between आन्ध्रपाठ and द्राविडपाठ (which I do not know about) was on his mind or not. It is well known that there are multiple recensions of the वाजसनेयी शुक्लयजुर्वेद (as even noted in the ब्रह्मसूत्रs), so it is not unlikely that such is also the case of the तैत्तिरीय.
