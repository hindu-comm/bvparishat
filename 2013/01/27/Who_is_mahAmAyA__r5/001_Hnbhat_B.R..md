I do not know any sampradaya, but Shakta, Vaishnava, and each may have their own siddhanta-s, laying the emphasis on their own postulations.

  

Here is a line from Naradiya Purana,

  

१. ब्राह्मी २.माहेश्वरी चैव ३. कौमारी४.वैष्णवी तथा ।।  
५-६ वाराहींद्राणी ७ चामुंडा महालक्ष्मीस्वरूपिणी ।। ८९-५० ।।  

  

and which accords with the incarnation of Mahamaya, as the aggregate power of gods, as per the Markandeya Purana, सप्तशती, divivided into महालक्ष्मी, माहासरस्वती, महाकाली into three as the deities of the three sections. Other Purana-s may have different narration and legends.

  

Amara considers as the the सप्त मातरः। irrespective of any संप्रदाय as he is a Bauddha or Jaina, as popularly believed. The above Naradiya Purana, emphasis is on the Vaishnavaite part, as the incarnation of Mahalakshmi, the 7 others. Shakta versions may have different legends, than Markandeya Purana which describes the seven incarnations separately as of Mahamaya. I don't see any need to divide Mahamaya, or classify other than this, according to the traditions. Tantric versions may have a different Account to offer. Shakti, the counter part of Trinity Brahma, Vishnu, Maheshvara are justly called as ब्राह्मी, वैष्णवी, माहेश्वरी in general. And not otherwise, Mahamaya, divided into three separately. This is a general view.
