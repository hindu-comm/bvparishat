Namaste  
  
In the LakshmInarasimha-sahasranAma there is a name: महामायाप्रसूतः  
  
<http://www.prapatti.com/slokas/english/lakshmiinrisimhasahasranaamam.pdf>  
  
mah¯adev¯aya dev¯aya m¯atuli ˙ngadhar¯aya ca  
*maha¯ma¯ya¯prasu¯ta¯ya* prastuta¯ya ca ma¯yine  52  
  
//who are the origin of the mahä-mäyä potency //(mahä-mäyä-prasüta),  
  
I find the name महामायायै नमः in the Lakshmi, Saraswati and Durga/Gauri list of names too. There is also a Temple for Lakshminarayana Mahamaya in Akola, Karnataka. I would like to know if the MahAmAyA that is said to be born out of / created by Narasimha is also His consort. But then Saraswati and Gauri too have that name. I request scholars to clarify whether Shiva and Brahma too created a certain MahAmAyA.  
  
From one viewpoint it can easily be said that MahAmAyA is One Primordial Shakti which alone appears as different forms of deities. But are there other viewpoints held in different sampradayas?
