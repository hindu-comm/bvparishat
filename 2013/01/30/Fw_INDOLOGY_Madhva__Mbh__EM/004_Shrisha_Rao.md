\> Dear sir  
\> Pl. See the publication announcement made by in 2009 on the new comm. on mbtn by govindacharya. There are many detailed translations in kannada and it is totally impossible for anybody to work on mbtn unless he is conversant in kannada.  
  

Also, the Sanskrit commentaries of जनार्दन भट्ट and वादिराजस्वामी on the MBTN, and the महाभारत-लक्षालङ्कार of the latter which is an independent exposition of the epic itself, have all been independently published within the past decade or so.  
  
Regards,
