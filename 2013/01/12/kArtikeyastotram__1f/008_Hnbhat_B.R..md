Thanks for defending अव्ययीभाव on the lexicon records of ऊष which justifies the reading प्रतूषम्।

  

And,\*'क्रियाविशेषणानां\* कर्मत्व क्लीवत्व च' इति कात्यायनवचनम्, 'सामान्ये नपुंसकम्।' इति क्रियाविशेषणानां प्रायेण नियमः। अव्ययीभाव, the द्वितीया "अम्" and the substitute "अम्" are both will be having their place and the form प्रत्यूषम् can be justified. In this case, there is no option for प्रत्यूषे as क्रियाविशेषण. Otherwise, if it is for सप्तमी, it is optional, as per "तृतीयासप्तम्योर्बहुलम्" which makes the other form also justifiable. On the other hand, as a noun, itself, the form also can be justified as प्रत्यूषे as the simple सप्तमी, without वीप्सा and without अव्ययीभाव.

  

Hope this stand can be accepted to justify both the readings, but with different shades of meaning slightly. In short both readings are acceptable grammatically, as अव्ययीभाव or without अव्ययीभाव compound.
