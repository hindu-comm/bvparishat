ऊषं क्लीबे प्रभातम्। पश्यन्तु शब्दकपल्द्रुमे।  
The word ऊषम् is indeed listed in Sabdakalpadrumah (in neuter gender) and also Monier Williams (both masculine and neuter) as a word dawn.

If it were अव्ययीभाव, both could have been correct, ऊषे ऊषे > इति प्रतूषम्, प्रत्यूषे both are alternative forms, as per > तृतीयासप्तम्योर्बहुलम्‌ । (2-4-84) due to the substitution optionally > for सप्तमी अम्.

I think ऊषे ऊषे makes sense here, (s)he who reads the names "every morning", becomes a Vachaspati. In many Phalasrutis, one comes across the emphasis on repeating chanting of Mantras or verses.  
  
यथा दिने दिने इति प्रतिदिनम्  
तथैव ऊषे ऊषे इति प्रत्यूषम्  
वीप्सार्थकाव्ययीभावसमासः  
अव्ययमिदं क्रियाविशेषणं न तु कर्मेति प्रतिभाति मे  
  
एतेनान्वयः  
इति मदीयानि अष्टाविंशतिनामानि श्रद्धया युक्तः यः प्रत्यूषं (ऊषे ऊषे इति अर्थात्प्रतिदिनं प्रभातकाले) पठेत्स मूकः (अपि इत्यध्याहार्यः) वाचस्पतिर्भवेत्

I think it is with पठति as a क्रियाविशेषण, while श्रद्धया युक्तः is a विशेषण for सः.
