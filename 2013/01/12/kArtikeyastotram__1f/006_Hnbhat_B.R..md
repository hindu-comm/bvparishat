I think the above does not apply in this case, as the usage here is प्रत्यूषं is not related with any intransitive verb अकर्मकधातु, but directly related with पठति, which has the अष्टाविंशतिनामानि मदीयानि related to it as the complete sentence in the verse gives:

  

  

अष्टाविंशतिनामानि मदीयानीति यः पठेत् ।

प्रत्यूषम् श्रद्धया युक्तो मूको वाचस्पतिर्भवेत् ॥

  

the total meaning being Any one who thus recites my twenty eight names with devotion, in the early morning, will become eloquent orator (even if he is dumb).

  

Here the pinch is a dumb cannot recite the names and how he can become eloquent speaker? So even if he is not a good speaker, is intended really.

  

Or it may be even) A dumb becomes श्रद्धया युक्तः, in the morning, recites these my twenty eight names will become eloquent speaker. The idea is the same as मूकं करोति वाचालं पङ्गुं लङ्घयते गिरिम्। यत्कृपा तमहं वन्दे परमानन्दमाधवम्॥ which does not specify any specific period to become with devotion for the dumb or the lame. Here as it appears, A Muka, if becomes यो मूकः प्रत्यूषं श्रद्धया युक्तः भवति, मदीयानि नामानि पठति, वाचस्पतिर्भवेत्। will be the अन्वय as explained by Prof. Girish Jha. he will recite these names, and become वाचस्पति.

  

Otherwise it is impossible to relate, any one with devotion, *recites these names in the morning,* for the reason mentioned above पठति is not अकर्मकधातु.

  

Even it could have been प्रत्यूषम् as अव्ययीभाव, which is not the case as the quotation from Amara itself, gives, "प्रत्यूषोऽहर्मुखं" the meaning as the day break for the word as a whole derived, as प्रत्यूषति - रुजति कामुकान् इति प्रत्यूषः, as per "इगुपधज्ञाप्रीकिरः कः" (3-1-135) from the verb (भ्वादि ४४५) prefixed with प्रति as given by Bhanuji Dikshita, and not an अव्ययीभाव with ऊष, which requires ऊष itself a word meaning morning or day like ऊषे ऊषे प्रत्यूषम्। which is not found in lexicons independently for the day break. Hence the possibility is less. (not impossible, but not recorded in lexicons. If it were अव्ययीभाव, both could have been correct, ऊषे ऊषे इति प्रतूषम्, प्रत्यूषे both are alternative forms, as per तृतीयासप्तम्योर्बहुलम्‌ । (2-4-84) due to the substitution optionally for सप्तमी अम्. In the absence of substitution, it will be प्रत्यूषे.

  

And the other possibility for justifyinjg प्रत्यूषम् as द्वितीया,
"कालाध्वनोरत्यन्तसंयोगे"(2-3-5) which needs complete day break, for श्रद्धा or पठन as the case may be. This has been rejected by Prof. Korada in his reply:

  

<https://groups.google.com/d/msg/bvparishat/1fYgc3KUOCw/k1DIZO0LbM4J>  

  

which did not consider the possibility of अत्यन्तसंयोग with the क्रिया - in the previous line, पठति, but has taken it related with श्रद्धया युक्तः. as श्रद्धा is a गुण as अभिहित. But the पठति can be related as having अत्यन्तसंयोग with प्रत्यूष, making it to give meaning, who recites whole duration of the day break, which can justify the द्वितीया।

  

More analysis can be given by different combinations. But if one wants to justify both the readings, the above analysis would be certainly help. The point of difference is whether प्रत्यूष is related with पठति or श्रद्धया युक्तः.
