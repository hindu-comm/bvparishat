Respected scholars,  

It could premature to be assumed that Ūṣaṃ is not available in the sense of morning in lexicons. The शब्दरत्नावली has been quoted in the शब्दकल्पद्रुमः as the meaning given as प्रभातम् and ऊष रुजायाम्- (भ्वादिः, परस्मैपदी) ऊषति. In masculine gender Pratūṣaḥ is used in the sense of morning by Amara (1.4.2) could be derived in the following प्रादिसमासः way: प्रत्यूषति रुजति कामुकानिति। प्रति+ऊष रुजायाम् having the क suffix. In the masculine gender शब्दरत्नावली says: सूर्यः the sun.  
Ūṣaḥ in masculine having the meanings of क्षारमृत्तिका (alkaline earth), कर्णविलम् (ear cavity), and चन्दनाद्रिः (Malaya Mountain)  
Ūṣā in feminine gender is having the meaning of Aniruddha's wife Uṣā.  
To have the meaning of morning only the gender difference is apparent in अमरकोषः and शब्दरत्नावली. So we have both Pratūṣaḥ and Pratūṣaṃ recorded in the meaning of morning.

Regards,

Narayanan
