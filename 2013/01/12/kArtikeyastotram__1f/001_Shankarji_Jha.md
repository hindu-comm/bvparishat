Swasti, Word 'Pratyushe' seems to be correct, as this is a complete or full-fleged word in itself and not under the Avyayibhaava Samasa as it looks to be due to the existence the Upasarga Upa there. By the by, In Pauranika and Stotra literature (includind Ramayana and Mahabharata) we find several Apaanineeya versions. Thanks,
