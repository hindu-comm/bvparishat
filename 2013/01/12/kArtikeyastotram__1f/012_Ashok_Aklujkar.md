As in many other word/meaning history discussions that have taken place on the BVP, one needs to take into the explanations given by modern historical linguistics along with those by the grammarians in the Sanskrit tradition.

  

The prati- compounds are particularly tricky to deal with, since prati can convey 'opposition' as well as 'resemblance, correspondence' and the attested forms can be avyayii-bhaavas or tat-puru.sas. Please see my2012essay:"The word *pratya:nga* in Pata\~jali's Vyåkara∫a-mahåbhåΩya." In *Studies in Sanskrit Grammars,* pp. 1-86. (eds) Cardona, George; Aklujkar, Ashok; Ogawa, Hideyo. New Delhi: D.K. Printworld.

  

The length of the vowel and the 'masculine : neuter' gender difference are frequently not as important in historical understanding as the consonants and contextually borne out referential meanings.

  

Probably [pratyuu.sa](http://pratyuu.sa) originally meant 'one like the u.sas, the counterpart of u.sas' and specifically stood for the second or slightly later stage of day-break or day-light. Specific meanings have frequently become generalized meanings ('morning' or 'morning in general' in the present case) as Sanskrit became a classical language.
