Dr. Moharir,

  

The explanation you advance in the following is good. So also the analogy. I am not convinced by the last proposition. It seems more likely to me that the law of excluded middle that is so widely present in scientific thinking (it should be so present at most levels of philosophizing/theorizing), rather than idol worship, makes the scientists and philosophers miss the 'template' possibility, but that should not affect your main point.

  

The resistance to the [sad-asad-vilak.sa.na](http://sad-asad-vilak.sa.na) proposition or khyaati may also stem from the same acculturization that we undergo as thinkers (I am not saying that the resistance is something to be viewed negatively or has a single cause; it only suggests that in our philosophization we arrive at a point which militates against the starting point, which development, naturally, cannot find universal acceptance; some philosophers will accept it and some will resist.

  

a.a.

I think rather than thinking it as "A" OR/AND "THE" GOD particle, if one looks at this issue as a TEMPLATE then thing this puzzle can be resolved. To me the clue comes fromतत्सृष्टवा तदेवानु प्रaविशत्

  

A goods example is various Blood Groups O, A, B AB (Positive & Negative)  

  

Blood Group O is a universal donor, where as AB is a Universal Acceptor.  

  

Template of theses groups and their formation comes out of evolution.
The TEMPLATE itself is never destroyed. though what the template creates (RBC) gets perished every 90 days. That is why Diabetic individuals measure Hemoglobin A1c rather than just the fasting glucose. It is a medical fact we do not have a single cell that we were born with all the cells of the entire body is re-created from the original template.  

  
Thus the Template always remains eternal for the individual entity (animal, plant ...... etc) where as the individual live through the respective time cycles. (जातस्य हि ध्रुवो मृत्यु)  
  

Hope this helps clarify the concept of "Creator" that remains "Separate" while remaining an "Integral part of the Same".

  

I think our difficulty in understanding this concept arises out of having created the rigid structures around the concept of God with specific attributes that resulted in the iconic idol worship.
