Dear Sati Shankar,



Please do not quote. There are different opinions on Veda Samhitas and their meanings. The stand of Poorva Mimamsa is that there is no history in Rigveda. But many scholarstake names like Sudasa, Divodasa, Trasadasyu, Purukutsa, Devaapi, Abhyavartin Caayamaana, Kavi Caayamaana, Anu, Druhyu, Pooru and many other names as names of the historical persons and tribes.Other scholarslike to find esoteric meaning in each and every word from Veda Samhitaa. Who to believe? As I wrote before hermeneutic (your meaning is as good as my meaning) etymology is different from linguistic etymology. There is no limit to the esoteric symbolism. If I said to you the word water has two meanings-one that we drink and other that it is life, even god. Without water, air, fire, food we cannot survive. They are all Devas to us. Will you deny? If you say water is hydrogen and oxygen. I say the god became that for our benefit. Will you deny that? No limit to esoteric symbolism. For this reason I turned to VarNavaada. There is something logical to talk there.Thanks. N.R.Joshi

Sir,

Your referral,""They say there are seven layers of meanings in Vedas" is very important in many respect....will you please suggest some reference to this statement...it can be an effective quote.

regards

Sati Shankar
