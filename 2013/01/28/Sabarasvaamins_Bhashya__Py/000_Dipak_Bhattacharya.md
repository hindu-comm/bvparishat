Dear Dr. Bhat,  
I convey my gratitude to you and to Dr. Nityananda Sastri for the help offered. No, I spent a long time yesterday on both the links, sent by you and by Dr. Sastri, but had to postpone the efforts. For the time being I shall do with the Central Library of the University and an old copy of Pandit Bhutanatha Saptatirtha's faithful Bengali translation and copious notes. As I already told, my own copy of Śabara has been damaged beyond recovery. In any case I expect to be successful in getting Śabara on Mi.Su.7-12 when I can devote myself to the task after some urgent works have been fully attended to. I am used to delayed success with obstinate links. And I will inform both of you after having success.  
Till then warm regards  
Sincerely  
DB
