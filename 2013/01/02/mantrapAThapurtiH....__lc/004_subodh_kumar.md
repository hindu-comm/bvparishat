Manyu in common parlance is translated as anger. But मन्यु stands for well considered anger against evil doers. Entire Bhagwat Geeta can be considered as Lord's exhortation for Manyu to fight a just war.

There are two Sookts in Rig Veda on Mnyu. These two are found repeated in Atharv Ved also. My interpretation of Manyu Sookts in Vedas is attached herewith for the learned scholars to consider and comment.

With best regards,

Subodh Kumar
