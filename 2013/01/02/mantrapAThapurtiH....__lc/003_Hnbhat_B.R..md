The context has to be born in mind. मनुः is interpreted as मानसं प्रज्वलनम्, कोपः as it is popularly interpreted. This is addressed to सुरा. or some other ingredients listed in the beginning prescribed in the rietes in the Brahmana texts. The total of the yajus- are used in सौत्रामणी, १०-२०-२१ as the अङ्ग of अग्नि. I am not unable to give more explanation. But for certain, all the words are commonly used in their popular sense as they are requested to be conferred धेहि in the person reciting these "mantra"s. Hence the locative.

  

तेजोऽसि।

मयि तेजो धेहि addressed to the ingredient representing तेजः etc.

  

"धाञ् धारणपोषणयोः" either to increase or confer upon and hence मयि तेजो धेहि। and so on in all the sentences and not देहि printed in the first set.

  

देहि would naturally l should take चतुर्थी, as per the common rule for दाञ् दाने especially, unless you take it as छान्दस. But my guess is correct as can be seen in the image of the text and the commentary.

  

I am not adding more grammatical details as yourself are a grammarian. Just tried to make my statement clear.

  

It is the reference from ShuklaYajurveda Madhyandina 19.9 and could not be found in Krishna Yajurveda - Taittiriya samhita.

  

With regards
