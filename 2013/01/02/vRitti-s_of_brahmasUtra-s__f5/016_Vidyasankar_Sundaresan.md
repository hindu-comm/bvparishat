Dear Sri Narayanan,

  

In this list, the following should NOT be described as sub-commentaries on the SAnkarabhAshya on brahmasUtra-s. They are independent texts, drawing upon the bhAshya, no doubt, but the authors explore various advaita vedAnta discussions according to their own schema, without sticking to the letter of the sUtra and bhAshya in sequence. Even the vaiyAsika nyAyamAlA (also called adhikaraNa ratnamAlA) of mAdhava-vidyAraNya is not strictly a sub-commentary on the sUtra-bhAshya, but a listing/description of the various adhikaraNa-s in the brahmasUtras in an independent poetic style. Many old printed editions of the brahmasUtra-s and the SAnkara bhAshya insert the couplets of this work wherever one adhikaraNa transitions to the next (as per the tradition of the advaita school).

  

Additionally, is there a text called brahmAnandIya by madhusUdana sarasvatI? The title sounds like the author should be someone called brahmAnanda, In fact, there is a well known commentary on madhusUdana's advaitasiddhi by one gauDabrahmAnanda sarasvatI, called laghucandrikA, also known as gauDabrahmanandI or simply as brahmAnandI.
