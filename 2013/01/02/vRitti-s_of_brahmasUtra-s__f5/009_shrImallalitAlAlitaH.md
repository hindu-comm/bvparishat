Thanks to all members for posting helpful informations and showing preparedness to contribute to my project.

Now I've these books with me:  
1. vedAntasUtramuktAvalI of shrIgauDabrahmAnanda from AnandAshrama.  
2. brahmatattvaprakAshikA of shrI sadAshiva brahmendra from trivendram Sanskrit series.  
3. brahmavidyAbharaNam of advaitAnanda from kumbhaghoNam.  
4. brahmasUtravRittiH of haridIxita AnandAshrama.  
5. dIpikA of shrI sha\~NkarAnanda from AnandAshrama.  
6. brahmAmRitavarShiNI of shrI rAmAnanda sarasvatI from chowkhambA.

These all are soft copies downloaded from DLI and archive.

I need even more names. Please suggest if you know. It need not be published. We will try to procure manuscripts if informed about location of library, etc.

To add to this,  
There is a commentary of bhAmatI, RijuprakAshikA, which we think it's very helpful in understanding the bhAmatI. It was published by shrI anantakRishNa shAstrI with other eight or nine commentaries. Rest was never published. We hope to find the original manuscript in some library, most probably from Calcutta or puNe. I request people, who are in these cities or have access to manuscript libraries to come forward to help me.
