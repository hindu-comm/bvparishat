To these lists, I would add a few more, relatively less known, Advaitic commentaries on the Brahmasūtras:

  

Bhaṭṭoji Dīkṣita - Tattvakaustubha

  

Haridīkṣita - Brahmasūtravṛtti

  

Annambhaṭṭa-Brahmasūtravṛtti-Mitākṣara-Madras-Oriental-Series  

  

Brahmasutra Vritti - Sadāśivendra Sarasvatī 1909  

  

Brahmasūtras-w-Brahmāmṛtavarṣiṇī-&-Dīpikā
