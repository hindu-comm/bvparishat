Lalitaalaalitaacharyebhyo namah.  
I suggest a few names of authors and their commentaries on the Sankarabhashya-the school of Kevala Advaita propagated by Sankaracharya:  
Anandagiri's Nyayanirnaya,  
Padmapada's Pancapadika,  
Suresvara's Naishkarmyasiddhi,  
Citsukha's Bhashaybhaavaprakashika,  
Vacaspati's Bhamati,  
Amalananda's Kalpataru,  
Sarvajnatmamuni's Sankshepasariraka,  
Prakasatman's Vivarana,  
Sriharsha's Kahndanakhandakhadya,  
Madhava's Pancadasi, Jivanmuktaviveka and Vaiyasikanyayamala,  
Sadananda's Vedantasara,  
Dharmarajadhvari's Vedantaparibhasha,  
Madhusudanasarasvati's Advaitasiddhi and Brahmanandiya  
Appayya's Parimala, Nyayarakshamani and Siddhantalesasangraha,  
Advaitananda's Brahmavidyabharana,  
Govindananda's Ratnaprabha  
I do not know all these are available or not. I have only seen Bhamati, Kalpataru and Parimala on the Sutra-Bhashya. I am sorry for repetition if all these works are already in your collection in the form of manuscripts or prints.  
Regards,  
Narayanan
