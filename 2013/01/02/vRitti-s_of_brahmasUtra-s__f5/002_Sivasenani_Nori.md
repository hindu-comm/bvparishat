नत्वा यतिम्, निवेदयति शिवसेनानीः।



ब्रह्मामृतवर्षिणी by Ramananda yati (Varanasi Dharmasuri in Purva Asrama, cited as Raamakinkara in the Anandashrama edition), published by Anandasrama and Chaukhamba Sanskrit Series (presently available under the title Vedant Darshan). I also heard (from a respected scholar) the Bhashyaratnaprabhaa being attributed to the author of Brahmaamritavarshinee, but am not sure that such is the case. The Anandasrama edition has Deepika by Sankaraananda in addition to the Brahmaamritravarshini. I remember downloading this from Archive.org but am unable to find it again. Anyway, I have both the Chaukhamba printed edition and the ebook of Anandashrama. Would be more than happy to share.
