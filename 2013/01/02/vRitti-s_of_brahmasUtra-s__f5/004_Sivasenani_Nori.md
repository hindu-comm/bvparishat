Dear Ajitji



No, there is a vritti by name, Brahmamritavarshini published by Chowkhamba Sanskrit Series (<http://www.chowkhambasanskritseries.com/books.php?id=1265354159>) The blurb describes the work as a commentary, but the actual work is more like a vritti, and in fact referred to as a vritti by scholars if I am not mistaken.



Regards

N. Siva Senani
