Dear Siva Senani,  
  
By Chowkambha edition do you mean Brahma SutraBhasya with commentaries Bhamati, Kalpataru and Kalpataru Parimala which is reprint of Nirnaya Sagr Edition. It doesnot have any Vritti. I think Lalitaji didnot ask for all commentaries on Brahma Sutra Bhashya. Please correct me if I am wrong.  
Regards
