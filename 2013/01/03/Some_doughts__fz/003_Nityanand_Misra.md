Actually, he has both doubts and thoughts. "Dought" is a [portmanteau](http://oald8.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/dictionary/portmanteau-word) of "doubt" and "thought". I had some *doughts* myself about this word but now I am convinced.  
  
Do not be surprised if we see this word in dictionaries in future. Remember, Sarah Palin once used *refudiate* on Twitter in 2010. The Twitteratti parsed it as refute + repudiate, had a good laugh @ Palin's expense, but to their chagrin it went on to become Oxford American Dictionary's 2010 Word of the Year.  
  
We linguists should never have *doughts* regarding *doughttful* words.  
  
PS: I am just joking, but I am not joking about Sarah Palin - that actually happened :) - <http://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/2010/11/noad-2010-word-of-the-year/>
