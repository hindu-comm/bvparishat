There is also the famous 'AchAryavAn purSho veda' of the Chandogya Upanishad 6th chapter.  
  
श्रुतं ह्येव मे भगवद्दृशेभ्य *आचार्याध्दैव विद्या विदिता साधिष्ठं प्राप*तीति तस्मै हैतदेवोवाचात्र ह न किञ्चन वीयायेति
(Brihadaranyakopanishad ...)  
  
  
prashnopanishad 6th chapter:  
  
तमभ्यर्चयन्तः-

त्वं हि नः पिता योऽस्माकमविद्यायाः परं पारं तारयसि – इति

नमः परमऋषिभ्यो नमः परमऋषिभ्यः

To them he (again) said: - Only thus far do I know of this supreme Brahman. There is nothing higher than this. They worshipped him ( and said): Thou, indeed, art our father who dost take us across to the other shore of nescience.

Salutation to the supreme Rishis. Salutations to the Supreme Rishis!  
  
There is another expression from the Upanishad which says: the debt of the disciple who has been taught by the Acharya is not repaid even if he were to pay in the form of gold heaped to the height of an elephant.  
  
I do not remember where this occurs.  
  
Again, in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad Janaka says: even if the entire kingdom is placed at the feet of the Acharya (Yajnavalkya) it would not be suffice for the teaching obtained from him.

५ स तद्यदेतद्धर्मशास्त्रं नापुत्राय नाशिष्याय नासंवत्सरोषिताय दद्यात्
from the dharma sutra (not upanishad but the message is sublime).
