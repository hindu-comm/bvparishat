Thanks! But there are many such pieces which it was not felt necessary to refer to. The Ṛk-Prātiśākhya, for example, treats the whole subject of āmnāya learning from the Ācārya. Dārila, introductory part in the commentary upon the Kauśika-Sūtra, is more detailed about the different types of texts to be adopted for teaching and learning the Vedas. The second chapter of the Manu-Samhitā is another instance of detailed treatment.  
The human elements get focus in the Uddālaka story. That and the story of Jābāli and Gautama are popular in Bengal. Tagore had a poem on the latter.

PS. There may be typos in my letters. I could never adjust myself to the computer keyboard when leaving the dear old type-writer. I ask for forgiveness.
