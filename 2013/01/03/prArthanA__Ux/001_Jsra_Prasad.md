अयि भोः प्रणामाः ।  
श्रीमता कृष्णमूर्तिमहोदयेन उत्तमं समाधानं दत्तम् । तच्च महते उपयोगाय भवति ।  
अन्यच्च मद्रपुर्यां इतः द्विदशाब्दिपूर्वं पी.पी.एस्.टी. (Patriotic&People oriented Science and Technology) संस्थया अपूर्वाः गोष्ठ्यः, समावेशाश्च नैकवारमायोजिताः । तद्विषयकं ज्ञानमस्मात् प्राप्यते - <http://ppstbulletins.blogspot.com>. तत्रैव कृषि-वृक्षायुर्वेदविषयकसन्दर्भसीच्यपि प्रदत्ता - <http://ppstbulletins.blogspot.com/2011/10/bibliography-on-indian-agriculture-and.html>. अन्तर्जाले उपलभ्यमानेषु स्रोतस्सु इदमत्युत्तमं भवति ।  
  
पुनश्च 'खाद्यशृङ्खला, वायुशृङ्खला विषये कुत्रापि उक्तं वा..' इत्यस्य प्रश्नस्य भावः न ज्ञातः ।  
  
आञ्जनेयप्रसादः
