Dear Sirs,

I need not state the most basic rule that any verse should be in a  
regular metrical pattern. Therefore in the respectable authors are  
requested to follow that basic condition before further corrections at  
the level of grammar or stylistics. Those who are desirous of knowing  
the basics of Sanskrit prosody, can visit the website [padyapaana.com](http://padyapaana.com)  
which has video lessons on both Sanskrit and Kannada prosody. The  
former lessons are in English medium while the latter are in Kannada  
it self.

regards

ganesh
