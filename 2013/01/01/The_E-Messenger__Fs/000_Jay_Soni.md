To Readers and Lovers of Sanskrit,

  

It is a great pleasure to release the next issue of Viduu, Vidyud-duutah, the E-Messnger with a special stanza on the occasion of this the first day of the New Year. It is hoped, again, that you will enjoy it in your tight schedule during a short break.

  

With best wishes,

  

Jay Soni
