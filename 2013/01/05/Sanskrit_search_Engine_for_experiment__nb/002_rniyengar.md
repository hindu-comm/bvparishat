Dear Dr. Varakhedi,  
  
The search engine is really very useful I tried for the word "alaata" and it put out 24 results with text in Devanagari. It is the old SE, not the new, which worked for me. This is a very useful tool for quickly investigating word correlations.  
  
Two minor observations:  
  
1.The spelling of the word "Occurrence" may be corrected.  
2.The link to the cited texts did not open in all the cases, when I checked with another word "IriNam"  
  
Great effort. Congratulations to the Team behind the SE!  
  
Regards  
  
RN Iyengar
