Dear Scholars,

Nice to hear from Prof. Achar. He has clarified that for AVP he has depended on the Hindi notes and interpretations of Rai. The original AVP edition of Bolling and Negelen (1909) and e-text by Ishii of Tokai Univ. Japan (title page attached) does not have any subdivisions in the contents of the individual chapters, which are each titled. I have access to the above and I do not follow Hindi translations for any Sanskrit text.All the same I stand by what I have written.

  

I don't like to comment on the non-scholarly out-of-context remarks of the above member about my professionalposition at the Jain Universitydragging in the name of Witzel (& Whitney) who is not a member of this group.

  

Regards

RN Iyengar
