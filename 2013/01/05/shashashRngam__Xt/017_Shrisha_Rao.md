Some renowned Advaitins of yore did refer to them as from the माण्डूक्य, such as  
  
मायामात्रमिदं द्वैतमद्वैतं परमार्थतः ।  
इति माण्डूक्यशाखायां श्रुतिवाक्यमुदाहृतम् ॥  
  
by Sāyaṇa (compare with विवेकचूडामणि ४०६), माण्डूक्यशाखायामपि श्रूयते in the जीवन्मुक्तिविवेक (also see the commentary by Acyutarāya Modaka), and इति माण्डूक्योपनिषदि by Appayya in the कल्पतरु-परिमळ (under S.BSB II-1-33). In fact I am not aware of any Advaitic reference earlier than the 17th century that unambiguously ascribes the आगम-प्रकरण verses to Gauḍapāda. However, modern Indologists (following some recent Advaitins) misunderstand the historical record, and hold that proper tradition is to ascribe the verses to Gauḍapāda and a modern incorrect view is to take them as श्रुति. Thus, Paul Hacker and others also differentiate between the fake Śankara of the VSN-भाष्य and the विवेकचूडामणि who considers the verses to be श्रुति, and the real one of the कारिका commentary and other works who (apparently) does not. Similarly, T.M.P. Mahadevan says that there were "probably" two Ānandagiris, distinguished in the same way. If this line of reasoning is right and Appaya is accepted, then Śankara's BSB must actually have been a collaboration between the real and the fake Śankaras, because both views can be supported therein!  

  
\> Within the dvaita tradition, however, it seems as if the entire AgamaprakaraNa chapter, inclusive of prose and verse, is considered Sruti. I'm not sure what the stances of other vedAnta schools are, if at all they have a specific one on this.  
  

There is a difference of opinion in the विशिष्टाद्वैत tradition: the 12th-cent. Kūranārāyaṇa considers the verses to be part of the Upanishad (following Rāmānuja's use of श्रूयते in respect of अनादिमायया सुप्तो यदा जीवः प्रबुद्ध्यते), but the 17th-cent. Rangarāmānuja does not.
