There is hardly any need to say 'the Acharya is bringing forward' in this context (तात्पर्याधीनत्वात् शब्दवृत्तेः), even if by any stretch of imagination प्रणीतं could mean that. If the prose portions and the verse portions are equally shruti, there is no need for the commentator to say only for the verse portions that are already existing as shruti to be 'brought forward' since they are all available here only in one text form. Nor did Gaudapada or Shankara 'bring forward' those shloka-s. It could be said about the 'bringing out / manifesting' the shruti at the time of creation since it remained in avyaktAvasthA.  If these shlokas are hidden or available in some other work or at a distance then there is scope to say 'brought forward or brought out'. The verses themselves are श्रुत्यर्थप्रकाशिकाः By saying this the author is already differentiating them from the shruti. Anyway, the evidence is out there and people are welcome to conclude as they wish; यस्य नास्ति स्वयं प्रज्ञा, etc.

But I would consider the अनुभूतिस्वरूपाचार्यः(rather than Sureshwara) to be unambiguous as this occurs in this AgamaprakaraNam itself where the word 'shlokAH' is used in the text itself (as retained in the Madhwa reading too). For that matter even Chitsukhacharya, an equally prAchIna Acharya has said in his 'भाष्यभावप्रकाशिका’ with reference to the shAnkaran quote in the BSB the kArikA verse 'मृल्लोहविस्फुलिङ्गाद्यैः..’ which I cited earlier, ’ इति गौडपादवचनात्’.   
  
Moreover there is no determined standard for what can be 'unambiguous'.
For धात्वर्थानामनेकत्वात्,शब्दानामनेकार्थवत्त्वात् . Is it not precisely because of this there have been so many schools that have the 'same' Veda, sutra and Gita as the fundamental source-texts? What is 'unambiguously' the purport of the Veda for one is not so but something else alone is for some other one. And a word that is unambiguous for one can still be ambiguous to another. There can never be an agreement between two persons on an issue.

I think such a view will take one nowhere. Over a hundred years ago Sri Narasimha Bharati SwaminaH of Sringeri undertook a project of collecting a number of texts, manuscripts, etc. and examined them and commissioned the Vani Vilas press at Srirangam to print Shankara's works. The Bhashyam/kArikA for the Mandukya too is a part of this. Since this is not in tune with the other commentators' reading of the mandukya shruti, can one say that this Acharya did not receive or understand the correct Vedic/Shankaran tradition? In fact such a question will arise even with respect to the prasthAnatraya source texts since the Acharya-s of the major schools do have different readings of these texts themselves.
Whose tradition can be admitted to be the pure/true/real/authentic one as against the others'?
