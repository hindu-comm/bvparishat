There is confusion in the sense the difference between alIka vastu and sadasadvilakshaNa vastu is not easily grasped. While alIka is never an object of cognition in a substratum, a sadasadvliakshaNa vastu is  
at some point. A reading of polemic texts will make this clear. Please see <http://www.advaitasiddhi.org/part11> for a formal description.
