\> • In the BSB (Brahmasutra bhashya) for 2.1.3.9 Shankara makes this observation:  

\> मायामात्रं ह्येतद्यत्परमात्मनोऽवस्थात्रयात्मनावभासनं रज्ज्वा इव सर्पादिभावेनेति । अत्रोक्तं वेदान्तार्थसंप्रदायविद्भिराचार्यैः 'अनादिमायया सुप्तो यदा जीवः प्रबुध्यते ।  
\>  
\> अजमनिद्रमस्वप्नमद्वैतं बुध्यते तदाऽ (गौडपा. कारि. १.१६) इति ।'  
  

B.N.K. Sharma suggests in one of his papers that the above can be parsed as मायामात्रं ह्येतद्यत्परमात्मनोऽवस्थात्रयात्मनावभासनं रज्ज्वा इव सर्पादिभावेनेत्यत्रोक्तं वेदान्तार्थसंप्रदायविद्भिराचार्यैः । "अनादिमायया सुप्तो यदा जीवः प्रबुध्यते । अजमनिद्रमस्वप्नमद्वैतं बुध्यते तदा" इति... The reference then is implicitly to another, later कारिका verse which unambiguously mentions the रज्जु-सर्प analogy, rather than to this आगम-प्रकरण verse which says nothing about it.  
  
From what I have seen, there is nothing in the commentaries that rules out such a split.  

  
\> And at the beginning of each prakaraNa Shankara again states the purpose, by even naming the prakaraNam as they are popularly known.  
  

However, it is worth noting that only of the first chapter does Śankara say आगममात्रं तत् -- though some texts now feature an unwarranted and puzzling interpolation (not noticed by Ānandagiri) right before this remark at the beginning of the second प्रकरण.  

  
\> As to the other cited Advaita Acharyas of the later centuries taking some verses of the Agama prakaraNam as shruti, some other explanation is required. One such given by a scholar is: After Madhwacharya the AgmaprakaraNam came to be popular as shruti entirely. This 'prachAra' was adopted by these Advaita Acharyas too when they cited passages from there. But the Advaita tradition of teachers and teaching has not taken into cognizance these stray incidents. They have stuck to the tradition of considering the AgamaprakaraNam as consisting of part shruti and part kArikA-s.  
  

Such explanation does little justice to the facts: it suggests that stalwarts such as Sāyaṇa and Vidyāraṇya were misled easily and/or went with the fashion of an adversarial proponent, and even reduces Appayya, a known bitter critic of Madhva, to his follower! Most of all, it ignores the reality of Śankara, Rāmānuja, Kūranārāyaṇa, etc., citing the verses as श्रुति well before Madhva.
