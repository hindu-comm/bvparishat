Even this suggestion does not by default take away the intended meaning of the bhAShyam. 'इत्यत्र' is taken as अधिकरणसप्तमी by Sharma. But nothing prevents one from taking the same इत्यत्र to mean विषयसम्प्तमी to give the comfortable reading: ....इत्यस्मिन्विषये / इत्यस्मिन्नर्थे उक्तं वेदान्तार्थसंप्रदायविद्भिराचार्यैः ...  

  
Moreover, when a verse that is readily available/identifiable here as from the Gaudapada kArikA to which Shankara Himself has commented, it is unreasonable to think of a supposed verse which is only in the wilderness. दृष्टे संभवति सति अदृष्टकल्पनमन्याय्यम् ।

I do not quite understand what you mean here. Is it the sentence '’ज्ञाते द्वैतं न विद्यते’ इत्युक्तम् । *’एकमेवाद्वितीयम्’ इत्यादिश्रुतिभ्यः* । \[आगममात्रम् तत् \] I find this (red) highlighted sentence in the Ashtekar, Poona, 1918 publication edited by Hari Raghunath Bhagavat B.A. It is in the Anandashram edition too and in the Gorakhpur (Gita press) edition as well.

Is it not too well known that Appayya, in the introduction to his चतुर्मतसारसङ्ग्रहः (a work on the template of the Brahmasutras) writes this verse:  
*  
आनन्दतीर्थमुनि*लक्ष्मणदेशिकेन्द्रश्रीकण्ठयोगिपदवीरदवीयसीर्नः ।  

आचार्यपादसरणिञ्च विविच्य बोद्धुं संगृह्यते मतचतुष्टयसारलेशम् ॥  
  
He refers to Madhva, Ramanuja and SrikanTha with respectful suffixes.
His work*, in tune* with Madhva siddhAnta, is called here न्यायमुक्तावली - he writes:  
  
आदावानन्दतीर्थीयामनुसृत्य मतस्थितिं  
न्यायमुक्तावली रम्या विशदार्था विरच्यते ॥  
While commencing the नयमयूखमालिका in keeping with Ramanuja's system, he writes:  
...*लक्ष्मणार्य*हृदयानुसारिणी लिख्यते नयमयूखमालिका (लक्ष्मणः = रामानुजः)  
  

  
But the facts are sometimes bitter too. I am not very competent to talk about this particular instance: It seems Appayya talks (favourably) about a 'saMkarSha-kANDa' going by the name of 'devatA kANDam' which was indeed fashioned out by the vishiShTAdvaitins but it has turned out to be a non-fact. It is pointed out that even Madhusudana Saraswati, in the commentary to the verse 'त्रयी सांख्यं योगः...’ of the शिवमहिम्नस्तोत्रम् makes a mention of this without giving any detail. Also, it is well known that many Advaita Acharyas give their own interpretations, not always in tune with that of Shankara, to the shruti/gita passages.

Where does Shankara cite the AgamaprakaraNa kArikA verses as shruti?  
  
Also, could you pl. provide me the full reference/sentence of // माण्डूक्यशाखायामपि श्रूयते in the जीवन्मुक्तिविवेक (also see the commentary by Acyutarāya Modaka),// that you mentioned in an earlier post? In the JMV edition that I have (Adayar Library) there is a fine list of quotations in this book with references and page number in this edition. It lists some six verses of the Gaudapada kArikA, two of them from the Agama prakaraNa. But in all those places Vidyaranya has said 'Gaudapadacharya says..'. Pl. also give what Modak says since I do not have that copy with me.
