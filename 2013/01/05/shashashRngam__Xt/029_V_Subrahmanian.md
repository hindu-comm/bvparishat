If the numbering shown above (आ. प्र. १३-१५) is considered, then this tallies with the GaudapAda*kArikA* in the Agama prakaraNa numbering.
These three verses are the kArikAs bearing those numbers 13, 14 and 15.
It is NOT the AgamaprakaraNa mantra numbering. If these are intended to be shown as the Upanishad mantras then they have to bear a numbering of a much higher value. That is the reason I think the editors in 1978 corrected the text by removing the 'माण्डूक्यशाखायामपि श्रूयते' and showed these verses as तदुक्तं गौडपादाचार्यैः to be in tune with the Advaita Bhashya books published and available which is what a reader of JMV, who is most likely an Advaitin, will turn to for further consultations/verifications. What I mean to say / point out is: the so-called 1930 edition is itself not free from errors and therefore cannot be held sacrosanct. The puzzlement is only because the number 13 - 15 is pertaining to the kArika counting and NOT the upanishad mantra counting. If they had wanted to retain the 'माण्डूक्यशाखायामपि श्रूयते' in the new edition, they would have had to give a numbering to these 'mantras' as responsible editors. Where can they get the numbering checked, with which source and determine the exact mantra-numbering for these verses and incorporate them in the 1978 edition? Here, is for example, one such source which has considered the entire Agama prakarana as shruti: the Madhwa bhashya:  
  
<http://www.dvaita.net/pdf/shruti/manduka/mbtcomm.pdf>  
  
But then the problem, if this is consulted (which is very unlikely for an Advaitin), would be that there are four 'khanDas' (sections) and the numbering is 1.2....2.2 etc... Where will the editors be able to fit the said verses as shruti mantras? And how is it to be known for sure that such khaNDa classification is authentic? Have all those who treat the entire aa.pra. as shruti have this same numbering system in their readings? Where is such a source to be found which can be taken as reliable? If it is said that the 1930 edition made a mistake regarding mentioning (आ. प्र. १३-१५) as the number, then one can well argue that the presence of 'माण्डूक्यशाखायामपि श्रूयते --' is also a mistake committed by some manual copier/editor/proof reader at some stage which cannot be ruled out.

Modak has only commented based on the reading he has on hand.
