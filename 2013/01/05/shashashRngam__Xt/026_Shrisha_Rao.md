\> Moreover, when a verse that is readily available/identifiable here as from the Gaudapada kArikA to which Shankara Himself has commented, it is unreasonable to think of a supposed verse which is only in the wilderness. दृष्टे संभवति सति अदृष्टकल्पनमन्याय्यम् ।  
  

Except that अनादिमायया सुप्तो says nothing about the rope-snake analogy which is what Śankara is explicitly attributing to the earlier source in this instance. It is quite proper to think that Śankara here is drawing attention to that as well as to the अनादिमायया सुप्तो verse. This type of implicit citation is seen in many other instances, e.g., with the usages आप्तकामश्रुतेः, सृष्टिश्रुतः, सर्वज्ञश्रुतेश्च (all under II-1-33).  

  
\> \> And at the beginning of each prakaraNa Shankara again states the purpose, by even naming the prakaraNam as they are popularly known.

\> However, it is worth noting that only of the first chapter does Śankara say आगममात्रं तत् -- though some texts now feature an unwarranted and puzzling interpolation (not noticed by Ānandagiri) right before this remark at the beginning of the second प्रकरण.  
\>  
\> I do not quite understand what you mean here. Is it the sentence '’ज्ञाते द्वैतं न विद्यते’ इत्युक्तम् । ’एकमेवाद्वितीयम्’ इत्यादिश्रुतिभ्यः । \[आगममात्रम् तत् \] I find this (red) highlighted sentence in the Ashtekar, Poona, 1918 publication edited by Hari Raghunath Bhagavat B.A. It is in the Anandashram edition too and in the Gorakhpur (Gita press) edition as well.  
  

The commentators do not seem to find it in their texts because they have said nothing about it.  

  
\> Is it not too well known that Appayya, in the introduction to his चतुर्मतसारसङ्ग्रहः (a work on the template of the Brahmasutras) writes this verse:  
\>  
\> आनन्दतीर्थमुनिलक्ष्मणदेशिकेन्द्रश्रीकण्ठयोगिपदवीरदवीयसीर्नः ।  
\> आचार्यपादसरणिञ्च विविच्य बोद्धुं संगृह्यते मतचतुष्टयसारलेशम् ॥  
\>  
\> He refers to Madhva, Ramanuja and SrikanTha with respectful suffixes. His work, in tune with Madhva siddhAnta, is called here न्यायमुक्तावली - he writes:  
\>  
\> आदावानन्दतीर्थीयामनुसृत्य मतस्थितिं  
\> न्यायमुक्तावली रम्या विशदार्था विरच्यते ॥  
\> While commencing the नयमयूखमालिका in keeping with Ramanuja's system, he writes:  
\> ...लक्ष्मणार्यहृदयानुसारिणी लिख्यते नयमयूखमालिका (लक्ष्मणः = रामानुजः)  
\>  
\>  
\> But the facts are sometimes bitter too. I am not very competent to talk about this particular instance: It seems Appayya talks (favourably) about a 'saMkarSha-kANDa' going by the name of 'devatA kANDam' which was indeed fashioned out by the vishiShTAdvaitins but it has turned out to be a non-fact.  
  

So Appayya is a foolish ignoramus after all. I'm sold, but good luck convincing everyone else!  

  
\> Where does Shankara cite the AgamaprakaraNa kArikA verses as shruti?  
  

I have already mentioned the विवेकचूडामणि in this regard.  

  
\> Also, could you pl. provide me the full reference/sentence of // माण्डूक्यशाखायामपि श्रूयते in the जीवन्मुक्तिविवेक (also see the commentary by Acyutarāya Modaka),// that you mentioned in an earlier post? In the JMV edition that I have (Adayar Library) there is a fine list of quotations in this book with references and page number in this edition. It lists some six verses of the Gaudapada kArikA, two of them from the Agama prakaraNa. But in all those places Vidyaranya has said 'Gaudapadacharya says..'. Pl. also give what Modak says since I do not have that copy with me.  
  

The exact sequence is:  
  
तदुक्तं गौडपादाचार्यैः --  
  
"निगृहीतस्य मनसो निर्विकल्पस्य धीमतः \|  
प्रचारः स तु विज्ञेयः सुषुप्त्यन्यो न चेतसः ॥  
  
लीयते हि सुषुप्तौ तन्निगृहीतं न लीयते \|  
तदेव निर्भयं ब्रह्म ज्ञानालोकं समन्ततः ॥"  
  
(अद्वैत प्रकरण ३४-३५) इति \|  
  
माण्डूक्यशाखायामपि श्रूयते --  
  
"द्वैतस्याग्रहणं तुल्यमुभयोः प्राज्ञतुर्ययोः \|  
बीजनिद्रायुतः प्राज्ञः सा च तुर्ये न विद्यते ॥  
  
स्वप्ननिद्रायुतावाद्यौ प्राज्ञस्त्वस्वप्ननिद्रया \|  
न निद्रां नैव च स्वप्नं तुर्ये पश्यन्ति निश्चिताः ॥  
  
अन्यथा गृह्णतः स्वप्नो निद्रा तत्त्वमजानतः \|  
विपर्यासे तयोः क्षीणे तुरीयं पदमश्नुते ॥" (आ. प्र. १३-१५)  
इति \|\|  
  
The 1930s Adyar Library edition of the JMV preserves this text correctly (with the editors helpfully supplying a footnote indicating their puzzlement), and I have seen the same in other printed editions. The 1978 Adyar Library edition however attempts to destroy the evidence, with their altered text reading:  
  
तदुक्तं गौडपादाचार्यैः --  
  
"निगृहीतस्य ..." इति \|  
  
"द्वैतस्याग्रहणं ..." इति च \|  
  
The phrase माण्डूक्यशाखायामपि श्रूयते is removed, and the second इति is changed to इति च.  
  
The commentator Acyutarāya Modaka says उदाहृतमाण्डूक्यशाखीयश्लोकौ साम्प्रदायिकरीत्या विशदयति आद्यावित्यादिना in this regard, giving the lie to the alteration.
