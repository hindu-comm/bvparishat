Effective communication tip 1: Please qualify your terse statements. Who is confused? Where is the confusion? According to whom this confusion exists?

Effective communication tip 2: If you use ITRANS, please use a Serif font which formats lowercase " L" different from the uppercase " I ". With a non-serif font, the reader cannot distinguish between allka =अल्ल्क, aIIka=अईईक, alIka=अलीक, aIlka=अईल्क. Or please use Devanagari or IAST to be clear.

Refer effective communication tip 1.

Refer effective communication tip 1. Which polemic text(s) - अद्वैतसिद्धिः or शतदूषणी or सत्यार्थप्रकाश? Sorry I cannot read your mind and your posts are too terse to follow.

1. Hardly a reliable source.  
2. I would have read the math had the formatting not put me off - call me old school but I prefer PS/PDF produced by LaTeX.  
3. The is at best "sectarian math" based on sectarian assumptions. I don't need to remind you that frequentist statistics and Bayesian statistics both have formal descriptions and yet both schools differ so much from each other owing to their assumptions.  
  
Thanks, Nityanand
