Dear Sri Vidyasankar,  
  
I wish to point out that Sri Appayya Dikshitar, Sri Vidyaranya and Sri Madhusudana Saraswati have referred to certain (not all) of the verses contained in the Agama prakaraNam to be 'shruti' in their works.  
  
\[I have not inquired this aspect: whether these three Advaita Acharyas have anywhere stated that these passages are from the '**mAnDUkya** shruti'. It is again possible that those verses are indeed part of some other Upanishad that might be called 'minor' ones.\]  
  
At the beginning of the first kArikA starting 'bahiShprajno vibhurvishvo...' we find the words '*atraite shlokaa bhavanti'* and the bhashyam words 'अत्रैतस्मिन्योक्तेऽर्थे एते श्लोका भवन्ति’. For these words Anandagiri writes: आचार्यैर्माण्डूक्योपनिषदं पठित्वा तद्व्याख्यानश्लोकावतारण*मत्रेत्यादिना कृतं* तदत्रेत्यनूद्य भाष्यकारो व्याकरोति - एतस्मिन्नित्ति ।  
  
From the above I think Anandagiri says: Shankaracharya, after having studied the Mandukyopanishad from His Acharyas, seeing that the vyAkhyAna shlokas (for the Upanishad) are being introduced by the words 'atra etc.', (in the text that Shankaracharya used for His study) refers to that by repeating the word '*अत्र* = एतस्मिन्यथोक्तेऽर्थे *एते श्लोका भवन्ति*.
