\> If the numbering shown above (आ. प्र. १३-१५) is considered, then this tallies with the GaudapAdakArikA in the Agama prakaraNa numbering. These three verses are the kArikAs bearing those numbers 13, 14 and 15. It is NOT the AgamaprakaraNa mantra numbering. If these are intended to be shown as the Upanishad mantras then they have to bear a numbering of a much higher value. That is the reason I think the editors in 1978 corrected the text by removing the 'माण्डूक्यशाखायामपि श्रूयते' and showed these verses as तदुक्तं गौडपादाचार्यैः to be in tune with the  
  

I'm sorry, but that has to be the most fatuous reasoning I have yet seen on this issue. The numbering is always a later feature that Vedantic authors (e.g., Vidyāraṇya) themselves do not bother with (classical manuscripts do not have such numbers, but recent printed editions frequently do). In this case I added them myself to show where the verses were in the current Advaitic rendering. One does not mutilate text for such specious reasons. Anyway, the evidence is out there and people are welcome to conclude as they wish; यस्य नास्ति स्वयं प्रज्ञा, etc.
