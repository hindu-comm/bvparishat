Thank you for presenting the above valuable references. Some time ago I had occasion to prepare a paper on 'references to GaudapAda's kArikA-s in the shAnkara bhAShya-s (other than the kArikA/mAnDUkya bhAShyam)' which may be seen here:  
[http://groups.yahoo.com/group/advaitin/files/Gaudapada%27s_Signature_in_Shankara\\  
\_Bhashya.pdf](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/advaitin/files/Gaudapada%27s_Signature_in_Shankara_Bhashya.pdf)  
  
I am paraphrasing a few portions from there:  
  

1.  In the BSB (Brahmasutra bhashya) for 2.1.3.9 Shankara makes this
    observation:

    मायामात्रं ह्येतद्यत्परमात्मनोऽवस्थात्रयात्मनावभासनं रज्ज्वा इव
    सर्पादिभावेनेति । अत्रोक्तं वेदान्तार्थसंप्रदायविद्भिराचार्यैः
    'अनादिमायया सुप्तो यदा जीवः प्रबुध्यते ।

    अजमनिद्रमस्वप्नमद्वैतं बुध्यते तदाऽ (गौडपा. कारि. १.१६) इति ।'

2.  In the BSB 1.4.4.14 Shankara concludes by citing this kArikA, among
    several other shruti passages:   

    मृदादिदृष्टान्तैश्च कार्यस्य कारणेनाभेदं वदितुं सृष्ट्यादिप्रपञ्चः
    श्राव्यत इति गम्यते ।

    तथाच संप्रदायविदो वदन्ति मृल्लोहविस्फुलिङ्गाद्यैः सृष्टिर्या
    चोदितान्यथा ।

    उपायः सोऽवताराय नास्ति भेदः कथञ्चन । ।’

    (माण्डू. का. ३.१५) इति ।

3.  It can be noticed that the first cited kArikA is from the Agama
    prakaraNa. If it is a shruti vAkyam then the reference to the author
    of the cited passage as 'अत्रोक्तं
    वेदान्तार्थसंप्रदायविद्भिराचार्यैः' would not be in place as the
    Agama prakaraNa is not in the manner of a dialogue between an
    Acharya and a disciple even if it can be admitted, for argument's
    sake, to be a shruti passage. Thus this reference is clearly to
    GaudapAda, the author of the kArika-s of the AgamaprakaraNa.  

4.  In the second cited verse too, the reference to the author is made
    in a similar way as in the first: संप्रदायविदो वदन्ति ..

Shankara begins the Mandukya upanishad bhashya with this opening sentence: ओमित्येतदक्षरमिदं सर्वं तस्योपव्याख्यानम् । वेदान्तार्थसारसंग्रहभूतमिदं *प्रकरणचतुष्टयम् ओमित्येतदक्षरमित्याद्यारभ्यते* । and further summarizes what these four prakaraNam-s are meant for: तत्र तावदोंकारनिर्णयाय *प्रथमं प्रकरणं आगमप्रधानम्* आत्मतत्त्वप्रतिपत्त्युपायभूतम् । यस्य द्वैतप्रपञ्चस्योपशमेऽद्वैतप्रतिपत्ती रज्ज्वां इव सर्पादिविकल्प उपशमे रज्जुतत्त्वप्रतिपत्तिस्तस्य द्वैतस्य हेतुतो वैतथ्यप्रतिपादनाय द्वितीयं प्रकरणम् । तथाद्वैतस्यापि वैतथ्यप्रसङ्गप्राप्तौ युक्तितस्तथात्वदर्शनाय तृतीयं प्रकरणम् । अद्वैतस्य तथात्वप्रतिपत्तिपक्षभूतानि यानि वादान्तराण्यवैदिकानि तेषम् अन्योन्यविरोधित्वादतथार्थत्वेन तदुपपत्तिभिरेव निराकरणाय चतुर्थं प्रकरणम् ।  
<http://vedantavichara.weebly.com/23102327235023462381235223252352233923502381.html>  
  
And at the beginning of each prakaraNa Shankara again states the purpose, by even naming the prakaraNam as they are popularly known. I do not think the other Acharyas Ramanuja and Madhwa have seen this text as a four-chaptered one as Shankara does even at the very beginning of the first chapter: प्रकरणचतुष्टयम् ओमित्येतदक्षरमित्याद्यारभ्यते. It appears to me that Shankara is seeing the first Chapter, Agama prakaraNam as consisting of the shruti and the kArikas, going by the BSB reference to 'sampradaya vits' while mentioning the kArika, of even the first chapter.** Thus there is no inconsistency as far as Shankara's bhashya-s are concerned. Shankara's opening words even give the impression that the four-chaptered text is not shruti at all but one based on the shruti-paramatAtparyam वेदान्तार्थसारसंग्रहभूतमिदं ... But tradition has held that the AgamaprakaraNam consists of the Upanishad and the explanatory kArika-s.  
  
As to the other cited Advaita Acharyas of the later centuries taking some verses of the Agama prakaraNam as shruti, some other explanation is required. One such given by a scholar is: After Madhwacharya the AgmaprakaraNam came to be popular as shruti entirely. This 'prachAra' was adopted by these Advaita Acharyas too when they cited passages from there. But the Advaita tradition of teachers and teaching has not taken into cognizance these stray incidents. They have stuck to the tradition of considering the AgamaprakaraNam as consisting of part shruti and part kArikA-s.
