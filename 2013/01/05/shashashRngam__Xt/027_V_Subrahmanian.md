Sir,  
  
श्रीमदनुभूतिस्वरूपाचार्याः (12th Century, post bhAmatI and earlier to the Kalpataru of Amalananda) the famed author of the work प्रकटार्थविवरणम् (and a number of works on Advaita) has authored a commentary on the माण्डूक्योपनिषद्भाष्यम् as well. At the beginning of this wok he says in the mangala shloka -  
  
गौडपादीयभाष्यस्य टिप्पणं क्रियते स्फुटम् ।  
चितोज्झितागमाख्यातृचित्तसन्तापशान्तये ॥ २ ॥  
  
After a fairly elaborate commentary on the bhAShyam and the shruti and verses too in some cases, he remarks at the beginning of his gloss at the point where the mAnDUkya upanishat mantra ends (12th mantra) once for all and the remaining verses of the kArikA-s of the Agama prakaraNam commence (24, etc.) thus:  
  
\[There is a line अत्रैते श्लोका भवन्ति (as it appeared even when the first set of shlokas occurred at the end of the sixth mantra एष सर्वेश्वर... ) At that juncture Shankara's commentary to that line was: अत्रैतस्मिन्यथोक्तेऽर्थे एते श्लोका भवन्ति ।. Here too, at the commencement of the 24th kArikA this अत्रैते श्लोका भवन्ति line occurs in the text and Shankara says: just पूर्ववत् (अत्रैते श्लोका भवन्ति). \]
 anubhUtisvarUpAchArya says here:  
  
पूर्ववदिति । यथा पूर्वश्रुत्यर्थप्रकाशिकाः श्लोका आचार्येण प्रणीतास्तथोत्तरेऽपि श्लोका इत्यर्थः ।  
  
//Just as the earlier verses (of the kArikA) that elucidated the purport of the earlier shruti passages were composed by the AchArya (GaudapAda), so too the latter verses too (that elucidate the other remaining shruti passages) (are composed by GaudapAda). That is the purport of Shankara's word ' पूर्ववत्'.//  
  
In the above commentary this 12th century Acharya has stated beyond doubt that the entire verse-portion of the Agama prakaraNam is the composition of GaudapAda.  
  
This commentary is printed along with the Anandagiri's in the publication of Mahesh Research Institute, Varanasi. The volume is one containing eight upanishad commentaries with sub commentaries and edited by Dr.Mani Dravid SastriNaH.
