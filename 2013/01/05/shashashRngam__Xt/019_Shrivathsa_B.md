hariH OM,  
  

 I request the moderators to take note of the mail of Mr. Mishra which is trying to browbeat Mr. Hudli. Mr. Mishra has been doing this for quite some time now.  
  

 I don't know what place "effective communication tip"s have in a post of scholarly exchange. If he were really concerned about the communication of Mr. Hudli, he would have written a personal mail to him rather than insult him in this way on the forum. Or used it as a quibble to divert attention from the issue at hand.  
  

 If Mr. Mishra is very concerned about effective communication of others, may he also take note of the communication bloopers which he himself commits by way of typos such as the one below:

  
"The is at best "sectarian math" based on sectarian assumptions."  

 Has Mr. Mishra forgotten that the first effective communication tip is not to have typos in one's mails?  
  

 It doesn't take an Einstein to know that we are all humans (i don't know about Mr. Mishra) and prone to errors and let us not play this holier than thou thing.  
  

svasti,  

 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,
