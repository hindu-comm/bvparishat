It may be the case. It is not the natural fire. But the example is the burning wood अलात swung swiftly so that it forms a circle of fire, which is the basis of the illusion of अलातचक्र in the examples cited by Prof. Korada. "अलातमुल्मुकम्" is explained as दग्धकाष्ठ or just burning charcoal according to some commentaries on Amara along with अङ्गार. उल्मुक is different from उल्कापात falling of meteors and अलात is not used in the sense. अलातशान्ति in the context, means just like the illusion of the circle of fire stops when the swinging is stopped, the realization of truth Brahman naturally stops all the illusions created by the avidya.

  

This just is my idea of the name of the topic अलातशान्ति प्रकरण. Vedantins will supply more information from the commentaries and sub commentaries for justifying the naming. And this is different from the Ulkapatashanti. Or in the broadest sense, both might have been used synonyms.
