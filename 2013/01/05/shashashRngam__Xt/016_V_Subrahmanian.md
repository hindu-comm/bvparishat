I have uploaded a few pages from the book 'jIvanmuktabhArati' published by the Sringeri Sharada Peetham in 2005. It has an English translation too, with explanatory notes, in the same book. The English portion covering the five khyAtivAda-s (Theories of 'Error' according to the various schools of Indian Philosophy) is in the scanned pages and members who are interested may read the same by using this URL:
