Sir,  
  
The above is the way the example is taken in the ShankarabhAShya for those kArikA-s that specify this example. For the kArikA ऋजुवक्त्रादिकाभासमलातस्पन्दितं यथा । ग्रहणाग्रहणकाभासं विज्ञानस्पन्दितं तथा ॥ ४.४६ ॥ the Bhashyam says:  
  
यथोक्तं परमार्थदर्शनं पपञ्चयिष्यन्नाह - यथा हि लोक ऋजुवक्रादिप्रकाराभास*मलातस्पन्दितमुल्काचलनं* तथा ग्रहणग्राहकाभासं विषयिविषयाभासमित्यर्थः ।
