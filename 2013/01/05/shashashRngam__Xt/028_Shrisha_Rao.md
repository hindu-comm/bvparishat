\> श्रीमदनुभूतिस्वरूपाचार्याः (12th Century, post bhAmatI and earlier to the Kalpataru of Amalananda) the famed author of the work प्रकटार्थविवरणम् (and a number of works on Advaita) has authored a commentary on the माण्डूक्योपनिषद्भाष्यम् as well.  
  

Yes, I have seen this commentary albeit several years ago when I studied this whole issue.  

  
\> \[There is a line अत्रैते श्लोका भवन्ति (as it appeared even when the first set of shlokas occurred at the end of the sixth mantra एष सर्वेश्वर... ) At that juncture Shankara's commentary to that line was: अत्रैतस्मिन्यथोक्तेऽर्थे एते श्लोका भवन्ति ।. Here too, at the commencement of the 24th kArikA this अत्रैते श्लोका भवन्ति line occurs in the text and Shankara says: just पूर्ववत् (अत्रैते श्लोका भवन्ति). \] anubhUtisvarUpAchArya says here:

\>  
\> In the above commentary this 12th century Acharya has stated beyond doubt that the entire verse-portion of the Agama prakaraNam is the composition of GaudapAda.  
  

I'm afraid I don't see this as unambiguous; one has to read श्लोका आचार्येण प्रणीताः as meaning verses composed by Gauḍapāda, which is certainly a plausible interpretation but hardly a compelling one inasmuch as प्रणीता need not only mean "composed" -- it could also refer to something existing but brought forward, etc.  
  
If I had to make a case for Gauḍapāda's authorship I would put forward Sureśvara's नैष्कर्म्यसिद्धि statement एवं गौदैर्द्राविडैर्नः पूज्यैरयमर्थः प्रभाशितः, as better evidence than the above (earlier, more highly regarded author too). However, neither is clearly stating that the verses were composed by Gauḍapāda (while a number of sources are clearly calling them as श्रुति), and this approach essentially comes down to saying that stalwarts like Vidyāraṇya, Appayya, and even Śankara and Rāmānuja were imbeciles who did not understand tradition. It also leads to problematic consequences like T.M.P. Mahadevan's "two Ānandagiris" theory.
