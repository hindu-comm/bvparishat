In the words of MahamahopAdhyaya Ganganath Jha: Khandana-Advaitasiddhi-Citsukhi constitute the triple "hard nut" of the Neo-Vedantin, to the kernel whereof, in the language of the Pathashalas, the "beak of intelligence" finds it difficult to reach. (Preface to the Advaitasiddhi, Sri Satguru Publications, Second Edition 1990)  
The definition of mithyAtva or anirvachanIyatva or sadasadvilakShaNatva, being an important topic of the second mentioned work is part of the "hard nut" that is referred to above. In general, difficulty in understanding something could result in confused understanding, and this is what I am referring to. I hope I have made myself clear.
