Dear Scholars of the Forum,

Hari Om. Pranams.

  

The bāhyavāyu is considered to be of 7 types. They are named: āvaha, pravaha, udvaha, samvaha, vivaha, parivaha, and parāvaha.

  

Of them āvaha is *ābhimukham āgacchan vāyu* and pravaha is *purutaḥ gacchan vāyu*.

  

Can someone enlighten me about the other five? This question has reference to the Śaṅkarabhāṣya of Muṇḍaka-upaniṣad, 2.1.3.

  

Grateful.

  

In Shri Guru Smriti,

Advayananda
