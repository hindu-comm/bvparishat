Namaste  
  
Further to the announcement made earlier, here is a latest development:  
  
//

*Dear Students / Scholars,*



The Sanskrit Sahityotsava function will be held in Ujjain from 21st to 24th Feb. 2013. Most of the students and scholars are interested in participating in this programme. Many students of the Adarsha Maha Vidyalayas/University, have requested PPSM to postpone the Nyaya- Advaita Vedanta- Dviata Vedanta Workshop, to the month of May 2013. Later programme dates will be intimated to the participants.
