This is precisely the reason for my slightly tongue-in-cheek comment about "traditional and traditionalist scholars of modern times, with allegiance to advaita vedAnta" in my earlier post.I'm sure you know what my opinion is, with respect to Prof. T M P Mahadevan's postulation of "two" Anandagiri-s.



Among a certain set of advaita scholars from Tamil Nadu within the last 100-150 years, there is a striking tendency to postulate at least two of almost every noted writer in the tradition, starting with "two" Sankara-s (one Adi and one abhinava). There are other messy reasons for these scholars to propound such ideas, which I won't enter into here, except to say that these reasons often remain unstated in their academic papers and scholarly publications, but come forth in what they have written for a general audience.
