नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

Dr Narasinga Rao  

  

’By the time the Taittiriya Brahmana was written, the grammatical forms had changed somewhat.  
  
Your quote from the Atharva Veda (9.10.21) is incorrect - the word used is गौः and not गौरी ’-----  

  

1.All my postings follow the premise - वेदः अपौरुषेयः , not written by human beings .

  

All the Branches were available to Panini ,Jaimini , Patanjali etc.

  

A single शब्द may have variations .

  

2. The quotations and numbers are taken from वैदिकसर्वस्वम् by श्री लंक वेङ्कट्रामशास्त्रिसोमयाजी , 1984 , अमलापुरम्, आन्ध्रप्र्देश् ।

  

in fact , there are many errors in the book , both in letters and numbers .

Thanks for correction in ऋग्वेद ।

  

अथर्ववेदमन्त्रः --

  

In the अथर्ववेदसंहिता published by Nag Prakasak , Delhi , 1994 it is - गौरिन्मिमाय

I saw this before posting but did not discuss and left it to scholars - that too it is Bonus Info .

  

Anyway I am thankful for the alert .

  

धन्यो’स्मि
