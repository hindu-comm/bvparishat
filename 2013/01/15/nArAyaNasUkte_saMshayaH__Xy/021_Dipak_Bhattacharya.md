Dear Professor Korada,

  
I thank you for the clarification.  
Will you permit me to give a friendly advice regarding usable editions of the Vedic Saṃhitās? For all the Saṃhitās excepting the Atharvavedic ones Mm. Pandit Satavalekar’s editions are dependable. His edition of the Śaunakīya Atharvaveda is not bad but the mss have variants. Panditji showed only the readings he believed to be true. So you miss the other ones many of which seemed preferable to me. For this reason S. P. Pandit’s edition (1894-98, reprinted Chowkhamba Kashi Sanskrit Series, 1989) is preferable. It has a critical apparatus where you will find the ms variants. Visva Bandhu Shastri’s edition (VVRI 1960-65) is not bad but it is less scientifically executed than the one by S. P. Pandit. The only advantage of Visva Bandhu’s edition is that it incorporates with its critical apparatus the variants gathered from Whitney’s notes in his 1905 HOS translation. S.P. Pandit died (1894) before Whitney’s translation was published.

 But Visva Bandhu changes the text where ever Whitney, quite whimsically, has altered the ms. reading. And in such cases Visva Bandhu’s notes do not clarify what the actual ms reading is. That creates great confusion. As a result,

Whitney's emendations compounded with the way of reporting them in the VVRI edition sometimes lead to misunderstanding about the ms-reading in the AVŚ.   

For example, AVP 18.22.10c has *jāta**ṃ jātrīr yathā hrdā*; Visva Bandhu edits the parallel AVŚ 20.48.2c as *jātá**ṃ jánir yáthā hrdā́*. Vishva Bandhu’s critical apparatus just notes जा॒त्रीर्यथा॑ शं.पा.* *meaning Pandit’s edition has *jātrī́r* while the 1856 Roth-Whitney edition reads *jánir*. It is missed that Whitney’s mss too read *jātrī́r*. Since the twentieth kāṇḍa was not translated by Whitney only those who have access to the 1856 edition will know that the reading *jātrī́r* is the uniform AVŚ reading that is confirmed as the original Atharvavedic reading by the AV Paippalāda and that *jánir* is an unauthorized whimsical and erroneous emendation by Whitney.

 Many scholars have, in this way, done havoc to our texts which we need to pay attention to. I have no time to devote to the Śaunakīya Atharvaveda but it requires a careful edition with scientific presentation of the additional manuscript readings from Whitney.

 As for the Nag publications I cannot but express my deep sorrow that such editions are coming into being and scholars are welcoming them. I shall give one example of what should not have been done but has been done. I have an edition of the ऋग्वेदसंहिता from the Nag Publishers 2004 price 150/- I have also an edition by Pandit Satavaḷekar brought out in 1956 from the Svadhyayamandal, priced Rs.12/-. Up to page 768, which comprises the text and ‘mantrasaṃkhyā’ of the Ṛgveda, the Nag Publication is a page by page reprint of Panditji’s work. Panditji’s Pariśiṣṭāni, a unique and priceless material in the Svādhyāyamandal edition, is missing in the Nag edition. The mantra index too is taken from Panditji’s edition but its page numbers are different.

 Is there none in India who can reprint in Panditji’s own name what Pandit Satavalekar had done. That will be an expensive job but will be also a *puṇyakarma*.

 It may sound like self-propaganda but I have to mention here that the emendationist tendency of self-styled ‘critical editors’ like Lanman and Whitney (now Arlo Griffiths and Witzel) has been severely criticised by me in the second and third volume of the new edition of the Paippalāda-Atharvaveda. Indian scholars are, unfortunately, prone to accept all text-criticisms done by some heedless Western scholars

 I should mention here that I do not include some editors like Winternitz, Stcherbatsky, Böhtlingk, Hoffmann etc among them.

Best
