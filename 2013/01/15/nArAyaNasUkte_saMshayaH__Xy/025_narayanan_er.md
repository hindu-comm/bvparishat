In certain metrical formation the number of syllables are counted in each of their foot. In some cases the number of metrical unit of length (in the case of vowels) or weight in conjunction (in the case of consonants) is called मात्रा also counted in each foot. We take anustubh for instance which has the unique feature of having eight syllables each intact in all the four feet of the verse. The Mahabharata, the Ramayana and the Puranas give most number of anushtubhs.  

Now, we see with स हरिः and without in those Upanisadic statements.

Professor Bhattacharya had given an example in this thread:

स ब्रह्म स शिवः सेन्द्रः (8 syllables)  

सोऽक्षरः परमः स्वराट्। (8 syllables) इत्यनुष्टुप्।  

Now let us examine the other version (irrespective whether ब्रह्म or ब्रह्मा, no harm) with स हरिः

**स ब्रह्मा स** शिवः **स हरिः** सेन्द्रः (11 syllables)  

सोऽक्षरः परमः स्वराट्। (8 syllables)  

So the criterion of 8 syllable homogeneity has been tampered here with 11 syllables in the first feet harms the anushtubh. Why we tend for an anushtubh? We see the rest two feet too:  

स एव विष्णुः स प्राणः (8 syllables)

स कालोऽग्निः स चन्द्रमाः।। (8 syllables) where such homogeneity has been maintained, to assume an anushtubh.  

Moreover, apart from the Upanisad, let us check an anushtubh in a Samhitaa:

यमाय घृतवद्धवि-(8 syllables)

र्जुहोत प्र च तिष्ठत। (8 syllables)

स नो देवेष्वायम- (8 syllables)

द्दीर्घमायुः प्र जीवसे ॥१४॥ (8 syllables)

(ऋ.वे.सं.१०.१४.१४)

Here we see the pattern is intact. So the criterion match well enough to be called an anushtubh. This is how such metric works.  

Then, if you like स हरिः there in the same foot, you have justify the metre in some other way but 75% of the mantra trend of an anushtubh works against an inclusion of स हरिः there.
