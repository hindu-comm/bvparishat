This refers to your citations under "Bonus Info" (see below). Here are my comments:  
  
By the time of Panini, the word गौरी was considered to be ङ्यन्त by 4.1.41 षिद्गौरादिभ्यश्च giving गौर + ङीष् = गौरी . Therefore there is लोप of सु by 6.1.68 हल्ङ्याभ्योदिर्घात्० giving the form in प्रथमा एकवचनं as गौरी.  
  
However during the earlier time of the RigVeda, this rule did not apply. Sayana, in his commentary on RV 1.164.41 (not 2.3.22 as quoted by you) clarifies: गौरीः गरणशीला माध्यमिका वाक् । **सुलोपाभावश्छान्दसः** ।  
  
By the time the Taittiriya Brahmana was written, the grammatical forms had changed somewhat.  
  
Your quote from the Atharva Veda (9.10.21) is incorrect - the word used is गौः and not गौरी. Here is the correct form:  
  
Samhita: गौरिन्मिमाय सलिलानि ।  
Pada: गौः । इत् । मिमाय। सलिलानि ।
