नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

Dear Prof Bhattacharya

  

I purchased 'Four Vedas for Rs 201/ ' from Nag Pub , 1994.

In fact, I did not give much thought to different editions of Vedic Texts . What all I have are printed in Telugu in Mysore and a couple of Devanagari Texts - but all of them Krishnayajurveda .

  

Now I learnt from your advice as to which is good and which is not .

  

I shall try to procure Samhitas of Mm Pundit Satavalekar and Atharvaveda
of S P Pandit (Chowkhamba) .

  

There are not many people who can judge like this.

  

I am very thankful to you for the advice.

  

regards

  

धन्यो’स्मि
