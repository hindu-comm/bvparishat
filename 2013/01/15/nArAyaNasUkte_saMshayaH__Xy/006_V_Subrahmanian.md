तत्र ब्रह्मा इति न भवति वा ?  
  
Here is an audio recording of the nArAyaNasUktam rendered by traditional South Indian vedavidwans. This exactly is the way it is rendered / taught in the Sringeri MaTha. Even though the link has a text in devanAgari that gives 'brahmA', it is pronounced in the audio as 'brahma' only and the word 'sa hariH' is also present.  
  
Also, in Veda, the recitation according to the guru-shishya parampara is more authoritative than manuscripts.

I wanted to find out if the sUktam is being rendered in any different way, in the South or North India, than the recording shown here.
