The word ब्रह्म and ब्रह्मा both *can* mean the chaturmukha brahma or kArya brahma or apara brahma (the entity that is responsible for the 'creation' action.

In the Prashnopanishad 5.2 there occurs a mantra:  
  
तस्मै स होवाच एतद्वै सत्यकाम *परं चापरं च ब्रह्म* यदोंकारः। तस्माद्विद्वानेतेनैवायतनेनैकतरमन्वेति  
  
Here the commentary of Shankaracharya is: परं सत्यमक्षरं पुरुषाख्यम्
अपरं च प्राणाख्यं प्रथमजं ....\[Para brahman is the Ultimate PuruSha, the Supreme Being. apara brahman is the First-born, known as prANa\]
It is this latter that is meant by the word 'ब्रह्म’ in 'स ब्रह्म...’ in the nArAyaNa sUkta other reading.  
  
In the Brahmasutra 4.3.7 कार्यं बादरिरस्य गत्युपपत्तेः the Chandogyopanishad mantra 4.15.5 स एनान्ब्रह्म गमयति is taken for discussion and concluded that the 'brahma' here is the apara/kArya brahman (and not the Parabrahman). In that Upanishad bhAShyam too it is clarified that the 'brahma' is the one that resides in satyaloka.
