I am sorry if there is any problem in the method of my conveyance -- generally I quote that part of the posting in question and offer my response .  
  
In the present case Dr Narasinga Rao stated that Taittiriya Brahmana was written and the same cannot be accepted by tradition .  
  
He also offered a different number for the Rgveda quotation - it is a correction (Sri Sivasenani latter clarified the number I gave is correct if one follows Astaka division).  
  
Similarly , he corrected the word 'gauriimiaaya ' as 'gaurinmimaaya' in Atharvaveda . My response was that the latter is available in Nag Pblication but I took the former as it was available in another book , which may be wrong .  
  
In any case , as you rightly pointed out , the main point here is 'slight difference in the Mantra in different Vedas' .  
  
best regards
