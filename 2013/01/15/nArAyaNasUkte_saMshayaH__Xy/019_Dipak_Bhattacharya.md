Dear Colleagues,  
If correspondents inserted their replies, ie the actually new part in a reply that often carries the previous correspondences, at the top or at the end of the correspondence things would have been much clearer. Inserting in the middle creates confusion. I have not followed the actual reply in the previous mail (below) by Dr. Korada.
