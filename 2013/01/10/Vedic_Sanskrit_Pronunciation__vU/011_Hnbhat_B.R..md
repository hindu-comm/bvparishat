I remember this swapping of h x m \> m x h is discussed in other topics also. Here is one of such topics:

  

<https://groups.google.com/d/topic/panini2008/pCtXB4YSCYI/discussion>

  

and another group

  

<https://groups.google.com/d/topic/samskrita/l85fCym6klM/discussion>

  

Only Paniniya shiksha says the "h" is to be pronounced as "aurasya" in the cases specified and in others it is pronounced as कण्ठ्य. This position we do not know how to pronounce as औरस्य, and we are taught only as कण्ठ्य. 

  

  

हकारं पञ्चमैर्युक्तमन्तस्थाभिश्च संयुतम् ।

*औरस्यं तं विजानीयात्*कण्ठ्यमाहुरसंयुतम् ॥१६॥

  

It clearly says it is कण्ठ्य only when it is isolated.

  

I think somebody has quoted in the first topic some प्रातिशाख्य providing these as the examples. I am not sure. Please check.
