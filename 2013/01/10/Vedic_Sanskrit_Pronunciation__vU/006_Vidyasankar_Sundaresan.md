The Maharashtra origin Sukla yajurvedins I have heard in Mumbai, as also one Gujarati native and one Hindi native whomI have met in Philadelphia, invariably recite kha instead of sha, e.g. sahasraSIrkhA purukhaH, prathamo daivyo bhikhak, etc. The sha to kha change does not happen whenin conjunction with mUrdhanya-s, e.g. mIDhushTama, not mIDhukhTama. On enquiry, they have all said they recite as per the mAdhyandina SAkhA. I'm not sure if there is a kANva - mAdhyandina distinction behind it or if the variation is merely a function of north-south geography. Perhaps others more familiar with Sukla yajurveda traditions can elaborate. My ears being attuned to the taittirIya SAkhA, it always takes me someeffort to get into the cadence of Sukla yajus recitation!



To me,reciting kha instead of sha nevertheless looks quite logical in its own way. If the S \<-> kinterchange is an ancient one, so thatIE languages can be grouped as per Satamvs. kentum, then sha \<-> kha seems like a natural extension of the same underlying linguistic process and it should also be equally ancient.A further observation:What is mostnoteworthy is that thisusage of the kha soundhas been preserved in some traditions of veda reciters in India, all through the millenia whenclassical Sanskrit and the other spoken languages around them were pointing to sha instead.



I will not speculate on what this means for linguistic diversity and "original homes" of the speakers of IE languages. :)

ps. I've changed the subject line becausemy commentshave ventured into an area beyond pronunciation within the context of Sanskrit and the veda.
