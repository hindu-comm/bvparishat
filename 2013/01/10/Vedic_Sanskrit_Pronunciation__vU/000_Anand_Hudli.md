Dear Scholars,  
  
Despite the presence of various शिक्षा texts and the प्रतिशाख्य's, there is variation in the pronunciation of certain akSharas in Vedic chanting. For example, I have heard some pundits affiliated with the Kanchi Math chanting the Rg veda and I have observed that they pronounce "श" more  
like "स", although the pronunciation of "ष" is fine. Similarly, I have heard chanting of the PaippalAda shAkhA of the atharva veda by Orissa pundits, and again, the "श" sounds like"स".  I have heard many pundits from Karnataka and they do pronounce "श" correctly. I have not  
heard Northern pundits chanting the Veda much, but the "ज्ञ" sounds like "ग्य", and "ऋ" like "रि". I have watched a video of a pUrnamAseShTi in Pune, where the shukla yajur veda priests pronounce "ष" like "ख". I understand that regional variations in pronunciation do exist  
and they are acceptable in everyday (laukika) speech, but when it comes to recitation of Vedas, how can there such variations in pronunciation?  
  
Regards,  
  
Anand
