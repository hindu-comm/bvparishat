Regarding your second point, whenever अनुस्वार is followed by य् , व् ,or ल् , it is optionally (although generally in practice) rendered as the nasalized version of these semi-vowels. The relevant rules are:  
  
8.4.58 अनुस्वारस्य ययि परसवर्णः and 8.4.59 वा पदान्तस्य .  
  
In his commentary on 8.4.59, Bhattorji says अत्रानुस्वारस्य पक्षेऽनुनासिका यवलाः and gives the following examples: सँय्यन्ता , संयन्ता , सँव्वत्सरः , संवत्सरः , यँल्लोकम् , यं लोकम् (Actually the anunasika symbol should come on the first य् , व्, and ल् respectively, but Barah does not allow an anunasika symbol over a consonant without a vowel).  
  
The interchange of म् and ह् in common parlance has always intrigued me, and I am waiting for an answer from the scholars...
