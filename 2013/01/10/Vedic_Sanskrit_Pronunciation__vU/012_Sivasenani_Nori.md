WhenI started learning Sanskrit some 8 years back, Ihad asked a similar question and I remember having been told that the TaittirIyaprAtiSAkhya sUtra 21-24 namely



हकारान्नणमपरान्नासिक्यम् ॥२१-१४ ॥

hakArAnnaNamaparAnnAsikyaM 21-14



means that where na, Na, ma occur after'ha' (as in vahni, grihNAti, Brahma)the 'ha' is nasalised; due to the association with an anunAsika, the effect is to have the nasal-anunAsika(i.e, the sound similar to the anunAsikA associated with ha, inserted due to nasalization of ha)\[1\]
inserted before the samyuktAkshara, i.e. we would have van.hni, griN.hNAti and bram.hma whre n., N., and m. stand for the nasal-anunAsika.



We are not capable of pronouncing the nasal ha followed by the anunAsika and so end up dropping the latteranunAsikA, or it is pronounced but we donot perceive it.



I am not sure-footed regarding the above, learning that, as I did, at early stages.I would like to know the correct interpretation from scholars. (As luck would have it, the copyI have of Dwight's edition has that particular page missing)

\[1\] the convoluted term 'nasal-anunAsikA' is my inelegant coinage. The idea is to differentiate the first 'inserted'anunAsikA sound associated with 'ha' due to nasalization of 'ha' from the latter one whichisthere by rights in the word.
