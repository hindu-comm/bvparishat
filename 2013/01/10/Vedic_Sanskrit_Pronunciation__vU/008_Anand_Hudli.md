I have observed, while traveling in Udipi, that "ब्रह्म" (brahma) (example, Rg veda 1.10.4) is pronounced not as "bramha", interchanging the "h" and "m' sounds, but exactly the way it is written, "brahma." In other contexts, I have heard "prahlAda" being pronounced the same as "prahlAda", without interchanging the "h" and "l" sounds, in which case it would sound like "pralhAda". I have also heard variations, for example in the Rudra mantra, "स्तुहि श्रुतं गर्तसदं युवानं...", where most Karnataka based reciters pronounce the "M" ending of "gartasadaM" with a kind of nasal "ai" sound (since it is being followed by a "yu"). Other reciters may not follow this method.
