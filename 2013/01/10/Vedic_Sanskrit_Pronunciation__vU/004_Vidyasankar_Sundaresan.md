On this note,I have heard at least one recitation of the yajurveda camaka , where ऋ has explicitly become its guNa form ar, e.g. arddhaM ca me arddhiS ca me, ...artuS ca me, etc. I believe there is one such recording available on [youtube.com](http://youtube.com).



As far as pronouncing "ख" instead of "ष" is concerned, I was under the impression that this is an acknowledged and ancient feature of Sukla yajus recitation. If so, this cannot be compared with possible regionalvernacular influenced deviations from ideal pronunciation.
