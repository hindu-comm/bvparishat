I decided to look up the internet and see if the missing page could be found. It was indeed to be found. The same is reproduce below. Also reproduced below are three other commentaries (one, only partially) and another similar rule in Atharva-Veda PraatiSaakhya (which also explains why we have a similar situation when ha is followed by semi-vowels). There are two more rules quoted in Rik-PraatiSaakhya and Vaajasaneyi PraatiSaakhya, but I have not yet looked them up. The material reproduced below is also attached as .pdf (in case Gmail does not handle the formatting properly).

 *Hakārād iti karmaṇi lyablope pañcamī. tasmāt naṇamaparaṃ hakāramāruhya nāsikyam bhavati: anunāsikyo hakāraḥ syādityarthaḥ. ahnāṃ \_ \_ \_ \_ . apar- \_ \_ \_ \_. brahm- \_ \_ \_ \_.*



14. After *h,* when followed by *n, ṇ,* or *m,* is inserted *nāsikhya.*



 I have translated this rule according to its obvious and incontrovertible meaning, which, if it needed any external support, would find it in the almost precisely accordant rule of the Ath. Pr. (i.100: the teachings of the other treatises upon the subject are much less distinct: see the note on the Atharvan rule). But the commentator gives it an entirely different interpretation. The ablative *hakārāt*, he says, is here used in the sense of an accusative (his addition, “in the absence of *lyap* \[the suffix *ya*\],” I do not understand); and the sense is, that a nose-sound is imposed upon the *h* itself, or that the latter becomes nasal. It is not difficult to see on what this theory of the quality of a *h* preceding a nasal is founded – namely, a recognition of the fact that such a *h* is really an expiration of breath through the nose: it being not less true of *h* before a semivowel or nasal than before a vowel, that it is (borrowing, the phraseology of an earlier rule, ii.47[\[2\]](https://mail.google.com/mail/?shva=1#_ftn2)) *udayasvarādisthāna* ‘produced in the position of the succeeding letter.’ The commentator’s exposition might have come from the “some authorities” to whom the doctrine of that rule is attributed.



 The examples given are *ahnāṃ ketuḥ* (ii.4.14), *aparāhṇe* (ii.1.2⁵), and *brahmavādinaḥ* (i.7.1⁴ et. Al.). Giving to the rule its real meaning, and applying the principle laid down at xxi.8 for the syllabic division, we should read *ahh^(-n)nām*: and so with the rest. As was suggested under Ath. Pr. i.100, it is probably this separation of the *h* from the nasal in syllabication that has led to the division of the two in point of utterance, and then to the thrusting in between them of a transition-sound.



 G. M. have adapted the reading of the rule to the new interpretation, and give *hakārān naṇamaparan nāsikyam* (the writing of *n* instead of *ṃ* before *n* is frequent with these MSS).

VI. Atharva-Veda Prātiśākhya with Whiteny’s commentary / notes



हकारान्नासिक्येन ॥१-१००॥



 100. After *h* is inserted in like manner a *nāsikya* before a nasal mute.



 The commentator paraphrases with *hakārāt nāsikyena samānpade vyavadhānam bhavati*; and adds as illustrations a part of the words already once given, under rule 58: viz. *prāṇaḥ, pūrvāhṇaḥ, aparāhṇaḥ, apa hmalayati, vi hmalayati, vi hnute, brahma.*



 The Taitt. Pr. (xxi. 14) teaches the insertion of a *nāsikya* after *h* and before a following nasal in terms nearly equivalent to those of our own rule. The Ṛk Pr. (i.10, r.48, xlix) and the Vāj. Pr. (i.74,80) describe its mode of pronunciation, as a nose sound; and the latter, in its latest portion (vii.28), speaks of it again smong the constituents of the spoken alphabet; but, strangely enough, neither of them gives any rule respecting its occurrence.



 What the sound may be which is thus taught to form the step of transition from the aspiration to a following nasal, it is hard to say with confidence. I can only conjecture it to be a brief expulsion of surb breath through the nose, as continuation of the *h,* before the expulsion of the sonant breath which constitutes the nasal. The pure aspiration *h* is a corresponding surd to all the sonant vowels, semivowels, and nasals of the alphabet that is to say, it is produced by an expulsion of breath through the mouth organs in any of the position in which those letters are uttered; it has no distinctive position of its own, but is determined in its mode of pronunciation by the letter with which it is most nearly connected. Thus the *h’s* of *ha,* of *hi,* of *hu,* and those before heard before the semivowels *w* and *y* in the English words *when* and *hue,* for instance, are all different in position, corresponding in each case with the following vowel or semivowel. *H* is usually initial in a word or syllable, and is governed by the letter which succeeds, and not by that which precedes it: but where it occurs before another consonant in the middle of a word – which is always its position in the Vedas before a nasal – the question may arise whether it shall adopt the mode of utterance of the letter before or after it: whether in *brahma*, for example, we divide *brah. ma,* and pronounce the *h* in the position of the *a*, or *brah. ma*, and in the position of the *m,* through the nose. According to the Hindu method of syllabication (see rule 56, above), the former is the proper division and the Hindu phonetists doubtless regarded the *h* as belonging with and uttered like *a*; and noticing at the same time the utterance, scarcely to be avoided, of at least a part of the *h* in the position of the *m,* they took account of it as a separate element, and called it *nāsikya.*
