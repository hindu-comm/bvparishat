Sir



Thank you.



The short answer is - I do not know. I have similar doubts. There is one more vyAkhyAna called lakshaNachandrikA - which might explain it better. Hopefully, in the near future, I will study the PraatiSaakhyas (Tai., Atha., Rik, Vaaj.), try to internalize their method of presentation and see if the commentaries make better sense after that.



Long time back, in one sabha, I heard one Vedic scholar give the lakshaNa of the word called Brahma. I cannot say that I followed all of what was said. To the extent I can recollect, the attempt was to show how to pronounce the word, drawing on SikshA etc., proving the sAdhurUpam using Vyakarana, and establishing the meaning as per Nirukta etc. I did not ask a more pointed question at that time, because a) I had no easy access and b) an earlier attempt to interact with a salakshaNaghanApaTI (about what constitutes 'lakshaNa' proved to me that I have not graduated to the level where I can meaningful interact with such people (either they start at a very basic level and before anything new can be said, it would be kaalaatikramaNa for something or the other, or start quoting certain statements without saying where they occur, and without attmepting to connect those sentences). If one is able to get across a printed version of the lakhsaNa (or whatever it is called) for the word 'Brahma' may be this point could get clarified.
