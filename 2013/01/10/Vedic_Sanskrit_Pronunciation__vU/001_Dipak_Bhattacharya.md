\<Similarly, I have heard chanting of the PaippalAda shAkhA of the atharva veda by Orissa pundits, and again, the "श" sounds like"स"\>

Accusation about Paippalāda pronunciation proceeds from unawareness of the position of this śākha and the condition of its adherents. Till 1959 it was a ‘lost’ śākhā. After the discovery in that year of living Paippalāda tradition in Odisha and South-West Bengal by Dugamohan Bhattacharyya and after the consternation it caused particularly in the West, some awareness came to be visible very slowly. Still, as late as 1964 the librarian of the Emar math was unwilling to believe that manuscripts of the Paippalāda recension were being edited. I succeeded in making him believe by showing him a copy of the printed text of the first volume edited by the discoverer and published by the Sanskrit College Calcutta. His reaction was the exclamation ‘By God! Can we now turn copper into gold?’

One may note from the literature produced by the discoverer and later by the present writer (Introduction, Volume I, 1997) how much neglect the Paippalāda recension had been subjected to. The Vedas and Vedic tradition had been kept alive by the big Maṭhas, particularly by Śṛṅgerī. The Paippalādins were deprived of that favour. The patronisation of the king had been lacking by the seventeenth century. The attention of Kāñcī had been drawn after the publication of the second volume in 1970. It was in the eighties that arrangement for svādhyāya could be made and funded, thanks particularly to Pandi Nanaji Kale of Barshi.

That somewhat improved the situation. But one has still a long way to go for accented svādhyāya. I had been requested by emissaries of the late Periyar Chandrakharendra Saraswatī to bring out an accented text. Later I got the same request from Pandit Kale. But the manuscripts are corrupt due to break and decline in svādhyāya tradition caused by the poverty of the Paippalādins. There is no accent mark. The text too is often very corrupt. My first task is to present to the readers an intelligible text with sufficient comments on the choice of reading.

With the completion of the fourth and last volume (in press now) of the present critical edition one can think of an accented text. Before that one has to bear with the present condition that has come into being under abnormal circumstances. The svadhyāyins of Odisha are not to be blamed.

Best wishes for all!
