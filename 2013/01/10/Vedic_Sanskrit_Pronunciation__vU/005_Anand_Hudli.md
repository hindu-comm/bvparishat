Dear Vidyasankar,  
  
I have heard the recitation of parts of the kANva shAkhA of the shukla yajurveda by Shri Parasurama Sastri and his disciples from Tamil Nadu. I have also heard some local (Bengaluru) students of the kANva shAkhA. The "ष" is pronounced as usual with no change. Is the change from "ष" to "ख" peculiar to the Northern tradition?  
  
Anand
