Dear Shri Bhattacharya,  
  
I am not making accusations against anyone but asking whether such pronunication variations are acceptable in vedic chanting. For example, that the "DaLayor abhedaH" rule is accepted is common knowledge. The Rg vedic "La" gets replaced with  
"Da" in the yajurveda. For the record, the shaunakIya shAkhA recitation CDs produced by Veda Prasar Samiti have the correct pronunciation of "श".  
  
Regards,  
  
Anand
