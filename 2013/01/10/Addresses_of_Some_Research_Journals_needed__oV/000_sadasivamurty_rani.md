Pranams to all.  
As all of you know in the recent times there have been many changes in the instructions to the Ph.D., pursuers in Sanskrit. Accordingly they have to get at least two of their papers published in any reputed research journals. Some of the research scholars requested me to help them with addresses of any Sanskrit reasearch journals. Hence this mail is submitted to you all. Can any one please help me with the addresses of such Sanskrit Research Journals which encourage the publication of the articles of upcoming research scholars? I heard that some journals on collecting some nominal subscription publishing the articles. These research scholars are prepared even to pay such subscription. So you may please oblige me with the addresses of such research magazines.  
Warm reagrds,
