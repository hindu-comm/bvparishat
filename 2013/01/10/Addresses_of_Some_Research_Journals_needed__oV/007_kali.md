Sarvebhyo NamaskaraH,



Thanks to all scholars who have provided the list as well as valuable info on the Research journals in Sanskrit and Indological research.



At the outset itself, I would like to register my ignorance on the ongoing research in sanskrit, and hence the following questions:



In the same vein, can I request for info on the books/journals regarding "Research Methodologies" in Sanskrit medium? In the absence of which, do we have to necessarily

rely onself-translations of the Research Methods as available in English medium? Is there a standardized text of the terminologies equivalent to those used in common

Research Methodologies like Approaches to Research, Types of Research, Project Planning, Selecting a topic, Statement of Hypothesis, Research Design,

Literature Research, Hypothesis Testing,etc., ? How different is the approach, planning, preparation and submission of Dissertation or Thesis with regard toResearchpresentation per se

when it comes to Sanskrit as it is submitted to Sanskrit departments?



I have these doubts since I am currently doing MPhil(sanskrit) in Madras university. I am aware of the fact that the disseration or Thesis can be submitted in either English or Sanskrit medium, or

a combination of both.



However, I am interestedto confining myselfexclusively in Sanskrit medium.



I would welcomesuggestions in this regard which will be very useful to my current task.
