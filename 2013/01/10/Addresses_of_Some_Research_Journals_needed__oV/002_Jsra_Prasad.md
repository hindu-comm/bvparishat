Dear Sir,  
  
You may be aware that Shiksha Sudha from Puri particularly encourages  
papers from research scholars. But the subject it deals with is  
Shiksha Sastra/Education. Dr.Ramakant Mishra is the chief editor and  
journal charges are very nominal.  
  
There are some other web based/print journals which collect a sum  
ranging between Rs. 1000-1500/- Personally I am not happy with the  
quality/content as most of them are commercial. सारस्वती सुषमा of  
Dept. of Research&Publications, Sampurnananda University, Banaras is  
an excellent old journal, but doesn't carry an ISSN.  
  
One may also find Dr.R.N.Pandey's call for papers for his journal  
IJIS, in BVP archives.  
A link - <http://newsphilosophy.wordpress.com/> gives us the  
notifications for seminars/conference/workshops/call for papers,  
periodically.  
  
The attached pdf file prepared by RsKs is worth to know more about  
indological/Sanskrit journals. Assumably, a simple google search may  
reveal journals addresses.  
  
Regards,  
Prasad
