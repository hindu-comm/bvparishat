Thanks Srinivasan Acharya.



I agree with your glorification of Krishna. You agreed that Jarasandha of Magadha was powerful. You agreed that Krishna and his people moved away from Jarasandha. This is I wanted.



Now please check the following things in your Mahabharata. Arjuna had war with Hansadvaja of Campaa nagari and Arjuna killed his two sons. Then Hansadvaja entered the battlefield. After some time of fighting Krisna saw danger to Arjuna's life from Hansadvaja. Then Krishna intervened and pacified Hansadvaja and told him to support Arjuna in future.Next Arjuna was killed in the war with Babhruvaahana. Ulupi-Naaga kanya retrived him. What I am trying to make the point is that kings east of Ganga river were more powerful than Kurus in the west. Finally I would like you to check when did Arjuna go to Ladies Kingdom and what was the out come of that fight. Did Arjuna defeat the Ladies kingdom or he made truce with them by let Pramila (Sanskritized name) marry her. Thanks for your interest. N.R.Joshi.
