Dear Shrisha Rao, Namaste!



Here is my understanding. Two wives of Kansa were daughters of Jarasandha of Magadha. After Krisna killed Kansa, wives of Kansa told their father to take revenge. That was the starting point of enmity between Krishna and his clan Yadavas. There were many battles among them. In order to avoid more blood bath, Krishna decided to move away from Jarasanda. They moved to the area we call now Kaccha (Gujarata State). There they build Dvaraka-the golden city. If you have information different from this please post it here so I will correct myself in my understanding of this ancient history. Thanks. N.R.Joshi

What is the textual (or other) basis for this opinion?  
  
\> It is Krishna who got Jarasandha killed because of enmity. He had to run away from his own relativeJarasandha and relate himself to Pandavas.  
  
That requires acceptance of a strange principle, whence someone (e.g., Krishna) must consider one's maternal uncle's father-in-law (e.g., Jarasandha) as a relative, more so than first cousins (e.g., Pandavas).
Many people would have difficulty with this premise -- first cousins are often close, sometimes almost like siblings, while an uncle's father-in-law could well be a perfect stranger.  
  
Regards,
