Dear Dr Sadasivsmurty Rani,



Thanks for your input.



I have no problem with your posting on Krishna, Jarasandha, Kaalayavana, Dvaraka, and Mucukunda. However I would like to bring your attention the following information.



You posted ,"But here I would like to place my observation that the story of Arjuna's death in the hands of Ulupi's son, or the Kingdom of Pramila and the Episode of Hansadhvaja are all parts of Jaiminiya Bharata but are not found in the Vyasa's Mahabharata (up to Svargarohana parava).. Jaminiya Bharata doesn't enjoy the status of an ITIHASA as Vyasa's Mahabharata does and it is much more considered as a fictitious composition. So any of the episodes from it cannot be considered authentic."



It is personal choice to decide which book of the Mahabharata is authentic. First Babhruvahana was the son of the lady Chitrangada. He was not the son of Ulupi.



Next one cannot deny the existence of Ladies Kingdom of Pramila. Archaeological excavations in the Sinkyang province of China has unearthed the Ladies Kingdom. This is known all over the world. In 2009 Houston Museum of Fine Arts with the permission of the Afghanistan government brought all artifacts to USA and displayed them in the museum for months.



Main parties of Mahabharata conflicts were concentrated in the west in the lands now occupied by Pakistan and Afghanistan. Also one cannot deny existence of Naaga people in the ancient India. Takshaka was Naaga so was Ulupi.



For your information Kurus were not powerful all the time. King Samvarana (father of Kuru) has to run away from his enemies and hide around the Sindhu river. Could you please tell me from which direction Samvarana and his people reached Sindhu from the east of Sindhu or from the west of Sindhu? One time Shalvas drove away Kurus from Kurukshetra. After Janamejaya Paarikshit Kurus suffered their second misfortune due to locusts. It is only due the power of Bhisma and help of Krishna Kurus prospered for short time less that hundred years. Your input is appreciated. Thanks. N.R.Joshi.

Pranams to all.  
The on going discussion on Jasrasandha and also on the prowess of Kurus and the people on the other side of the river Ganga is interesting.
