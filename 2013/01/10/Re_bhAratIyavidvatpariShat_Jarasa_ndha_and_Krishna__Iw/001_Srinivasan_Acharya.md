Dear Sirs,

Namamsi,

  

\> It is Krishna who got Jarasandha killed because of enmity. He had to run away from his own relative Jarasandha and relate himself to Pandavas.

  

Bhagavan Srikrishna did not kill King Jarasandha because of enemity. Please refer to Mahabharata 0202211 “manuṣyāṇāṁ samālambhaḥ na ca dṛṣṭaḥ kadācana \| sa kathaṁ mānuṣairdevaṁ śaṅkaraṁ yaṣṭumicchasi \|\|”

  

By killing Jarasandha, Krishna freed 22000 princes, who were supposed to be slayed as offering to lord Shiva. Moreover, Krishna crowns the son of Jarasandha, Sahadeva as the king of Magadha land and does not become himself.

  

The texts have also pictured the fear of Krishna that Jarasandha had. Jarasandha forms a huge army of 23 Akshohini, attacks Krishna 22 times, and fails to kill mere 11-year-old lad. Krishna was of 55 while Jarasandha and Bhima fought each.
