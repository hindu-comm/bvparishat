Pranams to all.  
The on going discussion on Jasrasandha and also on the prowess of Kurus and the people on the other side of the river Ganga is interesting.  
  
1. But here I would like to place my observation that the story of Arjuna's death in the hands of Ulupi's son, or the Kingdom of Pramila and the Episode of Hansadhvaja are all parts of Jaiminiya Bharata but are not found in the Vyasa's Mahabharata (up to Svargarohana parava)..
Jaminiya Bharata doesn't enjoy the status of an ITIHASA as Vyasa's Mahabharata does and it is much more considered as a fictitious composition. So any of the episodes from it cannot be considered authentic.  
2. Regarding the war between Sri Krishna and Jarasandha also it took place for 18 times between them. But a careful reading can give us information that in the first 17 times Sri Krishna was not defeated by Jarasandha.Instead having utterly defeated Jarasandha, Srikrishna left him with lives out of mercy. Eighteenth time Krishna had a strategic plan in his mind. He foresaw that Jarasandha would be taking the help of Kalayavana whose death is destined to happen else where. As thought of by Krishna, Jarasandha attacked Krishna with the support of Kalayavana. In the meanwhile Srikrishna with the help of Vishvakarma built a big wealthy city named Dwaraka in middle of the Sea and shifted all the inhabitants of Madhura to the new city. Later having narrated his plan to Balabhdra he deviated Kalayavana towards a deserted mountain. Kalayavana started chasing Krishna. Krishna entered the cave where since Treata Yuga a king named MUCUKUNDA, a descendant of Ikshvaku's race, the son of Mandhata, has been in Yoganidra . Krishna hid himself behind a stone. Kalayavana wrongly perceived MUCHUKUNDA for KRISHNA and kicked him. Soon Muchukunda opened his eyes by the power of the Yogic fire emitted from his eyes the demon Kalayavana reduced to ashes. Later Srikrishna came back to Madhura and killed all the soldiers of Kalayavana and started taking away all the riches left by Kalayavana there to Dwaraka. In the meanwhile Jarasandha again attacked both Krishna and Balarama there. Pretending as if they were afraid of Jarasandha both the brothers (Krishna and Balarama) ran towards PRAVARSHANA GIRI. Jarasandha surrounded the mountain and burnt it from all sides. Without being noticed by Jarasandha those two slipped off to Dwaraka. Here the strategy of Srikrishna is that that mountain was full of poisonous snakes and other harmful beings. It should be burnt to protect all the surrounding inhabitants from those snakes and other such beings. Hence that incident was developed.  
  
3. More over Krishna clearly knows that the death of Jarasandha is destined to happen in the hands of Bhima. Hence he did not kill him. Other wise killing Jarasandha was not a problem for Krishna.  
  
Hence correlating these incidents for a new theory that the people on the other banks of Ganga are more powerful than KURUS may be reconsidered.
