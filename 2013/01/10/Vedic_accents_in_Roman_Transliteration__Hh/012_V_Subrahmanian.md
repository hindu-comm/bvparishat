In South Indian traditions there is another peculiarity:  
  
For words like तस्मिन्सहस्रशाखे that occurs in the Taittiriyopanishat शीक्षावल्ली ४, the Kannada printed books render it as: 
ತಸ್ಮಿನ್ಥ್ಸಹಸ್ರಶಾಖೇ, तस्मिन्थ्सहस्रशाखे the थ् inclusion is required.
Some have said that this is the Andhra style and that is widely prevalent in the South. (I have not given the notation here).  
  
For the word श्रेयान् occurring in this very upanishat श्रेयान् वस्यसोऽसानि स्वाहा, one has to give a short pause after श्रेयान् with a kind of नु sound at the end like the Tamils would pronounce the English word 'pin' with a stress on the 'n' பின்னு. It is not like the Kannadigas would pronounce the word 'pin' ಪಿನ್ನು.

Yes. The srIrudraprashna word ’वर्षमिषवस्तेभ्यो’ pronounced as ’वरुषमिषवस्तेभ्यो’ is another example. Again the sound उ here for रु is like the Tamils pronouncing the word varuSham வருஶம் and not like the Kannadigas pronouncing the word haruSha ಹರುಷ.
