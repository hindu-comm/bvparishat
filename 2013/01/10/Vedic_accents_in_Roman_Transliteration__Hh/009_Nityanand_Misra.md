The examples are in the thread (Navagraha Sukta) and the two PDFs (Purusha Sukta and others) for which the link I posted earlier. Krishnan compares differences in marking Svaras within two Taittiriya traditions, along with introduction of additional vowels.  
  
आयूं॑िष vs आयूिष  
िपन्व॑न्न॒जरं॑ सु॒वीरम् v/s िपन्व॑न्न॒जर सु॒वीरम्  
अतो॒ ज्यायांश्च॒ पूरु॑षः v/s अतो॒ ज्यायाश्च॒ पूरु॑षः  
पर्ौक्ष॑न् v/s पर्ौक्षन्न्  
  
In Navagraha Sukta readings we find a svara mark over the terminal consonant न् of विपश्यन् to render which, the reciters add a short vowel and another न् after न्.  
  
It is not uncommon to hear सहस्रशीर्षा as सहस्रशीरषा. Even in the Gayatri वरेण्यम् is almost universally pronounced as वरेणियम्.  
  
The pronunciation of ऋ as रि/रु, ष as ख, ज्ञ as ग्य/ग्न/ज्न are near universal in most oral traditions.
