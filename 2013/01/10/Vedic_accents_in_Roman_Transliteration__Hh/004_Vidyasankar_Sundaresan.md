Dear Prof. Bhattacharya,



Thank you for these clarifications (and Sri Nityanand Misra as well; the references from Sri Yudhishthira Mimamsaka are especially useful for me to understand the historical context of writing and notating the veda).



I agree that if one already knows the rules, then marking udAtta and jAtyasvarita would be sufficient. However, my personal experience is that it still makes it difficult in trying to relate the written text to the oral one, requiring a significant cognitive shift on the part of the reader. If one must be a likhita-pAThaka, then at least the lekhana could make it easier for someone who does not typically start off knowing all the SikshA, prAtiSAkhya and vyAkaraNa rules governing the sound of the recitation. At least, such is my opinion.



Anyway, the reason I got interested in the historicity of the notational marks used with writing the veda goes back to the discussion we had recently about the metrically restored Rgveda. I had taken issue with the UT Austin scholars for inserting vowels in almost every instance of conjunct consonants. I noticed that this practice also plays havoc with the accents that need to be applied. I mention two instances here, for the sake of the record.



For example, from the pavamAna sUkta, the UT Austin metric restorers want us to read



9.001.05a   tuvā^(́)m áchā carāmasi  
9.001.05b   tád íd árthaṃ divé-dive  
9.001.05c   índo tuvé na āśásaḥ  
  
This introduces a syllable "tu" in the first line, which now will haveto be recited anudAtta, totally artificially, but quite as per the rules, whereas what is actually recited is udAtta "tvā^(́)m". Similarly, in the last line, "índo tuvé" would now require an artificialanudAtta on "tu" and an equally artificial svarita on the syllable "do" -againtotally as per the rules! In actual recitation, as the syllable "do" is is sandwiched between two udAtta syllables, "ín" and "tvé", its pitch value remains low and never rises to where a svarita would lie. At least in the taittirIya prAtiSAkhya, there is an explicit rule about this and I would assume that the Rk-prAtiSAkhya also has one, because that ishow Rgvedins actually recite it. Writing "tvé" as "tuvé" would make the situation quite different.



Another instance where accent problems occur comeswithina few versesin the same hymn:



9.001.09a   abhī^(́)mám ághniyā utá  
9.001.09b   śrīṇánti dhenávaḥ śíśum  
9.001.09c   sómam índrāya pā^(́)tave  
  
The restorers have an udAtta marking on the syllable bhi in the first line, whereas it is a svarita that would typically be depicted with the number 3 following bhi,with an underscore below it and a vertical line above it.



The attempt at metric restoration, combined with the standard academic practice ofnot marking anudAtta and svarita,therefore has far reaching consequences and takes the written notated text quite far away from theactually recited text. Such examples abound!



One could of course argue that the reciters have not maintained fidelity with what the text "should" be, but I would much rather privilege the tradition of recitation in such matters, especially for such a well preserved oral text as the Rgveda.



Namaskaras,

Vidyasankar
