I had been following the discussion, with the received sound by us as interposed hna, hma, hNa etc. by us as the real sound produced by the recitation of the Vedic Mantra-s. My doubt is that there is no such interposition meant by the rule anyhow as we can understand it as explained in one of the commentary हकारात हकारमारुह्य, नासिक्यमिच्छन्ति explained resorting to "पञ्चमीविधाने ल्यप्लोपे कर्मण्युपसङ्ख्यानं ''अधिकरणे चोपसङ्ख्यान''मिति (२-३-२८-वा) वात्तिक. That much we can be sure. We have no recorded sound as explained by the commentators and on the other hand we have only in front of us what we here as interposed hn, hm etc. It may not refer to the written symbol of नासिक्य above the letter in its written form in roman and Devanagari which have their own convention of notations. 

  

This is the position with the Paniniya Shiksha also which says:

  

हकारं पञ्चमैर्युक्तमन्तःस्थाभिश्च संयुतम।

औरस्यं विजानीयात कण्ठ्यमाहुरसंयुतम॥

  

Probably following तैत्तिरीय version of the Shiksha. We know अकुहविसर्जनीयानां कण्ठः, but there is no letter औरस्य what we are familiar, to compare with this औरस्य h in the above cases, though eight articulations include उरस also in the enumeration

अष्टौ स्थानानि वर्णानामुरः कण्ठः शिरस्तथा ।

जिह्वामूलं च दन्ताश्च नासिकौष्टौ च तालु च ॥

  

This is not illustrated in SK in the explanation of the normal वर्ण-s, अकुहविसर्जनीयानां कण्ठः, etc. the यमो नाम वर्णः is explained there too:वर्गेष्वाद्यानां चतुर्णां पञ्ञ्चमे परे मध्ये यमो नाम पूर्वसदृशो वर्णः प्रातिशाख्ये प्रसिद्धः। but seems to be different than the one referred in the प्रातिशाख्य as called यम by some.

  

Any way I leave to the scholars to decide upon whether our judgment could arrive at a solution to the problem or accept what is available in the tradition. I am not Vedic scholar, that much I am certain.
