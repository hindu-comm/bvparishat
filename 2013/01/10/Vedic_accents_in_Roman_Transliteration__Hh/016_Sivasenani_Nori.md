Bhartrihari mentions "VyaakaraNasmriti" in Vakyapadiyamreferring to Ashtadhyayi and Mahabhashya. This usage implies that they are valid because they are based on Sruti and clearly expoundedfor us out of Karuna by the great Maharshis. That is why, under the sutra "prishodarAdIni yathopadishTam" (6-3-109), Bhagavan Patanjali makes it clear that SishTaprayoga is the pramANa and that the SAstra exists only to identify SishTas. So ultimately it is the usage by SishTas which makes "Sanskrit" seem so natural. So, if in Kerala the 'ta' is replaced by 'la' (pracodayAl), or 'sha' by 'kha' (purukha) in Eastern India, the SishTas in those places are the pramANa. The prAtiSAkhyas are the result of such SishTas, millenia earlier, discussing these issues in parishads and deciding these things. In other words, prAtiSAkhyas and smritis like ashTAdhyAyI are on the same footing: they codify good practices. With the one, we are used to it for so long, that anything other than that "seems" not right - like driving on the right side of the road, for many Indians - but, in fact, one is as good as the other.



Now, if the question arises as to what to do when one is confused, the Taittiriya Sruti clearly says - अथ यदि ते कर्मविचिकित्सा वा वृत्तविचिकित्सा वा स्यात् ये तत्र ब्राह्मणाः सम्मर्शिनः, युक्ताः आयुक्ताः अलूक्षा धर्मकामाः स्युः, यथा ते तत्र वर्तेरन्, तथा तत्र वर्तेथाः। (SikshAvallI, anuvAka 11).
