namaste,



\> There is a taittirIya prAtiSAkhya rule that counts anusvAra as a hrasva vowel





Ultimately, the crux of this thread is whether or not the prAtishAkhya is accepted as pramANa or not. If I am honest with myself, some renderings in some shAkhAs just seem "wrong" ... purukhaH in place of puruShaH, pracodayAl in place of pracodayAt, etc. But ...





\> That is one way to see it. The other perspective is that oral traditions have also become corrupt over ages.





Canwe really distinguish just thecorruptions from the originals. Though we can theorize, the answer is a resounding "no".There isn't going to be any major reform of thechanting tradition, nor should there be. Some people may choose to attempt"reformed" chanting methods, but these will be sideshows that live in the shadows of the tradition proper. In fact,they will only survive because of the grace of the tradition itself.



The question that most interests me is this -- does chanting the mantra according to the prAtishAkhya take one towards the mantra devatA more readily than chanting the mantra according to Sanskrit rules. Unfortunately, no amount of textual analysis can provide the answer.



sasneham,



 ajit
