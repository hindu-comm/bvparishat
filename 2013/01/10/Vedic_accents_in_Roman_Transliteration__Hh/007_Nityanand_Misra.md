That is one way to see it. The other perspective is that oral traditions have also become corrupt over ages. Please see the following documents by Ajit Krishnan for some examples -  
  
<http://www.aupasana.com/file-cabinet/VedicAccents2.pdf> (page 13 onwards)  
  
<http://www.aupasana.com/file-cabinet/yajusha_2012_07_26.pdf> (page 18)  
  
There was a discussion on this on the Samskrita mailing list sometime back - please refer the thread <https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/samskrita/nxTM2Hh5T6M>

And indeed the currently recited text has moved far away from what was recited during the time of Panini. ऋ pronounced as रि in North or रु in South, ष as ख in Yajurvedic tradition, ज्ञ as ग्य in North, ग्न in West and ज्न in South, accent over terminal consonant, shifting of accents (see Ajit Krishnan's examples) - all appear to be corruptions introduced over time.  
  
When Kahola goes wrong, Ashtavakra must correct. But Ashtavakra then also risks the dreaded curse of Kahola.
