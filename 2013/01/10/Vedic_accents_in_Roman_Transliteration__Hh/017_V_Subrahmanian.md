Dear Siva Senani and Ajit Krishnan,  
  
I can't agree more with you. This is exactly what the wise Sayanacharya has said at the beginning of his bhashya for the Mahanarayanopanishad that I cited in the other thread: *तत्तद्देशनिवासिभिः शिष्टैरादृतत्वात्सर्वोऽपि पाठ उपादेय एव* ।  
  
To this observation of Ajit:  
//does chanting the mantra according to the prAtishAkhya take one towards the mantra devatA more readily than chanting the mantra according to Sanskrit rules. //  
  
my response would be: If the adherent of any shAkhA/sampradAya considers the behavior of the adherent of another shAkhA/sampradAya to be wrong, there is this age-old word of wisdom:  
  
मूर्खो वदति विष्णाय बुधो वदति विष्णवे ।  
नम इत्येवं अर्थं च द्वयोरेव समं फलं ।।  
  
or its variant:  

    मूर्खो वदति विष्णाय बुधो वदति विष्णवे।
    उभयोः सदृशं पुण्यं भावग्राही जनार्दनः ॥

यस्मै दत्तं च यज्ज्ञानं ज्ञानदाता हरिः स्वयं ।  
ज्ञानेन तेन स स्तौति भावग्राही जनार्दनः ।। १२.४० ।।  
  
I am reminded of what Swami Vidyaranya has conveyed in the Jivanmuktiviveka, vAsanAkshayaprakaraNam: People of one region/caste/following criticize those of other region/caste/following for this or that wrong practice and in turn they are criticized by the others for their own incorrect or objectionable practice. This is due to the vAsanA that one alone is perfect and the others are not. This attitude is one of the things that hold one fast to samsara.
