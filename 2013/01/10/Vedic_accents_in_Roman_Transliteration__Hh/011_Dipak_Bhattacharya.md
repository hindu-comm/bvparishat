Dear Nityanandaji,

I am still in dark. I cannot relate your letter to any of the ones pasted here which only I had posted.

Still I am independently making some observations. The RkPratisaakhya clearly mentions that for the sake of meter one has to read with vyvāya (resolution of kṣaipra sandhi) and with vyūha (resolution of praśliṣṭa sandhis). Naturally one has to read *tát savitúr váreṇ_(i)ya**ṃ* for making an aṣṭākṣarī as demanded by Gāyatrī. For the same reason in 1.1.2b one has to read *īḷ_(i)yo nū́tanair utá*. What is wrong with these resolutions? The Vedas, it shows, had come into being with correct meter but the unstated hypothesis that sandhi is nitya in verse made a mutation in pronunciation giving rise to what we have received as Saṃhitāpāṭha. That the RkPrātikhya had to make rules for vyavāya and vyūha shows that the mutations had taken place before it and that for a critical edition we have no right to change the sāmpradāyika text. But that should not debar us from inferring how the ṣi had first pronounced the mantras. There is no reason to suppose that they recited metrically defective texts.

This matter had been discussed a few years ago here in this forum.

Best wishes

Dipak Bhattacharya

Dear Sundaresanji,

The Indian tradition may hail from the day of the introduction of the practice of writing the Vedas. But the said convention *ie* that of underlining the anudātta, perpendicular stroke on the svarita etc. was not the only way of showing accents in the manuscripts. In a Gujarati tradition the svarita syllable is scratched in red. In the Śāradā ms tradition the anudātta is dotted under, the udātta is stroked above, the svarita is stroked below and the pracaya is not marked. It has a special mark for the jātya-svarita. Marking in the pṛṣṭhamātrā-vowel tradition mss of the Deccan is different from both. The Black Yajurveda traditions are even different. I have some specimens meant for demonstration at lectures. But they will not be clear in the internet. One may find specimens of the ms-tradition of Black Yajurveda accent marks in Pandit Sātavalekar’s works.

The Western tradition of accent-marks is of Greco-Latin origin. These scripts go back to Semitic and, according to the majority view, ultimately to the Egyptian hieroglyphs.

Another point. Marking the udātta and jātyasvarita is sufficient for meaning. Also, if one remembers the rules of udāttapūrvasvarita and pracaya, marking them is not necessary.

I have a general question for Veda scholars here and would be grateful for pointers.



In Indian script publications, the convention is to depict anudAtta with a horizontal line below the syllable and svarita with a vertical line(s) above the syllable. How old is this convention? Is it something that has evolved within the recent past, thanks to the spread of the printed bookor is it something that was used in much older handwritten manuscripts as well?



Conversely, in academic publications, especially from Europe and America, Romanscript transliterations use only an accent over the udAtta syllable and leave both anudAtta and svarita unmarked. What was the origin of this convention? To me, at least, this style of transliteration makes it difficult to mentally relate the written text to the recited text, hence the question.

Regards, Vidyasankar

Dear Mr. Bhattacharya and Mr. Sundaresan,

I just want to know whether the Udātta accents and the Jātyasvarita accents are marked with the same symbol (´) in Roman transliteration.

I would be very much obliged if you care to enlighten me about this.



With regards, Deepro.
