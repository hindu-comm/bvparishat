The two-mark convention is fairly recent, and came much later than advent of printing in British India. Old manuscripts and printed works dating to nineteenth century show many more marks with significant variations.  
  
There a variations within different Vedas and also within Vedic manuscripts of the same Veda from different regions. E.g. in Shukla Yajurveda (Madhyandina recension) manuscripts, an independent svarita is represented by a small curve (कङ्कु) below the letter, while in Rigveda, it is marked by a curve above. In the Kashmiri and Junagadh manuscripts of Rigveda, Svarita is marked differently. This shows (as we already know) that the different conventions seen in manuscripts (and old printed texts) developed much later than the development of oral traditions.  
  
A comprehensive reference in this regard is Pandit Yudhishthira Mimamsaka's work in Hindi, वैदिक वाङ्मय में प्रयुक्त विविध स्वराङ्कन प्रकार (1964), published in Ajmer by Bharatiya Prachyavidya Pratishthana. Some notes from this work can be seen here - <http://sanskrit1.ccv.brown.edu/VedicUnicode/passages/PassagesYudhisthiraMimamsakaSvarV.pdf>

Regarding Western transliteration you may want to refer Charles Wikner's observations on page 3 of his note on Vedic Accents under <http://sanskritdocuments.org/all_pdf/accents.pdf> - The tradition of Western Sanskritists emphasizes grammar and translation .... it is unusual to find fully accented Saṁhitā text in transliteration, at best only the Udātta and Jātya Svarita are marked. India, on the other hand, has an oral tradition which emphasized pronunciation and rhythm, .....
