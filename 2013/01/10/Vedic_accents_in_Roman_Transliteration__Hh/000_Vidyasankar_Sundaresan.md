I have a general question for Veda scholars here and would be grateful for pointers.



In Indian script publications, the convention is to depict anudAtta with a horizontal line below the syllable and svarita with a vertical line(s) above the syllable. How old is this convention? Is it something that has evolved within the recent past, thanks to the spread of the printed bookor is it something that was used in much older handwritten manuscripts as well?



Conversely, in academic publications, especially from Europe and America, Romanscript transliterations use only an accent over the udAtta syllable and leave both anudAtta and svarita unmarked. What was the origin of this convention? To me, at least, this style of transliteration makes it difficult to mentally relate the written text to the recited text, hence the question.



Regards,

Vidyasankar
