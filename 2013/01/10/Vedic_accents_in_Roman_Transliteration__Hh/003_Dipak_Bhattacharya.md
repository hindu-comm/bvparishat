Dear Sundaresanji,

The Indian tradition may hail from the day of the introduction of the practice of writing the Vedas. But the said convention *ie* that of underlining the anudātta, perpendicular stroke on the svarita etc. was not the only way of showing accents in the manuscripts. In a Gujarati tradition the svarita syllable is scratched in red. In the Śāradā ms tradition the anudātta is dotted under, the udātta is stroked above, the svarita is stroked below and the pracaya is not marked. It has a special mark for the jātya-svarita. Marking in the pṛṣṭhamātrā-vowel tradition mss of the Deccan is different from both. The Black Yajurveda traditions are even different. I have some specimens meant for demonstration at lectures. But they will not be clear in the internet. One may find specimens of the ms-tradition of Black Yajurveda accent marks in Pandit Sātavalekar’s works.

The Western tradition of accent-marks is of Greco-Latin origin. These scripts go back to Semitic and, according to the majority view, ultimately to the Egyptian hieroglyphs.

Another point. Marking the udātta and jātyasvarita is sufficient for meaning. Also, if one remembers the rules of udāttapūrvasvarita and pracaya, marking them is not necessary.

Best
