Namaste,



The smritis codify current practices of their time, and particularly the good practices amongst them. IMO, they are not applicable to all deshas, kalas and patras ... though they are certainly the best indicator of good aachaara that we have.



If we look at the svaruupa of the veda mantras, each mantra has amantra drashta. We can even admit that the mantra drashta saw the mantra variously. That these variations in pronunciation occur systematically in the various shaakhaas can only lead to one conclusion ... the shaakhaas do not record the mantras as the mantra drashta saw them. The do not record the svaruupa of the mantra, but record the prayoga of the mantra. And, I can certainly accept differences in prayoga. But, this prayoga cannot be absolute.



Witha true shishta, I have no disagreement. The problem is the remainder of us, who pick and choose how to follow shishtas. Neither have we learnt the veda and it’s prayoga systematically, nor do we follow shishtas fully (due to the current state of our laukika lives). We are forced to make tradeoffs. Making the same tradeoffs that were made in older times may not be the best choice.



Using agni-kaarya as an example ... those who perform agni kaarya in big roaring fires (shishtas of old) don’t have to worry too much. Regardless of the ahutis and their quantities, it will all burn. Those who perform them in small tiny fires (non-shishta sadhakas of present) have to worry. The chances of the fire going out, or leaving everything unburntis much greater. Without a realized shishta guru looking over our shoulders, we are forced to think critically ... not because someone else is wrong, but simply because of the choices that we have already made.



IMO, the svaruupa of the mantra, as seen by the mantra drashtha, is more likely to be what is common amongst the praatishaakhyas (just my personal theory).



sasneham,



 ajit
