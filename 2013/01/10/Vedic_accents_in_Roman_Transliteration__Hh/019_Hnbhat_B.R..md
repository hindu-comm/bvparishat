To this observation of Ajit:

I have heard a variant of

  

"अज्ञो वदति" in the place of "मूर्खो वदति" in the above verse,

  

अज्ञ is differently considered from मूर्ख

  

अज्ञः सुखमाराध्यः सुखतरमाराध्यते विशेषज्ञः।

ज्ञानलवदुर्विदग्धं नरं न ब्रह्मापि न रञ्जयति॥

  

The third category is called मूर्ख as in the सुभाषित -

  

सर्वस्यौषधमस्ति शास्त्रविहितं मूर्खस्य नास्त्यौषधम्॥

  

The above thinking has lead a story of Valmiki, earlier a hunter, became ऋषि by chanting "maraa" taught by the sages, which resulted in the chanting of राम. SO being अज्ञ is by itself is not a fault, he could be taught the proper thing by some one. But not a मूर्ख.
