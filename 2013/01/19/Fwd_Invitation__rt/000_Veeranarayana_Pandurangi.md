**ABOUT THE SEMINAR**  

  

Samskriti Foundation ®, Mysore, is a Public Trust engaged in the activity of preservation and propagation of Cultural and Scientific Heritage of India. Over the last ten years of its existence, it has brought out several publications in the form of books, Audio CDs and Interactive Multimedia Computer CDs on various aspects of Indian cultural heritage, Manuscriptology and so on.

At present, with support from the National Mission for Manuscripts, IGNCA, Govt. of India, it is organizing a National Seminar on “**Application of Information Technology for conservation, editing and publication of Manuscripts” *on the 20^(th), 21^(st) and 22^(nd) of January 2013,*** **at Multivision Theatre, ISKCON, Harekrishna Hill, Rajajinagar, Bangalore.**

**About the seminar**

It is estimated that there are not less than about 1 million palm leaf / hand-made-paper manuscripts, that are the source works of the Indian Knowledge systems, in various manuscript repositories (both institutional and personal) in India alone.A survey was recently conducted by different agencies to know how many of these manuscripts have been published.It was surprising to know that only about 5% of these manuscripts have been published and only about 2% of these works in the form of manuscripts are readily available in print-form.Thus, it can be safely said that most of these works dealing with Indian knowledge systems are yet to see the light of the day.

It is well known that these manuscripts are written in different ancient scripts like Grantha, Sharada, Nandi-nagari, Tigalari and so on.People who know these scripts in India are very few.Thus there is every chance that we may permanently lose the treasure of knowledge that is enshrined in these ancient manuscripts.

Generally, one scholar who is an expert in the concerned script and subject can copy the text of about two or three manuscripts if he works continuously for one year.At this rate, we require about 16,000 man-years of expert scholars well-versed in the particular script and subject just to retrieve the information in these works, if it is done in the traditional manner.Thus it is humanly impossible to have all the manuscripts deciphered.

However, even in this bleak scenario, one need not lose heart.Since we are in the age of computers, it is possible to develop tools that can facilitate the retrieval of the texts of the manuscripts at a much faster pace.A comprehensive plan has to be envisaged for the application of Information Technology for the preservation, propagation, deciphering and ultimately publication of all the manuscripts available in the country. The current seminar proposes to assemble experts in information technology and manuscriptology to brainstorm and after due deliberations, evolve a comprehensive strategy for the application of Information Technology for each of the aspects concerning preservation, propagation, deciphering and ultimately publication of manuscripts.

Therefore it will be most useful to students, scholars, researchers and all other persons working in the field of manuscripts.

The Inaugural function of the seminar will be held at 10.30 AM on Sunday, the 20^(th) of January 2013. Dr. V Prakash, former Director and distinguished Scientist of CSIR-India will inaugurate the seminar. Sri Madhu Pandit Dasa, President of ISKCON, Bangalore will be the Chief Guest. Dr. S Sadagopan, Director, Indian Institute of Information Technology, Bangalore will deliver the key-note address. Prof ES Dwarakadasa, former Professor of Indian Institute of Science, will preside over the inaugural function.

The Valedictory function will be held at 5.00 PM on Tuesday, 22^(nd)
January. His Excellency Dr H R Bharadwaj, Honorable Governor of Karnataka will deliver the Valedictory address.

More than 40 scientists and manuscriptologists from all over India are participating in the seminar and presenting papers. Those who wish to participate may get in touch with the coordinator on 99001-61271 or send an email to [sams...@hotmail.com]().
