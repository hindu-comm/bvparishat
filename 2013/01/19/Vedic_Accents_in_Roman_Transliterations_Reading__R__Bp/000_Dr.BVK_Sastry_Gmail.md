Namaste



May I request the scholars here to clarify some primary issues in relation to these deliberations ?



**A) Scripting -Reading Convention for Sa-Swara Veda-Akshara**
(-Scripting and Transliteration intra Indian languages before Roman script and IPA notation deliberation) : What is the first available scripting convention document/ rule book for Sa-swara –Veda akshara ? If one is anchoring the debate to the 19^(th) century rule book from Kashi /Pune, we may need to have a relook at the issue. If the 1886 IPA standard of Europe is the anchor, then we may need a new thread to deliberate on pre-1700 C.E Indian script conventions – for each language and region, where manuscript was made. If we are talking of mediaeval period and Acharyas, then we need more data and documents. If we are talking of Pre-Current era period in relation to Patanjali /Pratishakhya /Shiksha Shastra , the voice tradition needs to be properly framed.



If the issue is narrowly framed to the last fifty years to current period \< Vedas pronounced –taught on the foundation of regional dialects, which cause the \< varna-Vikruti / Pada-prakruti dushtatva / Pathya karma related local variations and practice related deformations>, then the referencing point needs to be totally redefined.



**Reason for this question**: The scripts of india has evolved over a period of time. The current devanagari script, as a reference anchor has a historic date, far later than the texts explaining the voice variations, as in veda-pathas and pratishakhya works. The ‘andhra /dramida’ pathas indicated by Acharyas most likely refer to the voice rendering / shakha bheda et al. Without a clarity on the warning \< tathaa likhita-paathakah> in Vyakarana , and clarity on \< dushtah shabdah, swarato varnato vaa> , efforts to analyze –critique –rule justify a variation would not be correct. If there is a corruption of oral tradition , let it be accepted. On the point of theorizing, the key to clinch the debate is :Can the rule base be illustrated by vocing it ? A simple test :Ask for a proper pronunciation of eighteen varieties of ‘ a’ –kaara before asking for all the nuances of kampa, ghaata in Sama veda. The system of VEDANGA foundational training before VEDA-PATHA is a ALMOST EXTINCT REMINISCENT tradition in India, with LIP-SYMPATHY and THEORIZING – ( I stand to be corrected on this statement ). The last I heard of such reference to this tradition is in the DASHAGRANTHI Parayana system, where the Samhita text is used ( sans swaras; for reasons of Swadhyaya / at best traiswarya. And Upaamshu mode. )



**About IPA Standards** : The IPA is the major as well as the oldest representative organisation for phoneticians. It was established in 1886 in Paris. 2011 marked the 125th anniversary of the founding of the IPA. The aim of the IPA is to promote the scientific study of phonetics and the various practical applications of that science. In furtherance of this aim, the IPA provides the academic community world-wide with a notational standard for the phonetic representation of all languages - the [International Phonetic Alphabet](http://www.langsci.ucl.ac.uk/ipa/ipachart.html) (also IPA). The latest version of the IPA Alphabet was published in 2005.



**B) Mantra –Devataa : **The answer is YES for this question \< The question that most interests me is this -- does chanting the mantra according to the prAtishAkhya take one towards the mantra devatA more readily than chanting the mantra according to Sanskrit rules. Unfortunately, no amount of textual analysis can provide the answer.
\> The guidance comes from Mantra-Viniyoga /Prana Pratishtaa – Vedanga Vyakarana - VakYoga traditions. It is not a part of the historical linguistics – indological studies model of Sanskrit.



**C) Deviation in the Chandas ?? Narayana Sukta ? **If some one is making a ‘ bad pronunciation’ just say that it is ‘ bad’. There is no need to hold a fig leaf of shaakhaa bheda, shastrantra, rule variation, et al ? IF one TRULY believes that VEDA MANTRA is a ‘ SHRUTI-DARSHANA’, how can you raise the variant pronunciation deliberation ? Either you accept that ‘ text with erroris a ‘
Shruti-Darshana’ -

OR say ‘ The chanting is Apa-Shruti /Apa-Shabda’. Why navigation to fit the maatraa in to chandas rule base ? Where is it ruled that ‘ Vedanga Chandas’ regulates the ‘Darshana’ ? The rule of Chandas –works is useful in yajnika vidhi and viniyoga. The rule book does NOT regulate Darshana.



The follow up point will then be : Is the given mantra original darshana ( like the Vishwamitra Gayatri) or a Derived / Ooha gayatri ( like the twenty plus seen in Mahanaryaana Upanishat?) Mantra ? Certainly the Chandas rule is needed for Ooha –viniyoga. But does this restrict Darshana also to be humanly corrected to fit in to the rule base ?



If the traditionalist prefers to go this way, what then is the
difference between your thinking to tinker shruti-darshana /apaursheya
and colonial academia bringing out the ‘ Corrected VEDA’ as a ‘ rule conforming text’ ?? Where is it said that Mantra related ‘ Chaandasa’ - Anushtup must follow the classical Bhashaa – anushtup in kaavya ? Are you likely to correct all the mantras in purusha sukta to tailor fit the aushtup lakshana from pingala or kedarabhatta ? When did statistical probability become an yard stick for correction of Veda-Mantra ? When did Vedanta teams start meddling with Veda-Mantra –Chandas to suit their preferred line of thinking ?



Thanks in advance for the clarifications.

Dear Sri Misra,  
  
I wanted to put the following on record before I forgot about it. Regarding pronunciation of सहस्रशीर्षा as सहस्रशीरषा or वर्षमिषवस्तेभ्यो as वरुषमिषवस्तेभ्यो -   
There is a taittirIya prAtiSAkhya rule that there is a svarabhakti in the conjunction of repha and UshmANa-s. What is heard as if it is a र or a रु before the sha-kAra is nothing but a reciter's attempt at svarabhakti. I have even seen written notation where the symbol ऋ has been used, e.g. सहस्रशीऋषा, to depict this svarabhakti. Similarly, the word maharshi, in the Veda, it is pronounced as if there is a ऋ sound in there and not as a conjunct consonant involving the repha and an UshmANa. This goes directly counter to the classical vyAkaraNa rule for this word. Now, as for ideal  
vs. actual pronunciation of ऋ, that is a different matter. In whichever manner a reciter pronounces ऋ, it is in that manner that he renders svarabhakti in rephoshma conjunction.  
  
All the other instances cited from the aupasana website, e.g. िपन्व॑न्न॒जरं॑ सु॒वीरम् vs. िपन्व॑न्न॒जर सु॒वीरम्, etc, pertain to a difference in approach in how to pronounce the anusvAra. They are contingent upon whether to take the anusvAra as a separate vowel that takes its own svarita or whether the svarita applies to the sound preceding the anusvAra. There is a taittirIya prAtiSAkhya rule that counts anusvAra as a hrasva vowel, indicating that rendering an anusvAra independently requires a time mAtra equal to that of any other hrasva vowel. Also, in taittirIya recitation,  
before repha and UshmANa, the anusvAra retains a glottal component to it, which actually does make it a hrasva sound separate from its preceding akshara. This glottal component is lost when sandhi converts anusvAra to an anunAsika as per the varga of the following consonant and then the whole sound becomes a conjunct consonant, losing its separate time mAtra. And as  
with the time required to render it, so also with whether the svarita is applied to it separately or not. This glottal feature of the anusvAra is not present in the Rk SAkhA recitations and conseuquently, in what I have heard of the Rgveda, the anusvAra never gets its own svarita. Similar considerations apply to sentence ending -n and to svarabhakti. The problem,  
if any, is one of how to capture these features consistently in writing. It is not a problem in recitation or in vedAdhyayana per se, so long as adhyApaka and adhyAyI are both careful.  
  
  
The other problem highlighted in the [aupasana.com](http://aupasana.com) site, namely the mixing up of dIrgha svarita and glottal anusvAra specialities from Rg and yajus traditions, within one verse, is indeed one of faulty reciters. Again however, these issues affect the amateur and partial adhyAyIs much more than dedicated reciters of the vedas. These usually affect only the recitation of a handful of Rk verses that are not already in the yajurveda, but have been borrowed by yajurvedins for pUjA and pArAyaNa purposes. And nowadays, many people recite the popular sUktas, the namaka-camaka and other sundry veda verses, without proper training. In my experience, the collective drag inflicted by a host of mispronunciations and misapplied svara-s can be heavy even on seasoned and well-trained reciters. However, these stray instances cannot be laid at the doors of all the oral transmission traditions.  
  
Regards,  
Vidyasankar

namaste,  
  
\> There is a taittirIya prAtiSAkhya rule that counts anusvAra as a hrasva vowel Ultimately, the crux of this thread is whether or not the prAtishAkhya is accepted as pramANa or not. If I am honest with myself, some renderings in some shAkhAs just seem "wrong" ... purukhaH in place of puruShaH, pracodayAl in place of pracodayAt, etc. But ...   
\> That is one way to see it. The other perspective is that oral traditions have also become corrupt over ages.  
  
Can we really distinguish just the corruptions from the originals. Though we can theorize, the answer is a resounding "no". There isn't going to be any major reform of the chanting tradition, nor should there be. Some people may choose to attempt "reformed" chanting methods, but these will be sideshows that live in the shadows of the tradition proper. In fact, they will only survive because of the grace of the tradition itself.  
  
The question that most interests me is this -- does chanting the mantra according to the prAtishAkhya take one towards the mantra devatA more readily than chanting the mantra according to Sanskrit rules. Unfortunately, no amount of textual analysis can provide the answer.

Dear Scholars,  
  
How does one technically explain the deviation in the Chhandas with "स हरिः"? Are there any other such known departures from the Chhandas in other  
rks?

In certain metrical formation the number of syllables are counted in each of their foot. In some cases the number of metrical unit of length (in the case of vowels) or weight in conjunction (in the case of consonants) is called मात्रा also counted in each foot. We take anustubh for instance which has the unique feature of having eight syllables each intact in all the four feet of the verse. The Mahabharata, the Ramayana and the Puranas give most number of anushtubhs.  
  
Now, we see with स हरिः and without in those Upanisadic statements. Professor Bhattacharya had given an example in this thread: स ब्रह्म स शिवः सेन्द्रः (8 syllables)   
सोऽक्षरः परमः स्वराट्। (8 syllables) इत्यनुष्टुप्। Now let us examine the other version (irrespective whether ब्रह्म or ब्रह्मा, no harm) with स हरिः स ब्रह्मा स शिवः स हरिः सेन्द्रः(11 syllables)   
सोऽक्षरःपरमः स्वराट्। (8 syllables) So the criterion of 8 syllable homogeneity has been tampered here with 11 syllables in the first feet harms the anushtubh. Why we tend for an anushtubh? We see the rest two feet too: स एव विष्णुः स प्राणः (8 syllables) स कालोऽग्निः स चन्द्रमाः।।(8 syllables) where such homogeneity has been maintained, to assume an anushtubh.   
Moreover, apart from the Upanisad, let us check an anushtubh in a Samhitaa: यमाय घृतवद्धवि-(8 syllables) र्जुहोत प्र च तिष्ठत। (8 syllables) स नो देवेष्वायम- (8 syllables) द्दीर्घमायुः प्र जीवसे ॥१४॥ (8 syllables) (ऋ.वे.सं.१०.१४.१४**) Here we see the pattern is intact. So the criterion match well enough to be called an anushtubh. This is how such metric works.**  
  
Then, if you like स हरिः there in the same foot, you have justify the **metre in some other way but 75% of the mantra trend of an anushtubh works against an inclusion of स हरिः** there.
