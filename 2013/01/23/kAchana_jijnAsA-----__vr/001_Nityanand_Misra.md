Do not remember where, but I read sometime back that Uddhava suffered from rheumatism/gout. Hence the name पवनव्याधिः for him is famous. पवनात् व्याधिर्यस्य सः पवनव्याधिः - बहुव्रीहि. The name is used in माघ's शिशिपालवधम् (2/15). The reference to the disease may be in the Srimadbhagavatam.  
  
Ailments of the bones are believed to be caused by वात. The Valmiki Ramayana has a narration where वायुदेव enters the bodies of maiden princesses and makes them crooked when they turn his proposal down.
