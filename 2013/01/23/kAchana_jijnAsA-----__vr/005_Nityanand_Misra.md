Rupagosvamin's usage may not be related with the Puranic source of the name, but Jivagosvamin's commentary on the verse may have an explanation of the epithet which may lead us to the original source. I have not seen Jivagosvamin's commentary.

Agree, the exact reference is still elusive and this verse is the generic verse is the closest hint I found in the स्यमन्तकमणि episode in SB.  
  
It may be worthwhile to explore usages of the name before Magha (7th century BC). आचार्य चाणक्य, who preceded Magha by 1000 years, has mentioned वातव्याधि (वात=पवन) as a पूर्वाचार्य of अर्थशास्त्र and has quoted him several times in अर्थशास्त्रम्. E.g. "नेति वातव्याधिः" (१-८-२०), "द्वैगुण्यमिति वातव्याधिः" (७-१-३), "दण्डमित्रव्यसनयोर्मित्रव्यसनमिति वातव्याधिः" (८-१-५३). Commentaries on अर्थशास्त्रम् have interpreted वातव्याधि as उद्धव. In the book, *Considerations on some aspects of ancient Indian polity* (1916), Rangaswamy Aiyangar says on page 120 (italics mine)  
  
"Vatavyadhi, the name of one of the previous writers referred to by Kautilya, *is also one of the names of Uddhava*, the friend and relation of Krishna, *according to the Puranas*. He is there spoken of as an adept in policy and administration, and this view has been accepted by the poet Magha, who in his Sisupalavadha, makes him a minister of Krishna."

From the commas, it appears that "according to the Puranas" is qualifying the clause "is also one of the names of Uddhava". The Puranic references are missing though.
