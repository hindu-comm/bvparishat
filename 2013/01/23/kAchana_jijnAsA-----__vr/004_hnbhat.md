I don't think Jeevagosvami's statement has anything to do with the source. The statement itself shows it was not factual, as he describes "his impatience turning out a fresh desease" his worry on delay of return of Krishna, who went after Syamantakamani, making his name true to his name.

  

The Bhagavata quotation also seems to be contextual and not anything specific to Uddhava as it appears, describing the bad omens.

  

  

On referring to the commentaries, we can be certain. I will refer to the above context in Bhagavata, in the commentaries and feed back about its context quoted.
