Dear Shri. Krishnamurthi ,

Srinivasan Ramanujan's some of the contributions to the mathematics are including the theta functions, trigonometric functions such as sine and cosine and super-symmetric (Möebius transformation (यथातथपरिवर्तनम्) is applied to the functions). The "Magic Square" with his birth date: 22-12-1887 is interesting. The trick which appears in the 16 column with as many possible square of four columns with added number values make 139 (Ramanujan's date of birth addition: 22 + 12 + 18 + 87 = 139). The three other numbers are more or less close to these four numbers involved in addition to have 139.

The “Positive Cubes” story of Ramanujan Number with the dot cab number 1729 = 1³ + 12³ = 9³ + 10³ is also popular. What the symmetric functions, paradigms of grammar, phonetics and metre are to be expected like mathematical functions? Do you mean यथासंख्यम् (as asymmetry in some cases of substitutes and substituents) like rules are to be interpreted as the symmetry? How could the basic unit of sound go below the matra concept (as matra concept is equal in metres with phonetics)? Shiksha recommends the different duration of utterances as that of चाषः, वायसः, शिखी and नकुलः. It may be convenient if you may please explain about what you have already said: “the deeper aspects of basic unit of sound, phonemes and their mathematics and cognition.”

Regards,

Narayanan
