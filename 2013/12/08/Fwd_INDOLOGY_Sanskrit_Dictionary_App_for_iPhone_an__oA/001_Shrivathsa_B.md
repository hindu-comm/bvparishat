hariH OM,  
  
 I don't know why the stardict suporting dictionary apps available in the app store are not good (why can't apple have a good free app which can support stardict dictionaries?). I tried various versions of stardict format supporting apps but couldn't find one which actually works (the ones which worked were not rendering fonts properly or were truncating entries. i.e. not showing entries fully).  
  
 In android, the colordict app is simple, easy to use and blazing fast. Unfortunately it is not available in itunes (unless you wish to jailbreak etc. which i am not thinking of). Spent about 4 days searching for a good dictionary app on istore, trying to put the stardict dictionaries i have (from aupasana) into some other formats and finally gave up. Android seems more user friendly when it comes to bhAratiiya content. I have been using colordict for the past 2 yrs and it works really good. my wish to see it on a bigger screen (ipad) was futile.  

  

svasti,  

 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,  

 shrivathsa.
