Respected all,

I wanted to embark upon the edition of the abovementioned work.

I wanted to check whether this book is published or not, to avoid duplication.

I checked the catalogues of the places where these manuscripts are available, but couldnt get details about the publication.

  

I would request the scholars if anyone has come across publication of this book ?

  

Book name - उपसर्गमण्डनः

Author name - मण्डनमन्त्री / मण्डनकवि

Additional information available -

He is related to one बाहड.

He tells that this upasargamaNDana is a skandha of his work known as kavikalpadruma.

  

So far I have been able to locate three manuscripts

6802,6803 and 9489 from Hemacandracarya jain granth bhandara patan.

  

Any additional manuscript detail will be highly appreciated.
