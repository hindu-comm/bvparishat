Congratulations.  
This course will give new opportunities to Sanskrit students. But why only 8 seats?  
  
This diploma must start in sanskrit universities also. Huge number of students and teachers will join this course . Or there must be a optional paper of sanskrit computational linguistics in Acharya course. There are many scholars in JNU (Delhi) doing research in this field, they can teach . In Rastriya Sanskrit Sansthan.aIllahabad campus Dr. Lalit Kumar Tripathi is a pioneer person in this field. In Sansthan this course can run easily.
