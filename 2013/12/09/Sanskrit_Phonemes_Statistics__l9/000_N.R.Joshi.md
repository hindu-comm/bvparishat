Respected Scholars Namaskar !

I like the way Russian scholarMG doing his research in various aspects of Sanskrit. If we look into the dictionary of V.S.Apte, we find no of words involving Moordhanya VarNas (Phonemes) are small in number. The same is true for the second dental phoneme (th). I would like to know is there any research within India or outside about frequency of occurrences of certain phonemes in a given Sanskrit book on either philosophy or religion or science. This has in my opinion bearing on semantics of Sanskrit words. Let us not forget that VarNavaada versus Sphotavaada occupies important place in Sanskrit linguistic philosophy. Thanks. N.R.Joshi
