Yes, this is a well known fact indeed. And easy countable, as we have an OCR text of Apte's Dictionary.

This is an unexplored field in the West as well as regards of Sanskrit. There are no good books on Sanskrit semantics from India lately anyway, or am I wrong?

  

Anything is countable. And I want to prove it in my reverse Sanskrit dictionary for the first time in this field,
