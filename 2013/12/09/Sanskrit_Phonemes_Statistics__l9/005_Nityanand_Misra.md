Dr. Amba Kulkarni Ji

  

Many thanks for this information.

  

I know of many papers which have delved on the computational aspects (e.g. context-sensitive grammar, word generation and parsing, etc) of Panini.

  

I have not come across any that see Paninian grammar as a statistical model to explain variation with the pre-Paninian "Sadhu Prayogas" being observed in-sample data, the different Ganas being categorical variables, the rules being the link functions, and the new Prayogas being out-sample data which we classify as Paninian or non-Paninian based on the prediction of the statistical model. Do you know of any such papers?

  

As is said, there are two eyes of व्याकरण - प्रक्रिया and दर्शन. Statistics - is strikingly similar - having elements of both math and philosophy.

  

Regards, Nityanand
