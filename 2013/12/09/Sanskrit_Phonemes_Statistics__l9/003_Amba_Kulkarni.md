Corpus linguistics, which uses the real corpus for the study of linguistic phenomenon is a part of computational linguistics.  

You will find relevant submissions in Computational Linguistics related conferences and journals.  
  

Dr. Tirumala Kulkarni has studied the corpus of Vedanta texts using various online tools to arrive at a 'core grammar' that is sufficient to start reading and understanding any Vedanta texts. He presented his findings in the 5th Sanskrit Computational Linguistics Symposium held at IIT Mumbai in Jan 2013.  
  

With regards,  
Amba Kulkarni
