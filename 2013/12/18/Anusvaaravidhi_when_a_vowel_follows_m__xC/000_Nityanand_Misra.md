Namaste

  

Is there any possibility of terminal म् (specifically, that of the आम् Vibhakti) changing to अनुस्वार when it is followed by a vowel (अच्)? I saw this in a publication, but from my limited knowledge of Prakriya, this is not possible.

  

From what I know, Anusvaara can only result from the following Sutras

8-3-4 अनुनासिकात्‌परोऽनुस्वारः

8-3-23 मोऽनुस्वारः \[हलि\]

8-3-24 नश्चापदान्तस्य झलि

  

None of these apply when a vowel follows. Is there any obscure Vaarttika or Paribhasha that allows this?

  

Any pointers would be much appreciated.
