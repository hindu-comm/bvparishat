Respected scholars,  

Sanskrit Academy has undertaken a work on grammar which requires symbols for जिह्वामूलीय उपध्मानीय semi circular shaped ones. I Searched but couldn't find those two symbols indicating the above two grammatical symbols.  

pl. guide me how to insert them while doing DTP work .  

with regards
