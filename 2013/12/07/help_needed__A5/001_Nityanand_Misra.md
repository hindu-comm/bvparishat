What font are you using? If a Unicode font then you need a font that supports the Vedic Extensions block (1CD0 to 1CFF).  
  
Refer  
<http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U1CD0.pdf>  
and  
<http://www.alanwood.net/unicode/vedic-extensions.html>  
  
There are Unicode symbols for both Jihvamuliya and Upadhmaniya (U+1CF5 and U+1CF6). To enter them you would type "1CF5" or "1CF6" and then Alt-x in MS Word. The problem is that the glyph is absent for these two codes in most Unicode compatible Devanagari fonts including Arial Unicode MS, Chandas, or Sanskrit 2003. As Vedic Extensions were first included in the Unicode Standard in 2009, the fonts that came before 2009 are not likely to support them.  
  
There is one font which supports most of the extensions - Siddhanta. But even this does not support Jihvamuliya and Upadhmaniya.  
  
However, necessity being the mother of invention, it might be best for you to add the glyphs to your choice of font yourself. It is very easy to add two glyphs to an existing font. I use Type Light and Font Forge to add new glyphs or change glyphs in fonts.  
  
If you let me know what font you plan to use, I can help further.  
  
Thanks, Nityanand
