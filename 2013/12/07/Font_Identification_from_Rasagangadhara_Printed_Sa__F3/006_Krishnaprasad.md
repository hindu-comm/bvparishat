Once again thanks for giving most useful information. Now I understood like this. I shall use XeLaTeX for typesetting and editing, and finally I am going to convert it to any of the APS DV fonts.? (Because for typesetting in XeLaTeX is easier and fonts from APS DV are beautiful). If I have mistaken something please suggest me. And I hope I am not giving hassle to you. And I hope to convert to APS DV fonts I need extra software.
