Dear Misraji,

  

Apologies for opening up this old thread. Have you in this or any other thread given a basic guide to typeset Sanskrit in XeLaTex? There is no online resource that quite helps with this and it would be great if you can point me in the right direction.

  

In case, you have not made the basic guideyet, would you consider making one? It would save a world of pain for noobs like me.

  

Can you also share in this your tips on how to include the Vedic accents along with devanagari within XeLaTex?

  

Kind Regards,

  

Venkat
