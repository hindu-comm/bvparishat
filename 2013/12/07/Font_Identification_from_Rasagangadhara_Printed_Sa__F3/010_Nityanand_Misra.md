The Chanakya font is developed by the company Summit Information Technology Pvt Ltd based in Gurgao. Their website is under<http://summitindia.com/>Their client list is quite impressive and includes Gita Press Gorakhpur, which I know for a fact uses the original Chanakya font. Take a look at this book from Gita Press -

The Walkman Chanakya Series was developed by the company "Walkman Software Engineers" which was once based at149, Anand Nagar, Inderlok, Delhi 110035. It has either moved or wound up, as my Google search did not show up the company name at that address anymore.

  

You can take a look at the Śrīgītātātparya PDF I posted on this forum to get an idea of how typesetting with Sanskrit 2003 on XeLaTeX would look like. I am currently typesetting a document in XeLaTeX with more than 1,600 glyphs in 12 different forms including APS DV and Walkman Chanakya. I will share the same when done - then you can see which font appeals the most to you.

  

Meanwhile here is a book typeset in APS DV Stardust font using Page Maker

<http://jagadgururambhadracharya.org/pdfs/JR2011Gitaramayanam.pdf>  

As you would see APS DV is not as great as Sanskrit 2003, but is "good enough" and at least has a bold and normal version.
