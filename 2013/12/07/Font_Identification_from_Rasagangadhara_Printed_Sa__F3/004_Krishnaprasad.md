Misra ji  
Thanks a lot for your reply, I did couple of google searches yesterday and I found this link, <http://vsoftsolutions.in/site/products/aps-designer-6/>  
there, in the list of fetures, they say unicode compliant, but unfortunately I don't know what is unicode compliant. I am typesetting and authoring the book.  
Your reply helped me a lot. I will private email if I have any doubts.
