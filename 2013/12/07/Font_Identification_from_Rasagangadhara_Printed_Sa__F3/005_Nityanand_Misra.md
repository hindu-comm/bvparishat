I have not tried the APS designer, I typeset books in XeLaTeX.Two of themare to be released soon, one in the next few days, and you can see if you like the typeset. LaTeX gives you full control of the typsetting process and though has a steep learning curve, is better than any other typesetting software that I know of.



The APS DV font series(Prakash, Priyanka, Stardust, etc) is certainly not Unicode compliant as far as I know.



In a Unicode-compliant font, the single character "क" or the Unicode value U+0915 ('DEVANAGARI LETTER KA' in the Unicode standard)is displayed as "क", with the glyph design different depending on the font (Mangal, Arial Unicode MS, Sanskrit 2003, Siddhanta, etc). Since the internal representation of the font corresponds to the Unicode Standard, the font is called Unicode-compliant. To convert from one font to another, you only need to select text and change the font.



In the APS DV font series, three characters"keâ" or the Unicode values U+006B U+0065 U+00E2 ('LATIN SMALL LETTER K' + 'LATIN SMALL LETTER E' + 'LATIN SMALL LETTER A WITH CIRCUMFLEX' ) occuring in that order are displayed as "क", with the glyph designs different for Prakash, Priyanka, Stardust. The first letter "k" produces the left part of the output, the second letter "e" produces the vertial danda, and the third letter "â" produces the right hook. The internal representation of the font does not correspond to Unicode standard.
