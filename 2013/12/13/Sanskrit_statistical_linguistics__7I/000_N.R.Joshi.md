Dr. Nityananda Mishra wrote "Maybe we need a conference series on "Sanskrit Statistical Linguistics". This is very good idea. It will open new doors of research for unexplored features of Sanskrit. In 1983 I got permission from my friend (Linguistic Scholar in USA) to attend conference on Sanskrit and Linguistics in Syracuse University. In that conference one scholar presented paper on Statistical analysis of syllables.

Thanks Nityanandaji for your posting. It will certainly help in my research on VarNavaada.
