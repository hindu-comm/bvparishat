Sanskrit 2003 is the bold version of Nirnaya. Make a light one, that way you will have best ligatures and really Indian experience. For the next edition of the book, as it might take up to 3 years of work as if compared to Siddhanta. Mihas proposed 1-3 months of work and it turned out to be 3 years of slavish work.

 If "This book uses an adaptation of the Sanskrit 2003 TrueType" is written in Time, do not do it. Rather go for <http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=charissilfont>

Yes, anything else will work. But never use bullets in a Sanskrit book. Looks like a .doc made by a 8 year old child.

And please add [Sanskrit hyphenation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ktm-rMjZnOGFdwN7u7gE1WzkhohPcPMQA3XrRSvn56o/edit#). TeX has ready solutions to make the book a typographical gem as well.

Saw it.

So the name should be something like Sanskrit 2013, as per the tradition anyway, I guess.

Enlisting them on a google doc would be a good idea. I'm aware of several such modifications of Sanskrit 2003.

Nirnaya is a great typography (was), so it just had to be.
