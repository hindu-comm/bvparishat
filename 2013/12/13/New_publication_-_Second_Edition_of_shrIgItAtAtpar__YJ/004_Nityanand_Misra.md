Sorry for reviving a 10 month old thread. I realized today that Sanskrit 2003 is not the bold version of Nirnaya, rather it is the light version of Nirnaya. See the image below.  
  
What is needed is to create a boldface and normal versions of the NSP. And a new font, not combing with Sanskrit 2003.  
  
The NSP font is from the scan of page 7 of Nirnay Sagar Press' Kavyamala Series 84 (Stavamala of Rupa Gosvami), 1903.  
  
Line 1: Bold and light versions of word चरित्र in NSP font.  
  
Line 2: Bold version of word चरित्र in the NSP font, and चरित्र in Sanskrit 2003 font.  
  
Line 3: Autofakebolding of चरित्र in Sanskrit 2003 font by MS Word, and bold version of word चरित्र in the NSP font.
