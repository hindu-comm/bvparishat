Bullets are used at four places in the book, all in the first chapter. I am not a big fan of bullets either, but **itemize** in LaTeX does have bullet as the default. Maybe I should switch to **enumerate** or use a different symbol instead of bullets. Will change this later.

I have added the font details. See attached updated PDF - the document under the URL is also updated.  
  
I had not included this earlier since the font I am using does not have a name yet. I have made changes to the Sanskrit 2003 fonts to render the Hindi consonants ड़ and ढ़ with the "Nukta" (dot) below the glyphs and accordingly changed the position of the ु and ू Matras for these two. I want to make some other changes, e.g. the font does not render रिं properly (the Anusvaara is over the Matra glyph), the comma and English letters are not good (so one needs to switch fonts to include something in English), etc.  
  
Sanskrit 2003 is no doubt a great font, but it has several shortcomings which I discovered while editing the font - more on this some other day.
