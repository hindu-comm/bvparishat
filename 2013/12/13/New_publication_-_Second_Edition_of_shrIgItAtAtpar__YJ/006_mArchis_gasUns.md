Mihail said it's the bold one. He knows every letter by heart, so it's hard to argue with him. His font has the most ligatures, he knows all of it there is to be known about devanagari font design for Sanskrit grammar texts.

One needs to know VOLT to make a remake of NSP. The only guy I'm aware of is the author of Siddhanta and it took him three years to make it. He said never again, when I asked him to make a bold edition of the same font. So asking here does not makes sense. There are only a few people from India whom I know who could make it<https://www.facebook.com/mukund.gokhale1><https://www.facebook.com/kulkarni.sarang><https://www.facebook.com/yashodeep.gholap> Yashodeep wanted to finish<http://www.yashodeepgholap.com/portfolio/jaini/> this year.
