Respected Scholars, Namaskar!

Is there any difference in meanings of the two words--ApamAna and AvamAna? Dictionary says both mean disrespect.

Also the word Kansa \[ ( ) like this\] means a cup or goblet. But sometimes it is used as a parenthesis ( ) to enclosed words. Is that meaning of Kansa correct or is it just roodhi ? Please help. Thanks. N.R.Joshi
