sir

thediffrence is avamana is -------not giving due respect to the exalted(
)

  

apamana is Insult,insinuation etc. cf.For exI) in Raghuvamsa 1 Canto--- प्रतिबध्नाति हिश्रेयःपूज्यपूजा व्यतिक्रमः


-----------------------------

ii) सुखमवमतः शेते------ मनुo 2nd chapter. hence I think there is a shadediff . avamana is not showing respect where it due
APamaan is showing disrespect by insulting behaviour.
