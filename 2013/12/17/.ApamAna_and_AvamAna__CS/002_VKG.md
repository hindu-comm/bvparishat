मा माने पूजायां धातुः, ल्युट् - प्रत्ययः.

Ava connotes Lower.

Apa connotes Away.

  

If the presitge or honour is lowered Avamaana

or

it is taken away it is Apamaana. Either way, it the loss of Honour.

------

Kamsa is the word used in the context of a container in Veda. (Athaasmai SuraaKamsam Hasta Aadadhaati - Aitareya Braahmanam).

The parenthesis contains a subset. Since, it is also a container in literary sense, people have started to use Kamsa for bracket.

  

We cannot find an ancient reference for a modern punctuation mark or its perceived equivalent/
