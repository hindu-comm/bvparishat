Namaste,

  

What do the double letters in Wilson mean? Most of them occur after "r", what is the logic behind them?

Same words occur with onle 1 letter instead of 2 letters in other Sanskrit dictionaries.

Compare **hiMsAkarmman**

<http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/WILScan/disp3/index.php>

and **hiMsAkarman** <http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/PWScan/disp2/index.php>

  

Sample list (whole list in the .xls file)

-   barbbaṭa  
-   śrīgarbbha  
-   nagamūrddhan  
-   carmmāvanaddha  
-   gucchārddha  
-   chinnanāsika  
-   jīrṇṇaparṇṇa  
-   amūrtta  
-   aṅkaparivarttana  
-   pārvvaṇa  
-   animiṣācāryya  
-   kṣattriyaprāya

Need advice how to treat them. Should I leave them as they are? But that would mean that in my 250 000

Sanskrit word list 2500 pseudo words would appear. What do you think about such orthographic variants?
