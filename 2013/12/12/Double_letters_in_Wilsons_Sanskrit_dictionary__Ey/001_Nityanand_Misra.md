Most of them where the duplication is after "r" are spelling variants where the consonant following "r" is optionally duplicated by the rule **PS 8.4.46 aco rahābhyāṁ dve** of the Aṣṭādhyāyī. So both "dharma" and "dharmma" are correct. Sanskrit inscriptions, older manuscripts and some 19th century printed books use the variation with duplication. In contrast, Prakrit inscriptions (like those of Emperor Asoka) use the variation without duplication. In all such cases you can safely use the spelling without the duplication.

  

However, caveat lector! In some cases the spelling with the duplication is the only correct spelling. Some examples that come to mind are

  

1\. "tottra" (a whip or goad for a horse or elephant) is correct, "totra" is wrong.

2\. "tattva" (essense/substance) is correct, "tatva" is wrong

3\. "kṣattra" (dominion/the warrior race) is correct, "kṣatra" is wrong

3\. "kṣattriya" (the warrior race) is correct, kṣatriya" is wrong

  

In these examples, the derivation does not have optional duplication rather it the result of two instances of the same consonant coming together and the lack of application of**PS 8-4-65****jharo jhari savarṇe**due the conditions of 8-4-65 not being satisfied.

  

For instance see the Prakriya of the wordkṣattra

  

kṣaṇ + kvip = kṣat = nāśa meaning destruction

One who protects from destruction or kṣat is kṣattra.

  

kṣaṇ -> **sampadādibh‍yaḥ kvip** (Vārttika on 3-3-94) -> kṣan kvip ->**upadeśe'janunāsika it** (1-3-2), **halantyam** (1-3-3), **laśakvataddhite** (1-3-8), **tasya lopaḥ** (1-3-9) ->anubandhalopa -> sarvāpahāralopa -> kṣaṇ -> **gamādīnāmiti vaktavyam** (Vārttikaon6-4-40) -> kṣa -> **hrasvasya piti kṛti tuk** (6-1-71) -> kṣa tuk ->**upadeśe'janunāsika it**(1-3-2),**halantyam**(1-3-3),**tasya lopaḥ**(1-3-9) ->anubandhalopa -> kṣa t -> kṣat

  

kṣatāt trāyate iti kṣattraḥ

**ātaścopasarge** (3-3-136) -> kṣat ṅasi trā ka -> **laśakvataddhite** (1-3-8), **tasya lopaḥ** (1-3-9) ->anubandhalopa ->kṣat ṅasi trā a -> **āto lopa iṭi ca** (6-4-64) -> kṣat ṅasi tr a -> kṣat ṅasi tra -> **kṛttaddhitasamāsāśca** (1-2-46) -> **supo dhātuprātipadikayoḥ** (2-4-71) -> kṣat tra -> kṣattra -> declension as nominative singular masculine -> kṣattraḥ

  

Here the form kṣattra (with two 't's) is the only correct form and kṣatra (with single 't') is wrong, since here the rule **jharo jhari savarṇe** (8-4-65) does not apply here.
