OK. I see the point. But, in that case what we are saying is this: Most (actually all) published editions of the Vedas and even of other scriptures like the Upanishads, Gita, Nighantu etc. are wrong, because the single "t" version of the two words in grammatically not possible. This I think is highly unlikely, because I can't believe that this issue never came into the consideration of any of those highly learned editors. Therefore, I may suggest the following.

  

First a question...

How this vigraha provided by you is possible with a kvip-pratyayAnta "kSat" - kṣatāt trāyate iti kṣattraḥ

In the vigraha you are treating it as niSThA-pratyayAnta - "kShatAt".

  

In any case, one finds this niSThA-pratyayAnta Vigraha in Kalidasa's Raghuvamsa - "kSatAt kila trAyata ityudagrah" 2.53

But in that case, it has to be treated as a case of pRiShodarAdi-gaNa (as clearly stated in DevarAja YajvA's commentary on the NighaNTu and also in the vyAkhyA-sudhA commentary of Amara-kosha), in which case even a single "t" shouldn't be problematic at all.

Therefore, I don't think one should make a big fuss around the single or double "t" in these two cases - kShatra and kShatriya. Both versions seem correct to me.

  

Yes, if we follow the vyutpatti provided in uNadi-kosha sutra - gudRivIpacivaciyamisadikSadibhyas trah, then "kShattra" with two "tt" is inevitable.

  

In any case, the vyutpatti-prakriyA provided by you seems problematic to me because I can't see how "sampadAdibhyah kvip" vArtika can be applicable here, because the gaNa only lists 5 words, which don't include the root "kShaN", nor is it stated that it is AkRiti-gaNa.
