I am not saying the published editions are wrong or right. All I am saying is I am not sure. And the reason is the example of SY-YM 20.25 - as per Vachaspatyam it is क्षत्त्रम्, while as per the multiple editions of SY-YM Samhita (including one with करपात्रस्वामी's commentary) it is क्षत्रम्. Even शब्दकल्पद्रुम lists only क्षत्त्र/क्षत्त्रिय but not क्षत्र/क्षत्रिय. So who is correct - the editors of SY-YM Samhita or the compilers of Vachapatyam and Sabdakalpadruma? All of them were highly learned, and they differ. Which is why I would like to see what form old manuscripts had (They may very well have the single "t" form).

Typo, thanks for pointing. It would be "क्षतस्त्रायते" - I had Raghuvamsha 2.53 in mind which says क्षतात् त्रायते, and wrote क्षतात् in place of क्षतः. The meaning is the same though क्षत् = क्षत and क्षतः = क्षतात्. The Prakriya stays the same.

In which case? In the क्षत + त्र case? Can you please quote the relevant extracts and Prakriya (if given) from the Nighantu and the Amarakosha commentaries? Do they derive it from क्षत + त्र and then do a तकारलोप citing पृषोदरादित्व? Does the Nighantu commentary talk about Raghuvamsha 2.53 at all?

Maybe both are correct. I am willing to change my opinion, but before I do that, I would need to go through the commentaries you are talking about where the single "t" form is derived counting it in पृषोदरादि.

I am aware of the Unadi Kosha derivation (that is the first derivation given in Sabdakalpadruma, which also gives the सम्पदादि derivation), but that will not result in a form with a single "त्" (unless one considers पृषोदरादिगणत्वम् in this derivation too for elision of one त्).

With due respect to your opinion, Mallinatha and Taranatha Tarkavachaspati think otherwise. Please refer सञ्जीवनी commentary on Raghuvamsam 2.53 which clearly says "क्षणु हिंसायाम्" इति धातोः सम्पदादित्वात्क्विप्. The same derivation is given in Vachaspatyam under क्षत्त्र.  
  
PS: Thanks for the in-depth discussion. I had come across your Samskrita commentary on Ashtadhyayi in Chitrakoot a few months ago. Good to speak to you personally.
