Many thanks for the extract from commentaries and the links. With the क्षत्र form seen in manuscripts, I stand corrected and now believe that my previous statement on क्षत्र/क्षत्त्र was incorrect. Both forms are Paninian if we count the word in the पृषोदरादि group.

  

To summarize the three derivations -

\(1\) As per देवराज यज्वा and व्याख्यासुधा, we have क्षत+त्र which becomes क्षत्र by पृषोदरादित्व (elision ofone of the त्s and अ). By अनचि च, क्षत्र becomes क्षत्त्र. This makes both forms valid.

\(2\) As per Mallinatha's derivation, we have the form क्षत्+त्र = क्षत्त्र. This cannot become क्षत्र by झरो झरि सवर्णे as the rule is not applicable, which makes only क्षत्त्र valid. But if we allow for elision of त् by पृषोदरादित्व then it can explain क्षत्र.

\(3\) As per the Unadi-Paninian derivation, we have क्षद्+त्र = क्षत्त्र by खरि च (चर्त्व). Again this cannot become क्षत्र by झरो झरि सवर्णे, but if we allow for elision of त् by पृषोदरादित्व then it can explain क्षत्र.

Incredible achievement indeed! But on second thoughts, entirely credible and hardly surprising. After all, like \[grand\]father, like \[grand\]son. You are only doing justice to your पितृगण's eminence.

Looking forward to read it. Why don't you outsource the typing (I do that @ Rs. 30 a page) and proofread the result to save time? And maybe try out something better than Page Maker like InDesign or LaTeX?

Frankly, I don't deserve any. Especially from a person of your knowledge.

  

With humble salutations, Nityanand
