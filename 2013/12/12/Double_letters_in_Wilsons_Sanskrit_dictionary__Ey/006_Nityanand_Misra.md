Firstly, I was talking about Laukika, and not Vaidika forms. In Veda, whatever form is seen is Sadhu.  

  

Secondly, what do you mean by "Rigveda"? The oral tradition? The old manuscripts? Or modern printed editions? Think twice before trusting modern printed editions - in this context, they are not a reliable source since many editions printed in nineteenth century and later had to make compromises due to the typesetting constraints. Unless we see what form is seen in old manuscripts (or hear the authentic pronunciation in an uncorrupted oral tradition), we can never be sure.  
  

I can give you an example from my Shakha (Shukla Yajurveda Vajasaneyi Madhyandini).In most (probably all?) printed editions, SY-VM 20.25 has the form क्षत्रं with a single त्.  
  

However, refer Vachaspatyam here -

The word listed is क्षत्त्र and the example is the same Mantra SY-VM 20.25, listed with the two त्s. In fact Vachaspatyam does not list क्षत्र at all! Maybe in the manuscripts the कोषकार had access to, the 90 forms in Rgveda were with two "t"s.  
  
This shows that printed editions cannot be treated as authentic sources.  
  

Maybe in the Vedas the form with a single "त्" exists. Maybe it does not. But we need to see old manuscripts to be sure.
