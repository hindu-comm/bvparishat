Yes, I meant in the क्षत + त्र case.

देवराज यज्वा writes in his commentary on the निघण्टु - क्षतशब्दात् त्रायतेश्च क्षत्रम्, पृषोदरादिः॥  
व्याख्यासुधा on अमरकोश states - क्षतात्त्रायते वा, पृषोदरादिः॥  
As you can see, no one states what actually happens through पृषोदरादि. It was my suggestion that we do तकारलोप through पृषोदरादि to create क्षत्र.  
Just consider how वारिवाहकः becomes बलाहकः through पृषोदरादि.

No, the Nighantu commentary doesn't talk about Raghuvamsha. There the context is that of water or strength, becausein the Rig Veda क्षत्र means not only क्षत्रिय, but also आपः, बलम् and धन.

I think both are correct. Please kindly see this ancient manuscript of Raghuvamsha, where the word has been clearly written as क्षत्र, and not क्षत्त्र. Please see the words क्षत्रस्य वाचकः शब्दः towards the end of the last line on this page -<http://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-ADD-01396-00001/65>

If you find it difficult to read it and ascertain whether it is क्षत्र or क्षत्त्र, please refer to the next page, where you can clearly see how a द्वित्व "त्त्र" is written in the specific manuscript. Please see the words क्षतात् खण्डनात्त्रायत इति at the beginning of the first line on this page -<http://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-ADD-01396-00001/66>

I hope this clarifies the issue. Both versions are equally correct.

It is clearly a bit over-stretching the scope of the Vartika. But, with due respect to both great scholars, I take back my objection. Thanks for enlightening me.

Thank you very much for your kind words. I plan to publish a completely revised edition of the book, because I started writing that book when I was 16 years old, and I feel now after teaching it a few times that it requires a revision. I'm also planning to add Vartikas this time and also will dedicate a lot of effort to the Vedic Prakriyas, because Veda Samhita, Brahamana, Aranyaka and Upanishads have been the main subjects of my studies over the past 10 years. The manuscript is ready, just need to find the time and inspiration to type everything again into my laptop and the prepare a book with Page Maker.

Also my Pranams to JagadGuruji. My home was blessed by him back in the late 1980s when I had started learning Panini's Ashtadhyayi by heart. I remember reciting to him the first chapter of the Sutra Patha. It is my pleasure to get in touch with you as well. Please accept my heartfelt Pranams.
