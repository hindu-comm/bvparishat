Dear Friends,  
  
 Wish you all a very Happy and Prosperous New Year.  
  
Let me take this opportunity to announce the 'saara' system for  
computational processing of natural languages. As you may be knowing,  
the Natural Language Processing (NLP) team at the School of Computer  
and Information Sciences, University of Hyderabad, has been working  
towards the development of technologies for Indian languages all the  
way from 1987. Our work differs from all other works in terms of being  
based on a sound theoretical framework and robust architecture  
developed by us here. Alpha versions of the Kannada saara and Telugu  
saaramu systems have already been released for limited use and we plan  
to bring out the beta versions for wider use soon. The beta versions  
will include dictionaries, morphological analyzers and generators,  
stemmer/lemmatizer, spelling error detection and correction systems,  
tagger, etc. Full versions, slated for release in about an year will  
include sentence level analysis and translation facilities too. We  
have been working all along without seeking any funding from any  
source. We have now built up a consortium of experts and we hope to  
get some funding too in near future. We hope to give you high  
performance systems with guaranteed quality. We have been conducting  
hands-on workshops all over India. Kindly visit our website  
202.41.85.68 periodically for updates. We seek your involvement and  
contributions and We will be glad to work with you.  
  
Please read my 4 page article entitled "Just Think" attached.  
  
Please also read my book "Freedom" to know more about yourself and how  
to stay healthy and make the most of your life. Ask me for a copy of  
the book.  
  
Thanks and Best Regards,  
Kavi Narayana Murthy
