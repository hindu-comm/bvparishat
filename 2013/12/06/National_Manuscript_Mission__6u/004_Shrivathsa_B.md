Another example of public money going down the drain. It is public money which went into digitizing the manuscripts, there were libraries which gave the manuscripts (and many common people deposited manuscripts in the library believing that they will be preserved) and now we are told "hey!!! don't ask for any manuscript just like that... there are procedures you see! what if you land the blueprints of India's nuclear reactors? There is every possibility of the scans of those blueprints being mis-named as AshvalAyana hautrakArikA!!! can we afford such a security risk?"  
  

In its mindlessness, the manuscripts mission excels the gargantuan DLI. The DLI, a superb concept but in many cases of not much use because they have employed species other than human to give names to the scanned documents (but if you have superhuman powers of guessing, you may get a whole set of a multivolume set, in other cases, you can pray to your iShTadeva, or when searching for AshvalAyana hautrakarikA you will land... guess what?).  
  

All that we can pray is for better sense to prevail. O! My iShTadeva, please reform colonized mindsets of bhaaratiiyas!
