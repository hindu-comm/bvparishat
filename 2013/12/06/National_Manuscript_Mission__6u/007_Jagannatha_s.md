We need National Manuscript Policy under which Manuscript Libraries can sell digitized copies of Manuscripts. Mss. need not to be distributedfreely.

There shall be a conference of directors ofall manuscript libraries/ research institutes of our country for formation of the same. Directors may discuss on getting digitized manuscripts copies from abroad also.There is a common complaint regarding gettingdigitized copies of mss. fromManuscript libraries of foreign countries : They demandhefty fees. The said conference maydiscuss even this.
