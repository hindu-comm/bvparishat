Good evening sir,

I have tried searching the catalogue, but the website displays them in very unweildy way. Every page has 10 entries. If I have to search some popular manuscript - there will be at least 100 such pages. Not possible to scroll. Each page takes around 1 minute to load. Can a complete catalogue in PDF / excel or other searchable format be available to browse offline ? I don't think this is a very taxing demand.

Who are to be contacted ? The National Manuscript Mission office or the grantha bhandars which hold the manuscripts ? The problem with me (and maybe others also) is that I live far away from these manuscript resource centers. It is not possible to physically go around such centers.

I said so because it is not usable for the most of students. If after such a long exercise, the access is still this restricted, it is a heartburn for me.

I completely agree. But the question is why this procedure of making a written / email request - which might be replied to / not.

Indian copyright law acknowledges the copy right of the author till 60 years post his death. Around 99.99 percent manuscripts were written by authors / scribes who died more than 60 years ago. So I dont think there is copyright violation. The physical possession of manuscript may be with an institute, but the content therein is not copy right protected in most of the cases.

I agree.

If payment for getting a copy of manuscript is an issue - the institute / mission can very well charge. Right now, copying charges of a manuscript is usually 10 to 20 per cent of the actual travelling charges to get that thing.

I agree. But doable. If such a large database of DLI can be hosted online, I see no issue that this can not be done.

protection is done. I agree. But access is still very restricted.

Just expressed my wish. Otherwise I will follow whatever the system prevails for now.
