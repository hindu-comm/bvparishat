Sorry I don't understand how can old manuscripts be under any copyright. Its is public domain right. If they made easily accessible in a digitized format it will be useful for all scholars. I know all manuscripts in a given manuscript catalog may not be available at least those in private collections but those that are with Government funded institutions should or can be digitized for befit of all  

Digitization has its benefit and will make the manuscript wealth permanent no worms or weather can damage a digitized manuscript
