Mr Patel

Many Manuscripts are digitized by Mission but the catalogue is available on the mission's website. If you want any particular manuscript or text you can contact with concerned authority. if it is available there you can collect with some minor procedures. But do not say it is a faulty or futile exercise or waste. you should understand all procedures, copy right, responsibility etc, It is not so easy task to host on the website. Whatever these digitised, to protect and to access but not to publicise. I hope you can understand

  

Thanks
