Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



I would like to thank Vandita Arora, VKG, Sunil and Prof Korad for contributing to question on ApamAna and AvamAna. The purpose of asking question is to check the meaning I obtained using my VarNavaada and meanings explained by above mentioned scholars.



Thanks to all scholars. N.R.Joshi
