Dear Jha Ji,

  

Wish you all a very happy and prosperous New Year 2014. On the eve of this New Year, we would like to express our gratitude to you for your constant moral support and encouragement for carrying out the herculean task of completion of this**New Catalogus Catalogorum (NCC).**

**  
**

You will be happy to know that we have completed almost 37 volumes and other three (approximately) will be completed shortly. As the previous volumes 1-14 are published decades before and now more information are available from newly published catalogues and lists, the revision of these volumes has become inevitable. These volumes also were prepared in hard-copies only.



Hence it is hoped that with your valuable advice and suggestions we would like to take up the next phase of work as follows:

  

(1) Revision of NCC vols. 1-14 with additional and adequate information.

(2) Creation of data-base for all the volumes.

(3) Online linking of the same for the benefit of the scholars.

**  
**

**We will be thankful to you if your valuable suggestions and advice are received at the earliest.**

  

Thanking you,

Prof. S. Dash
