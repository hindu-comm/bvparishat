Thanks Dr. Bhattacharya for the Wackernagel Altindische Grammatik reference. I went through it and things are clearer now.  
  

For those who understand German, the book is available here <https://archive.org/details/altindischegram01debrgoog>  
  
On page 151 Wackernagel seems to suggest that the प्रातिपदिक is "सरघ्" of which the nominative singular is सरट्.  
<https://archive.org/stream/altindischegram01debrgoog#page/n236/mode/1up>  
  
On page 174 he says that that the प्रातिपदिक is "सरह्" \[??\] of which the nominative singular is सरट्.  
<https://archive.org/stream/altindischegram01debrgoog#page/n259/mode/1up>  
  

The Unadi Sutra as per Svetavanavasi and Bhattoji derives the प्रातिपदिक as "सरट्".  
  

While सरघ् and सरट् both are listed by Sabdakalpadrumah, सरह् is not. This might have caused the confusion in minds of lexicographers, assuming they relied on Sabdakalpadrumah and Vachaspatyam (as most 19th century lexicographers did). Maybe they found प्रातिपदिक सरट् in old Indian grammatical texts but सरह् only in western text(s) like that of Wackernagel, they put the ending in h with a question mark. This is a conjecture and I am not sure.  
  
Does any Indian lexicon list the प्रातिपदिक as सरह्? If not then the conjecture may be true. Older Indian Koshas list only the inflected nominative forms.
