Actually, you may want to think again. Do you plan to list the inflected nominative singular forms (सुबन्तपद)? Or the uninflected base (प्रातिपदिक)? Or both?

  

zum Beispiel, Do you list dhanam (धनम्) or dhana (धन) or both?

  

Since the 19th century, most Sanskrit "dictionaries" have listed the uninflected base (eg. dhana). An exception is Vachaspatyam, which lists the inflected nominative singular (e.g. dhanam). Ancient Indian "Koshas", since they were in spoken Sanskrit, listed the inflected nominative singular.

  

So I would say the answer depends in your choice of listing type, and your agreement or disagreement with Dr. Bhattacharya.  

  

1\. If you choose to list the uninflected base AND you believe in what Wackernagel says (like Dr. Bhattacharya), then you want to list "sarah"

2\. If you choose to list the uninflected base AND you would rather believe in Bhattoji Dikshita's Siddhantakaumudi (as I do, since it has a Unadi-Paninian derivation), then you want to list "saraṭ".

3\. If you choose to list the inflected nominative singular, then whether you believe in Wackernagel or Bhattoji, you want to list "saraṭ".

  

Needless to say, the compilation needs to be consistent - either all uninflected forms, or all nominative singulars.
