Dear Dr. Ramanujan,

Thanks for your note. There is no doubt that the received form in 1/1 is saraṭ. But what is its historical origin? Wackernagel Altindische Grammatik I 151, 173-175 etc. has traced its origin in *h* of palatal origin. The theory behind this was stated by me with reference. I also gave analogical examples like *avāṭ* \<*vah* aor.3/1.

Best
