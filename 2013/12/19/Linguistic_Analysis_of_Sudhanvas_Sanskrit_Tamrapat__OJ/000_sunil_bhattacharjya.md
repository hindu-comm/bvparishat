Dear friends,  
  

King Sudhanva's Tamrapatra is a copper-plate-charter in Sanskrit and this has been mentioned in "Vimarsh", a work published by the Dwarka math. Based on this the Dwarka math claims that in the 5th century BCE King Sudhanva gave a grant to the Dwarka math, which was established by Adi Sankaracharya and that king Sudhanva was a contemporary of Adi Shankaracharya. . **It will be good to know if any Sanskrit scholar /
linguist studied the text of that Tamrapatra to assess if any dating is possible from that linguistically.** The text however gives a 5th century BCE date for this event. Some scholars have raised their eyebrows as the Tamrapatra is no longer traceable.  
  
Mr. R.M.Umesh, an ex.- press secretary to Jagadguru Shankaracharya of Shringeri, wrote a book entitled "Shankara's date", in which he criticised the Dwarka math for writing about the Sudhanva's Tamrapatra in the "Vimarsh". However Mr. Umesh ignored the fact that Swami Vidyaranya, the 13th century illustrious Mathadhipati of the Shringeri math also wrote in the 15th chapter of his Shankara-Digvijaya about King Sudhanva accompanying Adi Shankaracharya. Though Mr. Umesh goes on to claim a 8th century CE date for Adi Shankaracharya, no Indian history text has mentioned any king called Sudhanva in the 8th century CE. This shows that the date of Adi Shankaracharya could not have been living in the 8th century CE.  
  

The text of Sudhanva's Tamrapatra, as available to me, is attached, for the perusal of those scholars, who had not seen that yet.
