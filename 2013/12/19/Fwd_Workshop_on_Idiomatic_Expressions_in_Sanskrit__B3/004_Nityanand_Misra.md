I made a typo - missed the "r" in "Sriramachandra". However, in the book I was talking about, he is credited as "Pullela Sriramachandra" only, and not "Pullela Srirama Chandrudu". You can verify this here -<http://www.exoticindiaart.com/book/details/sanskrit-idioms-phrases-and-suffixational-subtleties-IDK338/>

The author name on the book cover is spelt "पुल्लेल श्रीरामचन्द्रः"  

  

For your infrormation, many authors use the pure Samskrita name in Samskrita works. An example is Rewa Prasad Dwivedi Ji, whose last name is "Dwivedi" but he uses the Samskrit version रेवाप्रसादद्विवेदः
