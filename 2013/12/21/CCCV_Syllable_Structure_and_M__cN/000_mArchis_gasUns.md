Namaste,

  

Is **CCCV** actually a rare syllable in Sanskrit? I do not think so.

But it depends upon how we treat anusvara.

  

lengthening of the preceding vowel, or a consonantal segment, such as a nasal  
fricative homorganic (i.e. sharing the same place of articulation) to the following consonant.

<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anusvara>

  

bindu alone is used to stand ambiguously for both a nasal voweland a nasal consonant.

CVCCCVCV 788 0,31% karttṛkā 8 W

  

One could say ii is rare, only if VCCC, CVCC, CCVC occur much more offen, right?

I'm aware only of Elizarenkova 2004.

  

Thanks,
