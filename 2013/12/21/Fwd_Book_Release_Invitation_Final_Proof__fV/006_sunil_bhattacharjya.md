Dear Prof. Shrinivasa Varakhedi  
  

Congratulations for undertaking and completing such a big project. I have a small query and wish to know if you have dealt with it. Most people think the beginning of Navyanyaya with Udayana. However I read somewhere that the real progenitor of Navyanyaya is Vacaspati Mishra. Would you like to give a brief reply?  
  

Regards,  

Sunil KB
