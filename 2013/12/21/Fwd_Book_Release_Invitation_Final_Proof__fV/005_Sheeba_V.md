**About the Book**

Navya-Nyāya school of thought is a unique school in Indian philosophy for its contribution and influence on other schools. This is because, the new age school developed a technical language that later became the language of all Śāstric discourses. The Navya-Nyāya language was used in different dialectics of ontologically opposite philosophies, for example, in the *Advaitasiddhi* by Madhusūdana Sarasvati, in the *Pūrvamīmāṃsā* by Khaṇḍadeva and in the *Bhāṭṭarahasya* and so on. It is also employed in later grammatical works of Pāṇinian school, poetics, Hindu law, and other branches of Indic studies. In one sense this language is considered as language of philosophy in India. It is therefore, strongly recommended to undertake the study of Navya-Nyāya language and the ontology of Vaiśeṣikas for the students of any Indian śāstric school, without which one cannot paraphrase a single line of śāstric monograph written in Navya-Nyāya style. Hundreds of monographs dealing with different subjects in different disciplines are authored in Navya-Nyāya language that show the influence of this language on Indian schools of thought. The basic elements of Navya-Nyāya language have been dealt with in the present work.

In contemporary western philosophy, the language of logic has been developed and used extensively across disciplines as the language of Mathematics is used in all branches of science. In recent development, language of mathematics and logic has become one and took a new path in the form of Knowledge Representation medium in Artificial Intelligence of Computer Science. This area is a prominent field of study and research. The contrast and synergy between the Knowledge Representation methodologies of Navya-Nyāya technical language and western symbolic and mathematical language or First Order Predicate Calculus or conceptual graphs, are introduced to the Sanskrit readers in this work. The usage of graphical representation is a speciality of this book.
