Namaste!

  

I have been trying to locate puranic sources of Vibhutiyoga of the Gita for some time. I could find only the following articles on this subject till now.

  

Puranic Sources of the Vibhutiyoga in the Gita - AP Karmarkar  

An article in Hindi on 'Maharshinam Bhriguraham' by Ramsankar Bhattacharya

An article in Hindi on 'Why Valmiki is not named in Vibhutiyoga?' by Ramsankar Bhattacharya.

  

Of these the first one is very brief and the others deal with the subject only partially. I request the learned members to let me know of any commentaries or any other articles on the Puranic sources of Vibhutiyoga in detail. For instance it is not known why Asvatha is considered most superior among all trees or Usana among kavis..I assume these details would have been provided by some commentator.

shankara
