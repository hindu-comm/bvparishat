Namaste!  
  
I think I failed to convey my question properly in my first mail. Srikrishna would have had some reason to choose a certain entity or person as His vibhuti in a certain category as listed in Vibhutiyoga of the Gita. But, the reasons for choosing a certain entity or person as vibhuti is not provided in the Gita or in the commentaries that I read. I thought that there could be some commentary that provides the reasons for choosing the vibhutis in the Gita. Or else, the Puranas might contain some explanations for choosing a certain entity or person as vibhuti of Bhagavan. I request all scholars to point out any information about such commentaries, articles or Puranic passages that deal with this subject.
