Namaste!  
  
The question 'why Valmiki is not named as best among Kavis' is explained in a simple and convincing manner by Ramsankar Bhattacharya in his article mentioned in my first mail. I have uploaded the article to <http://www.mediafire.com/?vpi5o3417y6dl>  
  
As Shreevatsaji pointed out, commentators like Sri Ramanuja have given explanations for some of the vibhutis, but not all vibhutis in one commentary. I would like to know if such details have been compiled into a book.

shankara
