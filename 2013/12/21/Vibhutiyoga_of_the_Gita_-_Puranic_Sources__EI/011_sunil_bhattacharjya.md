Dear friends,

Thus Sri Vasantakumar Bhatt may be right in holding that Krishna was not the author of the entire Gitaa as we have it now.*

Not to speak of me, to my knowledge, nobody has ever denied that the versification of the Bhagavad Gita was done by Vedavyasa. Lord Krishna gave the spiritual knowledge to Arjuna and that was definitely through a conversation only and that conversation was put into verse by Vedavyasa. The language and the meters in the Bhagavad Gita are pre-paninian and these should not be judged by the Paninian rules. Moreover the Mahabharata is known to have the Kuta slokas, which Vedavyasa introduced, presumably to reduce the speed of the scribe and one should not forget that these kuta verses obviously are exceptional / extra-ordinary compositions, scattered throughout the Mahabharata.

Also it would be pertinent to ask what was the popularity of the Bhagavadgiitaa in the very ancient times, in the pre-Samkara period.

One who has read the Shankara-bhashya on the Bhagavad Gita knows that Shankara mentioned that a number of people tried to write commentary on the Bhagavad Gita but did not succeed. Those attempts ended up in giving only grammatical analyses. That is enough for one to understand that the Bhagavad Gita, till the time of Adi Shankaracharya, was considered a difficult text. This is also in line with Vedavyasa's own admission in the beginning of the Bhagavatam that the Mahabharata did not turn out to be an easy text for people to understand, though Vedavyasa's aim was to make the Mahabharata intelligible to all. From the reason cited above, it is clearly obvious that the Bhagavad Gita became popular after Adi Shankaracharya wrote his bhashya on it. That is definitely the reason for the Bhjagavad Gita not being that popular in the pre-Shankara times.  

  
Further the Bhagavad Gita has been mentioned in the other puranas like Padma purana and Varaha purana, which speak about the greatness of the Bhagavad Gita. It is also mentioned in the puranic texts like Vaishnaviya Tantra - saar.
