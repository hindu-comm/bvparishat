Regarding the 'ashwattha' tree spoken of as a vibhUti of/by the Lord, one reference that could be seen as being useful in determining/appreciating the same is found in the Chandogya upanishad 8.5.3:  

    अथ यदनाशकायनमित्याचक्षते ब्रह्मचर्यमेव तदेष
    ह्यात्मा न नश्यति यं ब्रह्मचर्येणानुविन्दतेऽथ
    यदरण्यायनमित्याचक्षते ब्रह्मचर्यमेव तदरश्च ह वै
    ण्यश्चार्णवौ ब्रह्मलोके तृतीयस्यामितो दिवि तदैरं
    मदीयँ सरस्तदश्वत्थः सोमसवनस्तदपराजिता
    पूर्ब्रह्मणः प्रभुविमितँ हिरण्मयम् ||८. ५. ३||

    For this word the shAnkara bhAShyam says:

    ..तत्र हि ब्रह्मलोके.....तत्रैव चाश्वत्थो वृक्षः सोमसवनो

    नामतः सोमोऽमृतं तन्निःस्रवोऽमृतस्रव इति वा ।

    It is the ashwattha tree (with the name 'somasavanaH') in Brahmaloka

    that secretes nectar/ambrosia.

    Maybe the Lord specifies this tree as His

    vibhUti.  It is not uncommon that there
    are several other-worldly objects cited

    by the Lord as His vibhUti, for example, the 

    ucchaishravas (among horses), airAvatam (among superior

    elephants), which entities are not of this
    world.  

    Since I came across this reference to

    'ashwattha' while reading the chandogya

    upanishat, I thought I will share the 

    information.
