In the Gitamaahatmya which is a part of the PadmapuraaNa (?) where we get how the Bhagavadgiitaa was ' milked' by Krishna (as it says dogdhaa gopaalanandanaH), it is clearly said (I am writing from my memory, so some passages I have forgotten)  

  

सर्वोपनिषदो गावो दोग्धा गोपालनन्दनः ।  
अश्वत्थामविकर्णघोरमकरा दुर्योधनावर्तिनी ।  

कर्णेन वेलाकुला ।  

*व्यासेन ग्रथिता पुराणमुनिना मध्ये महाभारतम् ।  
  
*

So the ancient PuraaNa text is very clear that only the basic theme of the Gitaa was taught by Krishna which was elaborated and weaved into the Mahaabhaarata by the sage Vyaasa.*  
*Thus Sri Vasantakumar Bhatt may be right in holding that Krishna was not the author of the entire Gitaa as we have it now.*  
*

Also it would be pertinent to ask what was the popularity of the Bhagavadgiitaa in the very ancient times, in the pre-Samkara period.  

Could it be that it was Samkara who popularised it by composing a commentary which was followed by other Vedaanta teachers ??  

For, in no ancient inscription do we find any reference or mention of the Bhagavadgiitaa. Were it so popular and conveyed the essence of the Upanishads, why has it not been found mentioned in such ancient records or even in contemporary literature ?*
