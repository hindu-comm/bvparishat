Dear Vasantkumar Bhattji,  
  

That Vedavyasa composed the Jayasamhita of 8000 verses and that the Bharata of 24,000 verses was recited by Vaishampayana and that Sauti recited the Mahabharata of 100,000 verses (including of course the Harivamsha) has been refuted in the Adi parva itself, where it is boldly said that Vedavyasa composed the Mahabharata of 100,000 verses (including of course the Harivamsha).  
  

Secondly the Mahabharata itself says in the Gitamana verse that the Bhagavad Gita had 745 verses and it has given the break-up also. So it is not a question of tradition but of fact. One can recite the Bhagavad Gita from memory if about one hour or so and Lord Krishna could have spent hardly an hour for the discourse, particularly when Arjuna laid down his weapons. According to the rules of the Mahabharata war he was not vulnerable to attack as no unarmed person was to be attacked in the war. Moreover after the discourse was over Arjuna joined Yudhisthira and together they went to the elders to seek the permission to start the war. So there is not an iota of doubt that the Bhagavad Gita is genuine. The ancient people in India, particularly the sages were basically honest unlike the people from the West, who invaded India and wanted to derogate the ancient texts. Dr. Khair was most likely misled by the writings of the western scholars.
