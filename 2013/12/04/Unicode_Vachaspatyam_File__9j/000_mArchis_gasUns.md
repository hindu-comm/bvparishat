Namaste,

  

 I need help with Vachaspatyam. First of all what I want to make is a version without brackets (so online text search would work). The digital dictionary is slowly converted to Unicode. But no matter how we write words in (what encoding we use) it there is a list of 1672 words, which use () brackets (from #741 till #3487). I have solved 42 cases myself, started from the end of the list. Left "?" where unsure. But there are several more lists which need my attention, so help would speed the work up and make it accessible in months to come, not years.

<https://www.dropbox.com/s/9umszwe00jw1r8s/Vachaspatyam_b5_proof_1673.xlsx> in IAST, can convert the same in devanagari (Microsoft Excel file, will work on

Excel 2003 and above) contains "All_list \_without_dev", the very first words are the ones that need approval or manual editing. Legend of the columns of the .xls file:

-   A - unique word ID from database  
-   B - word as written in the printed dictionary  
-   C - word or part of word before brackets  
-   D - what is replaced  
-   E - with what is replaced  
-   F - word or part of word after brackets  
-   G - word without brackets, brackets are killed.  
-   H - word with the text integrated from brackets, but only in one
    variant (full replacement of the  
    same amount of letters which are included in the brackets),
    otherwise contains many "wrong" words  
-   J - manual entry of how words in H should have actually look like.
    If no change needed, leave empty.  
-   K - abtract markup to note what was wrong. If everything fine, just
    enter 5, than I will not have to look up the same word twice.  

  

It would make the Tirupati revival of Vachaspatyam one step closer to UTF-8 and it could be easily shared and reused in several ways, as it's open to any changes, just a .txt file at the end (or .xls, if you prefer). The task is huge and what I do I document at<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YYTM2hlDYKPzKv322Cfq0Oa92RohvMzvF5jf8eqIO7w/edit#>To give, I need to take. Not for my own sake, but for the sake of good old Sanskrit dictionaries that deserve it,

  

Thanks,

Marcis from Moscow
