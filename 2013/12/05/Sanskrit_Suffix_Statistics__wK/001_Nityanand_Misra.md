Gospodin Marcis, 

  

Apte Sanskrit Hindi Kosha has a list of Krt (non-conjugational suffixes directly affixed to roots), Taddhita (non-gender suffixes affixed to nouns/adjectives) and Unadi suffixes at the beginning.Check if you can see the pages online (if not I will scan the pages from my book which is the 1988 edition) -

  

<http://books.google.com.hk/books?id=bsSZ27z5fSYC&printsec=frontcover>  

  

Page 11 and 12 have the suffixes listed. The catch is the suffixes are with the indivative letters, so you will see टाप् but not आ.

  

There must be other online and offline resources on list ofKrt andTaddhitasuffixes.
