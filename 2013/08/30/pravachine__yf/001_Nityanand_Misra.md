Thanks, this is helpful. You mentioned that the manuscript is illegible/torn at some places, so here is a guess from a metrical perspective. If the verse follows the common Anustup rule that the sixth syllable of each quarter is heavy, then it should be वा and not व. That would give you प्रवाचिने which is प्र वच् णिनि ङे.  
  
Maybe somebody can come up with better ideas if a photograph/scan of the verse as in the original manuscript is shared.
