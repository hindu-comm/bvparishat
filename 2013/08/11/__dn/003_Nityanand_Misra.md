One may also refer The Travancore State Manual (1906), Volume 2. Chapter 9, p. 248

<http://books.google.com/books?id=juc2AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA248>

  

The book gives two derivations of Nambutiri as

  

"Nambu (=sacred/trusted) + Tiri (honorofic suffix)"

"Nam (=knowledge) + Purayati (one who imparts) (sic)"

  

Looks like a case of mixed Samskrita/Prakrit derivation.

  

Just like Tiri/Tiru in Tamil/Telugu/Malyalam are from Samskrita "Shri" (e.g. Tirumati/Tirupati/Tiruvanantapuram), similarly we have "Ter" in Maithili from "Shri" (e.g. one name for Mithila is "Terhut" which comes from श्रीहूति as per Swami Akhandananda Sarawati).

  

Maybe the "tiri/dri/thiri" variations come from paucity of consonants in Tamil (the "Kogul" phenomenon as commonly known on the Intenet)?
