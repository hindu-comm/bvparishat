It is common to observe that the village name is adopted as *griha naama* in Andhra pradesh. I believe, this custom is common to Maharashtra too. There is a small village called 'Namburu' in the Guntur district of Andhra state. People who migrated (long ago) to Kerala are known as 'Namputiris' (*namburi--> nambutiri*) - this is the *jana sruti* in our region. Though, Dr. Vishnu has justified it very well, would love to listen more on this.  
  

With regards,
