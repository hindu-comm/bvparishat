Respected All,



Namaste. This query is being posted on behalf of a friend.



My friend is in search of akosha titled '*kalpadruma'* that has been apparently authored by Keshava Daivajna. This seems to be written in the 17th century. A google search revealed no more than this information. Any further detailsin this regardare highly appreciated.



Regards,

Prasad
