 ``Namaskaara ..



I have taken the data from the chart given by Prof.Narahari Achar, Memphis University, USA.

We may also look at the data available in the works of Aryabhata (476-550 AD). He has stated that *Kaliyuga* started 3600 years before, when he was 23 years old. Accordingly, Kaliyuga started in 3102 BC \[Aryabhateeya ref-1\]). It would date *Mahabharata* war to around circa 3130-3140 BC.
