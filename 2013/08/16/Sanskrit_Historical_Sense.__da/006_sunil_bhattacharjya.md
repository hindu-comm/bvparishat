Namaste,  
  
You said that you found from your studies (based on Planetary configurations mentioned in Bhagavata purana ) that the year 2013 CE happens to be the 5125th birth anniverasary of Lord Krishna. Thus according to your calculation Lord Krishna should have been born in 2013 - 5125 = - 3112 CE. (or 3113 BCE). As Lord Krishna lived for 125 years it would mean that according to you Lord Krishna passed away in
3113 - 125 = 2988 BCE. The Bhagavata purana also states that the Kali yuga started on the very day the Lord Krishna passed away. So you are claiming that the Yali yuga started in 2988 BCE and not in 3102 BCE. That is why I find your findings difficult to accept. Will you like to look at this situation. May be Dr. Achar will also like to add his scholarly views here.  
  

Regards,
