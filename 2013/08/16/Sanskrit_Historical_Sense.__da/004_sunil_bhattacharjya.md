Namaste,  
  

It will be very kind of you if you can kindly let us know the data you used from the Bhagavatam which enabled you to arrive at Lord Krishna birth in 3112 BCE. Dr. B.R.Raman took the help of the reputed astronomer Fagan and arrived at the date of Lord Krishna's birth as 3227 BCE.  
  

Regards,
