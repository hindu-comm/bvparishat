\> I have taken the data from the chart given by Prof.Narahari Achar, Memphis University, USA.  
\> We may also look at the data available in the works of Aryabhata (476-550 AD). He has stated that Kaliyuga started 3600 years before, when he was 23 years old.  
  

I don't see how Aryabhatta's age at the start of the Kaliyuga is pertinent, but this is anyway implausible as it implies that he lived to an age of at least 3623 years!  

  
\> Accordingly, Kaliyuga started in 3102 BC \[Aryabhateeya ref-1\]). It would date Mahabharata war to around circa 3130-3140 BC.  
  

I do believe 3102 BCE and 3138 BCE are the classical dates for the start of the Kaliyuga and the big war, yes.
