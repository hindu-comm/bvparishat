In the Mahabhashya of वृद्धिरादैच् । itself, अयस्मयादीनि च्छन्दसि । sutra was also discussed by the Bhashyakara and it is seen in different places in many Sutras themselves, both पदसञ्ज्ञा as well as भसञ्ज्ञा are used in the same place which is not permitted in Loukika Samskrita. That is one of the reason that he concludes there by saying छन्दोवत् सूत्राणि प्रवर्तन्ते।
