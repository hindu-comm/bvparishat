Ajit Ji!  
Thanks for your kind interest in helping me. The information you have extended me is of great value. I shall be always grateful if you can send the copy of Ekavali by a private mail as you said. As I have been out of station during the last three days I could not immediately reply you.,  

  
Warm regards,  

**Dr. Rani Sadasiva Murty**
