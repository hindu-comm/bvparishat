Dear Prof. Dash,

There is no doubt that the passing away of Prof. S.D. Joshi is a huge loss to the academic fraternity of Sanskrit language and literature. The tribute posted by you in BVP touched my heart.You will be glad to know that the establishment of the School of Vedic Studies at Rabindra Bharati University, Kolkata was recommended by Prof. Joshi as a Chairman of the UGC Visiting Committee and the project of Cultural Index to Vedic Literature ( now published by M/S Manohar Publications, New Delhi) was assigned to the School. Following his recommendations the School is progressing well. Personally I met him several times (at his residence also) and was fortunate enough to receive his blessings. I pray -- May his great soul rest in peace!

I am glad to learn that seven volumes (26th-32nd) of NCC have recently been published. Congratulations for your best efforts. You know I have already collected Vols upto 25th, so the rest is to be procured. Pl. advise me the process of purchase and the amount of money to be sent for the purpose.

Best regards,

Nabanarayan Bandyopadhyay
