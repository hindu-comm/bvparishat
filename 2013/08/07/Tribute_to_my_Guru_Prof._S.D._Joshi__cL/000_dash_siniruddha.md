**Tribute to my Guru Prof. S.D. Joshi, a great scholar of Sanskrit**

***Cakşurunmilitam yena tasmai śrī gurave namah***

***

Many might have heard of him. Some might have seen him, but few might have been fortunate to share few moments with Prof. Joshi about his personal experience. I am one of them who moved with him so closely for almost one decade. I was called by him as *Dashbabu* and later all seniors also followed suit.

   

 I was fortunate enough to get his love and affection more like a son than a disciple. His smile always inspired us to do anything possible. I owe my gratefulness to him for what I am today. I have come to Chennai only with his guidance and blessings. His continuous encouragements have made us possible to near the completion of *New Catalogus Catalogorum* (NCC) Project of which 36 (out of 40) Volumes are completed by now.

  

He was instrumental in expediting the progress of the *Sanskrit Dictionary Project* of Deccan College after his retirement. He was man of great character, with confidence, but sober and sympathetic to those who work for Sanskrit. His love for Sanskrit is beyond our imagination. He tried his best to hold the glory of CASS at the highest level. He welcomed and encouraged students and scholars from various parts of India and abroad, so that everybody learns Sanskrit well and do the best possible. He extended all type of help including financial support to those who were in urgent need.  

  

 I had just visited him on 15^(th) July 2013, 15 days before he passed away. He was talking freely and enquiring the wellbeing of all. He was happy to know the progress of *New Catalogus Catalogorum* Project and I promised him to show him the last volume by the end of March 2014. He was equally anxious about the *Sanskrit Dictionary Project* of Deccan College. Sited to a wheel chair, he expressed his serious concern about many unfinished works left by him. The encouragement I got from his smiling face and free talk will give me inspiration for the whole of my life.  

  

 It was very shocking to know that on 30^(th) July he passed away. It is no doubt an insurmountable personal loss to me but a great loss to Sanskrit Grammatical and Linguistic studies. I pray God to give enough strength to Madam, who was just like *chāyā* to the *kāyā* of Prof. Joshi.
