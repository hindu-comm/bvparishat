Dear Scholars,

Now-a-days,many SANSKRITISTS ARE BECOMING a-SANSKRIT and the awards from the Govt.Agencies are as if distributed like the prasadam. What
you need is not necessarily scholarship in Sanskrit,but,your ability/expertise to find approach to the Prize-giving Agencies.It is really a pity,and jnana-vidambanaa as well as daivadurvilaasa that many of the sincere,sound and dedicated scholars do not get any Awards,but,those second-rate or third-rate scholars get the awards,mostly on non-academic ground-and more so on political basis,because,they know how to approach the key persons involved in giving awards.Less said is better,more said is worst. If you go through the list of Awardees for the last ten/fifteen/twenty years, you will understand the purport of my statement.It appears that now-a-days,it is a practice to give away Awards to tom dick and harry along with some really worthy scholars.Here,we should not forget the subhaashita- kacam manim kanchanamekasutre badhnanti mudha na hi chitam atra/vicharvan paninirekasutre shvanam yuvanam maghavanamah //

Even if somebody brings it to the notice of the authorities,it is not going to improve the situation,because,most of our scholars indulge in this kind of game to honour their friends/teachers [etc.by](http://etc.by) making the use or misuse of their positions.

Am very sorry to write such a caustic letter,but,it may give an inkling of my anguish as well as of others' anguish on such a pitiable situation the Sanskrit scholars/scholarship are/is reduced to.

Please kindly excuse me and try to realize my intense sentiments.

Thanks for patient reading and trying to understand the reality-which you cannot deny even if it annoys you.

  

Prof.Siddharth Y.Wakankar
