Dear Scholars,

  

I am looking for the meaning of Brahma Akkar Vriti (Vritti). I cannot find it on the web. A friend translated it for me as: "Brahman is beyond movement/change". Is this correct?

  

What I do find on the web is 'Brahmakara Vritti'. I have found a few interpretations of this, from, 'the highest expansion of mind into infinite nature, to, 'devout thoughts into the nature of god......' + more.

  

So, I am not clear if both of these: 'Brahma Akkar Vriti' and 'Brahmakara Vritti'are the same?

And what is the meaning of 'Brahma Akkar Vriti'?

  

And, what is this saying... or these 2 sayings from? I cannot find a reference, either.

  

Thank you in advance for any and all help.

  

Ayam Atma Brahma
