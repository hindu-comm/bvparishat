There is no such word as "Akkar" in Samskrita. I do not know what you meant to write with "Braham" and "Vriti". Please double check (and if possible, cite) the source where you read or heard this phrase. When seeking meanings of words or phrases, please write in Devanagari or a suitable transliteration scheme so that it is easier for scholars to help you.
