It seems to be a coined word in the Neo Vedanta philosophy as it is explained in English Text in the following book in this link:

  

<http://www.swami-krishnananda.org/realis/realis_5b.html>

  

The 



'Brahma Akkar Vriti' does not seem to be a Sanskrit word, especially the second two. Though ब्रह्म is a common concept in Indian Vedanta Philosophy, irrespective of the interpretations by different teachers according to their insights. Unless you get the sources for your coined words you find on the web pages, it is difficult to get any meaning from Sanskrit Philosophy as such unless they are commonly used in the source Texts of Vedanta. And you may not get any meaning for them in a standard Sanskrit dictionary.

  

Hope some others may shed light in this respect.
