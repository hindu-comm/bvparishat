brahmAkAravR^ittiH (ब्रह्माकारवृत्तिः) is the correct word. It means 'a vR^itti which has shape of brahman'.  

vR^itti again means a mental transformation. In other words vR^itti is another name of knowledge or thoughts, etc.

No, the translation is not correct.

They are near to the accurate meaning.

If you are sure that some word like 'Brahma Akkar Vriti' exists, then it is not a sanskrit word and is not same as the second word.

As the word is alien to sanskrit uses, I can't say what this means in other languages.

The correct use is common to works of advaita-vedAnta.
