Mr. Bhat and Mr. Jha,

  

You are both right. The word above is correct. My Guruji wrote it in his own way, but as I was reading all the responses and the links supplied, it appeared that Brahmakara Vritti is correct. Also, Akhandakar Vritti., and also Mr. Jha's response above.

  

The source of Brahama Akkar Vriti was my Guruji, not any special book nor any specific Samskrit word. It was his way of spelling it. And, that was all I had to go on.So thank you all for clearing it up and supplying the correct version.

  

I am a little confused at the explanations, as some of them cancel each other out. I understand Krishnananda's and a few other pages of explanations, but I still am not clear as to call it "Knowledge of Brahman" or not, since it says that the' Vritti' is still a mental experience. Also says that this is the last Vritti and will be destroyed when Brahman is attained. It also says that it is the act of jdentifying with Brahman. So, not sure. In Vedanta, it says Knowledge of Brahman, or being Brahman itself. Complete merging into the Consciousness. Oneness in Brahman.

  

Since Poonjaji is Advita, I would tend to go with the last one.

  

Any reply to this?

  

Thank you all for all your help,

  

Chandi Devi
