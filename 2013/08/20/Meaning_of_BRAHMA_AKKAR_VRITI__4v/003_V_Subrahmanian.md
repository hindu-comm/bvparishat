The term 'brahAkAravRtti' is admitted in the classical Advaita Vedanta.
It has other synonyms such as 'akhaNDAkAravRtti', 'AtmAkAravRtti'and 'brahmavidyA', 'sAkShAtkAraH'. While the first usage of this term is not known to me right now, it is certain that the concept is quite correctly represented in the article referred to by Sri Bhat.  
  

This vRtti is admitted to be a क्षणत्रयात्मिका वृत्तिः - it arises in the first moment, destroys avidyA in the second moment and itself gets destroyed in the third moment.  
  

While this is so, the term is also used, not mistakenly, though, to represent the state of the mind of an aparokSha jnAni who is predominantly given to samadhi. The Vivekachudamani verse:  
  
ब्रह्माकारतया सदा स्थिततया निर्मुक्‍तबाह्यार्थधी- रन्यावेदितभोग्यभोगकलनो निद्रालुवद्‌बालवत्‌।  
स्वप्‍नालोकितलोकवज्‍जगदिदं पश्‍यन्‍क्‍वचिल्‍लब्धधी- रास्ते कश्‍चिदनन्तपुण्यफलभुग्धन्यः स मान्यो भुवि॥ ४२५॥   

and the aparokShAnubhuti / tejobindu upaniShad:  
  
निर्विकारतया वृत्त्या ब्रह्माकारतया पुनः वृत्तिविस्मरणं सम्यक्समाधिर्ज्ञानसंज्ञकः॥१२४॥ The complete forgetfulness of all thought by first making it changeless and then identifying it with Reality is called samadhi, known also as true knowledge.  
  

Here are two instances from Shankaracharya's bhashya where the above concept is unmistakably stated:  
  

1\. ...बुद्धिर्गुहा, तस्यां निहितं ब्रह्म, तद्वृत्त्या विवेकतया उपलभ्यते इति । (तैत्तिरीयोपनिषत् - २.१ भाष्ये)  
  
  
2. ज्ञानस्य द्वैतनिवृत्तिक्षणव्यतिरेकेण क्षणान्तर-अनवस्थानात् ।
अवस्थाने च अनवस्थाप्रसङ्गात् , द्वैत-अनिवृत्तेः ।  
  
\[Knowledge, as a mental state, vRtti, does not continue for a second moment  
following that of the cessation of duality. Should it, however, continue, it will lead to  
infinite regress resulting in non-cessation of duality. \]  
  
In this bashya, the Acharya uses a word 'jnAnasya'. And says that it does not continue  
for even a second after it has arisen and has effected the cessation of duality.
