SAdara praNAm,  

There are two works in Hindi  

VichAra SAgara and Vrtti PrabhAkara  
(authored by SAdhu NischaladAS)  
which deals in detail about Vritti JnAna  

I don't know whether English translation  
is available.It all seems to starts from the  

term "Chittavritti' in Yoga SUtra.  

Namaste
