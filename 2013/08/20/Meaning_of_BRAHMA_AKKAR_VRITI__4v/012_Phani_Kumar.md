Namaste. In some parts of the north and south, dvitva aksharas are not pronounced correctly. For instance,in the north Dharmendra is Dharmender. PadmaSri is padam sri. There is a padam vir singh too known to me. Again, in Tamil satyam is sathiam, prabhakar is pirabakar tyaga is tiyaga, rahasyam is ragasiyam etc. Braham, clearly is brahma like padam is padma and akkar is aakaar whether such a vritti exists or not.

If we do not recognize these words as regional peculiarities, and start looking for meanings for these regional forms, it will be a profitless pursuit IMHO.
