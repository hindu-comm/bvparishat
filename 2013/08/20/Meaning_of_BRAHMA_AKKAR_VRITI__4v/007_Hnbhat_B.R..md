This is what I just wanted the poster of the query.

  

If he is using any standard terminology, better it would be in Devanagari with the source where he found it.

  

Just flat query I found this and this, may bring out many undesired comments.

  

Braham akkar or Brahm akkar or any such corrupt form may lead to as many Sanskrit terms.

  

ब्रह्मन् and वृत्ति are popular and commonly used in Vedanta Schools. वृत्ति with कर or आकार or अक्कर् is not known. Only चित्तवृत्ति is called by वृत्ति following योग terminology commonly accepted. Only the combination is rare and dependent on the different interpretations. Here it may refer to ब्रह्माकारा वृत्तिःbrahmākārāvṛtti\[ḥ\]nd could not possibly brahma kara or akkar vṛtti\[ḥ\].

  

This is only guess from the context. But concept itself is to be traced identically to some Vedanta texts if possible. The concept may be found particular to one Vedanta School as Subrahmanyam has quoted some lines. For complete understanding, one may have to know all the concepts related with this concept and not isolated explanation will yield anything within the scope of the message box in the forum.

  

This is my frank opinion on the query.

  

Thanks for
