Namaste  

  

I think there will be no confusion if the various statements are understood in a cogent fashion.  
  

1.  "Knowledge of Brahman" or not, since it says that the' Vritti' is
    still a mental experience. This is correct because like any other
    knowledge, knowing Brahman is also a mental event, requiring a
    pramANa and a vRtti. 'manasaivAnu draShTavyam' says the
    KaThopaniShat.\[with the instrumentality of the mind alone Brahman
    has to be apprehended\]  
2.  Also says that this is the last Vritti and will be destroyed when
    Brahman is attained. This means that that is the last vRtti of the
    aspirant AS an aspirant; after that event of aparokShajnAna he is no
    longer an aspirant but verily Brahman as per Advaita. It does not
    mean that the aparokShajnAni will not have vRttis thereafter; they
    will be viewed by him as an object and not as subject. 3.  It also says that it is the act of jdentifying with Brahman. So, not
    sure. In Vedanta, it says Knowledge of Brahman, or being Brahman
    itself. Complete merging into the Consciousness. Oneness in Brahman.
    Even this is not contradictory. That vRtti is the one that gives
    the aspirant the direct experience of his true nature: Brahman.
    'Brahma veda brahmaiva bhavati' is the Mundaka upanishad vAkyam and
    hence there is no problem here. 'Complete merging' only means that
    the aspirant has no other erroneous-identities other than his true
    identity of being Brahman before, now and hereafter.

I think to discuss more than this here would not be appropriate.
