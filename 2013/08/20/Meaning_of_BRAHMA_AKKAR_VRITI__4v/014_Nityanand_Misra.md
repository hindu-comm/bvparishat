Please do not assume. For all you know, "Akkar" may refer to अक्कड़ (as in अक्कड़ मक्कड़ or अक्कड़ बक्कड़) or even अक्खड़ (as in nonchalant/rude) - such terms are often used by some वाममार्गी Sadhus. There is a famous Sadhu named अड़गड़ानन्द महाराज whose camp I personally saw at the Prayaga Mahakumbha this year. So it depends on the region/language/sampradaaya, etc.  
  
It is the responsibility of the questioner to clarify from her Guru what word was referred to by "Akkar" and then ask here. A good question is clear and unambiguous, and helps the questioner himself/herself eventually in getting a response sooner.
