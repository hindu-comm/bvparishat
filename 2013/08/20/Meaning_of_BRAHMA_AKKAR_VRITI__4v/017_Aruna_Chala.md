Thank you, all of you, for your postings and clarifications on Brahma Akkar Vriti, Brahmakara Vritti.

  

I have learned a tremendous amount and my questions are answered.

  

All of you had points to make and I received them.

  

And yes, Poonjaj, who left his body in 1997, grew up in Punjab, Pakistan, (in a little Brahman enclosure) before Independence, and Urdu and Punjabi were his first languages. Hindi, Tamil, Marathi, Kannada, a little Sanskrit, and English came later, so his spelling of words may be, at times, a little different. Which is one reason I asked the question in the first place, for clarification at the start.

  

Mr. Sivakumar, yes, this is the last step before the merging of the Vritti into Brahman, itself.Thank you.This is what gave me the confusion, as Poonjaji's was already merged and his writing was of That nature, not the intellectual meaning of the Brahmakara Vritti.

  

And Mr. Subrahmanian, thank you so much for putting it in order. As I mentioned above, the merging of the Vritti into Brahman, itself, I knew as the last step, but the "Vritti" itself, as being the mental process, I needed clarification, as Poonjaji's Brahma Akkar Vriti meaning was the last one, of the merging of the Vritti into Brahman, itself.

  

Thank you all.

This question is now complete.
