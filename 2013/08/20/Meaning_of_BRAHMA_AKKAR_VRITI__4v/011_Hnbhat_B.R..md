So after all, you were asking for the source of the usage of your own Guru and wanted to discuss the terminology with the scholars of this forum.

  

Only one question remains from me:

  

If you know it is for certain, the usage is of your own Guru, why could you not first asked your guruji for its explanation? And instead, why to make others confused with the explanations you found on the web?

It was a direct method and why to take a round about way? Just like your Guru, all the other teachers of Philosophy have their own explanations on the Realization of Brahman, whether you follow Bhakti, or Jnana or both.
