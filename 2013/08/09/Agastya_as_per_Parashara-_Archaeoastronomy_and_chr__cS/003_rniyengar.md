The revised final version of my work appeared recently in the Ind. J of History of Science. Please see attachment. I hope those curious to know the type of sky observations (Vaidika-Jyotisha) that existed before the Siddhantic astronomy period (that is before the 12 raashis, mesha, vrshabha etc came into vogue) will find the publication interesting.

Best...
