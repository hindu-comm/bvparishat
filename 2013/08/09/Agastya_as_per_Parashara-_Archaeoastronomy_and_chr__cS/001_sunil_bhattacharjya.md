Dear friends,

  

In case you have gone through Abhyankar's paper (which is given as a reference in RNI's paper) you would have seen that the star "Agastya" was visible in the Tamilnadu region after about 8,500 BCE. You may also be aware that Agastya is believed to have advised Lord Ram to pray to Lord Sun by reciting the "Adityahrdayam" three times before fighting with Ravana. This means that event has to be dated after 8,500 BCE and thus this sets the upper limit to the date of Ramayana as 8,500 BCE. However there are other evidences which put the date of Ramayana around 6,000 to 7,000 BCE.

  

Now coming to the period of visibility of Agastya in the Northern India and Agastya's crossing the Vindhya from the North to the South it could therefore mean that Agastya visited North and while returning to the South he removed the Vindhya-barrier.

  

Regards,

Sunil KB
