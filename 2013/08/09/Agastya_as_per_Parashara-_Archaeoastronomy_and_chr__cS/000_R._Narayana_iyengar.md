Dear friends,

Ancient chronolgy of India is of interest to several of us. But the data available are few and far apart. I am attaching herewith a pre-print of my recent paperParāśara’s Seasonal Solar Zodiac and Heliacal Visibility of Star Agastya in Second Millennium BCE.

This might be of interest to some of you. Please don't hesitate to reply if you feel either the Sanskrit text or the analysis has not been handled within reasonable bounds of doubts.

Sincerely,  
R.N.Iyengar
