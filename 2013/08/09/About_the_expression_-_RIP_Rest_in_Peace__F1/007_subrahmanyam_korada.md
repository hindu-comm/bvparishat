नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

विद्वान् सलील् कुल्कर्णि --

  

"But is this also in line with our ancient Indian (Hindu?) philosophy and our traditional system of belief? If not, what should be the apt wording to express the similar feelings towards the dead, in tune with our system of belief? Kindly give the appropriate expression in Sanskrit and English "

  

-- बाणभट्ट in कादम्बरी (महाश्वेतावृत्तान्त) says the following about अनुमरणम् (सती - भ्रातृ - मित्र - सहगमनम्) -

  

(यदेतदनुमरणम् नाम ) तदतिनिष्फलम् , अविद्वज्ज्नाचरित एष मार्गः , मोहविलसितमेतत् , अज्ञातपद्धतिरियम् ....।

  

The above lines are applicable to saying ' may his soul rest in peace' .

I fail to understand as to how senior scholars also recite this --

  

take it for granted - there is neither birth nor death - one who learnt Vedanta should not trust in either - it is just changing the उपाधि (in Vedanta and not Panini) -

  

जीर्णानि वस्त्राणि यथा विहाय नवानि गृह्णाति नरो’पराणि ।

  

जातस्य हि ध्रुवो मृत्युः ध्रुवं जन्म मृतस्य च ।

तस्मादपारिहार्ये’र्थे न त्वं शोचितुमर्हति ॥ (गीताचार्यः)

  

If you claim that there is 'peace'(शान्तिः) to 'soul'(आत्मा ?) then there should be ’ disturbance'(अशान्तिः) also !

  

I discussed with people of all the three denominations - catholic , protestant and seventh day adventist - none of them could explain 'soul' , much less ' salvation '.

  

आप्नोति = व्याप्नोति इति आत्मा -it is निर्गुण etc.

  

'अर्थं बुद्ध्वा शब्दरचना’ - is the norm , but people are carried out by passion or it can be due to inferiority complex ( may be लग्नाधिपति is in नीच).

  

गतानुगतिको लोको न लोकः पारमार्थिकः ।

गङ्गासैकतलिङ्गेन नष्टं ताम्रभजनम् ॥

  

परामर्शः -

  

except on Tuesday , Friday (and Sunday also- according to some) .

  

One would just pay a visit and does not say anything and people may console the inmates.

  

The near and dear , including Sisyas , would offer तिलाञ्जलि on tenth day .

  

Beyond that relatives and Sisyas would offer regular तर्पणम् ।

  

Death of any person can be reported .

  

A composed Vedavyasa tells weeping Pandavas - 'he (Srikrsna) completed his duty and left ' .

  
धन्यो’स्मि
