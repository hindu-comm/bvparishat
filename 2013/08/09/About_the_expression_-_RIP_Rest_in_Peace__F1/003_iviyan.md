Dear Scholar friends,

praNamyA. As far as I know and recollect there is no practice of keeping any board or any stone with writings on it that

the departed soul should rest in peace for ever, in our Indian ancient customs.We keep abreast the principles of the departed

souls and try to implement them in our life as a token of our gratitude to them for their services if any rendered to the mankind at large.As regards the departed kings there were statues erected in memory of them in the back-yards of their forts.We see them even today behind the forts like those at Vizianagaram in Andhra Pradesh all-over India where there were

erstwhile princely states.On the boards or stones the memorable services of the departed and their titles were enlisted wishing them heavenly abode in Sanskrit or any local language they liked..

Regards,

Iviyan.
