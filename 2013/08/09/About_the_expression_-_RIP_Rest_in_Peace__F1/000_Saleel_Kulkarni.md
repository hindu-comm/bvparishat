Respected Scholars,

Namo namah.

We often use the sentence 'May God rest his/her soul in peace' wishing eternal rest and peace to someone who has died. I understand that this sentence typically appears on headstones at the grave of Catholics. But is this also in line with our ancient Indian (Hindu?) philosophy and our traditional system of belief? If not, what should be the apt wording to express the similar feelings towards the dead, in tune with our system of belief? Kindly give the appropriate expression in Sanskrit and English.

Thanks.
