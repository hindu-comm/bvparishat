I think the appropriate expression would be: स सद्गतिं प्राप्नुयात् ।
\[May he / she attain a good/noble state\] There are various ways in which such statements are made as per different traditions/followings:  
  
1. स शिवलोकमवाप \[He / she reached shivaloka\]

  
  
२. तस्य वैकुण्ठप्राप्तिमभवत् \[He / she attained vaikunTha \]  
  

३. स आचार्यश्रीचरणमवाप This is used by srivaishnavites (followers of Sri Ramanuja). In Tamil it reads: ..AchAryAn tiruvaDi aDaindAr. It means: the departed soul has reached the holy feet of the Acharya Sri Ramanuja. The belief is that once this has happened, the soul's attaining VaikunTha is not in doubt.
