Namaste,

  

 If not aware, than<http://sourceforge.net/projects/sandic/>is a quite promising Russian software. Someday it might include the bulk of<http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/>. If one only could import the data from outdated software like<http://www.taralabalu.org/panini/>

Tarabalu's software loads an eternity, but has a valuable Renou's French translation of Panini.

  

From Russia with Love,
