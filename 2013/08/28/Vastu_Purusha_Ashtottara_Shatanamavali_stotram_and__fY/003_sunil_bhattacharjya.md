Namaste Sadasivamurtyji,  
  

Thank you for your reply. The Vyapakata of the Vastupurusha as stated in a part of the first verse you sent (i.e., व्याप्यमानं शरीरेण स्कलं भुवनं तत:॥) fits in well with the etymological meaning of the word "Vishnu" and even of the word "Brahman". As regards the words "Asura" and "Sura" both of these also have been applied in case of Vishnu. May be that is why some scholars might have tried to interpret the Vishnu purusha as Lord Vishnu. To my knowledge the pratima of the Vastu purusha is made the same as that of Lord Vishnu. There is a practice in some quarters to bury a pratima of the Vastupurusha (in gold) in the vastu before constructing one's house, partricularly while making a house in an unknown area,  
  
Kindly correct me if you think differently.  
  

Regards,  

Sunil KB
