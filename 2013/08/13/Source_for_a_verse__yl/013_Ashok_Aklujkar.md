Dear Prof. Jha,

  

You probably did not notice that in the verse as cited by Prof. Wakankar the first word in the first paada was Dhaaraadharaan\*aam(with a long vowel in the first syllable, which is different from the first word of the second paada). I am sure as a professor of Sanskrit you know that dhaaraadhara can mean 'cloud' and dharaadhara can mean 'mountain'. If there is some other difficulty that I failed to perceive, please specify what it is.

  

a.a.

  

\*This should ne N or .n (a retroflex n) here as well as in the second paada.
