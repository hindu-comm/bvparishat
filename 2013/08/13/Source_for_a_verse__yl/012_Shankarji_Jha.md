Speechless thanks for the fondly hearing from you. I did not talk about the verse of Prof. Vakankara. I am talking about the verse posted by my
Revered Big Brother, Prof. Madhava Deshpande 'Payodharaanaam (meghaanaam) kila vristipaatah payodharaanaam (parvataanaam)
shikhareshu poorvam', on which a scholar had suggested a correct reading (dharaadharaanaam---) I posted for your consideration. With best regard, Sincerely,

  
Shankarji Jha,  
Professor of Sanskrit,  
Deptt of Sanskrit,

Dear Prof. Jha,

  

You probably did not notice that in the verse as cited by Prof. Wakankar the first word in the first paada was Dhaaraadharaan\*aam(with a long vowel in the first syllable, which is different from the first word of the second paada). I am sure as a professor of Sanskrit you know that dhaaraadhara can mean 'cloud' and dharaadhara can mean 'mountain'. If there is some other difficulty that I failed to perceive, please specify what it is.

  

a.a.

  

\*This should ne N or .n (a retroflex n) here as well as in the second paada.
