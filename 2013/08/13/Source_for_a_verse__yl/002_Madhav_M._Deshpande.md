Dear Prof. Jha,  
  
 In the verse as it was sent to me, one of the meanings of payodhara must be "mountain", though I have not come across such a usage of this word elsewhere. That is why I suspect that the original verse may have a different reading. Perhaps, it is possible to have the word payodhara in the sense of parvata, if we understand it to refer to that fact that many rivers like Ganga originate in the mountains.
