The verse is nice, but I would expect a causal form ;samayitu.m or ;saamayitu.m in the place of the intransitive ;samitum. However, the metre cannot accommodate either causal form. The only alternative then is to rewrite the whole last paada. In such rewriting, na nadya.h should not be changedas far as possible, because it balances na diinaa.h in paada 2 and adds the necessary force or emphasis to the last paada. I would suggest that that paada should be recast as davaarti-;saanti-prabhavo, na nadya.h. (Alternative suggestions welcome.)

  

If the verse is ancient, my defence would be puraa.nam ity eva na saadhu sarvam. And if Mahima-bha.t.ta did not hesitate to correct even Kaali-daasa, why should we not seek possibilities of improving upon any inherited text (of course, only after alerting the reader that this is what we are doing)? We need such a free exercise of critical spirit if the Sanskrit tradition is to remain robust and thrive.
