It is not the first word, but second word.

  

As Valenkar suggested, the reading is perfect and reads:

  

  

*Dhaaraadharaanaam* kila vrushtipatah *Dharaadharaanaam* shikhareshu poorvam/

Tathaiva..........

  

***धाराधराणां***किल वृष्टिपातो***धराधराणां***शिखरेषु पूर्वम्।

तथैव यूनां किल दृष्टिपातः पयोधराणां शिखरेषु पूर्वम्।

  

in Devanagari, the remaining as given by M Deshapande. Here the meaning is crystal clear without resorting to any etymological meaning to get the meaning desired.  
  
I think there is no need for further consultation on the meaning of the two words. For the first, it is in the Amara listed as synonym of मेघ:  
  
  
( १. ३. १८८) अभ्रं मेघो वारिवाहः स्तनयित्नुर्बलाहकः ।।१-३-६।।  
( १. ३. १८९)***धाराधरो***जलधरस्तडित्वान् वारिदोऽम्बुभृत्  
( १. ३. १९०) घनजीमूतमुदिरजलमुग्धूमयोनयः ।।१-३-७।।  
  
  
And the second is confirmed by Medini, which also confirms the first meaning, also  

  

"धराधरो हरौ***शैले***धाराधरोऽसि***मेघयोः***।"

  

The above is confirmed by usages

  

सुमेधा मेधजो धन्यः सत्यमेधाधराधरः\| in VishnuSahasranama,  

  

and alsoदंष्त्रयाभ्युज्जहारैनामात्माधारोधराधरः// KUrmP 1,6।9 //

  

meaning Vishnu and meaning पर्वत

  

सिषिञ्चिरे प्रोषितचन्दनान् स्तनान् धराधरःप्रस्रवणैरे र् इवोपलान् // 8।26 //  

  



And also in the verse quoted by Prof. S. Kannan:

  

०२५९-  

१*तुङ्गात्मनः*तुङ्गतराः समर्था मनोरुजं ध्वंसयितुं न नीचाः ।  

***धाराधरा एव धराधराणां ***निदाघदावौघहरा न नद्यः ।\|  

  

as found in सुभाषितावली of वल्लभदेव both the first meaning clouds and the second mountains. The same applies here as quoted by Wallenkar, without any difficulty, to the context also without resorting to any etymologically fetched meaning like पयोधर to mean mountain. It may somehow made to mean a mountain, but popular usage is to mean a cloud and breast of women (whether milking or otherwise). Though it has got multiple meaning, doesn't mean a mountain as per Medini,

  

पयोधरः कोशकारे नालिकेरे*स्तनेऽपि*च।

कशेरु-*मेघयोः पुंसि*... ... ... ... ... ... रेफान्तवर्ग २५९.

(p.405 and 407)

  

  

With regards
