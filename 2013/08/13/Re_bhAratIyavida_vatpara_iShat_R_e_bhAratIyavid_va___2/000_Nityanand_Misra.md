I am afraid it is you who is unnecessarily getting worked up in defending an incorrect explanation which has already been contradicted by Sh. Nambudiri. We all make mistakes, if you do not want to admit you made one, please go ahead but do not call others' arguments unnecessary.

  

If at all the the questioner should know about Asiddhatva, he should know that Asiddhatva does not apply in this case, irrespective of whether 8-4-45 is applied to padaanta or not. In this light, my further explanation is quite necessary IMHO.
