Dear ALL,  
  
This is for your research reference attached current contents of the below said book  
  
  

**Living Rock: Buddhist, Hindu and Jain Cave Temples in the Western Deccan** ![](https://groups.google.com/group/bvparishat/attach/cd3f30eaac23bea6/?part=0.0.1.1)

Edited byPia Brancaccio

The rock-cut caves of the Western Deccan are among the regionâ€™s most important art and architectural heritage. These constructions took place between the 2nd century bce and the 8th century ce. Despite the time span and multiple causes for fragmentation, the artistic development over time was almost continuous, thus allowing us to appreciate the exquisite sculpture and painting, as well as new ideas in the layouts of temples.

  
Thanks
