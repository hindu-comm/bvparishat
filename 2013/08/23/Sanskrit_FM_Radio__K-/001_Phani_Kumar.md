Namaste. A small clarification. What has been started at Pondy is an internet radio not an FM station. That said, it is a pioneering attempt by SAFIC to popularise sanskrit through this media. This is how available technology can be pressed into the cause of samskrit. Dr.Sampadananda Mishraji and his team deserve compliments from all of us.
