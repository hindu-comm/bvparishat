Dear scholars,  
 Is printed copy of the southern recension of Harivamsa in devanagari available? The only printed copy of the southern recension of Harivamsa available to the editor of BORI Critical Edition was in grantha lipi. My knowledge of the materials in southern recension comes only from the appendices in the BORI edition (Volume 2)  
 I am also interested to know if there is any attempt to prepare an electronic version of the southern recension of Harivamsa.  
.  
Sincerely  
Harindranath
