Sarvebhyo Namaha  
  
I have a doubt on the agnihotra.  How Srautagni first time after marriage is kindled ? I have read three different things in different places.  
  
1. The wikipedia says Srautagni agni should be divided from aupasana agni.  
  
" ***The Aupasana Agni, lit at the time of the Yajna conducted at the grooms wedding, is divided into two in a ritual called Agnyadhana. One part is called the Grhyagni and the other the Srautagni*** "  
  
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yajna>  
  
2. Some places they say that the garhapatya agani ( Srautagni ) should be produced from arani manthana.  
  
3. Some places they say that it should be brought from a Vaishya house.  
  
Please clarify me ( if possible according to Ashwalayana or Aapastamba ) Also give references if possible.  
  
Thanks  
Narayan
