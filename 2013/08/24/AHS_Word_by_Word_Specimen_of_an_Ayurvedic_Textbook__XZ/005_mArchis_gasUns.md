Namonamah, Dr. Nair,

  

 Sent you an email. So as shown in the screenshot above I can prepare the whole book in a few days. Than it would take months if not years fixing, adding what's wrong. Strange that there never came out a word by word translation like Gita has. An Ayurvedic dictionary in Malayalam makes me sweat, oh my, I can master the script, but not the language I guess now when I'm 30 years old.
