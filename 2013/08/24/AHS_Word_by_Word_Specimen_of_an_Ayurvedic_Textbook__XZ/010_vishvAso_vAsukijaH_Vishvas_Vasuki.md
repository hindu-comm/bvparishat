Thanks for your suggestion marcis. Speaking for my part of the world, hindu-s/ Indians \[\*\]: I strongly disagree that translating Sanskrit texts to English is a worthy goal. Instead, I and several others are enabling people to decolonize their Anglicized minds, read Sanskrit texts in their original, and speak/ write in Sanskrit.

  

\[\*\] It may still be desirable from the perspective of non Indian English speakers - but it is for them to decide.
