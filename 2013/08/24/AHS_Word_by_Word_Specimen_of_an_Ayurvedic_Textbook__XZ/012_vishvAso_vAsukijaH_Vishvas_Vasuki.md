Not at all. What I mean is "Translating sanskrit texts to English is not necessarily a worthy goal for \*Indians\*." No comment on what a worthy goal for a non-Indian such as yourself is.

pANini taught Sanskrit grammar in Sanskrit. Teaching Sanskrit in Sanskrit is a different thing (which is how it must be done - the English medium way of calling lit case "past perfect" etc.. is a joke.).

  

Do Russian children learn Russian by memorizing grammar rules first or by using the language?

  

I haven't mastered a single pAda of the aShTAdhyAyI, let alone its entirety. But I don't have much trouble reading the following juicy plastic surgery exerpt from the sushuta-samhitaa -

  

विश्लेषितायास्त्वथ नासिकाया

वक्षामि सन्धानविधिं यथावत्।

नासाप्रमाणं पृथिवीरुहाणां

पत्रं गृहीत्वा त्ववलम्बितस्य॥

तेन प्रमाणेन हि गण्डपार्श्वाद्

उदुत्कृत्य बद्धं त्वथ नासिकाग्रम्।

विलिख्य चाशु प्रतिसंदधीत

तत् साधुबन्धैर्भिषगप्रमत्तः॥

  

Firstly, this is in a pair of verses whose metres belong to the triShTubh class (first being indravajrA, sencond being an upajAtI). And, I realize thatsome words may be pAribhAShika ( jargon specific to the ayurveda shAstra), so the actual meaning may be slightly more different. For this and more I am generally not in favor of shallow translation (not only are aesthetic beauty and shades of meaning lost, the illusion of understanding is generated in the anglophone ).

Now that is strange to hear. Why would you think that Indians would not use the excellent work of German people?? I have used<http://sanskrit.sai.uni-heidelberg.de/Chanda/src/formChanda.py/searchChanda>over 300 times in the past few months to check my verses. Occasionally I use the digital corpus of sanskrit too.

  

Thanks for letting me know about the shabda-kalpadruma digitization! I am excited by it - I am sick of using dictionaries which don't tell me the grammatical rules behind the derivation of words (again that may be something sufficient for aliens who don't want to make Sanskrit \_their\_ language, not for people like me).

Non-Indian books, I would say. Of course there are Indians who don't agree with me so there may be other dictionary type books from India.
