Some suggestions

A word-by-word translation is expected to be precise and accurate. For most words, I see that some or all of the dictionary meanings are listed without examining for the context. Examples -

-   अथ - The meanings given include "but" and "certainly". In this
    context, the meaning is neither of them. The meaning of अथ as in the
    beginning many texts is अधिकार (authorized teaching) - as clarified
    by Patanjali in Mahabhashya - अथेत्ययं शब्दोऽधिकारार्थः प्रयुज्यते।
    शब्दानुशासनं नाम शास्त्रमधिकृतं वेदितव्यम्.  
-   व्याख्यास्यामः - means "we will expound upon or explain". The
    meaning of only the root is given, not the conjugated form. In this
    context, the root meaning of "to call" is not correct.  
-   द्रवद्रव्यविज्ञानीयम् means "having the science of fluids".
    Translating it as "a name of chapter of AHS" is not accurate and
    hardly helpful to the reader.

Compounds (समास) should not be split in word by word meanings. The meaning of a compound is different from the meanings of constituents. Separate translation of the two words in the compound does not make any sense.Examples -

-   आत्रेयादयः should be translated as "the likes of Atreya". Instead,
    आत्रेय is translated separately and आदि separately. A meaning of
    "chyle" is given for आत्रेय which is out of place and context.  
-   महा is shown as an indeclinable (it is an adjective to be precise)
    and meaning is given as "gross" which is wrong. Gross means "total"
    or "unattractively large" in English unlike the similar sounding
    German word. The meaning of ऋषि as "a hymn or Mantra composed by a
    si" is wrong, and meaning or "a ray of light" is wrong in this
    context.The compound महर्षयः should instead be translated as "the
    great sages".

For inflected bases the gender (male, female, neuter), case (one of the seven vibhaktis) and number (singular, dual, plural) may be indicated. E.g. महर्षयः \[महर्षि, m, 1.3\] to show masculine nominative plural.  

For conjugated verbs the root, the tense (the 10 lakaaras), person (first/second/thid) and number (singular, dual, plural) may be indicated. E.g. व्याख्यास्यामः \[व्या √ख्यालृट्3.3\] to show simple future tense, first person, plural.

After the word-by-word translation, anअन्वय (paraphrasing) andprose translation of the entire verse would be helpful.

The original verse may be written without breaking the Sandhis, as you are already giving a word for word translation.

If meant for print publication, font size may be increased. If only for digital publication, it is fine as the users can zoom in.

German and English meanings are mixed up at some places, e.g. "eine Essenszeit \| the proper time or season for". Might be better to show German meanings in a different colour and English meanings in a different colour.
