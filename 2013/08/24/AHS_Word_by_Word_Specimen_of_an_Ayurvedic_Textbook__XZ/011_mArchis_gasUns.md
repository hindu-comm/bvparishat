Yes, that's the pity. It remains only mine.

Oh, ok. That's a new point of view. So I guess you think German is a better idea. I shall agree, indeed.

<http://ayurvedam.ru/carakasamhita-wordby-word/> - will have to think about a fully German edition.  

Next comes Susruta. After that Ramayana - for an Indian friend of mine from Bangalore.

How? One cannot do better as has done Panini teaching Sanskrit in Sanskrit.

Strange to hear. I see that even<http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/SKDScan/2013/web/index.php>is of no interest in India, because a German scholar is the first to make aSabda-kalpadruma (2013 edition) digital. So what's left tonon-Indian English speakers? non-Indian books? Or is the oral translation that which does not gives a chance to see a new Sanskrit dictionary coming from India?
