Namaste,

  

 It took me two weeks to compile a better edition of the initial file. Sorry for the late reply, wanted to show, not only to tell about what I'm doing right now. The whole AHS is ready, almost 3000 pages. I'm afraid it will get 7000 pages with Sanskrit commentaries and paraphrases. Now the improvements can start. I hope I will get at least one Sanskrit or Ayurveda helper, or I'll close this interlinear translation project soon. Murthy's text will be added. Does anyone know biography of Murthy, one of the few AHS translators?

I give you my thanks for such a detailed review. Many things I agree, but am unable to do alone. So I agree and disagree at the same time. What we have is the first attempt. It has no analogues. I know the next hundred steps how it could become a great book, but without help from my Indian friends and colleagues - impossible.

Yes and no. After speaking with<https://www.facebook.com/hendrik.wiethase>and realizing it's 6.5 years work to compile even a translation (not a as detailed as word by word), I'm not sure we're on the same page. The initial attempt is to generate a text. Generate - it's not to write by hand. Generate based on MW, right as it is on DSC. It's not as good as the original MW, but I'm aware of most of the issues <http://samskrtam.ru/dsc-bugs/>

Meanings as now are ordered by Latin alphabet, which is a shame, but a DSC shame. If fixable, I'll fix. But could take half a year or so.

You dive too deep. What you do is manual editing. I don't have a manual editor. I mean I adore what you do, but it looks nice to do as a specimen, but impossible to do for the whole text. No one will undertake a thing like that. The only text that has such a commentary is the Gita.

The meaning of the conjugated form will never be there. The best I could do is adding the structure of verbal form. So all I can do is add the default root meaning. Making an index of prefix+roots would fix it at some point, but still - need advice from a vyakarana guru.

That's an issue that can't be fixed easily. I'm aware of it and fully agree. It'c accurate, but not helpful at all. It's because MW has such an entry. The only way to fix it - add "real" translations for all headers, titles and chapters of AHS.

As now - impossible. Yes, a good point. But possible if only done once manually.

Actually this case is not us problematic, as the meaning can be gathered from the parts.

As above.

With some % of mistakes possible to do in the next months.

Technically possible, but very time consumable. Would need advice and help in reordering my digital dhatupatha.

Sure, everybody would agree. Work is starting on OCRing Murthy's translation.

No, it will stay as it is. No real need and it would take months to do that.

It's meant for print. No need to increase, it's 15 pt devanagari - big enough. Or no?

Might be. Impossible to do it without manual markup. So no, this is not in the priority list.

  

This review is a detailed one, I see your great knowledge and respect it. Only a pity the .pdf will remain digital for ages.
