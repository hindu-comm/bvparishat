विश्वासो, these are great texts, interesting links. 1st one I've seen before, the 2nd one - can't remember. But what I speak about is not just 1-2 texts (big or small). I speak about hundreds of texts, a parallel text corpus. So these URLs could be a good basis for that and in many ways they are interesting, but I don't want to have 20 websites open to look how a word has been translated. That is the starting point of<http://sandic.ru/en/downloads>as well.

 I'm working on the basic tools to start making a corpora for Russian translations of Sanskrit texts. But there is no one to deal with the English texts. That's a pity.<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_Sanskrit_Library>was a step in that direction, but it ceased to be.विश्वासो - it's you to change the world. Your part of the world.
