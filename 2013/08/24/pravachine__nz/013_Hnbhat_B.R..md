If you are referring to the text of सिद्धान्तकौमुदी, the context is this which has to be taken in the context of the discussion. 



  

"अकोऽकि दीर्घ इत्येव सुवचम्"

  

And now if your question is regarding the word सुवचम् - it is very simple and need not any elaborate laborious effort like प्रचच. "3305)ईषद्दुःसुषु कृच्छ्राकृच्छार्थेषु खल्  3-3-126" explains the word, सुखेन उच्यते इति or वक्तुं शक्यम् इति सुवचम् as per the सिद्धान्तकौमुदी itself. It is prescribed only before ईषद्दुःसुषु as उपपद and is different from प्रवच.

  

As for the प्रवच as explained by Nityananda Mishra, as भावे अच्, the suffix is restricted to verbs ending in इ only as per ३. ३. ५६ एरच् । and the other possibility is अप् which is specifically for others ending in vowels३. ३. ५७ ॠदोरप् । ॠ, and उ. Our verb वच् does not fall into both these. The verbs to which other verbs ending in consonants, they are limited to those specified in the sUtra-s following 57 up to३. ३. ८७ निघः नीमितं । with different prefixes and those specified in the sUtras. The only other way is to derive it from ब्रूञ् व्यक्तायां वाचि, which comes under the second one उवर्णान्त and takesब्रुवो बचिः २।४।५३ and now it can take अप्, and give प्रवच if wants to be justified. And probably not directly from the consonant ending verb वच परिभाषणे prefixed with प्र. वच्=अ० अनिट् प० \| वच परिभाषणे २. ५८.
