How do we explain Akoki ityeva SUVACHAM, in Koumudi?  
  
This also reminds me an old adage quoted by our Guru Sri T Viswanatha Sarma.  
Praayena Vaiakaranaah Pishaachah (Apashabda Vishaye Pishitam Achanti/ Icchanti?)  
PrayogenopaShaamyanti.  
Until you provide a reference to an authentic source Grammarians are unlikely to tolerate a violation or an attempt/reference.  
  
By the way, if we deem Pravachine is the derivative of Pavacha+Ini; then the meaning would be not one who speaks, but the one who has him.  
Salutation to the spirited debate. Subham.
