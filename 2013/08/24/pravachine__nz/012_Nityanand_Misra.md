Here is the Mahabhashya on 3-2-78 (translation and notes mine).

  

Bhashya: **supi iti vartamāne punaḥ subgrahaṇam kimartham** .

Translation: When "supi" \[already\] exists, what is the purpose of the mention of "supi" \[again\]?

Note: The already existing "supi" is carried over from 3-2-4 supi sthaḥ.

  

Bhashya: **anupasarge iti evam tat abhūt** .

Translation: That \["supi" from 3-2-4\] was only limited to "anupasarge" (non-prefix cases).

Note: Why does Patanjali say "that supi was limited to anupasarge"? Since it was further qualified by explicit use of "upasarge" in 3-2-61 satsūdviṣadruhaduhayujavidabhidacchidajinīrājāmupasarge'pi kvip‌)

  

Bhashya: **idam submātre yathā syāt** .

Translation: So that this "supi" (in 3-2-78) stands for all "sup".

Note: By "submātra", Patanjali means both the entire set of "sup", i.e. both "upsarge supi" and "anupasarge supi".

  

Therefore the reading of "supi" in 3-2-78 is to discontinue the Anuvritti of the old "supi" which was limited to "anupasarge supi" as denoted by Acharya in 3-2-61. This is why Bhattoji rejects the interpretation in Kashika and calls it as going against the Bhashya.
