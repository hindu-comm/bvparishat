I think you know Sanskrit and declination of numerals from eka to  
catur. If you know then there is no need for emendation.  
  
  
Anyhow for your information, चतुर्षु is the correct form in the  
locative case of the numeral चतुर् in the masculine gender and there  
is no such form as चतृषु for the word, as you can see in the  
manuscript and no need to change it. But it can be चतसृषु in the  
feminine gender. So any correction should be context based depending  
on the gender of the noun it relates and you cannot find the declined  
forms in any dictionary for all the words.\\
