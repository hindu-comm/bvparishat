Can you cite the usage (full sentence, name of work, etc)? Also, can you cite where you saw the word to be used? A Google search led me to only Wikipedia articles (non-reliable source) and Digital Sanskrit Buddhist Canon (which uses Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit, not Paninian).  
  
It could be a scribal error for चतुर्षु or the feminine चतसृषु.

You meant "emend it as चतुर्षु". Yes, if there is no change of meaning (which is why the sentence or the context will need to be looked at).
