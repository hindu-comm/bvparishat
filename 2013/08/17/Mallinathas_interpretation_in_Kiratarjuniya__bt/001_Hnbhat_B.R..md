I think not. The text is correct and is justified by both the maxims governing the active and passive voice of the द्विकर्मकधातु.

  

If you have read both the maxims, please put the same construction in कर्मणि and कर्तरि लकारः and you will get the exact.

  

I could not understand your doubt at all, though could understand Mallinatha's explanation.

  

With regards
