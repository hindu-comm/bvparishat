Namaste.  

Here are my humble suggestions-  
  
***Hello and Hi-*** namaste, namaskAram, namAmi, namAMsi, vandanaM, vandanAni, praNAmaH, aBhivAdanaM, abhivAdaye.

  

***Bye Bye-  
***General- Subhamastu, Subham bhUyAt, Sivamastu  

If speaking to younger ones, then AShIH, vRddhirastu, vardhatAM, would look decent at the end of conversation.  

When speaking to elders- pAdasparSaH, again, abhivAdanaM or something similar will look good.  
  
Do not know about Hello, but "Bye", as I read, is the short form of "Good Bye" which again is short of "God be with you."  

So "ISvarAnugraha-prAptirastu", or "siddhirastu" - such kinds of usages could be apt.
