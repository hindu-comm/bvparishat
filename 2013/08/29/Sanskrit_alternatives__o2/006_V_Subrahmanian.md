I think 'ayi' will be apt.  

\[Pl. see Apte Sanskrit - English dictionary for this word अयि for some kAvya references of this usage.  

  
'Arya' or 'AryA' will also be fine for 'hello', depending on the gender being addressed.   
  

Since in the school most students will be addressing each other, the word सखि / सख will be appropriate.  
  

Here are two extra expressions, most used:  
  
In the modern usage we have 'Have a nice day'. This can be rendered in Sanskrit, on the basis of the srIrudra (chamakapashna) mantra expression: 'sUShA cha mE', 'sudinam cha mE' as 'sudinam bhUyAt/astu'.
'Good morning' can take the form of 'suprabhAtam'.
