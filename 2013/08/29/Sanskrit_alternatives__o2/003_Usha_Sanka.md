Some more-  
1. for **Hello**-  

Especially for Elders- nato'smi, praNato'smi, vandehaM, paraNamAmi  

General- namo namaH  

  
2. for **Bye-**  
bhadram te  

(It is used in vAlmIki rAmAyaNa- though in certain other contexts also.. but may be it can be used here as well.)  

  
(In our culture, elders do not say, "namaste" to younger ones. They just receive it and utter the blessing. Otherwise, it is considered as AyukShINam.  
And while parting, elders say the blessings, and younger ones just receive with folded hands and head bent. May be younger ones can say- dhanyo'smi / dhanyAsmi or kRtArtho'smi / kRtArthAsmi or anugRhIto'smi / anugRhItAsmi in return of their blessings.)  

  

Do not know whether these are apt for the modern day exchanging of greetings.  

-Usha
