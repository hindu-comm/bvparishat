I have heard that in the Mahabharatha is a narrative of Kunti, as a young girl, having served Sage Durvasa, geting a boon, a mantra, from him. She later used that boon/mantra and begot sons like Karna.  
  

A person who has been told that this mantra is in the Atharva veda, wants to know what the mantra is, that is, its textual form.  
  

Anyone aware of this may pl. help with the form of the mantra-text.
