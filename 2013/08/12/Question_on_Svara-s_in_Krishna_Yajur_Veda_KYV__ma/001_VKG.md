Dear Krishnan

  

Swaras are tricky issue for scholars or researchers. The position (Higher/ lower) is relative.

Swarita as it is uttered these days, does not seem to be extremely compatible to the principles of Lakshana (Vyakarana/ Siksha). More research and practical experiments with modern gadgets would fast track the process of finding the precision.

  

As such, we all accept the current practices, though we are convinced that it might not be perfect.

Regards

VKG
