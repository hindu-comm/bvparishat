In kerala, they start "i shey tvaa..."from lower pitch and go up to make udaatha and take a right turn so that to come in between the previous two for making svaritha.For this they have "svaritha: karnamooleeya:" (Panineeyasiksha).Whereas, Karnatakates,Tamiliyans and Andhrates start"i"lower,then go "shey"  
up and again go up to get svaritha for "tvaa".But actually avowel happens to falleither udatta or anudaatta or svaritha internally. Not externally.So we can neglect the action of hands or heads during the accentuation. Ofcourse, the actionof hands and head play an important influence on the correct falling of vowels.An expertcan make these three without any movements of either head or hands. In paninisiksha , the movement of hands accordingly is appreciated and that of head is not. This isto avoidamal-influence of head-movement in the correct falling of svara. At the same time , hand-movement is necessary to get an awareness of one's own accent. Moreover,ucchairudaatta etc are just an explanation on it, the very sound changes are not flexible to beexplaned.The guru-parampara is the only last word.This is my conclusionon the context.
