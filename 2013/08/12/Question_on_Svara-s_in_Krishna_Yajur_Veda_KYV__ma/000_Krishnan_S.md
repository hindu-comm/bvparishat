***My Current Understanding***: While learning KYV prsna-s, we are introduced to three Svara-s (Anudaatta, Udatta & Svarita). We are informed that Anudatta refers to 'lower' pitch, Udatta to slightly ;higher' pitch and Svarita to still a higher pitch.

  

Also we came across an article ('A Monograph on the Svara-s of Taittiriya Krsna Yajur Veda by Shri. Sriramana Sharma) wich states that Anudatta is weak svara and equal to 'Rishaba' of musical scale, Udatta is equal to 'Gandhara" and Svarita is equal to 'Panchama'. This also confirms that as we move from Anudatta, through Udatta to Svarita , we ascend from lower pitch to higher and the to still higher pitch

  

*My recent Observation*But Panini's Sutra-s (1.2.29, 1.2.30, 1.2.31) mention that 'UccaiH UdattaH, 'NeecaiH AnudattaH' & SamahaaraH SvaritaH'). In Taittiriya Praatisaakhya also we come across the same as Sutra-s (1.38, 1.39 & 1.40). What do they mean? Do they imply that Svarita's pitch lies in between Anudatta & Udatta.

  

*My Question* My observation seems to be in conflict with my understanding. I am sure that I am missing something. Requesting the erudite members of the e-group to enlighten me

  

Thanks

  

Krishnan
