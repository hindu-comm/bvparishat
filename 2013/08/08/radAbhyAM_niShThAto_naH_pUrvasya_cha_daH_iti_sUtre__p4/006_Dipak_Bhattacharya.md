I think you are unnecessarily arguing. The question originally raised indicates new entry into the prakriya process. Hence all doubts have to be removed. There was no point in not raising the asiddhatva vicaara with which the questioner might not have been acquainted. Let him know that sometimes asiddhatva vicaara too is involved. The correspondence should not continue anymore I think.
