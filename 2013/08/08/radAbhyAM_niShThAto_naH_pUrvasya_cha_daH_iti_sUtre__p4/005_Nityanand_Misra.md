Not quite, seems you have confused the order of operations and the order in Tripadi.

  

Even if one were to ignore the Padanta condition, or assume that the domain of 8-4-45 is extended to Apadanta also, Asiddha argument does not hold good. The concept of Asiddhatva pertains to the situation when an earlier Sutra in Tripadi comes into play after the operation of a later Sutra in the Tripadi.

  

Even if we assume for a moment that "padaantasya" from 8-4-37 is not carried into 8-4-45 (e.g. by "ma.n.duukapluti"), the precondition for 8-4-45 is not met in the case of "chid + ta" since "ta" does not begin with an anunaasika. The precondition for 8-2-42 is however met. Therefore 8-2-42 will apply before 8-4-45 and so the question of Assiddhatva of 8-4-45 does not arise at all in this derivation. Sh. Vishnu Namboodiri is correct in saying असिद्धत्वमिति तु न युक्तं समाधानम्, whether one takes "padaantasya" into 8-4-45 or not.

  

I am travelling and cannot currently type in Devanagari.
