I am sorry for disagreeing with Sarvesh Kumar Mishra ji.  
Arya metre's traditional style of recitation is very beautiful one. Arya Dvisati known to have been written by the sage Durvasa in praise of the Goddess Lalitamba is in Arya metre only and it has a very beautiful style of recitation.  
I shall try to upload the the style of recitation of this metre by tomorrow as the <http://vocaroo.com/> is not working in my system I shall find some other means and upload by tomorrow.  

  
With warm regards,  

**Dr. Rani Sadasiva Murty**
