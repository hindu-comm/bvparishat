Swasti, Speechless thanks to Vidvan Jagannath for singing me (over Telephone) the correct and exact pronouncing of Arya Verse in his most elegant and melodious voice. I think, A CD containing such Arya Verses in the correct singing and pronouncing be made available on sale , so that the interested person can have the same. With best regard,
