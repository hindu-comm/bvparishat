The idea that we can have paramANu-s for jala, vAyu and tejas

seems to have been speculated on nothing more than analogy -

of pRthvIseeming to have it, as it looks more likely/plausible.

  

The further question is when we speak of

a-pan"cIkRta-bhUta-s andpan"cIkRta-bhUta-s.

Are the former the ones supposed to be atomic ?

  

Has the postulate of certain of the paramANu-s being yogi\[mAtra\]-pratyaks"a

merely an escape-route, or have they been recorded as actually witnessed?

  

Again, if someone says that one can touch the Moon with his fingers \[while yet being situate on earth, that is\] as a consequence of some siddhi (as indeed vAcaspati-mis'ra does state in his commentary on the sAn'khya-kArikA, how are we to construe this ?

  

While true explanations are welcome, ones cooked up for the sake of some symmetry, the pattern being extrapolated to some unwarranted levels, how are we to react ? Should we discard these as old-world-simplicities, or are we to believe that if we just wait enough, these theories can get validated ?
