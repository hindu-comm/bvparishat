It must be remarked that the repertoire of instances of causation that these ancient systems possessed was rather poor. This naturally gets reflected in the quality of their speculations also, such as is countenanced in their positing ofparamANu-s for the bhUta-s; or their analysis that iron has more watery content, whence its cold touch.

  

Veritable tomes have indeed been written exploring the dimensions of, and extrapolating the implications of, theparvata-dhUma-vahni-mahAnasa-ayogolaka instance. Add to this, of course, ghaTa-mRtpiNDa-kulAla-cakra-gArdabha, or tantu-paTa-turI/vema(n).

  

Even some scholars fall into the trap of equating aNu and paramANu with the atom and the nucleus - though their parallel is verily barely nominal; and extol to the skies Kanada and Gautama, wondering, like little kids, how they could know of these centuries ago, and credulously attribute it all to their Rs"itva. All this is hardly warranted.

  

It is the utter ignorance of what is on the other side of the fence/compound - that makes some scientists amaze at what our pandits have attained; and makes some pandits overawed at what scientists have been doing. Ignorance inspires admiration often (and damnation even more often).



It is only those, then, that have some fair acquaintance with both fields that can appraise each, and speak with a sense of balance.

  

This is not to denigrate or underrate the achievements of Indian logic in providing logical frameworks/structures/procedures. But the anxiety exhibited by many, to somehow establish - by hook or by crook, that is - that our ancient scholars knew all that the scientists know today of, or are going to unravel, proceeds precisely from this. It has all the naivette of claiming or believing that the Atharva-veda has all secrets of preparing bombs, that it was all stolen by Germans, and that our pandits are just not, for reasons best known to themselves, revealing the secrets.

  

While on the one hand, many realms of Vedanta or yogic experience have nothing to do with many of the quibblings handled by these logical paradigms (which was what exactly was bemoaned by S'ankara as - ghaTo vA mRt-piNDo'py aNur api ca dhUmo'gnir acalaH etc.); on the other, many of the assumptions in Indian Logic should be received with a good deal of caution and reservation; we have played overly safe by seldom applying any of these logical paradigms to real-life situations.

  

Rather than feeling that our prestige/ego would be maimed by the above considerations, we would do well to wake up to the hard realities of life, and always aim at taking a balanced view, endeavouring to go strictly by facts.

  

It is indubitably a mark of our own inferiority complex that we feel unnerved when we cannot arrive at facts of modern day science, making use merely of our ancient texts; it is as though there is nothing to doubt that the verities presented by modern science - its revisions and metamorphosis notwithstanding - are the most sacrosanct; and that it is that body of knowledge alone that can corroborate or validate the wisdom of our texts of antiquity. Let not our elite construe these assertions of mine as but purgatory to our patriotism.
