I shall try to answer your question in another dimension. please bear with this. First of all we must know, the goal of any Shastra before studying it. Then we can discuss on the topic whether that Shastra really takes us to the promised goal by its stipulated methods. Please refer excerpts of Prashastapada Bhashya with Sridhara's Nyayakandali on that, produced here below.  

द्रव्यगुणकर्मसामान्यविशेषसमवायानां षण्णां पदार्थानां साधर्म्यवैधर्म्यतत्त्वज्ञानं निःश्रेयसहेतुः ।  
तच्चेश्वरचोदनाभिव्यक्ताद्धर्मादेव ।  
तत्त्वतो ज्ञातेषु बाह्याध्यात्मिकेषु विषयेषु *दोषदर्शनाद्विरक्तस्य* समीहानिवृत्तावात्मज्ञस्य तदर्थस्य कर्मण्यकुर्वतस्तत्परित्यागसाधनानि च श्रुतिस्स्मृत्युदितान्यसङ्कल्पितफलान्युपाददानस्यात्मज्ञानमभ्यस्यतः प्रकृष्टविनिवर्तकधर्मोपचये सति *परिपक्वात्मज्ञानस्यात्यन्तिकशरीरवियोगस्य* भावात् । etc.  
  

So, the Darshanakara here defines all of the Padarthas *sufficient only to know their Sadharmya and Vaidharmya*. BECAUSE HE HAS TO LEAD THE ASPIRANT TO SOMETHING ELSE VERY IMPORTANT ACCORDING TO HIM AND TO DESCRIBE ONLY THE PADARTHAS!  

Like wise if we can apply the theory of Newton to our day to day living why shall we have to bother about quantum unless that makes our living more meaningful? Of course, then 'living more meaningful' can be interpreted according to ones own value system. So, it amounts to this that even if Kanada fails to fulfill our modern scientific interpretation of Paramanu, *it does not at all harm his Shastra in guiding an aspirant if he(the aspirant) is sincere enough in following rest of the disciplines stipulated by the Shastrakara as he promises only* निःश्रेयस. If one has to question, then he has to question within the parameters(considering their objectives) of that Shastra and cannot make सङ्कर of Shastras. The objectives of modern science and Darshanas are 180 degrees apart! (that holds good even to claims of equating Vedanta with science as now a days going on!)  

That holds good to Shastras when they apply generally observed notion of Sun being rising in the east and setting in the west too and Upanishadic statements like आकाशाद्वायुः, वायोरग्निः, अग्नेरापः, अद्भ्यः पृथिवी etc.(which might have been discarded by science).  

  

Whatever other scholars have opined also count along with this.
