Sorry, I just saw the reply by Prof.Tushar Sarkar. his comment - *'Therefore, if later day science contradicts the atomicity \[paramanutva\] of water, or of earth or fireetc., some of the nyaya **assumptions** need to be changed, but given the assumptions, the theory remains OK (= consistent).'* is interesting! Looking forward for any further comments.



Regards
