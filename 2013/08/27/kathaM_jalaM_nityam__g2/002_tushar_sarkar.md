Snehaspadeshu Gadadhara,  
Your question/doubt about *'paramanutva'* of water is very pertinent. The way I see it proper to answer it is this:  
1. At the time of writingthe TS, it was believed that water is an elementary substance consisting of indivisible atoms. Even 300 yrs ago that was the belief among the thinkers/scientists in the West.  
2. The *naiyayikas* also ***assumed*** three things (a)that there has to be an intrinsic similarity between an effect & its cause, so that 'only likes can produce likes', (b) every basicelement in nature consists of'ultimately indivisible' atomic components and (c) thatallobjects of experience in the worldmust possess some specificsimple/basic *quality*(= tangible physical characteristics)e.g.,liquidity (ofwater),hardness (of earth), temperature (of fire)etc., or a specificcombinationthereof. So, every tangible physical feature of a naturalthing can be explained in terms of the qualities of water, fire, etc. or their combinations.  
3. **If** one accepts/assumes **all** the above, **then**it follows that according to the *nyaya* view, the ultimate constituents of each one of water, air, earth etc., ***must*** *be atoms* of the respective kinds, just as, **if**you accept/assume that the price of an orange is Rs. 200/- **then** for 3 oranges you have to pay Rs. 600/-. Whether that's the real price of an orange or not, does not matter.  
4. Therefore, if later day science contradicts the atomicity \[*paramanutva*\] of water, or of earth or fireetc., some of the *nyaya* **assumptions** need to be changed, but given the assumptions, the theory remains OK (= consistent).Unless looked in this way, it hardly makes sense to speak of atoms of 'fire'.5. Finally,[acc.to](http://acc.to) modern science eventhe so-called atoms (of hydrogen etc.) are NOT really ***in**divisible*.It should be clear by nowthatthe relationship between **actual** scientific theory and a corresponding philosophical speculation is quite interesting and complex. More on this, if you are interested.

तत्र परमाणु रूपं जलं नित्यम्\| परं विज्ञाने H2O इति water molecule
भवति\| this molecule can be divided into atoms in the form of H-OH. if this molecule is divided in the form of H and OH it looses its property of 'जलत्वम्'. then how can we say "परमाणुरूपं जलं नित्यम्\|" जलस्य परमाणुरूपस्य अभावात् ?
