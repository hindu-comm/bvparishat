I agree with Prof. Sarkar. I think if one keeps this fact in mind that the NyayaVaisheshika system does not provide report of an experiment in the Physical Laboratory then problems of this type can be minimised. This system provides you cognitive and logical analysis. Please see whether this makes any sense to you. What is paramanu cannot be equated with atom of physical sceience. Paramanu is the logical state or soucein terms ofwhich astructure or mass is related in cause and effect relationship. If this method of understanding is adopted it may make sense.
