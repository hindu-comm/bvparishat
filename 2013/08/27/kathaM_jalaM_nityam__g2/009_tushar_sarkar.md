Respected Scholars,  
I am glad that the discussion \[on anutva of water\] has drawn attention of scholars like Professor B.V.K.Shastri. A few words on his comments: **1.** How torelate 'anu-paramanu' to' molecule-atom-sub-atomic particles'? \> 'anu' \[or 'paramanu'\] was a *hypothesis* about the smallest indivisible constituents of a thing. As such, 'anu-tara' makes no sense. So, 'anu' = 'paramanu'& paramanu cannotbe taken to mean sub-atomic particles. **2.** Now, if one *defines* 'anu' as thatsmallestconstituent of a thing which, **if** broken further, *wouldfail tohave*that thing's features \[svabhava/dharma\] **then,** by that definition,a water moleculeshould count as an'anu' of water. The issue hereis partly conceptual & partly definitional. **3.** Physics today, is less stubbornly 'materialistic' than it was a century ago. One respectable contemporaryinterpretation of quantummechanics \[QM\] is not shy of bringing 'consciousness' in the picture. So, the view thatscience\[=physics\] is 'materialistic' whereasphilosophical speculations are 'spiritualistic' in orientation, is an uncritical oversimplification.However, Shastri-ji made a very insightful observation in this connection viz. in Indian phil. 'consciousness is **conceptualizedintegrally** with matter'. \> I think,that's why mind-body dualism seldom took a *Cartesian* turn in India. **4.** That 'science'& 'philosophy' share a common root is anundeniable fact.Even Newton's 'physics' was 'natural philosophy'. Given this, it is not surprising to see that many philosophical speculations of yesterday become scientific theories later \[e.g., Aristarchus's \[300 BC\]'heliocentric' view became a scientific theorywith Copernicus; Demoritus's / Vaishesika philosophy of atomism became scientific atomism withDaltonetc. Older 'vortex' theory became scientifically respectable ***'ether'*** after Maxwell.There are many similar other cases too. Interestingly, respectable scientific theories of one time e.g.,Newton's notion of'absolute space', Maxwellian 'ether' etc.,losttheir scientific credibility & were relegated later to the status of metaphysical 'hang-overs' from earlier philosophy. Indeed, the relationship between 'philosophical speculations' & their corresponding 'scientific theories' is very complex & interesting. There is a give-and-take relationship between them. Philosophical speculations often pop up asscientific theories and gain respectability. Similarly, a scientific theory may lose its scientific respectability and be relegated to the arena of philosophy/metaphysics.  
There is a huge amount of writings\[including someof mine\] on this topic and also by many eminent scholars. During my visit to India \[Jan-Apr-2014\] I plan to contact some traditionalIndian scholars who seem interested & learn more about their views on this topicfrom them. Expecting to see moreacademic exchanges on this topic through the bvp forum.  

Professor Tushar Sarkar.
