Respected galaji,  
  
we require a scholar who can explain text like bhattikavyam, kalidas raghuvamsam .etc alongwith quoting panini sutras for the explanation .I am in ramakrishna ashram khar west, mumbai.The scholar has to come to the ashrama to teach. Twice a week coming will suffice.Occasionally some doubts related mainly to the grammatical side of the scriptures also is expected from him to clarify.  
  
regards
