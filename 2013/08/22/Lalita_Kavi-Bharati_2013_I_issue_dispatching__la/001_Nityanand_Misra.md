Dwivedi Ji  
  
A request to you (and other editors) - along with the dispatch information, can you please also share the contents (list of articles/poems along with names of authors/poets) of each issue with the group? This will benefit those who do not subscribe to the magazine.  
  
I do not subscribe to Samskrita journals, but directly request editors for a copy of published articles/poems that I am interested in. I have asked Devarshi Kalanath Shastri Ji for two articles published in Bharati, and he was very kind to oblige both times. I may similarly request you in future for specific articles.  
  
Thanks, Nityanand
