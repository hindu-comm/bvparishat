\> An interesting article by Aatish Taseer. His quotation  
\> 'it is hard to realize,’ Coomaraswamy writes inThe Dance of Shiva, ‘how completely the continuity of Indian life has been severed. A single generation of English education suffices to break the threads of tradition and to create a nondescript and superficial being deprived of all roots—a sort of intellectual pariah who does not belong to the East or the West.’

While acknowledging the all too frequent problem in this regard, I like to think that this is not an insurmountable problem. Right on this list, we have several people who can and do enrich our roots, on top of using an English education to advantage. Surely, we can hope that this tribe increases in numbers.  

\> Meaning of "BRAHMA AKKAR VRITI  
\> Chandi Devi \<[annam...@gmail.com]()\> Aug 20 09:48AM -0700   
\>  
\> Dear Scholars,  
\>   
\> I am looking for the meaning of Brahma Akkar Vriti (Vritti). I cannot find  
\> it on the web. A friend translated it for me as: "Brahman is beyond  
\> movement/change". Is this correct?  
\>   
\> What I do find on the web is 'Brahmakara Vritti'. I have found a few  
\> interpretations of this, from, 'the highest expansion of mind into infinite  
\> nature, to, 'devout thoughts into the nature of god......' + more.

The term typically used in the original vedanta texts (post–Sankara, at least as old as 13th-14th centyears) is akhaNDAkara vRtti. The explanation provided in the link found by Dr. Bhat is pretty comprehensive for much of the Advaita tradition. It is not really something newly thought up in the recent past.

\> The
