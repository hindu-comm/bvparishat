A snake moves on its stomach (Napolean said the same about an army - "An army marches on its stomach").

A snake's movement is crooked and curved, not straight.  

The crow is described as a crooked bird in Indian tradition. E.g. Goswamiji says in the RCM -कुटिल काक इव सबहि डेराहीं

  

Hence a snake's stomach (i.e. movement by Lakshana) is like a crow.

  

काकोदरः फणी इत्यमरः

काकस्येवोदरं यस्य स काकोदरः  
कुटिलगतिस्वभावोदरवान् सर्पइत्यर्थः

Also Google up "lateral undulation" and "sidewinding" - the Sidewinder's movement is one of the most fascinating movement techniques in the animal world - at any time only two points of the Sidewinder's body touch the scorching desert sands.
