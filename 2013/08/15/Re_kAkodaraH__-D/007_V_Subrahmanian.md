My thanks to all those who responded to my request, including Sri Nityanand. My question originated upon reading a subhAShitam verse:  

  
कृतमपि महोपकारं पय इव पीत्वा निरातङ्कम् ।

प्रत्युत हन्तुं यतते काकोदरसोदरः खलो जगति ॥ ७६ ॥

अन्वयः : जगति काकोदर-सोदरः खलः कृतं महोपकारं पय इव पीत्वा प्रत्युत निरातङ्कं हन्तुं यतते ।

In this world the wicked, who is like the brother of a serpent, drinks like milk (benefits from) the great help done to him and without any compunction tries to kill (harm) even the one who has helped him.  

\[There are slight variations in the book I have\]  
  

I have another question, regarding the word क्रमेलकः (camel):  
गुणिनां गुणेषु सत्स्वपि पिशुनजनो दोषमात्रमादत्ते ।  

पुष्पे फले विरागी क्रमेलकः कण्टकौघमिव ॥  

\[A slanderous person takes/highlights only the defects of the noble in spite of their noble qualities. It is like the camel, discarding the fruits and flowers relishes chewing thorns.\]  

I would like to know how the word क्रमेलकः comes to mean a camel.
