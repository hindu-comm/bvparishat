REST IN PIECE

As you have rightly said, RIP does not gel with philosophy. It holds good for some one believing the burial ends the journey of the soul which is permanently attached with the body.

Pitrumedha Prapaathaka gives us the guide to wish the departed soul. In fact departed soul is the perfect expression for everyone other than a liberated soul JeevanMukta.

May you obtain comfort in your onward sojourn. Shivaaste Santu Panthaanah, which is the common greeting before travel, holds good for the journey beyond this body. We are not in a position to determine the concourse of the soul as we are not privy to the list of his (mis)/deeds.

('Te' word means 'to you' or 'those'. Both are valid in this context.)

"Let those paths be comfortable and fine for you".

Or

"Comfortable onward Journey "  
COJ  
in short, seems to be an appropriate expression.

In philosophical realm, Peace is Shanti which is the perpetual aspect of Aatman. Shaanti Samruddham Amrutam. Hence, the wish that the soul may realise its bastion of peace, after the departure, might seem infructious.
