Dear Sirs,  
  

I deeply mourn the sad demise of Late Prof. Arjun Vadkar as his unparalleled modern satire kaNTakaanjali has been a great source of joy (for the sheer beauty of the expression) and pain (because the world pictured there is still worse:-) to me since many years. May his soul rest in peace and entertain the minds of the gods through his heavenly version of another kaNTakaanjali.  
  
  

regards  
  

ganesh
