FYI, there is a short article on S D Joshi on the English Wikipedia now

  

<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shivram_Dattatray_Joshi>

  

The editor has based the test on three references so far - the Maharashtra Times article below, the preface by Prof. Deshpande in the book Paninian Studies and the Obituary on Boston University website by Paul Kiparsky.Request people who know more details about his life and works to add to the article.

  

Kiparsky mentions in his obituary that many of Joshi's views were remarkably original, while some were controversial. I have not read Joshi to comment on Kiparsky's claim, but I do recalla short conversation with him in 2009 where he said the Shiv Sutras are Paurusheya (which is also the position of Arya Samaja grammarians e.g. Bhima Sena Shastri, Brahmadatta Jijnasu, Yudhishthira Mimamsaka, Pandit Ishvarchandra, etc) - a position with which traditional grammarians do not agree. I have also heard that Joshi did not treat Patanjali as the ultimate authority and his view was that Patanjali made mistakes in interpreting Panini at several places. Scholars familiar with his works may want to throw some light on aspects where Joshi disagrees with the Bhashyakara.
