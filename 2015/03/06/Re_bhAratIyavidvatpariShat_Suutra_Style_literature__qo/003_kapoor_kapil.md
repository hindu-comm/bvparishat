Absence of metre, *chhanda,* is another marker*, lakshana,* of *suutra* literature*.*

All six  
darshana, shadadarshana, composed in suutras are in  
suutra'style', and like all such compositions are  
also referred to as 'suutras'. As 'technical  
style of Sanskrit', it was the characteristic mode  
employed in most technical  
literature.Regards,kapil
