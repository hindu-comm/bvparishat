All six darshana, shadadarshana, composed in suutras are in suutra'style', and like all such compositions are also referred to as 'suutras'. As 'technical style of Sanskrit', it was the characteristic mode employed in most technical literature.

Subject: {भारतीयविद्वत्परिषत्} Suutra Style literature

  

  

Dear members,  
  

I am curious to know if there is any other literature other than Panini's A.s.taadhyaayii and Pingala's Chandas'saastra which is also in the suutra style.  
  

I remember somewhere reading about the period in which suutra style work was more prevalent. Is it the period of Panini-Pingala's?  
  

Thanks and regards,  

Amba Kulkarni
