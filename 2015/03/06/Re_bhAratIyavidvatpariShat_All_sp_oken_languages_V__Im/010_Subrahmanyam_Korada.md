नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

(3) In the verse listed here, am I correct in my understanding that out of two śabdas Upādāna śabda is Nimitta śabda and Sphota śabda is for meaning (Artha)?

द्वावुपादनशब्देषुशन्दौशब्दविदोविदुः।

एकोनिमित्तंशब्दानाम्अपरो’र्थेप्रयुज्यते

(4)Different people may pronounce Upādāna śabda slightly differently (Vaikharī) but for understanding of meaning one resort to sphota śabda. (Apabhraṁśas are exdcluded from consideration).

(5) Could we say that Upadana sabda is Kaarya sabda? 

                    --विद्वान् जोशी

  

3.both are called उपादानशब्दs - means वाचकशब्दौ - the sound of rivers , वीणा (lute), birds , animals etc are also शब्दs(ध्वन्यात्मक) , but they cannot be the cause of 'understanding' - वाचक (वर्णात्मक) means the one that is useful in generating अर्थज्ञानम् - this is what is meant by उपादानशब्दौ ।

between them वैखरी does not denote meaning but is the निमित्तम् /प्रकाशिका / व्यञ्जिका of स्फोटशब्द , which denotes the meaning - both these are विषय of व्याकरणशास्त्रम्।

  

4\. Be it अपभ्रंश or संस्कृतम् - स्फोटशब्द is common - one would get meaning if it is a शब्द in use - here व्याकरणम् comes into picture - if शब्दs acceptable to

व्याकरणम् are employed one would get धर्म - this is धर्मनियम । just like anything can be eaten to kill appetite but for धर्म - पञ्चपञ्चनखा भक्ष्याः। Any lady will do for खेदविगम (खेदः = कामः , दुःखकारणत्वात्) but विवाह would fetch धर्म ।

It is simple - any language(including अपभ्रंश) would do for अर्थ , but संस्कृतम् will be for अर्थ as well as धर्म।

  

5\. वैखरी is कारणम् of स्फोट , which is कार्यम् । स्फोट is कारणम् of अर्थ , which is कार्यम् ( this pattern is there in सांख्यदर्शनम्)

  

  

धन्यो’स्मि
