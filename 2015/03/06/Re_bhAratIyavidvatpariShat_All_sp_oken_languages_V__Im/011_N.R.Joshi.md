Dear Prof. S.Korada, I apologize for asking this question.

I foundyour postingfrom June 2012.



From it I realized my mistake in understanding of the word Upādāna. It seems that all vācaka śabdas (varņātmaka śabdas with meaning) are upādāna śabdas. And Vaikharī is prakaśaka and sphoṭa is prakaśya. I assume my understanding is correct now. I misunderstood Upādāna śabda. Thank you. I really appreciate your patience and eagerness to help me.
