Namaste

  

The discussions in this thread have clarified many subtle points , taking reference to Panini- Patanjali tradition as given in Bhartruhari (- as vyakarana/ shabdaBrahma darshana).

This spiritual linguistics approach (adhi-vacham/ daivee vak/ vak yoga) is the anchor of indian shaastra tradition in analyzing the vedic document.

As is clear from the extracts, the patanjali- endorsement is six- perspective unified analytics of veda= Six vedanga systems augmentation to arrive at the meaning of veda. This vedanga tradition and tools is the foundation to build a vedanta thought from vedas.

  

This approach also shows why and how the historical social degenerative model of linguistics ( apabhramsha- prakrutha- desha bhashaa- videsha bhashaa) fail to explain vedic language analytics, highly praised over last two hundred years all over the world, by positioning vedic Sanskrit as a language in the basket of Indo-European languages.if this position of Vedic language is to be treated as poorva-paksha(- from 19th century time line), it may seem anachonistic that the answers are already present way back in prechristian era writings of Patanjali.

  

The position of vedanga vyakarana of Panini(- and vakyapadeeya philosophy) deals with a TRUE language that would be capable if TOTAL Expression of Intention in communication in a time- transcendent way. ( विवक्षाया: सत्येन समग्रतया उच्चारणम् = वैखरी )-संप्रत्ययार्थं -

This total process happens only in a refined expression and through a conscious ,user applied , rule anchor compliance in Sanskrit. Not to that full extent in other languages.

The designation- prakrit, apabhramsha, mlecchita is a marker if slippage from total true rule compliance. Each irreversible phase of language- usage degeneration (- like an isotope in chemistry) is given a name.

  

But the universality of Sphota process continues irrespective of the degenerate state; what lacks is the awareness of details. The clarity of how a thing works is different for a designer and end user. Every driver of car is not a designer of car or manufacturer!

  

I hope this clarifies some subtle points in the thread pointed by Prof Korada and Paturi, especially on Apabhramsha - which may lead to inaccurate surmises.
