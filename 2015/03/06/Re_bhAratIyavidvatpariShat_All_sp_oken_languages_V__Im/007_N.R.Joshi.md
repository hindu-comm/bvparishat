Dear Prof. Korada,



I do not have proper words to appreciate your efforts to explain certain words and phrases to me. I have saved every of your posting on BVP. Your postings has lion’s share in increasing my knowledge about finer points in the thought process of the ancient India Vaiyākaraņas and Philosophers.

Now I would like to add this.

(1) I am happy to know the etymology of Samskritam word from your posting.

(2) I am happy to know that the Sphota siddhānta is for languages in general-it can be Arabic or any other, including Samskritam.

(3) In the verse listed here, am I correct in my understanding that out of two śabdas Upādāna śabda is Nimitta śabda and Sphota śabda is for meaning (Artha)?

द्वावुपादनशब्देषुशन्दौशब्दविदोविदुः।

एकोनिमित्तंशब्दानाम्अपरो’र्थेप्रयुज्यते

(4) Different people may pronounce Upādāna śabda slightly differently (Vaikharī) but for understanding of meaning one resort to sphota śabda. (Apabhraṁśas are exdcluded from consideration).

(5) Could we say that Upadana sabda is Kaarya sabda?

Please feel free to correct me and pardon my ignorance.

Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
