This is not response to the post of Dr Bhat.



Contnuing with my previous post,



of course , the verses are focussed on S'abdanityatva and S'abda anityatva also.

दैवी वाग् व्यतिकीर्णॆयम् अशक्तैर् अभिधातृभिः /

अनित्यदर्शिनां त्व् अस्मिन् वादॆ बुद्धिविपर्ययः // वाक्य\_१।१८२ //

has its second half:

अनित्यदर्शिनांत्वस्मिन् वादॆ बुद्धिविपर्ययः

S'abda anityatvavaadins cite the very fact of mixing as evidencefor speech being man-made.

But S'abdanityatva positi

on taken in these verses too does not mean Sanskrit is the origin of all the languages. Nor does it mean that only Sanskrit words communicate meaning to any human being.
