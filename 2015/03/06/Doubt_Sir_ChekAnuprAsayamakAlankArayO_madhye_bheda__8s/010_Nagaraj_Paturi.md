Since the thread was initiated for the distinction between chekanuprasa and yamaka, let me state the following:



1\. Definitions of both Chekanuprasa and Yamaka have undergone several changes from the early Alankara texts to modern times



2\. Though chekanuprasa originally had just the repetition of a sequence of consonants as the defining feature, currently, repetition of a sequence of pair of consonants as its characteristic gained more currency in most of the poetics of Indian languages where this alankaara has been borrowed. This 'pair of consonants' criteria is not a new creation. It has its origin in the old Alankara texts such as that of Ruyyaka themselves.



3\. Though yamaka originally had just the repetition of a sequence of syllables (combinations of consonants and vowels) as the defining feature, currently the difference in meaning between the two occurrences of the syllabic sequence as its characteristic gained morecurrency in most of the poetics of Indian languages where this alankaara has been borrowed. This difference in meaning criteria is not a new creation. It has its origin in the old Alankara texts themselves.
