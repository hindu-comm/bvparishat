I request Prof. Nagaraj garu to permit for slightly revising the conclusions drawn by Prof. Nagaraj garu.

1. **It is not the disagreement between Rani Sadasiva Murty and Prof. Nagaraj garu. It is just the presentation of the prevalent differences regarding Chekanuprasa and Yamaka.** The postings of Sadasiva Murty in this thread may once again be read from this point of view. No where Sadasiva Murty owns any of the statements. It is an effort to substantiate the concept with the available material in the ALANKARA TEXTS.

**2. Regarding the YAMAKA -**

What Prof. Nagaraj ascribes a statement to be that of SADASIVA MURTY is:

***Yamaka is the repetition of sequence ofsyllables(consonant-vowel combinations) without any concern for meaning.***  

The Statement of Sadasiva Murty regarding YAMAKA is:

*" In Yamakalankara there can be variation in meaning in the repetition.**But the cheif beautifying factor is the repetition of the word and not the variation of the meaning.**It (the meaning) is less important in beautifying the occasion."*  

*  
*

3. The Conclusions of Sadasiva Murty in his mail of this thread on 14-03-2015 is not the conclusions of this thread. I too hope that the conclusions of Prof. Nagaraj garu are also not the conclusions of this thread. 

Sadasiva Murty has much to say in this connection about :

1. The Nature of Sabda Alankaras

2. All the Types of Anuprasas and the place of Cheka Anuprasa

3\. How faithful are Indian Languages in following the Alankara system of Sanskrit

and other matters. Certainly these shall be added very soon.

  

But a request is that Sadasiva Murty has to attend 5 seminars during the coming two weeks. i.e. from 17-03-2015 to 28-03-2015. Hence he may be excused for taking a pause in participating in the future discussions of this thread.

Warm regards,

**Dr. Rani Sadasiva Murty**
