As the root question of the thread is a very simple one I confined my answers to a very basic level.

It doesn't mean that the historical development of the Sabdalankaras is ignored by me.

While answering any question on Alankara Sastra the following scheme always has its live influence in my mind.

As far as the 'Alankara Texts' are to be considered in their historical order the ideal sequence can be in the following manner:

Bharata (300BC around), Bhamaha (725-750 AD), DAndi (600-680AD), Udbhata (750-850AD), Vamana (800 AD around), Rudrata (of almost same age with Vamana), Anandavardhana (860-890AD), Rajasekhara (in the same period around), Mukula bhatta (925 AD), Bhatta Tauta (950-980 AD), Bhattanayaka (980), Kuntaka (Between 10-11 Centuries AD), Mahimabhatta (1020-1100AD), Bhoja (11 century AD), Kshemendra (990-2066 AD), Mammata (1050-1100AD), Ruyyaka (1135-1150AD), Vagbhata of Vagbhata Alankara (1125-1143AD), Hemachandra (1136-1143AD), Jayadeva (1150-1200AD), Vidyadhara (1285-1325AD), Vidyanatha (14th Century), Vagbhata of Kavyanusasana (14th CenturyAD), Vishvanatha (1300-1380AD), Bhanudatta (1450-1500AD), Rupagosvami (15-16 Centuries), Kesava Mishra (16th CenturyAD), Appayya Dikshita of 15554-1626AD), Jagannatha (1620-1665AD), Kavikarnapura (17th Century AD) and so on. Of course I can extend this list at the latest to our contemporary times.

Among these Alankarikas : Eight Prasthanas or Schools of Aesthetic Excellence or Kavyatma Vadas in other words to say are :

Bharata's Rasa Theory, Bhamaha's Alankara Theory, Dandin's Guna Theory, Vamana's Riti Theory, Anandavardhana's Dhvani Theory, Kuntaka's Vakrokti Theory, Mahimabhatta's Anumana Theory and Kshemendra's Aucitya Theory. These are the most prominent and ruling theories in the Alanakara Sastra.

Some scholars consider 6 schools only ignoring Alankara Theory and Guna Theory of Bhamaha and Dandin.

  

The reason for giving prominence for these 8 schools is:

These eight masters gave KAVYATMA status to these 8 Aspects : RASA, ALANKARA, GUNA, RITI, DHVANI, VAKROKTI, ANUMANA and AUCITYA while the rest of the all other Alankarikas were mere followers or modifiers of the Views of these masters.

Among the rest of the Alankarikas also the following are Mile Stones: Mammata, Vishvanatha, Vidyanatha, Jayadeva, Appayya Dikshita and Jagannatha.

Undoubtedly the texts of Ruyyaka and Vagbhata have a classical status in the order, in the general historical development of any concept the masters mentioned other than these two are given more preference in the tradition.

As far as the present context is concerned I would like to add a few lines:

  

My view while telling "the one time repetition of any consonants as the definition of Cheka Anuprasa" doesn't mean the AVYAVAHITA repetition of those consonants. In that repetition of such consonants they can be in the association of any vowels. *To say in more clear terms the consonantal element of such repetition is fixed and the vowel elements of such units of repetition are variable.*

Hence it was opined by the Acharyas "Vyanjananam Sakrd Aavrttih Chekanuprasah". The same was just translated by me. 

  

Here I further extend my exercise to explain a bit more about the nature of Sabda Alankaras:

Jati, Gati, Riti, Vrtti, Chaaya, Mudra, Ukti, Yukti, Bhaniti, Guphana, Shayya, Pathiti,

Yamaka, Slesha, Anuprasa, Citra, Vakovakya, Prahelika, Gudha, Prasnottara, Adhyeya, Shravya, Prekshya and Abhiniti are some popular Shabda Alankaras accepted by the times of Bhoja. Of course Acharyas like Mammata and Vishvanatha did not accept all these but a few.

  

While calling them SABDA ALANKARAS it doesn't mean that they have no semantic value. They are not meaningless repetitions. As in Yamakalankara there can be variation in meaning in the repetition. **But the cheif beautifying factor is the repetition of the word and not the variation of the meaning.** It is less important in beautifying the occasion.

Let us examine the following examples:

  

विष्णु: सृजति भूतानि विष्णु: संहरति प्रजा:।

विष्णु: प्रसूते त्रैलोक्यं विष्णुर्लोकाधिदैवतम् ॥ - पादादियमकम्।

Here the word Vishnu is repeated but with no extra-added meaning.

  

यस्य यस्य रमणस्य मे गुणा:

येन येन वसगां करोति माम्।

येन येन हि समेति दर्शनं

तेन तेन वशगां करोति माम्॥ - संदष्टयमकम्।

Here also the repetition of the words have no special semantic charms. This is the instance of Yamaka. 

  

गेहे गेहे जङ्गमा हेमवल्ली

वल्ल्यां वल्ल्यां पार्वणश्चन्द्रबिम्ब:।

बिम्बे बिम्बे कोकिलानां विराव:

रावे रावे जायते पञ्चबाण:॥ (मुक्तपदग्रस्तम्)

  

Here the repetition of words गेहे गेहे. वल्ल्यां वल्ल्यां, बिम्बे बिम्बे,रावे रावे - are repeated to cover with emphasis every house, every creeper, every bimba and every sound.. Further it is ***JAHALLAKSHANA MULA DHVANI with Abheda Rupaka force ALSO IS THERE***. Here the word VALLI is not mere creeper. It is जङ्गमा हेमवल्ली - A living creeper (A beautiful woman). So in every creeper there is पार्वणश्चन्द्रबिम्ब: (The full moon disc lie Face). In every Bimba (In every face) कोकिलानां विराव: - The sweet notes of a Cukoo Bird.(Such sweet speech of the women). These charms are generated not merely by the repetition of words but by other facts such as Jahallakshana Mula Dhvani's presence and that of Abheda Rupaka force.

  

  

शारदा शारदाम्भोजवदना वदनाम्बुजे।

सर्वदा सर्वदाऽस्माकं सन्निधि: सन्निधिं क्रियात्॥ (श्लेषालंकार:)

शारदाम्भोजवदना सर्वदा (सर्वं ददाति इति सर्वदा) सन्निधि: (सद्रूपज्ञानस्य निधि:) शारदा (सरस्वती) अस्माकं वदनाम्बुजे सर्वदा (सदा) सन्निधिं क्रियात् ।

Here also we have the repetition of words. But this is not an instance of YAMAMKA. This is an instance of Slesha. (Abhanga Slesha).

  

रविकिरणानुगृहीतानि कमलानि कमलानि।

नयने तस्यैव नयने ते।

(अर्थान्तरसंक्रमितवाच्यध्वनि:)

Here there is astriking difference in the second repetition ofकमलानि and नयने with a deviation from their denotative meaning with full force of suggestion. Hence this is given as an illustration of Arthantara Sankramita vAcyadhvani. 

Ruyyaka gave this sloka as an example for Lata anuprasa. But the critics like Abhinavagutpa denied.

Hence to conclude:

1\. Every repetition of words does not constitute YAMAKA.

2\. YAMAKA is mostly fanciful verbal repetition with less importance to the meaning in adding charms to the context.

  

I have a grand collection of examples from GERMAN and ENGLISH languages also for CHEKA ANUPRASA, VRTTI ANUPRASA, YAMAKA, PUN and other Sabdalankaras and also of ARTHALANAKRAS.

But since it is out of context to speak all of them keeping in view the necessity of the root question I did not venture to do so.

Warm Regards,
