In छेकानुप्रास there is no concern for meaning. In यमक there is concern for meaning too.



In छेकानुप्रास what gets repeated is a sequence of consonants. Whether the sounds with such same sequence of meanings are meaningful words or not, even if they are meaningful words whether their meaning is different or not is not is not is not of concern.



In यमक the phonemic sequence that gets repeated has tomake two different meaningful expressions with two different meanings.



That is why in some classifications छेकानुप्रासgets categorized under शब्दालंकारonly whereas यमक gets categorized under उभयालंकार
