Dear Shri HNBhat Ji,

Thanks for your kind gesture to smoothen the situation. I too have high regard for Prof. Nagaraj garu. Not only in this thread but also in all other threads the participation of Prof. Nagaraj Garu is very much scholarly and highly authentic.

My intention in stretching this thread to this extent also is not to confront the professor. It has been an effort only to find out (not even to fix) the possible boundaries of the matter in discussion.

Yes. I won't any more extend this thread further.  

Warm Regards, 

**Dr. Rani Sadasiva Murty**

I think the question was the difference of छेकानुप्रास and यमक, than the total history of Alankarashastra in regard to these two (this is available in the Prabha commentary on Dandin, provided by Vamana Jhalkikar) and the detailed varieties of यमक provided by Bharata in his Natyashastra, and later rhetoricians of Alankara School. Hence this thread overgrown of its initial intention and it may be wise to wind up than continue listing the difference of opinions between the two members who are very informative and thought provoking. Sorry for my comments. It is not made with any ill feeling. The original question is a matter for 5 marks in the examinations and which need a reply of a paragraph, which the questioner intended to get an answer from the group.

  

Thanks for both the scholars sharing their expertise in  
Alankarashastra.
