Let us conclude as follows:



1\. How to distinguish between Chekanupraasa and Yamaka: Prof. Rani disagreed with Nagaraj's suggestion that Chekanupraasa is therepetition of a sequence of **consonants** and Yamaka is the repetition of
phonemic sequencewith a difference in meaning and said thataccording to ancient alankara texts, Chekanupraasa is therepetition of a sequence of **consonants** only once and Yamaka is the repetition of sequence of **syllables**(consonant-vowel combinations) without any concern for meaning.****-



2\. *Nagaraj agreed withProf. Rani*andtried to explain his position bysaying thatdifference inmeaning in the repeated phonemic sequence inYamaka as pointof distinction was not his invention but was in line with the currently prevalentidea indifferent books dealing with Yamaka in various Indian languages. He alsosaid that such difference inmeaning in the repeated phonemic sequence inYamakawas very much there in some of the ancient alankara texts themselves.



3\. Nagaraj agrees that the contemporary books dealing with Yamaka in various Indian languages might havewronglystereotyped a certain strand of yamaka as all ofyamaka.



4\. In fact to realize thatyamaka with a difference in meaning is only one of many kinds of Yamaka is useful for understanding various available lakshyas in Sanskrit and other Indian languages.Many lakshyas which would have been left out without any name based on the idea that yamaka with adifference in meaning is the only kind of Yamaka would nowget classified as one of many differentYamakas.
