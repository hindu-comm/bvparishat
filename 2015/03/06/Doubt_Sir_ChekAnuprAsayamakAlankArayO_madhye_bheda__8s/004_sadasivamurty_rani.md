Cheka Anuprasa and Yamaka - Both are Sabda Alankaras only.

The following views popular in Sanskrit poetics can help to understand the difference between these two.

Anuprasa is of three types as Cheka Anurasa, Vritti Anuprasa and Lata Anuprasa.

Of these these three : Cheka Anuprasa is defined as:

छेका: विदग्धा:- छेकगतो विदग्धाश्रित: अनुप्रास: छेकानुप्रास: - "सोऽनेकस्य सकृत्" - अनेकस्य अर्थात् व्यञ्जनस्य सकृत् - एकवारं सादृश्यम् - छॆकानुप्रास:।  

The wordछेका:means Scholars or Learned people. As this kind of alliteration is found in the usage of renowned scholars it is called Cheka anuprasa and **it is one time repetition (only) of even many consonants**.

Ex. ततोऽरुणपरिस्पन्दमन्दीकृतवपु: शशी।

दध्रे कामपरिक्षामकामिनीगण्डपाण्डुताम्॥ This example is self explanatory.

As the rest of the two Anuprasas are out of the context in this thread no concentration is paid here to explain them both.

**Here the point to be noted is repetition of every consonant for only one time.**

  

Now about YAMAKAM -

From Bharata to Mammata all the Alankarikas read this under Sabdalankara varga only. For the appreciation of scholars two definitions of Yamaka by Bharata and Mammata are presented here.

  

शब्दाभ्यासस्तु यमकम् पादादिषु विकल्पितम् । - भरतमुनि:।

Abhyasa means reduplication ... Reduplication of the sounds in a foot and so on is YAMAKA.

  

अर्थेसत्यर्थभिन्नानाम् सा पुन: श्रुति: यमकम्। - मम्मटाचार्य:।

It is the repetition of similarly sounding words or syllables with difference in meaning is YAMAKA.

आवृत्तिं वर्णसंघातगोचरां यमकं विदु:। साहित्यदर्पणे  

The repetition of syllabic collection is YAMAKA.

Here are two reasons for counting this in the group of Shabdalankaras:

1\. Alankaras are charm enhancers of Poetry. **Here the Charm of the context is enhanced only due to the repetition of sounds in the form of words or syllabic collections**.

2\. Though there is a condition of maintaining Difference in Meaning it is just incidental and it doesn't add anything in particular in the process of enhancing the beauty of the context. No special effort is there from the side of the poet to add any beauty through Arthabheda in this Alankara. Hence this is a Sabdalankara only.

Keen study of Bharata's Natyasastra, Visvanatha's Sahityadarpana, Mammata's Kavya Prakasa and other such texts can help to appreciate this topic more.
