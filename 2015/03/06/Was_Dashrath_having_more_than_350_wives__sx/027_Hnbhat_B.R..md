Thank you for clarification from Anandaramayana, which makes clear the idea of 350, mentioned as सार्धसप्तशताः the half of the total 700 wives, in Chapter 34. which might have been taken by the author of Anandaramayana. This makes some sense, why he used the same way to express the number as अर्धसप्तशतास्तास्तु  mentioning the number of queens who accompanied Kausalya and whom Rama bid farewell. But in this context Sumithra is left out. Kaikeyi might not be along with others. Or it may be a casual omission of the two other queens, but only mention of 350 who accompanied Kausalya, when Dasaratha asked Sumantra, all of his wives present in his harem. Though this is not relevant, to the question of total number of total wives, it is strange no mention of either Kausalya or Sumitra is made in this context,

  

but in Ch.39 asत्रयश्शतशतार्धाश्च he mentions clearly(?) 3+hundreds and 50. त्रेस्त्रयः आदेश is pointed out as आर्ष.

Anyhow, he mentions the number 350 directly, without reference to 700 number. In this chapter also कैकेयी and सुमित्रा are not mentioned, but only कौसल्या and the 350 mothers are mentioned. May be it did not deserve any specific mention in the context.
