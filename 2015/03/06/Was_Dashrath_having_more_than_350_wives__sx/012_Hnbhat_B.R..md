Anybody can express view anything a number denotes.

But in the verse quoted in the context, it expressly states it refers to the numbers of ladies (if not wives) accompanying Kausalya. That much is certain from the line.

  

सुमंन्त्रानय मे दारान् ये केचिदिह मामकाः।

  

दारैः परिवृतस्सर्वैर्द्रष्टुमिच्छामि धार्मिकम्।।2.34.10।।

=

सुमन्त्र: Sumantra, मामकाः all my (consorts), ये केचित् whosoever, इह are here, मे दारान् my wives, आनय bring them, सर्वैः by all, दारैः with wives, परिवृतः surrounded by, धार्मिकम् virtuous Rama, द्रष्टुम् to see, इच्छामि I want.

  

The above is the order of Dasaratha.

  

This is how he describes the event of the queens folowing his request brought by Sumantra:

  

*अर्धसप्तशतास्तास्तु प्रमदास्ताम्रलोचनाः।*

  

कौसल्यां परिवार्याथ शनैर्जग्मुर्धृतव्रताः।।2.34.13।।

  

  

अथ thereafter, धृतव्रताः faithful to their vows, ताम्रलोचनाः women with copperred eyes, ताः those, अर्धसप्तशताः half of seven hundred (three hundred and fifty), प्रमदाः women, कौशल्याम् to Kausalya, परिवार्य surrounding, शनैः slowly, जग्मुः reached.

  

This is the commentary तत्त्वदीपिका ---

  

*अर्द्धेति । अर्धसप्तशताः अर्धं सप्तशतस्येत्येकदेशसमासः । पञ्चाशदधिकशातत्रयसङ्खयासङ्ख्येयेत्यर्थः ।* ताम्रलोचनाः, रामवियोगदुःखात् ।। 2.34.13 ।।  

  

And he doesn't give any Tattva in the above number. The number of 350 is not given directly, but as half of 700 = 350. 3 stands for three worlds, and other things. 5 stands for Indriya's. and प्राण-s. 0 stands for आकाश, 0r खम्. and so on one can invent तत्त्व-s.

Now you can wait for the explanation of Koteswara Rao, if he is a member of this forum.
