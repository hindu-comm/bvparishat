Dear friends,  
  

This explanation that Dasharatha had to marry every time Parashurama was around, does not appear to be convincing. However, there is a Pauranic injunction that a man cannot be given the death-penalty, if his wife is having ऋतुकाल, (i.e., the man cannot be killed until the ऋतुरक्षा is over). I read it long ago in a Purana, though I do not remember the reference at this time. May be, some of our Purana-scholars will remember this. Thus having many wives could probably ensure the safety of Dasharatha. There could be other reasons too, such as Dasharatha had to marry many women to get children but he did not get any till he performed the Putresti Yajna.  
  

Regards,
