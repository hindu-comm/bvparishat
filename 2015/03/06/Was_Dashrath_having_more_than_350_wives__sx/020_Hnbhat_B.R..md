Here is another mention later of 350 wives as:

  

एतावदभिनीतार्थमुक्त्वा स जननीं वचः।

*त्रयश्शतशतार्धाश्च* ददर्शावेक्ष्य मातरः।।2.39.36।।

  

where all the 350 ladies are called as mothers, while he spoke the consoling words to कौसल्या only. in next verse also they are referred to as mothers to whom he bids farewel in the next verses:

  

ताश्चापि स तथैवार्ता मातृ़र्दशरथात्मजः।

  

धर्मयुक्तमिदं वाक्यं निजगाद कृताञ्जलिः।।2.39.37।।

  

whether दशरथ married all of them or not, question raised by Bijoy Mishra. All were referred to as mothers by Valmiki and also as wives of दशरथ. I think in this 350 wives, कैकेयी might not be आर्ता, if she had accompanied along with others.
