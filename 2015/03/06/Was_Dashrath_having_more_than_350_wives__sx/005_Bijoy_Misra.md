Dear Dr Radhakrishnan,  

This story is not in Valmiki's Ramayana. Dasaratha is aware of ParshurAma  

and is dead scared when the latter blocks them while they were returning from Mithila.  

But Valmiki says nothing about the origin of these other wives in Dasaratha's  
palace. However, they do become "widows" upon Dasaratha's death.  

Best regards,  

BM
