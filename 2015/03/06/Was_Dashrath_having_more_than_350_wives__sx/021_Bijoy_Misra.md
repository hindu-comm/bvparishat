Dear Dr Bhat and friends,  
माता as a word is used by Valmiki in various contexts connecting women in  
Rama's life. It is fascinating to interpret culture from the use of words. My  
thinking has been that most interpretations with object identifications are  
incorrect. I am only a new entry to the vast field of literature. I offer this  
comment with utter humility but with an objective view.  

Best regards,  

BM
