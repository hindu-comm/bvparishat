Dear Sir,

Besides the reason that the kings in those dayshad many wives through which they also established friendly relations with other countries or kingdoms, it was more essential for Dasaratha. In fact he was , perhaps, the only Kshatriyawho escaped the axe of Parasurama. Parasurama would not kill any Kshatriyas who has tied the wrist band as preparation for marriage. So every time, there is threat of Parasurama coming to Ayodhya, Dasaratha would immediately embark on a new wedlock. That is one of thereasons for having many wives.
