Dear Scholars, Namaste,



Dr.K.S.Narayanacharya who is a reputed scholar in Ramayana and Mahabharata, in one of his lecturessays that Dasaratha used to marry / accept a new wife every time he heard from his spies that Parasurama is in the area looking to eliminate Kshatriyas. It is said that Sri Parasurama used to go away without killing, if the Kshatriya king was in the middle of getting married.



Namaste

Suresh
