Friends,  
Reading of Valmiki would indicate that the royals in the early society did  

maintain an "antahpura" of women who acted as King's consorts. The book  

does not say about their rights or privileges. Most likely they were not  

wedded wives. Valmiki uses a word "dayitA" for his "wives" from whom  

he expects a son. So, after his "putreSTi yajna" he shares the pAyasam  

with only three. The book has to be read in context. The words the  

poet uses have only contextual use in the Chapters.  

Three fifty "striyaH" do appear all together at various occasions:  

Rama going to forest, Dasaratha dying, the party going to meet Rama in  

the forest. It seems they flank Kaushlya in her movement.  

I just finished reading AyodhyAkanDa. I will write later in case  

further reference shows up.
