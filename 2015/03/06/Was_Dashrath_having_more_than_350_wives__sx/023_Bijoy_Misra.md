Dear Dr Bhat,  
It is the English translations that I am concerned. I have not searched the  

commentaries in Sanskrit or other languages. My effort is to interpret  

from the first principles as much I can. I love Valmiki's use of words and  

also the notice the social use in our homes!  

Best regards,  

BM
