Dear Learned Scholars and Guruvars  
Pranaam  
  
  
A small query raised while reading Valmiki Ramayan.  
In Ayodhyakand, 34th Sarga, there is a shloka which says-

  
सुमन्त्र आनय मे दारान् ये केचित् इह मामकाः \|  
दारैः परिवृतः सर्वैः द्रष्टुम् इच्चामि राघवम् \|\|  
  
"Oh, Sumantra! being all my wives, who are here. Surrounded by all of them, I want to see the virtuous Rama."  
  
Later on, another shloka states:  
  
एवम् उक्ताः स्त्रियः सर्वाः सुमन्त्रेण नृप आज्ञया \|  
प्रचक्रमुस् तत् भवनम् भर्तुर् आज्ञाय शासनम् \|\|  
  
All those women, asked thus by Sumantra as per the king's orders, went to his palace, after knowing the instructions of their husband.  
  

अर्ध सप्त शताः ताः तु प्रमदाः ताम्र लोचनाः \|  
कौसल्याम् परिवार्य अथ शनैः जग्मुर् धृत व्रताः \|\|  
  
Encircling Kausalya, three hundred fifty women, steadfast in their vow(of devotion to their husband), with their eyes reddened, went there slowly.  
  
So does it mean that King Dashratha was having more than 350 wives? Or was 350 women were not wives but just caretaker of queens and came along with Kaushalya? If they were caretaker then why they came as Dashrath ordered to bring wives only?  
  
  
Please guide me for the same.  
  
  
Regards
