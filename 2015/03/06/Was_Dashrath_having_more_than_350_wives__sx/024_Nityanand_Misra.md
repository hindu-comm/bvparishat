Please see attached pages from *Rāmayaṇa Mīmāṃsā* which cover this topic extensively with all references. As per Dharmasamrāṭ Karapātra Svāmī, only the accounts of *Vālmīki Rāmayaṇa* (700), *Adhyātma Rāmayaṇa* (700) and *Ānanda Rāmāyaṇa* (353) are reliable while other later accounts are not, and the difference can be accounted for by *Kalpabheda*.
