Dear friends,  
  
The 65th and 66th Chapters of the Ayodhyakanda are related to the death of Dasharatha. There is the wailing of the widowed wives, but no mention of the figure of 350 wives in these chapters.  
  

It is quite possible that Dasharatha married as many as 350 other women for begetting son as his three main wives could not bear any son till Lord Ram was born, although Dasharatha had one daughter born earlier to Kaushalya.  
  

Regards,
