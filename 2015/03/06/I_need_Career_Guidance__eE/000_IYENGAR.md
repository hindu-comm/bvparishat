Hello everyone,  
Can any one suggest me a job for my friend?

M.A(sanskrit) in 2014 with 70.8% from KSOU Mysore, also in TOP 10 list.  
He currently working in private company as trainee engineer, but he is  
hungry to work in Sanskrit field.  
If u send me ur personal mail id, i will send to you the resume of him.  
  
Dhanyavaadaaha,
