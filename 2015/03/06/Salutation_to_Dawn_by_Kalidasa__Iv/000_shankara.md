Pranams to all,

  

The following poem on Dawn is attributed to Kalidasa in "Sanskrit Love Poetry" by W. S. Merwin & J. Moussaieff Masson and also by countless blogs and sites.  

  

Listen to the Exhortation of the Dawn!  
Look to this Day!  
For it is Life, the very Life of Life.  
In its brief course lie all the  
Verities and Realities of your Existence.  
The Bliss of Growth,  
The Glory of Action,  
The Splendor of Beauty;  
For Yesterday is but a Dream,  
And To-morrow is only a Vision;  
But To-day well lived makes  
Every Yesterday a Dream of Happiness,  
And every Tomorrow a Vision of Hope.  
Look well therefore to this Day!  
Such is the Salutation of the Dawn!

I request the scholars of this group to help me identify Kalidasa's original verses which are the basis for the above English translation.

shankara
