The poem is attributed as ‘Author Unknown’ on page 210 of *Respectfully Quoted: A Dictionary of Quotations* (2010, ISBN 9780486472881), published by the US Library of Congress (a reliable source). The editors cite the 1948 edition of *Masterpieces of Religious Literature* (ed. James Dalton Morrison), and add that the poem is‘attributed in some sources to Kalidasa.’Morrison himself on page 318 in the 1905 edition of the work (Harper & Brother Publishers) attributes the poem as ‘Based on the Sanskrit, c. 1200 B.C.’ (sic) and nothing else. That Morrison included it in the work *Masterpieces of Religious Literature* and that he dated it as 1200 B.C. makes me think Morrison \[believed he\] had the \[loose\] translation of a Vedic hymn and not a verse by Kalidasa. Morrison’s work predates *Sanskrit Love Poetry* (first published 1977) by more than half a century. If we cannot trace a source older than Morrison's 1905 work which attributes it to Kalidasa, then most likely the poem's authorship by Kalidasa is a 20th century urban legend invented sometime between 1905 and 1977.
