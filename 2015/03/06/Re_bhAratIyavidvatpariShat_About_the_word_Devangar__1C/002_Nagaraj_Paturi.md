I could recollect two threads on BVP on the topic:





<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/bvparishat/devanagari%7Csort:relevance/bvparishat/S4OTwK2-FV0/n72IwXgbffcJ>

<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/bvparishat/name$20devanagari%7Csort:relevance/bvparishat/dUfB1Ygvle8/yhgBABONpfUJ>



Thought it would be helpful to the interested list members to compare andappreciate the new knowledge/understanding added by the author of the pdf article or the new approach added by it.
