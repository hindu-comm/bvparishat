As a research scholar, I can't understand why you do not give the text in the body of message with reference to the word where did you find a word and avoid sending the blank message with your question in the subject line?

  

Anyhow here is the usage of the word:

  

  

*सांवर्तकः मेघगणः वर्षति* स्म शतं समाः।

धाराभिः हस्तिहस्ताभिः लीयते सलिले विराट्॥११॥

  

Here is the meaning and synonyms of संवर्त - as per Amarakosha:

  

संवर्तः प्रलयः कल्पः क्षयः कल्पान्त इत्यपि ।।१-४-२२।।  

  

Hope you can guess the meaning in the above context for the word सांवर्तक in the above context of उद्धवगीत, describing the प्रलय. सांवर्तकः प्रलयकालीनः, मेघ इव इत्यर्थः।

  

Please try to follow a certain method of writing as a research scholar, as you are expect to write your thesis or article according to the methodology of writing in research.
