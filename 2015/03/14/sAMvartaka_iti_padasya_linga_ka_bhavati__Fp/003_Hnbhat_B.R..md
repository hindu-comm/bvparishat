Sorry. Again and again you are repeating the same mistake of writing the body of the message in the Subject line and the message without any thing in the body.

  

Yourself have written सांवर्तकः इति पदस्य, and asking what is the लिङ्ग of the word सांवर्तक. Strange. I have given the usage and you can decide yourself the लिङ्ग from the usag you can read in my post.
