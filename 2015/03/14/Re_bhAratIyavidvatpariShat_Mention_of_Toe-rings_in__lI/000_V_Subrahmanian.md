In addition to what I had mentioned in an old post below), there is a verse in the Padmapuranam:  
  

Second Chapter where Brahmā addresses Viṣṇu:

  

कालकूटमिदं पश्य कण्ठभूषणमीशितुः ।

सुराङ्गनानां सर्वासां कण्ठमंगलदायकम् ।

  

The context is the amṛta mathanam episode. The second line expresses the following idea: By containing the terrible kālakūṭa viṣham which has become an ornament on the neck of Lord Śiva, the wives of the celestials who participated in the mathanam who would have otherwise perished owing to the poison are now saved of widowhood. The mangala sūtra on their neck is in tact.   

  

The above verse appears to suggest that the tradition of mangalasūtra is there even among celestials.  

  

I could not get the exact reference number of the above verse from the Padmapuranam. I cited the verse from a book that lists the above verse for references under the Brahman-name: nīlakaṇṭha.  

  

If anyone reads a different meaning of that line, that is welcome.

  

warm regards
