Namaste  
  

The following old famous verse says, among other things, that one should recover gold even from feces. This is being proposed by scientists:  

  
विषादप्यमृतं ग्राह्यं *अमेध्यादपि काञ्चनम्* ।  
अमित्रादपि सद्वृत्तं स्त्रीरत्नं दुष्कुलादपि॥  
  
  
अमेध्यादपि काञ्चनम् -  
  
  
<http://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/gold-in-human-faeces-is-worth-millions-geologists/article7025344.ece>  
  
// Geologist suggests extracting precious metals from human waste would keep harmful substances out of the ground — and recover valuable objects//  
  

The above news item reminded me of the verse. One of the meanings for the word 'amedhya' is:  
  
अमेध्य 
[**amedhya**](http://www.spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=amedhya&direction=SE&script=HK&link=yes&beginning=0) n. [faeces](http://www.spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=faeces&direction=ES&script=HK&link=yes&beginning=0)
