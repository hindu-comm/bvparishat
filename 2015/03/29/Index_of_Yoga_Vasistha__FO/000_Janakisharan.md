Om  
Respected Scholars,  
I am searching for index of Yoga Vasistha online, but couldn't find it. We have Vedic Index, Pauranik Index, Ramayana Index etc. but I have not come across of index of Yoga Vasistha.I have Yoga Vasistha (Edited by Laxman Sastri Pansikar) but there is also no index of Shlokas. So it is very difficult to find a shloka from Yoga Vasishtha.  
  
If someone have index of Yoga Vasistha in any form (online/offline/pdf/books), please provide/share it.  
  
Thanking you  
  
Om
