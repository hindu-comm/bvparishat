'Dense chant', may be the appropriate reading. It may be noted that all meanings are not necessarily based on vyutpatti, hence the name 'roodha'. Here, the Kosha-granthas are a strong authority in deciding the meaning. I mean to say, the word ' Ghana' is famous in (for conveying) the meaning of dense, in the 'Ghanapaatha', the words are uttered repeatedly, hence the name Ghanapaatha. ----An inpute from a lay man with regards,
