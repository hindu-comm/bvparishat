There is no difference of the word घन as it is derived from the word "हन् हिंसागत्योः" even though the meaning may differ in many contexts, but derived frin the same root as perमूर्तौ घनः ३।३।७७. मूर्तिः काठिन्यम्।. It can be used in any other senses according to the context, listed in वाचस्पत्यम्, which does not list घनपाठ, or does not say anything about the system:

  

घन¦ पु० *हन--मूर्त्तौ अप् घनादेशश्च ।* १ मेघे २ मुस्तके ३ समूहे

४ दार्द्ये ५ विस्तारे च ६ लौहमुद्गरे मेदि० ७ शरीरे ८ कफे

९ अभ्रके राजनि० । “समत्रिघातश्च घनः प्रदिष्टः” इति

१० सीलावत्युक्ते समाद्धत्रयबधे । ११ निविडे सान्द्रे

त्रि० अमरः १२ वृढे त्रि० मेदि० । १३ पूर्णे १४ सस्पुटे

त्रि० शब्दर० । १५ करतालादिकांस्यवाद्यमेदे १६ मध्यम

नृत्ये च न० अमरः । १७ लौहे न० हेमच० १८ त्वचे

न० राजनि० ।

  

You can very every meaning with the basic meaning हिंसा and गति, if your question is aimed at the derivation according to meaning.

  

Now, the traditional definition, it is waited for from the Vedic Scholars in this forum. There may be some text which is explaining घनपाठ in texts dealing with the recitation of Veda-s. I am not sure, whether the northern Vedic Scholars, practice this अष्ठविकृतिपाठ, as the honorific title घनपाठिन् who has reached the last grade of the eight विकृतिपाठ is heard in the south only as I know. I do not know any North Indian घनपाठिन् if any is there. There are some class of literature, as वेदलक्षण, which may contain definition about these विकृतिपाठ-s and any of them may contain the definition of घनपाठ, and they do not deal with grammatical derivation of the word. So your questions are unrelated. हन् though recorded हिंसा and गति, basically used in the sense हिंसा only and not seen used in the sense गति. One cannot say because of the धात्वर्थ, रामो ग्रामं हन्ति for Rama goes to the village (which is not approved to convey the meaning) and the sentence would be meangless. अयो हन्यतेऽनेन इति अयोघनः - means hammer used for striking iron. And not kill, or torture as one can guess. It can be used figuratively, to mean many other things, the grammatical derivation being the same, derived from the same verb.

  

"प्रघाणप्रघणाऽलिन्दा बहिद्र्वारप्रकोष्ठके" इत्यमरः।  

  

  

Only definition may change which explain the word in compound. If any already there, some scholar would be able to give here.
