What Mr.Jayaraman wants is whether there any traditional definition of घनपाठ and other system of reciting, in the ancient literature on Vedic recitation, how to pronounce in each method. Here is an explanation how to recite, written in English, but no definition of each is not given.

The Vedic scholars may be able to cite some definitions for each of the 8 विकृतिपाठ from Vedic literature, in Sanskrit if any.
