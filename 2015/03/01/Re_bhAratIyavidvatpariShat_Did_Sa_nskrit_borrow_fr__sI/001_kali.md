Pranams to all scholars!

  

With no offence meant to any views expressed in this subject, I am just wondering why we are persisting with the Aryan-Non-Aryan divide in the development of languages while the AIT theory stands discredited historically. Could it not be couched in some other meaningful expression? I am just thinking aloud.
