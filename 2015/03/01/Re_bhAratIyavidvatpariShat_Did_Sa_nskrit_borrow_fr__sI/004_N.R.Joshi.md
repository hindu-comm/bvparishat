Dear Shree Kali,



I raised the question about Mleccha words in Mimamsa. I am not devoted to anycampof AIT or OIT. My inquiry is academic for language only without any political color.



And one cannot divide the ancient history into modern day groups of AIT and OIT. There are many shades in between. Thanks. NRJOSHI

Pranams to all scholars!



With no offence meant to any views expressed in this subject, I am just wondering why we are persisting with the Aryan-Non-Aryan divide in the development of languages while the AIT theory stands discredited historically. Could it not be couched in some other meaningful expression? I am just thinking aloud.
