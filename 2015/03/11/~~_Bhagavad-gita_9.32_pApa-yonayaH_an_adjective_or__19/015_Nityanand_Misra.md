Also to be noted here is Śrī Rāmānuja’s commentary which seemingly takes pāpayonayaḥ different from striyaḥ, etc. Although the *Tātparyacandrikā* explains otherwise, several published translations of Śrī Rāmānuja’s commentary take pāpayonayaḥ different from striyaḥ, etc.

Original commentary of Śrī Rāmānuja: स्त्रियो वैश्याः शूद्राश्च पापयोनयोऽपि मां व्यपाश्रित्य परां गतिं यान्ति ...  

Hindi translation by Harikṛṣṇadāsa Goyandakā (1954):स्त्रियाँ, वैश्य, शूद्र, और पापयोनि वाले जीव भी मेरी शरण लेकर परम गति को प्राप्त हो जाते हैं।

English translation by Swami Adidevananda (1999):Women, Vaisyas and Sudras, and even those who are of sinful birth, can attain the supreme state by taking refuge in Me.

English translation by Śrī Rāma Rāmānuja Ācārī (2013):By taking refuge in Me even those of unfavourable birth, women, vaiśyas and also śūdras attain the supreme state.

Reference: Śrī Rāma Rāmānuja Ācārī (2013). Śrīmad Bhagavad Gītā with Gītā Bhāṣya of Bhagavad Rāmānujācārya. Srimatham website. p. 117. [Link](http://www.srimatham.com/uploads/5/5/4/9/5549439/ramanuja_gita_bhashya.pdf).

Śrī Vallabhācārya’s commentary also takes pāpayonayaḥ different from striyaḥ, etc. As per his commentary, pāpayonayaḥ stands for the likes of putanā, hūṇa-s, yavana-s śabara-s, pulinda-s etc, while striyaḥ indicates vrajavanitā-s.  

Please also note that a change in order (*Anvayabheda*) is not the same as splitting of a sentence (*Vākyabheda)*. The two are independent of each other.Śrī Rāmānuja's commentary has a change in order but still has a change in order and yet no splitting of sentence.

स्त्रियो वैश्याः शूद्राश्च पापयोनयोऽपि मां व्यपाश्रित्य परां गतिं यान्ति किं पुनः पुण्ययोनयो ब्राह्मणा राजर्षयश्च मद्भक्तिमास्थिताः।
