dear vidvaj-janas,  
  

my pranamas again.  
  

i am a little concerned to see that the topic is slowly drifting towards a discussion on whether stri are included in pApa-yoni or not. This was not the original intention of my post.  
  

The intention of my post was to figure out reasons for including vaiśyas into pApa-yoni.  
  

Nityananda ji, you correctly said that Krishna was born of Devaki and vasudeva, but there is also a parallel understanding that Krishna is nanda-nandana and was born from the womb of Yashoda, whereas four handed Vāsudeva form was born of devaki and vasudeva. This is the understanding of the Vrindavan acharyas. When Vasudev bought Krishna to Gokula, four armed Vāsudeva merged with the two armed krishna (who was born from Yashoda). When krishna left Vrindavan, the vāsudeva expansion left Vrindavan, but not nanda-nandana krishna. Sri Jiva Goswami gives various pramāṇas for this by quoting Krishna's words — 'vrindāvanaṁ parityajya padam ekaṁ na gacchati'.  
  
In defense of what you said, it can be argued that the speaker of Bhagavad-gītā was not nanda-nandana krishna but vāsudeva-krishna. Even if that is the case, still there seems to be no reason for saying that vaiśya is pāpa-yoni.  
  

I would request everyone to kindly see some questions and answers on this topic compiled by Gita-press. I found them yesterday while researching this topic. I have attached them to this reply.  
  

Also, some commentators like Sri Madhusudan Saraswati have said that vaiśyas are pāpa-yoni because they are engaged only in agriculture (kṛṣyādi). Now 'kṛṣi-go-rakṣa-vāṇijyam' is vaiśya-karma-svabhāvaja according to the Bhagavad-gītā. How can the vaiśya-sva-dharma of kṛṣi, go-rakṣā and suitable vāṇijya become a cause of pāpa? That is what i find to be not so convincing. The arguments given by Gita-press for keeping pāpa-yonī as a separate category however, I find more appealing.  
  

I would request sincerely the members to kindly discuss from the point of view of vaiśyas only and not strī. If someone wants to discuss the aspect of strī-jāti, I would request that it be done in a separate topic.
