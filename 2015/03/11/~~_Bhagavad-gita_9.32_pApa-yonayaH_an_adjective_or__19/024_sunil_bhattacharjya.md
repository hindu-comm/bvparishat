Even the Yashoda-nandan (in reality the foster son of Yashoda) Krishna had shown his four hands, when the need arose. While marrying Lakshmanaa, the Lord transformed to four-handed Krishna to take care of his newly-wedded wife with two hands and to fight the enemies with the other two hands. So there is no doubt that there was only one Krishna.
