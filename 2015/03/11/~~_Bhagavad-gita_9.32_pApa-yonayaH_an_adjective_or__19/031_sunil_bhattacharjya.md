Namaste,  
  

Kindly permit me to add a few lines to qualify the following statement.  

  

**Quote**

  
Shaunaka's charana-vyuha talks of 'fallen Brahmins' from the 'Dharma Shastra standards (more specifically those disqualified for invitation to take part of Shraaddha offering) are identified as 'aabhira' bhill' and the other categories of society.

**Unquote**.  
  
Manu also says that the physicians and the astrologers should not be invited to accept the Shraddha offerings. . That does not mean that the professions of the physicians and the astrologers are, by any means, degraded professions. Even among the gods the Ashwini-kumaras were initially denied their share of the offerings, but eventually they did become entitled. Dhanvantari, the god of Ayurveda, himself was an avatara of Lord Vishnu. The reason for not inviting these professionals to the Shraddha was for the simple reason that they had good professional income and only the poor brahmins without such professional income were to be invited to the shraddhas.  

  

Regards,
