Namaste  
  

I think the idea conveyed in the above commentary is: the vaiśya dharma is not a cause of pāpa but an effect of earlier pāpa in a non-vaiśya janma. The purport of all this is: when one is in a janma that confers a very high opportunity to do sādhana but does not utilize it, implying that he engages in pāpa, he is born in a lower janma where the earlier-janma possibility for sādhana is not available. That is the effect of the papa done in the earlier higher janma. Therefore in the stated vaiśya janma the need to be very much engaged in kṛṣi, etc. and therefore not enough time for spiritual study, mananam, etc. is reduced to that extent compared to an earlier higher-janma.  
  

Despite all this, the Lord has also stated that स्वे स्वे कर्मण्यभिरतः संसिद्धिं लभते नरः । The greatness of those enumerated in the 9.32 is that they have, despite their natural disadvantage have put in extraordinary efforts and attained the supreme. That is evident from the next verse 'kim punarbrāhmaṇāḥ.... One can also recall the 'api chet sudurācāro bhajate mām ananyabhāk sādhureva sa mantavyaḥ, samyagvyavasito his saḥ. of the BG which also brings out the greatness of extraordinary effort despite adverse circumstances.
