Also, what is considered as puNyaphala or paapaphala also depends on the phalaseeker's/phalaexperiencer's perspective.



People talk of Svarga and enjoying the dances by Apsaras as puNyaphala. Does a viraagi consider that as puNyaphala? He doesn't and hence he doesn't get it too.



A financially poor Brahmin who is not spiritually oriented may consider his financial poverty as a result of his puraajanmakrta paapa only.



A money-oriented home-maker may consider her neighbour's richness as a result of the neighbour's puraajanmakrta puNya and her own relative poverty as a result of her puraajanmakrta paapa only.



Bh.G.9-32 and 9-33 are written, as vidwan V. Subrahmanianji has already pointed out,from the perspective of opportunity for saadhana as puNyaphala. That is why ब्राह्मणाः andराजर्षयः are considered पुण्याः. It is from such a perspective that the other births where there is no natural ( vihitain the case of Brahmins vratasiddha in the case of Rajarshis) opportunity for saadhana are being considered as paapayonayah.



9-32 says that even such persons with a natural deprivation of opportunity for saadhana through their concerted efforts and endeavour get paraagati.



As Nagaraj earlier and Prof.Korada recently pointed out, the taatparya of 9-32 and 9-33 together isnot to enlist, describe, define or condemn paapayonayah, but it is to motivate all manushyas through Arjunatowards an aversion for loka which is anitya and asukha and towardsbhagavadaas'raya and bhagavadbhajanawith an assurance of paraagati as a reward.
