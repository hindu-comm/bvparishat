This is astounding. There cannot be manifoldness at the paaramaarthika level and thus it doesn’t stand to philosophical scrutiny that “all the jeevas are akin to fallen ones” strictly from Shankar’s standpoint.  
  
The biggest problem one faces with respect to Shankar’s philosophy is switching between these two levels. Agree upon something at the vyaavahaarika level and then take up diametrically opposite view at the paaramaarthika level. The ease with which it is done \[switching between the levels\] is amazing.  
  
‘Sookshma sharira’ is not gender-less is what I have heard. Here what puzzles one is that gender-less soul coming in to being either as male or female. This is like saying neem tree giving out mango and vice-a- versa. Here the ‘seed’ either of the neem or mango considered as gender-less soul.

\>Dear friends,  
  
There is a difference between how the great Madhvacharya looked at things and how the Great Shankaracharya looked at things. Both are right from their own perspectives.  
  
It is quite alright for the former and his followers to think that yonirjanma is paapa-hetuka. In that sense only an ajonijaa-birth alone will belong to nispaapajyoni. However, for Adi Shankaracharya the above thinking may be similar at the Vyavahaarika level, yet at the Paramaarthika level all the Jivas are akin to the fallen ones and one can rise above it only after attaining the samyak-jnaana (i.e. after the realization of "Aham Bhamasmi")  and thus getting out of the cycle of birth and death altogether. As regards the "Stree-janma" one should remember what the Great Kapil-muni taught to his mother. The soul has no gender and a man can take birth as woman or a woman can take birth as man, depending on their attitude to each other. Spiritual progress is all about attaining the samyak-jnaana.

\> In Śrī Śaṅkarācārya’s commentary, the word pāpayonayaḥ is taken with not only Vaiśya-s, but all three – women, Vaiśya-s and Śūdra-s. Here is the full text from The Bhagavadgita with Eleven Commentaries (1936, Gujarati Printing Press, Volume II, p. 194): मां हि यस्मात्पार्थ व्यपाश्रित्य मामाश्रयत्वेन गृहीत्वा येऽपि स्युर्भवेयुः पापयोनयः पापा योनिर्येषां ते पापयोनयः पापजन्मानः। के त इत्याह — स्त्रियो वैश्यास्तथा शूद्रास्तेऽपि यान्ति गच्छन्ति परां गतिं प्रकृष्टां गतिम्॥ Link: <https://archive.org/stream/Srimad.Bhagavad-Gita.with.Eleven.Commentaries.by.Shastri.Gajanana.Shambhu.Sandha/Srimad-Bhagavad-Gita.with.Eleven.Commentaries#page/n839/mode/1up>  
  
  
  
I believe that in Madhva’s tradition the पापयोनयः is not meant as a generic adjective to qualify स्त्रियः, etc. For one thing, such a broad condemnation of womenfolk, etc., is hardly sensible. To the extent that the connection is to be made, it is presented as applying where someone obtains a birth lower than natural, as a result of sin (e.g., Yama being born as the śūdra Vidura on account of the curse of the sage Māṇḍavya) — even such a person is emancipated. The explanation of Śrī Rāghavendra, following the lead of Madhva’s citation, is as follows.  
  
  
  
मां हीत्यादिना \| हे पार्थ पापयोनयः स्वयमुत्तमवर्णा अपि पापहेतुका योनिर्जन्म येषां ते पापयोनयः \| ते क इत्यत उक्तं \| स्त्रिय इत्यादिना \| स्वतः पुमांसोऽपि पापात्सुद्युम्नस्येलात्वमिव    स्त्रीत्वं प्राप्ता ये च स्वतो ब्राह्मणादिरपि पापाद्वैश्यादिहीनवर्णतां प्राप्ताः शूद्रत्वं वा प्राप्ताः मामाश्रित्य स्युः वर्तेरन् \| मयि भक्तिमन्तो भवेयुः तेऽपि परां गतिं यान्ति \|\|९.३२\|\|

\> Apart from Abhinavagupta and others, in the Advaita tradition itself, some later commentators have differed with Śaṅkarācārya in the Anvaya and interpretation of the term pāpayonayaḥ. Madhusūdana Sarasvatī, Śrīdhara Svāmī and Veṅkaṭanātha take the word pāpayonayaḥ separately and interpret it as for Antyaja-s and Tiryak-s (e.g. Niṣāda-s), and not as a qualifier for the three groups of women, Vaiśya-s and Śūdra-s.
