Also to be noted is that the word 'pāpayonayaḥ' does not guarantee that there are no stri-s in it. There is no rule that only men can be pāpayonis. It is definitely possible that this group contains women too. So, the effort to not bring in the common class of women into the group / adjective pāpayoni-s will not succeed. Hence, one can always object that women are included in the group of pāpayonis in whichever way the words in the verse are arranged.  
  

The śrīmadbhāgavatam has this verse:

दैतेया यक्षरक्षांसि स्त्रियः शूद्रा व्रजौकसः ।

खगा मृगाः पापजीवाः सन्ति ह्यच्युततां गताः ॥ 7.7.54

The verse groups all the different classes enumerated as ‘pāpajīvāḥ’ which is only another expression for ‘pāpayonayaḥ’ of the BG 9.32. The inclusion of women, shūdras and the people of vraja in the group is noteworthy. Even if one would like to say the ‘pāpajīvāḥ’ is a class by itself, the grouping of women, etc. along with these, to the exclusion of brahmanas, kshatriyas and vaishyas, is significant that all these entities listed are admitted to be devoid of means for spiritual sāḍhana in their natural lives but owing to their special effort have risen to the high state of immortality, the state of achyuta.

makes the following objection:

  

  

// In both cases (Ramanuja and Shankara), there is no clue how to avoid equating those category people and pāpayonis. //
