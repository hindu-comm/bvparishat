Namaste  
  

Is it possible to exclude stryaḥ completely from the above class of people? For instance, there is a twin-verse cited by Swami Vidyāraṇya in the Jīvanmukti viveka - vāsanākṣayaprakaraṇam, from the Laghu Yoga Vāsiṣṭha 19.16,17 (incidentally, I found these verses in the Nāradaparivrājakopaniṣat on a google search (not giving the URL):  
  
  
सा कालपुत्रपदवी सा माहावीचिवागुरा।  
सासिपत्रवनश्रेणी या देहेऽहमिति स्थितिः॥४९॥  
  
सा त्याज्या सर्वयत्नेन सर्वनाशेऽप्युपस्थिते।  
स्प्रष्टव्या सा न भव्येन *सश्वमांसेव पुल्कसी*॥५०॥  
  

And another verse stated as ’भगवान् शेष आह -  
तीर्थे *श्वपचगृहे* वा नष्टस्मृतिरपि परित्यजन्देहम्.  
ज्ञानसमकालमुक्तः कैवल्यं याति हतशोकः ।।८०।।  
  

The above verse is also found in other texts, on a google search: paramārthasāram.  
  

So, in the class of pāpayoni-s listed above (where the women were excluded and read along with vaishyas, etc.) the possibility of the feminine gender cannot be ruled out. In the absence of that gender there cannot be those groups thriving. Thus, one who objects to the inclusion of women in the pāpa yoni category of the BG 9.32 cannot avoid objecting to their presence in the groups mentioned above.  
  
Just as Shankara, Sri Raghavendra Tirtha’s vivṛti too uses the ‘के ते?’ and includes all the categories listed in the verse: strī, vaiśya and śūdra under the ‘pāpayonayaḥ’. 

As stated above, there is no such avoidance needed or else the Lord would not have even mentioned those categories along with the qualifier, as shown by the Dhanapati Suri’s commentary. In fact, Sri Raghavendra Tirtha explicitly equates these category people with pāpayonis.  

  

The purport of the BG 9.32 and 33 as per *all the three bhāṣya-s* waters down to saying: निकृष्टत्वं पापनिबन्धनम्, उत्कृष्टत्वं पुण्यहेतुकम् (as pointed out by Dhanapati sūri). In fact the ‘vivṛti’ by Sri Raghavendra Tirtha (9.30) holds that the verses in consideration are a ‘bhakta praśamsā’ (a eulogy of devotees) kriyate api-chedityādinā (from the verse 9.30 onwards). He continues in 9.32: bhaktermahimānamāha mām hītyādinā – The Lord is giving out the greatness of the devotee by the words ‘He indeed…’. And the commentator gives the definition of pāpayoniḥ as ‘svayamuttamavarṇāḥ api *pāpahetukam janma yeṣām te’* (‘Even though they are of higher caste, *their birth is due to sin*’). 
He also says: ‘*pāpādvaiśyādihīnavarṇatām’*…(‘vaiśya etc. low caste caused by pāpa). This is not any different from Shankara
पापजन्मानस्तेऽपि. So, the recognition of these births as ‘lowly’ and as caused by sin is a common factor across the bhāṣyas.

  

The Br.up. says: पुण्यो वै पुण्येन कर्मणा भवति पापः पापेनेति । ततो *ह* जारत्कारव आर्तभाग उपरराम ॥ ३,२.१३ ॥

\[(Therefore) one indeed becomes *good* through good work and *evil* through evil work.\]



In the bhāṣyam Shankara says:



कर्म हैव आश्रयं पुनःपुनःकार्यकरणोपादानहेतुम् (body-mind-organs complex) तत् तत्र ऊचतुः उक्तवन्तौ — न केवलम् ; कालकर्मदैवेश्वरेष्वभ्युपगतेषु हेतुषु यत्प्रशशंसतुस्तौ, कर्म हैव तत्प्रशशंसतुः — यस्मान्निर्धारितमेतत् कर्मप्रयुक्तं ग्रहातिग्रहादिकार्यकरणोपादानं पुनः पुनः, तस्मात् पुण्यो वै शास्त्रविहितेन पुण्येन कर्मणा भवति, तद्विपरीतेन विपरीतो भवति पापः पापेन —



\[*There *they mentioned *.only work *as the support which caused the repeated taking' of the body and organs. Not only this; having accepted time, work, destiny and God as causes, *what they praised there was also only work. *Since it is decided that the repeated taking of the body and organs, known also as the Gra,as and Atigrahas, is due to work, therefore *one indeed becomes good through good work *enjoined by the scriptures, *and *becomes its opposite, *evil, through *the opposite or *evil work.*\]



The Upaniṣad itself calls the one who is endowed with ‘pāpam’ as ‘pāpaḥ’ (in the masculine, while pāpam = sin, is neuter), and one with ‘puṇyam’ as ‘puṇyaḥ’. We can see this usage in the BG 9.33 too ‘puṇyāḥ’ in the plural to qualify the brāḥmaṇas, etc.
