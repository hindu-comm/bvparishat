Dear friends,  
  
There is a difference between how the great Madhvacharya looked at things and how the Great Shankaracharya looked at things. Both are right from their own perspectives.  
  
It is quite alright for the former and his followers to think that yonirjanma is paapa-hetuka. In that sense only an ajonijaa-birth alone will belong to nispaapajyoni. However, for Adi Shankaracharya the above thinking may be similar at the Vyavahaarika level, yet at the Paramaarthika level all the Jivas are akin to the fallen ones and one can rise above it only after attaining the samyak-jnaana (i.e. after the realization of "Aham Bhamasmi")  and thus getting out of the cycle of birth and death altogether. As regards the "Stree-janma" one should remember what the Great Kapil-muni taught to his mother. The soul has no gender and a man can take birth as woman or a woman can take birth as man, depending on their attitude to each other. Spiritual progress is all about attaining the samyak-jnaana.  
  

Regards,
