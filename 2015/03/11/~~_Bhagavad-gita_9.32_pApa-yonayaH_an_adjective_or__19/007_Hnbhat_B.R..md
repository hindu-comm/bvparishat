Prof. Korada has correctly interpreted with the logic of शास्त्रप्रामाण्य, and one can follow his own logic connecting the words as he likes.

  

But even in the case of one can connect the two verses, there is the simple contrast between the two verses by the expressions, applicable to both separately, पापयोनयः applicable to the first half only and in contrast with पुण्याः, and I could not understand why Mr. Haridas failed to noticed this.

  

It can be applicable to पुण्या राजर्षयः, ब्राह्मणाः, who were born as the result of the accrued पुण्य, in contrast with पापयोनयः listed in the first verse who had their present birth due to the accrued पाप. This is called the एकवाक्यता, in शास्त्र-s. The simple translation will be when the पापयोनि-sand पुण्याः will take the same cannotation than condemning the caste or वर्ण specifically. So When those who are born as the result of their accrued पाप, (like स्रियः etc.) are also eligible to get the final salvation, what to say about those पुण्ययोनि-s like ब्राह्मण, राजर्षि etc. will get the salvation?

  

This is the common logic by the structure and the relation of the two sentences. We need not to create a class among them as पापयोनि-s and पुण्ययोनि-s separately, considering these these two adjectives (applicable to all the nouns listed in both the verses) without any specific purpose for it. One connect as one likes and make a chaos from the verse.

  

I think this is what Prof. Korada wanted to convey in short.
