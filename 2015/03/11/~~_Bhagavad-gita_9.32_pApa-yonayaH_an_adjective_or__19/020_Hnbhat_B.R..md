What is your interest in excluding or including वैश्य-s only among those listed in the verse?

  

The question is the same, whether पापयोनयः is to be related with each of the members in the list or taken as a separate group in addition to स्त्री etc. If it is to be related with each of the members, it could not be done with any one of the group, but to all the members of the group or not related, it has to be taken as a separate class, not included in the list. The crux of the problem lies in this and not only with वैश्य.
