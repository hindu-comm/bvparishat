Firstly, there is nothing called the “Vaiśya caste.” There is a difference between Varṇa and caste. Secondly, Lord Kṛṣṇa did not *appear* in a Vaiśya family. Vasudeva and Devakī were both Kṣatriya-s in the Yādava clan, so he appeared in a Kṣatriya family only. He was brought up in a Vaiśya family though as Nanda and Yaśodā were Vaiśya-s.

In Śrī Śaṅkarācārya’s commentary, the word *pāpayonayaḥ* is taken with not only Vaiśya-s, but all three – women, Vaiśya-s and Śūdra-s. Here is the full text from *The Bhagavadgita with Eleven Commentaries* (1936, Gujarati Printing Press, Volume II, p. 194):मां हि यस्मात्पार्थ व्यपाश्रित्य मामाश्रयत्वेन गृहीत्वा येऽपि स्युर्भवेयुः पापयोनयः पापा योनिर्येषां ते पापयोनयः पापजन्मानः। के त इत्याह — स्त्रियो वैश्यास्तथा शूद्रास्तेऽपि यान्ति गच्छन्ति परां गतिं प्रकृष्टां गतिम्॥Link: <https://archive.org/stream/Srimad.Bhagavad-Gita.with.Eleven.Commentaries.by.Shastri.Gajanana.Shambhu.Sandha/Srimad-Bhagavad-Gita.with.Eleven.Commentaries#page/n839/mode/1up>

Here is the \[accurate\] English translation of Śaṅkarācārya’s commentary by A. Mahādeva Śāstrī (1901, Mysore, p. 232):*For, finding refuge in Me, they also who, O son of Pritha, may be of a sinful birth—women, vaisyas as well as sudras, — even they attain to the Supreme Goal.*Link: <https://archive.org/stream/bhagavadgitawith00maharich#page/232/mode/1up>

Apart from Abhinavagupta and others, in the Advaita tradition itself, some later commentators have differed with Śaṅkarācārya in the *Anvaya* and interpretation of the term *pāpayonayaḥ*. Madhusūdana Sarasvatī, Śrīdhara Svāmī and Veṅkaṭanātha take the word *pāpayonayaḥ* separately and interpret it as for *Antyaja*-s and *Tiryak*-s (e.g. *Niṣāda*-s), and not as a qualifier for the three groups of women, Vaiśya-s and Śūdra-s. The subtle difference of opinion expressed by Madhusūdana Sarasvatī and Śrīdhara Svāmī is not lost to the reader. In the *Bhāṣyotkarṣadīpikā*, Dhanapati quotes Madhusūdana Sarasvatī's interpretation verbatim and opposes him, defending Śaṅkarācārya’s original Anvaya. Dhanapati claims, without citing any authority, that Vaiśya-s are to be understood as Brāhmaṇa-s or Kṣatriya-s in previous births born as Vaiśya-s in current birth due to sinful Karma:  

वैश्या अपि पूर्वजन्मनि ब्राह्मणाः क्षत्रिया वा पापकर्मणा वैश्ययोनिमापन्नाः कृष्यादिरता ग्राह्याः.And further Dhanapati makes the following \[debatable and controversial\] statement to defend the Anvaya of Śaṅkarācārya:तथा च स्त्रियादीनां निकृष्टत्वेन पापयोनित्वावश्यकत्वेनेदमेव पापयोनय इति पदं स्त्रियादौ सम्बध्यते.
