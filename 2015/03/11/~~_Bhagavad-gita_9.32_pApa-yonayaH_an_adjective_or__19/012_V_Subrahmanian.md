In deference to Sri H.N.Bhat ji's latest post, I am limiting my response to just a few points, including the one above:  
  

For Advaitins the svabhāva of the jiva has no gender whatsoever as per the Shvetashvataropaniṣad 5.10:

The jīva is neither feminine nor masculine nor the third gender.
Whichever body it takes it assumes that gender.

  

Bhāṣyam

Being of the nature of the non-dual, secondless Brahman-Atman that is the innermost Self, the jīva is neither feminine nor masculine nor of the third gender. Whichever body it assumes, it takes upon itself, due to wrong identification, the gender of the body which expresses itself as ‘I am stout, lean, man, woman, third-gender’.   

  

Here is a quote from a contemporary author's book, cited in a discussion group:

//According to Prof. SK Bhavani, this verse was historically reflecting the prevalent views when the Gita was composed.  



I quote him here - (page 313, The Bhagavad Gita and its classical commentaries) "All the same, one finds women, Vaishyas and Shudras spoken of in the text as 'of sinful birth' - pApayonayaH - as distinguished from Brahmins and devoted royal sages who are called puNyAH - of holy birth. Such discrimination is bound to offend the susceptibilities of modern commentators and exponents of the Gita. But it must be remembered that the Gita is reflecting the views prevalent at the time of its composition and that it cannot be expected to have set them at defiance. It has of course made all possible attempts within the framework of ancient tradition to liberalise the outlook as far as possible, without advocating an open break from the traditional beliefs like Buddhism and Jainism. We should therefore understand the limitations of the Gita in this respect and not expect too much of modernism from it."//

Prof. Bhavani, I think, is the son of late Dr.B.N.K.Sharma, who has authored a number of books on Dvaita Vedanta in English.
