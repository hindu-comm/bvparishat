The above also doesn't separate पापयोनयः from the remaining, as adjectives could follow or precede the nouns they are applied. Only the other possibility is

  

स्त्रियो वैश्याः शूद्रा पापयोनयश्चापि would mean women, vaishya, shudra and also पापयोनि-s. There is two conjuncts च and अपि and placing them may change the meaning as a whole. Otherwise, it doesn't change as quoted in the commentaries above.
