1\. jeeva is not the same as sookshma s'areera.



2\. The two s'lokas under discussion are not connected to these ideas of jeeva or sookshma s'areera.



3\. Simply because S'ankara's words are being discussed, the advaitic concepts of vyaavahaarika and paaramaarthika sattaas need not be brought for discussion every time.



4\. S'ankara's words in his commentary on 9-32, 9-33 are not necessarily connected essentially to his advaitic stance.



5\. The two verses 9-32, 9-33 are about the benefit ofbhagavadaas'raya and bhagavadbhajana. In fact9-32 is saying all kinds of humans (manushyas)are eligible for paraa gati . No human (manushya)is ineligible for the 'ultimate gati' (moksha).



6\. S'ankara in his commentary on 9-33 is talking about पुरुषार्थसाधनं दुर्लभं मनुष्यत्वम् , मनुष्यत्वम् in general. Arjuna is neither a Brahmana nor a Rajarshi. He is a manushya. S'ankara's commentary on 9-33 is talking about that manushyatva.



7\. Taatparya of 9-32 and 9-33 together isto motivate all manushyastowards bhagavadaas'raya and bhagavadbhajanaby telling that it helps all humans to get paraam gati irrespective of their pre-birth puNya or paapa.



8\. All theremaining analysis of who are paapayonis doesn't alter this taatparya.
