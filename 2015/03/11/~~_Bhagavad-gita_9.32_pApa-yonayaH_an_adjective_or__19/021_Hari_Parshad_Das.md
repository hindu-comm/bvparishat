\>\> If the discussion starts focusing on stri-jāti, eventually shastric quotes for/against women's eligibility will be bought up, and this may spoil the taste of the discussion. I do believe that such a discussion will be non-ending, and nobody will be able to reach a all-agreeable conclusion on the topic of stri-jāti. Therefore, I want to suggest that the context be limited to discussing 'vaiśya-jāti' only, because the chances of reaching an all-agreeable conclusion is greater in that case (in my opinion).
