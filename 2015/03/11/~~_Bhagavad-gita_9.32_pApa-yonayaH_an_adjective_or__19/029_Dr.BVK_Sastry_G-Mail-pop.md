Namaste  
  
Can the word ' papa-yoni', be looked at from different perspectives of (a) Ayurveda (b) other texts - of tradition which speaks about 'Varna-bhrmasha and (c ) last and not the least -within Gita context itself ?  
  
Here are some pointers, which may point to clarify the 'negative mode of presenting Gita in global society, especially about denial of opportunities for women in the realm of spiritual final goal and within Indian society, the \< profession of a brahmana in non-vaidik domains and places? and 'large section of ' Spirituality practices and goals recommended for non-brahminical population of India. \>  
  
The concept of 'papa-yoni' - is also deliberated in Ayurveda works, pointing to body -defects ( male and female - related to reproduction and child births) and hereditary deficiencies. Fits well with the part of word explanation \< पापा योनिर्येषां ते पापयोनयः \> a pointer to Women of profession, which resonates to Gita -1st chapter \<streesu dushtaasu .... varna-sankarah>- One of the feared consequences of war, feared consequences of debauched life style.  
  
Shaunaka's charana-vyuha talks of 'fallen Brahmins' from the 'Dharma Shastra standards (more specifically those disqualified for invitation to take part of Shraaddha offering) are identified as 'aabhira' bhill' and the other categories of society. These seem to fit in to the word explanation \< पापयोनयः = पापजन्मानः> - those whose inheritance as Karma/ poorva paripaka / jeeva svabhaava-pravrutti is tainted with ' papa' and who are the seeds who trigger and cause proliferation of 'papas', by engaging in to ' taamasika karma'.  
  
In Gita context itself, if a 'yoga-bhrashta -person 'is assured of birth in a 'shucheenaam shrimataam gehe ' - which in the worldly sense, would be 'a wealthy rich religious environment of family -lineage /parentage = 'Punya-Yoni', then the opposite of this would be ' papa-yoni'. This seems to fit in to the part of the word explanation as \< येऽपि स्युर्भवेयुः पापयोनयः \> where the stress is on the verb 'bhaveyuh' - \<would be the cause of, without any binding on time and place and modality \>. The elaboration of this would be \< पापयोनयः स्वयमुत्तमवर्णा अपि पापहेतुका योनिर्जन्म येषां ते पापयोनयः \> and \< Api chet suduracharo bhajate mam-ananyabhak. Sadhureva sa mantavyah samyag-vyavasito hi sah (IX-30)>. And (7-29) \< jara-marana-mokshaya mam asritya yatanti ye te brahma tad viduh krtsnam adhyatmam karma cakhilam \>.  
  
  
It seems different Acharyas have endorsed the intent of Gita from different perspectives, without loosing the key message \< maam ashritya yatanti> and the assurance of goal as \< para gatim>.
