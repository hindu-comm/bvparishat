\~\~ śrī-śrī-rādhā-dāmodarāya namaḥ \~\~  
  
dear vidvaj-janas,  
  
pranamas.  
  
There is a question which pops up while reading commentaries on Bhagavad-gītā 9.32 is as follows:  
  
The various commentators interpret the term pāpa-yonayaḥ in different ways. Some say that the term 'pāpa-yonayaḥ' refers to a separate category besides strī-śūdra-vaiśya (as Sri Sridhar Swami and many other scholars have interpreted) and some others say that the term 'pāpa-yonayaḥ' is an adjective applied to strī-śūdra-vaiśya (as Sri Adi Shankaracharya and many others have interpreted). Sri Abhinavagupta says that pāpa-yonayaḥ refers to a separate category of animals, like Gajendra who got liberation by the Lord's kṛpā.  
  
**The question here is** — If the interpretation of Sri Adi Shankara is accepted, how can vaiśyas be considered as pāpa-yonī, especially when they are dvijas and are born from anuloma marriage? Although Krishna is the Supreme Lord and beyond varṇāśrama, he too seemingly appeared in the vaiśya caste. How can he call his own caste as a pāpa-yonī?  
  
This question made me think that maybe pāpa-yonī is better to be kept as a separate category, away from the remaining three.  
  
Any thoughts by the vidvānas?  
  
sādhu-caraṇa-rajo 'bhilāṣī,  
  
hari pārṣada dāsa.
