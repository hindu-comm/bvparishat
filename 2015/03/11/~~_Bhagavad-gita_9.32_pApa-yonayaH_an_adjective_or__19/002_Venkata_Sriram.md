Namaste,

  

shrI madhusudana saraswathi in "gUDArthadIpika" mentions an additional word in describing the swa-dharma

of vaiSya as "vaishyAH kruSyAdimAtraratAH" ie., owing to this birth as vaishya, their maximum time is spent in kriSi and gO samrakSaNa due to which they have very little time for vEda adhyayana.

  

Since, they are away from "vEda-adhyayayana" and the "sadAchAra", the word "pApa-yOni" has been used which is not to be taken in derogatory sense.

  

In the subsequent sloka, shrI madhusudana uses the word "sadAchAri" for brAhmaNa and "sUkSma vastu vivEkinaH" for kSatriya. However, in the earlier one, He uses "kruSyAdimAtraratAH". 

  

The conclusion to be taken here is "na vAsudEva bhaktAnAM ashubhaM vidyatE kvachit".

  

regs,

sriram
