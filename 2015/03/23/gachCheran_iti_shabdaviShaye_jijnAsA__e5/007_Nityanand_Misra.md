A usage similar to यास्ये is गमिष्ये which is seen at multiple places in the Rāmāyaṇa, e.g.

1) गमिष्ये राममादाय (३.३८.११)

<https://archive.org/stream/ValmikiRamayana/Aranyakanda_III#page/n169/mode/1up>

2) गमिष्ये यत्र काकुत्स्थः (३.४५.३३)

<https://archive.org/stream/ValmikiRamayana/Aranyakanda_III#page/n199/mode/2up>

3) गमिष्ये यत्र वैदेही (५.१.१५८)

<https://archive.org/stream/ValmikiRamayana/Sundarakanda_V#page/n25/mode/1up>

4) गमिष्ये यत्र राघवः (६.११३.४६)

<https://archive.org/stream/ValmikiRamayana/Yuddhakanda_VI#page/n619/mode/1up>

The form expected in Pāṇinian system is गमिष्यामि and not गमिष्ये.Even if one accounts for ātmanepada by 1-3-29 समो गम्यृच्छिभ्याम्, the form expected is सङ्गंस्ये and not सङ्गमिष्ये due to the rule 7-2-58 गमेरिट् परस्मैपदेषु which ordains the augment इट् when a paramaipada (explained in commentaries as non-ātmanepada) suffix follows.

How does one then explain Vālmīki’s multiple usage of गमिष्ये? The commentaries do not explain the usage. One option obviously is to take it as pre-Pāṇinian/non-Pāṇinian usage. The other is to look for solutions in Pāṇinian framework, and in this approach, a possible solution is replacement of मिप् by इट् following 3-1-85 व्यत्ययो बहुलम्.
