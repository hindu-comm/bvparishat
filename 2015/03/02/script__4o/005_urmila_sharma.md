Sir! 

It is Gurumukhi script, Punjabi language, a potion of GuruGranthaSaahhibji!

Any person, specially a Sikh, may help to read this.

I am a Punjabi by birth and by mother tongue, but as I was out of Punjab since the age 6 years, I did not have opportunity to learn the Gurumukhi script. I learnt Sanskrit since 6th year till my PhD from BHU in 1970. (Now I am 70+..)

So I feel Sanskrit.as my first language, accompanied by 7 other Bhaarateeya Bhas.aas (i.e. Punjabi, Hindi, Vrajabhas.a, Avadhi, Bihari, Bengali, Gujarati, Marathi, Marwari, a little Oriya, Asami, etc. )

I enjoy the information s got from Bh.Vid.Parisat.
