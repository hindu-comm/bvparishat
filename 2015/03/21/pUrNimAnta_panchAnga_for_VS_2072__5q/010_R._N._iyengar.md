Sri Mishra ji,

Nice work, congratulations. I have a few observations:

  

1\) Generally the two ayanas, the two vis.uva and the six r.tu are also mentioned in the traditional almanacs.

2\) Some of the pancanagas provide the dates for rise and set of star Agastya

3)As per the Vis.n.upuraan.a II part chapter 8

As per this Sun at beginning of Mesha is when the day and night are equal. Similarly ( I have not quoted all the verses as the text is too long) Makara sankranti also Uttarayana is when the length of the day is the shortest. Your table very conveniently gives the time of sun rise and sun set for each day of the year for your chosen location. One can easily see that the length of the day and night are not equal on 14th April, which is shown as Mesha sankranti. But it was so on 21st March
which is not shown as "Vishuva" in your table. Is it possible to harmonize Vishnupurana definitions of Vishuva, Ayana and Rashi with your table? Do you have any thoughts on this issue. Sri Nori has also pointed out the anamoly in the solar calendar which considers vernal equinox to be around 14th April. For moon you say that the nakshatras are based on moon's longitude. For Sun what is your formula?

  

Thanks

  

RN Iyengar
