The Wikipedia article<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_calendar>is a good place to begin.

  

For a more authoritative introduction, see [Sewell and Dikshit](https://archive.org/details/indiancalendarwi00seweuoft), mainly the introductory pages (the first five or six). Thereafter the column-headings about which the query was raised would become clear.
