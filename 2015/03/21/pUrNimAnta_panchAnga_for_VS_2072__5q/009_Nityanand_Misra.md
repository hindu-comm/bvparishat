I am sorry I made a mistake. All times are in Indian Standard Time (IST) and not local time. IST corresponds to 82.5° E longitude passing through Prayāga. The Pañcāṅga is for Citrakūṭa, whose latitude is 80.83° E. The local time at Citrakūṭa is around 6 minutes and 40 seconds behind IST.  
  
(82.5 - 80.83) degrees \* 4 minutes/degree \* 60 seconds/minute = 400.8 seconds \~ 6 minutes 40 seconds.  
  
So as per the spreadsheet, on March 21, the sunrise at Citrakūṭa is at 6:09:56 AM IST (which is the time everybody follows in India) or 6:03:15 AM local time (the 'actual' time at Citrakūṭa).

Thanks, all credit to Dr. Rāmādhāra Śarmā. You may please add all of this and redistribute if you like. I currently do not have enough time to annotate all of this with the precision and perfectionism I am used to, so I will pass.  
  
The same Pañcāṅga can also be seen online on our Āśrama's website  
1) For today's Pañcāṅga the URL <http://jagadgururambhadracharya.org/panchang.php> can be used  
2) For a different date, the date argument can be provided in YYYY-MM-DD format, e.g. for March 25, 2015, type <http://jagadgururambhadracharya.org/panchang.php?date=2015-03-25>
