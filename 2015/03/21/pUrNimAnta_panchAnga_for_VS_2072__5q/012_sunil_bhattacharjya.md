Nice discussion. I wish to add one thing.  
  
There is a convention that the "tithi" of the day is the "tithi" in which the Sun rises on that day. At times there can be three tithis in a day, i.e., the Sun rises in one tithi and immediately thereafter the next tithi starts but the second ttithi is over before the next sunrise and the Sun rises in the third tithi. Those days with three tithis are not considered to be auspicious for certain rituals.  
  

There seems to be one exception to the above convention. Lord Ram was born in a Navami tithi. It appears that on the day of his birth the Sun rose in the Ashtami tithi and by the time Lord Ram was born in the noon-time (mid-day) the tithi became the Navami and we all observe the Ram-Navami.and not ram-Ashtami.  
  
Thanks,
