Ugaadi in Telugu, yugaadi in Kannada, GuDhee Paadhvaa in Marathi.



I was able to see the beauty ofGudhee PaaDhvaa while living in Pune.



Google set its browser window's image to indicate Navroz festival and the associated text says "Originated in Persia, Nowruz or **Navroz** remains a holy day for Zoroastrians and is celebrated in many parts of the world. The latest doodle is full of bright flowers and bees, symbolising the onset of Spring. In the Indian subcontinent, the festival is celebrated by Parsis, Kashmiris, and Shia Muslims."



This info gives happiness. It gives pleasure to see that in these other parts of the world people join us to celebrate the real and scientific new year.



But it is disappointing to see that Google does not mention Telugu, Kannada and Marathi celebrations.



Samvatsarapurusha is a Vedic concept.



May Samvatsarapurusha bless us all for a prosperous new year!
