Today is one of those days when both the lunar and (modern) solar new years start on the same date. The Telugu / Kannada / Marathi / Konkan new year starting today is the lunar new year; the Novruz of Iran / Afghanistan is the first day of the solar new year, which starts on the vernal equinox.

  

The first day of Chaitra does start a new year in many parts of the country - from Himachal to Manipur - but is not as well known, or known simply as Chaitra Suklaadi. In fact, even outside of what is today India, Hindus treat today or tomorrow (Sindh, Pakistan) as the start of new year. Also the name of the Samvatsara differs. In South (as per चान्द्रमान), from today we have the Manmatha-naama-samvatsara; in North (बार्हस्पत्यमान), following the Jovian cycle, it is the Keelaka-naama-samvatsara. There is a difference of 13 in the names of years - the year in North (42 - Keelaka) is 13 years ahead of South (29. Manmatha).

  

In the south-eastern belt, i.e. some parts of Kerala-TN (not officially)-Orissa-Bengal-Assam where the months are solar, the new year starts around April 14 / 15, the day of Mesha Sankranti (Vishu / Bihu). This is also true of Nepal and parts of Bihar and many other places outside India (Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Southeast Asia etc.). This is also supposed to be the vernal equinox - only as per earlier calculations.

  

Incidentally tomorrow, on March 22, the new year as per the National Calendar of India starts. This calendar is a perfect example of what happens when intellectuals in their ivory towers removed from the people make up things, and stamp them official. It is high time that the calendar followed by the majority of Indians is adopted as the National Calendar and not the "scientific" one, for a 7-day week or the start of a new year on January 1st are equally unscientific.

  

Recently Tamil Nadu Govt., maybe taking the lead from Govt. of India, started treating Pongal (Makara Sankranti) officially as the start of a new year.

  

The prevalence of solar and lunar calendars is as old as the Mahabharata. In fact the war happened because of this difference. In the reckoning of Duryodhana from Sarannavaraatri (the game of dice being played on Vijayadasamee) to Vasanatanavaraatri (the uttara-go-grahanam happens at the end of Vasanta-navaraatri), only twelve and a half years (per the solar calendar) are complete. However for Vratas, the Chaandramaana is to be followed, with the adhika-maasas occurring within the period of vrata being counted as proper months (these are not normally counted as separate months - except in the case of pregnancy, calculating interest and for reckoning the duration of vratas); and as per this reckoning thirteen years (or 156 months) were complete counting the adhika-maasas. Of course, Dharmasaastra got trumped by realpolitik later, and the great war happened.
