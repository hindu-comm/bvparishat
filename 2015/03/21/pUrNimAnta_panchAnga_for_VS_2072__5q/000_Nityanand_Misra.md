Dear list members

  

Best wishes to all for the new Saṃvatsara which begins today.

  

Please find attached the Śrīrāghavīya Pañcāṅga for Vikrama Saṃvat 2072.  

  

The Pañcāṅga is in Hindi and follows the Pūrṇimānta system prevalent in northern and eastern regions of the country. All times shown are for Citrakūṭa.  

  

The Adhika month (Āṣāḍha) starts on June 17 and ends on July 16.  

  

The Kumbha Mahāparva is at Nashik this year in Śrāvaṇa and Bhādrapada (August and September). Looking forward to seeing some of you at the Kumbha in Nashik. Or in Mumbai (close by, around 170 kms) on your way to or from Nashik.  

  

The Pañcāṅga is compiled by Dr. Rāmādhāra Śarmā (Patna) and has been proofread and copy-edited by me.

  

Thanks, Nityānanda
