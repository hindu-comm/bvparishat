As an addendum, one can cross-check the Pañcāṅga times (not for just this Pañcāṅga but for any Pañcāṅga) with the NOAA Solar Calculator on the website of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) Earth System Research Laboratory (ESRL). As an example let us take the sunrise and sunset times shown in the Pañcāṅga for the September equinox (September 23) – this would be row 188, columns N and O.

Sunrise shown is at 5:55:00 AM. Sunset shown is at 6:02:41 PM

Now let’s check the NOAA Solar Calculator under <http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/grad/solcalc/>. This calculator is the implementation of the Sunrise equation. We will need to set six parameters.

As Citrakūṭa is located at 25° N and 80.83° E, we enter the following for Location  

1\) Lat: 25

2\) Lng: 80.83

As the time zone in the Pañcāṅga is IST, we enter the following

3\) Time Zone: 5.5

Finally we choose the date

4\) Day: 23

5\) Mon: Sep

6\) Yr: 2015

Once the above six are set, the Solar Calculator shows ‘Apparent Sunrise’ at 05:55 and ‘Apparent Sunset’ at 18:03. Note the use of terms apparent which shows that the effect of atmospheric refraction is included.  

The times match with the time in the Pañcāṅga. Needless to say, the times on the NOAA Solar Calculator are rounded to the nearest minute, while the Pañcāṅga gives times with second precision.  

Also note that for September 23 2015, the duration of the ‘day’ as per the Pañcāṅga is 12 hours, 7 minutes and 41 seconds, while that of the ‘night’ is 11 hours, 52 minutes and 19 seconds. The ‘day’ is longer than the ‘night’ by 18 minutes and 18 seconds. Due to the effect of refraction, the ‘day’ is longer than the ‘night’on the equinox dates: this difference is around 14 minutesat the equator, and it increases as one goes from the Equator towards the poles.

A nice contour plot based on the solar calculator to visualize this in two dimensions is here

1\) If one draws a straight horizontal line on this chart at 25° N, it would intersect the blue vertical line showing the Autumnal equinox in the green region, which is between the 12 hour and 14 hour contours.  

2) One can also see the intersection points of the straight horizontal line on this chart at 25° N with the 12 hour contours. The intersection points correspond to middle of March and late September. As per the Pañcāṅga, the dates with smallest difference of day and night are September 28 2015 and March 15 2016. These are the dates where the ‘apparent duration of day’ would be closest to 12 hours.

Hope this lays to rest any speculations about the accuracy of thePañcāṅga.
