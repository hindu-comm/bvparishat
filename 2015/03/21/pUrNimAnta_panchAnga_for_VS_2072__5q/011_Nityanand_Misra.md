Thanks for the kind words, I will pass them on to Dr. Rāmādhāra Śarmā.

Yes, these are not shown that in the Excel. We will be sharing a PDF version soon which shows the Ayanas. We have not shown the Viṣuvas also.

Yes, they are not done here. As per Dr. Śarmā, it is not relevant as the rainy season now does not exactly coincide with the rise/setting of Agastya.

This Pañcāṅga follows the Nirayana system with sidereal longitudes, not the Sāyana system with tropical longtidues. Hence there is a difference of 24 days in the date we mark as Meṣa Saṅkrānti (April 14) and the March equinox (March 21). I do not want to get involved into any Nirayana versus Sāyana debates on this thread and will not be responding to any further questions.  
  
We have not shown the Viṣuvas as mentioned earlier. Also, the sunrise and sunset times shown in our Pañcāṅga are without the correction for atmospheric refraction, so the equinox dates as per the Pañcāṅga do not coincide with actual equinox dates this year but are off by a few days.

As far as my limited knowledge is concerned, the difference between sidereal and tropical longitude coming from axial precession (which causes precession of equinoxes) explains this difference. For some historians, this could give one of the possible dates for composition of Viṣṇupurāṇa, this may be discussed in a separate thread, I am not interested in the same.

I will also forward this email to Dr. Rāmādhāra Śarmā who can better respond to the above. I asked Dr. Śarmā if he would be interested in joining this email group and he is not.
