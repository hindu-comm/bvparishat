I can also add the following infromation about five more well known translations.

  

*Growse:*The first English translation of the Rāmacaritamānasa known to me is by Frederic Salmon Growse dating from circa 1880. For a long period of time, this was the de facto standard referred to. The book went through many reprints, two editions published at Allahabad from 1883 (second) and 1914 (sixth) are available online:

The book has been revised and reprinted by MLBD.
