I recently came to know that Prof. Philip Lutgendorf of the University of Iowa is working on an English translation of theRamacharitmanasa which will be published in seven volumes as part of the Murty Classical Library of India (MCLI) classics. The volumes will be titled *Tulsidas: The Epic of Ram*.

  

Prof. Lutgendorf has written extensively on Tulsidas' literature. His 1987 PhD thesis titled *The Life of a Text: Tulsidas' Ramcaritmanas in Performance* was published by the University of California Press in 1991 (ISBN 9780520066908). The whole work can be read online under <http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft796nb4pk&brand=ucpress>. His other notable work is *Hanuman's Tale: The Messages of a Divine Monkey* published by Oxford University Press in 2006 (ISBN 9780199885824), which is a meticulous study of Hanuman worship in India, especially northern India.
