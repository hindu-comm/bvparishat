Subject: \[INDOLOGY\] Modern scholarly translation of Tulsidas' Ramayana?  
To: "[indo...@list.indology.info]()" \<[INDO...@list.indology.info]()\>  
  
  

Dear List,  
  

I have been asked by a former student for help in finding a modern, reliable scholarly translation of Tulsidas' Ramayana into English. This is a topic that I know little about.  
  

Can some one of you help me to steer him to a good translation?  
  

Thank you in advance,  
  

George Thompson
