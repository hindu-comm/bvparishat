In an 1884 article, E T Atkinson has mentioned a similar verse. As per Atkinson, this is a ‘mantra’ used while tying *rakśā*. Atkinson offers no source or citation, and his version has the non-Pāṇinian compounded reading balirājā. The expected compounded form is balirājaḥ due to ṭac‌ by PS 5.4.91 rājā'hassakhibhyaṣṭac‌).

Reference: E T Atkinson (1884). Notes on the History of the Religion in the Himalaya of the N.W. Provinces, Part I. Volume 53, Part I (History, Antiquities, &c.). Calcutta: Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal. P. 79.
