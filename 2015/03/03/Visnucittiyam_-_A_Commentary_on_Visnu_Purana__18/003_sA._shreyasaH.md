Dear Prof. Nagaraj,

  

\>\>\>Yes, he is one of the Alwars.

\>\>\> He is the father of Andal amma avar.

  

That is not at all accurate.  

  

Are you suggesting that Sri Andal's avataram was after the time of Sri Ramanuja? :-\|  

  

Please refer texts like Divyasuri Charitram (of Sri Garuda Vahana Pandita), Guruparampara prabhavamfor hagiographical details of Srivaishnava Alwars and Acharyas.

  

The भूमिका of the listed book below briefly touches upon the significance of Sri Engal-Azhwan's contribution, post-Ramanuja (referred to as Sri Bhashyakarar).

  

Regards,

-Shreyas
