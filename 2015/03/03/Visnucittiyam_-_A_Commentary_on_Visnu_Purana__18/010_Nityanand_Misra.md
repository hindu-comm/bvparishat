Caveat lector. The link sent by Vidwan Shreyas is not a reliable source. I request scholars not to take the information for granted or draw conclusions from it. I voice my protest thus - <http://xkcd.com/285/> :)

  

I am not saying the information is wrong, it may be correct, but the link cited is not a source a journal or reputable author or publisher would rely on. Readers may refer the following links on Purdue University's Online Writing Lab website which have useful tips on evaluating sources. Especially note what the guide has to say about evaluating print versus Internet sources (the last link below).
