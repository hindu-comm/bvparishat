Hare Krishna.  
  
Dear Vidvaj-janas,  
I found the commentary named Visnucittiyam on Visnu Purana by  
Visnucitta also known as Engalvan:  
<https://archive.org/details/Vishnu_Purana_with_Vishnuchittiyam_-_PB_Annangaracharya_1972>  
  
I want to know about the identity of the commentator - from which  
sampradaya he is, is he one of the alwars, etc.  
  
Thankyou
