Vishnuchitta known as Periazvar is the one who brought up Andal amma avar.



The poetic biography of Goda Devi written in Telugu bythe scholar-king Sri Krishnadevarayalu hasthealternative name Vishnuchitteyamu apart from its well known name Aamuktamaalyada.



Vishnuchitta the commentatorof Vishnupurana is probably different from him.



Thanks Vidwan Shreyas for the clarification.
