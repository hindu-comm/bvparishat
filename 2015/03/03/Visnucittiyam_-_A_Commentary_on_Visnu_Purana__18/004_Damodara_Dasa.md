Hare Krishna.  
I also mistook, at first, Visnuchitta (the commentator of Visnu  
Purana) with Periyalvar (the father of andal) but then I learned that  
Periyalvar didn't write a commentary on Visnu-puran. So I wanted to  
know the identity of the commentator of Visnu-puran. I thank shreyas  
for this information.  
Further I seek one more information in this regard:  
Can I get the list of literatures (including commentaries) written by  
Engal-alvan?  
  
Thankyou,  
Damodara Das
