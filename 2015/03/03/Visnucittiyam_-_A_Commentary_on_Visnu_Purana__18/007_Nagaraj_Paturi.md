I downloaded the book Vishnuchitteeyam from



<https://archive.org/details/Vishnu_Purana_with_Vishnuchittiyam_-_PB_Annangaracharya_1972>



and noticed that the commentator is frequently referred to as Vishnuchittaarya unlike Periaazvaar who is known as Vishnuchitta. Adding aarya/ayya is typical of later times.



I read in the link sent by Vidwan Shreyas that EngaLaaLvan was named after PeriyaaLvaar only.
