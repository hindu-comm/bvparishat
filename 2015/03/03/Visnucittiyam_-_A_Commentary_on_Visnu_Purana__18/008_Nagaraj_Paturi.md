Can I get the list of literatures (including commentaries) written by  
Engal-alvan?  



----- The link sent by Vidwan Shreyas has the following info:



Swami Engalazhwan has written a commentary, Vishnuchitheeyam, on Vishnupurana,which is the most important of all the puranas and which is revered as a gem by Swami Aalavandaar. **This is the only work of Swami Engalazhwan which is available to us**. He has also written PrameyaSangraham, Sangathimaala and Gadya - Vyakyana.**These texts are no more available**.
