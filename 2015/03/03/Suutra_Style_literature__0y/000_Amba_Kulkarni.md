Dear members,  
  

I am curious to know if there is any other literature other than Panini's A.s.taadhyaayii and Pingala's Chandas'saastra which is also in the suutra style.  
  

I remember somewhere reading about the period in which suutra style work was more prevalent. Is it the period of Panini-Pingala's?  
  

Thanks and regards,  

Amba Kulkarni
