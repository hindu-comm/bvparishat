The entry under APHORISMS-SUTRA LITERATURE is as follows.

  

APHORISMS-SUTRA LITERATURE (Sanskrit). Aphorisms form an interesting and important part of Sanskrit literature. An aphorism is defined as a cryptic, comprehensive and unemotional statement pregnant with meaning; but it has to be often explained by referring to other aphorisms and using special rules of interpretation. Panini's Ashtadhyayi describing the Vedic and classical Sanskrit language fully in about four thousand aphorisms is a good example of Sutra literature. The various Shrautasutras, Grihyasutras, Dharmasutras and Shulbasutras belong to this type of literature. Panini refers to Bhikshusutras and Natasutras. Chandahsutras of Pingala, Arthashastra of Kautilya and Kamashastra of Vatsyayana contain sutras: so also Yaska's Nirukta. The various darshanas or systems of philosophy have their basic texts on sutras: Jaimini's Mimamsasutras, Badarayana's Brahmasutras. Kanada's Vaisheshikasutras, Gautama's Nyayasutras. Patanjali's Yogasutras. etc. The Samkhyasutras are later than the Samkhyakarika. Vamana's Kavyalamkara on poetics is in the form of sutra and vritti. The sutra type of literature was very popular for a long time; later this gave way to metrical karikas. which was found easier for memorizing: but the sutra literature has its own place. In the Mimansasutras, the arrangement of the subject is in the forms of Adhikaranas—each consisting of five sections in a specific order: vishaya (topic), samshaya (doubt), purvapaksha (prima facie view), siddhanta (conclusion) and sangati (correlation).
