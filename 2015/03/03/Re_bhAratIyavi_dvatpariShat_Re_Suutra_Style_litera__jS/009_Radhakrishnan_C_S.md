Dear Dr.Amba Kulkarni,

So far as the Alankara sastra is concerned, The Rasasutra of Bharata is not only famous but also significant. For, even though he wrote the entire Natyasastra in verses, the most important concept of Rasa is exposed by him in the form of Sutra. After him, it was Vamana who preferred the Sutra style, instead of verses.

  

With regards,

  

Radhakrishnan
