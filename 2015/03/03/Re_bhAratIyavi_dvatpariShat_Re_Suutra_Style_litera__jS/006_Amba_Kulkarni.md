Thank you Prof. Deshpande. The article is very informative, and clearly mentions two different styles of suutra style.  
  

I have another question, these Suutra works are probably so named because the suutras in them hang together like a thread.  
  

My question is when does the '[lak.sa.na](http://lak.sa.na)' for suutra viz  

alpaak.saram asandigdham saaravat vi'svato mukham, etc was given.  
  

I read somewhere that it is found in Vayu [puraa.na](http://puraa.na)  
  

With kind regards,  

Amba
