Dear Amba,

  

  I have attached the pdf of an encyclopedia article by Johannes Bronkhorst on the meaning and use of the title "Sūtra". Keep in mind that the sūtra style of Pāṇini is very different from the style of texts carrying the same title in Jainism and Buddhism. There is a suggestion made, I think by Professor Richard Gombrich, that the Pali word sutta, rendered conventionally into Sanskrit as sūtra, may have actually come from Sanskrit sūkta, rather than sūtra. That is something worth considering. In any case, you should find Bronkhorst's article informative. Best,
