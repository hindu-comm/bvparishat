Also, buddhists have many treatises as sutras. Sutras are in Pali also



----The following is from



<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sutra>



Some scholars consider that the Buddhist use of *sutra* is a mis-Sanskritization of Prakrit or Pali *sutta*, and that the latter represented Sanskrit *sūkta*, "well spoken", "good news" (as the Buddha himself refers to his speech in his first sermon; compare the original meaning of *Gospel*), which would also resolve as *sutta* in Pali. The early Buddhist sutras do not present the aphoristic, nearly cryptic nature of the Hindu sutras, even though they also have been designed for mnemonic purposes in an oral tradition. On the contrary, they are most often lengthy, with many repetitions which serve the mnemonic purpose of the audience. They share the character of sermons of "good news" with the Jaina sutras, whose original name of *sūya* (in Ardhamagadhi language) can derive from Sanskrit *sūkta*, but hardly from *sutra*.
