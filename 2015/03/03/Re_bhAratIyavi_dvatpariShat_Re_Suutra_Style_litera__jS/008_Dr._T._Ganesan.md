In the Saiva tradition the Saiva Agama verses, which are mostly in the anuShTubh meter, are generally called SUtra; we have RauravasUtrasaMgraha, SvAyambhuvasUtrasaMgraha, etc. The well known Saivasiddhanta text SivajnAnabodha consisting 12 anuShTubh verses is popularly known as SivajnAnabodhasUtra.
