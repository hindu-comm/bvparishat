This search link throws up extract from a Wikipedia article which refers page 71 in the book Hinduism (ISBN 9781845574253, 2005) by Maharaja Dr. Karan Singh to state the quote's Rgvedic origin. While the Maharaja is known for his love and support for Sanskrit, on the specific page referred he simply says "the Rgvedic dictum" (and not verse) without giving any citation (recension, verse number or publication). Even though the author is reliable, this specific reference is not as it is missing a citation.

No citation here too. In addition, there is no information regarding author or editor of the content on this \[hagiographic\] page.

Again, no citation, and no information about author or editor.

No citation again, and the author is hardly known in the field of Sanskrit or Vedic scholarship.

This is a blogspot URL! The blogger/quizmaster, not suprisingly, does not cite the answer to any question.

I hope Dr. Bhat is joking. None of these sources is reliable - they all seem to propagate an urban legend.
