The linecould have been an own composition by Swami Vivekananda. But the idea contained init is not. It is typical of Swamiji that most of his aphorismic expressionsdo not deviate fromfrom the age old 'Hindu' tradition. Nevertheless he gives a new,contemporarytwist in the interpretation of those expressions/principles.



The present line under discussion "आत्मनो मोक्षार्थं जगद्हिताय च" is a case in point.



Almost all devotional/spiritual writers in their works claim that the objective of their writing is आत्मनो मोक्षार्थं only. But almost all of them are being viewed as working जगद्हिताय च. We can not say that these authors were unmindful of the जगद्हिताय च aspect.



Another way this principle is discussed is in the context of tapas of the sages. All the tapas activities of the sages are considered by the respective sages as आत्मनो मोक्षार्थं only. But the Hindu society always considered those activities as जगद्हिताय च.



In both these cases आत्मनो मोक्षार्थं is the perspective of the saint and the sage. जगद्हिताय च is the view of the society.



The contemporary twist Swamiji gives to this principle is that he inspires the monks of the Ramakrishna order to consciously keep both आत्मनो मोक्षार्थं and जगद्हिताय च as their objectives.



The जगद्हिताय च of the devotional /spiritual literary worksis to be useful to each of the readers मोक्षार्थं.



In the case of sages the जगद्हिताय च is in the form of mahimaa, the supernatural benefit to the surrounding environment and people living in it.



Swamiji's जगद्हिताय च is in the form of conscious worldly, missionary, socialservice activities.
