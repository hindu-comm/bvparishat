Hari Om,  
  

Namaste.  

  
....Off at once, to lay down your life for your own liberation and for the good of others. What good is it carrying along a load of bones and flesh! Initiated into the Mantra of extreme self - sacrifice for the sake of God, go, lay down for others this body of flesh and bones like the Muni Dadhichi! .... C.W of Swami Vivekananda Volume 6 page 473.  
  
  
Following passage relates to same idea-  
  
Another truth I have realised is that altruistic service only is religion, the rest, such as ceremonial observances, are madness -- even it is wrong to hanker after one's own salvation. Liberation is only for him who gives up everything for others, whereas others who tax their brains day and night harping on "my salvation", "my salvation", wander about with their true well - being ruined, both present and prospective; and this I have seen many a time with my own eyes. C.W of Swami Vivekananda Volume Volume 6 page 395.  
  
Addressing then his brothers of the Order, he said: Our life is "\[(Sanskrit)\]-- for the sake of our self - liberation as well as for the good of the world". So what are you sitting idle for? Arise, awake; wake up yourselves, and awaken others. Achieve the consummation of human life before you pass off --"Arise, awake, and stop not till the goal is reached." C.W of S.V volume 6 page 512.  
  
  

To quote a few.
