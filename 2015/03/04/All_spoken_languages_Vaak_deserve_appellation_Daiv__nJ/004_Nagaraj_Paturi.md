Question of primacy of a language is different from the issue of a certain culture being encapsulated in a certain language.



It is also different from theidea ofa certain language being 'gardened' more carefully and zealously than the other.



Without any claim of primacy it can safely be accepted that speakers of no other language than Sanskritfocussed on the idea of language and its ability to encapsulate their culture and so passionately pursued the preservation of the early features of the language with the intention of preserving the culture and spirit it embodies.
