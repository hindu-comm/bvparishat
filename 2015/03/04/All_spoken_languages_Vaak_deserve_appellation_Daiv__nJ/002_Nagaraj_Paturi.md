1\. Who said that the appellation Daivee Vaak for Sanskrit is based on the four stages of speech production?



2\. A distinction needs to be made between 'Language'/'Speech' as a phenomenon and languages in plural. Most of the analyses such as stages of speech production in books such as Vaakypadeeyam apply to 'Language'/'Speech' in general.
