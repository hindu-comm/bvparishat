Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



There is a single Sphoṭa śabda and the same is Vyākŗtā by different sages differently. Four types of Vāk are recognized by Vaiyākaraņas. It is said reflections of the single Sphota śabda appear in all Sanskrit śabdas with meanings. Many spoken languages (Vāk) go through the same four stages as Sanskrit before reaching Vaikharī. The same single sphota (at the highest level of Vāk) must be reflecting through words of languages like English, Arabic etc. Due to the single Sphota shabda’s presence in all Vak, other languages too deserve appellation Daivī Vāk in the way Sanskrit is addressed by Vaiyākaraņas. Please comment. Thanks. N.R.Joshi
