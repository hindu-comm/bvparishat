Exactly. Only in Sanskrit, it is called दैवी वाक् as संस्कृतं नाम दैवी वाग् अन्वाख्याता महर्षिभिः as by Dandin, and whether others are called दैवी वाक् please do research. It may be found God Created the language and the later grammarians also agreed. One has to do a throrough search.

  

By all means, this division by the stages of speech (and not at any stage) it is mentioned it applies to संस्कृत only, than that it is described in संस्कृत language:

  

परा वाङ्मूलचक्रस्था पश्यन्ती नाभिसंस्थिता ।

हृदिस्था मध्यमा ज्ञेया वैखरी कण्ठदेशगा ॥

  

The above is the division. further explained in Vakyapadiya. Check in this and other similar threads for explanation differently. पाणिनीयशिक्षा also refers to the process of speech as applicable to any language, in the first three stages and vary only differ in the वैखरी stage according to the phonetic description of the alphabets of the respective language.

  

Here is my comment:
