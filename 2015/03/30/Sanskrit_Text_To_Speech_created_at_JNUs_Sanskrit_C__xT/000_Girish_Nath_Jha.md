The first functional Sanskrit TTS has been created as part of a Ph.D. (Diwakar Mishra) at our center. The system is live at<http://sanskrit.jnu.ac.in/samvacaka/index.jsp>. Please test it with simple Sanskrit prose. No prosody delivered yet  

  

Your valuable feedback will help improve the system

  

Thanks
