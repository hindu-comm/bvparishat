Sir, Namaste

Thank you for the TTS. The machine works very well.

I have tried this sentence.

एकदा कोऽपि मयूरः बकं दृष्ट्वा आत्मनः कलापभारं उद्यम्य तं बकं क्षुद्रवत् मत्वा जातरूपकल्पानां स्वस्य पिच्छानां शोभां तस्मै दर्शयति स्म।  

  

One suggestion-

Can the speed of sound, be reduced a little? Its running faster than usual.

And make the machine to take a little more pause at spaces between words?

Only, at one place- while sayingदर्शयति there is a little disturbance, like unwanted sound. That's all- Rest is all perfect.

Thanks again-
