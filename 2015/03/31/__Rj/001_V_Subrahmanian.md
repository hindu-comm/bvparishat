Namaste  
  

The seventh prapāṭhaka of the Taittiriya āraṇyaka constitutes the Taittiriya Upaniṣad and there is a very detailed commentary for it by Shankaracharya, a gloss on it by Anandagiri and another one by name 'Vanamālā'. And a vārtika by Sri Sureśvarācārya. There is also a detailed independent commentary in Sanskrit by Sri Vidyaraṇya to this portion.  
  
All these texts mentioned above are taken up in *the English translation* by Sri Allāḍi Mahādeva Śāstri under the title 'The Taittiriya Upaniṣad' and published as a big volume by Samata Books.
