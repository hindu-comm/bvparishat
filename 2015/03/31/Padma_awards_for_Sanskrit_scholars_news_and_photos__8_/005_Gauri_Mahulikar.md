I was fortunate to hear Swami Ramabhadracharya recently at Chitrakoot.

I also visited the unique University for Differently abled people established by him, and was happy to meet some deaf and dumb artistswho were engaged in drawing and painting master pieces.

Swamiji, is Prajnacaksu and spoke for 30 minutes giving various etymologies of the word Itihasa
