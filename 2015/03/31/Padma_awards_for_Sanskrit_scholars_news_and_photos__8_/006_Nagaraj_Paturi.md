We all speak of the Vedic /Sanskrit tradition being purely oral, persons achieving great heights of Vedic /Sankrit scholarship through pure oral learning. But since individuals withvisual ability can readand/or write, there is a scope for at least a suspicion of oral and literate methods of learning. To demonstrate to the world, thegreatness of pure oral learning, an example of a person who is visually differently abled being in the Vedic/Sanskritadhyayana-adhyaapana traditionand achieving miraculous heights was required. Parama Poojya Jagadguru Pandita Ramabhadracharyajiis a kaaraNajanma born for the purpose of demonstrating such a great power of pure oral tradition of Vedic/ Sanskrit learning.



Scholars/researchers interested in studying the issue of the oral tradition of adhyayana-adhyaapana in Vedic/Sanskrit tradition can take up studying this miracle-personality.
