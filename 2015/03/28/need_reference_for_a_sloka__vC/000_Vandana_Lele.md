Namskar,

  

I need a reference of a sloka.

  

तिलोद्वर्ती तिलस्नायी शुचिर्नित्यं तिलोदकी \|

होता दाता च भोक्ता च षट्तिली नावसीदति \|\|

  

I have incomplete information about this sloka. It says that शातातप- the Smrutikaara has described the importance of sesame seeds through this sloka. I searched in the book edited by ' Dharmasastrasamgraha" , by Shree Jivanand Vidyasagar Bhattacharya , published by him from Calcutta. Similarly I also referred the book published by Anandashram Samstha - Pune . But Did not find the book and the sloka number.

  

I request to help me to get the necessary reference.

  

  

Thank you,

  

Vandana Lele
