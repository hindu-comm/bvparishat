In the book we used in our MA from VMOU, there are two chapters on gItikAvyas.  

But there is no definition about them. There definitely is some roundabout information about the qualities of gItikAvyas.  

There is list of authors and their compositions also.  

If this interests you, I can share them with you after I get it scanned on monday.
