The wordगीति in Sanskrit means A Song. 

As found in the examples like:

"अहो रागपरिवाहिणी गीति:"

"श्रुताप्सरॊगीतिरिव क्षणे,अस्मिऩ् हर: प्रसङ्ख्यानपरो बभूव। "

  

So any Kavya is meant for singing having been composed in different RAGAS and TALAS can be aगीतिकाव्यम्\| The most popularगीतिकाव्यम् isगीतगोविन्दम् of Jayadeva। In the Gitagovinda Jayadeva distributed his entire content into 24 Ashtapadis + 73 intervening Shlokas to depict the divine union of Radha Devi and Sri Krishna in a very tender and lucid expressions.

Following the this Prototype गीतिकाव्यम् of Jayadeva 139 more Gitikavyam were produced by later poets during 17th and 18th Centuries.
