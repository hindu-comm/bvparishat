many many thanks to all the scholars for the quick response.I was wondering whether Geetikaavya is a type oftraditional Sanskrit poetry and if yes, how old, which is the oldest example and whether it is defined by any kaavyashaastrakaara. We do come across a few geetikaavyas by modern Sanskrit poets but I do not know if any abhijaata poet has composed one.

Thanks once again
