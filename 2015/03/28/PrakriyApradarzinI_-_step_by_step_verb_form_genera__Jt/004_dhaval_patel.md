Thank you very much for your feedback sir.  

I have noted it down in issues in Github at <https://github.com/drdhaval2785/SanskritVerb/issues/134> for tackling.  

Currently the machine handles only kartari forms.  

karmaNi and bhAva are pending to code.  

I will get back to them soon.  
  

But it seems that I will have to remove the radio buttons for karma and bhAva from the frontend till I code for them, so that the users are not drawn asunder.
