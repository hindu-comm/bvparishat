Sri Nanasaheb,  
  
These words "praakrita dhvani" and "vaikrita dhvani" is mentioned in Dr. Kunjunni Raja's book "Indian Theories of Meaning" in the first chapter (Introduction - Meaning of Meaning) almost at the end of the chapter - page No. 14,15. He had compared the "praachina vaiyakarana" and "naveena vaiyakarana" methods of the classification of "Varna" and later Dr. Kunjunni Raja explains the "sphota" of Sri. Bhartrihari.
