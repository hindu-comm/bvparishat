How do you want it to be enforced moderate every mail that comes in? Most members who request for membership say they are affiliated to an academic institute of Sanskrit learning. Google Group does not provide an option to edit mails.  
Scholars know too well most Indians cannot write four error free English sentences that is a fact one has to live with. Original research in Sanskrit is fast dwindling to zero. Many will not know titles of or would have not read or heard of standard books on the subjects they send their questions  
Suggestions as private mails to the group owner or to me are welcome.
