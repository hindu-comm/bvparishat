Khan, Mohammad Israil. 1978. *Sarasvat^ in Sanskrit Literature.* Ghaziabad: Crescent Publication House.

Ludvik, Catherine. 2007. *Sarasvat^: Riverine Goddess of Knowledge.* Brill: Leiden-Boston.

The introductory part of Baa.na’s Har.sa-carita has a story about Sarasvatii.

If you are primarily interested in Sarasvatii as a river, you will get almost all relevant references from my 2014 article “Sarasvati drowned:Rescuing Her from Scholarly Whirlpools,” published in \_Sindhu-Sarasvatī Civilization: New Perspectives (a Volume in Memory of Dr. ShikaripurRanganatha Rao)\_, pp. 91-187. New Delhi: D.K. Printworld.

  

On the other discussion lists or forums of which I am a member, such queries almost always include a list of the titles of which the inquirer is aware or an indication of where he/she has already looked. When other members help in compiling a useful bibliography, the inquirer posts a complete and \*systematically ordered\* version of that bibliography in his/her last posting on the topic. Why should the same thing not happen on the BVP forum?
