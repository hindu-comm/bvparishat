The fourth chapter of matsyapurana has a story. It is here that that a very important message that such Puranic stories belong to a different plane of reality and 'ethicality' in such stories can not be adjudged on the basis of just the apparent.



Matsyanarayana cautions and instructs all:



दिव्येयमादिसृष्टिस्तु रजोगुणसमुद्भवा

अतीन्द्रियेन्द्रिया तद्वदतीन्द्रियशरीरिका 4-3



दिव्यतेजोमयी भूप दिव्यज्ञानसमुद्भवा

न मर्त्यैरभितः शक्त्या वक्तुं वै मांसचक्षुभिः 4-4
