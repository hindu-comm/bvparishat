Strongly agree withProf. Aklujkar. While there is a set of rules and guidelines for this forum (which can be expanded), but sadly they are neither adhered to nor strictly enforced. The quality of most discussions is not up the academic standards expected in such a group. Often mebers post anything from any source - random blogs, Google search snapshots, quotes from unreliable publications, quotes qualified as "a reputable scholar \[who I will not name\] once said this \[when I will not tell\]", etc. On some threads the original inquirers never bother to post again, let alone thanking the answers or compiling the bibliography. Complete citations are rarity.

  

Request the owners and moderators to do something in this regard, else the likes of Prof. Aklujkar may one day just leave the group.
