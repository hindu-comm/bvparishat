And also add where in the नाठ्यशास्त्र, you found the usage of उद्भाण्ड and the reference to Chapter and verse. So that it can be easily looked into the Abhinavabharati's commentary easily. Otherwise one cannot browse through the 32 chapters of Natyashastra for this word.

  

There is onebhāṇḍavādya and also some varieties of this musical Instrument. Could not locate udbhāṇḍa in the chapters I looked into.
