Dear Prof. Misra,



Is there any thesis like "India in Valmiki's description" like we have  
Agarwal's thesis on Panini?



The topicssuch as"India in Panini's time" , "India in Patanjali's time"are different from "India in Valmiki's description".



"India in Valmiki's description" has been a topic of a big controversy. People placed the places described in Ramayana at different parts of the Indic region. That is a Pandora's box.



In stead it may be worthwhile to discuss Puranic sources for the maahaatmya different parts of Dandakaranya. Narmadamaahaatmya
(Matsyapurana etc. Reva khnda etc.) Godavareemaahaatmya etc. might be of help.



Regards,



Nagaraj
