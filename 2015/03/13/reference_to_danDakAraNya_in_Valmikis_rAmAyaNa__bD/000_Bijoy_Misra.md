Dear friends and scholars,  

In my Ramayana expedition I am just starting the AraNyakANDa to prepare  

for a session Sunday. A question comes in mind and I thought some of you  

may have a reference. The question is why is daNDakAraNya populated with  

the sages which it is a dense forest inhabited by fearsome animals and  

cannibals. In the earlier sections. VishvAmitra had also come down to the  

south to do his yajna. Please refer me to any commentary that might have  

analyzed the question.  

Best regards,  

Bijoy Misra
