Friend scholars,  

I should have made a point clear. Reconstruction of imagery from the text  

is independent of mapping it in the current landscape. Reconstruction should  

be considered a literary research work to check if we understand the words  

as applied in the text. We understand a word or a sentence through its  
accepted meaning during the current times. Reconstruction would depend  

upon interpretation and fresh research. So I said "India in Valmiki's  

Description" to create an imagery as Valmiki wrote. This image can then  
evolve in to the current landscape in another piece of work developed through  
local legends, stories and later literary works. I understand that the current  
chief of Indian Historical Society in interested in digging old works. So possibly  
new work can be supported.  

Best regards,  

Bijoy Misra
