While I have been observing this thread on the reference to DANDAKARANYA in VALMIKI RAMAYANA, the thoughts of some scholars have given me encouragement to share a few ideas from my sources. Particularly make an attempt here to present the gist of a few pages in ENGLISH from a TELUGU book "RAMAYANA - MAHABHARATAMULU KALPITAMULA? (WERE THE RAMAYANA AND MAHABHARATA WERE MYTHICAL?) written by LATE RANI SRINIVASA SASTRI (my father) where he dealt in detail with the path of RAMA from AYODHYA to LANKA identifying with longitudes and latitudes of modern geographical terms. I hope this may be worthy to be presented here in this context.

In the main body of the attachment the mangal fonts could not be accommodated. So I am giving the reference sloka to the LANKA from Siddhanta Siromani here:

लङ्का कुमध्ये यमकोटिरस्या: प्राक़् पश्चिमे रोमकपट्टणं च।

अधस्तथा सिद्धपुरं सुमेरु: सौम्येथ याम्ये बडाबानलश्च॥

                           - सिद्धान्तशिरोमणौ भुवनकोशाध्याय:

Scholars are request to see the rest of the article in the attachment of this mail.

Warm Regards,



**Dr. Rani Sadasiva Murty**
