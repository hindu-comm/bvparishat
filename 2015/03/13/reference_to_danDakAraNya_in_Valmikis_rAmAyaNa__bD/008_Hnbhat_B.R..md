I think Sunil Bhattacharya has replied for your doubt. It is not a patch of forest. The reverse is the case. The village settlements are made far away from the wild beasts and students approach the nearest hermitage to their village. But there is no need to return back to their villages once they enter the schools than after finishing their studies. So also the custom for ब्रह्मचारिन्-s inmates of the sages and वानप्रस्थ-s, and यति-s, not to return back to the village settlements once they enter the hermit life. This is attested by the different धर्मसूत्र-s. Here is the extract from गौतमधर्मसूत्र ---

  

*१,३.२५ । ३.२६: वैखानसो वने मूलफलाशी तपःशीलः ।*

१,३.२६ । ३.२७: श्रावणकेनाग्निमाधाय ।  

{वर्\_स्त्: श्रामणकेन}

१,३.२७ । ३.२८: अग्राम्यभोजी ।  

१,३.२८ । ३.२९: देवपितृमनुष्यभूतर्षिपूजकः ।  

१,३.२९ । ३.३०: सर्वातिथिः प्रतिषिद्धवर्जम् ।  

१,३.३० । ३.३१: वैष्कमप्युपयुञ्जीत ।  

{वर्\_स्त्: बैष्कम्}

*१,३.३१ । ३.३२: न फालकृष्टमधितिष्ठेत् ।  
*

*१,३.३२ । ३.३३: ग्रामं च न प्रविशेत् ।  
*

  

This is the reason why hermits establish their hermitages away from the villages so that the villagers do no disturb their life and they need not go to the villages. This is according to other authors of Dharmasutra-s.

OK. Please proceed with the clude you have got.

  

I too do not get why अरण्य is located away from the villages.
