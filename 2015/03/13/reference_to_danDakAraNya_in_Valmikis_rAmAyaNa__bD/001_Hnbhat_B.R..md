Here is the answer from Puranic Encyclopedia:

  

3\) The origin of Daṇḍakāranya (the forest of Daṇḍaka).

Daṇḍa once raped Arā, the daughter of hermit Śukra,

who had been doing penance in a forest in the middle

of the country of Daṇḍa. Śukra the hermit got angry and

destroyed the country of Daṇḍa by a shower of fire.

From that day onwards that country was known as

Daṇḍakāraṇya. (For further information see under

Arā).

  

The reference to the King, Daṇḍa is given in Mahabharata. The Episode is said to be in Uttararamayana or Uttarakanda. He has not given ay more reference. The Uttarakanda is available in internet [archive.org](http://archive.org) in English Translation and could be checked.
