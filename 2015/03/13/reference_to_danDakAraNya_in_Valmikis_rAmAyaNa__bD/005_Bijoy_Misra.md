Dear Dr Subrahmanian,  

Valmiki does use the word वानप्रस्थाः.  

What i don't get is why the अरण्य should be removed far away (hundreds of miles) from the habitations.  

This दण्डक has eminent sages and they are complaining of violence by the राक्षस  

Possibly other अरण्य existed without राक्षस.  

There are no women in दण्डक, hence Sita becomes a target for विराध right when they enter.  

It may unravel as I progress.  

BM  

  
PS.

  
\[Here you get a clue to the 'Yoga schools on the banks of the Narmada\]  

I read somewhere that Shankara met GovindapAda somewhere near Narmada.
