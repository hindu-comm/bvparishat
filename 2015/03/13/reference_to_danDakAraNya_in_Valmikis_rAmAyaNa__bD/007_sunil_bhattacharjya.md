weNamaste,  
  

When the Mahayogai Yajnavalkya departed from his wife, in order to live the life of a Sanyashi, he told his wife that he only needed to have a place where phalakandodaka (fruits, roots and water) were available. Even the grhastha rishis, who had their ashramas in the forests, also needed these as bare minimum, though they were having cows also in their ashramas.  
  

As regards Dandakaranya, it was no small patch of forest. After leaving Chitrakut Lord Ram went to Nasik in Dandakaranya and finally Mother Sita was kidnapped from near Bhadravati in Dandakaranya (distance from Nasik to Bhadravati is about 900 KM). Such a big forest did not necessarily have a homogeneous flora, fauna and human habitation.  
  

Regards,
