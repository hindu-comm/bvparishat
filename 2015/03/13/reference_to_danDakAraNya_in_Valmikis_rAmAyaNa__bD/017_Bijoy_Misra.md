Dear Prof Iyengar,  
  

My exposure to the field is weak. Thank you for the references I will check.  

The goal I have in mind is to explore areas where our young people abroad  

can be motivated to contribute. I was checking if anyone has created a  

map comprising of distances and landmarks that Valmiki describes.  

Further work on extension, morphing, satellite imaging can be done in  

case we can create a physical geographic map according to Valmiki.  

  

I see the doability of such a project and I am checking if anyone  

has done it. It would look like an early cartographic map which could  

be imaginary as all old maps are. The analysis and extension may  

give information on climate change, river movement, forestry and  

habitation.  
  

So was the thought. I appreciate your guidance.   
  

Best regards,  

Bijoy Misra
