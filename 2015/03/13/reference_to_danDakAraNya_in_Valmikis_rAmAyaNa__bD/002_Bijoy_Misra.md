Dear Dr Bhat,  

This is interesting. I am more interested if there is any observation why  

the sages would choose to live in the interior India. It looks to me it might  
not be pure fancy. I have heard that Narnada valley was populated with yoga  

schools from the old times. In case some literature person has explored  

anthropology and archaeology, he/she might have a clue.  

Thank you for the post.  

BM
