OK. The actual reference why Dandaka became Aranya, I have given. And sages normally live in Aranya-s like any Aranhya-s are described in literature. For me your observation seems fanciful.

  

The exact reference I found in some other reference book on Puana-s, Uttarakanda 79-81. Anyhow, I am not familiar with anthropology and archaeology as it is not my domain.

  

You can read the story in Uttarakanda for exact information what happened to the kingdom of Dandaka and not anthropological and archaelogical information.
