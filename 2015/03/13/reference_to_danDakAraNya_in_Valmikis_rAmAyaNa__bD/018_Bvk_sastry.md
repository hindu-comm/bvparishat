Namaste  
  
I agree with Dr. RNI on the point: "If VR were not to be there, north and south of India would not have remained emotionally and culturally united."  
  
Looking at another perspective of ' why yogis in Southern India/ forests'  
At such early period (- whatever historicity one wants to associate), can a look be taken from the planks of Buddhism and Jainism, who are also yoga- practitioners of early period? Both these traditions preferentially adapted Ramayana than Mahabharata. The pointer is to see the Dandaka-Aranya in south as a complement or counter part of Naimisharanya in north?  
The saptasindhus no doubt are on north side of india; but seven sacred rivers remembered in india includes two prominent south indian rivers Godavari and Kaveri. As always river basins have always been the preferred places of yogis just as southern mountains and forests have been.  
  
A thought shared in response to Dr. Mishras post.
