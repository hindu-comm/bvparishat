Friends,  

I am grateful to you all for many excellent resources.  

Let me check these. The question could come if the reconstruction  
is done through the current names or through distance traveled  
as described. Historicity of the locations and change in physical  
features through time are other concerns. Possibly from a cartographic  
map one can construct a physical geography map given the description  

and then compare it with the current features to check river shifts, climate  

variations, human habitation etc. Let us see.  

Thank you for supporting my novice probes.  

Best regards,  

BM
