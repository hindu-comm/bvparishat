Here is a page listing (but not analyzing and comparing with modern India) place names in Ramayana, and character names:

  

<http://hinduism.about.com/library/weekly/extra/bl-ramayana-characters.htm>  

  

I think I have seen a similar book indexing the names trees and plants in Ramayana.

  

Here is an video showing the kingdom of Rama as it claims:

This is also a similar listing in Viki

  

<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Places_in_the_Ramayana>  

  

Geographically identifying the places is a different thing, than writing on the Life of India, at the time of Valmiki in India, is different one. The India at the time of Valmiki is such topic, both geographically identifying and assuming the life of people in India from their descriptions is another topic of research. Archeaologists should combine their hands with the Sanskrit Scholars, to write such a book, if it is meant by Bijoy Mishra and a knower of the literary style of Valmiki, like Bijoy Mishra himself and one more Indian Historian to interpret the archaeological evidences.

  

If not already existing, one could endeavor on such an attempt which may take a long time for such a project.
