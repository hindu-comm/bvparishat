Probably there were राक्षसाः and sages only in addition to wild animals and no other settlement of civilised human beings even as villages. The hermitage too spare and not throughout दण्डक and only a bird जटायु had to fight रावण and sages or their wives couldn't fight against the demons as they are man eaters. Hope you will find the solution to your doubts later.
