The obvious reason for resorting to the forest is: One desirous of tapas has to be away from worldly vyavahara and being in the city/village is not conducive for tapas. Also, in the forest, the tapasvin's food requirement is taken care of as he can feed on roots, fruits, etc. naturally available there. One can give an extended reason to the wild-animals question: in the Yoga shāstra there is a sutra: ahimsāpratiṣṭhāyām tatsannidhau vairatyāgaḥ. So, a true tapasvin established in the mahāvrata called ahimsā, will not be harmed by animals for even they give up their enmity/fierce nature towards him in his abode. In any case, the living in a forest is tough and that is why it is voluntarily sought by tapasvins and as a punishment to Kings like Rama and the Pandavas when they were banished to the forest where the usual luxuries/comforts are not available.   
  
There are many references to connect sages to the araṇya (forest):  
  
1. सेयं षडध्यायी अरण्येऽनूच्यमानत्वादारण्यकम्  
  

\[This is taken from the introduction to the Brihadāraṇyakopaniṣad commentary of Shankaracharya: This upanishad with six chapters is so named (second part of the name) because it is taught-repeated in the forest.\]  
  
2. ये च अमी अरण्ये वानप्रस्थाः परिव्राजकाश्चारण्यनित्याः, अनेवंविदामपि गृहस्थानां यज्ञादिसाधनोपपत्तेः, भिक्षुवानप्रस्थयोश्च अरण्यसम्बन्धेन ग्रहणात्, \[from the Br.up.bhashya\]  
  
3. ये च इमे अरण्ये वानप्रस्थाः परिव्राजकाश्च  
  
4.श्रीमद्भगवद्गीताभाष्यम्।अष्टादशोऽध्यायः।श्लोक५२-भाष्यम्विविक्तसेवी अरण्य*नदीपुलिन*गिरिगुहादीन् विविक्तान् देशान् सेवितुं शीलम् अस्य इति विविक्तसेवी,  

\[Here you get a clue to the 'Yoga schools on the banks of the Narmada\]  
  

ते य एवमेतद्विदुर्ये चामी *अरण्ये* श्रद्धां सत्यमुपासते Br.up.6.2.15  
  

There is a passage cited in the bhashyam: ‘अरण्यमियादिति पदं ततो न पुनरेयादित्युपनिषत्’\[One aught to go to the forest and not return from there. That is, from that vānaprastha āśrama one should not return to householder's life.\]
