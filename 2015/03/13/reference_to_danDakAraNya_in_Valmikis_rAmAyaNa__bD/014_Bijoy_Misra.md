Dear Prof. Nagaraj,  

I had seen a Tamil thesis on the botany of Ramayana in an interview process  

two decades ago. It was from the University of Madars. A similar study on the  

geography, sociology and anthropology could be worthwhile. It could be pure  

objective research reconstructed from the text with any associated documentary  

support. Possibly several students could be engaged to research various  

aspects to have better focus. We have to create a collaboration on behalf of  

our new youth in order to support knowledge and techniques of multi-disciplinary  

research. Please think. We will find funding.  

Best regards,  

Bijoy Misra
