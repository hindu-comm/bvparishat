Just a small literary reference that very broadly, but directly, handles the question as to why ascetics resort to forests.

  

(There could, of course, be many others, some even more valid than the one here. The reference has the value at least of antiquity (4th century BC ?))  

  

Says dramatist bhAsa in his celebrated play*svapna*-*vAsavadatta* 1.5:

  

*nagara-paribhavAn vimoktum ete*

*vanam abhigamya manasvino vasanti.*

  

"Men of resolution as they are, they choose to go dwell in the forest, in order to obviate the humiliations \[normally countenanced\] in the cities."

  

(Just a curio note : This verse was uttered by BVKSastry (whose response
precedes this) donning the role of kAn"cukIya (and I was
yaugandharAyaNa - way back in 1974 when we enacted the immortal play of bhAsa in full. Sorry for the extraneous matter!)
