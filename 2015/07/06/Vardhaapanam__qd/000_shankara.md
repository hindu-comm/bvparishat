Pranams to all,

  

The word 'vardhaapanam' was used in the sense of 'congratulations/greetings' to by some learned members of this forum in a recent post. When I checked MW Dictionary and other lexicons, the meaning of vardhaapanam is given as follows.

### vardhaapana

वर्धापन n. (for 2. See. col. 2) the act of cutting the umbilical cord , (or) the ceremony in commemoration of that act Vet. Pur. (MW dictionary)  
  

### varddhaapana

वर्द्धापन {@वर्द्धापन@}¦ न० वर्द्धं छेदं करोति वर्द्ध + णिच्--आप् च ततोमावे ल्युट् . नाडीच्छेदमलर्माङ्गे संस्कारभेदे ति० त०रघु० . (Vaachaspatyam)  
  
It is only Apte who gives a different definition, in addition to the above.  

**

### varddhaapanam

वर्धापनम्. Any festival in general when wishes for prosperity and other congratulatory expressions are offered; cf. पूर्णपात्र. (Apre's dictionary)  
  
I request scholars to comment on the validity of using 'vardhaapana' to mean greetings/congratulations.

shankara
