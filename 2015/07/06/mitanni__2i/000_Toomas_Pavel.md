Mitragan,  
  
It has been suggested that Mitanni language has loan words from Middle Indo-Aryan. Mitanni word satta (Skt sapta) is given an example for this. What causes scholars to reject this evidence?  
  
Another suggestion is that Mitanni aikavartana is not pre vedic. Does evidence exist for the argument that vedic /e/ had ceased to be a diphthong when Rigveda was created?
