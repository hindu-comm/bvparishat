Sorry to intervene as I have no idea of the current discussion. But my interest is in the highlighted portion of the post. That means, you have rejected śabda (verbal testimony) as a pramāṇa, and subsequetnly Rgveda becomes 'pauruṣeya' (authored), as it was 'created'? However, the discussion on 'apauruṣeyatva' of Veda is not uncommon amongst the Indian philosophical schools.
