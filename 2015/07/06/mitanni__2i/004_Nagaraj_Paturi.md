Dear Dr Pavel,



This is in response to your post in the other thread.



I thought it is appropriate to bring the discussion here.



I do not know if you noticed my response to the Mitanni related post
titled as "

Fun media piece about the Mitanni: Sanskrit in Ancient Syria"

on the Indology list.

It started with Prof. Dominik Wujastyk sharing the link

<http://scroll.in/article/737715/fact-check-india-wasnt-the-first-place-sanskrit-was-recorded-it-was-Syria>

Throughout this piece the word Mitanni is used as the name of a dynasty not of a language. Title of the thread also has "***the*** Mitanni" making 'Mitanni' a group of people rather than a language. The article says, "The Mitannis spoke a language called Hurrian, unrelated to Sanskrit". It is also said in the article that before switching completely to Hurrian, people who founded the Mitanni dynasty, spoke Rigvedic Sanskrit. Do you mean by Mitanni language what the article calls the Rigvedic Sanskrit spoken by the founders of the Mitanni dynasty before replacing it with Hurrian? This article does not have any claim that the Rigvedic Sanskrit spoken by the founders of the Mitanni dynasty was pre-Vedic.

However, the title of the thread itself calls the article "fun media piece"

I responded satirically to this article, brought out many self-contradicting statements in it and finally posted as follows:

Where was the context to say anything about 'Mitanni language (?)' or its being pre-Vedic or not here? 



Warm regards,
