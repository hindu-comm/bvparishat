Namaste,  
  

May I suggest another historical perspective on this issue. The Mittanis were the contemporaries of the Mauryas and that was around the 15th century BCE. At that time Buddhism spread towards the west of India.
Alberuni also seems to vouch for it in his account by saying that Buddhism was thriving in Iran before Zarathushtra promulgated his doctrine. If we consider this background the Mittani word "Satta" could be related more to the Pali word "Satta", which refers to "awakened" or "knowledgeable" and not necesarily to a Sanskrit word.  
  

You may be able to throw more light on this.  
  

Regards,
