There is no evidence that the Mitanni language is pre-Vedic. Rather it is parallel to Vedic both, also to Irano-Aryan, deriving from proto-Aryan. So *satta* can be explained as new development.

The other idea that the Mitanni language, of which there are only very few examples, represents the undifferentiated Indo-Iranian language (*Cambridge Ancient History* Vol.II, p.13) which later formed the Vedic and Irano-Aryan that is to say of the idea of a linear development of Vedic from the Mitanni language, cannot be sustained. “For if the forefathers of the Vedic Ayans were still in Cappadocia in the fourteenth century B.C. … there would be no time left for them to forget all their previous history before giving the final form to the Ṛgvedic hymns not later than 1000 B.C.” (B.K.Ghosh *The Vedic Age*, 1951 p. 204).
