Dear list members,  

  

I am looking for the following book:

  

Title: Hindī Kāvya me̐ Prema-bhāvanā: Saṃvat 1400-1700 Vi (हिन्दी काव्य में प्रेम-भावना: संवत् १४००-१७०० वि.)

Author: Ramkumar Khandelwal

Publisher: Javāhara Pustkālaya, 1976

  

The work was originally submitted as a PhD thesis to Osmania University, and later published by Javahara Pustakalaya in Mathura. It seems the the book is no longer in print, though I am not sure.

  

If any list member has this book or access to a library which has it, they are requested to help me procure a copy (I am willing to bear the expenses of photocopying and mailing).

  

Would somebody at the Osmania University be able to help?
