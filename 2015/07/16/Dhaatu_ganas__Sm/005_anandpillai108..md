Thank you all. The rule 'ikstipou' is a Vartika ... The gana itself is mentioned in that name may be because Panini maharshi himself used it as 'juhotyadishu'. Through the rule 'ikstipou' the verb 'juhoti' is specially notified as a noun 'juhotih' and this denotes the 'hu' dhatu right. So what could be the right answer?
