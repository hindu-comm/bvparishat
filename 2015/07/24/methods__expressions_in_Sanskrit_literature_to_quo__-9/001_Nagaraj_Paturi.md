A projrct is going on on this topic. News:



Excerpt from Prof. Dominik Wujastyk's post on Indology list:



As an example of serious work, the ongoing research project "Fragments of  
Indian Philosophy  
\<<http://pf.fwf.ac.at/en/research-in-practice/project-finder?search%5Bwhat>\]=Fragments+of+Indian+Philosophy&search\[promotion_category_id\]=&search\[call\]=&search\[project_number\]=&search\[decision_board_ids\]=&search\[project_title\]=&search\[lead_firstname\]=&search\[lead_lastname\]=&search\[research_place_kind\]=&search\[institute_name\]=&search\[start_date\]=&search\[end_date\]=&search\[grant_years\]\[\]=&search\[status_id\]=&search\[science_discipline_id\]=&search\[per_page\]=10#search-results>"  
of my colleague and friend Dr Ernst Prets at the Austrian Academy of  
Sciences is based on the discovery and evaluation of quotations in Sanskrit  
philosophical works. In his project application, Dr Prets noted,  
  
The main aim of the proposed project is to make an attempt at  
comprehensively collecting and analyzing the quotations and paraphrases  
from and allusions to the texts of the Sāṅkhya, Nyāya, Vaiśeṣika, Mīmāṃsā,  
and Lokāyata traditions with special reference to early epistemology, logic  
and dialectics. Another major goal of the project will be the systematic  
search for fragments of texts in the philosophical Sanskrit works of the  
Jainas, specifically in the works of the Digambara Jainas.  
  
In addition, the project will investigate the Indian convention of quoting  
and referring to earlier works or views as an element of composition in  
other branches of scientific literature.
