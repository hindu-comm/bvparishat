Namaste,  
  
As regards the serious work, the ongoing research project "Fragments of Indian Philosophy, may I voice my concern about the unfortuante aspect, that the approach of the western scholars and some of our own scholars, has been to consider the Sāṅkhya, Nyāya, Vaiśeṣika, Mīmāṃsā, and Lokāyata, Vaisheshika, Nyaya (including Navyanyaya), Sankhya, Mimamsa and Uttara Mimamsa as different disciplines of philosophy , which are
trying to compete with each other. These scholars have failed to realize that these so-called separate philosophical systems are not separate at all and they are only the outcome of the enquiries at different levels. Further they do not care to consider the fact that while the Lokāyata, Vaisheshika and Nyaya (including Navyanyaya) are at the material (or vyavaharika) level the other three are at the spiritual (Paramarthika) level.
