Great comments (also by Sri Shrivatsa ji).I fail to understand the author's problem by saying - '*From the divine to the bovine, everything was envisaged by her* (hon'ble minister) *as flowing from Sanskrit.*' He says it is an extrordinary assertion.  
  
Whether Sanskrit is divine or not (let them debate), it has been established as one of the most ancient languages of the world, invariably. Ayurveda (1500 BC, at least) gives us the fourfold classification as 1. jarāyuja (mammals) 2. aṇḍaja (egg born) 3. svedaja (sweat born) and 4. udbhijja (earth born). Sthāvara (non-moving) and jaṅgama (moving) is the basis of the above four fold classification given by Suśruta. Is he not speaking to us about the evolutionary process, in Sanskrit?  
  

If the author has a real love for Sanskrit and Sanskrit students (he said it), let him come up with novel ideas to generate more employment opportunities for Sanskrit graduates and PhDs. If he has a real pain for the good of the language, let him canvas and convince all concerned to teach Sanskrit in Sanskrit medium only, as the hon'ble minister has expressed in her speech. It seems more of a political writing than an academic one. The Author occassionally writes such stuff in 'The Hindu' news paper.  
  

Any new policy of BJP's is = Hindu pro = Saffronization = Sanskrit propagation; is this the essence of freedom of expression?
