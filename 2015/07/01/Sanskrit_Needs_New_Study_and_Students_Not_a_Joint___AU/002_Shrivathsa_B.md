hariH OM,  
  
 One is at an utter loss in trying to comprehend the monumental ignorance of those who pass for writers these days.  
1. Sikha pantha minus Punjabi is nothing because the guru grantha sahib, the dasham grantha, etc. have been written / composed in punjabi. Anyone wishing to know about them "correctly", has to have a knowledge of Punjabi. Hence, Punjabi is indeed the language of Sikhism and this cannot be escaped. Same goes for Islam. The authentic interpretations of Islam come from commentators who know the tradition of Islam and Arabic.  

2\. None of the Vedanta books the author has quoted are non-sanskrit.  

3\. If it was the decision of the constituent assembly to have "India that is Bharat" then, what prevents any democratic government from overturning this and making it "Bharat that is India" by way of a constitutional amendment? What is so sacrosanct about the constituent assembly that makes its decisions go beyond democratic review at a later date?  

4\. What gives Mr. Rajmohan the exclusive right to define what he calls the "republic's biometrics"?  

5\. Mr. Rajmohan also seems to have a problem with the division of democratic responsibilities between the Executive and the Judiciary, else, he wouldn't have asserted this much: "let the Supreme Court interpret laws, the Supreme Count – majority-rule – will implement them." What is Mr. Rajmohan's formula for the country? Rule by the Supreme court?  

  

svasti,
