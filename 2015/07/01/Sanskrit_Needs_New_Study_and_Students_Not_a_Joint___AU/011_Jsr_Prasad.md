Namaste. Thanks for this information, I am benefited from it. Macaulay left behind a great legacy by bequeathing his 'ideology' to his grand/great grand children who, few of them are exposed by Sri Arun Shourie. The gist can be seen in a presentation here - <http://www.slideshare.net/IndiaInspires/arun-shourie-eminent-historians-15410533>. Also, you may be interested to watch this video in which, some so-called 'secularists' debating in the Bangalore Literary Festival 2014, and brave hearts like Arun Shourie and Rajiv Malhotra fighting it back.
