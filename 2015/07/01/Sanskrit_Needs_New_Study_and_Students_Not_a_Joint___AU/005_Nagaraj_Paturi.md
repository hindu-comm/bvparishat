Thanks Dr Raghavendra Bhat for sharing this link.



This makes it clear how the author ignored several good points in the speech like emphasis on contemporaneity in research etc.



The article writer finds fault with awards for 'foreign' scholars. If this was not done, then he would have blamed the government for not recognizing research by foreigners in Sanskrit studies and would have charged the government with anti-foreign mindset.
