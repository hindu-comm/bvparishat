Thanks aadaraNIya Nityanandji for the clarifications.



But the context was Nityanandji, Prof. Gopalakrishna Gandhi's words in the article:



"But to call it the language of Vedanta is akin to calling Hebrew the language of Christianity or Pali the language of Buddhism, Arabic the language of Islam, Punjabi the language of Sikhism."



Argument against this was that whatever the language in which Gurugranth Saheb is, can be called the language of Sikhism, because if one would like to know the original ideas of Sikhism, he has to turn to the language or languages in which the original books of that religion are composed.



'Sanskrit is the language of Vedanta' is a correct statement only is the point.
