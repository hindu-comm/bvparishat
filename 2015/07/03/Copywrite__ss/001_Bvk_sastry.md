Namaste

  

The position on copy-write is not as easy as indicated below. Copy - write protection is not automatic, unless duly claimed and guarded.

  

Reasons being:

  

1\) cyber groups are classified as Public spaces ( even when they are privately operated groups and closed groups).

Any post on a public space is treated as public knowledge/ moving out of proprietary copy right claim.

The person making the post in a public space has forfeited the personal right - claim for a copyright/ patent / intellectual property stake.
The poster has to make a considered and responsible yogic choice by ' A- Himsaa' value (= non violence/ no violation / not blocking others opportunities ) choice between self- glorification and future potential economic outcomes.

  

Not only this, such a person ' seeking instant glory for having made a first- cry from cyber-roof- top in any public space' blocks ALL others potential opportunity for ALL for using that information to any productive use! This is the most dangerous and damaging part of the copy write law, opening avenues for litigations. The life of such potentially dangerous copy-write related claims can loom through even successors who carry control on copy-write as personal / institutional inheritance.

  

This is called state of art and prior disclosures. This is a specialist legal cell area with international impact.

  

This is global law with nation specific variations under treaties and provisions. This applies to india as well any other country .( rogue behavior is a different story. So is the case of camouflaging and word twisting to re- format the idea.) there are cases where doctoral awards and patents awarded and withdrawn due to discovery of such plagiarism and previous public disclosures.

  

This law applies equally to text, images, wording- sequence et al. In this sense a web page is not a free market resource or a free shelf- space for display !

  

2\) what does this mean for sharing- posting any original research writing on a group/ public space?

  

a\) the post must carry exclusive note that the idea - wording in the post is copy-write ; any other user must get authors permission as appropriate. This is posters responsible choice in making original post or responses.

  

If not stated, the material is considered as public domain available for free of charge usage. Beware Cyber Thesis producers.

  

The web crawlers honey- comb student assignments for evaluation and pick up such plagiarism at the level of one sentence string by fine honey- combing! If caught, the consequences are dangerous .

  

b). The attachment of (c) symbol in the post; allowing which is a matter of group policy and moderators statement in group creation . The browser display of symbol characters is also to be noted.

  

Please check group hosting policy of Google/ yahoo et al and read fine prints before going for FREE !

  

c\) if and when the post maker detects some one using the posted material otherwise, explore litigation possibility if you are the one to fight! And understand legal nuances.

  

These are just the peripheral thoughts of this iceberg called copy-write.
