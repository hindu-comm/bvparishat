Hare Krishna.  
  
Dear vidvajjanas,  
I had and still have the same question. I did meet a few institutions  
running Veda-pathasalas and vedic schools in Madhva and Sri  
Sampradayas and also independent ones in Varanasi and Hrisikesh.  
Mostly they have not thought on the RTE issue as it was never a  
problem for them for decades and till they are not realizing this  
issue. But one of the Madhva gurukulas' head (name withheld) told me a  
year back that one of the main reasons they have introduced modern  
subjects in their gurukula for last few years is RTE's becoming more  
and more strict in implementation and that they do not want any  
botheration.  
There is an institute named Maharsi Sandipani Veda Vidya Pratisthanam,  
a government body, MHRD department, which gives recognition to  
Veda-pathasalas and they have their criteria in doing that. For  
secular subjects English, Maths, and Social Sciences they have their  
syllabus and anyone who wants to be recognized by them need to teach  
these and follow their norms. I saw books of their Social sciences  
syllabus and they are different from the modern NCERT syllabus, to  
some extent more loyal to vedic scriptures and Indian history (this is  
my opinion). So it seems that for Veda Pathasalas government may make  
a norm that the Veda Pathasalas recognized by MSVVP only will be  
considered recognized.  
  
Thankyou,  
Damodara Das
