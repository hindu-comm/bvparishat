An example of how reporting can be mischievous:



<http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/maharashtra-to-brand-students-of-madrassas-uneducated/article7380657.ece>



The report in the first sentence itself says, "stating that any student obtaining full-time religious education, either in madrassas **or vedic schools or any other institution**, will be considered uneducated in the State." (highlighting mine)



But the title highlights only madrassas.



In the inner pages, there is another related report



<http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/madrassas-do-not-fit-into-definition-of-schools-minister/article7380668.ece>



in which there is :



Social Justice Minister Dilip Kamble, however, said that the madrassas were never considered schools by any of the past governments



In the same report, there is:



In a bid to modernise madrassa education, the government had last month announced that four subjects — Maths, English, Science and Social Science — would be mandatory for availing government grants. “Children from those madrassas where these subjects are being taught will be considered as school-going children,” said Mr. Kamble. Maharashtra has 1890 registered madrassas, out of which 550 have already agreed to teach these subjects.



May I know from the list members knowledgeablein this regard the situation with regard to Vedapathasalas in the aspect of recognition?
