A reader pointed out the mischief in the report in Letters to the Editor:



Some elements in society appear to be imparting a communal angle to the issue of full-time religious education (“Maharashtra to brand students of madrassas uneducated”, July 3). The order clearly states that it is not just madrassas alone which will bear the brunt but also Vedic and other religious institutions. So the statement by leaders of some communities to say that this is a ploy by the government to enforce Hindu teachings is unacceptable.

Although religious education is sacrosanct, in today’s changing world it is imperative for an individual to attain some sort of scientific knowledge and this is what seems to be the aim of the government. It is these leaders who the masses look up to for support and inspiration, who should now convince the people to adopt to the changing needs of a new world rather than encourage the creation of a communal divide.
