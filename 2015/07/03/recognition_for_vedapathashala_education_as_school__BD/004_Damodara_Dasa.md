\>\>If the Vedapathashala is not funded by government grant, if it is not looking up for government grant, it need not implement the government-prescribed subjects with the government-prescribed syllabus.  
  

According to RTE Act, the school is defined and this act applies on  
both government aided as well as unaided. Also this act identifies as  
schools only those institutions that impart education according to  
government norms mentioned in the act itself. This makes it very clear  
that Madaresas, Veda Pathasalas, etc. are not to be considered as  
schools. There was an amendment to RTE Act in July 2012 which states  
that RTE is not applicable altogether on institutions imparting  
primarily religious education (primarily religious education was not  
strictly defined). So as far as I have studied RTE, it is not just a  
matter of getting grants from government but the whole point of the  
government is that every child must get basic primary education (in  
the syllabus that they have prepared). If you see education acts of  
Sri Lanka, and some other countries it is the same concept and  
basically this act, in enforcement in 180 countries, is rooted in the  
Human Rights International.  
  
This is just to try to clarify some detailed points on RTE without  
which it may be difficult to understand the issue under discussion.
