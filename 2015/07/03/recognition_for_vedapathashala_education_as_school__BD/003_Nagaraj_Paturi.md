The issue is tied up with the government grant.



If the Vedapathashala is not funded by government grant, if it is not looking up for government grant, it need not implement the government-prescribed subjects with the government-prescribed syllabus.



I know certain Vedapathashalas, not receiving government funds but including course in English on their own. They are also encouraging their vidyarthis to appear for government/university examinations as private candidates.
