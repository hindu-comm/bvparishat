Just for clarification, my point was that if some institute is not  
providing government syllabus (English, Maths, Social Science,  
Science) in their institution and still are keeping children aged 6-14  
years without making any arrangement for them to study these elsewhere  
then according to RTE that institute will come under non-recognized  
schools and children studying there as out of school children.
