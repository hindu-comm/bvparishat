Dear Prasadavarya,



I kind of get your ashaya, though I probably need to have a face-to-face chat with you on the subject.



In my view, later commentaries spend too much time on the definitions (particularly ‘anavacchinna’-based ones, which don’t really add value, IMHO), anubandha-chatushtaya, etc., so much so that it is forgotten that these are only tools for the bigger goal of establishing the truth of a matter. It is as if a book on Physics should dissect Newton’s Laws of Motion so much so that a rocket can never be spent to space… I think we need to understand the ashaya so well that we can move beyond ‘Vahnimaan ParvataH’. I may be wrong about this but I find few people being able to argue based on the precepts of Nyaya, say, the existence of the Soul.



I have studied Western Logic as a subject in Engg. I find that Nyaya is that plus more. The structure of the proof of a theorem in Euclid’s Elements follows the Panchavayavas, but has only three of the five parts in it. And he built the whole superstructure of Geometry on it. Imagine how much we could do with Gautama’s method! We need to first understand this, then advertise it to all the students of Nyaya. If we need to develop anything, it is to build a library of proofs for various subjects. You may note that Sankhya, Vaisheshika, etc., all use the method of Gautama. We can start with what we already have. Again, maybe I am not well informed…



Thanks for your kind remarks.



Hope to meet you soon,
