Very good effort! A few suggestions:  
  
- An excellent exposition on the definition of Pratyaksha can be found in Uddyotakara's Vartika.  

\- Apta is not just an 'expert.' You may like to look at the definitions of Patanjali and Caraka.  

\- The translation of 1.4.5 is inadequate or rather unclear. You may look at the example in Bhashya, 'śabdaḥ-nityaḥ-asparśatvāt'  

\- Typo - 4.1.5 (vyabhicārādahetuḥ)  

  

As per classical tradition, the śāstrakāra has to declare and confine himself to anubandha-catuṣṭaya.  
  

Thanks
