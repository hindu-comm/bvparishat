Dhanyavaada:, Prasadvarya.



Thank you for your detailed comments. I will look into them. In the third point, 1.4.5 seems to be a typo. Which sutra did you mean? Probably 3\|2\|5?



The typo at 4\|1\|5 has already been taken care of. Probably I should add an errata in the video…



I also did not get the purport of your last statement reg anubandha-chatushtaya.



Regards,



Uttara.
