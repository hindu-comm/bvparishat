Mahodaye,  
  

I meant to point out to 1.2.5 (anaikāntikaḥ savyabhicāraḥ), sorry, not as said. You may may have to curtail the translation part retaining the "i.e" part. Next, in the first aphorism itself, Sage Gautama leads us to the concept of 'tripuṭījñāna,' interpreting which, we can assume that the anubandha-catuṣṭaya is already declared. Normally, it is customary in the beginning of the text as per following verse of Kumarila:  
  
siddhārthaṃ jñātasambandhaṃ śrotuṃ śrotā pravartate।  
śāstrādau tena vaktavyassambandhassaprayojanaḥ।।  
  

In your introduction and conclusion you tried to establish that principles and techniques in Nyaya darshanam can be applied to itself. Unless the contents of the text are structured and confined as per anubandha-catuṣṭaya, it would not be easy for us to interpret the science, as you already did. So, this is a great debugging technique towards the path of wisdom. Also, you may take a parallel in the verses of Chandas, wherein the 'definition' itself is a perfect 'example' of that very definition. Happy to see, an engineer like you, is passionate about knowledge engineering!  
  

Thanks,  

Prasad
