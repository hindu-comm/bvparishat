Respected vidvadjan.

  

Recently at the 16th World Sanskrit Conference, 28th June -2nd July 2015,Bangkok I gained some exposure to current practices in translation of Scriptures, and I feel that the words, from Dr. Ananda Coomaraswamy, compiled below, on the translations of Indian Scriptures, written more than six decades ago still stand correct. Even recently published Rig Veda translation by by Stephanie W. Jamison and Joel P. Brereton which claims to be the First complete English translation of the Rigveda in over a century,and drawing on over a century of investigations of both linguistic and religious features to give a dramatically different view....though thank to claim as focusing on the poetic techniques and structures of the hymns, which may be taken as an excuse for killing the very undercurrent of the Rig Veda but it fails to the standards so set.

Also very instructive eye opener was the lecture by Dr Rajiv Malhotra<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbxzX8kwig4>

  

Hope this compilation of words (attached) will act as a reminder....

Regards

Sati Shankar
