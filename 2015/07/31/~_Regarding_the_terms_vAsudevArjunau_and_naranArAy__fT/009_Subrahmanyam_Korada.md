नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

It is almost everywhere that it would be good if someone utters the word नारयण just before death . But the questioner did not say anything like that . Even if it is the case the usage is not sustainable on that ground -

  

it is not according to the अर्थ that Panini authored the सूत्रम् - अल्पाच्तरम् or the other one . But taking the शब्द into consideration .

  

Some scholars (हरदत्तमिश्रः) argue that - अल्पाच् will do , but Panini added तरप् (in स्वार्थ) simply to show that this is अनित्य । Patanjali discussed - तरप् is तन्त्रम् (important) or अतन्त्रम् - so it cannot be अत्यन्तस्वार्थिक (नागेशः) ।

  

In the example offered by Patanjali - धनपतिरामकेशवाः - someone may put the order depending on preference etc - then we cannot effect अल्पाच्तरम् (कुत्वम् and श्चुत्वम् are not effected - for clarity - सौत्रत्वात्) ।

  

अभ्यर्हितम् पूर्वम् (वा) has got something with अर्थ - but there also
the शब्द , वासुदेव became अभ्यर्हित thru अर्थ ( individual वासुदेव)
and as such the अर्थ is not directly taken .

  

Note one thing - even when the meaning is taken the मीमांसान्याय is very much awake --

  

न विधौ परः शब्दार्थः --

  

when you apply a विधि then do not go for लक्ष्यार्थ - secondary meaning .

  

This pronouncing नारायण just before death has some proverbial importance in Telugu --

  

Both the words नार and पीचु are used to denote coir in Telugu .

  

Someone was about to die and a well wisher rushed and came back with some coir - even if the dying person utters half of the word ( नार) it
may suffice to reach वैकुण्ठम् ।

  

Showing the coir he asked the person on deathbed - what is this ? what is this ?

  

The reply was पीचु ( rather than नार) - so no वैकुण्ठम् ।

  

Everything is destined - one cannot help .
