Dear Shri Hari Parshad Das,

  

I have heard a slightly variant form of the verse quoted by Prof. Korada:

  

काचं मणिं काञ्चनमेकसूत्रे 

मुग्धा निबध्नन्ति किमत्र चित्रम् ?

विचारवान् पाणिनिरेकसूत्रे

श्वानं युवानं मघवानमाह ॥

  

Also, one may note that Pāṇini himself uses the dvandva compound vāsudevārjuna in his rule: vāsudevārjunābhyāṃ vuñ.
