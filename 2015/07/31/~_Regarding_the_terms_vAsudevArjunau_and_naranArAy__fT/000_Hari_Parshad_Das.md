\~\~ śrī-śrī-rādhā-dāmodarāya namaḥ \~\~  
  
dear vidvaj-janas,  
  
my praṇāmas.  
  
In the commentaries to the sūtra अल्पाच्तरम् (2.2.34), it is explained by the commentators that although in the term — "वासुदेवार्जुनौ", अर्जुन should have gotten पूर्वनिपात due to this sūtra and due to the previous sūtra अजाद्यदन्तम् (2.2.33), the पूर्वनिपात does not happen. This is because Vāsudeva is considered as much superior to Arjuna and is given first preference. The Kāśikā specifies this rule as follows — "अभ्यर्हितं च पूर्वं निपतति इति वक्तव्यम्"  
  
The question is then — "Why does the same rule of superiority not apply in the commonly found term — "नरनारायणौ"? According to the Mahābhārata and many other literature, नर is the same as अर्जुन and नारायण is the same as वासुदेव. Why does 'नर' take पूर्वनिपात here then?  
  
For example: The term नरनारायणौ is found in the Śrīmad-bhāgavatam (1.3.9) and in other places too.  
  
Thanks in advance to all the vidvaj-janas.
