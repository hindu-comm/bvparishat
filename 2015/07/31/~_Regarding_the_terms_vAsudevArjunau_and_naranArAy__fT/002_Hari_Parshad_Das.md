dear nityānandamiśra jī,  
  

my praṇāmas.  
  

Thank you for sending the excerpt from the vimarśa. I liked the attempt to explain the term 'rāma-sītayoḥ' by saying that in the eyes of Vāmadeva Muni, Lord Rama held a higher position because "śvasurālaye striyaḥ prādhānyaṁ vā śraiṣṭhyatvaṁ vā nāṅgīkriyate.....". That seems to be an elegant solution instead of simply calling it ārṣa-prayoga.  
  

I was thinking on similar lines too in the term 'नरनारायणौ '. My conclusion in this regard is that rather than calling this specific term 'नरनारायणौ ' as an ārṣa-prayoga, it is better to say that in the specific context of bhakta and bhagavān, pūrvanipāta expects the vivakṣā of the speaker. Thus, some may think that bhagavān is superior to the bhakta (mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat kiñcid asti — BG 7.7) and write 'वासुदेवार्जुनौ' and some others may say that the bhakta is more glorious than bhagavān (mad-bhakta-pūjābhyadhikā — Śrīmad-bhāgavatam 11.19.21 — मेरे भक्तों की पूजा मेरी पूजा से अधिक करें) and write 'नरनारायणौ '.  
  
  
Both statements (BG 7.7 and SB 11.19.21) are made by Krishna himself so one can take shelter of any pakṣa and perform pūrvanipāta of either the bhakta or bhagavān. This is specifically in the context of bhakta and bhagavān. Thus, a vaiṣṇava may prefer saying 'harihara' and a śaiva may prefer saying the same as 'śivarāma'.

My thanks again for your valuable comment.
