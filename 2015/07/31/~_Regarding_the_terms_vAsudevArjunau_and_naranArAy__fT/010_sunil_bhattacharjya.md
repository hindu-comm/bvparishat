Namaste,  
  

Lord Krishna told us that one can overcome difficulties through "Abhyasa". Now one may ask that if the dying person would have cultivated the habit of uttering the word "Narayana" as the ending word, more often in his life, such as in uttering "Nara-Narayana", (irrespective of the grammatical considerations), could there have been better chance of his uttering "Naara" than "Peechu".? Of course, I have to agree that it is easier said than done.  
  

Regards,
