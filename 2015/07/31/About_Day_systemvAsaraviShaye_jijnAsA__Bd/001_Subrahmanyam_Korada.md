नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

भानुवासरादिवासरगणना कदा आरब्धा?

                                  
--- Vidvan Mahesa

  

This issue is discussed some months ago . They are not in Vedas .

पञ्चाङगम् is a later development .

May be , since the days are common in East and West , must have entered with Greek invasion .

  

धन्यो’स्मि
