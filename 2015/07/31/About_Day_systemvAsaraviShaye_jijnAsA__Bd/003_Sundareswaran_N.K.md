Aryabhatiya (499 AD) has these verses (Kalakriyapada 16)

भानामधः शनैश्चर सुरगुरु भौमार्क शुक्र बुध चन्द्राः।

एषामधश्च भूमिर्मेधीभूता खमध्यस्था। ।

सप्तैते होरेशाः शनैश्चराद्या यथाक्रमं शीघ्राः।

शीघ्रक्रमा च्चतुर्था भवन्ति सूर्योदयाद् दिनपाः। ।

Beneath the asterisms lie Saturn, Jupiter, the Sun, Venus, Mercury, and the Moon(one below the other); and beneath them all lies the Earth like the hitching peg in the midst of space.

  

The seven planets beginning with Saturn, which are arranged in the order of increasing velocity, are the lords of the successive hours. The planets occuring fourth in the order of increasing velocity are the lords of successive days, which are reckoned from Sunrise(in Lanka).

One may refer to *Aryabhatiya c*ritically edited with English Translation by K. S. Shukla and K. V. Sarma, INSA, New Delhi,1976, for further clarification.
