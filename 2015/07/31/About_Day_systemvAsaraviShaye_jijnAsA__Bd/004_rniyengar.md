The wordवासर is Vedic. It might have been used in the sense of 'day'.
Pre-siddhantic astronomers Paraashara and Vrddha-graga describe nakshatra, tithi, yoga and KaraNa only. Consideration of 'Vaara' as the fifth-part (pan\~caanga) must have been after 100-200 AD. Now, the question is "could not the seven-day week have originated in India". This needs careful and considerable research to be conclusive enough. at the present time one of the well written paper arguing for Hellenic origin of week days in India is:



The Genesis of the Indian Planetary Deities: Author: Stephen Markel Source: East and West, Vol. 41, No. 1/4 (December 1991), pp. 173-188.  
  

The argument in favour of non-Indian origin was provided long back by Kaye:

  

The rationale behind the specific arrangement of the seven-day week is as follows: "The temporal or week-day order of the planets is an artificial one based upon the natural order \[of the progressive distances of the planets from the earth\] ? Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, the Sun, Venus, Mercury, the Moon, and was developed thus: Saturn is the lord of the first hour of the day, Jupiter is the lord of the second hour and so on; consequently the lord of the 25th hour, or first hour of the second day, is the Sun; the lord of the 49th hour or first hour of the third day is the Moon; and so on. The 24 hour day is therefore essential to the scheme and the division of the day into 24 hours nowhere appears in India ? so we must conclude that the week-day order of the planets is of non-Indian origin. Again the week-day order properly begins with Saturn (Saturday) whereas the Hindu week begins with Sunday ? and this is probably due to the same influence as with us (the Jewish-Christian week)."

G.R. Kaye, Hindu Astronomy, MASI, 18, Calcutta 1924, p. 36.  

  

However the author provides the argument against the above also:

  

*"Contrary to the view expressed here, there is an allegedly historical incident sometimes mentioned by scholars to prove the Indian origin of the seven-day week. It involves a passage in the Life of Apollonias of Tyana (3:41:17-20) by Flavius Philostratus which states that the Indian sage Tarchas gave seven rings to Apollonius named after the seven stars, and that Apollonius wore each of these in turn on the day of the week which bore its name (32). It is generally agreed, however, that a number of historical considerations invalidate the authenticity of much of the text...."*

Balance of evidence as of now seems to indicate the Hellenistic (Greek) transmission of week days into India..



Markel accepts the Vedic origin of the knowledge of planets. He also very correctly translates "Ketu" as comets and not as the descending node. But when he comes to the planets as deities to be worshiped, he seems to think the practice started late after 400 AD. I don't know why he discards the evidence of Atharva-veda-parishishta which upholds the worship of Nava-grahas, in the form of metal pieces/icons. Graheshti-BrahmaNa of KAthaka branch of Yajurveda also upholds navagraha worship. Hence symbolic worship of nine planets could not have been influenced in any way by Greek transmission. The Vedic concept of celestial "**Nine-**planets" and the extraneous "week-day-**seven-**planets" were initially mutually exclusive till a much later period when the astrologers carelessly messed up the tradition.
