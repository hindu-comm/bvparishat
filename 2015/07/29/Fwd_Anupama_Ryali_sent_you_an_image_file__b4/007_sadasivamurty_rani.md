Dear Prof. Prasad Garu,

Thanks for your compliments. Yes.. as you said it is the grace of Godavari Mata that was showered on me enabling to pen this glorious song much much unexpectedly. I sent them an Ashtka in Sanskrit and a Song in Telugu. They chose the first sloka from the Ashtaka and added the song to it and music was rendered by a right scholar-musician Dr. Vizars Balasubrahmanyam of Hyderabad.

**Humbly I submit that "panchajanyam poorayamah" was not written by me.**

  

Of course writing Songs in Sanskrit is not new task for me. So far I have written 25 Classical Dance Ballets in Telugu, Six Classical Dance Ballets in Sanskrit and one Classical Dance Ballet in English. All were staged at national level having been choreographed by experts of different classical dance schools in India. I am less known in my own Sanskrit Field than in the fields of classical music and classical dance in South India.

At the latest my Dance Ballet in Sanskrit "Sabari Moksham" is being choreographed by a Classical Bengali Dancer Kum. Anasuya who is an expert in all the six Prime Dance Traditions of India.

  

Similarly Mrs. Chitra Chakraborthy, a Bengali Dancer and resident of Pune is choreographing my Classical English Dance Ballet .."The Divine Wedlock of Radha and Madhava" from Pune.

Similarly I could write more than fifty songs in Sanskrit and 100+songs in Telugu. 

Warm regards,

**Dr. Rani Sadasiva Murty**
