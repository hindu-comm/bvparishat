My sincere thanks to Prof. NR Joshi JI, Prof. Sunil Ji, Prof. Nagaraj Paturi and others for your affectionate wishes.

My thanks to Dr. Rakesh Das also who was our student of yesteryears and an upcoming worthy scholar of present age for his response to this news.

My thanks are due to Dr. R. Anupama, who is one of my daughters of academic lineage and who brought this news into light through her little gesture and keen interest. Thanks to one and all,
