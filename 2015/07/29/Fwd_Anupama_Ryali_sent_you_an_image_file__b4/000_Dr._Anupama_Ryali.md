Dear Scholars and Friends,  
  

Namaste.  
  

I take privilege to share a special news with the Sanskrit World. It is a known news to every one that during the recent Godavari Pushkaras, The Government of Andhra Pradesh had decided to perform river Godavari Aarati. It wanted a song for this Harati and inquired for a scholar and chose none other than an epitome of knowledge, my guruji, Dr.Rani Sadasivamurtyji, who is an Associate Professor, in R.S.Vidyapeetha, Tirupathi. It would be a wonder for anyone to know that, he composed this song, in few hours, during a train journey.  
  
Below are the links of Aarati and English news paper edition and attached is a paper clipping of Telugu News Paper Edition in Telugu, of the same news.
