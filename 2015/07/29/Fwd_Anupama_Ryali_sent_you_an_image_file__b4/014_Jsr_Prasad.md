Dear Sir,  
  

Thanks for correcting me. As other scholars felt, the composition and music rendition is so soothing to ears. Eminent musician Dr. Vizars garu and Ms. Madhurima added more value to the song by music and dance, respectively. There is this distinction of a Sanskrit scholar writing a Telugu lyric and and Telugu scholar doing the same. What an amazing profile of yours! I recall our discussions related to carnatic music at Trivandrum early this year.  
  

Without hesitation, I feel that 'Jaya Godavari Mata' can be sung in both Andhra and Telangana states, where the river is equally blessing the people.  
  

Sincerely,  

Prasad
