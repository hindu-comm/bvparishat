It seems mother Godavari chose Prof. Rani garu to pen her glories in Telugu through this song. First pushkaralu in a new state and the song is a special one. His another song, '...poorayamo pancajanyam', occasionally telecasted in SVBC is so inspiring. Congratulations to a multifaceted and multilingual scholar!
