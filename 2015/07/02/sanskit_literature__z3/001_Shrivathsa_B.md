hariH OM,  
  

 you can refer to the dharmAkUtam commentary on araNya kANDa where the portends of various animals making sounds when rAma is returning after killing mArica have been discussed. If my memory serves me right, the Tiikaa refers to a grantha about portends. The same Tiika may be referred in other contexts such as: the utpaatas that prahasta and akaMpana saw when going to war in the yuddha kANDa etc.  
  

svasti,  

 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,  

 shrivathsa.
