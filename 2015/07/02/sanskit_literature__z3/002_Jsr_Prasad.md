You may also look at the episodes from 'samudralaṅghanaṃ' to 'laṅkā dahanam' in Sundarakāṇḍa (conquering laṅkiṇī, trijaṭā-svapna, destroying madhuvana etc.). A book, 'The Society of the Ramayana,' by Ananda W.P. Guruge might offer some pointers. Scholars may add more from Yuddhakāṇḍa and remaining important texts.
