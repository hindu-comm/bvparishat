hariH OM,  
  

 although the other volumes of dharmAkUtam are available on dli and other places on the internet, you will not find the araNya kANDaH. I have attached herewith the scans of the appropriate pages from the edition published by the Tanjore Saraswati Mahal Library Series Number 70, Published 1955 (111 to 128, 196,197).  
  
 For the sargas of yuddhakANDaH of interest to you with the commentary, you may download from the DLI.  
  

svasti,  

 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,  

 shrivathsa.
