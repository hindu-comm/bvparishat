This is where my point was missed \[again\]. In the context of the root ram, the accruer of the fruit of action has nothing to do with parasmaipada or ātmanepada. The reason for this is that PS 1.3.83 to PS 1.3.85 do not carry forward *kartrabhiprāye kriyāphale* from PS 1.3.74. The correct reasoning in this context is:

  

*A parasmaipada is needed because vi + ram is being used (by PS 1.3.83)*

  

and not this (paraphrasing your reasoning):

  

*A parasmaipada is needed because the accruer of the fruit of action is different from the agent.*

  

The latter is incorrect since parasmaipada is not ordained every time the accruer of the fruit of action is different from the agent. Examples of ātmanepada even when the accruer of action is not the agent: *vijayate/parājayate*. These take ātmanepada by viparābhyām jeḥ (1.3.19), even if the accruer of action is not the agent. Many other examples from 1.3.12 to 1.3.73 which precede the pañcasūtrī 1.3.72 to 1.3.76. Similarly there are examples of parasmaipada even if the accruer of fruit of action is agent, e.g. *anukaroti/parākaroti*. These take parasmaipada by anuparābhyāṃ kṛñaḥ (1.3.79), even if the accruer of action is the agent as 1.3.79 is an exception for 1.3.74 (like some other following rules).

These are *bhāvānuvāda*s, not literal translations. The literal translation of *viramanti* in this verse is 'they stop/give up/cease' \[intransitive\].

  

Discussions on grammar are solely to learn, there is no other objective.
