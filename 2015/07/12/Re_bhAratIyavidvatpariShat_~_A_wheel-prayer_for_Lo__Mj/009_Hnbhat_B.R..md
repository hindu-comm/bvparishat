I had been following the ensuing the discussion silently.

The translation of वि+रम् is too general without without without t without any twisting it to suit the context considering the following Vartika simpler than trying to make it Causative to adjust its meaning to the familiar meaning of the Hindi root रोकना which is far more twisting

जुगुप्साविरामप्रमादार्थानामुपस्ंख्यानम् (वा)*जुगुप्सा – विराम*- प्रमादार्थकधातुभिः योगे, जुगुप्साविषयस्य, विरामविषयस्य, प्रमादविषयस्य च अपादानसंज्ञा भवति । पापात् जुगुप्सते ।

There is no such usages

अधर्मात् विरमति । अत्र विरामस्य विषयोऽधर्मः । तस्य अपादानसंज्ञा भवति । अपादानभूतात् अधर्मात् पञ्चमी अपादाने पञ्चमी’ इति सूत्रेण । अधर्माद्विरमति =अधर्मविषये न प्रवर्तते इत्यर्थः ।

It cannot be said अधर्मं विरमति and trying interpret अधर्मं विरमयति and I mean it comes the meaning in translation It makes adharma to stop by resorting to अन्तर्भावितण्यर्थ usage of the verb रम् found rarely.

First of all the verb is naturally Intransitive and with the predication it be completely अकर्मक and strict translation would He ceases fro doing Adharma and not himself stops adharma. The exposition of Kashika as उपाच्च is because of the restriction to the अधिकार अकर्मकात् to justify the usage देवदत्तो यज्ञदत्तमुपरमति and the reason for such explanation is well explained in Nyasa.

Each language has its own idiomatic usages and trying to transfer to another language itself problematic. This is the real position. The true shade of meaning is given in the above example in Sanskrit for the verb than the English translation to stop or the Hindi verbs रुकना रोकना both different first intransitive and the next transitive.

This what I understand and question raised by Srivatsa was based on this difference of shades of meaning due to usages in each language. To stop is both transitive and intransitive in English unlike Hindi where there are two verbs used for transitive meaning. In Sanskrit it may need two verbs or simple verbs simple तिष्ठति स्थापयति, or स्थगयति.
