So the word bhagavadgītāsu is literally an adjective of the word upaniṣatsu. That is the reason it is both feminine and plural.


--- Prof. Deshpande



In this case, what is the reason for the plural in upanishatsu?





Finally , we may conclude that उपनिषत्सु is विशेष्यम् and भगवद्गीतासु is विशेषणम् ।


----- Prof. Korada



Then the feminine plural form of भगवद्गीतासु can be explained in terms of being the विशेषणम् of a feminine plural विशेष्यम् itself.



But words of Sankara bhagavatpaadaah are : गीताख्यैः सप्तभिः श्लोकशतैः





1\. Since it is not uncommon in Sanskrit (like in Latin and other languages ) to have विशेष्यम् followed by विशेषणम्,



2\. since all other words brahmavidyāyām, yogaśāstre, Srīkṛṣṇārjunasaṃvāde can also be taken as descriptions of 'bhagavadgItA' only,



and



3\. since the adhyAya that is the focus of the colophon has direct anvaya with bhagavadgItA only,



we may have to consider vis'Eshyatva for gItAsu.
