Thanks Prof. Korada, for putting it in perspective.



I found the 'plural as honorific' explanation from one of the modern commentaries on Bhagavadgita.



Each verse being treated as a gItA is convincing. But there is a question possible here. Do the plural in upanishatsu coming from the essence of all उपनिषत्sand plural in gItAsu coming fromगीताख्यैः सप्तभिः श्लोकशतैः apply together or separately as two mutually alternative views? If they apply simultaneously, then that leads to the meaning that each verse is an Upanishad. As such, these two as mutually alternative explanations and in each case the plural in the other word coming from विशेषणविशेष्यभावः should be more apt.



In Telugu too we find such as gItalu. (For non-Telugu audience: gIta, the singular and -lu, the plural suffix)



But in Hindi, we have the honorific usages such as गीताजी something likeगंगाजी.
