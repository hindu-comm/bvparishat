Dear Dr Mishra

Yes there was a full spectrum pf appearances at the conference, physically , intellectually and behaviourally. It happen in all the conferences and we have to find out the threads of our choice and to pick them.

So far as the analytic part in your post is concerned... concerning "infinite" and its exploration ... in analogy of the subatomic exploration.... i am afraid, it involves human mind which has a nasty habit of following the "Principle of least effort". Once we put the metaphysical part aside, rest moves to linguistics, poetics etc... i mean to the purely technical part where after initial efforts artificial intelligence takes the seat and so called professional start dancing over its toes..and their own "vivek". is subordinated to simulations...the confusion you have referred to, becomes obvious.. It has been very evident at the conference especially in Western presentations.... a few instances were astonishing...

  

Any way we have inculcated a life in India, (bhA + rat) blend with our own linguistics compatible to our own metaphysics, any absence of that blend in any one proclaiming to be a professional, be it Eastern or the Western is fated to the confusing indrajAla... well pointed out in the extant literature..... as pointed in the attachment to my post on the timeline of this group yesterday or you can find it in<https://www.scribd.com/doc/271894128/astitva-On-Translation-of-Scriptures>
