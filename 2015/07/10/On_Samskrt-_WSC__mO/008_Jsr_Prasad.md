Dear Misra ji,  
  

It seems that we are neither eurocentric nor Sanskrit centric. It is our fate, when we do not see the inherent message conveyed through rituals, customs, traditions that are highly scientific. Now I realize the intent of your word 'face make-ups.' If I am a follower of Hindu faith, I may wear a 'puṇḍra,' 'nāma,' 'tilaka,' 'bhasma' on my forehead that does not mean I am influencing the people around. All of us know that our body is the conglomeration of five gross elements and all the animate and inanimate things in the world are not an exception. What ever is created, that should be perished as the natural law (yajjanyaṃ tannaśyam). Since human body is 'pāñcabhautika,' and predominantly 'pārthiva' (earthly), it should go back from where it come. Hence, wearing any such so-called religious mark that is purely a pārthiva substance, symbolizes and indicates that this body is impermanent and dissolves into its origin. So, such religious symbols constantly remind us not to fall into the trap of worldly business as liberation is the ultimate goal. Since we need to live in vyavahāra, we need to strike a balance between 'iha' and 'para.'  
  

I have few other suggestions to think over:  

\- why a dvija wears a śikhā?  

\- why sixteen sacraments are important? For instance, karṇavedha.  

\- why women of Hindu faith, anoint turmeric on feet?  

\- why traditionalists follow 'maḍi' at homes?  

\- why one prefers to wash one's feet and hands reaching back home?  

\- why sannyāsis wear daṇḍa?  

  

The list is just inclusive. Interested may explore answers on their own. Foreign students come to our University like to put a bindi and prefers to wear chudidar etc. On the other side if we see, all of us know the fun of wearing a neck tie in a tropical country like India. Are we bold enough to comment on a person of Muslim faith who wears a beard, turban etc., when participating in academic meetings. If not, cannot we be tolerant to our own belief, though we fail to understand the purport? If our views are personal, let us not influence others. At the same time, I pity the believers who do not realize the science behind such customs.  
  

Good ideas and scholarship is just like a golden pot of creamy milk. A single droplet of toxin, would contaminates its entire nutrient values. Sorry, if this sounds harsh. Also, I make no more comments in this thread.  
  

Best regards,  

Prasad
