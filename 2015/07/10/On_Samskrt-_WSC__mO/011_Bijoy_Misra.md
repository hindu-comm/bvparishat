Looks like we are on tangents. A scholarly conference is not a cultural expo.  

People have a right to dress as they like but they should and must come out of  

any cultural bias in order to accomplish objective scholarly work. One does not  

"prove" a culture but tries to understand the veracity of an observation. I thought  

the mapping by the western scholars was more biased because possibly of  

limited exposure to the literature. Some of the scholars from the east appeared  

to put their faith before their scholarship. But a large number in the latter category  

was busy in describing the literature in the faith than analyzing the literature. The  

scholars from the west appeared to be driven by words appearing in translations  

rather than reflecting on the concepts underlying the original Sanskrit words.  

This is my personal impression from about a hundred sessions. A translation  

of "mantra"as "religious medicine" irked me the most.
