Each side is complaining that the other side is stereotyping it.



When Sri McComas satirically says that Sri Rajiv Malhotra said in his speech that

> 
> > 'The world is neatly divided into secular leftist 'outsiders' > (Westerners and many Indians who have been coopted by the system) who > regard Sanskrit as dead, oppressive and political, and 'insiders' for > whom Sanskrit as alive, liberating and sacred.', >
> 



he wants to point out that



> 
> > theworld Sanskrit scholarship is not so neatly divided. Not every > western scholar of Sanskrit is a leftist/Marxist. Not everyone of them > takes the positionfor example that Sanskrit is dead.Not all of them > look at Sanskrit as oppressive. Not everyone of them givesa political > treatment only to Sanskrit. Positions taken by western scholars with > regard to Sanskrit are variegated and thewhole picturein this regard > is highly complex. >
> 



Sri Rajiv Malhotra's response is that



> 
> > to say that he stereotyped the entire western scholarship is in fact > stereotyping him. He did not say all western scholarship of > Sanskritis alike. Hewas focusing only American scholars of > Sanskritandspecifically those of the American scholars of Sanskrit > whoseviewsand arguments resemble those of the early (19th > century)European scholars of Sanskrit who while pretending to be > interested in Sanskritused their knowledge of Sanskrit toargue > forEuropean superiority and inferiority of Indians. >

( Prof. Edward Said calls such approachof those European scholars as 'orientalism'.)
