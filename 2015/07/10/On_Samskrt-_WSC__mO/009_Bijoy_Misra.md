Dear Prasad,  

I am in Puri on Rathajatra. It's an old custom of this region. I wrote the  

legend in a book some ten years back. While it's a scholarly compilation,  

the metaphysics of SriJagannatha is not analyzed. I tried in an Oriya article  

which is just published. If you read Oriya, I can share. The point is that  

Sanskrit has little to do with any ritual or belief. Let it be experimented in  

our voice and body and let discoveries be made. Arbitrary replication is  

doable, but let us not pass it on as scholarship. Just a personal opinion.  

Best wishes of RathaJatra,  

BM
