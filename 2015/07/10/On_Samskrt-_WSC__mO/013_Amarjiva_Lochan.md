Dear Prof Bijoy,

It is great pleasure to read your observations about the 16th WSC in the past two weeks. Your rational words are worth to be pondered by any serious scholars if he/she wants to be serious. I can only lament that I could not provide a better academic platform which I have dreamt of in past 6 years since planning the 16th WSC, BKK. Stung by several local factors in the launching year(2012) including the political uncertainty, zero monetary support, and followed by a highly unwarranted call in 2013 for **Boycott 16th WSC Bangkok** by a VidvAna(?) based in two continents(which of course damaged us deeply with several withdrawals including few of the supposed-to-be Convenors opting out), I had tough time and had to create a zone ofविविधाः with a pinch of salt and pepper where mantra and tantra were too much stretched! I stand however guilty for this. Being the biggest so far, this WSC did not allow me to interact with many whose abstracts( of papers) were fascinating and path breakers( it of course included yours too!) as I was made to handle the ABC of the Conference till its XYZ. Apologies for that.

I think, we are at that Sanskrit crossroads which need to be traversed cautiously. The religiosity is fine but how about academic rigour? Pastime glories are galore but singing the past is not enough. We have to develop the skill how to combat and take up the challenges by being serious scholars, learning Sanskrit literature more seriously, knowing others more tactfully(where academics are not compromised).

Being the most unfit to converse here atभारतीयविद्वत्परिषत्, I am not having right to preach but my exposure to 9 WSCs, 15 other types of Sanskrit Conferences, and as organiser of 3 big international Sanskrit-based conferences inspire me to speak up before you all. And, please mind , when I say learning of Sanskrit, it does not mean only by ***letters*** BUT by ***spirit*** too. The complete learning of Sanskrit requires shedding of egos, unwanted pride, shamelss aptitude of thinking of *I-am-the-Best/Useless-are-the Rest*.

Warm regards

Amarjiva
