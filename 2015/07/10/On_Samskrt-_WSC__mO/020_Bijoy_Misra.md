Dear Dr. Amarajiva,  

You did a brilliant display of organization and hospitality with your very  

limited resources. People should come to learn and interact.
Academic  

rigor is a function of the respective institutions. A panel discussion on  

technical terms used in Sanskrit could be a useful exercise to bring the  

translation issues to the fore. I thought many of the western scholars  

though industrious in their scholarship are fundamentally misdirected  

through erroneous assumptions. Certain arbitrary jingoism and cult  

superiority could be observed among the eastern scholars. Possibly  

each track can have "technical session" on the Sanskrit terms, the  

concepts and the etymology to help create a common forum. The  

"religious medicine" advocate challenged me citing his own references.  

It is not the fault of the young researchers, the literature is saturated  

with arbitrary quick assumptions made on possible whims.  

Best regards and congratulations on your successful execution of WSC XVI,  

Bijoy Misra
