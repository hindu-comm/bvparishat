\>A scholarly conference is not a cultural expo.



Sure. But it is certainly a scholarly expo.



Diversity is the hallmark of any such confluence. Diversity of scholarly traditions.



\>Some of the scholars from the east appeared to put their faith before their scholarship.



When a Buddhist scholar and a Vedanta scholar talk to each other, if each of them says, 'this is my faith and that is your faith', there is no scope for conversation between the two.



If that is what happened in WSC, that was wrong.
