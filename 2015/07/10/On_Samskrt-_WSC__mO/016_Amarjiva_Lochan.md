Dear Prof Nagaraj-ji,

Namaste. Dhanyosmi! Your words are very kind!!

I have just put my observations, and believe me, I have enjoyed each of your (and others) observations.

Traditional scholars feeling the difficulty in the wake of imposed methodology requires a serious discussion. I personally feel , it is high time, we develop the 'other'methodology. However, it does not mean that we get no awareness of the 'imposed' methodology. Weaknesses and non-compatibility can be claimed ONLY AFTER one knows it in its totality. So, it is essential, some scholars hold the camp for imparting the details of the methodologies to such VidvAn-samudAya.  
Regards

Amarjiva
