Vidvan Amarjiva Lochanji,



I was and am sure such a thing would not have happened at WSC.



Let me take this opportunity to express gratefulness and indebtedness to you and other organizers of WSC, in behalf of all Sanskrit lovers for the successful organizing of such a huge event.



Even Prof. Bijoy, I am sure, wasnot making any sweepinggeneralization on the entire WSC.



The conversation was all about certain observations by Prof. Bijoy on certain small portions of the conference.



When you said,



\> I had tough time and had to create a zone ofविविधाः with a pinch of salt and pepper where mantra and tantra were too much stretched!



things are now a little clearer.



But the focus was not at all on the organizing of the conference.



It is a general question pertinent all Humanities academics, particularly Sanskrit studies.



Mainstream academics today is rooted in the modern developments in Europe. Traditional Sanskrit scholars face difficulty when they are forced to fit into this scene.



The issue is, how far is it right to impose the current 'international' methodology on them?



I am sureWSC organizers did not do any such imposing.



But this is a discussion on a general situation , an important problem we have to resolve sooner than later.



Congratulations and thanks again,



Warm regards,



Nagaraj
