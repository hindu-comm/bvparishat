It is probably the words



\>I thought I got a little clearer why the western scholars have difficulty in understanding the Indian concepts. The Indian scholars with \>some of their ritualistic conduct were adding to confine the metaphysics to a finite world. The "infinite" has no color, no shape  
\>or no make up. The anthropomorphic concept of "infinite" reduces the science of Indian metaphysics. The western scholars get \>reinforced and get further confused with such scenario.



that prompted such a response from Dr Prasad.



Prof. Misra was also critical of the religiously oriented participants from the Christian side.



It appears that he was focussing on the difficulties of cultural translation, intercultural communication etc. arising particularly in an international forum like WSC.



International participation can be of two types:



1\. The participants come prepared to communicate with each other in a form of expression that is commonly accepted as a linking form of communication.



2\. Some participants come with their own cultures and the conference is used as an opportunity to be able to witness the diversity with each observer trying to grasp the observed from the insider's perspective with a respect for the observed.



#2 being looked at as something that should not take place in an international conference is not correct.



Putting the onus of being in need of making themselves understandable to a western audience on the traditional Sanskrit scholar is not fair. I don't think even a general normalwestern participant would also demand this from them.



Even Prof. Taylor expressed his happiness to have got an opportunity to witness a vaakyaartha session in its original traditional form, to be able to interact with various strands of traditional Sanskrit with their traditional culture intact.



To imagine that some kind of metaphysical 'para' elevation of thinking can make us internationally intelligible is not realistic. The audience are not always free from their own cultural conditionings.



The costumes and rituals are not impediments if one tries to communicate in a way an alien audience understands. Many swamis of Rishikesh and other such saffron clad ritualistic persons have been able to do this. This only if one wants to communicate. There is nothing wrong if one does not intend to communicate to such an audience. The onus hen lies on the audience if he intends to understand.
