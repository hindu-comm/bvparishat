Dear Prasad,  

My view is purely personal. I think the scholarship must  

not be driven by any belief system. The scholarship in me  
should remind me that my belief could become an impediment  

to my investigation. My thinking is that Indian scholarship  

dazzles because of its pure objectivity. Awareness of the  
asymptotic nature of knowledge is the foundation of the  

scholarship in my view. Any closed thinking must be  

abandoned for new discovery.  

Best regards,  

BM
