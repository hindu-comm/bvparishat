Dear friends,  

I was in WSC in Bangkok and enjoyed the event. Being for the first time in a Sanskrit  

Conference I was indeed overwhelmed with the participation of scholars from a variety of countries and traditions. All were not there for pure scholarly purpose, many presentations also lacked the rigor of scholarship. While many young scholars did  

present papers I thought their topics of interest and method of work needed more boost and comprehension. This included young participants both from the east and the west.  

  
The western Indology has been a matter of concern. My thinking is that the scholars who have grown up in western tradition find it hard to comprehend the abstract nature of Indian metaphysics. The binary cosmology of "iha" and "para" is not easily comprehensible by anyone
let alone a person who grew up in a God-centered theology.  

Some of my good scholarly friends in the west search for the "Indian God" to compare with the "western God" and they have no clues of "Indian God". Words do not exist to translate and the lexicon God becomes the utter nonsense.  
  

I love Indian cosmology because it is scientific. It deals with the manifestation and lets us understand that a larger lot remains to be "manifested". That the process of "unmanifest to manifest" is the nature of the universe is the brilliant scientific analysis of the Indian mind unparalleled elsewhere. A western scholar would try to find an "answer"  

without realizing that the process can only be comprehended, not understood.  

It "happens."  
  

My thinking has been that we can asymptotically dig deeper into our minds to check this "manifestation" as a process. I see the creation of speech as a miniaturized version of this "manifestation", but the tools to probe do not exist. Just like Indian scholars "accept" the concept of "unmanifest to manifest", the western scholars "accept" the nuclear nature of "word". The "word" has to be broken and probed inside.  
  

While some of the Indian scholars came with various dresses and face makeups, the western scholars camped among them sharing their own vocabulary. There were some confused religious fanatics in the western camp also who probably came on behalf of their churches. They were trying to "learn" the literature in order to facilitate possible conversion.  
  

I thought I got a little clearer why the western scholars have difficulty in understanding the Indian concepts. The Indian scholars with some of their ritualistic conduct were adding to confine the metaphysics to a finite world. The "infinite" has no color, no shape  

or no make up. The anthropomorphic concept of "infinite" reduces the science of Indian metaphysics. The western scholars get reinforced and get further confused with such scenario.  
  

Everyone to think that we are in "iha" but our life is in "para" is something we should aspire for. It would not be easy, but it is the only truth there. A scholar is to become a bridge between this "iha" and "para". My intelligence does not allow me to talk about the  

third loka. People more knowledgeable may critique and extend.  
  

With my best regards,  

Bijoy Misra.
