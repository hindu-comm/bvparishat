Namaste Prof. Misra,  
  

Thank you, you are the first BVP member to respond on the proceedings of the WSC '15, who attended personally. Also, I appreciate your discerning comments on the attitude of some delegates and your analysis on 'iha' and 'para' with regard to the line of Indian thinking. But I miss some clarity in your following comment -

True, the infinite has no color, no shape or no make up. Is this the intention your referring to \<While some of the Indian scholars came with various dresses and face makeups, the western scholars camped among them sharing their own vocabulary.\>? Can you please elaborate further?

So, a scholar who can become the bridge between 'iha' and 'para,' should not be ritualistic in nature, right?
