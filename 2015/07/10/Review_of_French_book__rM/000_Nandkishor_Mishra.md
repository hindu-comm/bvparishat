Respected Scholars,

  

We are here to request our learned friends to suggest any French language knowing scholar to us for reviewing a book for our Journal. The title of the book is ‘ Demons iraniens’ by Philippe SWENNEN, published from Presses Universitaires de Liege in 2015. Since the publisher - Universitaires de Leige wants Oriental Institute to get it reviewed and publish the review in our Journal, we are seeking the help of the scholars who can help us with their might. The book will be provided to the reviewer on our expense.

Thanking you

Dr. Sweta Prajapati

I/C Dirctor, Oriental Institute,
