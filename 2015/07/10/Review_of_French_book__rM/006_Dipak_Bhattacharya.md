Dear Professor Prajapati,  
I could review if you agreed. But I am old above seventy. Many of my  
friends at BOI left the world.  
I was in France, the Netherlands and Rumania doing transactions in  
French (1981,2002,2012).  
I will require to know the number of pages. I am translating the  
PaippalaadaSamhitaa into English. I have eke out some days. But I must  
know the bulk first  
Best  
Dipak Bhattachatya
