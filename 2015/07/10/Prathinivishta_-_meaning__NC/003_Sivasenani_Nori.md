Namaste

  

प्रति (उपसर्गः) + नि (उपसर्गः) + विश् (घातुः, to enter, go into) + क्त (कृत्प्रत्ययः, past passive participle suffix) = प्रतिनिविष्ट (प्रातिपदिकम्).

  

When dhatus combine with upasargas, different meanings result. In deciding those meanings, prayoga is the standard. One cannot always say that a particular upasarga has only a particular effect. For instance, the root ख्या means to name, to tell, to make known etc. When combined with the upasarga प्र, we get words like प्रख्यातिः (= fame); but this effect is not observed when प्र combines with स्था. स्था has the sense of गतिनिवृत्तिः (i.e. immobile), but प्रस्थितः means somebody who is about to start a journey and प्रस्थानम् is a journey.

  

Still an explanation may be attempted. प्र-विश् is to enter, नि-विश् is to enter deeply, to invest; अभि-नि-विश् is to have deep interest in, to be passionate about. प्रति has a sense of \[1\], or brings out the sense of \[2\], "in return", "back" etc., leading to the meaning suggested by Prof. Nagaraj Paturi.
