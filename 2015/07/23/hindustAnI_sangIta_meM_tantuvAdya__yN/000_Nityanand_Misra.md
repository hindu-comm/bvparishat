Dear list members

  

I am looking for this book:

  

Title: Hindustānī saṅgīta meṃ tantuvādya (Stringed Instruments in Hindustani Music)

Author: Bhānukumāra Jaina

Publisher: Saṅgīta Mahāvidyālaya, 1983

  

I searched on DLI, archive and scribd and could not find a copy.

  

Any pointers are welcome.
