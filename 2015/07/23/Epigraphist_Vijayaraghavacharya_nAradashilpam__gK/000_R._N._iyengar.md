Dear Members,

I am seeking information about the person who copied the interesting Sanskrit text "Naradashilpam" which is completely in prose. It is of interest to me as it is a mix of traditional architecture and civil engineering. There are 3 copies of this paper Mss available at Adyar, Mysore and Baroda. I have copies of all these Mss. All were transcribed in Devanagari in the year 1930 by 'Vijayaraghavacharya, Epigraphist, Tirupati. In the last page this information is given and also certified यथा मातृकं लिखितम् . The Baroda Mss is verified and also signed by one 'Krishnamacharya' in Tamil. But no reference is given to the location of the original text, nor its script. It is possible the Tirupati temple might have had the above Pandit as its official epigraphist in 1920-1940 or thereabout. My suspicion is the original palm leaf Mss in Grantha or Telugu must have been in the temple library (or privately owned ) accessible to the copyist. I request Sanskrit lovers and scholars particularly in the vicinity of Tirupati to help me locate the original manuscript even if it is unreadable now. All useful information will be acknowledged if and when the Text gets published.

  

Thanks

  

RN Iyengar
