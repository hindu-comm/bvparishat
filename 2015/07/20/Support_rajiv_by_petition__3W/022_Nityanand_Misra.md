Dear Prof. Paturi Ji,

  

I agree that there is psychoanalysis being applied (the authors themselves admit it in footnote 177), and some of the comparisons amount to stretching it too much. The choice of words could have certainly been better, as one of the words used repeatedly carries coital connotations (although the non-coital meaning is also common). But do the authors say here what the blogger suggests they say? I am not sure as I do not understand what they mean by the phrase "inner phallic power." The adjective inner and the noun power suggest it is something abstract. Are they referring to an abstract psychoanalytic concept, or to the physical organ? That is the question to which I do not know the answer. Maybe we can ask them.
