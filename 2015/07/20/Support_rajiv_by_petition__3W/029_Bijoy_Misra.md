I love Valmiki's style as a poet. He has wit, fun and rhythm. Given that he weaves this beautiful story two  

thousand years ago amazes me. I feel humbled every time I touch the book. How low we really are!  

I don't think anybody in the west can measure Valmiki's poetic talents.
I do not have great command  

through the language, but I do come from a poet's family. I love the way Valmiki uses the words.  

India should think of Valmiki celebrations than Rama celebrations. Rama is Valmiki's creation.  

The "scholars' In the west have been unable to measure him not understanding the dramatist he is.  

Assuming Rama as divine, they get confused. For Valmiki, Rama is a character with some extra qualities.  

I tried to study it to experiment the effect of "rasa", I have been overwhelmed. He is the greatest  

storyteller poet who ever lived!  
  

While I see the western translation, I don't know their training nor their context, but they don't get it!
