One of the papers of mine at Bangkok had to do with the association of rasa with brain.  

Some western scholars did see me after the talk and told me their strange ideas about  

rasa. Hopefully I helped them. Now I know what they have been reading.
Some "bright"  
minds knowing a few words in Sanskrit are out to interpret the Sanskrit literature for the  
world! A Dutch man in another session was trying to map Mahabharata as a "tragedy"  
through his own interpretation. It was clear that he did not read the original text.  

  

What appeared to me there is no Sanskrit research peer group. There are individual  

teachers, but the larger dissemination gets political, either religious conservatism  

or arbitrariness in the cover of "free speech."
