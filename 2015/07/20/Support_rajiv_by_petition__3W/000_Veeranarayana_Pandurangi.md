Dear all  
Please. Support rajiv in his fight against a petition by indologists led by onejesse knutsonto harper collins for withdrawal of his books on the basis plagiarism allegation of 7 sentences of whatsoever importance in whole book.



I have not read what Rajiv has said, and probably will not, but going on discussion on indology list and Rajiv's www replies it appears that charges levelled against him are too trivial.



Iam not claiming that he is a great master or scholar. but it is our duty to support someone who is fighting for our cause.





it is important to protect the freedom of speech at all levels so

prof aklujkar noted "This must be the first time in human history that one or two missed quotation marks \[*actually seven* italics mine\] led to a petition for not publishing an author’s books"  

I request all our members to support it by going to link below.



<https://www.change.org/p/publishers-of-rajiv-malhotra-s-books-do-not-yield-to-mafia-pressure-tactics-that-seek-to-compromise-intellectual-freedom>.

It appears that some outraged people of colonial mindset (in US and Euro) want to supress him since he is the first person to take fight against them to new hight and their own court and wanted to expose hidden agenda of these people.



this petition is supported by only 200 people (but it shows that most of the names found in the petition appear to be indian, in ths list of reasons for supporting, I dont know if other indolgoists are involed or not)from 600 odd members of indology forum. this means most of indologists are sane and dont want to support this nonsence petition.



some examples of these people's hatred for Rajivare selected from indology list



Jesse Knutson, who wrote petition for withdrawal, wrote "I don’t see how any skepticism can be entertained that Rajiv Malhotra has plagiarized Nicholson’s book. This is the lowest level of academic dishonesty that would lead to a university student failing a class, and/or facing other disciplinary measures. It is pathetic, and the arrogance of Malhotra to identify himself with a tradition on purely racial grounds is both racist and absurd. He is a practitioner of the lowest level of identity politics, an uncultivated, utter fool."



Al Collins said "Malhotra is clearly experienced by most scholars on this list and RISA as a form of "plague," someone so far beyond the pale (sic!) that he needs to be definitively suppressed, squelched, cast into outer darkness, to use just a few of many available clichés for what seems to most responders here to be obvious"





Robert Zydenbose wrote "For years Mr  
Malhotra has made himself known internationally as a viciously  
aggressive ethnocentric pamphleteer without the slightest scholarly  
substance or merit of note, attacking persons intercontinentally who  
have committed their professional lives to the study of aspects of the  
culture of India and to a deepening of academic knowledge about Indian  
culture. These indications of blatant plagiary demonstrate Mr Malhotra's  
profound lack of scholarly as well as, especially, moral substance and  
deserve to be widely publicized."
