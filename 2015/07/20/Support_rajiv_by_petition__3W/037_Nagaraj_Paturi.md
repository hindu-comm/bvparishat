s'ringArarasa is not possible for the following reasons:



1\. If rAvaNa and kAmukavArAnganAs are in a mutual rati relationship, identifying with the female partner and not identifying with the male partner can not lead to rasa.



2\. sahridaya is expected to be dhArmika and that is the reason he/she identifies only with the dhArmika characters. He/she identifying with a vArAnganA happens in exceptional cases when in exceptional plays vArAnganA herself is nAyikA (e.g. in mricchakatikanATakaor when she is on the nAyaka-side (sAmAnyanAyikA which is an arvAchIna concept)



3\. Goldmans themselves are agreeing that vAlmIki is showing the scene through the eyes of hanumAn, a sahridaya who watches the scene through the eyes of hanumAn can not identify with kAmuka vArAnganAs.



4.nAyakapaksha character in the scene is hanumAn. A sahridaya identifying simultaneously with hanumAn and rAvaNa's vArAnganas is not possible.
