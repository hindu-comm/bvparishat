Has anyone checked how much overlap there is between the Hari Prasad Shastri's translation  

and the French version as alleged? It appears to me that Gita Press's Ramayana translation  

is also not original. These give openings for attacks. But to use choice adjectives by a scholar  

looks like a local insecurity. As Maricha asks Ravana "what did Rama do?"  

  

PS. I am in Maricha episode now. I love it. Nobody would get a clue unless he/she grew  

up in India.
