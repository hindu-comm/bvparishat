Thank you, Prof Paturi. I saw it but it is difficult to read (I abandoned).  

Apparently the process to destroy Valmiki was started earlier (I did not know).  

There seems to be a club of these individuals who don't understand  

poetry, have no respect to culture and see sex everywhere.  

It is unfortunate. India has indeed suffered and through that our  

children might suffer. It shows what money and power can do in the  

world. Hope India and Indian scholars would rise up!  

Who in the Government thought to give an Award? What tragedy!
