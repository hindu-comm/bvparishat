I am told that such material was created for the future Indology students in the west. In those days it was not  

estimated that the future students could be of Indian origin. I get mad when I see such trash directed towards  
our grandchildren. Rajiv noticed it many years ago and has been fighting. I support his effort. There are some  

"bright" minds in India in Government or in the academics who devour this garbage. Unfortunately we are not  
creating new material in English for the evolving youth. It is time for some serious commitment and immersion.  

We have to help create good bilingual scholars.
