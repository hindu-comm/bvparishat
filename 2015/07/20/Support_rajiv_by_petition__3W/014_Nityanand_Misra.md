I signed, not because I agree or disagree with Sh. Malhotra, but because he is being unfairly targeted by what seems to be an organized smear campaign. To see another example,[here](http://list.indology.info/pipermail/indology_list.indology.info/2015-July/041704.html)is Professor Robert Goldman, a respected scholar who has also been awarded[President's Certificate of Honour](http://www.ibnlive.com/news/india/president-gives-certificate-of-honour-to-language-experts-662546.html), speaking on plagiarism:

*... it is illuminating as David and Nancy have done, to look beyond the wretched and ignorant writings of Mr. Malhotra to examples of work in wide circulation in which the author’s unethical reliance on earlier scholarship has not been widely noticed.*  

‘Wretched and ignorant?’ If you do not agree with somebody, you call their works ‘wretched.’ And if Hindus find the writings of psychoanalysts ‘wretched,’ then they are intolerant? I seriously did not expect Prof. Goldman to use these words. I have no problem with people like Prof. Goldman taking a side on a debate, but if they use this kind of*ad hominem*language to smear Sh. Malhotra, then it is likely that their reasoning is being overpowered by their emotions.

  

I believe the missing citations to be unintentional (copy-editing slips - we are all error-prone) and I give the benefit of doubt to Sh. Malhotra as he has cited the sources elsewhere. In a normal situation, the usual scenario would be for a reader to point out that an uncited statement seems to be from/is from a specific source, and the author acknowledging, saying that a citation was missed while copy-editing and future editions would be corrected for the same. But the situation is far from normal - when we have people on Indology list calling Sh. Malhotra names, calling for the publisher to take back his books, a response is definitely needed. And what a response has it been: 9,864 supporters of the petition supporting Malhotra versus 223 supporters of the original petition against Malhotra. The ratio is around 45:1, I do not even need to bother about t-stats and p-values - never mind the‘humanities experts’ have zero training in statistics and may not be able to even comprehend what t-stats and p-values are! I hope the numbers give an idea to the ‘armchair experts’ and ‘critics’ of Hinduism of their grossly incorrect assessment of the minds of current-day Hindus (even though not all thosewho signed petition in support of Sh. Malhotra are Hindus). If they cannot read minds of Hindus (and people) in their own times, can we trust them to accurately read the minds of Valmiki, Vyasa, Panini, and Kalidasa who lived hundreds of years ago?
