I think we should be equally, if not more, cautious about trusting sources like such blogs. Is the identity of the author of manasataramgini blog known? In my view it is better to read the original source, have the context, and then make one's own conclusions than agree with somebody else's.

  

Here is the source: <https://books.google.co.in/books?id=sFmsrEszbxgC&pg=PA52>

  

The book is annotated by both Robert Goldman and Sally Sutherland Goldman. I am not sure if footnote number 176 was authored by both of them or by Robert Goldman alone, but that is irrelevant here. The psychoanalysis presented in footnote 176 is surely a stretch of mind. But are the Goldmans saying in this footnote what the blog author alleges they say? I am not sure about this part.

  

1\) The context from the previous para is that of a pure mind

2\) The exact words used are "inner phallic power." What do the Goldmans mean by "inner phallic power?" I am not sure. Do they mean "inner potency," something abstract like *brahmacarya*, or do they actually refer to the physical male organ?

  

I am neither justifying the Goldmans nor agreeing with them. I am only questioning the blog author's conclusion. If the conclusion is based on this footnote, it appears to be a grey area and not black or white. If the conclusion is based on something else, that something else needs to be brought to our notice.
