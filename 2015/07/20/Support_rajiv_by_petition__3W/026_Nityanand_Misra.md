In the footnotes cited, the Goldmans apply psychoanalysis to an episode and arrive at a psychosexual interpretation. I don't agree at all with their approach or their interpretation. Not everything can be seen with the narrow lens of psychoanalysis, and application of a modern theory like psychoanalysis to an ancient epic from a different culture is hardly fair.

  

The blogger claims Robert Goldman makes an overtly sexual comparison. I don't know if he is referring to the footnotes cited or some other text. This is a problem with relying on sources like blogs–the authors do not feel the need to cite and contextualize the topic, and so their thought process is not apparent. I am reluctant to agree until I see the blogger’s thought process.

  

They may be related, but a psychosexual interpretation and an overtly sexual metaphor are not the same. That’s all my point is. Maybe the blogger is speaking in common language as Dr. Paturi says. But even in the case of a vehement disagreement, one owes a fair representation of the *pūrvapakṣa* to the opponent. In the article, the blogger seems to have gone on a tirade, calling names and trivializing his opponents. It is quite possible (s)he stretched it \[too\] in the case of the comments on Goldman.

  

I completely agree with Dr. Bijoy Mishra that we need material in English to be authored by bilingual scholars who are truer to the traditional interpretations of our texts. English translations of the Sanskrit commentaries on the VR may result in the traditional perspective get wider readability. I would very much like the next generation of Hindu and Indian students to read English translations of VR based on Indian commentaries like *Bhūṣaṇa*, *Tilaka*, and *Śiromaṇi*.

  

PS: Philip Lutgendorf mentions in brief the view of the Goldmans as well as those of Kakar and Sattar on pages 195 and 311 in his work Hanuman's Tale: The Messages of a Divine Monkey (OUP, ISBN 9780198042204). Lutgendorf does not comment on this view, but distinguishes them as an interpretation of ‘some modern scholars’:
