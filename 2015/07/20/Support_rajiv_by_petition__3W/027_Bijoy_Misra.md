Dear Nitaynadji,  

They need not be "who are truer to the traditional interpretations of our texts."  

We need good Sanskrit scholars who read the text fully and interpret and who  
have good command of English. Most in the west translate words and get stuck.  
As I see in Valmiki, a sentence can be long and the Sanskrit words are used in  
context. The western "scholars" create their work before digesting the text,  
hence the translation looks ugly. I am not sure if they commence their work  
looking for words in sex literature. Some appear that way. I do not know the  
history. What baffles me is the possible goal of such effort while many other  
interesting work a young person could do. Is it funding or is it personal interest?  

Who is the audience?
