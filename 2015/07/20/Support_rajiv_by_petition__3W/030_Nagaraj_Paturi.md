Please read the snapshot of the last paragraph of page 50.

  

Goldmans say here, " On the aesthetic level the passage serves a need for representing the srngararasa, the erotic sentiment and enables the book and the poem to satisfy some of the formal requirements for the contents of a Mahakavya laid down in the treatises on poetics"

  

Is VR a lakshaNa inspiring lakshya or a lakshaNa-abiding or a lakshaNa-following lakshya?

  

Even according to western dates given to VR, it is book whose core was composed in 4th-5th centuries BC, completed by 2nd century BC.

  

Which treatise on poetics dated earlier to 2nd century BC laid down the formal requirements of a Mahakavya that Valmiki was trying to satisfy ?
