The Freudian analysis that the Goldmans have applied, is viable only at sub-conscious level. But Hanuman ji was fully conscious of all of his actions (अनिर्वेदः श्रियो मूलं अनिर्वेदः परं सुखम् etc.) and there might not be any 'conscous repression' as evident from sage Valmiki's words. As Prof. Paturi said, the word in debate - 'phallic power' has occured between two examples - Padmapurana and Paramahamsa, wherein they (Goldmans) refer to physical organs. One thing for sure, either the Goldmans are sheepishly ignorant of what to cite as an example while explaining the character's valiant activities, or they deliberately do the psycho-sexual analysis using a western lens. Brahmacaya is uncompromised as per sanatana dharma. Maintaining celibacy is not like a contract marriage that happens in some foreign countries.  
  

Let us keep aside the blogger for a moment and think whether the allegation is true or not. Based on a blogger's feeling, a scholar's scholarship can not be trivialized, so easily. Because respective writings/books or very much before us, as we do in the case of Goldmans. I think, most of the replies gave a serious thought in this direction. Nityanand ji's suggestion to make a *pūrvapakṣa* has to be taken in a positive note. This aspect is being repeatedly emphasized Sri Rajiv Malhotra as reiterated by Dr. Bijoy ji. I appreciate his vision and love for Ramayana.  
  
Also, I would like to see what sort of 'psycho analysis' has been applied in context of Hanuman ji's entry into Ravana's palace where several women (including Mandodari) said to be sleeping there. It is a different thing, whether the Goldmans took a 'U' turn or 'H' turn, while interpreting all the above. Congrats to Mr. Vishwas for exploring such kind of controversial things, where some of the scholars may not be verily interested, to go in to details.  
  

Thanks
