In psychoanalysis, no one ever talks of an actual physical organ and its changes being expressed in another behavioural action of the person. It is always the inner psychological entities such as drives, fears, guilt etc. that are analysed as expressed through other acts or behaviour.



I think the blogger is aware of this and was only trying to avoid the technical expressions and was putting it in a popular language.



Please compare the expressions Goldmans use in the context of Sri Ramakrishna Paramahans in the same pages.



For such analysts 'Brhmacharya' is also a kind of repression and repressions are released through various other replacements for the repressed.
