Dear Scholar-friends,  

Can you please fetch me the complete verse along with the reference to a line which goes like this:  
  

"अस्ति भाति प्रियं नाम रूपमित्यंशपञ्चकम्........." I vaguely remember this as a verse from some of the minor upanishads. I request your help in this regard.  
  

With utmost regards  
  

ganesh
