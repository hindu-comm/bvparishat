Congratulations to both Prof. Radhavallabh Tripathi Ji and Dr. Abhijit Dixit Ji for the comprehensively informative and well-presented website of Prof. Tripathi Ji. The attention to detail is evident, as an example, even prefaces authored by Prof. Tripathi Ji are listed on the publications page. A lot of hard work has gone behind the website and it is a fitting tribute to the \[ever growing\] oeuvre of Prof. Tripathi Ji.
