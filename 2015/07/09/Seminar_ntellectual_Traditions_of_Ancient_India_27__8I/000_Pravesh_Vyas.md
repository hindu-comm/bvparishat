Dear Madam/Sir,

Greetings from Center for Ancient History & Culture, Jain University

  

I am happy to inform you that CAHC is organizing a 3-Day Seminar on a topic of current interest connected with our ancient history and culture.

  

You would have read in the newspapers about the controversies regarding airplanes, space travel etc in ancient India after the Indian Science Congress (January 2015). You might have also watchedthe high decibel discussions on the subject of so called " Vedic Science" on the national TV channels. Such controversies, sometimes with political overtones, made us at CAHC to discuss the issue with a group of persons drawn from different backgrounds, all genuinely interested in Indian culture and traditions. The conclusion of this group was that the general public are not properly exposed to scientific concepts and discoveries that have had their origin in the Indian subcontinent. The present program is a first attempt to address the above issue through a set of lectures, that are not too technical, on a few selected topics of wide general interest, including an "Avadhaana" demo and a cultural program. Please see the enclosed brochure for details.

  

I request you to promote the Seminar by registering for the event and participating in the discussions. Also please encourage your colleagues, students, family and friends to take part in the Seminar.

If you have any queries please do not hesitate to write back to me.

Thanks,

  

R.N.Iyengar
