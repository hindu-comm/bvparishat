I found a tabulation of gItAvAkyas and the S'rutivAkyas which Pujya Swami Nirvikalpananda found to be the source of those gItAvAkyas, in a Telugu book published by Ramakrishna Math , Hyderabad.



Is there a similar collection available elsewhere?



If any list-member is interested, I will share the collection madeby
Pujya Swamiji, typing it in Devanagari.
