Namaste,

  

Bhagavad Gita with English commentary by B.R. Charan published in the series, "Sacred Books of the Hindus" contains extracts from Sanskrit scriptures, though the scriptural quotes are not in one place. They are given below respective Gita slokas.  

  

Link to SBH edition of Bhagavad Gita is available at <https://archive.org/download/Sacred_Books_of_the_Hindus/SacredBooksOfTheHindusVol00-BhagavadGitaWithEnglishTranslationExtractsFromHinduScriptures-BrCharan1928.pdf>

I found a tabulation of gItAvAkyas and the S'rutivAkyas which Pujya Swami Nirvikalpananda found to be the source of those gItAvAkyas, in a Telugu book published by Ramakrishna Math , Hyderabad.



Is there a similar collection available elsewhere?



If any list-member is interested, I will share the collection madeby
Pujya Swamiji, typing it in Devanagari.
