Namaste. Interesting reference to the equivalent of vardhāpana. Prof. Karmarkar's translation is true to the wording of Mallinatha. He has explicated 'सभाजनाय' for 'अभिनन्दनाय' in the commentary. Then, it would be something like सभाजनम् = अभिनन्दनम् = वर्धापनम् ।  
  

However, it may be that 'सभाजनम्' is used in the sense of 'felicitation,' mostly. When you are congratulating someone, then you would normally say 'वर्धापनानि,' or 'अभिनन्दनानि.' Interestingly, as per Oxford English Dictionary, both the words, 'congratulations' and 'felicitations,' are synonymous with each other!
