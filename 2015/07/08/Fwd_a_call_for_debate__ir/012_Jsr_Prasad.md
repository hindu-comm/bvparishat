Few more points made by Sri Krishnashastry, needs our attention:  
  
- Action plan for 2015.  

Would appreciate if other scholar members add their views on this point.  
  

\- Quality of PhD theses produced by Sanskrit departments.  

Writing PhD thesis in Sanskrit is a compulsion in Vidyapeethas. Quality of teaching is far far better than any other institution, but purely in a traditional way. Vidyapeethas have preserved the continuous flow of invaluable teaching methodologies handed down to us over several millennia. When it comes to other institutions, his question might be relevant - 'what is the utility and shelf value of such theses?'  
  

\- 'Teaching' Samskrit or 'teaching about' Samskrit?  

How long can we teach 'about' Samskrit? So, there cannot be any hidden danger (?). To make an analogy, I see a great difference between 'meta data' of a manuscript and the 'content' of a manuscript.  
  

\- Impact of established Samskrit Universities.  

Look forward for any comments! It seems that four more new Universities would be set up very soon.  
  

\- Job oriented courses in Samskrit.  

Is it difficult to devise short/long term part/full time courses in Indian Management, Yoga for Health, NLP etc.? Rashtriya Sanskrit Vidyapeetha is already a forerunner in this context. Vedic University has plans to start B.Sc. Herbal Science and other courses. Traditional institutions adopt a quick change as per the needs of the student community whereas Sanskrit departments of state/central Universities continue the same old syllabus, that needs thorough revision.  
  

Thanks
