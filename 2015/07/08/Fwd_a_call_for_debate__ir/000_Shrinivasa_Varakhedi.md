Dear all,  
  
I was silent reader of Bvp for last several months due to my occupation. Now I am considerable free to be active in Bvp debates. I start with an article by SRI cha mu Krishna shastry a senior leader of Sanskrit Bharati who has given a call to Sanskrit professors from the Dias of 16th world Sanskrit conference. Many have gone to the conference. Many others did not go. I invite one and all to take part in this dialogue for the benefit of Sanskrit community.  
  
Please find the attachment herewith for a quick reading. Sanskrit version is available in latest Spl issue of sambhashana Sandesh which is available on net also. I will forward if anybody wants the same.  
  
Some of the points raised in this article are worth to consider for a serious debate. They are worth to accept or to reject. But one should not neglect such a serious proposal.  
  
Recently we may recall that a serious observations made by prof Ramesh Chaturvedi from Delhi about the union govt move on Sanskrit. His remarks are also to be noted while discussing these matters.  
  
With best regards  
Shrivarakhedi
