Rashtriya Sanskrit Samsthan has a scheme to donate books as complimentary to the institutions. Not sure, whether pathasalas are part of this. Most of the journal publications are in English. Reputed Sanskrit journals like 'sārasvasatī suṣamā' are neither regular nor scholars wish to publish scientific papers in them. Are our traditional students of pathasalas, equipped to read and understand the academic English? As of now, we have good availability of quality books published in the interface of Sanskrit and science. Do they have access to the language and materials? The apex bodies, Rashtriya Sanskrti Samsthan, Maharshi Sandipani Vedavidya Pratishthan etc., have to be more pro active to revamp the entire syllabus teach some modern subjects.

I completely agree. But the spoken tendency inspires them to read the books, like Gita, after learning the basics of grammar. Is it not an incentive? Instead of converting to other religions, let them come back home! I too say that by popularization of spoken Sanskrit does not give a facelift to language study. But we must be fair enough to generate interest amongst our own students and family members. And, let us not compare other Indian/foreign languages with Sanskrit. Without a formal training in Sanskrit, most of us assimilate the rich cultural values and ethics stored in Sanskrit, absorbed through respective mother tongues. Hope, many may not disagree.

This is what Sri Krishnashastry was saying about the 'relevance.' Ordinary people will enjoy the fruits of the labour put in research projects that might have addressed the contemporary 'relevance' of Sanskrit-science. How many faculty members submit scientific research proposals to funding bodies like DST, UGC, INSA, ICAR, ICHR etc.

I am afraid, if Govt starts to fund the such research projects, people may start to grumble about so-called pro-Hindu activity of the government. How to bell the cat?

All of us have an equal share in dispelling such ignorance, by writing books/monographs on 'relevance/scientificity of Sanskrit' in local languages, on blogs, websites and lecturing through videos etc. The term 'indology' is more popular in the west than in the east. But we need 'genuine' indologists not detractors.  
  

Why is that an individual like Sri Rajiv Malhotra waging a lone war against the anti-Hindu propaganda? He is going to publish his recently completed book - 'The Battle for Sanskrit.' How many of us think in that line or even know what such individuals are doing for the sake of our culture? Is it not our collective responsibility to defend our culture that is under continuous attacks and distortions by some 'Indologists'? Or simply sitting back, we are interested to debate upon things like, it is 'Sindhu' but not Hindu?
