Respected All,  
  

Thanks to Prof. Shrinivasa Varakhedi ji for bringing this important issue to the notice of BVP members. Sri Phani Kumar ji and other have already posted a video of his talk.  
  

Though, most of you might have read the attachment, for the convenience of a debate, I am herewith giving the gist. As much as I followed, Sri Cha Mu Krishna Shastry ji has expressed the following concerns and gave a clarion call to all the Sanskritists from the venue of WSC '15.  

  

1.  **Imbibing Sanskrit:** Being a Sanskrit scholar, make Sanskrit your
    own language (speak and preserve), instead of groaning and
    complaining over governmental policy issues  
2.  **Sanskrit Universities:** When there are no students studying
    Sanskrit at school and college levels, what would be the point in
    demanding for more Sanskrit Universities, when departments are
    shutting down at collegiate level? 3.  **Sanskrit Pedagogy:** Are we really serious about Sanskrit
    pedagogy? Have we ever thought to teach Sanskrit in innovative ways
    adopting modern trends? For instance, he said, very less number of
    papers were received in Pedagogy section of WSC 2015. 4.  **Scientific Sanskrit:** How Sanskrit is useful to contemporary
    problems and future demands? Otherwise it has to bear the brunt of
    the contemporary times. Can it be useful in innovating and
    discovering something from a scientific perspective? That sort of
    Sanskrit education should be imparted. Connect Sanskrit with modern
    world. 5.  **Out of box thinking:** Vision 2025; what has to be planned by
    Sanskrit academia? Fix up short and long term goals. 6.  **Training the Teachers:** There are 5 million Sanskrit teachers in
    school education, who cannot teach through the medium of Sanskrit. 7.  **Simplified Sanskrit:** What type of Sanskrit is demanded as an
    official language at state/central level – simplified Sanskrit 8.  **Govt Policies:** Very soon, Govt of India may announce that
    Sanskrit teachers should be sent out to teach in 100 different
    countries – are we ready with the challenges and opportunities? 9.  **Samskrita Seva:** Guidance and counselling to young scholars by
    senior most scholars and scholar administrators is strongly
    suggested – one should render selfless service with dharmic life.

Lastly, Sri Shastry ji put his words in a nutshell:  

-   training Sanskrit teachers

-   connecting Sanskrit with modern world

-   strategic transformation of Sanskrit institutions  

-   discoveries and innovation in/through Sanskrit  

-   relevance of Sanskrit - whether Sanskrit is relevant or what is
    relevant to Sanskrit scholar?

  

And here is my take:  

  

1\. Some of us may think that spreading the spoken Sanskrit moment is the onus of Samskrita Bharati (SB), not ours. In fact, impact of SB is not to be belittled. Due to its incessant efforts, year 2000 was announced as 'Sanskrit Year,' besides many many more other achievements. Even SB created ājīvikā for hundreds of unemployed Sanskrit graduates to work on full time. They brought to light several publications with regard to Sanskrit and science. Remember, the edifice of SB has been built upon the voluntary and selfless efforts a few dedicated scholars. Did we close our eyes to this reality or simply pay a lip service?  
  

Not sure, whether you are aware, of the comments made by Prof. Sheldon Pollock (President's certificate of Honor & Padmashri awardee) about spoken Sanskrit. He said (in one of his books?) - "*You know this whole spoken Sanskrit movement fills me with a kind of nausea. The point is not to be able to go out in the streets of Bangalore and order a cup of chai in Sanskrit, the point is to establish serious *phi-logically grounded*, *historically-sensitive*, *theoretically …self-aware scholarship* on Sanskrit to make it into an instrument of the creative preservation of the past and creative critique of the past.*" (underlining is mine.)  
  

a\) Are we indifferent when Prof. Pollock points to the serious philological research that is based on the 445 Indo-European Language family classification? b) Has not Sanskrit is lost its historical sensitivity, since it was fabricated to the needs of colonial rulers? c) In recent times, Bellamkonda Ramaraya Kavi within a lifespan of 32 years has produced more than 150 authentic works, which is not very easy to comprehend by scholars. Late Padmasri M.M. Pullela Sriramachandrudu had produced about 270 works. And we can proudly proclaim that (because we're very much living in his times!), Mahamahopadhyaya Prof. N.S. Ramanuja Tatacharya has written authentic commentaries in Nyaya and other Shastras, who is the first ever recipient of 'Chevalier de la Legion d'Honneur' of French Government. I can go on adding such names of great souls even from north India.

  

2\. Except a few states, say three or four, in our country no other state is serious about imparting Sanskrit education, especially at school level. In Kendriya Vidyalaya Sanghatan, Sanskrit is not being taught from 10th standard. That means, students are deprived further in 11th and 12th classes too. Why should not it be made compulsory. Hope, the new MHRD policy on substituting German with Sanskrit in KVs, would be productive in future? Not only that, all Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas should invariably make a choice to offer Sanskrit from 6th standard. Need not mention about all other government run schools. Once enough number of self initiated students are produced through collegiate education, then, demanding for more Sanskrit Universities may makes sense. I second Shastryji's words. Basically, one should think about generating more employment opportunities.  
  

3\. Scholars well versed in Shastras, should give lectures on Sanskrit pedagogy to enlighten the younger teaching generation, in colleges and Universities as well. One has delve deep into the Sanskrit research methodologies. There should not be any 'hypo' in this 'thesis.' तद्विद्धि प्रणिपातेन ...  
  

4\. Indeed, I beg to differ here. Because, science and śāstra are not one and the same. In the bigger purview of śāstra, science accommodates itself. The former is surely to give 'indriyātīta jñāna' whereas the latter, gives, mere 'indriyagatajñāna.' However, in IITs and some central Universities, including Vedic and Samskrita Vidapeethas, considerable research work is going on. I believe, we would be able to show the outcome very soon to the world, in different scientific dimensions. Also, annual convention of Sanskrit scholars and scientists is so desired. This gesture would boost the morale of the 'Sanskrit and Science' section of the forthcoming World Sanskrit Conference.  
  

5\. Comments are invited! But I am curious to know what the second Sanskrit commission has packed for us in its report submitted to the central government. Look forward to the govt reaction for its proper implementation. All the points discussed by Shastry ji, can be orderly classified in to long and short term goals. May be we can add more to this.  
  

6\. SB is one of the resorts in this context, apart from devising some innovative ideas to implement 'teaching the teachers.' Perhaps, it would be a good idea to revive the the old MHRD's scheme on 'saskṛta-saṃbhāṣaṇa-kendras, in each institution?' Organizing workshops and colloquiums may also be encouraging. Let us recall the words of Smt. Sushma Swaraj during her speech at the WSC '15.  
  

7\. Saralabhāṣā has to be encouraged while protecting the sanctity of śāstrabhāṣā of ancient yore. Creative literature helps us making it simplified for lay men. But how to reconcile for successful propagation? For me, Sanskrit as official language of India is a distant dream, due to several constraints.  
  

8&9. Highly debatable points!  
  

Shall look forward for more inputs by scholars. No offence is intended and apologies for a long reply.  
  

Kind regards,  

Prasad
