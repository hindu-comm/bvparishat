Does it mean we need not to do anything in this direction as Ayurvedic institutions offer 'B.A.M.S.' course?  
  
I have different views. There are 3-4 Ayurvedic Universities in India. 95% of the MD theses are based on clinical studies, if I am not wrong. Very few students opt to work in basic principles/samhita siddhant at MD or PhD levels. Nonetheless, a select few only go for PhD in Ayurveda. Apart from this, all graduate and PG degrees of Ayurveda, are awarded by state run medical Universities. For instance, Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences, Bangalore. But their syllabus is planned and approved by Central Council of Indian Medicine (CCIM). As part of the [syllabus](http://www.ccimindia.org/syllabus/UG_Syllabus_Ayu_2012.html), BAMS students study Sanskrit grammar for 90 teaching hours and Padartha Vigyan for 150 teaching hours. The latter includes all the discussion on epistemology and metaphysics. CCIM is controlled by ministry of [AYUSH](http://www.indianmedicine.nic.in/). What we wish to see is that the UGC should take some initiative to ease the regulations such as inclusion of Ayurveda (I believe, Yoga is there) in Sanskrit departments, in NET exam and so on and so forth.  
  

If we keenly observe, whatever we speak of 'interdisciplinary research' in current times, has been amply reflected in our ancient literature. Sage Patanjali is a perfect example of interdisciplinary research as per the verse - yogena cittasya padena vācāṃ malaṃ śarīrasya ca vaidyakena । Subsequently, most of us are of this quotation - 'iti carake patañjaliḥ.' Hence, great Bhartrhari also says -  
  
prajñā vivekaṃ labhate bhinnairāgamadarśanaiḥ ।  
kiyadvā śakyamunnetuṃ svatarkamanudhāvatā ।।  
  

That was just echoed by Vagbhata as -  
ekaṃ śāstram adhīyāno na vidyācchāstraniścayam ।  
tasmātbahuśrutaḥ śāstraṃ vijānīyāt cikitsakaḥ ।।
