I am afraid, are we still seeing things in a 'Sanskrit centric' perspective. I did not mean to say, Sanskrit institutions should produce 'medical doctors.' First of all, let us come out from this 'medical' sense of Ayurveda, then everything will be clear. Well, about comment on UGC. Let's take an example. Can a scholar with a good Vyakarana background and degree, be allowed to inducted into a Samhita Siddhant/Basic Principles department? Similarly, could an MD in the samhita siddhant finds him/herself accommodated in a Sanskrit department? This was otherwise attempted in my previous post. When we speak of 'interdisciplinary research,' or 'out of box thinking,' we should break all barriers that prevents the projected growth.  
  

To add to the above, in a reputed central University, faculty joined with MD in modern medicine in the school of medical sciences, are facing legal problems as they don't posses PhD as per UGC. Ironically, UGC guidelines allow appointment of such faculty without PhDs. Is it not a perfect dichotomy between theory and practice? I think we've discussed enough on spoken Sanskrit and Ayurveda. Would not it be better to concentrate on other points of the debate.
