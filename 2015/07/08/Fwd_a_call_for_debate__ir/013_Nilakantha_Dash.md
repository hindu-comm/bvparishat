Dear all  
I was reading all these. I heard CK Shastry sir many times giving good  
suggestions about sanskrit, writing and teachng. I agree with Mr.  
Prasad. In fact subjects like Yoga and Herbal things are popular now.  
Lot of innovative things are happening in both.  
There was a senior lady in Pune, who studied Sanskrit with grammar as  
her special paper and letter established one lab to test the  
authenticity of Ayurvedic medicine. (claim of the content is correct  
or not)  
I heard a teacher of University saying, why people of other  
departments(say linguistics, philosophy, MILngs etc) call or come to  
me when they coould not understand a topic or a shloka or a quotation.  
Is it not better to create a post of Sanskrit pundit in your  
respective departments, who can guide the department with sanskrit and  
allied courses. No that is difficult.  
But I feel to think finding better paths of teaching sanskrit.ndash
