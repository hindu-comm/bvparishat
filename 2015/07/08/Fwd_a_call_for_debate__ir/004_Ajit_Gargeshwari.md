Sanskrit if it at all needs to studied seriously in universities and if one needs to develop high quality scholars; Scholars and students need to know what there peers contribute to journals and books and not be like frog in a well. There is a need to update libraries across India especially the traditional pathshalas where Sanskrit is thought if it has a utility beyond the texts they study. Its not enough in a given city there one library where students of one university can access journals and high quality books apart from their prescribed text books and others students scholars cannot access them and hence will not read them.  
  

On the issue of popularizing spoken Sanskrit I am not gainst it its good it has to be done. This iaa my viewLets assume Teachers & students can speak well in Sanskrit that doesn't indicate they know Sanskrit well or are scholarly enough for millions know to speak English or Hindi well that does not make them scholars. Learning a language which is in day to day use will enable everyday work to be done and the need to learn Sanskrit at higher places of learning is purely for scholarly needs which will benefit the society by their output and writings.  
  

The larger big picture is to have a team of scholars who can bring out reasons why sanskrit requires funding and how ordinary people will be benifited from learning Sanskrit ? Why should one know our past and how relavent is it to our present Whats the role and imporatnce of classical language and many other related questions. if public are made aware of this in non emotive manner without bringing is and associating Sanskrit with relegion more funding from goverment can be expected and we will be able to perform better in international arena. The situation now is if I say I am lerining Sanskrit the next question asked is are you a Brhamin? Can you tell me when I will get rich How can acquire supernatural powers.? and If you say i am Indologist most people ask whats that?
