Thank you Prof Jha and Prof. Deshpande. I am glad you put my point on the utility of spoken Sanskrit in the right perspective.  

End of the day the government must and I hope will listen to the views of scholars not me in the larger interest of cultural continuity and immense contribution Sanskrit studies can do to society in various ways.  
May I request more members most of whom on this list are were involved in policy making at very high levels to contribute towards this thread
