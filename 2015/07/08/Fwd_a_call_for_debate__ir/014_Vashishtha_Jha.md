The need of the hour is not to allow emotion to overpower rationality. Encourage the learners to get **thorough** acquaintance with the traditional systems of knowledge ( **definitely not through spoken sanskrit programmes . Such programmes have very limited purpose** ) , provide exposure to the parallel modern knowledge domains and contemporary discourses and ask them to think deep, compare and contrast, in order to identify the areas of application of those classical knowledge systems today. If this is done meticulously, the relevance will emerge automatically. Classical India is the treasure house of knowledge domains which have deeper contemporary relevance. But by simply making such statements nothing is going to happen. We must demonstrate it through application. Let the society experience it and there will be a natural demand for learning Sanskrit from the society.

  

But where are the teachers to motivate the students in this way ? Hence, we need to create such teachers first in both the streams : traditional as well as modern.

  

The goal must be very clear, the path can be created to reach there. Government must concentrate on rational academic advice and not on advice based on emotion. But who am I to tell the Govt. ? There is very bright future for Sanskrit.
