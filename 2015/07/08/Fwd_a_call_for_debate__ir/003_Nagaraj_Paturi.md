One important observation in this is to point out theTHEs



There is this tendency of talking as though there is only one theoretical or academic context or there is only one larger picture and every new contributor has to be in dialogue with that one context or picture.



This demand is what many traditional Indian Sanskrit scholars find hard to meet and when try to venture without meeting the demand, get laughed at.



Prof. Haubenbrought in a highly relevant point for discussion.
