I agree with the comments made by respected Professors V.N. Jha, Madhav Deshpande and also the nice comments made by Prof. Varakhedi, Sri S. Subrahmanya, Sri Shrivatsa and Sri Ajit.  

  

Two quick comments:  
  

I feel that an exclusive interdisciplinary University (or Universities) should be established to to show the utilitarian part of Sanskrit to Humanities, Social Sciences and the Sciences. Scholars would be working on subjects like, law, economics, political science, architecture, Vedic science, Ayurveda, mathematics etc., in such an institution. But eligibility criteria of the students should be open to other streams too, conditional to a small bridge course. IITs are the best science institutions in our country. However, they wanted to conduct advanced research in sciences, hence, Govt. started IISERs in several parts of India. Some IISERs also have humanities departments like in IITs.  
  

Offering Ayurvedacarya courses in Sanskrit Universities is a good idea suggested by Prof. Varakhedi. Though all Ayurveda samhitas were written in Sanskrit, there is no mutual dialog between Sanskrit and Ayurveda scholars/doctors. Need not to state the poor knowledge of Sanskrit of Ayurveda graduates. When a Sanskrit scholar trained in Ayurveda, he/she must have avenues in the state/central run Ayurveda colleges or institutions. Subsequently, we can aim for more quality research if this happens. All old generation Ayurveda scholars were/are good in Sanskrit and good number of old generation Sanskrit scholars were/are also good in Ayurveda. For instance, Pandi Satyadeva Vasishtha etc.
