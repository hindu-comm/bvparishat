As suggested by Sri Ajith, we will move to next level. I had proposed in my earlier mail that we should start thinking “out of box”. I have some points to submit here.

  

1\. So far we have been thinking about Sanskrit and all our focus is on Sanskrit. This “sanskrit-centric” thinking was never found helpful for the progress. As long as we continue to think about Sanskrit in this way, we don’t see anything else than ‘problems, constrains, and challenges”. Let’s change the dimension. The entire situation gets changed, I am sure. First let’s give up our “sanskrit-centric” thinking and planning.

2\. This is the time to think about the betterment of the world keeping Sanskrit in view as a tool. Now things will change and our perspective will change. All problems will disappear when Sanskrit is looked as an instrument. Immense Increase of National population is a problem for a good economy. However, for economy of a developing nation, the population could be an advantage interns of human resources. This is how our perspective makes difference. I therefore insist Sanskrit policy makers to stop thinking about Sanskrit. We will start thinking about nation and its progress. Life becomes easy. All our problems will slowly disappear.

3\. Once we come out of box, we can see many things which were not seen before. There lies the future of Sanskrit. My proposal may be very abstract but I hope this way will lead us to specified goal.

4\. One such plan could be : all Sanskrit higher learning Institution should stop offering conventional courses. Instead they should act as consultants and research centres like IIMs and IITs.

5\. Ayurveda could be one such field where Sanskrit scholars can closely be associated. Hence, offering full-time Ayurveda Pandit course in Sanskrit varsities would open up new avenues for both the disciplines.

6\. More over we need to come out of the “grant-in-aid” mindset. As other educational disciplines can survive without Govt Grants, why not Sanskrit Institutions ?

  

We can think in similar lines and come up with some working plan for next 25 years. Governments will take time to execute such plans. But, we should be ready for future. Future-complying plans will certainly pay well, rather than the present problem-solution-driven plans do.

  

Inputs from scholars are welcome.

  

with best regards,

shrivarakhedi
