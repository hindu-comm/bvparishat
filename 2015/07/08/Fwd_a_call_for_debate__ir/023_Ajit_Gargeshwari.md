Let me begin my views in two sections

Section 1  

At the outset

 

I would like to thank Karnataka Samskrit University for

their complete support and corporation towards this section. This is not new. I am summarizing the views expressed in several small discussion I had professors and scholars working there.  

  

DLI has scanned thousands o

f

Sanskrit and Indological books we can create an index and give the DLI link to the index so that searching for Sanskrit and related books becomes easier. A web page can be created giving the corrected tile of the book author name, editors name publishers name year of publication etc This information can be created and hosted on a web site---- click the link it would take the reader to the DLI resource. This can be easily done without big knowledge of programming or high cost but is a labor intensive process.  
  
Scanning a book is the first process, OCR, creating an index ,making the book searchable, converting scan to a Unicode version proof reading and finally hosting them to website. Lets start with the first step first. As a first step let us have a pool of high quality scanned all Sanskrit
and Indologigical books published between 1850-1950 DLI has 60% the rest need to supplemented by university funding as is being done by the best universities of US and Europe.  
  
Before scanning of libraries are undertaken its important that a scanner or the vendor to whom the project is outsourced has complete knowledge of books that is already digitized at least he must know those that are in public domain at least.. DLI has done such mistakes The same books has been scanned again and again by different scanning centers Future project can avoid this. A consultant should be appointed who with the university professors can co-ordinate the process

.  


  
Universities should bring a comprehensive policy how it will safe guard it digital assets and how Intellectual Property or Copy-write laws are not compromised in the process.  

  

Several high quality Sanskrit Journals in Sanskrit an English are being published by various universities some are continuing and many are defunct. All Such Journals can be digitized and be made accessible we can create a site similar JSTOR and Call Sanskrit Store where all periodicals and journals related to Sanskrit and Indian culture can be accessed for a fee. Old high quality magazines which are60 or 70 years, old back issues and those that are defunct can be given free of cost. Please see issues of Praci Jyoti this journal will give an idea as to how many Sanskrit and Indological periodicals are being published in India alone.  
  
Section 2  
An unconventional approach is to de-link eligibility criteria to gain access to courses Seminars and Talks arranged by Universities.  
  
Universities can introduce fee based courses for serious enthusiasts who want to learn Sanskrit, Indian philosophy, Linguistics grammar and other related areas on Sanskrit and give informal courses and issue certificates  

  

Participating in such courses, will not be a substitute for a regular course but participants can be given credit and can be encouraged to take regular courses. The University can charge for such programs and it need not be given free. If response in good the money collected can be given to the person conducting such courses . These courses can be scheduled on week ends or at times when class rooms of University are free.  
  

I know universities do have evening collages or correspondence programs. Informal courses will act as a midway between Open University and formal University. This approach may be more relevant to Sanskrit and Indian culture studies as we have a lot of people who want to know more but don't know where to start and if they start how to progress and deepen their knowledge.  
  

Computer terminals can be set up at libraries where enthusiasts and general public can access high quality books and journals available with university on a fee basis. A volunteer from the university can act as a guide if people visiting the library need to know what read how much read whats difference between academic reading and popular news paper reading. Only E books or books in public domain can be shared with public if publishers or librarians object to their materials are being used.
