hariH OM,  
  

 I haven't read all messages on this thread and hence what I say here may be a repetition and request your forgiveness for the same.  
  

1\. There is a mindless policy adopted by universities to allow Sanskrit PhD theses to be written, presented and defended in English / regional languages. This has made Sanskrit PhDs the haunt of all those who are too lazy to learn Sanskrit, but want the airs that go with a Sanskrit degree (few of them who want to get hold of the degree to pull wool over the eyes of those who don't know anything in Sanskrit / shaastra). This has to be stopped forthwith. If not possible to stop forthwith, there should be a rewards scheme to start with (something like: Rs. 3 lakhs for a thesis written, presented and defended in Sanskrit etc.)  

2\. The national catalogus catalogorum has thousands of books on important subjects and they are lying in manuscript libraries without people even knowing what their substantial contents are (apart from what is given in the NCC). It should be a policy of universities to have a percentage of their PhD students work on such manuscripts with guidance from subject experts (E.g. a sanskrit student having a guide in X university and Y Ayurveda pratiShThAna). This will also help bring the Sanskrit communities who are part of a bigger ecology together.  

3\. The defensive mindset of the setup which thinks that everyone who takes up Sanskrit is doing it a favour (reflected by the concessions given to students such as presenting / writing their thesis in a different language) has to gradually go away. We have to expect high standards of those who carry degrees.  

4\. On the technical side, it should be the policy of all universities to put up all their future theses on the internet in a searchable unicode format so as to be of use to all students of Sanskrit and prevent plagiarism. The same can be extended to the older theses.  

  
svasti,  

 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,  

 shrivathsa.
