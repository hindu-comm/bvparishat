\>If you say i am Indologist most people ask whats that?



--- Is it not natural? Among all the -ologies that the -ology-knowing Indians know, where is Indology? How many colleges, institutes and universities had/have departments of Indology?



Is it not a fact that thefield of Indology itself was by and for the western academia interested in Sanskrit-centric textualist understanding of India?



Before we ask traditional Sanskrit scholars students to connect their writings to the existing body of publications and then contribute to that body of knowledge arguing through the methodology of that body of knowledge, let us remember that that means asking them



1\. to read the entire literature published, to most extent, by the western researchers in a language and tone meant for a western audience



2\. tosay those things which are not said in that literature and more importantly



3\. to shift into theworldview, epistemology, ontology, eschatology etc. that govern their methodology.



Reading Indian journals either in English or Sanskrit and connecting to the published material in that is not enough. Connecting to and arguing with Abhinavagupta, Rupagoswami or Madhusudana Saraswati in their methodand proposing a new concept /theory within that body of knowledge is not enough.



On the one hand, Prof. Hauben asks his western colleagues



वयमौस्त्रेलियंगत्वा कंकंगुरुमुपास्महे ?





And we here ask the Gurus for whose upAsana persons like Prof. Hauben like to come to India,

to either fit themselves into the body/framework created by the enthusiasts studying them with reverence/ interest

or languish aszoo exhibits.



No offence meant.



Thanks.
