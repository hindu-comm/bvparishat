Thank you for posting SB views as already indicated by Prof Varakhedi lets move away from SB.  
  
We don't want to be emotional but want concentrate on Sanskrit! which can do well without emotional outbursts. A level comprehensive vision and an action plan as to what scholars can best do in the short, medium and long term for sanskrit is the focus.  
  

SB is doing a good job and let them continue. Beg your paradon for being repetitive, SB has a limited purpose is well known one may be able to speak a language well that does not make one a scholar. I can read write and speak in English and Sanskrit and Kannada that doesn't make a kannada or Sanskrit scholar Vidvan in the true sense who can teach and spread the very complex and challenging issues which different Shastras talk its depth and breath built over thousands of years.  
  

SB on another thread Please. More postings related to thread are welcome.
