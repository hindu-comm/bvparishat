I appreciate the comments! If we see, some good scientists are Vedic scholars, a few of them are members of this forum too. Modern exposure should be given to whoever interested from traditional stream. Can I submit that there may not be any immediate harm to the established gurukulas or *tols*. Vedic University, Tirupati has arranged a special session on Science and Sanskrit in the recently held national seminar. Let the traditional learning be in tact. No one can disturb it, as even some of the gurukulas or tols, are self reliant. The point is how to build the 'bridge' persons?  
  
Further, I wonder, how much we can improvise with regard to śāstric lore. May I recall the words of Jayanta Bhatta - कुतो वा नूतनं वस्तु वयमुत्प्रेक्षुतुं क्षमाः । वचो विन्सायवैचित्र्यमात्रमत्रावधार्यताम् । Contemporary relevance of Sanskrit means, it appears for me, if it is in context of agriculture, how far ancient kṛṣipaddhatis be helpful in yielding more agricultural output; if it is in context of medicine, how far ancient Indian medical concepts can be applied to rampant life style disorders; if it is in context of grammar, how far the Paninian aphorisms help a computer scientist with regard to machine translations and computational tools by training the machine, and so on and so forth.  
  

I totally agree with the views on western methodology and frame work in context of śāstric learning. Thanks to western scholars like Prof. Jan E.M. Houben, who cultivated serious interest in Sanskrit for the past many years.  
  

So far as the discussion goes, apparently it seems that there need to be two categories of Gurus.  
  

Regards
