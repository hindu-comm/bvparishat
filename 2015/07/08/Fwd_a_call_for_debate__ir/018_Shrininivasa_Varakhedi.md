Dear Scholars,

  

I followed this thread by reading the mails one by one keeping the points discussed here. Firstly I thank Dr. Prasad for his erudite summary and his stands on the points raised by ChamU Krishna Shastry (CKS). Other scholars selected ‘Spoken Sanskrit” for discussion. Though this is very important and debatable issue, i don’t think that that is the only agenda CKS proposes. As I once again read the article of CKS and the article written in Sanskrit (posted by me tonight as a separate thread), i found that the focus of the speech is “how to make Sanskrit relevant with its content” and “how to make sanskrit living”.

  

Noteworthy point made by S. Subrahmanya is that "To speak in samksritam, means learning to think in samskritam, enabling continuous practice, giving a way to internalize a worldview, this is the way to get insights when studying a text”. It is quite a good point to note. I am not saying that Speaking Sanskrit will suffice everything required. As all agree, it is FIRST STEP. No further debate is needed. "Speaking Sanskrit" does NOT mean that conversing the daily routines in Sanskrit. It is nothing but “putting ideas in Sanskrit” or “expressing ideas in Sanskrit”. In other words having control over the language - ability to play with that language. I have seen many erudite people who can interpret the Shastric Sanskrit Language, but can not reproduce or express the idea in that language independently. It is simply because we are trained to understand the language and not to use the language. This is what our concern.

  

I have taken valid points from the both sides. Prof. Jha made a very good point that application of knowledge is very essential. This point is seconded by Prof. Deshapande. They don’t belittle the usage of Sanskrit in pedagogy or in any other form. But their concern is the content part of it. For me both - content and form carry equal importance. This debate is an ongoing debate. If we plunge into this, we never reach the shore.

  

I would once again draw the attention of the scholars to the core point made by CKS - “OUT OF BOX”. This is not happening. We are more concern about the number of students, conventional PhDs, courses, Jobs for Sanskritists. I am not saying that these are not important. But these are not the issues for a debate in an international asthanam. We should think about the future of Sanskrit, which is beyond the current problems that we are facing. There are people who will take care of this. Policy makers should really think “out of Box”.

  

Sanskrit Universities can do wonders if we stop worrying about funding and Govt policies. I request the scholars to write something on “Out of Box thinking”.

  

I just quote “This is the time to debate on the immediate steps and long term action plan to be taken for the restructuring of Samskrit Education” and "we have to think differently, going out of the box. Why don’t we think beyond 2025 and start preparing today for the post 2025 scenario?”

  

with warm regards,

shrivarakhedi
