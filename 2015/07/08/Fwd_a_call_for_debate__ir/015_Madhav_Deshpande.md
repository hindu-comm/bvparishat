I hope that the authorities in India planning for the future of Sanskrit studies heed the sage advice given by Professor V. N. Jha, and not limit on the idea of promoting spoken Sanskrit as the ultimate goal of learning Sanskrit. The modern spoken Sanskrit promoted by Samskrita Bharati is a lot of fun, and indeed has a place in the total scheme of Sanskrit learning, it is no more than a first step on the ladder to learn Sanskrit in depth. Without that depth and intensity, all the Shastras in Sanskrit will remain out of reach, and the limited teaching of elementary Sanskrit will serve little practical purpose.
