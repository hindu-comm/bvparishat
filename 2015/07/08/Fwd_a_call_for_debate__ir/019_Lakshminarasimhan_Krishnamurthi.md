At the outset let me beg your pardon for deviating from the interesting thread topic “New Impetus to Samskrit Education” posted by Prof. Varkhedi ji. I am looking forward to many more posts on this as I am on probation in this field.

I quote Prof Jha, in crisply defining the Goal and The Path;
“….Encourage the learners to getthoroughacquaintance with the traditional systems of knowledge; provide exposure to the parallel modern knowledge domains and contemporary discourses and ask them to think deep, compare and contrast, in order to identify the areas of application of those classical knowledge systems today. ……..But where are the teachers to motivate the students in this way ? Hence, we need to create such teachers first in both the streams : traditional as well as modern.”

Shri Chamu Krishna Shastry’s action points from his presentation are ; Samskrit Pedagogy, Teaching Samskrit thorough Samskrit, keeping the language simple, correcting the inverted supply funnel (diminishing supply from schools and increasing the number of universities), Teacher Training.Is there a discord between his analysis and others? No. It is a perfect match.

I am writing this with utmost respect to all the scholars. Few comments about Spoken Sanskrit, which is synonymous with Samskrita Bharati (SB) have come, like, “*Such programmes have very limited purpose; ..it is no more than a first step…; ….Teachers & students can speak well in Sanskrit that doesn't indicate they know Sanskrit well….”* etc.,). Dissonance with SB is clear in these observations.

I am an active volunteer of SB, participating, observing it from close for the past 25 years, wondering how it is transforming the lives of many men and women silently. As one of the many part-time contributors for its IT & \`other than Samskrit’ related work, I venture to submit the following;

1.SB, also tells - Spoken Sanskrit is the first step. Often heard slogans at SB are “sambhAshanatah shAstraparyantam”, “shAstra-samrakshanam and jeevana-samvardhanam”. The ultimate goal of SB is “dharma-samsthApanam”.

2.For SB, Sambhashana Shibir is just for awareness, building confidence and giving the taste of this Amrit to build the workforce for Samskrit. It provides avenues for each one to contribute/experiment in their own way. ( In my case, as I did schooling in Tamil Nadu, neither Samskrit nor Hindi is taught, thanks to SB, people like me could study Samskrit).

3. Apart from Spoken Sanskrit classes, SB has a few dozen activities exclusively for Samskrit literature and shAstrAs. ‘Samskrit through Correspondence’ scheme (which is as old as Speak Samskrit Movement) teaches Samskrit though Grammar based Approach. At present, there are 35,000 students studying through 12 Indian Languages. Another course
in good demand is, \`Samskrit through Bhagavadgita/Bhagavadgita through Samskrit ’, particularly 3^(rd), 4th and 5^(th) volumes. Not just the college students studying Samskrit flock to VyAkarana-shibiram, Sandhi-shibiram, SamAsa-shibiram, Tarka-sangraha-shibiram, nyAya-paricaya-shibiram, kAvya-rasAsvAda-shibiram, Raghuvamsha-shibiram, vedAnta-shibiarams but men & women of all age groups and backgrounds participate. Participants often range from 15 years to 80 years of age.

4. SB conducts ShalAka pariksha every year for vyakaraNa students and nyaya students and also for kAvya students. SB also provides lakhs of rupees every year as scholarships for shAstra students.

5. SB has published DVDs of Pandit Devadatta Patil’s lessons on Tarka Sangraha. He is one of the greatest teachers who has produced hundreds of Devadatta Patils! Yes!, Pandit Devadatta Patil is not the product of SB, but SB works closely with him. So many such scholars of different ShAstras are conducting ShAstra classes for SB.

6. SB has published around three hundred titles, almost touching every walk of life. I strongly feel this one aspect is worth serious evaluation by scholars, as the contributors range from established scholars like Prof. Kutumba Shastry, Prof. Pushpa Dixit... to those who have learnt Samskrit through SB. I have not seen other publishers having the vision and courage to publish contemporary topics like SB.

7. Greatest Samskrit scholars of today like Pujya Sringeri Shankaracharya, Pujya Pejavara Swamiji, Sri Ramanuja Tatacharya, Sri Mani Dravida Shastri, Sri K V Ramakrishnamacharya, Sri Haridasa Bhatta, Sri Vasishtha Tripati, Sri Kutumba Shastri Sri Rajarama Shukla etc are fully supporting the programs of SB. 

8. As I understand SB has come a long way and it has got a vision for next few decades, which is in complete agreement with the views expressed by the scholars in this forum.

9. SB needs the support of the scholars and the scholars are happy only with studious, serious and passionate students. In my opinion, SB’s contribution to attract the best brains from non-traditional background isphenomenal.

  

Lastly, I do not want to mistake passion and inspiration for ‘emotion’, while I agree that emotion should not be allowed to overpower rationality. Without passion and inspiration no tapas can be performed. Creating a movement and sustaining it demands great drive. While welcoming all the suggestions and criticism made in this forum, my humble and only prayer is that let us please not kill the drive!
