I am not saying nothing needs to be done about Aurveda all is perfect with Aurveda There are several such medical systems Unani, chinese sytems etc. Such sytems will have more students if more doctors are interested in traditional systems. Since this has go to do with human life one cannot take chances and get carried away. What charka and others have said has historic and cultural value but its application in modern day complicated medical environment will be limited that my view. That does not mean it should be neglected definitely more research and documentation is in needed. This can be one area of interdisciplinary study there is no doubt.  

Has UGC prevented Aurvedic research in universities? I think not
