Respected Sir!! Why all you pundit people are hell bent in undermining Rajiv Malhotra Sir? Before taking all the issues that have been raised against him, why can't you people see the effort he's putting on to instill pride about our nation and our culture in the minds of the common Indian that has been lost long ago and the main reason why Our Bhaarat is in its current state of low. And those who are leading this tirade have never been known to do atleast a fraction of the work Rajiv Sir is doing in reinstating the pride. Its just become the case of sour grapes. These people cannot reach the level of Rajiv sir and the fame he is gathering has thrown these cunning foxes out of sense. Whatever the issue regarding the plagiarism turns to become, we must sincerely commend his work for the positive influence it is generating and not dismiss him and his works for a silly reason. Because, the need of the hour is taking pride our culture and not looking at the loopholes of those who are doing it.
