Sri Rajiv Malhotra's actual words on Sanskrit quotation marksare these :



> 
> > The second level is whether there is omission of references in a > merely *technical* sense. This is where customs for acknowledgment > differ, depending on whether it is an academic book (which mine are > not), which readership is viewing it, and so forth. I wish to point > out that in ancient Indian traditions, references were required (as in > ancient Sanskrit texts) but the Western conventions did *not* apply. > Sanskrit does not even have quotation marks in its character set. Yet > traditional scholars made clear when they referred to someone else’s > thoughts. So in the worst case, I might be accused of violating a > *specific* technical convention of the style and form of acknowledging > sources. But certainly no plagiarism can be said at the level of the > intention and spirit of my work.
> > 

He did say in this paragraph :



> 
> > "Yet traditional scholars made clear when they referred to someone > else’s thoughts." >
> 

Yet, there are discussions on how Sri Rajiv Malhotra did notknow that there are tools such as 'iti' to quote other people's works.



More importantly this first sentence ofa two sentence combination :



> 
> > Sanskrit does not even have quotation marks in its character set. Yet > traditional scholars made clear when they referred to someone else’s > thoughts.
> > 

is separated as an independent sentenceand is publicised virally ashis justification andhis only justificationfor his alleged plagiarism and articles after articles posts after posts discuss whether Sanskrit not having quotation marks can justify his action or not, whether it is true that there are no tools of quoting in Sanskrit and so on.



In the Hindu, there was a news article highlighting only this sentenceseparated unjustifiably from its joint nextsentence as the justification and only justification by Sri Malhotra and advising him to apologise for his plagiarism.



But the fact is that it is neither used as a justificationless the only justification.



In this paragraph, his justification-sentence is 



> 
> > "So in the worst case, I might be accused of violating a *specific* > technical convention of the style and form of acknowledging sources. > But certainly no plagiarism can be said at the level of the intention > and spirit of my work."
> > 

Able to see the mischief?
