Mode Note  

This note is specifically with Mr. Tanthri's posting. Emotional outbursts are not welcome. When did Rajiv Malhotra become ' Sir' I don't think he has been Knighted. Members of Indology list who have made ad-hominem remarks are alsoscholars. Lets read both side of the argument and then arrive at conclusion. Prof Pandurangi in another thread has already clarified why cross posting for this issue was allowed. Nityanad Mishraji has already well articulated why we need to support Rajiv Malhotra . I have immense pride in my culture and Sanskrit has a glorious future with or without controversies. If there are controversies which is but natural the best course of action is to do, what Prof Paturi trying to do balance views of both the camps so that one can arrive at the right conclusion. If there are hidden agenda beyond intellectual controversies even that need to be resolved at a different level. Thanks
