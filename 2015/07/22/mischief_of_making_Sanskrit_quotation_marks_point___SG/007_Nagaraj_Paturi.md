Rohitha Tanthriji,



What is this 'you people' in your sentence



\>Before taking all the issues that have been raised against him, why can't you people see the effort he's putting on to instill pride about \>our nation and our culture in the minds of the common Indian that has been lost long ago and the main reason why Our Bhaarat is in \>Its current state of low.



You seem to be interested in expressing your intense admiration for Sri Rajiv Malhotra and appear to be taking the opportunity that was not provided by this thread. Though your words do not suit the context of the present thread, I appreciate your happiness with Sri Rajiv Malhotra's works.



But 'we people' are not doing anything that comes in the way of his work.



This thread is, in fact,about how his words are misquoted and thenunfairlyhighlightedoverlooking all other points made by him in the article.



So no opportunity for your worry here. Your words do not belong here.



Regards,
