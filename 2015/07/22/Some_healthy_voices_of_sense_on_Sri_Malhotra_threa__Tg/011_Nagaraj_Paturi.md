"Plagiarism is not new I don't remember the exact verses may be Bhamaha or Anandavardhana talks obout plagiarism. Among ancient and medieval writers there another interesting trend to write a work and ascribe it to some one else who is more famous may be it can be called reverse plagiarism."



is not connected my



Interestingly, it is the traditional Sanskrit training that infuses a natural sensitivity to what the modern system calls plagiarism. A traditionally trained Sanskrit student gets accustomed to speaking every sentence of him with a reference.



I was highlighting the habit of traditionally trained Sanskrit scholars *of our times* (probably inherited from centuries old culture of such traditional training) to quote a verse or a sentence from a source such as a bhAshya for every sentence in their lecture, sometimes even informal talks.



The issue of ancient and medieval writers projecting some other person as the author of their creative work is not connected to this at all. Interpolationsof one's own composition into the compositions of other authors also belongs to this category..This is an intriguing psychological tendency. This probably can be compared to incidents in whichone or both of the parents make their child grow as the child of
rich and prestigious parents themselves remaining anonymous. They probably seek pleasure inwatching their child grow with a prestigious name tagged. If the child is capable ofsustaining or multiplying the prestige of the family in which it is landed, it is not harmful to that family. But if thechild grows into a person whose actions damage the prestige of the family, then it is harmful to the matrix family into which the child is embedded. Such harms have been caused to some ancient and medieval authors of repute by these interpolating authors and authors projecting some other person as the author of their creative work.



But plagiarism is stealing. Claimingthe writing of other person's work as one's own.
