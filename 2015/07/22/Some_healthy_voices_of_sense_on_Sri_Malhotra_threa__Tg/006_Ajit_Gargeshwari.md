Plagiarism is not new I don't remember the exact verses may be Bhamaha or Anandavardhana talks obout plagiarism. Among ancient and medieval writers there another interesting trend to write a work and ascribe it to some one else who is more famous may be it can be called reverse plagiarism.

  
  
"If you found such dissertation drafts in Sanskrit research degree works , there is a great probability that they are products of such a bad/poor training at school and college level."  
  

This is one reason another reason might be the guide or the professor himself or herself may not be well read or they might want to push the concept of 2 year doctorate concept.  
  

How should this problem be resolved a solution has been proposed i agree that schooling and educational methodology needs a change at grass root level. I don't see on any Indian University website the universities policy on plagiarism and how its handled and what steps they are taking to prevent such unhealthy and unethical practices.
