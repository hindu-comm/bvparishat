Speaking of balance, even during another similar sidetracked discussion on the response ofDilip K. Chakrabarti, emeritus professor of South Asian archaeology with Cambridge University and a member ofICHR and its research project committee about one of the proposals from Delhi University's Sanskrit department, headed by Ramesh C. Bhardwaj to establish the chronology of texts such as the Rig Veda, Yajur Veda, Atharva Veda, Brahman Granth and the Upanishads, quite a fewconfronted those who were sidetracking.



The newspaper report posting of which triggered the whole AIT vs OIT debate, clearlyquotes Prof. Bhardwaj's words stating that disproving AIT was not the main objective of their proposed project.



Excerpt from the news report:

> > 
> > 
> > 
> > "We are trying to prove the chronology of the Sanskrit texts. By doing > that, if the Aryan immigration theory is destroyed, that is an > additional benefit," Bhardwaj argued.
> > 



The report itself mentions :

> C.I. Issac, a member of the council and the research project > committee, supported the Sanskrit department's proposal. "It is a > necessary endeavour without which we cannot understand our past and > move further," he said in an email. >
> "How can we move ahead without knowing our yesteryears? So I extended > my sincere support for this cause."

The report does not mention that Prof. Dilip K. Chakrabarti responded to the proposal directly. The newspaper sends a query to Prof. Chakrabarti and then he responds.

excerpt from the report:

> "The Sanskrit department of Delhi University would do a much better > job training some palaeographers and epigraphists, who will soon be an > extinct class of scholars in the country, without bothering about > something as racist and historically puerile as Aryans," Chakrabarti > said in an email to a query from **The Telegraph**.

When and how did the "Aryans" thing enter into the discussion, when Prof. Bhardwaj clearly says that thatis not the main objective?



When a link was provided to this report beginning a new thread on this immediate first response was from Prof. Howard Resnick, asking how was the proposal racist.



Prof. Geoffrey Samuel tried to defend Prof. Chakrabarti and said:

>

Someone I am not able to trace back from the thread said that Prof. Chakrabarti himself was against AIT and/or AMT.



Later when there was an unnecessary mountain out of a molehill debate on titles like Prof. before first name, many western scholarsclarified that they did not take offense to such addressing and the whole discussion was unnecessary.



This is to show that there were always some upright western Indologists who did not hesitate to take a position different from the positions that appear to be against India or Hinduism.



P.S. : I request the list members not to sidetrack the thread into AIT vs OIT or any such issues. The focus here is "some healthy voices too".
