Response from Phil Goldberg, the author of the book American Veda was this:



> 
> > Al Collins’ remarks are the wisest and most balanced I’ve read > regarding the Malhotra plagiarism business. I am not qualified to > judge whether Rajiv actually plagiarized, but as a professional writer > I am inclined to give him the benefit of the doubt. As Al suggests, > there are many reasons why an author might unintentionally reproduced > sections of other works without proper attribution. Research, > note-taking, cutting-and-pasting – it’s all messy, and mistakes happen > to the best and most experienced writers. A paragraph of my own was > used verbatim in a book, and the author was mortified when I brought > it to her attention. For all I know, I’ve done it myself, even though > I try to be meticulous about such things.
> > That said, there is a certain irony in the situation. Over the years, > Rajiv has aggressively accused many people of stealing from him. As > one of the accused, I can testify that it is very unpleasant and > frustrating. I told him more than once that the information he thinks > he revealed to me during my research on*American Veda*I had actually > known about 30 years before I ever heard of him or started writing the > book. Yet he never retracted his accusation. I find that sad. Rajiv > is doing important work, and he would have many more allies had he > been less combative.

Response from Prof. Jeffrey D. Long was this:

> Dear Friends,

> I would like to express my appreciation for the message that Al > Collins shared with the group earlier today regarding the Rajiv > Malhotra affair. It is extremely frustrating, as a scholar who is > sympathetic to many of Malhotra’s claims and positions, but who also > finds these claims frequently overblown and framed in an > unproductively antagonistic way, to be operating in the polarized > environment that has been created and sustained by people on both > ‘sides’ of the discussion. Carving out and sustaining a reasonable > ‘middle path’ in such a situation is quite difficult indeed.  
>   
> So, thank you Al! In the faith that this, too, shall pass, Jeff
