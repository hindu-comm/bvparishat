The verses in Dhvanyaloka come as part of a discussion on independent aatma for a literary work which is in samvaada (saadris'ya, similarity) with another literary work.



Aanandavardhanaachaaryaah says that such a similarity happens,( just usual, just natural, nothing to be surprised about).



संवादास्तु भवन्त्येव बाहुल्येन सुमेधसाम्

........................................................ 4-11



the word भवन्त्येव is worth noting.



The verses quoted by Prof. Kulkarni come next to this verse.



In these verses Achaaryaah classifies the happening similarities into three kinds:



1\. similarity between object and its mirror image



2\. similarity between object and its representation in a painting (photograph in modern parlance )



3\. similarity between a person andthat person'slook alike



Since the book is centred around the thesis ध्वनिरात्मा काव्यस्य, he says #1 and #2 when they happen, should be discarded because they are being compared to mirror image or a representational painting only because they do not have an aatma i.e. dhvaniof their own. #1 appears to have an aatma,dhvani but that is not its own. #2 does not have an aatma, dhvaniat all. #3 when happens , need not be discarded because it has not only an aatma, dhvanibut an aatma, dhvani of its own.



He says, sahridayas do not get repelled from #3 because they enjoy the dhvani of its own and relish it and admire it for the relish it gives.



plagiarism is something that is done, not something that happens. It is being discussed in the context of non-literary works, whereas the verses here discuss literary works.
