With regard to the plagiarism rules in the western universities let us remember :



1\. The intense care including rule framing, developing a no plagiarism declaration form etc. are new developments in the western universities too. These developments began in response to observations of a growing tendency of plagiarism. For example[this](http://www.google.co.in/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&frm=1&source=web&cd=2&ved=0CCUQFjABahUKEwjr9d_p3fLGAhUEvRQKHWJyAJo&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lancaster.ac.uk%2Fstaff%2Fgyaccp%2Fcaeh_28_5_02lores.pdf&ei=j6SxVavyA4T6UuLkgdAJ&usg=AFQjCNGSPlTh08llyPcrC78R4vS8AyOEUg&sig2=GsVlJ8IdUKsPsmsKzql3MQ)pdf has data onstudies on such tendencies.



2\. Most of the western universities have undergraduate programs as part of their structure (not in an affiliated form that we have in India). These measures to controlplagiarism are targeting the UG students.



3. These measures became necessary with increasingcomponents of term papers, assignments, project works in the student evaluation.



4\. Research degree level plagiarism has been very rare in the western universities due to extremely rigorous research degree procedures there. In india, particularly in Social Sciences and Humanities, such a rigor is neglected at research degree level in most places.



5. With increasingcomponents of term papers, assignments, project works in the student evaluation at UG level in India, the plagiarism control should start at the UG College level itself.
