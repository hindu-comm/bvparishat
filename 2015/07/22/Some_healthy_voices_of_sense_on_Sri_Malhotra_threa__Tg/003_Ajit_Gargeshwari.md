One of the most important issues that has come out in this controversy is plagiarism. The idea remains problematic with unclear definitions and unclear rules says wiki. What are the guide lines adopted by Indian Universities to prevent it in Sanskrit and Indological related thesis submitted by various students. Are students and researchers sensitized on this issues is question I am asking. Many Sanskrit thesis have cut an paste insertions from old Sanskrit Journals without acknowledging the source.  
  
Plagiarism can be a violation of [copyright](http://www.yourdictionary.com/copyright) laws and can be considered cheating, resulting in you getting a failing grade or even being kicked out of school. Says your [dictionary.com](http://dictionary.com) Has strict enforcement been done in Indian universities and by Indian authors especially those who writein areas of Indian culture Sanskrit History etc where it can go unnoticed than in a scientific article.
