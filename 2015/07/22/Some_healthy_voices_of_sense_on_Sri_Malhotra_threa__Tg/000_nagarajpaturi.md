Though the mountain out of a molehead thread(s) on Sri Malhotra's book havemany impoliteexpressions, it should be noted that some were bold enough to stand up and find fault with this whole unnecessary hue and cry.



An example is this excerpt froma post by Prof. Howard Resnick :



>

A thorough, dispassionate analysis of the Malhotra > phenomenon would include a scholarly, disapassionate examination of > the attitudes and assumptions of Indology toward objects, processes, > and events held sacred by lots of people. >

> > Lest some misunderstand, I gratefully acknowledge the enormous and > invaluable contribution of Indology to our understanding of South > Asian religions and cultures. Yet the most impressive enterprises > should remain open to self-critical introspection. >

Even Prof. Al Collinsfound fault with the whole discussion in a few long posts. Though he was rightly confronted by Prof. Aklujkar for making use of a typographical error in his post for a pun, excerpts from his posts such as the following may be noted:

Even Prof. Walter Joseph clearly stated :
