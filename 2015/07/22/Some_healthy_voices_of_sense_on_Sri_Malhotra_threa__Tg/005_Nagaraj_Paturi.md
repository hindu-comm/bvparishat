Are students and researchers sensitized on this issues is question I am asking.

Interestingly, it is the traditional Sanskrit training that infuses a natural sensitivity to what the modern system calls plagiarism. A traditionally trained Sanskrit student gets accustomed to speaking every sentence of him with a reference.

  

Ironically it is the system which is called the modern school and college education in India which is hanging in a tris'anku svarga without giving either the critical thinking ability and referencing and source-acknowledging habit of the counterpart western youngstersor the tarkanishTha of the traditionally trained Sanskrit vidyArthi,to its participant students.

  

As a result teachers and research guides at the university level are having to put huge efforts to infuse in the products of this tris'anku system the spirit behind giving references or acknowledging sources etc. Poor these youngsters get surprised when they are told that adopting
words of others into their writing without acknowledging the source of those words is considered to be stealing and the name given to it is plagiarism.

  

If you found such dissertation drafts in Sanskrit research degree works , there is a great probability that they are products of such a bad/poor training at school and college level. I consider these youngsters not to be culprits but victims of a poor training in critical thinking at school and college levels. With this training, they are doing the same in whichever field they are pursuing research degrees, not only in Sanskrit.

  

Urgently this problem needs to be addressed and resolved.
