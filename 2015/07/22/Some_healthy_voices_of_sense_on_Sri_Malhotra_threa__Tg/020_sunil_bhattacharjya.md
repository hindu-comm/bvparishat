Namaste,  
  
Coming to Abhinavagupta, his Paramarthasara is a modified copy of the Paramarthasara (or Aryapanchaasheeti) of Adishesha, who is believed to be Patanjali. Nobody raises any question of plagiarization in this case. From this it may mean that in the past, one with noble intention could reproduce other's works, either as it is, or with modifications, and that too without raising eyebrows.  
  

Regards,
