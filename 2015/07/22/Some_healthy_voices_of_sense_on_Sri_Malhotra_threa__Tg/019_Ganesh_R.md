VidvdbhyO namaH,

One can also refer to raajashEhlkhara's kaavyameemaamsaa (the chapter onharaNa) and kShEmEndra's kavikanThaabharaNa (verses like pad0pajeevee caraNOpajeevee chaayOpajeevee bhuvanOpajeevee etc.,).  
Even the attitude of our past masters like mallinaatha (on the commentary of meghadutam) abhinavagupta( in abhinavabhaarati) and arjunavarmadEva (in his commentary on amarukashataka ) on interpolation are worth noticing.  
All this is just sagauravam smaarayE, na tu shikShayE

Regards

Ganesh
