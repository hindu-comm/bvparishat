I do not know if the use of the word “trend” is justified. In any case, when there seems to be a reason to doubt someone’s authorship the evidence should be carefully examined, and a conclusion should be arrived at, not on the basis of one’s general impressions or views of a specific person or group, but, as far as possible, on the basis of objective evidence available in individual cases. A good historian should be prepared to shake off the weight of earlier Indological scholarship, and a clear, uncontested statement in traditional sources should not be lightly set aside. My experience so far indicates that traditional India had a much better sense of history than modern scholarship tends to assign to it.
