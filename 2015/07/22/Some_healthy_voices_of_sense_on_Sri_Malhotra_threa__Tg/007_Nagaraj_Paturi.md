This blog has this information:



In October of last year, the University Grants Commission (UGC) in India [proposed new regulations for the awarding of MPhil/PhD degrees in the country](http://ibnlive.in.com/news/mandatory-software-to-detect-phd-plagiarism/297432-60-118.html). Among the requirements were that all schools must begin “using well-developed software” to detect plagiarism and other forms of “academic theft” and also provide an electronic copy to the UGC for inclusion in the organization’s Information and Library Network Centre ([INFLIBNET](http://www.inflibnet.ac.in/ "INFLIBNET")), which is open to the public.
