Namaste,  
  

Shri Ajitji has pointed out an important point. There is no doubt that
the overall intention of the author is the most important factor to be looked at in any work. Yet, one cannot ignore the ways the author expresses his or her view-point as well as the ways the author acknowledges the existing and earlier literary works by giving adequate references. As Swami Vivekananda had told us that we should not hesitate to accept what is good in the western ways, I believe that quoting references profusely the western way should be encouraged, as that is not at all detrimental to the present-day Indological works.  
  

Regards,
