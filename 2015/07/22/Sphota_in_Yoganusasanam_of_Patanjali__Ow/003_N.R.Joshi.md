Dear Prof S. Korada, Saadara PraNaam,



You mentioned, " theअ in अ इ उ ण् denotes 18 अकारs". Please pardon me for my ignorance in asking this question. What is meant by 18 अकारs ? Does this mean the vowel अ has 18 varieties or something else? Please help mein removing my ignorance. I know it comes in Mahabhasya. Beyond that no further understanding. Thanks. NRJOSHI
