Dear Prof S. Korada, Saadara PraNaam.



Many thanks for taking time to explain the verse in Yognusasana of Patanjali. I do not belong to any

Sampradaaya. I am not devoted to the theory of any ancient or modern Sanskrit aachaaryas. I am a researcher.



Not all people are fortunate to have education from a Guru described by you. (In one way you are like ONline Guru to many of us members of BVP).



My other gurus are books written by you, K. K. Raja, Kapil Kapoor, S. D. Joshi, Gaurinath Shastri, Bimal Matilal, K. Raghavendra Pillai (Vaakyapadeeya), M. Deshpande, A. Aklujkara and of many other well known scholars.



I am Sanskrit Premee (appreciating the ancient language of Hindu scriptures). Because my background in the science of sound I was attracted to VarNavaada. Sphotavaada has its merit and I aknowledge that.



I have no intention to belittle the works of the ancient aacharyaas like Patanjali, Panini etc.



I am aware that scholars differ on the origin of human languages including Sanskrit. But then different vyaktis, different prakritis. Thanks again. N. R. Joshi
