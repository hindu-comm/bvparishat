Though this is not related to the issue of identification of 'Dravidian languages' as a separate group than Sanskrit-Prakrit, since the general classification of languages is also the issue taken up for discussion here, let me bring up the point that treating Sanskrit and Prakritas as different languages is artificial.

  

While talking to younger students, I found the following aspects of misinformation spread among them:

  

1\. There is a language called Prakrita. --- Whereas the fact is that (1) Prakrita stands for the non-standard variety of Sanskrit speech and in its singular number usage, the word refers to the whole category of what are called Prakritas, in its plural form it refers to the individual members of that category (2) There is no single language called Prakrita

  

2\. Pali is a different language than Prakrita- this impression seems to have been created through the discussions on history of Asoka's times and Asoka's use of Pali

  

Are different dialects of Kannada or Telugu and the standard form of Kannada or Telugu (I am confident that list members are aware of the value-free use of the word standard language in modern linguistics) treated as separate languages? Are there two separate departments in universities for standard Telugu and non-standard dialects of Telugu ? But this has been artificially happening in the case of Sanskrit. the standard form called Sanskrit and the non-standard forms called Prakritas. There are separate departments in universities for the standard form called Sanskrit and the non-standard forms called Prakritas.
