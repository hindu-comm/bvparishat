Vidushee Malti Auckle,



You said:



"we are also not convinced about the fact that Sanskrit is THE FIRST LANGUAGE or among the first languages"



The word 'first language' has a specific connotation in linguistics.



It is contrasted with 'second language'



In this sense, the word 'first language' is used to mean 'native tongue' of a speaker.



It appears that you are using the word in the sense of origin language. Perhaps you want to say , "we are also not convinced about the fact that Sanskrit is THEORIGIN LANGUAGE or among theorigin languages"(of all Indian languages).
