Dear friends,  
  
It seems there are claims that the Dravidians originally lived in the Sindhu-Saraswati region. Later on they could have migrated from there and that could be due to the drying up of the Saraswati river. There have been the Brahui Dravidians in Baluchistan and Afghaniastan belonging to the same ancient Dravidian stock.
