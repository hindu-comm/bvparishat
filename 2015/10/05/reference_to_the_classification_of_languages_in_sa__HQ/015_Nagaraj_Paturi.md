1\. Naiyaayika view does not support 'paurushEyatva' in the sense of human authorship including rishi-authorship of the Vedas.



2\. 'Isvarakrita ' in fact is in contradiction with or in opposition tohuman authorship including rishi-authorship. (Interesting anology in Marxist theoryis -- abolishing individual property is achieved through the nationalization or government taking over of all means of production and distribution. Isvarais the 'non-individual'entity)



3\. Everyone who calls the Vedas the s'ruti is in opposition to
'paurushEyatva' in the sense of human authorship including rishi-authorship of the Vedas.
