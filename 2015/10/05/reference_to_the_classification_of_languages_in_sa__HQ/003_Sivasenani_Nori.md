The earliest reference to a Dravidian language in Sanskrit literature that I know is in the MlecchaprasiddhapraamaaNyaadhikaraNam (consisting of one soota 1.3.10) in Tantravartikam by Kumarila, where he refers to a few Dravidian words. I am attaching the adhikaraNam for your ready reference. Please see the prose part in the third page.
