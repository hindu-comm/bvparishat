Dear Dr. BVK Sastry,

  

  The doctrine of Apauruṣeyatva of the Vedas as proposed by the Mīmāṃsakas was in all probability a response to the Pauruṣeyatva of the Vedas argued by the Buddhists (cf. Tevijja-Sutta of Dīghanikāya of the Pali Tripitaka). The contestation by the Buddhists continued through the works of Nāgārjuna, Dharmakīrti, Bhāvaviveka, Śāntarakṣita and others till 1000 A.D. A student of mine is currently working on the Buddhist debate with the Mīmāṃsakas. Even among the Āstika schools, the Nyāya-Vaiśeṣikas argued for Pauruṣeyatva of the Vedas, with the Puruṣa being Īśvara, a position not acceptable to the Mīmāṃsakas. Even among schools that argue for the Nityatva, there are differences, some arguing for the Kūṭasthanityatā of the Vedas, while others being perfectly satisfied with Pravāhanityatā. So, it appears that this doctrine of Apauruṣeyatva, though obviously an important doctrine, was not universally accepted, and positively contested by Nāstika and Āstika schools. Bhartṛhari refers to both views, Nityatva and Kṛtakatva, and argues: nityatve kṛtakatve vā teṣām ādir na vidyate. It is not only the Buddhists who called the Ṛṣis as the authors of the Mantras (mantānaṃ kattāro isayo, in Tevijja-Sutta), but the same expression appears in Kālidāsa: apy agraṇīr mantrakṛtām ṛṣīṇām ... So, we have a long history of contestation on this issue before we reach the modern period. With best regards,
