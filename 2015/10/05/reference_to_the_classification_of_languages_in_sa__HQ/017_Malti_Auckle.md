Dear respected scholars,

I thank you for taking up this issue. Members of the Indian diaspora are still linked with their past and so have still involved themselves in the study of Sanskrit and have been facing the problem determining the source of Indian languages and we are also not convinced about the fact that Sanskrit is THE FIRST LANGUAGE or among the first languages .

I have a humble request to respected administrator.

Sir, is there the possibility to collect all the threads of this eye opening discussion under one article with references? This will help us who do not have the opportunity to attend workshops and seminars regarding this burning issue. It will help us enormously. We can learn the right thing. List of books of references already existing will be of great help  

  

Thank you.

Malti
