Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



To the best of my knowledge Mlecchas were located on the west of Aryas, somewhere on the ancient border landof modern day Pakistan and Afghanistan. They were related to Aryas. If the word Dravidian meant south Indian languages, then it has nothing to do with Mleccha language. I may be corrected if my understanding is faulty. Thanks. N.R.Joshi

The earliest reference to a Dravidian language in Sanskrit literature that I know is in the MlecchaprasiddhapraamaaNyaadhikaraNam (consisting of one soota 1.3.10) in Tantravartikam by Kumarila, where he refers to a few Dravidian words. I am attaching the adhikaraNam for your ready reference. Please see the prose part in the third page.
