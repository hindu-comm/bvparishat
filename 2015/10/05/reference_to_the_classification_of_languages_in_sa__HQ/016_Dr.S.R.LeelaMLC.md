In this context , I request the scholars to discuss the term matrubhasha also. My studies point towards something like this---mathrubhasha is an alien concept to [Bharat.it](http://Bharat.it) is imported from
English, mother tounge.The most important ancient treatise on theatre involving dance ,music, languages and other aspects , the Natya shastra, does not mention matrubhasha , despite giving names of several samudaya bhashas.
