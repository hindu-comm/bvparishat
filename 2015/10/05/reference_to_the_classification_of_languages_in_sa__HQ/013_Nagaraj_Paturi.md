\> Even among the Āstika schools, the Nyāya-Vaiśeṣikas argued for Pauruṣeyatva of the Vedas, with the Puruṣa being Īśvara,



----- Is the word "'paurusheyatava' of the Vedas" used by Naiyayikas or is this an inference drawn from the theory of Is'vara's role in S'abda -artha sambandha?



\> a position not acceptable to the Mīmāṃsakas.



-------- Is the position that the Vedas are from Is'vara not acceptable to Mimamsakas?



\> Bhartṛhari refers to both views, Nityatva and Kṛtakatva, and argues: nityatve kṛtakatve vā teṣām ādir na vidyate



------ Is this about s'abdas or the Vedas



Is the theory of Rishi-role (as mantradrashTas)in the Vedas incompatible with the theory of apaurushEyatva of the Vedas?



To my understanding these two views are not mutually incompatible.



All aastikas believe in the role of Rishis as mantradrashTas of the different mantras of the Vedas.



Kalidasa's mantrakṛtām ṛṣīṇām needs to be viewed from this perspective only.
