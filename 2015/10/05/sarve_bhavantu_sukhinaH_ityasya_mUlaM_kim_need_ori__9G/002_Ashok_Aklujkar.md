To add to the important information passed on by Shri Hsti Pārṣada Dāsa, I will reproduce a note I made several years ago: " How old is sarve ‘tra sukhinaḥ santu.. ..? It is found in a corrupted but easily-recognizable-as-identical form in the colophon of a ms., dated 1464 saṁvat (= 1407 A.D.), of Uvaṭa’s commentary. Sarup 1929: Introduction p. 72.”  
  
Here by “Sarup 1929," I mean Sarup, Lakshman. 1929. Indices and Appendices to the Nirukta with an Introduction. Lahore: The University of the Panjab.  
  
So, सर्वेऽत्र सुखिन: सन्तु …is not later than 1407 A.D.  
  
a.a.
