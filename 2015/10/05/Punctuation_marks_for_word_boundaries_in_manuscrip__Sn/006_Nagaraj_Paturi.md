The image I am sharing here is of a copper plate of Telugu lyrics 1407 AD -1508 AD.

  

A single vertical line indicating paada end and two such lines indicating verse end.

  

Pallavi and Charanam are also marked through bracketing the words pallavi charanam between marks made of two vertical lines.

  

But word boundaries are not marked.
