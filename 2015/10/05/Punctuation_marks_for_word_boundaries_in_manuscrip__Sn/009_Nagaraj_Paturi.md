Numbering is there in the copper plate of Telugu lyrics of 15th century I shared.



Numbers are bracketed between 'double danda' marks, at the end of respective verses.



An interesting marking found here is a horizontal line between two double dandas. It appears to be similar to a big space between paragraphs.
