As for traditional Bengali, Devnagari, Oḍiya and Śāradā manuscripts, word ends were not shown. Pāda ends, ends of two pādas and verses were shown.

In prose usually a unit of description was shown by a single stroke. Long accounts were shown with two strokes. These were vaguely similar to sentence end and paragraph ends. Their determination seems to have partly depended on the scribe or the composer.

In the 19^(th) century there occurred a competition between traditional manuscript writers (*Vaiṣṇavīs*) and the emerging press. It is not impossible that some signs from modern printing style had found their way into manuscript writing at that time. But that did not cause significant change in the style at that time. Currently the modern traditional ashrams and gurukuls hardly use country paper and take to the style of the printed book.

Sorry for the long lecture
