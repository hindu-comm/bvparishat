Dear Prof. Bhat,

  

The specimens you have provided are very illustrative of the pains taken by the scribes to help users.

  

They illustrate at the same time, the efforts you have taken to provide the actual text contained therein, as not all can figure out the same easily.

  

A note on the date of the manuscripts, if possible, will further enhance the value of your efforts.

  

Regards

KSKannan
