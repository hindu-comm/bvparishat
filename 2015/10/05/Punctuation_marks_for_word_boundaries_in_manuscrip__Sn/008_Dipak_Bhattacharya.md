Thanks for the illuminative postings!

A page from the Śāradā ms (1619 AD)of the Paippalādasaṁhitā was reproduced by Whitney in his translation of the AV (2005).  

It occurs also in the Paippalādasaṁhitā Vol.3, Asiatic Society, Calcutta 2011, p.cxxviii and on the jacket. If a good scan is possible  

I shall share some pages from the said ms.

Best
