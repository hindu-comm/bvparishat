The verse in the space margin above has this verse of quoted in Vamana:

  

अस्पृष्टा दोषमात्राभिःसमग्रगुणगुम्फिता। विपञ्चीस्स्वरसौभाग्या वैदर्भी रीतिरिष्यते\|\| and some more explanation for प्रसत्ते ‍^ प्रसादाख्यगुणस्य‌^ र्यः पात्रं तिलकयति‍ ^तिलकं क....ति‍‍^यः,  above the first line of the verse.

  

This portion adds in the margin, the छाया in Sanskrit for the text of Prakrit passage above the line.

where the last word is copied as in Prakrit; भावो for भावो in Prakrit, which should be भावः as it is the last word in the Sentence. But it is not corrected. The second sentence the Sutradhara, the correction has bheen added above the letter : अन्यमु\<दु>पक्रान्तम्. The same followed through out this manuscript.
