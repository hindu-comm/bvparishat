Thanks for the specimen of devanagari manuscripts.

The function of danda delayed sentences mainly. The other numbering of the words are used for the अन्वय of the words in a verse and the interleniar space above each line is used to add gloss and the margin also used for the purpose. This is common practice in manuscripts
having gloss added. The word space is not provided at all n common with manuscripts in other scripts. The interleniar space and marginal space is used for adding the gloss and/or variants adding some marks or numbers just above or by the side of the word related to the gloss or variants or gloss. In many cases, there won't be any mark either but only we have to relate them by their order of sequence in the line to the left or right.

The same style of writing is used in शारदा script with notes, variant, gloss etc. But for the text only, there is separation with spaces or any other mark except दण्ड single or double as you can see in the images attached.
