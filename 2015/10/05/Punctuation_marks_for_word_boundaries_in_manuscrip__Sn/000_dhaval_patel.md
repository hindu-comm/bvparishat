Respected all,  

The current discussion on 'writing style' has time and again thrown an issue that the old manuscripts did not have any punctuation marks.  
  

My questions in this regard are:  

1\. What kind of punctuation marks are used across India for denoting word boundaries in old manuscripts?  

2\. Can we trace the oldest usage of such punctuation marks in manuscripts?  
  

My starting observations on these two points are based on one manuscript I had chance to work with.  

LD Institute of Indology acc. no. 38832  
  

An example line is attached herewith.

**Ans 1 -**  
There are punctuation marks in at least some manuscripts e.g. the present one.  
Mark 1 - Word boundaries are depicted by a '\|' like sign after the word.  

  
There are also some punctuation marks for hinting the correct split of sandhi e.g.  
Mark 2 - 'S\|' like mark below the word to denote that the Second member of split starts with 'A'. See the second arrow 'भव्याननतामरसेन...'.  
Mark 3 - 'S' like mark is used to denote that second member of split starts with 'a'. See 'ननतामरसेनया'.  

Mark 4 - avagraha like structure for 'o+a' depiction. See 'वोस्तु'.  

Mark 5 - same as mark 3. But here the split is 'a+a' whereas in mark 3 it was 'A+a'. I am not sure whether there is some difference in the punctuation marks or not.  

Mark 6 - ऊlike structure to denote that the second member of split has 'U'.  

Mark 7 - This mark shows that the next member starts with 'i' or 'I'. In present case it is 'a+I' split.  

Mark 8 - The mark is similar to mark 8. Here the split is 'i+i'.  
  

In addition to the above punctuation marks, the numbers on top of the words denote their avyaya. The words are to be parsed in that chronology to get the correct parsing.  
  
  

**Ans 2 -**  
  

Such versatile punctuation marks are already in existence from vikrama samvat 1574 i.e. 1518 AD roughly as can be seen from the colophon of this manuscript.

Other scholars may also share their experience with manuscripts in this regard. So that history of word boundary punctuation marks can be put in right perspective.
