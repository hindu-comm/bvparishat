The festival of Holī/Hoḷī or Holākā occurs in the month of Phālguna. In celebrating it, social hierarchies are disregarded in several parts of India (particularly northern India). Young persons gathering around a fire shout disrespectful (and sometimes even obscene) words regarding community elders, officials et al. (and, according to anthropologists, get the bottled up tensions, frustrations etc. out of their systems).

  

Such shouting, usually loud and sustained over several seconds/minutes and frequently containing nonsense syllables is called bomb(a) in Marathi.

  

There is a delightful essay on this by McKim Marriott in the collection:[When a great tradition modernizes ; an anthropological approach to Indian civilization](http://webcat1.library.ubc.ca/vwebv/holdingsInfo?searchId=370653&recCount=10&recPointer=4&bibId=1074886), edited by Milton Singer and first published in 1972,New York, Praeger,
republished in 1995 bythe University of Chicago Press. Probably available also as an ACLS \[= American Council of Learned Societies\] Humanities E-Book.

  

The first quarter of the verse should probably read ªमात्रेण. The intent of the author, who is probably relatively recent, seems to be:‘Because the Vedāntins in the age of Kali simply utter Vedāntic theses and are not able to act in accordance with them, they are like juveniles shouting at Holi.’

  

The Subhāṣita-ratna-bhāṇḍāgāra (p. 98, verses 5-6 under Kali-mahimā) also has कुशला: शब्द-वार्तायां वृत्ति-हीना: सुरागिण:. कलौ…Forसुरागिण:, recall the practice of painting faces and throwingcollaredwater on the bodies of participants that is observed in Holī.
