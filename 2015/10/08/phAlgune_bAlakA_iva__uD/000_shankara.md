Namaste,

  

I request learned members of this group to explain the meaning of 'फाल्गुने बालका इव'. The source of this verse is said to be a Smriti. I would also like to know the exact source of this verse.  

  
वागुच्चारोत्सवं मात्रं तत्क्रियां कर्तुमक्षमाः ।  
कलौ वेदान्तिनः सर्वे फाल्गुने बालका इव ॥



regards  
shankara
