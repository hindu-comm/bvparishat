Respected Scholars,  
  

One of my friends (Sri Seshatalpa Sayee [www.andhrabharati.com](http://www.andhrabharati.com)) has been in the search of Sabdaratnavali for a long time. Now he could get the entire kosha on line from [Scribd](https://www.scribd.com/doc/282957538/Sabda-Ratnavali-Asiatic-Society-Mathuresa). But a few pages - at least two pages in the index and the first page of kosha are missed in the scan. May I request you to help me locate the missing pages in this regard.  
  
For your kind information the kosha details are -   
Sabdarathnavali: An Early Seventeenth Century Kośa Work Compiled in the Name of Musa-Khan [*Issue 1591 of Bibliotheca Indica*](https://www.google.co.in/search?tbo=p&tbm=bks&q=bibliogroup:%22Bibliotheca+Indica%22&source=gbs_metadata_r&cad=2) Author[ Mathureśa ](https://www.google.co.in/search?tbo=p&tbm=bks&q=inauthor:%22Mathure%C5%9Ba%22&source=gbs_metadata_r&cad=2)Editor [Pandit Manindra Mohan Chaudhuri](https://www.google.co.in/search?tbo=p&tbm=bks&q=inauthor:%22Pandit+Manindra+Mohan+Chaudhuri%22&source=gbs_metadata_r&cad=2) Publisher The Asiatic Society, 1970 Length 322 pages  
  

I appreciate any help.  
  

Thanks and regards,  

Prasad
