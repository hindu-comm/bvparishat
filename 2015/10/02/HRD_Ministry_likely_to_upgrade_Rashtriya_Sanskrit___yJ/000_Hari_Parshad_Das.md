To encourage Sanskrit learning and promote research in the language, the HRD ministry is likely to make Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan on par with Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) and Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs).  
  
Sansthan is a recognised, deemed university recommended by the University Grants Commission. Upgrading it to the level of IITs and IIMs will mean enabling it to get direct funding from the Centre and allowing more autonomy to the institution.  
  
The Sansthan is based in New Delhi and has 11 centres across the country. To enable it to expand its network and give it more freedom for designing curriculum, the ministry is mulling over the idea of making it an autonomous body. Unlike the IITs and IIMs that work independently, the Sansthan has limited scope of expansion and operates under the aegis of the UGC.  
  
Union HRD minister Smriti Irani on Wednesday, while speaking at the convocation ceremony of the Sansthan, talked about encouraging research work in Sanskrit. Irani also spoke about making Sanskrit learning simpler and highlighted the need to link it to technology.  
  
Irani's proposal of encouraging research work in Sanskrit also comes at a time when the Second Sanskrit Commission has been submitted to the ministry. The commission, which was set up during the term of UPA-II, submitted its report last month.  
  
"To encourage Sanskrit learning, we need to revive the Sanskrit texts, expand the horizon of Sanskrit research and make it simpler for younger generations to accept the language," said a member of the commission.  
  
The commission is also learnt to have recommended the need to set up Sanskrit language sansthans on the lines of IITs and IIMs and All India Institute of Medical Science. "These autonomous bodies are encouraged to conduct research. They enjoy direct funding from the government of India. Setting up an autonomous body will bring more funds for research. It will boost the morale of Sanskrit scholars," added the member.  
  
The Sansthan was set up in 1970 on the recommendation of the first Sanskrit Commission. After the BJP came to power last year, the HRD ministry has been mooting the idea of upgrading the institution to an international university on the lines of Nalanda University.  
  
The HRD ministry is likely to table the Sanskrit Commission report in Parliament in the winter session.
