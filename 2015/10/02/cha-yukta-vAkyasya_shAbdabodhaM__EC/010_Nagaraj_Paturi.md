I found the following notebelow the verse कोन्वस्मिन्:



The meter filling words like *tu, hi ca, sma, ha, vai: paada puuraNe - amara kosha* do not usually mean anything and they fit-in as meter fillers, hence will be dropped in word-to-word meanings. But if they are used specifically, they play havoc in rendering meaning. Here the word *dharmaj\~na* is used, which means, 'knower of rightness...' but when coupled with *ca* it means 'also, the knower of wrongness... ' where the *ca* assumes the character of 'either...' and the use of numerous *ca*-s here in these questions of Valmiki, is to denote that every questioned merit plusses itself into one human being. We are showing all the *ca*-s and *tu*-s throughout, giving their meaning as 'also...' and they may be dropped, if need be, in the gist of verse.
