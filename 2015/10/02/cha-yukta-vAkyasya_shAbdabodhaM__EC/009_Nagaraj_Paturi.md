Dr Kulkarni,



Since your purpose relates to machine based processing, it may be a good idea to leave scope for छंदःपूरणार्थक 'च' also.



तु is another such पूरणार्थक usage found in verses.



In Telugu, there is an idiom, ' tu, cha, tappakunDaga' which means (he follows the words ) without even violating the तुs and चs .



The emphasis in the idiom is on the lack of necessity of following the तुs and चs , with the idea that the the तुs and चs could have been छंदःपूरणार्थक.



Regards,



Nagaraj
