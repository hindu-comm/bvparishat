I got this from the thread : wide acceptance of Yoga Vasistha and Astavakra Gita  
  

Krishna Kashyap wrote :

What do you mean by 'extreme form of Advaita' ?  

I'll like to hear from Krishna Kashyap.  

Is it just - the advaita philosophy which doesn't follow prakriyA of shA\~Nkara-s?  

Or, is it 'some illogical form of advaita forcing advaita in everyway, mostly impossible ones?
