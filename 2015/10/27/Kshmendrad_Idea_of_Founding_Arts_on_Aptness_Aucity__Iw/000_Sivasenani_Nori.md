Prof. Navjyoti Singh, Head, Centre for Exact Humanities, IIIT, Hyderabad would deliver the Gunturu Seshendra Sharma Memorial Lecture (Endowed by Smt. Indira Devi Dhanrajgir, W/o Sri Gunturu Seshendra Sharma) on "Kshemendra's Idea of Founding Arts on Aptness (Aucitya)" at Conference Hall, School of Humanities, University of Hyderabad at 3:00 pm on 28th October 2015, Wednesday. All are welcome.

  

**About the Speaker:** Prof. Navjyoti Singh, an alumnus of IIT, Kanpur has wide ranging interests, cutting across mathematics, linguistics, logic, philosophy, science and history. He presently heads the Centre for Exact Humanities in the International Institute for Information Technology, Hyderabad.

  

**About Kshemendra:** A poly-math from Kashmir who flourished in the 11th Century, he was a student of Abhinavagupta (amongst others). Kshemendrawrote on a wide range of subjects and in different genres. Nearly 35 of his works are known, about half of which are published (many are not available). Born into Saiva sampradaaya, Kshemendra became a Vaishnava later. In AlankaaraSaastra, he is considered the founder of the Aucitya school. Some feel that Aucitya need not be counted separately as a school and that it is only an elaboration of what Anandavardhana had expounded in Dhvanyaloka.

  

**About the book औचित्यविचारचर्चा** - In this short book 39 kaarikas are expounded with a vritti by the author himself. 27 types of aucitya are enumerated, with examples and counter-examples for each quoting great poets and the author himself. What is interesting is that counter-examples include verses of Mahakavis like Kalidasa and even the author, Kshemendra himself. In the work, aucitya is established as the "life of a kaavya" - औचित्यं रससिद्धस्य स्थिरं काव्यस्य जीवितम्" (3 cd). Without aucitya, Guna, Alankaaras etc. will not embellish the Kaavya, rather they would cause Rasabhanga. It is only Aucitya which makes other aspects work.

  

**About Sri Gunturu Seshendra Sharma (1949-2007)**: A poet-scholar-critic and bureaucrat (he last served as the Municipal Commissioner of Hyderabad), who was well versed in the ancient sciences, and who wholeheartedly embraced the modern times. Here was a student of Alankaarasaastra, who actually applied his scholarship in his poetry. He had a novel take on Naishadhiyacharita of Sri Harsha, expounded in his "Swarnahamsa". Similarly his "Shodasi", a critique of Ramayana discovers Kundalini in Ramayana. He has received the Central Sahitya Akademi award for his work "Kaalarekha" comprising of critical essays covering a wide range of subjects.
