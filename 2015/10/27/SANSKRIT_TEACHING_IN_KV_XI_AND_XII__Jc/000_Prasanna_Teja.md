I think there is a need for accelerating the significance of Sanskrit teaching in Higher secondary education by highlighting the applications of Sanskrit in Science ,Commerce and Arts especially in Kendriya Vidyalayas. As the experts says there is a need to think how to take Sanskrit in schools from the first or nursery standards.I think we should develop these constructive thoughts along with that we should also be aware of decisions taken by ministry of HRD in appointing PGT in Sanskrit as the Joint commissioner of Kendriya Vidyalaya had already decided to implement Sanskrit in KV in XIth and XIIth on 05/12/2014.As of now we cant find any progress in this idea through official website of KV. I have also raised this question to HRD minister and KV pragatisheel shikshak sangh and did not get any reply.I am expecting some of the Sanskrit experts to raise this issue and collect latest updates on this matter from concerned authority.I am attaching official decision taken by joint secretary of KV on 5/12/2014 regarding implementing Sanskrit teaching in KV in XIth and XIIth.
