Prizes make it attractive to children. Ramayana shloka competitions and rewards, is one way to reward the prizes.

Amarakosha, etc. are other examples to introduce competitions and prizes at early stage of childhood, which we think we should have studied when we were children. eventually vyakarana sutras & other sutras can be introduced at various levels of classes.

Thanks
