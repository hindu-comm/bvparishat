I am curious to know what  C-DAC is doing about this. They had many projects for several years on developing Indicfonts. Probably Sam Pitroda's can be briefed about that project. Google is market driven if they feel there is a market they will definitely sponsor for development of an Online Sanskrit dictionary and fonts. Comparing Latin to Sanskrit will not make a difference there have to be enough users for a tool or software to be developed. There are online Sanskrit dictionaries and fonts. We had a couple of threads in BVP on that.
