Dear Scholars!



I got this mail from a friend of mine.



This forum may deliberate on the issue.

I wanted to send you this link since Sam Pitroda's talk.  
<https://translate.google.co.in/> \[4\]  
It has 90+ languages including Latin but no Sanskrit.  
In case you meet someone who wants to do something  
for Sanskrit, could you suggest that they develop an online  
dictionary and fonts and try to make it available?
