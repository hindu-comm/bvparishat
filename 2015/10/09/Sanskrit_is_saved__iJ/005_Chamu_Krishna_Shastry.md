1\) I humbly request to everyone not to take my name and not to give credit to me, I am just another volunteer, please put complete full stop to giving credit and praising me, 'who did it' is not important, other 'Wh' questions are.  
2) If we are to learn any lessons from the German episode, last year when the the Govt did not sign and did not renew the contract to teach German, there was a hue and cry that German was removed, we the lovers of Sanskrit were not able to understand the issue and also were not able to genrate public support in favor of Sanskrit, our voice was not heard, hence let us prepare for a 'going to come' still bigger outburst. *There would be a greater churning and louder debate on language issues in the near future, Sanskrit language will be the only looser in the prevailing circumstances!*

3\) If you are interested in knowing some of the issues of importance and the task ahead of us, you may kindly read an article in the coming issue of Sambhashana Sandesha
