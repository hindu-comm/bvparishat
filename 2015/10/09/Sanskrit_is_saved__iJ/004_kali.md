HariH OM!

  

This is an encouraging news for all Samskrita Enthusiasts and lovers.

  

It it is true, MHRD and all officials of the ministry and Shri Chamu Krishna Shastri Mahodaya are to be congratulated for achieving this task.

  

Everyone knows howvehement wasthe opposition when Samskritam was made the third language in place of German in Kendriya Vidyalayas.

  

It is not the love of German *per se* but the hatred forthe Language of our vedas and Upanishads that prompted the

  

vested interests to raise hue and cry against Samskritam.

  

Chamu Krishna Shastry Mahodaya and Samskrita Bharati were in the forefront and started a signature campaign against

  

the replacement of Samskritam in Kendriya Vidayalas some three years back. The attackers on our language and culture were made to retreat then.

  

Asanother lover of Samskritam suggested on this topic, all states should incorporate this in their educational policy

  

to promote Samskritam from the First standard onwards in the schools and induct small children to learn the language at an early age.

  

Like the Bala Vihar classes Samskrita Bharatiand other spiritual organizations areconducting voluntarily for the children in schools, the school authorities themselves can

  

initiate this as part of their curricula. This should come from the Government initiatives.

  

Hopefully, wiser counsel will prevail in the minds of the powers that be at the state level for this meritorious initiative.

  

The authorities should be made to be aware ofmore than amillion manuscripts yet to be digitized which holds a treasure trove of knowledge.

  

If pursued in right earnest, this treasure trove will boost our Nation to glorious heights on the world scene which will see once again Bharat as the Leader of the World!
