Om. namo vidvadbhyah ! Germany in the process has reiterated her trust  

and reverence in respect of Samskrit and certainly it has been now  

established that the three-language formula in India can not do

Samskrit should be so diposed to lead us to further vistas of Indian  
creativity, intellectuality, social cohesion and a dignified unity !  
Regards.
