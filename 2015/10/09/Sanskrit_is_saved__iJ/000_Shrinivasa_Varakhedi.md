Dear scholars,  
  
Again tiger had returned to attack cow!! Luck was strong. It was a narrow escape!!  
  
The new treaty was signed between govts of India and Germany with a mutual understanding that the German and Sanskrit will be taught in schools as special Foriegn language on reciprocal basis. That means Sanskrit will be offered in schools in Germany as a Foriegn language and German will be taught in schools in India as an optional Foriegn language in India. Thus, Sanskrit remains safe in its place in kendriya vidyalayas.  
  
This is the story of Sanskrit language in kendriya vidyalayas and in the entire nation. Many people do not have an idea that there had been a fear of tigers attack on cow! Some people wanted to replace Sanskrit with German. Just saved - sources confirmed.  
  
Of course the commitment of our prime minister along with MHRD is not questionable. Yet, unseen hands will sometimes work. The timely efforts of our policy leader and adviser to the minister Sri Ch mu Krushna Shastry Ji are commendable.  
  
Now we need to think how to take Sanskrit in schools from the first or pre narsary standards. Same states like kerala have already made Sanskrit as a language from the first standard in schools. This is THE way to promote Sanskrit in young minds. Let's start a debate in all states at least in the states where possibility is more.  
  
With best regards
