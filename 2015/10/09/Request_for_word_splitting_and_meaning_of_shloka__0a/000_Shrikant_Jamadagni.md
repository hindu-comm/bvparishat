Dear scholars

  

A friend showed me the following verse which can be read forwards and backwards. They do not know the source. I am told they convey praise of Rama and Krishna respectively - . Need padaccheda and meaning.  

  

तं भूसुतामुक्तिमुदारहासं वन्दे यतो भव्यभवं दयाश्री: ॥१॥

  

Read backwards it will be

श्रीयादवं भव्यभतोयदेवं संहारदामुक्तिमुतासुभूतं ॥२॥  

  

  

warm regards
