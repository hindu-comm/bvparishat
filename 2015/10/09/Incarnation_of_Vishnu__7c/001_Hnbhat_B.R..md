Do you mean Amara Lexicon  
  
वराहः सूकरो घृष्टिः कोलः पोत्री किरिः किटिः ( २. ४. ४४२)  
  
considering the words वराहः and सूकरः as synonyms is wrong? Please consider the context where both these words are used, the author considers follows Indian tradition of lexicon and not your biological classification you have found. This is what I have comment. Please follow Sanskrit tradition.

Tortoise actually spend most time on land and have heavy Armour on their back and not suited for lifting things  
  
  
  

"कूर्मे कमठकच्छपौ" ( १. १०. ५५८) considers both कमठ and कच्छप are used for कूर्म. This what the critical Editor has the gloss.

And here is the dictionary entry in Monier Williams Sanskrit English Dictionary which considers the word कूर्म is used for both:  
  
  
kūrma, as, m. a tortoise, a turtle; the  
earth considered as a tortoise swimming on the  
waters;  
  
VS Apte also gives it is used for turtoise in masculine  
  
A tortoise; gūhetkūrma ivāṁgāni rakṣedvivaramā- \[Page0417-a+ 56\]  

  

only like the Editors of Amarakosha Critical Edition. You are saying it is used for turtle and not for tortoise.

  

  

Please give references for your assumption and ask the opinion of the scholars.
