Namaste,

  

I am not saying it is wrong but i am just applying what i studied in zoology and trying to co-relate these two. I teach both Sanskrit and zoology to students at our school and hence i had a doubt about this. We are mainly trying to have an integration between the modern and traditional systems of education and i wanted to reconcile the anomalies.

I don't have any reference for my sayings.If its is wrong i am ready to accept it.

  

Regards

Raghuram
