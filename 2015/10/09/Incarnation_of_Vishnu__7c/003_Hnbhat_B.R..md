Sorry.

I am neither teaching Sanskrit not Zoology. But I have said only I could find the usage of these words as recorded by the literature and relying on dictionaries compiled by the Ancient and modern lexicographers.

If you find any anomalies, please present them quoting the usages in Sanskrit Literature. For example, the use of the word कूर्म in Bhagavadgita, could be interpreted as Turtle or Turtoise, where the Dictionaries record the usage of the word for both.

****यदा संहरते**** **चायं कूर्मोऽङ्गानीव सर्वशः ।**  
**इन्द्रियाणीन्द्रियार्थेभ्यस्तस्य प्रज्ञा प्रतिष्ठिताः ॥२.५८ ॥**

So that others also knowing Sanskrit only could understand your presentation.
