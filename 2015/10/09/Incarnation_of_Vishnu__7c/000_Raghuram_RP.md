Namaste,

  

Comparing zoology and incarnations here:

Vishnu's 3rd avatara is mentioned as varAha which is actually a wild boar in English but i have seen that many places the 3rd avatara is referred to as sUkara which is actually a pig. Similarly kUrma actually should refer to a turtle and not tortoise. kachapa may be a tortoise. But both kUrma and kachapa is referred to as tortoise. I request scholars to comment on this. Tortoise actually spend most time on land and have heavy Armour on their back and not suited for lifting things
