I don't understand what Krishna Kashyap wants to covey by this paragraph. I have never heard of extreme and moderate advaita. Yoga Vasita and Astavakra Gita give an Advatic view different from Sankara Advaita vedanta and if publishers publish different ancient texts whats wrong? If a follower has a view or follows a particular school of advaita whats wrong? How can you prove what you say is advaita and what Yoga Vasita says is not advaita? These are my comments
