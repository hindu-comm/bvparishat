Vidwan Krishna Kashyap would have been able to make a point if he mentioned specific details of Advaita Vedanta concepts mentioned in YV and AVG that are not in agreement with comparable aspects of Shankara's works.



Just using words like 'extreme form of Advaita' does not communicate his views well.
