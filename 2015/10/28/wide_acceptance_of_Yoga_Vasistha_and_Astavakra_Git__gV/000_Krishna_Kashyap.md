my views on Yogavasistha and Astavakra Gita are given below. Please comment.  

I feel that Yogavasistha and Astavakra Gita are not widely accepted. They were probably later texts written post 10th century. Even though they mention characters such as Agastya, Rama etc, who are famous mainstream personalities in Arsha sampradaya (the teachings of the Rishis), they cannot be located in the mainstream sources of (hindu or Arsha sampradaya) texts known as :14 vidhya sthanas

VEDAS(4):

1\. Rig vedam  
2. Yajur vedam  
3. Sama vedam  
4. Atharvana vedam

UPAANGAAS(4):

11.Nyayam (tarka)  
12.Mimamsa  
a. Poorva mimamsa &  
b. Uttara mimamsa(vedanta)  
13.Puranam (totally 18)  
14.Dharma sastram

  

Yogavasistha and Astavakragita represents an extreme form of Advaita, which is probably not in complete agreement with Shankaracharya's Advaita. However, we find translations and books on Yogavasistha and Astavakragita from the Ramakrishna Mutt books and other books. Many Advaita followers seem to support the content of these two texts just because it is Advaita without realizing that it represents an extreme form of Advaita.

  

What is the view of Advaita experts on this?
