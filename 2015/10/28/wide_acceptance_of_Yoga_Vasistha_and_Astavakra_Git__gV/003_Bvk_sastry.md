Namaste

  

The issue raised here links Yoga based Advaita traditions (- yoga vaasihta) with a focus on practice (upaasanaa- anushaasana pradhana) AND Advaita as presented in prasthana traya approach, which is knowledge( jnana pradhana)- primary.

  

If one concedes the primary definition that ' Advaita' means- an experiential state of total transcendence from all shades of duality by state, status and process ( avasthaa- sthiti- gati), then it defies all efforts to give an attribute to it, articulate and describe it as shuddha, vishista, et al. All such descriptions and texts come in the realm of duality with a path and pointer to a final state (- even if it is just a conceptualization, hypothetical, intellectually inconceivable)!

  

That is where Gita, as Yoga Shastra and upanishat saara - preconditions such a state as ' nir- dvandva', a state where realization is ' yo buddeh paratastu Sah'. And nitya- sattvastho- a test for having reached that state , for which yoga practical guidance is needed.

  

In this approach , teaching of yogavasasishta and Ashtavakragita are presenting YOGA lineage of fourteen vidyasthanas to complement jnana- pradhana lineage. Principle and practice to be tied together.

The same Srikrishna Parabrahma- Paramapurusha is also ' Yogeswara' giving yoga discourse in Gita, one of the primary anchors of veda- vidyas. ( unless one takes an exceptionally rare position that four vedas dont teach Yoga! And Yoga is not a main stream teaching from vedas). Therefore common names across traditions is not any defect or reason for dissent.

  

Another point to note here is: the Sri Rama of Yogavaasishta need not be equated with Srirama of Valmiki's context. The story narrative and character names may just be a frame to illustrate the principle. Nothing significant would be lost in such a scenario!
