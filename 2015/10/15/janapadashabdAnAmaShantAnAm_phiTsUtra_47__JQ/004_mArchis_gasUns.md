Lists of geographical names are of high interest to me as well. Data from the lists could be added to extract similar data from Sanskrit dictionaries for my Reverse Sanskrit Dictionary.

As Dhaval might remember I've got a list of 20k words with accents from Saint-Petersburg Sanskrit dictionaries, sample bellow (in reverse order), non-Devanagari (=IAST):

  

71494 yauthyáṃ

13022 uccā́ṃ

3839 anūrādhā́́ḥ

16168 éka

2\) If I reach the results one word, like <http://www.sanskritworld.in/sanskrittool/SanskritAccent/accent.php?first=bAdhirya&tran=SLP1&veda=0&gender=m&vAcya=kartR&sanAdi=&frontend=1&step=11> I hardly can get back to the "search" page. When I do get I have to click "Click for ajax" again.

  

3\) Testing based on my "20248-PWG-words-IAST-accents.txt" list:

  

bAdhirya (bā́dhirya) vs. बाद्हि॑र्य

Arjuneya (ārjuneyá) vs. आर्जुने॑य

  

4\) Wonder if you could make a batch comparison with "20248-PWG-words-IAST-accents.txt" and make a list of differences found - not 1 by 1, but all at once.
