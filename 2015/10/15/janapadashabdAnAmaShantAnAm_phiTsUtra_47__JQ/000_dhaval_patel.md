Respected scholars,  

  
The above quoted rule mandates some specific accents for words ending in vowels which are used for जनपद.  

Can anyone of you provide me to some list / reference where all (or at least major) जनपद names are enumerated / collated.  

My idea is that this is a finite group which may have been collated in some treatise.  

  

Thanks in advance
