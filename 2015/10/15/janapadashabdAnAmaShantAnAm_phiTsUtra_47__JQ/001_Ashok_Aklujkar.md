Dear Dr. Patel,  
  
The Vedic Index of Macdonell and Keith does not help in this matter, unless one isolates geographic names from its entries. Books on ancient Indian geography, particularly on place names mentioned in Vedic, Pali and Ardhamagadhi literature, will help. I cannot access these at the moment. Please consult the works of B.C. Law, D.C. Sircar et al.  
  
I tried to scan the entry in Mahadev Shastri Joshi’s (Marathi) \_Bharatiya Saṁsskṛti-kośa\_, vol 3, but the tight binding would not allow me to get a satisfactory scan (a Hindi translation of this reference work is also available, but it is not in myl collection). Pl see the attached for whatever its worth.
