I thought the first part of my post was relevant to your question.

  

"Is the reading found in a manuscript or a printed edition of the work? If in a printed edition, could it be a case of typographic error/editorial oversight resulting from confusion with वाङ्मय?"

  

If it was not, then I am sorry.
