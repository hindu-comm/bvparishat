Long ago a paper by late Biswanath Bhattacharya (1924-1983) of the Visva Bharati University was published on this subject. He tried to show that वाग्ग्मिन् should be the correct form. I do not have the paper immediately with me but I vaguely remember that he maintained that वाग्ग्ग्मिन् too will be a Pāṇinian form. The paper appeared, as far as I remember, in a Felicitation or Commemoration Volume published from erstwhile Madras.
