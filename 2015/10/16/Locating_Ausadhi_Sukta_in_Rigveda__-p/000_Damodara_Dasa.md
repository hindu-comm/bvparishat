Hare Krishna.  
Dear vidvajjanas,  
I heard that there is a sukta for ausadhi in rigveda that people used  
to recite while cutting herbs for medicine. I want to know which place  
in Rigveda is this (It starts something like yAvausadhi...). One  
scholar told me that it is somewhere in 4th chapter or mandala.  
  
Thankyou,  
Damodara Das
