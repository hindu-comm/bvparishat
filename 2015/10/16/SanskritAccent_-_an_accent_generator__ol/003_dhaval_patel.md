Respected Nityanand ji,  

We are unaware about previous attempts at computational simulation of accents either. Other stalwarts from field of Sanskrit NLP may like to shed light on earlier attempts.  
  

As regards the documentation paper / algorithm used, we would like to state that it is not yet made.  

But for interested scholar, reading <https://github.com/drdhaval2785/SanskritAccent/blob/master/accent.php> code from line 67 onwards would be beneficial.  
  

Typical code line would be something like this  
*  
*

*/\* phiTsUtra detail and number \*/  
*

*if (x condition is satisfied)  
{  
*

* store the phiTsUtra  
*

*}  
*

*elseif (y condition is satisfied)  
{  
*

* store the phiTsUtra  
*

*}  
*

*elseif ......  
  
*  
  

And for algorithm the major thumb rules are -  

1\. Rules requiring meaning or other external requirements are first priority.  

2\. Rules requiring finite list of words are second priority.  

3\. Rules applicable because of specific varNas at end etc are third priority.  
  

In general apavAdas get precedence over utsargasUtras.  

  

This is how the rules are arranged in code.  

Currently we are working on a study of commentaries to note which rules are exceptions to which ones. Probably a working paper would be ready by the next weekend.
