Congratulations for publishing this great work and keeping it open source. I guess this accent generator is the first of its kind? Please correct me if I am wrong.

  

Do you have the rules of स्वर in a पद or incorporated, likeअनुदात्तं पदमेकवर्जम्, उदात्तादनुदात्तस्य स्वरितः, etc?

  

If you have a diagram or paper documenting the workflow of the accent generator, it would be great to read.

  

Thanks, Nityanand
