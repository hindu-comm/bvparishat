Lord Buddha observed Chaturmasa some 3,860 years ago. It is interesting to note that according to the precessional calculation there has already been about 45 days shift of season from the time of Lord Buddha.  
  
The main reason for the sanyashis observing the Chaturmasa is due to the fact during the rainy season a large number of insects come out in the open and a large number of them get trampled under the feet of the people and the roving sanyashs walking on the roads. The sanyashis want to avoid that killing by remaining in one place during the rainy season. The householders observe the chaturmasa,as this period is not considered favorable for some of the religious rites
