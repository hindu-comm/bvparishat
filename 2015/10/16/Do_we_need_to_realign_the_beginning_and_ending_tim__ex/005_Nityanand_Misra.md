Dear Damodara Dasa Ji

  

That is the situation today. Thousands of years ago, the situation was very different: the rainy season started and ended earlier in the solar year. You may be aware of the phenomenon of *axial precession*, or the *precession of the equinoxes*. The earth’s axis completes one full rotation, tracing a double cone, in around 26,000 years. 360 degrees in 26,000 years means around 27.5 degrees (360 \* 26,000 / 2,000) in 2,000 years, which corresponds to around 28 days (365 \* 26,000 / 2,000) of shift. Around 2,000 years ago, the rainy season in India used to start 28 days earlier and end 28 days earlier in the solar year as compared to today. If you go back 3,200 years, this shift would be around 45 days (almost equal to 1.5 months). The term *vārṣikān māsān* would have been*anvartha*for those times when the rainy season would nearly coincide with the four months. The *upalakṣaṇa* explanation would have made sense if the term *vārṣikān māsān* were coined today, but not necessarily in the times of Mahābhārata or Paṇini.

  

Please refer section 1.2 titled The Precession of the Equinoxes in the paperMonsoon In Traditional Culture by Francis Zimmerman. The paper is available here: <http://ehess.philosophindia.org/anglasie/uploads/media/monsoons.pdf>



PS: The start time for the rainy season is also different in different regions of India. This should also be kept in mind.
