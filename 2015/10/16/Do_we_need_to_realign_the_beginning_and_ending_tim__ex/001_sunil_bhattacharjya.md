Dear friends,  
  
To my knowledge, the original criterion for the Chaturmasa was that it coincided with the four-month period of "Hari-Shayana".from the Ashadhi-Ekadash to the Kartiki-Ekadashi. The Tulasi-viavaha is on the next day after the Hari-shayana period is over. So this appears primarily to be according to the sidereal (nirayana) calendar and not the tropical (sayana) calendar. Somewhere along the way it could have got shortened to four-fortnights in place of four months, but the name Chaturmasa continued.  
  

It is interesting to note that the Mahabharata war started just after the Chaturmasa / Tulasi-vivaha.  
  

Regards,
