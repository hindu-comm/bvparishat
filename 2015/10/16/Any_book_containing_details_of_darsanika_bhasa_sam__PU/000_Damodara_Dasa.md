Hare Krishna.  
Dear vidvajjanas,  
  
I am looking for some explanation of sanskrit usages in darsanika  
bhasa, samadhi bhasa, and laukika bhasa. This is specifically  
regarding language used addressing different individuals in different  
usages.  
For instance in Gita Arjuna mentions names of Vedavyasa, asita,  
devala, etc without using honorifics. This is found consistently  
throughout many literatures like Ramayana, Mahabahrata etc. I wanted  
to know the rules governing these usages.  
  
If some book can explain these it will be very helpful.  
  
Thankyou,  
Damodara Das
