A friend of mine is inquiring for the text of Janaki Harana by Kumaradasa. I appreciate your responses.

  

-----Forwarded Message----

  

Is there a copy of Sanskrit work -- Janaki Harana of Kumaradasa with**all 20**contos available with anyone? Several copies of that book till 10 contos is available in internet.

  

Motilal Banarsidas has published one with Swaminathan and Raghavan as editors. It appears to have have the missing contos but, not all the poems are published in it..

  

Pls share the soft copy if you've.
