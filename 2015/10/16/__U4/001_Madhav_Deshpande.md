Dear Shri Haldar,

  

  I have attached the pdf of Candragomin's Śiṣyalekha from the Russian publication, and the pdf of a Sanskrit version of Nāgārjuna's Suhṛllekha. There are translation of these works from Tibetan and Chinese, but the Sanskrit originals may be of direct use to you. With best wishes,
