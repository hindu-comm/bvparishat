If a message goes out without a subject line in the header, Kindly provide the subject line as soon as possible.

  

It helps the prospective helpers if the inquirer lists or indicates the literature to which he/she already has access.

  

Much information aboutNāgārjuna’s Suhṛllekha is available in:Nagarjuniana (pp. 218-224). Ed. Lindtner, Christian. 1982. Copenhagen: Akademisk Forlag. Indiske Studier IV. A reprint edition is available in India (probably from Motilal Banarsidass). A revised edition, with the title Master of Wisdom, is available from Dharma Publishing in Berkeley, CA.
