There is also a verse where Lord Krishna is said to have advised that one should do kshaura-karma before and after Tuesday and accordingly it is believed that Monday and Wednesday are the auspicious days for Kshaura karma. I am also looking for this verse. However the Parva-days are to be avoided. It is also believed that if one does Kshaura-karma on a friday he will have shoka (grief).
