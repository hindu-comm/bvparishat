Dear Prof. Amba Kulkarni,  
  

Many thanks for your kind and detailed response. I was thrilled about your bold attempts at handling the two types of *s'les"a*.  

  

My reference was precisely to the combinatorial explosion that such situations present. As famously remarked by Roger Schank , the reputed Artificial Intelligence scientist of Yale University, "What a stupid three year old child can do \[=understand spoken language in no time\], the best of supercomputers cannot!" - in real time, that is. Language processing *sans* human assistance would be little more than a chimera (I am not, of course, referring to the computer program by that name!).  
  
That we keep constantly attempting what is yet beyond the pale of our ideas and tools is what keeps science progressing and technology advancing. Technology is, after all, a summation, an integration, and ultimately in-corpora-tion ( as embodiment and realisation) of techniques. And it is the tenacity in the attempt that throws open new possibilities, and that triggers novel imaginations. The generation and consideration of the close-to-million possibilities that you referred to, is at once the curse and the boon of the technology.  
  

I traced the origin of this problem to the oldest literature (in Sanskrit), precisely to show how the bias in favour of the samhitA-ed (=sandhied) text has its origin in the Vedic incantations, where you are not allowed to supplant the *samhitA* text by its visandhied substitute in the context of the *yajn"a*; else, the efficacy of the *mantra* is lost. Even more, the very manifestation of the *mantra,* in the first place*,* was in the samhita-ed form.  
  
The *yukti* (logic) behind the insistence on the sandhied form was that the very *abhivyakti* of the mantra-s (to the Rs"i-s), as well as the *viniyukti* (by the *yajamAna*) were by no means the "dismantled" form of speech - *sans chandas*, that is (Refer my Yaska quote in the first post). The philosophically valid, or rather technically efficient, role of *chandas* was one of protection by way of integration - from a state of our own *vy-A-dhi* to a state of *sam-A-dhi* (no different from *sandhi*, for that matter). This protective, or shielding, nature of *chandas* is made evident - equally, in the etymologies, of *chandas* latterly in the Upanis"ad-s, or of *samhitA* in as ancient texts as the *Aitareya* *BrAhmaNa* : *yac chandobhir AtmAnam samadadhAt, tasmAt **samhitA***. (The archetypal reference here is to what Brahma first did, post creation, hence holding out the model for humans to follow; I am not referring here to the Jungian archetypes.). This is also what I meant by the primacy and efficacy in the said post.  
  
Obviously, the Science of Prosody in the Vedic heritage did not rest content with paying attention to no more than mere rhyming that is the hall-mark of much of all other poetry (of other heritages, to wit), a child's play at best, but had goals to serve for the hereafter too.  
  

Incidentally, this double link - of *abhivyakti* and *viniyukti* stated above - is easily reminiscent of the twin aspects of *anubhAva* in Bharata's *nATya s'Astra*, a veritable coalescence of ex-pression (the natural outlet to *bhAva*) and im-pression (the conscious lead to the same *bhAva*).  

  
This explains why, from the ancient times of *Rk-prAtis'Akhya,* or even the very hymns, through men of varied disciplines such as Yaska, Gotama, Vamana, Nagesa, and even Charudeva Sastri of recent times, the emphasis and insistence on *samhitA* has thus been uniform. \[In a way, Cakrapani, the celebrated commentator on *Caraka SamhitA*, has even overshot, going beyond the expectation of Vamana's *ardhAnta*-*varjam,* and spun, curiously, a single word out of the *pUrvArdha* and (part of) *uttarArdha* in a verse of his I have across!\]  
  

This is also natural in another sense, for we never speak in our normal course, in such a way as to regularly hint at marked-off-word-boundaries. As this applies to all languages, we can see how Panini, Patanjali and Bhartrhari were well catering to the needs of Universal Linguistics, despite their apparent concern with little but Sanskrit (and their mapping of understanding of *apas'abda*-s via *sAdhu-s'abda*-s).  
  

Sorry for the prolix metaphysical excursus, but reverting to the mundane issue raised by Dr. Usha Sanka, I think we must embolden ourselves to re-understand the dictum of Patanjali I stated as the final item in my very first post viz. *artha-gaty-arthaH s'abda-prayogaH*, as "Our utterances ought to be user-friendly (to enable them to grasp the sense with as less effort as possible)." And as a corollary, computer-friendly.  
  
We may venture uninhibitedly, then, to institute newer notations or subtler *modus operandi* if they but serve our purpose.  
  
Comprehension-enablement, thus, is today's need, and we must cater to the same - not forgetting, though the prime importance of the unsandhied form whether in the Primordial literature that concerned our etymologists/grammarians and rhetoricians/prosodists , or in the spoken tongue that concerned the Sanskrit-knowing modern structuralist, Ferdinand Saussure, for example, so much.
