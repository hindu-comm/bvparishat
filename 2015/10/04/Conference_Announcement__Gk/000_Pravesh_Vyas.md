\>  
\> I am also glad to inform you, that Prof. Gupta has kindly agreed to be with us for all the three days during the Conference. Besides participating in the felizitation function for him, that will he held on one of the three days, it would also be a wonderful opportunity for us to interact with him. So kindly try to be here for all the three days.  
\>  
\> Some of the special events of the Conference:  
\> Release of a volume containing the selected articles of Prof. R C Gutpa -- which will be given as a compliment to the registered participants.
