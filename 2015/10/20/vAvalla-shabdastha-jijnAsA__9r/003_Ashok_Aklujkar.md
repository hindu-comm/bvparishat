Dear

  

viṣaktair in your typing should be corrected to viṣāktair (विषाक्तैर्) ’smeared with poison’

  

Smearing with poison is usually spoken of in the case of arrows. The mention of clouds being cut into a hundred pieces also indicates that the impact must have come from something that can be shot upwards.

  

The syntax needs vāvalla to be a noun. So, vyāpṛta will not do as a gloss.

  

The Pā.i.a-sadda-mahaṇṇavo = Prākṛta-śabda-mahārṇava, p. 762, records vāvalla as a deśī masc./neut. word meaning śastra-viśeṣa and occurring in that sense in Sanat-kumāra-carita, edited by H. Jacobiin 1921 (I cannot access this text at present).

  

The meaning fits. Its acceptance should not depend on whether we get a satisfactory (historical) etymology or Pāṇinian/Uṇādi derivation. A relation ov vāvalla with bhalla ‘a kind of arrow/arrowhead’ is plausible, but should not be taken as certain unless an acceptable accounting of the first syllable vā takes place.

  

a.a.
