The commentators on *nais"adhIya-carita* have of course remarked that *in'gAla* is a *bhAs"A s'abda*. The footnote remarks that substitution by *an'gAra* solves the problem. And Handiqui has chosen to note *in'gAla* itself as the alternative reading.  
  

The equation between *an'gAra* and "an'giras" is met with in two places :  

*aitareya brAhmaNa* 3.34, and  

*s'atapatha brAhmaNa* 4.5.1.8.
