Dear Prof Korada-ji,  
  

That *in'gAla* is a Prakrit form of *an'gAra* is evident, no doubt, from Prakrit grammars. Further, it is also a well known position in the Vedic literature that *an'gAra* and sage "an'giras" are equated. QED.  
  

But apart from this, there is also an explicit equation between "an'giras" and *in'gAla*, though I cannot immediately recall the source.  
  

Incidentally the word *in'gAla* (in the sense of embers) is in Pali also. And so in Marathi and Kannada. Some linguists have even attempted to link the word "angel" and *an'gAra*.  
  

Curiously, and as a rare Vedic remnant, there still is, in Bangalore-Mysore Road, a charcoal shop called "Angiraa Iddalu Angadi !"
