In the more ancient Vedic literature, all activities or actions are attributed in a three way format: दिव्य, अन्तरिक्ष, भौम: celestial, atmospheric and terrestrial respectively. Gandharva-nagara is atmospheric. My understanding is gandharvas as a species are also located in between दिव्य, andभौम:One can have a transition also:
मनुष्य-गन्धर्व and देव-गन्धर्व. This scientific classification seems to have got blurred in the later literature.
