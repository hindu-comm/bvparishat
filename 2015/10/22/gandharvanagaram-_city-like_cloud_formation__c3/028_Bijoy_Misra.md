Dear Sunilji,  

We have to distinguish between the concept and the form. Possibly the concepts  

existed in cosmology beginning with the Prajapati Kardama. We have to think  
whether the concepts were independent or if there were hybrids. Then we have  
to think how they could be used to explain the human conduct on earth.  
There is the theory that the human birth is special and one shoots to liberation  
from the human plane.  

Best regards,  

BM
