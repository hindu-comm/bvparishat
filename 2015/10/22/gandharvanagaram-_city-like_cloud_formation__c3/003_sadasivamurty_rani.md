It is very interesting to go through the current list of the progressive references of Gandhrva Nagara in this thread.

1. Prof. RN Iyengar Ji has made an attempt to correlate the ancient Indian Text references of Gandharva Nagara with the latest visual reference in the Internet to the Aliens' City in the Sky seen by the Chinese very recently.

  

2. Prof. KS Kannan Ji gave references to the instances from Vedanta where Gandharvanagara is used to compare the reality of the phenomenal world with it. Usually we come across a reference to this in the Upanishadic Bhashya of Adi Sankara where he compares the *Phenomenal world* with *Marichyambhah (mirage-water), rajju-sarpa (rope-snake), Shukti-rajata (Shell-silver), Akasha-tala-malinata (dusty surface of the sky), **Gandharvanagara (the City of Gandharvas)**, Maya (illusion), Kadali-garbha (Pantain-trunk), Svapna (Dream), jala-budbuda (Bubble), Phena (foam), alta-chakra (Moving fire-brand), mayanirmita-hasti (Magical elephant), Dvichandradarshana (Illusion of double moon)*etc.,
He owes his sources of these comparisons from like Guadapada and Mahayana Buddhism.

Here Gandharvanagara is used to prove the illusory nature of the phenomenal world.

  

3. Dr. Ganeshan ji has brought a curious reference from Banabhatta's Kadambari but mentioned it as from Sukanasopadesha.

As I read it is from the Mahasvetha Vrittanta of Kadambari. The context is like this:

During the Expedition of Chandrapida while having his ride on his Mystyic Horse Indrayudha he lost his way and reaches a Siddhayatana
where he met Mahasveta, a daughter of the King of Gandhrva Clan of demigods.

Here we have the beautiful description of the source of the Gandhrava Clan, the Geographical boundaries of Gandharva Region along with the picturesque details of the Gandharva loka and Antahpura (harem).

As mentioned there on one side of it there was the adjacent forest of Kirata Pura of HImalayan Regions which according to the Pauranic references agrees with Modern China.

**From this it may be possible to correlate this Bana's reference with the Alien's City seen recently by Chinese**. This is just a thought of its possibility of being so.

  

Here I would like add one more account from the Adiparva of Mahabharata where the reality of Gandhrava Nagara was considered as an acceptable fact.

"इदंशतशस्राख्यं श्लॊकानां पुण्यकर्मणाम् ।

उपाख्यानैस्सह ज्ञेयं श्राव्यं भारतमुत्तमम् ॥ 108

चतुर्विंशतिसाहस्रीं चक्रे भारतसंहिताम्।

उपाख्यानैर्विनैतावत् भारतं प्रॊच्यते बुधै:॥109"

  

"षष्टिं शतससहस्राणि चकारेमां च संहिताम्।

त्रिंशच्छतसहस्रं च देवलॊके प्रतिष्ठितम्।। 111

पित्र्ये पञ्चदशप्रोक्तं गन्धर्वेषु चतुर्दश।

एकं शतसहस्रं तु मानुषेषु प्रतिष्ठितम् ॥112"- श्रीमन्महाभरते आदिपर्वणि १ अध्याय: १११, ११२ श्लोकौ।

In this account of Adiparva of the Mahabharata some curious facts about the Mahabharata Texts are given.

As the literary world knows and as the internal evidences of the texts say the Mahabharata Samhita is of around 1,00,000 slokas including Upakhayanas. If it is without upakhyanas it is in 24,000 slokas.

But as the immediate couple of slokas say The Mahabharata was originally written by Veda Vyasa in 60,00,000 Slokas of which 30,00,000 Slokas were kept in the Devaloka. A text of 15,00,000 Slokas was kept in the world of Manes (Pitrloka). 14,00,000 Slokas Text is kept in the Gandharva Loka. The rest of the 1,00,000 Slokas is left to the human world.

This account supports the assumption that Gandharva Loka can be a reality.

I hope further probe into this matter may give us many more interesting facts.

Let us wait for other scholars' inputs also.

**Dr. Rani Sadasiva Murty**
