Yes, I too hold the same opinion as Shri Nagaraj Paturi Ji does.

Hence in my previous mail also I gave references to both the instances.

  

1\. In the metaphoric synonyms of the world "illusion" it was used in the Indian Philosophical systems particularly in the Mahayana Buddhisim, Gaudapada and Sankara.

  

An excellent phrase "weather-borne illusion" is used by Shri Nagaraj Paturi Ji. I shall take another occasion to add some more thoughts in this connection as I am in mid way of probe in this regard.

  

2\. As one of the 'real' celestial worlds it was seen in the Kadambari of Banabhatta and the Mahabharata of Vedavyasa..

  

I repeat though the story of Kadambari was a classical fiction standing as an illustration for KATHA type of GADYA the geographical boundaries described by Banabhatta are realistic. Somewhere amidst those boundaries there is a possibility of tracing it out.

  

3\. Even in the Matsya Purana while describing the Saptadvipas, there is a reference to the Gandhrva region almost in the boundaries matching with the boundaries specified by Banabhatta.

  

4\. So a probe towards its reality can be worthier and serve some purpose here in the present context to support of the root message of this thread.

  

Warm regards,
