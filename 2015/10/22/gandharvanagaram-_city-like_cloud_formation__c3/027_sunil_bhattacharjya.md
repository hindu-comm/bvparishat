Namaste,  
  

To my understanding the incorporeal beings the Gandharvas became so due to their one-track obsession for Sangeet, even though Sangeet is a mahavidya. They too have to take birth in the Karmabhoomi, to further their spiritual journey. This is true for the other divine beings as well. They are higher beings than we are and they too have to continue their spiritual journey.  
  

Regards,
