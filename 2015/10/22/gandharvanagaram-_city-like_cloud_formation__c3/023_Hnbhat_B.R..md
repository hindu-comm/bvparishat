Here is a selective list of divine clans

विद्याधराप्सरोयक्षरक्षोगन्धर्वकिंनराः (१.१.२२)  
पिशाचो गुह्यकः सिद्धो भूतोऽमी*देवयोनयः*. (१.१.२३)

दैत्यदैतेयदनुजेन्द्रारिदानवाः!  
शुक्रशिष्या दितिसुताः पूर्वदेवाः सुरद्विषः ।।१-१-१२।।

The असुर-s are called पूर्वदेवाः and children of दिति while देव- s are the children of अदिति. And the antimony and fights between the two groups is popular in Puranic Literature.
