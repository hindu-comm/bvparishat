Respected scholars, Namaskar!



What about Gandharva soldiers of Raja Dharmaraja who retired in Dvaitavana after loss of kingdom in dice game ?

.Duryodhana was captured by Gandharva soldiers when he under the pretense of Ghos'a yAtra visited Dvaitavana to observe miserable situation of Pandavas.Instead, he was captured and brought bound in front of Dharmaraja. Dharmaraja freed him.This was the highest insult of Duryodhana. He sat down for fasting unto to death. The rest of the story is known to many of you.

Regards N. R.Joshi

Nagrajji,  
  

This is a fairly exhaustive treatment. Broadly we can possibly say that Gandharva is the link between

the earthly activities and the heaven. There are twenty seven Gandharvas in this mapping. We may

try to examine what each does and why twenty seven etc. Gandharvas evaluate an activity

and carry the impression "upward" (relative to the earth).



Dr Ramanujan cited the mantras to invoke the Gandharva. It is not clear if a mantra would invoke

the Gahdharvas collectively or if there would be a hierarchy.  From his message  

तत्र राष्ट्रभृन्नामकमन्त्राः गन्धर्वाप्सरसः उद्दिश्य विहिताः ।

अग्निः, सूर्यः, चन्द्रमाः, यज्ञः, मनः, वातः, मृत्युः, पर्जन्यः, कामः इत्यादयः

गन्धर्वाः स्वस्वाप्सरोभिः सह उद्दिष्टाः ।  
  

You may check your excellent resources. Then we may go into the other terms cited in Dr Bhat's  

posting.  
  

Extremely interesting.
