div=radiance then actually refers to 'super-material' (energy?)  

  

“दिव्” धातु has various declensions and various shades of meaning –. ९-४-१ दिव् – 4 प. दिवु क्रीडा-विजिगीषा-व्यवहार-द्युति-स्तुति-मोद-मद-स्वप्न-कान्ति-गतिषु ।

  

So rellying on div= radiance only would be superficial.

  

सुरलोको द्योदिवौ द्वे स्त्रियां क्लीबे त्रिविष्टपम् ।।१-१-६॥  

  

which means द्यौः दिव् both mean heaven, or स्वर्ग.

सुमनसस्त्रिदिवेशा दिवौकसः ।।१-१-७।। all the देव-s are said to be dwellers of दिव्. Both the words are used to denote sky also, which is again the path of the देव-s.  

  

*द्योदिवौ द्वे स्त्रियामभ्रं व्योम* पुष्करमम्बरम् %

( १. २. १६८) नभोऽन्तरिक्षं गगनमनन्तं *सुरवर्त्म खम् ।।१-२-१।*

  

The word दिव्य itself the meaning of celestial, directly as explained by etymology दिवि भवम्, either in heaven or sky as the case may be, which is related with one of the meanings of the word celestial as I had pasted the description. To be precise, celestial beings either physical or angels, epirit etc.

  

The above words are used in the sense by the time of Amara compiled his categorical lexicon according to meaning.
