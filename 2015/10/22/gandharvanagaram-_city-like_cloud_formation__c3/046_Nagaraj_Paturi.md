\>दिव्” धातु has various declensions and various shades of meaning



Many roots/words have such polysemy. But an etymologist takes only the meaning that suits the context.



Among various meanings दिवु क्रीडा-विजिगीषा-व्यवहार-द्युति-स्तुति-मोद-मद-स्वप्न-कान्ति-गतिषुonly द्युति and /or कान्ति suit the present context of divya beings and divyalokas.



\> Both the words are used to denote sky also, which is again the path of the देव-s.



I do not disagree.



But the meaning sky is only in general meaning. That is why I said, "It does not in the *ultimate analysis* refer to the upper skyvisible to the earth-dwellers. It means 'super-material' 'beyond physical' etc."
