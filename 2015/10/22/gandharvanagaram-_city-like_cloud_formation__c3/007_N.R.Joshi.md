Respected scholars, Namaskara!



What Prof Korada said about Gandharva nagara is correct.



It is mirage seen in the desert in the middle east countries under hot sun. The whole city appears as upside down in the sky. Its is described in Mahabharata. There is description also of floating city called Saubha nagara of the the king ShAlva in the Mahabharata.

Thanks. N. R. Joshi
