Some 50/60 years back,a gentleman from Bombay-from the field of Education-,Shri N.G.Tavkar,-wrote an excellent book/essay on 'Yakshas,Kinnaras and Gandharvas".

  

Possibly,this was the first book on this topic.

  

This book is not much known even to the Sanskrit scholars and hence,not much referred to. He has given ample evidence to support his arguments about Yakshas etc. It will be a profitable reading if any one can get access to this book,which must be available only in old Libraries.We have one copy in the Oriental Institute,Baroda.  

His other books are in Marathi on "Ancient Indian Universities" (प्राचीन भारतीय विद्यापीठे) .and "Ancient Indian Science and Technology" (प्राचीन भारतीय ज्ञानविज्ञान ).

These books also give a fund of information-well documented too- with supporting evidences.
