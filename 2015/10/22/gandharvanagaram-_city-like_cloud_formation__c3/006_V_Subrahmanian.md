I vaguely remember to have seen a reference to gandharva nagaram in the Srimadbhāgavatam. In some vyākhyana of advaita, maybe the Bhāmati or Ratnaprabha (not sure) a description of how it appears is given. It is, as I remember, a phenomenon seen in a forest. Maybe scholars of this forum will recall the exact reference.
