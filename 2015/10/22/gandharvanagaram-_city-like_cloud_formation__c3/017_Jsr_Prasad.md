Here is the verse from Srimadbhāgavatam 4.12.15 -  

मन्यमानमिदं विश्वं मायारचितमात्मनि ।  

अविद्यारचितस्वप्नगन्धर्वनगरोपमम् ।।  
  

Caraka quotes about 'gandharvapura' at 1.9.14  
गन्धर्वपुरवन्नाशं यद्विकारं सुदारुणाः ।  

यान्ति....... ।। While approaching a 'good' doctor, all afflictions would be disappeared like a gandharvapura. When a psedo doctor is approached, then the vikāras would grow like a gandharvapura. Such a way, both 'anvaya-vyatireka' method is quoted by Cakrapani citing this example.
