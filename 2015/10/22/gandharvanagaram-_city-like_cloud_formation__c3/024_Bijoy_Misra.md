Dear Dr Bhat,  
Excellent.  

They each have a role in the conduct of life.  

Buddhists possibly expanded them to create a science out of it.  

To me, these are all attempts to map the mind. The attempt  

itself is interesting to me.  

Please do post any other literature on the subject, particularly  

if there is any characterization of the terms.  

Best regards,  

BM
