Shri HNBhat Mahodaya!

I am extremely sorry for wasting your most valuable time. It was not at all my intention to post the same matter twice. At 9.08AM I posted it for the first time. Then my computer started buffering and I did not receive any sent message and my message also was not seen in the posted list. In the meanwhile I posted another two lined message. After that I posted the same message at 9.18AM. I could see it at 9.25AM.

I could see my first message posted at 1.15 PM. It is all because of the inconvenient internet connection I have at home.

It was not intentional to post the same twice.

Once again I apologize for my mistake.

Warm regards,

**Dr. Rani Sadasiva Murty**
