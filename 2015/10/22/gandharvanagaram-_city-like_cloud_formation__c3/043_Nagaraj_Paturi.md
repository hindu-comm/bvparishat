As far as use of the word 'celestial' in this thread is concerned, it was I who used it while saying,

"Gandharvanagara as a word referring to a weather-borne illusion in the skies and Gandharvaloka as a word referring to one of the 'real' celestial worlds seem to be two different words".



So let me clarify that I used it for want of a better word for 'divya' . 'divyaloka' was intended by using the word'celestial world'.



The word 'divya' etymologically has got to do with div=light, radiance. divya= made of light/radiance.



Beings such as Gandharvas are described as tEjass'arIrAh 'those with a body made of light/radiance/ 'non-material'/energy.



'oordhva' in words like 'oordhvalokaah' does not in the ultimate analysis refer to the upper skyvisible to the earth-dwellers. It means 'super-material' 'beyond physical' etc.



'Super-material'beings such as Gandhrvas 'dwell in' or 'make'different 'oordhvalokas' (super-material worlds). The word 'divya' refers to this 'super-material' , 'beyond physical' nature of these beings and their 'worlds'. div=radiance then actually refers to 'super-material' (energy?)



They may (be believed/described as to)take aas'raya in a physical entity. But they are not (believed/described as )that physical entity itself.
