Dear Nagarajaji,  

We have to understand Gandharvas as another cosmological construct.
Like Devas show up in oblation rituals,  

Gandharvas show up in music and arts events. We do not need to make any physical association with the  

concept. The way I think is these are unseen elements that surround us and assemble to help us when we have  

an effort. There are also other terms like nAga and kinnara which have similar connotation. I do not have a full list.  

They are different concepts with which the human are associated to conduct their life. Valmiki uses them profusely.  
It would be interesting to discover their cosmological implications in order to understand their influence on human  
life and conduct.  

Best regards,  

Bijoy Misra
