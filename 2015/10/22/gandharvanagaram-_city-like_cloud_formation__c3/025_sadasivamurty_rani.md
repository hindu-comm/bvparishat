Dear All,

Here is an amazing account found in the Ramayana related to the instance of Bio diversity. This account acknowledges the common origin of all the Divine Beings of Celestial regions and the living beings from man to reptiles of the Earth and shows  a cosmological link of all Divine and Human beings and of all animals, birds and trees.

Please find it in the following attachment of this mail.

Warm Regards,

**Dr. Rani Sadasiva Murty**

Dear Nagarajaji,  

We have to understand Gandharvas as another cosmological construct.
Like Devas show up in oblation rituals,  

Gandharvas show up in music and arts events. We do not need to make any physical association with the  

concept. The way I think is these are unseen elements that surround us and assemble to help us when we have  

an effort. There are also other terms like nAga and kinnara which have similar connotation. I do not have a full list.  

They are different concepts with which the human are associated to conduct their life. Valmiki uses them profusely.  
It would be interesting to discover their cosmological implications in order to understand their influence on human  
life and conduct.  

Best regards,  

Bijoy Misra
