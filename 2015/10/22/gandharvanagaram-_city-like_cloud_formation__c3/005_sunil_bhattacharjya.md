Namaste,  
  

Gandharva nagaram may be in imagination and so also the following imaginative statement in the Mahabharata. Vedavyasa could have used this exaggeration more as an alankara and this could have been one of the Kutaslokas, which was meant for baffling the scribe Lord Ganesha, which probably left Lord Ganesha wondering as to how could Vedavyasa had composed six million verses.
