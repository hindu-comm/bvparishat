'Gandharvas' like all the other 'interesting' (unreal-looking) things in mythological narratives such as Mahabharata are names and forms employed to visualize 'real' abstract entities which interacted/interact with humans through subjective-looking means of interaction.



For example, there is a narrative in which Gandharvas get injured in different parts of their body when different musical notes are wrongly sung. Shiva heals their injuries by singing the notes properly. This narrative presents Gandharvas as (elements of) music itself.



Some other narratives present them as 'spirits' 'charging' /'presiding over'aspects of wilderness. There probably is a possibility of connecting the music aspect of Gandharvas with this feel of wilderness aspect, since the feel of wilderness has a 'music' of its own.



Similarly Gandharva loka too can be seen to be a 'world' that can be reached through subjective looking means of 'feel' or a different state of consciousness.



Attempts to locatesuch lokas in geographical and/or astronomical landscape were made in the early days of myth-understanding when myths were attempted to be understood as history or descriptions of the concrete objectively reachable tangible reality. During such attempts, Gandharvas were attempted to be identified with certain human communities and Gandharva loka with theirgeographicallocation.



Greater understanding of such mythological ideas as abstract entities rendered such interpretations obsolete.
