Nagrajji,  
  

This is a fairly exhaustive treatment. Broadly we can possibly say that Gandharva is the link between  

the earthly activities and the heaven. There are twenty seven Gandharvas in this mapping. We may  

try to examine what each does and why twenty seven etc. Gandharvas evaluate an activity  

and carry the impression "upward" (relative to the earth).  

  

Dr Ramanujan cited the mantras to invoke the Gandharva. It is not clear if a mantra would invoke  

the Gahdharvas collectively or if there would be a hierarchy.  From his message

  

तत्र राष्ट्रभृन्नामकमन्त्राः गन्धर्वाप्सरसः उद्दिश्य विहिताः ।

अग्निः, सूर्यः, चन्द्रमाः, यज्ञः, मनः, वातः, मृत्युः, पर्जन्यः, कामः इत्यादयः

गन्धर्वाः स्वस्वाप्सरोभिः सह उद्दिष्टाः ।  
  

You may check your excellent resources. Then we may go into the other terms cited in Dr Bhat's  

posting.  
  

Extremely interesting.
