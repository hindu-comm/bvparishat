It is a new thing the Gandharva soldiers of Raja Dharmaraja who captured Duryodhana.

As far as I know the gandharva-s who capture d Duryodhana on the Ghoshayatra were not the soldiers of Yudhishthira and only Pandavas relieved Duryodhana and his followers from the custody of Gandharva-s. They didn't bring him to Yudhishthira themselves.

This is the entry from Mahabharata Name Index:

*(rājā)*(on the ghoshayātrā*D.*and his  
followers are made prisoner by the Gandharvas, but set freeby the Pāṇḍavas; at this*D.*becomes dejected and is resolved \[Page277-a+ 63\]  
to give up his life).-

Here is the detailed account of the context which makes clear that he was not brough to Yudhishthira by the sldiers of Citrasena himself but after a fierce fight with Arjuna by the order of YudhiShthira:

Ghoshayātrāp.): III,**236,**14752, 14770: While the  
Pāṇḍavas were dwelling at the lake \[of Dvaitavana\],  
Dhṛtarāshṭra was much afflicted, thinking that Arjuna  
would not have left heaven, where he received the celestial  
weapons, if it were not for the purpose of avenging himself  
and his brothers.**243,**14941, 14956: Duryodhana, etc., \[Page073-a+ 63\]  
having set out to insult the Pāṇḍavas under the pretext  
of supervising their cattle stations, was vanquished by the  
*Gandharva king Citrasena;*

*Duryodhana was made captive,  
*

*and the soldiers took refuge with Yudhishṭhira, who pre-  
vailed upon Arjuna to rescue Duryodhana, he being himself  
prohibited by a sacrifice.*

**244:**As the Gandharvas would  
not set free Duryodhana, etc., as requested by Arjuna,  
a fierce battle ensued.**245,**14984, 15001, 15002, 15003,  
15004, 15005: The Gandharvas in vain attempted to break  
the cars of the Pāṇḍavas; especially Arjuna sent millions  
of them to the abode of Yama by means of his Āgneya  
weapon. The Gandharvas then rose up to the skies, taking  
the Dhārtarāshṭras with them, showering maces, darts, etc.,  
upon Arjuna, who killed them with his weapons Sthūṇākarṇa  
(C. Sthūlāº), Indrajāla, Saura, Āgneya, and Saumya. At  
last Citrasena rushed at Arjuna, armed with a mace of iron;  
when Arjuna had cut that mace into seven pieces with his  
arrows, Citrasena, by means of his science, concealed himself  
from the view of Arjuna, and thus continued to fight with  
him; but Arjuna destroyed his power of concealing himself by  
shooting at him with his celestial arms, guided by the sound  
*(çabdavedhaṃ* *samāçritya).*Then Citrasena showed himself  
to Arjuna, reminding him that he was his friend, and the  
battle was interrupted.**246,**15010: Citrasena relates that  
he had been acquainted with the purpose of Duryodhana,  
etc., and had been requested by Indra to bring Duryodhana  
thither in chains; Arjuna entreated him to set Duryodhana  
free, but, at the request of Citrasena, they left the matter to  
be decided by Yudhishṭhira; Yudhishṭhira then liberated all  
the Kauravas  
cowherds.

So the name of Gandharva king was Citrasena and his soldiers captured Duryodhana and his followers and were released only after a fierce battle by Arjuna he was compromised to surrender him to Yudhishthira.

  

There was a Yaksha, who was banished by their king, for some violation of rules, for one year out of the city and during his exilement, he sent a message through a cloud, as Kalidasa recorded it as "The cloud messenger" मेघसन्देश.

  

There are some more Yaksha-s episodes in Mahabharata itself and the general idea is here in Puranic Encylopedia which is available online and anybody could use it for information regarding Puranic information:

  

YAKṢA.

  

1\) General. A class of Semi-gods. There are chiefly

three classes of inhabitants in Heaven:— Devas, Gaṇa-

devas and Upadevas. Gaṇadevas consist of the 12

Ādityas, 10 Viśvadevas, 8 Vasus, 36 Tuṣitas, 64 Ābhās-

varas, 49 Anilas 220 Mahārājikas, 12 Sādhyas and 11

Rudras.

Among the Upadevas there are 10 subdivisions. They

are, Vidyādharas, Apsaras, Yakṣas, Rākṣasas, Gandhar-

vas, Kinnaras, Piśācas, Guhyakas, Siddhas and Bhūtas. \[Page893-a+ 65\]


  

2\) Origin. There are different views relating to the

origin of the Yakṣas. In Mahābhārata, Ādi Parva,

Chapter l we find that the Yakṣas took birth after

Brahmā's birth from “Virāṭ Puruṣa's” aṇḍa. According

to a statement in Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 19, Yakṣas and

Rākṣasas were born from Munī, the grand daughter of

Kaśyapaprajāpati. Thus Yakṣas and Rākṣasas are relat-

ed as brothers. In Mahābhārata, Ādi Parva, Chapter 66,

Verse 7, there is another passage which says that Yakṣas

are the progeny of the sage Pulastya.



3\) Other details.

i\) Once Śukadeva sang the story of Mahābhārata to the

Yakṣas. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 1, Verse 108).

\(ii\) Lakhs of Yakṣas remain in Kubera's assembly,

worshipping him. (M.B. Sabhā Parva, Chapter 10,

Verse 18).

\(iii\) There are Yakṣas in Brahmā's assembly also.

(M.B. Sabhā Parva, Chapter 11, Verse 56).

\(iv\) Kubera is the King of Yakṣas. (M.B. Vana Parva,

Chapter 111, Verse 10).

\(v\) Bhīmasena once drove away Yakṣas and Rākṣasas.

(M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 16, Verse 57).

\(vi\) On another occasion, Sunda and Upasunda defeated

and persecuted the Yakṣas. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chap-

ter 208, verse 7).
