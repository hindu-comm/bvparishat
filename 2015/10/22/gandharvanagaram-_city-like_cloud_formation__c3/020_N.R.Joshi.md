I agree with Prof N. Paturi. Gandharva-nagara is not Gandharva loka.

Mahabharat has many interesting things such as ChAlikya gAyan prakAra, JAmbunada suvarNa and Ladies kingdom. Thanks. N.R.Joshi

Gandharvanagara as a word referring to a weather-borne illusion in the skies and Gandharvaloka as a word referring to one of the 'real' celestial worlds seem to be two different words.
