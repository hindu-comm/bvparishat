Respected scholars Namakar!



Yaksha king Kuber was half brother of Ravana. Rakshasas and Yakshas were related. Ravana conquered Kuber's Alkapuri and drove him out. Although Kuber was described as weird looking, Yakshas were described as model of beauty in ancient texts. . Also Yaksha-sthana means a toll booth. Thanks. N. R. Joshi.
