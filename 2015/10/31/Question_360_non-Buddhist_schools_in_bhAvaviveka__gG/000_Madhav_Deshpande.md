Dear Colleagues,

  

  A student of mine, Ann Johnson, is reading Bhāvaviveka's Tarkajvālā, in Tibetan, and found a reference to a list of 360 non-Buddhist schools. She has listed more than 100 of these names in English translation from Tibetan. I would like to know if there is anywhere in Buddhist literature, a Sanskrit list of these or similar non-Buddhist schools. Since the Tarkajvālā is not available in its Sanskrit original, figuring out the original Sanskrit names of these schools from their Tibetan translations is a challenging task. Any help would be appreciated.
