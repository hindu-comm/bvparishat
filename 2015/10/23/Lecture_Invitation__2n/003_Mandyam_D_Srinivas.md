Dear Prof. Iyengar,

  

There is some indication in classical literature on Indian demography, though I could not go into it in my lecture focussed on the 1881-2011 period covered by the Censuses.

  

Kautilya's Arthasastra II.1 (as cited by P.V. Kane History of Dharmasastrea Vol III, p. 134) says that a grama should have between 100 to 500 families/households.

  

शूद्रकर्षकप्रायं कुलशतावरं पञ्चशतकुलपरं ग्रामं ...

  

The classical texts also talk of different regions of India having
lakhs of gramas. For instance, the Aihole inscription of Immadi Pulikesin talks of his samrajya comprising 99,000 gramas. The collection of articles on Geography of Ancient India by DC Sircar has several such citations.

  

Taking classical India to have 5 lakh gramas of the Arthasastra type, we can estimate that it would have 5 crore to 25 crore households. This with a family size of 6-8 would lead to an estimate of population at least of the order of 50 crores.

  

If I recollect correctly, in the 16th century, Ferishta mentioned that
the population of India prior to the Muslim conquest was 60 crores.

  

In any case, this is a subject that needs to be investigated in much greater depth and detail, by looking into both the literary sources and the inscriptions.

  

Best regards

  

M D Srinvias
