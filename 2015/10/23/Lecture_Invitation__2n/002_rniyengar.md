Dear Prof.MDS,

I heard your brilliant lecture in Kannada at GIPA, Bangalore on the same subject. Your work is based on empirical data which any one can verify and independently analyse.This group, as I have experienced, is devoted to Indian Culture

in its various aspects, but mostly based on textual traditions. One aspect that is not clear from ancient texts is the demographic dimension. Even though जनपदare described, no specific information comes out about जनसंख्या

except for a few oblique references in some of the shilpashastra texts. Better late than never! You and your colleagues have worked with great scientific care to show how भारतीयसंस्कृति has changed over time and is changing dynamically even now in the subcontinent.

Well done!  

  

best regards

RNI
