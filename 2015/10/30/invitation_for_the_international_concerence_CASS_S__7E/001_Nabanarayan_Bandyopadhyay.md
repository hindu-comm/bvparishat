Dear Prof. Muley,

Congratulations for the endeavour to organize an international conference on Yoga. Hope this will be very successful under your able leadership. Inadvertently the dates have been mentioned **24th January** to 27th February 2016 in this notification; most probably it will be 24th-27th February 2016 (verified from the attachment).

Regards,
