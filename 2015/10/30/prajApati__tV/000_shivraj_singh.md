Dear List,

 I am trying to find out in what form, spelling wise, does the word प्रजापति exist in various languages of India?  

 I would like to see this word spelt using a single script across various languages of India.

  

 Hindi/Sanskrit is given on the subject. Can we use devnagari script or Harvard Kyoto to write this word in tamil, malayalam, telugu, kannada, marathi.....etc?

  

  

Thanks,

Shivraj
