Dear Mr Singh,  

As I had said earlier, you are totally missing the point.  

Speech in various areas has its own accent and tonality.  

It does change with syllables and what Bhartrhari calls  
samhati. If you have studied these and have a theory  

then individual word examples could become useful.  

Please write if you have looked into smaller groups  

that are similar: Hindi, Rajasthani, Punjabi  

or Oriya, Bengali, Assamese etc. If you have interest  

do make local comparisons on many examples.  

Let the exercise create some knowledge.  

BM
