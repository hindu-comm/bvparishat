Nagraj,  
\>  Can you please write the spelling both phonetic (since you mention small difference in pronounciation) and the real spelling in nagari or harvard kyoto as it occurs in tamil? Would you know telugu, malayalam etc too?  
\>  
\> Language Spelling    Phonetic   
\> Hindi / Sanskrit: प्रजापति प्रजापति  
\> Tamil  
\> Teulugu  
\> Malayalam  
\> .

After all what do you want of the word प्रजापति?

As you have written, you have not used only Devanagari script which used in common for writing Hindi and Sanskrit in both columns spelling and phonetic and you have yourself used phonetic script. Phonetic script is used to note down the pronunciation of any language and not use by the common users of the language to write the language.

There are more than 17 registered languages used for language wise classification of States though overlapping is seen in border regions. Each language has its own intonation of speech and some languages use common script.

What is your purpose? For a list as you have written, any Individual language software like Baraha or Bhasha would convert the word into different Indian scripts used for Indian languages which yourself can do. But it will not convert into phonetic script.

Only the purpose of the list you wanted is not clear.
