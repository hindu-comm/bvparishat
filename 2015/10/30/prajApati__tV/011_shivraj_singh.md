--Why should you ask the members of this forum of scholars विद्वत्परिषत् to do this work without any specific purpose?

--If you want to know the changes in the regional languages, you need to have a field survey of a selected Sanskrit words list representative of all the phonemes of Sanskrit languages.

  

I am surprised by your take on this issue. I have not even seen the data and neither have you. But you have already proclaimed why this effort is worthless. Can you see the future Dr Bhat?  

  

Just for the record I asked a very simple question and not a comparitive study of indian langauges.

  

I was hoping that we have Indians from all states on this forum and it would take them a second to respond how prajapati is written in their langauge and how it is pronounced. But I guess it is not the case.

  

Any way please don't scratch your brain more on this.

  

Best Wishes,

Shivraj
