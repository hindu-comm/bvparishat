"*प्रयोजनमनुद्दिश्य*मन्दोऽपि न प्रवर्तते!"

Why should you ask the members of this forum of scholars विद्वत्परिषत् to do this work without any specific purpose?

If you want to know the changes in the regional languages, you need to have a field survey of a selected Sanskrit words list representative of all the phonemes of Sanskrit languages. But the original speech sounds of Sanskrit Sounds without regional influence would be a basic necessity for such a Survey. This survey only linguists could do and not a list in different scripts. And not a single word is enough for this purpose.

The phonetic changes are effected in तद्भव words in different languages which is matter of comparative linguistics. This also would take effect differently for different languages following certain principles. And not for the word प्रजापति only.
