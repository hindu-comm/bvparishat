Yes sure there will be regional variations in any language. Even Vedic are pronounced different depending on the persons individual training and mother tongue influence. Why have you exclusively selected प्रजापति? you refused to answer this question asked to you. Is this directed towards a larger study of regional changes in pronunciation of Vedic words? if yes then this discussion will be useful.
