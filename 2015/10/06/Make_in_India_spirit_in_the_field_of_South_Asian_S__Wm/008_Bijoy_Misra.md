Dr. Ajit Gargeswari is a moderator to the list and his point of view needs respect and consideration.  

What India does or does not, may not totally depend on what might happen abroad. In the world,  

all are free to study material in their own interests and furthering their own goals whatever they might be.  
  

Lately we had an exhaustive discussion on the origin of hot chilies and their role in nutrition.  

There were literature citations on the efficacy and the prescription on the application. To me, the  
whole discussion lacked the "knowledge value" that we may impart in a class to the young students.  

A statement does not become knowledge through its enunciation or citation. I request all to think  

if we can come out of this textual reproduction style and apply analysis as an educator must do.  

The narrative form of knowledge distribution can create believers but not scholars. A scholar  

must touch and feel and convince oneself through experimentation. The Indian knowledge system  

has a built in tone of this experimentation. Finding varieties of tone is not the research but  

efforts to re-examine and re-enunciate the tone is. This has been my view.  
  

Blind acceptance of the texts and its repetition to the students in a controlled setting amounts to  

religious preaching. This technique was invented in the west where the expansion of knowledge  

got controlled by faith and religion. India maintained her open examination for a long time until  

the impact from the invaders was so high that expansion of knowledge was compromised in favor  

of simple acceptance. Free thinking is a function of the state of the society and its sustenance  

of scholarship. India shines in the world in the field of education by having discovered the technique  

of independent discovery for conviction and expansion. The Gita announced at least fifteen hundred  

years ago that an ounce of living could be superior to mugging a hundred books. India and the  

world has continuously called the SriKrishna the supreme teacher for such discovery, however  

empirical it may be.  
  

"Make in India" should not be a goal to repeat more texts but understand the application of them  

in life through experimentation, analysis, failures and reexamination.
Knowledge is never frozen.  

India has to build new knowledge based on her glorious past. Nutrition was a good example. We  

did not see a single posting on the medical and clinical value of the chilies. India has to come  

out of the mode of faith-healing to understand the dignity of the faith. The scholars have to research:  

how does faith heal or does it? We have to distinguish between global empirical truth versus various  

blind enunciation. The latter could have a cloak of business like any faith has. To rescue scholarship  

from the clutches of faith and business would be the rediscovery of India and the discovery of a mind  
where a book like Ramayana could be written purely from the first principles.
