I am aware of Orientalism, Post colonial studies, colonial studies Women and gender studies, contemporary history all such and related areas should and must be discussed in BVP. BVP is the place for such discussion. Legitimate academic activity must and should be discussed. I was only pointing out to funding in US or Europe which for a Chair or posts from non academic blogs. Lets discuss more of academics and less of controversies is my opinion. Controversial and sticky topics once in a while if fine but not every month or discussion on every blog on the net.  
  

To answer shreyasji question If a sponsor is looking to fund Chair how is the blog related?
