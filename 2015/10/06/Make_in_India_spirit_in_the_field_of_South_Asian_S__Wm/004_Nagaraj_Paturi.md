Let us not every month come up with threads about decolonizing minds and youths.  

  

-- Why not Dr Gargeshwari?

  

Why should you force your views on youths the so called Make in India’ spirit in the field of South Asian Studies'  

  

---- Where is 'forcing' of views here?

  

Rajiv Malhotra or no Rajiv Malhotra, decolonization is not an exhausted topic.

  

A scholar like Prof. Edward Said coming up with a new concept called , 'Orientalism' which is now an established category in academics all over the world was possible only as part of attempts to critique the colonial studies.

  

An urge for evolving an Indian approach to Social Sciences and Humanities is long standing, irrespective of Rajiv Malhotra. Earlier, the urge used to pop up in the seminars, conferences and symposia of universities. Outsiders to universities were asking why universities were not doing such a thing. Rajiv is one of these uinversity-outsiders , a late entrant, to my knowledge, a disgruntled NRI parent who, in stead just protesting the way India was represented in the books of their children, has been constantly working towards achieving countering the misrepresentation that offended his children.

  

Hence RM or no RM, the legitimate urge for a critique of the west-born contemporary methods in Social Sciences and Humanities, shall continue. This is a legitimate academic activity without any hate aspect involved. Forums like BVP are the suitable venues for such discussion.
