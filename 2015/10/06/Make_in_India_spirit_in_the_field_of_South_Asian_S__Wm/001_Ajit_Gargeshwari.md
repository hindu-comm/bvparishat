There are private and goverment funding in India for humanities including Sanskrit studies. Many mathas are funded privately. Many individual projects are funded privately Lets us not be too critical about how a chair gets funded in US. Ford foundation have contributed money to several Indian institution too. Let us not every month come up with threads about decolonizing minds and youths. Why should you force your views on youths the so called Make in India’ spirit in the field of South Asian Studies' Many of matahas keep reciting declension of Rama Sabda from morning till night who is going to fund them I am not saying all but a few. Reading Rajiv Malhotras is fine but a need to comment on every blog he posts may not be required
