\>Lately we had an exhaustive discussion on the origin of hot chilies and their role in nutrition.  
There were literature citations on the efficacy and the prescription on the application. To me, the  
whole discussion lacked the "knowledge value" that we may impart in a class to the young students.  
A statement does not become knowledge through its enunciation or citation. I request all to think  
if we can come out of this textual reproduction style and apply analysis as an educator must do.  
The narrative form of knowledge distribution can create believers but not scholars. A scholar  
must touch and feel and convince oneself through experimentation. The Indian knowledge system  
has a built in tone of this experimentation. Finding varieties of tone is not the research but  
efforts to re-examine and re-enunciate the tone is. This has been my view.

Prof. Misra,



This email list is not intended to be a class to the young students.



\>A statement does not become knowledge through its enunciation or citation



----- Most of the threads in lists such as thisbegin withreference and bibliographicalseeking posts and other members help the seeking member with the information sought. Neither party has intentions or objectives of knowledge creation.



The chillies thread referred to by you had such a reference seeking question:



want to know from this forum that "Are chillies really not indian in  
origin" i.e. were they introduced by Moghul or British or are there  
descriptions of chilli available in ancient Indian literatures  
(specifically puranas, itihasas, Vedas, etc).





Discussions on lists can be with various purposes, one of them being guidance seeking just as in he case of Chillies thread the initiator said:



During our fixing menu for our gurukula in Gujarat, a discussion came  
that chillies are not indian in origin and thus it is better that we  
avoid it. Pepper seems to be a good alternative. But chilli has a  
specific taste that pepper cannot replace.  

List members keep checking if there is any deviation from the initial question just as Dr Bhat did in Chillies thread.



Once Prof. Aklujkar provided his characteristic approach guidance, many expressed their appreciation of the respectable words.



\>We did not see a single posting on the medical and clinical value of the chilies



---- This is not true. There were posts on how Ayurveda recognizes the medical and clinical value of the chilies.



\> India has to come out of the mode of faith-healing to understand the dignity of the faith.



------ Ayurveda is not faith healing.



The present thread is on whether creating Indian Indologists /South Asianists who can provide aninsider's view of Indian literature and culture from Indian universities /institutes requires a rethinking on the funding strategies of the Indian funding agencies.
