Dear scholar friends,  
  

I am writing this note in the spirit of various announcements that occasionally  

get posted in BVP. At various times I have written here about the undergraduate  
education and the lack of analytic resources for the understanding of India and her  
culture for the children of the immigrants. I had written about our Story of Sanskrit  

project that some of you blessed. I am grateful to the knowledge I gain through my participation in this forum.  
  

Realizing that India has a larger signature in the world than Sanskrit, we have  
assembled a team that plans to build a large education-cum-activity center  
complex in Boston. Called "India Discovery Center" it has its first event scheduled  

for next week to tally with the centenary of Gandhi's return to India.
Some preliminary  

details about the effort is given in **<http://www.indiadiscoverycenter.org>**  

Please feel free to write to me personally if you have questions.
Participation  
is possible through research, writing, discoveries and creating teaching material.  
You can also suggest any possible partnership in India or elsewhere. I did meet  
officials at Sri Aurobindo Society during my visit there last summer. 
We have to  
build up a strong international analytic team.  
  

Best regards,  

Bijoy Misra
