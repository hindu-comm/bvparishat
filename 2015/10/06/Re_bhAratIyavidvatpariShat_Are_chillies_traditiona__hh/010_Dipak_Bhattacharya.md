\<I have one more query related to this - whenever word "marica" comes  
in the ayurveda, Mahabharata, Ramayana, etc. why do we translate it as  
black pepper? Can't it mean chilli? \>  

If this question has already been answered by someone please ignore the following.  

The early use of marica could not mean pepper because chilli was introduced into Europe by the Spaniards who brought it from the New World.
