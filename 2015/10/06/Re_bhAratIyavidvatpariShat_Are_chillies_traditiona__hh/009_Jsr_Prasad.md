Namaste.

Could the devotees tell any reason for its non use in their houses or temples. You may please share if it is known.

I heard about an adage in Ayurveda - 'यस्य देशप्रसूतस्य तज्जं तस्यौषधं हितम् ।' I think, the message is clear. ओषधं may mean all edible things. So, it is up to us whether to follow this dictum or not, based on one's karma and dharma. The word '**हित**' in the sentence can be correlated with the adjectival use of the 'हित-' in another expression of Vagbhata:  
  

नित्यं **हिता**हार-विहारसेवी समीक्ष्यकारी विषयेष्वसक्तः ।  

दाता समः सत्यपरः क्षमावान् आप्तोपसेवी च भवत्यरोगः ।।  
  

Dharmashastra might have prohibited foods of foreign origin, based on possible negative guṇa predominance. Rajas and tamas both are said to be the doṣas of mind. Only sattva is the guṇa positively attributed to the mind. Hence, the BG suggested - आयुस्सत्त्वबलारोग्य... (17.8). Foods that predominantly give rise to rajas and tamas are to be avoided if one wants to be a sāttvika. Hence Chandogya says - आहारशुद्धौ सत्त्वशुद्धिः सत्त्वशुद्धौ धृवा स्मृतिः ।

Sir, what difference is achieved by translating marica to chilli? Ultimately you refer to and may use the ingredient 'marica' only no. Any way, I can't comment more on this with my little knowledge. Anandakanda lists the synonyms of marica as following: मरिचः, मलैनम्, श्यामः, वेल्लजः, तीक्ष्णः, ऊषणः, यवनेष्टः, शीरिवृन्तः, सुवन्तः and चर्मबन्धनः । You may see that one of the synonyms refer to its colour -'blackness.' Out of the five pharmaco-dynamics of the marica, it's 'प्रभाव' said to be of killing the harmful bacteria/worms in the stomach - म्रियन्ते जन्तवोऽनेनेति वा, म्रियते जिह्वा अनेन इति मरिचम् ।  
  

I have a question. Have you thought of lemon instead of tamarind in your menu? I just overheard that tamarind has its historical roots in tropical African origin. Do not know whether it can also be the other way round.
