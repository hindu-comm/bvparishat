Dear Dr. Bhat,  
This thread which has 50 messages another thread has 60 messages. I hope readers will be able to make sense from such long threads. I am aware of today's date thanks. A thread is not time bound. I made this note keeping the readers in mind. Even after 30 or more posts if a thread initiator is not satisfied then the discussion can continue with specific scholars off line if the scholar agrees and a summary can be posted.  
  

A I mentioned in my previous message discussion can continue you may certainly post if you have more to say  

  

Regards
