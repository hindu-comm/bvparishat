They said that the idea is "it is safe to follow what has already been  
followed for generations. In introducing something new there may be a  
chance that it is not proper."

This is a good reference. But then in India also black pepper is not  
grown everywhere and so are some other spices. But there was a  
tradition of transporting spices (black pepper etc) all over India by  
banjaras. So is case for many other things. So it may not be the  
principle applied on everthing but the major consumables like grains,  
fruits and vegetables.
