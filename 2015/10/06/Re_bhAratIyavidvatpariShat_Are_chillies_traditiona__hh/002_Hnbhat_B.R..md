Sorry for the typo. Please "if" for "it" in the above sentence.

  

If the starter is not satisfied with the discussion, I agree with JSR, that it could continue till the time he is satisfied fully, even if the discussion do not add anything for new for the readers.

  

Only the quoting could be shortened than quoting all the previous messages, than the one which is replied so that the readers do not get bored of scrolling the whole web page to go to the next page through the quoted messages in each reply in many messages. I do not mean every members, but I find some.
