Dear Vidvaj-janas,  

  
\>\> And the motive of the question that it should be banned in India  

Sorry, if this message was communicated, I didn't mean that. Avoiding  
it was just a personal consideration and not the matter of discussion  
on this forum.  
  
As far as Chilli's non-inidian origin, most of us are agreeing either  
from modern sources or from vedic sources. Thus in one sense this  
question is answered.  
  
Some observations to add to it:  
I asked to a group of Pusti Marga devotees (Vallabhacarya Sampradaya)  
living in villages and very old. They remember that in their village  
no one used chillies neither it was accepted to be offered in temples.  
I also asked a few devotees in madhva sampradaya and they said that  
although there is red chilli used in Udupi Krsna Matha currently but  
it is not an old practice.  
  
I think these sources (including those giving in this whole  
converstation or thread) are sufficient to understand that chilli's  
were not used (or rarely used) in ancient Indian society.  
  
To include or not include chillies in the menu of our gurukula depends  
on a few other factors and I am not going to discuss them here unless  
it needs some valuable inputs from scholars. I started this thread not  
just to blindly follow "Indianism" but to just get information from  
the vast body of good scholars all over India - otherwise I would have  
to myself collect it from various sources which is very cumbersome.  
This is the benefit of sharing knowledge over this group.  
  
I have one more query related to this - whenever word "marica" comes  
in the ayurveda, Mahabharata, Ramayana, etc. why do we translate it as  
black pepper? Can't it mean chilli? Or is there some other name also  
specifically used for black pepper which is clarified in some ancient  
commentaries? Or are there morphological characteristics of marica  
mentioned in sastras due to which we translate it as black pepper?  
  
I thank all scholars to participate in this discussion and some good  
points came out of this.
