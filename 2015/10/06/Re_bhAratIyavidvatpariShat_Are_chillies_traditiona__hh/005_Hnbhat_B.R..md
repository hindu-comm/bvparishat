Certainly I do not have to make any additional information to add to already overgrown thread, in response to the simple question:

  

" I want to know from this forum that "Are chillies really not indian in

origin" i.e. were they introduced by Moghul or *British or are there*

*descriptions of chilli available in ancient Indian literatures*

*(specifically puranas, itihasas, Vedas, etc)."*

  

It is not Indian origin as aleady the questioner knew and references so far provided did not refer to any other vairety than the pepper. No distinction between black pepper (supposedly Indian Origin) is referred or the chilli is not made clear. And so this will continue. I myself do not the answer. All the description provided the quality of probably one Black Pepper. but the reference to whether chilli or black-pepper is not made anywhere clear nor their botanical description or varieties described in any the descriptions, as he has asked for. But everything in Ayurveda.

  

The first question has been answered in a way, the history of chilley, its derivation in English, and probably their introduction in India (which I do not remember, among the multitude of responses). 

  

And the motive of the question that it should be banned in India, due to its foreign origin. To this basic question, Prof.Ashok Aklujkar has precisely replied in the first paragraph itself:

  

  

1\. *Ancient Indians do not seem have shunned something because of a thing’s known or probable foreign origin (recall: Yavana-jātaka or -siddhānta,* praising Mlecchas for their skill in making yantras, pronouncements like ā no bhadrāḥ kratavo yantu viśvataḥ).  

  

No specific prohibition like "न कलञ्जं भक्षयेत् in MS.6.2.19-2. ŚB. 1.1.4."

  

or "पञ्च पञ्चनखा भक्ष्याः' इत्यत्र पञ्चानां पञ्चनखप्राणिनां भक्षणनियमे तदितरेषां पञ्चनखानां भक्षणप्रतिषेधः

  

are cited for banning chille from scriptures.

  

All others are debated at length.
