This is not true. Damodara Dasa started this thread in September,

[damoda...@gmail.com]() via [googlegroups.com](http://googlegroups.com)

Sep 21

  

It is not yet October 21 to be a month, it the duration of the thread is limited to one month. And people continue to put information they collect as long as they could collect information. So in both ways, there could not be a limit of duration or length for a thread unless the members realize the purpose the started thread is fullfilled by the discrussions.
