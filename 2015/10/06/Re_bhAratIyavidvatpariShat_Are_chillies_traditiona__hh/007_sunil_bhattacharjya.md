Namaste,  
  

It appears that it has not been conclusively proved that Chillii has been brought to Asis from outside. It could have been the other way round. You can see the following in Wikipedia :really  

\<<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chili_pepper>\>

In 1995 archaeobotanist Hakon Hjelmqvist published an article in Svensk Botanisk Tidskrift claiming there was evidence for the presence of chili peppers in Europe in pre-Columbian times.\[14\] According to Hjelmqvist, archaeologists at a dig in St. Botulf in Lund found a Capsicum frutescens in a layer from the 13th century. Hjelmqvist thought it came from Asia. Hjelmqvist also said that *Capsicum* was described by the Greek Theophrastus (370–286 BCE) in his *Historia Plantarum,* and in other sources. Around the first century CE, the Roman poet Martialis (Martial) mentioned "Piperve crudum" (raw pepper) in Liber XI, XVIII, allegedly describing them as long and containing seeds (a description which seems to fit chili peppers - but could also fit the long pepper, which was well known to ancient Romans).

Reference \[14\] : Hjelmqvist, Hakon. "Cayennepeppar från Lunds medeltid". Svensk Botanisk Tidskrift, vol 89. pp.193–.

There are such a bewildering varieties of chillies in India, including the varieties such as the black-coloured chillies and the chillies which grow pointing to the sky (and some jocularly call it as the anti-gravity chilli) in addition to Chillies from Bhoot-Jolokia (the hottest Chillies) to kon-jolokia (the mini-Chillies) that one has to check whether such chillies are available outside India, for the sake of knowing the truth and not necessarily fron the Indianism angle.
