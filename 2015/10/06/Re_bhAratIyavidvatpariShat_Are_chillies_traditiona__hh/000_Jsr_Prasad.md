Dear Ajit ji, a beautiful sum up came through Prof. Aklujkar and a nice pointer from Prof. Kannan, even after your note. As the original poster would like to continue the discussion, does not it look proper to go ahead with the discussion. The thread was started on 21st September '15. I think, as long as there is no objectionable content posted, the discussion can continue. This is my opinion. Thanks.
