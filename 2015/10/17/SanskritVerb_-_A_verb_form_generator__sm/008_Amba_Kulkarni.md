Namaskar Sir.  
  

Just now I tested it on my mobile which has android in it, and through chrome I could access the website. I could get the morphological analysis. Though I should admit it was a bit slow.  
  

Will you please tell me the device you are using?  
  

With regards,  

Amba Kulkarni
