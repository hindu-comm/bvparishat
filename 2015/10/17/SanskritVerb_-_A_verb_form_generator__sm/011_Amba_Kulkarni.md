Thank you Sir for the information.  
  

Regarding the Devanagari display: Is it with only this website, or in general Devanagari is not displayed properly?  

If it is only with this website, do you see the the Devanagari in the menu (साधनानि, कोशाः, प्रकाशनानि, etc.) or not?  

  

Regarding analyser and other tools: Pl check whether you have set 'all sites to run javascript' option, under  

edit -> preferences -> settings -> privacy settings -> content settings.  
  

With regards,  

Amba Kulkarni
