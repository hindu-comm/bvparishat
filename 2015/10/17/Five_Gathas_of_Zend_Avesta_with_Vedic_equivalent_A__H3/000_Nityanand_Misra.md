Dear list members

  

Please find attached a flier on a publication on the five [Gathas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gathas) of the [Zend Avesta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avesta). The Gathas was translated into Vedic, complete with accents, by the Gujarati poet [Ardeshar Khabardar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ardeshar_Khabardar) in the early 20^(th) century, and published along with an English translation by Khabardar. Last year, Bhuvan Vani Trust published the Anvaya with a word-for-word meanings in Hindi and a Hindi translation of the Gathas based on Khabardar’s English translation. The Anvaya and Hindi translation is done by Dr. Shilanand Hemraj. The second page of the PDF shows a sample page with the original Gatha text of Yasna 28:1, the Vedic equivalent, the Anvaya and the translation.

  

The work can be had from the publishers Bhuvan Vani Trust whose contact details are in the flier.
