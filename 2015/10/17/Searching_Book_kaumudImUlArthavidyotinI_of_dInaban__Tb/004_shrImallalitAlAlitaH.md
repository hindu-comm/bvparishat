Correct.

But, note that this specific book was not available at publishers or any other seller. A few scholars have it, and I was requesting them for fast 6 years and they just promised and ignored. In that case, this is the only source.  

Once it is in our hand and we decide that it is out of copyright, a scan will be put online. Otherwise, purchasing this is the only option.

  

I've also seen that those who want to help scholar community by scanning books, are ignoring copyright and even not attributing the book to original author. For example, khaNDanakhaNDakhAdya with shAradA commentary was put online as soon as it came in hands of these people without considering that it hurts sales of this book which was prepared by and elderly shcolar by spending years of his life. One of my books in draft which was shared personally with someone, was made public by similar people.

  

So, wrongdoing is everywhere. To solve one, we must not support the wrong of other type.
