Om,

The book was received today.

As I guessed, the price quoted by ExoticIndia is same as was printed on the book in 1986. They didn't put any sticker, they didn't ask any more money.

The packging was very good. The book is very old and fragile.

  

The commentary is available on very small portion. Up to ह्रस्वग्रहणमतन्त्रम् was edited by the author in his old age before his गोलोकगमन. The full extent of book is from मुनित्रयं नमस्कृत्य to अजादौ सर्व्वादिः. Then it starts from प्रथमा and ends in षष्ठी in the कारकप्रकरणम्. The कौमुदी part ends with this.

  

The commentary was written in 1926 and published in 1986.

The author existed between 1878-1955.

  

There are few articles by पण्डितदीनबन्धुझा added as परिशिष्टम् .Their titles are कार्य्यासिद्धत्वसमर्त्थनखण्डनं , स्थानिवदादेशोनल्विधौ , अन्तादिवत्सूत्रव्याख्या , साहित्यपदार्त्थनिरुक्तिः , शूद्रा च इत्यस्य शेखरानुसारिव्याख्या , प्रवृत्तिनिमित्तलक्षणम् .

  

18 works of the author are mentioned in भूमिका. Those related to व्याकरण are - वैयाकरणभूषणसारदीपिका , समासशक्तिदीपिका , उपसृष्टधात्वर्त्थसङ्ग्रहः , लिङ्गवचनविचारः , पाणिनीयव्याकरणतत्त्वप्रदीपः , etc.
