SAdara praNAm,

Our society considerably lacks civic sense. Few seem to respect the rights and privilegesof others. Even highly learned amongus unscrupulously indulge in

illegal activities like that were described in your letter. This character of an Indian is one of the reasons for foreigners looking down at us. A further deplorable attitude is that we go on accusing foreigners as A*chAra heena*and hence uncultured instead of appreciating their high concern for the liberty of others.

A text with Copyright should not be put online as it will be illegal. The idea is to set up a digital library by BVP from the contributions of digital materials from members. Only the necessary part of a title that is required by a member should be provided for a nominal payment that can be utilized for day-to-day expenses of the library.

In my preliminary Sanskrit classes, some interesting SAropadesas were taught. A very important one that I always remember is*"Pusthakam vanitha vitham parahasthagatham gatham"*So never give a book to others however great he is! If sharing is unavoidable give only an essential portion and never full text of course!

Namaste.
