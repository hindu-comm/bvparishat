Namaste Sivanar Ji  

Thank you for advise to scholars on this mailing list who are authors and holders of copyright themselves. I am writing not to enter into any debate. Lets not advise what others should be doing. If your rights are violated you may take recourse to remedy in this case if you are the copyright holder. only. No one is sharing any copyrighted material here on this list.

  

A scholar looks for hundreds of articles and books. The copywrite act has fair usage. Questions on availability of books or for extracts from books should be welcomed on any mailing list. Never give books so what about libraries or publishers who don't make their books readily available. The book in question here is a an old book but under copyright. In this case one has to write to Kameshwar Singh Darbhanga Sanskrit University, Bihar to check if they hold the copyright or is it with the author for reproduction. If they have a copy them may even supply a photocopy at their discretion or might ask the reader to buy the book if it is available with them.

Thank you

Ajit Gargeshwari
