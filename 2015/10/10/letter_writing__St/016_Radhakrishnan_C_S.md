Dear Scholars,

I wish to add in this context that there is a unique Genre of friendly Epistle, particularly in Buddhist literature, called the Suhrllekha. Works, such as Ratnavali of Nagarjuna, Sisyalekha of Candragomin, Maharaja Kanishka Lekha of Matrcheta, Kumaralekha of Bhikshuprakasa, Bhotasvamidasagurulekha of Acharya Karmalasila, Candrarajalekha of Jaganmitrananda, Vimalaratnalekha of Dipankarasrijnana and so on. Those who are interested to know about this Genre may please read my article "Suhrllekha - The Buddhist Genre of Friendly Epistle", Contribution of Buddhism to World Culture, Somaiya Publications Pvt. Ltd, Mumbai, 2006.

  

With regards,

  

C.S.Radhakrishnan
