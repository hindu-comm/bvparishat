The following publications should be useful”

Sen, Surendranath and Umesh Mishra. 1951. Sanskrit Documents, Being Sanskrit Letters and Other Documents preserved in the Oriental Collection at the National Archives of India. Published on behalf of the National Archives of India by the Ganganatha Jha Research Institute, Allahabad.

Manuscripts of a work titled Patra-lekhana orPatra-lekhana-paddhati/vidhi are listed in the catalogues or hand-written sūcis of some collections; e.g. the L.D. Institute library. I vaguely remember having seen it in a published form. Perhaps Prof. Siddharth Wakankar will be able to tell if my recollection is correct.
