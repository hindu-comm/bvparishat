Namaskar to all.

Apart from Patrakaumudi of Vararuci, there are other texts which tell about the letter writing. The Patrapariksha by Vidyananda Suri was published Benares in 1913. One more text named as Prasastikasika or Patraprasasti by Balakrishna Tripathin published from VVRI. Hoshiarpur in 1967, being edited by Prof. K.V. Sarma. It deals with writing the prasastis as part of the letter.

Thank you all
