Dear all  
  

I am looking for the exact details, like publication year etc of a book Muktavali (probably Nyayasiddhanta Muktavali of Visvanatha) Commentary or Edited By Rajendra Chandra Sastrin  
  

I found quoting this book in A History of Indain Logic by Satis Chandra Vidyabhusana Motilal Banarassidas Page 404 footnotes.  
  
  

Regards  

  
KP
