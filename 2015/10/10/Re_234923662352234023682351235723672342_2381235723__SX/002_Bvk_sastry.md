Prof. Deshpande stated about the long history if language classification and linguistics debate in indian schools much before colonial linguistics.

  

The point to note here is this: what was the focus of language debate in indian context?

In my understanding , there are two threads of deliberation. One, Spiritual sacred linguistics which keeps focus on vedic and Paninian Sanskrit. Second, social languages in indian society.

  

Indian linguists never mixed up these two streams. Colonial linguists make an unspecified mix and mess of both these streams and add the spice of degenerative language models of tribal societies. The anchor used is historic evolution of languages and use of english likeness for standard of measure.

  

The question: is there any indian school of linguistics which would consider, analyze, debate on merits of such a mix of language modeling?

  

Thanks for help in understanding this key issue.
