As the scholars shed light in the present thread on the historicity of Indian languages in an interesting manner and after observing some of the statements in the progressive discussion I think of placing some of the questions, that struck to mind, for the discussion and verification of their validity from the present point of view.

  

1. Should any language need to bear different labels like spiritual language, social language and so on? or Can it be accepted if said that the same language is used for different purposes? Or is it just Purpose oriented classification for the convenience of phenomenal identity?

  

2. Are The Vedas exclusively spiritual in entirety? or Can we or Can't we accept them as the early sources of different disciplines of knowledge of human world or at least of Bharata Varsha?

  

3. Was it not true to say that Patnajali in his Mahabhashya discussed on different dialects of Sanskrit?

  

4. Weren't there any discussions to come across on the use of Pali, Prakrit and other languages by Bauddhas and Jainas in the pre-Christian Era to propagate their doctrines to reach people?

  

5. Weren't there any works on the Grammars to languages other than Sanskrit in the Pre-Christian Era?

  

6. Weren't there any treatises written on different non-spiritual subjects or topics in languages other than Sanskrit in pre-Christian Era?

  

7. In which language records say that Gunadhya Pandita wrote Brahatkatha having taken a vow not to use Sanskrit for his literary exercises? If other languages weren't existing and if the knowledge of such languages was not popularly known to all why and how did his chose an unpopular language?

  

8. Before the advent of Devanagari records say that there was the habit of writing Sanskrit Treatises in different Scripts in different regions of our Country. Here the doubt is - Were all these scripts meant for writing Sanskrit treatises only or to deal with other languages also? If these scripts belong to different other languages also can it encourage us to say that our ancient people had good and systematic knowledge of different other regional languages also.?

  

9. In the Natya Sastra of Bharata and in the early and later works on Ancient Indian Dramaturgy while dealing with the nature of various characters language restriction according the characters' propriety is every where prescribed. Was it a casual or accidental exercise of the the writers of our Ancient Indian Dramaturgy to specify various characters or to use various languages and dialects?

  

10. Were the statements of Sriharsha in Naishadhiya Charita of Sri Harsha and Kadambari of Bana about Bahubhasha Parijnanam are just worthy of poetic fancies and of their imaginative freedom or were there any thought to support that those people had such wonderful multilingual knowledge?

  

11. Visvanatha Kaviraja, the author of Sahitya Darpana, declares himself as the knower of 18 languages other than Sanskrit. How much value can be assigned to his statement?

  

12. Should we vow much exclusively to the western linguists and their Indian followers for enlightening us in connection with the existence of many languages on par with Sanskrit also in Ancient India?

  

These are a few questions, I request the scholars, to find answers for enlightening people like me.

Warm regards,
