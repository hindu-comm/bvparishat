Hare Krishna.  
Dear Vidvajjanas,  
I wanted to know if there is vedic origin to famous surya namaskara process.  
  
Also in the surya namaskara, was it performed in front of the sun  
exposing oneself to sun or inddoors? Also the recommended time for  
surya namaskara was early in the morning (just at sunrise)?  
  
Thankyou,  
Damodara Das
