Hare Krishna.  
  
Dear Sunil Bhattacaryaji,  

  
\>\> Do you want to say that Manu was wrong and the modern science also is wrong and that 3 to 4 hours of exposure of human skin to the Sun would not have any ill-effect ? If you say so, then let us agree to disagree.  
  

Sorry, if I passed a wrong information. My point is that as Manu  
cannot be wrong, thus apparent contradiction in instructions need to  
be properly understood in order to apply them.  
  
Regarding farmers wearing clothes, usually in early morning (fist half  
from about 6:00 to 10:00 am) they do not wear clothes (especially the  
upper garment). It is a normal practice in tamilnadu that farmers only  
wear kaupina as clothes makes it very uncomfortable to do heavy  
physical work and also it increases heat inside the body as the heat  
produced due to heavy work doesn't get dissipated. The farmers that I  
have seen in my 9 years carrier in about 40 villages work bare chest  
and with minimal clothes in the morning time. It is only when they  
need to work beyond 10:00 am that they cover their head (and sometimes  
chest) by some cloth to save from direct heavy sunlight.  
  
Thankyou,  
Damodara Das
