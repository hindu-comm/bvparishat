Hare Krishna.  
  
History of this thread:  
  
1. Started with question on Surya Namaskara that whether the current  
practice of it being exposed to Sun mentioned in vedas or puranas.  
2. Then it went on to discuss that as it is prohibited by Manu (4.69)  
to avoid bAlAtapa, thus surya-namaskara may not be performed exposed  
to sun.  
3. Thus I caught up this point to discuss the injunction of Manu to  
avoid bAlAtapa as this was the main reason for me to put the question  
of surya-namaskara at first place. Thus the main question has now  
become --  
"Manu Smrti (and other smrtis also) mentions to avoid bAlAtapa (early  
morning sun) and the tradition at all places in India is seen not to  
follow this instruction. Also other injunctions in smrtis as well as  
vedas are not in line with avoiding bAlAtapa. I gave a few examples  
that of arghya, pratah-sandhya, farmers, etc. Thus as there appears  
contradiction there is need of discussion to resolve it."  
  
Background: Question came up as we give morning sunbath and  
surya-namaskara to children in gurukula and while reading Manu Smrti  
this contradiction arose so as to decide our action.  
  
Thankyou,
