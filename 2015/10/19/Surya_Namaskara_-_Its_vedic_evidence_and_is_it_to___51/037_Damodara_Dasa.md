Is the consideration for closing a thread no. of posts? If so then any  
good topic needs much more discussion than 30 posts. It should then be  
a bigger number.  
  
In my humble opinion, the thread needs closure when all points are  
exhausted and no more new points are added but the discussion just  
goes on in to the loops with no hope of solution.  
  
Thankyou,  
Damodara Das
