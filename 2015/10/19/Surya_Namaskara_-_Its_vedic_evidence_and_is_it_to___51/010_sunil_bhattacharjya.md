I think there is an anecdote in Purana (I do not recollect the exact details now) that one should be careful about exposing oneself to the Sun. Once Gautama rishi's wife fainted while going to collect water from a river under the hot Sun and the rishi wanted to curse the Sungod for that. The Sungod appeared and asked him not to curse him, as his rays are needed for the good of the world. The Sungod gave one umbrella and a pair of slippers to the rishi so that the rishis wife can use these for going in the hot Sun. Even the modern science advises one not to expose oneself in the Sun not more than 10 to 15 minutes.  
  

Coming to the farmers, I understand that in the eastern India, the farmers go out for ploughing early at dawn, sometime around 4.30 am and return home after about 3 to 4 hours, so that they do not expose themselves to the hot Sun. In Assam the farmers use a huge Sun-hat called "Jaapi" for protection in rain and Sun.  
  

All these go to show that blanket permission to expose oneself to the morning Sun might not have been given in the ancient past. Added to this is the coldness one would feel if the one removes upper clothes for Sun-bath. if that is done in the morning. That also could be the reason for preferring the evening Sun for Sun-bath.
