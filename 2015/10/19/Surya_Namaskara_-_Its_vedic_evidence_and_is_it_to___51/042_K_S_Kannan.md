As to the exposure to the Sun.

Hunting expeditions involve a good deal of exposure to the solar rays. Withstanding the same (and that in a tropical country as ours), was considered a point of merit, for at least a ks"atriya.

  

Such was, kAlidAsa describes, the frame of king dus"yanta : ****ravi-kirana-sahis"Nu* kles'a-les'air abhinnam**.*

  

As to the seraglio of our kings, little exposure would the queens have to the Sun :

***a-sUryam-pas'yAH rAja-striyaH !***
