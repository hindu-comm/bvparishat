Dear friends,  
  

In the previous mail one word "heat" was left out by mistake. Kindly read the following :

  
  
"Asआतप means it is clear that by using the word वालातप Manu is referring to morning Sun-bat"h  
  

**corrected as follows:**  
  
**Asआतप means heat it is clear that by using the word वालातप Manu is referring to morning Sun-bath**  
  

Regards,  

Sunil KB
