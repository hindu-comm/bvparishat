Dear Sunil Ji,  
  
Mahamahopadhyaya Giridhar Sharma Chaturvedi Ji of Kashi once mentioned that arghya to surya saves from such problems.  
  
During the hours of sunrise and sunset, there is a tendency in the mayUkha (kiraNa) of Aditya of getting refracted. Hence, sun gazing & exposure during those moments is prohibited.  
  
Hence, sandhya worship and arghya to sUrya is prescribed. The arghya should be offered facing the sun. This mitigates the effect of refracted sun rays on the person who offers arghya.  
  
It is to be noted that sandhyavandana and arghya is prescribed for all ie., for chAturvarNAs. I have seen fishermen performing sandhyavandana in the eastern coast of Andhra Pradesh near Kakinada. Early in the morning, before going for fishing in the sea, they perform sandhya, offer arghya to surya 3 times and set off for fishing.  
  
Unfortunately, this practice of sandhya and arghya pradAna has been restricted to dwijAs only.  
  
regs,  
sriram
