I understand that one of the sages in Sringeri had an incurable skin disease, and he got it cured by performing Suryanamaskara in the early morning Sun, for one thousand days. Probably one should not look at the Sun directly as the adage : पृष्ठतः सेवयेद् अर्कं जठरेण हुताशनम्
says. However in the early morning the Sun's UV rays are highly attenuated and very brief exposure to it may not be harmful to the eyes.  
  
One of the sons of Lord Krishna also had a similar skin disease and he was cured by worshipping the Sun but the details are not known.
