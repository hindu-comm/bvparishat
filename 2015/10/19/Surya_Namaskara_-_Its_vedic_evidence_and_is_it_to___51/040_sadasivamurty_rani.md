Dear Scholars!

Namamsi Bhuyamsi!

This is an essential discussion going on Suryanamaskarams.

Not to contradict any scholars but to share my experiences and my inherited Ayurvedic knowledge related to this thread I make a humble attempt here.

Three points I would like to present in this attempt.1. Ayurvedic Souorces 2. Vedic Sources and 3. My own experience and experiments

**1. AYURVEDIC SOURCES:**

The rays of the Sun are not alike in all the seasons. They are not alike in all the hours of the DAY also. They vary from hour to hour and season to season also. So during all the hours his influence on is not the same and not acceptable too.

The following are the timings to metaphorically measure the age of the Sun during a Day.

1\. **Balarka** from the Sunrise to 7.00AM. Should not spend much time under such Sun. This Sun sheds **Ultra Violet Rays (UV Rays)**.

2\. **Tarunarka** from 7.00AM to 9.00AM. This is acceptable (Particularly the time between 7.00AM to 8.00AM). During this time we can get D Vitamin in abundance. For Vegetarians the only D Vitamin Source is the morning SUN rays between 7.00AM to 8.00AM. During this time also we can lay under the SUN only for 10 to 15 minutes. This time should not be exceeded.

If a person stays for more time under such Sun it results in **SUNTAN**.



3\. **Madhyarka** - The Midday Sun. Not at all Good. Causes **Sun Burns**.

4\. **Praudharka** - The Sun between 4.30 AM to 5.00AM as good as Tarunarka.

5\. **Vrddharka** - The setting Sun. Also not Good. Again is the source of UV rays.



Now let us see what Ayurveda Says about these:

1\. उद्यन्तमस्तमायान्तं तपन्तं प्रतिमागतम्।

उपरक्तं च भास्वन्तं वाससा वा तिरोहितम् ॥

नोच्छिष्टातारकारहुतुहिनांशुदिवाकरान्।

पश्येन्नयायात् .................॥ - अष्टाङ्गसङ्ग्रहे तृतीयॆऽध्याये ।

Here it is strictly prohibited to see the Sun during Sunrise, Midday and Sunset. Besides during the Solar Eclipse and also such Sun who is covered by any cloth.



2\. In the following passage from the sixth Adhyaya of Sutrasthanam of Sushruta Samhita the relation between the behavioral patterns of the herbs, water, Three Human humors under the influence the changing nature of the Sun are well explained. And respective possible diseases as a result of the receptive behavioral patterns also are specified.



वर्षास्वोषधयस्तरुण्योऽल्पवीर्या आपश्चाप्रशान्ता: क्षितिमलप्राया:।



ता उपयुज्यमाना: नभसि मेघावतते जलक्लिन्नायां भूमौ क्लिन्नदेहानां प्राणिनां शीतवातविष्टाम्भिताग्नीनां विदह्यन्ते। विदाहाट़् पित्तसंचयमापादयन्ति।



स संचय: शरदि प्रविरलमेघे वियत्युपश्ष्यति पङ्के अर्ककिरणप्रविलायित: पैत्तिकाऩ् व्याधीन् जनयन्ति।



ता एवौषधय: कालपरिणामात् परिणतवीर्या बलवत्यो हेमन्ते भवन्त्यापश्च प्रशान्ता: स्निग्धा: अत्य्रर्थं गुर्व्यश्च, ता उपयुज्यमाना मन्दकिरण्त्वाभानॊ: सतुषरपवनोपस्तम्भितदेहानां देहिनामविदग्धा: स्नेहाच्च्छैत्याद् गौरवादुपलेपाच्च श्लेष्मसंचयमापादयन्ति।



स संचयो वसन्ते‍ऽर्करश्मिप्रविलायित ईषत्स्तब्धदेहानां देहिनां श्लैष्मिकान् व्याधीन् जनयति। ता एवौषधयो निदाघे नि:सारा रूक्षा अतिमात्रं लघ्व्यो भवन्त्यापश्च। ता उपयुज्यमाना सूर्यप्रतापोपशोषितदेहानां देहिनां रौक्ष्यालघुत्वाच्च वायो: संचयमापादयन्ति।



स संचय: प्रावृषि चात्यर्थं जलोपक्लिन्नायां भूमौ क्लिन्नदेहानां देहिनां शीतवातवर्षेरितो वातिकान् व्यधीन् जनयन्ति। एवमेष दॊषाणां संचयप्रकोपहेतुरुक्त:। सुश्रुतसंहितायां सूत्रस्थाने ६ अध्यये सूत्रम्११



Very interestingly the effects of all the six seasons are said to be observable in every Ahoratra also.

तत्र, पूर्वाह्णे वसन्तस्य लिङ्गं, मध्याह्ने ग्रीष्मस्य, अपराह्णे प्रावृष:, प्रदोषे वार्षिकं , शारदमर्धरात्रे, प्रत्युशसि हैमन्तमुपलक्षयेत्। एवमहोरात्रमपि वर्षमिव शीतॊष्णवर्षलक्षणं दॊषॊपचयप्रकॊपोपशमैर्जानीयात्। सुश्रुतसंहितायां सूत्रस्थाने ६ अध्यये सूत्रम्१४

**THESE ARE NOT ARTHAVADA VAKYAS. THESE ARE STRICT AYURVEDIC RECOMMENDATIONS.**

  

**2. VEDIC SOURCES:**

We know as specified by the previous scholars in the Taittiriya Aranyaka of Krishna Yajurveda the first Prasna is popularly known as ARUNAM.

  

Suryanamaskarams are associated with this ARUNAM portion. These Suryanamaskarams' postures are different from the set of the Yoga Asanas known among the people in the name of Surya Namaskarams.

  

These Suryanamaskarams postures resemble Sashtanga Danda Pranamas but are more systematic and procedural. The recommended and ideal time for practising these Namaskarams is between 7.00AM to 9.00 AM. They are repeatedly performed in 40 days circles till the problem is cured.

  

These Suryanamaskarams, as in the experience of several people, is curative of many dermatological problems, cardiovascular problems and brain related problems.

  

The observations support that the effect is due to the constant neuro-phonetic inter action.

The set of ARUNAM Suyrya Namaskarams can be see in the attachment of this mail.

  

**3. MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE** : 

In the year 2010 I was affected by the dermatological complaint of

DE-PIGMENTATION. There was a great loss of Melanin.

As a result several parallel patterns of white patches on both left and right sides spread all over my body. Doctors were not sure of the cure of this problem. They said that it spreads fast and cure is very slow and it is also by chance only.

  

Then in some Ayurvedic Texts and in some Mantra Sastra Texts I found certain

practices prescribed. Accordingly I prepared my own medicine and have been using it standing under Sun. Whenever I stood between 9.00AM to 12.00 Noon or 3.00PM to 4.00 PM the problem was aggravating. 

But whenever I was standing under the Sun between 7.00AM to 8.00AM (Just for 10 to 15 minutes only) or between 4.30PM to 5.00PM there was a very good positive result.

Now there is 90% cure of my complaint due to my regular practice of standing under the Sun between the said timings besides using the medicine and chanting certain Mantras also.

I hope this information may be useful in the present context.

With warm regards,

**Dr. Rani Sadasiva Murty**
