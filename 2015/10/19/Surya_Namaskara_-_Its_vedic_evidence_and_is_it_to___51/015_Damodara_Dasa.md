Hare Krishna.  

  
\>\> In ancient times, the brahmins went out to the river for bath and then gave arghya facing the direction of the Sun, with themselves remaining in waist-deep water. That was done pretty early in the morning.  
  

Usually, as it is uttama tarakopeta... sandhya vandanam is recommended  
to be performed at least before sunrise and one needs to finish his  
bath before sandhya vandanam. So as offering arghya is just after  
bathing it may not be exposing one to sun.  
  
Thankyou,  
Damodara Das
