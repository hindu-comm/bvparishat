## Safe level of sun exposure

According to a 2007 study submitted by the [University of Ottawa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Ottawa "University of Ottawa") to the US Department of Health and Human Services, there is not enough information to determine a safe level of sun exposure that imposes minimal risk of skin cancer.^([\[39\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_effects_of_sunlight_exposure#cite_note-ODS-sheet-ref-5-39)) In addition, there is not yet conclusive evidence on which components of ultraviolet radiation (UVA, UVB, UVC) are actually carcinogenic.^([\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_effects_of_sunlight_exposure#cite_note-13th_Report_on_Carcinogens-8)) The composition reaching the ground changes through the day and year: approximately 95% UVA and 5% UVB at high noon, shifting toward 99% UVA and 1% UVB when the sun is at a low angle in the sky.^([\[40\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_effects_of_sunlight_exposure#cite_note-40)) UVC is almost completely absorbed by the atmosphere and does not reach the surface in any appreciable quantity.^([\[41\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_effects_of_sunlight_exposure#cite_note-41)) As a result, only the broad-spectrum combination (UVA, UVB, UVC) known as "ultraviolet radiation" is listed as a carcinogen; the components are only "likely to become" known carcinogens. Solar radiation (sunlight) and sunlamps are listed as carcinogens because they contain ultraviolet radiation.^([\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_effects_of_sunlight_exposure#cite_note-13th_Report_on_Carcinogens-8))
