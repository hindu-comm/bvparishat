The discussions digressed and drifted in different directions. It would be beneficial to draw a few conclusions before closing such a long thread. My take (may be different from others) is as follows:

  

1\. सूर्योपासन is different from सूर्यनमस्कार. The latter is a physical exercise with spiritual undertones but does not have any ancient Vedic background.

  

2\. .सूर्योपासन a.k.a संध्यावन्दनम् is a Vedic practice, enjoined in the Smrti texts, with its ancient theoretical precepts found in the Taittiriya Aranyaka.

  

3\. Sandhyaa is defined quite precisely as "neither night nor day" Dharmashastra texts (ex:: Vaidyanaathiya) take great trouble to explain thatसंध्या is both a 'Time' as well as a Devataa.

  Hence the recognition of Sandhyaa as a transition period, twice daily.

4\. The rule position forसंध्यावन्दनम् is quite precise. There are two parts: Arghya-pradaana followed by Japa. As pointed out already by Prof.Korada, Arghya has to be given when stars are still seen in the morning. Gayatri Upasthaana (after Japa) has to be done after sunrise. In the evening it is the reverse. For Japa, the general prescription is: precincts of a temple, under ashvattha tree or in the house. The question of exposing oneself to the morning Sun during this Vedic rite is irrelevant.

The only possibility is in the afternoon. Here again the tradition teaches the Dwija not to look directly at Sun. पश्येम शरदश्शतम् .......सूर्यं दृशे॥ Sun is seen with the right eye but almost covering the face with the ten fingers. The corona is avoided with a special Mudra, taught during the upanayanam ceremony.
