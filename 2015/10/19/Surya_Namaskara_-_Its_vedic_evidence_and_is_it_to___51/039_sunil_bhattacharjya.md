Namaste,  
  

I really appreciate the detailed reasonings davanced by Prof. Korada. If the moderatorji permits, I will like to make a brief point, which I did not include earlier, for fear of prolonging the discussion.  
  

Prof.Koradaji rightly stated as follows;  
  

**Quote**

  
So even if people are working in the fields with कौपीनम् ( G-string) during Sun it is good for health - but too much exposure is not . If they take good food nothing happens .

**Unquote

**This is very true. A long exposure to the Sun leads to formation of "free-radical": and that could be the cause of the ill-effects. If one takes good food, including the ones, which neutralize / remove the free-radicals, the ill effects of longer exposure to the Sun can be countered to a great extent.  
  
**

**Secondly the exposure to the Sun effects different persons differently, ie. the sun-sensitivity is different for different people. Dark-skinned ones need more Sunlight that the light-skinned ones. Thus one has to balance the risk of over-exposure to the Sun, which may cause skin-cancer against the under-exposure to the Sun, which can cause deficiency of vitamin-D etc.  This is a topic by itself, if one wants to discuss it further.
