नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

Vidvan Damodara Das

  

1.So this means that everyday one will be exposed to bAlArka (or

  
bAlAtapa). But Manu Smrti (4.69) as quoted before and similar  
quotations from other smrtis advice to avoid bAlArka. Thus the need  
for discussion arose.  

  

4-69 Manu -- बालातपः वर्ज्यः

  

बलातप will be not be for long and it is to be avoided as far as possible . Even in the other स्मृति - बालार्कः आयुः क्षीणं दिने दिने - is an अर्थवाद - the real meaning is not to be taken .

  

I had been doing cultivation (both wet and dry) for 21 years and do know the problems even if I did not do work in the Sun.

  

Nowhere is it said that बालातप is carcinogenic .

  

  

2.Reframing my question:

  
Manu Smrti states to avoid bAlArka. But in tradition we find in all  
varnas that people do expose themselves to early morning sun - in  
offering arghya, snanam, working in fields, Surya namaskara, etc. Thus  
what about the above injunction of Manu Smrti (and similar injunctions  
in other smrtis).  

  

Just think carefully the वाक्यार्थ of -

  

बालातपः प्रेतधूमो वर्ज्यं भिन्नं तथासनम्

  

भृगु (in मनुस्मृति) was enumerating certain निषेधाः and in that context
he says --

  

better leave early Sun , smoke from a burial ground and a seat with cracks . So the result of all these will be similar -- साहचर्यात्

  

संयोगो विप्रयोगश्च साहचर्यं विरोधिता । .. शब्दार्थस्यानवच्छेदे विशेषस्मृतिहेतवः॥ ( वाक्यपदीयम् - वाक्यकाण्डः - मूलम् -- ’ अर्थात् प्रकरणाद्वा ’ - महाभाष्यम्) .

  

Now compare with मनुस्मृतिः - 4-37 -- नेक्षेत उद्यन्तम् आदित्यम् (
elsewhere - सर्वथेक्षेत नादित्यम् )

  

Here it is विधिलिङ् - one should not stare at rising Sun .

  

So there is gulf of difference between the two - the second one is very harmful and therefore should be avoided at all costs whereas the first one is better to avoid (वर्ज्यम् - वर्जितुम् योग्यम् -- ’ अर्हे कृत्यतृचश्च’ पा ) .

  

Any sentence has to be understood in terms of पदवाक्यप्रमाणशास्त्रs .

  

Sometimes it means - अति सर्वत्र वर्जयेत् । Just look at these examples --  

  

घृतेन वर्धते बुद्धिः क्षीरेणायुष्यवर्धनम् ।

**शाकेन वर्धते व्याधिः** मासं मांसेन वर्धते ॥

  

अभुक्त्वामलकं पथ्यं भुक्त्वा तु बदरीफलम् ।

कपित्थं सर्वदा पथ्यं **कदळी न कदाचन ॥ ( banana takes a lot of जाठर heat for digestion)**

**  
**

**चरकसूत्राणि ( सर्वर्त्र निर्धारणे षष्ठी )** --

  

क्षीरं जीवनीयानाम् । ( milk would help in keeping up the age and improve resistance - सुश्रुत recommends for every प्राणी )

मांसं बृंहणीयानाम् । ( meat would cause obesity )

क्षारः पुंस्त्वोपघातिनाम् । ( salt kills the sperm)

अमलकं वयःस्थापकानाम् । ( preventing early old age symptoms and maintaining youth)

कालभोजनम् आरोग्यकराणाम् । ( food at the same time regularly helps to be healthy )

वेगसन्धारणम् अनारोग्यकराणाम् । ( holding back वेगाः - such as toilets , sleep, hunger etc are often the cause of ill health )

  

So even if people are working in the fields with कौपीनम् ( G-string) during Sun it is good for health - but too much exposure is not . If they take good food nothing happens .

  

Today there are 30% of people who are suffering from health problems due to non-exposure to Sun ( Air Conditioning in office , house and vehicle ) .

  

युक्ताहारविहारस्य विधिवद्युक्तचेतसः ।

व्याधयो नोपसर्पन्ते पन्नगाशनमिवोरगाः ॥

  

Just to give my own experience - I stared at the Sun with naked eyes during the Sun eclipse some thirty years ago , in spite of the serious warnings .Nothing happened .

  

Even today I challenge that if cut with a rusted knife that does not cause Tetanus (धनुर्वातः) \|

  

But we are not supposed to encourage people to go against the standard and common principles of health andhygiene .

  

Feel free to raise any questions further .

  

Also विद्वान्सः may let me know whether I am too brief in my postings or any modification is needed .

  

We are spending a lot of time and it should be useful to scholars - no room for ego .

  

धन्यो’स्मि
