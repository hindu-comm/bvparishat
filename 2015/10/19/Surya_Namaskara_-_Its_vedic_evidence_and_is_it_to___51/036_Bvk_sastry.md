Namaste

  

1\.  Professor Koradas statement on proper understanding if source works in Sankrit ( Samkrutham) reading as below is a golden standard of tradition:

\<. Any sentence has to be understood in terms of पदवाक्यप्रमाणशास्त्रs ... Sometimes it means - अति सर्वत्र वर्जयेत् । Just look at these examples -->.

  

2. Coming to the point of understanding the true meaning of the words \< Surya-Namaskara, Baalaatapa> and practices associated with them as one can glean from the practices, there seems to be mix up of issues:

A ) the practice directives of Suryanamaskara comes from yoga - health care practices; who look at current western model of Sun as the Earths light source sending out a mixed range of heat and light rays , which also contain harming effort if unduly meddled with. The yoga purpose of ' Adityasya Namaskaaraan ..' Is not the same as Sun watching/ gazing/ tanning and the like! For that matter, even the electric incandescent or florescent light also has similar effects ( and practicing yogis say that this can happen even when watching the oil lamp or candle !).

  

B) surya namaskara as a mass promotion of yoga for masses to promote early morning rise and physical fitness exercise is not necessarily combined with the tighter and specific regulations under smriti for varna- ashrama religious practices and Ayurveda guidance for some health benefits.

In this context, one may look at the conceptuality of pancha- agni- tapas, where surya gazing is an integral part. This guidance will be called a total health hazard from any modern health care provider! So, should one draw a conclusion that ancients advocated hoga practices and tapas with built in health hazards - intentionally or ignorantly ?

  

Some thing to contemplate .
