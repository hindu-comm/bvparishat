Dear friends,  
  
When the Sun is overhead and the Sun;'s rays have the minimum distance ot travel through the atmospheric layer, the allowable time of exposure is about 10 to 15 minutes at a time. As in the morning hours the attenuation is higher a longer time of exposure is allowable but that does not mean that one can take the liberty to expose oneself in the Morning Sun for hours and come unscathed.   
  
Thus if we look at the discussions carefully, it has been resolved. Suryanamaskara can be done safely as it can be performed in a few minutes. Sio ais the vase of giving Arghya to the Sun  
  
  

As regards the scantily dressed farmers in Tamilnadu, exposing themselves to the morning Sun for hours, the intelligent people, such as the members of this esteemed group, can try to spread the awareness that it is not safe to expose oneself without a cloth-cover to the Sun's rays, even in the morning hourd for long time.  
  

Regards,
