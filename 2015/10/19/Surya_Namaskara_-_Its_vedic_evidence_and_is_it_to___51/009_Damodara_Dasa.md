One need / should not stand in sunlight --  
  
बालार्को प्रेतधूमश्च वृद्धा स्त्री पल्वलोदकम् ।  
रात्रौ दध्यन्नभुक्तिश्च आयुः क्षीणं दिने दिने ॥  
  
वृद्धार्को होमधूमश्च बाला स्त्री निर्मलोदकम् ।  
रात्रौ क्षीरान्नभुक्तिश्च आयुर्वृद्धिर्दिने दिने ॥  
मनुस्मृतिः , 4-69 --  
  
बालातपः प्रेतधूमो वर्ज्यं भिन्नं तथासनम् ।  
न छिन्द्यान्नखलोमानि दन्तैर्नोत्पाटयेन्नखान् ॥  
  
मनु , 4-37--  
  
नेक्षेतोद्यन्तमादित्यं नास्तंयन्तं कदाचन।  
नोपसृष्टं न वारिस्थं न मध्यं नभसो गतम् ॥  
  
उपसृष्टम् = eclipsed

This is exactly the reason I am asking this question. I found above  
quotes in Manu and other smrtis but has got doubt as many of the daily  
rituals as well as practices followed in ancient India, in my  
information, involved exposing to early morning sun - like the farmers  
have to work in the early morning sun, pratah snanam, agnihotra, etc.  
  
Surya namaskara is also a famous activity and thus I asked question  
based on it. The question arose because the famous activity of sun  
bath needs to be thoght over if balarka is to be avoided. Then this  
means that sun bath is to be taken after 2.5 hours of sun-rise which  
seems quite strange. Although atapa-sevanam is mentioned at some  
places in ayurveda but I did not find details of its procedure.  
  
So questions arose that if Manu smrti's (and some other smrtis also)  
statement of avoiding balarka is to be followed then is it that the  
traditional practices mentioned are not the original one? The farmers  
cannot avoid balarka - imagine a farmer starting to farm after 3 hours  
of sunrise and then work for 4 hours in heavy sunlight. It will be too  
tiring for him.  
  
Thankyou,
