 Traditions vary considerably. Arghya to Surya should be given outside the house facing east during sunrise and facing west during sunset.
Obviously sun in the early morning is in the easterly direction and not any where else so facing the sun mean east or easterly direction. One can give arghya inside the house if its snowing or raining outside.
