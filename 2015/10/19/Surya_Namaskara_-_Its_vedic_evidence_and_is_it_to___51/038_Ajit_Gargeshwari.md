Dear Damadar Dasa ji,  
  

Do you expect scholars to keep posting for ever? A few posts will normally cover the points raised. Some members tend to digress from the topic. This makes the thread too long making it inconvenient if a member wishes to catch up with discussions. One will then need additional posts to make summaries of what has been discussed to put the thread back in order. Look at any scholarly list a topic is closed within a day or two unless one is having a debate on a controversial topic. I hope you see my point  

Make a new topic if you feel a there is a need for supplementary topic that needs a discussion. All members can do that
