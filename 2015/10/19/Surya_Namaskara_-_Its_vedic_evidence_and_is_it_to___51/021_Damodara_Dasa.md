\>\> Asआतप means heat it is clear that by using the word वालातप Manu is referring to morning Sun-bath  
  

Does this mean that the age old practice of farmers' working in fields  
in early morning (till about 2 hours after sunrise), surya-namaskara,  
etc. wrong according to Manu Smrti and modern science? If there is  
danger of cancer then why do we not find great number of cases in  
farmers, who for time immemorial, are working in fields in early  
morning sun? Also Surya namaskara has very good health benefits  
recorded if done exposed to sun. Also the same manu smrti recommends  
sandhya vandanam and arghya exposing oneself to early morning  
sun.These need to be discussed.  
  
Thankyou,  
Damodara Das
