Dear friends,

Shri Damodara Dasaji had written as follows:

**Quote**

Reframing my question:  
Manu Smrti states to avoid bAlArka. But in tradition we find in all  
varnas that people do expose themselves to early morning sun - in  
offering arghya, snanam, working in fields, Surya namaskara, etc. Thus  
what about the above injunction of Manu Smrti (and similar injunctions  
in other smrtis).

**Unquote**

In 4.37 of Manu-Smriti our great ancestor Manu specifically advised us not to look directly at the Sun, but in 4.69 the exact word he used is वालातप. Asआतप means it is clear that by using the word वालातप Manu is referring to morning Sun-bath, which people like to do in cold morning as the warming oneself up in the Sun in a cold morning is very comfortable and enjoyable and people tend to continue that for pretty long time. We should be proud to know that what our great ancestor Manu wrote several thousand years ago, can only be explained with the help of modern science.

In the morning the low frequency (hence low-energy) infra-raed rays or heat rays of the Sun are attenuated to a great extent and that is why we feel the need to stay for more time in the Sun for warming ourselves up. However, in the morning, the high frequency (high energy) UV rays are attenuated to a much lesser extent than the heat rays. That is why a long exposure to morning Sun means more exposure to the UV-rays and which in turn means more harm to our body, particularly to the skin, which can even lead to skin cancer. Hope this amswers the query of Shri Damodara Dasaji.

Regards,

Sunil KB
