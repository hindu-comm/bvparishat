Hare Krishna.  

  
\>\> As regards the scantily dressed farmers in Tamilnadu, exposing themselves to the morning Sun for hours, the intelligent people, such as the members of this esteemed group, can try to spread the awareness that it is not safe to expose oneself without a cloth-cover to the Sun's rays, even in the morning hourd for long time.  
  

I understand this is the logic based on acceptance that long hours  
exposure to sun leads to preblems. But this practice (of farming  
wearing no upper garment) is widespread for centuries all over India  
(not just tamilnadu) and we do not see great number of cancer cases  
(compared to brahmanas who largely stay inside house). The age long  
data do not reflect our assumption. Of course farmers already know  
that exposure to hot sun (after about 11:00am) is harmful and they do  
avod it. But not so for early morning sun till about 10:00am. As this  
has been a long practice without evidence of any adverse effect, it  
cannot be just concluded that this practice is wrong and thus try to  
enlighten the so called "under the darkness" farmers to not doing so.  
Even if we try, it is impossible for them to do so as one needs at  
least about 6 hours of field work in any farm and the only alternative  
is (if not exposing to early morning sun) to expose to afternoon sun  
which is even more dangerous. Nor do we have profound evidential  
grounds on which we can come to conclusion that early morning sun  
exposure to farmers is detrimental.  
  
Thankyou,
