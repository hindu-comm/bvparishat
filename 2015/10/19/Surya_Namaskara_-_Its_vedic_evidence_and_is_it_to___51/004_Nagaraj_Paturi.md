It is the Aruna Prashna of Taittiriya Aranyaka of Yajurveda which is called Suryanamaskara Mantra.



The body postures and movements performed with the chanting of these mantras are believed to have long tradition.



In fact, certain powder-drawings (muggu/kolam/rangoli), which again are believed to have been handed down to us from the past are used during the Aruna prashnam supported Suryanamaskarams.



There is a Surya special issue of Kalyan magazine which has some good articles on the Vedic connection of Surya Namaskarams.
