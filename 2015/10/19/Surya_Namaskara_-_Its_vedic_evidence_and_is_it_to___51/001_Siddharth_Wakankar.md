Hare Krishna,

  

In our childhood,we were required to practise 12 Sooryanamaskaaras every day after our bath. It was,of course,indoors,facing the rising Sun.Some may prefer another round of 12 Sooryanamaskaaras in the evening also,facing the setting Sun.

  

Exposing our bodies to the Sun was of much importance,thinking that we are getting His Grace by prostrating before Him in Person.

  

H.H. Balasaheb Pant Pratinidhi,the Maharaja of the Aundh State,near Satara in Maharashtra,is given the credit of popularising the Sooryanamaskaara by actually practising it and writing a book on it. His book might have been reprinted now.

  

Moreover,there might be many more books,[esp.in](http://esp.in) Marathi,on the Sooryanamaskaaras.
