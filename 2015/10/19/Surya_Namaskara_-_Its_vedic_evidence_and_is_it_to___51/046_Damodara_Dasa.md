Hare Krishna.  
Respected vidvaj-janas,  
  
Thankyou very much for this very nice discussions. It is very helpful  
to understand these points. Specifically to Dr.Subrahmanyam Koradaji  
for his logic based rules for understanding of the statments of  
Smrtis, Dr.Rani Sadasivamurthy for quotes from ayurveda and vedic  
texts, and Sunil Bhattacaryaji for nice discussion based on modern  
science and sastras. Dr.Subrahmanyam Koradaji, your posts are exactly  
to point neither more nor less - mItAksarA, thus very nice to read  
them.  
  
I apologize to the vidvaj-janas and group if I am demanding too much a  
discussion on this topic. I request them to feel free to close this  
discussion.  
  
Respected Ajit Gargeshwariji, I understand your point and apologize  
for any mistake. If you want I can make a summary of this discussion  
and post in this thread or may be start a new thread unless the  
scholars want this discussion to close (for which I am ready). It may  
also be done that few of the scholars can personally be linked with me  
in this discussion and the whole bvp group is not involved and many  
may not be interested in this discussion.  
  
Thankyou,  
Damodara Das
