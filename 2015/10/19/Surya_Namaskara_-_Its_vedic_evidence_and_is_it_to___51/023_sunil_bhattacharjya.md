Shri Damodara Dasaji,  
  

One thing I forgot to mention and that is the fact that the clothings do give protection and the exposed parts of the body are only susceptible to the Sun's rays. Also please do not forget that the farmers do wear clothes and also the fact that the Asian Conical hats, including the Jaapiin Assam are used by the farmers in South-Asia and South-East Asia.  
  

As regards Surya-namaskara, you will agree with me that it would not take more than 10 to 15 minutes, the safe limit for exposure to the Sun.  
  

Do you want to say that Manu was wrong and the modern science also is wrong and that 3 to 4 hours of exposure of human skin to the Sun would not have any ill-effect ? If you say so, then let us agree to disagree.  

  
Thanks,  

Sunil KB".
