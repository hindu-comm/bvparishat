Namaste,  
  

I have read long ago that according to some interpreters of the Vastu Shastra it is beneficial to have a water tank on the east side of a east-facing house, for the primary reason that the reflections of the sunshine from the water in the tank to the front of the house is good for the persons getting exposed to that. I can guess that water absorbs the UV-radiation and the reflected light could be more beneficial than the direct sunlight.  
  
This point may not exactly fit in the present discussions. However if it is okay to have this point for discussions, I shall be happy if any learned member would like to throw more light on this.   
  

Regards,  

Sunil KB
