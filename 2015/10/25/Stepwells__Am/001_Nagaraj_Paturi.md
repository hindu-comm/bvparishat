There is at least one PhD work done by an Indian scholar on stepwells that I know.

  

One Dr Shekhar Chatterjee [](https://plus.google.com/u/0/114911682592051986471?prsrc=4)submitted a PhD thesis under the title of "ARTS, MYTHS and AESTHETIC VISUAL ETHNICITY OF QUEEN'S STEPWELL OF PATAN: A COMPREHENSIVE CULTURAL STUDY".
(Gujarat)

  

I came to know about this when he consulted me about Sthaapatya literature on "the project planning, selection of site, budgeting, team formation, basically how did the experts use to plan from scrapeto final level of perfection? the philosophical aspect behind them purely for the *Purushartha*purpose but in action how did they formulate step by step planning to implement the Indian way of Design."

  

There could be more.
