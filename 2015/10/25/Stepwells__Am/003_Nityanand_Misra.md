And it is ironical that the American woman would be charged a higher entry fees at ASI protected monuments in the country than Indian citizens! If her estimate of 1,000 stepwells is true, many must be in the same state as the Derelict Baoli in Fatehpur (photo 16 in the slideshow). As the common people of the country are not bothered about this heritage, it is up to the tourism departments in state governments to step forward and support such an effort.

  

I visited the two deep stepwells in Uparkot (Adi-Kadi Vav and Navghan Kuwo) in Junagadh many times in 1990s. One of the stepwells is around 1000 years old. Both the wells were then in a bad shape: scary and dangerous with no protective railing around the water. These stepwells historically had no ornate carvings, so people etched many of their own with the common motif being hearts with two names. I first visited the Adalaj Ni Vav near Ahmedabad in 1995, and remember noticing the Sanskrit inscription at its entrance. While it used to attract a lot more visitors than Uperkot, it was still in a state of neglect when I last visited it in 2004. I visited the magnificent Rani Ki Vav in Patan in 2008 (before it was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site: <http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/922/>). The compound was well-maintained by the ASI. There was a plaque, but no books or informational material. I do not know how things have changed since the World Heritage Site tag: I hope they have changed for the better. Some states have done a better job of preserving and marketing heritage sites than others. Rajasthan is an example where trusts established by former Maharajas have maintained palaces and museums really well.
