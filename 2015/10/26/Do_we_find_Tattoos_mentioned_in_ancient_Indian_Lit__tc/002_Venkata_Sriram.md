Dear Dipak Ji,  
  
The dEha is the abode of the dEvatAs. In tantra shAstra, it is mentioned that every part of the limb / body is presided by yOgini gaNa. And tattooing involves the torture of the skin / body part. This incurs the yOgini shApa that presides over that aspect of the limb.  
  
This is not a good practice and shri.bhAskararaya makhin also prohibits tapta-mudras etc.  
  
And certainly, going by the present times, for the fear of blood contact to the same needle, the tattooing should not be encouraged.  
  
regs,  
sriram
