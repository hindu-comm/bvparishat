Hare Krishna,  
  
Dear Vidvaj-janas,  
Tattooing is a very famous art today. I also remember some of my elder  
member in village having tattoes (of gods or om) on their arms. But I  
am curious if this art of tattooing mentioned in our scriptures. By  
tattooing I mean impressing a permanent inked image on the skin.  
Painting body may not be called tattooing.  
  
Thankyou,  
Damodara Das
