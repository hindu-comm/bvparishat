Hare Krishna.  

  
\>\> Is this a temporary sort of tattooing by the Vaishnavas, which you are referring to and the tattoo may not be permanent? I have seen some marking some parts of the body with bhashma and the others doing that with chandana paste.and that is done everyday.  
  

No no. Tapta-mudrana is a permanent mark of sankha, cakra, etc. on the  
body but ink mark is not involved - i.e. skin doesn't become black or  
blue colored but remains original skin colored.
