Thank you Subrahmanian ji.

This book is very helpful. Especially the description of the experience of saguna and nirguna.

It is a very honest and truthful description.

Kindly keep on sharing such valuable, original and experiential works.

This is the second book i read after Swami Muktananda's " Chitshaktivilas", which has such a clear description of kundalini and experience of supreme.

  

With love,
