Dear Scholars:

Recently in another thread Prof. Aklujkar made some important and valuable observations to ponder about. I like to share my reactions to his thoughts particularly on historicity, which somehow I found to be nuanced.

  

1. Ancient Indians do not seem have shunned something because of a thing’s known or probable foreign origin (recall: Yavana-jātaka or -siddhānta, praising Mlecchas for their skill in making yantras, pronouncements like ā no bhadrāḥ kratavo yantu viśvataḥ).

  

The trouble I face constantly is with definitions: The above statement is true, but the opposite also can be found in many texts and also to have beenpracticed religiously.For example Manusmrti does not consider people living south of Vindhyas to be fit for dhaarmic interaction. There are several such injunctions. Currently this may have no validity, but I see here a problem with the definition of what was 'ancient India' and what was 'foreign', in mapping the Dharmic tradition. Textual 'dharma' and practical dharma differ quite widely, but strong desire to have textual sanction exists.  
  
2. ....Smṛtis change according to deśa and kāla. What is more important for smṛti acceptance is not the origin of a thing but what the learned and insightful, having no vested interest, the śiṣṭas, conclude about possible effects, relative to the time, region and measure and way of acceptance (in this case, consumption).

  

This statement is very logical provided "deśa, kāla andśiṣṭas" are left to be floating. Almost every characteristic Sanskrit word or phrase used in current dhaarmic parlance seems to have had variableshades of meaning over time. Smrtis change with "time". But the smrti-kaaras have tried to impose a sense ofhistoricityof ancientnesson the available texts: Thus. pointers of 'dharma' of that 'kala'composed very latelyare ascribed to ancient, Vedic-Rshis.Manu, Parashara, Narada, Vasistha, all have smritis assigned to them, so that people think that these were preached and composed by the most famous, most ancient Vedic Rshis. All lingering doubts in interpretations are supposed to be settled by reference tośiṣṭas. How to locate or identify them now? But in an earlier period the meaning of this word appears to have been etymological, to mean "those who are remaining". We read in Brahmanda Purana Ch 32.37 that those who remained at the end of the manvantara are the originalśiṣṭas.

This may be the reason for ascribing several texts (including some Jyotisha samhitas) to one among the Saptarshis and other Rshis of yore.

  

4. Attaching greater importance to (a) timeless or non-diachronic principles and (b) conclusions drawn by contemporary unselfish scholars is the strength of dharmic traditions. It is what allows them to see no conflict between science and religiosity and to change as objective knowledge changes (although they too are at present under pressure to become organized religions). If greater importance is attached to historicity, the Indian dharma traditions will suffer from the same logical and social weaknesses as the exclusivistic religions do (rigidity of dogma, naive insistence on only one name, one scripture etc.). History is important, but it should not be the sole or most dominant arbiter of how life is led.

  

Well said. Hinduism, unwritten is a religion of religions, (or a meta-religion) where there are multifarious religious groups and organizations each one constantly striving for equilibrium but always having some level of tension among themselves. The dhaarmic tradition has all these days modulated itself, without attaching importance to chronological historicity, but managing with the help of ***a-historical*** paradigms such as Kalpas, Manvantaras, avataaras,śiṣṭas etc. In all these ideas the sense of "ancientness" (sanaatana ?) is embedded like a dogma. If there is no apparent conflict between Hinduism and science, it is because of the Vedic religious perceptions (in some yet unknown historical time) were nearer to empirically observable Nature and the*śiṣṭas* of those days, internalized the equivalence of micro and macrocosm and passed the message to their progeny. History should not be the sole arbiter but knowing correct history, including chronology wherever possible, will in no way harm the dhaarmic way of life.

  

best regards
