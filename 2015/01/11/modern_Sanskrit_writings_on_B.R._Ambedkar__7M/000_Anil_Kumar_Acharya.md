Respected Scholars,  
Namaste.  
Could any one provide my any comprehensive list of modern Sanskrit  
writings on B.R.Ambedkar. I am aware of two kavyas, i.e. Bheemayanam  
and Ambedkardarshanam, but both are not in my possession, which I  
would like to buy. Could any one help me to get those or provide  
information of their availability.  
with regards
