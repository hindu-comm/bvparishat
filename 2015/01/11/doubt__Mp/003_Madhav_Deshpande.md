Thanks, Dipak, for bringing up aparāhṇa. "Afternoon" in American usage covers the time from noon till evening, and hence probably would include madhyāhna and aparāhṇa within it. "Good Day" has the sense of saying "Good Bye" to someone. The word "Good Night" has the same sense. These two expressions are used to conclude a conversation. On the other hand,
"Good morning", "Good afternoon" and "Good evening" have the sense of greeting or welcoming someone in the morning, afternoon or evening.
