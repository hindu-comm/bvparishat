Dear Madhav, by interpretation according to the etymological meaning madhyaahna should be the mid-point that means midday; midi or Mittag without extension after or before. Aparaahna should follow it immediately. Then 'afternoon' ''Nachmittag' 'après-midi'should be exact equivalents of aparaahna. There is unfortunately no English equivalent of puurvaahna. Forenoon 'Vormittag' 'matin' do not hold.  

The astrologers may coin terms according to convenience of dividing the day. I am not going into those and told of the etymological meaning. In Indian usage, however, noon 'dupahar' continues for sometime after 12 noon. In English, German or French they are more or less strict.
