In Sanskrit plays, we do not have expressions equivalent of good afternoon. We do not have such expressions in contemporary or older forms of Indian languages too.



The words for afternoon, evening etc. do not figure in Sanskrit greeting expressions.



सुप्रभातम् does figure as a greeting. It takes षष्ठी of मध्यमपुरुष as inतव सुप्रभातम् .



In general there are expressions such as अभिवादये ,स्वस्ति, आयुष्मान्भवetc.



In Bhasa'sप्रतिमानाटकम् ,



Bharata greets LakshmaNa as:



एवं गुरुरयम् । आर्य ! अभिवादये।



After knowing from Sumantra that he was his younger brother LakshmaNa responds as:



वत्स! स्वस्ति! आयुष्मान् भव!



If something similar to सुप्रभातम् is created, can that beतव शुभापराह्णम्?



Humbly,



Nagaraj
