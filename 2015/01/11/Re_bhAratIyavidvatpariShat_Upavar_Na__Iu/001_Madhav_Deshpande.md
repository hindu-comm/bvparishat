Dear Dr. Joshi,

  

  The term varṇakula as used by Patañjali in his Mahābhāṣya does not refer to "a set of allophones of "A"". If we use the modern term "phoneme" to refer to Sanskrit sounds, then a short अ and a long आ are different phonemes and not allophones. All 18 varieties of "a" differing in length and accent are separate phonemes. Probably the distinction of nasal/non-nasal vowels may be subsumed under the modern notion of allo-phones in some instances, but not in others. Thus, it is difficult to have a direct correlation of modern terminology with the ancient Sanskrit terminology. Some varṇas may be allophones, while other varṇas are distinct phonemes. This is because the definitions of the ancient term varṇa is not the same as that of the modern notion of phoneme or allophone. In ancient Śikṣā conception, varṇas become different from each other on the basis of svara, kāla, sthāna, prayatna and anupradāna. On the other hand, the distinction between a phoneme and an allophone is that an interchange of phonemes changes the identity of a word, while allophones do not do that. The allophones are sub-phonemic distinctions that may be due to gender, age, individual pitch variation, volume variation etc., but these distinctions do not alter the identity of a perceived word. They provide us further information about the speaker, but not a different lexical meaning.
Phonemes, on the other hand, alter the word. Unfortunately, in the English translations of Sanskrit grammatical and phonetic treatises, these nuances often get lost, because of the translator not being intimately familiar with the modern usage of these terms in their own disciplinary environment.
