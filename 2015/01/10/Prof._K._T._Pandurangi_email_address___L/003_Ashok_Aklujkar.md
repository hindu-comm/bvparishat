Dear Madhav,

  

It seems you did not get my email sent on 10 Jan. I am having problems with the “send”

command of my MAIL browser, especially after I installed the Yosemite operating system.

  

KTP can be reached through email[in...@dvaitavedanta.com]() or, possibly through\<[veer...@gmail.com]()Dr. Veeranarayana N.K. Pandurangi is KTP’

s nephew. When in Bangalore two years ago, I got the impression that KTP’ s residence is the same as

DVAITA VEDANTA STUDIES & RESEARCH FOUNDATION. No.11, Uttaradi Matha Compound, Uttaradi Matha Road, Basavanagudi, Bangalore-560 004. Telefax : 2662 7272 email : [in...@dvaitavedanta.com]() website : [www.dvaitavedanta.com](http://www.dvaitavedanta.com). He is the HON. DIRECTOR. His T [+91 80 2664 8215](tel:+91%2080%202664%208215).

  

On 27 November 2014, when I gave a lecture on A;soka’as date at Karnataka Skt U, Bangalore, KTP honoured me by being in the audience (in a wheelchair but quite alert at 96, I believe).
