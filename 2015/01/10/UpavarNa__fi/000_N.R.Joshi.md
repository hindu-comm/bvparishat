Thanks Dr. N.Paturi, Dr.S R. Murthy and other scholars who took time to explain what Prof Balgangadhara was saying about History and Itihaasa.



(1) Now I have couple of questions about Sanskrit words and writing. In couple of postings on BVP I noticed the word VarNa is also written as VarNNa and KarNa is written as KarNNA. Was this error or are there different spellings of the same words.



(2) Second question--What is meant by UpavarNa? Apte dict offers meaning as minute description. Is there other meaning to the word?



(3) Can the word Phonology be understood as VarNaantara? Thanks. N.R.Joshi
