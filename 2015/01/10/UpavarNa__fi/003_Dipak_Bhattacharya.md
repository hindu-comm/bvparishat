Dear Dr. Joshi,  

The doubling of spar;sas and anta.hsthas is very frequent in MSS. One can note this in pronunciation too  

Paa.nini (8.4.46) allows this for all consonants except -h- after vowel +r but the MSS do not show the doubling of sibilants. The doubling, as the evidence suggests, follows actual pronunciation that has been approved by Paa.nini.  

Best
