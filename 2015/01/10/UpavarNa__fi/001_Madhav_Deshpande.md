Dear Dr. Joshi,

  

  The doubling in words like varṇṇa, karṇṇa is not truly lexical, but can happen due to rules of optional consonantal doubling. Such phenomena are often seen in Sanskrit manuscripts. As for "phonology" being understood as Varṇāntara, that is not how the word "phonology" is understood in that discipline. While "phonetics" refers to the study of sounds, especially their production and perception, "phonology" is understood as the study of the behaviour and relationships of sounds to each other. As an example, the description of the production of sounds in the Śikṣās and Prātiśākhyas would come under "phonetics", while the rules of Sandhi would come under "phonology". Hope this explains the modern usage of these words in these fields. Best,

  

Madhav Deshpande
