After some internet research, now I realize that the word 'upavarN' (found in the title of the present thread )is used in languages like Marathi and Gujarati as a technical term of modern linguistics , as the equivalent in those languages for the English term of modern linguistics 'allophone'.



Dr. N R Joshi used another word varNaantara in the thread initiating post.



The problem with these two words upavarN and varNaantaris that they are found in the sense of sub-caste and across the caste respectively outside the discipline of linguistics.



I guess that if the word varNaantar is used in modern north Indian languages in the context of modern linguistics, it must have been being used in the context of phonemics (of which the concept of allophone is a part ) only, because one of thecriteria on the basis of whicha phone is identified as a phoneme is its distinct status vis-à-vis other phones. (varNaantar in this context may mean 'a different varNa )



But any further progress in the understanding of Dr. Joshi's question is possible only if he shares the context where he found the two terms.
