Dear BVP colleagues,

  

  Someone recently sent me a title-page from an old booklet that says that it can be ordered from Pandit Gursahay who is "shahajahanpur pathshala chugisanskrit ke adhyapak". What could this term Chugi Sanskrit refer to? I have attached that title-page. Any suggestions would be welcome.
