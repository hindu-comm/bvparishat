Dear Sir,

It seems to me that in the page you attached a comma and an anuswar are missing. That is the problem which is causing confusion. The book was published much earlier when the use of comma was not frequent. Actually, the reading should be 'shahajahanpur pathshala, chungi, sanskrit ke adhyapak'. In Shahjahanpur, there is a Sanskrit pathshala nearby Chungi. Chungi is a Hindi word which means a kind of road tax. Therefore, the place where people pay road tax is also called Chungi. The person who published the book would have been a Sanskrit teacher in the Sanskrit college, situated near Chungi, Shahjahanpur.

With regards.
