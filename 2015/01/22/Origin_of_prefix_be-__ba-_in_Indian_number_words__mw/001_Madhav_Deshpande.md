As far as I can tell, the element "b" in words like "battīsa" and "bahattar" is simply the Prakritization of Sanskrit "dva" in the words dvātriṃśat etc. The change of dv \> v \> b is seen in numerous words, and also just the change of v \> b in words like bīs from viṃśati is pretty common. Dvāviṃśati becomes bāvīs in Marathi, and bāīs in Hindi, showing different phases of Prakritization.
