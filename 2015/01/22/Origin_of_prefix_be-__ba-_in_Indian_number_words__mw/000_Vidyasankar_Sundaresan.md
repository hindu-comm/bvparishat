I recently learned that the word battIsa rAga is used for the number thirty-two in the old Kannada vacana-s of basavaNNa (12th c), which has started off a line of enquiry for which I see no easy answers out there. I can understand the term bAhattara meLa in 17th c Tanjavur as deriving from Marathi, but I didn't know that there was a much earlier presence of the word battIs in the Karnataka region.  
  
So, is there an indigenous Indian etymology for words like bA-Is, ba-ttIs, be-yAlIs etc, which are used in Hindi and other Indian languages today? I am curious whether there are precedents in one of the varieties of Prakrit for prefixing a **ba-** sound. I don't think a Middle Eastern linguistic origin for this practice can be justified. Meanwhile, Gujarati does have the word **be** for two, while the words for all other numbers between one and ten have a clear relationship to Sanskrit.  
  
Best regards,
