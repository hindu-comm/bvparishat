Please consider the possibility of the sound 'Be/Bhe' indicating 2 being original to ancient Sanskrit. Bhe-ruNDa is a special bird supposedly with two heads. I remember MBh has a reference to this. I have wondered whether the nitya-dvivacana word 'ubhau' may be related to 'bhe'. Perhaps the root 'bhid - to break' gives rise to the concept of numeral 2 acquiring the notation 'bhe' . English seems to retain this link in words such as 'bi-directional, bi-valent, bi-polar...'. ...Excuse me if linguistically my speculation is not acceptable!
