The rule the Prākṛtaprakāśaḥ (PP, dated 3rd century BCE)which explains this is उपरि लोपः कगडतदपषसाम् (प्रा॰प्र॰ ३-१).

  

“\[There is\] elision (लोपः) of consonants क् ग् ड् त् द् प् ष् स् (कगडतदपषसाम्) \[when they are\] at the beginning of conjunct (उपरि).”  

This leads to dvā- becoming bā-

द्वा -> उपरि लोपः कगडतदपषसाम् (प्रा॰प्र॰ ३-१) -> वा -> वबयोरभेदः -> बा

Usually consonant elision in a conjunct in Prakrit is followed by duplication of the ‘other’ (remaining) consonant by the rule शेषदेशयोर्द्वित्वमनादौ (प्रा॰प्र॰ ३-५०). But that is not applicable in this case due to the condition of अनादौ – the duplication happens only if the consonant is not at the beginning \[of the word\].Bhāmaha in the Manoramā commentary on PP gives the examples of **khaliaṃ** (Skt: skhalitam) **khambo** (Skt: stambhaḥ) **thavao** (Skt: stabakaḥ) where there is no duplication as the conjunct is at the beginning.

Some authors show the route dva -> vva -> va -> ba but that derivation is incorrect as per Prākṛtaprakāśaḥ, since PP 3-50 does not apply in this case.
