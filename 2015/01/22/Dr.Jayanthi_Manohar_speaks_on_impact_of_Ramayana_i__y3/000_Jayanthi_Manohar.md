The World Ramayana Conference from 23rd to 25th January 2015 at National College Grounds, Bangalore.  
Impact of Ramayana in South East Asian Countries  
Audio visual lecture by Dr. Jayanthi Manohar on 25th January at 3 P.M.  
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
  
This Audio-visual Presentation gives a glimpse of the glorious past of Indian culture in South East Asian Countries. A journey of Indian culture to different parts of the globe far and wide may be traced through the impact of Ramayana seen in the Art, Architecture, Music, Dance and literature. Ramayana is rewritten in many of these countries along with the adaptation of local culture.  
  
You may also watch my depiction of position of women through ages and the ways and means adopted by law makers in ancient India for their protection.  
  
In Shankara T.V. at 3 P.M. on every Thursday.
