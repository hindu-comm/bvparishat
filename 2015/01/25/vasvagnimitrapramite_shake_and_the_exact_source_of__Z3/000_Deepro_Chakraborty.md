Dear Members,

There is a colophonic reference to the date of a manuscript as "वस्वग्निमित्रप्रमिते शके...". Vasu is definitely 8. Should I consider agni as 3 (ahavaniya, garhapatya and dakshina)? Does Mitra refer to the Adityas who are 12 in number? Then this date must be 1238 Saka. I am quite doubtful if the manuscript is that old. I just want to clarify if I am right.

  

It is a Vishnusahasranama stotra manuscript written in Bengali characters.

  

One more question: Does this Vishnusahasranama belong to the Anusasanaparvan or the Santiparvan? The colophon says "इति श्रीमहाभारते शतसाहस्र्यसंहितायां वैयासिक्यां शान्तिपर्वणि दानधर्म्मे उत्तमानुशासने श्रीविष्णोर्नामसहस्रं संपूर्ण्णं॥" But in the Adyar edition it is clearly mentioned to be taken from the Anusasana parvan. Is the difference caused due to different recensions of the Mahabharata?

  

Regards,

Deepro.
