Dear Members,

  

This talk was given as a part of the **SandHI Workshop on Mathematics & Astronomy in Ancient India** held on 31st October 2014  

at IIT Kanpur

My talk was titled

  

[Observation, Astronomy, music, and Mathematics in Ancient India Prof. R. N. Iyengar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-7YmLEZtVQ)  

  

  

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-7YmLEZtVQ>  

  

The work is based entirely on Sanskrit texts. The audio recording is not very clear, still this may be of interest to some members here.

  

Regards

  

RN Iyengar
