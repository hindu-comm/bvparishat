Dear Sir/Madam,  
  

Manipal University (MU) and Chinmaya International Foundation (CIF) in Kerala had jointly organized a two-week international summer school this year for the university students and scholars on **The Living Philosophies and Cultures of India**, which had participants from different countries as well.

  

As the Summer School was well received and appreciated by the participants and the resource persons, we are organising the Summer School **The Word and The World â€“ A Philosophical Inquiry ** from July 13-25, 2015 yet again in the coming academic year. [Prof Shrinivasa Varakhedi](http://www.ksu.ac.in/en/administration/vice-chancellor/), (Vice Chancellor) - Karnataka Sanskrit University and [Prof Ashok Aklujkar](http://www.asia.ubc.ca/people1/ashok-aklujkar/), University of British Columbia, Canada will lead the School as Course Directors and many eminent scholars will be delivering lectures and conduct intensive discussions on different aspects of Indian philosophies.

  

Please let us know if you think this could be of interest to your friends and colleagues and also share this with your international office. However, more than individual participation of students, we expect a group of students participating in it led by international offices of institutes/universities.

Please feel free to contact us for any information.

  

Thanks and regards,
