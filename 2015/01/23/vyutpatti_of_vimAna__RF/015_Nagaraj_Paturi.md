All the etymologies provided so far are highly apt and useful. This is how etymologies of words are studied. No furtherjustifications are required for this usual and legitimateacademic activity.



1\. Prof. Rani's वेगेन अम्बरगमने वे: - पक्षिण: (वि: - पक्षी इत्यर्थे विद्यमानत्वात्) मानम् इव मानम् यस्य स: विमान: इति कथ्यते।

explains most features of विमान:

2. Prof. Korada's

1.विशिष्टं मानयन्ति अनेन - मान पूजायाम् (चुरादि) - ' पुंसि संज्ञायां घः प्रायेण '(पा सू 3-3-18) .

2\. विशेषेण मान्ति अस्मिन् इति वा - मा माने (अदादि) - ’ करणाधिकरणयोश्च ’ (पा 3-3-117) ल्युट् ।

3\. विगतं मानम् उपमा अस्य वा । मनु अवबोधने (तनादि) , घञ् 3-3-18 , मानम् ।



are all useful too.



2 is similar to Monier Williams.



1 is particularly useful because apart from the meanings of 1. air-vehicle 2. Palanquin , it is useful for understanding vimaana of the South Indian temples too.



3 is now clarified by Prof. Korada as निरुपमानम् .



Which of these is 'the correct' etymology? There need necessarily be such a single correct etymology. A single word might have more than one 'correct' etymologies.What appears to be the same word sometimes could be different words with the same sound (homophonous ). Those different lexical items might have different etymologies. Or sometimes different lexical items too might have the same etymology.



For example, air-vehicle विमानः might have Prof. Rani's etymology and temple architectural विमानः might have 1 of Prof. Korada as its etymology.



Or, though the air-vehicle विमानः palanquin विमानः and temple architectural विमानःare all different words, they might have the same 1 of Prof. Korada astheiretymology.



Just like Prof. Rani's etymology, 2 of Prof. Korada also applies only to air- vehicle meaning. In an extended 'traverse' meaning 2 of Prof. Korada applies to all vehicles. But only when combined with 1of Prof. Korada , it is saved from ativyaaptidosha and then applies to air-vehicle, palanquin and horse (ref. Apte). But Prof. Rani's etymology, 2 of Prof. Koradaare not useful for temple architectural vimaana. It is 1 of Prof. Korada which is useful there.
