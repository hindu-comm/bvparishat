Monier Williams gives :



विमा vi-√3. mā, P. A. –māti, -mimīte, to measure, meet out, pass over, traverse, RV.; Br.; Kauś.; to enumerate , Bh.P. ; to ordain , fix, set right, arrange, make ready, prepare, RV.

3. Vi-māna mf(ī)n (for I see p.951, col.3; for 2 under *vi-√man* ) measuring out, traversing , RV. ; AV.; M.Bh.; m .n. a car or chariot of the gods, any mythical self-moving aerial car,………



Thus, it appears that his 'measure out' and 'traverse' are etymological meanings only .
