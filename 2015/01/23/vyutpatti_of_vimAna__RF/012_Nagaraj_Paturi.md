Just now one justification for



विगतं मानम् उपमा अस्य वा । मनु अवबोधने (तनादि) , घञ् 3-3-18 , मानम् ।  

struck me.



विगतं मानम् with the meaning of मनु अवबोधने (तनादि) is without अवबोधन which is 'mad' 'crazy' . There are poetic expressions for objects moving in the sky such as clouds in the forms such as 'moving likemad'.



But a विमानम् is depicted everywhere as the one moving under control only.
