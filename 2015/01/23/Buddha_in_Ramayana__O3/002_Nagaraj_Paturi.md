Thank you Prof. Dipak Bhattacharya, for this pointer.



This verse is being used for dating the authorship of Ramayana later to Buddhism. But this identification of the verse asinterpolation counters all such approaches.



Some people tried to remove the meaning of Buddha as a specific personality and interpret the words buddhah and tathaagatah in a different meaning than referring to a personality.



e.g. In Desiraju Hanumantha Rao and KMK Murthy uploaded version at

<http://www.valmikiramayan.net/ayodhya/sarga109/ayodhya_109_frame.htm>



it is interpreted as follows:

yathaa hi choraH sa tathaa hi buddha \|  
stathaagataM naastikamatra vidhhi \|  
tasmaaddhi yaH shaN^kyatamaH prajaanaam \|  
na naasti kenaabhimukho budhaH syaat 2-109-34

34\. yathaahi tathaa hi= It is an exact state of the case; saH= that; buddhaH= a mere intellection; choraH= (is deserves to be punished) as a thief; viddhi= and know; naastikam= an atheist; atra= here; tathaagatam= to be on par with a mere intellectual; tasaat= therefore; yaH= he who; shaN^kya tamaH= is the most suspectable; prajaanaam= (should be punished in the interest of) the people; na syaat= In no case; buddhaH= should a wise man; abhimukhaH= consort; naastikaa= with an atheist.

"It is an exact state of the case that a mere \*intellection deserves to be punished as it were a thief and know an atheist to be on par with a mere intellectual. Therefore he is the most suspectable and should be punished in the interest of the poeple. In no case should a wise man consort with an atheist."

\* It is the word that is responding to the chanllenge, which we call intellection. Truth/God is very subtle. A mind that is caught in the net of words/arguments cannot understand truth/God.
