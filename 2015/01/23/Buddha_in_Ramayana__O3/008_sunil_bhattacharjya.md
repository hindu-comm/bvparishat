Namaste,  
  

Let us agree to disagree. I am sure those who have read the materials of the last four lectures of Dr. Sukhtankar on the Mahabharata, which he delivered at the Asiatic Society, Bombay, would know the reason. The Asiatic society had published these materials and made a very succinct comment stating that Dr. Sukhtankar reversed his editorial policy, for which he stood all his life. Out of the scheduled four lectures, Dr. Sukhtankar could deliver only three lectures on three days and it is very sad that on the fourth day (i.e., on the last day) he passed way before he could deliver his last lecture. I was fortunate to read those lecture materials along with the editorial comments and that was some forty years ago.  
  

Regards,
