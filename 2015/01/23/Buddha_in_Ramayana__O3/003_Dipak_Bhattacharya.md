You are welcome!  

I must find out where Dr. R.C.Hazra, the most well-knoiwn authority on the history of the Puraa.nas said this. Perhaps it is the the first volume of the Studies in the Upapuraa.nas. I remember the revered Hazra, who never said anything that he was not definite about. I miss my teacher often.
