Dear friends,  
  

Kindly permit me to address the very first question posed by Shri Ramchander Deekonda. Lord Ram lived long before Lord Buddha, Valmiki mentions the four-tusked elephants in Lanka and that type of elephant disappeared from the Earth, about eight to nine thousand years ago.
Therefore any mention of Buddha would obviously not refer to Lord Buddha,  
  

I am attaching a page with that particular verse (**Ramayana :
2,109,34**) from D.P. Sharma's translation, which appears to make sense.  
  

Regards,
