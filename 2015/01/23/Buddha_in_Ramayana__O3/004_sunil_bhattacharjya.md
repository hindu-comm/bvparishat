Dear friends,  
  
Quite sometime ago I happened to read the ***Kapila-Asuri Samvada***, the most ancient version of the Sankhya in the Southern-recension of the Mahabharata, and that does mention **Buddha**, who is none other than the Sankhya-jnani, the ultimate goal of the seeker on the Sankhya-path.  
  

Lord Buddha learnt Sankhya by his guru Allada (Allara) Kalama. Lord Buddha was not satisfied with the multiplicity of the souls and he contested that the multiplicity cannot be the final step in the search. On further meditation he realized the truth of the Universal unity and then he became Buddha.  
  

Thus it is beyond doubt that the word "Buddha" is more an Epithet or Designation, known from the Mahabharata times five thousand years ago, if not earlier.  
  
Regards,
