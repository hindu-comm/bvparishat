=====Mod Note===========  
  

  

Lord Ram lived long before Lord Buddha, Valmiki mentions the four-tusked elephants in Lanka and that type of elephant disappeared from the Earth, about eight to nine thousand years ago.  
  

Whats the basis of this absurd chronology and four-tusked tusk elephants, I think Suniji, needs to post main stream research here. Wild speculations are best left out  
  

Request to Suniliji not post non mainstream speculations
