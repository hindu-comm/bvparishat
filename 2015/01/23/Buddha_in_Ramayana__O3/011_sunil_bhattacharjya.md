Dear Ajitji,  
  

The four lecture-details of Dr. V.S.Sukhtankar were published later on by Motilal Banarsidass in a book form under the name "The Meaning of Mahabharata" and manycould have read the same. I happened to read that long ago and it is not possible to supply the book. Had it been available to me in pdf, I would have sent that without delay.  
  

Secondly I would like to draw your attention to the fact the Mahabharata in the final form has been said to have 100,000 verses. To my knowledge nobody has found any version of Mahabaharata with more than 100,000 verses. that shows that there were very good chances of dropping off verses in some verses but there is very little chance of interpolation. Had there been interpolation the total number of verses should have exceeded 100,000. If you are aware of any version of Mahabharata with more than 100,000 verses, you may kindly let us  
know.  
  

Dr. Pradip Bhattacharya from Kolkata had recently made the following announcement in the "mahabharata_study" yahoogroup, and I congratulate Dr. Pradip Bhattacharya for his laudable effort.

I have just sent to Writers Workshop my complete English translation, sloka by sloka, in free verse and prose (there are prose passages too in the original) of the Mokshadharma Parva. It runs to nearly 1,81,000 words, 928 pages of A-4 size in single space. Let's see when it comes out. This conflates the Gita Press, Bhandarkar and Haridas Siddhantavagish editions (the last has many passages not found anywhere else). The Gita Press includes much from the Southern Recension. So this will be most complete translation so far--much more than K.M.Ganguli or M.N.Dutt's.
