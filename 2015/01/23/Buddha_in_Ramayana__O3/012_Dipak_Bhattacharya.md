One will find an account of the history of the stage by stage growth of the Mahābhārata on pp.323 - 327 of the 1926 - 27 edition of the Mrs. Ketkar's English translation of the first volume of Winernitz's (1907) *Geschichte der indischen Literatur*. It speaks of internal evidence for pre-Śatasāhasrī-Saṃhitā versions in 8800 and 24000 verses.
