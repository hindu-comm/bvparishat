Namaste,  
  
It is true that the Mahabharata had the three stages of composition / compilation and the Mahabharata itself was the first to divulge that. In the beginning the sage Vedavyasa composed the Jaya-Samhita, which had 8,800 verses. This was expanded by Vedavyasa himself to the Bharata-Samhita, which had 24,000 verses. It was this Bharata-Samhita, which Vaishampayana nrarrated to Janmejaya at the Sarpayajna, on the express directive of Vedavyasa himself. Vedavyasa was present during that narration. There were questions cropping up during that narration and additional materials got added at that time and that is the genesis of the Mahabharata of 100,000 verses. Thus Vedavyasa was thoroughly involved in the production of the version of the Mahabharata with 100,000 verses and the Adi parva attributes the 100,000 verses to Vedavyasa only.  
  

As regards Prof. M. Winternitz, the writer of*"Geschichte der indischen Literatur"* ("A history of Indian Literature" *-* in English)I have no doubt that he was a great scholar, yet we all know now, that the scenario on the India's antiquity has changed considerably, since the days of Prof. Winternitz, who worked for some years as an assistant of Prof. Max Muller, the architect of the Aryan invasion theory (AIT).
Prof. Winternitz was obviously influenced by the AIT, like his contemporaries were in those days, and he obviously subscribed to the view that the Mahabharata period was around 6th century BCE, in keeping with the AIT time-line. We now know that the AIT view was wrong, thanks to the archeological findings on the lost river Sarasvati as well as the astronomical studies, which support the Pauranic Chronology, according to which the Mahabharata period was in the 32nd century BCE. Had Prof. Winternitz been alive today it is possible that he might have changed some of his views, after seeing these fresh evidences.
