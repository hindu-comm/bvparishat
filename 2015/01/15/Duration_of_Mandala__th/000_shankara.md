Pranams to all,

  

I have heard that one mandala equals forty one days (as in the case of devotees of Ayyappa who observe a vow for forty one days). I read in book by SK Ramachandra Rao that one mandala equals 48 days. He has not quoted any pramana for this. What is the actual duration of mandala? I request scholars of this group to clear my doubt.  



regards  
shankara
