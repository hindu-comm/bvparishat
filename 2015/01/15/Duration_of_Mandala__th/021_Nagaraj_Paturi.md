Thanks to Prof R N Iyengar for resolving the issue by reminding us all that



The reference in the TA is to the Sun as SuryamaNDala.



I was looking for the usage of the word maNDala in the sense of a certain duration of days in Vedic referenceswithout realizing that usage of the word in any meaning in Vedic reference would resolve the issue.
