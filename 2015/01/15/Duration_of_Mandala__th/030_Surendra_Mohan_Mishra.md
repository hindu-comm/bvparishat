namo bhA-ratavidvadbhyaH !  
My humble note:  
1. Generally the word 'maNDala' denotes a wholesome section in space or time.  
2. The universal reality obtaining is termed as 'akhaNDamaNDalam'.  
3. As certain texts are quoted, one can also look at the number 40 in  
R.V. Indra sUktam: 'catvAriM'sýAM sáradi anvavindan'. What is so  
sacrosanct about the years being 40 ?  
4. In Odia language colloquial use the word 'khaNDamaNDala' has a spatial sense.  
5. Acc. to MBh. text Bhishma lied down on the bed of arrows for 58  
nights: Is it 40+18 ?  
6. All 10 fingers spread and held up appear in maNDalAkriti. Could  
thus 40 be a derivative of 10 ?  
7. The plexuses - cakras- are from a 4-petalled lotus to a 1000  
petalled lotus at the sahasrAra. The number 4 could represent the 4  
directions and thus 'akhaNDamaNDala' !  
8. The Chinese or Tibbetan rendering of maNdala must have some  
numerical tradition attached to it. As I find, in our maNDala-s in  
smArta karmakANDa, a navagraha-maNDala has 9 or 27 boxed spaces, in a  
sarvatobhadra one it is 54, in a rudra it is again 27 or 64 and so on.  
9. Since the numbers assigned to a 'maNDala'varies in different  
situations: 20,21,40,41 and 48, other numbers arrived at elsewhere may  
be looke up.  
10. In NyAya-Vaiséshika, a 'parimaNDala' means an atom or a dyad and  
it's size is 'pArimANDalya'. In that respect the meaning of  
'maNDala'also has to be understood.  
Best regards,  
SMMishra

\> Before concluding mail I would like to add another MANTRA SASTRA citation  
\> from SARADA TILAKA TANTRA which has reference to the relation of MANDALA and  

\> 40.This reference can be seen in the Third PATALA (Slokas 29, 30 and 31) of  

\> Sarada Tilaka Tantra in the context of MANDAPA Nirmana as a part of Diksha  
\> Vidhi. While structuring a MANDAPA in its Northern part A secret SALA is to  
\> me constructed in which a MANDALA racana should be made. That MANDALA racana  
\> should be according to the following slokas. मण्डपस्योत्तरे भागे शालां  
\> पूर्वापरायताम्।गूढां कुर्य्यात् ततस्तस्यां मण्डलं रचयेत्  
\> बुधै:॥२९॥पञ्चहस्तप्रमणानि पञ्चसूत्राणि पातयेत्।पूर्वापरायतान्येषामन्तरं  
\> द्वादशाङ्गुलम्॥३०॥दक्षिणोत्तरसूत्राणि तद्वदेकादशार्पयेत्।पदानि तत्र जायन्ते  
\> चत्वारिंशत् प्रमार्जयेत्॥ ३१॥  
\> The drawing of said mandala should be according to the following  
\> description. FIVE straight lines of FIVE hand-lengths each should be laid  
\> down on the ground spreading from east to west. The gap between line and  
\> line should be 12 Angulams. (Of these FIVE lines the 1st and 5th are outer  

\> lines)Then across these five lines ELEVEN lines should be drawan spreading  

\> from North to South. (Of these ELEVEN lines the 1st and 11th are outer  
\> lines). Then this drawing will form with 40 rectangular cells in it. This  
\> drawing with 40 rectangular cells is called a MANDALA. So citation also may  
\> help to draw some inference in support of the the relation of MANDALA and  

\> 40.I too eagerly wait for further postings indicating the relation between  

\> MANDALA and the numbers - 40 or 41 or 48.Warm regards,Dr. Rani Sadasiva
