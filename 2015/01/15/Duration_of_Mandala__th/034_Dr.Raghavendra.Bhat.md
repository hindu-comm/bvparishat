Namaste !

As Prof.Nagaraj Paturi ji said Mandala is 40days in HathaYoga.

As in Hathapridipika -

**"मण्डलाद्दृश्यते सिद्धिः कुन्द्ल्यभ्यासयोगिनः \|\| III-117\|\|**

(Page No 123 -Chapter III.

**Kaivalyadhama S.M.Y.M Samiti, Lonavla, Pune;1970 &1998**)

In same page it is also mentioned that

"**Brihmananda considers MANDALA to be period of 40 days**."..

As per my knowledge is concern few DATTATREYA followers are also considers their Mandala Deeksha for 40 days only..

Dhanyavaadah.
