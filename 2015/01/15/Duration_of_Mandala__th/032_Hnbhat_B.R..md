Thanks for winding up the discussion, Mr. Paturi.  
  
Now the question becomes focussed whetherf the duration of mandala, as  
in practice, 41 days or 48 days, is without any "pramana" so far  
examined or misleading without any base? This was the purport of the  
questionin the purpous and not any definition or derivation by which  
the "mandala" would give any other number or numbers.  
  
I too have heard both these calculations of the period of Mandala,  
though the word may mean many other things or numbers or period of  
days. Mandala used in practice, was centered on the duration of a  
period of a number of days, and I have heard in my childhood, it was  
48 days of period.  
  
I had raised a questioin in an earlier post, what does the division of  
"mandala" in the system of divsion, mandala, adhyayam sukta or  
mandala, ashtaka, varga stand for in the Rigveda samhita? Does it  
denote a consistent number of the sub group or a random division  
without any fixed number in the group? In the second case, it may  
denote any number constained in the "mandala" which has only a  
meaning, collection or a name for a collection of sub categories if  
any and not any specific number attached to it. It depends on the  
group or period of days contained during the course, in which a  
ceremony or pooja is used to be celebrated or vrata to be performed in  
practiced in the region. SKRao could have added the remark as 48 days  
according to the practice in his region. I too have of "mandala" pooja  
in a temple, during which a procession is popular that the place  
became known as volasari, meaning procession in Tulu region, for the  
temple itself and mandalapooja in houses, took place for 48 days,  
durgapuja, during a particular season. And myself do not know how the  
number came to be attached to the word.  
  
I came to know of 41 days only from the Ayyappa devotees' practice in  
Kerala. But I was too young then, to ask for any "pramana" for the  
practice.  
  
By bhutadisamkhya, it may not be consistent in its use, it can be 12  
dvadasha mandala, or as by Ayurveda, it may be a mandala of 40 days,  
according to the practice of the Ayurvedic physicians, it may vary  
accoring to the nature of the illness treated, the duration of the  
course of treatment may vary. Anyhow I am not a practitioner of  
Ayurveda of astronomy. The case of loka, can be used for 3, 7 or 14 or  
more on another consideration and the word mandala may denote any  
number on its usage in the context of each Shastra.  
  
This is my reflection on reading all the posts.
