Thanks to Sri HN Bhat mahodaya for rightly reminding the participants in the current discussion not to deviate from the main expected point.

Yes.  I try to reconcile the progressive views of all scholars in this context.

At the out set let me quote the first question of this thread of discussion:

"I have heard that one mandala equals forty one days (as in the case of devotees of Ayyappa who observe a vow for forty one days). I read in book by SK Ramachandra Rao that one mandala equals 48 days. He has not quoted any pramana for this. **What is the actual duration of mandala?** I request scholars of this group to clear my doubt."

After a keen observation it seems that this question has given some freedom to the scholars to say about the actual duration of MANDALA. 

  

**As far as the practice in Ayurveda and Mantra Sastra are concerned Mandala Dinani (while using a medicine) or Mandala Diksha (while consecration of chanting some specific Mantras) the duration is popularly restricted to 40 only and neither to 41 nor to 48.**

So here a search for how the word MANDALA stands for 40 need not be out of context. 

  

Moreover SRI SHANKARA MAHODAYA who triggered out this question also seems convinced to accept any sources in support of MANDALA representing 40. From this point of view also any arguments supporting MANDALA =40 if advanced by any scholars it may not be out of the context.

  

Further to add, in the attempt of finding out supporting passages for 'MANDALA = 40' various shades of meanings available in NIGHANTUS are observed mentioned by different scholars in their respective mails. 

Here also a reason which may not be denied can be traced out:

BHUTADI system i.e. using words for representing numbers is not out of practice in various Sastras in Sanskrit. For instance: SURYA for 12, Asva for 7, RUDRA for 11, RASA for 6 or 9 depending on the context and so on are popularly used.

Hence it can be inferred from all the mails that the word MANDALA primarily refers to an extent of land covering 40 yojanas length and consequently according to BHUTADI system MANDALA might have been used to represent the number 40.

  

Before concluding mail I would like to add another MANTRA SASTRA citation from SARADA TILAKA TANTRA which has reference to the relation of MANDALA and 40.

This reference can be seen in the Third PATALA (Slokas 29, 30 and 31) of Sarada Tilaka Tantra in the context of MANDAPA Nirmana as a part of Diksha Vidhi. While structuring a MANDAPA in its Northern part A secret SALA is to me constructed in which a MANDALA racana should be made. That MANDALA racana should be according to the following slokas. 

मण्डपस्योत्तरे भागे शालां पूर्वापरायताम्।

गूढां कुर्य्यात् ततस्तस्यां मण्डलं रचयेत् बुधै:॥२९॥

पञ्चहस्तप्रमणानि पञ्चसूत्राणि पातयेत्।

पूर्वापरायतान्येषामन्तरं द्वादशाङ्गुलम्॥३०॥

दक्षिणोत्तरसूत्राणि तद्वदेकादशार्पयेत्।

पदानि तत्र जायन्ते चत्वारिंशत् प्रमार्जयेत्॥ ३१॥

  

The drawing of said mandala should be according to the following description. FIVE straight lines of FIVE hand-lengths each should be laid down on the ground spreading from east to west. The gap between line and line should be 12 Angulams. (Of these FIVE lines the 1st and 5th are outer lines)

Then across these five lines ELEVEN lines should be drawan spreading from North to South. (Of these ELEVEN lines the 1st and 11th are outer lines). Then this drawing will form with 40 rectangular cells in it. This drawing with 40 rectangular cells is called a MANDALA. So citation also may help to draw some inference in support of the the relation of MANDALA and 40.

I too eagerly wait for further postings indicating the relation between MANDALA and the numbers - 40 or 41 or 48.

Warm regards,

**Dr. Rani Sadasiva Murty**
