This difference of 40/41 and 48 period of days constituting the  
duration has been discussed in many places.  
  
<http://www.ishafoundation.org/blog/yoga-meditation/demystifying-yoga/making-hata-yogi-establishing-practice/>  
  
The above link refers to 40-48 days durationb of the session called mandala.  
  
You undertake a ‘vow’ and complete it in 48 days, like staying  
in silence within a temple with or without food; or, going round Arunachala  
Hill for 48 days – one a day, without a break.  
  
This is the practice in Arunachala where the rounding of the hill on  
full moon days, while the practice in shabarimala, is the duration of  
41 days and not 40 or 48.  
  
Only the best reply is that it depends on the religious practice of  
the region in the temples in respect of the festival days during which  
the special pooja is performed.  
  
The practice of cycle of mandala, is discussed in reddig group also:  
  
<http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/14sky7/full_mandala_cycle_48_days_report_the_secret_to/>  
  
But none of these refer to a cycle of 40 days and most  
participants/informants are not Sanskrit Scholars. Hence could not  
give any written evidence for their practice. Here is a report of  
mandala pooja for 48 days.  
  
  
  
I have myself witnessed the mandalapooja, period, for the period of 48  
days from the month of Vrischika 1 ending with dhanu 18, i.e. This  
year on January 2, in our region. My brother-in-law used to do the  
special pooja during the 48 days while the permenant priest performs  
on other days.  
  
By some it is considered an 48 auspicious number for ritual purposes  
as the reports on Google on mandalapooja suggest. And here is one more  
discussion  
  
<https://quantumwellnessinc.wordpress.com/2013/06/06/discover-the-healing-aspects-of-mandalas-and-light-energy/>  
  
Just googled. with mandala + days.  
  
In short there is no fixed days of numbers, but either 41 and 48 it  
varies in practice.
