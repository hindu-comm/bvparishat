After Prof. Rani Sadasiva Murtyji's posts on this subject, may I reflect as follows:



1\. Prof. Rani's posts confirm that the idea of mandala is centred around the number 40 only. I am happy to have said very early in the thread :

"The word mandala as a description of time duration is 40 days only. 41 comes as 40+1 and 48 comes as 41+7 only. Adding 1 to 40 and another 7 to that 41seem to befurther developments based on the foundation of 40."



2\. I am happy to have kept the focus of the thread around the thread initiator's emphasis expressed as :



"Please read definition of the term 'mandala' as definition of ***duration*** of mandala."



3. I am happy to have said that I was waiting for Bhishaks with expectation that the answer could come from the field of Ayurveda. Prof. Rani's answers have come from his Ayurveda only.



4. **A good take away from the thread seems to be Prof. Rani's** :



"Hence it can be inferred from all the mails that the word MANDALA primarily refers to an extent of land covering 40 yojanas length and consequently according to BHUTADI system MANDALA might have been used to represent the number 40."



But may we recollect that this was rightly guessed by vidwan Shankaraji to be the possible source of mandala as 40 days when he brought the vaachaspatya definition.



The same thing was confirmed by Prof. Raniji as his learning from childhood at home.



5. Though till now no textual reference with exact info of maNDala as duration of time is 40 days only, Prof. Rani's documentation of his
learning through oral tradition of Ayurveda and Mantra s'Astra tradition can be taken as some evidence in this direction.
