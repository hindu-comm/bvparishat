The plausible reason for the difference of the "(48 - 41) =seven" counts could be as follows:  
  
If the Mandala Vrata is for propitiating the individual deities, the seven out of the nine grahas, already get invoked while invoking the 27 Nakshatras and the 12 Rashis. For example, Budha is the ruler of the "Revati" Nakshatra as well as of the "Mithun" Rashi.
