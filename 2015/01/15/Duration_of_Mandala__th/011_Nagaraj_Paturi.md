Mandala is used basically for a circle, as an extension for any enclosed area or its circumference ( e.g. chaturasraakaaramaNDalam kritvaa etc. used in vedic rituals)

  

As a metaphorical extension, it is used for 'a round' of tratment in Ayurveda. Usual maNDala in Ayurveda or haTha yoga is 40 days. But some Ayurvedic books say that the duration of the maNDala can be decided by the bhishak from case to case, though the usual duration is 40 days.

  

Another metaphorical extension from the basic meaning of circle is time cycle.
