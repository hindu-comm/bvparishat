Good note for many young scholars raising queries to keep in mind. It  
would have saved the efforts and valuable time of the scholars who  
tried in answering the question.  
  
This applies to all the future queries and also many such queries placed before.  
  
Thanks to Paturi for the good suggestion and now it is up to the  
members to follow the suggestion of a senior member so that the  
efforts of the members could be focussed on what is needed to be known  
by the query.
