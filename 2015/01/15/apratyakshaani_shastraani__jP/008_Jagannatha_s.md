Sri Dipak Bhattacharyavarya has mentioned parokshapriyaa hi devaah with explanation.Thanks.

Apratyakshatva in my post is related to the concepts punya, paapa, svarga naraka etc.. In Jyautisha at least Sun and moon (and of course,planets and stars also ) are pratyaksha. But all most all the concepts in other shastras are tarkasiddha and generate heated arguments. That is the meaning of the verse.Meaning is clear. But I questioned how only jyautisha is pratyaksha ?

All the shastras(not the subjects they deal with) are pratyaksha ! The subject matters may be pratyaksha or paroksha. Sri Nagaraj Paturi varya has already said it.
