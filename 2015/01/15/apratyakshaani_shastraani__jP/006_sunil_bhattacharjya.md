Namaste,  
  

Even in Astronomy, some facts seem to be indirectly mentioned in Shastra. For example RV mentions about the seven children of the Sun. These, to my knowledge, have been interpreted to be the seven grahas,leaving out the eighth **Swarabhanu** (the astrological duo of *Rahu and Ketu*) and the ninth **Ketu** (the comet), out of the Navagrahas. Kindly note that the Sun exchanges place with the Earth in the geocentric representation, as applied in Astrology.  
  

Regards,
