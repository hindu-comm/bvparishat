One very often comes upon the saying in the Brāhmaṇas परोक्षप्रिया हि देवाः प्रत्यक्षद्विषः। This is said in defence of the interpretation of Brāhmaṇa passages as containing an inner meaning indirectly indicating the ritual employment. Indirectly telling is often found in Indian literature. In the Divyāvadāna one finds अभेदेन व्याकरणम् in this sense. Is the अप्रत्यक्षत्व spoken of here in anyway related to that?
