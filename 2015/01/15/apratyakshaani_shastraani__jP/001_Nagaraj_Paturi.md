This kind of distinction can be seen in modern academic disciplines too.

  

Obviously, this verse comes from a lover of astronomy. But there are many other traditional Indian academic disciplines that deal with concrete objects and their analysis. Most other S'astras work through abstractions and abstract concepts though exemplified by , among other things, concrete entities.

  

Jaati, dravya, samyoga, samavaaya etc. are all abstract concepts. But their discussion needs examples of ghaTa, paTa and other such concrete entities only. Some people have dislike for too much of abstract nature of discussion. The maker of this verse seems to be one such.
