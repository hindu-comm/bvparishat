Vidwan Jagannathaji,



I agree with both your posts in saying that the verse is classifying the shaastras into pratyaksha and apratyaksha on the basis of the pratyakshatva and apratyakshatva of the subject matter of the shaastras (शास्त्रशब्दात् शास्त्रप्रतिपाद्यवस्तु इत्यर्थो निःसारणीयः )only.



But to take the discussion further, we may observe that mere चंद्रार्कौ is not the subject matter of ज्यौतिषम् . Even if we take that चंद्रार्कौ here through लक्षणा stand for all the celestial bodies, we can see that subject matter of astronomy is not limited to those bodies but includes eventhe concepts andtheorizations about those bodies. These concepts and theorizations are apratyaksha only.



Similarly, those shaastras which are being considered as apratyaksha here may deal with apratyaksha concepts such as jaati, dravya,sankhyaa etc., but theseapratyaksha concepts are exemplified through pratyaksha vastus such as ghaTa, paTa only.



So even if we conclude that शास्त्रशब्दात् शास्त्रप्रतिपाद्यवस्तु इत्यर्थो निःसारणीयः as rightly observed by you, to classify शास्त्रप्रतिपाद्यवस्तु into pratyaksha and apratyaksha is not an easy task.
