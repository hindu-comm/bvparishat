In Hari suri’s shri Bhakti Rasayanam -there is a श्लोक: which explains for Shri Krishna being born in “रोहिणी “नक्षत्र

  

यास्यु: पूर्वजवल्लभा: सुमहिलास्ताश्चात्र सर्वा अपि

सत्पुत्रा मम जन्मना भुवि यथा स्यद्वा न सापत्न्यकं ।

रामे ज्येष्टजनौ च तादृगधुना सत्कार्यमित्यच्युतो

रोहिण्यां निशि चाविरास युगपत् सद्देवकीयोदरे ॥

for 10-3-8  

But Balarama or Sankarshana is known to have married Revati-daughter of Raivata. In purana there is no mention of his marrying anybody else.

If "पूर्वज" refers to an elder brother it has to be interpreted as Balarama. If it refers to Chandra in whose race Krishna was born the meaning does not lead to a logical interpretation.

As रोहिणी is Vasudeva's wife and Balaramas mother as well krishna's birth in rohini nakshatra is logical.

Will anybody help in understanding the real purport of the poet?
