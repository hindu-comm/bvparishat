Thank you Sri. HN.BHAT,Sir for your clarification presumably from Shabdakalpadrumam.

Perhaps the intention of Sri Hari Suri is to say that all theपितर:- and मातर: who are born on the earth at that time were expecting their progeny to haveसत्पुत्रा .

Can we interpretपूर्वजवल्लभा: to include Vasudeva's other wives?

Then onlyस्याद्वा न सापत्न्यकं - will fit in this verse.

This is my opinion. If wrong,what could be the intention of the poet in saying स्याद्वा न सापत्न्यकं ?

If you inform me I will be thankful.
