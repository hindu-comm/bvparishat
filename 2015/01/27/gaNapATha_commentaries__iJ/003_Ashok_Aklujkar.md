For Prof. Wakankar:

Prof. Palsule worked on the Dhaatu-paa.tha. I do not recall any work of his on the Ga.na-paa.tha. Perhaps scholars who have been continuously living in Pune can update my information.

  

For Dr. Dhaval Patel:

The following has much information on modern studies of the Ga.na-paa.tha:

Cardona, George. 1976. Paa.nini, a Survey of Research. The Hague-Paris: Mouton. Indian reprint, 1980, 1997. Delhi, etc.: Motilal Banarsidass. See especially pp. 164-167.

For traditional commentaries etc. on the Ga.na-paa.tha, see

Yudhi.s.thira Miimaa.msaka.Sa.msk.rta Vyaakara.na-;saastra kaa Itihaasa. \[Most recent edition known to me, the 4th one:\] 1984 \[sa.mvat 2041\] Bahalagadha, Harayana: Author. Distributor: Ramalala Kapura Trust. Vol. 2, pp. 144-201. The fifth“edition” 1994 \[sa.mvat 2051\]is probably only a photographic reprint of the fourth edn.
