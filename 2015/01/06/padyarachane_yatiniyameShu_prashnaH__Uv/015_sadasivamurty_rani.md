A humble submission to the scholars of this thread.

This thread 1. As the subject title of the thread does indicate and 2. As per the requirement of the initiator this thread - relates to the Yati Niyamas.

  

To the extent of my knowledge in Sanskrit Prosody I tried to give a suitable reply to the context.

  

In the process of giving a reply to the question in the thread - inattentively I typed "tha" for "dha" . (Artha for Ardha).

  

Soon it was pointed out by one of our learned members I thanked him and confessed for my mistake also. (The main reason for such typos is : I have been suffering from TENNIS ELBOW. It prevents me to type comfortably.)

  

Even after my confession the discussion is focussed in this thread on the Phonetic disorders in different languages only having left away the main problem of the thread.

  

Aren't we sidetracking ourselves?

  

I don't know whether the information extended by me meets the expectations of the initiator of this thread.

  

I request you all to help me to understand where we have left the main nerve of this thread and whether the information uploaded by me is useful to the thread initiator.



Regards,

**Prof. Rani Sadasiva Murty**
