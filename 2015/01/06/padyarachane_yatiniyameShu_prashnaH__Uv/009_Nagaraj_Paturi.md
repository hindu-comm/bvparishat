I know the sense of humour of AadaraNIya Nityanandji here.

  

yes, you are right. Such mother tongue interferences are common among all Indian languages while pronouncing Sanskrit loan words.

  

But there is a method in the g/k/h, p/b pronunciation. It is not as simple as they are pronounced interchangeably.

  

  

  

g,k,h are allophones to each other and make phoneme in Tamil. Where the phoneme takes which of the forms g,k or h has rules of occurrence.
