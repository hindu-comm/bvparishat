Namaste

क्षर सञ्चलने, अट गतौ etc. have an akAra in the end, which is neither a part of dhAtu (like that if कथ) nor an anubandha (like that of एध).

It is just for मुखसुखार्थं (or सुखोच्चारणार्थं)।

Shri Janardana Hegde sir's धातुरूपनन्दिनी, उपोद्घात page. iv explains this point.

And also कृष्णाचार्य बृहद्धातुरूपावलिः explains same in same manner. (snippet attached)

How do we make out if that adantatva of a halanta dhAtu is for a purpose or just pronunciation help.

By seeing commentaries at that particular dhAtu?

Or can it be got as a statement anywhere, which would help in recognizing each such dhAtu?

Thankyou in advance.
