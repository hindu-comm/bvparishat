I think there is not much confusion. There are only few in the 10th  
class and hence it is decided by the presence and absence of ata  
upadhaayaa vriddhi.  
  
  
अचीचहत्। कथादौ वक्ष्यमाणस्य तु अदन्तात्वेनाग्लोपित्वाद्दीर्घसन्वद्भावौ  
न। अचचहत्।  
  
Only by the difference of the forms in the usage and the forms given  
in Vritti-s in its nic suffixed forms.  
  
I think there is no other way. jap jaapayati, etc. and only in  
kathaadi, these will take take place, mitaam hrasva, in ghataadi. and  
otherwise all the halant verbs will take ata aadeH vriddhi. Probably  
the Vritti-s give.  
  
Other members may suggest some other means to identify.
