Finally managed to decode the verse after days of meditation upon it . There is a very tricky wordplay involved in the final line. Here is my interpretation :

  

**\[Krishna was thinking as follows\]:**  

  

**याः स्युः पूर्वजवल्लभाः सुमहिलाः** = Those auspicious \[27 constellation\] ladies who are the wives of my **पूर्वज** \[named **चन्द्रमा**\]

  

**ताश्चात्र सर्वा अपि** = all of them too

  

**सत्पुत्रा मम जन्मना भुवि यथा स्यात्** = should automatically become mothers of a **सत्पुत्र** due to my accepting birth on earth

  

**वा न सापत्न्यकम्** = and there should be no **सापत्न्य** i.e. feeling of jealousy among them

  

**रामे ज्येष्ठजनौ च** = and especially when Balaram is already born as the elder brother \[in Rohiṇī's womb\]

  

**तादृगधुना सत्कार्यम्** = therefore \[in my birth\] I should carry out such an auspicious task \[to ensure that all 27 wives ofचन्द्रमाare satisfied and there is no enmity among them.\]

  

**इत्यच्युतः** = thinking like this our Lord Achyuta

  

**रोहिण्यां निशि चाविरास** = appeared at night in the constellation named Rohiṇī (one of the wives of the moon)

  

**युगपत् सद्देवकीयोदरे** = and simultaneously in the womb of beautiful **देवकीया** (word play on this last term).

  

The final term**देवकीयोदरे** has two meanings — **(1)** in the womb belonging to**देवकी** ; **(2)** In the womb of**देवकीया** .

  

The term**देवकीया** is grammatically derived by the Vārttika rule —**देवस्य चेतिवक्तव्यम्** (**found in Kāśikā 4.2.138 etc.**). According to this rule,**देवकीया**means — "**belonging toदेव**".

  

Belonging to which**देव** ? Obviously **चन्द्रदेव** . So**देवकीया** here refers to all other 26 wives who belong to **चन्द्रदेव**.

  

It is well known thatचन्द्र was excessively attached to only one wife i.e. Rohiṇī. This caused **सापत्न्य** (jealousy) in the other 26 wives. Now Balaram has again appeared as the elder brother in the womb of Rohiṇī. This can further fuel the**सापत्न्य**.Krishna is thus thinking that he should appear in such a way that his birth should make all the 27 wives of चन्द्र think that he has appeared from their womb (including Rohiṇī). Thus Krishna appeared simultaneously in Rohiṇī (Nakṣatra) as well as in the womb of**देवकीया** (all other wives belonging to**चन्द्रदेव**)****.

  

Hope this sheds some light.
