Dear Shri Venkata Subramanianji,  
  

People often make a mistake thinking that a particular person cannot be wrong. Suri was a human being and we know the adage "To err is human".
You appeared to have attempted to certify Suri saying that Suri was a spiritual person and he cannot be wrong. You seem to interpret things strongly in favour of Suri. That is why I requested you to tell me about Suri's spiritual credentialis but you did not help. That compelled me to write the rejoinder. What I was telling was that Suri was not right and gave the reasons for that. The great lady Rohini was not the same as the Rohini Nakshatra.  
  
I have no animosity with Suri. I am a seeker of the truth and that is why I was bold to express my views, even though these could be different from those of the other scholars.  
  

Regards,  

Sunil KB

TO SRI.SUNIL BHATTACHARJYA,JI,

With humility and modesty at my command, I would request you to explain the meaning of the verse I have referred to.

I am not a scholar or pandit to assess as to who is right or who is wrong.

I am very clear in my mind that there is no question of any enmity between Balarama and Krishna.Neither Hari Suri , nor the Purana nor any commentator says so.

I was trying to find out the meaning of the verse from the poet's point of view.

I am neither qualified nor competent to judge " HARI SURI". He does not need my certificate .

If you can explain to me the meaning of the verse, I will be thankful.

If you do not prefer to do that, I request you to rest the matter in peace.

Thanking you

N.S.VENKATA SUBRAMANIAN
