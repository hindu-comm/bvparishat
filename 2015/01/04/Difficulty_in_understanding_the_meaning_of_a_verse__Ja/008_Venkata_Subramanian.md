TO SRI.SUNIL BHATTACHARJYA,JI,

With humility and modesty at my command, I would request you to explain the meaning of the verse I have referred to.

I am not a scholar or pandit to assess as to who is right or who is wrong.

I am very clear in my mind that there is no question of any enmity between Balarama and Krishna.Neither Hari Suri , nor the Purana nor any commentator says so.

I was trying to find out the meaning of the verse from the poet's point of view.

I am neither qualified nor competent to judge " HARI SURI". He does not need my certificate .

If you can explain to me the meaning of the verse, I will be thankful.

If you do not prefer to do that, I request you to rest the matter in peace.

Thanking you

N.S.VENKATA SUBRAMANIAN
