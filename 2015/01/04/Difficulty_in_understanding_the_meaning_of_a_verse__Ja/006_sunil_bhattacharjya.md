Sorry friends,  
  
There was a typo. the following line  

Quote

  
From Krisnashtami to Shuklashtami, more than half of the Moon is bright, and that is the period when the pitris sleep.  

Unquote  
  

should be read as below:  
  
**From Shuklashtami to Krishnashtami, more than half of the Moon is bright, and that is the period when the pitris sleep. So Krishna's birth at that time delighted the gods and not necessarily the pitris.**
