Dear Venkata Sobramanianji,  

  
One cannot ignore the importance of the Rohini nakshatra, which is ruled by Brahma and its importance further rose after the disappearance of the Abhijit. Further spiritually the Moon (Chandra) is considered to be an avatara of Brahma and that is how Rohini becomes the own house of the Moon too. As regards the Moon spending more time in Rohini, another theory says that the Moon could have a better look at his most beautiful wife Chitra (with her good figure and beautiful eyes, as all chitra-born ladies have), from the house of Rohini. Hope you are aware that the grahas are known to be unable to look at the house they visit and they can look on the opposite side.  
  

Further it is difficult to buy the story that there can be any chance of enmity between Balarama and Krishna (even though their being vaimatrika) as the spiritual position is that Balarama, Pradyumna and Aniruddha are spiritual beings and belong to the four parts (amshas) of Vasudeva only.  
  

Therefore, with all regards to Suri and Bhatji, can we agree to disagree? Further it will be good if you can enlighten me about the spiritual attainments of Suri or give the references, so that I can have a look at them  
  

Thanking you in advance and with regards,
