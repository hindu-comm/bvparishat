Dear Venkata Subramanianji,  
  

Thank you for your quick response.  
**!)**  

As regards Abhijit, Suri did not mention about this Brahma--nakshatra. It could be that Suri did not know that Rohini and Abhijit are the Brahma-nakshatras. I did only to inform you that one cannot ignore the fact that Rohini is a Brahma-nakshatra, the other Brahma-nakshatra being Abhijit, which disappeared around the time of Lord Krishna. Mahabharata called that the rashi with the Abhijit nakshatra as the Brahma-rashi. So exalted was the status of the Brahma-rashi, Abhijit nakshatra, that the gods could defeat the asuras by timing their expedition in Abhijit. Lord Krishna is said to have plucked out the Abhijit, to prevent itsmisuse in future by unscrupulous people,nowever the scientists of the TIFR maintains that the Abhiji was a bright supernova that faded out about 5,000 years ago.

Neither Hari Suri, nor Sri. H.N Bhatt , nor I have not suggested or mentioned that there is or was a possibility of enmity between Balarama and Krishna .

Further if you read the first half of the verse the poet infers that Krishna wanted to assure the wives of His ancestors - who wished that they should get good progeny and there should be harmony among themselves not a feeling of enmity.

Such a desire is perfectly logical.

In the beginning you said that none of you indicated any possibility of enmity between Balarama and Krishna. Then you have contradicted that by saying that there was the need for Lord Krishna to assure the wives of the ancestors that he took birth in the Rohini nakshatra and it would ensure that there would be no enmity between Balarama and Krishna.  
  

Secondly, is it not preposterous to assume the human being Rohini to be
the same as the Rohini nakshatra ?

And also in the mid night when Moon rises to show that He has regard and consideration for His ancestors.

**From Shuklashtami to Krishnashtami, more than half of the Moon is bright, and that is the period when the pitris sleep. So Krishna's birth at that time delighted the gods and not necessarily the pitris.**This topic has been discussed earlier in BVP. With all regards to you and others, please permit me to agree to disagree with you.
