 Forदशम स्कन्ध -अध्याय ३- श्लोक ८ of Srimad Baghavatam

  

निशीथे तम उद्भूते जायमाने जनार्दने ।

देवक्यां देवरूपिण्यां विष्णु: सर्वगुहाशय: ।

आविरासीत् यथा प्राच्यां दिशीन्दुरिव पुष्कल: ॥

there are various commentaries for this verse.

श्री हरि सूरि in his commentary for this verse in श्रीभक्ति रसायनं has given various reasons for Shri Krishna being born in Rohini Nakshatra and in mid night. In verse no 94 he gives one of the reasons as below:  

  

यास्यु: पूर्वजवल्लभा: सुमहिलास्ताश्चात्र सर्वा अपि

सत्पुत्रा मम जन्मना भुवि यथा स्याद्वा न सापत्न्यकं ।

रामे ज्येष्टजनौ च तादृगधुना सत्कार्यमित्यच्युतो

रोहिण्यां निशि चाविरास युगपत् सद्देवकीयोदरे ॥ for 10-3-8

  

In this verse the word पूर्वजवल्लभा: if meant to be पूर्वजस्य वल्लभा ता: may mean " wives of the elder brother". If it means "पूर्वजानां वल्लभा:" it will refer to the wives of fore-fathers- दिव्य पितृगणा: तत् पर्याय: पितर:.

The diffiulty I face is this: 1) Sri Balarama had married only one wife. So his having more wives does not arise. Hence reference to Balarama will be absurd.

2) If it means the wives of the fore-fathers, it may mean Vasudeva. But the difficulty in this case is -Why Vasudeva is referred to as पूर्वज ? Not as जनक?

3) If it means the wives of चन्द्र , the meaning is absurd again as the other wives of चन्द्र -all the stars except रोहिणी are never mentioned in the Purana.

If it refers to the wives of His fore fathers who are born the reference to रोहिणी subsequently does not make sense.

WHAT IS THE POET'S INTENTION IN THIS VERSE?

I request the scholars in this forum to help me in understanding the meaning of this verse.
