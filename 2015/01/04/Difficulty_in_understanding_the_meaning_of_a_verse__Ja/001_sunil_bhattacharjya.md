Namaste,

Your question is really baffling, yet I wish to give it a try. Hope the constructive members will help me, where I go wrong.

The Verse in the Bhagavata purana (10.3.8) can probably be translated as below:

In the dark night (midnight) Janârdana, the Vishnu, who resides in the hearts of all, appeared from the divine-form of Devakî, in full manifestation, like the bright Moon rising in the East.

The points to be considered are as follows :  

**  
**1)  

The Lord was born in the midnight on the Krishnashtami night and coincidentially in the Krishnashtami tithi the Moon rises at midnight, removing the darkness of the night.  
2)  

The Lord was born in the Rohini nakshatra, which is ruled by Brahma. By the time of Mahabharata, the other nakshatra, Abhijit (also ruled Brahma) disappeared and this has been corroborated by the astronomical studies carried out by the scientists of TIFR. I understand that the disappearance of Abhijit is mentioned in some texts from the Southern states of India.  
3)  

It is a fact that Lord Krishna's purvaja (older brother) was Balaram and Balaram's dearest was his mother was Rohini, who in turn was the first wife of Vasudeva and hence she was the Sapatni of Devaki. Probably Suri was trying to find a relation between this fact and the Rohini nakshatra.  

My personal view is that Suri was not right in his interpretation.

Regards,
