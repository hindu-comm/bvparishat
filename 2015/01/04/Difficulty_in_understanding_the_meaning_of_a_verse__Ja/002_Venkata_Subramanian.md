Re: {भारतीयविद्वत्परिषत्} Re: HariSuri's Bhakti Rasayanam- interpretation of a shloka

Translate message to English

४ चन्द्रलोकस्थे दिव्यपितृगणे “अथ

पूर्ब(र्व)जाः” पितरश्चन्द्रगोलस्था न्यस्तशस्त्राः स्वधाभुजः ।

कव्यबालादयस्ते च” त्रिका० ।

  

This is the source for explaining पूर्वजाः = पितरः\|

To Sri Gitarti,

Please see the reply of Sri.H.N .Bhatt which is very clear for the interpretation of "पूर्वजानां वल्लभा ". Sri.Hari Suri is best known for his mastery of scriptures. HENCE he may not be wrong in his interpretation.

What he wishes to state is that Bhaghawan Sri Krishna chose Rohini Nakshatra and mid night of Ashtami-when the moon rises only to remove any enmity among brothers- commonly known to be present among co- brothers - "स्याद्वा न सापत्न्यकं ".

He wishes to convey that the manes or fore-fathers in ithe Chandraloka wished that the co-brothers to be friendly. That explains the choice of Rohini Nakshatra . Rohini is known to be a favourite wife of Chandra and the remainnig stars - 26 stars are the co-wives of Rohini - By taking birth in Rohini Nakshatra, Sri Krishna will see to that no enmity takes place and will ensure harmony among the persons born under different stars.

The above is my inference and understanding of the verse.

Please consider from the various angles the probable meanings of the statement in the verse.

Thank you very much for your reply and observations
