यास्यु: पूर्वजवल्लभा: सुमहिलास्ताश्चात्र सर्वा अपि

सत्पुत्रा मम जन्मना भुवि यथा स्यद्वा न सापत्न्यकं ।

रामे ज्येष्टजनौ च तादृगधुना सत्कार्यमित्यच्युतो

रोहिण्यां निशि चाविरास युगपत् सद्देवकीयोदरे ॥ for 10-3-8

Dear Sri. Gitarji ji,

Thank you very much for your quick response and clarifications.

Neither Hari Suri, nor Sri. H.N Bhatt , nor I have not suggested or mentioned that there is or was a possibility of enmity between Balarama and Krishna .

Further if you read the first half of the verse the poet infers that Krishna wanted to assure the wives of His ancestors - who wished that they should get good progeny and there should be harmony among themselves not a feeling of enmity.

Such a desire is perfectly logical. Krishna wanted to assure them with His birth.

यास्यु: पूर्वजवल्लभा: सुमहिलास्ताश्चात्र सर्वा अपि

सत्पुत्रा मम जन्मना भुवि यथा स्याद्वा न सापत्न्यकं ।

Now let us see the other half.

रामे ज्येष्टजनौ च तादृगधुना सत्कार्यमित्यच्युतो

रोहिण्यां निशि चाविरास युगपत् सद्देवकीयोदरे ॥ for 10-3-8

Now Sri Krishna fulfils their desire by taking His birth in Rohini Nakshatra and in the midnight of Krishna Paksha Ashtami when the moon (Chandra- in whose race Krishna chose His Avathara ) simultaneously. This is done after Sri Balarama took His Avathara by being born to Rohini. Incidentally Devaki also is His mother. Originally Balarama was conceived by Devaki and later the embryo was transferred to Rohini. Krishna to do a सत्कार्य - opts to be born in Rohini Nakshatra - in order to show that He considers both Rohini and Devaki as His mothers. And also in the mid night when Moon rises to show that He has regard and consideration for His ancestors.

In the PURANA , it is mentioned that Vasudeva had 13 wives - Rohini and Devaki being two among them. TO show that that there is perfect harmony He chose Rohini Nakshatra (Balarama’s mother) and Devaki also.

In my opinion this could be the intention of the poet.

I wanted to know if there could be any other reason-supported by scriptures.

There is no reference to the Abhijit Nakshata at all . For the verse no.8, in the 3rd chapter of 10 th Skandha Hari Suri's commentary has 11 verses. The above is 10th in row.

I request you to read the commentary of Hari Suri. I am confident that you will revise your opinion about it

Thank you very much
