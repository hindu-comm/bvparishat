Namaste



On the topic of news item \< Ganesha’s head transplant as proof of advanced surgical expertise in ancient India. \> and related exchanges,



On the specific observation \< knowledge to look into these original texts which are in Sanskrit> and \< translations> with a \< very high level of probability that the truth may get twisted.>

And making a call for \< the learned Sanskrit knowing Vidwan’s to come forward and give befitting replies with relevant quotes and its meanings> .



Can you please specify what the \<Sanskrit Knowing Vidwan \>, in most cases who are \< not fully aware of the nuances and technical terminology and pedagogy of Science> and the \< communication nuances of modern English> to do ?



Please make one illustrative suggestion on what and how you want the \<
Sanskrit Vidwans> to jump in and respond?



- Using an obscure layer of \< symbolism> ?

- Using \< Sanskrit Grammar nuances to interpret the words differently \> ?

- Go by \< popular understanding> ?

- Call the \< difficult text portions> as \< interpolations? \>
or \< rewrite the Puranas> ?

- Disturb or align the \< literal meaning of the text> to the
\< popular understanding and beliefs \> ?



The challenges of maintaining consistency, integrity and all the previous understanding built around the earlier version of text will need to be answered.



To begin with, it would be great help if you can show tools and methodological pointers to understand the ‘ Viswamitra Gayatri Mantra: Tatsavaituh Varenyam….’ In relation to the ‘Solar energy capturing through meditation’ – a very popular explanation of Vedic mantra explained by many \< Vidwans knowing Sanskrit-Science and Traditional practices> ? What will be the ‘Savituh Varenyam bhargah’- translated as ? OR would it be simpler to ask how to explain how Sage Vyasa
facilitated one \< embryo> to become \< one hundred Kaurva brothers> ?

The simple point is: Science and Popular belief should not be made an unwarranted cocktail. 



Regards

BVK Sastry
