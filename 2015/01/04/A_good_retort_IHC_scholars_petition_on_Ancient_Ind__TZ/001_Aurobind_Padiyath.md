The issues are being discussed at national and international levels by those mostly who has no knowledge to look into these original texts which are in Sanskrit and hence they depend upon the translations. When one cannot read and understand the original versions and give complete faith on the knowledge of the translator, there are very high level of probability that the truth may get twisted.

So it calls for the learned Sanskrit knowing Vidwans to come forward and give befitting replies with relevant quotes and its meanings. Until then these war cries on these subjects will continue
