DR. BVK Shastriji,



You are probably asking people not to mix paradigms. That is a valid suggestion.



It is also true that some scholars in their anxiety to 'prove' mythical ideas as 'scientific' created some funny ideas all svakapolakalpitas without any method or logic.



By 'Sanskrit scholars being the casuality' , if you mean Sanskrit scholars being put to pressure to be able to give 'scientific' meanings to myths and mythical ideas simply on the basis that they are Sanskrit scholars, you are right, people making such demands from Sanskrit scholars are not justified, they are not being fair towards Sanskrit scholars. Even those who are blindly accepting any svakapolakalpita explanation offered by a Sanskrit scholar or those who make fun of such scholar when he is 'proved' 'wrong' are all wrong.



Those Sanskrit scholars who are not equipped or trained to handle such issues need not feel deficient or failing. They can happily reject to venture into this domain just as normally an engineer rejects to be a doctor or vice versa.



But that need not lead to the conclusion that all the myths and mythical expressions are just 'popular beliefs' and do not contain valid ideas at all. There is a huge amount of 'scientific' (methodical and logical) literature, in various fields such as (western) philosophy, psychoanalysis (particularly Jungian), cultural anthropology etc. that helps in capturing the truth in myths. There are parallel methods within Sanskrit literature, Vedas and Vedic tradition for this purpose.



I can say this with authenticity since that is the content of my PhD dissertation.



Humbly,



with regards,



Nagaraj
