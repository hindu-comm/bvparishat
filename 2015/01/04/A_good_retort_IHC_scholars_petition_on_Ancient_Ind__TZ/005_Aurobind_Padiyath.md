We often forget that Sanskrit was the natural language and was existing during a time when print or even handwriting had not developed. In order to pass on the knowledge and information those masters were often compelled to use symbolic or metaphors for easy remembrance. These remained as it is even after the latest methodology of storing informations developed.  
What is pitiable is giving the undue importance to the metaphors and extrapolated existence to the nonexistent facts.  
It is in this regards the vidwans of Sanskrit who should come forward and clarify those absurdities.  
The clear distinction of symbolic expressions, metaphors etc should not be allowed to assume factual position.
