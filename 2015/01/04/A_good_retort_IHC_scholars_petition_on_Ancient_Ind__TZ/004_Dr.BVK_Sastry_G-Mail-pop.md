Namaste Nagaraj Paturi garu



Giving an example to illustrate the point



Science: Bhoo-loka ( assuming that it refers to what is called as Earth in science) is not seated on head of any reptile.



Popular Belief: ‘ Bhoo-loka rests on Adi-Sehsha : A Snake with Thousand heads and hoods ( Of course supported with lot more emphasis from Shastra tradition and Purana resources; and literary expressions of Phnai-PhaNa –Moordhni … ).



IF one mixes these two out of their specific domains, THEN what may be the consequent questions ?

Either Science has to figure out how of a ‘ Thousand head- Hood Snake’ ( - In its current state, science knows only snakes with two heads at best. Read more on : **Polycephaly, **a condition of having [more than one](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernumerary_body_part "Supernumerary body part") head. The term is derived from the Greek [stems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_stem "Word stem") poly- (Greek: "πολύ") meaning 'multiple' and kephali- (Greek: "κεφάλι") meaning "head", and encompasses bicephaly and dicephaly (both referring to two-headedness). A variation is an animal born with two faces on a single head, a condition known as [diprosopus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diprosopus "Diprosopus"). In medical terms these are all [congenital](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder "Congenital disorder") [cephalic disorders](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cephalic_disorder "Cephalic disorder").
There are many occurrences of multi-headed animals, in real life as well as in [mythology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mythology "Mythology"). In [heraldry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heraldry "Heraldry") and [vexillology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vexillology "Vexillology"), the [double-headed eagle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-headed_eagle "Double-headed eagle") is a common symbol, though no such animal is known to have ever existed.

OR

Tradition/ Popular Belief has to help Scientists to understand the biology and space science of Earth moving round Sun in ‘ unsupported space at a given speed’ and still resting on ‘ Adi-Seshas head- hood’.

The ‘ easy way out’ is to twist the meaning of the word ‘Adi-Shesha’ as ‘ Beginning and End’ / Bhoo-loka as ‘Chaturdasha Bhuvana brahmanda ‘ and map it to milky way –stelalr space and talk of Vishnu-Viswa roopa and take recourse to symbolism ; and then …. (you know…).

Similar is the case with Ganesha as elephant head transplant, Test tube baby in Mahabharata, kind of claims….

This is not to decry the great achievements of Science in ancient India; This is a caution on overstretching and making a bad cocktail of Science and Tradition /popular belief, where the real causality is
‘Sanskrit language- Vidwan’ ; the worst part of the scenario, being the total ignorance and oblivious nature in which this ‘specie, called Sanskrit - Language -Vidwan’ lives in the ‘ lost world of Yuga-scale time cycles’.
