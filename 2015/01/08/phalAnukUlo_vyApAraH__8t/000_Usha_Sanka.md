Namaste

This question was asked before inthe same groupand the following responses were given by members in the past. (copy pasted below)

Just wanted to know if there is any information more on this, now? Has there been any thinking done by anyone before, on the same issue?

उदा- गम्-- उत्तरदेश-संयोगानुकूलव्यापारः 

I heard that it started in "dIdhiti" for the first time. Can elders throw more light on this? Anything related is welcome.

Thankyou in advance.

***Que-*** फलानुकूलो व्यापारो धात्वर्थ इतीयं परम्परा कुत आरब्धा? तन्नाम, केन कस्मिन् ग्रन्थे प्रथमं धातोः फलानुकूलो व्यापार इति प्रतिपादितम् इति जिज्ञासे। कृपया समाधानं दीयताम्।

  

***Response-1*** On the basis of the word vyaapaara, it appears to be an explanation based on Mimamsa concept whose system of analysis is like that vis-a-vis Naiyaayikas. Other systems differ. For the further system of analysis with words and concepts: See: Nyayakosa and Mimamsakosa. Regards, spnarang

  

***Response-2*** फलानुकूलो व्यापारो धात्वर्थ इति इदम्प्रथमतया केनोक्तमिति तु महान् शोधस्य विषयः। न्यायभाष्ये एकत्र पचतीत्यस्य विवरणं क्रियते, तत्र तु शब्दशः फलानुकूलो व्यापार इति धात्वर्थ इति नोक्तम्। परन्तु तस्य विवरणं तथापि कर्तुं शक्यम्। मूलग्रन्थाः द्रष्टव्याः।Sachchidanand Mishra [sachchi...@gmail.com]()

  

***Response-3***Notwithstanding the similar resultsthrough grammatical analysis, the locus of the philosophers differ on the issue. Mimamsakas care for the kriyaa or vyaapaara more than the person whereas Naiyaayikas care for the person ( prathamaanta) more than the kriyaa. That is why the words and the epicentre of the analysis differs. Most of the texts have mixed up the issue. spnarang
