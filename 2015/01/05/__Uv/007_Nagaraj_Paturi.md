I heard from Sri Advayananda Bharati Swami (Poorvaas'rama name: Sri Tummalapalli Ramalingeswara Rao garu ) that the criterion and the procedure for the selection of the next Peethadhipati is much more detailed, complex and rigorous and is not limited to just scholarship but observations by the previous peethadhipati about minute aspects of personal behaviour (in the aspects of adherence to S'aastra), spiritual aptitude etc.



The present selection too must have been preceded by such long procedures.



I know the Kuppa brothers (Father and uncles of the chirangeevi Kuppa Venkateswar prasad) from a long time not only asas our family friends but even as the symbols of the anoochaana paramparaa and that is one of the most important aspect of the Shringeri Peethadhipati's outlook.



I am sure Sri Sri Sri Bharathi Teertha Swamigal handed down the peetham into the safest and the best hands.



With namaskaarams to guruparamparaa,



Nagaraj
