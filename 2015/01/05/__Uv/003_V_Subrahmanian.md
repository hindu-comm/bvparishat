Dear Sri Ganesh ji,  
  

While making the announcement at the public function in Sringeri yesterday, HH said: // The successor designate, Sri Venkateswara Prasad gaaru has done kramānta yajur veda adhyayana, has completed the study of the nyāya shāstra. He has been in the Sringeri pāṭhaśāla for the last 5 to 6 years. //  
  

What I have observed from my visits to Sringeri is:  
  

He has also started giving vākyārtha at the annual Ganapati vidwat sadas. During such occasions, when chaturveda seva is done, he often recites the yajur veda and the atharva veda too. I have heard him recite the Mundakopanishat (which is of the atharva veda too) on occasions.   
  

In another forum a member posted these details today:  
  
//One of the brilliant brahmachArIs of sringeri veda pATashAla shri Kuppa Venkateshwara Prasad has been selected as the uttarAdhikAri who is the son of a great vedic & tarka scholar shrI kuppa siva subramanya avadhani garu, who served as veda pATashAla principal in Keesaragutta, near Hyderabad, and is the veda principal of TTD currently.//
