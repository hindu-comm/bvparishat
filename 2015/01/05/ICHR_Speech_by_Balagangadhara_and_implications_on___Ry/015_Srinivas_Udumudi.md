[Karl Löwith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_L%C3%B6with) published his book*Meaning in History: The Theological Implications of the Philosophy of History* (University of Chicago Press, 1949) even before Mircea Eliade. And Friedrich Nietzsche critiqued concept of history as being theological in 19th century itself in his book Untimely Meditations (1874), probably in response to Hegel's Philosophy of History (lectures from 1820s published in 1837).
