14\. Since the theories in philosophy, psychology, cultural anthropology and other such disciplines that did not use the word 'myth' in a pejorative sense, moreover looked at 'myth' with a highly positive attitude as mentioned under #8 abovedid not get a wide currency among non-specialist general academicians, they began to reactnegatively whenever anyone used the word 'myth' in reference to any of the Veda, purANaor itihAsa narratives and whenever somebody tried to defend these narratives as containing 'truth' that is independent of the truth being pursued by science.



15\. If your prativAdi gives you achoice between taking himwith his sthUlas'arIra to svarga/naraka or agreeing withhis vAdathat such lOkas do not exist at all, what would you do? Would you not tell him that such lOkas do exist but not at a plane of reality that can be reached through sthUlas'arIra? Theorists of myth particularly Kant and Kantian philosophers and Jungian psychologists argued that the truth contained in the myth is a different kind of a truth than that is reached at with help of the equipment and methods of science. Can not we sayif not the same at least similar about the truth contained by itihAsa, purANa etc.? 'Factuality of itihAsa is not the same as the factuality attempted to be established by history' is what is being pointed out by scholars such as Prof. Balagangadhara.



16. He was also attacking 'history' itself as a category/concept that has a legacy of Christian theology. At the same time, he was chiding the Sanghparivar historians for falling into the trap oftrying to prove 'historical factuality'ofevents narrated in Mahabharata.

In an interview at the very start of his role of Prof. Sudarshan Rao, the new Chairman of ICHR is reported to have said that proving historical factuality of events described in Mahabharata would be one of his first priorities. Prof. Balagangadhara was responding through his lecture to that. He was simultaneously attacking the Marxist historians that have been dominating ICHR throughout its existence (except for short periods when NDA was ruling ), for unnecessarily privileging history over other ways of looking at the past without realizing that the category of history itself has a shaky foundation.
