Prof Paturi,  
Lately here we are trying to construct something we call an India Discovery Center for the education of a whole  
new population of young people which did not exist twenty years ago.
Their understanding of India needs  

information to connect the present image of India to her past.
Historical research is hard. People who keep  

records embellish in their own glory. I just received the volumes of The History and Culture of Indian People  

published by Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan. I commend this work, but they could need further work and research.  

The civil engineering of the massive temple structures needs be analyzed and put in the map of world  

civilization. They could be places of worship, but they are marvels of human accomplishment. Going further  

back, history would look more interesting. There could be manuscripts buried in people's homes. They  

need be procured, understood and compiled. If we can create a basic framework how Astadhyayi was compiled  

like how many students, how many years, how many stages, we can add a huge milestone to the mechanics of  

knowledge creation. If we succeed, we go further to check where the syllables came from, then further to prosody.  
India has the means and the potential; we have to support talented researchers in understanding the land. This  
discovery would include the epics and the philosophical literature.  

Thank you for bringing up Prof Eliade's material. I didn't see before.  

Best regards,  

BM
