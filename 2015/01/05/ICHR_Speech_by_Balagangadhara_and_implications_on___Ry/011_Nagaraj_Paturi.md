1\. 'History' is obviously a modern word and an English word.Like all words, it carries the culture andworldview of its original users. It is used to refer to a modern academic discipline with all its epistemological and methodological underpinnings. It is logical positivist in its approach in the sense that it does not consider an event tobe apast fact unless its factuality is supported by the evidencessuch as coins, inscriptions, material thatcan be given the date of the event through modern scientific techniques such as carbon dating.



2\. इतिहासः is equally obviously an ancientSanskrit word.Like all words,that toocarries the culture andworldview of its original users. It obviously does not have the epistemological and methodological underpinnings of themodern academic discipline 'history'. i. e., The events called as इतिहासः are taken as past facts irrespective of whether they are supported by the evidencessuch as coins, inscriptions, material thatcan be given the date of the event through modern scientific techniques such as carbon dating or not.



3\. इतिहास is a Hindi word and a modern Hindi word used as a modern Hindi translation for the modern English word 'history'. Thus for any event to be ऐतिहासिक inmodern Hindi it has to be 'historical' as per the methodological requirements of the modern academic discipline 'history'.



4\. The modern Hindi word इतिहासbeingsimilar to the ancient Sanskrit word इतिहासः is one of the reasons for the current problems of confusion between the meanings of the words history and इतिहासः.



5\. Among various narratives described with the help of English words such as fables, folktales, fairy tales, legends, myths etc., legends and myths are the ones that are believed by the people of whose culture and collective memory such narratives are part, to be past facts. Fables, folktales, fairy tales etc. are the ones , though are equally part of the culture and collective memory of the same people, not considered to be facts. Among the two: myths and legends, myths are narrativestreated as sacred by the people of whose culture and collective memory they are part. Legends need not necessarily bethe narrativestreated as sacred. Myths are believed to have taken placein asupernatural space-time. Legends are believed to have taken place on the same earth where we all live and on a plane of reality whereall of us exist here and now. As such, legends are looked at as having some'historical' element in them.
