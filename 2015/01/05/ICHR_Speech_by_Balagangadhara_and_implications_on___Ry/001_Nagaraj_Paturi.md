Thanks for posting this highly relevant debate.



Critiquing the category of 'history' itself instead of critiquing a certain historical position has been happening from quite some time. Prof. balagangadhara was making an Indian version of that by interrogating the category from the standpoint of traditional Indian worldview.



Cudos to the new IHRC Chairman for being so open minded as to invite a critique of his method and project and praising him.
