It appears that Prof. Gangadharan is not fully aware of the Indian historiography. The Puranas have one of the mandates to keep the track of time through the chronological lists of the kings of the different dynasties and Purana also insists that this is necessary for the dharma. The Ramayana and the Mahabharata can be more than histor, but there is no denying that there arehistorical facts in these texts. To go into the detail historicity of the epics, it may be necessary to go into a different thread.
