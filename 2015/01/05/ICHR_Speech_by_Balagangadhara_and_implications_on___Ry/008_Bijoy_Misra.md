Prof Paturi,  
Actually Swami Ranganathananda of The Ramakrishna Mission gave them as a gift to me in Hyderabad in 1992.  

It has been a journey. I have used them by reading sporadically in preparing occasional lectures. Through the  
process I discovered that I must refer to the original material and began my personal studies in Sanskrit. A local  

monk here Swami Sarvagatananda (now deceased) became my ally. He had a library and lent me books on Vedanta  

literature. We wrote books together.  

While talking about history I must acknowledge the volumes called The Story of Civilization by Will and Ariel  

Durrant, who in their first volume did present the historian's view why India must be studied. This volume was published  

in 1935 with copyright with Will Durrant. The first three volumes on The Cultural Heritage of India came in 1937,  
with the birth centenary of Sri Ramakrishna. These volumes give a great qualitative study of India's culture. I learn  
that two more volumes have been added since I had my set of six. The Vidya Bhavan books apparently were planned  
in 1944 and the first volume came in 1951. These are eleven massive volumes are history-oriented with dates people,  
life and society.  
Together these two sets form a solid contribution to learn India and her culture. But we need more analytic studies on  
people and events. Biographical research on the poets, artists, musicians and the like do not exist. The Indian tradition  

of hiding names does not help. Various speculated dates are attempted in the west and they get copied by lay persons  

and in textbooks. We need solid work on language evolution and writing systems. Most of the world culture began in  

India. Hopefully we can create a methodical track than living on mythology or on the closure theories of the west.  

Best regards,  

Bijoy Misra
