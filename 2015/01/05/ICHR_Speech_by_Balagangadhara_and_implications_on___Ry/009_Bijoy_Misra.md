Our India Discovery Center that I mentioned earlier is conceived in a five part structure arranged  

chronologically through history. We are working currently on the second part, 1500 AD to 1900 AD,  

we call Mughal Period. I just finished reading the vol 7 of The History and Culture of the Indian People  

entitled The Mughal Empire. Dr R C Majumdar is the editor. One could get emotional to read  
about the systematic destruction of India's landmarks. One would also delight to hear of the cunning  
maneuvers of the brigades of Shivaji and the valor of the Sikhs. Indian identity has to position itself not  
simply by Gandhi's work but also many nationalists who sacrificed themselves such that India could  
survive.  

Every new youth has a right to know the story of a piece of land the person calls home or for people  
like me, land of my origin. It is a story of scholarship, perseverance and determination. India is  
made by real people and the world ought to know the makers of India. It has no parallel.
