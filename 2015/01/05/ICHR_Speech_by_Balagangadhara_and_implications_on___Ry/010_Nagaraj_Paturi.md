Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



I read the article of Prof Balgangadhara. Will you please explain to me clearly difference between ITIHAASA and HISTORY giving couple of examples. Thank you. N.R.Joshi.

Pranams to Joshiji and all.

IT is known to all that ITIHAASA is popularly used as the Sanskrit Equivalent of the English word HISTORY. So also AITIHAASIKAANI SATYAANI for Historical Facts.

This word is very often seen used in the sense of History in the following contexts:

1. Sva - Saastriya Itihasa

2. samskrta saahitya itihasa 3. Bhaaratiiya Jyotisha Saastra Itihaasa

4. Vyaakarana Saastra Itihasa 5. Bhaaratiiya Sangiita - Nrtya kalaa itihaasa and so on.

The following definitions in Vaacaspatyam also can be seen.

  

1. "vÉ¨ÉÉÇlÉÇEòÉ¨É¨ÉÉäIÉÉhÉÉ¨ÉÖ{Énäù¶ÉºÉ¨ÉÎx´ÉiÉ¨ÉÂ\*

{ÉÚ´ÉÇ´ÉÞkÉEòlÉÉªÉÖHòÊ¨ÉÊiÉ½þÉºÉÆ \|ÉSÉIÉiÉä"\*\*

(2)+xªÉÎº¨ÉxÉÂ {ÉÖ®úÉ´ÉÞkÉä ºÉ SÉ ¦ÉÉ®úiÉä ¶ÉÉÎxiÉ{É´´ÉÉÇnùÉè

¤É½ÖþEò±{ÉÉä nùÌ¶ÉiÉ&\*  

3.´Éänù¦ÉÉMÉÊ´É¶Éä¹ÉºªÉè´ÉäÊiÉ½þÉºÉ°ü{Éi´É¨ÉÖHò¨ÉÂ\* iÉSSÉ {ÉÖ®úÉ´ÉÞkÉ\|ÉÊiÉ{ÉÉnùEòi´ÉÉiÉÂ

So from all these definitions Puraavrittam (What had happened once) is known by the term Hitihaasa or History.

A Synonym of Itihasa is Caritam

Hence we have usages like - Caritam Raghunathasya Satakotipravistaram.

Dr. Bijoy Misraji responded as follows:

As I see इतिहास is a chronicle of the legends, where the evidence is the story itself.  

The western concept of history is not a cultural concept in Indian tradition.  
इतिहास is more of a believing the written word like the Bible. There is a tendency to  
force an assumption than looking for evidence. Various unfortunate assumptions are  
made to justify the belief.  
  

Some of the western scholars fall in this trap easily. By treating इतिहास as history  

they get lost in its interpretation. Various ignorant statements are made in the name  

of dissecting history. Many times इतिहास can be conceptual and metaphorical.  

it is a poetic document styled with imagination and has to be studied as a work  
of art than as a document of facts.  
  

As we can see in रामायण, as has been my interest, there could be a historical  

story line. But all words or events must not be taken as facts. This has been the  

biggest trouble with the document-based belief systems. Any document of faith  

may only convey the values and does not compile a literal play of God on earth.  
God does not come once and takes time to compile a book. Part of the world  
is unfortunately wrapped in this. Indian faith is not based on history, hence we  
must not associate any historical value unless we are utterly scientific about them.  
  

It is quite possible (I am not a scholar of colonial history) that इतिहास was  

translated as "history" for convenience. They are two different words with different  

conceptual meanings. Another word "mythology" is used, which is a different extreme.  
इतिहास should stay as such like पुराण which are conceptual words in Indian tradition.  
  

Rama was a great warrior could be "history." Rama killed "demons" who came  

flying in the sky isइतिहास. Together they are इतिहास, till we sort out the "historical  

facts" in the story.
