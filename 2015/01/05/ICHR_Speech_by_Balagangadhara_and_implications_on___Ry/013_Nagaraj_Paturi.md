10\. Thus what these European scholars did is first, they viewed Mahabharata, Ramayana as 'mythology' equating them with Greco-Roman mythology and then they did the 'looking for history' thing that they did to Greco-Roman mythology to these Indian books too.



11\. Many Indian scholars blindly followed both these steps closely and plunged into big debates of various competing historical interpretations ofa certainstory of Mahabharata, Ramayana or various Puranas.



12\. As if this whole fun was not enough, the then fashionable (now outdated, rejected and hence laughed at) theories of Aryan Dravidian conflict were dragged into this confusion. The British used this wholefun tothe advantage of their 'divide and rule' technique.
