He was not asking historians not to do history.





There were two points made by him:



1\. Mahabharata is Itihasa not history. Attempts to historicise is it are a. not conceptually correct. b. is a blind continuation of the british scholars' attitude towards our material c. has unnecessary political consequences. This was a criticism of the approach of the new ICHR Chairman who invited him.



2\. The entire currentparadigm of 'history' has a theological legacy. This point is what I said is close to the approach of prof. Mircea Eliade, Prof. Levi Strauss and a few others who viewed 'history' as one of many possible ways of looking at the past alongside the other ways such as the mythological way. This is what furiated the commentator Prof. Gurukkal.
