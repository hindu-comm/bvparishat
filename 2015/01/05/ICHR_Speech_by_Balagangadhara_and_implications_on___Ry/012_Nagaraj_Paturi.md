6\. There are a huge number of Sanskrit words apart from इतिहासः, such as like Gaatha, Naaraas'amsi, Vams'a, Akhyana, Aitihyaand PuraaNa etccategorizing narratives. How to understand those terms through various English words is a challenge involving all the difficulties and problems of cross-cultural translation. Understanding इतिहासः in terms of one or the other terms such as myth, legend etc. is part of that challenging and problematic task only.



7\. One point is that narrativesthat can roughly be categorized asmyth and legend have been there in a huge numberthroughout the world in all the ancient civilizations, in all the tribal and rural societies spread throughout the world. once the modern discipline and category of 'history' came into existence as part of modernity, this new category along with all the elements of modernitygot privileged over all other traditional forms of narrative. As a result, throughout the world, peoplestarted to attempt to prove their 'believed to be true' narratives as 'historical'.



8\. Meanwhile, myth became a huge obsession in the west during modern period. People from various disciplines such as philosophy, psychology, cultural anthropology, philology etc.,began to theorize myth. The pejorative use of the word myth as a word for non-real , false nation etc. took back seat in the wake of all these new theories. Some of these theories viewed myth as a kind of a 'degenerated'/'corrupted' history. But most of these theories posited myth as containing a different 'truth' than the one attempted to be captured by 'science' (of which 'history' is a part).



9\. But attempts to trace 'historical' facts from Greco-Roman myths became a fashionable academic activity among general educated Europeans. It is such Europeans who after encountering Sanskrit books such as Mahabharata applied that approach to these Sanskrit books too.
