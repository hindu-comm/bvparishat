Friends,  

I thought Prof Balagangadhar started with a good review and then he went tangent.  

To advise that historical research is unnecessary to a History Society meeting might  
need courage, but the statement has no value. People have a right to know who Valmiki,  

was or who the authors of Mahabharata were. They must be able to distinguish between  

events and imagination. Fundamental research on the origin of the ideas is necessary.  

Even the story of Ramayana has a life and that life must be examined.
Finding the right  

tools to deduce the past from the available resources is the drive of science including  

speculations on the origin of earth or the origin of life. I agree that it would need more  

talents and resources than political will, but must not be rejected. We exist because  
our ancestors existed. We have a right to ask who they were and what did they do.  

Scholarship is not acceptance, it is questioning and seeking answers.  

Happy New Year,  

Bijoy Misra, Boston.
