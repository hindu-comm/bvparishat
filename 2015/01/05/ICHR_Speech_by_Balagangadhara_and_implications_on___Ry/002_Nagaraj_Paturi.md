The argument of Prof. Balagangadhara is very close to that of a very old one by Prof.Mircea Eliade in his books such as Sacred and Profane.



For example, the following is from his Sacred and Profane:



One important innovation in the experience and repetition of time is the linear concept of history as presented by Judaism. "Compared with the archaic and palaeo-oriental religions, as well as with the mythic-philosophical conceptions of the eternal return, as they were elaborated in India and Greece, Judaism presents an innovation of the first importance. For Judaism, time has a beginning and will have an end. The idea of cyclic time is left behind. Yahweh no longer manifests himself in cosmic time (like the gods of other religions) but in a historical time, which is irreversible (p 110)." Christianity further valorizes historical time by the incarnation which takes place "in the fullness of time" and thus becomes the pivotal juncture in history and the Christian sacred calendar. "Hegel takes over the Judaeo-Christian ideology and applies it to universal history in its totality: the universal spirit continually manifests itself in historical events and manifests itself only in historical events. Thus the whole of history becomes a theophany; every thing that has happened in history had to happen as it did, because the universal spirit so willed it. The road is thus opened to the various forms of twentieth-century historicistic philosophies (p 112)."
