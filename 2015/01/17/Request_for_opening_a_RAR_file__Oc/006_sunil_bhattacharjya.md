any Thank you Shankaraji for the valuable information, but unfortunately my computer tries to block any information from that site, as after getting 8 KB of material, it stopped getting further from the site. I don't know whether there is probem in my computer or there is problem at the DLi end. Have you experienced such thing and if so what would be your suggestion? I am interested in the paper, which is there in that journal. All the scans of the paper, which I have are not properly scanned.  
  

Regards,
