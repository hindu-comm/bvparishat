Dear friends,  
  

Someone has sent me a paper entitled "**Two Aryabhatas of al-Biruni" \[Bull. Calcutta Math. Soc. 17 (1926), 59-74.\]** by Late Dr. Bibhutibhusan Datta (later Swami Vidyaranya). The paper is in RAR and I am unable to open it. Can any member help me in opening and converting it to pdf ?  
  

Regards,
