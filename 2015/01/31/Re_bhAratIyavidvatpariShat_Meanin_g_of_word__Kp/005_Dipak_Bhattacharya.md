It seems that the technicalities are proving obstacles to the emergence of a clear picture to Dr. Joshi. Parisankhyaa is a kind of rule, not necessarily legal rule but rule occurring in philosophical/scientific/juridical treatises. Both niyama and parisankhyaa modify general rules but may they do in different ways. The usual notion is that one states the exceptions and the other shows the positive cases. But with Pata;njali there was no parisankhyaa. Later too its independence was questioned. I request Dr Joshi to see the commentaries of Uva.ta and Naage;sa on Pata;njali's words pa;ca pa;ncanakhaa bhak.syaa.h in the Paspa;saahnika. The French translation too may help. The majority view will be clear along with other ones.
