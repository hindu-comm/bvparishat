Dear Dr. Joshi,  
  
The word parisaMkhyA has a technical meaning in mImAMsA. It is a kind of vidhi, but it is expressed in a negative way, and therefore appears as if it is a pratishedha. It presumes the existence of an a priori inunction, or what is called an apUrva vidhi. Given an action that has already been enjoined, a niyama vidhi restricts the way(s) in which it may be done, whereas a parisaMkhyA vidhi enumerates the way(s) in which it should \*not\* be done. For example, given an injunction that the rice must be dehusked, the parisaMkhyA vidhi adds, na nakhena, not using one's nails.  
  
Hope this helps. The word is used in this specific technical sense in the advaita vedAnta texts too, especially by SankarAcArya and sureSvarAcArya. This should not be confused with the word prasaMkhyAna, which occurs in the yogasUtra and is used by kAlidAsa also, in the sense of dhyAna/samadhi.  
  
Best regards,  
Vidyasankar
