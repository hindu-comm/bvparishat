Thank you Prof Deshpande. I appreciate your help.



I tempted to ask another question. I have seen meaning of the word 'Parisankhyaa' in Apte's disctionary. Something like 'opposed to Vidhi, Niyama etc' .

Is there use of this word in laukika parlance,? Perhaps an example in everyday life for use of this word will help me to rememberits meaning. Thanks N.R.Joshi.

Dear Dr. Joshi,



  The word abhidhātṛbhiḥ is the instrumental plural of the agentive word abhidhātṛ- derived from abhi-dadhāti "to speak, to express." So it could translate as "by the speakers".
