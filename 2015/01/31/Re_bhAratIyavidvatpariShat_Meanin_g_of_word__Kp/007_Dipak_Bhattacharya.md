\<I have seen meaning of the word 'Parisankhyaa' in Apte's disctionary. Something like 'opposed to Vidhi, Niyama etc' .Is there use of this word in laukika parlance,? Perhaps an example in everyday life for use of this word will help me to rememberits meaning Vidvan N R Joshi\>  

The word does not occur in common parlance because it is a highly technical term mostly used in the ritualist commentarial literature. The best exposition occurs in K.C.Chatterji, Pata;njali's Mahaabhaa.sya Paspasaahnika, 1948; new edn. Jadavpur Univ., 2010 (?): under pa;nca pa;ncanakhaa bhak.syaa.h. It is as far as possible lucid.
