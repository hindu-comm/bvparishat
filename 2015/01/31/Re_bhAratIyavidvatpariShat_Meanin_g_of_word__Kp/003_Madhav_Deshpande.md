The following URL has some brief discussion of the distinction between vidhi, niyama, and parisaṃkhyā as understood in the Mīmāṃsā tradition:

The classical example of parisaṃkhyā is pañca pañcanakhāḥ bhakṣyāḥ: Lit: "five creatures with five claws each are edible." The Mīmāṃsā tradition does not interpret this as a prescription to eat these five animals. It argues that eating these and other animals happens to be obtained by natural instincts (rāgataḥ). Under this natural background (tatra cānyatra ca), the statement is interpreted as saying that other animals, excluding these five five clawed animals, must not be eaten. So the literal meaning is abandoned, and an implied meaning, taking into account a wider context, is adopted.

  

The example vrīhīn avahanti, "one pounds the rice-grains", is interpreted as a niyama (niyamaḥ pākṣike sati), where one can either pound the rice-grains or remove the husk with one's nails. With such alternatives available, one is asked to pick a particular alternative (avaghāta).
