As I see इतिहास is a chronicle of the legends, where the evidence is the story itself.  

The western concept of history is not a cultural concept in Indian tradition.  
इतिहास is more of a believing the written word like the Bible. There is a tendency to  
force an assumption than looking for evidence. Various unfortunate assumptions are  
made to justify the belief.  
  

Some of the western scholars fall in this trap easily. By treating इतिहास as history  

they get lost in its interpretation. Various ignorant statements are made in the name  

of dissecting history. Many times इतिहास can be conceptual and metaphorical.  

it is a poetic document styled with imagination and has to be studied as a work  
of art than as a document of facts.  
  

As we can see in रामायण, as has been my interest, there could be a historical  

story line. But all words or events must not be taken as facts. This has been the  

biggest trouble with the document-based belief systems. Any document of faith  

may only convey the values and does not compile a literal play of God on earth.  
God does not come once and takes time to compile a book. Part of the world  
is unfortunately wrapped in this. Indian faith is not based on history, hence we  
must not associate any historical value unless we are utterly scientific about them.  
  

It is quite possible (I am not a scholar of colonial history) that इतिहास was  

translated as "history" for convenience. They are two different words with different  

conceptual meanings. Another word "mythology" is used, which is a different extreme.  
इतिहास should stay as such like पुराण which are conceptual words in Indian tradition.  
  

Rama was a great warrior could be "history." Rama killed "demons" who came  

flying in the sky isइतिहास. Together they are इतिहास, till we sort out the "historical  

facts" in the story.
