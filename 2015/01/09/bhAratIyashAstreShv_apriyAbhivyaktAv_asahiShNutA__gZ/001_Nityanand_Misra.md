Better to read commentaries in Sanskrit:

I have to disagree with Vedabase's translation and purport - the portions in red below are extrapolations in my view, they do not follow from either the verse or traditional commentaries (including the commentaries by Jīva Gosvāmī and Viśvanātha Cakravartī). In addition, the commentaries talk about Adhikāra of administering Daṇḍa which is posessed by a reigning king (not any Kṣatriya).  

  

Vedabase's Translation  

Quote

*If one hears an irresponsible person blaspheme the master and controller of religion, one should block his ears and go away if unable to punish him. But if one is ableto kill, then one should by force cut out the blasphemer's tongueand kill the offender, and after that one should give up his own life.*

Vedabase's Purport

Quote

*... therefore a kṣatriya should at once cut out the tongue of the vilifier and kill him.*

Scholars of Bhāgavatam may comment better.
