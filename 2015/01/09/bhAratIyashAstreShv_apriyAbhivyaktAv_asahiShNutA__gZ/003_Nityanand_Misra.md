More mistakes in Vedabase translation  
  
[dharma](http://vedabase.net/d/dharma)-[avitari](http://vedabase.net/a/avitari) — the controller of religion;  
  
This is not accurate. धर्मावितृ means the "protecter of Dharma/righteousness". Most commentaries translate धर्मावितरि as धर्मरक्षके. The word अवितृ is from root अव रक्षणगतिकान्तिप्रीतितृप्त्यवगमप्रवेशश्रवणस्वाम्यर्थयाचनक्रियेच्छादीप्त्यवाप्त्यालिङ्गनहिंसादानभागवृद्धिषु. रक्षण = protection is one of the meanings, but not यमन = control.  
  
[asatīm](http://vedabase.net/a/asatim) — of the blasphemer;  
  
This is wrong. असतीम् is feminine accusative singular. It cannot mean "of the blasphemer". There is a variant reading in some commentaries which has असताम्. असताम् can be translated as "of the evil-doers" (in plural) as it is masculine/neuter genitive plural.  
  
As pointed before, the meaning of "killing the offender" is an extrapolation, misleading and probably dangerous too.  
  
The point is: Vedabase translations can be inaccurate and misleading, as in this example. Caveat lector.
