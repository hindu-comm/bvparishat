Thank you ,

  
"This script is unknown to modern scholars."?

This was Typographical error and I know some scholars who know this script.

Can you share me Vedic notation Nandinagari , Does it follow Devanagari or hasindependent Vedic accents.

I have seenNandinagari is written by Dr. P.Visalakshy in this Doc  

[www.unicode.org/L2/L2013/13002-](http://www.unicode.org/L2/L2013/13002-)**nandinagari**.pdf

[](https://www.google.co.in/search?q=nandinaagari&oq=nan&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i57j0l4.1417j1j4&sourceid=chrome&es_sm=122&ie=UTF-8#)

In section2.11 it mentions some accent markers. Can you give attestations from manuscripts having Vedic signs.

Does it have distinct signऌ andॡ and dependent signs as inपॢ .Does this script has signs for Chandrabindu, Pluta, avagaraha and Vedic anusvaras.Which website can I get digitised manuscripts.
