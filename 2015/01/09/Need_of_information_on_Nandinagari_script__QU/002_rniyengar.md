"This script is unknown to modern scholars."?  

  

This statement is not correct. Dr.Jagannatha of Mysore (BVP Member) is a specialist in several ancient scripts, including NN. some time back I was interested in deciphering a few pages of "pUrvapArASaryam" in NN script, (unknown to me to be so in the beginning) to verify whether it is same as the "vrddhapArASaryam" available in devanagari script. Dr.Jagannatha provided the answer: It was identical.

  

Further, I am sharing Dr.Jagannatha's explanation about the acript:

  

"....the work is in Nandinaagari. This Nandinaagari became popular in Karnataka during Vijayanagara empire. In most of the cases,Nandinagariwas used for writing Samskrta. But rarely one can find even Kannada works written in this script.The users of this script
employed Kannada numeral marks. In some Nandinaagari mss., Anusvaara is placed after the letters and it is of only peculiar style. I have noticed this in several ms. of Nandinaagari.

  

Scholars are not sure why it is called Nandinaagari. My guess is this: Virupaaksha of Hampi was aaraadhya-devataa of Kings of Vijayanagara empire. In and around the temple of Virupaaksha so manyNandistatues are situated.Nandiof three faces, Largernandi- these are very famous. So the wordnandisymbolizes the Vijayanagara empire in which the capital city had so many Nandis, and, as I already said, Vijayanagara Kings are behind the popularity of this script. Since it is in Karnataka it is not a wonder that the numeral signs are of Kannada. "
