Nandinagari script is Brahmic script derived from Nagari script used to write Sanskrit in Southern India in the regions of Karnataka, southern Maharashtra and parts of Andhra Pradesh. This script is unknown to modern scholars. Manuscripts, inscriptions and copper plates have been found in this script.I'm researching on Indian scripts & languages.  
  
Is there scholar who can provide complete information regarding its origin, usage, development, manuscript libraries, present condition.  
  
If possible can someone send its standard vowels, consonants, conjuncts, variants, standardised book for reference. I need the Data on native user and scholar community. Please you send digitised images of manuscripts.
