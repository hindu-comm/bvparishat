1\. nandinAgari is one of the well researched topics. Just googling for the word would yield a huge number of pages. Most of the information you sought including vowel-symbols etc are all available in those pages.



2\. It figured in many BVP threads.



for example,



<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/bvparishat/nandinagari%7Csort:relevance/bvparishat/dUfB1Ygvle8/zcZK4S1V8N4J>



Please search for the word in BVP.



3\. That is an ancient script. How can there be a surviving native user for it?



4\. sample digitized images of manuscripts are also easily available on the net.



Once you share your efforts in this direction, list members can help you in taking your understanding further ahead.



Best wishes,



Nagaraj
