"This script is unknown to modern scholars."?  

  

*This statement is not correct.*

  

Yes, not correct. Thousands of scholars know Nandinagari, particularly
Maadhva scholars . Dviata works (in mss.)are available either in Nandinagari or Tigalari.

Now, regarding the name. Some three months ago, Sri S.Kartik, a Kannada Research Scholar proposed a fresh theory while I was conversing with him. In some of Nandinagari copper plates (of 12 th century) one can see Nandi figure in Royal seals. Somehow this might have contributed in adding the word Nandi to Nagari.

  

Anusvaara is placed after the letters and it is of only peculiar style. I have noticed this in several ms. of Nandinaagari.  

  

An addition: Writing Anusvara after letter is common in many scripts and Nandinagari is not exception.   

  

Now a days, Nandinagari is being taught to the participants in many workshops conducted by NMM.

  

A good book on Nandinagari is written by Dr. P.Visalakshy(2003)
