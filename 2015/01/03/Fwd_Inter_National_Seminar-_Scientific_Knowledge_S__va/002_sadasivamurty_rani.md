Pranams to all.

This mail is in support of the mail uploaded by Dr. Viswaja S regarding the International seminar.

Though the due date for submitting the abstracts is 5th Jan. 2015 as per the printed brochure the organizers told me when I contacted **to in form all those BVP members who are interested to participate in the said International seminar to note that they can avail the opportunity of sending their abstracts on or before 10 Jan 2015 and can participate in the seminar by remitting the specified registration fee there in**.

I wish that the enthusiastic members will avail this opportunity.

Warm regards,

**Dr. Rani Sadasiva Murty**
