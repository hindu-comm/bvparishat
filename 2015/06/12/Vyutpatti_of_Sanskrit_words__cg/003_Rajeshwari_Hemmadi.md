Thanks for that prompt guidance. really grateful  
  

I will certainly go thru the links.  

  

I have been referring to vachapsatyam, shabda-kalp-druma... I find it hard to understand as till now i have been referring to english dictionaries..  
  

well in these Sansksrit dictionaries, entries have words like highlighted below, which I am unable to understand..  
(1) pratyay names etc. grammar terms & also  
  
(2) the abbreviations of the reference book name  
  

**\_"uS"p**, ®r, E"O"s\[\\\\"\|ðp{O"\\"wf"p\`êSX"pO"%Nppz O"wO"rY"p X"pO"p $ ò{O" \`uX"E"Sç# : òS"uS" T"øW"sNpp \_"\` \\"f"êO"u Y"p $
(Y"Ÿp, {\_"S"pu{O" ðpe"s{X"{O" $ {^"I"o V"SR"S"u ‘‘@%¡\\"wG"%^"r{O" $’’ íNpp. 3$10$ ò{O" S"# $ \_" E" {S"O"o $ J>pT"o$) E"O"sZŒV"X"o $ U¡pvG" ò{O" T"pZ_Y"W"p^"p $ ......

please guide me how to know these terms etc. any books to guide?  
  

Even with my absolute elementary & little bit of knowledge of Sanskrit , I am finding these Sanskrit dictionaries are absolute treasure chest but I dont have the key.. As i am trying to take my babysteps towards it, Please guide.  
  

with sincere regards
