Hari Om Blessed Self!

  

Pujya Gurudev Swami Chinmayananda touched, inspired and transformed devotees across the globe. His mere presence was enough for the thousands devotees who still feel His presence in their lives; who still remember each word He spoke with them; who still follow the path He laid for them!

  

We at CIF, attempt to relive His glory through the stories of the devotees. At [www.chinfo.org/cbcc](http://www.chinfo.org/cbcc) we will be uploading one story daily, for a year. Do read, get inspired and share the same with your family and friends.
