Namaste.

  

Below is a longish mail aboutthe largest Buddhist settlement in the world, created by a Buddhist monk in China in 1980 - very recently, that is. I am forwarding this, firstly, just to share the beauty of it,but more importantly, to gauge how many people agree with my ideas below, and of course, whether anyone can take it up.

  

My idea is as follows - Should we not have a monastery something like this for Hinduism as well, where the different schools of the Vedas can come together and a student can chose whatever they want to learn?We have so much knowledge in our Sanskrit texts being taught in a scattered fashion here and there. Not sure how many Indian students in the Sanskrit universities today are there for interest or just to collect a degree and a livelihood. The monastery should have brahmacharis and brahmacharinis who can pursue knowledge and the search for truth without being hindered by material gains - name, fame, money, spread of Sanskrit, Indian culture, etc. A think a number of organizations already do that. People can visit if they like, but it should be secluded and meant for real seekers. It should be in beautiful pristine natural surroundings, where God seems close at hand!

  

And it would be really nice to have a safe monastery where even women can feel safe as nuns and study by themselves, or with others - as they wish...

  

Uttara.

The largest Buddhist settlement in the world: Inside the village where 40,000 monks and nuns are segregated and televisions are banned... but iPhones are allowed

· **TheLarung Gar Buddhist Academy in China has basic amenities for the 40,000 monks and nuns who stay there**

· **The secluded location is 370 miles from Chengdu and has grown dramatically since its creation**

· **TVs are banned, and the huts of monks and nuns aresegregatedby a winding road through the middle**



Among the green rolling hills in the Larung Gar Valley in China, the last thing you would expect to see in the countryside are thousands of red wooden huts that have been built in a massive cluster.

Despite its secluded location it is home to the Larung Gar Buddhist Academy,the world's largest Buddhist settlement.

A vibrant splash of red, this colourful settlement has sprung up in the 1980s and is now a haven for over 40,000 monks and nuns.

The sprawling settlement, Sertar, sits on elevations of 12,500ft, and the religious devotees battle harsh climates to study at the remote dwelling.

The wooden huts are built so closely together, they look like a red sea spreading up the hilly terrain.

Nuns and monks are housed near to their colleges, and separated by age and sex.

The segregation of male and female living quarters is marked by a winding road, which weaves through the dense mass of huts.

### **THE ACT OF SKY BURIALS EXPLAINED**

Sky burials are common in the province of Tibet and involve corpses being cut and left for animals to devour.

The human bodies are placed on mountaintops in order for the elements or predatory animals, typically vultures, to prey upon it.

The majority of Tibetans and many Mongolians adhere to Vajrayana Buddhism, which teaches the transmigration of spirits.

They believe after death the body is an empty vessel and there is no need to preserve it.

By allowing nature or animals to take command of the body, they are disposing of the remains in the most generous way.

In many areas of Tibet and Qinghai, the ground is too hard and rocky to dig a grave, and, due to the scarcity of fuel and timber, sky burials were typically more practical.

Conditions are basic, with residents having to share communal toilets, and each unheated hut ranging from one to three rooms in size.

An isolated religious haven, Sertar is located around 370 miles from Chengdu, and those wishing to visit have to travel by coach for a gruelling 20 hours.

TVs are prohibited at the picturesque retreat, with monks and nuns flocking to benefit from the studies, prayers and lectures ran at the academy.

PhotographerWanson Lukjourneyed to the secluded location from Chengdu on a 20-hour bumpy coach ride.

The 34-year-old Buddhist said the Larung Area has two small guest houses, but as these were occupied, he had to stay near the entrance.

He stayed two days at the Buddhist centre, taking part in ceremonies.

Luk said that the settlement welcomes everyone, and they maintain their life in the hills from donations and by small businesses like the guest house or small grocery store.

'I was most surprised about how people feel about death,' Luk said.

'I took part in the sky burial ceremony where there were hundreds or thousands of condors waiting quietly.There were 7 corpses on that day...one of them was a child.

'During the ceremony a monk will pray then the "sky burial master" will start cutting the corpses.When he is done, the condors will all fly to the corpses

'They believe the more the condors eat, the better it is and they will not eat bad people's body.'

One encounter which struck a chord for Luk was the meeting of a nun who was on her 'no speech day'.

When the photographer was asking how to get to the top of the hill for night shots she resorted to all forms of gestures to try to assist.

She ended up taking him around the whole monastery, showing him how to spin the prayer wheels and teaching him how to pray.

Although TVs are prohibited in the monastery, iPhones strangely are permitted, with her typing words to instruct him as they went.

Many of the Buddhists own second-hand iPhone 4s.

The incredible academy was established in 1980 in the uninhabited valley by Jigme Phuntsok, an influential lama of the Nyingma tradition.

Despite its remote situation, Larung Gar evolved from a handful of disciples to be the largest Buddhist settlement in the world.

It attracts a mix of students from ethnic Chinese students to pupils from Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Malaysia, who attend separate classes taught in Mandarin, while larger classes are taught in Tibetan.
