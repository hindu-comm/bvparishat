Dear friends,  

Good morning.  

Our paper on the evolution of language for the World Sanskrit Conf is  

now ready. It is an effort to trace the origin of human language using  

the ideas of Indian linguistics mapped on to the modern findings of  

neuroscience. You can write if you would be interested in reviewing.  

Best regards,  

Bijoy Misra
