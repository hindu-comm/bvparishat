Friends,

  

Looking at Rg.1.95.2;

दशेमंतवष्टुर्जनयन्तगर्भमतन्द्रासोयुवतयोविभ्रृत्रम्\|तिग्मानीकंसवयशसंजनेषुविरोचमानंपरिषींनयन्ति\|\|२\|\|

*2. The vigliant and youthful Ten beget, through the wind, this embryo Agni, inherent (in all beings), sharp-visaged, universally renowned, shining among men; him they conduct (to every dwelling)*

*  
*

This isn't my translation, the translation is done my HH. WIlson.. However, I'd like to know peoples opinion on the "*youthful Ten*", that is, if anyone would be kind enough to share.

  

Respectfully,

Kristan.

Here is the rest of the reference;

  

Rgveda samhita; mandala 1; sukta 95. 1-5;

  

द्वे विरुपे वरतः स्वर्थे अन्यान्या वत्समुप धापयेते ।

हरिरन्य्स्यां भवति स्वधावाच्छुक्रो अन्य्स्यां ददृशे सुवर्चाः ॥१॥

*1. Two periods of different complexions, revolve for their own purposes, and each in succession severally nourishes a son; in one, Hari is the receiver of oblations, in the other the Brilliant Agni is beheld.*

*2. The vigliant and youthful Ten beget, through the wind, this embryo Agni, inherent (in all beings), sharp-visaged, universally renowned, shining among men; him they conduct (to every dwelling)*

*3. They contemplate three places of his birth; one in the Ocean, one in the Heaven, one in the Firmament; and dividing the seasons of the year for the benefit of earthly creatures, he formed in regular succession, the eastern quarter.*

*4. Which of you discerns the hidden Agni? A son, he begets his mothers by oblations; the germ of many (waters), he issues from the ocean, mighty and wise, the recipient of oblations.*

*5. Appearing amongst them (the waters), the bright-shining (Agni) increases, rising above the flanks of the waving waters, spreading his own renown: both (heaven and earth) are alarmed, as the radiant Agni is born, and approaching the lion they pay him honour.*
