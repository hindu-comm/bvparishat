  I have read “स्रग्धरा भागवतम्” written by Late Sri. R. rangaswamy Shastri of Angarai and published in the year 1938. In his forward he mentions about a work called “आर्या भागवतम् “.

I had tried in the internet about this आर्या भागवतम्. I am unable to trace or find out about the author and contents.

I request the members to help me if they know about this work
