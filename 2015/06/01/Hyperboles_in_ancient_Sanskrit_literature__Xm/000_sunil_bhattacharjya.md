Dear friends,  
  

In texts like Ramayana we find many abnormal exaggerations, such as Lord Ram, though had a human birth (otherwise he could not have killed Ravana), ruled for 11,000 varshas. Those of us, who know that the word "varsha" could have been used to mean "day", have no problem in understanding these statements, but there will be many sceptics, who will be thoroughly puzzled. Has anybody studied since when such exaggerations stopped appearing in the Sanskrit literature? Was there any Paninian dispproval for use of such exaggerations?  
  

Regards,
