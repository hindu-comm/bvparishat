Dera Dr. Misra.  
  
Yes, Lord Ram must have ruled / lived for 11,000 days only. Monier Williams gives one meaning of "Varsha" as "day". Some pauranic and ancient texts also appear to use the word" varsha" as "day".  
  
In the Mahabharata we see such applications. Bhima tells Yudhisthira that he (Yudhisthira) would have to spend only 13 months in the forest and not 13 years. That is because ! month of Yudhishthira is equal to one year of ordinary person. Of course, all the Pandava brothers along with Draupadi, would have had the benefit, had Yudhisthira accepted that suggestion.  
  

It appears to me that liberty with such exaggerated language probably came to an end at the beginning of the classical period of Sanskrit literature. It could be that some scholar might have already studied this and that has not been publicised. .
