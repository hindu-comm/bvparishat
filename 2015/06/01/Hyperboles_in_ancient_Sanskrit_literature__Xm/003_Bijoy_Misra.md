Dear Dr Bhattacharya,  

This becomes relevant only if someone tries to reconstruct history using  

Ramayana as a text. I don't think that is an appropriate scholarly research.  

To accept it as a literary marvel and interpret as a poetic narrative is a route  

I would follow. The geography can be reconstructed, but the sketch of the  

story must have been a hearsay to the poet. The poet's genius is to add  
narrative and melody, and to create a piece of creative literature par excellence  
(my view!). I don't know where MW gets its equivalence on what logic.  

I agree that In Sanskrit the word is a concept than a frozen symbol.  

Best regards,  
BM
