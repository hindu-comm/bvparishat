Alas! it is a very sad news to say the least and is a great loss to Sanskrit and Telugu as well. I had the good fortune of knowing him personally and getting many of his illustrious publications as great gift form his own hands. More over, I deeply remember several affectionate interactions with him. His phenomenal contribution of translating more than several dozens of original works belong to the lore of Shaastra and Kaavya from Sanskrit to Telugu along with a score of original creative and research works in Sanskrit, Telugu and English coupled with a deep sense of commitment for the propagation of the divine tongue is a great saga by it self. What makes him strikingly noble is his unalloyed commitment for the core features sanaatanadharma that found their expression in Sanskrit and other regional languages of India. He never spared his pen to defend them at any cost. In him we see a true Indian Scholar who could inspire the learned and the lay alike. Above all, just as a tireless worker of Sanskrit in various capacities stands a testimony of wonder and respect.  
  
  

पुल्लेलाभिजनः श्रीमान् रामचन्द्रो महामतिः।  

शताधिकमहाग्रन्थप्रणेता भूतयेsस्तु नः॥  
  
  

I still remember the benedictory verse that was offered to him by me in one of my avadhaanaM-s at Hyderabad which was graciously presided by himself:  
  

त्रेतायुगे सेतुवरं विाधाय श्रीरामचन्द्रश्शिखरैरनेकैः।  

कलौ युगेsस्मिन् किल संस्कृतान्ध्र्योश्शताधिकाभिः कृतिभिर्व्यतानीत्॥  
  

May this worthy son of bhaarati find saayujyam in his personal God Sri Raama.
