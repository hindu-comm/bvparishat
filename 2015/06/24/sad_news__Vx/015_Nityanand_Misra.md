Sad news. Here is coverage in [The Hindu](http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/scholar-pullela-sriramachandrudu-passes-away/article7352337.ece)and [Rajasthan Patrika](http://rajasthanpatrika.patrika.com/story/india/famous-writer-pullela-sri-rama-chandrudu-dies-at-87-1190314.html). Wikipedia has an [article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pullella_Srirama_Chandrudu) on him but minimal details. Request list members familiar with him and his works to expand it.

  

Does anybody know his Guru Parampara, especially who he studied Sanskrit under when he was at Varanasi? Also any resource which lists all of his works? This [Osmania University page](http://www.osmania.ac.in/sanskritacademy/Faculty/Prof.P.Sriramachandrudu.html) lists 19 works from 1980 to 1990.

  

Surprisingly, the *[Inventory of Sanskrit Scholars](http://www.sanskrit.nic.in/digitalbook/i/inventory%20of%20sanskrit%20scholars.pdf)*(2012)lists him at two places, and yet mentions the number of books as only 4 (!!) and 5 (!).
