Namaste Phani Ji,  
  
I was present during the inaugural ceremony of the natya shastra. The first copy was dedicated to Sri Nataraja Swami and later several free copies were given to several dancers who were invited that day as special guests. One of the female dancers was Ms.Swathi Somnath. She was explaining as how Dr.Pullela garu taught her several intricacies of "mudras" that needs to be displayed during the performance.  
  
I was amazed at his knowledge. A scholar of advaita siddhAnta and vyAkaraNa, how could he master the intricacies of nATya shAstra !!  
  
Really amazing; a walking encyclopedia indeed !! He was a rAma bhakta and used to worship rAma panchAyatana daily.  
  
May he attain the oneness with his iSTa dEvata bhagavAn srIrAmachandra .  
  
regs,
