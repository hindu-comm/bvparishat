namaste,

there is never ending to this master's praise, and never ending to wide range of hisknowledge, i had the opportunity to study many of works you mentioned here, particularly his eminent raamaayaNa baalanandinii vyakhyaaH, (when i read his books, he appears before me as teacher teaching me samskRutam, => so much helpful are his writings) his writings included wide range from darshanashaastra, vyaakaraNa, alankaara, puraaNa etc. etc. i also want to ***add***

his wide range of writings and expertise extends to eminent telugu translation books like "sarvadarshanasangrahaH", "kauTilya arthashaastram", "yaajnyavalkyasmRuti" that i had also studied.

reminds me of bhagavan's words in giitaa, "नान्तोस्ति मम दिव्यानां विभूतीनां च परन्तप...एष तूद्देशतः प्रोक्तः विभूतेः विस्तरो मया \|\|
