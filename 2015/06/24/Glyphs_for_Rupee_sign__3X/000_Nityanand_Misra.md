Dear list members  
  

I need to decide which font to use for the Indian Rupee sign in an English book.  
  

Two images are attached:  

  

1\) The original (and official?) design by D Udaya Kumar which was accepted by the Government of India. This is from slide 17 of [this presentation](http://www.idc.iitb.ac.in/events/Indian_Rupee_Symbol.pdf)  
  

2\) The symbol typeset in three free fonts (along with the text Rs 40 in Charis SIL)  

  
A) Linux Libertine: (glyph is ₨ or U+20A8) Very artistic design, and the closest to Devanagari र of the three, but the second horizontal line is too low compared to the original design  
  

B\) Rupee Foradian: (glyph is \` or U+0060) Seems to be exactly as per the official design, but not as artistic since the slanting line has uniform thickness  

  

C\) Charis SIL: (glyph is ₹ or U+20B9) Artistic design, but the second horizontal line is too high compared to the original design. It matches with the R glyph of Charis SIL though (the main font for the book).  
  

Any inputs would be helpful. If there are any other free fonts with better designs, I would be happy to know.
