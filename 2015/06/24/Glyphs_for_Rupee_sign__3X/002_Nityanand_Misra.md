No 'objection' to the original design, just that the uniform thickness of the slanting line makes the design more mechanical than the varying-thickness reed-pen style glyphs we are used to in popular Devanagari typefaces like Chanakya.

  

I am exploring all available typesetting options. Many currency signs have different glyphs in different typefaces. For example, see theofficial Euro sign design and the various glyphs for the same:

There is one font with 26 glyphs available for the Rupee sign
