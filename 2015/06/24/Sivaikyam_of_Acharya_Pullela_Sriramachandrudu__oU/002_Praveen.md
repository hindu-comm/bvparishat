Its a great loss to Sanskrit and Telugu languages. I still remember his lectures on many dias in Hyderabad. My memorable program of acharya gAru was Samskrutha Bhashaa prachaara Samiti's 25 years celebrations. Samiti was honored mahodaya in that celebrations. Whenever Samskrutha mulam is not understood immediately will be referring to his commentary bcz I still remember a paribhasha: vyaakyaanatho vishesha prathipatirnahisandehaad alakshanam. Sometimes it becomes very difficult to understand the muula paaTa then will immediately refer like mahodaya's commentry.

We remember you always in those commentries.

May his soul rest in peace.  
My heart felt condolences to his family members.
