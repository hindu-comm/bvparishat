Dear scholars,

 I was upset hearing the sad news about MM Padmasri Ramachandrudu ji. It is a great loss to the Sanskrit world. He was really “ACHARYA” for all of us who inspired the Sanskrit world with his pleasant character and with his literary activity. He was the inspiration to many Sanskrit scholars. It is impossible to have such a great personality in near future. I prey Lord Sri Venkatesvara to bestow
Moksha to the great soul and to give strength to his family to sustain the great grief..
