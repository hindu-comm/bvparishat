Namaste

  

Respected Shri Ramachandrudu sir has written Telugu translations and commentaries of many popular and important Samskrt sAhitya and advaita vedanta works. His books are a real treasure for all Telugu students and studying Samskrt.

We studied all our MA with the help of his books. Sir is known not only for his commentary works, but also his prefaces. His preface in Telugu on Dhvnayaloka commentary had helped me understand a lot about what is Kavya and dhvani, when I had not much knowledge of studying Samskrt directly. Idiomatic simple language stories of his are collected in a small volume, and I cherished reading that many a time. He is also known for his subtle humourous verses, imitations on popular shlokas.

There is also felicitation seminar volume of his published by Osmania University. He has been teacher of my teachers, and they always mentioned his name with respect and pride.

He is a true spirited scholar who understood the value of Samskrt and passed it on to next generation with great responsibility and understanding. He lived Samskrt to the core.

My humble praNAms to him. He will keep guiding students through his books.
