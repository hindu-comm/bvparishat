Sri Prasadji,  
  

Namaste. These were the lectures delivered in London and America. They are translated into Sanskrit. However, he has written some letters in Sanskrit to one Sanskrit knowing Gurubhai Swami Ramakarishnananda, his disciples Swami Shuddhananda and Sharatchandra Chakraborthy. Apart from these there are Stotras on Sri Ramakrishna, Shiva, Devi written in Sanskrit. Actually he has referred there that Mohammed had 'stumbled upon' realisation.
