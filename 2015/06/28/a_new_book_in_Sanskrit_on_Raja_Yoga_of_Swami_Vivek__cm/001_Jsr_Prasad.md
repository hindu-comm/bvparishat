Most respected Swami ji,  
  

Thanks for the valuable information. A crispy and clear message of Swami Vivekananda on attaining Yogic state by everyone is seen on the back jacket, written in Sanskrit. Is it his original wording (I am aware, he had written in Sanskrit too)? Also he referred to 'Paigambar Yogis.' Is this concept exclusive to people of Muslim faith?  
  

With regards,  

Prasad
