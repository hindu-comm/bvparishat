Poojya Swamiji,



Pranams.



Thanks for your sharing of this excellent information on an excellent book.



With regard to your clarification to Dr JSR Prasad , may I ask you if you can guide us to the English original of this passage.



'paygambara' पयगम्बरः is certainly not a Sanskrit word.



Context of the usage of this word in this specific passage may help us greatly.



Thanks in adavance for the help.



Pranams.
