Respected Members of BV Parishat,  
  

Raja Yoga of Swami Vivekananda is now available in Sanskrit. I have enclosed few scanned pages from the book for the perusal. The book is highly subsidized and priced at Rs.25/ only. The book is available at Ramakrishna Ashrama, Dr. Yajnik Road, Rajkot- 360001, Gujarat.
