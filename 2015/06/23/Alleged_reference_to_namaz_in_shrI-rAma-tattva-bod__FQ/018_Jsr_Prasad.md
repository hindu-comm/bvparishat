Probably you must be aware that Sri Agniveer is fighting tooth and nail using cyber space, against the tenets of 'real Islam' being propagated by Zakir Nayak et. al. Agniveer considers such people to be the real threat to Islamic principles itself. More can be read at \<<http://agniveer.com/category/society/zakir-naik/>\>. Besides this, he has many such interesting articles concerned with sanātanadharma.  
  

Thanks
