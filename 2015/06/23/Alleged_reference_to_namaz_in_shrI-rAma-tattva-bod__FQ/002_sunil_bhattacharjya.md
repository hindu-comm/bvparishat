Well said Prof. Nagarajji. Some such people criticize the idol worship by the Hindus, quoting the Yajurveda statement "na tasya pratima asti". These campaign wprkers don't know what Lord Krishna said about the pratima nor they know where is that pratima, which their prophet Abraham was referring to in their holy text. Unfortunately some our credulous people are swayed by these propaganda. As this topic is not in this thread it may not be proper to go into the details.
