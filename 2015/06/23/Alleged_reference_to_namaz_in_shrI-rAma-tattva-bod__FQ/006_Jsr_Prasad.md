Thanks to Prof. Nagaraj ji and Prof. Wakankar ji on exposing us to excellent perspectives of the issue in question. However, I beg to differ, we are more 'sAttvic' towards the hidden agenda and of such propaganda. My feeling is that they quote our slokas and correlate the concepts, fine, the danger lies with the outcome of such lectures. What if they propagate - 'since both religions share similar characteristics, though in limited context, why do you cling to the age old, idol-centric and ritualistic religion called Hinduism?' ' Zakir Nayak kind of tactics become old fashioned now.
