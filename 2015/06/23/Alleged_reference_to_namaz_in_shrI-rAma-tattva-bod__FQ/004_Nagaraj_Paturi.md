Dear Prof. Wakankar,



Thanks for sharing this excellent information about a good work. This is very much timely now, on the occasion of Yoga getting a global following.



Great souls like Shri Nizami have great objectives such as national integration behind writing such works.



Apart from just the namaz postures, many other similarities between 'Hinduism' and Islam, can be and should be highlighted for a harmonious understanding among people of the two religions.



I was responding to a specific question about a specific book by Vidwan Vishvas Vasuki. I could be wrong in my understanding of the objectives of the speech.



If the speech in question is like the book of Shri Nizami, intending mutual understanding among people of two religions andnational integration, I apologise for my misunderstanding.



Since, there are some wrong interpretations and manipulations, there is a possibility of misunderstanding from my side.



Regards,



Nagaraj
