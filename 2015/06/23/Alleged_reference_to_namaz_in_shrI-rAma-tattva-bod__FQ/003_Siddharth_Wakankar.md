Dear Friends,

  

I knew one very old gentleman from Baroda,viz. Shri Ashraf F.Nizami, who regularly practised Yoga for years,along with the Namaz also.

  

In 1977,he published a very small book,"Namaz-the Yoga of Islam".It is almost a booklet containing some 31 pages and it was published by D.B.Taraporewalla,Bombay.

  

I have his paper,entitled, "Synthesis of Namaz and Yoga",which he read at the Raipur National Yoga Convention on 03/10/1981.

  

He has pointed out that many of the postures in the Namaz are very similar to the Yogic postures. I may take the liberty of quoting some of his observations.

  

"I became convinced that the seven postures of namaz are the simplified and condensed versions of yogic postures in their external and internal qualities".

  

"If we can succeed in making these two communities understand that the basic principles of yoga associated with Hinduism are also the essence of namaz and of Islam,then they will give up looking at each other with enmity and begin to treat one another as brothers."

  

Our political and social leaders have a lesson to learn from this fact.

  

I close this by quoting Shri Nizami.

  

" At this moment,my mind went a step further in the synthesis of namaz and yoga.That is,this discovery can be made use of for furthering the national integration."
