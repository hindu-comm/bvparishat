नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

There is an Islamic Research Center in Hyderabad - some years ago they approached Police for permission to conduct a large meeting that is to be addressed by three scholars from Hindu, Christian and Islam.

  

They selected a Temple Pujari - Intelligence Dept contacted me -

  

It was on the day next to Mubai carnage - 100% Muslims - both gents and ladies .

I explained quoting from scriptures - there were no big questions -

  

They brought some kids - who can recite Quran - just Vedic students do .

  

Later one or two elderly persons started quoting from all Vedas - to the page.

  

They claimed - it was Sri Ravisamkar (Art of Living) who interpreted a term from Atharvaveda as applicable to Mohemmad Pravakta .

  

So there were so many Mohammads earlier as per Veda - not just one .

  

People from Hindu fold , may be for want of cheap name and fame , do such things .

  

Now and then they contact me for meanings etc.

  

धन्यो’स्मि
