I checked from the sources available on the internet, if Sri Sri Ravishankar Guruji really said that Atharva Veda talked about Muhammad or muhammads.



I now understand that it is Dr Zakir Naik and another some Dr Haq who gave the Muhammad interpretation to a sukta of Atharva Veda called Kuntap Sukta.



I found that this interpretation was contested by many Arya Samaji and 'Hindu' scholars.



There are some videos of 'debate(s?) between Sri Sri Ravi Shankar Guruji and Dr Zakir Naik. I did not find this info of Guruji agreeing with the Muhammad interpretation of Kuntap Sukta. Even if there is one that I could not locate, that is probably some nodding in approval or something like that.



People like Guruji are pious persons with their command over certain aggression reducing yogic techniques and other spiritual practices. Dragging them into scholarly issues does not match their forte and thus is unfair.
