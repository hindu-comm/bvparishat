Dear Colleagues,

I do not know if the following has been brought to notice by any member. If it has been kindly ignore the following..

The Adyar Library published a collection entitled Sāmānyavedānta-Upaniṣads. These appear also in a collection of 108 Upaniṣdas. Usually, barring the ten Upaniṣads with Śaṅkara's commentary the others are regarded as later and termed Minor Upaniṣads.

Even the Māṇḍūkya has been termed Prakaraṇacatuṣṭayam by Śaṅkara. This Upaniṣad cites the sentence Prapañcopaśamaṃ śivam. Vidhusekhar Śāstri strongly argued that it is posterior to Nāgārjuna (Mādhyamikakārikā) who states the said phrase.

According to me the Māṇḍūkya is the earliest Minor Upaniṣad.

Best
