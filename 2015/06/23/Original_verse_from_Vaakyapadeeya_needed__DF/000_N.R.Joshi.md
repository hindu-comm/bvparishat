Respected Scholars, Namakar!



I have the following English translation of a verse from Vaakyapadeeya. Could you help me please by giving the original Sanskrit verse either in Devanagari or in Roman with diacritical marks. Thanks N.R.Joshi



"Though sound is produced in a fixed order,

Speech itself no earlier and later.

Itself without order, it is produced

As if divided by the appearance of order. "
