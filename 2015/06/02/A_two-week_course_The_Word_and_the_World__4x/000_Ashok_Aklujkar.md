and

Broadly speaking, the course will be concerned with the place of language in Indian intellectual tradition. Analytical or linguistically oriented philosophy will be its major focus. Bhartṛ-hari’s Vākyapadīya,the oldest accessible and extensive work fitt    ing the bill, will occupy the centre-stage in it, but that text’s Interactions with the       and Nyāya and with Buddhist and Jain thinkers will also figure to a significant extent.

  

The course will be open to college and university students as well as to faculty from various disciplines.

  

I will team-teach it with Prof. Shrinivasa Varakhedi of Karnataka Sanskrit University, Prof. Parimal Patil of Harvard University, Prof. David Lawrence of the University of North Dakota, and Prof. Mithilesh Chaturvedi of the University of Delhi. Prof. M.A. Alwar ofKarnataka Sanskrit University and Swami Advayananda of Chinmaya International Foundation will also contribute to course content from the point of view of the disciplines of Mīmāṁsā and Vedānta

  

The deadline for registration (20 June) is not far away. Please use the the texts in the two attachments below for informing the faculty and students in departments such as philosophy, Sanskrit, Buddhist Studies, Jain Studies, psychology and linguistics about the availability of the course.
