Dear Prof. Ashok Aklujkar,



Thanks for the elaboration.



{{ All these have a wording suggesting that the view सर्वे सर्वार्थ-वाचका: was known, and, at the appropriate junctures, any logical difficulties that may arise because of that view were to be mentioned and countered.



Thus, although सर्वे सर्वार्थ-वाचका: itself is not attested in the available texts of the Mahābhāṣya or of the works of Bhartṛ-hari, the view conveyed by that phrase was probably known to the two great Vaiyākaraṇas and was acceptable to them in a certain context or level.}}



This appears to be the basic idea behind the various references adduced by you.



Thank you.
