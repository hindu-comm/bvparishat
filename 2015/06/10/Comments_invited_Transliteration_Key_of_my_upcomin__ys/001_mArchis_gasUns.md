Namaste, Nityānanda,

  

Not being even Akluskar's dog, let me still add my five cents.

If you speak about IAST it's strange to see that you write Devanagari as Devanagari and without the diacritics.

There should be no dot and end of each line of transcription.

Is hyphenation turned off?

I would add more space aboveVowels, Vowel modifiers, Consontats.
