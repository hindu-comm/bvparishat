The phrase "langhanam paramam aushadham" or "langhamam paramAushadham"
is said to be from an Ayurvedic text and Ayurvedic doctors use it quite often, albeit without quoting any Ayurvedic text. However I feel it could be a subhashita verse as well. Further this verse is not be interpreted isolatedly. There is another Subhashita verse, which says that weak people should not fast, and they are permitted "parimita bhojanam", which give them the benefit of fasting.
