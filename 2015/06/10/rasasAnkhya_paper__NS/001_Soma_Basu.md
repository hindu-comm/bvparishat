Dear scholars,  
I would like to know the last date of submission of papers to the World Science Congress. I have already written to Prof Vijay Misra, yet to get a reply.  
Would you provide me with the particulars of submission?  
Waiting for a speedy reply,  
Dr Soma Basu  
Associate Professor  
Rabindra Bharati University
