Dear Friends,  
  
Please find below the reference of a new book that has just been published by the French Institute of Pondicherry.  
  

  
  
***Bhāṭṭatantrarahasyam. The Bhāṭṭatantrarahasya of Khaṇḍadeva with the Sāraprakāśikā commentary by N. S. Ramanuja Tatacharya.***  
N. S. Ramanuja Tatacharya; associate editor S. Lakshminarasimham, Regards sur l'Asie du Sud / South Asian Perspectives n˚ 4, Institut Français de Pondichéry, xxi, 664 p., 2015.  
Language: Sanskrit. **1200 Rs (52 €)**. ISBN : 978-81-8470-204-0.  
  
The Bhāṭṭatantrarahasya of Khaṇḍadeva (17th c.) belongs to the Bhāṭṭa school of  
Mīmāṃsā. It deals mainly with the meaning of roots and suffixes, and their role in  
conveying the meaning of the sentence. Though this is a topic of grammar, it is widely  
discussed in Nyāya and Mīmāṃsā works as well. The Bhāṭṭatantrarahasya is divided  
into two parts. The first part begins with the definition of dharma, the main concept of  
Mīmāṃsā, and then deals at length with the meaning of injunctional suffix (liṅ),  
refuting the views of logicians and establishing bhāvanā (creative energy) as the main  
meaning of the sentence. In the second part, the author discusses the meaning of  
nominal suffixes (sup), quoting relevant rules from Pāṇinian grammar. Though  
Khaṇḍadeva's interpretation of Pāṇinian rules deviates from the grammatical tradition in  
some cases, he tries to prove that there is no violation of grammar by the Mīmāṃsakas.  
Given the complexity of the Bhāṭṭatantrarahasya, Prof. Ramanuja Tatacharya presents it here with his own  
commentary, the Sāraprakāśikā. Also included are an index of the Pāṇinian rules, an index of the kārikās  
(citations) and a bibliography.  
  
Keywords: Mīmāṃsā, Bhāṭṭa school, commentary
