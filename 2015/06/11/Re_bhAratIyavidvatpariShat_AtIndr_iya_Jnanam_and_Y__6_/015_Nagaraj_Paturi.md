1\. It is interesting that alternative interpretations are the basis of deciding that Patanjali is not a Yogi. To be accepted as a yogi ,a person must give a single interpretation and must not be open to alternative ways of explaining the same piece of data.



2.kapilo yadi sarvajñaḥ kaṇādo neti kā pramā /

  tāv ubhau yadi sarvajñau matabhedas tayoḥ katham //



Interesting.



This verse seems to be doing the khaNDana of pUrvapakshas:



pUrvapaksha 1. Kapila is sarvajna; KhaNDana : kapilo yadi sarvajñaḥ kaṇādo neti kā pramā.



pUrvapaksha 2. Kapila and KaNAda are both sarvajnas; khaNDana : tāv ubhau yadi sarvajñau matabhedas tayoḥ katham.



Any known person who took the side of the pUrvapaksha 1 and/or 2 ?



3\. atIndriyajnAni must be sarvajna. Since sarvajna is not possible, atIndriyajnAna is not possible.



As Dr Ajit Gargeshwariji has repeatedly suggested, it is better to close this thread while BVP's rational scientific image is intact.
