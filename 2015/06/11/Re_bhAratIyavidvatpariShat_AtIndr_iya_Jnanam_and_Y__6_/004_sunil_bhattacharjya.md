Namaste,  
  

In case the following fits in well in the discussion, I have the following information to share. There is a book in Bengali, which I read many years ago, which describes the converation of Lord Krishna and Arjuna. In that book, the Lord was telling Arjuna as to wicht action of the past (including in the past life) can result in which type of effect /result in the present life. I don't remember the details of that book at this time, but I hope that my Bengali friends here would know the details of that book.  
  

Regards,
