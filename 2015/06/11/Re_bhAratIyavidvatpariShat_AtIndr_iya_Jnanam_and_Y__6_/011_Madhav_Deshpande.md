I would like to mention two interesting points in this connection.
First, my late teacher from Pune, Pt. N.N. Bhide fervently believed that the grammarian Patañjali was identical with the author of the Yogasūtras, and that his understanding of Pāṇini's rules was pramāṇa, because it was based on his yogic perception. However, later on he gave up these ideas, after realizing that \[as one example\] Patañjali offers alternative interpretations of tapara in taparas tatkālasya, namely reading this compound both as a tatpuruṣa and as a bahuvrīhi. Those who are familiar with rules of accentuation will realize that these two types of compounds lead to different accentuation \[antodāttatva for tatpuruṣa, and pūrvapada-prakṛtisvaratva for bahuvrīhi\], and one and the same word in the same sūtra could not possibly have had two different accentuations. Pt. Bhide concluded that the uncertainty that Patañjali's explanations reveal probably suggests that he did not have any conclusive yogic understanding of Pāṇini's rules, but that he was making his best efforts to make sense of these rules.

  

The other point I want to mention is that the tradition points out that different yogis may reach different understanding, and that there no unanimity among yogis. Śāntideva, the author of Bodhicaryāvatāra says:
bādhyante dhīviśeṣeṇa yogino 'py uttarottaraiḥ. This results in the so-called authority figures differing from each other in their conclusions:

  

  kapilo yadi sarvajñaḥ kaṇādo neti kā pramā /

  tāv ubhau yadi sarvajñau matabhedas tayoḥ katham //
