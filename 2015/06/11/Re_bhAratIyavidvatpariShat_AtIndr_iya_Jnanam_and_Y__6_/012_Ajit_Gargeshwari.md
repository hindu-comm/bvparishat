Dear Dr. Mishra,  

May I request to stick with the title of the thread and not to bring in sagacious advises on re interpreting puranas and texts. I never said it should not be done there is a need to but that is not what this thread is about One thread one topic please thanks. You are welcome to start anew thread any time.  

  

Regards

अजो नित्यः शाश्वतोऽयं पुराणो न हन्यते हन्यमाने शरीरे।।2.20।।
