Ajitji and friends,  
  

My view has been that Puranas are poetic renderings of popular legends that were designed to be "teachings."  

Popular teachings take occasional creative license by the poet. "it rained till the earth became a sea" has  

poetic metaphors in it. Religious people take it as text and some "scholars" may make their own interpretation  

as they like. Such segmented stories are rampant in literature. It is the concept behind the story that needs  

analysis, nor the text or its construction. The latter is poetics.  
  

In my Ramayana journey, the rākṣasas have come. I do not think they are unphysical, but certainly  

exaggerated. Word constructs like mānasaputra possibly have interpretation other than a physical "son."  

This is where I thought more interpretative research of the literature may be required to break mythology into  

conceptual understanding. The physical interpretation is purely a production of the western theologians.  
  

Hope more scholars would engage themselves in interpreting texts and not follow the translations  

done in the last century etc. A myth may have a has a story behind it!
