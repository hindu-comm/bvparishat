Ushhaji,  

The question for me was validity about AtIndr iya Jnanam and Yogipratryksha for me scientifically its simply invalid. I did not ask puranic references nor do I need to know what Kanch Paramacharya has said or not said. I agree a myth has a story behind and the story behind myths like these are myths alone. I think we can close this thread if everyone has expressed their views
