Here is something on Puranas -by Shri Kanchi Paramacharya<http://www.kamakoti.org/newlayout/template/hindudharma.html/14/1/hindu/Puranas>

Specially these two chapters-

<http://www.kamakoti.org/hindudharma/part14/chap2.htm>  

<http://www.kamakoti.org/hindudharma/part14/chap3.htm>  

  

This book has answers to mostof the questions that are discussed here, as this one, presently going on-scattered all over. If one can patiently do one reading of whole book, one might find a convincing direction to look at things of our dharma. The vision, view point, explanation of the sage is quite logical and appealing. Hence sharing. (Please ignore if already aware.)
