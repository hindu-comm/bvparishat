To sum up there are no yogis who can see the past and future. If we keep aside such claims we can move forward. Why do we need to put blind belief in so many words, get examples from puranic stories which are basically mythology and justify such improbable beliefs if any one who has written on this thread have a personal experience it best kept out else since it cannot be subject to any scientific scrutiny Most of in this list are too familiar with mythologies yogis and babas
