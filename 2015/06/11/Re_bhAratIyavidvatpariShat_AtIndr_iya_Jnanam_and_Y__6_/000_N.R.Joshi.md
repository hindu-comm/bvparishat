Dear Prof. S. Korada,

Thank you very much. I accept your views on Atindriya Jn\~aanam and Yogik pratyaksha. In your reply since you referred to the past karmas of the individual from the previous life, I have interesting question for you as well as for other scholars like BVK Sastri, Prof.N. Paturi, Dr. R. S.Murty who contributed to my question on the validity of Atindriya Jn\~aanam and Yogika (Yogaja) pratyaksha and helped me to advance in my knowledge.

In Hindu religion there is concept of Chitra gupta (or angel by that name) who keeps the record of all the past karmas of souls. Is it possible to see the past record of the individual with atindriya Jn\~aanam? Has any sage, holy man or yogi of Hindu religion tried to read the record of the individual who approached him to resolve the difficult situation (illness, accident, loss of money or life or other problems) in his life? Was any cure recommended? And tried and correct results were obtained? Thanks N.R.Joshi.

नमो विद्वद्भ्यः



Vidvan N R Joshi has had the following questions --

  

1\. those sages who saved Vedas word by word and kept Atharveda mantras intact--it did not work.



2.So what is the use of Yogipratyaksha and their compositions.





3.If you say chanting those composition make peoplefree and they get Mukti from this Maayaa, then no further question



------



1\. those sages who saved Vedas word by word and kept Atharveda mantras intact--it did not work.



This question was there hundreds of years ago . Before going to मीमांसा न्याय , ज्योतिषम् , अयुर्वेद , योग etc. let me first give the
fundamentals --



जन्मान्तरकृतं पापं व्याधिरूपेण बाधते ।

तच्छान्तिः औषधैः दानैः जपहोमसुरार्चनैः॥



It is शान्ति (degree of intensity is reduced) of a disease or something inauspicious rather than निवारणा (cure) -

Any ग्रहमन्त्र or any मन्त्र referred to by you is for शान्ति only -



अवश्यम् अनुभोक्तव्यं कृतं कर्म शुभाशुभम् ।



नाभुक्तं क्षीयते कर्म जन्मकोटिशतैरपि ।



(प्रारब्धकर्म must be faced by all and for a मुमुक्षु the संचितम् can be burnt - ज्ञानाग्निदग्धकर्मा)

A person is suffering from high fever - ग्रहजप ( followed by तर्पणम् and होम - यथाशक्ति)  is performed - he may move and do his duties - fever is there .



न्यायदर्शनम् --



under 2-1-57 -- तदप्रामाण्यम् - अनृतव्याघातपुनरुक्तदोषेभ्यः (न्यायसूत्रम्)



we take अनृत only



Vedic sentences are not truthful and therefore they are not प्रमाणम् ।



न्यायभाष्यम् --



शब्दस्य प्रमाणत्वं न संभवति , कस्मात् ? अनृतदोषात् -- पुत्रकामेष्टौ " पुत्रकामः पुत्रेष्ट्या यजेत " इति । न इष्टौ संस्थितायां पुत्रजन्म दृश्यते , दृष्टार्थस्य वाक्यस्य अनृतत्वात् अदृष्टार्थमपि वाक्यम् " अग्निहोत्रं जुहुयात् स्वर्गकामः " इत्यादि अनृतमितिज्ञायते ।



one who wants a son should perform पुत्रकामेष्टि says वेद -- someone did it but he did not have a son - so वेदवाक्यानि are untruthful . When such sentences of दृष्टार्थ are false the ones of अदृष्टार्थ (for स्वर्ग etc) are also false !



न , कर्मकर्तृसाधनवैगुण्यात् 58



भाष्यम् -- 



न अनृतदोषः पुत्रकामेष्टौ , कस्मात् कर्मकर्तृसाधनवैगुण्यात् - इष्ट्या पितरौ संयुज्यमानौ पुत्रं जनयत इति । इष्टिः करणम् = साधनम् , पितरौ कर्तारौ , संयोगः कर्म , त्रयाणां गुणयोगात् पुत्रजन्म , वैगुण्यात् विपर्ययः । इष्ट्याश्रयं तावत् कर्मवैगुण्यं - समीहाभ्रेषः । कर्तृवैगुण्यम् - अविद्वान् प्रयोक्ता कपूयचरणश्च । साधनवैगुण्यम् - 
हविः असंस्कृतम् उपहतम् इति , मन्त्रा न्यूनाधिकाः स्वरवर्णहीना इति , दक्षिणा दुरागता हीना निन्दिता चेति। अथ उपजनाश्रयम् -- कर्मवैगुण्यं मिथ्यासंप्रयोगः, कर्तृवैगुण्यं योनिव्यापादः , बीजोपघातश्चेति । साधनवैगुण्यम् इष्टौ अभिहितम् ।



That is not correct - why ? because due to defects related to कर्म , कर्ता and साधनम् -- ’ by इष्टि , the father and mother , thru union produce a son' -- if - the साधनम् , i e इष्टि , कर्तारौ पितरौ and the कर्म heir union - are associated with the right and prescribed procedure then there will be पुत्रजन्म , otherwise न पुत्रजन्म ।



1.इष्टिः - 

कर्मवैगुण्यम् - समीहाभ्रेषः= क्रियाभ्रंशः (procedure not followed)



कर्तृवैगुण्यम् - कर्ता does not know the procedure(अविद्वान्) , कपूयचरणः = निन्दिताचारवान् (without good conduct)



साधनवैगुण्यम् - हविः(होमद्रव्यम्) संस्कारहीनम् ; उपहतम् = अपक्वं दधि , भ्रष्टं वा , मन्त्राः without proper स्वर / वर्ण ; दक्षिणा is the amount received from wicked people , or less or अदानयोग्या ।



उपजनः (पुत्रोत्पादनम्) --

कर्मवैगुण्यम् - मिथ्यासंप्रयोगः ( not proper union - the sperm did not enter the womb) . ( 16 days are ऋतुकालः - ’ ऋतौ उपेयात् ’ - गौतमधर्मसूत्रम् , 5-1)

कर्तृवैगुण्यम् -

योनिव्यापादः - योनिदोषः - a defective womb , unfit for गर्भधारणा (अधिकमैथु -नादिना - मैथुनम् once in two days) ; बीजोपघातः = the sperm is defective



Although it is not said by वात्स्यायन , we can bring in ज्योतिषम् and explain -



बुध , शनि and केतु are नपुंसकग्रहाः । Fifth house (from लग्नम्) is पुत्रस्थानम् - गुरु is पुत्रकारक - we have to check the horoscopes of both wife and husband and find out whether any नपुंसकग्रह is there in पञ्चमस्थानम् - गुरुदृष्टि or any गुरुसंबन्ध is there or not to fifth house - most of the time it is very difficult to estimate the बलाबल of planets - should there be नपुंसकग्रहs in the fifth house of both wife and husband and no गुरुदृष्टि , then they cannot have any children.

So do check whether the अथर्वमन्त्रs are recited by a good विद्वान् and all the procedure is followed perfectly .



शंकराचार्य in अध्यासभाष्यम् says - पश्वादिभिश्च अविशेषात् (पण्डितानाम्) ... प्रतिकूले जाते ततो निवर्तन्ते , अनुकूले च प्रवर्तन्ते - there is no difference between scholars and animals .



Finally अक्षपाद rules --

मन्त्रायुर्वेदप्रामाण्यवच्च तत्प्रामाण्यम् - आप्तप्रामाण्यात् , 2-1-68



मन्त्रs are being used as antidote to the poisons of cobra , scorpion
etc and आयुर्वेद ( सुखदुःखे हिताहिते - सुश्रुतः) are seen yielding results - so वेद is also to be taken as a reliable authority .



पूर्वमीमांसा --



Under औत्पत्तिकस्तु शब्दस्यार्थेन संबन्धः ... बादरायणस्यानपेक्षत्वात् 1-3-5  
there is a discussion --



चित्राक्षेपवादः --

वेद says ' चित्रया यजेत पशुकामः ’ - one desirous of cattle should perform चित्रेष्टि ।

Someone performed the चित्रेष्टि but there were no animals , immediately ?

First one should understand the sentence correctly - it did not say that the effect will be immediate - so at another point of time the result will be there - i e अदृष्टम् (कर्म) is also to be taken into consideration .



2.So what is the use of Yogipratyaksha and their compositions.



We see that thousands of people across the globe are benefited thru योगाभ्यास (fundamentals only ) and आयुर्वेद ( plastic surgery , laparoscopy etc- सुश्रुत) . Is it possible to author such great works by a single person without योगिप्रत्यक्ष ? Okay let there be a matching work now ! य़ोग is not working for IT people because they are trained at midnight - कर्मवैगुण्यम् ।



The दर्शनानि , वेदाङ्गानि etc are प्रमाणम् because they are authored by ऋषिs who do not have - भ्रम (confusion / illusion), प्रमाद ( अनवधानता = lack of concentration), विप्रलिप्सा (परप्रतारणेच्छा - a tendency to cheat others) etc.





3.If you say chanting those composition make peoplefree and they get Mukti from this Maayaa, then no further question



No , never , I do not discuss Mukti with everybody - in वेद there are both spiritual and mundane things .



मुक्ति is only for those who have शमदमादिसंपत्तिः , नित्यानित्यवस्तुविवेकः etc qualifications



धन्यो’स्मि
