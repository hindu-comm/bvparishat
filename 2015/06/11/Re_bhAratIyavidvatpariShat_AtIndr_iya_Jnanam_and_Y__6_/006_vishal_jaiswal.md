\> I do not have an answer for the fall out question that you may come up like : Why such a Yoga tradition got lost ? How can I /We the Indian /global society re-invent and re-engineer it ?. The seeking on this path is the seeking of right understanding of Yoga and Samskrutham, both of which have been molested badly for over three hundred years â€“ in India and globally, by taking the colonial exit to dump Parashara, Panini and Patanjali.  
\>  

Exactly - practical yoga can only be learned from a real yogi. Not  
through books.  
We wonder if such a yogi still exists in these modern times ?
