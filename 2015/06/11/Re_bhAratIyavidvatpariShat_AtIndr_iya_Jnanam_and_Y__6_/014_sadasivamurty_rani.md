Due to some personal health reasons and other factors though I have been watching all the ongoing interesting discussions in this thread I could not participate so actively.

Once I tried to explain what my inherited concept of Atindriya Jnana in one of my past postings. Again I would like to explain with a little more elaborative illustrations.

  

I agree with Ajit Ji. We may have several volumes of experiences shared down through generations related to mystic, divine, marvelous and astonishing events where super natural elements involved. We personally may believe them with all faith as we do our own life experiences. But when according to modern scientific evidence has to support such experiences we may utterly fail. So It is a different platform where we can discuss all such matters with staunch faith.

**Two aspects to be discussed:**

Here we should concentrate on such elements which can scientifically be proved. As far as the present subject is concerned there are two aspects to be focussed up on.

1\. Extra sensory Perception 2. Super Natural Powers . Here a question arises which of these two aspects is equal to Atindriya Jnana.

According to me it is the first aspect i.e. Extra Sensory Perception only which is equivalent of Atindriya Jnana.

First let us focus upon this aspect.

To understand the prominent constituents of our human body which are essential in our cognitive and operative abilities are:

**1. External set:**

Sense Organs: Skin, Eyes, Ears, Tongue and Nose

and Motor Organs: Hands, Legs, Speech etc.

**2. Internal Set:**

Antah Karanas - (Manas (Mind), Buddhi (Intellect), Ahamkara (Phenomenal Ego) and Chitta (The Life Principle)

As far as the the functions of External Set of Organs we don't have any doubt every one of us has his own unique abilities to use their sense organs and motor organs in getting his desired things done.

  

But as far as the functions of Antah Karanas are concerned theoretically all the students of Indian philosophy have a good and wonderful knowledge and others may or may not have enough knowledge of related theory. But practically 90% of people among us are less successful in using the Antah Karanas to the best of their utility.

We have never been trained since our childhood how to use or how understand their abilities fully.

Here I would like to present a little bit regarding the difference between Indriya Jnana and Atindriya Jnana.

What normally we perceive through our skin, eyes, ears, tongue and nose come under Indriya Jnana. It is called Direct perception which is the result of the contact of the sense and the object. Of course here is an intermediary element that helps the Indriya to perceive the object. That element is Manas.

Here what we have to note is that no sense is capable of perceiving the worldly objects in the absence of ***attentive mind***. If the perceptive abilities of a person are not up to the expected level we call him absent minded and not absent sensed. Why it is MIND that helps one in acquiring the knowledge of the objects through his senses. 

All this is Indriya Jnana only. This comes under the natural abilities of the human beings.

  

Now comes into the context the Atindriya Jnana (Extra Sensory Perception) which is also naturally existing but with in us and not external. Hence is this is NOT SUPER NATURAL but this is EXTRA SENSORY.

  

Here the Mind if trained properly can see the objects even in the absence of the senses. This is called **Yogaja Pratyaksha**. This name has two terms in this : a) **Yogaja (Born out of Yoga or Concentrated Contact of Manas or Mind with the Object without taking the help of Senses to perceive)**. This is a very much natural feature in this world. We find this kind of extra sensory abilities in Blind People, Deaf People and such others who have some deformity of senses. Of course they are better training their mind to be more alert than the normal people.

Similarly there are certain cognitive abilities of BUDDHI, Cognitive Abilities of AHANKARA and even of CHITTA.

BUDDHI has five COGNITIVE LEVELs: 1. Ability to memorized the Past (Smriti)

2\. Abiltiy to foresee the Future (Mati) 3. Buddhi (Cognition of the Events of Present time) 4. Cognition related to all the three times (Prajna) and 5. The Creative Abilitiy with the knowledge of all the three times. (Pratibha)

  

**Ahankara** is the source of Passion and Compassion. Rejection , Hatred and Disagreement.

  

**Chitta** alone has the rarest ability of preserving the seeds of Unseen Knowledge in the form of Latent Impressions (Samskaras).

These four abilities come UNDER ATINDRIYA JNANA OR YOGAJA PRATYAKSHA.

The better we train the better will be the abilities of these four Antah Karanas.

  

This was taught to me by my Grand Father (The founder Principal of Sri Venkateswara Ayurvedic College (Vijayawada) Andhra Pradesh for 35 years. He lived for a period of 105 years. He was a Yogi, Philosopher, Vedic Ritualistic Expert and a reputed scholar of all Sanskrit desciplines.

I shall deal with the super natural knowledge in my future mails.

Warm regards to all of you,

**Dr. Rani Sadasiva Murty**
