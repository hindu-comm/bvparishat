Dr Paturi,  

I have difficulty when a religion is practiced with textual injunctions. My personal view is that  

such injunctions add dogma. I love the Hindu style when it is open and inquiry based. I can  

do a puja and whether it does good to me or anyone is up to the individual. Japa is scientific,  

though I have not checked what happens neurologically. We all have faith and faith is important  

to operate in life. But my view has been that a faith is internal and has no articulation. A faith has  

to develop than get imposed. We do have the cognitive capacity to go beyond the words.  

Any judgment or evaluation is personal and internal. The human being is free at all time.  

These are my personal views. I experiment in various ways. I have a devi reading scheduled  

at home for tomorrow. We enjoy and immerse in the literary beauty and the melody.  

Best regards,  

Bijoy Misra
