Thanks Dr Ramanujan, for this excellent reference thatcomes close tomy idea of



"I think Chitragupta of Puranas corresponds to antaraatman (conscience)and his 'account book' corresponds to lingas'areera/kaaraNa s'areera in a taatvika parlance.



In that sense,chitragupta of each individual lies with and within that individual."
