\>\>"Religion is dogmatic and accepting". was what was believed and propagated in the early enlightenment period.



Things have changed enormously after that.



Scientific study of religion and religious practice has grown from several different 'scientific' perspectives.



Disciplines such as Cultural Anthropology, Psychology, History of Religions/Religious Studies/Comparative Religion and more have been trying to make sense of religion in 'scientific' ways.



Particularly Psychology and Religion have often been viewed as fields having common areas of enquiry and similar /comparable functions of problem resolving, healing, counselling and other such consultancy aspects sought after by humans in distress.



There is a discipline called psychology of religion.



Psychologists such as Carl Gustav Jung gave psychological explanations to many religious notions and practices.



To compare a psychological practitioner such as a psychoanalyst and a religious consultant such as a Yogi has been done as part of a big number of scientific studies.



It is well known that many words used by Sigmund Freud as terms for his scientific concepts are drawn from Greco-Roman mythology only.



More importantly than any of these, as a teacher ofclassical Indian literature, I can not keep on explaining portions of narratives taught in the class as some dogmatic practices.I would rather provide them tools from various available scientific disciplines to make sense of the practices that come as part of the narrative. These tools need not be limited to those of natural or basic sciences.
