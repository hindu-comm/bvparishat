Many psychological disorders, some having somatic(bodily) manifestations, some not having such manifestations of a patientare explained/interpreted by a psychoanalystin terms of the results of the interactions between id, ego and super egoin the unconscious component of psyche of the patientas a response to the actions performed by that patient. It can be said in a metaphorical way that such a psychoanalyst 'sees' the 'accounts' of the past actions of the patient 'maintained' inside that patient's unconscious. 



Part of the ability of the yogis and sages to 'see' the 'accounts ' of the past actions of the personconsulting them is akin to that of a psychoanalyst.
