Sir

  

I would say this is a popular poetic device, if nothing else. Example: the way KaSyapaprajApati "sees" the curse of DurvAsa and shows that Dushyanta is not to blame (Act 7, SAkuntalam).

  

At the level of the aggregate of past karmas, nimitta-Sakuna-sAmudrika-Jyotisha-SAstras all have the discovery of the aggregate of past karmas as their objective.

  

In Vedaanta, burning off of Sancitakarma is deemed possible, but not prArabdhakarma - so undoing is not possible for the "starting balance", otherwise past karma can be undone in the fire of j√±Ana.
