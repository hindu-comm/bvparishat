I should have said that the seminaries, madrasas and the Hindu religious schools have a mission of  

preparing people for the trade. In such situation, individual superiority is the thesis one possibly  

reinforces to be on the trade. In the older days, we didn't have temples in the US. Being a "Misra"  

I was asked to perform priestly duties like cremation or other rituals that I could not refuse. I did  
observe faith in close range (still do) and realized that human faith can't be analyzed. Lately I try  
to study yoga literature to understand and I am still learning. BVP is a great resource to learn.  
  

The point I wish to make is that the literature can be textually analyzed, but the text does not  

constitute the faith. The faith is internal and is in individual's own free thinking. Anything purporting  
to be producing a result must be tested. There is a lot of fraudulent business worldwide to take  
advantage of people in distress. The scholars have a duty to educate and empower the public  
So is my opinion.
