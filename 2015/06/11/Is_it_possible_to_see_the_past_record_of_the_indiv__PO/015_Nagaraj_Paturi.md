Dear Prof. Misra,



I respect your ideas.



As general observations, many of your statements are worth noting.



If your words are intended to guide me, I will be able to utilize the guidance and correct myself if you can point out specifically which words of me in this or a related thread prompted you to feel the need to guide me.



For example, I did not find any part of the thread connected to any textual injunctions.



Warm regards,



Nagaraj
