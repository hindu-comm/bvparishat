Dear friends,  

Can I request all to ponder less on what the past life has been or the future life could be  

than to be observant of our duties and actions in the present? Not that we must not  

be be mindful of the past, but not to make correlations, but do analysis. Indeed our whole  

history through the ages is imprinted on our mind and body, but complacency is  

not a an acceptable mode of existence. We must examine and contribute.
Somebody  

has said that Indian system is an open architecture. To get stuck on pattern matching  

is not a part of Indian scholarship. We must analyze than endorse.  

Just an opinion.
