This thread is being created from a previous posst on atIndriyajnanam and yogipratyaksha. Dr NR Joshi posted the following in that thread :



In Hindu religion there is concept of Chitra gupta (or angel by that name) who keeps the record of all the past karmas of souls. Is it possible to see the past record of the individual with atindriya Jn\~aanam? Has any sage, holy man or yogi of Hindu religion tried to read the record of the individual who approached him to resolve the difficult situation (illness, accident, loss of money or life or other problems) in his life? Was any cure recommended? And tried and correct results were obtained? Thanks N.R.Joshi.

  
Dr Ajit responded to him as follows:



Are you talking about mythology or blind belief? Why go to Puranas even now many astrologers know better than Chitragupta? I wish there are sages who can correct the present by knowing the future. Logically then there can be no future because its all known in the present and Chitra Gupta is off course available to help!!!  

  
Dr H N Bhat responded to Dr Joshias follows:



I think the question has been dealt with in Professor Korada's detailed replies. It is suggested through his several replies that one has to enjoy the effects of one's past karma-s in his past life resulting according the good and bad accordingly.

*अवश्यमनुभोक्तव्यं*कृतं कर्म शुभाशुभं \| नाभुक्तं क्षीयते कर्म कल्पकोटिशतैरपि \|\| - नीतिसार -४

Only according to this, the diseases attack. Only ripen karma-s begin to give the effects in this birth. There is no way to escape from these affects. The astrologers for see the effects and predict and prescribe प्रायश्चेित्त and/or शान्ति-s according to शास्त्र-s and these will minimized the severity of the after effects of good or bad deeds in the previous birth.

If these after effects include the relief from the suffering the disease from a yogi, then only a yogi would cure it using his r  
Yogic power or the treatment by a physician would be successful if it is predestined by the past karma-s. The acts done in this birth would custom is the acts to be done in the next births as after effects and so on. The physicians or yogins could not alter or modify the after effects of the past deeds.

आयुः कर्म च विद्या च वित्तं*निधनमेव च*।  
पञ्चैतानि विलिख्यन्ते गर्भस्थस्यैव देहिनः ॥
