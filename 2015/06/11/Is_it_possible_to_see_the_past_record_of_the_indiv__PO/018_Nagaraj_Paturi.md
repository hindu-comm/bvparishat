Thanks Dr Ajit Gargeshwariji, for agreeing with me.



I did not even say a categorical, unqualified 'yes' to the question of 'Is it possible to see the past record of the individual with atindriya Jn\~aanam?'



My answer was not even that yogis and saints have 'shown'.



My answer was that there are narratives where it is depicted that yogis, sages, saints and such characters are capable of seeing the past record of the karmas of the individuals.



These narratives include puranic, legendary, hagiographical narratives and personal experience narratives of individuals consulting such religious consultants.



Part of the question was "Was any cure recommended? And tried and correct results were obtained?"



Within the present topic, problems and cures come into question only when the 'seen'karma from the past record is that of paapa and notthat of puNya.



The 'past' in these narratives can be divided into two kinds within the present topic: 1. The one from the previous birth (since these narratives come from the culture believing in the jananamaraNachakra.)



2\. The one from the present birth.



I did not say anything about 1 in my posts. I only talked about 2 inmy posts.



Since there was a question "Was any cure recommended? And tried and correct results were obtained?"



It is in this context that I brought the theories of guilt in the unconscious and problems resulting from such unconscious sources and solutions offered into discussion. I only said that we can make sense of the narratives depicting yogiscuring problems by 'seeing' past karmas if we compare such yogis to psychoanalysts.
