As AadaraNIya Sivasenaniji has exemplified,narrativeswhich show a person being able to read the record of past karmas through atIndriya jnanam galorein PuraNas and PuraNa based mis'rEtivritta kavyas such as Sakuntalam

  

In maahatmya narratives of yogis, avadhutas and other such persons of actual real world, real history, usual formula is that the saintly person 'sees' the past record of karmas and says he can only reduce the severity of the effect but can not completely undo the consequences. Usually, in those narratives , the saintly person advises the approaching devotee to pray to get strength to face the consequence.
