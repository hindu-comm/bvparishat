We must be well-read scholars. The breadth of scholarship in the forum  

is spectacular. But we can not just ponder the past. We must think fresh  

and analyze. There is a separation between philosophy and religion.  

Religion is dogmatic and accepting. Philosophy is analytic and free.  

We must conceptually understand the terms and phrases as we come  

across in literature. But to stay in an accepting mode would be a blunder.  

Schooling should only be a tool, research should be the aim.  
  

I was doing a class on Patanjali yoga to a group of yoga students here.
I did  

stop in Book III since I didn't have the experience to analyze. Lexical analysis  

has little value, it must be semantic analysis. I will write when I retry the class.  
  

Thought to share my opinion.  
  

Best regards,
