The title of the thread Is it possible to see the past record of the individual with atindriya Jn\~aanam? The simple answer is Yes for a yogis as a few old texts of yoga & some saints have shown. For others the answer No if any one claims to the contrary it needs to be verified if it cannot be verified then such an idea should be confined to ones personal belief. This what is called science and our traditions have thought nny truth needs to be demonstrable and verifiable to one & all.
if this is what Prof. Paturi has been in saying I am in agreement  
Disciplines such as Cultural Anthropology, Psychology are exact sciences and discplines such as para Psychology past life regression Parnormal Activity etc are not Mixing science and blind belief neither justifies religion nor science
