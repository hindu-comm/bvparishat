A better academic way of wording Dr Joshi's question would have been:



There is a puraNic character called Chitragupta. He is described to be keeping the record of puNya and papa karmas of individuals.What does it correspond to in a taattvika parlance ?



Are there any narratives in ancient literatures which show a person being able read the record of past karmas through atIndriya jnanamand/or undoing the consequences of that past karma?



Are there any incidentsdocumented from the recent past which show a person being able read the record of past karmas through atIndriya jnanamand/or undoing the consequences of that past karma?
