Nagarajji,  
  

I am no guide. You and many in the group here have cultivated the topics  

all their life. I learn by reading various erudite explanations. By being abroad,  
and being in education, I am an observer on behalf of our children and the  
future youth. I have come to believe that we must separate our religious views  
from our philosophical views. It is difficult to question the religious views.  
Hence many young people reject them. Many religions do "connect the dots"  
to impose views. However philosophical views can be questioned and analyzed.  

As Sri Krishna is believed to have said that all texts must be rejected and  

the learning has to come from one's own living.  

  

Coming back to atIndriya track, I would think that superior sensory performance  

is possible, but has to be tested. It is "textual" when we accept because it  

is written somewhere. Accepting what's written is religion. The freedom of  

free thinking is Hinduism. I compiled a small book entitled SriKrishna Yoga that  

I did with the local Ramakrishna Mission Swami and is published from Advaita  

Publications in Kolkata. We say more there.  
  

Scholarly discussions on supernatural acts are done in academic places by terming  
them as "theology". Then they go into "comparative theology" which are further  
dogmatic. I would be happy if we emphasize cosmology versus theology.  

God created the universe and I have no idea how he created or whether he became  
a man or a beast. All I can say is that He/She/It is most likely somewhere there,  
possibly inside me!  
  

Please accept as my personal opinion.  

  

Best regards,  

BM
