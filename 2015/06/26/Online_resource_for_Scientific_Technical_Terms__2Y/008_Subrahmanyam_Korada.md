The Commission for Scientific and Technical Terminology - had conducted two Workshops thru Dept of Hindi , University of Hyderabad thru 2014-2015  

for Chemistry - Glossary of Telugu terms (there are Hindi terms also in the book - we discussed some Hindi terms also).

  

I did most of the work and as Prof Paturi remarked most of it is Sanskrit only - except d.u - mu - vu-lu ( prathamaavibhakti) .

  

The work was highly appreciated and they are planning for Physics.

  

Panini was thoroughly discussed for production of beautiful Sabdas.

  

I am directly responsible to the letter for any term .
