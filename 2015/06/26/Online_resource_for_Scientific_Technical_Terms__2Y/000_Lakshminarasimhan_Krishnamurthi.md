Respected Scholars,

Pranams.

We intend to translate the modern text books to Sanskrit. I will be grateful if comprehensive, standardized (Sanskrit root based) online resources like dictionaries for Scientific,Technical, Commercial terminologies( to ensure standardisation)

  

I could locate two such resources;

1.<http://e-mahashabdkosh.rb-aai.in/>

2.<http://dict.hinkhoj.com/english2hindi.php>

  

We need the one which is comprehensive

Kind namaskars.
