Dear scholars,

  

I knew this day would come! 

  

Please also refer to Acharya Raghuvir's English-Indian dictionary. Around 1930's itself he had compiled a large dictionary of scientific words pertaining to scores of disciplines. ALL words are based on Sanskrit roots and importantly he has tried to re-use any technical vocabulary already found in ancient Indian science. Of course it needs updating but it can provide great support to this most important cause.
