Sir

  

Would it be possible to elaborate as to who the "we" referred to in your email are?

  

Does it refer to a publishing company, an academic institution, a not-for-profit organisation, a Government entity, or an individual?

  

My view is that even more than translation into Sanskrit, there is a a strong need for building a Sabdakosa in Sanskrit from which various Indian languages can derive terminology for textbooks, etc. Presently in our daily transactions we use so many words which have only an English form (example: SIM card, ATM, AIDS, download, authenticate, automatic (as in cars), ambulance, anti-biotics, chemotherapy etc.) that speakers of Indian languages cannot effectively engage with modern way of life, if they do not know these English words.

  

There are many projects of building various Sabdakosas going on - I know of one project in University of Hyderabad where a Chemistry Sabdakosa is being prepared; earlier Sanskrit Academy, Hyderabad published a compilation of Sanskrit terms for technical words in IT. There was a proposal sometime back to do something for the telecom sector, but did not take off. It would be for the general good, if all these projects are coordinated by a central agency with common mechanisms for review, solicitation of views, deciding standard forms, disambiguation etc. and a central repository of the work being done in various projects.

  

Regards

N. Siva Senani
