Another post by aayushmaan Venkata Sriram is :



But the book he has is not exactly copy of Katyayani Tantra but some  
incorporations and refinements done by Shri Nrisimha Bharati and Sivabhinava  
Nrisimha Bharati Swamigal.

Pathashala Principal at Sringeri) and Shri Navin Holla (my close friend who is a  
tarka acharya at Sringeri).
