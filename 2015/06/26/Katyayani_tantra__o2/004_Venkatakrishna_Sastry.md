Namaste

  

It is welcome change that to see some one on the forum taking a bold
step to post the right way to approach a traditional text and studiesfor this discipline.

  

The method of study for a given text marked as 'Tantra', under the
'Shaakta' -Srividya categorization under the umbrella of Vedanta schools needs a multiple set of traditional tools and practical detailing. And these remain ' guarded secrets' imparted only under the Guru-Shihsya -Deeksha system.

  

This is different from the way the ' academics' study' tantra and present it as a debauch practice of ' Pancha -Ma' karas.

  

As a preliminary step before approaching the HH and getting in to an embarrassing position, it would be better to read the works of Sir Arthur Avalon who has provided valuable writing on this subject. His works may carry reference to this tantra also, as a part of Dasha Maha vidya deliberation.

  

On a concluding note, my humble suggestion: There is a world of differenceby which a traditional 'guru' provides guidance on tantra practice; and it is different from anacademic professor exploring the text .

  

While the specific text Katyayani Tantra may provide some 'special mantras' and methods', the foundational approach to tantra does not change from 'Maha nirvana Tantra', used by Sir Arthur Avalon. Sir Avalons books were audited for content and blessed for the accuracy of content by Sringeri Peetham as well as Bengal tradition.
