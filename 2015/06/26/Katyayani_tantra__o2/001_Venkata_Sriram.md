Namaste,  
  
Approach Shri.Bharati Tirtha Swamiji of Sringeri with humility and place before His Holiness your request. If Swamiji is convinced with your sincerity, then He would help you. It is available in manuscript form in Sringeri Library.  
  
His Holiness would give access to the library and would send one of His disciples (mostly shri.narahari bhatt, the prAdhAna srividyOpAsaka who performs the morning chandramoulishwara puja) to escort you. One has to read the copy in his presence only. Copying / taking notes are not permitted.  
  
However, swamiji would ask questions personally regarding the purpose of enquiry etc.
