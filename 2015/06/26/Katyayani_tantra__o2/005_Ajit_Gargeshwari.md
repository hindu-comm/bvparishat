The question asked was is text of Katyani Tantra available or not and the question is answered. I don't think the original question pertained to what books on must read on Tantra or the role of the traditional guru.  

The statement  
While the specific text Katyayani Tantra may provide some 'special mantras' and methods', the foundational approach to tantra does not change from 'Maha nirvana Tantra is incorrect please read the studies done on Tantra. I donot want to enter into any debate I Just emntioned
