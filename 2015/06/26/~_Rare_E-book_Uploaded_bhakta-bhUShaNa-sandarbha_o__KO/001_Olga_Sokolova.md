Hello dear Members!

This is Olga Mandodari ([www.mandodari.com](http://www.mandodari.com)), Vaastu Shastra disciple of late traditional architect, Padma Bhushan Sthapati Ganapati from Chennai.

I am doing a research on Vaastu Shastra. If anybody connected "white noise" phenomena in the space with the subtle sound from Akasha then please let me know about any publications about it. I would highly appreciate that.

  

Very sincerely,

Olga Mandodari
