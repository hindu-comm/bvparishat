the following is an excerpt from a post by



Prof. Dr. Walter Slaje

Deutschland



on Indology forum  
  
\>I am searching for textual evidence of a little-known Nyāya.  
  
  
\>In an article by Soutik Biswas “Why India's sanitation crisis kills women”  
\>(BBC News India, 30 May 2014), it was claimed that “Several studies have  
\>shown that women without toilets at home are vulnerable to sexual violence  
\>when travelling to and from public facilities or open fields. \[...\]“. One  
\>mother told researchers, “We have had \*one-on-one fights with thugs in  
\>order to save our daughters from getting raped\*. It then becomes a fight  
\>that either you \[the thug\] \*kill me to get to my daughter\*, or you back  
\>off.”  
  
  
\>This courageous behaviour of mothers fighting for her girls at the risk of  
\>their own lives reminds one of the \*śaśī-sarpa-nyāya\* (“the bunny and the  
\>snake”), known to some by hearsay only, but not (yet) traceable. The  
\>generalization here lies certainly in the fact that a (physically weaker)  
\>female (\*śaśī\*) effectively fights a (physically stronger) male (\*sarpa\*).  
\>The latter would be the aggressor(s), the victim(s) the (female) bunny  
\> and/or her young.

shared a video saying



Dear Walter,  
The nyaaya to which you point may have been based on actual observation:

Prof. Patrick Olivelle also shared the same video in response to the same post saying



Walter and all:  
  
I do not know abut this maxim, but this real life video of a mother rabbit doing just what the maxim say could be instructive. It was probably filmed somewhere in south India, I am not sure of the language of the people taping it.
