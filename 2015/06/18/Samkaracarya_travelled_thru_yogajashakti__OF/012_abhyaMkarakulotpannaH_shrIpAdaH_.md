Dr. P. V. Vartak noted down 24 points about Mars, supposedly observed by him during his Yogic travel to the planet.  
Here are results of Google search on "Dr. Vartak's travel to mars" - <https://www.google.co.in/search?q=Dr.+Vartak%27s+travel+to+mars&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a&gfe_rd=cr&ei=3FyGVbSMOMz08we9oIrQCA>  
  
22 of his 24 observations are said to have been corroborated by the American voyager almost immediately and balance 2 also, though somewhat later.  
  
Dr. Vartak has written books also on scientific dating of Mahabharata, (also I think of Ramayana).
