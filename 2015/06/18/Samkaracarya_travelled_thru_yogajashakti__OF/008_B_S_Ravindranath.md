Pranam,

 I have been the fan of subjects discussed on BVP and I follow all the threads of BVP, I am a very ordinary person and I request you to forgive me for expressing my views as I couldn’t tolerate because of the subject, as Sir Subrahmanyam Korada has told I always felt the same as he has said about the Yogis in the past. I don’t know any of the quotes or verses, what ever I know I have known by hearing from learned people like you and I always looked for the purpose of life but not the purpose in life, and when ever I think of it I get inputs from people like you.



 What I mean to say is the purpose of life is not just to do something in life and die one day. As the people don’t know the purpose of life they look for purpose in life and I always felt that is the reason for all the problem in the society.



I believe the goal should be to move to the next level of life like the yogis of ancient time did and left the quotes and sutras for the future generation. Moving to next level is to dissolve in the major subject and become the subject and feel (GOCARA) know the subject as we could describe the object only through subject, and ultimately to dissolve in the major subject as you all say and that is in Bramhan, and I feel when one dissolve in Bramhan, that person as a subject can be in any part of the universe at all time and know the whole universe, and I feel that is how the rishis and yogis could easily describe the whole mechanism and the engineering of the universe, I am saying this because of what all I have heard from learned people like you. (SRAVANA.)



 I once again humbly request you all to forgive me for my interference in this thread and if you feel what ever I have expressed is wrong please forget,



Thanking you

Sincerely,

B S Ravindranath
