Dear Prof Korada,  

These are textual materials. I would think that we accept them as possibilities  

till we subject them to test. It's possible that a person should be well drilled  

in yoga to gain the siddhis. To make a record of them as teaching material  

would need much stronger analysis, in my opinion.  

Best regards,  

BM
