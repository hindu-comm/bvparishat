Dear Dr. Gargeshwari,



1\. I can understand how difficult an asidhaaraavrata it is to moderate a forum like this one without allowing it to slip into mutual sharing of anecdotes of personal experiences of miracles etc.



2\. But at the same time, it is very important to keep it in mind that



a. The area of study of literature comes under humanities and to surrender humanities to the methodological domination of natural/basic sciences would be a disaster. Humanities can not be allowed to get crushed under the juggernaut of scientism. (This I am saying in spite of my considerabletraining innatural/basic sciences)



b.Sanskrit literature that BVP focuses on repeatedlyhas to deal with yogi kind of issues for three reasons:

> 
> > 1.a big number of authors are considered to be yogis, sages etc. >
> 
> > 
> > 2\. this literature includes books on yoga, tantra etc. >
> 
> > 
> > 3. the contents such as narratives cover yogic experiences etc.If > BVPgets stuck in scientism, it will end up >

c.Sanskrit literature scholars in India are from the traditional and modern backgrounds : already the university system has created a huge issue of imposing modernity on traditional scholarship, which quite often turns out to be imposition of western methods on Indian studies.traditional scholars might find a respite in forums like this one. If BVP replicates the model of imposing modernity on traditional scholars, the forum may not be able to retain its challenge to the beaten track modernity-dominated/ western method dominated system.



3.Paying lip sympathy to the rational outlook of the authors of Sanskrit literature and at the same time calling those portions of their words that do not stand the scrutiny of a different system than that of their own as 'superstitious'is not holistic and has the logical flawdescribed through the proverb of considering the cow good at its udder but bad at its horns.



4.I was happy to see Dr Gargeshwari to agree that fields like cultural anthropology, psychology etc. are exact sciences. That is one way out for not getting stuck in scientism in handling Sanskrit literature withoutcontradicting the tradition-insider's perspective.



5.To encourage a critique/interrogationof the existing modern methods based on the robustfoundations of the traditional Indian methodscan also be one of theunique features of the forum.



6\. At the same time, the efforts not to allow the encouragement of traditional logical methodsto slip into a pouring out of irrational beliefs not standing the scrutiny of any method should continue. I repeat it is certainly an asidhaaraavrata. I express my gratefulness in behalf of the list to the moderators for taking on the mantle.



This is just a sharing ofmy views in these matters, putting in my five cents.
