Dear friends,  
  

Prof Nagaraj's points are well argued. We have to distinguish between the trade science and knowledge. The textual acceptance  

of material is a western invention and our notion of accepting text is also influenced by the western methods. The Indian system  
has been analytic and every topic has been questioned. Actually we had a meeting of our India Discovery Center here and the  
topic of development of logic science came up. The depth of scholarship is massive. We have to discover the pedagogy of yoga  
and related materials with this great tradition as background. We can cite text as we may like, but we qualify our assertion  

such that the students can inquire. Had there been no inquiry, India would not have been successful in developing the elegant  

literature that she produced.  
  

My thoughts have been that we shouldn't use ideas as museum objects, but we practice them in real life. It may take time and  

might have its own sacrifices. My only request that let the fresh minds experiment and practice than accept. A higher state of  

physical life is not just an idea but it should have manifestation. We can always say that "We have heard" "literature states"  

"there is reason to believe" such that the young does not miss the window of inquiry.  
  

No "science" is exact. It works within an element of error not perceived by the human senses. The findings are only our limited  
discoveries. The truth always remains hidden. We have not defined a standard perceptual limit after which we may use the phrase  
अतीन्द्रिय. This boils down the analysis of mind and the powers associated through it. Extensive research of mind must be conducted  
both analytically and through meditation to find new avenues of human signature which were possibly documented in the olden times.  
These manuscripts may still exist somewhere. The strength and conviction of Patanjali must have deep analytic reasoning and  
documentation. This is my conviction.  
  

The "science" as we know today is crude. We have no model of human speech, we have some arbitrary theories of language,  

we make up arbitrary time evolution. These are all conveniences, but they work. They work because we don't have "insight."  
This insight is अतीन्द्रिय. So I urge all to think deeply to develop a science of "insight" that made massive creative works to be  
produced in India. Self-consistency is the beauty of "insight" and Indian self-consistency amazes me and I am a believer of  
conformity through a larger conforming प्रज्ञा that runs this universe and all other universes.  
  

With my best regards,  

Bijoy Misra  
  

PS. I leave Boston tomorrow and would have only sporadic access to computers. I will touch Mumbai, Chennai, Bhubaneswar  

and Delhi in India. if any of you are in these areas we may schedule to personally meet if possible. BVP discussion has been  

most beneficial to me. The two papers I am carrying were done after I became a member in BVP about two years ago.
