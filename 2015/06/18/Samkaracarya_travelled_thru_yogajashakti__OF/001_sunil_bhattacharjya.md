Namaste,  
  

It is very nice that you have looked at the issue in a practical manner by undertaking the journey from Kalady to Sringeri, situated on the bank of the river Tunga. . However kindly permit me to put another perspective on the Kudali-Sringeri reached by Adi Shankaracharya and also the view that he traveled from this place to Kalady.  
  

In the following Sharadabhujangam Stotram (verse 2b) there is mention of Tungabhadra. It is believed that the original Sharada temple established by Adi Shankara is at the Kudali Sringeri, which is situated at the confluence of the rivers Tunga and Bhadra and this place is about 15 KM from. Shimoga in Karnataka. From that point onward the river is known as Tugabhadra. It is also said that when Adi Shankara was in this place he felt that his mother wants him near her and as promised he had to travel from this place to Kalady. The regular motorable road distance between Shimaga to Kalady will be about 700 KM, but the bee-line distance could be around 450 KM. Sometime in the past the math shifted from Kudali-sringei to Sringeri, and from that time onward
the Sringeri math considers the math at Kudali-Sringeri to be its branch.
