नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

Sometime ago there was a question here as to whether य़ोगिs did know different places thru योगिप्रत्यक्षम् । I wanted to verify personally rather than simply quote from different texts , which people may stamp as a blind faith or भक्ति that is not acceptable.

  

My mission was simply to travel from Kalady(birthplace of Samkaracarya in Kerala) to Sringeri (Karnataka where he established a पीठम् and made प्रतिष्ठा of शारदाम्बा) and physically check as to whether it was possible for Samkara in 8th Century to travel on foot all the way (this is just an example to guess his flight and certainly not a plight , to other far away places like Kashmir , BadarI etc) .

  

On 9/6/2015 ( 7-15 AM) , I ( 60 yrs ) started from Kalady (with four family members) on a car (Hyundai - Verna- 1.6 VTVT Fluidic- 2013) with the latest technology ( Airbag , Sensors and Reverse Camera, ABS - Anti break-locking system for high speed driving on wet surface, Radial tires , Gear Indicator etc ) .

  

The road from Kalady to Udupi ( via Kannur , Mangalore) is 460 km and
one can drive at a breaking speed of 50 - 80 ( on Highways I maintain a breakneck speed of 110-140 even on a wet surface).

The weather , with the onset of Monsoon , was , for most of the part, wet and at times sultry.

  

After a continuous driving for 13 hours ( my maximum limit is 16 hours) , leaving 40 mts for lunch etc, I reached Udupi (गीतामन्दिरम्) at 8-15 PM.

  

On 10 th I started at 6-30 AM for Kollur ( मूकांबिका , visited by Samkaracarya) , 76 km - 1 hour - and at 9 AM left for Sringeri ( 109 km) via Agumba -

it is a hilly and forest terrain of Western Ghats with sharp turnings and dangerous steep narrow roads . It is simply a downpour and at the highest point one has to drive thru clouds with sight restricted to just 20 feet -

I reached Sringeri at 1 PM .

  

The above is a brief account of my travel in the said fashion from Kalady to Sringeri .

  

Can anyone even guess the situation during 8 th Century and was it possible for Samkaracarya to travel on foot to Sringeri ?

  

We/I do not blindly believe whatever is said / documented by others and at the same time we/ I do not believe those who are non-believers due to their कर्म in accounts that are authored by sages who follow सत्यम्, अहिंसा  and are out of the purview of भ्रम, प्रमाद , विप्रलिप्सा ( a tendency to cheat others), स्वार्थ etc.

  

So, my experience tells me that योगिs of that time had had the capacity to perceive the things and reach out to places that are at a distance .

  

The devices for such an exercise are described in योगानुशासनम् and other works .

  

Any further details on request / demand .

  

धन्यो’स्मि
