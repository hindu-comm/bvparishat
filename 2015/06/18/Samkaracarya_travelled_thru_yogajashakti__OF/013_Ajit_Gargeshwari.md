Well Said Professor!!  

May The spirit of yogic perception guide us . I am quoting a man offline message I recived from a scholar. We need to develop academic discipline yet. Many matters are not still settled among ourselves. Parameters of modern terms of research do not constitute a base for a good research. This is also a belief. Hence, first we need to think and reconstruct the parameters of research acceptable to all. Based on that we can start a fresh debate on all such issues I think. For all practical purposes we should have an electronic journal in BVP
