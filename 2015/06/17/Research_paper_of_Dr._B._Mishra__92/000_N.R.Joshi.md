Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



Many of you might have received the research paper " Evolution of Language-Semantic versus lexicon" of Dr B. Mishra. His paper is good topic to discuss his theories versus the ancient and modern understanding of Indian scholars in connection with evolution of Vedic Sanskrit. I am eager to hear views onhis paper from the community of BVP scholars. Thanks. N.R.Joshi
