We are into the structure of a word in Bhartrhari style analysis  

applying neuroscience findings. More informed people may think  

of developing proto-Sanskrit or proto-prakrit. We have to assume that  

the language that we observe is a highly structured material than what the  

original language might have been. We would have to trace through the  

interior languages etc.
