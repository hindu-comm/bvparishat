Namaste,  
  

Is it not a fact that the Vedic Sanskrit was what it was till the advent of Lord Buddha in the 19th century BCE (the date is according to the modern findings), but the Buddhist scholars took liberty with the language and there was change and we can call that evolution or devolution, depending on how we look at it? It is about six centuries after Lord Buddha that Panini gave a new frame to the language and that heralded the classical period.  
  
It has been my observation that while translating the ancient texts, particularly of the Pre-Buddha period, which have changed in many cases, even the reputed Sanskrit scholars have ignored the original meaning of the Sanskrit words and that has created a sort of havoc in some areas. May be, such issues can be considered for inclusion in the post-conference discussions.  
  

Regards,
