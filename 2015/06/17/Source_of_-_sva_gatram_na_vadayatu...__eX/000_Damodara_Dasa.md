Hare Krishna,  
Dear Vidvaj-janas,  
At varanasi I met one traditional person who quoted a pada -  
"sva-gātraṁ na vādayatu" and said that it is famous in their  
tradition. But he could not give reference of this verse. If anyone  
from the members of this group have any information on this it would  
be helpful.  
  
Thankyou,  
Damodara Das
