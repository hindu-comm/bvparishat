Subject: {भारतीयविद्वत्परिषत्} Paper on rasa and neuroscience  
Date: Mon, 8 Jun 2015 21:27:46 -0400  
  

Friends,

We submitted today our paper rasasāṅkhya to the World Science Congress.

Broadly it deals with rasa as a component of sāṅkhya cosmology with

corresponding evidence from modern neuroscience. In case you have

studied Bharata's nāṭyaśāstra and the sāṅkhya philosophical system,  
you can appreciate our point of view. The neuroscience part might be technical,  
but could be readable. Let me know if any of you would like to review.  
I can send you the advanced draft.

Thank you.

BM
