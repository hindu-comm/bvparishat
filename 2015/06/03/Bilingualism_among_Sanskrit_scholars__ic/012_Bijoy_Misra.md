Dear Dr Pota,  

I was suggesting to our friend educationists to find a path to educate  

our young. Two responses have been negative. It hardly matters  

personally to me. though I see the new graduates have little to do  
with India's scholarship. I think India has more potential in fundamental  

scholarship than we exhibit. Hence the young have to be mentored.  

I had to leave because of political instability in the '70s.
Currently  

people leave because India is not offering strong challenges.
Borrowed  

challenges exist in computers, pharmacy and engineering. We need  

to develop challenges in the fundamental areas of language, grammar,  
phonetics, cognition, brain science and literature.  

So is my observation. As said I don't wish to debate the issue. We are  

not policy makers, we can only suggest. People who are teaching the young,  
may comment if they desire.  

Best regards,  

BM
