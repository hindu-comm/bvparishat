Dear Bijoy,

  

I understand the various perspectives you have presented.

  

I will mention just two points here which informed my first response:

  

1\. We may want to move away from the mindset that it's not worth reading if it's not written in English

2\. Sanskrit and Sanskrit learning are undergoing a minor revival in India and the diaspora. This is largely due to Hindi language materials and due to volunteer efforts. Here I dont mean Sanskrit alphabet or something as elementary as that. I mean intermediate to advanced level original texts in vyakarana, vedanta and to a limited extent, kavya. 

  

Older people must help a young scholar recognize this and help/her move toward Indian languages e.g., Hindi. I feel thereby his/her journey would become easier and smoother.

  

Warm Regards,

  

Lakshmi Srinivasakrishnan
