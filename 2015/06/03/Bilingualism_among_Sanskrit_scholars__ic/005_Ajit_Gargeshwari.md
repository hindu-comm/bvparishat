I have point to add not to counter what Srinivasakrishnan has said. We have a situation in India especially those who pass out of Indian universities from the rural background neither know Sanskrit well nor are they equipped research methodologies nor they know Hindi well.
There is a need to change the method of teaching at grass roots that will solve problems at higher academia to a large extent. This aspects needs to be looked into seriously by the academia. This also raises one more question is the government spending enough on education the answer is big know less that 4% of GDP which is amongst lowest in the world
