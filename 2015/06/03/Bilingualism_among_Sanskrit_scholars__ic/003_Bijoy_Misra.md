Dear Dr. Bhat,  
  

Thank you for expanding. I don't think "true" is the right metaphor.  

It is to appreciate that the translation is a rendering and could be  

far away from the original. This appreciation would need the  

bilingualism that I mentioned. A language has a feel, color  

and diction. The process of transfer might take a long time.  

Indian authors have rendered Sanskrit texts in their languages  

as their version of the stories. Many of them carry the thrust  

of the story though they may change the story line to their  

convenience. In pure translations like in English, the thrust  

(characterization) does get compromised. I believe it is because  

of the use of dictionary than using one's bilingual expertise.  

  

Once the scholars get equipped with the skills of bilingualism,  

they may attempt newer versions. So is my thought.  

It may take a long time, but need initiation such that the scholarship  

disseminates. It is unfortunate that languages are getting wiped out  

in favor of English in the name of development!
