Friends,  

Is there any effort in India to help develop bilingual skills among  

the scholars who are knowledgeable in Sanskrit literature and  

scriptures? English communication has become a default  

standard for a number of reasons. English seems to be the language  
to reach out to others and the young. Whole new translations  

of textual material is required for dissemination and education.  

Most of the aspiring scholars depend on English texts which  

are mostly erroneous and done in haste with limited understanding.  

To help create new translations is a task. I hope this aspect of  

public education is being addressed by the Govt and the institutions.  

Well written and well-edited texts on Indian heritage and scholarship  
are very much required all over the world.  

Best regards,  

Bijoy Misra
