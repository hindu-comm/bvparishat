Dear Dr Srinivas,  
  

I appreciate your response.  
  

A few points:  
  

1. India was occupied/colonialized and unlike China and Japan, English has  
  become the default communication language as I see. You can observe  
 it right here in BVP.  

  

2. Indian literature/scholarship has value for the Indian youth.
Serious scholars  
 outside have to know Sanskrit well. There are people who pursue Indian material  

 with disrespect and would continue to do so. They do the study for comparative  

 research and not to create conceptual extension. It is a different problem and  
  is connected with politics, bias and cometition-complex as I see..  
  

3. India's material has value for the world of knowledge. People of Indian origin  
 must try to assimilate them and disseminate in the world. We must come out  
  from descriptive work to analytic work. The latter would need the understanding  

  of other systems, sciences, other research and critical thinking.  
  

4. I don't see any western scholar seriously taking India studies to champion  

  India. People who are steeped in India are very few. I myself take it as a  

  hobby. Most in the west know very little about India's cultural roots.  

  

5. People like me observe that the translations are wrong, but we are helpless.  
 We get further frustrated when researchers back home use the erroneous  
 texts without having the expertise to reject. Ignorance is massive!  
  

6. Being a grandparent now, I am more concerned with the education of the new  

  young. I see the children abroad and children in India use English. They like  

  to know scriptures and they pick up whatever is available. This is where I think  

  the scholars group like you and others possibly can make a difference.

  
7. These English-educated boys and girls are bright and are not survival-oriented  

  as the previous generations were. We have to find a way to give them material  

  to study to think fundamentals in mind, speech, thinking, words, cosmology,  

  rhyme, prosody, cognition, health to turn them to extend India's knowledge  
 sciences than letting them idle away with mundane operational employment.   
  

I do understand that it's easy to suggest. But I think India must convert herself as  

a knowledge leader with the huge intellectual potential she has. This potential is  

in our children. We also had but we had survival problems. With suitable schemes,  

I think we can help create new scholars of fundamental sciences that India  

discovered and analyzed. These scholars can take the sciences to new heights.  
  

I am not sure if India has released herself fully from the shackles of colonialism.  
There is a competition between survival and intellectual pursuit. The quality of the  
latter needs a different grounding than what the country provides. So is my view.  

  

Best regards,  

BM
