I don't wish to argue, I have to leave town.  

You have to imagine that scholarship does not happen in a vacuum.  

In olden days people had to learn Sanskrit to help import and extend ideas.  

In modern days we need to learn other languages to learn of other ideas.  

Gandhi won't know of Tolstoy if the latter was not translated.  

One can question why it is English, but that has historical and colonial  

roots which cannot be immediately cleared. But the scholars have to  

be challenged to extend ideas than reread and rewrite the old. One must  

be contextual to the world as our scholars were in their days.  

Hope some educationists may consider. I know it is hard and it also  

would need our own personal recalibration to the world of knowledge.  

India has originality in thinking and that has to be re-engineered among  

our youth, starting early in school with good good exposure and mentoring  

in knowledge and scholarship.  

Best regards,
