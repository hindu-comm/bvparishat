Dear friends,  
  

We are not talking about the national policies, which are based on politics,  

economy and popular will. What I think we should strive to do is to help  

create a few regional centers of excellence in Sanskrit studies.
Indian  

literature is powerful because the authors examined a whole lot of issues  

and argued the logic before creating a thesis. Examination of fundamental  

debatable ideas needs an environment of inquiry and willingness to immerse  
in serious scholarship.  

  

The world of ideas has expanded and a scholar in the present day needs to  

keep up with the available knowledge systems as the scholar was doing in  

the old days. This is where the new thinking has to come in. As I observe  

we are preparing scholars as the world was frozen in 800AD. We have to  

realize that the modern scholar has a large audience to conquer. This  

needs different motivation, deeper industry and more supportive environment.  
  

Some scholars in the west tout to fill this with cursory knowledge of Indian  

scholarship. Such scholarship has to develop in India itself by people who  

have appreciation of what India is and why the thought process moved in the  

direction it did. The cosmological basis of Indian scholarship is the most  

unique in this context. The young scholar has to understand this fundamentally  

through his/her learning, reading and contemplation. A university or a center  

for excellence should provide residence to such scholars who have aptitude for  

strong analytic research. The process has to be highly competitive and the  

scholar should be nurtured to extend the Indian knowledge system through  

analysis and contemplation.  
  

So is my thought from this far away land.  
  

Best regards,  

Bijoy
