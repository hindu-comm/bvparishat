With due respect, Prof Misra, why must Sanskrit scholars learn English? Are Classical Chinese or Japanese scholars learning English?

  

If most of the aspiring scholars depend on erroneous texts, then producing better translations is a desideratum. English itself is not indicated here. It should actually be done in Hindi. Today most young Indian people who are learning Sanskrit seem to resort to materials which are available in Hindi. As luck would have it, more and more Hindi language materials are becoming available.

  

Much of the English language manuals for Sanskrit produced during the colonial era seem to be meant for students with Latin or European classical backgrounds or weighted heavily in favor of people whose first language is a European language. Their language is archaic and I do not know what to make of examples in a Sanskrit manual with names like Tullio, Gaius or Marcus (Apte's Sanskrit composition is just an example). The more modern Sanskrit manuals produced in the recent past in the US seem to be oriented to the market of the First year Sanskrit student who is typically going on to Buddhist Studies or something similar. These manuals can hold a student's attention for one year, no more.

  

As for translations of texts, the purpose of the English translations has always been clearly hegemony. Sanskrit schiolarship and perpetuation of Sanskrit knowledge for them is merely a by product. Please refer to Bernard Cohn ("Colonialism and its Forms of Knowledge") or some similar authority for convincing argumentation in this direction. Far be it from me to make any argument on this topic. 

  

Other than the fact that English language materials would only help Sanskrit professors overseas, for which you seem to think the Indian taxpayer must pay, what other utility does it have? Let Harvard or Yale or Oxford pay if it wants pedagogical materials for Sanskrit, wouldn't you think? Meanwhile has any serious attempt been made to ascertain availability of such materials in Hindi?

  

The argument therefore that Sanskrit teachers in India must learn English and produce pedagogical and scholarly materials in English would only result in defining their roles as suppliers of raw material and in placing them in a position of subservience and supplication to English speaking teachers and scholars in the US and elsewhere. Has this already not happened in our history in the 19th century? Please refer to 'The Pandit and the Professor', a monograph by Prof MM Deshpande in this regard. History shall really be the judge of whether the supplanting of the Pandit by the Professor has led to the betterment of Sanskrit itself.

  

The Internet and the easy methods of dissemination of pedagogical materials and of pedagogy itself has led to a modest revival of Sanskrit in India and among the Indian diaspora. This has happened without much institutional help. It's also, by and large, supported by Hindi language materials. It's true this movement has not produced scholars yet but it will, in time.

  

Today in the US the amount of Sanskrit studied in non University circles far exceeds what's being studied in universities. I do not think it's a tragedy at all but merely a sign of the times. At the risk of a parallel, university Sanskrit education in the US and Indian people educating themselves are akin to Encyclopedia Britannica and the wikipedia. Surely standards have to be addressed but I venture to suggest that the English language output from organized academia is not without issues. 

  

I suppose the question is whether one wants to buck the trend and turn the clock back or do what's good for Sanskrit.

  

With Warm Regards,

  

Lakshmi Srinivasakrishnan.
