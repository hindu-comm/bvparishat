I should have also commented on the last point you made on the Sanskrit studies.  

It is not the Sanskrit alphabet or the grammar studies that I am talking about.  

It's cosmological and philosophical studies that would have value to attract  

the young. Revival of Sanskrit has little to do with the revival of India's knowledge  

system. It is the latter that has value for the future world and beyond. India  

must create the environment for similar inter-disciplinary studies where the students  

have the critical understanding to think on as simple thought as "what's space?"
