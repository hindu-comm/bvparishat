Aayushmatee Vidushee Reeta,



Did you go through the reference provided by AadaeaNIya Sivasenaniji?



That is from Sankrit literature only isn't it?



Your "Can you pl give some references from Sanskrit literatures and Puranas?" was intriguing.



Though the episode is all celestial narrative, it has womb-lending, surrogate breast feeding aspects.



Best wishes,
