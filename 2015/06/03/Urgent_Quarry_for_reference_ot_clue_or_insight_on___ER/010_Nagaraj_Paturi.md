At <http://www.livestrong.com/article/77414-surrogate-father/>



three meanings are given for surrogate father :



1\. Kanva type



2\. Niyoga- Vyasa type



3\. Not able to remember from Itihasa Puranas



Surrogate broadly means substitute. But

'Surrogate mother' is being used more frequently for womb donor only.
