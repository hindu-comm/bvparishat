Namaste!

  

Reference to womb transfer may not be their in our ancient texts, but transfer of embryo is certainly alluded to in the Jaina Kalpa sutras. The birth of Mahavira is said to have happened after Naigamesha on the orders of Indra shifted the embryo from the womb of the BrahmaNa lady
Devananda (?) to that of queen Trishala. The Kalpasutra also says that Arhats are never born to BrahmaNas ! I am writing from memory; details are to be confirmed.
