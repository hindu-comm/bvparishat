Dear Reetaji,  
  

Kunti was not Krma's Surrogate mother but his (Karna's) own mother.
Durvasa gave the five mantras to Kunti so that she could invoke any five of the gods, for son. Obviously she was to have used the mantras only after her marriage. The curiosity got better of her and she (Kunti) invoked Lord Surya, even before her marriage. Lord Surya had to oblige her by blessing her for a son and the blessing to be effective she obviously had to have conjugal relation with Durvasa . Lord Surya was more like Karna's god-father than biological father, somewhat like Lord Vayu was the godfather of Hanuman.  
  

As regards Surrogacy in ancient Indian text, probably we can examine the case of transfer of foeus from Devaki's womb to Rohini's.  
  

Best,  

SKB
