नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

Can I equate Surrogacy with Niyoga? --- विदुषी रीटा  

  

  

नियोगः -- appointment of a wife or widow to produce a son from intercourse with an appointed male - the son belongs to the husband but not to the appointed male.

  

Surrogacy -- An arrangement by which a woman gives birth to a baby , on behalf of a woman who is physically unable to conceive - the baby belongs to the latter.

  

धन्यो’स्मि
