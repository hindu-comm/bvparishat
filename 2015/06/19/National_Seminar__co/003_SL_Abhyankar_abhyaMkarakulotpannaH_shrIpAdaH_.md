My observations -  

-   Is not "Intellectual Traditions" too broad a theme ? It is good that
    the organizers have identified a "Contents"-list. Otherwise one is
    left to wonder, whether there is any subject down the timeline and
    ahead, across the universe, which is not intellectual and which does
    not have a tradition.  
-   In the "Contents"-list on the front-page of the brochure 9 topics
    are identified. There are 9 "Resource Persons" identified.  
-   One session is outlined to be on Avadhan demonstration. One can
    deduce that that session may be conducted most obviously by Dr. R.
    Shankar. -   Resource persons of other topics are very learned persons and seem
    to be capable of handling their sessions by themselves. In addition,
    Jain University would have in-house faculties handling the topics
    mentioned.  

These observations may become answers to queries by Mr. Udayan Hegde and Shree Latha Lankipalli.
