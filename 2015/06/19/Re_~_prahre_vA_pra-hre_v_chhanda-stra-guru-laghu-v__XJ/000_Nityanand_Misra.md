There is a difference of opinion between poets/prosodians. But there is no question of a difference of opinion between grammarians and prosodians, as the Sutra is not a part of grammar works but only prosody works. The domain and objectives of*laghu*and*guru*nomenclatures are different in grammar and prosody. As per grammar, a *hrasva*or short vowel followed by *anusvara*, *visarga*, or at the end of foot is a *laghu*, but as per prosody, it is a *guru*. To a grammarian, *laghu* and *guru* are nouns which have applications in Sutras likeदीर्घो लघोः or गुरोश्च हलः, but not in prosody. To a prosodian they are the units of meters. So there is no need for a harmony between grammar and prosody, as the disciplines have different objectives.

  

Why many books do not have *prahre va*is because there is a difference of opinions between prosodians on whether the Sutra is part of the original work or a later addition.

There are more, Apte dictionary lists 'br' and 'kr', and the commentary you attached also has an example with 'gr'.

Prakrtapaingalam may have more examples. I have a copy but it is not with me right now.
