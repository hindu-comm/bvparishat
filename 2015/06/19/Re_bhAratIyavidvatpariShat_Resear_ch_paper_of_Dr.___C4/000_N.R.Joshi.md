We are into the structure of a word in Bhartrhari style analysis

applying neuroscience findings. More informed people may think

of developing proto-Sanskrit or proto-prakrit. We have to assume that

the language that we observe is a highly structured material than what the

original language might have been. We would have to trace through the

interior languages etc.
