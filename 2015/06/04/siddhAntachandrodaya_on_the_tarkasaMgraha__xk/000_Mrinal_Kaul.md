Dear All,

  

An Indology friend is looking for the Siddhāntacandrodaya commentary on the Tarkasaṃgraha writtenby Kṛṣṇa-dhūrjaṭi-dikṣita. This was published by Gujarati Printing Press in 1923. Would someone happen to have a scanned copy of this text? Both of us would be highly obliged for this favour.

  

Best wishes.

  

Mrinal
