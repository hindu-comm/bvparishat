Dear friends,  
  
I wonder why Tara and Mandodari, the two great ladies of Ramayana, whom the pious Hindus remember as belonging to the group of the five great ladies called "Pancha-kanya", have not received the attention
they deserved. It was probably Tara's curse, which made mother Sita leave Lord Ram at the end. It was also probably Mandodari, who could have saved Ravana at any stage till his end, had the latter cared to listen to her advice.  
  

Regards,
