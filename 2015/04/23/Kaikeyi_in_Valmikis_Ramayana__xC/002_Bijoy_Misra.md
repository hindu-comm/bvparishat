Dear Dr Putari,  

Interesting. I will check with other Ramayana(s) as my language proficiency  

would allow. But Bhasa's story would be a different Kaikeyi than Valmiki's.  
I am glad that Bhasa let her speak up. I have heard that she has been rendered  
more kindly in other versions of the retelling of the story.  
  

In Valmiki, the way it appears to me is that Bharata in general was unhappy  
with Kaikeyi's haughtiness in dealing with people. Their relationship lacked the  
love and respect between a mother and a son. Kaikeyi might have noticed it  
but did not make effort to correct herself. She might have agreed to Manthara's  
plot such that Bharata could be appeased. She ignores Manthara's counsel  

in the beginning but falls in when Manthara says that Bharata could be  

eliminated by Rama for maintaining order in the land. She does not reject the  
conjecture. It is possible that she was aware of such rivalries in royal families  
that happen in the pursuit of power. But she seems totally unprepared for the  
negative reaction from Bharata. So I thought she failed to read her son right,  
which might have its own interpretation of mother-son contact and relationship.  
  

The heightened drama of Rama's exile and Dasaratha's death is a part of  

storytelling that could be Valmiki's art. A version of the story could have been  

a variant where Dasaratha accepts Bharata, but Bharata goes out to fetch Rama.  

Bharata is a strong character in Valimiki. But my thinking is that Valmiki did not  
want him to outshine Rama. An author has a final say on how the story might  

turn! Personally I was not prepared for Dasaratha's immediate death.
Once  

Kaikeyi is blinded with her ambition, she has hard time recovering from it.  
  

Currently in Boston they are trying a young man who got engaged by his  

brother to explode bombs in public places. It is quite possible that the bombing  

was not the young man's idea but he was an accomplice to his brother. I am told  

that he has not recanted his action so far. His mother and relatives do not see  

the bombing as a bad act. In Manthara, I see Kaikeyi's ancestral values in a  

similar way.  
  

Best regards,  

Bijoy Misra
