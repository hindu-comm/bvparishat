Dear scholar friends,  

In order to explore the literary creativity in Ramayana I try to write  

about my analysis in English and Hindi every two months. The Hindi  

articles are published through a magazine called गर्भनाल from Bhopal,  

India. I am attaching the pre-release of my article on Kaikeyi.  

It would be formally published at the end of the month in the May issue.  

Schaolrs who are familiar with Valmiki may appreciate my point of view.  

I would be grateful to receive any articles on Valmiki's characters  

analyzed in a literary context. I have done Dasartha, Kaushalya and  

Sumitra in the earlier months. I will try Manthara next month.  

Best regards,  

Bijoy Misra
