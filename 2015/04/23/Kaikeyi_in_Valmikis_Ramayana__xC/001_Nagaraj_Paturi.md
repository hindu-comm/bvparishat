One way of looking at Ramayana-centred plays is to see them as playwright's understanding of Valmiki's work.



Seen that way, we can see Bhasa's analysis of Kaikeyi's character in PratimaanaaTakam.



He provides an opportunity to Kaikeyi to defend herself in front of Bharata.



She almost says that she was under the spell of the curse of S'ravaNakumAra's father. It is the power of the curse which made her speak the way she did.



She begins her defence by saying, त्वं न आणासि महाराअस्स सावं (त्वं न जानासि महाराजस्य शापं)



Makes Sumantra narrate the story of s'Apa.



Finally succeeds in making Bharata say "अस्ति पांडित्यं सम्यग्विचारयितुम्"



Bharata even apologises to her.



This may or may not be Bhasa's defence of Kaikeyi. Prabably, he tried to present Kaikeyi's way of looking at the whole situation or a presentation of the method of likes of Kaikeyi in handling the situations like this.
