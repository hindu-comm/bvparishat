As on now, through internet search, I could see that shanaa devee and kanaa devee are two abundantly given personal names in North India. Found in many states like Rajasthan, Jharkhand, Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand.



One of the pages was mentioning a Devi Bhagavata story regarding kanaa devee. Nowadays, the google books search takes us to the cover page of the book not directly to the result page. I could not locate the page.



In any case, looked at from this perspective, if this method works out in resolving the case, this case joins the premierlist of interesting psychoanalytical case studies.
