Dear Scholars,

  

I am hoping that you can help me with a question and not think that this is a trite question nor in anyway offensive. In no way is this meant to be.  

It is because of your learning that I am asking here in this forum.

  

I am needing some help finding the meaning of some words that I don't know the language of. **NAMASHA NAA****KANAA**

  

Actually, I am posting for a friend.

  

Here is the story.  

A woman friend was walking Girivalam around the Holy Mountain Arunachala. It was a dark area and she was lagging behind her friends.

A man came up behind her and attacked her. Groped her and more.

She became relatively quiet, both as he was very strong and fighting was probably not so possible and also because she felt out of her body in a way. Then he left.

  

After he left, she was in shock and then her "shakti" arose, and she started screaming these words:**NAMA SHA NAA ****KANAA** over and over.

She was surprised, as the words flew out of her mouth on their own. She had never heard them before.

  

She is not sure how the words are broken up noractually spelled nor what language nor what they mean? **But she wrote them for me in the way she yelled them. This is how they came out.**

She is asking for some clarity.

  

Since you are all so learned, I thought that if anyone can, you most likely may know something. And I am appealing to you for your graciousness and time and hope you can shed some light on these words for her. She knows no one to ask.

  

Thank you so much,

  

Chandi Devi
