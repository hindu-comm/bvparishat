Your guess is as good as mine



 -Vidwan Sunil Bhattacharjyaji



AadaraNIya Sunilji,



If you thought I claimed my guess to be superior to yours, yours was a mistaken understanding of my words.



I was sincerely happily excited by your mention of grama-devis. Now,
this post of you mentioning deification of women gives me greater happiness. All this is because I am a specialist professional/career researcher of grama devis, deified women etc. among other things of folk culture. But my field area is south India. So your info from north India truly excited me.



Your info dispels the notions such as these cults being uniquely south Indian.
