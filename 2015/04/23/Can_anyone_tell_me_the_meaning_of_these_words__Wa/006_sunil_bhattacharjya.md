Namaste,  
  
It could be possible that in her childhood that lady (with Hindi as her mother-tongue or father language) could have heard some stories of grAma-devis like शना देवी and कना देवी giving protection to the helpless. That may be the reason why at the time of her distress she could have called for the protection of शना देवी and कना देवी.
