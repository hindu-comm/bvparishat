Sri Bhattacharjya Ji,

  

I have lived at the feet of Arunachala for the past 16 years, 22 years in india, in total, and I can tell you, first hand, that many many magical things happen here.

Besides the Temple, which is Ancient and which carries with it amazing energies and besides it's personal history, there are rocks sitting on the Mountain, for centuries that people have sworn, looks to be Rishi's still sitting in meditation. In some places the energy of the mountain moves you fast, and others slow. You have no control, if you are sensitive, at all. The AMMA's here all have strong powers, as does Unnamalai,(Parvathi) in the Arunachalaeswara Temple. Notwithstanding, Shiva, in the form of Arunachala and Arunachaleswara (Lingam) in the Temple, is full of power and fire and Light.

  

I, myself, had had quite a few profound visual as well as psychic, let alone Spritual experiences here. Unable to speak it, as it is all merged into Oneness.

Definitely, the Devi's protect, and it didn't surprise me at all, when Jaya related this story to me.

I do tend to be on the Mystical bent all my life.

  

Chandi Devi
