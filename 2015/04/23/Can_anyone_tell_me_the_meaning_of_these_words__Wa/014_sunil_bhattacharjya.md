Namaste Nagarajji,  
  

Ladies are generally respected in the Indian society, both in the North and the South. Around the Mahabharata period, Gonanda-II's father got killed and Gonanda-II was yet to be born. At that stage Lord Krishna gave the reign of Kashmir to Gonanda-II's mother and the Lord ruled out the objections saying that the women of Kashmir were amshas of Parvati. Such being the reverence for the women, it had been easy to deify the extra-ordinary ladies.  
  
I understand that for grama-devatas, there are other exceptions too and sometimes different Vedic and Tantric deities are also worshipped (including in their specifc colloquial names) in different areas.  
  

As you have studied the subject in depth you may be in a position to share your publications on this (if available in pdf).
