Sri Bhattacharjya ji,

  

I sent this info to her.

She says definitely: It was definitely "Nama Shanaka Na" or "Shana Kanna".

  

As per Sri Nagaraj Paturi's reply, it could have been changed in lexicution, without Jaya knowing, as she, herself, was not speaking.

  

She was NOT in charge of the situation. This Devi, whoever, took over and through her rage, which she was feeling but not expressing the whole time, this Devi expressed this loudly at Arunachala Mountain, which, as we all know, is Lord Shiva in form (as the story goes, and as is quite remarkable here)!

  

I am sending all responses to her, also.

  

Thank you all so far for this.

  

Chandi Devi
