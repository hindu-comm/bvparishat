Namaste Nagarajji,  
  

Your guess is as good as mine. At times some heroic ladies (after their demise) are deified in certain areas and they are worshipped as the guardian dieties of the respective areas (grama-devi). Many worship any of the 64 yoginis by taking her to be a sister or a daughter or the mother.  One can even worship the yogini as wife and in that case one is forbidden to marry a woman of flesh and blood. It is all a question of faith.
