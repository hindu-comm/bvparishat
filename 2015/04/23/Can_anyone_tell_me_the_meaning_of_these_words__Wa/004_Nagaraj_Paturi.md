Is it by any chance Nama(h) Sankara/(ya)?



 ----- Dr. I. Srinivasa Rao  





Very muchclose to possible.





Namas's'ankaraa(ya)



s' \>sh change is quite common from Sanskrit to colloquial Hindi.



namasshankaraa(ya)



With anaptyxis /svarabhakti with 'a' being inserted between 'n' and 'k' can change into namas'shanakaraaya.



Dutch 'to' is 'naar' and turns into aan in many contexts. The 'n'in this case marker might haveplayed a role and might have changed the 'raaya' part into 'naana'leading to namasshanakanaana



Or a less grammatical namas's'ankaraa could have changed with the same phonetic changes (1. Hindi s'>sh 2. anaptyxis/svarabhakti 3. raa \>naa 'naa' coming from Dutch 'naar') into namasshanakanaa.
