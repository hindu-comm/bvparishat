Sri Nagaraj Paturi,

  

This is quite interesting.

  

She is sure that what was spoken through her was : It was definitely "Nama Shanaka Na" or "Shana Kanna".

But the changes you speak of, lend some interesting results.

  

I have sent this information to Jaya herself.  

  

If this post will stay, you can read this.

  

I will post what her reply to this is also.

  

I also replied to Sri Bhattacharjya ji about the Devi protection and this place of Arunachala.

  

Thank you ,

  

Chandi Devi
