Dear Scholars,

I am overwhelmed with this idea. Since long it is in my thoughts .

I am even trying to stage Shakuntalam - an abridged version. I have already proposed the project to MGI authorities but budget cut by the Ministry has a bit lowered my enthusiasm.  

This idea of Valmiki Ramayana is appealing. Can I make use of your suggestions and your previous experience , please. In MRU also we face the same problems regarding Sanskrit.  

Thanks  

Malti
