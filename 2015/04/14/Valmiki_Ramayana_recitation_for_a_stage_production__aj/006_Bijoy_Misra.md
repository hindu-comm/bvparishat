Dear Murtyji and scholars,  
  

The participants are suggesting costumes. I was reluctant because the delivery  

may not be so fluent. I shall check after they memorize.  
  

There are many other scholar friends who have written to me earlier on Valmiki.  

Please write if anyone has tried dramatic rendering in recitation. My curiosity  

has been with the statement that Valmiki taught Lava and Kusha to sing it using  
instruments. Music would be nice, but that would need more collaboration.  
I see the text as a drama and my thinking is that the early bardic rendering could  
have been dramatic to draw attention. Since the story contains rasa, some sound  
effect could have been involved to create drama. So is the basis in my thinking.  

  

I would be grateful for any scholarly opinion or advice for the project.  
  

Best regards,  

Bijoy Misra
