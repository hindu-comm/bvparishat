Dear Bijoy Ji!

Glad to learn that your Ramayana recitation has been in progress. Yours is a very classic idea to think of having a dramatic recitation of The Ramayana.

  

Here I would like to illustrate a few of our efforts regarding the dramatic recitationthough not of a full length in my past circles during my 22 years stay in Visakhapatnam .

**1. Enacting Sita Rama Kalyana Event by a Team of Scholars :**

During my long stay there we used it was an annual event for 18 years by a team of the Senior most Sanskrit scholars and by us, a few younger scholars too, to enact Sita Rama kalyana episode right from Mithila Pravesa of Visvamitra with Rama and Lakshmana till the end of Sita and Rama taking the original slokas from the Ramayana reciting them with dramatic effect.

Later with the demise of Dr. Diwakarla Rama Murthy at his age of 84 who was the coordinator of this programme that attempt was stopped.

**2. BALA RAMAYANA Enacted:**

In my days of fresh youth I used to conduct a programme named "SISU PRABHAATAM" for children of age group between 3years to 12 years in the early hours between 5.00AM to 7.00 AM to teach them Sanskrit in a very lively atmosphere. As a part of that programme I used to train them to enact a few selections from Itihasas, Puranas and Kavyas in the week ends in the presence of their parents. That programme went successfully for six years in which nearly 200 children of our Residential colony used to take part.

During that time those children enacted the BALARAMAYANA thrice reciting the original slokas adding some dramatic effect.

These two instances are my good reminiscences to share with you in this context.

Best Regards,

**Dr. Rani Sadasiva Murty**
