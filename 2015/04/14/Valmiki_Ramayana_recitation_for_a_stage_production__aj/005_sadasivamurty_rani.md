Bijoy ji!

Sorry for misunderstanding them as children. As the time is nearing fast with only three practice sessions choice can also be confined to only a few scenes as enlisted by you.

If the situation needs more impact of it on the people it can be in dramatic costumes. Even scholars' attire is much honored by the viewers provided there is the tempo of the sequences properly managed.

Warm Regards,

**Dr. Rani Sadasiva Murty**
