Murtyji,  

The students are not children. They are regular adults.  

I cast them by matching their voice to the character as  

much I can. I would love if anyone has created a two-hour  

abridgement for a dramatic production.  

We have three practice sessions, April 19, April 25 and May 3.  

Situation abroad is very different. People have less time and  

not much respect for Sanskrit. We try a lonely journey.  

The students are enthusiastic which keeps my energy.  

Best regards,  

BM
