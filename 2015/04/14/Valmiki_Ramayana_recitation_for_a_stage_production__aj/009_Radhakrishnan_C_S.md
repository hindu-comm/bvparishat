Dear Scholars.

As an attempt to make Sanskrit dramas more stage-friendly and take it to people of all walks of life, I wrote the Sanskrit Drama "Paadukaa Pradaanam" in six Acts. It was staged during the International Yoga Conference held at Swami Vivekananda Yoga University, (S-VYASA), Bangalore, it was a big success thanks to the great direction of Dr.Saraswathi Mohan. The book has been published in 2012 by the Sanskrit Academy of Vivekananda Yoga University, Bangalore. It has transliteration and translation done by Dr.Saraswathi Mohan.

  

With regards,

Prof.C.S.Radhakrishnan
