Dear scholar friends,  
  

Happy Sakranti.  

Through my efforts in understanding Valmiki I am attempting to stage  

sections by dramatic recitation with a few students here. My question  

is if some efforts exist earlier in India. Please give me a link to any  

production you might know or any resource person who might have  

tried a dramatic rendering.  
  

I complete my second year of Ramayana reading and we are entering  

Panchavati. I might complete the full book in 2018 when I would like  

to stage a complete play excerpting from Valmiki. Kindly bless.  

  

Best regards,
