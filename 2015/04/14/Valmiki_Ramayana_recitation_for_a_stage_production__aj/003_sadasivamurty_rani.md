Always our performs of those ways were in civil traditional dresses (Dhoti and Uttariya and saree for female characters) and were not in dramatic costumes.

Your initial attempt as mentioned by you is will be a good beginning. Their performances can be solo performances. You can comfortably train them to stage by 9th May as said by you.

Here I have a few suggestions for a successful performance.

1. Let all children perform in Dhoti and Uttariya only without Dramatic Costumes. So even if it is necessary to enact multi-characters by the same individual it will be comfortable.

2. Your presentations can begin with Adikavya Avatarana Episode in which Valmiki, His Disciple Bharadhvaja, The Hunter and the Two birds (Total five Characters) . There two main slokas :

Ma nishada pratistham tvam agamah saasvatiissamaah.

Yat kraunchamithunad ekam avadhih kaamamohitam.

and

paadabaddho'aksharasama: tantriilayasamanvitah.

sokaartasya pravrtto me sloko bhavatu naanyathaa.

can be the main dialogue slokas. Other narrative slokas also can be added for a little effort. Valmiki's going to River Tamasa, The sports of Krauncha birds, Valmiki being attracted by the sports, Kirata's cruel attempt, The sorrow of Kraunchas, Valmiki's grief.. Upto this - all this can be a mime with a back ground recitation of the narrative slokas by some other one. Valmiki's reaction through the above sloka can be through the voice of the character. After the fall of the bird and Kirata thouse two can play the role of Brahma and Narada and encourage him to write Ramayana and they extol the sloka \_ Ma nishaada etc.,

3. The rest of the incidents enlisted by you also can be presented in a combined techniqueof Nepathya Gana by some one taking all the narrative slokas and the direct dialogues by the enacting children.

I am sure this will be a grand success. You have a good amount of time at hand to train them well.

Warm regards,
