Dear Dr. Murty,  

Good. Did they dress up as dramatic characters?  

How much practice was involved or did they learn by repeated productions?  

What was the duration?  

  

I have five students participating. I would get them act solo since they are not so fluent.  

By solo, they are expected to have a bit more freedom. I am going with the following scenes  
to have a sampling of different moods and explore Valmiki's characterization.  
  

1. Lakshmana - angry outburst to Rama to provoke him to fight back.  

2. Kaushalya - benediction to Rama (for his protection in exile)  

3. Dasaratha - narrating the curse on him (before dying)  

4. Bharata - narrating his dream to his friends  

5. Rama  -   narrating to Lakshmana justifying the trip further south (to Agastya)  
  

I plan each student to have ten minutes. The staging is on May 9.  

Earlier in the winter I tried a scene of Dasaratha, Kaikeyi and Siddhartha on  

Kaikeyi's insistence that Rama's exile must be lonely. It was informal reading.  

  

I would love to hear of other efforts.  
  

Best regards,  

Bijoy Misra
