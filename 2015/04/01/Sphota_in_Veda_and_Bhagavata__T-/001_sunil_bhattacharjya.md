Dear friends,  
  

For seeking Sphota in Veda, we have to remember that "paroksha" is what the Veda loves. That could mean that Sphota could be inherent in Veda, though not propounded openly. That is why it is said in the Mahabharata that one can understand the Veda best only after reading the puranas and the itihasas.  
  

However the sphota ca'nt be there in the Bhagavata purana, as Vedavyasa specifically composed it for consumption of all, including the scholars as well as the lay-persons.  

  

Regards,
