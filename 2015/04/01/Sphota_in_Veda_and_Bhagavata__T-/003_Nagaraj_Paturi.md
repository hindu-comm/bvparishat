धन्योस्मि.



All those who read this post are dhanyas, as such a fund of references for the availability of sphota inthe Veda, Bhagavata and other such sources can be provided only by aज्ञाननिधि like Prof. Korada.



I also agree with the unity of व्यकरणम्, आयुर्वेद and योग .



I made the posts :

on this topic, making this point.



But may I say that even in Panini, sphota is not directly mentioned. But समर्थः पदविधिः 2.2.2. is in fact an expression of centrality of
vAkyArtha only.



Hari, in VrittisamuddEs'a, explains the connection between vritti and vAkya , treats them as transformations of each other, and in several different verses such as

वाक्यॆ ऽपि नियता धर्माः कॆ चिद् वृत्तौ द्वयॊस् तथा /

तॆ त्व् अभॆदॆन सामर्थ्य- मात्र ऎवॊपवर्णिताः // वाक्य\_३,१४।३७ //

treatsvritti and vAkya as mutual alternatives and discusses sAmarthya in that connection.



Taking cue from this, we can say that 2.2.2 is not limited to vritti , but is an expression of, among other things, the vaiyAkaraNa dars'ana's idea that EkArthIbhAva is the nature of words and that EkArtha is vAkyArtha and thus nature of words is to be part of vAkyArtha-communication only.



Such an interpretation would reveal the inherent vAkya-generating ability of aShTAdhyAyi apart from its apparent pada-generating ability.



I discussed this interpretation with the greatvaiyākaraṇa “Vyakarana Vageesha” Vidwan Peri Suryanarayana Shastri garu and he agreed with such a possibility of interpretation.



Thanks again, Prof. Korada for all the enlightening andfulfilling references for sphoTa.
