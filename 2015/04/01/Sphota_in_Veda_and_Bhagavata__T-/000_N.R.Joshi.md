Dear Prof Korada,

SAdara praNaama.



(1)Your posting dated May 29, 2009. I am quoting you now, “In the available Veda (out of 1137 ShAkhAs) Sphota is not propounded and we have to believe the words of Rs’is, Yogins etc who handed down to us, --------through Yogipratyaksha.

Even though Sphota doctrine is not mentioned explicitly in Veda, we should believe it is there.



(2)Is this what you were saying in your book (Theory of Language, p 84), “Similarly Shankaracharya and others refuted sphota in accordance with the system they are associated with. Rather they can/do not refute the theory that is there in Veda, Bhagavata etc.

Could you kindly elaborate this issue please ? Is sphota doctrine mentioned in Bhagavata PuraNa?



Eager to learn from scholars of BVP, yours sincerely N. R. Joshi.
