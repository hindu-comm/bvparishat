नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

But may I say that even in Panini, sphota is not directly mentioned. But समर्थः पदविधिः 2.2.2. is in fact an expression of centrality of
vAkyArtha only.  

                                   
  -- Vidvan Nagaraja

  

What you are saying is simply the सिद्धान्त of Panini.

  

Thee are many such instances across अष्टाध्यायी ।

  

The following sentence in my posting was actually said by my (your) गुरुकल्प , श्री पेरि सूर्यनारायणशास्त्री at a seminar in 1989 -

  

For that matter , even Panini did not say anything about स्फोट - all we have is a सूत्रम् - अवङ् स्फोटायनस्य ।   

  

I stop short of any further discussion on this topic as it demands a separate thread , which we may take up after some time.

  

धन्यो’स्मि
