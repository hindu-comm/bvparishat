Namaste Dr Sadasivamurty Rani

  

Thank you for elaborating my query.  

  

I would love to read the paper you mentioned.  

  

\*\*\*\*

  
**"COMPUTATION OF ECLIPSES IN INDIAN ASTRONOMY"** authored by **Prof. K. Rama Subrahmanyam, IIT, Mumbai** in the **Samskrita Vijnana Vaibhavam**, the proceedings of a seminar on **Sanskrit-vis-avis Science** held in **Rashtriya Sanskrit Vidyapeetha, Tirupati** from **08-09-2001 to 10-09-2001** of which the coordinators were **Dr. Virupaksha Jaddipal and Dr. Rani Sadasiva Murty**. This articles gives us a wonderful information about the scientific aspects of the Eclipse as found in our ancient Indian Astronomical Texts. Our Ancient Indian Astronomers never considered RAHU or KETU as demons and they always spoke of them as the Ascending and Descending Nodes. They say that those two GRAHAS - RAHU and KETU are mere CHAAYA RUPA GRAHAS (SHADOW GRAHAS) anb can be seen only during the GRAHANAS. चक्षुषा दर्शनं राहोर्यत्तद् ग्रहणमुच्यते\| 
The other details can be had from the said article or from the source texts of that article.

Could you possibly scan the paper and send it me ?

  

Thanking you in advance

  

Best Rgds
