Respected Scholars Namaste !!

As you all are aware that the चन्द्रगृहणम् (Chnadra Grahanam) will be on coming Saturday (4/4/2015) and in this time we perform Japa, Dhyaana, Pooja etc and even we will not take any food in this time.

But I am curios to know that " Why Poojas, Japaas are performed in time of गृहण ? And why we will not take any food in the time of गृहण "? Is our Shastras are saying something about this?

Personally I believe in this but I don't know about any kinds of textual references on this.

I am herewith requesting scholars to enlighten me in this regard. 

  

                  धन्योSस्मि
