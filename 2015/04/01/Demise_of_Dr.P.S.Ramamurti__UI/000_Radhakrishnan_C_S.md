Dear Members,

Very sorry to inform you of the sad demise of Dr.P.S .Ramamurti, Secretary of Egmore. Sanskrit School, on 31 March 2015. He was such a dedicated Sanskrit lover and scholar that he organised nearly 600 recitation competitions on Bhagavadgita. He was a picture of perfection, dedication , humanism and above all , humility. The Sanskrit world has lost a great champion.

May his soul rest in peace.

Prof.Radhakrishnan
