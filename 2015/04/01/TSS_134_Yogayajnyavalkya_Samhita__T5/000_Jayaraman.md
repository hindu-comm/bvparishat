Dear friends  
  
I am searching for the digital/scanned version of the text Yogayajnyavalkya Samhita, Trivandrum Sanskrit Series publication. TSS 134. I would be grateful if anyone can kindly provide link.  
The [sanskritebooks.org](http://sanskritebooks.org) website has books only till TSS 111.So does [archives.org](http://archives.org).  
  
  
regards  
Jayaraman
