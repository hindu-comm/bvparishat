Hi,

  

Hello Everyone.

  

I am looking to read some nadi vigyan (nasal cycle of left/right breathing) and indications of any kind of health indications(like BP, diabetics, cancer, liver, kidney etc.)

I don't know if it exists, but heard some local Vaidhya(Ancient Practice Doctors) talk about it without authoritative source.

  

Your directions would be really helpful.

  

Best regards

Prabhat
