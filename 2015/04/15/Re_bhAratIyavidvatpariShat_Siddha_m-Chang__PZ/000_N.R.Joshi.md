Yavanas---



Northwest part of India (now in Pakistan) was in contact with the PersianEmpire. In the navy of Persia were Ionians and Carians from the westerncoast of modern day Turkey (ancient Anato lia). Persians called Ionians as Yonaa. From it Indians had Yavanas. In the ancient times many Greek tribes were in Ionia. Thanks NRJ

नमो विद्वद्भ्यः



यवनाः --



Historical questions are difficult to answer at a satisfactory level and one cannot claim that it is the सिद्धान्त -



यत्नेनानुमितो’प्यर्थः कुशलैरनुमातृभिः ।

अभियुक्ततरैः अन्यैः अन्यतैवोपपद्यते ॥ वाक्यपदीयम् , ब्रह्मकाण्डः



A thing is decided by the best logicians after putting in the best
efforts . Later some other better scholars may come and prove it otherwise .



(तर्काप्रतिष्ठानात् - ब्रह्मसूत्रम्)

In the present context the term यवन is used by Paini at a time , where there is possibility of Greeks entering India.



In बृहत्संहिता , वराहमिहिराचार्य says thus about यवनs -



म्लेच्छा हि यवनास्तेषु सम्यक् शास्त्रमिदं स्मृतम्। (शास्त्रम् प्रतिष्ठितम्)

ऋषिवत्ते’पि पूज्यन्ते किं पुनर् दैवविद् द्विजः ॥



भागवतम् --



किरातहूणान्ध्रपुलिन्दपुल्कषा अभीरकङ्का यवना खसादयः।

ये’न्ये च पापा यदुपाश्रपाश्रया शुध्यन्ति तस्मै प्रभविष्णवे नमः॥



भट्टोत्पलव्याख्या on बृहज्जातकम् --



’ मययवनमणित्थशक्तिपूर्वैः दिवसकरादिवत्सराः प्रदिष्टाः ’ - मयो मयनामा दानवः सूर्यलब्धवरप्रसादः , यवनाः म्लेच्छजातीयाः होराविद इति।



In ज्योतिषम् the term यवन / यवनाचार्य / यवनेश्वर is generally taken as referring to Yunan - Arab - Persian (Iran) and we have some words like अनफा , सुनफा , दुरधुरा (सुयोगाः) which are borrowed from Persian.



The names of week days are borrowed from Greek.
