Dear Dr Joshi,  

The measurements as you are referring are quantitative.  

The process is more conceptual. Two objects can have समता,  

same colors, same size, same look etc. But we see in literature  
समत्वं योग उच्यते.  

Spinoza and Bertrand Russell in the west analyze these from  

a scientific viewpoint. Indian literature is rich on the concepts,  

I have not read all. We are thankful to Dr Korada for his analytic  

posting.  

Thank you.  

Bijoy
