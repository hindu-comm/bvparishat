I have two points to make, but will make the second point in a further mail.



Itcannotbegrudgedorgainsaidthat, in general, Direct Evidence is not always available, and that, in its absence, Circumstantial Evidence (CE) may be accorded a place, as a pointer to the actual state of affairs. The latter (CE) is not expected to prove things, but can lead to or point towards some**highly probable** solution(s). It is quite clear that we are in that realm. But those who brush it aside can also be expected to be on equal, if not surer, grounds. Something like*vivAde'nvis"yate patram,tad-abhAve tu sAks"iNaH !*



Presently, the question to be examined is - what is more probable in our context? : Perforating leaves for the sake of some purpose like serving food, or perforating leaves of a manuscript/book ?



The difficulty is with*s'an'kunA *being in the **singular**, and
*sarvANi parNAni santRNNAni ,* being in the **plural**. In the case of a leaf for food, typically of *palAs'a* (plantain leaves brook no piercing), preparing even a single Big Leaf - one fit for meals, that is - will have to involve utilisation of numerous*s'an'ku*-s (plural). Let's call it the Meal Leaf.



In fact, the word*s'an'ku* can hardly refer to such a small linking piece (typically, much tinier than a matchstick) that is needed, and in fact, dozens of them are needed for the preparation of even a single Meal Leaf. Obviously, the "singularity" of the*s'an'ku* gets violated, when too many are being utilised. 



I do not think we can take recourse to the ruse of *jAtyeka-vacana* here. For, the singularity of the "Object of Comparison (*upameya*)" stands violated by that. The *upameya* here is *on'kAra; *its penetration of ALL speech is by its unity; onecannotthink of numerous little "oM-lets" doing the job! : for every leaf has to be fastened to its neighbouring leaves with some 3 or 4 pins! If that was intended indeed, nothing could prevent the text from using*on'kAraiH* (and*s'an'kubhiH*). This, then, is a case of a single, long enough *s'an'ku,* holding numerous - the *upanis"ad* says "all" - leaves. (And how many Meal Leaves make "all" leaves ? Ought we to say, just as many as were needed, and remain content ?)



Nor is it desirable to find another escape-route, now, by invoking the maxim,

*na hi dRs"TAnta-dArs"TAntikayos sarva-sAmyam ,*

especially when a more plausible alternative could be provided,and with less strain : after all,*the maxim of economy* is welcomed by all *:"kalpanA-lAghavam yatra tam paks"am rocayAmahe" !!* Applying the Ockham's Razor, to wit.



On the other hand, if it only is a question of several Meal Leaves kept fastened through a single, long*,s'an'ku, *the *dos"a* of boring a hole through a Meal Leaf - making it leaky thereby - can vitiate the propriety of so making it , as it ill fits a Meal Leaf that ought not to leak its contents ,which include liquids (especially perhaps in the ready, common, context of *saha-pan'kti-bhojana,* where many sit in a line. Considerations of *AcAra*).



Similar criteria will answer conjectural contrivances else than Meal Leaves.



As to a more viable alternative. It is in this *upanis"ad* that we come across a score of *vidyA-s.* (It is possible to take them as an *upa-laks"aNa* of even more *vidyA-s, perhaps,*but we can rest content with the**twenty**mentioned.) I am referring to the list that occurs**four times**in the*upanis"ad.* Refer***chAndogya upanis"ad***7.1.2, 7.1.4, 7.2.1, and 7.7.1 As I do not want to be prolix *(dhI-khedAyaiva vistaraH), *I may recount but two that possibly involve some kind of writing viz. *rAs'i-vidyA* (mathematics?) and *naks"atra-vidyA* (the science of astronomy); others may require it, too, but we are not sure. Unfortunately, we do not have fuller details of these *vidyA-s.* (We also have a list of various branches of knowledge in another, perhaps yet older, text viz***s'atapatha-brAhmaNa****11.5.6.8).*



Against the above details, there is a strong likelihood of taking the context of the so many leaves, all of them, to wit, to be of a book or manuscript, rather than just a bunch of leaves serving whatever purpose.



As we know, sound interpretations are made not on the basis of the mere dictionary sense:**

*vAkyAt prakaraNAd**arthAdaucityAd des'a-kAlataH /*

*s'abdArthAH pravibhajyante na rUpAd eva kevalAt //
(**vAkya**-**padIya** 2.316)*



Further, even if we assume -

**(a)** that Olivelle had not looked into Coomaraswamy 1936 (less likely he had not, for, the article was**simultaneously**published in *Etudes Traditionalles XLI (1936)*also, apart from *Vis'vabhAratI Quarterly* 1936 ; it has further been reprinted in Lipsey 1977 (*Selected Papers of Coomaraswamy)*(Princeton) (and, incidentally,recently tooin the journal *The Eye of the Heart* (2008, Issue 1)from La Trobe University);and so,

**(b)** that the idea occurred to him independently; 

we then have two persons, separated by over half a century who got**similar thoughts originally**- that the reference here is to some written material**rather than anything else.

And in case Olivelle had indeed seen Coomaraswamy 1936, he at least **concurred with**it.

And neither can, it must be averred, be accused of any chauvinistic approach, trying to accord, much less foist, unwarranted antiquity; both are careful scholars.

  

And while Coomaraswamy said of the passage that itaffords***very strong* evidence**for the contemporaneity of writing with the redaction of this Upanis"ad, Olivelle said it was***an important piece of* evidence**both**for writing in India** etc. ****



I do not think that the absence of demonstrative evidence should be too strongly insisted upon in such contexts of remote antiquity. Nor is it fair to swing to the opposite extreme - to claim that the Upanis"ad must be grouped under later Upanis"ad-s, and consigned to the end of the Common Era or much later.

  

In any case, all this churning is desirable.***gopatha-brAhmaNa***1.1.30 commends the method of interrogations and explorations leading to arriving at the correct sense :*pras'naiH prati-vacanais' ca yathArtham padam anuvicintya...*

*  
*

I hope I am not splitting hairs.

Kannan
