Hare Krishna.  
  
Dear sirs,  
I am looking for the source of verse supposed to be in Adi-varaha-purana:  
  
gaṅgā śataguṇā puṇyā māthure mama maṇḍale\|  
yamunā viśrutā devi! nātra kāryyā vicāraṇā\|\|  
  
As I do not have a searchable version of adi-varaha purana, I am not  
able to search it and thus if someone can help me with this.  
  
Thankyou,  
Damodara Das
