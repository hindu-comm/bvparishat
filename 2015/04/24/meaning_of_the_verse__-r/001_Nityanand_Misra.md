Your source appears to be dubious – it does not look like an authentic verse to me.

A very similar reading is inशिशुपालवधम्:उदयति विततोर्ध्वरश्मिरज्जावहिमरुचौ हिमधाम्नि याति चास्तम् (४.२०).

This reading appears to be incorrect, for the first half violates the Drutavilambita metre. A very similar reading for the first quarter is in शिशुपालवधम्: अचल एष भवा**नि**व राजते (४.२१).

So seems somebody took two verses fromMāghakāvya and then added something from somewhere else to prepare a hodgepodge with the aim of teaching prosody.कहीं की ईंट कहीं का रोड़ा भानुमती ने कुनबा जोड़ा.
