Namaste  
  

I was reading a text on yoga - योगयाज्ञ्यवल्क्य.  
  
देहमध्याद् गुदे गार्गि! गुदात् तत्रोरुमूलतः।  
ऊरुमूलात् तयोर्मध्ये तस्माज्जान्वोर्निरोधयेत्।  
**चितिमूले** ततः तस्मात् जङ्घयोर्मध्यमे तथा। 7.21-22  

(The context is - channelizing and holding prāṇa in these various marmasthānas)  

The translator gives the meaning of the word **चितिमूले** as - *in the base of the calves* (calf muscles of the two legs). When I referred to Vācaspatya, śabdakalpadruma and available Sanskrit-English dictionaries, I could not find any entry that said **चिति** is calf muscle or **चितिमूल** is the base of calf muscle.  
  

Or has this word been used in a etymological sense (यौगिकार्थः) - चीयते मांसादिकमत्र (a place in the body (like calf muscles) where मांस accumulates)?  
  

Kindly help by clarifying.  
  

regards  

Jayaraman
