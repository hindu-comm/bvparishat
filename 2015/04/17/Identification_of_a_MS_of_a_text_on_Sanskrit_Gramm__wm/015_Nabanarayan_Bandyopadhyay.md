Dear Deepro,

I have identified the grammatical text of the manuscript (in Bengali script) sent by you through dropbox. It is a .tiikaa entitled Vivara.nii ( on Kaaraka, 5th Paada) by (Autthasanika) Goyiichandra on Sa.mkhiptasaara Vyaakara.na by Kramadiishvara. The text with revised v.rtti by Jumaranandin and .tiikaa by Goyiichandra along with Bengali translation of ti'nanta and k.rdanta paadas is edited by Gurunaatha Vidyaanidhi Bha.t.taacaarya& published by Jaanakinaatha Kaavyatiirtha from Kolkata in Shaka 1833. The scanned printed portion of the beginning and the end part relevant to the given manuscript of the Kaaraka paada is attached herewith for perusal. Pl. note that the .tippa.nis written in the MSS are yet to be identified. Hope this information will help to some extent to you and the scholars interested in this MSS.

Best wishes,

Nabanarayan Bandyopadhyay
