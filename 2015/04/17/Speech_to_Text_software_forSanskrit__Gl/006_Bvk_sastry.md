Namaste Joshi ji and all  
  
Reference complete trail mail here  
  
1. It was very nice of you to bring up the vedic phonetics and IPA related in this discussion.  
  
2. As these deliberations relate to high end programming issues, Sanskrit computational linguistics , language technology and enterprise issues including doctoral studies at a premier institution, i am compelled to refrain from making further comments on this. Also further elaboration on this does not befit the frame of BVP group objectives.  
  
3. Closing , IT people are conversant with two words: help text and program code text.  
Help text comes handy for those familiar and user of code.  
  
Programming code is enterprise specific and confidential.  
  
Your questions border on seeking code in the discussions of help text.  
I am open for discussion on these Sanskrit language technology matters and my views (- developed over a period of many years, which some of the members on this are aware of). These need to be private before going public on forum.  
  
And these discussions are not ' open source/ free for all / shareware codes' please. There are involved issues of deeper technology and larger interests of language user community (- particularly vedic sanskrit and voice).  

  
Regards  
Bvk Sastry
