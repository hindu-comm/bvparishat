Dear Scholars,

A new attempt at answering a difficult question, by a reputed scholar namely Dr.A.K.Bag, Editor of IJHS:

  

"Early System of Naks. atras, Calendar and Antiquity  

of Vedic & Harappan Traditions"

  

The antiquity of these Rgvedic, Yajurvedic, BrāhmaNic and Vedānga-jyautis.a traditions may be found by comparing the old and new longitudes of naks.atras and fixed at 6500 BC, 5000 BC, 2500 BC and 1000 BC respectively after corrections due to visibility error.

  

Full paper is attached
