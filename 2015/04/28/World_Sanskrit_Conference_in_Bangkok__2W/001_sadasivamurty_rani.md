Dear Prof. Jay Soni Ji!

The way the organizers of the World Sanskrit Conference in Bangkok treat the aspirants to participate in the conference very much disappointing.

It was our general experience that whenever we applied to participate in any conference there were a series of follow up mails to the personal ids guiding the participants time to time regarding how one can have a comfortable access to the context.

  

But these organizers seem to have no concern for the participation of enthusiasts. Ever since I applied to participate in this conference there has been a long silence till date till the third bulletin has been released. The news of this third bulletin also we could get through Jay Soni ji through this BVP and not through the organizers. Thanks to Jay Soni ji and thanks to BVP also.

  

If this conference is intended only for a chosen group of people better to change the name of this conference accordingly instead of calling this WORLD SANSKRIT CONFERENCE.

regards,

**Dr. Rani Sadasiva Murty**
