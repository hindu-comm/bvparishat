Prof. Amarjiva Lochan!

Thanks for furnishing all the details of our previous correspondence. Thanks a lot for showing lot of concern in underscoring the mails between the WSC Secretariat and me.

But I request you to pay attention to the following sequence of correspondence.

1. On 15th June 2014 I received a communication mail for the first time inviting my application to participate.

2. On the same day I uploaded my details as presented by Prof. Amarjiva Lochan.

3. On 16th June 2014 I received the following acknowledgement letter.

-   [Sanskrit Studies Centre, Silpakorn University, Bangkok,
    Thailand](https://in-mg61.mail.yahoo.com/neo/launch?.rand=0sh9u7lfhsndp# "info@sanskrit-thailand.com") -   

-   16 Jun 2014

To  
-   Sadasiva Murty Rani

Dear Dr. (Mr.) Sadasiva Murty Rani,  
  
Thanks for submitting Registration Form. We will get back to you in due course of time.  
  
Yours Sincerely,  
16th WSC Secretariat,  
Bangkok, Thailand

This was the last mail I received from the organizers. No further mails I received so far. . I am surprised to see, in your present elaborated proof, your the then next mail (Dated Mon, 15 Sep 2014 00:12:38 +0700)asking me to resubmit my abstract which so far has not reached me ever since it had been mailed to me. Had I received it I would not have stretched this discussion to this extent.

  

Any how Amarjiva Lochan Ji! 

On this international platform I don't want to be made an object of discussion any further.

I wish the grand success of ensuing World Sanskrit Conference.

Before closing my present mail I would like to draw your attention to one fact::

I am not Dr. (Mrs) Rani Sadasiva Murty. (I am not female)  I am Dr. (Mr.) Rani Sadasiva Murty (I am male).

Already it has been in your records and even in your mail dated16-06-2014 I was addressed by you as : Dr. (Mr.) Rani Sadasiva Murty only. But in your latest mail I am often referred to by the pronoun 'her'. Hence I request to make note of this fact.

Warm regards,

**Dr. Rani Sadasiva Murty**
