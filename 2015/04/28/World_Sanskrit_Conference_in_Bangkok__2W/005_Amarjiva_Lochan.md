Dear All,

Namaste. I have been watching the interaction among eminent scholars on the GoogleGroups about the comment and casting aspersion on the 16th WSC, Bangkok. Before I reproduce our file of mail excahnge with most respected Prof Rana Sadasiva Murty(pasted below this mail), may I put some fact on this WSC?

We have sent personal **individual mail**(not a cc or combined email) to over 3893 scholars related to any discipline of Sanskrit Studies throughout the globe( including Prof Sadasivamurty). Till the extended submission date ended ( 30 January 2015), we have sent over 42,4012 email. **Prof Bijoy, we also had 16 email exchange with you, and NONE of our response was delayed in reply for more than 11 hours!**EACH AND EVERY MAIL IS REPLIED WHATEVER DIFFICULT IT WOULD LOOK( ***for example, when the Conference will be held?; is Bangkok in Thailand?; can I bring my entire family of 6 to attend it?; do you have the facility of nanny for taking care of my baby; is milkfood safe for my newborn child of 4 months? what type of car will receive us at the airport?, can I be converted to Be Hindu at the closing ceremony?; do you have the pleasure arrangement for the delegates? how is love life in Thailand in and around the venue?, can we have massage in our hotel room and how much to pay for each massage?, CAN you put my room next to the so-and-so female participant?, ENDLESS QUERIES! phew!!***) .IT WILL NOT BE UNNATURAL IF SOME OF US COLLAPSE BEFORE THE REAL HAPPENING OF THE CONFERENCE as Thai poeple are never used to take on such challenge/queries, are extreemly soft-spoken, and having the patience of Karna while putting the head of restive Parasurama in lap. They would bleed but never exhibit their suffering.

We received **1499 paper proposals,** out of which 821 were accepted by our conveners(conveners nominated out of the names suggested by R. Sk.Santhan, IASS, and the local Organisiing Committee). This figure is **the highest ever in the history of WSC** as per information given by those who have been attending the WSCs regularly for the past few decades. The number of countries represented are about 60, and covers all continents. With 4 people only, we have worked out 92 hours a day( collective hours put by our mail management team) in the apst 5 months. THIS IS ALSO GOING TO BE a FIRST-EVER WSC being held abroad where over 200 INDIANS ARE COMING TO ATTEND representing 27 states(**including some from Prof Sadasivamurty's University**). The complete list of participants and their papers is already in the website for the past one week. NOTHING IS HIDDEN. Please also note, for the first time(*though at the cost of our own suffering and peril causing 2 of our staff getting hospitalised*), we had a deadline to submit the abstract NOT ONE YEAR BEFORE THE actual happening of WSC, BUT ONLY 5 MONTHS BEFORE! This of course has given ample opportunity to scholars from weaker currency to plan to come. ***Over 124 young Sanskrit scholars from India (Nepal, Bhutan and Sri Lanka) and Southeast Asia have been encouraged to come by our some form of support which would prepare a new class of Sanskrit researchers for the future WSCs***. Some late submissions were also accommodated as per request of resepctive conveners till March 29. We also took care to support some eminent Sanskritists over age 80 (and
have never been to any overseas WSC)to come and bless the WSC. ****IS IT ALL INDICATOR OF the 16th WSC NOT BEING a WORLDWIDE CONFERENCE?****
IS IT A CONFERENCE COCOONED ONE WITH LIMITED PEOPLE AND CHOSEN FEW? There has been an official communication with ALL VICE CHANCELLORS of Sanskrit Universities( the next one happening on May 4) in India to see how this WSC is strengthened. It has been an OPEN, completely TRANSPARENT, free for all Sanskritists(whether they are member of IASS or not). *Respected Prof Rani Sadasiva Murty, we did not get any reponse from you to send an attachment file of your abstract in any form despite our reminder.*

We are going to miss you there in Bangkok, and I repent for that. Your coming to us would have made us stronger, IASS stronger.

**PS: Please do not forget to read our e-conversation pasted below my signature.**  
Yourscordially,

Amarjiva

That's why I told that they might have had a choice of invitations. What could have been their criteria in choosing the people? Soma Basu Ji! You had a choice to express your queries. But our applications have no reply at all. Those who could apologise you for so many times had not time to respond to our applications at least once to guide us what to do further. Hence I suggested in my previous mail to prefer a different name for this instead of calling it World Sanskrit Conference.

Of course I don't participate further in this chain if this extended still. But my intention in sharing my views here in this chain is just to express my disappointment.

**We couldn't even had an opportunity to know who are our official Indian representatives participating in this conference.**

I wish this conference a grand success.

Best Regards,

**Dr. Rani Sadasiva Murty**

**On the contrary, my experience is quite different. Whenever I had some queries, I communucated via email and pat came the reply from the desk of the organizers. That they are understaffed they themselves had apologised for so many times. That's great, I must say.**
