That's why I told that they might have had a choice of invitations. What could have been their criteria in choosing the people? Soma Basu Ji! You had a choice to express your queries. But our applications have no reply at all. Those who could apologise you for so many times had not time to respond to our applications at least once to guide us what to do further. Hence I suggested in my previous mail to prefer a different name for this instead of calling it World Sanskrit Conference.

Of course I don't participate further in this chain if this extended still. But my intention in sharing my views here in this chain is just to express my disappointment.

**We couldn't even had an opportunity to know who are our official Indian representatives participating in this conference.**

I wish this conference a grand success.

Best Regards,

**Dr. Rani Sadasiva Murty**
