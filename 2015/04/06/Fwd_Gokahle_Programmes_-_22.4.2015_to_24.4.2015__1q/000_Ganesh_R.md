Here is a cardinal invitation to all the members of **BVP** for a lecture series in memory of the great scholar MahaamahOpaadhyaya N.Ranganatha Sharma.  

This is a series of three day lectures that are going to be delivered by eminent scholars on the subjects in which Sri Ranganatha Sharma was highly proficient.

All the talks start at 6.30PM and the venue is Gokhale Institute of Public Affairs, (Opp. B M S College of Engineering) Bull temple Road, Bangalore.
