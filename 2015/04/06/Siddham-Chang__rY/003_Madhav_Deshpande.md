Dear Dr. Iyengar,

  

  Thanks for your message. Our knowledge of scripts before Aśoka is not quite satisfactory. Pāṇini's rules do refer to the word lipi, but we don't know what lipi he is referring to. Kātyāyana tells us that the formation yavanānī refers to the lipi of the Yavanas (= Greeks), but these grammarians do not show any direct awareness of the Brāhmī or Kharoṣṭhī scripts found in Aśokas inscriptions.

  To the best of my knowledge, the notion of the Buddha learning 18 scripts comes from the relatively late text of the Lalitavistara, a Sanskrit biography of the Buddha belonging to the Lokottaravāda sect of Buddhism. I don't have that text at hand at the moment, but there is a chapter of the Buddha, as a child, showing his knowledge of these 18 scripts to his teacher, and the text contains a list of these scripts.

  Elsewhere in Buddhist and Jain texts, there are references to 18 regional languages, rather than scripts, and these are probably based on the notion of the various Janapadas having distinct languages.
