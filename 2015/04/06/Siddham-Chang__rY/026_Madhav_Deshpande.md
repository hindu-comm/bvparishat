Dear Professor Iyengar,

  

  Thanks for your judicious summary of the discussion. All the cited sources need to be evaluated for their relative evidentiary value, and interpreted in their own specific historical context, and one needs to distinguish possibilities from probabilities, rather than adding them all up in an indistinguishable generic argument. I appreciate your specific evaluations of specific sources. Thanks once again.
