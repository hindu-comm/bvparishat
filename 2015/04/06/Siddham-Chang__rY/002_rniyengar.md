Dear Dr.Deshpande,

Glad to know that my upload was useful to you.

  

My interest in the article (published around 1927) was due to its reference to "lipi". I was wondering whether the attribution of learning "Lipi" by Buddha was a later addition or was a lipi in vogue around 600-500BC already. My curiosity increases since, the learned author refers to 18 lipis in his earlier publication (1911) on the sixtyfour Kalas, link to which I posted on BVP. If the Jain Samavayasutra knew 18 lipis (say in the beginning of CE), Buddha's childhood training in writing may not be an exaggeration. But this leads to a new question. Which are these 18 scripts, known at such an early period? From the book on 'Kalas' I could recognize in the Praakrt text; Brahmi, Kharoshthi and Damili = Tamil . Leaving aside the scripts for 'numerals' we are still left with more than ten scripts. Indologists might have already noted this and discussed the issue. I would appreciate it if some light can be thrown on this question.

kind regards

  

RN Iyengar
