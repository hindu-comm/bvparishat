Good comment. Anyhow, Panini never said यवन means Greek. He just said,  
the feminine form of यवन, would become यवनानी, when suffixing feminine  
sufix to the word यवन, and the वार्तिककार amends it as referring to  
the लिपि of यवन-s, that the form is used as यवनानी, and otherwise, the  
female member of यवन community would be called as यवनी. Whether the  
word यवन refers to Greeks or any other communities known to पाणिनि or  
at least to कात्यायन, who differentiated as the two forms generated  
one to referring to the लिपि and the other to the female member of the  
यवन commmunity.
