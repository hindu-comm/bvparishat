Dear Madhav,  
Why is that "yavanānī refers to the lipi of the Yavanas (= Greeks)"?  
In Mahabharata Bhagdatt, a ruler of Assam, is referred to as Yavan. As far as we know Assam, where Bhagdatt ruled, was never an abode of Greeks.  
  
Regards,  
-Shivraj

Dear Scholars,I came across a paper by  
Prof.A.Venkatsubbiah titled:  

  
This is about the Chinese book of the above name  
which the author of the paper identifies with Kaatantra. The  
author not only collects considerable amount of data, but  
also analyzes them to present a coherent picture of the  
intellectual exchanges that took place between China and  
India. For some of us with interest in historical  
development we get an idea of the education system in  
ancient India, including some amusing sidelight on the  
plight of teachers !
