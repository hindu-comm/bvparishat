all we can say is that even when attempts were being made to write down the Vedas, the tradition of reciters looked down on such attempts.




-Prof. Deshpande



लिखितपाठकः shows not 'attempts were being made to write down the Vedas' but Vedas were already written down and already some veda-reciters were reciting with the help of a written text. What is being looked down upon is not 'attempts' but actual reading out vedas from a written source.



Date of the verse gItI s'IghrI is the date by which, it can be said with certainty that the Vedas were already written down and reading out the Vedas from a written source was already in existence.
