Dear Shri Shivraj Singh,

  

  We are all dealing with the best likely interpretation of the data available to us. Kātyāyana's Vārttika (yavanāl lipyām) says that the formation yavanānī refers to the lipi of the Yavanas. Who are these Yavanas? Kātyāyana's Vārttikas give no further clue. References to Yavanas in the Mahābhāṣya of Patañjali cumulatively seem to refer to Yavanas as Indo-Greeks. One reference says that the Yavanas have conquered Sāketa (aruṇad yavanaḥ sāketam). This is generally seen as the march of Menander or one of the other Indo-Greek kings to this region. Other references are "tiṣṭhan mūtrayate yavanaḥ" and "śayānā bhuñjate yavanāḥ". Especially this second reference matches the iconographic description of the Greeks reclining and eating their meals. The last reference is to the peoples on the borders of the Aryavartta. Here Patañjali lumps Śakas and Yavanas together, both indicating the northwestern direction. This is the cumulative evidence that points to Yavanas as Indo-Greeks in the works of Kātyāyana and Patañjali. I am not giving exact textual references, as I am away from my books, but they can be easily traced Of course, the word Yavana then has extended meanings to other ethnicities, ultimately coming to refer to Muslims in the middle ages in languages like Marathi. Hope this explains what I mean.
