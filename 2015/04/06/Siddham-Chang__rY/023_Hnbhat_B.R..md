One more question on the mention of mura, and naraka, as both are  
depicted as demons, killed by Krishna. And so also Bhagadatta.  
  
Now, were Assamees considered as rakshasa-s or asura-s, as Bhagadatta  
was considered.?  
  
Coming to the history of writing, when Assamese script was invented  
and the tribal people, accepted a script for writing as early as  
Panini? Many of the Indian scripts, are later products and had folk  
literature in the ancient times and inscriptions when they have  
developed institution of kingdom.  
  
Is there any confirmation for accepting the Yvana Lipi refer to the  
Lipi used by Assamees?  
  
All the three mentioned are depicted as Asura-s in other Purana-s  
also. How far this history of Asura-s is reliable for accepting the  
history of writing in Assam? (The identification requires  
confirmation).
