I thank Professors Deshpande, Aklujkar and Kannan for their posts. Let me summarize my understanding so far as follows:

The list from Lalitavistara is very impressive, but it may be partly प्रशंसावाद, with 64 names!

  

To be on the safer side if we take 18 'lipis' of the Jain text as realistic, some of the names clearly refer to different regions (i.e.geographical). The "lipi" need not have been limited to what we call "script" (or alphabet). It appears to me 'lipi' included not only 'numerals' but also diagrams, sketches and paintings. In other words, 'lipi' stood for visual representation of 'ideas.' Of course, how 'bird calls' were represented by 'lipi' is a moot question.

  

Prof. Aklujkar's reference to number '18' as having become auspicious intrigues me. What might have been the basis for its auspiciousness?

Prof.Kannan's postulation of 'Early writing...in Upanishadic times' and Prof.Aklujkar's spirited response made me recall happily
काव्यशास्त्रविनोदेन कालोगच्छति धीमताम् \|\| . My initial post has served its purpose of making BVP scholars getting pro-active and working about our 'History'. But*s'an'kunA sarvANi parNAni santRNNAni* may not be referring to a manuscript or book, even if the possibility can not be denied. It may be just a bundle of leaves tied together for some other purpose like for serving food. I take it that Prof.Aklujakar implies that the means for arriving at history are as important if not more than the end result.As an aside, we can not say following the Bhagavata story of Rukmini sending a written message to Krishna, that writing was known during the Mahabharata times (whatevermillenniumit may be!)

  

I like to add the following speculations to the "Open File" on writing in ancient India.

  

1)Some seem to be thinking that 'script, writing, manuscript etc ' should have been part of ancient Vedic intellectual tradition as it is now. This is not demonstrable, nor essential to have been so on the face of a proud and successful oral tradition. श्रुति ->श्रौति relation demarcates this tradition in contrast with the much later ग्रंथ -> ग्रंथि relation (Sikh religion).

2) The verb लिखति appears in Tai.Sam. and in other texts, in the sense of drawing lines. Drawings were obviously known as evidenced in the different Vedic texts and of course the shulbasutras. we see that representation of concepts and thoughts (a whole lot of them in one go) in terms of sketches existed in Vedic times.Representation of sounds in terms of visual symbols and their standardization would have been required for record keeping. It is my guess that ''numerals" अंकलिपि
came first. In the Rgveda 10th book there is reference to cows marked on their ears with "ëight". सहस्रं मेददतो अष्टकर्ण्यः ....(10.62.7) . Here two numbers, 1000 and 8, are referred, but their uses are entirely different.सहस्रंis at best a count butअष्टis something to be seen! Even ifonewere to interpret the word as "ears looking like eight" the visual representation of the numeral eight is embedded in this hymn.

3\) Reference to Kaitubha as book in Paali gives me an idea. Let us look for पुस्तकम् , ग्रंथः etc . The first word appears too late, only in classical literature. Its etymology may be useful for further discussion, since in the first use stage, यौगिकार्थ would have been meant. The second word is directly connected with tying and with knots, (ग्रंथिं ग्रथ्नातु \|\| तै .सं )which in रूढिleads to ग्रंथः as books. Grammarians may have discussed this word already. In the context of Vedic literature the earliest use of this word in the sense of 'book'occurs in the अथर्ववेदपरिशिष्ट. 

(AVParis_31,10.5) gopathāt pāṇineyāya madhye nṝṇāṃ pramodinām/ hitārtham uddhṛto granthaḥ koṭihomas tu viśrutaḥ \|\|

  

(AVParis_49,4.8) lakṣaṇagranthā bhavanti/ caturādhyāyikā prātiśākhyaṃ pañcapaṭalikā dantyoṣṭhavidhir bṛhatsarvānukramaṇī ceti \|\| 

But AVP as available now, contains very ancient (e.g.शकधूम ) and also very late (c 300BC) information brought together in one place.

  

Best regards to all the discussers
