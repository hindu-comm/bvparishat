Let me again say that we don't clearly know who the word yavana refers to in the works of Pāṇini and Kātyāyana, but I have referred to the evidence from Patañjali's Mahābhāṣya that at least for his usage, we can be certain that he is referring to Indo-Greeks. Pāṇini's home town Śalātura is in the Swat Valley, very close to the region where Aśokan edicts in the Greek script are found. So there is a good chance that Pāṇini is familiar with the word yavana in the sense of Greek. That does not preclude the word being used to refer to other groups and individuals in other works like the Mahābhārata or later languages like Marathi.
