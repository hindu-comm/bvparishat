Dear Scholars,

I came across a paper by Prof.A.Venkatsubbiah titled:

This is about the Chinese book of the above name which the author of the paper identifies with Kaatantra. The author not only collects considerable amount of data, but also analyzes them to present a coherent picture of the intellectual exchanges that took place between China and India. For some of us with interest in historical development we get an idea of the education system in ancient India, including some amusing sidelight on the plight of teachers !

The paper may be of interest to some members on this forum. PFA the paper in full.

Thanks
