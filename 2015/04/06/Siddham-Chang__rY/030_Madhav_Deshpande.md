The dating of the Pāṇinīya Śikṣā is highly problematic. To begin with there are five versions of the versified Pāṇinīya Śikṣā, all of them critically edited by Manomohan Ghose, and then there is a prose version of Śikṣāsūtras attributed to Pāṇini, edited by Yudhishthir Mimamsak.
The prose version of the so-called Pāṇini-śikṣā-sūtras is almost identical with the Śikṣā-sūtras attributed to Āpiśali. A few of these prose sūtras, without any attribution to Pāṇini, are quoted in Patañjali's Mahābhāṣya, but they claim that the effort (prayatna) for vowels and sprirants (ūṣman) is different (vivṛta versus īṣadvivṛta).
If we accept this view, Pāṇini's sūtra "nājjhalau" has no purpose left.
This is a whole complicated argument discussed by several scholars in their published works, and I don't want to go into a long discussion of "nājjhalau" in an email. One thing that emerges from all this is that one cannot believe with any confidence that any version of the so-called Pāṇinīya Śikṣās, out of the six versions I have listed above, actually goes as far back as Pāṇini himself. 

  

The listing of likhitapāṭhakaḥ as one of the six pāṭhakādhamas is also found in the Sarvasammataśikṣā (verse 36), quoted by W. S. Allen in his book Phonetics in Ancient India (p. 16). Again the date of this Śikṣā is uncertain, and all we can say is that even when attempts were being made to write down the Vedas, the tradition of reciters looked down on such attempts.
