As to the evidence of early writing in India, right in Upanis"adic times, and in the age of a very early Upanis"ad at that, we have the evidence of the *Chandogya* *Upanis"ad* 2.23.3 *tadyathA s'an'kunA sarvANi parNAni santRNNAni , evam on'kAreNa sarvA vAk santRNNA ; on'kAra evedaM sarvam on'kAra evedaM sarvam.* What is referred to here is the way the pages of a manuscript were pierced (root *tRd*), which is indicative of the existence of literature in the form of books.

  

See the comment of Patrick Olivelle (1998:541) *The Early Upanis"ads : Annotated Text and Translation* on this.

"As all the leaves . . . pin:

the leaves here probably refer to the leaves of a manuscript. These manuscript leaves were made with a variety of materials, including palm leaves and birch bark. To bind the separate leaves together with a string, one or two holes were bored through them (Thieme 1968a, 17; Ickler 1973, 116; cf. Bohtlingk 1897a, 82). It is this image that the text is using to show how all of speech is penetrated by OM. If this interpretation is right, then it is **an important piece of evidence** both **for writing in India** and for the relative age of the final redaction of this Upanisad. For a similar image, see JU 1.10.3."

  

Olivelle, however, was not the first to make this "discovery." Over 60 years earlier, Ananda Kentish Coomaraswamy had noted this, possibly for the first time. See the last para of his article "Nirukta = Hermeneia", published in *Vis'va BhArati Quarterly, NS* II (1936).

  

Says Ananda Coomaraswamy:

"Incidentally, the *ChAndogya* passage cited above, "As all the leaves are pinned together by a spike (*yathA s'an'kunA sarvANi parNani santRNNani*)," affords very strong evidence for the contemporaneity of writing with the readaction of this Upanis"ad, for everyone who has seen a South Indian palm leaf manuscript of many leaves held together by a spike passed through one of the string-holds will recognize the aptness of the simile."

  

And now, going by the similarity in idea and expression, and the same circumspect manner of writing that obtains in Coomaraswamy's works all through, it is obvious that Olivelle 1998 is indebted to Coomaraswamy 1936 for the comment, though it is not admitted as such by him.
