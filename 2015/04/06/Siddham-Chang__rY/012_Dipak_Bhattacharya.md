Sankara's explanation does not refer to manuscript leaves  

तद् यथा शंकुना पर्णनालेन सर्वाणि पर्णानि पत्रावयवजातानि संतृण्णानि निविद्धानि व्याप्तानीत्यर्थः। After this the imagery looks like one of ओंकार containing every aspect of Brahman, not of piercing thru them. In that case after Sankara this should be expressive of ब्रहमणः सार्वत्रिकत्व. A clear reference from traditional interpretation could have contributed to clarification.  

Boehtlingk's ideas were based on his belief that the Braahma.nas could not have been orally composed. My idea against this was explained in 2008 (Introd. AVP II) and in 2014 (Paa.nini, his environment etc., RBU).  
It is relevant in this context that ;Srauta scholars that is ka.nthapaa.thins do not consider putting the Vedas in writing as preserving them. I was rebuked for this idea by one Ayyangar Vedapaa.thin who maintained that it is only the ka.n.thpaa.tha that counts in ;Srauta tradition. He discounted my efforts to bring out a critical edition of the AVP as contributing to the preservation of the Atharvaveda. However he praised that as a step to revive the oral tradition.  
I respect his views irrespective of I subscribe to that or not.
