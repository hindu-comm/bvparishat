Dear Madhav,  
Mahabharat has these verses:  
  
02,013.013a muraṃ ca narakaṃ caiva śāsti yo yavanādhipau  
02,013.014a bhagadatto mahārāja vṛddhas tava pituḥ sakhā  
  
02,023.017a sa tān api maheṣvāso vijitya bharatarṣabha  
02,023.017c tair eva sahitaḥ sarvaiḥ prāgjyotiṣam upādravat  
02,023.018a tatra rājā mahān āsīd bhagadatto viśāṃ pate  
  
King Bhagdatta of prāgjyotiṣam (Assam) is called a yavan.  
  
Is it possible that in Sanskrit works the word Yavan was also used to denote Indian tribes?  
  
How can we be sure Pāṇini is referring to Greeks?  
  
Best Wishes,  
Shivraj
