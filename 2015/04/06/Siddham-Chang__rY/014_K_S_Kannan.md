Dear Scholars,

  

Apropos Bhattacharya.  

  

If the question has had been primarily or essentially one of going by a "**traditional** interpretation", rather than one by some later/modern, alien, interpreters (possibly not imbued with the spirit of the tradition), here is something to consider.

  

The interpretation (of Olivelle 1998 as well as) of Coomaraswamy 1936 can be seen as vouchsafed as even more "traditional" - if one is forced to render that appellation - perhaps, by the following citation from

*jaiminIyopanis"ad*1.10.36,

which leaves one in no doubt whatsoever as to the interpretation of*santRNNA. *For, the textreads:

  

*yathA sUcyA palAs'Ani santRNNAni syuH ...*  

  

It is **only *piercing*** that can be meant here. No pin can be said to "pervade" numerous leaves - whether of a plant, or of a book.

  

The piercing is in order to "hold things together", to "bind them into a unity", so that the varied/disparate items "do not fall apart", and are duly "centered".

  

No sense of permeation (as spreading through) or enveloping or encompassing can be seen as making a good, much less better, sense, here.

  

We have thus explained one Vedic text by another Vedic, possibly even contemporaneous, text, plausibly analogical in expression and espousal.

  

This is also quite like the string that "holds together" various gems, precisely because of the *perforation*.

  

The analogy may look like lacking an "organic" connection or assimilative integration, yet the analogy has an equal, or equivalent, force and purport.
