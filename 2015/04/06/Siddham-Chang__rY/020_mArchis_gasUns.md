Namaste,

  

 I'm writing a book on Devanagari ten years by now. A few articles published on the history of the script in Russian. For those, who can read German the best book on Indian script, similar to what Cardona did with Paninian literature, is **Falk Harry. Schrift im alten Indien**. I can show the book to the interested scholars per email.
