Many, many thanks, Prof. Kannan. Frequently, one needs to study the historiography of an issue to judge if the history (or supposed history being passed on to us) bearing on that issue can be correct. It is not an easy job to explore such history of history. You have made an important contribution to its exploration.  
  
Let us not allow the discussion to be diverted into a discussion of whether Professor P. Olivelle knowingly hides his indebtedness to Coomaraswamy. Personally I do not think that he would do so. What we should concentrate on is other pieces of evidence which indicate, if not explicitly support, the existence of writing in early India, especially in pre-A;sokan India. I am inclined to believe that their collective weight, if not explicitness, would, one day, lead us to a very different reconstruction of history. I invite the members of this forum to be on the look-out and enable me to put the possibly useful pieces of evidence in my open file (of course, with proper acknowledgement).  
  
For starters, all the arguments I have seen so far for the absence of writing in pre-A;sokan India ultimately turn out to be absence-based arguments. They do not seriously pursue the possibility that the writing material could have been perishable, although a few research writings refer to this possibility.  
  
Brushing away of possible evidence through rationalization, rather than rationale, frequently by using current understanding of ancient history as if it were a fact, is also encountered in the available writings on the matter. Actually, we should be re-testing and, if necessary, re-constructing history when new pieces of evidence come up, not trying to fit the new pieces into a current construction, no matter how many respectable scholars support a particular construction.  
  
The similarity of the Pali word kai.tubha with the Arabic word kitaab that has been noted by some researchers should also be borne in mind, even if we may not be able to determine the direction of borrowing in the present state of our knowledge.  
  
I would also be interested in noting good/valid counter-considerations.
