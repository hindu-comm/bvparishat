An image of leaves arranged one atop another is arbitrary. Piercing may be horizontal thru everything without imagining leaf over leaf. That means saarvatrikatva.  
Our own imagination often defeats objectivity. But this is common and no offence is meant. Anyone is subject to his subjectivity. See Gonda (Triads in the Vedas) when he asks Dumezil to be free from influence of external structures and then himself claims that his ideas spring from the experience of the cosmic surrounding.
