Referring to Prof Korada recent posting.



Vriksha =tree. What is meant by Vrikshataa? Vrikshatva perhaps means treeness.



Ghana = dense. Ghanataa = density But what is meant by Ghanatva? I can measure Ghanataa of an object.

How to measure Ghanatva.



Go= cow. Gotva =cowness but could there be Gotaa like Vrikshataa? and what would be its meaning?



Sama = equal, Samataa = equality but could there by samatva = equalness. What is difference between samataa, saamya and samatva?



Thanks. N.R.Joshi
