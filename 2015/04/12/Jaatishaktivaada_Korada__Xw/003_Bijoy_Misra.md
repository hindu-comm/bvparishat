Dear Madhavji,  
  

I missed this posting earlier.  

The way I see the words are used, I would think that "tva" is used in more abstract sense,  

to denote a concept मनुष्यत्व, गोत्व, पशुत्व etc. The translation could be "the act of being (a man, a cow, an animal)"  

"Humanity" for मनुष्यत्व is a close translation. Words in English won't exist in all cases.  
  

"tA" on the other hand would be a property of a physical object. This can translate by adding "ness"  
  

I would think from a poetic use, "मधुरत्व" is a feeling, a neuter.
"मधुरता" a property - feminine.  
  

So मधुरत्व exists before a मधुर object comes to be. After the object is created, it has मधुरता  
  

So has been my understanding from literature. I may be reading too much into these.  

I am a physicist by training. I do see a cosmological slant between "tva" and "tA".  

  

Best regards,  

Bijoy
