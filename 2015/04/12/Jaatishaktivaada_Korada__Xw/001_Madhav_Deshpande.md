Dear Dr. Joshi,

  

  As far as the derivational meaning of words ending in -tva or -tā, they have exactly the same meaning. Kātyāyana's Vārttika (yasya hi guṇasya bhāvāt dravye śabdaniveśas tasyābhidhāne tva-talau) says that the endings -tva and tal (= tā) are added to a word to express that quality the presence of which in an object allows us to use that word to refer to that object. So vṛkṣatva and vṛkṣatā refer to that same quality the possession of which by an object allows us to use the word vṛkṣa to refer to it. Now in actual usage of Sanskrit, the frequencies of -tva, -tā and -ya formations (e.g. samatva, samatā and sāmya) differ from word to word, and they further change in frequency and even meaning in modern languages. But these formations are derivationally identical in meaning.
