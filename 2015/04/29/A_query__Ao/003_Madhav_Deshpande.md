Thanks Girish Jha and H. N. Bhat. What a wonderful verse. When I was a young student studying Sanskrit in Pune, I remember a senior teacher telling us that we, as young students, will not fully understand the true meaning of many Sanskrit verses, and that we will have to wait to reach an appropriate age and experience to really appreciate the wisdom of these verses. Having entered the 70th year of my life, I can now totally appreciate this verse.
