Thanks a lot Prof. Deshpande.  
  
I realize I had the wrong reading to begin with. The word in the Vārttika in the GRETIL edition, Chaukhambha edition (1988, Volume VI, ed. Pandit Dadhiram Sharma, p. 105), and your edition of Śaunakīyā Caturādhyāyikā is वाल (vāla) and not बाल (bāla)/बल (bala) as printed in the Bālamanoramā and Sañjīvinī editions I was referring. This also explains why I could not search it in the GRETIL edition, which lists this as  
  
(P_8,2.18) KA_III,398.16-23 Ro_V,382-383 {3/15}
vālamūlalaghvalamaḍgulīnām vā laḥ ram āpadyate iti vaktavyam .  
  
without marking it as a Vārttika (which are typeset in boldface in the GRETIL edition).
