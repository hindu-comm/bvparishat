Dear Dr. Nityananda Misra,

  

  The source of this Vārttika is Patañjali's Mahābhāṣya on P.8.2.18.
I have attached three pages from my edition of the Śaunakīya Caturādhyāyika, where its Sūtra 1.3.4 (Whitney's edn. no 1.66) gives a similar doctrine and the Caturādhyāyī-Bhāṣya gives a detailed discussion of other example. You will find the full Mahābhāṣya passage cited in my notes on p. 119. Best,
