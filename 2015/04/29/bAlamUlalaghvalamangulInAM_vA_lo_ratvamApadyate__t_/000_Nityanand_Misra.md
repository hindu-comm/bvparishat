Dear list members  
  
While explaining the Uṇādi Sūtra *laṅghibaṃhyornalopaśca* (US 1.30) in the *Siddhāntakaumudī*, Bhaṭṭoji Dīkṣita reads the following, which is marked as a Vārttika in the 1911 edition of the Bālamanoramā edited by S Chandrasekhara Sastrigal:  
  
बालमूललघ्वलमङ्गुलीनां वा लो रत्वमापद्यते  

bālamūlalaghvalamaṅgulīnāṃ vā lo ratvamāpadyate  
  

What is the source of this Vārttika? I could not locate it in the [GRETIL edition](http://gretil.sub.uni-goettingen.de/gretil/1_sanskr/6_sastra/1_gram/pmbhassu.htm) of the Mahābhāṣya. Is it in some other edition of the Mahābhāṣya or in an edition of the Kāśikā?  
  

Thanks, Nityānanda
