Dear all,

  

We are extremely shocked to inform the BVP members that our beloved colleague Dr Karunasindhu Das, former Professor of Sanskrit and Ex-Vice-chancellor, Rabindra Bharati University, Kolkata, passed away at the age of 68 on 16th April 2015.After expiry of his term of Vice-chancellorship, he joined the prestigious post of ICCR Tagore Chair Professor, Dhaka University, Bangladesh in 2012 and the last position held by him was Professor of Visva_Bharati since 08.07.2013.Professor Das had an outstanding contribution in the field of teaching and research in Sanscritic and Indological studies. His area of interest and specialization included Sanskrit Grammar, Indian philosophy of language, Indian literary criticism, Rabindranath Thakur: his literature and philosophy, etc. His achievements in all these areas are well acclaimed in the academic fraternity of Sanskrit and Indology.

  

An irreparable void in the Sanskrit and Indological world has been created by the sudden demise of Karunasindhu Das on 16^(th) April 2015. He was exceedingly loved by his respected teachers, dear students, research scholars, colleagues and a large section of socially conscious people around.  

  

Heartfelt condolences to the bereaved members of his family including his mother, wife, only son, only daughter, and others are expressed and it is prayed:

May his departed soul rest in heavenly peace!
