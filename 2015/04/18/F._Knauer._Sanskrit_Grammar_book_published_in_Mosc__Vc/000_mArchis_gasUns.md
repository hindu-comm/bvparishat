Namaste,

  

 Another book on which I've been working as an editor has been published. The plan is five more books in 2015 alone.

 Books outside India are expensive. And even more expensive it is to send them to India. As of January to send less than 1 kg of books to India costs 800 roubles, that's almost same amount in rupees.

 Knauer is a reprint of a book printed 100 years ago in Leipzig with my preface and biography, bibliography of Shrauta studies.

Autobiography in Russian <http://samskrtam.ru/friedrich-knauer/> I've received 100 copies and 14 are left. If postage is paid, I can send the 400 page volume worth 650 roubles for free. Let me know if additional info needed.



 Marcis, Krasnodar

  

P.S. If Frish had plenty of English inside, this book has none<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/bvparishat/UDYs1Mf0y7w>, but it's typography is outstanding and far beyond popular Sanskrit manuals printed nowadays.
