Namaste,Subramanyamji. Good development. This was highlighted in the meeting held at Surabharati last evening. Two Professors who have contributed their mite in bringing this about were facilitated too. The previous Government Order doing away with sanskrit altogether was rescinded thanks entirely to the resistance put up by sanskritists and sanskrit enthusiasts. Shows what sanskritists, though very few in number, can do when they organise themselves around a cause.
