It is a greatnews to all the Sanskrit lovers that Sanskrit is being introduced asSecond language. I hope many students will come forward to opt for Sanskrit as second language.

  

In fact I opted for Sanskrit as second language in stead of Telugu when I studied in Board High School, Attili, West Godavari Dist, from VI to SSLC(1953). The knowledge acquired those days is still alive in me. I hope many enthusiastic students are going to benefit due to the decision taken by our Telangana Government.
