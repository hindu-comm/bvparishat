Dear Mr. Nagaraj Paturi,

  

Thank you very much for kindly providing the Drgdrsyaviveka verse giving a definition of Pratibhasika Satta. 

  

Is there any formal definition of Pratibhasika Satta in the bhasyas of Adi Sankaracarya or prakaranagranthas written by him? (I say this because, according to some, the Drgdrsyaviveka is a work by Bharatitirtha)

  

Warm regards,

Sourin Dasgupta
