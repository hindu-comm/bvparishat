Sorry I meant Pratibhasika satta is Dream State  

Here are some views from a website  
<http://www.advaita.org.uk/discourses/definitions/paramartha.htm>  

**pAramArthika:** My existence is not dependent upon the mind in any way.

**prAtibhAsika:** The dream-tiger has absolutely no existence apart from the dreamer's mind, the dream-tiger is mental activity alone. Wherever the mind sees the dream-tiger, if it saw a dream-goat instead, the perception would be just as valid.

**vyAvahArika:** A pot does not exist unless there is mental activity superimposing it upon its material cause (i.e. clay). However, the pot's existence is not dependent upon any one mind and the same pot could be superimposed on the same clay by any mind. This means that it is possible to superimpose the pot on the clay because it has been designed that way for all minds, and not just for any one mind. It is only because the pot exists as a potential in awareness for all beings that it can be superimposed on clay by any being. Unlike prAtibhAsika satya, this superimposition is not arbitrary (i.e. you cannot superimpose a wallet on the clay instead of the pot, and if you do, it is no longer vyAvahArika, it is prAtibhAsika).

  

The History of the terms as to when they were first used in Advaita vedanta and how did the concept develop has not been answered
