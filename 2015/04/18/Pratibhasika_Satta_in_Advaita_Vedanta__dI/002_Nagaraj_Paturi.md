Please help me ascertain the source of the characterisation of pratibhasika objects in Advaita Vedanta as **"pratitikalamatra satta"**




-Vidwan Saurin Dasgupta

The following is from Drig Dris'ya Viveka:



**प्रतीतिकाल** **एवैते स्थिततत्वात् प्रातिभासिके।  
ण हि स्वप्नप्रबुद्धस्य पुनस्स्वप्ने स्थितिस्तयोः ॥३९॥**  
***  
***

*pratIti-kAle eva*, only at the time of appearance (of dream)*  
ete*, these two (viz. *jIva* and *jagat*)*  
sthita-tatvAt*, due to having existence*  
prAti-bhAsike*, are *prAtibhAsika  
na hi*, indeed not*  
svapna-pra-buddhasya*, one who is awake from dream*  
punaH-svapne*, again in dream*  
sthitiH-tayoH*, those two exist

  
These two (the *jagat* and *jIva*) are called *prAtibhAsika* (subjective) when they exist only during their appearance in dream. The two definitely do not continue to exist in dream for one who wakes from dream.



Also oblige by kindly providing other definition(s) of the term pratibhasika (if available) along with the source.



--Vidwan Saurin Dasgupta



Drig Dris'ya Viveka is one of the sources which gives you such a definition.
