Can it be inferred on the basis of the foregoing discussion that the seeds of the concept of pratibhasika satta in early Vedanta is to be found in the concept of the dream-state




-Vidwan Sudipta Munsi



Broadly yes. But with a caution: 'dream-state' here has two aspects : 1. the real dream-state of a human being 2. 'dream-state' as a metaphor, as an analogy to the perception of the jagattva of Brahman as real.
