Thanks Poojya V. Subrahmanianji for providing evidences for my confident claim:



"It can be shown with ample evidence that the ideas of the three sattAs were very much there in S'ankara's own works though not with those exact names".



Now, the interesting wording of the question would be" Who is sequentially/chronologically the first of the post-S'ankara Advaita-aachaaryas that extracted the ideas of the three sattas from S'ankara's works, organized them into a set of three,gave them the now well established three names vyaavhaarika, praatibhaasika and paaramaarthika?"
