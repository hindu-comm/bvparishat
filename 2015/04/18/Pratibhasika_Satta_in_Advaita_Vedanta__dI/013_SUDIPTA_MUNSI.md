Dear Scholars,

Can it be inferred on the basis of the foregoing discussion that the seeds of the concept of pratibhasika satta in early Vedanta is to be found in the concept of the dream-state and that it was only much later that the limited reality of the dream and kindred states were encapsulated in the technical term "pratibhasika"?

Sudipta Munsi,  
West Bengal.
