That the words vyavahAra, vyAvahArika and paramArtha have beenused by S'ankara in Brahma Sutra bhAshya itself was already mentioned by Vidwan V. Subrahmanianji in the thread :

But the word prAtibhAsika needs to be looked for. The word pratibhAsa has been used in VivekachUDAmaNi.



न हि प्रबुद्धः प्रतिभासदेहे

 देहोपयोगिन्यपि च प्रपञ्चे \|

करोत्यहन्तां ममतानिदन्तां

 किन्तु स्वयं तिष्ठति जागरेण \|\|४५५\|\|





PratItikAlamAtrasattA is not a different sattA. That is just a word used while describing prAtibhAsikasattA.



The word pratIti has also been used in connection with this idea invivEkachUDAmaNi :



प्रतीतिर्जीवजगतोः स्वप्नवद्भाति यावता \|

तावन्निरन्तरं विद्वन्स्वाध्यासापनयं कुरु \|\|२८५\|\|



It may be seen that the word adhyAsa has also been used in the same verse.



All this is about words only.



It can be shown with ample evidence that the ideas of the three sattAs were very much there in S'ankara's own works though not with those exact names.
