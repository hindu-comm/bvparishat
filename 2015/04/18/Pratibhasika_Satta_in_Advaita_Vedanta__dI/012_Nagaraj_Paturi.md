Now, the interesting wording of the question would be" Who is sequentially/chronologically the first of the post-S'ankara Advaita-aachaaryas that extracted the ideas of the three sattas from S'ankara's works, organized them into a set of three,gave them the now well established three names vyaavhaarika, praatibhaasika and paaramaarthika?"




----- my previous post in the thread.



I found the following at <https://adbhutam.wordpress.com/2010/02/17/paramarthika-vyavaharika-satyam/>:



Sri Sureshwaracharya concurs with the Acharya’s Bhashya!!

In his Taittiriya Upanishad Bhashya Vartika, while commenting, in verse form, the Bhashya of Bhagavatpada, for the mantra: ‘सत्यं च अनृतं च सत्यमभवत्’, the VArtikakAra says:

व्यावहारिकमेवात्र सत्यं स्यादधिकारतः । (सत्यं च व्यवहारविषयम्, अधिकारात्, Bhashya)

पारमार्थिकसत्यस्य वाक्यान्ते समुदीरणात् ॥ 407 (परमार्थसत्यम् bhashya)

\[The word satyam which occurs at the beginning of the sentence means empirical truth because of the context and also because of the fact that the absolute truth is spoken of at the end of the sentence.\]

It can be seen beyond doubt that Sri Sureshwaracharya unambiguously uses the words ‘pAramArthika satyam’ and ‘vyAvahArika satyam’ to comment upon Bhagavatpada’s words: ‘paramArthasatyam’ and ‘vyavahAra-vishayam’.

It becomes certain that Sri Sureshwaracharya has initiated the use of the two terms: ‘pAramArthika satyam’ and ‘vyAvahArika satyam’ that have been popularly used by the Advaita Acharyas of the Sampradaya initiated by Shankara Bhagavatpada.

This brings us upto the the two terms : vyaavahaarika and paaramaarthika.

Extracting of praatibhaaasika from Shankara's works, adding it to these two and forming the set of three seems to have happened later to Sureshwaracharya.
