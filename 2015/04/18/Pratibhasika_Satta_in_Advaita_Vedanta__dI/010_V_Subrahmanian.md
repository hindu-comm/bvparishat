Namaste  
  

Actually anyone can find out if a particular word/term/expression is indeed used in the prasthānatraya bhāṣya of Shankaracharya by using the 'anveṣaṇam' (search) facility of the 'advaitasharada' resource:  
[  
](http://advaitasharada.sringeri.net/php/login.php)<http://www.sringeri.net/2014/05/16/news/first-release-of-advaita-sharada-project.htm>  
  

The facility is very user-friendly. One can search from a particular bhāṣyam for a word or if the particular location is not known, one can use the 'sarvam' box.
