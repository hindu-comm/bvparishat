Dear Scholars,

  

Please help me ascertain the source of the characterisation of pratibhasika objects in Advaita Vedanta as **"pratitikalamatra satta"**.
Also oblige by kindly providing other definition(s) of the term pratibhasika (if available) along with the source.

  

With sincere namaskaras,

  

Sourin Dasgupta,

Kolkata
