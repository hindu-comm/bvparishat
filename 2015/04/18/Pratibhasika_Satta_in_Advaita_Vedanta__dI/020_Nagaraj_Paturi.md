While searching for the use of praatibhaasika satta in sources earlier to DDV (Drig Dris'ya Viveka) (oldest found by me), I came across an article by Lance E Nelson with bib details :



Nelson, Lance E. 1996. “Living Liberation in Sankara and Classical

Advaita: Sharing the Holy Waiting of God.” In *Living Liberation in Hindu*

*Thought*, edited by Andrew O. Fort and Patricia Y. Mumme, 17–62.

Albany, NY: State University of New York Press.



in which he quotes a verse :

अद्वैतमपि अनुभवामि करस्थबिल्वतुल्यम्

शरीरम् अहि निर्वलयानीव वीक्षे

एवं च जीवनमिव प्रतिभासमानम्

निःश्रेयसाधिगमनं च मम प्रसिद्धं



he mentions the reference as SS' 4.55, he expands SS' as



SankshepaSaririka *of Sarvajiiafman. *Edited and translated

by N. Veezhinathan. Madras: University of Madras, 1985.



I could not locate the verse in SankshepaSaririka *of Sarvajiiafman.* Can anyone help?



Thanks in advance.
