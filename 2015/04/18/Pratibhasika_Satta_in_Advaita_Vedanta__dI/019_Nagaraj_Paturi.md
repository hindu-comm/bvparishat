I am sorry. I was away teaching when the discussion in response to my post on two aspects of dream-state was going on.



Let me start with Dr. Ajitji's observation:

The History of the terms as to when they were first used in Advaita vedanta and how did the concept develop has not been answered.

Dr. Ajit, in my post on 21st April I quoted the well substantiated analysis that the terms Vyaavahaarika Sattaa and Paaramaarthika sattaa were first used by Sureshwaracharya. The words quoted by me from

<https://adbhutam.wordpress>.com/2010/02/17/paramarthika-vyavaharika-satyam

were :

"It can be seen beyond doubt that Sri Sureshwaracharya unambiguously uses the words ‘pAramArthika satyam’ and ‘vyAvahArika satyam’ to comment upon Bhagavatpada’s words: ‘paramArthasatyam’ and ‘vyavahAra-vishayam’."

I quoted the substantiation too.

But true, such a tracing of first use could not be completed, as of now,for the word 'praatibhaasika sattaa'.

Now , coming to Vidwan Sudipta Munsiji's post on 24th April, he asked "

"Can it be inferred on the basis of the foregoing discussion that the seeds of the concept of pratibhasika satta in early Vedanta is to be found in the concept of the dream-state?"

My response was :

Broadly yes. But with a caution: 'dream-state' here has two aspects : 1. the real dream-state of a human being 2. 'dream-state' as a metaphor, as an analogy to the perception of the jagattva of Brahman as real.

Let me elaborate : Upanishads repeatedly define Brahman through expressions such as "sarvam khalvidam bramha" that Jagat is Brahman. Paramaarthatah (on ultimate analysis), Bramhatva of Jagat is the truth. That is why that bramhatva of Jagat is 'paramaartha satyam' (S'ankara) or 'Paaramaarthika Satyam' (Sureshwara).

But day to day vyavahaara is not possible with viewing Jagat as Bramhan. Day today vyavahaara is possiblethrough viewing Brahman as Jagat only. ThisJagattva of Brahman is vyavahaaravishayam (S'anankara) or vyaavahaarika satyam (Sureshwara).

That this Jagattva of Bramhan is for a day to day vyavahaara purpose only but that paramaarthatah (ultimately) Brahmatva of Jagat only stands is not realized by the viewer all the time. This is due to a dream-state-like disposition of the viewer. Just as in a dream, the viewed (Jagat or Jagattva of Brahman)is taken as true all through thevyavahaara time. This kind of viewing is called pratibhaasa and the truth ofJagatduring this disposition is called praatibhaasika sattaa.
Here, it may be seen that the word dream-state is brought as an analogy to thesituation ofviewer's taking Jagattva of Brahman as real.

But apart from this, differentUpanishads including Mandukyopanishad discuss four different sates of a Jiva including dream-state (svapnaavasthaa) itselfof an individual directly.
