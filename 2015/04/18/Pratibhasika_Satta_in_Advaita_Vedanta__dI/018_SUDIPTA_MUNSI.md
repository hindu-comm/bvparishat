Dear Gargeshwariji,

  

This much I know. For this, I need not read an elementary book on Advaita Vedanta. I just missed the spirit of Nagaraj Paturiji's statement at a first reading that he distinguished between an original dream and the philosophical thought underlying the dream-state example, which became clear to me after a second thought.
