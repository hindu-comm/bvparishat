Dear Mr. Subrahmanian,

  

Thanks for your detailed reply.

  

However, I think my question was a bit misunderstood, since I sought for**a *formal definition* (laksana) of pratibhasika satta and *the source* thereof. My question with regard to 'pratitikalamatra satta' concerned the source of this statement.**
