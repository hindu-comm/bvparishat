Dear scholars

There have been some discussions in thisd forum, about the names and forms of the 64 Kalaas (Arts& Sciences) mentioned in ancient texts. To help young students who may be interested in the details, I have uploaded a published dissertation (Pre-Ph.D) of the well known Vedic scholar from Mysore Dr.A.Venkatasubbiah. What I like with the works of this yester year scholar is the meticulousness with which he approaches his subject.

  

<https://www.scribd.com/doc/260692963/Kalaas-Dissertation-of-Dr-A-Venkatasubbiah-1911>  

  

If there is any difficulty in reading or downloading the book, please let me know. I have two questions in this connection.

1\) It is mentioned in one place that the classification into 64, is based on the similar division of the Rigveda into 64 parts.

This is new to me. I know about the Octal (eight part) division. Please let me know about the 64 part arrangement of RV.

2\) On P.70 of the book a journal by name "Bhautika-kala-nidhi" edited by B.Suryanarayana Rao and printed in Madras is mentioned.

Does anyone know whether any old issues of this Magazine are surviving?

  

Thanks

RN Iyengar
