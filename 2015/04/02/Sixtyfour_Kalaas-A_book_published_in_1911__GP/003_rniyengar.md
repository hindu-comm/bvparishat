Dear Dr.Ramanujan,

Division of RV into 8x8=64 chapters had escaped my attention. Thanks for your clarification about RV structure. Can you provide a link to the lakshaNa-grantha you have mentioned.

In the RV text I am having the adhyaya numbers are shown but the Shaunaka-anukramaNi at the end gives only the number of the Vargas,

  

I was delighted to read about your contributions in the Hindu. Congratulations. May your tribe increase.

  

best regards

RN Iyengar
