नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

ब्रह्ममुहूर्त and other issues --

  

The day is divided into eight यामs - each consisting of three hours .

  

Night is called त्रियामा , i e nine hours (त्रियामा क्षणदा क्षपा - अमरः) .

  

It is not advisable to go to bed immediately after meal --

  

भुक्तोपविशः तुन्दं हि शयानस्य तु पुष्टता ।

आयुश्चङ्क्रममाणस्य मृत्युर्धावति धावतः ।।

  

भुक्त्वा शतपदं गच्छेत् शनैस्तेन तु जायते ।

अन्नसंघातशैथिल्यं ग्रीवाजानुकटीसुखम् । -- आयुर्वेदः  
  

After meal -- sitting would cause increased belly , sleeping would cause obesity , walking slowly (stroll) increases longevity and running would cause early death .

  

One should walk slowly for hundred feet after meal . By that the mass of food taken gets settled and there will be comfort in the neck, knees and waist.

  

It is advisable to have a gap of two hours between meal and sleep , especially for those who consume milk at night .

  

So , depending on age ( a person in यौवनम् , i e between 16 - 50 requires roughly six hours sleep) and ऋतु (summer etc) one may choose the time to go to bed .

  

On an average it can be four 'o' clock in the early hours we may take as ब्रह्ममुहूर्त --

  

ब्राह्मे मुहूर्ते बुद्ध्येत धर्फ़्मार्थौ चानुचिन्तयेत् ।

कायक्लेशांश्च तन्मूलान् वेदतत्त्वार्थमेव च ॥

  

उत्थायावश्यकं कृत्वा कृतशौचः समाहितः।

पूर्वां सन्ध्यां जपन् तिष्ठेत् स्वकाले चापरां चिरम् ॥ मनुसृतिः , 4 - 92,93

  

अथाचारान् प्रवक्ष्यामि .... उत्थाय पश्चिमे यामे शान्तमनसः विनिद्रः , सति विरोधे तत् त्यक्त्वा , नो चेत् तत्र संस्थितः समौ प्राणापानौ धृत्वा ....

                                  
-- गौतमाचारसूत्रम् ।

  

So , depending on age , health and season one should get up during the last याम , think अर्थ and काम , the difficulties caused by them and वेदान्त ।

  

Having woken up, one should attend nature's calls ( these are called वेगs - चरकम् enumerates fourteen वेगs and humans , compared with animals , frequently fall ill due वेगसन्धारणा - holding back वेगs , according to आयुर्वेद, causes most of the diseases -- वेगसन्धारणम् अनारोग्यकराणाम् - चरकसूत्रम्) , take bath , do योगाभ्यास (प्राणायाम, ध्यान etc is said by the term समाहित = having समाधि) , and perform 
प्रातःसन्ध्या and latter सायंसन्ध्या ।            

                                   
         

There is no any restriction to wake up before ब्रह्ममुहूर्त - in fact
some sages used to wake up at the first crow of a cock (roughly three o clock ) in the early hours.

  

If the body allows one may wake up earlier and most of the old people cannot sleep after the first cock crow . Also due to मेहदोष \|

  

I was a cultivator for twenty one years and had had livestock too ( wet land coconut orchard ,cows and she buffaloes ) .

  

It is not advisable to disturb the sleep of animals -

  

आहारनिद्राभयमैथुनानि सामान्यमेतत् पशुभिर्नराणाम्

  

In India people have the habit of having a nap ( in fact people in at least twenty tropical countries do have a nap) - after lunch . It may be okay during summer but not advisable during winter and rainy season - why ? there will be दोषप्रकोप (वातपित्तकफानां साम्याभावः -- यथा सांख्ये सत्त्वरजस्तमोगुणाणां साम्यम् इष्यते तथैव अत्रापि)

  

Finally , one may plan a six hour sleep , but not too early as eight and may wake up DURING ब्रह्ममुहूर्त । One can start the work related to cultivation / agriculture after five in the morning . The rest according to the circumstances.

  

I / we have been following these नियमs for long so that there will not be serious health problems. First it is the mind and latter body - मनः शरीरं च अधिष्ठानम् - सुश्रुतः।

  

धन्यो’स्मि
