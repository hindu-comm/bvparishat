Hare Krishna.  
Respected scholars,  
  
Recently I met one Madhva scholar who quoted a verse most probably  
from Mahabharat (as per his memory) but did not remember its location.  
Following is the verse:  
  
pañca-pañca ūṣa-kālaḥ  
sapta-pañca aruṇodayaḥ  
aṣṭa-pañca bhavet-prātaḥ  
śeṣaḥ sūryodayaḥ smṛtaḥ  
  
This was regarding deciding time for brahma-muhurta, arunodaya,  
pratah-kala in relation to suryodaya (sunrise). If someone can spot  
this it will be very helpful. I did try in GRETIL's mahabharata but  
could not find it.  
  
Also there can be a discussion on the kala-nirnaya of these times as  
some say it is 1 hour 36 minutes before sunrise that brahma-muhurta  
starts while some say it is 5-ghati or 2 hours before sunrise, some  
say it is 14th muhurta after sunset.  
  
Also any other references for the same purpose are welcome. Basically  
I am looking for some type of references for recommended time to  
waking up and morning duties thereon mentioned in puranas,  
Mahabharata, Vedas, or dharma-sastras. Brahma-muhurta is the agreed  
upon time by all, but another question arises that is there a  
restriction to wake up before brahma-muhurta? Because we sleep early  
(by 8pm) so it is natural for us to wake up before brahma-muhurta. But  
some ayurvedic doctors recommend us not to do so.  
  
Also as we are trying to live as per old village tradition, we want to  
implement practice to evacuate in the fields way away from our houses.  
But if we wake up early (even in brahma-muhurta) and immediately start  
to go for evacuation it is too dark especially in dark fortnights. I  
heard that it was a general practice in ancient India that people woke  
up early and waited till there was a little light and then went for  
daily duties till taking bath in a river then chanted sandhya. I did  
read in History of dharmasastra (P V Kane) but there is no clear  
direction to this although many references. If someone can help in  
this regard it will be helpful.  
  
Thankyou,  
Damodara Das
