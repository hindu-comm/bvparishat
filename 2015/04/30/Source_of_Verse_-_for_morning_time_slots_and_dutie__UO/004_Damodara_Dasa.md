Hare Krishna.  
  
I would like to thank Dr.Subrahmanyam Korada for this nice  
presentation about dinacarya.  
  
I would request, if possible, members can discuss in more detail the  
daily regime or schedule of different brahmana and other varnas of  
ancient India - even if they have it from their childhood experience.  
Also supporting with sruti, smrti, purana, etc. is always very good.  
  
we are in a process to arrange our schedule according to what it used  
to be previously in villages - and we practically find that people  
with different works need different schedules (some things are of  
course in common). we are specifically trying to figure out:  
1. when they used to wake up (even before brahma-muhurta or not)  
2. Did they go to evacuate immediately after waking up, in dark and  
then take bath or did they wait till there is some little light? we  
are finding difficult to implement going out, at least 300 meters from  
house, to evacuate if it is dark. It is possible in little light.  
3. what were the schedules of their meals - in all different varnas?  
Did they eat in night also? Did they sleep in night soon after eating  
(not sparing 2 hours)?  
  
Moreover my one question is that brahma-muhurta is meant for spiritual  
activities. So one needs to be ready for spiritual activities by the  
time brahma-muhurta arrives. waking up in brahma-muhurta makes one to  
spoil this muhurta in activities like evacuating, bathing, etc. So  
either waking up about 45 minutes before brahma-muhurta or taking bath  
after doing smarana, chanting Lord's Names, etc. in brahma-muhurta  
seems logical. But this is my logic only. I want to discuss this also.  
  
Thankyou,  
Damodara Das
