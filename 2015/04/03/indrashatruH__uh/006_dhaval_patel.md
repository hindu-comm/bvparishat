\>  
\> But that there was a difference between tatpuruṣa and bahuvrīhi is clearly given in the [1.6.3.10](http://1.6.3.10): अथ यदब्रवीदिन्द्रशत्रुर्वर्धस्वेति। तस्मादु हैनमिन्द्र एव जघानाथ यद्धि शश्वदवक्ष्यदिन्द्रस्य शत्रुर्वर्धस्वेति शश्वदु ह स एवेन्द्रमहनिष्यत्।

Comment in response to query 3 clarifies that the context needed it to be a slayer of indra and not merely an enemy. So justification for preferring yoga is there as per demand of prakaraNa. Thanks

\>\> Q2. If the words are so powerful as to change the meaning based on vowels, what would happen to the word वर्धस्व? Would it not be superfluous?  
\>  
\>  
\> It is not here, as कैयट shows in his example while addressing why इन्द्रशत्रु is not in the vocative - राजा भव युध्यस्व = (become a king \[and\] fight). Similarly, इन्द्रशत्रुर्भव वर्धस्व = (become इन्द्रशत्रु \[and\] grow).  
\>  
\> I may also add that Bhāgavatam 6.9.11 has the vocative form इन्द्रशत्रो:  
\> हतपुत्रस्ततस्त्वष्टा जुहावेन्द्राय शत्रवे। इन्द्रशत्रो विवर्धस्व मा चिरं जहि विद्विषम्॥  
\> So as per Bhāgavata's account तवष्टा said इन्द्रशत्रो विवर्धस्व = (O इन्द्रशत्रु, grow well) in which case the question of superfluity of विवर्धस्व does not arise.

Reference to SB has given the solution. The vardhasva word had its effect on vRtra but not in glory but in size..  
Enggeling's ttanslation of the next verse is  
11. And because he (Tvashtri) said, ‘Grow thou!' therefore he (Vritra) grew an arrow's range sideways and an arrow's range forward: he forced back both the western ocean and the eastern one; and in pro portion as he extended did he devour the food.

\>\> Q3. As the prakaraNa is of vRtra doing a yajJa to defeat indra, wouldn't it be against the context to derive alternate meaning?  
\>  
\> Minor correction - It is not वृत्र performing the यज्ञ here but rather तवष्टा. वृत्र is borne out of the यज्ञ.  
\> To answer your question, on the contrary, it is as per the context. तवष्टा wants somebody who can slay Indra, and is not merely the enemy of Indra. Hence the alternate meaning fits the context too, in addition to conforming with Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 1.6.3.10 and Joshi and Roodbergen's logic that 'relation of being an enemy is (usually) reciprocal.'  
\>  
\> The attached translation by Joshi and Roodbergen throws more light on the topic, including the nominative versus vocative form.

thanks for correction. This explains the question.
