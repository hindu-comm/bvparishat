Dear Sanskrit friends,  
  

Greetings from Boston. I wanted to thank all who participated in my query  

on performing Valmiki's text as a play. As I said I am experimenting with  

five solo performances for Lakshmana, Kaushalya, Bharata, Dasaratha  

and Rama as a start-up.  Each segment takes a particular episode.  

The program is May 9.  

  

In reading the book, I am in Panchavati now and Surpanakha just entered  

the story. I have two questions for the scholars.  
  

1. How does one interpret a राक्षस? Valmiki seems to distinguish  

  Surpankha and Khara from Viradha who he characterised as a cannibal,  
 पुरुषाद. Hee uses the phrase of रुधिरं पास्यामि liberally in both cases.  
  

2. Is there any anthropologic study through Valmiki's narrative?  
  

Best regards,  

Bijoy Misra
