Is there any anthropologic study through Valmiki's narrative?



-----------Does this mean

1\. is there a study that meticulously distinguishes the features of one human-like creature of Ramayanafrom that of the other ?



or



2\. Is there a study that identifies the human-like creatures with the real empirically verifiable human or human-like beings from contemporary, historical or prehistoric times?



#2was a fascination for the earlywestern educated Indian scholars. Their hasty and irrationalconclusions of such connections lead to many political consequences which are still haunting India.



#1 was done to an extentby literary scholars andnot by anthropologists.
