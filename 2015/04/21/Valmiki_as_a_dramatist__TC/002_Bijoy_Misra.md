Dear Nagarajji,  
  

Until virādha appears, the story can be rationalized to the current times.  

Through virādha and then with rākṣasa, Vālmīki goes into a description  

where violence is quickly initiated. He either imagines or has heard of  

human-like characters who are very protective of their land and do not  
appreciate intruders. daṇḍaka perhaps had the reputation of dense  

forestry where such population lived. Exile to daṇḍaka was possibly  

meant as a torture to confront with such a population.  
  

Anthropologically we hear that tribes are existing in Africa and Far East  

who consider drinking blood as a treat. I do not know medicinal or  

hygienic value of such exercise. But this could be part of habitat where  

one eats available food to survive. I have heard that primitive tribes do exist  
in Andamans and there could be reason to believe that Vālmīki had heard  

of them. There are statements about magic tricks which also can be  

rationalized.  
  

Poets imagine. We host every year an India Poetry Reading at Harvard  

in May. This would be our nineteenth year. Vālmīki as a poet has  

survived and his thoughts have shaped a culture. So my question is  

if we can map his creativity. Talking about the Poetry event at Harvard  

I am attaching the flyer. The topic is "Identity." You can join if you  

are in the area. Poems in any language are welcome. The date is  

Sunday, May 10. These are small fun events we do around here.  
  

Best regards,  

Bijoy Misra
