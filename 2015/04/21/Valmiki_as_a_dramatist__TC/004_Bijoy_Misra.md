Continuing further, Aztecs in the Americas are known to offer human hearts  

as an offering to their deity. Killing a human being apparently was not as  

bad as it is viewed today. Some such story might have reached Valmiki  

or he might have knowledge that "forest people" maintain their own  

cosmology like we see among "faiths" today. So I brought up the word  

"anthropology." I have to read further to understand Valmiki's view.  

Please advise if social analysis has been done by Indian scholars who  

are familiar with the subcontinent.
