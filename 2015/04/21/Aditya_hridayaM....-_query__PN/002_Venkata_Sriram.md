Namaste,

  

I am no "Dr" sir. Ramayana is my daily recital poem and I study the commentary "bhushana" of shri.govindaraja. Shri.Govindaraja, like any other srivaiSNava scholar, feels that this hymn on Sun is not a part of original rAmAyaNa and says that the oldest commentators on rAmAyaNa shri.udAli varadaraja was too of the same opinion.

  

So, I was curious to know about the authenticity of this hymn whether it was actually vAlmiki's composition or of somebody else.

  

Nevertheless, I have great respect and devotion towards this hymn.

  

regs,

sriram
