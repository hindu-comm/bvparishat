Namaste,

  

I have heard some scholars stating that Aditya hridayaM in rAmAyaNa was of later origin and was not a part of rAmAyaNa. Shri.Govidaraja, too, was of the same opinion. 

  

I would like to know whether any studies have been carried so far regarding the "arvAchInatva" of Aditya hridayaM.

  

bhavadIyaH,

sriram
