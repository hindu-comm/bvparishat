There are many books in Marathi,Gujarati,English etc. on the Dates of different incidents in the Ramayana and the Mahabharata,based on astronomical data found in those Two National Epics.Many scholars have tried their hands at these.He must have read at least some of them and some doubts have arisen in his mind.It is better if he mentions about his reading any of these-as rightly suggested by Shri Ajit ji.

  

Best luck and regards.
