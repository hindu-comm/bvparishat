The person who enquired this mentioned Manu 2-101 to 2-103 and said only two sandhyavandanams praatassandhyaa and saayam sandhyaa are mentioned there.



At another place I saw someone mentioning that



1\. Second pras'na, Second Anuvaaka of Thaittiria AaraNyaka (Yajur Veda)



2. Verses 15 & 16 of Ishvashya upanishad of Shukla Yajurveda



3. Chandogya upanisad (Chapter 2 Section ix)



also talk about praatassandhyaa and saayam sandhyaa only.



But in Skandapurana's Kaas'eekhanda in the 13th Chapter, The wife of a Dikshita reminds him of his maadhyaanhikee kriyaa.



In the fifteenth century Telugu translation of this book, the highly celebrated Telugu poet Srinatha mentions madhyaanha sandhyaa as part of the details of the maadhyaahnee kriyaa.



This person was asking me how madhyanha sandhyaa entered the fifteenth century work , while the authorities such as Manu Smriti do not mention it.
