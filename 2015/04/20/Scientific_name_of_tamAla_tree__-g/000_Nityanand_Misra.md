Dear list members  
  

What is the scientific name of the *Tamāla* tree, famous in Indian literature as an *Upamāna* for dark skin? Monier Williams gives *Xanthochymus pictorius*, some other online sources provide the name *Garcinia xanthochymus*. There is also the similar sounding *Cinnamomum tamala*.  

*

I could not locate a reliable source to be certain, hence the request.
