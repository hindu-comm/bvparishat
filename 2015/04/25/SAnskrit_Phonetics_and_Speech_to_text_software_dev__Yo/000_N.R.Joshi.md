Respected scholars, Nmaskar!



Although Vedic phonetics (Shikshaa) is important subject, not much brain storming is performed hereon BVP.



At least Sanskrit terminology from Shikshaa granthas will be useful to shed light on the ancient thinking of composers of Shikshaa granthas.



Modern day phonetics have made great progress. On internet many softwares are available for English Speech to Text. So half the battle is won. Again the source filter theory of production of speech sounds is there. There are variations from speech to speech in different languages but all human beings have similar vocal organs.



If anybody proficient in different Shikshaa granthas, please share your valuable knowledge with us.Thanks to Dr, Korada who shared with us his power point on Panini Shikshaa. Thanks. NRJOSHI
