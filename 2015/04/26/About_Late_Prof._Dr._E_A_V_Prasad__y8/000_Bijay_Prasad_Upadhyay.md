I came through a research paper of Late Prof.(Dr.)E A V Prasad, Dept.of Geology,Sh. Venkateshwar Tirupati University on earthquakeand also an articlel on detection of ground water. These two were based upon the वृहत संहिता-उदकार्गल एवं भूकम्प-लक्षण-अध्याय । Also he has written books in this. Can anyone give details about him and about his books?
