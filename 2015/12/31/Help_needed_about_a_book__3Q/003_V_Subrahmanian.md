Namaste

  

A friend who tried procuring the above book reported that 'Both the numbers are unreachable and their mail id is bouncing.'

  

Is there any other source for the book“The Tested Easiest Method of Learning and Teaching Sanskrit” by Pandit Brahmadattaji Jihnasu?

  

Thanks and warm regards
