namaste shrI rAmAnujan.

  

I just saw your response. Following our offline discussion (which I can reproduce upon request) last year pertaining to this BVP thread -<https://groups.google.com/d/msg/bvparishat/JlznVYo6Lrc/LY9jBxjuAgAJ> , we were able to access the related video and audio. With your agreement, the videos were uploaded to YouTube. I don't know how I should approach MHRD and CDAC (and furthermore am quite hesitant to spend my limited time on bureaucracy ). Since this project was your brainchild and since you are likely to have the right contacts, if you think that distributing the lectures as podcasts is a good idea, please get me the appropriate permissions and dictate the exact words with which MHRD etc.. should be acknowledged. I will then gladly update the feed with that description. Until then I will hold off further distributing this content.  
  
To other interested people: There are now podcasts pertaining to navyanyAya (sanskrit) and shrIbhAShya (tamil lectures, hitherto available only in YouTube) if you're interested. I've been enjoying the former especially.
