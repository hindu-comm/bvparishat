There is another anecdote, somewhat similar in principle. When Ravana was dying Lord Ram told Lakshmana to go and learn from Ravana, the vast knowledge Ravana had. Lakshman went and asked Ravana for the same but Ravana did not respond. Then Lord Ram himself went and kneeled down and requested Ravana and Ravana complied. Certain decorum needs to be maintained while learning from a teacher, whoever the teacher may be.
