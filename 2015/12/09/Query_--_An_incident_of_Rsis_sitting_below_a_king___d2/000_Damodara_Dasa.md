Hare Krishna.  
  
Dear Vidvaj-janas,  
  
I read somewhere about some rsis who approached a king to learn a  
certain kind of vidya from him. He seated them above him but when they  
asked him to teach them that vidya, he told them that he could not.  
That evening, they (the rsis) discussed among themselves and concluded  
that he (the king) did not teach them because they were sitting above  
him. Next day they sat below him and made the same request, and this  
time the king agreed.  
  
As I heard or read it a long before, I am not able to locate it  
neither do I have information of name etc. of the persons involved in  
this incident. Can anyone from the members of this list help to locate  
as well as give full information of this anecdote?  
  
Thankyou,  
Damodara Das
