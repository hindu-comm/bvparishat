Dear Dr.Rakesh Das,



I am interested in your article. Looking forward to read it.



Translation from one language to another creates problem but within a single language similar problem is noticed. Sanskrit is not exception.



Aadya Shankar said " Shabdajaalam chitta bhramaNa kaaraNam."



Sanskrit words undergo gradual modulation in meanings over the centuries-it was believed by some scholars and I experience that too.



However one way out of this problem in Sanskrit is to take help of VarNavaada. Way before PaNini there was discussion on VarNavaada in the ancient India. Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
