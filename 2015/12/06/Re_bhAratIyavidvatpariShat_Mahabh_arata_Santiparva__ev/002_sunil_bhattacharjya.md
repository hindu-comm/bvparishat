3. In the भूतयज्ञ, बलि is offered to different deities, demons, spirits etc. Many commentators and practitioners (authors of Prayoga and Paddhati texts) have pointed out that the बलिहरण is an offering not unto the fire अनग्नौ.

The sacrifice is not unto the fire. The बलि is accepted by the deity by seeing that it has been sacrificed, but the deity gets the taste of it through the satisfaction, which  the devotees get by eating that. That is why the meat of the बलि is distributed among the devotees. There is a verse on this, in one of the Gita press books.  
  

However in the Mahabharata, Bhishma did not approve this, as he said that the बलि system was introduced by Dhoortas. Probably, only those types of "Himshas" were acceptable, which had to be carried out according to law of the land..
