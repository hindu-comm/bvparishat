Dear Dr Joshi,



1\. The thread initiating post to which you were replying did not make any claim that animal sacrifice did not take place in yajnasin ancient times. The very quote from the Mahabharata is about the animal sacrifice prevalent by the time of Mahabharata. The author of Mahabharata is making one of his characters respond to the practice of animal sacrifice in yajnas prevalent by the time the book was being composed. Bhishma is one of the protagonistcharacters of the narrative. Hence the words of that character are taken with respect as part of the message of the author. What is interesting is that the time of composition of the book is before the advent of Buddhism , influence of which is considered to be responsiblefor the ideas in the Vedic tradition opposing animal sacrifice in yajnas.



2\. That Vedanta aachaaryas right from Sankaracharya through Ramanujacharya and Madhvacharya conducted intense campaign of vegetarianization of the components of Vedic rituals that involved animal sacrifice is well known. But that is considered to be an influence of Buddhism and Jainism on the Vedic tradition. But the Mahabharata evidence disproves this theory and establishes that opposition within the Vedic tradition towards animal sacrifice is prebuddhist.



3.All those who opposed animal sacrifice argued that the Vedic mantrasconsidered as instructing animal sacrifice were misunderstood or misinterpretedby the followers of animal sacrifice. The mantras were ,in fact not instructing animal sacrifice, they argued. In such a context, the question of how apurva can be attained by not following animal sacrifice that is instructed by the mantras, does not make sense to those arguing against animal sacrifice.



Regards,



Nagaraj
