The problem is not the words whether mean what we are popularly given to understand. Both the words of Patanjali,

  

"याज्ञिकाः पठन्ति । स्थूलपृषतीं आग्निवारुणीं अनड्वाहीं आलभेत इति । तस्यां सन्देहः स्थूला च असौ पृषती च स्थूलपृषती स्थूलानि पृषन्ति यस्याः सा स्थूलपृषती । तां न अवैयाकरणः स्वरतः अध्यवस्यति ।"

  

The flexibility of many words and verbs, is because of आलम्भन, - the verb आलभेत could mean different in contentext - with the same prefix and the verb : आ+लभ्

  

1 A. *1 To touch; गामा-*

*लभ्यार्कमीक्ष्य वा Ms. 5. 87, 4. 117; B*k.

14\. 91; सत्येनायुधमालभे; सत्येन (सत्यं)

आत्मानमालभे Mb. *— 2 To get, attain*

*to;* अतितरां कांतिमालप्स्यते ते (वपुः)

Me. 15 v. l.; Kâm. 9. 63. *— 3 To kill,*

*immolate (as a victim in sacrifices);*

प्रातर्वै पशूनालभंते Sat. Br.; गर्दभं पशु-

मालभ्य Y. 3. 280. — 4 To take hold

of, seize, grasp, handle. — 5 To gain

  

to kill, or touch etc. So the verb and the context याज्ञिकाः पठन्ति, the cow or any other animal could be interpreted as either touched or taken hold of, etc. easily both oppose the meaning = to be killed, or sacrificed. As I have seen in other discussion. wheter the पशु is to be killed or not. Madhva-s claim it means only to be touched and it is not to be killed.

Here also बलि means offering only and need not refer to पशु.

  

"हुतं चाप्यहुतं चैव तथा प्रहुतमेव च। प्राशितं *बलिदानं* च पाकयज्ञान्प्रचक्षते।। 7-104-11a 7-104-11b."

  

And hence बलि does not have specific relation with पशु unless the context is of Yaga. In the above all the words relalted to पाकयज्ञ in the case of हुत, अहुत both are different offering. And could not mean referring the Yaga, unless Yaga, like those quoted in Patanjali's Mahabhashya. This explains the next context of Bali also.

This is a different question while बलि can refer or offering of बलि COULD be relalted to पशु or any thing offered, depending on the context, बलिहरण means the same due to the context and there need not be assimilation or dissimilation of the practice.
