Really interesting a topic. I would like to add these:

1.In the srauta tradition/ the textual tradition of the ***Brahmana***s,was the पशु called बलिपशु ? In the Puranic tradition and the Tantric tradition we do get many references.

2\. In the Taittiriya Aranyaka, the Manusmrti, and the Satapathabrahmana and the आश्वलायन गृह्यसूत्र, we get the description as well as prescription of पंचमहायज्ञ . And the भूतयज्ञis called as बलिहरण .

3\. In the भूतयज्ञ, बलि is offered to different deities, demons, spirits etc. Many commentators and practitioners (authors of Prayoga and Paddhati texts) have pointed out that the बलिहरण is an offering not unto the fire अनग्नौ.

4\. We find the practice of offering bali in the Tantric tradition (the instance referred to by Dr Bhat is one of the many).

5\. Can we presume that the practice of बलिहरण was incorporated into the श्रौत / Brahmanic tradition in a later phase?( the phase represented by Taittiriya Aranyaka and the आश्वलायन गृह्यसूत्र etc.)
