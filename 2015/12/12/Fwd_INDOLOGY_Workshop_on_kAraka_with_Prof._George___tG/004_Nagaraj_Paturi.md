There can be no second opinion in saying that Prof. George Cardona is one of the greatest scholars of Paninian studies in contemporary times. His Shraddha towards tradition sometimes surpasses that of many Indian origin scholars of Sanskrit.



But he himself may not appreciate calling a great scholar of Paninian studies as modern Panini.



No offence intended.
