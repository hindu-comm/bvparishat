I believe Prof. Wakankar was using the term in the sense of ‘Abhinavapāṇini’. Several modern day scholars of grammar have been called ‘Abhinavapāṇini’ by their students and admirers out of respect for their profound scholarship. It is a fact that there has been no second Pāṇini, and the term does not indicate that these scholars are equal to Pāṇini. Perhaps the term indicates that it is Pāṇini who continues to live in these Gurus of Pāṇinian grammar, just as a father continues to live in his son (*ātmā vai jāyate putraḥ*) . I know of two scholars who are often referred to as ‘Abhinavapāṇini’. One is Paṇḍita Cārudeva Śāstrī, author of phenomenal works like ‘Upasargārthacandrikā’ and ‘Vyākaraṇacandrodayaḥ’, and father of Dr. Satyavrata Śāstrī. The other is Paṇḍita Rāmaprasāda Tripāṭhī of Varanasi, whose works are less known but whose students include stalwarts like Puṣpā Dīkṣita, Ramānātha Śarmā, and Jagadguru Svāmī Rāmabhadrācārya.
