The original question was:



"The common component caries the same meaning or different? Please kindly explain relationship between these two words".



The answer by Prof. Korada:



among various meanings of dakshiNA , it is the meaning of 'right side' (in contrast to left side ) that is common between the two words and the prefix pra- is used here in the sense of pro- =towards and pradakshiNa is, thus, towards right, and thus, clockwise, pradakshiNa as circular motion or going around (something/somebody) is a lAkshaNikArtha coming from this meaning of 'towards right' or 'clockwise'.
