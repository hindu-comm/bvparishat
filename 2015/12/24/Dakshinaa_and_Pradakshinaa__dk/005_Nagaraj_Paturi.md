Once that original question is answered, subsidiary question would be how the various other meanings of dakshiNA are connected to the meaning of the root daksh?



दक्ष वृद्धौ शीघ्रार्थे च has been mentioned by Prof. Korada.



How various meanings of dakshiNA 1. south 2. right 3. what is given 'dAnasAdguNyArtham' or in exchange for any pApabhanjaka favour by the purohita or 'vidyAdAnasAdguNyArtham' to guru 4. meaning of the base word of dAkshiNya =compassion 5. meaning of the pUrvapada of words such as dakshiNa nAyaka are connected to the meaning of the root daksh and what are the meanings of daksh other than those mentioned by Prof. Korada that are connected to each of such meanings is an interesting aspect to study.



daksh seems to be connected to competence too as we have dakshah = competent.
