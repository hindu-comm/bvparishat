Namaste,  
  

I understand that in common parlance, the dakshinA has also been interpreted as fees paid to a person, from whom the services or favours have been received. For example, if one wants to give some DAna for pacifying a graha, one requests the graha-davajna to receive the dAna and when the graha-daivajna accepts the dAna, one pays dakshinA to him (the graha-daivajna) as fees for that favour and also to meet the expenses in the form of time spent by the receiver of the dAna as well as to meet the other expenses the graha-daivajna might have incurred for transportation etc. to receive the dAna.  
  

Similarly one pays the guru for all the favours that the guru had done to one.  
  
As no dakshina can match the favours or services received, it is customary to add that whatever dakshinA has been given is only to the ability of the giver ( and not to match the favours received).
