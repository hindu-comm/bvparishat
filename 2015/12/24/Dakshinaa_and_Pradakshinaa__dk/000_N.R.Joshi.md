Dear Prof S. Korada,



Some time ago on BVP, you explained, " Yat kincit dadAti tat daks'iNA". In the word " Pradaks'iNA" there is the component of "daks'iNA". The common component caries the same meaning or different? Please kindly explain relationship between these two words. Thanks. N.R.Joshi



I wish you all members happy and peaceful the coming holiday season. N.R.Joshi
