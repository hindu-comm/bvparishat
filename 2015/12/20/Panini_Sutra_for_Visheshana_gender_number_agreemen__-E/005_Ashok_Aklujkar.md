The cases cited so far (वेदा: प्रमाणम्,शैत्यं हि यत् सा प्रकृतिर्जलस्य etc.) are instances of appositional (sāmānādhikraṇya) constructions, not of the viśeṣya-viśṣaṇa-bhāvya as I believe was intended in the question.

  

One should also bear in mind in this connection that the Skt term viśeṣaṇa stands for‘adjective’ as well as‘qualifier’. The latter term can cover the former but the former does not always cover the latter (contrast buddhimān putraḥ with rājñaḥ putraḥ). The reference made to Gadādhara states the same difference between the two uses of viśeṣaṇa differently, because Gadādhara does not have the convenience English makes available to us.
