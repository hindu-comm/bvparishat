Namonamha...  
When the word विषय: is considered as कर्मणि अच्प्रत्ययान्त it means 'object.' Then अपरविद्याविषयम् is to be taken as tatpurusha combound.
The object of lower knowledge. There the gender problem occurs. विषयशब्द normally is musculin. So to solve this problem here the word विषय: must be considered as करणे अच्प्रत्ययान्त.Now the meaning is - 'that by which something is objectified ( made object)'. In the sense, the combound is bahuvreehi. And now the gender problem is solved. The truth which is objectified by the lower knowledge is कर्मफललक्षणम् or आपेक्षिकम्..or whatever. Please carefully note that in eithr combound,
the wanted meaning remains the same. The way suggested by Sree Koradaji (विषयशब्द can be rarely napumsaka) is nice and admissible, no doubt. In that case अविद्याया: विषयम् is the vigrahavaakya.But note that 'rarely'. Either one has to take the word in napumsakam or the word must be taken as करणे अच्प्रत्यय. No third solution is here in this issue arised by sree venkeshmurthy......vishnunamboodiri.
