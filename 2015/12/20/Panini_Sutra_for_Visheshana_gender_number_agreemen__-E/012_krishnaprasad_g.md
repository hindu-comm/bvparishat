The latter term can cover the former but the former does not always cover the latter (contrast buddhimān putraḥ with rājñaḥ putraḥ). The reference made to Gadādhara states the same difference between the two uses of viśeṣaṇa differently, because Gadādhara does not have the convenience English makes available to us.

\> You correctly pointed out the term viśeṣaṇa stands for both ‘adjective’ and ‘qualifier’. Is there any work which throws light on which of these two senses is closer to the term viśeṣaṇa as it is used in Vyākaraṇa and Nyāya works.  
  

For very basics, read Higher Sanskrit Grammar and Syntax By Anundoram Borroah. Sanskrit Composition By VS Apte. Vagvyavaharadarsha Sanskrit Version (not Hindi version) Charudeva Shastri

Is there is a difference in the two traditions when it comes to their treatment of the term viśeṣaṇa?

\> It also appears that \[at least at some places\] in Vyākaraṇa works, the term viśeṣaṇa is used in the sense of ‘qualifier’. In the explanation of the aphorism viśeṣaṇaṃ viśeṣyeṇa bahulam (PS 2.1.55), the Kāśikā provides the definition bhedakaṃ viśeṣaṇaṃ bhedyaṃ viśeṣyam, which may be translated as ‘viśeṣaṇa is the distinguisher and viśeṣyam is the distinguished’. The terms ‘distinguisher’ and ‘distinguished’ are used by Rama Nath Sharma in The Aṣṭādhyāyī of Pāṇini (2002), Volume II (Second edition, ISBN 91-215-0653-0, New Delhi: Munshiram Manoharlala, 2002, p. 55). The Siddhāntakaumudī also explains viśeṣaṇa as ‘bhedaka’ and viśeṣya as ‘bhedya’ by saying bhedakaṃ bhedyena samānādhikaraṇena bahulaṃ prāgvat. I do not know if at other places in Vyākaraṇa works the term viśeṣaṇa is used in the sense of ‘adjective’ and not ‘qualifier’. I also do not know in what sense Sh. Venkatesh Murthy used the term.

Commentaries tell us that the word samānādhikaraṇena from 2.1.47 pūrvakālaikasarvajaratpurāṇanavakevalāḥ samānādhikaraṇena is carried into 2.1.55 by anuvṛtti. Is it this anuvṛtti that says that there need not always be sāmānādhikaraṇya (same vibhakti and vacana) between viśeṣaṇa and viśeṣya? For if there was always sāmānādhikaraṇya between viśeṣaṇa and viśeṣya, there would be no need to carry forward the term samānādhikaraṇena from 2.1.47 into 2.1.55. Could this be the jñāpana that Sh. Venkatesh Murthy is looking for in the Aṣṭādhyāyī?
