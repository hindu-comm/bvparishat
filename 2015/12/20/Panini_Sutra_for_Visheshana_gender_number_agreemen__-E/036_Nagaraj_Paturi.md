\>Those people with Advaita knowledge can tell you both readings are possible.

\>सत्यम् can be उद्देश्य also. अपरविद्याविषयं can be उद्देश्य also. If सत्यम् is उद्देश्य अपरविद्याविषयं isBahuvrihi.

If अपरविद्याविषयं is उद्देश्य it is Tatpurusha.



1\. If there is an underlying assumption that my participation was intended to defend the tatpurusha argument, the assumption is a misunderstanding. All my uddEs'ya-vidhEya analysis supports the bahuvrihi argument only.



2\. I only wanted topoint outthat the agreementbetween अपरविद्याविषयम् andसत्यम् was based onuddEs'ya-vidhEyarelation and notvis'EshaNa - vis'Eshya relation.



3\. \>Those people with Advaita knowledge can tell you both readings are possible.

 -May I humbly submit that I am one of those, thoughI can not claim that knowledge to be of any high degree.

4\. All the three sentences under discussion are explanations of the sentence "तदेतत्सत्यम्"



5\. तदेतत् is pronominal. Usually pronominal wordis subject. The other word in the sentence is predicate. All the three sentences maintain this subject-predicate structure of the explained sentence. That is, all the three have सत्यम् as predicate. The fourth sentence too has the contrarily related word अनृतम् as predicate.



6\. 'This is his house' and 'His house is this' communicate two different meaningsbecause the word/phrase which is subject in one sentence turns out to be predicate in the other.
