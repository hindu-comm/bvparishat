Pranams Sri Paturi sir

  

You wrote -

"But we can change the sentence like this:

That subject matter of the lower knowledge constituted by the results of Karma, the Truth, is only relatively so."

Problem with this is 'is only relatively so' hereapplies to 'subject matter of the lower knowledge '. But there is no yogyataa between the two. That is , any subject matter can not be relatively so.

  

You are correct. The correct changed sentence can be this -

'That subject matter of the lower knowledge constituted by the results of Karma is only the relative Truth.'

  

कर्मफललक्षणम् यत् अपरविद्याविषयं तत् (अपरविद्याविषयं) आपेक्षिकम्सत्यं( अस्ति)

Here कर्मफललक्षणम् is adjective for अपरविद्याविषयं. It is also Uddeshya. आपेक्षिकम्सत्यंis Vidheya.

  

But one question will be there - Why use नपुंसकलिंग for अपरविद्याविषय instead of पुल्लिंग ?

This is where Tikakara Anandagiri's explanation is required.

Here अपरविद्याविषयं becomes Tatpurusha Samasa.

  

If you take your analysis below

कर्मफललक्षणम् अपरविद्याविषयं च यत् सत्यं( अस्ति) तत् (सत्यं) आपेक्षिकम्(अस्ति)

  

अपरविद्याविषयं is विशेषण for सत्यं. Therefore अपरविद्याविषयं is Bahuvrihi Samasa.

  

  

Is the above analysis correct?
