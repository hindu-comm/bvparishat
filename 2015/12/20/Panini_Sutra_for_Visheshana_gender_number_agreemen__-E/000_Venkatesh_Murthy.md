Namo Vidvadbhyah

  

In Sanskrit Visheshana must havesame gender, number, and case endingof Visheshya, like

महाधना नारी, महाधनः पुरुषः, महाधनाः पुरुषाः,महाधनाय पुरुषाय, महाधनस्य पुरुषस्य and so on.

  

I like to know which Panini Sutra is saying this. If it is not in Panini Sutras where is the rule?

  

Regards
