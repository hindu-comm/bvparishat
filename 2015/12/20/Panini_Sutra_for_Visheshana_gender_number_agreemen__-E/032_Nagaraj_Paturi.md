1\. सत्यम् is already there in the mantra; commentator needs to preserve the word and make his own words agree with that.



2\. In Sanskrit, when the yougikaartha of a word is emphasized the user/speaker of the word takes liberty with the gender (word ending suffix) to suit the agreement requirements. Anandagiri shows how yougikaartha of the stem vishaya is emphasized by Sankara here.



3.कर्मफललक्षणम् and आपेक्षिकम् are vis'EshaNa words for the uddEs'ya अपरविद्याविषयं . All are made to agree with the word सत्यम्
