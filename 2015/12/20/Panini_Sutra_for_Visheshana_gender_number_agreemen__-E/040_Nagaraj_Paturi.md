\> Is the above analysis correct?



----- correct, except thatin

कर्मफललक्षणम् यत् अपरविद्याविषयं तत् (अपरविद्याविषयं) आपेक्षिकम्सत्यं( अस्ति)

Here कर्मफललक्षणम् is adjective for अपरविद्याविषयं. It is also Uddeshya. आपेक्षिकम्सत्यंis Vidheya.



"It is also Uddeshya" is not correct. It is also Uddeshya here means कर्मफललक्षणम् is Uddeshya. A word can not be an adjective to a noun and be subject/uddeshya at the same time. Only a vis'Eshya can be subject/uddEs'ya. Thus here, अपरविद्याविषयंis uddEs'ya. You probably had this in mind. Probably that is why you said, " Here अपरविद्याविषयं becomes Tatpurusha Samasa.". You are right. If you take the anvaya given by you which is, कर्मफललक्षणम् यत् अपरविद्याविषयं तत् (अपरविद्याविषयं) आपेक्षिकम्सत्यं( अस्ति), अपरविद्याविषयं becomes Tatpurusha Samasa. Then अपरविद्याविषयं would be अपरविद्यारूपकविषयं and not अपरविद्या यस्य विषयं (अस्ति) तत्. Anandagiripaada's वस्तुपरत्वान्नपुंसकलिङ्गत्वं is independent of agreement aspect and hence is sufficient to justify napumsakatva of vishayam in the tatpurusha too.



Prof. Korada's view was also that अपरविद्यारूपकविषयंis tatpurusha only.




This apart, the following is my observation on Swami Gabhirananda's English translation and not your post:



Lower knowledge is not a good translation for अपरविद्या. अपरविद्या is being used here in contrast toपरविद्या. Then परविद्या turns out to be higher knowledge. Then what will be अविद्या?Will that be non-knowledge ?



I don't think the terms परविद्या and अपरविद्या have any value connotations such as higher and lower.I think the terms are neutral, value-free descriptions of two kinds of knowledge.
