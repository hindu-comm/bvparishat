Pranams Sri Paturi sir

  

I saw English Translation by Swami Gambhirananda on page 113 Vol II Eight Upanishads

  

That Truth that is constituted by the results of Karma, the subject matter of the lower knowledge, is only relatively so.

  

Here we can see 'Truth' is subject or उद्देश्य and 'the subject matter of the lower knowledge' is predicate विधेय.

  

But we can change the sentence like this.

  

That subject matter of the lower knowledge constituted by the results of Karma, the Truth, is only relatively so.

  

Here the subject matter of the lower knowledge is subject उद्देश्य and the Truth is विधेय.

  

Both are correct from Advaita point of view.

  

The questionnow - is there any rule the Samasa in subject must be Tatpurusha if there is only one word in the Subject?
