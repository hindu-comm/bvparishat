Dear Prof. Aklujkar Ji,



You correctly pointed out the term *viśeṣaṇa* stands for both ‘adjective’ and ‘qualifier’. Is there any work which throws light on which of these two senses is closer to the term *viśeṣaṇa* as it is used in Vyākaraṇa and Nyāya works. Is there is a difference in the two traditions when it comes to their treatment of the term *viśeṣaṇa*?



In the particular example of “vedāḥ pramāṇam” from Vyutpattivāda, it appears the term *viśeṣaṇa* is used in the sense of ‘qualifier’. There is a direct statement by Gadādahara to the effect that the word ‘pramāṇa’ is a viśeṣaṇa:

Quote

vedāḥ pramāṇamityatra ca viśeṣaṇapadottaravibhaktyā bahutvaviruddhamekatvaṃ vivakṣitaṃ tacca prakṛtyarthatāvacchedake pramitikaraṇatve’nveti

Unquote



It also appears that \[at least at some places\] in Vyākaraṇa works, the term *viśeṣaṇa* is used in the sense of ‘qualifier’. In the explanation of the aphorism *viśeṣaṇaṃ viśeṣyeṇa bahulam* (PS 2.1.55), the Kāśikā provides the definition *bhedakaṃ viśeṣaṇaṃ bhedyaṃ viśeṣyam*, which may be translated as ‘viśeṣaṇa is the distinguisher and viśeṣyam is the distinguished’. The terms ‘distinguisher’ and ‘distinguished’ are used by Rama Nath Sharma in The Aṣṭādhyāyī of Pāṇini (2002), Volume II (Second edition, ISBN 91-215-0653-0, New Delhi: Munshiram Manoharlala, 2002, p. 55). The Siddhāntakaumudī also explains *viśeṣaṇa* as ‘bhedaka’ and *viśeṣya* as ‘bhedya’ by saying *bhedakaṃ bhedyena samānādhikaraṇena bahulaṃ prāgvat*. I do not know if at other places in Vyākaraṇa works the term viśeṣaṇa is used in the sense of ‘adjective’ and not ‘qualifier’. I also do not know in what sense Sh. Venkatesh Murthy used the term.



Anyway, I end with some additional comments on PS 2.1.55 *viśeṣaṇaṃ viśeṣyeṇa bahulam*. Commentaries tell us that the word *samānādhikaraṇena* from 2.1.47 *pūrvakālaikasarvajaratpurāṇanavakevalāḥ samānādhikaraṇena* is carried into 2.1.55 by *anuvṛtti*. Is it this *anuvṛtti* that says that there need not always be *sāmānādhikaraṇya* (same *vibhakti* and *vacana*) between *viśeṣaṇa* and *viśeṣya*? For if there was always *sāmānādhikaraṇya* between *viśeṣaṇa* and *viśeṣya*, there would be no need to carry forward the term *samānādhikaraṇena* from 2.1.47 into 2.1.55. Could this be the *jñāpana* that Sh. Venkatesh Murthy is looking for in the Aṣṭādhyāyī?



Thanks, Nityanand
