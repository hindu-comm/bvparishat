Trikandasesha is a suuplement to Amarakosa. Dr. Bhagavan Panda has given the ref. as it is a lexicon of Odia words. May be he would have mistaken as the works of Purushottama are available plenty in Odisha.

The book History of Sanskrit Lexicography by Madhuakar M. Patkar published in 1981 by Munshiram Manoharlal is also an authentic book on the subject.
