Friends,  
  
IndiaDivine.org an outfit of an ISKCON unit in Los Angeles published this article.  
<http://www.indiadivine.org/sanskrit-poets-and-scholars-of-orissa/>  
  

It seems like a well researched article. Has anyone seen its original publication?  

I will appreciate comments on the merits of the research.  
  

Thank you.
