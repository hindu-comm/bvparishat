Striking comment can be made this entry of Sanskrit earlier writers:

3\. Purusottama Deva – 850 A. D. – Trikandasesa, a book of Lexicon on Orissan Culture and Oriya words.

It is a new information that Trikandasesa is a lexicon of Orissan Culture and Oriya words.

As we Sanskrit scholars know, it is a lexicon of Sanskrit Words popularly used for quotations in Sanskrit commentaries and Purushottama, himself a Sanskrit grammarian.

I could not understand, what he means as a Lexicon of Orissan Culture and Oriya Words. I doubt whether he has seen the lexicon or just heard of a Orissa Lexicographer.Or he might have meant Sanskrit words representing Orissan culture and prevalent in the works of Oriyan writers' sanskrit writings. But as the lexical works are listed by Vogel, in his History of Lexicography, they are all Sanskrit Lexicons. Bhashavritti is another Vritti on Paninian Grammar, as the name itself suggests, excepting Vedic Sutras, it is written on the Sutras related to Bhasa. Vogel considers both the grammarian and Lexicographer Purushottama deva are identical.
