There is reference to the scholar working on the manuscript in Asiatic Library, Calcutra and you can directly ask him whether he has given such statement if such a scholar exists in the Society.

“Interestingly in this version, there are just five kandas (sections) instead of the accepted seven. There is no Balakanda – the part that deals with Rama’s childhood – or Uttarkanda. This Ramayana ends with the return of Rama and Sita from exile and his ascension to the Ayodhya throne,” said Anasuya Bhowmick, lead scholar of the Asiatic Society, who is working with the manuscript.

Or some other scholar members from Calcutta may ascertain whether such a news is true or a hoax.
