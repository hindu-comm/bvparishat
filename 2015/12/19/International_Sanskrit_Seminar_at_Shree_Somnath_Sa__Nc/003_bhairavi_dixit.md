Respected Gargeshwariji,

  

Thanks for your concern.

  

You attempted to correct language by devising complex sentences into simple structure, without changing the connotative or denotative meaning of the text. Idea, thought, purpose or intention are more important than whether it has been posted in simple or in complex structure. My notion behind posting was/is not to exhibit the display of my English but to simply share my intrinsic feeling of togetherness, sharing and expression in the most devoted place of the universe. Being a Gujarati, I feel proud to welcome all scholars of Sanskrit.It was simply the output and outburst of an Emotion recollect in tranquility and I have never thought of it to be read in such narrow and dogmatic fashion.



I hope you will agree with my feelings.

  

Thanks & regards

  

JAY SOMNATH
