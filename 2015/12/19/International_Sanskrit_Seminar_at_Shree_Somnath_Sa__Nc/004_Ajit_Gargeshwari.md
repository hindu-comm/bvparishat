You must be joking Good Luck! I was not writing about simple or complex sntence structure but basic grammar for comprehension. Please don't accuse me, its good if you follow elementary English grammar or at least make your sentences readable if you don't want to do it its your will and wish. An out burst of emotive feeling is a good experience to any human irrespective of or whether one is a Gujarati and or Marthi but spontaneous emotional out burst needs to be comprehensible for all members. Please see rules of posting if you have a doubt. I shall leave this thread with this note
