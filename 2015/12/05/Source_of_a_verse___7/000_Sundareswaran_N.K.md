Dear Scholars,

I would like to get the source of (and the full text) the verse, the second half of which is निमेषं ज्वलितं श्रेयो न तुधूमायितं चिरम्। My friend, Prof. K. Vishnu Namputiri, says it has got another version as वरं मुहूर्तं ज्वलितं न तुधूमायितं चिरम्।

Kindly help me.

Thanking you in advance
