Respected Scholars,

  

I thank you very much for the vivid explanation. The difference between *homa* and *yajna*/*yAga* is made clear with quotations.

By mistake the request was sent twice. Please forgive me for that. I once again, thank all scholars for enlightening me on the subject.

  

Respectfully,

  

Ramchander Deekonda
