Something I wrote quite some time ago.

  

\|\| *yajno vai viShNuH \|\|*  
 We hear about various homas such as Rudrahoma, chaNDI homa, etc.,  
 and also terms such as rAjasUya yAga, ashvamedha yAga or yajna, and  
 so on. yAga and yajna are synonyms but not homa and yajna. A homa  
is technically different from a yajna. This is explained in the  
Apastamba shrauta sUtra:  
  
 juhotichodanaH svAhAkArapradAnaH darvIhomaH \|  
 yajatichodanaH, vashhaTkArapradAnaH yAgaH \|  
  
 When something is enjoined by the word "juhoti" or "juhuyAt.h"  
 (meaning "offers oblations") and oblations are offered with the  
 word "svAhA", then it is a Homa, performed using the ladle or wooden  
 spoon. When something is enjoined by the word "yajati" (yajate)  
 (meaning "sacrifices") and oblations are offered with the word  
 "vashhaT.h", then it is a "yajna" or "yAga."  
  
 Humans are pleased by praise, the pitR^i's (manes) by obeisances,  
 and the Gods (devas) are pleased by yajnas. So says the Veda:  
 manushhyA vA IDenyAH pitaro namasyA devA yajniyAH \|  
 (taittirIya saMhitA 2.5.9)  
  
Since the yajnas of yore are rarely performed these days, we see the  
homas as taking the place of yajnas in much the same way as the pUjA  
has gained prominence over the vaishvadeva ritual.
