I am not sure if this is relevant to Vidwan Sri Ramchander Deekonda's enquiry. If his question originated in his observation on the puja-like yagas being performed nowadays, whether they are or are not connected to the purely Vedic yajnas of yore , An article by one Timothy Lubin on Academia.edu, discussing the historical developments of homa-puja connection may be helpful.
