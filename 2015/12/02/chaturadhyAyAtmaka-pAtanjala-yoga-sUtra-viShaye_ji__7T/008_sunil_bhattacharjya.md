Dear friends,  
  

The total number of verses in the twelve chapters of the Yogayajnavalkya is 508 (501 full verses + 7 half verses). It has 98 verses on Yama, Niyama and Asana (from the 8th verse of the first chapter to the end of the third chapter), excluding the firat 7 general introductory verses of the first chapter. Thus the number of verses on Rajayog in the Yogayajnavalkya is 410 (508 - 98). Is it by any chance that someone somewhere has mantioned about these 410 Rajayoga verses in the Yogayajnavalkya?  
  

Regards,
