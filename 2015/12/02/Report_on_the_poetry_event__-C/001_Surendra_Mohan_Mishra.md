Dear Mishra Babu,

  

Thanks, thanks ! I saw n read through. It's marvelous to poetically touch upon the tones in a foreign land. They say in early times the English also got a lot many cues from our literary masterpieces. They say some Indian boy in Mid Summer Nights Dream of Shakespeare was the prototype of those who communicated our stories to the offshore people. That's how we find so much affinity between Bhaasa's Swapnavasavadattam n Shakespeare's Twelfth Night n so on !

  

I feel so great n grateful that you're going to organize an entirely Samskrit poetic event in '17. Advance congrats n best wishes for the same. sarasvatii s'rutimahatii mahiiyataam !

  

  

punya janmabhuumi punya devaalaya

uddharibaa paain kale tanukshaya

maanavajiibana huai saphala

e mahaadiikshaa ki bujhiba utkala !

  

With warmest regards,

SMMishra
