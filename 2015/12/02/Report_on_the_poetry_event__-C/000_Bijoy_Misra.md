Here is a report of our effort.  

<http://inenews.com/2015/11/voice-of-the-people-an-afternoon-of-poetry/>  
We include Sanskrit next year.  

We do a pure Sanskrit recitation event in 2017.  
  

I would like to know if any of you has tried to create musical rendering  

of any section of Valmiki Ramayana. I am particularly looking  
at Bharata's meeting with Rama in Chitrakuta. We have scheduling an event in May.
