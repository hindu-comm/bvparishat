Prof. Korada Subrahmanyam is a scholar of renown in Vyakarana, Mimamsa, Nyaya and Vedanta with deep expertise in Alankarasastra, Sanskrit literature and Telugu literature, not to mention Vedas, Jyotisha, Darsanas and other Vedangas. Srinatha, a great Telugu poet of the 15th century, wrote many works including *Śṛngāranaiṣadhamu*, a Telugu translation of Śrīharṣa's Sanskrit kavya,*Naiṣadhīyacaritam*. The Sanskrit original is replete with reference to various Sastras which Srinatha handled with great aplomb in translation.

  

To truly appreciate the greatness of such poetry, one should listen to Prof. Korada Subrahmanyam who studied the Sanskrit original, the Telugu translation (Śrīnāthayugamu washis major during hisBhāṣāpravīṇa in Telugu) and the Sastras from which the poetic material is often drawn. The lecture would also cover other works of Srinatha. There will be no other lecture during the event. As aprecursorto the main event, Sanskrit Slokas and Telugu Poems fromŚrīnorinṛsimhodāharaṇam would be recited by scholars for half-an-hour from 6:00 pm to 6:30 pm.

  

All are welcome. Kindly pass on to those interested in Telugu literature.
