Respected scholars,

  

As I remember, some days back there was a discussion regarding the date of Buddha. Recently, while going through the thread on 6th century Ramayna, in the same site of IndiaDivine.org, I read an article which would throw archaeological evidence on the date of Buddha.

Those who are interested can see the Attachment.

  

With regards.

Tapati Sinha
