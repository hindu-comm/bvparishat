The reservations of Prof. Paturi and Bhattacharya are understandable. If I had not felt something similar, I would not have used the word “possibility”. Note also my word “habit”. It is writing habit that I had in mind, not any habit in (phonetic) perception.  
  
Regarding Prof. Bhattacharya’s specific point, I should present my observation: Indians hear English “t” and “d” both as a dental sound and as a retroflex sound. North Indians generally think of “London” as लन्दन. Maharashtrians and South Indians tend to write the same word as लण्डन (I am agreeing here with Prof. Bhattacharya’s statement about South Indians). This is understandable, especially because the actual English sound is between द् and ड्. The same thing with English “t” (at least in some positions within a word).  
  
The way I reasoned was this: A person who gets into the habit of writing “th” for “t” in romanized words (mostly Indian but possibly a few non-Indian or English words) can slip into doing the same writing when he/she sees “t” in an English word. After all, one is not always aware of the linguistic affiliation of a word when one writes or copies.  
  
As with the other conjectures made so far, let us hope that the person who actually did the writing will enlighten as to what actually happened when the announcement text was written. He/she may even have simply copied someone else’s erroneous writing and may not be the originator of what we are discussing seriously.  
  
If one does not entertain a possibility like the one I did, one must credit the writer with a rather sophisticated joke or pun. Will he/she risk indulging in a joke or pun when the context calls for unambiguous transmission of some simple matter-0f-fact information?  
  
I will look for English words showing influence of the South Indian way of writing Sanskrit dentals. Perhaps BVP members can help me in the search. Checking other occurrences of “matrix” in South Indian publications may also enlighten us.
