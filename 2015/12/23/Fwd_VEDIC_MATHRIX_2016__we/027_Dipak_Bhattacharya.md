Dear Friends,  

Since my knowledge of Tamil pronunciation and orthography is limited I do not claim great accuracy in what I said. It came from exchange of ideas. Long ago a Tamil student told me that त is written as *th* in Tamil transliteration since otherwise that is to say if written *t* it would be read ट. I was speaking from that experience. 

Best

DB
