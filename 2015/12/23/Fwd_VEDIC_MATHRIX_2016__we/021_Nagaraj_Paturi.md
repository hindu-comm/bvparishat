Since this came from Prof. Aklujkar, I am not able to brush this aside as a misunderstanding or poor understanding of linguistics of south Indian languages. Respected professor certainly must be having some basis for his guess and the observation on which the guess is based.



But I have not seen a south Indian misspelling an English word while writing it in English on account of his hearing or imagining one English phone as another.



Mother tongue influenceis possible while writing an English word in a non-English script meant for writing the writer's mother tongue.



Prof. Aklujkar must be having a few examples of a south Indian misspelling an English word while writing it in English on account of his hearing or imagining one English phone as another.



I am curious to see those for improving my linguistic understanding.
