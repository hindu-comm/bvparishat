The very title " *Vedic* *Mathrix*" doesn't seem to convey any of the content of the workshop listed by Mr.Murthy and it was taken as mean Vedic Mathematics by Mr. Mishra who is also master in Sanskrit as well as statistics. which is his domain while Muurthyji has listed all the Ancient Mathematics, by the same title " *Vedic* *Mathrix*". The title doesn't convey anything to me as I have not heard such word *Mathrix*.
