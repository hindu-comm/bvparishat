There is a name for words which somewhat resemble our pratyAhAra-s.

They combine the first portion of the first word, and the last portion of the last word.

They are called "**portmanteau** words".

  

Some famous examples :

  

breakfast + lunch     = brunch

smoke   + fog       = smog

web     + log       = blog

diabetes  + obesity    = diabesity

electronic + mail      = email

fourteen  + nights    = fortnight

guess    + estimate  = guesstimate

oxford   + cambridge = oxbridge

outside   + patient    = outpatient

motor   + hotel     = motel
