Professor Rani Sadashivamurthy Ji

  

I hope by *Vedic texts* you mean Samhitas, Brahmanas, Aranyakas, and Upanishads (this is the general understanding of Vedic texts). It is misleading to term post-Vedic texts in Jyotisha or Tantra tradition as Vedic texts, just as it is misleading to term commentaries on Upanishads in Vedanta tradition as Upanishad texts, or commentaries on Puranas as Puranic texts.

  

You say most of the content is from Vedic texts. I doubt if it is indeed so. From the camp highlights, most content appears to be from post-Vedic texts. Anyway we do not have the lecture schedule so we cannot be sure of the content. I request Shefali Ji and the camp organizers to share the complete lecture schedule and the content of each lecture. I am sure a five-day residential camp will have a detailed plan. We can then decide which content can be claimed as Vedic and which not, and whether calling the event *Vedic Mathrix* is justified or not.

  

Let us also not forget that the School of Vedic Maths, the co-organizer, is blatantly propagating falsehoods on their website about a non-existent Parishishta of Atharvaveda and non-existent 16 volumes that were magically lost. Any claim from such an institution is to be taken with a grain of salt.

  

Thanks, Nityanand
