In the list given by Prof Kanna electronic + mail = email, email is not portmanteau email is abbreviation for Electronic Mail its an acronym. Electronic Mail is commonly called Email**.** As I understand Portmanteau word fuses both the sounds and the meanings of its components, as in smog an the other listed example. Now is 'Mathrix' a Portmanteau?
