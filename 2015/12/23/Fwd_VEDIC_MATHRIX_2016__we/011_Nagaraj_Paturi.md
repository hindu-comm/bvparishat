\> Vedic is an English adjective listed in the Oxford dictionary and defined as "relating to the Veda or the Vedas". It is also listed as a noun, defined as "the language of the Vedas, an early form of Sanskrit". Vaidika is a Sanskrit word, not used in English. One has to bear this distinction in mind.



Thanks for enlightening me about thepieces of knowledge such as
'Vedic' is an English adjective and noun. Vaidika is a Sanskrit word andfor asking me to bear that distinction in mind.

(However, Vaidikalike many other suchSanskrit words is freely used as part of English sentences)



1\. Let me make it clear that my post was not to justify the label 'Vedic Mathematics' used bySvāmī Bhāratī Kṛṣṇa Tīrtha.In fact, way back, when I first saw the book, I asked myself 'what is so Vedic about this book?'. When I took this book to my father who was taking me into several books of Vaidika shastras forseveral interesting notions of mathematics contained in them, he asked me 'what is so Vedic about this book?' When we were conducting monthly lectures on sciences in the Vedas throughthe platform of Vedavijnana Vedika at Hyderabad, all the scholar members of the forum put it as one of the conditions that mathematics discussion should not be on the lines of this book. Whena person approached me to give permission to conduct classes on 'Vedic mathematics' on the basis of that book, when I forwarded the request to the university authorities, they asked me to permit it under the title 'speed maths' not'Vedic maths'. All this shows that to talk about the wrongness of the title of that book is beating a dead horse.



2\. But at the same time,the validity of the word and notion of Vedic mathematicscan not and should not be brushed aside. Many ancient Indian books in Sanskrit, Prakrit and other Indian languages had a hugecontent of mathematics. Many of such books had connections with Vedic rituals, ideas, culture etc. and as such can justifiably be called books containing Vedic mathematics.
