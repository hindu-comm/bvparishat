Dear Sri Nityanand Misra Ji!

  

I think the Camp has nothing to do with The **Vedic Mathematics** Text of **Shri Shri Shri Bharathi Krishna Tirtha** as found in the contents of the Camp specified in the pamphlet.

  

Moreover the Sefali ji also calls it a **Camp on Ancient Indian Mathematics**.

When we curiously go through the pamphlet it covers the following aspects:

  

1. Story of Numerals, Zero and Pi - These have their sources Vedic Sources



2. Yantras (Mystic Diagrams) - These are found in the Tantras which of course are offspring of the Vedic Tradition to a greater extent

  

3. Triplets, Construction of Rational Figures, Geometry and Algebra - These have their origin from the Sulbasutra Texts of Vedic lore and the Astronomical texts like Siddhanta Siromani which belong to the Jyotisha Sastram, one of the Six ancillaries of the Vedas

4. Mathematics in Indian Scriptures - To be known from the participants what they are going to teach under this section

  

5. Stories of Mathematicians - I think this section covers most of the Kerala Astronomers and even the Ancient Indian Astronomers of other regions of Bharata desa, who were great contributors to the field of Indian Mathematics (Indirectly in turn makes a part of the Jyotisha Sastra of Shadangas of the Vedas)

  

  

In case this camp is meant for teaching all these said contents as shown in their "Camp Brochure" - I am sure it will be a very essential camp in right time. Since most of its content is from the Vedic Texts and from the other texts of Vedic-related traditions calling it a Camp on Vedic Mathematics (Which is other than that of Sri Bharathi Krishna Tirtha) is not objectionable I believe.

  

I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE A LITTLE MORE LENGTH OF SPACE HERE TO SUPPORT OF THE CONTENT OF THE CAMP.

  

  

Indeed, there is a lot worth learning in the field of our Ancient Indian Mathematics from the above kinds of texts. For instance if we take **Siddhanta Siromani of Bhaskara** -

  

It consists of four sections by names: Vyakta Ganita, Avyakta Ganitha, Grahaganita and Golaadhyaaya.

  

As the very names of these sections imply this text is essentially dealing with all mathematical aspects required to understand and appreciate Indian thoughts on Astronomy. Further these mathematical aspects are necessary even in all our day to day activities.

  

Interestingly these four names of the sections hint the readers a philosophic and cosmological theme and scheme of Bhaskara in his Siddhanta Siromani.

  

In the very benedictory stanza of the text Lilavati (The Anka Ganita Part of Bhaskara’s Magnum Opus Siddhanta Siromani) some terms used by the author reflect the philosophic interest of the writing.

  

प्रीतिं भक्तजनस्य यो जनयते विघ्नं विनिघ्नऩ् स्मृत-

स्तं वृन्दारकवृन्दवन्दितपदं नत्वा मतङ्गाननम्।

पाटीं सद् गणितस्य वच्मि चतुरप्रीतिप्रदां प्रस्फुटां

संक्षिप्ताक्षरकोमलामलपदैर्लालित्यलीलावतीम्॥

  

This is a benediction offered to Lord Vinghnesvara to remove all obstacles in the process of writing this text. Further the author calls this text (Lilavati) PAATI Ganita (Arithmetic) and wishes to present in skillful, pleasant and clear terms maintaining all brevity of expression and in very tender words as a Part of ***SAD GANITA***. Here the words ***PAATI*** and ***SAD-*** have something to say about the philosophic aspects of the theme.

  

**i) PAATI GANITHA **

Paati or Arithmetic is the Mathematics of countables. In this phenomenal world every physical thing is a countable. That counting can be species wise and individual wise. A careful observation of the contents of the text hints the readers that in every problem given here in this part is introduced through various living objects like birds or animals and various non living worldly objects. Hence it is here suggestive that everything in this phenomenal world is perceivable and whichever is perceivable is countable (VYAKTA). Hence this section brings all the perceivable entities in the world into the purview of GANITA or MATHEMATICS.



Now the word ***SAD-*** in the sloka can be contemplated up on for further understanding of the scheme. The word ***SAD-*** in Sanskrit means THE REALITY. From the philosophic point of view SAD or the CAUSE of the Universe alone is REAL and IMPERCEIVABLE and all the rest of the perceivable things are non-real. So he wants to say that the ANKA GANITA is a PART of SAD GANITA. Thus he brings ***SAD-*** also into the purview of GANITA or MATHEMATICS.



**ii) AVYAKTA GANITA or BIJA GANITA**

****

When the value of any entity is not known some value in the form of some syllables is assigned to it and through a particular process the value of it in numerical terms is arrived at finally. This kind of mathematics is called AVYAKTA GANITA as this section is meant for proving the value of something Unknown (AVYAKTA). In the process as some value in the form of syllable (BIJA) is temporarily assigned to it is also called BIJA GANITA.

****

If the name and process of this section is analyzed from philosophic and cosmological point of view this is inherently meant to deal with this ***SAD-*** in the Avyakta Ganita section of his text. ***SAD***- or AVYAKTA is the cause of the Universe. It is the UNMANIFEST and hence is called AVYAKTA. The GANITA part that deals with this AVYAKTA is called AVYAKTA GANITA. Its another name is BIJA GANITA. The word BIJA means the SEED or the CAUSE of the WORLD. Thus this section of the present text brings the UNMANIFEST CAUSE of the UNIVERSE also into the field of MATHEMATICS.

  

Similarly there is a lot to say about Graha Ganitha and Golaadhyaya of Siddhanta Siromani where many matters related to Trigonometry and Spherical Trigonometry are widely presented.

  

There is plethora of texts in our Ancient Vedic and Post Vedic Veidc - traditional texts on Indian Contribution to the field of Mathematics.

  

If this camp is aimed at to explain such matters there is nothing misleading but leading the younger generations only. 

  

With Warm Regards,
