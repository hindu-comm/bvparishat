Dear all!

Pranams.

This is in continuation to my last night's mail.

If I too can claim Mathematics among my domains of learning as per Shri HN Bhat Ji I would like to proceed further to say a few more things.

1\. No where in my first mail in this thread I stated that the word VEDIC MATHRIX is correct. Nor even I judged its incorrectness. The organizers will take care of explaining it.

  

2\. My concern in my first mail of this thread was to differentiate ANCIENT INDIAN MATHEMATICS from the VEDIC MATHEMATICS TEXT of Bharati Krishna Tirtha Swamiji. In my attempt to speak about this topic as observed by Shir HN Bhat there is a list of contents of the Workshop mentioned in my mail.

  

3\. Sir! HN Bhat Ji! It is not a list prepared by Sadasiva Murty. It is taken from the introductory brochure of the VEDIC MATHRIX 2016 as supplied by the organizers in their initial mail of this thread. For the convenience of the readers I am enclosing it with this mail again.

  

4\. To quote from Sri HN Bhat Ji - "which is his domain while Muurthyji has listed all the Ancient Mathematics, by the same title "*VedicMathrix*"- I state once again here that I haven't prepared any list of Ancient Mathematics and I haven't given it any title like - 'Vedic Mathrix" too.

The very title " *Vedic* *Mathrix*" doesn't seem to convey any of the content of the workshop listed by Mr.Murthy and it was taken as mean Vedic Mathematics by Mr. Mishra who is also master in Sanskrit as well as statistics. which is his domain while Muurthyji has listed all the Ancient Mathematics, by the same title " *Vedic* *Mathrix*". The title doesn't convey anything to me as I have not heard such word *Mathrix*.
