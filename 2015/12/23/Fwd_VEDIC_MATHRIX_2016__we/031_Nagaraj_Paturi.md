\>Checking other occurrences of “matrix” in South Indian publications may also enlighten us.



The technical term coined for contemporary Telugu medium writing of modern mathematics, for 'matrix' is మాత్రిక मात्रिक mātrika.



But the dental in this word is not on account of pronouncing 't' in 'matrix' as dental by the Telugu people. In fact, Telugu people, like their other south Indian counterparts,pronounce the 't' in 'matrix' as a very clear retroflex phone, sometimes overemphasizing theretroflex nature of that 't' ( so much that south Indian English pronunciation is often made fun of, exemplifying the overemphatic retroflex pronunciation of 't's and 'd's of English words).



The dental in మాత్రిక (mātrika) is with the intention ofgiving the word a native (Sanskrit-like) feel. (Something likeतकनीकfor technique in Hindi). This can be seen in other words like నత్రజని (natrajani) for Nitrogen. This is inspired by త్రి (tri) in త్రికోణమితి ( trikōṇamiti ) for trigonometrywhere the త్రి (tri) of Sanskrit for the English'tri' with its IE origin is a sound similarity borne out of genetic cognate relationship.



But natra for nitro etc are artificial (like and are not results of such तकनीकfor technique in Hindi ) and not results of any



genetic cognate relationship as in త్రికోణమితి ( trikōṇamiti ) for trigonometryor -jani for -gen etc.



The dental in మాత్రిక (mātrika) of Telugu for the English 'matrix' is also suchan attempt to give the word a native (Sanskrit-like) feel and not a result of pronunciation or hearing of 't' of matrix as dental.
