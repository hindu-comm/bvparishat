As said by Shri HN Bhat Ji if a person whose domain is relevant can speak in this context I believe my subjects may help me to consider my domain also is relevant to the context as per my degrees I acquired.

Here I would like to humbly mention some of my degrees I acquired through all the decades of my life journey so far.

**1. B.com (I had Mathematics and Statistics among my subjects)**

2. MA (Sanskrit)

3. MA (English)

**4. MA(Philosophy) - (Western Mathematical Logic was one of my subjects)**

5. Vedanta Vidyapraveena

6. PG Diploma in German

**7. Jyotisha Acharya (I studied Surya Siddhanta and othe astronomical Texts where mathetmatics is an integral part)**

8. Bharatiya Vidyavisharada

9. Certificate in Computing (Here Modern Mathematics is one of the Subjects)

**10. Discontinued MCA in my IV Sememster (in the year 2000 as I had to shift from Visakhapatnam to Tirupati to join in Rashtriya Sanskrit Vidya Peetha, Tirupati) . In MCA I had Mathematics in I and II Semesters while I discontinued in my IV Semester stage.**

11. Ph.D. **(As part of my study I went through the Binomial Theorem to observe howfar it has resemblance with the Shat Pratyayas of Pingala Naga**)

  

**12. NET in the year 1989 - (In the entire Andhra Pradesh I was the first Sanskrit student in the year 1989 to get qualified in UGC NET Examination where to take my general paper I studied Mathematical Logic)**

  

If my above qualifications make me mathematics my domain I shall proceed to say further many other things relevant to the thread.

Warm Regards,

**Dr. Rani Sadasiva Murty**

**Subject:** Re: {भारतीयविद्वत्परिषत्} Re: VEDIC MATHRIX 2016  

The very title " *Vedic* *Mathrix*" doesn't seem to convey any of the content of the workshop listed by Mr.Murthy and it was taken as mean Vedic Mathematics by Mr. Mishra who is also master in Sanskrit as well as statistics. which is his domain while Muurthyji has listed all the Ancient Mathematics, by the same title " *Vedic* *Mathrix*". The title doesn't convey anything to me as I have not heard such word *Mathrix*.
