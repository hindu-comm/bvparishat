Thanks Shankara Ji for the link. I am surprised how Dr. Kansara makes conclusions that unverified claims seems to be a solid facts to him based on just hearsay. On pages 4 and 5 of his paper, Dr. Kansara says it seems to him a solid fact that among other things, a German scholar acquired the manuscripts for 80,000 rupees in 1955-56.

  

Really? 80,000 rupees in 1955-56 would have been a very large sum of money. That would amount to tens of lakhs of rupees today. One can use the Consumer Price Index to get the precise number, a simple back of the envelope computation using annual inflation rates from the first table on [this](http://www.inflation.eu/inflation-rates/india/historic-inflation/cpi-inflation-india.aspx) page, I get an annualized inflation of 7.5% from 1958 to 2014 (quite believable), and using the same numbers 80,000 INR in 1958 comes out to be around 50 lakh rupees today. That is 75,000 US dollars to put it in perspective. Certainly the mysterious German scholar (who must have quite rich) did not pay by cheque, he must have paid in cash. I am curious where the scholar got this much money from? Certainly he did not exchange this amount in a bank (to avoid leaving a trace). Perhaps he robbed a bank in India or carried large amounts in Deutsche Marks and exchanged with a Hawala operator in India. And then the manuscripts were hidden by him forever, never to be published? I think the only things missing from this set of solid facts is the involvement of KGB, BND, Mossad, CIA, Stasi (and perhaps aliens) in this control of the elusive manuscripts for 16 volumes.
