My focus is specifically on the use of the word 'Vedic'.



'Veda text' can mean 'text of the Vedas'.



Are not certain Shastras called Vedic / Vaidika shastras as opposed to avaidika shastras ?



Are not certaintraditionscalled Vedic / Vaidikatraditions as opposed to avaidika traditions?



Can not we call texts of Vedic / Vaidika shastras or Vedic / Vaidikatraditions as Vedic / Vaidika texts in contrast to Veda texts or text of the Vedas?



Can or can not we call sulba sutras etc as Vedic mathematics ? if not , what do we call such books?
