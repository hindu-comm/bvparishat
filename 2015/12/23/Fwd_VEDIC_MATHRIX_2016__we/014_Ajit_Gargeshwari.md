The title of the '*Vedic* *Mathrix'* is meaningless. I have not heard the word *'Mathrix'*. Further questions can be directed to the organizers*.* One can ask the organizers directly as to what they mean by the term *Vedic* *Mathrix* if at all the word has any meaning and reflects on subjects that will be discussed*.* If the organizers are BVP members they can respond*.
