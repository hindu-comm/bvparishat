With apologies to Shefali Ji, I wish to state that the title of the camp is highly misleading and not expected from a reputed organization like CIF.

  

I have read parts of the original book on ‘Vedic Mathematics’ \[sic\] by Svāmī Bhāratī Kṛṣṇa Tīrtha in my school days and was \[also\] misled by the tall claims made in the book about the antiquity of this ‘science’. I even submitted a term project on ‘*Multiplication as Prescribed in the Vedas*’ \[sic\] in my ninth grade. Better read and much wiser now, I can assert this with confidence: **there is absolutely nothing that is ancient or Vedic in this so-called field of Vedic Mathematics**. India has had many real great mathematicians in the past, and she does not need fabricated and anachronistically dated Vedic Mathematics to confirm this. On the contrary, such fraudulent claims are an insult to India’s ancient mathematicians.



Here is a well-written paper discrediting the whole edifice of antiquity of Vedic Mathematics:

*A critical study of ‘Vedic mathematics’ of Śankaracārya Śrī Bhāratī Kṛṣṇa Tīrthajı Mahārāj*. Indian Journal of History of Science, 01/1999; 34(1), pp. 1–17. Link:

I am surprised a respected organization like CIF is associating with The School of Vedic Maths (SOVM) in propagating the myth that this is ancient Indian mathematics. And seems even the learned Svāmī Tejomayānanda has been taken for a ride, for in his benedictory letter calls Vedic Mathematics “a system that dates back to early India.” It does not date beyond the book by Svāmī Bhāratī Kṛṣṇa Tīrtha in 1950s.



The School of Vedic Maths (SOVM) is misleading people \[like the author of the original book\] by continuing to brand simplistic computation tricks as ‘Vedic Mathematics’ and claiming that they date back to ancient India. Highly questionableclaimsthat have been discredited are still propagated onthe SOVM's website (<http://sovm.org/what_is_vedic_maths.html>):



“It is during these times of deep meditations that he got inner revelations on the 16 Sutras from the Parisista (Appendix) of Atharva Veda. Thus he gave the declaration that any problem of Mathematics can be solved using these 16 Sutras.”



“When people asked how he discovered this new branch of knowledge, he humbly replied saying that it was already there in the Vedas. He just ‘re-discovered’ it.”



“At the request of his disciples, Swamiji wrote 16 elaborate volumes on the Sutras. Unfortunately, all of them were irretrievably lost and the huge loss was finally confirmed in the year 1956.”
