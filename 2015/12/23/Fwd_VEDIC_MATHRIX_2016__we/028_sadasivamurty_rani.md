Again I would like to draw the attention of all the scholars to the statement of Shri Nagaraj Paturi Ji who said in one of his mails:

  

***"It seems to be a f(p)un word created to suggest all these: Math+trix (Math+tricks), Matrix etc."***  

***  
***

This can be a kind of Acronym. An ACRONYM can be coined :

1.From the initial letters of some words of contextual importance:

 Ex: 1. UNESCO - United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural

                 Organization

     2. ASAP - As Soon As Possible

     3. WHO - World Health Organization

     4. LOL - Laughing Out Loud

     5. FYI - For Your Information

     6. TIA - Thanks In Advance

     7. RADAR - Radio Detecting And Ranging

  

2\. from the First Syllables (collection of letters) of two are more words

  Ex : 1. MODEM - Mo(dulator)/Dem(odulator)

      2. Bio(graphical) + data (Most of the dictionaries do not have this form in

        their word lists. Yet it is popular as a word though it is not a word)

     

There are hundreds of forms of this kind. Some are popular and some are in the process of becoming popular. Some are outdated too.

Which are popular are considered as words also such as: RADAR

  

**Similarly this might be an ACRONYM formed from : MATH (short form of MATHEMATICS as found in the Dictionaries) +Tricks changed into TRIX.**

  

Just as some words in SMS language do not have their regular spellings:

Ex. U = You Thanx = Thanks etc.

  

As said by Ajit Gargeswar Ji the organizers have been silent though a lengthy discussion has been in progress on this topic.

  

Let us hope that the organizers would speak.

  

Warm Regards to all,

**Dr. Rani Sadasiva Murty**
