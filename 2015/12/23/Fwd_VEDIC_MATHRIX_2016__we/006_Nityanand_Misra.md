Vedic is an English adjective listed in the Oxford dictionary and defined as "relating to the Veda or the Vedas". It is also listed as a noun, defined as "the language of the Vedas, an early form of Sanskrit". Vaidika is a Sanskrit word, not used in English. One has to bear this distinction in mind. Coming back to the question, the Baudhāyana Śulbasûtra-s (and other Śrautasūtras) are parts of Kalpa and are best called *Kalpa texts* or*Vedāṇga texts* and not *texts of Veda* or *Vedic texts*. At best, they may be called *texts in the tradition of the Vedas*, which is completely different. If we count everyVedāṇgatext as a Vedic text then even Aṣṭādhyāyī and Siddhāntakaumudī can be called Vedic texts as Vyākaraṇa is a Vedāngā. I would like to know if any \[traditional or modern\] reliable source counts Śulbasūtra as a "Vedic text".

  

Even if one were to ignore the terminology, is the five-day camp is really teaching Śulbasūtra-s or is it teaching the 20th century modern methods based on the Sutra-s and Upasutra-s from the book of Svāmī Bhāratī Kṛṣṇa Tīrtha Jī under the name of "Vedic Mathrix"? If the latter (as I suspect given SOVM's involvement) then it is misleading to call it Vedic Math\[rix\]. The term Vedic Math/Vedic Mathematics never existed before it was coined bySvāmījī. With due respect to his immense learning, it was a grossly misleading term which does great disservice to both Vedas and mathematics.Svāmījī's own admission that the Sutras were in a Parishishtha known to him and him alone when questioned by Prof. K S Shukla (who translated the Aryabhatiya into English) shows that he tried to brand his 20th century tricks as revelations from Vedas.
