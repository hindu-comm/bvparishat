I have heard from some scholars that the geometry of the altars recommended for the vedic rituals  

had something to do with the mapping of the sky. If this is the case, there should be methods of  

mathematical manipulations. While I would love to study the sky projections, I have not looked  

for the texts. There are some books on "Ancient Indian Mathematics" which narrate the contributions  

to point observations by medieval astronomers. Valmiki talks about cities, roads, chariots and warfare.  
These need mathematical work in engineering and mapping. So the research on the topic would have  
relevance. But to lump arbitrary stuff like the controversial book must be questioned.  

  

Given today is Christmas and we happen to live in foreign lands, I am sending you an image with  

light decoration of our home here. A man from Guatemala took initiative to do it in celebration  

of reunion with his two teen age sons after eleven years. The mathematics used is perceptual,  

but works with the limitations of our visual sensing.  
  

Merry Christmas and Happy New Year.
