HariH OM!

  

vidvabhyo namaskāraḥ ,

  

I wish to extend warm greetings to all for a very happy, prosperous and peaceful English New Year 2016.

  

While on this subject, I would like to know :

  

1. Whether we have recorded history of celebrating 'New Year' in our scriptures? Or, did it start only after the British colonial rule?

  

2. How our ancestors used to greet each other during New Year according to Hindu calendar?

  

3. Why do we Indians and Hindus specifically give prominence to January 1st as New Year and not to our Hindu traditional calendar? Is it because it is universal practice?

  

DhanyavadaH
