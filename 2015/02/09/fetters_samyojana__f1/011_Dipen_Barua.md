Dear all scholars,

  

Warmly greetings!

  

As far as I have understood the concept "fetters" (samyojana) in Buddhism has been developed from the Upanishadik concept "Paasha." Even the paasha word was used in two suttas(sutra-s), e.g., Marapasa, in early-phase of Buddhism. The Buddhist commentary has analysed the word "paasa" as defilement. But, the word was dropped in later period of Buddhism in terms of clarifying defilement, and instead of it other words have been developed, for example, samyojana.

  

Please could anyone share me any writings (books, or articles) on paasha?

  

Best,

Dipen
