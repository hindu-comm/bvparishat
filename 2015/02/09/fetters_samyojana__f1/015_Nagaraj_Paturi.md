Thanks Prof. RN Iyengar for bringing 'VaruNapaas'a' into discussion. Vedic VaruNapaas'a turned into the puranic varuNapaas'a later and it is depicted as the paas'a in the hands of Yama and his kinkaras. In visual representations, it is being depicted as a literal rope.



I think the Vedic varuNapaas'a has a cosmological sense and my hunch is that it has got to with something like gravitation there. The phrase 'varuNasya naabhih'occurs frequently in Rigveda and Yajurveda. At one of the places the earth is also described as varuNasya naabhih.



varuNasya paas'ah is also found in the veda.At some places the plural varuNasya paas'aah isalso found. Are these paas'aaah lines of gravitational force ? Descriptions stimulate such thinking.



But gradually,from the cosmological use of the wordssuch as varuNa, varuNasyanaabhih, varuNasya paas'ah/paas'aah etc. , vedanticideas of varuNa, varuNa paas'ah etc. seem to have taken lead.



In mahaanaaraayaNopanishadwe have :



वरुणस्य स्कम्भनमसि वरुणस्य स्कम्भसर्जनमसि  
उन्मुक्तो वरुणस्य पाशः १३  

Such usages probably are the leads for puraaNic varuNa paas'as in the hands of Yama and his kinkaras.



But the link of varuNapaas'as to paas'a as vedantic bandha needs to be more thoroughly studied.
