Namo vidvadbhyah

This term is used in Bauddhadarsanam (Divyaavadaanam) only, as far as I know.  
Bauddhas and Jainas do not borrow most of their terminology from Upanisats.  
You need not search Upanisats for this term in this sense.

Jainas use samsaara/kashaaya/bandha.

Fetters = worldly bindings.
