Dear Sir,

  

Please accept my warm regards. Once I asked you about the fetters (Pali. Samyojana), and you told me the "term" has not been shared in Upanishad, but shared "bond (bandha)". However, the term is also shared in Buddhism as we find there are four bonds namely; 1. Sensuality, 2. Existence, 3. Views, and 4. Ignorance.

  

Please could I know what does it mean in Upanishad, even in Jainism, and how many bonds are there?

  

It will be highly appreciated, if you to let me know about the bond in details.

  

Best regards,

Dipen
