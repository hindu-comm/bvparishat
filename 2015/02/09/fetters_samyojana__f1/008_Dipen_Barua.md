Dear all scholars,

  

Thank you very much for your clarification on the fetters and bonds. Some said "samyojana" is more equivalent to the Sanskrit word "Paasha". But I am hesitating how these two words shared same meaning, and how word "passha" derived.

  

In Buddhism, Samyojana is initially listed as *Tanhasamyojana, Nandisamyojana, and Bhavasamyojana*. Later on these are divided into many (standard scheme is ten fetters) which eradicated by the eight noble persons. In the early-phase of Buddhism "fetters" and "bonds" are elaborated separately, but in the Pali commentarial litterateurs it is said fetters is a type of synonym of bond, e.g., "bandhanattena samyojana" "tinnam samyojananti... tinnam bandhananam". However, I am still finding out why fetters and bonds are listed separately in early Buddhism.



I can read and write Sanskrit, though not expert in it. Please don't hesitate to share any Sanskrit materials.

  

Thank you very much for your cooperation!

Best,

Dipen
