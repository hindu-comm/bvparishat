I think the word संयोजन - as used a technical term in Pali texts, as mentioned byDipen Barua, but no more details of the sources is not given and it is hard to compare with other concepts like बन्ध in Upanishadic philosophical systems and Jain system. Just going by the similarity of बन्ध and "bond" in English, nothing could be achieved.

  

Each system of philosophy has its own concepts and technical terms used to denote those concepts. Prof. Nagaraj and Prof. Korada, have given the ideas prevalent in Jainishm and Vedanta Philosophy where similar terms are used. But to have a direct experience, one should go through some introductory English Books, like the Essentials of Indian Philosophy (Prof.Hiriyanna), or Six Systems of Indian Philosophy (, or History of Indian Philosophy (SD Gupta) or a reliable text Indian Philosophy by Dr.S.Radhakrishnan, to have an idea of the concepts in the Indian Philosophy. There are other books too in Sanskrit itself, like षड्दर्शनसंग्रहः of Haribhadra Suri, or सर्वदर्शनसंग्रह by Sayana Madhavacharya, which give the basic concepts of each Darshana (Sayana Madhava counts up to 16 Darsshana-s). All share the similar idea-s modified according to the tenets of the respective schools. Those in Sanskrit, need to have a deeper knowlege and experience of reading शास्त्र-s, than the reading practice in classical Sanskrit Literature. There are English Translations of these also available.

  

The Sutra-s quoted by the scholars is hard to digest, without the back ground of studies in Indian Philosophy either in Sanskrit or English.
