One fundamental question Vidwan Dipen Barua :



From the beginning of this thread, you have been using the English word 'fetters' for the Sanskrit/Pali word Samyojana, obviously on the basis of the widely prevalent English translation of the word Samyojana as 'fetters' . But the origin and historyof this translation needs to be traced because the English word 'fetters' means Bandha only and the originator of the translation 'fetters' for samyojana already equated samyojana with Bandha. It is this translation which is leading to many problems.



For example, your sentence "In the early-phase of Buddhism "fetters" and "bonds" are elaborated separately" probably meant In the early-phase of Buddhism "samyojana" and "bandha" are elaborated separately. Similarly, your sentence "but in the Pali commentarial litterateurs it is said fetters is a type of synonym of bond" also probablymeant "but in the Pali commentarial litterateurs it is saidsamyojana is a type of synonym of bandha'



Your question' why fetters and bonds are listed separately in early Buddhism' makes sense and sounds pertinent only when it is worded as
'whysamyojana andbandha are listed separately in early Buddhism'. Otherwise, considering fetters and bonds as synonymous to each other sounds obvious given the meaning of the word 'fetters'.



Please take care to use the word 'samyojana' only whenever and wherever you want to refer to that word , in stead of using the English word 'fetters' throughout the draft of your M Phil dissertation too.
