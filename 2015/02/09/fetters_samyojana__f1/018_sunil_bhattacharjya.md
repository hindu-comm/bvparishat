Namaste,  
  

The Pasha as used in "**Pashabadha iti pashu pashamukta Pashpati**" is
from an angle than from te angle of Dvatic Shaivism. The Pasha-mukta does not have any separate existence other than the Brahman. The Pasha-mukta stae is the Videhamukta-state and is oneness with the Brahman.  
  

Regards,
