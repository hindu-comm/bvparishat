Please can anybody help me to find out the usage of fetters (samyojana) in any of early Upanishadik texts, or Jain texts? This word was very much used in Buddhism. I would like to know how this word has been adopted in Buddhism to explain regarding the defilement/fetters in Buddhism.

  

This will be very much helpful if someone finds for me.
