Namaste,  
  

Can we say that he word Samyojana as quoted in Buddhism may be more equivalent to the Sanskrit word Paasha (पाश) ? One hears the statement **"paasha-baddha iti pashu, paasha-mukta pashupati**", from the Hindu scholars. An alternative statement is "**paasha-baddha iti jiva, paasha-mukta sadashiva**".
