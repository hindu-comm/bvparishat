This thread on "Fetters" is growing much more interesting with the participation of most of the senior scholars of BVP. 

Here I too would like to share a few of my views.

Regarding the use of "PASA" in Sri Lalita Sahasra Nama Stotra:

In the four hands of Goddess Lalita there are a sugarcane bow, Five Arrows,

A set of PASA (Snares) and an ANKUSHA (GOAD).

Here the two epithets were used in praise of Lalitamba. : RAGAPASA and KRODHAANKUSA.

Here the purpose of these PASAS in the hands of Mother Goddess is to pull out the AHANKARA and MAMAKARA (of which two RAGA (passion/possessiveness) is the product) of her devotees to universalize them and from the state of their being individuals.

Similar are the PASAS of VARUNA and YAMA as mentioned by Prof. RN Iyengar Garu and Prof. Nagaraj Paturi Garu.

In all these three instances 1. Pasas of Lalitamba 2. Varuna and 3. Yama they are snares (in the form of weapons) to pull out 1. RAGA and 2&3. LIVES respectively which are with in a BEING.

  

But the PASA mentioned in the SAIVISM as mentioned by SHRI HNBHAT Garu is A BINDING FACTOR.

This PASA binds the BEING to be born again and again till the last influence of KARMA is experienced having left no traces of it further to be freed from the bondage.

  

The other words often we come across as the synonyms of this PASA in various systems of philosophy and Stotras of BHAKTI Schools:

1\. AVIDYA in the VEDANTA.

2\. PRAKRTI and GUNAS in SANKHYA (The Three Strands which constitute the ROPE of PRAKRTI to bind Purushas) and in BHAGAVADGITA (where these are elaborated in the Gunatraya vibhaga yoga - sukhasangena badhnaati etc., )

(These Sankhya Gunas are not tendencies or attributes as often translated by many people. These are binding factors of JIVA)

3\. Bhava

4\. Samsara bandha

5\. Sankalpa pasa/bandha

6\. Bhavabandha

7\. Karmabandha/Karmapasa

(3,4,5,6,7 are often found in the Vedanta and Bhakti Stotras and in the puranas).

In all these instances and in other similar instances these terms refer to some binding factor which is the cause of rebirth of JIVA till his BALANCE of KARMA completely disappears leaving no traces of it.

8\. In the Sri Lakshmi Nrsimha Karvalamba Stotra there are some other metaphorical expressions to synonymise this concept are used.

*Bhavabhdi, Samsarakupa, Smasarasagara, Samsaravrksha, aghabijam, anantakarmasakham, Samsarasarpa,* *sarvendriyartha badisa* etc.,

The results of all these is to bind the JIVA to be born again n again till JIVA is ultimately relieved.

  

9\. In the Sankara bhashya of Upanishads while explaining the word UPANISHAD Sri Sankara Bhagavatpada gives three meanings to the verbal root *SHADL - visharana, gati and Avasadana*

*1. samsarabijasya visharana -destruction of the cause of samsara*

*2. brahma gamayati - helps to know BRAHMAN*

*3. samasarabandham sithilayati - Slackens the snares or fetters of SAMSARA.*

I take a pause here to take another opportunity to elaborate some more details about JAINISM, BUDDHISM and the analysis of the meanings of snares, fetters etc.

Warm regards,
