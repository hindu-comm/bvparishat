Dear Prof. Korada, Dr.H.N. Bhat and Prof M. Deshpande,



Thank you very much for explaining the term BhavinI SamjnA. In case of SaptamI Vibhakti, this is what I read the paper of another scholar--





"The relationship that saptamī vibhakti has to its meaning, as referred to by the word *artha* in the term saptamyarthe ( in 1.1.9) is not a contemporaneous one. The saptamī occurs subsequently in the hierarchy of levels. The meaning of saptamī are those for which the saptamī will subsequently occur, just as a *bhāvinī saṁjñā* is used for something that will arise in a subsequent derivational stage, Circularity is avoided because speech is nitya and its relationship to meaning is established."



In quoting this if any errors occur, they will belong to me. N.R.Joshi.

नमो विद्वद्भ्यः



What is the concept of Bhāvinī saṁjñā in connection with Panini grammar? (saptami vibhakti) --- Vidvan Joshi



Patanjali under निष्ठा (3-2-102) etc discusses this concept -



take a sentence like अस्य सूत्रस्य शाटकं वय (weave a शाटकम् with this thread ) -

here the question is - if it is a शाटकम् (already woven with thread) then it need not be woven , i e after weaving the thread only one calls it a शाटकम् ।



So in the sentence there is contradiction - if it is to be woven then it cannot be called a शाटकम् (which is in past) - if it is a शाटकम् then it need not be woven - शाटकम् and वातव्यम् - both are विप्रतिषिद्धम् ।



In such a situation भाविनी संज्ञा is meant , i e the speaker means - it is to be woven , which, when woven, would become शाटकम् --



भाष्यम् -



एवं तर्हि भाविनी संज्ञा विज्ञास्यते । तद्यथा कश्चित् कंचित् तन्तुवायम् आह - ’अस्य सूत्रस्य शाटकं वय ’ इति । स पश्यति -’ यदि शाटकः , न वातव्यः । अथ वातव्यः , न शाटकः । शाटकः वातव्यश्च इति विप्रतिषिद्धम् । भाविनी खल्वस्य संज्ञा अभिप्रेता । स मन्ये वातव्यः यस्मिन्नुते शाटक इत्येतद् भवति इति । एवम् इहापि तौ भूते काले भवतः ययोः अभिनिर्वृत्तयोः निष्ठा इत्येषा संज्ञा भविष्यति।



So what Patanjali is doing is following लौकिकवैदिकेषु कृतान्तेषु - here it is a usage in लोक and the same is followed in शास्त्रम् also .



(I did not get what is सप्तमी विभक्तिः)



धन्यो’स्मि
