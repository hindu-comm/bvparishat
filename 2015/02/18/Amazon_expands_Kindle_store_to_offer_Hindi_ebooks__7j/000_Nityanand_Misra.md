Good news for Indian readers and publishers. Since Feb 13, the Kindle store is offering ebooks in Hindi. No major news splash around this, and I got to know this from some obscure sources

As of now, 87 Hindi books are being offered under [this link](http://www.amazon.com/gp/search/ref=sr_nr_n_8?fst=as%3Aoff&rh=n%3A133140011%2Cn%3A%21133141011%2Cn%3A154606011%2Cn%3A7735160011%2Cn%3A7738934011%2Cn%3A7763491011&bbn=7738934011&ie=UTF8&qid=1424251879&rnid=7738934011) (one may also navigate to this page by choosing Hindi under Foreign languages).

  

Surprisingly, Hindi is still not listed in the list of supported languages in Kindle Direct Publishing.

Now waiting for Sanskrit ebooks on Kindle. And a good Nagari font in Kindle.
