In addition to marriage with a Sagotra, marriage with a Sapiṇḍa is also not allowed by Śāstra.

As per Yājñavalkya (YS 1.3.2)  

अविप्लुतब्रह्मचर्यो लक्षण्यां स्त्रियमुद्वहेत्।

अनन्यपूर्विकां कान्तामसपिण्डां यवीयसीम्॥

And as per Manu (MS 3.5)  

असपिण्डा च या मातुरसगोत्रा च या पितुः।

सा प्रशस्ता द्विजातीनां दारकर्मणि मैथुने॥

Despite this, there are some communities in India which traditionally allowed marriages with Sapiṇḍa. It is for this reason that the Hindu Marriage Act has an exception clause.  

<http://bokakhat.gov.in/pdf/The_hindu_marriage_act.pdf>  

A Sapinda relationship as per the Hindu Marriage Act is  

(f)(i)"Sapinda relationship" with reference to any person extends as far as the third generation(inclusive) in the line of ascent through the mother, and the fifth (inclusive) in the line of ascent through the father, the line being traced upwards in each case from the person concerned, who is to be counted as the first generation;  

(ii) two persons are said to be "sapinda" of each other if one is a lineal ascendant of the other within the limits of sapinda relationship, or if they have a common lineal ascendant who is within the limits of sapinda relationship with reference to each of them;

As per the same act, oen of the conditions of marriage is  

(v) the parties are not sapindas of each other, unless the custom or usage governing each of them permits of a marriage between the two;
