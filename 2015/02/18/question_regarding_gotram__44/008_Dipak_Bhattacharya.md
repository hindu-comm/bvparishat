The authentic list of Gotras will be found in the final chapter of the Baudhāyana-Śrautasūtra.

An updated list will be found in Puruṣottama-Paṇḍita’s Gotrapravaramañjarī. This was critically edited and translated into English with a detailed Introduction by J.Brough and published by the Cambridge University Press in 1953.

According to the Śāstras the Gotras are families of sages known as founders of the gotras and hence these are exogamous groups. The Baudhāyana ŚS rules that one should not marry into one’s own gotra which was considered incest in Hindu society.

The Indian Constitution does not recognize Gotra exogamy. The Government regard steps taken by Panchayets against intra-gotra marriage as criminal act.
