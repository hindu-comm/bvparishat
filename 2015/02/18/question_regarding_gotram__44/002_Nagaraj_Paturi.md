Without any dispute with the enlightenment provided by Prof. Korada, let me add the following details with the assumption that the curious youngster must be looking for such information :



1\. Gotra is an exogamous social group in the sense that a person belonging to (born in) a certain gotra does not marry a person belonging to (born in) the same gotra. Exogamous social grouping is widespread all over the world so much so that it is considered sometimes to be one of the cultural universals. Cultural anthropologists use the word 'clan' to describe/categorize such social groups. This norm of exogamy is based on the idea that persons belonging to the same clan have a common ancestor. Gotra is similar to clan in this respect too. Persons belonging to the same gotra are believed to have a common ancestor. For Brahmins, this common ancestor is a rishi. That is the reason, among Brahmins, gotras are named after a rishi (who is considered to be the common ancestor of all the persons belonging to that gotra )



2\. Gotra is a patrilineal notion in thesense that the gotra of a male remains the same as at the time of his birth whereas the gotra of a female changes into the gotra of her spouse after her marriage. Most of the clans all over the world are patrilineal only. This isbecause most of the societies all over the world are patrilineal.



3\. Gotra has a greater significance in the Vedic tradition because of the significance for the notions of pitr devas, pitr loka etc. , rituals such as shraaddha karmas etc., notions of benefits accrued by the pitr devatas of a gotra by the puNya karmas of a person born in that gotra and so on.As such, identity of a person for all Vedic lifestyle and Vedic ritual purposes is centred around that person's gotra only.



4\. In India,many non-Brahmin castes maintain the memory of a clan-like social group and invariably borrow the word gotra from thebrahmanical vocabulary to describe their clan identity. For example, during temple worship, during marriage rituals etc., whenever gotra is required to bementioned as part of Vedic rituals, all Hindus mention their 'clan' name as the gotra name, though these names are not usually the names of any rishis.
