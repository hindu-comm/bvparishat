The Indian Constitution does not recognize Gotra exogamy. The Government regard steps taken by Panchayets against intra-gotra marriage as criminal act.



-------What was considered as criminal act was 'killing' but not the norm of exogamy.



Indian constitution allows local village or caste panchayats to settle disputes as long as such dispute settlements do not lead to acts that come in the way of fundamental rights of the Indian citizens. In the case of Manoj- Babli honour killing case, the judgement was focussed on killing of the citizens but not on the validity of the exogamy norm.
