In general, gotra denotes any person who traces descent in an unbroken male line from a common male ancestor. Panini defines gotra for grammatical purposes as apatyaṃ pautra-prabhr̥ti gotram (IV. 1. 162), which means 'the word gotra denotes the progeny (of a sage) beginning with the son's son. Gotra is an exogamous (septs) patrilineal sibship whose members trace their descent to a common ancestor. “The early Brahminical system of Gotra and Pravara”, Brough, John, Cambridge, 1953  
  
In Atharva Veda, it referred to a clan. All are believed to have descended from one or the other of the Rishis who lent their names to the various Gotras. Thus, Gotra signifies one family or one’s lineage  
  
When a person says ' I am Kashypasa-gotra' he means that he traces his descent from the ancient sage Kashyapa by unbroken male descent. According to the BaudhÃyana srauta-sutra Visvamitra, Jamadagni, Bharadvaja, Gautama, Atri, Vasishtha, Kashyapa and Agastya are 8 sages; the progeny of these eight sages is declared to be gotras. This enumeration of eight primary gotras seems to have been known to Panini. The offspring (apatya) of these eight are gotras and others than these are called ' gotrasvayava '.  
  
The gotras are arranged in groups, there are according to the Asvalayana Srautasutra four subdivisions of the Vasishtha gana, viz. Upamanyu, Parashara, Kundina and Vasishtha other than the first three. Each of these four again has numerous sub-sections, each being called gotra. So the arrangement is first into ganas, then into pakshas, then into individual gotras. The first has survived in the Bhrigu and Ängirasa gana. According to Baud, the principal eight gotras were divided into pakshas. The pravara of Upamanyu is Vasishtha, Bharadvasu, Indrapramada; the pravara of the ParÃ¢shara gotra is Vasishtha, ShÃ¢ktya, PÃ¢rÃ¢sharya; the pravara of the Kundina gotra is Vasishtha, MaitrÃ¢varuna, Kaundinya and the pravara of Vasishthas other than these three is simply Vasishtha. It is therefore that some define pravara as the group of sages that distinguishes the founder (lit. the starter) of one gotra from another.  
  
There are two kinds of pravaras, 1) sishya-prasishya-rishi-parampara, and 2) putrparampara. Gotrapravaras can be ekarsheya, dwarsheya, triarsheya, pancharsheya, saptarsheya, and up to 19 rishis. Kashyapasa gotra has at least two distinct pravaras in Andhra Pradesh: one with three sages (triarsheya pravara) and the other with seven sages (saptarsheya pravara). This pravara may be either sishya-prasishya-rishi-parampara or putraparampara.
