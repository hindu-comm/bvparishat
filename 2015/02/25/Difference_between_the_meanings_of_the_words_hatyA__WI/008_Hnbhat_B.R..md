The reverse is the question. Though there is no distinction of meaning, than killing, the word हत्या is always used as उत्तरपद, and not isoloated, in classical literature. (But in Vedic Literature, it is seen used as independently without any उपपद). But वध could be used independently or in compound, and there is no restriction for being used as an उत्तरपद. This seems to have made the distinction.

  

वृत्रवध or वृत्रस्य वधः, but हत्या could be used in compound only, as the word itself is derived with an उपपद, in classical literature. Whether the killing of वृत्र is right or wrong is a different thing. It was wrong as considered as ब्रह्महत्या and Indra by slaying him, Indra got the sin of ब्रह्महत्या. As a demon, he had to be killed, so it was needed for maintaining the law and order of the heavenly rule. Grammatically, हत्या is used with selected words only, as per "हनस्त च" (३।१।१०८) with the suffix क्यप् according to the usage :ब्रहमहत्या। अश्वहत्या etc.

"हनश्च वधः ३।३।७६" derives the word from the same root with a different suffix, but need not उपपद with another noun or any prefix. Both have भावप्रत्यय.  

वधश्चोराणाम्। वधो दस्यूनाम्।  

  

कंसवधमाचष्टे - कंसं घातयति is a special case, where कंसवध is the episode of killing of कंस and not the real killing of कंस. So im भीष्मवध etc. also it could mean the chapter episode of the killing of भीष्म etc. the name of the पर्व in which the episode of भीष्मवध is described.
