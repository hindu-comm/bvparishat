I am sorry to have responded to a digressing portion of a thread on an interesting topic of Sanskrit semantics.



Vidwan Saleelji's observation on the contemporary connotational difference between the two words was the starting point.



1\. One caution was to see if the difference is found in the usagesincontemporaryIndian languages other than Sanskrit or in Sanskrit also.



2\. Second caution was not to come to a conclusion without exhausting observations in Sanskrit literature (Prof. Korada)



Regards,



Nagaraj
