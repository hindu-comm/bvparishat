As far as I can tell, the semantic difference between han- and vadh- seem to have developed in late Sanskrit/Prakrit and some modern languages. Pāṇini's rules "ano vadha luṅi, liṅi ca" give no indication that he perceived any semantic difference, but that the suppletive relationship is like as \<---> bhū. On the other hand, in the later literature, a semantic difference seems to appear, but not consistently. This is why the question of whether Mahatma Gandhi's killing by Godse was a vadha or hattyā has remained a burning debate, depending upon whether one considers it as a legitimate act or a murder. That sort of distinction in meaning is difficult to detect in the older Sanskrit literature.
