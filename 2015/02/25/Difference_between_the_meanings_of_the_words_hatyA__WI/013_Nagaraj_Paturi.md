It seems that after hearing what Nathuram Godse said in his defence, one of the judges admitted that had the case been heard by a jury he could probably have been acquitted.

\- Hearsay? or any documentation?



Which law acquits a person accused of killing another person unless killing is not proved? Did Godse according to this story plead that he did not kill Gandhi? Or, did he plead that the death of Gandhi was an accidental happening in which his involvement was unintentional?
