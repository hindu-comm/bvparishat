I did not follow all the postings, so the following might have been brought to notice by some. This is to draw attention to निधन *nidhan* in the sense of death in Hindi.It means non-natural death in Bengali. When one dies in bed because of illness it is not stated as *nidhan*. One dying in accident or in a shoot out is said to be *nihata*. I vaguely remember of Jayprakas Narayan's death being reported as *nidhan* in 1979. That raised eyebrows in Bengal.
