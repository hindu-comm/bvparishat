Vidwan Saleel Kulkarniji,



You are right. Hatyaa is being used for wrong killings. Vadha is being used for legitimate killings.



Prof. Deshpande is clarifying that this connotational difference between these two wordsappears to have evolved over a period of time. Originally there probably was no denotational difference between the two words.



But the example provided by Prof. Deshpande is not a healthy one at least as per my sensibilities.Killing of Mahatma Gandhiby Godse cannot be argued to be a legitimate act from any perspective. The word vadha is being used for killings which are considered asduShTas'ikShaNa. How can the killing of Mahatma Gandhi be argued as belonging to that category? (Probably Prof. Deshpande wanted to say that Godse and his supporters might considerkilling of Gandhi to be a vadha. )



One suitable example could be controversies about police encounters. Those killings by the police that are considered by their department to be vadha might be viewed as their adversaries to be hatyaa.
