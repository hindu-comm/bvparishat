Namo namah,



Let us keep aside the recent controversial examples such as गान्धिहत्या. But in the older traditions, have there been any instances when an illegitimate, immoral, unethical killing of a particular person named XXX is referred to as XXXXहत्या? Or there also it is referred as XXXXवध?



In older literature usually the heroes killed the villains and heroes never died in the war. So it may be difficult to find such examples. But are there any such at all? I am just curious to know if the usage of the two words (हत्या and वध) when compounded with a proper noun differ depending on the righteousness of the act.



Thank you.
