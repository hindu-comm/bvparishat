It is interesting to note the fluidity of usage across time and across languages. Gopal Godse's original Marathi book was titled "गांधीहत्या आणि मी", but its Hindi translation that is circulating is titled "गांधीवध और मैं". On the internet, one would find many discussions about whether what Godse did was a (legitimate) vadha, or a random killing (hattyā), cf. "mahatmagandikihatyanahi huyi thi 'vadh' hua tha". This demonstrates that at least in the late Indo-Aryan languages, some sort of distinction in meaning is being perceived between these two words, a distinction that is not apparent to Pāṇini. The common Vedic expressions are dasyuhattyā and vṛtrahattyā, the latter coexisting with statements like indro vṛtram avadhīt. The semantic divergence needs to be traced by meticulously checking the usage of these words, and their chronology.
