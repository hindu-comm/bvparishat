Namaste,  
  
To my knowledge Godse did not plead for acquittal, nor he hated Gandhiji. He told the judges what made him act the way he did, though he had great regards for Gandhiji. I understand that he did pranaam to Gandhiji before killing him. That judge probably made the comment as he was moved by the speech of Godse.
