Exactly the question was whether any proper noun is followed by the word हत्या than the word वध which is seen preceded by a proper name as in जयद्रथवध, etc. and हत्या is not seen preceded by any proper name, like जयद्रथहत्या.

  

The semantic difference was a side question later discussed in this thread, which lead around the semantic difference exists as legitimate and illegitimate. But not examining more approved by examples, the difference was established. Now in this case at least, there is no difference as none of these two are preceded by any proper name either. वध can be preceded by any noun or proper noun, but the difference seems to be हत्या does not follow any proper noun. That was one point raised by the first question and is it because of the difference in their meaning as a side question. Now the examples are wanting, any proper name followed by the word हत्या to come to any conclusion about the observation. So far, वध is seen following proper name or any noun, and हत्या is not seen following any proper name. The examples should be collected from the literature. I could not find any instance in the search results in the गवेषिका search engine, other than गोहत्या, भ्रूणहत्या etc. any pronoun followed by any proper name in the online collections, Gretil and others included in the seach Engine. but वृत्रहत्या is seen once.
