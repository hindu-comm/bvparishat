Respected Prof. Korada,

Thank you very much for the information.

{{ It is difficult to rule that the terms are employed in different contexts.}}

Quite true. But it is seen that in the case of a compound with a proper noun as the पूर्वपदम्‌, the उत्तरपदम्‌ can be the word वध but never हत्या. E.g. Words such as भीष्मवधः, शिशुपापवधः, अभिमन्युवधः are seen but not the words like भीष्महत्या, शिशुपालहत्या, अभिमन्युहत्या.

Am I right?
