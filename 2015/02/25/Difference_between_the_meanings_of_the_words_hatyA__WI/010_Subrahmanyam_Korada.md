नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

Quite true. But it is seen thatin the case of a compound with a proper noun as theपूर्वपदम्‌, theउत्तरपदम्‌can be the wordवधbut neverहत्या. E.g. Words such asभीष्मवधः,शिशुपापवधः,अभिमन्युवधःare seen but not the words likeभीष्महत्या,शिशुपालहत्या,अभिमन्युहत्या.

Am I right?

Yes, you are right - in most of the cases we hear the पूर्वपदम् to be a proper noun . The only problem is there is no waterline as far as my experience goes to suggest what you have in mind .

In fact, I observed this phenomenon some time ago but to give a ruling, I rather think , we have to check with more literature.

पदमञ्जरी says there is a separate धातु - वध । In any case it is not as clear as it is in English -

assassination = political killing(If I am Assassinated - late Bhutto)

culling = birds etc due to flu

murder = for gain etc

killing= general (accident, war etc)

The guideline is - अस्त्यप्रयुक्तः इति साहसमात्रमेव

So I suggest you may work more on this subject.

धन्यो’स्मि
