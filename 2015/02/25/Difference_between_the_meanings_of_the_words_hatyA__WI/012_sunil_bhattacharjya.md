Namaste,  
  

Can we not say that वध is the killing which can be considered unavoidable and in that sense legitimate? Sishupala had to be killed as he did not care for the innumerable warnings given to him. Bhishma had to be killed as he was under obligation to give protection to the Kauravas, irrespective of any merit inalready that. Abhimanyu too had to be killed and he had in reality no escape from the Chakravyuha as he did not know how to come out of that. As regards the moral aspect that was alteady set aside by the Pandavas themselves by using Shikhandin for killing Bhashma.  
  
  
On the other hand हत्या is avoidable killing and in that sense illegitimate. Killing of a cow for food is definitely avoidable.  
  

As regards which term should be used for the unfortunate killing of Gandhiji is a very difficult issue and depends on the perspective. It seems that after hearing what Nathuram Godse said in his defence, one of the judges admitted that had the case been heard by a jury he could probably have been acquitted.
