Vāsiṣṭhadharmaśāstra 28.7 says: trīṇi striyaḥ pātakāni ... bhartṛvadho bhrūṇahattyā svasya garbhasya pātanam. In such old usages, there seem to be no difference in meaning between vadha and hattyā, a situation that seems to agree with Pāṇini's understanding. On the other hand, as we have discussed in earlier exchanges, a difference in meaning seems to emerge in late Sanskrit and Prakrit languages, including modern languages.
