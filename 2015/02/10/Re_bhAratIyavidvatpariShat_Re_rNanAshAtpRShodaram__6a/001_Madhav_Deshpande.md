Dear Dr. Joshi,

  

  Varṇaviparyaya "transposing of varṇas" is a traditional term going back to works like the Nirukta of Yāska. Such cases are found in the derivations offered by Yāska and others. For instance, "siṃha" is derived from the root "hiṃs", and the word "tarku" is derived from the root "kṛt". These are not historical etymologies in the sense of modern linguistics, but ancient conjectures. The term "metathesis" in modern linguistics refers to a similar transposition of sounds, but instances of "metathesis" in modern sense of the word need more historical justification. For instance, consonant clusters in Sanskrit that begin with h in Sanskrit, -hm-, -hy-, -hr-, -hv- etc. undergo metathesis in Prakrit languages. For example, Sanskrit guhya becomes Pali guyha, or Sanskrit snāpaka becomes nahāpaka in Pali, with the change of s>h. Such instances of metathesis have better historical justification, compared to the traditional derivation of siṃha from the root hiṃs. I hope this clarifies the difference in the traditional and modern usage of these terms. Best,
