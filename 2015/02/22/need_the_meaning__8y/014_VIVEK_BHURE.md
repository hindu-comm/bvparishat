Namstey to all scholars!  
  
My question to nagarajpaturi Sir-  

  
I think there were many such borrowings into modernSanskrit even earlier. The method and manner followed in earlier cases should be the guiding principle here for a consistent borrowing policy to form for Sanskrit.  

  

Sir, can you please elaborate on this ? And what manner in borrowing was followed in the examples encountered by you?  
(I am just saying this) Can we not treat केक as a-karant nueter word (like in English: nueter because non-living entity) and use it like वनम् word.  
Proper standard rules should be created so that uniform borrowings can be done (if at all required).  
Thanks in advance.
