Who asked you to decline an English Word in Sanskrit as in English? Have you heard borrowing of words from another language? In other words, there is no word as केक in Sanskrit Language, itself. It is just a bold guesture by Prof.Nagaraj that it could be meaning cake in English, taking the essay on birthday celebration. In modern days, it is a fashon to cut cakes and sing Happy Birth Day, putting off the candles, imitating Christian custom. If this is referred to be the compound word, as आधुनिकीं रीतिं विहाय, then it is possibly a word meaning "the cake cutting" as in the modern day celebrations. That is a coined word borrowed from English for the purpose of criticizing the modern birthday celebrations. Otherwise there is no context for cake-cutting. You have not give the topic of the Essay, but said only it is an exercise for essay writing. This all in the mind when Nagaraj remarked. So केक is not an original Sanskrit Language word, but borrowed for the use in the Sanskrit Essay provided it is an essay on Birthday and the present context as explained above, referring to it as part of the modern way (of celebration) for criticizing it. There is no common rule for borrowing words from other languages, as it is not in the classical literature now recognizable and now the trend is to reverse the process if any. *JUST like केक means cake in English.* If it is borrowed, you can make it sanskritized than using as हलन्त - of "cake" (pronounced in English as "kek" केक्. Is there any rule the English Spelling should be adopted or the English pronounciation should be adopted in a borrowed word? The other way, one can easily claim that it was borrowed from Sanskrit to English.

  

Scholars could express their views. In my view, it is an essay on a modern topic as Birthday celebration or जन्मदिनोत्सवः, unless it is specified in the exercise in the text.
