Respected scholars,

thank you so much for all the scholars who helped me out.would you mind to discuss again here.....aboutकेककृन्तनtopic?

  

केकmeans cake inEnglish?कृन्तन means cutting. then how to pronunceकेक? because we spellकेक् in english. if we take this word exactly into Sanskrit it should be likeकेक्!! Could you spare a moment on this topic?

thanks in advance..if it is not a worthy one.. i apologize.
