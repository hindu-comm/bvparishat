That केक could be cake and कृन्त could be cutting was a suggestion from Prof. Ashok Aklujkar. I just seconded the proposal. All the credit being given byDr H N Bhat for being able to recognise the possibility of borrowings from English into Sanskrit, in fact,goes to Prof. Aklujkar.




aayushmatee Sree Latha's question is :



then how to pronunceकेक? because we spellकेक् in english. if we take this word exactly into Sanskrit it should be likeकेक्!! Could you spare a moment on this topic?



She says:



if it is not a worthy one.. i apologize.



Aayushmatee Sree Latha, your question is a really good question. The author of thesource that you quoted (The CBSE

lesson/exercise) should answer your question- whether that person wants to take the word केक as ajanta or halanta. When artha that is theentity/concept denoted by a s'abda (word) is not from the culture of the language in which you want to represent the entity/concept, it is quite naturalthat there would not beany s'abda for that artha in that language. In such a situation borrowing the foreign word is the only option left.In such a situation, questions such as the ones you raised ( whether to treat the word ashalanta or ajanta)become pertinent only.



I think there were many such borrowings into modernSanskrit even earlier. The method and manner followed in earlier cases should be the guiding principle here for a consistent borrowing policy to form for Sanskrit.



It is certainly a good topic to discuss.
