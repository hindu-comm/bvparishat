Probably you have not understood any better, than your first question. It is not "ShabdasyAshabda" any meaningful unit in the sentence, by splitting it wrongly in the middle of a compound. But as they are two separated clauses, in the sUtra style,'"ShabdasyAshabda" does not mean itself mean anything.

  

स्वं रूपं शब्दस्य, अशब्दसंज्ञा is the second part, excepting the second from the application of the first part statement, which itself is a self sufficient compound unit. and no as you have repeated as "shabdasyaashabda".
