Dear Dr. Joshi,

  

  The chronological order of Yāska and Pāṇini is highly contested in the research literature, but they must be very close to each other, though belonging to different śāstras. Pāṇini quotes Śaunaka, Śākalya, Śākaṭāyana, and Gārgya. So they can be treated as being pre-Pāṇinian.
Yāska also quotes Śākaṭāyana and Gārgya. Vyāḍi appears to be between Pāṇini and Kātyāyana. Upavarṣa is quoted by Śabara, but not by any of the earlier authors, and could be relatively later. The relative chronology of Jaimini is unclear, as Jaimini is not quoted by Pāṇini, Yāska or Patañjali. If I remember correctly, Patañjali knows the Mīmāṃsā of Āpiśali and Kāśakṛṭsna, but not that of Jaimini. The relationship of Jaimini and Bādarāyaṇa is also complicated, as both seem to quote each other. Their relationship has been a subject of recent debates. This is approximately what we know about the relative chronology of these early authors. For detailed discussions and differences of opinions, you can consult the comprehensive bibliography of research published by my guruji, Professor George Cardona. With best wishes,
