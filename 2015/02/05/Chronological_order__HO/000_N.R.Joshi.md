Respected scholars Namaskar!



May I get a littlehelp from schholars of this list please in setting chronological order of the ancient scholars in Indian Philosophy and Graamar?



. On BVP postings I come across the names Vyaadi (Sangraha) Jaimini of Purvamimamsa Badarayan of Brahmasutra, Shaunaka of Brihat devata, Shakalya of Pada patha, Nirukta (Yaaska), Shaakatayana, Gaargya, Upavarsha, Panini, Katyayana, and Patanjali of Mahabhasya).



Assuming Patanjali around 150 BC, is it possible to arrange the other authors in a chronological order? Approximate timing is ok so that I get some idea which author (or his work )preceded which. Right now the picture is not clear in my mind. Thanks. N.R.Joshi
