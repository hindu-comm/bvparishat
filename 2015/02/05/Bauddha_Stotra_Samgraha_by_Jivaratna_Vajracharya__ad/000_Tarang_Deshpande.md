Respected Group Members,

  

Previously I had put a query regarding the book Bauddha Stotra Samgraha by Motilal Banarsidass, to which many of the group members guided me properly.  

  

Then recently I came to know about a book named Bauddha Stotra Samgraha which contains 176 stotras on 71 deities of Tantric Buddhism which were collected by Jivaratna Vajracharya. Is this book available with anyone? Does any one have this book, either in pdf format or xerox copy?

  

I request quite humbly to share this book wit me or the group if any one has it.

  

  

Thanking You,

  

Yours faithfully,

  

Tarang Deshpande.
