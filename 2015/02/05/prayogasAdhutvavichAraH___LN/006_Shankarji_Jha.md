The question was whether the usage शुक्लो रूपम् is correct or not. It depends whether it is used as उद्देश्यविधेयभाव or विशेषणविशेष्यभाव, that counts for the justification of the usage. In the second, it takes the concordance of genders of adjective and qualified noun and in the second, each take their own gender. Hence the question raised.
