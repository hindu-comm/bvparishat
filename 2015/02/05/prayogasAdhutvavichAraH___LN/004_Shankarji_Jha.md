Special interpretation here I have come across---" words conveying colours Shukla etc( Nila, Pita and so on) has two meanings: Guna and Guni both in the tenet of Vaiakaranas(grammarians) on the basis of the proof of referred (mentioned) Koshas (Grammarians hold authority in Koshas), but it in not in the tenet of Naiyayikas(Logicians). According to Naiyayikas---the words Nila, Pita etc convey the meanig of Guni through Laksana where the main primary meaning of the word is Guna alone. Naiyayikas do not take authority of Koshas.
