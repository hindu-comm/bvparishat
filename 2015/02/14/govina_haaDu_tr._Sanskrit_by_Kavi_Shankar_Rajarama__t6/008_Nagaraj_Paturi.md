The kannada version has the rhythm:



3+4, 3+4



3+4, 3+4



3+4, 3+4



3+4 , 4



The second half of the fourth paada being 4 in stead of 3+4 is the salient feature.



The 4s in most of the lines are coming from the elongation through singing.



Vidvatkavi Sri Shankar Rajaraman maintained the 3+4 , 3+4 pattern in all the first three lines in every stanza,in most placeswithout any need to elongate through singing.



The second half of the fourth line has 5 inthe Sanskrit version.
