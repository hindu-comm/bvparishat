But what I had learnt by heart from my text books is like this only:

  

ಎನ್ನ ಒಡಹುಟ್ಟಕ್ಕ ನೀನು

ನಿನ್ನ ಕೊಂದು ಏನ ಪಡೆವೆನು?

ಎನ್ನುತ ಹುಲಿ ಹಾರಿ ನೆಗೆದು

ತನ್ನ ಪ್ರಾಣವ ಬಿಟ್ಟಿತು

ಸತ್ಯವೇ ಭಗವಂತನೆಂಬ ಪುಣ್ಯಕೋಟಿಯ ಕತೆಯಿದು

  

without the last line. The version in viki pages is too much elaborated and the one in this blogspot is nearer to what I had learnt by heart:

I have also the same question, if the story is from Padmapurana, as you had mentioned, the original reference to Padmapurana could be please located.
