The much longer account (in two hundred verses) is to be found in the eighteenth chapter of Sṛṣṭi Khaṇḍa in the Padmapurāṇa. When asked by Sūta how the river Sarasvatī came to be known as Nandā. Pulastya then narrates the account of the king Prabhañjana who once killed a breast-feeding doe. The king was cursed to be a meat-eating tiger for a hundred years, and told that he would be liberated from the curse by the effect of a conversation with a cow named Nandā. At the end of Nandā's conversation with the tiger, the tiger again becomes Prabhañjana. Dharma then manifests and says that henceforth, the river Sarasvatī flowing in that forest will be known as Nandā.  
  
The tiger does not turn into Dharma in the Padmapurāṇa.  
  
Refer pages 229 to 243 in the MUM publication of the Padmapurāṇa under <http://is1.mum.edu/vedicreserve/puranas/padma_purana_1srishti.pdf>
