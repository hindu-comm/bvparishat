Dear Shreevatsa,  
  

Thanks a lot for posting this beautiful translation (select-verses from the heart touching saga of puNyakOTi) of our good friend and gifted poet Dr. Shankar Rajaraman. I wish to bring to the kind notice of the learned members of BVP that a great scholar and natural poet Vid Bommalaapura Venkataraama Bhatta of Bangalore, who is no more now, had also translated this long poem completely, a khanDakaavya in Kannada of high merit in to Sanskrit before thirty five years and this was serialized in the famous Sanskrit Daily Sudharmaa. I hope scholar friends like Dr. S Jagannath would help in getting this. Late Venkataraama Bhatta has written many short and long poems, both original and translations. Unfortunately many are not published. He has successfully adopted the Kannada metres like bhaamini ShaTpadi, pallava (the name original metre of this puNyakOTi song) and others in to Sanskrit. His wonderful translation of Manakkutimmana Kagga, a classic of modern Kannada, penned by the Doyen of Kannada literature DVG, which just missed the first ever jnana peeTha award due to several non literary measures, is in over eight hundred vasanta-tilaka verses. Even this has not seen the light of the day.

I also thank Prof.Aklujkar for reminding about the wonderful work of art by Our National Professor and great novelist Dr. S L Bhairappa. The original novel in Kannada, tabbaliyu neenaade magane has been faithfully translated into Sanskrit by Vid> GuNDmi GaNapayya HoLLa in the name "anaathO'si". Samskrita bhaarati has published this. Like the Hindi Film gOdhUli, even in Kannada an award winning film "Tabaliyu neenaade magane" is produced and this was very well received too.  
  

regards
