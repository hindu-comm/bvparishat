Dear all,  
  

A scholar, who is not a member of BVP wanted to know the etymology and meaning of the following three words:  
  
Dravya (द्रव्य), Manushya (मनुष्य) & Nirodha (निरोध)  
  
He writes:  
  
निरोध is translated variously as: *prevention, covering up, restraint, control, or even destruction!*  
  
The all mean different things!  
  
The context I allude to and from where I have drawn out this word is the often quoted expression about Yoga:  

## योग: चित्त वृत्ति निरोध \| Yoga: Chitta Vritti Nirodh

I have included him in the CC.

Thanks and regards,

Amba Kulkarni
