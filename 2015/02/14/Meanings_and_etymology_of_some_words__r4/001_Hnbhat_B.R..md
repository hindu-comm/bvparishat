Etymology and the meanings in which the word used need not always  
related in any way. Etymology is any word can be related to any root  
confirming in form as the etymology as Nirukta, is explained as  
derived from the roots, in five operations. Note that it is not only  
the meaning of the verb, but the extentions or restictions of meaning,  
by usage, both for the verb and the noun derived (other than  
adjectives, participles). अर्थातिशयेन योगः  
  
वर्णागमो वर्णविपर्ययश्च द्वौ चापरौ वर्णविकारनाशौ।  
धातोस्तदर्थातिशयेन योगस्तदुच्यते पञ्चविधं निरुक्तम्  
  
Historical etymology could be got with the meanings in different  
languages derived, by borrowing words could also be got from different  
etymological dictionaries, like Monier Wiliams, who many times remarks  
of unknown origin.  
  
Here is a sample search in Vacaspatya:

There are several dictionaries in this link which could be referred to
