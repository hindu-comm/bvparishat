Respected Scholars,  
  
First, I searched a book "kaivalyanavaneetam" on digital library of India website (<http://www.new1.dli.ernet.in>) and it shows the result like- -- [KAIVALYA NAVANEETHAM](http://www.dli.ernet.in/cgi-bin/metainfo.cgi?&title1=KAIVALYA%20NAVANEETHAM&author1=THANDAVAR&subject1=KAIVALYA%20NAVANEETHAM&year=1933&language1=tamil&pages=84&barcode=1990050050639&identifier1=CMU&publisher1=SARADHA%20VILASA%20%20PRINTING%20PRESS&contributor1=SARADHA%20VILASA%20%20PRINTING%20PRESS&vendor1=NONE&scanningcentre1=akce,%20universal%20digital%20library&slocation1=NONE&sourcelib1=CMU&digitalrepublisher1=AKCE%20UNIVERSAL%20DIGITAL%20LIBRARY&digitalpublicationdate1=2018-02-04&rights1=OUT_OF_COPYRIGHT&copyrightowner1=SARADHA%20VILASA%20%20PRINTING%20PRESS&format1=TAGGED%20IMAGE&url=/data/upload/0050/644%20target=). 1990050050639. 1990050050639. THANDAVAR. 1933. tamil. KAIVALYA NAVANEETHAM. 84 pgs  
I downloaded this book. but this is partly scanned book. This book is in Tamil, with regret I don't know Tamil Script. So I am attaching first page of that book, If any, who know Tamil, translate its name, author, published, description etc. can help me.  
  
Second, This book is not fully scanned and uploaded on DLI website. How can I get this whole book in any media? If any book is not properly scanned and uploaded, where we can inform about it? Experts are requested to give suggestions.  
  
with regards  
  
Janakisharan
