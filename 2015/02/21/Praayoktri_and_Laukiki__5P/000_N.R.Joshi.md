Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



I have three unrelated questions



(1) PrAyoktrI Vivaks'A and LaukikI Vivaks'A was explained previouesly in Sanskrit by Prof Korada on BVP list. Is it possible to explain it in English so I can understand better?



(2) Sanskrit is also called GIrvANa bhAs'A. What is the meaning and etymology of the word GIrvANa? Where did it appear first? Who used it first?



\(3\) Svam rūpam śabdasyāśabda Saṁjñā



Out of 4 words, I could not figure out the third word? Is there sandhi or else? Ihave vague idea thatit has to do with word and its meaning.



Thanks. Eager to learn from great scholars of BVP.NRJoshi.
