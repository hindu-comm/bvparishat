Very simple explanation. It is the simple concept as applied to grammar in certain cases.

  

In English, it can be simply explained as the usage, "weave the cloth with these threads". Here it if it to be woven, it cannot be a cloth, only after weaving it becomes cloth. If it is cloth, it is already woven and need not be woven. Hence the justification of the usage, even before the cloth is prepared, taking into consideration, the name it is given after the weaving. Hence it is really need to be called the would be "cloth", in the future after the weaving it is called cloth. Hence the usage relied upon the would be name "cloth" though there is no cloth at present, but only they are threads. This is called भाविनीं संज्ञामाश्रित्य व्यवहारः. Prof. Korada would explain this as applied in शास्त्र functions also.

  

The same with ओदनं पच the ओदन is cooked rice and the rice before cooking is called only तण्डुल. तण्डुलानोदनं पच would be a perfect usage.

  

It may not be so simple with the usage of it in शास्त्र function. Anyhow the भाविनी संज्ञा will not be so simple as this Laukika vyavahara.\\

  

  

Probably, NR Joshi mistook भाविनी for *भाविनि* which is सप्तमी, whereas it is only nominative. as भाविनी संज्ञा. Please read the examples where this concept is used in Mahabhashya or other texts, to understand its application in the शास्त्र functions, as suggested by Prof.Deshpande.
