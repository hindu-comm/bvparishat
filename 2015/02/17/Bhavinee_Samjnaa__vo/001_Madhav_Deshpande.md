Dear Dr. Joshi,

  

  Bhāvinī saṃjñā is a technical conception in Patañjali's Mahābhāṣya (see on P.1.1.45, etc). Under normal circumstances, a saṃjñā or a technical designation applies to a linguistic item depending upon its features at that point in derivation. For example, the term vṛddha applies to an item whose first vowel is a vṛddhi (ā, ai, au). However, in some cases, a term is applied to an item taking into account its future form in the derivation (bhāvin = future), rather than its current form. In such cases, Patañjali calls it a bhāvinī saṃjñā. For more technical understanding, you need to consult the Mahābhāṣya where this term is used. With best wishes,

  

Madhav Deshpande
