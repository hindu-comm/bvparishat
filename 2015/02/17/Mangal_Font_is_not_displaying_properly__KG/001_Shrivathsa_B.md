To solve all typing problems, you may use the Bhashaime tool. More than anything else, the developer shrii Venkatesh is greatly helpful. If you are constrained to use baraha (I don't see why) you may solve your problems this way.  
1. For this problem, you can paste unicode text from some other file / Internet and try typing inside the pasted text.  
2. Why use baraha pad when you have Bhashaime?

svasti,  
 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,
