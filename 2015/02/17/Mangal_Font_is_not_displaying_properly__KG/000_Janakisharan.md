Respected Scholars,  
Namaste  
  
I want technical guidance from scholars on two points-  
(1) I installed Baraha 8.0 in Windows 7, by pressing F11 I can write Devanagari in Baraha Pad, but at the same time Ms-Word 2007 is not displaying Mangal font. it show something like this- eÁ£ÀQÃ±ÀgÀt GvÀÛªÀiï  
Means Mangal font is not working in MS-Word. I have selected Hindi language from Control Panel.  

\(2\) In Baraha Pad also Mangal font is not displayed as per the Indian standard Devanagari script i.e. the Conjuncts are displayed separately. like "द्य" , ब्राह्मणम्, विद्युत्. I am using Windows 7 (32 bit). Earlier I had Windows XP SP2, where is was working properly.

Experts are requested to give some link or guidance for this. If earlier it had discussed, give me thread-link.

thank you

Janakisharan
