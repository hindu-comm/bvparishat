Note-

While selecting key board- please select "Devanagari Inscript" instead of what is shown in the picture.

And this keyboard can be used in browsers, MS Office anywhere.

  

Request to the group members-

Please let me know- if there is an option for Phonetic keyboard (Indian language according to English spelling) through this process- because when I tried "US" it did not work. My friends need it.
