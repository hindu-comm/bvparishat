Another option-

1\. You can activate/install the Unicode fonts directly in your system (Windows) in Regional Language options. If Win7, the process is here-

<http://www.lipikaar.com/unicode-and-language-settings-in-windows#vista-info>  

I do not know if Phonetic keyboard option is available- I work with Inscript keyboard.

  

2\. If you want a beautiful "Indian looking" Devanagari font, you can use Sanskrit 2003 font. (Attached). Issues like"द्य" ,will be solved.

  

All the best
