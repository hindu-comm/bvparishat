Don't know if a soft copy exists but you may refer the fourth volume (*Strī Pratyaya*) of the *Vyākaraṇa Candrodaya* byPaṇḍitaCārudeva Śāstrī. The fourth volume was first published in 1972 by MLBD, New Delhi.

  

In addition, the sixth volume titled*Strīpratyayaprakaraṇam*of the*Bhaimī*commentary on the *Laghusiddhāntakaumudī*by Paṇḍita Bhīmasena Śāstrī may be helpful. WhileBhīmasena ŚāstrīJī's work is structured on the lines of the*Laghusiddhāntakaumudī*, his in-depth treatment of the topics and citations from many other works apart from the*Kaumudī*make the work a must-have resource on feminine affixes. Latest edition (third) published in 2009 by Bhaimi Prakshan, New Delhi.The volume is also available on [archive.org](http://archive.org) under<https://archive.org/stream/Vyakarana/Laghu-Siddhanta-Kaumudi-Bhaimi-Vyakhya-Stri-Pratyaya-Prakarana-Part-6>
