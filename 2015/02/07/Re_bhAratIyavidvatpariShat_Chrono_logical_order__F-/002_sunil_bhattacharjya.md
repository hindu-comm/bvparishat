Dear Dr. Joshi,  
  

Your conservative estimate fits in well with the timeline for the Sutra period, as suggested by Max Muller, as the outcome of his Aryan invasion theory (AIT). You may also consider the other options such as the ancient historical timelines according to Puranas, Rajatarngini etc, which suggest that King Kanishka lived in the 13 th century BCE, Lord Buddha lived about five centuries earlier and the Mahabharata period was much before that. May be you will also like to see Dr. Narahari Achar's astronomical dating of Kanishka, which incidentally uses epigraphic information also.  
  

Regards,
