Dear Dr. Joshi,



The most probable scenario is Jaimini and Badarayana were contemporaries, while Badari, Asmarathya and Atreya should have lived prior to their time. As a piece of unsolicited advice, I would urge you to think more in terms of relative chronologies of various ancient Acharyas, allowing for overlap in timelines for probable contemporaries, rather than attempting to fix absolute dates in BC and AD terms. Another complication to keep in mind is two or more authors with the same name, either really or in terms of attribution of texts/views by later writers.



Best regards,

Vidyasankar
