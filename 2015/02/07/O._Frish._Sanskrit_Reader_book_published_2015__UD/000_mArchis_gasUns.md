Namaste,

  

 The book on which I've been working as an editor has been published.

 Books outside India are expensive. And even more expensive it is to send them to India. As of January to send less than 1 kg of books to India costs 800 roubles, that's almost same amount in rupees.

 2nd and 3rd book (a Sanskrit reader with a dictionary in Russian, Czech and English) in my Sanskrit series in Moscow is out <http://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/6748038/> and can be ordered.

 ISBN 978-5-906564-02-3 and ISBN 978-5-906564-06-1, together 182+355 pages. It's a reprint of a book printed 60 years ago in Praha with my preface and biography and status update on Sanskrit lexicography.

Full index of texts included at <http://samskrtam.ru/ofrish-sanskritskaya-xrestomatiya/> I've received 100 copies and about 20 are left. If postage is paid, I can send the two volumes worth 1000 roubles for free.

Let me know if additional info needed.



 Marcis, Krasnodar
