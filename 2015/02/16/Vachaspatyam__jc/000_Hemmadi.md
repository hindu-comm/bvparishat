Namaste to all learned members of this forum,  
  
It's a privilege to be a member of this group.  
  
I am a student of Sanskrit. I am sure I will learn a lot from your posts & will be able to understand & love this beautiful language more.  
  
currently I am referring to "vachaspatyam"... for the first time sanskrit dictionary. Till now i had referred to dictoinaries where meaning were given in English etc.  
  
As I am referring it, it gives text/examples along with the abbreviation of the reference-Granth. But I have not been able to get the full form of these abbreviations i.e. full name of the reference Granth. I am sure it is mentioned but I havent been able to locate that info.  
  
Can someone Please guide me?  
  
with regards
