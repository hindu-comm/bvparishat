Respected m'am,  
  
Thanks for the guidance. But since I couldn't locate them,  
  
(1) can you please guide me as to under what heading ? & if possible, how to read it.. eg. in the entry of "Arundhati" , I found reference
text with reference names "vru. san.(anuswar)", "gobhi"... But I am unable to find the full name of these reference granthas.  
  
(2) also pl help me to find...  
(a) why the the words like "ardha" are written as "ar***d***dha"..  
(b) words like "surya" is with single "y" but "dharma" is written as "dhar***m***ma".. why is so?  
  
is it any rule of sanskrit grammer?  
  
M'am, pardon my ignorance in this forum of scholars as I take my babysteps in Vaachaspatyam & sanskrit.  
  
with sincere regards
