Literature on swarayoga has healing aspects placed alongside many other aspects such as supernatural manipulations, fortune-telling etc. You may have to sort out the stuff and pick what you are looking for.



The prANAyAma related exercises picked up and used for healing purposes by organizations such as Patanjali yogpeeth of Ramdev Baba may suit your enquiry.



nADI is used for diagnosis. If you are interested in that aspect there are BVP threads on that in which remarkable digging up of literature was achieved through collective efforts.
