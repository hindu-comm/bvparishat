Dear Sirs,  
  

While acknowledging Dr. Michel Danino and Prof. Saroja Bhate, pointed out, I wish to say that the editorial of Prof. Roddham is an eye opener to both the sections which are heaped in rightist and leftist biases. Let us all keep this healthy and truth-living view with regards to any thing that is connected with Indic learning and enlighten the world while our selves getting enlightened.  
  

regards  
  

ganesh
