This editorial in Current Science by Prof. Roddam Narasimha is a brilliant  
analysis of the current scene in India as far as history of science is  
concerned. The media (and, I am sorry to say, many of our scientists)  
usually go for the easy target, i.e. those who make fantastic claims,  
ignoring the other “camp”, that is, those who profess scepticism but without  
taking pains to study the genuine scholarship in the field. It is to this  
other camp that Prof. Narasimha’s core message is addressed. I hope his  
message will be heard.

GUEST EDITORIAL  
The ‘historic’ storm at the Mumbai Science Congress  
  
The 102nd Indian Science Congress, meeting at Mumbai  
during 3–7 January 2015, was dominated by loud national  
debate about the history of science in India, a subject that  
does not normally figure on the Congress programme.  
The dust raised by the storm has just begun to settle  
down; so it is time to look back on it and attempt to analyse  
the roots of the debate.  
  
The centre of the controversy was a symposium on  
‘Ancient science through Sanskrit’, organized for the  
Congress essentially by a group of Sanskrit scholars and  
academics. Surely it is appropriate for the Congress to  
debate the subject, especially as there are such polarized  
views on it. To over-simplify matters somewhat, the  
opinions that are commonly heard in public discourse  
come from two distinct camps. One claims that our  
ancients knew all about many branches of modern science  
and technology, ranging from relativity and quantum  
mechanics to stem cell biology and aerospace technology.  
The other camp sarcastically dismisses any claim about  
past achievements as dubious, if not absurd. These debates  
are often tied to a related philosophical issue as well: do  
Indians have (or have they ever had) what Jawaharlal  
Nehru liked to call a scientific temper? I believe both  
camps have gone too far. This is surprising because there  
has recently been an increasing number of more authentic  
accounts of classical Indic science published in India and  
abroad.  
  
Now the debates surrounding the Congress generated  
three specific controversies. The first concerned ancient  
Indian aviation technology. A presentation made on the  
subject, based on Bruhat Vimana Sastra attributed to  
Maharshi Bharadwaj and Vaimanika Sastra (VS) by  
G. R. Josyer, described four types of ‘vimanas’ from these  
‘ancient’ books. One of these vimanas was supposed to  
fly at around Mach 10, another had a base exceeding  
300 m in diameter; but curiously there is not a word on  
the crucial question of weights. These designs have been  
shown to be scientifically unsound in a critical analysis of  
VS (Scientific Opinion, 1974) by a group of reputed scientists  
in the Departments of Aerospace and Mechanical  
Engineering at the Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru  
(H. S. Mukunda, S. M. Deshpande, A. Prabhu, H. Nagendra  
and S. P. Govindaraju, all of them by the way genuine  
lovers of Sanskrit). For example, the designs violated  
Newton’s laws, and even got the sign wrong for the thrust  
of their engines. The work seems traceable to an original  
dictated by a self-taught, impoverished but serious  
Sanskrit scholar in Karnataka sometime during 1900–  
1922, and could not have been Vedic by any criterion.  
This effort at creating a false history of Indic science is a  
spectacularly bad example of the absurd lengths to which  
attempts at glorification of our past can go.  
  
But the other two controversies were of the opposite  
kind. One concerned the ‘theorem of Pythagoras’ (5th  
century BCE), although there is no record of even a statement  
of the theorem by Pythagoras. The Egyptians and  
the Babylonians used several ‘Pythagorean’ integer triplets  
as early as the 2nd millennium BCE, but they stated  
no general proposition. An explicit statement of the theorem  
does however appear in Baudhayana’s Sulva Sutra (a  
manual of the ritual geometry needed in the construction  
of Vedic fire altars), asserting the equivalent theorem that  
the square of the diagonal of a rectangle is equal to the  
sum of the squares of the two sides. The date of the work  
lies roughly between the 5th and 8th century BCE. Thus  
Baudhayana’s assertion of one of the hoary results in  
geometry is the earliest available record in the world, and  
predates Pythagoras.  
  
The third controversy concerns plastic surgery, which  
seems to have been driven in several parts of the world  
by the need to repair broken noses (apparently an ancient  
and common punishment worldwide), cleft lips, etc. The  
first records go back to Egypt in 3000–2500 BCE. In the  
6th century BCE, Suśruta consolidated Indic ayurvedic  
knowledge in an encyclopaedic and foundational text  
called the Suśruta Samhita. This included the practice of  
plastic surgery, in which India clearly remained well  
ahead of the rest of the world. Thus the first major rhinoplasty  
in modern West was performed as late as 1815 by  
a British surgeon who had served in India for 20 years,  
and was triggered by British press reports about how  
Maratha soldiers who had lost their noses in the Anglo-  
Mysore wars were surgically set right in Pune. There was  
no European competition to so-called ‘Indian Nose’, so  
Indic claims on plastic surgery seem to be on solid  
ground.  
  
Regarding the scientific temper issue, even a cursory  
examination of classical Indic philosophy and scientific  
thinking shows that a strong rationalistic streak has been  
present, side by side with mythology of some kind, for  
almost as many millennia as our civilization has flourished.  
A striking example here is the ancient Samkhya  
school of philosophy, mentioned already in the Upanishads  
and boasting a distinguished 20th century admirer  
in J. B. S. Haldane. The Nirisvara (non-theist) branch of  
this school went so far as to say that there was no evidence  
(no pramana) for the concept of Isvara or god.  
Samkhyas believed in conservation of matter, saying  
‘nothing material can be realized from the non-material’,  
na-avastuna vastu-siddhih; and so would have summarily  
dismissed any claims to produce matter out of nothing.  
According to Samkhya, nature experiences evolution due  
solely to its own internal dynamics; so there was no room  
for creationism. Inanimate nature could nevertheless be  
beneficial to human-kind – as with rain for example; so  
they attributed the apparent design that often characterizes  
nature to pure accident. These views have survived  
for thousands of years in India, despite the scathing criticism  
of great acharyas like Samkara. Is it not astonishing  
that the rationalist movement in India never takes the  
Samkhya views of the world as starting points?  
Samkhya philosophy has had a strong influence on  
classical Indic scientific thinking. Charaka (\~1st century  
CE?) describes how Agnivesa, the founding father of  
Ayurveda, engages in a discussion ‘surrounded by  
Samkhya philosophers’. Bhaskara (12th century) begins  
his famous treatise on algebra, the Bija-ganita, with an  
invocation that is a clever punning stanza that can be  
interpreted as praising either number or the Samkhyas.  
In public Sanskritic discourse science and mythology –  
siddhanta and purana in Sanskrit – are often mixed even  
today, but the debate between them has a long history in  
India. In such debates the arguments have varied from the  
rather sensible view that the puranas are for salvation and  
the siddhantas are for worldly affairs (vyavahara), so  
their domains were different, to the pauranic criticism  
that siddhantic calculations cannot be accepted as proofs  
of reality. An interesting case of famous adversaries  
involves Āryabhata (5th century CE) for whom eclipses  
were a matter of shadows, but Brahmagupta (7th century  
CE), brilliant mathematician as he was, upheld the pauranic  
Rahu–Ketu story even as he predicted eclipses by  
the shadow theory. Nilakantha, a versatile Kerala astronomer–  
mathematician–philosopher (1444–1545), said that  
his work was rooted in yukti (skill, reasoning), not in the  
sacred scriptures. Contrast this with how Francis Bacon  
(1561–1626), just a little later, invoked God and Bible  
quite often, and another century later Newton secretly  
wrote much more about theology than he did about  
science. So we cannot accuse Indic classical science of  
being unduly irrational.  
  
Finally, a few words about Indic mathematics, which I  
consider has not yet gained the global or domestic recognition  
it deserves. Apart from the well-known numeral  
system, and the algorithmic/computational revolution  
it sparked, the number of advances made in India long  
before they were (re-)discovered in Europe keeps increasing  
as we learn more of our own history. Look at these  
examples: a large part of algebra, first solutions to linear  
and quadratic indeterminate equations (Aryabhata, Brahmagupta);  
the binomial theorem, the combinatorial formula  
and Pascal’s triangle (Pingala 3rd century); second-order  
interpolation formulas and the Newton–Raphson  
method (Brahmagupta), the Fibonacci numbers (Virahanka  
700 CE, Hemachandra \~1150 CE); the basics of  
differentials, maxima of functions, mean value theorem,  
etc. (Bhaskara \~12th century, Munjala \~ 800 CE); infinite  
series, and a precursor of what later came to be known as  
calculus and analysis (Madhava 14th century): so the list  
goes on. These contributions are not just ‘little’ mathematics,  
and the ‘big picture’ of their collective influence  
on the world was succinctly and accurately summarized  
by Hermann Weyl when he wrote (Preface to The Theory  
of Groups and Quantum Mechanics, 1928):  
  
‘Occidental mathematics has in past centuries broken  
away from the Greek view and followed a course  
which seems to have originated in India and which  
has been transmitted, with additions, to us by the  
Arabs; in it the concept of number appears as logically  
prior to the concepts of geometry.’  
  
This extraordinary tribute is a striking recognition of the  
slow, silent but inexorable diffusion of Indic mathematical  
ideas to Europe through creative Islamic volunteers,  
culminating four centuries ago in a redefinition of what  
mathematics was, and the profound revolution that we  
call modern science. With a legacy like this we do not  
need to invent unlikely stories about the past; we just  
need to work hard in the present.  
  
It is high time we learnt once again to distinguish science  
from mythology (either can be fun, but they are best  
when not mixed), evidence-based reasoning from unthinking  
acceptance of authority or speculation, and the  
rational from the superstitious (realizing that a full life  
may not be purely rational: consider Ramanujan, for  
example). To make that happen is a responsibility that  
scientists here must accept, working in close collaboration  
with friendly outsiders. Our youth are hungry for a  
sensible knowledge of our past, but are denied an opportunity  
to acquire it by a marvellous educational system  
that shuns history in science curricula, and by the paucity  
of attractive but reliable accounts of the fascinating history  
of Indic ideas. Our academies, universities, museums  
and other institutions need to make such a project a  
national mission. Anything less would be irrational blindness  
to a unique legacy.
