Respected All,  
  

Namaste.  
  

I read this editorial a couple of days back. I just thought to share my following comments that I had with Prof. K. Ramasubramanian:  
  
- Prof. Narasimha's article is a straightforward reply to all those who does all that propaganda about Indian science.  
- The references that he quoted about Pythagorean theorem and Plastic surgery are really potential for further arguments. - Pointing to Samkhya philosophy as the primitive source of 'science' in the world, with explanation, motivates the discussion further.  
- I believe, Hermann Weyl's acknowledgement of occidental Indian mathematics is inspiring to all the scholars working in this field.  
- Prof. Narasimha's correlation of east with the west in context of science and mythology is superb.  
  

Thanks to Prof. Michel, for posting this informative piece in BVP.  
  

With regards,  

Prasad
