Sir,  
  

The above situation has been in existence for several centuries. In the Jivanmukti viveka of Swami Vidyaranya we find, in the वासनाक्षयप्रकरणम् -  
  

तथा हि देशविशेषेण परस्परं निन्दाबाहुल्यमुपलभ्यब्ब् ते । दाक्षिणात्यैर्विप्रैरौत्तरा वेदविदो विप्रा मांसभक्षिणो निन्द्यन्ते ।
औत्तराहैश्च *मातुलसुतोद्वाहिनो* यात्रासु मृद्भाण्डवाहिनो दाक्षिणात्या निन्द्यन्ते । ....एवं स्वस्वकुलगोत्रबन्धुवर्गेष्टदेवतादिप्रशंसा परकीयनिन्दा च आविद्वदङ्गनागोपालं सर्वत्र प्रसिद्धा ।  
  

For the question you have raised, would it be proper to point out the marriage of Arjuna with Subhadra?  
  

I think when we recognize that it is 'शिष्टाचारः’ with respect to these practices, and if those who argue appreciate this, there will be an end to such censures and counter-censures.  
  

warm regards
