Respected Scholars,

  

While on the subject of Gotra and Sapinda I wish our learned scholars to this topic:  

  

This is an issue which always goes undefended morally and scientifically. This topic invariably shows the traditions of south Indians (Brahmins as well as non-Brahmins) in a morally depraved situation in the company of North Indian Hindus. Where is the sanction for such marriages? My friends go to the extent of terming this practice as an incestuous tradition.

  

Please let us start a discussion on this issue from all possible angles, such as morality, religiosity and science.

  

Please excuse me for using some unpleasant terms.   

  

Regards,

  

Ramchander Deekonda
