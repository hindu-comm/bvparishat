I am glad that a conference to reconsider the teaching of languages in India is being held. But why should the invitation to a conference of such as importance —

and a national one at that — be sent only 3-4 days before the conference is scheduled to begin and why should the invitation leave out the academically most important part, namely the list of research papers to be presented and the names of their presenters?

  

Over the years I have frequently noticed on the Indian forums such as the BVP that announcements of conferences appear so close to the conference dates that it must be impossible for non-locals to attend them and it must be only a few locals who can attend them. On similar forums in other countries this rarely happens. I would request my colleagues in India to reconsider this situation seriously and reverse the ratio of conferences announced sufficiently in advance and the conferences announced, in effect, only to get the satisfaction of making an announcement. (Just to avoid two possible misunderstandings: I have attended some excellently planned conferences in India. The intention behind this writing is not to single out the organizers of “Rethinking Language Teaching in India”.)

  

There is a national crisis of language teaching in India. Sanskritists in particular still, largely, seem to be under the impressions that the society will continue to support them and what they cherish and that they do not have to make the persons in their field aware of the social change taking place all around and to equip the Sanskrit teachers and students to think creatively and resourcefully. I hope the organizers of RLTI will give a comprehensive summary on this forum of the observations made in the conference and the solutions proposed and get a forthright dialogue going.
