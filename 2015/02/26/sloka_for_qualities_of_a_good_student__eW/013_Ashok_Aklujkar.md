Dear Professor Paturi,

  

Your methodology was impeccable.

  

If the four clues you had been given are all found \*in the same sequence\* in the list you discovered on the Internet (except for inconsequential difference like namrataa for namra), the probability has to be in favour of constructing the verse form essentially the way you have. 

  

Of the three verse form variations you have presented, the one withनम्रोत्साही चजिज्ञासुर् must be set aside because it cobbles namra.h and utsaahii through an objectionable sandhi (namra.h u should not go beyond namra u) and because ca comes in a wrong place (not after jij;naasu˙ as it should).

  

The one withनम्रश्चोत्साही जिज्ञासूdoes not sound metrically correct (hii should be hi), has ca at a wrong place and requires the taking of jij;naasuu incongruently as a dual.

  

The one with नम्रउत्साही also falters metrically (hii should be hi).

  

Therefore, if what is essentially correct is to be further improved and the reconstructed verse is to be made acceptable, something like the emendation inउत्साहिजिज्ञासू, a minimal emendation, may be the only way out. (Prof. Hegde'sजिज्ञासुर्नम्र उत्साही, although metrically flawless, reverses the sequence of namra and jij;naasu).

  

You write; \>as long as the actualoriginal verse is notfound in its original source,the best that we could do is what we are currently doing.\<

  

I agree.

  

a.a.
