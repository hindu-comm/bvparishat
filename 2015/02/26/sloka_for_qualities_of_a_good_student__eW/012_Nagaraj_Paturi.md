how exactly the recovered version was put together :



Step1: One of my acquaintances asked me to help him get the full text of the verse 'on the qualities of a good student'beginning with शुचिर्वचस्वी .He said therewere words such as namrata jijnaasoo etc. in the verse he heard in a pravachan. 



Step 2: While I was searching on the internet, I found the link



<http://lakshmi-myautographsweet-memories.blogspot.in/>2009/10/eduction.html

Where it waswritten:



So these characteristics of teacher were quoted in ancient Hindu Vedas as—"Desiko navalakshna" which means "teacher needs nine characteristics to teach" they are:  

1. Suchir—external and internal cleanliness  
2. Vachasvi—articulation or effective expression   
3. Varchaswi—bright and charming personality  
4. Dhritiman—courage, physical and moral  
5. Smrutimaan—good memory  
6. Kriti—ability to write well  
7. Namratah—humility & politeness  
8. Utsahi—enthusiasm or high motivation  
9. Jijnasu—a sprit of research or desire to learn more and more  
  
Doesn't this checklist tally with the modern prescription?



I found this matching with my friend's clues.



Step 3 : I found the words after somecorrectionsfittinginto an anushthup verse, in the order in which they were listed there. Iput the देशिको नवलक्षणः part into the fourth quarter of the verse as that is the formula of such verses. I then created



शुचिर्वचस्वी वर्चस्वी धृतिमान् स्मृतिमान् कृतिः 

नम्रश्चोत्साही जिज्ञासू देशिको नवलक्षणः



Step 4 : 1. Dr. HN Bhat corrected जिज्ञासू toजिज्ञासुः



 2. Prof. Aklujkar corrected कृतिः to कृती



3. Prof. Aklujkar suggested a dvandva उत्साहिजिज्ञासू



4. I wrote :How will be

 शुचिर्वचस्वी वर्चस्वी धृतिमान् स्मृतिमान् कृती

 नम्रोत्साही चजिज्ञासुर्देशिकोनवलक्षणः

 or else,



 शुचिर्वचस्वी वर्चस्वी धृतिमान् स्मृतिमान् कृती

 नम्र उत्साहीजिज्ञासुर्देशिकोनवलक्षणः

 5. Prof. Janardana Hegde suggested



 शुचिर्वचस्वी वर्चस्वी धृतिमान् स्मृतिमान् कृती।

जिज्ञासुर्नम्र उत्साही देशिकोनवलक्षणः ॥’ इति पाठः युक्ततरः स्यात् ।



I think as long as the actualoriginal verse is notfound in its original source,the best that we could do is what we are currently doing.



Thanks and warm regards,

Nagaraj
