'Jijnaasurnamra utsaahi' is the best suitable reading in my opinion. Such types of verses are called 'Subhaashitas' that are mostly found in the various anthologised works. The compilers or scribes are not so serious about the correct readings. Other matters---order or sequence are not considered in making any verse for maintaining its metrical correctness. A humble submission with regards,
