शुचिर्वचस्वी वर्चस्वी धृतिमान् स्मृतिमान् कृतिः

नम्रश्चोत्साहीजिज्ञासू देशिकोनवलक्षणः

  

k.rti.h should be k.rtii (masc. nom. singular of k.rtin ‘one who has done his work, accomplished’).

  

If utsaahii jij;naasuu is changed into a dvandva as utsaahi-jij;naasuu, the metrical problem will be removed. (The n of utsaahin will be deleted in compounding as it is in countless other compounds with a n-ending stem as the first member.) The compound will naturally be in the dual number and the long uu at the end will be in order.

  

Because all other adjectival words of the verse are in the singular, an adjective in the dual will be odd, but, in a verse that is obviously meant to give a list to facilitate memorization (i.e., which is not meant to be a kaavya), this will not be a serious blemish.  

  

An oddity may be felt also in accepting a dvandva of adjectives, but it should be noted that, for the Pa.niniiyas (as against W.D. Whitney, p. 485) this could be akarmadhaaraya like ;[sukla-k.r.s.na](http://sukla-k.r.s.na) ‘(something that is both) white and black’, to be treated the same way as suptotthita ‘(first) slept and (then) awakened/arisen’, and virala-virala ‘(something) virala which has become even more virala, very/extremely sparse’. The dissolution then will be utsaahii ca jij;naasu.h ca ‘energetic/enthusiastic and curious’.

  

If one insists on viewing it as a dvandva because of the dual number, the compound could be like ;[sukla-k.r.s.na](http://sukla-k.r.s.na) in ;[sukla-k.r.s.ne](http://sukla-k.r.s.ne) gati hy ete jagata.h ;saa;svate mate (Giitaa 8.26) or adharottara-vyakti’ (Malavikagnimitra act 1) in which the adjectives function essentially as nominals. The surface dissolution will be the same as above, but the meaning of utsaahin will be close to ‘one who has energy/enthusiasm’ and of jij;naasu to ‘one who has curiosity’.

  

In either understanding we have a problem. With the first, an adjective with a dual number must apply to one and the same person, namely the de;sika. In the second, we have to explain an ordinary possessive derivative and an ordinary desiderative derivative as if they were bahu-vriihi compounds.

  

The foregoing should be viewed as an explanation of the oddity — of why we hesitate to compound utsahin with jij;naasu and why a reading like utsaahii (a separate nominative singular word) comes into being.
