Respected scholars,

I have been silently following this thread which was begun to get a sloka about the qualities required for a student. But the sloka that has been quoted is enlisting the qualities of a Desika or a noble teacher. It is really an excellent sloka enumerating the virtues of a Teacher.
But from the day first of this chain I have been trying to recollect the sloka (About the expectations from students) which I taught to Intermediate II year students of AP in the year 1996 from the lesson SUBHASHITANI of their the then text book. At last after a great struggle I could bring out of my memory. This is the following sloka:

  

आलस्यं मदमॊहौ च चापलं गोष्ठिरेव च।

स्तब्धता चाभिमानित्वं तथाऽत्यगित्वमेव च॥

एते वै सप्त दोषा: स्यु: सदा विद्यार्थिनां मता:॥

  

Of course in this sloka the seven blemishes of students which are to be avoided are mentioned. So the absence of these seven blemishes can be the seven virtues of the students. With a hope this sloka may be useful to the member who began this chain I present it here.

  

With warm regards,   

**Dr. Rani Sadasiva Murty**
