With the help of internet search I could gather words of this verse and tried to reconstruct the verse. It seems to have gaNabhanga at places. I request the list members help me reach the correct version with these clues:



शुचिर्वचस्वी वर्चस्वी धृतिमान् स्मृतिमान् कृतिः 

नम्रश्चोत्साही जिज्ञासू देशिको नवलक्षणः
