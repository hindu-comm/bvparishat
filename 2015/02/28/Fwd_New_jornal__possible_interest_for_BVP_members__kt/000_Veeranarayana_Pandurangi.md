Dear Dr. Veeranarayana N K Pandurangi,

  

I'm not an Indian scholar and therefore I know that I am not eligible to participate in the Bharatiya Vidvat Parishad (BVP) group. However, I suppose that some of the members of BVP might be interested in this information about a new journal published in Brazil:

  

“Cultura Oriental” publishes articles resulting from original research relating to various cultural aspects of Asian Far East (especially India, China, Japan and Tibet), including language, religion, literature, philosophy, arts and other subjects, covering both the current culture and its historical aspects. Its scope does not include, however, subjects such as economy, trade and politics of the contemporary period.

  

“Cultura Oriental” is published by the Graduate Program in Religion Sciences of Federal University of Paraíba (UFPB). The editors of “Cultura Oriental” are Fabricio Possebon (UFPB) and Roberto de Andrade Martins (USP, UFSCar). This jornal is published in two versions: electronic (ISSN 2358-5021) and printed (ISSN 2358-503X):

Thank you very much.

  

Yours sincerely,

  

Prof. Roberto de Andrade Martins

Universidade de São Paulo (USP) at São Carlos, Brazil
