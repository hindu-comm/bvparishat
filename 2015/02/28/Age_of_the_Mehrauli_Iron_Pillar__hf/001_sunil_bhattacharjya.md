Dear friends,  
  

I apologize for an inadvertent slip in one sentence in the previous mail. The corrected sentence is as follows :  
  
Further it is known that the name of **Sri Harsha's father** was Chandra and the name Chandra has been inscribed in the In Iron Pillar.  
  

Regards,  

Sunil KB
