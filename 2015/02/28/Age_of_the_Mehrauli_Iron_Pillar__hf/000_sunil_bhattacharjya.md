Dear friends,  
  

I understand that there were some discussions in the BVP on the Iron pillar about 5 years ago, but to my knowledge, there was no discussion on the date of the Iron pillar.  
  
While it is generally agreed that the Iron Pillar was shifted from Udayagiri to Delhi by Anangapal Tomar, the date of the making of the Irom pillar can be traced to Sri Harsha Vikramaditya. Alberuni tells us that Sri Harsha Vikramaditya Era started from 457 BCE, whereas the
Vikramaditya Era started from 57 BCE. This means that Sri Harsha Vikramaditya lived four centuries before Vikramaditya. Further it is known that the name of Sri Harsha was Chandra and the name Chandra has been inscribed in the In Iron Pillar.This shows that the date of the Iron Pillar can be traced to the 5th century BCE.
