Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



While reading a Marathi book by a respectful author from Maharashtra I came across this information---“ Sanskrit language before the time of Panini has accepted certain words from Austric and Dravidian languages of India in the fold of Sanskrit. This has been discussed with open mind by Jaimini in the Arya-Mleccha Adhikarana of his Purvamimamsa. While explaining this Adhikarana Kumaril Bhatta has acknowledged the debt of contribution of other languages to Sanskrit and suggested that foreign words need not be derived using rules of Sanskrit grammar. They can be used as they are even in Dharmika vidhi.

My question –To me this is new information. Dear scholars could you please comment on this and enlighten us on this subject. Thanks. N.R.joshi
