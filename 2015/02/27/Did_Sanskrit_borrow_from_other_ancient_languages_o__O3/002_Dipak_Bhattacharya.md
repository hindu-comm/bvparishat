Prof. Deshpande's book is well-known, but the following is not  
Non-Aryan linguistic elements in the Atharvaveda (a study of some words of Austric origin) Sanskrit Book Depot Calcutta 2000 by late Dr. Abhijit Ghosh.  

Also see Kuiper: Aryans in the Rigveda.  

Prior to these Przyluski and P.C.Bagchi did some work mainly dealing with Classical sanskrit.  

Burrow's contribution too is not negligible. Professor Deshpande has new views too.
