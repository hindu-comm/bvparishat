Dear Usha Sanka,



It is nice of you to post this verse on Dhaatu.



May I take this opportunity to request BVP scholars to tell us the exactmeanings of Dhaatu(root), Aakhyaatam and Kriyaapada(verb). How are they different from each other? Please offer examples.Thanks.NRJOSHI

Namaste

धातुर्ब्रह्मैव सम्प्रोक्तो जीव आख्यातमुच्यते ।

प्रकृतिः कृत्सुबन्तादिः धातुर्ब्रह्मात्मने नमः ॥

This is a verse on dhAtu, with good meaning- whose primary source is unknown to me.

Unfortunately, I have forgottensecondary sourceas well, from which I had taken this initially.

Please provide the source.

Thankyou in advance.
