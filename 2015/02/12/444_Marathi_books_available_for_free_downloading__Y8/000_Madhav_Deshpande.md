The Maharashtra Rajya Sahitya & Samskriti Mandal has now made 444 of its Marathi book publications available for free download:

For those who read Marathi, this is a treasure of rare and out-of-print books. In the past, I had to struggle to find many of these books in bookstores in Pune. Now they are a click away. Hope you find something of value in this collection.
