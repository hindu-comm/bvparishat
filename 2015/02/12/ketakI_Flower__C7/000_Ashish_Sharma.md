Dear Learned Scholars and Guruvars

Pranaam

  

I am looking for a reason that why Ketki Flower is banned for Shiva worship.

Anyone can explain apart from Puraanik story?

Is their any philosophical or scientific logic behind Ketki flower to be banned?

  

Waiting for reply

  

regards

  

Ashish Sharma
