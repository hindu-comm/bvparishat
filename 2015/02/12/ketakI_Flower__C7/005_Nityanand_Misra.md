In the *Devī Bhāgavata*, the account occurs in the thirty-third *Adhyāya* of the fifth *Skandha*. The curse ofŚiva is described in the verses (DB 5.33.44-47)  
  
तदाकर्ण्य हरेर्वाक्यं महादेवः सनातनः॥ कुपितः केतकीं प्राह मिथ्यावादिनि मा वद। गच्छतो मध्यतः प्राप्ता पतिता मस्तकान्मम॥ मिथ्याभिभाषिणी त्यक्ता मया त्वं सर्वदैव हि। ब्रह्मा लज्जापरो भूत्वा ननाम मधुसूदनम्॥ शिवेन केतकी त्यक्ता तद्दिनात्कुसुमेषु वै।  
  
Translation by *Svāmī Vijñānānanda* under <http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/db/bk05ch33.htm>  
  
*The eternal Mahâ Deva, hearing the words of Vi*sn*u, spoke thus to Ketakî with great anger, “O Liar! Do not utter such false words; You dropped down from My head and Brahmâ while ascending up, picked you up on the way. Now as you have told a lie, I will never take you; you are henceforth forsaken by Me.” Brahmâ was then very much put to shame; he bowed down to Vi*sn*u; Mahâ Deva, forsook the Ketakî flower from that date.*
