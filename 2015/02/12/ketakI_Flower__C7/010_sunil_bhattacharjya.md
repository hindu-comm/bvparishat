There could be some other reasons too but that would not certainly contest the pauranic story. The austere Lord Shiva may not be fond of the highly fragrant Ketaki. Moreover this highly fragrant flower may attract insects, which in turn may attract snakes and one had to be extra careful while picking the Ketaki flower, particularly in the ancient times, when the anti-venom injections were not available. In spite of the anti-venom shots being available there are many snake-bite-deaths still occurring in India.
