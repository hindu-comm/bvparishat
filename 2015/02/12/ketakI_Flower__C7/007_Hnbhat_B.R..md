Exactly, no reply so far explained apart from the Puraanik story.

  

I think he expects any Botanical Feature or property that make it unfirt for worship of ***Shiva***or any other Scientific reason for banning it by Shiva(?). apart from the reasons quoted in the Purana-s. And some reason put forward by Venkat Sriram, does not make it unfit for worship of Shiva, but in general for any worship.

  

I think (but do not have any Puranic source) that it is banned on otherdays for the worship of Shiva (and not for the worship of any
other gods and it is used in genral) but it is used especially on Shivaratri day only, the ban is lifted. Any source for this belief or practice?
