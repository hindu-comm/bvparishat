As per the sixth chapter titled *Liṅgapratiṣṭhāvarṇanam* of the *Kedārakhaṇḍa* within the *Māheśvarakhaṇḍa* of *Skandapurāṇa*, the Ketakī flower gave a false testimony that Brahmā had seen the top of the cosmic and ever-expanding Liṅga. As a result Śiva cursed the flower that it will never be used in the worship of Śiva.  
  
The verse describing the curse is (Sk.Pu. 1.1.6.63)  
  
सुगन्धकेतकी चापि अयोग्या त्वं शिवार्चने।  
भविष्यसि न सन्देहो अनृता चैव भामिनी॥  
  
The chapter is attached with this email.  
  
There are accounts in the *Devī Bhāgavata* and the *Śiva Purāṇa* also.
