Further to the trailing mail, our pujya acharya told me that if one observes this flower, the flower has a tendency of moving back & forth (a sort of whirling and shaky attribute) while falling down on the ground from the tree. This sort of whirling & shaky tendency while falling down resembles the "dilemma whether to speak truth or not" among the humans. 

  

To verify this, one needs to closely observe the falling of that flower which was duly verified by our acharya.
