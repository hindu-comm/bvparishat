I am thankful to Nagaraj Pauri Ji and Guruvar HnBhat Ji who have understood my query but still no one else had answered.

  

Please give me reply beyond the Puraanik story.

Hn Bhat Ji had told that its not banned on Shivratri but is it true or not that i dont know. Please some one explain why it is being banned for Shiv Puja etc. No repetition of Puraanic Reference.

Regards

  

Ashish Sharma
