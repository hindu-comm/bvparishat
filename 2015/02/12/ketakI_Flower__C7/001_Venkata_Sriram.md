Namaste,

  

Once I asked this question to our pujya acharya. He said that this incident conveys that hypocrisy, double-standards in the form of "a-satyaM" has no place before God. 

  

He further explained to us the 5 popular stories from "satya-narayana vratam" where the devotees promise a vow but fail to act. The tri-karaNa shuddhi is most important and all the three ie., manas, vAk, kAya should be tuned towards one objective. The sankalpa made through mind should reflect in words; and the words should be converted to action. The discrepancy leads to "a-satya" which is a violation of cosmic law and is dOsha for which one is liable for disciplinary action.


  

regs,

sriram
