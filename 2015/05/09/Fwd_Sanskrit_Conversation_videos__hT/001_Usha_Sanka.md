Namaste

This is a very good effort. The topics are interesting too. Thanks to the makers of these videos. I saw first two videos and sixth one.

Topics in them are- Aam Admi Party, rAja-paramparA kind of thing in Congress, Nepal earth quake. They are good discussions. For learners who want to develop "Listening" skill, these will help.  
One suggestion- Please add a tag-line in youtube Title itself. "Discussions in Samskrt about Current affairs". Just "Chanakya uvaca" might not lead searchers to these videos.

Thanks again.
