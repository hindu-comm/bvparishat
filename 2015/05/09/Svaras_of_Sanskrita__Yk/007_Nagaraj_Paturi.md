I had an offline discussions with one of my friends who is an expert in computational music and is currently engaged in the shruti aspect of his project.



He replied as follows:



Dear Prof. Nagaraj,

  

Although I am not an authority on these matters, I feel vowels, accents and tonalities are different types of the same vocal phenomenon. Swaras are defined as

  

स्वयं राजन्ते इति स्वराः\|

  

in linguistics as well as in music. Swaras do not require support of other Varnas for pronunciation while Vyanjanas require support of swaras for pronunciation. In this sense swaras are not dependent on any other pronunciations. Also they dictate and rule the pronunciation and linguistic behavior of other Varnas in terms of pronunciation and meaning. Meaning of words is largely dictated by vowels, accents and tonalities. In this sense swaras literallydictate meanings of words.

  

Secondly from linguistic point of view all are thevarieties of swaras such as all types of vowels- अ, इ, उ and their short and long forms as well as diphthongs such as ए, ऐ, ओ, औ and their varieties are originated from the samepronunciation \`अ' . Same is the case with musical tonalities since they are also rendered in the form of vowels and not Vyanjanas. Vedic accents are also rendered in the form of vowels and not asVyanjanas. लघु, गुरू, उदात्त, अनुदात्त, स्वरित, अनुनासिक, सप्तस्वर,all are variations of अ through vocal processes. So essentially all are swaras. 

  

It will be an interesting research to apply panini's swaradhikara sutras to accents and tonalities. My immediate hunch is that it is possible to do so.Because सन्धि of Vedic accents is already in practice. We need to explore similar process for musical swaras.

  

Any way it very interesting topic.

  

With Warm Regards
