Please see my footnote in the attached page which covers the definitions given in Mahābhāṣya, Saṅgītaratnākara and Saṅgītasudhākara (commentary on Saṅgītaratnākara), along with the derivation of the word Svara as per grammar. The page is from the upcoming second edition of Adhyātmarāmāyaṇe'pāṇinīyaprayogāṇāṃ Vimarśaḥ.
