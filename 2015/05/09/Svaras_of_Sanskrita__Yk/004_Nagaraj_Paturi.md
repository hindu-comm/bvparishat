For svara as a vowel, praaNa is a synonym , whereas for svara as 'accent' in vedic recitation and svara as a musical note in Indian classical music, this is not a synonym.

  

Though 'svara' is the popular way of naming the 'accent' in Vedic recitation and 'note' in Indian classical music , Prof. Murthy clarified that 'svaradharma' is a more precise usage in this context.

  

Researchers in Indian classical music often attempted to diachronically connect the svara as accent in vedic recitation and svara as a note in Indian classical music(saying that music svaras originated from the vedic svaras).

  

Apart from this, while considering etymologies of svarah, the following points are to be kept in mind:1. the basic meaning of svara seems to be sound and voice. The other meanings could be extended from this meaning. 2. Etymology of the word 'svarita' should also to be brought into the fold of this discussion. Is there verb root connection in this word or not is to be settled. If there is one, then the question arises: whether the word svara under discussion is connected to the same root or not.
