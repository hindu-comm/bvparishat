The focus of this question is twofold. 1. The real meaning of the word स्वर as it is interpreted as applicable to the three concepts on English. 2. Is it possible to use three distinct words to note these three categories?

Sri Nithyananda and Prof. Murthy have tried their best to describe different uses of the term and Murthy has tried to make distinctive usages and the difference between the English concepts.

Now the 2nd question remains. For the accents and the musical notes, are there any distinct words for each covering the two categories other than "svara". For the first is called स्वरधर्म-s and the second remains. From the detailed descriptions offered by Murthy, it appears the seven musical notes are also Svaradharma-s.

Any other cover these two categories?
