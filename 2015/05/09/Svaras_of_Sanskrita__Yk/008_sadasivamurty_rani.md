This is in continuation to my previous attempt to say something about SVARAS.

It needs a little more analysis here in this present context. Let us have a step wise view of the aspects.

1\. Two types of sounds in the Nature

Sounds are two types :i. Articulate Sounds ii. Inarticulate Sounds

All Speech Sounds are Articulate Sounds and all other natural or artificial sounds in our surroundings like the sounds of birds, animals other things are Inarticulate Sounds.

2. The Speech sounds are again of two types in all human civilized languages with a clear system of grammar as : VOWELS and CONSONANTS which or otherwise called SVARAS and VYANJANAs in Sanskrit right from the Pratisakhya Age.

3\. At this juncture we often listen to the two words ;1. **Aksharam** 2. **Varna**

Generally AKSHARAM is used to refer to any of the speech sounds. But basically it refers to VOWELS only. Hence it is in Rk Pratisakhya defined as: **savyanjanah saanusvaarah suddho vaa svaraha aksharam.** - which means: "a vowel pure by itself or in association with a consonant or anusvara is **aksharam**. According to this definition an **aksharam** can be taken as **a single expressible independent speech sound unit** and in other words can be called a "**syllable**".

Some observations to be noted here are:

i\. From the definition of AKSHARAM in Rk Pratisakhyam it can be observed that Vowels (SVARAS) and VYANJANAS (Consonants) are the two distinct classes of speech sounds in language.

ii\. A SVARA even independently called AKSHARAM while a VYANJANA or ANUSVARA assume AKSHARATVA only in association with any SVARA not independently.

iii\. So as observed by all other scholars in this thread of discussion SVARAS are independent in being uttered.

**4. ACCENT or SVARA DHARMAS:**

Each of the SVARAS have two basic characteristics as far as their **quantity** and **quality** is concerned.

***The Quantitative Characteristic of Vowels have three variations as:*** ***Hrasva, Dirgha and Pluta**.*This Quantitative Characteristic of Vowels gifted the mankind the three classes of vowels: a) Short Vowels or Pure Vowels i.e. a, i, u and r b) Long Vowels (Dirgha and Pluta forms of Vowels) and Dipthongs from various combinations of these two classes of vowels WHICH ARE THE RESULTANTS OF THE NATURAL SANDHI SYSTEM OF VOWELS.

**Thus a Vowel quantitatively conditioned is called SYLLABIC INSTANT. (MATRAA MITA).**

***The Qualitative Characteristic of Vowels have three variations as: Udaatta, Anudatta and Svarita,*** which are the resultants of the pitch variation in uttering the VOWELS.

*All these six : **Hrasva, Dirgha Pluta, Udatta, Anudatta and Svarita** have no independent existence in the absence of any VOWELs (Svaras) and hence are called **SVARA DHARMAS** in PRATISAKHYAS.*

  

**5.The names of 3 ACCENTs and 3 types of LENGTH of the VOWELS are Adjectival by nature**: hence we have expressions like:

i\. Hrasvah svarah, Diirghah Svarah, Plutah Svarah, Hrasvah Akaarah, Diirghah Akaarah, Plutah Akaarah, (

ii\. Udaatthah Svarah, Anudattah Svarah, Svaritah Svarah. Udaattah Akaarah, Anudaattah Akaarah, Svaritah Svarah.

These six words are SVARA QUALIFIERS. Hence any such SVARA which is qualified by these characteristics is called "

  

**6. VYANJANA DHARMAS:**

Each Vyanjana has two characteristics: 1. As per its length being Arthamatra (having a length of half mora) and 2. Svaraasrayatva. (Being a dependent of a Vowel for its convenient pronunciation in the normal speech).

  

I shall take another occasion to explain the Svaras in Music about which I had an occasion to make an in depth study.

Pranams to all.
