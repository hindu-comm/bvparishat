Dear Dr. Nityananda Mishra,

  

  Due to the diversity of Prakrits and Apabhraṃśa languages, it is difficult to find a uniform rule in a grammar book. However, Woolner, in his Introduction to Prakrit, p. 12, notes:

“Note.—In place of the omitted consonant was pronounced a weakly articulated ya (laghu-prayatnatara-ya-kara). This was weaker than the y of Sanskrit or Magadhi, and was not expressed in writing, except in MSS. written by the Jains.”

I have attached a page from G.V. Tagare's Historical Grammar of Apabhraṃśa that discusses what happens when intervocalic consonants get lost and two vowels come next to each other in Prakrits, and especially in Apabhraṃśa languages.

With the weakening of the final "a", pāy(a) and pāv(a) result from Skt. pāda, and pāy and pāv (with weak or laghuprayatnatara y and v as noted by Woolner) are phonetically indistinct from pāi and pāu. When it comes to final "u" of Prakrit/Apabhraṃśa words, another process is at work, namely the change of the nominative ending -aḥ to o/u uniformly, irrespective of sandhi.
