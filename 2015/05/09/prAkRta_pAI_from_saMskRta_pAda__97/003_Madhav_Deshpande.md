When the intervocalic voiced consonants of Sanskrit are lost in Prakrit, there are normally three alternative developments:

  

a\) pāda \> pāa

  

The other two alternative regional developments happen when the hiatus in forms like "pāa" is filled dialectally by either y or v, giving us:

  

b\) pāa \> pāya

  

or

  

c\) pāa \> pāva

  

Further erosion of the final "a" produces forms like pāy/pāi, pāv/pāu in Apabhraṃśa versions, which are the sources of modern Indo-Aryan languages like Hindi and Marathi.
