Namaste  
  
The word **pāī** in Prakrit and modern Indian languages means one-fourth. In all probability, it is derived from Saṃskṛta **pāda**.  
  

The elision of **d** is by the Sūtra  
  
कगचजतदपयवां प्रायो लोपः (प्राकृतप्रकाशः २-२)  
kagacajatadapayavāṃ prāyo lopaḥ (Prākṛtaprakāśaḥ 2-2)  

  

What Sūtra causes terminal **a** to change into **ī**?**  
**

  

Thanks, Nityanand
