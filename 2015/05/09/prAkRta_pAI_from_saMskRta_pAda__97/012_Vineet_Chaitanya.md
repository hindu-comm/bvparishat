Namaskaara.  
  

 *pāī (পাই ) - one-fourth of an ana (আনা).  
   
*

** I have seen पाई, it was one twelfth of an आना. One आना was equivalent of four पैसा, and one पैसा was equivalent to three पाई. पाई was not in circulation in my childhood but पैसा was. However, in arithmetic we used to calculate amount of money in terms of रुपया, आना, पाई.*
