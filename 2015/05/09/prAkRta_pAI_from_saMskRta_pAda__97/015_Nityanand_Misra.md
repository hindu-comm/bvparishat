Going through the Prākṛtaprakāśaḥ again, I noted oneSūtra which can account for this

  

**sandhāvacāmajlopaviśeṣā bahulam (PP 4-1)**  

**सन्धावचामज्लोपविशेषा बहुलम् (प्रा.प्र. ४.१)**

In Sandhi (sandhau), specific vowels (ajviśeṣāḥ) and specific elisions (lopaviśeṣāḥ) optionally (bahulam) \[occur in place\] of vowels (acām). \[Translation mine\]

  

On this,Bhāmaha’s commentary reads:  

क्वचिन्नित्यं क्वचिदन्यदेव।तेनान्यदपि लाक्षणिककार्यं भवति।

  

This is quite like the interpretation of bahulam in Pāṇinīya tradition.  

  

With this, the word can be derived as

  

pāda -> kagacajatadapayavāṃ prāyo lopaḥ (PP 2-2) -> pā’a -> sandhāvacāmajlopaviśeṣā bahulam (PP 4-1) -> pā’ī

  

The Sūtra and the commentary by Bhāmaha can be seen here: <https://archive.org/stream/prkritapraka00varauoft#page/n65/mode/1up>

  

On page 816 of volume V of the Abhidhānrajendraḥ (is this the Vācaspatyam of Prakrit?), pā’ī is listed as derived from pātrī: <https://archive.org/stream/abhidhnarjendrak05vijauoft#page/816/mode/1up>
