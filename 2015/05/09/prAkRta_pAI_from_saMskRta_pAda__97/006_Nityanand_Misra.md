Thanks Prof. Aklujkar Ji. While Sanskrit catuṣpadī (which is called caupāī in Prakrit) has ī at the end, the stand-alone **pāī** also means one-fourth in Prakrit and Hindi. What I had in mind was the unit of currency pāī (written in English as pie) which was one-fourth of an Anna. The East India Company minted one pie coins in 1830s on which एक पाई was inscribed in Hindi, Urdu, Persian abd Bengali. Some examples can be seen [here](http://www.chiefacoins.com/Database/Countries/East_India_Company.htm) and [here](http://static-numista.com/catalogue/photos/inde_britannique/g861.jpg). The Hindi phrase पाई-पाई चुका देना also refers to this (or maybe an older) unit of currency.  
  
Here is one published source which attributes पाई to पाद. On page 310 of the book Truths of language, or Comparative philology of the Sanskrit, Bengali and incidentally other Prakrits: Parts I & II (1928), Srinath Sen writes:  
*pāī (পাই ) - one-fourth of an ana (আনা). ... S. ‘pāda’ (পাদ) - one-fourth. By dropping ‘d’ it becomes ‘pāa’ (পাঅ) or ‘pāī’ (পাই).  
*  
I could derive pāa (पाअ) using कगचजतदपयवां प्रायो लोपः (प्राकृतप्रकाशः २-२), but the second word I could not.  
  
The usage of पाई in the sense of foot is attested to in Braja since at least 15th century, as Sūradāsa’s famous composition चरन कमल बन्दौं हरि राई ends with बार बार बन्दौं तेहि पाई (I bow to His feet again and again).
