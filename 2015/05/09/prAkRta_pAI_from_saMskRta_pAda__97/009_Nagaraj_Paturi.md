Intersting.



pāda> pāa> pāya> pāy \> pāī



in stead of



pāda> pād>pāy>pāī



Do pāa and pāya have usages (lakṣyas)or they come for theoretical purposes only? I can not claim to have seen all the lakṣyas. Nor is it wrong to have some forms just for theoretical purposes as intermediaries during derivation.



pād has usage (lakṣya).



pāda> pāa> pāya> pāy \> pāī does not account for this lakṣya. Probably there is a separate lakṣaṇathat accounts for this lakhya.



Iam able tolearn from the learned discussion.
