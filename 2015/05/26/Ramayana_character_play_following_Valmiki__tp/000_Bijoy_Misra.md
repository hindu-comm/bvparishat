Dear friends,  
  

Good morning.  

I am sharing below the links to the video from the Valmiki character play  

that we attempted in Boston two weeks ago. The actors are students in a class  

I teach at the local Sai Temple. We spent three evening sessions in working  

through the script. Each character had ten stanzas to memorize and act out.  

The material for the characters are extracted from the book and the selections  

are mine. The goal was to examine the characterization of each personality  

as portrayed by the poet. Our reading program would complete in 2019.
We  

hope to improve on our presentation as we get more familiar. I am giving  

the links for your review and possible blessings to the students for their  

efforts. The links are in four parts including an introduction by me.
