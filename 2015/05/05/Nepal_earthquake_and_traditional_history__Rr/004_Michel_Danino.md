Dear Narayana,  

  

Thanks indeed to and Shri Ajit Gargeswari for this fabulous resource. So 1255 fits well with Campbell's account.

  

Certainly, the study of natural disasters (which is technically part of environmental history as much of history of science) is very much neglected in India. I will mention it to Dr Nanditha Krishna, who at ICHR recently suggested thatenvironmental history requires attention. Will try to follow up on this.

  

Regards,

  

Michel
