Dear Michel,

When I worked on history of earthquakes, I could not locate the sources for Nepal. Later I got a book from a Nepalese gentleman about "natural calamities in Nepal" I will try to scan the book one of these days. Meanwhile, grateful thanks to Ajit Gargeswari for the fantastic link to online books! This is indeed a treasure trove of history.

In the book 

MEDIAEVAL HISTORY OF NEPAL

the original sources of history are traced to the Vams'avalis (Genealogy). The above book lists several of these:

V1, V2, V3 (as a whole VBd) = The three parts of the Gopdla-vams'avali, in National

Archives, 1.1583.7, discovered by C. Bendall.

VD = Vams'aavali in possession of Dh. Bajracharya, published in CNS, 511 (1977), 116-122.

VK = Vams'aavaliin the Kaisher Library.

VL =Vams'aavalisummarized by S. Uvi, Le Ne'pal, 11.

VT =Vams'aavaliin Sanskrit verse, photographs in possession of Professor G. Tucci.

VW =Vams'aavalitranslated in D. Wright, History of Nepal, Cambridge 1877.

  

On p.88 of the above book we read:

  
The chronicles register also serious earthquakes, a kind of disaster  
to which Nepal is often exposed. The worst tremor happened  
at the end of Abhayamalla's rule, on **Monday, June 7th, 1255**. One  
third of the population perished; the king himself was fatally injured  
and died six days later, ending thus a long but not happy reign.  
  

History of anomalous natural events (divya, antariksha, bhauma utpaata) is an important aspect of cultural history that is neglected in India. I hope ICHR under its new push about "History of Science" would take up this subject seriously.

  

Best..

Narayana
