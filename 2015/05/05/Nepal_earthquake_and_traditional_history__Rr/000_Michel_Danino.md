Respected scholars,



A few days after the Nepal earthquake I chanced on the attached account by A. Campbell of an 1833 earthquake in Kathmandu. Interestingly, it refers (in the last sentence) to a powerful earthquake recorded by Brahmins “in their histories” and dating back 600 years earlier, i.e. around 1233. An article in *Science* (also attached) on the recent quake refers to one in 1344 “preceded by one farther to the east, in 1255 C.E.” The latter date is very close to the one suggested by Campbell’s “account”.



For Indian earthquakes, Prof. R.N. Iyengar authored in 1999 a comprehensive “Earthquake history of India in medieval times” (*IJHS*, 34(3), 181–237) but I am not aware of any similar attempt in Nepal. I would be grateful for references, if any, also whether any traditional history of Nepal (comparable to Kashmir’s *Rajatarangiri*) exists.



Regards,



Michel Danino
