Dear Sanskrit friends,  
  

We had our debut of exploring Valmiki's characters through text and drama  

last Saturday. I had a five-person cast: Lakshmana, Kaushalya, Dasaratha,  

Bharata and Rama (i order of appearance). My logic was to present the  

characters as Valmiki might have conceived. So, I selected longer statements  

which can be used as monologues. The expectation was that through the  

proper dramatic rendering, the character would present itself to the audience.  
  

Lakshmana had the segment where he is upset that Rama is being exiled.  

He suggests Rama to join him and occupy the throne through a fight.
Lakshmana  

appears to have a short temper and a bravado. Ayodhya XX in Gitapress edition.  
  

Kaushalya had the segment where she is resigned to Rama's exile. She loves  

Rama very much but knows that Rama would not yield. She praises him and  

requests if she would be allowed to follow him like a cow following a calf. Ayodhya XXIV  
  

Dasaratha had the segment where he recants his life before his death the following  

day. Dasaratha assumes his errors in life and blames himself for all the mistakes.  

He tells these in front of Kaushalya, but Kaushalya hardly cares.
Ayodhya LXIII  
  

Bharata had the segment of a dream he had about his father. He tells his friends  

about the ferocity of the dream. He sees his father being beaten up in the  

most awkward manner in a deadly night. He thinks the father is dead.
Ayodhya LXIX  
  

Rama had the segment where he pacifies Lakshmana in order to proceed towards  

the hermitage of Agastya in the south. It is in the eleventh year of their exile and  

Lakshmana is tired. Rama explains why Agastya must be met. Aranya XI  
  

I am attaching a picture of the characters. It was held in the local Sai Temple.  

about a hundred persons attended. I will give a link to the video when it is uploaded.  
  

We will continue with Aranya XXII Sunday. Another performance next year.  
  

Thank you.
