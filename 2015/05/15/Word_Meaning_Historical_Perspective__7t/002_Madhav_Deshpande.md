Dear Dr. R. N. Iyengar,

  

  Please find attached here a recent article of mine that comprehensively treats the expression *devānām priyaḥ* in Ashokan inscriptions and its interpretation in relation to Vedic usage, Grammatical tradition, and Buddhist literature. May be of interest to some on this list. Best,

  

Madhav Deshpande
