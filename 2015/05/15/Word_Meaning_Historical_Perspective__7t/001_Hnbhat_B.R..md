"देवानांप्रियः" इति मूर्खेl

देवानामिति। वार्तिकमिदम्।मूर्खः-अज्ञः। "दिवु क्रीडायाम्"। देवाः-क्रीडासक्ता मूर्खाः, तेषां प्रियोपि मूर्ख एव, मूर्खप्रियस्यावश्यं मूर्खत्वादिति "अजेर्वी"त्यत्र कैयटः।

Literally it could mean छाग= goat,as it it is offered to propitiate the देव_s, gods.

And in addition, the word देव could be derived from the verb which has 25 meanings and the phrase can simply the dear one to deva-s and Katyayana notes it as a compound without loosing the case endings of the compounded words.

Similar case is पश्यतोहरः = a thief grammatically.

The history of the meaning depends on the first usage and the first usage in the meaning in the context is based on the date fixed for the text.

Polysemy is another problem as given in the lexicons based on the usages, but without giving the source chronological development and hence not useful in deciding the given text for which no date has been fixed as usual in many works and authors.
