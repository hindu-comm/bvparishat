I'm a student interested in Linguistics and Indian Palaeography.

I know several Indian scripts(15+) and can identify almost all scripts of South Asia.

I found some unusual andnot yet deciphered two scripts.

It was found in between the Kannada manuscript Basavapurana.

So they belong to Karnataka.

The first one has characteristic headline.

But does not show anyresemblancewith NorthIndianscript such asDevanagari.

The second script has slanting lines like Nastaleeq ,But do not show any similarity with other script.

The direction of script is also not known.

It is not known whether they are variants or independentscripts.

But they appear to be of Brahmic origin.

They have signs similar to visarga and Anusvara.

The language may be Sanskrit or Kannada.

Looking at script of Kannada used in the manuscript may be 200-250 years old.

Kannada are used in margins for marking page no.

This is a paper manuscript and not apalm leaf.

If any one Know about and the users of these two scripts.

**Please share and respond.
