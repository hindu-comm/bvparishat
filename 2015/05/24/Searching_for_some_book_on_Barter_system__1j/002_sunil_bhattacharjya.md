Namaste friends,  
  
In the same context may I have a query too. That is, when did the "dhenu-mulya" and "kawri(kawdi)-mulya" come into vogue and how long did that system survive. Lord Balarama donated thousands of cows during his pilgrimage and that could have been in terms of dhenumulya and not necessarily as donation of live-cows.  
  

Regards,
