A fewcautions to be takenwhile pursuing this topic:



1\. Barter was not the only non-money system, particularly in India. Therewere non-money non-bartereconomic systems such as 'jajmani system' too.



2\. These systems including the money based systemneed not be viewed as various stages of development of economy as is being usually done. There are evidences to believe that they ran simultaneously parallel to each other in the same location (say, kingdom).



Books on ancient IndianArithmetic, Kavyas where barter transactions are described as part of narration, kaifiats etc. are thesources to look for to find documentations andreflections of bartertransactions.



Telugu poetic works that I know to have reflected barter transactions are from recent history (17th century onwards)
