In 1982, we a team of NSS Volunteers camped for 15 daysin a village in the southern part of Andhra Pradesh in which majority of the economic transactions were through barter only. We found the villagers knowing the existence of coins and currency notes. Very few of them could identify the value of each of the denominations. They were gullible when they participated in transactions through money.



Fieldwork in such places which continue even today the barter system might help in understanding the material on this from literary or other sources.
