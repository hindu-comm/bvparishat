Hare Krishna.  
Dear Vidvaj-janas,  
  
I am looking for some book on detailed information on barter system  
that was current in ancient India. If someone has researched on this  
topic and has written a book or articles or paper it will be very  
helpful for me.  
  
My expectations from the book/paper - details of guiding principles  
used to set relative exchange amounts of different commodities (say  
how much rice to be given for 1Kg Tuver dal, or how much of rice to be  
given for one hour of labour service, etc). Along with this if details  
of the relative amounts at different locations is available it will be  
great.  
  
I have written this email just so as to reach a broader research  
circle and do understand that such things may not be easily  
explorable. Just in case someone knows it, it will be very helpful and  
timesaving for my research.  
  
Thankyou,  
damodara das
