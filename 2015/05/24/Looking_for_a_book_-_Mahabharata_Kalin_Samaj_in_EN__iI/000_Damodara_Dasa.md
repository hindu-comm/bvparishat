Hare Krishna.  
  
Dear Vidvaj-janas,  
Recently I read a book in Hindi "Mahabharat Kalin Samaj." This book is  
originally composed by Sukhamaya Bhattacarya, probably in Bengali.  
Pushpa Jain translated it into Hindi. Is there any english translation  
also? I am in need of English one. I liked to book.  
  
Thankyou,  
damodara das
