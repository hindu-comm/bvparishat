Hare Krishna.  
  
Respected Vidvaj-janas,  
  
I am looking for a book by Gajapati Rudradeva, Sarasvati Vilasa. I do  
have its Vyavahara-kanda published by Rastriya Sanskrta Vidyapeetha,  
Tirupati. But I want to get all the chapters of this grantha. In my  
knowledge this is done from mysore. But I am unable to get its  
information. If anyone can help me locate either e-copy (scanned) or  
hard book for purchase, it will be very helpful. Also any translations  
of this work (if exists) will be very helpful.  
  
Thankyou,  
damodara das
