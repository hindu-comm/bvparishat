\>\>Their argument would be -even a novelist could give realistic details of the places covered in his book; that does not make the story created by him for the novel real.  
  

Actually this is not a very sound argument. This takes it for granted  
that unless every chance for these literatures to be a novel or myth  
are not disproved we cannot accept it to be true. Nothing can be  
completely proved by this process. If you apply this to modern science  
then almost everyhting will be considered myth as in every fields  
there are more than one explanations. The neutral view should be to  
see towards which conclusion does the evidence lead more. Then there  
are more grounds to accept that Ramayana is not a myth but historical  
fact.  
\[by myth here I mean the normal definition of the word in the dictionary\]  
  
Thankyou,
