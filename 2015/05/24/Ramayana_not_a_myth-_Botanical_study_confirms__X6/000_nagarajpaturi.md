One of my students shared this link with me:

Those who consider the book not to be history do not get convinced with this information.Their argument would be -even a novelist could give realistic details of the places covered in his book; that does not make the story created by him for the novel real.



But the fact remains that the author has such a great command over the details of the places covered in his book.
