Namaskaara Nagraj Paturiji.  
  

 My assertion follows from the general convention of Devanagari script. In this script one indicates the order of consonants by top to down and left to right convention. here are some examples:  
  

Top to down: द्ध, र्प, प्र ,त्र, क्त, द्य  

Left to right: क्य, प्ल, च्छ, म्ल  
  

One writes ब्राह्मण as ब्राम्हण when one wants to make it clear that ह follows म् as it done by Marathi speakers.
