Dear Prof. Deshpande,



To make my focus in this thread more clear, let me frame my questions as below:



What is your pronunciation of these words?



How do you ask your students to pronounce these words?



If you yourself follow the metathesis version and ask your students to follow the same, how do you explain the discrepancy between the roman/phonetic transliteration and the instructed pronunciation?



If your own pronunciation and the pronunciation you instruct to your students is not different from the roman form, there is no requirement of an explanation for any discrepancy, as there is none in that case.



Thanks for your understanding.



Nagaraj
