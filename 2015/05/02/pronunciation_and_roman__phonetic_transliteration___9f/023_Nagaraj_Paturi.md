The following is only limited to a part of the theme of the thread, only with regard to ब्रह्मन् and related words:

"बृहत्त्वाद्बृंहणत्वाद्वात्मैव ब्रह्मॆति गीयतॆ /"

----- introductory part of Bhamatee

He banks upon this derivation repeatedly on several occasions inside the book.

I request those interested in the thread not to focus on the advaitic content of the quote (lest the discussion should digress from the theme of the thread) .The focus here is only on the fact that a great scholar such as Vachaspati Mishra derivesब्रह्मन् , at least as one of the options, from बृंह .
