Dear Dr. Paturi,

  

In my article "Linguistic Presuppositions of Pāṇini 8.3.26-27" \[pp. 23-42, in *Proceedings of the International Seminar on Pāṇini* (held in July 1981), ed. by S.D. Joshi and S.D. Laddu, Publications of the Centre of Advanced Study in Sanskrit, Class E, No. 9, University of Poona, Pune, 1983\], I have discussed Pāṇini's treatment of the anusvāra before *hm* and *hn*, and have noted that Kātyāyana extends this pattern to *hy, hv, hl*. I have shown that Pāṇini's treatment restricted to *hm* and *hn*, is due to specific linguistic environment of the northwestern frontier region, while Kātyāyana's extension of the same treatment to *hy, hv, hl*, is most likely due to the Prakritized pronunciation of Sanskrit, where all *h*-initial clusters of Sanskrit undergo metathesis. This metathesis is widely documented in inscriptional and literary Prakrits from Ashokan inscriptions onwards. The fact that both Pāṇini and Kātyāyana formulate their rules (*he mapare maḥ, napare naḥ,* Kātyāyana's Vārttika: *yavalapare yavalā vā*) as option rules probably indicates that the metathecised pronunciation of the *h*-clusters was still not universal, but only optional. I don't have a scan of my article, but it should be available in libraries in India.
