Good and inventory discussion, going around history, linguistics and grammar and the spoken/Vedic pronunciation/regional practice.

The points brought out are the same as in the earlier ones as I had been watching the earlier threads closely and had posted replies in some and now the new participants are very firm in their assertions. Now let me make out the essentials of the problem which I too had asked my paternal uncle why it should be pronounced so differently from what is written unlike ther Sanskrit words? I got only the it is traditionally pronounced so शिष्ट pronunciation as remarked by Prof.N agaraj, the initiator of the question this time and that makes the difference. It is either the pronunciation other than that is शिष्ट-s is incorrect and the orthographic presentaion in roman/Devanagari not representing the pronunciation of the शिष्ट-s is incorrect which seems to be the focus of the arguments of dear professor.

1\. The real nature of the problem lies is the rules of Panini do nothing for the pronunciation of individual letters like h, m, n like others. It is left to the domain of शिक्षा texts and पाणिनीय शिक्षा in these cases of clusters with h and the पञ्चमवर्ण-s make the letter ह् as औरस्य pronounced in the articulatory point उरस् which is not assigned to any other letters a to h in other cases. This makes the pronunciation in these cases rare one for these words. And in addition, unlike other classes like Anunasika, there is not a sign than the popular one ह like अनुनासिक vowels in the regular alphabet list.

So there is no point in asserting that either the pronunciation or the orthographic presentaion should be correct and the other shouldn't be correct. It seems a moderate way as suggested by Mr. Shivanoori to follow the practice without making in the present orthographic presentation making it clear as special case of traditional pronunciation, to avoid confusion to the students. This aurasya ,"h" in these clusters looks like as if they are pronounced mh, nh,Nh as the case be --- ब्रह्म, मध्याह्न and पूर्वाहण the representative words for the aurasya "h" as per the pronunciation guide in the पाणिनीयशिक्षा quoted in earlier discussions and in this also,The clusters not covered are ह् + ञ and ह् + ङ.

It is a point to be noted that पाणिनीयशिक्षा doesn't prescribe any metathesis as in the other cases Panini and Katyayana have noted and Prof.Deshpande has illustrated as the cases of metathesis. This includes the cases discussed undergone in Prakrit words in respect of these words and clusters.  

Now the deviation discussed is the cluster of h+ल as in the cases of कल्हार,बिल्हण etc. I have seen these written pronounced as ह+ल.
