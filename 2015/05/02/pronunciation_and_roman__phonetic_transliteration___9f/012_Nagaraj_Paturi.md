Prof. Deshpande,



You said:



"BUT WHEN I AM CAREFULLY READING OR SPEAKING SANSKRIT, I SAY BRAHMAN, AND NOT BRAMHAN"



Fair enough.



That solves all the problems for you. You are not in requirement of any explanation to your students about the discrepancy between the pronunciation and transliteration.



My students hear 'mh' and 'nh'not only in the pronunciation of tatsama words in Telugu but in the pronunciation of Sanskrit wordsin Sanskrit during Sanskrit speaking and Sanskrit recitation, Vedic recitation etc. I am in need of an explanation to my students.



If both Panini and Katyayana consider 'mh' and 'hm' pronunciations as vibhaashaas to their respective 'mainstream' versions, and if who considers whichas the mainstream version depends on the region from where he comes, I can not say, one of these is wrong.



Your reason for why you choose 'hm' and 'hn' isyour historical understanding that the 'hm', 'hn' versions precede the 'mh' 'nh' versions chronologically. You are basing on the etymologies too in this regard. In fact historical itself seems to be based on etymological.



If I accept that 'hm' 'hn' versions as the 'ideal' ones, I will have to tell my students that what they hear from the s'ishTas is not the'ideal'. If I ask them to go with the s'ishTas, I need to explain why roman transliterations are different from that.



That apart,



Is not ब्रह्मन् related to बृंह? (Nirukta does not derive it from बृंह, of course.)
