Dear BVP Colleagues,

  

  Since several members have requested the article of mine that I referred to in my earlier message, I am attaching a scan of that article \["Deshpande-Linguistic-Presuppositions-of-Panini-8.3.26-27"\]. This was a paper presented at the International Seminar on Panini held in 1981 at Pune University, and the proceedings were published in 1983.
The article is only tangentially related to the current discussion, but may be of interest to some of you.
