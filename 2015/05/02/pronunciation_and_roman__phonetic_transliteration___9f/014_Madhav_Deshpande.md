Dear Dr. Paturi,

  

Just to clarify my observation. You have made the following comment:

  

"If both Panini and Katyayana consider 'mh' and 'hm' pronunciations as vibhaashaas to their respective 'mainstream' versions, and if who considers whichas the mainstream version depends on the region from where he comes, I can not say, one of these is wrong."

  

To be clear, neither Pāṇini nor Kātyāyana have openly declared that there is optional metathesis in the h-initial clusters of Sanskrit.
What I am saying is that when Pāṇini says that kim + hnute can optionally become kinhnute in sandhi, the most likely reason could be optional Prakritized metathecised pronunciation of such clusters. This is not a literal understanding of the words of Pāṇini and Kātyāyana, but a possible conjecture.

  

The Pāṇinīyaśikṣā distinguishes between urasya and kaṇṭhya pronunciations of -h- in different contexts, but does not strictly speak about metathesis of -h- \[हकारं पञ्चमैर्युक्तमन्त:स्थाभिश्च संयुतम् । उरस्यं तं विजानीयात् कण्ठ्यमाहुरसंयुतम् ।।\].

  

The only traditional text that explicitly says that there is a metathesis is the Kauṇḍinyaśikṣā passage pointed out by Professor Shivasenani Nori:

  

कौण्डिन्यशिक्षा is even more explicit -हकारान्नणमा ऊर्ध्वाः पूर्वं तु प्रसरन्ति हात् ।
