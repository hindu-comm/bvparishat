DESHPANDE: WHEN I AM IN MARATHI SPEAKING MODE, I SAY BRAMHAN, RATHER THAN BRAHMAN. BUT WHEN I AM CAREFULLY READING OR SPEAKING SANSKRIT, I SAY BRAHMAN, AND NOT BRAMHAN. I DO THE SAME THING FOR JÑ. IN THE MARATHI MODE, THIS IS PRONOUNCED AS -DNY-, BUT IN MY SANSKRIT CLASS, I INSIST ON -JÑ-. THE REASON IS THAT I KNOW THAT HISTORICALLY THESE CLUSTERS ARE -HM- AND -JÑ-, AND NOT -MH-, -DNY- OR -GY- OR -GN-.

DESHPANDE: I ASK MY STUDENTS IN USA TO PRONOUNCE THESE SOUNDS AS -HM- AND -JÑ-. I WANT THEM TO UNDERSTAND SANSKRIT PRONUNCIATION AS IT IS HISTORICALLY JUSTIFIED, RATHER THAN AS IT VARIES REGIONALLY IN INDIA.

DESHPANDE: THE METATHESIS DOES OCCUR IN MARATHI, WHICH IS MY MOTHER-TONGUE, AND GENERALLY IN THE MARATHI PRONUNCIATION OF SANSKRIT.
HOWEVER, SEVERAL OF MY PROFESSORS (ESPECIALLY PROFESSOR MEHENDALE AND PROFESSOR GHATAGE) IN PUNE WERE CONSCIOUS OF THE HISTORICAL PRONUNCIATION AND EXPLAINED WHY THE HISTORICAL PRONUNCIATION CHANGED DUE TO METATHESIS, DUE TO THE INFLUENCE OF THE MOTHER-TONGUES ON THE PRONUNCIATION OF SANSKRIT IN THE DIFFERENT REGIONS OF INDIA.

DESHPANDE: THERE IS A DISCREPANCY BETWEEN THE TRADITIONAL WRITING OF SANSKRIT AND ITS REGIONAL PRONUNCIATION TODAY. THIS IS NOT LIMITED TO -HM-, -HN- OR -JÑ-, BUT EXTENDS TO THE PRONUNCIATION OF A WHOLE RANGE OF SOUNDS LIKE -Ś-, -Ṣ-, -S- (ALL THREE BEING PRONOUNCED AS -Ś- IN BENGAL, AS -S- IN PARTS OF NORTH-INDIA, AND NO REGION RETAINING A THREE-WAY DISTINCTION IN MODERN PRONUNCIATION), PRONUNCIATION OF -V- AND -B-, BOTH BEING PRONOUNCED AS -B- IN BENGAL. SO WE NEED TO DISTINGUISH THE HISTORICALLY APPROPRIATE WRITING AND PRONUNCIATION OF SANSKRIT FROM ITS REGIONAL VARIATIONS, ALL OF WHICH ARE PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INFLUENCE OF THE MOTHER-TONGUES. IF THE SEQUENCE "TAD + JÑĀNAM" IS REPRESENTED AS "TAD + DNYĀNAM" OR "TAD + GYĀNAM" FOLLOWING THE MODERN MARATHI OR NORTH-INDIAN PRONUNCIATION, WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO EXPLAIN WHY THE SANDHI SHOULD BE "TAJ + DNYĀNAM" OR "TAJ + GYĀNAM." NO LOGICAL LAWS OF PHONETICS WOULD ALLOW SUCH A CHANGE. "D" CHANGES TO "J" BEFORE "J" OF "JÑĀNAM", BUT THERE IS NO LOGIC WHY THIS CHANGE SHOULD OCCUR BEFORE "DNYĀNAM" OR "GYĀNAM".
