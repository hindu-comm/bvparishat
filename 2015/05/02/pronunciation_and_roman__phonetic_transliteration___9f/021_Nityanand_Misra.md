I am not aware if there has been a study on this already, but one can go through Abhinavapāṇini Paṇḍita Rāmaprasāda Tripāṭhī's compilation of 32Śikṣā works - The Śikṣāsaṃgrahaḥ (1989, SSU) - and see how many Śikṣā works have rules which ordain this metathesis. Some of the works included in the book have commentaries.

  

As Prof. Deshpande has pointed out, the Pāṇinīyaśikṣā does not state anything about metathesis, and so to cite it in support of the‘bramha’ pronunciation is not a sound argument.
