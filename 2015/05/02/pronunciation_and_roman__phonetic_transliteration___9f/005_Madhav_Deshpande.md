Dear Dr. Paturi,

  

  If you are not able to find my article in a library accessible to you, I can scan it in the next few days. As best as I know, historically all these clusters are h-initial clusters. The reasons are not hard to see. Just as -jñ- in forms like rājñaḥ is a contraction of -jan- in rājan, similarly -hn- in ahnaḥ is a contraction of -han- in ahan. However, the metathecised pronunciation sets in very early. It is certainly the norm in the Marathi region today, and most likely this is a very old phenomenon. This is also a common error in manuscripts.
