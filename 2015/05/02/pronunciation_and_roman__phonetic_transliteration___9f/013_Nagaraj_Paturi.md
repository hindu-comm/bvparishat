Savinaya namaskaara Vineet Chaitanyaji,



I agree. This is true about Devanagari writing convention. Let us take : र्प, प्र . In र्प the sequence of phonemes is r, p, a whereas in प्र, it is p, r, a .



From a popular/layman'sperspective, consonantimmediately followed by the vowel is considered to be full 'letter' / 'akshar' and the consonant immediately followed by another consonant in such clusters is considered to be half 'letter'/ 'akshar'.Devanagari script-learner sees the principle of 'half scripts' such as the symbol on the top of प being used for half 'letter'/ 'akshar' (consonant immediately followed by another consonant in clusters ) being followed as a rule. For him, प्र
appears to be an exception to this rule, as the slanted line /put in the middle of प is considered to be 'half script' being used for a full 'letter' / 'akshar'.



So, it is not as straight forward as "One writes ब्राह्मण as ब्राम्हण when one wants to make it clear that ह follows म् ".



Hope you understand the point.
