Sir

  

Pranam.

  

I have not yet completed my Ph. D., nor am I in the line of teaching. Kindly refer to me by my name only. The mere fact that kritakrityas like you notice is an honour by itself. Secondly the passage from कौण्डिन्यशिक्षा was first shared on BVP by Brahmasri Vedamurtulu Prof. Korada Subrahmanyam garu, when he first addressed this question, and I thought that this should be stated explicitly.
