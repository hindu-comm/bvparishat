Sir

  

Pranam.

  

What modern linguistics calls as metathesis is strictly accepted in our tradition only in deriving words like सिंहः from हिंस्. In that view, there is no metathesis in the pronunciation of ब्रह्म etc. The ह when conjoined with ण, न and म becomes the aurasya ह, i.e. ह is sort of "nasalized" (for want of a better word, the upamaana pramaaNa is being used) or as if it is transformed to ण्-ह, न्-ह and म्-ह, due to sandhi. The latter ण, न, and म are then not distinctly heard. Since lipi is always only a linga for varnas, which are transmitted orally, and since we do not have a separate varna to represent the aurasya ह, it is written as the kanthya ह - but this fact does not change the spoken sound, nor is a reason to say that metathesis occurs.

  

Since Roman / IAST does not have a glyph for it, we represent the aurasya ha as we do in Devanagari. Now, if we change it to bramha etc., it might give rise to moha in students as to the correct form of the word and is hence avoided. Going by the experience over the last few centuries, if we want to introduce a more accurate phonetic representation of the spoken word, it would be better to introduce a new glyph, and make it similar to "h" to indicate ह् in ह्ण, ह्न and ह्म (there are enough diacritic marks readily available, say the breve, sicilicus and the titlo, to be pressed into service). So, if we were to agree that 1h, 2h, and 3h stand for these, then if we write aparA1hna, va2hni and bra3hma then we will achieve more precision without confusing anybody. Of course, the downside is that everybody would have to then learn this convention.

  

The learning from the last few centuries is this: In representing Vedic sounds we find differences in different recensions to indicate (in Devanagari) the elongated anusvaara and the dvittva of the anusvaara (Taittiriya saakhaa, Maadhyandina samhitaa etc.), svaras (Rigveda, Samaveda etc.) and so on. These are the good practices as they do not create confusion but increase precision of representation of the spoken sounds. The use of bindu to represent ङ, ञ्, ण, न and म is, in my view, an example that we should avoid. Though this practice is widespread in the manuscripts and in early printed versions, students of the present day are quite confused about the correct forms of the words like गङ्गा etc. due to this practice of orthography.

  

Sanskrit today has another problem when it comes to representation in a modified Roman script. There are so many encodings (WX, Harvard-Kyoto, iTrans, Velthuis etc.) in addition to the IAST, that many scholars are put off. For instance, a group of students started a study of the play आगमाडम्बरः of Jayanta Bhatta; though the Clay Sanskrit Library made a version in their own version of IAST available, the person who took the initiative re-typed in Devanagari! This should caution us against too much tinkering.

  

So on balance, my view is that letting things be is the best course of action.

PS: When I referred to tradition in Telangana and AP, I was referring to pronunciation of Sanskrit - not Telugu. Specifically I am referring to GhanapaaThees and Kramaantasvaadhyaayees, and the pronunciation of Veda by others, even if they might not have completed their Vedic education.
