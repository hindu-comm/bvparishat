I have already given the derivation of the word from the same root grammatically as usual or derived which eliminates the न्- म् - ं - element in the root to get the form बृहि - बृन्हि - बृंहि - बृंह् up to ब्रह्मन् while suffixing मनिन् = मन् the न् after the ृ in the root element replaced by अ which makes ब्रह्मन् finally and it is not lost in the formation of बृंह्+अन -- बृंहण in the process of derivation. Vacaspati only emphasizes on the meaning of the verb बृंहण = वृद्धि attached to the verb and the explanation is not in any way responsible for interchange of the consonant in the word Brahman hm into mh as heard as pronounced. Regarding the two शिक्षा-s quoted, it has been made clear that पाणिनीय does not treat metathesis h m/n/N after h interchanged there position and instead treats the h element as औरस्य. As for the quotation from Kaundnya also it doesn't speak of an interchange between h with these clearly as the Saskritword for the interchange is विपर्यय derived from the verb विपर्येति. The statemenwto hf कौण्डिन्यशिक्षा is even more explicit -हकारान्नणमा ऊर्ध्वाः पूर्वं तु प्रसरन्ति हात् । seems emphasis on the pronunciation aspect by the use of the verb पूर्वं प्रसरन्ति. This point is to be noted based on the meaning of the verb प्रसृ than the English word metathesis or the Sanskrit विपर्यय in contrast with the ऊर्ध्वप्रसर of Kaundinya may be distinct.

And reconciliation with the औरस्य हकार may be needed or the contrast between the two has to be drawn to take a decision on these quotations regarding their pronunciation/OrthoGraph/phonograms.
