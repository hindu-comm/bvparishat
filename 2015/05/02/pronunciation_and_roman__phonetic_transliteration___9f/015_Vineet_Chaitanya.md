Namaskaara Nagaraj Paturiji,  
  

 Let me stretch my neck out and state categorically that Devanagari is a carefully designed script and it does not leave any room for ambiguities as far as order of consonants is concerned.  
  

 Order of vowel is not a problem because in the basic unit of script, there is at exactly one vowel which is always at the end. Absence of vowel is indicated by a halant marker. If there is no maatra then अ is understood. Other vowels are indicated by corresponding maatras:  
  

 A maatra is a halant_marker + corresponding vowel. (Halant marker is there to subtract the built in "अ"). e.g ि = ् + इ  
  

 As far as consonant order is concerned it is determined by top to down and left to right convention. For left to right order the consonant would be at the same level. In case of top to down case starting point of of the following consonant has to be at least a little lower. द्य is good prototype example.  
  

 I also admit that most of our Hindi knowing population is not aware of these conventions and I have seen "बुद्धि" written as "बुध्दि" which is clearly wrong.  
  

Regards
