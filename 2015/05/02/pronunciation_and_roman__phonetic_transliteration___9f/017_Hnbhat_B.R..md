I read Prof. Deshpande's recent message after I posted my reply. The cases quoted as examples are not at all like those under discussion which he made clear. And in the cases of external sandhi only the rules quoted. It is as follows :

8-3-26*हे मपरे*वा. काशिका. हकारे मकारपरे परतो मकारस्य वा मकार आदेशो भवति। किं ह्मलयति, किम् ह्मलयति। कथं ह्मलयति, कथम् ह्मलयति। यवलपरे यवला वा। यवलपरे हकारे मकारस्य यवला यथासङ्ख्यं वा भवन्ति इति वक्तव्यम्। किय्म्\\उ0310 ह्यः, किं ह्यः।

There is already म् in the preceding word for which m is substituted in the case of clusters m, l, etc. And it is optional with अनुस्वार and म्
and not between h transposed with m.

In the case of ब्रह्मन the derivational process derivation ation अ for the न् represented by अनुस्वार and it is not the reason for correctness of m+h in the word as it is clear from the derivation given in उणादि :

ब्र(व्र)ह्मन्¦न० वृं ह--मनिन्“वृंहेर्नोऽच्चेति”उणा० नकारस्या-  
कारे ऋतो रत्वम् । १ देवे“तस्मादेत्दु ब्रह्म नाम रूपमन्नञ्च  
जायते श्रुतिः”।“तेन ब्रह्म हृदा”भाग० १ । १ । १ ।

The above is the derivation given in वाचस्यत्य.  
To be clear the derivational process is as follows:

The root has बृनह n added to the original form of the root बृहि as per इदितो नुम् धातोः which makes बृह् into बृंह् with अनुस्वार whenever followed by a consonant and here it h and it cannot be बृम्ह in and case to make the word as bramha. It is clear in clear in the verbal forms of the verb. Now coming to the derivation as per the quoted rule of Shakatayana, this augmented न् in the root itself replaced by the short vowel अ and the suffix added is मन्\[इन्\] :

बृ+अauthother c न् = ब्र्+अ+ह्+मन् == ब्रह्मन्

There is no possibility of म्ह as per the above derivation and it is only according to Kaundinya Shiksha that metathesis seems to happen as it is interpreted in Tue posts it is quote and this is against the शिक्षा of Panini quoted. Both refer to the pronunciation of the ह् clusters differently. And without resolving which one is authentic and the real articulation and pronunciation of the औरस्य हकार it will be difficult to decide by arguments which one pronounced is correct and this leads finally the choice of one of the two शिक्षा-s as authentic and the other unauthenticated or accepting both as optional  
which is impossible till the pronunciation of औरस्यहकार differentiated from कण्ठ्यहकार.
