Thanks Prof. Deshpande.



I will check in Libraries.



Do you have any information on whether there is any empirical study ordocumentation of the19th/20th/21st century state of affairs with regard to this in Vedic recitations, Sanskrit scripture-recitations, gurukula teacher-studentconversations in Sanskritetc. in different parts of India including the north-western frontier region?



Metathesis seems to be the widely prevalent tendency. If this is true, what could be the reason behind all the roman/phonetic transliterations following the non-metathesis version? This is the question which prompted me to ponder over the issue.



You are the best source for a right understanding in this regard.



Thanks in advance for help.
