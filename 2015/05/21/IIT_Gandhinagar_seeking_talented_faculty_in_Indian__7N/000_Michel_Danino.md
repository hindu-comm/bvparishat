Respected scholars,



IIT Gandhinagar invites talented candidates to faculty positions in Indian knowledge systems. In the second category, candidates should have strong foundations in Indian languages and thought systems, preferably with some ability to study / discuss / critique Western paradigms, especially when they deal with India, humanities and social sciences.



All Indian knowledge systems are potentially of interest, in particular history of science and technology (with a focus on India). I attach an advertisement published recently in *Current Science*; please see the last paragraph. Besides, the following links carry further information as well as a link to the page where an online application can be made:
