Why Purana all darsanas are Subject to paraspara virodhi vyākhyānas/opinions. It is for the defender in Indian System of philosophy who considers his views as the only view, tries to reconciles contradictions in the Upanishads or the opponents system of thought. Apart from the mimasikas I donot think any Darshanas apart from paying a lip sympathy discusses Vedas at all. The Vedanta systems discusses Upanishads.  
  

Panini developed a System of Grammar based on a study of language prevalent during his times. Later traditionalists try to accommodate subsequent changes to suit Paninis rules. There were many other grammatical systems apart from Panini. So why make Panini a rishi and every one else a lesser mortal. The notion that we once a golden age and things have deteriorated from then if removed from many scholars thinking further progress and research be possible. Else one simply one can wait for the next golden age to arrive and meditate till then!!
