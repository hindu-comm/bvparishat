\~\~ śrī-śrī-rādhā-dāmodarāya namaḥ \~\~  
  
my pranamas to the vidvaj-janas.  
  
Some comments by respected Dr. Sri Korada (in italics) and my comments:

  
  
***2. Panini himself compiled a सूत्रम् - पृषोदरादीनि यथोपदिष्टम् (6-1-109)  
  
Those शब्दs not covered in अष्टाध्यायी but are being used by शिष्टs of आर्यावर्त (and also those who migrated to other parts of India) can be taken .***  
  

My comment: The actual sūtra number is 6-3-109. In the mahābhāṣya, Sri Patanjali goes to a great extent in defining a शिष्ट:. My humble opinion in this regard is that he does not consider places outside his defined boundary to be suitable for śiṣṭas. Otherwise, a person having learnt vyākaraṇa in Āryāvarta and then migrating to a foreign country outside India will also be considered as a śiṣṭa:  
  
kaiḥ punaḥ upadiṣṭāḥ? (These 'pṛṣodara etc' words are instructed by whom?)  
  
śiṣṭaiḥ. (By śiṣṭas)  
  
ke punaḥ śiṣṭāḥ? (Again, who are the śiṣṭas?)  
  
vaiyākaraṇāḥ (Grammarians)  
  
kutaḥ etat (How come?)  
  
śāstrapūrvikā hi śiṣṭiḥ vaiyākaraṇāḥ ca śāstrajñāḥ. (Good instructions come only from the śāstra, and grammarians are knowers of the śāstra \[therefore approach a śiṣṭa grammarian\]).  
  
yadi tarhi śāstrapūrvikā śiṣṭiḥ śiṣṭipūrvakam ca śāstram tat itaretarāśrayam bhavati. (If this is the case then good instruction will come from a śiṣṭa who knows the śāstra and śāstra says 'depend on śiṣṭa'. This will lead to a fault of interdependence)  
  
itaretarāśrayāṇi ca na prakalpante. (Such interdependence does not lead to a proper conclusion)  
  
evam tarhi nivāsataḥ ācārataḥ ca. (Alright then \[another definition of śiṣṭa is that\] people who stay in a pure place and have pure behavior are śiṣṭas)  
  
saḥ ca ācāraḥ āryāvartte eva. (This pure place where pure behavior is found is known certainly as Āryāvarta)  
  
kaḥ punaḥ āryāvarttaḥ. (What again is Āryāvarta?)  
  
prāk ādarśāt pratyak kālakavanāt dakṣiṇena himavantam uttareṇa pāriyātram. etasmin āryanivāse ye brāhmaṇāḥ kumbhīdhānyāḥ alolupāḥ agṛhyamāṇakāraṇāḥ kim cit antareṇa kasyāḥ cit vidyāyāḥ pāragāḥ tatrabhavantaḥ śiṣṭāḥ (The area marked by ādarśa in the west, kālaka-vana in the east, himālayas in the north and pāriyātra (vindhya) in the south is known as āryāvarta.)

***This is followed by the Western Linguistics . It is just a guess -- तर्कः / ऊहः / अनुमानप्रमाणम् and one can /should not depend upon --***

***If you follow historical way there will be the word वचन्ति - but Patanjali says न हि वचिः अन्तिपरः प्रयुज्यते !!***

***धर्म cannot stand by mere हेतुवाद , without वेद and स्मृतिs , - even sages have their ज्ञानम् rooted in वेद***  
  

This same thing is said in the brahma-sūtra (tarko 'pratiṣṭhaḥ) and in detail in the Mahābhārata where the conclusion is — mahājano yena gataḥ sa panthaḥ

  

My personal conclusion in this regard is that only by devotion to guru and the Lord does any true knowledge manifest — yasya deve parā bhaktir yathā deve tathā gurau tasyaite kathitā hy arthāḥ prakāśante mahātmanāḥ (Śvetāśvatara 6.23)  
  

***The unfortunate situation is that we have people who study more ’about Panin” rather than”Panini’ and this race is increasing day by day .***

***

***Patanjali (1-1-1) cautions - न यथा लोके तथा व्याकरणे - प्रमाणभूतः आचार्यः दर्भपवित्रपाणिः ... महता प्रयत्नेन सूत्राणि प्रणयति स्म । तत्र
अशक्यं वर्णेनाप्यनर्थकेन भवितुम् , किमियता सूत्रेण ?***

  
This is true. Pāṇini Muni created sūtras with great effort and even half a syllable is not without meaning, what to speak of an entire sūtra? However, later Sri Patanjali too seems to take to logic. In some sūtras Sri Patanjali says that if a particular term would be omitted then too the sūtra would work.  
  

***Many so called scholars / teachers do not want to learn a single शस्त्रम् completely with a गुरु - forget about other शास्त्रs .  
***

***  
***

***वेद is forgotten long ago - without looking into the available Vedic and secular literature , I fail to understand , as to how can one say that Panini erred or should have done better .  
  
***

There is no ahaitukī-bhāva in most of the teachers and students. This is not something new. In earlier times too, the pralobhana of a rājya-pada produced similar situations. Regarding the Vedas, many scholars do not realize what they will achieve spiritually by understanding the Vedas. If the maximum that can be achieved is svarga or parama-pada, then there are other śāstras which promise the same through various other easier means. Veda is the difficult path, and even the bhagavad-gītā seems to suggest that. Moreover, the situation has worsened after the various commentators of the Veda have given vyākhyās which are paraspara-virodhī. Therefore many vidvaj-janas (especially in the northern parts of India) suggest itihāsa-purāṇa to be the solution.
