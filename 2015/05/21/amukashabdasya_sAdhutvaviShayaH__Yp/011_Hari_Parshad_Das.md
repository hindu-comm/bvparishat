respected dr. korada,  
  

my pranams.  
  

your comment: ***is not the itihāsa-purāṇa category too subject to paraspara virodhi vyākhyānas/opinions?***  
  

I say humbly that my aim was not to discredit any study of the Vedas. I was merely trying to state the current situation.  
  
In the case of itihasas like Mahabharata, there is only one prominent commentator (Sri Nilakantha). In the case of Puranas too, the one prominent commentator is Sripad Sridhar Swami, who fits the criteria of a śiṣṭa as defined by Sri Patanjali. Most other commentators respect his opinion as the final and authoritative one. Even if someone disagrees with him in some cases, it is not taken seriously by most Paurāṇikas. The situation is much better in the case of itihāsa/purāṇa also because the language is easier to comprehend.  
  
In the case of the Vedas however, the following issues are existing:  
  

1\) **duṣpāratva** — some portions are 'ucchanna' (not available) and some are 'pracchanna' (not commented upon). This is not the case with the purāṇas/itihāsa.  
  

2\) **duradhigama-artha** — difficult to study especially with no universal agreement on the svara-markings. Svara-markings are not present in the purāṇas/itihāsa.  
  

3\) **paraspara-virodha** — nyāya/vaiśeṣika/mīmāṁsā etc. schools all attempt to explain the Veda but unity is not achieved sometimes even on basic points. This is not the case with the purāṇa/itihāsa.  
  

Therefore many vidvāns emphasize that complete Vedic understanding occurs by studying the explanations given in the itihāsa/purāṇa (itihāsa-purāṇābhyāṁ vedaṁ samupabrṁhayet — Mahābhārata).  
  

Once again, please let this not be taken as a disrespect of those who have dedicated their lives to Veda. Those who study the Veda will derive immense benefit by taking into consideration the Puranas and Itihasas.  

  

sādhu-caraṇa-rajo 'bhilāṣī,
