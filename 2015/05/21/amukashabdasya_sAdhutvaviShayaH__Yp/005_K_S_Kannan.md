I think there is good sense in the last comment of Prof Aklujkar.

  

For, what is *prAtipadikam*, after all ?

Dissolve : *pratipadam bhavam* ?

What does it mean?

What occurs in all the *pada*-s that occur.

And where ?

In the multitude of declensional forms, of course.

= the GCF (Greatest Common Factor) of all the declensional forms!

  

So then, in order to be an *anvartha*-*samjn"A,*

the method would demand a reconstruction starting from the GCF, *ab initio*,

for there lies **economy**.

Isn't economy the very life-breath of Sanskrit grammarians?

Or at least as the reputation goes?

  

And especially for those who exclaimed and grudged and bewailed

*kAraka iti **mahatI** samjn"A,*

the impulse to mete out greater justice to *"prAtipadika"-samjn"A"*

should have been greater.

  

For, like "*kAraka"*, this one too cries out to be an *anvartha-samjn"A*,

more so because it is even bigger a *samjn"A* !

  

All said, we must satisfy ourselves by resorting to *bhUyastva-nimmittaka-vyapades'a*,

which is quite justifiable, after all! :

*prAdhAnyena hi vyapades'A bhavanti !*

If the designation worked well with over 90% of the cases, that goes well!

  

Did Panini then ignore newer positing of bases in deference to his predecessors here too?

- is a question worth its perusal.

  

Any improvement on my position, or even its nullification, is most welcome.
