Speaking offhand, I guess in a good many *sarvanAma*-*s'abda*-s,

the *prAtipadika*-form is the one that comes closest to the nominative singular form in the Neuter.

  

For example, we see***tad*** is the common base for all the three genders

(for*sah*etc,*sA*etc,***tat***etc.).

  

So with *kim*, *etad* etc.

  

There is a pattern, if not uniformity, here.
