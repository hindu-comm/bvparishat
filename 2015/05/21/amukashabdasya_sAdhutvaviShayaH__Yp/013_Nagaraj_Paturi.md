Let us not allow the beautiful academic discussion of a highly interesting issue raised by Pujya Swamiji to digress into never resolvable strong opinions.



A highly interesting way of looking at 'amuka' s'abda presented by Prof. Deshpande, equally interesting responses from Professors Aklujkar and Kannan are all as legitimate academic approaches as that of Prof. Korada or Vidwan Hari Parshad Dasji.



Sometimes some unpleasant comments about the relative superiority of traditional and modern methodologies are unnecessarily leading to unhealthy digressions from the main theme.



This may not cause pleasant feelings in thread initiators like Pujya Swamiji.
