There is another way of looking at the form "amuka". Linguistically speaking, if one takes a look at the paradigms of "adas", one can notice that 95+ percent of forms of "adas" contain the morph "am-" (as in amū, amī, etc.) while the form "adas" is seen only in the neuter nominative singular. What that shows is that the historically basic morph in all these forms is "amū/ī", and it is from that basic morph that the word "amuka" is derived. So the form "amuka" is genetically connected with the primary morph seen in the forms of "adas", and hence is historically not an independent avyutpanna form as explained by the traditional commentaries. Among the forms of "adas", "as-" is seen only in "asau", "adas" is seen only in "adaḥ", while all other forms contain "am-". It is not clear to me why the morph "adas" was chosen by Pāṇini to represent the base form for this word, when it is so rare in the paradigms themselves.
