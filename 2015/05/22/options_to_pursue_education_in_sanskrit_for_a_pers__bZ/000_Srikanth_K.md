Hello All,  
 I wanted to check if members in the forum can help identiy any courses that could be pursued by a person who though is conversant in sanskrit and vedas does not hold any formal certificates.  
  
 Example, for people interested in Hindi, there is "Hindi Prachar Sabha" where one can enroll and take up exams and at their pace.  
 Are there any such institutions for sanskrit. I am aware of samskrita bharathi, but I assume that this is more to get familiar with the language and does not get too much into sub-subjects within it like tarkha, vyakarana etc.  
  
 Any information(or reference) would be highly appreciated.  
Thanks  
Srikanth
