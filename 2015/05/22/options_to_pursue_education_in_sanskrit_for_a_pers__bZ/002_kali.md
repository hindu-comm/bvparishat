HariH OM!

  

Namaste,

  

There are many universities where sanskrit education is formalized.

  

1. Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan, a Deemed University, established by HRD ministry of GOI offer Degrees & PG degrees - <http://www.sanskrit.nic.in/>

  

2. Rashtriya Sanskrit Vidyapeetha, Tirupati, another institution offering formal education in sanskrit.- <http://rsvidyapeetha.ac.in/>

  

Both these sources are convenient to pursue higher formal education in samskritam.

  

Hopefully this info is useful.

  

DhanyavadaH
