Namasty,  
In sanskrit there is a chittur exams. They are conducting exams in 6 levels. Duration is 6 months for each level. If u have facing trouble to attand all papers at a time, then you have to select papers as you wish and complete the level. It is subject oriented so you gaim the knowledge about shastras also.

With Regards
