Srikanth ji Namo Namah,

  

I know earlier mentioned Rastriya Sankrit Sansthan (RSS) could be of help, because I am also non-formal Sanskrit background and pursuing Acharya. They have Mukt Swadhyaay Peeth (MSP), which is actually a Distance Learning Center, approved by IGNOU.

  

In RSS, Anyone who has a Graduation Degree (for admission to Acharya) (in any subject), and has knowledge of Sanskrit on his own, with his own efforts/ Gurukul etc. Could take admission to a Bridge course and then could be admitted to Shastri/ Acharya as the case be.

  

For Acharya Bridge course - Graduation in any subject (and knowledge of Sanskrit)

For Shastri Bridge course - +2 in any subject (and knowledge of Sanskrit)

  

For more information, consult RSS website ([www.sanskrit.nic.in](http://www.sanskrit.nic.in)) and talk to RSS at given number on the website.

  

Thanks,

Alankar Sharma
