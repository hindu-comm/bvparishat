Dear list members

  

The **Bhuśuṇḍi Rāmāyaṇa**with a Hindi translation by Ācārya Jaṭāśaṅkara Dīkṣita is out. The book runs into 1,344 pages. The price is Rs. 1,450 including postage (for buyers in India only).

  

Those interested may get in touch with the publisher Bhuvan Vani Trust, Lucknow. Their contact can be found in the flyer and catalogue I posted earlier in this thread.

  

Thanks, Nityanand
