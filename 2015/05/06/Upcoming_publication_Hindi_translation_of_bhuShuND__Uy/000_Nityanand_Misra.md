Namaste  
  

Bhuvan Vani Trust (भुवन वाणी ट्रस्ट), Lucknow, is about to bring out a Hindi translation of the Bhuṣuṇḍī Rāmāyaṇa. The work has been translated by Ācārya Jaṭāśaṅkara Dīkṣita, and would be available in a few weeks' time. I have attached a two page flyer for the translation, along with the catalogue of Bhuvan Vani Trust. Those interested may get in touch with them directly.  

  

Thanks, Nityānanda
