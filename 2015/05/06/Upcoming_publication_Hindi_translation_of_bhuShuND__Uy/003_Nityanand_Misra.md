Correct, **Bhuśuṇḍi Rāmāyaṇa**as per the title of the book.

  

[Monier Williams](http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/cgi-bin/monier/serveimg.pl?file=/scans/MWScan/MWScanjpg/mw0760-bhuJjApaya.jpg) lists four spellings (bhuṣuṇḍi, bhuṣuṇḍī, bhūśuṇḍi, and bhūśuṇḍī) under bhuśuṇḍi.

*(H1) bhuśuṇḍi \[p= 760,1\] \[L=151454\] f. a kind of weapon (perhaps fire-arms ; also written bhuṣuṇḍi , ḍī , and bhūśuṇḍi , °ḍī) MBh. R. &c*
