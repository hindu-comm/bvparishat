Namaste,  
  

Before going to Jāmbavān, it may help to look at Sugriva. Sugriva is called a monkey and his cave is said to be near Hampi in Karnataka and there was a forest,next to it in the ancient times. All this probably means that he was caveman, staying on the outskirts of a forest and got food for his family by gathering fruits and roots / tubers etc. from the forest. As regards his tail, it could be that he kept a rope (tied to his waist, which he could tie to the tree so that he would not fall from the tree, while gathering fruits. It could be that the other people called these cavemean monkeys for living on forest-food and sporting the tails. The other people obviously were agrarian people and they did not have to depend on forest-food.the Anekunda village, near the Sugriva's cave, there are the Vant families, who claim to be descendents of Angad, the nephew of Sugriva, and these people are human being like all of us.  
  

Now coming to Jāmbavān, he could have been a man living in karnataka, but he could have been more like a hairy man and did not sport a tail. He could have also been omnivorous like a bear, who takes plant food as well as small animals and insects. His cave was probably like a bear-den , which the bears needed for child-birth and rearing children. These could be the reason the man like him was called bear and not monkey. After the Ramayana times he could have shifted to the Porbandar area in Gujarat as it was there where he is said to have fought with Lord Krishna and later on he gave his daughter in marriage to the Lord.
