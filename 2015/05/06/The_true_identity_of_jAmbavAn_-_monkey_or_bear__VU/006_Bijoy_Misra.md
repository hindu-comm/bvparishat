Dear Dr. Bhattacharya,  

Can you please cite a resource for the interpretation?  

Currently I am particularly intrigued by the species 'rakhshasa"  

which seem to be human-like creatures with strong body-build,  
and are haughty and impulsive. Some of them could disguise  

themselves (possibly by dress and voice) to trick others. They  

possibly took delight in drinking animal blood including human.  

I will appreciate any pointer.  

Best regards,  

Bijoy Misra
