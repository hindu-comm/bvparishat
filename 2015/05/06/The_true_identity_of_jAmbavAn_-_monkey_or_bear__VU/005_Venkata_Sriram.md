Dear Sunil Ji,  
  
There is a community in telangana called "mudiraj". They derive their geneology from vanaras.  
  

<http://mudiraja.com/mudiraju_vanaras.html>

Now, what surprises and amazes me is the knowledge of Hanuman ji. Even though a vanara, He had complete knowledge of 3 vedas and 9 vyakaranas.
So, this boils down to the question whether names "vanara", "jambavan" really denote a tribe or not / whether extinct or not ?  
  
regs,  
sriram
