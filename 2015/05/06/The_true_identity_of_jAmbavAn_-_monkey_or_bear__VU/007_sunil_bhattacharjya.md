Namaste,  
  

That is the best explanation of the vanara being cave-man, one can think of. After Mother Sita left, it is believed that, Sugriva offered his daughter Kalyani to Lord Ram. I do not have much details on that, but it surely means that Sugriva was a man and man only. However Kala (time) Himself came to Lord Ram and told the latter that he spent 11,000 years (meaning 11,000 days) on the earth and that it was time that he left for his divine abode and the Lord had to cut short his stay on the earth.
