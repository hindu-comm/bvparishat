Yes, Thank you. That was a great slip. Bear wife was Jambavati and not Satyabhama.  
  

Naga does not necessarily mean serpent only. Naga can mean a teacher and Lord Buddha was a Naga. Nagarjua was a chief of the Nagas, who, five centuries after the demise of Lord Buddha, decided to make public the esoteric teachings of Lord Buddha on the middle way. Naga can also mean people living in Hills.
