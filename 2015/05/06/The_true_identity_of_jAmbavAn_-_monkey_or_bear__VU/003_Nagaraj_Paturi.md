Dr. Ajit once suggested that we have some humour during the weekends.



This is not a weekend. Still I enjoyed the satire, coming from AadaraNIya Nityanandji after a long gap.



I said, " This is one of those attempts to link the pauranic with real historical. There have been many attempts like this about many purANa and itihAsa characters. None matches the other."



with the intention of asking the list not to take such attempts seriously only.



But a pinching way of asking not to bring such sources for discussion at all was delicately nice.
