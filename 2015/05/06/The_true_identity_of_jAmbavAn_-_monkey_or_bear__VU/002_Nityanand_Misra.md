The linked article, replete with extrordinary scholarship, unfrotunately has no author information and is hosted on a website which does not name its sholarly editor(s). Furthermore, the [About Us](http://www.sanskritimagazine.com/about-us/) page on the website says:

*Caledon-based digital entrepreneur who likes to be known just as Singh, has been running a Facebook page called SanskritiCultureOfIndia for almost a year now and has some 22000 people following it. Giving into the fan requests, he recently created an informative portal with the same information called [www.sanskritmagazine.com](http://www.sanskritmagazine.com).*  

  

Glad to know the article comes from the unparalleled scholar Mr. Singh in Caledon, who runs a popular Facebook page with 22000 followers! These are outstanding credentials I must say (only a *summa cum laude* from Harvard comes close I guess). I think this is one of the few websites that meets the [highest quality standards for online sources](https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/553/04/).  

  

Here is a much less reliable source with another view: [Puranic Encyclopedia](http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/PEScan/2014/web/webtc/servepdf.php?page=341) (Vettam Mani, MLBD, 1975, p. 341):

  

*\[Footnote: 1) It is difficult to ascertain whether Jāmbavān was a monkey or a bear. In some of the Indian languages he is descri bed as a monkey. In Malayālaṁ he was thought of as a monkey from ancient period. In Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, which is the original work, Jāmbavān is denoted by the words ‘Kapi’ (monkey) and Rkṣa (bear). Jāmbavān is called Ṛkṣapuṅgava in Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa Bālakāṇḍa Sarga 17. From this it is to be assumed that Jāmbavān was a bear. In the same chapter it occurs that, it was the aim of Brahmā to make the gods and the celestial women take birth as monkeys to help Mahāviṣṇu in the incarnation of Śrī Rāma. So it is not wrong to consider Jāmbavān either as a bear or as a monkey.\]
