This is one of those attempts to link the pauranic with real historical. There have been many attempts like this about many purANa and itihAsa characters. None matches the other.



Many human-like characters married the daughters of non-human-like characters not only in Indian mythology but in mythologies world over. This prompted researchers world over to link the species of thus married females to some real historical human race.



Many caste-origin/tribe-origin mythologies followed by the respective castes /tribes in Indiatrace the origin of the caste/tribe to one of the mythological characters, some of them being thesenon-human-like characters. This too prompts people tothink if these non-human-like characters are from somereal ancient human race.



There is, in fact,a Dalit community which, through such 'caste-origin mythology' , traces its origin to Jambavan.
