Dear list members  
  
Here is what the [Puranic Encylopedia](http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/PEScan/2014/web/webtc/servepdf.php?page=796) (Vettam Mani, MLBD, 1975, p. 796) says about Tṛṇabindu  
  
*2) How he cursed Hanūmān. Once Hanūmān caught hold of a lion and elephant in fight and tied them each to a post on the two sides of the āśrama of Tṛṇabindu. When the sage stepped out from the hermitage, he was for a moment frightened by the sight of two mighty animals on the sides of his āśrama and knew by his divine powers that the perpetrator of that deed was Hanūmān and so he cursed him saying that he would lose all his divine powers forthwith. Hanūmān begged for relief and the sage said that he would regain his powers at the time of his going in search of Sītā when another member of his species would remind him of his lost divine powers. Hanūmān remained oblivious of his powers till the time when the monkeys were trying to leap to Laṅkā from the Mahendra mountain on the shores of Bhārata. Jāmbavān, a mighty monkey chief called Hanūmān to his side and made him understand the great powers latent in him. From that moment onwards Hanūmān regained his lost powers and became his old self. (See under Hanūmān).*  
  

Mani does not cite the source, but cross-refers to the entry Hanūmān. And this is what he says under Hanūmān ([ibid, p. 308](http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/PEScan/2014/web/webtc/servepdf.php?page=308))  

  
*7) Lost his divine power. Once due to a curse of sage Tṛṇabindu Hanūmān lost his great strength and vitality. But, he would regain the lost power when one reminded him of it. During the search for Sītā Hanumān felt it difficult to jump across the southern sea to Laṅkā due to the above curse. But, when Jāmbavān described to him about his noble origin and powers Hanūmān regained his lost power and vitality, and successfully jumped across the sea to Laṅkā. (See Tṛṇabindu II, Para 2).*  
  

Again, the source is not cited. Does anybody know which work has this narrative of Tṛṇabindu and Hanumān? Is it from the Tamil Kamba Rāmāyaṇa? Mani often includes narrative from Kamba Rāmāyaṇa in the Puranic Encyclopedia.  
  
  
The Paurāṇika Kośa of Rāṇā Prasāda Śarmā (1986, Jñānamaṇḍala Limited) has has an elaborate entry on Tṛṇabindu (see attached) but does not mention the episode of him cursing Hanumān.The second chapter in the Uttarakāṇḍa of Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa mentions Tṛṇabindu but there is no mention of the curse of Hanumān.The curse of Hanumān is mentioned in the thirty-third chapter in the Uttarakāṇḍa but Tṛṇabindu is not named, the sages are identified as descendants of Bhṛgu and Aṅgirasa: ततो महर्षयः क्रुद्धा भृग्वङ्गिरसवंशजाः ॥ ७-३६-३३ ॥ शेपुरेनं रघुश्रेष्ठ नातिक्रुद्धातिमन्यवः । बाधसे यत्समाश्रित्य बलमस्मान् प्लवङ्गम ॥ ७-३६-३४ ॥ तद्दीर्घकालं वेत्तासि नास्माकं शापमोहितः । यदा ते स्मार्यते कीर्तिः तदा ते वर्धते बलम् ॥ ७-३६-३५ ॥
