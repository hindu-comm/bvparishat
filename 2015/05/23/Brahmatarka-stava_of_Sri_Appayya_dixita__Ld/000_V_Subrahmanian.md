Namaste  
  

The 'Brahmatarka-stava' of Sri Appayya Diká¹£ita is a work of verses with an auto-commentary. I would like to know if this work is available on the internet for download. Also, is there any translation of this work in English or Hindi or any other South Indian language?  
  

warm regards
