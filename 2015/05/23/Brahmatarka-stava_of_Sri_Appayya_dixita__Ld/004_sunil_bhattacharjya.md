One thing baffles me. For Advaitin there is only the Brahman and one realizes that Lord Shiva and Lord Vishnu are the same. The message from the Mahabharata also is the same. Arjuna prayed to Lord Shiva saying that Shiva is Vishnuroopi and Vishnu is Shiva-roopi. In Bhagavad Gita also the Lord in the Yogayukta state, tells us that he is Vishnu, he is Shiva, he is everything and he is both Sat and Asat (manifested and unmanifested). So whoever has read the Mahabharata and the Bhagavad Gita properly would not think Lord Vishnu and Lord Shiva to be different (in the paramarthic sense). Such being the case the great Advaitin need not have composed the 56 verses of the Brahmatarkastava to prove to the sceptics that Lord Shiva is no less than lord Vishnu.
