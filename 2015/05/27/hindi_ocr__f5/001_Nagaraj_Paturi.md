There are many threads on BVP which discussed OCR issue. Please do topic search.



Foe example, once AadaraNIya Nityanandji posted as follows:



I have tried Dr. Hellwig's product for Sanskrit OCR and it is very good indeed.

  

I believe CDAC developed a Hindi OCR. I think this is the page -<http://ildc.in/htm/ocr_spell.htm> (an old version), and they have something here -<http://cdac.in/index.aspx?id=mc_ocr_ocr> which deals with multiple scripts. Maybe Dr. Ramanujan can comment the state of these projects.



Some people wrote that you may use Google drive for this purpose.



If you search on BVP, you will find a few more.
