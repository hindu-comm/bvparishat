Dear Palash,



Are you a UGC JRF/SRF holder? (Did you pass out the UGC JRF examination?) Is your scholarship being provided to you under UGC JRF/SRF scheme?



If your scholarship is being provided to you not under UGC JRF/SRF scheme, if it is a separate scholarship provided by your university, the amounts are not controlled by UGC. The amounts are fixed by each university in their own way. Such amounts are not uniform.



Only UGC JRF/SRF amounts are uniform throughout the country.
