If you have not yet passed out, I advise please clear the UGC JRF examination.



UGC has recently (announced on 1st December, 2014) increased the JRF amount from Rs.16000/- per month to Rs. 25000/- per month. SRF amount has been increased from Rs.18000/- per month to Rs. 28000/- per month.



Once you clear your UGC JRF examination, and you begin to draw your fellowship, you will draw JRF amount for the first two years and SRF amount for the next two years.
