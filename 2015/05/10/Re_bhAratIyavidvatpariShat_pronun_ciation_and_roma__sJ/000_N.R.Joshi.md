Dear Dr. H.N.Bhat,



Thanks for explaining two varieties of H kaara. In our traditional Sanskrit VarNamala, the first five rows ( K varga to P varga) are tabulated very well. But remaining Varnas (semivowels) like Y, V, R. V
and sibilants are simply listed. Is there any reason for that? Where could we add two H kaaras in the existing VarNamala? Thanks. N.R.Joshi.

\> There is good discussion on 'M' kaara and 'H' kaara in words like Brahman etc. Please kindly give me two Sanskrit words (Devanagari and Roman) of each

\(1\) H kaara occurs as Aurasya and two words where it occurs as kanthya.  
  

Paniniya शिक्षा clearly says the हकार in conjunct with the fifth letters of the वर्ग-s is औरस्य and in other cases it is pronounced as कण्ठ्य.

So for your count of two, already three occurrences are already given for औरस्य. All the other cases where ह् occurs in words isolated or in conjunct other than those mentioned (if any) is considered as कण्ठ्य.

The other words जिह्म, ब्राह्मी, ब्राह्मणः etc. for औरस्य. The declensions of the word अहन् like अह्ना, अह्नः, अह्नि and the compound form in the final position as prescribed by the rule अह्नो√ह्न एतेभ्यः are the further examples.

I need not give other examples of कण्ठय हकार dictionaries as you can find so many words in the uer the letter ह.

\> Second question--It was suggested that one may write Sanskrit word Gangaa by using the nasal (as we write using diacritical mark in Roman) instead a dot (Anuswaara) on the top line of the word.

\> In that case how shall we write in Devanagari the words like Hansa (swan), Samshaya (doubt) or Samskritawithout dot on the top? Thanks . NRJOSHI

I think Dr. Dhaval has replied your question precisely. In all the other cases than those listed, the अनुस्वार will remain as it is including those you have asked. This is according to the grammatical analysis than the rules of pronunciation being discussed.

\> I have already given the derivation of the word from the same root grammatically as usual or derived which eliminates the न्- म् - ं - element in the root to get the form बृहि - बृन्हि - बृंहि - बृंह् up to ब्रह्मन् while suffixing मनिन् = मन् the न् after the ृ in the root element replaced by अ which makes ब्रह्मन् finally and it is not lost in the formation of बृंह्+अन -- बृंहण in the process of derivation. Vacaspati only emphasizes on the meaning of the verb बृंहण = वृद्धि attached to the verb and the explanation is not in any way responsible for interchange of the consonant in the word Brahman hm into mh as heard as pronounced. Regarding the two शिक्षा-s quoted, it has been made clear that पाणिनीय does not treat metathesis h m/n/N after h interchanged there position and instead treats the h element as औरस्य. As for the quotation from Kaundnya also it doesn't speak of an interchange between h with these clearly as the Saskritword for the interchange is विपर्यय derived from the verb विपर्येति. The statemenwto hf कौण्डिन्यशिक्षा is even more explicit -हकारान्नणमा ऊर्ध्वाः पूर्वं तु प्रसरन्ति हात् । seems emphasis on the pronunciation aspect by the use of the verb पूर्वं प्रसरन्ति. This point is to be noted based on the meaning of the verb प्रसृ than the English word metathesis or the Sanskrit विपर्यय in contrast with the ऊर्ध्वप्रसर of Kaundinya may be distinct.

\> And reconciliation with the औरस्य हकार may be needed or the contrast between the two has to be drawn to take a decision on these quotations regarding their pronunciation/OrthoGraph/phonograms.
