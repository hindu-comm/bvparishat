Namaste Joshi ji

  

1\. Your objections on Professor. Koradas post are of two categories:

  

1a) doubting ' ateendriya' premise

  

1b) challenging the lack of practical proof and historical verifiability of application of ' veda mantra - derived solutions' for health care et al.

  

2\. Ateendriya perception is NOT limited to space- time- history- nationality- parentage- profession constraints; or even this earth in a small segment if solar system(- surya mandala). Instead of asking why such a ' faith- hypothesis-premise(?)' forms the foundation of veda- yoga- Samskrutham tradition, why not explore the prescribed path which leads to the ateendriya (- transcending sensory gates of knowledge; provides far greater perception and clarity than what mechanical instruments can provide)? The yoga system is about refining human system using vedas; tantra and aagama(- and jyotisha- ayurveda) are about refining ' pancha bhoota gunas , postulated as common cosmic constituents for all creation - matter and consciousness together ).

  

Modern Sciences, including Health and life sciences have only postulates about common matter constituents for all creation; the element if life- consciousness (prana chaitanya) and mind ( manas) are kept out of any meaningful dialogue!

  

Thus there is a wide fundamental divide between the two systems in terms of postulates, primary concepts, methodology - all of which is a result of bad understanding of Samskrutham through faulty translations and constricted yoga practices which do not meet even the elementary qualifications to access ' veda- practicals for curative measures' set in Bhagavadgita ( as a Yoga discourse in Sanskrit).

  

While your objections are totally valid , concerns about the failure of india to deliver socially relevant economically viable solutions, failure of tradition to keep pace with globalization and advances in material and health sciences- All appreciated, it does not give a ground for short interpretation of source works.

  

We may not know why ancients postulated ateendriya principle; and tradition values it for preservation; but as current period intellectuals with a concern, what prevents us from doing a re-engineering / reverse engineering of the given traditional paradigm ?
The concept of open discussion on a forum does not mean it is free- of- charge information (- with scholars talking high from head over a hungry stomach) .

  

The success here will come ' by giving a benefit of doubt about the plausibility of the given traditional hypothesis as True', rather than starting with a negative attitude and devising ways to prove the ' falsity of tradition'. What if tradition is true? The biggest losers will be drug and Pharma business houses. The biggest gain will be for indian vedic sanskrit practitioners. This is a scary fear that lurks behind many to pursue this path with any sincerity of heart and proper support!

  

It is the second part that scientists like you should bring in as a contribution on this forum and facilitate a dialogue.

  

To begin with how about mapping the meaning of the upasarga' ati' and concept of ' indriya' in the given word ateendriya? And then go to the word ' ateendriya pratyaksha'? Afterwards one can go for the upasarga prati in pratyaksha?!
