Prof S. Korada, Saadara PraNaama!



SUBJECT-AtIndriyaJnanam and Yogipratryksha reffered to in your posting.assume that Dras't'aa Rishis who saw (or heard Vedas) were also endowed with AtIndriya Jnanam and Yogipratryksha. In Vedas there is mundane information. Is it necessary to have Yogipratyaksha capacity to refer to countries of the world included in Vedas. Rigveda has name of Devapi from Mahabharata. Atharvdas has mantra on Takman (Maleria). The mantra says let Takman go west to Vaahlikas Gaandaaras and Mahavris'as and east Angadesha. These are the names of the countries. What the objective knowledge only accessible through Yogipratyaksha has to do with countries mantioned in Mahabharata? A girl from Kirata tribe (Himalayas) knew Vanaspati that could cure patient of Maleria. No role of Atharva mantra in this cure . That Maleria was killing people of India from Vedic times to this day. And those sages who saved Vedas word by word and kept Atharveda mantras intact--it did not work. People from a village in India near Himalayan boundary were suffering from Maleria. Briitish governer of that area saw the situation and he drained all accumulating waters of that place. Maleria stopped and people of the village got Mukti from the killing Maleria. So they raised the statue of the governer in the village and talk in very respectful manner about him this. Atharva Veda mantras are available from thousands of years and India had Sages with Yogi Pratyaksha from thousands of years. But they could not stop killing of British soldiers by Maleria. The discovery of drug Quinine stpped it-not Atharva veda mantra. Sobari KaaNva in ancient India was complaing about mice who were eating his oblation dravya of fire ritual. British were distributing cages to Indian population to catch mice. Thousands of mice from Vietnam were killed by French soldiers during their stay in Vietnam. So what is the use of Yogipratyaksha and their compositions. If you say chanting those composition make peoplefree and they get Mukti from this Maayaa, then no further question

Subject: Re: {भारतीयविद्वत्परिषत्} अमुकशब्दस्य साधुत्वविषयः  
Date: Fri, 22 May 2015 22:44:04 +0530  
  

नमो विद्वद्भ्यः



The following discussion is not intended to offend / criticize any one.



What is the question ?



अमुकशब्दः असाधुः इति प्रौढमनोरमाकारः । But we come across usage of the same शब्द by शिष्टाः --



While teaching  गृह्यसूत्रम् to  my children / disciples I say the following -



अमुकं कर्म करिष्यमाणः तदादौ शुध्यर्थं वृद्ध्यर्थं शान्त्यर्थम् अभ्युदयार्थं च महाजनैः सह स्वस्तिपुण्याहवाचनं करिष्ये ।



The children / disciples go elsewhere and on the proper occasion say the following --



पाणिग्रहणाख्यं कर्म करिष्यमाणः तदादौ शुद्ध्यर्थं ...... करिष्ये ।



There has been uninterrupted tradition of गुरु and शिष्य spanning for thousands of years in our family - in terms of both आचार and स्वाध्याय ।



Then what to do ?



There are devices offered in शास्त्रम् -



1\. There can be some शब्दs which are not covered by Panini but acceptable to other आचार्यs and they can be accepted if शिष्टप्रयोग is there - 'एकदेशानुमतिद्वारा....’ प्रौढमनो -- this is indicated by Panini by the usage - सातत्ये ( अपरस्पराः क्रियासातत्ये पा)



2\. Panini himself compiled a सूत्रम् - पृषोदरादीनि यथोपदिष्टम् (6-1-109)



Those शब्दs not covered in अष्टाध्यायी but are being used by शिष्टs of आर्यावर्त (and also those who migrated to other parts of India) can be taken .



3\. There are some आकृतिगणs - those which are not covered in the गण but are there in वेद or लोक can also be accepted .



4\. Panini follows both व्युत्पत्तिपक्ष and अव्युत्पत्तिपक्ष ( अतः कृकमि ... ; अयामन्ता.. ; ’प्रातिपदिकविज्ञानाच्च आणिनेः सिद्धम्’ भाष्यम् under आयनेयी..) -

’उत्तमशब्दः अव्युत्पन्नः ’ - भाष्यम् under अणिञोरनार्षयोः ;

’ उद्गतं तमः यस्मात् सः उत्तमः’ - श्रीधरव्याख्यानम् - भागवतम् ।



So some words that have been there in शिष्टप्रयोग may be accepted following अव्युत्पत्तिपक्ष ।



So following अव्युत्पत्तिपक्ष , the term अमुक can be used .



According to प्रौढमनोरमा , अ takes 18 अकारs following निरूढलक्षणा - this is not right - why and how ?

Following the न्यायसूत्रम् - जात्याकृतिव्यक्तयस्तु पदार्थः - I can get it .

लक्षणा is पददोष and वाक्यभेद is वाक्यदोष -- मीमांसकाः।



So one need not blindly follow any traditional commentator.





What about historical way ?



This is followed by the Western Linguistics . It is just a guess -- तर्कः / ऊहः / अनुमानप्रमाणम् and one can /should not depend upon --



If you follow historical way there will be the word वचन्ति - but Patanjali says न हि वचिः अन्तिपरः प्रयुज्यते !!



Hari in ब्रह्मकाण्ड of वाक्यपदीयम् discusses this aspect at length --



यत्नेनानुमितो’प्यर्थः कुशलैः अनुमातृभिः ।

अभियुक्ततरैः अन्यैः अन्यथैवोपपद्यते ॥ 34



This verse is so popular that Samkaracarya quoted this in prose and Vacaspati of Bamati in verse under तर्काप्रतिष्ठानात् (ब्र सू).



प्रतिष्ठितः तर्कः प्रमाणमेव - for Samkaracarya.



You worked hard and arrived at a decision thru inference - tomorrow there will be a better logician than you and may propose another form and there is no end.



There is one अभ्यासप्रमाणम् ,thru which gems , gold etc are marked and it cannot be explained to others - it is not inferential --



परेषाम् असमाख्येयम् अभ्यासादेव जायते ।

मणिरूप्यादिविज्ञानं , तद्विदां नानुमानिकम् ॥ 35



 धर्म cannot stand by mere हेतुवाद , without वेद and स्मृतिs , - even sages have their ज्ञानम् rooted in वेद --



नचागमादृते धर्मः तर्केण व्यवतिष्ठते ।

ऋषीणामपि यज्ज्ञानं तदप्यागमपूर्वकम् ॥ 30



A logician , just like a blind person , who runs on an uneven place by
the touch of hand , would certainly have a great fall --



हस्तस्पर्शादिवान्धेन विषमे पथि धावता ।

अनुमानप्रधानेन विनिपातो न दुर्लभः ॥ 42



अदृष्टम् - another प्रमाणम् has to be accepted - it is just like our प्रत्यक्षम् and the ऋषिs , who are above रजस् and तमस् have such अतीन्द्रियज्ञानम् (योगिप्रत्यक्षम्) --



आविर्भूतप्रकाशानाम् अनुपप्लुतचेतसाम् ।

अतीतानागतज्ञानं प्रत्यक्षान्न विशिष्यते॥ 37



Finally the logician is not a match to ऋषिs , who have योगिदृष्टि --



अतीन्द्रियान् असंवेद्यान् पश्यन्त्यार्षेण चक्षुषा ।

ये भावान् , वचनं तेषां नानुमानेन बाध्यते ॥ 38



The unfortunate situation is that we have people who study more ’about Panin” rather than”Panini’ and this race is increasing day by day .



Patanjali (1-1-1) cautions - न यथा लोके तथा व्याकरणे - प्रमाणभूतः आचार्यः दर्भपवित्रपाणिः ... महता प्रयत्नेन सूत्राणि प्रणयति स्म । तत्र
अशक्यं वर्णेनाप्यनर्थकेन भवितुम् , किमियता सूत्रेण ?



Today we have people who study a couple of Paninisutras and write a paper .



Many so called scholars / teachers do not want to learn a single शस्त्रम् completely with a गुरु - forget about other शास्त्रs .



वेद is forgotten long ago - without looking into the available Vedic and secular literature , I fail to understand , as to how can one say that Panini erred or should have done better .



धन्यो’स्मि
