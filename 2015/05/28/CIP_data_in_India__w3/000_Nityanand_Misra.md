Dear list members  
  

D K Agencies in New Delhi provides Cataloguing in Publicadata for publishers in India, and claim to be the largest bibliographic data services agency.  
  
<http://www.dkagencies.com/Cataloguing-In-Publication-Data.aspx>  
  
Has anybody on their used their CIP data before publishing their books or while acquiring books?  
  
How helpful is their CIP data especially for books on Sanskrit, Indology, and Indian literature? I request Sh. Narenthiran. R and others who are involved in cataloguing such books to shed some light on this.  
  

Are there any other such agencies in India? How do they compare with D K Agencies?
