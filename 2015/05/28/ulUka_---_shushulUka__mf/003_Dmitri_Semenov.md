Thank you N. Siva Senani and Prof.Nagaraj Paturi for your notes.  
  
I was wondering: if by any chance úlūka and śuśulū́ka can be identified as currently present in the environment birds,  
what is different in ways they harass creature at night to give separate types of demons úlūkayātu and śuśulū́kayātu?  
Maybe, úlūka and śuśulū́ka are in some degree on onomatopoeic ?
