It may help you to look at ulookayaatu as a category and s'us'ulookayaatu as its baby form, in stead of taking yaatu as a category and ulookayaatu and s'us'ulookayaatu as its subcategories.



There is a pattern of describing demonical creatures along with their baby forms.



To see the word ulooka as onomatopoeicmay not be wrong. But to look at ulooka and s'us'ulooka as two different mutually independent onomatopoeic words doesn'tseem to benecessary or correct.



Baby demonical creatures are described as equally harassing as the big ones if not more troublesome than them.



Best,



Nagaraj
