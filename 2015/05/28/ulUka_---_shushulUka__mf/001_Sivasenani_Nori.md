Following the is the commentary of Sayanacarya on the particular mantra (along with English translation by yours truly).

  

उलूकाः द्विविधाः बृहदुलूकाः अल्पोलूकाश्चेति। . . . शिशुरल्प उलूकः शुशुलूकः। Ulūkas(owls) are of two types - big Ulūkasandsmall Ulūkas. . . . AŚiśu -small - UlūkaisŚuśulūka.  

  

The change fromŚiśutoŚuśu, and the lack of lengthening of "u" are not explained grammatically, but following the principles of Nirukta, commonality of sounds is resorted to, when a grammatical explanation of the etymology is not available.

  

In one pre-Sayana commentary "Ṛgarthadīpikā"byMādhava son of Veṅkaṭarāya (Edited by Dr. Lakshman Sarup, published by Motilal Banarsidass, Banaras, 1955) the commentator does not differently explain what the various birds are, but simply notes their common quality, namely that all of them roam about in the night harassing creatures:

  

उलूकादयो रात्रिचराः प्राणिनां हिंसकाः . . . .।
