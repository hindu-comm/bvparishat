Swami Vivekananda coined a beautiful term 'scientific superstition' to refer to blind opposition from scientism towards phenomena that science can not explain.



In the preface to his Raja Yoga, it is said,

"

> Since the dawn of history, various extraordinary phenomena have been > recorded as happening amongst human beings. Witnesses are not wanting > in modern times to attest to the fact of such events, even in > societies living under the full blaze of modern science. *The vast > mass of such evidence is unreliable, as coming from ignorant, > superstitious, or fraudulent persons.* *In many instances the so - > called miracles are imitations. But what do they imitate?* **It is not > the sign of a candid and scientific mind to throw overboard anything > without proper investigation. Surface scientists, unable to explain > the various extraordinary mental phenomena, strive to ignore their > very existence.** They are, therefore, more culpable than those who > think that their prayers are answered by a being, or beings, above the > clouds, or than those who believe that their petitions will make such > beings change the course of the universe. The latter have the excuse > of ignorance, or at least of a defective system of education, which > has taught them dependence upon such beings, a dependence which has > become a part of their degenerate nature. The former have no such > excuse.

In a lecture titled "Real nature of Man", included in the book Jnana Yoga he says,



"

I am sorry to say, behind the fine, polished phrases of the moderns is arrant trash. So, we need not throw a thing overboard because it is clothed in mythology, because it does not fit in with the notions of Mr. So-and-so and Mrs. So-and-so of modern times. If people should laugh at religion because most religions declare that men must believe in mythologies taught by such and such a prophet, they ought to laugh more at these moderns. In modern times, if a man quotes a Moses or a Buddha or a Christ, he is laughed at; but let him give the name of a Huxley, a Tyndall, or a Darwin, and it is swallowed without salt. "Huxley has said it", that is enough for many. We are free from superstitions indeed! That was a religious superstition, and **this is a scientific superstition**; only, in and through that superstition came life-giving ideas of spirituality; in and through this **modern superstition** come lust and greed. That superstition was worship of God, and this superstition is worship of filthy lucre, of fame and power. That is the difference.
