Leaving aside the two issues : 1. Names of real world entities being present in the Vedas and otherexpressions of supernatural experience, 2. magical efficacy of such expressions



which are irrelevant in the context of Prof. Korada's words under reference here,



let me focus on the praammaaNya (being source of knowledge) of atIndriya and/or yogipratyaksha:



Prof. Korada's primary focus was on Panini's atIndriya and/or yogipratyaksha. So let us begin with that.



The wonder, the amazement that Panini created in the minds and hearts of modern linguistsis well on record. They used expressions such as Panini antedated modern linguists by millennia.How can such things as 'antedating by millennia'be normal or natural? The only way of explaining that is to use 'well beyond natural', 'far above natural' so 'supernatural'. atIndriya is the word for such a phenomena only.



Prof. Peter Raster of Germany whose name I was quoting in a thread on universals in Panini, while speaking about the idea of composition of Ashtadhyayi as a 'miracle', brought the analogy of Mozart's composition of a huge number of symphonies (around 600 works altogether )within the small age that he lived. He said that Mozart when asked about how could he compose such big complex compositions in a short span of time, he used to say that he 'saw' the whole composition in his mind.Prof. Raster said that Panini must have 'seen' the whole of Ashtaadhyaayi in a flash. Ability to see that way is what is called as 'yogipratyaksha'



It is well documented that the great mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan credited all his mathematical acumen to his family goddess Mahalakshmi of Namakkal.



During our own times, we are able to see persons such as Jagadguru Ramabhadracharyaji Maharaj who drafted his entire PhD work in just a 13 days time. If not atIndriya and yogipratyaksha, what can explain such undisputable facts in front of our eyes?



I was eyewitness to my father Late Sri Paturi Sitaramanjaneyulu garu's 'seeing' books and copying from them, taking dictations from persons eitherlivinghundreds of miles away, or not living any more. ( there were incidents establishing clearly that these 'seen' booksand the matter copied were all true; the dictations were all supported by corroborative evidences. )



Dr. Joshi brought the'seeing' /'hearing'the Vedas into discussion in this context.



VAkyapadIyam has a very clear description of this 'seeing' /'hearing' .

अविभागाद् विवृत्तानाम् अभिख्या स्वप्नवच् छ्रुतौ 1-173

The word स्वप्नवत् is the most significant and interesting part of this line.



Dream was once considered completely meaningless. But during modern period many theories developed establishing the meaningfulness of dreams.



The above mentioned Srinivasa Ramanujan too linked his conjectures to dreams.



Kekule's discovery of Benzene's ring structurethrough a dream of a snake biting its own tail is well documented.



Is not pratyaksha of dream different from the general pratyaksha ?



VakyapadIyam's description of 'seeing/ 'hearing' of the Vedas is that it is dream-like.



What is the difference between general dream and this dream-like state? The difference lies in the personality of the person experiencing the dream or dream-likestate.
