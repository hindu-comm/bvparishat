Alternate thoughts within the bounds of rationality is also science there is no dispute. Believing verbal testimony of people and quoting that as an example that such phenomena does exist is not science unless that can be independently verified and can be experience of all. Yogipratayaksha fall in to the category of pramana which science cannot explain as science we know of today
