**This is the need of the hour than to say "I believe in bhaktas tales and stories about yogipratyaksha"**



Thanks for agreeing with this need of the hour not 'to throw overboard anything without proper investigation' and not to 'ignore their very existence', 'unable to explain the various extraordinary mental phenomena' which is the one I toohave been emphasizing throughout this thread.



Nowhere in the thread did I say, "I believe in bhaktas tales and stories about yogipratyaksha".

Even Srinivasa Ramanujan's biographer from whom I was quoting was not a Bhakta. The book is

If you have an aversion for the word 'yogipratyaksha' , on the basis of the meaningin which you consider it is being used,please let me clarify.

I think it is one of these extraordinary mental phenomena that is being called 'Yogipratyaksha'. That is not my word. That was used in a previous post. I found it used in many older threads on BVP. I didn't think the word was used in the sense of some God giving his appearance in front of a Yogi. I understood that to have been used in the sense of the extraordinary mental phenomena being experienced as vividly as some visual or sound experienced in waking/conscious state.



In the biographies of Swami Vivekannda, it is said, "When the English educated Swami Vivekananda, in search of Truth, asked the humble Bengal villager Sri Ramakrishna, "Have you seen God?" the latter replied, "Yes. I see him just as I see you here, only in a much more intense way." These words impressed Swami Vivekananda."



Swami Vivekananda was wise enough to understand these words in their true sense,in the sense of the extraordinary mental phenomena being experienced as vividly as some visual or sound experienced in waking/conscious state.



That he understands such words in such a sense is evident from the following words from his preface to Rajayoga:



"

For thousands of years such phenomena have been studied, investigated, and generalised, the whole ground of the religious faculties of man has been analysed, and the practical result is the science of Raja-Yoga. Raja-Yoga does not, after the unpardonable manner of some modern scientists, deny the existence of facts which are difficult to explain; on the other hand, it gently yet in no uncertain terms tells the superstitious that miracles, and answers to prayers, and powers of faith, though true as facts, are not rendered comprehensible through the superstitious explanation of attributing them to the agency of a being, or beings, above the clouds. It declares that each man is only a conduit for the infinite ocean of knowledge and power that lies behind mankind. It teaches that desires and wants are in man, that the power of supply is also in man; and that wherever and whenever a desire, a want, a prayer has been fulfilled, it was out of this infinite magazine that the supply came, and not from any supernatural being. The idea of supernatural beings may rouse to a certain extent the power of action in man, but it also brings spiritual decay. It brings dependence; it brings fear; it brings superstition. It degenerates into a horrible belief in the natural weakness of man. There is no supernatural, says the Yogi, but there are in nature gross manifestations and subtle manifestations. The subtle are the causes, the gross the effects. The gross can be easily perceived by the senses; not so the subtle. The practice of Raja - yoga will lead to the acquisition of the more subtle perceptions.
