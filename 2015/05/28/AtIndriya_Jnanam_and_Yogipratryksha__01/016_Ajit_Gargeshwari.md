Whats your great piece of investigation that you have showed apart from testimony of people who believe in extraordinary things Clairvoyance, Levitation Astral Travel yogi pratykasha Siddhis rebirth all fall into the same category which cannot be explained on Science as we know today. Human mind is not completely understood so also the power of myth making. If one cannot demonstrate rationally or accept rationality how can progress be achieved? This like a person trying to prove to the Church the earth is round and revolves round the Sun during middle ages.  
  

To this remark " I think it is one of these extraordinary mental phenomena that is being called 'Yogipratyaksha'. That is not my word. That was used in a previous post. I found it used in many older threads on BVP. I didn't think the word was used in the sense of some God giving his appearance in front of a Yogi. I understood that to have been used in the sense of the extraordinary mental phenomena being experienced as vividly as some visual or sound experienced in waking/conscious state."  

I agree there is no disagreement.
