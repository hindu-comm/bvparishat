Dear Dr Sriram,  

The prajnA is a tool. As Patanjali would describe it is the penultimate culmination  
of the yogic process. It would help you gain insight and and "see more." Krishna  

in the Gita is an example. The physical skills are memory-related and hence need  

be manifested, so the word vibhUti. The question is what causes the manifestation.  

Through some configuration, different parts of the brain do become extra sharp to  
endow people with exceptional skills in numbers, language, music, art, or muscular  
work. We did the first High Resolution Brain Atlas (mouse brain) at Harvard some  
fifteen years ago. The problems that are being addressed in neuroscience are deficits  
and not the exceptions. Lately autism research is looking into the exceptional behavior.  
The process is at sub-neural level and instruments don't exist to measure. We may  
not know in our lifetime. Experiments on humans are hard.  

Best regards,  

BM
