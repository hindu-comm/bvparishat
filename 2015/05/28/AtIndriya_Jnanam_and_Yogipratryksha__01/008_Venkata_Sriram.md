Namaste,

  

That "intellectual capability" is called "ritambharA prajnA" in yogic terminology.

  

"tasmin samAhita chittasya yA prajnA jAyatE tasyA ritambharEti samjnA bhavati" and this something very unique in the sense that the yogi gets "extraordinary intuition" unlike the capability acquired through Agama jnAna and anumAna jnAnaM as described in the sUtra:

  

// shrutAnumAna prajnAbhyAM anya viSayA vishESArthatvAt //

  

As shri.nagaraj garu said, the yogi develops certain extra-ordinary intelligence and intuition. Swami Vivekananda studied and mugged up entire volumes of Encyclopedia Britannica in couple of days; Shri.Kavyakanta Ganapati Muni mastered the sAyaNa bhASya of rg-veda in gokarNa within a span of 14 days; shri.ramabhadracharya completed His Ph.D work in 13 days; shri.aurobindo ghosh used to write volumes of verse of "sAvitri" during meditation et. etc. 

  

All these are the examples of "ritambharA prajnA" only.

  

regs,

sriram
