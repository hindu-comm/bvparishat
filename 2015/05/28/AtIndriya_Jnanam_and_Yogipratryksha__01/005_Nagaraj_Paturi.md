\>\>science agrees to such a view it its not closed to pious admirers or to blessed few but is open to one and all



--- Srinivasa Ramanujan's theorems and conjectures are all open to one and all. It is agreed by one and all that the achievement is so much beyond normal that it needs an explanation. His biographers documented his own words crediting it all to Mahalakshmi ammaavar of Namakkal. You have a choice either to agree with that explanation or not.



All the supernormal achievements of Jagadguru Ramabhadracharyaji Maharaj are available to be seen by one and all.Such supernormal happenings need an explanation. That it is atIndriya and yogipratyaksha is my explanation.



In all science, explanation for a phenomenon isthe theory and the phenomenon so explained is the proof of that theory.



Of course, the example of my father's experiences is a differentstory.



I shall discuss such phenomena on a different occasion.
