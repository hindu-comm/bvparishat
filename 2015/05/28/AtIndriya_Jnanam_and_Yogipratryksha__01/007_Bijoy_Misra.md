Patanjali calls it siddhi and shows how different siddhis can be attained through yoga.  

My thinking has been that the intellectual capability might exponentially increase with  

the stillness of the mind and application of the mental energy to the problem. The mental  

energy in principle can be infinite!  
  

I would agree with Dr Ajit that there should exist physical explanations of exceptional capabilities  

Whether the creativity has any genetic marker could be explored. All boldness in thoughts and  

intellectual convictions might have yet to be discovered genetic origin. The science is in infancy  
in this research mostly dealing currently with the deficits.
