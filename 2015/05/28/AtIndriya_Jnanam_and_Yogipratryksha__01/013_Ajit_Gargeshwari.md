Thanks for selective quoting Swami Vivekananda he has also talked more about science and the need to cleanse religion from superstitious beliefs and never advocated any yogipratyaksha. He was great advocate of rationality.  

  
Quoting from your own extract  
  

"It is not the sign of a candid and scientific mind to throw overboard anything without proper investigation. Surface scientists, unable to explain the various extraordinary mental phenomena, strive to ignore their very existence."  

  
This is the need of the hour than to say "I believe in bhaktas tales and stories about yogipratyaksha**"
