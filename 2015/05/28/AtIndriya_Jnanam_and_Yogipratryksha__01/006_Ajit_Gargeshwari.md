There are several geniuses in the world who continuously contribute towards knowledge of mankind all of them don't claim to pious bhaktas or saints I agree Srinivas Ramnujam was a great Mathematician That is because he was genius not because he was a bhakta and some God gave him a boon. If his biographers were bhaktas they spread their own propaganda I have as you said right to disagree with what if I may call' Hocus Pocus'. I further am of the opinion such irrational thinking will be against spirit of even our ancient thinkers who had a good scientific outlook. Further as you said we can at later point of time if needed can discuss such phenomena
