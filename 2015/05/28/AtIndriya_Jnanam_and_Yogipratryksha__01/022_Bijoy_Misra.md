Manifestation in my view is an unsolved process.  

That is where I have difficulty with "yogaja" as a phrase.  

The mind can comprehend and have much deeper insight.  

But physicality is a different matter, in my opinion.  

The mind perceives. Sensing is an interaction. The  

interaction is physical. Physicality needs boundaries etc.  

We are doing a paper rasasāṅkhya on such topics in  

WSC. I will send you a draft. It is just a view.
