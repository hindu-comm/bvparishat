Prof S. Korada, Saadara PraNaama!



SUBJECT-AtIndriyaJnanam and Yogipratryksha reffered to in your posting.assume that Dras't'aa Rishis who saw (or heard Vedas) were also endowed with AtIndriya Jnanam and Yogipratryksha. In Vedas there is mundane information. Is it necessary to have Yogipratyaksha capacity to refer to countries of the world included in Vedas. Rigveda has name of Devapi from Mahabharata. Atharvdas has mantra on Takman (Maleria). The mantra says let Takman go west to Vaahlikas Gaandaaras and Mahavris'as and east Angadesha. These are the names of the countries. What the objective knowledge only accessible through Yogipratyaksha has to do with countries mantioned in Mahabharata? A girl from Kirata tribe (Himalayas) knew Vanaspati that could cure patient of Maleria. No role of Atharva mantra in this cure . That Maleria was killing people of India from Vedic times to this day. And those sages who saved Vedas word by word and kept Atharveda mantras intact--it did not work. People from a village in India near Himalayan boundary were suffering from Maleria. Briitish governer of that area saw the situation and he drained all accumulating waters of that place. Maleria stopped and people of the village got Mukti from the killing Maleria. So they raised the statue of the governer in the village and talk in very respectful manner about him this. Atharva Veda mantras are available from thousands of years and India had Sages with Yogi Pratyaksha from thousands of years. But they could not stop killing of British soldiers by Maleria. The discovery of drug Quinine stpped it-not Atharva veda mantra. Sobari KaaNva in ancient India was complaing about mice who were eating his oblation dravya of fire ritual. British were distributing cages to Indian population to catch mice. Thousands of mice from Vietnam were killed by French soldiers during their stay in Vietnam. So what is the use of Yogipratyaksha and their compositions. If you say chanting those composition make peoplefree and they get Mukti from this Maayaa, then no further question
