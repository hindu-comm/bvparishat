Regarding Atindriya Jnana and Yogipratyaksha I have something to share in this context.

Here I would like to present what I learnt in my childhood from my Grand Father **Sri Sri Sri Paripurna Prakasananda Bharathi Mahaswami who lived for a span of 105 years**.

I was the founder principal of Vijawada Government Ayurvedic College. He wrote authored more than 250 works on Yoga, Vedanta, Ayurveda and Rasa Tantras including a large medical lexicon popular during his times by name SABDA PRASADAM.

  

He is used to teach me about Atindriya Janana and Yogaja Pratyaksa (Not Yogi Pratyaksha) very often with different examples. According to him ATINDRIYA JNANA is Knowledge acquired through Extra Sensory perception only and not any knowledge that is acquired through any External Means.


Then what could be the internal means of such knowledge? It is nothing but MANAS.

How does it function independently? Yes it is capable of functioning independently.

All other five senses - Skin, Eyes, Ears, Tongue and Nose can perceive anything in this world only when the MANAS helps them in such process of perception. In the absence of Manas the sense cannot perceive or acquire any knowledge. It is in our common experience. But in the absence of the activity of these senses Manas can perceive if it is properly trained to perceive.

In such perception there is direct contact (YOGA - this is not the YOGA of YOGA DARSANA) between the MANAS and the WORLDLY OBJECTS with out any help of the five senses. Since this is possible through the contact of MANAS and OBJECTS it is called YOGAJA PRATYAKSHA.

In the absence of the five senses the MANAS can have the Tactual, Visual, Auditory, Olfactory and Savory Perceptions. This is not due to any MAHIMA or ANY EXTERNAL INTERFERENCE but it is due proper utility of Well Concentrated and Well Trained Mind. 

Just as we do waste our TIME and WATER in the World we do waste the abilities and energies of our MANAS and BUDDHI. Hence we are not capable of utilize their full power. To utilize their full powers we have to first get control over our breathing. Through Pranayama Techniques we can acquire such powers.

This was the gist of the lessons I had in my childhood from my Grand Father who was a great teacher too.

I think this may be useful in the present context.

Regards,

**Dr. Rani Sadasiva Murty**
