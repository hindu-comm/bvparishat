Dear Dr. Joshi,



Prof. Korada's words were:



अदृष्टम् - another प्रमाणम् has to be accepted - it is just like our प्रत्यक्षम् and the ऋषिs , who are above रजस् and तमस् have such अतीन्द्रियज्ञानम् (योगिप्रत्यक्षम्) --



आविर्भूतप्रकाशानाम् अनुपप्लुतचेतसाम् ।

अतीतानागतज्ञानं प्रत्यक्षान्न विशिष्यते॥ 37  

Finally the logician is not a match to ऋषिs , who have योगिदृष्टि --  

अतीन्द्रियान् असंवेद्यान् पश्यन्त्यार्षेण चक्षुषा ।

ये भावान् , वचनं तेषां नानुमानेन बाध्यते ॥ 38



In the above words, there is no mention of or reference to the magical efficacy of Vedamantras for the purpose of curing diseases etc.



Coming to your --



"In Vedas there is mundane information. Is it necessary to have Yogipratyaksha capacity to refer to countries of the world included in Vedas.",



let me tell you that all expressions all over the world believed to be emanating from a supernatural experience (spirit possessions, spirit callings, words of psychics etc.) do contain words referring to real world entities. Is the believed supernatural experience in all these cases required to include references to the real world entities? What else is natural or logical to happen? Should the expressions from the persons believed to be coming from a supernatural experience be totally some unintelligible words without any reference to any real world entities?



In what way is this question related to the magical efficacy of such expressions?



More importantly none of these 'healing' or 'real world entities' are related to the issue of atIndriya and yogipratyaksha aspramANa (source of knowledge)discussed by Prof. Korada.
