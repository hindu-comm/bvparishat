Dear Dr Murty,  

First thing, we have to distinguish between the mind and the senses.
Mind perceives  

and any manifestation has to be done through the senses. The senses bring physicality.  

Mind can "smell" but that's internal, any physical manifestation needs the body.  

There is no reason that mind is restricted to the five senses as we know in this world.  

Mind is much larger and pervades beyond. Any special manifestation here has a decay  

involved, mind has no boundaries, no decay.  
  

As far I can analyze mind can be an augment to sharpen the local senses and the intellect.  

One can gain strength, sharpen intellect or achieve extraordinary powers. But these  

powers do not enable anyone to "produce objects". What science may be able to show  

at a later time how one gets extraordinary powers.  

Best regards,  

BM
