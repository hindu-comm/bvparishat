\>\>Whats your great piece of investigation that you have showed apart from testimony of people who believe in extraordinary things Clairvoyance, Levitation Astral Travel yogi pratykasha Siddhis rebirth all fall into the same category which cannot be explained on Science as we know today.



------ Whats your great piece of investigation?



What is this?



Did I ever at any point say I conducted an investigation or I was quoting investigation?



I was only citing examples of what in Swami Vivekananda's words 'is not to be thrown overboard without proper investigation', in response to a post which was doing exactly this, 'throwing things overboard without proper investigation'. I was appealing not to do that.



I was not the first one or the only one to question the premises of scientism. Swami Vivekananda was one of the early Indians to do that. All over the world there are many.



I understand your anxiety not to encourage superstitious thinking. Please rest assured, I would be the last one to encourage the same. But at the same time it is high time people are exposed to reasonable and rational thoughts alternative to scientism.
