I did not dispute Patanjali or Sutra or Bhashya. I only said Scientific out look is required else it is left to the individuals personal beliefs. Science has not reached there that does not mean such knowledge is impossible it only means that more research is required for rational people to agree. Its best not get into names if I say I can read any 15 volume Encyclopedia with a minute. I visualize it all would any one believe me!! Ok I leave this discussion thread Thank you
