The above examples may be examples of Yogipratryksha. How ever, 

I don't at all subscribe to such views If we bring miracles superstitious beliefs accounts from pious people whom

 we

admire as science its dangerous precedent

. Science may not have explanation to all phenomena that occurs in this universe a little is known a vast remains unknown and proper and through investigation is needed on rational lines. If we cannot find answer based on our current knowledge our current scientific knowledge Scientific knowledge has to improve and science agrees to such a view it its not closed to pious admirers or to blessed few but is open to one and all
