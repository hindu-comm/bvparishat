The question was about the supposedly tatsam word used in Hindi and most of the north Indian languages, while discussing scripts such as devnagari , to refer to those portions of the script symbol which modify the basic script symbol for a consonant to indicate the different vowels or consonants that follow the consonant indicated by the basic script symbol.



For example , considering क to be the basic script symbol,portionsaddedto that basic symbol in symbols such as का,
कि, की, कु , कू etc. are called आ की मात्रा, इ की मात्रा, ई की मात्रा, उ की मात्रा, ऊ की मात्रा respectively.



The thread initiator wants to know how this word entered the languages such as Hindi. 'what is the source language, what is the source text, with what etymological meaning did this word enter contemporary north Indian languages ?' is the question, I think.



Both Monier Williams and Apte give the meaning upper part/upper horizontal line of a Devanagari character to maatraa. This might be the starting for the above meaning in contemporary north Indian languages.



But I think the meaning 'small portion of ' 'part of ' etc. are also at the root of the script related meaning to maatraa in contemporary north Indian languages.
