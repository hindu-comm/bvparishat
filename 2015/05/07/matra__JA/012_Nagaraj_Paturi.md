Sharing my offline reply to Vidwan Shivraj Singh with the list:



There are maatras in Telugu , Kannada and Malayalam scripts. Tamil has a phonemic script. So it has maatras for vowels but not for consonants forming part of clusters.



But the word 'maatra' is not used in none of the Dravidian languages.



For example, in Telugu, 'a' kee maatraa is called talakaTTu which literally means a 'head-wear'. It is a description of how it is written. Itlooks like a check mark and is placed on the top portion of the basic body of the script for a consonant. For example,



క (ka), గ (ga), చ (cha), త (ta), ద (da), ప (pa).



'aa' kee maatraa is called 'deergham'. You know the meaning of 'deergh' It looks like



కా (kaa), గా (gaa), చా (chaa) , తా (taa), దా (daa), పా (paa)



'i' (इ)kee maatraa is called guDi which literally means a temple. (guDi is derived from kuTi =hut. There is a debate over whether thiskuTi is Dravidian or Sanskrit). It looks like



కి (ki), గి (gi) , చి (chi), తి(ti) , ది (di), పి(pi)



Such special names indicating shapes of maatraas are there forupto the maatraa of u, oo,.



From that point onwards, names such as etvam ( e+tv),ē +tv(ētvam), aitvam, (ai+tv) etc. indicating the vowel in the name itself.



The word 'maatraa' is notused.
