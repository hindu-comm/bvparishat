So finally your question was related to orthographical signs representing the vowel added to the consonants and not to the grammatical concept of phonetics.

As far as I know grammar deals with the language and not with the script used for writing. Now it is up to you to refine your question.

Is it related to the specific to Devanagari script or general to other scripts? Many languages do not haven't any script of their own and phonetic scripts are used to record the spoken form of these languages. The phonetic aspect is descriptions are found iशिक्षा texts as explained in the शीक्षाधयाय. regarding the Sanskrit language quotes and they do not explain which type of orthographical sign should be used.
