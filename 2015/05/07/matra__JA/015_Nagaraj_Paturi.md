मात्रा in prosody seems to be from मात्रा = measure.



It is a *unit time of utterance*. Guru is dvimaatraaka means uttering a syllable counted as guru takes two units of time. Laghu is ekamaatraaka means uttering a syllable counted aslaghu takesone unit of time.



This मात्रा is borrowed into the prosodyterminology ofTelugu, Kannada etc. too from Sanskrit. 



Whereas मात्रा as inई की मात्रा, ए की मात्राseems to be from मात्रा = part , being used in this context in the sense of *a part of a script symbol* of a syllable, standing for the vowel *part* of the syllable or the *consonantpart* of a cluster.



This मात्रा isneither found in Sanskrit in the context of बाराखडीnorborrowed into Telugu, Kannada etc in the context of बाराखडी.
