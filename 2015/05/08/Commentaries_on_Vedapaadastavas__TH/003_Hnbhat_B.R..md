It seems to say this much:

Skanda, asked for (to explain), was explaining the meaning of Omkara to Shambhu as सत्यं ज्ञानं ब्रह्माद्वैतम्.

I do not translate the expression as it is popularly known as the definition of ब्रह्म as identified with Omkara too elusive of English translation.

"'सुब्रह्मण्यों सुब्रह्मण्यो'*सुब्रह्मण्योम्*' - is the यजुर्मन्त्रः in तैत्तिरीयारण्यकम् - अरुणप्रपाठकः (not a ऋक् ) I अत्र सन्ति जैमिनिसूत्राणि"

The above is the reply by Prof.Korada on the meaning of the word सुब्रह्मण्य in a topic in bvp.
