Pranams to all,

  

I am looking for traditional and modern commentaries on Vedapaadastavas either in print or in electronic format. All verses in these hymns have the 4th line taken from the Vedas. Some of these Vedic quotes are very difficulty to understand which makes it necessary to have commentaries on them.

  

As all of you know there are Vedapaadastavas of Siva, Vishnu, Tripurasundari and Skanda (Subrahmanya). Also, please let me know if there are Vedapaadastavas of other deities. I already searched the internet for details regarding commentaries and could not find any useful info.  



regards  
shankara
