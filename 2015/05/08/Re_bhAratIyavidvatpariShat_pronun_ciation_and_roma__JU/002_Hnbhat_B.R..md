\> There is good discussion on 'M' kaara and 'H' kaara in words like Brahman etc. Please kindly give me two Sanskrit words (Devanagari and Roman) of each

\(1\) H kaara occurs as Aurasya and two words where it occurs as kanthya.  
  

Paniniya शिक्षा clearly says the हकार in conjunct with the fifth letters of the वर्ग-s is औरस्य and in other cases it is pronounced as कण्ठ्य.

So for your count of two, already three occurrences are already given for औरस्य. All the other cases where ह् occurs in words isolated or in conjunct other than those mentioned (if any) is considered as कण्ठ्य.

The other words जिह्म, ब्राह्मी, ब्राह्मणः etc. for औरस्य. The declensions of the word अहन् like अह्ना, अह्नः, अह्नि and the compound form in the final position as prescribed by the rule अह्नो√ह्न एतेभ्यः are the further examples.

I need not give other examples of कण्ठय हकार dictionaries as you can find so many words in the uer the letter ह.  

\> Second question--It was suggested that one may write Sanskrit word Gangaa by using the nasal (as we write using diacritical mark in Roman) instead a dot (Anuswaara) on the top line of the word.

I think Dr. Dhaval has replied your question precisely. In all the other cases than those listed, the अनुस्वार will remain as it is including those you have asked. This is according to the grammatical analysis than the rules of pronunciation being discussed.
