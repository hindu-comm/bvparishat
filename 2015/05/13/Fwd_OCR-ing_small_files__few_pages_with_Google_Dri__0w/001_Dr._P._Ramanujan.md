I had wanted to try on different Kannada, Tamil, Telugu, grantha and manipravala inputs and test efficacy.  



Sri NS Venkatesh did the testing and the following are his observations:  



The OCR is good-to-very-good for even average scans; but has some  
restrictions  
  
 - works with jpeg images (not tifs)  
 - small (\<= 10 pages) pdf files  
 - excellent recognition for english but \*no \*proviso for diacritics  
 - poor-average recognition for sanskrit; not close to Oliver's OCR  
 - average for hindi  
 - no proviso for grantha
