After reading the posts repeatedly two or three points become apparent or vaguely suggested.

1\. The Hindu marriage Act was enforced by Jawaharlal Nehru in following the western law codes than Indian Law codes स्मृति texts.

2\. The above allegation presupposes it was Nehru who enforced western culture of divorce into Hindu Law and Law need not take into consideration of the current society or the future needs of the society.

3\. For the above reasons, a revision/restoration/revival of our Hindu Act of Marriage is felt as the need of the current social condition.

4, This necessitates the restoration of the ancient rules for the present Claude's of the divorce which motivated the question. I mean all the other circumstances/or deviations to be deleted from the conditions which are envisaged by the law makers as the are against the Hindu codes of law धर्मशास्त्र.:

धर्मे च*अर्थे*च कामे च*नातिचरामि नातिचरामि नातिचरामि*!
