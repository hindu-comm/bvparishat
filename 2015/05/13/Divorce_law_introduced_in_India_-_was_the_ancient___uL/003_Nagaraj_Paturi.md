Though provisions for divorce in Shastras is so well known, the impression that there were no such provisions is also widely prevalent in the literature of modern period on the history of Indian divorce law.Impression is created in such literature that the 1954/1955 was a revolutionary move introducing divorce for the first time. Probably as it usually happens in the folklore about such issues, the name of Jawaharlal Nehru is brought into the story.



The interesting information I have is from some Telugu literary works of1920-1930 where women authors with a mix ofreformative and traditional tendencies, whilestrongly supporting the law against child marriage, argued vociferously against introducing a law permitting divorce in Hindu families. I have been trying to figure out which legislative news or developments of 1920s were they reacting to. But this is a documentation of the fact that traditional sections of the educated Indians of those times were opposing the proposal on the basis of the fear that this could lead tointensificationand hastening of breaking up of families and reduction of perseverance in the partners ofa marital relationship. This is probably the period when the stories of divorce being against shastras began to get floated.
