The Sage Parahsara composed the Parashara Smriti specifically for the Kali yuga and that too at the request of his son Vedavyasa. Vedavyasa said that the other Smritis do not meet the requirement of the changing times (for the Kali yuga). Pt. Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar is said to have fought the Sati pratha (widow-burning) on the strength of the Parashara Smriti. Kaultilya's Arthashastra, being a Kali yuga text had
necessarily to toe the line of Parashara smriti.  
  

As regards Draupadi's marriage, though Arjuna won her hand he could not have married her alone, mainly because an younger brother should not marry before the marriage of the elder brother. At this time I do not recall the provisions of the Shastra and I hope some scholars of the forum may have ready information on that.
