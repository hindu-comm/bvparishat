The custodians say, the marriage is irreversible. They approach the law for a solution.Courts after due discussion,grant divorce.

6\. A and B are married according to Vedic sacraments. A or B alone finds reasons for why their marriage can not continue. A or B approaches S'aastra custodians for a solution. The custodians say, the marriage is irreversible . A or Bapproaches the law for a solution.The one who did not apply for a divorce does not attend the court proceedings. An ex-parte order is issued granting divorce. Does or can the one who did not apply for a divorce, force the other person to live with him or her as married?



7\. Trouble comes only when issues such as maintenance or property inheritance are involved. If the person who is ordered to paymaintenance to his /her 'ex-spouse' (as per law )refuses to comply with the court order, then the courtcan take action against such person for contempt of court. The person can not take shelter under irreversibility of marriage quoting s'aastras or the words of the custodians of s'aastras.



Thus, as long as the decisions of continuance or discontinuance of marriage are taken by the parties involved without any violation of legal rights of a person or general universal human rights, law does not interfere with the actions of the parties involved.
