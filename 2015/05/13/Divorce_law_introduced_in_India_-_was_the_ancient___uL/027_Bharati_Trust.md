It is not fully correct to say that Nehru made divorce legal. Arthasastra of Koutilya allows divorce in certain types of marriages. the term for Divorce is Moksha.Even i was under the impression that in ancient India all marriages were inviolable.

I was pleasantly surprised to get this info. in Arthasastra.kautilya was perhaps the most practical administrator and lawgiver.

Dear Vidvaj-janas,

  
  
Divorce was nonexistent in Hindu culture until 1955 when Jawaharlal  
Nehru, Prime Minister of India, legalized it, thus shaking countless  
centuries of marital stability. Did he revoke the ancient statutes of  
Manu in doing so?  
  

Thankyou,
