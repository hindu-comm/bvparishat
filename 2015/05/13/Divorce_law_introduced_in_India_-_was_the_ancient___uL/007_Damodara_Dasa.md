Hare Krishna.  
Agreed about this verse.  
  
But the divorce law introduced in 1955 doesn't mention the divorce  
only based on the allowances given in the Parasara Smrti correct?  
Today it is a fact that if the husband and wife do not like to live  
together at any point in time, then they can take divorce (although  
court may try to convince them not to do so) - Hindu Marriage Act 1955  
(1976) 13-B. The conditions mentioned in Parasara Smrti need not be  
fulfilled.  
  
In the society governed by Manu Smrti, or Parasara Smrti, generally  
divorce was not known as it is now - i.e. the divorce based on mutual  
dislike or conflict. As it was compulsory for husband and wife to live  
together lifelong, there naturally was a need for some allowances in  
case the above mentioned (in parasara smrti) cases occur (which in  
inevitable in any society). In such cases, rsis (or authorities) were  
consulted and they decided case to case. Example of Draupadi can be  
given where in general a woman is not allowed to have more than one  
husband but in her case she was allowed to have five husbands (after  
consultation from Vyasadeva).  
  
So my point is that divorce law was introduced in India (that is a  
fact - correct me if I am mistaken), so that means something that  
previously didn't exist (before its introduction) was to be  
established by introduction of this law. So what was that and what  
reasons were given (including sastric ones) in support of this, as  
society in general didn't support this whatever may be the reason.  
  
Thankyou,  
Damodara Das
