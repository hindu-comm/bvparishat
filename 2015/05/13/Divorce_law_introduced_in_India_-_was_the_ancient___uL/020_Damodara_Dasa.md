Hare Krishna.  
  
From Ashok Aklujkar:  

\>\> As far as I recall, Dharma-śāstra and law experts like P.V. Kane were involved or consulted in the drafting of the Hindu Code bill.  
  

From: Nagaraja Paturi:  
\>\> P V Kane was the Chairman of the Joint Select Committee on the Hindu Code Bill as per a news item dated 27 November, 1954 reported under 'This Day That Age' of the Hindu, dated 27, November, 2004 found at  
http:// [www.thehindu.com/2004/11/27/stories/2004112700720900.htm](http://www.thehindu.com/2004/11/27/stories/2004112700720900.htm)  
  

Yes, I am looking for answer in similar lines - i.e. how was the  
passed marriage act (1955) supported for its stance in opposotion to  
the then well-known belief that divorce is against dharma or Manu  
smrti (it is another discussion that this belief is correct or not).  
So in answer here it is pointed out that PV Kane was involved in to  
it. Something more detailed in this line will be very helpful - means  
some details of the discussions and arguments presented both in  
support and against this bill.  
  
For information of all the members, although I have asked this and a  
few more questions recently, I have to go to some remote place for  
some urgent work due to which I won't be able to access internet for  
next 5 days but these discussions can go on and I'll join after 5  
days. I thank all the members of this group for helping by sharing  
their knowledge.  
  
Thankyou,  
Damodara Das
