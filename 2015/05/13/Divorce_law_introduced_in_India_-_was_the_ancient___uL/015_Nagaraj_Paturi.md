Vidwan Rakesh Das was on dot covering the focus of Vidwan Damodar Das only.



He very clearly statedthat



"Section 13 of this particularact deals with Divorce. There the causes mentioned for seeking divorce are almost same **as mentioned by Kautilya or Parasara etc**.



The section 13-b mentions a separate concept of mutual divorce. There also both the husband and wife will have to submit a petition that they have been staying separately for at least a year and they are not ready to stay with each other. Here also it is kamachara. I don't know if this concept is there in our Smritis. But this kind of occurrence **may be found in the Puranas** where the couple separate from each other by their own will and for that the order of the court was not necessary."

  

What he did not do is to show in detail, which sub-clause of section 13 is in accordance with which provision in the shastras. That is a detailed big study to be taken up as a separate project.

  

There are two aspects of the post by Vidwan Damodar Das : 1. Concern about the increasing tendencies for divorce. As Prof. Dipak Bhattacharya has already made it clear, this is really a matter of great concern not only in India but all over the world. 'Saving family' is one of the regular election promises by presidential candidates in US elections.

  

                                   
                   2. Role of a 'loose' divorce law in this deplorable development. Vidwan Damodar Das has a feeling that the present law is 'loose' and that is because the shastras are not followed in framing the law. But let us all note that thedivorce law section of Hindu Marriage Act is not as loose as it is being felt. I am sharing here a law commission report on the irretrievable breakdown as a basis of divorce to exemplify the amount of intense work and thought that goes into making these laws.

  

                                   
                    The increasing divorces are not because of law but in spite of it.

  

 As a point of general observation, let us note that laws have little control over matters of culture.

  

                                   
  At the same time, let us also note that the false-belief that Shastras do not provide for dovorce, it is not traditional to divorce has lead to a huge stress and fatal developments in traditional families.
