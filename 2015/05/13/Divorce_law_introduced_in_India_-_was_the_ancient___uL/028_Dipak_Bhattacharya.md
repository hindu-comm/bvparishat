Some relevant information on the practice followed in orthodox circles is given here.

In the orthodox Pandit circles of Benaras नष्टे मृते प्रव्रजिते क्लीबे च पतिते पतौ is interpreted as पतिते ऽपतौwith अपति meaning पतिसदृशे that is after वाग्दान but before marriage. Some modern pandits like Pramathanātha Tarkabhūṣaṇa apart from Aryasamaji interpreters of Śāstra did not accept this interpretation. Such Pandits were not considered as belonging to their circle by orthodox pandits. The verse cited occurring in Kauṭilya’s Arthaśāstra is ignored by such orthodox pandits I met.

Even then divorce as such is an avoided term. The stance is that such marriages are असिद्ध।

I will like to know if any such development took place in Tirupati. In Calcutta, orthodox pandits were on the backfoot because of the vigour of the Brahmo movement and Vidyasagar’s influence. An extensive literature has grown on these Calcutta developments. About Benaras I know from personal experience. But I shall like to be enlightened about the position of the Prarthana Samaj of Sir R.G.Bhandarkar. Among his twentieth century followers there are eminent personalities who promoted widow marriage.
