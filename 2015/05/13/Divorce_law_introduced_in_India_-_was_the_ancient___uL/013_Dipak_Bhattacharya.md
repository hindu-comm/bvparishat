I do not think that anybody, here or elsewhere, disputes that living separately by husband and wife is a tragic outcome in life. The ancient law saw reasons that had no cure without divorce. But even the ancient background of divorce whether on demand from the wife or from the husband was not without an element of tragedy. The modern law does not necessarily compel finding the reason that may be even psychological and temperamental. But nobody hails this as a welcome turn of events. I myself regard this as one of the most tragic outcomes like untimely death.

I think this is the kernel of the matter – a bitter, sometimes devastating sometimes better than the worst, outcome of life. Whether the traditional outlook has been maintained or not is not the question for society. Even in the West, the introduction of divorce, first among Protestants, lately even among Roman Catholics and now in many other societies has not been smooth. Till date there are strong opponents of the practice.
