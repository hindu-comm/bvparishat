\>\> So, the point is what new is introduced in the law of 1955?  

The section 13-B seems to be a new introduction. This very strongly  
affects the marriage stability especially when in today's youth  
college culture changing partners is considered something very normal.  
  
Also regarding general social ethos in traditional Indian culture, we  
need to consult learned people from different well-known traditions  
like mAdhvas, Sri Vaisnavas, Smartas, Saivas, etc. who themselves  
learned from their tradition. Just reading law codes may not suffice  
as law may mention many things that were not propagated among people  
in general but were there in code books so as to guide the kings and  
brahmanas to judge the cases. we may consider that right to  
information act was not there before and thus all the codes of law  
were not known by people in general.  
Many of these scholars opine that general disposition was that there  
was no option of getting separated once married and even the thought  
of it was considered sinful. Now the smrtis are mainly studied by  
brahmanas and ksatriyas not by people in general. So there are  
provisions for getting separated on certain conditions, but these  
conditions were not made known to people in general but they were  
guided to do so, in case such a condition arises, by the law  
maintainers (brahmanas and ksatriyas).  
  
Dr. Subrahmanyam Korada may be able to throw some light on this as he  
has some touch with that culture. Also other such members of the  
group, whom I may not know, may throw some light.  
  
My question was that in support to the divorce section (no.13)  
introduced in Hindu Marriage Act 1955, did Nehru revoke the then ethos  
of its being against scriptures? Because such oppositions might have  
been raised, especially in the hindu society of those times (I think  
one thing we all can agree is that in Indian society, even 100 years  
back, divorce was an unheard affair and even if heard was considered  
something very sinful).  
  
Sorry for being complicated in framing my question.  
  
Thankyou,
