Respected All,  
  
In so far as I have studied this, Hindu Code Bill Sameeksha (Telugu translation of it is available here: <https://archive.org/details/hinducodebillsam020125mbp>) of Swami Karpatri (Swami Hariharananda Saraswathi) is probably the most comprehensive one. Akhil Bharatiya Dharma Sangh in Varanasi may have copies of the Hindi version.  
  
How far can the modern notion of 'divorce' be equated with the Kautilya's "त्याज्य" is a question to be addressed. If one goes a step further, it is equally the case to distinguish the  
sense of what is 'law' in modern times as opposed to the sense of 'Dharma'.  
  
Sincerely,  
Pranav  
  
(Student of Dharmasastra-s and Constitution of India)
