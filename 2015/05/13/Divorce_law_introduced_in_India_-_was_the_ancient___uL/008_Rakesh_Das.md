The point raised by Sri Damodar Das is not clear. There may be some mistake of understanding. Actually, no Divorce law was introduced to India in 1955 or so on. The law which was introduced is calledTHE HINDU MARRIAGE ACT, 1955. Section 13 of this particularact deals with Divorce. There the causes mentioned for seeking divorce are almost same as mentioned by Kautilya or Parasara etc. The section 13-b mentions a separate concept of mutual divorce. There also both the husband and wife will have to submit a petition that they have been staying separately for at least a year and they are not ready to stay with each other. Here also it is kamachara. I don't know if this concept is there in our Smritis. But this kind of occurrence may be found in the Puranas where the couple separate from each other by their own will and for that the order of the court was not necessary.

  

So, the point is what new is introduced in the law of 1955?
