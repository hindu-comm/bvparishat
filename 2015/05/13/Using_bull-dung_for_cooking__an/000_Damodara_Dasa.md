Hare Krishna.  
  
Dear Vidvaj-janas,  
  
It is well known that cooking on cow-dung is considered very pure in  
Indian culture and many literatures like puranas, etc. mention this  
fact. Is there a mention about using bull-dung for cooking or more  
clearly prohibiting bull-dung for cooking?  
  
I want the references from puranas, etc. or from traditions of  
brahmanas of India. what used to be practice among Indian brahmanas -  
did they use bull-dung also for cooking?  
  
Thankyou,  
Damodara Das
