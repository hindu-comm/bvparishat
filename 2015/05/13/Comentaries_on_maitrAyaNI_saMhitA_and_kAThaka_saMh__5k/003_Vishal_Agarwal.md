There are no commentaries of Maitrayani Samhita in these two languages. Portions in English translation exist in other works (e.g. study of Agnihotra etc.). See the attached file containing the portion translated by Bodewitz. Dr T N Dharmdhikari was working on a translation of this scripture. I am not sure how far that has reached, but nothing exists in print. There are of course book length studies on this Samhita, like by Dr Vedakumari, by Dr Dharmadhikari and so on. The Maitrayani Aranyaka (virtually same as the Maitrayani Upanishad in 7 Prapathakas) is available in several English and Hindi translations.

  

For the Kathaka Samhita, Dr P D Navathe has translated several sections
(along with corresponding portions of the Kapishthala Samhita) into English, and the same have been published from Pune (CASS Studies). Some portions of Katha Brahmana (extant fragments) available in translation; and the Pravargya section of Katha Aranyaka by Bhaglata Pataskar in English translation are also available.
