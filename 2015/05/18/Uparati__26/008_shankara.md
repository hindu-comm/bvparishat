Sir,

  

Thank you very much for the explanation. It is helpful.

  

Though I am familiar with the word Uparati in the sense of stopping, cessation, etc, I was wondering whether it was the upasarga or the dhatu that contributed to the meaning. I saw later that Apte's dictionary provides alternate meanings of the verb 'ramu' as 'to take rest', 'to remain quiet'. etc.  



regards  
shankara
