Pranams,

  

Meaning of Uparati given in dictionaries is 'cessation of activity, being inactive, stop doing something, etc.'  

In normal course, Upa means near, together, down, etc'.  

  

I request scholars to explain how this negative meaning is derived from 'Upa' and 'rati'.



regards  
shankara
