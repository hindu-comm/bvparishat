The word that is used on such an occasion is “upararAma”. It means the opponent “rested, devoid of arguments”. In other words, he reached ‘uparama’, the state of rest.The words ‘uparama’ (the noun form describing the action implied in the verb ‘upararAma’) and ‘uparati’ are both the same. In fact ‘yama’ and ‘yati’ both connote the state of action less rest. ‘uparati’ is of the same kind. He who has reached ‘uparati’ is said to be an ‘uparata’.  
  

This is the dictionary  
उपरति **uparati** f. desisting from sensual enjoyment or any worldly action उपरति **uparati** f. quietism उपरति **uparati** f. cessation उपरति **uparati** f. death उपरति **uparati** m. ceasing उपरति **uparati** m. stopping
