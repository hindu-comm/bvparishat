In my understanding, Marathi uparati means ‘remorse, repentance’, and I see the following semantic development as quite plausible: ‘rejoice nearby’ —> ‘stop just before the end / not go the very last stage’ —> discontinue the activity, desist’ —> realise the futility or wrongness of what one is/was doing’ —> ‘remorse, repentance.’  
  
Here, the second and the third stages are not different from what we see in Sanskrit and the related languages. The fourth stage could be viewed as merely a different way of understanding ‘understanding,’ which is Prof. Deshpande’s final stage.
