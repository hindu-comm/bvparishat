Salutations to the one who served the scholarly community in an exemplary fashion for more than a decade making various ebooks available. Shankara is indeed a meaningful name in this case because शम् has indeed been effected by Sri Shankara.

  

Even though your specific query has been answered by yourself, allow me to present my understanding of upasargas and their meaning, as this topic seems to give rise to similar doubts in many people (it did baffle me for long).

  

Upasargas are 22 in the tradition of Grammar and they are "dyotakas", i.e. they themselves do not add any meaning, but only reveal, or throw light on, the meaning inherent in the dhatu. Dhatus themselves have many meanings (अनेकार्थत्वं धातूनाम्), of which only the most popular are listed by Acarya Bhima in the meanings that we read in Dhatupatha. This explains why a dhatu has two opposing meanings - गच्छति, आगच्छति ; ददाति (gives), आददाति (brings); स्थानम् (place), प्रस्थानम् (journey) and so on. This is encountered very frequently in Nyasa (यमो गन्धने ॥1.2.15॥, मृषस्तितिक्षायाम् ॥1.2.20॥, प्रकाशनस्थेयाख्ययोश्च॥1.3.23॥, प्रभवति ॥4.3.83॥, समांसमां विजायते ॥5.2.12॥ etc.) In fact in 1.3.23 and 4.3.83, we have the situation where प्रतिष्ठे and प्रभवति mean प्रकाशते and while trying to explain this, Nyaasakaara resorts to अनेकार्थ्वत्वम् of Dhatus.

  

In the tradition of Nirukta, upasargas are 20 (निर् and निस् are considered as one; as are दुर् and दुस्). They are treated as independently meaningful. There, उप is defined as उप इति उपजनम्। (1.3) उपजनम् means "adding to", "in addition" etc. Nirukta follows Vyakaranam to the extent possible, when it is not, other means are resorted to, but one cannot say that an etymology is not possible \[as Grammarians do, through the device of nipatana, which is to say that a given word cannot be split as prakriti and pratyaya and is received in its finished form\]:

  

अथ निर्वचनम्। तद्येषु पदेषु स्वरसंस्कारौ समर्थौ प्रादेशिकेन विकारेणान्वितौ स्यातां तथा तानि निर्ब्रूयात्। अथानन्वितेऽर्थेऽप्रादेशिके विकारेऽर्थनित्यः परीक्षेत। केनचिद्वृत्तिसामान्येन। अविद्यमाने सामान्येऽप्यक्षरवर्णसामान्यान्निर्ब्रूयात्। न त्वेव न निर्ब्रूयात्।

  

In fact, Yaskacarya does not stop there. He goes on to say that vrittis (complex formations) are subject to many doubts and therefore one need not respect "samskaara" i.e. the process ordained by Vyakarana \[in such cases\]: "न संस्कारमाद्रियेत। विशयव्तयो हि वृत्तयो भवन्ति।"

  

So, following Nirukta one can be far more adventurous in explaining the etymologies.

  

However, both Sastras - in fact all Sastras - respect "lokavyavaharaa". If people - or more precisely SishTas - use a word or a phrase in a certain sense, that is that. To use one nyaya from Mimamsa, योगात् रूढिर्बलीयसी - The conventional meaning is more powerful than the etymological. Given a usage, Sastra has to then explain why it. Vyakaranam has different techniques (nipaatas, prishodaraadi gaNam etc.) and Nirukta has different techniques. While each may be resorted to consistently, we should not mix these techniques in one derivation - that would lead to confusion.
