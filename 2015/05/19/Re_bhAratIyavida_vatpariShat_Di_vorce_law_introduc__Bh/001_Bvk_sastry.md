Namaste

  

I think some of the following points, subtle in nature but contemporarily relevant need to be clearly understood. It is also a reflection on ' what and how of living according to Dharma-Shaastra. In short the operative domains of Dharma- Shaastra and Government of a nation in making laws on religion- customs- inheritance- sensitive human relations are of independent domain and operation. Legal right may not always be a Dharmic right for enforceability or ground for civil- criminal cases. If one reads MM PV Kane on the topic of Hindu Marriage Law and divorce related all these points become clear. Politicalization of sensitive Dharma Shaastra issues is a different agenda altogether needing a different rope and stick to handle.

  

Would Sanatanis want government to be mediator - overruler - interpreter of veda- dharma- yoga Shaastra ? It is a different question for a new thread.

  

1\. Marriage as a Samskara is different from a social legal contract. This is known from ancient times in the clarity of the words: patnee (dharma-patnee- bhoga kaantaa ; itaraa - veshyaa). Arthashaastra is on social governance and enforcement of Vedic Dharma, placed under authority of King.

Dharma shaastra is personal embrace and practice of sanatana dharma under self- acceptance conditions, to be guided by a Guru.

  

Guru and Raja have different roles, responsibilities and authorities to operate.

  

Pleasure of partnership ( bhoga sukha) and ritual status of patnee bestowed by Samskara come with different rights and obligations.
Similarly children from wives of different relational status have different legal and dharmic rights.

Dharmashaastra gies to the extent of identifying. Children of Dharmic status and children of pleasure (- dharma santaana versus kaama santaana). Government does not go to recognize such finer distinctions within the children of same father.

  

Dharma santaana and vivaha is controlled by laws of dharma shaastra and are varna- ashrama specific; and specific to the type of marriage (- of eight types) also.

The other is individual contract.

  

Modern secular state (- like India ) has deviated from varna-ashrama identity for its citizens in the definition of ' citizen of india'. Now is not the time to ask for a roll back on history and seek ' varna-ashrama identity restoration for citizens of india'!

More over by the government adoption of Caste based Census identity , indian government has created its own complexities in national identity definition.

  

Dharmashastras have not defined any Samskara ( especially vivaha) by Jaati- mata;; caste creed basis . What has been a part of heritage as jaati- kula customs are diluted derivatives. Dharmashaastra works can not be held as fig leaf cover or punch bags to argue for and against these cases.

  

Lastly the jaati mata kula aachara parts of Samskaara are so much distorted from the core thought and prescribed formats that were seen in pre independence India to post independence India and globalized india.
Such being the case, there is a critical need for traditional Dharma shaastra teams to awake-arise and respond upgrades of Dharma Shaastra beyond a backward compatibility and backbending exercise of selective quotes from texts. The difficulty is in finding an internal consistency between talk in text to illustrations around.

  

Dr. Ramanujam, Korada and others have pointed out the subtleties and challenges in clearly grasping the intent of tradition.
