Namatse,  
  

Thank you for your excellent analysis. However I have one doubt regarding patita. I read years ago that a woman never becomes apavitra, whatever she could have done herself or whatever could have been done to her, except that she may at most be **somewha**t isolated for a month or in rare cases for a year. Would you like to touch upon this aspect also ?  
  

Regards,
