Annulment (dissolution) of a marriage or release from a contracted marriage is mentioned by Kautilya in his Arthashastra (Book III). Hence we can not say that concept of 'divorce' did not exist. However among the eight types of marriages only the last four could be annulled by mutual consent. The first four types of "dharma vivaaha" could not be dissolved. The word used by Kautilya for indicating dissolution of a marriage is mokSaH. Under the Civil law of his times Kautilya discusses several intricate issues regarding alimony, maintenance, cruelty to the spouse etc.
