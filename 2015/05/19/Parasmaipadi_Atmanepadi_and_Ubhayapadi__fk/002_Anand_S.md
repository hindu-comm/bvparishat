Thank you sir.

But I heard one of the scholars saying the division is based on the usage that existed in the Vedic age. i.e. for instance in case of 'pac' dhatu

which is ubhayapadi, when a yajna is performed and in that yajna, paaka kriya is done by the priest for the yajna which is for the yajamana so there parasmapadi is used meanwhile

when the priest in his home does personal homa there the paaka is done for his own karma there atmanepadi is used.

This looks logical as well.
