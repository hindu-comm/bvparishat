All divisions including that of "parasmaipadi, aatmanepadi and ubhayapadi" are based on the usage. Always lakshaNa comes from lakshya.



Divisions in language exist for the reasons of convention in the language.



lAkshaNikas only recognize them, organize them andcodify them.



In the pANinIya tradition, this (recognizing, organizing andcodifying)is done by prakriyAbhAga. In this tradition, Arthika bhAga provides the 'theory' by explaining the 'reason' that lies in the convention of the speakers.



vAkyapadIya is the fountain head of the available Arthika granthas.



The chapter called upagrahasamuddEs'a (of padakAnDa of vAkyapadIya)provides the theory for the AtmanEpadi parasmaipadi division followed by the Sanskrit speakers.



It is a small chapter. So you may be able to follow the whole explanation.
