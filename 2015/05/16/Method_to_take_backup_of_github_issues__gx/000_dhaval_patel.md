Respected scholars,  

Nowadays many NLP scholars are working on Github.  

Most of the discussion are stored in github issues.  

I have written a small CLI utility in shell script which may be of interest to the scholars.  

It takes a backup of github issues and renders an HTML for local viewing with the same experience as github (because I used the same CSS:))  
<https://github.com/drdhaval2785/github_issue_backup> is the code  
<http://drdhaval2785.github.io/github_issue_backup/sanskrit-lexicon/CORRECTIONS/2.txt> is the text output  
<http://drdhaval2785.github.io/github_issue_backup/sanskrit-lexicon/CORRECTIONS/html/2.html> is the HTML output.  
  

Any bug reporting is welcome at <https://github.com/drdhaval2785/github_issue_backup/issues>
