I haven't seen the Nirnaya Sagar Press Edition Ajit Ji. Moreover I don't think that Chowkamba reprinted it. Because Nirnaya Sagar's publications are very neat in appearance and the types used in those days also are very attractive.

But chowkhamba's edition consists of good number of stotras in its both the volumes but in certain pages the slokas are very congested. Even the punctuation marks are not properly followed. Only for the sake of some rarest Stotras we can rely upon these two volumes.

  

There is another set of Three volumes in Telugu script published by Vavilla Press where the first volume deals with Vishnu Stotras (including the stotras of Vishnu Parivara), the second volume deals with Devi Stotras (including all the stotras of Devi Parivara) and the third volume deals with Siva Stotrani (including all the stotras of Siva Parivara). The print is very neat, The contents are free from mistakes and the number of stotras presented in these three volumes are more than in any other stotra collection of this kind. The name of this Set also is BRHAT STOTRA RATNAKARA only.
