I am only evaluating your statements and your thought process. I am not passing any observation or judgement on you. If you do not want your statements or thought process to be subjected to evaluation, I am happy not to.

There is a difference. In your post on Aug 15, you said that A ⇒ B can be inferred from F3 by arthapatti. Inferences need proof. Your proof derived B ⇒ A from F3 by arthapatti. I stated they are not the same.

  

In my post, I did not infer either A ⇒ B or A ⇏ B. I stated that the assumption A ⇒ B is not necessary for F3, and the assumption A ⇏ B does not contradict F3. Assumptions do not need proof. In fact, there is a method called *reductio ad absurdum*which is used to prove a statement by assuming its opposite and then deriving a statement which is known to be false.

I am happy to continue the thread as long as the admins are fine with it. If they are not, I would rather stop the discussion than have a private discussion.

No, please do not attempt a proof again. I was exploring your thought process, and I do not wish to explore it any further.

You can read about the fallacy known as *converse error*. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affirming_the_consequent) is a good starting point.  

  

Thanks, Nityanand
