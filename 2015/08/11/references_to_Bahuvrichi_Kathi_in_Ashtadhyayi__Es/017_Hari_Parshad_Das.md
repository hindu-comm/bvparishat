**Your original statement:** I think Hari Parshad Das is referring to this sentence in the NSM: ननु मङ्गलं न विघ्नध्वंसं प्रति न वा समाप्तिं प्रति कारणं विनापि मङ्गलं नास्तिकादीनां ग्रन्थेषु निर्विघ्नपरिस्माप्तिदर्शनादिति चेन्न। If no, Das may please let us know which sentence of the NSM he had in mind.  
  

**You have attributed a sentence to my reasoning by the use of your intellect and then you write many details based on that assumption without even me having specified which section i am speaking about and what i am trying to say.**

**Before we get into the details, can you please go through the section on Mangalacharan given in NSM, which shows that even a nāstika has performed maṅgala to destroy his obstacles, before something else gets attributed on me by you and then again try to interpret my words? Also, you made the following statement:  
  
** It is possible that some Āstikas remember, *some Āstikas do not remember*.  
  
**Can you please demonstrate the validity of this possibility using NSM or any other bona-fide nyāya/mīmāṁsā grantha, especially the underlined part? I would like to know whether there is a nyāya/mīmāṁsā grantha says that there can exist a theistic composer who may not even be willing to mentally recall his deity before beginning a composition.
