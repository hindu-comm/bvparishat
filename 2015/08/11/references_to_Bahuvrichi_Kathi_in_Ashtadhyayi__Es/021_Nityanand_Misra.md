Thanks for your response. This is what you wrote on August 15:

*maṅgalācaraṇa is mandatory for āstika granthas as far as I have studied. It is given in the nyāya-siddhānta-muktāvalī that granthas without maṅgalācaraṇa belong to the nāstikas.*

Unquote

  

Let's break it down into two parts for ease of reference

  

Claim 1 (HPD): maṅgalācaraṇa is mandatory for āstika granthas as far as I have studied.  

Claim 2 (HPD): It is given in the nyāya-siddhānta-muktāvalī that granthas without maṅgalācaraṇa belong to the nāstikas.

Thanks for the reference. The copy-pasted section does not confirm Claim 1 or Claim 2.

Thanks again for reference, but this copy-pasted section also does not confirm Claim 2. As far as Claim 1 goes, the conditioning in absent in Chaudhari's conclusion (see below).

Chaudhari's conclusion in the commentary is this (let's call it a claim to simplify referencing, and let's also see Claim 1 once again):  

  

Claim 3 (SC): The conclusion is that mangalagana is necessary for unobstructed completion of the grantha.

Claim 1 (HPD): maṅgalācaraṇa is mandatory for āstika granthas as far as I have studied.  

  

Claim 1 specifically talks about āstika works, and claim 3 is talks about general works. Claim 3 is an unqualified statement (no mention about the type of work) while Claim 1 is a qualified statement. Now let's see two statements:

Researcher 1: Yoga is good for the body.  

Researcher 2: Yoga is good for the body for Hindus, and researcher 1's conclusion too is that Yoga is good for the body.

  

Is not the position of Researcher 2 misleading? Agreed that the first part of his statement is factually correct, but if he cites conclusion of researcher 1 in support, is it fair?

Thanks for copy-pasting the commentary, but can you please give me the name of the commentary? Publication, author, year, etc.

So the short answer is this was your own presumption. However, on August 16 you said you arrived at the below claim by arthāpatti from a statement in a commentary on the NSM.

  

Claim 4 (HPD): āstikāstu īśvaram anyāṁ veṣṭadevatām avaśyamevāṅgīkurvanto granthārambhe (āstikās necessarily remember īśvara or an iṣṭadevatā at the beginning of the grantha).

  

Today (August 17), you say you arrived at Claim 4 from two statements in the NSM. So which one is correct? Arthāpatti does not apply here as I have showed earlier: the presumption P3 is not needed for explaining the observed fact F3.. So may I know how you arrived at Claim 4 from the two statements in the NSM, i.e. which logical device (means) you used to arrive at Claim 4.

As I have showed in the Yoga example above, Chaudhari's conclusion (Claim 3) is an unqualified statement which does not mention type of the work. Your conclusion (Claim 1) is a qualified statement which specifically mentions āstika works. Let's rephrase the Yoga example slightly

  

Researcher 1: Yoga is good for the body.

Researcher 2: Yoga is good for the body for Hindus, and in a way, this is also the conclusion of researcher 1, that I have cited

  

Is citing Researcher 1 in support fair on the part of Researcher 2? Is it not misleading?

Some quick points here

1\) You yourself admit presumptions do not carry burden of proof, then why do you ask for evidence for a presumption which is opposite of your presumption? Furthermore, I presumed the opposite of P3 only to check if there is a contradiction with F3. If there is a contradiction on assuming the opposite of P3, an arthāpatti exists. As I said on August 16:*Quick check to confirm arthāpatti: If the presumption is assumed to be false, there is a contradiction with the observed fact.*

2\) As there was no contradiction found on assuming P3 to be false (i.e., on assuming the opposite of P3), it was concluded that deriving P3 from F3 by arthāpatti was logically incorrect.

3\) Even if you do not want to presume opposite of P3, the same conclusion of a misapplication of will be reached: since P3 is not required to confirm F3, deriving P3 from F3 is a wrong application of*arthāpatti*  

4\) My objection was not to your presumption P3 or if there was evidence for or against it, my objection was *that your presumption P3 could not be arrived at by arthāpatti* as you said in claim

I repeat: you just said presumptions do not carry burden of proof. So why request for evidence for a presumption? Anyway there is no evidence I have for or against P3.   

  

At the end of all this, we have the following situation

  

Claim 1 (Aug 15, HPD): maṅgalācaraṇa is mandatory for āstika granthas as far as I have studied.  

Claim 2 (Aug 15,HPD): It is given in the nyāya-siddhānta-muktāvalī that granthas without maṅgalācaraṇa belong to the nāstikas.

Claim 3 (SC): The conclusion is that mangalagana is necessary for unobstructed completion of the grantha.

Claim 4 (Aug 16 and Aug 17, HPD): āstikāstu īśvaram anyāṁ veṣṭadevatām avaśyamevāṅgīkurvanto granthārambhe (āstikās necessarily remember īśvara or an iṣṭadevatā at the beginning of the grantha).

  

1\) Claim 1 is still not supported by a direct citation from the specific work(s) studied.  

2\) Claim 3 is cited in support of claim 1, but claim 3 is general and claim 1 is specific and so saying that claim 3 too has the same conclusion as claim 1 is unfair (Yoga example)  

  

3\) Claim 2 is different from Claim 1 as it directly attributes a statement to the NSM

4\) Claim 2 is also not yet supported by a citation from the NSM

  

5\) Claim 4 is similar to Claim 1, though not exactly the same  

6\) Claim 4 is different from Claim 2 as Claim 2 attributes a position to the NSM, while claim 4 is based on deductive reasoning

7\) Claim 4 was earlier stated as derived using *arthāpatti*from one statement in NSM commentary. This was shown to be a wrong application of*arthāpatti*

8\) Claim 4 is now stated as derived from two statements in the NSM. The logical device used is not stated, and the reasoning is not clear.

9\) Claim 3 is also cited in support of claim 4, but claim 3 is general and claim 4 is specific about āstika works and so saying that in a way, claim 3 too has the same conclusion as claim 1 is unfair (Yoga example)
