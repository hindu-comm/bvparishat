Here is your comment from August 15:

Quote

*maṅgalācaraṇa is mandatory for āstika granthas as far as I have studied. It is given in the nyāya-siddhānta-muktāvalī that granthas without maṅgalācaraṇa belong to the nāstikas.*

Unquote

  

As you had not cited where the NSM says that granthas without maṅgalācaraṇa belong to the nāstikas, I tried to find a statement to that effect. I could not. In the absence of a citation from you, I thought you had the above statement (*nanu maṅgalaṃ na ... nirvighnaparismāptidarśanāditi cenna*) in mind. I also requested you to let me know if you were referring to some other sentence in my response on August 15:

Quote

*If no, Das may please let us know which sentence of the NSM he had in mind.*

Unquote

  

If I was wrong in my guess, you may still correct me by telling me which statement of the NSM you had in mind when you said on August 15:

Quote

*It is given in the nyāya-siddhānta-muktāvalī that granthas without maṅgalācaraṇa belong to the nāstikas.*

I went through the NSM section, and did not find a statement which you attributed to the NSM on August 15. In the absence of a citation from you, I had no choice but to try to interpret your words. I would not have to do this had you supplied a citation, so you may please do that now.

Here is your comment from August 16:

*maṅgalācaraṇa is mandatory for āstika granthas as far as I have studied. It is given in the nyāya-siddhānta-muktāvalī that granthas without maṅgalācaraṇa belong to the nāstikas.*

*nāstikā hi īśvaram anyāṁ veṣṭadevatāṁ nāṅgīkurvanto granthārambhe (Commentary on NSM). Thus by arthāpattiḥ — astikā tu īśvaram anyāṁ veṣṭadevatām avaśyamevāṅgīkurvanto granthārambhe.*

Unquote

  

That is all you wrote on August 16. You who claimed that the conclusion is arrived at using arthāpatti from the sentence in a commentary on the NSM. In my response on August 16, I showed how based on just the quoted sentence

F3: *nāstikā hi īśvaram anyāṁ veṣṭadevatāṁ nāṅgīkurvanto granthārambhe*

the presumption

P3: *astikā tu īśvaram anyāṁ veṣṭadevatām avaśyamevāṅgīkurvanto granthārambhe*

cannot be arrived at by arthāpatti, as the presumption of the latter is not needed for the former, and there is no contradiction with the former in assuming the opposite of the presumption.

  

As far as my statement is concerned:

Quote

*It is possible that some Āstikas remember, some Āstikas do not remember.*

Unquote

  

It is a *presumption* (and not direct observation), made solely for the purpose of checking if P3 can be arrived at from F3 using arthāpattiḥ. By definition, arthāpatti is not a directly observed fact, but a presumption (assuming something). Here are the definitions again

Śabara: ***the presumption of something not seen on the ground** that a fact already perceived or heard would not be possible without that presumption.*  

Pārthaśārathi: *when we observe that a well-ascertained fact cannot be explained without another fact, **we presume the latter** in order to account for the former and **this presumption is arthāpatti***.

Source: Govardhan P. Bhatt (1989). The Basic Ways of Knowing: An In-depth Study of Kumārila's Contribution to Indian Epistemology. New Delhi: MLBD. ISBN 9788120805804. p. 305. Boldface emphasis is mine.

  

So here is the chain:

1\) You claimed that P3 is derived from F3 usingarthāpatti.

2\) By claiming this, you implied that P3 is not directly observed anywhere and is presumed.

3\) By presuming P3, you also implied that the opposite of P3 is not directly observed anywhere. If the opposite of P3 was directly observed anywhere, you would have known P3 to be false, and you would not have presumed something you know to be false.

4\) As the opposite of P3 is not observed anywhere, there is nothing wrong in presuming the opposite of P3 for the purpose of checking if F3 can be accounted for without the presumption of P3?

  

I showed that the presumption of P3 is not needed for F3, since evenpresuming the opposite of P3 (someāstikas remember, someāstikas do not remember), F3 can be explained. The underlined part is part of a sentence which is the opposite of P3.

  

P3: Āstikas necessarily remember Īśvara or an iṣṭa deity at the beginning of a grantha.

Opposite of P3: Āstikas do not necessarily remember Īśvara or an iṣṭa deity at the beginning of a grantha.

which is same as

Opposite of P3:Some āstikas remember Īśvara or an iṣṭa deity at the beginning of a grantha, some others do not.

  

If you say the opposite of P3 is not supported by nyāya/mīmāṁsā grantha, that is fine, since both P3 and the opposite of P3 are presumptions, and not a direct observations, made for the purpose of checking if the arthāpatti P3 can be derived from F3.



Now that I have clarified my position, can you please answer the two questions:

  

Q1) Which commentary on the NSM are you referring to (please send link to a digital copy if you have one)?

Q2) Is the second statement (astikāstu īśvaram anyāṁ veṣṭadevatām avaśyamevāṅgīkurvanto granthārambhe) arrived at by arthāpatti in this specific commentary on the NSM, or is this your own presumption?

And if I may add  

Q3) Can you please prove how P3 can be arrived at from F3 using arthāpatti, as you claimed in your mail on August 16.

  

śubhamastu
