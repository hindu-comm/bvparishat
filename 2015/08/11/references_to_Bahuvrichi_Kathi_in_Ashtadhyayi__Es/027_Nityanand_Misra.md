Dear Sh. Hari Parshad Das,

  

You claimed you can prove the implication A ⇒ B from a specific statement using arthāpatti.

  

You applied arthāpatti to thatspecificstatement, and you ended up with the converse implication B ⇒ A.

  

You \[still\] have not proved the implication A ⇒ B using arthāpatti.

  

And now you say that the implications A ⇒ B and B ⇒ A are what you would call ‘logically equivalent.’

  

I am not sure how many logicians would agree with you, but thanks for clarifying your thought process anyway.

  

Regards, Nityanand
