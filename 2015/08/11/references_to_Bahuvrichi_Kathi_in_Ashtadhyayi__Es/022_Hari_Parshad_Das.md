**Depends on who is the judge. Moreover, analogies don't work here. In actual vyavahāra, is there a nāstika who wrote maṅgalācaraṇa or an āstika who purposely disregarded it? Also, how did you decide this analogy is the one which fits perfectly in this situation? Is yoga = maṅgalācaraṇa and āstika = body of Hindus and nāstika = body of non-Hindus? How did you decide on quoting this analogy? Has it been quoted previously in the same context by a previous authority? If yes, can you please send me a link/scan of the same?** **I have been asking you quite a few number of times now if all the logic you are quoting has been given in a bona-fide text of nyāya/mīmāṁsā?**  
  

**Statement 1: nāstika's do not perform maṅgalācaraṇa.  
Objection: Where is this specified?  
Counter: This is given in the NSM — vināpi maṅgalaṁ nāstikādīnāṁ granthe.  
**

**Objection: It does not say this specifically. There may be some nāstikas who perform maṅgalācaraṇa.  
**

**Counter: Not in their present lives. In a previous life.  
**

**Objection: Where is this specified?  
**

**Counter: In the NSM — yatra maṅgalaṁ na dṛśyate ...  
**

**Objection: Can a nāstika not perform maṅgalācaraṇa in the current life?  
**

**Counter: No, for he will thus cease to be a nāstika by seeking the favor of a deity.  
**

**Conclusion: A nāstika does not perform maṅgalācaraṇa in his current mode of existence.  
  
**

**Statement 2: maṅgalācaraṇa is mandatory for āstika granthas  
**

**Objection: Where is this specified?  
**

**Counter: in the NSM commentary — nāstikā hi īśvaram anyāṁ veṣṭadevatāṁ nāṅgīkurvanto granthārambhe  
**

**Objection: But this doesn't speak about the āstikas.  
**

**Counter: Sure, but arthāpatti can be used to infer that "āstikāḥ tu īśvaram anyāṁ veṣṭadevatām avaśyamevāṅgīkurvanto granthārambhe"  
**

**Objection: How so?  
**

**Counter: nāstikas do not perform maṅgalācaraṇa (already demonstrated), and yet we see manuscripts from centuries ago that have maṅgalācaraṇa. We have not seen the actual composer compose the manuscript yet it exists. It must have been composed by a human, but it cannot be a nāstika. Thus we postulate that these books belong to the āstikas. (This is the arthāpatti part).  
**

**Objection: What if a nāstika writes a grantha and later an āstika adds a maṅgalācaraṇa?  
**

**Counter: Still, the maṅgalācaraṇa was performed by the āstika and will not benefit the nāstika.  
**

**Objection: This still doesn't prove that all āstikas perform maṅgalācaraṇa.  
**

**Counter: If so, why does the NSM not team in the āstikas with the nāstikas when it says "vināpi maṅgalaṁ nāstikādīnāṁ granthe"? Why does the author single out the nāstikas and their likes? If the author wanted to include āstikas in this list, he would have done so.  
**

**Objection: So there cannot be an āstika who does not perform maṅgalācaraṇa?  
**

**Counter: No. They may or may not write anything in the beginning of the grantha, but in their minds, they always desire the favor of their deity.  
**

**Objection: What if an āstika deliberately does not remember his deity while beginning a grantha?  
**

**Counter: An āstika does not have that durāgrahī propensity due to being śiṣṭa and maṅgalācaraṇa is the default mode of behavior of the śiṣṭas.  
**

**Objection: Where is this given?  
**

**Counter: In the NSM (avigīta-śiṣṭācāra-viṣayatvena....)  
**

**Conclusion: all āstikas definitely perform maṅgalācaraṇa and remember their deities in the beginning of their granthas.  
  
  
**

**PS: So what can be said about the authors Kāśikā-vṛtti? Nothing definite and i had only presented the opinion of a certain group of scholars who surmise that they might have been bauddhas.**
