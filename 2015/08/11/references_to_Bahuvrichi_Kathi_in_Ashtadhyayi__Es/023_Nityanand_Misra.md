The postulation you arrive at is different from the claim you begin with.

  

Observed fact (F): nāstikas do not remember īśvaram/iṣṭadevatā at the beginning of a work

Postulation 1 (P1): maṅgalācaraṇa is mandatory for āstika granthas  

Postulation 2 (P2): manuscripts from centuries ago that have maṅgalācaraṇa belong to the āstikas  

  

P1 and P2 are not observed. You claim P1 can be derived from F by using arthāpatti. You use arthāpatti, but you derive P2.

  

P1 and P2 are not equivalent. This can be logically proven. Paraphrasing both P1 and P2, and ignoring 'centuries ago' (it is irrelevant)

  

Paraphrased Postulation 1 (PP1):If the author of a manuscript is āstika, the manuscript must have maṅgalācaraṇa

Paraphrased Postulation 2 (PP2):If a manuscript has maṅgalācaraṇa, the author the manuscript must be an āstika

  

Let's now denote  

A = author of the manuscript is āstika

B = the manuscript has maṅgalācaraṇa

So PP1 is: A => B  

and PP2 is: B => A

  

A => B is not equivalent to B => A (this is elementary logic)

So PP1 is not equivalent to PP2.

So P1 is not equivalent to P2.

So what you claim to prove is different from what you prove.

  

I do not know your background (natural sciences/engineering/social sciences/traditional), so not sure if the above makes sense to you. But you want to prove A => B, and what you are proving is B => A, which is not the same.
