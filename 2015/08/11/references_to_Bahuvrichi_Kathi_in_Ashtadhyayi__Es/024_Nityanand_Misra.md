Dear Hari Parshad Das,

  

If the above does not make sense to you, you may can refer this document on the website of Virgina Tech University which explains with and example that A => B does not necessarily mean B => A (i.e. the two are not equivalent)

If you are already aware, please ignore.

  

Thanks, Nityanand
