**Before we get into that, lets have a common understanding of the concept of Maṅgalācaraṇa from the Nyāya-siddhānta-muktāvalī. I am copy pasting here S. Ramaswamy's interpretation of that particular section of Nyāya-siddhānta-muktāvalī which he has given in his 'Jyotiṣmati' hindi commentary on Mammaṭa's Kāvya-prakāśa**:

**Also, here is Dr. Satyadev Chaudhari explaining the same in his own way (in the 'Aṁśuprabhā' hindi commentary on Rudraṭa's Kāvyālaṅkāra)**:

**  
If you read the last line, his conclusion too is that it is 'āvaśyaka', which i translated as 'mandatory'.**

**Originally when i was discussing it with Dr. Korada, I was trying to find if there is a śabda-pramāṇa which makes maṅgalācaraṇa mandatory for āstika-granthas. However, as far as i tried, i was not able to find it. The only place I found where the topic has been discussed is in NSM. I had to presume from my study of NSM that since it places āstikas and nāstikas into two distinct categories and since it says that nāstikas never perform maṅgalācaraṇa, therefore it is okay to presume that 'āstikāstu īśvaram anyāṁ veṣṭadevatām avaśyamevāṅgīkurvanto granthārambhe'. In a way, this is also the conclusion of Dr. Satyadev, that i have cited above. Therefore I had said to Dr. Korada that "as far as i have read", it is considered mandatory.

**Presumptions do not carry burden of proof. The only burden is to disprove any evidence to the contrary. Therefore i asked you to cite evidence from a nyāya/mīmāṁsā literature regarding the opposite of P3.  
  
**

P3: Āstikas necessarily remember Īśvara or an iṣṭa deity at the beginning of a grantha.  
  

Opposite of P3: Āstikas do not necessarily remember Īśvara or an iṣṭa deity at the beginning of a grantha.  
  

**My comment**: **There is no evidence regarding this in any nyāya/mīmāṁsā granthas, and these granthas are the only available authorities on the topics of āstika and nāstika maṅgalācaraṇas. If there is any evidence, please bring it to everyone's attention.
