I asked how A) could lead to C). As now you cite the commentary on NSM (and not the NSM as you did earlier), thanks for confirming that there was something amiss in the original reasoning.



Can you please confirm:

Q1)Which commentary you are referring to (please send link to a digital copy if you have one)

Q2) Is the second statement (*astikāstu īśvaram anyāṁ veṣṭadevatām avaśyamevāṅgīkurvanto granthārambhe*) arrived at by*arthāpatti*in this specific commentary on the NSM, or is this your own presumption?



As I show below, the stated presumption cannot be obtained by*arthāpatti*. The definition of*arthāpatti*as per Śabara is

*  
*

*the presumption of something not seen on the ground that a fact already perceived or heard would not be possible without that presumption.*

Pārthaśārathi explains:

*when we observe that a well-ascertained fact cannot be explained without another fact, we presume the latter in order to account for the former and this presumption is arthāpatti.*

  

Source: *Ibid*.



Quick check to confirm*arthāpatti*: If the presumption is assumed to be false, there is a contradiction with the observed fact.



***Example 1 (traditional)***

Fact (F1): Devadatta, who is alive, is not in the house.

Presumption (P1): Devadatta is outside the house.

Why this is a valid *arthāpatti*:

The fact that Devadatta is alive and not in the house cannot be explained without presuming that he is outside the house.

Is there a contradiction if the P1 is not true? Yes.

P1 is not true, so Devadatta is not outside the house. F1 is true, so Devadatta is not in the house. If Devadatta is neither in the house, nor outside, Devadatta must be dead. This contradicts F1 which says Devadatta is alive. A contradiction betweenF1andthe opposite of P1 is proved.



***Example 2 (traditional)***

Observed fact (F2): Devadatta, who is fat, does not eat in the day.

Presumption (P2): Devadatta must eat in the night.

Why this is a valid *arthāpatti*: The fact that Devadatta is fat implies he must eat sometime (in the day or in the night). As he does not eat in the night, he must eat in the day.

Is there a contradiction if P2 is not true? Yes.

P2 is not true, so Devadatta does not eat in the night. F2 is true, so Devadatta does not eat in the day. Devadatta does not eat in the night, and he does not eat in the day, so Devadatta must not eat at all. This means Devadatta cannot be fat. This contradicts F2 which says that Devadatta is fat.A contradiction between F2 and the opposite of P2 is proved.



*Your example*(paraphrasing NSM commentary statement):

Observed fact (F3): Nāstikas do not remember Īśvara or an iṣṭa deity at the beginning of a grantha.

Presumption (P3): Āstikas necessarily remember Īśvara or an iṣṭa deity at the beginning of a grantha

Why this is NOT *arthāpatti*: F3 can be explained even without the presumption. The observation that nāstikas do not remember Īśvara or another iṣṭa deity at the beginning of a grantha can be explained without assuming Āstikas necessarily do it. It is possible that some Āstikas remember, some Āstikas do not remember, and yet all nāstikas do nor remember. So P3 is not a valid presumption.

Is there a contradiction if P3 is not true? No.

P3 is not true means Āstikas do not necessarily remember Īśvara or an iṣṭa deity at the beginning of a grantha. This implies some Āstikas remember some do not. But this does not contradict F3 (Nāstikas do not remember). A contradiction cannot betweenF3and theopposite of P3 cannot be proved, so this is not*arthāpatti.*
