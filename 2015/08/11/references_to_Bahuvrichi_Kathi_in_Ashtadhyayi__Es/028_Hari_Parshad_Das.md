**Once again, i am not sure if this is a judgment or an observation. In either case let the readers decide for themselves. Why is it that after a few messages, i find you passing judgments or observations on me? I have asked you to prove a statement earlier which you yourself admitted that you cannot prove or disprove, and then instead of proving what you have been asked to, you say that i have not proved something. The person who passes a decision in this manner becomes a classic example of a matānujñā-nigraha-sthāna.

**  
Moreover, I am not sure who is demanding the proof here. If it is you who is demanding the proof here, then I would ask you if you want to continue in this thread or whether you want to take it off the group as a private discussion between the both of us? If you want me to prove it again right here that i have shown it by making use of arthāpattiḥ, then i would be more than happy to do so (provided the admins agree).**

**Nothing incorrect in that, and if it is not, please let me know how.**

**and i'm not sure too how many would agree with you. Let them decide on their own I would say.**
