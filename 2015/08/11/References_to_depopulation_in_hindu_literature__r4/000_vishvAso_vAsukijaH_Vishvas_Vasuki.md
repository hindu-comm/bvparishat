मम मित्रं जिज्ञासते -



"can u let me know if u come across any allusions to depopulation due to low birth rate in our literature of the past, i have looked but couldn't find any. Similar to how u find in classical greek and roman writings like that of polybius and Plutarch (eg. <https://twitter.com/Rjrasva/status/627290343080390656/photo/1> ) is what I have in mind"
