(+ विद्वत्-परिषत्)  
नमो नम आर्य गणेश,  
  
इह स्पष्टीकरणम् -  
Sub-replacement fertility levels (which was anything below 2.33 children per woman globally in 2003) leads to population decline (aka depopulation, if this is goes on for long). The words and actions of Julius and Augustus in case of Rome, Polybius and Plutarch in case of Greece indicate that fertility levels of those nations dipped below replacement levels, leading to something of national crises. Modern Indian examples would be:  
\* the Parsi population decline (which saw something like 200 annual births vs 800 deaths)

\* (arguably) the relative increase in Hindu populations in Sikkim and Goa before their annexation/ merger.  
  
Question is, were there sayings comparable to the the Greek and Roman ones cited where our sages lament sub-replacement fertility of a kind occurring not due to calamities, but due to adults simply not being interested in having kids?
