To clarify, we seek cases in our past where our sages lamented the fact that adults too fixated on pleasures (rather than being beset by disasters) are not fulfilling their pitR-rNa, leading to collapse of nation and opportunistic invasions/ subversions. Is it really the first time in our civilization that we see such a disaster looming on the horizon? The following laments from Greece and Rome may help set the context:  

The[Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeks "Greeks")historian[Polybius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polybius "Polybius")largely blamed the decline of the[Hellenistic world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellenistic_period "Hellenistic period")on low fertility rates, writing his work[*The Histories*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Histories_(Polybius) "The Histories (Polybius)")that:

For this evil grew upon us rapidly, and without attracting attention, by our men becoming perverted to a passion for show and money and the pleasures of an idle life, and accordingly either not marrying at all, or, if they did marry, refusing to rear the children that were born, or at most one or two out of a great number, for the sake of leaving them well off or bringing them up in extravagant luxury."^([\[20\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-replacement_fertility#cite_note-20)) |   ” |

In a speech to[Roman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Rome "Ancient Rome")nobles,[Julius Caesar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Caesar "Julius Caesar")commented on the low birthrates of the Roman elite:

We give our allies a share in the government that our numbers may increase; yet you, Romans of the original stock, including Quintii, Valerii, Iulii, are eager that your families and names at once shall perish with you." |
