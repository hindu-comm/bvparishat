Dear list members

  

I am pleased to inform you that my book*Mahāvīrī: Hanumān-Cālīsā*Demystifiedis now available. The book can be purchased online from Amazon India [here](http://www.amazon.in/dp/819311440X)or from the publisher’s website [here](http://www.npsbooks.com/mahavirihcd). The updated preview of the book is available [here](http://www.npsbooks.com/hcmflip/).

  

I am attaching a prologue written for the book byDevarṣi Kalānātha Śāstrī Jī. As it was received after the final proof was sent for printing, it would be included in the second edition of the book.

  

I am also sharing a goodwill message sent by the Honourable Governor of Maharashtra CH. Vidyasagar Rao on the publication of the book.

  

Please pass the information to those who may be interested.

  

Thanks, Nityanand
