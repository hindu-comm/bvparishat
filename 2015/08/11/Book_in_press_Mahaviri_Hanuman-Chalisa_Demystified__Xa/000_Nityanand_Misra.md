***Praise for the book and the author***

  

*“Down through the ages a large number of hymns and stotra-s have been composed in honour of Hanuman—also known as Mahavir. Of these the most popular is Goswami Tulasi Das’s famous forty-verse hymn to Hanuman called the Hanuman Chalisa. This is recited by millions of Hindus everyday around the world. However, analytical work on this text is not easily available. In the present book Shri Nityanand Misra has translated and annotated the text based on the acclaimed Hindi commentary Mahaviri (1983) by Swami Ramabhadracharya. This throws a great deal of light on the deeper meaning of Tulasi Das’s famous work, and will be welcomed by scholars and laymen alike. I commend Shri Nityanand Misra for the devotion and dedication with which he has undertaken this work.“*

*“Inspired in equal measure by profound devotion and immense knowledge, the Mahāvīrī commentary on the beloved and revered Hanumān-Cālīsā will be welcomed by the many devoted reciters of this praise-poem who would like to explore its deeper meanings. Buttressing his insights with numerous citations of authoritative Sanskrit texts and the principal writings of Tulasīdāsa, Svāmī Rāmabhadrācārya both situates the cālīsā in the ancient Hindu literary tradition, and also shows it to contain a veritable distillation or essence of the Rāmayaṇa Kathā. Nityānanda Miśra’s careful English translation, scholarly yet readable, will make these insights accessible to a broader audience.“
