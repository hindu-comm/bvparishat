Dear friends,  
  

The verese in hanuman Chalisha is as follows:  
जुग सहेस जोजन पैर भानु \|  
लिन्यो ताहि मधुर फल जणू \|\|  
  
  
Jug ot yuga is 12,000  
Sahesh or Sahasra is one thousand  
Yuga-sahasra means one million  

Yuga-sahasra yojana means one million yojanas  

  

This verse says that Shri Hanuman thought Bhanu (the Sun) to be a sweet fruit, at a distance of one million yojanas..At the conversion of
12.5 Km per Yojana, the mean distance of the Sun comes out to be 150 million KM, which nearly matches the modern figure.  
  

Regards,
