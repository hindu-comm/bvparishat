Namaste,

  

Thanks for the pdf containing a lot of information. I find from that document that the verse I am looking for, though not mentioned specifically, is a part of the 'Charvaka system' in the Sarvadarśana sangraha by Sāyana-Mādhava. However, as I had mentioned already, the verse is cited by Krishna Misra in his Prabodha Chandrodaya, which is a work admittedly prior to Sāyana. 

  

It is possible that it is in some purāṇa. If I get to know the source that would help me.

  

warm regards
