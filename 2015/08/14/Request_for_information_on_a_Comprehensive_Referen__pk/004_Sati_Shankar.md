Thank you very much Sir for the reference. I was during your presentation on authorship of parishist of Nirukta at the WSC, Bangkok, saw you for the first time but could not talk as I was a stranger there this time despite being a member if IASS,

I am pleased to get in touch here which , I think will be more productive.

Recently I was going through you document at Scribd, probably a copy of your dissertation, ... trikandi.....just in passing bye, and cane at a point where you have discussed about vac, absence of which in relation of conceptualization ..., i will revert back once again for certain queries once i go through it carefully.Last read was just cursory. Hope you will not mind.

Regards

Sati Shankar
