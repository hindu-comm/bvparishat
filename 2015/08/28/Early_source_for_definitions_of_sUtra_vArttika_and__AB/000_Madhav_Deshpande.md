Hello BVP Colleagues,

  

Some of you may find this information useful.

  

  

  

I found an edition of Parāśara-Upapurāṇa on the website of MAHARISHI UNIVERSITY OF MANAGEMENT VEDIC LITERATURE COLLECTION. Vaidyanātha Payagunde's Chāyā on Nāgeśa's Uddyota on Mahābhāṣya (NSP edn, 1917, intro verses of Chāyā) quotes the well known definitions of Sūtra, Vārttika and Bhāṣya, and he refers to Parāśarapurāṇa. I found these verses in the Parāśarapurāṇa. I am giving detailed references below:

  

pāṇinīyaṃ mahāśāstraṃ padasādhutvalakṣaṇam /ad viśvatomukham

sarvopakārakaṃ grāhyam kṛtsnaṃ tyājyaṃ na kiñcana //

Verse 29, Adhyāya 8, p. 22

  

alpākṣaramasandigdhaṃ sāravad viśvatomukham /

astobham anavadyaṃ ca sūtraṃ sūtravido viduḥ //

Verse 13cd 14ab, Adhyāya 18, p. 63

  

sūtrārtho varṇyate yatra vākyaiḥ sūtrānukāribhiḥ /

svapadāni ca varṇyante bhāṣyam bhāṣyavido viduḥ //

Verse 15cd 16ab, Adhyāya 18, p. 63

  

uktānuktaduruktānāṃ cintā yatra pravartate /

taṃ granthaṃ vārttikaṃ prāhur vārttikajñā manīṣiṇaḥ //

Verse 19cd 20ab, Adhyāya 18, p. 63

  

The Parāśarapurāṇa is perhaps the earliest source for these definitions, which are then cited by many different authors in different traditions.
