There is nothing new in the way of derivation than already discussed and HariParshada has given the episode making Ganesha first and foremost deity before any act. Even without quoting the dictionary entries, the usage of the word Kunjara was already explained. Only your interpretation of the verb भिदिर् विदारणे out of context explanation is new as " 'one, who is the guide to understand the meaning of preeminent Godhood.' is new and I doubt whether such meaning could be derived from the compound.
