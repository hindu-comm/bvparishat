I mixed up the sutra numbers in the above two paras. It should be 3.3.113 throughout (I am referring to kṛtyalyuṭo bahulam). Here are the paras again with the correction. Sorry for any inconvenience:

  

It is a new interpretation (or is it a revelation?) that bahulam in A 3.3.113 means that even suffixes apart from kṛtya or lyuṭ can be used. All traditional commentaries interpret bahulam to mean that kṛtya and lyuṭ can occur in different meanings from those stated in the A. Can you please cite one reliable source in support of this new interpretation? If not, then it is your word versus traditional commentaries. 

  

You cite derivations of kālindibhedanaḥ in SKD and Amarapadavivṛti in support of your new interpretation. But do these two sources say in their derivation of kālindibhedanaḥ that the suffix lyu in from A 3.3.113? At least SKD does not. So how can SKD be cited as a support of your novel interpretation of bahulam on A 3.3.113? I have not seen Amarapadavivṛti, but does that give A 3.3.113 as the rule for lyu in the derivation? If that also does not, then you have no source to back your interpretation.
