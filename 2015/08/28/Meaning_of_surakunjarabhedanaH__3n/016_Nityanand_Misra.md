This post does not offer a solution to the original question, but evaluates the vigrahas shown for the term **surakuñjarabhedanaḥ** by Sh. Hari Parshad Das and Dr. H N Bhat.



Sh. Hari Parshad Das offered the following vigraha:

  

surakuñjaraṃ bhinatti iti surakuñjarabhedanaḥ \[sic\]

  

This vigraha is not correct since there is no rule in the Aṣṭādhyāyī (nor any vārttika) which ordains the suffix lyuṭ in the sense of an agent (kartṛ) from a root with an upapada denoting the karma.**If the vigraha is surakuñjaraṃ bhinatti, the samāsa cannot be surakuñjarabhedanaḥ.** For this vigraha, the samāsa can be surakuñjarabhedaḥ instead. It can also be surakuñjarabhit (with the optional form surakuñjarabhid). In both casesthe samāsa is byrule2.2.19 upapadamatiṅ.



For surakuñjarabhedaḥ, the suffix aṇ is ordained from the root bhid with an upapada denoting karma by the rule**3.2.1****karmaṇyaṇ**in the sense of an agent. Here is kāśikā (boldface emphasis mine):

3.2.1 karmaṇyaṇ:sarvatra **karmaṇi upapade** dhātoḥ aṇ pratyayo bhavati।

Why is this in the sense of agent? By 3.4.67 kartari kṛt, a kṛt affix occurs in the sense of an agent unless otherwise stated. As nothing about the sense is stated here, thekṛtsuffix is in the sense of an agent (kartṛ).



In the case of surakuñjarabhit/surakuñjarabhid, the suffix kvip is ordained from the root bhid when with an upapada by the rule**3.2.76****kvip ca**in the sense of an agent. Here is kāśikā again (bolface emphasis mine):

3.2.76 kvip ca:sarvadhātubhyaḥ **sopapadebhyo** nirupapadebhyaśca chandasi bhāṣāyāṃ ca kvip pratyayo bhavati।

Again, as nothing about the sense is stated here, thekṛtsuffix is in the sense of an agent (kartṛ) by 3.4.67 kartari kṛt.



However, there is no rule which ordains the suffix lyuṭ from a root with a karma upapada in the sense of an agent (kartṛ). As far as I know, the only rule which ordains the suffix lyuṭ from a root with a karma upapada is

3.3.116 karmaṇi ca yena saṃsparśāt kartuḥ śarīrasukham

However, this rule carries forward both napuṃsake (=in the neuter gender) and bhāve (=in the sense of verbal activity) from 3.3.114 napuṃsake bhāve ktaḥ. Here is kāśikā again (boldface emphasis mine):

3.3.116 karmaṇi ca yena saṃsparśāt kartuḥ śarīrasukham:yena karmaṇā saṃspṛśyamānasya kartuḥ śarīrasukham utpadyate, tasmin karmaṇi upapade dhatoḥ **napuṃsakaliṅge bhāve** lyuṭ pratyayo bhavati।



Now surakuñjarabhedanaḥ is neither in neuter gender, nor is it in the sense of verbal action as per the explanation offered by Sh. Das. Hence the vigraha surakuñjaraṃ bhinatti for surakuñjarabhedanaḥ is not correct as there is no rule to support the required affix and upapada compound.



**surakuñjaraṃ bhinatti iti surakuñjarabhedaḥsurakuñjarabhitvāna tu surakuñjarabhedanaḥ**



Dr. Bhat has offered thecorrect vigraha for surakuñjarabhedanaḥ in his post.

surakuñjarāṇāṃ bhedanaḥ surakuñjarabhedanaḥ

One can also say

surakuñjarasya bhedanaḥ surakuñjarabhedanaḥ

The genitive case in surakuñjarasya/surakuñjarāṇāṃ is by the rule 2.3.65 kartṛkarmaṇoḥ kṛti. Then the samāsa is by the vārttika 2.2.8 kṛdyogā ca (kṛdyogā ca ṣaṣṭhī samasyate iti vaktavyam)  



Hence the vigraha offered by Dr. Bhat is correct, the one by Sh. Das is incorrect. The correct vigraha needs to be supported by rules for both the affix and the compound.
