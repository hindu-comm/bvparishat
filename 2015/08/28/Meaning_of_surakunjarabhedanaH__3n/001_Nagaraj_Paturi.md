In Ganesha Ashtottara shata namavali, one of the namas is



'kunjarasurabhanjana'



In one of the kirtanas by Sri Muttuswamy Dikshitar, Ganesha is addressed as



kunjara bhanjana



Elsewhere , he is called matta sura bhanjana



Comparing 'surakunjarabhedana' and 'kunjarasurabhanjana', we can see that there is an exchange of positions of the words sura and kunjara between the two.

Elephants of gods makes surakunjara shashthi tatpurusha samasa. Exchange of positions of the words is not possible in shashthi tatpurusha samasa.



So the Marathi commentary's interpretation is not tenable.
