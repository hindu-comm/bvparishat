Dear Sh. Das

  

It is a new interpretation (or is it a revelation?) that bahulam in A 3.1.134 means that even suffixes apart from kṛtya or lyuṭ can be used. All traditional commentaries interpret bahulam to mean that kṛtya and lyuṭ can occur in different meanings from those stated in the A. Can you please cite one reliable source in support of this new interpretation? If not, then it is your word versus traditional commentaries. 

  

You cite derivations of kālindibhedanaḥ in SKD and Amarapadavivṛti in support of your new interpretation. But do these two sources say in their derivation of kālindibhedanaḥ that the suffix lyu in from A 3.1.134? At least SKD does not. So how can SKD be cited as a support of your novel interpretation of bahulam on A 3.1.134? I have not seen Amarapadavivṛti, but does that give A 3.1.134 as the rule for lyu in the derivation? If that also does not, then you have no source to back your interpretation.

This is what you said

Quote

भिनत्ति तमिति भेदनः (from 3.3.113) — apply lyu inkarmārthausing this rule  

Unquote

  

You said *in karmārtha*. Now you say you meant *karma-vibhakti-artha*and not *karmaṇi*. You also say you were clear in what you said\[!!\]. Anyway*karma-vibhakti-artha* is a new terminology to me. Can you please define this new term*karma-vibhakti-artha*? How is it different from*karmaṇi*(or is it the same)?

  

You point to *apasecanam* in Nyasa says:

Quote

*apasecanam iti*, *apasicyate taditi karmaṇi lyuṭ*.

Unquote

So Nyāsa clearly says*karmaṇi* on*apasecanam*(it has the suffixlyuṭin sense of object). You say apasecanam inNyāsais an example of*karma-vibhakti-artha.* This suggests you think*karmaṇi* and this new term*karma-vibhakti-artha* are the same. However, you also say
“I meant karma-vibhakti-artha not karmaṇi.” This suggests you think they are different. So what do you think - are*karma-vibhakti-artha* and*karmaṇi* different or the same?

*  
*

Furthermore, *apasicyate* is passive voice and the word*apasecanam* is aptly in the sense of object. In what you said (*bhinatti tam itibhedanaḥ),**bhinatti* is in active voice and the word*bhedanaḥ*is in the sense of an agent. Then how can the two be both examples of the same thing which you call*karma-vibhakti-artha*?

See above. Not only is the above statement a new opinion, it is not backed by works you cite as they have not traced the suffix lyu to A 3.3.113. I have no problem with new opinions, but if you claim the support of other works by assuming things. This is not sound reasoning.

Okay, we can ignore 3.1.134 now. Let's focus on 3.3.113.

Does Amarapadavivṛti mention bahulam in the derivation? Can you please share the scan of the page for my benefit?

Gauṇakarma is present for doubly transitive roots (dvikarmaka dhātu-s) which can take two objects, one primary and one secondary. Is bhid a dvikarmaka root? Can you cite a source for this? Or can you show examples where usages of bhid have a primary and secondary object?

  

This thread is very enlightening,we may be at the cusp of some new discoveries in the field of Sanskrit grammar.
