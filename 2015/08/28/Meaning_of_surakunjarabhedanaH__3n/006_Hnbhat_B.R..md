Further, in spite of exercise of grammar and Purana, how to relate the first part of the line दानवैरर्चितश्चेत्त्वं when/if you were/are(?) worshiped by the असुर-s, then you become(became).:सुरकुञ्जरभेदनः either the context from Purana or grammar or taking it as conditional if you are worshiped by the demons (in the begining of the waging wars with the sura-s, you bestow victory for them) by being the destroyer(repeller) of the elephant/s of Sura-s. cet tadaa will guide some interpretation in either case as a statement of episode ( suppported by Purana-s) or an exageration of his power of bestowing victory to his devotees even they be the the demons.
