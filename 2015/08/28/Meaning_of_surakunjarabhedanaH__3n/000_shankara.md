Pranams to all,

  

643rd name in Ganesa Sahasranama is सुरकुञ्जरभेदनः. Bhaskararaya explains it as follows - दानवैरर्चितश्चेत्त्वं सुरकुञ्जरभेदनः। A Marathi commentary at [श्रीगणेशसहस्त्रनाम - श्लोक १११ ते १२०](http://www.transliteral.org/pages/z130407051753/view) explains that when propitiated by the asuras, Ganesa crushes the elephants of the gods. I am a bit confused by this explanation.  

  

Gods are usually described as protecting the Suras, not the Asuras. Is there any story in any Puranas that describes Ganesa helping the Asuras? I request scholars to help me understand this name of Ganesa.



regards  
shankara
