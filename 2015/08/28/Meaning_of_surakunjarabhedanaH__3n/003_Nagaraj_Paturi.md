Shankarji,



I have no idea.



kunjarabhanjana has been explained as 'killer of gajasura'



Did kunjarashirabhanjana turn into kunjarasurabhanjana during manuscript copy makings at some stage? is one possibility.



But surakunjarabhedana comes in the way of such interpretation.



Even if there were to be a sura called kunjara, surakunjarabhedana can not mean killing that sura.



There probably is some puranic story. But I do not know that.
