Bhat Mahodaya,  

  

I had assumed that there would be some Puranic episode in which Ganesa Himself fought against the Devas. That is why I wrote that the story of Tripurasura doesn't directly relate to the epithet of Ganesa under discussion. I might be wrong in assuming the existence of such story.

shankara
