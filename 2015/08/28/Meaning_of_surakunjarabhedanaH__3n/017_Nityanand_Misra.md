Dear Sh. Das  

  

Do the Amarapadavivṛti and Śabdakalpadruma state that their explanation of this word is a *vigraha vākya* of the compound in question? Dictionaries and commentaries explain a word in various ways, it is not necessary that each explanation is a vigraha vākya of the compound being explained.

  

Here is the decisive litmus test: can you please show the prakriyā of the upapada samāsa with lyu/lyuṭ? Which precise rule results in the upapada samāsa with a lyu/lyuṭ suffix ordained in the sense of an agent by 3.1.134/3.3.113 as you suggest? If a complete prakriyā cannot be shown, then the samāsa cannot be derived from the vigraha vākya.

I did not say lyu is not applicable in the sense of agent. Here is my statement again:

Quote

However, there is no rule which ordains the suffix lyuṭ from a root**with a karma upapada**in the sense of an agent (kartṛ).

Unquote

  

There is a clause*with a karma upapada*in my statement.

Does 3.3.113 has a karma upapada condition? No.

Do any commentaries say that this rule covers karma upapada? No.

Does any commentary give an example under 3.3.113 which is an upapada samasa with karma upapada? No.

So how does 3.3.113 ordaining lyuṭ in the sense of agent contradict what I said?Can you please explain?
