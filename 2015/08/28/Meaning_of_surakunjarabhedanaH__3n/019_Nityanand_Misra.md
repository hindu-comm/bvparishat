You yourself mentioned the suffix lyu in your mail on August 29:

Quote

*apply suffix 'ल्यु' to भिद then use the rule yu-vor anAkau*  

Unquote

  

The suffix lyu is different from the suffix lyuṭ. The latter has ṭ as a marker (it), the former does not. As far as I know, only 3.1.134 talks about lyu (without the ṭ marker). If you did not mean 3.1.134, could you please clarify which other rule did you have in mind when you proposed lyu?

How is lyu is in sense of karma? SKD says it is in sense of kartṛ (and you yourself said "ल्यु is applicable in karttari" in your previous message). Now you say the meaning is karma? If lyu is in karma, then the derivation should be*bhidyate iti bhedanaḥ*, and not*bhinatti iti bhedanaḥ*. Please clarify if you want the suffix in the sense of object (karma) or agent (kartṛ).

Firstly 3.3.113 talks about lyuṭ and not lyu. So please clarify clearly if you want lyu here or lyuṭ.

1\) If you want lyu, as you say, then 3.3.113 kṛtyalyuṭo bahulam does not apply and so the above reasoning also does not apply.

2\) If you want lyuṭ then 3.1.134 nandigrahipacādibhyo lyuṇinyacaḥ does not apply.

We have to get the precise and full derivation, else it becomes guesswork.  

  

Secondly, the bahula option as explained in commentaries is that thekṛtya and lyuṭ affixes occur from a root in other meanings than those stated in the Aṣṭādhyāyī. It does not say they occur from a root with an upapada. You may refer S C Vasu, R N Sharma, or any other standard text. If any commentary says that kṛtya and lyuṭ can also occur with upapadas also as a result of bahulam in 3.3.113, it can be accepted. But assuming it is problematic.

Even if you assume it, which word do you read in the locative case in 3.3.113 to qualify as upapada? By the rule 3.1.92tatropapadaṃ saptamīstham, an upapada is a word in the locative case. So even if you extend, going against tradition, to apply this in case of upapada, how does one get a generic karma upapada in absense of the word karmaṇi in the locative case? Is this interpretation backed by specific commentary on this rule?

There is nothing wrong with this part (bhinatti iti bhedanaḥ). The problem is with the vigraha surakuñjaraṃ bhinatti iti surakuñjarabhedanaḥ. The two are not the same.

This new vigraha that is offered is itself is problematic to begin with. One must have a dvitīyā vibhakti before a dvitīyā tatpuruṣa samāsa can take place (the vigraha comes first, the samāsa later). What rule results in the dvitīyā vibhakti here? When surakuñjara is used as karman with the kṛdanta word bhedana, the rule 2.3.65 kartṛkarmaṇoḥ kṛti blocks the rule 2.3.2 karmaṇi dvitīyā. The rules that block 2.3.65, namely 2.3.69 na lokāvyayaniṣṭhākhalarthatṛnām and 2.3.70 akenorbhaviṣyadādhamarṇyayoḥ, do not apply in this case. Hence by 2.3.65 the correct usage is surakuñjarasya bhedanaḥ, and not surakuñjaraṃ bhedanaḥ.

  

The case of gamyādīnām is totally different. In case of the vigraha state of compounds like kaṣṭaśritaḥ=kaṣṭaṃ śritaḥ, 2.3.69 blocks application of 2.3.65 (as śrita is ktānta). As 2.3.65 is itself blocked, there is nothing to block 2.3.2 and so dvitīyā vibhakti is produced, resulting in the uncompounded usage**kaṣṭaṃ śritaḥ** which is compounded by 2.1.23 dvitīyā śritātīta ... In case of the vigraha state of compounds covered by gamyādīnāmupasaṅkhyānam (e.g. grāmagamī), again the rule 2.3.65 is blocked, this time by 2.3.66 akenorbhaviṣyadādhamarṇyayoḥ. This results in 2.3.2 applying to give us the uncompounded usage**grāmam gamī** which is compounded as grāmagamī.

  

But in case of using the word with the kṛdanta bhedanaḥ, neither 2.3.69 nor 2.3.70 can block 2.3.65 because their conditions are not met. Hence 2.3.65 prevails to result in the usage surakuñjarasya bhedanaḥ.

This is a novel interpretation. Can you tell me whichPāṇinian rule be used to transform atiṅanta into a subanta before compounding?
