Hari Parshad Dasji,  

  

Thank you very much for interpreting सुरकुञ्जरभेदनः and also for the popular story in support of it.  

  

This story is seen in various websites with variations. In most cases, the competition is between Ganesa and his brother Kumara. Can we conclude that the above name of Ganesa is based on this story?  



regards  
shankara

The term सुरकुञ्जर can be interpreted as सुराणां कुञ्जरः "best among gods", which means it refers to Indra.  
  
according to Shabda-kalpadruma, the term कुञ्जरः when applied as the latter term in a samAsa can mean "श्रेष्ठ" \| उत्तरपदे श्रेष्ठवाचकः । यथा पुरुषकुञ्जर \|  
  
apply suffix 'ल्यु' to भिद then use the rule yu-vor anAkau  
  
the vigraha is — "सुरकुञ्जरं भिनत्ति अर्थात्तस्य मानं विमर्दयति इति सुरकुञ्जरभेदनः"  
  
I am attaching a story here which explains how he defeated all gods, headed by Indra. This is a popular story:
