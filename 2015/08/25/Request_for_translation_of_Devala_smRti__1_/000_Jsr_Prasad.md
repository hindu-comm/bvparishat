Respected Scholars,  
  

Namaste. I received the following message from Professor Aloka Parasher-sen, Professor in the Dept. of History and Director, International Affairs, University of Hyderabad. I am told that no translation is available on Devalasmṛti till date. May I request you to offer your responses or forward to the interested scholars, preferably off the list. I highly appreciate any response in this context. File is attached herewith.  
  

With heartfelt greetings on forthcoming saṃskṛtasaptāha!  

  

Kind regards,  

Prasad

Dear Professor Prasad,

I need a translator from Sanskrit to English who can help me translate the Devala Smriti. I could pay for this service.

I attach a soft copy of this Smriti for your kind perusal and help. Kindly let me know if this is possible.

with best regards,

sincerely,

aloka parasher sen**
