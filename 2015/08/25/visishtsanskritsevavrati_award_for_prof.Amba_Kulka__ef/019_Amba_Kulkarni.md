Thank you everybody for your encouraging words. Many of you have also written to me off the list.  

  
I am happy that the field of Sanskrit Computational Linguistics has got a recognition.  
  
I consider this award an honor for all of us who have been working in this field for the past 2-3 decades. Our collective efforts have resulted into work useful to the society, and worth this recognition.  
  
I hope this field gets more and more such recognition and support.  
  

With regards,  

Amba Kulkarni
