Dear Scholars,  

  

Namaste.  

  

On behalf of Scholars and Students of Department of Sanskrit Studies, University of Hyderabad, Hyderabad, I take privilege to inform you all that our guide and mentor Prof.Amba Kulkarni, will be honoured for the prestigious award of "विशिष्टसंस्कृतसेवाव्रती-2015" on 26-08-2015 by Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan, Delhi.  

It is not exaggeration to comment that the said title of the award is so apt and perfect for her that she always indulges and dedicates herself in the services of Sanskrit language.  
  

May she get many more such awards and honours.  

  

Thanks & regards,  

Dr. RYALI ANUPAMA,  

POST DOCTORAL FELLOW - U.G.C.,
