I extend my heartiest congratulations to Dr. Amba Kulkarni for the well-deserved honour. I first came to know about her and her work in January 2009 when I was at theThird International Sanskrit Computational Linguistics Symposium in Hyderabad. Dr. Kulkarni and Prof. Gérard Huet were the program chairs. If I remember correctly, Springer Verlag started publishing the proceedings of the symposia with this third symposium. The event was meticulously planned and very well managed by Dr. Kulkarni and Prof. Huet. It was Dr. Kulkarni who had the vision to invite none other than Prof. S D Joshi as the keynote speaker (he mentioned this in his [speech](http://sanskrit.uohyd.ernet.in/Symposium/papers/joshi.pdf)). I have interacted with Dr. Kulkarni over email on several occasions since then, and I have always admired her expertise in and relentless devotion to the fields of Sanskrit grammar and computational linguistics. She is one of the few scholars today who are equally well-versed in both Sanskrit grammar and computer science. The variety of computational tools developed by the University of Hyderabad under her supervision bear testimony to this. I wish her even more success in the future.
