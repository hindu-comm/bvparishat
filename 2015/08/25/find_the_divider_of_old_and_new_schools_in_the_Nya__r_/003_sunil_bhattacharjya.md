Dear friends,  
  
The second question is interesting as it has to do with the fact as to
how the Navyanyaya came to be and whether it all really started with Gangesha.  
  
As regards Nyaya, if we look at it historically, the Nyayasutra of Gautama had been the only dominant Nyaya text in the pre-Buddha times. This Gautama is believed to be the same as the Gautama, who wrote a Smriti and according to Vedavyasa the Gautma Smriti was followed in the Treta yuga and this was replaced by Shankha-Llikhita in the Dwapara yuga.  
  

Gangesha is certainly an early stalwart of Navyanyaya who can never be ignored but historically he was not necessarily the first person who can be called the father of Navyanyaya. There have been people who think Vachaspati Mishra of the Mithilal-school to be the first person, while there are others who think the credit goes to Udayana. But one has to be fair to the Biddhisits nyayayikas including Dignaga, who came about one thousand years after Lord Buddha (Purana tells us that Lord Buddha
lived in the 19th century BCE) and his follower Dharmakirti followed him. This duo really started a new Nyaya school alternate to the Nyayasutra of Gautama. Thus it is only logical that one should trace the beginning of the History of Navyanyaya (literally new logical system), right from the Buddhist logicians, who sowed the seed.
