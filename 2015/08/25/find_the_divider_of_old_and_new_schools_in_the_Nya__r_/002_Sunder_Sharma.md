sir

I am working on second case of Vyutpattivada. I have available all commentaries.

Gadadhar is a part of Navya nyaya school. he was in 17th century. 

he quoted so many concepts of old nyaya school.

I have already seen most commentaries and other related books but no one mentioned primary sources. all mentioned only secondary sources.
