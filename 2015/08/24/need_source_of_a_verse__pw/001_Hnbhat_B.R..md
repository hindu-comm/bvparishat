Somebody had asked the same question last week:

  

<https://groups.google.com/d/msg/bvparishat/3rmaA6K_QuM/HOgGt1rUIwAJ>  

  

and the complete verse is available on the net. But not the source is mentioned.

  

It may not be always possible find the source for some Subhashita. If known, the compilers or the editors give generally the source. Look up in MahasubhashitaSangraha of Ludwik,it is there and the source is not given in the webpage. It is not in SubhashitaratnaBhandagara of kashinatha Sharma. Other anthologies may be referred to.
