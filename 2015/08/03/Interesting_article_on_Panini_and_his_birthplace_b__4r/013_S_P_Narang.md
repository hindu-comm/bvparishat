Prof. Kapur, It is a paper not only on theory and sastra, but it is my observations of a number of dialects which are known to me and through Turner and persons of the area of Sialkot. The tradition like that of anaci ca continues even today. A number of references from the competent scholars are the corroborative evidences, I have met U once at IGNCA. Regds, spnarang
