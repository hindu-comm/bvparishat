The book “The linguistic atom and the origin of language” by Gauri Dhrampal edited by Gautam Dharmpal , proves that Salatura is in Bankura district of West Bengal. She wrote

"Panini was born at salatura or today's Saltada of Bankura district of Banga in about 3400 years from now. He was schooled in the famed institute of Dakshayayan Vyadi......he travelled (extensively) on foot, on horse, in carts...collecting all the materials and sat down at a secluded place of his choice to write down Astadhyayi writing on palm leaves and paper like birch-barks. ....at the end of his life he settled down at Taksashila and passed away there" ( pg. 211)

The book is very interesting and she speaks "with conviction which can come only from profound insight.."

will establish Panini in new glory....a strong wave is current in England's education centres to reassess English grammar in Panini's line"
