My late colleague Professor Ian Catford from the University of Michigan many years ago visited Chota Lahur, the old Śalatura, in the Swat Valley of Pakistan, and told me that the local farmers had heard about Panini being from their town. My other colleague from Michigan, Professor Peter Hook brought a potsherd from this place for me. So I have the pleasure of physically touching an object from the birthplace of Panini.
