Thanks to Prof. Deshpande for sharing this heartening article.



"And today we find no takers for a fresh statue of ***our* great ancestor** being put up in his place of birth. "



"**We are heirs to greatness**. But we do nothing when this greatness is destroyed in the most wanton fashion. "

reveals a great spirit.



These two countries experiencing an unfortunate political divide share common legacy in all such aspects.



If the destruction of archaeological sites happens in Pakistan for one reason, neglect and destruction due to ignorance etc. are found in our country too.



Brave and good hearts like the author of this piece canhelp the people to people cordial relations between the two countries. 



I am ecstatic with the sahAnubhUti with the feeling



"So I have the pleasure of physically touching an object from the birthplace of Panini."



Lucky you are Prof. Deshpande.



This pleasure is puNya.



Thanks again.
