Here is a beautiful verse from the जगगन्नाथस्तोत्र

रत्नाकरस्तव गृहं गृहिणी च पद्मा किं देयमस्ति भवते पुरुषोत्तमाय ! अाभीरवामनयनाहृतमानसाय दत्तं मनो यदुपते त्वरितं गृहाण ॥ १॥

On lord of the Yadu' dynasty! Your house is the treasure of gems (the ocean) and your wife (गृहिणी the house keeper) is पद्मा (the goddess of wealth).  
(So) what I could offer to you (whose dwells in the treasury of gems and the goddess of wealth herself takes care of the house)? There is nothing you may need anything that I can give you.  
But my mind (मनः) I (would) offer to you, whose mind (मानस) was taken away by the cowherd girls.  
(Since you had lost your mind taken away by the gopi-s you are wanting it. Hence I can offer my mind for you. This inferred by the devotee the heartless Lord had not compassion towards his requests and he is wanting it. So devotee is having a mind and wealthier than the Lord. In this verse all the words are full of suggested meanings).
