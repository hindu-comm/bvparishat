Sharma ji

  

Greetings.

  

I don't know if Kalidasa wrote a similar verse, but there is this verse in Ramayana (Sundarakanda)

  

वृक्षेभ्यः पतितैः पुष्पैर्वकीर्णा पृथग्विधैः।रराज वसुधातत्र प्रमदा इव विभूषिता ॥५-१४-१३॥  

  

Meaning: There, the ground (or earth, if one wants to generalize) is resplendent, like a woman adorned with ornaments, with different types of flowers, falling from trees, spread all over.

  

Regards

N. Siva Senani
