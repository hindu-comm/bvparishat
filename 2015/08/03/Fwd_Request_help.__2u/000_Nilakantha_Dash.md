Dear parishat, Here is a question. If anybody can help Mr. Murli Sharma from ICRICat.ndash  

Dear Prof. Dash,

Greetings.

My name is Murli Sharma. I am an Agriculture Researcher. I work at ICRISAT.

I request a help.

I am looking for a Sanskrit Shlok by Shri Kalidas.

This is about trees which beautify earth. In school,we were reciting this every Friday after prayer. This was in mid sixties.

I have put an attachment wherein I have tried to write it from my memory. This is neither full nor correct.

Could you kindly help me get the correct text of this famous shlok of Shri Kalidas. I wish to put this in the begining of a document on plants.

Thanks and kind regards.

Murli Sharma

ICRISAT.
