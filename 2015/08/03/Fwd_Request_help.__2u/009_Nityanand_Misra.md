Some comments on the translation:

1) रराज is third person singular conjugation in the लिट् लकार, which occurs in the ‘non-today’ (अनद्यतन) unseen (परोक्ष) past (भूत) by the rule परोक्षे लिट् (३.२.११५). The translation ‘is resplendent,’ or ‘shines,’ is in the present simple tense. A more accurate translation would be ‘was resplendent,’ or ‘shone,’ to indicate the past (भूत).

  

2) पतितैः has the suffix क्त which is used in the sense of agent by गत्यर्थाक्रमकश्लिषशीङ्स्थाऽअसवसजनरुहजीर्यतिभ्यश्च (३.४.७२). The suffix क्त is usually used in the past by by निष्ठा (३.२.१०२), and sometimes in the present by मतिबुद्धिपूजार्थेभ्यश्च (३.२.१८८). The sense is less likely to be मति, बुद्धि or पूजा here, and though the चकार in 3.2.188 is extended by commentators to elsewhere, from the context, it is less likely to be a usage in the present (‘falling’) than past (‘fallen’) – it makes more sense for the ground to have been resplendent with flowers that had ‘fallen from trees’ rather than those which were ‘falling from trees.’

  

3) In the verse, the adjective अवकीर्णा qualifies वसुधा (and not पुष्पैः), whereas in the translation, the phrase ‘spread all over’ qualifies flowers. A slight rewording like ‘ground covered with flowers’ or ‘ground strewn with flowers,’ with the adjectival phrase qualify ‘ground’ gives a more accurate translation of ‘पुष्पैः अवकीर्णा वसुधा.’

  

The translation may be changed as: *There, the ground (or earth), covered with different kinds of flowers which had fallen \[down\] from trees, was resplendent like a young woman adorned \[with ornaments/flowers\].*

  

Here is Gita Press’Hindi translation (VR, Part II, 17^(th) edition, 1997, p. 53): वृक्षोंसे झड़कर गिरे हुए भाँति- भाँतिके फूलोंसे आच्छादित हुई वहाँकी भूमि फूलोंके शृङ्गारसे विभूषित हुई युवती स्त्रीके समान शोभा पाने लगी।

  

The GP translation uses past tense for both रराज and पतितैः, and has the translation of अवकीर्णा (=आच्छादित) qualifying the translation of वसुधा (=भूमि). Also note that the GP translationemploys अध्याहार by adding the word झड़कर (=‘abscised’) to qualify fallen leaves, and देहलीदीपकन्याय to take the अन्वय of पुष्पैः at two places as पुष्पैः अवकीर्णा वसुधा (=‘ground covered with flowers’) and पुष्पैः विभूषिता प्रमदा (=‘young woman adorned with flowers’).
