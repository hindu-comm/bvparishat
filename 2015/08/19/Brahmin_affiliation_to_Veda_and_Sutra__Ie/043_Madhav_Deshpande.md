Dear BVP Colleagues,

  

  This whole discussion has been very useful. I have discussed some of these issues in an article that was published a few years ago, and I have attached the pdf of that article. In posting a question on this list, I was specifically interested in what happens to Dvivedis, Trivedis and Chaturvedis, and some of the responders have pointed out that even these reciters perform their personal/family rituals only according to their svaśākhā. I once again thank everyone who responded to my questions. With best wishes,
