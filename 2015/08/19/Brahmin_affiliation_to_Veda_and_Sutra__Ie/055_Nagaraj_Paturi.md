Portion relevant to the present thread from Prof. Deshpande's article shared recently in the thread by him is as follows (pp. 345-346):



In support of this conclusion, Rāmakriṣṇa cites a number of traditional

authorities (Saṃskāragaṇapati, pp. 9–10):

**

*tathā cāṅgirāḥ*: *sve sve gr̥hye yathā proktās tathā saṃsktayo ’khilāḥ*, *kartavyā bhūtikāmena nānyathā bhūtim r̥cchati*.

**

*gr̥hyakārikāyām api*: *pāramparyagato yeṣāṃ vedaḥ saparibṃhaṇaḥ*, *tacchākhaṃ karma kartavyaṃ tacchākhādhyayanaṃ tathā*. *adhītya śākhām ātmīyāṃ paraśākhāṃ tataḥ paṭhet*, *svaśākhāṃ tu parityajya śākhāraṇḍaḥ sa ucyate*.

**

*tathā ca vīramitrodaye vasiṣṭhaḥ*: *yacchākhīyais tu saṃskāraiḥ saṃskr̥to brāhmaṇo bhavet*, *tacchākhādhyayanaṃ kāryam anyathā patito bhavet*.

**

*śākhāntarīyakarmakaraṇe doṣam āha vasiṣṭhaḥ*: *na jātu paraśākhoktaṃ budhaḥ karma samācaret*, *ācaran paraśākhoktaṃ śākhāraṇḍaḥ sa ucyate*. *yaḥ svaśākhoktam utsr̥jya paraśākhoktam ācaret*, *apramāṇam r̥ṣiṃ kr̥tvā so ’ndhe tamasi majjati*.



Thus (says) Angiras: “A person who wishes to attain well-being should carry out all rites of passage as they are prescribed in his own Gruhyasūtra. One performing these rites otherwise does not attain well-being.”



It is also said in the Gr̥hyakārikā: “Whichever Veda, along with its ancillary texts, is traditionally associated with a person, he should perform rites according to that specific Śākhā, and one should also study that particular Śākhā. After studying

one’s own Śākhā, one may study another Śākhā. One (who studies another Śākhā) abandoning one’s own Śākhā is called ‘traitor to his Śākhā’ \[*śākhāraṇḍa*\]”.



So is the quotation from Vasiṣṭha in Vīramitrodaya: “A person initiated with rites from a particular Śākhā should study that particular Śākhā. Otherwise he becomes a fallen person.”



Vasiṣṭha stipulates a fault in performing rites prescribed in a Śākhā which is not one’s own: “A wise man should never perform rites prescribed in another’s Śākhā. One who performs rites prescribed in another’s Śākhā is called a traitor to one’s own Śākhā. He who abandons rites taught in his own Śākhā and carries out rites taught in another’s Śākhā invalidates his own *ṣi *and sinks into blinding darkness.”



The only concession Rāmakr̥ṣṇa offers is that a person can accept rites prescribed in another Śākhā if they are not described in one’s own Śākhā, and do not contradict one’s own Śākhā.



This, he supports with a quotation from Kātyāyana :

**

*yannāmnātaṃ svaśākhāyāṃ paroktaṃ avirodhi ca*, *vidvadbhis tad anuṣṭheyam agnihotrādikarmavat*.



The rites which are not taught in one’s own Śākhā, and those which are prescribed in another Śākhā and do not contradict one’s own may be carried out by the learned, like the performance of the Agnihotra.



With such strictures, the various Śākhās of the Vedas gradually evolved into *jāti*s, sub-caste communities with distinct social identities, and the relations between them became ever so complex.
