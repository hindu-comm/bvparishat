Let me add a little more to the confusion, or rather, clarification, by supplying one specific information,

which I thought was more or less evident, hence did not choose to cite. Scholars are welcome to draw their own inferences.

  

In the source that I cited, it is *categorically* stated that

***svAdhyAyo'dhyetavyaH*** means *sva-s'AkhA* first, others next.

So, *svadhyAya = sva-s'AkhAdhyAya* first.

  

Studying others, therefore, **to the neglect of one's own** was what was held reprehensible.

It only says then : First things first; **the rest, next.**

There it ends I suppose.

  

Now, the statement is :

*  
*

*manuH -*

*vedah kRtsno'dhigantavyas sarahasyo dvijanmanA //*

*  
*

***rahasyam** upanis"at/*

***adhigantavyo**'dhyetavya ityarthaH/*

*  
*

*tathA ca s'rutiH -*

***svAdhyAyo**'dhyetavyaH - iti/*

*svakula-paramparAgatA s'AkhA*dhyetavyeti yAvat/**

  

  

After about 18 lines, it cites Vasis"Tha again, even more categorically :

  

***adhItya s'AkhAm AtmIyAm para-s'AkhAm tataH paThet.***
