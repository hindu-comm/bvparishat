Coming to the question of Prof. Deshpande, that initiated the thread, the surnames/family names dvivedi, trivedi, chaturvedi etc. may have nothing to with the s'AkhA affiliations of the families with those surnames.



Even if there would have been one person who learnt two, three or four vedas, the title acquired by that person can become the family name.



There is a Telugu speaking family name 'dvivedula'. That does not mean they are affiliated to two different s'AkhAs of veda.
