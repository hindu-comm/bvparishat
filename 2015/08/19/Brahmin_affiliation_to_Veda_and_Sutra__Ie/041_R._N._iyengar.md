The discussion seems to be drifting in various directions. When one talks of authority my understanding is Paddhatis are weaker than Sutras. Hence if we accept Grihya sutras to be at a higher level the choice of how many Vedas to be practiced is left to the person concerned. We read in the Bodhayan Grhya Sutra

The above injunction defines S'rotriya and goes up to R.shi. This seems to encourage one to become a Dwivedi, Trivedi,....... When only one branch of Veda had to be studied, it must have been the hereditary branch as kuladharma.

  

I may be corrected if I am wrong.
