Dear Prof. Deshpande Ji



It is the same family. Janārdana Gaṅgādhara Raṭaṭe was the nephew of Nārāyaṇa Śāstrī Raṭaṭe. Janārdana Raṭaṭe’s magnum opus is the Sanskrit verse translation of Tulasīdāsa’s *Rāmacaritamānasa*, named the *Mānasabhāratī*, published by Bhuvan Vani Trust (Lucknow) in 1981. The work was blessed by none other than Dharmasamrāṭ Karapātra Svāmī, and had praise from the who’s who of Varanasi in 1981 including Paṭṭābhirāma Śāstrī. I have a copy of the work, and as a lover of both Sanskrit and*Rāmacaritamānasa*, I find it a worthy and unparalleled tribute in Sanskrit to Tulasīdāsa’s original work.



Janārdana Gaṅgādhara Raṭaṭe is no more. His son Mādhava Janārdana Raṭaṭe is a professor at the Faculty of Sanskrit Vidya Dharma Vijnan, BHU.



As per the Inventory of Sanskrit Scholars, the family still lives at Durga Ghat, Varanasi. The book also lists the contact details of Mādhava Janārdana Raṭaṭe.

  

Thanks, Nityanand
