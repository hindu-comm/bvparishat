Each Veda has more than one shakha. When the rules about study of one veda apply does it mean study of at particular shakha and its associated ritual texts with which the family of the learner belongs and then move to another shakha and then to another veda. Can a person study a Shakha to which his family doesn't belong to? Can a person study another Veda itself first that his family belong to? Is Veda with its Shakha also fixed by birth or can it be changed as per the learners choice?  
  
Are answers to these questions explicitly stated in any Dharma Shastra or it commentaries. Can scholars please give specific references.
