Since s'AkhA affiliation meant only the allocated/accepted share of responsibility in preserving the Veda by learning to recite it,

  

1\. The rule must be one can learn any number of branches of the Veda provided he learns the branch affiliated to his family lineage first.

  

2. For 'working on' a branch of the Veda, there are no such restrictions. Hence those who used offensive words against Prof. Bhattacharya and his father when they proposed to 'work on' Atharva Veda were wrong. Such comments usually come from personality problems such as jealousy.
