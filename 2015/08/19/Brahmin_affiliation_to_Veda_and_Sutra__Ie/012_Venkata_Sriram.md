Namaste,

  

Whether chaturvedi / trivedi / dwivedi can recite purusha sukta or not is not the issue. Somewhere up above in the hereditary line, a mahAtma studied 4 / 3 / 2 vedas and the name stuck down the line to their descendants. Similarly, the title "somayAji" in telugu smArta families.
A great person in their family might have performed sOmayAga and the title stuck down the line to their descendants. This is something as the saying goes "my grandfather consumed lots of ghee; for evidence come and smell my palm". 

  

There is a greatness associated with these names that inspire awe and reverence for such noble souls who sacrificed their lives for vEda-samrakSaNa and karma-kANDa. 

  

For that matter, the title "sarma" has got a very deep significance but unfortunately, the telugu brahmin families without knowing it's importance put this before their names. The shatapatha brAhmaNa discusses this aspect and says that the vaTu after donning the "kriSNa jeenaM" (the deer skin), pledges that he would protect the vaidika dharma with his anuSTAna.

  

atha kriSNAjInaM AdattE "sharmasi" iti

  

"sharmAsi sharma mE yaccha"

  

The yajna-purusha having left the company of dEvatAs, assumed the form of kriSNa-mriga. The dEvatAs followed that mriga and took the kriSNAjeenaM (the skin). Hence, the yajna-shareera is called "kriSNAjEnaM". The three colours viz., shukla,kriSNa and babhru on the kriSNAjeena represent rg, sAma & yajurvEda. Hence, the kriSNAjInaM represents "vEda-trayi".

  

While taking the "yajna-deeksha", the yajamAni wears this kriSNAjInaM and thus gets protected from the vEda-chandas. Such a vaTu / yajna-dIkSitaH is supposed to be "sarma". 

  

The word "samhita" is also derived from the same meaning "yasmAt ayaM chandObhiH swasharIraM samAhitavAn tasmAt samAdhAnahEtutvAt chandaH pATaH samhitA iti uchyatE"

  

So, such words have deeper meanings but unfortunately the later family members don't know the importance of such lofty secrets behind it. 

  

Unfortunately, we know only such "sOmayAjis" who hang around bars, restaurants and are chain-smokers.

  

No offence meant.

  

regs,

sriram
