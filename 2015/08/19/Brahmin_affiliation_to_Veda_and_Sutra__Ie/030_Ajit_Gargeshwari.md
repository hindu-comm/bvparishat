स्वकीयशाखा the terms usage has to be traced in Dharma Shastra . There are injunctions and details about Veda Adhyana and how much one can learn when can one stop etc. I did not find specific texts in Dharma Sastra or Mimamsa literature which talk about studying ones own shakha and can person study more than one shakha. Its clear in from Dharma Shastra one can study one two or even three Vedas.  
  
The position on Atharvana Veda study is also not clear when Dharma Shastras say one can study One two and three Vedas is Atharvan Veda excluded when the mention Threeor Trayi?  
  
Can a Rig vedin learn atharvana Veda in stead of Rig Veda or is a persons Veda also determined by birth? Is a person affiliated to a veda or to shakha?
