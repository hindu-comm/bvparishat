Thank you Prof. Korada. An option would be as you have suggested श्रुतिस्मृत्योः विरोधे तु श्रुतिरेव गरीयसी but in this context the Shrutis as texts don't say much on स्वकीयशाखा. Grahya Sutras downwards in terms of chronology give varying different and contradicting views as Prof Kannas, Prof Paturi and Prof Iyengars postings have indicated.
