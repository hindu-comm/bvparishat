Dear Nityanand Ji,

  

  If, by chance, you have a pdf of this Sanskrit translation of Tulasiramayan, I would love to have it.

  I still remember the interesting conversation with Mrs. Ratate during our visit to Banaras in 1980. She asked me where I was from. I said I came from Pune, and that my name was Madhav Murlidhar Deshpande.
She told me that there was a Murlidhar Deshpande, a friend of her uncle, who lived in Juni Tapkir Galli in Pune, and whether he was my relation.
Indeed, that was the same as my father. To this, she mentioned that my father, along with her uncle, were involved in arranging her marriage.
It was such a surprising connection that not only made my access to their Sanskrit manuscript easy, we had a dinner invitation from the Ratate family. Sometimes, interesting connections are revealed by pure accident. With best wishes,

  

Madhav Deshpande
