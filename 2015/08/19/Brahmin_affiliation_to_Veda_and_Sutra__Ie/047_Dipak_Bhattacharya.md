Many thanks Professor Korada. I am in full agreement with your assertion ' so the question of restricting one to study the family शाखा does not arise'. In that case our use of terms like Rgvedin, Yajurvedin etc should be just pointers to only later locally developed conventions without any implication of restriction of right or access to other Vedas. But are we not to draw another inference too -- that the hautra, audgaatra or aadhvaryava practice, or even aatharvana pracrtice, is not compulsorily hereditery?
