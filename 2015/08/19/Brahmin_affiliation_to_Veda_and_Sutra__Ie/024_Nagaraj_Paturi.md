Sources ? For what?

  

Dear Prof. Bhattacharya,

  

You said,

  

"I found objection raised against my (and earlier my father’s) **working on** the Atharvaveda. The particular word used by the person, revered by many, when he came to know that I was a Ṛgvedin, was so demeaning that I cannot print it here. But is not this strictness non-Ṥāstric?" (emphasis mine)

  

I said in my recent post :

  

 For '**working on**' a branch of the Veda, there are no such restrictions. Hence those who used offensive words against Prof. Bhattacharya and his father when they proposed to '**work on**' Atharva Veda were wrong. Such comments usually come from personality problems such as jealousy.(emphasis new)  

  

I do not know if you were happy or unhappy with my saying that those who offended you were wrong.

  

Your recent question was:

  

Is there any rule in the Sastras restricting a reciter from reciting any Veda?  

  

My response was:

  

Rule that one can learn any number of branches of the Veda, provided he learns the branch affiliated to his family lineage**first**,

  

is a result of putting together a, b, c & d.

  

Only #(a) among them is connected to book sources as you can see. b and c are ethnographic. d is lexicographic and is obviously a documentation of usages.

  

Which of them do you want me to provide here?

  

Regards,

  

Nagaraj
