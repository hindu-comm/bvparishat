Coming to the question of Prof. Deshpande, that initiated the thread, the surnames/family names dvivedi, trivedi, chaturvedi etc. may have nothing to with the s'AkhA affiliations of the families with those surnames.

  

I agree with the above view. I know many Chaturvedis and dvivedis who don't know to recite any Vedas not even the Purusha Sukta
