Sir

I know a Yajurvedin who learnt Rigveda and Asvalayana because there was only a Rigveda teacher nearby. Nowadays it is difficult to find a kramaantasvaadhyaayin who learnt one Veda. I guess those who have learnt two thoroughly would be very rare. There are two Krishnayajurveda-ghanapaaThins who grace our Vedasabhaa, who seem to know quite a bit of Rigveda but they don't claim to be Rigvedic pundits.

From a Saastric view, all Saakhaas and all Smrtis are authoritative to all (Mimaamsaa: SaakhaantaraadhikaraNam) with the following rules of conflict resolution:

1\. In case of Sruti vs. Smrti, former prevails.  
2. Own Sutra vs. Other Sutra, former prevails.  
3. Other Sutra 1. Vs. Other Sutra 2, one consistent with aacaara prevails

Also, one is supposed to learn all Vedas starting with ones own. So it may be concluded that subject of study does not have a bearing on the custom of ones family.

Regards  
N. Siva Senani
