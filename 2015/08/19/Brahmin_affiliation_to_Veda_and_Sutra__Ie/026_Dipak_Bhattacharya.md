Dear Professor Paturi,  

I had a simple question. The statement 'provided he learns the branch affiliated to his family lineage first,' was the occasion. I just wanted to know where the concept of a Vedic ;saakhaa affiliated to one's family lineage occurs in the Sastras. I am sorry if I have not been clear in my expression of the query or if I unknowingly became the cause of any different and wrong impression. I offer unqualified apology if such an impression has been created. But the query was absolutely inoffensive.  

I hope that query is clear. I shall be gratified to know the answer.  

Best  

DB.
