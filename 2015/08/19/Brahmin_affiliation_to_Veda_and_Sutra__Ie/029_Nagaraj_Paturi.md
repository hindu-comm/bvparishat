Veda-recitation is older than the event through which Vedavyasa classified the Vedas.Whichever is the evidence for classifying the Vedas into śākhas is the evidence for s'ākha affiliations of Brahmins too, since to imagine Veda separated from its reciter is not possible. In fact, it can be said that Vyasa classified the reciters by informing them to which śākhā the mantras they had been reciting belonged.Sośākhā affiliations of the Veda-reciting families can be said to be older than the classification of the Vedas. But that affiliation can be said to be just informal, the reciters not knowing
to which śākhā their repertoire of mantras belonged. Nevertheless, they had been reciting only a certain group of mantras as handed down to them from their forefathers. Vyasa did not disturb this informal, unconsciousshare-'allocation' or share-acceptance in the preservation of the huge repertoire oforal tradition. Hejust formalizedthe sharing by informing the reciters what they had been reciting is to be called as per the principles enshrined in the Vedas itself. The sharing then became conscious, organized, reinforced and thus better established.



How else can the classification of a material preserved only in the oral recitation tradition be done?



In folk-narrative-performing communities, for example, a certain community as a wholehas a huge repertoire of narratives and narrativesongs. But each family within the community has certain number of thosenarratives and narrative songs in which it specializes. The family itself may not know thatall the narratives and the narrative songs in which they specialize belong to a certain category of narratives. A folklorist, ethnologist ora cultural anthropologistafter studying the whole community may come up with an observation that some of the families are specializing in heroic ballads, some others in village goddess narratives, some others in deified women narratives, some others in fairy tale narratives and so on. These specializationscould continueeven if the artists are not informed about this organization among themselves that existed without heir knowledge. As a researcher engaged in such studies professionally I can tell you that a feedback from research to the performer about such facts always reinforced the organization of specializations.
