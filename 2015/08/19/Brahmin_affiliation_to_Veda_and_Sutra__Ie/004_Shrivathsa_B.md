hariH OM,

I think you are referring to the word 'shaakhaaraNDa'. I heard this word for the first time about two years ago. I wasn't careful enough to ask the scholar who used the word for the reference thereof.

The position that there may not have been strict shaakhaa entities and gotras such as Rgvedin, vishvaamitra etc. cannot be sustained because  
1. Veda has usages such as udgaataa, hotaa, adhvaryu etc.  
2. in yaj\~na there are certain rituals which pertain to particular Vedas and also particular gotras. (e.g. soma lataa can be bought only from a braahmaNa of kutsa gotra. There should be some justification for this in Veda, else it wouldn't have been so in yaj\~na).  
3. Many instances in the Veda which say that the descendants of a particular gotra did so and so etc.

svasti,  
 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,  
 shrivathsa.
