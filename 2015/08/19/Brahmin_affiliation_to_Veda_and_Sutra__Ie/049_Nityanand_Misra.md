Dear Dr. Bhattacharjya

  

I have heard this narrative and some similar ones but to the best of my knowledge, this is not found in any authentic historical or Purāṇic source. Panḍita Rājanārāyaṇa Śāstrī (whose work *Sarayūpārīṇa Brāhmaṇa Vaṃśāvalī* I cited earlier) discusses this narrative and dismisses it as *kapolakalpita*.

  

More can be discussed in a new thread.

  

Thanks, Nityanand
