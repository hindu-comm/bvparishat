Dear Venkat Sriram,  

I did not ask for you preaching please don't make uncalled remarks. I don't think you have contributed anything substantial to the questions raised. Thanks for letting me know that Chaturveds Dvivedis Trivedis donot know" deeper meanings but unfortunately the later family members don't know the importance of such lofty secrets behind it" and you got divine revelations about the the great inner significance associated with Sir including Sarma which is just a common Sir name used all over India.  
  

No offense meant
