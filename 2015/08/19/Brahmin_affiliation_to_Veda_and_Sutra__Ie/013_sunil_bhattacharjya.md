Namaste,  
  

In the Vedic rituals the Atharva priest (the Brahma-priest) had the exalted status that he supervised the performance of the rituals by the Rig, Yajur and the Sama priests, and that should mean that the Atharva-priest was the expert on the rituals of Chaturveda. It could be that this exalted status was accorded to the Atharva priests by the time of the Mahabharata, by which time the Atharva veda not only achieved parity with the Veda-trayee, even the kings were advised to appoint the Atharvavedin priest only. Whether the Atharvavedin priests had the surname (family-name) of Chaturvedi or not, there must have indeed been Chaturvedi brahmins in the past.
