Finally , I think that we can arrive at a conclusion that - one should first learn स्वशाखा and if he can - may learn other शाखाs also .






-------------- Prof. Korada



Vasis"Tha further says, and this very relevant here :

  

***adhItya s'AkhAm AtmIyAm para-s'AkhAm tataH paThet//***

***  
***


---------- Prof. Kannan



With regard to learning to recite too, how would it have been possible for persons learning more than one Veda if there would have been prohibitionon a person belonging to one s'AkhA fromlearning another one ?



The rule is, to my knowledge that one can learn to recite any other branch after learning one's own.






------------ Nagaraj very early in the thread.



There seems to be a consensus in this regard.
