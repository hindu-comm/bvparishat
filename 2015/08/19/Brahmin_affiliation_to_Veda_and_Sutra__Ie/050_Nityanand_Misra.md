Dear Prof. Deshpande Ji

  

Here are some more details of the book. The *Mānasabhāratī*is a facing page Sanskrit verse translation of the*Rāmacaritamānasa*which runs into 700+ pages and covers all the \~11,000 verses of the epic. I am attaching a sample page of the book from the *Sundarakāṇda*along with a photograph of the poet Janārdana Gaṅgādhara Raṭaṭe (also from the book). The book has praise from*praśasti*s by Baṭukanātha Śāstrī Khiste, Revāprasāda Dvivedī, Karapātra Svāmī, Janārdana Datta Śukla, Viśvanātha Bhaṭṭācārya, and N. Paṭṭābhirāma Śāstrī. The book costs INR 400 to buy in India, and 35 USD to buy on[Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Ramacharitmanas-Translated-into-Sanskrit/dp/B00N7RCOTS).

  

I do not have a PDF of the book, and it is still copyrighted. Moreover, the publishers who own the copyright have been neighbours of my paternal family for the last three generations in Lucknow. However, I can have a copy of the book sent to you. I will write to you off the list for the same.
