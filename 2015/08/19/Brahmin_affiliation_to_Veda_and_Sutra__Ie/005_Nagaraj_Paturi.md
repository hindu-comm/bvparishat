\>I found objection raised against my (and earlier my father’s) working on the Atharvaveda.



"working on " is different from learning to recite.



There is no rule restricting anyone from "working on " any of the four Vedas.



With regard to learning to recite too, how would it have been possible for persons learning more than one Veda if there would have been prohibitionon a person belonging to one s'AkhA fromlearning another one ?



The rule is, to my knowledge that one can learn to recite any other branch after learning one's own.



One whodoes not learn his own s'AkhA and tries to learn another s'AkhA could have been treated as 'not loyal to' 'infidel to' his own s'AkhA.
