Rule that one can learn any number of branches of the Veda, provided he learns the branch affiliated to his family lineage **first**,

  

is a result of putting together

  

a\. Purana evidencs for allocation of branches of vedas to Brahmin lineages

  

b\. Current memory of families about the branch allocated to them

  

c\. Numerous evidences of a single veda pundit knowing to recite more than one Veda

  

d\. attempt to identify the rationale behind the notion of s'AkhAraNDa

  

and resolving the relation between a, b, c and d without mutual conflict.
