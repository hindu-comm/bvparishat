Dear Nityanandaji,  
  

I came across a story (but do not have any reference with me at this time) that the Sarayupariya brahmins alone agreed to help Lord Ram to perform a sacrifice to atone for the killing of Ravana, who was a brahmin and a great vedic scholar, and for this reason the other brahmins shunned them. Then those brahmins moved to one side of the Sarayau river and settled thereand hence earned that name. Are you aware of any such story and the associated details?  
  

Regards,  

Sunil KB
