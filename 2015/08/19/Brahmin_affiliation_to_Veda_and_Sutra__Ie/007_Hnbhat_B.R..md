I remember this point had been discussed earlier in this group. I could not remember the exact title of the topic enough to enable the search.

As Nagaraj has replied the learning of one's own शाखा is mandatory though it does neither prohibit nor prescribe learning another शाखा than his own as the sentence of तैत्तिरीयोपनिषत् lays down is generally applicable to learning Veda-s

सत्यं वद। घर्मं चर।*स्वाध्यायान्‌ मा* प्रमदः।

Though there is no reference to any thing to specific to any Veda or Yajus Taittiriya for that matter, the adjectives स्व one's own makes it specific to the शाखा of Veda one belongs if any prescribed. The question is about the source restriction and related to one's family or Gotra are prescribed. It is customary to state one's शाखा, गोत्र, प्रवर etc. during अभिवादन during Sandhyavandana daily. The question is where this relation between these is prescribed mandatory restricting their relation.
