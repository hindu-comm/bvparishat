Dear Nityanand Ji,

  

  I don't know the current members of the Ratate family. I visited Banaras around 1980 in search of manuscripts of the Śaunakīyā Caturādhyāyikā, and at that time met Pandit Narayan Shastri Ratate at his home on Durga Ghat. As an aside, it turned out that his wife was from Pune, and that my father was involved in arranging her marriage.
Pandit Ratate allowed me to make a photocopy of the manuscript he had in his collection, and I used it, along with 20 other manuscripts, in the preparation of my edition of this text.

  In any case, this whole discussion has been very informative, and I want to thank everyone who contributed to it. With best wishes,
