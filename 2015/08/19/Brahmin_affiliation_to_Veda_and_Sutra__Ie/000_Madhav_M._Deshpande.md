Dear Colleagues,

  

  We know that each Brahmin is affiliated traditionally with a particular Veda/Shakha and a particular Sūtra. However, what is the ritual affiliation for those Brahmins who are traditionally called Dvivedi, Trivedi and Chaturvedi? Do they have concurrent multiple Vedic/Sutra affiliations? I was told by the Ratate family in Banaras that their personal Vedic affiliation is with Ṛgveda, and yet academically/professionally they became Atharvavedins. I am wondering if the situation with Dvivedis, Trivedis and Chaturvedis is similar, in the sense that they academically study two, three or four Vedas, and yet have a particular one Veda as their family affiliation. Any information, including textual references, would be helpful. With best wishes,
