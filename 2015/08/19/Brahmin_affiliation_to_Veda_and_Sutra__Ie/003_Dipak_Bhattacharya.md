At present, affiliation to a particular Veda is something immutable. But this position could not be very old. Is there any relevant rule in the late Vedic scripture or the Dharmaṥāstras on that? One finds gotra rules of endogamy and exogamy (Baudhāyana) but none about Vedic affiliation. It must have been later that the situation gained a static position. I found objection raised against my (and earlier my father’s) working on the Atharvaveda. The particular word used by the person, revered by many, when he came to know that I was a Ṛgvedin, was so demeaning that I cannot print it here. But is not this strictness non-Ṥāstric? As far as I know there is no Ṥāstric entity as Ṛgvedin or Sāmavedin or Yajurvedin.

It is not impossible that Dayānand Sarasvati knew the position of the Ṥāstras in this regard. He changed his object in Vedic study and was not quite vocal about his Vedic affiliation. He was in agreement with the scriptures in that. 

If my idea is not correct someone may kindly point out.
