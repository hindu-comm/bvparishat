I think the above is the correct explanation. Firstly end-names likedvivedi, trivedi, chaturvedi do not appear in Vedic texts. The counting of the learnt Vedas as 2, 3 and 4 indicates that the default was 1 which was the rule and exceptions arose later.

Geographically the above surnames are prevalent in UP, Gujarat, MP,... north of Vindhyas. I remember to have read in a historical novel by name : Banabhatta's Autobiography (Original Hindi by HP Dwivedi. I read the Kannada translation) that King Harsha during his coronation as Emperor gave away titles which included Dwivedi, Trivedi etc ( or may be Trivaarii-> Tiwari? Writing from memory E& O.E !). The first attested appearance of such names as Brahmins is seen in the Khajuraho inscription (10th Cent.) of the Chandellas. Hence my feeling is the three special surnames are part of social history of the classical period rather than of the Vedic times which is still retained at the most basic level in the gotra, sutra and S'aakha.
