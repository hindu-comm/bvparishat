Namaste,  
  

It is not about study of a particular Veda alone, the rituals and the Sanskara-vidhis also have to conform generally to the ways of the particular veda. For example, we are yajurvedins and we follow mostly the yajurvedic ways for the rituals, with some rituals being performed by the tantric ways and probably with an option to adopt a few of the ways of the Rigvedins.  
  

As regards the studying the different Vedas I understand that the restrictions are not unsurmountable, provided one can get the right teacher/ Vedic school for the same.  
  

Regards,
