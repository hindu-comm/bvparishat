The author just started learning Sanskrit, so these things may be ignored.

  

Usually Livemint, controlled by Wall Street Journal, has a distinct bias against traditional beliefs, practices etc. of India. So whenever they mention Sanskrit or scriptures, there is a hint of derision. However, on this occasion, they seem to be making a valid point.
