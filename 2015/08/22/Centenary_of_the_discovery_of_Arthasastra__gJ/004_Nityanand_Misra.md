We must appreciate the fact the author is after all an[engineer and an IIM graduate](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sidin), and *ipso facto* is not expected to know that [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Karpuragauram_Karunavtaaram&oldid=674349623)can be unreliable due to rogue edits like [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Karpuragauram_Karunavtaaram&type=revision&diff=487301952&oldid=486509187). The hapless IIM graduates should be allowed factual errors, after all they are used to focus on the big picture and not bother about irrelevant details like orthography, grammar, accuracy, citations, etc. Having sailed in the same boat, Sivasenani Ji and I can completely sympathize with the author.
