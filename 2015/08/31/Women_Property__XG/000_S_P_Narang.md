Following the doctrine of equality before law in present context, both brothers and sisters inherit the property which generally does not reach sisiters. I give here a slogan

sisters: You become more soft than a petal if brother is needy

But harsher than a thuderbold if he is greedy

Claim your share in any situation. Do not be exploited.
