Dear Sri Ranjendran Sir,  
  

I thoroughly enjoyed reading some of your papers and they are lucid, scholarly, objective, honest, inquisitive and have an unfailing positive feel of loving the legacy of Sanskrit backed by lot of reason and research, which many of the so called English literate "Sanskritists" are lacking with. Thanks a lot for this vidvat-samaaraadhanaM.  
  

With warm regards  
  

ganesh
