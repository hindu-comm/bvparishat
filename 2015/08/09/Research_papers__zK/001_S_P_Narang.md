Thanks spnaang

  

Ph.D. classes





Dear Sir/

I took a few classes for Ph.D. at Rashtriya sanskrit Sansthan. It was a wonderful experience. Our students of M.Phil,Ph.D.and UGC do not fine an opportunity to intensive and advanced methodology due to lack of tutuion support. I hereby propose to deliver a few lectures at your institution. It does not require any finance for remuneration , TA etc. because financially I am sound. I may provide TEA to students as well. the only thing I require is a room to sit and teach for the lectures on the subject above. If interested consult your colleagues, students and all the recipients. Let me know after consultations. Take your time. It may be electronically supported by my sanskrit data Bank both orally and printed-points. It is in the interest of the students and not for me. Regards, spnarang
