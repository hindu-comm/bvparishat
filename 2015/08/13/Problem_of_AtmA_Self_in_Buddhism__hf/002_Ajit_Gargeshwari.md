Prof. Reigle should first define what does he mean by "Genuinely Buddhist Attitude". Is it Buddhism as expounded in the edited texts of Pali or its Sanskrit version or Buddhism as represented in Tibet China or Ceylon or words of Buddha himself. The Buddhas words itself is not an undisputed fact among the redactors of the canon. This is an established fact as know by the various councils they had in the early days when they decided to codify their canons. Once that is clearly understood one can adopt a 'Genuinely Buddhist attitude' which I suppose Prof. Reigle has adopted in his writings and publications.

Buddha or in the writings of the Buddha as we know Buddha himself doesn't define nirvana it can be interpreted in many as per different schools. Hence the various commentators say what they understood as to what buddha said.
