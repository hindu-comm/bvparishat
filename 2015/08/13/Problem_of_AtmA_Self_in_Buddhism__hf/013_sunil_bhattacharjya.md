You mean leading to different levels of truth?  
  
Shunya as taught in the Sanskrit texts of Mahayana is not nothingness and Nagarjuna specifically emphasized on this. So also the Vishnusahasranama says that one name of the Lord is Shunya. However, to my knowledge, Shunya points to nothingness only in Pali. Any comment?
