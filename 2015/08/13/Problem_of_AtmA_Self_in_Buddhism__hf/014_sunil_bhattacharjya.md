Namaste,  
  

The first promulgation in Sarnath was on the four Noble Truths including the Eight-fold path. The second promulgation in the Vulture peak was on the Mahayana teachings. The third at a later was on the Tantric teachings. These were the different levels of teachings during the time of the Lord. It is only much later after Lord Buddha passed away that the newer sects appeared stemming from the these three original promulgations.
