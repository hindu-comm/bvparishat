AdarNiya visvadjan,

  

The ‘renowned’ Theravada materialist Nyanatiloka has said:...*"Thus with this doctrine of no-Self-less-ness, or anatta, stands or falls the ENTIRE structure of Buddhism".*Buddhism in general and Theravada in particular,preachesNo-Soul theory.**It is interesting to note that a careful search of nikAyAs gives a long list of hot passages to support the *contrary*, which the Theravadins do not want even to get them
translated, for fear of what massive implications they would have upon their heretical Abhidhamma view of annihilationism. It must be kept in mind that nikAyAs pre-date, ie. composed long before the Theravada came in to existence, To examine we must focus on what Lord Buddha himself said and not "what he ought have said", as put forward by the later commentators. The results which need to be studied and examined properly to see the fallacy, if any, prevailing for last two thousand years.**

  

Hope this may help some one interested in the issue.

Regards

Sati Shanakar
