Namaste,  
  

To my understanding Kamaleshwar Bhattacharya is saying that the Atman in both Hinduism and Buddhism mean the Supreme Self. The individual self in Buddhism is Anatta and it suffers during the cycle of birth and death but not the Atman. Kumaraswamy's book also shows that the concept of Atman in the Buddhist texts do not basically differ from that in the Hindu texts.
