"Such a pattern we find in our own Indian Philosophy also, where
generalised statements are made in academics which makes study of Veda not so important and suggests to begin with Upanishad while studying Bharatiya darshana, leaving the reader with no genuinely grounded and that, I think let to many diversions and so called systems."  
  

Vedas have been studied in academic circles. A complete knowledge of Vedas the portions preceding the Upanishads may not be needed to learn or study Upanishads and Vedanta Philosophy.  
  

Each system or Darsana is complete and an end by itself one can choose any system depending on ones inclination. Different views always exists if they don't how will any knowledge progress?  

  

"So far as search of secondary sources is concerned, I apply what Lord Buddha said, quoted in my document upon myself."  
  

That is what what I said its not clear to scholars or to Buddhists themselves as to what were the original teachings of the Buddha. Scholars depending on their judgement say these were the words of Buddha. The Buddhist canon it self has been rendered to a type of secondary literature and no one clearly knows What Buddha said.

  
  
"This led Dr. Coomaraswamy to say:"On the one hand, the professional scholar, who has direct access to the sources, function in isolation; on the other, the amateur propagandist of Indian thought disseminates mistaken notions. Between the two, no provision is made for the educated man of good will."  
  

Who is to be blamed for this the amateur or Professional Scholar
