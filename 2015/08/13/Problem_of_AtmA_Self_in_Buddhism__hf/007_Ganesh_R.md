Dear Prof. Sati Shankar ji,  
  

Thanks a lot for the wonderful paper of yours and me too, based on my own studies often and often has felt that the Buddha is not an anaatmavaadin as he has been presented by the Buddhists.  

I just wanted a help from you and will be grateful to you if it could be done easily. I need a dEvanaagari version of the citations you have made as it is difficult to read the transliteration, that too with out the diacritical marks. Unless, a closer study of the original citations are made, it would be difficult for me to understand the interpretations of either sides.  
Hope this request will not trouble you much.  
  

With deep regards  
  

ganesh
