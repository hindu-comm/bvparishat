Namaste!

  

Buddha appears as an incarnation of Divine Consciousness and Force whose purpose of manifestation was to lift the humanity from the then mechanical and rigid *kārmic* rites, rituals & sacrifices of *Brāhmanic* cult to a pure spiritual state of love, Truth and Righteousness, which was established by the Aryans, the goal of their life. It may be noted that all incarnations of “Divine manifests as human way, take up human action and uses human methods with the human consciousness in front and Divine behind” (Letters on Yoga, Sri Aurobindo).



Buddha’s three different teachings at 3 different places certainly based on his gradual higher spiritual realizations.



The first teaching is the experience of the Vedic formula of Right, Truth and Vast (satyam, rtam, brhat), the path of Truth (rtasya pantha) to attain eternal bliss, a path to pass from ignorance, falsehood and death to Wisdom, Truth and Immortality and experience of the state of Sachidananda/Asat.



The Second one is the spiritual experience of the Bhagavad Gita (Karma-Yogi/Enlightened one has to perform his duty in this world/Bodhisattvahood)



The third teaching is based on the experience of the Cosmic Consciousness, the Vedantic Para-Brahman, which often described as inexpressible by the Upanisads.
