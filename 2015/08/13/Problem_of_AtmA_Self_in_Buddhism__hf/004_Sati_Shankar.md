Sir,

My search proceeded just under curiosity on why so strict adhereing by Theravadins, whereas Mahaparinirvana Sutta has enough and without taking such a hardline. That is why Buddhists consider Mahaparinirvana Sutta a time bomb which will explode some day....

So far as search of secondary sources is concerned, I apply what Lord Buddha said, quoted in my document upon myself.

I came to know Mr Bhattacharys through this thread and found recent blogpost, I am giving below:

We understand that the conception gas so deeply grounded and there complete sophistry has been adopted while writing the Abhidhamma that it is easy to say it "impossible"

but if we do abide with the Master, there is no other way tio revert back to his own words, ...

  

Such a pattern we find in our own Indian Philosophy also, where
generalised statements are made in academics which makes study of Veda not so important and suggests to begin with Upanishad while studying Bharatiya darshana, leaving the reader with no genuinely grounded and that, I think let to many diversions and so called systems.

  

This led Dr. Coomaraswamy to say:"On the one hand, the professional scholar, who has direct access to the sources, function in isolation; on the other, the amateur propagandist of Indian thought disseminates mistaken notions. Between the two, no provision is made for the educated man of good will.”.

Sati Shankar
