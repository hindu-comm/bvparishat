Dear Sir,

Thanks for your interest. So far as reference in devnAgari is concerned, you know we have become slaves of computers, they are slaves of logic and the language they are administered in.

We can find many sources on www where we can read search concordance of any word in Vedas and subsequesnt literature, this is not so easy for Buddhist literature, especially Pali, so fas as I know. Paly text society does not allow free search...

  

So far as references in devnAgary is concerned, There are two possibilities.

\(1\) We use diacritical concerter which will convert romanised Pali given in reference in devnAgari OR

\(2\) More productive will be if you download Complete Tripitika in devnAgari and romanised and Pali is available for free at <http://www.tipitaka.org>.

  

Even if individual references are converted in devnAgari, ultimately you will be needing original reference, so it is better to have a copy of Tipitaka on your desktop and look for individual reference as when needed for study and writing.

  

Hope this will solve your problem.

Best Wishes

Regards

Sati Shankar
