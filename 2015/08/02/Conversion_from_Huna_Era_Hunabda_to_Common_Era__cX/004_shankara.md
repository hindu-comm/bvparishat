Sir,

  

You are right. Thank you very much for pointing out the discrepancy.  

  

I was, in fact, trying to identify the year of publication of 'Guruvamsamahakavya' which is given as 1970 Hunabda. Now, as I checked the concluding verse of the book, I found the year of composition is given as चन्द्राङ्कदिक्छशिमिते शके i.e. 1891 Saka, which is either 1969 or 1970 CE.

  

It seems, the publishers had used the word 'Hunabda' as if it is identical with Chrisitan or Common Era.  

  

Attaching the title page and last page of the book.



regards  
shankara
