if 448 CE or 456CE was the beginning of Hun Era when could 1970 Hun year take place? In terms of Christian Era it must be 1970+448/256 = 2418CE/2226 CE . Either of these has not yet passed.

It was approximately the rule time of the popular Hun Attila and cannot be the beginning of Hun Era. Even after Attila another popular Hun King was Mihirakula who lived till 542AD. These two cannot be the Epoch Makers of Huns.

We have to go back still.

I have been trying to work out on this. If I get success I shall post.

Warm regards,
