Dear Vishal Ji! Namaste!

Those lessons are designed in such a way that they are so easily posted on mobile phones they are meant for mobile phone environment.

More over if you want to learn through other means depending on your learning stage i.e. beginner or advanced learner, you can find gurus in your locality. If you want learn Sanskrit through any other means there are a good number of books and audio-video CDs etc published by Samskrita Bharati. You can obtain them learn. Even online research oriented teaching packages are developed by Samskrita Bharati. You can try from such sources to obtain the necessary material for learning.

  

My intention in informing you all is to merely share my experience of using WHATSAPP also as a means of Sanskrit propagation and not to become an online Sanskrit teacher of even scholars.

  

Warm regards,

**Dr. Rani Sadasiva Murty**
