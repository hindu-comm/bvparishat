Namaste. Very good effort indeed. My compliments.Using technology in the service of Sanskrit is most laudable. Dr. K.Varalakshmi bhagini of Sanskrit Academy, Hyderabad; has been doing pioneering work in this field for quite some time now including the use of WhatsApp, Skype,eBooks, ppt lessons in Paninian grammar, animated pictures etc. Blogs,webinars and tweets are on their way.

If all scholars who think out of the box can join together, new sanskrit related pedagogies can emerge as a result of their effort.
