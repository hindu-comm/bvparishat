Namaste,  
  
A good idea Dr.Murthy Garu. However, eye specialists are advising us not to use whatsapp and other chatting softwares excessively.  
  
I used to be a member in whatsapp group elsewhere for samskruta bhasha.
I was an ethusiastic participant. But, by reading the messages / discussions / online participation, my eyes are straining and I had to spend sleepless nights owing to severe eye strain. Constant itching sensation, dullness in sight etc. were my problems. My doctor asked me to stop reading messages in whatsapp.  
  
Recently, my friend's wife also had similar problem. She was very active in facebook, twitter, whatsapp. This addiction lead to dullness of brain and now she is being treated by a psychiatrist.  
  
All these are good so long as one is not not addicted to these social networking. However, whatsapp addiction is creating havoc by taking toll of the health which is leading to eye problems and neurotic disorders.  
  
In my opinion, whatsapp is not the right platform of learning shastra.  
  
regs,  
sriram
