Once again I take chance to explain a little bit more about why I said this. Yes. We are all aware of what is going on around us. There are many experts among us rendering wonderful service for the propagation of Sanskrit through their incessant efforts in all possible ways using the modern technology.

  

Soon I posted this mail this morning I have received some phone calls and some messages too to include them all as the students in the Whatsapp groups.  All the day I have been answering their calls till now.

  

 This, in fact, not expecting any students to join in my Whatsapp groups, is posted here. All are well experienced scholars in this group.

  

There can be many means to use for propagating Sanskrit learning. But in Whatsapp there is some ease and convenience. It is a mobile app. Mobile is very close companion of all in all times now a days. So if we include the people in Whatsapp group and post Sanskrit lessons in an enjoyable manner they can read, enjoy and enrich their knowledge even while they are in bus/train journey. So instead of spending their time in listening to time-pass entertainment audios and videos they will pay attention to learn Sanskrit even while moving or even while waiting in airports. Its impact and influence will be there over others also.

  

In all the groups I develop I concentrate on including top rank Government Officials and those who can influence others to learn Sanskrit.

  

In Skype and other means this facility is not there as they need a computer/laptop to be carried with them which is an extra burden.

  

Hence I shared my experience with whatsapp with you all with a view that similar efforts can be started by others also in the areas of Vedanta and other Sastras.

The efforts of those who have already begun are always well honored with much respect.

Warm regards,
