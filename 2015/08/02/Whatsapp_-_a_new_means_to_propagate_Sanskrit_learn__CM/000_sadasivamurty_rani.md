I am happy to share my experience with you all regarding the new means I found useful in propagating Sanskrit learning.

  

All of you know the "Whatsapp" facility in smart phones particularly with 3G Sim. Through whatsapp I have developed certain groups by names SAHRDAYA SIKHSA, MAIMT RSVP etc. Through these groups every day I am posting lessons on Sanskrit Language and Principles of Sanskrit Literary Criticism. I have started these groups almost six months ago. I am successful in imparting sufficient knowledge to the enthusiasts in Sanskrit learning through document files, audio files and even video files.

  

In this process while uploading large sized audio and video files I have learnt some methods of compressing the data to match the mobile requirements and uploading.

This is found good and very much useful in teaching Sanskrit learning.

We can develop this kind of Whats app groups for teaching Vedanta, Vyakarana and all other Disciplines of Knowledge.

In each Whatsapp group we can accommodate 100 members.

I wish others too can start on these lines.

  

Further to add I am using local TV channels also for propagating the ancient teachings among the public.

1. Through City Cable of Tirupati I have been delivering lectures everyday on

1. Bhagavadgita 2. Srivenkateswara Vaibhavam and 2. Dharmasandeham (All these three together under the title : VYASAPITHAM)

2. A National Channel has requested me to start a serial programme named "BALASIKSHA". To teach the children lessons on our Indian Culture and Sanskrit trhough Stotras. Once the programme is started I shall again upload the details.

For the appreciation of the learned members of Vidvatparishat I am attaching a few photos of my City Cable Discourses.

Warm regards,
