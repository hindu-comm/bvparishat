There has to be some way for a person to present his credentials

.

 M.M. N.S. Ramanuja Tatacharya has several titles to his credit. He has written extensively. Either a person writes books or publishes papers

.

How else can one know a persons scholarship. Any one during a job interview or promotion has to show his credentials either in terms of papers or books. Is Dr. Prasad suggesting we do away with Examinations and evaluation process and simply judge a person in an interview by a one one interview which can be subjective approach. UGC has evolved an objective approach whats wrong with it?

 

Please note no promotion can be given automatically one has to earn them.  All process can be improved there are no second thoughts.

  
  

The problem with most Indian university is they hardly do any research as they are burdened with too much teaching and administrative work which takes all their time. Acute shortage of faculty at all levels is a big problem Exception are there many ans Indian University scholars do publish quite a lot. They do that because they can find time and do a lot of sacrifice not all can or will be ready to do it. Lets also accept the fact all are not equally talented or every faculty who joins a university is cut out for research.  
  

We have deviated quite a bit from the subject of the thread. Let the discussions continue
