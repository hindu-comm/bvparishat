Dear Vishal ji,  

  
I am not saying there are no exception but for majority of us, yoga is viewed as exercises to keep one fit mentally as well as physically. Please don't mix yoga philosophy with popular yoga practices being done in India and all over the world. As you have seen Pizza outlets mushrooming all over Indian cities one has seen yoga centers too.  
  
One would need to live yoga is it practiced by any? One needs to live advaita or dvaita? So until you become a realized saint may be in this life or in a million life will one give up all formal education? Are you suggesting all of us become recluses?  

  

The way we ordinary mortals live itself in a way can be said to be a yogic way of living. Lets leave the practical part to sadhus there plenty of them doing a good job or not I don't know
