Then how do you want the promotion system be? Do away with publishing of research and make promotions based students feed back how good a teacher is? If one has quality intake one can expect quality out put. When intake is based on reservation how can output be proportionate?

Even in days when formal certificates as we have to day was not given there used to evaluation and recommendation methods to judge a persons scholarship. Many a good scholars where left out then and even now.

There has to be way a way to measure either marks grade different evaluation methods like continuous assessment or some accepted model.

Yes I have left it our Honorable Prime Minister to decide who should head premier research institutes in this country assisted by our HRD minister they knows more than us or me. Due to our peculiar system of reservation we have the wrong people sitting in the right places in many institutions  
  
With our first hand experience we have we hardly do any writing. China has over taken India in terms of the number of articles they publish in international journals

Main stream researches are done at universities or institutes where it should be done. NGOs contribute to research by guiding PhD students and take post graduate and graduate level classes? I don't think so Where is teaching and research separated? Who has heard of a professor who doesn't want to teach? A full time researcher is given less teaching hours per week. Since we have a shortage of faculty we end up teaching more and researching less that is what I meant

  
  

If you allow only NGOs or industries to do research how can theoretical research or basic fundamental research be done whose impact will be felt decades later
