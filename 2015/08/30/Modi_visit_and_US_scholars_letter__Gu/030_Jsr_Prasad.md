A medical doctor thoroughly dissected the dead moralities of the hypocrite academicians, to find out any genetic abnormalities. Why faculty of Pakistan origin have joined the so-called Indian diaspora, in the signature campaign? I wonder, are some of the faculty of Indian origin ever heard of the saying - 'जननी जन्मभूमिश्च स्वर्गादपि गरीयसी'? If the answer is no, then one should assume that they must have digested the saying of Shankara - 'उदरनिमित्तं बहुकृतवेषः ।' Thanks to Dr. Aseem Shukla for his brave stand, and also to you for bringing this to the notice of the forum.
