We should also consult Sadhus and traditional scholars to judge whether people like Hajime Nakamura and George Cardona should be considered scholars of Buddhist/Vedanta and grammar philosophies respectively. Never mind their stellar credentials and large bodies of work, till we have a judgement passed by Sadhus or traditional Vidvans who actually practise and live the Buddhist/Vedanta/grammar philosophy, we should refer to them as so-called or self-proclaimed or university-trained scholars. And universities should stop at PhD in Indian philosophy, post-doctoral degrees in Indian philosophy should be awarded in resolutions passed by only Sadhus and traditional Vidvans.  

  

(Just to clarify, I am being sarcastic)

  

A degree from a top university and good publications (books or papers in peer-reviewed journals) are seen world over as strong credentials. They show that a person has proved his/her intellectual abilities on well-established standards. Critical evaluations of somebody’s works is welcome, but discounting university degrees and publications in today’s world is anachronistic.

  

PS: Vishal Agarwal has three university degrees, one from India and two from the US
