Thanks Dr. Prasad, This is the type of response that is needed to counter what Shatavadhani Ganesh Ji calls the *formal riding over the substantial*. There are academicians in the Western world who have a staunch leftist view, and in some cases, a political agenda. There is a need to counter their actions (like this petition) and writings, and it is these type of responses that are effective. Camille Bulcke’s *Ramkatha: Utpatti Aur Vikas*made many arguments which were against the traditional Indian view of the *Ramayana*. It was countered by Swami Karpatri’s*Ramayana Mimamsa*, a phenomenal work. Similarly, Vishal Agrawal’s chapter-wise response (I do not know if it is published as a book yet) to Doniger’s book*The Hindus: An Alternative History* is another example where the the substantial responded to the formal very substantially.

  

In my opinion, *ad hominem* responses like “Doniger/Witzel are not scholars” or sweeping generalizations like “publishing papers/books and getting university degrees mean nothing” do not help our cause. It is a fact that university and journal standards in the Western world are much higher than those in India: if we deny this, we are not living in the present age. Saying that a PhD from Harvard or MIT is not a scholar is very easy, but defending a PhD dissertation at Harvard or MIT (in any subject) is certainly not easy. Saying that publishing papers/books means nothing and I laugh at/feel pity on those who cite their publications is very easy, but actually publishing a book with a reliable publisher (OUP, MLBD, Springer, etc) or a paper in a peer-reviewed international journal (Elsevier Science, IEEE transactions, etc) is certainly not easy: it takes originality as well as strong reasoning to convince the publisher or the anonymous subject matter expert of the merit of the work. This is not to say that there is no plagiarism in Western academia, it does exist. But unless plagiarism is proved, a PhD from a top university or book/journal publications speak a lot about the intellectual abilities of an author. While academic credentials and publications are not the only criteria of judging scholarship,they are very much the top criteria in judging scholarship today.
