Dear R. Ganesh Sir,  
  

Please let me join you all to second the expressed views. There used to be a great Telugu vidwaan (apologies, could not recall his name), who was in government teaching service. He wrote some good Telugu books. He supposed to get his next level career promotion, for which he needs to attend an exam. When he looked at the question paper, he has to answer questions based on one of his published books! Probably he was not aware that he has to attend the exam to answer questions from his own book. So, at times, examinations and certificates become mere formalities.  
  

Acclaimed scientist, Dr. C.N.R. Rao has about 1500+ papers to his credit, but they may be mostly joint research papers. Sometime ago, I stumbled upon a paper in internet, which was co-authored by 398 scholars! As opined by Sri Hari Parshad Das, publishing numerous papers would not merely qualify one's scholarship. Prof. Stephen Phillips sat with great M.M. N.S. Ramanuja Tatacharya (no need to introduce), to bring out English translations on [Tattvacintamani](http://www.amazon.in/Books-N-S-Ramanuja-Tatacharya/s?ie=UTF8&page=1&rh=n%3A976389031%2Cp_27%3AN.S.%20Ramanuja%20Tatacharya). We revere Prof. Tatacharya ji not by his published papers. Perhaps, scholars may add more such scholarly names.  
  
However, it become mandatory to publish, to get next level of promotion for teachers as imposed by UGC. One need to acquire more number of APIs to grow otherwise digest the American saying - 'publish or perish'. Journals mushroomed like anything after UGC's decision. So, there comes the tussle between quality and quantity. Here is one interesting story where a person has created a [peer review mafia](http://www.naturalnews.com/046192_peer_review_fraud_scientific_journals.html#) ring. There should not be any such parameters, as per modern nomenclature, to measure the scholarship. Hope, I did not go off the track.  
  

Regards  

Prasad
