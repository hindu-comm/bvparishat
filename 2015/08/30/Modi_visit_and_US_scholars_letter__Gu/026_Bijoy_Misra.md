Friends,  
  
Research to extend knowledge is a necessity for scholarly survival.  

Repeating old stories in better dresses may not qualify as research.  

In this forum, Dr Sunil Bhattacharya's paper seems like a revelation  

to me. I hope many have followed and looked into the evidence  

presented by him. Rote descriptive knowledge does not do much.  

It is something the west imposed on Indian education system and  

must be abandoned as quickly as possible.  
  

Best regards,  

BM
