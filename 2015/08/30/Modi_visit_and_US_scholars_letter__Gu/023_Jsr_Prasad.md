Ajit ji, I did not mean so as you interpret. Please read my phrasing \<However, it become mandatory to publish, to get next level of promotion for teachers as imposed by UGC. One need to acquire more number of APIs to grow otherwise digest the American saying - 'publish or perish'. **Journals mushroomed like anything after UGC's decision**.> The emphasis was on mushroomed journals which do not maintain quality, but not on UGC's decision. Indeed, it is an excellent idea to asses the individual performance.

I have a bad memory. But I can quote a few more names of traditional scholars later.

I meant to say, examinations are not only the parameter, nothing beyond that! How can I forget śalākāparīkṣā kind of ancient examinations. But I guess, there was/is no such pass mark as 30/35. Imagine the kind of treatment a medical practitioner does, graduated with 40% marks.

You may better leave this thing to us, as we have first hand experiences.

I highly appreciate your comments. but why focus is only on University system. University faculty are not only the saviours, there are several other institutions, including NGOs who equally contribute to teaching and research. By the way, one can not separate research from teaching as you cannot separate science from philosophy, they are integral. Teaching is an art, when it is translated, it becomes research.
