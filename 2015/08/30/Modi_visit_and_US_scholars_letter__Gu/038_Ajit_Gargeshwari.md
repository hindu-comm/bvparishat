One more point I wish to add to the view" yoga is practical unlike its other counterparts" all Indian philosophy is practical in nature has moksha as its end. Lets one not be under the impression that only yoga system is practical and other systems are not. Now have we discussed Modi's speech? if no more views are welcome.
