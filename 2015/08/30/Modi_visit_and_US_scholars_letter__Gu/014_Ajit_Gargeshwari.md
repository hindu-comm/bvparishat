I agree with this view expressed by Hari Prashad Das Ji,  
  
"No doubt publishing papers and getting university degrees helps a person in gaining knowledge, but it is not the only method of gaining it, and most of the vidvanas of the bygone centuries are a testimony to this fact. There are these so called "scholars" in the west who are allergic to learning Sanskrit in the traditional way. On the other hand we also have some so called traditional vidvanas who reject anything and everything coming from the west. I sincerely pray that God gives them the ability to understand the logic of 'the dead horse and the burnt chariot' given in the Mahabhashya."  
  
  

Let knowledge come from all sides should be our motto. East and west both have positives as well as negatives aren't there head strong and arrogant scholars in India there are many. Instead of complaining about Witzel and Pollock whose writings should not matter to us the right approach would be to counter them in terms of writing scholarly papers and books and make western audience read them. We have to many loud mouths with very little action.
