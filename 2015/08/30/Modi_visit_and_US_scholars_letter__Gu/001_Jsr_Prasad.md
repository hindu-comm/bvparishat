Good to know that the mother of controversies, spearheading the agitation, along with her 'adopted children.' Also good to know that not only the federal government of US, but the citizens too are committing to moral policing. If such is the case, then it does not make sense of conducting annual summits in the name of G8, UN General Assembly etc., where we represent ourselves.  
  

Thanks
