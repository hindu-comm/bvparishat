Now let meas Har Prasda ji a question should do we do away with degree systems? Should we stop quating from Journal publications? and have apublic poll on the worth of a work I don't think so. What public perceives need not be be the truth. If academicians should not judge a persons work who should do it ? Can I judge the worth of research that done in the area of Biology and medical sciences  
  
"I said that I laugh and feel pity at those who consider it a sole criteria for proclaiming their superiority. I am repeating my message here again"  
  

Then what should be criteria I repeat my question? Should public debate be the criteria Should arguments by the process of quibble and point to point refutation by non experts be the criteria?
