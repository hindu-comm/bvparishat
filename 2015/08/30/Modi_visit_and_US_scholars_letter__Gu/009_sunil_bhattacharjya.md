It is well-known that Michael is arrogant and hostile. He was furious when he heard of my paper on "Dotted record", which is related to ancient Indian history.  He stated that he would reply to each and every sentence of that paper once he reads that, but so far he has failed to refute a single sentence. Yet I do not think his Sanskrit knowledge is bad.
