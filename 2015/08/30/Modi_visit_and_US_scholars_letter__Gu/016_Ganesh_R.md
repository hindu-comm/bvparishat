Dear Sirs,

I completely agree with the views of sarva-Sri. Hariprasad das, Ajit Gargeshwari and AshOk Aklujkar. This is the real need of the day as the formal is ruthlessly riding over the substantial. This reminds me the witty statement of abhinavagupta-paadaH "dEvaM vikreeya yaatrOtsavamakaarSheet! "

Regards

Ganesh
