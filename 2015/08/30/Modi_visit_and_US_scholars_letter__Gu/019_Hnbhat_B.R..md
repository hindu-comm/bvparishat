I like the statement न हि सर्वः सर्वं जानाति and the English counterpart Know something about everything and know everything about something.

It is practically impossible to know everything about everything in the world.

I am reminded of this statement reading the different views expressed about Sanskrit Scholars in this thread. Not all Scholars needed to present and published papers and books nor all the traditional Indian Scholars are able to give वाक्यार्थ in सदस् in all the शास्त्र-s other than the one they have had training.
