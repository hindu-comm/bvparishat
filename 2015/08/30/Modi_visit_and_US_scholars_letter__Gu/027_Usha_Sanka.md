I think the point

 raised

here was not exactly

about 

their



academic



Samskrt



scholarship, or their amount of research papers

 or not having them-- as it is later discussed in the thread

.

Question is

about their real understanding capacity



of संस्कृत-वाङ्मयम्.

For example these statements of Wendy Doniger may be considered--

  

---------------------

The Bhagavad Gita is not as nice a book as some Americans  

think . . . Throughout the Mahabharata . . . Krishna goads

human beings into all sorts of murderous and self-destructive

behaviors such as war . . . The Gita is a dishonest book; it

justifies war.

--Wendy Doniger, in Philadelphia Inquirer

  

There is generally, therefore, an inverse ratio between the worship

of goddesses and the granting of rights to human women. Nor

are the goddesses by and large compassionate; they are generally

a pretty bloodthirsty lot. Goddesses are not the solution.

--Wendy Doniger, in Washington Post

------------------

  

Do these seem like a good scholar of Samskrt speaking?
