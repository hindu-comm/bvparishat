Thanks Vidwan Nityanand ji. Majority of the signed are NRI faculty. It is amazing to know that foreign scholars were denied entry to participate in conferences in India, as the petition says. Also, they are seriously interested in current political scenario in India, being academicians! Seemingly, it is nothing but a political game to demoralize, in which learned academicians are the pawns. Academic scholarship need not be politicized. I found one Sanskrit scholar in the list.  
  
*\<Under Mr Modiâ€™s tenure as Prime Minister, *academic freedom is also at risk*: **foreign scholars have been denied entry to India to attend international conferences**, there has been interference with the governance of top Indian universities and academic institutions such as the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, the Indian Institutes of Technology and Nalanda University; as well as underqualified or incompetent key appointmentsmade to the Indian Council of Historical Research, the Film and Television Institute of India, and the National Book Trust. A proposed bill to bring the Indian Institutes of Management under direct control of government is also worrisome. **These alarming trends require that we, as educators, remain vigilant not only about modes of e-governance in India but about the political future of the country.**\>*
