Namaste,  
  
*महाजनो येन गताः स पन्थाः.* Yes this is important.  
  
After the Varna system came into being (albeit by mutual consent) in the Treta yuga, as the Ramayana says, it is obvious that the "' Birds of the same feather flock together" must have taken place and the shudra groups/societies as well as the vaishya groups/societies started forming, as separate from the other two varnas.

Another interesting observation of Lord Buddha is important as he showed that birth of a person in a particular family / varna was not just accidental. It has to do with one's past karma. Lord Buddha did not allow an untouchable girl to marry Ananda saying the girl in her past birth refused to marry Ananda as she was a princess and was proud of her higher staus. Because of that Karma she took birth in a lower status and Ananda would not be able to marry her.
