I read the story many years ago and do not have the details of the reference, ready at this time. A low caste boy wanted to marry a high caste girl but the later refused to marry the former. In their later birth the boy was reborn as Ananda a high born associate of Lord Buddha. Ananda met a girl near a water well and they were attracted to each other. This girl was Pakati, who in her previous birth rejected Ananda, a boy of low-birth in that birth. Pakati fell in love with Ananda andwanted to marry Ananda. Ananda sought the permisssion of lord Buddha and the lord refused. Lord Buddha told Anand to bring the girl to him and at that time the lord told her the story of her past birth and her action in that birth, which led to her present low birth. Then the girl was allowed to become a bhikshuni and that is the end of the love-story. The abridged (also sanitized) form of the story is given in the url :
