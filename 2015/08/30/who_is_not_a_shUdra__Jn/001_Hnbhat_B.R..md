The simple question who made the वर्ण-s as in the present society to be applied by birth and whence the derogatory words ब्रह्मबन्धु and ब्राह्मणब्रुवः came into prevalence? There is no equivalent words क्षत्रियब्रुव or क्षत्रबन्धु. But I have seen क्षत्रियापुत्र used.

What about वर्णसंकर mentioned in Gita as

अधर्माभिभवात्कृष्ण प्रदुष्यन्ति कुलस्त्रियः ।  
*स्त्रीषु दुष्टासु*वार्ष्णेय जायते वर्णसंकरः ॥१-४१॥

and also detailed by Manu as संकरजाति in the society.

By birth every one becomes जन्तु and nothing more to name any वर्ण either by गुण or कर्म as शूद्र or ब्राह्मण as according to Vedanta सर्वं खल्विदं ब्रह्म everything in this world is ब्रह्म nothing particular for human being, all the animate or inanimate s are related to ब्रह्म. So also the त्रैगण्य is the nature of every creation and not particular to human beings. Krishna himself ordered the society with गुणकर्मबिभाग. After Krishna created, who governed this standard to every one born as human beings? Only Guna is explicit when a child grows and Sankhya Guna is common with animate and inanimate creation in this world. Who then divides the कर्म, when a child grows up belonging to a specific वर्ण and assigns the कर्म? The षोडशसंस्कार like "अध्ययनमध्यापनं यज्ञो याजनं दानं प्रतिग्रहणं दायाद्यं सिलोञ्छः । (आप. धर्मसू.2.20.4)

  

1.1.19 वसन्ते ब्राह्मणमुपनयीत, ग्रीष्मे राजन्यं, शरदि वैश्यं, गर्भाष्टमेषु ब्राह्मणं, गर्भैकादशेषु राजन्यं, गर्भाद्वादशेषु वैश्यम्।।

इति आपस्तम्बः। will be meaningless, as before eight years, the गुण-s could not be decided and thereby ब्राह्मण as per guna-s, could not be fixed before the year of Eight at least and the later स्वधर्म also meaningless without any standard applicable for the classification in the Society at the time of आपस्तम्ब.

In my opinion, all the quotations cited are context sensual and I agree with this old statement in Mahabharata after reading many discussions on this topic in this and many other pages:  

वेदाः विभिन्नाः स्मृतयो विभिन्ना नैको मुनिर्यस्य वचः(मतं) प्रमाणम्!  
**धर्मस्य तत्वं निहितं*गुहायां महाजनो येन गताः स पन्थाः!!*
