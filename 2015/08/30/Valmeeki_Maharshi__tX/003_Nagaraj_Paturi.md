There is a Telugu kavya composed in 17th century by the Tanjore king Raghunathanayakudu on Valmiki's biography with the title Valmiki charitramu.



Researchers have mentioned that the version of the narrative in this book is close to the one in 'Dharmakhandamu'.



In 17th century itself, Dharmakhandamu itself was composed in Telugu and got published in 1931.



Any clues about Dharmakhandam in Sanskrit or any other language ? Thanks in advance for any pointers.
