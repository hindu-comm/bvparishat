Internal matters of Religious Charitable Institution including Gita press are not within the scope of BVP mailing list is my opinion. Many Religious institutions have many internal and external problems do we need to discuss them on this list.  

You are mistaken if you are comparing Gita press with Harvard University or Calcutta University or Hind Benaras University. Gita press as I have said before is not a University.  

Please now don't be under the impression that I am in any way belittling the great services they have rendered  

I hope they resolve their problems and are back to publishing the books they publish
