But Ajitji, the scholars have a stake in this. It is like closing a Sanskrit Department in a University because of budget.  

While the latter is a larger issue, a scholar is a part of a family.
Valmiki won't exist if some nameless person had not scribed!  

As part of the scholarly duties, we must salute those scribes, who never gained recognition for their invaluable contributions!  

If I have a choice, I would side with the Gita Press workers. I think they are among the best in the country!  

I agree it is not a scholarly discussion, but a scholar cannot insulate oneself to the happenings in the society.  

All scholarly writings are directed to solve problems in the society.  

So, is my opinion.  

Best regards,
