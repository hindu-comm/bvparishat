Dear BVP friends,  
Apparently there is labor dispute. What I learned from the Zee news report that the employees  

are grossly underpaid. If the parent company does have resources, as they claim, they should  

compensate the employees for decent living expense. The Gita Press books have been among the  

most well produced books in Hindi and Sanskrit in India. The employees deserve our gratitude  

and appreciation from the Trustees.  

There should be public or Government mediators to set the salary for the employees respecting  

the market rate, skills and experience. The book editors and typesetters are as good as the  
calligraphers who have helped preserve the scriptures and the tradition. The scholars should have  
a say in this by expressing opinion, compliments and counsel.  

Personally I have benefited immensely from the books published by the Gita Press and would  

like to help whichever way I can.  

Best regards,  

Bijoy Misra
