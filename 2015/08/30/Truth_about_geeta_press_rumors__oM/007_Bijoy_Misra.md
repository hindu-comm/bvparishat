Ajitji,  

We are not discussing the finance of the institution.  

We are discussing the treatment of people in the institution as alleged  

by the employees who work there. Health of an institution is not built  
on finance alone. Times are changing where revision of service salaries  

becomes a requirement. I agree that we cannot help except being sympathetic.  

On an academic side, revision of clerical salaries at Harvard was not  
easy. It did lead to strikes and show downs twenty years ago.  

Hope India would show more alertness and compassion.  

Best regards,  

BM
