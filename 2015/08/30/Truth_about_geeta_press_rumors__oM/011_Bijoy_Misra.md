Ajitji,  

My humble opinion is that the modern scholars should be as cognizant of the present as  

to the literature of the yore. All (past) creative work must have been produced to address  
problems in the society. I agree that the problem could be one of many which operate  

on archaic hierarchical rules. We have to maintain the tradition but build a more equitable  

society as envisaged in the scriptures.  

Best regards,
