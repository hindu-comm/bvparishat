Further, विपदमियं doesn't fit in the sentence syntactically making the meaning blurred.

को विन्ते विपदम् is alright. But where does इयं in the feminine pronoun in the sentence relates? There is no corresponding noun in feminine nominative relates. If it is to be related to the विपदम् as कर्म of विन्ते it should be in द्वितीया was इमाम् it means this danger. And in the case of विगतं पदम् विपदम, or विशिष्टं पदम् विपदम्, meaning this specific post indicating the writer is lamenting his lost post, it should have been इदं in the neuter gender in Concordance with the कर्म of the verb as पद is in neuter gender.

Any other explanation interested to justify this anomaly repeated in each verse?

Anyhow the interest in composing poetry is appreciated. Care should be taken also to avoid mistakes in the matter of gender Concordance.
