Dear Professor Pandurangi,

  

  I have discussed this question at length in the introductions to my edition of the Śaunakīya Caturādhyāyikā (HOS Vol 52, 1997) and edition of Recitational Permutations of the Śaunakīya Atharvaveda (also HOS Vol 61, 2002). I am unable to send pdfs of these books. However, you should be able to find the full discussion of this question by S.P. Pandit himself in the introduction to the first volume of his edition of the Śaunakīya Atharvaveda. The Pandit edition was later reprinted by Vishvabandhu from Hoshiarpur, and this reprint edition also includes Pandit's original introductions. The Pandit edition of the AV may be available from DLI or at one of the local libraries in Bangalore. With best wishes,

  

Madhav Deshpande
