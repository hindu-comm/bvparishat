thank you Prof. Paturi and Shrivathsa ji. I pray that whatever little grantha-sevā i can perform may bring pleasure to the great personalities who wrote these granthas and to the vidvāns who read them and may all of them shower their blessings on me so that I can come closer to my iṣṭa-devas.  
  

sādhu-caraṇa-rajo 'bhilāṣī,  
  

hari pārṣada dāsa..
