Now, when the whole discussion about 'plagiarism' has become the buzz on related academic forums and certain general online forums alike, one of the talks among Indians is 'how about all the knowledge the west took from us?' While some of such thoughts are based on rumors and unsubstantiated story creations, gossip and folklore about how all modern science is from the Vedas and Sanskrit books that traveled to the west during colonial days, in the case of some ideas of modern science or modern academic studies, the west's indebtedness to the east in general and India in particular can not be brushed aside. In fact, some of these links are acknowledged by the western scholars too.

  

But still there are quite a few ideas that make part of modern knowledge claimed by some as taken from the ancient/traditional Indian sources, but the claims repeatedly rejected by the western and some Indian scholars.

  

Some ideas are found earlier in Indian sources than in the western sources. The same idea being in ancient Indian and modern western sources in some cases be just a coincidence.

  

But in some cases direct link between the ancient Indian sources and modern individuals to whom the discovery or invention is credited seems not to be unfounded. Such 'influences', 'inspirations' and other such links are not yet acknowledged or accepted. I think it is the historians of ideas that have been fighting such lack of acknowledgements and their readers that are now adding 'how about this then?' kind of statements into the current plagiarism buzz.

  

One such issue that comes to my mind is the link between the similarity of ideas of Ferdinand De Saussure with those on ancient Indian linguistics and his being a teacher of Sanskrit among other languages.

  

Other members of the list may remember more such debated and not yet debated instances of idea-connections between the ancient Indian sources and the modern or western knowledge.

defines not acknowledging the source of ideas too as plagiarism.
