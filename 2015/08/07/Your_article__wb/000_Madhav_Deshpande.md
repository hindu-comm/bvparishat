Dear Professor Narang,

  

  If you have a pdf of photo snaps of your article on"Dialect of Sialkot in Pāṇini", please send them to me. My university library does have the volume "Studies in Indology", but I am currently away from campus. Would appreciate if you can send me a pdf or photos. With best regards,
