Dear friends,  
  

While looking at the Chaturvarna, we have to keep in mind what the Ramayana (Ramayanam Vedasamam) says about it. There were only two varnas (the Brahmanas and the Kshatriyas) in the beginning (i.e., in the Satya yuga) . In the Treta yuga the Kshatriyas started doing tapasya and they achieved parity with the brahmanas. Then the people decided unanimously
that there should be four varnas and according to that the Vaishyas and the shudras were not entitled to do the tapasya in the Treta yuga. Obviously at that time this division was based on Guna and Karma, as Lord Krishna told us In the later yugas the restrictions were gradually relaxed and the Shudras were entitled to tapasya in the Kali yuga . This could mean that the all the Varnas could enjoy the same privileges in the Kali yuga.  
  

Regards,
