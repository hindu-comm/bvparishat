Namaste Prof. Paturiji,  
  

The Mahabharata indicates that the Vedic verses are best understood with the help of puaranas and itihasas and the Ramayana, which claims itself
to be Vedasama, also comes under itihasa. That is why it appears to me that what Ramayana says about the varnas should be more appropriate here than what the so-called pramanika commentaries state.
