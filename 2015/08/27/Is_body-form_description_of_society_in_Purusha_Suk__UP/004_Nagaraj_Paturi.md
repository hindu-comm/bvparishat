\>The superiority of brahmanas and the inferiority of śūdras can also be seen in various Vedanta commentaries (Shankara bhashya, Sri Bhashya etc.) and some places even in comparatively recent literature like Rāmacaritamānasa e.g. this following quote from the Araṇya-kāṇḍa (translation by Pandit Ramnaresh Tripathi)



--------- The point in my post was not that hierarchical view of Varnas is not there anywhere.



The point was that the quoted mantra does not have it.



This point has the following implications:



1\. The hierarchical view of Varnas that does exist among people's minds is not rooted in the mantra being discussed.



2\. If at all mantra is to be followed as a guidance, it can only lead to view of varnas asequi-status parts of an organic whole.



Vedanta commentaries belong to Vedanta only. Vedantic perspective need not be the general perspective to be followed by all. Vedanta prioritizes moksha and its value-hierarchy is moksha-centred. Bhagavatapurana is an upabrimhaNa of Vedanta. Hence it has a moksha based value hierarchy.



Beauty of Vedic worldview itself is its not being monolithic, its openness to co-existence of multiple perspectives.



Mantra under discussion here need not necessarily be viewed only from a Vedantic perspective.



That evenaccording to Vedanta, samadars'ana towards shunichaiva asya paake cha is considered to be a great achievement is a different matter.
