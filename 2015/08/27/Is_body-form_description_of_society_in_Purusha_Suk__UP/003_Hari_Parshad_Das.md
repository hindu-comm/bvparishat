I am simply giving an alternate point of view here and this may not necessarily be my point of view.  
  
There are two separate questions here:  
  
(a) Are the feet of ordinary people at a comparatively lower level than the rest of their body parts?  
  
(b) Are the feet of Lord Vishnu (the purusha) at a comparatively lower level than the rest of his body parts?  
  
The answer to (a) is yes and it is seen in the general practices of Hindu culture. Generally, one does not touch anything sacred with one's feet in Hindu culture. Shoes are not allowed inside temples. Here is a śruti quote from an unknown source:

The answer to (b) is 'no' because all his body parts are generally given equal respect by devotees. This can be seen in the various praises that devotees offer to his various body parts without discrimination. Sometimes a particular person may prefer meditating on a particular body part, but in general all his body parts are considered equally worshipable.

My thought in this regard is that the social aspect gained focus due to the fact that guNas are associated with these various limbs. For example, the Śrīmad-bhāgavatam (11.5.2) says,  
  

मुखबाहूरुपादेभ्यः पुरुषस्याश्रमैः सह  
चत्वारो जज्ञिरे वर्णा गुणैर्विप्रादयः पृथक्  

  
Shrila Shridhar Swami's Commentary on this verse: भगवतः सकाशाद्वर्णाश्रमाणामुत्पत्तिम् आह — मुखेति । गुणैः सत्त्वेन विप्रः सत्त्वरजोभ्यां क्षत्रियः रजस्तमोभ्यां वैश्यः तमसा शूद्र इति \|  
  
Thus, the general understanding that lower guNas are associated with the śūdras is what is the cause of hierarchy in my opinion.  
  

The superiority of brahmanas and the inferiority of śūdras can also be seen in various Vedanta commentaries (Shankara bhashya, Sri Bhashya etc.) and some places even in comparatively recent literature like Rāmacaritamānasa e.g. this following quote from the Araṇya-kāṇḍa (translation by Pandit Ramnaresh Tripathi):

True, and the bhagavatam verse quoted above also emphasizes the same vibhakti for all.
