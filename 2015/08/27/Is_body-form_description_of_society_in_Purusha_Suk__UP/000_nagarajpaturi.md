The mantra



ब्राह्मणोऽस्य मुखमासीद्बाहू राजन्यः कृतः \|

ऊरू तदस्य यद्वैश्यः पद्भ्याँ शूद्रो अजायत \|\|११\|\|



which is part of Purusha sukta,is interpreted by some as a 'hierarchical' description of the four Varnas.



I always fail to understand how they can manage to see hierarchy in this description.



1\. Is it all centred around



पद्भ्याँ शूद्रो अजायत ?

If this is the whole crux, then the idea seems to be either that in the vertical order in the body, feet are at a lower level, so this is hierarchy, or that feet have a value connotation of 'low', 'less respectable', so this hierarchy.

But is this argument justified?

In the same sukta, there is

नाभ्या आसीदन्तरिक्षँ शीर्ष्णो द्यौः समवर्तत \|

पद्भ्यां भूमिर्दिशः श्रोत्रात्तथा लोकाँऽकल्पयन् \|\|१३\|\|



Does पद्भ्यां भूमिर्दिशः also have a hierarchical value connotation?



In the puranic world, Gangaa is called vishNupadasambhavaa. Is there a value connotation of hierarchy here?



2. Is there a hierarchy connotation in Head vis-a-vis Shoulders vis-a-vis Thighs also, apart from their vertical high to low positioning?

Body part descriptions are there in the Sukta in relation to many other cosmic entities too. Are they all hierarchically viewed? If no, then why this argument be limited only for the socirty aspect?



3. Though Vibhaktis are different for first three quarters and the fourth quarter, the meaning has to be taken consistently and uniformly for all the four quarters of the mantra. So in all the four quarters, it means that four varNas are depicted as forming equi-status components of an organic entity.



4. Hierarchy is not there in sAyaNabhAshya too.
