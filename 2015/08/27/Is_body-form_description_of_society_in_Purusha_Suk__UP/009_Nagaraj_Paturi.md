Namaste aadaraNIya Bhattachryaji, you are entitled to your view of what is relevant here.



Those who consider that the interpretation of a specific mantra is the focus of the thread may or may not appreciate that view.



I for one, would stick to the focus of the thread.



Thanks for sharing your views .



Regards,



Nagaraj
