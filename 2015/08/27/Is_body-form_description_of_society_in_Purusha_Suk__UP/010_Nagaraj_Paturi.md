Dr JSR Prasad, in a separate threadrightly reminded us all about the 'body parts strike over stomach' story.



He said:"On a lighter note, I just recall the 'body parts strike over stomach' story, if prominence to hierarchy is demanded"



Yes, this is an excellent argument.



This is a beautiful example to show that body parts way of looking at different sections of society implies a view of different sections of society as components of an organic whole with an organic unity among themselves.



Thanks Dr Prasad for reminding.
