Dear Prof. Bhattacharya,  
  

Is any pdf copy of the same is available? I understand that the Bengal school was very strong in Navyanyaya and fully matched the Mithila school. My forefathers were originally from Shantipur (till the beginning of the 18th century) and that place was probably the hub of Navyanyaya in Bengal.  
  

Regards,
