Dear Friends,

Happy to inform that the 3-Day Seminar was successful. Not only students (Science, Arts, Engineering) but also teachers, working professionals and general public listened to the speakers carefully and participated in the discussions. It goes without saying that there is wide spread interest in traditional knowledge systems of India. Several aspects of the vast subject could not be covered this time. However, what could be covered in 3-days proved to be interesting to the delegates. I am attaching the abstracts of the talks (except for one!). This may be of interest to some of the members here. If a few Ph.D students get new ideas for their research work from the work reported, I consider my labours to be rewarded. I am also sharing the PPT file I used for my talk. Constructive comments are welcome.

best regards

RN Iyengar
