Dear Mrinal,

  

  I have attached two pdfs, one a Sanskrit edition of Bhagavadajjuka and another of an English translation of the same. When I was a student at the Fergusson College in Pune during the period of 1962-66, we had staged this drama. It was a lot of fun. Professor M. G. Dhadphale from Pune has published a modernized version of this drama. Best,
