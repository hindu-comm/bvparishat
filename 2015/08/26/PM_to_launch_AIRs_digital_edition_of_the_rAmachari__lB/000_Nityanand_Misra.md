NEW DELHI: A special "digital" version of epic 'Ramcharitmanas' prepared by All India Radio (AIR) will be released by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on August 31.  
  
Official sources said that the recordings of Goswami Tulsidas' work, sung by leading singers of Bhopal 'gharana', have been done by the AIR over several years and are regularly broadcast especially in the hindi heartland.  
  
With the launch of the digital version of 'Ramcharitmanas' the broadcaster feels that it would reach not just domestic audiences but those abroad.  
  
It is part of AIR's attempts to go digital in a big way so that the public broadcaster can reach audiences globally, officials said.  
  
"We have been actively taking steps to go digital so that international audiences particularly the diaspora can listen to us," DG AIR F Sheheryar said.  
  
Several of the AIR's channels are available on mobile apps and the broadcaster is also actively gaining more presence on the internet, officials said.
