Kapila has explained in his way his views of life and the goal of life in his Tattvasamasa which is a later composition and Sankhya Karika of Ishvara Krishna gives analysis of the concepts and has explicitly explained in Karikas while Kapila's work is in Sutra style. Both have commentaries by popular commentators. The सांख्यतत्वकौमुदी by the expert in all six systems of Indian Philosophy.

Each system aims at goal for the life and the systems developed their own theories for explaining the goals of life and the means to achieve the goal.

Sankhya and Yoga share many concepts in common, while differing in certain aspects. These are shared by Vedanta Systems too.
