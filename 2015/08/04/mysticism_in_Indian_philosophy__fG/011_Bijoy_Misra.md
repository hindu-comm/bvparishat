I will check, but they probably repeat the purana stories.  
  

The points of relevance to me are:  
  

1. unbounded universe: this could be a Jaina thought that each object is independent  

  of the other. So there is no mutuality to bind. I want to check a scholar's analysis.  
  

2. similarity of objects: each object is similar to the other in its existence; in the cosmic  

  process there is no quality difference. This may be a later thought where the role of  

  the human being is trivialized. This is an important milestone.  
  

3. self-creation: creation of objects need not be tied to the observed physical forces  

  in the universe. "will power" can create. I want to study the rationale.  
  

4. artificiality of time: there is no point origin. The universe operates in a cycle. the  

  local time is relative.  Objects recycle till they extinguish.
Buddhists talk about it.  

  I want to check a scholarly source.  
  

Thank you all for responding and helping.  
  

Best regards,
