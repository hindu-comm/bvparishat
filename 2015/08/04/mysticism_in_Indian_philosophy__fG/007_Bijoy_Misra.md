Dear Dr Bhat,  

It's all useful, but they are not analysis. I want to check if anyone analyzed why life would not have  

an end, why time has to be continuous, why each object in the universe must have association with  

other object, and finally why the universe would not have a boundary.
It has to be pure conceptual.  
I think.Kapila might have done, but we don't have his writings. The writer of the Gita possibly studied  

it. I have to locate the source if I can.  

Best regards,  

BM
