IThe bhuvanakosha is differently explained in different Purana-s differently, if you mean the description found in Bhagavath Purana. The are almost similar but never identical. They are discussed in detail in a book

*पुराणपर्यालोचनम्*. लेखकः श्रीकृष्णमणित्रिपाठी ; सम्पादकः विश्वनाथपाण्डेयः. （चौखम्बा सुरभारती ग्रन्थमाला, 1）. चौखम्बा सुरभारती प्रकाशन, 1993-. 2. संस्करण. गवेषणात्मको भागः; समीक्षात्मको भागः

For the cosmology by way of creation of the Universe, the different systems follow another pattern sharing some features in common and it is section dealt with the Indian System of Philosophy like Indian Philosophy by Dr. Radhakrishnan, a general compendium for the students of Indian Philosophy and the like by Prof.Hiriyanna "The Essentials of Indian Philosophy". The first compares with Western Philosophy frequently,if u mean such an analysis.

As already suggested by Prof. Nagaraj, there should be many more recent research publications on this topic as explained by him. The process of creation is also explained in Bhagavath in a certain order not different from Vedanta system.
