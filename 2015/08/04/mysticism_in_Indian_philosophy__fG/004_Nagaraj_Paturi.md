I always wanted to take a clarification from you about the meaning in which you use the word cosmology.



The following is from one of the dictionaries. All other books too give more or less the same meaning.



> 
> > 1.the branch of philosophy dealing with the origin and general > structure of the universe, with its parts, elements, and laws, and > especially with such of its characteristics as space, time, causality, > and freedom. >
> 
> > 
> > 2. >
> 
> > 
> > the branch of astronomy that deals with the general structure and > evolution of the universe. >
> 



If this is the meaning in which you use the word, a very big bibliography of modern time written books on Hindu cosmology can be found.



A very big number is downloadable too.
