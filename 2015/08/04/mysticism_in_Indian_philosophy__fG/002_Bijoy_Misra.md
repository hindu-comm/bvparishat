Dear Nagarajji,  

I am looking if anyone has done a comprehensive review.  

Possibly brhadArayaka upanisad could be a basis.  

But a book like "Analysis of cosmological principles from Indian philosophy"  

or something on such line is what I am looking. May be a modern day thesis?  

Best regards,  

BM
