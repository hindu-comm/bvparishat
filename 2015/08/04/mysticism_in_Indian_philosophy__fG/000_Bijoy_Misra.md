Dear friends,  

For some years, I have been involved to create a textbook of social studies  

on India for the High School children. In highlighting Indian philosophy, I do  

observe the distinction it carries through its conceptual emphasis on the  

limitations of our physical knowledge. My question is if anyone has analyzed  

this process from a cosmological perspective? I know that statements exist,  

but I would like a philosophical analysis. Please help. You may suggest Jaina  
or Buddhist literature if they can help.  

Thank you.  

Bijoy Misra
