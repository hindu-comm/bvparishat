In highlighting Indian philosophy, I do  
observe the distinction it carries through its conceptual emphasis on the  
limitations of our physical knowledge.



Though I am not confident of my understanding of this sentence, let me see if the following helps:



1\. The pramANa analysis and the discussions on the limitations of Pratyaksha could be helpful.



2\. Vais'Eshika dars'ana uses adrishTam for the causenot explained through its sutra-set.



3.vAkyas such as **पादोस्य विश्वा भूतानि** त्रिपादस्यामृतम् दिवि from the Veda mantras themselves can be quoted and explained.



4\. Upanishads have statements such as yatO vAchA nivartantE, words such as amEya etc.



5\. Swami Vivekananda among modern thinkers has made analysis of this in different lectures and writings of him.
