I will procure Dr Iyengar's reference. Let me read.  

Regarding Nagarajji's probe, I need analysis on time, eternity,  

manifestation and foundational logic.  
The concept of multiple universes, various manifestations of life  

and lack of boundedness is of interest to me. I believe quantitative  
modeling of such concepts can be tried in our schools and could appeal  

to our students.  

I am aware of the descriptive cosmology of Srimadbhagavatam.
