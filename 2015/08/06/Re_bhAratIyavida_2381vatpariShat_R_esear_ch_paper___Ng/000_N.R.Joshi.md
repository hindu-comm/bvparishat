Dear Prof. Bijoy Mishra,



Yiu attended WSC and presented your paper. You did not tell us reactions of other scholars in WSC to your thoughts. Could you please let us know about it ? Since you used Sphota in your paper, was there any discussion on Sphotavaada in papers of other scholars. What papers on Linguistics of Sanskrit appealed to you the most? What new idea you came across in papers of WSC?



In WSC there will always be papers on Puranas, Vedas, Kaavyaas, Manuscripts etc.



You are professor of Physics. So I am interested in your reaction to linguistics, semantics of Sanskrit. Please let us know. We are eager to learn from your experience of WSC. Thanks. N.R.Joshi
