Dear Dr Joshi,  

I had given my impressions in a note earlier. It's not fair to discuss papers before they are published.  

I had two papers with three co-authors. One was on the neuroscience of Rasa and the other was on  

the origin of language. Please feel free to discuss if you like. I would try to answer to the best of my  
ability.  

Best regards,  

BM
