Abhivadayee,

  

This is about a vacant position for a Sanskrit teacher at Purnapramati.

  

Purnapramati is an alternate school, that integrates traditional and contemporary fields of knowledge and delivers this knowledge - to both teachers and children - in an integrated method. The 'Center for Integrated Learning' is different in many ways: multi-age classrooms, a variety of electives, personal interactions with eminent people from different walks of life, a multi-level 'examination', not to grade the child, but to ensure learning.

  

If you are a lover of Sanskrit, are inquisitive about other streams of knowledge, and of teaching methods and are committed to cultivating a love of Sanskrit in children, please write to[in...@purnapramati.in]()

Raghuram
