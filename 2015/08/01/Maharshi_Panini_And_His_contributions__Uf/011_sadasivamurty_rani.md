Yes Phani Kumar ji!

It is twice discussed in the Dhvanyaloka. Once in the the I Udyota while illustrating Alankara Dhvani and again in the III Udyota in the context of dealing with Gunibhuta vyangya dhvani. In either of the instances there has been no reference to its sources. Even the Vyakhyakaras are silent about the source.

But in the books on Sanksrita Sahityetihasa there is a reference to the source of this sloka specifying to be from the Jambavathi Parinya or Patalavijaya of Panini.

Soon I shall try to upload that proof here.

regards, 

**Dr. Rani Sadasiva Murty**
