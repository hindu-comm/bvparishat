Namaste. I crave your indulgence for this digression. I have come across this sloka quoted in the first udyota of Dhvanyaloka wherein Anandavardhanacharya discusses the presence or absence of dhvani in alamkaras like samaasokti. No source is given for this sloka, though.

Is there an authority which traces this sloka to Panini?
