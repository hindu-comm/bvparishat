All of us know that Ashtadhyayi was the Magnum opus of Maharshi Panini.

But interestingly Patalaviyam or Jambavathi Pariniyam was mentioned in many liteary texts as the earliest known Kavya written by Maharshi Panini. We come across some of the slokas from his Kavya.

अनुरागवती सन्ध्या दिवसस्तत्पुरस्सर:।

अहॊ दैवगतिश्चित्रा तथापि न समागम: ॥ - is a sloka believed to have been taken from Panini's said Kavya.
