We can have the references to the Jambavathi Parinayam which is otherwise called Patalavijayam in 1. the History of Classical Sanskrit Literataure by Krishnamachariar and 2. Survey of Sanskrit Literature by C. Kunhan Raja.

The story of Panini or the Biographical Account of Panini can be had from Katha Saritsagara of Somadeva and Brihatkathamanjari of Kshemendra which both are trusted to be the Sanskrit Translations of Gunadhya's Brhatkatha.

Warm Regards,

**Dr. Rani Sadasiva Murty**
