Dear scholar friends,  

  
Happy Gurupurnima.  

The topic I want to talk about is not strictly scholarly Sanskrit, but it has to do with  

us as members in the society operating under the traditions of our culture and beliefs.  

First the brilliant analysis of our ancestors that life is larger what is sensed locally.  

This thought is so magnificent that the sheer enunciation brings tears to eyes. We pay  

homage to those analytic individuals who must have debated for centuries to arrive at  

this conclusion. We cannot say how "large" is "larger" but we can say that we don't just  

"disappear."  
  

This brilliant conclusion enters into engineering to track individuals in the universe. This  

leads to the realm of judgment, layers of the cosmos, models of liberation and artificial  

technology to help track the unseen trajectory. The philosophy triggers ritualistic processes  

that help us rationalize our understanding. The rituals give us a break to reflect on  

the magnificence of life and the creation and the cosmic processes influencing our local  

existence. We learn to acknowledge the unseen and convince ourselves that life remains  

larger than the local set of the assumed existence, family and friends.
This becomes our  

practice of the religion. We declare that the "unseen" exists, we acknowledge our  

"smallness" compared to the "large unseen", we empower ourselves that we are indeed  

a part of the "large" and we carry hope!  
  

In this practice come various institutionalized rituals that invoke the grandeur of the philosophy  

in our terrestrial life. They include life events, grief recovery, accidents and death. The tradition  

has helped create a class of people who "know" the philosophy and have been termed as  

"brAhmaNa". The religion has institutionalized that the brAhmaNas are indeed the protectors  

of this magnificent faith and the survival of the brAhmanAs is indeed equivalent to the  

survival of the faith. The scriptures prescribe that every ritual must conclude with proper  

celebration of the existence of the brAhmaNas. brAhmaNas are our bridge to our  

"unseen world" of which we are convinced through philosophical analysis.  
  

While full metaphysical comprehension and understanding is possible through deep  

cultivation and restrained living, I was exposed to a bunch of starving human beings in  

Allahabad and Gaya pretending that they need be maintained on behalf of my deceased  

parents. Their knowledge level was rudimentary, their conduct was offensive, their  

demeanor was useless. It appeared to me as though entering a trap of unskilled people  

in an alien land. While I argued and did the ritual myself, I did observe that the "hawks"  

are ready to pounce on the vulnerable who travel from various parts of the country to  

conduct the terminal rituals. I have no idea how long such absurdity has been maintained  

and why some of the seemingly intelligent individuals resort to shoddy pretensions.  
  

I write this note with a request to my friends in various establishments of religious order  

to help reform this artificiality in our grand commentary of faith. I do not know how large  

the corruption is and who the final beneficiaries are. I had to shout and curse at one low-  

level young man who was blocking my entry to the Temple. After I shouted, the "seniors"  

came and had a respectable attitude towards me. To my satisfaction, I realized that  

there are "thinking people" in the mix. I would request our friends to help the millions who  

travel to these holy places every day on behalf of the deceased in their family. I would be  

a little soft when people go out to places to seek fortunes, but I would advocate to protect  

the places where the "unseen" rules as the "after-death" path-maker.   
  

Best regards,  

Bijoy Misra
