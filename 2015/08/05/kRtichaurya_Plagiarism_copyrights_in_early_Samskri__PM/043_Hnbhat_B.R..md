In my opinion all the knowledge we acquire is from learning from the treasury of knowledge accumulated for centuries irrespective of caste, creed, nationality, race and I don,t understand how it come under the copyright law which is an agreement between the author and publisher of the book written using the knowledge we acquired. The copyright law was intended to safeguard the right of the author, from exploitation of the publishers, when he himself is not able to print, publish and market them, only after the printing and publishing business came into existence. And the discussion has turned out to apply it to the abstract form of knowledge, which has no bounds of language and culture.

In that case, every writing we write with the knowledge acquired from our teachers and earlier guru-s including all the ancient Vedic teachers, could not be published as our own as the ideas are from the ideas of our earlier writers. As clarified by Prof.Paturi in an earlier message, copying ideas also would be plagiarism without acknowledging the source.

Good discussion point for the forum of Scholars. Comments are welcome.
