My stand is consistent and fair I may never read his book neither I may, but still I support him because he has been targeted for
plagiarism by vested interests. He has indulged in it by oversight and has not done any whole sale copying. If he has got big attention now or before its the same conversationalists who create it ( Not because he is second Sankara or Ramanuja or Abhinva gupta or a trained scholar or a Sanskrit expert). Many would have not read his work. This controversy will raise curiosity and more will buy his work and the publisher makes good money so does the author.  
  

Having said this I totally agree the views that focus of the discussion can be on how to prepare the younger generation to save themselves from the slips that are the lessons from this episode wasmore meaningful or discussions on historicity of Plagiarism which was a very interesting thread.
