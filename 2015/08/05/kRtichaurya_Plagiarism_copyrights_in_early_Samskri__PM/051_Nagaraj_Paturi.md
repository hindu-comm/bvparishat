\>\>Not any benefit by discussing the legal aspects of copyright in regard to the publication of Ancient Indian Literature in India in this forum, but by the law experts of Indian Copyright Law.

  

Well said.

  

That said,

  

1. Prof. Pandurangi may rest assured that if photograph of a manuscript is copyrighted by thephotographeror his employer,the copyright for the text contained in the manuscript does not go to thatthephotographeror his employer.

  

2. As a research-biased person I would support Prof. Pandurangi in demanding that state should have the right to procure and secure any material including a manuscript useful for heritage studies of the nation and state must keep that material accessible to certified researchers in the field after taking an undertaking from the researcher that the the access so provided is not misused to the detriment of the nation, itssovereignty, its peace and order.
