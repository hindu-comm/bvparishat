Sorry for having got to repeat: ; he always had money, he did not need do these things for money, he was drawing huge attention before this controversy, he did not needto do these things for attention; he did not create the present controversy, it is created by others around him.  
  

Well last mail on this from me publishers will not say no for extra money and I don't know him personally to comment if he had money or not  

Let me now move to the other an most important aspect of this discussion for that interests more. I have stated and clarified my views Thanks for reading them
