Prof. Paturi Ji has reiterated the point that for photos of Anangaranga commentary manuscripts, the copyright is on the photos only and not on the text in the manuscript which is in public domain.

  

A similar situation exists for Rauravagama. The French Institute can claim copyright on the book which has the critical edition of the work. That means nobody can reprint/republish the book (like Chowkhambha republishes out-of-copyright Nirnay Sagar Press books) as long as it is copyrighted without permission of the copyright holder. I would like to repeat that preparation of a critical edition of a text with annotations is a lot of original work, and deserves to be copyright-protected as the guiding principal in these cases is originality. The French Institute cannot, and in my opinion does not, claim any copyright on the original text of Rauravagama in different manuscripts. If another publisher uses primary or secondary sources to publish a new edition of Rauravagama, that should be completely fine as the work is in public domain.

This needs to be discussed more. If Keith has plagiarized from MacDonnel or Oldenberg as Prof. Bhattacharya claims, this should be investigated and brought to the fore, for example by publishing a book with a reliable publisher like MLBD or an article in a peer reviewed journal. If this is shown to be true with sufficient evidence, the unequivocal stand we should take is to condemn it. However, as in law, our guiding principle should be ‘innocent till proven guilty.’
