Dear Dr Pandurangi,  
  

While the point of the note needs wide dissemination,  

the statement "I have not seen Rajivs books and will never read them."  

was stunning. It may help if you explain a bit more.  
  

Manuscript stealing from India is a profession. I do not know if the  

Libraries pay the "scholars" to procure manuscripts. I guess some  

overhead has to be earmarked to clean, collate and maintain.  

But "copyright" is an outright imposition. All must condemn such  

inappropriate assertions. I do.  
  

Best regards,  

BM
