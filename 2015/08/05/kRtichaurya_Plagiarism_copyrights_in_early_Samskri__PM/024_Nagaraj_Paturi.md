\>\>What about plagiarism in Western Samskrit studies? Should it not come to fore?

We should take a stand on it.



 ---------- Prof. Pandurangi

\>\>The point I take is plagiarism done by Indian or Americans or Germans should not matter. I feel to say western writers in past did it so we will continue is no argument at all. All forms of plagiarism should be highlighted and condemned. To say western indulged in plagiarism and got away because of their clout this situation is fast changing and we can change it now as Indians do have an increasing clout.
