Is he a scholar yes but is he a serious professional academic scholar the answer is no.  

  

In such a case, even Wilson, Williams, Maxmuller are also no PROFESSIONAL ACADEMIC SCHOLAR. Does it matter. Scholarship is Scholarship without any attributes. Modification of Scholarship with the superficial terms like ACADEMIC/PROFESSIONAL etc. are very much business oriented. They call it professional because scholarship is used as profession. It is against Bharatiya ideas. Scholarship is to be distributed freely. That is virtue. On the other hand, scholarship taken for profession or money is garhyam (condemned). Hence, professional expertise was never termed as Jnanam/Vidya it was named Silpam etc.

  

Our great seers/scholars like Bhattoji Diksita, Nagesa, Gadadhara, Jagadisa even Sankara etc. can also not be termed as PROFESSIONAL ACADEMIC SCHOLARS as they also quoted many others' works without so-called proper references. But they were serious, academic and scholars of a height that the contemporary PROFESSIONAL ACADEMIC SCHOLARS never even think of.

  

So, if Rajiv Malhotra is not a SERIOUS PROFESSIONAL ACADEMIC scholar then no problem. Because, as per our understanding of the Bharatiya tradition a professional is not a scholar. And a scholar is always serious and academic regardless to his/her profession.
