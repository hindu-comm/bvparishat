Most traditional commentators say they are clarifying and furthering the views of their predecessors When ancient works were written there no copy right act or law. Large libraries with books were not easily available for consultation and they had to depend on their memory. Ascribing ones name to a given work was not their way of thinking. For them content was important not who wrote and from which book and para is sentence quoted. There was a convention not to claim credit for what you have not written and it was by and large followed. There was not millions of dollars money involved in writing and writing was not considered a business, but yes good writing did bring in fame and prestige to the authors who wrote them  
  
You are right Dr. Dash but we need to prepare or generate interests among students and readers to develop scholarship to the level required to understand the bhashyas for which controversies like these don't help. It might bring a lot of attention and money to those who create such controversies.
