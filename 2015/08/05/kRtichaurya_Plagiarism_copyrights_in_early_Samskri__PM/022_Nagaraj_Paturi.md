As Nityanandji pointed out the copyright for photographs of manuscripts of texts is only for the photograph. It does not apply to the manuscript, nor does it apply to the text inside the manuscript. One could click a different photograph of the same manuscript and claimcopyright for that photograph. It is the right accruing from theeffort of photographing that is the copyright. If a person possesses a manuscript, owns it, is not different from owning any object like a chair or a television receiver set. The ownership in such cases comes through the laws of inheritance or rules of trade (selling-purchasing). There is no issue of intellectual property involved. Copyright for the text inside the manuscript is different from this.It lies with the registered copyright holder or comes into the public domain after a certain period. 



If a lone manuscript of a certain textis in the physical possession of a person, he does not allow general public to access it, though the text inside it has come into the public domain, then the situation becomes a little tricky.



\>\>What about plagiarism in Western Samskrit studies? Should it not come to fore?



Prof. Dipak Bhattacharya began to point this out. He has been asking, "Did anyone raise voice against Keith's taking from Macdonell or Oldenberg?"
