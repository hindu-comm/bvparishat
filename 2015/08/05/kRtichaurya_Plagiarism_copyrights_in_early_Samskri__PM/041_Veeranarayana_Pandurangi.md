Indians must have got some money. Who knows? these British people could have used lathis also. But that doesn't mean they should not be acknowledged. You can not by jnana. You must accept vidyarna.

\> c. Westerners were not born with Sanskrit tongue, Sanskrit scholars of their time did agree to the interpretation of western scholars. If Indian Scholars got paid for their work / help, then the works cannot be classified as "Stealing".

\>\> This raises interesting questions. Indeed the silent workers remain unknown. But this is true of many powerful Indian persons too. Just by virtue of their position and connection, many in power got works done by subordinates whose names were not mentioned or mentioned as assistants. A serious enquiry into such exploitation is likely to lead to the opening of the proverbial 'Pandora's box'.Heads may role but the whistle blower may be brought to court.
