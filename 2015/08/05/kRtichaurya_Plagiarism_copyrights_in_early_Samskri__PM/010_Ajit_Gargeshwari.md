This trend to fashion any one and everyone as scholars and write a blog or book self publish it on the web is a phenomena without any parallel in history that we are witnessing in the past ten years or so. Thanks to internet. This has left readers most who are not trained to understand the complexities and nuisances needed, make many a times uncalled for comments controversies or glorify non scholars as scholars and make non scholars and amateurs sound as scholars. This trend is not not confined to Rajiv Malhotra.  
  

To compare Malhotra to Bhattoji Diksita, Nagesa, Gadadhara, Jagadisa even Sankara is most absurd. To say palgarism is right and hence Malhotra needs defense is wrong. He needs defense if he has been wrongly criticised and yes he has been wrongly criticised by certain scholars who have vested interest. This is the reason I supported Malhotra not because he is a scholar or he represents scholarship or he is a champion towards the cause of Sanskrit. Hasn't he withdrawn by saying that he will not quote in books those authors who accuse him of plagiarism and will only quote Indian authors. I hope he will be careful enough in his future works.
