Dear friends,  

  
I missed this petition being on travel. I have known Rajiv Malhotra from his days  

at Harvard in 2001. He did mention about his curiosity to the western views  

in a public meeting that year. I myself ignored such statements until my grandchildren  

were born. The view expressed about India in English literature is most often erroneous.  

It is not the fault of the individual but a wrong orientation. The fact that modern Indian youth  

gets its impressions from the "not-so-informed western writers" has bothered me.  

India has a huge challenge for the future. The colonialism was dangerous when in occupation,  

its infection can create more destructive cleavages. I do feel sorry that the magnificence of  

India's discovery is distorted by cheap excerpts in the name of freedom of speech.  

Rajiv Malhotra is more of a chronicler of the events, but he is less biased than the school  

he fights. I admire the research he does to produce his books. I did enjoy his Indra's net  

and wrote a review.  India must not be configured by arbitrary lenses and to me there  

is no controversy in his point of view. I agree that he is not a scholar to produce new ideas  

or create new system of analysis. As a New Englander I would say that he is the Paul Revere  
warning the minutemen of the British invasion. Paul Revere was caught next to my house  

here in Lincoln, MA. One trips in anxiety!
