Since many have been 'allowed' to post, may I now join ?

  

This is in response to Dr Yadu Moharir's post and partly to that of Prof. Dipak Bhattacharya's.

  

Dr Yadu Moharir focussed on the western scholars' issue whereas Prof. Bhattacharya's post was on the situation inside Indian universities concerning 'exploitation' of Indian subordiantes by their Indian bosses. But he quoted the words of Prof. Pandurangi in which he was talking about the Jones' issue citing and providing a link to an Infinity Foundation's

<http://infinityfoundation.com/publications/IndianPhilosophyatUniversityofHawaii/Indian_Philosophy_at_University_of_Hawaii_by_Shruti.pdf>  

  

It is this pdf which has a discussion on Jones not making any allegation of plagiarism at all, but highlighting what the foundation calls

  

"colonial encounters" that attempted "to inscribe a profound asymmetry of epistemic prestige upon the future East-West exchange of knowledge and its geopolitical implications"

  

I am sharing here the picture of a sculpture discussed in this context in the pdf.

  

The writeup inside the pdf says,

  

"But this sculpture shows - rather starkly - the Brahmins down on the floor, crouching, bare-bodied and subservient, hinting that they are illiterate or ignorant, (when in fact they knew all they were teaching by heart and did not need notes or printed texts!) while an imperial Jones is seated at his desk, writing. The inscription below hails him as “Justinian of India” because he “formed” a digest of Hindu and Mohammedan laws. The truth is that he translated and interpreted into English a tiny tip of the iceberg of Indian *dharmashastra* literature along with some Islamic law books. Yet, the monument depicts Jones as the “law

giver“, and the “native informer*”* to be the *“*receiver of knowledge” "

"This telling sculpture amply illustrates how the semiotics of colonial encounters has attempted to inscribe a profound asymmetry of epistemic prestige upon the future East-West exchange of knowledge and its geopolitical implications."

  

So the discussion inside the pdf is not about plagiarism or stealing but is about "native informer" being shown as a "receiver of knowledge" and the colonial learner being shown as law-giver.
