By signing the petition ,You agreed to



"Their petition rests on a false and baseless allegation of plagiarism in his earlier book"



Now you agree to



"The case is built on exaggerating a few minor copyediting oversights (another word for carelessness or palagarism)"



If 'a few minor copyediting oversights ' is 'another word for carelessness or palagarism'**, '**Their petition rests on a false and baseless allegation of plagiarism **'** is wrong**.** If **'**Their petition rests on a false and baseless allegation of plagiarism' is right, ''a few minor copyediting oversights ' is 'another word for carelessness or palagarism'**' is wrong.**



Who is responsible for the attention he is drawing on account of this controversy? Who started the whole news-making out of the issue or a person who in your opinion is drawing not so required attention?



Would this whole story have begun if Sri Rajiv Malhotra would have been some insignificant person lurking in some cornerwithout drawingany attention?



The huge attention he was already drawing before this whole episodeis expectedly the reason for the importance given to himby the initiation of this whole episode.



So the present big attention is the product of a previous big attention. That is how it all works.



That need not be our concern.



We should either focus attention on either the issues raised about him or by him. Take a fair and consistent stand in this regard.



Earlier discussion on BVP on how to prepare the younger generation to save themselves from the slips that are the lessons from this episode wasmore meaningful.
