Prof. Pandurangi wrote

  
\<One of such persons is vidyanivas mishra who copied one entire book into his name.>  

This seems to relate to copying that is plain plagiarism and not necessarily to acknowledged or unacknowledged help received from other scholars. If my interpretation of Professor Pandurangi's posting is correct then I may add the name of one Sadhu Santidev who copied two chapters verbatim  

from a book by me published in 1984. The copied part appeared in a Cosmo publication (Delhi around 1997) of Encyclopaedia of Tantras. I brought the matter to the notice of Professor Ram Sures Tripathi. He sympathised and regretted but said that that at least showed that book had some merit.  

Indeed we are helpless against intellectual thieves.
