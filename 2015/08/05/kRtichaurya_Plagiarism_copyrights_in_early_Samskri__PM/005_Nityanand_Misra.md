To the best of my information, edited literary works are not treated different from authored literary works. So it should be the same as a normal literary work (sixty years after death of the author). The copyright term for anonymous and pseudonymous literary works have some additional clauses, these are all covered in Chapter V of the Indian Copyright Act. <http://copyright.gov.in/documents/copyrightrules1957.pdf>
