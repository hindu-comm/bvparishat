Namaste:

  

Thanks for trying to lift the lid of "Pandora's Box".

  

Lot of things have been said within the thread, including Westerners having Stolen !?

  

My question to all scholars is to answer question to themselves :

  

  
a. Whether those Western Scholars of yesteryear stole the things or was that knowledge acquired after studying the material under the guidance or help of an Indian Scholars ?  

  

b. Did the the Indian scholars receive any remuneration for services rendered paid for their efforts also needs to considered.

  

c. Westerners were not born with Sanskrit tongue, Sanskrit scholars of their time did agree to the interpretation of western scholars. If Indian Scholars got paid for their work / help, then the works cannot be classified as "Stealing".  

  

d. If they (Western Students) comes to India and registers as a student and gets a qualified degree from the University and writes his/her own reflection what they learned while being a student sould they go under "Theft" ?  

  

IMO - Stealing is Stealing at all levels regardless of the value of the item. Whether it is a Candy or a Diamond.

  

If Rajiv not acknowledged works of previous author in few places then he should apologize, and promise to correct in the future re-prints and move on ......
