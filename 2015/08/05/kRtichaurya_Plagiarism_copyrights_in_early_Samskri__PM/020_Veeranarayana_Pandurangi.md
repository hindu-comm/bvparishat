Dear all  
Leave rajiv. We are not worried about his scholarship. If there can be scholars of this or that history ( say premodern intellectual history or religious history ) in American universities he can be designated a scholar of history of breaking india or history of battles for Samskrit. Sure, he is not a scholar of vyakarana or nyaya. Neither he is claiming it. Nor the people he is confronting are scholars in real sense. Richard fox young etc. Are not Samskrit scholars like cardona etc. He is mostly battling people like Andrew Nicholson, wendy etc.  
Leave them. We support rajiv for shatham prati shyathyam only.

We have serious books like advaitasiddhi etc. To read.

We should be worried about copyrights in real sense. How can anyone claim for copyrights of rauravagama or anangaranga? Leave the western rules. Think of moral issues.

What about plagiarism in Western Samskrit studies? Should it not come to fore?

We should take a stand on it.
