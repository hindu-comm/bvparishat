The point I take is plagiarism done by Indian or Americans or Germans should not matter. I feel to say western writers in past did it so we will continue is no argument at all. All forms of plagiarism should be highlighted and condemned. To say western indulged in plagiarism and got away because of their clout this situation is fast changing and we can change it now as Indians do have an increasing clout.  
  

There are copy right laws. Members of this list do write and are aware of it . Those who are not should make themselves aware that's the whole point discussing copy right laws and its interpretation. Its not enough if one says I am taking a high moral stance so I can violate coy write laws and was not intentional or I did plagiarize and it was by mistake.  
  

I thank Nityanandaji for having clarified a doubt I had about edited books.
