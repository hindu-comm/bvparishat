I do not know who specifically is being referred to, and the plagiarism is not known to me at least. But I can put 2 + 2 together form the clues above and infer from[this list](http://pib.nic.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=108794)and [this list](http://pib.nic.in/archieve/others/2015/mar/d2015032301.pdf) on the MHRD site that the person being referred to above is either[Fran√ßois Grimal](http://www.efeo.fr/biographies/notices/grimal.htm) or[Pierre-Sylvain Filliozat](http://www.efeo.fr/biographies/notices/filliozat2.htm). This is a serious accusation and I would not expect any rational individual to conclude anything without seeing evidence. The assumption has to be innocent till proven guilty. There is nobody preventing us from bringing out evidence in support of this accusation, as Richard Fox Young did in the Malhotra case, for everybody to see - and in fact that should be done for the accusation to be taken seriously.
