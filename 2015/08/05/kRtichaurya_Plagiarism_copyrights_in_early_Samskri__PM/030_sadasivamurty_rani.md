Since a long time this thread onPlagiarism has been running and all the scholars have been contributing their wonderful views on this subject enriching the knowledge of readers. After reading several thoughts of some of the contributers I too would like to share some of my ideas over this subject for the appreciation of all. Here I choose a method of presenting some of my observations and substantiate what I would like say over such premises.

  

1\. In the process of speaking about the concept of Plagiarism in our ancient Sanskrit Literature one of the scholars happened to quote from Anandvardhana as a source of this concept. The text of Anandavardhana is like this:

संवादो ह्यन्यसादृश्यं तत्पुन: प्रतिबिम्बवत् ।

आलेख्याकारवत् तुल्यदॆहिवत् शरीरिणाम् ॥

  

This sloka speaks of संवाद (similarity of writings) in three ways. 1. प्रतिबिम्बवत् (Like an Image reflection in a mirror or water) 2. आलेख्याकारवत् ( Like an image in a Portrait)  and 3.तुल्यदॆहिवत् (Similarity of Bodily features). In all these a reflection, a portrait and the bodily features though maintain some similar characteristics they are surely different from the other thing with which this type of writings maintain some mere similarity.

संवाद or similarity is not the same with Plagiarism.  

  

Just quoting this if we conclude that there was three kinds of Plagiarism existing in ancient times it may become a venture to accept
the originality in the world of poetry after Valmiki and Vyasa. There would not be any chance or necessity for any further research pursuits in the field. It would be just sufficient to read those two great epics and put an end to our thirst of acquiring literary knowledge.

  

The Masters of Ancient Indian Literary Criticism beginning from Bharata to Jagannatha with a single voice proclaim that a progressive poet should see the classical writings and on those lines he has to develop his writings. So the poets are licensed to see and study ancient poetry to produce new writings.

One such advice to Veda Vaysa is found even in the puranas:

**पठ रामायणं व्यास! काव्यबीजं सनातनम् ॥**  

Here the text of the Ramayana is said to be the all time source for all later time Kavyas.

  

**Even in Western tradition those the critics recommended:**

Be Homer's works your study and delight \|

Read them by day, and meditate by night \|\|

  

Hence the above sloka speaks aboutसंवाद and not about एकरूपता \| When the meanings of these two words are carefully observed a good strength of difference between these two terms can be observed.

While **संवाद** is **similarity****एकरूपता**is **sameness**. Similarity is never a wrong thing and it is not Plagiarism but SAMENESS is Plagiarism and it is a sinful deed.  

Like all other Alankarikas the author of DhvanyAloka, Anandavardhana Acharya also

emphasized upon studying the past texts for improving one's own ability of writing poetry.

The following verses of Ananadavardhana support this view:

दृष्टपूर्वा ह्यपि ह्यर्था: काव्ये रसपरिग्रहात् ।

सर्वे नव इवाभान्ति मधुमास इव द्रुमा:॥

The same things elsewhere seen are found in the Kavyas also. But all such old thoughts become fresh and acceptable to all due to their association with RASA just as all the trees shine with fresh beauty in the advent of Madhumasa.

  

संवादास्तु भवन्त्येव बाहुल्येन सुमेधसाम् ।

नैकरूपतया सर्वे ते मन्तव्या विपश्चिता ॥

Anandavardhana advises his readers not to take the two terms : संवाद and एकरूपता

as synonyms.

  

The following slokas also can be studied to understand the concepts of संवाद and not about एकरूपता and to appreciate the richness of Ancient Indian Sanskrit Poetry.

  

आत्मनोऽन्यस्य सद्भावे पूर्वस्थित्यनुयाय्यपि ।

वस्तु भातितरां तन्व्या: शशिच्छायमिवाननम् ॥

अक्षरादिरचनॆव योज्यते यत्र वस्तुरचना पुरातनी ।

नूतने स्फुरति काव्यवस्तुनि व्यक्तमॆव खलु सा न दुष्यति ॥

अनुकगतमपि पूर्वच्छायया वस्तु तादृक़्

सुकविरुपनिबध्नऩ् निन्द्यतां नॊपयाति ॥

  

I shall present my other observations in my future uploads.
