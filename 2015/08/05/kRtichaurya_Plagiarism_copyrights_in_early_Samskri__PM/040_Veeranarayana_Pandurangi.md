Thanks mishraji.  
But according to manuscriptology the critical edition should be same of original text. If then how would copyright it?  
Even otherwise, reconstructed or edited text can be copyrighted by nobody except it's author or his representative or his descendants. In case of no such owners it should be national property, accordingly to dharmasastra rules as applicable to any other properties in such situations. To say a math belonging to a sannyasi should go to his shishya sannyasi, in absence of any such thing it should be state property.  
Pl. Throw away all these copyrights rules you are following. Think in true sense.

Similarly bhagavadgita was translated by Charley Wilkins into English for the first time in 1785. Can he have a copyright on it? That is an insult to original writer. You can't own somebody else's idea merely you have translated it. It is the moral issue. We need not put quotation marks and acknowledge him every time you quote bhagavadgita. If you insist upon it then you are a thief. A Jnanachora. Original idea is important.  
This is what happened to rajiv. Unfortunately he had to depend upon such jnanachoras.  
Quoting a foreign man is too dangerous because of both unreliability and copyrights issues. That proved costly.
