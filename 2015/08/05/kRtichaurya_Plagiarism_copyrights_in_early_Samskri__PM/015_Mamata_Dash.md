With so much of hue and cry, can we claim that we are able to study a text with out the help of the Bhashya or commentary. Do all of us give credit to the commentators. When a talk goes on KAlidAsa or BANabhaTTA, do we give total credit to the commentators.

If some person id propagating our knowledge system in any mean we should welcome it instead of finding all shorts of loop holes. After al it is our tradition gets highlighted and it is we are targeted for such mean activities.

with regards to all the vidvans in the field.
