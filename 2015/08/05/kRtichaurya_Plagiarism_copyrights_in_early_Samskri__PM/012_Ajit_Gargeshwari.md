Would he have got this type of not so required attention? A few thousand more copies of a controversial book is sold. Does this opinion fit in some where or is it my imagination and thinking.

The case is built on exaggerating a **few minor copyediting** **oversights (another word for carelessness or palagarism)** in order to undermine the (enormous or any) credibility and following Malhotra has garnered.
