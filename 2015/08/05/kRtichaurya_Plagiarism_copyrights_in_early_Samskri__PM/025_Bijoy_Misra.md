Prof Pandrangi,  
  

In an article posted a few days ago by Prof Deshpande, it was said that Panini  

was too engrossed in teaching when a lion devoured him. I wish the students  

were proactive in carrying him away. Sometimes we have to violate the teacher  

for the teacher's safety.  
  

I wish the scholars in Nalanda were proactive in escaping the fire.
Apparently  

nobody listened to some apparent forewarning. I visited Nalanda last month in  

my trip. The gorgeous place of learning was reduced to ashes by the ignorant  

intruders The fire burnt for six months, no rescue!  
  
The destructive forces have increased since Nalanda burnt. Hopefully some of  

the scholars would spend part of their time as vigilantes. Religious fanaticism  

is a disease in the world.  

  

Best regards,  

Bijoy Misra
