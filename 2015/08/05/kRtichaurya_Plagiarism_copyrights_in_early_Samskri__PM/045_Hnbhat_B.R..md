Here is how the ancient poets expressed their indebtedness to their earlier poets:

वाल्मीकिगीतरघुपुङ्गवकीर्तिलेशैस्तृप्तिं करोमि कथमप्यधुना बुधानाम्।  
गङ्गाजलैर्भुवि भगीरथयत्नलब्धैः किं तर्पणं न विदधाति नरः पितॄणाम् ॥ ४ ॥ King Bhoja, in his चम्पूरामायण!

Here the history/legends of Raghu kings and its knowledge is copyrighted to Raghu and his descendants and Valmiki recorded and published it in his poem and became आदिकवि through his Ramayana, which was copied with little difference in facts, only the presentation different by many later poets as their common asset investment for writing poetry as one dramatist acknowledging this says:

अहो सकलकविसार्थसाधारणीयं खलु वाल्मीकीया सुभाषितनीवी!!  
अनर्घराघव of Murari.

It is the common asset for the poets, on which poetry writing is based, like the principle investment in a business and he is entitled to the portion of profit only, i.e. his share in the poem.

So there is no plagiarism in Indian Writings at all or every poetry based on Ramayana is a case of plagiarism or कृतिचौर्य! How can Rajiv alone could be accused of plagiarism who is basically Indian for that matter? Many postings aimed at this argument in defence of Rajiv against the accusation in different thread.

I think it is copyright law and not "copy write law" as written in Mr. Ajit's recent message. It is not simply writing a copy of the manuscript, but the right of the author to reproduce and publish which is protected against the exploitation by the publishers.

In all the Editions of the NirnayaSagar Sanskrit Publications, we can see the declaration "All rights are reserved by the Publisher" who is Pandunga Jawaji, the owner of the press. The same question as raised by Prof.Pandurangi, how we can accept the such declarations in all their publications? The above I saw in the Anargaragham of Murari with the commentary of Rucipati and how it is different from the declaration from the publication in question Rauravagama by the French Institute? Only the difference is NirnayaSagar Press is Indian Publisher and the French Institute is obviously French.

The author of AnarghaRaghava Murari or the author of the commentary, nor their descendants, could not have possibly sold the "copy right" to Pandurangi Jawaji receiving the royalty amount ( A**royalty payment**is made to the legal owner of a property, patent, copyrighted work or franchise by those who wish to make use of it for the purposes of generating revenue or other such desirable activities. In most cases,royalties area and designed to compensate the owner for the asset's use, and are legally binding.) so that they can reproduce and publish for ever. How NSP can own all the rights including the "the copyright" the highly discussed in almost all the related threads?

Is the copyright law is enforced with retrospective effect since the millenniums so that it could find a place in these discussions related to the ancient works written since the past milleniums?

Now the question with respect to the prospectus of participants Scholars working in and for the publishing houses and/or Institutions, as applied to NSP. Only the names of the Editors are printed in some and in many anthologies and publications rarely a mention edited by the Scholars at NSP. I do not remember exactly. One may check with the Kavyamala Series. How many scholars are named in their publications who might have assisted in proof reading?

The point is just the Editors do not claim copyright nor the authorship of the book and their roll is specifically acknowledged as Editors. How this cannot become an act of plagiarism in Indian Publisher when the same act by the French Institute is discussed in this context? Is it simply because the ownership of the Institutions are Indian and the French or Scholars working in the projects are Indians or Westerners?

Reading all the discussion on plagiarism and copyright law in different threads in I had the same impression.
