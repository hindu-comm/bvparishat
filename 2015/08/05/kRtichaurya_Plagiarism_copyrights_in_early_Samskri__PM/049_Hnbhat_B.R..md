Now I am again doubts

When the copyright law was enforced with retrospective effect?

Whether it was enforced sine Vedic times or since the respective countries passed copyright laws in their countries?

To copyright any patent, published material, it has to be legally registered by the author or owner of the material or the product as I understand.

If the material/product/book is not copyrighted by the author/owner of the product, there is nothing prohibiting legally the copyright of the product by the producer. This is my understanding. The law was intended to prevent other users making/claims to the revenue from the sales of the product/books and not merely copy writing is copy right in the context of the laws pertaining to the countries. If it were, now onwards, someone may approach the India Law Enforcement to sue those publishers of Sanskrit books and ask for a petition to withdraw all their publications back for the violation of Indian Copywriter Law if it is confirmed as such. But not by
