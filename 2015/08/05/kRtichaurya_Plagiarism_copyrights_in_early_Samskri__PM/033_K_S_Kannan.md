Salutations to, and Imprecationsagainst, Plagiarists !

  

Plagiarism has always been frowned upon - whether in*kAvya*or*s'Astra.*

*  
*

Twoexamples , one from each field, should suffice:

  

***kavir anuharati cchAyAm***

***  padam ekam pAdam ekam ardham vA /***

***sakala-prabandha-hartre***

*** sAhasa-kartre namas tasmai !! //***

*  
*

"A poet emulates the shade of an idea, or may be a word, or a quarter \[of a verse\] oreven a quarter \[of a verse\].Salutations \[however\] to him, the rash guy, who steals an entire work \[and passes it off as his own\]!"

  

The satirical note here will sure not be missed !

  

***yo nAma kas'cid iha samviditam prameyam***

*** granthAntare likhati vA, vadati svayam va /***

***mat-kartRtAm ananukIrtya sa kIrti-lobhAt***

*** nissantatir jagati janma-s'atAni bhUyAt !! //***
