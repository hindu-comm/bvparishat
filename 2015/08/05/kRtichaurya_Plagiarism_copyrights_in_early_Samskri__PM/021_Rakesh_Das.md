I was just trying to bring the same point as prof. Pandurangiji says. I never compared Mr. Malhotra with Dikshita etc. My point was about the superficial claim of ownership of knowledge in the name of Copyright. Moreover, according to my opinion, western so-called PROFESSIONAL SCHOLARS use plagiarism and copyright against the persons whom they could not answer by their PROFESSIONAL knowledge. If there is an issue that can be addressed then let it be addressed. Why so much crying over plagiarism?

  

And most important thing, Prof. Pandurangiji also thrusting upon is what about the western scholars' plagiarism? (Please note that I admit that they are scholars. Nobody's scholarship can be challenged due to mere plagiarism).
