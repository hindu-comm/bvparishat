Good analysis of copyright law in respect of manuscripts of ancient works the authors of the original work are not even known or popularly known like Vyasa, Valmiki, Kalidasa are no more alive now to claim copyright.

1\. The remaining ones the custodians of the copies of the manuscripts like the Institutions like the Oriental Libraries Government and Private like Adyar Library, or the Private Institions like the French Institute in question run by foreigners (which is the part of this discussion seems to be focussed in relation to their alleged violation of copyright law against Rajiv Malhotra).

2\. The editors, translators, assistants helping the publications by the Institions. The question not focussed whether these Indian Scholars employed by the employer Institutions should be eligible for the published by the Institutions or the custodian of the manuscripts the publishers mostly the Institutions? This seemed to me the focus.

3\. In the case of Independent Editors and translators, the may keep the copyright themselves or give the copyright to the publishers (unless the are themselves publishing) for a Royalty amount as I have heard. If Royalty is not paid, they can claim a share in each reproduction the publisher makes.

4\. In the case of scholars employed by the publishing houses or the Institutions, who are paid for their work, does the copyright law apply? How copyright vested with the custodian of the manuscripts could be transferred to the publisher?

5\. As per the title of the thread कृतिचौर्य or Plagiarism could apply in these Indological works either by western or Indian Scholars? I fail to understand this. Can this made clear.
