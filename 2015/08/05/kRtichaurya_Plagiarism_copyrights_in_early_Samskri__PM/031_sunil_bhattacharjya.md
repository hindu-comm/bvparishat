Dear friends,  
  

We are discussing plagiarism and the issue got highlighted due to Rajiv Malhotra being implicated for plagiarism. While there are many supporters in favour of Rajiv's good work, the accusation against him could be to silence his good work as Rajiv himself mentioned.  
  
Plagiarism is basically an issue of snatching credit from one who deserves and is not necessarily a question of distortion. We have before the serious scholars some more serious cases of distortion, like the distortion of historical dates in the literary field. Recently we had a discussion on the Hunabda. Ancient Indian sources tell us that Bhanugupta who defeated Toramana lived before the date of Jesus Christ, but currently available Indian historical texts put the date around 5 or 6 centuries after Christ.  
  

Regards,  

Sunil K
