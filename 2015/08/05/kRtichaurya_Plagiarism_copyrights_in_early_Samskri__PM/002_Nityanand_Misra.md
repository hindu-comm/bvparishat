Prof. Pandurangi Ji

  

Thanks for starting this thread. Instead of a single long response, I would like to add my comments over different aspects in several responses. In this response, I would like to comment on the copyrights of the photographs of the manuscripts in possession of Cambridge University.

As far as my limited understanding goes, there are four copyright issues here:

\(1\) Copyright on the original text of the Anangaranga

\(2\) Copyright on the commentary on the Anangaranga

\(2\) Copyright on the manuscript of the commentary

\(3\) Copyright on the photographs of the manuscript

  

As the original text of Anangaranga is from India and dates from 15th or 16th century (source[here](http://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-ADD-01605/1)), the work is in public domain because the author has been dead for more than 60 years. This is as per the Indian copyright Act which is available [here](http://copyright.gov.in/documents/copyrightrules1957.pdf). As the commentary is anonymous (as mentioned [here](http://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-ADD-01605/1)), we do not know when the commentator died, but since the manuscript is from mid 18th or mid 19th century (source[here](http://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-ADD-01605/1)),the commentator has been dead for at least 150 years, and so the commentary is almost certainly in public domain (I do not know of any country that has a law which protects copyright for more than 100 years after the death of the creator). The manuscript also has original creative work which includes calligraphy, illustrations, colophon etc. As the manuscript is from Nepal (as mentioned[here](http://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-ADD-01605/1)) and dates from the mid 18th or mid 19th century, the works is in public domain because the scribe has been dead for more than 50 years. This is as per the Copyright Act of Nepal which is available [here](http://www.nepalcopyright.gov.np/pdf/The%20Copyright%20Act.pdf).

  

Now we come to the photographs of the manuscript. These are not in public domain as they are copyrighted by Cambridge University (and not the photographer, who may or may not be dead). As one can see from the attached documents, although the copyright of the photographs belongs to Cambridge University, the photographs are licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported (CC BY-NC 3.0). The license summary is [here](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/), and the full license text is [here](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/legalcode). Anybody can share the photographs of the manuscripts and even create derivative works, as long as they attribute the \[original\] photograph to Cambridge University and as long as their use is non-commercial. So one may not make money out of the photographs directly (e.g. by selling digital images or printed copies of the photographs) or indirectly (e.g. by using them as artwork on a book cover to promote a book). Note that this version of the CC license does not have the ShareAlike (SA) feature, which means one can create images (derivative works) from the photograph by cropping, enhancing, editing, etc, and these derivative works need not be released under the CC-BY-NC 2.0 license - the derivative works can be released under any other licence (like CC BY) which allows users to use the derivative works even commercially. The only condition is that the creator of a derivative work must attribute the original work to Cambridge University (e.g. as a notice on a webpage or a page in a book).

  

I think it is fair that Cambridge University has licensed the images under CC BY-NC. They have not watermarked the images and have placed the copyright and license notices outside the manuscript part which makes them easy to use. Even better would be a CC-BY license (least restrictions, only needs attribution), or an open licence like [CC0 1.0](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) the which the British Library uses for manuscripts (see [here](http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/reuse.asp)) - this has no restrictions on use, but the BL ‘requests’ that credit to BL be given.

  

I would also request list members to read about the case of Bridgeman Art Library versus Corel Corp, where a US court ruled that there copies of images in public domain cannot be copyrighted. The Wikipedia article is a good start (though I do not vouch for it being 100% accurate): <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridgeman_Art_Library_v._Corel_Corp>.
