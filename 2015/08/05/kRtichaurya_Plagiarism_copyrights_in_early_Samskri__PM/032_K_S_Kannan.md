Dear All,

  

The following was my response to someone who asked for a formal reaction from me regarding the plagiarism issue with respect to Rajiv Malhotra.

  

Regards,

**The Puerile Charge of Plagiarism**

“Sling mud; even if the mud does not stick, the stain will stay for long!”

*asatyam api dur-vachanam chiram tishthati* = Vilification, even if groundless, lasts long !

Such are the maxims that are being deployed by the vituperative attackers of Sri Rajiv Malhotra on grounds of plagiarism.

Rajiv Malhotra has been consistently and systematically working for over two decades on but one theme: preparing antidotes against the continued supercilious intellectual colonialism by the West over the East. For the West, it is the White Man’s Burden - to enlighten the East - bearing kinship to the saying “Whenever a politician decides to commit a crime, he declares it first as his duty.” The brazen attacks on, and exploitation of, other civilisations by the West constitute a steady and ceaseless creed, for centuries, of the “more equal” Big Brother, veritable master of the Orwellian “doublespeak.” 

The Hindu civilization, which never had imperial aspirations against other civilisations, has had been a steady and steadfast producer of ennobling knowledge for millennia. The *Mahabhaashya* of Patanjali (1^(st) Century BCE) spoke of the pursuit of knowledge for no specific worldly gain (*nishkaarana*).

**  
**

**Knowledge -Engineering**

Knowledge was pursued in *gurukula*-s, in the simple and quiet hamlets, thousands of them, throughout the length and breadth of the country, without any great burden on the royal exchequer, apart from vast conclaves of forest-dwellers on the one hand, and world-class universities on the other. The spirit of free but disciplined enquiry buttressed by a continuous evaluation of knowledge produced in the past, and revisions and reformulations as also alternative formulations of the same, non-production of knowledge dangerous to society, free and open dispersal of such knowledge as is healthy and beneficial to the society (without being obsessed by “ownership” of ideas, that is) were its hallmarks, none of which has ever had a worthy parallel in the world.

Greek thinkers rose to great heights, too, but their civilizational vigour and intellectual rigour did not last for more than a few centuries.

**  
**

**Riches and Rogues**

Against the charge of “mere other-worldliness” projected by the dishonest critics against the culture of India, or the charge that religion has been the cause of the country’s backwardness, Dharampal has laid bare very well how India was a top economic power in the world even uptil the 17^(th) century, which is what made the hordes of the colonizing barbarians of the West set their eye on this rich country with their single agenda of plunder and loot, with full sanction, of course, from the Vatican. To cite a quotation of Newcomb (*no date*) from Malhotra’ s *Being Different* (2011: 164-165),

“Christian nations had a divine right, based on the Bible, to claim absolute title to and ultimate authority over any newly ‘discovered’ Non-Christian inhabitants and their lands .Over the next several centuries, these beliefs gave rise to the Doctrine of Discovery used by Spain, Portugal, England, France, and Holland – all Christian nations .”

(More juicy details can be gleaned from Romanus Pontifex of Pope Nicholas V). And they were only following the footsteps of their other imperialist kinsmen of the Abrahamic faith, the brutal perpetuators of the sole religion of peace, which is in no wise opposed to burning of libraries (oh, what a great patron of knowledge!), alongside, apart from perpetrating unspeakable atrocities - past perfect as well as present continuous. Cultural genocide is, of course, the common cult of these two fellow faiths.

**Cultural Genocide**

Of the two, the West, which is all sophistication in its methods, can be likened to the duplicity : Orphane a bright child first, and then declare self to be its sole, *and benevolent*, guardian. What the Westerners did to Africans and Native Americans are cases that suffice to drive home the point. Ananda Coomaraswamy was among the early writers to see through, in his early writings especially, this game of Western Indological scholarship, and to expose its hollowness and hypocrisy. To cite another author, but only illustratively, what the West did for Africa was thus exposed by Alain Danielou (1969): 

“Although today colonialism has abandoned, in Africa as in the other countries of the 'Third World', its most brutal forms of genocide and slavery, the concepts of cultural and racial superiority by which it justified itself have not been honestly revised. The appearances and above all the methods have changed, but the fundamental attitude not in the slightest. A cultural colonialism that conditions economic aid has today become a more subtle arm of domination. The importation of a foreign culture into small population groups, in exchange for special privileges and a semi-assimilation to the West, permits the formation of a false elite made up of elements that are entirely dependent on external connections and are the perfect mediators of cultural domination…”.

Already in 1761, William Law asked men to “look at all European Christendom sailing round the globe with fire and sword and every murdering art of war to seize the possessors and kill the inhabitants of both the Indies. What natural right of man, what supernatural virtue, which Christ brought down from Heaven, was not here trodden under foot?” (p180)

Sir George Birdwood wrote in *Industrial Arts of India* (1880), of what British education did for India.

“Our education has destroyed their love of their own literature... their delight in their own arts and, worst of all, their repose in their own traditional and national religion. It has disgusted them with their own home - their parents, their sisters, their very wives. It has brought discontent into every family so far as its baneful influences have reached.”

What they did to India culturally is, ultimately, to dislodge the traditional learning system from the *paathashaalaa*-s and *gurukula*-s, usurp the knowledge therein for a pittance (if indeed that), and declare themselves to be the sole guardians/interpreters of this age-old treasure-house of knowledge.

**Malhotra’s Munificence**

The singular contribution of Rajiv Malhotra has been to lay bare the
machinations of these Machiavellians, and even more importantly, place things in a global perspective, which hardly many of even the most zealous of Indian intellectuals could barely perceive.

“It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends on his not understanding it.”, said Upton Sinclair. This explains why the Youngs, Foxes, and Goldmans cannot digest what Malhotra says, much less the sepoys under the pay of the Ford Foundations, or the NGO-heads that they fund and patronize.

It is this that inspires them to make the charge of plagiarism for they have begun to get the feeling that, should the present course of Malhotra’s polemic continue, their intellectual ivory tower may well one day be detonated. Does Malhotra *need* to plagiarise? Whatever for? His *Indra’s Net* (2014) cites from over 150 sources, and *Being Different*(2011) from over 225 sources (and some of them, multiple times). Even Nicholson has been cited over 30 times in a single book. If there is a lapse in attribution in half a dozen places, the same can be politely pointed out, and corrections can be introduced in future editions. Mr Malhotra will be more than willing to make his books more error-free: I have myself pointed out nearly a century of minor lapses and corrections to his *Being Different,* and they have been duly incorporated in the paperback edition.

**Stigmatise so as to Discard?**

However, if the whole stratagem is to give him a bad name so that it may provide the censorious academicians a plank to ignore his ideas, this is nothing but chicanery. It is the height of unfairness to cast dubious allegations on the intellectual integrity of a person who has been quite dignified in countering his opponents purely academically.
