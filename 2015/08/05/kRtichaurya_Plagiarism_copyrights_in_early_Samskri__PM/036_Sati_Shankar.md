Vidvadjan,

There is an added dimension to Plagiarism as act and as allegation, in the context of Indology.. Interestingly I cam across a book recently which exposes many malpractices after, as the author claims, going through "Origin" of the information...... just want to share ,The very title + its subtitle clears its coverage... it is **'TRUTHS** : 500 Years, Eurpoean Christians in History, War, Robbery, Murder, Genocide, Occupation, Exploitation, ChurchES, Universities,DemiGods like Max Mueller Prepare the Ground"
