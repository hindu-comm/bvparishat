Dear all  
  

With the recent controversy on rajiv's works. there is a huge war cry against Rajiv because of his कृतिचौर्य of seven sentences. I have not seen Rajivs books and will never read them. but it is only curiosity.

  
I am curious to know what was the situation of early Samskrit scholars like William Jones etc. Whether they did translate on their own or with the help of local Samskrit scholars but did not mention anything of that kind. Example. Jones does not mention any name in his institutes of Hindu law. And he is credited with Justinian's place by Oxford.

Similarly Wilson wrote his dictionary in 1819. he mentioned one Raghumani Bhattacharya and says that his dictionary is translation of one dictionary prepared by learned pandits for College of Fort William. But there must be many people involved in the process. there is no such mention. it may be Same about the amarakosha translation by HT Colebrooke (I have not seen his book)  

The problem is not west bashing.

still many western scholars find it difficult to understand or interpret samskrit language though being designated as Indologists (either by themselves or somebody else) even in the age of all the digital appliances and helps available for the study. 

the pioneers like HH wilson and MW Williams would have faced a too difficult situation when no translation of whatever text was available with no dictionary at hand. how they uderstood texts and interpreted them? with or without learned pandits? why no such mention is made?

Does it get designated plagairism or not?

  

what about the copyrights

there are many instances where editor/publisher may have copyright. for example Rauravagama vol II published by French Institute in 1972 is mentioned that copyright rests with French Institute.

now comes the question as to what is the thingFrench Institute has done to rauravagama to claim the copyright in its hand? it has not written the book. it has collated and made new copy of the book in this process. how does it get copyright?

even a translation of the same does not entitle one to have copyright of it. copyright should rest with author or the person institute authorised by him.

similarly cambridge university has claimed copyrights for the attached Manuscript of anangaranga. I have attached a few pages showing the copyright. what the great thing cambridge has done for this manuscript? who is the owner? how it is bought? this is really funny.

  

is it not plagairism?

  

I think no. it is the theft itself.

  

  

offcourse we all know peronally a western sanskritist working in india for many years and making all kinds of plagairism by stealing works (not sentences) and even getting the last years presidents award for it.

I dont need to mention his name.

his plagairism is well know to everybody including western scholars who are crying for blood of rajiv. but they keep silent. it is theirhypocrisy. But these very people are censuring the poor rajiv (not literally) for his efforts to unearth the bad intentions of few people.

  

I invite your comments on this issue.
