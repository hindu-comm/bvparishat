I believe the publication being referred to is this one:

<http://www.worldcat.org/title/rauravagama-edition-critique-par-nr-bhatt-introduction-les-agama-civaites-par-jean-filliozat/oclc/77456342>

  

A copy of the book is available on the website of Archeological Survey of India:<http://asi.nic.in/asi_books/65296.pdf>

  

The book's title is *Rauravagama / édition critique par N.R. Bhatt ; introduction: Les Agama çivaïtes par Jean Filliozat*, which translates as *Rauravagama / critical edition by N.R. Bhatt ; Introduction: TheŚivaiteAgama by Jean Filliozat*.

  

The copyright of theInstitut français d'indologie (French Institute of Indology) is on the book which is the critical edition of the work. The preparation of a critical edition involves a lot of original work (studying various manuscripts, selecting the critical text, annotating different readings) and should in principle be protected by copyright. I do not think the French Institute created a new copy of the critical edition, rather, it appears that it published the critical edition compiled by N R Bhatt for the first time. However, the original text of the Rauravagama is not copyrighted.

Chapter VI of Indian Copyright Act deals with translations. If the work is in public domain (e.g. Ramayana), anybody can write a translation and copyright the same. If not, then one may apply to the Copyright Board for a license to translate a work seven years after its first publication.
