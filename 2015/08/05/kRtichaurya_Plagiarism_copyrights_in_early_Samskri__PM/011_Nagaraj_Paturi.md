Dr Gargeshwari,



In the thread "Support Rajiv by petition", you said.



"I signed the petition.I request all our members to support the petition I hope to see Prof. Panduragi's article soon. "



The petition has the words :



" Their petition rests on a false and baseless allegation of plagiarism in his earlier book, “Indra’s Net”. Their case is built on exaggerating a few minor copyediting oversights in order to undermine the enormous credibility and following Malhotra has garnered over the years on the strength of his well-researched critiques of the partisan agendas of leftist scholars and their patrons "



Now you say,



" The reason Rajiv Malhotra is getting all this attention is because he did what he did indulged in plagiarism "



Is this fair?
