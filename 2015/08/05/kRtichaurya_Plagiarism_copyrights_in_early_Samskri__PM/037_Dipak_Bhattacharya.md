This raises interesting questions. Indeed the silent workers remain unknown. But this is true of many powerful Indian persons too. Just by virtue of their position and connection, many in power got works done by subordinates whose names were not mentioned or mentioned as assistants. A serious enquiry into such exploitation is likely to lead to the opening of the proverbial 'Pandora's box'.Heads may role but the whistle blower may be brought to court.  

It is a difficult task to bring the culprits to the book.
