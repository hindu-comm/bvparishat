Let me put it this way verses of Bhagavata have no copy write. If I bring out a critical edition I would have put in my thoughts and I choose verses omitting a few suggest emendation to the original make note of variants etc.I use my judgement and put in years ofhard work going through many manuscripts. I am not the original composer but still it can be and has to be copyrighted to avoid some one else publishing my book in his name an taking away my credit. I am lose my promotion and due to this!!

  

Primarily copy right laws are designed to generate revenue for the publisher and author. If a work is under copy write and it should not be it can be challenged in a law court depending on the evidence.

  

Charles Wikins translated verses from Sanskrit to English. The English he uses is his own. Hence it can be copyrighted. How can this be termed as an immoral act. Morality does not come into picture as publishing is a business. My conscious says all knowledge should be made free is it possible in the world we live in today. Authors should write and publishers should not make money. But some where we have to draw a line.

  

In Rajivs case this is not what happened he quoted a few words from another authors work without acknowledging the source. The dispute is has he been unjustly criticized for a small error? The answer in clear he has been unjustlycriticized by those who have an agenda apart from scholarship.
