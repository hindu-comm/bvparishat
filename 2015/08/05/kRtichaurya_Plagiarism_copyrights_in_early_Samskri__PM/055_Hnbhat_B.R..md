While the translation by western were paid services of Indian Pandits as an act of plagiarism 18th - 19th centuries in some post during the heated discussions, I cite an an act of writing poems and sell it for some to be published in his name recivin payment in early Indian reference in Indian Literature by Acharya Mammata in his Kavya Prakasha while discussing the benefits of writing poems:

काव्यं यशसेऽर्थकृते व्यवहारविदे शिवेतरक्षतये \|

सद्यः परनिर्वृतये कान्तासम्मिततयोपदेशयुजे \|\| 2 \|\|

कालिदासादीनामिव यशः, श्रीहर्षादेः धावकादीनामिव धनम्,

According to the commentators, it was Dhavaka who wrote the drama Ratnavali (not attested in Kavyaprakasha) in the name of श्रीहर्ष reading money for writing it, later published in the name of श्रीहर्ष as the dramatist.  

If there is any truth in this allegation it, it is not at all different from the act of Sanskrit Pandits translating into English in the name of their rulers/heads for whom they work or or the instances of Publications by the heads of Research Institute. The point deserving notice is that it is not a new practice in the colonial rule, but long ago rooted in India sine the rule of Indian Kings. The same had been alleged of the numerous writings in the name of King Bhoja, including his magnum opus शृंगारप्रकाश the encyclopedic work on Indian Literary criticism. This could be defended as the greatness of the genius of the King, if one wants to do so. And this allegation could be said as the act of insulting the Indian Genius by the western Indologists, as in the case of Rajiv in connection with which the whole discussion about plagiarism and Copyright has been initiated in different threads including this one.
