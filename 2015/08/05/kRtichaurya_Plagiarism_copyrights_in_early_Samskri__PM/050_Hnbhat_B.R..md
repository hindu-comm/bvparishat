Sorry. The message was posted incomplete.

Not any benefit by discussing the legal aspects of copyright in regard to the publication of Ancient Indian Literature in India in this forum, but by the law experts of Indian Copyright Law.

Here is a handbook on ******the Copyright Act, 1957 (as amended from time to time) and the Copyright Rules, 1958 (as amended from time to time)****** a guide for the public

<http://copyright.gov.in/documents/handbook.html>

Here it clarifies the scope of the law:

****What is the scope of protection in the Copyright Act,1957 ?****

**The Copyright Act, 1957 protects original literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works and cinematograph films and sound recordings from unauthorized uses.**

**Unlike the case with patents, copyright protects the expressions and not the ideas.**  
**There is no copyright in an idea.**

And the validity of copyright protection is specified clearly:

****copyright protected in perpetuity?****

**No. It is protected for a limited period of time.**

****What is the term of protection of copyright?****

**The general rule is that copyright lasts for 60 years. In the case of original literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works the 60-year period is counted from the year following the death of the author. In the case of cinematograph films, sound recordings, photographs, posthumous publications, anonymous and pseudonymous publications, works of government and works of international organisations, the 60-year period is counted from the date of publication.**

In total, the copyright Act was enacted in India in in1957-58 and the NSP has not learnt to copyright from Europeans, but followed Indian Copyright introduced in 1958 by Indian Government.

From Bhattacharya's posts, it is not specific to westerners only to violate copyright laws, but Indian writers also. From Pandurangi, both Indian or western publishers are violators of copyright law passed in India passed in 1957 or whoever publishing any Ancient Literary Work was having declaration of copyright are forgers than publishers.

I am sure Pandurangi would like the declaration in the copyright page published as Copyright Reserved by Valmiki, Kalidasa etc. for all books and studies on Ramayana, its translations and adaptations, criticisms on it. This is a point deserving to be discussed in respect of any Indological Publications of Indian Ancient Literary Books in future. (The current Editions and translators and their are not seen to be following this convention in the existing publishing coventions).
