**Bhalchandra Nemade**

Making a stirring revelation at a lecture at Mumbai University, Jnanpith Award winning novelist Bhalchandra Nemade Thursday said that the common belief that Marathi originated from Sanskrit is untrue. The 73-year-old Marathi litterateur also said that “Sanskrit did not give birth to all modern languages. In fact, it too has evolved from other languages.”

Twenty five languages are spoken across Maharashtra, not one of them have originated from Sanskrit, he added.

Cracking the whip on the increasing number of Marathi families sending their children to English medium schools, Nemade said, “English medium schools have taken toll on Marathi medium schools. The perception amongst parents that convent education would offer their children lucrative careers while education at Marathi medium schools will spoil it is absolutely wrong. The state should frame a rule making it mandatory for Marathi families to send their children to Marathi medium schools.”

Nemade was speaking on ‘contemporary literature and society at the fourth Rajiv Gandhi Lecture at the university.

Gauri Mahulikar, professor of department of Sanskrit, Mumbai University said that Nemade may be right in saying that Sanskrit is not the source of all Indian languages. “There are two theories to this. Majority of people, like us, believe that Sanskrit is mother of most of the Indian languages and is the oldest and most purest form of language.

This is a popular belief. However, many even believe that not Sanskrit but Prakrit is the source of the modern Indian Languages. Nemade may have meant something on this line,” Mahulikar said.
