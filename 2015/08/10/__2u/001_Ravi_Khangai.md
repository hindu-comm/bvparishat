Dear scholars,

i am developing a paper on the topic of

'patriarchal myth making in the mahabharata: restoring virginity'

many women character's( Kunti, Draupadi, satyavati) virginity is restored in the epic. this is reflective of the patriarchal attitude towards women's sexuality.

suggestion about any related work in indian context or outside will be a great helpful

thanks!
