Namaste  
  
Can anyone kindly give the verified reference of this verse -  
योगेन चित्तस्य पदेन वाचां मलं शरीरस्य च वैद्यकेन...  
  
I have looked into the previous postings on this verse in BVP. Some post says - it is in the beginning of Vyasabhashya to yogasutra, the other says it is in the beginning of Rajamartanda of Bhoja. But the verse is not found in those texts.  
  
Or I might have even missed the correct reference which might have been mentioned by some scholar in BVP.  
  
I request scholars to kindly help.  
  
regards  
Jayaraman, Chennai.
