The first occurrence of the idea is in *Ayurveda dIpikA*, the commentary of cakrapANi (11th c. CE) on *caraka samhitA.*

*  
*

The second occurrence of the idea is in *patan'jali carita* of rAmabhadra dIks"ita (18th century).

  

The actual occurrence is in the commentary (*darpaNa*) of s'ivarama on *vAsavadattA* of subandhu, (on the expression *kathako bhujan'garAjAyate).*(14th century ?)

  

But the first juxtaposition of the three disciplines (*cikitsA, laks"aNa and adhyAtma*), though in the reverse order, is to be found in the *vAkyapadIya* of bhartRhari 1.147 *kAya-vAg-buddhi-vis"ayA* etc.
