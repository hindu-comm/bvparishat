I thank the learned members of this list who responded to my request on योगेन चित्तस्य पदेन वाचां मलं शरीरस्य च वैद्यकेन...  
I have an 1898 Nirnayasagar edition of Patanjali caritam. I did not find the verse among the 600 odd verses in the work.  
  
  
Meanwhile, I continued my search and found the following. I am sharing the info.  
  
The encyclopaedia of Indian philosophy, Volume 12 edited by Gerald James Larson, Karl H. Potter etal, pg.56 says   
It is from Kancana-darpana an 18th century commentary by Sivarama Tripathin on Vasavadatta of Subandhu.  
  
The encyclopaedia also observes that Bhoja and Cakrapanidatta also have written verses with the same idea. But the wordings are different.  
  
I would be greatful , if any scholar can share the web link for the commentary Kancana-darpana on Vasavadatta. I searched the web but could not find any.  
  
regards  
Jayaraman
