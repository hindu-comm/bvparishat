They have digitized Thee Journal of Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society all the back issues in 2 DVD and they are selling them for Rs 800. When I called to inform them that I was interested in buying and if it is possible to send them to Bangalore, I was asked to come over to Mumbai and buy them. For Rs 800 I need to spend 3,000 on traveling
