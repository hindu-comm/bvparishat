At the root of the problem of plagiarism, seems to be theकर्मफलाशा and अहंकार inherent to Intellectual property Rights, which does not go with Indian culture.

-   It is not difficult to see thatपाणिनीया शिक्षा was not composed by
    पाणिनि himself, maybe by some disciple of his. May also be that the
    disciple hadपाणिनि's endorsement for the composition to be known by
    his name. -   The openingश्लोक of श्रीमन्महाभारतम् is said to be नारायणं
    नमस्कृत्य नरं चैव नरोत्तमम् \| देवीं सरस्वतीं व्यासं ततो जयमुदीरयेत्
    \|If that is so, how wouldव्यासमहर्षी say obeisance to himself
    also ? The fact seems to be that whatश्रीमन्महाभारतम्we read is
    possibly the one as narrated byसूत to शौनकादिमुनयः in
    निमिषारण्यम्.सूतhimeslf got to be listening to it when it was
    narrated byवैशंपायन in the court of जनमेजय at the end of सर्पयज्ञ
    of course at the instance ofव्यासमहर्षी's ordain.व्यासमहर्षी had
    taught it toवैशंपायन based on the text whichव्यासमहर्षीhad got
    taken down by Lord Ganesh. If we think of number of editions,
    whichश्रीमन्महाभारतम्underwent, I guess, it is some smartness
    ofव्यासमहर्षीhimself to weave around such chain of events, right
    in the Preamble, if one may say so, basically with the idea
    thatश्रीमन्महाभारतम् will be read and narrated and studied down
    eons and ages. Changes may happen. He will not be responsible for
    those. Yet he has put down, what is eternally valuable. No
    copyright, no Intellectual Property Right.
-   That is the essence of indian culture. Knowledge grows by sharing
    and rusts by not sharing. -   In the verses pointed out by Dr. Bhat, another aspect of Indian
    culture is humilityविद्या विनयेन शोभते 

I keep wondering whether western Indologists deserve to be so called, if they do not grasp and appreciate Indian culture. I did not participate in any discussion on Plagiarism all this while, only because I find that so-called western Indologists basically lack basic understanding and appreciation of Indian culture. I would rather neglect and maybe, even pardon in my own mind people who lack it. They don't deserve any of the attention given to them.

  

I am impressed that Dr. Nagaraj Paturi has brought in a different perspective by starting this thread of Converse of Plagiarism.
