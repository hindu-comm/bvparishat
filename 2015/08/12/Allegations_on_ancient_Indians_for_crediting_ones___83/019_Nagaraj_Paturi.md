The very fact that people are saying, "ye Bhartrihari, your ideas are wonderful, great, innovative in their own right. Why do you unnecessarily credit your ideas to some older scholars?"

  

shows that

  

The books would not have gone into oblivion if they did not say, 'the ideas here are from our predecessors' .  

  

Their books did not get authenticity only because they said,'the ideas here are from our predecessors'?
