Welcome back AdaraNiya Vidyasankarji.



\>\>To some extent, this perspective assumes that the best, or even the only, way to be an individual is to be informed by European cultural values.  

-- Shall we say modern European cultural values ? because, 'giving the reference to the predecessor's work with all the details of the published work's title, publisher's full address, year of publication, edition number, page number and all such details,to provide all such details properly following a proper style-sheet', was not part of the European writing too during pre-modern times.



There is a stereotyping-born assumption that Asian or more specifically Indian traditions alone were oral while the European ones were literate from the beginning. But the fact is that literacy, documentation and print at a later stage are all as new to European societies as they are to Indian tradition. In fact, literacy, documentation and print revolutionized theEurope first and later the entire worldthrough them, so much that many major portions of contemporary world culture can be explained in terms of these developments only.



How do we know Socrates, except throughreferences to himby Plato, Xenophon and Aristophanes? Is there any extant work of Socrates? Why should anyone believe that such a person ever existed? There is so much of his thinking that we read today, everything reconstructed from the extant works.



Why only the European classical writers ? Even within Indian culture, unfortunately many works of the Lokayata/ Charvaka are not extant. But modern researchers, justifiably,leave no stone unturned in reconstructing their thought from the extant works.



Why, only in the case of certain ancient Indian works, the theory that references to the names of predecessors are just for acquiring legitimacy through antiquity/ tradition be propounded while such references are to specificnames of persons and books?



As you said, when a Sankara or a bhatRhari says \> let me add Ramanuja, Madhva etc.\<that he is articulating a particular sAmpradAyika view, even if he mentions specific names of predecessors in that sampradAya, a judgement that the author is thereby hiding his own original interpretation stops just short of accusing the author of intellectual dishonesty. This is a systemic problem in the world of Indian studies that desperately needs to be set right.
