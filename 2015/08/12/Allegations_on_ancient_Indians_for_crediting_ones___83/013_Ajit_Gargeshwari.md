Yes don't you think so unless one pays lip sympathy allegiance to vedas even which Naiyayikas do else it will nasthika and many will not read them or would have not been given access to read them in the pre-printing era The same may apply to to the vast commentaries and sub commentaries we have in Vedanta. They are faithful to their traditions yet devise ways to put in their thoughts. Probably they were afraid to say they were independent unlike modern authors who can say easily and yet find readers Exceptions were there in the past i don't say no
