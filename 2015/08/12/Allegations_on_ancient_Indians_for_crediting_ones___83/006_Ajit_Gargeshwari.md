I thank scholars Dr. Bhat and others for having taken up this discussion. I had made a remark about reverse plagiarism in another thread and these inputs will be use full to me . Prof. Aklujkar had
taken exception the Iused the word" trend" But there is a trend  

Can we also add works ascribed to Shankara and also discuss Kalidasa Apocrypha by Sures Chandra Banerji Chowkambha and similar works in the context of this thread  

I don't Expect any heated arguments since I mentioned Shankra
