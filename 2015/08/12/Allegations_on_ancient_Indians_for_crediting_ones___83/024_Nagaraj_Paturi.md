How interesting this approach of the modern methodology!

  

If an ancient author doesn't credit any predecessor for his ideas and the modern researcher finds a predecessor's work to which he can trace those ideas, the author is blamed for plagiarism.

  

If he credits his ideas to a predecessor and the modern researcher can not locate that predecessor or he fails to trace the ideas to the predecessor's work, the author is blamed for trying to acquire legitimacy through false crediting to a predecessor.

  

What is the way out for this ancient author to escape the blame?

  

He ought to have given the reference to the predecessor's work with all the details of the published work's title, publisher's full address, year of publication, edition number, page number and all such details. It is his fault indeed not to have provided all such details properly following a proper style-sheet !!

  

On the other hand, if a modern author mentions the name of a Greek philosopher for the origin of ideas say, taxonomy or nomenclature in biology however disconnected these two notions modern and classical Greek) of taxonomy or nomenclature are, it is hailed to be historical consciousness.
