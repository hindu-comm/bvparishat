कर्मफलाशा and अहंकार inherent  
  

I keep wondering whether western Indologists deserve to be so called, if they do not grasp and appreciate Indian culture. I did not participate in any discussion on Plagiarism all this while, only because I find that so-called western Indologists basically lack basic understanding and appreciation of Indian culture. I would rather neglect and maybe, even pardon in my own mind people who lack it. They don't deserve any of the attention given to them.  
  
  

I don't understand what Abhahyankarji wants to convey? what have you against Indolgists? Indology in the widest meaning is a study of Bharata and its culture Lets not taboo a word here.  
  

Are you saying all Indian writers are saints who have renounced and every one else is greedy I don't subscribe to such a view.  

  



"That is the essence of Indian culture. Knowledge grows by sharing and rusts by not sharing."  
  

We have been sharing what we know. We should expand by sharing articles that we write that I agree  
  
Converse of Plagiarism I said reverse Plagiarism is it different
