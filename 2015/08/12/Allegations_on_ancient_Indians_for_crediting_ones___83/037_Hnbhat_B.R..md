यायावरीयः is Rajashekhara himself, or someone he lists in his Introduction:

" स मूर्तो यत्रासीद् गुणगण इवाकालजलदः,  
सुरानन्दः सोऽपि श्रवणपुटपेयेन वचसा ।  
न चान्ये गण्यन्ते तरल कविराजप्रभृतयो,  
महाभागस्तस्मिन्नयमजनि यायावरकुले।।

It is believed his own views are added as इति यायावरीयः than somebody among his predecessors.
