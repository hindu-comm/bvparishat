While starting the current thread itself, I said,

Dr Gargeshwari's

come under this category of

I said,

  

But there is a different situation. The author of the book is a famous, celebrated one only. But he says that the ideas in his book are not his. He is just preserving the ideas of the 'tradition', ideas of his predecessors, ideas of his gurus through the book.

  

As Dr Gargeshwari rightly reminded us,

  

> 
> > authors hiding their name completely and allowing the book to pass for > the work of others. >

was already discussed in another thread.

  

That is why a new thread is started for a different issue.

  

Here the topic is not disowning the book/poem/work, it is disowning innovation of idea(s).

  

Thanks
