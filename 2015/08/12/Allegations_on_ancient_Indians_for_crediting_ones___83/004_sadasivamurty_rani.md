Having been inspired by this new thread I would like to add an iota of information to this stream regarding the Dhvani Theory of Anandavardhana. All the scholars in the field of Alankara Sastra know that Anandavardhana Acharya was the pioneer in the field of Alankara Sastra to speak about Dhvani Siddhanta. There has been no available Alankara Sastra Text to speak about Dhvani at least as a concept of Poetics. Yet he begins his text with his proclamation that there has been in the established tradition as per the opinion of the predecessors in the field of Poetics DHVANI is the SOUL of POETRY.  

काव्यस्यात्मा ध्वनिरिति बुधैर्यस्समाम्नातपूर्व

स्तस्याभावं जगदुरपरे भाक्तमाहुस्तमन्ये ।

कॆचिद्वाचां स्थितमविषयं तत्त्वमूचुस्तदीयं

तेन ब्रूम: सहृदयमन:प्रीतये तत्स्वरूपम् ॥

He makes an attempt to show three preexisting schools of thought prior to his times.

1\. Dhvani was established as the Soul of Poetry by a traditional stream of scholars.

2\. Others are there who include Dhvani in Bhakti  (Lakshana)

3\. Still there are people of another school who accept Dhvani as an independent concept it is beyond words to explain its nature.

Having spoken of these three schools, having established a tradition for his new theory he proceeds, taking an oath, to begin his Discourse on Dhvani Theory.

  

In the popular commentaries on Dhvanyaloka, the magnum opus of Anandavardhana, the commentators tried to correlate the Vaiyakaranas who established SPHOTA Theory as the predecessors of Anandavardhana. But nowhere in the Vyakarana we can find statements announcing Sphota as the Soul of Poetry (काव्यस्यात्मा

ध्वनिरिति बुधैर्यस्समाम्नातपूर्व....) \| So surely Vaiyakaranas need not be the ones who inspired Anandavardhana to say these words. The fact in this connection is yet to be traced out.

But this instance of Anandavardhana's First Karika can be correlated to the present context.

Warm regards,

**Dr. Rani Sadasiva Murty**
