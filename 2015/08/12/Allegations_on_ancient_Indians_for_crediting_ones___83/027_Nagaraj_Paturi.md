I went back to the other thread where the other kind of disowning was discussed. There, I found the following good advice from Prof. Aklujkar:



A good historian should be prepared to shake off the weight of earlier Indological scholarship, and a clear, uncontested statement in traditional sources should not be lightly set aside. My experience so far indicates that traditional India had a much better sense of history than modern scholarship tends to assign to it.
