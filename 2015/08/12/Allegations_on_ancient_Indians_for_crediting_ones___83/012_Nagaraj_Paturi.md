Thanks for "please carry on nice discussion".

  

But both do not amount to the same.

  

"A convenient method to they adopted to gain authenticity and to allow their works to be read else it would have gone to oblivion"

  

may apply to the other variety discussed in the other thread, 'authors hiding their name completely and allowing the book to pass for the work of others'

  

In the currently discussed type, 'A convenient method they adopted to gain authenticity and to allow their works to be read else it would have gone to oblivion' does not apply.

  

Let us take the example of vAkyapadIyam or dhvanyAlOka. Would the books have gone into oblivion if they did not say, 'the ideas here are from our predecessors' ?

  

Did their books get authenticity only because they said,'the ideas here are from our predecessors'?

  

In fact, their readers are taking their works as authentic. The authors and their books gained authenticity in their own right. The readers are giving them the credit for the innovation of the ideas in the book. It is the authors who are disowning that credit.
