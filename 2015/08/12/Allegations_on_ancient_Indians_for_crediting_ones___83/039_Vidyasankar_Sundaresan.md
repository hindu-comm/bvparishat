One larger issue that needs to be addressed seriously by this assembly of vidwAns is the notion of individuality in different cultures. There are certain assumptions and conclusions in the writings of many generations of Indologists, about Indian culture subsuming individual identity (or even lacking individuality altogether) in favor of caste identity and tradition. To some extent, this perspective assumes that the best, or even the only, way to be an individual is to be informed by European cultural values.

Therefore, when a Sankara or a bhatRhari says that he is articulating a particular sAmpradAyika view, even if he mentions specific names of predecessors in that sampradAya, a judgement that the author is thereby hiding his own original interpretation stops just short of accusing the author of intellectual dishonesty. This is a systemic problem in the world of Indian studies that desperately needs to be set right.

Best regards,
