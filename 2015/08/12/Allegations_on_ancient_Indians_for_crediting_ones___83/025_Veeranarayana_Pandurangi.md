shishya crediting guru or some elder by ascribing his to guru does not amount to plagairism. it is a kind of respect or at maximum false ascription. Guru not is taking credits from shishya. infact when guru is dead by the time of ascription he can not be a संप्रदान.

similary पाणिनीयशिक्षा need not mean necessarily as a panini's work. it is a work in the line of panini's thinking.

अथ चेत्त्वमिमं धर्म्यं संग्रामं न करिष्यसि। ततः स्वधर्मं कीर्तिं च हित्वा पापमवाप्स्यसि।।  
तस्मादुत्तिष्ठ कौन्तेय युद्धाय कृतनिश्चयः। निराशीर्निर्ममो भूत्वा युध्यस्व विगतज्वरः।। (भ.गी.)
