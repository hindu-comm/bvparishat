Many good works of poetry have survived because they are said to be written by Kalidasa

  
  
Aastika schools are being called so because they accepted S'abda as a pramANa or they said what they said on the basis of vEda as one of the sources of valid knowledge. If nyAya can stand without s'abda pramANa and this pramANa can be proved to be not necessary for nyAya's survival, if nyAya could have said what it said without using vEda as a source of valid knowledge, or it did not have as one of its contents proving vEda to be a source of valid knowledge, then it can be suspected that incorporating vEdaprAmANya was done just to get an Astika stamp.  
  

Would Nyaya or any Nasthika school have survived without paying homage to vedas and accepting vedas as the highest pramanA? Can Nayayikas have a pramana higher than the Vedas though they are not explicit implicitly they accept vedas as the highest. Can one have a apata vachana contradicting the vedas? The rock bottom agreement of all the traditional schools are they accept vedas in Toto. It can be symbolic or a lip sympathy. Veda Pramana was accepted to get Nastika stamp and acceptance  
  

I am not saying creativity and original ideas had no place but was always camouflaged by saying what they are saying is what their predecessors have already said or it was for the clarification, or for those who were not as intelligent as their predecessors who would have become God by then or would have acquired cult like status. The founders of those schools many have cautioned against making them Gods but take their views after using their own judgement. This was never followed or followed by only a few. Even using one own judgement against a predecessors work was considered a crime.  
  

This might be one the reasons for reverse plagiarism or ascribing one own work to a famous person of the past ascribing ones work to a King was obviously for a different reason
