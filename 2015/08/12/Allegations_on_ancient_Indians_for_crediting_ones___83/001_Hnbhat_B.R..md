What about the similar statement by Acharya Dancing in his Kavyadarsha :

पूर्वशास्त्राणि संहृत्य*प्रयोगानुपलक्ष्य च।*  
यथासामर्थ्यंमस्माभिः क्रियते काव्यलक्षणम् ।। १.२ ।।

And the statement by Amara:

समाहृत्यान्यतन्त्राणि संक्षिप्तैः प्रतिसंस्कृतैः ।। १.०.३ ।।  
संपूर्णमुच्यते वर्गैर्नामलिङ्गानुशासनम् ।।

They claim the credit for compilation of their work and clearly acknowledging indebtedness to the works by the earlier writers.

Later literary critic depending on their earlier works establish their theories criticizing their works. But the later lexicographers compiled their lexicons with the same words and similar classifications, few hundred more or less than in Amarakosha.

One Mahimabhatta casually mentioned some people write books write books to gain fame by ctriticizing earlier accredited writers. I could not right now remember his statement right now.
