Many thanks for you correction I agree.  
In fact, Nyaya does not have an actual allegiance to the Vedas. May be prachina Nyaya did have.  
  

"This they did, so as to get readers or to get permission for their readers to read their books"  
  

This they did so to be asthika and not be branded permanently as Nasthika  
  
Similarly, many commentators in Vedanta deviated from the traditions (say, Advaita or a certain strand of it such as Bhamati school) to which they claimed allegiance. But they did not own up the deviation, they did not articulate their disagreements with their predecessors, only because they were afraid that they wouldn't get readers or would have been out of the school or sub group they were affiliated with. Every one did not have the capability to start their own school within the school or Sub school they belonged to or did not have the necessary clout. They were many a great scholars who were victimised. I would go to the extent of saying independent voices was not the norm an exception.
