Let me reorganize this for my convenience:

  

Yes, don't you think so?

  

Unless one pays lip sympathy allegiance to vedas,
(whichevenNaiyayikas do) else it will be considered a nasthika book and many will not read them or would have not been given access to read them in the pre-printing era.

  

The same may apply to to the vast commentaries and sub commentaries we have in Vedanta. They are faithful to their traditions yet devise ways to put in their thoughts.

  

Probably they were afraid to say they were independent unlike modern authors who can say easily and yet find readers.  

  

" In fact, Nyaya does not have an actual allegiance to the Vedas. But Naiyayikas pay lip sympathy allegiance to the Vedas. This they did, so as to get readers or to get permission for their readers to read their books"

  

Is this what you want to say?

  

"Similarly, many commentators in Vedanta deviated from the traditions (say, Advaita or a certain strand of it such as Bhamati school) to which they claimed allegiance. But they did not own up the deviation, they did not articulate their disagreements with their predecessors, only because they were afraid that they wouldn't get readers"

  

Is this what you want to say?
