Not sure if this point has been made before - "Argument from authority" is a persistent problem when it comes to finding the truth. A convenient way of deflating this flaw is to ascribe every philosophy/ view and its opposite to some hoary sage. That way, one ends up evaluating ideas based on their inherent merits. This may have been a motivation in hindu authors downplaying their contributions to a small or large extant.
