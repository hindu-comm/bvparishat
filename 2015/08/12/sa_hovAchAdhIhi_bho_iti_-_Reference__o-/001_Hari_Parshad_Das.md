\~\~ śrī-śrī-rādhā-dāmodarāya namaḥ \~\~  
  
this text has been quoted several times by several vidvāns in the past but none of them quoted the source.  
  
Some places where this has been quoted:  
  
1) Śrīmad-bhāgavatam commentary of Srila Sridhar Swami on verse 10.87.30 (the verse beginning with aparimitā)  
  
2) Brahma-sūtra-bhāṣya 1.1.5 of Srila Madhvacharya.  
  
3) Sandarbhas of Srila Jiva Goswami.  
  
4) Śrīmad-bhāgavatam commentary of Srila Vijayadhvaja Tirtha on verse 6.4.28 (the verse beginning with sa vai mamāśeṣa....)  
  
However, none of them have quoted the source, and it seems that the source of this quote was shrouded in mystery even for the vidvānas of the past.  
  
sādhu-caraṇa-rajo 'bhilāṣī,  
  
hari pārṣada dāsa.
