Dear friends,  
  

May I have a question on the enquiry on the following:  

  
1) Śrīmad-bhāgavatam commentary of Srila Sridhar Swami on verse 10.87.30 (the verse beginning with aparimitā)  
  

4\) Śrīmad-bhāgavatam commentary of Srila Vijayadhvaja Tirtha on verse 6.4.28 (the verse beginning with sa vai mamāśeṣa....)  
  

According to the sage Vedvyasa, the puranas have been so composed that these are intelligible to all people including the women and the shudras (who could not avail the faciltity for proper schooling for various reasons), for whom the Vedas are inaccessible. Vedavyasa had to compose the Bhagavatam, as he was remorseful that he could not make the Mahabharata intelligible to all and the Sage Narada advised him to compose the Bhagavatam to give the same message (in a simplified way) so that it becomes intelligible to all. Sri Madhvacharya seems to have not agreed with Vedavyasa on this point. According to Sri Madhvacharya the Bhagavatam is not easy to understand without his commentary. Because of that Sri Sridharacharya's guru had found it necessay to advise him to write a commentary (obviously from the advaitic standpoint). Thus the race began and there appeared the various commentaries and I am sure we would have seen Vedavyasa very unhappy, had he been among us today.  
  

Now my question is as follows. As the present situation warrants that we have to recognize the various commentaries, has anybody made any attempt to make a critical study of the various commentaries on the Bhagavatam, so that the ordinary people know in what way the various commentaries differ from each other.  
  

Regards,
