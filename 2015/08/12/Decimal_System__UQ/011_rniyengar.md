Dear Ajit,

Your question is important in tracing the history of scientific thinking in the pre-Aryabhatan period. But a definition or description of what one means by "decimal system" is necessary. If it is counting integers with base "Ten" Yajurvedic texts contain magnitudes increasing in tens/hundreds. Words like "Ekaadas'a, Dwaadas'a.." also hint at the base being "Das'a". But if you are referring to 'place value system' that is of writing numbers and numerals, first we have to discuss development of scripts. Previously in connection with 'lekhanam, lepanam....' and 'lipi' this was discussed to some extent on BVP. About Pre-Aryabhatan arithmetical calculations in writing, I think one will have to refer to the studies on the famous Bakshali Manuscript. BB Datta may be a good starting point. Others in the list may add to or correct the above points.
