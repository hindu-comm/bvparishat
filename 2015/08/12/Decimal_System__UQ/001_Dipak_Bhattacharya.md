Aryabhaṭṭa clearly mentions that his achievements were appreciated in Kusumapura कुसुमपुरेऽभ्यर्चितं ज्ञानम् implying that he himself had first expounded the theory of the revolution of the earth on its axis. Before him no one had said so. Before him the rise of the sun was regarded as movement by the sun itself. Āryabhaṭṭa explained the illusion by analogy. Any claim to an earlier discovery is to be ignored.
