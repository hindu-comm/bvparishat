I thank Prof Iyengar and Prof Kannan for the replies. While I wait for Sarton's paper. May I ask a another question? What are the books or articles that one can refer to for pre Aryabhatta Indian decimal system or do all existing published literature point towards post Aryabhatia origin of decimal system in India.  
  
I have marked this mail to Michael Danino as suggested by Prof Iyengar  
  

Not related to does potteries kept at Madras museum point to a script older than Mahenjodar and Harappan Civilization?
