Dear Professor Gargeshwari,  

The position of Mr. Srinivasiengar is not clear. One has to mention the system of counting accurately. For, it is one thing to count orally that almost universally takes 10 as the first series. As is wellknown this has been done after the physical example of ten fingers. But inventing the sign for zero and giving it the power of indicating ten when placed after 1 and then regenerating a new series with the nine digits taking the place serially and so on, is the clue to the writing of numbers in a decimal system. This was not known to the Romans or the Greeks. The Arabs took it from India.

Is there any proof that this system of writing the numbers existed before Āryabhata? Āryabhaṭa describes it orally through verses with akṣaras indicating the numbers. But that is very accurate and one can easily substitute numbers for the akṣaras. Did Āryabhaṭa inherit it? He does not mention any predecessor. The evidence of a pre-Āryabhaṭa emergence of this system must be credibly established when such claim is made.

Best

DB
