Thank you Prof Bhattacharya.  
  
Srinivasiengar C.N. has not mentioned about Mesopotamia but was written Mahenjodar and Harappan Civilization hence I was curious to know which excavations reveled those details to him  

I also wanted to know which pottery belonging to the megalithic an Neolithic ages kept at Madras Museum acts as an evidence to show earliest examples of specimens of writing in India.
