Srinivasiengar C.N. in his book "The History of Ancient Indian Mathematics" on Page 4 says  
  
"Writers of Mahenjodar and Harappan Civilization which may be a period of 3000 B.C. or so, briefly refer to Decimal System of  
numeration found in these excavation. But they have not thrown much light on the subject, but the written documents seals  
and inscriptions of this period as also the pottery belonging to the megalithic ( 1500 B.C.) and Neolithic ages (6000-3000 B.C.)  
preserved in the madras museum give the earliest examples of specimens of writing in India."  
  

I was curious to know on what basis he makes the above statement or he arrived at such a conclusion Thanks in advance for any pointers
