The source of information for CNS was most likely the paper by

G.Sarton: "A Hindu Decimal Ruler of the 3rd Millennium" Published in *ISIS*, 1936 pp323-326.

It is generally accepted that the billets unearthed for measurement of weights also follow the decimal system.

For a copy of the above paper pl send a private mail.
