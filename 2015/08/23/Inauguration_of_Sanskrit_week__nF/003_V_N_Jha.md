Dear Maltiji,

I was happy to read your enquiry about the Sanskrit course at the Chinmaya International Foundation, in Kerala. I do not have your e-mail id. Can you share ? For a long time we are not in touch. Where is Dr. Rooderman ?

  

I shall write to you after I get your e-mail id ?

  

Best wishes for the Sanskrit day celebrations.

  

VNJha
