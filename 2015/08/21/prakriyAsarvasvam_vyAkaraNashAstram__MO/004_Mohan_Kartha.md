namastE,

  

I have a copy of it sent to me by error in response to a request for another book published by the GuruvaayooR dEvasvam. I have no need for it, but there is an article at the end of it which I like and I would like to read the introduction also, otherwise I would have gifted the book to you. If you live in the US, I can lend it to you for a year or so if you pay the shipping both ways -- perhaps $15 or so (it is a heavy book).

  

Let me know if you are interested in borrowing it.
