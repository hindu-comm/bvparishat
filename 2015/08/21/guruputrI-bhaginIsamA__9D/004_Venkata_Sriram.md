Namaste,

  

The shAkta tantra says that:

  

guruvat guruputrESu guruvat tatsutAdiSu

pratyahaM pUjanaM kAryaM chAmunA vidhinA priyE

gurOrabhAvE chArvangi gurupatnIM cha pUjayEt

tadabhAvE varArOhE gurukanyAM cha pUjayEt

tadabhAvE mahEshAni gurusnuSAM prapUjayEt

EshAM abhAvE chArvangi gurOrgOtraM prapUjayEt

  

One should worship the sons of the guru just as one worships the guru; if guru is not at home, then the guru-patni should be worshiped; if guru-patni is not at home, then guru-putra should be worshiped; if guru-putra is not at home then guru-putri should be worshiped; if guru-putri is not at home then the daughter-in-law of guru should be worshiped; if she is not at home, any relative of the guru bearing the same gotra of guru should be worshiped.

  

regs,

sriram
