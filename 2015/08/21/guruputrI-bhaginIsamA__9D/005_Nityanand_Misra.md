The context in the*Mahābhārata* is to be kept in mind here,Verses copy-pasted from[https://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/महाभारतम्-01-आदिपर्व-071](https://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/महाभारतम्-01-आदिपर्व-071)

  

WhenDevayānī asks Kaca to marry him,Kacafirst her that she is worthy of his respect, being the duaghter of his Guru. In this context, Kaca does not say that being the daughter of his Guru makesDevayānīhis sister.

  

कच उवाच।  

पूज्यो मान्यश्च भगवान्यथा तव पिता मम।

तथा त्वमनवद्याङ्गि पूजनीयतरा मम॥

प्राणेभ्योऽपि प्रियतरा भार्गवस्य महात्मनः।

त्वं भत्रे धर्मतः पूज्या गुरुपुत्री सदा मम॥

यथा मम गुरुर्नित्यं मान्यः शुक्रः पिता तव।

देवयानि तथैव त्वं नैवं मां वक्तुमर्हसि॥

  

Devayānī replies by saying that Kaca is also worthy of her respect and being the son of her Guruputra. She adds that Kaca is not the \[biological\] son of her father \[and hence a union between the two could be possible\]. She also reminds Kaca the affection she showed when he was killed by the demons again and again. Highlighting mine.

  

देवयान्युवाच।

गुरुपुत्रस्य पुत्रो वै न त्वं पुत्रश्च मे पितुः।

तस्मात्पूज्यश्च मान्यश्च ममापि त्वं द्विजोत्तम॥

असुरैर्हन्यमाने च कच त्वयि पुनःपुनः।

तदाप्रभृति या प्रीतिस्तां त्वमद्य स्मरस्व मे॥

सौहार्दे चानुरागे च वेत्थ मे भक्तिमुत्तमाम्।

न मामर्हसि धर्मज्ञ त्यक्तुं भक्तामनागसम्॥

  

To this, Kaca replies that as he had resided in the body (the word used is*kukṣi*) of Kāvya (another name of Śukrācārya), and so hadDevayānī, this makes Devayānī his sister as per*Dharma*. By the context, it appears this is the reason Kaca considers Devayānī his sister: not the fact that she is his Guru's daughter, but the fact that both of them resided in the body of Śukrācārya.

  

The context is this: when Kaca was killed for a third time by the demons, his body was burnt down to ashes, and the powder was mixed in a drink offered to Śukrācārya which he drank. When Śukrācārya realized Kaca was in his stomach, he taught him the *mṛtasañjīvanī vidyā.* Then Śukrācārya broughtKacaback to life but died in the process. Kaca then brought Śukrācārya back to life. As Kaca resided in the stomach of Śukrācārya before coming back to life, he *became* the son of Śukrācārya when he was brought back to life. The comparison to the episode ofJahnu and Gaṅgā is to be noted. Gaṅgā is known as the daughter of Jahnu as she resided in the body of Jahnu.

  

Devayānī also resided in the body of Śukrācārya: in the seed (vīrya) of Śukrācārya.

  

Here are the verses (highlighting mine)

  

कच उवाच।

अनियोज्ये नियोक्तुं मां देवयानि न चार्हसि।

प्रसीद सुभ्रु त्वं मह्यं गुरोर्गुरुतरा शुभे॥

यत्रोषितं विशालाक्षि त्वया चन्द्रनिभानने।

तत्राहमुषितो भद्रे कुक्षौ काव्यस्य भामिनि॥

भगिनी धर्मतो मे त्वं मैवं वोचः सुमध्यमे।

सुखमस्म्युषितो भद्रे न मन्युर्विद्यते मम॥

  

Also to be noted is the case of the Uddālaka who offered his daughterSujātā in marriage to his disciple Kahoḍa (Kahola). This narrative is also in the*Mahābhārata.*

*  
*

Commentaries on the two episodes may be consulted for more insights.

  

One may refer P V Kane's work or theSmṛti works to see if a marriage with the Guru's daughter is indeed prohibited byśāstra or not. The Smṛti works explicitly lay down rules of marriage appropos the*varṇa*, *gotra*, and *piṇḍa.*If a Smṛti prohibits marrying the daughter of one's Guru, that should be brought out instead of secondary sources.

  

I would also urge members to note the context in the verses from the secondary sources they cite. There are indeed verses and rites which confer the status of father on the Guru, but are they in the context of marriage? The context is important. For example, the words*vasudhaiva kuṭumbakam* arespoken in thecontext of magnanimity of the character (udāracarita). It may not be entirely appropriate to apply them to the context of marriage. If we do, we come to the incorrect conclusion that as the whole world is one family, all marriages are incestuous.
