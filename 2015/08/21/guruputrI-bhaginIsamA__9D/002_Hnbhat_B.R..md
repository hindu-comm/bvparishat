"janitā copanetā ca yaśca vidyāṁ prayacchati\| annadātā bhayatrātā pañcaite pitaraḥ smṛtāḥ\|\| "

The above verse says the teacher who gives vidyāṁ is to be considered as one of the five fathers as per the Shastra-s. So the student is called धर्मपुत्र which naturally makes the daughter of his Guru his sister.

In this case Kaca is धर्मपुत्र and Devayani is औरसपुत्री of शुक्राचार्य which itself makes his sister without any other testimony to this effect.
