नमस्तेे,

Is there a शास्त्रवाक्यं / स्मृत्युक्तिः / पुराणकथनं of the rule that गुरुपुत्री is भगिनीसमा..?

Any place where it is explicitly mentioned as a non-practice-able thing to marry one's guru's daughter? Or is it a thing of general understanding, generally accepted norm in शिष्टलोकः, that she must be treated as one's own sister?

In the सुप्रसिद्ध story of कच and देवयानी, she happens to want to marry him, but he rejects her, saying, she is his guru's daughter. What is the basis of that rejection by कच? This question is asked here on behalf of someone.
