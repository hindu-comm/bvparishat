1\. creative writing? not subhashita, then. narrative or non-non-narrative poem, play etc. I think.



2\. Case study on the literary work or case study on an actual teacher of present times with the help of a literary work of this kind?



If it is the former, 'case study' in literary studies is not an established method/methodology of study.



Usually when a generalization is verified for a specific book they use titles such as 'study of ....(generalization).... : .....(literary work) - a case study or 'study of ....(generalization).... : the case of ........(literary work) - a study.
