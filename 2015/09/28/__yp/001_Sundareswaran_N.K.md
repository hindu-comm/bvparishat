Dear Scholars,

  

  

A Researcher in the Education Department of our University is in search of a literary work (creative writing ),in Sanskrit, written specifically between 12th to 18th centuries, having moral, social and ethical responsibilities of a teacher as its focus. She wants to make a case study on it.

  

I request learned scholars to respond with details.

  

  

with Pranams,

N.K. sundareswaran
