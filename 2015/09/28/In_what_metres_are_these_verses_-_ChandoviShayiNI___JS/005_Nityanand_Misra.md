Should be considered upajāti.

  

My mistake, theएषस्स्वप्नो हि verse is complete, the message was trimmed after पुरा which I failed to notice. Third line should have वृतिरिह in place of वृत्तिरिह. Second, third and fourth have 21 syllables with the Sragdharā pattern, first foot has only 20 syllables. Maybe a scribal error?
