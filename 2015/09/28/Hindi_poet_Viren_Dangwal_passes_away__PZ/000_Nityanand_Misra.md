Dear list members,

  

I am sad to inform the list that noted Hindi poet, editor, litterateur, translator, and Sahitya Akademi Awardee (2004) Viren Dangwal passed away this morning in Bareilly. He was suffering from oral cancer from some time. Viren Da, as he was popularly known, was awarded the Sahitya Akademi Award in 2004 for his anthology दुष्चक्र में स्रष्टा (*duṣcakra meṃ sraṣṭā*). He was especially known for translating international poetry from many parts of the world into Hindi: he translated poetry by Pablo Neruda (Chile), Bertolt Brecht (Germany), Vasko Popa (Serbia), Miroslav Holub (Czech Republic), Tadeusz Różewicz (Poland), and Nâzım Hikmet Ran (Turkey). His own Hindi poems have been translated into Bengali, Marathi, Malyalam, and Oriya.
