This is a matter pertaining to sasyashastra, plant science. Dr M Sundara Rajan, prof. of botany has worked extensively on botany in Sanskrit and has also published his findings.His D.litt. thesis is, Glimpses of plant science from Sanskrit sources. Dr. Sundara Rajan can help.  

unfortunately I don't have his no. or mail address. He was in jain University for sometime. perhaps Dr. R.N. Iyengar can help.
