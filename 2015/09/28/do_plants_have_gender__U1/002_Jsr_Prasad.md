Thanks Vidwan Nityanand ji, for explaining these modern terms. Description on *monoecious* and *dioecious* seems to based on morphological features of plants. Or does it includes the plant anatomy also. What could be the parameters to fix the genders, wherever applicable? Please convey our regards to your respected father!
