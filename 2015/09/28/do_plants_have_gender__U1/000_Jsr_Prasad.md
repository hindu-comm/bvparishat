Respected Scholars,  
  

According to modern plant science, plants or trees have gender and they can transform respective genders based on seasonal changes. I think, this concept is a bit complicated, for a person like me, as in plants one can see some parts to be male and the others to be female. As far as my primary and limited observation goes, āyurvedasaṃhitās do not provide any clues of gender in plants, as per the materia medica (I may be corrected).  
  
However, I am just curious to know, if any such references available in Vedic/Sanskrit literature.  
  

One of our colleagues from sciences asked me this question. If female type of *Tinospora Cordifolia* (guḍūcī) is prescribed for certain ailment, how to identify the right one? If the other type is chosen and used, then there could be adverse effects. I was not ready to buy his argument as, at least, at rudimentary level, there is no gender specified by ācāryas, whatever parts (pañcāṅgam) are prescribed of the plant, one has to go with that.  

  
Also, modern plant science speaks of 'sex' and 'gender' in plants. Related information on modern classification of gender in plants and their morphology, can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_reproductive_morphology).  

  

With regards,

Prasad
