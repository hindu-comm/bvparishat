Not all plants have genders. Most plants are perfect, i.e. each of their flowers has both male and female reproductive parts. Some plants like maize are *monoecious*; they have separate male and female flowers but on the same plant. In maize, the top flower is male, others are female. Perfect and *monoecious* plants do not have a gender as every plant has perfect flowers or both male and female flowers. Only plants which are *dioecious* can be said to be of a specific gender as a plant has either male flowers or female flowers. Examples are date palms and wild papaya. In a *dioecious* plant, the physical appearance of male and female flowers is usually different, and can be used to tell a male plant from a female plant. The number of *dioecious* plants in the plant kingdom is relatively small.

  

Giloy or Guduchi (*Tinospora cordifolia*) is a *dioecious* plant. The following paper which documents the physical difference between male and female plants of this species and may be helpful:

P K Jha, M G Chauhan, T N Pandya (2009). Phytomorphological Differences of Male and Female Plants of Guduchi (Tinospora cordifolia (Willd.) Miers ex Hk.f. & Thom.), AYU, Volume 30, Issue 3, pp. 232-237. URL: <http://www.ayujournal.org/temp/Ayu303232-4470978_122509.pdf>

  

PS: Much of the above was explained to me over dinner today by my father Dr. J. B. Misra, a retired agricultural scientist from the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR).
