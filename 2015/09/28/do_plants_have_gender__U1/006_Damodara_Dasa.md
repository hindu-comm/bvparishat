Hare Krishna.  
  
I think the feminine portrait of Tulasi and the gender as discussed in  
scientific understanding are completely different. Is there something  
like male and female tulasi in modern scientific understanding? Nor is  
there something like male tulasi in vedic understanding.  
  
Thankyou,
