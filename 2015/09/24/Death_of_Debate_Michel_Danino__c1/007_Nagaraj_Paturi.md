Prof. Michel Danino:

Endlessly relayed by a controversy-hungry media, it has concealed the fact that the staunchest opponents of the theory have often been respected mainstream western academics. The British anthropologist Edmund Leach, the US bioanthropologist Kenneth AR Kennedy, the French archaeologist Jean-Paul Demoule, the US archaeologist Jim Shaffer, the Canadian historian Klaus Klostermaier, the Greek Sanskritist Nicholas Kazanas, the Italian linguist Angela Marcantonio, the Estonian biologist Toomas Kivisild, among others, have challenged the Aryan scenario in its Indian or Eurasian ramifications.

Prof. RN Iyengar:

On the other hand, those opposed to eurocentric/leftist history have no academically strong and scholarly evidences to support their arguments.

This observation by Prof. Iyengar is in contradiction with the scenario presented by Prof. Danino in the above mentioned words. 'respected mainstream western academics' listed by Prof. Danino can not be assumed to 'have no academically strong and scholarly evidences to support their arguments.'



It may be noted that a shift "from a “hard” version of an aggressive invasion to a “softer” one of a peaceful migration of small numbers" (-Prof. Danino)would not have been possible but for the 'academically strong and scholarly evidences to support their arguments.' presented by the scholars opposed to AIT.



Prof. Danino says:

How could Laurie Patton and Edwin Bryant have ' included papers by a few scholars on both sides who did critique each other courteously and in a scholarly fashion', if 'those opposed to eurocentric/leftist history have no academically strong and scholarly evidences to support their arguments' ?
