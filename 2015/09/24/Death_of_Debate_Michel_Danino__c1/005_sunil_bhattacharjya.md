Yes, this is an excellent article by Prof. Danino. Some Indian scholars have contested the Aryan Invasion theory or even its modified version - the Aryan migration theory, but pathetically there is no concerted effort. One can see the clamour for one-up-ness among the scholars everywhere. Instead of offering constructing support there is mostly destructive criticisms. In one of the discussions, one scholar went to the extent of calling another scholar, a mole, just because the latter did not agree with the former's date of the Mahabharata war. When coming to the issue of one important milestone of ancient Indian history, i.e., the date of the Mahabharata war, there are so many dates floating around and the scholars refuse to discuss the differences among themselves, forgetting that there can be only one date and not multiple dates from around 12th century BCE to around 32nd century BCE. The same applies to the traditional date of 3102 BCE as the start of the Kali yuga, where most people forget that this date has historical importance, which has been recognized by the scholars of past, when they gave the relation "Start of Saka kala = 3179 of Kali era".
