Dear Prof. Michel Danino,  

  

The power of 'real' intellectual debate is well argued through various examples from tradition. There is no place for 'vAda' now, it is only 'vitaNDA' everywhere. You provided a good list of western scholars who think logical about AIT and Sarasvati river issue. References to temple at Ayodhya, plagiarism allegations on Rajeev Malhotra, mudslinging on ICHR decisions, a beautiful historical example of 'reddification' of academic institutions in 1970's, and autonomy of educational institutions offers a great food for thought.  
  

Your comment \<*I stand in favour of true autonomy, but an autonomy founded on real intellectual freedom and excellence, not on convenient political leanings.*\> points to such incidents happened in the dreadful past in examples of Subramanian Swamy. He mentioned in one of his speeches - he devised a new Indian sustainable economic model for India during Indira Gandhi's regime which was trashed by the very powerful lady, fearing that a true nationalism may arise due to this. Subsequently, Mr. Swamy was dismissed from the service of his teaching at IIT. It is a different issue that he now won the case after so many decades (and going to get all of his arrears).  

  

Indeed, it is a bold attempt to present the realities through your article. We expect more such attempts from your pen.  
  

Thanks,  

Prasad
