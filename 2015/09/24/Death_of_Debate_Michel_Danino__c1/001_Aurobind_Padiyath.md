Well presented. Today the word debate is only considered to disprove the point under consideration. Gone are the days when both sides were given equal opportunities and time without getting the modarator involved or taking sides. Universities and other platforms do not encourage such practice any more. Nor the four pillars of Hindu matas of Sankaracharya. Media is under corporate world and they have clear mandate. They invite only to meet those ultirior interests of their owners. The genuine seeker never gets to find out the truth.
