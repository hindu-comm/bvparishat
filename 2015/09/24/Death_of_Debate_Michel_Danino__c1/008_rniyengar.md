Dear Sir,

My intention was not to contradict my good friend Michel, but if it sounded like that, I don’t mind correcting my statement as “ On the other hand, those opposed to eurocentric/leftist history *in universities, learned institutions, private and government agencies in India,* have no academically strong and scholarly evidences to support their arguments.”



Prof.Danino has the advantage of a 360 degree vision covering India and Europe, whereas mine is nearsighted. I have great regard for his vast knowledge about ancient India. So when I read the list of 'respected mainstream western academics', it rang a bell in my mind that the “Indian Academics” is a null set.



You wrote:****

*It may be noted that a shift "from a “hard” version of an aggressive invasion to a “softer” one of a peaceful migration of small numbers" (-Prof. Danino)would not have been possible but for the 'academically strong and scholarly evidences to support their arguments.' presented by the scholars opposed to AIT.*



I agree, all the above are facts, but who is fighting the Aryan battle for whom? Bargaining from “hard” to “soft” may be alright in getting a project sponsored in a university. But when my own house is being dismembered, dismantled and also repaired by a few who make a living out of such work, I feel disturbed to put it mildly. If people within the subcontinent are indifferent to such a situation the very roots of Indian culture could get chewed bit by bit. That is why, without sounding xenophobic, I prefaced my post by saying: “..strong scholarly groups internal to the culture and ethos..”should work on Indian history.



Thanks for keeping the debate alive, which serves the purpose of the media article of Prof. Danino, very well.

Kind regards

RNI
