\>If people within the subcontinent are indifferent to such a situation the very roots of Indian culture could get chewed bit by bit. That is why, without sounding xenophobic, I prefaced my post by saying: “..strong scholarly groups internal to the culture and ethos..”should work on Indian history.



- Iam completely with you and your ideas perfectly resonate with mine in saying 'strong scholarly groups internal to the culture and ethos..”should work on Indian history.'



In your comment you said:

"Hopefully, the reformed ICHR will show the way to sharpen new tools and vocabulary of discourse "

I am with you in this too.



Butwhat prompted me to respondto your comment was yourstatement 'On the other hand, those opposed to eurocentric/leftist history have no academically strong and scholarly evidences to support their arguments.'



Showed the entirevaada/ prativaada or paksha/pratipaksha to the vaada or paksha of AIT as weak.



Now you corrected your statement to



"On the other hand, those opposed to eurocentric/leftist history *in universities, learned institutions, private and government agencies in India,* have no academically strong and scholarly evidences to support their arguments.”



Even this corrected version has words such as 'no academically strong and scholarly evidences to support their arguments', which (1) show the vaada rather than the vaadis as weak and (2) are sweeping in nature.



Sweeping in nature because not all of those opposed to eurocentric/leftist history *in universities, learned institutions, private and government agencies in India* so weak in their evidences and/or arguments.



One thing is true. The quantity not the qualityof those opposed to eurocentric/leftist history *in universities, learned institutions, private and government agencies in India*is weak. It is a scenario world over and it is part of the modernity project itself that scholars inuniversities and other educational institutes who are anti-traditional, anti-religious etc. are larger in number than those who are otherwise. As part of this scenario, in India too most of the scholars inuniversities and other educational institutes particularly in social sciences anti-traditional, anti-religious etc.



But to say that all the Indian scholars opposing AIT, though smaller in number than those in favour of that theory have no academically strong and scholarly evidences to support their arguments is an over-generalization.



I shallcite examples of strong evidences and argumentsby Indian scholars in my next post.



Warm regards,



Nagaraj
