I wonder why the four main Sankaracharya Mathas have to be dragged into every such issue. Their prime goal is or should be to sustain the traditional culture of nivRtti dharma and saMnyAsa in a world that is rapidly changing around them, but they are operating under very trying circumstances.

  

The stark social and cultural reality is as follows. In my estimate, the Dwaraka Matha has just enough material and people resources to exist and is doing what it can. Jyoritmath was revived only in the year 1953, but there is a messy succession controversy going on now, which is not going to go away for a long time. If you are not aware of the details, please see the Indology list's website for a detailed review of that problem written by me years ago (<http://indology.info/papers/>). There is supposedly a recent court verdict that has come out, but that is really neither here nor there. The Puri Matha barely has resources to function on a daily basis. I hope you have been following the recent news over the goings on at the Jagannatha temple administration and the state government of Orissa, that adversely affect this Matha all the time. Adding to that, there is an impostor claiming the Puri title, called Adhokshajananda Tirtha, who is propped up by politicians of a certain kind and who enjoys great bonhomie with separatist Kashmir Hurriyat leaders. These complications really do not promote any kind of intellectual culture to flourish, do they?

  

Sringeri has maintained its strong culture of SAstra adhyayana and adhyApana. There are any number of resources online that you can research to find out what they do on a regular basis, starting from Veda recitation to traditional assemblies of expertpaNDita-s on vedAnta, nyAya, mImAMsA and vyAkaraNa. As I write this, there is an annual vidvat sadas going on in Sringeri. Of course, you can't expect seminars and conferences in modern university style at a traditional center of learning, but really, whose fault is that? The institution or the larger Indian society that is utterly failing such traditional institutions? And really, it should not be their business to host debates or discussions on such things as Aryan/Dravidian theories, Aurangazeb's or Tipu Sultan's exploits and such, should it? Why should a traditional Matha demean itself by offering its premises for yet another round of the mud-slinging matches that pass for debate on such issues in India today?

  

Other advaita vedAnta institutions in the south are also doing what they can. The Kanchi Matha and its activities are well known, but lesser known institutions like the Sivaganga Matha are also doing their bit to safeguard the traditional culture of SAstra learning and discussion. The Adhyatma Prakasa Karyalaya in Holenarsipur is yet another newer, but less known institution in this field, which organizes vidvad-goshthis regularly. Every such institution is doing its best within the resources available to it.

  

Finally, while talking about what the Sankaracharya Mathas are NOT doing, why not mention the traditional institutions of other Sampradayas as well, in the same breath? Don't mistake me as asking you to criticize them as well, Rather, my contention is that they are also doing their bit. The Madhva matha in Pejawar has newer initiatives like the Purnaprajna Vidyapeetha and the Ramananda Sampradaya in north India is setting up various centers of learning. And then we have institutions like the Ramakrishna Math, Chinmaya mission, Arsha Vidya Gurukulam etc, derived from the more traditional Sankaracharya tradition, who are all trying to do great things under what are largely quite unfavorable circumstances in Indian society.

  

If there is any hope of reorienting the larger Indian intellectual culture back to be consonant with an ancient past, it will have to come from such institutions, but it is going to take a lot of time and effort to find the right blend of the old and the new that will work in today's India. We have scholars on this very list who are associated with various institutions in this spectrum, directly or indirectly, who can speak to this better than I can. In the meantime, we should be thankful that the old traditional institutions are preserving the old, so that there will continue to be something out there, in order to blend with the new.

  

Frankly, it is getting more than a little irritating to see the Sankaracharya Mathas being singled out for some sort of criticism whenever such a topic arises. I expect this out of the so-called mainstream media in India. I am very disappointed that it arises similarly, time and again, on this forum. I assumed, wrongly, that everybody on this forum has a better sensitivity than this to the ground realities operating in India today.

  

Best regards,

Vidyasankar
