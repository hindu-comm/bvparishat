Dear friends,  
  

Numerous evidences are not needed to settle any issue. Even a single or a couple of good solid evidences can settle an issue. My paper on Dotted Record had subdued the mighty people like Michel Witzel and Romila Thapar. They have no answer.  
  

Just take the following case. The people like Romila Thapara advances the argument that Harahvati in Afghanistan is the Sasarwati. Firstly Max mMler, the father of the "Aryan Invasion Theory" or AIT (though the honest prof. Max Muller, of his own volition, himself retracted later on from his own stand on AIT) vhought the Kabul river (which is a tributary of the rive Sindr), to be the Saraswati. I asked Romila Thapar that Sarasvati of India became Harahvati in Afghanistan,why Hotra in Afghanistan is not Sotra in India. Moreover The Vedic Saraswati flowed to the Sea but Harahvati does not flow to the sea.  
  

Less said the better about the honesty of the protagonists of the AIT .  
  

Regards,
