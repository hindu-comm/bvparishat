You said it, Prof. Danino, as always.



But let me tell you why the 'left' gets so restless when its stand is questioned, challenged , counter-argued, counter-exemplified etc.



\(1\) There is a proverb in Telugu: 'Make a marriage happen, no matter if it means telling athousand lies'. Ideologically mad persons of all strands, particularly I have seen this in the 'left', believe in this approach to bringing in what they consider to be the future heaven, a system that brings justice to the sections so far exploited. All the intellectual endeavour and expression of a 'progressive' person must contribute to the attainment of this future state of affairs, even if it means hiding or twisting facts. Once when I gave a lecture on ancient Indian achievements in science to a group of brilliant post-graduate university students on their persistent requests, aUS educated 'left'professor who attended the talk, said, " I see that most of your evidences and arguments are impeccable. But do you think it is appropriate to bring out all such things at this stage of history? We should check which class is helped by this information" .



The proverb I quoted is just a proverb. Proverbs are not a consistent system of knowledge. For example, this proverb, if blindly followed, has many dangerous implications for the happy life of the married couple and the kin that love them. Once it is realized that the great act of lying was all done for a dangerous consequence, it would have been too late.



Similarly, the future 'heaven' for which all this information manipulation and knowledge engineering is resorted to by the 'progressive' is going to turn out to be 'hell', then can anyone turn back the clock?



\(2\) Dictatorship of a single thought, though is given thenot so revealing name of 'proletariat dictatorship', is seriously believed in by the 'left' intellectuals. Thus for them, controlling what should be made known to people, or what peopleshould know is not wrong. They could successfully implement their left intellectual dictatorship through the support from the erstwhile regimes whichwere or pretended to be left leaning at least strategic political reasons ( the main reason being hijacking the agenda of the then strong opposition to weaken it). They are now turning restless as they see that their erstwhile dictatorial control on the knowledge fieldsis crumbling. All the 'educated' trained under that regime are also feeling restless because all the interpretations that they accepted as facts are now being exposed to be interpretations and alternative interpretations andfacts in support of themare being brought to light.



The biggest irony is that all thesedictatorially oriented groups cry in the name of democracy.
