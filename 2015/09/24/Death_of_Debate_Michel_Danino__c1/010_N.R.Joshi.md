Afghanistan Harahati has nothing to do with Indian Sarasvati. Who says that there has to be one Sarasvati in that part of the world? The name of the country Croasia is H'Rat (Harahati -Sarasvati). The river names in Lithuania are Indian river names. Ladies kingdom was outside of the Indian subcontinent. Indo-Aryan was spoken in Finland-See Koenraad Elst paper. Why to talk only partial picture of the ancient history of Mahabharat, let us talk full picture. What about Mitanni, Hittite civilization, Hurrian temples of goddess and governorAbdi-kheba of that region. Thanks .N.R.Joshi
