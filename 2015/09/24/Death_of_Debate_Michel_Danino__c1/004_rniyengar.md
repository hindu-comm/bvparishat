Excellent article. It may be worthwhile to look at possible solutions also. It is imperative there should be strong scholarly groups internal to the culture and ethos of India work on "History of India" without bias of the leftist or of the rightist kind. On the web site of the article I posted the following comment: 

  

Well articulated article, congratulations!

I like to add that there is considerable asymmetry between the opponents. Those who argue for AIT and the like, have well developed tools to argue and evidences to present. They have nurtured a "school" so to say. On the other hand, those opposed to eurocentric/leftist history have no academically strong and scholarly evidences to support their arguments. They are scattered here and there, much of the time fighting among themselves. They are mostly emotional and unable to withstand dissenting views. Hopefully, the reformed ICHR will show the way to sharpen new tools and vocabulary of discourse leaving aside the PuraNic kalpa, manvantara,... 28th-Kaliyuga starting in 3102 BC as an argument of Indo-centric history. (No offence meant to any one!)
