David B. Zilberman writes:  
  

"The methodological affinity between yoga and modern science can be easily demonstrated. Let us take a closer look at the method of symbolic construction practiced in modern physics. First introduced in the West by Galileo, it is similar to what in Indian yoga was known and systematically used at least from the sixth century B.C. as the strategy of \`divided construction' (vikalpa)."  
(page 11, The Birth of Meaning in Hindu Thought, Edited by Robert S. Cohen, D. Reidel Publishing Company)  

  

Note: A simple example of "symbolic construction" would be resolution of velocity of a moving body on a inclined plane along horizontal and vertical axes.  

  
The scholars are invited to comment on Zilberman's assertion.
