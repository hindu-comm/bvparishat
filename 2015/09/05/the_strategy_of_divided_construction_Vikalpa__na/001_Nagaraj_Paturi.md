Thanks Prof. Vineet Chaitanya, for bringing in positive vibes by bringing inan excellent example of a western scholar understanding Indian notions with such a perceptive and incisive approach.



Sad to know that such a sukshmagrahi lived only for 39 years (1938-77).



There are many other such methodological tools of the ancient Indians similar to vikalpa (in the sense of symbolic construction), that deserve attention such as apOddhAra (e.g. in vAkyapadIyam), anvaya-vyatireka ( in vyAkaraNa, Vedanta etc. ).



Vikalpa itself has been used in this sense (among other senses) in vAkyapadIyam too.
