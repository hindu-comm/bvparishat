N.S. 1.1.7 *āptopadeśaḥ śabdaḥ* defines śabda as a means of right knowledge but its complexities in the context of human understanding comes much later. For the mature Naiyāyika view see Jagadīśa’s Sabdaśaktiprakāśikā. This has been translated into English but it is advisable that only the original or late Kamaleswar Bhattacharya’s translation (partial) is consulted.

Kamaleswar Bhattacharya had been working (French) on Jagadīśa and the pre-Jagadīśa Naiyāyika history of the śābdabodha. In our last communication he did not confirm the completion of his work.
