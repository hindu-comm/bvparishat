Dear Sunderji,  
Your zeal is commendable. But I hope you have a good knowledge of the preliminaries of Navyanyaya which is absolutely necessary. Otherwise you may try practising writing *siddhaantas* following the Tarkasangraha. Then you shall require a good teacher. None of my teachers in Navyanyaaya are anymore in the world. The last one was Shiva Chandra Nyaayaacharya, s/o Mm. Vaamaacharana Nyayaachaarya. Shivachandra breathed his last in 1995.  

Now to find a good teacher is difficult and one has to be careful in word and deed. Where do you live? If you live near Varanasi you could contact Pandit Ganeshwar Shastri, s/o late Rajeshwar Shastri. I often saw him coming to my own teacher and discussing things with him.  

Best wishes  

Yours  

Dipak Bhattacharya
