Namaste

This is to gently re-request the scholars of my query about any commentary available for Nilakantha Dikshita's Gangavataranam.

DLI and archive- both were searched, but just the mUlam was got. No commentary or notes kind of thing.

If anyone is aware of any such work, please let me know. This is for help of a junior of mine, who is doing PhD on this kAvya.
