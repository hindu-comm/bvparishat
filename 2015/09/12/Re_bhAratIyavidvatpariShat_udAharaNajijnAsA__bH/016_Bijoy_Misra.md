Dear friends,  

A poet's use of a word and its context is more important than what we have to strictly code.  

There is a philosophical basis that a language is an expression.
Grammar is a template for  

such expression and at best is a guide. Panini has codified most known contexts available  

to him at the time of his composition. We have to be open for more intelligent applications  

as we proceed with the new sciences and new understanding. क्रीड् is a good example.  

"play with mind" is different than "play with a ball". More such ambiguities would arise  

as we move forward. Let it be left to the मीमांसा scholars.  

If God is within, whom do I offer my worship?  

Best regards,  

BM
