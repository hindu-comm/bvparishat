I find a battle of words quite too often. I feel no two scholars view will be identical. If a member is posting a different view it should be taken in the right spirit.Who is correct and who is wrong is best left to the readers. There will never be an absolute right or absolute wrong. Please desist from making additional remarks. Please make one or 2 posts per thread which will cover the points or views you wish to convey Thanks
