vAlmIki is not just a s'ishTa, but a rishi, a class apart. prayOga by rishi is called Arsha. The word ArshaprayOga is used to specifically to indicate that (I) it is an exception to the rule (ii) it is not to be imitated by common users. The following by Hari seems to be toindicate the exceptionality of the ArshaprayOgas only:
