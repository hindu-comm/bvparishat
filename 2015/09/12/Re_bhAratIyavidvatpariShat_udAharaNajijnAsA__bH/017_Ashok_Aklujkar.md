I do not see any reason to doubt that the form krīḍate occurs in the Līlāvatī of Bhāskarācārya. Enough has already been written on how to justify its sādhutva and/or pāṇinīyatva. So that is also the matter into which I do not wish to enter here.

  

I wish to point out a chronological problem.

I just wish to ensure that the cautiously made assertion (note HPD’s employment of “seems”) does not mislead subsequent discussion.

  

Śaraṇa-deva lived around Śaka 1095 or 1172 A.D, the year he mentions for the composition of his Durghaṭa-vṛtti. Bhāskarācārya is said to have been born in 1114 A.D. Even if one assumes thatBhāskarācārya became famous very early in his life, one cannot proceed confidently on the assumption that it isBhāskarācārya whomŚaraṇa-deva has quoted. The temporal distance between the two would be too small for claiming with certainty thatBhāskarācārya’s work reached(the probably physically distant) Śaraṇa-deva in what were troubled times in northern India.

  

Secondly and more importantly, there is a significant difference between sallakyā yaṣṭi-bhāgasvanavanasahitaḥ \[= ?\] krīḍate nāga-rājaḥ, the verse quarterquoted in the Durghaṭa-vṛtti, and padminyāṁ cāṣṭamāṁśaḥ sva-navama-sahitaḥ krīḍate sānurāgaḥ, the verse quarter found in the Līlāvatī. Even if one emendsyaṣṭi-bhāgasvanavana-saª toaṣṭa-bhāgaḥ sva-navama-saª, to get some plausible sense out of the beginning ofŚaraṇa-deva’s citation and to make it agree with the sequence (6-7)-8-9 seen inBhāskarācārya’s verse, the difference in the first word and the last word of the quoted quarter will still be there staring at us. It could not have come about through some scribal error. It must be due to a deliberate change. 

  

The simplest and, therefore, the most natural way to explain the situation would be to abandon the idea that Śaraṇa-deva was quotingBhāskarācārya. He probablyhad access to a verse in an older work on mathematics, andBhāskarācārya reworked a part of the same or very similar verse to form his example, without getting worked up about its non-conformity with the common usage of krīḍ in the parasmai-pada or with what Pāṇini seemed to sanction.

  

There could even have been a convention of giving greater freedom from a revered grammar to those śāstra authors who were constrained by the more relevant/pressing needs of their particular disciplines (such as mentioning numbers or factors in a particular sequence in examples needed to facilitate students’ learning of the specific śāstra). Cf. the subhāṣita:

vaiyākaraṇa-kirātād apaśabda-mṛgāḥ kva yānti saṁtrastāḥ /

jyotir-naṭa-viṭa-gāyaka-bhiṣag-ānana-gahvarāṇi yadi na syuḥ //

  

a.a.
