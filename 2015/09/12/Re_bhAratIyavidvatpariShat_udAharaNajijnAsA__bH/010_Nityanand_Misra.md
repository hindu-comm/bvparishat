The context in the entire thread is surely Pāṇinian, right? We are discussing Pāṇinian rules and derivation, not any other grammar. It is in this context that I said*krīḍate* is *asādhu*. The same is the conclusion in the last statement of the commentary you copy-pasted. Do we agree with this conclusion or not?

  

More importantly, do we follow Pāṇinian grammar rules or rules of some other grammar or exceptional non-Pāṇinian usages? Or does it depend on the situation for you?

  

Vālmīki’s case is different, his usage pre-dates Pāṇini. Either Vālmīki must have known an older grammar in which this form would have been sādhu, or he makes an exceptional usage. As Vālmīki is a śiṣṭa, we accept even his exceptional usage though it may be non-Pāṇinian.

  

Coming to 'ānukūlyena krīḍate,' that seems to be a modern usage by you (unless you quoted from somewhere). Do we know any other grammar in which this is *sādhu*, or do we consider ourselves to be śiṣṭa like Vālmīki? If answers to both is no, then the usage is to be deemed incorrect as learners like us are expected to follow Pāṇinian grammar. Defending anon-Pāṇinianusage by saying it is also correct as a śiṣṭa has made the same usage is just a lame attempt at justifying a mistake.

  

PS: Sivakumari Katuri Ji kindly pointed out that jijñāsāmi in the original post is not correct but jijñāse is due to jñā-śru-smṛ-dṛśāṃ sanaḥ. Vinayaka Rajay Ji happily accepted. Fortunately, not everybody tries to justify mistakes.
