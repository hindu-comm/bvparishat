One has to visit any temple or historical monument in India to plainly see how the edifice of Islam was literally built on the ruins of temples. The Qutb Minar comex in Delhi shows how the Muslim kings built their mosques etc. with material salvaged from Hindu temples. In Hyderabad when we go to any major temple (Ganesh temple, Secunderabad: Jhamsingh temple, Mehidipatnam etc.) or in Telangana (Vemulavada temple of Siva etc.) we see a mosque prominently positioned there. पश्यन्नपि न पश्यति!
