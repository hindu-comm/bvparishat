Dear Scholars  
  

Bringing to your notice a thesis, now published as book, that claims - Hindu religion and culture was never under attack during muslim rule in India.  

  
The book is titled "Culture of Encounters: Sanskrit at the Mughal Court, the book by Audrey Truschke, a leading (?) scholar of South Asian cultural and intellectual history, argues that the heyday of Muslim rule in India from the 16th to 18th centuries was, in fact, one of "tremendous cross-cultural respect and fertilisation and not religious or cultural conflict."  

news report on the book: <http://www.daijiworld.com/news/news_disp.asp?n_id=352863>

Jayaraman
