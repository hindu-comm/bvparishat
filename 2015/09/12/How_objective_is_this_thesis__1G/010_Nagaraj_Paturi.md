1\. In the interview, the postdoctoral fellow (a lucky one, how many postdoctoral fellows get such an attention, unless they can dare project a non-news to be news as in this case) says,

>

Akbar’s reputation is that he was open-minded > and tolerant, almost a protosecular figure. This can be a misleading > characterisation.

Akbar > also had no qualms about harshly judging perspectives that he viewed > as beyond the pale. A good example is that he questioned Jain thinkers > about whether they were monotheists because to be otherwise would mean > being evicted from the Mughal court (Jains assured him that they > believed in God)." >

This is what many who have been branded as right wing historians have been saying about Akbar. They were chided for attempting to erase 'Akbar’s reputation that he was open-minded and tolerant, almost a protosecular figure'. Well before thisresearcher, those historians too said,'This can be a misleading characterisation'.



2.Even the Aurangazeb point that is highlighted through the main title " Aurangazeb is a severely misunderstood figure", or through the boxed quote"His was a political decision, rather than as a cultural or religious judgement" does not say anything new about the actions by Aurangazeb;it attempts an analysis of the motivation for the action. These 'motivation analyses' are always debatable, since except the motivated no one else in fact knows the motivation. But if the analysis is assumed to be valid, in what way does it matter? Most of the harm done by the British to Indian culture wasalso politically motivated;but that does not compel one to say 'there was no harm doneby them to Indian culture'. 



3\. The interview begins with the sentence, 'The present Bharatiya Janata Party government believes Mughals are not part of India’s history.'. I do not know where the present Bharatiya Janata Party governmentsaid Mughals are not part of India’s history.But if one says that 'Mughals harmed India', they can not be construed to be saying, 'Mughals are not part of Indian history'.They can not be construed to be 'erasing Mughals from Indian history'. In fact, those who say 'A harmed me in the in the past, in fact strongly prevent erasing A from history'.



4\. The second sentence is 'Your book is about how Sanskrit, sought to be made mainstream by the government, flourished under the Mughals'. This delineates the special focus on Sanskrit. Let us not digress into attacks on structures, sculptures etc.



5\. The words of the intervieweethat might have disappointed the Marxistsympathisers/friends of the 'perspective' are:



> 
> > Marxist history is limiting, in my opinion. This strain of thought > tends to emphasise social class and economic factors in determining > historical trajectories. Modern historians have a much wider range of > approaches at their disposal that better situate us to understand > other aspects of the past.
> > 
> > 
> > 
> > 

Yes, 'modern historians have a much wider range of approaches at their disposal that better situate us to understand other aspects of the past' than those expressed in these unduly hyped works.
