1\. That our cultural forms such as classical music, classical dance etc. have significant share of influence of Mughal rule is well recognized and there is no need of any new discovery about it. That many Hindus including some Rajput kings had good positive relations with Akbar and/or other Mughal rulersis not a news at all. Folk tales of Akbar and Birbal also give a picture of such good relations though no one believes that such tales are historical facts. If the focus is on Sanskrit writers, it should be noted thatit was or is never believed that all Sanskrit scholars were anti-establishment or politically oriented or rebellious towards the rulers on account of their religious affiliation or their attitude or behaviour towardsother members of their religion. Though some of the Sanskrit scholars were anti-establishment or rebellious, many thought politics was not their cup of tea and as long as their academic life was not disturbed by the ruler, they tried to have cordial relations with the kings irrespective of their religious affiliation. This was true of a good number of Sanskrit scholars during the British rule too. This situation is known to people as a common sense. Thus there is no poorvapaksha being countered in finding that some Sanskrit scholars had good relations with the Mughal rulers.



2\. The Sanskrit literature reflecting the good relations of the Sanskrit scholars with Mughals can not convince those who would like to focus on theharm caused by Mughal rulers tocertain aspects of Indian culture or 'Hindu' culture or 'Hindu', Jain, or other non-Moslem religious groups and their individual members.It is simply brushed aside as the literature by either 'the gullible' or the self-centred individuals who are present in every society at all times.



3. If the concern of anyone is for the harmonious relations between the Hindus and the Moslems of the present day India, and the apprehension is that focusing on the past conflicts during the Mughal rule,it is better to focus on educating people about the facts that (I) the relation between the present day IndianMoslemsand the Mughal rulers is only a bAdarAyaNa relation imagined as connected through religion. (ii) Any attitude of antagonism towards present day Indian Moslems irrespective of their Indian nationalism or patriotism towards India, developing through the study of such conflicts is irrational and unhealthy.
