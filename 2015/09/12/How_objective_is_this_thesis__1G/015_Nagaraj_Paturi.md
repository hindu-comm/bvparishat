under #3 in my previous post :



add to 'and the apprehension is that focusing on the past conflicts during the Mughal rule' 'can harm such harmonious relations'



3. If the concern of anyone is for the harmonious relations between the Hindus and the Moslems of the present day India, and the apprehension is that focusing on the past conflicts during the Mughal rule 'can harm such harmonious relations',it is better to focus on educating people about the facts that (I) the relation between the present day IndianMoslemsand the Mughal rulers is only a bAdarAyaNa relation imagined as connected through religion. (ii) Any attitude of antagonism towards present day Indian Moslems irrespective of their Indian nationalism or patriotism towards India, developing through the study of such conflicts is irrational and unhealthy.
