hariH OM,

 This again is another example of the whitewashing of the medieval Islamic excesses in India in a purported exercise of nuancing the discourse about the Hindu colonial experience. One just needs to read the books written by the Islamic kings themselves or those written with their approval.

For the analysis with copious references to original Persian / Arabic texts, one may read the books written by Kishori Sharan Lal:

<https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._S._Lal>

 Specifically:  
1. Theory and practice of the Muslim State in India.  
2. Indian Muslims, who are they?  
3. The Mughal Harem.  
4. Growth of Scheduled Tribes and Castes in Medieval India.

 A few of his other books are available in the following website:

 It is another matter that any colonial force will always co opt natives for complete domination of the people. (as for example Todar Mal with Akbar or the British co-opting higher castes into administration and the so called "martial races" into the British Indian Army) To call this as some great encouragement to the indigenous culture etc. is ethical and moral bankruptcy. This is akin (not same but similar) to the British claiming that the colonial exercise was the white man's burden to civilize the heathens.

We can always find subtle nuances in the discourse of even Hafiz Sayeed or the late Hamid Gul (the latter was extremely well read and I have never seen him too flustered in any interview). But that will not make them any less evil.

svasti,  
 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,  
 shrivathsa.
