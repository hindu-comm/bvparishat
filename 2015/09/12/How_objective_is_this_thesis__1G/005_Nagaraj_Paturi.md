The thesis that "there was no conflict at all" as reported in the newspaper as thesis of the Researcher



and



the thesis that "there was only conflict"



are both extremes and exaggerations.



Some Sanskrit scholars having a no conflict relation with some of the Mughal kings is not a news as is being attempted to be made out by the news paper or if his report is right, by the researcher.



Jagannatha Pandita is a glaring example for Sanskrit scholarsbeing patronized bythe Mughal kings. With good number of examples of that kind are well known. Thus the point being made by the researcher about some such relations is not a news at all.



The researcher is only adding new examplesin the form of previously notknownmanuscripts to the already well discussed thesis of some Sanskrit scholars having a no conflict relation with some of the Mughal kings.



Her Academia articles do not have the exaggerations or sweeping remarks that are reported in the news paperto have been made by her in her new book.
