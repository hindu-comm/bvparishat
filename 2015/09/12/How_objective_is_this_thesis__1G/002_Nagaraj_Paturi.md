As aadaraNIya Nityanandji cautioned earlier, we have to be careful about press reports:



I bookmarked and downloaded some of her papers a few days ago.

[Contested History: Brahmanical Memories of Relations with the Mughals](https://www.academia.edu/15016307/Contested_History_Brahmanical_Memories_of_Relations_with_the_Mughals)



Brahman Sanskrit intellectuals enjoyed a century of relations with the Mughal elite. Nonetheless, such cross-cultural connections feature only sporadically in Persian chronicles, and Brahmans rarely elaborated on their imperial links in Sanskrit texts. In this essay I analyze a major exception to the Brahmanical silence on their Mughal connections, the Kavīndracandrodaya (“Moonrise of Kavīndra”). More than seventy Brahmans penned the poetry and prose of this Sanskrit work that celebrates Kavīndrācārya’s successful attempt to persuade Emperor Shah Jahan to rescind taxes on Hindu pilgrims to Benares and Prayag (Allahabad). I argue that the Kavīndracandrodaya constituted an act of selective remembrance in the Sanskrit tradition of cross-cultural encounters in Mughal India. This enshrined memory was, however, hardly a uniform vision. The work’s many authors demonstrate the limits and points of contestation among early moderns regarding how to formulate social and historical commentaries in Sanskrit on imperial relations.



For the paper



[Regional Perceptions: Writing to the Mughal Court in Sanskrit](https://www.academia.edu/13761581/Regional_Perceptions_Writing_to_the_Mughal_Court_in_Sanskrit)



From the 1580s to the 1640s, Jain and Brahman writers authored numerous Sanskrit praise poems addressed to members of the Mughal elite. In total, four authors dedicated seven full Sanskrit panegyrics to kings, princes, and members of the imperial administration during the reigns of Akbar through Shahjahan. In this essay, I introduce these virtually unknown texts and analyze the insights such materials provide regarding regional perceptions of high Mughal culture and how individuals and communities participated in creating Mughal cosmopolitanism. All four authors wrote at the instigation of regional rulers or religious communities that sought to negotiate their political relationship with the imperial center. In large part, these authors and their patrons were responding to the sustained Mughal interest in translating Sanskrit works and supporting Sanskrit textual production. Sanskrit encomia are an untold part of the larger story of Mughal cross-cultural interests and demonstrate how a variety of Indians envisioned the Mughal ruling class as open to engaging with Sanskrit literature. Through these works, Jain and Brahman authors proclaim a political place for Sanskrit in the Mughal imperium and, more specifically, a cultural space for Sanskrit aesthetics.
