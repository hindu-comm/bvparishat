Thanks Prof. Prasad Ji for the link to The Hindu article. I find the language of the questions to be blatantly one-sided. The interviewer appears to be more biased than the interviewee. Some of the questions remind me of the kind of questions Nidhi Razdan asked her \[in\]famous interview of British Member of Parliament Barry Gardiner.

  

“The present Bharatiya Janata Party government believes Mughals are not part of India’s history.”

An opinion presented as if it were a fact. Has the government said this officially or is the interviewer deducing this?

  

“the present government fights to push Sanskrit into mainstream discourse”

Is bringing up something in a discourse also problematic? In a democracy?

  

“such as what took place in the 2002 pogrom, in which more than 1,000 Muslims died”

Fact-check: 790 Muslims and 254 Hindus died and 223 went missing as per statement made by UPA minister Sriprakash Jaiswal in the Rajya Sabha in 2005. Source: [BBC article here](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4536199.stm). Exaggeration of numbers and selective suppression of facts that Hindus also died.

  

“or the current intolerance towards them”

Again, an opinion presented as if it were a fact.

  

“erases Mughal history and writes religious conflicts into Indian history where there was none, thereby justifying modern religious intolerance”

Opinion presented as a fact yet again. Has the ICHR under the government officially revised any history books where Mughal history is erased and religious conflict inserted?

  

“the Hindu nationalist imagination”

Leftist perceptions are facts, Hindu nationalist perceptions are just imagination?

  

“there is a wave of revisionism in India”

The media expertise at detecting waves is well-known. These are the people who denied a Modi wave before 2014 elections. [Here](http://www.theunrealtimes.com/2013/12/08/narendra-modi-strikes-a-tuning-fork-into-vibrations-congress-says-no-modi-wave/) is a satirical take on it.
