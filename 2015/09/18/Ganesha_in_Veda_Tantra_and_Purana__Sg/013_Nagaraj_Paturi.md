This state or plane of experience is called as 'mythical state of consciousness' by the western philosophers and literary critics; particularly the neo-Kantians. But influenced by evolutionism as they were exchange the phrase with 'primitive state of :consciousness'. ButMatsyapurana,Vakyapadiyam etc. discuss the process of vEdamantradars'anaand discuss this as the Brahmarshi sthiti of chaitanya. Vakyapadiyam uses words such as 'avibhAga', 'svapnavat' etc.
