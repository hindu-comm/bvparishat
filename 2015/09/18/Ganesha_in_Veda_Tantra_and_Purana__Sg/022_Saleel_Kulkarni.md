Namo namah.

The letters of scholars Prof. Korada and Shri. Bhatt prompted me to write this note.

Prof. Korada said,

{{गणानां त्वा गणपतिग्ं हवामहे - **is not about गणेश **।}}

Shri. Bhatt says,

{{**विघ्नेश देव **गणेश के सन्दर्भ वेद, पुराणादि में कहाँ कहाँ पर मिल रहे हैं - इस विषय की विद्याकीय जिज्ञासा स्पृहणीय है । आवश्यक भी है ।}}

{{पुराणादि ग्रन्थों में वह देवता **कहाँ पर प्रथम बार उल्लिखित** होते है, वह ढूँढने के बाद, अनुगामी काल में गणेश से सम्बद्ध **विविध मिथक कैसे विकसित होते गये****, **एवमेव उनकी विविध स्तुतियाँ कैसे प्रसिद्ध होने लगी, यह एक **रसप्रद सर्वेक्षण** सिद्ध होगा ।।}}

Most of the expectations expressed by Shri. Bhatt have been fulfilled in a survey/commentary written by the late Prof. मा० ना० आचार्य, in one of his research articles. I have attached a copy of that Marathi article to this email. While presenting a translation of the entire article would be a difficult task, I am presenting below a few of the statements made in the article. The scholars in this परिषद्‌ may kindly present their views on the same.

1. The title of the article is "देवा तूं चि गणेशु...", which is a phrase/sentence mentioned in the मंगलाचरण pronounced at the beginning of ज्ञानदेवी (ज्ञानेश्वरी), a detailed commentary on Bhagawadgita by संत ज्ञानेश्वर. The present article endeavours to explore the गणेश that is described in ज्ञानदेवी.

2. The गणेश दैवत has evolved through blending/mixing of cultural traditions (संस्कृतिसमन्वय). It may not be possible to accurately follow the relative historical developments. But it is possible to take note of some distinct stages of the development. The गणेश दैवत originally belonged to the अनार्य यक्षसृष्टि. Later it was tied up with (related to) ब्रह्मणस्पति in the ऋग्वेद. The daivata that was originally related to विनायक belonging to the world of विघ्नदैवत-s, subsequently became a विघ्ननाशक दैवत. Then it became a part of the सगुण उपासना and even व्रतवैकल्य-s.

3. In ऋग्वेद the धातु 'यक्ष्‌' means 'to worship' (यक्ष पूजायाम्‌) (RV 2.3.7, 5.70.4). But some linguists consider this to be originally a root belonging to some अनार्य भाषा. Later it got sanskritised. (म०वि०कोश० १४, Page 41-42). Among the अनार्य ग्रामदेवता-s, we still find the यक्ष and यक्षिणी in the form of यक्ख, जख्ख, जख्खमाता etc.

4. It appears that originally the यक्ष-s were विरूप and भयप्रद. In Mahabharata, युधिष्ठिर found the यक्ष to be विरूपाक्ष and महाकाय. But perhaps at times they also used to be सुरूप. दमयंती found नलराजा to be beautiful like a यक्ष. (वन. 55.17) In गणेश सहस्रनाम the गणेश is also called यक्ष and विरूपाक्ष.

5. गणेश is also called विघ्नेश, विघ्नराज etc. In लोकवाङ्मय such as कथासरित्सागर (11th century), बृहत्कथा (3rd century bc) we find विघ्नेश being worshipped to ward off evil. (In support some stories are narrated here.)

6. Like गणेश, the daivata शिव too originally belonged to the anArya-s. It got mixed/blended (समन्वित) with the rudra of the Vedas and became अधिकारी of हविर्द्रव्य in the वैदिक यज्ञयाग-s. The गणेश first became identical (एकरूप) to शिव and became the अधिपति of his गण-s. This process is apparent from the different suggestive stories in the पुराण-s.

7. The word गणपति is mentioned twice in ऋग्वेद. The reference in RV 10.112.9 is इंद्रवाचक. The other is in the famous सूक्त - "गणानां त्वा गणपतिं हवामहे..." (RV 2.23.1). Presently it forms a part of the आराधना of गणपति. But in ऋग्वेद, the मंत्रदेवता viz. ब्रह्मणस्पति is the गणपति. ब्रह्मन्‌ = मन्त्र. Here he is referred to as the गणपति meaning the स्वामी of मंत्रवाणी.

Here the word गण does not signify a troop (समूह). In the निघंटु the word गण is included in the वाणीवाचक wordgroup (शब्दगण). Even in grammar the word गण means a group of similar शब्द-s (meaning spoken words). In the same manner here in the RV ब्रह्मणस्पति is referred to as स्वामी of मन्त्रवाणी, and therefore a गणपति.

Later गणेश was considered as विद्याधिपति and got to be related to the ब्रह्मणस्पति.

8. The गणपत्यथर्वशीर्ष स्तोत्र which is now a part of regular गणपति-आराधना, was never a part of the original वेदसंहिता. अथर्वशीर्ष = the final part of अथर्ववेद. There are five such parts, विष्णु, शिव, देवी, सूर्य and गणपति are the names that form the पंचायतनपूजा. This उपासनापद्धति is relatively recent (6th century). अथर्वशीर्ष must have been added at the end after गणेश was included in the वैदिक देवतामंडल and became पूजनीय as a part of the पंचायतनपूजा. (Some information about the पंचायतनपूजा follows.)

9. Here the गँ in the गणेशमंत्र is related to ॐकार. ॐ is also referred to as प्रणव. (मुण्डक. २.२.४) But it has no mention in the RV. (Detailed discussion follows.)

10. Many stories/references from different श्रुति-स्मृति-पुराण-s related to the birth of गणेश are narrated and their similarities/consistencies and differences/inconsistencies are discussed.

11. At the beginning of the ज्ञानदेवी/ज्ञानेश्वरी grantha of संत ज्ञानेश्वर/ज्ञानदेव, there is गणेशवंदन. ज्ञानदेव salutes the आत्मस्वरूप which is वेदप्रतिपाद्य but स्वसंवेद्य, and which by itself is the गणेश. वाङ्मय has two branches, viz. शास्त्र and काव्य. शास्त्र is तर्कानुगामी शब्दप्रतिपाद्य, whereas काव्य is स्वसंवेद्य. ज्ञानदेव philosophically and from the point of view of the poetics, belonged to the शैव संप्रदाय. आनंदवर्धन and अभिनवगुप्त were its leading personalities. Here many similarities between the interpretations in ध्वन्यालोक as well as लोचन and in ज्ञानदेवी are discussed. And how those interpretations have been applied to the above रूपक of गणेश is discussed at length.

12. The subsequent pages are devoted to different aspects of the concept of गणेश and their evolution from the Vedic period to the recent times.

I look forward to comments from the vidwansah of this forum.

Those who can understand Marathi may read the original article attached hereto. The article is written in संस्कृतप्रचुर Marathi. So a little knowledge of Marathi may suffice. The entire book consists of various research articles.
