Some information to the thread from my side:

GaNapati known by his various names is described in the Skaanda PuraaNa-PrabhaasakhaNDa. As it happens in the Purana, the text is not always continuous. GaNapati (G) appears in at least 10 chapters, mostly in the form of Shiva-Paarvati (P) dialogue. I can post the original when I have some leisure. G was born out of the sweat of P, in one place. In another place P likes to paint and comes out with a figure without the head. She asks Skanda (Kaartikeya) to bring some material for further painting. But S brings an elephant head and that is how G was born. **He has to be propitiated by the Vedic GaNaanaam Tvaam...mantra.** Reason for the creation of G is quite interesting. It was to arrest the population of earthly people in the heavens! Irrespective of their caste and creed and gender people started worshiping the Linga in Prabhaasa and could easily attain Svarga. Vedic practices reduced on earth. Yama had very little work to do! So Shiva-Paarvati at the request of Devas, decided to put obstacles in the way of pilgrims to Prabhaasa and that job was assigned to Vighnaraaja! Only those who could propitiate him could know where Prabhaasa-linga is located, etc etc.
The reason for invoking and then immersing G in water appears to be due to his ferocious aspects.  Incidentally the two cults Kaumaara and GaaNapatya is said to have originated in the Arbuda region.

  

**My personal opinion is:** G is connected to the MarudgaNas of RV like Skanda/Kumaara is. Since Maruts are "Rudrasuunavah", the first born Kaartikeya is Devasenaani (Shaktidhara of MB) and G his younger brother is GaNaadhyaksha. All the three, Rudra, Skanda and G are personified celestial deities of the 'adhidaiva' interpretation.
