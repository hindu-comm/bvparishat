Looking at immersion of the clay idol as part of udvaasana is an interesting , useful and valid way of looking. Creating a graphic or plastic image as aavaahana and wiping off or dismantling the image as udvaasana is found widespread in folk, tantric and Vedic rituals of spirits and deities other than Ganesha too. Semiotics behind this seems to be bringing the abstract into visible, tangible form and undoing the process after the help/aid for concreteness (graphic or plastic image)is utilizedleaving the abstract to its original abstract form.
