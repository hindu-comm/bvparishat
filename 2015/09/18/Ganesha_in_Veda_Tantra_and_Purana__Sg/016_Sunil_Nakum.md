Happy Ganesha Festival,  
  
First of all please forgive me for any unintended mistakes that my very first post would have. I've joined this group because of my increased interest in Samskrita from one of [Samskrita Bharati](http://samskritabharati.in/about-us-2/about-samskrita-bharati) group, and I was supposed to be silent listener about ongoing discussion from great samskrita scholars here. Today, I need to write to help me clear a doubt of mine, my close friend circle and many more like us, about the way we traditionally celebrate the Ganesha Festival.  
  
It all started with a colleague discussing about Ganesha Charuthi holiday with his USA based manager, as the discussion went further he asked many questions that we (at least me) rarely cared to thought about.  
  
1. Why we keep Ganesha idol for 10 days? (although people keep it for 1, 3, 5, and 7 days, but that I guess that could be comparatively a modern trend)  
2. What is the significance of immersing idol into river/sea or water in general?  
  
I would like to add one more question to it,  
  
3. Whether any reference of such traditional in ancient time or "Sastras" (please consider it in lay man terminology, I'm not knowledgeable enough to distinguish among them)?  
  
I searched on google and there are many stories (e.g. since idol making clay is taken from ponds/rivers it helps in deepening them; also the turmeric used during worship and later immersion of idol helps make river water clean; it symbolizes the getting a form in the shape of idol from formlessness and again merging into formless at the time of immersion etc.) that do not seem authentic but can't say they are wrong either, without any legitimate proof, this is why I'm writing to BV.  
  
On top of this, just yesterday only I received a WhatsApp message narrating the ancient story behind this festival. As it's in Marathi, I would like to just summarize it in English.  
  

> As per our religious literature Lord Ved Vyasa crafted Mahabharata but > it was not possible to write, so he invited Shree Ganesha to write it. > Ganesha agreed to write but he has to write day and night and drinking > water was prohibited, to avoid his (Ganesha's) body temperature > raising too much Vyasa applied coating of soil. So on Bhadrapada > Shukla Chaturthi, Vyasha worshiped Ganesha and because of soil coating > his boady was restricted he is named as Parthiv Ganesha. The writing > went on for 10 days, and on 10th day of Anant Chaturdashi when writing > got completed Vyasha dev found that Ganesha body temperature had > raised too high. To lower the body temperature and to remove soil > coating, he (Vayasa dev) dipped Ganesh into water. During these 10 > days, Ganesha was offered different types of festivities to eat. From > this the tradition of Ganesha festival started.  

  
I never heard about any such story, nor available on internet (until someone does copy-paste job and publishes this one too), although its well known fact that Shree Ganesha wrote the Mahabharata as Shree Ved Vaysa Deva kept narrating him. The above story seems (to me) a nice example of logical way of story making by distorting facts. I personally strongly condemn such things, specially when it is done with Religious things. People are being victimized of their faith in God, and they keep forwarding such messages without giving a second thought. It then becomes the duty of informed people (and those having means to get in touch with them) to put the things straight by introducing the facts to society.  
  
Please help me clear this doubt, so that I could reply to those messages with the real fact.  
  
Regards,  
Sunil
