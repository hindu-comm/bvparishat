नमस्ते ! ,

  

As per tantra Shastra (As per my Littile knowledge in Kerala Tantra Pujas )

  

A vigraha worship is done in the following way.

  

1, Getting the proper Vigraha from Shilpi with giving proper dakhina and finishing the tantric rituals

2\. we have to perform the all prayachithAs and Sudhi karmas for vigraha before start worshipping ,(sthala sudhi, Bimba sudhi, prasAda sudhi etc) Like Punyaha, and bimba-sudhi kriyAs.

3\. Once all these rituals are done, Acharya will do Pujas and various Homas and all idol installation (In temples it is performed in a very detailed way , with Angura Pujas , Jeeva kalasha Pujas etc)

4\. Once Prathishta is competed we have to perform daily pujas as per the pre determined way in the time of prathishta . Like one puja per day , 2 puja per day , trikala puja etc.

5\. There are some rules and rituals followed to give up a vigraha , We have to do udyusana (taking back the gods chitanya from the vigraha)

6 After those kriyas we can do the final actions like puting in to fire if it is made by wood, putting in to water if it is made by stone etc

7\. So in the case of Ganesha chathurthi vigraha aradhana also some miniture format of this are followed I guess , That is the reason they are doing nimanjan in water. (We are not supposed to put a vigraha with out udwasana (taking back the gods chitanya from the vigraha)

  

Dhanyavada:
