It would be interesting to know if there are references to Ganapati, as Shivaputra, in the Mahabharata, Ramayana and Kalidasa.

  

Among Advaitins, we have reference to Ganapati as Creator, sustainer, destroyer, in the Prapanchasāra of Shankara, Sarvajnātman's Sankshepaśāriraka invocation, prayer to Subrahmanya and Ganapati in Bhamati (Vācaspati Misra) invocation, etc. All these authors are admitted to be prior to the 9-10 CE.
