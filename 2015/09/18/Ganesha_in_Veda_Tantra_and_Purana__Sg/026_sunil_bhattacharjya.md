The Sarasvati probably reached the Pushkara and from there it reached the Luni river and together they flowed. A stream of that went to Prabhasha and then to the sea. That was before the earthquakes and the consequent rise of the land in the Aravalli region, which diverted the Sarasvati to west. This angle received the attention of lesser number of archaeologists.
