The repeated use of the word Anaary in the article indicates the influence of the old time orientalist characterization of Vaidika as Aryan and Avaidika as Anaary.



To view Pauranika ideas such as Shiva and Ganesha as borrowings from 'anaary' is typical of that approach.



In my view Pauranika is a product of a fusion culture resulting from the interaction between Vaidika and 'folk' cultures.



One crucial methodological care that needs to be taken in such study is to see if we are tracing the origins of the concept or the image of the concept or the narrative of the concept or thewords used in reference to the concept?
