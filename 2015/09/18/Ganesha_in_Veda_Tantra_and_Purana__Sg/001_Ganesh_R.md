Thanks for the article.  
We find the reference of Ganapathi bhavahuuti 's maalateemaadhava 's naandee verse. Even bhaaravi has a reference to Ganapathi. It is interesting to find the vinaayaka-vrtakalpa in yaajnavalkya emetic, where Ganapathi is a ugradEvataa. Can we ascribe 5-6th CE date to Ganesha puraana?
