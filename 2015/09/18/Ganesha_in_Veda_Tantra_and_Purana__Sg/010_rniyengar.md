Dear Sir,

Thanks for this quotation. To me it appears, from the Vedic and hence Vedantic point of view, special cosmic/celestial objects are bodies of *Jnani*s or *Rishi*s. We have Saptarshis and Agastya as stars. In the Ganapati archana it is saidOm Dhumaketave namah, a comet imagery. In modern parlance this principle is called in reverse as 'personification'. In the Parasharatantra, in the description of 26 comets, we come across one called "Shvetaketu son of Uddaalaka". One advantage of this representation is; if we are able to date the celestial phenomenon from modern methods, we can have an estimate of the period when our ancients, who could feel life pulsating in objects which we now treat as inanimate matter, lived in this country.

  

regards
