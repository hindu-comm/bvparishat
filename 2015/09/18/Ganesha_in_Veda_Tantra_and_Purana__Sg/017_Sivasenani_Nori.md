Sir

  

Let us look at the second query from the point of view of general custom. GaNeSa is worshipped not only on VinaayakachaturthI, but at the beginning of every pUjA. For instance, if we do Rudraabhishekam, or SatyanarayaNasvAmivratam, or PuNyAhavacanam, or GurunAthapUjA, it is customary to make a small VinAyaka with turmeric and offer pUjA to this lord of obstacles. How is this idol disposed of later, or how is nirmAlyam (used flowers etc.) disposed of? Usually we leave the idol at the root of a Tulasi plant, or it is immersed in the well (in the days when wells were practical). This is still the practice. From a Saastra point of view, the idol becomes God after the prANapratishTha mantra is recited and remains a God till the udvAsanamantra is recited. After udVAsana and before prANapratishTha, it is just a lump of turmeric (or clay as the case may be). Still one would not like to trample on it, so it is left in a place where people would not defile it, but where it would naturally decompose. The same principle holds for disposal of nirmAlyam or the sacred thread. When we do it on a larger scale, we look at a larger body of water, that is all. The Mimaamsakas have a principle that when a perceptible reason is available, an imperceptible reason need not be offered.
