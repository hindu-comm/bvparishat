R.N.Iyenger sir ! sorry for delayed pointing about prabhas-khanda of skandapurana .

till date there is an old temple in the somnath temple premises known as
कपर्दी विनायक. its said that the person who do not offer regards to kapardi vinaayak the yAtrA of the devotee for somanath is incomplete. this story is heard by me through our ancestors.

now the time to request you with all the group members.

i need pdf file of prabhaas-khanda only , if any one from the group can send me- i will be obliged.

i belongs to prabhAs and collecting mythic - historical details for prabhAs. reading of prabhAs-khanda will enrich my collection with the bless of the learned group.

i am eager to put several details for prabhAs if the forum allows me .

regards,

kamalesh pathak
