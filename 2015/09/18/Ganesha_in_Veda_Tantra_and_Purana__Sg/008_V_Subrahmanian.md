I remember an episode told by someone: Rudra, pleased with his knowledge, asked Sanatkumara to ask for any boon. The latter, being a nitya tṛpta, declined any boon. So, Rudra himself asked the sage to be his son and thus he obliged to be so. Maybe we can link it to the popular story too: When kumāra sambhava had to take place, it is Sanatkumara who entered that power that emerged as Kumāra. For, as per the bhashya, an ādhikārika puruṣa while taking a body for a particular purpose can do so by discarding an existing body or even take a new body while the existing body survives.
