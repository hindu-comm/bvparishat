'Mythical state of consciousness' is a word used by western myth theorists.(i) the word myth is not used in a pejorative sense here (ii) the state of experience of the originator of myth is what is meant. (iii) According to these theorists, this stateexisted once and can not be replicated now.



This is comparable to the traditional Indian view of aparokshaanubhava of Brahmarshis.



Yes, the word 'mythical state of consciousness'may not be a good choice. It has some western cultural underpinnings.
