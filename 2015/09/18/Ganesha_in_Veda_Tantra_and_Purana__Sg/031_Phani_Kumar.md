Namaste.

  

If "Among Advaitins, we have reference to Ganapati as Creator, sustainer, destroyer, in the Prapanchasāra of Shankara", then would that be advaita,sir? If Sankara who is supposed to have saidjeevo brahmaiva na parah also claimed that Ganapati was the creator etc, doesn't the stand present some difficulty in reconciliation or am I missing something? Thanks.
