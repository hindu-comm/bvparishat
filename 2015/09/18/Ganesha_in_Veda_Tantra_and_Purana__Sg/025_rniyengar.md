Nice to learn that you are interested in Prabhasa-khanda (PK). Kapardi-Vinayaka is described in Ch. 38.

I do not have a soft copy. My printed version in in Kannada script. For a soft copy please try

H.Bakker of Netherlands has worked on the Skandapurana extensively. My interest in the text is not from the religious view point. Since the PK describes a natural disaster including, earthquakes, tsunamis and the drying of river Sarasvati I got interested in the text deeply. The original River Sarasvati did not reach the present day SOmanath. The Prabhaasa (where Sarasvati entered the Sea) that is described in the PuraNa and MBh is not Somanath but a place in the Little Ran-of-kutch region, possibly nearer to present day PaaTaN. The geography described in PK has bearing on ancient history, including the location of Bhallatirtha where Sri Krishna left his body. It appears to me that Somanath in Saurashtra was known as Chandra-prabhaasa in contrast to another place Surya-prabhaasa in northern Gujarat. If you are interested in these discussions I request you to start a new thread.
