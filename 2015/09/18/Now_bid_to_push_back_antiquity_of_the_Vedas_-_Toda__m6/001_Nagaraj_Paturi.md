Vidwan Sarangan Shreyastoo posted the same news with the title "conference on Vedic chronology at DU", a few minutes ago.



Related report was published in Telegraph[here](http://www.telegraphindia.com/1150606/jsp/nation/story_24264.jsp#.VfulJWC6bIU)and that was shared by Prof. Dominik Wujastyk on Indology forum [here](http://list.indology.info/pipermail/indology_list.indology.info/2015-June/041312.html)



That lead to a huge discussion on that forum.



Interestingly, Prof. Dilip K Chakrabarti whose words in the Telegraph report werethought out to be or presentedto be againstProf. Bardwaj'sideas is the second to sign the petition to counter the anti-Modi petition.
