Dear Sir, Tiwari Sahab, I have sent you perhaps five foreign addresses to send (by Book Post) one copy of the Book Rasa-ganga-dhara, who were important among those present on dais while releasing the Book at Bangkok, Thailand. Besides, Prof. P. N. Shastri, VIce-chancellor, Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan, 56-57, Institutional Area, Janakpuri, New Delhi, was also present; one copy be given to him in New Delhi, The names of the addresses are:

Prof. J. L. Brockington (Edinburgh), Prof. Karina Presendendanz (Viena), Prof. Chirapat Prapannadvidya Bangkok), Prof. E. M. Houben (Paris), and one scholar from Australia. In the present mail I am sending one address Prof Thompson(England). Thus, only five copies of the book will be sent by Registered Book Post---less expensive.

Pl. lrt me know, where you received all these five addresseses or not.

With kind regard,   
  
Shankarji Jha,
