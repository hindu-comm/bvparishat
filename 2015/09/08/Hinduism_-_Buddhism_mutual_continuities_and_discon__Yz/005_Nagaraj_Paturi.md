At Nagarjunasagar, there is an archaeological site relocated at a village Anupu close to the dam. At this site, reconstruction work with meticulous detail was executed. Here, there is a reconstructed 3rd century vihara and an amphitheatre with fine acoustics and a Ranganathatemple in the same complex one beside the other.



In Satavahana inscriptions of the same period,kings are described as those who performed 100 Vajapeya yagas and the female members (wives and/or sisters ) as the ardent followers of Buddha Bhagavan.
