I missed responding to this post in time. But this may interest some readers :

In his book entitled*Hinduism and Buddhism*(1943 New York, The Philosophical Library), he begins the section on Buddhism with these remarkable, almost startling, words:

  

(p.45)" **The more superficially one studies Buddhism, the more it seems to differ from the Brahmanism in which it originated; the more profound our study, the more difficult it becomes to distinguish Buddhism from Brahmanism, or to say in what respects,if any, Buddhism is really unorthodox. The outstanding distinction lies in the fact that Buddhist doctrine is propounded by an apparently historical founder,understood to have lived and taught in the sixth century BC. Beyond this, there are only broad distinctions of emphasis... The teaching is addressed either to brahmans ...or to the congregation of monastic Wanderers.....but nothing could be described as a "social reform" or as a protest against the caste system. The repeated distinction of the "true Brahman" from the mere Brahman by birth is one that had already been drawn again and again in the Brahmanical books."**
