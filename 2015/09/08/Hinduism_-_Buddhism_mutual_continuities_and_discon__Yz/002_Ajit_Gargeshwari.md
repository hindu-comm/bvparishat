Prof. Paturi and Dr. Bhat have said it all.  
  
We as scholars have immense responsibility. Emphasizing continuity, national integration elimination dividing forces can be done by our writings. Scholars need to learn to keep disagreement in scholarly disputation in the spirit of scholarship rather than taking it personally and using victories in disputation to achieve their personal goals of ruling over communities or banishing communities. Our Indian history is a witness to such unhealthy trends that were witnessed in the past and is being done even now. By spreading the real spirit of scholarship, genuine inquiry and right education such problems will come down and finally be eliminated. Dividing and uniting forces will be always there as its a part of human nature. May the uniting force dominate is always an earnest desire  

  
I think I have mused enough for the day and for this thread  
  

Lets us discuss other aspects related to this thread. Please confine discussions with reference to the scope of the thread Hinduism' - Buddhism : mutual continuities and discontinuities"
