This thread is being created as a branch out from the thread "Modi visit to bodhgaya", on the moderator's suggestion of Dr Gargeshwari :



There, Nagaraj said as part of one of the posts:



Apart from this, next pointis that there are indeed huge number of continuities between Vedic tradition and Buddhism apart from a few discontinuities. This is true about many such complexcontinuities between various strands ofpre-modern Indian culturealongside the discontinuities between the same. To emphasise the discontinuities hiding the continuities, emphasizing diversity hiding unity is being done by anti-India forces with an ulterior motive. It is high time the attempts are countered by doingjust the opposite: emphasizing the continuities and unity.



As part of another post, he said:



But the fact remains that Buddhism, Jainism and Vedic tradition(under the title of 'Hinduism') are classified together into one single group called'Dharmic religions' by the scholars of Comparative Religion to distinguish them from say, Abrahamic or semitic religions. Dharmic religions have many other concepts apart from 'Dharma', such as jananamaraNachakra, kAlachakra etc. in common.



There were/are descriptions of Buddhism as 'protestant Hinduism' , as a 'subset of Hinduism' etc. by a certain strand of western scholarship too.Alexander Wynne's 'the origin of Buddhist meditation' and other such works do trace at least certain aspects of Buddhism to Vedic culture or texts .
