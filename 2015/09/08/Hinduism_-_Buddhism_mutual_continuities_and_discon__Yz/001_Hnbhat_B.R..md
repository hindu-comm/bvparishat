\> Apart from this, next pointis that there are indeed huge number of continuities between Vedic tradition and Buddhism apart from a few discontinuities. This is true about many such complexcontinuities between various strands ofpre-modern Indian culturealongside the discontinuities between the same. To emphasise the discontinuities hiding the continuities, emphasizing diversity hiding unity is being done by anti-India forces with an ulterior motive. It is high time the attempts are countered by doingjust the opposite: emphasizing the continuities .

यं शैवाः समुपासते शिव इति ब्रह्मेति वेदान्तिनो  
बौद्धा बुद्ध इति प्रमाणपटवः कर्तेति नैयायिकाः।  
अर्हन्नित्यथ जैनशासनरताः कर्मेति मीमांसकाः  
सोsयं वो विदधातु वांछितफलं त्रैलोक्यनाथो हरिः।।
