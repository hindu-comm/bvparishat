I thoroughly appreciate the views held by Sri Ajit gargeshwari ji and completely agree with them.

Coming to the discussion on Sri Shankaraacharya and Buddhism, I humbly suggest the scholars to have a look at the Sanskrit works of Sri SachchidaanandEndra-sarasvati like the shaankara-prakriyaa-bhaaskaraH where he has culled out fresh material from both the schools in a great detail and has shown the differences. His another work maaNDuukya-rahasya-vivRti is an original study on Gaudapaada's kaarikaa-s that thoroughly reviews the research of Vidhushekhara Bhattacharya which has been held high by many modern scholars in this regard. Swamiji's vEdaanta-prakriyaa-pratyabhijnaa too another veritable source in this direction.

Along with these, the writings of Professor Chandradhara Sharma are worth noticing.
