As a student of Tantra and Agama, i got the good fortune of studying under teachers like Pt. Chakravarty who was a disciple of M M. Gopinath kaviraj and others like him. I saw him as a scholar as well as a practitioner. He did share that being a scholar as well as a practitioner are complimentary to each other. He said the reason you study is to fulfill the purpose of your life i.e. to know your own self. As a scholar you probe deeper and as a practitioner you experience what you study. The insight received through practice is further deepened by study and vice-versa.

  

In tantras sometimes the texts are so difficult to understand as mere knowledge of sanskrit is not enough.For eg a single verse can have 7 different meanings. Sabdaartha , Bhaavaartha, Sampradaayaartha, nigamaartha, sarvarahasyaartha, Tatvaartha.

  

So without a traditional teacher who is definitely a practitioner it is not possible to understand these different layers of meanings. Just by sanskrit one may understand sabdaartha or at the most bhaavaartha but after that one needs to have an experience only then the teacher reveals the later meanings. I am sharing this after having first hand experience of the same.

  

For eg if one study yoga scriptures which describe Sushumna naadi, how much one can understand through mere theory. It is the experience which shows light and then the text starts speaking to us. This is my own experience. Experience gives me conviction and a clear direction as to where the text is leading. It also assures me that what the sages have said is true.
