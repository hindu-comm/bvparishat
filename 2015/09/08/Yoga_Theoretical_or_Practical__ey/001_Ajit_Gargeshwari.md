Thanks for sarting a new thread the other thread was getting too cluttered.  
  
All Indian Philosophical systems including Tantra, Buddhism Jianism have a practical and theoretical component. Theoretical ideas form the basis on which practical experiments are done and verified. The theoretical part is what is normally discussed in academia and the practical part is always personal left to the individual practitioner.  
  
Bhakti system of thought also has theoretical and practical side though usually the practical side gets more emphasis.Its left to the individual to decide if he wants to choose the practical or theoretical side.  
  
This list normally discusses the theoretical side and its implications on Indian culture and thought. Once we have clarity on this discussions will be more useful.
