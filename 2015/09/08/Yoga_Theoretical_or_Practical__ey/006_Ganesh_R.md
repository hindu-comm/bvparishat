Having complete agreement with Sri Subrahmaniyan, I wish to state that even in the fields of literary criticism and aesthetics, theory and practice has gone hand by hand. Our tradition has seen great aalamkaarika-s like daNDin, aanandavardhana, raahashEkhara, bhOja, Jagannatha etc who were good poets too.
