“In theory there is no difference between theory and practice; in practice there is.”

—Quoted by Walter J. Savitch in the book *An Introduction to the Art and Science of Programming* (1986), Menlo Park: Benjamin/Cummings, p. 366. Often incorrectly attributed to Yogi Berra.

  

I am starting a new thread for this discussion as the moderator suggested.



Vishal Ji said: Yoga is practical unlike its other counterparts in Indian philosophy.



Ajit Ji said: All Indian philosophy is practical in nature has moksha as its end. Lets one not be under the impression that only yoga system is practical and other systems are not.

  

I broadly agree with Ajit Ji. All major Indian darśana-s are practical. I would like to add that all major Indian darśana-s are also theoretical. So they are not only theory, or not only practice, but comprise both.  

  

Yoga is no different. The theory of Yoga is described in the Yoga Sūtra-s and their commentaries by Vyāsa, Bhojadeva, and Vācaspati Miśra, etc. The practice of Yoga is the performance of the means and reaching the states described in the Yoga Sūtra-s and their commentaries. Same is true for Haṭha Yoga. The Haṭhayogapradīpikā, Śiva Saṃhitā, Gheraṇḍa Saṃhitā, etc describe the theory of Haṭha Yoga. The practice of Haṭha Yoga is the performance of the āsana-s, prāṇāyāma-s, mudrā-s, bandha-s, and reaching the state of samādhi. Borrowing the terminology of Ganganath Jha’s translation (1907: Rajaram Tukaram Tatva, p. 9), Yoga Sūtra-s themselves list two non-practical pramāṇa-s (right notions): anumāna (inference) and āgama (testimony) accepted in the system of Yoga:

*pratyakṣānumānāgamāḥ pramāṇāni* (YS 1.7)

Jha’s translation: Perception, Inference, Testimony are the right Notions.

  

How about other schools? Let's take three examples: Nyāya, Bhakti, and Vyākaraṇa. Nyāya has a theoretical aspect (Nyāya Sūtra-s and their commentaries) and a practical aspect (reaching the state of *apavarga* which which is defined as the everlasting release from suffering: *bādhanalakṣaṇaṃ duḥkham*, *tadatyantavimokṣo'pavargaḥ* NS 1.1.21-22). Bhakti has a theoretical aspect (the Sūtra-s of Nārada Śāṇḍilya) and a practical aspect (śravaṇa, kīrtana, etc which lead to the experience of parama prema and the amṛtasvarūpa). Vyākaraṇa as a philosophy has a theoretical aspect (Vākyapadīya and other works) and a practical aspect (the parama pada attained by the study of grammar). Each of these schools is neither entirely theory, nor entirely practice.

  

Lastly, the word *philosophy* is used in English in the sense of theory. Quoting from the Cambridge dictionary:

  

**philosophy**

noun UK  /fɪˈlɒs.ə.fi/ US  /-ˈlɑː.sə-/    

B2 \[U\] the use of reason in understanding such things as the nature of the real world and existence, the use and limits of knowledge, and the principles of moral judgment:

René Descartes is regarded as the founder of modern philosophy.

See also PhD

the philosophy of sth

› a group of theories and ideas related to the understanding of a particular subject:

the philosophy of education/religion/science

› \[C\] a particular system of beliefs, values, and principles:

the Ancient Greek philosophy of Stoicism

C1 \[C usually singular\] informal the way that someone thinks about life and deals with it:

Live now, pay later - that's my philosophy of life!

  

*A scholar of Indian philosophy*, whether the philosophy of Yoga or other schools, is a theoretician by definition. A theoretician may or may not be a practitioner. A scholar of Yoga philosophy is not necessarily a Yogi. But same is true for other Indian schools. A scholar of Bhakti philosophy is not necessarily a Bhakta. A scholar of the philosophy of grammar is not necessarily somebody who has experienced the parama pada orśabda brahma).

  

Would like to hear thoughts on this from the members of list.
