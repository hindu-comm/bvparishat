A quick comment.

Not all the Scholars of Yoga Philosophy are the practitioners of Yoga. In the same token I have a small question. Are all the practitioners of Yoga, including the so many Institutes providing practice all over the world are Scholars of Yoga Philosophy presented through the YogaSutra of Patanjali, Vyasabhasya and its commentaries and sub commentaries? I think not all practitioners knowledge of Sanskrit to grasp the subtleties of the theoretical aspects. The same with others also.

A new generation of scholars should pop up combining both as envisaged by Hariparshada and not only by despising and upholding one against the other.
