In a broader sense I can say all Shastra's have Moksha as its end. Even Kama Shastra was looked upon as step toward liberation. Indians did not and could not think anything apart from elevating their standard thinking and always were concerned with the ultimate goal of life. Simple Living and high thinking was the motto.

अजो नित्यः शाश्वतोऽयं पुराणो न हन्यते हन्यमाने शरीरे।।2.20।।
