It can be said with certainty that the Vedanta sādhana too is not different from the general trend. A mumukshu, for instance, need not lay much importance to the study of the prasthānatraya bhashyas, etc. A keen interest and commitment to develop the sādhana chatuṣṭaya consisting of viveka, vairāgya, śamādi śaṭka and mumukṣutvam with Guru bhakti is what is stressed. For that matter one need not be a scholar in Sanskrit too for this. His surrender to the Guru is what takes him forward in the path by obeying the instructions of the Acharya. Some prakarana works, even in poetry form, like the daśaślokī, nirvāṇa śaṭkam, can form the core textual basis for such a mumukṣu's sādhana.
Much of the study of the main granthas help one to defend his system from the attacks of opponents. That is why texts like the Advaita siddhi are termed 'vādi grantha.' Acharyas teach the Panchadashi, Vivekachudamani, etc. to mumukshus. Those who intend to become Vidvans engage in full time study of the bhāṣyas and siddhi literature. They equip themselves with the prerequisites such as a reasonable exposure to nyāya, vyākaraṇa, sāhitya, pūrvamimāmsa, etc. before coming to Vedanta. This is what I have observed and learnt. However, it cannot be categorically stated that these people engaging in scholarly study are not mumukṣus. Nothing can bar them from engaging in serious ātma sādhana.
