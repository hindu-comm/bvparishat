This comment is with respect to Dr Bhat's Comment  
I don't think any serious academicians will read many of their books no doubt they are well intended and intended to serve non scholarly public There is mixture of Yoga Tantra exercises Hatha Yoga Kriya Yoga etc They subscribe to their Gurus who are famous. They have the money and propagate and lure in a lot people. They neither relay or base their teachings or practices on any Sanskrit texts as per formal cannons of interpretation though they quote Upanishads, vedas Yogic text quite profusely and in a superficial way.  
Books such as  
Homegrown Gurus, From Hinduism in America to American Hinduism Ann Gleich, Lola Williamson Sunny  
Gurus in America Thomas Forsthoefel A., Cynthia Ann Humes Sunny etc can be read to get a perspective
