Recently as part of the thread "Modi visit and US scholars letter, AyushmatI vidushI Usha quoted as follows:



The Bhagavad Gita is not as nice a book as some Americans think . . . Throughout the Mahabharata . . . Krishna goads human beings into all sorts of murderous and self-destructive

behaviors such as war . . . The Gita is a dishonest book; it justifies war.


--Wendy Doniger, in Philadelphia Inquirer

Recently I read an interview of Prof. Romilla Thapar by Ranabir Chakravarti published in Frontline [link](http://www.frontline.in/cover-story/linking-the-past-and-the-present/article7599425.ece?homepage=true) to which was provided in Indology forum.



One of the questions by Ranabir Chakravarti to Prof. Romilla Thaparwas this:



Actually this is something that often intrigues me: why Mahatma Gandhi, the champion of peace, held the Gita so central to his thoughts, **a text that actually upholds war and fratricidal violence.**



I was wondering to whom war and fratricidal violence was being instructed by the Acharyas who, treating gItA as part of prasthAnatraya, wrote bhAshyas to it.



While commonreaders of gItAin India easily keep saying that the war in the book is symbolic of war of life and focus completely on the various yogas taught by the book, I fail to understand how such learned individuals cantake such ridiculous meanings and make such ridiculous interpretations.
