There are different levels at which Krishna's instruction to Arjuna to participate in warcan be seen:



1\. Svadharma: It was Arjuna's svadharma to participate in the war. In today's parlance, it can be compared to the duty of the military personnel, police personnel and other such staff that chose 'violence' as their career. Do those scholarswho talk of the gItA as violence-preaching ask all the personnel involved in military and police duties in the respective countriesto protect all the citizens including these scholars not to resort to 'violence'?



This svadharma-instruction can be broadened to all other duties birth-based in the traditional varNa and caste systems in India and other such systems elsewhereand based on chosen career in the contemporary social systems. These other dutiesneed not necessarilyinvolve 'violence'



2\. Symbolic of war of life: To interpret Mahabharata war itself as symbolic of war in which individuals are engaged with various abstract aspects of life and an inner war with the psychological forces is not new in India. Books such as BharatarahasyaprakAs'a etc. have been written from centuries. The same is extended to the gItA and Krishna's instruction to Arjuna is seen as an instruction not to run away from life.



To reject all such meanings that are taken from the book by its readers and say that 'this is what it actually means, I know, so the book is bad' is absurd.
