Why look for commentaries? The main text of the gItA itself has the answers.

  

It is the very issue raised by these scholars i.e. the 'wrong in the violence of war' and 'wrong in the killing of the kin' that is raised by Arjuna in the first chapter.

  

The answer to that is the remaining chapters.

  

So the main text itself has detailed arguments and at the end of each such argument, sentences such asतस्माद्युध्यस्व भारत॥ 2\\-18॥,तस्मादुत्तिष्ठ कौन्तेय युद्धाय कृ‍इतनिश्चयः ॥ 2\\-37॥are used

  

These scholars just looking at these expressions, without going into the arguments that lead to those concluding expressions, are saying, "see, the book is goading to resort to violence "

  

To list all the arguments that lead to these conclusions makes it too big for an email.
