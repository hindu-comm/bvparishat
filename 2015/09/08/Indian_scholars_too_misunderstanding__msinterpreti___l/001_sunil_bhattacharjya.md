Dear friends,  
  
Ramala Thapar's reply to that question was as follows:  
  

**Quote**  

**I really don’t know enough about Gandhi’s thought and I haven’t read enough of his writing to judge this. My suspicion would be that violence/non-violence is only one side of the story. I wonder if the ultimate message that comes through, as it seems to in the case of Asoka, is not that of non-violence at any cost. It is non-violence provided you can defend it on moral grounds and there are no other issues involved. Asoka says that he hopes his sons and grandsons will be non-violent but if they have to be violent may they be merciful in their punishments. So it’s a controlled non-violence. Is it the same with the Gita? If it is a matter of power and ethics, then non-violence has to be more carefully negotiated. Would that fit Gandhi’s reading? Indian nationalism was contesting the evil of British colonialism. He doesn’t approve of violence, but was there a hint of condoning violence should the context demand it ? I have often wondered why Gandhi had so little interest in Asoka and more especially in his edicts. This is in contrast to Nehru, who greatly admired the message of the edicts. **

Another aspect of the Gita for Gandhi was its endorsement of the varnashrama dharma. Did it provide a firm point of knowing the structure of society and where one fits in, and providing a fixed point from where one could view problematic situations, especially when the world around one seems so uncertain? Where people are breaking the rules, is it necessary to provide a guide, such as the varnashrama dharma?**

**Those who see avoidable violence in the Bhagavad Gita, have either not read the Mahabharata or have clear anti-Hindu agenda. The war took place only when all the avenues for peaceful co-existence was closed by the Kauravas. The Kauravas believed in endless persecution of the Pandavas. Had they not disturbed the Pandavas in their Indraprastha or had they given five villages to the Pandavas to stay, there would have been no war. When there was no end to persecution by the Kauravas till their old age, the Pandavas had to sort it out, once for all. The war was fought when Arjuna reached the age of 79 years. For a moment Arjuna was taken aback when he saw his close relations on the opposite side and the Lord had to give him the advice so that he did not back out from his kshatriya dharma. Of course, Arjuna posed many more spiritual queries and the Lord replied to them and eventually Arjuna's equanimity got restored. He could see once again that there was no alternative left than to fight the war.

**As regards Gandhi on the Bhagavad gita, it was Annie Besant who was the person to present a copy of the Bhagavad Gita to Gandhi, and the frank person that Gandhi was he admitted that he did not understand everything that is said in the Bhagavad gita. He had problem in understanding the chapter 8, in particular. It appears that he knew the background which led to the Mahabharata war and he saw no reason to resent.
