hariH OM,

I am in complete agreement with the post of Damodar Das. Wars and violence are inevitable in any society. This is because of the very nature of the human mind.

For the christian critics of bhagavadgiita (BG), it is the rUpa which seems to matter. Questions about svarUpa are set aside. Hence the followers of the loving God will rape, plunder, pillage continent after continent, whereas the followers of the violent Gods such as Krishna, Kali etc. even now have a placid world view.

For the communist critics (romila etc.) it is just that the exhortation to violence isn't flowing from the vox populi but from the vox di. That the proletarian paradises of USSR, Cambodia had turned into killing fields (Stalin having killed about twice the number of people as Hitler and Pol Pot having eliminated about 1/3 of the population of Cambodia) has to be obfuscated, and what better way to do it than find violence in theory elsewhere. (offense is the best form of defense).

It will do great good for pathetic "intellectuals" such as wendy to question the unjust wars being fought everywhere in the world by their governments rather than find exhortations of violence elsewhere. I hope that they don't claim that George Bush was following BG when he attacked Iraq. Feigned scholarship of people such as wendy is employed to do the hitman's job. Unless we understand this, we will be trying to address each of their tantrums intellectually. This is a propaganda war against sanAtana dharma and Goebbels is their mata-pravartaka-AcArya.

svasti,  
 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,  
 shrivathsa.
