Irony is that most of such scholars subscribe to or sympathise with Marxism in which 'family' is one of the three artificial entities (along with 'state' and 'private property') bound to disappear in the hands of the forces of history. As such, 'fratricide'should be a misnomer as part of that system. ' Violence' for 'justice' (to the exploited class) is not wrong under that system.



If they are focussing on Mahatma Gandhi's commitment to non-violence and the contradiction in his following the 'violence-preaching' gItA, it would be a contradiction only ifMahatma read gItA as violence-preaching. It is well known that the sublime understanding of the 'war' in the book as 'war of life' got irreversibly established in the understanding of the gItA.
