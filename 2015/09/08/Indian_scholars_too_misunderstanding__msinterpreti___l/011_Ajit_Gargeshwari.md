Well summarized "our textual and cultural heritage will always be vulnerable to the invasions of Islamic, Christian, "secular", communistic and above all self styled swamijis, babas and communal religious heads. We need Scholars and we have profound learning. Above all, it should be well equipped with a profuse sense of objectivity that is deeply rooted in our cultural ethos. " They need to intellectually counter scholars

 by wrting good and better books and making such writing accessible. Readers can then decide what they want to take and what they want to leave
