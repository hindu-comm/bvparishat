Dear Sirs,

I completely agree with my friend Sri Shrivathsa regarding this issue and have often expressed in very many forums that we should never loose our hold on conserving and correctly interpreting our cultural texts and traditions. Apart from this, we should also be confident and capable enough to review and reject any unreasoned and ulteriorly motivated writings. This needs lot of courage coupled with profound learning. Above all, it should be well equipped with a profuse sense of objectivity that is deeply rooted in our cultural ethos.  
If not, our textual and cultural heritage will always be vulnerable to the invasions of Islamic, Christian, "secular", communistic and above all self styled swamijis, babas and communal religious heads.

Regards
