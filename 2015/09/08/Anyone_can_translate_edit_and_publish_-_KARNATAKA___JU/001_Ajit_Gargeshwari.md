Two quick comments  
  
Looks like a product launch from a publishing house  
  
"***StoryWeaver, which is being launched on International Literacy Day, is an open source platform of multilingual"  
  
***I did not understand the opening sentence of the news article ** or whats new in this ** How has Wikipedia pulled down the burden of Copyright  
  
***"The barriers of copyright have been pulled down, and a Wikipedia-like transformation of children’s literature is on the anvil."***
