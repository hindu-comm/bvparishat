I had seen pictures of Varna mapping in body in a Lalita text (Tamil) at Madurai a long time ago.  

Buddhists use it in their healing sessions. It possibly has some ayurvedic applications.  

I want to check if there is an origin of such literature.  
  

Present nyasa mantras seem to be simplified and do not seem to be varna oriented.  
  

I guess one could theorize that the varna is the sakti in a limb in a cosmological context. (so is my interest)  

(Such theory would have a lot of assumptions of creation of human body, but mapping the body with sound possibly has merit!)  
  

If there as scholars of sakti literature in the group, they can probably help.
