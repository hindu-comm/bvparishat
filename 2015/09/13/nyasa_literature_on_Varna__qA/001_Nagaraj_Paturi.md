Dear Prof. Misra,



There is no such generalized theory of varna-limb mapping.



Limb to/fromvarna/varna sequencemapping in Anga nyasa and Kara nyasa differs from mantra to mantra.



Each mantra is divided into reasonable parts and sequence of those parts into or through each limb or finger is arrangedso as to 'get possessed' by the mantra or 'hold the mantra in the inside' of the body of thesaadhaka.
