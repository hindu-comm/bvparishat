As regards "Tea" I read an article years ago that Sushruta said that there are 40 types of Soma-plants and these are available in the North-eastern Himalayas. Tea-plant was found among the naturally growing plants in the north-eastern slopes of the Himalayas in Assam and there was the tradition of drinking tea-concoctions among the people of the North-eastern India. It has been surmised by some scholars (I do not have the details ready with me now) that the Tea can be one of the 40 types of Soma plants. Thus there exists a possibility that tea was accepted for its value by the ayurvedic doctors in the past.
