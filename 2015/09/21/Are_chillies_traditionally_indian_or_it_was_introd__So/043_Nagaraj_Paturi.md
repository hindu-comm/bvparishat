Vidwan Damodara Dasaji,



Before deciding your menu, please be sure of your criteria.

.

Ayurveda's listing in pathya can not be a criterion for a specific group with a specific worldview, or spiritual or religious sensitivity.



Ayurveda lists non-vegetarian food too as part of pathya. It addresses all social groups. But a vegetarian chooses only the vegetarian items of the pathya.



Commentaries according to the tradition followed by you to the relevantverses in the Bhagavadgita, can be a good guide.



For traditions having followers abroad, it may be a good idea not to be rigid about the Indian origin of the plant.
