Vidwan Damodara Dasa's question:



I want to know from this forum that "Are chillies really not indian in  
origin" i.e. were they introduced by Moghul or British or are there  
descriptions of chilli available in ancient Indian literatures



AadaraNIya Sivasenaniji:



It is a part of what is called Visvamitrasrishti



(The word 'Visvamitrasrishti' is being used for vegetations of
non-Indian origin, with origin outside India -Nagaraj)



AadaraNIya Sunil Bhattacharyaji:



It may be better to find out if anybody has done any scientific studies to trace how (and If at al)l the chilli came to India from Chile.



Scientific study is reported [here.](https://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/proceedings1993/v2-132.html)



Based on such studies, it is said
[here](http://www.chilly.in/origin_of_chili.htm) that



The origin of chilies is believed to be as old as **7000 B.C**. used in Mexico. Chilies were grown and **cultivated from 3500 BC**. Mexicans used it to spice up their food. Chili was brought to the rest of the world by Christopher Columbus who discovered America in 1493. Christopher had set from Spain to reach India to bring spices such as pepper back to his country. Christopher not only mistook America for India, but also mistook chili as the black pepper. That is how the chili got the name ‘**chile pepper**.’ He took chile pepper back to Spain where it became a very famous spice.



<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chili_pepper>

says

Chili peppers originated in the Americas. After the Columbian Exchange, many cultivars of chili pepper spread across the world, used in both food and medicine. Chilies were brought to Asia by Portuguese navigators during the 16th century.

Word origin dictionary says

early 17th century: from Spanish *chile*, from Nahuatl *chilli*

Thus

(1) Chile pepper or Chile is from outside India

(2) Its origin is in South America from the areas around Chile

(3) No other etymology of the word Chile is given anywhere.

(4) Tracing the origin of the word Chile in Chile pepper to the place name Chile was not totally unfounded or unreasonable
