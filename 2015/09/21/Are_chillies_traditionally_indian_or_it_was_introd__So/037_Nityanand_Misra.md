A minor point specific to BG 17.9. BG 17.9 uses two words ‘kaṭu’ and ‘tīkṣṇa.’ As ‘tīkṣṇa’ has been separately used, commentators on the verse have interpreted the word ‘kaṭu’ as bitter, and ‘tīkṣṇa’ as pungent. In the collection of eleven commentaries published by Gujarati Printing Press (1895) and the eight commentaries published by Nirnay Sagar Press (second ed. 1936), the commentators who have given examples under the categories listed in BG 17.9 have listed ‘marica’ (black pepper) under ‘tīkṣṇa.’

आनन्दगिरि - कटुस्तिक्तः कटुकस्य तीक्ष्णशब्देनोक्तत्वात्

वेदान्तदेशिक - तीक्ष्णस्यापि मरीचादेः

वेङ्कटनाथ - अतितीक्ष्णो मरिचादिः

पुरुषोत्तम - अतितीक्ष्णो मरिचादिः

नीलकण्ठ - अतितीक्ष्णो मरिचादिः

मधुसूदन - अतितीक्ष्णो मरिचादिः

धनपति- अतितीक्ष्णं मरिचादि

श्रीधर - अतितीक्ष्णो मरिचादिः

  

Even modern commentaries like Tattvavivecanī list red chilly under ‘tīkṣṇa.’
