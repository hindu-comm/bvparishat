Hare Krishna.  
Dear Scholars,  
Thankyou for this nice discussion. This is just to acknowledge my  
presence, I am not out of this discussion but am reading all the  
answers and getting a lot of help. Please continue this discussion and  
I will also contribute, by reading some the literatures mentioned  
here, contacting some people and by my own research.

\>\> Based on such studies, it is said here  

\>\> \<<http://www.chilly.in/origin_of_chili.htm>\> that  
\>\>  
\>\> The origin of chilies is believed to be as old as \*7000 B.C\*. used in  
\>\> Mexico. Chilies were grown and \*cultivated from 3500 BC\*. Mexicans used  

\>\> it to spice up their food. Chili was brought to the rest of the world by  
\>\> Christopher Columbus who discovered America in 1493. Christopher had set  
\>\> from Spain to reach India to bring spices such as pepper back to his  
\>\> country. Christopher not only mistook America for India, but also mistook  

\>\> chili as the black pepper. That is how the chili got the name ‘\*chile  
\>\> pepper\*.’ He took chile pepper back to Spain where it became a very  

\>\> famous spice.  
\>\>  
\>\> <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chili_pepper>  
\>\> says  
\>\> Chili peppers originated in the Americas. After the Columbian Exchange,  
\>\> many cultivars of chili pepper spread across the world, used in both food  
\>\> and medicine. Chilies were brought to Asia by Portuguese navigators  
\>\> during  
\>\> the 16th century.  
\>\> Word origin dictionary says  

\>\> early 17th century: from Spanish \*chile\*, from Nahuatl \*chilli\*
