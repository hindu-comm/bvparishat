The terminology used in Ayurveda works to describe the six rasas or their 63 permutations may not necessarily be used outside of Ayurvedic works to describe them. Although Ayurveda is helpful in understanding the verses of Gita describing the three-fold classification of foods, ultimately the Gita is not an Ayurvedic work. Whether one takes six rasas or their sixty-three combinations as per Ayurveda, one a direct correspondence with the seven words kaṭu, amla, lavaṇa, uṣṇa, tīkṣṇa, rūkṣa, and vidāhin used inBG 17.9 may not exist.

  

My humble opinion is that to rationally evaluate thepūrvapakṣaof the various commentators vis-a-vis your uttarapakṣa, we first needa fair representation and explanation of thepūrvapakṣa which I have not seen in your response. In addition we also need toexplore the usage of the words‘kaṭu,’‘tikta,’and’tīkṣṇa’in non-Ayurvedic works. Is there an overlap in the meanings of these words when used outside an Ayurvedic context? If there is, then the commentators are perhaps justified in interpretingtīkṣṇa askaṭu andkaṭu astikta.

  

Thanks, Nityanand
