Should chillies be used in the food to be given to guru-kula students? As I recall, the following points have not been made in the discussion:  
  
1. Ancient Indians do not seem have shunned something because of a thing’s known or probable foreign origin (recall: Yavana-jātaka or -siddhānta, praising Mlecchas for their skill in making yantras, pronouncements like ā no bhadrāḥ kratavo yantu viśvataḥ).  
  
2. Āyurveda is a smṛti. Smṛtis change according to deśa and kāla. What is more important for smṛti acceptance is not the origin of a thing but what the learned and insightful, having no vested interest, the śiṣṭas, conclude about possible effects, relative to the time, region and measure and way of acceptance (in this case, consumption).  
  
3. Many, if not all, religions of India have two main types of fasting: (a) that in which nothing is put into the body and (b) that in which only specific eatables and drinkables are consumed. Of (a), nirjala is more severe, with non-swallowing of even saliva as a still more severe form. It is (b) that concerns the present discussion. In it, eatables like tapioca, potatoes, and foreign varieties of certain fruits like banana are routinely consumed over a large area of India. A guru-kula following a narrower understanding of what its students should eat will have much explaining to do, probably frequently. It may even need the services of a specialist devoted to the historical study of food items.( In noting this, I am not suggesting that more work should be viewed negatively. More work is good for scholarship. Here, I am just pointing out a practical difficulty. How many specialists of food history are there in contemporary India?)  
  
4. Attaching greater importance to (a) timeless or non-diachronic principles and (b) conclusions drawn by contemporary unselfish scholars is the strength of dharmic traditions. It is what allows them to see no conflict between science and religiosity and to change as objective knowledge changes (although they too are at present under pressure to become organized religions). If greater importance is attached to historicity, the Indian dharma traditions will suffer from the same logical and social weaknesses as the exclusivistic religions do (rigidity of dogma, naive insistence on only one name, one scripture etc.). History is important, but it should not be the sole or most dominant arbiter of how life is led.  
  
5. In my experience, Indian restaurants are serving more and more hot/sharp food, which has been scientifically proved to be bad for health. (Eating at a Dasaprakāśa hotel is no longer as sāttvic an experience as it used to be.) If chillies are accepted in guru-kulas, care should be taken to ensure moderate use.
