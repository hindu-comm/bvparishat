South American country, probably named from a local native word subsequently confused with Mexican Spanishchile"chili pepper" (see[chili](http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=chili&allowed_in_frame=0)). Suggestions are that the native word means "land's end" or else "cold, winter," which would make a coincidental convergence with Englishchilly. Related:Chilean.
