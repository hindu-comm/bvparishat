Dear Prof. Korada Ji

  

I have not said that the interpretation of the commentators (including stalwarts like Vedāntadeśika and Madhusūdana Sarasvatī) is the only correct interpretation. I have only tried to justify their interpretation of words in BG 17.9 in a specific way by providing certain citations from koṣa-s (not nighaṇṭu-s) and commentaries onkoṣa-s. The learned commentators may not have felt the need to interpret words strictly from the lens of the terminology used in Āyurveda.

  

I am afraid I respect your opinion but disagree with it. You have suggested to stop the discussion, and I agree that there is no use continuing this on the current thread.

  

Thanks, Nityānanda
