Yes, it seems to be coincidental convergence with the place name.



But an interesting coincidence though, because the place of origin of the plant according to research is Bolivia which is close to Chile.



For an Indian of the British time, it would have been difficult to sort out the coincidental convergence from the actual etymologyor it would have been difficult to imagine Bolivia as different from Chile.
