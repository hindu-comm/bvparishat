Chilli was not grown in India till maybe six hundred years or so ago. It is a part of what is called Visvamitrasrishti. In some orthodox circles I heard that pepper is used in the place of chilli.

That said, I am not in favour of this kind of orthodoxies. If we want to maintain high standards it must be in virtues like Ahimsaa, Asteyam and Saucam and practices like Indriya nigraha. Within India, there is wide variety in foods. North and east of Vizag we get Potal, which is not found in South. The cucumber of Hyderabad is not found in North Andhra. Banana varies from the west coast to east coast. I remember that during my time in Assam there was a vegetable similar to Mango which I used to make dal - this is not to be found elsewhere. Then we have vegetables in river islands, which are often different in size compared to their mainland namesakes. When it comes to leafy vegetables or pulses, one has to go strictly per the practice in a given region.
