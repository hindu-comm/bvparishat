Hare Krishna.  
Respected Vidvajjanas,  

  
\>\> You have suggested to stop the discussion, and I agree that there is no use continuing this on the current thread.  
  

Yes, the discussion on the meaning of words 'katu' and 'tiksna' may be  
stopped on this thread, but I suggest that the discussion on the main  
issue of the thread - "Are chillies originally Indian in use" can be  
carried on.  
  
So far in our discussion, it is evident that chillies are not Indian  
in origin. Some conclusion can be arrived soon.  
  
Regarding our project members using it in menu or not, there are a few  
more factors that will decide the outcome. But as this is one of the  
factors I wanted to get clear picture of it. I thank all vidvaj-janas  
for their participation.  
  
Thankyou,  
Damodara Das
