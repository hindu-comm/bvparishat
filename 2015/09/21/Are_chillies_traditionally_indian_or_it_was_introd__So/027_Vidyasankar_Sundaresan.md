These plants, depending on their variety, can grow from highly humid conditions to dry desert conditions. They require a lot of heat in the soil and easily die if the soil temperature gets low. They really thrive in tropical conditions, so they have adapted to India very well. The milder varieties, like the capsicum that we can cook as a separate vegetable (simla mirchi as it is called in Mumbai), adapt well to milder temperatures. They don't like waterlogged soils, so they don't grow well in marshy lands. High humidity + high temperatures + good soil drainage are a good combination for growing the hotter varieties.  
  
Best regards,
