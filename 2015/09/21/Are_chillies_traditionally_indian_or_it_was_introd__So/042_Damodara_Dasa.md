Hare Krishna.  

  
Ayurveda has no problem with exotic plants, as I said in one of my  
previous posts.  
  
Food items cooked using marica or chilly, without cittaśuddhi of the  
cook, may cause inconvenience in the consumer. Also, to avoid  
dṛṣṭidoṣa we recite some verses that was cited in texts like  
kṣemakutūhalam.  
  

I agree. Thankyou for this nice information. I shall consider these  
points also, specifically that ayurveda has no problem with exotic  
plants. Also I shall look deep into the reason of the emotion to avoid  
non-indian things in food etc. (even in ancient temples). Is this  
emotion vedic or traditional or is this coming from modern sources.  
Also reasons why some persons are adamant over this?  
  
Thankyou,  
Damodara Das
