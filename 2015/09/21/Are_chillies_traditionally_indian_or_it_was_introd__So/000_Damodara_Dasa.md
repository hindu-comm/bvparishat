Hare Krishna.  
Dear Vidvajjanas,  
During our fixing menu for our gurukula in Gujarat, a discussion came  
that chillies are not indian in origin and thus it is better that we  
avoid it. Pepper seems to be a good alternative. But chilli has a  
specific taste that pepper cannot replace.  
  
I want to know from this forum that "Are chillies really not indian in  
origin" i.e. were they introduced by Moghul or British or are there  
descriptions of chilli available in ancient Indian literatures  
(specifically puranas, itihasas, Vedas, etc).  
  
Thankyou,  
Damodara Das
