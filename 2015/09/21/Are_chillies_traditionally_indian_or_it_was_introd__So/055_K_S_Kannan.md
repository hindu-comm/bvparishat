1. Ancient Indians do not seem have shunned something because of a thing’s known or probable foreign origin (recall: Yavana-jātaka or -siddhānta, praising Mlecchas for their skill in making yantras, pronouncements like ā no bhadrāḥ kratavo yantu viśvataḥ). - AA.  

  

Indeed so.

  

Was it S'abara who said the *mleccha*-s were better skilled in taking care of birds ?
