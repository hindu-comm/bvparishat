To

Prof. Sunil Bhattacharjya Ji and other members! Namaste.

Yes. My statement that Chillies were first imported from the country Chile is not proof supported but an information stored in my mind through many decades which was resulted from one of my friends from the Botany Department of Andhra University who was a the then research scholar of that department. 

On one occasion when I had to speak about the use of black pepper in Chitrannam Prasadam and Dadhyodanam Prasadam at the Famous Simhachalam Sri Varaha Lakshmi Narasimha Temple, Visakhapatnam I consulted my above friend about the origin of the Chillies. Then I was informed by him that it belongs to Solanaceae family and its early origin was from America but imported first from Chile to India.

The same information I used for my speech on that occasion and ever since I have all through these years been in the same impression and the same has been conveyed in the present context.

I must thank Prof. Sunil Bhattacharjya Ji for alerting me in an appropriate manner as a result of which I tried to google for its origin where I too could not get any reference for its being first imported from Chile to India.

The only mistake I have done here is conveying it as my own statement with no sources of that information for which I may seriously be excused.

Warm regards to all,
