You may profitably refer to the excellent publication, "Portuguese Vovables in Asiatic Languages,-by Anthony X. Soares.Published in the famous Gaekwad Oriental Series(GOS) as No.74 in 1936,Oriental Institute,Baroda.

It gives very useful information about the words,popular in our languages,but, derived from Portuguese. You may find some clue to the chillis also.

Best luck.
