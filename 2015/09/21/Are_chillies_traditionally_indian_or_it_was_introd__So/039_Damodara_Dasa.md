Hare Krishna.  
  
So it is accepted that all 6-rasas are to be taken in balance (it may  
need some survey of traditions all over India if this rule was  
followed).  
  
Still katu (or tiksna) whatever may be the name, can be achieved from  
pepper, etc. even without using chillies. So still it doesn't answer  
the question fully. It does answer that if katu-ness (or tiksna-ness)  
of chlli is the reason for not comsuming it then small (or yukta)  
amount of it is not prohibited. Similarly more amount of pepper is  
also prohibited. That means this sloka of Bhagavad-gita does not  
prohibit eating chillies per se.  
  
Thankyou,  
Damodara Das
