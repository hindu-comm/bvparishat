The bhut jolokia is already well known as a cultivated hybrid chili with a fairly recent origin. It was cultivated in the Assam region, but the parents of this hybrid are from elsewhere.

A general rule is that the geographical region where you find the maximum genetic diversity is the place that is the best candidate for assigning native origins. Central and the northern parts of South America are the best candidates for all chili varieties, but today, India is the largest producer, consumer and exporter of chilies. A number of crops that are used worldwide today originate from the new world and were introduced to Asia, Europe and Africa only after the Spanish and Portuguese started conquering the Americas. These include potatoes, tomatoes, cocoa, tobacco, corn and the most recently popularized grain, quinoa.

In very observant south Indian households, the food for SrAddha rituals avoids the use of chilies, as also vegetables introduced to India in recent times, such as cabbage, carrots, potatoes etc. On the other hand, we also avoid toor dal and chana dal for SrAddha food, although both are known to have been cultivated and eaten in India for more than 3000 years. We don't avoid any of these for regular consumption at other times.
