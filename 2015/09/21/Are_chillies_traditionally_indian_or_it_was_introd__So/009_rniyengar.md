Very correct. So also are Rose, Cashew and Coffee. Some how even in many of our temples the first two are not rejected but Coffee has no place. Some food for thought !

  

I have heard that in the Tirupati temple, cashew was taboo in the Laddus, a few decades back. It appears gradually almond got displaced by cashew. But still chillies are not used.
