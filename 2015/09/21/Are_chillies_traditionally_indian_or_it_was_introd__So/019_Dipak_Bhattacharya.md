Nalapākadarpaṇa edited from original manuscripts by late Mm. Vamacharan Nyayacharya (1879-1931) of the then Government Sanskrit College (later Sampurnanand Sanskrit Visvavidyalaya) was published before 1930 in Varanasi. I may tell the exact date later. A copy will be available at the Sarasvati Bhavan Library.
