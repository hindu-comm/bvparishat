Some of the Saiva Agama-s do contain a chapter called NAIVEDYAVIDHI; there we find practical instructions for cooking those food items that are offered to Siva and other gods as naivedya in the temple.  
They do also contain the details about measurements of different ingredients.  
Some of these food items look 'strange' in the modern context as we are not generally used to such items that appear to be prevalent in olden times. But many of the popular food items that we find nowadays in the temple (especially in the south indian context) are not at all found in these chpaters of the Saiva Agama-s.  
  
The 13th century text of Maanasollaasa by Someshvara contains some chapters on the ancient culinary art of ancient Bhaaratadesha.  
  
Some years ago an european doctorate student was working on the Naivedyavidhi chapters of these Agama-s, but I do not remember the details. Also there was an indian doctorate working on this text, especially on these chapters.  
  
*NB. But in none of these chapters DO WE FIND ANY MENTION OF CHILLIES, POTATOS, REFINED SUGAR OR OTHER SUCH MODERN INGREDIENTS.
