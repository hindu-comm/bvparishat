If you ask Ayurvedic Physician, to get Vegetables for cooking, you will get only herbal medicines only for your food as all other vegetable people use will have one or more दोष-s he will find in them.

This is an exaggeration.



You seem to have a troublesome experience with some Ayurvedic doctor.



नास्ति मूल मनौषधम् is followed by Ayurveda.



In ऊर्ध्वं जिगातु भेषजं , भेषजं referrers to all plants.



In

पुष्णामि चौषधीः सर्वाः सोमो भूत्वा रसात्मकः ॥ 15\\-13॥

also, ओषधीः refers to all plants.

In fact, Ayurvedic principle is that one 'dosha' balances the other (two). Hence all plants can become pathya for one or the other person.

For example if an Ayurvedic bhishak says this plant or plant-part or recipe has/causes this dosha, it does not mean it is not edible at all. vaatakaaraka food is pathya for paityakritarogapeeDita person.

An Ayurvedic doctor wrote a book in Telugu by name bhojanabhogamonly to remove unnecessary fears about different food items.
