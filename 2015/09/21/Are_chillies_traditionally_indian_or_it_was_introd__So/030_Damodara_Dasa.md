Hare Krishna.  
  
----------------------------------  
From respected Korada Subrahmanyamji,  

  
Obviously , Chillis fall under राजसाहार --  
कट्वम्ललवणात्युष्णतीक्ष्णरूक्षविदाहिनः।  
आहारा राजसस्येष्टा द्ःखशोकामयप्रदाः॥ ,, 17-9  
अतिकटु - अत्यम्ल - अतिलवण etc - says शांकरभाष्यम् ।  

-------------------------  
अतिकटु, this means that if taken in more amount, then it is rajasika,  
otherwise not.  
  
Also, we are trying to give full organic diet to our children and hope  
to be fully successful in a few months from now. This is ofcourse an  
important point as children are future of any community and if they  
are physically, mentally, and spiritaully healthy the society can  
easily achieve aim of human life successfully.  
  
It is nice that scholars are giving their valuable inputs to this  
question and I will read the different references provided in this  
conversation.  
  
Thankyou,  
Damodara Das
