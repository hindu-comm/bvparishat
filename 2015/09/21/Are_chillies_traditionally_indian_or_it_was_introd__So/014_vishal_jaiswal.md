Then you would have to avoid all foods that are not Indian in origin.  
It is definitely possible, because India has a wide variety when it  
comes to choices.  
But you have to think hard if you can live without tea, coffee,  
vegetables like cauliflower, cabbage, and fruits like custard apple,  
guava, etc.  
And if it was a real gurukul, you would think of only getting organic food.  
As far as I know, no gurukul or religious place or yoga center across  
all of India has organic food, as of today. When you ask them, their  
reply is we have "sattvic" food, but they forget that real sattvic in  
itself would include organic.  
Sorry for the slight digression at the end of this note - in strictly  
intellectual/academic matters, important practical things like organic  
food should have no say.
