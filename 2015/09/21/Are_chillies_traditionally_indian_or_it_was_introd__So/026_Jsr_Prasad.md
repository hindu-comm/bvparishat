High standards in spiritual practice instead of orthodoxy tradition in food, and sAttvikAhAra/organic food suggestion by res. Prof. Korada Subrahmanyam ji and Sri Vishal Agarwal and Sri Siva Senani can be given a thought by sri Damodara Dasa. Thanks to Sri Satavadhani R. Ganesh ji for suggesting books on plants of foreign origin in Kannada. Prof. Wakankar ji's hint might be useful to explore further, while Prof. Dipak Bhattacharya ji's bibilographical detail is really helpful.  
  
Dr. K.T. Achaya (1923-2002) has authored a couple of books related to Indian food: 1. The Illustrated Foods of India, OUP (1994) 1. A Historical Dictionary of Indian Food (2002) 3. Indian Food: A Historical Companion (1998). More related books can be found on Amazon/Flipkart. Also, Prof. P.V. Sharma's (an Ayurvedic scholar) book on 'Fruits and Vegetables in Ancient India' might be helpful to look back the historical journey of vegetables of Indian origin.  
  
Prof. R.N. Iyengar ji's reference to Tirupati Laddu is interesting. But still some Vaishnavite scholars strictly use vegetables and cooking ingredients of Indian origin only at homes. Using cashew in preparing Laddu may be somewhat political too as tenders are called in crores of rupees for its supply in tonnes. Inclusion of such dry fruits in prasAdam might be the influence of the trust board, of which, some members run several such parallel businesses (I may be wrong here!).  
  
Prof. Nagaraj ji might have wanted to refer the pharmaco-dynamics (rasapancaka) of dravyas instead of the Vata-Pitta-Kapha in plants of foreign origin. Of course, it is attested in the tradition – नास्ति मूलमनौषधम् । For instance, the most popular 'aloevera' is an exotic herb and in vogue in India since 16th C., as quoted in Bhavaprakasa Nighantu. Today, you can imagine, aloevera minus Ayurveda pharmacy = ?  
  
Bhavaprakasa offers the following information on 'marica.' Derivation: 'म्रियन्ते जन्तवोऽनेनेति वा म्रियते जिह्वा अनेन इति मरिचम् ।' Rasapancaka: Latin name - Piper nigrum, Family – Pipereceae; रसः - कटुः, गुणः - लघु, वीर्यम् - उष्णम्, विपाकः - कटुः, कर्म - कफवातजित् , दीपनम्, छेदनम् ।  
  
Sri Viyasankar Sundaresan ji – has South America possess a vast arid land, as chillis are highly grown in arid lands in India? I am not aware whether this crop is also cultivated in marshy lands.
