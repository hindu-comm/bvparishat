Very nice to hear that you have taken note of the importance of food  
without chemicals.  
This is the key point that keeps me from exploring or studying at  
various yoga centers around the country, because I do not wish to  
consume slow poison.  
Another point you can explore is that the diet in yoga is not the same  
as that in Ayurveda.  
Though (from my practical experience) the yoga diet is ideal, it would  
be too restrictive or boring for the layman.  
Regarding tea (& even coffee) - both are excluded in yoga.
