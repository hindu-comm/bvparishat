The spiciness of chillies referred to by śaṅkara, as 'atikaṭu,' reminded me a real life incident happened in the life of H.H. 35th Jagadguru [śrīmadabhinava-vidyātīrtha-mahāsvāmigal](http://www.sringeri.net/jagadgurus/sri-abhinava-vidyatirtha-mahaswamiji/biography), before His sannyāsāśrama. In His pūrvāśrama, revered Swamiji was known as Srinivasa Sastry. The following happened when he was a little boy.  
  

"*One day , He and His friends unintentionally consumed a very pungent dish served to them at a house. The friends screamed for water and jaggery. Sri Srinivasa Sastry remained undisturbed. He advised His friends that such longing for jaggery was unnecessary. Their mouths were burning, as it were, and here* *He was adding fuel to the fire. "You speak thus," they challenged, Can you eat a handful of chillies without a murmur of protest?" "Yes," was the reply*. *Immediately,* *a handful of chillies were brought. One by one the chillies disappeared into His mouth. The boys looked on, more astonished than disappointed. All the chillies were consumed without any trace of discomfort on His face. He then said, "It is not necessary to consume spices like this. You have demanded it and so I ate them to convince you that it is possible to be contended with what food one gets."* (source: Yoga, Enlightenment and Perfection, Sri Vidyateertha Foundation, 2nd Reprint, Chennai, 2001 pp. 19-20)  
  

I believe, revered Swamiji's message was very clear, through the above incident.
