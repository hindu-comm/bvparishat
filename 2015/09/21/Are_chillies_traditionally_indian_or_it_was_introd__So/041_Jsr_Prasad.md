Namaste.

One man's food is another man's poison or one man's poison is another man's cure. What rasa should be given prominence is based on the prakṛti of an individual. In addition to Sushruta's explanation as cited by Prof. Subrahmanyam garu, Caraka offers the following as per 'doṣa.'  

  
1. कटु, तिक्त and कषायs generate **वात**  

2\. मधुर, आम्ल and लवणs pacify the above  

3\. कटु, आम्ल and लवणs generate **पित्त**  

4\. मधुर, तिक्त and कषायs pacify the above  

5\. मधुर, अम्ल and लवणs generate **कफ**  

6\. कटु, तिक्त and कषायs pacify the above.  
  

So, based on the body constitution (predominance of certain doṣa), one may consider consuming appropriate rasas and avoid rasas that generate viruddhaguṇa. Otherwise, there might be a problem in achieving the 'धातु-साम्यक्रिया,' because, it is said that 'आहारसम्भवं वस्तु रोगाश्चाहारसम्भवाः ।' Again, one has to change food habits based on seasonal changes. Hence, food is the basis for either health or disease. Besides the above, Caraka says in mātrāśitīyādhyāya, 'उष्णमश्नीयात्, स्निग्धमश्नीयात्, मात्रावदश्नीयात्, जीर्णेश्नीयात्, वीर्याविरुद्धमश्नीयात्, इष्टे देशे इष्टसर्वोपकरणं चाश्नीयात्, नातिद्रुतमश्नीयात्, नातिविलम्बितमश्नीयात्, अजल्पन्नहसन्तन्मना भुञ्जीत ।' and so on and so forth. This is as part of dinacaryā. If these general parameters are not maintained, then there would be imbalance in health, in spite of following doṣa specific rasa consumption.

In your first post, you said that \<*a discussion came that chillies are not indian in origin and thus it is better that we avoid it*.>. Does dharmaśāstra prohibits foods of foreign origin, may be yes. Reasons can be discussed. Considering the scholarly inputs in this thread, if you are convinced that chillies are of exotic origin, you may simply discard it from proposed menu, at the cost of compromising habitual taste. Ayurveda has no problem with exotic plants, as I said in one of my previous posts.  
  

Food items cooked using marica or chilly, without cittaśuddhi of the cook, may cause inconvenience in the consumer. Also, to avoid dṛṣṭidoṣa we recite some verses that was cited in texts like kṣemakutūhalam. However, I agree that these are abstract feelings and beyond scientific observation.  

  
Thanks
