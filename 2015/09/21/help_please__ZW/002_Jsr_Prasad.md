Respected Prof. Nabanarayan Bandyopadhyay ji,  
  

Thank you very much for this valuable information. Yes, as you kindly suggested, the given mantra is somewhat nearer to the queried quotation. Durgacharya's commentary 'बह्वपत्याः' for 'भूरितोकाः' endorses the expression in question. So, can we say that the word 'तोक' in Vedic context, always yield the meaning of 'progeny' as seen in another mantra from Rgveda - अग्ने त्वं पारया नव्यो अस्मान्त्स्वस्तिभिरति दुर्गाणि विश्वा । पूश्च पृथ्वी बहुला न उर्वी भवा **तोकाय तनयाय** शं योः ॥  
  

Regards,
