I would very humbly suggest a bit of a caution. Recently there was a statement by Pravin Togadia ji of VHP that Hindus should have more kids:

Leftist oriented editors may be looking for quotes within Hindu scriptures that go against this understanding.  
  
I don't want to take any sides in the debate on whether Hindus should have more kids or not, but just a small caution that journalists may use quotes by vidvans against Hindu groups. We should ideally not fall for this. Just a suggestion.
