Respected Scholars,  
  

One of my journalist friends has asked me this doubt to locate the original Vedic/Sanskrit source of a quotation - \< *My former very senior colleague on Indian Express and a very famous journalist of our country has found this English sentence quoted by somebody: \`**If a person has many children he succumbs to miseries**.' The person who quoted this sentence says that this is from Rig Veda.*\>. I highly appreciate any relevant information in this regard.  
  

Sincerely,  

Prasad
