Thanks for this alert! I am aware of Sri Pravin Togadia's recent statement on this point. Indeed, after I posted this query, on behalf of someone who I know has sent another remark as follows:  
  
*Regarding the quotation: One of my most revered professors, Prof Thuravoor Viswambharan, also said that this might not be a Vedokti, because, he says, this goes against the soul of Bharatiya beliefs and philosophy. What he feels is that some Westerner, without understanding or digesting the intrinsic import of what the Rishi has said, might have quoted this out of context for serving his own dubious ends.The quoter hasn't located the quotation either. He doesn't give the mandalam, sooktham, etc. which enhances the doubt about his bona fides.  
  
*

This comment attests your feeling truly. By the way, the journalist who asked us this query, is very much right wing oriented, and hence, he sent the above comment later.
