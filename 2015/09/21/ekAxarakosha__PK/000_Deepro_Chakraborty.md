Dear Scholars,

I am looking for Veṇīmādhava Nyāyaratna’s Ekākṣarakoṣa with Gaurīśaṅkara’s commentary that was published from Calcutta in 1874. It is a short lexicon containing words of one syllable. I have a Bengali manuscript of an Ekākṣarakoṣa. The author of this lexicon is not mentioned in this ms. And, this is not thewell-known Ekākṣarakośa authored byPuruṣottamadeva. I just wanted toconfirm if this text is Veṇīmadhava Nyāyaratna’s Ekākṣarakoṣa. Please let me know if any of you have any idea about this text. I can send the ms if you are interested.

Regards,

Deepro.
