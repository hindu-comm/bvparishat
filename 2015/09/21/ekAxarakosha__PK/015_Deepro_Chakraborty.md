Dear Mr. Nagabhushana Rao,

Thank you for your suggestion. Yes, many verses are tallying with Purushottama's Ekaksharakosa.

But it doesn't seem to be the same text.

I wonder if it could beVeṇīmādhava Nyāyaratna’s Ekākṣarakoṣa.

Veṇīmādhava Nyāyaratna belongs to Bengal and this manuscript is also written in Bengali characters.  

  

Regards,

Deepro.
