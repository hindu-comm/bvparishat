Thanks Prof. Kannan. But I guess you meant "guru followed by laghu" and not "laghu followed by guru". Since in the two syllables missing between सकला and नन्दात्मसौख्यम्, the first is supposed to be guru and the second laghu for the new reading to confirm to sragdhara metre. In the possible reading I proposed (सकलानन्दनन्दात्मसौख्यम्), I inserted नन्द between सकला and नन्दात्मसौख्यम्. In नन्द the first is guru and the second laghu.

  

So it should be "guru followed by laghu."
