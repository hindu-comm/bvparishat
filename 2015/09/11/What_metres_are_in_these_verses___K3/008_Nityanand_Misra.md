This verse has three quarters (first, third and fourth) with 21 syllables which confirm to the sragdharā metre. But the second quarter has only 19 syllables. Looks like the scribe missed two syllables, a guru and a laghu, betweenसकला and नन्दात्मसौख्यम्. If it were something likeसकलानन्दनन्दात्मसौख्यम् then the verse would be in the sragdharā metre.
