When I thought of making the reading fit the metre, I added नन्द (guru followed by laghu) between सकला and नन्दात्मसौख्यम् to get सकलानन्दनन्दात्मसौख्यम्.

The same result (सकलानन्दनन्दात्मसौख्यम्) is obtained by adding दनन् (laghu followed by guru) between सकलानन् and दात्मसौख्यम्.

It did not occur to me that you were referring to this second solution. Now that you clarified it, I can say both of us are correct for the respective additions which lead to the same final result.
