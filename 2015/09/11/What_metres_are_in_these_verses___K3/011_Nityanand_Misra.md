This verse has the first, second, and fourth quarter with 11 syllables which conform to the indravajrā, indravajrā and upendravajrā metres respectively. The third quarter is in the indravaṃśāmetre. It can be considered an upajāti but usually in an upajāti only the indravajrā and upendravajrā are mixed. There are some examples where other metres are mixed but very rare.
