Namaste,  
  

There could have been another difficulty to surmount. I find that "निश्चला" means "the Earth" and hence using "निश्चला" as adjective for bhakti or devotion might not have been considered proper and Vedavyasa, in all his wisdom could thought of using "अनिश्चला". May be the ,stalwarts would like to advise.  
  

Regards,
