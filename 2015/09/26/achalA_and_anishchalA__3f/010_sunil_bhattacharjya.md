Adaraniya Prof. Nagarajji,  
  
It is difficult to say about the individual compilers / authors of the puranas except about the Vishnu purana, which was authored by Parashara and the Bhagavata purana, which was authored by Vedavyasa himself. However Vedavyasa probably edited all the puranas towards the end of the Dwapara yuga, at the time when he classified the Vedas.  
  

The Gitasara was reportedly told by the Lord himself to Narada giving the essence of what he told to Arjuna. This should have been not less that 5,000 years ago.  
  

The Mahabharata was composed immediately after the start of the Kali yuga,i.e., around 3102 BCE. As Vedavyasa found that it turned out to be difficult for the lay persons, he wrote the Bhagavata purana about .
Parikshita listened to the Bhagavata purana around 3078 BCE. This means that the Bhagavata purana was composed between 3102 BCE and 3078 BCE. This is according to the chronology of the puranas. The western scholars of the 19th century thought this chronology to be absurd as they thought till the end of the 19th century that the world was created around 4004 BCE. Later on the Indian scholars followed the western scholars meekly, as the former neither had the guts to oppose the latter nor they had any archaeological support, which is available today.
