The verse cited by Shri Sunil Bhattacharjya seems to use the word अनिश्चला in the sense of अचला, निश्चला. This reminds me of a few usages in Marathi. In one of the verses of the Marathi saint poet Ramdas, he says: अचपळ मन माझे नावरे आवरीता, "My mind is very unsteady, and when I try to control it, it cannot be controlled." Here, the expression अचपळ is used in the sense of अतिचपळ. The other usage common in Marathi is the word अपरोक्ष used in the sense of परोक्ष, e.g. त्याने हे माझ्या अपरोक्ष केले, "He did this without letting me know it, behind my back."
In these instances, Marathi is clearly using the expressions अचपल/ळ and अपरोक्ष in opposite meanings these words have in Sanskrit. I wonder if the usage of अनिश्चला in the verse cited by Shri Bhattacharjya falls in the same category.
