As निश्चला means the Earth, can the अनिश्चला भक्ति be referring to spiritual love for the Lord rather the earthly / material love. In other words it is referring not to devotion to the Lord for seeking the material prosperity and happiness, but for the spiritual progress to realize the oneness with the Lord.
