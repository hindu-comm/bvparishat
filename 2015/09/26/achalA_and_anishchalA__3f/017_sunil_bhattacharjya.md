Namaste,  
  

I thank you and the other scholars for the detailed discussion. As regards Bhagavan Vedavyasa, he is an avatara of Lord Vishnu and how can anybody have any doubt about his wisdom. That is why I have been trying to see what could be the reason for using the word अनिश्चला. As regards the word "सुनिश्चला" , is there any possibility that some transcriber at some stage in the past could have found fault with the word अनिश्चला and tried to replace it with सुनिश्चला ?  
  

As regards the word अनिश्चला having the meaning "the Earth" it appears in the following url:  

  
\<<http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/monier/>\>  
  

# निश्चला

**(H3)निश्--चल \[p= [542](http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/cgi-bin/monier/serveimg.pl?file=/scans/MWScan/MWScanjpg/mw0542-niryatna.jpg),3\] \[L=107415\]** *mf*(आ)*n.* motionless , immovable , fixed , steady , invariable , unchangeable MBh. Ka1v. &c **(H3B)निश्--चला \[L=107416\]** *f.* the earth L. **(H3B)निश्--चला \[L=107417\]** *f.* Desmodiuni Gangeticum L.  
  
I was wondering that if अनिश्चला means the Earth, can the अनिश्चला भक्ति be referring to spiritual love for the Lord rather than the earthly / material love.  
  

With best regards,
