Dr. Ramanujan, NamaskAram

You are correct. The second half of Kanva samhita Chapters 21-40 with Sayana Bhashya has been published by Sampurnananda Samskrita Vishva...in their SBG series no.114 (year of Publ.1978). The last Chapter is Ishopanishat with 18 mantras. The chapter beginnings and endings are similar to other Sayanabhashya texts. In the introduction it is said that the text is based on two mss. from Orissa. I have a copy of the book. If some one is deeply interested in the Sayanabhashya of Ch 40, please let me know privately.
