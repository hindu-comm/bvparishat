According to C Ramanujam, the scheme of commentary of Sayana includes complete portion of each Veda:

" Sayana Bhashya is available for all four Vedas covering Samhita, Brahmana, Aranyaka and upanishads."

It should naturally include the popular Upanishads counted as दशोपनिषदः because of Shankaracharya's commentary published many times and those Teachers of Philosophy in relation to their system.

ButvSunil Bhattacharya along with Me. Ajit, maintain that Sayana has written commentaries on the संहिता portion only and not on the Vedanta portion also. So it is not available.

Prof. Ashok Aklujkar has given the details of the commentary of Sayana on छान्दोग्योपनिषत् and now the details commentaries of Sayana on the other Upanishads are to be caught if we are to confirm Ramanujam,'s statement or disprove the authorship of the छान्दोग्योपनिषत् to confirm Sunilj's Statement.

It need not be in the order of Upanishad s published, but could be part of संहिता, ब्राह्मण and आरण्यक in the order the appear in the related Veda and need not numbered and ordered as we see them published, if complete commentary of Sayana is published in the order, if he has written on entire portion.

Then only the question will be solved.
