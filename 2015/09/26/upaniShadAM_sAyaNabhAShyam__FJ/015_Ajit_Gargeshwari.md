Thanks for the clarification. Sayancharya has not commented on the principal upanishads as there were several commentaries before him. His focus was on the Mantra, Brhamana and Arnayaka portions of the vedas. There might be a few upanishads on which he has commented as they appear to be part of the samhita or arnayaka texts.  

As shankaraji has shown there are several printed books with sayana commentaries on the vedas excluding the upanishads and definitely excluding the principal upanishads  

Please note even Prof. Aklujkar mentioned a book which has commentary ascribed to Sayana
