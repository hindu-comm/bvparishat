I have given the reference of Anandashrama series (Sl. no. 036) of Sayana Bhashya covering taittiriya and mahanarayana Upanishads.

The titke is taittiriya Aranyaka bhashya part 2. The pdf file is 20 MB and so difficult to share.

In fact, Shri Ajit has it in ASS collection.

Isavasya seems to be not commented by Sayana, on checking, as Sayana Bhashya is not found for Sukla Yajur Veda, maybe due to an earlier bhashya being available at his time.
