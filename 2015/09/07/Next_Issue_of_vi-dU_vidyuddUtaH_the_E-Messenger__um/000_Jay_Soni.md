Dear Sanskrit Readers,

This issue, number 11, is a report on the WSC in Bangkok 2015 which Professor Hari Dutt Sharma kindly prepared in Sanskrit.

  

Members of the IASS have already seen it. Apologies for the repetition.

  

Hopefully it will interest those seeing it for the first time.

  

You will also find the other 10 issues in the IASS website:

With best wishes,

J. Soni

Secretary General of the IASS
