Dear friends,  

As a follow up of our work on examining the neuro-science of speech production  

we are looking into the late scientific findings on the process of "syllabification."  

The process is not fully understood because of the minute timescales involved  
and the process of grouping together of a lot of connected information to create  
a syllable. We think that the "syllabification" process is different that the eventual  
choice of phonemes. I plan to spend the next two months in looking for any finding  
in Indian texts. Can you help me if an analysis of "madhyamA" stage of speech is  
done in Indian literature?  I will appreciate any broad reference. Of course, I would  

appreciate any research paper that you think would be relevant.  

Thank you.  

Bijoy Misra
