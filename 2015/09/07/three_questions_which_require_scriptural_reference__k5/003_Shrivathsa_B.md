hariH OM,  
shrii niihar,

 I don't know about puraaNic justification for spider = lakShmii. But I have read somewhere that the total mass of insects eaten away by spiders is more than 9 times the total mass of all humans. That spiders are beneficial to humans should have been obvious to our forefathers.

 In southern India there is opprobrium associated with killing house geckos and lizards. The varadarAja temple of kAnciipuram has the figurines of lizards one in gold and another in silver which is supposed to expiate the sin of having killed lizards (common belief. There may be some sthala puraaNa justification).

 Same goes for snakes. I am told that some vaishyas of Madhya Pradesh call snakes using epithets of nAnA ji, chAchA ji etc and don't call them as "saaMp". There is also the belief of naaga doSha (when a snake is killed) as practiced in the south. The contribution of snakes to food security can never be understated. Rodents eat away and sully about 6% of food grains stored (ref: <http://www.fao.org/wairdocs/x5002e/x5002e02.htm> )

 All the above paints a picture of our forefathers being keenly conscious of the contribution of our arachnid and reptilian friends to our wellbeing.

svasti,  
 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,  
 shrivathsa.
