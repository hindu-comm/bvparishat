Dear Respected Scholars,

Pranam from Kashi!

I am a scholar of Kashmira shaivaagama. 

  

It is enlightening to read your comments on various topics.

  

I was wondering if scholars can help me with three questions which require scriptural reference.

  

Three questions are as under-



1.  How to properly place or display a shiva lingam.  Would anyone
    know, a reference to the verse of theIndian scripture*Aagama
    Shastra*, or any other scripture, which states that the Shiva Lingam
    should face East and hence the Gomukhi (drain) should face North?



2.  How to display a conch (shankha). Would anyone know scriptural
    reference which says that: 



1.  aconch should always be displayed or placed face up; that is,
    revealing the open part of the conch,
2.  a conch should face toward the east direction; that is, the open,
    pointed end of the conch should face toward the east



3.  Do we have any scriptural story or text or references which
    establish a*verifiable and authentic connection between Goddess
    Maha Lakshmi and spiders*?

Traditionally it is heard that the spider (makdi) is a sign of Maha Lakshmi's presence and for that reason, one should take care not to harm a spider and see it as an auspicious sign.

  

I have met pandits who tell me that this is how it is done in the tradition but I would like to support the tradition with a scriptural reference, any help would be very supportive.

  

Thanking you all once again.

  

With love

and respect
