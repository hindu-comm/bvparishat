Thank you Shrivathsa ji.

Any idea about the other two questions, one regarding direction on shiva lingam and other regarding the conch?Both these questions are very relevant in pujas as it would be nice to have a scriptural backing on what we are following in our sanantana tradition.

  

Thank you!

  

With love,
