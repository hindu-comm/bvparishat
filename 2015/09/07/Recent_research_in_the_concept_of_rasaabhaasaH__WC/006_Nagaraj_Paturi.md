There are at least two instances of rasAbhAsa situations of the original purANic storyconsidered to have been attempted tobe changed intonon-rAsAbhAsa i.e. sRngAra rasa situations by the sixteenth century TelugukAvya -poets through their narrative poetic technique:



1\. In Manucharitra of Peddana, in varUthinIpravarasamvAda episode, varUthinI being mAnavEtarA isone of the bases of rasAbhAsa apart from EkarAga. Peddana attempts to resolve the mAnavEtaratva basis through the verse:



animEshatvamu mAnpe .....



2\. In Vasucharitra of Bhattumurti/Ramarjabhushanuduin s'uktimatIkOlAhala episode, s'uktimatI being a river one of the bases of rasAbhAsa apart from EkarAga. Bhattumurti/Ramarjabhushanuduattempts to resolve the mAnavEtaratva basis through s'lEsha inthe verses
