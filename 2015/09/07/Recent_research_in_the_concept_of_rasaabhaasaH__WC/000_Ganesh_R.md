Dear and respected scholars,

I am interested to know the recent research, if any, that has been done on the concept of rasaabhaasaH in Indian aesthetics since the time of stalwarts like P. V. Kane, S. K. De, V. Raghavan, K. Krishnamoorthy,
P. Sriramachandrudu and others. Can you please enlighten me with the recent studies on it?

As I am quite familiar with what all has been said on this topic by the masters such as Anandavardhana, Abhinavagupta, BhOja, SimhabhUpaala, Vishvanaatha, Shaaradaatanaya, Vidyasdhara and the like, I need only a further research and fresh material on it. Sorry to bother you all with such specifications. But this only to focus the discussions and save time as well as energy of this learned group.

With utmost regards

Ganesh
