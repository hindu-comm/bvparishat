There are many such humorous situations .

  

A fellow claimed that the Veda-s contain all knowledge. His friend asked him whether the name of his maid servant is also there, saying her name was Thimmamma.

Pat came the reply :

*apaghnan nirR**tim mama !!***

*  
*

Yet another fellow said his own name (Ananta Rao) occurs in the Veda, and cited

*paryAptyA **anantarAyA**ya etc.*

*  
*

The very word *pariah*, it is said, occurs in the Gita :

*kRpayA **parayA**vis"Tam.*

*  
*

The Gita is so advanced that it has contemporary relevance in unexpected manners . It has something to say about computer ethics too : Never direct any virus against anyone -

*nir**vairus** sarva-bhUtes"u.*

*  
*

There can be no end to such instances .
