This sukta has in all 12 Rks, from three different places in RV.

First nine Rks are continuous and from RV 8.81.1 to 8.81.9 (आ तू न इन्द्र क्षुमन्तं) - ऐन्द्रम्

10^(th) Rk is RV 2.023.01 – गणानां त्वा - ब्राह्मणस्पत्यं

11^(th) and 12^(th) are – RV 10.112.09 and 10.112.10 नि षु सीद गणपते .. , अभिख्या नो मघवन् .. - ऐन्द्रम्

I have gone through the Sayana Bhashya of all these 12 rks. but there is nothing to even suggest these as gaNapati Sukta.

8.81.1 has the word 'महाहस्ती', \[referring to big-handed Indra, as per SayaNa\], which might possibly why somebody thought of it as referring to Ganesa.
