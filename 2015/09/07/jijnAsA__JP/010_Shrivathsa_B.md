hariH OM,  
  
 the use of jAtavedase for durgA and gaNAnAntvA for gaNapati, ApyAyasva for ApaH etc. can be justified by the rUpasaMRRiddhi concept as enunciated by brAhmaNas. Hence it is not too far from vedic practice. Any karma will have better result if it has rUpasamRRiddhi. i.e. the name of the deity being present in the mantra.  
  

svasti,  

 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,  

 shrivathsa.
