That cannot be called bhrama. The Vedic deities gradually evolved into puraaNic ones. Pl see the preface to the book "Hymns to the Mystic Fire" by Aurobindo for a more detailed explanation.

Yet, for this Mantra, गणानां त्वा like other mantra-s, has a fixed deity and it is different from Puranic Ganesha also called गणपति. In this case, it is ब्रह्मणस्पति, which is not used as synonym for Ganesha after Puranic evolution. In Vedic context, the deity is considered as बृहस्पति also who is deity of several other mantra-s. One can refer to the commentaries also in this matter.

Here in the case of invoking Ganapati in the worship of Ganesha, the Vighnavinayaka, it is conveniently used because of the similarity of the name occurred in the Mantra. This is the case of several other mantra-s also.

For example, the Mantra,

ig Veda Book 1 Hymn 99.*जातवेदसे सुनवाम*सोममरातीयतो नि दहाति वेदः \|  
स नः पर्षदति दुर्गाणि विश्वा नावेव सिन्धुं दुरितात्यग्निः।।

is obviously is relating to Agni and the prayer is to the Vedic deity.

It is used in worshipping Durga, probably because of the word दुर्गा occurring in the Mantra? Otherwise it is defended as it as Agni form of Durga, defending it by Tantric concept and made identical with Puranic Durga. Some more mantra-s could be quoted offhand.
