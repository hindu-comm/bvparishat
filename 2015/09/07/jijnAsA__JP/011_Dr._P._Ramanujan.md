Reg. Shrivatsa's post

\>\> the use of jAtavedase for durgA and gaNAnAntvA for gaNapati, ApyAyasva for ApaH etc. can be justified by the rUpasaMRRiddhi concept as enunciated by brAhmaNas. Hence it is not too \>\> far from vedic practice. Any karma will have better result if it has rUpasamRRiddhi. i.e. the name of the deity being present in the mantra.  

...

Actually, the next mantra in TA has

तामग्निवर्णां तपसा ज्वलन्तीं वैरोचनीं कर्मफलेषु जुष्टाम् ।

दुर्गां देवीँ शरणमहं प्रपद्ये सुतरसितरसे नमः ।।



Regarding Prof. Bhat's Post -



\>\> Here in the case of invoking Ganapati in the worship of Ganesha, the Vighnavinayaka, it is conveniently used because of the similarity of the name occurred in the Mantra.

\>\> This is the case of several other mantra-s also.

\>\> Some more mantra-s could be quoted offhand.



In fact, it is said that, during Sri Rajiv Gandhi's time, one vaidika told him that his name appears in the Vedas as

आत्मा यक्ष्मस्य नश्यति पु **रा जीव**गृभो यथा । TS !!



Some say अध्वना **मध्वपते** श्रेष्ठस्याध्वनः पारमशीय in TB has similarity to Shri Madhvacharya!
