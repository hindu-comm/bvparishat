hariH OM,

 Svaami Rangapriya Deshikendra used to joke that Unani has Vedic roots. :-) because of:  
agne naya supathA rAye vishvAni deva vay**unAni** vidvAn.

 also that the science of rythms has Vedic roots. Because of: "taddhi tapastaddhi tapaH" :-)  

svasti,  
 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,  
 shrivathsa.
