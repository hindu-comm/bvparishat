Dear Scholars!



A friend of mine is desirous of knowing if any literature related to textiles, like types of materials for clothes, their weaving,

preparation, design principles etc.are available in Sanskrit and references be suggested.



I request this forum of experts to respond with details.



Regards



Ramanujan
