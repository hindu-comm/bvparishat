Dear Sir,  
  

Before scholars respond, I would like to add this piece of information. Sri Suresh Soni in his book, 'India's Glorious Scientific Tradition' discusses ancient Indian achievements in garment technology in a separate chapter. Foreigners does not know how to manufacture clothes out of the cotton, during their regime in India. The chapter do not provide any references/citations to the details that you have asked. But the author refers to ṛṣi 'gṛtsnamada' as the inventor/discloser of this technology. He also refers to some historical accounts of this science taking examples of Al-Biruni etc.  
  

I can scan and sent those three pages, if need be.  
  

Regards,  

Prasad
