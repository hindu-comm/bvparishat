Dear Hari Parshad Ji,

  

  I am curious aboutŚabda-kaustubha-dūṣana of Shri Bhaskar Dikshit that you are looking for. If you do get a copy, or any information about this text, please pass it on to me. I have not heard of this text. I have seen references to a text titled Śabdakaustubhaśāṇottejana written by Jagannātha Paṇḍita attacking the Śabdakaustubha. But this has not been published, and evidently exists in manuscript form somewhere.
