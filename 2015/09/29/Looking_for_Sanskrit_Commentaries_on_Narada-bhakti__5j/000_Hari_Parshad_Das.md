\~\~ śrī-śrī-rādhā-dāmodarāya namaḥ \~\~  
  
dear vidvaj-janas,  
  
my pranams.  
  
i am looking for a few books (softcopy preferred):  
  
1) Any Sanskrit commentaries on Narada-bhakti-sutras (I am not sure if Svapneshvara Acharya has written a commentary on it but if someone has it, it will be great).  
  
2) Śabda-kaustubha-dūṣana of Shri Bhaskar Dikshit.  
  
If anyone has any softcopies or websites/shops where I can order physical copies, please let me know.  
  
My thanks in advance.  
  
sādhu-caraṇa-rajo 'bhilāṣī,
