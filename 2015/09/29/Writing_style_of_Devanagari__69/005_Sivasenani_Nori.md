Ma'am

This convention of writing in Roman alphabet deserves to be understood with sympathy.

In English, unlike in say German, compound words are written with a space in between them. Thus civil-servant is written as civil servant. So people used to reading Roman letters treat space as if it does not exist, like we do with hyphens. We all agree that a hyphen makes long samaasas easier to understand. Example: अनधिगत-अबाधित-अर्थ-विषयक-ज्ञानत्वं प्रमा। So for them jaanaamy ushe = jaanaamyushe. They feel that jaanaamy ushe is better than jaanaami ushe because the former captures additional sandhi information. That "i" and "y" could be similarly pronounced is a happy coincidence for them. If I were to write Sanskrit using the Urdu script, I would have to use the same character to mean different syllables (basically for different vowels) and write right to left but those are the features of my orthography and it would be pointless to be judgemental.

In case of people writing in Roman, if anything, we should appreciate those who incorporate sandhi rules more than those who do not.
