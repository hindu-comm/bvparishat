Thank you very much Prof. Deshpande.  
  

I am looking at this phenomenon only from automatic processing point of view. When I use texts in IAST or some romanised form, I know that the space is only for ease of pronunciation. This space also provides me a hint as to where to split the unsandhied text.  
  

In case of a Devanagari text, I always get a text that is partially in unsandhied form and partially in sandhied form, and many a times it may not be clear which one is in sandhied form and which part is in unsandhied form. This definitely adds to the complexity in processing. Therefore I was wondering whether there are any principles which the editors might have adapted (may be unconsciously). If there are any such principles, they may be considered as a patch over the Panini's grammar, which might be useful for processing such a mixed string.  
  
with regards,  

Amba
