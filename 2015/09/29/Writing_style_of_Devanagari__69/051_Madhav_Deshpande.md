Dear Amba,

  

  I have attached a photograph of two folios of the manuscript of Mantramahodadhi in my personal collection. As you can see, the manuscript is written in a completely Saṃhitā mode, without any gaps between words anywhere. If you compare this manuscript with the printed editions of Mantramahodadhi, you can easily see what the editors have done in presenting the same text in a modern way of writing/printing Sanskrit. The Nirnayasagara pothi prints are closer in style to the manuscripts, but not entirely so, as they too are affected by the writing patterns of Marathi, and also of the printing styles of English. Many of the early printed Sanskrit books were edited by colonial officials who were in charge of the Bombay Sanskrit and Prakrit Series (Peterson, Kielhorn, Buhler etc.), publications of the Asiatic Society of Calcutta, and publications of the Benares Sanskrit College (F.E. Hall and others). The same is true of the Punjab Oriental Series published from Lahore, edited by scholars like Cowell.
