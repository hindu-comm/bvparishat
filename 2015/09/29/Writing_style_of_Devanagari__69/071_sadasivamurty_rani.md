Now I come back to make an attempt to answer the root question. This has already been well answered by Prof. Korada Subrahmanyam Garu and other scholars after a thorough discussion having shed light on great many Pramana vakyas.

I would like to add my content to the context:

  

The question of Dr. Usha is that in the following illustrations if a split takes place can such broken part be considered as a padam or not?

Before answering this question we should concentrate on the occasions where such splitting is felt necessary.

As far as my observations go while typing the modern Theses in Devanagari Script there shall be some justification problem with the typed matter to maintain the margins of the page vertically straight without allowing any protrusions of a letter or letters. in such case most of the researchers cling to this type of splitting:

  

Dr. Usha has given us three choices to show support from:

1\. Any Grammatical Rule

2\. Any Phonetic Rule

3\. Sishta Accepted Rule  
  

If thesis writing is an example for Sishta Accepted Rule

then the analysis of the possibilities whether to accept Padtva or not can be decided in the following manner

1. जानाम्य् उषे - Cannot be considered: It is phonetically a wrong splitting:

2\. प्रवृत्तिर् अध्ययनरूपा - This is as per Sishtabhyaasa (In the theses for Margin Justification purpose accepted) by hyphenating thisप्रवृत्तिर्- at the end of the previous line and then in the beginning of the next lineअध्ययनरूपा\|

  

3\. काचिन् निषादी - Grammatically Wrong splitting (By virtue of AnunAsika sandhi ruleयरोऽनुनासिकॆऽनुनासिको वा the optional form can beकाचिद् निषादी and notकाचिन् निषादी\| This is also normally accepted for Margin Justification purpose in the Ph.D theses.

  

4\. स्याद् इति - The Questioner her self asked to ignore this.

  

5\. वस्तुतस् तु - Inconvenient Splitting.

  

6\. शिष्टाचारो’ प्यधुनासमये’ ग्निहोत्र... Here apostrophe mark is used forऽ - अकारप्रश्लेषप्रयोग। It can be replaced by it in stead of using the apostrophe mark.

  

7प्रमाणतायास् तान्त्रिकैर् व्यवस्थापनात्

विरचितो’ यं - This is also normally done on the occasion of Margin Justification in the Ph. D theses.

  

  

Before I conclude I would like to discuss on one point i.e. about the example of :1. जानाम्य् उषे - Cannot be considered: It is phonetically a wrong splitting:

Why this considered a Phonetically wrong splitting?

Here we should take the account given in the Rk Pratisakhya.

There is a discussion on the Angatva of an Anusvara and Vyanjana:

1\. अनुस्वारो व्यञ्जनं चाक्षराङ्गम् ।

When either Anusvara or a Vyanjana is preceded by a Vowel (Akshara is a Vowel only स्वरोऽक्षरम् and सव्यञ्जनस्सानुस्वारो शुद्धो वा स्वरोऽक्षरम्।) such Anusvara or Vyanjana should be a part of that preceding Vowel only.

  

2\. स्वारान्तरे व्यञ्जनान्युत्तरस्य। If the Vyanjana is in between two vowels it should be the beginning part of the succeeding Vowel and not of the previous Vowel.

  

3\. पूर्वस्यानुस्वारविसर्जनीयौ।But the Anusvara and Visarjaniya become the parts of the preceding Vowel only even when they fall between two vowels.

  

4\. संयोगादिर्वा। If there is a combined or doubled consonants between two vowels the first consonant should be the part of the preceding vowel and the second consonant should be the part of the succeeding vowel.

These rules are applicable in this context.

All this is acceptable in above said manner mostly in the process of Margin Justification while typing our Theses in Devanagari Script.

I request the scholars to suggest me if any corrections are necessary in my views. Thanks to all in advance.

Warm regards,



**Dr. Rani Sadasiva Murty**
