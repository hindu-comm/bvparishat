There is a wonderful discussion going on on this topic providing high quality material for researchers to develop many theses on this topic.

I have seen some of the postings and tired to see the others. Such has been the rush in attending this issue.

I don't know whether the doubt which I am going to express has its references in others' mails also or not yet I would like to present it for the consideration of the scholars.

1. Is this question in discussion related to Devanagari writing style or Sanskrit phonetic presentation style in any script? To be more clear - "Won't the problem focussed in this discussion occur if the passage is written in other than Devanagari i.e. Roman script or any other regional script?"

  

2. If this problem occurs while writing the passage in other regional or Roman scripts also can this be problem of Devananagari only? or of the other scripts too?

  

3. In such case is this a problem with script or Sanskrit phonetic principles?

  

I request the scholars to enlighten.

Regards,

**Dr. Rani Sadasiva Murty**

Namaste

Here is a question on a particular writing style of Devanagari Samskrt.

Can a Samskrt word be broken as shown below ?

स्याद् इति 

वस्तुतस् तु

शिष्टाचारो’ प्यधुनासमये’ ग्निहोत्र...

प्रमाणतायास् तान्त्रिकैर् व्यवस्थापनात्

विरचितो’ यं

Can the broken part be considered as a पदम्?

Is there any grammatical/phonetic/SiShTa accepted rule which supports this writing system?

Thank you, in advance, for all the replies.
