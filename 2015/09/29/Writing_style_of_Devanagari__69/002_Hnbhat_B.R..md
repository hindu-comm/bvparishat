I think there is no rule for writing system in Grammar. But only

  

संहितैकपदे नित्या नित्या धातूपसर्गयोः।

नित्या समासे वाक्ये तु सा विवक्षामपक्षते॥  

  

In writing, sentences, it is left to the descretion of the writer's choice. वाक्ये तु सा विवक्षामपेखते।

  

Whether you follow roman script, it can conveniently be split as you have split.

  

jānāmy uṣe

pravṛttir adhyayanarūpā

kācin niṣādī

  

But the choice is yours. No rule says you should join them.

  

It is your convenience in writing and reading, but grammar does not provide rule for writing. The sandhi is optional in a sentence as per the rule quoted, but it does not say anything how you write in roman or devanagari.

  

Some may like as you have written. Others may like otherwise in Devanagari, for facilitating reading fluently.

  

जानाम्युषे

प्रवृत्तिरध्ययनरूपा

काचिन्निषादी

स्यादिति etc.

  

It is left to their choice, like गङ्गा and गंगा etc. written alternatively, and preferred गंगा over the other by modern readers/users of Devanagari.

  

Grammar does not prescribe any rule.
