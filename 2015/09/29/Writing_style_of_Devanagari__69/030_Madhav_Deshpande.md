Dear Amba,

  

  Your observation, "Similarly I often come acrossरामोगच्छति instead ofरामःगच्छति ? andयतोहि instead ofयतःहि ? andतेइह instead ofतइह ?" is very correct, and reflects the current style of writing and printing Sanskrit. The technology of printing Devanagari developed during the British colonial period, and the notion of leaving gaps between Sanskrit words, where possible, was a result of the editorial decisions made during the colonial period. If you look at the handwritten manuscripts, most of them show no gaps between words anywhere, and this is the case with most inscriptions. So, in part, we are dealing with norms of representing Sanskrit that developed during the colonial period. Whether those norms conform to or reflect Pāṇinian grammar is a different question. However, these modern norms are found everywhere in the modern printed editions of Sanskrit texts, though these editions are based on manuscripts that show no gaps between words. This is the case of the printed Vedic Saṃhitā texts as well, while the word Saṃhitā refers to a form of recitation that is continuous, without gaps. Simplification or ease of reading may have been the principle motivation in introducing gaps in written and printed Sanskrit, and they clearly do not reflect the ancient notions of sandhi or saṃhitā.
