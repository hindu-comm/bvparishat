Thank you very much Prof. Korada ji for detailed explanation.  
  

So in sa.mhitaa I write रामोवनङ्गच्छति but when I undo the sandhi between padas and introduce a pause between them, I get रामः वनम् गच्छति.  
  

But I have often seen people insisting me to write it as रामः वनं गच्छति.  

  

Similarly I often come across रामो गच्छति instead of रामः गच्छति ? and यतो हि instead of यतः हि ? and ते इह instead of त इह ?  
  

I would like to have clarification regarding these examples.  

  

Thanks and regards,  

Amba Kulkarni
