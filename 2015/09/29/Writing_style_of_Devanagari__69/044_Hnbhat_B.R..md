Thanks for the development of printing convention till the 20th century the Nirnayasagar as the standard model as we are used to wriite. Even in the mixed style of writinng of with and regulated space, they use modern punctuation marks of English, like colon dash, quotation marks, comma in addition to the normal "danda" which facilitated the common reader/scholars to easily grasp the readers/scholars, without violating the grammatical conventions. Now readers seem to revert back to the system गुणैर् ईष्टे/इष्टे and the like the roman script printing. The option of Sandhi, in a sentence seems to be conveyed by the use of punctuation marks, comma, semi-colon, dash, colon-dash etc. where the संहिता is not made generally. The use of quotation mark presented some problem, in some quoted portion and the following इति where it is used. तदुक्तं कुल्लूकभट्टेन --- ".........गुणि"रिति or "....गुणैः" इति। The second is preferred in some prints.
