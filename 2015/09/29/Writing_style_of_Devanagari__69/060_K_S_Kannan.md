Ancient Greek too had *scripta continua*. No space between words, or even sentences.

  

Read this Wiki note :

  

[Ancient Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek "Ancient Greek")was written*[scripta ontinua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripta_continua "Scripta continua")*without[spacing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(typography) "Space (typography)")or[interpuncts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpunct "Interpunct"). Over time, a variety of symbols appeared. A system of dots credited to[Aristophanes of Byzantium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristophanes_of_Byzantium "Aristophanes of Byzantium")was developed in the 3rd centuryBC: a[low dot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypostigme "Hypostigme")⟨.⟩marked an occasion for a short breath after a short phrase, a[middot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stigme_mese "Stigme mese")⟨·⟩marked an occasion for a longer breath after a longer passage, and a[high dot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stigme_teleia "Stigme teleia")⟨˙⟩marked a full stop at the end of a completed thought. Other writers employed[two dot punctuation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_dot_punctuation "Two dot punctuation")⟨⁚⟩to mark the ends of sentences or changing speakers. Less often, arrangements of three⟨⁝⟩, four⟨⁞⟩and⟨⁘⟩, and five dots⟨⁙⟩appeared. Such interline punctuation could be noted or replaced by a variety of[paragraphoi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paragraphoi "Paragraphoi"), long marks which trailed between lines of text; these might also mark changes of speakers. Blank lines or various[coronides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editorial_coronis "Editorial coronis")marked the ends of sections. (A separate[coronis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronis_(diacritic) "Coronis (diacritic)")was used to mark[contractions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crasis "Crasis"); its early forms looked like an apostrophe between the two ellided words.) Over time, the main punctuation came to be a[full stop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop "Full stop")marked by a single dot at varying heights, a[partial stop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicolon "Semicolon")marked by various forms of[commas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma "Comma"), and the[hypodiastole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypodiastole "Hypodiastole")⟨⸒⟩and[papyrological hyphen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papyrological_hyphen "Papyrological hyphen")⟨‿⟩or⟨͜⟩. These served to show whether an ambiguous series of letters should be read as (respectively) a single word or as a pair of words.^([\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_orthography#cite_note-nicky-1))

Following the[advent of printing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printing#History "Printing"), most Greek punctuation was gradually standardized with[French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_punctuation "French punctuation"): the[hypodiastole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypodiastole "Hypodiastole")was fully unified with the comma, the[comma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma "Comma")serves as the[decimal point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_point "Decimal point")(and in this use is called the "hypodiastole"), the[full stop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop "Full stop")serves as the[thousands separator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thousands_separator "Thousands separator"), and[guillemets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guillemet "Guillemet")and[em-length](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Em_dash "Em dash")[quotation dashes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_dash "Quotation dash")typically serve to indicate direct speech.^([\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_orthography#cite_note-3))The principal difference is the[Greek question mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_question_mark "Greek question mark")⟨;⟩, which developed a shape so similar to the[Latinate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_script "Latin script")[semicolon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicolon "Semicolon")⟨;⟩that[Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode "Unicode")decomposes its separate code point identically.^([\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_orthography#cite_note-nicky-1))The[ano teleia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ano_teleia "Ano teleia")middot serves as the Greek semicolon but is so uncommon that it has often been left off of Greek[keyboards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_keyboard "Computer keyboard").^([\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_orthography#cite_note-lookgreek-2))
