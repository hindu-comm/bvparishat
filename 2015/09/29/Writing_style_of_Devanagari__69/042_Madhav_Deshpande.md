Dear Amba,

  

  For the origins of the current practice of printing/writing Sanskrit in partially unsandhied fashion, one would need to look up the introductions to the oldest Devanagari editions of Sanskrit texts, edited by scholars like Max Muller, Whitney, Weber, Franz Bopp etc., as well as Indian editor/publishers like Nirnayasagara, Jibanand Vidyasagar etc. In the practice of Nirnayasagara Press, several texts printed in the pothi style were printed like Sanskrit manuscripts, namely without any gaps between any words, and subsequently they switched to the modern style that we are familiar with. In the first few pages of Lanman's Sanskrit Reader, we find segments like उपपन्नो गुणैर् इष्टै..., where the "r" resulting from a sandhi is shown with a gap between words. This was done obviously to ease the comprehension of the beginning students of Sanskrit. After the first few pages, this practice is no longer followed, as the students are expected to become familiar with the phenomenon of sandhi by then. In more recent times, authors like \[late\] G.B. Palsule promoted greater use of visandhi writing of Sanskrit, while my more traditional teachers like \[late\] Pandit N.N. Bhide did not approve of this practice, though even he did not object to leaving a gap between रामो गच्छति. This style of writing/printing had become the norm by then, while something like गुणैर् इष्टै might still be considered unacceptable.
