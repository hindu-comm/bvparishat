I have attached photograph of two pages from the Nirnayasagara edition of Nārāyaṇabhaṭṭa's Prayogaratna, where one can see the mixed style of printing Sanskrit, sometimes with gaps between words and sometimes without any gaps, as one normally finds in the manuscripts. Gradually, in the editions in the Kāvyamālā series for example, we do not find this mixed style, but the NSP has by then opted for the more modern style of leaving gaps between words where possible, while giving sandhied expressions in some places.
