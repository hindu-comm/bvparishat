An interesting discussion is going on writing style. However there must have been a way to indicate different words in the writing styles adopted by our ancients when they started using lipi. Because sometimes a continuous chain style of writing causes an ambiguity. The early lekhakas would have resorted to some kind of separating symbol to resolve such issues. What are they? For example, a sentence such as:

  

राम, गृहं गच्छ। \[here राम is the vocative expression\]

  

when written without any word separation may look like:

  

रामगृहं (गच्छ)।

  

And it conveys a different sense.

So there must be some notation. Otherwise many texts will be incomprehensible.
