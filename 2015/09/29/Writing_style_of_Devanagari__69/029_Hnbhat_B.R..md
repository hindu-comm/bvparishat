The sequence रामोवनं could be split as रामः अवनम्, not वन where there is no water or अवनं protection, if the context needs and otherwise रामः वनम्, which again calls grammatical exigency. If the other option as we usually writing without space, leaves no doubt that it means Rama goes to forest. That much clear. "पयः कीलालममृतं जीवनं भुवनं वनम् ॥ ३२३ ॥" it may mean Rama goes to water. (river). Only splitting the words for facility does not clear doubts in all places.

  

So the last option will be

  

रामोवनङ्गच्छति। to be grammatically correct परः संनिकर्षः संहिता to परस्सन्निकर्षस्संहिता.

  

In the सूत्र, the विसर्ग takes place in विसर्ग only in संहिता, "8-3-36 वा शरि" where both are संहिताकार्य.
