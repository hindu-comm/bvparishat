Once thanks to Shri HN Bhat Ji. Sir, from the answers I received from you I shall

re-present them in the way I understood your material to pave a way to give expression to my thoughts.

  

1. Whether it is Devanagari or Roman Script or Granthi Script or Sharada or Nevari or Nandi Nagari - All these as you said have their respective sets of characters (to represent all possible speech sounds of Sanskrit). From script to script these characters may vary in shape but the sounds represented by those characters are the same. For instance: The basicअ in Devanagari is అ in Telugu,  அ in Tamil, അ in Malayalam, અ in Gujarati, ਅ in Punjabi and so on. An observation of illustration hints us that the same speech sound is represented through different characters in different scripts. The same can be a matter to be understood with regard to the the characters or signs used in the scripts such as Granthi or Sharada or Nevari or Nandi Nagari etc.

  

As in case of isolated units of speech sounds the phonemic units resulted from the phonetic conjunctions in Sanskrit too can be represented alike by all these scripts with character-shape variation. What I mean is the shape of character (script wise) may differ the phonetic unit represented by it is the same in each instance.

  

Hence I would like to know whether it is right or wrong if I draw a conclusion that as far as the writing style is concerned it need not be confined to Devanagari only but it can be extended to other scripts also in representing All Possible Sanskrit Speech sounds.

  

2\. Now my thoughts further find breath in your supporting statements such as:

"the scribe need not be a scholar always and the scholars who use those manuscripts for learning, did not find the necessity of punctuation at all as an inflectional language, all the words are self explanatory."

  

From this instance what I would like to say is - if two or more word units or all the word units in a sentence are found written without any intervening spacing it need not be taken as an instance of Not observing the Punctuation rules by our predecessors. Instead we can say that they depend on scribes' habit only.

  

3. Basing on these I would like to add a few of my thoughts related to the present topic:

Our predecessors - Ancient Seers, have a definite idea of the following concepts.

1. While uttering even VARNAS they suggested us to utter giving sufficient spacing between a VARNA and its succeeding VARNA while performing JAPA with uttering MANTRAS.

मन: संहृत्य विषयात् मन्त्रार्थगतमानस:।

नद्रुतं न विलम्बं च जपेत् मौक्तिकपङ्क्तिवत्॥.

  

Similar is the case with the words, Samasas and Sentences also.  

This illustration helps to infer the spacing awareness of the seers between a syllable and syllable, word and word and sentence and sentence.

  

To say further:

"विरामोऽवसानम्" is another instance which is an evidence to say how punctuation minded our seers were.  

  

Another instance form the Ramayana can help us to estimate the verse - punctuation knowledge also of our Sages. Here is a sloka from the Balakanda of the Ramayana uttered by Valmiki.

  

पादबद्धोऽक्षरसम: तन्त्रीलयसमन्वित:।

शॊकार्तस्य प्रवृत्तोऽयं श्लोको भवतु नान्यथा॥

  

This sloka is a clear instance of the punctuation knowledge of Slokas of
those seers.

Similarly ""यतिर्विच्छेदसंज्ञक:" is another instance which suggests the writers to give adequate space even in the middle of the running of a metrical compositions. Many illustrations are found through out the Lakshana granthas on Prosody, Siksha and Sangita regulating the punctuation marks. Of course those punctuation marks need not be the same with the western punctuation marks. We have our own marks.

  

So if these ancient principles are ignored need it be taken as a generalized principle that our ancient language users didn't maintain the required spacing between the word and word, sentence and sentence and so on or can we consider them as scribes' habit of some generations which were even ignored by the then scholars?

  

Now I have to add my findings regarding the doubts of Dr. Usha for which I shall take one more occasion probably by tomorrow.

  

Warm regards to all,

**Dr. Rani Sadasiva Murty**
