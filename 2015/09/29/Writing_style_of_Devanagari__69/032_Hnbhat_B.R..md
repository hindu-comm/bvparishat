The question raised is of the splitting of words even when in संहिता form with word space, recently.

  

And the question modified as to whether परः संनिकर्षः includes the writing of joining without word space in writing practice रामो वनं गच्छति,रामो वनङ् गच्छतिor रामोवनंगच्छति, or रामोवनङ्गच्छति, in addition to using the option वाक्ये विवक्षामपेक्षते as रामः वनम् गच्छति even in a sentence, not only in श्लोकः and श्लोकपादः where traditionally splitting is seen in श्लोकार्ध and not even in श्लोकपादः which is considered as पद. The preference of writing with word space is questioned even in Sandhi.

  

"पदप्रकृतिः संहिता (निरु. पू. 6 खं. 17)" in Vedic Samhitaa.

  

And you have quoted the Vamana's dictum and more.
