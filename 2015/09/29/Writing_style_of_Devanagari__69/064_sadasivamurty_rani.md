At the outset I should thank Shri HN Bhat ji. Sir, as I observe, your replies are always brief, accurate and to the point. I have never seen you exceeding the limits of propriety of context. This time also you have maintained the same balance. You were the first one to answer Dr. Usha's present question.

  

Of course I proceed further with my second phase of doubts before I present what I would like to add to this context.

  

As I observe the role ofसंहिताs established here by almost all scholars in the process of giving a reply to this present question. Yes it is essential also. But the result ofसंहिताor phonetic conjunction can be invariable (नित्य) or optional (विकल्प).

1. When the effect of phonetic conjunction is invariable(नित्य), in all scripts may it be Devanagari or Roman or Telugu or Tamil or any other scripts such as Granthi or Sarada, is it written alike are differently in spite of the deficiency of representing all characters as in case of Tamil (where such sounds are substituted by the available sounds in that script)?

  

2\. When the effect of phonetic conjunction is optional (विकल्प) are all the possible optional results as per the Paninian prescriptions used by us in our normal writings or are we habituated to use only one or two possible optionals as per our convenience?

Ex:

ककुम्नेता/ककुब्नेता

वाङ्महिमा/वाग्महिमा

रामस्थाता or रामस्स्थाता or राम: स्थाता

हरिस्फुरति or हरिस्स्फुरति or हरि:स्फुरति

सञ्छिव: or सञ्च्छिव: or सञ्शिव:

Do we use all these options? When we use only a few forms as per our convenience don't all the rest of the possible optionals disappear from the vision of the normal users who couldn't have any chance to specialize in Sanskrit Vyakarana Sastra?

Can this kind of instances stand as examples for historical survival?

  

While writing these optional variations shouldn't all the scripts in vogue follow similar patterns or should they differ?

  

Let not the deficiency of characters be a criterion to differentiate the writing style here because when such deficiency is there the scribes of that language don't skip the characters but substitute them with the available characters and read them with their due sthana and prayatna only.  

  

3\. In the manuscripts of past centuries, if proper punctuation rules were not followed while writing, was it scribes' inefficiency (may be of one generation or of a series of generations) or the very language's recommendation?

  

I request the scholars to help me in getting enlightened.

Warm regards,

**Dr. Rani Sadasiva Murty**
