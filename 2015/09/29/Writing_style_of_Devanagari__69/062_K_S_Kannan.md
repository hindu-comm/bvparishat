One of the most complex problems to handle in Natural Language Processing is marking off word-boundaries, the hardest being the **spoken** material (any language). The notorious Problem of Juncture as it is called, it is quite common even in **written** sentences in Sanskrit.

  

A simple example is:

*na tena likhitam patram, pitur Ajn"A na lopitA !*

  

(which can also be construed as

*natena likhitam patram, pitur Ajn"A na lopitA !).*  

*  
*

Examples can be multiplied.

  

Handling the complex cases of *sabhan'ga-s'les"a* and *abhan'ga-s'les"a , (*and *s'abda-s'akti-mUla-dhvani)*are, of course, a far cry !
