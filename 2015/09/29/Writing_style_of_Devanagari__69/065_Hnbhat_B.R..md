Thank you for your appreciation. I will try to clear your doubts raised to the extend I could understand.

Rightly observed.

When the effect of phonetic conjunction is invariable (नित्य) , in all scripts may it be Devanagari or Roman or Telugu or Tamil or any other scripts such as Granthi or Sarada, is it written alike are differently in spite of the deficiency of representing all characters as in case of Tamil (where such sounds are substituted by the available sounds in that script)?  
\>  

The Grantha Script is devised to represent all the Sanskrit characters, supplementing Tamil alphabet, with new Malayalam like characters, which use all the characters in Sanskrit and in addition to those specific for Malayalam. Hence it is oftern Grantha-Tamil or Malayalam-Grantha or Sometimes called Tulu (in South Kanara where the spoken language is Tulu which is not seen in writing much literature except few by Sanskrit Scholars of late 19th century) script or Tigalari (in Noth Karnataka). The Nevari script on the other hand has five different varieties of
writing Nevari Script which present individuality of each script. Sharada uses almost the same letters as Devanagari, with slight variation and some entirely different letters. It is called also Kashmiri script sometimes. So each alphabet has individual characterestics which may or may not change in conjunction of letters. There is one more Nandi Nagari script which is used in Karnataka and Tamilnadu, the conjunct letters hard to differenciate the consonts in conjunct from their shape. I could not understand your question completely to give a precise reply as expected by you.

\> सञ्छिव: or सञ्च्छिव: or सञ्शिव:  
\> Do we use all these options? When we use only a few forms as per our convenience don't all the rest of the possible optionals disappear from the vision of the normal users who couldn't have any chance to specialize in Sanskrit Vyakarana Sastra?  
  
  

This is a question which has to be replied by the scholars and present day Sanskrit users alike. I also add to this question to be specific. If we use only convent forms splitting each word, as रामः वनम् गच्छति or even रामो वनं गच्छति, the other optional रामो वनङ्गच्छति is lost for ever. In manuscripts they opt the convenient form in Telugu, or Kannada, the anusvara is preferred to परसवर्ण, even in पञ्च, गङ्गा also whereas in Grantha manuscripts, the परसवर्ण is preferred due to the convenience of conjunct letters with ञ् and ङ्. Normally the copyists are not scholars and they copy from the proto-type without adding or losing anything into the same script or another script. The scholars who use the text for learning, often correct the scribal errors if they are experts. But do not change the optional forms therein as they could read anyway. The same with all the manuscripts, levaing no space or punctuation marks. Reading text itself will make them to understand the words and sentences or verses as the case be, even without space or punctuation. The optional forms are to be learnt today separately from the grammar texts, if one wants. There is a similar discussion, why I should learn व्याकरण in another group, which consisted mostly the learners. Majority preferred not to learn व्याकरण and in this case also, many would prefer not use the optional forms.

  
  
  
  
Can this kind of instances stand as examples for historical survival?  
  
  

It is already seen in Grammar texts now itself. We cannot go back to 3rd century or 1500 century back to revive writing.  
  
I am not replying the next questions as scholars may have different opinions.

  
  
  
"3. In the manuscripts of past centuries, if proper punctuation rules were not followed while writing, was it scribes' inefficiency (may be of one generation or of a series of generations) or the very language's recommendation?"  
  

Never. As I have said, the scribe need not be a scholar always and the scholars who use those manuscripts for learning, did not find the necessity of punctuation at all as an inflectional language, all the words are self explanatory.  
  
  
The understanding retains खलेकपोतन्याय, and where the आकाङ्क्षा ends, the sentence also ends, निराकाङ्क्षं वाक्यम् There are several definitions of वाक्य, as एकतिङ् वाक्यम्, etc. आकाङ्क्षा, योग्यता, मंनिधिः are the three factors generating शाब्दबोध.

  

  

The expression दशरामशराः would appear stange on hearing, than दश रामशराः with or without space. There is no effect of संहिता, only leaving space for words.

  

This is what I have to offer. Other scholars may have different opinions.
