I can write instead of

  

रामोवनङ्गच्छति which reflects परः संन्निकर्षः संहिता।  

  

but

  

रामो वनं गच्छति which is commonly written even with सन्धि, only your objection of keeping space between रामो वनं गच्छति in spite of Sandhi form in tact. In manuscripts we do not find any wordspace and we have to split the words only by reading the text with grammatical knowledge for the words in a sentence and even you cannot find any \| for full stop. We are presenting the text in the above way. Prof. Korada's opinion would be in favor of writing without space to reflect the परः सन्निकर्षः in संहिता। Even though space does not constitute part of the Sandhi, but way of writing for facilitating reading. वनङ्गच्छति may present problem for pronunciation for some readers who are not accustomed to see such forms, of parasavarna, And the resultant attempt to use uniformly anusvaara, which here is grammatically acceptable optionally in the above case, वनं गच्छति, वनङ्गच्छति, only the space differentiating. But वनं गच्छति is preferable for pronunciation and recognizing the two words immediately. The same applied by modern writers, गंगा prefered to the grammatically acceptable form गङ्गा by those people finding difficult to
pronunce ङ्ग. This leads the way off Panini's Sandhi rules. The space itself is against परःसंन्निकर्षः in संहिता.

  

As per वाक्ये तु सा विवक्षामपेक्षते, the संहिता itself optional, except in समास, धातूपसर्ग, and single word like गङ्गा where there is no option.

  

The option is रामः, वनम् गच्छति as three separate words all declined and placed with space uniformly after the individual word. But this does not facilitate in fluent reading of the three words when speak, unlike the English sentence with English words, where the सन्धि doesn't play much important role and roman script is convenient for writing with word space for each word in a sentence.

  

Panini does not allow word space in the case of संहिता as explained in परः संनिकर्षः and if Sandhi rules are applied, it word space between the words in संहिता form is against Panini. But even in संहितापाठ words are separated in printing Vedic texts and पदपाठ has the words split. Prof. Korada will explain the use of word space in संहिता text as we are used to see in the print.

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

And the last option
