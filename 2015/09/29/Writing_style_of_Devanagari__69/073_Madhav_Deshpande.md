Dear Marcis,

  

  It looks like writing continuous texts without gaps was the norm for the early form of writing Sanskrit and Prakrit, as it was for the ancient Greek. Leaving gaps between words probably developed as an aid to facilitate reading. I have attached an article of K.R. Norman on Ashokan rock edicts that shows how continuously written segments, without gaps, have been interpreted variously. Best,
