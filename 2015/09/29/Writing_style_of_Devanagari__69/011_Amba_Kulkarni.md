This claim that Sanskrit is suitable for computers appear time and again. It is a general misunderstanding that it is Sanskrit language which is suitable for computers. So I thought let me clarify a few points in this connection.  
  
The connection goes back to a paper published by Rick Briggs in a professional computer magazine 30 years ago (Knowledge Representation in Sanskrit and Artificial Intelligence, in AI Magazine, issue 6, 1985). This article precisely talks about the  
**shaabdabodha tradition** in India which has similarities to the notion of semantic net. However, it should also be noted that no clear follow-up to this article emerged in the last 30 years from the author.  

  

With regards,
