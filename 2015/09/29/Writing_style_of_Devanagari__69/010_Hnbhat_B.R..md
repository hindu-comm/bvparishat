\> Yes, it is definitely a दोष. But as explained by Nori, it has a purpose when written especially in roman script. The purpose is to make it easy to read and understand. Since now the word boundaries are indicated, one can understand the text easily. At the same time, since the var.nas that have undergone change are retained without going back to the unsandhied version, the original sa.mhitaa text is also available.

The question is which one is correct or is there any rule to decide which one are to be used?

  

Panini formed his rules neither for Devanagari nor roman script or IAST or any particular script, which have their own way of writing. The 20th century way of writing, may not be suitable for computational processing today which Panini probably didn't consider, though it is claimed Sanskrit Language is suitable for computers.

Those who could not find it easy to read the conventional writing, invent new methods of writing and if you ask is there any rule which is to be chosen amonth the ones listed, Panini's Sandhi rules may not help as I know he did not form any rule for how to write in Devanagari or in any script.
