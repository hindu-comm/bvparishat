This is the opinion of विश्वनाथन्यायपञ्चानन - on the understanding of a sentence:

  

परंतु तावत्पदार्थानां स्मरणादेकदैव खले कपोतन्यायात् तावत्पदार्थानां क्रियाकर्मभावेनाऽन्वयबोधरूप: शाब्दबोधो भवतीति केचित्। ""वृद्धा युवान: शिशव: कपोता: खले यथाऽमी युगपत् पतन्ति। तथैव सर्वे युगपत् पदार्था: परस्परेणाऽन्वयिनो भवन्ति ...  

  

अपरे तु-

""यद्यदाकाङ्क्षितं योग्यं सन्निधानं प्रपद्यते।

तेन तेनोऽन्वित: स्वार्थ: पदैरेवाऽगम्यते।।""

तथा च खण्डवाक्यार्थबोधानन्तरं तथैव पदार्थस्मृत्या महावाक्यार्थबोध इत्यप्याहु:।

  

Since Ambal asked for शाब्दबोध in another thread, I quoted here.

  

Even what we follow today, पदच्छेदः, पदार्थोक्तिः, विग्रहः, वाक्ययोजना in order to get the meaning, by reading the verse itself or any sentence, a experienced reader would get the meaning, without pausing for Sandhi Viccheda, while reading the verse. Only the pause if any would be to get the word meaning, one has not heard, but the meaning is decided by the कर्मक्रियाभाव as one reads. कर्मपदस्य क्रियापेक्षा, क्रियापदस्य कर्त्रपेक्षा, the relation ship when the requirements are filled to complete a sentence, the meaning is automatically appear in the mind of the reader while finishing the reading the verse. This what I get from the above.

  

The same with reading manuscripts, where there is no space to separate words, and if any, some dot, or some mark to notify a sentence completed or verse with numbers. The same with Nirnayasagar Pothy printings, or पत्राकार books, but they also include some mark to notify a दण्ड mark to show the end of a sentence or verses numbered mostly. But there may be even without numbers verses printed.
