It seems that both Dr. Rani S. Murthy and Shri H. N. Bhatt hit the nail on the head by focussing on the part played by the scribes. And I may add that the engravers or etchers of the inscriptions also must have influenced the writing style or rather non-style.

1\. As it was pointed by Shri Bhatt, most of the time the written manuscripts were used as reference books only in those days rather than as text books. The scholar already knew or at least had studied the book, and was keeping a written copy only for the sake of reference or some other purpose. So he was not confused by the punctuation or lack of punctuation. He knew his text.

2\. Writing in the early days was mostly confined to inscriptions on rock or copper. Such a writing might have had its restrictions on the size of the copper plate or the rock area. So punctuation might been given secondary importance in the face of such constraints. (Writing on palm leaves also might have put some constraints of space on the scribe forcing them to adopt a chain like writing style.)

3\. When printing was first introduced and the Sanskrit texts were printed, the early letter press composers followed the manuscript or inscription style. But later proper spacing technique has evolved to make the text more readable. The avagraha or double avagraha being used to denote a savrna dirgha sandhi that has a long a at the beginning of the second word or at the end of the first word as in माङ्गल्यदाऽस्तु / माङ्गल्यदाऽऽसीत् is such a new notation to make the text unambiguous.

So we can conclude that writing styles may change with time. (Nowadays the printing styles and writing styles differ sometime. But that may be another topic) And though any punctuation marks were not specifically mentioned, the concept of punctuation surely did exist in the earlier days.
