I notice that there is a kaaraka relation between the padas involved.

I do not see any special *kAraka*-sensitivity in the original cited. *Prayoga*-texts abound in series of actions in each module. Typically, the modules are long, single, sentences containing numerous sentoids marking the sequence of actions through participles, reserving the finite verbal formto the end. Such action-packed manuals, as in lab manuals of physics, say, have hardly much to do with descriptive epithets. And hence, they look like *kAraka*-*kriyA* sets piled up.

  

Beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder : A computational linguist is entitled to feel quite licit a horripilation upon seeing serial strings conforming to a profusion of Semantic Nets or *karaka*-*cakra*-s.
