Of the examples you have cited,

  

the first set is strictly following sandhi rules, देवताःस्मरन् and देवतास्स्मरन् are only optional forms in Sandhi, due to 8-3-36 वा शरि which says that the replacement स् to visarga occurs optionally as शर् (श ष स). It is not mixture of sandhi or visandhi/.

  

In the second set, of the two forms you have quoted, the first is only correct: आसनउपविश्य with Sandhi form only and the other आसनोपविश्य is simply not possible by sandhi of the other. The visandhi form would be आसने उपविश्य. Only space they have not given between the words.
