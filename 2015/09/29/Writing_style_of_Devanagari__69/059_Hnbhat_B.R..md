mātṛśulkād upagatāṃ te śriyaṃ na viṣehire /

rarakṣuś ca pituḥ kautsās te bhavanti sma gautamāḥ // Saund_1.22 //

  

The above is usual way of writing in Roman script. The above is a verse in Saundarananda in Roman schript encoded in IAST roman script encoded by a westerner.  
The same verse converted into Devanagari raises the question, as Usha had asked:

  

*1. मातृशुल्काद् उपगतां* ते श्रियं न विषेहिरे /

*ररक्षुश् च* पितुः *कौत्सास् ते* भवन्ति स्म गौतमाः //

  

Is at acceptable in Devanagari writing in comparison to the present practice of writing we of older generation are used to as:

  

*मातृशुल्कादुपगतां*ते श्रियं न विषेहिरे /

*ररक्षुश्च*पितुः*कौत्सास्ते*भवन्ति स्म गौतमाः //

  

or more recent one practice of writing:

  

*मातृशुल्काद्* *उपगताम् ते श्रियम्* न विषेहिरे /

*ररक्षुः च पितुः कौत्साः ते* भवन्ति स्म गौतमाः //

  

particularly in Devanagari, and/or any other Indian language;

In Tamil script there is no combined conjunct letter and there may be some other scripts, which do not use comjunct letters. The question relates specifically to Devanagari writing following the style followed in Roman IAST. (Simple roman script do not find place in preparing e-texts by scholars).

கதாம் தே  ச்ரியம் ந ஁in Tamil, it writes only the conjunct letters are written as ablove only split.

  

దుపగతాం తే శ్రియం న in Telugu as in Devanagari we use.  

  

  

It has extended, the विसन्धि and संहिता as the normal way of संहिता and श्लोक-s excepting श्लोकार्ध.
