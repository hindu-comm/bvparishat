Yes, it is definitely a दोष. But as explained by Nori, it has a purpose when written especially in roman script. The purpose is to make it easy to read and understand. Since now the word boundaries are indicated, one can understand the text easily. At the same time, since the var.nas that have undergone change are retained without going back to the unsandhied version, the original sa.mhitaa text is also available.  
  

In Devanagari also at certain places we retain sandhi, and still add a space as in वनं गच्छति, तथो हि, etc. This makes processing Devanagari text difficult than processing romanised one. In Romanised text, uniformally all the sandhis are retained while in Devanagari some sandhis are resolved and some sandhis are retained.
