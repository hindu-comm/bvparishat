The issue of *samhitA*, it was my intention to point out, owes its genesis to its sacerdotal archetype. Despite the controversy as to whether the word *pada*-*prakRtiH* (in the *prAtis*'*Akhya* text I cited) was to be construed as *tatpurus*"*a* or *bahuvrIhi*, it is evident that the pada-split was already considered *paurus*"*eya*, (*pada-kArar nAma laks"aNam anuvartyam*) which may imply a certain freedom in presentation with due regard to ease of comprehension.  
  
And in our own times, even as fastidious a scholar as Charudeva Sastri, who had a high admiration for VAmana's dictum, did not present his compositions in all-sandhied Sanskrit, though he too insisted on the primacy of the *samhitA*-made presentation. The special case of "*na samhitAm vivaks"Ami*" - was of course discussed even as early as the times of Dandin.  
  

This gives a handle, then, to take some amount of freedom in our worldly (*paurus"eya*) transactions in Sanskrit. It is true too, that most Sanskrit writers today - as Prof Amba Kulkarni rightly points out - (and not excluding the writers of Samskrita Bharati) are not thoroughly consistent in printing passages in a non-sandhied form throughout.  
  

This being the case, certain adaptations for computational purposes, and our own comprehensional purposes too, need not be, in my humble opinion, strongly objected to.
