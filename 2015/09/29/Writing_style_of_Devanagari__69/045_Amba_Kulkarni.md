Thank you Prof. Deshpande.  
  

This piece is very interesting. While I find देवताःस्मरन् written together without any gap in between, but in unsandhied form as against देवतास्स्मरन्, आसनउपविश्य as against आसनोपविश्य, I notice that there is a kaaraka relation between the padas involved.  
  

And this has been uniformally followed. Typically all the kaarakas of a verb in k.rdanta form are kept together.  
  

संस्कारेषुकरिष्यमाणेषु  
आसनउपविश्य  
आचम्य  
पवित्रपाणिःप्राणानायम्य  
यथाचारभिष्टदेवतागुर्वादीन्नत्वा  
ब्राह्मणाननुज्ञाप्य  
सुमुखश्चेत्यादिनानापद्यपाठपूर्वकं  
देवताःस्मरन्  
देशकालौसंकीर्त्य  
  

Thank you very much once again for sharing this.  
  

With kind regards,  

Amba
