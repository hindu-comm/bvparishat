I have edited one rare manuscript,named, Shataprashnottaree शतप्रश्नोत्तरी, written or composed by one Ayodhyaprasada.अयोध्याप्रसाद.This Ms.is in the collection of the Oriental Institute,Baroda.It was published by the O.I. as No.23 in the M.S.Universiy Oriental Series in 2008 and is priced at only Rs.55/-.

  

It is a collection of one hundred questions put by the inquisitive shishya(शिष्य) and the answers given by his spiritually equipped teacher(गुरु). In the span of only one hundred questions,almost all the basic and important concepts of Vedanta have been clearly defined and explained in a very lucid and flowing Sanskrit-both gadya as well as padya. The date of composition of this small work is Shaka 1699,Vikram Samvat 1835,corresponding to 1777-78 A.D.

It seems to be the first attempt-that has tillnow come to light- to condense successfully all the Principles of Vedanta,along with other Concepts of Yoga etc.

  

It may be interesting to compare these two works.
