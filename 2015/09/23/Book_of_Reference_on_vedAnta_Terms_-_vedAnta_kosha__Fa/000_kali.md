HariH OM!

  

sarvebhyo namaskāraḥ,

  
I was looking for a reference book on Vedānta terms

when my friend informed me about a book written by

Shri Mahādānapuram Sītārāma Gautamaḥ s/o Shri

Viśwanātha Āryā. In the course of my search in online

forums I came across a message in Advaitin-1 where

mention on the Vedānta Kośaḥ was found with the

address as follows:

  

  
 B-4, Jubilee Apartments, 48, Jubilee Road, West

Mambalam, Chennai 600 033.

  

  
I was quite skeptical about finding the person in the

same address since the Advaitin message was 9 years

old. However, to my surprise I found his wife and

daughter in the same address although Shri Sītārāma

Gautamaḥ has reached Paramapadam about 15 years ago. My

surprise was all the more greater when they told me

that a few more copies are still available with them.

I immediately grabbed couple of them. I am told that

some more copies are still with them. I Understand

that only recently some lady from Powai Chimayananda

Ashram had bought some 100 copies and only very few

are left with them.

  

  
The purpose of my note here is that any genuinely

interested student of Vedānta ought to possess this

Kośaḥ which is in simple Sanskrit, appealing to both

scholars and neophytes equally. Since only few copies

of the original edition are left out, my suggestion is

to kindly make a beeline for purchasing the book asap.

  

  
Their Address:

  

  
Shrimati Uma Viswanathan, d/o Shri. M.V. Sitaraman,

B-4, Jubilee Apartments, 48, Jubilee Road, West

Mambalam, Chennai 600 033.

  

  
Res: (044) 2474 8480 Mob: 98842 48392

  

  
Alternatively, I am also willing to be of assistance

since I reside close by.

  

  
My contact: Mob : 99520 52153.
