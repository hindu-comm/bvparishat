नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

  

I have heard that there is a limb mapping to the varna which eventually is  

ritualized as nyAsa. Can you kindly guide me to the original literature on  

the subject?

Please look into the snapshots - if this is what you are looking for then I shall give the names and other details of the books .

  

This is वैखरी - discussed after मध्यमा - in most of the books on तन्त्रम् this pattern is followed.

  

There is plenty of literature on this subject.

  

Sorry , I have not organized the snapshots well .

  

धन्यो’स्मि
