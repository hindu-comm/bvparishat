Shanakra says Sankhya is Pradhana Malla. During his times several views were prevalent that Sankhya Vadins represented the view of the upanishads he wanted to show the views of the Sankhya Vadins was not what the Upanishads wanted to convey Many systems including Purva Mimamsa Nyaya, Vedanta Yoga Buddhist theories are criticized by Shankara. Mimasikas advocates adherence to rituals which is the purpose of Karma Kanda and all Vedic utterances. Shankara was opposed to the interpretation given by Mimamsikas on uttara Miamsa Sutras and not on Purva Mimasa. He was ready to accommodate many views of purva Mimasa but was opposed to most of the views of Sankhya including its siddhanta.
