Maanyvar

The point is summarised in MahA VAkya.... one can enumerate it to five or thre or as one finds convenient to satisfy himself.

But the One only is enough:

tat tvam asi.

Now let the philologists struggle on each of the three shabd.

  

The pointing is from one facet of the same "tat" to the other within such that the syzygy begins exploration in a self propelling way. the same facet come when we talk of the word "sAmkhya" where Prakriti and Purusha are two only apparentlt when tried to comprehend by the mind which simply fails in the state of nondiscrimination.

Any difference is only apparent from secondary stage.

Regards

Sati Shankar
