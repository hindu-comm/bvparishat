is this you interpretation? " "sAmkhya" where Prakriti and Purusha are two only apparentlt when tried to comprehend by the mind which simply fails in the state of nondiscrimination. Any difference is only apparent from secondary stage."  
  
Can you please give me any one traditional text which supports such a view? if there are no texts that can back this claim ca

n

I say its your own theory?
