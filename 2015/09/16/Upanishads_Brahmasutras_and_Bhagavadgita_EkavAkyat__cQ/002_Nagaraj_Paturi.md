AadaraNIya Siva Senaniji placed it all in the rightperspective.



May I attempt it in another fashion?



1\. The concepts characteristically focussed on by Upanshads such as 'Brahman', 'mOksha', 'Atman' etc. are not focussed on by any other book than Brahma sutras.



2\. There is no statement in any sUtra which expresses the difference of opinion of the sUtrakAra with any of the portions of the Upanishads.



3\. Bhagavadgita too takes up the same group of concepts such as 'Brahman', 'mOksha', 'Atman' etc. for its central focus.



4\. There is no statement in Bhagavadgita expressing difference of opinion with either Upanishads or Brahmasutras.



5\. Moreover, in Brahmasutras and Bhagavadgita, there are several instances of (i) paraphrasings/rewordings of(ii) references to the statements in Upanishads.
