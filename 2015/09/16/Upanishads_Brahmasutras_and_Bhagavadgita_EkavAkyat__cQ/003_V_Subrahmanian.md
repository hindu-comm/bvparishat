In fact the word 'brahmasūtra-padaiścaiva' of the BG 13th ch. has been commented upon by non-Advaitic Acharyas as referring to the Bādarāyana Brahmasūtras. There are many similar expressions in the BG that can be sourced from the Upanishad, especially the Kaṭhopaniṣat: na jāyate mṛiyate..., āścaryavat paśyati...indriyāni parāṇyāhuḥ, etc. are glaring instances of such similarity which a present-day popular Acharya said 'the BG has 'lifted' these ideas/words from the K.up.' humorously.
