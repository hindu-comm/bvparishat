The Advaita as proposed by Shankara is not based on Sankhya its based on Upanishads Gita an Brahma Sutras. For Shankara, Sankhya was a Pradhana Malla or an important opponent. He wrote his system of thought to remove the misconception that the Sankhya Vadins were saying as per his system of thought.
