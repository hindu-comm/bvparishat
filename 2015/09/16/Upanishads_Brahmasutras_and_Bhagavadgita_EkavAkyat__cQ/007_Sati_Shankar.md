Sir,

How can I add some thing from my own, especially when scriptures are concerned? I have been working on it for quite some time and with mathematical precision, where each and every statement shall be supported by an Authority, and it should come very soon( possibly by mid of 2016) in the form of a monograph at least.

Please bear with me for the time being.

Regards

Sati Shankar
