**Bhagavadgita is full of Saamkhya terminology, and at one place even refers to Vedanta as Saamkhya (18.13) but even a basic study will show that the position of Bhagavadgita is fundamentally different from that of Saamkhya, as known to us today.**

**In Samkhya of Kapila, the scope of its theoretical teaching is upto the level of the 25th tattva, i.e. the purusha and that is why the Samkhya of Kapila ends up with plurality of purushas, when they are freed from the Prakrti. Lord Krishna brackets the Samkhya and Yoga together and in the latter there is the 26th tattva, which is Ishvara, who is unaffected by Prakrti and who helps the purushas to escape the clutch of Prakrti. At the final stage the purushas merge with the Ishvara and there is no plurality of the purushas.

**If I am permitted to cite an example of different levels of teaching, I will like to cite the following: In the late fifties to early sixties (late 1950s - early 1960s) a degree level science student learnt only upto the electronic structure of the atom. It was only at the postgraduate level at that time, the students had the glimpse of the subatomic structure with several sub-atomic particles as well as of the role of the molecular orbital theory etc.

**Thus, there is nothing wrong with Kapila's Samkhya, if we don't forget that that the highest level of teaching of Samkhya is only at the Vedantic level.
