Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya  
  
Dear Aurobindji,  
  
I think no correction is needed.  
Please see the following verse from Sankhyakarika :  
  

प्रकृतेः सुकुमारतरं न किञ्चिदस्तीति मे मतिर्भवति ।

या दृष्टास्मीति पुनर्न दर्शनमुपैति पुरुषस्य ॥ ६१ ॥  

As regards Bhagavad Gita, one of the prashtanatrayas, it has the Vedantic approach, which is higher than that of Sankhya of Kapila. Adi Shankara was a great person but it must be admitted that Lord Krishna gave the exposition of the Vedantic Sankhya, more than 2,600 years before Adi Shankara's birth.
