I am not a sankhya specialist. What are saying I cannot follow. I have nothing to loose or gain. The position of Sankhya is well know and what you said about Sankhya is obviously in correct. Its for you to revise your knowledge as I do so every day. I am as much a learner as you are. You said you know what you are saying but when I asked for scriptural source you said you are out of academics. I don't own this group its a factually in correct statement. When I write, I write like you or any other member. This group belongs to members. If you have clarification don't you ask scholars I do the same  

Please take your time to respond I am in no hurry
