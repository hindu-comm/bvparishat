In fact , I am bit reserved in using the terminology of opponents. Even though the usage of poorvapaksham in literal sense may mean it, all other systems of philosophy are supportive and distinguished by the Adhikari bedha.  
What Sankara vehemently opposed was only the poorva mimamsa and it's blind adherence to rituals. He in his commentaries has shown that other stages of Bhakti, Yoga etc are not opposed to knowledge but can be used for Chittasudhi. But the rituals having bestowed the doership leads the doer to believe in his doership. While all thru he is not, in reality.  
Hari Om,  
Aurobind Padiyath
