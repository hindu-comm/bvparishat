Thank you very much to you all, for enlightening in puts, I could not disagree with any one as what has been said is according to the traditional scriptural sources we have inherited.Thanks again.

Special thanks to Dr. Bijoy Misra for supporting my request in my second input to this thread... requesting for some time to let me finish my writing and bear with for the time being. Regards to you all.

Sati Shankar
