Sure but still the siddhanta of Sankhya is dualism which is not acceptable to Shankara advaita vedanta. Probably what you meant is Sankhya of Isvara Krishna or Pre Isvara Krishna Sankhya. Sankhya Karikas is said to written by Isvara Krishna and not by Kapila. For Shankara, Isvara Krihna and all Sankhya vadains were his opponents. We still do not know for sure if Shankar was referring to Karikas of Isvara Krishna but he definitely knew the Sankhya as proposed in the Karikas. Sankhya Sutras ascribed to Kapila is a late text might not have been in existence when Shankara wrote his Bhashyas.  
  

I agree Shankara never said he is formulating a new theory but is only amplifying and expanding the views of Prasthana Trayi and there is no doubt.
