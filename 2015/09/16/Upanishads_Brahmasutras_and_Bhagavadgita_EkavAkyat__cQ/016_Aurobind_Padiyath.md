Dear Sunilji,  
Slight correction, as per my understanding, is that the early Samkhya system had many 'purusha' enticed by prakrti goes thru the cycle of death and birth. And moksha in their terms is when the 'purusha' stops identifying with the prakrti knowing it's own nature and gets moksha. The prakrti going into hiding etc are dramatic explanations. But in the Bhagavad Gita the term "Uttamhpurusha" is introduced to bring in the Ishwara (Samkhya do not recognise the Ishwara ), who is also called the Purushotamah. To drivein this, the later expounded format of many purusha,called the Jivas, and the Uttamhpurusha as the "Parameshwarah" or ParamaAtma. The current Advaita is based on the early Samkhya system but improvised by Adi Sankara invoking the similarities of it seen, as to the presence of ParamAtma, in Upanishads, Bhagavad Gita, and Brahma sutras as prasthanatraya.

Hari Om!
