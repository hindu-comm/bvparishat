Dear Ajitji,  
I suppose that you replied in a hurry. Not having read my words "early Samkhya" which meant the Samkhya Karika of Kapila. There are many exponents later. But if you go thru the three pillars on which Bhashya was written and study in dept, one can see that Sankara built his philosophy where Kapila stopped and used the words of the Prasthanathrayi as authority and never claimed that his words are his personal but they are words of Shastras.  
Hari Om,  
Aurobind Padiyath.
