Dear Ajitji,  
  

In Samkhya of Kapila the Purusha and the Prakrti are different and when the Purusha comes to know (sees) the Prakrti, the Prakrti hides like a shy maiden and the Purusha gets freed from Prakrti. However in Vedanta the the individual Purusha is higher Prakrti and with Vedantic knowledge the purusha merges with Brahman.
