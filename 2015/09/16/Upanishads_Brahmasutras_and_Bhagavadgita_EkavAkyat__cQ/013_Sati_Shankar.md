Manyavar

What I say I mean. When I said that I am working on it and with "Mathematical Precision" where each statement made is backed by atleast one authority or scripture citation, I know what I am saying.

There should not be a prestige issue because whatever will be said has already in scriptures.....

Let me finish my writing as said earlier and allow for some time.

  

So far as leaving the Grouup is concerned, I do not submit to this trend as many wish like that on this or that reason when find something to disagree. It is your group why will you leave.....
