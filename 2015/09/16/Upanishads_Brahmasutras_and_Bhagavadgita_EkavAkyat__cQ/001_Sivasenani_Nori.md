The relation between the three is that of a) base text, b) criticism, and c) case study. The Upanishads (Veda) are the basic texts which teach the central tenet of the system (whatever be it interpreted as). The aim of the basic texts is uddharana of the saadhaka, not argumentation or reasoning (Sraddha is taken as a given). A critical examination of this teaching is found in the Nyaayaprasthaanam, Brahmasutras. Here apparently different teachings are reconciled to be teaching the same noumenon through different means, different opinions are discussed and shown to be untenable etc. Finally, all this teaching ought to find application in real life. That application, practical Vedanta, is found in Bhagavadgita.

  

Yes, at the superficial level there will be differences, but in reality they are not differences in the underlying message. For instance, Bhagavadgita is full of Saamkhya terminology, and at one place even refers to Vedanta as Saamkhya (18.13) but even a basic study will show that the position of Bhagavadgita is fundamentally different from that of Saamkhya, as known to us today. They are clubbed together because each complements the other two. Ekavaakyataa of the Vedas is shown in the Brahmasutras (तत्तु समन्वयात्) and the same Truth taught seemingly variously by Veda and reconciled by Brahmasutras, is again applied to bear upon a given situation, by different analyses (whether you take Karma maarga, Bhakti maarga or Jnaana maarga, the conclusion is same: Fight, do your duty, your natural Karma) in the Bhagavadgita. Analysis and synthesis of the same Truth is found in the three texts.
