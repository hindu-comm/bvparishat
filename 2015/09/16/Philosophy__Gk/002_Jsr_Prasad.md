Sir,  
  

It is a good effort indeed and the content is true to its title. Discussion on darshanas to Vedanta gives the gist in a nutshell. May I humbly submit a few quick comments.  
  

\- you may also include that 'science' is its roots in philosophical enquiry in Indian context. A sentence or two may be enough. So, that strengthens the position of philosophy.  
  

\- the five elements of philosophy studies that you explained are peripheral to the central question - 'who am I'? The fourfold classification of cognition - प्रमाता, प्रमाणं, प्रमेयं, प्रमितिः helps to understand the central question.  
  
- \<*All the systems emerged from 1000 BC onwards over a period of thousand years or so.*\> This comment can be controversial as per Hindu *kAlamAna*.  
  

\- number of pramanas mentioned is fine. But we cannot limit the number to six as the list can grow up to twelve, though on majority level, Pratyaks ha, Anumana and Agama are accepted.  
  

\- As much as I see, the Vaiseshika system do not use word 'Brahma' as the creator of all matter than 'Isvara.' So, conventionally, the term Isvara is more popular than Brahman in darshanas, unlike in Uttara MeemAmsA.  
  
- \<*Yoga which is generally clubbed with Sankhya believes in training the body and the mind to attain Moksha.*\> May I put that the prime goal of Yoga is to train the mind through training the body. Because one trains the body through Hathayoga techniques. It has no role when the sadhaka is reaching the pinnacle of practice.  
  
- \<*Istha Devata(chosen deity)*\> have you considered 'Isvara' to be Ishta devata, based on ईश्वरप्रणिधानाद्वा?  
  
- \<*You can call Advaita Non-theistic.*\> I could not follow this.  
  
- \<*Religion is a question of faith with a belief in a supreme power whereas Philosophy is the study of existence based on reason and analysis. Both address the same issues with different outcomes.>* Religion is a coined word that is influenced by the western philosophers. Philosophy can be a near term to 'darshanam.' In that sense, darshanam encompasses everything.  
  
- \< *In our tradition, both ritualism and philosophy have evolved from the same sources, namely, Vedas.*\> Are you trying to say about the two branches of Upanishads - Karmakanda and Jnanakanda?  

  

Regards,  

Prasad
