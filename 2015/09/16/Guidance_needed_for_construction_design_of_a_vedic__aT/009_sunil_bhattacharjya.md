Sringeri has the holy river Tunga river nearby \[Ganga snaanam, Tunga paanam (& Narmada darshanam)\]. I did not see any river or water-tank nearby the Pathshala in the Video sent by Prof. Nagarajj. Hope it has not escaped my attention. May be a water tank on the Eastern side of the proposed Veda Pathshala campus will be advisable, unless that is in a water-scarcity area. I guess that is a Vastu recommendation too.
