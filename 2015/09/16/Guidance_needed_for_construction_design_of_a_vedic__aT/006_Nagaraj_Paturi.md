Engineers and architects give you plans as per your requirement. When Vidwan Damodara Dasa is going to consult an engineer or architect, he is going to ask him parameters within which he has to give his plan or design. Vidwan Damodara Dasa is probably looking for inspirations to himself before he gives his requirements to his engineers and architects.



Google does not tell you the specific data unless you ask it specifically.

I could reach the specific pictures and videos because I knew the place and I knew to pinpoint through right keywords on the basis of my previous knowledge.



I thought a picture or video is worth several words.



There are descriptions of gurukulas in Itihasas, Puranas and Kavyas too which can boost the imagination of the clients approaching the engineers and architects.



Pointers to them could also be helpful.



I shall share references to those too.
