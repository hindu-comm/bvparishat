Hare Krishna.  
  
Dear vidvajjanas,  
we are in a process to construct a new building for our small gurukula  
running on the ancient principles. This gurukula has 22 students  
currently. we do not use electricity, gas, etc. modern amenities.  
Basically it is a village type of setup. Now as the no. of children  
are increasing we have decided to build a new building that can  
accommodate about 100 children (of all age group from 6 to 16). But we  
lack information about building design, landscaping, etc for a  
traditional type of gurukula building.  
  
Any help in this regard will be appreciated. My expectation is that  
you can guide me either to the references from literatures where such  
information is available, or some research already done by some  
scholars in this matter, or persons knowledgeable in this matter.  
  
Thankyou,  
Damodara Das
