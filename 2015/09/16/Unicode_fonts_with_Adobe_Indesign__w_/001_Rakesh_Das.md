Adobe does not support unicode.

  

There are some alternatives.

1\. The best way is using latex (miktex if you use windows). It is easy.

You may type the matter in word (ms-word or open office or libre office provides word). Then the settings can be done in latex. Even some word to latex conversion is available.

2\. The second way is using ms-publisher. It is somehow similar to pagemaker or indesign. But not used commercially. I have not seen people using publisher for dtp (usually books, thesis etc.)

3\. If you use linux platform there is a software scribus. Not very popular.

  

Personally I use, prefer and suggest latex for any kind of publication. In fact I have designed my ph.d. thesis and at least 15 books in latex. Personally I can assist you if necessary.

  

I attach a file designed in latex. It is in book form. The font used is Sanskrit 2003 (unicode). It is a bi-yearly literary magazine. Since, I am the sub-editor I use latex for setting the magazine.
