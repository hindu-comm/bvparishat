Yes. Vidwan Narendra Dutt Tiwari educated at least me about this great software.



[This software](http://vsoftsolutions.in/site/aps-designer-5-0/) APS Designer 5.0 seems to be exactly suitable for the purpose.



Made for indic fonts.



Supports both Unicode and non-Unicode fonts.



But it is commercial. 



There areAPS Designer 6.0 , APS RUPANTAR, APS Saral - versions.



Best wishes,
