APS costs nearly ₹5000/-. So are Akruti etc. Indesign files are not supported without you install indesign. That again costs nearly ₹3000/- or something. Latex is free and portable. you can carry your file anywhere and can edit it on any machine without any extra software installed. The file size is also minimum as it is a text file. I think this thread may be finished here.
