I am contributing here whatever i have learnt about this subject matter:  
  
The term 'Śakaṭā' can be found in the Naḍādi-gaṇa and that is from where the term 'Śākaṭāyana' can be derived easily.  
  
The name 'Śākaṭāyana' occurs in the Nirukta (1.12) in regards to the difference of opinion between the grammarians and author(s) of Nirukta. The difference of opinion seems to be severe enough to be mentioned in the Nirukta and it was about whether all terms belonging to the category of 'nāma' had arisen from ākhyātas or not:  
  
***tatra nāmāni ākhyātajāni iti śākaṭāyanaḥ nairuktasamayaś ca***  
  
**Translation**: \[Among four categories of terms viz. nāma, ākhyāta, upasarga and nipāta\], all nāmas have arisen from ākhyātas. This is the opinion of Śākaṭāyana and the Nirukta author(s).  
  
The grammarians along with Gārgya had another opinion. This is given in the immediate next sentence in the same section of Nirukta:  
  
***na sarvāṇi iti gārgyaḥ vaiyākaraṇānāṁ ca eke  
  
*Translation**: Not all nāmas have arisen from ākhyātas — this is the opinion of Gārgya and the grammarians.  
  
Pāṇini mentions Śākaṭāyana in three places:  
  
(a) laṅaḥ śākaṭāyanasyaiva  
(b) vyorlaghuprayatnataraḥ śākaṭāyanasya (8.3.18)  
(c) triprabhṛtiṣu śākaṭāyanasya (8.4.50)  
  
Professor Deshpande has already given the reference from Mahābhāṣya (śakaṭasya tokam). In another section however, Patañjalī says that when Śākaṭāyana was once waiting for a cart (to travel), he was so engrossed in his thoughts that many carts passed by and he did not even notice:  
  
***vaiyākaraṇānāṁ śākaṭāyano rathamārga āsīnaḥ śakaṭasārthaṁ yāntaṁ nopalebhe*** (Mahābhāṣya on Pāṇini 3.2.115 - parokṣe liṭ)  
  
Opinion of Nyāsakāra in regards to Śākaṭāyana is given in the Nyāsa on 3.3.1:  
  
***tad evaṁ niruktakāra-śākaṭāyana-darśanena trayī śabdānāṁ pravṛttiḥ  
  
*Translation:** According to the *darśana* of Niruktakāra and Śākaṭāyana, śabda-pravṛtti is of three types (jāti, guṇa, kriyā).  
  
Nāgeśa bhaṭṭa in his Uddyota on Pradīpa on Mahābhāṣya 1.1.1 says that Ṛktantra and uṇādi were creations of Śākaṭāyana.  
  
There is a grammar by a later 'Śākaṭāyana' available (search google for "2990140052347") but he seems to be a Jaina Śākaṭāyana.  
  
sādhu-caraṇa-rajo 'bhilāṣī,  
  
hari pārṣada dāsa.
