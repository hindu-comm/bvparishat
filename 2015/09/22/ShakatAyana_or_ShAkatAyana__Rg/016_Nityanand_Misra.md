Thanks for the extract from Rajwade’s translation and comments. While his initial explanation is also ‘Gārgya says and some grammarians say’ (गार्ग्य म्हणतो व कांहीं वैयाकरण म्हणतात), his proposal for an alternative reading is interesting. I am not sure if Rajwade considered the possibility that before or during the time of Yāska, there were other grammarians in favour of Śākaṭāyana’s position but they were not as notable as Śākaṭāyana and Gārgya to be mentioned by him. While it is possible that Śākaṭāyana was the only grammarian on his side of the debate (as Rajwade postulates), there is no clinching evidence in favour of it, at least from the text of Nirukta.

  

As far as Rajwade’s proposed reading is concerned, on p. 23 of his critical edition (MLBD 1967 reprint), Lakshman Saroop mentions he had evidence of sixty-five manuscripts on Nirukta (thirty-seven of which were in his own possession). Saroop does not give any variant reading for the statement for which Rajwade proposes an alternative reading. With the new reading proposed by Rajwade, the interpretation that all grammarians except Śākaṭāyana were in favour of the second position is compatible. But this interpretation is problematic if we accept the reading as is, as you say. In the absence of a manuscript with an alternative reading (Rajwade does not mention any), स्थितस्य गतिश्चिन्तनीया may be followed.

  

Here are some academic sources in English which interpret *vaiyākaraṇānāṃ caike* as 'and some of the grammarians,' a faithful translation which does not require any assumption or alternate reading:

    Lang. ISBN 9780820454375. p. 41: *On the other hand, Gārgya and

    from verb-roots and that there were some underived nouns*.

    Volume 5. Motilal Banarsidass. ISBN 9788120804265. p. 108: *But
    Gārgya and some of the Grammarians held a more sober view that it is
    not possible to trace all nouns to verbal roots*.  

Malati Shengde says *Gārgya and others*

  

Malati J. Shendge (1997). The Language of the Harappans: From Akkadian to Sanskrit. Abhinav Publications. ISBN 9788170173250. p. 76: *Gārgya and others who were later than him ... Gārgya and others who did not agree with this ... between Śākaṭāyana, the founder of the science of etymology in the world, and Gārgya and others*?
