Did you find "ShakatAyana and ShAkatAyana two different historical persons?"

  

  

Many have taken one name शाकटायन referred to by Yaska in Nirukta and by Panini and Patanjali. Is the same name you wanted to get clarification? All have quoted the references and none have answered your question of identify except Prof. Korada, who took one as स्मृतिकार and the other as grammarian.

  

Did you refer to author of Smriti, referred to by Prof. Korada or the personnages mentioned in Nirukta and Panini, Patanjali etc. grammarians? In any case, the question of historical identify still needs to be invented. Are all the three are different or one and the same person. Hari Parshvada has given the etymology for the word शाकटायन and not for शकटायन as you have raised in your question in addition to references with translations.

  

The question has not yet been answered. Please the scholars may concentrate on the question by the questioner in their replies and not to fill in what they know all about/but for the point raised in the question which deviates the question according to the depth of the knowledge of the members replying.
