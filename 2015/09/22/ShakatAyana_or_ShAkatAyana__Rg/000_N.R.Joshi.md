Respected Scholars, Namakar!



Are ShakatAyana and ShAkatAyana two different historical persons or one person? If two, which one is associated with the opinion that all nouns comes from roots (DhAtus) in debate with GArgya? If two persons, which one is the ancient between the two? Thanks. N.R.Joshi
