There are only two groups mentioned in the two sentences of nirukta i quoted — grammarians and nirukta-kāras.  
  
There can be only two opinions here because this is a yes/no situation:  
  

\(1\) Yes — all nāmas have arisen from ākhyātas  
  

\(2\) No — not all nāmas have arisen from ākhyātas.  
  

If *eke* is interpreted as 'some' instead of 'all', then it automatically implies that there are some grammarians of the time of Yaska who believe in (1) instead of (2)  
  

If this is true, then why are their names not mentioned in the previous sentence? Thus, after considering paurvāparya, i said that all grammarians are on one side and Śākaṭāyana is on the other. I had already explained this in my previous message.
