नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

Are ShakatAyana and ShAkatAyana two different historical persons or one person?  

                                   -- Vidvan N R Joshi

  

There are two शाकटायनs a per the texts / references -

  

one is a वैयाकरण and the other is स्मृतिकर्ता \|

  

Patanjali under उणादयो बहुलम् says- (सर्वं नाम धातुजम् आह निरुक्ते) शकटस्य च तोकम् and in निरुक्तम् also there is reference . Both refer to the same person.

  

There is शाकटायनस्मृति ( see स्मृतिसन्दर्भः from Culcatta - I do not have this).

  

It is difficult to say whether both वैयाकरण and स्मृतिकार are different or one.

  

I think both are one (reference to the latter is also available in works such as निर्णयसिन्धु ।

  

धन्यो’स्मि
