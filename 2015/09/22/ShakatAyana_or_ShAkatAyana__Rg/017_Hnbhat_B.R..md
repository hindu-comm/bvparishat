We both know गार्ग्य and शाकटायन are both quoted by Panini in different Sutra-s and possibly both are grammarians.

  

The same question can be raised, why गार्ग्य is mentioned in addition to वैयाकरणानां चैके? Is Gargya not वैयाकरण or शाकटायन not considered वैयाकरण?

  

Therefore Durgacharya had no such a doubt like Rajwade and Hariprasad, as to the meaning of एके which is idiomatic and there were some grammarians who do not accept the view of शाकटायन and the statement itself gives it is acceptable to the majority of वैयाकरण-s.

  

  

In Vyakarana, there is Vyutpattipaksha and Avyutpattipaksha on the उणादयो बहुलम्, in accepting शाकटायन-s उणादिसूत्र, So this is the base for the two groups among Vaiyakarana-s. The antiquity of Yaska and Panini is debatable by those interested in chronology since both quote Shakatayana and Gargya in different contexts.--+---------
