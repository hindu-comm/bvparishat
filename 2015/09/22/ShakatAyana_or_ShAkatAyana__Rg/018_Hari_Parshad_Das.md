Thank you for your thoughts. I had thought about this when i read Rajwade's explanation. Even if the text of the Nirukta is taken as it is, some points should be noted:  
  

\(a\) Even if there were other grammarians on the side of Śākaṭāyana who were not very noteworthy, they could have been easily clubbed together by adding ādayaḥ. They do deserve a mention if at all they are worthy of being called grammarians.  

  

\(b\) Nirukta is a purely Vedic text so rules of laukika vyākaraṇa do not apply very strictly.  
  

\(c\) vyatyayo bahulam can be used to say that there is sup vyatyaya in vaiyākaraṇānām and instead it should be read as vaiyākaraṇāḥ. In this reading, eke can be interpreted as eka-varjitāḥ. So the reading will be — na sarvāṇi iti gārgyaḥ vaiyākaraṇāś caikavarjitāḥ.  
  
Of course, someone may say that this interpretation of eke is very creative but often in Vedic texts we have to resort to such creative interpretations, or else paurvāparya is not achieved. If this interpretation in line of what is suggested by Rajwade is taken, i see no harm because it reconciles both statements (something which Durgacharya's commentary does not, in my opinion).  
  

What matters is the intention behind the interpretation. I see an honest reconciliatory approach in Rajwade's interpretation and therefore I favor it.

I have tried to explain the existing reading in line with Rajwade's thought above.

These sources are good in interpreting the Nirukta in the direction shown by Durgacharya. I doubt if any one of them tries to propose something that goes against the understanding of Durgacharya. The Nirukta is a pre-panini text. Rajwade himself explains how in trying to interpret 'guṇenānvitau' in the next sentence of Nirukta, Durgacharya faced a major problem. By a cursory reading of the text of Nirukta (or any Vedic text for that matter), it will be clear that interpreting a text written in a pre-paninian grammar through Panini's rules is riddled with problems to say the least. This can be compared to compiling a C++ program in a C compiler. Unless lateral thinking is employed, we may remain stuck in the same place for eternity. Better to have tried and lost rather than have never tried at all.
