I do understand that the very reading 'vaiyākaraṇānām ca eke' creates a bit of a problem with the understanding I have presented, because even if vaiyākaraṇānām is taken in the sense of saṁjñā-nirdhāraṇa, there will be two possible meanings:  
  
(a) 'gārgyaḥ vaiyākaraṇānāṁ' (Gārgya among grammarians) OR  
(b) 'vaiyākaraṇānāṁ ca eke' (some among grammarians).  
  
If (a) is selected, then interpreting ca eke remains a problem. If (b) is selected, as Durgacharya has done, then reconciling by paurvāparya remains a problem.  
  

Therefore some interpreters do not favor the original reading itself. I am quoting here Shri Rajwade's Marathi translation:

I will render the highlighted portion into Hindi: 'वैयाकरणानां चैके' ऐसा न कहकर 'एक छोड़कर सब वैयाकरण' ऐसा कहना चाहिए क्योंकि केवल शाकटायन का नाम ऊपर बताया है ।  

  
Shri Rajwade suggests this because paurvāparya will force us to say that all grammarians of the time of Yāska were on one side and Śākaṭāyana was on the other. I was hoping that Durgacharya will say something in regards to this inconsistency but there was nothing there.
