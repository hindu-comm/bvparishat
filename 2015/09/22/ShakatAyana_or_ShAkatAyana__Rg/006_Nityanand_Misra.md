Dr. Vidyasankar Sundaresan is correct, although a precise translation ofन सर्वाणीति गार्ग्यो वैयाकरणानां चैके (na sarvāṇīti gārgyo vaiyākaraṇānāṃ caike)is

  

NM: *‘Not all,’ thus \[say\] Gārgya and some among the grammarians.*

  

Here is the translation by Lakshman Sarup (1967 reprint, MLBD, pp. [13](https://archive.org/stream/nighantuniruktao00yaskuoft#page/13/mode/1up)-[14](https://archive.org/stream/nighantuniruktao00yaskuoft#page/14/mode/1up)):

  

LS: *‘Not all,’ say Gargya and some of the grammarians.*

  

  

Why not‘some grammarians?’If the reading was वैयाकरणाश्चैके , the translation ‘some grammarians’ would have been accurate.However the reading is वैयाकरणानां चैके, with the genitive case in वैयाकरणानाम्.Thisgenitivecase (षष्ठी विभक्ति) is in निर्धारण (singling out one or more from many), explained by the rule यतश्च निर्धारणम्‌ (२.३.४१), which ordains bothgenitivecase (षष्ठी विभक्ति) and locative case (सप्तमी विभक्ति) when there is निर्धारण. A special characteristic of such षष्ठी is that it is not compounded, such compounding being prohibited by the rule न निर्धारणे (२.२.१०).Hence ‘some among the grammarians’/‘some of the grammarians’ is more precise than ‘some grammarians’ as the former makes the निर्धारण clear.

  

PS: In the महाभाष्य, पतञ्जलि makes a similar usage: While commenting on व्याकरणे शकटस्य च तोकम्, he says वैयाकरणानां च शाकटायन आह ‘धातुजं नामे’ति।
