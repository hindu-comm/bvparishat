Thank you Dr. Vidyasankar. I had quickly typed out whatever i remembered. Thus the translation was done very quickly. Its correct that there was a grammarian like Śākaṭāyana who agreed with the previous stance.  
  

The most accurate translation is as follows:

  
  
***na sarvāṇi iti gārgyaḥ vaiyākaraṇānāṁ ca eke***  
  

**Translation**: Not all nāmas have arisen from ākhyātas — this is the opinion of Gārgya and all grammarians (except Śākaṭāyana).  
  

The reason is that if there were other grammarians besides Śākaṭāyana who agreed with the previous stance, then the Nirukta-kāra would have mentioned them in the previous sentence. Niruktakāra only mentions a single grammarian Śākaṭāyanaḥ in the previous sentence and not Śākaṭāyanādayaḥ and thus it is clear that there was one and only one grammarian who adhered to the previous stance. All others grammarians of that time were grouped together in favor of the opposite stance.  
  

Also i agree with what Dr. Bhat said. We should focus on answering the main question. I think however that the original question has been answered because in another thread, Shri Joshi ji replied as follows:
