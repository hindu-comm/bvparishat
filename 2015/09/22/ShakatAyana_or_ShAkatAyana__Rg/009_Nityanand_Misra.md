To the best of my information, ‘eke/ityeke’ is common idiomatic usage in Sanskrit commentaries for ‘some/thus \[say\] some.’ The sarvanāma ‘eka’ when used in plural means ‘some’ (Monier Williams and Apte on ‘eka’ specify this), and not ‘all’ or ‘all others.’ This is often used in contrast ‘apare’ and ‘anye’ (eke ... apare = some ... some others, eke ... anye = some ... some others).

  

Besides, the genitive case in vaiyākaraṇanām is also to be explained. If it is by yataśca nirdhāraṇam‌ (PS 2.3.42) then nirdhāraṇa means singling out a subset from the universal set being referred to, and so, vaiyākaraṇanām eke = ‘some among/of the grammarrians.’ If the genitive case is not from nirdhāraṇam‌, then it must be explained too.
