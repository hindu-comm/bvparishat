Thanks, all I am saying is that the use of the sarvanāma ‘eka’ in plural to mean ‘all’ is not attested to in the lexicons I have seen (Apte, MW list meaning of plural‘eka’). Maybe some other kośa/lexicon lists ‘all’ as a possiblemeaning of ‘eka,’ but I am not aware.

  

It would be good to know how you interpret the use of genitive case in vaiyākaraṇānām. Due to nirdhāraṇam (PS 2.3.41 yataśca nirdhāraṇam) or something else?
