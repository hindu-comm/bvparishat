Namaste,

  

I have couple of questions.

  

Q-1)

  

I have read that during the early hours of dawn (before rise) on bhAdrapada shuddha chaturthi (gaNesha chaturthi), couple of typical constellations are visible which resemble gajamukha and mushaka.   

  

What does the astronomy say about these observations?

  

Q-2)

  

Right from the childhood, we have been reading "shamantakOpAkhyAnaM" as a concluding part of gaNEsha vrata and fear has been instilled in the minds about the ill-effects of sight of the moon on this day. 

  

While keeping aside the purANic story, I would like to know whether any subtle harmful radiations get emanated from the moon on gaNesha chaturthi night?

  

with warm regards,

Sriram
