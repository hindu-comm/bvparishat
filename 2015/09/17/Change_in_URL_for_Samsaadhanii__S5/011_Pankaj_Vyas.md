Respected Scholars,

Thank you very much for testing this tool. we still working on these issues, as we faced some problems earlier to implement these to the system. that's why we listed the sutras those we could not implement in the current version of this tool. because somewhere we need morph to assign the case and prefixes like आङ्. so I'm still thinking about these rules, how to implement? This is difficult but there may some way to find out solution. Bcs when we started this, the output was only 40-50% correct. Now it is more than 97% with given rules. you mentioned those examples where some extra information neede, that is we have already given the instruction before using this tool.

So once again thanks to all for their valuable feedback. we will solve these issues soon.
