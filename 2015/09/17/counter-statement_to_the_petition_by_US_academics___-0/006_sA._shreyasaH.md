Members will be shocked to know that there are huge electronic advertising billboards (at the busiest freeway interchange between San Francisco and Oakland, I-580 and I-80) carrying a picture of Modi with the caption ‘We oppose Modi’s regressive policies….”.

  

Looks like these crooks will go to any extent to denigrate the PM of India and the clear mandate of the world's largest democracy.
