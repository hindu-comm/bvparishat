Namaste,



Last month, a group of US-based academics posted online a highly biased [statement](http://academeblog.org/2015/08/27/faculty-statement-on-modi-visit-to-silicon-valley/) which accused the present Indian government of “disregard for human rights and civil liberties” and, by implication, urged business leaders in Silicon Valley not to collaborate with it:



A counter-statement was released in Delhi on September 15 by Madhu Kishwar, signed by 124 academics and intellectuals from India or overseas. It is now available online on [change.org](http://change.org) for further signatures:

If you agree with the counter-statement, may I request you to (1) sign the [change.org](http://change.org) petition, (2) forward this request to your own contacts so that more people may come to know of the counter-statement and endorse it, if they so wish.



Thanks,



Michel Danino
