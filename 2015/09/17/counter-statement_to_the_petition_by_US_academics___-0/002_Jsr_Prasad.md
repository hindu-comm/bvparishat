Namaste. I signed the petition. Another signature campaign is going on in the US led by Prof. Narayan Komerath, seeking signatures to a welcome letter to Sri Modi. It is meant exclusively for the faculty in the US and Canada. The form is available from [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1a9S6c-32NPyvl87_oMyT6dFcac4BXuSp8bQ8ToM-B1U/viewform?c=0&w=1).  

  

Thanks
