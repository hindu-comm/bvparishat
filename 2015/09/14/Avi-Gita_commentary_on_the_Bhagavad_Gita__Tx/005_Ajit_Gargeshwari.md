Dear Abhyankar ji,

The question asked by Shankara ji was “I would like to know whether this commentary was ever published separately. I would also like to know more about its author, Dhupakara Sastri.”



Sanakara ji is already aware that archives has Gita with 11 commentaries



Regards

Ajit Gargeshwari
