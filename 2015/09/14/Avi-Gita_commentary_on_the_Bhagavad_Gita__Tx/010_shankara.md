Deshpandeji,

  

Prof. Aklujkar had pointed out this to me in a personal message, soon after I posted the query at BVP. We are not yet sure whether Dhupakar Sastri's commentary on the Gita (based on the Marathi commentaries of Sant Jnanesvar and Vamana) was published separately? There is no entry of avi-gita at worldcat site too.



regards  
shankara
