Namo vidvadbhyah

  

'Bhagavad Gita with eleven commentaries' edited by Sri Gajanan Shambhu Sadhale Sastri and published by Gujarati Printing Press, contains extracts from a commentary named 'Avigita' by Dhupakar Sastri. I would like to know whether this commentary was ever published separately. I would also like to know more about its author, Dhupakara Sastri.

shankara
