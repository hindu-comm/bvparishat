I know of one Shri Shi.(possibly,Shivaram) Ha (Hari) Dhupkar,who was the Secretary or so in the Tilak Maharashtra Vidyapeeth,Sanskrit Exam.Section.That was somewhere in late 1960s and early 1970s. This Dhupkar Shastri might be from his family.The present TMV management or old Sanskrit Shastris/scholars from Pune/Maharashtra may help us in identifying him and letting us know whether the com.was ever published separately and from where.

Best luck in your efforts.
