Dear Indian colleagues,

  

Please refer the details below for a reprint of Samskrtam textbook from Miller and Knauer, 1891, which is out of press in Moscow. As per now 4 books are printed:

1\. Frisch’s Sanskrit Citanka. Reader. Vol. I (2nd ed.)

2\. Frisch’s Sanskrit Citanka. Vocabulary. Vol. II (2nd ed.)

3\. Knauer’s Sanskrit Grammar (3rd ed.)

4\. Miller-Knauer’s Sanskrit Textbook (4th ed.)

  

And at least 2 more are planned untilend of year. **If I will get help** in proofreading of Sanskrit dictionaries at <https://github.com/sanskrit-lexicon> - I will be able to print Reverse Sanskrit Dictionary this year as well - something not done for 40 years and not met in India nowadays:
