Respected Scholars,

While studying a manuscript, the writer quoted some sentences. I want original source of these sentences. Scholars are requested to help in it.

(1) समे यजेत  (In MS, it has been cited in Vidhi-prakaraNa)

(2) सन्दिग्धे तु वाक्यशेषात्

(3) तन्मनोऽसृजत  (This sentence has been cited in vedAnta paribhAShA also, but I couldn’t find the original source)

(4) यत्परः शब्दः स शब्दार्थः  (Is it from shlokavArtikam? It has been quoted in bhAmatI also)

Thanking you

Janakisharan Das
