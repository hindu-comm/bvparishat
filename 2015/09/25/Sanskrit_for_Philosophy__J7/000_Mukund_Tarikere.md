Dear All,

There is a very good news for the teachers and research scholars of Philosophy. The icpr has announced the level-1 programme on Sanskrit for Philosophy to be conducted at their Centre  at Lucknow from 23rd Nov. to 6th of December, 2015. This is a graded course to learn Sanskrit in Four levels. 50 participants will be selected for this on all India basis. **Only those who are ready to do all the Four levels will be admitted**. Last date for application is 18th October. Visit the website of ICPR ( [Indian Council of Philosophical Research, ICPR, New Delhi](http://www.icpr.in/) )

Remember this is an golden opportunity. The approach is to go to the structure of Sanskrit language from the original Texts.

  

Best wishes,

VNJha
