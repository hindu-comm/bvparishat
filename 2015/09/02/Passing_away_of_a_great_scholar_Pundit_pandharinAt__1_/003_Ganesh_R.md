Dear Sirs,  
  

The sad demise of Sri pandita pandharinathaachaarya Galagali is really a personal loss to me and it is needless to say the world of Sanskrit and even Kannada has lost a great scholar, poet and orator. He was a well known exponent of dvaita-vEdaanta and had good knowledge of other shaastra-s too.  
His brilliant prose and verse, embellished profusely with alliterations and imagery are unforgettable. Really blessed are those who have listened to him pouring out with melodious verses and hilarious anecdotes during his many talks and spontaneous expositions. He had a unique style of rendering verses in a very melodious way. His mentor Sri Galagali Ramaachaary of "madhuravaaNi" fame and he him self are worth figured in the annals of modern Sanskrit Literature.  

Apart from the champu-s, khanda-kaavya-s, strOtra-s and mahaakaavya-s penned by him in Sanskrit, his stupendous production of translating many puraaNa-s in to Kannada is unforgeable. In this mighty task, he has single handedly translated scores of thousands of verses with ease in to chaste Kannada.  
  

Being so friendly and jovial with youngsters, he always spread of the spirit of devotion and literate among the masses. May this wonderful scholar-poet attain Hari-saayujya.  
  

regards
