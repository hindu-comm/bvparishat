The ungrateful world of kannada hardly mentioned the names of eminent scholars like the great PHandarinathacharya even when he was alive.Though his contribution to kannada language and literature is enormous only Sanskrit students and scholars cherish his memory.He was truly a lilavilasabhumi of vagdevi saraswati. His yashahkaya is eternal and through his wonderful works he lives with the learned and the sahrdaya for ever.

My most respectful homage to the Acharya.
