I pay my homage to the great scholar. Remain in touch.

I am doing: do the needful:

  

Ph.D. classes





Dear Madam Leela

I took a few classes for Ph.D. at Rashtriya sanskrit Sansthan. It was a wonderful experience. Our students of M.Phil,Ph.D.and UGC do not fine an opportunity to intensive and advanced methodology due to lack of tutuion support. I hereby propose to deliver a few lectures at your institution. It does not require any finance for remuneration , TA etc. because financially I am sound. I may provide TEA to students as well. the only thing I require is a room to sit and teach for the lectures on the subject above. If interested consult your colleagues, students and all the recipients. Let me know after consultations. Take your time. It may be electronically supported by my sanskrit data Bank both orally and printed-points. It is in the interest of the students and not for me. Regards, spnarang

Arrange the classes, if needed. Varakhedi accepted it and I will do the classes in Banglore at the earliest. Best wishes and memories, spnarang

Yesterday I was in Haridwar at Karnataka Bhawan and Gurukul Kangri was happy to arrange my classes in Oct. Be happy spnarang
