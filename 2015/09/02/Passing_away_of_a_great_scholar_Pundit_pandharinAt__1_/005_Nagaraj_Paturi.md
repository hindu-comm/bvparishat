I felt ecstatic to read about this pumbhavasarasvatee.



My attention was specially drawn to the way he kept Sanskrit alive during the period when it is being considered otherwise. He chronicled Indian national movement through several of his Sanskrit works.



I nostalgically remembered my childhood when Ihad my Sanskrit and Maadhva stotra learning from similar Kannada Dvaita Vedanta Aacharyas with a similar spontaneous wit, sense of humouralongside colossal scholarship and my meditativeassociation with Guru Raghavendraru and all those sweet memories.



May the kaaraNajanma attain Hari-saalokya. s'As'vatavishNulOkanivAsasiddhirastviti bhavantah bruvantu.
