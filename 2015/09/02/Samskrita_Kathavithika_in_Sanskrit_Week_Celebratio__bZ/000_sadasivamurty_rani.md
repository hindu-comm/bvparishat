Respected Scholars,

Pranams to all of you. Successfully we have celebrated the Sanskrit Week Celebrations in our Vidyapeetha Premises. During the seven days we have had a variety of programs such as: 1. Bhajan Sandhya, 2. Kavitha Sandhya, 3. Sastra - Purana Sandhya, 4. Rasasandhya, 4. Various Competitions for internal and external students at School level, College level and University level etc. 

There has been a programme to specially emphasize up is SAMSKRITA KATHAVITHIKA on the penultimate day of the Valedictory i.e. on 31-08-2015. This Samskrit Kathavithika could be a dais for Social stories from our contemporary life. Teachers, Research scholars and students also participated in this event and presented 17 Social Stories with latest themes. This could be an innovative programme made every one happy. This is just to share with you all I have mentioned here. For your appreciation I attach here my storyअपर्याप्तस्समय: and request you to read it which is there in the attachment of this mail.

With warmest regards to all,
