Thanks to Sri. Ajit Ji

  

I got this book so fast, with 6 commentaries, a treasure indeed. Even though I was curious to see the commentary by Sri. Vachaspati Mishra (which was missing) nevertheless Sri. Sadashivendra Saraswati swami's vyakhyaa is excellent and done in both scholarly drishti and Yati's drishti.

  

Regards
