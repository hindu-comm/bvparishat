hariH OM,

Good intentions are often not enough. One needs good instruction. Whenever there is talk of similarity of religion, one forgets that the religions differ because of you know what? Their "differences".  
Calling Adi Shankara as "Buddha in disguise", as though it were some encomium does immense disservice to both. One just has to scan the body of work of Shankara cursorily to disabuse oneself of such notions.

The intent to subsume the Hindu identity into Buddhism doesn't fit with history.

The above may be too much to expect of a prime minister of today, but his advisors and speech writers ought to have known better.

svasti,  
 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,  
 shrivathsa.
