"The pejorative sense is not without reason" sounds as though you too, like those who used the expression " prachhannabauddha" , have scorn for Buddha.



"For many of them, including Bhaskara, there seem to be much similarities between the Buddhist philosophical concepts and those of Samkara, whom he intended to critique." Obviously . If those similarities did not 'seem' (appear?)to them, they would not havecalled Sankara a 'prachchhannabauddha'. Whether those similarities are really there are not is a different matter.



क्रमते न हि बुद्धस्य ज्ञानं धर्मेषु तायिनः ।



सर्वे धर्मा स्तथा ज्ञानं नैतद् बुद्धेन भाषितम् ॥ गौडपादकारिका 4-99



That Gaudapadacharya had to say, "नैतद् बुद्धेन भाषितम् " shows that wronglytakingcertain notions of Advaita Vedantaas Buddhist ideas was there by the time of Gaudapadacharya himself and he had to clarify saying, 'this is where Advaita Vedanta stands out distinctly from Buddhist ideas.



TheseAdvaita-Buddhism similarities and differences is a different matter.



But the fact remains that Buddhism, Jainism and Vedic tradition(under the title of 'Hinduism') are classified together into one single group called'Dharmic religions' by the scholars of Comparative Religion to distinguish them from say, Abrahamic or semitic religions. Dharmic religions have many other concepts apart from 'Dharma', such as jananamaraNachakra, kAlachakra etc. in common.



There were/are descriptions of Buddhism as 'protestant Hinduism' , as a 'subset of Hinduism' etc. by a certain strand of western scholarship too.Alexander Wynne's 'the origin of Buddhist meditation' and other such works do trace at least certain aspects of Buddhism to Vedic culture or texts .
