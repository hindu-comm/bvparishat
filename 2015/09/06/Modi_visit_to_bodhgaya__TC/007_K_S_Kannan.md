Many thanks to Sri Nityananda Misra for exposing the misreporting.

  

In these days of news (prepaid / postpaid), and journalists committed to ideologies (long deceased in the lands of their very birth), nothing is spared from misrepresentation and misinterpretation .

  

Thanks to Sri Nagaraj Paturi for supplying the right source.
