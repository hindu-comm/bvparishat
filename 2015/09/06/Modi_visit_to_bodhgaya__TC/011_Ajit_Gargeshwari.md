"Calling Shankara a pracchanna bauddha doesn't add any credit to the PM because the body of work of Shankara is very much there for one to read (so are the works of Buddha). Even a cursory reading will help remove such notions."  
  

I think this statement of Srivatsa ji requires a separate thread. There is parallelism between Shankara and Buddhism. Shankara has carefully shown how several Buddhist theory are incorrect according to his view. In my view a cursory reading will not remove such notions. There are a lot of elements which are common between Shankra and
Buddhist at least with Vijyana Vada  
  

If PM or any one expresses a view whats wrong. He hasn't called for any debate nor is he debating with scholars.  
  

To answer Dr. Raghavendra Bhat I don't know Prof Pandurangi' s
intention why he posted this article. Probably he wants a debate on the PM's speech
