About Buddha's silence (mentioned in GK), how can one confidently say that Gaudapada was referring to Lord Buddha. Gaudapada could be referring to Buddhaghosha, who was more likely the near contemporary of Gaudapada. In Brahmasutra bhashya Shankara has mentioned Sugata, which also fits in better with Buddhaghosha than with Lord Buddha.
