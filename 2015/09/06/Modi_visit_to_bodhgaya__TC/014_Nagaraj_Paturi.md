AadaraNiya AayushmAn Shrivatsaji :



Let us remove the TOI report from our analysis. Let us go by the version which the PM seems to agree with (it is on his website).



Yes, Let us remove the TOI report from our analysis.



Let us be cautious in using certain words. 'Hinduism' is one such word.Some conscious language engineering (manipulation), some callous use of words together lead to this modern non-insider's word 'Hinduism' get into currency and get gradually narrowed down to mean only thepro-Vedicside of Indian 'religious' culture as 'Hinduism'. But when the word was used by the original Persian travellers to India it was used in reference to all the culture of India that existed by the time of their visit. That culture included Buddhism and Jainism too.That usage covered even the folk religious practices such as village goddess worship etc. But recently there are attempts to describe the folk religious practices such as village goddess worship etc. too as 'non-Hindu'. Gradually thesemantic field of the word is attempted to get narrowed downas much as possible.



Apart from this, next pointis that there are indeed huge number of continuities between Vedic tradition and Buddhism apart from a few discontinuities. This is true about many such complexcontinuities between various strands ofpre-modern Indian culturealongside the discontinuities between the same. To emphasise the discontinuities hiding the continuities, emphasizing diversity hiding unity is being done by anti-India forces with an ulterior motive. It is high time the attempts are countered by doingjust the opposite: emphasizing the continuities and unity.
