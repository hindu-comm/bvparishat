Did the PM speak in English or Hindi? Anyway reading the speech from the link, appears like a shoddy piece of journalism by quoting out of context and misrepresenting what was actually said. Two quick examples:

  

*PM said*: Many scholars have analysed the impact of Buddha on Hinduism. In fact, Adi Sankara was even critiqued for the way he was influenced by the Buddha and Sankara was called as “Prachhanna Boudha" — meaning Sankara was Buddha in disguised form. That was the extent of influence of the Buddha on Adi Sankara, regarded by many as the tallest Hindu philosopher.

***TOI reported***: Referring to Adi Shankaracharya, the Prime Minister said that the spiritual leader is rightly regarded as 'Buddha in disguise'.  

  

The PM said Sankara critiqued and called as “Prachhanna Boudha." The TOI reports PM to have said that Sankara was rightly regarded as 'Buddha in disguise.' Is not the reporting misleading in presenting a view cited by a speaker as a view of the speaker?

  

*PM said:*This is how Swami Vivekananda praised Buddha. I quote:*At the time Buddha was born, India was in need of a great spiritual leader, a prophet.*

*Buddha never bowed down to anything, neither Veda, nor caste, nor priest, nor custom. He fearlessly reasoned so far as reason could take him. Such a fearless search for truth and such love for every living thing the world has never seen.Buddha was more brave and sincere than any teacher.Buddha was the first human being to give to this world a complete system of morality. He was good for good's sake, he loved for love's sake.*

*Buddha was the great preacher of equality. Every man and woman has the same right to attain spirituality— that was his teaching.I would personally call India Buddhist India as it has imbibed all the values and virtues of the teachings of Buddha by their religious scholars incorporating them in their literature.*

*TOI reported*: There was so much in common between Hinduism and Buddhism, he said, that he felt like calling India as 'Buddhist India'.

  

From the italics in the text of the speech by PM, it appears the statement *I would personally call India Buddhist India as it has imbibed all the values and virtues of the teachings of Buddha by their religious scholars incorporating them in their literature* appears as a personal view of Vivekananda, who the PM was citing. The statement in TOI report presents it as a personal view of the PM. And the reason is completely different (teachings absorbed versus commonality).

  

Just to show how media reports are not entirely credible.
