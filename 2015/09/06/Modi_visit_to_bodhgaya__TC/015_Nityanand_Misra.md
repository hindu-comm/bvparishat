1\) There are two opposing views on a topic within Hindu traditions. The PM subscribes to one of the views.  

2\) To a mainly Buddhist audience, the PM says that in his view Hinduism and Buddhism form an amalgam.

  

The PM made a diplomatic and a political speech (even if he did not, he is entitled to a view). He was not presenting a paper at a conference nor claiming subject matter expertise. I am not sure if dissection and analysis of each and every statement is needed: nobody would agree 100% with every statement made by the PM in the numerous speeches he makes. As Ajit Ji rightly says, he is neither debating nor calling for a debate.
