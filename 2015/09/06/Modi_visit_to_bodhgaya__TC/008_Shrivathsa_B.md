hariH OM,

Let us remove the TOI report from our analysis. Let us go by the version which the PM seems to agree with (it is on his website).

1\. Adi Sankara was even critiqued for the way he was influenced by the Buddha and Sankara was called as “Prachhanna Boudha" — meaning Sankara was Buddha in disguised form.  
2. That was the extent of influence of the Buddha on Adi Sankara, regarded by many as the tallest Hindu philosopher.  
3. At the mass level Buddha was so venerated that Jayadeva in his Geeta Govinda even praised him as Mahavishnu or God himself who descended to preach Ahimsa.  
4. So, Hinduism after the Buddha’s advent became Buddhist Hinduism or Hindu Buddhism. They are today an inseparable amalgam.  
5. The Vivekananda quote which says "*I would personally call India Buddhist India*".

Shankara was critiqued as pracchanna bauddha, so what? PM quoting this is either out of context or quoted in agreement (there is no rebuttal of the critique, not only this, it forms a part of the larger narrative in the talk).

The above is now combined with jayadeva etc. to form a cocktail to drive down the message of Buddhism = Hinduism and vice versa. No. Not only this, now it is an amalgam. Which begs the question as to how you can call two things apart from each other when they form an amalgam? What is compromised here is the truth that sanaatana dharma and dharmis have even given shelter to parsis, syrian christians, jews etc. without forming amalgams with them. That they tolerated Buddhism seems unsurprising.

The Vivekananda quote isn't out of context at all. We quote either to buttress / agree with something or to disagree. Here it seems the former. Else what is the purpose of quoting something at all?

Calling Shankara a pracchanna bauddha doesn't add any credit to the PM because the body of work of Shankara is very much there for one to read (so are the works of Buddha). Even a cursory reading will help remove such notions.

svasti,  
 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,  
 shrivathsa.

Please read‘was critiqued’ in place of ‘critiqued’
