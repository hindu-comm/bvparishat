1\. There are formal courses of smArta conducted by pIThas and Sanskrit institutes/universities. There are parIkshas conducted at the end of the course. Only those who are approved by the parIkshAdhikAris are 'certified' to 'practise'.



2\. When it is the appointment to a post of archakas a certificate in archaka course is stipulated for recruitment. But since smArta practice is not throughsuch a formal appointment, there is a scope for those who are not properly trained also to lad into practice.



3\. Particularly in the case of smArta practice in countries outside India, the fascination for a foreign life is making those who are not properly trained too to use their 'connections' to somehow go abroad and start practising in those countries. At least in countries like US, it can be made formal to check certified credentials before seeking paurohitya from a purohita.
