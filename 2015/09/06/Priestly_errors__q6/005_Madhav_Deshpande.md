Dear Shrivathsa-ji,

  

Thanks for your detailed and interesting response. In my near 70 years of lifetime, I have been observing the linguistic performance of Hindu priests, both in India and here in the USA where I have lived for the past 47 years, and have published an article on this topic, some twenty years ago. In the instance, I just reported, there was a new deviation from the norm that I had observed all these years. All the same, the insufficient training of the priests is a major problem. One of my close friends here in Michigan performs as a priest, and, while he is reading from a correctly printed pothi, he goes on randomly adding anusvāras and visargas to words (e.g. astuḥ, nārāyaṇāyaṃ namaḥ etc.).
When I told him that this was not correct, he was upset and said that he was exactly following what his Guruji used to do.
