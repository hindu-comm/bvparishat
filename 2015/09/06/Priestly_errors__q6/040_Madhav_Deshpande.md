Some folks acting as Hindu priests in the US with no actual background of priestly practice are innovating what is to be said and carried out.
Some of them are engineers in their day job and become priests just by reading a printed pothi. There was an inter-religious marriage with a Hindu girl and and a christian boy. The marriage was to be officiated jointly by a Hindu priest and a Christian priest. After the bride and the groom garlanded each other, the Hindu priest said they should feed sweets to each other. The next step was an innovation. The Hindu priest said: Now the Hindu and the Christian priests should feed each other, and he started putting the sweets in the mouth of the Christian priest, who happened to be a woman. The Christian priest was aghast and moved back.
