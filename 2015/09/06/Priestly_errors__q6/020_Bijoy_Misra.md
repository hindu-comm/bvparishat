Talking about the casualness and deception by the priests, I had the most sorrowful experience  

at Gaya last summer. Not only the priest did not know Sanskrit, but he knew that he was setting a  

trap. Gaya has been a traditional pilgrimage for the after-death rituals. While I did shout at some of  

those useless hoodlums, I discovered that the deception was more widespread and deeply entrenched.  

Hinduism would need major reform for its continuous use in the coming centuries.  
  

Talking about the wedding vow, I loved the मोक्षे च even though I don't know where it might come from.
