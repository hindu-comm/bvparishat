Namaskara,  
 I can really understand your feeling we forget what we are having is because of what we are, we get knowledge from books and not by practice and behavior comes from practice, and behavior is education if have the right behavior we will be with time and time is everything, and we can see it from past.  
As our knowledge is from books we refer the books to our convenience and we are master we have certificate's from university no body can question us, we can gain or loose knowledge through discrimination and books doesn't teach it.  
 We have changed the goal in life from education to economy, we can achieve economy through education but we cannot achieve education through economy because we'll not know what it is economy what a pathetic condition we are in, what we sow so can be reaped.  
 So what is the solution after all the talk, the solution is the "I" has to change in understanding not merely knowing, through books I think we are only become encyclopedia that is knowing not understanding.  
  
Inthi,  
B S Ravindranath,
