\> Prof HNBhat has aptly cited the famed verse paurohityam etc. The second line there has mAThApatyam . (I have seen people use the word gANApatyam also). Should it not be mAThapatyam (and gANapatyam similarly) from maThapati (and gaNapati respectively) ? Is there a justification for the second dIrgha ?

It can be justified as grammatical by including both into अनुशतिकादि considered as आकृतिगण.

अनुशतिकाऽदीनाम् चl७।३।२०l

which enables both vowels elongated for the words in the list.

If one is hesitant of extending the list as आकृतिगण, it can be considered as wrong grammatically and elongation would be considered as for metrical purposes.
