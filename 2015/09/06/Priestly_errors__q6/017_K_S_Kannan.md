I do not want to open a new thread as I want but a small clarification .

  

Prof HNBhat has aptly cited the famed verse *paurohityam* etc. The second line there has *mATh**A**patyam* . (I have seen people use the word *gAN**A**patyam* also). Should it not be *mATh**a**patyam* (and *gAN**a**patyam* similarly) from *maThapati* (and gaNapati respectively) ? Is there a justification for the second *dIrgha* ?

  

Is it just for the sake of the metre in the verse cited?
