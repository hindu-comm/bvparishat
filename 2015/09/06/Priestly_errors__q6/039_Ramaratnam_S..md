While the errors of the purohita is a chaos, those of the performer is a catastrophe. Even simple things are not adhered to by the performer. When the priest instructs 'say *mama*' the performer mechanically repeats 'say *mama'* instead of simply uttering *'mama.'*

There is a story. The priest placed a lump of havis on the hand of the performer and asked him to offer it into the fire. Not listening to the instruction properly he put it into his mouth. The priest shouted 'Blasphemy, blasphemy, you should have offered it into the holy fire.' The performer realised his mistake, took out the havis from his mouth and offered it into the fire. The priest cried again, 'Oh, my God, the fire is polluted now.' The performer responded, 'Oh, polluted? Let me purify it.' He took out water from the pot and poured it into the fire. The whole thing was gone.
