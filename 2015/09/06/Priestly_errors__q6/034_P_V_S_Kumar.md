Prof. Deshpande Ji,

  

 As you have pointed out inyour close friend's case, the Guru-Sishya parampara is one of thesourcesforthe corruption in the subject material. In the process of transition from one generation to another generation, each sishya is corrupting 1 or 2 percent of what he is expected to receive from his guru. Over generations, it gets accumulated toglaring proportions. Reasons for this could be various: lack of knowledge of language and subject matter, gainadvantage over his peers, etc. This trend is not limited to paurohitya alone, it is common amongtraditional musicians as well. 

  

Regards

P V S Kumar
