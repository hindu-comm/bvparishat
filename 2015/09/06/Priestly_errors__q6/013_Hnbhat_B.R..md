A great paNDita of our times, the late shrii anantarAmayya of bangalore had written a book (in kannaDa) to help purohitas tide over their small and big errors. My sAmavedAcArya, shrii sheShaNNa wrote books on pUrvaprayoga, aparaprayoga, upAkarma, nityAhnika, etc. and distributed hundreds of those books for free. Not only this, he used to invite purohitas to learn what they conduct properly. Not many seemed to take it beyond a few days. It seemed too difficult for them to be told that they were wrong, moreover, they didn't see any value addition in improving themselves as they were doing quite well otherwise.

Imagine the first experience of the author of this verse with the professional Paurohitya that made him say:

*हित्यं रजनिचरितं*ग्रामणीत्वं नियोगो माठापत्यं ह्यनृतवचनं साक्षिवादः परान्नम् ।  
ब्रह्मद्वेषः खलजनरतिः प्राणिनां निर्दयत्वं मा भूदेवं मम पशुपते जन्मजन्मांतरेऽपि ॥ - शिवापराधक्षमापणस्तोत्र.

either it be Shankaracharya as popularly known or any later Poet!
