I feel that the word mOkShE ca is deliberately excluded in that smaarta-mantra (if it can be called so) as mOkSha, according to our larger tradition is a value that can only be achieved by the individual without any others' participation unlike the other three values Sharma, artha, and kaama. That is why it is termed as apavarga, as against the trivarga. Even the shruti-s and the guru-s can only be of instrumental help. While in the case of trivarga it is not so. And also mOkSha is nirupaadhika while the others are sOpaadhika. That's why irrespective of age and gender, sociocultural orders, politicoeconomic statuses and other attributes, one has to achieve absolute liberation on his/her own. As mOkSha is nothing but absolute Experience, none can offer or transfer or grant or even prevent it. Professor M. Hiriyanna's writings on values shed a lot of light on these issues.
