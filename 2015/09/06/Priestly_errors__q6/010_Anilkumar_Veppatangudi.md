The declaration the bridegroom makes that he will not transgress his would be wife's wishes in Dharma, Artha and Kama appears during the Kanya Dana ritual. धर्मॆ च अर्थे च कामॆ च नातिचरामि ।

is what he promises.

Kanya Dana ritual itself is not mentioned in most of the Grihya Sutras and has been added subsequently. One possible reason could be that during Panigrahana, the groom says that the bride is a gift from Gods in order that he becomes a house holder and they live to see 100 autumns. Therefore, the question of the bride's father giving away the bride during Kanya Dana mightnothave appeared right.

Regarding whether Moksha also is to be included, it is the last of the Purusharthas after the Gruhastha has observed rituals(Dharma),earned money(Artha) and fulfilled desires(Kama). According to the Ashrama system, one takes up Sanyasa renouncing all external relationships including his family in order to attain Moksha. Therefore, it is difficult to see the wife's role in Moksha. Of course, one can argue that there are many ways of attaining Moksha.

Our ritualistic tradition has always been open to change and it is therefore very difficult to be dogmatic about any part of it.
