Namaste,

  

We may think that it is difficult to find good priest these days, but when was it not so? Even in the times of Vashishtha, he had to persuade knowledgeable Vedic scholars of his time to take up pauruhitya, more as a sort of sacrifice, in order to help people perform the religious rites. That is because nobody was interested to take up priesthood. I am happy that today there are still many good priests around.

  

Secondly, If I am permitted to say so, the Chittasuddhi is the most important aspect in the rituals and that is why at the end of the rituals we say that we may be pardoned for the inadvertent mistakes in performing the rituals.

  

I agree that it should be our efforts to encourage good scholars to take up pauruhitya, like Vashishtha did in the ancient times.

  

Regards,

Sunil KB.
