The paddhatis or conventions followed in ones family is whats thought. The broad frame work one can find in printed by texts the finer details are mastered seeing how the rituals are performed and which mantras are used in the family of the practitioners If one shows a practitioner what you practice is in variance with Grahya sutras he is not going to even take a look into it. Frits Staal stall in his book Agni points this fact the variation that exists between the texts and actual practice.
