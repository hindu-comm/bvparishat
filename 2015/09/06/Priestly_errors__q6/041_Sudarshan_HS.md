नमस्करोमि माधववर्यम् ।

  

नातिचरामीति स्थाने अतिचरामीत्युक्तवति पुरोहिते नास्ति कोपि विस्मयः । :-)

तत्र यजमानानां ज्ञानह्रास एव कारणमिति अस्मत्पुरोहिता आहुः । उच्यते - तिष्ठन्मूत्रगृहस्थस्य धावन्मूत्रः पुरोहितः, इति।

  

ततो जिज्ञासे यदस्य आभाणकस्य सम्पूर्णं पद्यं कुतः किमिति?

  

\- इति सुदर्शनः
