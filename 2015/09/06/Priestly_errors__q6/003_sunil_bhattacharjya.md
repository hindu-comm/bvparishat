Dear Prof. Deshpandeji,  
  
You have rightly said that omission of "na" is a mistake.  
  

As regards wife's role in Moksha, one may not find fault with that. In Yogavashishtha there is indeed a Brahmajnani lady who imparts Brahmajnana to her husband. Further in Tantrik sadhana also one's wife is the best partner one can have, as the Mahanirvana tantra indicates.  
  

Regards,
