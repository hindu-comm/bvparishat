Thank you Prof Deshpande ji for sharing your article with the list. On a general note may I request scholars on this list who write all the time to share as and when the context calls for, academic articles or excerpt from their writings with the group. I understand one cannot share everything one writes due constraints imposed by publisher but whats permissible should be shared This will enable many young scholars to think about alternatives and possibilities about whats going on in Sanskrit and Indological research in this country and around the world at least on topics discussed in threads
