hariH OM,  
  
 Thank bhagavaan if he didn't say the "mA\~Ngalyam tantunA" and "gRRibhNAmi te" himself rather than have the groom say it.  
  

 Seems like it is your first such experience with purohitas and their ways. A great paNDita of our times, the late shrii anantarAmayya of bangalore had written a book (in kannaDa) to help purohitas tide over their small and big errors. My sAmavedAcArya, shrii sheShaNNa wrote books on pUrvaprayoga, aparaprayoga, upAkarma, nityAhnika, etc. and distributed hundreds of those books for free. Not only this, he used to invite purohitas to learn what they conduct properly. Not many seemed to take it beyond a few days. It seemed too difficult for them to be told that they were wrong, moreover, they didn't see any value addition in improving themselves as they were doing quite well otherwise.  
  
 One cannot blame the ignorant (first category, more in number) purohitas too much. After all, there aren't many who are as observant as you. Generally in any "function", the purohita serves more of a ceremonial position. The bride and groom plan their post marriage "rituals" more meticulously than the actual marriage. If the purohita knows the mantras properly (second category, lesser in number), and sees that the bride and groom are not interested, he will also perform perfunctorily. It is because of the apathy of people that many scholars (such as my RRigveda AcArya) keep away from officiating functions (except for those where they know about the shraddhaa of those involved). One needn't go into details the actual learning of purohitas these days: staying (if at all) in some gurukula for a year or two, to learn what they think is enough for them, find a "Godfather" in some city, work under him for a few years, launch their own independent careers etc. etc. All that is quite gory. Paurohitya these days has descended to the level below a joke. It is verily a farce. All that is expected of a purohita (shikShA, shraddhA etc.) are thrown to the wind.  
  

 If one compiles hilarious anecdotes about purohitas from my own little experience and those heard from others, one may end up with material worth a book. One which comes top of mind is a purohita in a friend's marriage. He was conducting pUrNAhuti for lAja homa. Another female friend of mine asked me quite loudly... "but there is no pUrNAhuti in a lAja homa". I asked her to keep quiet because she was within earshot of the purohita and the groom!  
  

 This being the state of marriage which is the most celebrated among the saMskAras, one needn't talk about apara or shrAddha. Not many these days take apara seriously. All that they want is for the body to be burnt (this much, thankfully, they care).  

  

svasti,  

 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,  

 shrivathsa.
