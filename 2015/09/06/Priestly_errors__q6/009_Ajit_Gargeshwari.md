Priests are highly commercial. My family priest who used to come to our house walking now has stylish SUV and and fancy mobile phone. One has to fix up with him 3-6 months in advance if you need his services. His service charge is so high that there is no point in calling him for small functions. There are not many good priests in cities who can recite mantras. I have seen priests performing ceremonies of different vedas they are not aware of paddhatis There is a temple near my house who does arati seeing the road.If a big car passes by his loudness of mantra recital increases by several decibels.  
  

Normally in cities people who perform pujas do it for fun. They do so as they are forced by family elders to do it. They have no interest in the rituals. My friend during his marriage bribed the priest Rs 5,000 so that he quickly finishes the ceremonies as he was not used to sitting on the floor and if he sat for along time he used to get cramps. Most of those who conduct ceremonies want to quickly finish the rituals and participate in fun with relatives and friends. The ritual is not the focus in marriage or a puja. We have 1 hour marriages to 3 days marriages.  
  

The quality of priests too vary was we have third grade teachers in schools and collages whose numbers are increasing we do have third grade priest officiating rituals. Its often said the papa of not conducting ceremonies goes to the priests so why bother let him utter some mantras. I pay his money he eats well and lets be done with it is the attitude.
