Namaste



To what aspect of Vedic professional are we mapping the ' Priest' in this discussion ? Is it to ' Purohita' specifically when invoking Acharya Shankara's (?) composition? This is just pitting the quote ' वेदो नित्यमधीयतां, तदुदितं कर्म - स्वनुष्ठीयताम्, तेनेशस्य विधीयतां अपचितिः’ ' against the quote ' पौरोहित्यं रजनिचरितं ...'



I request the scholars on the august forum to help with a clarification on 'Priestly errors', where the axiomatic error of translation and mismatch- mismap of the vedic Samskruth term ' Purohita = Priest' runs unquestioned / un noticed ! The lexicographers translation of vedic Samskruth term 'purohita'- a noble vedic professional, responsible for officiating the 'Yoga-Samskaara / vaidika-karma-kaanda' in 'Varna-Ashrama Dharma Shaastra' frame work as ' one holding charge or commission, an agent' has carried unspecified overload of theological perspective :





\[<https://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MWScan/2020/web/webtc/indexcaller.php>\]

purohita : (H3) \[Cologne record ID=126127\] \[Printed book page 635,2\]

puro—hita mfn. (puro-.) placed foremost or in front, charged, commissioned, appointed

**puro—hita m. one holding a charge or commission, an agent \[ID=126127.1\] **

**(esp.) a family priest, a domestic chaplain, RV. &c. &c. (RTL. 352 &c. ) \[ID=126127.2\]** 





A 'Purohita' is different from ' Yaajaka, Acharya, aagamika , Adhvaryu, Pravachankaar, katha-kar..... The skills, scholarship,
training - practice- lifestyle- profession standards are different for each one; and obvious enough, the errors made by one professional cannot be loaded -transferred to another profession. The root error in training faulty professionals is hiding somewhere else).



***Two Question/s which come up in this context are the following***:



a) Has any one documented a detailed study of the social- dynamics of 'Vaidika - Purohita- Shikshana' within tradition ? To identify the down grading of professional training standards from 'Dharma Shaastra set
standard' to ' Hindu Priest' religion worker model ? 



b) The role played by (Western and Indian/ Oriental )University education models of 'Vedic and Sanskrit Studies' in diluting and denigrating the ' Panini-Patanjali- Yaska' standards for 'Samskruth studies' and dependent professions in society' ? 





***Grounds for raising the question ( leaving out the social implications issues)***: 



The standard for 'Vaidkia Purhoita Vrutti'- A professional who is authorized to practice and administer 'Vedic Ritual' as a ' Purohita' ( and allied professions like Yaajaka, archaka, Acharya, daivajna....) comes from Dharma Shaastra works accepting 'Vedas' and guiding the
learning - practice' norms . The language of rites of passage and chants was to be set to the standard norm of ' Shadanga-Vedanga - Shikshana' and 'Samskara'. Accepting the fact that there were some 'black sheep' in the team who made a bad practice and brought ignominy to the profession, there were also people of excellence who were respected for their powers to deliver the promised benefits of Vedic ritual'. ( I refrain from brining in the current period society and faith in 'Yajna- Vastu - Tantra- Mantra- Jyotish' for debate here. The fact stands that there is a break down in the understanding of the tradition, the practice. The gap is filled by half-truth claims and fakes who cannot stand a full audit by traditional standards or texts or expected level of achievement. When the Paninian tradition spoke of 'Samskruth grammar to be the clinching guidance provider on the word like ' indra-shatro vardhasva'- for the Swara - to be used by the intended Samasa ( as tatpurusha or bahuvreehi) , while rendering the ' oblation' in a 'yajna', When Patanjali defined 'Why study Samskruth as 'Shabda- anushaasanam (laukika and vaidika), When Yaska provided the multilayered model of understanding the 'Meaning and Application of Vedic Terms', we do see a reference frame work for training and certifying a ' Purohita'. This standard is totally different from the
standards set for training a ' Priest' ( - a term from Abrahamic traditions ; who stands in between a 'Bishop, and a 'deacon' )



The ' Vaidika-Purohita' Professional is signified in Rigveda ( 1-1-1) as ' Agni'. Learning of Samskrutham in the prescribed way and using it properly is a respectable and responsible profession. The highest professional of this line is called a ' Rushi /Maharshi / Brahmarshi / Gotra -pravartaka Rushi'. The 'Guru-Kul' was a model institution to train such professionals and graduate them out to society. If 'Purohita' was a ' bad, undesirable profession', the tradition would not have given a high status to ' Purohita' in the Varna- Ashrama society'.



The 'derogation of profession' has been noted in the anchors quoted ascribed to 'Shankaracharyas compositions'! Does it endorse that ' Acharya Shankara ( of Adviata Vedanta siddhanta)' despised the ' professionals who followed the practice of Vedas' ? . This is to open up the flip-flop stand that seems to run amongst many 'traditional Vedantins' that 'Acharya Shankara taught Vedanta (sans Vedas) and gave freedom from practice of 'Karma-Kanda' ( including the regular sanshyaa - upaasanaa !) . If this were to be so, how would one justify all the commentary on Gita (18 1 to 10) by Acharya?
