Hi,

  

Not touching the "Karmakaand/ Paurohitya" Do's or Do-not's but the whole thread makes me feel sorry for the situation.

  

The situation is not only for the people doing Paurohitya, It is at every level, strata, class of the Indian society. The aim and goals of the life in India for most of us has been to survive and excel in mere rat race. The culture of Brahmins has turned into that of Shudras. Nothing is for society, for charity, not for commercial use. We are still living in the mode as we used to live in before independence (last 1000 years), where main goal of your life was to survive by any way. Not just survival but to deposit for our future generations as well, to satisfy our ego.

  

I live in Delhi region and see that whatever all revered scholars have called out is true. Recently I visited Pushkar (Rajasthan) for my father's Tarpan/ Shraadh. The Panda I got their was so uneducated that leave aside Sanskrit, he don't know what to do in Tarpan. His main aim was to get money out of our hands. I regreted I have done it myself. I have seen so many temples/ Sanskaar karm which are managed by un-educated Purohits. Hindu mass is also not have faith due to the varying standards followed by these Purohits.

  

There is not just scarcity of teachers, but of the students also. No one wants to stay in service of the Guru, they are just waiting to get something by which they can earn, without thinking that would help in go long term.

  

Insecurity of the lifestyle is the biggest player. All of us who are discussing this here are well offs, but on the ground for a person to live (un)happily, he need money so he can't wait to think on education, goals, philosophy etc. Everything is commercialized. After all it is not going to be Satyug in Kaliyug.

  

My 2 cents:

What we could do is as for charity we could educate some students, without any propaganda So that they know what it is all about. That is the only hope. If we are on good Acharan, certainly who come in contact also gets infected by the goodness. Krishna is Krishna because he gives knowledge on the war-ground, not from his palace.

  

Thanks,

Alankar
