Dear all  
Mr Alessandro Battistini from Italy asked me about Apashabdaabhaasa alankara. He just wanted to know that whether its definition is found in any earlier Alanlarashastra book. Even I tried searching Bhoja Mammmata etc but could not find. In Padukasahasra Vedantadesika has used this alankara and also in Devisataka by Anandavardhana. Please, if anyone finds that definition quoted in earlier works inform  
Thanks  
KP
