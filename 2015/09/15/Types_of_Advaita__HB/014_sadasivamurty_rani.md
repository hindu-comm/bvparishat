Several scholars have already given their valuable replies to this question. In this context I too would like to add some of the thoughts
regarding the present question. As the question is missing some required clarity I would like to present some possible variations of thoughts in response to this question.

  

Instead of calling them Types of Advaita if we have freedom to rename them there can be three variations:

Variation 1. Pre Sankara Sources of Advaita or Monism

Variation 2. Pre Sankara Doctrines of Philosophy not merely confining to Advaita

Variation 3. Post Sankara Advaita followers

  

**Variation 1:****Pre Sankara Sources of Advaita or Monism**

As it has already been answered by Scholars Prasthana Traya is the main source of Advaita.

Besides those three some Vedic instances like: *Nasadiya Sukta, Skambha Sukta, Ucchista Brahma Sukta, Aditi Sukta, Kala Sukta* and citations like "ekam sat. Vipraah bahudha vandanti" etc., too support the Monism to a considerable extent.



One major text to mention in the pre-Sankara times on Advaita is Mandukya Karikas of Gaudapada. It is also an elucidation of Mandukyopanishad only.

  

According to some Scholars the influence of Sunyavada and Vijnanavada of Buddhistic tradition is dominant on Sankara in the process of evolving his Doctrine though he thoroughly refuted these two schools in his writings.

  

**Variation 2****Pre Sankara Doctrines of Philosophy not merely confining to Advaita**

There were many pursuits by many known and unknown philosophers belonging to orthodox and heterodox systems of philosophy prevalent in the Pre Sankara Times.

They can be classified into the following three streams:

1\. Six Systems Orthodox Stream : Nyaya, Vaiseshika, Sankhya, Yoga, Purva Mimamsa and Vedanta Schools

2\. Three Major Systems Heterodox Stream: Charvaka school, Jainism and Buddhism

3\. Some minor systems refuted by all the above major schools:

a\) Akriyavadins of Pre Bauddha times laid down by Purna Kashyapa b) Jadavada or Ucchheda Vada of Ajita Kesha Kambala c) Sashvata Vada of Prakritha Katyayana

d\) Anischiti Vada Sanjaya Vellanthi Putra e) Aajiivaka Vada of Mankhali Gopala which was also called Niyati Vada. The other name of Mankhali Gopala was Maskari Gopala.

  

**Variation 3**: **Post Sankara Advaita followers**

During the times of post Sankara Advaita followers there it seems the revival of accepting the thoughts from the two schools :i. Sunyavada and ii. Vijnanavada of Buddhism which were refuted by Sankara and as a result two schoos: Sunya Vivarta Vada and Vijnana Vivarta Vada came into existence.

  

I hope that this information may be of some use in the present context.

  

Warm regards,

**Dr. Rani Sadasiva Murty**
