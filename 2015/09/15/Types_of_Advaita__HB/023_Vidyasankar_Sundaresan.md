Just a helpful question. Did you mean to inquire about types of Vedanta, not types of Advaita? I was going to talk of what are described as bhAvAdvaita, kriyAdvaita, etc, but desisted, seeing the progress of this discussion's trajectory.

  

A must read is the two-volume book by Hajime Nakamura (English translation from Japanese) on the history of Pre-Sankaran Vedanta. It is encyclopedic in scope and a refreshing change from the Paul Hacker kind of analysis of the history of a key darshana.

  

Best regards,

Vidyasankar
