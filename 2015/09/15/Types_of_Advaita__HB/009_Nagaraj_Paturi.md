This is in response to Professor Shankarji Jha's



\>\>So far as I know, there is wider doctrinal difference among these types.



His post doesn't seem to be stemming from the lack of knowledge that the three are sources of Vedanta.



He seems to be questioning the very grouping ofthe three into one as prasthAnatraya,; he seems also to be questioning theassumption ofan EkavAkyatA between them; he seems to disagree with calling them all together as one single entity called Vedanta.



Heseems to be saying that there is noEkavAkyatA between the three.



The grouping of the three into three as prasthAnatraya was not questioned bypost-Sankara Vedantins such as Ramanuja, Madhva etc. too. All these AchAryas believed that there was EkavAkyatA between the three. This EkavAkyatA was sought to beshown by them through their citing from the other two, while explaining one of them.



Professor Jha would do well to point out the points of difference between the three to be able to inspire the comments he solicited in his post.

Nagaraj
