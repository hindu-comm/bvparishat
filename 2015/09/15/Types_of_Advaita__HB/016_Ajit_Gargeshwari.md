All researches have confirmed that there were several schools of advaita Vedanta before Shankara. Shankara himself says there were many in Bhashya. Shankara or his school never says shankara was the founder of Advaita but was an acharya of great eminence in that school of thought  

  
Yes if one wants to know a list of schools within vedanta any standard text on the subject can be read that is a different question.  

  
Dr Bhat Says "a simple question It seems that the simple question on the types of advaita was over complicated.'  
  

No the question wasn't clear from the first post. If one uses words such as "Types of adavita" naturally different scholars might interpret the question differently There is no meaning to the phrase "Types of Vedamta" are there Types of Philosophy or Types of Geography?

  
  
"I am not sure any History of Advaita lists these titles as variety of Advaita Vedanta"  
  

There are two major prasthanas within advaita school is well known and all texts on history on vedanta take up this topic.  
  

" independent theories like विशिष्टाद्वैत than modified Advaita being common to them s their names suggest."  
  

I don't think so. The siddhantas of Vishista Advaita Dvaita and Advaita don't have much in common. The source texts of all schools of Vedanta are Prasthana Trayi an for some schools agamas as well.
