Brahma Sutra, Upanishads and Bhagavadgita are called the Prasthana Traya. Each Veda has four sections- Mantra Samhita, Brahmanas, Aranyakas and Upanishads- a transition from prayers to rituals to contemplation to philosophy. Since Upanishads are at the end, they are called Vedanta- the end of Vedas. Advaita and other philosophies have emerged out of Upanishads.
