This is true. In fact one grouse of Dvaitins against Vishishtadvaitins is that the latter is only a 'vishishta' advaita. It can also be noted that Dvaita has been described as 'brahmādvitīyavāda' where no second Brahman is admitted. That way they too can be a type of 'advaita.'

  

One can also add: śaktiviśiṣṭādvaita, where Devi is held to be the Supreme, too to the list, if one wants.

  

While talking about 'schools of Vedanta' prior to Shankara, we get one sentence in the Shānkara bhāṣya:

  

  

In the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 2.1.20 bhashyam Shankaracharya makes a very far reaching statement:

सर्वोपनिषत्सुहि विज्ञानात्मनः परमात्मना एकत्वप्रत्ययो विधीयत इत्यविप्रतिपत्तिः सर्वेषामुपनिषद्वादिनाम् ;  

// sarvopaniShatsu hi vijnAnAtmanaH paramAtmaikatva-pratyayo vidhIyata ityavipratipattiH sarveShAmupaniShadvAdinAm. //

\[That \`All the Upanishads teach the idea of unity/identity of the Supreme Atman and the individual Atman' is an undisputed understanding of all the adherents of the Upanishads.\]

From this it is known that during Shankara's time there were no Vedantic philosophy that was not Advaitic in nature. In the bhashyas Shankara has refuted a 'bhedābhedavādin' who is also an advaitin but who admits bheda in the vyavahāra to be as real as abheda in the pāramārthika. (BSB 2.1.14). In the Ānandamayādhikaraṇam, the bhāṣya is predominantly based on the views of a 'vṛttikāra', also an advaitin, who existed prior to Shankara. 

In the Bh.Gita Bhāṣya introduction Shankara says:

तदिदं गीताशास्त्रं समस्तवेदार्थसारसङ्ग्रहभूतं दुर्विज्ञेयार्थम्, *तदर्थाविष्करणायानेकैर्विवृतपदपदार्थवाक्यार्थन्यायमपि* अत्यन्तविरुद्धानेकार्थवत्वेन लौकिकैर्गृह्यमाणमुपलभ्य अहं विवेकतोऽर्थनिर्धारणार्थं सङ्क्षेपतो विवरणं करिष्यामि ॥  

From the above it is known that many commentaries on the BG have existed prior to Shankara but not sure whether they were all 'advaitic'. From the Br.up. bhāṣya vākya cited above, it might be concluded that these were also advaitic in nature.
