It seems that the simple question on the types of advaita was over complicated. His intention was made clear in his second posting. He knows well Shankaracharya was the अद्वैतवेदान्त as it is known popularly in contrast with द्वैतसिद्धान्त of Madhvacharya. He knows विशिष्टाद्वैत of Ramanuja and wanted to know any more schools known by the advaita, like विशिष्टाद्वैत. One more I can add द्वैताद्वैत or bhedadabheda of Nimbarkacharya. The list may be added if any variety of Advaita schools of the same type by the Scholars than elaborating the history if usage of the word and etymology which only help to baffle the member and the point asked proved to be wrong by the Scholars.

I had heard long ago the differentiation between Dvaita and Advaita from my uncle only and I could not provide any source.

Profession Aklujkar has rightly grasped and listed some more names and Iyengar had added one more शुद्धाद्वैत of Vallabhacharya. Better suggestion would be to go through the History of Indian Philosophy of SD Gupta which accounts for these chronologically. Any more addition to the schools listed above is welcome.

I am not sure any History of Advaita lists these titles as variety of Advaita Vedanta, in spite of their similarly in the name. But they may be considered as independent theories like विशिष्टाद्वैत than modified Advaita being common to them s their names suggest.

The question in the second post confirms that Shankara's Advaita we modified latter on creating offshoots of Advaita and he wanted to know whether Advaita theory was present before Shankaracharya or himself the founder of the school. Pre Shankara Advaita is a topic for research wanting sufficent proof and now available complete works set by Shankaracharya in addition to Mandukya Karika by him teacher.
