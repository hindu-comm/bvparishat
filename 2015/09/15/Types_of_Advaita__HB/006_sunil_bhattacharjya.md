Yes. The Upanishads constitute the Vedanta. Lord Krishna used the word Vedanta more than 5,100 years ago. Brahmasutra / Vedantasutra has the upanishadic message in sutra form and that is why that is also a Vedantic text. Lord Krishna gave the essence of the Veadnata in the Bhagavad Gita.  
  
Lord Buddha , who came some 1,300 years after Lord Krishna, exhorted the brahmins of his time to concentrate on the essence of the Vedas, as that alone can help one to cross the cycle of birth-death-rebirth. The performance of the Vedic rituals alone would not help. I do not recall the exact reference for this. By this Lord Buddha was actually asking the brahmins to try to understand what the Vedanta teaches. May be till the time of Adi Shankaracharya's bhashya, the Bhagavad Gita was considered too unintelligible.  
  

However at no time in the ancient past there was any mention of different types of Vedanta. It is only in the last one thousand years or so that several different interpretations of the Brahmasutra and Bhagavad Gita sparng up. It could be possible that several of the later Acharyas could not comprehend Adi Shankara's bhashyas well and that is why they came out with their bhashya showing where they differed from Shankara.
