Just to add a pramāṇa to the above: In the Taittiriya Mahānārāyaṇa Upaniṣad we have the famous mantra 'न कर्मणा न प्रजया धनेन..’ which ends thus: यो वेदादौ स्वरः प्रोक्तो वेदान्ते च प्रतिष्ठितः तस्य प्रकृतिलीनस्य यः परः स महेश्वरः where both the beginning and end of the Veda is specified. Sāyana's commentary holds that the 'Om' pranava is the beginning of the Rg.Veda (agnimīḷe...' 'iṣe tvorje tvā..(yajurveda) and the 'Om' is the end syllable of the Atharva Veda Mandukya upanishad: Omityetadakṣaram idam sarvam...The Om pranava is present at the beginning and end. 

  

This was stated to show the word 'Vedanta' is present in the mantra in the sense of 'end portion of the Veda.' which is the Upanishad.
