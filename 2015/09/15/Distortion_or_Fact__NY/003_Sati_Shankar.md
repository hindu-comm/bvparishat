Manyavar

When I started approaching this field some decade ago, the most easily available books were those under Guttenburg digitization scheme... there are a lot of such books available on internet, More interesting, if we explore the websites of various US and European universities for , as I did, the study materials in this field of study, we find the similar interpretations and misrepresentation of facts.... I was surprised to see, they teach it, publish it and become professors and Authority of the subject to select, nurture and create an army of students with the same teachings, to honk over South Asian teachers...
Nothing surprising. These are the literature,sponsored by missionaries.
