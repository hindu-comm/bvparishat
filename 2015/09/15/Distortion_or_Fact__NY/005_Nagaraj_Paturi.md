Since these are not academic studies, we maybetter ignore them.



But there are two importantpoints that come out of your post and the one byVidwan Sri Sati Shankarji in this thread:



1\. This book is a concrete proof to the evangelical interest in the chronology issues of Hinduism and India.



2\. As Sati Shankarji pointed out, it is weird that such unacademic books are also made part of the academic course material in the western Universities which we respect for high degree of academic rigour.
