All these distortions are in vogue since 16th century, apparently. The book that is being discussed was written in 1820. Meanwhile, many 'clones' have been manufactured to propagate this idea since then, till the recent Wendys. Of the four 'upAyas' said in tradition, the missionary people only appropriated the 'bheda.' I agree with comments of all other scholars.
