Namaste

  

On snake- tortoise:

  

1\. The pointer by Ajit Gargeswari is in the right direction.

  

2\. Image search with terms-' images snake on tortoise' gives more details on brass images on chinese old copper handwork snake tortoise statue.

  

3\. Japanese legend : Yokai no Sekai : Genbu: Hyeonmu in korean .

This is used as a \< personality type reading \> model, similar to chinese astrology models.

  

Black tortoise is one of the four symbols of the chinese constellations.
The tortoise and snake are an entire entity: they are not separate . The symbol represents north and the winter season ( direction and season combination image) combined.

  

According to legends, there are no female tortoise; the tortoise had to mate with snake.

  

I hope this leads to further exploration of vishnu- vasudeva traditions influence on Buddhism/ saivism and Tantra travelling as a part of tantra- yoga out of sncient India.
