Thanks for sharing the Kurma Yantra picture. Does variation of Kurma Yantra have a coiled serpent on the tortoise as seen in the photograph shown by the Swami ji.? The pictures the Swami ji has shown can also be linked to the Kundalini. Depiction of kundalini as coiled serpent is quite common in iconography. Serpant is also depicted in jaina iconography.  
  

As already said turtle is scared in several cultures but serpent on tortoise back as shown in the picture is common in Chinese and Japanese art works such as fengshui in astrology etc.  

  
3. As our Indian knowledge migrated to the foreign lands in many ways through the long passage of time, this Kurma yantra also might have migrated to those places at any particular point of time.  
  

We have to first know for sure when was Kurma Yantra widely used was it was in Buddhist or Barhmanical or outside brahmanical sources. If you could please point out to any literature on Kurma Yantra it would be much appreciated.
