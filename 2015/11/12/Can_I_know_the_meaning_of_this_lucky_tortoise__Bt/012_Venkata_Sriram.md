Pujya Misra Ji and Pujya Swamiji,

  

Apart from turtle, there is a sentiment of having fish (matsya) at home. That is the reason, fish aquarium has come up that adorns the living rooms of most of the people.

  

Traditionally, at the time of construction of home, a matsya yantra is put inside and plastered. This is to ward off vastu doshas.

  

Later, in due course of time, turtles and fishes got replaced. 

  

regs,

sriram
