Respected scholars,  
  

I was shown a brass idol of tortoise with snake on its back. Probably it is called a lucky tortoise. I checked in net the meaning behind this but could not get. Though tortoise as such is used in many culture I could not find the meaning of snake on the back of tortoise. Can I get any light from any scholar in this forum?
