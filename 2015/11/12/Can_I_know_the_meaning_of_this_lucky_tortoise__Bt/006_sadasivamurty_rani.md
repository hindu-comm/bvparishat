Ajit Ji,

As there was interruption for sometime in the power supply in our are I had to post my previous mail without the Kurma Yantra picture attached to it.

I have seen Kurma Yantras of this type in dozens of shapes in many stone carvings on several Indian temples also.

I can further another snap in the afternoon from Kapila Tirtham Temple one of the ancient temples of Tirupati.

You can be pleased to see it in this mail.

Regards,



**Dr. Rani Sadasiva Murty**
