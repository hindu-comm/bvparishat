Dear Ajit Ji!

Good morning!

Here I would like to mention a few things.

1. In the source mail of this thread Swamiji said that he was shown the brass idol. But where it was shown is not specified. Hence I tried to correlate this Ancient Indian Astronomical content.

  

2. I would like to call this a mythological phenomenon than a mythological thought.

As we call the Sun as Surya according to Astronomical texts the attracting Planet of the Sun is called Pradyumna and its attracting planet is called Sankarshana. The powers of these three were named Sesha Sakthi, Kurma Sakti and Varaha Sakti. The visible Galaxy is known as Milky way. Hence if we can interrelate these astronomical features The Force of the Sun i.e. Sesha is in the control of Kurma sakti (Borne by Kurma) and that Kurma Sakti is in the control of Varaha (Kurma was borne on tusks of the Varaha along with the Bhuvanas and Sesha on its back).

  

3. As our Indian knowledge migrated to the foreign lands in many ways through the long passage of time, this Kurma yantra also might have migrated to those places at any particular point of time.

  

4. Fengshui is related to Buddhisim. So along with Buddhism this age old
thought also might have reached those places.

  

5. I have seen Kurma Yantra in this shape in many places. For instance I am giving a better version of Kurma Yantra in the attachment of this mail. Please observe in which there are : Eight Nagas (Quarterly elephants, Sesha and above them the Sumeru Sri yantra)

Power is off in our area now. I shall post it later.

  



  

REgards,
