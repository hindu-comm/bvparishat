During the same period (16th century AD) , MollaraamaayaNamu is authored by Molla, a woman-poetess in Telugu.



In the Balakandamu of this book, she describes Lakshmana as cautioning the chain of 'holders' of the earth to watch out, take care and hold each other tightly so that the earth-shaking effect created by Rama's 'breaking' of Shivadhanus was going to create.



Snake over a Tortoise is part of the chain of holders of the earth in this description.
