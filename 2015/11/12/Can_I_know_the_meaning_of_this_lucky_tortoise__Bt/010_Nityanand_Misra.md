Svami Ji,

  

I do not know the origins of the motif, but Tulasīdāsa in the *Rāmacaritamānasa* (composed between 1574 and 1576) does allude to the king of serpents, who supports the earth, resting on the shell of a tortoise. The reference is in this *Harigītikā* just before the 35^(th) *Dohā* of the *Sundarakāṇḍa* (5.35.12):  



सहि सक न भार उदार अहिपति बार बारहिं मोहई।

गह दसन पुनि पुनि कमठ पृष्ट कठोर सो किमि सोहई॥

रघुबीर रुचिर प्रयान प्रस्थिति जानि परम सुहावनी।

जनु कमठ खर्पर सर्पराज सो लिखत अबिचल पावनी॥



English translation by

Frederic Salmon Growse (1914), The Rámáyana of Tulsi Dás, Sixth edition (revised and corrected), Allahabad: Ram Narain Lal Publisher and Bookseller, p. 505:

“The huge serpent king could not support the burden; he staggered again and again, but each time saved himself by clutching in his jaws the hard shell of the tortoise; as though he had mastered the stupendous theme of Raghubir’s glorious expedition, and were inscribing it on the tortoise's back as the most imperishable material to be had.”
