Thanks for your fast aknowledgement of mail.

1\. I surely saw such variations of Kurma Yantra in many temples and else where. I have seen the idol with coiled serpent on the back of tortoise also some where. I shall try to go to that Kapila Tirtham Temple and snap the picture from its outer walls. Even inside the sanctum sanctorum there was the tortoise its back the coiled Snake over the head of which the Earth and over it the Idol of Siva. But it cannot be photographed.

So I can snap from the outside walls of the temple and present it here in the afternoon.

The main obstacle is it has been heavily raining here for the last three days due to cyclonic effect. So I shall find my convenient time to post further.

  

2\. Very interestingly Varahamihira in his Brhatsamhita compares entire Bharata Desa with Kurma and presents the geographical divisions of our country by name Kurma Vibhaga or Kurma Chakra.

  

Kurma Chakra  
  
Kurma (tortoise) Chakra is used to find the places and directions of  
malefic or benefic events with in a country. Here is an example how  
Kurma Chakra is used for the various states in India:

E: Bihar, Orissa, Bengal, Assam etc.  
S-E: Tripura, Orissa, Chattisgarh, Andhra Pradesh.  
S: Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh.
