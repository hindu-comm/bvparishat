Dear all,

I am forwarding a notification about the Workshop on Machine Translation

on behalf of Prof. Vineet Chaitanya, IIIT Hyderabad

Workshop on Machine Translation  
Language Technology Resource Centre (LTRC)  
International Institute of Information Technology (IIIT),Hyderabad

A team of linguists, computer scientists and language experts from IIIT-Hyderabad and University of Hyderabad have been working on Machine Translation systems (English – Indian languages and Indian language – Indian languages) for the past 25 years. With this effort a Language Accessor cum MT system, Anusaaraka, has been developed mainly for English – Hindi language pair whose performance is currently on par with and sometimes better than some existing free resources such as Google translator and Bing (Microsoft). The tools are developed and distributed in open source mode.

Workshop Announcement

The LTRC at IIIT in Hyderabad is organizing a workshop for developing Hindi language resources and tools for Natural Language Processing (NLP) application. There already exist many linguistic and NLP resources for English and Hindi. However these resources are not free from errors. The long term goal of the workshop is to involve participants in the effort of bootstrapping all existing resources with an aim of creating an open-source, robust and good quality English-Hindi and Indian Language-Indian Language Machine Translation (MT) system. The workshop would be conducted in two phases–the first phase will be from 15th December 2015 to 13th January 2016 which is to be followed by a second phase of roughly six months for the selected students. Two or three of the participants from the first phase will be selected for enrollment in Ph.D. in Computational Linguistics with scholarship.

Takeaways: Participants in the workshop, depending upon their interest and aptitude, will be provided with an environment to learn some of the following:

Principles and application of Information Dynamics, particularly how to apply Paninian Grammar

Some of the programming languages like Python and CLIPS

Some NLP tools and techniques

Some vital issues in Translation such as examining language divergence between source and

How to use MT tools as translation aids.

Eligibility: At least a Masters degree in any subject including Computer Science; very good in understanding English and Hindi (proficiency in speaking or writing is not a must); computer literacy; sincerity and commitment to work hard for the development of Indian languages and contribute to society in general; ability in formal analysis. concepts to other languages, especially English target language, maintaining faithfulness in translation and so on.

Fees: There will be no fees for the workshop. Expenses towards board, lodging and sleeper class train fare will be borne partially or fully (on the basis of merit and means of the participants) by the organizers for a selected few. Those interested may send their resume to reach us by e-mail latest by 30th Nov, 2015 at the following e-mail id: [so...@iiit.ac.in]()
