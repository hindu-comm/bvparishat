Namaste

Not basing strictly on shastras, I would like to touch on why it is prohibited for sAdhakas in a general manner.. (completely based on personal experience).

Human body is not just स्थूल, but it comprises of सूक्ष्म शरीर also. Every food has effect on body and mind both. It is not necessary that what is good for body, is good for mind also. And as mentioned already in another reply, those elements can easily be supplemented by intake of other foods.

  

(I myself have stopped taking it very very long back.. based on my own experience of the disturbance and turbulence both the foods cause in mind, which allowed me not to pursue my studies peacefully. Even recently when once garlic prepared medicine was given my Ayurvedic doctor, it showed negative effects upon me.. and I immediately stopped it.)

  

Spiritual साधना consists of having a peaceful, ready, sensitive, and composed mind along with generally calm inner atmosphere. In ब्रह्मचारी part of life (while carrying on with studies or leading spiritual life- seeking moksha) mind has to be maintained steadily.

The ideas in the spiritual texts are very सूक्ष्म and hence mind needs to be equally सूक्ष्म when pursuing studies of them.

Onion and garlic have very bad effect on concentration and focus.  They are notorious for their negative effect on that sensitive mind layer which connects to intellect. Even before someone comes and advises, we give it up naturally- once involved in any kind of sAdhanA.. (from simple studies to higher tapasyA).

If one is much used to them, one can slowly step by step try to give up.. *if one wants to go for sAdhana only*. Otherwise for all other people, any general rules and values followed in family or by habit are OK.

Hope this helps.
