Respected Scholars  

Namaste  

In the food habilts that we follow Onion and Garlic are strictly considered as taboo for Spiritual Sadhakas, Brahmachariṇs and for offering to God. For people who cannot omit Onion and Garlic completely, they are advised not to take in some fasting days. When this is followed for many years, there is some objection regarding that saying these two are medicines and not to be omitted completely . Some others have an opinion that Onion and Garlic entered late into the Indian Sub-continent and its effects must be analyzed scientifically.  
  

Since this has been followed traditionally, Sastras would be mentioning about this issue in one or more places. If not then what is the oldest entry about thiṣ I request the scholars of BVP to give the details they know regarding this issue.  
  

Thanking you
