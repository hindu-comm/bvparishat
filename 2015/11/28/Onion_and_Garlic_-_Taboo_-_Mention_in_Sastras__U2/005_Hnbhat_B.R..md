I think the question now was raised that of red chile and it's prohibition in Shastra-s mixing up both scientific properties and their prohibition of them in Shastra-s and scientific research emphasised for their prohibition. Just I googled and got a number of articles on the advantages and disadvantages of both on general health. Garlic is said to thwart away heart disease problems in this article and I have read this in many articles.

But it is specially noted for its pungent smell to be avoided:

किं मर्दितोऽपि कस्तूर्यां लशुनो याति सौरभम् ।

न कलञ्जं भक्षयेत्

More quotations from Ayurveda Texts and Tantric Experts are to be expected for advantages and/disadvantages could be expected.
