Dear friends,  
  

Though I am a vegetarian and refrain from onion etc on prasada preparation, I would think the  

food prohibition is an artificiality than a necessity. For Indian climate, certain foods could have  

been discovered as unhealthy and meat might have been a killer as it does in the present day.  

Eskimos have to eat meat for survival. We cannot declare that they would be less spiritual  

than someone in the plains. Personally I would think that one's mental discipline and conduct  

would help a person realize the self than food intake to nourish the body. Like a yogi, I would  

think that one must not discriminate in food and consume what's available in order to survive.  
Rama had to eat deer meat in the forest!  
  

Prohibition of onions and garlic probably came from the Jains with the thinking that these grow  

underground and the extraction kills organisms in the soil. To me the logic does not have  

much merit. A Jain family once wanted me to do their gardening because they were prohibited  

from tilling the soil! These blind beliefs have to be abandoned. But we should understand that  

consumption in excess would be unhelpful in concentration.  
  

Best regards,  

Bijoy Misra
