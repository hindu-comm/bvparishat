I understand that the Buddhist monks do not take garlic, as that causes bad body-odor, which is not desirable in any group.  
  
I understand that onions and garlic have been used in the Pakadarpanam of Nalaraja. Come to think of this, as the Yamaraja or the Dharmaraja himself taught cooking to king Nala. For a kshatriya like king Nala, the physical fitness is a must, as the kashatriya have to be ever-ready for fight at any time. That is not the case with the monks and the brahmanas, who are more into studies and a very healthy body, in fact, may be a disadvantage.
