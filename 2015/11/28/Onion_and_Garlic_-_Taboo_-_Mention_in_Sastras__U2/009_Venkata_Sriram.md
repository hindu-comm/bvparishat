Namaste,

  

In srIchakra navAvaraNa archana (as per parashurAma kalpa sUtra), the garlic is used as a substitute for matsya (fish). When one is unable to procure fish in makAra-panchaka, then one can use "lashunaM". The pramANa is shown by Sri.Umanandanatha, the chief disciple of Shri.Bhaskararaya Makhin.

  

// trutIyasya tu lavaNArdrakapiNyAkanAgaragOdhUmavikAra mAsha lashUni //

  

There are various substitutes like mixture of the paste of black salt & ginger; mAsha; garlic etc.

  

There is a mUla mantra prescribed as a japa prior to offering of these and these are "purified" (parishrutaM) and then offered to the deity. 

  

However, these aspects were widely discussed in AmnAya mutts among various Acharyas and were further refined.

  

The sadAchArIs repeatedly warned such usages and if proper prAyaschitta mantras are not chanted then pUja turn out to be rAjasik and tAmasik.

  

As one of our members explained, one should avoid onion and garlic as they generate base instincts which is detrimental in sAdhana.

  

regs,

sriram
