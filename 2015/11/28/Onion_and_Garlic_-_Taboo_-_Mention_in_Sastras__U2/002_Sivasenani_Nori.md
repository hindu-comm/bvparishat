Namaste

  

न कलञ्जं भक्षयेत् is a very old nishedhavaakya discussed in Sankaracarya's Bhashya on Bhagavadgita (13.3) and many Mimamsa (भाट्टरहस्यम् etc.) and Nyaya texts (व्युत्पत्तिवादः etc.) and is taken as Sruti. Kalañjam could mean garlic or stale meat.

  

Regarding the argument about the medicinal properties of these two, there are many food stuffs with excellent properties - for instance, meat is good for muscle, shark liver oil for hemoglobin and so on. Why, even banana peel is a very good source of B12 vitamins. If some people avoid some of these foods, those who want, could also avoid garlic and onion. There are so many sources of carbohydrates, proteins, vitamins and micronutrients that we need that one can design a balanced diet with these or other restrictions.

  

The human body seems to be remarkably resilient. Some people drink only alkaline water; some eat only proteins for a while; some only uncooked food for a while and so on (with various names being given to these diets) and yet it seems to tolerate and even thrive. So missing out on onion and garlic is not such a big thing, may be.

  

Garudapurana describes these two as nissAra:

  

``` शुद्धन्निः सारभूतांश्च वक्ष्ये शृणु खगेश्वर ॥ ३,१४.४१ cd॥

तुषा मेध्या आरनालं पुण्यकं भिः सटा तथा । उपोद्व्रजी अलाबूश्च बृहत्कोशातकी तथा ॥ ३,१४.४२ ॥

वृन्ताकं चुक्रशाकश्च बिल्वमौदुंवरं तथा । पलाञ्जुर्लशुनं वृन्तं कलञ्जं च तथा द्विजा ॥ ३,१४.४३ ॥

एतत्सर्वत्र काले च निः सारमिति कीर्तितम् । ३,१४.४४ ab॥ ```
