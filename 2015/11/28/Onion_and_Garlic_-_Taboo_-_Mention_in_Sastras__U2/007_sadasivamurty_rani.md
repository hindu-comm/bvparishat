Here two points are to be observed.

1. Eating or not eating Onion and Garlic as a part of our food ingredients. This is one aspect.

2. Using Onion and Garlic as medicines in Ayurveda. This is another aspect.

Both are two different things.

  

**I ) As a part of Food**

As a part of food both are prohibited to be eaten by

i) those who are in ritualistic practices and Yajna Diksha

  

ii) who are performing austerities and

  

iii) those who are following the principles of celibacy (and by those who are just unmarried).



iv) Sanyasins are prohibited from eating these two.

  

v)Grhasthas (House holders) also while performing Caturmasya Vrata (Chaturmasya vrata is recommended even for those who are Grhastha Asrama)

  

vi) And by those who are in the austerities of Pitru Karmas (Either during the Mrta Asaucha and Sraddha karma) also..

  

Still there is a long list by whom these should not be eaten.

These two are to be prohibited as the meat, wine. liquor etc.

  

**II) As a Medicinal mediums (Anupanas) in Ayureda**

  

Using these two as a part of Ayurvedic medicinal mediums (Anupana dravyas) is not a prohibited thing.

1\. Onion Juice is one of the best mediums (Anupana dravyas) to suddenly control Diarrhea, Cholera etc. This just one of the best uses of it. There are several other benefits of it.

  

2\. Garlic is a wonderful controller of Vatadosha prakopa. It is an excellent medium to control different bodily pains. This has a high medicinal value for the women after their early post-pregnancy days.

  

So if an Ayurvedic physician recommends he does so to take it as a part of Anupana dravyas and not as a part of regular food.

  

While our tradition prohibits Mamsabhakshana, drinking wine and liquor etc.

  

But Ayurveda recommends to take the Meat of Lion, Deer and goat and the flesh of certain birds for certain medicinal functions.

  

**(Charaka, Susruta and Vagbhata Texts can be referred to for this purpose).**

**So as along as they are taken as a part of our medicinal treatment it is not wrong.**

**While discussing the properties (Rasa, Guna, Virya, Vipaka and Prabhava) of different kinds of medicines and medicinal mediums the properties of Onion, Garlic, Meat of different animals, Wine, Liquor etc also are well described in those texts.**

  

Thirdly, even the Dharma Sastra Texts never prohibited all the people to eat these things.

As said in the previous mails depending on the individual food habits eating these things was in vogue as in case of the meat, chicken, flesh etc. by the Non-vegetarians.
