\> Can scholars share their thoughts on why such a tradition got introduced in the first place ?



 - Dr Yadu Moharir



Though this is onlypartially connected to the etymology discussion and partially not, please let me respond as follows:



1\. There was another thread initiator asking for a Vedic textual source for Diwali ( Dr Yadu did not ask for such a source here. But I am making a point of general nature connected to such issues.) The present 'Hindu' culture and its practices have their roots not only in the Vedic culture but in the folk culture(s) tthat contributed to this Vedic-folk syncretic culture being given the name 'Hindu' culture. Hence, we may not be able find answers to all the questions pertaining to 'Hindu' culture in the Vedas or Vedic texts.



2\. All practices need not have come from texts or need not have been explained by texts. Quite often practice breeds new practice, the idea behind the practice remains in the oral lore not documented, or it may even not get articulated even in the undocumented oral lore.



3\. Manycontemporary discussionson ṣōḍaśōpachāra pūjā have already explained the different upachāras in terms of the formalities of reception /hospitality to a guest. Similarities between fort and temple,rituals of deity worship and rituals of respect to kings have also been discussed. Sources of such traditions need not necessarily beeither in the Vedic or the folk cultures. But treating the deity as guest, king etc. could have come from a 'civilized'/ classical urban
ideas too.



4\. Explanation of temple structure and temple rituals in terms of Yajna śāla and Yajna rituals is also well established.



5\. Explanation of temple structure and temple rituals in terms of Yogic/tantric view of human body and Yogic/tantric meditational practices too is equally well established.



6\. Vedantic / upanishadic explanation for the puranic/ agamic rituals is also not less established.



7\. Waving or presenting a flame as an honouring ritual is found in the form of waving or holdinga kāhala (torch) also. this as a royal insigniawas a frequentdispute between the British government in India and the local kings. Such disputes were raised in the case of saintly spiritual figures honoured by people during the British period. There is acompound word mangala kāhala too.



8\. As a Yogic /tantric meditational explanation, the darkness in the garbhagr̥ha is compared to the daharākāśa,waving of flame along with the ringing of bells etc. is compared to the rapture of pleasurable experience of a sudden visual and auditory illumination ata certain peak of meditation.
