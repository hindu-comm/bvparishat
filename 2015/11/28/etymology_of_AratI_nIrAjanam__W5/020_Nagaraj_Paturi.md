Thanks Nityanandji, for this excellent piece of a poem by Jagadguruji. You brought the word hartum into the present discussion by saying:



" The first quarter of the verse has a play on the consonance of the words *ārārtikya*, *hartum* and *ārti*."



This is interesting on account of the Telugu and Kannada word hārati having 'ha' in it, and the word being phonetically close to 'harati'.



Thisresemblance is probably what is prompting those looking at this as an act of removingthe evil eye affecting the deity.



But I think those looking at the relation withārti = sorrow or har =remove are looking at it from the point of view of the sorrows of the bhaktas and their removal and not the removal of the evil eye affecting the deity.
