It is possible that “ārati” has come from “ārti” ‘affliction, woe’ (especially ‘worldly woes’). In most ārati compositions I am aware of, there is a plea to the god-head to remove the devotee’s worldly suffering or difficulty. Therefore, ārti could, in such a context, have been a shortened version of a word meaning ‘an expression/composition concerning an affliction, a plea for redress, the utterance of an ārta devotee.’ A simplified pronunciation of’ “ārti” would be ārati”.  
  
nīrājana, coming from ’nis/nir + rājana’, could have had as its basic or etymological meaning the sense ’shining out, illumination on all sides’. Such illumination is what happens when a lamp or flame is moved around the face or upper body part of an icon or person as is typical in the nīrājana action.
