Sharing some observations that may contribute to further this etymology debate on the word starting from आरति.

  

1\. The word आरति is used widely in kannada language for the '
pooja-light- service at temples'. The kannada word has a history of at least 600 years of usage in temple related pooja vocabulary. The movement of the word across south indian religious practices and traditions and languages is well known. The kannada wordआरति and telugu pronunciation हारति connote the same action and same context. The pronunciation of आ as हा, शि as सि - are known variations of specific words from Samskrit- kannada- telugu- tamil contexts. The phonemic shifts are neither rule based or generic!

  

  

2.  There are several shades and practices ofआरति in a event specific and unique way. Theआरति in pooja context is light - service which may get further qualified as कर्पूर-आरति , घृतवर्ति mangala-आरति , flour preparation basedआरति ( tambittu : a jaggery based preparation using flour), water colored yellow or red with saffron ( used in marriage and the like) etc;. In pooja context, the number of wicks used, the holder shape, the arrangement of shapes and the like are cultural specialty markers.आरति is done by men(priests) as well as Women (sumangali).

  

3\. Related Samskrit words for  
आरति- i have noticed the following sanskrit words in this conext. आरार्तिकम्, आरार्तिक्यम् , नीराजनविधि. दीपाराधना, दीपसेवा-  The practical seems to be same in all cases. The etymology and rules to explain each word may carry special shades.

  

The word \<ārātrika \> आरात्रिक - split as - ( आ- रात्रि-क ) may refer to the practice of leaving a light unextinguished/ burning continuously in presence of deity for the whole night. This is a standard Temple practice, which is being violated in two ways - no oil lamps in temples at light, citing fire- hazard reasons and economy, cheap comfort and convenience of LED or other lights technology in temple! The practice of keep unextinguished light in temples is also known as - अखण्ड- दीप - continuing the light unextinguished through out for long times like six months ( at Badarikaashram).

  

This may be connected to related concepts like: absence of light is darkness(tamas/ demons / death as absence of light and heat)-the antithesis of God as light and light- giver, custom to keep a night- lamp while sleeping ( avoiding sleeping in darkness), and the desire to have the ' small light ( pra- deepa) when universal lights of Sun- Moon are not present, the scaled down Agni.

  

4. Ascribed usage of word to Acharya Shankara is seen in Saundaryalahari- प्रदीप- ज्वालाभि: दिवसकर- नीराजनविधि:

  

5\. Etymology of word आरति- The wordआरति is symbolically explained in yoga- practice and tradition as ' a technique of meditative observation of the देवता- स्वरूप-सौम्य दर्शन- the form of God, in the semi- lit light coming from a small light with a small wick giving only light and not emitting any smoke and which uses clarified butter ( सौम्य -which gives no stress on eyes: pleasing like moon light )'; and use that vision as the basis for inner contemplation of the Form of Deity. There is aprescribed method  for this observation- toes to head, head to toes, observation of specific spots of form of divine.

  

While this may not be the reality in the mass craziness and practices of todays Hindu Mandirs to present the Gods Decoration glory in social media limelight, the ( tantra-aagama) practice still exists in some mandirs like that of Kanyakumari - where the deity is not exposed to the shine of electric light and flash of photos(?!- how come the photos of Kanyakumari floats around google images-?!). The reason for guarding deity from electric light rays(?!) exposure is attributed to Aagama Shaastras which were composed way back in a pre- electricity period and non- english speaking worshippers.

  

In this contextआरति relates to the emotion of रति- स्थायिभाव refinement to become Bhakti- or Shaanta rasa. The connection of small light ( jyoti) with divine big light, the burning of (real) camphor ( and not the market supply of petro product emitting profuse amount of carbon to choke the lungs and eyes) without leaving any residue at the end, the merging in to light without a trace behind- are some more symbolisms in circulation for aarati.

  

  

This practice is emotional refinement and ego- sublimation phase of personal pooja ( bhaava- samshuddhi: Gita 17 th chapter - 15 to 17) and tberefore, as a design, marks the end of pooja. Whether this is to be considered as \<*uparati*and*virati> is dependent on the state of mind of archaka and aaraadhaka:: the pooja performer and observer.*

  

The service ofआरति in mandirs has a different social and institutional purpose and technicality. Aarati needs combination with the bells ringing( घण्टा-नाद). The devotees acceptance ofआरति has a different purpose and technicality. First one is for the pooja- performer(archaka). Second one is for devotee(आराधक).

  

The belief that watching ( directly in person or through browsers on personal devices ) and acceptance ofआरति - as leading to आर्ति-नाशनम् - the relief from suffering and disease is devotees belief. This belief permeates the entire practice of pooja- patha-paddhati as a faith practice.

  

Many 'आरति/ jaya jagadeesha hare type / jaya deva jaya deva jaya mangala moorthe- supports this interpretation.

  

I look forward for more details from learned scholars.
