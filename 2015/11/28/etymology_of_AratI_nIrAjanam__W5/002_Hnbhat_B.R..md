Please read correctly "is said to be तद्भव " instead "is said to तद्भव" in my first post.

I remember a bhajan song "जय जय आरत राम तुम्हारे" which seems to be Hindi derivation in the same meaning as आरती, आरति, हारति, आर्ति, हार्ति is used in Kannada, Tamil or Telugu all along with of नीराजन in Sanskrit which exactly the waving light clockwise while worshipping. With Mangala, both are used for the final lighting.
