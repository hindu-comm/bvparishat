These two words used in puja rituals are interesting on account of the various etymologies provided/imagined for the word आरती.



Particularly in Telugu, the word used in the place of आरती is హారతి (hārati ).



Many linguists opined that the Telugu hārati is the hyper-standardization of आरती.



The Telugu hāratiis usually found as part of the compound mangala hārati.



Quite often the words आरती, hārati, mangala hārati etc. are used as synonymous to नीराजनम्. There are expressions such as mangala nīrājanam also.



Etymological meaningsof the words nīrājanam andāratī are obviously different. Whatever is the etymology of āratī, it can not beconnected to nih + rāj from which nīrājanam is derived. (nīrājanam is 'to highlight' ,to illuminate, to put under greater light, to show under greater light)



What is the etymology of āratī? I have a feeling that āratī is derived fromā + ram and is semantically related to words such asārāmah etc. and is meant to convey the meaning 'ritual meant to give relaxation or pleasure to the deity' .



I request scholars to share their views in this regard.
