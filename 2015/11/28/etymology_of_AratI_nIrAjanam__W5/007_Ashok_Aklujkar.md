According to the Digital Corpus of Sanskrit, one more occurrence of आरार्ति would beLiPur \[= Liṅga-purāṇa\], 2.24.33:

**ārārti-dīpādīṃś caiva**dhenu-mudrā-mudritāni kavacenāvaguṇṭhitāni ṣaṣṭhena rakṣitāni liṅge ca liṅgasyādhaḥ sādhāraṇaṃ ca darśayet //

  

The association of ārārti with dīpa and darśayet in this passage should be noted. It strengthens the possibility you raise, but I have not had time to determine the precise nature of the action spoken of in the passage beyond this.

  

But now we have before us the question of whatārārti (= āra + ārti?) means.

  

It may help if you give the exact location of the occurrence in Śaṅkara’s stotra.

  

a.a.
