Dear List  
  
Thanks for the enlightening discussion on the Term "आरती" and "नीराजनम्"  
  
Can scholars share their thoughts on why such a tradition got introduced in the first place ?  
  
Thank you all in advance  
  
Best Rgds  
  
Dr Yadu

the main pUjA.Literally it may mean  

"cessation ". Cf. uparati and  
virati.  
Arati could also be taken, if  
need be, as a prAkRtisation of ArArti,which,  
though missing in almost all Sanskrit dictionaries, is  

actually used by s'ankarain one
