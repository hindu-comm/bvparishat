Waving or rotating a flame around human individuals and animals as an evil eye removingact is prevalent even today and is considered to be a folk-practice. The reference provided by Prof. Iyengar helps to know that ithas a Vedic culture connection too.

Based on the similarities between this and the nīrājanam/ārtī, some people are interpreting nīrājanam/ārtīas a ritual meant to remove the evil eye of the deity. But the idea of 'evil eye of the deity' itselfis not tenable because the deity being affected by evil eye is a contradiction.sakalakalyāṇaguṇaghana can not be affected by evil eye.



Semiotics, as per the belief system of evil eye removal practices, is thatrotating a flame or any other object believed to be capable of collecting evil eye around an evil eye affected organism is to collect the evil power of the evil eye into itself.



Extending this semiotic logic to the rotating of flame aroundthe mūrti of, say Vishnu , the effect ofnīrājanam/ārtī should beto collect the divine power ofthe deity. Semiotics of moving palms over the flame should be that people collect the divine power from the power after the rotating act is complete.
