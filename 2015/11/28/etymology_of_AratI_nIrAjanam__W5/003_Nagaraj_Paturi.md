Thanks Dr Bhat for the detailed reference.



Many websites are linking āratī with ārātrikam only. Your reference helped me realize from where all those have come.



Yes, it must be a tadbhava only.



But the question is , is it ārātrikam \> āratī , orā + ram \> āratī ?



If it is ārātrikam \> āratī , removal of kam needs an explanation.
