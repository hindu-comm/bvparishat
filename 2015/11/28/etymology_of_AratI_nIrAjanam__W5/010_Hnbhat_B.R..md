There is no doubt as light is related to darkness and in that way नीराजन is related, but not necessarily the rite नीराजन is not specially connected with the darkness in the shrine. There is always a दीप for the purpose and नीराजन only used for lightening as part of पूजा, and धूप and दीप are parts of पञ्चोपचार पूजा and this दीप consists of waving दीप, it is not used as synonymous to दीप.
