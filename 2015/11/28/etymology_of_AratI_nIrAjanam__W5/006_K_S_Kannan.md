It is possible that "*Arati*", though remarked as a '*bhAs"A* word',

may actually be a Sanskrit word, as it marks the conclusion of the main *pUjA*.

Literally it may mean "cessation ". Cf. *uparati* and *virati.*

  

*Arati* could also be taken, if need be, as a prAkRtisation of *ArArti*,

which, though missing in almost all Sanskrit dictionaries, is actually used by s'ankara

in one of his *stotra*-s.
