In the book "Sacred Matters: Material Religion in South Asian Traditions" edited by Tracy Pintchman and Connie Dempsey, on p. 141, James McHugh discusses passages from Mitramiśra's Vīramitrodaya that use the terms ārātrika and nīrājana. I have attached this page. I think ārātrika, found in Sanskrit texts, is a better source for ārati, than ārti.
