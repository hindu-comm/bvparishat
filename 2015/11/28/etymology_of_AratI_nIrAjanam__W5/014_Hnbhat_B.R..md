नीराजन or आरती आरार्त्रिक is not used not in the first place in the rites of Puja, but as the final rite, to show the light on all the parts of the image in the temple or conceptual image outside the temple to the god represented by the image established in the temple to the devotees. Nagaraj has already suggested this.

The same idea is expressed in almost all the replies in different words. Even if there is no darkness is there outside the temple Puja is performed, the rite is performed as an important final offering among the 16 services or minimum 5 services of Puja rites or one Homa rights where fire is itself lightening by pouring ghee into fire, this rite is performed a and then also it is called नीराजन of आरती even though there is darkness to be rid away or an image to be shown, the way of waving light is the same as if there is an image to be shown having different parts to be lighted in the light of नीराजन.  

If your question is based on the scientific reason, removing darkness to highlight the different parts of the image or conceptual image, may said to be the origin of this practice in the darkness of the shrines of the temple first and accepted as part of Puja Service generally as emotional service in the Puja of any dirty performed in anywhere outside the Temple and as an auspicious act in any special act like welcoming newly wedded couples or in the beginning of kings setting on Jaitrayatra as explained in the case of Nala in नैषधीयचरित ---

प्रदक्षिणीकृत्य जयाय सृष्टया रराज नीराजनया स राजघः ॥ १.१ ॥

In the above the purpose of नीराजन is said to be to get victory during the journey जैत्रयात्रा. The same is the purpose in many occasions like marriage, Upanayana etc. many of the संस्कार-s performed to human beings called षौडशसंस्कार-s like the षोडशोपचार sixteen components in the पूजा service to a deity. It became an auspicious act in different auspicious occasions as cultural part than simply removing darkness got by etymology.

This has been pointed out in many of the replies. Please go throughout the response
