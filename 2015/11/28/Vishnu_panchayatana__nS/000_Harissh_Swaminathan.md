Namaste

  

Can anyone help me with the shloka describing the position of the devatas in vishnu panchayatana and its source ?

  

There seems to be multiple variations in the positions of the other devatas (vishnu is fixed in the centre) and I would like to see if all of these have pramaanas

  

Thanks

Harish
