Dear friends,  
  
The direction the worshipper faces is important. To my knowledge, the thumb-rule is that, in the daytime pujas, the worshipper faces the East (or the North may be the right direction for Shakti Puja, i.e. Dirga puja). In the night time puja the worshipper faces the North. The "Havana" is done facing the East. May be, the other scholars would like to add to this.  
  

Regards,
