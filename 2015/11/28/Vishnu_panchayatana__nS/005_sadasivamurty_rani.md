Sunil ji!

The rule mentioned by you with slight difference is applicable in case of Sandhya vandanam. Pratah Sandhya Vandanam and Maadhyaahnikam are performed sitting facing east and Sayam Sandhya is sitting facing West.

As far as the panchayatana puja is concerned the position of the Gods and Goddesses is stable in the puja gruha. It cannot be changed
according to day and night. This is the practice in Andhra pradesh to arrange the deities west facing in a fixed order and the worshippers sit facing them ( facing East) whether day or night.

In Tamil nadu I have seen a practice perfectly opposite to this. i.e. God's face East and worshippers west facing the gods.

I have not so keenly observed the north Indian Practices in this regard.

But one thing is sure that the panchayatana placement positions are not changed according to day and night divisions of time.

If any such practices are there anywhere i am happy to be enlightened.

Pranams
