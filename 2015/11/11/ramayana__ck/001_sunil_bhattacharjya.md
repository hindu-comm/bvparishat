Dear Sudipji,  
  

Are you sure that there are two volumes. What I could see is only as follows:  
  

Adhyatmaramayana, with commentaries of Narottama, Ramavarman and Gopala Chakravarti, ed. Nagendranath Siddhantaratna (Calcutta 1935)

  

West Bengal Govt. Libraries website is probably closed now, for including 10,000 more books. Let us hope the above book will be available when the website becomes open again.

  

Regards,
