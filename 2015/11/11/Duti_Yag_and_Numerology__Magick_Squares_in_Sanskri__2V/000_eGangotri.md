Dear All:  
  
Happy Deepavali.  
  
So we have done two manuscripts recently and the subject is rather interesting.  
  
A Balinese Shaman Friend of mine in Bali practises Angka(Anka, Number ) Meditation - and when I saw the Anka Tantra in the Catalog I was eager to have it digitized, not least so he could read it himself and see any connection. And personally I also wanted to see what light could be shed on Numerological practices in Pre-Modern India.  
  
So it can be seen here:  
<https://www.scribd.com/doc/289303338/Deepotsavakhya-Yantra-GranthaH-and-Anka-Tantra-4967-4968-Alm-22-Shlf-4-Devanagari-Tantra>  
  
Another Manuscript which I had done, only because its TItle 'Sri Vidya Nitya Paddhati' seemed we could get hold of a Second Copy of Sahib Kauls' work of the same name which up until we first made it online was never available publicly.  
  
But the manuscript turned out to have several Kali Kavachas and stotras - and with nothing related to Sahib Kaul's Text - of which Duti Yajan Vidhi seemed something which could be very meagerly documented and also eagerly sought by many people.

Page 251-269 of the manuscript describe this Vidhi.
