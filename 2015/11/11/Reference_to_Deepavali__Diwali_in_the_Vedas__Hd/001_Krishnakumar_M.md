Namaste,

  

My own understanding is that there is no scriptural basis for Deepavali at all, not withstanding the innumerable references to Narakasura Vadha and Rama's return to Ayodhya etc, in popular imagination and internet.
None of these is reliable information. Ramayana etc talk about lighting lamps to welcome, but that is hardly the Deepavali that we talk about today.

  

There are perhaps vicarious and indirect references to Deepavali in(1) Dharma Sindhu by Mahapandit Kashinatha Upadhyaya, 1790 AD (2) Nirnaya Sindhu by Shri Kamlakar Bhatta,1612 AD (3) Smriti Mukta Phalam by Sri Vaidyanatha Dikshitar. These are considered standard references today.

  

I hope some pandita who has done any serious research on the actual evolution of Deepavali can throw more light on this.

  

pranams,

  

Krishnakumar
