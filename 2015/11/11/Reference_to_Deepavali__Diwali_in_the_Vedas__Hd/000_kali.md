HariH OM!

  

vidvadbhyaḥ sarvebhyo Namaskāraḥ,

  

Dēpāvali / Diwāli grētings to all North Indian friends celebrating the function today.

  

Although we have heard / read puranic lores about Dēpāvali / Diwāli I am just curious to know

  

whether our Vedas contain any reference, direct or indirect, to Dēpāvali / Diwāli \|

  

We have read everywhere that Paramātma svarūpam is Tejomayaḥ \|

  

Can we relate this 'Tejomayaḥ' to the Dēpāvali / Diwāli constructs?

  

Are there Mantrās / rites specifically suggesting to these festivities?

  

Every Puranic lore has a basis in the veda mantras, I suppose.

  

On this Dēpāvali / Diwāli occasion I just want to learn this from the esteemed scholars on this forum.

  

DhanyavadaH

  

kalivaradhan
