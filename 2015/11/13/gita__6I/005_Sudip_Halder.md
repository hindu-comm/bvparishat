all these gitas , belonging to the mahabharata and the purana deserve attention for their philosophical content. in the mahabharata, we found various gitas like, vyadhagita(vanaparva), hamsagita(santiparvan) and also srimadbhagavadgita.tilak,vaidya say that the text of the mahabharata, including the bhagavad-gita we have it now, took shape from about the fifth to the third century b.c. most of the gitas in the puranas have been written having the bhagvadgita as their norm. as such they resemble to the bhagvadgita in their subject matter.but the gitas inthe mahabharata do not resemble to the bhagavadgita.
