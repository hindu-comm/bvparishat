Both Ganapati Muni and Chintamani Vinayak Vaidyacharya were contemporaries, close friends and exchanged ideas. Both were great literary critics. Shri Ganapati Muni writes in introduction:

  

// paridrushyamAnaM mahAbhArataM sarvaM api kriSNadvaipAyana muniH virachitavAn iti sampradAyakAnAM vishwAsaH / mUla bhArataM kiM api dvaipAyanasya, tat bahubhiramshaiH samyOjya mahAbhArataM krutaM anyaiH iti navyAH, vimarshakavara chintAmaNi vinAyaka vaidyAchAryaH prakrutaM mahAbhArata swarUpasya niSpAdayitA sautiH ugrasravA iti nirdhArayati //
