'नमोस्तु काव्यकण्ठाय मुनये तत्त्ववेदिने /

श्रीमद्गणपतिप्राह्वनिगमागमदर्शिने //

the same view as of muniji and c.v vaidya has been reflected by v.s. sukthankar in his prolegomena to the critical ed. of the mbh. at bori, pune. but as the final touch by sauti makes it s'atasaahasrii samhitaa, in between we have vais'ampaayana who has raised the extent of the epic up to about 24,000 verses.the parva-sangraha-parvan gives the details of the nos. of the mbh as embellished by sauti with addition of akhyaana-s and upaakhyaana-s.

the development of the mbh as a text has still many clues still not properly examined. one of them could be that of kavyakantha regarding karna and his valor vis-a-vis arjuna.

narration of historical event for future generations is made to afford it a national character. that's how and why a purohita of stature and knowledge was given the privilege of narrating the itihaasa to a king and his men who mattered. after all truth 'satyam' is 'sate hitam' !
