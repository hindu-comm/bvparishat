Namaste Surendra Ji,

  

Sri.Kavyakanta Ganapati Muni, one of the foremost scholars of 20th century was of the opinion that "shiva gita" was older than "bhagavat gita". He had made certain observations in his critical work on Mahabharata called "bhArata charitra sameeksha".  I have the book but certain points and observations I am unable to follow. He says that there are certain incorporation in the original MB (called jaya) and the MB what we have is not the original one.

  

Arjuna is not as valorous as is being projected in the MB. He loses the battle with Karna (as mentioned by Sri.Ganapati Muni) however it was very carefully edited later. 

  

I am not a scholar to judge but going by the observations of Ganapati Muni, the MB that has been handed over to us now, is a hotch-potch of editions and deletions.

  

regs,

sriram
