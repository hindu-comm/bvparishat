namaamsi !  
  
the balenese miniature gita has rightly been reminded of by dr  
janardana hegde. it could be an ancient version of the gita or even an  
epitome. like the mahabharata the extent of the gita also had a  
development thru time. in parvasangrahaparvan the extent of the gita  
is more than 700 verses. in kashmiri recension it's about 746 verses.  
in bhaarata samhita as it has been reconstructed the gita has about  
101 verses as i remember. thus the jaya samhitaa should have about a  
dozen verses only.  
  
swami vivekananda tells that the gita could be only 7-8 verses  
following 'klaibyaM maa sma gamaH' [etc.in](http://etc.in) the second ch.  
  
one point i would like the scholars to ponder as to the positioning of  
the gita within 25-42 chapters. if you look at what precedes and what  
follows the gita, is far from seeming as congruous.  
  
was gita outside and made an entry at a certain time in to the body of  
the mahabhaarata ? we know the enormous growth of the epic is due to  
the insertion of aakhyaana-s and upaakhyaana-s. is gita is such a  
thing ?  
  
as known by now bhagavadgiitaa is the first gita. the name 'gita' to  
take this form as a noun must have taken time.then could be that other  
gita-s came up.after all all masters that occupied the vyaasaasana are  
de facto vyaasa-s who conscienteously added and multiplied.  
  
can anyone tell me how to get a copy of the 70-verse bali's gita ?  
  
regards,  
smmishra
