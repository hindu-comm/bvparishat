I find this thread of discussions on Gita & Ganapati Muni's observations on it, utterly fascinating. I am not an expert on the topic but am looking forward to seeing more refreshing contributions from other scholars. I wonder if 'Sriram-ji' \[or, somebody else\] could make Ganapati Muni's book available on-line, for download in pdf ?
