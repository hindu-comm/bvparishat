Please read  
'It is not a Paninian word, but most probably one coined from regional language.'  
  
The word occurs in Bengali.When the peasants of Bengal were displaced after the so called ''Permanent Settlement", some of them took to highway robbery. They were called Thagis. Bankim Chandra (Anandamath) avoids the term *thagi* and portraits them as revolutionaries fighting for the motherland against the British.
