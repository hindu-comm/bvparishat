namaamsi !

  

i could not trace 'thaka' as cheat in the lexicons although we have it in regional languages. in his edition of nyaayabhuushanam svami yogindrananda at the end index gives it as thak-s'aastra and not thaka-s'aastra.(this is mostly by printing mistake.). but then at page 392 the word thaka-s'aastra comes twice.there is also no paninian root as Thak, Thaki etc.

  

bhaasarvajna, the mid-10th c. philosopher-logician was a great paas'upata and he was against certain vedic practices and texts. while holding out the veda-s as authentic god-given works, the paas'upatas had scanty regards for the outgrowth of the vedas in s'rauta-smaarta traditions.

  

i may suggest mr rafal to check out in nyaayasaarapadapancikaa a comm. on nyaayasaara but also clarifying nyaayabhuushana positions for 'Thaka-s'aastra'.

  

regards.
