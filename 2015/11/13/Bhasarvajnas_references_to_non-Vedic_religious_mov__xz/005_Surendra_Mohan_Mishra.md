thanks. as i get it the word 'Thaka' in the sense of a cheat is not known in kashmiri language. in odia language 'Thaka' is for a cheat. but wherefrom bhasarvajna could get this word and put it in to sanskrit writing. could it be of some prakrit prevalent in contemporary kashmir ? some prakrit linguist may throw light on this. regards.
