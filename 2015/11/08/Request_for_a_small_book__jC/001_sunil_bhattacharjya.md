Dear friends,  
  

The book "**Gurjardesha Rajvanshavali" by** Rangavijaya, seems to be there at

“The Lalbhai Dalpatbhai Institute of Indology”,  

Near Gujarat University  
Navrangpura

Ahmedabad

  

Hope the friends from Ahmedabad area will be able to get the information from that institute as to how to get a copy of the same.  
  

Regards,  

Sunil KB
