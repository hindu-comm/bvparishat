In my last post addressed to Prof. Kannan, kindly correct tiryacaḥ in the first sentence to tiraścaḥ.

  

if tiryañc is derived from the root añc to ‘revere, worship’ the accusative plural can be identical with the nominative plural. However, this prātipadikatiryañc will not fit the context in meaning. The context needstiryañc in the sense of‘bird’.

  

a.a.
