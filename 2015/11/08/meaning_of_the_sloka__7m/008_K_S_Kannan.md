  Perhaps we must have ***yAtAsu***

         in lieu of ***yA yAtAH***, 

(and further supply/assume*yAsu)*,

thus making it a Locative Absolute construction.

  

(This saves the need for the conversion of

some of the nominative ending words to the accusative-ending ones

and further ensures the non-violation of the metre.

Also, this leaves the verse the least disturbed).

  

Or else, we must have the *adhyAhAra*-s suggested by Prof. Murthy

(and have ***tAbhiH*** in brackets rather than ***tena*** as the referent is *giraH*).

Is my emendation okay ?

  

(In Prof. Deshpande's version, I think there is a small typo:

      हर्षॊ**ल्लस्त**कन्धरास्

should be ***llasat*)**
