respected scholars,

I can not get the translation, as well the meaning, of the second hemistich.

This stanza is Anandavardhana's one, and is taken from an anthology known as "Subhashitavali" of Vallabhadeva:

yā sādhūn iva sādhuvādamukharān, mātsaryamūkān api

proccair no kurute satāṃ matimatāṃ, dṛṣṭir na sā vāstavī \|

yā yātāḥ śrutigocaraṃ ca sahasā, harṣollasatkaṃdharās

tiryañco ’pi na muktaśaṣpakavalās, tāḥ kiṃ kavīnāṃ giraḥ \|\|
