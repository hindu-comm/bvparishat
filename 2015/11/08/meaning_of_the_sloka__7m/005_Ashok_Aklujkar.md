Dear Prof. Kannan,

  

If the emendations you propose are made, should we not have tiryacaḥ (accusative plural) in the place of tiryañcaḥ? Otherwise, the adjectives will not agree with the noun they are supposed to go with. But such a change will disturb the metre.

  

Secondly, even if we make all the changes mentioned so far, we will still need a verb meaning ‘do, make’ if the sentence is not going to remain incomplete.

  

What has happened, I think, is that we have the first half one verse and the second half of another verse combined in the available text. A haplography, probably caused by the repetition of yāh, has deprived us of the parts in between.

  

The relative frequency of verse lines beginning with yā could also have led a scribe to write the text in a corrupt/mixed way. (See the Subhāṣita anthologies that have a verse or verse line index.)

  

The first half probably belonged to some poet other than Ānanda-vardhna.

  

I cannot check at present if the second is found in some other work of Ānanda-vardhna such as the Devī-śataka.

  

अस्तु दीपावलि: शुभा ।
