Dear Marcis Gasuns!

Namaste!

I think there are two possibilities.

1. Approaching the popular sources already mentioned by the scholars in this thread such as:1. Amar Chitrakatha Series, Chandamama series, Balala Bommala katha Seiries etc.

The artists like Amar and the Chitra and Sankar of Chandamama series are no more. So if those sources are our options the existing pictures only one has to rely up on.

  

2. Getting the illustrations through living artists as per our requirement. If the second one is your option we have some excellent artists with us whose help we took in preparing Mahabharata Chitrakatha Malika for our Mahabharata Project of Rashtriya Sanskrit Vidyapeetha, Tirupati. You can go to our Website and watch the quality of the pictures. The artist who drew those pictures for us has nearly 40+ years of experience in drawing pictures for Ancient Indian Epic literature in various manners.

He can draw muliti-colour pictures or paintings, line sketches, story boards for serials in various popular TV Channels and an expert in multimedia technology also.

  

If his necessity is felt you can contact me further.

regards,



**Dr. Rani Sadasiva Murty**

Namaste,

  

 I need b/w illustrations for a Sanskrit book, different stories. A friend of mine gave me "Sahasra Siraccheda Apurva Chintamani- NagaSri- Balananda Bommala Series, Navaratna Book Centre, Vijayavada", lovely illustrations. Are there different styles available, comic like heroes for stories in Sanskrit that could be re-used?
