I read your mail.

To quote from it "The only issue, I guess, is time. Weeks or months would be required, when I have counted days. Too late I came indeed."

Even if you have a few days to count to meet your requirements I believe he can help you." First I contact him and if he is available I shall give you all his contact details. You can then associate him in your project.

I shall soon catch you with his reply,
