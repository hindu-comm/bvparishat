Thanks for the many answers! Sorry to ask about children pictures to learned men who do not deal with illustrations on a daily manner.

Yes, indeed, if I manage to find a .pdf collection online. I can remove the color after and get some really simple pictures - exactly what I need.

For now only <https://www.scribd.com/> is what I found, a few are there scattered around.

  

Old Chandamama magazine issues, Dr. K.S.Kannan, pre-2010 or pre-1950. I'm afraid I'm too young to understand where is the line.  

  

Nagaraj Paturi, yes, early modern illustration styles inherited from folk illustration styles sounds good.

  

Surendramohan Mishra, the search gives fine results as

<http://www.kashgar.com.au/site/assets/media/catalog/furniture/thumbs/ganesh_patachitra_top.jpg> - but sadly they can't be used in a book that does not has any colors. I'll use them on web, but can't in a book, sadly.
