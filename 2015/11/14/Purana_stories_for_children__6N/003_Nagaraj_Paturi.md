The drawing styles exemplified by the images shared by Dr Mārcis Gasūns belong to early modern illustration styles inherited from folk illustration styles.

  

One such style which has a vibrant centuries old tradition in Telangana is the Kakipadagala or Nakashi style used in the scroll-based folk narrative performance art forms.

  

The art form is surviving in a village called Cheryal and is now widely known after the name of the village.

  

Sharing samples.
