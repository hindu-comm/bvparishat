Your statement itself is contradictory you have to first contact the publisher and then scan a book. Your printer does not come into the picture at all. I encourage people to scan and share Sanskrit and Indological which are old hard to find or long out of print for private academic studies or articles for the purpose of criticism or research but not for a book easily available at Rs 70 printed in the year 2012 including its covers or pictures that it may contain  

Please continue the discussions just mentioned this as many have very good intentions but may not be aware of restrictions laws impose. This is not a legal advise

 or a moderator note. This is my personal view.
