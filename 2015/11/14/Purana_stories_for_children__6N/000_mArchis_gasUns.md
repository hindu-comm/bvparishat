Namaste,

  

 I need b/w illustrations for a Sanskrit book, different stories. A friend of mine gave me "Sahasra Siraccheda Apurva Chintamani- NagaSri- Balananda Bommala Series, Navaratna Book Centre, Vijayavada", lovely illustrations. Are there different styles available, comic like heroes for stories in Sanskrit that could be re-used?
