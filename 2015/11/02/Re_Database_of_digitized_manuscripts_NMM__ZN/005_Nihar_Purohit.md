Thank you Dhaval bhai!

  

Amazing site[www.sanskritworld.in](http://www.sanskritworld.in/)

Thank you so much for the devanagri unicode conversions. This is very helpful for all the pandits and scholars who are not used to transliteration. Please kindly upload the remaining texts of Kashmir Shaiva series in the same devanagri unicode fonts. It would be great to have the complete texts of both Agama and Veda. That would be such great seva for the world.

  

  

With love,
