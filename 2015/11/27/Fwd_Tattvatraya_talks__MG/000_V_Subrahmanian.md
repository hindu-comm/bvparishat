Thank you very much for arranging the video recording, processing and uploading the talks. This service to the world of śāstra studies from the Advaita Academy is to be cherished by one and all. Pl. convey my thanks to the Management of the Academy for playing a pivotal role in the dissemination of the great treasure of Bhāratīya Darśana Sampat.
