Dear Ajitji,  
  

Thank you for the mail. Any participative discuusion on this topic has to be in consonance with the ancient chronological records given in texts like the puranas and the Rajatarangin, including the astronomical data in these texts. After going through these texts Prof. Troyer vehemently opposed Prof. Max Muller, in the 19th century CE, when the latter formulated the Aryan Invasion Theory. After leaving his job in Kolkata Prof Troyer published his translation of Rajatarangini in French.  
  

Regards,
