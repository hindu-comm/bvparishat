Dear Sunil Bhattacharya, Namaste!

You are promoting your theory of Lord Buddha’s date and revised dating of the ancient Indian history. Is it not appropriate for you to produce evidence in support of your theory? To the best of my knowledge, nobody else from BVP has so far produced evidence supporting your theory. So please kindly produce evidence asked by me and by others in their BVP postings. Let me know also the date of Chandragupta Mourya according to your dating system.Thanks. NRJOSHI

Vidvana N.R.Joshi, Namaste  
  

Kindly note that I never claimed that Ashoka Maurya lived in the 18th century BCE. I said that Lord Buddha lived in the 19th century BCE and he passed away towards the end of the 19th century BCE. Ashoka Maurya lived about three centuries after the demise of Lord Buddha.  
  

Several puranas have given the details of the names of the dynasties and kings from Ashka Maurya onwards to the Gupta kings.. Why not have a look at these in any of the puranas yourself? The western scholars who, till the end of the 19th century thought the world to have been created around 4004 BCE, found it difficult to accept the pauranic timelines, but an Indian should not have any such problem with the Pauranic timelines. If you cannot locate the dynasties and the kings in the puranas, please do not hesitate to tell me.
