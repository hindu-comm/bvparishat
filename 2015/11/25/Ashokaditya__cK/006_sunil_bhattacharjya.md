Dear N.R.Joshi, Namaste,  
  
1)  

It seems that so far you have not read my paper on "Dotted Record", which I sent to the BVP, sometime ago. In that paper I debunked the 5th-6th century date of Lord Buddha, which was arrived by the adherents of the Aryan Invasion Theory, primarily through their dependence on the
faulty interpretation of the Dotted record.  
  

Further, if you are genuinely interested in ancient Indian chronology, please read the Rajatarangini. It clearly gives the time of Kanishka around the 13th century BCE. Kanishka lived about 500 years after Lord Buddha. This also agrees with the time of the demise of Lord Buddha towards the end of the 19th century BCE.  
  
In case you have cogent evidence in favour of the 5th-6th century date of Lord Buddha, you are free to share that in BVP group and you need not accept my views.  

  
2)  

It seems you have not yet read my earlier mail, where I already pointed out that the polity in Megasthenes's account and in the Arthashastra of Kautilya.are different. This was studied in detail by professor Shrirama Goyala. Chandragupta Maurya could not have been there in the times of Alexander the Great.  
  

It seems you are reluctant to read the pauranic chronology. May I know why do you hesitate to read the pauranic chronology?  
  

Thanks,  

S.K.Bhattacharjya
