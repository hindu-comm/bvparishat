Namaste,  
  

Gautama Buddha never said that he did not believe in the Veda. He was against animal sacrifice and that was what he told king Bimbisara, who was performing a yajna. He asked the brahmins of his time whether the vedic rites would help one to cross the cycle of birth and death, and the brahmins did not have an answer. That obviously prompted him to asked the brahmins to concentrate on the essence of the veda (by which he obviously meant the Upanishadas). The Mundaka upanishad as well as the Bhagavad Gita tell us that the Veda is apara-vidya and the Upanishad is para-vidya. Being a kshatriya prince he had access to Veda and Upanishad, but he had to abide by the restriction that the brahmins alone were authorised to teach the Vedas. Lord Buddha was a born Hindu, and died a Hindu. He learnt Sankhya and Yoga and he did not believe in plurality of the souls and his thoughts were akin to the Vedantic thoughts, that one has to vacate the five koshas and realize the universal unity. Unfortunately he has been misjudged by many as anti-vedic and as preaching Nihilism, ignoring completely that he was a great reformer. Lord Mahavira was also a Kshatriya prince and he was a born Hindu and died a Hindu. He also studied the Sankhya and Yoga and practised that and attaining Kaivalya was the objective. Because of his preaching highest austerity the Jains appeared to be much different from the mainstream Hinduism, so much so that his austerity was much beyond that of Bhagavan Parshvanath also and there was a time (after the demise of Lord Mahavira) that the two sects of Jainism had to iron out their differences, under the leadership of Gautama Indrabhuti and Keshi

  
As regards vegetarianism, we should accept what the history tells us. Lord Rama did take meat and that was expected of a kshatriya, for whom the hunting was a sport. That was rightly so. If the kshatriya hesitates to kill an animal for food how would he face an enemy, who is out to kill him.The kshatriyas also may have to survive and find food even in a jungle, even if it meant killing an animal for food, if the war conditions need him to do that. It is said that Hitler hesitated to help Netaji, saying that you Indians cannot kill a fly and how are you going to fight the British. This statement of Hitler may or may not be a fact, but the Kshatriyas did kill animals and take meat. Lord Buddha told the monks to accept meat, provided the animal is not sacrificed specifically for the monk and the monk did not see the killing or hear the animal's cry while being killed. The Bhagavati sutra seems to say that the Jains also took meat at one time, though the present day Jains do not accept that. For the Hindus, Manu advised not to take meat of domesticated pigs and fowl and later on another restriction came and that forbid the Hindus from taking beef in the Kali yuga. But the fact remains that Manu did say that it is better not to take nonvegetarian food, as it could attract the unwelcome retribution for that karma.
