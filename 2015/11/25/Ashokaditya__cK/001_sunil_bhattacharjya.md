Dear friends,  
  
Shri Khokraji has to look at the Pauranic time line as well as the astronomical studies, which show that Lord Buddha.lived till the end of the 19th century BCE and Ashoka Maurya lived about 300 years after demise of Lord Buddha. Is it not obvious that Ashoka maurya could not have sent emissaries to Antiochus, the successor of Selecus.in the 3rd century BCE ?
