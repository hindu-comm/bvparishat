namaamsi.

  

our knowledge is limited to gautama buddha n the later ones, but little do we know of the former buddhas. accepting buddha as vishnu's avataara could be n surely is an adjustment for social amity. the last two verses of ch 10 of the gita tell us that the best as also as anything in general is an incarnation ! but as i contemplate i feel sure that the buddha, n so also mahaaviira has a lot of ideas from s'aivism n kapila's saankhya. ashvaghosha in his buddhacarita speaks of the later. vaishnavism is a modified form of s'aivism. s'aivism n it's offshoot s'aaktism believed in non-vegetarianism n vaishnavism was vegetarian in practice.

  

the sankhyaaites n later jainas could have inspired n exerted influence on the s'aivites n s'aaktaites in this respect. in ld instt, ahmd, once the prof b bhat read a paper telling from jaina aagama-s that the jaina bhikshu-s earl;ier took non-veg food as alms, but later left it.

  

chronology is our moot point. difficult to exactly arrive at. one friend suggested the puranic sense of time as helpful. i do believe so. our study of shastras n leaving out the puraana-s in historical perspective is perilous. after all it's puraanas like vishnu. nrisingha,harivams'a,bhagavata n mahabhaarata that lead dr s r rao to excavate dwarka !

  

the late prof a l thakur was researching in to the relation of early sankhya n jainas. some one can shed light on this in this respect.
