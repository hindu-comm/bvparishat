Dear Shri Joshi,  
  
1)  

It is a pity that you have not cared to read the pauranic chronology. Even if you don't care to read the ancient Indian history, at least you should have cared to read the history of Persia, to find the historical fact that Seleucus had a peace treaty with Sandrocottus and ceded the Greek possession upto Hindu Kush in exchange for 500 elephants and large sums of money, and he even gave his daughter in marriage to Sandrocottus. Had you read the Pauranic chronology you would have known that Sandrocottus was none other than Chandragupta of the Gupta dynastyP  
2) &  
3)  

You are making a lot of unsubstantiated assertions. I am sure the moderatorji will not like to see me giving Internet coaching on ancient Indian History in his group.  

4)  

Rajatarangini is a good text, so also there are many other ancient texts that one has to read to have a fair idea on the ancient Indian history and one has also to do one's own research  
5)  

I will leave the mud-tablets to you, as my hands are full with the
ancient texts on Indian History and also including some texts of the ancient Persian History.  
6)  

Nice to hear that you do not believe in Aryan Invasion Theory (AIT). Those promoting the fake AIT and the AMT (the Aryan Migration Theory) have done great harm to Indian history.  

I don't think your way of attempt to learn by the way of making assertions and expecting others to challenge your assertions will be of any benefit to you.  
  

Sincerely,  

S.K.Bhattacharjya
