Vidvana N.R.Joshi, Namaste  
  

Kindly note that I never claimed that Ashoka Maurya lived in the 18th century BCE. I said that Lord Buddha lived in the 19th century BCE and he passed away towards the end of the 19th century BCE. Ashoka Maurya lived about three centuries after the demise of Lord Buddha.  
  

Several puranas have given the details of the names of the dynasties and kings from Ashka Maurya onwards to the Gupta kings.. Why not have a look at these in any of the puranas yourself? The western scholars who, till the end of the 19th century thought the world to have been created around 4004 BCE, found it difficult to accept the pauranic timelines, but an Indian should not have any such problem with the Pauranic timelines. If you cannot locate the dynasties and the kings in the puranas, please do not hesitate to tell me.
