Dear Shree Sunil Bhattacharya, Namaste!

 I am trying to learn from you so that I could correct myself in my understanding of the ancient history of India. Here I am asking few simple questions.



\(1\) Please give me the name of the Indian king (and the year) who with his huge army entered Afghanistan to liberate it from greek general Selucus Nicator. This happened after Alexander return from hisfight with king Porus of northwest region of India.



\(2\) Kanishka was king of Kushanas (Yue chi tribe). There were no Shakas in India before Alexander. Shaka satrap Rudradaman (150 AD) had his inscription in Sanskrit found and confirmed. Patanjali referred to Shakas advancing towards Mathura in his Mahabhashya. Shakas were pushed down from their ancestral home in northwest Afghanistan by the Kushanas (Yue chi tribe). Shakas first ran to Persia whichoffered them place in Afghanistan area later came to be known as Shakasthan-Sigistan.



\(3\) Movement of Alexander, Shakas, Kushanas are first experienced by kingdoms from Afghanistan and east Persia

.

\(4\) Whatever Rajatarangini says, do you believe that Kanshka was around 13 century BCE ? If yes then you might have worked out timings of movement of Shakas, Kushanas, Alexander, Indian king entering Afghanistan and of other incidents of that era.



\(5\) From 14000 and 18000 written mud tablets discovered and deciphered
in the middle east countries, timing of all middle east empires are confirmed.



(6)My questions have no bearing on the Aryan invasion theory of Max Muller or others. I do not believe Aryan invasion theory because I studied the ancient history of all countries west of Indian continent to explore the original home of Aryans. I am only interested to know your own views and understanding of the above incidents listed by me. Thanks. N.R.Joshi
