Resp. Scholars, I have come across a theory that the word Buddha as an incarnat was prevalent or in vogue even before the birth of Buddha, the founder of present Buddhism. There have been presented certain evidences also in this regard. The scholars may think over the veracity or tenablity of such theory also. Best regards,
