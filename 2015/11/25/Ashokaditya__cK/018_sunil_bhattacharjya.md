Dear Shri Shankarji,  
  

You are right. Buddha is one, who has the Knowledge of Sankhya (i.e., knows the Maya or Prakriti) and is free from bondage. Buddhism believes in 24 Buddhas including Gautama Buddha and the Hindus also believe in the 24 avataras of Lord Vishnu, out of which 10 are major avataras, including Lord Ram, Krishna and Buddha. In the Dashrataha jataka, Lord Buddha says that he was Lord Ram, in an earlier birth.  
  

Regards,
