Thank you Anjali, this is a fantastic as well as intriguing book for me. I have had few of these experiences and we all must be thankful that such a account has come out and those who have experienced can clearly say that it is an authentic account.  
  

Another important aspect that i found in this book is the scriptural references regarding Kundalini and the different chakras and many other scriptural references. This makes this text even more interesting as we go back to these scriptures with a new understanding.  
  

So for me this is definitely fulfilling as well as enriching self autobiography and as i read it i can say that this is no fantasy.  
  
Those who study the scriptures must also delve deeper into the experience that these scriptures are talking about as only then one can truly understand the complete import of the subject. This is what my teacher who was a direct disciple/student of Mahaamahopaadhyaaya Gopinath Kaviraj taught me.  
  

Such books must be collected and cherished.  
  

Thank you once again!  

  

With love,
