Respected Sir,  
  
Namaskar.  
  
One of my known person is doing research on mantras, homa, articles used during ahuti and its significance etc. Now, he wants to confirm will there be Maadiphalam, Dalimbe, and muttidaremuni plants offered as ahuti on each adhyaya during Shatachandi Homa.  
  
Sir, if you have any information regarding the above, can you confirm it please.  
  
With Pranam,  
  
V. Ramadevi.
