Dear All:  
  
Sahitya Lovers will be delighted.  
  
There is this Sanskrit Novel Tarka Kutuhula - and we all know the paucity of Prose Novels in Sanskrit Literature - that had been noted by Stein in his Catalog as following:  
  
The name of this work which is a novel and should accordingly have been entered

in Class xii., jg very doubtful. It is written on the back of the first leaf by a different

hand; the letters (fo \~o are found on the margin of the leaves. The MS. is written in

a modern Kashmirian hand; it shows no signs of having been copied from a. S'arada

original.

  
It would be interesting to know if the Author is Jain as I understand Suri is a Common Jain Last Name but theWork begins with Om Ganeshaya Namah instead of a Jain invocation.

I wonder if this is a Tantric Work.
