A confusion seems to have arisen some decades ago (e.g., in A.L. Basham’s essay in Sources of the Indian Tradition) because Mallinātha is the name of the 19th Tirthankar in the Jaina tradition. No inclination toward Jainism can be detected in any of the works that go under the name of Mallinātha, the commentator of the five mahākāvyas of classical Sanskrit. His maṅgala verses indicate him to be a Śaiva.
