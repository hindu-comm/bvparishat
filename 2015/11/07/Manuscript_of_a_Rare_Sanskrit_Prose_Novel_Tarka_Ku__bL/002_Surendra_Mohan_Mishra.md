namo vidvadbhyah !  
  
Dear Dr Jha,  
  
But Mallinath was a Jaina as I remember. Of course "sUri "means a  
scholar, e.g. "pUrvasUrayah "in Raghu. It ought to be known as to  
since when this has been used as a honorific surname or title in the  
Jaina tradition of scholarship.  
  
Warm regards,  
SMMishra
