Namaste,

  

mantra Eva puSpaM / mantra rUpa puSpaM / mantrashcha asau puSpaM -

  

The mantra itself is the flower. 

  

If one observes the madhu vidyA of chAndogya upanishad, it has been mentioned that 4 vEdAs are the 4 pushpAs viz.,

  

rg vEda Eva pushpaM \| tAm amrutA ApaH \| .........yajurvEda Eva pushpaM \|.......sAma vEda Eva pushpaM \|

atharva vEda Eva pushpaM \| ....

  

In madhu vidyA, the Aditya is considered as the madhu (honey); dyu loka is the beehive. In that beehive, the honey is Aditya. The rg veda is the pushpa in the Eastern region; the rg mantra bhAga are the bees. Similarly, yajurveda, sAmavEda and atharvavEda are the pushpAs in South, West and North regions respectively.

  

Apart from this, there is a 5th pushpa that presides the Urdhwa tattva. The upanishad vAkyAs and vEdAnta are the honey bees. This 5th pushpa is in the form of praNava.

  

So, the chaturvEdAs and praNava are the form of pushpa (sumanas). The mantras are the bees. Just as the honey bees collect the honey from flower and store in the beehive (that becomes madhu), the mantra bhAga (bees) collect the honey from vEda (pushpa) and hold the Aditya (madhu) in the Akasha (beehive).

  

That honey (madhu - Aditya) nourish the universe in all 4 directions with the help of sUrya rashmis / mayUkhAs, thereby, nourishes the jagat-pushpa. This is "agni-shOmiya" tattva rahasya.

  

So, at the end of the worship, while offering the mantra-pushpa, this entire concept should be contemplated in such a way that our upAsya dEvata is that madhu tattva that nourishes us and our universe.

  

namAmi vEda mAtaraM...
