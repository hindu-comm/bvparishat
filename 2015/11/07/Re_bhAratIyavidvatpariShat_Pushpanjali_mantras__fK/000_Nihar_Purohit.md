Dear Scholars,  

Greetings from Kashi!  
  

I would like to know the significance of ' mantra pushpaanjali' that we have at the end of homas and yajyas.  

I have heard these mantras as a form of gayatris for different devatas.  
  

I would like to know the intention and purpose of chanting these mantras at the end of homa and yajya.  

Thank you!  

  

With love,  
Nihar Purohit
