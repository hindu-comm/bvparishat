Thank you Sriramji. I am really thankful to you for providing an insightful understanding of mantrapushpam. I feel this is how the vedas must be studied. Can you please tell me about your tradition where you acquired this understanding. I would love to know about your guruji. If this is out of context in this thread we can converse via personal email.
