Sir,  
Thanks for your reply. This much clear 'Sir' is a knighted title. How a person in Lok sabha, Rajya Sabha Civil or Armed Service officer is addressed is a covention convention of Britishers we follow. The British House of Elders is called House of Lords. A Lord is addressed as Sir. I don't think they address everyone as Sir or Madam as we do in India. The 'Sir Sir' culture which is typically Indian. In India we have Dr. prefixed to every doctors name. No where in the world one sees such prefixes behind a doctors name unless he is a doctorate degree holder. Don't Indian children call every passer by as Uncle or Aunt though they are not related to them? Pandit or Vidvan is title given to scholars but in day to day usage don't we call anyone who knows Sanskrit as Vidvamsare or Panditare in Kannada. What I said is similar. I have also said there is a difference between day to day common usage which may not be correct technically or people who know better don't make such usages.  
  

Regards
