Respected Vidwans,

  

Thank you so much for the replies. Basically my question is from this perspective (mainly from Advaitic traditions and not Vaishnavite):

  

I have come across some (at least two to be precise) who have became
"brahmacharis" in some order and subsequently left the order and started on their own schools. But they have not formally taken sannysa diksha from any order. Yet, they are addressed as Swami Xxxxx (do not want to disclose the names) by many followers and even in their own websites.

  

I have also heard that Sannyasa has even legal connotations in India, in that a Sannyasi is legally dead to their Purvasrama and any of their properties in Sannyas asrama will go only to the organization that they leave behind and not their blood relatives, of Purvasrama.

  

So, IMHO, it is better to all such people Brahmachari Xxxx, rather than Swami Xxxxx. Is this correct?

  

The allusion to "Sir" is also quite valid, in the sense that someone who is not knighted can certainly not be called as "Sir Xxxxxx."  To address someone as "Swami Xxxxx", I feel that he needs to take Sannyasa Diksha. This is not connected to calling someone as Swami, in the sense of a Master (like calling someone sir) My understanding is that Sannyasa Diksha has very serious connotations and significance spiritually and even legally.

  

Pranams,

  

Krishna Kumar
