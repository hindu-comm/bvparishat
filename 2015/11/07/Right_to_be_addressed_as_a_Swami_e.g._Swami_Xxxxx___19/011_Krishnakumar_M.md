Namaste!

  

It is clear that Swami does mean a master and even used by wives to refer to their husbands, at least in literature :), and also in cases of very high respect.

  

But, my question was slightly different. **Usage of Swami as a prefix title for names, like Swami \<something>Ananda etc.** This is quite a different situation from that of a Master, and almost always used only for sannyasins. Here it indicates that the world has been renounced and implies the the fourth Ashrama. 

  

Though Gita (sloka 6.2, etc etc) and other Shastras have given the implication of what Sannyasa is from a spirituo-logical perspective, that is more from a psychological plane and is one of attitude. The act of sannysa diksha is formalising that attitude into one's life from all planes.

  

It is also known that Rajaneesh (Osho) used to give this title to many of his followers quite easily. But in most established schools (like say RK Mission) getting sannyasa diksha is a long and arduous process and given only after a long period of tests to ensure that it is not a case of ephemeral vairagya and ward of such cases off. 

  

pranams,
