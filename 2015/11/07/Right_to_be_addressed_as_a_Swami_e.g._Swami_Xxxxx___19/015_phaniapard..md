Sir,

  

My submission is that calling people Sir in some contexts is not a convention bur a formal correct way of addressing. This is the meaning given in Oxford dictionary of english:

I quote:

## "sir /sə:/ (also Sir)

▶ noun used as a polite or respectful way of addressing a man, especially one in a position of authority: excuse me, sir.

• used to address a man at the beginning of a formal or business letter: Dear Sir .

• used as a title before the forename of a knight or baronet.

• another expression for siree"

  

As you kindly see, addressing a knighted person as sir something is but one of the usages of the word and not the only usage.Even there it is Sir John etc and not Sir alone.

Sir is a formal address and not similar to Uncle, aunt etc.  

In the house of Lords, the members are not addressed as Sir bur as Lord something or Your lordship by the staff.

Lord wellington etc.

Re.physicians, what you say is true except for an MD. He is also a Doctor of Medicine.

  

This info is for the limited purpose of contributing my bit to clarifying the correct usage of "sir" and not not at all about Swami or Pandit etc.

I write this so we have clarity.

Thanks.
