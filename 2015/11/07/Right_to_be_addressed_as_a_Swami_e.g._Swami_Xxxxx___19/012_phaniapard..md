Namaste.I don't think there is any such rule. Take the british native usage for instance. A member of a hierarchy (civil service,armed forces) addresses his superior "Sir". In the Lok Sabha, when the speaker is addressed in English, he is addressed "Mr.Speaker Sir".

In societal relationships, they add Mr.Mr, Mrs etc. A domestic servant would address his employer as Mr. so and so and not as sir.

However, when one is knighted "sir" is added to his name. When addressing such a person, Sir+first name is the form of address.

Eg: Sir John for Sir John Simon and not Sir Simon. In case of peerage it is different.Lord+second name. Lord Simon rather than Lord John.
