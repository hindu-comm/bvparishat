The issue Vidwan Krishnakumar has been raising is , for some reason, missing the attention of responding scholars repeatedly.



He is drawing attention to cases of names like 'Swami Vivekananda' being used by persons who have not taken Sannyasa.



This is a valid question only.



But unfortunately, there is no governmental body or a religiousbodywhose orders can stop people from using such misleading names for themselves.
