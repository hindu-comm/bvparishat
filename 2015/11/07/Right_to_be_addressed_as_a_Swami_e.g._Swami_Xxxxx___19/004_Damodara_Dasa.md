Hare Krishna.  
  
Svami basically means master (see monier williams - svAmin). A person  
who is considered as master can be addressed as svami - for instance a  
wife would address her husband as swami, etc.  
  
Technically Sannyasi is addressed as Gosvami - meaning master of the  
senses. Swami can also be address of Sannyasi as in varnasrama one who  
is (master of senses) Sannyasi is master of all varnas and asramas.  
  
If seen from the definition of Gosvami (as master of senses) a  
grhastha can also be considered as Swami if he has complete control  
over his senses - sa sannyasi ca yogi ca na niragni na ca akriyah  
(Gita).  
  
Usually when a Sannyasi is referred to as swami it means that we are  
considering him as Goswami.  
  
Thankyou,
