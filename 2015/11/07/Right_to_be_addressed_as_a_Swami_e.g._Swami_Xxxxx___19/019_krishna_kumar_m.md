Greetings & Namaste!

  

Let's simplify the question:

  

One can be called as Sir \<so & so \> only after knighthood. One can only called as Bharata Ratna / PadmaVibhushan / PadmaBhushan / PadmaShri (so & so> after being bestowed the honour formally (though GOI, does not officially agree to this practise, it is widely prevalent).

  

Similarly,

1.  Can I self declare myself as Swami Krishnakumar publicly without any
    requirement? (disclaimer: this is just an example and I have no
    intentions of doing so). Is not doing so a case of malfeasance,
    meant to mislead others? 2.  Do public have a right to expect someone who calls himself as a
    Swami to be a Sannyasi? 
3.  Does Sannysa have any formal requirements according to our Sastras?
    (many advaitic schools have elaborate requirements, rites and
    systems in place to give sannyasa diksha).  

BTW, Hindu Law apparently recognizes the concept of civil death, while one is alive, by accepting sannyas. Please see the Supreme Court verdict details given here:<http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-sanyas-is-civil-death-under-indian-law-1263618> and many others. So after sannyas, one is no longer the person before sannyas, legally.  

  

My feeling is that, to say that one is a sannyasi is not just as simple as saying that I have mentally renounced everything and hence a Sannyasi.



pranams,
