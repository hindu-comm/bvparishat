The questions 1 2 & 3 are best answered by scholars who have complete legal and shastric knowledge on the question raised. This my attempt to answer the three questions raised.  
  
I don't think any provision of law accepts Sanyasi as different person and treats him in a different way than they would treat a not a snayasi. A sanyasi if proved guilty faces the same punishment as a non sanyasi on any offense.  
  

Hindu personal laws may have different applicability as Dr. Krishna Kumar has rightly pointed out  
  

To answer question one there are Snayasis of different orders it depends on which order of Sanyasatva one has taken. Answer to question two, all Sanyasis are not Swamis and all Swamis are not Sanyasis. A Swami can be a popular Sir Name. Swami is also used in the sense owner the way a servant addresses his master. A Bhakta will address his God as Swami and God is not a Sanyasi. Question three is answered by my reply to question one.  
  

One can mentally renounce and become a Sanyasi which shastra prevents one from doing so. If only he needs social institutions like Ashrama and peetha he or she needs to renounce the way prescribed which varies between different mutts an undergo all the rituals and formalities
