suprabhaatam !  
  
my observation on 'svaamin':  
  
1. along with the panini's 'svaaminnais'varye' his 'aryah  
svaami-vais'yayoh' also should be cited. thus 'svaamin' means a master  
and a third-caste who owns wealth. the words 'saai' 'saain', swain( a  
derivative from 'svaamin' used as a surname for agriculturists and  
land-owners in odisha) are all 'svaamin-s'.  
  
2. 'gosvaamin' as i was told denotes such people who owned families  
whereas they continued to dwell in a mutt or temple managing the  
affairs.etymologically 'gavaam indriyaanaam adhishthaataa=niyantaa  
etc. fine.  
  
3. 'sir' seems to be from 's'riiman' and not from 'svaamin'.  
  
4. 'sva-svaami-sambandha' suggests that possessor of anything is a  
'svaamin'.to master is to possess and have an exclusive right to  
something.  
  
5. a husband is 'svaamin' to a wife and a wife is 'griha-svaaminii' in  
turn. a 'svaadhiina-vallabhaa' may be seen as a 'svaaminii' to a  
'svaamin' !  
  
6. In s'ankara tradition earlier women were not ordained in to  
sannyaasa, but of recently we can come across sannyaasinii-s bearing a  
prefix 'svaaminii'.  
  
7. 'sarvo mamaayam vibhavah !' - for god all is his  
vibhava=ais'varya=svam, thus making god the  
nimittopaadaanobhaya-kaarana of the manifest reality, hence rani  
sadashiva murthy's s'riivenkates'a as 'svaamin' is the best allusion.  
  
8. amara does not mention kumaara as svaamin, the denotation could be  
later, mostly in south india where kumaara was raised to the highest  
position among divinities.  
  
regards.
