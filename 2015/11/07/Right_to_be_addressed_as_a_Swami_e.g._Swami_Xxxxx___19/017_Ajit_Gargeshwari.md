Dear Phaniapard Sir,  

I am having finger pain today. I have clarified what I intended to convey. Prof Paturi has answered and clarified the doubt raised by Vidwan Krishnakumar.  
  

One may follow conventions or what one prefers to call. Respect it reflected in the tone ones voice in a face to face to face conversation and while writing the conventions are well established. US has abolished all titles in their constitution. Sir if used to an American means you are keeping him at a distance. If Swami is used as title it has to be used with caution but for many their Sir name itself is Swamy that's a different issue I have not seen a prejudiced discussion so far on this thread.
