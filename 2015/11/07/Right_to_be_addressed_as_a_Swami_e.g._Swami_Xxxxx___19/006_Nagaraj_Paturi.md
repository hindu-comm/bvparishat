I do not know whether Vidwan Krishnakumar is talking of a comparable situation or not.



In Telugu, they use the word Aachaarya in the place of the English title word Professor, putting itas a 'prefix' to the name.



Not related to this, as is in other parts of India, in Telugu too, words such as aachaari, aachaarya, aachaaryulu, chaarimake the end part of personal names.



Some people, with such name ends, at a certain stageof their life,popularized their names with the reverse order of words, by putting theend part of their name as the first part of their name, in the form of Aachaarya irrespective of what the form of the end part (aachaari, aachaarya, aachaaryulu or chaari)was before that.



People looked at this as an imitation ofTeluguversions of names with the title of Professor.



Similarly, if a person with Swami as the end part of his name could have reversed the order of words in the name,making his name begin with the word Swami. Whether there is an intention of making it look like the name of a Sannyasi or not is a different question. Intended or unintended, such a name gives the impression of a name of a Sannyasi.
