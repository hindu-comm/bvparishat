namaamsi ! the concept of moksha is certainly eluding ! there is a passage in karpuuraadistotra ascribed to vis'vasaara tantra: ciram jiivanmuktah sa bhavati ca bhaktah pratijanum / is there any clue or example to show that such a position is technically possible in advaita vedanta ? i shall be grateful for a thoughtful answer. regards.
