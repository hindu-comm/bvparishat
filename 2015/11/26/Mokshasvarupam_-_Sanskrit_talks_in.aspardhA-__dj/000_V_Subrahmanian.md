Namaste

  

On the 24th Nov. 2015, there was a State level 'Spardhā' organized at the Purnaprajna Samshodhana Mandiram premises. A number of participants had come to take part in several competitions, to be selected for the finals that will be a future event.

  

I had the fine opportunity and a delectable experience to hear four talks by PhD level scholars on the topic of 'Mokṣasvarūpam'. The talks delivered were from the Nyaya, Purvamimamsa and Vedanta views. 

  

Sri Sirnidhi Pyāti, a scholar/teacher at the Vidyapīṭha spoke on the topic from the Advaita Vedanta angle. He was declared the best speaker.

  

Sri Shambhunatha Sharma, a research scholar in Vyakarana, spoke on the topic from the Advaita vedanta angle. He was the second in the selection.

  

Sri...Bhatta, from RSS, Sringeri, spoke from the Purvamimamsa angle. He was the third in the selection.

  

A female scholar from RSS Sringeri spoke from the Nyaya angle and this too was a fine, very informative, talk. Unfortunately I had not recorded her speech. It was only after her talk, which was the first in order, that I thought of recording the talks. Hence I have three recordings which I am presenting here for scholars to enjoy and get greatly informed by the really scholarly talks on the topic.

  

I would like to add that Vidvan Srinidhi Pyati, though from the Madhva following, had bagged the first prize a few years ago in the RSS Shalaka pariksha on the Vivekachudamani, a well known work on Advaita. He can be called an expert on that text. In his present talk he has largely quoted from that text. 

  

The talks can be downloaded/heard from here:
