The lovers of own language are contributing there to provide people free knowledge. The basic thought of wikipedia is provide knowledge through your loved language and

**spread your language though the knowledge. Here I want to say that Sanskrit has very vast knowledge, but few people are understanding Sanskrit very well. If we provide knowledge**

**via Sanskrit, than more and more people will be learn, speak and write in Sanskrit. [sa.wikipedia.org](http://sa.wikipedia.org) is the platform only to full fill this goal. **

**Please see my articles which I can't say all are mine. But I am happy to boot my Sanskrit Language.**
