While looking at the meaning of the word 'ibid', seen in many texts, given as:

  

Ibid. (Latin, short for **ibidem**,meaning"in the same place") - a thought occurs to me that in Malayalam there is the word/usage: 'iviḍe'
ഇവിഡെ which means: here, in this place, अत्र. 

  

Could it be a 'va' transformation / alternation of 'ba'?
