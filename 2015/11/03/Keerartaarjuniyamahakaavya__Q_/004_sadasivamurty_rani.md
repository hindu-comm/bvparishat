Dear Shiva Kumar Bhat!

If your question is about the persons either working or worked in past on "Vyakarana related Topics in Kiratarjuniya of Bharavi here is a piece of information for you.

  

One, **Dr. (Mrs) K. Sujani**, has been working under my guidance on the Topic - **"Electronic Tinganta Database of Panchamahakavyas with Hyperlinks"** for her Post Doctoral Fellowship.

The Five Mahakavyas chosen by her are: **Raghuvamsa, Kumarasambhava, Kiratarjuniya, Sisupalavadha and Naishadha Kavya**.

In her present pursuit she is going to prepare a lexicon of all the Finite Verbs used in the said Mahakavyas with different search parameters.

Hope this information is useful for you.

Best Wishes,

**Dr. Rani Sadasiva Murty**
