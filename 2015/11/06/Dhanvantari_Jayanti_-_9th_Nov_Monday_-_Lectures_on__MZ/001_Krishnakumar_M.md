नमस्ते,

  

It looks as if DhanatrayodaSee or DhanTeras (Dhanvantari Jayanti) is followed by Deepavali (Lakshmi Jayanti).

  

The Dhanvantari Jayanti is associated with the Samudra Manthan, which is recounted in several sastras. The above sequence seems to have a basis in Vishnu Purana. But others like Mahabharata (Astika Parva), Ramayana (Book 1,Canto XLV) and Srimad Bhagavata (VIII.8) seem to have a different order, where after Lakshmi Jayanti only Dhanvantari appears with the Amrit. This seems more logical too. Why should Devas and Danavas exert for Samudra Manthan after their target is achieved, which is getting Amrit.

  

Are there any other reasons or आधार for this dichotomy?

  

pranams,

  

Krishna Kumar
