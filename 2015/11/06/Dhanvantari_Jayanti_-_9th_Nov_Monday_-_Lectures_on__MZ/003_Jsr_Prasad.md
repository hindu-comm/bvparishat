Namaste,  
  

Thanks for your question, which I can partially answer. There used to be great Ayurvedic scholars like Dr. Achanta Lakshmipati, Dr. Deevi Gopalacharyulu, Captain Dr. Sriramamurthy who revived Ayurvedic studies especially in south India. I am told that Dr. Deevi Gopalacharyulu (a *vaikhanasAgama* follower) use to celebrate Dhanvantari Jayanti on *kArtika krsNa trayodasi* instead of *Ashvayuja* *krsNa trayodasi.* People like him use to have immense influence on the followers of Ayurveda, particularly in Andhra. So, your question is appropriate, to celebrate the Jayanti after Deepavali.  
  
Some others believe that celebrating Jayanti before Deepavali is based on *cAndramAna* calculation. However, we are practiced to celebrate this event on this day, for the past few years, habitually.  

  

Regards,  

Prasad
