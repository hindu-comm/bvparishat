Thanks to Prof. Aklujkar for his article.

  

Thanks to SL Abhyankar also for his detailed study of the verse in his blog:

  

<https://slabhyankar.wordpress.com/2010/05/26/learning-sanskrit-by-a-fresh-approach-lesson-6/>  

  

A question on the derivation and explanation वसुध at length by SL Abhyankar in his study of the verse

> वसुभि: धार्यते अतः वसुधा = (the entity that) Is taken care of, > protected by Vasu’s, hence, वसुधा  

  

  

and the detailed explanation on Vasu. How do we get with the derivation? Is it by just by the imagination of the meanings of Vasu? Or the derivation of the word वसुधा with reference to the context from any PUrana? Or by derivation grammatically?

  

  

Grammatically it would be वसु+धा+ क - टाप् कर्तरि.

  

वसुधा¦ स्त्री **वसूनि धीयन्तेऽस्यां धा घञर्थे** आधारे कः, **वसूनि दधाति** घा--क वा । पृथिव्याम् अमरः।  

  

How the word is derived grammacally as explained by Mr. Abhyankar?

  

The same meaning by वसुन्धरा - वसूनि धरतीति from धृ धारणपोषणयोः। वसूनां धरा, धरतीति धरा, वसूनां धरा वसुन्धरा, and not the reverse. The word वसु has got many meaninngs and all the meanings need not be huddled into the word वसुधा, but as the name रत्नगर्भा वसुन्धरा suggests, it stands in वसुधा also holding jewels, treasures inside, it is called by all these three names. वसुधा. This is the meaning we get without any dictionary meaning or citations from Purana on Vasu-s.

  

वसु¦ न० वस--उ । १ धने २ रत्ने अमरः ३ वृद्ध्यौषधे ४ श्यामे

मेदि० । ५ स्वर्णे विश्वः ६ जले च सि० कौ० । ७ वकवृक्षे

८ सूर्य्ये ९ वह्नौ १० रश्मौ ११ गणदेवताभेदे च पु० अमरः ।

  

There are 10 other meanings apart from the last 11th the eight Vasu-s. In one wants, one can thrust all the above meanings into वसुधा and elongate the explate the explanation of the versae.

  

Anyhow thanks for the elaborate explanation on वसुधा, AND THE whole verse.
