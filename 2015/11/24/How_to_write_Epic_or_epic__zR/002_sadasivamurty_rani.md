In the conventional - conceptual English Grammar texts like those by the dual authors Wren and Martin The as a definite article recommended to be prefixed before : The Vedas, The Ramayana and The Mahabharata. For the other popular or less popular Kavyas 'The' is not recommended.

1. So the first option is to directly write: The Ramayana, The Mahabharata without the word "epic".

2. If "epic" is in our preference:

The epic Ramayana, The epic Mahabharata is suggestible.

Since epic is a common noun it should have a small letter only in its beginning and not a capital letter.

  

3. Most of the modern writers, as a part of their practice of highlighting certain texts, are using capital letters in the beginning of the each of the words in a phrase. It is for the reason that most of the readers do not have enough patience to read when a writing or posting is very lengthy. So, in order to draw the attention of such readers, the capitals are used even before the common nouns against the rules of normal English writing.

Let us wait for the opinion of other scholars in this context.
