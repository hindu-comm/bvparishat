i think prof. murty is right. in fact the europeans called illiad and odyssey as epics, hence they gave this title to our ramayana and the mahabhaarata. 'epic' being a common noun, in a sentence it would come as such, not with a capital beginning. but 'mahabhaarata' being a proper noun will start with a capital. the definite article will be prefixed to 'epic' as a norm to distinguish it from other epics.

  

but in a title, such as of an essay or an article it could be 'the Epic Mahaabhaarata'. in case of prof. joshi it is "balavadapi síkshitaanaam

'kadaacid' apratyayam cetah ! regds.
