During the Sri Devi Sarannavaratri Mahotsavams at Warrangal of Telangana State in the age old Bhadrakali Temple, the Goddess is decorated as Sakambari Devi and worshiped with Bhadrakali Sahasra Nama stotra.

It is a regular practice there to worship Bhadrakali in the decoration of Sakambari. The local people also believe that worshipping Bhadrakali as Sakambari is of great worth.

So Badrakali Sahasra Nama Stotra may be considered as Sakambari Sahasra nama stotra.

So this information be useful to the pursuers.
