Dear Dr. Bhat,  
Is Shakambari Sahsranama text available in printed puranic or tantrik literature? If yes kindly point out where is the Sahasranam. If not where can one get more information and which manuscripts need to be consulted. this is what I understand from the question. Lets wait for Prof Mishra's reply. Thanks for information about Lakshmi Sahsranama. I already wrote about the blog site which gives details about Shakambari Kavacha from Skanda Purana.
