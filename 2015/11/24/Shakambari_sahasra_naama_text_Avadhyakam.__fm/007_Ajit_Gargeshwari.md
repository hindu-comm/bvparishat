Sakambari as a Devi is referred to in the Devi Mahatmya part of Markandeya Purana.  
  
Please see the shakambara Kavacha here The blog says the slokas are from its from skanda purana  
  
<http://hindupad.com/shakambari-kavacham/>  
  

As Shankaraji has said Shankambari Sahasranam might be a khila text and we need to find out if it has been printed in the various editions of the puranas.
