i shall try it out at chennai wher i am at the month's end for a seminar on vidyaranya muni. the ncc project must have some inf. on thie sahasranaama.

s'aaakambhari may be in later tantra-s. in 11th canto of devimahatmyam it's obvious. but the genesis of this deity must be looked in to. in padma it may be a later interpolation ! regds.
