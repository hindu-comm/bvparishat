The request is not clear and hence many responses. But his friend wants to bring out a critical edition and has he endeavoured without having the details of the manuscripts? Or he wants to locate it in the Purana text he mentioned only? The subject line seems that the text itself is wanted and not the manuscripts of it while he requires साहित्य of the Sahasranama for survey of the literature available on the topic.

Anyhow, the book is available for purchase from the publisher in Chennai a commercial publication, though not a critical Edition:
