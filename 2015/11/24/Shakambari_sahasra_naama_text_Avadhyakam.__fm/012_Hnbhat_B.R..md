Thank you for your observation of the link in which the name wrongly typed of something went wrong in the link.

The description on the page is here below:

**Sri** **Sakambarisahasranama** **Stotram**

**ஸ்ரீ சாகம்பரீ ஸஹஸ்ரநாம ஸ்தோத்ரம்**

Book Language : Tamil  
Book Edition : 1  
Number of Pages : 48  
Book code: 406**Price per Unit (piece):**Rs. 8.00  
ஸ்ரீ சாகம்பரீ ஸஹஸ்ரநாமாவளி, ஸகலகாரிய ஸித்திக்கான முறைகள் முதலியவைகளுடன் கூடியது.

where it is correctly described by the publisher. And the inner sample page also has the text printed in Tamil script.

But the title in the link went wrong. Try this link

Sri Sakambarisahasranama Stotram  
ஸ்ரீ சாகம்பரீ ஸஹஸ்ரநாம ஸ்தோத்ரம்

<http://www.lifcobooks.com/booktitles/details/146/10/sri-sahasranama-series/sri-sakambarisahasranama-stotram.html>

Sorry for the inconvenience. There were series of Sahasranama-s and all are in Tamil script and hence wanted the text in Devanagari. Only Mishra or his friend would precisely could answer what he wants.

For manuscripts, they should search in Ophret'ss Catalogue available online or NCC available in Libraries. There is no such manuscript by the title in the Aufrecht Catalogus Catalogorum beginning with शाक\*. One may look for similar entries under शा letter in NCC.
