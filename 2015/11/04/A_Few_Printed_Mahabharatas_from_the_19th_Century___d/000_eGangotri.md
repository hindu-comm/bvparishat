Hi :  
  
I would like to primarily post to this Group to bring to the Kind attention discovery of Old , Unknown and forgotten books and manuscripts.  
  
So the first in the series is this Mahabharata by a unknown publisher from Calcutta in the Late 19th Century.  
  
I only found seven volumes. But they must have several volumes.  
  
I have just uploaded them at my Site:
