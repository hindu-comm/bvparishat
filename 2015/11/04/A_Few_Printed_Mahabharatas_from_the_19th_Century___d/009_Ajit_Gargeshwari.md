Dear Prof. Chaitanya ji,  
  
Thank you for sharing this typed text with the group But this is not the edition that has been scanned as I have said before this is The English translation not the Sanskrit mula  

  

Regards  
Ajit Gargeshwari  
न जायते म्रियते वा कदाचिन्नायं भूत्वा भविता वा न भूयः।  
अजो नित्यः शाश्वतोऽयं पुराणो न हन्यते हन्यमाने शरीरे।।2.20।।
