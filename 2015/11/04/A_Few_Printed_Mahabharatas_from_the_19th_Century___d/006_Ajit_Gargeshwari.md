Its not available  at least "Pratap Chandra Roy's edition which was posted". We all need to compliment eGangotri for the terrific job they are doing. We often complain manuscripts are hard to access. Please see the blog hundreds on valuable manuscripts from Kashmir region is being made available for free. We need more volunteers like eGangotri to make our great manuscript resources available and accessible. I feel this list whose members are all scholars need to support and guide such initiatives and encourage people who are doing them wholeheartedly After all at the end of the day who will be benefited it us scholars  

As far as I could locate the English translation Pratap Chandra Roy's edition of MBh is available not the Sanskrit text and definitely not its first edition.
