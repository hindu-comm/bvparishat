Respected scholars

Greetings.

Sirs,  

Throughout the Indian diaspora this activity is on and it is not only non- Indians but unfortunately people of Indian origin are contributing in denigrating the millennium human culture. Giving this culture the name of Hindu was in itself the strong blow towards the burial of the wisdom of the ancient sages who belong not to India but to the whole world.  

Mauritian Minister of Education is finalising the nine year schooling project without Sanskrit in the curriculum.It has decided to create academies and Mahatma Gandhi Institute is the Academy for arts and Culture and Indian languages and Indian culture.  

Mrs. Malti AUCKLE

How can an academy for Arts and Indian languages not include Sanskrit bur include Creole and Arabic?

**"विनाश काले विपरीत बुद्धि।"**

**"History repeats itself" is the adage. Foreigners were always helped by unscrupulous local people these ignorant people destroy perfection and establish imperfection and ignorance.**

**I feel very helpless in not being able to convince my own institution to request policy makers to look into this issue**

  

**Thank You**

**Mrs Malti Auckle
