Lack of Sanskrit training in some of the novice bloggers is also atrocious.  

People have a tendency to tout Sanskrit material to add gravity to their blog.  

Some copy from the transliterated text and interpret in their vernacular (I think).  

Massive distortion occurs. I saw a beautifully produced Ayurveda book with  

beautiful fonts, quotes incorrect in grammar. Please teach Sanskrit wherever  
you can. Promotion of Sanskrit is a massive undertaking.
