I agree with your thoughts Mr Kalivardhanam posted here on BVP.

I was unhappy with internal and external Indology research. I came across educated people from almost all countries of the world. I talked to them about the ancient connection of India to their countries. They offered new information which is difficult to obtain in India. This has created interest in me of finding consistent and connected history of the ancient India. Thanks. N. R. Joshi
