I agree with Prof Misra's views in parts but formal scholarship is a must to be critical of academician let me illustrate what I mean can one criticize quantum mechanics General Theory of relativity of matter unless you are trained mathematician and pan physicist So also unless one is a trained historian has made deep studies and is unmoved by blogs and publicity stunts will be able to criticize their peers better than an online petition a blog and unverified claims and propaganda war. That was my point.. Blogs petitions are not the way They only get you publicity that's all.  
  
I am also conscious of the fact that one may not be affiliated to universities or institutions but still they can be outstanding scholars there is no doubt. I know Prof P.V. Kane a great authority on Dharmashastra was lawyer by profession one can have two or more profession but deep studies access to the right books and training is a must. We have on this list many outstanding scholars who are not full time professors with universities.  

I hope you see my point. This is third mail but I thought i must clarify.
