Dear Michel Daninoji,  
  

I agree with Ajitji,What is most important is that it is time to think of bringing out a book on Ancient Indian History with correct chronology. "Raja kalasya Karaanam". Once we have the book with correct chronology all the polities and other aspects of history of the different times would automatically fall in line. Sir Willian Jonesas
tried to prove Chandragupta Maurya to be contemporary of Alexander. and I exposed that in my paper in 2008. I also exposed the false interpretation of the Dotted Record and this has shown that Max muller's dependence on the wrong interpretation of the Dotted Record was at the root of the Aryan Invasion Theory. Has the ICHR paid any attention to that?19th century BCE  

  

Among the signatories, I saw the name of Dr. B.B.Lal, the former Director general of Archaeological Survey of India, but he too toes the line of the Marxist historians with his date of the Mahabharata war,and that is due to the fact that Dr. Lal is not aware of the 19th century date of Lord Buddha.  
  

As I can see, there may not be any use of sending petition, unless we work earnestly to bring out the correct book on Ancient Indian History. There was one scholar from Pondicherry, who made a valiant attempt to give the correct chronology of Lord Buddha in the 19th century BCE, but he made the great mistake in making the date Lord Mahavira too as 19th century BCE, whereas in reality Lord Mahavira was living in the 6th century BCE. The Pondicherry scholar also tried to show that Ashoka sent emissaries to Greek kings, whereas it was a Gupta king Ashokaditya did that in the 3rd- 4th century BCE. Further, nobody seems to have
noticed that the polity in the Arthashastra was different from that in the Megasthenes's Indica and this shows that Asoka Maurya did live many centuries before the Guptas.  
  

In my opinion the ICHR should arrange to have a group of dedicated scholars, who can bring out the much needed book on Ancient Indian History, with correct chronology, as early as possible. Any half-hearted effort like sending a petition and hoping that the petition would silence the opponents is like building castle in the air.
