Namaste,



Some members may be interested in the attached statement reproduced [today in The Hindu](http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/historians-archaeologists-scholars-call-for-unbiased-and-rigorous-new-historiography-of-india/article7888794.ece) and other papers. It was released yesterday in response to two recent statements by groups of historians more or less representing the Leftist School of Indian historiography in India and overseas.



The matter is of great importance — it concerns the way in which Indian students learn about India and the image they develop of their country and culture.



We have also placed the statement online as a petition for those who would like to register their support of our statement. If you do, may I request you to kindly spare a little time to:



• Sign the online petition (the procedure is very simple and takes two or three minutes). May I request you to consider leaving a comment as well as your name; this will strengthen the petition and will take no more than a minute or two. (Of course the online signature can also be anonymous for those who wish it so.)

• Forward this email to your networks so as to reach out to as many people as possible and ask them to consider signing the petition.
