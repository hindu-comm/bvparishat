Dear Ajitji,  

The "formal scholarship" does not necessarily come by reading a few books or attending some lectures.  

This has been a trap to block open research propelled by a few. There was a video of a lecture by Bharat Gupt  

posted here. That should be understood. Interpretation of India would be done by people who have  

passion than individuals who tout "academy". The history would emerge through many of such  

marginal effects which are better than somebody creating correlation theory on culture. I am glad  

that India got freedom before all was rewritten. Be hopeful. Let people put their efforts. We support  

them what we can, but let us not block their expression on interpreting their own life. We have to help  

develop an analytic process in every field of Indology studies. Do promote Sanskrit studies, such that  

people have access to the source material.  

Best regards,  

BM
