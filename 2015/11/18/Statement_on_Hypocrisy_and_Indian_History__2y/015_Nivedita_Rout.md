The Statement of Dr. Bijoyji is very very true in the context.

  

This is even realised long back and stated in the Upanishad and prayed for the Divine Force for revelation: "hirnmayena patrena satyasyapihitam mukham\| tatvam pusanapavrnu".  

  

  

We always forget that "sarvam staye pratisthitam". We are moved forward by the Force of Truth even in our ignorance or with our limited knowledge which leads the aspirants to study Sanskrit not for the sake of the means of living but truly to be refined being (samskruta) to see, realise the complete "Truth" and establish it and that is true knowledge and the key to discover the true history, culture, religion, science etc. of our country "Bha-rata".

  

Regards,

Nibedita
