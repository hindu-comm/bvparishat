I don't want to enter into any debate I am placing my views Thanks  

  

We have often to many petitions. Instead of petitions I suggest academic historians do the necessary work and correct distortions in historical books, re write or re interpret history as the evidence points out. Its well known historical interpretation do always have a subjective element involved which can never be removed unless a one has a computer or a robot to interpret all historical documents.  
  

We have too many blogs and counter statements of by software engineer mechanical engineers retired doctors on history especially in ancient Indian history,Aryan problem etc. There is now a new trend every other ritired science professor has become a renowned Indologist and sanskrit expert. I don't think a full time professional scholar need to respond and get carried away by such blogs and comments.  

  

If a trained full time historian with the right credentials do have differing view whats wrong. I don't think a full time university scholar need to respond to some engineer or doctor who makes random comments on his or her book or write a point by point refutation. I don't think a academic writer need to respond to someone just because we like the someones ideology or view and it suits our interest. Do artists review relativity theory no so is the case of history.  
  

There is no leftist rightist hindutava, Sikh or any other history There should be only one story the evidences must speak itself and views will change progress in knowledge improves which is always incremental slow an yet steady.  
  

If we keep simple and focus on our studies an train future students to do better work most of the other details will be taken care by itself  

This is my view I have a mind to make an online petition on this.
