Dear Ajitji,  
  

In sciences we can observe and discard. Hence one cultivates the method of building on the  

past scholarship. In Indology, the past is rigged. One gets wrong information by indulging in it.  

Unfortunately the so called university studies on Indology is so convoluted that it is better that  

one escapes them.  I do not know how it has happened. When I think that everything I was  

taught in school as history could be bogus, I really question the historian's integrity. We must  

say we do not know rather than creating "knowledge" by connecting dots.
India slept for a long  
time. Lately I read something which are well bound and promoted as "translation". It is pure rubbish.  

One does not translate a source by using a dictionary. One must understand. The "translators"  

get tired to read the full sentence and have zero understanding of the scene and the visual.  

As we are speaking, many of the old Faculty are changing their stance and getting towards  
objectivity. It is slow.  

  
The problem indeed is serious! I can only comment. I did not look when I was young.  

Let all young participate at least to figure out that Ramayana is not a sex story! Let them  

challenge the entertainment industry to be more sincere towards depicting characters.  

Let scholars jump in when misrepresentations occur.  We do not have people to solve  

the country's cultural problem. Then some show up with degrees having never read a text fully.   

There are a lot of touts promoting themselves as academic scholars in various garbs. India  

has been subjected to this humiliation. Let the new youth rescue it.
The middle managers  

and the politicians failed under various pretexts. Most likely they got into survival mode  
than the rescuing mode. The disease is deep! In my view, a new India would emerge  
from these multiplicity of native views. Let us agree to guide the young to help discover  
the new India! I think there lies India's future.  
  

Best regards,  

BM
