I have said before I am not entering into any debate but was my view Thanks for allowing me to clarify what i intended to say  
  
I agree with some views of Srivatsa ji and yours as well but its formal scholarship that is required. Do you want amateurs and bloggers to make all future researches? Any one who reads a few history books should they start judging all history of mankind or should experts judge history. Should trained Sanskrit scholars teach advanced Sanskrit and make substantial research or any one who can recite or understand a few sholkas or a few elementary texts after the age fifty or sixty make noises? Do you expect serious academicians and scholars to respond to such outbursts. why should they? That is not their focus or interests. Serious researchers and academicians all over the world have their own forums to express dissent and make criticism why does one need to make media headlines and petitions. Such online petitions are more political than academic. They do it to gain publicity and nothing else. I don't think anything so serious has happened that all good historical research has been stopped or is under threat in this country by any one or by any group It was in this context I wrote my previous mail.
