hariH OM,

 The reason why we find doctors, retired scientists etc. entering the field is because of the havoc the leftists and the colonial historians have caused in the field.

 Secondly, being a scientist is not a disqualification to being a historian. This is the academic racism used by the leftists as a convenient ruse to escape the hard work of refuting the opposite side.

 Thirdly, study of history is not strictly uni-dimensional. It calls for investigation of evidence from genetics etc. For which scientists are better placed to investigate. Any serious history department anywhere in the best university brings in talent from other fields to analyze and interpret evidence.

 Fourthly, the desire that the evidence speak for itself is utopian. History has been more than just history, it has been a weapon of war. Hence, anyone desiring the security and perpetuity of his civilization is a welcome friend. His credentials notwithstanding.

 Hence, if there is any such trend of scientists etc. entering any field, it should be welcomed.

svasti,  
 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,  
 shrivathsa.
