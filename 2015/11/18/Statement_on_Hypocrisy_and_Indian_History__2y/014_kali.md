HariH OM!

  

I totally agree with Bijoy ji especially his following words are so Truthful that it suddenly struck anote of

  

concordance with my inner feelings:

  

"In Indology, the past is rigged. One gets wrong information by indulging in it.  
Unfortunately the so called university studies on Indology is so convoluted that it is better that  
one escapes them."

  

When I was a student I never doubted the text books nor the historians.
Only after growing up,

  

and reading so many divergent accounts did I realize that we have been fed with distorted picture of our history.

  

"There are a lot of touts promoting themselves as academic scholars invarious garbs. India  
has been subjected to this humiliation. Let the new youth rescue it."

  

  

Please go into the background of so many 'Scholars' who recently signed the petition in India and abroad

  

politicising the current trend to revisit the History. One is right in presuming their leftist leanings and perverted mind set.

  

"In my view, a new Indiawould emergefrom these multiplicity of native views. Let us agree to guide the young  
to help discoverthe new India! I think there lies India's future."

  

Yes, let us welcome any initiative, irrespective of proven scholarship in the form of Phds, to correct the course

  

and create a new air of corrective thinking.

  

DhanyavadaH
