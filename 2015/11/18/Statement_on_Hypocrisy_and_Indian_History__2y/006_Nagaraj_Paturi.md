\>Its well known historical interpretation do always have a subjective element involved which can never be removed unless a one has a computer or a robot to interpret all historical documents.  

Very well said. That is why it has been said that history is always a subjective painting, not an objective photograph.



It is this subjective element which is in contradiction to



\> There is no leftist rightist hindutava, Sikh or any other history There should be only one story the evidences must speak itself and views will change progress in knowledge improves which is always incremental slow an yet steady.



That there is not a single monolithic story of an event is not a problem. It is the most contemporary way of thinking to agree that there is noTHE history of anything there are always 'histories' of it.



But the problem here is, 'who said it first?'. Present petition is not an objection to one way , say, leftist way of doing history. It is the objection to objections raised by the leftist and other similar ideologues to a non-leftist way of writing/doing history. It is these ideologues who tend to label certain ways of writing history as 'hindutva history writing' and so on.



Debates are always an essential healthy feature of academic process.



The problem comes when one debating side raises hue and cry about the other side making its voice heard. That is what the leftist and other similar ideologues are doing towards a non-leftist way of writing/doing history.



Due to a huge amount of ideology based recruitment inside university departments and a huge sycophancy based inbreeding there,an impression is created thatmajority ofthe 'professional' university employed historians belong to a certain ideological strand. When other well meaning scholars counter writings from that ideology, it is then easy to brush them aside under the label of 'non-professional', non-university etc.
