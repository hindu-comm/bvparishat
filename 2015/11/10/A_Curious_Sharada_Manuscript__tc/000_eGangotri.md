Dear All:  
  
We have just digitized a Sharada Manuscript  
Guru Mandal Puja Vidhan  
  
which is written in a very curious and distinct register of Sharada.  
  
<http://www.scribd.com/doc/289107846>  
  
It is particularly rich in Mantras as a cursory examination showed.  
  
I will be happy if Sharada Experts on this List can shed some light on what this different register implies
