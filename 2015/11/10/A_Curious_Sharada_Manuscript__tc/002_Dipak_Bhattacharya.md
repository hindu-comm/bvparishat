Not much enlightening information can be given by me. But the follwing are certain.  

1.This is different from 16th century Sarada of Srinagar.  
  

2\. I have not seen two Sarada mss offering identical scripts  

3.The reason for the above is not far to seek. Sarada was in use over a large region of the North -- Kashmir, Kumaon, Panjab,most probably the present HP etc.  

Apparently, this is also not exactly the same script as used by Baj Bahadur Chand of the Kumaons.Was the manuscript found in the HP? I spoke elsewhere of the possibility of civilizational activity and interaction between Kashmir and HP in the first millennium CE. Much of our present ideas -including mine- are guess works. A proper history of the Sarada is a desideratum.
