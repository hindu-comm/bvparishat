Yes. Such efforts are on in India! The Centre for Ancient History & Culture at Jain University ([www.jainuniversity.ac.in](http://www.jainuniversity.ac.in)) Bangalore is established to bring together an interdisciplinary group of academics to delineate an "insider" view of history. However it is still a very small group struggling to gain critical mass.
