This is a vast field, with a huge data of bibliography.



One way of approaching is to check, say, for the term called spiritual ecology. The Wikipedia page for this gives a good number of books under 'further reading'.



One of the widely read and discussed books on Europe in this connection is "Man's Responsibility for Nature: Ecological Problems and Western Traditions" by John Arthur Passmore



<https://books.google.co.in/books/about/Man_s_Responsibility_for_Nature.html?id=mWMLAQAAIAAJ&redir_esc=y>



Another most widely debated article, again with regard to Europe , is Lynn White Junior's article, "The Historical Roots of Our Ecologic Crisis" which is[here](https://www.uvm.edu/~gflomenh/ENV-NGO-PA395/articles/Lynn-White.pdf) .



Another epoch making book from a Japanese author is "The **One**-**Straw Revolution**" by Masanobu Fukuoka



which is [here](http://www.google.co.in/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&frm=1&source=web&cd=6&ved=0CEAQFjAFahUKEwiuur2VhZjJAhXDTY4KHaM6Bs0&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.appropedia.org%2Fimages%2Fd%2Fd3%2FOnestraw.pdf&usg=AFQjCNHMWaHjX6F81SL7yJZFSCTo-1yV_Q&sig2=bk4UAMSTehPmbXktx9L7Ag).



I read a book published by University of Madras called , "Technology and Human Destiny" by Henryk Skolimowski. It is[here](http://www.amazon.com/Technology-Human-Destiny-University-Philosophical/dp/B002CZZVJQ) and It is

# Technology and Human Destiny - Madras University Philosophical Series No. 37 

Recently I found a website dedicated for his work [here.](http://www.ecophilosophy.org/)A list of his books is [here.](http://www.goodreads.com/author/list/340265.Henryk_Skolimowski)



Another book "Myths of Science and Technology" by McCormac was also brought out by the University of Madras.
