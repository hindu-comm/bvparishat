Dr. Niranjan Saha ji,

  

The following books connect the Ecological Teachings in Hinduism (mainly Vedas and Shastras) and their effect on Social structure to some extent. I wish to underline here that Ecology was an integrated undercurrent into the respective Shastra starting from Vedas. In particular shastra such as Vrkshayurveda (Krishi Parashara, Kaashyapiya krishisukti, Upavana Vinoda, Abhilashitaarthachintamani, etc.),Ayurveda (Charaka Samhita, Ashtanga Sangraha, Bhavaprakasha Nighantu, etc.) andVaastu (Manushyalaya chandrika, Shiparatna, etc.) - Thus the Ecological teachings are tightly connected with Living (Vaastu), Food (Agriculture - Vrkshayurveda), Medicine (Ayurveda) - it is to be noted that these 3 distinct shastra follow the sametaxonomyclassifications of plants, land. soil and other substances.
