Dear list members,

  

Does anybody know of any complete translation(s) of Mahābhāṣya other than the the seven-volume Marathi translation by Vasudev Shastri Abhyankar (ed. by his son Kashinath Vasudev Abhyankar)?

  

I am not looking for incomplete translations (e.g. translation of the Navāhnika by Charudev Shastri) but complete translations. I am not sure if the translation by Joshi and Roodbergen is complete.

  

Thanks, Nityanand
