Thanks, I do not think it is complete. As per the website of Ramlal Kapoor Trust, the Hindi translation is done only till the second chapter. Their website says the fourth volume of this Hindi translation is in press.

  

Please see entry number 92 in <http://www.rlktrust.com/docs/BOOKS%20DETAILS.pdf>
