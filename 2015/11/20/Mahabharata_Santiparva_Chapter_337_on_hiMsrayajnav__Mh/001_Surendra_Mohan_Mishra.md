one could look to ishvara krishna's sankhyakarika verse no. 2 and it's comms. 'aja' could mean both. but it could not be so that people mistook 'aja'(old grain unfit to germinate) for 'aja' (goat). 'adhvara' for a sacrifice also shows absence of violence. kalidasa may be seen for his ' pas'umaaranakarmadaaruno 'nukampaamriduko 'pi s'ritriyah' etc. as manu says: krita yuga is tapas, tretaa for satya, dvaapara for sacrifices and kali for daana !
