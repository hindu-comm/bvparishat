Good discussion. I think 'himsra-yajna' should mean a sacrifice involving violence to animals. Since at one point of time such animal-slaughter-involving sacrifices were there, the need arose to get rid of them.During Sandhi-puujaa in Navaraatra a goat that is being sacrificed is told: छाग त्वंबलिरूपेण मम पार्श्वमिहागतः / अतस्त्वां घातयिष्यामि यस्माद्यज्ञे वधो 'वधः //

  

Sacrifice involving violence was prevalent and this was the main cause why Mahavir and Buddha preached against violence.Jayadev wrote: 'nindasi yajnavidher ahaha s'rutijaatam sadaya-hridaya-darshita-pas'ughaatam' etc.
