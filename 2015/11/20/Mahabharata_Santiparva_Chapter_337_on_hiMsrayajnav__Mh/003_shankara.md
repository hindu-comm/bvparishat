Mishraji,

  

Thank you very much for giving useful references. I will explore them.  

  

In fact I didn't mean that our ancestors mistook the meaning of Aja. I am merely try to find out whether there are other similar discussion/debates in our ancient texts on the ethics of animal sacrifice, as we find in the story of in Mahabharata Santiparva quoted in my query.  



regards  
shankara
