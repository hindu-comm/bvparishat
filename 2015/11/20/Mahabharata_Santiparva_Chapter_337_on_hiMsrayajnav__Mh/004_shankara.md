Bhat mahodaya,

  

  

I didn't mean that our ancestors mistook the meaning of Aja. I am merely try to find out whether there are other similar discussion/debates in our ancient texts on the ethics of animal sacrifice, as we find in the story of in Mahabharata Santiparva quoted in my query.

  

The word हिंस्रयज्ञवर्जनम् was not coined by me. I just quoted it from the Mahabharata Tika of Nilakantha Chaturdhara. I assumed that its meaning must be 'non-performance of animal sacrifice' or 'avoiding animal sacrifice in Yajnas'. Please correct me if I am wrong.



regards  
shankara
