Pranams to all,

  

Mahabharata Santiparva Chapter 337 (in Gita Press edition and Chitrasala edition) discusses हिंस्रयज्ञवर्जनम् - non-performance of animal sacrifice. To illustrate this Bhishma narrates the story of Uparichara Vasu and the debate between devas and rishis regarding animal sacrifice. As per the tika of Nilakantha, the purpose of this chapter is avoidance of animal sacrifice - हिंस्रयज्ञवर्जनम्

  

I am giving below a few verses from the chapter. This might be helpful in locating the chaper (since chapter numbers are not the same in various editions of Mahabharata).

  

ऋषय ऊचुः\|\|  
बीजैर्यज्ञेषु यष्टव्यमिति वै वैदिकी श्रुतिः \| अजसञ्ज्ञानि बीजानि छागं न घ्नन्तुमर्हथ \|\|४\|\|  
नैष धर्मः सतां देवा यत्र वध्येत वै पशुः \| इदं कृतयुगं श्रेष्ठं कथं वध्येत वै पशुः \|\|५\|\|  

  

I would like to know whether the same story or other similar stories are found in other Puranas or Vedic literature. I request the all learned members of this forum to help me to identify similar passages in other Puranas or Vedic literature.



regards  
shankara
