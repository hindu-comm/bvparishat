Thinking of the etymology of the wordहिंस्र from Dhaatuहिंस्हिंस्र should mean cruelty. That should include cruelty of any kind, not just to animals.

It is true that the wordहिंस्र is very closely connected toपशु. But as an independent word, the wordहिंस्र need not be always connected only withपशु.

Actuallyहिंस्रपशु is such wild animal for whom,हिंसा is essential not onlyfor its subsistence, but it is also its survival instinct. Nobody has ever heard of aहिंस्रपशु being sacrificed. So Question ofहिंस्रयज्ञवर्जनम् does not arise for anyहिंस्रपशु.

I think one must first decipher the compound wordहिंस्रयज्ञवर्जनम्and only then discuss whether the word means cruelty only to animals. May I decipher it asहिंस्रस्य यज्ञेवर्जनम्or asयस्मिन् यज्ञे हिंस्रं तस्य वर्जनम्

In Apte's online dictionary meaning of the wordहिंस्र (an adjective)is given asmurderous animal. But the meaning ofहिंस्रपशु is givenas a beast of prey. Somehow the meaning ofहिंस्रपशु as 'a beast of prey'does not appeal.

  

Anyway looking at the wordहिंस्रयज्ञवर्जनम्, which is under discussion, the word itself does not containपशु. Should not we then think of the wordहिंस्रयज्ञवर्जनम् independent of any context withपशु ?
