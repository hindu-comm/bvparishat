The question discussed in the topic is not on eating goats on food in general, but the sacrifice of goats in याग. Please read the question once again in the context, mistaking the word अज for goat to be sacrificed in याग.

Consider the amount of animals to make a river of flesh and blood to make the river चर्मणवती as declared in Mahabharata and sung as the glory Rantideva flowing as a river. It will be clear the question of eating goat for food does not enter the discussion as it is not by misunderstanding of the word अज.
