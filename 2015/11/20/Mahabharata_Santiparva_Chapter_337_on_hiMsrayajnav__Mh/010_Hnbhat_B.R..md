\> Good discussion. I think 'himsra-yajna' should mean a sacrifice involving violence to animals. Since at one point of time such animal-slaughter-involving sacrifices were there, the need arose to get rid of them.During Sandhi-puujaa in Navaraatra a goat that is being sacrificed is told: छाग त्वंबलिरूपेण मम पार्श्वमिहागतः / अतस्त्वां घातयिष्यामि

यस्माद्यज्ञे वधो 'वधः //

This seems to follow the principle of मीमांसा

यस्माद्यज्ञे वधो 'वधः //

which means the हिंसा is याग is not considered as हिंसा at all. I remember it reading in न्यायसिद्धान्तमुक्तावलली. It might be found in original मीमांसा works..

The general Vedic injunction on हिंसा reads as मा हिंस्यात् सर्वे भूतानि holds good even herbals also.

It is prayed स्वधितते मैने हिंसीः.

Another aspect of हिंसा in याग is the श्येनयाग. The killing of श्येन bird in sacrifice is not considered as हिंसा as it is ordained for the याग in Veda. But श्येनयाग itself is considered as हिंसा due to the killing person through this श्येनयाग. This killing is हिंसा.

The question raised is in line with मा हिंस्यात् सर्वा भूतानि and raises voice against the theory that the killing of animals in Yaga is not हिंसा.
