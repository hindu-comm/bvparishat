Thank you for supporting the cause.  

This is a new project which our Minister of education is introducing. Madam the Minister has included all oriental languages .As other languages she has included Arabic and Creole. Its there that the shoe pinches.  

(1) there is no nine year Sanskrit curriculum. But Cultural organisations offer Sanskrit. Bhratiya Vidya Bhavan examinations are  

 organised to the level of Kovid . Students take part in Cambridge School Certificate exams.  

\(11\) there is lack of awareness and no official recognition of the certificates

Hope this much can help

Thank you

Malti
