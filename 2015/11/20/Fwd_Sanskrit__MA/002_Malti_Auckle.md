Respected Sir

Namo namah.

Thank you for these encouraging and comforting words.

I have contacted Arya sabha, sanstan dharma temples federation and other associations, they all say they will support me.

They have given word that on Gangasnaan day each pandit will speak on the the necessity of introducing SKT at all levels. Theme to be reflected for Gangasnaan is SANSKRIT I hope they keep their word.I have also contacted people from the legal profession , akhila purohit mandal Telegu, marathi sanskritik centres and speaking unions.I will meet them next week. Very difficult to get appointment with the PM & Minister of Education.  

Please send me the email id I will certainly write to them.

Thanks again Sir.
