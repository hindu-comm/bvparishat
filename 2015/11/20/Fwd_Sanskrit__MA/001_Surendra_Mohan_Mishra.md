Dear Madam,

  

namo namah !

  

I can understand your pains. I am fully with you and your colleagues who want Sanskrit to come up in Mauritius.This is what I always wanted while being in your institution. In India also Sanskrit people are in two mindsMostly they want Sanskrit to be borne on other languages' shoulders ! Macaulay is gone, but his ghost is haunting the souls of Sanskrit scholars more than any one else !

  

The old economic maxim says: bad money drives out good money out of circulation ! This happens creating awe and woe for the foremost language of the world. After the Bristish left India it seems that more bad money has entered in to the Sanskrit treasury creating obstacles for the good money to thrive and multiply in circulation ! Even though your Govt passed the Sanskrit Speaking Union Bill a couple of years ago, it's reluctance to give Sanskrit to the Mauritian children is unfortunate.

  

I shall give you a few email ids: kindly write to them. I try it with the human resource development ministry which looks after higher education. In the formative years a child must be given Sanskrit. Mauritius is not like any other African nation. It has a nature of it's own. How can Arabic and Creole be there and Sanskrit ousted ? You may also talk to the Arya Sabha and the Sanatan Dharma Sabha in Port Louis.

  

Let me make people write to Shri Aniroodh Jagannath ji.

  

ईश्वरः कुर्यादेवेति कार्ये कुण्ठितकल्पना /

ईश्वरांशः स एवात्र जीवः सङ्कल्पशक्तिमान् ! //

प्रार्थयामो भगवतीं तां सरस्वतीमर्थतः /

सा बुद्धिं जनयत्याशु राजनेतृषु संस्कृताम् //

विना संस्कृतभाषायाः ज्ञानं स्युः बालकाः कथम् /

व्यक्ति-समाज-राष्ट्राणां निर्माणे रक्षणे हिताः ?  

  

Warm regards,

  

SMMishra
