Respected Mrs. Malti AUCKLE,

  

Your effort to bring Sanskrit into the school curriculum in Mauritius is commendable. Promotion of Sanskrit and Sanskrit based education is the need of the hour world over. As educators in Sanskrit, our support to each other is significant in working towards this common goal. I seek some clarifications in the situation with you.

  

\- Is there a nine year Sanskrit curriculum which is having obstacles with implementation there?

\- Is it only lack of awareness, and thereby support for Sanskrit education, that is an impediment in implementation of Sanskrit education there?

  

I work with Goloka Education, involved in development of Sanskrit curriculum and resources. With some clarity about your challenges we may be able aid you in your noble cause in whatever capacity we can.

  

With kind regards
