We are immigrants. We settle with what we got.  

I had a choice between Oriya and Sanskrit. I settled for Oriya.  

We will repeat next year Nov. I will do Sanskrit.  
  

We want each poet to recite a poem and then follow up with one's own composition.  

The goal is to encourage the young to write. Not many write new these days.  

All seem to interpret.  
  

Please encourage your students to write and you publish a creative work every five to ten years.  

I only have two full Sanskrit poems in my thirty years of Sanskrit studies. The environment  

of appreciation and discussion does not exist. Please send any new material, I will have it presented.  
  

We will do a "Voice of the Youth" in the Spring which may not have any other language besides English.  

Again the goal is to develop creativity. Sometimes I feel lucky that people are coming together.  

We are called South Asian Poets of New England. It comprises people from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal,  

Sri Lanka and Burma. Hopefully we create a voice through such exercises.  
  

How is Language Diversity Day celebrated in India?
