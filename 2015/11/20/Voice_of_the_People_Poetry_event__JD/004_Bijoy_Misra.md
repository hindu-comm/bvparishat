Friends,  
I should have also added that the people who are immigrating have very little literature  

with them and almost a blank vocabulary. They seem to have picked up language from  

the movies, have no respect or interest in spelling. This includes English.  Some use  
transliteration as a practice claiming that they have forgotten the native tongue.  
I did not want to be critical, but it is pathetic. Education system has rotted.  

  

Let me not drag this thread. Hopefully there is another forum. You may write to me  

privately if you think in these lines.  

  

Best regards,  

BM
