Dear friends,

  

The following may be of interest to you  

  

<http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/12005864/Secret-pagan-basilica-in-Rome-emerges-from-the-shadows-after-2000-years.html>



The article includes a painting discovered at the site which immediately brings to our mind 'dvaa suparnaa sayujaa sakhaayaa' from Rigveda sukta (1.164) mantras 20, 21 & c. Mantra 20 is also well-known in VEdanta. More info on the find is needed to definitively make the connection. But the people supposedly belonging to 'Neopythagoreanism' school of thought who created these artifacts apparently shared with the VEda the idea of immortality of human soul, re-birth and union of soul with Divine etc. There is a reference mentioning influence of Oriental thought on these Neopythagoreans. Here is a Wikipedia info -
