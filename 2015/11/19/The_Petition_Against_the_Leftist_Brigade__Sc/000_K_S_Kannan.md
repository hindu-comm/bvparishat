The Leftist Brigade is deeply prejudiced, senselessly arrogant, and highly vociferous. Well connected with various fronts, it has its tentacles everywhere, very especially in the mainstream media. Attacking Hindu identity in general, and whatever is inspired by Hinduism is its unhidden and supreme agenda. Annihilation of truth and perpetuation and proliferation of falsehood such as can suit its nasty ideology is its sole objective. Strong intellectual rebuttals and systematic refutations are the need of the hour. Conscientious scholars must all join hands with the signatories and do hard work and reeducate our "educated" class and the general public regarding this systematic besmirching of the oldest, longest, generous, and the most peace-loving civilisation in human history.
