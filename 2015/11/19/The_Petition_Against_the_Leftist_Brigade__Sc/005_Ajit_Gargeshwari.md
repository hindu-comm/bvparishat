===Mod note========  

BVP which has mixed set of members it best not discuss extraneous issues apart from Sanskrit and Sanskrit Studies and its impact on Indian culture The focus of the list is to discuss original texts and their interpretation. That way why this list was created. Not to raise and bring petitions or ideological conflicts. Please take petitions else where unless petitions do have an impact on Sanskrit studies directly Irrespective of who signs petition unless they impact Sanskrit Studies directly please don't bring them here. This list is not formed to discuss political ideologies  

Please don't further post political ideologies here. Thanks
