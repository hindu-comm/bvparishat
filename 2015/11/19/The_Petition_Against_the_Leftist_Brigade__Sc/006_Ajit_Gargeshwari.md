======Mod Not continued===  

On BVP list please don't bring in requests if members have signed petitions from hence forth. I feel such petitions have little or no impact on academic community. Good quality and independent research will continue with or without petitions. Its best to discuss here matters pertaining to academia primarily. and not any thing else. One may discuss any matter pertaining to academia and this list will act as platform between academia and non academia. Any issues how ever important they not concerning Sanskrit studies concerning politics should not be raised on this list. politics is at its best when not raised on this list. Thanks
