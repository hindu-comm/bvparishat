A comment on the moderator's note above (I saw similar sentiments expressed in two separate threads, so I felt it should be addressed in a separate topic).  
Petitions \*by academics\* are certainly useful as a way of recording the opinion of a significant fraction of academic community. This in turn can be used in case non-specialists need to surmise what scholarly opinion on a given topic.As examples:  
  
\* Such petitions and timely responses by friendly scholars were submitted by some concerned Hindus here in California as evidence before a committee which decides what should go in their textbook about Hinduism. Please note that the opposite side submitted opinion such as this -<https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1_QBT-hoqqVTkZkRDBRU3FWNmJiYjZ5Z3Jwb3JvRG9fcEZr/view> , and their verbal testimony, which I witnessed would shock many of you to the core. Please do not underestimate the impact these textbooks have on Hindu kids - see (Omission of women \[[YT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0f2iCtW9BA&feature=player_embedded)\], caricature of caste \[[YT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Y7zt4LtBh8&feature=youtu.be)\])  
\* Petitions by inimical academics do try to affect corporate and government policies. (Eg - petition on narendra modi's visit to california - <https://ia801301.us.archive.org/13/items/AcademicSubversionOfHindus/Faculty%20Statement%20on%20Narendra%20Modi%20Visit%20to%20Silicon%20Valley%20_%20The%20Academe%20Blog.pdf>) It is very negligent of friendly academics to not use the same weapon.  
  
Given the above practical uses of petitions and the like in the \*applications\* of scholarship (yes - including sanskrit / dhaarmic scholarship), it is not appropriate that they should be excluded from the ambit of this mailing list.
