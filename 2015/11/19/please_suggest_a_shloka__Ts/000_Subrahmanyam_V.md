forwarded message  
Shiva Message from Sri Rajiv Malhotra. I am thinking of the dedication of my new forthcoming book "The Battle of Sanskrit" to read as follows: Dedicated to the purva-paksha and uttara-paksha tradition of India. With gratitude to the purva-pakshins (opponents) I have engaged and learned from. What do you think? Pls comment and advise. Also, please suggest a Sanskrit verse I can quote that would convey this meaning, either instead of this statement, or in addition to it. It must convey the ethos of: openness, debate with respect, churning of opposites for creative outcomes, etc. I dont want to clutter this thread, so will only accept truly nice ones. Ideal would be some quotes from a text that conveys this ethos.  
  
Regards,  
rajiv Sriman can you suggest a shloka.
