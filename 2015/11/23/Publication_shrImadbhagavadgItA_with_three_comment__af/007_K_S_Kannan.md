Even the Gita Press fights shy of publishing many Sanskrit *mUla-mAtra* texts, which they used to, earlier. Poor market (not poor marketing).

  

The whole country cannot, alas, boast of more than a few thousand, perhaps, who can go directly to the original Sanskrit texts. (Not unlikely, right now, there are more non-Indians, abroad, who can more or less access the originals.)

  

And who can say which is worse -

apathy of our government or

apathy of the public ?
