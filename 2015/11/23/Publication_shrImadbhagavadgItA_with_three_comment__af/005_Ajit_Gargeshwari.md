A book written in Sanskrit only without any English or regional language to sell even 2,000 copies may take years for a publisher assuming that a publisher is honest. Sanskrit text book are different if they are prescribed by a university as their text book. Imagine the cost involved in printing 10,000 copies of thousand page Sanskrit book and for the publisher to wait for 10 or 20 years with copies left. I spoke with many reputed big publishers who have a large number Sanskrit books they say they don't print more than three to four thousand copies at a time even if its their best selling Sanskrit title. I often see a book priced at Rs .100 intially, every year the publishers puts sticker and prices are revised either to beat inflation or to pass on the interest an capital cost they incur to the readers I don't know. Specialized academic publication is best done by the universities themselves like OUP CUP Sunny etc or by specialized publishing houses where its a low volume long wait business. Popular books selling is different ball game.
