Dear friends,  
  
In the Indian context, some publishers are distributors themselves and they don't have to part with the 55% usually given to the external distributors. They also do cost-saving by making only the soft-bound copies. The paper quality is also sacrificed many a times when the price is to be kept low. Further when the price is kept low the author does not get anything, rather he has to subsidize the publication most of the times. On top of it, to my knowledge, no Indian publisher informs the author as to how many copies of the book have been printed and how many copies have been sold.  
  
In that respect the western publishers are transparent and they have a system by which the author can check himself any time as to how may copies have been sold and what is the royalty due to him. May be, the present government will like to look at this aspect as part their efforts against corruption.  
  

Regards,
