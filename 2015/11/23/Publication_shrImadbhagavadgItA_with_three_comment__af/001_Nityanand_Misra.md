Whats the size of the book (dimensions of the pages)? Is it hardbound or paperback? Quality of pages and printing?

  

I do not know if Chaukhambha Vidya Bhavan are also into charity also or if they made an exception for this book, but in an industry where distributor margins range between 45 to 55 percent of the price of the book and printing costs (if outsourced) range between 20 to 30 percent of the price of the book, it is impossible to be economically profitable if a publisher sells a good quality book of 1000 pages for as low as Rs. 200. Perhaps the publication was financed by some noble person. Or they printed 5 lakh copies with printing like Divya Prakashan (of Baba Ramdev's Divya Yoga Mandir Trust) does, but even that is doubtful. Perhaps they have their own offset printing press but even then the cost is much lower than what I would expect. Rs. 200 for a 1000 page book looks out of the world.
