Not all of it can be attributed to corruption. At any point of time, it is possible to find out figures on online sales made by a publisher on their website or their online store on Amazon or Flipkart. But this information cannot be had by the publisher in real time for offline sales, unless the shop or outlet where the book is sold has a POS system with a barcode reader which scans the ISBN at every sale and sales data is shared in real-time all the way back to the sub-distributor, the distributor, and the publisher. This would need an ERP solution linking the entire supply chain which is not possible in India as most retail book stores are small businesses without POS systems. Due to this, for offline sales, even the biggest pan-Indian distributors would not be able to provide real-time data on sales to the publisher. Distributors in India take books on credit and usually work with a three-month or six-month payment cycle and the model is sale or return. The distributors provide an update once a month on the *estimated sales*. Even for online sales, the situation becomes complex though when a publisher goes through a distributor who also sells online on Amazon or Flipkart, and the sellers the distributor goes to also sell it online on the same websites. Then you may have a scenario where the same book is available from 25 different sellers on Amazon including the publisher. Each seller gets data in real time but that are not shared in real time with the distributor and the publisher.

  

There are other sides of the story too where it is the publisher at the receiving end. Distributors take advantage of small publishers by charging fixed distribution costs in addition to a percentage of sales volume. Those fixed distribution costs may not make a difference if the book turns out to be a bestseller, but if it is a flop, it can eat into the entire profit margin of the publisher. This is still okay as the publisher knows it is taking a risk with every book. What really hits the publisher is piracy. It starts like this. A publisher asks a printer to print 5000 copies and send a PDF. The printer, sensing a bestseller at hand, prints 5000 additional low quality copies on cheap paper (‘sasta maal’) and book goes into the the black market which is quite big, by some estimates around 20 to 25% of books are pirated. International bestsellers are sold by poor minor children in Mumbai in local trains and at traffic signals. These are the famed book boys of Mumbai, on whom the New York Times had an [article](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/06/books/review/the-book-boys-of-mumbai.html) not long ago. Welcome to the maze of Karma.

  

In addition to hoping that a potential bestseller is not pirated, the best option for a small Indian publisher with low volumes (4-5 books sold a day across all titles) is to not go through a distributor and sell books online on Amazon or Flipkart where the retailer margins are lower, payment cycle is weekly, and the publisher comes to know instantly when a book is sold. Online selling is where Indological and religious publishers in India need to grow in the future.

  

Options for authors in India are limited. In the genre of fiction (where there is enough money), there are literary agents who may work with new authors and help them get a new deal. But academic publishing is a different ball game. Many academic publishers do not pay anything to authors. Some offer a fixed percentage royalty after the copies have been sold out. Some offer nothing if the sales are less than say 1000 copies, and a fixed amount after that. There are no guarantees on the publisher being honest with the author in terms of books sold. Which is bad, but at least the author does not take a financial risk. As they say in my industry: low risk, low reward.
