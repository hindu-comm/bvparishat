Dear Scholars,

  

I cane across the following paper which investigates (and validates) the foundation postulates of Ayurveda. I am neither a scholar of Ayurveda nor of modern medicine. But as a general follower of scientific methods and as a staunch supporter of such methods to understand Indian knowledge traditions I found the article interesting.

Thanks

RN Iyengar

## Abstract

The practice of*Ayurveda*, the traditional medicine of India, is based on the concept of three major constitutional types (Vata, Pitta and Kapha) defined as “*Prakriti*”. To the best of our knowledge, no study has convincingly correlated genomic variations with the classification of*Prakriti.*In the present study, we performed genome-wide SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) analysis (Affymetrix, 6.0) of 262 well-classified male individuals (after screening 3416 subjects) belonging to three*Prakritis.*We found 52 SNPs (*p* ≤ 1 × 10−5) were significantly different between*Prakritis*, without any confounding effect of stratification, after 106permutations. Principal component analysis (PCA) of these SNPs classified 262 individuals into their respective groups (Vata, Pitta and Kapha) irrespective of their ancestry, which represent its power in categorization. We further validated our finding with 297 Indian population samples with known ancestry. Subsequently, we found that*PGM1*correlates with phenotype of Pitta as described in the ancient text of Caraka Samhita, suggesting that the phenotypic classification of India’s traditional medicine has a genetic basis; and its*Prakriti*-based practice in vogue for many centuries resonates with personalized medicine.
