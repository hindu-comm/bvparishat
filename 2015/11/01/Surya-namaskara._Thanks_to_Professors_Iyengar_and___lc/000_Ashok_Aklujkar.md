Two very helpful posts today from Prof. R.N. Iyengar and Prof. Subrahmanyam Korada â€” posts which also serve as models of humility and open-mindedness.  
  
I am also happy to see the rise in the general standard of the list due to the participation of several old and new scholars. Let us keep it up!
