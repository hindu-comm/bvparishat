\>From my understanding, I would claffify Savitar as the (hv) the energy of activation required to effect the specific transformation.  

\>Yes, Vedic sages recognized it and termed as "savitar" but it is the Science that is utilizing it for all advancements. Just gloating on yesteryear's does not help anyone.



------- Dear Dr Moharir,



I did not intend to pitch the Vedas against science, I did not claim any superiority of the Vedas over science.



Gloating or not gloating over yesteryears or the present years was not part of any of my posts; in fact any such expression was beyond the scope of the thread's original question or my posts in answer to that question.



Yes, as a general point of observation, I find no reason to disagree with your statement "All knowledge is useless if it is not understood, utilized, and not accessible at the time of need"



Coming back to the original question, the function of Sandhyavandanam is a subjective, inward looking , process of the organism focussing on itsSavitr (inner energy being one ofthe things close to it) andgetting absorbed in the feel of its Savitr.Viniyoga of such a process of focussing, getting absorbed etc. can be studied using the tools of the scientific field (psychology, neurology etc.)relevant to such a process.
