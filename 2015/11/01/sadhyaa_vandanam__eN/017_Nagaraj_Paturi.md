In my starting post in this thread, I described Savitr as the one within and outside the being.



Now, let me elaborate the 'outside the being'aspect of Savitr:



In its 'outside the being' aspect, Savitr is the life-generating and life-activity-inspiring aspect of the Sun.



In fact, this aspect of the Vedic concept Savitr/Savitaa is so well established that the word Savitr/Savitaa isused as a synonym for the Sanskrit words referring to the Sun.



Belief in the role of the Sun as a fertilizer, ,is so widespread that many fertility worshipping rituals and cultures are centred around the Sun in different parts of the world.



Role of the Sun in many nutrition and other health aspects of organisms iswell recognized in modern science too.



Role of the Sun in photosynthesis which helps the bottom of the food chain is also now part of common knowledge.



In brief, centrality given to the Sun in the Vedas and theVedic lore is now well supported by the understandings in modern science too.



Gaayatree japa, which is one of the core rituals of Sandhyaavandanam,in its aspect as a meditation on the life-generating and life-activity-inspiring aspect of the Sun is well supported by contemporary understanding.
