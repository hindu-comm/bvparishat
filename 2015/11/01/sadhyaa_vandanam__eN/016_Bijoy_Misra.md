Dear Dr Moharir,  

While your question is valid, I urge you to try out to experiment.
Please don't take anything accepted  

but feel that energy. I won't go into more details but would recommend you to get into the modern  

literature of neuro-science to understand intentionality. It is a new term coming from psychology.  

Once you study, many of your questions might resolve through the modern findings. More you  

would learn by practicing!  

Best regards,  

Bijoy Misra  

Boston.
