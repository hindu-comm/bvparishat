Sir

  

In the Arthasangraha, a prakaranagrantha of Mimamsa, the discussion of Sandhyavandanam occurs under the Adhikaravidhi:

  

कर्मजन्यफलस्वाम्यबोधको विधिरधिकारविधिः। कर्मजन्यफलस्वाम्यं कर्मजन्यफलभोक्तृत्वम्। स च "यजेत स्वर्गकामः" इत्यादिरूपः। स्वर्गमुद्दिश्य यागं विदधतानेन स्वर्गकामस्य यागजन्यफलभोक्तृत्वं प्रतिपाद्यते। . . . एवं "अहरहः सन्ध्यामुपासीत" इत्यादिना शुचिविहितकालजीविनः सन्ध्योपासनजन्यप्रत्यवायपरिहाररूपफलस्वाम्यं बोध्यते॥

तच्च फलस्वाम्यं तस्यैव योऽधिकारविशिष्टः। अधिकारश्च स एव यद्विधिवाक्येषु पुरुषविशेणत्वेन श्रूयते। यथा . . . नित्ये सन्ध्योपासनादौ शुचिविहितकालजीवित्वम्।

  

While it is clear that the Mimamsa position is that the fruit, and hence purpose, of Sandhyavandanam is pratyavaayaparihaara (more about this later), the quality prescribed for the Adhikaari, (the one who enjoys this fruit) - शुचिविहितकालजीवित्वम् - offers an important clue. Firstly, it imposes Saucam (bathing in the morning and evening) and then provides the anchor around which the daily life is woven: start early and come back home by sunset, sparing five or ten minutes at beginning and ending of the day to focus on the Pratyaksha-naarayaNa: the Sun (असावादित्यो ब्रह्म).

  

The multiplier effect of discipline is difficult to over-emphasise. Many people wonder how Vedic scholars or even traditional scholars remember such a huge amount of corpus. Often it is attributed to superior intelligence - but discipline is under-rated. These scholars repeat every text segment at least a hundred times (ten aavrittis, each consisting of ten repititions) for one or two weeks and then recite it at least once a month (svaadhyaaya) for a period of forty years (at least that's what the theory is). Those who are not endowed with great Medhasakti also can retain huge amounts of text if this kind of discipline is followed. Even for those not interested in memorizing vast texts, this discipline is useful. For instance, let us say one wants to recite the entire Ramayanam. Often the start is bright but then the intent fizzles down. In many cases the task is not completed - especially when it is not publicly declared and there is nobody asking whether the task is completed or not. On the other hand, if one makes a small rule - say that one would recite at least one sarga (or more if possible) every day after Sandhyavandanam, the task gets completed. Thus vihitakaalajeevitvam, is one great benefit. It is like why there are set office hours. (To be sure, this should not be read as the Mimamsa position, for they would not admit an unseen benefit if a seen benefit is sufficient).

  

Now, coming to the question of Pratyavaaya, this is like non-payment of interest, or not repaying a debt. Rishis with great tapas achieved the eligibility to see the various mantras and then through the unbroken chain of teachers passed these onto us, out of great compassion. We are indebted to our teachers and Rishis and have to repay this debt by keeping that knowledge alive and failure to repay this debt is what may be considered as Pratyavaaya.
