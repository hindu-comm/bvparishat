Dear Dr Moharir,



1\.

**This paragraph totally confusing for me, specifically, "*****savitr =generator of dheeh = physical andbeyond physical (mental, spiritual etc. )*" AND "*****Tuning back the system that tends to go out of tune of the generator from time to time.* ".**

**Kindly Elaborate**

**  
**

Savitr is taken in the sense of Prasavitr by authorities such as SaayaNa too**.**

**  
**

Prasav = to give birth to , is well known.

**  
**

I used the word 'generate' in that sense. That is how savitaa =generator

**  
**

For dheeh, I wrote "dheeh = physical andbeyond physical (mental, spiritual etc. ) *faculties*" ; you missed to copy the word faculties.

  

SaayaNa takes the word dhiyah in the sense of karmaaNi = activities. karmaaNi are s'aarIraka karmaaNi, maanasika karmaaNi etc.

  

In the verse, योदेव स्सवितास्माकं also, dhiyah is elaborated as dhiyo dharmaadigocharaah ; even SaayaNa takes the meaning dharmaadiroopaah. dharma (property) here is s'arIradharma, manOdharma etc. Combining all this, we get the meaning physical activities (biological processes) mental activities etc. or physical properties, mental properties etc. for dheeh.

  

What is dheemahi ? If Savitr is realized to be an entity inside the meditating person, then the dhyaana on that entity can be realized to be getting tuned to that inner entity. Why do we need to periodically do the dhyaana? The very need to periodical tuning shows that the person gets out of tune( from this inner eternal 'vibration' called Savitr) from time to time.

  

Similar is the case of PraaNaayaama. Why peridical praaNaayaama? Only because the right breathing pattern set in by praaNaayaama gets disturbed by the day to day activities. Incidentally, praaNaayaama is part of Sandhyavandanam in general and gaayatreejapa in particular.

  

2\. maarjana is self-explanatory.

  

3\. Nitya karma is a karma which is not naimittika i.e. a karma done with a purpose. It is not nitya because it is prescribed to be done. It is the other way round. It is prescribed to be done because the prescribing rishi through his tapas discovered that it is nitya. Most of the vidhis of dharmashastra are formalizations of the ideal natural activities of a person sensitive to and attuned to ritam, the natural rhythm of rhythm of rhythms.
