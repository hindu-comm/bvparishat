Dear Dr. Yadu Moharir Ji!

Namaste. Suprabhatam.

Thanks for your compliment or comment that my posts are always full of information.

Yes. There was an intention in giving the sequential details of Sandhyavandna. Before I proceed to explain why I have given the sequential details I would like to concentrating on one or two points of your initial lines of this thread.

(The highlighted lines are from your mail)

Point No.1

Lot of things have been discussed pertaining to"surya namaskaara" and health benefits during "sadhyaa vandanam"  

"Surya Namaskara" associated with health benefits is not a part of Sandhya Vandana. I have given some details of it in my separate post on Surya Namaskara. Those details can be seen there.  

  

Can someone elaborate on why such tradition (sandhyaa vandanam) was introduced as a ritual in the first place by our ancestors ? (no need to repeat the health benefits already discussed).

  

This part of your mail is to be answered:

With an initial ideal that the sequence of the process is self explanatory I have just given the sequence without any Benefit-Taglines.  

  

The other Scholars Dr. Siva Senani Ji and Dr. Nagaraj Paturi Ji have already initiated into the subject regarding its various benefits.

  

I lay down certain causes for placing this by our ancestors in the first of daily rituals to be performed by us.

  

**1. Sandhya Vandana is the Purifier of Antahkaranas ..*****Manas, Buddhi, Ahankara and Chitta.***

 Every day we clean our surroundings. We clean the vessels used on the previous day while taking food. We clean our clothes. We clean our body with Snana. This is the physical cleaning process.

**But where is the occasion to clean the Anthahkaranas?**

That occasion is Sandhaya Vandana.

**Why should we clean them? is the very next question** -

Ape to Super Ape.. Super Ape to Divine ... is the ideal way of Human living.

To make our lives Divine we invite the Gods and Goddesses to dwell in us making our heart the Best of the Elevated Seats available with us.

As we cannot adjust with the impure surroundings the Divine beings also cannot stay in our impure Anthakaranas.

  

So for this purpose the Marjana Mantras, Mantra Achamanam and Aghamarshana Mantras are prescribed:

  

Particularly **t****he Mantrachamana**is a wonderful process of making us sin free if we understand and practice it. It surely sets us free from all Sins.

**  
**

ऒम्. .. सूर्यश्च मा मन्युश्च मन्युपतयश्च मन्यु कृतेभ्य:। पापेभ्यो रक्षन्ताम्। यद्रार्त्रिया पापमकार्षम्। मनसा वाचा हस्ताभ्याम्। पद्भ्यामुदरेण शिश्ना। रात्रिस्तदवलुम्पतु। यत्किञ्च दुरितं मयि। इदमहं मा ममृतयोनौ। सूर्ये ज्योतिषि जुहोमि स्वाहा।  

  

This Mantrachamana is an essential part of all the three Sandhyas. So if having understood this if we perform - by mind, by speech and by all physical limbs we stop doing any kind of sins.

"A SIN FREE HEART is the BEST SEAT FOR THE DIVINITY".

**2. Sandhya Vandana is to Drive away all the Asuri set of qualities from us**

The components of this Process are ***1. Papa Purusha Vimochanam, (Drupadaadiva Munchatu...etc), 2. Arghyapradana with Gayatri Mantra to drive away all the Asuri set of qualities from us 3. Atma Pradakshina
and 4. Tarpanam***. This process is of different lengths according to the respective traditions.

  

**3. Sandhayavandana is the Intellectual Invigorating and Stimulating Process:**

This Process includes:***1. Gayatri Avaahana, 2. Gayatri Japasankalpa, 3. Karanyasa, 4. Anga nyasa 5. Dhyana Shloka and 6. Japavidhi***.

This is the most essential part of Sandhyavandana through which the Savitr Devata graces us to unite our Intellect with the Path of Dharma and other Purusharthas to lead a pious, ideal and virtuous life.

  

यो देवस्सविताऽस्माकं धियो धर्मादिगोचरा:।

प्रेरयेत् तस्य यद्भर्गस्तद्वरेण्यमुपास्महे ॥

  

**4. Sandhya Vandana is to Express our ever Indebtedness to the Gods, Rshis and Manes (Pitr Devatas) for giving us this rarest birth among Human beings**:  

After the Gayatri Japavidhi the process of **Suryopasthanam** is prescribed: This consists of 1. Expressing our Devotion to The Sun, 2. Dig-Devata Namaskara 3. Rshi-Pitr Namaskara with Gotra Pravaras. This process is to express our Gratitude to the Gods, Rshis and Pitr Devatas for providing us to have a this rarest opportunity to be born as Human beings.

  

**5. Sandhayavandanam is to offer our Devotion to All the Gods and Goddesses of our respective Family Traditions**:

  

This is the closing Part of Sandhyavandana to offer Namaskarams to all the Gods and Goddesses of our respective Family Traditions. Here all our expectations such as Fulfillment of Purusharthas, Klesha Nasa, Sukha Jivana, Sampadvriddhi, Vamsha Vriddhi, Vidyavrddhi etc. from those gods are enlisted and finally the Sandhyavandana closes with Mangalasasanam.

  

**6. Ultimately Sandhayavandana is to attain Sakala Srauta - Smartha Karmacharana Yogyataa Praapti**:

This is the consolidation of all the above five purposes:

When our Antahkaranas are purified the Godsis seated in our hearts.

They bestow upon us the awakened, stimulated and invigorated intellect.

With such intellect if we express our Gratitude to all the Deities they bless us to be spiritually strong enough to perform any and every other kind of Srauta Karmas and Smartha Karmas for attaining different worldly benefits.

  

There can be many other supplementary benefits and also other scientific reasons which are being explained by the rest of the scholars of this forum.

I hope this mail of mine may satisfy at least a part of your question of this thread.

Regards,

**Dr. Rani Sadasiva Murty**
