I can take the opportunity of explaining a Kind of Smarta Sandhayavandana prevalent in Andhra Pradesh particularly in our family tradition of Apasthmabha Sutra of Krishna Yajurveda Sakha.

The following are the usual components of it:

1. 24 Keshava Namas

2. Bhutocchatana Mantra

3. Sankalpa

4\. Pranayama

5\. Marjanam

6\. Aghamarshana Mantras:

   a. Pratas sandhya and Madhyahna Sandhya : Praying to the Sun to make free

     the meditating person free from all the sins committed during the previous           night and till the Noon

       

   b. Sayam Sandhya Praying to the Agni to make free the meditating person from 

      all the sins committed during the day.

7\. 24 Keshava Namas

8\. Marjanam

9\. Salutations to the Sun considering him as the Parabrahma and

   Tarpanam Nava grahas and the Goddesses Savitri, Gayatri and Sarsvati

10\. 7. 24 Keshava Namas

11\. Gayatrhi Avahanam to be seated in the heart of the worshiper 

12\. Again Pranayama

13\. Karnanyasa, Anga Nyasa and Mudras

14\. Gayatrhi Dhyana Sloka

15\. Gayathri Manthra Japa

17\. Gayathri Udvasana

18. Suryopasthana

19\. Prayers to all the chosen Gods and Goddesses to bless with the purushartha siddhi

20\. Keshava namas and Mangala Shlokas.

  

This is the usual sequence of Sandhya Vandana which we perform in our tradition.
