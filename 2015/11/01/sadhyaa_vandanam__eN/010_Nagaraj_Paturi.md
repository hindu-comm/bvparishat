Now, let me bring some science into the discussion on Savitr as an inner generating/driving entity inside the living organism:



1\. Did Wohler's synthesis disprove that organisms can produce organic compounds by themselves? In fact, he could only prove that what is beingsynthesized in a laboratory using a hugeelaborate process is getting generated inside the organism.Who is playing the role of the scientistthat synthesizes the compound, inside the body of the living organism?



2\. What is the source inside the body of the living organismfrom whereits self-healing process starts ?



3\. Newton's laws of motion do not apply to a living body. No 'external force' is required for the body to move from rest to motion or back or to change the direction of motion. What is the source inside the body of the living organismfor the processes that help the living body to move from rest to motion or back or to changeits direction of motion all by itself.



Many other such questions when pondered over, help understand thatthere is an inner generating/driving entity inside the living organism. The beautiful Vedic word for it is Savitr.
