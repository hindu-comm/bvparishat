Dharma is universal not restricted to practice or rituals of a group or community. Its applicability is for all mankind Arjuna was just an excuse. Any way that's not within the scope of this thread. I made this mark in to highlight one may not find the word 'Sanatana Dharma' what it normally denotes now in the Vedas or early texts. Sandhya Vandana need not be linked to Santana Dharma what it denotes now.

न जायते म्रियते वा कदाचिन्नायं भूत्वा भविता वा न भूयः।  
अजो नित्यः शाश्वतोऽयं पुराणो न हन्यते हन्यमाने शरीरे।।2.20।।
