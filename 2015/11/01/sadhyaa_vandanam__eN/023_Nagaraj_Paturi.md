1\. The root of the problem is in the use of the word 'dharma' in Hindi and other contemporary north Indian languages as a translation for the English word 'religion'. The word 'sanaatana dharma' if used with this sense of the word 'dharma', then translates into 'eternal religion'. Since the connotation of the English word does not allow it to be eternal, the word sanaatana dharma appears to have a problem.



2\. The word 'sanaatana dharma' has been used as a problem-free alternative for the problematic word 'Hinduism' in modern discourse. Since this usage appears in modern discourses only, the word itself appears to be neologism which it is not.



3\. After the reformation movements such as Arya Samaj, the word 'Sanaatani' came to meanthings like 'superstitious of the Hindus' 'opposed to rational understanding of Hinduism'etc.



4\. The word 'sanaatana dharma' has been used to articulate the distinction of Hinduism as against book-based , prophet-based religions.



All these modern usages create an impression that the word is a modern coinage whereas the modern usages of the word areonly modern and not the word itself.
