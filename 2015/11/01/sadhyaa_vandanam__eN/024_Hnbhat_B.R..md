All the quoted verses quote "this is the eternal Dharma" and does not define any particular Dharma in common ad सनातनधर्म as already pointed out by Prof. Korada. And not defining a common धर्म as सनातनधर्म or nor defining the nature of धर्म as I can understand the quoted verses including the recent ones posted by Sunil Bhattacharya.

That is why Prof. Korada stated he could not trace the origin of the word popular as सनातनधर्म.

Thus the question turns out do we follow all the धर्म called as एष धर्मः सनातनः or any of the eternal धर्म defined in any of quoted verses?

It is declared

 "वेदो’खिलो धर्ममूलम् " - गौतमस्मृतिः/ मनुस्मृतिः ।

महाभारत has this quotion

तर्कोऽप्रतिष्ठः श्रुतयो विभिन्नाः नासौ ऋषिर्यस्य मतं न भिन्नम् \|  
धर्मस्य तत्त्वं निहितं गुहायां महाजनो येन गतः स पन्थः \|\|

quoted as the words of Dharmaraja in reply to the questions of Yaksha. I could not right now give the reference to Mahabharata.

Again, Mahabharata **Book 12 शान्तिपर्व**  
**Chapter 37** says

अदत्तस्यानुपादानं दानमध्ययनं तपः \|  
अहिंसा सत्यमक्रोधः क्षमेज्या धर्मलक्षणम् \|\|७\|\|

य एव धर्मः सोऽधर्मोऽदेशेऽकाले प्रतिष्ठितः \|  
आदानमनृतं हिंसा धर्मो व्यावस्थिकः स्मृतः \|\|८\|\|
