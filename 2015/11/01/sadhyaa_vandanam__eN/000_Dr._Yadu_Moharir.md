Respected scholars,

  

Lot of things have been discussed pertaining to "surya namaskaara" and health benefits during "sadhyaa vandanam"  

  

Can someone elaborate on why such tradition (sandhyaa vandanam) was introduced as a ritual in the first place by our ancestors ? (no need to repeat the health benefits already discussed).

  

Thanks in advance

  

Dr Yadu
