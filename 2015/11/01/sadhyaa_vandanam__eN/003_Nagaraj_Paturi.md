\> Can someone elaborate on why such tradition (sandhyaa vandanam) was introduced as a ritual in the first place by our ancestors ?



1. What is called as Sandhyaavandanam is not in fact a single ritual. It is a combination of several different rituals. Hence the explanation of purpose or function or use of Sandhyaavandanam can be only in the form of the different rituals that make what is called as Sandhyaavandanam.



2. One of the core /central ritualsof this ritual-complex is Gaayatreejapa. The meaning of the Gaayatreemantra itself explains purpose or function or use ofGaayatreejapa. The purpose or function is to pay attention to and get absorbed inthe savitr =generator of dheeh = physical andbeyond physical (mental, spiritual etc. ) faculties. The generatorwithin and outside thebeing.Tuning back the system that tends to go out of tune of the generator from time to time.



3. The other components such as maarjana, if you see the mantras used become self-explanatory. The mantras describe, among other things, thecleansing of the waters by golden sun rays (hiraNyavarNaass'uchayaa yaas'cha paavakaah) and in turn cleansing of body and mind by the waters so cleaned.



4. Arghya to Surya is an expression of giving back to the Sun whogives us (what? need not be detailed)



5.Similarly other components such as namaskaaras to directions etc. can be explained.



6. Pratyavaaya is because of the karma being nitya. Nitya is natural. A natural tendency of the being is formalized through ritual. Pratyavaaya is the pain of deviating from the nitya, natural.
