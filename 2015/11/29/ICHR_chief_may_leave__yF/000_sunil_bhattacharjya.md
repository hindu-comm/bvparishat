Dear friends,  
  

There is a news report in the Indian express that The ICHR chief, Yellapragada Sudershan Rao, has offered to resign as the Government finds him not aggressive enough to handle the ongoing and possible fight with Left-leaning historians.  
  
Let us hope that if Prof Rao is given another chance, he should form a group of aggressive scholars (not necessarily the academic historians alone) and challenge head on, the left-leaning historians, who are trying to perpetuate historical lies about the ancient Indian history. Love for the historical truths and the abiilty to search for the historical truth, are not necessarily the birth-right of the academic historians. It should be multi-disciplined, including the open-minded academic historians.  
  

Regards,  

Sunil KB
