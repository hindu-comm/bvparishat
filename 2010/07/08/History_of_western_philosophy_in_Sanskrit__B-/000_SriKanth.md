Respected Sirs,  
  
I came across this book Paschatyatattva Sastratihas by P. Sri  
Ramachandrudu (<http://www.vedicbooks.net/paschatyatattva-sastratihas->  
p-3959.html).  
  
I am intrigued by the idea of writing a book on Western philosophy in  
Sanskrit as the other way of writing english books on Indian  
philosophy is more common.  
  
I tried buying that book but it seems out of print. I am eager to  
contact the author but don't know how.  
  
Dhanyavada:  
Srikanthan Krishnamachari.
