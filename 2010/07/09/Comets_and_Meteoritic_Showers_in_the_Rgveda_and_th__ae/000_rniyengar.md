Dear Members  
Namaste!  
  
The above paper was published recently in the Indian Journal of  
History of Science.  
  
Abstract  
The possibility of some transient celestial object being described by  
the word  
dhūmaketu in the Rgveda is studied in this paper. It is found that  
the well known  
Vedic deities, maruts through their physical actions stand for  
meteoritic showers or  
storms. In some places the description reads like extra terrestrial  
objects hitting the  
earth. This goes against the traditional interpretation of maruts as  
thunderstorm and  
wind gods. It is demonstrated that vibhāvasu also stands for a  
transient object in the  
sky, which in one place in the Rgveda is said to be like a big rock.  
Importance of the  
above results for tracing the early history of Indian Astronomy is  
highlighted. Ancient  
Vedic people appear to have been preoccupied with celestial fires in  
the form of  
meteoritic swarms and comets which would have necessitated regular  
ritualistic  
observation of the sky, gradually leading to the calendar and later to  
the knowledge of  
the planets.
