Jaya Guru Datta  
We are extremely pleased to invite you for the Veda Havana Maha Yaaga (Rigveda, Yajurveda and Samaveda) conducted at Mysore Ashrama with the Blessings of Sri Ganapati Sachchidananda Swamiji. As you might be aware, Veda Havana involves chanting all the Mantras of each Veda and offering an Aahuti to their respective deities.  
  
It is an elaborate ritual for the well being of the reciter, listener, sponsor and society at large.  
**  
This activity is conducted as part of Silver Jubilee Celebrations of SGS Veda Pathasala, Mysore of Avadhoota Datta Peetham.
