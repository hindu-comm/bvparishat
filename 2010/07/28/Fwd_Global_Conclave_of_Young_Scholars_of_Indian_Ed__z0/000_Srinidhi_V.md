Subject: Global Conclave of Young Scholars of Indian Education (January 27-29, 2011)  
  
  
Dear Sir/Madam  
  
Our University is organizing a Global Conclave of Young Scholars working on Indian Education in January, 2011. The main purpose of the Conclave is to offer a platform for young scholars working on any aspect
of Indian education to come together, to share and to showcase their research. It is found that while very large number of scholars in universities and research institutions in different countries are engaged in research on Indian education, there is no common forum in which Indian scholars and scholars of Indian education from outside can come together and engage in exchange of ideas.  
The purpose of the Conclave would, therefore, be to give a unique opportunity for doctoral and post doctoral researchers and early career faculty to interact with their peer group from different parts of the world and share their research findings.  
  
I am enclosing material related to the Conference. I shall be grateful if you could give wide publicity to the Conference in your
University/Institution. You may feel free to circulate the mail among your network of friends and colleagues and other institutes of similar interest across the world. It would be great if you can kindly upload
information about the Conclave on your institute/network website {<http://nuepa.org/GlobalConclaveoneducation/Index.html>}.  
  
A line in confirmation is highly appreciated.  
  
Thanking you in advance for your cooperation.  
  
With regards  
  
Yours sincerely
