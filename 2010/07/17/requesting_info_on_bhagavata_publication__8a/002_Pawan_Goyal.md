**Namaste,  
  
I am referring you to the most widely read edition of Srimad Bhagavatam throughout the world, in case you are not aware of that.  
  
<http://catalog.bbt.info/d_show_book.php?id=58&target_language=English>  
  
**This work is the product of the scholarly and devotional effort of His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, the world’s most distinguished teacher of Indian religious and philosophical thought.  
  
The Srimad Bahagavatam set is available in English as well as Hindi languages (should be available in the nearest ISKCON centres.)  
  
With Regards
