Dear vidvadvrinda,

Thanks a lot for your enlightening discussion and ample information. In fact I read in the MBh. that the diseases of body and mind are inter-related. If any one of them is disturbed the other is also disturbed and becomes ill. So I am trying to co-relate the malfunctioning of the chakras and diseases. I have some hypothesis in this connection, but I want some shastric proof from some tantras to corroborate and establish it. So I requested the scholarly world to provide information about chakras. Thanks to everyone, who contributed in this discussion.

With regards,

Dr. Mrs.Rajkumari Trikha
