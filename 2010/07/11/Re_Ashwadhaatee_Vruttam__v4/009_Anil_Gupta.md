Respected sir,  
  
kindly see this link  
  
<http://sanskrit.nic.in/dhatu/dhaturatnakara.htm>  
  
Here you can see the all the verb-forms for 10 lakaras with the dhatu-meaning and other dhatu informations.  
It works only in MICROSOFT INTERNET EXPLORER browser. For first time it installs some plugins automatically on your machine and then it works very nice.  
  
This is a huge work which is done on Dhaturatnakara (Only 1st ,2nd and 3rd parts) by Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan, New Delhi in 2000 with the collaboration of Rashtriya Sanskrit Vidyapeetha, Tirupati.
