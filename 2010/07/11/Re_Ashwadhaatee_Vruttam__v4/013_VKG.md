Pranaam  
We agree that BVP is an excellent forum to bring scholars across the  
nation. The name is also very apt, as it is just an affiliation to  
scholarship of Bhaarata (no other institution).

A forum by academics, for the academics.

Let us hope that we will be conversant in Deva Bhasha sooner, across  
all the media.

Regards  
Vamshi
