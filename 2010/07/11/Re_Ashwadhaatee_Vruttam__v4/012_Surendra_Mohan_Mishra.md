**Esteemed Colleagues,  
  
Grateful to Dr Jagannathji for his kind compliments which I don't deserve so much.A great tradition we are leaving behind which has to offer us and our contemporary world of knowledge highly rich and valuable resources.The Sanskrit prosody is the best so far in the world classical and contemporary literature.The evolution of ideas and idioms is simply marvellous.You feel immediately touched by that core Indianness !  
  
The BVP deserves tributes to have created a forum to give vent to further thoughts on aspects of shAstra-s.What we are supposed to carry out is sampradAya-rakshA and sampradAya-vriddhi.  
  
I note this as partial correction of what I mailed in haste :  
  
1) The first new metre suggested by me is of 25 syllables per quarter thus running into a century of syllables in the process.What Dr Jagannathji is telling is well taken.Perhaps in chanting 'tagaNa' added to ashvadhATI in the beginning may make better melody,but I tried 'magaNa' and was all right.I also thought 'magaNa' to be there to complete the presence of all the accepted gaNa-s in the holistic metre.  
  
2) If not 'shatadalam' etc. names then the names offered as closely resembling and yet suggesting that 'extra' over ashvaghATI with the use of 'pra' prefix or with prefixing 'sura' to the name 'ashvaghATI' should do.Or else we can think of some name like 'paNchavimshAksharam' etc.  
  
3) The second metre I suggested with 27 letters in each quarter would make a total of 108 syllables,this no. like 100 is very significant.I have prefixed the suggested name with "mahA" to refer to it's length as surpassing 'ashvadhATI' and 'surAshvadhATI'.But therewith I have mentioned 'shatadalam' etc which is mistaken,as there are 108 syllables and not 100.  
  
But again I pray esteemed friends equipped with more sensitive ears and speech to judge it's suitability to tone,chanting and scales in music.If we land up at a metre offering 108 syllables to be put through our vocal chord calling for control over elongation of prANa breathing,something corresponding to the psycho-linguistic aspects entailing greater joy and divine moments !  
  
Or I don't know and shouldn't know ! Our tradition lays more emphasis on art (the how and what)more than science(the cause-effect based why).Every part of our great country has peculiar chanting techniques.  
  
Last day I was a little religiously at the tv on the sacred day of GuNDichA festival at Puri,serenely listening to some special Odia ways of reciting a shloka.In this connection I'm so deighted to find a verse mailed by Er Narayanji paying obeisance to Lord Jagannatha.I wish he earn that apUrva having done this on that auspicious day.  
  
I also wished that the running commentary on the occasion at Puri should have been in Sanskrit for at least an hour ! The same thing I wished during the recent Kumbha at Haridwar ! Someday someone will care !  
  
Very warm regards.
