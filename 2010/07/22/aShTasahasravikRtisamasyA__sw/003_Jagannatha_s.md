Dear sir,



Only the books were deteriorating Ramayana some decades ago. Now TV channels have started totwist the story according their own will and wish. Ninty percent of Valmiki Ramayana is logical. Some stories are, no doubt,illogical. But they invite discussion and never give permission to convolute the story. Ramayana ofperverted versions arecreated by the mentality ofsectarian fanaticism, childishness, and strange logic.THE SAMSKRITA VALIMIKI RAMAYANA IS CREATED BY DIGNIFIED LEVEL OF MINDSET.The description of war is simply superb. These duplicate Valimikis think that , since, the Valmiki Ramayana is not based on logicality, they can weave stories based on pure logic. But their duplicate Ramayanas have equally question-generating stories based oninconsequence!

How long we, the citizens of India shall tolerate pervertingactivities of Ramayana story?

We have to take Samskrita Valmiki Ramayana AS IT IS. If we have questions regarding interpolations and versions,let us discuss. We shall stop creating nonsensical absurdities in the name of, Modern thinking.



There are thousands of opportunities to apply individuals' life and
views in short stories, novels, poems, essays and even separate books of rationalism. Every citizen is free to blame even Valmiki for showing partiality to some roles. For this purpose one does not need tomake विकृत Ramayanas.

There is a novel A. I personally don't like someparts of that novel. Shall I discussthose parts or create novel B, a changed version, utilizing thename of the novel A withthe same names of roles?
