So many Ramayanas, different from Valmiki Ramayana have become signposts of our cultural identity. For example, Torave Ramayana by Torave Narahari (or Kumara Valmiki) is taken for Gamaka style of presentation even today. But it is time to stop writing new Torave Ramayanas. By writing newTorave Ramayana, we are losing Valmiki. In modern day scenario, so many Ramayanas are seen by viewers in the channels. They get confused. Ramananda Sagar's Ramayana was based on Tulasi plus his own imagination.There is no proof that he studied so many Ramayanas in different languages. He claimed that he had depended upon even Kannada Ramayana. But that is unbelievable. First of all, we are not sure whether he knows Kannada. Secondly, he mentioned Ramachandracharitapurana and not well known Torave Ramayana. That means he did not know Kannada. I surmise that if he had not mentioned Kannada Ramayana, the Kannada people would have felt angry. That's why he mentioned a Kannada Ramayana which is not popular. This may be the case with even other Ramayanas. Valmiki's Sanskrit Ramayana is not only rich in energetic language but also in technical detail like that of war. It is because of so many Ramayanas prevailing, day by day, the number of the readers of Samskrita Valmiki Ramayana is diminishing.
