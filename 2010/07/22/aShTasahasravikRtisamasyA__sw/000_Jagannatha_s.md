Dear friends, you may exclaim ‘‘Oh! what is this, is there any typo in it? It shall be only अष्टविकृति (of Vedas) and not अष्टसहस्रविकृति ’’

No. There is no typing error. It IS अष्टसहस्रविकृति and not अष्टविकृति. Please read this.



Sita does not go with Rama to the forest. Instead she lives very much in Ayodhya. Unnecessarily she pokes her nose in the official
transactions of Bharata. Bharata feels angry and banishes Sita from Ayodhya.

Tataka is in love with Valin. When Valin resorts to Srirama and pleaded to free him from clutches of Tataka, Rama shoots an arrow making Tataka target. But unfortunately the arrow gets missed the target and hits Valin. As a result, Valin dies.



It is Urmila who is kidnapped by Ravana and not Sita.



Hanuman does not fly. He sits on the back of Mainaka who assumes human form and swims across the sea.



Some Rakshasas are bribed by Jambavant and they join Raama’s army.

Hanuman has five tails. He hits Kumbhakarna with his fourth tail. That’s why Kumbhakarna becomes weak and could be slain easily by Rama.



These wonderful(?),logical(?!)and very practical(???!!!)stories are in my own जगन्नाथरामायण.



How beautiful! (I am sorry, I do not know your reaction. So I am patting myself on my shoulders.)



Nobody will ask me that why I am unnecessarily deteriorating an आर्षकाव्य. Nobody will shout that I shall be punished. I won't be put into jail for insulting the literature which is interwoven in our culture. Instead, I will be praised!



There is no dearth of publishers in our country to publish this
Ramayana. I am hundred percent sure that I will have applause from every nook and corner of our country. Of course, there may be a few exceptions.



It is possible to create a new novel or a new poem to document my views regarding the modern society . Instead of doing that, what is the necessity to deteriorate an Arshakavya ?

I have definite answer for this query:



If I will write a novel or short story I won’t be very famous. Winning Sahitya Academy award is not easy. Most important thing is I have to struggle for publishing my new novel.



If I will create a childish work of inferior level using the names occurred in Ramayana,

1. The people will purchase my work rapidly and I can fill my pocket easily.

2. I will be conferred Sahitya Academy award.

3. There is every possibility that some seminars will be arranged and the ones who even once have not read the Valmiki Ramayana will present papers. In that seminar, almost all the paper presenters blame Valmiki Ramayana as impractical as well unnatural and mine is the best among the अष्टसहस्रविकृतिरामायणs. Who knows, in near future, जगन्नाथरामायण will
be taken for Ph.D. by research students who will have completed their language MA.

Some suggested titles for Ph.D thesis: 1.जगन्नाथरामायण and its impact on the society. A socio-psycho-analysis.

2. A comparative study of जगन्नाथरामायण and other Ramayanas of Asia.

3.A comparative analysis of जगन्नाथरामायण with special reference to its logicality in story narrating.



So dear friends, congratulate me in advance.

Your congratulations will encourage me to create जगन्नाथभारत.
