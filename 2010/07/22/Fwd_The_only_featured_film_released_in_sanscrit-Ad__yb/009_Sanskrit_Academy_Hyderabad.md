Dear Prof. PAnchamukhiJi and other scholars,



After going through the responses on this subject line, i remembered you(ThenDr.VR.Panchamukhiji was chancellor of RSV,Tpt) telling the importance of such modern mediums for the life of Sanskrit. Yes...as it was pointed out, no much encouragementwas received by entrepreneurs (like GVI)who tried to promote Sanskrit through films and other mediums. There was a poor response by even Sanskrit scholars and institutions. Iwitnessed this in Bangalore when the premier shows were arranged for Bhagavadgita film in Sanskrit,



The universities can NOT undertake projects to produce films aseither they donot have competence or theywillface threatening of losing their focus on education and research.



NGO's and professional non-commercial film producers must come fowardtoproducefilms.To make them attractive, we should add star value byinviting contemporary super stars. Government may come up with some plans / spl grants for production of such films.



The question is Who will bell the CAT?



regards,

shrivara
