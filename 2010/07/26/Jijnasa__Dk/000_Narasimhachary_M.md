Dear friends: This is a question raised by a student of mine. What is the name of King Raghu's wife? It is not mentioned anywhere by Kalidasa. He uses the word *Devi* to refer to his wife, which is of course a common term. I shall be grateful if anybody can throw light on this.  
  
Narasimhacharya, M.
