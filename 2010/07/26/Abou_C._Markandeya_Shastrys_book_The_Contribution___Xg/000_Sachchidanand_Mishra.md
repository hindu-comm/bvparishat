Dear Scholars,  
I am again posing the same question if anybody knows of C. Markandeya  
Shastry's book "The Contribution of Sureshvaracharya to Advaita  
Philosophy". I have been in search of this book for a long time. Last  
time when I posted this question to this forum, soon after came a  
reply but when I consulted the person she regretted that confusingly  
she admitted but she did not have the abovementioned book.  
If anyone has seen this book in any library, kindly tell me.  
With regards
