Dear sir/madam,

There was a poet geniusnamelyVaradakrishnamacharya in the last century. He authored a marvelous literary piece namely BhAratakhaDgaah. In this, MahAbhArata story is narratedusing a very strange metre. Broadly one can surmise that the name of this metre is KhaDga, after the title. I have not come across any metre having this name. The metre is of MAtrAgaNa and not AkSharagaNa. The most attractive part of this poem isrhyme-flood of second letterin all the three pars of eight lines.(Every verse has nine lines). Altogether, same letter gets repeated 24 times in one single verse! Yati is not applied.

I have seen only 86 verses of the same. KIchakavadha is the last story in the portion available to me. The scholars are requested to shed more light on this literary wonder.

I think this small introduction is enough.

Now, Read this and Enjoy!

File of भारतखड्गाः is attached with this post.
