\> I think - ApsarI must have been changed to 'parI'. I did not come across any parI except in Hindi.

The word \`parI' means "fairy" in Farsi and is a loan-word in Hindi. It seems unlikely to be derived from Sanskrit, at least directly. Comparison with Arabic and other languages would be essential.
