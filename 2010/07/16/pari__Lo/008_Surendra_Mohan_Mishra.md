In all languages and dialects stories and fables ought to be there related to fairies.Linguistically the more seeming derivation of 'parI'is of course from 'apsaras' : 'apsaras>apsarA>apsarI(in many vernaculars)>parI.  
In Sanskrit one finds a lot of material.The SimhAsanadvAtrimshikA is one of the best where 32 fairies narrate their tales bringing about the same conclusion.The imaginative character of the Indian mind has always blended myth and reality to create an aesthetic appeal from time to time.  
  
But in our concept of cosmogony and in our concept of alien beings Apsaras are an extra-terrestrial tribe,benevolent or malevolent they influence life on earth and elsewhere.They are considered as a type of Devayoni-s(see Amara,Svargavarga).  
  
In Brahmanic and Shramanic traditions except of course our creative literature, Apsaras.The NyAya-vaisheshika considers them to be wielding an airy etc body with a dash of earthly mix.As a fact they are yet to be encountered,subjected to hypothesis,thought seriously as a species of beings.  
  
In subjects like para-psychology and in experiments carried out by theosophists and in certain Tantric practices one can trace the presence and use of such 'beings'.  
  
In Greco-Roman tradition any conceptual difference between a fairy and a nymph ?
