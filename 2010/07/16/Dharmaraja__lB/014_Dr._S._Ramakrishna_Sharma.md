The Yama Samhita** which is an extract from the 9th Chapter of Ahilya Kamdhenu, a work of Hindu Law, says that Dharamaraja complained to Lord Brahma about his difficulties in performing his most responsible duties of keeping records of the deeds of men and doing justice to them. Lord Brahma went into meditation. Shree Chitragupta sprang from his body and stood before him **bearing an** **ink pot and a pen.** The God Brahma (Creator) said: "Because you are sprung from my body (kaya), therefore you shall be called **Kayastha **and as you existed in my body unseen I give you the name of **Chitragupta."****  
  
****Wikipedia provides many details regarding temples of Chitragupta, in Kanchipuram etc. But the one in Khajuraho is really imposing and elegant.**

The picture in the above page(file attached) does not depict the items mentioned to be held by him. However, ink pot and pen are the items associated with Chitragupta as held by the Kayastha community; also are worshiped by them during Chitragupta Puja.
