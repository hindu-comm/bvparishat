**Esteemed Scholars,  
  
The god presiding over death is variously called in our tradition.Yama and Shani are both sons of SUrya.During the Pitripaksha when we offer water to the manes,we also offer the same to 14 kinds of deities presiding over death or after-life world(called 'sAmparAya in Katha.Upa.).  
  
In the SAvitryupAkhyAnam of the MBh.Yama is found personified as a harbinger of death : "tatah satyavatah kAyAt pAshabaddham vashangatam/aNgushThamAtram purusham nishchakarsha balaad yamah //.This story has been treated as a spiritual symbol of the eternal journey of evolution by Sri Aurobindo in his legendary epic poem Savitri which stands out as the largest epic poem in English language.  
  
In the GaruDa PurANa etc there are vivid descriptions.  
  
In his autobiographical ChitshaktivilAsa,Swami Muktananda confirms through his realisation that the Yamaloka etc lokas are existing as a matter of fact.  
  
Mostly Yama is a side-deity in the temples and so is he depicted in the literature on iconography.  
Some cases of NDE(near-death experiences) also give retrospective outlines of what the corporeal aspect of Yama is like.  
  
There is a Yamasmriti,but this Yama is an AchArya.  
  
In the literature related to eschatology a lot of matter could be traced on Yama in Hindu and other religions.  
  
The two versions of the Tibbetan Book of Death are highly revealing.Death is not less interesting than life.  
The GItA says " Yamah samyamatAm aham".  
  
Yama is also equated with Time or Guardian deity of Time.  
  
In Odisha there is a certain observation or vrata as we call it,called "BATa OshA" which seems to be of a tantric origin to ward off premature death and ensure longevity through fasting,worship and swearing in the local language with the roots and branches of a plant named 'vajramUli' symbolising strength to fight death.  
  
In the Vedas the hymns of AyushkAma etc delineate the nature and force of this fearful deity.  
  
Best regards,  
  
SMMishra**
