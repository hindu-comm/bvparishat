अयि भो महाभागा: !  
  
\>The Rajasthan High Court is going establish a library on judicial systems.  
In the above context, certainly "justice" does not pertain to or connote posthumous  
execution of some sentence/punishment. Yama and Dharma or Yamadharmaraja  
and his weapons come into picture after the departure of the embodied soul from the body, that is death.  
The Library is going to be in Manushya-Loka and not in Pitr/Preta-Loka and hence using Symbols related to Yama would be incongruous, if not ridiculous.  
However, there is no dearth of resources in our Scriptural Lore for suitable symbols with apt quotations.  
Why not suggest रथारूढ-अर्जुन-पार्थसारथि: with the quotation "तत्रश्री:विजयो भूति: ध्रुवा नीति:"  
as the dynamic symbol of divine justice with righteous human vigil, for the Library?  
Do they not use the Bhagavadgita as the Sacred Scripture for swearing?To be secular, let there be the TulA too!
