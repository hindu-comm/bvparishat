Namonamah.

thanks to all the scholars who enlightened us on this matter.



The Rajasthan Highcourt is going etablish a library on judicial systems. Justice Chouhan asked us to find the description of symbol of justice in indian literature. The muslim and christian traditions have the symbol of weighing machine (TulA)for justice. is there anything such in our tradition?



I heard from my elders thatYama has two forms Yama and Dharma. Yama is fordecision of the fate sinners where as the Dharma sees the worthy people.any reference?it will be better if we find some fotos yama in his dharmasana. may it be available?
