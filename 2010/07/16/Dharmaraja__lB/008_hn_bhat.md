The Rajasthan Highcourt is going etablish a library on judicial systems. Justice Chouhan asked us to find the description of symbol of justice in indian literature. The muslim and christian traditions have the symbol of weighing machine (TulA)for justice. is there anything such in our tradition?  

  

Sorry the images of Tula/libra zodaic circle were not visible when the sent message was viewed. Hence here is another copy:

The second one:

Hope these will be visible. It is a zodaic sign and the great versatile scholars of our group may be able to justify the significance of the sign and confirm or reject whether it has anything in common to justice.
