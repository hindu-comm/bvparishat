The tulaa symbol comes from the Greek-Roman tradition as far as I can determine. See <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Justice> The symbol has no particular association with any living religion. If it is found in Islamic states, it has come from Christianity or recent Western influence.

The association of tulaa with moral force is found in the Indian tradition; cf. Mahaabhaarata: 1.69.22 and 13.74.29: a;sva-medha-sahasra.m ca satya.m ca tulayaa dh.rtam / a;sva-medha-sahasraad.dhi satyam eva vi;si.syate //

(MB 12.156.26 differs only in the fourth paada: satyam evaatiricyate. MB 13.23.14 differs in the third and fourth paadas: naabhijaanaami yady asya satyasyaardham avaapnuyaat /)

When there is a conflict between history (which is a necessary but imperfect science) and the 'aa no bhadraa.h kratavo yantu vi;svata.h' principle, the latter should prevail. This is the spirit of Miimaa.msaa, too, and Miimaa.msaa is a very important science for law interpretation.

Mahaabhaarata 13.74.30 reads: satyena suuryas tapati. satyenaagni.h pradiipyate / satyena maaruto vaati. sarva.m satye prati.s.thitam //

Just writing "sarva.m satye prati.s.thitam, Mahaabhaarata 13.74.30" under the tulaa image should suffice to indianize the symbol. The text a;sva-medha-sahasraad.dhi satyam eva vi;si.syate / satyam evaatiricyate would be too long and too particular. Because of its reference to a;sva-medha, the text may even seem outdated to most people.
