The symbol of Tula is the name of a zodaic circle Rashi, which is characterized by the balance, as we can see in the pictures.



  

Another site has the same:

Here is a photo of Yama (inded but the actor in his character) in in his seat:

Another photo of Yama on his carrier Mahisha:

  

This is a picture of Yama in the episode of Satyavan and Savitri:

With due respect to all those have cited many sources of reference highlighting different aspects and personage of Yama, I have to offer this to the above question.

  

It seems Dharmaraja and Yama are two aspects of the same personification of death. By punishing those who violate Dharma, he does both functions establish the Dharma and prevent people from violating it (samyama or Yama). I could not look for references for this assumption, but only it is suggested by the two epithets. I have heard that Garuda Purana offers description of different kinds of hells to which sinners are convicted.
