Dear Scholars,

  

Let me thank first the scholarsfor the scholastic and authentic information provided by them.

  

Just I thought of the conversation between Yama and Yami in the Xth sUkta of Xth Mandala of Rgveda in connection with his epithet as Dharmaraja. Does the conversation remind us of Adam and Eve the first man and woman in the creation according to X'ian theology? Any comparison, parallelism or relation between the concepts? According to
Bhagavata Purana, the Manu and his wife were the first progenitors of human race.

  

Thanks for both the scholars.
