In the Rgveda, the dress of Yama who is associated with the place of justice is particularly related to a turban with an extra long cloth called turaa. ( Eko yamasya sadane turaaSaaT).Even today this dress is known in Peshawar and the extra cloth is called Turraa. ( Idiomatically it is called Turaa chodanaa) It was an insignia of the royalty and might be the justice as well. That is why the word Dharmaraja. The horrible form in later literature is missing in the RV.Later it was transferedto Indra. ( TuraaSaaT). Its survival is in modern Jamashedas to some extent. Regards, spnarang
