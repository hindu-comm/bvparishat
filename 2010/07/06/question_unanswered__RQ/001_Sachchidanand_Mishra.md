Dear Friend,  
It is a little late but I am trying to answer your question. Actually you asked a very problematic question. If one tries to answer them properly he would have to write a full article. Briefly I take both your questions together because they are interrelated.  
A few scholars have thought about this problem and tried to answer. Prof. Sib Jivan Bhatacharya in his article "Meaning and Scepticism: Some Indian Themes and Theories" in Prasad H.S. (ed.) Philosophy, Grammar and Indology, Essays in Honour of Gustav Roth, Published from Indian Books Centre, Delhi 1922, p.1-20. raises this question and finds no satisfactory answer. This problem can be seen as "Impossibility of communication". If what is perceived cannot be communicated then how there would be communication? Prof. P. K. Mukhopadhyaya has tried to give a proper solution to this problem in his recently published article "A Transparency Theory of Language". published in the volume of JICPR XXVI Number 1. Please consult the journal. This is true that the Shabdabodha does not reflect the ontological structure of the reality which is grasped by perception. But it does not mean that it does not grasp the reality. When one perceives inherence of neela to ghata, after that one knows the identity of Neelarupavan to Ghata. I do not find this explanation in any text because the question is not raised in Shastras, but I am sure that the possible answer would be that through Jnanalkshana sannikarsha we know this identity of neelarupavan to ghata. In case we listen to the sentence "Neelo ghatah" the immediate cognition caused by this sentence does make inherence as its object. But after that through Jnanalakshana Sannikarsha we know that inherence. Therefore, in each of these cases when we know blue pot thorugh perception and also when we know that blue pot through words the same type of apperception arises "Neelam ghatam janami". In the case one utters the sentence one does not cognizes identity between blue colour and pot, rather between "blue colored and pot". This is not the case that whenever we perceive the terms of a relation, we perceive the relation. The Navya-Naiyayikas admit that we perceive inherence following the path of Bhasarvajna.
