Thanks Sir for your clarification.

  

Prakriya system started from Rupavatara of Dharmakirti is followed generally for the structure of a text in the system. In following to certain extent Bhattoji organized according to the topics dealt with under different Prakarana-s. At times, he sticks to the order of Panini's Ashtadhlyayi also in some cases. May be the reason as per your expert opinion is their immediate utility and those casually utilized. Why Sanja-prakarana is well answered by your message.

  

Whether all the sanja-s collected under the head Sanja-prakaraNa- are of immediate use or not is a different question. This question needs close examination of the Paibhasa-s and their utility in the immediately following PrakaraNa-s up to SamathaH pada-vidhi. Samasa-prakaraNa.

  

More comprehensive than his predecessors, SK has achieved something utilized for next centuries by the learners of Grammar and Sanskrit in general. Better we can get most of it, than dwelling on silly questions, in my opinion, unless these criticisms are considered by scholars who commented upon it or any specific purpose is served by such questions which would enhance the understanding of grammar in general and or any given text of work grammar.

  

I was expecting you Sir to answer the question.

  

With regards
