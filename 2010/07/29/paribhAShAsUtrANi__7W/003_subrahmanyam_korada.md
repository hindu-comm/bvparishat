namo vidvadbhyah



Mostly the Paribhasas that are there in first adhyaya are taken . Samarthah padavidhih etc are not taken following

Astadhyayi . Panini does not pronounce all Samjnasutras at a single point of place . Why ? Because there

are two Paribhasas -- yathoddesam samjnaparibhasam and karyakalam samjnaparibhasam which will take care of .



Same is the case with Samjnaprakarana also . There , 'aa' etc are prAsangika .



Then why Samjnaprakaranam ? It meas 'samjnAnAm eva idam prakaranam 'and not ' samjnAnAm idam eva prakaranam' .

These things are there in big commentaries .



In any case it wil be ' VyakhyAnato visesapratipattih ...' .
