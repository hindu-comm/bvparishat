Just had a look into the pdf file named pitru-karma forwarded by Vasudean Moosad.

  

Casually I noticed the following points:

  

1\. It is पितृ-कर्म andपित्रु-कर्मcould not be anyway Sanskrit

2\. I have heard पित्रृभ्यः स्वधा and देबताभ्यो नमः।

3\. And some more typographical errors here and there.

  

It is a good idea to celebrate Fathers' Day in this way amongst other celebrations of days popularized by the west. Anyhow, there is already a Day dedicated to forefathers, Mahalaya Day is the one giving oblations to all our forefathers born in one's family and gotra and the preceding fortnight itself is reserved for them observed in such a way thatany other auspicious mangala-karma-s are avoided as a token of mourning to those deceased forefathers.

  

*Mahalaya*: Thursday, 07-10-*2010*

  

and in some regions the whole fortnight is observed for performing shraddha:

But respect to living fathers is a point to be observed by any children and looking after them when they are in need of it, in their old age is a responsibility not only left to the care of orphan parents camps following the western culture civilization. This is my personal opinion. When we are paying homage to our forefathers, who are no more with us, why should we Indians avoid this responsibility among whom Shravana Kumara who spent his life in the service of his lamed parents and paved the way to the forthcoming episodes of Ramayana:

It is to be noted that today parents may not be willing by themselves to be taken care of by somebody else, but it is the voluntary duty of the children. One may not expect them to ask them to request for his help, today.

  

Opinions of our members is solicited on this point, though it is beyond the realm of the objective of Bharatiya Vidvat Parishat and its scholars of Sanskrit, to assess its value in the present day of days of celebrations Fathers Day, Mothers Day, Lovers Day .. .. .. .. and so on.
