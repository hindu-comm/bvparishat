Dear Friends,



Nowadays it is noticed everywhere some prominant DAYS are playing important role in public life of our nation. The very conceptof such "DAYS" has intruded inIndia from west andit can NOT be easiliy eliminated from the young minds. The more we confront/oppose/critiseze partcipation in such occassions openly,the more young minds get attracted to them. Ultimately we fail to communicate our ideas.



In comparison with "F-day" that falls in August, theI-day/ Gurupurnima / Rakhi-Bandhan-dayseem to be faded. We should thinkhow to make these INDIAN-DAYS attractive. We should introduce new cncepts. The Raakhiconcept is now extended to all so called FRIENDS and Rakhi-day for Brotherhood notion is neglected.It is time toact carefully. One should not oppose but educate.



Letus encourage F-day but try to use the opportunity to introduce ourBharatiya Mitrataa. How to do this - ideas / thoughts are invited.
