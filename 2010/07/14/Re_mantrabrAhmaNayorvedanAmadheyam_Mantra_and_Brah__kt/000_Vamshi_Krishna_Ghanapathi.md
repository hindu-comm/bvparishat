विद्वद्वरैः जगन्नाथैः वेदलक्षणसम्बन्धिनी चर्चा समुद्भाविता।  
अस्मिन्नंशे, सर्वेषां विदुषां सौकर्याय आङ्ग्ल भाषायां समाधातुमिच्छामि।  
  

-   Mantra and Brahmana form Veda. This is the basic premise. As quoted
    by Jagannath, I am not sure who is the Vaartikakaara, who compiled
    this. -   
-   It is True that Mantra and Brahmana form Veda. This is the basic
    premise, while interpreting the Swaroopa of Veda Grantha. (As quoted
    by Jagannath) I am not sure who is the Vaartikakaara, who compiled
    this. -   Let me not delve deep into the semantics as such, whether the term
    Naamadheya denotes Lakshana or not. But, some of his inferences do
    not seem to be based on Normal Parlances. -   · For example: Executive, Legislative and Judiciary
    constitute Government. But, we normally never call Judiciary
    Goverment, Legislative Government and Executive Government. (Hence,
    referring as Satapatha Veda,Gopatha Veda does not arise) -   · However, in Executive is referred as Government, in a
    stand alone reference. Similarly, Mantras/ Chandaamsi are referred
    as Veda, in some stand alone reference. Hence, this type of
    references cannot be inferred to conclude the Braahmana is not part
    of Veda. -   · Rig Veda, Yajur Veda, Sama Veda are the references, to
    emphasise the prevalence of many Mantras, in these patterns. -   · Nothing can be said about, the definitive Number of
    Brahmana Grantha Texts; as so many texts are not available, even
    their names are heard. (As on dates, Aitareya, Satapatha,
    Taittireeya, Taandya, Gopatha Brahmanas are studied by students. In
    Samaveda, scholars refer to 8 Brahmanas - as Taandya, Shadvimsa,
    Aarsheya, Devata Adhyaya (Agni), Chaandogya – Mantra, Saama
    Vidhaana, Samhita Upanishat and Vamsha Brahmana ) -   · Apourusheyatwam Na Tu Braahmanaanam is also a faulty
    notion, propounded by western perspective. Nowhere, traditional
    scholars subscribe to this view. -   · If a syllabus has 6 subjects: Mathematics, Science, Social
    Studies, English, Kannada and Sanskrit for a class; we cannot infer
    that, Mathematics formed first, followed by Science... English etc.
    It denotes primacy, importance and order; but nevertheless decimates
    the importance of the latter texts. Thus, Mantras forming the basis
    of the current Form, Order of Vedas are uttered first. -   · Prior to the division and organisation of Vedic Texts by
    Veda Vyasa; there were just five references: Mantras 1. Rik, 2.
    Yajur 3. Saama and 4. Atharvana (Angirasa) and explanatory texts as
    Brahmana. In Vedic Texts, we find these references. -   · In fact, Taittireeya Saakha has many references; where
    first usage of Mantras is quoted, followed by the incidence of
    Mantras.

  

Therefore, understanding the concept in correct perpestive would dispel the notions.
