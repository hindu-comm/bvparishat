Sir/Madam,  
I have written a work in Sanskrit namely Abhanakajagannatha of my  
own proverbs. The number of proverbs is one thousand, three hundred  
and twenty two (1322). All proverbs are classified and arranged  
alphabetically in every classified group. Meanings of difficult words  
(in footnotes) are given in Sanskrit. An informative Sanskrit  
introduction is in the beginning. Alphabetical lists of all the  
proverbs, subjects and the words (shown in the footnotes) are given at  
the end for quick reference.
