Thank you sir.



Actually the work wasfirst published from Prakhya, Madhyapradesh and second time, Parimal publicatons Delhi.Copyright is mine. Third time, it was published from Mantralaya .



Unfortunately, the work was lost one year ago because of theflood occurredin Mantralaya. Fortunately, the work is in computer. So I thought that I may freely distribute it to all the SaMskRita lovers.It is not for commercial purpose.Now I am forwarding the same to my friends.



Still it is available in book form from Parimal Publications. But please do not purchase that edition. Because in the current version, I have made so many corrections, improvements and additions.



To be frank with you,Iput the ideas flashed in my brain into writinginstantly and I did not bother to compare with the old similar adages.It is original work. Since it is not research work, I can not fill the similar adages available in old literature. Actally the similarity in the ideas that can be found in some Abhanakas is simply accidental.



Your sincerely,

S.Jagannatha.
