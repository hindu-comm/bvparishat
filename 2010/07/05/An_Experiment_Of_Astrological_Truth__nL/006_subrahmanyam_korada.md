namo vidvadbhyah



There is connection among Jyotisam, Vedanta and Ayurveda --



Kalidasa in UttarakAlAmrta says thus -- punyam vApyatha pAparUpamapi vA karmArjitam prAgbhave ....



Whatever Punya and Papa is attained during the last lives is simply shown in the form of planetary line -up

in the Horoscope and it is the job of an astrologer to find out as to which PrArabdhakarma is there during which

planet's period .



'Avasyamanubhoktavyam krtam karma subhAsubham ' . JnAnAgnih dahati 'samcitakarma' only . PrArabdha

cannot be escaped (see Vedanta) .



Then why Grahajapa, Tarpana and Homa , ie. SAnti ? It is 'SAnti ' only not 'nivArana' . The person in question

thru Japa etc. can just decrease the intensity of the bad effect , i.e.
it is for 'samanam' .  
  
In Karmapaddhati , Bhartrhari goes to the extent that BrahmA (yena kulAlavanniyamito brahmAndabhAndodare),

Visnu , Siva and SUrya are no exception in terms of Karma .



Vasistha was the Purohita and fixed MuhUrta etc but Sita was in Lanka , why ?



Rama was born in KarkAtaka-lagna (also Nehru and Indiragandhi) and for those who are born in this Lagna

one of the following is inevitable - separation with spouse , chronic disease to spouse, death to spouse .



Sankaracarya's case is different - although he was born in
KarkAtaka-lagna due to the streangth of

RAjyAdhipati (lord of 10th place) and other factors he was destined to attain Moksa .



If Karma is all why MuhUrta etc. ?



Yes , it is the tradition set by great sages that to avoid any further
difficulties and problems it is better to

follow auspicious time , i.e. MuhUrta etc. . Since the Planets will be in good places ( astamasuddhi etc.)

there will be check .



If the Astrologer is not competent, i. e. is not a Yogi , then we cannot expect the right results (just like in the case

of a Doctor) . SAstra does not fail but the one who knows it and does not lead an ascetic life .



There are different MAnas - CAndramAna, SauramAna etc. . To be frank we do not have the equipment and

material to go into such aspects - mahAjano yena gatah sa panthAh .



If there is the duo, Kuja and Budha in MesarAsi in the Horoscope then the person will become a NAstika / HetuvAdin .



As described in BhAgavata (sixth skandha)) they are filled with ' Vairabhakti ' . If anybody is enjoying wealth

etc being a Nastika it is due to the Punya of earlier lives .



One should not judge simply by looking his outer appearance . The wealthy foreigners thronging the Asramas is

just an example . If one does not believe in Karma-siddhAnta then he has to answer as to why he is like that !



According to the Planetary line up only a person enjoys good health . Otherwise the person would suffer from

VAta (Sani) , Pitta (Budha), Kapha (Guru) , i.e. related diseases .



It consumes more pages to go into that aspect and I shall offer more
on Ayurveda when there wil be a related question from scholars .
