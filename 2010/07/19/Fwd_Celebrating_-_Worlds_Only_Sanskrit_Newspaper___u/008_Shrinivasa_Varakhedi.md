Dear Shri Sati Shankar ji

  

thanks for your open offer to support and suggestions. The central Govt gives some grants which are very meagre. However, this year it is increased. Shri Sampat is running the paper with little support by local people and fee-less service by local scholars. I will certainly inform him to use online support for donations and support.

  

with best regards,

shrivarakhedi
