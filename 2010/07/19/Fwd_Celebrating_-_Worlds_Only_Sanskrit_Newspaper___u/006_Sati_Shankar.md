DearProf. Shrinivasa Varakhedi Ji

  

Thanks for putting it here, on this forum, it should not be taken by the readers of this post as a charity but as their moral responsibility.

For contribution money, Order/ or demand draft is suggested. As you know time has changed and these methods involve a lot of time and other costs.

  

My only suggestionis that if you are in contact with the publishers please suggest them to open/provide a bank account detail for the purpose and let people know. This will make contributions convenient to those willing to support.

  

It appears from the history they have given on their website that they still resort to "posts delivery of the daily newspaper", In this information age delayed news looses its value. Also, it is not cost-effective now.

Please advise then to combine the electronic delivery of their newspaperwherever applicable This will help them save when no Govt support is being received.

  

Above all, the endeavor should be supported and its significance should need no explanation to the learned community of the BVP.

Regards

Sati Shankar
