Dear Sir,  
  

I do not think every word in every language from every part of the world with different cultures should be traced back to Sanskrit Language and Indian culture. If I am wrong, please correct me. This is only my personal idea, but not an opinion or judgement.

I can't say anything of the nativity of this Pushkarasadi Acharya. His name is पौष्करसादि आचार्य which is derived as follows:

  

पुष्करे सीदतीति पुष्करसादः, तस्यापत्यं पुमान् पौष्करसादिः।

  

Or it may be पुष्करसादानां गोत्रापत्यं पौष्करसादिः by which we may suppose him or his family belonging to पुष्करतीर्थ which is situated in Ajmere (as I came to know from the web pages) in Rajasthan :
