**Grateful to the discussants on this pratyAhAra-related issue and the citation of the applied vArtika 'cayo dvitiyAh shari paushkarasAdeh'.  
  
'Paushkarasa is referred to as the scholar attesting this change : ta>tha;ka>kha and pa>pha.Thus 'apsarAh' becomes 'aphsarAh'.  
  
**This may help us to safely arrive at the previously much thought over genesis of the word 'fairy' from 'apsarAh'.**  
  
Someone will kindly enlighten me if this Paushkarasa hailed from the north-west part of erstwhile India !  
  
Best regards,  
  
S M Mishra**
