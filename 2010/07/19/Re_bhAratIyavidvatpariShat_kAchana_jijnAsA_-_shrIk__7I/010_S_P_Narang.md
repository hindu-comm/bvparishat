Pusakara was on the route of the highway from Ujjain to Peshawar and the traders used to go to this route to china taking the silken road later. Its modern name is Katasraja and it is said the maximum rose grows here. It is a religious place as per a Pakistan Website. Most probably Paippaladas migrated from Kashmir to this place and went to Multan. A few Multani words e.g. Hosi for aasiit are found in Paippalada. Pushkar and rose, once upon a time had been synonyms. That is why jalakamala and sthalakamala are found in literature. Phonetics of this area including the current phonetics of this area has the similarity to the expression of the Varttika: cayo dviitiiyasya....Pauskaraasaadeh. It requires further investigation particularly about the route from Kashmir to Orissa. We may find a few clues in Bloch: Indo-Aryan. Regards, spnarang
