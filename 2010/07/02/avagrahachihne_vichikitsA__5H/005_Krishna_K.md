Namaste,

The argument is not based on avagraha but on the split of  
savarNadIrgha only. The text is "sa AtmA tattvamasi shvetaketo", and  
the argument is that the split should be 'sa AtmA atattvamasi' based  
on the illustrations given by Uddalaka. In advaita-siddhi, madhusUdana  
agrees that the split can be eitherwise, but proceeds to prove that  
the illustrations support abheda, hence the split 'sa AtmA tattvamasi  
shvetaketo' is more appropriate.

I have seen a couple of older mss and they did not employ the avagrahachihna.

Regards,  
Krishna
