Dear friends: In a majority of cases, Avagraha was being made out from the context only. Even in the case of Savarnadirghasandhi ,the meaning
can be made out from the context. Sri Madhvacharya argues in his Srivishnutattvavinirnaya that the famous Chandogya text: **Tattvamasi** is actually **Atattvamasi** since itis preceded by the word **Svetaketo !** Thus Svetaketo + **A**tattvamasi = Svetaketo 'Tattvamasi, the letter **A** being elided by the rule **Engah padaantaad ati**. According to him, there is an Avagraha which, however,is not shown in mss.
