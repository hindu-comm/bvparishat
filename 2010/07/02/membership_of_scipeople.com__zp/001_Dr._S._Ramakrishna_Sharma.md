Respected Rajkumari Ji,  
  
The invitation was sent form my personal account in the group referred to.  
It is an international group of scientists where I wanted to present the concepts  
related to Vedic Sciences. As a part of inviting contacts the website exported the contacts  
from my g-mail a/c and many have received the invitation.  
  
This dialogue may not have relevance here. Rather, it would be embarrassing.  
However, if you join the group "Vedic Research Methodology" which I have created  
there my invitation would serve a purpose.  
  
\>Do I have to create another account for this purpose. Please guide me and oblige ...  
Yes, you have to.  
  
Thank you.
