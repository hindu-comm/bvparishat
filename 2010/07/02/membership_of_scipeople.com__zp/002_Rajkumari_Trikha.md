Respected Dr. Ramakrishnan,

I have registered with the [scipeople.com](http://scipeople.com), as per your advise and I have created another email account along with another password. This group has confirmed my registration also. I sent an email there, but to my despair its delivery failed. I sent it to [scipeople.com](http://scipeople.com). from my new email id and original password( not the new one which I gave to this group. The report says that the address is not complete.Please guide me what address should I give in the ' to ' column.Please give me your mobile no. also to clear doubt in this regard speedily.

With thanks and due regards,

Rajkumari Trikha
