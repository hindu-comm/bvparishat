Sadananda's Vedantasar is a very useful primer for the people who want  
to understand the basic concepts of Advaita Vedanta. The Great  
Mimansaka Apadeva wrote a commentary on it. It is known as Balbodhini  
and many times Apadevi. It had been published long ago in 1911from  
Vani Vilas Prakashana, Shrirangam. The commentary is very useful in  
the sense that it makes many complex points very clear. This  
commentary is written using Navya-Nyaya’s technical language and  
style. Therefore, makes the point so clear that everybody could  
understand the points without any further confusion. But there had  
been the limitation that only those people could understand who had  
adequate understanding of Sanskrit in general and of Navya-Nyaya  
concepts and techniques in particular. I have written a Hindi  
Commentary named “Balavyutpattivardhini” of Sadananda's Vedantasar  
taking the essence of Apadevi and other commentaries.  
The present edition of The Vedantasar includes original text, Apadevi  
and Balavyutpattivardhini.
