Thanks for the information with authentic quotation.

  

Still the date of the appearance of Pancaratra texts could not be underestimated. Probably give and take of concepts could be accepted at the same period of time. Available Pancaratra- texts of Samhita-s and Agama-s go back to early 10th century and not earlier according to a writer on the History of Vaishnavite Reliogion and he concludes that some clue to earlier texts could be found by the study of South Indian Vaishnavaite literature and probably the apearance of Saivaite works concurs with the appearance of Vaishnava Samhita-s in all probability.

I am not contradicting with the authentic assertion, but only the other side of the argument is just presented highlighting the possibility of exchange of concepts between the two faiths.
