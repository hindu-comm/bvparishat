Thanks for the information and querry. I am afraid am not in a position to provide the precise reference. It is quoted in Prasannaparijata of Varadaguru the source ascribed to Pancaratra texts according to some sources on the web.

  

I could not check the source. Somebody would be able to do so and locate the verse to confirm.  

  

With regards
