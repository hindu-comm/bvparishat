Dear Dr Bhat n Dr Rao,  
  
Thanks for the Q&A that we have known the 8 flowers offered to Lord Vishnu.  
  
May I know the origin of this idea in Vaishnavism ?  
  
One similar case I can trace in the eight kinds of seeds that Rajarshi Kuru sowed as prompted by Vishnu in Dharmakshetra-Kurukshetra according to the VAmana Puran etc..Those are tapas,satya,kshamA,dayA,shaucha. dAna,Yoga and brahmacharya.These are called AshTAnga MahAdharma.  
  
Best regards,  
  
S M Mishra
