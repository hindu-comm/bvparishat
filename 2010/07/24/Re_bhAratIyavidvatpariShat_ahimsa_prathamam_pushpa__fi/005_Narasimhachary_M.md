Dear friends: The Rahasyatraya Sara of Sri Vedanta Desika, the post-Ramanuja polymath, quotes the two following verses, describing the eight flowers which would delight Lord Vishnu:  
  
Ahimsaa prathamam pushpam pushpam indriyanigrahah  
Sarvabhootadayaa pushpam kshamaa pushpam viseshatah  
  
Jnaanam pushpam tapah pushpam dhyaanam pushpam tathaiva ca  
Satyam ashtavidham pushpam Vishnoh preetikaram bhavet  
  
It is to be noted that these verses are quoted by Sri Vatsya Varadacharya (also known as Nadadoor Ammal), a senior contemporary of Vedanta Desika in his Prapanna Paarijaata.  
  
Sincerely,  
  
Narasimhachary
