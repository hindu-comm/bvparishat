Respected Scholars,



This concept ofbhavapuspa-(flowers of sentiments)offeringwhich is connected with manasa-puja goes back to the early 6th century and associates with the Saiva religion. The earliest literal references of thisisfound in some of the earliest Saiva tantras such as the Nisvasatattvasangraha (abhāvaṃ dhyā …. abhāvaṃ labhate padam\|

 abhāvaṃ śivamālambya bhāvapuṣpasamanvitam\|\|

 bhāvapuṣpeṇa so.abhyarcya śivatāveśabhāvitaḥ\|

 śāntatvācchitvamudiṣṭo hyalak.sye abhāva ucyate\|\|)

& Svacchandabhairava tantra(3.105).  
Another early Saiva canon the Kalottara also speaks of it and many other later Paddhati literature have referred about itwith great importance.



Another important point about it is that: This Bhavapuspa (is commonly knownasastapuspa) and its association with the Astamurti form os Siva.( I quote bellow a part of my artcle on this subject)



The Aṣṭamūrti form of Śiva is a very early concept and the first and clear reference has been found in the Śatarudriya a portion of the Yajurveda. Śiva is described as the whole universe which means He is manifested as the Sun, Water, Fire, Air, Soul, Earth, Moon and Ether. This form is repeatedly discussed in both ways of explicitly and implicitly in many early Tantrik canons like Niśvāsa, Svacchanda, Raurava, Kalottara and in some of the early Puraṇas like Vāyu Purāna. Even this concept of Aṣṭamūrti form is very beautifully presented by the great classical Sanskrit poet Kālidāsa, and if we assign his period to the 1^(st) century A.D. then the antiquity of this concept and the Śaiva religion go back to the 1^(st) century. Interestingly there are some accounts on the relation of this aṣṭamūrti form of Śiva with the aṣṭapuṣpa have been enumerated in the Bāṇa’s works like Kādambarī and Harṣacaritam who belongs to the 5^(th) century. In his famous work Harṣacarita, Bāṇa has beautifully described the eight forms of Śiva in the reflection of the Upaniṣads and the later Tantrik texts.
