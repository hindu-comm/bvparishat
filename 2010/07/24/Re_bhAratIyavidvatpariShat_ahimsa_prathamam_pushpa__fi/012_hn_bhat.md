Dear Sir,

  

Thanks for the quotations from Madhwacharya and Mahabharata. I had produced a quotation from Varada Acharya's Prasannaparijata, a vishisthadvaitin acharya, contemporary of Sri Ramanuja, as mentioned by Narasimhacharya. The quotation is to be traced back Pancaratra texts, but source is still untraced precisely to any particular Samhita or Agama of Pancaratra.

  

It is a common ideal of way of living in the real world with dedication of these sentiments as I had earlier pointed in my earlier message without any bounds of Vaishnavism or Shaivism. I fully agree with you it is a high ideal philosophically feasible to all the faiths.

  

Thanks once again for your contribution to the ongoing discussion.

  

The question was limited to the earliest references to the concept of bhaava-pushpa in the available texts.

  

With regards

î—“
