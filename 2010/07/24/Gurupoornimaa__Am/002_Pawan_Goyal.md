Dear Friends  
  
Guru Purnima is directed towards Srila Vyasadeva, thus in some sampradayas they refer to Guru Purnima as Vyasa Purnima. Krishna Dvaipayana Vyasa was born on the full moon day (Purnima) of the month of Asadh (Hindu - Vedik Calendar). As Vyasadeva is considered the guru of Vedic culture, this day is traditionally the day when the guru is worshipped.

Pawan
