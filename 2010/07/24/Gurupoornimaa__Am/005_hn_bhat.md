Anyhow a news about the celebration of Deepavali. Here is a web page containing different faiths regarding the celebration of Deepavali or Deewali in different states:

  

> India is a land of festivals. Diwali, the Festival of Lights, is > celebrated with fervor and gaiety. The festival is celebrated by young > and old, rich and poor, throughout the country to dispel darkness and > light up their lives. The festival symbolizes unity in diversity as > every state celebrates it in its own special way.

  

Here is the link to the page:

  

  

  

In south, in Karnataka, we celebrate Narakacaturdashi

  

There is even an interesting legend behind this festival. The story goes that Narakasura, a demon, ruled the kingdom of Pradyoshapuram. Under his rule, the villagers suffered a lot of hardship as the demon tortured the people and kidnapped the women to be imprisoned in his palace. Seeing his wickedness, Lord Khrishna set out to destroy the demon and the day Narakasura died was celebrated as Deepavali, the triumph of good over evil.

  

and for celebration, we take oil bath all children and elders that day and celebrate it with new dresses bought. It is also known as childrens day (not the new one the Birth Day of Jawaharalal) of Deepavali.

  

The next day is celebrated as Pratipad Bali Paadya celebrating the return of Bali, who was kicked into Paatala, on earth once in a year to see the people on earth:

  

The first day in the bright fortnight of kaartika is known as*bali paadya and then follows Tulasi Pooja for ten days.*

  

according to Madhwa tradition and in Udupi all these days are specially celebrated with special Pooja's to Krishna. Here is the link to this special calendar:

This is what I heard of Deepawali. And, Lakshmi Pooja is also celebrated by business people, and Annual Accounts are got settled from their customers who are invited to their shop. This is another feature of the Festival.

  

Many more may be found from different regions.

  

Yamadvitiiya is also another one during the time. Bhagineehasthabhojanam is one more I found in another web page.

  

Hope we can get more informations from the members from different regions.

  

With regards
