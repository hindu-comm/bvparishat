Is there any relation of Ganeshotsava and the ancient traders who came to India  
and left later for the trade. agale barasa phira jaldi aa gives a clue to this.  
In ganesh Purana, Ganapati has a relation to GRtsamada. Perhaps, they came to  
BhRgukachha and went back. It is to be traced in the ancient Indian Economical  
Geography. Regards, spnarang
