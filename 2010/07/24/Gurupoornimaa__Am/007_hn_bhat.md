Sorry. I forgot to insert the link to the page:

  

<http://www.indiaexpress.com/faith/festivals/dhistory.html>

  

[](http://www.indiaexpress.com/faith/festivals/dhistory.html)containing history of Deepawali. There are many other web pages containing information about Deepawali, One of them is the Pattabhisheka ceremoney celebrated on that day.

  

In Tulunadu, Baliyendra or Bali occupied the postion of Indra, and this is celebrated all through.
