Dear Prof Dixit,  
  
I can tell about Deepawali.  
  
This ceremony was observed by the inhabitants of Ayodhya, the Kingdom of Lord Ramachandra, while Lord Ramachandra was out of His Kingdom due to His 14 years banishment by the order of His father. His younger step-brother Bharat, took charge of the Kingdom for this period. The day on which Lord Ramachandra took back the charge again from His brother, and seated on the throne, is observed as Diwali, and Deepavali. Deepavali means numerous candles. In India, this Deepavali function is celebrated as a special auspicious occasion.  
  
Regards  
Pawan
