Pranaam.

Neither Patanjali, nor its sequel treatises mention about Chakras. It  
seems that the tradition has emanated from Shaakta Tradition.

मूलाधारं तथा स्वाधिष्ठानञ्च मणिपूरकम्।  
अनाहतं विशुद्धाख्यं आज्ञा चक्रं विदु र्बुधाः।  
तवाधार स्वरूपाणि कोण चक्राणि पार्वति।  
त्रिकोण रूपिणी शक्ति र्बिन्दुरूप श्शिव स्स्मृतः।  
अविनाभाव सम्बन्ध स्तस्माद् बिन्दु त्रिकोणयोः।।

This is the daily prayer of many Yoga Traditions, including our own.  
We need to find the source for this. (As evident, this correlates -  
Shiva - Parvati relation, synergy).

Shatchakra Nirupanam is one of the texts, which provides first  
references about Shatchakras. Moreover, these Chakras are not  
physical, but imaginery or meta physical - Ayurvedic texts or others  
might not have referred to them.

More thoughts are welcome.
