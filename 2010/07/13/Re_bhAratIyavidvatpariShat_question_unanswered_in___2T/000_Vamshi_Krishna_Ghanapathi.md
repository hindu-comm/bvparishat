Prof. Sachchidananda Mishraji!  
  
I missed out a couple of points, as I could not understand the words of Inherence>\>  
  
As you mention that that traditional Nyaya Sasta Texts do not have a reference to this doubt raised by Tamoghna Sarkar, I would like to put this across to some of my compatriots (Traditional Scholars, who do not have access to internet).  
  
For my reference, can you put these questions and your answer in Sanskrit (Typical Nyaaya style either Jaagati or Gaadaadhari)??  
  
Regards  
Vamshi Krishna Ghanapathi, Mysore.  
  
  
With Warm Regards
