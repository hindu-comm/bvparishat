\> I don't think that there is any link between the gait of horses or

Thanks to the detailed and well-studied replies of Rani  
Sadashivamurthy to the equally elegant questions raised by Sri  
Jagannatha. I also agree with Dr. Murthy in assuming the significance  
of imagination in naming the meters comparing the rhymes produced by  
the syllables with the names. It may not be in many cases, be not  
clear today due to different names given by different writers on  
prosody for the same meter according their imagination.

In any case, the poet of Ashvadhati, Devi-ashvadhaatii or Dasasloki  
traditionally ascribed to Kalidasa, certainly had the imagination of  
comparison of the metrical structure and the name which he is fond of.  
It can be clearly seen in the 4th paada of the first verse itself:

घोटीखुरादधिकधाटीमुदारमुखवीटी रसेन  
तनुताम्\|\|

He compares with the rhyme of the meter with the gallop and considers  
it to be superior to it by the grace of Devi pleased by it (probably  
the rhyme used in the sthothra).
