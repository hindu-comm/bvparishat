My view regarding the post of Dr. Hari Narayana Bhat.



In the verse quoted, the poet has made attempt to put the word
AshvadhaaTi. This kind of practice (of putting the name of the metre) is age old practice. There are several instances of this. In Stotramuktaahaara printed in Gujarathi printing press, a Chandobodhaka Ganeshastotra of various metres is printed names of the metres are mentioned clearly. In the Apte's dictionary, almost all the examples of
the metres have their names clearly mentioned in the bodies of the verses. What we can assume by the verse quoted by Dr. Hari Narayana Bhat is the name AshvadhaaTii became already well-known in the time of poet, that's all.
