I thank very much Dr. Rani Sadasivamurty for his thoughtful article brimming over information. As expected, he has given so many Shastirc references.

After reading his article I thought that I have to enhance my knowledge furtherby the help of learned scholar by asking him more questions.(The child asks more and more questions to his father out of curiosity.)

My doubts are regarding-

1.Two or more names for single metre and its exact relationship with meaning as,

हरिणी=वृषभचरित.

अश्वगति=खगति=पद्ममुखी

भामिनी=शैलशिखा

चम्पकमालिका=सलिलनिधि

अश्वधाटी=मत्तेभ

निःश्रेणिका=श्यैनी

वियोगिनी=वैतालीय

(These synonyms I have taken from Apte's Dictionary.Metres' having names more than oneis very common thing.)

2.Amarukavi'susing ShaarduulavikriiDita frequently for Shringara.

3.Ratnaakara's using Vasantatilaka(which suggests Shringaara)extensively even in Viira in his Haravijaya.  
4.Using Mattamayurii (which suggests Shringaara)for preaching Advaita Vedanta in HarimeeDe stotra(attributed to Shankaracharya).  
5.The word ShaarduulavikreeDita(play of Tiger).

\[Play of tigers I have seen in Discovery channel and Animal planet.Tigers play lovinglyand mutual affection.There is no sign of aggressiveness.Particularly, the play of tiger-cubs are very attractive.\]

6.Using any metre for Mangala, introductory part and ending part inSahitya as well Shastricworks.

7.Shastragranthas' using various metres (Ayurveda is included).

8.Using Sragdharaa in500 verses of Tattvamuktaakalaapa and more than 550 verses of Adhikarana-Saaraavalii belong to Vishishtadvaita(Both are authored by Vedantadeshika).

9\. Using SharduulavikreeDita in more than 700 verses of Kaalaamrita that belongs to Jyautisha(Most probably, the author is Venkatayajvan.Some say it is authored by Kalidasa.).

10\. In spite of using Viyogini for KaruNA in Naishadhiiya charita, usingthe same for Raajaniiti in Kiraataarjuniiya.



As usuall, I am eagerly awaiting information-filled response from the learned scholar.
