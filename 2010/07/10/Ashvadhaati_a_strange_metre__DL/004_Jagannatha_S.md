I don't think that there is any link between the gait of horses or  
movement of the horse in chess and naming this metre after it. We  
shall not forget that it is also called Mattebha. I came to know by  
the posts of scholars that it has a third name , Madaalasaa.  
Some years ago I had heard a shastric sentence: संज्ञावाचकशब्दानाम्  
अर्थप्रत्यायकत्वं नास्ति। (I can't recall exactly who told this to  
me.Neither I know where it is stated.) This statement aptly applies  
to the names of the metres. Names of the metres like मालिनी,  
वसन्ततिलका,शार्दूलविक्रीडितं, पञ्चचामरा, मेघविस्फूर्जितं,मत्ताक्रीडा,  
मत्तमयूरी,कलहंसी have nothing to do with the exact meaning.People love  
some names and combination of some letters, that's all.
