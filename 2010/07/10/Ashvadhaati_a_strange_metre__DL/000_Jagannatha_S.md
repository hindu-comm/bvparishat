Respected sir/madam,  
I have written a small article in Sanskrit namely ‘‘Ashvadhaatyaam  
Mallah-Bellankonda Ramarayah’’. I have uploaded the article just now  
to the section ‘files’.  
In Sanskrit prosody, Ashvadhaati is strange metre where the rhyme is  
compulsory. Mattebha is another name for it. I have briefly introduced  
Ashvadhaati and the poet Bellankonda Ramaraya. This poet has written  
300 verses in Ashvadhaati and that is literary record!  
In my article, I tried to create definition of the metre Ashvadhaati  
in the same metre using the name Ashvadhati itself. Formerly,  
scholars have tried to define Ashvadhaati using the name Mattebha.  
I humbly request you to read it.  
File name: ASHVDHTI65
