This question has been discussed by V.S.Sukthankar in 1936 (Ref: Epic  
Studies, part V Notes on MB commentators, Annals of BORI XVII)  
According to VSS 22 commentators who wrote fully or partly on MBH are  
known to Sanskrit literature. His list is too long to reproduce here.  
He considers five of the commentaries to be very important (not all of  
them are published)in chronological order: 1) Devabodha:Jnana-dipika  
2)Vimalabodha:Vishamasloka-tika 3) Sarvajna-narayana:Bharatharatha-  
prakasha  
4)Arjunamishra:MB-arthadipika 5)Nilakantha chaturdhara: Bharata-bhava-  
dipa. Nilakantha's commentary is well known. My difficulty with him is  
his wrong interpretation of astronomical statements in MBh as 100%  
astrological. This has created havoc among those who have absorbed MBh  
through the English translation of KM Ganguli.
