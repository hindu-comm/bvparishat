In addition to these mentioned, Krishnamachari mentions the commentaries by सर्वज्ञनारायण, यज्ञनारायण, वैशम्पायन, श्रीनन्दन and विमलबोध. A copy of MahabharataVyakhya by Kavindra(1600 AD)along with two anonymous commentaries निगूढार्थबोधिनी and भारतटिप्पणी are said to be available in Govt. Oriental Ms. Library, Madras. These seem to be unpublished and available in manuscripts as publication details are not given by him. (History of Classical Literature p.42-43). More details of commentaries and commentators are to be found in the pages.
