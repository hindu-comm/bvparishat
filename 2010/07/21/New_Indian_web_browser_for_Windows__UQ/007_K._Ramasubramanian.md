Dear Ghanapati,

Day before evening when Kuppa garu was talking to me, I told him that I  
am going for the WAVES conference to he held in Trinidad between 4-7 of  
August, 2010. He then immediately said that I should perhaps get in  
touch with you to get reference to some people in Trinidad who would  
like to meet me. Taking his suggestion, I thought I should write to you.

Also I am routing my trip to Trinidad via Houston (from Boston). On  
August 2nd evening and 3rd morning I will be in Houston. Would the  
person who was attending my lecture at Mysore, and also came forward to  
print the monograph, be free around that time, I would be happy to meet  
him. Once the link is established, I can give more details.

Thanks & Regards,  
-Ram.
