Dear Scholar Friends,  
praNamyA. I want to know if there is any relationship between the words of  
"Legion and Religion" as implied.  
What are the roots of these like in sanskrit? If there are roots what is the  
meaning of them? If we split the word  
"Religion" as "Re-Legion" does it connote the meaning of "Invasion by Invasion"  
with an army for a particular

purpose? Would you mind enlightening me in this regard.  
Regards,
