Dear Dr. Prasad,  
  
The National Group Song Competition in Sanskrit is limited to students of classes 6 to 12. There are a number active Shakhas of Bharat Vikas Parishad in Bangalore who are conducting this competition every year. This year's competitions must have already been scheduled to be held in July or August.  
  
In 2004 AD I had been to your esteemed university, along with a few members of the Parishad from Bangalore, for the conference of Vijnyan Bharathi (organised by Prof. K.I.Basu). The matter of NGSC in Sanskrit was discussed and we were told that your esteemed university had no school level students.  
  
However we look forward to your kind blessings, help and guidance to make the programme more popular. I request you to please visit the web site for more details about the programme.
