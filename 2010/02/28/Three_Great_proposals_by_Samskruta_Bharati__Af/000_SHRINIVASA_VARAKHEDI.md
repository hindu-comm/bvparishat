Dear All,

Samskruta Bharati's effort in popularizing Samskrutam among common  
public and making Samskrutam as a spoken language has a tremendous  
impact on Samskruta education. The continuous growth seen in the  
number of intake in Samskruta Universities in last two decades has  
proved that there is great awareness among public through these  
popular programs.

Now in the second phase, Samskruta Bharati wants to take up three  
major projects which aim at establishing Samskrutam in it's original  
form. Three proposals are made by Sri Cha.Mu.Krishna Shastry -  
Samskruta Bharati in Sambhashana Sandesha (This month).

1\. Bhaashaa-vyutpatti-yojanaa

This is to train young and potential students in correct, standard and  
good usage of Samskrutam. This is one year residential training after  
post graduation. No doubt after this thorough grinding trainee will be  
a good Samskruta Vidvan in language aspect.

2\. Shastra-prashikshana-yojanaa

This is the second phase of protection of Samskrutam. Under this the  
students will be supported and ecouraged to study any one Shastra with  
a Guru in a systematic manner.

3\. Ud-grantha-adhyayana-yojanaa

This is to support the high level studies in Shastras. Many student  
who are interested in studying higher works of different Shastras may  
find it difficult to continue due to lack of support. The support by  
UGC and Govt is very formal and not accessible to traditional  
students. This project facilitate the students to conduct their higher  
education with out any problem.

Bharatiya Vidvat Parishat and it's members would support these  
yojanaas by all means. There has been a criticism against Samskruta  
Bhaarati that popularization of Sarala (Easy) Samskrutam will harm the  
essence of Samskrutam and Shastras. BUT, THE EFFORTS BY SAMSKRUTA  
BHAARATI HAVE ALWAYS BEEN AIMED AT PROTECTING THE GLORIOUS PAST OF  
THE SAMSKRUTAM INTACT. WE SHOULD SUPPORT IT AND PARTICIPATE IN THIS  
YAJNA.
