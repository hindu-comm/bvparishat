Dr Pandurangi has asked a genuine question.In fact the foreign rule that Bhaarata experienced for about 200 years after about 600 years of Moghul rule is writ so large and deep in the psyche of at least some Indians who would prefer not to be called Bhaaratiiyas !  
Take our Nirad C Chaudhury the great author who called himself the last post of the British empire or a large chunk of our civil services who are a sad reminder of the officiousness and officialese of the lost but not forgotten regime.Our legislator,judiciary and press are not yet fully awake from the 'pre-midnight' syndrome.Our misunderstood concepts of 'secularism','minorityism','caste and reservation' and lots more speak of what we have knowingly kept alive from the political agenda of our erstwhile masters.The hangover is very expensive  
and we continue to pay heavily for the partition.Our brethren happen to be our worst enemies everywhere along the non-coastal borders.  
The title of Mahaamahopaadhyaaya was conferred on a number of pioneering scholars of Samskrit and Shaastras,particularly those who kept away from the freedom movement and poured all their energy into preserving and furthering the Shaastric traditions.But most of them were not pets of the regime,but yes they did not speak out or agitate leaving it to the more valorous and united.B G Tilak was 'Lokamaanya',but certainly not by a conferment by the British and many others like him.About MM. Balakrishna Mishra and his likes this is a fact.But not that they kowtowed,it was a normal practice to eulogise the rulers which they did.And of course a eulogy is hyperbolic.  
I came across a [ms.in](http://ms.in) our collection in which a scribe of Lahore in pre-partition India is praising and blessing Jallaluddin Akbar,the  
erstwhile emperor at the colophon.  
When Macaulay brought Samskrit studies to a standstill then certain pandits of Kolkata Sanskrit College wrote letters in poignant Samskrit verses depicting the pitiable condition of the college and the scholars to H H Wilson who was a benefactor of Sanskrit and had left for England which is all history now.I amy quote one such verse :  
 " golashrii-diirghikaayaa bahu-vitapi-tate kolikaataa-nagaryaam ,  
 nihsango vartate samskrita-pathana-grihaakhyah kurangah krishaangah /  
 hantum tam bhiita-cittam vidhrita-khara-sharo mekale-vyaadharaajah ,  
 saashru vruute sa bho bho uilasana mahaabhaaga maam raksha raksha // "etc.  
Wilson replied in Samskrit verses exemplifying high reverence for Samskrit : one is oftquoted :  
 "yaavad gangaa ca godaa ca yaavad vindhya-himaacalau /  
 yaavad bhaarata-varsham syaat taavad eva hi samskritam //"  
and at the end of another verse :" duurvaa na mriyate krishaa'pi nitaraam dhaator dayaa durbale !"  
Now also the spirit of Macaulay is still living and sabotaging the glory and progress of Samskrit at various levels in Svatantra Bhaaratam !
