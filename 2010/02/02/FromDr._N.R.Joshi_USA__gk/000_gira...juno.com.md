Respected Scholars, Namaste!

I did not advertise the book of Dr. Frit Staal. I was expressing my opinion of the book afterr reading it. I thoughtthe bookmay be useful to other scholars of this list. It contains a lot of information related to topics discussed on this list before.I received personal e-mails thanking me for bringing attention to this book.Dr Staal says that discovering the Vedas is like unpeeling an onion but without the certainty of reaching an end. Indeed it is true.

I saw the picture on the front page of the book somewhere else before. But I do not remember now, So I do not know its significance. Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
