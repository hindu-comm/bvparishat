Respected Scholars, Namaskar!

Thanks to Dr. Shrivara for showing interest in new perspective of Sanskrit proposed by me. He is interested to see the application of the phonemic symbolism extended to the words Krşţa, naşţa,Bhraşţa, and Sişţa.

These are grammatical forms (past participles and adjectives) derived from Sanskrit roots. So far I avoided giving examples of Sanskrit grammatical endings of verbs and nouns. I used only lexemes as examples for my phonemic symbolism.  
On this list it was stated that meaning convention in Sanskrit is very old.  
(1) My question is --how old are Sanskrit endings in grammatical forms? Before Panini there were at least 10 Sanskrit grammarians.  
(2) I was told that sounds are subject to change from Sanskrit words. My question-Who change relatively fast-sounds from the body of lexemes or sounds of grammatical endings? The development of languages like Marathi, Hindi shows the grammatical endings undergo changes faster than the lexemes. In that case what is the guaranty that grammatical forms listed by Dr. Shrivara did not undergo changes in the past?  
(3) Moreover Dr. S. Korad in his Feb. 9 listing wrote, “Prayoga śaraņam Vyākaraņam.” So should I say with grammatical forms we stand on slippery ground.

Even then I will try to explain the meaning of /ţ/ in the grammatical forms listed by Dr. Shrivara. But before that I have another question to respected scholars of this list.  
(4) The grammatical form (nominative, dual) of the word “Rāma” is Rāmau. It means “two Rāma”. The vowel /au/ is present also in the lexemes  
Naukā, Jalaugha, Yauvana, Laukika, Saubhāgya, ādau, aulāna and Saumitra. There is no sense of “two-ness” or “duality” in these lexemes. Now the question-Is /au/ in the grammatical form arbitrary? or does it have logical reason behind its choice?  
Thanks. N. R. Joshi.
