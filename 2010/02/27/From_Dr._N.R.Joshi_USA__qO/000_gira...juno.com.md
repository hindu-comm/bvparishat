Respected Scholars, Namaskar!

In the following discussion I am using the word “word” because it is easy to write. In my earlier postings I presented differences among lexemes, pada, Vaakya etc.

First I would like to thank Dr. Surendramohan Mishra for his posting on Feb.25. I appreciate his encouraging words about my speculations on meanings of letter-sounds. I did not use the phrase “meaning at an atomic level” because in modern physics the word “atom” carries a lot of information. So if we understand atomic means ‘reduced to the smallest unit (VarNa) of Vaak” then it is OK. The Jain linguists believed that words are material substances made up of atoms which are distinct from other material atoms in nature. The atoms of words are designated as sound-atoms in order to distinguish them from the material atoms. Naiyayikas opposed Jain theory.  
As a matter of fact Sanskrit words and their meanings is one of the main topics discussed in Philosophy of Language in India for past 2000 years. All schools and Acharyas (Upavarsha, Shankar, Kumaril Bhatta etc) Jain, Bauddha, Vaidika participated in this debate.  
Dr. S. Korad always respond carefully giving all pertinent details, I have great respect for him. I get puzzled when he wrote (Feb. 13 posting) “it is impossible to offer or register the meanings of all dhaatus, praatipadikas, pratyayas and nipatas”. This may be true in certain cases. However if we accept the thesis that meaning convention is very old in Sanskrit, changes of meanings have occurred, changes of sound have occurred, then my question is  
“What was the purpose of debate among grammarians, Naiyayikas, and many other schools on “Words and Meanings?” And what is the purpose of scholars like S.D. Joshi, Bimal Matilal, Gaurinath Shastry, K. Kunjunni Raja, Padmarajia (Jain theories). R.C. Pandeya, and of many other scholars in writing books on “Words and Meanings” in Indian philosophy of language? These books offer good review of the debate for the past 2000 years. Is that all? Are we just happy to know that we debated the topic? Thanks. N. R. Joshi
