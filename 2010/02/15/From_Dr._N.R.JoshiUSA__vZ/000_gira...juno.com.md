Respected Scholars, Namaskar!

First I would like to let scholars of this list know that BORI from Pune published my paper with the title, “Sphota Doctrine in Sanskrit Semantics Demystified” in their annual publication of either 2008 or 2009. I was told by my friend in India.

I am thankful to Dr. Shrinivas Varadkhedi for reading my posting. I am glad that he found it interesting. Trying to look for meanings on the VarNa level appears to be vague, Yes, I agree if one is looking for without foundation. However I got the foundation on which the whole VarNa level semantics is based. This idea did not come out of blue. I was interested in making sonographs of Sanskrit words. One gets many books on sonographas of English sounds. But very rare or none on sonographs of Sanskrit sounds. I was studying frequency spectrum of various letter-sounds of Sanskrit. I was reading books on Word and Meaning of scholars like Matilal, Gaurinath Sastry etc. Then my attention went to Sphota doctrine.

So last year we had discussion on this list about all aspects of Sanskrit such as different types of meanings, four levels of speech (Vaak), etymology, Yask and his Nirukta and problems he faced. I was reading books to find out the specialty of Sanskrit relative to other languages. I raised the questions about this on this list last year under “Why to study Sanskrit?” Then I attacked Sanskrit saying it is just like any other language of IE family. All languages have grammar, so did Sanskrit. Is there something different? Language is first, grammar comes later on.

I discussed what Dr. Varadkhedi was saying for meaning in sentence In that connection we talked about Abhihita Anvaya Vaada and Anvita Abhidhana vaada. We discussed what different Acharyas talked about meanings of Sanskrit word (Vyakti, Jaati, etc). I discussed that monosyllabic roots have meanings. Monosyllabic particles have meanings. Then idea came to try to extend it to the VarNa level, For that I needed some foundation. ( I did not believe trial and error method). This foundation I discovered in acoustic properties of articulated sounds. For Sanskrit these sounds are arranged in a periodic table of VarNa maalaa which is praised for its uniqueness all over the world. In my scheme 37 consonants and 16 vowels are axioms and each Sanskrit word is a theorem to prove. I do understand there could be exceptions because our understanding of meaning of Sanskrit words may be slightly different today from that in the ancient past. There may be changes in the sounds of words. All this is discussed in my book. For the advantage of the readers, tomorrow I will submit the content of my book once again. The content will give you an idea about the process of thinking I went through. Thanks. N.R. Joshi.
