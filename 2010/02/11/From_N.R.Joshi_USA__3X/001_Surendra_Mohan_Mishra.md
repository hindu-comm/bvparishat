Esteemed Scholars,  
  
Apropos of the discussion on the prefix 'abhi' the meaning ascribed by Shri N R Joshi as 'as if'' does not seem to hold good.*Abhidadhaati* would just mean rendering a cognition in words or language,subjecting an idea to expression in idiom,*abhilaapa-samsarga* in the Nyaaya parlance.As per S M Katre in his Dictionary of Panini ,'abhi' denotes the sense of towards,into,over and upon.M M Williams gives a number of possible meanings but not 'as if ' anywhere.If ' approaching' is one meaning to it,then 'as if 'could come close in sense,but then an actual use one has to come across to give credence to the idea.As Aklujkar rightly says all usages are not extant neither were they documented to be amenable to our scrutiny.  
  
Also i may add that the vyavahita usage of 'abhi' in the Vedas such as in ' abhi no nivartataam' etc be pondered over.  
  
With regards,
