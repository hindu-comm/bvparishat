Respected scholars, Namaste!

Fix meaning of prefix 'Abhi'.

I am glad to know that my raising question is appreciated. I am thankful to Prof. S. Korad and Prof. Aklujkar for valuable explanation of the Sanskrit prefix ‘Abhi’. I will try to get the paper of Prof Aklujkar.

On Jan 19, 2010 I wrote on this list about the topic of “speculations on Letter sounds of Sanskrit” I listed favorable and unfavorable points for such speculation. I am now proposing something which will be challenged by other scholars and I am fully aware of that. However as I said earlier there is nothing wrong in discussing controversial topics. According to my investigation, the prefix “Abhi” has fixed meaning. This fix meaning is “as if “. Before I give examples I respect grammatical details offered by Prof. S.Korad. Here are examples.

\(1\) The root ‘dhaa’ means to hold. Now ‘Abhidhaa’ means ‘as if holding’. In  
‘Abhidhaa’ the primary meaning is held but it is not physical holding. In other Vrittis meaning is changed.

\(2\) The word ‘Ruchi’ is physical taste such as salty or sweet. However a person can have taste of (or like) high quality literature. That test is called ‘Abhiruchi’ (as if taste).

\(3\) The word ‘Nava’ means new. When an old item is painted again or polished, then it becomes ‘as if new’ which is expressed by ‘Abhinava’.

\(4\) The word ‘Udaya’ means physical rise like ‘sun rises’. If a person gets prosperity in his life, then it is his ‘Abhyudaya’ (as if Udaya).

\(5\) The word, ‘Vyakti’ means an individual, a person, real form or nature. The word ‘Abhivyakti’ indicates display, exhibition, or expression.

\(6\) The word ‘Abhichaara’ means hypocracy. It is ‘as if chaara’ but not real.

\(7\) I would like to send greetings (‘Chintana’ ) to my friend. I do not know what he likes or wishes. So I say in my greeting ‘Abhiis’ta Chintana’ (as if you wished). In my opinion this is beautiful use Sanskrit prefix ‘Abhi’.

\(8\) The word ‘Jaata’ means born. Literature is born also but it is not physical birth like birth of a baby. It is ‘Abhijaata’ as if born.

\(9\) The word ‘Sneha’ is oil which attaches to certain surfaces. However ‘Abhisneha’ means affection. It is not physical attachment like oil but it is ‘as if attached like oil’’

\(10\) Finally what could be better example other than ‘Abhijnyaana Shaakuntalam’  
This example clearly shows difference between ‘to know’ and ‘to recognize’.

\(11\) The word ‘Dashana’ means seeing the object. However ‘Abhidarshana’ means seeing an image or photo of the object.

\(12\) The word ‘maana’ means measurement. In the word ‘Abhimaana’ one is measuring himself (or estimating once abilities) but it is not physical measurement.

\(13\) The root ‘Nee’ means to carry. An actor is acting on stage. He leads or carries emotions of his spectators. But he is not physically leading or carrying anybody. Hence it is called ‘Abhinaya’ (as if carrying).

\(14\) The word 'Roopam' means form, figure,appearance. Sometimes children play a mock courthouse. It is  
'Abhiroopa Nyaayaalaya'.It is not a real courthouse, it is 'as if courthouse''.

One can collect many examples like this. Context also plays its role. Slow thinking on meanings of words is required. Such fixing of meaning of a prefix offers ability to coin new terminology consistent with existing terminology. I fix this meaning of the prefix from the fixed meanings of letter sounds in the prefix ‘Abhi’.

My scheme of fixing meanings of letter sounds is based on the periodic acoustic properties of Sanskrit varNas listed in the table of seven rows and five columns of the consonants (35+1) and sixteen vowels. It is not random. It is tied from the bottom row (s, s’ h ---) to the top row (k, kh, g, --) and from left column of unaspirated sounds to the last column of nasals. Last two rows of sibilants and semi-vowels were rearranged.

I will give examples tomorrow. If you would like to raise question, please do so after my presentation of fix meanings of few consonants. This scheme shows that there is resonance between ancient Indian culture and Sanskrit words.
