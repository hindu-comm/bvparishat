Respected Scholars, Namaste!

I gave few examples of the prefix 'Abhi'. I mentioned this is not a quick process. One has to see the differences between pairs such as 'khyaa' and 'Abhikhyaa', 'Laapa' and 'Abhilaapa'. Then we look at the context where they are used. Different authors use them differently. I agree with the general statement not all ancient literature in Sanskrit has come to us. In my opinon, there is problem with the origin of Sanskrit. So there is nothing wrong in trying. If we say Sanskrit is like any other conventional language, then there is nothing further to explore other than grammar. That why I purposefully wrote sometimes back that there is nothing special in Sanskrit other than being one language out of big family. Now I am saying something different.

The Extreme Nirvacan Analysis

I mentioned that I will give examples of what I call phonemic symbolism. It could be called VarNavaada. But the word VarNavaada is used differently by different authors. The name does not matter. First I will give fix meaning of the phoneme /c/. This is the first unaspirated sound from the second row of palatals.

\(1\) Cakra-wheel. There is a focus at the hub where spokes of wheel converge.  
(2) Citra-image or picture. Camera focuses image on the film.  
(3)Caxu-eye. The eye focuses image of an object on the retina. I used ‘x’ in Caxu for ease of writing.  
(4)Aacamanam- sipping the water from the cup (focus) of the right hand during Sandhyaa vanadam.  
(5) Cumbana-kiss. Here lips are focused.  
(6) Caritra-biography. In Raama caritra the focus is on Raama.  
(7) Chintana-meditation. In cintana one focuses attention on a chosen deity. In cintana a scientist focuses his attention on the problem he wants to solve.  
(8)Caraņa-Toes of feet. In India it is said energy of the God is focused in his feet. So people touch the feet of the deity in the temple.  
(9) Catura-clever. A person clever and focused in conversation is called Catura.  
(10) Candra-moon. Sun’s light is reflected from the mirror of the moon to the earth. Here small moon acts like focus.

The phoneme /c/ does not have to be in the beginning of the word. Examples.  
(11) Sūcikā--a needle. It has sharp tip which is focus.  
(12)Ruci-a taste. Multiple taste buds are tiny focuses.  
(13) Kuca-a female breast. Here is no need for explanation. It is self evident.  
(14) Guccha-a bunch of flowers-spread on the top and focused at the bottom.  
(15) Car-It is a root. It means to walk. While walking there is focus where two legs meet to the trunk. These examples are more than enough. One can now check himself in other Sanskrit words with /c/ the meaning to focus.  
Let me give one more example. The semi-vowel /L/. It means ‘to stay within normal amplitude’ or ‘to stay within limits’.  
(1) Laj-The root means to blush. The act of blushing does not involve excess smile. It is little smile and then pulls back,  
(2)Laghu-small, short, little. It does not extend.  
(3)Laya-gradual merging. Here the amplitude of wandering mind is gradually reduced to stay within limits.  
(4)Laxya-target. The arrow shooter brings his attention to the target-and keeps it there.  
Again the semivowel /L/ does not have to be in the beginning of the word.  
(5) Tāl-It means rhythm. It remains within its limits.  
(6) Dolanam- a swing. It stays within its amplitude.  
(7) Mālā - a garland in which flowers stay on the string. They stay within limits.  
(8) Laxmaņa Rekhā This a nice cultural example where there is resonance between Sanskrit name and Indian culture. Laxmana asked Seeta to stay inside the line. Do not cross it. The line was known as Laxmana rekha.  
Now one can check himself this meaning in other Sanskrit words containing the phoneme /L/.

Here we are exploring only one phoneme from a word. Imagine the situation you having the chart of all phonemes with fix meanings listed. How nice it would to see the meaning of the word emerging phoneme by phoneme. This will bring out internal beauty of highly technical terminology used in grammar (such as Pratyaahaara), Darshanas (such as Prajnyapti and Vijnyapti), It will help to fix meanings of prefixes opening door for constructing new terminology consistent with existing terminology. I call this sort of analysis (phoneme by phoneme) of meaning of a word-The Extreme Nirvacana Analysis. I hope you will enjoy it. Thanks. N. R. Joshi.
