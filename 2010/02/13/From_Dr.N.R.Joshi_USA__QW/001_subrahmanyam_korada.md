Namo vidvadbhyah



Due to lack of time , feel sorry, I could not offer the explanation at a satisfactory level . Even to discuss 'abhi' there is a lot of

information in Vyakaranaitself --





as far as the roll of Upasargas is concerned Hari (Vakyapadiyam 2-188) offerers the following clarification -



sa vaacako visesaanaam sambhavaddyotako'pi vaa I saktyaadhaanaaya dhaatorvaa sahakaarii prayujyate II  


--the upasarga itself may express the special meaning, or since it is possible that the dhaatu itself expresses the meaning the upasarga

may be dyotaka or at times it may be useful as a 'helper' in generating the capacity to a dhatu.



There are some 'nirarthaka' upasargas (i.e. if used the total meaning that is expressed is not different from that of the bare verb followed by context etc. ) . Adhyaagacchati (oncomimg), paryaagacchati (coming from all sides)--



aprayoge'dhiparyosca yaavaddrstam kriyaantaram I tasyaabhidhaayako dhaatuh saha taabhyaamanarthakah II(ibid 2-190)



Hari picks up a Vedic sentence and exhibits how 'abhi' denotes meaning independently (2-201) --



sunvatiityaabhimukhye'bhih kevalo'pi prayujyate II



In the usage ' abhisunvanti' the bare 'abhi' is used in the sense of 'aabhimukhya'.



'Abhiraabhimukhye' is Niruktam(1st Adhyaaya).



The following is what is meant by Hari -- Aabhimukhyam deserves linga and samkhyaa and as such it is sattva. 'Asattvabhuto bhaavasca

tinpadairabhidhiiyate' - is the norm. Therefore the dhaatu cannot express 'aabhimukhyam'.Then 'aabhikhyam' becomes kriyaavisesana

in savana and gets construed with 'bheda'. As such it is ruled out that 'abhi' is dyotaka.



Karmapravacaniiya and Nipaata fall under this heading.



Panini himself registers a number of Sabdas with 'abhi' -- anabhihite 2-3-1, abhijanasca 4-3-90, abhijnaavacane lrt 3-2-112, abhiniskkraamati dvaaram 4-3-86, abhirabhaage 1-4-91, abhividhau bhaava inun 3-3-44 , abhinisah stanah sabdasamjnaayaam 8-3-86 etc.



Patanjali employed words with 'abhi'-- samskratya samskrtya padaanyutsrjyante tesaam yathaayatham abhisambandho bhavati tadyathaa

aahara paatram paatramaahareti ( abhisambandhah paurvaaparyalaksanah - Udyota) - Vrddhiraadaic 1-1-1, daatuupasargayosca abhisambandhah krtah , abhisaavakamicchati abhisaavakiiyati -- upasargaatsunoti... 8-3-65 etc.



The siddhaanta is that it is impossible to offer or register the meanjings of all dhaatus, pratipadikas, pratyayas and nipaatas .



It won't be , I rather think, amiss to discuss and search for variation of meaning taking Varnas . Panini who assigned different meanings

to'a' (anpratyaya in Taddhita and krdanta) and Sups, Tins etc. is margadarsii. Rather there will be more gaunaarthas rather than

vaacyaarthas.



In most of the items that are being discussed in this context it is the
' shade of meaning' rather than 'meaning' itself.



I close with the following quotations from Mahaabhaasya, Kaiyata and Nagesa --



saamrthah padavidhih (2-1-1) , Bhasyam--asambhavah khalvapyarthaadesanasya. ko hi naama samarthaho dhaatupraatipadikapratyayanipaataanaam arthaanaadestum?



Pradiipah - gauravaanavasthaasambhavaah parasparaantarbhaave'pi prthagupanyastaah,... praatipadikaanaamapi yatheccham

viniyogadarsanaat, saktiniyame tu purusasya vyaapaarah.



Uddyotah - yathestamiti- gangaadisabdaanaam tiiraadaavapi prayogaaditi bhaavah, nanvevam kosaasamgatirata aaha saktiniyametviti

saktibodhanetvityarthah.



Please see the three commentaries on ' agneh stutstomasomaah' 8-3-82 also
