Esteemed Scholars,  
  
Namaskaarah !  
  
I appreciate some of the basic questions put up by N R Joshi.Now his question regarding letters in a statement as meaning-bearers.Hari in VP has apparently denied this.But this needs to be further discussed.Ihave attempted to adduce some logic in my blogs in Sanskrit and English which may kindly be visited : [surendrashastram.blogspot.com](http://surendrashastram.blogspot.com)
and [surendra-shaastram.blogspot.com](http://surendra-shaastram.blogspot.com) .  
  
Perhaps if we don't analyse the presuppositions of the great masters in good time we shall not do justice to their masterly theses.Has not Bhartrihari himself given us the clue : yatnenaa 'numito 'py arthah kushalair anumaatribhih,abhiyuktatarair anyair anyathaivopapaadyate // ?  
  
Vidushaam vidheyah,
