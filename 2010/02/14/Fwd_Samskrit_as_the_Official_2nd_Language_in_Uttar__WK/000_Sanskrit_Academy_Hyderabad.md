Dear Samskrit Enthusiast Friend,

namaste. It is a historical day today for the lovers of Samskrit in  
our country. Please see the 2nd page of The Hindu for an advertisement  
by Samskrita Siksha Vibhaga of Uttarakhand Government about this  
announcement. It was said that it came in Times of India also. Perhaps  
in all major national newspapers.

We at Samskrita Bharati believe that this event needs to be celebrated  
by expressing our individual happiness to the Chief Minister of  
Uttakhand at Dehradun in the form of congratulatory letters, emails  
and other means of communication. Please also include your personal  
profile of 5-10 sentences in the mail/letter to indicate your genuine  
happiness. Wherever possible it would be great if you can use your  
letter head. If we can do this in the next week or fortnight, it would  
create a good impact. Perhaps we could mark copies to other important  
policy makers of our country as well.

Also please send articles/letters to all kinds of media giving your  
feedback about this event. Let us all show to the world that there are  
a large number of people loving Samskritam.

Also kindly share this important news with all like-minded friends and  
relatives of yours.

I will send you another mail in a couple of days with a scanned copy  
of the advt.

Looking forward to your valuable support for the upliftment of the  
great heritage of our country, Samskritam

Yours very truly,  
Krupalu, Principal Secretary, Samskrita Bharati, Hyderabad Region
