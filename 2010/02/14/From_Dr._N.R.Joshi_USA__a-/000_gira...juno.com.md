Respected Scholars, Namaskar!  
  
Nothing wrong in trying new paths in Sanskrit semantics.

First I would like to thank Dr. Surendramohan Mishra for open mind ready to read and ponder over new opinions. I read his blogs. Please give us Devanagari version of Sanskrit verses if possible.

I say nothing is wrong in trying to discover meanings to individual Sanskrit Varņas. It may work or it may not work. Scholars are welcome to support it or oppose it by giving appropriate references. I said this is controversial issue. Moreover I am not throwing something out without foundation. In the whole world scholars praised arrangement of Sanskrit Varņas according to their acoustic properties. This table serves as the foundation of my scheme.

I thank Dr. S Korad for giving details such as Mukhyartha, or GaunNartha and shades of meaning. I always learn from his postings. I say that meaning of a word has Umbra and Penumbra. Words are used differently by different authors. We have to take all this into consideration. Please let me know-do you see the meanings of /c/ and /L/ in the listed words or not?

Now I raise the objection. The meaning of the adjective Cañcala is unsteady. Now unsteady is very different from focused. The conclusion-the symbolism breaks down. I say no. The last phoneme of the row of palatals is the nasal sound of /ñ/ which has meaning ‘to defocus’ exactly opposite to that of /c/. The Cañcala means ‘focus and defocus and again focus’ (there are two /c/). I call that unsteady. The meanings of the phonemes in a row vary gradually from the left end, reaches its height at the third phoneme (/j/ in case of palatals) and then changes direction ending into ‘to defocus’ of the nasal /ñ/. The row acts like a semantic stretched string with the highest deflection at the center. And this works for all seven rows of Varņas (last two rows are rearranged).  
Here are my two hypotheses.  
First-Any possible one to one relationship between sound of Varņas and their corresponding intrinsic semantic categories must be consistent with acoustic properties of sounds (such as unaspirated, aspirated, voiced, voiced and aspirated and nasal for first five rows-for last two rows the fifth letter is not nasal).

Second-The systematic arrangement of Varņas according to their places of origin in human vocal tract suggests the possibility of existence of the underlying systematic network of their semantic categories.  
Such network needs to be discovered.

The sixth rearranged row is /y/, /r/, /v/, /L/ and /ś/. Earlier I explained the meaning “to stay within limits’ of /L/. Now the meaning of next /ś/ is one step ahead. It means ‘to decrease the amplitude, to taper off’. Examples.  
(1) śākhā-branch. The branch of a tree taper off.  
(2) śikhara-a peak of a mountain or temple tower. They taper off.  
(3) śam- The root means to be pacified, to subside. Its amplitude (extent) is decreased.  
(4) śīta-cold, cool. A cold object has decreased size (amplitude).  
(5) śańkha- A conch shell. It tapers down.  
(6) śunda-trunk of an elephant. It tapers down. The same is true for śoonyam, śāstram, śastra, śes'a (remainder), Rāśi, Raśmi. Śivam, Śuddha. The letter sound /ś/ can be anywhere in the word, the meaning is the same.

Now some scholars may not like me giving example from the ancient Indian story. Check yourself whether the meaning of /ś/ described above is present in the words śukra and śukrācārya or not? If one does not like the last example, he can ignore it. But the scheme works. All such previous efforts by westerners for their languages failed because they were guessed randomly giving some statistical support here and there. My scheme has solid foundation. The scheme also works for retroflexes proving their appropriate places both acoustically and semantically in the table of Varņas. Since it works like a semantic periodic table, after decoding of few letter-sounds ,it became easy to fill up the gaps just like unknown elements filling the gaps in chemical periodic table. Thanks. N. R. Joshi.
