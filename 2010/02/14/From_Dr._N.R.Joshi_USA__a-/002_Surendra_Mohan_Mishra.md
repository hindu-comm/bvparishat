Dear Colleagues,  
Namaskaarah.  
What Shri Shrivara says is welcome.Shrii Madhvaacaarya was a master of  
grammar and etymology and this he has employed to bring home his  
desired purport in Rigbhaashya,Giitaa or Bhaagavata.Many more have  
done similarly as Samskrit as a language is infinitely pregnant with  
semantic possibilities and very often syllables and letters volunteer  
to throw up a new meaning.As it is said in the tradition  
"abhinava-kalpanaa vrittih" : a gloss is worth it that construes and  
introduces hitherto unforeseen(!) meaning.  
At sentential level,yes,normally we settle for a wholesome sense,but  
at syllabic (varna) level , althoug some sense does emanate,we  
justifiably call it as "vague"in relation to the given sentential  
meaning and not otherwise.Could then not a sentential meaning be vague  
or partially true taking into account a whole context consisting of a  
cluster of sentences(mahaavaakya) or a whole book to consider ! Then  
even if a sentence holds good semantically,by extension of the same  
logic status of a syllable or letter as it's constituent ought to be  
(kindly!) considered.Why term individual bricks as unpurposeful which  
go into building a house ?Of course one would live in a house and not  
in a brick.But that's another matter.  
In this connection it's interesting to see N R Joshi trying to  
discover some patterns of viable semantic character usual to syllables  
and letters in an enumerative method : induction by enumeration ! In  
Tantric exegesis one comes across such signification.But then the  
question remains whether such assignment of sense is intrinsic to  
syllables or assigned following the freedom to stipulate ? I think  
both are there in the tradition.But to find out the former is a  
formidable task for the linguist.  
With warm regards,  
Surendramohan Mishra
