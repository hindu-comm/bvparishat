Respected Scholars, Namaskar!

I would like to thank Dr. Surndramohan Mishra for his open mindedness and his readiness to offer space for new thoughts. I am now giving few more examples. You decide to enjoy them or not.

Some examples of meanings of Retroflex phonemes according to my scheme of Phonemic symbolism.

The first letter-sound of the row of retroflexes is /ţ/. Its meaning is “to bow out” .  
Let us see examples:

Ţańkāra: It is the sound of plucked (bow out and released) tense string of a bow or any other tense string.  
Puşţa: A well built or plump(bow out) person.  
Tuşţa: A person with bowed out belly after good dinner indicates his satisfaction.  
Ghaţa: A round earthen jar. It has feature of bowing out.  
Muşţi: A clenched fist has fingers doubled into the palm, bowed out pattern.  
Paţ: The root means to split, to tear up. In the process bending or bowing out is involved.  
Paţavāsa: Tent. It is of course bowed out.  
Kaţikā: It means hip or buttocks. They show bowed out pattern.  
Ghaņţā: It means a bell. Look at its shape-bowed out.  
Ţīkā: It means commentary, gloss. Here one has to bow out metaphorically a certain literary work to bring out its subtle features.  
These ten examples are enough to illustrate the meaning.

The next retroflex letter-sound is /ţh/. Now one can easily guess its meaning if one knows my scheme. This is an aspirated sound. Its meaning is “to bow out little more”. Here are examples.  
Ţālinī: It means girdle tight fitting on hips or buttocks.  
Oşţha: Lips show bowing out pattern  
Kamaţha: a tortoise. Look at its back-bowed out.  
Kaņţha: The presence of Adam’s apple or projection of cartilage in front of one’s throat shows the same pattern.  
Pŗşţha: The back bone shows the chain of bowed out bones.  
Piţhara: A pot or pan. It has the same pattern.  
Śuņţhi: It means dry ginger root. The bumps on it shows the pattern.  
Sauţhava: A well built person with strong muscles bent out has excellent body Sauţhava.  
Now you can guess the meanings of three remaining retroflex sounds using the concept of semantic stretched string with nodes at the beginning and end phonemes and an antinode on the central phoneme.  
Here is one cultural example:  
Viţhţhal: This deity from Pandharapur(Maharashtra) is standing on a pair of bricks with arms bowed out at elbows and resting on his waist. Here the name of the deity is showing the meaning of /ţh/.  
Some people may object for cultural examples. They fit in my scheme perfectly well with other mundane, secular, material words. Let us not forget that Shaunaka in his Brihat Devata used ākhyāyikās as a tool for the purpose of canonical exegesis and for analysis of the linguistic components of mantric language linked to the notion of purposeful action. Laurie Patton has written book, “Myth as Argument”. She clearly stresses the point that ākhyāyikās were used to bring out subtle features of Sanskrit words. Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
