Esteemed Scholars,

Namaskaarah.

In respect of the conjectures put forth by Dr N R Joshi for arriving  
at semantic nature of individual letters may i suggest that the  
constituents of the known roots,prefixes and suffixes be studied to  
apprehend such meaning at an atomic level.

Secondly, Pandit Raghunandan Sharma in his Varna-Vijnaana book has  
assigned meanings to the individual letters which is of course  
debatable,but certainly it can provide some bright clues to further  
lend credence to our observation.

Could the statement "pada-prakritih samhitaa" in the  
Rik-praatishaakhya amount to "varna-prakritih samhitaa" whether by  
shashthii samaasa or bahubriihi ?Our sense of reductionism in language  
signification must end up at some atomic finals which should act as  
ultimate semantic space holders and their permutation and combination  
would lead to our approximate sense that a given language conveys.And  
is this tendency more so in Samskrit or Vedic Samskrit Chandas as N R  
Joshi earlier observed ??But in the Vedas also there are different  
stages of language highly visible !
