Respected scholars, Namaskar!

BVparishat list is quiet recently. It is a good idea to discuss new things even though they appear to be controversial. So I would like to raise a question. We know that different types of meanings are identified as Abhidhaa, LakshaNaa, Vyanjanaa and Taatparya. If somebody asks the question-why Abhidha (primary meaning of a word) is called "Abhidhaa" and not only "dhaa"?

Dictionary always offer many meanings to Upasargas (prefixes).We also know prefixes change meanings of roots forcibly (--balat anyatra neeyate). However if somebody asks the question-what is the difference between

Ruchi and Abhiruchi

Nava and Abhinava

Vyakti and Abhivyakti

Udaya and Abhyudaya and the first question

dhaa and Abhidhaa

We can list more pairs. These are enough for discussion. The third question is- does the prefix "Abhi" has exactly the same meaning in these pairs? If it is, what it would be? Thanks. N.R.Joshi
