Namo vidvadbhyah



it is nice of Dr Joshi to raise such issues for discussion. These are useful to many a person.



Abhidha - here the dhatu is ' du dhan = dharanaposanayoh. In striyam an(last letter of kavarga) -pratyaya is added only if prefixed

by an upasarga -- aatascopasarge (panini 3-3-106).



In Mahabhasya etc. the term abhidhaanam is used (anabhidhaanaat=since there is no usage of such a sabda)in the sense of

usage/prayoga. Abhidhaanam also means expression of meaning . The derivation for Abhidhaa can be abhidheeyate anayaa iti abhidhaa.



Here it is the name of a Vrtti by which the meaning is expressed.Naturally it will be the first meaning - vaacyaartha.



It may be noted that these names are not seen as they are either in Vyakarana or Nyaya(Vaisesika) or Mimamsa (in the originalworks). But the seeds are there in the said Sastras.



The bare 'dhaa' , which is a root and not a word cannot be used(as a word we have to search) as Patanjali (Anabhihite - Pan 2-3-1)

declares -- apadam na prayunjiita, na kevalaa prakrtih prayoktavyaa naapi pratyayah.



In other words usage or abhidhaanam is the authority -- prayogasaranam vyakaranam.



Ruchi means taste or interest . Abhiruchi is interest.



There are some Upasargas in certain usages which do not express any

meaning -- adhiparii anarthakau (Panini 1-4-93). Nava and abhinava are the same.



Vyaktih is generally used in the sense of Dravyam/object (Jaatyaakrtivyaktayastu padaarthah -- Nyayasutram) and Sattvam is a

synonym -- caadayo'sattve(Panini). Vyajyate anayaa iti vyaktih ( vi - ancu - ktin by 'striyaam ktin' -Pan).

Abhivyakti is clear expression.



Udaya means rising. Abhyudaya means prosperity (abhyudayena yujyate - Paspasa, Mahabhasyam, Purvamimamsa also).



As is obvious the 'abhi' doesn't have the same meaning all thru.
