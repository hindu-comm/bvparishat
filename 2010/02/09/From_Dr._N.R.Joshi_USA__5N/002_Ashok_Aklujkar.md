It seems that the following message went only to Dr. N.R. Joshi. So, I am resending it with the this addition: Historical study of the change of meaning of a word is by its very nature an uncertain undertaling. Rarely evidence for all stages is available, because not all speech is recorded (thank God!) and not all literature is preserved (again, thank God!), especially in such a way as to preserve the context that would enable us to recover the intended meaning precisely. The common mistake is to go on the assumption that what we see as the logical extension of a meaning is the historically extended/changed meaning. We have to think logically, but we also have to realise the limitations of such thinking, given the very circumstances in which our study takes place.  
  
  
**Earlier post:

The basic meaning of abhi is 'facing, turned toward.' Historically, it is cognate with 'amphi-, ambi-" (as in "amphitheatre," "ambiguous" etc. in English words) and "be-" in "befall" etc. From 'facing, turned toward' develop such senses as 'nearness, immediacy,' which, in turn, become intensifiers/emphasizers in some cases. In the course of time or through over-use, the shade of intensification is lost.  
  
In the following article, you will find one more example:  
Aklujkar, Ashok. 1990. "saµbandha and abhisaµbandha." Journal of Indian Philosophy 17: 299-307.  
  
The above explanation does not obviate the need to study to study the history of each word individually.  
  
abhidhaa 'put/place something in such a way as it will face (something else)' comes to mean 'express, state' very much like the English pairing of 'put" and "forward" in 'put forward.'
