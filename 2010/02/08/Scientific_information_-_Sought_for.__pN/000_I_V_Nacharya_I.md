Dear Scholar Friends,  
praNamyA. I want to seek some scientific information from any one of our  
scholar friends. It is said in the scriptures that we should not look at the rising Sun. "nEkShEtOdyanta MaadityaM" is the sentence I saw some-where in our Scriptures.I request our scholar friends to kindly enlighten  
me in this regard.  
Regards,  
I.V.Nacharya.\<[ivi...@yahoo.co.in]()\>
