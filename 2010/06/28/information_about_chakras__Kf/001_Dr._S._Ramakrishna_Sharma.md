Dear Aspirant,

  
  
\>Now I am looking for more information about shatchakras and their impact on human health.   

\>if any text of tantra throws some light on this subject.  

**योगेन चित्तस्य पदेन वाचां मलं शरिरस्य च वैद्यकेन ।  
योपाकरोत्तं प्रवरं मुनीनां पतञ्जलिं प्राञ्जलिरानतोस्मि  ।।**  
**The above verse points at the integral and interrelated nature of three disciplines viz, Yoga, Ayurveda and VyAkaraNam for shuddhi, a concept which is not familiar to Western approach to health. **  
अन्नमयप्राणमय ........आत्मा मे शुदध्यन्तां ज्योतिरहं विरजा विपात्मा भूयासं \\ स्वाहा **This series of mantras in Taittiriiya and many other mantras also indicate that without tri-karaNa-shuddhi spiritual refinement and expansion of consciousness is not possible.  
Whether it is Veda lore or Tantra lore, the study of the auxiliary disciplines such as shadangaas and upa-Vedas is a must. This alone helps the aspirant to grasp in a sweep the references spread across the spiritual literature about any topic related to life. I request you to consider joining the following group:  
**<http://groups.google.co.in/group/foundation-for-indian-scientific-heritage>**  
where this topic of specific reference can be discussed further if you find the need after going through the discussions, files and pages.**  
**Many New World/Age therapies like color therapy, chakra therapy,vibration therapy use the concepts and precepts of Tantra(often wrongly, like Tantric sex)extensively. A Google search will be profitable.  
Specialization at the cost of integral and holistic approach and fanciful innovations like Tantric dance have given rise to a lot of trash whereas chakra healing, cleansing,clearing and many terms and coinages help in a limited way to understand the impact of chakras(the number is not limited to six, depending upon the prakriya followed in the text and context) on human health.  
The best means of learning these would be( and this cannot be substituted) the mode of experiential learning under the direct supervision and with direct contact of an accomplished Master. Your UpAsanaa will lead you to such a Master.  
Maha-sArasvata-Kundalini-Yoga of Dr.J.C BhAratiiya (in two or more volumes, of which I have studied only the first) provides very useful prescriptions of herbs and mantras to heal the chakra mal/hyper functions. This book was available in a book stall in Hardwar(which I got in 1976 and lost in 1985, having given for reference to some one).
