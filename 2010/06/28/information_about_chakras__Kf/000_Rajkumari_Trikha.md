Dear scholar-friends,

I am a yoga aspirant and have read and written about ashtanga-yoga and practised it at the feet of my siddha-gurudeva. Now I am looking for more information about shatchakras and their impact on human health. I want to know through this forum if any text of tantra throws some light on this subject. I have gone through Shivasamhita, Shatchakranirupana, The serpent power and some more original texts of Hathyoga. I shall be obliged if the required information is given to me. With regards and waiting for favourable response,

Rajkumari Trikha
