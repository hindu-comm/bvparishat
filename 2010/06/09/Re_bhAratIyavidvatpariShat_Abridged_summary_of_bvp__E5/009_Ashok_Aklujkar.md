If the intention is to arrive at a historically sound or plausible etymology (as distinct from a folk or unscientific etymology), the forms of a word attested in different times must be taken into account and the laws of sound change must be respected as far as possible. Where the relevant laws do not fully apply, the etymology should be presented only as one possibility among many or as a case of borrowing by language-1 from language-2, or an attempt to formulate the sound change laws in a more specific way should be made.

Does ;Saciindra really occur? Does it occur as a person's name? Is it intended as a dvandva compound? If it is, it is unlikely to be a single person's name. If it is not so intended and means 'Lord of ;Sacii." do we come across names such lak.smiindra, Umendra etc. as distinct from ;Sacii-pati, Lak.smii-pati, Umaa-pati etc.?

satya becomes sacca in Pali and Prakrit; saccaa in Hindi etc. Therefore, Sacin/Sachin is possible from Satyen (\<-- Satyendra).

puur.nimaa must historically have been puur.namas 'full moon' Cf. the derivative (paur.namaasa -->) paur.namaasii. The -mas must be the same as -mas at the end of candramas, which originally did not mean 'moon' but 'shining moon.' Cf. Mayrhofer, M., KEWA, p. 373. That mas originally a noun is confirmed also by Persian maah as in maahataab and by maasa 'month'. (The word candra, on the contrary was originally an adjective meaning 'shining'.)

Thus the puzzle of svar.nima cannot be solved by bringing in puur.nimaa.
