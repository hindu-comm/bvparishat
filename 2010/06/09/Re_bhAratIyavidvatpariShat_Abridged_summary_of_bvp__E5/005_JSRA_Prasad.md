Some time ago, a parent wanted to name his male baby and interested in the word 'Tankishk'  
I've been asked to confirm the meaning. I'd searched on net and found some clues. In olden days,  
one of the coins used was '*nishka*', also means an ornament made out of gold or silver. The TATAs  
picked up this word prefixed with the initial two characters ('TA') in TATA to form the word 'Tanishk'.  
So, its a coined word for their jewellery shops.
