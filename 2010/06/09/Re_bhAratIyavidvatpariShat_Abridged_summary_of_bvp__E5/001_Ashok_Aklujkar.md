These names are a result of continuing prakritization (loss of conjunct consonants, loss of consonants between vowels, overall simplification of the phonemics of Sanskrit etc.) as well as growing ignorance of Sanskrit. Parents are aware of the importance of giving auspicitous Sanskrit-sounding names to their children but increasingly are unaware of the Sanskrit connection and meaning. They just go by sound (instead of sound and meaning; analogy plays a big role) and fashion.

The etymologies are not always clear. Here are my guesses:

Nitin \<-- Nityen \<-- Nityendra/Niitindra

Niiteesh \<-- Niite;sa (compare Niile;sa)

Sachin \<-- Satyen \<-- Satyendra

Jatin \<-- Yatin \<-- Yatiindra.

The last one has been current in Bengal for about two hundred years now.
