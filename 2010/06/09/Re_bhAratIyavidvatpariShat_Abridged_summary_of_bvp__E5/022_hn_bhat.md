Thanks for the information from the Trilingual Dictionary.

  

But the wordपूर्णि is not found in Monier Williams or DCM mentioned therein as synonym to Full moon day. May be possible to derive with the suffix णिङ्. with some उणादि ruleif it is attested in their sources.I could not find it in among Paninian suffixes as a primary derivative suffix. There is a similar suffix णिङ् which is used to modify the verb kam "कमु कान्तौ" in form but not in meaning. Also there isणिङ् used to derive nominal verbs (नामधातु) from certain words.

  

Well I found the word पूर्णि in a Hindi dictionary with the similar derivation meaning given as पूर्णिमा।

  

The following etymology according Paninian system offerred by Khiraswamy seems to be similar to explanation and etymology offered in the dictionary cited :



पूरणं पूर्णिः, \[भावे क्तिन्\]; ’ऋल्वादिभ्यः क्तिन्निष्ठावद्वाच्यः ’ (वा) इति (निष्ठाणत्वम्।); पूर्णिं मिमीते पूर्णिमा; ("माङ् माने" +)कः (+टाप्।)

(Amara with Amarakoshodghatana p.21; 1.3.7)

  

The words in brackets added by me for completeness of the explanation.

  

This is the alternative derivation offered by Bhanuji Dikshita:

  

पूरी आप्यायने (दिवादिः सेट्), + भावे क्तः \>\>

पूर्णम् - चन्द्रस्य पूरणम्। तेन निवृत्ता \>\> पूर्णिमा। ’तेन निवृत्तम्’
इत्यर्थे इमप् (४.४.२०). टाप्।

व्याख्यासुधा (on अमर१.४.७)

  

It is the same root for both the commentators and the same meaning "bhava" accepted by both for the word पूर्ण or पूर्णि derived with different suffixes and none of them attested the meaning Full moon Day. and it is"Tthe act of making full or fat" seems to be the meaning accepted by the two commentators.
