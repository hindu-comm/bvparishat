**In western standards proper names are non-connotative.But ours,its highly connotative and sensitive a matter.One of the sacraments in our tradition is naming a child.But now as rightly said by Prof. Aklujkar,ignorance of Sanskrit is the cause in choosing names which render only 'bhramaat shaabdabodha'.  
A descendant of a Sanskrit family,a lady once told me her new baby son's name to delight me that it was a good Sanskrit name.It was 'Purvadeva' which made me laugh as she happened to be a sister-in-law of mine ! Next day she changed the name with a fresh havan. Regards,SMM**
