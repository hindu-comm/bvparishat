\> Yes, we find the name Lakhindar (\<Lak.smiindra\< Lak.smii-indra), husband of Behulaa, in the legend of Manasaa, a goddess of serpents, specially available in the Ma.ngalakaavyas of Bengali literature; name Satiindra (\<Satii-indra) is also given to a person in eastern region.

A Google search reveals that there are many people called Shachindra, so that personal name does occur fairly widely (ditto for Lakshmindra and Umendra). It is not clear from what texts the names are derived, but names in general are usually given by imitation, and the textual or historical basis is often not directly apparent.
