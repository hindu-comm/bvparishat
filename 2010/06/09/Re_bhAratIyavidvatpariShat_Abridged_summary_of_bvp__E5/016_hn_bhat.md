Just a note in this regard with due respect to Mr. Subrahmanya's most well-based remark on Sanskrit Grammar and Language..

  

Paninian Grammar is meant mainly for the usages in Sanskrit Language and not for the words in other languages though some sort of tadbhava or tatsama-s are used in most of the Indian Languages. It seems an effort is made here to trace the origin of such shabda-s or apashabda-s used in the other languages to some possible origin in Sanskrit language if possible at all. There need not be any certainty even in the case of dittha- etc. in the sanjna- words in Sanskrit language itself. Then why should we beat around the bush to trace the origin or derivation of such sanj\~jna words used in other languages to Sanskrit? In Paninian system itself the derivations given by Shakatayana are accepted tentatively, Unadayo bahulam even though they are well established words in Sanskrit language. But generally it is accepted that the words derived with Unadi suffixes can be considered as "avyutpanna-praatipadika-s for Paninian standards.

  

With regards .
