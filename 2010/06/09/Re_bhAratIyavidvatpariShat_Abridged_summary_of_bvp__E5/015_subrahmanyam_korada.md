namo vidvadbhyah



we have to keep in mind a couple of guidelines offered by Patanjali in terms of Prayoga --



1.astyaprayukta iti saahasamaatrameva, mahaan sabdasya visayah - saptadviipaa vasumatii, ........catvaaro vedaah ... etaavantam sabdasya prayogam ananunisamya 'santyaprayuktaa' iti vacanam kevalam saahasamaatrameva (Paspasaa -- Mahabhasyam)  


2\. na hi vacih antiparah prayujyate (i.e. there is no usage of a word like 'vacanti' , although it can be derived from

Panini ).



3\. Prsodaraadiini yathopadistam (6-3-109) - prsodara, jimuuta etc (prsodaraprakaaraani ) which are not analysed

by Panini but in currency across Aryavarta have to be taken as authoritative .



There are a number of discussions across Panini in this regard.



Vacaspatimisra said there is no striilinga of the word 'kusa' , but it is there in Veda (Praudhamanoramaa).  


Since the word 'sacin' can be derived from Panini I offered the analysis .



'samavaayaan samavaiti '(Pan 4-4-43) - is the usage . Samavaaya - means - samghah . It can be one who

moves closely in a society (samavaiti) and the striilinga and napumsaka are okay . In striilinga it is aadyudaatasvara due to pittva (rnnebhyo niip ( Pan 4-1-5 ).



I tried for nitin and nitiis but it was not possible as per Panini . Bhayakara did not say these are Apasabdas, rather

I quoted Bhasyam to show that the word 'mleccha ' means 'apasabda' .



Certain words like the ones mentioned that are in currency now-a-days can be analysed and others are not .

We have to examine case by case .



a careful study of the main Vyakaranagranthas gives me the opinion that it is impossible for one to offer the gamut of Sabdas vis-a-vis Apasabdas .



'Visraamam' ( Malatimadhavam &Sakuntalam ) is possible according to Candravyakarana but not Panini .
