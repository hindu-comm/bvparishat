**Esteemed Scholars,  
Here is a query from an enthusiast.  
\>**ancient Indian Plant treatment Methods.Can you approve this title?  
  
**Reply:** "ancient, Indian, Plant, treatment,Methods" do not sound good and mean well.  
You may rearrange the words to make the title more communicative and clear.  
Like: Plant Treatment - Ancient Methods in India.  
  
But what is your experience in this field? Can you support your paper with practical records  
you have maintained? Preferably photos/videos with your authentic active presence will help  
you to face the queries from the audience. Do you find these methods economically practical today?  
How many people are practicing them?  
You have to define the purpose and scope of your paper.  
Mere narration is of little value. Can you correlate/compare  
the ancient methods with modern methods to emphasize the advantage  
of the former over the latter, if any.  
  
That person does not belong to the Science mainstream at PG&Ph.D level.  
Academic rigor and intellectual honesty are indeed qualities!  
  
प्रणाम:
