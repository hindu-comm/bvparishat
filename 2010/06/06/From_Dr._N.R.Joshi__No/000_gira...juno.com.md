Errors corrected.

Because of outside hot weather and hot inside the booth of Internet cafe, Errors were made in my message. I am correcting them now.

June 5, 2010

Respected scholars, Namaskar!  
I had honor to meet scholars Dr. Amba Kulkarni and Dr. Sub. Korada on May 31 2010. I am  
thankful to them for giving me opportunity through seminar to present my views on  
Sanskrit. It was great opportunity to have interaction with scholars of Univ of  
Hyderabad.

bvprshat is powerful instrument to bring Sanskrit and Indology scholars from the world on  
single platform to exhange views.

I attended "All India Oriental Conference" in Tirupati. I presented paper on  
"Mahabharat-History or Mythology-Sarasvaties outside of Indian subcontinent"

Thanks. to all. I am in India (Pune) until the end of June. I am enjoying my visit to India.
