It is not the isolate instance in the epic literature. There are some others also to which human codes of conduct may not apply for establishing their legitimacy.  

  

The sage Vasishtha is called Maitra-varuna born to two fathers Mitra and Varuna. And Budha son of Candra, the Moon and Tara, who is the legitimate wife of Brihaspati (the teacher of Deva-s) but kidnapped by Chandra (on account of which a fight amounting to communal clashes supporting both Brihaspati and Chandra). Dhritara-shtra (the father of Kauravas) and Pandu (the father of Pandava-s) were born by the wives of Chithra Virya and Vichitra Virya to the great Sage Vyasa himself. Even though Pandu is an attributive name, all of the the sons of Pandu are called collectively Pandu-putra-s. Individually, they are referred to as Dharma-putra (born to Yamadhama), Vayu-putra (Bheema), Indra-sunu (Arjuna) and are popular by the names.

  

And what about Kumbhasambhava or Agasthya? So RishyaShringa?

  

There may be allegorical interpretations to Puranic legends. But appying these to popularly lknown episodes like the above may not make much sense. In these cases, I think it would be take them as representing exceptional customs or overriding general codes of conduct applicable to all communities.

  

I remember having read on some web page that there is a village called Pandavapura where the women is legally authorised to marry more than husbands like Draupadi which custom may or may not be traced back to some community or developed after the episode of Draupadi. In other other standards, women having contact of with more than one man are considered as jaara. But Draupadi, Ahalya, Kunti and Tara (either the wife of Vali or Brihaspati) are considered as the most chaste maidens than wives:

  

A traditional Sanskrit exhortation runs thus: Ahalya Draupadi Kunti Tara Mandodari tatha panchakanya svaranityam mahapataka nashanam//

  

Remembering ever the virgins five Ahalya, Draupadi, Kunti, Tara and Mandodari Destroys the greatest sins.

  

Any comments? Now considering this, how to call Maruti (Hanuman, son of Maruta, born to Anjana, the wife of Kesari) as Kunda? Especially, he is popularly known as Anjaneya and Maaruti. If so what about Bheema, the son of Vayu (Maruta)?

  

These are only instances cited offhand without going deeply into the epic literature, because of their popularity as heros or heroins in epic literature. Many other similar ones may be found under ground to be unearthed.

  

Most valuable opinions of other scholars are solicited in this respect.
