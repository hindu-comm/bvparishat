Dear scholars,



       In Bhasa's Abhisheka drama it is stated that Hanumana is alegitimateson of God Maruta.But Anjana was not the Dharma patni of Vayu. She was a wife of Kesari Vanara. AurasoDharma patni jaha. So Hanuman kan not be a legitimate son but a kunda son. Please give your valuableopinion.
