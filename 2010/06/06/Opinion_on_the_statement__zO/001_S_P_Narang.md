Dear all: In the family to which Hanuman belonged, so called Aryan Dharmasastra system was less known. So was the tradition of the Arthasastra. The difference to some extent has been given by Mitaksara on the Yajnavalkya. so contradictory statements. The example is Sugriva and Tara after the death of Bali.It is different in North and south traditions. Later dharmasastrins tried to make it and other stories coherent with their system. Comparison of the versions of the Critical edition may help to come to a conclusion. A few anthropologists say that it is pre-historic semi-developed law. One may investigate on this line also.

--  
अथ चेत्त्वमिमं धर्म्यं संग्रामं न करिष्यसि।  
ततः स्वधर्मं कीर्तिं च हित्वा पापमवाप्स्यसि।।  
तस्मादुत्तिष्ठ कौन्तेय युद्धाय कृतनिश्चयः।  
निराशीर्निर्ममो भूत्वा युध्यस्व विगतज्वरः।। (भ.गी.)
