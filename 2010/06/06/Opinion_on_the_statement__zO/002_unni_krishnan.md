I feel that every thing contained in epics and purANAs should not be taken in it's verbal sense. So many philosophical and symbolic representation are there. The western commentators meant Indra as a leader of some aryan gotra onlybecause they were unaware of this Indian tradition of vedic interpretation . We can come to any conclusion in such places ,in a higher sense only. Not in the ordinary meaning.
