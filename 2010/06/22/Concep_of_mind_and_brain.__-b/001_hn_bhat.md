Thanks for all those who contributed to this discussion in their own way. I myself could not remember any reference to a word precisely referring to brain than manas, citta etc. I just made a search for the word brain in Cologne Digital Dictionary and got these results of Sanskrit words:  
  
3mastakaluGgam. or n. (?) the membrane of the brain L. (cf. %{mastuluGga}).  
  
4mastakasneham. \`" hñhead-marrow "' , the brain L.  
  
5mastakodbhavam. \`" produced in the head "' , the brain L.  
  
6 mastiSkam. n. the brain RV. &c. &c. ; any medicine or substance acting upon the brain Sus3r.  
  
7mastiSkatvacf. the membrane surrounding the brain MW.  
  
8mastuluGgaor m. n. the brain Sus3r. S3a1rn3gS. (cf. %{mastaka-luGga}).  
9mastuluGgakam. n. the brain Sus3r. S3a1rn3gS. (cf. %{mastaka-luGga}).  
  
The following references to **mastiShka** are obtained from DCSHeidelberg  
  
All references  
  
Carakasaṃhitā1/94337  
Kālikāpurāṇa1/4091  
Rājanighaṇṭu1/49141  
Suśrutasaṃhitā4/145993  
Vetālapañcaviṃśatikā1/977  
Śira'upaniṣad1/1569  
  

Here is the link to the results page wherein the exact references could be seen from the texts collected in database:

It is most probable that the words would be looked for in Ayurveda texts (as can be seen from the above references) and less probable in other forms of literature. The other words are derived from either from mastaka- head and mastu (meaningsour cream (MW) andthe watery part of curds (MW) resembling brain in form).

  

Hope this may be of some help in this direction of the discussion.
