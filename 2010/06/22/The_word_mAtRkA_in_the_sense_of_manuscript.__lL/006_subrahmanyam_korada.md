namo vidvadbhyah



First let us take the word 'mAtr' that has got the secondary sense , i.e. mAtr, which means 'mUlam' or

the word 'mAtr' which means - the one whch measures , i.e. pramAnam (to decide the authenticity of copies / pratikrtis,i.e. anything having the same form made of skin, hay, wood etc., including xerox ).



In the former it will be - mAtA (mother who is the origin) iva mAtr .



Why so ? The word mAtA (strIlinga) is a Sambandhisabda(see - Pradipa etc on -devadattasya gurukulam under 'samarthah padavidhih'(Panini 2-1-1) andjust like its svArtha , it is always associated with AkAnksA / apeksA

(who is pitA ?) . Here is Hari --



sambandhisabdsh sApekso nityam sarvah prayujyate I svArthavatsA vyapeksAsya vrttAvapi na hIyate II

 47, Vrttisamuddesa, Padakanda, Vakyapadiyam



VrttAvapi means in a Vrtti also . We are dealing with Taddhitavrtti . Such sabdas always expect another

sabda . To avoid such a controversy and strictly follow the SAstra , we have to take 'aupacArikasabda'



Any such usage ? - nadImAtrkA (aurable land which depends on river waters) and devamAtrkA (aurable land

that depends on rain water - devo varsati ) bhUmih .



So since it the original (prakrti) rather than copy (pratikrti) - ive pratikrtau (Pan 5-3-96) cannot be applied .



If it is considered as a SamjnA (in the sense of non-pratikrti only) then - samjnAyAm ca (Pan 5-3-97) can be

applied . Then SAdrsya is with 'mAtA' (strIlinga). It is not 'asva' but 'like asva', so 'asvaka'. Similarly, this

mAtr is like mAtA (mother). Pratyaya is not on mAtr(mother) but on mAtr (mUlam) in SvArtha .



On the other hand, since it is accepted that - following the guideline that Panini employed Bahuvacanam in

the SUtra - 'taddhitAh' (Pan 4-1-76, compare with kartari krt 3-4-67) there are some 'anuktataddhitAh' .For example - svargagrAmatikAvilunthana .....(Hanumannatakam, example for the dosa called ' avimrstavidheyAmsa) - here 'tikan' is an anuktataddhita, kan here is an anuktataddhita .Or put it in 'prsodarAdIni yathopadistam'(Pan 6-3-109) following 'nadImAtrkA' etc. .
