An additional information:  
वेङ्कटरङ्गस्वामिन् says एतन्मातृकात्रयाधारेण एकां पुत्रिकां निष्पाद्य  
in his भूमिका written to his edition of आख्यातचन्द्रिका by भट्टमल्ल  
(चौखाम्बा प्रकाशनं, काशी 1904). Obviously, here मातृका means exemplar  
and पुत्रिका is edited work. Even in the verse of Vedantadeshika  
quoted in my previous post, मातृका can be taken in the sense of  
exemplar which is very near to manuscript.

\> Dear scholars,  
\> The question raised by Dr.Jagannatha once troubled me too. I request colleagues to forgive some personal reminiscences that might throw light on the question raised. I first saw the use of the term मातृका for manuscripts in family circles by Durgamohan Bhattacharyya. I never asked him about this. Later in the seventies I saw that some of my teachers in Navyanyaaya in Varanasi used the word only in the sense of alphabet. Now, Professor Ananta Lal Thakur used the term in the sense of manuscript. I asked him how the use came into being. His short reply was the word was used in that sense in the South.  
\> Now Durgamohan Bhattacharyya was a student of Lakshmana Shastri Dravida in his early life. It is possible that he learnt the use very early from his guru. He seems to have been somewhat responsible for the term becoming popular in eastern Indian circles.  
\> I am sorry for dragging in personal experience in a scholarly forum. But that was unavoidable.
