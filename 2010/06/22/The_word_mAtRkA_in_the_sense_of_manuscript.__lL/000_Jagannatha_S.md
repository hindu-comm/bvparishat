Dear scholars, this is very well known that the word मातृका used in  
the sense of alphabet as seen in the स्तोत्रs like मातृकास्तोत्रs.  
But in Sanskrit, scholars use this word even in the sense of  
Manuscript as in the word मातृकासंपादनविज्ञानम् (Manuscriptology). I  
have found only one reference for confirming this usage in  
Yaadavaabhudaya in Vedantadeshika.  
लिलेख विश्वानि जगन्त्यभिज्ञा लीलाहृते चित्रपटे यथार्थम्। प्रायः  
प्रजानां पतयः प्रतीता यन्मातृकाः स्वेषु विधिष्वभूवन्।। (यादवाभ्युदये  
2.15) \[Devaki became pregnant. Since Lord Krishna was in her  
belly, she became omniscient and started to paint all the  
worlds. Her painting was seemingly so perfect as if it was  
exemplar for Prajaapatis to create their worlds\]. Vide commentary  
of Appayadikshita: :यन्मातृकाः यो देवकीलिखितचित्रपटो मातृका येषां  
तथाभूताः सन्तः.....प्रजापतीनामपि जगत्सृष्टावनया लिखितचित्रपटः प्रायो  
मातृकाभूदित्युत्प्रेक्षा।  
Now, my questions:  
1. मातृका means alphabet. My guess is, the thing on which मातृका is  
written is also मातृका by उपादानलक्षणा. Am I right or wrong? If  
right, is there any confirmation proof? If wrong, what is the  
reason?  
2.Can we trace any other reference for the word मातृका the meaning of  
which is manuscript (unambiguous and specific)?  
3.What is the exact meaning of the word मातृका in the usages like  
व्यवहारमातृकाप्रकरणम्, अभिधावृत्तिमातृका ?
