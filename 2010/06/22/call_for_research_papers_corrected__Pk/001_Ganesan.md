Dear Sri Subrahmanyam,

I am glad to receive the notification calling for papers for the forthcoming volume. I am preparing one and please reservespace for me in the forthcoming issue. !!



You have stipulated that the English text should be in Times NewRoman font. As you know well, this font lacks certain letters with diacritical marks and thereforeit isnothandy for us, Sanskritists.

Could I suggest to you thatwe can type the text in any unicode font, say, Gandhari Unicode or some such one, which is best suited for typing Sanskrit or Tamil words and passages in roman ?

I would like to have your final decision in this matter.

With the best wishes,

Ganesan
