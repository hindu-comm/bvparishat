namo vidvadbhyah



manyate iti manah -- mana = jnAne (divAdi - anudAttet , sarvadhAtubhyo'sun ,nitsvara - UnAdi - pAda 4)



PAninIyasiksA : how varnas are produced ?



AtmA buddhyA sametyArtAn mano yunte vivaksayA I manah kAyAgnimAhanti sa prerayati mArutam II etc.

Here AtmA means antahkaranam (since VaiyAkaranas follow SAmkhyadarsanam) . AtmA antahkaranam samskArarUpena svagatAn arthAn buddhyA svavrttyA sametya ekabuddhivisayAn krtvA tadbodhanecchayA

mano yuktam karoti ( Laghusabdendu - samjnA).



The commentators thereupon say - manasah antahkaranAsavisesarUpatayA antahkaranavrttIcchayA

manaso yogah . AtmA - antahkaranam - manas are employed as synonyms .



It is first BauddhArtha (jnAnam concealed in the antahkaranam ) and when one wants to speak then the

related image is revealed in Buddhiand the Manas is joined with vivaksA .



SAmkhyAnAm mate jnAnAdeh antahkaranavrttitvam .



NaiyAyikAnAm mate manasah icchAsrayatvam and anutvam .



VedAnta is already quoted and there is Vivarana - antahkaranavrttau jnAnatvopacArAt .



For Bauddhas and Jainas it is VijnAnam ( VAkya , VAkyArtha etc. also) . Here it means mAnasikam .



(in VedAnta jnAnam, vijnAsnam and prajnAnam are used as synonyms - see SAnkarabhAsyam - Adhy 1) .



In Veda manas is identified with Gunas - kAmassmkalpovicikitsAsraddhA ... mana eveti .

  
In VyAkarana Patanjali follows the general norm that Indriyas associated with manas generate jnana -

vaiyAkaranAnAm sAkatAyana gacchantam sArtham nopalebhe , kutah ? manasah asAnnidhyAt (roughly).



AlamkArikas call this - stambhAvasthA -- SAkuntalam - vicintayantI yamananyamAnasA taponidhim vetsi

na mAmupasthitam.



In MAlatImAdhava , BhavabhUti takes up ' antahkaranatattva' of dampatI to define 'apatyam'.



In JyotissAstra - there will be Lagna (rAsInAmudayo lagnam) and (Candra-) RAsi . In other words , Ravi

speaks about the physical body ( AtmA saktih svabhAvasca pitrcintA raveh phalam - KArakanighntu - MuhUrta-

dIpikA) and Candra the mind (candramA manaso'jAyata - Yajurveda) . Therefore , one should take both

Lagna and RAsi into consideration and try forecasting . If a person is born in KarkAtakalagna (Candra is

the Lord) he would have two kinds of extreme (superior and inferior) mentality . Fifth house from Lagna speaks

about Buddhi .



Yoga is quoted but cittam and manas are synonyms (see Amarakosa) .



Ayurveda -- CarakasamhitA says ( Ca. SUtra. 30-4) AtmA ca sagunascetascintyam ca hrdi samsritam .



Caraka offers adhyAtmadravya-guna-samgraha (SUtra - 13) - mano mano'rtho buddhirAtmA cetyadhyAtmagunasamgrahah . Indriyabuddhi, according to Caraka , is different from manobuddhi .

He also rules - manasastu cintyamarthah (1-16) .



In Susruta (SUtrasthAnam 1-34) says that there are MAnasika rogas due to krodhasoka etc. - ts ete manassarIrAdhisthAnAh .



There are two components - body and mind . Manas(Mind) is situated in brain and any kind of knowledge or passion (jnAna or bhAva etc) is associated with manas. First it is jnAnam and then speech .
