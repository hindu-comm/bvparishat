Uttamuura T. Viira-raaghavacaarya was an extraordinarily accomplished scholar and an impressive religious personality of the twentieth century. A defender of Vi;si.s.taadvaita, he wrote several important commentaries and independent works. Elucidating those works of Vedaanta-de'sika (also known as Ve:nka.ta-naatha, Ve:nka.taarya) which did not have inherited or sufficiently detailed commentaries was his particular accomplishment. He was also unusual among traditionally trained commentators in that he sometimes showed awareness of the relevant findings of Indological research of his time and occasionally did not hesitate to show preference for historical explanations of anomalies in the available textual evidence (e.g., the unavailability of the Sa:nkar.sa-kaa.n.da leading to the postulation of a Devataa-kaa.n.da in certain works of the Vedaanta tradition). Editing the Ubhaya-Vedaanta Grantha-maalaa should also be considered as one of his great accomplishments (here "ubhaya" is used to indicate inclusion of Skt as well as Tamil texts).

After a great deal of effort I was able to determine that Viira-raaghavacaarya was born in 1897. I still have not been able to locate a mention of his death in the resources available to me. He must have lived a reasonably long life, since he was, as I recall, one of the recipients of the Presidential honours (probably [Padma-bhuu.sa.na](http://Padma-bhuu.sa.na)) in the 1970's or a little earlier. The early issues of the Sahitya Akademy periodical Sa.msk.rta-pratibhaa may contain a few of his compositions, but I am not sure that they do.

(The hybrid name Sahitya Akademy is symptomatic of what is happening to Indian languages. Should someone not start a movement to have that name changed to something like Sahitya Prabodhini / Prabodhika?)
