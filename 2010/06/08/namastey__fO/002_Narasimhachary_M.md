Dear friends: In continuation of the write up on the life and works of Sri U.Ve. Uttamur Veeraraghavachariar Swami I have immense pleasure and pride in adding a few more details. The present writer had the good fortune of studying some of the works of Sri Yamunacharya (grand teacher of Sri Ramanuja) at thefeet of this great savant of Visistadvaita, during 1963-67. This helped him prepare the thesis "Contribution of Sri Yamunacharya to Visistadvaita", under the guidance of Dr V. Raghavan,which was awarded the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Sanskrit by the University of Madras in the year 1967 .  
  
TheSwamiwas living at 25, Nathamuni Street, T. Nagar, Chennai 17. He was holding several significant titles like Panditaratna, Tarkarnava, Abhinava Desika and Ubhaya Mimamsa Vallabha, His works, minor and major, are listed around 1000. He was a walking encyclopaedia and expert on several sastras including Bauddha Nyaya. He was born on 26-1-1897 and passed away on the 28th April 1983.  
  
The Swami was an embodiment of simplicity and humility in spite of his prodigious learning. He was teaching Istasiddhi to the late-lamented Senior Pontiff of the Kanchi Kamakoti Pitham at the latter's request.
He was the first recipient of the Certificate of Honour for Sanskrit from the President of India. Severalwell knownscholars like Sri U.Ve. Srivatsankacharya Swamin and Dr N.S. Ramanuja Tatacharya Swaminhave beenhis students.
