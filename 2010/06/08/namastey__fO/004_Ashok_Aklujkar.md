Many thanks to Prof. Narasimhachary for filling the gaps in the information I had aboutSri U.Ve. Uttamur Veeraraghavachariar Swami. I particularly appreciate receiving information about the date on which the great scholar (and more importantly a great human being) passed away. Having spent most of my life outside India (i.e., as a nirvaasita scholar!), I frequently do not know the persons from whom I can possibly obtain the information I need.

  

(Getting no responses from the librarians, curators and persons in charge of university and research institute publications is also a common experience. The sloppy way in which many research publications refer to their sources is often a nuisance rather than help; names of authors and titles are printed inconsistently; honorary titles alone are used in the place of real-life names as if the person/source meant is known to everyone; editions and places of publication are not specified; the wording is ambiguous or incomplete at crucial places, and so on).

  

Has any effort been made to collect all the published and unpublished writings of Viira-raaghavaacaarya in one place and to make digital copies of them, particularly of the unpublished works, including any notebooks he may have left behind?

  

Pandits of the stature ofViira-raaghavaacaarya have become an almost extinct species. It is an urgent need of the time to collect the notebooks, unpublished kaavyas etc. of the ;saastrins and pa.n.ditas of the last few generations. Requests for such materials should be published periodically in Indian newspapers for a few years. At least one library specializing in modern Sanskrit literature should be created at a central place in India. Where appropriate, the modern Indian language translations andelucidationsof uncommonly studied pre-modern Sanskrit works should be included in such a library / such libraries. For several years I have made this suggestion to a trust that gives a generous award for modern writing in Sanskrit. Nothing has come off it so far. Perhaps the Sanskrit Universities can take up the project, with the stipulation that they create mutually accessible electronic catalogues of their acquisitions and agree to share their library resources.
