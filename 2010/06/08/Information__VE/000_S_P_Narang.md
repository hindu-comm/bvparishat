To all scholars: with regards, I need the information "Bibliography of Bibliographies" consisting of the enries/entry on Kalidasa. I have huge material in my collection but due to the non-availablility of the books in Indian libraries, it is difficult to check the real status. If any scholar has such information with him/his institution/college/University or public library, kindly let me know. Many books I saw in the libraries of USA. For them also I want confirmation again. I am finalizing my work on the topic. Regards, spnarang
