Dear Sreesha and all,

  

In this search result (culled out of of Digital Sanskrit Dictionary Corpus) you get other instances of the archaic form "jayate" for the pp. verb "ji" unprefixed.  

  

<http://kjc-fs-cluster.kjc.uni-heidelberg.de/dcs/index.php?contents=fundstellen&IDVerbalform=15073>

  

Here is the contents of the page pasted:

  

Liṅgapurāṇa  
LiPur, 1, 85, 125.2  
japena bhogān jayate ca mṛtyuṃ japena siddhiṃ labhate ca muktim //  
Context  
Maṇimāhātmya  
MaṇiMāh, 1, 35.5  
saṃgrāme jayate ripūn bahuvidhān bhogān maṇir yacchati //  
Context  
Mahābhārata  
MBh, 3, 240, 36.1

Context  
Matsyapurāṇa

Context  
MPur, 47, 1.3  
vihārārthaṃ sa deveśo mānuṣeṣviha jayate //  
Context  

  

Hope this should satisfy your querry.

  

These are the other Vedic occurrences of the same form:

  

atha sa jayate punah AV.ii.4.i4;  
aashuM na vaa jayate hinve arvaa # RV.4.7.11d; KS.7.16d  
  
sa sarvaM labhate sa sarvaM jayate # RVKh.10.142.10d (Müller's edition  

  

=====================  

  

In any case, these are generally considered as archaic usages viewed from the Paninan stardard point of view. These may be regular usages according to other non-Panian grammar standards.

  

There is a popular saying that Panini's grammar may not cover the comprehensive range of usages OF Sanskrit Language, but only those words that could be guaged by Paninan standards as Sri Devabodha, the commentator on Mahabharata remarked:  
“Yanyujjahara Mahendrad Vyaso vyakaranarnavat,  
Padratnani kim tani santi paninigoshpade.  
Vyasa took the words from Aindram grammar which was huge like an ocean, are there, those words in Panini grammar which was as small as water collected in the foot mark of a cow’s feet?”  

  

With regards
