\> In this search result (culled out of of Digital Sanskrit Dictionary Corpus) you get other instances of the archaic form "jayate" for the pp. verb "ji" unprefixed.

Thanks much for the information.

\> There is a popular saying that Panini's grammar may not cover the comprehensive range of usages OF Sanskrit Language, but only those words that could be guaged by Paninan standards as Sri Devabodha, the commentator on Mahabharata remarked:  
\> “Yanyujjahara Mahendrad Vyaso vyakaranarnavat,  
\> Padratnani kim tani santi paninigoshpade.  
\> Vyasa took the words from Aindram grammar which was huge like an ocean, are there, those words in Panini grammar which was as small as water collected in the foot mark of a cow’s feet?”

I guess we can also be advised by the saying "इन्द्रादयोऽपि यस्यान्तं न ययुः शब्दवारिधेः, प्रक्रियान्तस्य कृत्स्नस्य क्षमो वक्तुं नरः कथम्?" (source not known to me).
