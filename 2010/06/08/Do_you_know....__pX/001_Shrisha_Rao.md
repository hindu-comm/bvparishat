In this regard, I have always wondered why सत्यमेव जयते is given; should it not be सत्यमेव जयति instead? I believe the latter is also the wording in the अाथर्वणोपनिषत् though some modern publishers give the former, perhaps because they are used to thinking of it as correct. I am also not aware of other classical uses of जयते though जयति is often seen.
