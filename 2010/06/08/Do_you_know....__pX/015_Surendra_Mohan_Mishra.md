**The use of dvandva compound may appreciably bring out the tAtparya of the UGC monogram as pointed out by Dr Panchamukhiji.The maxim 'vyaakhaanato visheshapratipattih' is our guide in doing so.Thus the VishNu PuraaNa statement 'yaa vidyaa saa vimuktaye'receives a further rendering.The Upanishadic saying 'dve vidye veditavye paraa ca aparaa ca,...rigvedo............,atha paraa yayaa tadaksharam adhigamyate' also is found reflected therein.'JNaana' is 'paraa vidyaa' and 'vijNaana' is 'aparaa vidyaa'.to find a corroboration for this in the Amarakosha : 'mokshe dhiir jNaanam anyatra vijnaanam shilpashaastrayoh'.  
  
One more sense appeals to my sense in the modern context that 'jnaana' is 'knowledge' and 'vijnaana' is 'application of the same by observation and experiment' and 'vimuktaye' would mean 'for releasing or unleashing'.Hence a case for shashThii samaasa and then dative.  
Thus the monogram would imply : 'Releasing or Unleashing (the powers of)Knowledge and Application'.ज्ञानं सार्वकालिकं, प्रयोगस्तु समयानुकूलः ।
