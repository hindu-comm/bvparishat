Otto Boetlingk, who translated the A.s.taadhyaayii into German is the 1840's, is said to have written, following Paa.nini's technique, a grammar of the language called Yakut, but I do not know if it adopts the suutra style.

Bak Kun Bae is/was a Korean scholar, not a Western one. His articles on Meghaduuta were published in the periodical Bhaarata-vaa.nii published from Pune in the late 1950's and early 1960's. This periodical is now defunct. However its issues may still be available. Pt. Vasant A. Gadgil should be the most promising source for them.

BK wrote in a style dominated by long compounds as I recall.

The publication details of his second work are as follows:  
Kathāratnākara.  
Dillī Neśanala Pabliśiṃga hāusa \[1970-\]
