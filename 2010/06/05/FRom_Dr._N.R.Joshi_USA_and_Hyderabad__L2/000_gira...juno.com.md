Respected scholars, Namaskar!  
I had honor to meet scholars Dr. Amba Kulkarni and Dr. Sub. Korada on May 31 2010. I am thankful to them for giving me opportunity through seminar to present my views on Sanskrit. It was great opportunity to have interaction with scholars of Univ of Hyderabad.

bvprshat is powerful instrument to bring Sanskrit and Indology scholars from the world on single platform to exhange views.

I attended "All India Oriental Conference" in Tirupati. I presented paper on "Mahabharat-History or Mythology-Sarasvaties outside of Indian subcontinent"

Thanks. to all. I am in USA until the end of June. I am enjoying my visit to India. N.R.Joshi
