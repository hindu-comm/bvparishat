Dear sanskrit-sanskriti-sevaka-friends,

It is a very useful subject and quite challenging to the modern science. The Mahabharata has lot of informations, related to botany, specially about their capacity of perception due to their jnanendriyas. I have dealt with this subject in details in my book " Mahabharata mein vijnan, darshan, aur samaj' , published by Abhishek prakashan, Delhi in 2008. The interested scholars may kindly refer to it.

With due regards,

Rajkumari Trikha
