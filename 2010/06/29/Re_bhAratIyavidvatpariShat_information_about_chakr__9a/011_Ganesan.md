The concept of thirty six tattva-s is definitely older than Kashmir Saivism. We have ample incontrovertible evidences for this.

For, before the rise of Kashmir saivism (which is strictly is a misnomer for the Pratyabhijna system or Trika system) the Saivasiddhanta based on 28 fundamental Agama-s and other Upagama-s was widely prevalentin Kashmir, central India, Lata (southern Gujarat). Some of the Agama-s such as the Matangaparamesvara, te Mrigendra treat this concept in a systematic manner.

The Saivasiddhantaexpounds the 36 tattva-s in a very clear way and we havesome very important philosophical manuals composed by Sadyojyoti, Bhoja and others who livedbetween the7th-9th centuries CE. that describe the concept of 36 tattva-s.

Especially Sadyojyoti, Ramakantha and others lived in Kashmir. Vasugupta the founder of the Trika systemand Abhinavagupta refer toMatangaparamesvara, etc. as well as to Sadyojyoti and others in their texts.

Thus, Saivasiddhanta id the earliest Saiva system which propounds the concept of 36 tattva-s which concept was also followed by the propounders of the Trika-Pratyabhijna school in later period.
