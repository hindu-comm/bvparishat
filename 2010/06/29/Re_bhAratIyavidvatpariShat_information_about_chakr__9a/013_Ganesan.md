There is a longstanding misconception that Saivasiddhanta is a 'southern school'. Not at all. Not at all.

To put the historical development of Saivasiddhanta in a shortest mail:

You will be surprised to know that the earliest available systematic philosophical manuals on Saivasiddhanta doctrines were composed in Kashmir, and, Sadyojyoti is one of the earliest Saiva Acharya-s whose major works have come down to us as I have told in my previous mail.

From the 7th century onwards Saivasiddhanta was prevalent in Kashmir, central India, (King Bhoja was inMalva)then Bengal (Gauda, some of the great Acharya-s hailed from the Radhadesa, ). There are hundreds of inscriptional evidences to substantiate this and they have been fortunately studied. Not only in the Bharatadesa, but also in the south-east asian countries such as Vietnam, Cambodia, Indonesia Saivasiddhanta was wide spread (hundreds of Sanskrit inscriptionswrittenin local scriptsfrom these countries belonging to the period from the6th century onwardshave been edited and published.

Upto the 12th century this was the situation. In 11th-12th centuries it spread in the Kakatiya kingdom of Andhra (again for which we have a long Sanskrit inscription) where we have many names of Saiva Acharya-s pertaining to different lineages and then again further south it spread to Tamil country.

After the 12th century due to Muslim invasion Saivasiddhanta could not survive in the north of Vindhya (as did any other Vedic system) and in the Tamil country where Saiva devotionalism fully based on the Veda and the Purana-swas so wide spread from 5th century which was nourished by the devotoinal outpourings of Nayanmars (Devotees par-excellance of Siva) the Saivasiddhantagot firmly rooted from the 11th century. Of course, it was the greatness of the Tamil country that Saivasiddhanta flourishes there even nowwhere the Saiva Agama-s are still preserved, studied and practised, enriched further by alarge amount of texts, manuals, Tamil adaptations of Agama-s and compositions of original commentaries in Sanskrit as well as in Tamil.

So any discerning scholar will not call Saivasiddhanta a 'southern school' much less would he call the Advaita Vedanta a 'southern school'on the ground that it was systematised by Sankara, a resident of southern Bharat !

With the best wishes,
