My question was whether there are Seven or Six Chakra-s and not the validity or description of the Chakra-s. Is there Seventh one called the Seventh Chakra or is it never called a Chakra?

  

Thanks for the elaborate exposition of the system of Chakra-s alias Adhara-s. (the first of the Chakra-s coincides with Muula+Adhara). The Last one as we know Sahasrara-padma above the Chakra-s and not as a seventh Chakra in so far as I can understand from the explanations. It could be considered as cakra also as it is referred to in Cakraraja-nilaye in Sahasranama. It may be including this, they call Seven Chakra-s the other six being common to both.

  

Please correct me if I am wrong.
