\>It could be considered as cakra also as it is referred to in Cakraraja-nilaye in Sahasranama.  

\>My question was whether there are Seven or Six Chakra-s

  
Chakraraja-nilaya does not mean that. It is the Sri Chakra- (srichahkraraja-nilaya-Srimat-tripurasundari)  
  
As to the question regarding the number of chakras. That there are six adhara-chakras and the seventh is shatchkropari, above/upon the six chakras. What is its name? sahasrara-chakra, meaning that which has 1000 aras. It is special.  
  
Here we have a sort of i) Vedic and 2)Tantra prakriya concord: I) sahasraaksharaa parame vyoman pratishtitaa 2) sahasraaraambujagataa  
  
To answer, YES, there are seven chakras; but the roles are defined as six+one, because of prakiya/functional context.
