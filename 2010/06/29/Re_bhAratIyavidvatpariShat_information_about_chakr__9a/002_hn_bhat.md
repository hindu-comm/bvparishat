Thanks for providing the authentic source.

  

Now what would be the base for describing as Seven Chakra-s as seen in the other web page? May be baseless or some other source not known to us so far or purely depending on the interpretations of the so called modern proponents of Yoga Shastra on the web.

  

Thanks once again.
