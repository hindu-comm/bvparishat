\>I am afraid of wrong information fed in web pages.  
  
Insight is greater than website. Inner-net connectivity is more valid than  
books, commentaries(merely intellectual) and interpretations(outsider).  
  
Now, Sri Bannanje is not merely a scholar; he is guided by intuition(inner tuition).  
I do have personal inner/interactions with him(blessed to have it).  
  
Still if you want to keep the we page confusion(sorry), let it prevail.  
THERE ARE SIX+ONE CHAKRAS. ALL SIX CHAKRAS HAVE THEIR CONTROL SWITCHES IN THE SEVENTH.  
  
Further, if you want to do research in this domain, kindly refer to
