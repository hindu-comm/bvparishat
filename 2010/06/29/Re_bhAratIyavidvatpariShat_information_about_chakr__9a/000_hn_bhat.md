Dear Scholars,

  

A small question. in this thread, some discussion of yoga is going on and I thought I can push my question also. I saw some articles/books on Seven Chakras on many pages on googling. One is here:

  

<http://www.sanatansociety.org/yoga_and_meditation/seven_chakras.htm>

  

[](http://www.sanatansociety.org/yoga_and_meditation/seven_chakras.htm)Are Six Chakra-s are popular in Indian system Muladhara,

svaadhishthaana, Manipuura, Anaahata, Vishuddhi and Aj\~jaa as seen in this page:

  

<http://www.namaste.it/kundalini/kundalini_eng/chakras1.html>

  

Now my question is which one is authentic either six or seven Chakra-s. I am afraid of wrong informations fed in web pages.

  

With regards
