In the *Srimad Bhagavatam* we find the following verse:

*bhutanam chidra-datrtvam bahir antaram eva ca  
pranendriyatma-dhisnyatvam nabhaso vrtti-laksanam*

  

This verse is the potential basis of great scientific research work, for it explains how subtle forms are generated from the ethereal element (nabhah), what their characteristics and actions are, and how the tangible elements, namely air, fire, water and earth, are manifested from the subtle form.

Sankhya does not simply list the basic material elements, but it explains quite scientifically how those elements evolve from the subtlest plane of existence up to the divisions of the universe — this is quite elaborate and scientific indeed.

Yet for science to take full advantage of the Sankhya understanding of matter and to discover how the universe came into being, they will have to do more than just add *kham/nabhas* to their list of elements, they will have to add *ahankara* (ego), *mana* (the mind) and *buddhi* (intelligence) to their table of elements for, indeed, Sankhya lists these as material elements. However, these elements *ahankara, mana* and *buddhi* are categorized as even more subtle than *kham*, because they are closer in character to *atma*, consciousness.

Beyond the gross and subtle material elements being added to the scientific table of elements, Sankhya says that a complete understanding of existence, of reality, is not possible without adding two transcendental, anti-material concepts – namely atma and Paramatma (consciousness and super-consciousness). This, it seems, science struggles with even more than Dark Matter. We have dubbed it ‘Light Matter’.

Most of us know about the Warp Drive from science fiction movies like *Star Trek* and *Contact*, but Moya had the real deal.

In his 1994 physics paper Moya proposed a method of stretching space in a wave that would in theory cause the fabric of space ahead of a spacecraft to contract and the space behind it to expand.

![Warp Drive](https://ci6.googleusercontent.com/proxy/18m8y4lH1jsmHOCkmqgLzijeKktJKqeZb6kMPY8qw090SDbCfrhfI-PW-rfK0q9Met65va6KtfUpMrA2miFjuXO1i4a4vd0dPRkSNxof0BbT_1H2DeOaY6iTaQ=s0-d-e1-ft#http://www.gosai.com/krishna-talk/graphics/modern-science/warp_drive.jpg)The ship would ride this wave inside a region known as a warp bubble of flat space. Since the ship is not moving within this bubble, but carried along as the region itself moves, conventional relativistic effects such as time dilation do not apply in the way they would in the case of a ship moving at high velocity through flat space-time. Also, this method of travel does not actually involve moving faster than light in a local sense, since a light beam within the bubble would still always move faster than the ship; it is only ‘faster than light’ in the sense that, thanks to the contraction of the space in front of it, the ship could reach its destination faster than a light beam restricted to traveling outside the warp bubble. Thus, the Alcubierre drive does not contradict the conventional claim that relativity forbids a slower-than-light object to accelerate to faster-than-light speeds.

Pretty neat stuff – and NASA certainly thought so, mounting their ‘Time Warp’ program at a cost of many millions of dollars for more than a decade before they finally gave it up. “Yes, Time Warp is possible.” they said, “We just can’t do it!” Shucks!

But we are not surprised to find this same theory mentioned many thousands of years ago in the Vedic literature as a *siddhi*, or mystic perfection, by which one can travel to another planet or another galaxy without conventional propulsion and in zero time.

  

One may argue that although this is mentioned in the Vedas, it is doubtful that they were able to do it. That argument could be applied, but first one should realize that they could think about it thousands of years before NASA. Whether they could do it or not is irrelevant. After all, NASA was only thinking about it – they never actually did it either.

See the fun –the Vedic knowledge is easily dismissed or not recognized at all. These are simply stories and myths they say, but theoretical physics/science — now that’s something you can believe in!

It might be fair to ask, “Who writes this stuff?” Have the intelligent people in this world forgotten how to think for themselves? Have we simply become the faithful followers of whatever ‘science’ has to say? Have we lost our reason and logic? Apparently some have!

If we were to list all the scientific discoveries that Vedic civilization has given to the world, some in common use today like the one, the zero, the binary system, calculations regarding astronomical phenomena and more yet to be discovered or understood like the Warp Drive theory, then this article would become a book.
