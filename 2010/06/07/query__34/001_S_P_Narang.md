Dear Dr. Bhagwan Singh Ji, Thanks for the identity of the city of Indra. Indra was a moving warrior and had a number of cities which are to be collected afresh. His conflict with the business community Panis is very well known. These Panis may be earlier Jains who were originally Phonician exercising an impact on Indian culture. Panis are milk/cow-businessmen. In Panjab they are called Bhabada and in gujarat: Sabada which is known even now. Sabara is used for milk in the Rgveda. There is a reference of crossing the sarma ( not a bitch but an investigating lady who explored the secrets of Indra) and reaching the city of Indra. It was the compilation of stories in Brhaddevata: quite late which reversed the story and declared Panis as Asura and established Indra as a deva. Abhiras and Abhirii Prakrit may be attributed to or identified withPanis. Their relation to inhabitants of Afghanistan is to be established afresh which is not done by earlier  
geographers like cunningham and Sircar or Bajpai, K.D. From Afghanistan to Indua, the history is in dark and various phases are to be brought to light on the basis of eatablishing the relationship of the Rv and the other Vedas to the passages of the Brahmanas and the epics may explore a new phase of dark history including cultural. Please try it. I know you from a number of years and as a scholar you can do that. You may take the help of other scholars to collect the historical patches to reconstruct the history. Regards, spnarang
