There is mention of a city of Indra (Indian merchants' colony)on the bank of Vasu - vasordharanam aindra nagaram ... in Gopath Brahman. It appears to refer to Vasukhani or Vasukanni on the bank of a small tributary of Ephratis, which according to the text was surrounded of attacked by the Asuras. Has someone ever checked it and tried to grapple with the problem?
