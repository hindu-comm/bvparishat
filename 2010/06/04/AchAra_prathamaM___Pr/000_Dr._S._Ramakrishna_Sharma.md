हरि: ॐ  
नमस्ते।  
What do the DharmashAstras speak about pet animals?  
To ventilate one's emotions and feelings pets are victimized.  
Pat them when mood is good, kick them when the mood is bad.  
But how this topic is related to this Group? A legitimate question  
indeed!  
Cow is NOT a pet animal, nor is it commercial.Though popularly used  
that way.The value of गोग्रास: against dog-feed is almost forgotten  
where the 'pet dog' shares the family table!  
The photo attached is an example of value fall among the elite.  
सर्वागमानां आचारः:प्रथमं परिकल्पते - this value of values is behind this post.  
प्रणाम:  
  
Without aachAra, of what avail is vidvatvam?
