नमस्ते।  
What follows is taken from a web page on Scientific Blogging. For more, please  
go to the site. <http://www.scientificblogging.com/components_mind/blog/components_mind_according_t_ancient_scriptures_india>  
  
**The components (or faculties) of mind according to  
ancient scriptures are explained with inferences and  
interpretations. Connection of the components with  
states of mind known as dreamless sleep, sleep with  
dreams, wakefulness, trance and para-trance are given.  
Analogy of the working of the components with the parts  
of a computer, and with feedback control systems in  
Electrical Engineering are given. Through analysis, it  
is shown that the spine works like the CPU of a  
computer.**  
Brain is called मस्तिष्कं  
Further, <http://www.hinduwebsite.com/hinduism/concepts/ayurveda.asp>  
""Life (ayu) is the combination (samyoga) of body, senses, mind and reincarnating soul. [Ayurveda](http://www.lifepositive.com/body/ayurveda/ayurveda.asp) is the most sacred science of life, beneficial to humans both in this world and the world beyond." —Charaka Samhita, Sutrasthana, 1.42-43." (Note:mine.There is no mention of brain here, though body is taken in totality)
