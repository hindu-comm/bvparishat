हरि: ॐ  
नमस्ते।  
The following answer was posted to "Foundation for Indian Scientific Heritage" by **Sri Arun Kumar Upadhyay,IPS,M.Sc**  
to a query related to what is sukshma in the context of a discussion on sukshma shariram. Thanks to him. I remember that he has also given extensive annotation with quotations from Vedas/Upanishats on Vishwanatha, Jagannatha and Tribhuvananatha.  
I am searching for that file. As soon as I lay hand on that It will be posted here.

There is a definition and measure of सूक्ष्म in ध्यानबिन्दु उपनिषद -  
वालाग्र शतसाहस्रंतस्य भागस्यभागिनःतस्य भागस्य भागर्धम् तत् क्षये तु निरंजनम् ।   
Man is the firstविश्व. Vishva is defined as closed, connected, conscious system (श्वेताश्वतर उपनिषद5/9etc ). Next smaller vishva is balagra =hair end, i.e. a cell which is approximately 100 thosands part of our own size. This is world for Biology (cytology). Since that is limit of resolution of human eye, 100 thosand is called Laksha = to see. Next smaller vishva is atom which is again 100 thousands part smaller-that is world for quantum mechanics or chemistry. Creation from atoms and their size is defined in श्वेताश्वतर उपनिषद5/9-  
वालाग्र शतभागस्य शतधा कल्पितस्यच। भागोजीवः स विज्ञेयः सामृतत्वाय कल्पते ।   
= Imagine 100 parts of the 100 parts of hair end (i.e. 10,000 parts of hair end of micron size, million parts of a centimeter). That is size of atom (Jiva) which is not destryed in any creation. Vaisheshika philosophy tells thatnothing is new creation, all is recombination of atoms. That is precisely told in chemistry that atom of angstrom size (10000 parts of micron) is not destroyed in any chemical reaction.  
Next smaller world is nucleus, again smaller by 100 thosands-that is world for nuclear physics. Sizes smaller than that are not defined, as they are smaller than the measuring scale which is wavelength of light-matter particles themselves have dual nature and their wavelength varies with energy. But 4 more levels, successively smaller by 100 thosands are described here. They are-(1) Jagat=moving particles of 3 types-Chara = Lepton, Sthanu =baryon, and Anu-Purvashah =mesonic link particles. (2) Deva-danava-Devas are 33, danavas are 99. Creation is from Devas only, so created World is only one fourth of Purusha (Purusha sukta, 3,4). (3) Pitara-Prototypes, (4) Rishi=rassi in Hindi=string. Its size is 10 power minus 35. This is called Planck's length in modern Physics and is basis of all the string theories and is size of primordial strings. These 4 are named as per Manusmriti (3/201)-  
ऋषिभ्यः पितरो जाताः पितृभ्यो देवदानवाः। देवेभ्यश्चजगत् सर्वंचरं स्थाण्वनुपूर्वशः।   
Any size smaller than Rishi has been defined as Niranjana = i.e. it can not be seen with any instrument or understood by any logic**-Arun**
