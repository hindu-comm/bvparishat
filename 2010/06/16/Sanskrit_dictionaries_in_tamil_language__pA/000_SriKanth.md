Hi,  
  
I am curious to know if there are any dictionaries from Sanskrit ->  
Tamil language. If there is any please let me know how to get it. I am  
a beginner - learner of Sanskrit. I have Apte's both dictionaries  
(practical and students) and I am wondering if there is any dictionary  
in tamil (my mother tongue).  
  
Srikanth.
