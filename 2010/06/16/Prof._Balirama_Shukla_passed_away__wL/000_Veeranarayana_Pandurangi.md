it is heard that Prof. Balirama Shukla formerly professor of philosophy in pune uni passed away during the AIOC tirupati. it is really a sad news for all the members of bvp. he was a very good scholar traditionally trained naiyayika and philosopher. his untimely death (he was 69) is mourned

अथ चेत्त्वमिमं धर्म्यं संग्रामं न करिष्यसि। ततः स्वधर्मं कीर्तिं च हित्वा पापमवाप्स्यसि।। तस्मादुत्तिष्ठ कौन्तेय युद्धाय कृतनिश्चयः। निराशीर्निर्ममो भूत्वा युध्यस्व विगतज्वरः।। (भ.गी.)
