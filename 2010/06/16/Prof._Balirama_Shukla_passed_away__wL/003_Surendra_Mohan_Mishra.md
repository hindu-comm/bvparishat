**Professor Baliram Shukla belonged to the tradition of sastric learning.I remember having met him in the Yuktidiipikaa seminar at Haridwar and at ICPR and Pune.His work on the problem of inference in Indian Logic and other works showed his sastric acumen and deep-rooted scholarship.One wishes such scholars to live a longer life to serve Sarasvatii but God has his own way.Let's pray for the veteran scholar lasting peace and divine bliss.
