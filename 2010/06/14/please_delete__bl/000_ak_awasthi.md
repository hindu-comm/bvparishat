 Dear Mr Bhatt,  

I am sending u this mail to ask u for help. I am not a member of Bhartiya vidyat parishad but I keep receiving mails which are so many that I have to take so much time to delete them. It is an unneccesary waste of my time. I work full time andit is sometimes a nuisance for me receiving as many as 10-15 mails from the members. Can u pls get my name deleted from the list. I will be extremely thankful to you.
