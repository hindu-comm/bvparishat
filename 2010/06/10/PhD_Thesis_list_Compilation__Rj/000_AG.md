Namaamsi  
  
I was wondering, whether the esteemed faculty, holding membership of  
this forum, could compile the list of Thesis papers, Submitted by PhD  
aspirants in various Universities in your knowledge.  
  
Name of the Thesis, Department of Samskruta (Indology), Submitted by,  
Name of the University, State, Year of Submission, Name of the Guide  
(Synopsis if Available).  
  
This sort of compilation would be handy for new researchers or any of  
us, to refer to any matter of interest and possibly contact the  
person.  
  
The moderators may kindly make the provision for this, my designing a  
Google Form (On Google Documents) for this. I can also design that, if  
required.
