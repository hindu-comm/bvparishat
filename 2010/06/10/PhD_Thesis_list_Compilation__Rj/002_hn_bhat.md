Mr. Jagannath is right that the information is available on some website. I also remember having seen in a site a list of Ph.D Thesises submitted in different subjects in different Universities. I don't remember the site and it may not be regularly updated.  

  

If the members of this try update information may be made available by the moderators compiling a list and updating it with details of year of award and publication also. It may be useful for the fresh researchers while selecting the topic. But it will take time and lot of work to compile such a list. Or a list generated automatically as the members furnish the details with updates from their Universities/Departments.

  

With regards
