**Rightly is it put by Prof. S P Narangji that the Praacii-Jyoti : Digest of Indological Studies published by institute of Sanskrit and Indological Studies of Kurukshetra University publishes an annual progressive list of theses titles both registered and awarded along with the non-critical abstracts of research articles culled from research journals in Indology published in various languages.The editor of the journal could be helped and guided by the scholars by sending the list of PhD/Dlitt theses titles etc being registered/awarded year to year for publication and global circulation.Regards.SMM**
