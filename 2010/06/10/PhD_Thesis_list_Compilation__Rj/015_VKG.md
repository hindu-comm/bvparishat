Dear Girishji!  
  
This is the model, I am looking for. In addition, this should have the  
branch of the PhD thesis, rather than the name of the Thesis Paper, as  
provided in the Rashtreeya Sanskrit Sansthan Site.  
  
Scholars can start work on it. It should be on web2 model, to  
authorise empanelled Scholars/ Professors to list the Thesis. This  
compendium should also be searchable by Google too. (This means,  
parametres should be set to suit its system)>  
  
It should also have Samskruta Version, as well as Englishi.  
  
Scholars may consider this proposal.  
Pranaams  
Vamshi
