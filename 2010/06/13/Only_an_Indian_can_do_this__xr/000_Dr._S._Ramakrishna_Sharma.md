"Prahlad Jani, also known as Mataji, has surprised the doctors across the globe as he has managed   
to survive for 65 years without any food or water and has not urine or stool during the whole period.  
The reports of medical tests which are being conducted on Mataji since April 22 are normal. The tests included cardiac,  
MRI of chest, abdomen and spine, EEG." **
