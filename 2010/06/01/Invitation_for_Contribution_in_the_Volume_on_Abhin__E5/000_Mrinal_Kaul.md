(This is the English translation of the original Sanskrit circular. This circular was originally issued some months back. We are reproducing it here for a broader circulation amongst Indologists).

  

Dear Friends,

  

It would not be an exaggeration to claim that a host of Kashmirian philosophers, rhetoricians, Buddhist scholars, Tantra experts, poets, logicians and grammarians have carved out a niche for themselves in the Sanskrit Literature and Abhinavagupta towers them all and this premise is also supported by Madhurājayogin in the following verse of his *Gurunāthaparāmarśa* -

  

“abhinavaguptanāthalikhitaṃ likhitaṃ hṛdaye / taditaraśāstrakāralikhitaṃ likhitaṃ salile //”

  

All of us are well aware of the fact that the tradition of Sanskrit learning in Kashmir is now just a matter of books and even those native Sanskrit scholars who testified the maxim ‘even a castor-oil plant is considered a tree in the desert’ are no more. The deplorable condition of the intelligentsia of Kashmirian Śaiva schools (in contemporary Kashmir) is much better when less commented. On December 18, 2008 we lost another such luminary named **Pandit Nilkanth Gurtu** who was perhaps the last traditional expert in Śaiva of Kashmir. To honour his memory we propose to bring out a volume titled “**Ācārya Abhinavagupta**” in Sanskrit language.

  

Thus proceeds my humble plead to the scholars to contribute to our volume with an original, intensive, well researched and highly critical essay on Abhinavagupta. The contributors are free to express their critical and original ideas regarding the different works of varied genres which reflect the variegated facets of Abhinavagupta as that of a philosopher, a rhetorician, a critic, or a write of hymns.

  

A Brief Life Sketch of Prof Nilkanth Gurtu

  

Professor Nilkanth Gurtu was born on January 2, 1925 in Srinagar (Kashmir) and was a son of Pandit Tarachand Gurtu. He was initiated into Sanskrit studies by Pandit Maheshwar Nath Nehru. Pandit Jankinath Dhar (Vanaprastha) of Arya Samaj taught him the Aṣṭādhyāyī. Later, he learned advanced texts of Sanskrit grammar and linguistics with Pandit Lalkak Langoo and Pandit Sarvadananda Handoo of Dharmarth Council taught him several texts of Sanskrit literature. He also qualified the traditional degrees of Prājña, Viśārada and Śāstrī in Sanskrit from Government Sanskrit College in Srinagar that was affiliated to the undivided University of Punjab in Lahore. After qualifying for Prabhākar degree he went ahead and earned a B.A. in Sanskrit. This allowed him to have a solid foundation and develop deep groundings in Sanskrit language and literature.

  

Professor Gurtu initially worked in Government High School of Tral village in Kashmir as a Sanskrit teacher. While teaching there he also earned an M.A. in Sanskrit. Thereafter, in 1955 he was appointed as the Head-pandit in the Jammu & Kashmir Research and Publication Department of Government of Jammu & Kashmir. Later, while teaching in the Government Souer College in his capacity as a lecturer of Sanskrit, he also obtained a degree of M.A. in Hindi. Since 1958 till the time of his retirement he taught in Amar Singh College under the University of Kashmir in Srinagar (Kashmir).

  

Professor Nilkanth Gurtu also prepared several editions and translations of many difficult texts belonging to Kashmirian Trika domain of Śaivism. Many of his works remained unpublished because of want of resources. The most remarkable work done by him was the compilation of the Kāśmīra-śaiva-darśana-bṛhat-koṣa that was published in two volumes from the Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan in Jammu. This book will survive as a monumental reference work on the Śaiva schools of Kashmir.

  

Prof Gurtu was not only confined to teaching in academic institutions, but he covered that extra mile and went ahead to learn about the Kashmirian Saiva schools from his teachers like Professor Balajinnath Pandit and Swami Lakshman Joo. He learnt some texts of Kashmirian Trika and Spanda schools with the well known savant Lakshman Joo during the sixties, seventies and eighties of the last century. In his famous Sunday classes Lakshman Joo several times used to offer Prof Gurtu to teach his students the various Sanskrit texts. Besides learning many other texts with him, he also studied the Parātriśikāvivaraṇa with him from 1981-82 that he later translated into Hindi while Jaidev Singh translated it into English.

  

Professor Gurtu was not only an original Śaiva thinker, but also a pioneering critic and a prolific writer with a deep insight into the subject of his choice. His writings are a testimony to this fact. He also had a deep understanding of several other important schools of Indian philosophy. In his works, he clearly reflects his knowledge of major Kashmirian schools of Buddhism and Śaiva dualists. His mind was pregnant with remarkable understanding of Vedānta, Sāṁkhya and Yoga schools. He had very passionately studied the theories of Indian aestheticians and rhetoricians. Even though he mainly dealt with Abhinavagupta throughout his life, but with his matchless knowledge of diverse schools of Indian thought he was always trying to look for Abhinavagupta’s fitting place in the broader domain of Indian philosophy. What made him distinct was his right understanding of the Tantric systems of Kashmir and their place in the socio-political milieu of early medieval Kashmir. He indeed was a man of distinct academic calibre and authentic achievements.

  

General Guidelines for Contributors:

  

1.  The formal deadline for submission is decided to be 31
    December 2010. But we are ready to offer any contributor ample time
    as far as the contribution is a highly critical andoriginal
    research article. The articles should certainly be unpublished. 2.  There are no hard and fast rules about the length of contributions.
    We will not mind a hard core critically researched paper of any
    length. We are just concerned about originality and quality. 3.  The article can be neatly hand-written or typed with double space on
    one side of the A-4 sheet. 4.  Please attach your most recent Resume with the article. 5.  It would be helpful if you could inform the editors in prior about
    the chosen topic and the approximate length of your article to avoid
    overlapping of topics and other related editorial hassles. 6.  If some contributors are unable to contribute in Sanskrit language
    but are willing to submit in English or Kashmiri, then we should try
    getting their articles translated into Sanskrit by our team.
