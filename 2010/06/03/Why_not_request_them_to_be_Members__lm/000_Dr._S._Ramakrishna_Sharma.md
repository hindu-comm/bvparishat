"It is not Mr. Vijayakumar that has been appointed as the new VC for the  
Karnatak Sanskrit University. It is Sri. Mallepuram Venkatesh.  
Many persons have wrongly read and undrstood it and have eventually congratulated.

हरि: ॐ  
नमस्ते।  
  
Dear All,  
Sanskrit University, Karnataka is not named, to my knowledge, "Karnatak Sanaskrit University".  
And while a lot of space is used to post "congratulations", it is practical to think whether it is  
read by those to whom it is addressed. In other words, are they members of "Bharatiya Vidvat Parishat"?  
If not, why not someone who is in contact with them invite them to join this Group?  
प्रणाम:
