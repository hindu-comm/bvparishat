I would like to append some more items to the list  
  
7) Do not "top post" (Most important )  
To know about top posting refer <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posting_style#Top-posting>  
8) Do not copy past HTML contents as such and do not send message in HTML format  
9) Avoid disclaimers in your signature  
10) Refer archives before posting a question (Make sure that your question is not answered previously, before asking the question )  
11) Use Unicode Input method and font to enter text in Devanagari
