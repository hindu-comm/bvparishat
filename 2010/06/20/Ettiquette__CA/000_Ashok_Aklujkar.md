Actually a code of conduct already exists for Internet discussion lists. I reproduce the one I have in my notes. It is short enough to be reproduced periodically as a reminder. New subscribers should get it automatically as soon as they are admitted.

  

**Nettiquette:**

1\. Post when you have a question; can answer a question posed on the

list; or can clarify, expand, challenge, or forward the argument.

2. Quote only directly relevant portions of previous posts in your

contribution.

3. Send scholarly posts, not polemical or pious ones.

4. Engage in scholarly debate, not personal attacks.

5. Use the subject line to indicate the subject of your post. Change

subject lines when you are changing the direction of the conversation.

6. Put your real-life name at the end of your message.

  

In view of my experience of the last few months, I would urge the members of this list to pay particular attention to point 2.

  

If the relevant part from an earlier post is quoted first, it creates the necessary context and helps the reader in understanding the new post as well as in deciding if he/she should read it in full.

  

It is understandable that some wish to express their debt to a scholar who leaves this world or to congratulate someone who is promoted. Posts in such circumstances should, however, be worded in such a way that they rise above the merely personal detail and become useful to at least some members of the scholarly community. How about honouring the person concerned or the memory of the person concerned by giving a bibliography of his or her writings and a short list of major contributions to the field?

  

Experience elsewhere indicates that those members who have more time on their hands (for reasons such as retirement, etc.) tend to think that they should contribute a post to the list almost every day. It helps if such members pay particular attention to point 1.
