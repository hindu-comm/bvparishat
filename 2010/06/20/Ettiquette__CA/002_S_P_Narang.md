It is advisable for all the members particularly new and young that they should try to learn something and not try to become the Acaryas the next day. New ideas, historical perspectives not known in the old books of history, new facts which are explored by theIntermet which has reduced the boundaries of the globe and more the etiquettes befitting the objectives of parisad must be followed. Vinaya should be the ideal applicable to all. I fully endorse the ideas of Prof. Aklujkar. Regards, spnarang
