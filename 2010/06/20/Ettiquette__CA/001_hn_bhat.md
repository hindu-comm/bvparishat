Dear all,

  

It is highly desirable that the conventions are strictly followed by the members without waiting for the managers to implement them.

  

Some lists have softwares included to truncate the message beyond a limit of quoted message or characters a reply can take with it.

  

It is a pity that even the rules for posting were were reproduced by Prof. Aklujkar, it is immediately ignored by members while posting. I was attracted by the subject line in another thread on derivation of names, but I found in it many other things preceding which took me a little more time to find the actual reply passing through many irrelevant discussions from the past quoted messages.

  

I call immediate attention of all the members, especially the newbies to the useful suggestions made by Prof.Aklujkar.

  

With regards
