namah sabhAyai,  
 I am conducting a workshop on Epistemology in Indian Philosophies and wanted to collect all possible information regarding the subject. I request the learned in this Parishat to let me know about standard reference books on Epistemology in English according to Nyaya, Mimamsa and Vedanta (Advaita,Vishishtadvaita,Dvaita) schools that I can recommend to my students. Also a list of original Sanskrit works for reference would be greatly appreciated.  
  
Thanking You,  
  
regards,
