Thanks for all scholars who gave valuable inputs. Where can I get the book **CONCEPTS OF KNOWLEDGE East and West?**  
Is it available online? Can any one of the scholars help me in procuring some of the books/research journals mentioned by Shri Varkhediji and
also those mentioned by Shri Rani ji ? Pl. help  
  
With best regards,
