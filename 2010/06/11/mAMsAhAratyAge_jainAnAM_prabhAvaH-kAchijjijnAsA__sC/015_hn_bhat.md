It is very simple question. The three avatara-s eaten by Maithila-s are Matsya, Kurma and Varaha. Hence Vishnu took the 4th avatara, which they cannot eat. Because Lion and Man are not eaten as food generally. This seems to be the purport of the shloka quoted.

  

It is in order:

  

मत्स्यः कूर्मो वराहश्च नारसिंहो ऽथ वामनः।

*रामो रामश्च*कृष्णश्च*बुद्धः*कल्की चते*दश\|\|*

  

Hope this will make sense in the context of the shloka.

  

**With regards**
