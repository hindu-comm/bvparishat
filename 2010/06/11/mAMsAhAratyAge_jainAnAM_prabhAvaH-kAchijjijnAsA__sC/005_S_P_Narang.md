May not be acceptable to vegetarians and non-violent community like myself, it is a reality that meat was eaten as a food and a medicine. A few detailsin DN Jha's work which may be controversial. Vegetarianism moved from non-vegetarianism due to dayaa and karunaa which was acceptable to Bauddhas and Jains including a number of Indian religious faiths. Regards, spnarang
