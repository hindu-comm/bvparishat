**Esteemed Scholars,**

**Just I add a little to the ongoing discussion on the 10 incarnations of Shri Vishnu.Jayadeva in his Giitagovinda speaks of 10 incarnations of ShriKrishna as ShriiVishnu.Thus Krishna is not an avataara but is the avataarin.Cf. the verse at the beginning of the work 'vedaanuddharate--------halam kalayate----------dashaakritikrite krishnaaya tubhyam namah'.Thus Balaraama is one of the 10 and not a partial avataara.There are of course different accounts and justifications.**

**One peculiar phenomenon we find on the walls of the Shrii Jagannaatha temple at Puri that in the sequence of the 10 incarnations in a line there is Jagannatha in place of Buddha.**

**As per our conceptualisation of an avataara the last two verses of the Giitaa ch.10 are worth contemplating.**
