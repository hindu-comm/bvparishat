\> Dear friends: I feel the verse means that the Lord assumed the Narasimha form apprehending that the Maithilas may swallow even the remaining Avatraras of His. I think there is no need to bring in Adisesha here since he is not there in the list of Avataras, except as a partial manifestation as Balarama, when the Lord manifested as Krishna.

There is actually a controversy re the interpretation of that Mahābhārata verse listing the ten incarnations; in much of North India and in the tradition of Madhva, the first राम refers to भार्गव राम, i.e., परशुराम, and the second to the well-known दाशरथ राम. In some South Indian traditions (e.g., that of Rāmānuja), the first राम is the दाशरथ राम whilst the second is the यादव राम, i.e., बलराम. These traditions do not recognize परशुराम as a full incarnation of Viṣṇu.
