I had not heard the verse before. It is a mischievously charming example of how much a good Skt author can pack in the 32 syllables of an anu.s.tubh. If the author's name is known, it should be conveyed (or was the sender of the verse himself/herself the author?). In the discussion so far, the third quarter has not been taken into account. I took the verse as meaning: The Maithilas ate the first three incarnations of [Vi.s.nu](http://Vi.s.nu): Matsya, Kuurma and Varaaha. [Vi.s.nu](http://Vi.s.nu) became apprehensive that they would next eat his serpent, the ;Se.sa. So, in order to ward them off, he took the frightening Man-lion form.
