Dear friends: I feel the verse means that the Lord assumed the Narasimha form apprehending that the Maithilas may swallow even the remaining Avatraras of His. I think there is no need to bring in Adisesha here since he is not there in the list of Avataras, except as a partial manifestation as Balarama, when the Lord manifested as Krishna.
