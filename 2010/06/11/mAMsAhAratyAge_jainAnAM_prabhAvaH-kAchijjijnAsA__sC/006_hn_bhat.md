Dear Sirs,

Here is a link to a paper **IN INDIAN AND OTHER RELIGIONS  
A HISTORICAL SURVEY**  
J. N. Mankar  
Submitted to 14th World Vegetarian Congress, Paris

  

<http://www.ivu.org/congress/wvc57/souvenir/mankar2.html>

  

[](http://www.ivu.org/congress/wvc57/souvenir/mankar2.html)Hope this would shed some more light on the discussion. The injunction "maa himsyaa sarvaa bhuutaani" is oft. quoted. Here is another similar discussion in a forum:

  

<http://translate.google.co.in/translate?hl=en&sl=nl&u=http://forum.sangam.nl/het-hindoeisme/1-pandit-attry-2-a-2.html&ei=lJgZTKLuKovQccq2iaYM&sa=X&oi=translate&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CCIQ7gEwAQ&prev=/search%3Fq%3DMahinsyat%2BSarva%2BBhutani%26hl%3Den>

  

It had been accepted generaly and in later times, vaidikii himsaa is not considered as himsaa. But all others are considered as himsaa. This discussion occurs in Bhashaparicheda of Nyayapanchanana Vishvanathacharya casually (if my memory is right) and also may be found in earlier texts on Mimamsa also.

  

The above paper was published in the following website at 15th Vegetarian Congress in 1957 held in India.

With regards
