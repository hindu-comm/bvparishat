The discussion has turned in another direction. I have also something to add. In the other reading of the third "paada" i.e.

  

रामो रामश्च रामश्च

  

whether it is कृष्ण or बुद्ध considered among them to complete the number ten. Both could not be included simultaneously as it would be amount to 11 avatara-s, of the 24 avatara-s. But in the list of enumeration of ten, only one can be included. Inclusion of Buddha is attested by Kshemendra in his Dasavataracarita along with Krishna. In the above Matsyapurana reading also Krishna is considered as one of the avatara-s to complete the number ten. If Balarama is to be included in the list of ten, either Krishna or Buddha will have to be eliminated. So my question is in this reading of the 3rd "paada" whether the 4th should read as:

  

बुद्धः कल्कीति ते दश or कृष्णः कल्कीति ते दश।

  

If Krishna is to be eliminated from the list, he is to be considered as the पूर्णावतार and the list of the ten should be considered as listing his partial incarnation. Otherwise, Krishna is to be retained, the well attested avatara of बुद्ध has to be eliminated. Any satisfactory solution to this puzzle? In any case, there are certainly two Rama-s included. One will be Rama, the son of Dasaratha and the other son of Jamadagni. The third one included would be Balarama.

  

On Prof. Narasimhacharya-s remark, I have only to say that both meanings for शेष can be entertained in turn. When Avataratraya rests in denoting the three incarnations only, then it would mean as interpreted by him meaning the rest of his incarnations. But when "avataratraya" does not necessarily rest in conveying the trio of incarnation, as any avatara- by itself could not be eaten by men and further extended to Fish, tortoise and pig in general, then शेष can be taken to mean the serpent, also, giving rise to the interpretation given by Prom. Aklujkar.

  

In any case, thanks are due to the member who bounced this beautiful verse while a discussion is going on vegetarian or non-vegetarian food.
