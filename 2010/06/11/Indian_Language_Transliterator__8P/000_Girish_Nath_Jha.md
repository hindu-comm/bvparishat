Please test this alpha version that i have just brought out at <http://sanskrit.jnu.ac.in/ile>  
it converts unicode text between 9 Indian languages. In addition, you can convert Indian language text into Romanized form as well.

This is just an alpha version, your feedback can be useful in making the software stable

warm regards
