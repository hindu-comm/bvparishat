Dharma was Themis and discipline in all the fields of life irrespective of any caste or religious status. It is painful we have forgotton it and have spoiled the image of Dharma with our own pravaada. It is not the fault of Dharma but that of an individual. Naisa sthaNoraparaadhaH yadenamandhaH na pas'yati. Let us restore our norms of anus'aasana, dayaa, tuSTi, karuNaa etc. which had been essential ingredients of dharma. It is a prayer to all and God. Regards, spnarang
