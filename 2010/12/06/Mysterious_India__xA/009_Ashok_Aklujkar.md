As I see it, Dr. Joshi has used the term/phrase 'saarvajanika [mok.sa](http://mok.sa)' in a laak.sa.nika (metaphorical,figurative, secondary) sense. To raise philosophical points against the notion in the term will not be fair (apart from the fact that the ancient Indian tradition was aware of these points and hence wisely ruled out anything like the Day of Judgment on which every devout person is redeemed).

  

I have been amused as well as disturbed by the discussion his well-intentioned post has generated. I am sure hundreds of us have met hundreds of people who, in different words, have complained about lack of queuing, lack of \*social/community-scale\* hygiene etc. in modern India (the causes of this phenomenon would be another issue which need not be discussed on this list). What is so wrong if someone suggests that our holy men, who usually have a special relationship with Sanskrit, should be addressing that situation? Do we not have so much freedom on this list? Does everyone have to be a believer here? (No responses to this, please. Just think about the question. I am sure the readers of this post know the answer.)

  

One proper response to Dr. Joshi's post would be to list the holy men who are trying to improve the social behaviour and thereby to contribute to creating a more precise picture of the activities of our holy men. This would be more in keeping with the aim of this list to create collective wisdom. Another proper response would be to question Dr. Joshi's very assumption and make a case for why the sort of work he expects of the holy men should not be expected of them.

  

(By the way, I do not agree with all views or possibilities Dr. Joshi has expressed on this list, and I suspect that he knows that. But for want of time I will not engage in discussing those views or issues, now or in the near future.)

  

To enable you to check if I am interpreting Dr. Joshi's original post correctly, I reproduce it below in its entirety, against my normal practice and the usual Internet etiquette. Please read it by keeping in mind the excellent rules the Miimaa.msaa developed for textual interpretation. Kindly avoid pouncing on this or that word out of its overall context. Avoid attribution of motives for which there is no support in the words actually used by Dr. Joshi (such avoidance is another great achievement of theMiimaa.msaa, and one of the reasons for its starting with an authorless Veda; if there is no author, there can be no motives, no charges of vai.samya or nairgh.r.nya).
