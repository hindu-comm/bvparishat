Respected Scholars, Namaste!



Mysterious India



Why to blame foreigners to create Mysterious impression of India?

Every Hindu religious organization ( I do not like to name them here) in continuously teach about attaining personal individual Moksha or salvation. That too by the same old ways.



Did you find any Saadhu teaching people ' When you stand in the line on the bus station or railway station, all will get tickets happily and that is Saarvajanika Moksha. When you do not throw trash on the street, and do not eat in the next door Bhel-Misal shop, that is Saarvajanika Moksha. When you follow traffic lights while driving, that is Saarvajanika Mokha, no body gets killed. Does any Saadhu tell political leaders do not put your ugly dirty posters with big Hindu red tilak on foreheads covering traffic lights on streets. Does any Saadhu teach that flies on the railway stations and bus stations can be controlled by using chemicals.When flies are controlled that is Saarvajanika Moksha.



On this scholarly list of BVparishata how many times we hear that our ancient scriptures including treatises on grammar are revealed texts direct connection from that GOD. Is not that mysterious India?



Ancient Hindu kings used to perform Yajnyas so that they can attain Heaven of Indra. There is always eyes towards the sky, the mysterious, the unknown, the apourusheya Vedas directly revealed to Drashtra sages, our sages, some of them sitting crosslegged in cold cold Himalayas (like every Sadhu coming to Houston claims coming from Himalayaya.)



Was there ever teaching that we can create Heaven in India so that we will all enjoy it together-Saarvajanika? No I want my ticket on the railway station first by pushing others aside.That is my Moksha as taught by all Saadhus of India. In my opinion looking at the rise of corruption cases in India, I came to conclusion that modern Indian people are not afraid of Hindu gods or god-realized saints. They say this was going on from thousands of years. Who cares? I feel a new way of teaching Hindu religionmust be promoted--"There is no individual Moksha.There exists only Saarvajanika Mokha." Thanks. I am sorry. N.R.Joshi
