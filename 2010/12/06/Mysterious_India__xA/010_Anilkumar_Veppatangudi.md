This raises a fundamental question about Hinduism. Hinduism has always been a religion of the individual and not doctrinaire unlike the religions of the book which lay down the law and forbid any questioning or debate, A Hindu is supposed to seek Moksha for himself albeit he is advised to seek a Guru for guidance. Therefore, the question of Sarvajanika Moksha is a no brainer. Also,Moksha is a spritiual and religious pursuit and has nothing to do with civic sense or social responsibility. A sadhu is sought to guide one in understanding the ultimate and NOTfor lessons in group behaviour. If everyone acquired and practised the Astha Gunas of Daya, Shanti, An-asuya, Mangalam, Anaayaasa,Shoucha, Akaarpanya and Aspruha, the world would be a better place-Anil Kumar.
