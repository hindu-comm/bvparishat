Thank you,  
Sri Bhagavan Singh Ji,

  
  
\>I wish you could be sensible and  
answer the points raised by Mr Joshi sensibly.  
That could be a more promising opening.  
  

That makes more sense than the outpouring of Mr Joshi.  
Is it not too obviously known to all, all that is stated vociferously in the post  
of Mr Joshi? This not first time he lashes on like this.

  
  
"On this scholarly list of BVparishata how many times we hear that our ancient scriptures including treatises on grammar are revealed texts direct connection from that GOD. Is not that mysterious India?"  
  

Does it make any sense? Which GOD he is referring to? Is he mocking at the scholarly?  
"वेदा शास्त्राणि विज्ञानं एतत् सर्वं जनार्दनात्"  
There are hundreds of statements as above. But for whom?  
\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*  
"यो वेदादौ स्वर: प्रोक्तो वेदान्ते च प्रतिष्ठित:।  
तस्य प्रकृतिलीनस्य य पर: स महेश्वर: ।।"  
If one has the required spiritual refinement to comprehend the meaning  
in experience of the mantra mentioned above, without Dictionary, then  
there is sense, sensitivity and sensibility.  
\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*  
प्रज्ञावादांश्च भाषसे! What else?!  
क्षन्तव्य:\|
