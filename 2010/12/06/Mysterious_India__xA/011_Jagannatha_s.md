Respected scholars,



 I think, lack of civic sense of Indiansis criticised by Dr. Joshi. His \`\`सार्वजनिकमोक्ष'' has nothing to do with preaching the scriptures. But one thing is certain. If the \`\`spiritual gurus'' of our country( apart from their discourses on spirituality)advise the people not to neglect civic duties (like not throwing litter according to their well and wish), it will have great impact on the society. Practice regarding spirituality does not mean civiccarelessness. This is the summary of the posting of Dr. Joshi, I guess. If it is so, he is 100% correct. Because, barringa few exceptions,we, the Indians do lack civic sense. If I remember correctly, there is a portion in
Varahapurana which lists some offences of carelessness of devotees ( performing worship without taking bath etc). I think to some extentthe purport of the same related tocivic sense.I request the scholars to correct me if I am wrong.
