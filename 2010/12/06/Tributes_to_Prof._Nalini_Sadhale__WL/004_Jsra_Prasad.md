Really difficult to digest that Prof. Nalini Sadhale is not with us.  
Our department had the privilege to have her in our BoS for two years (2006-08). So patiently she came from Aurangabad and enriched the discussions in establishing our departmental objectives and further courses. We deeply mourn her demise. तासामात्मनः शान्तिर्भवतु ।  
  
Sincerely,  
Prasad
