I agree with Ganeshanaji and Prof Dipak Bhattacharya. Mass scale  
forgery and dropping of crucial parts of texts by Britishers for their  
forged history has created a problem in their understanding. Aryabhata  
date was changed from 360 kali to 3600 kali when none of the  
calculation fits the data. In all puranas dates of kali kings have  
been forged-e.g. Parikshita to Nanda has been changed from 1500 to  
1050 years. But this does not fit with total years of each kingdom and  
saptarshi eras given at end. Pargiter and Jones had not seen Kaliyuga  
raja vrittanta and did not understand saptarshi era, so these escaped  
their destruction. After Narayana Shastri quoted them and original  
matsya purana before destruction, his copies were destroyed. Buhler  
also after quoting Saptarshi era from Rajatarangini removed the  
original verse and shifted date of mahabharata by 690 years.  
Devanagari script was standardised about 600 years ago when Sayana  
wrote his commentary-there was no other Hindu kingdom to do this.-
