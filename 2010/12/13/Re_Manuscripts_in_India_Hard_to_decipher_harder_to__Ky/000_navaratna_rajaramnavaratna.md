 My hard earned experience is the hardest task is selection. To call a spade a spade, most manuscripts contain almost nothing of value. A large number of them are on astrology, fortune telling and the like.



 Before printing became widespread, manuscript production was a major activity. So you find many repetitions of well-known works written in different scripts with wide variation. Devanagari didn't become the standard for Sanskrit until well into the 19th century.



 Since the supply of manuscript specialists (epigraphists and paleographers) is very limited, some method should be used for classifying manuscripts based on their importance. Otherwise important works will be drowned by the flood of trivia.
