 Please don't twist statements. The question is not whether competent scholars don't spend enough time on this or that.... The real problem is that competent scholars are scarce and how best to use their talents. Treat it as a technical and administrative problem.



 The problem is a difficult one at best, let us not get diverted by airing personal grievances. Whether I have heard or not Pippalada Samhita (I have) doesn't make the availability of scholars any less important.
