\<\<To call a spade a spade, most manuscripts contain almost nothing of value. A large number of them are on astrology, fortune telling and the like.>\>



As a researcher working with the manuscripts formore than25 years I totally disagree with the above statement.

In fact I would say that many of valuable texts are still in the manuscripts to be deciphered, edited and published. This is more so in the domain of Agamas, Tantras and the related texts which are so vast,Medicine (Siddha, Ayurveda ...), Legends relating to a particular holy site (Sthalamahatmya or Sthalapurana) and the Puranas. The manuscripts in these subjects includethose in Sanskrit and in the regional languages.

The more we find copies of a particular textit showsits popularity among scholars as well as common readersin earlier times.

And, leaving the Sastras--Nyaya, Vedanta, Mimamsa, etc., manytexts of Agamas, Ritual manuals, Sthalapuranas have been rendered into the vernaculars since long which is the strongest proof of their being the most read texts of the common pepole.

Many Manuscript libraries and private owners still possess such valuable manuscripts which are yet to be fully catalogued in a descriptive way and published.

Added to this, there is the dearth of young scholars nowadays coming forward with real interest to learn and work in this difficult but highly productive field.
