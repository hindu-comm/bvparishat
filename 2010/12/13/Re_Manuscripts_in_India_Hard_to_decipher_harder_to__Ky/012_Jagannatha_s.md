Respected scholars,



I would like to bring twoworks available at ORI, Mysore, to the kind notice of all of you.

1.Bharuchi's commentary on Manusmriti(partially published at Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan).

2.Danalakshana, a jain workby SrIVaasupuujyarshi(unpublished).



I have made a note on manuscripts of both works. I humbly request all of you to read that note which is in PDF format.



S.Jagannatha.
