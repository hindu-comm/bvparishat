*December 13, 2010*



 This is the position taken by David Frawley and myself in our 2006 book *Hidden Horizons* and even earlier in our books and articles. The pre-Vedic and Proto-Vedic periods were oceanic extending to the east and west of peninsular India. I gave several talks this year in the U.S. and U.K. emphasizing the oceanic origins of the Vedic civilization. I will mention it briefly in my Pune talk also.



 This ties natural history to history and we won't have to rely on concoctions like the discredited Aryan myth, still the favoured paradigm of 'Indologists'.



 This will be the starting point of our projected multi-volume *People's History of India.*

New Light on Human Prehistory in the Arabo-Persian Gulf Oasis by Jeffrey I. Rose

  
Jeffrey I. Rose is a Research Fellow in the Institute of Archaeology and Antiquity at the University of Birmingham (Birmingham B15 2TT, United Kingdom \[[jeffrey...@gmail.com]()\]). Th e emerging picture of prehistoric Arabia suggests that early modern humans were able to survive periodic hyperarid oscillations by contracting into environmental refugia around the coastal margins of the peninsula. This paper reviews new paleoenvironmental, archaeological, and genetic evidence from the Arabian Peninsula and southern Iran to explore the possibility of a demographic refugium dubbed the “Gulf Oasis,” which is posited to have been a vitally significant zone for populations residing in southwest Asia during the Late Pleistocene and Early Holocene. These data are used to assess the role of this large oasis, which, before being submerged beneath the waters of the Indian Ocean, was well watered by the Tigris, Euphrates, Karun, and Wadi Batin rivers as well as subterranean aquifers flowing beneath the Arabian subcontinent. Inverse to the amount of annual precipitation falling across the interior, reduced sea levels periodically exposed large portions of the Arabo-Persian Gulf, equal at times to the size of Great Britain. Therefore, when the hinterlands were desiccated, populations could have contracted into the Gulf Oasis to exploit its freshwater springs and rivers. This dynamic relationship between environmental amelioration/desiccation and marine transgression/regression is thought to have driven demographic exchange into and out of this zone over the course of the Late Pleistocene and Early Holocene, as well as having played an important role in shaping the cultural evolution of local human populations during that interval. ...

  

Social Evolution in the Gulf Oasis

  
The model presented in this paper proposes that the basin served as a demographic refugium, facilitating the autochthonous development of a distinctly Arabian culture group. This is supported by the unique characteristics of lithic industries from both eastern Arabia and southern Zagros. Assemblages A and B at the Jebel Faya 1 rockshelter have no known correlates from any surrounding region. Many of the recently discovered “Middle,” “Upper” and “Epipaleolithic” assemblages in southern Iran are clearly distinguished from lithic industries in central and northern Zagros. Undoubtedly, the landscape desiccation and low sea levels of MIS 4 (74,000–60,000 BP) and MIS 2 (24,000–12,000 BP) would have affected hunter-gatherer ranges and mobility patterns. At that time, the interior savannas of Arabia became desiccated while tens of thousands of square kilometers of fertile land in the Gulf basin were exposed. It is possible these shifting environmental dynamics forced hunter-gatherers to increasingly rely on coastal resources rather than big- and medium-game hunting in the interior. The transition to aquatic subsistence and “beachcombing” is often invoked to explain the rapid modern human expansion across the Indian Ocean rim (e.g., Field and Lahr 2006; Field, Petraglia, and Lahr 2007; Mellars 2006; Stringer 2000). In this case, the Gulf Oasis model provides an environmentally driven mechanism that removed savannah hunting as a viable subsistence strategy during MIS 4, forcing the adoption of aquatic subsistence as biomass and freshwater resources became concentrated on the exposed continental shelf.

  
Fluctuating environmental conditions are likely to have caused populations tethered to the Gulf refugium to expand into adjacent areas during periods of amelioration and, subsequently, constrict back into the core zone during climatic downturns. Inevitably, this continuous flirtation with landscape carrying capacity must have impacted social evolution, as groups within the basin living under perpetually oscillating climatic conditions were persistently and consistently thrust into a recurring series of negative feedback loops (cf. Flannery 1968).

  
One example of such a dynamic process in the Gulf basin is described by Kennett and Kennett (2006), who argue that the formation of aquatic habitats along the northern shorelines of the Gulf in the Middle Holocene played a critical role in the process of state formation in southern Mesopotamia. They present a model in which marine transgression into the Gulf basin and increased precipitation during the climatic optimum created rich coastal zones that promoted the development of ‘Ubaid communities. The onset of aridity beginning around 6000 BP, along with a large population density, forced inhabitants to make use of the high groundwater table to experiment with irrigation farming. In turn, the innovation of large-scale agriculture hearkens back to the “hydraulic civilizations” of Wittfogel (1956), who proposed that irrigation had a cascading effect on social evolution and led to annual scheduling (calendars), labor coordination (differentiated leadership), and increased productivity (amassed wealth).

  
Emerging clues from the “Epipaleolithic” of Iran (e.g., Conard et al. 2005, 2006, 2007) and southern Oman (e.g., Rose and Usik 2009) suggest that human groups were present in these refugia immediately after the LGM. In the case of Sarab Syah spring, Epipaleolithic artifacts were discovered in conjunction with plant processing equipment, hinting at intensive plant exploitation in the southern Zagros during the Terminal Pleistocene. The lithic assemblage from the Al Hatab rockshelter, with OSL dates between 13,000 and 11,000 BP, suggests that subsequent Early Holocene hunter-gatherer range expansions emanated from within Arabia itself. However, until prehistoric research commences within the depths of the Gulf, most archaeological evidence from the Terminal Pleistocene and Early Holocene will remain hidden.

  
There was a virtual explosion of settlement around the shoreline of the Gulf in the Middle Holocene, coinciding with the final phase of marine incursion into the basin. More than just the sheer number of sites that were established within a single millennium (), the characteristics of these sites have profound implications for social evolution in the Gulf Oasis. By the time that indigenous groups became archaeologically visible during the ‘Ubaid 3 phase around 7500 cal BP, these communities had already undergone a complete Neolithic demographic transition and were, in fact, on the cusp of the Urban Revolution. This is exemplified in the suite of features found at ‘Ubaid-related sites, including permanent stone structures, pottery, date palm cultivation, animal husbandry, fishing, extensive trade networks, and advanced boat-building.

  
Three millennia after the proposed (re)settlement of indigenous ‘Ubaid 3 groups along the northern shoreline of the Gulf, the region became known as Sumeria and was populated by the world’s earliest literate civilization. Albeit epiphenomenal, it is interesting to note that the oldest known version of the ubiquitous Near Eastern flood myth, the “Eridu genesis” (Jacobsen 1981), was written by the inhabitants of this region. The link between flood mythology and marine incursion into the Arabo-Persian Gulf basin has already been thoroughly explored by a number of authors (see Cooke 1987; Hamblin 1987; Kennett and Kennett 2006; Lambeck 1996; Sanford 2006; Teller et al. 2000) and does not require any further elucidation.

  
This climatologically deterministic model of social evolution in a fertile yet conscripted oasis is the reiteration of a very old idea. The oasis hypothesis, first envisioned by Pumpelly (1908) and later developed by Childe (1928, 1936, 1952), was speculated to have occurred within the ancient oases of southwest Asia, around which dense human populations huddled for survival during the LGM, “united in an effort to circumvent the terrible power of drought” (Childe 1936:77). The Gulf may very well house Childe’s lost oasis, perhaps the most fertile part of the crescent until it was plunged beneath the waters of the Indian Ocean some 8,000 years ago.
