Dear Dr.KR,  
Those interested in tracing ancient Indian geography and the Gujarat-  
Rajasthan coast line as concealed in our Sanskrit texts including the  
Rigveda may read my papers coauthored with Dr BP Radhakrishna and  
comment.  
<http://www.scribd.com/doc/3246595/Geographical-Location-of-Vedic-Irina>  
  
<http://www.scribd.com/doc/13082218/Vedic-Archaeogeography>  
<http://www.scribd.com/doc/5991606/Where-could-have-been-Dwaraka-by-RNI-and-BPR>  
  
Prabhasa-kshetra-mahatmya of the skanda purana does talk of land/s  
that submerged under the sea. I am now traveling. If scholars in BVP  
are interested in scientific information in Sanskrit I can give the  
reference after 25th  
Thanks  
RN Iyengar
