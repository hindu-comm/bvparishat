Some information on our ancestry from one of my friends deeply interested in Indic studies:  
  

Hi everyone,  
  
We updated the podcast with episode 225, covering part of the recent debates on the origin of the Indo-Aryans and if indeed they represent any racially or ethnically distinct group.

  

We knowKoenraad Elst wrote in his update on the Aryan Invasion Debate - “Until the mid-19th century, no Indian had ever heard of the notion that his ancestors could be Aryan invaders from Central Asia who had destroyed the native civilization and enslaved the native population. Neither had South-Indians ever dreamt that they were the rightful owners of the whole subcontinent, dispossessed by the Aryan invaders who had chased them from North India, turning it into Aryavarta, the land of the Aryans. Nor had the low-caste people heard that they were the original inhabitants of India, subdued by the Aryans and forced into the prison house of caste which the conquerors imposed upon them as an early form of Apartheid.”

  

There have since been a debate that is often side tracked away from pure academics, to fresh biases on race, religion, nationalism, not to mention careers of scholars. Joining into the fray are the right wing Hindutva nationalists and their counter, the Marxist dogmatics.

  

Into this pot boiler, new science of genetics is shining fresh light.Mait Metspalu and fifteen co-authors analyzing 796 Indian and 436 Iranian mtDNAs in 2001, wrote -“Language families present today in India, such as Indo-European, Dravidic and Austro-Asiatic, are all much younger than the majority of indigenous mtDNA lineages found among their present-day speakers at high frequencies. It would make it highly speculative to infer, from the extant mtDNA pools of their speakers, whether one of the linguistically defined groups in India should be considered more ‘autochthonous’ than any other in respect of its presence in the subcontinent.” What does that mean ?

  

Then,Sanghamitra Sengupta, L. Cavalli-Sforza, Partha P. Majumder, and P. A. Underhill, conducting independent study of genetics of the people from the Indian subcontinent in 2006 found in their study -

1)Based on 728 samples covering 36 Indian populations, it announced in its very title how its findings revealed a “Minor Genetic Influence of Central Asian Pastoralists,” i.e. of the Indo-Aryans, and stated its general agreement with the previous study. For instance, the authors rejected the identification of some Y-DNA genetic markers with an “Indo-European expansion,” an identification they called “convenient but incorrect ... overly simplistic.” To them, the subcontinent’s genetic landscape was formed much earlier than the dates proposed for an Indo-Aryan immigration: “The influence of Central Asia on the pre-existing gene pool was minor. ... There is no evidence whatsoever to conclude that Central Asia has been necessarily the recent donor and not the receptor of the R1a lineages.”

2\) “Dravidian” authorship of the Indus-Sarasvati civilization rejected indirectly, since it noted, “Our data are also more consistent with a peninsular origin of Dravidian speakers than a source with proximity to the Indus....” They found, in conclusion, “overwhelming support for an Indian origin of Dravidian speakers.”

3\) The frequencies of R2 seems to mirror the frequencies of R1a (i.e. both lineages are strong and weak in the same social and linguistic subgroups). This may indicate that both R1a and R2 moved into India at roughly the same time or co-habited, although more research is needed. R2 is very rare in Europe.What what can one infer from that ?

  

Lluís Quintana-Murci,Vincent Macaulay,Stephen Oppenheimer,Michael Petraglia,and their associates wrote briefly and succinctly - "When Homo sapiens migrated out of Africa, he first reached South-West Asia around 75,000 BP, and from here, went on to other parts of the world. In simple terms, except for Africans, all humans have ancestors in the North-West of the Indian peninsula. In particular, one migration started around 50,000 BP towards the Middle East and Western Europe: “indeed, nearly all Europeans — and by extension, many Americans — can trace their ancestors to only four mtDNA lines, which appeared between 10,000 and 50,000 years ago and originated from South Asia".

  

We know that study of Y-chromosome and its mutations can indicate paternal lineage, where one mutation can happen on an average every 500 generations, and that the study of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) do the same to trace maternal ancestry.

  

Anyhow, we tried covering only a small part of the topic the best I could in episode 225. The debate is on, and will continue for some more time, and continuously new knowledge is added. Genetics is not yet an exacting science, but it is getting there. There are more information being literally dug out of the ground Archaeologically, every year. And there are more studies of the Vedas, particularly the Rig Veda, its inferences, references, connotations, geographic descriptions etc and comparison with other languages such as Dravidian, Uralic, Greek and so on.

  

We hope you will find the episode stimulating.
