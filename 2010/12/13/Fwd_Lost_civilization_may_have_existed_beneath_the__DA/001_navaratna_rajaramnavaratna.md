 The East was of course vastly most important since many of the flora and fauna (like rice and the humped Brahma bull) can be traced to it and is also united with the Indian mainland ecologically (Himalayan rivers and the monsoon climate). The West was less significant though the west coastal regions were the land of the Bhrigus.
