The holocene glaciation discussed about Persian Gulf has also to be read with the following interpretation of the coastline of Gujarat during the same period and coastline archaeological sites like Lothal, Padri, Dholaviar... The key lies in further researches to delineate the Rann of Kutch as an oasis

Archaeological sites provide evidences on shoreline fluctuation along the Gujarat coast at about 5000–4000 years BP. If a possible shoreline (Figure 4 <http://www.ias.ac.in/currsci/jul10/july10images/184.gif>) of Harappan period is drawn touching the Harappan ports, the following conclusions can be arrived at:

  

\(i\) The evidences indicate that in the Gulf of Khambhat, a distinct shifting of shoreline offshoreward is observed. On the other hand, south and western Saurashtra coasts appear to be stable, at least for the last 4000 years. (ii) If Dholavira is established as a port by more convincing findings than what is presented here, it will have significant importance in the palaeoclimatic study as well as archaeology and anthropology of the region. It would then mean that the Great Rann was navigable during the Harappan period (4500 years BP) and its subsequent siltation may have even triggered the decline of Harap-pan civilization in the area. (iii) The study clearly demonstrates the use of archaeology in establishing palaeo-shoreline. While the tectono-eustacy can only indicate the possibility of occurring of an event, evidences like this clearly support it.
