 My friend Sri Bhagwan Singh is right, only I would add to it Witzel's sorry performance at my talk at Cambridge, Mass when he tried to unsettle me with absurd questions. This is on You Tube.



 Ignore Witzel. He has lost his mental balance (assuming he had it at some time) and is now ranting about Hindutva. Like Hitler in his bunker he is seeing ghosts everywhere.This is not the conduct of a normal man.
