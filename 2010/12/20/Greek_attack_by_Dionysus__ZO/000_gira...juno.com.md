Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



Dear Shree Arun Mukhopadhya, Namaste!



Thanks for your quick reaction to my posting “Known and Unknown history” (Dec. 16-17, 2010). It seems that you have good information of the first Greek attack in 6777 BC by Dionysus. Please let us know the following so that we all grow in our knowledge from your knowledge.



(1) Who was Dionysus? A Greek king or military reader or else?

(2) How did he reach India if you are referring to attack on India, by sea route or by land route? Did he attack on the north India or on the south India? What name Dionysus used for India?

(3) What was the geographical size of India in 6777 BC? And did Indians repel the attack? If yes who were those Indians in India in 6777 BC? Do you have names of kings, kingdoms from India in 6777BC? Or was it friendly visit by Dionysus?

(4) After attack did Dionysus go back to Greece?

(5) Where and when did the word Greek and Greece come into existence? Did Dionysus bring with him Greek soldiers?

(6) Was there Greek nation in 6777 BC?

(7) Who were in Greek islands in 6777BC



If I misunderstood your words, “Arrian, Solinus, Megasthenes have stated the first Greek attack in 6777 BC—“, please correct me.

If the attack was not on India, then where was it? I am waiting to learn interesting part of Greek and Indian ancient history from you Thanks. N. R. Joshi.
