There is no point in discussing with complete ignorants. You may read  
any book by any ancient Greek/Roman author and read their first  
comments about India. You have not read a single line about what you  
are eager to teach others. Even if you get the information how it can  
be understood-e.g if you are left in 'Dvaita-vana' of Mahabharata era,  
how it can be recognised? What species of plants existed then? Can the  
same or similar plants survive now. How we know that it is not the  
Connaught place of present time now? There is complete list of Indian  
kings from Ikshvaku from 1-11-8576 BC-without that there was no basis  
for Megasthenes to write about 154 generation of Indian kings from  
Dionysus (Father Baccus) or Indian king Bahu-(34th from Ikshvaku) to  
Chandragupta-1 of Gupta empire. Even R.C. Mazumdar in his 'Ancient  
India'-page 132 (p/135 in hindi translation) has quoted Pliny (on  
authority of Megasthenes) to tell about army of Andhra kings. That is  
possible only if Megasthenese had come after Andhra kings, not 1000  
years before them in Maurya period. Same Professor of Usmania  
University maintains 2 versions like R.C. Mazumdar. For Andhra glory,  
Megasthenes was in Gupta period, for history in Maurya period. All the  
above books are freely available on internet and in all libraries  
where you read or taught. But there should be desire to know-not to  
spread ignorance. 'Oriental' institutes have done many  
wonders.Students in history hons class reads that Shankaracharya was  
in 9th century AD. Same students read in paper in Hindi, Marathi and  
Bangla and Assamese that it was period of Gorakhnath and they start  
with nathapanthi literature. Anybody trying to write truth will be  
failed by Orientalists who do not read but teach.-Arun

\> Thanks for your quick reaction to my posting “Known and Unknown history” (Dec. 16-17, 2010). It seems that you have good information of the first Greek attack in 6777 BC by Dionysus. Please let us know the following so that we all grow in our knowledge from your knowledge.  
\>  
\> (1)  Who was Dionysus? A Greek king or military reader or else?  

\> (2)  How did he reach \<?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" />India if you are referring to attack on India, by sea route or by land route? Did he attack on the north India or on the south India? What name Dionysus used for India?  

\> (3)  What was the geographical size of India in 6777 BC? And did Indians repel the attack? If yes who were those Indians in India in 6777 BC? Do you have names of kings, kingdoms from India in 6777BC? Or was it friendly visit by Dionysus?  
\> (4)  After attack did Dionysus go back to Greece?  
\> (5)  Where and when did the word Greek and Greece come into existence? Did Dionysus bring with him Greek soldiers?  
\> (6)  Was there Greek nation in 6777 BC?  
\> (7)  Who were in Greek islands in 6777BC  
\>  
\> If I misunderstood your words, “Arrian, Solinus, Megasthenes have stated the first Greek attack in 6777 BC—“, please correct me.  
\> If the attack was not on India, then where was it? I am waiting to learn interesting part of Greek and Indian ancient history from you Thanks. N. R. Joshi.
