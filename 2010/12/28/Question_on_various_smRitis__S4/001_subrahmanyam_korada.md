namo vidvadbhyah

The 'Sm.rtisandarbha' of Manasukharoy More , 5,Clive Row , Calcutta (1952, 1953)  
contains more Sm.rtis . He was sending copies free of cost , a DhArmika .

Nir.nayasindhu of Kamalakarabhatta etc have compared some Sm.rtis .

Manusm.rti (1987) and Gautamasm.rti (1966) were published by  
Chowkhamba, Varanasi , with Hindi Translations . Better not to depend  
upon Translations.

Why differences ?

It is difficult to find out as which is Dharma and which is Adharma --  
dharmasya tattvam nihitam guhAyAm .

Patanjali in Paspas'A of MahAbhAsyam says - parAvarajnA.h  
viditaveditavyA.h sAk.sAtk.rtadharmA.na.h .r.sayo babhUvu.h . .R.sis  
were able to discern Dharma thru Yogipratyak.sa .

MImAmsakas (see S'lokavArtikam - Pratyak.sa) do not accept  
Yogipratyak.sa . Veda and  
Sm.rtis , as per Sm.rtyadhikar.nam of First AdhyAya , which follow  
S'ruti are PamA.nam .

S'ruterivArtham sm.rtiranvagacchat - KAlidAsa in Raghuvams'a .

The following verse enumerates the Pramanas of Dharma (Manusm.rti 2-6,  
first leg is seen in Gautamasm.rti also ) -

vedo'khilo dharmamUlam sm.rtis'Ile ca tadvidAm I  
AcAras'caiva sAdhUnAm Atmanastu.s.tireva ca II

Finally it is 'Atmanastu.s.ti.h -- in S'Akuntalam Du.syanta follows  
this - satAm hi [sandehapade.su](http://sandehapade.su) [v.rtti.su](http://v.rtti.su)  
pramA.namanta.hkara.naprav.rttaya.h .

Vedo'khilo dharmamUlam --

AnantA vai vedA.h (KA.thaka in TaittirIya) -says Veda .

Veda has got two forms -- S'bda and Artha (PA.nini 4-2-58 tadadhIte  
tadveda) . The S'abda cannot be 'ananta' but Artha can . So here Veda  
, thru [Lak.sa.nA](http://Lak.sa.nA) , means VeDartha .

Since Veda offers the message like a king ( Prabhusammito veda.h -  
KAvyaprakAs'a.h)  
it isdifficult to Know the 'TAtparyam' .  
PurA.nas and ItihAsas explain the same message like a friend (mitrasammitam) .  
KAvyas spread the Same like a young wife(kAntAsammitam).

The Dharmas differ due to Yuga,age , caste,health, gender , des'a,  
kAla , pAtra etc .  
In K.rtayuga there are only two castes (from Spanish 'cus.tA' = group)  
- BrAhma.na and S'Udra.

In Udyogaparva , StrIparva etc Dharmas on different counts are described .

There are exceptions to old people , newly delivered ladies, children  
, people suffering from chronic deseases etc .

Finally,l Dharma is to be performed according to 'S'akti' , i.e. yathAs'akti .

Saptar.sis enquire PArvaty (KumArasambhavam)-

api svas'aktyA tapasi pravartase ? s'arIramAdyam khalu dharmasAdhanam !

The second leg is taken from Manusm.rti .

Also in the same context ' na [dharmav.rdde.su](http://dharmav.rdde.su) vayassamIk.syate ' .

One should not neglect health -- yAmamadhye na bhoktavyam dviyAmam na  
tu langhayet (Carakam - Ayurveda ) - do not have any food within three  
hours after sunrise but do not cross six hours ( there will be heart  
- attack ) .

If you touch VedAnta ,S'ankarAcArya comments on GItAvAkyam -

'sarvadharmAn parityajya mAmekam s'ara.nam vraja'

Here DharmAn means - dharmAn adharmAms'ca .

Gautamasm.rti (1-3) - [d.r.s.to](http://d.r.s.to) dharmavyatikrama.h sAhasam ca mahatAm  
(Paras'urAma , on the orders of his father killed his mother .  
VyAkhyAnam - MitAk.sarA - rAgadve.sanibandhanatvAt .

When there is a tie what to do ? -- mahAjano yena gatassa panthA.h .

The topic is unending -- Ananta.h .
