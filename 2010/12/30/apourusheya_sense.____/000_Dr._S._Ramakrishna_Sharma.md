Respected Scholars,  
  
An Avadhoota was asked:  
#In what sense the Vedas are apourusheya?  
He answered:  
The Vedas are apourusheya NOT in the pourusheya sense;  
they are apourusheya in the apourusheya sense.  
#What does it mean?  
All pourusheya sense is and comes from the pourusheya senses;  
apourusheya sense comes ONLY through apourusheya sense!  
#Then, just as there is Divyam chakshu there is Divyam Shrotram!  
It is Chakshu as well as Shrotram. Hence, Rishi is Mantra Drashta.

#vyasaprasadat shrutavan.. what is that Vyasa Prasada?  
It is the capability to see and hear things and matters divine from afar.  
  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
  
Vedic Samskrutam is co-existent with the Vedas; the Vedas are  
co-existent with the Cosmos; Vedic Samskrutam thus ceases to be  
one of those languages created by and in the History.

Does it require to be an Avadhoota to comprehend the above thoughts?  
  
Dhanyo'smi
