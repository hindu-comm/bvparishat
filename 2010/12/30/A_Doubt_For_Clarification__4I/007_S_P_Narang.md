Regards, Tamil was recognized as a Prakrit as Dramil and quoted sometimes in the  
works of roots also. If one goes deep and deeper, there is hardly any difference  
in the phonetics of Sanskrit and Tamil except a few sounds. a few of the roots  
have also similarity both in sound and sense. The movement is to and fro. A few  
sounds can be traced from Sanskrit particularly the derivatives from Lr. which  
have somilarity in Tamil and MIL of North.

Generally words like paapad.a, sad.aka are ety. ignored. But they can have  
similarity via Lr. and the change is similar. It appears that the suffix kta  
which appears in the form of t.a in Tamil is the locus for the analysis of  
Tamil. Deeper analysis of the words and roots may prove further similarity. The  
local influence on Tamil and North MIL cannot be ruled out and will have to be  
searched in scholarly spirit. Thanks to the writings of Prof. Emeneau, a great  
scholar in both the languages, can become the ideal guide for further research.  
We should not be guided by political motives. I donot talk of script here.
