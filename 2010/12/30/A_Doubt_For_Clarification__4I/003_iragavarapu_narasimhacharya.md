Dear Scholars,  
praNamyA."The language DraaviDee is mentioned as the "Apabhramsha" of

  
the Aryan family of the  

languages.How is it made the head of the family of languages "as the  
Dravidian family" when it is a part of the Aryan family? How is  
Caldwell's division justified? He put the languages "Telugu,Tamil.  
MaLayaaLam and KannaDa"(Main Languages Of The South India) as belonged  
to the Dravidian family  
of the languages of India.Does the language "DraaviDee" deserve to be  
categorised as "A Head of the family when it is a part of the Aryan  
family? This is my doubt.This may kindly be clarified.Please let me  
know if I am mistaken in my presentation of my view.I humbly accept  
your corrections.  
Regards,  
ins
