Dear Scholar Friends,  
praNamyA.As you all know the Britishers are renowned for their "Divide  
and Rule"policy.The Bishop Caldwel divided the languages  
in India into two groups as "Aryan and Dravidian".But we find the  
"Dravidian" language as an "ApabhraMsha" in the commentary of  
"MRicChakaTikaM"(The Clay Cart) authored by the poet king  
"ShUdraka".The commentator's name is "pRidhveedhara"He says as  
follows."अपभ्रंशे शकाराभीरचाण्डालशबरद्राविडोढ्रजाः। हीना वनेचराणां च  
विभाषा (विविधाः भाषाः) सप्त कीर्तिताः" इति.।This is on the first page  
of the  
drama after the prayer.Here we find the :Dravidian"language described  
as ApabhraMsha" and related to the "Aryan family of the languages.  
Please let me know whether the language "Tamil" belongs to the Aryan family  
of the languages or not.  
Regards,  
insacharya.
