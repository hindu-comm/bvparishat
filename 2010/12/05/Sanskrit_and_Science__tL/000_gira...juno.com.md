Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



I am all for promotion of Sanskrit. However ask young generation of India about their impression about Sanskrit. Please take one paragraph from the high school level Physics written in English. Translate that in Sanskrit using meaningful Sanskrit terminology. Now use all intricacies of Sanskrit grammar and prove that Sanskrit translation makes more sense scientifically that original English.



To the best of my knowledge people look at Sanskrit as language of the ancient Hindu scriptures (no hope understanding in one life time), Hindu liturgy (noYajamaana except fewunderstand what priest is murmuring-right or wrong), language of Yajnas of questionable outcomes,
language of Sanskrit Pundits arguing endlessly on Ghata, Pata, Gau and Devadatta Odanam Pacati using Sandhis to make ten shabdas connected with each other making even more difficult by pouring Samaasa on the top of that. Sanskrit is promoted as spiritual language for salvation, for achieving Dharma. When it comes to Dharma and salvation, young generation does not have those priorities. They are looking for a good paying jobs. Such jobs one gets by learning English. They want to buy cars. I saw advertisements in India, "Learn English from elementary school to go to America", The whole computer science and IT industry promotes English whole heartedly. I am communicating to you from USA, this would not have possible without the western invention of computers. Please remember Sanskrit or Sanskrit Pundit did not invent computer but computer discovered Sanskrit for its possible use.



Although there were large number of ancient treatises in Sanskrit on secular sciences like medicine, physics, metallurgy in ancient India, current Sanskrit teaching does not emphasize (in my opinion) that aspect our heritage. On the other hand all Sanskrit pundits find science in their ancient books after it is discovered by the western science. So India and her Sanskrit is a big old storehouse of knowledge always sleeping but when the jolt comes from the west, then first reaction is 'O it was invented by us thousands of years ago" and then business people would like to make money so they import technologies of movies, telephone, mobile phone, computers, railroads cars, microwave ovens, laundry machines, airplanes.



My effortsare to find Anvarthaka Sanjnyaas for modern scientific terminology which will tell the meanings instantaneously without much thinking. Past efforts in this direction have only limited success. So I followed the path of investigating meanings of Sanskrit words, their origin and see whether we can find new dimension of Sanskrit in addition to her superior grammar. My discovery of VarNavaada or Phonemic symbolism offers interesting results on the "Internal Beauty of Sanskrit". And listeners start smiling with joy. They say this is new.



What I am saying is this -Science and Technology are as important as Nyaaya shaastra, and VyaakaraNa shaastra.Somebody told me in the ancient India there were technical books in dog Sanskrit. We have to start research in this direction. I become introspective when I see the details of Sanskrit grammar in postings of scholars like Dr. Korada and others and see side by side growth of English in India in every aspect of life.

Please do not misunderstand me . I am not here to demote activities in Sanskrit but to promote new aspect of Sanskrit words. Thanks. Sorry for long e-mail. N.R.Joshi
