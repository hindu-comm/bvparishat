Good point, Rajiv ji. We are still waiting for the Sarasvati Pratima of Bhoja Raja stolen from Dhar in MP. They have an empty niche there where an eternal lamp burns awaiting the reinstallation of Sarasvati in Bhojashala. You should write up a counter to Rajan Zed and say how these pieces will get auctioned after their value for art-collectors increases by such world circuits of our sacred murti-s.
