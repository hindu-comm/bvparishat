Witzel's report of the incident:

He did > so only after the chair, Kapila Vatsyayana, had insisted 3 times. His > aim: he wanted me to publicly revoke a one line sentence in an old, > 1995 paper.

Witzel occupies furniture in a so-called Harvard Univ. claiming to teach Samskrtam varnamaalaa and cocks-a-snook with his bled nose again and again.
