namaste,

nicely written, this is perhaps the beginning of how yoga was taken away from us, and we are told that it is not yours.

key terms Jeffrey Armstrong says are, first they say it does not belong to hindu religion, then that means two things:

\(1\) i am not doing any error, i belong to you the same religion (2) you can also take this and say this does not belong to Indians any more



we should be watchful, for such terms, we should do something globally, that this knowledge is part of daily lives, such as in schools by children. or in some ways it is widespread in our country on a regular basis. Best way is to keep Samskritam alive, because that is difficult to take away from us.
