Kalyanaramanji is right. Mer is related to Meru. It is a building  
design, but it can mean local centres-of power, geographical  
reference. In that respect Jain and common puranas have same  
description. Interestingly, there is an IJesselmeer in Netherlands-  
that is water desert-undersea swamp in north part. It appears that  
some towns were originally named due to design. Vajra-nagar (Basra) of  
Iraq as in harivamsha-purana was in shape of Vajra. That is not the  
usual weapon shown in dramas in shape of back-bone-it is actually  
diamond shape which is hardest matter. Molecular structure of such  
matter will have least number of surfaces-a triangular pyramid. This  
is shape of molecular carbon-called Tri-kakud parvata as the best  
carbon in Atharva-veda (4/9/1-10, 19/44/1-10, 19/45/1-5), Paippalada  
samhita (1/55/1-4, 8/3/1-13). It is called Namaka-sulemani in Arabic-  
but these are not related to any real mountains. It is Tri-kakuda  
=pyramid with 3 edges.  
Vajra-nagar was joint of 2 triangles around river along the coast  
(diamond shape of playing cards), so it was called Vajra.  
Original design of Towns by Vishnu was circular, followed by Varuna.  
They were called Uru-उरुं हि राजा वरुण श्चकार (ऋग् वेद १/२४/८)  
शं नो विष्णुरुरुक्रमः (ऋग् वेद १/९०/१)  
Most towns in south India and oldest town of Iraq are Ur or Uru.  
Possibly in that sense, Megasthenes has written that Palibothri on  
Yamuna banks (Delhi) was one of the towns built by Hercules. It may  
mean pillar of Hercules (Kutub Minar-indicated 1500 years before  
Kutubuddin by Ibn Batuta) or town design in circular shape. Actually,  
it was Indra-prastha built by Yudhishthira.  
Towns designed by Indra were rectangular-old Bejing town of China was  
perfect example. These were called Pura. Model is Gop-puram of temples  
in south India. That is related to 4 faced Meru described in jaina  
texts. Meru as north pole is just an imaginary axis, but world map of  
north hemisphere were built in 4sheets of 90 degree width each. Every  
purana has stated that India covers 1/4 of earth lotus. Books of  
architecture have been translated by S. Umapati (Kumbakonam) and H.N.  
Somani (Solapur), but they have stressed on building design-not the  
town design.  
Pamir had 4 faces in that 4 mountain ranges emerged from that-so it  
was Pran-meru (eastern Meru). Its town Pushkar (Bukhara) was 12 degree  
west of Ujjain (Vishnu purana 2/8) and had 4 highways in 4 direction.  
Similar highways emanated from other Merus-Kilimanjaro in Kenya  
(central Meru) and from Kuzco in Peru (Apara-meru = Peru). Ajamer had  
been called Pushkar of Indra-prasha in Skanda and Vayu puranas. It was  
given by Duryodhana in bargain for Yadava army fighting on his side.  
Ajaya-meru and Pushkar-both names are linked with 4 faced Meru or  
lotus of 4 petals.  
Coastal towns needed breast-wall facing sea-that was called  
Vakshas=Okha near Dwaraka and Okhotsky at east end of Siberia. Coast  
reason was Bela-bhumi as in Bela-Rus.  
Study on ancient town designs is very little-Arun
