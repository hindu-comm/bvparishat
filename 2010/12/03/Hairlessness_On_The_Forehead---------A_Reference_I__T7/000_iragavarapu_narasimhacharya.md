Dear Scholar Friends,  
praNamyA. We find hair on every part of our body excepting the  
forehead.Why is it so? We find a reference for this in our  
Scriptures.The file attached here-with will explain to you in  
detail.See the wonders in the creation.We know that any literature  
will reflect the society.Our Vedic literature seems to be the  
reflection of creation.Does the modern western science tell any thing  
about this feature? your opinions are invited.  
Regards,  
insacharya.
