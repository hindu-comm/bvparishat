respected sir,

if you can see the present status of Sanskrit in north reason at least, it is our govt. who is trying to make the status of Sanskrit very weak.

they are making Sanskrit as an optional language while Hindi iscompulsory.

student are takingFrench/Germaninstead of sanskrit.

if we can tell them that computational Sanskrit is new field in the area of Sanskrit+ IT, then can read sanskrit instead of other western language.

we can show them a new job sector as well.

you also accepted this that govt is giving a lot of amount to promote Hindi.

WHY NOT FOR SANSKRIT? Sanskrit can easily connect India from east to west and north to south.

And one more thing: if today school going students will not take interest, who will read Sanskrit after 10 or 15 years?

if Sanskrit scholars will not get any good jobs in govt sector by our beloved Govt., will it be helpful for sanskrit as a subject to study in modern job oriented time?

Should Sanskrit getattention of our govt or not?

Should Sanskrit get fund and promotion or not?

Should sanskrit be enrolled as our Mothertongue or not?

and finally

in this census are you going to write Sanskrit as your Mothertongue or not?

  

hope you will and we will do this!

  

namaskar:)
