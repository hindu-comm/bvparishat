RESPECTED SCHOLARS,  
  
1. WE LOST A CHANCE TO MAKE SANSKRIT AS OUR OFFICIAL LANGUAGE DURING EARLY TIMES AFTER INDEPENDENCE IN OUR CONSTITUTION.  
  
2. WE KNEW THAT SANSKRIT HAD BEEN A LINK LANGUAGE AMONG THE SCHOLARS BEFORE VARIOUS INVADING EMPERORS AND THE EAST INDIA COMPANY WERE RULING US.  
  
3. ONCE THE SANSKRIT-MEDIUM-SHASTRA LEARNING TRADITION IS MAINTAINED; THEN THERE IS NO SCOPE OF DECLINING THAT TRADITION. DAY-TO-DAY CONVERSATION AT LEAST BETWEEN THE DISCIPLE AND THE GURU IS ONE OF THE POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS.  
  
4. ONCE YOU ACCEPT YOUR NATION AS YOUR MOTHER, THEN THERE IS NO PROBLEM FOR SUCH ACCEPTORS TO ESTABLISH SANSKRIT AS THEIR MOTHER-TONGUE.  
  
5. IT IS OUR DUTY TO MAKE UNDERSTAND THE PUBLIC THAT HOW MUCH INFLUENCE SANSKRIT HAS IN EACH AND EVERY DIALECT IN INDIA.  
  
6. IT IS UNFORTUNATE THAT PEOPLE STOP LEARNING SANSKRIT ONCE THEY GET EMPLOYED EVEN IN SANSKRIT INSTITUTIONS. IF A GOOD STUDENT OF SANSKRIT WHO CAN MASTER EITHER VYAKARANA OR NYAYA OR THE OTHER; HE/SHE CAN LEARN AND PROPAGATE THE OTHER. BUT HOW MANY OF THEM DO?  
  
7. ONCE YOU DETERMINE TO ESTABLISH A GOAL, THEN LOCAL DIALECTS AND SO CALLED FOREIGN LINK-LANGUAGES ARE NO MORE OBSTACLES.  
  
8. NOW THE QUESTION IS HOW AND WHEN WE CAN WIN THE MIND OF PUBLIC TO REINSTATE SANSKRIT AS:  
 A. THE LANGUAGE FOR HIGHER EDUCATION,  
 B. AN ICON OF OUR RICH TRADITION & HERITAGE,  
 C. THE ABSOLUTE SUBSTITUTE FOR ALL LOCAL DIALECTS AND SO CALLED 
 FOREIGN LANGUAGES,  
 D. AN OPEN DOOR AS A UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE.  
  
Regards,  
Narayanan
