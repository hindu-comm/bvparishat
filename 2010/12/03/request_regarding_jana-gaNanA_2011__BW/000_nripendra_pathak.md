respected all,

namaskar.

According to govt. figures, the number of Sanskrit Speakers are decreasing.

Any policy in favor of sanskrit, we could get only by showing them the number of SPEAKERS of SANSKRIT in therecensus 2011 which is starting in Feb.

As SANSKRIT BOOK FAIR is a great event to convey thismassage and request them to say that there Mother tongue i.e. First language is Sanskrit.

So please do it with your best possible effort to SHOW THE REAL PICTURE OF SANSKRIT AS A LIVING SPOKEN LANGUAGE TO OUR GOVT SO THAT THEY MUST TAKE IT INTO THERE NOTICE AND TO PROMOTE SANSKRIT AS OURHERITAGE.

PLEASE request all to do this for Sanskrit.
