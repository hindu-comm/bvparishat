In order to promote Sanskrit , I rather think ,one and all should  
support Dr Jamadagni .  
I do not think the enumerators come with a list of languages . They  
note down the language of the person as claimed .

All most all ,in a country like India , are either bi-linguals or  
tri-linguals or so .

Although one knows several languages the one that is required /  
demanded by the circumastances is used and thus there is nothing wrong  
by claiming that Sanskrit is  
Mother Tongue .
