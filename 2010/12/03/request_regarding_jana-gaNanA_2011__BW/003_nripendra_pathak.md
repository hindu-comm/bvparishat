respected sir, when any question for a positive policy regarding promotion of Sanskrit in North India comes in front of our Govt., they simply say that that in india total 14000 Sanskrit speakers are there (According to census 2001).thats why they try to force this meth that Sanskrit is no longer a living language.

i know that this is their tuShtikaraNa  policy for aparticulargroup.

govt. will do anything on the basis of census of Sanskrit speaker, it is quite clear. thats why i am requesting all sanskrit lovers to come forward ans say: YES! WE SPEAK SANSKRIT. AND SANSKRIT IS OUR MOTHER TONGUE.

GOVT. is not prepared to make aseparatecount of Sanskrit Speakers, it is a well known fact. in Feb we have census, and its not possible to force govt. in a short timing to do this.

its a good idea but it may go to next census,if triedhardlyandheartily.

what is possible in short time is this that we may inspire others to enroll themselves as a Sanskrit Speaker person of India.

this is good or not? please reply.

othersfeedback is also required .

So please give uor idea regarding this.

thanks.
