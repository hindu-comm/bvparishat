Each point in lead note is baseless and its reading is waste of time-  
(1) Known history means only distortions in British era. (2) There is  
no basis of the time of 600 BC-who decided and in what calender  
system? Except blind worship of Maxmuller, is there any evidence? (3)  
What archeological evidence of Aryan migration or of clans was found?  
(4)Even Greek historians were not ignorant like British forgerers. All  
have written that India is only country where no body has come from  
outside. Arrian, Solinus, Megasthenes have stated the first Greek  
attack in 6777 BC by Dionysus. Has it been changed to 600 BC like  
Maxmuller changed 15000 years to 1500 BC. Schwanbeck had written that  
Indians had not attacked any country since 15000 years as it was self  
sufficient and had no need to loot (like Alexander or British). After  
15000 was copied by Maxmuller and divided by 10, it was replaced by  
'never'. (5) History of Rama is unknown as his birth place is under  
legal dispute. It is at least under dispute by louyalists, but where  
are palaces or birth places of 'known' kings-Ashok, Chandragupta-2,  
Nanda, Prithviraj Chauhan, Harshavardhana (different from Sriharsha-  
read by all but still unknown), Akbar, Ibrahim Lodhi, Pulakeshin  
Chalukya etc. (7) Why stress on archeology in which there is no study  
while it is ignored in 1000 cases?-Arun

\> In the known history of India from 600 BC to modern times, Mangols, Shakas, Kushanas, Greeks, Jews, Huns, Arabians, Persians(Paarasi) Ethiopians, Somalians , French, British, Portugese, have entered India in thousands. A lot of Hindu Gujaratis trace their ancestry to Greeks. This can be confirmed with certain health conditions acquired by Gujaratis from Greeks.

\> The ancient people whom we repeatedly refer to as Indo-Aryans (following habits of European scholars) had clan names which are available from the books on their history. Treating the ancient people from the Middle-East as nameless is smearing out the true history of Eurasia. And these Middle-East clans have matrimonial relations with clans of the subcontinent. Although there is nothing wrong in performing genetic studies, certainly it is wrong to put hundreds of ancient clans in one big bag called Indo-Aryans.

\> In other countries, people give birth to languages. In India languages gave birth to unknown people called Aryans and Dravidians. At the time of Alexander 326 BC, there were thousands of clan names in India. History of clans is the true history. Strange Indeed? Thanks. N. R. Joshi.
