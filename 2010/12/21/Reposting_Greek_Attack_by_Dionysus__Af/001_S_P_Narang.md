Sir, It is an excellent field of exploration. We know less about the subject before Alexander. Of course, the history, tribes, geographical changes etc. existed. We do not find in the books due to lack of the evidence. Let us try to explore the connections including trade which was unbroken and continous. Even good books on Indian history miss the anthropological information of Indian population. Let us be liberal in our approach and try our ancestory which may be in the Brhadbhaarata and not limited to Kurukshetra are only. Let us restore the patches and try to come to totality. Regards, spnarang
