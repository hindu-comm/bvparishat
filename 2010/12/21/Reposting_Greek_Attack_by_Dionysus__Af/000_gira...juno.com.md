Respected Scholars, Namaskar!

I tender my apology for misspelling the last name of Shree Arunji. I am reposting the article with correction.

Dated Dec. 20, 2010



Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



Dear Shree Arun Upadhyay, Namaste!



Thanks for your quick reaction to my posting “Known and Unknown history” (Dec. 16-17, 2010). It seems that you have good information of the first Greek attack in 6777 BC by Dionysus. Please let us know the following so that we all grow in our knowledge from your knowledge.



(1) Who was Dionysus? A Greek king or military reader or else?

(2) How did he reach India if you are referring to attack on India, by sea route or by land route? Did he attack on the north India or on the south India? What name Dionysus used for India?

(3) What was the geographical size of India in 6777 BC? And did Indians repel the attack? If yes who were those Indians in India in 6777 BC? Do you have names of kings, kingdoms from India in 6777BC? Or was it friendly visit by Dionysus?

(4) After attack did Dionysus go back to Greece?

(5) Where and when did the word Greek and Greece come into existence? Did Dionysus bring with him Greek soldiers?

(6) Was there Greek nation in 6777 BC?

(7) Who were in Greek islands in 6777BC



If I misunderstood your words, “Arrian, Solinus, Megasthenes have stated the first Greek attack in 6777 BC—“, please correct me.

If the attack was not on India, then where was it? I am waiting to learn interesting part of Greek and Indian ancient history from you Thanks. N. R. Joshi.Dec. 16, 2010  
  
In the known history of India from 600 BC to modern times, Mangols, Shakas, Kushanas, Greeks, Jews, Huns, Arabians, Persians(Paarasi) Ethiopians, Somalians , French, British, Portuguese, have entered India in thousands. A lot of Hindu Gujaratis trace their ancestry  
to Greeks. This can be confirmed with certain health conditions acquired by Gujaratis from Greeks.  
  
The ancient people whom we repeatedly refer to as Indo-Aryans (following habits of European scholars) had clan names which are available from the books on their history. Treating the ancient people from the Middle-East as nameless is smearing out the true history of Eurasia. And these Middle-East clans have matrimonial relations with clans of the subcontinent. Although there is nothing wrong in performing genetic studies, certainly it is wrong to put hundreds of ancient clans in one big bag called Indo-Aryans.  
  
In other countries, people give birth to languages. In India languages gave birth to unknown people called Aryans and Dravidians. At the time of Alexander 326 BC, there were thousands of clan names in India. History of clans is the true history. Strange Indeed?  
Thanks. N. R. Joshi.
