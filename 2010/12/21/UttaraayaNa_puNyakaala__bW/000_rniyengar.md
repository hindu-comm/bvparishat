Dear Scholars,  
Greetings of the UttaraayaNa Day, the shortest day of the year. This  
is the day on either side of which Sun was observed to be stationary  
for ten days from Vedic times. That is the solar number 21. In many  
years but not in all this day coincides with the Vaikuntha Ekaadashi  
when the uttaraayaNa doors in the VisNu temples (SriRangam,  
Tirumala....) opens. Unfortunately many of our panchangams show this  
wrongly to be on 14th January. I learn that HDAS is holding its first  
conference on correcting the Panchangas this week at TTD. I hope the  
luminaries of the Acharya Sabha will take steps to correct the winter  
solstice day (obviously the other surya sankrantis) and see that  
ordinary Hindus are not made the victims of ignorance of some  
publishers.  
  
Quite interestingly the Udagayana is happening on a PourNima and  
eclipse. In the Vedic times a solar eclipse occurred on a similar  
occasion. PC Sengupta in his scholarly book on ancient chronology  
dated this event to the 4th millennium BC eventhough there are a few  
difficulties about this event.  
  
I wish the learned scholars of BVP discuss the point today being the  
correct UttaraayaNa for doing the Pitr. TarpaNa also and take a stand.  
If I am wrong I like to be corrected.  
  
Thanks  
RN Iyengar
