Dear Shri Jagannatha, Namaste!

I appreciate your postings on this list. You are a open minded scholar and ready to add to your knowledge.You have shown willingness to look into Zend Avesta. I like that. At the end of this month there is conference of Zoroastrian people (Paarsi and Persians) in Houston. I attended their past three conferences in Houston. Unfortunately I was the only Hindu person attending these conferences although more than 50 000 Hindus live in Houston area.

Please look into the history of the Persian Empire of the known history (536 BC to 326 BC) and her wars with Greeks. Both Persians, Parthiansand Sassanians were ancient cousin brothers of Indians across the Kabul (Kubha) river. Unfortunately when Arabs destroyed Sassanian Iran, original people who did not want to accept Islam, ran to India. These are our Paarsi people. Their contribution to the development of India is well known through the names Tata, Bhabha, Godarej. Although both Afghanistan and Iran are Muslims today, they have kept their ancient tradition of celebrating new year day on March 21 of each year. Thanks. N.R.Joshi.

Dear Sri RN Iyengar,

I have to admit candidly that I am zero in Zend-Avesta.Â Since I do notÂknow ÂanythingÂ about Zend-Avesta, I can not answerÂ yourÂ
question.Â ButÂ your letter aroused my curiosity to read the literature on the subject available throughÂInternet. I have already started to read.

Â

Anybody can do that and there is noÂ speciality of mine.

Â

I sincerely apologize you. Thank you for yourÂ letter which created curiosity in me to read on the subject.

Â

Sincerely yours,

Jagannatha.
