Dera indicates a temporary settlement -for army camp, camp for a  
function or large gathering. It is same as Sarai (Ashraya) in Moghal-  
sarai (east UP). It is a feature of desert areas, where sand dunes  
shift like a whole village. This will also be a feature of frequent  
movements of army for attack or defence. For individual houses, it  
means rest-houses away from permanent village, temporary residence.  
These are based on common uses-Nipata. As Arab also is desert, the  
word may be of Arabic origin. In India, it might be from famous  
'Dhara' town of Malva, built by a Bhoja king with Kalidasa-3. That way  
'Dera' indicates floating population. High places are called  
'Tibba' (also in Himachala), or Dungari (Konda in Andhra, Karnataka),  
Diha or Dihari in Riverine areas- which are safe from floods. In  
Arabic, 'Dara' (Dhara of sanskrit ?)is a place of residence-e.g  
Daragah (place of worship). It has same concept as 'Grih' of sanskrit  
which holds (grahana) family within it.
