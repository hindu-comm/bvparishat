Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



I am interested in knowing the origins of names from Rajastan. These are



Mewar, Marwar, the ending in Charo-daro, Sukhtan-daro, the ending in Naaga-zari and also name in Pakistan-Dera Ismail-khan. I am interested in the origin of name Dera and not in Ismail-khan. Thanks. N.R.Joshi
