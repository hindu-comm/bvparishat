Namaste.

Research Institute gets completely rapidly.  
Typo.  
Sri Arun Kumar Upadhyay has many a time posted on how BORI also  
proves to be faithful to Maxmullers's Sanskrit and MW Dictionary than  
being true to Samskrutam and Samskruti.(I may be corrected if I am wrong.)  
Kindly provide the details of BORI dictionary project here so that it may be  
studied keeping in view the points marked by Sri Arun Ji.  
  
Dhanyo'smi.
