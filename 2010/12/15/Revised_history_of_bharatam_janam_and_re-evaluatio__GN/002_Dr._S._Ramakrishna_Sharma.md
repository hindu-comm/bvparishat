Namaste.  
  
Whereas the title ****People's History of India** definitely draws the attention of the European mind  
and the Indian minds which have the European/English cultural mindset, at least  
a Bharatiya Sub title in Samskrutam would enhance the value of the work and content.  
  
**

As George Santayana once said: "History is always written wrong, it needs always to be rewritten."  

And if it is always rewritten wrongly (just to point out the irony unwittingly embedded, always, in such  
statements) the very purpose would be defeated.  
  
Hence the request to take into consideration the relevant contents of the Puranas, Itihasas and Sthala  
Puranas which go into the body of Bharata-Charitam and Charitram. To the extend possible, Vedanga  
Jyotisham (Astronomy) also may provide some direction to the efforts stated and well intended.  
  
Dhanyo'smi.
