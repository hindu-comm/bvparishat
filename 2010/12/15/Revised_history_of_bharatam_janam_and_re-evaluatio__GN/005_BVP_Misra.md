***Respected scholara, ***

***One of my friends who had worked in the secretariate of Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shashtry, narrated the following incident about a secular political leader who was giving an interview to a few journalists.***

***In course of the talk one of the journalists asked "Do you belive in religion?"***

***The leader replied "I believe in the teachings of the Upanishads."***

***"Which Upanishad do you like most?", was the next question.***

***The leader replied, "I have not read any."***

***The journalist immediately asked, "You believe in some thing that you have not even read?"***

***There was a wave of laughter among those present. The leader was visibly embarassed and hurriedly left the room saying, "Please wait."***

***Many of the journalists did not wait as they were in a hurry to report the incident up to this point.***

***However a few minutes later the leade returned with a book "Teachings of the Upansishads" in English by a Swamiji. It included stories and dialogues from the Upanishads in easy to understand English. However it did not state which story or dialogue had been taken from which Upanishad.***

***Even a few of the journalists who had waited, and had seen the book, did not report about it.***

***With regards,***

***Yours truly,***

***D.D.Misra***
