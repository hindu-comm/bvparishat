The dictionary of Monier-Williams, was published by the East IndiaCompany (Monier- Williams 1899, p.ix). Monier-Williams'inaugural lecture in April 1861 was titled “The study of Sanskrit in relationto missionary work in India” (Monier-Williams 1899, p. x) .
EvangelicalChristendom (1861, Vol. 2, p.465) described Monier-Williams as “a man whoseproclaimed Evangelical orthodoxy formed his stronghold in the recent contestwith so distinguished an antagonist as Max Muller”.I have sourced these references from a posting in an anti-hindu hate group.

  

Sir William Jones is enshrined in a marble panel in the chapel of Oxford College as the father of Hindu law :)-- See image: <https://sites.google.com/site/hindunew/_/rsrc/1249957393023/colonial-legacy/williamjones.jpg>See how the Samskrtam pundits sit at the feet of the said Jones wearing a papal skull-cap.

  

It will be necessary to re-evaluate such missionaries in the robes of scholiasts (who are cited with reverence about remarks on Samskrtam) as we embark on a revised history of Bharatam janam. I hope the dictionary project of Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute gets completely rapidly.
