 Recognizing that these distortions have be removed root and branch, my colleagues and I with the support of several institutions in the U.S. India are launching a project under the title **People's History of India.** It will be a four volume work that goes back to the ending of the Ice Age and brings it all the way to the Age of Globalization, or the present.



I feel it is important to take such a comprehensive look rather than attack and complain piecemeal about individuals like Jones and Max Muller. They were products of their time and had a living to make.



 As George Santayana once said: "History is always written wrong, it needs always to be rewritten."



 We need also to raise questions about historiography-- why history was written the way it was, and why Indians are holding on to versions created by Europeans long after Europe has given it up.



 You will be hearing more about this project.
