AdaraNEya JagannAtha MahOdaya sAdarapraNAmAH,  
  
Thanks for the positive mail. The christian missionary Nobili was a big fraud. He use to call him self as the "Roman Brahman" and tie a cross to yajnOpavEtam and wear it. He had a peculiar idea of converting the Brahmins first and expected an eventual conversion of the rest as the Brahmins are the role models of the Indian society!! Fortunately his plans failed. There are several other such missionaries who picked up Sanskrit and wrote some thing in it and encashed the same for their sole purpose of conversion.
