I think what Max Muller was capable off, a little more than we underestimate him. For instance, he composed a good anushtubh verse, towards the end of the Rgveda in his own edition with his English Introduction, say, something like मोक्षमूलरभट्टेन.......etc. But it is not like पिपीलिका दन्तिवरं प्रसूते.
