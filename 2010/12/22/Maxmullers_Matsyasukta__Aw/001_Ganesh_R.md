Dear Sri. Jagannatha,  
  
I am very happy to read your post which is very curious and has lot of importance in the realm of cultural and Indic studies. It has a greater bearing on exploding the myth of the western scholars' erudition in Sanskrit. I congratulate your sincere and scholarly effort in discovering this interesting piece of writing from the nuggets of age old journals. However I have to say that there is nothing essentially wrong in making a parody of vedic hymns as even master poets like kalidasa and ordinary writers like Harijeevan mishra (17th CE) have employed or mocked the vedic metres and language/style/svara-pattern. Even I have used in several suitable occasions. Coming to your question on Bbavabhuti using the vedic style, I have to say a serious NO to this and I hope you too agree with it.  
  
regards  
  
  
ganesh
