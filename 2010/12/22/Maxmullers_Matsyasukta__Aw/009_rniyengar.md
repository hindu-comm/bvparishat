Dear Sri Jagannatha,  
I enjoyed reading your Matsyasukta attachment and further discussions.  
As you have rightly pointed out Devarata "saw" the mantras and  
muttered them. His scholarly Guru sitting near by was surprised to  
hear Vedic mantras and made a record of them. Now, as Pandit  
Hrishikesha Shastri has indicated Max Mueller only "substituted" some  
words here and there into RV mantras to make a similar one. This topic  
brings to my mind a few questions. a) As is known Zend Avesta is very  
close to RV. In some places the two are like shadows of each other.  
Can we accept Avesta as "seen" and not consciously composed? b)  
Inspiration and intuition are common to poets and artists in all  
countries at all times. But Devarata-chhandodarshana example  
indicates that some type of yogic altered consciousness can bring out  
"Chhandas". Aurobindo also has some such “seen” unpublished writings  
in what he calls "Old Sanskrit" not Vedic. c) Are there any recognized  
examples of Sanskrit Kaavyas of literary merit similarly “seen” but  
not consciously composed?

Regards  
RN Iyengar
