There are many verses in praise of fish eating in Mithila and Bengal  
where it is a favourite dish. This sukta may be a composition of such  
a pandit in name of Maxmuller. I doubt whether Maxmuller was capable  
of writing a poem in sanskrit independently-He depended on others for  
meaning and then twisted them in English to suite his aims of  
destroying Vedic culture.  
I know of only modern Vedic sukas by Maharshi Daivarata of Gokarna  
published as Chhando-sudha by Bharatiya Vidya Bhawan, Mumbai. It  
contains many suktas on Sarasvati in style of Rgveda. Most old poets  
have used Vedic concepts in their writins. Adi Shankaracharya has  
modified many Vedic Rchas in his verses like Veda-sara-Shiva-stavam.  
Madhusudan Ojha in last century had written many such verses combining  
Vedic suktas. Kalidasa was famous for combining 3 meanings of Vedic  
suktas-adhidaivika, adhibhautika, adhyatmika-so his Upamas are  
considered best. Many times it is obvious, e.g.  
अथ नयन समुत्थम् ज्योतिरत्रेरिवद्यौः सुरसरिदिव तेजो वह्नि  
निष्ठ्यूतमैशम्।  
नरपत्कुलभूत्यै गर्भमाधत्त राज्ञी गुरुभिरभिनिविष्टं लोकपालानुभावैः।  
(रघुवंश २/७५)  
In space, creation is by radiation from Sun as eye which mix with Soma  
of Surasari (Akasha-ganga). That mixing is within lunar sphere called  
Atri-jyoto born of Sun-eye. Similarly, in womb of woman, raja-virya  
mix to give birth to a child.  
At other places, it is not obvious. The radiation coming from sun is  
Gau. It is absorbed by earth surface in day time as Agni which is  
Vasu. A part is radiated as Dhenu (infra-red emission) in night.  
Similarly, Nandini as Dhenu was between dark king Dilipa and fair  
queen Sudakshina, as evening is between day-night. Raraja verb  
indicates rise of moon after sunset-it is also called Rajata-pura. Sun  
is Hiraya (gold) pura = Hiranyagarbha , earth is lauha pura. The  
complete event of Raghuvamsha, chapter 32 are parallel to the Rgveda  
(5/6) sukta in some ways.  
पुरस्कृता वर्त्मनि पार्थिवेन प्रत्युद्गता पार्थिव धर्मपत्न्या। तदन्तरे  
सा विरराज धेनुर्दिनक्षपा मध्यगतेव सन्ध्या॥ (रघुवंश २/२०)  
अग्निं तं मन्ये यो वसुरस्तं यं यन्ति धेनवः॥ (ऋग्वेद ५/६/१)  
Scholars may find other parallels-they are abundant in Kalidas-Arun
