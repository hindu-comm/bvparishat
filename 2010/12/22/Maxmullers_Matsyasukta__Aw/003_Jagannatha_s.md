Respected Dr. Shatavadhani R. Ganesh,



Thank you very much for your posting. I am glad to know that you have employed Vedic metres in some of your compositions. Thank you for providing information regarding other attempts of this kind.

Maharshi Daivarata's seeing the Mantras and uttering them are very wellknown(Chandodarshana). One Naval Kishor kankar composed some verses employing Vedic metres in his \`Rashtraveda'. Very recently, Swami Vedabharati (direct discipleof Swami Rama, the famous author of \`Living with Himalayan Masters') has written \`Chaandasii' which is full of \`Vedic' poemswhere the language/diction isof Veda.



I have used some Vedic words in my AbhaaNaka-jagannAtha.



You are correct bydeclaring \`big no' on Bhavabhuti's following Vedic style.The editor of Vidyodaya might have confused on the context of the verse \`amIm vedim......'(Abhijnaana-shaakuntala-4th act).



Here is a portion of an article I read today inWikipedia :



**Roberto De Nobili: Ezourvedam(येसुर्वेदम् ?)**



*Some have alleged that Roberto de Nobili was the author of a forged document written in French and purported to be a translation of an ancient Sanskrit scripture by the name of* [*Ezourvedam*](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ezourvedam&action=edit&redlink=1 "Ezourvedam (page does not exist)")*.* [*Max Mueller*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Mueller "Max Mueller")*, a great Orientalist who edited the series The Sacred Books of the East has concluded convincingly that de Nobili did not author the forged work.Ludo Rocher has published a detailed study about the Ezourvedam which shows that the author of this text must have been a French missionary.*





Thanking you,

S.Jagannatha.
