There is no relationship between fish-eating practice of the people of
either Mithila or West Bengaland Matsya-Sukta. This is not poemof
representing fish-eatinghabit,it is an experiment of employing vedic language and style.The ones who study original works of any language severalyearscan compose poem in that particular language and Vedas are not an exception. MaxMuller did compose stanzas imitating Vedic style and there is no iota of doubt. I fully agree with Sri Narayanan er .

The Mantras \`\`seen'' by Daivarata were collected by his Guru Kavyakantha Ganapatishastrin and commented. The collection is printed bearing the name Chandodarshana(not Chandassudha). For information of other attempts ofemploying Vedic metre/language, please see the postings of Dr. Shatavadhani R.Ganesh and me.
