Respected scholars,



There was a SamskRita journal namely VIDYODAYA, edited by Pandit Hrishikesha shastri. I have seen several issues of it. But unfortunately, the cover pages of all issues are lost except one issue, the year of publication of which is 1900. This journal was being printed at Valmiki press, Kolkata by T.D.Chatterji. Once, while I was turning over the pages of it, all of a sudden, my gaze fell on an article, MatsyasUkta(Pp.150-160)(I could not find the date of the issue in which it was published). This \`\`sUkta'' was written by Maxmuller to make mockery of Vedic sUktas. The editor gives the full text and translation made by Maxmuller himself. Next, he gives his remarks in both SamskRita and English.I do not know where the editor quoted the *sUkta* from. I have typed the whole article AS IT IS. Now I am giving the stuff here for comments of the learned scholars.

 There is a question from my side. Pandit Hrishikesha shastri, the editor, says (paragraph 9)that BhavabhUti follows Vedic style. Is it true?

N.B.The name Vidyodaya is missing in PDF. I am sorry for that.

S.Jagannatha.
