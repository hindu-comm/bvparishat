Congratulations for organizing this grand seminar on this particular theme !



This is for your attention that a major project on the studies of scientific thoughts and components in Vedic literature was undertaken by the School of Vedic Studies of Rabindra Bharati University (56 A, B.T.Road, Kolkata -700050) a few years back where professors attached to different Science disciplines (like Physics and Mathematics), lecturers, research scholars ofVedic studiestook part and contributed substantially.



Researching is still in progress.



Regards,



Soma Basu
