Dear Colleagues,  
  
On behalf of the Conference Organizing Committee, I would like to inform you of the:

Chicago, Illinois  
15-17 February, 2011

The Religion and Spirituality in Society Conference sets out to describe, analyze, and interpret the role of religion and spirituality in society. The bases of this endeavor are cross-disciplinary. The intellectual project is neutral with respect to the agendas of particular religions or explicit counterpoints to religion such as agnosticism oratheism. The Religion and Spirituality in Society Conference serves as a forum for those interested in the pursuit of scholarly conversation surrounding the key issues that impact the relationship between religion and society. The conference is intended as a space for careful, scholarly reflection and open dialogue while recognizing that a tension exists between the academic conversation and the practice of religious and spiritual traditions.  
  
The conference will include presentations by the following plenary speakers:  
  
\* George Bond, Northwestern University, Chicago, USA

\* Steve Shoemaker, host, Keepin' the Faith, Urbana, USA  
\* Robert McKim,University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, USA

Participants are invited to submit a presentation proposal for a 30-minute paper, 60-minute workshop, or a jointly presented 90-minute colloquium session.
