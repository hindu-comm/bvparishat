Thanks for great examples of Vedic sciences including this. Pandit  
Madusudan Ojha has compiled all Vedic references in his book Kadambini-  
published about 90 years ago-available from Rajasthan Patrika, Jaipur.  
Exactly, this quotation is not there, but same matters have been  
discussed.Concluding parts of this quote are remarkable-It explains  
meaning of Vrisha, Vrishabha or Rishabha. Even galaxies are like water  
drops created in infinite space. Its image is human mind which is  
inspired by Vrisha (Purusha, Brahma) which is meant in third pada of  
Gayatri-mantra.
