In [RV 1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RV_1 "RV 1").162.18, the [sacrificial horse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashvamedha "Ashvamedha") is described as having 34 (2x17) ribs:

*The four-and-thirty ribs of the Swift Charger, kin to the Gods, the slayer's hatchet pierces.*

*Cut ye with skill, so that the parts be flawless, and piece by piece declaring them dissect them.* (trans. Griffith)

Frawley (2005) speculates^([\[16\]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_horse_in_South_Asia#cite_note-15)) that the Rigvedic horse could therefore be the Indian [Equus sivalensis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equus_sivalensis "Equus sivalensis") (which may or may not have had 34 ribs; modern horses usually have 36, with occasional specimens of 34 or 38).

  

Frawley, is none other than David Frawley, whose article I had passed to Piyali some years ago. I think he is still living in California.

As this document seems to claim, it is not yet proven that the now extinct Equus Sivalensis has 34 ribs. It also says that todays horses usually have 36 ribs, but there are odd cases of horses coming up with 34 or 38 ribs too. Is that because of past interbreeding of different kinds of horses, or just genetic drift, or what ?

  

If 34 ribs is uncommon, why does the Rg Veda mention it ?

Incidentally, Eqqus Sivalensis lived in the Himalayan foothills in the last ice age, and is presumed to have gone extinct at the end of the ice age, somewhere around 10,000 years ago, or perhaps a bit more recently, but definitely a lot before Max Muller's calendar date of the arrival of the Aryans (1,500 BC).

  

So, can the Rg Veda's horse sacrifice throw any light on the age of its composition, from the horse rib issue ?

  

Lastly, is Griffith's translation of RV 1.162.18 as shown above correct ?
