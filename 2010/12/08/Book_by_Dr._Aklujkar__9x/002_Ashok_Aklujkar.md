The book is yet to be published. It is unlikely to be published at least until the middle of 2011. As the description kindly reproduced by Dr. Joshi suggests, it will be useful to those who do not know Sanskrit especially on the side of identifying features and tendencies of science an/or ;saastra literature in Sanskrit and to those who know Sanskrit especially on the side of bibliography.
