Respected Scholars, Namaste!

Prof Ashok Aklujkar has authored a book:

" Attacking An Amorphous Giant: An Introduction To Science Literature And/Or Sastra Literature in Sanskrit." 2009

Here is brief information.

The situating and mode of expression of the Sanskritic branches of systematic knowledge are unique among classical languages due to several historical and cultural factors. As a consequence, the scientific knowledge and literature in Sanskrit have remained largely inaccessible beyond a small community of specialists. This book seeks to facilitate access for those who have little or no reading knowledge of Sanskrit. It explains the features of the literature and provides a wide-ranging and well-arranged bibliography that enables contemporary readers to move from Western names of sciences to Indic names and from general scholarly literature (surveys, histories, etc.) to specialized scholarly treatments.

I am looking forward to read it. Thanks. N.R.Joshi
