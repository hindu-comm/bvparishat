Surprisingly, such tragedies come when there is need to divert public  
attention from massive corruption which continues British scheme of  
taking all money of India to foreign banks. This had to be delayed by  
1 day after 6 December as French deal over atomic reactor was to be  
forgotten. That was during Arati for which Vedic Mantra is quoted  
below-  
धूरसि धूर्वं धूर्वन्तं धूर्वं तं योऽस्मान्धूर्वति तं धूर्वं यं वयं  
धूर्वामः। (वाजसनेयी यजुर्वेद १/८)  
This is request to Agni (present in Dipa)-O Agni, you are Dhu (who  
smashes, burns). Please burn those who are burning and destroying us.
