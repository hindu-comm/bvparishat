### VHP demands ban on entry of non-Hindus into Kashi

PTI / Tuesday, December 7, 2010 23:07 IST

Dubbing the explosion in Varanasi as "a heinous act of jihadi terrorism", Vishwa Hindu Parishad today demanded the holy city of Kashi be accorded the status of a "protected heritage site" and entry of non-Hindus into it be banned.

"It is the second time that a heinous act of jihadi terrorism has been committed at the holy city of Varanasi on a Tuesday, a day held sacred by millions of Hindus.

"It was a Tuesday when the Sankatmochan temple was rocked by a bomb explosion and now there is a blast at a spot where the Ganga arati was underway", VHP international secretary general Praveen Togadia said in a statement.

He said the government, which has been "defaming Hindus by coining phrases like Hindu terrorism", "must now show the courage to act tough and conduct a thorough search of the numerous mosques where jehadi elements have been taking shelter".

"What business do non-Hindus have at the ghats of Kashi and other places held sacred by the Hindus? When Hindus are not allowed inside Haj houses and mosques, why are people from other faiths allowed to roam freely around temples. All this has been allowed so far on account of the policy of Muslim appeasement adopted by the government", the firebrand VHP leader said.

"The Vishwa Hindu Parishad demands that all the madrasas located at Kashi be immediately locked and premises of the mosques situated there be searched thoroughly.

"Besides, Kashi must be declared a protected heritage site and the entry of non-Hindus in the area should be prohibited", he said.

# Terror strikes Varanasi: 1 dead, 35 hurt in blast at ghat

Binay Singh & Rajeev Dikshit, TNN, Dec 8, 2010, 12.29am IST

  
VARANASI: A 10-month seeming lull after the Pune[German Bakery blast](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/search?q=German%20Bakery%20blast)was shattered on Tuesday when terror returned with a low-grade explosion at the evening[Ganga Aarti](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/search?q=Ganga%20Aarti)in Varanasi that left a one-year-old girl, Swastika Sharma, dead and 35 injured, including four foreigners.  
  
The crude device went off at 6.40pm at the old[Dasaswamedh Ghat](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/search?q=Dasaswamedh%20Ghat)just as the aarti had begun. Mercifully the crowd was thin for the popular aarti on Tuesday as the city was already under red alert because of the[Babri Masjid](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Babri-Masjid)demolition anniversary a day earlier.  
  
The[Indian Mujahideen](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/search?q=Indian%20Mujahideen)has claimed responsibility for the blast in an email sent from close to Link Road in west Malad in[Mumbai](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Mumbai). The group has said the attack was to "avenge" the Babri demolition. It also has attacked the Allahabad high court verdict on the Babri dispute.  
  
Intelligence agencies were verifying the IM claim. Unlike on previous occasions, there was a 30-minute gap between the blast and the email.[Intel](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Intel)sources said the low-intensity blast possibly indicated the desire on the terror group's part to earn propaganda points rather than inflict mass casualties.  
  
An Italian tourist Alexender Monkerly was badly injured in the blast and his condition is said to be critical.
