Dear Nagaraj:



 I am very glad you arranged this program:



 **Ayodhya Verdict-- A historian's perspective.**



** Dr. Koenraad Elst**



** The Bangalore Mythic Society**

**Wednesday, 15 December at 6:30 PM**



**** He is the best qualified person to speak on it. He is a good friend (and colleague) of mine and I will be happy to say a few words about him and his work.



 Please be aware that he has a serious heart condition, having undergone a heart transplant operation. Every consideration should be shown with regard to lodgings, food and travel.



 I will be there a bit early.



Sincere regards,

N.S. Rajaram



**For Balramji:** I cannot think of a better person than Koenraad for the Harvard program on Ayodhya that we had been talking about.



**For Sreenath:** Please give this the widest circulation.
