Dear Giri:



 Thank you very much for the effort. I have made more progress and I think I can derive a version of Bell's theorem from Vedanta, which I may present at the International Vedanta Symposium at Dartmouth in July 2011.



 We will need to start working on getting a few key speakers for it. I feel that Lee Smolin and David Peat would be valuable as well as E.C.G. Sudarshan of Texas. All three are distinguished scientists with a philosophical orientation. There is of course no shortage of physicists in the new England area, but we must remember the Conference topic is philosophy of science, especially Vedanta. It should not be turned into a physics conference.



We can start contacting them as soon as the holidays are over. Could you please send me the email id of Vidya Ramanathan?



 Thank you again for your great interest and untiring efforts.



Best regards and happy holidays to you and your family,

N.S. Rajaram
