To all scholars,  
  
New Year greetings are pouring in from all sides in the last couple of days from this group. Wishes, no doubt, are welcome on an occasion like the one obtains to-night.  
  
I don't want to sound cynical here lest earn the wrath of scholars such as yours. I think we are too eager in assimilating what is not our own. Over the last 6 decades, we have been told to believe all that belongs to our ancient heritage is “un-civilized” and worth eschewing it once for all. One such is example is 3000 years we add to the 2010 to tell the whole world that India goes back much in antiquity in history than the so-called modern one which has no trace of civilization, what-so-ever, beyond this limit of 2000 years. We are forced to believe that SUN started shedding his light on humanity since 2000 years only. Anything earlier to this date is a “dark chapter” and “worthless”. Bharatiya Vidvat Parishat should ponder over this and its members should strive to “protect and propagate” our OWN-NESS. Please do not consider me as a black sheep in the group. This is just a food for thought. Constructive criticisms are welcome.  
  
  
Thanks and regards,
