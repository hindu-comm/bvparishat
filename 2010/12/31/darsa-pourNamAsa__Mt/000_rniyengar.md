Dear Members:  
I have a question about the Dars'a-pourNamAsa IshTi. Are there any  
Ahutis (oblations) offered in the DP Vedi directly? Is there any Agni  
in the DP-Vedi? This doubt is because in the Shrouta prayoga books  
that I have seen most of the offerings are indicated to be done in the  
Ahavaniya or the DakshiNAgni. It is possible I might not have  
understood the cryptic statements correctly. I would be thankful for  
clarifications.  
  
RN Iyengar
