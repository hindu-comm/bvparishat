We should take a generalized view of Yajna in explaining its cycle of  
creation in stead of minute details of procedure . Darsha is least  
bright stage of sun and Purnamasa is fully bright. Rising phase is  
from darsha to Purnamasa, then follows the declining phase from  
Purnamasa to Darsha. Only then, we can understand various yajnas  
called Jnana, Dravya, tapoyajna, Prana-yajna, Pranayama-yajna etc.  
Carnot cycle of Thermodynamics is a similar cycle from compression to  
expansion with iso-thermal and adiabatic stages. Zemansky has  
explained its various parallels in his 'Heat & Thermodynamics'. Gita  
(3/11-16) gives 7 phases of yajna cycle-Arun
