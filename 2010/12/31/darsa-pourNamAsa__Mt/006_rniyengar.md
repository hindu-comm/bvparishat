Dear Scholars,  
My question was about Fire on the DP-Vedi and not in the DP-ritual. I  
have come to the conclusion that there is no fire on the DP-vedi aka  
Antarvedi.  
There was a meeting organized by TIFR at Bombay on Archaeoastronomy. I  
made a brief presentation on the astronomy behind the Dars’a-  
pūrnamāsa altar or the Antarvedi that is situated between the  
Gārhapatya and the Ahavanīya Fires. Some leading astronomers,  
physicists, archaeologists and Sanskrit scholars were present in the  
select audience. The talk was well received even though I cannot say  
that everyone was happy with my work. Those interested in “Vedic  
Astronomy/Science” may go through my presentation available at  
  
<http://www.scribd.com/doc/49133364/Vedic-astronomy-behind-the-darsha-purnamasa-altar>  
  
Please note the above is only a slide presentation. I am yet to write  
up my findings in the form of a paper. During the talk I provided  
several clarifications to the slides. These are missing in the above  
file, but the main line of reasoning would be still clear.  
  
Regards  
  
RN Iyengar
