I may be excused for the posting --  
I was to Inaugurate a VakyArthasabha of Faculty at Sri SankaracArya  
University , Kaladi , Kerala and the topic I selected was  
"MahAvAkyArtha' ( in all Darsanas) . Towards the end a sinior scholar  
remarked -- it should be 'ko rA.t ?' (who is the king) then the answer  
is 'subra..' .  
There was VAkovAkyam (a treatise in the form of question and answer)  
refered to by Patanjali in Paspas'A . Here the surname and name are  
taken as a MahAvAkyam .

In sixteen languages ( including Nepalese and Simhalese)'korada' means  
'a stick / lathi / shaft' .
