Under 'svaritenAdhikAra.h' (PA.nini1-3-11), Patanjali discusses the  
meaning of 'adhikAra' -

1\. PA.nini , in order to achieve maximum brevity , introduced  
AdhikArasUtras , which do/can not denote any complete sense at the  
place they are uttered , but run into VidhisUtras and help in arriving  
at the complete VAkyArtha (in fact, MahAvAkyArtha) .

2\. Patanjali draws analogy between the technical meaning that is  
assigned here in VyAkara.nam and the one available in 'Loka' --  
kim gtamiyatA sUtre.na ? gatamityaha , kuta.h ? lokata.h , tadyathA  
loke - adhik.rto'sau grAme , adhik.rto'sau nagare ityucyate yo yatra  
vyApAram gacchati .

3.svaritenAdhikAragatiryathA vijnAyate -- adhikam kAryam, adhika.h kAra.h

In PUrvamImAmsA there is a niyama -- dampatyo.h sahAdhikArAt . Here  
it is eligibility,  
i.e. neither bhartA nor bhAryA has got the eligibility to perform any  
rite . It is like 'vyAsajyav.rtti' (that is spread across both but not  
in either) .

Now the term 'adhikAry' is easily understood - one who has got  
soemthing extra to do .

such terms have to be interpreted depending on the 'Prakara.nam'  
(context) but the shade of meaning will be there .
