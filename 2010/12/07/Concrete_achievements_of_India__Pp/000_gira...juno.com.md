Respected Scholars, Namaskar!

I have no intention of hurting feelings of readers of this list. If I did, I apologize. I make sure that I will stay away in future from presenting such views here.

One point I would like to make. All the past achievements of the ancient India are based on concrete, practical , scientific thinking- such as

\(1\) smelting of iron ore and development of special steel,

\(2\) Numbers,zero and decimal system

\(3\) Algebra, Trigonometry, and calculus

\(4\) Ayurveda based on observation, investigation of medicinal properties of plants

\(5\) All Sanskrit grammatical works.

\(6\) Nature and properties of sound and their application to phonetics of Sanskrit letters.

\(7\) Some knowledge of Electricity and Magnetism

There are many more achievements.

So I would like to stress the point- instead of bringing mysterious elements in discussions, one should try to proceed thinking in scientific way in all walks of life so that all become happy and comfortable to enjoy life. Modern India is on the path of rapid developments. If directedtowards systematic way, all will become happy.Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
