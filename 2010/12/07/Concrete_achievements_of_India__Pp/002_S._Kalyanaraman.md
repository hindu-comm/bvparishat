dhanyavaadaah, Pathak ji.

  

Congratulations on the intl. seminar on science and technologhy in ancient indian texts. I hope the presentations will be published on a website. Such a publication will be an effective way to involve the youth in such studies. Bharatam today is the youngest nation on the globe with 70% of the population less than 35 years of age.
