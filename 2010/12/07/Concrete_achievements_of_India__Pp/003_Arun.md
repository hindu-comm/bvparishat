Sri Ramakrishna Sharma has accurately quoted source of all sciences.  
It is described in varied details at many places. I have compiled them  
under chapter 4 Dhi-yoga of my book Gayatri-Panchadashi (Hindi) on  
website scribd/Arunupadhyay. I do not see any reason why persons  
should learn science from a person who has himself no idea of that or  
learn sanskrit from a person who has not seen any original text and  
waits for whole life to know meaning of a single word from white  
sahebs.  
Methods of knowledge have been classified in 2 ways in Gita etc-Jnana  
and Vijnana. Source of science is no mystery, or Janardana himself is  
source of all mysteries-  
(1) We assume that rules of science are same for all places, times and  
situations without any verification-otherwise there can be no  
scientific theory. Meanings of words are same for all persons  
otherwise there will be no language. These are from Janardana. Without  
basic unity of thought (Vidya), there is no knowledge. So, Mundaka  
upanishad verse 1 tells that Brahma-vidya is foundation (Pratishtha)  
of all knowledge.  
(2) There is classification in 2, 3,4 ,5 7, 9 and 11 parts as  
described in Bhagavata purana (11/19/14-15).  
(3) All theories of linguistcs in British era were just designed to  
show inferiority of sanskrit and Bharata and they have no idea of any  
word or language. Meanings of words have 4 fold source as Chatushpada  
Brahma (Shabda Brahma and Para-Brahma)and variations as per 7  
samsthas. Words related to ocean would be in Karnataka or Orissa, why  
it should be searched in Haryana or Bihar? Word of railways are not  
used in shipping. Medical terms are not used in engineering etc. There  
are specialities due to historical and geographical reasons and  
structure of Varna-akshara-shabda-pada-vakya. But linguists prefer to  
remain blind in devotion to Maxmuller-why that devotion is not  
considered mysterious?  
(4) People assume that iron and copper were just obtained from God and  
used. How it can be used as a metal without locating the mines, actual  
mining, refining, metallurgy and foundry-forging? All these require  
science. More complicated is prospecting and metallurgy of copper-it  
is considered primitive by still more primitive researchers.  
(5) I recall a remark by Dipak Bhattacharya about 5 days ago that  
Vedic era started in 1500 BC. He is all against use of any astronomy  
in vedic interpretation. Where from this date has come and in what  
calender system it was indicated? If one just sees the cover pages, he  
will know that last 40th chapter of Yajurveda is Ishavasyopanishad.  
How has he classified upanishad era as different? What was method of  
calculation? Pretensions of Vedic research are blind devotion to  
Maxmuller only who is mysterious God for them.  
(6) Geographical references in Puranas, Mahabharata are based on  
assumption that location and size of all these areas were known. Can a  
map of world be made without knowledge of trigonometry or without  
actually visiting the places? But 'researchers' assume that these were  
given by their God and has no logical basis.
