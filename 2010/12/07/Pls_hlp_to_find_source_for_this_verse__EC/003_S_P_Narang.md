Patanjali has created a number of verses related to grammar on the basis of his own observations with clue from other Acaryas. Creative poetry is also not missing. Grammatico-poetry is also available: stosyaamyaham raavaNamaudavaahim which might have inspired poets like Bhatti.A number of scholars and critics had been writing similar verses. A hint is in Bhamaha's Kavyalankara--- saalaaturiiyametadanukrameNa and vyaakhyaagamyamidam kaavyam....which is directly related to Bhatti. etc.
I think the verse is that of Patanjali for vyatyayo bahulam who has tried to enumerate the grammatical fields for its application. Regards, spnarang
