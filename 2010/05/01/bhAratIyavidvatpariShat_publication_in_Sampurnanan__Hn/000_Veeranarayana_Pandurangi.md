VARANASI: With the exposure of a publication scam of over Rs 10.40 crore, the Executive Council of Sampurnanand Sanskrit University (SSU) has recommended the matter to the state government for engaging some competent agency for a probe.  
  
The EC of SSU met under the chairmanship of vice-chancellor Prof V Kutumb Shashtri on Friday. Out of the 17 members, 11 remained present at the meeting. After the meeting, registrar Gangdhar Panda told TOI over phone that on April 5, a meeting of finance committee of varsity had taken place. During the same meeting it had come to light that the state government had released a fund of over Rs 1 crore per year from 2000-01 to 2009-10 sessions to the publication division of SSU for publishing manuscripts.  
  
"However, during the initial investigation, the committee found that the publication division did not publish a single manuscript," said Panda. The division was headed by Harishchandra Mani, who passed away last year. Following the detection of large-scale financial irregularity, the finance committee recommended the matter to the EC for necessary action. Taking a serious note of the scam, the council decided to forward the matter to the state government for a high-level probe, added Panda.
