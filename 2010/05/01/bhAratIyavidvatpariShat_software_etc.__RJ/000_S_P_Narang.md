respected scholars, I want to know about some software/programme which can classify huge material on Kalidasa in different fonts, styles, initialsand different files from handwritten files and from Internets, libraries both primary and secondary sources. Your help shall save my huge amount of my life to finish the project. I have a tried a number of devices with less output. Regards to all particularly computer-science technicians and Pandits. spnarang
