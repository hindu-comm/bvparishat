A few observations regarding the relationship between  
Devanagari(script) and Samskrita(language).  
  
1.There is a statement in your article: ‘‘Tamil is shortened by  
merging initial 4 letters in each group of Sanskrit consonants'' Tamil  
has first and fifth letters of all group consonants of Samskrta.  
Tamil lacks second, third and fourth letters of group consonants of  
Samskrita. But it is not drawback. Why because, Tamilians DO pronounce  
the other letters while speaking if there is necessity. But they don't  
have phonetic symbols to write them, that's all. But it does create  
great difficulty in writing Samskrta. In order to tackle this problem,  
the scholars from Tamilunadu created a unique script and they called  
it Grantha script. Here Grantha means Samskrta Grantha.Even though in  
some patterns, it looks like Tamil script, it is totally unique and  
the ones who don't know Samskrta(in spite of knowledge of Tamilu)can  
not read it properly.  
2.Samskrta can be written in all Indian scripts ( of course, with the  
exception of Tamilu)and even in some of the non Indian scripts like  
Bhota(Tibetan), Newari, Khmer(Thai) and Simhali(Srilanka).Recently a  
scholar from Japan, who visited ORI Mysore, informed me that Samskrta  
can be written even in Korean script.  
3.All the Northern Indian scripts namely Sharada, Kutila, Ranjana, Old  
Devanagari,Gujarathi, Odia, Gaudi, Bengali, Gurumukhi and Maithili are  
derived from Northern version of Brahmi.  
4.Samskrta works in Gurumukhi are extremely rare. It is mainly used  
for writing Punjabi language.  
5.All the Southern Indian scripts namely Grantha, Tamilu, Kannada,  
Nandinaagari, Telugu, Tigalaari and Malayaalam are derived from  
southern version of Brahmi.  
6.Even some of the non-Indian scripts namely Bhota(Tibetan),Sharada,  
Newari and Simhali are derived from Brahmi.  
7.Samskrta was written in nearly thirty scipts! There is no script  
which is the ONLY script for writing Samskrta. There is NO script, the  
name of which is SAMSKRTA-SCRIPT.Samskrta is language and not script.  
8. All the scripts used for writing Samskrita belong to Samskrita!  
Human beings have twenty fingers and all the fingers belong to them!  
9.Even today hundreds of Samskrta works are printed in the scripts  
other than Devanagari. One does not insult Samskrta by writing it in  
the scripts other than Devanagari.For example,I myself use Kannada  
scipt while writing Samskrta.  
10.Now a days scholars are using chiefly Devanagari for writing  
Samskrta. When the letter presses were got started in our country,  
they were using the scripts specific to the area in which they were  
established. Devanagari was limited to Mumbai and some parts of  
Uttarapradesh. Kannada (in Karnataka), Telugu (in Andhrapradesh)  
Malayalam (in Kerala), Grantha (in Tamilunadu)- these were the scripts  
used in southern India in the letter presses.But what was happened  
is, the most influencial presses like Nirnayasaagara would use quality  
paper for printing Samskrta texts with very attractive get up.  
Compared to Nirnayasaagaraa publications, Samskrita works printed in  
the presses like Vidyamudraakshara-shaalaa(Kannada,)Vaavilla  
Ramasvamulu and sons(Telugu)were inferior in quality. No font was  
having varities of bold, italics and the like.So gradually, the  
scholars were attracted to beautiful editions of the presses like  
Nirnayasagar press, Mumbai.In the course of time, Devanagari got  
started to emerge as widely used script for writing Samskrta.  
11.The correct meaning of the word Devanaagari is disputed.In my view,  
Deva is short form of Mahaadeva. Mahaadeva means God Shiva.According  
to the popular belief, Mahaadeva(Lord Shiva)dwells in Varanasi. So,the  
script prevailing in and around Varanasi is called Devanaagari.  
12.There is another opinion regarding the word derivation of the word  
Devanagari. There was a king namely Skandagupta who had the title  
DEVA. He ruled over NAGARAKHANDA. The script, which was in vogue in  
Nagarakhanda ruled by the king who had the title Deva is called  
Devanagari. This information is from an article published in MANIHA.  
13.I do not know how is the word Devanaagarii correct according to  
the strict Paniniyan grammar.  
14.According to Panini's Pratyaahaarasuutras, Samskrta has fourty-two  
letters; neither less, nor more. In Paniniya Shiksha it is said that  
the total letters are 63 or 64. This calculation is based on the  
pronunciation peculiarities and varieties like Niranunaasika,  
Saanunaasika, Udaatta, Anudaatta etc..
