Thanks for the additional information, Dr. Jagannatha.

\>1. The relationship between Nagarakhanda and Devanagari is suggested

  
\> by Dr.R. Sheshashastri in MANIHA( A collection of Kannada articles  
\> regarding Manuscriptology.Pub by B.M.Shri smaraka pratishthaana,  
\> Bangalore 1972).\<

Is there any textual/documentary evidence cited in this article? If there is, will you kindly reproduce it in the interest of a more informed discussion? What does Nagarakhanda stand for? If it is a geographical designation, as seems to be the case, where is/was the area it referred to? Was it extensive or influential enough to be recognized in the name of a script? Why was the khanda part dropped -- why not Nagarakhandi or Naagarakhandi on the pattern of Bundel --> Bundel(a)khandi? The responsibility to answer some of these questions is, of course, not yours but of those propose the particular historical explanation. However, any questions you can answer will make the discussion more rewarding.

\> 2.NAGARAANAAM IYAM NAAGARII is well known. But for the word  
\> Devanaagari, resorting to grammatical circus is inevitable. After  
\> NAGARAANAAM IYAM NAAGARII we have to derive the word by  
\> DEVASYA(DEVAANAAM ?) NAAGARII and the meaning will become uncertain.  
\> If the original word is DEVANAGARA, the secondary form will be  
\> DAIVANAGARII because of unavoidable AADIVRDDHI.

Pl revisit the wording, especially ""two stages," in my earlier post. It is not necessary that we should take the compound deva-nagara as our starting point for the derivation of the name Devanaagarii. We are free to leave open the possibility that naagarii (having the required aadi-v.rddhi) could have come into existence first and then deva would have been prefixed to it for the sake of perspicuity. That such indeed is more likely to have been the case is indicated by at least two facts: (a) There are varieties of what we call naagarii script as the fairly old attestations like Nandi-naagarii and probably modern usages like Gupta-naagarii and Jaina-naagarii indicate; a need to identify a particular variety must have gradually emerged. (b) The form 'naagarii" was used outside the domain of scripts, for example, in architecture.

The question of why deva was chosen as a qualifier, of course, remains, and until we get clearer textual evidence, the best we can do is simply to note the various possibilities. The semantic history of Devanaagarii may be unclear, but its derivation as a morpheme need not be a problem for Paa.ninian grammar.

Possible.

I am glad that such is the case and wish that printing Skt in scripts other than Devanagari will again be taken up in India. It is my impression that several Skt texts were first published in South Indian scripts and then simply copied into Devanagari without going back to the manuscripts. These first editions and the early independently (= directly from manuscripts) produced South Indian editions are of historical interest. It has become very difficult to gain access to them. Libraries should publish separate lists of them if they have any in their holdings. Individuals and organizations should preserve them for posterity through high-quality photographing and circulate them.

\> 7. Devanaagari might be used in vast area. But definitely its wider

\> Northern parts like Orissa and Bengal caused by the good Devanagari  
\> letter presses of last century.

As I wrote in my earlier post, there is some historical truth in this. However, the preference showed by the East India Company for Devanagari was also a significant factor. It does not seem likely that the Company simply made an arbitrary decision. It probably saw it as a practically wise decision. Again, I invite you and other interested list members to read the not-so-old discussion on the Indology-Liverpool list.
