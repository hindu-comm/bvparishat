Thank you Dr. Ashok Aklujkar for informative response.  
Now I would like to add something to my privious comment.  
  
1.The relationship between Nagarakhanda and Devanagari is suggested  
by Dr.R. Sheshashastri in MANIHA( A collection of Kannada articles  
regarding Manuscriptology.Pub by B.M.Shri smaraka pratishthaana,  
Bangalore 1972).  
2.NAGARAANAAM IYAM NAAGARII is well known. But for the word  
Devanaagari, resorting to grammatical circus is inevitable. After  
NAGARAANAAM IYAM NAAGARII we have to derive the word by  
DEVASYA(DEVAANAAM ?) NAAGARII and the meaning will become uncertain.  
If the original word is DEVANAGARA, the secondary form will be  
DAIVANAGARII because of unavoidable AADIVRDDHI.  
3.In the manuscripts of SOUTHERN INDIA, I have not come across any  
PALM LEAF manuscript of Samskrta that has Devanaagari script. The  
scripts I have noticed there are southern Indian scripts. I think the  
first entrance of Devanagari in Karnataka took place some 200 years  
ago when Mummadi Krishnaraja Wodeyar started to experiment with  
lithographic printing. He got his own works (written in Kannada and  
Samskrita)printed in lithography chiefly utilizing Kannada script. His  
encyclopedic work SHREETATTVANIDHI was printed in lithography using  
Kannada script. Very rarely one may notice even Devanaagari in his  
works of lithographic print . But DEVANAAGARI DID NOT BECOME POPULAR  
in Karnataka in his period. Scholars were preferring Kannada script in  
copying and printing Samskrita works. In some parts of Karnataka  
(particularly in southern side of Karnataka) a special script namely  
TIGALAARI was used for writing.(This Tigalaari is forerunner of  
Malayalam) In some other parts, TELUGU and Nandinaagari.  
4. Bengal has the script Bengali and Orissa has the script Odia for  
writing Samskrita.  
5.The famous Shabdakalpadruma of Radhakantadeva was first printed in  
Bengali script! The Devanagari edition we are seeing now is of second  
version!  
6.Once a scholar from Orissa was attending a workshop on  
Manuscriptology conducted by NMM, New Delhi. When I dictated some  
Samskrita verses, he immediately took down the verses in Odia script  
and not Devanagari(in spite of his knowing Devanaagari)! I have  
already informed that I myself use Kannada script while writing  
Samskrita.This kind of writing Samskrita in non-devanagari is still  
continuing.No other language in this world has such a wide variety of  
scripts for writing.This matter shall enter into Guinness book of  
world record!  
7. Devanaagari might be used in vast area. But definitely its wider  
usage in both writing and print in Southern India as well some  
Northern parts like Orissa and Bengal caused by the good Devanagari  
letter presses of last century.
