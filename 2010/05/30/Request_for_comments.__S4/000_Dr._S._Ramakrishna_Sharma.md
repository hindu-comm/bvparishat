हरि: ॐ  
नमस्ते।  
One of the esteemed members of our Group(Foundation for Indian Scientific Heritage), Sri Arun Kumar Upadhyay  
has posted a file on Narasimha Avatara. It is very interesting. Just a sample paragraph  
is copied below.  
"At time of Narasimha, Braahmi script was used in India. The world order was set by  
earlier Brahmi at Puskara (120 west of Ujjain and 350 north-Bukhara in Uzbekistan). West  
(left) part from that place wrote towards left, east part India from left to right and north east(China, Japan) from top to bottom. This system still continues. Brahmi of 64 letters continues only in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. After supremacy of Indra, he started Devanagari  
with help of Marut (north west part is marut direction). So, Devan¢gar¤ is used only in north  
India and Orissa. Its consonants from ka to ha-are symbols of 33 devas. The script is a nagara  
(city) of devas in symbols, so it is devanagari. As Indra started this, he was called Lekharsabha.  
Alekha name is used in Orissa only. Karttikeya further shortened it to Tamil."
