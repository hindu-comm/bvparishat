there is ample evidence to differ from Dr. Jagannatha.

Karnataka if taken wholly in present geographical sense, had devanagari MS forat least four centuries at least in the northern (our) part of Karnataka. I have not seen any MS of Dviata works in kannada scripts in my own ancestoral collections as well as others (in mathas, and other libraries.) Even the Sarasavati Mahal library hasmany DevNa sript MSs atleast four centuries old.



more over Devnagari may have something against the Nandinagari. we have to think.
