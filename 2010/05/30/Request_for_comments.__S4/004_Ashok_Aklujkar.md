Dr. S. Jagannatha has made several valid comments and offered much useful information.

\>the most influential presses like Nirnayasaagara would use quality

  
\> paper for printing Samskrta texts with very attractive get up.  
\> Compared to Nirnayasaagaraa publications, Samskrita works printed in  
\> the presses like Vidyamudraakshara-shaalaa(Kannada,)Vaavilla  
\> Ramasvamulu and sons(Telugu)were inferior in quality. No font was  
\> having varities of bold, italics and the like.So gradually, the  
\> scholars were attracted to beautiful editions of the presses like  
\> Nirnayasagar press, Mumbai.In the course of time, Devanagari got  
\> started to emerge as widely used script for writing Samskrta.

This definitely has some historical truth in it. However, it should also be borne in mind that Devanagari was used over a wide area for centuries before printing came to India. See the discussion that took place on the Indology-Liverpool list a few months ago and is preserved in the archive of that list (freely accessible as far as I know).

\> \>The correct meaning of the word Devanaagari is disputed.In my view,  
\> Deva is short form of Mahaadeva. Mahaadeva means God Shiva.According  
\> to the popular belief, Mahaadeva(Lord Shiva)dwells in Varanasi. So,the  

\> script prevailing in and around Varanasi is called Devanaagari. ... another opinion ... There was a king namely Skandagupta who had the title

  
\> DEVA. He ruled over NAGARAKHANDA. The script, which was in vogue in  
\> Nagarakhanda ruled by the king who had the title Deva is called  
\> Devanagari. This information is from an article published in MANIHA.  
\> 13.I do not know how is the word Devanaagarii correct according to  
\> the strict Paniniyan grammar.\<

If there is explicit documentary evidence in favour of the proposed connections, they should be seriously entertained. As I recall, another possibility was suggested in an old article by the Hindi scholar Dhirendra Varma. The words Naagarii and Draavi.dii are used for styles in architecture. The former is dominated by staight lines, the latter by curves. One can make an analogous generalization about the Naagarii script and the scripts commonly used for Dravidian languages. This explanation would, however, not work if the architectural styles were named after the peculiarities of the scripts.

The above-mentioned use in architectural texts, as well as the script name Nandi-naagarii, suggests, that the derivation of the name Devanaagarii should be done in two stages. The stem naagarii should be derived first and deva should be added to it as a qualifier -- to exclude other entities referable by the word naagarii. It is not difficult to derive naagarii from nagara in Paa.ninian grammar.
