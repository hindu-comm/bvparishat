मान्याः,  
Thanks for the thought associated with the evolution of scripts.In various ways the scholars have so far tried to find the genesis of writing,but nothing much concrete has come out except brilliant guesses.  
The word 'Devanaagarii' has 33 consonants and has the constituent part 'deva' therein.If its linked up with the gods then what about the vowels ?It may be just coincidental.The stronger view puts the whole alphabets structure as a product of Maheshvara's musical instrument.So language is Maaheshvara or Aindra is a big question.Indra is said to be a student of Brihaspati for study of Vyaakarana.  
And to assign a date to Narasimha will be difficult.If naarasimha is historical we have to have proof for it.The Amarakosha has the word 'Lekharshabha' as one of the names of Indra,but can this mention be stretched so far is another question.Rishabha is also said to have spread the use of Braahmii script which was named after his daughter.Its also ascribed to Brahmaa and so on.  
About Devanaagarii in Odisha,its not a fact.May be the Odia script developed out of Braahmii or a descendant of it,which could be Devanaagarii too.Devanaagarii is earlier than Odia script and the latter bears lots of similarity with the former except particularly the horizontal line 'shiirsharekhaa' above which due to the use of palm leaf for writing,was replaced by a spherical top considered to be an integral part of the letters unlike the same in Devanaagarii.Without shirorekhaa you can write Devanaagarii but not so in Odia.Historically Devanaagarii was not prevalent in Odisha in it's three earlier often overlapping parts called Utkala,ODra and Kalinga.Rarely do we come across a palm leaf manuscript written in Devanaagarii script.  
But the Devanaagarii is the best script so far for Sanskrit writing.May be it was developed for the same in the classical period.Braahmii as we see it in the edicts of Ashoka is not complete in alphabets required for Sanskrit,hence some additions were brought in later.  
With warm regards,
