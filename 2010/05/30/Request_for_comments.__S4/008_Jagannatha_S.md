In ORI Mysore I have seen Nandinagari in Palmleaf manuscripts and not  
Devanagari. This Nandinagari is used even in inscriptions. Mostly it  
is used for Samskrta. But interestingly (rarely) it is used for  
writing even Kannada! In our library I have seen Devanagari in  
lithographic print and letter-press-print and not palm leaf  
manuscripts. I thought that Dvaita philosophical works in palm leaf  
works are in either Tigalari or Nandinagari and not Devanagari. I  
thank Dr.Veeranarayana Pandurangi for enhancing my knowledge by  
informing that even Devanagari (not Nandinagari) manuscripts having  
Dvaita philosophical works in Palm leaf are available aplenty in  
Saraswathi Mahal library.  
  
I am grateful to you, Dr.Ashok Aklujkar for providing me more facts.  
At present I don't have MANIHA.Could you please allow me ten days and  
I will give you more details regarding the said article.
