Respected scholars!  
‘‘Ankaanaam vaamato gatih’’  
This statement is well known.  
Questions:  
1.In the numbers like ‘pancha vimshati’, the vimshati is first  
taken into consideration and next pancha. So the statement shall be  
‘‘ankaanaam dakshinato gatih’’. Why it is said that movement of the  
ankas is from left?  
2.Most crucial thing is why the direction is changed? In shastras,  
why the number shown as 347 (by number denoting words like vahni-veda-  
vaasara) when the intended number is 743(vaasara-veda-vahni)? After  
we read 347 we utter ‘‘ankaanaam vaamato gatih’’ and start ‘ankaanaam  
dakshiNato gati’’ and take the value of the number 347 as 743! The  
shastrakaras could have written 743 and meant seven hundred and Forty  
three, that’s all. What special purpose is served by reversing the  
order?  
3.‘Vaama’ is also meant opposite. As ‘‘vaamaah kulasyaadhayah’’ in  
Abhijnaanashaakuntala. Can we take the word ‘vaama’ in the sense of  
opposite direction? In spite of taking the same, the two questions  
remain unsettled: 1.Why the order is reverse? 2. While the movement is  
from right, why we say ‘the movement is from left’?
