(UK)Translated (View Original) Dear Colleague, अङ्कानां वामतो गतिः

  
clearly refers to the statement of numbers through symbols like  
चन्द्र,पक्ष, नेत्र, वेद etc. In such statements the unit is first  
stated, then the tenth place digit, then the hudredth place digit and  
so on. 314 will be वेद-चन्द्र=नेत्र। The inherited words for numbers  
too follow this order. त्रयोविंशति means three-twenty where the unit-  
number is first stated. For the tenth place number one utters it after  
multiplying by ten. So त्रयोविंशति noit त्रयोद्वि। Obviously stating  
through symbols is an old practice that followed the order of numbers  
in representative words. On the other hand, while writing one follows  
the reverse order. One writes the highest place digit first, then the  
next lower and so on. So for three hundred and fourteen we write the  
hundreth place digit first, then the tenth place and finally the unit.  
When one sees through this angle of writing the uttered numbers appear  
in reversed order. This should be the source of the proverb अङ्कानां

Respected Sri Dipak Bhattacharya!

I have not understood your first sentence,  
‘‘अङ्कानां वामतो गतिः clearly refers to the statement of numbers  
through symbols like चन्द्र,पक्ष, नेत्र, वेद etc.’’  
How does the adage ‘ankaanaam vaamato gatih’ clearly refer number-  
denoting words? Can you please explain?  
S.Jagannatha.
