\>I remember: ayuraarogyasaukhyam indicate to a particular date.  
  

That is true.आयुरारोग्यसौख्यं is the last compound word of the fourth pAda of the last shloka  
of Melpattur Sri NarayanabhattapAda(Bhattatiripad)'s magnum opus "Naaraayaneeyam",  
which is dvEdhaa naaraayaneeyam(author being Narayana and the content being  
condensed Srimadbhagavatam).  
Late Brahmashree G.Padmanabha Sastri, a scholar in Thrissur, Kerala had annotated during  
a discourse 40 years ago the compound word under discussion using KATAPAYADI sankhya   
and pointed out the Kali Sankhya or Kollavarsham(which I do not remember) of the completion of  
the text by the Poet.
