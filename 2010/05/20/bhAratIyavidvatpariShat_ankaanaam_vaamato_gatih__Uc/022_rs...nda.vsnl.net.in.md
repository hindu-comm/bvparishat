\> \*My observation and further submission is that the dictum

\> gatih" is simply aimed at decoding and understanding a number

\> symbolic language.While this mostly happens in our manuscripts,at

\>  
\> Coincidentally this "vaamato gatih" also can be traced in the  

\> constitutionof most of the numbers in normal form.If its  

\> "navavimshatih" then consider  
\> madhyamapadalopa and if its ekonavimshatih then be it
