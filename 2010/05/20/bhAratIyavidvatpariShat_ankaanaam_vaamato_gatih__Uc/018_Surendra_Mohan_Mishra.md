**My observation and further submission is that the dictum "ankaanaam vaamato gatih" is simply aimed at decoding and understanding a number expressed in symbolic language.While this mostly happens in our manuscripts,at times one comes across "dakshinato gatih"also to be operative.Which way one has to take in deciphering a number depends on circumstantial evidence and style of the author etc.  
  
Coincidentally this "vaamato gatih" also can be traced in the constitution of most of the numbers in normal form.If its "navavimshatih" then consider madhyamapadalopa and if its ekonavimshatih then be it karmadhaaraya !
