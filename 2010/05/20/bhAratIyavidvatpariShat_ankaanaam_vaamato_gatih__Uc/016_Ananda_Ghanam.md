Pranaam.  
It is pertinent to note that Pancha Vismashati, Ekona Trimsat and  
other words are often formed due to Madhyamapadalopi Samaasa.  
The beauty is to assign importance to a large integer, while stating values.

It also seems that the current pattern used in Middle east had its  
origin in our systems. Even the letter patterns (visual  
representation) also have their originx here. More citations to prove  
this point are scouted for.

It could also be a possibility that our ancestors have modified the  
system to maintain the distinct style, different from the adopters of  
west asia.

Moreover, we did not attach much importance to the visual importance,  
as we relied upon Shruti alone to impart our wisdom. Thus, the visual  
representation of the word forms could be a lateral addition.

Vaamatah is formed with the conjunct Tasi Pratyaya, which is supposed  
to be used in Panchami Vibhakti. However, another averment, at that  
Sutra broadens the scope to include all the Vibhaktis.  
Hence, the gati or implication to construe the value of numbers could  
also be contextual.

More comments/ thoughts welcome.
