I thank all the respected scholars for valuable responses.  
Prof.Veeranarayana Pandurangi has cited very interesting example in  
which the order of ankas is normal. This is very rare exception. He  
says that the statement ‘ankaanaam vaamato gatih’ does not apply to  
the numbers like Panchavimshati. But in my view, it applies to even  
‘panchavimshati’. At the end of this letter I will show how.  
Respected Prof. Veeranarayana Pandurangi, can you please mention the  
number of the issue of Sambhashanasandesh in which Pandit  
Ranganathasharma has given solution to the same problem.At present I  
am not subscriber of Sambhashanasandesh.  
I will try to have the copy of the same from my Bangalore friends.  
Vaama may mean प्रतिकूल as Prof.Dipak Bhattacharya opines. It confirms  
my citing of the reference from Abhijnaanashaakuntala, ‘vaamaah  
kulasyaadhayah’  
After reading the response of Prof.Surendramishra, I thought of a  
different solution for the problem all of a sudden: ‘ankaanaam vaamato  
gatih’is in verse and the metre is anushtubh. It may be of second  
quarter or fourth quarter.I do not know where this adage comes from.  
But there must be a statement prior to this statement as first or  
third quarter. I fill the first(or third?) quarter by my imagination  
and complete the statement as-  
‘‘varnaa dakshinatah shaastreshvankaanaam vaamato gatih’’.  
OR  
‘‘gatir dakshiNato'rNaanaam ankaanaam vaamato gatih’’

Which means, in the shastras, the number-denoting-letters shall be  
moved(=written) from right. But the digital value shall be  
moved(=considered) from left.  
This meaning does fit even to the numbers like Pancha-vimshati !  
And it is because of the practice of reversing the order in the  
numbers that have two or more digits, number-denoting words are  
considered in the reverse order.
