हरि: ॐ  
नमस्ते।  
Besides the fee and other aspects, let me express what I encountered  
2 years ago with the esteemed Japanese counterparts(organizers) of WSC  
in Japan. I was suggested by a renowned scholar/researcher to e-mail the abstract and paper to a Japanese professor. It was done and was acknowledged. After a month or so I got an e-mail from that professor just stating that the paper was "rejected". Had they mentioned their observations it would have been justifiable.  
Further, those who present papers have to be members(!) paying membership, perhaps annually to the "International Association" in dollars.  
However, the rejected paper was well received by true researchers in Bharatam.  
  
None of the proceedings of the earlier WSCs are available online. At least I am yet to get at.
