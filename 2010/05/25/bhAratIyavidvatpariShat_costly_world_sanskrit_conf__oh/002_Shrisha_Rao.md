I know almost nothing about this conference, but Rs. 5000 does not strike me as an excessive rate for an international conference given contemporary trends even in the humanities (conferences in the sciences and engineering can be even more expensive). If a conference has corporate sponsors (who typically pay a few lakhs of rupees each) then the registration rates can be reduced or even waived for certain classes of attendees (e.g., student authors), but failing that, a conference needs to charge such amounts to cover costs like travel for invited attendees, etc., even if the conference halls, lodging rooms, etc., are made available freely by an organizing institution. In this case, perhaps the MHRD is not giving a lot of funds for the conference?
