namo vidvadbhyah



Nibandhana is a commentary , like Brhati , by Prabhakaraguru and it is not available . Rather extensively quoted

in Vidhiviveka and Brahmasiddhi by Mandanamisra and there is similarity between the same discussion and

the one in Brhati ( see p 37, Praastaavikam by Mahaprabhulalgoswamy in Mimamsadarsanam, Part - 2, Tara Book Agency, Varanasi, 2006 ) .



Vivaranam is Bhasyavivaranam of Govindamrtamuni (Yudhisthir Mimamsak said it is very difficult to get - durlabhah - see p27, Prastavana - Hindi - Part - 1) - published for the first time by Tara Book agency with Sabarabhasya, Bhasyavivarana , Tantravartika, Nyayasudha and Bhavaprakasika (Hindi) - 4 Parts .



I cross- checked the quotations with Bhasyavivaranam in both Hetuvannigadadhikarana and Arthavadadhi-

karana and they are correct .



I am prepared to discuuss the subject if it is required by the scholars .
