The term Muhurtam is there in Taittiriya (Kaathaka - Samjnaanam ...) .

Two ghatikas make one Muhurtam, thirty muhurtas make a day .



Sixty ghatikas or 24 hours (i.e. two and half ghatikas make one hour) make one day .

Two and half vighatikas make one minute .  
  
This is the geneal information and we have to refer to Siddhantaskandha for further study .
