To summarize,  
According to Physics all the qualities in the universe have their origin in the Unified Field of Natural Law, which we take to be the Constitution of the Universe from the perspective of modern science. The complete account of the Constitution of the Universe is available in the ancient and timeless Vedic Literature. Throughout time, the eternal Constitution of the Universe has been managing the orderly evolution of all levels of manifest creation; it is the non-changing basis of Natural Law—the ultimate source of order and harmony displayed throughout the universe.  
  
Thus, the forty qualities of the Constitution of the Universe—the forty qualities of Natural Law that comprise the Constitution of the Universe—have been located in terms of their forty corresponding structures and functions in the human physiology and in the forty qualities of the Lagrangian of Superstring Theory—the most fundamental structure of Natural Law from modern science.

PS.The question," what is Vedic research methodology?" remains unanswered in all available web-pages across the www space. But the answers are in the Veda mantras. Those who can search within and provide clues are most welcome.

अथ चेत्त्वमिमं धर्म्यं संग्रामं न करिष्यसि।  
ततः स्वधर्मं कीर्तिं च हित्वा पापमवाप्स्यसि।।  
तस्मादुत्तिष्ठ कौन्तेय युद्धाय कृतनिश्चयः।  
निराशीर्निर्ममो भूत्वा युध्यस्व विगतज्वरः।। (भ.गी.)
