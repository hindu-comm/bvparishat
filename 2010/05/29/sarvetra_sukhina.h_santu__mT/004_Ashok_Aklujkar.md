Dear Dr. Mishra,

I enjoy your contributions, especially the ones in Skt.

That sarve is a nom. pl. in the verse is in fact what I have said. The verse's \*purpose\* might have been to ensure that beginners in Skt do not make the mistake of taking sarve as a loc. sg. But other purposes are also possible. Having similarly structured paadas is a feature found also in old Epic and Puraa.nic verses.

The remark gives the impression that you have seen the verse in some old Buddhist or Jaina work. If that is the case, pl give the details of the work as far as you can remember or confirm them.

In which work attributed to Kaalidaasa the verse you quote is found as a bharata-vaakya?

When you use the phrase "our literature," do you mean to exclude Buddhist and Jaina literature?

The other post of this morning, the one by Dr. Jagannatha, takes our search a little further by locating the verse in the dhyaana-;slokas to be recited after completing a [Raamaaya.na-paaraaya.na](http://Raamaaya.na-paaraaya.na). The questions that arise then are: (a) What is the oldest confirmation of the existence of the custom of [Raamaaya.na-paaraaya.na](http://Raamaaya.na-paaraaya.na). (b) How far back in time do the dhyaana-;slokas go? (c) Which is the earliest version of the dhyaana-;slokas that has the particular verse we are tracing?

There are many verses in Skt which have noble thoughts of the type we find in sarve 'tra sukhina.h santu / sarve bhavantu sukhina.h ... In fact, this is one of the many reasons why I value Skt so much. However, our present search is not for parallels, but for a verse that is identical with or almost entirely the same as the sarve 'tra ... verse and is found in a reasonably old, pre-modern work.
