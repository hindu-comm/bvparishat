Did you intend to write, 'sarvasmin would be the correct word ...'?

\> 2)The verse 'sarvas taratu..' etc. is the last bharatavaakya in the Vikramorvashiiyam at 5.25.

One can be certain that this is not Kaalidaasa's composition. It is probably a manuscript copyist's composition or citation that got attached to the main text in \*some\* Vikramorvashiiya mss. The critical edn by H.D. Velankar (New Delhi: Sahitya Akdemi, 1961) does not include it in the main text. Reva Prasad Dwivedi's edn in his Kaalidaasa-granthaavali, based on a large number of mss, puts it in rectangular parentheses indicating its doubtful standing. I have not come across any other play that genuinely contains more than one bharata-vaakya verse. Besides these objective reasons, the following reasons are also quite weighty in the present case, although they are somewhat subjective in nature: Despite its noble thought, the verse sarve 'tra sukhina.h is quite pedestrian in its wording. There is not even a small element of camatk.rti in it. It is unlikely that Kaalidaasa wrote it. It is even more unlikely that he would place it after the distinctive paraspara-virodhinyor eka-sa.m;sraya-durlabham / sa.mgata.m ;srii-sarasvatyor bhuutaye 'stu sadaa sataam //

The progress we have so far made in the present discussion, therefore, is that the verse sarve 'tra sukhina.h ... follows the pattern of older verses -- that it has a noble tradition (including the more specific svasti prajaabhyah paripaalayantaam verse) behind it, but we still do not know when it itself was composed.

  
\> 4)As per the origin of RAmAyana pArAyaNa,if the UttarakaanDa is to be believed then the tradition should be as old as the epic.

The Uttara-kaa.n.da was probably in place (probably in a shorter form) by A;[sva-gho.sa](http://sva-gho.sa)'s time (not later than 1st century A.D.). However, this does not necessarily mean that the tradition of [Raamaaya.na-paaraaya.na](http://Raamaaya.na-paaraaya.na) is that old or that the present text recited at the end of a [Raamaaya.na-paaraaya.na](http://Raamaaya.na-paaraaya.na) is about 2,000 years old. We need separate evidence (which may not be there) to establish the antiquity of the latter two.

I would expect the verses recited at the end of a [Raamaaya.na-paaraaya.na](http://Raamaaya.na-paaraaya.na) session to be connected with the phala-;sruti verses found at the end of Raamaaya.na/Uttara-kaa.n.daa mss. In the Baroda critical edn of the Raamaaya.na (vol VII, pp. 532-547), many such verses are given. Our sarve 'tra sukhina.h does not figure in them. More importantly, the phala-;sruti passages show considerable variation, indicating that they did not have a common origin and were regional developments (probably/mostly late in origin). The same is likely to be the case of verses concluding a [Raamaaya.na-paaraaya.na](http://Raamaaya.na-paaraaya.na).

It may be helpful if Dr. Jagannatha would give the full text of the [Raamaaya.na-paaraaya.na](http://Raamaaya.na-paaraaya.na). concluding verses he knows and Dr. Surendra Mohan Mishra gives the full text of the VishNuyaaga(smaarta) verses.
