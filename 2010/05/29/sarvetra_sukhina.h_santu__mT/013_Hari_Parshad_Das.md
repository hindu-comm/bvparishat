(There were two posts asking for the same thing, so also posting my reply here).

  

śrī-śrī-rādhā-dāmodarāya namaḥ

  

After looking for this verse for weeks (literally), I finally found it in the last chapter of the Uttara-khaṇḍa of the Garuḍa-purāṇa. I checked many editions just to be sure, and yes it exists in all those editions.  

  

Those who want to see it can download the Garuḍa-purāṇa from the following link:<https://archive.org/details/garudapurana>

  

and see the last page of the PDF. I have also attached a screenshot.

  

sādhu-caraṇa-rajābhilāṣī,

  

hari pārṣada dāsa
