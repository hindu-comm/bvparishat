Dear Prof. Aklujkar,  
Thanks for your kind compliments and the further query.  
1)As per your observation it could be so construed to suit this mode of language teaching.The pity is that we have somewhat if not fully lost touch with the idiomatic use of Sanskrit as a lingua franca.This use of the word 'sarva' in the nom. pl. connected with'santu' or 'bhavantu' points to the fact for a child learner that its not a case of use in loc. and that 'sarvaadiini' would be the correct word in loc.(sarvaadiini sarvanaamaani).  
2)The verse 'sarvas taratu..' etc. is the last bharatavaakya in the Vikramorvashiiyam at 5.25.  
3) Add. to Dr Jagannatha's point that the verse is a part of the chantings at the end of traditional RAmAyaNapATha,  
I remember that in VishNuyaaga(smaarta),daily and at the end,among the host of shlokas chanted as invocation,this verse is very prominent.In that context this verse is followed by 'svasti prajaabhyah paripaalayantu' etc.  
4)As per the origin of RAmAyana pArAyaNa,if the UttarakaanDa is to be believed then the tradition should be as old as the epic.  
5)In Jaina and Buddhist traditions,this verse is chanted in much similar a way as with the Hindus.But an exact ref. of the first occurence of it has to be looked at.  
6)By 'our literature' I mean Sanskrit lit. which is too profound to be fathomed and too great in expansion of ideas to exclude any religion or culture from it's scope.Not that other literature have not contributed significantly,but here alone one could see justification for what Bhartrihari said : prajNaa vivekam labhate bhinnair aagamadarshanaih.  
saprashraya-bahumaanam,
