Thanks Shri H N Bhat for finding out the same passage in the Sharabhopanishat.This verse is also exactly the same at MBh.,Shanti,Mokshadharma,Anusmriti,27.But the Vishnuyaaga text has 'tasmai yajnaatmane namah' for 'sa me vishnuh prasiidatu'.Such a huge and timeless tradition that one fails to fathom the roots : vishnor ivaa'syaanavadhaaraniiyam idriktayaa ruupam iyattayaa vaa as said by Kalidasa.  
But in Br.Up.the verse 'sarve bhavantu' etc. could only be an interpolation in the printed text wherein as you said you located this.  
Regards,
