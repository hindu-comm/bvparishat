Prof. Aklujkar's conjecture may not be feasible as 'sarve' in the verse is clearly in nominative plural.To be in locative singular the word may have to denote Shiva or VishNu.  
The origin of the verse is so far not traced.the first quarter has a variant as 'sarve bhavantu sukhinah'.This may be a floating verse of old times,I found this in use by the Buddhists and Jainas also.If this is there before Kalidasa then he must have taken a cue from this in his following Bharatavaakya :  
sarvastaratu durgaaNi sarvo bhadraaNi pashyatu /  
sarvah kaamaan avaapnotu sarvah sarvatra nandatu //  
However someone may tell us where this verse is first located in our literature.
