We have to bear in mind the possibility that several "subhaa.sitas" were written relatively recently by modern Sanskritists, some of them for illustrating grammar in books meant for teaching Sanskrit; see:

  

Aklujkar, Ashok.2005. "Good sayings fall on critical ears: reflections on subhaa.sitas (part 1)." In *Avani;srii.h, Professor Avanindra Kumar Felicitation Volume*, pp. 178-186. (eds) Chaturvedi, Mithilesh et al. Delhi: Vidyanilayam.  

Aklujkar, Ashok.2005. "Good sayings fall on critical ears: reflections on subhaa.sitas (part 2)." In *Encyclopedia of Indian Wisdom: Professor Satya Vrat Shastri Felicitation Volume*, pp. 839-848. (ed) Sharma, Ram Karan. New Delhi: Bharatiya Vidya Prakashan.

  

The following verse, for example, might have been written to imprint on student minds that sarve is a nominative plural, not a locative singular. (Note that I am not asserting that such indeed was the case, for who can conclusively establish that such and such thing did not exist before a certain time? -- the usual epistemological problem of proving abhaava)
