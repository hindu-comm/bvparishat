Dear Mishra,

  

Thanks for quoting the similar verses in tone together used to recited in the Purnahuti of Vishnuyaga. All the verses are similar in tone and sound like Shanti-mantra-s wishing welfare to all in the benediction. Just I googled and found the last verse caturbhishca caturbhish ca .. etc. belonged to Sharabhopanishat. (Which entails a contradiction about the nature of the Semi-God form Sharabha represents). Here is the page:

  

<http://sanskritdocuments.org/all_sa/sharabha_sa.html>

  

The first verse I found somewhere mentioned as belonging to Brihadaranyaka Upanishat 1.4.14 (which I could not trace in the edition I am having.) "sarve bhavantu sukhinaH etc. ". But the tone of this verse is similar to the others in the collection. I have heard these verses recited at the end of any Pooja, whether it be of Durga, Shiva, or Vishnu alike, which leads one to think as the benediction (or Ashirvacana or Collective Prayer) after the worship is performed.

  

Looking for an ultimate source may not yield much fruit in such cases. This may also apply the verse quoted in question under discussion. It can well be recited after Parayana of Ramayana also, but need not be traced to the original manuscripts of Ramayana. It can well be recited even after Bhagavata also. It would be hopefully better if the ultimate source could be established.It is quite possible such shloka-s are added by the scribes in certain manuscripts of any work after the colophon (in which case it.doesn't form the part of the text obviuously).

  

With regards
