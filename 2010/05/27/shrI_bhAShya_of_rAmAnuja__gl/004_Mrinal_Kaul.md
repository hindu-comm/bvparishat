Thanks for some responses I have received. It is only after trying exhaustively to search for an e-file (either in PFD or .DOC files in Devanagari or Roman script) of the mūla text that I thought of writing to this forum for help. I have obviously come across and downloaded the two volumes as also suggested by Dr S. Mishra. But as you can see they contain the translation only and not the text. I have been looking for the mūla text. A search in the Digital Library of India \<<http://dli.iiit.ac.in>\> gives me an entry ofVedanta Sutras With The Sri Bhashya Of Ramanujaacharya Vol I, Ed:M. Rangacharya, Pub:M.C.Alasingapperumal, Madras (1899),but their server seems to be down for some reason. I do not know if the edition of the Śrībhāṣya published from Melkote Sanskrit Academy has been digitalized or not. It would be wonderful if one can have access to the digital copy of the Melkote edition. Thanks to all. MK
