This publication contains only a translation of the Bhaa.sya. The muula of suutras alone has been printed in it. It has a somewhat complicated history. I had reconstructed it as follows at the time of finishing my recently published article (2009. "V.rtti and V.rttikåra in Råmånuja's ;Srii-bhå.sya." In *Anantam Såstram, Indological and Linguistic Studies in Honour of Bertil Tikkanen, Studia Orientalia* 108: 3-20. (ed) Karttunen, Klaus. Helsinki:

  

Rangacharya, M.; Varadaraja Aiyangar, M.B. 1988, 1991 reprint of second edn. (tr) *The Ved**ānta-sūtras with the Śrī-bhāsya of Rāmānujācārya*.
New Delhi: Munshiram Manoharlal Publishers. The first edn details seem to be these: vol 1: published sometime before 1916, brought out by M. Rangacharya. Revised edn of vol 1 and revised text of the previously unpublished vols 2 and 3: 19611965, brought out by M. Rangacharyaæs son M.R. Sampatkumaran. Madras: Educational Publ. Cooperation.

  

The revised edn has aphotographic reprint which alone was accessible to me. From your note I learn that the first volume was published for the first time in 1899, much before the 1916 limit I had been able to determine.
