हरि ॐ  
नमस्ते।  
Thanks for the New Arrival announcement. Yesterday I met  
Vidyaratnakara Sri Bannanje at "Ishavasyam" where he is taking rest.  
**"60 years of my efforts/study are consolidated in those two volumes", he said.**  
I had sought appointment through his son and was gracefully granted.  
The purpose of the visit was to present to him the content of the my discussion  
with H.H Sri Sugunendra Teertha Swaminah of Puthige Mutt.  
A Conference(National/International) on Vedic Sciences is being  
contemplated. He responded with a few remarks(for want of time  
as he was to be present elsewhere). The clues were enough.  
**"Research has become necessary.... people have become slaves  
of gadgets. The God given gadget, the brain is to be put to maximum use.."  
Prevent those gadgets which prevent proper use of God given gadgets!**  
  
As I remembered the "New Arrival" announcement, I went to Car Street on return  
to inquire about the books and thank God, found the notice at the entrance of Palimar Mutt  
that 31-05-2010 is the last date to avail oneself of the special offer at Rs.1000/=.  
Hope to get it autographed next time!
