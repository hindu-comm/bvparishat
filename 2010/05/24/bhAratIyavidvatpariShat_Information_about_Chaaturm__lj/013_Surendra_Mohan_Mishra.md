Esteemed Scholars,  
Let me add a little to the fine discussion on the concept of seasons which has been addressed by scholars very well.  
The Atharva Veda,in KaaNDa 13 as I recall,has a mantra which gives 6 twins as 6 seasons and one extra month that is the adhimaasa.I quote : "idam savitar vijaaniihi saD yamaa eka ekajah / tasmin haapitvam icchanti ya esaam eka ekajah //"  
The division of a year has been traditionally into 2,3,4,5 & 6 seasons."madhush ca me maadhavash ca me" etc in the Yajurveda also is abut the 'twinness' of the pairs of months as that speaks of a single kind of environment or climatic condition varying only in degree.  
The word is derived from the root 'Ri' or 'Rik' meaning 'to go'.Thus its a passing phase of time with specific nature.  
The same hymn of AV as quoted from above mentions that these specific time-units 'Ritu-s' and their products 'aartava-s' finally do rech back to the original stuff which is Skambha : "yatra yanti Ritavo yatra aartavaah skambham tam bruuhi katamah svid eva sah /".
