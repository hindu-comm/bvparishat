Namaamsi -  
Appreciating the interest in the topic of Seasons, let me explain some more instances.  

1.  Six seasons are widely mentioned in Vedic Scriptures, including
    Soutramani which are quoted already, in these discussions. 2.  Prayaaja, an important Aahuti in Srouta Ishti, enlsits the Ritu
    Devata as the presiding/ interested deity for each of them. In this
    context, Hemanta and Sisira Ritu as one. हेमन्त शिशिरावृतूनां
    प्रीणामि - तौ मा प्रीतौ प्रीणीताम्। 3.  In addition, the Number 17, in its references in Chayana Yajna, also
    refers this combination. सप्तदश रात्री र्दीक्षित स्स्याद्द्वादश
    मासाः पञ्चर्तव स्स संवथ्सरः। (Practically too, leaves fall due to
    withering in harsh winter.  
    शिशिर means cold, Hemanta is derived from Hima. Hence the combined
    term Winter for both of them is justified. And Three seasons, cannot
    be attributed in Indian context only. In the west, Spring and Fall
    are the common words for Academic Semesters.) 4.  Therefore, it is appropriate to conclude that the Number Six (for
    Seasons) is contextual and not difinitive. (We have innumerable
    quotations to justify this assertion.) 5.  Another interesting point of turn in provided in Ekaadasa Raatra
    Satra Yaaga (Saptama Kanda - Dwiteeya Prapaathaka, Taittiteeya -
    Yajurveda). The story narrates about the division of Ritu. ऋतवो वै
    प्रजाकामाः ... (This has a direct correlation with biological
    evolution too. (Division of Cells is what called Growth in Living
    Organisms). Aartava is a word used for Maasa. ऋतूनां वा एते पुत्रा
    स्तस्मादार्तवा उच्यन्ते। This qualifies that Maasa is the next
    division of Ritu.  
6.  Prior to this, Samvatsara Kaala Vibhaga (Division of Samvatsara into
    Equitable Ritus) is described in Pancharaatra Satra. {Here too
    Pancha Sankhyaa (Number Five) seems to indicate the incidence of
    Five Ritus.} संवत्सरो वा इद मेक आसीत् ... सोकामयर्तून् सृजेयेति
    (Purport: Earlier, the annular path was devoid of such positions
    capable of causing seasonal changes. Then, it was deemed necessary
    to create the seasons for a flourishing world in various aspects.  
7.  Ritu is also known as Shaashtika, as it has 60 days. We can also
    find the detailed description of Ritus in Aaruna Ketuka Chayana
    ऋतूर्ऋतुना नु्द्यमानः। .... अत्यूर्ध्वाक्षो तिरश्चात्। Here the
    number six is mentioned in detail, with more focus on the Winter
    Chill during Sisira (as the late white winter had its effect till
    March - April in North America and Europe this year) 8.  The chapter concludes with the Statement that, whoever knows the
    Description, Acts according to the Prescription (ऋतुचर्या -
    आयुर्वेद) and Rituals), will be the master of Ritus. ( तस्मै ऋतवो
    नमन्ते।) 9.  The Ritus are formed by the Six Rays (Orbital Angle Position
    Processed Rays) of the Surya (Sun), for the sustenance of the world.
    षडुद्यमा ऋषयो देवजा.. तेषामिष्टानि विहितानि धामशः। स्थात्रे रेजन्ते
    विकृतानि रूपशः। They differ (change) in their forms, every year, to
    suit the planet and its inhabitants.  

With the focus on the Ritu, its formation, concer
