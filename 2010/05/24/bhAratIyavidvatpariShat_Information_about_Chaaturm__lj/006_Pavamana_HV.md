Dear scholars,  
Thanks all for information.  
Can anybody also throw some light on the etymological meaning of each of these Ritus?  
Also what was the "new year" concept in vedic times?  
Once while discussing about Gitas where Lord Krishna says "मासानां मार्गशीर्शोस्मि" my friend mentioned that margashira was considered as beginning of new year. Is it true that Hemanta was the new year in earlier times? Can somebody throw some light?
