**अनूहूतोध्वरं गच्छेत्

**============

**A Short note about **

**Chaaturmaasya Ishti  
**  
**Time** is an inseparable and important component in the creation.

This is represented by Seasons.  
  
**Ishti** is a wonderful and comprehensive form of Homa, mandated by Veda. Chatur = Four. Maasa= Month. Every Four months form a cluster, denoting the change of season. This is also broadly classified as summer, Rains and winter.

The Ishti conducted at each Cluster of Four Months is **Chaatur Maasya Ishti.**

(However, ancillary scriptures have permitted the conduct of the series once a year;

as a matter of convenience.)  
  
**Purpose** of Chaturmaasya Ishti (which is stipulated to be conducted annually, in three tranches) is to propitiate the deities of seasons namely,

**Viswe Devaa, Agni, Indra, Aaditya, Varuna, Vaayua, Shiva **

along with the deities of ancestry (Pitru Devata) and the Almighty Paramastman.  
  
**Purport** of the Mantras, is **Prayers** for the welfare of the communities, timely rains and averting natural calamities, bountiful food/ crops, comfortable life and seemless transition to next states of divinity, after this life.  
  
On this sacred occasion of **Silver Jubilee Celebrations of SGS Veda Pathasala**, Datta Peetham conducts the Rituals for the wellbeing of the Society and appointed capable scholars as **Ritwiks**, namely:

1. BrahmaSri Matturu R **Kesava Avadhani** (Chief Pundit)

2. Brahmasri **Ranganatha Sarma** Agnihotri - Mysuru (Yajamaana – Principle Incharge)

3. Brahmasri **Raghavendra** - Matturu

4. Brahmasri **Venkatesa Avadhani** - Matturu

5. Brahmasri Chandra **Sekhara** Avadhani VLSK – Mysuru

6. Brahmasri **Vaasudeva Paraanjape** – Mysuru (Meemaamsa Scholar)

**Note about Importance of Pradhana Homa during Ishti: **

After an elaborate process to prepare the Havis (Food) for Oblation (Aahuti), the Pradhana Homa will be performed. This is the most important stage of each Ishti, which would happen in the middle of the Ishti. Contrary to notions, rather than the Poornahuti (before conclusion), this **Pradhana Homa** is the time for devotees to witness.
