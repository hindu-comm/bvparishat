हरि: ॐ  
नमस्ते।  
Thanks a lot for further explanations.  
\>.....whoever knows the description, acts according to the prescription (ऋतुचर्या - आयुर्वेद and Rituals), will be the master of Ritus. ( तस्मै ऋतवो नमन्ते।)  
Acting according to the prescription is what really matters. But in the modern civilized society one will have to brave the consequences of not giving "company" to those who eat the meal standing and walking, wearing shoes!(प्रेतपिशाचा: खलु तिष्ठन् धावन्खादन्ति !)  
Having rendered the biological clock in our body defunct through civilized ways of living how can we ever hope to be in perfect harmony with the Nature, in every sense as meant by "will be the master of Ritus. ( तस्मै ऋतवो नमन्ते।)". To eat when not hungry and to drink when not thirsty and to meet without any season and reason is civilized living , in short the cryptical words of Bhagavan Sri Vedavyasa: मनुष्यरूपेण मृगा: चरन्ति !  
Let us remind ourselves the words of wisdom by Sage Charaka:  
शष्टिकां शालिमुद्गां च सैन्धवामलकी यवान्।  
आन्तरीक्षं पय: सर्पि: जाङ्गलं मधु च अभ्यसेत् ।।  
Further,  
मितं भुक्त्वा शतं गत्वा जप्त्वा च शतनामकं।  
वामभागे शयानस्य भिष्ग्भि: किं प्रयोजनं ।।  
प्रणाम:
