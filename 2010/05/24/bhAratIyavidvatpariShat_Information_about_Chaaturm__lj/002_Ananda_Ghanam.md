Namaamsi.  
  
It is true that ऋतु is broadly translated as Season. However, in this context the cluster/ group of two seasons is to be understood.  
  
This is also reflected in Saavitraagni Chayana Prakarana, when it is mentioned:  

1.  अग्निर् ऋतुः 2.  सूर्य ऋतुः 3.  चन्द्रमा ऋतुः

At this point, Vidyaaranya Swamy - mentions about the incidence of three seasons.  
  
Correlation:  
It is a matter of fact, that calculation of Months in Chandramaana directly dependent on (approximately) 29 days of Chaandra Maasa. (This works out to be 58 days per each ऋतु). This count will be in approximation, due to the ever changing climatic phenomenon based on the coordinates of latitude, longitude apart from other factors.  
  
Cluster of 4 months (first mentioned) is reflective of the actual incidence on the globe. Hence, this nomenclature is given in the Vedic Tradition, to broadly include the seasons. (Instead of searing heat, in the Hemanta Ritu, as it happens in Feb/ Mar), Rains in Vasanta and Greeshma (Apr - Jul), as we experience in this part of the country.
