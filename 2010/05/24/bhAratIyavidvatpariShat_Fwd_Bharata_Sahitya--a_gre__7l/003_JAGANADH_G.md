Dear Sir  
  
The <http://wikisource.org/wiki/%E0%A4%AE%E0%A5%81%E0%A4%96%E0%A4%AA%E0%A5%83%E0%A4%B7%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A0%E0%A4%82:%E0%A4%B8%E0%A4%82%E0%A4%B8%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%83%E0%A4%A4> also contains several Sanskrit books in UTF-8 . If students in our universities can volunteer to proof read these documents it will be nice. Also we will get a central repo for Sanskrit texts. IF the books in available in the <http://sites.google.com/site/bharatasahitya> is submitted to wiki in UTF-8 format that will be a great contribution .
