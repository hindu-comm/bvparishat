I do not know what software I have to use for writing SamskRita in  
Devanaagari.(At present, I use Prakashak software for my SamskRita  
works.But this Prakashak can not be used for internet.)So I used  
Roman script instead of Devanaagarii. Please suggest me how I can use  
Devanaagarii in my future discussions in SamskRita.
