**About Sutralakshana**  
  
Namo Namah!  
Dear friends,  
May I suggest an explanation?  
Stobha is derived from the verbal root stubh meaning 'to stop', 'to pause'. Usually stubha indicates rhythmic pause. In Samaveda too, stobha denotes the chanted interjection like 'hum', 'ho' etc. 'Yati' in [metres.is](http://metres.is) also a rhythmic pause. In trishtubh, anushtubh we find stubh used in that sense.  
Sutra is basically a prose statement and not a metrical line. It does not require any rhythmic pauses as a line in a metre does.It is usually 'alpakshara' and does not need any pause. Even if it is bahvakshara it is read continuously without any pauses as e.g. kridh drih irsh asuyarthanam yam prati kopah.  
Thus to distinguish Sutra from a line in a metre the word 'astobha' is used in the definition.  
regards
