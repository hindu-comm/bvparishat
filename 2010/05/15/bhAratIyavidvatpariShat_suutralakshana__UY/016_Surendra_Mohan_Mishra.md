**As Prof K Subrahmanyam has put it not necessarily the suutras are so definitively precise always.He has given examples.The Yuktidiipikaa comm. accepts the Saamkhyakaarikaas as suutras.The suutras also could contain elements of bhaashya and vaartika in them.i.e.they are explicative to produce a better understanding.DiNnaaga said 'pratyaksham kalpanaapoDham'.Dharmakiirti thought it to be inadequate.He supplied an explicative : 'pratyaksham kalpanaapoDham abhraantam'.In PaaNini suutras also many redundant elements could be pointed out.In the anumaana-suutra in Nyaaya the commentator wants to support Gautama as he uses the word 'trividham'in the suutra which is not required as the types are just following.Fault of tautology,repetition !The ideal is to be the most precise,but its not at the cost of clarity.  
  
In the suutra-lakshaNa,the word 'astobham' seems to be more linked with 'alpaaksharam' and 'saaravad' and the last adjective 'anavadyam' puts forth the exact requirement.This one could refer to as avyaaptyativyaaptyasambhava-raahityam.But who ever said that this statement occuring perhaps in the Paraashara UpapuraaNa is a logical definition ?Its a matter of confusing a description as definition and too much relying on the scholarly error of 'sthitasya gatish cintaniiy**aa' !
