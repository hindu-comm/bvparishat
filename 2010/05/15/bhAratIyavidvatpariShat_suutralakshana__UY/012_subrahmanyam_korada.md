I rather think that my response should have been in a more amplified form .



A direct answer to the 'reshaped question' is - in my opinion - the definition without 'astobham' will

sufficeand there will not be any loss of meaning as the other qualifier, i.e. anavadyam ( without

avyaapti, ativyapti and asambhava) will take care of it .



Repitition for clarity can be there - Tadadhiite tadveda - Panini employed two tad sabdas in this Sutra ( see Bhasyam, Pradipa and Udyota).



But once it is there we have to account for it - a Vakyam which is alpaaksaram etc is a Sutram.

In other words the(Mahaa) Vakyartha meant by Sutrakara is expressed with economy of letters - it may be as small as ' a a ' (Panini's last Sutra).



Patanjali clearly states that a Sutra is just like a condensed form of a Mahavakya (Paspasa) --



na hi sutrata eva sabdaan pratipadyante, kim tarhi? vyaakhyaanatasca - iti . parihrtametat -- tadeva

sutram vigrhiitam vyaakhyaanam bhavati. nanu coktam - na kevalam carcaapadaani vyaakhyaanam

-vrddhih aat aijiti , kim tarhi ? udaaharanam pratyudaaharanam vakyaadhyaahaarah ityetat smuditam

vyaakhyaanam bhavati. avijaanata etadevam bhavati . sutrata eva hi sabdaan pratipadyante. aatasca

sutrata eva.



Udyota says - etanmuulakameva pathyate -- sutresveva hi tatsarvam yadvrttau yacca vaartike .  
  
Therefore the question of word does not come (as Visesyam) in the definition .

Rather Sutram is a Sabdasamjnaa just like Vakyam, Yajuh, Rk etc. and it can / should be explained as a ' Vakyaikadesa' or an incomplete / elliptical sentencewhere some ellipses have to be added to get a complete sentence.



There are usages like - vyastabhnaat rodasii (Yajurveda) etc. but following Prakarana I think astobha

means naativyaapta .
