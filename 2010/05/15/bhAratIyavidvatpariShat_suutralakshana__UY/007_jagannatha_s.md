Respected scholars,  
I am very grateful to you all for responding so quickly for my query.  
A-stobha means the sentence which does not have (shall not have ? )  
stobha. Stobha is a special kind of utterance of lengthened svaras and  
semivowels that are added to Saamans. (It is very interesting that  
even in Karnataka music also this kind of stobhas one can find in  
some Lakshanageetas. For example ‘Re Re Sriramachandra  
Yaduvamshatilaka-Aarabhi raaga, Triputa taala. But that is different  
matter.) My query is, the word astobha in the definition of sutra  
will become necessary only when there is possibility of ativyapti in  
the sentences where in spite of alpaaksharatva, there is no sutratva  
because of stobha. Is there any sentence of this kind where there is  
possibility of miscomprehension of sutratva? This question has  
remained unanswered.  
Prof. Karoda Subrahmanya has rightly pointed out that the definition  
does not have object qualified(visheshya). But as the learned  
professor opines, that the definition applies to sentence and not  
word.  
Let us assume that a-stobha means a-vyartha as Prof. Rachuri Achar  
has shown. Now what about the sentences like ‘‘ghato’sti,  
pato’sti’’ ? Saaravat and Vishvatomukham have already conveyed the  
meaning avyarthatva.(In the case of vyarthatva both will become  
futile.) Avahelana means, (it appears ) blame (Prof.I.V.Nacharya).  
So astobha means flawlessness. But in this case ‘anavadyam’ will be  
superfluous! Even taking the meaning avyaaptirahitam to astobha  
belongs to the same category.  
Noteworthy meanings are Stambhana (to stop) (shown by  
Prof.I.V.Nacharya)and rhythmic pass (caesura)(shown by Prof. Nalini  
Sadhale)But the problem here is sutras are not necessarily in prose.  
In Mimamsa sutras, some sutras are in Anushtubh metre. In some  
sutras, they are in half (ex. vidhirvaa syaad apuurvatvaad  
vaadamaatram hyanarthakam 1.2.19) or in quarter(aakrtistu  
kriyaarthatvaat 1.3.32). Very rarely, the pronunciation of two sutras  
one by one without passing makes one quarter even in Vyaakarana.(If we  
pronounce the first two Ashtaadhyaayii sutras, they make second or  
fourth quarter of Anushtubh. Pronounce ‘‘vriddhiraadaijadeN gunah’’  
and observe the result.)  
It is correct that Stobha is semantically useless musical application  
as Prof.Surendramishra says. But the main question has remained  
unsettled.  
I will reshape the question:  
Is the definition of sutra will be incomplete without the word  
Astobha ?  
Am I wrong in opining that whatever one expects in the definition of  
sutra is fulfilled by other adjectives?  
Thanking sincerely to all the scholars who have enriched my knowledge  
by very useful shastric quotations.
