Esteemed Scholars,  
The word 'stobha'in the puranic definition of a sutra could have all the three elements as denoted by the word showed by Acharyavarya quoting from the lesser known Sarvasambodhinii-NighanTu :  
1)'Stobha' viz.हावु ३ etc expressly meaningless utterances as a filler or musical application having no semantic contribution which is absent in a terse aphorism implying व्यर्थाक्षरराहित्यम् .  
2)'Helanam' is disregard or ease besides other meanings.Disregard is not to fall into a logical continuity and ease is यादृच्छिकत्व or अपरनिरपेक्षस्वार्थघटकत्व.This is not so in a suutra.  
3)"Stobha' as 'stambhana' also holds good in the definition : There is no obstruction,stopping or finality in a suutra as it has to operate in prospect and retrospect,it anticipates both antecedents and consequents,सिंहावलोकन and मण्डुकप्लुति etc are well known.This further explains it's being विश्वतोमुख .  
'Stobha' also means praise or eulogy and a suutra is necessarily free from that.The six definitive characteristics of a suutra samjNaa etc are clear on this.Hence the statement ardhamaatraalaaghavena etc.  
The PaNinian root ष्टुभि स्तम्भे offers this formation.The other meaning could be an extension of the same."Stoma" has some semantic resemblance to 'stobha'.All suutras are accepted as sentences practically,a thing fulfilled by the vrittis.  
The word 'suutra'could be derived from the root 'sutra' in the sense of वेष्टन and विमोचन or etymologically from the root 'suuc' as found in the statement संसूचनार्थत्वात सूत्रस्य.
