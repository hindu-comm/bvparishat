Dear Scholar Friend,  
praNamyA. From the website [www.baraha.com](http://www.baraha.com) you will find "Baraha Direct"If you download it and place it on your desk-top and click it, it will come down to the right hand corner on the start menu bar.Just below the  
"Baraha Direct" you will find "EN" When you click it you will find a verticle bar with items written as "Ansi,Unicode,language like one by one vertically.If you click "Language" to its left or right you will see various  
languages one by one vertically.If you click at sanskrit you will see the"EN" changed into "SA" and "Unicode"  
with a tick mark.Unicode is the "Font".When "SA" appears you can directly write in sanskrit script in the message body of the Email window.For your desired languages process is the same.Please try once.And let me know your difficulty.  
Regards,  
[I.V.Nacha...@yahoo.co.in]()
