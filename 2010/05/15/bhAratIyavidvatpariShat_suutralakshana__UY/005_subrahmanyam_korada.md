namo vidvadbhyah



The verse is there in Visnudharmottara (3-5-1) and Parasaropapurana .



There is no Visesyam in the verse and therefore the term ' vakyam' has to be supplemented - alpaaksaraadi-

visesanavisistam vaakyam sutram - ityarthah .



In Modern Linguistics we can call it an 'elliptical sentence' -- where are you comimg from ? hostel . Here

'hostel' is an elliptical sentence and not a word.



A Sutram is , in other words, a Vaakyaikadesa .



Astobham -- stunbhu is a Sautradhaatu -- stanbhustunbhuskanbhuskunbhuskunbhyah snusca (Panini 3-1-82)

\- see Kryaadi in Kaumudii -- it can be stubhnoti (snu) or stubhnaati (snaa) .



Stobha - is ghan - pratyayaanta .



There is difference of opinion about the meaning of the verb - see Kaumudii.



Kaustubhah - kuh = prthivii , taam stubhnaati vyaapnotiiti kustubhah = samudrah , tatra bhavah (an) kaustubhah

\- therefore astobha can be ' naativyaaptam' , i.e. without the defect (dosa) - ativyapti .



If it is argued thatativyaapti is taken care of by ' anavadyam' ( dosarahitam ) then ' spastaartham '.



Even if it is said - stobha means ' adhikam ' then also one may counter that it is gataartha by ' alpaaksaram'.



Dhaatuunaam anekaarthatvaat - any argument can be taken.



Kesavamisra in his Gautamiiyasuutraprakaasa comments ( p 3 - Ganganath jha Vidyaapitham) - astobham



anadhikam .



A beautiful expression by Sankaracarya in Janmaadisutra -- Vedaantavaakyakusumagrathanaarthatvaat



suutraanaam, Vedaantavaakyaani hi suutrairudaahrtya vicaaryante ( Slesa - sutra means thread also,



therefore Sutras are like a sutra useful in stringing together ) .  
  
The definition fits terribly in Panini .
