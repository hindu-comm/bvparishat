namo vidvadbhyah



neksetodyantamaadityam naastamyantam kadaacana etc is from Manusmrti (3rd Adhyaaya) of Bhrgumaharsi . Generally in such cases no reason is assigned - since Rsis are 'saaksaatkrtadharmaanah' we are supposed to follow .



According to Ayurveda glaring at rising,setting (etc.) Sun would cause Myopia . Triphalaghrtam is prescribed as medicine .



The related discussion is available in Sabarabhasyam, Tantravartikam and Brhati under

-- ubhaabhyaam vaa na hi tayoh dharmasastram (Jaiminisutram 6-4-7-25).



This is an example of Prasajyapratisedha - both Vidhi and Nisedha will be there and Nisedha

is Siddhaanta as Mahavakya prevails upon Avantaravakya .



Barhisi rajatam na deyam - is Srti ( Taittiriyasamhita 1-5-1-2) -one should not place Silver on

Barhis ( because it has come from the tears of Rudra etc.) .



There is a nindaarthavaada which is sesa of the above Nisedha - so'rodiit yadarodiit tadrudrasya rudratvam and upapatti - yo barhisi rajatam dadyaat puraasya samvatsaraat

grhe rodanam bhavati ( within one year there wil be rodanam in the person's house).



One can have a ful length discussion under - Gunavaadastu (Jaiminisutram - 1-2-1-10)

by Sabaraswamy, Kumarila and Prabhakaraguru(Brhatii).



I discussed both these sentences from Smrti and Srti as per Sabarabhasya, Tantravartika and Brhati in my first work(PhD Thesis) - Mahavakyavicaarah, 1986).



If required a detailed explanation can be offered taking Purvamimamsa exclusively.



Arthavadas are not to be taken seriously . In our society people prefer to have a piece of

gold on a silver-dining-plate due to the above --- rudra - asru - prabhavatva of Rajatam,





dhanyo'smi
