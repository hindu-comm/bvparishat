Dear scholars  

keeping the fact into consideration pointed out by Surendra Mohan Mishraji it seems to me that to avoid contact of infra-red rays with eyes it was said not see the Sun at the morning and evening. It is a fact that the wavelength of infrared rays is much more in comparison with other rays. Therefore the Sun is seen red at the morning and evening.

With regards
