My friends in science told me that its ultraviolet and infra red rays in the sun that causes harm to the sight if one stares at the sun.Why then at the morning and evening ? Its so said because only at these times its easy to look at the beautiful sun,at other times one is naturally dissuaded due to the unbearable glare.ShaastreNa dhrmaniyamanam.This shows that our shaastras have scientific foundations.One mantra in the Atharvaveda also prays to the Sun to kindly keep away his seventh ray from sight.
