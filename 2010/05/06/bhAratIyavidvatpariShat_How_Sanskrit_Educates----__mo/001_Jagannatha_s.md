Dear sir,

My name is Jagannatha.

I want to say something about the entry Ashva of
Laghushabdarthasarvasva you gave in this website.

I had seen two volumes of the said work some five years ago.

I copied the entry Ashva.

I appended full text of the entry Ashva as seen in

Laghu Shabdaartha Sarvasva in my Sanskrit work ‘‘Samskritavaanmaye
Vishvakoshaah’’.

My work is published by Mantralaya, Karnool District, Andhrapradesh.

I have introduced 15 encyclopedic works very briefly in my work.

It was published in the year 2009.

Thanking you,

Yours,

Jagannatha
