I have heard from my father a slightly different version:



"sarvatra jayam anvicchet putrAt **shish.yAt** parAjAyam"  
and never found out any textual source for it.



Just as I never found the source for the other profound principle of Ancient Indian Philosophy of Education:



"AcAryAt pAdam Adhatsva

pAdam s-brahmachAritAh/

pAdam adhyApanenaiva

pAdam kAla-kramen.a tu//"



What a balanced and insightful distribution of sources of learning.

But where is this from ?
