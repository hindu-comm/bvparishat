Dr. Mira,

I appreciate the precise information you have given about the occurrence of the insightful verse, regarding the source of which Prof. Arindam Chakrabarti had queried (I assume that there is an indication in the Ujjwala to the effect that the verse is being cited -- that it is not being composed by Hara-datta himself). Now we know that the verse is at least one thousand years old. I hope that we will have similar luck also with the line sarvato jayam anvicchet putraad icchet (/putraac ;si.syaat) paraajayam about the source of which I had sought help.
