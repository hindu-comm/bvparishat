[[Hari Parshad Das	2016-08-20, 12:46:38 [Source](https://groups.google.com/g/bvparishat/c/Repa7LdHJp4)]]



The source is Sri Nīlakaṇṭha's commentary on Mahābhārata, Udyoga-parva, Chapter 44, Verse 16. The verse on which he is commenting also says something similar:  
***  
kālena pādaṁ labhate tathārthaṁ tataś ca pādaṁ guru-yogataś ca  
utsāha-yogena ca pādam ṛcchecchāstreṇa pādaṁ ca tato 'bhiyāti***  
  
Translation: The brahmacārī attains a quarter of the meaning of the Vedas by passage of time; a quarter by staying with the Guru; a quarter by his own enthusiasm and a quarter by mutual discussion with others.  
  
Nīlakaṇṭha quotes this subhāṣita in his commentary. I have attached the excerpt to this message. In the Mahābhārata with Nīlakaṇṭha's commentary that i uploaded on <http://archive.org/details/mahabharata_nk> you can find it on page number 1385 of the PDF.  
  
sādhu-caraṇa-rajo 'bhilāṣī,  
  
hari parshad das.
