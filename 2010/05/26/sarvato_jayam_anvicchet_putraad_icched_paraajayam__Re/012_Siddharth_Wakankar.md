I am reminded of a quotation from a Brahmana-text.I do not have the exact reference,but,the idea is almost similar.It is just possible that this Vedic quotation might be the basis of the the Nilakantha-quotation.

  

आचार्यात्पादमादत्ते पादमेकं स्वमेधया /

  

पादं सब्रह्मचारिभ्यः पाद: कालेन पच्यते //

  

सिद्धार्थ वाकणकर
