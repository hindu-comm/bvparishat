In the initial posting of my query, icched in the subject line should be icchet. I should have removed the sandhi error before forwarding the query.

In the helpful reference given by Srinidhi (reproduced below), sabrahmacAribhyo should be sabrahmacAribhya.h.

The verse as I heard it had the following readings:  
aacaaryaat paadam aadatte paada.m ;si.sya.h sva-medhayaa /  
paada.m kaalena labhate paada.m sabrahmacaaribhi.h //
