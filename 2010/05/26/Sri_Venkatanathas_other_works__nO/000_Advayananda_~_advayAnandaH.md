Dear Scholars,  
  
There is a Advaita based commentary on the Bhagawad Gita named 'Brahmanandagiri' published by Srirangam Vanivilas Press in 1912, authored by one Venkatanatha, disciple of Sri Ramabrahmananda Tirtha. I find this commentary very lucid and wonderful.  
  
In this above-mentioned work 'Brahmanandagiri', the author speaks of three of his others writings: (1) Advaita-vajra-panjara, (2) Mantrasara-sudha-nidhi, and (3) his commentary on Taittiriya Upanishad (title not mentioned). He keeps referring to them of and on (especially the Advaita-vajra-panjara), asking us to refer to them for further explanation or clarification.  
  
Does anyone know about these works? Whether it has been published? Or whether any manuscripts of these texts are available? Shall be thankful for any information in this regard.  
  
With regards and gratitude,  
Advayananda
