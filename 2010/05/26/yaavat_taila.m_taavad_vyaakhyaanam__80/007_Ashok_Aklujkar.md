Thank you. Like the one reported by Dr. V. Pandurangi, what you convey is an extended or generalized meaning. The proverb would not be a proverb unless it has this sort of meaning. The suggested meaning also arises plausibly from the literal meaning. The context it presupposes ('a scholar writing a commentary or explanatory notes at night / in darkness') is narrower or more specific than the context presupposed in my interpretation (b) that received support from Dr. Pandurangi's father's usage of yaavat tailam .... ('someone explaining or commenting on a text in a lecture'). However, it is not an improbable context.

Incidentally, the Marathi counterpart of the Kannada saying you quote would be antharuu.n(a) paahuun(a) paay(a) [pasara.ne](http://pasara.ne).
