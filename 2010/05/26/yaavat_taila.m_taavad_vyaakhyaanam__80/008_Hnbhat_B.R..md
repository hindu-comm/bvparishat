I remember having heard this or similar context in the case of Bhamati commentary of Vacaspati Mishra. The legend goes that he was writing day and night even after he got married and never noticed there is another live. Every day his wife used to light the lamp as the night falls. One day the light went off due to shortage of oil. She came to replace the lamp lit filled with oil, and then only he asked he noticed her in the light of the lamp. She reminded him she was married to him and she was engaged in her service as he was writing the commentary she didn't want to disturb him. By that time, she was old also and she was honored by naming his commentary after her name Bhamati. 

  

I don't know the source of this legend. This story might have been built upon the saying simply to glorify the commentary.
