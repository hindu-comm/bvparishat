my own father used to tell me that our classes should not be यावत्तैलं तावद्व्याख्यानम् that is our classes should not be bookbased but memorybased so they continue even after the oil is burnt. For the memory based classes there is no need to see the books and hence no need of oil also. this was his intention.



it is totally another matter that I still belong to यावत्तैलं तावद्व्याख्यानम् category.
