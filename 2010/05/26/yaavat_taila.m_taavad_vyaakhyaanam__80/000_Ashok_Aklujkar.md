I have heard the proverb given in the subject line but have not seen it (or do not recall seeing it) in any text. I can imagine how it could have arisen and what its intended message would be. However, I would like to go beyond mere guessing. Any help you can offer as to the source and/or occurrences of the proverb (with a specification of the context), as wel as your surmises as to the intended import of the proverb will be gratefully received.
