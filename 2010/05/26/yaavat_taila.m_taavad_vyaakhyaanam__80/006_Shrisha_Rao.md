I queried of my teacher Prof. Prahladacharya the meaning of this expression. He says it has the sense that one's activity or disposition is constrained by one's resources, akin to the Kannada ಚಾಪೆ ಇದದ್ಷುಟ್ ಕಾಲು ಚಾಚುವುದು ("to stretch one's feet \[only\] as long as the mat obtains") or the English "to cut one's coat according to one's cloth." He does not think the idiom has the sense of condemning book-learning as opposed to real knowledge.
