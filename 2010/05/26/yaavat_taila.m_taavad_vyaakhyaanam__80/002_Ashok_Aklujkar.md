Thank you very much Dr. Pandurangi, for the valuable piece of information. It confirms my second, preferred, guess. This is what I had written to the person who asked me about the proverb:

  

\>(b) 'The lecturer needs his written text; he does not know the subject so well as to be able to expound it without any external tools; he is still a raw scholar, a person of limited capabilities.'\<

  

In the case of my first interpretation, I had made the mistake of taking the context too narrowly:

  

\>" the context in which it \[= the proverb\] arose would have been one of popular religious expository lectures (usually referred to with such words as kiirtanas, hari-kiirtanas, hari-kathaas etc. in modern languages). At the time of such lectures, commonly an oil lamp is lit. When the oil is fully consumed, the lamp naturally goes out. If the lecturer concludes his exposition as soon as the lamp goes out, one would say*yaavat taila. m taavad vyaakhyaanam.*From its literal meaning 'The lecture/explication (exists/lasts only) as long as the oil (lasts)' I can see the following figurative meanings as arising: (a) 'One gets what one pays/provides for; there is no free lunch.' The host of the lecturer gets as much time of the latter as the time for which he provides oil."\<

  

I was not comfortable with this interpretation because I did not consider it probable that a religious lecturer would act in such an ungracious way, especially when he/she had nothing to gain personally, and that the hosts would commonly fail to provide more oil. In my experience, such lecturers have generally been very generous with their time as well as accommodative of the host's limitations. I am glad we can set aside the first guess.
