हरि: ॐ  
नमस्ते।  
Dear Sri Abhilash ji,  
20 questions are well chosen and the "ProProps" Quiz Maker is good  
software.  
The idea of awarding a printable Certificate is really good. If it were embedded  
with a picture of Lord Sri Narasimha it would have gathered more spiritual value.  
जय जय लक्ष्मिनरसिंह! would have been sufficient if there is no provision for including a picture.  

[TABLE]

That he should not be killed by Devas is inclusive of Vishnu. In this case the question needs to be changed. Answer D is incomplete.......and it seems to be an answer by elimination!  
Congrats for a worthwhile and fruitful effort.
