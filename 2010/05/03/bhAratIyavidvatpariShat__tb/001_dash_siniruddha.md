Dear Sir,  
Really it is very shokinng to learn about a colleague like Varkhediji.I join with you all for the same. Actually I am now in Stockholm with my son and daughter-in-law. Iam returning to Chennai on 25th may. Yesterday I received a mail from Prof. Harban Mukhia inviting us to Prague Conference.I have already expressed my willingness to attend the same.I have given a topic tentatively-Sanskrit as an integrating force of
Indian Languages mostly focusing on the unity in diversity among them.Hope you are also attending.  
with regards.  
Dash.
