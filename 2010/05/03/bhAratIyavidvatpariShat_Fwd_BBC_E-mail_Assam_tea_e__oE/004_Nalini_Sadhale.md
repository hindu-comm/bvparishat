Dear Saroja,  
Thanks for the communication.  
I am sure you know about Vrikshayurveda. There Surapala has recommended KUNAPAJALA as a manure for all plant-species and has given useful information on several other techniques for plant nourishment and protection. AAHF Secunderabad published the book and also encouraged persons like Iyengarya in taking up further research and experiments on the same.. The tea estates in the north experimented with the techniques on a large commercial scale and were saved from destruction caused by chemical fertilizers.  
Recently bbc gave publicity to the organic tea of India. Dr. Nene had sent me a copy and I thought I could share it with the Sanskrit/Science lovers of bvp and there you are.  
If you want any further details I will gladly respond to the queries.I am attaching the publication catalogue of AAHF for some more details.  
Best wishes,  
Nalini Sadhale
