Dear All,  
Namaste.  
You may be aware of the existence of Surapala's Vrikshayurveda, published by the Asian Agri-History Foundation, Secunderabad in 1996.  
The Tea Eastates of India are actually applying some methods and producing organic tea. I am sure you will be happy to read this success story of the practical application of our ancient science in the present times.
