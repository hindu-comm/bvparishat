Dear Prof. Bhattacharya,

  

I appreciate your writing on the issue. However, unless one of us (= all the membership of the list) is a true expert capable of evaluating the various reports objectively (after acquiring information about how they came to be written), there is not much to be gained by simply reproducing the various reports.

  

North America is increasingly (but still inadequately) becoming aware of how "scientific" reports are sponsored by various industries (frequently with immediate or distant vested interests) and how the need for funding compromises the integrity of (even the university) scientists (this is not to say that there are no truly independent researchers or the bodies evaluating the reports are always influenced by vested interests; fortunately the situation is not that bad; the point rather is that one should not immediately trust this or that report).

  

I do not know which interests, if any, may be behind the varying reports we read about the use of mobile phones. Nor do I have the time to determine the reality even on an individual basis. But I do not discount the possibility that the situation could be like the one in the case of beneficial effects of consuming red wine moderately. (I am not suggesting that the list should discuss this other issue.) Secondly, the very fact that conflicting reports are coming from seemingly scientific sources minimally indicates that one side does not think that the other side has followed a satisfactory method. More fundamentally, I cannot figure out how experimental scientists would separate the effects of mobile phone vibrations \*in an exclusive, conclusive way\* when so many different waves, some under the control of scientists and some not, are passing though our body (inclusive of the brain) every moment. Perhaps someone defending the possibility of doing such a determination and explaining the procedure in terms that most of us could understand will be offering this list something truly educational.

  

With regards,
