Dear Dr. Sharma,

  

On the subject of undesirable effects of cell phones one gets many conflicting statements. If the statements are not coming from your own research, you should specify the authors of the research or your source with all available details. Secondly, since the subject is not directly relevant to the concerns of the list, it would be better simply to provide a link. (I respect your wish to be helpful to the co-workers in the field, but attribution-less reporting should not be done, especially in fields where publicity media are manipulated for monetary gain.)
