I am a student of Manuscriptology.I can read Samskrita manuscripts of  
Grantha, Kannada, Telugu, Malayalam, Nandinagari and Tigalari. I can  
edit the works according to strict Manuscriptological discipline. I  
myself can type the stuff in computer, prepare lay out work and make  
coverpage design.  
Is there anybody who needs my service?
