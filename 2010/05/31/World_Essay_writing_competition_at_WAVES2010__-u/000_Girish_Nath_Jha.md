In Collaboration with Center for Indic Studies, UMass Dartmouth, USA  
  
Invites original Essays for ESSAY-WRITING COMPETITION on  
Topic: "Was Ancient India really scientifically challenged?"  
(Word Limit: - 2500-3000)  
as part of  
Eighth International Conference on  
“Vedic knowledge for Civilizational Harmony”  
  
August 4-7, 2010  
University of West Indies, St Augustine Campus, Trinidad and Tobago  
  
Eligibility: Students from High School to Post Graduate levels  
Note on Essay Topic: The common belief among western scholars today is that other than brief stints by Ancient Greeks and Egyptians, Europe (after the enlightenment period) was the only source of scientific development for the world. Though this has been the traditional belief, facts are now emerging about Ancient India's great achievements in the fields of Astronomy, Mathematics, Irrigation, Architecture, Town Planning, Medicine and other areas.  
The essay must focus on areas that are verifiable or relatively easy to claim. Areas like those in science that just occupy a mention in Ancient texts like 'missile technology’ in the Mahabharata' , but are hard to verify should not be the highlight of any submission.

3} Writers/participants can be up to 27 years of age  
4} Marks will be awarded for originality, content, layout and presentation.
