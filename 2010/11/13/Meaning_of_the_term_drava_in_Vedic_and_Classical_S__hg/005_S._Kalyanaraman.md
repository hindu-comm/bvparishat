That's right, Prof. Ramanath ji.

  

The vivid context of the usage of upa-dra, is soma processing as explained in Chandogya Upanishad and other explanatory tracts of the yajna. In the absence of other contextual references, how to explain upa-drava or ni-dhana? We seem to have a handle on upa- and ni- prefixes.

  

Yes, you are right. The entire Rigveda is in darkness without our comprehending the 'meaning' or 'semantics' of soma.

  

dhanyavaadaah.
