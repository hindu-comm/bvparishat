I think the exact term is निधन not the निघन . Here I am quoting two  
concept one is vedic and other is from classical literature. I found  
while I was looking in website. The gist is as follows

I. The “nidhana” of the saman repeated by all priests. yajamana and  
his wife at three places on their way to reservoir of water. Yajamana  
and wife enter water, rub each other's back. Handful of kusa thrown in  
avabbrfcha isti. Purodasa offered to Varuna and then to Agni and  
Varuna. The unnetr brings out yajamana, wife and priests. They offer  
fuel sticks. The Udayanlya isti ( concluding ). Anubandhya rite  
( offering of a barren cow to Mifcra and Varuna ) or only payasya.  
Then five offerings called Devika to Dhatr, Anumati, Raka, Sinlvall  
and Kuhu. Udavasanlya igti like punaradheya. Theories about the  
identity of the soma plant and its relation to the moon. In the Deccan  
a substitute called \* ransera ' is employed for soma.

I. nidhana is from NIDHI "A treasure." Nine treasures belonging to the  
god Kuvera. Each of them personified or has a guardian spirit, which  
is an object of worship among the Tantrikas. The nature of these  
Nidhis not clearly understood. Wilson on verse 534 of the Megha-duta,  
collected works, iv. 372. Their names are Kachchhapa, Mukunda, Nanda  
(or Kunda), Kharba, Makara, Nila, Sankha, Padma, and Maha-padma. The  
Nidhis are called also Nidhana, Nikara, and Sevadhi.

In this regard I want to state that the semantic studies in Sanskrit  
is quite different from western concept. In fact, exact semantic  
studies is almost impossible in the absence of particular context.  
However we can present a semantic studies of a particular word in the  
context of conduct or cultural aspect, thinking and expression of the  
speaker and the hearer.  
Thanks
