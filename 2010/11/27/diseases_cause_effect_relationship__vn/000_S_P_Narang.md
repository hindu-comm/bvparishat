We generally find in logic that the effect has the relatiion to cause. Following  
this doctrine, medicinal treatises also search the plants for the disease.  
Nature generally generates the symptoms before the disease. It may apply to  
medicinal plants as well. due to lack of observation, we do not predict them. I  
have observed that nature gives the medicinal plants before the disease in the  
garden or in the jungle. My question is: does our any Sastra comments on the  
coming diseases on the basis of the growth of plants? It can serve the  
preventive purpose against the coming diseases. Our Sastras particularly  
Vaisesika or the works of Ayurveda must have spoken of this problem. If the  
honourable learned scholars can give any clue to the reference of the text, it  
can serve a good purpose for the welfare of the humanity including fauna and  
flora. Regards, spnarang
