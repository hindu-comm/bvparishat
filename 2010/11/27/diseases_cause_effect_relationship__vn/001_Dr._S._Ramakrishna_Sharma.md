नम: परम ऋषिभ्यो नम: परम ऋषिभ्य:,  
This is to narrate an experience  
related to the topic presented here.  
I used to visit an Ayurveda College  
to address the students on experiential learning  
and performance research in the field of Ayurveda.  
One of the students shared his interesting observation  
as follows.  
He mentioned that he found the herbs required to treat  
his patients during his training period in the surrounding  
areas of the residences of them. His derivation is that usually  
the remedy is, more often than not, available always where  
the patient resides. Of course this cannot be true, obviously  
in the concrete forests(cities and towns).  
He gave examples of stomach pain, common cold, head ache,  
asthma(vasaka plants always in the surroundings), and a few  
more.  
However, without consistent systematic documentation it would  
be rather naive to draw conclusions, indeed.  
Soon I will find out his e-mail id and forward this post to him,  
though my contact with him had gone to sleeping memory since  
7 years, after he left for PG studies.  
In the Siddha System of Medicine it mentioned that the vaidya  
himself has to gather the herbs meant for his patient. Perhaps,  
there lies the clue. The Director of Agasthya Research Centre, Mysore  
will be presenting his paper in the Conference in Jan. 2011(coordinated  
by me). I will discuss this interesting topic with him.  
Thanks for the opportunity.  
धन्यो'स्मि।
