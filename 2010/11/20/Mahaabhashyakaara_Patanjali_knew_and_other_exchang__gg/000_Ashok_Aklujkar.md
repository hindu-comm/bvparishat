Please quote only that part of an earlier message to which you are responding.

Please specify by name the person to whom you are responding.

If you take some part of history as absolutely settled -- no longer open to question (for example, Bhaasa's being later than Pata;njali or vice versa), pl give arguments in support of that position or refer to published literature as precisely as possible. This list should not become a place simply for airing what one prefers or reiterating what has already been expressed. Time is (or at least should be) valuable to all of us.

Thanks.
