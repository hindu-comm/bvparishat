Respected Scholars,Namaskar!



As usual explanation of Nidhana by Dr. S.Korada is full of details. This is so nice. Thank you very much. Now I am waiting for your explanation of "Upadrava" in the context of Saama Veda chanting.



And whenever you get time, please explain connection between Drava (liquid) and Dravya. Dravya is used in Sanskrit grammar, in MImAnsAand used by others in many different contexts. If I am right, it is mentioned at two places in your book (Theories of Language) (1) Dravya, SanskAra and Karma on page 18 and (2) Dravya as substance in the article on Medicines. Are Dravya and Sattva synonyms? In what context?



My theory: All meanings of Dravya somehow should be connected to the meaning of Drava. Of course the meaning of Upadrava should be connected to the meaning of Drava. Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
