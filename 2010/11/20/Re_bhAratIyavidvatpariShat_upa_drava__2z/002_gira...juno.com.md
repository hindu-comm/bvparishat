Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



Thanks Dr. S. Korad. You are right on "NidhAna"

Here I am giving better context.





SAma Veda chanting



PrastAva-It means Prelude. It is chanted by PrastotA priest facing west



UdgItha-It means Chant. It is chanted by UdgAtA priest facing north



PratihAra-It means Response-It is chanted by the PrahartA priest facing south



Upadrava-It means “ ? “ It is chanted by the UdgAtA priest



NidhAna-It means Finale-It is chanted by all.



What is the meaning of “Upadrava” here? Now context is given.



There are two ways to know it-(1) From the priest of SAma Veda who knows it or expert in Vedic music

Or (2) guessing from meanings of “Upa” and “drava”. Thanks. N. R. Joshi.
