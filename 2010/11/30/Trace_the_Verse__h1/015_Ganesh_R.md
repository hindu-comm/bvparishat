namO vidvadbhyaH,  
  
I am very glad that so many scholars have enthusiastically coming out with their views and sources on this issue. The famed verse 'jAnAmi dharmam"'s correct AThaH is as given by Prof. K.S. Kannan. And it's source is from pANDavagItA as he him self has mentioned. The verse no. is;57. However this verse is cited in many other texts also. Even in the mahAbhAratas rendered in various regional languages of India (ex. Kumaaaravyaas's work in kannada ) we find the very import of this verse in the words of duryOdhana.  
  
Coming to the verse "bhaagyavantam", it is quoted in
'samayOchitapadyamAlikA', an anonymous author's small collection of epigrammatic verses in the alphabetical order published by the famed nirNayasAgar press.  
  
However we have to search for these verses in the interpolations of the critical text of mahAbhArata published by the BORI, Pune.  
  
I have a doubt regarding the source of the famous statement; tEna vinA tRNamapi na chalati. I request the learned lore to dispel my ignorance in this regard.  
  
regards  
  
ganesh
