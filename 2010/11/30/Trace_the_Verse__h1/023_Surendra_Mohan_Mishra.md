**Esteemed Scholars,  
This is the very version with "tvayA hrishikesha hridi sthitena" we are used to chant at the end of sandhyA along with other devotional verses.I think the twist in the 3rd pAda is purposefully done to suit the devotional context.A kind of adaptation ! Otherwise "kenApi devena hridi sthitena" etc by Duryodhana is hypocritical which has been replied to in the YogavAsishTha.**  
**Regards,S M Mishra**
