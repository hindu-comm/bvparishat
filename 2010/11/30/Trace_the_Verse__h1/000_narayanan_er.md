Respected Scholars,  
1. Where from we trace the famous verse-part that I heard: भाग्यवन्तं प्रसूयेथा मा शूरं मा च पण्डितम्। I don't know whether I quote it correctly or not. Sorry, if I memorized it wrongly.  
2. Where from we trace the famous verse-part that I heard: जानाम्यधर्मं न च मे निवृत्तिः। etc.  
Please reply, those who knew the source of the verses in detail. Thanks.  
Narayanan
