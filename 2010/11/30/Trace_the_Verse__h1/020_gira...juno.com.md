Respected Scholars , Namaskar!



From Shree Ganesh



"However we have to search for these verses in the interpolations of the critical text of mahAbhArata published by the BORI, Pune.



I do not understand what is meant by "interpolations of the critical text of Mahabharata published by BORI"



Are interpolations listed in the critical edition? Have anybody studied the nature of these interpolation? Are they trivial or critical? Critical in the sense-do they change general understanding of the public about Mahabharat radically? Some scholars have expressed doubts on existence of even Pandava brothers?



My research shows both Hastinapura and Indraprastha were not located within the territory of the subcontinent. I am saying this because the main parties in thedispute were concentrated in the ancient time on the border between the lands of modern Pakistan and Afghanistan. Please remember at the time of Mahabharat there were no nations of Afghanistan and Pakistan.Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
