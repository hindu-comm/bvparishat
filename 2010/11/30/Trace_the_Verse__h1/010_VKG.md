Pranaam

The Verse

भाग्यवन्तं प्रसूयेथा मा शूरं मा च पण्डितम्।  

शूराश्च कृतविद्याश्च मम पुत्रा वनं गताः।।

This is a verse from Ekachakram - Drama, published by Sura Saraswati  
Sabha. The Drama is written by a single scholar or a group of  
scholars.

The context is that, Kunti and her sons are tenants and the house  
owner's household lady comes to Kunti, to seek blessings of elders  
during pregnancy.

The refrain of Kunti is that, Valour and Erudition are of little use,  
unless accompanied by Fortune; as her valiant sons are in misery in  
spite of their virtues.

--  
जानाम्यधर्मं ....  
Duryodhana's words are not to be found in Maha Bharata Main text; but  
in ancillary text.  
यथा प्रवृत्तोस्मि (अन्तर्भावित णिच्) is the version, known to us.
