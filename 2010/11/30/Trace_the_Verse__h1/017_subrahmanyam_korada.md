Sorry , I missed to answer Dr Raghavendra -

yes, the last line does not conform to the meter . Also , difficult to  
answer - when VAsudeva is available outside why to go for inner  
VAsudeva ? If no trust in the outer one same is the case with inner  
one also .  
So it is my opinion that the 3rd and 4th lines are not preferable .
