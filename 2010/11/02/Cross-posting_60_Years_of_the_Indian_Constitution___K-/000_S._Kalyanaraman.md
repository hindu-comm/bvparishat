Dear Colleagues  
  
A special issue of the Indian journal, \_Seminar\_, #615, November 2010, is just out. It's on 60 Yrs of the Indian Constitution, 1950-2010, and I  
commissioned and guest-edited it. It will go online here over the course of  
the month:  
  
[http://www.india-seminar.com/semframe.html](http://www.india-seminar.com/semframe.html)  
  
It has some excellent contributions, from both authorities on India's  
constitutional and legal history, as well as a new generation of scholars  
who work onconstitutional theoryand comparative constitutionalism inSouth  
Asia. The highlight of course is a note form Granville "Red" Austin himself  
-- the grandfather of constitutional studies inIndia!
