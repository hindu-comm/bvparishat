*November 2, 2010*



 An interesting article though it contains some historical errors. For example, the Protestant Reformation was not the first schism in Christianity. It was preceded by the breach between Rome and Constantinople followed by the Fourth Crusade. Then there was the breach in Rome itself leading to a rival pope in Avignon.



 Still itgives agood perspective.



 In the *Yaksha-Prasna* ('Questions of Yaksha')episode of the *Mahabharata,* the Yakshaasks Yudhishtira-- "What is real tolerance?" to which Yudhishtira replies, "Real tolerance means tolerance of opposites."



 This applies to religious tolerance also, which means tolerance of atheism also.
