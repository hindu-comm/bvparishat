Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



"The story of Mother India

  

Archaeological finds from India give us glimpses of a culture uniquely at ease with itself, argues Susan Huntington

  

Susan Huntington"



In my opinion, this is useless article.



In what way this article is useful to understand Mother India? She mentioned Indus civilization from 2300-1750 BC. She mentioned drying of rivers without giving years. She did not mentioned Mahabharatand hencethere is no Krishna but Buddha and Jainas are there. She mentions no violence. Was there violence in Mahabharata-yes or no? And she adds on the top of thatnomads Indo-European Aryans entering the subcontinent after 1750 BC. She did not mentioned names of Aryan tribes. Were they nameless and nomads?



My straight forward question to Dr. Kalyanraman and other scholars who study Indus and Harappan civilization.

Question1: When did Mahabharat wartake place? Before or after destruction of Indus civilization?



Question no2: On this list Shree Arun Upadhyay and Dr. Achar have fixed epic war time around 3000 BC

Was Indus civilization prospered before 3000 BC or after 3000 BC? Was Indian Sarasvati dried before or after the epic war? Those involved in the epic war -were they Aryans or non-Aryans? By not mentioning Mahabharata, is she suggesting epic war was internal conflict between nomad Aryans and Dravidians?



Is she proposing that Epic war is a negligible episode in the history of India?



On this list there are proponents of Theory of Out of India. These aryans who migrated from India towards west, did they migrate before the epic war or after the epic war?And if aryans migrated from India, then which nomad Indo-European Aryans entering India after 1750 BC she is talking?



She is throwing some sentences praising Indian civilization and at the same time promoting Aryan invasion and neglecting Mahabharata entirely.



She is also praising Alexander. She did not mentioned the causes of retreat of Alexander-They are-his spies brought two pieces of information: (1) there is desert within INdia.If we get lost we will die without water,(2) Indian spies transformed information of Alexander to the interior kingdoms. So Magadha was collecting 5000 war elephants for fight and Taprobane was collecting 8000 war elephants. Greeks saw tough war of 200 elephants with Porus. They revolted against Alexander 2nd time. Fist time happened in Bacria because Bectrians, Madras, Panchalas were fighting Alexander in Afghanistan every step stopping his way to India (W.W. Tarn book). Yes there were Panchalas in Persian empire.



All Indians should cry that Persian Empire was destroyed by Alexander. Those rulers were ancient brothers of India and they were holding Greeks out for 200 years. Parthians were holding Rome 400 years not allowing Rome reach India.



And if Indians are so fond of non-violence of Buddha, then why doIndians glorify Chandragupta who entered Afghanistan with huge army? The power in the ancient India was always Magadha. Those who are fond of Digvijaya of Arjuna, please give me answer-did Arjuna conquer Magadha of Jarasandha-yes or no? Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
