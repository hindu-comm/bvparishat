This illustrated lecture presents the most recent discoveries of the Indus Valley Civilization in Pakistan and western India. A special focus will be on the nature of Indus urban centers based on the recent excavations as sites in Pakistan and India. Excavations in 2007 at the sites of Harappa and Ganweriwala, Pakistan, and 2008-09 excavations in India have provided new evidence on the origins urbanism, writing and trade in the Indus Valley. Other important topics will include the emergence of village cultures and eventually towns (3700-2600 BC), and the urban expansion of the Indus or Harappan Period (2600-1900 BC), and the transformation of the Indus cities (1900-1000 BC).

New discoveries on the development of writing, seals, and the use of standardized stone weights will be presented along with a discussion on Indus art, symbol and technology as well as the enigmatic undeciphered Indus script. The decline and reorganization of the Indus cities (1900-1300 BC) will also be discussed along with the gradual emergence of Indo-Aryan cultures in the northern subcontinent. Throughout the presentation the important contributions of the Indus culture to later civilizations in South Asia and other world regions will be highlighted.
