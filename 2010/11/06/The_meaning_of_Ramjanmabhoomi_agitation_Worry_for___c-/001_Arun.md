There are many fundamental issues which wipe out nationhood and basis  
of all knowledge.  
(1) Secularists insist that Rama never existed as his birth place has  
not been found. Suppose it is found. What scientific test will prove  
it to be birth place of Rama?  
(2) No house of Chandragupta Maurya, Ashoka, Chandragupta-2, Kanishka  
etc. have been found. Their stories also must be false.  
(3) A poor person or ascetic like Shankaracharya, Ramanuja, Kabir,  
Tulasidas can not build palaces-they must be non existent as per this  
logic. If it is scientific study, rules of logic must be same.  
(4) Any person making inscriptions for propaganda or records or pattas  
for false claim over land is more authentic-though we have 10 million  
false cases pending anytime for land rights. But books of unversal  
acceptance lke Bhagavata or kings whose calenders are still followed  
are fictitious like Vikramaditya and Shalivahan of Ujjain.  
(5) It is not a case of Hindu or Muslim. Rama is a national hero in  
Indonesia which has 90% muslim population. By no stretch of  
imagination Babur canbe called Indian. Shershah Suri fought foreign  
Moghuls and had expelled Humayun. His son Hakim Khan made his  
subordinate Hemachandra as head of army in Panipata-2 for Hindu-muslim  
unity against invader. Later he was a general of Rana Pratap of  
Mewar.  
(6) Akbar made himself a thorough Indian by adopting all Indian  
traditions which are disputed and denied by secularists and pseudo  
scientists-He gave exact reference to Yudhishthira Shaka for starting  
point of Din-elahi. Now there are attempts to shift date by 72 to 2200  
years. Akbar knew difference between Shaka and samvatsara which has  
been forgotten by even Panchanga makers-His Amali and Fasali eras are  
still running. Healsoknew about Vikramaditya and Shalivahana whom  
secularists have dubbed fictitious as their calenders are still in  
vogue and that is basis of dates. He also revived Chanakya's cadastral  
map system with some Persian words which is still followed in India.
