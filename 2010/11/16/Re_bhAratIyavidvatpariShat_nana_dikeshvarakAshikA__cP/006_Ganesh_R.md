Dr. Kalyanaraman mentioned about Bhaashaasama or BhaashaashleSha citrakavyas. There are plenty of such poems not only in Sanskrit and Prakrit, but also in other languages like kannada and telugu too in association with Sanskrit. I my self have composed such verses in my Avadhanams. I have a good friend of mine by name Dr. R. Sankar, who is also adept in such feats. He has a English cum Sanskrit Bbhaashaa sama chitra.verse to his credit.  
  
In the works of Rudrata(kaavyaalamkaara, Anandavardhana(Devishatakam), Bhoja(Sarasvatikanthaabharana) and a host of many treatises on poetics and chitra kavitaa we do come across such verses. I am happy that even to day such tradition is living in a few writers like me and the legacy of the early masters is continued.  
  
regards  
  
Stavadhani Dr. R. Ganesh
