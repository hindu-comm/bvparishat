Many of the vowels and consonants were compiled by grammarian on the basis of the sound and not meaning. They might have borrowed from the texts having meaning including the Agamas. slowly various sects tried to explain the meaning on the basis of the similar sound. The difference of meaning had been there. The meaning had been taken on the basis of the sound and sense. e.g. II= saprpini which was written like sarpinii.On the basis of various scripts, the meaning is explained. There had been about 25 monosyllabic lexicons which are compiled with their meaning from and a number of scholars belonging to various sects. A few words have been explained by myself in:  
a.Hemacandra's Some observations on the Ekasvarakan?a : A monosyllabic dictionary in Anekarthasangraha of Hemacandra In: Haima-Vanmaya- Vimarsa: Papers presented at the seminars on Kalikalasarvajña Hemacandracarya at Gujarat University, Ahmedabad. Gandhinagar, 1990, pp. 97-106



b.Determination of meaning in monosyllabic lexicons: In: Sanskrit- Sangita-vaijayanti. Kamlesh Kumari Kulashreshtha Felicitation Volume, 1992
