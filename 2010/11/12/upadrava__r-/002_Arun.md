Korda ji has given exhaustive grammatical derivation with a note by  
Sri R.K Shrama. Samagana aspect also has been perfectly explained as  
per the procedure. Real meaning is the general process of creation of  
world. Whole world in abstract form is called 'Rasa' (Taittiriya  
upanishad 2/7) as it is uniform like water. Creation has 3 stages-(1)  
enclosing within boundary called chhanda or Maya-forms are created  
which is Rik. (2) Separate bodies move which is called yajur. Motion  
seen from out side is of 3 types-coming closer, going farther, or  
static = moving in a circle at same distance. For 5 mahabhutas, it is  
of 15 types= 15 branches of Shukla yajur. Internal motion is not seen,  
it is Krishna gati. Re-arrangement of forms in a plane can be in 17  
ways, called Plane crystallography theorem (see Algebra by Michel  
Artin for M.Sc special paper, chapter 3). For 5 mahabhutas, it is of  
85 types. One abstract unmoving watcher is Paratpara Brahma, one of  
the 2 Suparnas which does not eat the fruit. (3) Interaction among  
bodies is by sama. A body is known beyond its boundary as some of its  
influence extends beyond its body. Sun is far, but its light reaches  
us, so we can see it. Wihout Sama, there is no knowledge of anybody,  
so Krshna says that He is sama among vedas. It is of 3 types-so Vishnu  
is called Trisama. (4) Backgound in which everything is seen is Athava  
or Brahma-Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa (3/12/8/1) gives features of each veda-  
ऋग्भ्यो जातां सर्वशो मूर्तिमाहुः सर्वा गतिर्याजुषी हैव शश्वत्।  
सर्वं तेजं सामरूप्यं ह शश्वत् सर्वं हीदं ब्रह्मणा हैव सृष्टम्॥  
As existence, there are 3 main stages-(1)Birth, (2) Growth, (3)  
death. Creation is called day of Brahma. In earth day 3 stages are,  
(1) sun rise at 6 AM, (2) noon at 12 AM, (3) sunset at 6 PM. We can  
introduce one stage on each side of highest point of noon. Then there  
are 5 stages. If we introduce 2 stages, there are 7 samas. In day of  
Brahma also, there are 14 manvantaras. 7 are rising stage. In decline  
also, same stages will come in reverse order, so they are called  
'Savarni' manus= similar form or varna.  
Meaning of upadrava is too basic which was explained by my mother who  
was just literate. Creation is from 'Rasa' or 'Drava'. Going back to  
it is death or 'nidhana'. It adjacent or near stage is upadrava (upa =  
near). This meaning is explained in detail in opening paras of Gopatha  
Brahmana. Most of commentaries of Chhandogya upanishad have explained  
this aspect, but they were not approved by Stal, so English medium  
Sanskrit scholars are hesitant to see the meaning.-Arun
