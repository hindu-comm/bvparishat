There must be some forum to stop such like attempt to finish Sanskrit. In a meeting/seminar at NCERT. where Sh. chamu Krishna Shastry gave an excellent picture of the situation, It was decided to stop such like attempts. Since then, no action has been taken from the side of scholars. India minus Sanskrit =0. Let there be a joint attempt. Regards
