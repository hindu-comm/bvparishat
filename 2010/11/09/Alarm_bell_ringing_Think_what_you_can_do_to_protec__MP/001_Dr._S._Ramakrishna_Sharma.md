नमो विद्वद्भ्य:  
\>If you are really agitated due to this circular of KVS, then endanger (?)/cause a mass agitation against it.  
Thanks for the ALARM BELL.  
***My action plan:***  
To engender mass Samskrutam awareness with time bound and well  
defined activity.  
# NFSE (Non Formal Sanskrit Education) nodal centre at Rajiv Gandhi Campus,  
Sringeri is doing good work. But there is the need to spread its activity of Samskruta  
Sambhashana Shibira in the towns like Surathkal. NITK( National Institute of Technology  
Karnataka) Campus, Govinda Dasa College and the temples in the surroundings are  
potential centres for NFSE campaign. I have been attempting to get at the right persons  
to get the starter on.  
# Samskruta Dinacharanam in the temples ought to be a must. The Aanuvamshika  
Muktesara(Hereditary Managing Trustee) of Iddya Sri Mahalingeshwara Temple,  
Surathkal has agreed to provide the venue for NFSE activities. Further action is being planned.  
# On 10th November a UGC Sponsored National Conference on Science and Technology  
in Ancient India & their Present Relevance is organized by the Dept of Sanskrit, Sahyadri  
Arts and Commerce College, Shimoga. The ALARM BELL will be resonated there loudly  
and a practical course of action will be urged by me.  
# Pro Sanskrit MLCs(Member of Legislative Council, representing the teachers)  
like Capt. Ganesh Karnik need to be aerted for necessary action and follow up.  
# How many times do I speak in Samskrutam in daily life? How do I create opportunities  
among the colleagues, students and of course, in the family?  
AWARENESS MANIFESTS ONLY THROUGH REPEATED ACTION.  
THE FUTURE OF SAMSKRUTAM IS IN OUR SUSTAINED AWARENESS.  
धन्यो,स्मि
