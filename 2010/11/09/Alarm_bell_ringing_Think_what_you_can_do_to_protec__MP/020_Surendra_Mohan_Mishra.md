" तथापि वक्तुं व्यवसाययन्तु मां निरस्त-वाणी-समया दुराधयः / "

Never ever will it be possible to replace Sanskrit education and  
Sanskrit language learning for a greater appreciation and critical  
knowledge of Indian ethos,history,culture and indigenous sciences and  
universal outlook on life.

It seems a petty and queer choice to replace Sanskrit with German.The  
persons behind such a stealthy move to marginalize Sanskrit must be  
highly shortsighted.They ought to be known and singled out for a  
logical criticism of their nefarious designs in national interest.

Knowledge of German could be a help to Sanskrit scholarship but could  
not surely replace Sanskrit.Our friends in Germany could be asked to  
write in clear unequivocal terms to the people at the helm of affairs  
as to what Sanskrit is to the world of knowledge,culture and  
civilization.

The language Secretary,Govt of India could lead a team of  
educationists to the School at Sri Aurobindo Ashram at Pondicherry  
where since years it is the practice to study four languages at the  
same time from the beginning,sometimes besides the mother tongue.The  
pupils there are some of the very best in the country.But our promised  
three-language formula is even played with to suit vested interests !

Some well-placed people quite knowing the facts are even playing to  
the tunes of the higher-ups for petty gains and in such situation  
won't come out to protest ! Ambis are always a reality to get Purus  
defeated on the banks of the Sindhu  
( Hindustan ! ).

One should not panic as one did in the Macaulay-ruled times.We  
Sanskrit-lovers have first to keep our homes in order.Let Sanskrit  
replace the 20 odd mediums of languages and certain foreign mediums in  
teaching Sanskrit in schools and colleges including the numerous  
Sanskrit institutions all over India.What exactly are we doing to  
preserve the lingua franca status of Sanskrit along with other 21  
languages in the Indian constitution ?Our real work also will be  
reflected in the census ahead.

Sanskrit is being looked upon in the world as a universal tool of  
research.The psycho-linguists have spoken of it as the best  
communicating medium that has a benign impact on our body and mind.The  
artificial intelligence fraternity has engaged with Sanskrit as it's  
potentials could transform the frontiers of computer skills in  
future.Sanskrit is our pan Indian way of thinking and way of life.The  
non-Vedic religions in the world are now tracing back their ideas and  
ideals their to some pristine sources in Sanskrit

WHY THEN WE INDIANS SHRINK AND SHIVER ON SEEING SANSKRIT AS SO AND TRY  
TO BEHAVE AS SKEPTIC ? LIKE 'MODERN' CHILDREN EAGER TO SEND THEIR  
PARENTS TO OLD HOMES ARE WE TO SEND SANSKRIT TO BE ANOTHER EXHIBIT IN  
OUR MUSEUMS ?  
WHAT GOVT OF INDIA HAS PRECISELY DONE TO PROMOTE SANSKRIT IN SPITE OF  
SEVERAL SIGNIFICANT VERDICTS BY THE SUPREME COURT TO LOOK UPON  
SANSKRIT WITH GREATER REVERENCE THAN ANY OTHER LANGUAGE ?  
THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE SANSKRIT COMMISSIONS HAVE BEEN PUT IN COLD  
BOX AND THE ATTITUDE OF 'SVALPAMAPYASYA DHARMASYA TRAAYATE MAHATO  
BHAYAAT' HAS BEEN IN PRACTICE TO WARD OFF THE GRIEVANCES OF THE TRULY  
NATIONALIST !

Let us ask the Govt of India and the state Govts to adopt universal  
and compulsory Sanskrit education from the nursery up to class 12.This  
alone can prepare the Indian child to graduate into a better and  
greater life with knowledge,wisdom,values and character.  
Otherwise we shall be only preparing a nation of educated youth to  
subserve the global economic forces creating havoc to  
sensibility,sustainable development and justice.

Today it's with the Navodaya and tomorrow it's elsewhere.We shall  
fight in piecemeal  
manner but a universal rule to put Sanskrit back in place is necessary  
to establish the connect between India and Indians ! This Mahatma  
Gandhi said very clearly and very convincingly advocated by Swami  
Vivekananda,but we need the individual and national resolve to love  
and serve Sanskrit as she is the only enlightener and unifier of India  
and the world.

Best regards,

Surendra
