Respected scholars,  
  
I am not a sanskrit scholar, I am learning Samskrit myself and with  
help of Samskrita Bharathi classes. I buy most of the Sanskrit  
magazines "Sudharma", "Chandamama", "Sambhashana Sandesha", "Vaak" and  
"Sampratham" and try to study them regularly.  
  
I too fear, introduction of German as an alternative language subject  
(in addition to Samskrit) would definitely appeal a number of children  
and move them away from Samskrita. As one of my friend puts it,  
somebody has to inform the authorities that Adolf Hitler is long  
gone(!).  
  
If there is any association formed to thwart this malicious attempt, I  
would definitely help out as much as I can. Other than that I am not  
really sure how we might counter this.  
  
Srikanth.
