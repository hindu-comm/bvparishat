Respected Professor Surendramohan Mishra Ji,  
  
I support your views. Educational Institutions limit themselves to their programs. Better such projects must be floated by a private agency or any other person interested in it. In hyd i tried to establish a FM Radio completely dedicated to Sanskrit. But, when i discussed with the experts, i learnt that without continuous support to generate contents it will gain listener-ship. The task was found to be very difficult and not possible to handle with the available staff.  
  
As you pointed out, some NGO or any other private body can undertake such projects.  
  
regards,  
shrivara
