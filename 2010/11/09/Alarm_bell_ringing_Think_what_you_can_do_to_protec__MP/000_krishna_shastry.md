Respected scholars!  
Kendriya Vidyalaya Sanghathan, in its circular to schools No.190340/German/2010/ACD/KVS-DR/EO(NK) dated 4-10-10, has said that German will be one of the optional languages along with Samskrit language from sixth standard onwards, that students will opt either one of them, and also that a German teacher will be provided if there are 30 students in a class.  
Now I will tell you how it is working in Kendriya Vidyalayas. Some time in the last week of August, the first circular came to the schools asking them to find out how many students in each class are interested to learn German and to report the same to headquarters. Naturally most of the students showed the interest. Based on that numbers, the scheme is introduced with above reference number and date. Since minimum 30 students are required to get a teacher, the Principals and other interested parties are canvassing/marketing the opportunities/advantages of learning German and covertly persuading the students to take German. I was told that in many schools, those Samskrit teachers who opposed or spoke against this scheme in the classes are warned of grave consequences (transfers to remote places!) and thus they are being silenced.  
Now understand the implications of this scheme. French and other foreign languages will follow German. Due to lack of student number for Samskrit, no Samskrit teacher will be appointed in KVs hereafter. Samskrit studies in KVS will come to an end when the present teachers retire or transferred as other language teachers, as it has happened or has been happening in thousands of Government schools all over India.  
Legally, it will be very difficult to us to go to the court since they have not removed Samskrit officially.  
It is not the time for us simply to condemn ourselves/our leaders/policy makers and escape from our responsibilities. Every one of us should act/work/do something to protect Samskrit in Kendriya Vidyalayas. We lost an opportunity in CBSE schools in 1994. We lost in Haryana Schools three years ago.(and in many more states in such a way). Today it is KVS, tomorrow others will follow the suit, in fact, according to my sources of information, same things are brewing up in many states! NCERT, Knowledge Commission and many more are covertly advocating two language formula in Secondary schools, in which Samskrit will have no place. Does it really hurt us? How to measure our amount of hurt? I understand that our ACTION is the only measure. If you are really agitated due to this circular of KVS, then endanger/cause a mass agitation against it.  
Now if every one of us to write here in this bvparishat@googlegroups, only "what I have done/what I am going to do", then I would like to say that today I have approached two Former Judges in this regard, i.e requesting them to write to the Hon Minister of HRD.  
Samskrit will be saved only when we are able to awaken the society, only then when we are able to create a loud public outcry against this.  
Awaken Bharata!!!!!
