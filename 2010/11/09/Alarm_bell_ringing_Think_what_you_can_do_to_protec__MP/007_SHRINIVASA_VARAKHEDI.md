Dear Scholars,  
  
Thanks for the alarming message. As it was pointed out by somebody we should not much re-act (which is sometimes required to protect ourselves) ; rather we should be pro-active to confront this fear. I observe as follows  
  
-- We can not close/shut our windows and doors for the fear of Strong wave. We need to protect the LIGHT - Deepa in our Puja-room.  
-- In all previous movements, Sanskrit experienced setback. We must be careful even in this situation.  
-- We must use German movement for our profit. We must think of some strategy that may find a loophole in the entire plan or project.  
-- Open public agitation will not be much effective as we have seen in recent history.  
  
WITH THIS BACKGROUND I PROPOSE..  
  
-- I think - we should make a strong case before the CBSE that Sanskrit and German have a strong cultural and historical bondage. They also share some linguistic features. Therefore, if the Gemran is taught by Sanskrit Teachers instead of separate teacher, Govt can save money. Similarly, we can also tell that German will become easy to understand if it is taught with Sanskrit background. This ensures safety for Sanskrit and new opening for Sanskrit teacher. If the argument is accepted, Sanskrit teachers must undergo some traing in German and freshers will enter with the certficate as the teacher must have Sanskrit Degree and German certificate to get the job in school. This will facilitate Sanskrit teachers an ensured job.  
  
In case you dont like something ; Change it ; If it is impossible, revise your thought about it and make your mind for it. Hence, let us try to to make the situation beneficiary for us not revealing what we want.  
  
Please take my words positively and let us work together. The leaders who have any direct approach may give mind for this proposal.  
  
regards,  
shrivara
