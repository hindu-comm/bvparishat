Namo vidvadbhyah,

It is really very sad to know of the circular about sanskrit and propogation of german. Long ago, an anti-sanskrit effort was counter-acted by filing a court case by Respected Dr. Krishan Lal of Delhi University and others, and the position of sanskrit was somewhat better afterwards. Now this new bolt to sanskrit must be averted with full force. I agree with the idea of Shrikant Jamadagni to introduce a new course on Indian culture in schools to make our children proud of their rich and excellent cultural heritage. This will also infuse the feelings of patriotism and respect for our ancestors in our students.

I dont agree with the idea of instituting scholarships to inspire students to take up sanskrit. Delhi Sanskrit Academy is giving prizes of different cash valuesto studentsaccording to their percentage in 10th class exams. But still the students take the subjects of their choice at 12th level. Even the middle path of teaching German Translations of sanskrit works will not do. Because then the french, spanish and russian languages might also get introduced along with German.

I fully support the idea of condemning the move to finish sanskrit. We sanskritists can sign a uniform memorandum throughout the world and send it to Education Minister/concerned authorities.

Rajkumari Trikha
