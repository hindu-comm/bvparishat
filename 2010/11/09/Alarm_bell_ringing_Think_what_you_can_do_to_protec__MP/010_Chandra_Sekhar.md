another humbleidea is

coming up with scholarships for those studens who go through saskritam classes in middle school and high school, certain number of students excelled will get scholarship awards of certain money, there are many organizations if asked will provide scholarship moneys including from overseas.

plus+ a recognition by certain great person or recognized at a certain great event in a year. that way it is beneficial motivating children, as well as events recognize multiplication of importance. thanks........
