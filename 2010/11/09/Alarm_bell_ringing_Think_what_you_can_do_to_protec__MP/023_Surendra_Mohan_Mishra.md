*Esteemed संस्कृतकल्याणमित्रवरेण्याः !  
  
Can we propose,morally support and technically make feasible a complete Sanskrit Channel in the audio-visual electronic media with a global coverage to beam the best in our longest living tradition : social,aesthetic,scientific and intellectual ?  
  
If this comes through the Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan,the largest-number-campus university in India,set up by the Govt of India for propagation of Sanskrit learning and research,perhaps the best thing will it be to Sanskrit to reach to the cross sections of the people around the globe and would sure fulfil a desideratum in this age of communication technology promising a knowledge society for a better world.And this can come from the Orient and her repository Sanskrit as Arnold Toyenbee surmised,not long back.  
  
Can we,for the same,also garner financial support from the liberal minded industries and business houses within the country ?  
Days of MahapadmaNanda-s are past,but where are ChaaNakyas to correct the erring Chandragupta-s in the largest democracy we have ?*  
*Are our 'own' people more difficult than the 'others' who subjugated us for about a thousand years?  
*  
**  
The Samskrit Bharati through her global network and a few other organizations are doing tremendous work to put Sanskrit in place with whatever we are left with aiming at KSHEMA and enterprising to further the language,shaastra-s and sciences with a assuring YOGA.  
Chamu Krishna Sastry has been a crusader throughout.People have more often than not run him down.He and his colleagues have been putting in their best to raise the marginalized "Sanskrit" to the live,vibrant,creative and innovative "SAMSKRITAM"(प्रयोगेणाभिज्ज्वलित आकाशदेश: शब्दः /)And this is happening with the labor of those who have chosen the difficult task and track forsaking the lure of the comforts of positions and the attendant benefits.And those learned pundits who have been ensuring "SampradAyarakshA" and "SampradAya-Vriddhi" in the traditional and modern fashions in India and abroad are our worthy heroes to emulate : " YO 'NUCAANAH SA NO MAHAAN ".  
  
WITH OUR GDP GROWING AT A BREATH-TAKING PACE,DOES SANSKRIT,AS THE PIVOT OF INDIAN AND GLOBAL CULTURE AND HERITAGE,NOT DESERVE BETTER NURTURE AND NOURISHMENT ?**
