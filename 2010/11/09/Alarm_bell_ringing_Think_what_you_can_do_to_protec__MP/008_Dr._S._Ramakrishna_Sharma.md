Respected Scholars,

As an add on idea to the excellent practical proposal presented by Sri  
Varakhedi,  
I would like to have text books like Kalidasa'a Shakuntalam in German  
translation by  
Goethe and the original juxtaposed; find out such possibilities where  
the new texts can  
act as a German - Samskrutam bridge.

Maxmuller Bhavans in the country may be approached to provide FREE  
German lessons  
to Sanskrit teachers as an incentive to take up teaching German language.

Jayatu Samskrutam. Jayatu Bharatam.
