Dear Prof. Joshi, Thanks for the information. My problem is: if the alternative Sanskrit word for Huna is known, a number of linguistic, historical, Prakrit and cultural problems of the cultural history of India can be brought to light. I think the word Huna is preserved in Sanskrit along with some other words. If any Pundit has come across the words, I will be hightly obliged to get the information. Regards, spnarang
