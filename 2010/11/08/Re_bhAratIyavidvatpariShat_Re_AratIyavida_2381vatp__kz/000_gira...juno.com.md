Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



Dear Prof. Narang,



Barbar or Berbar or Berbers,Moors and Negro Jews



In the known history (after 500 BC) Barbars were present from Libya all way to Arabia. My guess is that they were present at Mahabharat time somewhere between Arabia to Sindhu river deltas.There is one tank by name Barbar tank in Arabia. Dr. Albright of the Johns Hopkins University excavated complete temple from Arabia.A large number of inscriptions are found in Arabia.



Huns



They were known in 800 BC by name Hsiung-NU-Western Jung. Their leader devised a singing arrow. Their mention in the epic creates a lot of problem. Were they known to ancient Indians by name Hun all the time or by name Urna as described in the book of Savitri Saxena. Their known history is from 800 BC until they drove Italians in sea where Italians built Venice.



Critical Edition of Mahabharata



BORI spent many years in developing critical edition of Mahabharat Even then there are lot of problem when one finds a changed names (such as Antakhi and Roma-Yavanapuras) from the known history in the epic. Even Dr. B.B. Lal says many things were added in the epic in the known history. I do not know how to handle that. Thanks. N.R.Joshi

Sir, will you please write on the identity of Barbara as a tribe, land, caste or anything else. it is frequently referred to in the MBH and the Puranas. Please also write, if there is a reference to an alternative name of the Hunas? Regards, spnarang

Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



Ancient name of Bactria



Dear Dr. D. Bhattacarya, Thanks for your information. You are right. I do not believe many conclusions of Prof. Witzel. Now here is my information on Bactria.



From the book of Savitri Saxena

Page 104. Dr Raychaudhuri places Kurus in Vahlika (Bactria) and not within any territory in India proper. Mahabharata refers to Vahlika PrAtipeya who was the second son of the Kuru king Prateepa. He was paternal uncle of Bhees’ma. Vahlika and Madra were sister provinces. Kuru, Kamboja, Shaka, Vahlika and Madra and Stree Rajya were outside the boundaries of the subcontinent.

At the time of Mahabharat, there was no Pakistan, Afghanistan, Persia, Iran. There were kingdoms including India. Kingdom of Magadha was the most powerful because of Jarasandha.

Please understand that this information does not demote the ancient history of Mahabharata or Bharata. Behind the history of Mahabharata, the history of the whole Eurasia is hidden. Thanks. N. R. Joshi
