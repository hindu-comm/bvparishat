Sir, I have read the material of Wikipedia. My query is with regards to the synonyms of Hunas which are lost in due course of time but are preserved in sanskrit in one or the other form. Is HUUHU has any relation? the ghuurn.a may be related to preserved in ghumakkad.a in HIndi. Please help. Regards, spnarang
