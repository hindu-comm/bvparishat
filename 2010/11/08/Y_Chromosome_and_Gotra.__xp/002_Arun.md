There are 3 meanings of Gotra-(1) Tradition of knowledge, (2)  
Hereditory, and (3) marriage of woman or adoption.  
In Vedic literature, 3 sources of man's personality have been  
described. These have been explained in detail in Pitri-Samiksha by  
Madhusudan Ojha and Shraddha-vijnana in 4 vols by his student Motilal  
Sharma-Angirasa Bharadvaja. The units have been called 'Saha' at  
various places in Vedic literature. Link up to 7 generation may be  
seen in Rigveda (10/56/5, 5/3/9, etc). There are 3 types of effects -  
(1) Pinda up to 7th generation, (2) Udaka (water) up to 14th  
generation and (3) Rishi up to 21st generation.  
Sources of human personality are-  
(1) Sanskara of past lives-10 saha  
(2) Chromosomes-23 pairs =46 saha  
(3) Period in womb-28 saha by 10 rounds of moon in 28 nakshatras.  
Total are 84 saha.  
46 chromosomes will be divided into round numbers till 7th  
generation-46, 23, 12, 6, 3, 2, 1. Even 56 Sahas will be divided till  
7th generation-56, 28, 14, 7, 4, 2, 1. Division into round numbers is  
called Pinda (solid, compact) relation. Finer divisions are called  
Udaka (water) and Rishi (knowledge). Gita, chapter 1 has referred to  
Pinda-udaka kriya.  
Siddhartha Buddha was born on 31-3-1886 BC, got enlightened on  
3-4-1851 BC and expired on 27-3-1807-all on Vaishakha purnima. There  
is no indication that he ever started Gautama gotra. Rather there is  
no mention that he himself was Gautama. He was born as Siddhartha, son  
of Shuddhodana and became Buddha after reaching highest mental stage.  
In list of 28 Buddhas, Siddhartha and Gautama Buddhas are separate.  
Another meaning is that he mostly adopted verbal logic whose method  
was summarized in Nyaya sutras of Gautama, so he or the later Buddha  
might be called Gautama. There was Vishnu incarnation Buddha born as  
son of Ajina in Magadha (KIkata) who performed a yajna at mount Abu to  
unite 4 kings against Asuras (rise of Assyria in 850 BC). After that  
unification under king Shudraka, his shaka started in 756 BC (Jyotisha  
Darpana of Yallaya). That federation called Malava Gana lasted till  
Sriharsha shaka of 456 BC (Al Biruni and Abul Fazal). This period has  
been referred to as 300 years of republic by Megasthenes and Arrian-  
prior to Alexander. A note on 28 Buddhas on basis of Thupa (Stupa-  
vamsha) may be seen on [www.scribd.com/Arunupadhyay](http://www.scribd.com/Arunupadhyay). -Arun Kumar
