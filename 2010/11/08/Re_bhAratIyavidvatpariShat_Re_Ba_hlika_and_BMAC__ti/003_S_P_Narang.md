Shaakala dviipa is the area which was a geographical unit: may/may not be deviipa in its technical sense. But its relation to Sialkot is accepted by most of the scholars. The inhabitants to Shaakaladesa are known by that name. The Vedic recension and allied literature written in that are known by shaakala vis a vis Baas.kala. An appedix is given by me in the paper: A dialect of Sialkot in Panini: RV Joshi Felicitation volume:  
A dialect of Sialkot in Panini. In: Studies in Indology: Prof. R.V. Joshi Fel. Vol., Delhi, 1988-89, pp.197-210
