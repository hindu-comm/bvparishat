Respected Scholars,Namaskar!



Dr. S. Korad,



"Under 'avyayAttyap' ( 4-2-104) , Patanjali offers names of some  
VAhIkagrAmas --  
ArAt , kAstIrah , dAsarUpyam , **sAkalam** , sausukam "



This is good. There was kingdom of Shalya, brother of MAdree in Shaakala dveepa. Shakala was its capital. Remember now with Shakala Dveepa we are reaching way up in Central and Eastern Asia. We did not talk about Ural Mountains. BMAC is around the source od Ural river.



Now they found handmade pottery (not wheel made) in BMAC. My question-Is there admonition in Rigvedafor making pottery by using wheel?



My second question-Is there reference in Rigveda describing Indra with red-blond beard and hair?



There were people like that in Central Asia in the known history-Tartars having reddish hair. Thanks. N.R.Joshi.

BAhlika / BAhlIka -- BAhIka -VAhIka  
  
Amarakosa says (2-Vaisya) bAhlikam is Asaphotida / Hingu -  
  
sahasravedhi jatukam bAhlikam hingu ramatham - here the derivation is  
- the one that has come from the country - bAhlika . RAmatham means -  
the one that has come from the country  
'rama.tha .  
The other meaning of BAhlikam / BahkIkam is saffron ( from 'bahlikadesa' ) -  
Amara - 2- Manusya - kasmIrajanmAgnisikham varam bahlikapItanam  
  
Still another meaning is - the horse from "BAhlikadesa' -  
Amara - 2- Ksatriya - vanAyujah pArasIkAh kAmbhoja bAhlikA hayAh  
Amara - NAnArtha - bAhlikam rama.the'pi ca.  
  
PAninisUtram - vAhIkagrAmebhyasca (4-2-117) - KaumudI - bAhIkagrAmebhyasca .  
Under 'dityadityAdityapatyuttarapadA.n.nyah ' ( 4-1-85) -  
VArtikam - bahi.sa.s.tilopo yan(ca) ca -- bahirbhavo bAhyah .  
VArtikam - Ikak ca -- bAhIkah .  
VArtikam - Ikan(ca) chandasi -- bAhIkamastu bhadram vah .  
  
Under 'avyayAttyap' ( 4-2-104) , Patanjali offers names of some  
VAhIkagrAmas --  
ArAt , kAstIrah , dAsarUpyam , sAkalam , sausukam .  
  
The people of VAhIkadesa are considered to be 'adhamAdhikArinah' ,  
that'swhy the popular example - gauh vAhIkah , gAm pAthaya (Patanjali)  
.  
  
I do not know as what the term is that is used for Prophet Mohammad in  
PurAnas but one should be very careful in such matters --  
on 27/11/2008 (significant)I was invited by a Muslim Organization to  
represent Hindu Religion  
(also someone to speak on Christianity) . The Muslim speaker quoted  
Ravisankar and said  
that a Sanskrit word in Vedas (all) refers to Mohammad and there were  
so many such Prophets  
earlier , i.e. since time immemorial .  
Pundit Ravisankar should have not said so .
