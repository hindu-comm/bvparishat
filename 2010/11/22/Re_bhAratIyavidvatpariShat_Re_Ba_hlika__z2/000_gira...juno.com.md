Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



Dr. Deepaka Bhattacharya



{But it was never the coveted land for the Vedic people. The soldiers left by retreating Alexander might have somewhat changed the landscape when the actual iron-age history of Bactria began. Any golden age of Bactria before that, and even after, has to be regarded as myth.}

Please give us approximate date of compilation of Atharveda. And what is meant by Vedic people? Not all Vedas are composed at the same time. PLease correct me if I were wrong. For Atharveda Bahika land was far away.

Time of Alexander is around 326 BC when he destroyed Persian Empire. Long before 326 BC Daurious was showing swords imported from India to his mother. These were made of special steel (Pohalad from Pokkhalavat). Iron ore is plenty in India from very ancient time until now (27 trucks full of Iron ore were lined up in Bellary area port to export illegally ---news ). **I published a research paper on "Tough Steel of Ancient India**". So if Persians knew swords, then Bactrians also knew and hence iron and steel.

Last week I met Arab scholar from Kuwait. I asked him Arabian word for steel. He said Pulad. Russians call it Bulad. All over Asia from the ancient time Indian steel as known as Pulad from the ancient Pushkaravati. The champion of Islam Saladin in middle ages had Damascus sword. It was hammered in Damascus but steel bars came from India. Indian special steel swords were called Jawab-i-Hind in the middle ages.

In the known history 500 BC to 326 BC, Bactria was jewel of Iranian land. Ancient irrigation system was there and hence in that area was Venice of Asia, 400 miles long.

I was discussing that Bactria is ancient Vahlika of Mahabhararta. However I do not know exactly time of Mahabharat. I believe it was before 1350 BC time of Hittites and Mitanni. Thank. N.R.Joshi
