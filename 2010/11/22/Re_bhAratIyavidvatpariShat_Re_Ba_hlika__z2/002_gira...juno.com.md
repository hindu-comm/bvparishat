Respected Scholars, Namaskar!

Certain words were missing. So I am reposting my article. Please pardon me.



Dear Dr. D. Bhattacharya, Namaste!



Please do send your papers. I am ready to read. I am open for different views. One has to upgrade his knowledge all the time.



In my Mahabharat book, there are 300 references. The majority is from the western scholars. Western scholars themselves describe that people were moving from Asia to Europe.Origin of Aryansin Carpathian mountains was ruled out long ago. The center of origin based on archeology is shifted to the area of Ural mountains. The present theory-one branch went to the western Europe, other to central Asia. From there to Iranian land-branched to India. This is only rough picture.



Both theories -Out of India Theory(OIT) and Invasion of India Theory (AIT) do not explain all facts. We needThird Model of the history of ancient India. Here I found the history of Mahabharat useful. Because I was reading about Aryans coming to the subcontinent from the west, the first thing I did is to enter into the ancient history of Afghanistan. Then I continued exploring the ancient history of all countries in the west all way up to Finland in the west and Sinkiang province of China in the east. It was wonderful mental journey. The journey resulted in my book-Evidence of Mahabharat from outside of the subcontinent.Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
