It is not a question of ardhavisarga but a matter of pronunciation which is  
changed before kavarga and pavarga only. For Kavarga, it is equivalent to Q in  
English and Kwaf in Persian and Urdu which are mixed with K and difficult to be  
known even by experts. Similar is Pavarga. Perhaps, once they were spoken  
similar. That is why Pippilikaa in Sanskrit changes to Kippilikaa in Prakrit. Go  
in English and Po in Tamil have some connections. for details: : Wackernagel:  
Altindische Grammatik. Vol. I. To a number of Sanskrit grammarians, it was only  
a form written before k and p. Regards, spnarang
