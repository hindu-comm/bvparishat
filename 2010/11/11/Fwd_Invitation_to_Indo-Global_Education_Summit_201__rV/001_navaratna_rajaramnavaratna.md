Dear Sri Chaitanya:



 Looks like a most interesting program, but unfortunately I will be returning to India too late to attend.



 I am currently associated with the Center for Indic Studies, University of Massachusetts and also the 3Rs Foundation and its American Vivekananda Academy located in Dartmouth, Massachusetts.



We are organizing a Youth Workshop on **Science and Vedanta in Today's World** for July 5, 2011 in Dartmouth, MA.



 This will be followed by the Annual Vedanta Conference on July 6 and 7 organized by the Center for Indic Studies. Its theme for 2011 will be **Vedanta and Modern Science: How can the twain meet?**



**** This is for your information and will be followed by updates for those interested.



Sincere regards,

N.S. Rajaram
