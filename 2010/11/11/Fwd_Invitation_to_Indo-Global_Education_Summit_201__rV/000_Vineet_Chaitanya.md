Dear Dr. Siddhartha Datta,  
  
Invitation to Indo-Global Education Summit 2010  
  
Greetings and good wishes.  
  
The Indus Foundation is pleased to invite you and your institution to participate in the Indo-Global Education Summit 2010 on academic collaborations. The Summit will be held at Marriott Hotel & Convention Center,Hyderabad, India from December 3 to 5, 2010.  
  
As you are aware, Indian educational system has been undergoing a paradigm shift in the recent past. Indiahas the world's second largest post-secondary student population of around 13 million. It is expected that this number will get doubled over the next 12 to 15 years. Further, the Indian economy is transforming into an international powerhouse requiring India to provide the best possible educational opportunities for its citizens. In the face of a growing demand for post secondary education and limited capacities, India is keen to bridge the anticipated gap, by improving the quality of its own higher education with the help of reputable foreign universities, while enhancing capacities.

The Summit 2010 will have sessions on Engineering & IT, Business & Management, Life Sciences & Biomedicine, Natural Sciences, Arts & Humanities, and Social Sciences.
