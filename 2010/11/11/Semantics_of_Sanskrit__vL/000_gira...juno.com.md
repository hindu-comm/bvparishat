Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



Meaning of "Upadrava".





In Saamaveda chanting, we have (1) PrastAva,(2)UdgIta,(3) PratihAra, (4) Upadrava, and (Nidhana). From the book "discovering Vedas" by Dr.Frits Staal.



What is the meaning of "Upadrava" here? Any relation to the meaning "trouble" as understood generally of this word? Thanks. N.R.Joshi
