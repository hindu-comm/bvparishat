*November 11, 2011*



 What Mr. P.C. Alexanderfails tosee is that Ramachandra Guha is less an objective historian than a court chronicler of the Nehru-Gandhi clan. To go with it, Guha has an extreme aversion to anything remotely Hindu as Sardar Patel undoubtedly was. He is a product of the Valson Thampu Convent in Delhi, aka St Stephen's College.



 Guha has the habit of refering to Hindus, especially the Sanghas followers of Surya Namaskar, though being totally humorless fails to see himself in similar light as a practitioner of **SONIA NAMASKAR.** Why should he, when his *Sonia Namaskar* has proved so profitable while those who do *Surya Namaskar* (supposedly including myself) have no material gains to show for it? (For the record, I still play squash and while a student in the U.S., I represented my college both in tennis and golf, but Guha and his tribe cannot see beyond stereotypes, even when it comes to a towering figure like Patel.)



 In leaving out Patel, one can be sure that Guha wasbeing faithful tothe wishes -- expressed or implicit -- of his patrons and masters.



 As far as Patel is concerned, his place in history is secure; he has no need of a certificate from any small time courtier posing as a scholar. The Indian history establishment today is dominated that peculiar breed of 'historians' (should we call them 'distorians') that has prospered in post Independent India, who are more advocates and propagandists than objective scholars. We saw them in full display over the Ayodhya dispute, and over the Aryan Invasion earlier. In fact, my next book will be on this theme-- *Aryan Invasion to Ayodhya: The infamous journey of famous historians.*



 Regrettably, there are no historians today of the caliber of R.C. Majumdar, Jadunath Sircar and their colleagues of fifty years ago.



 Why this degeneracy? Shakespeare put it best, in describing why Hamlet's mother married Claudius so soon after her husband's death:



 *Thrift, thrift, Horatio, the funeral bak'd-meats  
 Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.*
