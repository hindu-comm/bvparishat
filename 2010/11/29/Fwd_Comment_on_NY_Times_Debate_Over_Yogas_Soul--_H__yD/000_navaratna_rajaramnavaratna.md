 Here is my posting on the NY Times. Now this has come out in the open, we must hammer the point home and take advantage of it.



 I want to compliment the Hindu American Foundation, Dr. Aseem Shukla in particular for opening this debate.



 Could someone please forward this to Dr. shukla, I don't seem to have his id.

**Vedic origins of Yoga and Hinduism  
  
**Yoga and Hinduism both trace their origins to ancient texts known as the Vedas which are of untold antiquity. I have seen ASANAS (as Yogic postures are called) in Indian archaeological remains that are 5000 years old.  
  
Yoga is more than breathing and physical exercises though they are the best known part in the West. Yoga also includes metaphysics and theories of knowledge and proof. Much of it has been codified in an ancient Sanskrit text known as the YOGASUTRA ('Principles of Yoga') attributed to Patanjali. It is part of the Hindu canon.  
  
As the author of several books on ancient India, I am struck by the dismissive tone of Dr. Deepak Chopra whom the article rightly calls a New Age Writer. He is not a scholar, knows no Sanskrit, the sacred language of Hinduism, and has no competence to comment on its history or philosophy. He is a pop philosopher who borrows its symbols to market his books and himself. He has written also about the Buddha, Jesus and Prophet Mohammed though he is no more a scholar in these fields than in Vedic Hinduism.  
  
So it is clear that Chopra's priority is marketing, not historical accuracy. Let us accept the fact that Yoga like Hinduism is part of the Indian Vedic tradition and enjoy its benefits. It excludes no one but cannot be the monopoly of a pop philosopher's commercial interests.
