*November 3, 2010*



 This is only part of the story. The real concern of Sonia and her family is the threat posed by the Jihadi organizations. She fears the Jihadis, but needs the Hindus to protect her and her family. It is to keep the Jihadis at bay that Sonia and now Rahul periodically attack Hindus and Hindu organizations. In short, they are yielding to blackmail.



 I have written about it several times in Indian as well as U.S. publications. In fact my two part article ***Sonia Gandhi's Reluctant War Against Terror*** appeared in the web magazine ***The American Thinker*** years ago. It may be worth resurrecting now.

  

Has anyone heard Sonia, Rahul, or even Manmohan Singh mention the word **Jihad** in public?



 Vatican is a Red Herring. I see Sonia as a tool of Jihadis. She and the government didn't make much noise when the Hindusreacted to conversions strongly. I was part of a major public program in Bangalore against conversions. But now, with international heat being turned on Islamic terrorists, Sonia and her government have launched an all out attack against the Hindus and Hindu organizations, **including the armed forces**.



 Why aren't these self-styled Hindu intellectuals and spokesmen engaged in self-promotion raising this issue? What are they afraid of?

*STATEMENT OF DR.SUBRAMANIAN SWAMY, PRESIDENT OF**JANATA PARTY MADE IN CHENNAI ON 03.11.2010*

  

1.The Home Minister Chidambaram’s inane comment on ‘Hindu Terror’ acts is actually a Home Ministry project of 2004-06.With the explicit approval on exercise of her extra-constitutional authority Ms.Sonia Gandhi had instructed the then Intelligence Bureau Director to recruit army, Hindu sadhus and sadhvis on the call of ‘patriotism’ and thus motivated them to commit acts of terror to polarize the Muslim community against Hindus.

  

2.In 2007, Ms.Gandhi ordered the termination of this clandestine operation that she had ordered in 2004.She then used the project to discredit the Hindutva movement by targeting innocent and unsuspecting persons, focussing on RSS persons.

  

3.The framing of the Kanchi Shankaracharya in the Sankaraman murder case was also on the instruction of Ms.Sonia Gandhi to Ms.Sasikala.Ms.Jayalalitha the then CM, being a performing ‘circus lion’ in front of the ‘ring master’ Ms.Sasikala, obliged and hence the Shankaracharya was arrested.

  

4.The foreign Christian missionary lobby has been against the Shankaracharya because he had tried to co-opt Scheduled Castes and Backward Classes into the Hindutva movement.

  

5.I therefore welcome the RSS decision to launch a nation wide agitation to expose this slandering and framing of Mr.Indresh Kumar, and the RSS as an organization.

Statement of Dr. Subramanian Swamy made in Kochi on 3 Nov. 2010

  

The vicious attack on the RSS by Ms. Sonia Gandhi yesterday at the captive Congress Party meeting is now making clear to all Indians her true form. Like Ravana who came dresssed as a Sadhu in saffron colour clothes to fool Sita to let down her guard, so that he could kidnap her, in the same way Ms. Gandhi came dressed in a saree, even covering her head on occasions as a good bahu (daughter in law) would, and fooled Indian people to enable her to steal the raj simhasan;

  

  

Yesterday at the meeting, she was speaking in her true form, as a foreign Christian missionary agent of the religious conversion violence against Bharat Mata, and hence seeking to defame the RSS with a contrived charge of terrorist activities.

  

RSS is a voluntary organization of patriotic Hindus who want to rise above petty caste and regional loyalties, and hence a sheet anchor in the battle against cash-induced religious conversion of which Ms. Gandhi is the patron in India.

  

She is now seeking to shackle India so that the Vatican can enjoy suzerainty over Sanatana Dharma and Hindustan.

  

I urge all genuine Hindutvavadis to throw off all their shackling inhibitions and join in a grand democratic onslaught on this covert, clandestine, and cancerous invasion against the most ancient and continuing value system of India that was made known to us Indians as Hindutva by Swami Vivekananda and Veer Savarkar, and given an all India organisational content by the RSS. For the sake of a Virat Hindustan I appeal to all patriotic Indians to defend the RSS with all the resolve that they can muster.

  

Subramanian Swamy.
