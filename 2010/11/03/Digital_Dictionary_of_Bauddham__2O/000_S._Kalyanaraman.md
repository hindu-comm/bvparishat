A splendid initiative and a dedicated effort to document Bauddham, spanning Sanskrit, Pali and other sources.

Major Technical Upgrade of CJKV-E/DDB Dictionaries  
\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*  
From:Charles Muller\<[acmu...@jj.em-net.ne.jp]()\>  
  
Dear Colleagues,  
  
After almost ten years of operation since Michael Beddow's initialcreation of the programming structure for the online CJKV-E/DDB  
dictionaries, we are delighted to announce a major upgrade of theseweb services.  
  
The most basic components of this upgrade are (1) a move to adedicated server which will be able to deliver more power to search  
functions and greater stability to Unicode-related programming, and(2) an entire rewriting of the underlying search and indexing  
routines, resulting in a noticeable increase in speed and variety ofsearch results, and links to both internal and external  
resources. Some major specific additions and enhancements include:  
  
A. Basic Search  
  
 (1) A middle-level of search results, showing a list of head wordsthat contain the search term. Previously, searches for a term would  
 produce only the headword itself (when it existed), along with along, scattered list of entry body matches.  
  
  
 (2) The list of body entry matches, which was previously deliveredwithout any particular ordering, is now sorted according to  
 traditional ascending radical + stroke count (basically equivalentto Unicode hex number).  
  
 (3) The list of matched body entries now includes a snippet ofcontext, to give the user some hint of the usefulness of each  
 listed match.

  
 (4) Head word searches via Pinyin, Hangeul,Korean romanization,Katakana, and Japanese romanization. Previously, searches for  
 headwords via their various renderings in East Asian and romanizedsyllabaries would only yield matches as body entries. Now,  
 dedicated search indexes for Pinyin, etc. will yield head wordmatches in a very fast search.  
  
 (5) Searches with or without diacritics are equally andtransparently supported. Searches employing those romanization  
 systems that use diacritics may also be made with or withoutdiacritical marks(though in the nature of things the latter may  
 produce some false positives). This also applies to searches forSanskrit and Pali terms in entry bodies.  
  
  
B. Entry results  
  
 (1) Previously, hyperlinks to terms within displayed entriessometimes lacked actual targets, or led to the comprehensive  
 external index in a roundabout manner. Now, if a term currently hasno target in the dictionary concerned or (in the case of the DDB)  
 in the external index, it will be shown without a hyperlink.  
  
 (2) If the link goes to the comprehensive external index ratherthan the DDB itself, the user will be taken directly to that  
 information, with no other message or page in between.  
  
 (3) If the headword of a DDB entry is also present in the CJKV-E,a hyperlink to that entry will automatically be added to the DDB  
 entry when it is displayed. The converse applies to CJKV-E entriesif the DDB has an entry for the same headword, a link to it will be  
 added to the CJKV-E entry on the display.  
  
 (4) A link for a direct search to the SAT Taish? Database willautomatically be generated for DDB entries (we are also able and  
 willing to generate links directly into other web-based canonicalcollections if the administrators of those collections are willing  
 to provide us with the requisite code for such links).  
  
  
C. Behind-the-scenes. There are other enhancements which, while not visible to users, will greatly improve the function of both dictionaries. Most importantly:  
  
 (1) The two main indexes (on headwords and fulltext) previouslyused have been completely re-implemented to give faster and more  
 flexible matching. In addition, a number of specializedsupplementary indexes have been added which are automatically  
 invoked alongside or instead of the main indexes as and whenappropriate.  
  
 (2) Index updating has been made significantly faster andextensively automated. This means that all the indexes can be  
 regenerated as frequently as desired. So from now on, correctionsto existing entries, as well as newly-contributed entries, will be  
 browsable and searchable in their entirety very shortly aftereditorial acceptance (assuming of course, that the Human in-charge  
 is not indisposed for some reason or other!).  
  
 (3) Great care has been taken to ensure that hyperlinks on externalsites to DDB and CJKV-E entries which employ the syntax of the  
 previous implementation of the Dictionaries continue to functionexactly as before. No existing external links made in accordance  
 with the methods previously specified for creating such links willbe broken as a result of the new infrastructure.  
  
  
D. CJKV-E  
  
 (1) In the process of preparing this upgrade, a great amount ofwork has been put into improving the structure and content of the  
 CJKV-E dictionary, which has stayed pretty much on the back burnerfor the past decade or so. Greater attention will henceforth be  
 given to the development of this resource.  
  
 (2) In fact, I am presently working with a small grant that willhave the effect of drastically increasing the coverage of the  
 CJKV-E over the next few years.  
  
I would like to take this opportunity to offer my deepest thanks tothose scholars who have provided staunch and enduring support for the  
DDB over the past decade. Most importantly to Michael, who has,without any monetary remuneration whatsoever, provided state-of-the  
art programming of these dictionaries (along with web security and allother related functions), buttressed by a matched level of  
understanding of lexicographical and linguistic principles that hasprovided us with so much of the structure and precision that these  
online references currently exhibit. Many of the technicalenhancements are based on Michael's work on theAnglo-Norman  
Dictionary([http://www.anglo-norman.net/](http://www.anglo-norman.net/)), funded by theArts andHumanities Research Councilof the United Kingdom, whose indirect butsignificant support is gratefully acknowledged.  
  
There is also a core group of approximately 25 scholars, many of themrecognized as leading figures in their own areas of expertise, who  
have continued to generously contribute large amounts of material fromtheir own research notes and glossaries. They have also spent muchtime in scouring previously-existent entries, amending, appending, andentirely rewriting, such that the DDB and CJKV-E are in a steady stateof growth in size and accuracy (the names of these scholars can bebrowsed at \<[http://www.buddhism-dict.net/credits/credits-ddb.html](http://www.buddhism-dict.net/credits/credits-ddb.html)\>). Iwould also like to thank those scholars who have convinced theirlibraries of the value of an institutional subscription. The resultingfunds, albeit modest, have been invaluable to help pay forinfrastructure, web hosting, and the employment of part-timeassistants to do input and editing.  
  
I believe we can say that there are few, if any, other examples in theacademic humanities field where a body of scholars, bonded by  
overlapping interests but spread across the globe, have contributed toa central resource on a such a scale, upholding rigorous standards ofcomposition, accreditation, and citation, and providing an eminentlypractical and useful example of how we can collaborate to build  
resources that are far more substantial than mere anonymousaggregations.
