Abstract: Languages of present-day India can be explained from a common source. *Indus Script Cipher* (2010) by S. Kalyanaraman, is premised on India as a linguistic area. Thus a list of lexemes common to all major language families of India is compiled surmising them to be derived from the common semantic -- and hence, cultural -- pool. Language is but a social contract in a cultural continuum of a civilizational area. Hopefully, the next generation of scholars will not have to repeat the refrain: “The Indus Script has not been deciphered so far…” The rebus decryption of the script occurs by matching glyphic elements of hieroglyphs of the script with homonyms from the list of lexemes. The decryption identifies a set of homonyms, all of which are related to the repertoire of stone-workers (lapidaries) and the glyphs used in their writing system. This work, evidencing the language union (*sprachbund*) contributes to historical studies emphasizing the essential cultural continuum from the days of Indus Valley (Sarasvati-Sindhu) civilization into India’s historical periods.

  

*Indian lexicon*is at<http://www.scribd.com/doc/2232617/Lexicon>which constitutes the semantic resource-base (including Vedic, Prakrit, Pali and other Indian languages) for identifying ancient homonyms of the*sprachbund*to help read rebus the glyphics of Indus script. Introduction is at<http://www.docstoc.com/docs/64000625/Indian-Lexicon-introduction>

  

On slide 3 of the Presentation is a Susa pot slide showing the interaction areas of Meluhha, Magan, Dilmun and Mesopotamia (After Maurizio Tosi, 2010). This pot has a FISH glyph inscribed on the pot. This pot contained metal artefacts. See the two slides of Maurizio Tosi (2010) at<http://www.docstoc.com/docs/63999062/sarasvatiinteractionareas>The 'fish' glyphic is a signature glyph of the civilization denoting ayas 'metal' of the Indian *sprachbund* or Indian linguistic area. Fish + crocodile is read rebus as: ayakaara 'metal smith' (Pali). Other compound attested is ayaskaanDa (Panini) which gets depicted rebus as fish + arrow or fish + four linear circumscript strokes -- together with bos indicus (zebu or brahmani bull), another signature glyph. khaaru is attested as crocodile and khaar is attested as blacksmith in Kashmiri language. The glyphic of the script represent words, not syllables or alphabets.

  

This is an evidence linking the writing system of Indus Script with the trade interactions of the civilization -- of Meluhha stone-workers, metal-workers with Susa, dated to ca. 4th millennium BCE (?) The fish glyph is rendered in a rebus reading as aya, ayo. Rebus: aya, ayas 'metal' (Indus language, meluhha/mleccha). The gloss is presented in Munda etyma compiled by the late Sudhibhushan Bhattacharya.It is apposite to record a tribute to the late Sudhibhushan Bhattacharya who initiated studies on Munda etymology , to the late Kuiper for his work on Nahali etymology and to the work of Norman Zide on Munda numerals.

(After Maurizio Tosi, 2010. Pot with metal artefacts found at Susa. Pot is painted with Indus Script 'fish' glyph).

  

Many glyphics including the crocodile + fish combination on many punch-marked coins from Gandhara to Karur of the historical periods starting from ca. 1000 BCE, an evidence of continuance of the writing system together with kharoshthi or brahmi script inscriptions. These punch-marked coins constitute the rosetta stones of the civilization together with a number of inscribed artifacts such as: the two pure tin ingots found in a shipwreck in Haifa; anthropomorph of Gangetic copper hoards; Sohgaura copper plate; Rampurva copper bolt; and Srivatsa glyph on Sanchi torana. Thus, together with cultural markers of the civilization such as wearing sindhur at the parting of the hair, worship of shivalinga, use of turbinella pyrum for bangles and trumpets, glyphics of the writing system also continued to be used in the Indian linguistic area (Indian sprachbund) during historical periods as a cultural continuum.

  

The presentation was made in three lectures in Delhi; the Indian edition of the book, Indus Script Cipher (Delhi, Pratibha Prakashan) was released at Delhi University on Nov. 24, 2010:

# No archaeological evidence to prove western invasion in the subcontinent: Experts

Staff Reporter, The Hindu

Having set the tone for a discussion on the roots of Indian civilization, the seminar, “How deep are the roots of Indian civilization? An archaeological and historical perspective”, brought up some pertinent questions related to the subcontinent's past on Friday.

Day two of the seminar organised by Draupadi Trust in collaboration with the Ministry of Culture, the Indian Council for Cultural Relations and the Archaeological Survey of India was marked by inputs from renowned archaeologists and scholars.

In the first session, Omilos Meleton Cultural Institute (Greece) director Prof. N. Kazanas spoke about the “Collapse of the Aryan invasion theory” based on linguistic evidence in the Rigveda supporting the indigenous nature of Indian civilization and genetic evidence that there was “no influx of new genes after 10000 B. C. in India”.

Prof. Kazanas' presentation was followed by Case Western Reserve University Anthropology professor Jim G. Shaffer, who spoke about the “Harappan diaspora”, explaining how the increase in population density of Haryana and eastern Punjab and decrease in population in Cholistan in the late Harappan period suggest a “displacement from Harappan civilization towards the east”. He also said there was no archaeological evidence to prove western invasion in the subcontinent.

Vedic scholar Dr. Bhagwan Singh spoke about “Rigvedic Harappans: Their roots and legacy”, calling it “incorrect…to hold Aryan-speaking branch to be the sole author of Indus-Sarasvati civilization”. According to him, there were three major cultural strains- Aryan, Dravidian and Mandari -- that cannot be classified into any one familial scheme.

Shah Abdul Latif University (Pakistan) Vice-Chancellor Nilofar Shaikh presented recent evidence found by the excavation of Lakahn-Jo- Daro site in Pakistan. The architectural evidence at the site suggests a strong linkage to the “mature Indus” civilization, in addition to some unique features like “I- shaped bricks”.

Ms. Shaikh's presentation was followed by Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda's professor of Archaeology V.H. Sonawane's paper on “The Harappan scenario in Gujarat”; Department of Archaeology and Museums (Raipur) advisor Dr. A.K. Sharma's paper on “The Harappan Horse - A study in comparative occurrence during Harappan & post Harappan times” and ASI (Nagpur)'s Dr. Nadini Sahu's presentation on “Excavations at the Early Harappan site of Bhirrana”.

The last session included presentations by ASI secretary general K.N. Dikshit on “The decline and legacy of Harappan civilization” and ASI joint director-general Dr. B.R. Mani titled “From Janas to Janapadas”. The day concluded with BHU professor Purushottam Singh who raised some important questions at the end of his presentation on “Early archaeology in the Gangetic Plains”.

Prof. Singh pointed out that the Ganga Valley civilization had no evidence of religion except burial grounds found in some places. He also questioned the absence of a “label” like the Aryans or Harappans for the people of this civilization, who had contributed significantly to the history of the subcontinent.

**Focus on Indian civilisation**

Staff Reporter, The Hindu

NEW DELHI: Focussing on creating awareness in civil society about recent archaeological and historical researches and to promote understanding and relevance of Indian civilization in modern times, a seminar, “How deep are the roots of Indian civilization? An archaeological and historical perspective” was inaugurated by Ministry of Culture Secretary Jawahar Sircar here on Thursday. Organised by Draupadi Trust in collaboration with knowledge partners Archaeological Survey of India and Indian Archaeological Society and hosted by the Vivekananda International Foundation, the three-day-long seminar will include presentations by renowned scholars and archaeologists from India and abroad.

Mr. Sircar stressed the importance of a “serious study on the subject of antiquity of Indian civilisation” and urged scholars to base their research on rational, not emotional basis. He inaugurated an exhibition- “Draupadi: Shashakt- Rupa Rupeshwari”- depicting the life of Draupadi as a woman of substance.

Delivering the keynote address, former ASI Director-General Prof. B. B. Lal spoke about “postulates \[that\] have been distorting our vision of India's past”. Among these is the belief that the Vedas are no older than 1200 B.C. and that Vedic people were nomads. Recent excavations at sites in Rajasthan, Punjab, Haryana and Gujarat and a fresh study of Vedic texts, he said, have proved that most of these postulates are “ill- founded.”

According to Prof. Lal, these excavations proved that the Rigveda is older than 2,000 BC and people of this civilisation were not nomads. Quashing the “Aryan invasion theory” he said that the Harappan civilisation did not become extinct, and C-14 dating procedures proved that Harappan and Vedic people were indigenous, not invaders or migrants.

Thursday's session focussed on the life and practices of Harappan and Vedic civilisations with presentations on scientific findings of the drainage system in north-west India with regard to river Saraswati by Central Arid Zone Research Institute's Dr. J. R. Sharma and Indian Space Research Organisation scientist Dr. Bidyut Bhadra; the geographic identification and significance of Sapta Sindhu by California State University Professor Dr. Shiva Bajpai; Harappan town planning and water harvesting by former ASI Joint Director-General Dr. R. S. Bisht; continuum in town planning and metrology in Harappan in classical India by Coimbatore scholar Dr. Michel Danino and a comparative study of the middle Asian intercultural space and the Indus civilisation by University of Bologne (Italy) Professor Maurizio Tosi. Also present was Shah Abdul Latif University (Pakistan) Vice-Chancellor Dr. Nilofar Shaikh.

Draupadi Trust Chairperson Neera Misra spoke about the need for a “holistic approach to development” and knowledge of one's civilisation being an important part of development of a nation.
