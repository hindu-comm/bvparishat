Dear Sadhaka,  
Namasthe!  
I agree with your understanding "YOGA". in its original sense it is a  
wilful attenpt on the part of the individual to undergo transformation  
by transcending the present state of physical, mental and spiritual  
existence. if yoga is understood as a tool and an end in this sense,  
any attempt by any person, any where in the cosmos must be treated as  
Yoga Practioner. The technique might have been named as Yoga in  
India; shamanism in South Africa or with some other name elsewhere.  
Hence, the codifier of Yoga System sage Pathanjali called it as  
"Mahavrata" crossing the limits of 'jaati, desa, kaala, samaya' ,  
while dealing with 'yama', one of the components of 'ashtangayoga.'

regards,  
rajendra reddy
