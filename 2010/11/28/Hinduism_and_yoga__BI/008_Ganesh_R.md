Dear Prof. Kannan,  
I am very glad to see your insightful comment on mahaavrata, yama, vrata and other aspects of the yogashaastra. I am much enlightened by your beautiful elucidation of some of the subtle shaastric nuances involved here.  
It is very sad that people like Dr. Deepak Chopra having least understanding of Sanaatana Dharma and its wonderful classical tongue Sanskrit, blabber and create confusion in tne minds of the masses.  
I hope more from you on such things and issues.  
  
Thanking you and with regards  
  
ganesh
