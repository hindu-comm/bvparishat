Source: Aithal, P.K. 1982. "Deva-svaamin: a forgotten jurist?Æ In *Indology and Law, Studies in Honour of Professor J. Duncan M. Derrett,* pp. 106-119. (eds) Sontheimer, Günther-Dietz; Parameswara Kota Aithal. Wiesbaden: Steiner.

  

In fn 1 on p. 106, Aithal informs that a commentary on theAa;svalaayana-;srauta-suutra ascribed to D-Swas expected to be published by the Vishveshvarand Vedic Research Institute. Has it been published during the intervening 28 years? I did not find any record of it in the electronic catalogues of libraries I could consult. Perhaps a member of this list associated with the VVRI or having access to catalogues of Indian libraries can clarify what the situation is.

  

T. Aufrecht's*Catalogus Catalogorum* (p. 260) refers to "NP. VII, 6Æ as a source for the information that a commentary by D-S on the Baudhaayana-;srauta-suutra exists. "NPÆ stands for *A Catalogue of Sanskrit Manuscripts in Private Libraries of the North-Western Provinces, Allahabad: 1877-86* and "VIIÆ stands for vol 7 of the ten volumes of the catalogue. As the ms was in a private collection, as more than 115 years have past since the publication of the catalogue and as the area in which the ms was likely to be found has been subjected to political upheavals for almost a hundred years, it is unlikely that the ms will ever come to the purview of a researcher. However, sometimes miracles take place in the case of mss or previously unknown copies are discovered. Has any member of this list seen a ms of the work or a listing of such a ms? Does the *New**Catalogus Catalogorum* have any additional information?

  

Has any confusion between Deva-svaamin and Deva-traata occurred?
