"I have heard from Bannanje that the copy of manuscript of Mahaabhashya was first found in Kerala and no copy of it was found elsewhere in rest of India. ...both works were found in Kerala and now where else and that Mahaabhashyakaara Patanjali ... Bhaasa... THESE TWO EMINENT LUMINIARIES MUST HAVE BELONGED TO KERALA AND NOT TO ANY OTHER PROVINCE IN REST OF INDIA."

  

An oversimplified version of Vaakyapadiiya 2.486 (ya.h pata;njali-;si.syebhyo ...) seems to be contained in the first sentence. This verse, along with Raaja-tara:ngi.nii 1.176 (parvataad aagama.m ...), has given rise to scholarly literature for over 100 years. It should by now be clear from the points made in this literature that both the sources do not talk about a loss of the Mahaabhaa.sya text, but about a loss of the aagama of the text (knowledge of the tradition of the text -- what Pata;jali presupposed and/or how Pata;njali was understood before the time of Candraacaarya and Bhart.r-hari).

  

The details of the literature I have in mind can be gathered from Prof. George Cardona's surveys of studies done on Paa.nini's grammar:

Cardona, George. 1976. *Panini: a Survey of Research.* The Hague and Paris: Mouton. Indian reprints: 1980, 1997. Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass.

Cardona, George. 1999. *Recent Researches in Paninian Studies*. Delhi: Motilal Banarssidas.
