Bhasa’s date remains uncertain. We can place him before 400 BCE. My  
father late Prof.S.Rangachar published several of Bhasa’s dramas with  
text, detailed introduction, translation etc. by collecting all  
available information (Samskrita Sahitya Sadana, Mysore). Vaasavadatta  
story is based on the Brihatkatha. Hence this cannot be an evidence  
for claiming Bhasa should be before Patanjali. This has been pointed  
out by several already. The dream scene is the originality of Bhasa  
that is how the drama is named Svapna-vasavadatta. However, for dating  
the following information is sharper than others:

Pratijna-YaugandharayaNa Act 4 verse 2 is

नवं शरावं सलिलैः सुपूर्णम् सुसंस्कृतं दर्भ कृतोत्तरीयम् ॥  
तत्तस्य मा भून्नरकं स गच्छेद् यो भर्तृपिण्डस्य कृते न युध्येत् ॥

Kautilya’s arthashastra 10th book chapter 3 quotes this as the second  
shloka below, in praise of loyal soldiers.

KAZ10.3.29/ api^iha zlokau bhavataH //  
KAZ10.3.30ab/ "yaan yajJa.saMghais tapasaa ca vipraaH svarga.eSiNaH  
paatra.cayaiz ca yaanti /  
KAZ10.3.30cd/ kSaNena taan apy atiyaanti zuuraaH praaNaan suyuddheSu  
parityajantaH //  
KAZ10.3.31ab/ "navaM zaraavaM salilasya puurNaM susaMskRtaM  
darbha.kRta.uttariiyam /  
KAZ10.3.31cd/ tat tasya maa bhuun narakaM ca gacched yo  
bhartR.piNDasya kRte na yudhyet - iti //

Hence there is a strong case to claim Kautilya quoted the verse from  
Pr.Yau. Incidentally Pr.Yau makes one remember the famous vows  
(Pratijna) of ChaaNakya usually equated with Kautilya. This similarity  
can not be easily missed. If we place Kautilaya around 400 BCE Bhasa  
would be at least a contemporary of Kautilya if not his senior.
