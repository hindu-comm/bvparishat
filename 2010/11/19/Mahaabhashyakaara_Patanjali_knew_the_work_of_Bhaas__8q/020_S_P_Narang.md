From the evidence of Kalidasa ( Megha0), it appears that Vasavadatta was a theme of the romantic story and that a number of scholars wrote on it including Bhasa, Subandhu and that referred to by Patanjali. To mix up all of them will be injustice to the authors of Vasavadatta. They belong to different times and places. Regards, spnarang
