Respected scholars,  
References of books certainly show the posteriority of the referring authors. But at the same time it may not be right to imagine that referring authors and the referred authors were belonged to some particular region of the subcontinent.The statement: "the copy of manuscript of Mahaabhashya was first found in Kerala and no copy of it was found elsewhere in rest of India." only shows that there had a tradition of Kerala in preserving manuscripts in whichever scripts of the contemporary practice. It is not clear that when the copy of manuscript of Mahaabhashya was first found in Kerala. During the 11th Century A. D. Kerala had a rich tradition of learning Sanskrit Grammar at four locations called: Kumpala, Chovvannoor, Etakkalattoor and Uppala. Bhasa's works were also preserved by the Travancore Royal Family, where Raja Ravi Varma and Svaati Tirunaal etc. were born and flourished, may simply be due to their excessive intimacy towards arts and dramaturgy. Telugu, Grantha and Malayalam scripts were popular in Kerala while manuscripting contents on the palm leaves with the iron sticks.  
  
But locating manuscripts is a different issue. Gangesopadhyaya of Mithila may not be a Keralite whereas his Nyaya works were popular throughout the belt of southern peninsula in Telugu script; but located at far south of Kerala. What does it mean? It shows the unity of Indian Shastra Tradition, and that unity is beyond boundaries.  
  
Bhashyakaara can refer from Bhasa's work on two aspects:  
  
1. He might have watched and listened to the drama, or  
2. He might have had a manuscript in a popular or some regional script. ( I don't have much of an idea about the status of scripts during or beyond the 2nd Century B. C.)  
  
I would like to know that who is the author of Sumanottaraa?  
  
These are my humble thoughts and assumptions. I am sorry if I went wrong.
