अभिवाद्य,

  
  
\>he violates Paninian rules (of Patanjali).  

In the above context (violation of rules)  
I would like to draw the attention of the scholars to an  
important work of Sri Melpattur Bhatta Shreepada(Bhattatiripad)  
of Kerala titled "अपाणिनीयप्रद्योत:" (or is it प्रक्रियासर्वस्वं ?, kindly correct me.)  
Either of these texts(or both?) provides authentic usages which are  
non-Panini. In other words, there seems to be no such error of violating  
Paninian rules.  
In the works of Sri Madhvacharya there are many usages which appear to be  
"aPanini".(especially in Mahabharatatatparyanirnayam.Refer to Sri Bannanje's notes.)  
Besides, there are "Chaandasa" usages which are Veda-specific.  
  
धन्योस्मि।
