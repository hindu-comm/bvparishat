namo vidvadbhyah

Let there not be any confusion - VAsasvadattA of Subandhu and  
SvapnavAsavadattam of BhAsa .

I do not know as to how one can make 'pUrvapadalopa' (satyA / bhAmA ) etc.

Under ' adhikrtya krte granthe' (PAn 4-3-87) Patanjali quotes one  
VArtikam , i.e. lubAkhyAyikabhyo bahulam , and comments - adhikrtya  
krte granthe ityatra AkhyAyikAbhyo bahulam kubvaktavyah - vAsavadattA  
, sumanoharA .

Kaiyata says - tAdarthye caturthy , AkhyAyikAbhidhAnAya yah pratyayah  
tasya bahulam lub bhavatItyarthah .

There is no 'vrddhAcchah' etc by Kaiyata .

Even SankarAcArya in second AdhyAya of SArIrakabhAsyam discusses the aspect of  
names and history . It is difficult to decide the date with the data available .

In VAsavadatta , Subandhu refers to UdyotakAra who belonged to 600-700 AD .

Take some internal evidence --

1\. gonardIyastvAha - is a usage wherein Patanjali offeres a synonym  
unto himself - gAvah  
nardanti atreti gonardah - a place in KAsmIr .

In Kerala there has been a severe problem of livestock and hence a  
person from that  
land only invented ' AmUl '(= non-breast milk) . So it cannot be Gonarda .

2\. Patanjali belongs to AryAvarta -- prsodarAdIni yathopadistam (PAn 6-3-109) .  
Migration of Aryas had been there and even today we address father by  
the term 'Arya'.  
Rather by all evidence Patanjali does not belong to Kerala .

3\. If names of books mentioned have to be taken as authority to decide  
the domicile of a person then what about other works mentioned by  
Patanjali . Does this apply to PAnini etc also ?

4\. VisrAmah is 'apAninIya' and CAndravyAkaranasAdhya . It is used  
by BhavabhUti  
(UttararAmacaritam) and KAlidAsa (SAkuntalam - 7) . There are other  
usages also .

A PrAkrtasabda , i.e. IngAlam (angArah) - is used by SrIharsa  
(Naisadham - 1 ) - vitenuringAlamivAyasah pare . The same is used by  
AppayyadIksita in SiddhAntalesasamgraha .

5\. With the same name there can be many books - Vivaranam in AdvaitavedAnta and  
PUrvamImAmsA (BhAsyavivaranam ) . So which VAsavadattA ?

Such a discussion may not be very useful in any way .
