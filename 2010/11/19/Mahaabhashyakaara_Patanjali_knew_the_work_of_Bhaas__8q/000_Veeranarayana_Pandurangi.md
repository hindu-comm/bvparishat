To all,

It is of some great historical value that I find Mahaabhashyakaara Patanjali quoting the work of Bhaasa Mahakavi “Vasavadatta” in his commentary – The Mahabhasya. The reference to this great work of Bhaasa, who was anterior to Kalidasa, is found under the comment by Patanjali on Paniniya sootra “adhikrutya krute granthe” \[4/3/87\]. While throwing light on the Katyayana Vararuchi’s vartika on the this sootra, Patanjali says that the word used in the sootra “Granthe” refers to book if it is an aakhyaayika meaning story of a person and the affix is elided and gives two examples - 1. Vasavadattaa and 2. Sumanottaraa.

My interest in this finding of Mahaabhashya with particular reference to the work of Bhaasa viz.,Vasavadattaa that is quoted by name is of high historical value. Two points to ponder here:-

A\] Mahaabhashyakaara Patanjali is posterior to Bhaasa as it is clear from the reference he makes to latter’s work.

B\] Bhaasa Mahakavi and Mahaabhashyakaara Patanjali must have belonged to the same region. This is purely my conjecture as works of both these luminaries in their own respective filed of “Dramatturgy” and “Grammar” were found in the state of Kerala. I have heard from Bannanje that the copy of manuscript of Mahaabhashya was first found in Kerala and no copy of it was found elsewhere in rest of India.

Secondly, as student of Sanskrit I was told by my college lecturer many years ago that Bhaasa’s 13 plays were found lying in the one of the palaces in Kerala intact and it was discovered by the great scholar Shriyut T Ganapathi Shastri of Kerala state in the year 1913. As many of you may know that till these 13 plays of Bhaasa were discovered, he was known to the scholarly world through scanty references by other doctors of Sanskrit poetics here and there. Bhaasa was almost forgotten and he would have been permanently removed from the literary firmament had it not been for the labours of the scholar of the repute of Shriyut T Ganapathi Shastri.

I tend to draw a conjecture from this narrative that both works were found in Kerala and now where else and that Mahaabhashyakaara Patanjali makes a reference to Bhaasa’s work by name – the one which is world famous among Sanskrit plays, THE VASAVADATTA – THAT THESE TWO EMINENT LUMINIARIES MUST HAVE BELONGED TO KERALA AND NOT TO ANY OTHER PROVINCE IN REST OF INDIA. 

This is a food for thought for Sanskrit historians. While reading an English book on Paninian work I came across this finding which is of high historical value. I welcome if you anyone of can throw further light on this.

Thanks and regards / B Raghavendra
