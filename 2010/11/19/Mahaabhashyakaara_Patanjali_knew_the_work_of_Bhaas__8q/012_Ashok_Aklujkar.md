I do not know if the original post on this matter expresses the hypothesis of Dr.Veeranarayana Pandurangi orB Raghavendra, whose name appears at the end.

  

Objective and internal as well as external (and therefore, strong) evidence exists to think of Pata;njali, the Mahaabhaa.sya author, as a native of Kashmir. Please see my three articles in \_Linguistic Traditions of Kashmir\_, published by D.K. Printworld, New Delhi.

  

It has already been made clear by more than one correspondent on the issue that Pata;njali's example Vaasava-dattaa does not refer to any particular written composition, certainly not to Bhaasa's Svapna-vaasava-dattam or Subandhu's Vaasava-dattaa.

  

To ascribe the Trivandrum plays to Bhaasa has become a tradition in modern scholarship. Yet it should be borne in mind that the internal evidence to ascribe the plays to Bhaasa exists only in the case of the Svapna-vaasava-dattam and Pratij;naa-yaugandharaaya.nam. Even in the case of these two plays, the evidence does not match exactly with what we find in the texts preserved in the mss. The texts in the mss could bera:ngaav..rttis (stage versions), not the original scripts. Bhaasa entirely in his own words has probably not come down to us beyond the few verses that are quoted in some older anthologies.

  

Just because the other eleven plays were found in one bundle (this information, too, needs to be checked for its accuracy and completeness; see below), along withthe Svapna-vaasava-dattam and Pratij;naa-yaugandharaaya.nam,does not make them plays of the same person as the author ofthe Svapna-vaasava-dattam and Pratij;naa-yaugandharaaya.nam (who, as I indicate above, may remotely be Bhaasa). It is common to find works of several authors in one reasonably large manuscript. Also, several of those eleven plays have been found separately. (Prof. N.P. Unni's book gives the details).

  

One manuscript of Pratimaa, if I recall correctly, even has a colophon that can possibly be taken as referring to the authorship of one Kaatyaayana (which we should not view as Bhaasa's gotra unless we come across another ancient source saying that Bhaasa's gotra indeed was Kaatyaayana). 

  

Most of the similarities seen in the thirteen plays can possibly be more straightforwardly (and hence more satisfactorily) explained as arising out of the fact that Kerala actors (particularly the Caakyaars) were using them as scripts for their performances. In fact, some Kerala scholars (Pisharoty?) took this position in T. Ganapati Sastri's own time.

  

This is not to say that the texts could not be (reasonably) old or contain the essences of old plays.

  

My main point is that we should not jump to conclusions without recognizing the uncertainties and complexities of evidence, without taking the evidence into account cumulatively, without maintaining a critical attitude toward the work of earlier scholars (however great and deserving of our gratitude they may be) and without reviewing at least some of the published scholarship.

  

Has anyone on the list actually seen the manuscript bundle which T. Ganapati Sastri used? Have the manuscripts utilized by him for his editions of the individual Trivandrum plays been specifically identified?

  

While Bhaasa continues to be studied and taught in India through secondary literature, it is a group in Germany that is trying to go back to the very foundation of that secondary literature. (No, they have not started this only because they got the money to do this sort of research. Money for humanities research is relatively scarce in the West, too. The more important and potentially helpful question is why someone in India did not think of the project after the work of Prof. Unni, if not after the work of Ganapati Sastri and C.R. Deodhar/Devadhar.). To get an idea of what the German project has achieved, please see (although not all sub-links seem to work at present):
