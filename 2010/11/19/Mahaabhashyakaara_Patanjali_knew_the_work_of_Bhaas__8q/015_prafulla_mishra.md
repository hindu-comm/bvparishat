Since you quote from MB, it appears the akhyayika may be a floatinf akhyayika and not of Subandhus'

Secondly Kalidasa refers to Udayankatha kovidaq gramavrddhan may be adopted by Gunadhya and subsequently the character might be a symbol of a hero for which Bhasa, Subandhu and all others have adopted this character.
