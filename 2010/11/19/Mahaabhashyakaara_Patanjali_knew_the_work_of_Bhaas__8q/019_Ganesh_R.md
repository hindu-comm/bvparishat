Dear Dr. Ashok Aklujkar,  
  
I am very happy with your observations and me too agree with your understanding. The Trivendram plays - except Svapna and to a very little extant Prtijnaa Naatika - are not penned by Bhasa, the great poet eulogized by Kalidasa. Even patanjali is not from Kerala. Your points are very well supported by relevant proofs. During my study on Bhasa from various angles including those of language, prosody, figures of speech, cultural studies and comparative analysis I have come to agree with most of the facts that Prof. N.P.Unni has revealed.  
  
Thank you and with regards  
  
ganesh  
  
(Sataavadhaani Dr. R. Ganesh)
