Dear Prof. Bhattacharya,

  

Your response made me look at my wording again, and I discovered an oversight on my part. "Raaja-tara:ngi.nii 1.176 (parvataad aagama.m ...)" should read "Raaja-tara:ngi.nii 1.176 (candraacaaryaadibhir labdhvaa ...), Sorry for this.

  

The texts of the crucial verses are:

Vaakyapadiiya 2.485-486: ya.h pata;njali-;si.syebhyo [bhra.s.to](http://bhra.s.to) vyaakara.naagama.h / kaale sa [daak.si.naatye.su](http://daak.si.naatye.su) grantha-maatre vyavasthita.h // parvataad aagama.m labdhvaa bhaa.sya-biijaanusaribhi.h sa niito bahu-;saakhatva.m candraacaaryaadibhi.h puna.h //

  

(If the detail brahma-rak.sasaaniiya in Pu.nya-raaja's commentary (really an abbreviated text of Helaa-raaja's so far undiscovered commentary on the second kaa.n.da) is to be accommodated by ignoring the superstitious element in it, parvataad can be understood as a corruption of paarvataad.)

  

Raaja-tara:ngi.nii 1.176: candraacaaryaadibhir labdhvaade;sa.m tasmaat tadaagamam (--> sahaagamam) / pravartita.m mahaabhaa.sya.m. sva.m ca vyaakara.na.m k.rtam //

  

(Whytadaagamam must be a corruption ofsahaagamam is pointed out in my article in the Radha Govind Basak commemoration volume. If this or any other article -- all listed in Cardona's two bibliographic surveys mentioned in my last post -- are inaccessible to you and you wish to read them, I will happily send their pdfs to you. Please let me know what the limit of your INBOX is.)

  

I have published four articles on the above-mentioned two texts (three on the VP text and one on the RT text -- the one specified just now). By including a fifth article that I have presented as a lecture, I intend to publish, one day, a book on "The Concluding Verses of Bhart.r-hari's Vaakya-kaa.nd.a."

  

Although a few details of my views have changed over the years as my acquaintance with theVaakyapadiiya and theRaaja-tara:ngi.nii grew, their basic historical understanding has not changed. The very fact that two independent works, theVP and theRT, speak of a recoveryonlyof the aagama, as distinct from a recovery of a muula text or manuscript, should settle the issue, regardless of whether one agrees with this or that emendation.

  

The Mahaabhaa.sya is primarily a commentary on the Vaarttikas and secondarily on the suutras of Paa.nini. So, it does not seem problematic to me that it does not comment on all the suutras. Again, the very fact that the MB text refers to or presupposes several of the suutras on which it does not comment should establish that the author's intention was not to comment on all the suutras.

  

Like all ancient works, the text of the MB has suffered in transmission, but not to the extent of justifying "the original has been irretrievably lost" as the conclusion. As I have suggested elsewhere, a MB edn based on South Indian and Kashmiri mss is badly needed. Kielhorn's work, done with the help of ;saastrins in Pune, admirable in its own time, is not sufficient for the current needs of research. It is almost entirely based on Devanagari mss, which, generally tend to be inferior to mss in South Indian scripts.
