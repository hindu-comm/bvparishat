!. why should Kha.n.ddeva go for Harismara.nam while discussing
Jaimini etc ?  
  
2. there will be svagranthavirodha leading to Veda - aprAmA.nya  
  
The general belief of most of the scholars is that - **nowhere did Jaimini refute 's'arIra to Devatas**' .  
  
MImAmsakas argue that there is no need of DevatAprasAda (see VigrahAdi) , rather **'Karma' itself can render the  
'Phala' .**  
On the other hand S'abarasvAmy in his BhA.syam in DevatAdhikara.nam said - there is no S'arIra to Devatas and  
S'AbdasvarUpa only is DevatA . He did so in order to achieve PrAdhAnyam and integrity to Karma .  
Following this there has been a lot of reaction .  
  
The author of S'AstradIpikA , S'AlikanAthamis'ra (1100AD) , a
follower of KumArila , had said this -  
  
**in case we accept VigrahAdi to Devatas then we also have to accept - their arrival on KarmabhUmi , consumption of Havis etc, , having T.rpti , anugraha , granting the Phala etc . Then DevatA will become important vis-a-vis Karmaphala .  
The result will be that human beinings will become less and less interested in Karmas . Therefore , VigrahAdi to Devatas is acceptable but PhaladAt.rtvam and PrAdhanyam are not acceptable .  
**  
**By and large it seems that the purport of SUtrakartA and otheer Nibandhakartas is that somehow or other a lot of S'raddhA in Karma has to be generated to people and nothing else .  
  
It is just like -- vi.sam bhu'nk.sva , mA cAsya g.rhe bhu'nkthA.h -- consume poison , never dine in this person's house- it is TAtparyav.rtti to be taken , not AbhidhA . One need not consume poison .  
**  
**Kha.n.dadeva also a follower of KumArila and S'AlikanAtha . Therefore , in order to show that the non-acceptance of VigrahAdi is not the SiddhAnta he went for ' Harismara.nam' .**  
  
**It also amounts to refuting Mantras such as - namassomAya ca rudrAya ca .... namas's'ivAya ca s'ivatarAya ca . And obiviously** **it leads to Veda - aprAmA.nyam**  
  
KumArila's PrArthanA at the outset of **S'lokavArtikam** runs like this -  
  
**vis'uddhajnAnadehAya [trivedIdivyacak.su.se](http://trivedIdivyacak.su.se) I  
s'reya.hprAptinimittAya namassomArdhadhAri.ne II  
  
  
Kha.n.dadeva in BhA.t.tadIpikA --  
  
vis'ves'varam namask.rtya kha.n.dadevasatAm mude I  
tanute tatprasAdena samksiptam bhA.t.tadIpikAm II  
  
VaiyAkara.nas** do not accept Var.nas but assign meaning to the same . **MImAmsakas** acept Var.nas but dicuss the meaning of Pada and Vakya only .  
  
**S'ankarAcArya** ( **in line with PUrvamImAmsa** ) refutes Spho.ta (DevatAdhikara.nam) but the same is there in **BhAgavata,  
BhArata etc .**  
  
  
**BAdarAya.na** refutes Yoga (**etena yogah pratyukt.h - BrahmasUtram - 2-1-3**) but he did not mean to refute the **Upani.sad** --  
  
**s'rotavyo mantavyo nididhAsitavya.h etc. . this is clear in S'ArIrakabhA.syam .**  
  
The **Pancakos'Adhikara.nam in BrahmAnandavallI and Bh.rguvallI (TaittirIyopani.sad)** is just an upAya and it ends up  
in the **siddhAnta** -- **brahma puccham prati.s.thA** . So all five , viz **Anna-prA.na-mano-vijnAna-Ananda , are not real .  
**  
Hari in **VAkyapadIya** (1-74 , 2-238) says --  
  
**bhinnam dars'namAs'ritya vyavahAro'nugamyate I  
tatra yanmukhyameke.sAm tatrAnye.sAm viparyaya.h II (viparyaya.h = opposite)  
  
upAyA.h sik.sama.nAnAm bAlAnAm apalAlanA.h I  
asatye vartmani sthitvA tatassatyam samIhate II**  
  
One should try to understand the SiddhAnta in the terse Texts of Indian Philosophy .  
**  
Finally one should perform Karmas to attain MAnasikas'uddhi leading to Mok.sa .
