Dear Prof. Korada,

Although my post appears at the end of your post, yours is not a reaction to my post, I suppose.

I enjoy your posts. At places, however, I prefer to maintain the historical differences of schools (without thinking of them as totally settled or sealed) and not to synthesize their differences, using the umbrella of Vedanta. What is logically possible (the application of Gau.da-paada's 'tair aya.m na virudhyate' approach) is not always chronologically defensible.
