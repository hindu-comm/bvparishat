I agree with roughly the first part of the English sentence: "Khandadeva faithfully paraphareses the thought of mimamsakas and in the end he is taking shelter under Lord Hari for having talked about \[it =he thought of mimamsakas\] in his work ..." But I do not know how the part "what is contrary to the heart of the vedas" can be read in Kha.n.da-deva's statement. Probably this part is expressive of Mr. Raghavendra's own view.

  

The conclusion arrived at by Kevalaananda Sarasvatii, compiler of the [Miimaa.msaa-ko.sa](http://Miimaa.msaa-ko.sa), is noteworthy: na jaimininaa devataanaa.m niraasa.h k.rta.h (Vol. I, Prastaava, pp. 25-26).

  

The following article may be useful:

Clooney, Francis X. 1988: "Devataadhikara.na: the theological reconstruction of the gods inMiimaa.msaaand Vedaanta." Journal of Indian Philosophy 16:277-298.

  

Recently I have written the following articles bearing on the early history of theMiimaa.msaa. They do not discuss the devataa debate itself but indirectly suggest how the debate should be studied.

**1**. 2009. "V.rtti and V.rttikaara in Raamaanuja's ;Srii-bhaa.sya." In Anantam Saastram, Indological and Linguistic Studies in Honour of Bertil Tikkanen, Studia Orientalia 108: 3-20. (ed) Karttunen, Klaus. Helsinki. A corrective to fn 4 and section 1.3 para 2 of this article is provided in article 3 below.

**2**. 2010? "Unity of theMiimaa.msaas: how historiography hides history."

**3**. 2011? "Authorship of the Sa.mkar.sa-kaa.n.da."

**4**. 2011? "Sa.mkar.sa-kaa.n.da: a Victim inMiimaa.msaaMadhyama-vyaayoga."

  

Except for the first, the articles are in the press for different felicitation volumes. Hence I can give the publication particulars only after the volumes are published.

  

The points I have made in the preceding articles which are closer to Mr. B. Raghavendra's query are the following:

\(a\) Jaimini and Baadaraaya.na may not be voicing their personal views of devataa but the views which their hermeneutics require in order to be sound schemes or theories. To expand: If the Miimaa.msaa accepted ii;svara, he must be omniscient and the Veda must be his statements; otherwise there will not be much gain in making a place for him. Therefore, if the Ii;svara option is followed,Miimaa.msaa will be essentially making a claim of the sort the prophetic traditions (Buddhists, Jains etc in ancient Indian context.) make: "The prophet P-1's statements are valid and offer infallible guidance, because he/she is omniscient.' TheMiimaa.msaa philosophy will become a philosophy of faith in a particular person. It is no wonder that the laterMiimaa.msakas attack sarvaj;natva and defend the practice of (methodically and consistently) deriving the right message from an unchangeable text beyond human history, namely the Veda.

  

It is fallaciously and simplistically said or assumed that every ancient Indian philosopher expresses his personal faith or creed in his writings. This is a part of the other canard that India has no pure philosophy, only philosophy mixed with religion and that the Indian philosophers do not pursue knowledge for the sake of knowledge. From my own experience and after noticing cases like that of Vacaspati-mi;sra, I can easily accept what Prof. D. Bhattacharya has written, namely that when Pattabhirama Shastri taughtMiimaa.msaa he did not teach it as a Hindu devoted to particular theism or to theism in general. As I recall, P.T. Raju has also said the same thing in one of his books about his pa.n.dita teachers.

  

\(b\) The Sa.mkar.sa-kaa.n.da is authored by Kaa;sak.rtsna. It fits between the(Puurva)Miimaa.msaa-suutra and the Brahma-suutra, but does not have so much concern with the devataas as to become a Devataa-kaa.n.da.

  

In view of my article 2, Professor Clooney (Harvard University) could have changed some of his earlier views on theMiimaa.msaa and the place of devataas in it. I have not been in touch with him recently. He read a pre-publication draft of article 2 and accepted its conclusion. Unlike some other scholars, he does not mind saying that he has changed his view after reading new evidence or a new argument. Yet his old article mentioned above will be useful as an example of methodologically sophisticated thinking and precisely given bibliography.
