This view of the Mimaskas is also stated as puurvapaksha in the very first  
chapter of the Mrigendraagama, one of the important Agama-s of the  
Saivasiddhanta tradition. The commentator Narayanakantha who lived in Kashmir  
(circa 9th century) and the sub-commentary on this composed by Aghorasivacharya  
who lived in the 12th century in the Chola country develop this view and refute  
it.
