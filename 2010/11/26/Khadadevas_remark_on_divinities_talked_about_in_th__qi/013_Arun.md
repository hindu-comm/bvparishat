I had made the same remarks in my commentary on Sankhya  
siddhanta-'ईश्वरस्य प्रयोजनं नास्ति'. There is unnecessary division of  
Seshvara and Nirishvara sankhya. I had a long discussion with pandit  
Dwarakanatha Shastri-greatest translator of Baudha texts. He was very  
firm that Buddha (Siddhartha) was atheist. My interpretation was that  
he was following verbal logic of Gautama, so he was called Gautama  
Buddha. In that logic, discussion of God or Brahma is not needed, so  
he did not say anything on that. But if Bauddha philosophy does not  
believe in Atma, then what was taking birth in 100 lives of Buddha as  
described in Jataka tells?-Arun
