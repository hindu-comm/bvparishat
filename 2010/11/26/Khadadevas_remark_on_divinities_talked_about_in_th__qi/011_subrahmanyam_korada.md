Dear Prof Aklujkar  
  
Yes , that's right . My posting , as is evident from the questions I noted at the top, was an answer  
to Dr Raghavendra's two questions and there no room for any doubt .  
  
In my first posting I quoted VedAnta and had shown how the theory of VigrahAdi was  
refuted across the Dars'anas , if taken historically .This is not to be taken as synthesizing  
differences . There is nothing wrong in taking up what is said by other schools .  
  
It should not be construed as setled or sealed as it goes against the tenets of Indian Philosophy --  
'abhiyuktatarai.h anyai.h anyathaivopapadyate' (VAkyapadIyam) . This is historically proved .  
  
But today we do not have a KumAdrila or a S'Ankara .  
  
The History, for most part , is not perfect and it is subject to revision . One would say with available contents  
and there is no othergo .  
  
There are two ways --  
1. take the school , that is being discussed ,only and explain the details .  
2. give an overall picture , mostly the final one , taking the total picture of Indian Philosophy in a chronological order . .  
  
Dr Raghavendra asked - 'to throw light on this' . So I did . It was in his latter post that he precisely put the two questions  
If a question is asked , unless it is put secifically , it depends upon the perspective of the respondent to offer an answer .  
When Dr Raghavendra quoted from BhA.t.tadIpika what does it mean ? He was well aware of the earlier texts and  
wants further discussion , unless he makes it clear as to where the respondent should start . Generally speaking ,  
in such postings it is difficult to estimate the questioner's level and most of the scholars do not go beyond the  
School / System .  
Rather I strongly feel that this Forum should offer more than what is avilable in the texts , i.e.  
a comparitive and comprehensive (as far as possible) picture of things .  
  
prajnA vivekam labhate bhinnairAgamadars'anai.hI  
kiyadvA s'akyamunnetum svatarkamanudhAvatA ? (VAkyapadIyam - VAkyakA.n.da.h)  
  
I am vindicated in my second posting as I stuck to the questions raised .  
  
The picture in this regard is this - Jaimini did not say ' no vigrahAdi' .  
  
It was stated and elaborated by S'AbarasvAmy in his BhA.syam in DevatAdhikara.nam .  
  
The latter commentators explained the position but did not agree with S'abarasvAmy .  
  
There are many instances where Upavar.sav.rtti / S'AbarabhA.syam was
refuted by KumArila etc.  
  
Also , we have to take KumArila's As'valAyanag.rhyaparis'is.tam etc. into consideration .  
  
Also , without prejudice to any person (according to Adiparva of MahAbhAtata this is not wrong) one who regularly practises the Karmas ordained by Veda , i.e SvAdhyAya , SandhyAvandanam , PancamahAyajnas etc. can be an authority as both theory and practice , which reached him thru avichinnaparamparA are there .  
  
Some teachers did not clearly give the position but simply said - no vigrahAdi according to MeemAmsakas , which is not the fact . It would have been better if they quoted S'AstradIpikA and BhA.t.tadIp9ikA etc. , who openly said  
to the contrary .  
  
A section of scholars kept on arguing that this is not the view of all MeemAmsakas - for example in Andhra  
this has been there and I have printed evidence to this .  
  
When we take the overall picture we may say . most of the scholars do not agree .  
  
dhanyo'smi
