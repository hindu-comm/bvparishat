Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



Is the work , "Shabda shakti prakashikaa" of Jagadeesha available on internet? Any website on it? If not has anybody written on it, its content and value of this work? Who is the publisher of the book?

I will appreciate if any scholar discusses its importance here on this list. Thanks. N.R.Joshi
