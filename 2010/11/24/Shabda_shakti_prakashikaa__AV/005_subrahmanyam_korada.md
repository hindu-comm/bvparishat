Namo vidvadbhyah

SabdasaktiprakAs’ikA , with two commentaries, KrsnakAntI and PrabodhinI was published by Chowkhamba, Varanasi , in 1973 .

JagadIsa , who is an outstanding scholar in NyAya , VyAkarana (PANini, KAtantra and BHAguri) , MImAmsA etc. refutes KumArila , PrabhAkara , CintAmani , Bhartrhari , Dandin , Amarasimha etc. One should read the book .  

In certain instances , it seems that it is difficult to support his views –

1.**SArthakasabde vAkyanirUpanam** –

… **vAkyam laksayati –**

mithssAkAnksassabdasya vyUho vAkyam caturvidham I

suptinantacayo naivam ativyAptyAdidosatah II

- The first leg of the verse is a **‘laksanam’** and the second leg , which quotes ‘Amarasimha’ is related to **‘laksyam’** .

‘**Suptinantacayo vakyam kriyA vA kArakAnvitA’** – is the text of Amarasimha - there are three kinds of Vakyas **– sup + sup = rAmah gatavAn , sup + tin = rAmah gacchati , tin + tin = pacati bhavati ; if it is a ‘kriyA’ (vA = cet ) then it should have anvaya with a
‘kAraka’**.

The above Kosa offers **‘laksyam’** rather than ‘laksanam’ (**laksanam is said by Jaimini – arthaikatvAt ekam vAkyam …) .**

**There is svagranthavirodha also** . This is not proper and in the following Vrtti , whatever is said by JagadIsa is untenable .

Natually he later refutes **KAtyAyana – astirbhavantIparah aprayujyamAno’pyasti (PAN – Anabhihite).**

2.**SArthakasabde NAmanirUpanam**

**.. ata eva nApadam prayunjIteti v.rddhAh (Patanjali) , padam vibhaktyantam , pItapatarUpamityAdAvapi nAvAntaravAkyArthabodhako mahAvAkyArthabodhah** – this statement leads to chaos – what is **AvAntaravAkyam** and what is **MahAvAkyam** ?

3\. **Taddhitaprakara.nam –**

**samkhyA.sa.dbhadrapUrvAyA .dura.n mAtuh striyAm ca n’Ip –** is the sUtra quoted (BhAguri) by JagadIs’a for – dvaimAturah , .sA.nmAturah
etc. - here why ‘.sa.t’ when ‘samkhyA’ covers it ?

**PAninisUtram for the same is – mAturutsamkhyAsambhadrapUrvAyAh (Pan 4-1-115) .**
