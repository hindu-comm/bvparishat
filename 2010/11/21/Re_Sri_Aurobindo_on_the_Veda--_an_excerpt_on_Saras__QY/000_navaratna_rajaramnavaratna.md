 Sri Aurobindo's *Secret of the Veda* must be read by all serious Hindus.

**SRI AUROBINDO**  
  
Many of the lines, many whole hymns even of the *Veda* bear on their face a mystic meaning; they are evidently an occult form of speech, have an inner meaning. When the seer speaks of Agni as “the luminous guardian of the truth shining out in his own home”, or of Mitra and Varuna or other gods as “in touch with the truth and making the truth grow” or as “born in the truth”, these are words of a mystic poet, who is thinking of that inner truth behind things of which the early sages were the seekers.  
  
He is not thinking of the nature-power presiding over the outer element of fire or of the fire of the ceremonial sacrifice. Or he speaks of Saraswati as one who impels the words of truth and awakens to right thinkings or as one opulent with the thought: Saraswati awakens to consciousness or makes us conscious of the “Great Ocean and illumines all our thoughts”. It is surely not the River Goddess whom he is thus hymning but the power, the river if you will, of inspiration, the word of the truth, bringing its light into our thoughts, building up in us that truth, an inner knowledge.  
  
Gods constantly stand out in their psychological functions; the sacrifice is the outer symbol of an inner work, an inner interchange between the gods and men — man giving what he has, the gods giving in return the horses of power, the herds of light, the heroes of strength to be his retinue, winning for him victory in his battle with the hosts of darkness, Vritras, Dasyus, Panis.  
  
When the *rishi* says, “Let us become conscious whether by the war-horse or by the word of a strength beyond men”, his words have either a mystic significance or they have no coherent meaning at all. In Vedas, there are many mystic verses and whole hymns which, however mystic, tear the veil off the outer sacrificial images covering the real sense of the *Veda*. “Thought,” says the *rishi*, “has nourished for us human things in the immortals, in the great heavens; it is the milch-cow which milks of itself the wealth of many forms” — the many kinds of wealth, cows, horses and the rest for which the sacrificer prays; evidently, this is no material wealth, it is something which thought, the thought embodied in the *mantra*, can give and it is the result of the same thought that nourishes our human things in the immortals, in the great heavens.  
  
A process of divinisation, and of a bringing down of great and luminous riches, treasures won from the gods by the inner work of sacrifice, is hinted at in terms necessarily covert but still for one who knows how to read these secret words, *ninya vacamsi*, sufficiently expressive, *kavaye nivacana*. Again, night and dawn are like “joyful weaving women weaving the weft of our perfected works into the form of a sacrifice”. Again, words with a mystic form and meaning, but there could hardly be a more positive statement of the psychological character of the sacrifice, the real meaning of the cow, of the riches sought for, the plenitudes of the great treasure.
