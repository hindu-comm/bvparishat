Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



I read all postings related to Patanjali, Mahabhashya and VAsavadattA. When it comes to the ancient India, there are multiple contradicting arguments, contradicting chronology and then suddenly everything starts hanging in the sky including Indra, VaruNa, NAsatya, Vedas. Indian astrologers and astronomers are so smart, when asked question about ancient history of India, they may start from millions of years of SatyaYuga. No hope there either. Modernized Indian writers exposed to the western sciences may talk about Gondavana, roaming dinosaurs in the ancient India, meteorite strikes, rising Himalayas. Orthodox writers may talk about flood of Manu and his fish in connection with the ancient history of India.



Mahabharata has interpolations. One does not know what is added when,
by whom, and why? So I decided to find theevidence of Mahabharata outside of the subcontinentof Mahabharata. I found that evidence. Now could you deny that main parties in the epic war were concentrated on the border between the two ancient lands of modern Pakistan and Afghanistan--Sindhu, Sauveera, Shibi, Gaandhaara, Kuru, Kamboja, Vaahlika, Shaka, Shaakala, Tushaara. Ladies kingdom, Mongols, HUNa. Not only that , the connection goes all the way towards the north pole. I am waiting to see if anybody writes about Mongolian connection of Mahabharat.



About Sanskrit-Somebody writes Vedas has seven layers of meanings. One has no hope in understanding anything in one life time. Somebody writes that Sanskrit is perfect language and it is Deva bhasshaa. But nobody knows who were Devas? Some say there were here on the earth. Some say they are in sky in their abodes. If in sky no research further. Somebody says Sanskrit came from PraNava-Om. No research further. Indo-European scholars promote the theory that Sanskrit and many other languages came from Proto-Indo-European. Asko Paropola gives talk in Tamilnadu and discusses etymology of "RAsabha" and "Gardabha" .



No wonder people would like to listen to holy Babas instead of inviting scholars to give a talk. People say that neither we understand scholars nor we understand holy Babas. But with Babas we may accrue some PuNya.



So I went in different direction-



I collected evidence of Mahabharata from outside of Indian subcontinent. It was done to find out the ancient places intimately connected with life of Krishna-Pindaaraka Teertha where Saamba received the curse of Musala-mother of Iron. This is very difficult history-Did Krishnas people go outside of the subcontinent? If Arjun can go on Digvijaya, why not Vrishnis, Yaddavas, Maadhavas, and their other clans?

With N. R. Joshi not only Mahabharat history make sense, but even the world history starts making sense with reference to Mahabharat.



Now about Sanskrit again- With my phonemic symbolism based on acoustic properties of articulated sounds, listeners see some connection between sound and sense of Sanskrit words.They start enjoying beauty of Sanskrit words- Saushabdyam ! I do not touchgrammar. Scholars do not agree on grammatical forms and there is evidence that grammatical forms have changed from Vedic to Classical Sanskrit.Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
