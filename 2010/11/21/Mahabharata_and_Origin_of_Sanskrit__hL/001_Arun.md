It is a healthy sign that common Indian persons including illiterates  
have a deep contempt for British slaves who have no idea about  
anything Indian and they want Indian identity. I am giving some  
examples that no English medium Sanskrit scholar has shown any sign of  
literacy-  
(1)There is complete revulsion for astronomy as it may determine  
chronology. It is thought same as astrology, as in this note.  
(2) Indian history starts with attack by Alexander. Anybody who ever  
reads India fragments of Megasthenes cannot consider British era  
historians as literate. He has described Palibothri on banks of Yamuna-  
it is equated with Patna on Ganga banks. He has also given distance of  
various towns from that which leaves no doubt that he is referring to  
Delhi. He has called it town of Hercules. Pillar of Hercules is Kutub-  
Minar made in 456 BC at start of Sri harsha-shaka.  
(3) There is extreme obsession due to slavish tendency to look only  
towards west to complete British design of proving Indians as  
foreigners and to justify British rule or Arab rule before that. If  
any reference is given about India proper or eastern part, suddenly  
all slave scholars become deaf, dumb and blind. There is a river still  
existing as Iravati whose ‘ti’ has been changed to ‘di’ by Britishers.  
Scholarly pretensions dare not look at that and twist the name to make  
it Ravi.  
(4) Indus valley excavation was done only for west origin of Indians  
and Vedas, irrespective of the fact that nothing was deciphered for 80  
years. Whatever archeological find or interpretation may come, drying  
of a great river cannot be start of a civilization-it can only mean an  
end.  
(5) There is so much stress on archeological evidence. All such  
evidence can be understood only in context of written records which  
are declared unreliable. Archeology is corroboration and further  
details-not elimination of all texts.  
(6) After describing 14 shakas, S.B. Dixit in obedience to British  
masters declared that only Shalivahan year can be called Shaka. This  
obsession has grown so much that Shaka referred by Varahamihir is  
interpreted in shaka starting 90 years after his death. There is a  
story that he could not have published his book without this forgery  
under British rule.  
(7) Sriharsha shaka of 456 BC (Al-Biruni, Abul fazal) is called Shaka  
of Harshavardhana (605-646 AD), who had not started any era as per his  
own writings or from writings of Banabhatta and Huensang.  
(8) Professors reading and teaching Naishadha-charita and  
Mricchakatikam for whole life tell that there is no record about  
Sriharsha and Shudraka. Actually, there is no record whatsoever about  
Chandragupta-2 touted as Vikramaditya except fragments of Prabhavati  
inscription.  
(9) Till Abul fazal, Yudhishthira shaka was well known. Only during  
British rule a frenzy started to change the dates. All calculations of  
panchanga and Vakya-karana start with kali beginning on 17-2-3102 BC,  
Ujjain midnight. Claim of 0.2 degree accuracy is made (15 minute error  
for moon), but it is shifted by 72 years by so called mathematicians  
who have not even tried to look into making of Calender software of  
NASA and ignore 68 hours error for 3100 BC.  
(10) R.C. Mazumdar in his original book ‘Ancient India’, page 135  
quoted Megasthenes to state strength of Army of Andhra kings who had  
come 1000 year after Maurya period. It established Alexander at time  
of Gupta period starting after Alexander. To save his service, he  
took help of two friends from Bengal-K.K. Dutta and H.C. Raychaudhuri  
to write another history book which is now in syllabus in which these  
were suppressed. D. S. Triveda also was chased out from BORI, Pune as  
he had dared to give Indian chronology. Andhra historians take pride  
in quoting Megasthenes about Andhra kings, but reference in Vishnu-  
sahasranama is useless as it is Indian text (Chanura-andhra-  
nishudanah)  
(11) My mother had not studied in any school, but she knew that Gita  
was told by Krishna and written by Vyasa. Radhakrishnan did not knew  
the author and declared Vyasa as legendary, so that his birth date can  
be observed as Teachers day instead of Guru-Purnima. As ignorance and  
destruction of vedic knowledge was useful for British, it was  
published by Oxford whose declared aim is to destroy Indian culture in  
Boden chair of 1831.  
(12) Vedas are considered works of different sects or periods. 21  
shakhas of Rigveda are based on first verse of Shaunaka shakha of  
Atharva veda. Shaunaka and Pippalada shakhas of Atharva are based on  
Dva-suparna sukta of Rigveda.  
(13) Bhagavata mahatmya clearly indicates that Bhakti was born in  
Karnataka-this was known to my mother but not to any fake scholar who  
cannot think beyond Indus valley. A recent publication has stated that  
whole Vedic world was limited within Haryana. This looks funny, but  
that is essence of all British oriented research of Indology.  
(14) Munishvara in Siddhanta sarvabhauma has classified 5 yugas and  
showed their inter-relation. 4 year yuga of Aitareya Brahmana, 5 year  
yuga of yajusha jyotisha and 19 year yuga of Rik-jyotish are well  
known. Bahmanda purana, vayu etc clearly indicate yugas of 2700 years,  
8100 years, 360 years and 12000 years. Without seeing any Indian book  
confusion is created about long eras which are also correct for  
geological periods. At least Asharam bapu knows them-why we should  
hear totally illiterates  
(15) Every day about 200 visitors see Dhauli inscription of maurya  
Ashoka. There is no mention of Kalinga war, number of deaths or  
anything about Buddhism. But any body except a hindu has to be good,  
so he has been declared a bauddha for renouncing violence. Death  
injured figure is placed at 10.5 lakhs which is more than current  
strength of Indian army and the then population of kalinga. That is to  
divert attention from 35 lakh deaths in Orissa in 1865 when there was  
surplus food production.  
(16) There was atotal of about 10 million murders in revenge after  
1857 war. In my village near Ara, 3000 persons were hanged and in  
Gamharia near Moghalsarai 5500 persons were hanged and annual worship  
is still done. But Indian leaders and scholars think only of British  
contribution to rise of India. Only Khaleej Times of Dubai demanded  
apology from British and Nagasaki University published a counter to  
story of economic development under British. Indian slaves cannot  
think of it- Arun

\> Nov. 20, 2010 Respected Scholars, Namaskar! I read all postings related to Patanjali, Mahabhashya and VAsavadattA. When it comes to the ancient India, there are multiple contradicting arguments, contradicting chronology and then suddenly everything starts hanging in the sky including Indra, VaruNa, NAsatya, Vedas. Indian astrologers and astronomers are so smart, when asked question about ancient history of India, they may start from millions of years of SatyaYuga. No hope there either. Modernized Indian writers exposed to the western sciences may talk about Gondavana, roaming dinosaurs in the ancient India, meteorite strikes, rising Himalayas. Orthodox writers may talk about flood of Manu and his fish in connection with the ancient history of India. Mahabharata has interpolations. One does not know what is added when,
by whom, and why? So I decided to find the evidence of Mahabharata outside of the subcontinent of Mahabharata. I found that evidence. Now could you deny that main parties in the epic war were concentrated on the border between the two ancient lands of modern Pakistan and Afghanistan--Sindhu, Sauveera, Shibi, Gaandhaara, Kuru, Kamboja, Vaahlika, Shaka, Shaakala, Tushaara. Ladies kingdom, Mongols, HUNa. Not only that , the connection goes all the way towards the north pole. I am waiting to see if anybody writes about Mongolian connection of Mahabharat. About Sanskrit-Somebody writes Vedas has seven layers of meanings. One has no hope in understanding anything in one life time. Somebody writes that Sanskrit is perfect language and it is Deva bhasshaa. But nobody knows who were Devas? Some say there were here on the earth. Some say they are in sky in their abodes. If in sky no research further. Somebody says Sanskrit came from PraNava-Om. No research further. Indo-European scholars promote the theory that Sanskrit and many other languages came from Proto-Indo-European. Asko Paropola gives talk in Tamilnadu and discusses etymology of "RAsabha" and "Gardabha" . No wonder people would like to listen to holy Babas instead of inviting scholars to give a talk. People say that neither we understand scholars nor we understand holy Babas. But with Babas we may accrue some PuNya. So I went in different direction- I collected evidence of Mahabharata from outside of Indian subcontinent. It was done to find out the ancient places intimately connected with life of Krishna-Pindaaraka Teertha where Saamba received the curse of Musala-mother of Iron. This is very difficult history-Did Krishnas people go outside of the subcontinent? If Arjun can go on Digvijaya, why not Vrishnis, Yaddavas, Maadhavas, and their other clans?With N. R. Joshi not only Mahabharat history make sense, but even the world history starts making sense with reference to Mahabharat. Now about Sanskrit again- With my phonemic symbolism based on acoustic properties of articulated sounds, listeners see some connection between sound and sense of Sanskrit words. They start enjoying beauty of Sanskrit words- Saushabdyam ! I do not touch grammar. Scholars do not agree on grammatical forms and there is evidence that grammatical forms have changed from Vedic to Classical Sanskrit. Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
