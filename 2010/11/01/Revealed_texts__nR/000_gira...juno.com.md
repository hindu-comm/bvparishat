Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



Revealed Texts of Ancient India



Dr. Ramanath (Oct 24, 2010) offered list of revealed texts as words of seers such as Panini, KAtyAyana, Patanjali, Gautam, KaNada, Jaimini, Buddha, MahAvira etc.



My question to him-Would you like to include Vedas and Mahabharat because of Geeta as revealed texts in your list? Thanks. N.R. Joshi.
