Dear Scholars !  
NAMASTHE  
I am a Yoga teacher and healer. During my experience I come accross a  
unique system of healing based on one acienct Yoga Text, which  
principle is yielding better remedy than any other treatment for  
stress-caused health disorders.  
In this connection I wish to develop the method further, so  
as to make it more precesive by co-relating with the CONCEPT OF  
MARMASTHANA available in other ancient health systems of the world, in  
specific to India.  
I humbly request the learned 'pandits' well versed in  
ancient scriptures, to suggest me some direct or indirect sources in  
this respect.  
Further I honestly accept my inebility to go through bare  
sanskrit script without engligh translation. So, again I request  
such books which would readily help me, without much depending on  
sanskrit men.  
HELP ME, HELP THE SICK AND HELP HUMANITY AS A WHOLE.  
With Pranam I remain.
