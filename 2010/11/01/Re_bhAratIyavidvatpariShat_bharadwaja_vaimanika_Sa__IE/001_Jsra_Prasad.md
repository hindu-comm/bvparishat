Namaste.  
  
Whatever is mentioned is truly correct. Srimaharshi Research Institute of Vedic Technology had entered into an MoU with IICT, Hyderabad and now entering into another MoU with University of Hyderabad. Recently they also have started a *jyotirarurveda* ashram in which treatment will be based on *karma vipaka*. Interested may visit their website at <http://www.srivt.org>
