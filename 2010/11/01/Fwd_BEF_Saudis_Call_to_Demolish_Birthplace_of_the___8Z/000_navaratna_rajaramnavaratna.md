Islamic Sites

(AhlulBayt News Agency) - The Saudi Committee for the Promotion of  
Virtue and Prevention of Vice called to demolish seven sacred sites  
under the pretext that they are used as grave-worshipping (practices  
contrary to Wahabbi interpretation of Islam) which is discouraged in  
Saudi Arabia .  
  
Most prominent Wahhabi clerics support this call alleging that the visit  
of graves and other holly shrines and sites , is a kind of atheism  
(Shirk) .  
  
The (CPVPV) calls to :  
  
1- Demolish the Birthplace of the Prophet .  
  
2- Demolish the grave of Amina bint Wahb, the Prophet's mother  
  
2- Enclose the holy mountain Jabal Al Rahma, (the mountain of mercy) ,  
in the plain of Arafat outside Mecca. The pilgrims go to Mount Arafat  
for the culmination of the hajj, symbolizing the final judgment at the  
scene of Muhammad's last sermon 14 centuries ago  
  
3- Enclose Jabal-al-noor (the mountain of light) where the Prophet  
Muhammad received his first revelation from God on this mountain.  
  
4- Put ban on entrance to the graveyard al-Mu'alla in Mecca which  
includes the grave of Sayyida Khadija bint Khuwailid, the wife of the  
Prophet Muhammad .  
  
5- Put ban on entrance to the graveyard of Maimoona which includes the  
grave of (Maimoona), the last wife of the Prophet Muhammad .  
  
6- Change the name of the Graveyard of Eve  
  
7- Demolish the Mosque of bai'a in Mecca .
