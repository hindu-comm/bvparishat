With reference to Kamboja, it is the same which is mentioned by Yaska in Nirukta. The linguistic features mentioned by Yaska shavatirgatikarmaa is preserved in most of the areas in the vicinity of Kamboja. There was a website of Pakistan which preserves most of the characteristics of Kamboja particularly 40 thousands ladies fighting in the battlefield when their hustands died in the battlefield. It has a similarity with the story of Durgaasaptasati where the ladies fought when their males were defeated. It is strange that the word Kambuu is mentioned in the DSS. which is for the region and the caste along with other characters. It is a chapter of the regular history of ancient Kamboja. It continued upto medieval ages when Guru Govinda Singh took the theme in his known mystic work: Chandi di vaara. His biography is Bichitar Natak which has similarity to vichitramidamaakhyaatam. Later on it lost its its geographical identity and was mixed with Cambodia. To me it was a migration from Kamboja to Valabhi and from that place to modern Cambodia. Huge literature of Buddhism was brought along. 1000 viharas were at Vallabhi ( Lamotte). Its history with Pakistan website is to be restored back. Regards, spnarang
