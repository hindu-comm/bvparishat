Its relation to Baas.kala Samhitaa is also there. The Mahabharata speaks of its destruction through Hunas. Baalakhilyas may have some relation to Baas.kaliiyas. Baahliika and Vaahliika are intermixed. It was near Uttaraapatha which was a link through mountains and the origin of the rivers (mukha -- Candra inscription: tiirtvaa saptamukhaani yena samare sindhorjitaaH BaahlikaaH). In the Harsacarita also Harsa stayed at Uttarapatha. Two routes by V.S. Agrawal are interesting ( Harsacarita-- eka samskritika adhyayana ). Its identity is to be reestablished.
