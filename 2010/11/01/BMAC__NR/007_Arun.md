I am unable to place Margiana in Mahabharata or other puranic  
literature.  
There were 4 groups going out from India at time of King Yayati in  
line of Aila Pururava-Anu, Druhyu, Turvasu and Yadu-described in  
Vishnu purana etc. Yayati had married Sharmishtha, daughter of  
Vrishaparva. Vrishaparva may be related to a place name called Vrisha-  
parvata, or Taurus mountains. He was a Danava, not a Daitya-another  
tribe. One of the 14 Indras also had married Shachi,dauhter of Puloma  
Danava. Some have identified Daitya areas as west Europe (Deutsch or  
Dutch) and Danava as region of east Europe around Danube river. These  
names might be ancient and stated as Daitya and Danava. Their regions  
were in west Asia also-Arun

\> October 31, 2010 Respected Scholars, Namaskar! Bactria-Margiana Archaeological Complex Reference-Posting of Dr. D. Bhattacharya dated Oct 27 on this list. I am glad Dr. Bhattacharya, you brought up the subject of BMAC. We had discussion on this topic last year in Dec. 2009. I have the paper of Dr. B.B. Lal-His Inaugural address at the 19th International Conference on South Asian Archaeology,Italy, 2007. He does not go to the ancient names of Bactria and Margiana. So I am asking question first to Shree Arun Upadhaya, then to you and then to other scholars-what were the ancient names of Bactria and Margiana at the time of the epic war? It is said that the name Bactria was given by Greeks. Margiana is Merv (Turkmenistan) of the known history. However I am looking for ancient names.The idea is to understand Mahabharat history. Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
