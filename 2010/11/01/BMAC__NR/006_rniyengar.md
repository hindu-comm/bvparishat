Bashkala Samhita and Bactria  
There is no evidence to connect RV-Bashkala Samhita with Bactria  
equated with Bahlika. ShivapuraaNa categorically states that Bashkala  
was a village or town in a country near the sea coast. The name may  
indicate a connection with RV, but when the PuraaNa was composed it  
was obviously populated with non-Vedic people. Bactria is land locked.

Please See Shiva-purANa (prathama khaNDA Chanchulaa vairaagya  
varNanam, v.2)

SamudranikaTe deshe graamo baashkala sanjn\~akah \|  
Vasanti yatra paapiSTaah vedadharmojjhitaa janaah\|\|

For understanding ancient history and geography we should not stop  
with Puranic tradition. Vedic tradition also has quite a bit to say on  
geography. Assuming Bashkala was Bahlika, why RV Bashkala Samhita  
should be attributed to that town or country? Like Shaakala or  
shaakalya samhita is attributed to a person of that name, Baashkala  
was also the name of a person who promoted that particular branch of  
RV. Shakala as a place name is identified with present day Sialkot in  
Pakistan,  
about which I have not seen any proof. A person being known by the  
name of his birth town is still popular all over India.
