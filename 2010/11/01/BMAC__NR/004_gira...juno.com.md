Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



Baas,kala recension of the Rigveda



Thanks Dr. S.P.Narang. You always bring us new information.



This information isfrom my friend-There is a river by name Baas,gula. The valley of the river is in Kaafiristan (known as Vaamasthaan before). The Bhagavatapurana (12.5.59) refers to the seer Baas.kali having compiled few hymns of Rigveda. Baas.gula tribe lives in the Baas'gula valley of Afghanistan.  
There are many similarities in Kaafiri and Sanskrit words.



In the same line Kuru, Kamboja, Shaka,Vaahlika, Madra, there is country by the name Tus.ara. This is Tokharistan. This is also mentioned in the epic Mahabharata. Tokhars were certainly out ofthe subcontinent.



Research is always upsetting when one finds new information. One such troublesome item is Kuru-kula was sub-branch of Vrika kula of Atri. Vrika means wolf. Turkish people from Turkmenistan believe that they are descendants of wolf. Connection goes further to Uttarkuru king Ila and then to ladies kingdom. Ila had to dress like a queen to conduct affairs of his kingdom. Shantanu was younger brother of Praatipeya Vahlika. Rigveda (10-98-11) calls kula of Shantanu "Aulaana".



There is lot more to do research for our own understanding of our history. There is no point in referring to Aryan invasion theory repeatedly. My research clearly shows that there were two streams of people moving from Asia towards Europe-one from eastern and central Asia (Indo-Iranians) moving westward direction to Ukraine to Finland and the second stream (Indo-Aryans) moving from Gujarat to Arabia to Babylonia to Syria, to Georgia to Lithuania to Macedonia, to Thrace to Greek islands and to Finland in prehistoric times.



All scholars from Europe know that their neolithic civilizations were disappearing in front of people moving from Asia to Europe. Maxmullar, Macaulay is all old stuff. Do not spend time on them. Focus on Mahabharata. Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
