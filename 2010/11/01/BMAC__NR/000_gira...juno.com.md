Respected Scholars, Namaskar!





Bactria-Margiana Archaeological Complex



Reference-Posting of Dr. D. Bhattacharya dated Oct 27 on this list.



I am glad Dr. Bhattacharya, you brought up the subject of BMAC. We had discussion on this topic last year in Dec. 2009. I have the paper of Dr. B.B. Lal-His Inaugural address at the 19th International Conference on South Asian Archaeology,Italy,2007. He does not go to the ancient names of Bactria and Margiana. So I am asking question first to Shree Arun Upadhaya, then to you and then to other scholars-what were the ancient names of Bactria and Margiana at the time of the epic war? It is said that the name Bactria was given by Greeks. Margiana is Merv (Turkmenistan) of the known history. However I am looking for ancient names.

The idea is to understand Mahabharat history. Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
