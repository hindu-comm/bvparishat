*November 1, 2010*



Friends:



 At the outset I must apologize for not being able to respond personally to many greetings received for the Karnataka Rajyotsava Award for my science writing (in Kannada). Even with this list (compiled by a helpful friend), several names are bound to be left out.



 Thanks are due to *Samyukta Karnataka,* especially its chairman the late Sri Haranahalli for encouraging me to write a series of articles on science subjects in Kannada.



 While I am grateful for the recognition, I would have been much happier ifwe hadmore science writers in Kannada (and in other Indian languages). Science journalism is virtually non-existent in Indian languages. This being the case, we cannot really complain if young people are not going into the sciences.



 I have been trying to encourage young people to write on science subjects, but the climate does not seem to encourage science writing. It is a sad fact that Indian journalism is dominated by political hacks.



 I appeal both to the state governments and to private individuals and foundations to institute fellowships, awardsand other incentives for promising science writers. It is not a healthy sign for a senior scientist like myself to be one of the few writing science articles.



 Once again I want to remember with fondness the vision of Sri Haranahalli Ramaswamy. It is our duty to encourage young writers totake up science writing.



Sincere regards,

N.S. Rajaram
