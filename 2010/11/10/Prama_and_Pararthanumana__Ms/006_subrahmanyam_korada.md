Dear Dr Narayanan

I have translated Brahmakanda of Vakyapadiyam in 1992 . It was published by --

Sri Sadguru Publications  
Indian Book Center  
40/5, Shakti Nagar  
Delhi - 110 007  
cost Rs 140/-  
The work is altogether different from earlier translations --

each verse is preceded by Introduction , that gives the mind of the  
author and/or maitains cohesion among the verses , as the case may be  
. Summary of the verse is given at the  
second stage . Commentary is added, wherein the cryptic meaning is  
explicated . At the final stage Notes , which gives the  
derivative/etymological meaning of certain terms, is appended .

Dr Rajendran

That's right . In fact , most of the literature is related to Anumana  
and Naiyayikas enjoy  
Anumiti . Even Anandavardhana's Dhvani theory was not spared  
(anumAne'ntarbhAvayitum) .

Pratyaksamapyartham vidvAnIkseta yuktitah -- Vakya . Vakyakandah .

Presently I am doing a book - Pramanas in Indian Philosophy , right  
from Vedas to Ramayana to Darsanas to Vedangas to Tantra .
