The Western Philosophers believe more in Tarka (Logic / Reasoning)  
than Pratyaksa , which for them is - practical experience or empirical  
study . Even the latter , some of them argue , should be followed by  
Tarka . Such a cognition only is authoritative .

ParArthAnumAnam is called Syllogism in Aristotle's jargon . Acording  
to Aristotle there will be a Major Premise and a Minor Premise (  
followed by a conclusion ) --

All men are mortal  
Socrates is a man  
Socrates is mortal

Aristotle first cognizes 'hetu' as invariably concomitant with  
'sAdhya' (in the major premise) and then finds this invariably  
concomitant 'hetu' in a particular place in the minor --  
he first makes sure of 'vyApti' as a general truth and then determines  
the existence of this  
'sAdhya- vyApya - hetu' on the 'paksa' .

NyAya -- first 'paksadhaarmatA of the 'hetu' is known and then the  
recollected notion of 'vyApti' is added to it --  
vyAptivisistapaksadharmatA .

Aristotle -- 'paksadharmatAvisistavyApti .

I discussed both the things in my book , viz. Theories of Language :  
Oriental and Occidental .

NyAya means / refers to - parArthAnumanajanaka - pancAvayava - mahAvAkyam .
