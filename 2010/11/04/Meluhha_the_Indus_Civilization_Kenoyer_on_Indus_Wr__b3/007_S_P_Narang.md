the nomenclature of fauna and flora is rapidly changed. It takes the local names, figurative names, structural name. The best is Neema = azadirichta Indica: which is from sanskrit: Saadhuvrksa> Persian: azaada darakhta \> botanical name. Popular names are different. Even in Sanskrit and Tamil, the problem of identity of flora is problematic. they change with the change of time. recently I associated with Gannaa = sugar-cane due to an influence of Gandhaar. Similar is Gandaa in Panjabi vis a vis Pyaj = onion. These are most usable items. A few words can be checked from the dictionary of Tfurner: Indo-aryan available online. Regards, spnarang
