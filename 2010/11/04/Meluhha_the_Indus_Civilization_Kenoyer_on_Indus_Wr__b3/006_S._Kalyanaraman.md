Scholarly basis is this: IE linguists like Colin Masica and Southworth are not able to trace most of the flora, fauna, agriculture-related words of Hindi or Urdu into the 'known' glosses attributed to Indo-Aryan or Dravidian or Austro-Asiatic language families. Hence, Language 'X' as an unknown language family is assumed as the cause for this aberration. The IE analytical method is spelt out in the books cited.

  

Another IE linguist FBJ Kuiper finds a significant number of words in Sanskrit derived from Austro-Asiatic (Munda).*Kuiper*, FBJ, Proto-*Munda*words in Sanskrit, Amsterdam, 1948. Nahali is considered a language isolate though it contains 50% Indo-Aryan, 25% Dravidian and 25% Munda words:*Kuiper*, F. B. J. "*Nahali*: A Comparative Study". Med. Kon. Ned. Akad. Wetenschappen 1962, 25(5): 239-352. Noord-Hollandsche, Amsterdam.

  

This scholarly basis is part of the Indo-European linguistic repertoire.
