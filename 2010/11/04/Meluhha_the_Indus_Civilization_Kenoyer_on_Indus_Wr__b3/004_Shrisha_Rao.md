It would be considered a loan-word from Vedic, like जनिता, etc. This is all subject to the division between proto-IE, Vedic, Epic, Classical, etc., which traditional Sanskrit scholars (as opposed to those whose background is primarily in Greek, Latin, etc.) do not accept, so I guess we can call it अभ्युपगमवाद.

If the word occurs in another Indic language, then it is presumably a loan-word from Hindi.

This issue is also tangential to the main question, which is: what scholarly basis exists to say that 60% of Hindi words have no cognates?
