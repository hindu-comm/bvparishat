Interesting material, thanks. I am however puzzled by the statement  
(p. 3 of the PDF that was attached): "60% of the words in Hindu and  
Urdu cannot be traced to any known language families." Does this  
claim look right to you? What is the original source (book/paper) on  
which it is based?

The conventional wisdom is that most words in Hindi are derived from  
Sanskrit (not only nouns, but also हि becoming ही, अपि becoming भी,  
etc.) and most in Urdu from Parsi. Hindi does have certain unique  
features, among them the lack of declension unlike many other  
languages, with cases being indicated by a separate word (रामेण बाणेन  
becoming राम के बाण से, etc.). There are also unusual words in Hindi,  
perhaps the best example being the Vedic अच्छा that is not found in  
classical Sanskrit or in other Indic languages (except indirectly, as  
a loan-word from Hindi). However, these facts do not automatically  
suggest that a majority of Hindi words do not have cognates (as seems  
to be claimed about Basque and some other languages).

By the way, the Ethnologue catalog (available in printed form, or  
online at <http://www.ethnologue.com>) has the following to say about  
Hindi:

Formal vocabulary borrowed from Sanskrit, de-Persianized,  
de-Arabicized. Literary Hindi, or Hindi-Urdu, has 4 varieties: Hindi  
(High Hindi, Nagari Hindi, Literary Hindi, Standard Hindi); Urdu;  
Dakhini; Rekhta. “Hindustani”, though not listed separately in India,  
refers here to the unofficial lingua franca of northwest India. Has a  
lexical mixture in varying proportions of Hindi (vocabulary derived  
from Sanskrit) and Urdu (vocabulary derived from Persian or Arabic).

Some people might not appreciate the missionary motives of the  
people/organizations behind this catalog, and I hold no brief for the  
same, but this is an authoritative document in the same sense that the  
CIA World Factbook is considered authoritative even by people who do  
not like the CIA or the United States Government in general.
