In Bhavishya purana, Pratisarga Parva and various tantra Texts like  
Shakti-sangama, bahlika is identified as Balkha town in Persia. King  
Bhoja of Malva had gone to Bahlika with 10000 troops, when Prophet  
Mohammed saought his help. many among his army helped in his crusade-  
who were called Mohyali as per Islamic History published by Ahmedia  
sect-Arun
