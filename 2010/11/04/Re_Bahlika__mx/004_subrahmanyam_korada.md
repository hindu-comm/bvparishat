BAhlika / BAhlIka -- BAhIka -VAhIka

Amarakosa says (2-Vaisya) bAhlikam is Asaphotida / Hingu -

sahasravedhi jatukam bAhlikam hingu ramatham - here the derivation is  
- the one that has come from the country - bAhlika . RAmatham means -  
the one that has come from the country  
'rama.tha .  
The other meaning of BAhlikam / BahkIkam is saffron ( from 'bahlikadesa' ) -  
Amara - 2- Manusya - kasmIrajanmAgnisikham varam bahlikapItanam

Still another meaning is - the horse from "BAhlikadesa' -  
Amara - 2- Ksatriya - vanAyujah pArasIkAh kAmbhoja bAhlikA hayAh  
Amara - NAnArtha - bAhlikam rama.the'pi ca.

PAninisUtram - vAhIkagrAmebhyasca (4-2-117) - KaumudI - bAhIkagrAmebhyasca .  
Under 'dityadityAdityapatyuttarapadA.n.nyah ' ( 4-1-85) -

The people of VAhIkadesa are considered to be 'adhamAdhikArinah' ,

I do not know as what the term is that is used for Prophet Mohammad in  
PurAnas but one should be very careful in such matters --  
on 27/11/2008 (significant)I was invited by a Muslim Organization to  
represent Hindu Religion  
(also someone to speak on Christianity) . The Muslim speaker quoted  
Ravisankar and said  
that a Sanskrit word in Vedas (all) refers to Mohammad and there were  
so many such Prophets  
earlier , i.e. since time immemorial .  
Pundit Ravisankar should have not said so .
