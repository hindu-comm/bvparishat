It is very correct that the MBH and the Puranas are trying to collect the material including the geographical and sociological from various sources including the oral. Most of the themes are lost in due course of time and should be collected from various sources including the Buddhist and Jains and scattered in Tibet and Chinese. I remeber an important custum of Panjab recited at Lohri(Sundari Mundri)which had its origin in China and Tibet and came to Panjab and available even today. It may be available in full or part in any language in idiom or practice. The custom of Siappa from Oxus is in Panjab today which is found to some extent in Striiparvan of the MBH and Rudaalii in Rajasthan and other regions. Thanks to Vyasa who tried to collect the heritage at one place. Regards, spnarang
