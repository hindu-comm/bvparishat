Respected Scholars,  
  
How long the Ayodhya related posts would continue?  
  
**It is true that:**  
\>Ignorance of law is no defense. But going by the ill-informed discourse that is on after the Ayodhya verdict, it appears as if ignorance is the best excuse to pontificate on the judgement and to pour scorn on the law and those who interpret it.

**And it is well articulated.  
  
To arrive at the correct reading after warding off all possible misinterpretations would be as futile as waiting along the sea shore for the waves to subside to take bath!  
  
Pardon me if I am outspoken.  
  
Pranams.  
  
**
