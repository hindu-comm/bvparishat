namo vidvadbhyah



That is the **SidddhAnta** . Why ? because whatever is being quoted here is from **Vedas**(**Apauruseya)** and treatises authored by **Rsis / Yogins** , i.e. who have got '**Divyadrsti**'

(clairvoyance) and **Yogidrsti**(can see beyond and beyond ) and who do not bluff / glorify .



A **jnAnI should not try for 'vikhyApanam' ( 4 AdhyAya, SAnkarabhAsyam**) .



Weare supposed to maintain the balance - if thereis **'superiority coplex** ' then it is

**'dambhah' ( itarebhyah svasya AdhikyabhAvanA** ) and ' **inferiority complex** ' is not

allowed - **AtmAnam nAvamanyeta'** .



In case you do not accept our version then let someone from '**outside**' do a maching work

to **AstAdhyAyi / Yogadarsanam / SusrutasamhitA** etc.- no revision is accepted (**acAryAh** **idAnIm krtvA na nivartayanti (MahAbhAsyam**) .



How longer can you go depending onlyon Archeology etc ?Nice to take if available

and should continue the effort .



How can you take your memory as a yardstick and doubt great people like VyAsa , KAlidAsa and remark - **there were two VyAsas and more KAlidAsas than one** ?



Would you be convinced if today a man from this land teaches **four SAstras in four Languages without break (selecting the most difficult aspects) ?**



It is hightime - put up or .......



Here, there hasbeen an uninturrepted tradition and it is inhereted
thru '**gurusisyaparamparA**' .



**'Janako ha vaidehah'** ( TaittirIya - kAthaka) , **devAnAm pUrayodhyA tasyAgm hiranmayah** **kosah** ' (TaittirIyAranyakam - 1) etc. Even SankarAcArya discusses this aspect in 2 nd AdhyAya .  


**'SaptadvIpA vasumatI'** (MahAbhAsyam - PaspasA) , '**vAhIkagrAmebhyasca**' (Pan 4-2-16), **prAcAm , udIcAm** (Panini) etc.



The word '**vAhIka**' means **'bAhya'** ( see -'strIpumsAbhyAm nansnanau bhavanAt' Panini

4-1-87) . It may be the same as '**bAhlika'** in MahAbhAratam .



**GAndhAra** is 'kAndahAr' , **KAmbhoja or Kamboja** is 'KampUchiyA' etc.



It is neither logical nor wise to try to adjust the States mentioned in MahAbhArata to the

present India .
