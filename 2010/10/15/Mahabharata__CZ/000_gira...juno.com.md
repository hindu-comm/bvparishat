Respected Scholars, Namaskar!

The Book " Geographical Survey of the Puranas," by Dr. Savitri Saxsena

In the introduction of the book, the author says," We see that from Vedas upto the classical Kaavyas, Sanskrit writers have thrown light on the geography of their own period in one way or the other. The "horizon of Vedic Geography extended beyond the limits of India and included plateau of Iran and the tableland of Central Asia."

So here I am referring to the book of Indian author and not to the western author. Everybody trying to understand nations described in the epic Mahabharat feels that one cannot squeeze all them in the northern part of the subcontinent. Some of them existed distinctly out of the subcontinent and in the west.

The author also adds that although Puranas offer names of sacred places, rivers, mountains, they are silent regarding their details. Puranas offer a long list of Janapadas, but nowhere a specific location is assigned to them.

In short there is problem. Not everything is fine and dandy as patriotic writers tell us to believe. The author also assumes Aryan migration to the subcontinent from outside. I did not assume that in my search.

Please understand we are here to search the truth as much as we can. Patriotic answers and astronomical calculations alone from Satya Yuga to 2010 AD do not solve the problem. Thanks. N.R.Joshi
