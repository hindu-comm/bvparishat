Respected Scholars Namaskar!

Dear Dr.D. Bhattacharya,  
I am sorry. My problem is that I do not keep postings on my computer. I print them out. Because I cannot read all of them on the same day. However I gave the reference to Dr. Arun Upadhyaya's website {www. [scribd.com/Arunupadhyay](http://scribd.com/Arunupadhyay)\]. In his posting on this list he mentioned about 5 Janemejaya inscriptions and gave his website. So I visited it and then posted my views here. I will try to improve myself.

Dear Dr. R. N. Iyengar,  
To the best of my knowledge last year on this list one Acharya posted about Rus'ama in connection with my posting on Indra and Lady soldiers from Rigveda. (Dr. Moharir has this reference from Rigveda.) I am thankful to Dr. D. Bhattacharya for showing connection of Kurus, Indra and Rus'ma on this list today. I found the same information through my research. I am happy about it now.

Dr. Iyengar, you mentioned lake Sharyanvanti in your posting dated Sept 25, 2010 (Asura in Rigveda). Where was the location of this lake? This question is far all. My research shows it was in  
the ancient Afghanistan connected with the ancient Harahati (Saraswati) river of Afghanistan.

Dear Dr. Narang,  
Your postings are valuable like those of many other scholars on this list. In your posting dated Sept 26, 2010 \[N. R.Joshi and Durgasaptasat----} you referred to the episode of defeat of Indra and the location was between Kashmir and Balakh. Could you please kindly tell us where was Balakh and what is its modern name? I gave location of war as the Pamirs.

Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
