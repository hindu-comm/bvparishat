Respected Scholars, Namaskar!

Janamejaya inscriptions described in the posting of Dr. Arun Upadhyaya.

I looked into the website \[ www. [scribd.com/Arunupadhyaya](http://scribd.com/Arunupadhyaya).

Third in the line is the posting "Janamejaya Inscriptions".It is posted by Dr. A. Upadhyaya. I read it. I am puzzled.

There are scholars on this list like Dr. Kalyanramn and Dr,N. Rajaram who keep the track of the ancient inscriptions.  
Dr Rajaram in his posting dated February 28, 2010 \[on FHRS_USA\] wrote, " --------we do not have many artifacts from before 3000 BC---- Please see the above posting-certain dates are prior to 3000 BC.

There are no photos of inscriptions. There is text written in Sanskrit and in Devanagari script. There are no photos of copper plates. If these inscriptions are authentic, Dr, Kalyanraman and Dr.Rajaram can use them in their writings. Could any scholar check the authenticity of these inscriptions. I read all books of Sree Talgeri. I did not find Janamejaya inscriptions in them. Indian archaeologist Dr.B.B. Lal never talked about them. Certainly at present Dr. B.B.Lal is not Oxford loyalist. Thanks. N.R. Joshi.
