 It is important now to show these 'distinguished' historians as distinguished by incompetence-- on Ayodhya and the Aryan invasion. Don't demonize them which turns them into larger than life figures, but expose their incompetence and show them as petty courtiers who owe their 'eminence' to political patronage rather than realaccomplishment.



 In the case of Thapar, it is easy. She knows no science (genetic evidence)and noSanskrit. R.S. Sharma is a mercenary, a paid agent of the Babri Masjid Action Committee.
