\> Apart from the occurrence of the name of the Ruśamas in RV 5.30, they are mentioned in association with the Kurus in the Khilas of the Rigveda and the Kuntāpa hymns of the Śaunakīya Atharvaveda. One gets clear indication of the closeness of the Ruśamas and the Kurus also in the Pañcaviṃśa-Brāhma¸a (25.13). There was a contest between Indra and Ruśamā as to who could go round the earth quicker. Indra did his job in the natural way while Ruśamā just went around the land of the Kurus. Since the land of the Kurus was as great as the whole earth, both emerged as winners.
