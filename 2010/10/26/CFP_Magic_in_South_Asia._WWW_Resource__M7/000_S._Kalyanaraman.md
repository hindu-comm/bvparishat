Call for Papers (Articles) for an edited volume on "Magic" in South Asia  
  
Deadline for proposals:December 1, 2010  
  
Deadline for manuscript submission:February 1, 2011  
  
A major university press in the U.S. has asked me to circulate a CFP and  
prepare a proposal for a volume of originalscholarly articlesexploring the problem of "magic" in the cultures andhistory of South Asia. A number of scholars representing various disciplines withinSouth Asian Studieshave begun to focus their attention on this problem in recent years, and the time has come to bring forth some of their fascinating work in a publication.  
  
The panels on magic which I have organized for theAnnual Conferenceon  
South Asia at Madison, during the last several years, have suggested that  
there is both ample material for such a volume and a widespread and lively  
interest in the topic.  
  
At present I am seeking original articles, not accepted for publication  
elsewhere, of between 8,000 and 10,000 words. The submission of finished,  
well-polished conference papers is strongly encouraged. I would like to set  
a deadline of February 1, 2011 for manuscripts, so that a proposal can be  
sent to the publisher byMarch 30, 2011. This would hopefully allow for  
approval of the project by the beginning of the summer, enabling  
contributors to undertake necessary revisions during the summer holidays.  
  
Once the publisher accepts the project, a style guide will be made available  
to contributors. However, it would be wise to prepare manuscripts according  
to the usual norms of the majoracademic publishing houses.  
  
For the purposes of this volume, the subject of "magic" is broadly defined to include stage magic, miracles, the "supernatural," "wonders," etc. Papers rooted in religious studies, anthropology, literature, history, and related disciplines are encouraged. Since the subject of "magic" is as yet undefined within the study of South Asia, articles that engage this theoretical problem are of particular interest.  
  
Before submitting an article, please submit by e-mail an initial proposal  
(up to 250 words) including the following: 1) Your name and institutional  
affiliation, 2) A summary of your topic and argument, and 3) The current  
status of your paper and a realistic estimation of the work that remains to  
be done. This should be done by December 1, 2010.  
  
Proposals will be evaluated according to the following criterion:  
1) Research and scholarship, 2) Originality, 3) "Fit" with the other articles, and 4) Likelihood of completion by the deadlines.  
  
Proposals should be sent to:

I look forward to hearing from all interested parties.
