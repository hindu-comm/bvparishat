Namah vidvadbhyaH,

I have been searching for Sri Jaidayal Dalmia's booklet - A Review of  
'Beef Eating in Ancient India'. There is an e-copy available in the  
Internet Archives (Million Book archives) but that copy is rather  
unusable / illegible (esp when a printout is taken). Request the  
scholars here to suggest a way to get a copy of the booklet published  
in 1971 by Gita Press.

Also, I'd like to know if D.N.Jha has perused / criticized the above  
booklet in his work.

dhanyavAdAH,  
Krishna
