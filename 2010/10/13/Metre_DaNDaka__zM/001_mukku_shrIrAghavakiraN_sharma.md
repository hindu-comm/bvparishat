A dandaka, to my knowledge, like any other poem in Samskrtam consists of four paadas. All four paadas share the same gana pattern. Each paada *may* start with one or two na (000) ganas followed by an indefinite number of one of the three ganas -- ta (110), ra (101) and ya (011). Here I used 0 to represent a laghu and 1 to represent a guru.

  

It looks like the dandaka meter does not necessarily have four paadas when it comes to Telugu.

  

Kalidasa's Shyamalaa Dandaka is very famous.
