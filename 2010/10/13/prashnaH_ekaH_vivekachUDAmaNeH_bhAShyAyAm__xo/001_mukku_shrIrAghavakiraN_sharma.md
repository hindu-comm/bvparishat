namO gurubhyaH  

  

Here I try to interpret what the sentences mean.Mukhaja, baahujaata and oorujaata refer to the three classes of people -- brahmanas, kshatriyas and vaishyas -- as the Purusha Sooktam puts it. (braahmano'sya mukham aaseet, baahoo raajanyah krtah, ooroo tat asya yat vaishyah).Hence, a loose translation goes like this.

  

The dharma of wearing sacred Vaishnava marks is prescribed for brahmanas, it is not a must for kshatriyas and vaishyas. It is thus said following the smrtis.
