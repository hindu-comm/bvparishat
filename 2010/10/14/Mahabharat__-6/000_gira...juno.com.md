Respected Scholars, Namaskar!

First I would like to thank Dr.S. Korada for telling us the finer points from the verse of Amarkosha giving synonyms of Copper. I always learn new things from his postings.

Second, Prof Naranga and others interested in the history of Mahabharata. The book "Geographical Survey of the Puranas " by Dr. Savitri Saxsena is full of details. One must read this book. I read similar book few years ago written by Dr. Singh.

However there is problem in locating ancient cities at present locations in the subcontinent . There is no problem with the ancient south India and North east India. The problem starts in the Northwest area. It becomes acute with the area of Khyber pass and beyond.

At present Bharata means only truncated India after 1947. Before 1947 Pakistan was included in Bharata. At the time of Mahabharata, the ancient country Bharata might have included lands of Afghanistan, Iran, Turkmenistan, Central Asia etc. So when I say this river is Afghanistan or this country mentioned in Mahabharata is now in Afghanistan, that does not mean that I am trying to put down the ancient history of Bharata.

There is another country on this earth which claims that it had the Golden city (Dwaraka) buried under its soil. Were there two El Dorados or one? It two where is the second one? If one which one? Do not bombard me. I read book of Dr. S.R.Rao and his exploration of Dwaraka under water near coastal area of Gujurata. I also read remarks of his colleagues about the exploration. Purpose of writing here to find out if anybody other than myself thought about the second Golden city. Please trying to understand me.Thanks. N.R.Joshi
