 Witzel's outpourings are not worth refutation. He has been reiterating the same discredited positions for years on all topics. In my few encounters with him, I found him quite befuddled and still harping about his 2000 *Frontline* article which both he and his sponsor N.Ram seem to regard as the crown jewel of his career. I told him he could keep it.



So let us not waste time arguing with him. He and his ilk keep citing Indo European words as though they have found them on IE texts and/or inscriptions, but in reality they exist only in their imagination.

  
 There are other things we can do. Next summer (2011) the Center for Indic Studies is hosting a **Conference on Origins of Civilization,** and another on **Science and Vedanta.**



 That is where the future lies, not AIT, AMT and debates with their advocates which are on their way to the dustbin of history.
