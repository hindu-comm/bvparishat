The book: :The Emergence of Semantic Traditions in Four Linguistic Traditions, Hebrew, Sanskrit, Greek, Arabic" Publisher: John Benjamins, Amsterdam 1997

The article on Sanskrit semantics is written by Dr. Jan Houben-of University of Leiden (pp50-145 and extensive Bibliography.

On page130, He says, " For the MImAmsA thinkers, as for the grammarians, the verb is the central element in a sentence. However, while the grammarians take the verbal root and the activity expressed by it as more important than the verbal ending and its meaning, to the MImAmsA thinkers it is the latter which is the more important. For the thinkers of NyAya, it is not the verb which is the central element in the sentence but , generally speaking, the noun in the first ending (nominative)."

Are any comments on this observation by Dr. Houben? Thanks. N.R.Joshi
