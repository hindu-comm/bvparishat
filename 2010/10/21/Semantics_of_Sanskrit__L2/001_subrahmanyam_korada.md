namo vidvadbhyah  
  
As far as VyAkaranam and MImAmsA are concerned there is not much to comment .  
  
As per NyAya , he just said what is generally said by even most of the traditional scholars  
- for them it is not only nominative ALWAYS , at times it can be AkhyAta or NipAta etc.  
  
The origin is there in Niruktam - bhAvapradhAnamAkhyAtam, sattvapradhAdnAni nAmAni,  
yatrobhe bhAvapradhAne bhavatah . NaiyAyikas do not follow this strictly .  
  
For VaiyAkaranas - AkhyAtam means dhAtuh , for MImAmsakas it is tin etc.  
  
It was GangesopAdhyAya of 11 th Century who for the first time registered the three SAbdabodhas .
