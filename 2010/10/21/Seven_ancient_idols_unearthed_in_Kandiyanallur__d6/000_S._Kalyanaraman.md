Seven idols, apparently panchaloha, and other pooja accessories were unearthed in Kandiyanallur village, Vandavasi taluk, on Wednesday.

A resident was scooping soil at a site around an ancient dilapidated Siva temple in the village with the help of an earthmover when he stumbled upon an idol.

As the news spread, villagers thronged the spot and dug up further to find a total of seven idols and 19 temple accessories. The idols were of Lord Siva, Parvathi, Vinayaka and Amman.

Villagers took the idols and accessories to to a village temple for worship. Officials, including Tahsildar M. Murugesan and DSP Panneerselvam, were among those who visited the village.

Mr. Murugesan told*The Hindu*only experts should decide whether these metallic idols were panchaloha or not.
