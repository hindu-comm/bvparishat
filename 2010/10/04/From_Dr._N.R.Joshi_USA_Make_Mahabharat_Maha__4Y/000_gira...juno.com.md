Respected Scholars, Namaskar!

\(1\) Many thanks to Dr.Rani Sadashiv Murthy for listing seven streams of Saraswati. Could you identify them now in India? You have offered regions. At least could you show us where was the Sangama of Oghavati and Saraswati? At present in India we have only dried bed of Hakra-Gaghara now identified as Vedic Saraswati. So where is the Sangama? Are you going to say Sangama is dried up too?

I say those seven streams you descibed are in Afghanistan. (Please remember nation Afghanistan did not exist at the time of Mahabharat but in that land there were small kingdoms of different clans). Vimalodaka is current Bamiyan. Surenu became Herava. Arghandab is the ancient Oghavati invoked by Arjun for Bhisma lying on bed of arrows(Shalya parva) There is Sangama of Sarawati and Oghavati in Afghanistan. It was holy place for Iranian and Indians Aryans and in the known history to Persians and Parthians and then for Zoroastrians and then again for Christians.

\(2\) Dear Dr. Iyengar, Your ability to connect astronomical data, geological events to some of rituals (like Darbha in south west direction) is very special. So let us assume that Lake Sharyanvant was on Indian Saraswati. In the known history the Persian empire was extended to only lower part od Sindha because Daurius wanted to have elephants. So the easternmost Satrapies were Hindus and Harahati. Would you like to bring Persian Empire to occupy regions of Indian Sarawati too? Persians never wanted to enter the subcontinent. They limited themselves to Kubha (Kabul) region. So only explanation for the name of their Harahati satrapi was the river Harahati (Saraswati) from Afghanistan (Afghanistan name is not Persian name). And what is wrong in having two Sarawatis-one in the subcontinent and other in Afghanistan? And there is Saraswati country in today's Europe and even there are Ganga, Yamuna in Europe. The land from Kazakhstan was also known as the land of seven rivers (Semirech'ye) in the ancient time and Aryan presence was attested by archeology.

\(3\) Dear Dr.D. Bhattacharya, Please pardon me.You do not have to use that language. There is respect in my heart for you. Thank you for your posting and mentioning Amazon. One more information-Indra stayed secretly in Ladies kingdom in the dress of a lady. Expand Mahabharat and make it Maha. Then you really start enjoying.Thanks. N.R.Joshi

\(4\) One cannot afford to ignore archaeology. It came handy in the case of Ramajanmabhumi. Thanks to Dr. B.B. Lal. N.R.Joshi
