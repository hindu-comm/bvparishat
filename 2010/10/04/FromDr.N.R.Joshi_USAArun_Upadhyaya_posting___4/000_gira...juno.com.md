Dear Shree Arun Upadhyaya, Namaste!

Nobody is questioning your scholarship or your knowledge of astronomy. There are other scholars on this list who know astronomy like you. When their knowledge and your knowledge become complementary to each other then we benefit. I am not here to criticize anybody. I am here to collect knowledge.  
Now I have question for you-Reference-Your posting dated Sept 7-From Dr.N.R.Joshi

You mentioned, " Its time (destruction of Assyrian Empire) has been calculated as 612 BC. The destroyer has been called king of Medes which was east of Indus. In Indian chronology of Rajasthan kings, it was Chahman of Delhi in 612 BC who destroyed Nineve"

Questions (1) Was Chahman the king of Medes? Is Medes here the name of land east of Indus or Medes was clan or family name of Chahman or it was just used as adjective (like brave king)  
(2) To the best of my knowledge Medes were in the western Iran and in the immediate east of Assyrian Empire.  
(3) If Medes (land or people) were in the subcontinent (east of Indus) I would like to have more information on them if you have it. Medes had earlier ancient name. Do you have information on that? If yes please post. Thanks.  
These questions are other scholars too. Thanks.N.R.Joshi
