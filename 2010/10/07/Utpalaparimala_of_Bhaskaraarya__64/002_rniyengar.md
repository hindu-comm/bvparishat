Please do check up. This may give some lead. Pingree in his Census  
lists Telugu and Grantha manuscripts of the Sanskrit text. I have the  
text of BS with Utpala's commentary (KC Dvivedi, Varanasi edition). My  
interest is to see how Bhaskara Yogi's commentary handles "Ketuchaara"  
which I continue to research out of scientific curiosity. Thanks in  
advance.

I had recommended the book for our University library. I do not remember if it was endowed with the said commentary. I may check the publication detail at the Library but that will be possble only tomorrow. I do not know if this will be of any help to you.
