The above is a commentary on Brihatsamhita of VM. (Late)Dr.KV Sharma  
had recommended the above work for my reading. So far I have not  
succeeded in locating a copy of the published work.Recently I learnt  
the manuscript has been edited by Dr.Narayanankutty. Has the work been  
printed? Details including the email address of Dr.Kutty would be  
helpful.  
  
Thanks
