To: [bvparish...@googlegroups.com]()  
  
  
Hello Sir,  
  
My name is Shiju Alex and I am a volunteer of Malayalam wikipedia and  
its sister projects.  
  
I am not sure whether you are aware that apart from Wikipedia, there  
is another wiki project called Wikisource ([http://en.wikipedia.org/  
wiki/Wikisource](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikisource)) available for most of the languages. Wikisource is a  
wiki that is used for collecting the ancient documents/books available  
in a particular language.  
  
Even though Sanskrit has rich tradition, wikisource for Sanskrit is  
not yet started. So I am in the process of starting the Sanskrit  
Wikisource. But to make the Wikisource for Sanskrit an active project,  
help from interested people is required. I know that your group has  
many people who are scholars in Sanskrit. Some of them might be  
interested to join the Sanskrit wikisource project. I request you to  
kindly ask the members of your group to send an email to me at  
[shijual...@gmail.com]() if they are interested in Sanskrit  
wikisource project.  
  
Please let me know if you have any queries.  
  
  
Thank you very much  
Shiju Alex

ततः स्वधर्मं कीर्तिं च हित्वा पापमवाप्स्यसि।।

तस्मादुत्तिष्ठ कौन्तेय युद्धाय कृतनिश्चयः।

निराशीर्निर्ममो भूत्वा युध्यस्व विगतज्वरः।। (भ.गी.)
