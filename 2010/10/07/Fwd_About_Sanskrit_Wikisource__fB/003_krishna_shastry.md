Sanskrit Wikipedia is a great idea and it is a great opportunity for us to further the cause of Samskrit.  
Samskrita Bharati, with the help of Mr Arun Ramarathnam,a Technology Enthusiast and Wikipedian, ** had conducted a one day workshop cum training program for 22 persons in Bengaluru a few weeks ago, though not much progress took place after wards.  
Samskrit Promotion Foundation had organised a one day seminar of Vice Chancellors of Samskrit Universities on 12th September in Delhi in on order to discuss "Opportunities and possibilities for the growth Sanskrit Universities and other institutions in the 21st century", wherein Mr Arun Ramarathnam had made a brief presentation on how Technology could be used for the development of Samskrit, with Wikipedia as a main source/tool. It was decided in that meeting that a workshop cum training will be held during the "World Samskrit Book Fair" to be held from 7th to 10th January 2011 in Bengaluru.(See [www.samskritbookfair.org](http://www.samskritbookfair.org) for details of the WSBF)  
Regarding Samskrit Wikipedia, there are two major concerns, one is that getting more number of enthusiastic and knowledgeable persons who can translate into Samskrit, and upload to the web and the second, most importantly, writing in CURRECT (dosharahita) Samskrit. See the first/front page of Samskrit Wekipedia now, you will hardly find NIRDUSHTA Samskritam words!!! Some words there will pain you like "adyasya vaarta pashyatu" Hence do not hurry please, we will shortly arrange a meeting of the enthusiastic persons and will do it in a collective and systematic way.  
Pl wait for the announcement.
