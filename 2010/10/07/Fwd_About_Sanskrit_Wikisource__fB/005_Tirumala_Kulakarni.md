By seeing these lines I think Wikisource aims at "collecting the ancient documents/books". It is different from the structure of wikipedia.

At this point I have a question - there is a large size of corpus of Sanskrit documents available on net already. It includes, text, pdf, tif and scanned files of Sanskrit texts. Listing these links in a systematic way may fulfill the उद्देश्य of Wikisource. Isn't it?  
  
For instance - <http://sanskrit.inria.fr/portal.html> - this page lists almost all links to Sanskrit resources.
