Dear Rani Sadasivamurty Sir  
  
Wiki source is an internationally supported movements.  
If we start our own Wikisource type of a project we have to worry about physical storage facility etc.. But if we collaborate with Wikisources and other Wikipedia projects we need not to worry about this. All the technical help for the project will be given by people across the glob. Aprt from that we can ensure that our knowledge will be preserved for aged through a digital medium too.  
  
Wikimedia project is a large success in the entire history of World Wide Web. It contains more artciles than Encyclopedia Britanica.  
The people who is working behind aims to provide a free Encyclopaedia to people who is in thirst of knowledge.  
  
The person who send the mail regarding to this project is known internationally for his Wikipedia activity. He is co-ordinating the activities of Malayalam wikipedia. He helped the language to attain a good position in digital presence.  
  
I request all the students and scholers in this community to contribute to the Wikisource
