Dear scholars,  
I am aware of all the contents that Manya Srinivas Varkhedi ji had written and I appreciate them.  
The first letter by Mr Shiju Alex was reg Wikisource(Wikisource is a wiki that is used for collecting the ancient documents/books available in a particular language.) which is a sister project of Wikipedia, as mentioned below. I wrote mainly regarding Wikipedia. But as every one of us agree that the need for "samskritasamskritam" does remain same every where, whether it is Wikipedia or Wikisource, especially when it goes to public domain. At the same time, it is also true that the "correction" follows the "use" and not vice versa. I agree the suggestion that there is no need to "wait" for any body or for any institution and hence, let interested people proceed keeping the proverb "hasten slowly" in mind.  
Reg. the suggestion of Sri Varkhedi's writing "*To avoid unncessary noice, we must develop a small team of editors, which monitors the develpoment and approves them"*, you may be aware that Wiki itself has got a in-built democratic system for taking care of editorial management.  
Since I am not interested in personalized discussions(i.e. writing personal letters in groups), and the etiquette of group discussions does not agree it unlike in 'bvparishat-groups', please do not address any mail to me here after in this public forum. You may kindly do it to - [krishna...@hotmail.com]()  
**Reg. making use of Wikipedia or any other sister projects for the development of Samskrit, I hereby withdraw my earlier email-appeal.**  

## Wikipedia's sister projects

Wikipedia is hosted by the [Wikimedia Foundation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Foundation "Wikimedia Foundation"), a non-profit organization that also hosts a range of other [projects](http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Our_projects "wikimedia:Our projects"):
