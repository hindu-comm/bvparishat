Dear Sri Cha Mu Krishna Shastry Ji,  
  
I fully agree with you that the Sanskrit Language on Wiki must be free of errrorrrsss...  
At the same time, we should understand the freedom of writing on wiki - it is an open source book with out anybody's personal control developed by public. It generates interest among readers to see their writings published on web and shoots up the rating by partcipation. We must encourage this. To avoid unncessary noice, we must develop a small team of editors, which monitors the develpoment and approves them. But, please dont wait for Sanskrit veristies for this. Since, this is a public domain work., official pertcipation of versities or any agency makes this a mess. Individually anybody can join this work.  
  
As far as the present wikisource project is concern, it is altogether a different project that aims to collect Sanskrit old documents for public domain. It doen not require new content generation.  
  
Many efforts - Ranshtriya Sanskrit Sansthan, RS. Vidyapeetha and many other agencies on web - have already started but in controlled manner. This will be an open source without any copyright issue.  
  
Let us join hands without any delay.  
  
warm regards,  
shrivara
