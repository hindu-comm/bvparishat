 No need to spend too much time refuting 'historians' (or distortians?) like Thapar. But here are basic facts.



 1. Her advocacy of the Aryan invasion/migration has been demolished by science.



2. Her claim of 'no temple desruction at Ayodhya' has also collapsed and rejected by the courts.



 In any other profession, such colossal blunders would have finished her off, but she still has the shamelessness to show her face in public and continue writing reiterating her discredited position.



This is facesaving, not scholarship.
