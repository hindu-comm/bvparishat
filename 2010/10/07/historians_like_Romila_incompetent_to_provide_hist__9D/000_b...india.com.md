***Respected scholars,***

***I fully agree with the views of Shree Kalyanaraman. However I do not like that he (or any other natioanlist scholar) spends so much of his valuable time and energy in acknowledging (and refuting) the efforts of the pseudo secularists.***

***That time and effort could be better spent in the the objective analysis of the voluminous data he has collected. He is already on that all important job and keeps on enlightening us more and more.***

***I feel the views of the pseudo secularists should be referred to only if any member of this group wants any clarification on that.***

***With regards for all the readers,***

***Yours truly,***

***D.D.Misra***
