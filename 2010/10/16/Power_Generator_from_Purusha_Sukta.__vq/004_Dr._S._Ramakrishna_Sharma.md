QUOTE FROM <http://www.agragami.in/index-8.html>  
His prototype of a static alternator built exactly as per instructions of the first Sloka of the Purusha Sookta gave further inspiration for further scientific research into the links between the Vedic and modern science. What is most fascinating, is that the principles of physics exhibited in Vedic alternator are the same as those of particle accelerators, electron storage rings, pulse lasers and other most advanced achievements of modern physics that concentrate and focus the magnetic field.  
  
The Vedic static alternator has been patented as an offering at the lotus feet of Mother India.  
  
The next version was patented with Canadian research partners, when researchers noticed the similarities between the above mentioned principles, and pursued the concept further. The production based on both patents will start within one year in parallel in Bangalore, and in Niagara Regions in Canada and USA.   
  
The significance of these three locations is that of evolution and connectivity. Niagara Falls in Canada and US were the twin cities on both sides of the Niagara river where the generation of electricity started on a massive scale at the beginning of the 20th century, thanks to **[Nicola Tesla,](http://www.agragami.in/www.en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Tesla.com)** the Serbian immigrant, who came to America and contributed his great genius for the betterment of the mankind. Our objective is to build on the foundations of ancient Vedas and on the Tesla's work by applying the genius of our contemporaries to unlock the secrets encoded in Vedas and to make the connections with the latest achievements in science.
