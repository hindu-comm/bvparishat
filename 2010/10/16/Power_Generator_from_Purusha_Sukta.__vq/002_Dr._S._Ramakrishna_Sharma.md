Dear Sri Shrisha Rao,

  
\>Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.  

Extraordinary evidence will proclaim itself, if there be really any.  
The whole text is with me. I need to scan it and create a PDF  
to upload it to SCRIBD or WikiEducator.  
  
[www.agragami.in](http://www.agragami.in) seems to be a genuine website of Sri Satishchandra.  
Kindly go through the pages therein.  
  
Along with Mr.Paramahamsa Tiwari another person Mr.G.Srinivasan  
also was in the lime light who independently devised the "Vortex"  
stuff. He was then employed in Gulf. 20,000 Yen were "awarded"  
for the invention and initiative, then(as reported). Times of India four  
column news cutting was with me for long time.  
  
I am aware that verification and /or falsification takes no time  
and Truth will shine forth. I have spoken to Sri Satishchandra  
regarding his claim and he mentioned that the proto-type is  
successful. Gujarat govt has offered 50 acres of land to develop  
his project there.  
  
Let us wait and watch. Hope, that it is not hope against hoping!
