\> Mr. Sathish Chandra has deciphered the ‘purusha-sooktha’ (which are part of Vedas) using the Adibhouthika method. It is very difficult to interpret in that method and he has done it by doing very deep meditation. Let me take an example and explain how it works. (Please not that I am not getting into word by word interpretation).

I remember having seen this before. It would be great if Mr. Satish Chandra (or the fellow who wrote the blog quoted) would in fact present the new interpretation of the Puruṣa-Sūkta, in proper detail, to the community of Sanskrit scholars. We all know great Vaidika and other scholars who do not claim to have done anything quite so significant as "deciphering" the P-S by "deep meditation," and it would be a travesty for such a great accomplishment to go unrecognized.

There is a gentleman called Paramahamsa Tewari who made a claim in the 1980s to have discovered an alternative theory of physics that allowed him to build a perpetual-motion machine (with an efficiency of 250% or something like that). He claimed to have conducted demos before foreign scientists, and his work was given wide publicity in the media and even discussed in parliament (where the government of the day, under the premiership of the late Rajiv Gandhi, promised all support to him). Lately, of course, Tewari and his contraption are not much in the news (though he seems to still maintain a website where one can peruse his claims), in large part because people noted that his claimed results aren't reproducible. (A senior VP at Kirloskar Electric, who was an initial convert to Tewari's theory, later helped debunk the same when he found -- after spending over a lakh of rupees in those days -- that the apparatus did not work as claimed.) The only result of this whole episode was possibly to give science and technology in India a bad name (there are IIT professors and others who to this day express anguish and anger at the Tewari episode for this reason).

Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.
