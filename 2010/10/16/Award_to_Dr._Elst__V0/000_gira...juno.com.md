Respected Scholars, Namaskar!

  
I support the idea of giving a big award to Dr. Koenraad Elst for supporting the cause of Rama jamnabhoomi.  
His other contributions are praise worthy in connection with Aryan theory and Linguistics. His postings on other websites were full of details and offered new information.

Second I wish all of you happy Vijaya Dashami and happy Deepavali season. Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
