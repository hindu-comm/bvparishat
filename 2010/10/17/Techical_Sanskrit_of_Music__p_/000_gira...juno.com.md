Respected Scholars, Namaskar!

There was discussion on the list about the word " MUrcanA, MUrchanA and MurcchanA".

I looked into the dictionary of Apte.It says MUrcchanA= a duly regulated rise and fall of sounds, conducting the air and harmony through the keys in a pleasing manner, modulation, melody.

We need a Music scholar on this list who knows Sanskrit and English terminology to explain certain nice specialties of Indian classical music. I came across once a book on Music Terminology from Saama-veda written in English. I repent I did not note down its name. Words from Technical Sanskrit fit well to my VarNavAda theory (Phonemic symbolism in semantics of Sanskrit). Thanks. N.R.Joshi
