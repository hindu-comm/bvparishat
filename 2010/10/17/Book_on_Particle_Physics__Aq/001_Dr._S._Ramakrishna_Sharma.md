Dr.Khem Chand Sharma spoke to me and informed that  
he will be sending a copy of the book(on payment of Rs.1500/=)  
to Dr.M.N Venkatesh who is one of the coordinators of the upcoming  
Conference on Decoding Veda Vidya. He wanted it to be reviewed also.  
He will be presenting a Paper on the topic related to the content of the book  
during the Conference. We have received the abstract.  
  
After the Press Meet which is yet to be scheduled in November, the list  
of select abstracts will be posted here.  
  
\>He used Kaamadhenu Tantra.  
  
Needs more details as to how the contents are related.  
  
Thanks for the information.
