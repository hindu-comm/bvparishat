**3628.** **PW-24 Prof. D Mandal** retired from the Departmentof Ancient History and Archaeology, Allahabad University, whowas appointed on adhoc basis as Lecturer in 1972 but priorthereto he claimed to have worked as exploration assistant since1960. Initially he appeared as an expert to depose that there isno archaeological evidence to show either existence of anytemple at the disputed site or that a temple was demolishedbefore construction of the disputed structure. The statementsmade by him in cross examination shows the shallowness of hisknowledge in the subject:

  

*“I never visited Ayodhya” (E.T.C.)*

  

*“I do not have any specific knowledge of history of*Babur's reign.” (E.T.C.)**

  

*“ Whatsoever little knowledge I have about Babur is*only that Babur was the ruler of the 16**th* *century. Except for*this, I do not have any knowledge of Babur.***

  

I also do not knowwhether or not it is correctly written on page 10 of theafore-said preface that Ayodhya is a site of pilgrimage for

*adherents of Ramanand school.” (E.T.C.)*

  

*“The Communist Party issues a red card, and I amits holder.*

  

*“I do not know whether Sri S. Gopal is ofCommunistic thought or not. But Prof. Romila Thapar is*influenced by Marxism.” (E.T.C.)**

  

***"I never even visited Ayodhya****.” (E.T.C.)*

  

*“It is true that* ***I have not seen the disputed building***as yet****. I did not make any physical investigation of stoneused in inscriptions carved out in the disputed building.Likewise, I also did not make physical investigation ofbasalt stone.” (E.T.C.)****

  

*“It is true that ****I am of
communistic***thought****.”(E.T.C.)****
