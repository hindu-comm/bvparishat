Respected Scholars, Namaste!

I congratulate Dr,Yadu Moharir on his coming books on Vinayaka.

Not only he has knowledge of Vedic literature, but he knows a lot about the Ayurvedic traditions of ancient and modern India. His style is different. He tells me directly the main chemical ingredient in Ayurvedic drugs and its use for a certain disease. He had some reservations about Ayurvedic drugs sold by some Himalayan Babas in India and in the world. I realized from him that knowledge of Sanskrit and of modern chemistry both are needed in order to understand ancient Ayurvedic drugs. His stress is always on application of knowledge (Viniyoga). I like applications. He also thinks that any science (either Ayurveda or physics) has to grow and invent new applications that can be proved experimentally. In short there is always room for new design. Elecric shaver of Noralco sells for $50 in USA. Chines made one can buy for $5 . Chines made new design and it works. I imagine in his new book he may stress Viniyoga side of Vinayaka or Ganesh Pooja. Civilizations which boasted that they reached the peak of perfection start on the road of downfall. My first sentence on the class "There is always room for new design, new invention". Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
