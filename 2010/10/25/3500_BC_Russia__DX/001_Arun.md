Even after breaking of USSR, Russia is still no.2 power. There were  
much earlier studies of Indian texts in Russia. There was much  
suppression in time of Stalin, but he was not as oppressive as British  
rule which killed about 10 million as retaliation of 1857 revolt only  
and exiled 30 lakhs to Maurisus, Trinidad, Fizi and Guyana.  
No Oxford author has ever indicated any Indian source about any  
material stolen from India and read with help of Indians to start  
with. Rather Boden Chair of 1831 and all its authors have openly  
declared their aim to destroy Vedic culture which is still pursued by  
their followers in name of 'free research'. In Russia, even in time of  
Stalin, Mahabharata and Ramayana were translated by Pyotr Varannikov  
etc. Most of authors of mathematics texts like A.G. Kurosh,  
Ambarsaumyan (astronomer) have given impartial analysis of Indian math  
unlike Greeko-Roman interpratation of Oxford. About Russian vedic  
culture, Pt. Madhusudan Ojha in 1910 had written about ancient  
research center there and has give its latitude and subject of study.  
Obviously, the culture was formed in large area around this site.
