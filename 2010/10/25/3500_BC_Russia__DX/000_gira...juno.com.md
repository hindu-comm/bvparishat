Respected Scholars, Namaskar!  
  
VEDAS & HUMAN DNA VI - ARKAIM: THE CRADLE OF ARYAN CIVILIZATION  
  
Thanks to Dr. Kalyanraman for posting UTube references of archaeological site at Akraim in Russia. It shows Aryan presence in Russian land in 3500 BC. How to explain this? Russia lost its empire. Russians need something to uplift their spirit. So fever of Aryanism is increasing in Russia.  
  
I said earlier new information keeps coming every year. In Bulgaria they found the whole chariot intact. All archaeological sites are in danger always because of thieves who would like to steal the artifacts and sell it in black market. This is happening in Afghanistan. Iraq's museums were looted by Iraqis as well as by foreigners during war in that country.  
  
It was great pleasure for me to see the exhibition in the Museum of Fine Arts (Houston-2008) of artifacts excavated in the northern Afghanistan( land of ancient Bactria-Jewel of Persian Empire of the known history). Right now mummies from Ladies kingdom on display in Natural History Museum in Houston. Thanks. N.
