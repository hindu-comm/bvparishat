Respected Scholars, Namaskar!  
  
Vaade Vaade Jaayate Tattvabodhah !  
  
Dr. Sadashiva Murty Rani offered a long list of research methods in connection with the ancient history ofIndia (Dated Octo. 15). I am thankful to him for that. I would like to add that these methods are already used by scholars for the hundred years. New information arrives every year.So the research continues. For this reason free flow of information here should be allowed. Please write what you know. Please do not pass the remarks on others. If two views are opposite, let both be presented. Before Panini, scholars of the ancient India posed many questions about scriptures. This is healthy process of flowing information like flowing water (Prasanna Jalam) as opposed to stagnant water (Vis'NNa Jalam). Thanks. N.R.Joshi
