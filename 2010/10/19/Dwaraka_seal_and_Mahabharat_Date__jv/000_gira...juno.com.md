Respected Scholars, Namaste!

Astronomers differ widely

First-The mention of recovering seals (used in the ancient Mahabharat Dwaraka) from the bottom of sea by divers (used by S. R.Rao in exploration of underwater Dwaraka) appears in the article of Rakesh Krishnan Simha (I think posted on bvparishat by Dr. Kalyanraman on Oct 18-please pardon me if I were wrong). My question was in connection to that seal. PLease pardon me if I asked you the question about it. Any body who has information such seal or it photo printed somewhere, please let us know.

Second Rakesh Krishna Simha refers to dates -war took place in 3037 BC and Krishna's birth in 3112 BC. He gives reference to my friend's (Dr. Narahari Achar) research. Now look at the situation. In article of Sept27 Shree Arun Upadhyay says, " Sri Narahari Achara has applied Eclipse data-but there is no reference of 3 eclipses in Mahabharat war". Dr. Achar posted his research on Oct 11 here on bvparshat. In my opinion Dr. RN Iyengar may not agree with either of these dates (Dr. Iyengar-please correct me if I were wrong). In the posting of date Octo 9, Shri Arun Upadhyay talks about author K. Chandra Hari introducing error of 2000 years. (Shri Arun,please correct me-If I am quoting you wrongly-If I were wrong, please explain position of Chandra Hari about dates discussed here.). Dr.Vartak from Pune may have different dates.

I know from he ancient time India produced a large number of astronomers and treatises on astronomy. Then why astronomers differ so widely? I get puzzled which astronomer and which dates of Mahabharat war and Krishn's birth should I trust? Thanks. N.R.Joshi
