All the books mentioned by you are based on secondary sources and lack  
references of the textual sources. If you really interested in knowing  
about Indian tradition or civilization then go through the "History of  
DharmaShAstra, P.V.Kane". It is voluminous work which through the  
almost real picture of our culture and civilization without any  
prejudice.I request you please be stand either side right or left,  
externalist or internalist, otherwise your position will be like  
CArvAk.

If you have done any work or seen any worth my attention please inform. I shall go through it. I do not dislike persons associated to RSS. Most of my friends and helpmates are from SS.Kalyanraman and NS Rajaram are my friends.But when we look broadly they read and understand less and make bigger noise worse than theleftists. Conressite neither I am nor I can not be. We must know each other and talk as Hindus whose cherished values have been thrown to dogs, who assure much, bark a lot but underastand not what is there to save and what is not.BS
