Dear Bhagwan Singh  
Why you are making this kind of statement? What is your message to  
scholars and the present society. Are you secular? It seems that you  
are originating riotous situations after putting all these words.This  
forum is neither for RSS nor for Congress or for any other political  
parties rather it is only for scholarly discussions. If you really a  
scholar then why you do not discuss any topic related to the  
scriptures Vedic, Buddhist or Jainism? So please do not blame to any  
particular cast or ethnic group, all depends on individual not the  
general. Please refrain from this type of statement in this forum.  
  
I request to the concerned authority of this group that please look  
into this matter.  
Thanks

God save the nation from RSS. It has not made any dent in any strata of Hindu society except Brahmans and Baniyas. So exposed it is before Hindu masses. It is better only to the Indian secularism.
