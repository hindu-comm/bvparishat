Namo vidvadbhyah

The range of the term ‘bhedah ‘ in Vyakaranam and Philosophy ---

Niruktam , NyAyah, Vaisesikam , VyAkaranam , Yogah , MImAmsA , VedAntah , SAmkhyam -

will be taken for analysis --

Bhidir = vidAran.e (juhotyAdih) , bhidyate anena , karane ghan(ca) by ‘akartari ca kArake samjnayam’(Pan 3-3-19) . BhinattIti bhedakam , n.vul by ‘ n.vultrcau(Pan 3-1-133) . Bhettum yogyam bhedyam , yat by
‘arhe krtyatrcasca’ (Pan 3-3-169).

Bhedakam , visesanam , avacchedakam – on one side and bhedyam , visesyam , avacchinnam on the other, are synonyms .

**Vaisesikas and NaiyAyikas** argue that since the bheda , which is nitya, is there between a ghata and a pata , in the form – pate na ghatah , ghate na patah ,there is anyonyAbhAva

which is nothing but ‘bheda’ only . The same is ‘tAdAtmyAbhAvah or to put it more technically

anyonyAbhAvasca tAdAtmyasambandhAvacchinnAbhAvah .

Anyonyasmin tAdAtmyena abhAvah = anyonyAbhAvah .

Bhedasahisnuh abhedah tAdAtmyam . Sah AtmA yasya sah tadAtmA , tasya
bhAvah (s.yan, gunavacanabrAhman.Adibhyah karmani ca, Pan 5-1-124) tAdAtmyam .

Examples for TAdAtmyam – omityekAksaram brahma , vrddhirAdaic , amarA nirjarA devAh .

Prabhedah is nothing but ‘bhedah’ .

KuthAro bhinatti -- the word ‘kuthArah’ is NAma and it is the Visesanam of AkhyAtam -

**Niruktam** – namati AkhyAtArtham prati visesanIbhavatIti nAma .

There is an argument (ManjUsA) - sabdArthayoh tAdAtmyam , how ?
what is the Sabda ? guah , what is the Artha ? gauh . Further it can be asked – what is the jnAnam ? gauh -

**YogasUtram** -

**sabdArthapratyayAnam itaretarAdhyAsAt sankarah
tatpravibhAgasamyamAt sarvabhUtarutajnAnam (3-17) . Sabda eva Arthah , Artha eva Sabdah , Sabda eva JnAnam –**

**is ‘ itaretarAdhyAsa’ .**

So , although there is no ‘bheda’ between sabda and artha , for VyavahAra , you are creating ‘bheda’ ( for details in this regard please visit my forthcoming posting ‘Sabdah’) .

Visistabuddhau visesanajnAnasya kAranatvam - therefore there can be bheda (distinction)between Visesanam and Visesyam . A thing with a Visesanam is ‘ Visistam’.

NIlatvavisesanavisistam utpalam .

Visesanam is useful in generating ‘bheda’ between the Visesyam , it is connected with, and the rest -- nIlam utpalam , here ‘nIlam’ separates ‘utpalam’ (thru Guna) from others .

Following the above norm only it is also called - bhedakam and
avacchedakam .

Gotvam is avacchedakam - gotvAvcchinnA or gotvAvacchedakAvacchinnA gauh .

The term ‘bhedakah’ was used by Hari in VAkyapadIyam in the sense
of Visesanam (2-204)-

kriyAyA dyotako nAyam sambandhasya na vAcakah I

nApi kriyApadAksepI sambandhakasya tu bhedakah II (KarmapravacanIyah)

‘Bhedyam’ – is also used by Hari in the sense of ‘Visesyam’ ( 3-4-3) – the definition of ‘Dravyam’ (Bhuyodravyasamuddesah) –

vastUpalaksanam yatra sarvanAma prayujyate I

dravyamityucyate so’rtho bhedyatvena vivaksitah II

Generally it is explained that ‘Vyakti’ or ‘Dravyam’ is Visesyam and ‘ JAti, Guna, KriyA etc. are

Visesanas . But the real factor that decides is ‘VivaksA’ , i.e. JAti etc. can also become Visesyam.

JAti is denoted thru ‘tva’ or ‘tal’ (Pan – tasya bhAvastvatalau , 5-1-119) and ‘gotvam’ etc.

can be taken as Visesyam . On the other hand , when there is no such a Pratyaya then

JAti has to be shown along with ‘Vyakti’ thru ‘abheda’ .

In the case of ‘Guna’, bheda can also be exhibited - patasya
suklah --

na gotvam sAbaleyasya gauriti vyapadisyate I

suklatvam bAhuleyasya sukla ityapadisyate II (VAkya 3- Vrtti – 147)



In SiddhAnta there is neither KAla nor Dik (nor Desa) and the VyavahAra is due to artificial creation – ksana , nimesa etc.

**Patanjali** under ‘vrddhirAdaic’ (Pan 1-1-1) discusses the aspect of – bhedakA gunAh / abhedakA gunAh ( ParibhAsendusekhara also) . Here ‘bhedakah’ means ‘vivaksitah’ .

It is the ‘**SamkhyA**’ which can generate ‘ bheda ‘ among all things (VAkya 3- Kala – 2) –

distiprasthasuvarnAdi mUrtibhedAya kalpate I

kriyAbhedAya kAlastu samkhyA sarvasya bhedika II

SamkhyA can measure - mUrta , amUrta, pramAna and samkhyA .

The concept of ‘bheda ‘ and ‘ abheda’ is dependent on ‘SamkhyA’ (VP 3-SamkhyA – 1)—

samkhyAvAn sattvabhUto’rthah sarva evAbhidhIyate I

bhedAbhedavibhAgo hi loke samkhyAnibandhanah II

**RAhoh sirah , silAputrakasya sarIram** - in such cases there is ‘ kAlpanikAvayavAvayavibhAvah’

and this is explained under ‘ Adyantavadekasmain’(Pan 1-1-21) by Patanjali , i.e. a single phoneme is considered as ‘Adi’ and ‘anta’ , due to ‘kalpanA’ .

**AbrAhmanah** - here ‘nan’ denotes ‘ **bheda’ and ‘sAdrsyam**’ , i.e. brahanabhinnah brAhmanasadrsah sca , ksatriyAdih na tu lostah . Here ‘bheda’ cannot be taken separately .

‘Samarthah padavidhih ‘ (Pan 2-1-1) – here ‘sAmarthyam’ is **bheda and** **samsarga** , combinely .

RAjnah purusah – rAjapurusah .

For SAmkhyas and VedAntins (vyavahAre bhAttanayah )also ‘bheda’ is required – the sentence - sarIrasya AtmA – is an authority in establishing the SiddhAnta – ‘asti AtmA’.

MimAmsakas accept ‘ abhAva’ but not VaiyAkaranas (abhAvasya abhAvah etc avyavasthA).
