Respected Scholars,

Jayatu Bharatam Jayatu Samskritam

What will be real meaning of the term" भेदः". In Sanskrit as we find  
various meanings of this term, such as - अन्योन्याभावः, प्रभेदः,  
तादात्म्यातिरिक्तः सम्बन्धः.(न्याय०). We also find the statement that  
भेद्यं विशेष्यमित्याहुर्भेदकं च विशेषणम् इति, भेदकारकम् - यथा कुठारो  
भिनत्तीत्यादॊ कुठारो भेदकः। ।n this case what is real interpretation  
of the aforesaid term? I think there is no any uniformity between  
Grammarian and Philosophers. The main issue lies in this - ‘when  
distinction occurs? Whether the distinction is between attribute  
(viSeShaNa) and attributive(viSeshya), or attribute and  
substantive(viShiSTa). Really I am getting confused, please help me.
