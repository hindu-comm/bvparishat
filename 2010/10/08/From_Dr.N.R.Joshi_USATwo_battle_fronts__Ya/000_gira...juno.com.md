Respected Scholars, Namaste!

Two battle fronts-Mahabharat history and Semantics of Sanskrit

First -Mahabharat- Thanks Dr, Kalyanraman for posting "How Mahabharat is studied---"

Homeric epics were composed long after (800 BC) the Trojan war (1350-80 BC). If some scholars would like to do  
comparison between Homeric epics and heroes and heroes Mahabharata, let them do it. For us Mahabharat history is important for many reasons. During my presentation in BORI archaeological scholars from Deccan College were present. The epic war was battlefront for Pandavas. Now it is battlefront for all world scholars-History or Myth? I hope Indian archeology brings forth new evidence in support of Mahabharat history. Until now we have to rely on both internal and external sources. That what I did.

Excavations from Troja (Hittite empire-in ancient land of Turkey) are important because it produced documented written on tablet evidence of Indra,Varun, Nasatya in treaty. To the best of my knowledge no such documented evidence came until now from the subcontinent (if yes, please let us know) although the subcontinent Brahmins preserved Vedas orally for thousands of years. A handbook of chariot races was found. Other importance of Trojan war for India-there were Palasgians and lady soldiers helping Hittites against Achians, Dannans (Greek is general cover name). Who were Palasgians? All wars are economic wars-so was the Trojan war to control trade of India with Europe. Was Mahabharat war economic war? I do not know.

I read Shree Arun Upadhyaya-posting from Jewish encyclopedia. Information is correct in that Medes were Aryans. So Persians east of them were Aryans. All ancient tribes from Afghanistan were Aryans. Now we find evidence of Aryans all over Eurasia even at 4000 BC, in some cases 5000 BC. Now there is puzzle-what is relationship of these Aryans with Mahabharat history? There are two theories-AIT and OIT.Puzzle and battlefront is not over.

Second battlefront-Who does not have interest in it? It remained the battle field par excellence for exegetes, logicians  
and grammarians with various backgrounds and philosophical commitments. On this battle field intellectual ability of ancient and modern Indian scholars stand out in a special way. The whole world is studying it. And this battle is not over yet either. Thanks. N.R.Joshi
