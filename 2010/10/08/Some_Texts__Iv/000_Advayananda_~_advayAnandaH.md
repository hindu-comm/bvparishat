Respected scholars,  
  
I need information on the availability of the following texts, either in digital (pdf or scanned) or book (hard copy) format. Will be grateful if someone can guide me as to where these books are available:  
  
1. The Samskrita Tika of Pandit Kashinathji on Anubhutiprakasha  
2. The complete Dharmakuta commentary on Valmiki Ramayana by Trayambakaraya Makhi  
  
With regards,  
Advayananda
