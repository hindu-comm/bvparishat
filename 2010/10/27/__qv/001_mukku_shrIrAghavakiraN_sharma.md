What I learned about aSvadhATI is that, it is a vrtta with the ganas ta (110) bha (100) ya (011) ja (010) sa (001) ra (101) na (000) guru (1) in that order. The ganas can better be seen as a triplet of ta-bha-laghu (1101000) followed by a guru, for understanding of the yati viraama easily.

  

Kalidasa's beautiful composition on Holy Mother set to this vrttam is very special.
