Sir, Just when I was searching explanation for many Saraswatis, your  
explanation came. On a description by Maharshi Daivarata, I searched  
the following verse from Yajurveda (34/11)  
पञ्च नद्यः सरस्वतीमपियन्ति सस्रोतसः । सरस्वती तु पञ्चधा सो देशे  
अभवत्सरित् ।  
Despite your explanation, I am not very clear about its meaning. I  
think that Divya Sarasvati refers to the river called Akashaganga-that  
is in Sarasvan Samudra. In Gayatri, we follwo this order-  
Gayatri= Earth  
Savitri = Solar system  
Sarasvati =galaxy  
Each is 2 power 24 (= 1 crore) times the previous starting with man.  
24 is number of Gayatri Chhanda. Among physical rives we always forget  
east part. We interpret Iravati as Ravi, but forget real Iravati in  
Burma (Myammar). Elephant beyond (east of that) this region was called  
Airavata. That was white elephant of Indra. Even now elephants of this  
region are called white-actually they are light brown. Island of Indra  
is Sumatra as Indra himself was Sutrama (Varna-viparyaya). Coming to  
rivers, there is a Yamuna meeting Ganga at Prayaga. There is another  
in Bangladesh meetin Brahmaputra.  
In general 3 sets of 7 rivers have been stated in Rigveda (10/64/8,  
10/75/4-6) etc which have been explained by Madhusudan Ojha in Indra-  
vijaya in detail. About 7 sarasvatis described by you, the last  
reference is by Guru Nanaka. He had come to Prithudaka where king  
Prithu himself had offered Udaka to his pitars. On request of Guru  
Nanaka, Sarasvati water came from underground current. There is a  
Gurudvara called 'Pehova' near it-Arun
