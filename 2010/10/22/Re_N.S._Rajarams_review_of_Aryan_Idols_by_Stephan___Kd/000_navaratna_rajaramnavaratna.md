Namaste Makkhan Lalji:



 Here is a review of an important book. I have ordered a copy. We may look at it from an Indian perspective as part of our projected book.



 Please see the last paragraph. That is a question we need to address in our book.



Best regards,

rather interesting take on the aryan fantasy.

Here is the original (unedited) text of the feature review that  
appeared in the Novemeber 5, 2006issue of The Week.  
  
An interesting development is the matter fact recognition of the Aryan  
myth as a European racist/political/cultural phenomenon that has no  
basis in fact. The focus now is an finding explanations for this  
pathological brand of 'scholarship.'



 **This means that we too should  
shift our attention from refutation to diagnosing this phenomenon, and  
its persistence in academica and politics under various guises.**

A EUROPEAN LOOK AT THE ARYAN MYTH  
  
  
  
*Aryan Idols: Indo-European Mythology as Ideology and Science* by Stefan  
Arvidsson (2006), translated by Sonia Wichmann, The University of Chicago  
Press.  
  
Judged strictly on merit, the various Aryan theories rank  
among the weakest examples of scholarship, riddled with  
scientific contradictions and weighed down by political and  
racial prejudices. But in influence and longevity, especially  
in politics, they bid fair to compare with the theories of  
Einstein and Darwin. The 'Aryan nation' became the mantra of  
German unification, while in colonial India, Aryans became the  
common ancestors of the Indians and the British, the latter  
benevolently ruling over their degraded brothers. Neither  
Relativity nor the Theory of Evolution can match this.

  
While the scientific, racial and political aspects of Aryan  
theories have been debated threadbare, a basic question has  
gone begging: what drove the Europeans, Germans in particular  
to go to a land and a people so far removed from them in space  
and time to define themselves? This question is effectively  
answered by the Swedish scholar Stefan Arvidsson in his  
remarkable book *Aryan Idols.* In the process, he has also shed  
valuable light on the European cultural currents leading to  
the persistence of these theories in Western academia as well  
as their proneness to ideological abuse.  
  
A useful point that Arvidsson makes is that the goal of this  
discipline, now called Indo-European studies was not so much  
to understand Indian origins as to "show that there existed a  
rich 'German' mythology that could successfully compete with  
classical Judeo-Christian traditions." It is hardly surprising  
that anti-Semitism was tied up with it.  
  
A little known aspect of Aryan theories, at least in India, is the major  
contribution of German folklore. Wilhem and Jacob Grimm, who compiled  
German folk tales were also philologists. "For over two hundred years, a  
series of historians, linguists, folklorists, and archaeologists have  
tried to re-create a lost culture.Using ancient texts, medieval records,  
philological observations, and archaeological remains they have described  
a world, a religion, and a people older than the Sumerians, with whom all  
history is said to have begun."  
  
  
There are of course no Indo-European texts. "No objects can definitely be  
tied to them, nor do we know any 'Indo-European' by name.In spite of  
that, scholars have stubbornly tried to reach back to the ancient  
'Indo-Europeans,' with the help of bold historical, linguistic, and  
archaeological reconstructions, in the hopes of finding the foundation of  
their own culture and religion there."  
  
This helps answer the question why some Western academics  
react viscerally whenever their theories are thrown in doubt  
by new findings in archaeology, natural history or genetics.  
They strike at the very root their cherished ideas about their  
identity. As Arvidsson notes: "There is something in the  
nature of research about Indo-Europeans that makes it  
especially prone to ideological abuse- perhaps something  
related to the fact that for the past two centuries, the  
majority of scholars who have done research on the  
Indo-Europeans have considered themselves descendants of this  
mythical race." This 'ideological abuse' reached its  
culmination in Nazi regime. More recently, it raised its head  
when California education authorities tried to change the  
syllabus in elementary schools, replacing theories like the  
Aryan invasion with more recent findings.  
  
Speaking of Indology, the book observes: "The theory about  
India as the original home of the Indo-Europeans, and the  
Indians as a kind of model Aryans, lost supporters during the  
nineteenth century, and other homelands and other model Aryans  
took their place instead." The Aryans (or Indo-Europeans) and  
their homeland were gradually moved westward until they were  
made to settle in Eurasia and even Germany. In the hands of  
German scholars, Aryans became "Indo-Germanische."  
  
In summary, "The main reason why scholarship about the  
Indo-Europeans has tended to produce myths is that so many who  
have written (and read) about it have interpreted it as  
concerning THEIR OWN ORIGIN."While this accounts for the  
European attachment to the Aryan myth, it fails to explain why  
many Indian scholars continue to cling to it. The answer will  
have to come from an Indian scholar.
