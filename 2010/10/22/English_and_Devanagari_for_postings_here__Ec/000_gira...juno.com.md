Respected Scholars, Namaskar!

Dr . Korada offers great details (see Bhedam-posting). And the postings in English with Harvard Kyoto scheme. It  
slows me down to figure out Sanskrit words. India and bvparishat have great computer brains (software etc). Is this possible to use some gimmick so that we see SAnskrit words in Devanagari along with English spelling. Find some solution please. Thanks. N.R.Joshi
