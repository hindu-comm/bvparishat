Dear All,  
 I just read with immense interest Mr.S.Kannan's two postings: one on"secular verbiage", the other on "exposed experts" \[contra S. Kalyanaraman's\]. Mr.Kannan has added a long tirade of one T.K.Arun. Arun's advice \[supposedly supported by Kannan\] is: i)Whydon't they \[the Hindus\]just accept the judgement & work for a compromise?--Whoshouldthis advice br reallymeant for? So far as I know, it is the Sunni Waqf board that is thinking of keeping the issue on the'hot burner' by planning to go theSC. Have they or any Indian Muslim body/individual advised the IndianMuslim communityto accept the verdict with a view to arriving at a compromise? I would like to be informed of it. ii) The HC verdict on Ayodhya(by upholding the notin of 'God' as a legal person has made agrave injustice) & such a legal provision must be repealed, sooner, ratherthan later, because of it's a vestige of our colonial past. Wonderful, except that Mr.Kannan himself needs torefer us to one'Mark Tully's remark, to provethat Indian secularism (as guaranteed by the Indian Constitution) is a negative one. Let us suppose thatIndia failed in practice to uphold 'true/positive' secularism. I wonder, which of the two options viz., trying to uphold secularismm as an idealvalue but to fail in practiceor, jettisioning 'secularism'as a value altogether \[as is done by most of the Islamic countries\] Mr. Kannan &Co would consider preferable. Sure,it is better to try and fail, than not to try at all. Most of our 'supra secular' friends must have heard of the destruction of the Bamiyan Buddha statues& also of the court case filed in Malayasia by a Muslim body, against a Chrstian church for an act of 'blashphemy' viz.,translating 'Allah' by 'God'. All these, I presume, were done by the Muslim group, in a 'true spirit' of secularism! As their names suggest, both Mr.Kannan & Mr. Arun are non-muslims, so are some of theIndian historians. They are bold enough to find fault with the intolerant/non-secular attitude of the Hindus. I respect their right tofreely express their opinions, butI wonder if they canname even one IndianMuslim historian whodared to beopenly criticalof Islamic intolerance. I bet they can't find such a historian, and if they can't, they must pause to ask themselves"Why so". My aim here is not to justify the view that 'two wrongs can makeit right'--obviously, it cannot. But, at the same time, one must not forget that'respect', 'conciliation', 'religious tolerance' etc.need a two-way traffic--one-way traffic won't work.It is often fashionable to cry hoarse for 'minority rights' but that must not make us blind of avery real prospect ofsuccumbig toa kind of 'tyranny of the minority' as an antidote. People in a glass tower mustthink twice before theythrow stones at others.  
Sarkar.
