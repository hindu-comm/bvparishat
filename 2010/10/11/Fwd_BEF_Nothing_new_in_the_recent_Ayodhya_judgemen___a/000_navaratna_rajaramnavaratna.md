*October 11, 2010*  

 This is what I have been pointing out in my talks and inteviews here in U.K. In the past two weeks I have given 12 talks and interviews, about half of them on Ayodhya, though the topic came up during the open session in other talks also. The most extraordinary was during the one on Quantum Physics and Vedanta given before the Metaphysical Society in Manchester.



 There was great excitemnt as just two days before my program two University of Manchester scientists had won the Nobel Prize in physics, but still people were interested in Ayodhya!



 It is important now to emphasize that the people who kept the 'controversy' alive were the pseudo-hstorians (**distortians**) giving false assurances to Muslim leaders who are now made to look like fools for the previlege of paying them.



 All the data needed to reach the decision now given by the court existed 30 years ago. Had that happened at that time, many lives would have been saved and the ensuing ill will avoided. So these 'secularists' have blood on their hands.



 The lesson to be learnt is that the contending parties should sit down and settle issues along themselves and keep these self-serving Shakunis and Mantharas at a safe distance.



 Now it is a massive face saving exercise for Romila Thapar & Co, and she has already begun her campaign attacking the court decision. Please see her for what she is-- a failed scholar and a self serving political hack. Keep her out and focus on an amicable settlement. People don't exist to serve as canon fodder to serve her bruised ego

In 1992, Narsimha Rao formed what was called Ayodhya Cell, under Naresh  
Chandra, who later became the Indian Ambassador to the United States.  
This cell had come to the same conclusion, based on the same set of  
documents, as the high court has recently done. In an article in The  
Sunday (now defunct) dated October 10, 1992, it reported:  
QUOTE  
"The Muslim case is one of self-created weaknesses," said a member of  
the Ayodhya cell. "First there is no documentation of their claim:  
second the mutwalli (mosque priest) has left the place at the mercy of  
the keertanwallas and has never been keen to reclaim it: third it is the  
Hindus who are now in possession."  
UNQUOTE  
  
The cell also found enough evidence to establish that there was a temple  
under the Babri structure. This was even before it had the benefit of  
the ground penetration radar study and the subsequent archaeological  
investigation, both done at the instance of the high court.  
  
On the issue of the various people supposed to be experts, the above  
report said:  
QUOTE  
For instance, members of the cell are strongly critical of the attempts  
by a team of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) professors to prove  
historically that Ram was not born in Ayodhya. "Progressive historians  
(like Romila Thapar, S. Gopal and others) are more keen to present their  
modern, secular credentials," said an official in disgust. "They want to  
sound superior and informed, but we find their writings opinionated and  
argumentative."  
UNQUOTE  
  
In the recent judgement,, a report in the Times of India (October 9,  
2010) reported:  
QUOTE  
Justice Agarwal referred to signed statements issued by experts and  
noted that "instead of helping in making a cordial atmosphere it tends  
to create more complications, conflict and controversy. One cannot say  
that though I had made a statement but I am not responsible for its  
authenticity since it is not based on my study or research but what I  
have learnt from what others have uttered," Justice Aggarwal has said,  
emphasising the need for thorough original research before concurring  
with what someone else has claimed  
UNQUOTE  
  
It is necessary to make these 'experts' accountable for what they said.  
Most of them are employed in state institutes, funded by the tax payers.  
They have to be honest not just to their profession but also to the  
society that is supporting them and enabling them to have a life style,  
not available to most of the people of the countyr. They also get  
invited to conferences all over the world, to give their opinion on  
issues relating to India's history.  
  
The destructive role of the experts is, sadly, rarely mentioned by the  
mainstream media. In effect, they have become colloaborators with  
theise experts in vitiating the atmosphere in India.
