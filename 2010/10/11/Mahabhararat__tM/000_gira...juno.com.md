Respected Scholars,Namaskar!

Who were Medes?

I obtained the book of Savitra Saxena recommended by Prof. Narang. I am checking my information with that given in the book.

To Shree Arun Upadhyaya.

You were saying "Medes east of Indus". Jewish encyclopedia does not say so. It says Aryan Medes. I say so were Persians and all tribes from Afghanistan and greater part of Eurasia. Medes were not east of Indus and they did not destroy Assyrians going from India to Assyria. Medes just east of Assyria and in the western Iran destroyed Assyrians. My aim is to collect information. Now whether these Aryans from Middle East came from east of Indus river is debated by proponents of different theories of the history of Ancient India. Please offer your information. Others will ask questions. Please answer if you would like to. Why to pass remarks on others?

If you are so eager to pass remarks on others, please pass them to Karunanidhi from India who gave award to Dr. Asko Purpola the proponent of Aryan Dravidian Linguistics with connection to Indus seals inviting him to the big conference this year in Tamilnadu.

  
If anybody sincerely believes that Medes migrated to the west from east of Indus, I would like to know their earlier name in the ancient subcontinent. Let us share information and grow in common understanding. N.R.Joshi.
