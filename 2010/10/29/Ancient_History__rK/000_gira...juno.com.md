Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



I am referring to Dr. Sadashiva Murthy Rani's posting,

Dear Dr. Sadashiva Murthy Rani, PraNAm!



I agree you never passed remark on anybody. Your postings offer information. I read them and I learn from them. Doctor Rani says, ""My straight question is this how a Max Muller or a Weber can be better than the Rgveda or Yajurveda in knowing about them? Why the writers of our Indian History mostly depend on such foreign and tertiary sources? "



My response: I do not agree with Max Muller or Weber in connection with Indian chronology. I am not writing the book on Indian history, so no question of me using Max Muller. Max Muller intentions were exposed by his own wife. Dr. Rajaram, Dr. Kalyanraman and many other scholars from Indiaknow it.

I am interested in only Mahabharat history-the relationship of the Indian subcontinent (Pakistan +truncated India+Bangla Desh)with Asian continent from 3000 BC to 326 BC (Alexander).For this reason I read the books of Dr. Roy Chowdhary, Dr. Savitri Saxsena, Dr. Bhagwan Singh, another Dr Singh, Dr. Rajaram, Shri Talgeri, Dr. Koenraad Elst, Dr. Richard Fry (Harward University), Dr. James Russell, Lithuanian archaeologist Marija Gimbutas, Dr. Asko Purpola, German archaeologist Dr. Ernst Herzfeld and of many other authors. I used 3000 BC because some scholars are proposing the date of the war described in the epic Mahabharat. I am not expert on deciding dates using Astronomical data. **And astronomers differ widely from each other. We experienced that on this list.**

****

**Doctor Rani says,"Can we prepare a chronological order and Geographical sketch of our Ancient Indian History and Ancient India with the help of our ancient Indian Literature?**

To this question my answer is affirmative. As I have been studying there is a sure possibility of preparing chronological order from the times of the Mahabharata to the period of Nandas and Chanakya. I couldfind out some reliable literary sources to establish this."

My response: I am looking forward to your postings. All of us have trust in your ability and your true academic spirit. Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
