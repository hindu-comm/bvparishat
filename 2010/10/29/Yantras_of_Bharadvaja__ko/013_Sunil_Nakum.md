Thank you all for taking out your valuable time in responding to my email.

  

Sri Nagaraj-ji, Jaya Prakash-ji andGauri-ji,

Your pointers are really helpful and I will read through them, specifically the commentary on Brihad VimanikaShastra by Swami Brahmamuni Parivrajak.

  

Sreedhar-ji, thank you for sharing that critical study. That is amongst the most widely circulated and celebrated documents on this subject, unfortunately.

  

Thanks& Regards,

Sunil K Nakum
