Respected Scholars, Namaskar!

Recent postings, " I read a work by Late Pt. G.R. Josyer titled "**Maharṣi Bhāradvāja on Yantras or Machanisms".**

****

We hear about Bharadwaja's Vaimanika Shastra book. Now there are airplane manufacturing plants (one in Nasika-Mig Russian Blueprint-airplanes),other in Bangalorein India. Did any modern aeronautical engineer working either in industry or academic try to build airplane based on this book?One scientist from Hyderabad made alloys based on information given in this book. Are thermodynamic phase diagrams of such new alloys published in scientific journals? If yes, please give us reference.



India had non-rusting pole near Delhi. During my visit to India, I visited couple of Engineering Colleges. I asked their metallurgy departments to show me the photo micrograph of that non-rusting alloy. They say they do not have it. If I were teaching in India, I will show that on the first day in class.

Mechanical engineering graduates coming from India to USA did not know about the tough steel of the ancient India. Michael Faraday, the electromagnetic fame British scientist was on secret mission to find the composition of this steel. He could not do it. Russian scientist found it in 1850. I send my published paper on this subject to Dr. D. Bhattacarya last year.



In this connection I have one more question. The epic Mahabharat describes a floating city. Who made it? and where in the ancient world? Is there any truth in it or just poetical imagination? Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
