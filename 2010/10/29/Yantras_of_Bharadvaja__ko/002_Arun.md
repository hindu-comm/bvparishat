I have written commentaries on ancient texts of astronomy and in that  
context had to read parts of yantra-sarvasva also. Strictly speaking  
there is no surviving text of astronomy or aeronautics. We do not have  
any text on metallurgy also-there are some books named Rasa-shastra.  
All these are just summaries in sanskrit verses to remember basic  
formulas or names. It is not possible to make a design only on basis  
of available verses. I do not know how Sri Josier made these diagrams-  
but these designs cannnot fly. Bhaskara-1 has commented in his  
explanation of Aryabhatiya that none of the methods are by Aryabhata  
and the book was too small even to contain the summary. The methods  
had been taken from 4 treatises named-Maskari, Purana, Putana and  
Mudgala-these may be parallel to 4 branches of modern math. However,  
there are many common matters in normal history which indicate high  
development of science in whole world in ancient times-  
(1) It is stated that copper age was primitive and prior to iron age.  
Our whole analysis of archeological remains is based on that. But a  
school student reads contradictory things in text book of chemistry.  
Metallurgy of copper is much more difficult than that of iron-it  
cannot be reduced by carbon. Iron can be extracted by any crude  
village equipment. but not copper. Even prospecting of copper is more  
difficult-it is still a guess work. How copper mines were located in  
ancient times? Certainly, whole earth surface was not dug up. Even  
after digging, copper mineral needs to be identified. A chemistry  
graduate takes 6 hours of testing to identify it and many times it is  
wrong. Location of gold and diamond is still more difficult. Jambunada-  
svarna (Zimbabwe-king Soloman) or silver from Mexico were famous.  
There is no step in metallurgy of silver for naming it as makshikah-it  
is related to Mexico only-how and when?  
(2) Indian texts have used 4 main reference points at interval of 90  
degree longitude. All puranas tell that Bharatavarsha covers 1/4 of  
the circle of earth, i.e. 1 of the 4 petals of earth lotus. In same  
sense jain astronomy tells that Meru has 4 faces of 4 colours. Meru is  
a mathematical construction-not a mountain like Himalayas-as made  
distinct in Gita, chapter 11.This means that north hemisphere was  
mapped into 4 sheets. Only then we can say about 4 cardinal points on  
earth as reference. Whether central reference is Ujjan or Lanka, it  
needs world wide survey. Even Alexander knew approximate map of  
Europe, India and Africa-only through them his attack could be  
planned. His army of 120000 went from Makran coast by ship to Ezypt.  
That needs massive ship construction, map of Arabian sea and  
navigation by longitude, latitude and dircetion. Journey of Columbus  
was planned on basis of Piri Reis map which showed 2 land masses of  
Antarctica also. He knew about American land mass-may be unaware about  
name-his planning of food etc was only for that distance-not for India  
by circling the earth.  
(3) Distances of planets, orbit measures and slow motions in billion  
years had been measured. Measures of galaxy have been written in all  
texts of astronomy and Mayan Codex. These are still incomplete.  
(4) Many concepts of advanced maths have been used in texts of  
astronomy which are beyond M.Sc.(math)-but original texts explaining  
them are not available.  
(5) Methods of Ayurveda, surgery and yogic methods are stiil  
unexplained-Arun

\> October 29, 2010 Respected Scholars, Namaskar!Recent postings, " I read a work by Late Pt. G.R. Josyer titled "Maharṣi Bhāradvāja on Yantras or Machanisms". We hear about Bharadwaja's Vaimanika Shastra book. Now there are airplane manufacturing plants (one in Nasika-Mig Russian Blueprint-airplanes),other in Bangalore in India. Did any modern aeronautical engineer working either in industry or academic try to build airplane based on this book? One scientist from Hyderabad made alloys based on information given in this book. Are thermodynamic phase diagrams of such new alloys published in scientific journals? If yes, please give us reference. India had non-rusting pole near Delhi. During my visit to India, I visited couple of Engineering Colleges. I asked their metallurgy departments to show me the photo micrograph of that non-rusting alloy. They say they do not have it. If I were teaching in India, I will show that on the first day in class.Mechanical engineering graduates coming from India to USA did not know about the tough steel of the ancient India. Michael Faraday, the electromagnetic fame British scientist was on secret mission to find the composition of this steel. He could not do it. Russian scientist found it in 1850. I send my published paper on this subject to Dr. D. Bhattacarya last year. In this connection I have one more question. The epic Mahabharat describes a floating city. Who made it? and where in the ancient world? Is there any truth in it or just poetical imagination? Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
