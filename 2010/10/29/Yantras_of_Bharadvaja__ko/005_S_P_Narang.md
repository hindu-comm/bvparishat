A few scholars are trying to resore the plane as depicted in the Vimanasastra. But even after 10 years, they are not able to produce a small smoke in the glass they are exhibiting. Its depiction is very complicated and ultra-scientific knowledge. But the external ingredients are very very antique in nature. Can a scholar explain the real nature of the Vimaana independent of the modern concepts of science which was developed very slowly? Try to evolve the wonderful concept of Vimana in reality. Otherwise, boasting becomes useless. Regards, spnarang
