Respected Scholars,

  

I'm in the process of collecting authentic texts which involve our ancient Vimana descriptions for an upcoming project at[Shastra Krida](http://shastrakrida.org/). There are umpteen documentation on the name of Vimanika (Vymanika) Shastra but most of them are just shallow research papers full in English with no Sanskrit verses or very few verses.

  

To my knowledgethe original/ancient work byMaharshi Bharadwaja and Bhoja with tiles listed below are not fully available at least in the open domain.

  

Yantra Sarvaswa(with a chapter 54th on Vimana),

Brihad Vimanika Shastra,

Amshubodhini ([Chapter-1 is available on archive.org](https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.102389/page/n3/mode/2up)),

Samarangana Sutradhara,  

  

However, I could trace few threads (link below) from BVP members (ex-members) who possessed it in partial or a commentary on Yantrasarvasva (Vaimanikaprakaranam -savrtti-vrtti by Bodhananda). Since it was pretty old thread (2009) and some of the members already left BVP, I'm not sure who else are in possession of these works and could share it. So a humble request to share it if you have it or at least provide the contact information who might have it.

  

\- [a question](https://groups.google.com/g/bvparishat/c/_Uyc_LSnqNM/m/O3wG9XoUtZsJ)

-[Yantras of Bharadvaja](https://groups.google.com/g/bvparishat/c/koxqI-eZy_s/m/gHQI9FXMUmEJ)

by Dr. Rani Sadasiva Murty, Sri Mukund Wadekar,  

  

If it helps, just clarifying on the requirements side, that myangle of study would be quite different than most of the other BVP membersirrespective of the varied subjects being discussed across disciplines. We are more interested in studying the Vimana's shapes, the other technical details and working principle (I don't think we have it) are of secondary importance.

  

Thanks & Regards,

Sunil K Nakum
