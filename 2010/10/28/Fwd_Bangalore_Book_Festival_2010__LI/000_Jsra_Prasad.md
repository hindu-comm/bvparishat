*Dear Friends,*

*Swami Vivekananda had a great vision for the youth of our country. With a clear philosophy of life along with proper understanding of Values and Culture, youth can be developed into beacon lights and can be involved in Nation Building Activities.*

*As a part of Value Education Programme, our Math is participating in various book fairs wherein ourpublications are exhibited and ideas regarding the "Value Education" are counselled.*

*In order to introduce the Great Teachings of Swami Vivekananda, to the youth, our Math distributes a complementary book "Vivekananda - His Call to the Nation" to the youth who visit these fairs.*

*This yearalso our Math is going to participate inthe Annual Bangalore Book festival 2010 to be held from 12th to 21st November at Vishala Vihar, Palace Grounds, Bangalore.*



*Those who are stationed in Bangalore are cordially invited to visit the stall. About 2 lakh people will be attending this Book Festival. We are planning to give the complimentary books to about 25,000 youth.*
