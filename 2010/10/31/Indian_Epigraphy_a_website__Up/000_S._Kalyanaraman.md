Indian Epigraphy

  

Lielukhine D. N of Oriental Institute, Russia has set up a remarkable website <http://indepigr.narod.ru/index_1.htm> “The basic purpose of the present site is the creation of a compact, systematic and critical repository of Indian epigraphical sources.”

\[quote\] Please feel free to contact with me by different themas on[l...@lel.msk.ru]() Especially I needed to contact and active cooperation with indologists or sanscritologists, working with Indian Epigraphy for development of quantity and quality of e-publications of epigraphical texts, which can be available for all interesting. And though the work under publications will be continued, I am very interesting with any form of sponsorship of this form of work.
\[unquote\]

Of particular interest are collections of Sanskrit epigraphy, Inscriptions of Ashoka on Pillar edicts and Rock edicts.
