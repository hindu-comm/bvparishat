Panis are very well known in the RV and have relation to the milk/cows etc. A  
few scholars think that it is the contributions of the Panis that cheese was  
invented. That is why it is called Panir. It has no IE cognate word. The  
etymology of cheese is also to be searched. A similar word in local languages in  
Panjab for a similar item is khees which may have relation to Ksiira. It is  
open for comments. Regards, spnarang
