There is an interesting co-relation. Prior to the bringing of Ganga by Bhagiratha, there was a growth of  
S'ara in the modern Uttarakhanda. But with bringing of the Ganga from the Himalayas, the growth of sugar-cane began. The structure of S'ara and sugar-cane is similar. Uttarakhanda is best producing sugar-cane. The Ganga has abundant of Saligrams which may be the reason of the growth of sugar-cane. Scientists may shed more light to their similarity. Kalidasa has alluded to atyaadityam hutavahamukhe sambhrtam taddhi tejah along with s'aravanabhava. Kalidasa might have known this scientific fact who has alluded to the interesting fact of dhuumajyotihsalilamurtaam for the cloud. The sweet element may be the contribution of S'aaligraama. Please investigate in Caraka and Ayurvedic texts regarding this fact where the varieties of properties of water are also available. Best regards, spnarang
