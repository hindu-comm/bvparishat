***Respected scholars,***

***I am writing this email, not for for any scholarly information, but to satisfy my craving for good (tasty) food. The email of Shree Deepak Bhattacharya is interesting and though provoking.***

***I enjoy, and I am sure many of our friends enjoy, Amul cheese (not other verieties of cheese), Amul Shreekhand (and many vereities of home made Shreekhand), Sweet curd (Misti Doi as well as sweet curd of Mother Diary in addition to the home made varieties) and of course good old curd with sugar or salt. We also enjoy preparations of curd with other food items like Sattu, Chiwda, Potato, Tomato, Brinjal etc.***

***However I had never heard of powdered dry curd of Bihar. Is it available in the market?***

***With regards,***

***Yours truly,***

***D.D.Misra
