\[quote\]According to Hindu tradition, the Shaligram stone is the shelter for a small insect known as the 'vajra-keeta' that cuts through this stone and lives inside it. In actuality, however, these stones are the fossils of the common ammonite that lived millions of years ago when the Himalayan mountain range formed the bed of a vast ocean floor.**Where Are Shaligrams Found?**  
Deep in the recesses of the high Himalayas in the region north-west of Nepal, the Shaligrams are found in the bed of the Gandaki river that flows through Mukti Chhetra and Damodar Kunda.The actual place where Shaligrams are found is itself known by that very name and is regarded as one of the 108 sacred pilgrimage spots for the Vaishnavas, outside India. In fact, so sacred is this place that the Puranic scriptures make a special mention that any stone from this place is equally sacred as a Shaligram.**Characteristics Of Shaligrams**The marks made by the shell of the ammonite give a Shaligram its characteristic appearance, with the pattern often resembling and representing the 'Sudarshan Chakra' or the discus with a sharp-toothed edge which rests on the index finger of Lord Vishnu.\[unquote\]<http://www.indiayogi.com/content/shaligram/>
