Dear Sadashivamurthy,

Thanks for the information. I was not really aware of Saligrama shila making the curds sweet?

Do you have any more information on this, like any specific chemical reactions that gets triggered only with this type of shila?

Also unrelated to this posting, can anybody highlight why we give so much prominence to Saligrama shila? (apart from saying it is just a sacred traditionally).



Thanks

Pavamana
