Sattu is saktu of the RV and its filtering is also mentioned. Full professionals are Sachdev in Panjab. It is ground roasted barley which was the only food in the RV before the godhuuma and gram. Its mixture with water, guda; curd and guda. From Panjab, it has become less but in UP and Bihar, it is frequently eaten. It is used both in liquid form and dense form. Even today we are using it with Roohafza or Thandai in summer because it is cool in property vis-a-vis gram and godhuuma. If reverted back and used, it can heal a number of diseases arising out of heat particularly in summer. It is a full food and does not require rice, roti or gram with it. Kamabha may be an extinct product and quite possible was a food for the animals particularly goats etc. It was just like the modern dog-food with different ingredients. Caraka may be checked in this connection. Regards, spnarang
