Panis are frequentlyreferred to in the RV and Yaska identifies them with Vanik. I never said they were cow lifters. Their profession was the sale of the cows and cow-products. Cheese is not only tinned but produced in the house also. A number of types of cheese are available throughout the word. That is why the etymology of a few scholars is their association with Panir: may be right or wrong. Regards, spnarang
