Sattu is derived from Saktu as in -saktumiva Titauna punanto (Rik  
10/71/2)= words should be filtered as saktu is filtered with a seive.  
This dialogue is very common in marriage songs of Varanasi region.  
However, this region suffered mass murders in each village after 1857  
( 3000 hanged in my village Paiga near Ara, 5500 hanged in Gamharia  
near Moghalsarai). Total of about 10 millions were butchered by  
British and 3 millions sent as slaves in Mauritius, Guyana, Trinidad  
etc (see-War of Civilizations-Amaresh Mishra in 2 vols, 2008). Region  
has not recovered fully from holocast. Trend of labour migration from  
Saktu region still continues and Saktu is a derogatory word and abuse  
for labourers from regions around Varanasi in Punjab, Gujrat, Mumbai.  
There is a peculiar effect of sub-Himalayan grasses in Madhepura  
district of north Bihar, which makes curd hard solid, by any simple  
fermentation. On my request Sri Subodh Kumar has analysed it and  
probably isolated that component-Arun
