Dear Jayanti:



 Kind of you to congratulate me. I am returning Novemebr 17.



 My talks on vedanta and quantun reality have been highly popular in UK and the U.S. I will see if I can give a similar talk in Bangalore. MIT has suggested that I teach a course on the topic next year.



Best wishes and happy Deepavali to you and Manohar,

Rajaram
