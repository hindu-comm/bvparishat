***ABSTRACT***

  
 The landmark decision by the Allahabad High Court on the existence of temples at the  
site where the Babri Masjid was built in 1528 is based on archaeological and literary evidence  
going back nearly two thousand years. The talk will present the literary and archaeological  
evidence, including inscriptions that clinched the case for the temple destruction in 1528.  
The presentation will also draw attention to the systematic falsification and fabrication of  
history by a school of historians driven by political biases. It will show how the formula  
suggested by the Court could have been arrived at more than 20 years ago but was subverted by  
these ‘scholars’ resulting in massive loss of life.

  
 The talk will also highlight the Jihad ideology that led to the destruction of the Ayodhya Temple  
and many others, and how the **same ideology is now at work in the demand for a mosque at  
Ground Zero the World Trade Center was destroyed by a Jihadi attack on 9/11/2001.**
