Respected Scholars, Namaskar.

It has been brought to my notice by a good friend of mine that Sri Upadhyaya has made adversary comments about my dating of the Mahabharata war in this forum. In particular, in one post he says “persons are creating new dates to show their research.. Sri Narahari achar has applied eclipse data-but there is no reference of 3 eclipses in Mahabharata war. It started on Amavasya and there could be solar eclipse after 1 month –not on the date of killing Jayadratha. He has fitted the data of Mahabharata year 36 years after the kali instead of 36 years before that….”

Please note these facts from Udyoga parva :

1. Krishna leaves Upaplavya nagara on a mission of peace on revati nakshatra of kaumudi (kartika) masa and arrives in Hastinapura on bharani nakshatra. That day or the next is Pornima, Kartika pornima. A lunar eclipse takes place that day.

2. He stays in Hastinapura for seven or eight days and leaves Hastinapura on uttaraphalguni day, when Karna rides with him and they have a conversation

3. During the conversation, Karna refers to this lunar eclipse (somasya lakshma vyavrttam…)

4. Krishna sends the message to Drona and Bhishma about the amavasya that is going to happen in seven days at Jyeshtha nakshatra. (saptamachchapi divasad amavasya bhavishyati….)

5. Karna refers to the fact that it will be a solar eclipse day ( rahurarkamupeshyati).

And then they part ways.

Note that two eclipses have been referred to, a lunar eclipse that has already occurred and a solar eclipse that is about to occur. The separation between the two eclipses seems to be normal about fifteen days, and neither Krishna nor Karna make any reference to the interval between the two eclipses. Further more the Kartika Pornioma lunar eclipse has already taken place.

Now move to Bhishma parva. Vyasa meets with Dhritarashtra on the eve of the war.

1. Vyasa refers to the lunar eclipse on Kartika Pornima, which must have happened some time ago when Krishna was still in Hastinapura and not on the eve of the war, as assumed by some people.

(alaksheprabhayahinam purnamasim cha kartikim)

2. Then Vyasa refers to a pair of eclipses that have occurred within 13 days and expresses his surprise at the occurrence

He could not be referring to the solar eclipse that followed the lunar eclipse at Kartika Pornima, as forming the pair. Krishna had already spent eight days when he refers to the amavasya occurring seven more days later. It was Karna who notes it to be a solar eclipse day, but he does not say anything about the interval between the two eclipses.



However, Vyasa observed a pair with an interval of 13 days. Therefore it follows that Vyasa must be referring to a third eclipse, which follows the solar eclipse within 13 days, and it must be this that had been observed by Vyasa, but not by Krishna or Karna, for it had not happened at the time of their conversation.

The planetarium software shows exactly this phenomenon, a sequence of three eclipses occurring in an eclipse season , a lunar eclipse, then a solar eclipse followed by a lunar eclipse. If the last lunar eclipse happens to be a penumbral eclipse, it is possible to get an eclipse ”aparvani”



I have nowhere referred to a sequence of three solar eclipses, which Sri Upadhyaya alleges in one of his postings. I have not applied eclipse data to determine the date, but only in a supporting role. He has confused me with Dr. Iyengar, who does use eclipse data for the purpose of fixing the date and who refers to a sequence of three solar eclipses, SE1, SE2 and SE3. But, these eclipses refer to a sequence which occur at different places and different times, with separations of15 and 36 years , and not to two eclipses occurring within 13 days. These eclipses are mentioned in the epic. Dr. Iyengar’s handling of the eclipse data is quite consistent (even though we do not agree with each other on the date)



*There is no reference to the war having taken place before the Kaliyuga in the epic*. All the epic says is ‘antare chaiva samprapte kali dvaparayoabhut”, the war occurred in the sandhi between the dvapara and kali. In fact, on the last day of the war, when Balarama is upset because of the non-dharmic way Bhima hit Duryodhana, Krishna says “praptam kaliyugam viddhi…” indicating that the Kali had already entered. The Feb 17/18 3102 BCE date serves as the reference point (zero) for panchanga calculations of planetary orbits for the ahargana method(the number of days elapsed). It is not the same as the Kali yuga in the Dharma sense, for which there is only a diffuse beginning, with the ‘sandhi’ giving a range +/- 100 years or so. It is not significant if it is 36 years before or after the 3102 date.



*The war did not start on an amavasya*. The fourteenth day of the war, when Ghatotkacha is killed, they continue to fight, breaking the rules of war well into the night. They stop only when the moon rises early in the morning. If the war had started on an amavasya, the fourteenth day would be close to Pornima and the moon would rise near sunset and not at the early hours of morning.



Perhaps it would not be out of place to show that the *date of the Mahabharata in my work war was derived* (and not fitted the year of the Mahabharata war to anything).

There are only a few astronomical references common to both Udyoga parva and Bhishma parva. These include Shani at Rohini, lunar eclipse at Kartika pornima and solar eclipse at Jyeshtha nakshatra. One additional data from udyoga parva that Mars is retrograde before reaching Jyeshtha is used in *deriving the date.* Since Shani takes about 29.5 years for one complete revolution, a search is made for all years in which Shani is in conjunction with Rohini between 3500 BCE and 500 CE. In this range there are only 137 dates in which Shani is near Rohini. Looking for retrograde Mars before reaching Jyeshtha, reduces this set to 17. Looking for lunar eclipse on Kartika pornima picks out from this set 3067 BCE and 2183 BCE. On these two dates Shani is near Rohini, Mars is retrograde before reaching Jyeshtha, there is a lunar eclipse at Kartika pornima followed by a solar eclipse at Jyeshtha. If one notes the fact that Bhishma expired on Magha shukla ashtami after the winter solstice, it yields a unique date 3067 BCE as the winter solstice occurs in the shukla paksha, where as in 2183 BCE it occurs in the Krishna paksha.

What is astonishing is that all other astronomical data are consistent with this date.  

Having derived the date, arguments are provided to explain consistently all the other astronomical information in the epic which might look discordant.  

*The date of 3067 BCE is derived on the basis of data common to both Udyoga Parva and Bhishma parva*. Dates derived from other data in the epic do not have the same quotient of validity. One may dispute whether Shani is at Rohini, whether mars is retrograde near Jyeshtha, whether Lunar eclipsed occurred on Kartika pornima and whether the solar eclipse occurred at Jyeshtha. If these are accepted as the basic data, the conclusion is inevitable. The date of war is 3067 BCE, not withstanding Sri Upadhyayas’s lamentations. His objections to explanations of all other astronomical information from the epic do not amount to a whole lot of beans.



I do not have either the time or the energy to go on debating every scholar that comes along with a list of objections without understanding the basic logic, although it seems it should be done just to keep down the noise.

I do hope the scholars see the logic and accept or reject it.

Thanks for your patience.  

Sincerely

Narahari Achar
