Respected scholars: The relation to Astamii (durga)and Dasarha ( Rama) is an accident or a regular one? Is it the amulgamation of two streams as a synthesis. sometimes Ramjan is also in these days or different due to moon. Less is about Rama in Durga tradition. Please reply with historical evidence of the events. Regards, spnarang
