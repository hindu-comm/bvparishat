***Dear Dr. Kalayanaraman,***

***I feel the misconception about Hindus destroying Buddhist places of worship might have arisen from Kalki Purana describing the war between Kalki Avatar and the Boudhas.***

***This description has been widely publicised by the Hindu baiters.***

***I have never heard of any Jain temple being desecrated.***

***However I am told that quite a few Hindu temples in Western Orissa were plundered even by the Marathas (Badgis) in the name of Chouth; but it was all after Shivaji and it is evident that the tradition of plundering was learnt from the Moghuls.***

***With regards,***

***Yours truly,***

***D.D.Misra***
