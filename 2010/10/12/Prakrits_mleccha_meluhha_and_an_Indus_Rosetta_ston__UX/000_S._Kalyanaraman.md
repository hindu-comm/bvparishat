Prakrits (mleccha, meluhha) and an Indus Rosetta stone



  

The Sanskrit word*varishtha*forcopper/bronze (Amarakosha) has cognate*Varis/Varish*in Lithunian and Latavian.



The word med in Russian to denote 'copper' is from meD in Munda languages meaning 'metal, iron'. That Prakrits (mleccha, meluhha) are the foundation for the Indus Script is my thesis. In my view, the entire structure of the script has been fully and convincingly decrypted.

  

This will stand the test of cryptographic mathematical scrutiny because thousands of glyptic elements have been identified and over 300,000 etyma of the Indian sprachbund (language union) are demonstrated which meet the statistical sample needs of unicity distance in mathematical theory of communication.

  

Please see the ayakaara slide attached based on a vivid tablet with Indus script. This is the Indus Rosetta stone.<https://sites.google.com/site/kalyan97/_/rsrc/1286887837071/indus-script-cipher/ayakaara.JPG>

  

jasta 'zinc' is cognate with satthia 'the svastika glyph'. It is so important an ingredient to convert copper to look like gold -- shiny brass. The metal is used for temple roofs and also in early coins. Hence, the sacredness associated with the glyph.

Excerpts from the review of Indus Script Cipher by V. Sundaram, I.A.S.:

For more than 130 years, the*Indus script*has posed an insurmountable challenge to the research scholars all over the world. It has remained a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma to scholars of different languages, writing systems and civilization studies. It is now common knowledge that the*Indus script*was invented and used over an extensive area of what is*cIndian alled*the Indus orSindhu-Sarasvati Civilization. More than 2,000 or 80% of the ancient archaeological sites are found on theSarasvati River Basin, a river famed in tradition, song and legend in the timeless history of*Bharatvarsha***--- adored in grandiloquent terms in the oldest human document in the world called the*RIG VEDA*.The sacredSarasvati River, after the elapse of several centuries, got dried up on account of tectonic and consequential river migration causes…

Dr.Kalyanaraman’s new work INDUS SCRIPT CIPHERachieves a revolutionary break-through, a magnificently successful decryption of the key used in the Indus Script Code. The key is‘*Rebus Method’applied to the underlying language of the LINGUISTIC AREA of South Asia. In my view this concept of Linguistic Area is a major contribution to our understanding the cultural history of Saraswati Sindhu Civilization.*

*To quote the words of Dr.Kalyanaraman in his new work ‘Indus Script Cipher’: “Decryption draws upon the database of 8000 semantic clusters of glosses, from an*INDIAN LEXICON,*a multi-lingual comparative dictionary of over 25 ancient Indian Languages, painstakingly compiled in 3 volumes over 20 years*(*please see the front cover of this lexicon displayed above)*.*Decrypted Indian script reveals that artisans—lapidaries, masons, carpenters, miners and smiths---of the civilization working with stones, wood, ivory, shell, minerals, metals and alloys of metals, created the Indus Writing System to record 1) the characteristics of artifacts produced by them and 2) techniques used.*The principal thesis of decryption of Indian Script Cipher is that, in the Indian Linguistic Area, artisans of proto-indic language families Indo-Aryan, Munda(Kol) and Dravidian interacted with one another, absorbed many glosses and structural language features from one another. Complemented by recent advances in the method of areal linguistics,***REBUS METHOD***is applied to glyptic elements to decode*Indus Writing System.*Given the fact that the 3 language families are a*Sprachbund*(language union), with cultural contact situations and history of phonetic changes, of semantic expansions, the glosses common to two or more of these language families constitute the*INDUS LANGUAGE LEXICON.”*

…Dr S. Kalyanaraman’s bold, spirited and innovative attempt to decipher the*Indus script*and thehieroglyphsof theSarasvati-Sindhu Civilizationis very much on the lines followed byJean-Francois Champollion (1790-1832),the[French](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France "France")classical[scholar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academia "Academia"),[philologist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philology "Philology")and[orientalist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oriental_studies "Oriental studies")who*deciphered*the*Egyptian hieroglyphs*in1822.Champolliontranslated parts of theRosetta Stonein 1822, showing that the*Egyptian writing system*was a combination of*phonetic*and*ideographic signs*.Champolliondeciphered the*Egyptian***hieroglyphsbased on the pioneering groundwork done by his predecessors:[Athanasius Kircher](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athanasius_Kircher "Athanasius Kircher")(1602–1680), Silvestre de Sacy(1758-1838), Johan David Akerblad (1763-1819),[Thomas Young](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Young_(scientist) "Thomas Young (scientist)")(1773-1829), and William John Bankes(1786-1855)....

Dr.Kalyanaraman has applied the broad principles evolved by Jean François Champollion for the understanding of the Egyptian language to the decipherment of the Indus Script Cipher, even without having the advantage of having a Rosetta Stone. To quote Kalyanaraman’s words in this context: “*Indus Script Cipher***makes history recording hundreds of hieroglyphs of India. Absence of aRosetta Stone**which******has been the principal impediment in validating any decryption of**Indus Script Cipher**is thus overcome**.**Further validation comes from evidences of the historical periods in India from**c.600 BCE**showing continued use of**Indus Script Hieroglyphs**which evolved from**c.3300 BCE.**This book details a**decipherment*of the*Indus Script**using the same**Rebus Method**used by**Champollian**to read ancient**phonetic hieroglyphs of India.”

WHATDR.S.KALYANARAMAN HAS ACHIEVED IN SO MAGNIFICENT AND SO RESPLENDENT A MANNER IN DECIPHERING THE INDUS SCRIPT CIPHER BY A THOROUGH AND INTENSIVE EXAMINATION*OFTHE HIEROGLYPHS OF INDIAN LINGUISTIC AREA*IN HIS NEW BOOK ONLY TAKES THIS FORMIDABLE, COMPLICATED AND COMPLEX TASK TO SOME REASONABLE CONCLUSION…

I would like to conclude theIpart of my review ofDr.Kalyanaraman’snew bookINDUS SCRIPT CIPHERwith the following observations ofSir.John Marshall:

…“In this study of the inscriptions of the early seals of the*Indus Valley*I have deliberately stated thatthe early Indian alphabetknown as the*Brahmi**script*, isderived from the ancient***Indus pictographic writing,*and I have identified the origin of many*Brahmi*characters with confidence. In my*sign list*the phonetic values of the derived alphabetic characters have been inserted, but I do not wish to convey the inference that these are the correct values of the ideograms, any more than the*Phoenician alphabet*represents the values of the*Egyptian**pictographs*from which they are derived. It is highly improbable that the signs of the*Indus script*have reached thesyllabic stage, that is,*a consonant + a vowel*like in*Brahmi alphabet*. Many of them may possibly be so used, and used as phonetic elements in the writing of the words, as many*Sumerian pictographs*are in the oldest known*Sumerian texts*. If the roots of this unknown language arebi-consonantal, as in*Sumerian*and*Indo-Germanic languages,*then it follows that thesyllabic values, such as*ba, ta, ga,*etc.,*tad, tag, tab,*etc.,***gal, gan, gab,*etc.IT IS NO MORE POSSIBLE TO TRANSLITERATE THE INDUS SIGNS FROM THE DERIVED BRAHMI ALPHABET THAN TO OPERATE IN THE SAME MANNER ON THE EGYPTIAN HIEROGLYPHS WITH THE DERIVED PHOENICIAN ALPHABET.Here we have, already from the seals, a sign list approaching 300 numbers; obviously the initial consonants of a very restricted proportion would be known, even in the successful identification of all the 45 Brahmi characters.”

“The proper names and names of profession on these seals do not supply sufficient material for successful decipherment.It is not possible to separate word and sign groups; the declensions and verb inflections cannot be detected here, and the pronouns are entirely absent. Until longer inscriptions of a literary and historical character, are discovered, not much advancement in the interpretation can be expected. A good many important facts can be determined, however, to clear the ground for more satisfactory research.In the first place this script is in no way even remotely connected with either*Sumerian*or*proto-Elamitic signs*. I have compared some of these*signs*with some of these*scripts*. For the references to the Sumerian pictographs, or the earliest forms of the Sumerian signs, I have referred the readers to the numbers of the*REC*(Thureau-Dangin,*Recherches sur l’ Origine de l’Ecriture Cuneiforme*),and for the*proto-Elamitic signs*toProfessor Scheil’s “*Textes de Compatibilite proto-Elamites”*, invol xvii**of*Memoires de la Mission Archeologique de Perse,*pp. 31-66. This series is commonly cited as*Del. Per. (Delegation en Perse)*.The*Indus inscriptions*resemble the*Egyptian hieroglyphs*far more than they do the*Sumerian linear and cuneiform system.*And secondly, the presence of the detached accents in the*Indus**scripts*is a feature that distinguishes it from any of these systems. Although vowels must be inherent in all the signs, nevertheless some of the signs and accents must be pure vowel signs. For this reason alone it is necessary to resign further investigation to*Sanskrit scholars*. If future discoveries make it possible to transliterate these signs, and the language proves to be agglutinative, it will be a problem for Sumeroligists. I am convinced that all attempts to derive the Brahmi alphabet from Semitic alphabets were complete failures.”
