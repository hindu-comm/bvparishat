sabhAyai nama:

I came across this note about a verse in praise of kavikulaguru  
Kalidasa. This was inscribed across the legs of an elephant in stone  
at Molakalmuru Karnataka state. This was recorded in Epigraphica  
Karnataka. The verse goes like this:

कंजरं पुरतेद्रंचं  
महेन्दालिसदालिका  
कालिदासलिदहेमा  
चन्द्रं तेरपुरञ्जकं

There is bound to be mistakes, as I had transliterated this from  
English to Devanagari. I am eager to get the proper Devanagari version  
of this beautiful ambigramatic shloka.

Please help.

Dhanyavaada:  
Srikanth.
