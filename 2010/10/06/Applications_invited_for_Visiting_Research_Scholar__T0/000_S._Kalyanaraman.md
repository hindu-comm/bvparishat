# Visiting Research Scholars Program, New York University

  
  

Each year the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World makes about 8-10 appointments of visiting research scholars. For a directory of current visiting research scholars (2010-11),[click here](http://www.nyu.edu/isaw/scholars.htm).

ISAW's scope embraces research and graduate education in the history, archaeology, and culture of the entire Old World from late prehistoric times to the eighth century AD, including Asia and Africa. Projects of a theoretical or comparative nature relevant to this domain are also welcome. Academic visitors at ISAW should be individuals of scholarly distinction or promise in any relevant field of ancient studies who will benefit from the stimulation of working in an environment with colleagues in other disciplines. Applicants with a history of interdisciplinary exchange are particularly welcome. They will be expected to be in residence at the Institute during the period for which they are appointed and to take part in the intellectual life of the community.

Visiting Research Scholars at ISAW have access to the Institute's own library, which is in the process of development, as well as to a wide range of other libraries at NYU, the Metropolitan Museum of Art (located a block away), and other institutions in New York City. Scholars are provided with their own workspace.

ISAW is prepared to host visiting research scholars in three categories:

1.  Postdoctoral Fellows appointed for two years. Two such fellows will
    be appointed for 2011-2013. Preference will be given to those who
    have completed the doctorate within the last three years at the time
    of application, but applicants who will have completed all
    requirements for the degree by June 30, 2011, will also be
    considered. These fellows will be expected to lead one research
    seminar at ISAW during the two-year period and teach one
    undergraduate course in an NYU department each year.

2.  Visiting Research Scholars appointed for one year with full or
    partial funding from ISAW. These may be at any career stage from
    postdoctoral to retired; the doctoral degree must be completed no
    later than June 30, 2011. Applicants in category 1 who are not
    awarded two-year fellowships will be considered in category 2.  
      
    Visiting Research Scholars in both of these categories will normally
    bear NYU research track ranks and have regular university benefits.
    Research support is normally a part of funding packages. Applicants
    for these categories are considered in a single competition cycle
    with a fixed deadline each year.

3.  ISAW is prepared to consider applications from postdoctoral scholars
    with their own funding from another source. These scholars have the
    same community privileges as the other two categories and are
    expected to participate in the Institute’s life in the same fashion
    but do not receive any financial support from ISAW. Applicants in
    the category must apply at least one semester in advance of their
    anticipated start date.

A complete application in any category will include a letter of interest, c.v. (including publication list), a research proposal, 3 letters of recommendation, and published writing samples. Applicants should have their doctorates in hand by the beginning of their period of appointment at ISAW. Students still in doctoral programs are not eligible for appointment under this program.

All applications should be made through NYU’s online application system. The links for each category are below. The deadline for category 1 and 2 applications is December 10th, 2010. Applications in category 3 are considered on a rolling basis and should be submitted at least one semester prior to the proposed start date.

Questions should be directed to Kathryn Lawson, Academic Program Coordinator, at[kathryn...@nyu.edu]()or [212-992-7860](tel:(212)%20992-7860).

##### Financial support

Two-year postdoctoral fellows (category 1) are provided with a fixed stipend. In 2011-12 this stipend level is $62,000. This is also the stipend provided to visiting research scholars in category 2 not currently employed, only partially employed, or working in countries where salary levels are substantially different from those in the United States. In the case of visitors with partial or full sabbatical leave salaries from their home institutions or other sources, the Institute will, depending on circumstances, supplement these to provide total compensation comparable to normal salaries or may offer a housing allowance. In addition, visitors in categories 1 and 2 are provided with research allowances to defray the cost of travel to conferences and other out of pocket research expenses.
