Now most of the politicians say it is compromise: nay a mercy over the Hindus. The historical evidences given are none from Sanskrit sources. Cannot we give the evidences from the Puranas, Prabandhas, sthala-Puranas, contemporary historical sources to prove the continous worship at the place? I remember when the case was going on most of the historians with a particular ideology holding good positions in the field of history including ICHR were coming forward. None of the Sanskrit great scholars gave the evidence or a piece of information. Are we really ignorant of our heritage and literature? I request the scholars to search the texts known to them and come forward for a new evidence. Otherwise politicians will only exploit us. If there is nothing to prove, let us say it clearly that we do not know or Sanskrit does not preserve anything about the issue. Munuccci was a doctor and entered the palaces of the Moghals for the treatment and slowly emerged as a good historian. It is of course, a good accountthe of the palaces and their culture. Butmuch of the information of temples and mosques is missing in this history. Again I request all the Sanskritiststo collect the information jointly and take the issue independently to assist the law and throw out the politicians. Regards, spnarang
