Jayatu Sanskritam Jayatu Bharatam  
I think that discussion on following subjects  
1.OUR INDIAN HISTORY WAS MADE IN ENGLAND  
2. Ramajanmabhoomi verdict: Full text and related documents  
3. What the Islamic Invaders Did to India. by Rizwan Salim  
is baseless as these are only political stunt.

\> It is not negative-it is dishonesty and slave minds. Sole learning of

\> meat.  
\> Meat eating has not been prohibited, there are 3 chapters in Charaka  
\> samhita on that. But it has been called Tamasika and not proper for a  
\> sage. Actually it is strictly prohibite in Bible (Genesis 1/27) and  
\> Korana (Chapter 2-Al bakar -over 6 paragraphs). In Turkey, Al Bakar  
\> has been translated as 'Cow' and bakrid means worship of cow.

\> 120,000 prophets in world including Rama and Krishna. But in practice

\> famines where millions died. Lysenkoism had the same effect in China under  
\> Mao later, during the Great Leap Forward.  
\>  
\> However, the Soviet Union's nuclear program was led by genuine scientists of

\> huge raises and creature comforts well exceeding the average for that  
\> society (though Stalin was elsewhere adamantly opposed to financial and  
\> other incentives for performance, calling them bourgeois). If the  
\> agricultural scientists who suffered persecution under Stalin and Mao had

\> Thank You Sir!  
\> Namaste!  
\> 1. This should not be a Single Individuals' Deal  
\> Yes! The spirit of this repeated request also is not to crown any single  
\> individual's request. As it has been rightly observed in your present  
\> valuable mail it should be a joint project withcolletive effort of many  
\> scores of scholars, historiographers and scientists.Among the  
\> learnedHistoriographers will takecare of the accuracy of the methodology.  
\> The scientists will vouchsafe the scientific findings that are found in the  
\> search for this project. The most eminent Sanskrit Scholars those who are  
\> experts in various sections of the Sanskrit literature should be consulted  
\> from time to time for attesting the validity of the material collected and  
\> also in the process of translating such material also their role shall be  
\> major. Sometimes even half-knowledged or less knowledged Sanskrit students  
\> also may be of great help in the project provided they are assigned with  
\> appropriate workshare having identified their abilities.  
\> 2. How History Should be Written?  
\> As far as this question is concerned it is rightly said by you that it  
\> should be written on the basis of new facts and figures avaialbe and the  
\> methodology should be historical. It is so in case of writing the history of  
\> any nation for the first time. But under the circumstances when a plethora  
\> of books are dumped in the market in the name of History with volumes of  
\> misrperesentations,large contents withwrong signals to the future  
\> generations andcontaining huge sections withthousands ofignored facts  
\> and missed links a diffrent strategy may be required. It is all the scholars  
\> who will involve in the project may have to decide.  
\> Once agian it is humbly submitted for the consideration of all that it is  
\> not at all for any individual credit of this mailer a proposal of this kind  
\> is mailed. But having felt the necessity of such a project for rectifying  
\> the mistakes committed by the earlier historians this present write-up is  
\> placed on the stock here.  
\> Moreover this ideais not a over night offshoot of an empty brain. Having  
\> equipped with lot of inherited relevant knowledge and with a good support of  
\> information collected through many years where rectification in the history  
\> is necessary this primary representation is submitted.  
\> Before concluding this mail once again it is being reiterated that there is  
\> no first personal eagerness or over enthusiasm in the representing  
\> individual to shoulder a mountain of this kind. But a rocking prapredness is  
\> always here to be one of the best instruments for this noble cause.  
\> Thanks a lot for your right observation and sharp advice Sir! and my humble  
\> pranams to you.

\> Smrithi, Sastra and other kinds of Sanskrit literary texts. Let the new

\> findings.  
\> Of course already such attempts have been in progress from various corners  
\> of the country still as I observed most of them are also again under the  
\> spell of the existing western methods of writing History. Let us choose a  
\> new and healthy methodforrewriting Ancient Indian History.  
\> I shall add my thoughts further more on the response of the learned members.

\>  
\> Respected Scholars of this forum!Pranams to all of you. In the  
\> attachment of this mail I have submitted a breif wirte-up on ''OUR  
\> INDIAN HISTORY WAS MADE IN ENGLAND''. Pl. go through it. If it is  
\> felt meaningful let there be a collective thought and a concrete plan  
\> for reconstruction of our Ancient Indian History with true National  
\> Spirit with its root strength in the Original Vedic, Pauranic,  
\> Smrithi, Sastra and other kinds of Sanskrit literary texts. Let the  
\> new moment may be less dependant on the African or Euorpean  
\> Archeological findings. Of course already such attempts have been in  
\> progress from various corners of the country still as I observed most  
\> of them are also again under the spell of the existing western  
\> methods of writing History. Let us choose a new and healthy  
\> methodforrewriting Ancient Indian History. I shall add my thoughts  
\> further more on the response of the learned members.  
\> With Warm regards to all,

\> Rabble-rousers to political rubble  
\> \*Aijaz Ilmi\*  
\>  
\> Posted online: Fri, Oct 01, 2010  
\>  
\> \*\* The tumultuous acrimony following the Sangh Parivar-sponsored Babri  
\> demolition that nearly dismembered the nation in 1992 was based on the  
\> mobilisation of rampaging mobs out to avenge historical “wrongs.” Will the  
\> verdict of the Allahabad high court after six decades of litigation result  
\> in renewed sabre-rattling? Has the matter of the facts triumphed over the  
\> matter of the faiths?  
\>  
\> The cacophonous crescendo in the visual media, led by shadowy organisations  
\> claiming divine right, over the last few days brought back into focus  
\> lingering, subterranean religious hatred. Something that could possibly  
\> impede our nation’s march towards peace and promised prosperity.  
\>  
\> The shimmering facade of relative equanimity, and the appeals from all  
\> parties to accept the verdict and for composure, has put the onus on all  
\> Indians to bury the past, and to accept the high court’s answers to the  
\> contentious title suit.  
\>  
\> With the verdict dismissing the claim of the Sunni Wakf Board on the land  
\> title, and with credible evidence — as the court opines — to support the  
\> contention that temple ruins existed prior to the construction of the mosque  
\> in 1528, rebuilding the mosque at the same place is now virtually  
\> impossible.  
\>  
\> Secondly, if the title suit itself is dismissed by a majority opinion, why  
\> have the Muslims been given one-third of the entire 67 acres? The court also  
\> puts its seal on the fact that Ram Lalla was born in the disputed site —  
\> which should bring about closure for most right-thinking people.  
\>  
\> The self-anointed guardians of an entire faith, the various arms of the  
\> Sangh Parivar, have always maintained that both the places of worship cannot  
\> co-exist and that they will fight against this legal order and go to the  
\> Supreme Court.  
\>  
\> The once-strutting and now emasculated Muslim organisations, intoxicated  
\> with hollow egotism, will slowly resume rabble-rousing — having contributed  
\> little, except fight for self-aggrandisement.  
\>  
\> They were aptly described by Justice Liberhan as “the now-defunct Muslim  
\> bodies”; he said they “are as culpable as well, for their failure to provide  
\> leadership.”  
\>  
\> The Babri Masjid Action Committee and others should be disbanded and  
\> consigned to political rubble. The silence of Shahabuddin, Azam Khan and  
\> others is deafening — and thankfully we can now expect a more erudite,  
\> younger and inclusive-minded leadership to guide the believers.  
\>  
\> Were the Muslims misled by their self-appointed leaders? It appears that the  
\> angst and the hype they built up is largely responsible for the present  
\> despondency.  
\>  
\> Another significant part of the verdict — about the idols being placed — is  
\> silent on one aspect: who placed them? A more detailed fine reading of the  
\> judgment will probably partially satisfy all parties, and make them more  
\> amenable to rationality and reasoning.  
\>  
\> All political parties will, sooner than later, assess the immediate impact  
\> of this verdict, and then plan their political revival based on the  
\> reactions of the aam aadmi. In the political sweepstakes, perception and  
\> image are of greater import than reality; the canny politician knows what to  
\> peddle to his constituents.  
\>  
\> This litmus test of our nationhood, one based on constitutional democracy  
\> and respect for the law, will test the UPA government to its limits. As in  
\> 1992, any failure to uphold the law, or any clandestine pusillanimity, will  
\> deal a body-blow to the secular fabric of our nation. The pugnacious  
\> Congress general secretary Digvijaya Singh may say he does not trust the VHP  
\> — but the question that needs answering really is: “can the UPA withstand  
\> the test of trustworthiness in upholding the law” in light of the verdict?  
\>  
\> The burden, in our secular state, lies on both the state and the contesting  
\> parties. Whenever the law appears supine, protectors become predators. The  
\> aggrieved parties will move on to the Supreme Court; but this opportunity to  
\> provide closure, to heal the wounds of mutual hatred must be looked into  
\> earnestly.  
\>  
\> The 170 million Indian Muslims will have to reflect on their present  
\> situation if we have to contribute to the betterment of our future  
\> generations. We must go beyond the “victimhood syndrome,” and the double  
\> charge of being both “appeased” and “anti-national” at the same time. And  
\> the change has to be from within. In light of this judgment, the people  
\> responsible for the violent aftermath and tumult should also quickly be  
\> brought to justice, because justice should also be seen and delivered.

\> The meeting commences. on point after point, on document after document,

\> \*Ayodhya: Muslim Argument Examined\*  
\>  
\> \*\*  
\>  
\> \*" \*At first, the demand-cum-assurance was, "If you can bring any proof  
\> showing a temple had been demolished to construct the mosque, we will  
\> ourselves demolish the mosque". A host of documents -- reports of the  
\> Archaeological Survey of India going back to 1891, Gazetteers going back to  
\> 1854, survey reports going back to 1838 were produced which stated  
\> unambiguously that a Ram temple had been demolished to construct the  
\> mosque".  
\>  
\> The demand suddenly changed. "These are all British documents", it was now  
\> said. "The British concocted this story to divide and rule. "Show us some  
\> Pre-British documents" was an invention to get over inconvenient facts. It  
\> became evident soon enough, when in response to Chandrashekhar's initiative  
\> the All India Babri Masjid Action Committee submitted documents, most of  
\> these turned out to be nothing but the rulings of sundry British  
\> magistrates. Worse, they confirmed what the Vishwa Hindu Parishad had been  
\> saying: that the mosque had not been in use since 1936;that it has been  
\> built by demolishing the Ram temple: that the Hindus had, at the cost of  
\> many lives, been trying throughout to capture the spot, as they held it to  
\> be the sacred birth place of Lord Ram.  
\>  
\> In any event, non-British, specifically Muslim documents as well as  
\> pre-British documents, including the account of an Austrian Jesuit priest  
\> who had stayed in Ayodhya in 1766-71 were produced. Each of them stated the  
\> same facts.  
\>  
\> But each of these is only repeating what the other is saying. It was  
\> demanded that show some contemporary document". The demand for such a  
\> document was manifestly a dodge : the one document -- the Babarnama -- which  
\> could have settled the matter is truncated: Babar records his reaching  
\> Ayodhya on 2 April 1528. The pages from then to 18 September 1528 are  
\> missing, and are surmised to have been lost in a storm in May 1529, or  
\> during Humayun's subsequent wanderings in the desert as a fugitive. The  
\> matter, however, was soon nailed. If the absence of a contemporary accounts  
\> - the very day's Court bulletins recording the destruction of the temples of  
\> Mathura, Kashi, Pandharpur and scores and scores of other places and their  
\> replacement by mosques are available proof enough to propel Shahabuddin etc  
\> to demolish those mosques?  
\>  
\> So, archaeology itself was denounced. And sophistry was put out. Irfan Habib  
\> led the charge. But his own howler showed his arguments to be special  
\> pleading: if one went by the dates he ascribed on the basis of "Carbon  
\> dating" and all. Babar would have expired in 1965 instead of 1530, the reign  
\> of Akbar would commence in 2001 instead of having ended in 1605.  
\>  
\> Since then, the case of these pleaders has been made worse by the new finds:  
\> entire walls and floor levels have now come into-view, twelve to fourteen  
\> feet below the surface. No one could have picked these up from a distance  
\> and planted them below the structure.  
\>  
\> At the discussion on Ayodhya which Newstrack organised on  
\>  
\> 1 August , Shahabuddin produced yet another argument. I had just quoted a  
\> signed statement he had distributed to the press as late as 15 June 1989 in  
\> which he had said. "But the Hindu chauvinists are totally confused about  
\> their own case... "Whatever the Hindu chauvinist case, the Muslim community  
\> has, without any legal obligation, offered, as a moral gesture, to demolish  
\> the Babri Masjid -- if it is proved that a temple stood on the site of the  
\> Babri Masjid and it was pulled down to construct the mosque. As the point at  
\> issue accordingly was whether there had been a temple at the site, I said,  
\> we should focus on the archaeological evidence to settle the matter.  
\>  
\> Shahabuddin said that he stood by the statement. His argument was that The  
\> temple just could not have been pulled down as pulling down a place of  
\> worship to construct a mosque is against the Shariat. Incredulous, The  
\> principal correspondent of Newstrack, Manoj Raghuvanshi, later asked  
\> Shahabuddin whether in that case no temple had been demolished by Muslim  
\> rulers. "It is not a historical fact", said Shahabuddin, "that a standing  
\> temple in peace time was demolished by any Muslim ruler". "Assertions to the  
\> contrary", he said, "are all chauvinist propaganda"; Even with the hedging  
\> -- "standing temple", "in peace time" -- that was quite a lump to swallow.  
\> "You  
\> mean even Sonmath was not demolished". Raghuvanshi asked, "Sonmath was  
\> disintegrated," said Shahabuddin, and reaffirmed his thesis that temples  
\> could not have been demolished because pulling them down to build mosques  
\> was against the Shariat.

\> What the Islamic Invaders Did to India  
\>  
\> by Rizwan Salim  
\>  
\> 12 Nov, 2007  
\> On the anniversary of the Babri Masjid demolition (December 6, 1992), it is  
\> important for Hindus (and Muslims) to understand the importance of the event  
\> in the context of Hindustan's history, past and recent, present and the  
\> future. Savages at a very low level of civilisation and no culture worth the  
\> name, from Arabia and west Asia, began entering India from the early century  
\> onwards. Islamic invaders demolished countless Hindu temples, shattered  
\> uncountable sculpture and idols, plundered innumerable palaces and forts of  
\> Hindu kings, killed vast numbers of Hindu men and carried off Hindu women.  
\> This story, the educated-and a lot of even the illiterate Indians-know very  
\> well. History books tell it in remarkable detail. But many Indians do not  
\> seem to recognise that the alien Muslim marauders destroyed the historical  
\> evolution of the earth's most mentally advanced civilisation, the most  
\> richly imaginative culture, and the most vigorously creative society.  
\>  
\> It is clear that India at the time when Muslim invaders turned towards it (8  
\> to 11th century) was the earth's richest region for its wealth in precious  
\> and semi-precious stones, gold and silver, religion and culture, and its  
\> fine arts and letters. Tenth century Hindustan was also too far advanced  
\> than its contemporaries in the East and the West for its achievements in the  
\> realms of speculative philosophy and scientific theorising, mathematics and  
\> knowledge of nature's workings. Hindus of the early medieval period were  
\> unquestionably superior in more things than the Chinese, the Persians  
\> (including the Sassanians), the Romans and the Byzantines of the immediate  
\> proceeding centuries. The followers of Siva and Vishnu on this subcontinent  
\> had created for themselves a society more mentally evolved-joyous and  
\> prosperous too-than had been realised by the Jews, Christians, and Muslim  
\> monotheists of the time. Medieval India, until the Islamic invaders  
\> destroyed it, was history's most richly imaginative culture and one of the  
\> five most advanced civilisations of all times.  
\>  
\> Look at the Hindu art that Muslim iconoclasts severely damaged or destroyed.  
\> Ancient Hindu sculpture is vigorous and sensual in the highest degree-more  
\> fascinating than human figural art created anywhere else on earth. (Only  
\> statues created by classical Greek artists are in the same class as Hindu  
\> temple sculpture). Ancient Hindu temple architecture is the most  
\> awe-inspiring, ornate and spell-binding architectural style found anywhere  
\> in the world. (The Gothic art of cathedrals in France is the only other  
\> religious architecture that is comparable with the intricate architecture of  
\> Hindu temples). No artist of any historical civilisation have ever revealed  
\> the same genius as ancient Hindustan's artists and artisans.  
\>  
\> Their minds filled with venom against the idol-worshippers of Hindustan, the  
\> Muslims destroyed a large number of ancient Hindu temples. This is a  
\> historical fact, mentioned by Muslim chroniclers and others of the time. A  
\> number of temples were merely damaged and remained standing. But a large  
\> number-not hundreds but many thousands-of the ancient temples were broken  
\> into shreds of cracked stone. In the ancient cities of Varanasi and Mathura,  
\> Ujjain and Maheshwar, Jwalamukhi and Dwarka, not one temple survives whole  
\> and intact from the ancient times.  
\>  
\> The wrecking of Hindu temples went on from the early years of the 8th  
\> century to well past 1700 AD a period of almost 1000 years. Every Muslim  
\> ruler in Delhi (or Governor of Provinces) spent most of his time warring  
\> against Hindu kings in the north and the south, the east and the west, and  
\> almost every Muslim Sultan and his army commanders indulged in largescale  
\> destructions of Hindu temples and idols. They also slaughtered a lot of  
\> Hindus. It is easy to conclude that virtually every Hindu temple built in  
\> the ancient times is a perfect work of art. The evidence of the ferocity  
\> with which the Muslim invaders must have struck at the sculptures of gods  
\> and goddesses, demons and apsaras, kings and queens, dancers and musicians  
\> is frightful. At so many ancient temples of Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh,  
\> for example, shattered portions of stone images still lie scattered in the  
\> temple courtyards. Considering the fury used on the idols and sculptures,  
\> the stone-breaking axe must have been applied to thousands upon thousands of  
\> images of hypnotic beauty.

\> Giving proof of the resentment that men belonging to an inferior  
\> civilisation feel upon encountering a superior civilisation of individuals  
\> with a more refined culture, Islamic invaders from Arabia and western Asia  
\> broke and burned everything beautiful they came across in Hindustan. So  
\> morally degenerate were the Muslim Sultans that, rather than attract Hindu  
\> "infidels" to Islam through force of personal example and exhortation, they  
\> just built a number of mosques at the sites of torn down temples-and  
\> foolishly pretended they had triumphed over the minds and culture of the  
\> Hindus. I have seen stones and columns of Hindu temples incorportated into  
\> the architecture of several mosques, including the Jama Masjid and Ahmed  
\> Shah Masjid in Ahmedabad; the mosque in the Uparkot fort of Junagadh  
\> (Gujarat) and in Vidisha (near Bhopal); the Adhai Din Ka Jhonpra right next  
\> to the famous dargah in Ajmer-and the currently controversial Bhojshala  
\> "mosque" in Dhar (near Indore). Hindu culture was at its imaginative best  
\> and vigorously creative when the severely-allergic-to-images Muslims entered  
\> Hindustan. Islamic invaders did not just destroy countless temples and  
\> constructions but also suppressed cultural and religious practices; damaged  
\> the pristine vigour of Hindu religion, prevented the intensification of  
\> Hindu culture, debilitating it permanently, stopped the development of Hindu  
\> arts ended the creative impulse in all realms of thought and action, damaged  
\> the people's cultural pride, disrupted the transmission of values and  
\> wisdom, cultural practices and tradition from one generation to the next;  
\> destroyed the proper historical evolution of Hindu kingdoms and society,  
\> affected severely the acquisition of knowledge, research and reflection and  
\> violated the moral basis of Hindu society. The Hindus suffered immense  
\> psychic damage. The Muslims also plundered the wealth of the Hindu kingdoms,  
\> impoverished the Hindu populace, and destroyed the prosperity of Hindustan.

\> Gaze in wonder at the Kailas Mandir in the Ellora caves and remember that it  
\> is carved out of a solid stone hill, an effort that (inscriptions say) took  
\> nearly 200 years. This is art as devotion. The temple built by the  
\> Rashtrakuta kings (who also built the colossal sculpture in the Elenhanta  
\> caves off Mumbai harbour) gives proof of the ancient Hindus' religious  
\> fervor.  
\>  
\> But the Kailas temple also indicated a will power, a creative imagination,  
\> and an intellect eager to take on the greatest of artistic challenges.  
\>  
\> The descendants of those who built the magnificent temples of Bhojpur and  
\> Thanjavur, Konark and Kailas, invented mathematics and brain surgery,  
\> created mindbody disciplines (yoga) of astonishing power, and built mighty  
\> empires would almost certainly have attained technological superiority over  
\> Europe.  
\>  
\> It is not just for "political reasons" that Hindus want to build grand  
\> temples at the sites of the (wrecked) Babri Masjid in Ayodhya, the Gyanvapi

\> This is almost a Judgment of Solomon, but it will not be the final word. It  
\> is worth noting that the three judge bench consisted of one Muslim and two  
\> Hindus.  
\>  
\> Assuming the judgment to stand challenge in the Supreme Court, it is  
\> unlikely that a mosque and a temple will both be built at the same site. The  
\> best course would be for the Muslims to be offered an alternative site and  
\> help to build a mosque of their own in return for the part of the temple  
\> site awarded to them. Ayodhya is sacred to the Hindus because of its  
\> association with their hero Lord Ram. No such sanctity exists for the  
\> Muslims who claim it as a mark of conquest by the Mogul invader Babar.  
\>  
\> Such a compromise had been offered by the Hindus decades ago, but Muslim  
\> groups rejected it. Had the compromise been accepted, an alternative site  
\> and help in place of the Ram temple site held sacred by the Hindus, much  
\> bloodshed could have been avoided.  
\>  
\> Here is an important lesson for Americans-- the demand for the Islamic  
\> Center at ground zero is no different from the mosque built by Babar in 1528  
\> after demolishing a temple. It is mark of conquest and not a place of  
\> worship. Americans should learn from this history of Ayodhya of building  
\> mosques on sites of destruction.

\> \[\*On Sept. 30, 2010, the Lucknow bench of the Allahabad High Court brought  
\> half-closure to a six-decade old legal dispute in a five-century-old Hindu  
\> struggle to recover the site revered as the birthplace of Maryada

\> \*It has been a long road from 1528 when the Janmabhoomi Mandir was destroyed  
\> and replaced by a mosque at the instance of the invader Babur. On Dec. 6,  
\> 1992, Hindu patience broke down and the structure hurtful to Hindu religious  
\> sentiment was brought down by mob action. On 9 December 1992, three days

\> seminal piece in The Times of India, which silenced all intellectual  
\> opposition or exposed that there was no legitimate intellectual argument

\>

\> 1992 will doubtless go down in Indian history as the \*year of Ayodhya\*. This  
\> is so not so much because recent events there have pushed into the  
\> background all other issues such as economic reforms and reservations for  
\> the ‘other backward castes’ as because they have released forces which will  
\> have a decisive influence in shaping the future of India.  
\>  
\> These forces are not new; they have been at work for two centuries. Indeed,  
\> they were not even wholly bottled up. But they had not been unleashed  
\> earlier as they have been now. It is truly extraordinary that the demolition  
\> of a nondescript structure by faceless men no organization owns up should  
\> have shaken so vast a country as India . But no one can possibly deny that  
\> it has. These forces in themselves are not destructive even if they have led  
\> to some violence and blood-letting. They are essentially beneficent. They  
\> shall seek to heal the splits in the Indian personality so that it is  
\> restored to health and vigour.  
\>  
\> Implicit in the above is the proposition that while India did not cease to  
\> be India either under Muslim or British rule despite all the trials and  
\> tribulations, she was not fully Mother India. And she was not fully Mother  
\> India not because she was called upon to digest external inputs, which is  
\> her nature to assimilate, but because she was not free to throw out what she  
\> could not possibly digest in the normal and natural course, This lack of  
\> freedom to reject what cannot be assimilated is the essence of foreign  
\> conquest and rule. The meaning of Ayodhya is that India has regained, to a  
\> larger extent than hitherto, the capacity to behave and act as a normal  
\> living organism. She has taken another big step towards self-affirmation.  
\>  
\> All truth, as Lenin said, is partisan. So is mine. I do not pretend to be  
\> above the battle, or, to rephrase Pandit Nehru, I am not neutral against  
\> myself. But partisan truth is not demagogy and patently false propaganda,  
\> which is what advocates of ‘composite culture’ have engaged in. Two points  
\> need to be noted in this regard.  
\>  
\> First, no living culture is ever wholly autonomous; for no \*culture\* is an  
\> airtight sealed box; Indian culture, in particular, has been known for its  
\> catholicity and willingness to give as well as take. It withdrew into a  
\> shell when it felt gravely threatened and became rigid; but that is  
\> understandable; indeed, the surprise, if any, is that Indian culture  
\> survived the Islamic and Western onslaught at all.  
\>  
\> Secondly, a culture, if it is not swallowed up by an incoming one, whether  
\> by way of proselytization or conquest or both, as the Egyptians and Iranians  
\> were by Islam, or if it is not destroyed as the Aztec was by the Portuguese  
\> and the Spaniards, must seek to recover; even Indians in Latin America have  
\> not given up the effort. Surely, since no one can possibly suggest that  
\> Indian culture was either swallowed up or destroyed; it is only natural that  
\> it should seek to recover its genuine self. Surely, this is neither an  
\> anti-Islamic nor anti-Western activity.  
\>  
\> Pandit Nehru almost never used the phrase ‘composite culture’. His was a  
\> more organic view of culture and civilization. He believed in, and spoke of,  
\> cultural synthesis which, if at all, could take place only within the old  
\> civilizational framework since Islam did not finally triumph. Pandit Nehru  
\> also wrote and spoke of the spirit of India asserting itself again and  
\> again. Surely, that spirit could not be a composite affair. In the Maulana  
\> Azad memorial lecture (mentioned earlier) he also spoke of different  
\> cultures being products of different environments and he specifically  
\> contrasted tropical India with the deserts of Arabia . He even said that a  
\> Hindu-Muslim cultural synthesis had not been completed when other factors  
\> intervened. Apparently he was referring to the British Raj.  
\>  
\> This should help dispel the impression that the Nehru era was a continuation  
\> of alien rule intended to frustrate the process of Indianization of India.  
\> This charge is not limited to his detractors. It is made by his admirers as  
\> well, though, of course, indirectly and unknowingly. They pit secularism  
\> against Hinduism which is plainly absurd. Hindus do not need the imported  
\> concept of secularism in order to be able to show respect towards other  
\> faiths. That comes naturally to them. For theirs is an inclusive faith which  
\> provides for every form of religious experience and belief; there can be no  
\> heresy or \*kufr\* in Hinduism.  
\>  
\> For Nehru, secularism, both as a personal philosophy and state policy, was  
\> an expression of India’s cultural-civilizational personality and not its  
\> negation and repudi­ation. Secularism suited India’s requirements as he saw  
\> them. For instance, it provided an additional legitimizing principle for  
\> reform movements among Hindus beginning with the Brahmo Samaj in the early  
\> part of the nineteenth century. It met the aspirations of the Westernized  
\> and modernizing intelligentsia. Before independence, it denied legitimacy to  
\> Muslim separatism in the eyes of Hindus, Westernized or traditionalist. If  
\> it did not help forge an instrument capable of resisting effectively the  
\> Muslim League’s demand for partition, the alternative platform of men such  
\> as Veer Savarkar did not avail either. After partition, it served the same  
\> purpose of denying legitimacy to moves to consolidate Muslims as a separate  
\> communalist political force.  
\>

\> Halanta marker is only for the facility of students. Hal is an independent  
\> sound  
\> without a vowel. that is why hal k is diferent from ka. To mark hal is only  
\> to  
\> show that it is independent. In actual pronunciation, ending hal is  
\> pronounced  
\> with a vowel in a number of languages. At the end it is prolonged also. e.g.  
\> kaaaa particularly in music which does not necessarily follow grammar. that  
\> is  
\> why ai and au are not spoken in Hindi and it changes to a mild e and o. It  
\> is  
\> exculsively found in Pali which is a differentiating feature of Pali and  
\> Prakrit. Prakrit preserves both like many Modern Indian languages whereas
