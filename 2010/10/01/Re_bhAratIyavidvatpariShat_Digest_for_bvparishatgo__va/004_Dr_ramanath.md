Dear sadasivamurty rani ji  
Thanks for your very good compliments. I am always reading your  
scholarly posting on various subject and I have great regard for this.  
regarding the subject under discussion I know that your intention is  
not bad and whatever you have stated about creation of our history is  
true and noteworthy. My contention is that in past whatever written  
about our tradition in the form of history that should be restored on  
the basis of textual criticism rather than the statement of any  
particular ideology or thought.However, if you feel that I have hurt  
your sentiment then please do not mind. Regarding the verdict of high  
court- my opinion is that if we will think that there was Babri Masjid  
or Ram Lala temple then there are several places in India, more than  
thousands, which is disputable.Therefore I think that this the topic  
of the debate for political parties not for us.  
  
Let us revisit about the date of Kalidasa. I think that the date of  
kalidasa is prior to Mahabharata on the ground of the depiction of the  
story of Bharata. On the basis of the name Bharata, named as BhArata  
and then Mahabharata. We do not find any kind of sectarianism in  
Kalidasa's literature on the other hand In MahAbhArata we find  
everywhere. There are also linguistic and philosophical base for this  
kind of thought. There are several other sources which indicate the  
same.  
  
Thanks
