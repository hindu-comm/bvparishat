Dear Rani Sadasiva Murty ji  
Jayatu Sanskritam Jayatu Bharatam  
  
Please see or search my all posting to भारतीयविद्वत्परिषत् in this  
regard as time to time I am discussing on the various subject.I have  
not intended you particularly but it is my general suggestion to that  
in these days whatever debate or discussion going on related to  
verdict of High court about Ramjanmbhumi and Babri Masjid is  
politicaly motivated. Therefore we should not indulge in all these.In  
this regard the posting of Prof.S.P. Narang is praiseworthy and we  
should think in that direction.  
  
Thanks with due regard
