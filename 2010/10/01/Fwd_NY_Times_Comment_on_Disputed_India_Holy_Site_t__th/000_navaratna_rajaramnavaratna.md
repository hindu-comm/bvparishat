# Indian Court Divides Disputed Ayodhya Holy Site[Back to Article »](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/01/world/asia/01india.html)

By JIM YARDLEY

A long-awaited decision on control of India’s most disputed religious site splits the land into three portions to be divided among Hindus and Muslims.

Share your thoughts.

This is almost a Judgment of Solomon, but it will not be the final word. It is worth noting that the three judge bench consisted of one Muslim and two Hindus.  
  
Assuming the judgment to stand challenge in the Supreme Court, it is unlikely that a mosque and a temple will both be built at the same site. The best course would be for the Muslims to be offered an alternative site and help to build a mosque of their own in return for the part of the temple site awarded to them. Ayodhya is sacred to the Hindus because of its association with their hero Lord Ram. No such sanctity exists for the Muslims who claim it as a mark of conquest by the Mogul invader Babar.  
  
Such a compromise had been offered by the Hindus decades ago, but Muslim groups rejected it. Had the compromise been accepted, an alternative site and help in place of the Ram temple site held sacred by the Hindus, much bloodshed could have been avoided.  
  
Here is an important lesson for Americans-- the demand for the Islamic Center at ground zero is no different from the mosque built by Babar in 1528 after demolishing a temple. It is mark of conquest and not a place of worship. Americans should learn from this history of Ayodhya of building mosques on sites of destruction.
