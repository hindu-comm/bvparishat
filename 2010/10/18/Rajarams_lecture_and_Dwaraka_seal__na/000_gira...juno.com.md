Respected Scholars, Namaskar!

First I would request Dr.Rajaram to put his lecture complete on bvparishat for benefit of the reader.

If I understood him correctly from his Abstract, he is referring to "Entangled States" Four books-Quantum Gravity, Elegant Universe, Zero point Energy and Entangled State will help interested in understanding of new front in research of physics. A scientist seating in the next to my office in Navy lab in San Diego was working on practical applications of Entangled States-How to detect lock broken on security office instantaneously at the remote place. States are entangles. Thanks. N.R.Joshi

Dear Dr. Kalyanraman, Where could I find the photo of seal used in Dwaraka you described. ? Is it given in Dr. S.R. Rao's book?

There is one more country in Asia which claims to have Golden city buried under their sandy soil. How to handle that? Where is the proof that Yadavas stopped at the west coast of Gujarat and did not go further to the western countries? Has anybody looked in that direction. Research takes into consideration all possibilities. Thanks. N.R.Joshi
