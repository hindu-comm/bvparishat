I think that our scriptures are real science on theoretical basis.If  
modern science is unable to grasp them then it is his fault. The  
absolute form of properties are not visible and visible are not  
cognizable as our sense organs are not capable to grasp the objective  
reality in the essence. Whether it is SAstra or modern scientific  
text, on some extent explain the same, but for modern scientific  
theories are subject to verify as these are made by general people  
rather a Seers(RiSHi). On the other hand The scriptures are revealed  
text so there is no question of any doubt. KAlidAsa wrightly observed  
that "SatAM hi sandehapadeShu VastuShu pramAmaNam antahkaraN  
pravrUtyaH." It means PramAna, proof or authority, is nothing but his  
conscientious ken. So Our old science is real science as it is a  
reveal text. It is duty of a modern scientist that he should try to  
investigate the particular field or subject on his observation.
