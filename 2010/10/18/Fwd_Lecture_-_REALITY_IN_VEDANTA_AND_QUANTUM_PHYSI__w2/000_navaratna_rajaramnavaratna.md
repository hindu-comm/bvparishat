***ABSTRACT***

 The definition of reality is a central issue of modern physics. The wave-particle duality that began with Max Planck and Albert Einstein at the beginning of the twentieth century, evolved into the ‘New Quantum Physics’ of Niels Bohr, Werner Heisenberg and others to the point the very existence of a physical world beyond the experiment and the mathematics came to be denied. This brought about a reaction by Einstein, Schrödinger and others who claimed that quantum mechanics was incomplete as long as it could not be part of an objective reality.

 Physicists chose to ignore such metaphysical questions until Einstein drew attention to the resulting paradox by formulating a conceptual experiment known as the EPR. This suggested that quantum theory violates some fundamental laws of physics like the limit imposed by the velocity of light. This led to a mathematical result by John Stuart Bell that allows experimental study of the various aspects of these theories.

 While these ideas have evolved over the past century as a result of experimental studies, Vedantic philosophers like Shankara and Madhva had examined the same questions of duality and reality from a metaphysical perspective. Madhva even created a science of reality under the name *Tattva-viveka,* in which he suggested that reality has a two-fold existence. This appears to foreshadow the experimental findings that laws of physics may be fundamentally different in the space-time world of relativity and the quantum world of atomic and subatomic particles.

 While not necessarily offering a way out of the current impasse, the Vedantic approach does suggest an alternative way of looking at the pervasive duality and reality puzzle. In particular it forces a reexamination of the quantum postulates and the unsatisfactory state of their metaphysical foundation compared to relativity.

\*\*Speaker Bio\*\*  
Dr. Navaratna S. Rajaram is a mathematical scientist who after more than  
twenty years as an academic and industrial researcher turned his attention  
to history and history of science. He has authored several acclaimed books  
onthe anient worldincluding Sarasvati River and the Vedic Civilization,  
and The Deciphered Indus Script (w/ Natwar Jha). His currentresearch involves  

the use of natural history and genetics to study ancient origins as well as  

using Vedanta tounderstand problems inthe metaphysics of quantum theory.  

He is an adjunct professor of science and philosophy atthe University of Massachusetts  
Center for Indic Studies at Dartmouth, MA.
