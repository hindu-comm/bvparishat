*Meghadūtavyākhyā by Janārdana*



The *Meghadūtavyākhyā by Janārdana* is a valuable, important and useful work, preserved in a singular(*codex-unicum*), complete and a dated Manuscript in the Oriental Institute. Janārdana is a scholar from Gujarat, whose exhaustive comments on the *Meghadūta* are interesting and enlightening on the different aspects like grammar, Alaṅkāras, Flora- Fauna, geography and textual variants. The publication of the said work was a long felt desideratum. Shri Purushottam H. Joshi, Research Officer, Oriental Institute and Prof. Bhagavatprasad P. Pandya, Ex- Research Officer and (lastly) Professor, in the Department of Sanskrit, Pali and Parkrit had taken up this project jointly and had taken great pains in reading minute writings and copying down the entire Manuscript. But with sudden and sad demise of Shri P.H. Joshi in 2002, the work was much lingering. In 2007, Prof. Dr. M. L. Wadekar, Offg. Director, took up the project of completing the remaining work. He, therefore, completely checked it from the original, carefully edited it and prepared the fresh press-copy. He also tried his best to trace out most of the quotations, prepared several appendices and wrote the Introduction on the basis of the material available. This work is now being presented to the world of scholars.

**About the Work**

****

The work *Sādhanamālā* as the title itself suggests, is a compilation of several *Sādhana*s or Buddhist Tantric rituals, composed by different authors. It belongs to little known branch *Vajrayāna* of Buddhism. It was edited by edited by the great scholar of Buddhism and First Director of our Institute Dr. Benoytosh Bhattacharyya, on the basis of eight Manuscripts, collected and collated for the said purposes. The *Sādhana*s, not only prescribes rituals for worshipping the deities, but also prescribes numerous *Mudrā*s. The importance of the work can be understood from the great demand of this book from the scholars world over and its repeated reprints. This work entitled *Sādhanamālā* Vol. I was first published as Gaekwad’s Oriental Series No. XXVI in 1925. It was first reprinted in 1968.The Reprinted volume has again gone out of stock and hence it is now once again reprinted by Modern methods of scanning and printing. The second volume of the *Sādhanamālā* will also be reprinted in near future.
