Respected Scholars, Namaste!

Golden City of The Ancient Arabia

This is research for collecting information and cross-checking. This is not a position paper.

In the ancient history of Arabia, there comes mention of Golden city buried under the sands of Rub al Khali (Empty corner of Arabia). It belonged to the king of the ancient race of Ad people. If anything is very old in Arabia, it is said as old as Ad. There were two Adite civilizations in ancient Arabia, each lasting for 2000 years. Among Arabs there are two types -one Adnan Arabs and other Abrahamic Arabs. This history is not easy to explore because the present Islamic scholars prefer to start from Abraham the Hebrew. The ancestral business of Abraham the Hebrew was cattle grazing. In India we call them Aabheeras. There is phonetic similitude between Aabheera-Aabheeru-Hebrew. Some may not like this connection. All people like to claim that they are descendants of heavenly father or god. Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
