Yes, as Shrisha Rao observes the Indian Instts be it technical or science or humanities don't meet standards of many of European or US instts. However, somewhere we all are also responsible for this situation. The same students/researchers do well when they work in US. DO you think the system developed in india prevents them in achieving the same standards ? Leave the state owned institutions. But, private institutions must change the situation.  
  
These donors can even propose to have Private-public-collaboration model for their stake in educational instts. Quality is conditioned by the quantity of infrastructure, when the researchers/faculty/students are ready to work for quality.
