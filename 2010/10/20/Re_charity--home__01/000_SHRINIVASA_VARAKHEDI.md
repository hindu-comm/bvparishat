I have been contemplating this issue for last one week. I suspect there must be some hidden business agenda / force behind the donation of such a huge amount. These people were never so generous in Indian context. And interestingly getting everything including education from Indian soil, these so called high profile philanthropists exhibited their interests.  
  
Interestingly the donated amount is again coming to India through subcontracts given to various agencies.  
  
warm regards,
