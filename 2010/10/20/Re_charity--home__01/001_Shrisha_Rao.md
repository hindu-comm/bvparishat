\> I have been contemplating this issue for last one week. I suspect there must be some hidden business agenda / force behind the donation of such a huge amount. These people were never so generous in Indian context. And interestingly getting everything including education from Indian soil, these so called high profile philanthropists exhibited their interests.

It certainly is a bit discomfiting that these philanthropists see fit to give large donations abroad, more so than at home, but I personally see this as more a comment on the quality of educational institutions at home vis-à-vis those abroad, and much less as an issue concerning the character of the donors.

Let's face it: most of our institutions are not comparable with the best in the world, and are indeed often mired in politics, personality cults, and other drawbacks. They do not deserve charity on the same scale. We like to think that our society values education, but it really only values money, with the former being seen only as a means of gaining wealth, not an end in itself. Not only in the arts and humanities, but even in technical disciplines, most students and even members of the faculty are least interested in genuine learning. In this regard, I for one am very pro-Semitic; the Jewish culture is far superior in this regard, as Jews as a rule value education far more than our people, with results that are for all to see. (Compare the quality of the research institutions in Israel with what we have in India, and the number of winners of Nobel Prizes and other prestigious international awards in the Jewish state vs. in India).

\> Recently two items signalled an increasing trend in Indian philanthropy: investment in institutions of higher education abroad. Ratan Tata announced a $50 million gift to Harvard Business School and Anand Mahindra has provided $10 million to a humanities centre, which follows Narayana Murthy’s $5 million gift to Harvard for the Clay Sanskrit Library. Recently, several American universities have been the beneficiaries of Indian philanthropy: Cornell, Penn, Stanford, Yale, just to name a few, have been the beneficiaries of Indian largesse, as have several American think-tanks. The scale of these donations is staggering. What does it portend?
