 Like scholars from Tamil Nadu on Dravidians, USSR (and Russian) scholars' pronouncements on the Aryans should be taken with a large pinch of salt. They seem to represent nationalistic aspirations rather than reality-- the same as with 19th century Germany.



 It is curious how Russians seem to look to the Germans for leadership in everything, going back to the time of Peter the Great.



 Please read *Aryan Idols* by Stefan Arvidsson.
