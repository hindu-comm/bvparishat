I do not know whether Joshiji counts himself and Sri Rajaram among  
Indian scholars. You may see any book by Greek/Roman authors of past  
about India-all have stated specifically that India is only country  
where no body has come from outside. They have stated attack on India  
by Dionysus in 6777 BC and glacial floods in 9564 BC, but unaware  
about any migration into India by 'Vedic Aryans' in 1500 BC. Books of  
Herodotus, Pliny, Solinus, Megasthenes, Arrian etc are available of
