Dear Scholars  
Jayatu Bharatam Jayatu SamskRutaM  
  
I have gone through the discussion on the issue in question. For the  
origin of language, no one claim that this is the starting point of  
the origin of Sanskrit. However, various causes of the origin of the  
languages might be interpreted. In ancient Indian tradition (almost  
all Buddhist to Jain except CArvAk)word and meaning both are non-  
distinct, regardless to this that they admit the word as a pramANa or  
not, as for them the distinction between these two is not possible or  
visible. Reason is that absolute form of the properties are not  
visible and visible is only illusion, guNAnAm paramam RUpam na dRuShTi  
patham AyAti, SAmkhya). The words of all our seers such as  
PAnini,Katyayana, Patanjali, Gautam, KaNAda, Jaimini, Buddha, MahAvira  
etc.are eternal so their texts are revealed text. Their text is of  
course subject to test but in our practical life . If their words are  
not appropriate in our practical life then it is our fault not theirs.  
This is so because according to them object and subject both are non-  
distinct, if we have any objective only then we will proceed further  
to achieve that and gets the result otherwise not.  
  
The term cow indicates a form as well as all substantive such as  
nAma, dravya, guNa, kriyA etc..In this case the meaning of a  
particular word is not cognizable.So the,word and meaning and their  
relation (sambandha) are eternal(nitya or siddha). Thus, according to  
Sanskrit Grammar in PANinian tradition, KAtyAyana and Patanjali,  
word, meaning, sambandha, nitya and siddha all are eternal. So In  
PAninian grammar the semantic study is not in the same form as we see  
in western linguistic.  
  
According to Sanskrit Grammarian, the form(AkRuti)i.e. attribute and  
dravya (sabstantive)both are the padArtha, meaning of the sentence is  
only for conventional usage and comes in the form of language with  
intention. But in reality the word and their meanings are non-  
distinct. This is applicable for both Vedic as well as classical.  
vAgarthAviva sampruktau, pratipatti, meaning depends on the intention  
of the speaker so the objective is the main cause of the sentence  
neither verbal root, activities expressed by it nor any agent rather  
these are indirectly cause in expounding of the sense. Therefore the  
meaning of a kriyA is pAcakaH or yAjakaH, not the yaj or pac. For  
MimAnsakas the main object is the pronouncian of the word not the  
meaning.  
  
For example see MahAbhAsya- kiM punarAkRutiH padArtha Ahosvit dravyam.  
ubhamityAha. kathaM jnyAyate. ubhayathA hyAcAryyena sUtrANi pathitAni.  
AkRuti padArthaM matvA jAtyAkhyaayaamekasminbahuvacanamanyatarasyaam  
ityucyate. dravyaM padArthaM matvA sarUpANaam ityekaSeSha Arabhyate.  
The main point here to be noted that language is only for  
conventional usage not to indicate the reality of the thing or the  
reality of the worldly affairs or the absolute like god, or Atman.  
Thus whatever we percieves and then express is only metaphoricaaly not  
real. I do not want to comment on The Book of Ramvilas Sharma as I  
have gone through at the time of my Ph.d theses but with due regard to  
him, I must say that I am not agree with him on almost points.  
  
  
Thanks  
with due regard  
Ramanath
