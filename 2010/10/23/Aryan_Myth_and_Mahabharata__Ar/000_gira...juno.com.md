Respected Scholars!

Thanks Dr. N.Rajaram for posting Stephan Arvidsson article. Last line ,"While this accounts for the  
European attachment to the Aryan myth, it fails to explain why many Indian scholars continue to cling to it. The answer will have to come from an Indian scholar."

This is also written by Dr, Trautmann of University of Michigan few years ago.

I may be wrong but this is my understanding. Some Indian scholars stick to this outdated theory because they are afraid to get stamped as VHP, BJP or RSS. Associating with foreign scholars brings (in their opinion-not mine-I got all honors in my engineering profession in USA) prestige. Indians look down on Indians. This is publicly discussed by Dr. Malhotra in WAVES conference.

In one conference I presented paper on "Tough Steel of Ancient India" I offered etymology of the word "Polad". From the audience one brother got up and said you are BJP. After my presentation, I showed him the book of a German archaeologist. He saw it and turned his back and left without saying thanks. Change will come in India when the west drops the theory or Aryan Myth from their textbooks.

But that does not solve problem for India-If Sanskrit did not come from PIE, then where did it come from? Dr, Marcantonio of Italy discussed Proto Indo-European. She took help of Grimm, Vernon rules. She questions PIE but if not PIE, then what? If not Aryan invasion then what? One has to explain who were in countries next to India when Mahabharat war was fought in the subcontinent? Why some of the states described in Mahabharata are found outside of the subcontinent? Why Mahabharat dynasties are also found outside of the subcontinent? Who were Sarpas killed by Janamejaya? Were they human beings or snakes from India or from outside? If from outside, where from? Takshaka went hiding behind Indra. Then where was Indra? On earth or floating in the air? Where exactly was the place of Sarpayaaga-Hastinapura? Where was it? Who built the floating city of Mahabharata? Indians or outsiders.

I said earlier- Origin of Sanskrit (Semantics of words of Sanskrit-not grammar) and Mahabharat history are two unsolved problems. Both are interesting. Thanks. N.R.Joshi
