 I am inclined to agree with Sri Bhagwan Singh that the Hindu organizations, not just RSS are not active in really important intellectual areas. I am now in the Boston area for lectures on topics related to Vedanta. I may also offer a course on **'Vedanta in today's world'** next year. Hindu organizations are nowhere in the picture. Vedanta must be brought to today's world if our tradition is to remain vital.



 But Hindus seem to be engaged in an effort to take us back into an imaginary utopian past with excessive religiosity. In the process they are losing the future generations which view their obsessive religiosity and religion as a form of obscurantism.



 I look at Vedanta the same way I look at mathematics-- it is a logical system that must be adapted to different situations. My present work tries to use it to shed light on quantum metaphysics. I don't know how successful I will be, but it is worth trying. I am giving a talk on the subject this afternoon at MIT.



 Bhagwan Singh's or anyone else's left or right inclinations are irrelevant in my approach.
