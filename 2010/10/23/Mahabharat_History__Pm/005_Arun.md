Texts need to be consulted with practical constructions and usage.  
There are 2 structures at Kutub-minar site. The Minar proper has the  
same foundation as that of 27 temples in circle around it-they may  
correspond to 27 nakshatras. No ancient or modern architecture can use  
ancient foundation for a new high Minar. For architecture purpose,the  
load of temples around it formed stabilizing load for tilted Minar,  
which is inclined at about 5 degree south and was meant to be  
perpendicular on karka-rekha (Tropic of cancer in 456 BC-start of  
SriHarsha Shaka-indicated by Al-Biruni and Abul fazal). The Minar  
proper is at the sight which is northernmost position of moon on earth  
surface-it was about 28.9 degree in 456 BC. The adjacent iron pillar  
has inscription of 'Chandra' only which is related to moon's extreme  
position. Too much meaning has been extracted from this single word-it  
is assumed to be Chandragupta-2 as obvious conclusion. Even if Chandra  
is assumed to be Chandragupta, it can mean at least 3 famous  
Chandraguptas-one was founder of Maurya dynasty and 2 were in Gupta  
dynasty. There could be a Chandragupta of lesser fame having capital  
at Delhi. None of the famous 3 Chandraguptas was based at Delhi. Ibn-  
Batuta also had written that Kutub Minar was constructed about 1500  
years before him (or before Kutub-ud-Din Aibak in 1206-1210 AD). The  
Minar whose foundation was laid in 1199 AD is adjacent to Kutub Minar  
and is of about double dimeter and half constructed or partly  
collapsed during construction. It is obviously on different  
foundation.  
In a way, even Megasthenes had written about it. He has stated that  
Palibothri on banks of Yamuna was one of main towns of Hercules. It  
has been assumed to be Patna without any basis. Hercules like Vishnu  
has 2 meanings-Vishnu or Vaman and his incarnations, sun which holds  
earth in its gravitation.  
In sense of sun, town of Hercules means pillar for measuring latitude  
etc or mark of a time zone. Pillars of Hercules were at 90 degree west  
of Ujjain called Romaka-pattana in Surya-siddhanta. So, the town of  
Hercules here may mean this pillar only like pillars near Rabat in  
Morocco.  
Jain Text Surya-prajnapti indicates dimensions of Meru of which it is  
a model. Its semi-vertical angle indicates the difference between mean  
and true latitude at Delhi. (See Jain Astronomy by sajjan Singh Lishk  
or my commentary on Siddhanta-darpana, chapter 16). Surprisingly, no  
other text after Mahabharata till 1850 AD anywhere in world talks  
about true latitude-all have assumed perfect spherical shape of earth.  
On basis of certain signs on it, Sir Saiyad Ahmed (founder of Aligarh  
Muslim University) in 1911 wrote a book of 300 pages telling that  
Kutub Minar is a much older Hindu structure and should not be called  
an Islamic monument.  
Sri Korada has given all references for Kutupa. It means a vessel in  
conical shape for pouring oil in pointed flow. In Triprashnadhikara of  
Surya-siddhanta and all other texts of astronomy, method has been  
given for finding north-south direction. It is same as Method of  
traversing described in text-books of surveying for M.Tech (civil).  
Shadow end of any vertical pole (called Shanku) moves in shape of  
Kutupa between 11 AM and 1 Pm or any interval equally spaced around  
local noon. That is bisected by common part of two circles drawn from  
two ends of that Kutupa. That part common to 2 circles in called Mina  
(fish) due to its shape. The Kutupa shaped locus of shadow end is  
bisected by Mina, so the device is Kutupa (b)-Minar. For same purpose  
magnetic compass was used- which is called Kutub-numa, i.e doing work  
similar to Kutub-minar-Arun Kumar Upadhyay, 09437034172
