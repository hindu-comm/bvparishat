namo vidvdbhyah

sorry for the inconvenience

Is it 'kutapa' or 'kutupa' or both ? - both are there .

Jyotisam, DharmasAstram , Vyakaranam and Markandeyapuranam --

1.kutapah : Amarah(2-Brahmavargah) - amso'stamo'hnah kutapo'striyAm .  
kum prthivIm (gotrA kuh prthivI prthvI - Amarah 2) sUryah tapati iti  
kutapah - yogarUdhah .

When should one perform SrAddhakarma ?

Devide the daytime into fifteen parts and the eighth part is called  
'kutapa' and it runs for two ghatikas .

Smrtih - raudrassvetasca maitrasca tathA sArabhatassmrtah I  
 sAvitro vijayascaiva gAndharvah kutapastatha II  
 rauhineyo virincasca somo'tha nirrtistathA I  
 mAhendro varunascaiva bhatah pancadasassmrtah II

 kum yatra gopatirgobhih kartsnyena tapati ksane I  
 sa kalah kutapo nAma sraddham tatra pradIyate II

Manusmrtih (3-234,235) -  
 vratasthamapi dauhitram srAddhe yatnena bhojayet I  
 kutapamcAsane dadyAt tilaisca vikirenmahIm II  
 trIni srAddhe pavitrAni dauhitrah kutapastilAh I  
       trIni cAtra prasamsanti saucamakrodhamatvarAm II

KullUkabhatta comments - kutapa is naipAlI kambalah (Hindi commentator also) .

KamalAkarabhatta of Nirnayasindhu (Telugu script by VAvilla  
RAmasvAmisAstrulu ,ChennapurI, 1906 , 1986) under (3rd AdhyAya) '  
SrAddhe jalanirnaya' quotes from

MatsyapurAnam -

madhyAhnah khadgapAtram ca tathA nepAlakambalah I  
raupyam tilA gAvo dauhitrascAstamah smrtah II  
pApam kutsitamityAhuh tasya samtApakArinah I  
astAvete yatastasmAt kutupA iti visrutAh II

BrahmapurAnam -

yatistridandah karunA rAjatam pAtrameva ca I  
dauhitram kutupah kAlah chAgah krsnAjinam tathA II (sastAni iti sesah)

Smrtisamgrahe -

ucchistam sivanirmAlyam vAntam ca mrtakarpatam I  
srAddhe sapta pavitrAni dauhitrah kutupastilAh II

2.kutupah (Amarah 2- Vaisyavargah) -

kutUh krttisnehapAtre saivAlpA kutupah pumAn - a leather container  
for oil - the big one is  
'kutUh' and small one is 'kutupah' .

Here , following Panini ( there is no any DhAtu such as 'tupa' ) and  
Amarasimha , we can /  
have to decide that - 'kutapa' is for kAla (etc) and 'kutupa' is for  
small leather container for oil  
(during ancient times ) .

The word ' kuh ' has got the meaning 'pApam' also - 'pApakutsesadarthe  
ku' (Amara - 3- nAnArthAvyayavargah) .

Therefore , in the sense of 'kutapakAla' it is ' kum prthivIm tapati'  
and for the rest it will be  
'kum papam tapati' .

The wrong usage is due to lack of knowledge of VyAkaranam and / or Kosa .

In KullUkabhatta's commentary , in light of the available material  
from PurAnas and Smrtis, the  
term ' naipAlI kambalah' is upalaksanam ( etc.) .

For Telugu people -- in Manucaritra (SvArocisamanusambhavam)one of the  
PancamahAkAvyas of Telugu , the author AllasAni PeddanArya (1500 AD)  
use the term 'kutapakAla' in the context of PravarAkhya's journey  
with PAdalepa offered by Siddha .

Here the commentators , it seems , got confused and did/could not  
decide the meaning of the  
term . The author of the PIthika , the famous scholar , Sree VemparAla  
SUryanArAyanasAstrI,  
also did not explain the term . In fact, it is there neither in  
VyAsa's MArkandeyapurAna nor  
in MArarana's Telugu Translation . The poet meant roughly midday -  
between 11.30 and 12.30 .
