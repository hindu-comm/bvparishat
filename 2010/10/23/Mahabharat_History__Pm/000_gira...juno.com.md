Respected Scholars, Namaskar!

Meru Parvata and Gandhamaadana Parvata  
Names of these two mountains appear often in the epic Mahabharata. Are these peaks of Himalayas. Himalaya has many peaks and Himalaya spreads from Eastern Burma to Afghanistan. Where exactly these peaks are. What is the position of Meru-east of Gandamaadan or west of Gandamaadan. What are the positions of Kraunca dweepa and Shaakala dweepa with respect to Meru parvata? Where is the Shalmali dweepa with respect to Indian subcontinent? Thanks. N.R.Joshi .
