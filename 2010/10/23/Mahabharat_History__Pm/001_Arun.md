Meru-  
Basically this is meant to be rotation axis of earth. Its length is  
100,000 yojanas ( 1 yojana = 1000 part of equatorial diameter = 12800  
kms approx. here). The disc shaped zone around earth in plane of  
ecliptic is called Jambu-dvipa of 50, 000 yojana radius in Bhagavata  
purana, skandha 5, Vishnu purana 2/7-8 etc. That is exclusive  
gravitational zone of earth in which a body will revolve round earth.  
Moon is at about 61r distance, r = radius of earth.  
Vishnu purana 2/8 tells about Shishumara-chakra which is perpendicular  
to ecliptic plane around which earth’s axis rotates in 26000 years,  
called precession of equinoxes (also explained by Al-Biruni). This has  
been called Naka-svarga in Vedas (Madhusudan Ojha-Brahma-siddhanta  
etc.). Axis of solar system and galaxy (Parameshthi mandala) have been  
called Lingas in space in Shiva-purana.  
Kutub-minar is model of Sumeru of earth in space. At Delhi, its semi-  
vertical angle is equal to difference between true and mean latitude  
there. That was not known after Mahabharata till 1850 AD. In 456 BC at  
start of Sri-Harsha shaka (Al-Biruni, Abul Fazal), it was place of  
northern most position of moon on earth surface (inclination of  
earth’s axis 23.90 + inclination of moon’s orbit with ecliptic 5.020)-  
Refer my commentary on Siddhanta-Darpana, chapter 16. So, ‘Chandra’  
has been written on iron pillar there. A pillar of 12 units (called  
Shiva-linga of 12 angula in Shiva purana) was used to measure time and  
latitude of a place. It is called Shanku in surya-siddhanta etc.  
Smallest shadow is at noon time and locus of shadow end around that  
time is in shape of a ‘Kutup’ called kuppi (funnel, thistle-kip) in  
Hindi. So, the muhurtta at noon time is called Kutupa-muhurtta. By  
bisecting the shadow line equi-spaced from noon, say at 11 and 13 hrs-  
we get north–south direction. This is explained as traversing in books  
of astronomical survey for M.Tech (civil). The bisection is by common  
part of two circles in shape of a ’Mina’ (fish), so the pillar is  
called Kutup-Mina or Kutub-minar. Magnetic compass does almost same  
work, so it is called Kutub-numa. In that also, needle floating on  
mercury is called ‘Mina’. Local references of latitude also have been  
given name of fish like Rohataka ( almost at longitude of Ujjain) and  
Hilsa near Patna (100 east of Ujjain).  
Mapping of earth surface of north (and south) hemisphere was in 4  
sheets of 900 longitude width. It was centered round north pole called  
Meru or Sumeru. Bharata-varsha (India) has been called one of the 4  
petals of that lotus (earth surface) as it roughly extends 450 west  
and 450 east of Ujjain. Thus, Meru has 4 faces and its linga (symbol)  
has square base-called Svayambhu linga as in Kaaba of Arab at west end  
of Bharata. Pyramids were constructed 450 and 1800 west of Ujjain in  
Ezypt and at Mexico (called Siddhapura in Surya siddhanta)-Valmiki  
Ramayana, Kishkindha kanda (40/54, 64).  
South pole was called Kumeru (opposite to Sumeru in north).  
Aryabhata (Kali 360 = 2742 BC) has stated that north pole is in water  
and south pole on land mass. South pole is joint of 2 land masses-  
called Yama-dvipa. Yama is lord of south and Yama also means twin or  
double.Till 1985, it was not confirmed whether south pole is in water  
channel between 2 land masses or on land itself. Only by echo-  
sounding, in 1985, it was known that it is actually on land. Nearest  
land mass is New Zealand which has again 2 islands. So it was called  
Yama-koti-Dvipa (at end of Yama dvipa). Actually, Yama star (southern  
Crux) has same southern latitude as this island. Its south western tip  
has been called Yama-koti-pattana (port of Yama-koti)-stated to be 900  
east of Ujjain in Surya-siddhanta etc. There should be a pyramid at  
this point also-probably it is submerged in ocean now.  
Largest land mass is Jambu-dvipa (Asia + Europe). Center of  
mountain ranges is called Pran-Meru (Eastern Meru) or Pamir. Human  
Brahma was here at Pushkara (120 west of Ujjain and 350 north where  
maximum day length is of 16 hours). This is now called Bukhara on  
north of ancient Persia, now in Uzbekistan. 4 highways went in 4  
directions, so Brahma was called 4 faced. Till today convention of  
script by him continues- north east part writes from up to down, south  
west to left and south east (India) to right side. North west part  
uses Sankhya script of 52 letters-see my article ‘Vedic origin and  
classification of scripts’ on [www.scribd.com/Arunupadhyay](http://www.scribd.com/Arunupadhyay). Opposite to  
that is Pushkara-dvipa (south America) having Apara-Meru (western  
Meru) at Peru from where 4 highways emanated in 4 directions from  
Kuzco as in Pran-meru.  
In between is central Meru at equator in Kenya (mount Kilimanjaro).  
Sri Vinay Jha used it for the first time for rain forecasting as it  
starts from equator region only and reached India as rains after  
Adhana (in womb) period of 6.5 months (193 days) as in Brihat-samhita  
of Varahamihira. The places around it have still the name of Meru.  
(see website of Sri Vinay Jha).
