Respected Scholars, Namaskar!

I apologize for being lazy not to tag my postings.

I will be in India from April 8 to June end. I may visit Hyderabad and will try to collect nectar of Sanskrit knowledge from scholars like Dr. S. Korad, Dr Varakhedi and others. In the past I had contact with Osmania University. We all had wonderful discussions on different aspects of Sanskrit in 2009 and 2010. Thanks. N.R.Joshi
