Dear Dr. Jha,  
I sent an e-mail in reply to your reminding the last date for submission  
of papers and requested you to send an abstract of my paper to be  
presented in 4i-SCLS since I was too busy to prepare a full paper. I am  
yet to get any response from you. Pl. let me know  
whether the abstract followed by the full paper may still be sent.  
Looking forward to your early reply, and with warm wishes,

Nabanarayan Bandyopadhyay  
Prof. & Director  
School of Vedic Studies, RBU, Kolkata
