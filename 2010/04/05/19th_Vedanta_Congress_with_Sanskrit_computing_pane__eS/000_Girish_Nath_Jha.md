Dear members

The 19th Vedanta Congress is being organized by the Center for Indic Studies, University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth by Prof Bal Ram Singh, director of the Center of Indic Studues. The website for the conference is <http://www.umassd.edu/indic/nineteenth_vedanta_conference_call_for_paper.cf>

There are several areas under the broad theme of the congress which may interest you. In addition, there is a panel on Text Encoding and Search for Sanskrit (TESS) which seeks to explore issues like encoding mechanisms, standards, data storage, cross platform portability & exchange leading to effective interlinked search for the texts of Vedic tradition.

If you are interested, then send your abstracts to Prof Bal ram Singh at [bsi...@umassd.edu]()

  
warm regards
