Dear Colleagues,  
The word 'nyaaya' denotes both a five-membered syllogism and the system of philosophical logic propounded by Akshapaada Gautama.The Praaciina-nyaaya, whether in the sutra-commentary tradition or in the manuals,is devoted to epistemology and metaphysics both,although it is basically Pramaanashaastra in the tradition.The Navya-nyaaya coming up with authors like Shashadhara,Manikantha and finally Gangesha who gave it a definitive shape,is more devoted to epistemology and logic and the metaphysical discussions are subsumed thereunder.This is how the Tattvacintaamani of Gangesha has four chapters delineating the four distinct pramaanas.The language of navya-nyaaya is extremely logical and is aimed at immaculate precision free from ambiguity.Thus it served as vehicle to discuss philosophical issues in the Sanskrit shastraic tradition four the last seven centuries continuing upto the present times.  
With regards,
