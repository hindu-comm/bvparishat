Dear Scholars,  
Can you please suggest a book which details all the important Nyayas (like *hatashvadagdharatha, dehalidipa, ghattakutiprabhara etc)* that we find in the Sanskrit literature. A few important ones are listed in Apte dictionary...but they are only a few.  
I am aware that G.A Jacob has written a book (or three volumes) on Handful of Popular Maxims Current in Sanskrit Literature and was published by Nirnaya Sagar Press. But not sure were to get this book from.  
Advayananda
