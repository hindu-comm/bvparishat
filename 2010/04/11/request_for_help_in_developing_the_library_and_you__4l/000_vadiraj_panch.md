Dear Professors/Sanskrit Scholars,

I am writing this letter again, since I felt that my earlier letter has not reached many or might have gone into the scam folder, by mistake!!

I would appreciate if you would kindly send your response to this and to my other letter, seeking your Sanskrit articles for our monthly Sanskrit Journal, entitled, Sri Gurusarvabhouma.  

I am writing this for a specific purpose.



I am pleased to inform you that I have now been designated as Chancellor (Kuladhipati) of a Sanskrit Vidyapeeth, named Sri Guru Sarvabhouma Sanskrit Vidypaeeth, at Mantralayam. This Vidyapeeth is an oriental institution which is about hundred years old and which is dedicated to the cause of fosteringthe learning in Sanskrit and Indology. It is located at the most sacred place, called Mantralayam, where the shrine of a great Saint Philosopher of 15^(th)-16th Century A.D, viz. Sri Raghawendra Tirtha, is located. Sri Raghawendra Tirtha has authored, in Sanskrit, more than 50 philosophical works of great intellectual value, which are admired by the scholars in the field.



Recently, Mantralayam was under the devastating floods of Tungabhadra river. Many books and rare works of Sanskrit of our Vidyapeeth, have been, either washed away or greatly damaged. Though efforts have been made to restore many of the damaged books, this has been a very great loss to our Vidyapeeth.

I have now taken up the task of rebuilding the library. I have also launched some initiatives to streamline the functioning of the Vidyapeeth, with the objective of raising its stature and standards. I would need valuable help from well wishers like yourself.



My specific request is as follows;

** **

**I would request you kindly to send all the past publications of your Institution or your personal publications, or your personal collections, or those, which you could donate,to our Vidyapeeth in Mantralayam, on a complimentary basis. I would also request you kindly to place our Vidyapeeth on the mailing list of your university, for all future publications.**

** **

**We would like to have complete Set of all the Shastra Granthas, Purana Granthas and Sahitya Granthas available, through your University** , or through your personal collections 

I would like to propose that we could place our Institutions on the arrangement of mutual exchange of publications, for all future publications.

I am also enclosing herewith a list of our past publications, (to be sent separately)for which copies are available in our stock. We would be happy to send our publications, on complimentary basis if you indicate your selections.



The address of the Mantralayam Vidyapeeth is given above. Books can be sent by rail to Mantralayam Road station. 

I would feel very happy if you kindly give your consent to my request.

I would also like to invite you to visit Mantralayam and deliver a lecture on the topic of your choice and also to give me your valuable suggestions for improving the usefulness of the Vidyapeeth, to the students and teachers of Sanskrit and Philosophy.

I hope to hear from you at your earliest.

Thanking you in anticipation and with warm regards,





Yours Sincerely

Yours Sincerely



V.R.Panchamukhi
