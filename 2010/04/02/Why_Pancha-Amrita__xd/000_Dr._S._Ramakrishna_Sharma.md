**Namaste.  
Food/fruits for total transformation at the physical level  
appears to be a new idea/concept, though it is not.  
The Abhishekam of five items to Sacred Lingam,   
Saligrama and Idols of different metals need to be   
studied and experimented with Shraddha and Bhakti.  
  
There are many sacred centres in Bharatam where miraculous  
things keep happening even today. For example, the Shiva Lingam  
near Hassan District of Karnataka where Ghee gets converted  
to Butter after Abhishekam!  
  
This ought to be videoed. The attached file narrates how  
food/fruits for total transformation at the physical level  
work.  
  
Pranams.
