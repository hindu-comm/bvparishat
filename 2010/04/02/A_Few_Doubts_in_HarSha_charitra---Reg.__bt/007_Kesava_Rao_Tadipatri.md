Dear Sri Sadasiva Murty garu,



 Thank you very much. I also don't like to grope around looking for the

libraries for specialized books. I have a reasonable size collection

and like to add to the collection to quench my thirst. So, I am looking for

some specialized book stores.



I know a couple like Vedanta book house , and Purna Prajna

Vidyapithain Bangalore.



I saw thru online search [flipkart.com](http://flipkart.com) in

Koramangala,  
Bangalore - 560034



Are there other specialized book stores either in Andhra

or Karnataka or Tamilnadu (or other parts of India), wherefrom

I can purchase the books?
