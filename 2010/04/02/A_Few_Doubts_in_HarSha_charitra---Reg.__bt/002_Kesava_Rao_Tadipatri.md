Namaskaras to the sabha.



That is very useful information. Just like to make couple

of clarifications. Pls see if that is true. Also, I have

a small question at the end.



1\. I am not sure what is meant by 'immediately after the first letter'.

That may seem like second letter. But why would gaNa be told for the second

letter? "nAdyAnnasau syAtAM" - AdyAt na nasau syAtAM - From the first,

'na', 'sa' gaNas should not be there - meaning the first gaNa should not

be na or sa. This implies thatit should not start with two laghus.

First gaNa can be ya, ma, ta, ra, ja, bha.

Similarly instead of "after fourth", it should be "starting from fourth".

That is the second GaNa should be ya gaNa. Seventh and eigth letters can be

any thing.



2\. Aparavaktra is ardhasama Vrtta. Here specific Ganas are mentioned for

odd lines and even lines. VaitAlIya class (jAti) is more generalistic

in nature and Aparavaktra is one type of vaitAlIya. There are hundreds

of possible vaitAlIya types.



"shaDviShame.aShTau same kalAs-

tAshcha same syurnirantarAH

na samAtra parAshritA phalA

vaitAliye.ante ralau guruH"



The first and third lines will contain 6 mAtras and then ra, la, ga

(making a total of 14 mAtras).



The second and fourth lines will contain 8 mAtras and then ra, la, ga

(making a total of 16 mAtras).



Now aparavaktra has -



first and third lines as - na, na, ra, la, ga (na, na is six mAtrAs)



second and fourth lines as - na, ja, ja, ra, which can also be

written as - na, ja, la, ra, la, ga (na, ja, la is eight mAtrAs).



So, aparavajtra is one type of vaitAlIya.



Can someone please give the name of the chandas that has -



na-ja-ja-ja-ja-la-ga (17 letters) in each pAda



(This is that famous Mahishasura mardini stotra)

Kesava Rao Tadipatri
