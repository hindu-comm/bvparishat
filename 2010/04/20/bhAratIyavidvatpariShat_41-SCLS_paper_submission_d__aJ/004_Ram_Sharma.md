My dear Himabindu Ji,

 I consider Tirupati Vidyapeetham as my Vidyapeetham.So I cannot ignore any serious Student of my Vidyapeetham.Like you I too am
very alpajna of SamgaNakayantra.But if you can or if someone from administration could help you ,one Mr Les Morgan in California ,USA (phone no 00 1 415 863 3045)may be contacted.He is helping me in my Mahabharata Project electronically.He will be able to answer all your questions about Tagger Output.Please remember that there is is a time difference of 12.30 hours .If Tirupati time is 12.30 pm Monday
California time would be 1am monday (officially speaking)our Sunday night.

 Kindly convey my regards to hn'ble Kulapati Ji and other esteemed colleagues,

 Presently I am teaching at Univ. of Pennsylvania.I have already spoken to Mr Les Morgan about your query.

 All the best,

 Ram Karan sharma
