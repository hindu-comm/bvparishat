Dear all,  
Hari Om  
  
The following is a rare opportunity for students of Sanskrit and Computational Linguistics.  
  
Chinmaya International Foundation Shodha Samsthan in collaboration with the Department of Sanskrit Studies, University of Hyderabad, is happy to welcome you for a one week workshop on 'Developing Sanskrit Karaka Analyser' from 11th May to 16th May 2010.  
  
This workshop aims to bridge Sanskrit tradition with modern computational technology in the field of Natural Language Processing. It is envisaged that at the end of the Workshop, the challenges that are faced in developing tools for Sanskrit Computational Linguistics will be identified and solutions and guidelines for the solving the same will be evolved.  
  
Apart from computer skills, participants are required to have a little bit of knowledge of Sanskrit Grammar. A part of the workshop time will be spent in studying the Karaka Prakarana of the Ashtadhyayi with the Mahabhashya. Shabdabodya Prikriya will also be discussed. Steps will be initiated for designing the Karaka Analyser.  
  
Topics such as Machine Translation Architecture, Karaka tagging scheme will be given special impetus.  
  
Eminent scholars in the field of Sanskrit Computational Linguistics like Prof. K. V. Ramakrishnamacaryulu, Prof. Amba Kulkarni, Dr. Shrinivasa Varakhedi and so on will be the faculty for the workshop.  
  
Scholars and students from Sanskrit and IT fields are welcome to join. Accommodation will be provided; you will have to bear the travel expenses

अथ चेत्त्वमिमं धर्म्यं संग्रामं न करिष्यसि।  
ततः स्वधर्मं कीर्तिं च हित्वा पापमवाप्स्यसि।।  
तस्मादुत्तिष्ठ कौन्तेय युद्धाय कृतनिश्चयः।  
निराशीर्निर्ममो भूत्वा युध्यस्व विगतज्वरः।। (भ.गी.)
