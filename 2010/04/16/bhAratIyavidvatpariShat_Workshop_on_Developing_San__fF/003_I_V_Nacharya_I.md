Respected Madam,

praNamyA. Though I am aged 79 years old I am interested in the proposed work-Shop and I want to attend it along with a good scholar friend whom I am yet to contact and encourage shortly after his return from Haridwar.Accommodation may kindly be reserved for two scholars.

With Regards,

I.V.Nacharya.[ivi...@yahoo.co.in]()
