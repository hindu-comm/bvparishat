Dear all,

I am deeply grieved to learn about the sad demise of the veteran Sanskrit Scholar, Sri Ramaranjan Mukherjee  
Professor Mukherjee was always full of enthusiasm and positive vibrations for the cause of Sanskrit and Indology. His speeches were full of new thoughts. I wish some body brings out a collection of all his inspiring speeches.

His sad demise is a great unfillable loss to the Sanskrit world. To me it is a big personal loss. I had had the privilege of succeeding him as Chancellor at Rshtriya Sanskrit University at Tirupati. During my two terms of ten years as Chancellor, I had had very cordial and inspiring association with him. Suchexperiences are rather rare! He was always coming out withfull- throated appreciation from heart for all my good deeds for the development of the Vidyapeeth.

Both Dr. Ramaranjan Mukherjee and Smt Mukherjee have been great noble souls. I could imagine the great grief which life time partner could feel on this occasion. We can only offer our assurances for making Prof. Mukherjee's memory remain alive in the intellectual word and ourwords of condolences to Smt. Mukherjee and the bereaved family.

I would like to convey my sincere feelings of condolences to the bereaved familyof the Sanskrit world. I pray that the departed soul rests in peace.

I am writing this though in a belated manner. I had conveyed my condolences and prayers, mentally long time back. I had not been able to write it out.

Thanks and regards

Yours Sincerely



V.R.Panchamukhi

Dear Dr Bandyopadhyaya,  
  
Professor Ramaranjan Mukherji in leaving his mortal coil has left a  
void which is difficult to fill up.The world of Sanskrit and Indology  
will gratefully remember him as one who built, stabilized and  
academically enriched institutions of Bhaaratiiya Vidyaa in it's  
various aspects.As an Academician,an Administrator and above all a Man  
he was precious and rare,his presence lent a definite respectability  
to Sanskrit studies in the whole country and abroad.  
  
Recently he had agreed to deliver the Prof.G.Bhattacharya Memorial  
Lectures for the year 2009 in Kurukshetra University,but had postponed  
it due to his wife's health after which he himself had troubles.We  
waited to have it by him by end of this session but he passed from his  
eminent loud and clear voice of silver speech to unknown vistas of  
golden silence like Lord Dakshinamurti !  
  
May the Lord bestow on his guileless soul peace and divine bliss !  
  
Om Shaantih Shaantih Shaantih !
