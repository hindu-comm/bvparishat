\> I am glad to inform all the scholars here that "The Electronic Text of The Mahabharata with Hyper Links" has been brought out by Rashtriya Sanskrit Vidyapeetha, Tirupati in 2008. Prof. S.S.Murthy Garu,Department of Vyakarana, RSVidyapeeth was the Principal Inviestigator & Coordinator of the Project. I (Rani Sadasiva Murty) had the fortune of being its Coordinator. With the kind and noble of help of some other scholars just with in a span of one calendar year we could bring out this Electronic Text.

Thank you very much for the information and the work. Is this available in ASCII or similar format also? After several months of work, we have developed a fair degree of competence in algorithms for sorting, citation-matching in spite of पाठान्तरs, etc., and having the same would be helpful.

We have also prepared a श्लोकार्धसूची for the entire BORI Mahabharata. This is a PDF file, 1254 two-column pages in size-9 Devanagari font, about 11 MB in size. Will be happy to make this available to any interested scholar.

Regards,

Shrisha Rao
