**Namaste.  
Esteemed Members,  
  
This is indeed a heartening step towards recognizing Samskrutam  
as the Tongue of BhAratamAtA by putting Samskrutam on census records  
as our Mother('s) Tongue!  
  
Here at Sringeri(The Divine Hill Town of Sri Sharadamba) the teachers who have  
training for taking census are given hints on how to go about to make this effort  
rewarding and practical.  
  
Those houses wherein the members are familiar with Sanskrit/Samskrutam are  
requested to record it as their Mother Tongue. This initiative is said to have been  
taken by Samskrtia Bharati. This will be through out Karnataka. Hope that will be  
the case across the nation.  
  
Wisdom,better late than never, seems to have dawn. And if a Teacher wills  
changes do happen. Let it be.So be it.  
  
VandE mAtaram!
