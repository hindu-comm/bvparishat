Various fonts and coding systems do provide for Vedic accents (e.g., the Velthuis fonts have for well over a decade), but there is no Unicode standard for them. The issues are therefore that (i) not every Unicode-compliant font will support Vedic accents (as the standard does not include them); and (ii) a coding that renders correctly in one font is not guaranteed to render correctly in another.

It would be good for a larger number of our scholars to participate actively in the defining and scrutiny of language encoding standards, development of fonts, etc. Leaving it just to Western scholars is ill-advised. Besides the questions of their competence and interest, it is also to be noted that a lot of work related to Indic languages and scripts these days is motivated by pecuniary considerations (i.e., how to create software that can be sold to the many people in India who do not speak/write English well). Hence the lack of attention to such things as Vedic accents, which do not make anyone a quick buck.
