Dear Scholars:  
It is possible. There are special characters available. To insert in  
both the Devanaagarii, as well as in transliterated text, is  
difficult. I have been working on this problem for the last three  
years mostly with help from friends. I have been holding up a 4 volume  
study with English tranlation just because of this. Fairly soon I  
shall find whether it works. Since I have zero technical expertise in  
this matter, I cannot offer you any detailed information. Once I am  
able to accomplish this seemingly impossible feat I wii certainly  
offer full details. I hope to be able to do this very soon.
