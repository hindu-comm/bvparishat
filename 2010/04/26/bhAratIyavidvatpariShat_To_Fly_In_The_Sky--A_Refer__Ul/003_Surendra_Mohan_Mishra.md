Dear Sir,  
Namaskar.  
The references to flying in the sky by yogic merits or by flying machines are so many in sanskrit sources.Kalidasa has it at many times,in the Shaakuntalam also while Dushyanta is coming down to Maaricha's ashrama.In the Raghuvamsha 13th canto Raama flies back to Ayodhya with Sita,beautiful descriptions are there.The Maagha kaavya strts with Naarada's coming down from the sky wherein MM Phanibhushana Tarkavagisha sees the distinction between indeterminate and determinate perceptions.In Autobiography of a Yogi by Swami Yogananda Paramahansa you have it more than once.  
Professor C S R Rao of NIC,Hyderabad is working scientifically on the about 100 flying machines that he has come across described in certain Sanskrit shaastra.MM Gopinath Kaviraj of Benaras has mane such anecdotes in his Bhaaratiiya Saadhanaar Dhaaraa also available in Hindi translation.Shankara's disciple Padmapaada also could walk on the waters and wherever he would set his foot a lotus would manifest,hence his name" Padmapaada"-lotus-footed.The Yogasuutras of Patanjali and before that in the Vedic and Tantric traditions this is there.As an achievement its not of much worth spiritually,but due to peculiar praarabdha or a natural fallout of yogic discipline this may manifest.As Vyaasa in his yoga-commentary says this may be quite an achievement in vyutthaana but in view of higher samaadhi thjis may be an impediment.Its therefore in all schools of esoteric practices such powers gained at distinct levels of yoga are asked to be passed through in silence and not exhibited.  
Regards,
