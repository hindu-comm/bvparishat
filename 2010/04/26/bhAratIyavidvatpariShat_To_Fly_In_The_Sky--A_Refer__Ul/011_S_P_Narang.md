In our childhood we have seen that Kaparda was a coin in the market. It was not very significant coin but Paisa with a hole in it and a flat round copper coin was important and fetched good commodieites from the market. Times are changed and changing rapidly. Even ten Rs. not is becoming insignificant now. Let us investigate in the light of the word used in the text and its time. Regards, spnarang
