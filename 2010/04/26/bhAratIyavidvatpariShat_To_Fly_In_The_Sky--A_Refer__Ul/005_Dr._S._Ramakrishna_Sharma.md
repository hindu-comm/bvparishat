नमो विद्वद्भ्य:  
Having studied different responses from varied stand points **To Fly In The Sky--A Reference In Sanskrit,  
**I would like to share a few points for re-thinking against the background of शास्त्रं and व्यवहार:  
Sri I V N Acharya's presentation has a significant objective as highlighted below.  

  
\>संस्कृत वाङ्मये स्थितं कंचन वैज्ञानिकं विषयं निवेदयितु मिच्छामि।  

It refers to Indian scientific achievement. No scientific knowledge should  
remain unexplored with a view to maintain cosmic harmony through proper  
attitude and right education for using the Laws of Nature for the spiritual  
Goal of लोकसंग्रह: and लोककल्याण(one is cosmic consolidation and the other is  
cosmic welfare/well being - this subtle difference needs deep study).  
Take the case of any true Acharya in Sanatana Dharma Tradition. Each one of  
them was a nimittam for for many and varied miracles. Their first line of disciples  
also were equally so. And many, later, in their lineage have proven that they too  
are nimittam.  
This is because, those who were only श्रोत्रिय: or merely ब्रह्मनिष्ठ: did not have access  
to the अधिभूतशक्तिप्रपंच: for the reason that the former is unable to log in and the latter  
does not bother to log in.  
**The most ideal Acharya who can lead and guide the society is one who is master of both  
शास्त्रं and व्यवहार: by being both श्रोत्रिय: and ब्रह्मनिष्ठ:\|\|  
Sri Shankaracharya would not have added in His Bhashya "न च गृहस्थस्य निराशीरपरिग्रह इत्यादिवचनमनुकुलं "\|if abandoning and ignoring everything else is the only meaning of Tyaga:.  
That सिद्धि :is the sign of शुद्धि: is to be noted and ought not to be decried.  
But using it indiscriminately would cause FALL.  
From the riks of Purusha Sukta the most modern cost effective method/technology of/for producing electricity is already on the way, thanks to [www.agragami.in](http://www.agragami.in) and dandavatpranams to H.H Jagadguru Sri Abhinava Vidya Tirtha Mahasannidhanam of Sringeri Dakshinamnaya Sri Sharada Peethom.  
**  
The Vedic research methodology is seemingly lost to posterity. But really not so. **द्वे विद्ये वेदितव्ये** cannot be wrong .And this includes all Vidyas, Sciences. We have to pursue till we reach the integral Goal of Akhila-Purushartha.  
**प्रणाम:**
