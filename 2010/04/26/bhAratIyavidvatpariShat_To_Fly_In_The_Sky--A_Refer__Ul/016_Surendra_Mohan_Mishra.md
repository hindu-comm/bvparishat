Thanks to all for the inf. on cowrie.कपर्दक,कपर्दिका,कपर्द,कपर्दी - these words and वराटक,वराटिका etc were used for this purpose.The word fee is from the word पशु as earlier animals like cows and horses were money in the barter system.Since 20 cowries made up one paisa which was coin with a hole(we have such coins in Japan now),in Odisha and Bengal the word for twenty is कोडिए and कुडी respectively.This was called फुटा पइसा in Odia.I have seen wooden chests full with such cowries,which were also used for religious and cultural purposes including sophisticated games of various kinds.The word 'kaparda'is derived from क+पर्+दै +क । Is दै the same as दैप् शोधने ?  
When it was actual money,to find a handful from the sea-shore must have made sense ! नमांसि ।
