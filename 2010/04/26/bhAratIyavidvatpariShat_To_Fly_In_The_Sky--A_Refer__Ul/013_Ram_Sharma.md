Dear Prof Narang Ji,  
 So happy to catch a vidvdagragaNya like you in Bharatiya VidvatpariShad .How are you?You must be doing something great as usual..As earlier,I will always be interested to know more and more about your prjects-both -official as well as personal..  
 I hope, you will not mind nor will Prof Tripathi mind my naming a Maatrika Metre "RaaSHTriyaSaMskRtaSaMsthaanam" by splitting the VaarNika metre HaMsagati/MahaataruNiidayitam into two parts as follows:  
 viSHame SHoDasha maatraash ca ,same  
caturdasha syur yadi maatraaH/  
ardhasamaM tan MaatrikavRttaM  
"RaaSHTriyaSaMskRtasaMsthaanam.".  
 All the best,  
 Ram Karan Sharma
