A Unicode font that also support Vedic characters is Chandas

Besides the font aspect we need to consider a number of other features  
like rendering using commercial/free software, transliteration, store and  
retrieve using popular databases etc

Vedic content from Krishna Yajurveda and RgVeda has been converted to  
displayable, searchable and indexed form suitable for web viewing and is  
hosted at the following web site

[www.parankusa.org](http://www.parankusa.org)

Please use the following links to view Yajurveda and Rgveda in text form  
by individual sections
