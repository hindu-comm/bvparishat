Namo vidvadbhyah



I am very much thankful to Prof N R Joshi . However the merit goes to my Gurus .



In my 13th Feb posting I quoted Patanjali (samarthah padavidhih 2-1-1) -- it is impossible to offer or register the

meanings of dhatus etc. . I rather think that there is no reason for puzzling . Please consider the folloing ( some of

these points are repeated) --



Language changes - is the general rule . This is applicable more to a language in use (spoken). Rather as it is explained

by Katyayana ( siddhe sabdaarthasambandhe lokatah arthaprayukte sabdaprayoge sastrena dharmaniyamah kriyate)

- unless and until the trio, i.e. sabda, artha and their relation , are immutable it is not possible to compile a grammar

(otherwise there will be chaos -- Indian Govt started 'Standardization of Languages', here is the end ? Which Telugu and

which Hindi is convincingly Standard ?). Sanskrit is associated with Dharma and may be due to this reason that

the general tendency of change is arrested to a maximum extent.



Panini offered the gamut of words in three ways - 1. Vidhi = Prakrti and Pratyaya are offered , we have to combine.

2. Nipaata = literally means pronunciation (of ready made word) - we have to separate the parts - srotriyah, ksetriyah.

3. Prsodaraadiini yathopadistam(6-3-109) = the sabdas that are being used by Sistas of Aryavarta, such as prsodara,

jimuta etc., but not analysed in Astadhyayi areaceptable. Yatra varnalopaagamavikaaraah drsyante nacocyante -

Patanjali.



In the last category there are words like anaphaa, sunaphaa, duradhuraa (Yogas in Jyotisa, from Persian) and some

more wherein some change occurs.



There are 1137 Sakhas of Vedas, Vedangas, Upavedas, Darsanas, Puranas etc. and the spoken language with all

its Dialects. One has to take into consideration all these things and fix / assign meaning.



The word 'annam' means the one that is being eaten and the one that eats away (the consumer) -- adyate'tti ca bhuutaani, tasmaadannam taducyata it ( Anandavally, Taittiriyopanisad).



Take the word 'guna' and see the meanings in Ayurveda (Vatapittakaphaah), Samkhya, Vyakarana, Mimamsa, Nyaya,

Alamkara and so on .



Hari in Vakyapadiya ( Vakyakanda - samyogo viprayogasca), Kautalya in Arthasastra (Tantrayuktis - 15 Adhikarana),

Caraka(Tantrayuktis-Siddhisthanam - 40) and Susruta (Tantrayuktis-Uttaratantram - 65-4) tried to provide a number of Deciding Factors of Meaning in case of 'sabdaarthasyaanavacchede visesasmrtihetavah'. What for ? There has always been problem about meaning .

At sentence level there are 24 Nyayas in Purvamimamsa to decide the meaning.

Philosophy of meaning is a difficult , unending and scholarly subject . Most of the people are poor in this subject as knowledge of

other sastras is essential in many cases. For example Tantrayuktis are not touched (take any Alamkaragrantha).

Let me give an example(presently I am teaching to my M Phil student) - Devadattah pacate -- the aatmanepada means - Devadatta

is arranging for cooking (and not Devadatta is cooking). Yajnadatta or someone employed is doing the job. Because Panini says

'kartrabhipraaye kriyaaphale'(aatmanepadam). The result finally goes to Prayojakakarta, i.e. Devadatta but not Prayojyakarta (who is

the real cook) . For a detailed discussion see Upagrahasamuddesa of Padakanda of Vakyapadiyam

Why 2000 years ? It is difficult to say. Hari says the following in Sambandhasamuddesa --

indriyaanaam svavisayesvanaadiryogyataa yathaa I anaadirarthaih sabdaanaam sambandho yogyataa tathaa II

Therefore it is anaadi, i.e. we don't know.

Therefore the tradition believes ' offering / registering all the meanings (vaacya only) of all dhatus etc is difficult.

We should not leave it there . Scholars like Dr Joshi are verymuch required today for maintaining the heat of discussions . Otherwise

here is Hari at the end of Vakyakanda - praayena samkseparuchiin alpavidyaaparigrahaan praapya samgrahe'stamupaagate.

Mahabhasyam is not being paid attention.

In order to get good aquaintance with any Sastra I suggest Gurukula type of education.

What Korada is doing ? He is going to conduct a heavy Workshop on Mahabhasyam and Vakyapadiyam (all Vedangas and

all Darsanas , Arthasastra and Ayurveda are covered) during April/May 2010. Pl wait for the anouncement here.

The delay in my response may be condoned keeping my schedule in mind.

Respected Scholars, Namaskar!  
  
In the following discussion I am using the word “word” because it is easy to write. In my earlier postings I presented differences among lexemes, pada, Vaakya etc.  
  
First I would like to thank Dr. Surendramohan Mishra for his posting on Feb.25. I appreciate his encouraging words about my speculations on meanings of letter-sounds. I did not use the phrase “meaning at an atomic level” because in modern physics the word “atom” carries a lot of information. So if we understand atomic means ‘reduced to the smallest unit (VarNa) of Vaak” then it is OK. The Jain linguists believed that words are material substances made up of atoms which are distinct from other material atoms in nature. The atoms of words are designated as sound-atoms in order to distinguish them from the material atoms. Naiyayikas opposed Jain theory.  
As a matter of fact Sanskrit words and their meanings is one of the main topics discussed in Philosophy of Language in India for past 2000 years. All schools and Acharyas (Upavarsha, Shankar, Kumaril Bhatta etc) Jain, Bauddha, Vaidika participated in this debate.  
Dr. S. Korad always respond carefully giving all pertinent details, I have great respect for him. I get puzzled when he wrote (Feb. 13 posting) “it is impossible to offer or register the meanings of all dhaatus, praatipadikas, pratyayas and nipatas”. This may be true in certain cases. However if we accept the thesis that meaning convention is very old in Sanskrit, changes of meanings have occurred, changes of sound have occurred, then my question is  
“What was the purpose of debate among grammarians, Naiyayikas, and many other schools on “Words and Meanings?” And what is the purpose of scholars like S.D. Joshi, Bimal Matilal, Gaurinath Shastry, K. Kunjunni Raja, Padmarajia (Jain theories). R.C. Pandeya, and of many other scholars in writing books on “Words and Meanings” in Indian philosophy of language? These books offer good review of the debate for the past 2000 years. Is that all? Are we just happy to know that we debated the topic? Thanks. N. R. Joshi
