Ayi vidvadvaryaah,

Namaskaarah.

With regard to the issue of Vaishravana in the Mantrapushpam the  
expressions 'raajaadhiraaja','vaishravana' and 'mahaaraaja'appear to  
be used for Kubera only.  
The first one may also be an adjective/epithet of Shiva,but here the  
statement doesn't warrant this.This is synonymous with 'raajaraaja' in  
Amara.

Raavana and Kubera are born of Vishravas through Keshinii/Kaikasii and  
Idavidaa respectively thus making them half-brothers,both are  
Vaishravana and Paulastya(grandsons of Pulastya).

Kubera has a peculiar malformed body : three legs,eight teeth only and  
a yellow spot in place of the second eye.If this is symbolic how to  
explain this ?

Saprashrayabahumaanam,
