Namaste.

\>This Mantrapushpa is common in all worships whether the deity is Siva or Vishnu. Hence it is indicator of "paratatva".

ABSOLUTELY TRUE. That observation was mailed as reply to author/me by  
an esteemed member.  
Part of the "Dandaka" is suitably amended to fit into the context of  
Siva or Vishnu(etc)  
as the case may be. Like, "Nandi-Bhringi-Chanda-Kundodara-Patanjali-  
Vyaghrapada-  
Vinayaka-Shanmukhadyaih sakalapramathaganasevitasevyamanasya...." for  
Siva and  
for Vishnu something else.

As the line of thought got gravitated towards Siva under whom Kubera  
functions  
the reference got delimited. (As Eshana, Siva is adhipati of the NE  
direction)

\>The interpretation as its being applicable to Shiva exclusively, may be far fetched  
as any of these names may be used in the thousand names of any God and  
could be made  
applicable to the deity. In our region, it is used in the mantrapushpa  
after the end  
of any worship (not exclusively of Shiva).

That was another pertinent observation from another esteemed member.  
These two  
posts are obviously caused by my apparent emphasis on Siva due to lack  
of diligent  
thought editing.

Thanks to both of them.

HOWEVER, the following query demands discussion in a new direction,  
while the first  
query as to the brotherhood of Vaishravana and Kubera is still kept  
pending.  
IT IS THIS:  
\>After all, what was puzzling me is what is the place of this mantra in the  
mantrapuShpa than being a mantra without any specific reference to the  
deity  
in whose worship this is used.

One possible answer to the puzzle is that Kubera, being the Deity in  
charge  
of Nidhi-Wealth-Sampat, has got to be specifically invoked in the  
congregational  
gathering in any temple for tapping the resources for the welfare of  
all. Keeping in  
mind the "TATHASTU" in chorus by the brahmins mainly and others in the  
gathering  
in the temples, this becomes obvious.  
In the Panchayatana Puja of any of the five Devatas, this Kubera  
Mantra is used  
with this intention and reason during/after the last Mangalarati.

HERE AGAIN, Smarta traditions and Vaishnava traditons do differ. What  
matters  
is one's own Upasana, parampara and upadesha.

Pranams.
