Namaste.  
  
This mantra referred to is (known to me) used as part of
"Mantrapushpam", for Lord Shiva in temples in Dandaka style: Om devadevOthama, devatAsArvabhauma, akhilAndakotibrahmAndanAyaka...... .  
...NidhanapatayE namah, NidhanapatAnthikAya namah... etc(Taittiriya Aranyaka?).  
  
Besides, it may be noted that these are names used extolling Lord Shiva. He is RajAdhirAja.  
NrttAvasAnE NatarAjarAjO.. also refers to Him as RajarAja.  
  
Further, (still to be investigated) whether there are yaksha brothers having same names under reference or not, like Tumburu- Narada pairs?  
Again, in viniyoga what is the place of these such as parivAra, Avarana or upa-gaNa?  
  
Thanks for initiating this line of thought.  
Regards.
