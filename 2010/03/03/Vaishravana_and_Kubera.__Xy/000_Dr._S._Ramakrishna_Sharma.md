Thank you, Sri C.L Prabhakar Ji for the above query. I love to use the  
facility of language choice available in the other mail account which is  
not visible in this mail dialogue box. Hence, I typed it there and pasted  
the draft here.([direct...@gmail.com]())  
  
Namaste, All.  
  
While seeking meaning/s to anything which belongs to our BhAratiya  
culture let us keep in mind the following. Although this post may seem  
to appear lengthy, whatever I have "seen" while posting this is crucial  
and relevant to seeking "Indian meaning" to Indian Culture.  
  
As Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore rightly and powerfully put it,  
".....the last meaning points to Thee."-Gitanjali.  
  
People take the meaning that pleases them. And yet, culture being  
a set of living values and meanings intergenerationally transferred  
in and through living we need to adhere to our ways of deriving the  
meanings. And the following criteria are to be followed.  
  
\* श्रुतिस्म्रुतिपुराण -इतिहासानाम एकवाक्यता (- तत्तु समन्वयात) \|  
\* अध्यात्म-अधिभूत-अधिदैव-अर्थ-समन्वय: \|  
\* श्रुति-युक्ति-अनुभव-दृष्टान्त-समन्वय: \|  
For this to be achieved first we should unlearn whatever English  
opium has taught us.  
We do not have Myths and Mythology in the Western sense.  
We have to refer to मंत्रशास्त्र to refer to the ध्यानश्लोका: of देवता: to find out  
the identity of वैश्रवण and कुबेर \|  
Hope to get them soon.
