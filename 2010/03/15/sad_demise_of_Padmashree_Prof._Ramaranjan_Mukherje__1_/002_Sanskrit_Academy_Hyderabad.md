It is really a sad news. Prof. Ramaranjan Mukharjee was a great  
scholar. His services to establish a good base for Sanskrit studies in  
modern India are remarkable. Recently I had an opportunity to visit  
School of Vedic Studeis at Ravindra Bharati University in Kolkata,  
which was set up during his tenure as VC of that university.

BVP expresses its condalences to his family members.
