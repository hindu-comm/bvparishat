namo vidvadbhyah



I am really thankful to all the Members of the Parisat for the affection and encouragement, specially to

Prof NR Joshi , who makes me revisit the Vedas, Vedangas, Darsanas etc. so that the things I learnt

are green in my mind.



Before venturing upon the discussion on Sanskrit Language one has to bear in mind the following facts --



1\. Just like in the case of six Anadis in Vedantadarsana, there is no othergo but to accept that the Sanskrit

Language is Anaadi.



2.In Gopathabrahmana. Aitareyabrahmana, Maitrayaniyasamhita, Katantravyakarana etc. the System of

Vyakarana is discussed using the Terminology ( naamarupe vyaakaravaani, ko dhaatuh, kim pratipadikam etc.).



3\. In Rktantra, Katantravyakarana etc. the Birtha / Pracaara/ Prasaara of Vyakaranawas described --

Brahma - Brhaspati - Indra - bharadvaja - Rsis - Brahmanas ( so not from scratch and one has to depend

upon these words -- Sanskrit has come like this, where Brahmins have come is to be discussed separately).



4.The language was created by Devatas as per the uninterrupted tradition -- deviim vaacamajanayanta devaah.



 No doubt , there will always be problem with the form of language ( deterioration). Bhartrhari asserts -



daivy vaak vyavakiirneyam asaktaih abhidhaatrbhih (Vakyapadiyam 1-155) and also both Sabdas and

Apasabdas are there continuosly in the tradition --



ubhayesaam avicchedaat (Vakya 1-156).

  
Rather, although there is no difference as far as the transformation of meaning is concerned, Sabdas

would fetch Dharma ( see Paspasa ) --



sistebhya aagamaatsiddhaa saadhavo dharmasaadhanam

arthapratyaayanaabhede vipariitaastvasaadhavah ( Vakya 1-27)



What about the Vyavasthaa --



nityatve krtakatve vaa tesaam aadirna vidyate , praaninaamiva sa caisaa vyavasthaanityatocyate (Vakya1-28)



Vaiyaakaranas believe in Kuutasthanityata ( in Vedaanta it is Brahma) of Sabdas, i.e. the form is immutable,

whereas for others , like Naiyaayikas, it is Pravaahanityataa or Vyavahaaranityataa . Then also in order to save

the Svara etc. Vyakarana is required , not a futile exercise (Vakya 1-29) --



naanarthikaam imaam kascid vyavasthaam kartumarhati , tasmaat nibadhyate sistaih saadhutvavisayaa smrtih  


Such task can be fulfilled only by Yogis (Vakya 1-37 & 38) --



aavirbhuutaprakaasaanaam anupaplutacetasaam, atiitaanaagatajnaanam pratyaksaanna visisyate

atiindriyaanasamvedyaan pasyantyaarsena caksusaa, ye bhaavaan vacanam tesaam naanumaanena baadhyate



If one does not believe in this he should not believe in Yoga and Ayurveda also . Aksapada also says (Nyayasu.

2-1-68)-

mantraayurvedapraamaanyavacca tatpraamaanyam aaptapraamaanyaat ( here tat = Vedavaakyaani)





5\. The Prakriyaa can be defferent but the end-product should be the same --



Raamah = Panini - raama + su ; Sakatayana - raama + ru ; Sakalya - raama + ri



Bhavati = bhuu + a + ti ; bhuu + ati ; bhava + ti .



yadekam prakriyaabhedaih bahudhaa pravibhajyate, tad vyaakaranamaagamya param brahmaadhigamyate.



So it is again due to the fear of Adharma that at least the Brahmanas of Aryavarta were protecting the Form

of Sanskrit ( in families such as ours standard language , i.e. Telugu , only is allowed ) - see prsodaraadini

yathopadistam ( Panini 6-3-109).



The point of Primitive societies , cattle grazing people etc is not the subject matter of Vyakarana. Even today

we have such people in Andaman etc.

The Theory of Infomation is not applicable to such works of Yogis who possess 'Divyadrsti'(clairvoyance).

The Form of Sabdas naturally changes , that'swhy Vyakaranam is required - raksohaagamalaghvasamdehaah

prayojanam (Paspasa).



There are, no doubt, other Vyakaranas but none of them can surpass Panini . Please chek the corresponding

Sutra for Panini's - maaturutsamkhyaasambhadrapuurvaayaah (4-1-115).



6\. Certainly, Paninian Vyakarana is on a very firm platform rather than on a slippery slope.



7\. Padaprakrtih samhitaa - is Rkpratisakhya . Samhitaa means Vakyam , and Sasthiisamaasa, i.e. first it is

Vakyam and Padas are carved out of it ( see Vakyapadiyam 2- 58)--



padaprakrtibhaavasca vrttibhedena varnyate, padaanaam samhitaa yonih samhitaa vaa padaasrayaa.



Please refer to Laghumanjusa, Saktivicarah -- since Vakyas (and Mahavakyas) are innumerable Vaiyakaranas

had come down to Padas (Avantaravakyas) since they are also infinite in number (naantam jagaama - Paspasa)

they came down to Prakrti and Pratyaya thru Apoddhaara (Vakya 1-24,25,26) . So an impartite sentence only is

acceptable . Naiyayikas took Prakrti and Pratyaya as the real candidates and it it not the Siddhata
