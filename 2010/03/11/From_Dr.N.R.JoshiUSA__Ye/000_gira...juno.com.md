First Yugadi New Year (March 16) Shubhechaa to all!

  
Respected Scholars, Namaskar!

Can phonemic symbolism be extended to Sanskrit grammatical endings?

We all are grateful to Dr. S. Korad for taking time out through his busy teaching and research schedule to participate in discussions on this list. I certainly benefit from his comprehensive writings. It is difficult for me to paraphrase the long article by Dr. S. Mohan Mishra. He emphasizes the fact that ancient Indian traditions in Sanskrit grammar, linguistics are not closed books. There is room for questions and bring out new features of the existing systems.

Let us assume that words and meanings relationships are Anādi as described by Dr. S. Korad. Dr. S. D. Joshi in his book (on Aşţādhyāyī) says, “We do not know where Sanskrit came from and where Brahmins came from”? This raises many interesting questions.

The approximate picture long before Panini is this in my opinian-  
People or at least Brahmins from the ancient India were speaking Sanskrit. It is also clear from the concept of “Apoddhāra padārtha” (meaning gotten through extraction), that syntactic units (pada) are extracted from an impartite spoken utterance and which in turn were analyzed into smaller units such as bases (prak®ti) and affixes (pratyaya) for the sake of grammatical description. The same is true for a meaning of the utterance, which is equally impartite, analyzed into words meanings, from which are abstracted further the meanings of the smaller units, using the reasoning of Anvaya (logical connection) and Vyatireka (logical discontinuance) for the sake of grammatical description. Here padaartha means the meaning (artha) of the pada (syntactic unit). So we assume here that language was there first and grammar arrived later on.

There is less than ten percent difference in Language of Vedas and Bhāşā of Pāņini. Both of these versions have inflections, that is, elaborate grammatical endings. Some scholars are of the opinion that ancient Asian societies including Indian of the Vedic era were living in the primitive stage of civilization.

First question-  
Why do the cattle grazing primitive societies need such highly inflected language like Sanskrit? Today in order to write scientific papers we use English without inflections (words next to words). If you have answer, please let me know.

Second question-  
Let us assume that Vedas with their highly inflected language were known from the very ancient time, and were revealed to sages. In that case also why does the nature (or divine) need such highly inflected language to reveal verses of Vedas? One cannot create such language from the scratch.

One obvious use of elaborate grammatical endings is that it makes meaning relatively free of word order. The second reason of having grammatical endings could be to establish the semantic continuity.

Third question-  
Can semantic continuity be achieved if we substitute new grammatical endings tomorrow in place of old ones?  
The answer is yes if grammatical endings were chosen randomly to look different from each other. But if they indicate meanings based on the meanings of individual phonemes present in them, then the answer is no.  
The third reason could be that nature does not like redundancy. In other words nature would like to communicate maximum amount of meaning with minimum number of sounds. This is possible if the individual phonemes present in lexemes and in grammatical endings of syntactic units (Padas) carry semantic significance. In this case the language becomes the most efficient code for communication.

So far I did not touch grammatical endings with my phonemic symbolism. Dr, Shrivara wanted me to extend it to the past passive participles (like Naşţa. Kŗşţa etc). Development of languages of India (like Marathi, Hindi) shows that grammatical endings undergo changes faster than the phonemes in the lexemes.

Fourth question-  
How do we know that Sanskrit grammatical endings did not undergo changes of phonemes?  
If we take archaeological evidence of Mitanni (1350 BC) into consideration, then Sanskrit has history of at least 900 years before Panini. In such a long period of history, what is guaranty that Sanskrit grammatical endings did not undergo changes? According to Information theory, information which is certain in the beginning tends to become uncertain with passage of time.

Those who believe that Sanskrit was developed in ancient India by interaction with outsiders (Aryans), for them grammatical endings also went through developments. Since they believe in evolution of language features, phonemic symbolism cannot fit in their random selection scheme.

There are different systems of Sanskrit grammar. Please see the books.  
(1) Bengal’s contribution to Sanskrit grammar in the Paninian and Cāndra Systems by Kali Charana Shastri.  
He says in the preface of the book that technical terms of Sanskrit grammar became meaningless after a time. Technical terms of grammar in one system become meaningless in another system. Examples are given.  
(2) The Aindra school of Sanskrit Grammar by A, C, Burnell  
(3)Technical Terms and Techniques of Sanskrit Grammar by Kshitish Chandra Chatterji.  
(4) Katantra grammar  
(5) Jainendra grammar

Fifth question  
Is Sanskrit grammar resting a slippery slope?

If you answer my questions, then I will venture into explaining grammatical forms using my phonemic symbolism. Thanks. N. R. Joshi
