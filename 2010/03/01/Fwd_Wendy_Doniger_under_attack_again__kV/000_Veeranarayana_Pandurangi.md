Trouble at t'mill once again.  
  
Vishal Agarwal has posted a message here:

asking people to sign a petition to Penguin demanding that they withdraw her  
book\*The Hindus: An Alternative History\* from publication and that Penguin  
apologize (to whom?) for publishing her book.  
  
Best,  
Dominik
