**“He who cannot explain it to a 6 years old child,  
has not understood it himself.”**

**Albert Einstein  
  
**

**“The only thing that counts is intuition.”**

**Albert Einstein  
**  
**For those who have practical experience with it, intuition is the natural golden magic key of revelation and leads to true, real authentic knowledge about what is “played” behind the scenes - also in creation.  
  
**

**“On the way of discovery the intellect has little to do.  
There is a leap in consciousness,  
call it intuition or whatever you like,  
and the solution comes to you,  
and you do not know how and why.”**

**- Albert Einstein**
