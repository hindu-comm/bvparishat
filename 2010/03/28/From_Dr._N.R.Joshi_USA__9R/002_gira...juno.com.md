Respected Scholars, Namaskar!

First I would like to thank Dr. S Korad who is always a great help in promoting the right knowledge of Sanskrit for all of us. Lately Prof.K.V.Ramakrishnamacharyulu is making valuable contribution to this list. My thanks to him also.

Let us now handle the question of Dr. Shriniwas Varakhedi-dated Feb. 27, 2010  
Can my phonemic symbolism be extended to explain formations of past passive participles like Bhraşţa, Naşţa etc. The process of deciphering composite meaning of a word based upon semantic patterns of individual phonemes is slow. I repeat I have based my semantic patterns of Sanskrit phonemes on periodic physical properties of articulated sounds of Varņamāla. With this short introduction, let us start.

I must explain first the semantic pattern of /ş/. In my Varņamāla, the phoneme on the left of /ş/ is /s/ and on the right is /h/. I rearranged the last two rows of Sanskrit Varņamāla.

Semantic pattern of the letter sound /ş/

It means, “loosely connected”. Let us see examples.

\(1\) Bhuşaņa: The ornament on the body of a person like necklace is loosely connected.  
(2) Uşas: The dawn is loosely connected to the sun.  
(3) Tuşāra: In a spray or shower, liquid particles are loosely connected.  
(4)Cuş: In sucking a candy, tongue is loosely connected to the candy.  
(5)Uşņa: As a body becomes hotter and hotter, atoms start becoming loose leading to the last stage of melting.  
(6)Veşa: No matter how tight is the dress, one has to put on or take off. That is possible when there is some looseness.  
(7)şaɖsānu: The word means a peacock by referring to it plumage. The plumage is loosely connected.  
(8) Kŗş: To plough. In ploughing the farm, a farmer makes soil loose.  
(9)śuş: To be dried. When a leaf dries up, it looses its moisture and starts crumbling.  
(10) Gharşaņa: During friction one objects moves over the other. It happens when contact is loose and not tight.  
(11)Vŗşaņa: It means the scrotum. It is loosely connected.  
(12) Vŗşin: A peacock with loosely connected feathers.  
(13) Varş: Rain is loosely connected to the earth.  
(14) Bhāş: Speaking or uttering consists of words in sequence loosely connected. If the speaker connects all words to each other physically (like scholars fond of long train of sandhis), then no body understands him.  
(15) śeşa: It means a remainder. One can take it as the remainder of the process of division. Remainder is loosely connected to the dividend. This word has second meaning of serpent. You decide now whether it is loosely connected to somebody or not. The semantic pattern “decrease in amplitude” of the phoneme /ś/ explained earlier is present in the meaning of this word.  
(16) Muşţi: It means fist. The meaning of /ţ/ is “to bow out “ as explained before. During the clenching of hand one can bend fingers because in each finger there are three bones loosely connected (meaning of /ş/. So the phonemic symbolism based on physical properties of sounds works.  
(17) Veşţanam: An envelope is loosely connected to the inside object.  
(18) Kŗşţ: Ploughed, drawn, dragged. The purpose of ploughing is to make soil loosely connected. On the other hand one cannot plough a rocky earth. It has to be loosely connected. When a magnet attracts a nail of iron, magnetic lines are bent and they surround the magnet loosely.  
(19) Bhraşţa: A loosely connected person to his position is driven out.  
(20) Naşţa: destroyed during process of bowing out because it was either loosely connected or became loose.  
(21) Tvaşţrā: Here please think of the ākhyāyikā of what the father-in-law Tvaşţrā did to his son-in-law, the sun. Do you see the meanings of both /ş/ and /ţ/.?

These examples are enough to carry the point. This is the “internal beauty of Sanskrit” which relates culture to language. But distilling out semantic patterns of phonemes is a slow process. It works because I set it on the solid foundation of physical properties of articulated sounds. In short I brought the discussion on semantics from the high level of abstract mystic sphoţa down to the level of concrete physics of sounds. This is a sort of language engineering. Your comments will be honored. Thanks. N. R. Joshi.
