Respected Scholars, Namaskar!

First I would like to thank Prof. K.V. Ramakrishnamacharyulu for explaining the word , “Abhinişţhāna”.

Some times it is difficult understand etymology of Sanskrit words.

Could some one explain please the following two words?

\(1\) Bhargya An epithet of śiva

\(2\) Mŗda An epithet of śiva

If both are epithets of the same deity, what different attributes of the deity they describe? Thanks. N.R.Joshi
