**Dear Professor**

**This is in continuation of my previous letter.**

**We bring out a monthly Sanskrit Journal, called, *Sri Guru Sarvabhouma,* which is dedicated to the cause of propagating Vedanta and knowledge about Nyaya, Vyakarana, Meemansa and other disciplines of spiritual value.**

**I am pleased to enclose herewith two recent Issues of the Journal, which have been brought out under my editorship, (would be sent separately, if your postal address is communicated to me).**

**I am writing this to make two specific requests: **

· **Firstly, I request you kindly put us on the mailing list for your Journal, News Letters and other regular publications. I am sure these would be useful to our students, teachers and researchers;**

· **Secondly, I would like to request you kindly send good articles in Sanskrit, authored by you and your colleagues, in the fields of Sahitya, Nyaya, Vyakarana, Meemansa etc. for our consideration for publication in our Journal.**

**I am keen to maintain high standards and quality for our Journal and make it hitherto more useful to all those who are interested in Sanskrit and Indology.**

**I would be grateful if you give your utmost cooperation and help.**

**Thanking you and with warm regards,**

**Yours Sincerely**

**V.R.Panchamukhi**
