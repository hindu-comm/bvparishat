***Respected scholars,***

****

***It is very painful to see that at times a few learned scholars write emails or attach documents giving the wrong chronology of Ancient Indian History, given in the official history books, in spite of their familiarity with the ocean of our scriptures and their numerous interpretations.***

****

***For the ready reference of the scholars I am again attaching a very brief write up on how the history of India has been distorted.***

****

***I must add that I am no scholar of the scriptures; I am not even a student of Sanskrit. So I shall be very grateful if the the readers kindly email their questions, criticisms and comments on the write up.***

****

***Yours humbly,***

****

***D.D.Misra***
