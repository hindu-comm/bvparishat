Dear Dr Bandyopadhyaya,

Professor Ramaranjan Mukherji in leaving his mortal coil has left a  
void which is difficult to fill up.The world of Sanskrit and Indology  
will gratefully remember him as one who built, stabilized and  
academically enriched institutions of Bhaaratiiya Vidyaa in it's  
various aspects.As an Academician,an Administrator and above all a Man  
he was precious and rare,his presence lent a definite respectability  
to Sanskrit studies in the whole country and abroad.

Recently he had agreed to deliver the Prof.G.Bhattacharya Memorial  
Lectures for the year 2009 in Kurukshetra University,but had postponed  
it due to his wife's health after which he himself had troubles.We  
waited to have it by him by end of this session but he passed from his  
eminent loud and clear voice of silver speech to unknown vistas of  
golden silence like Lord Dakshinamurti !

May the Lord bestow on his guileless soul peace and divine bliss !

Om Shaantih Shaantih Shaantih !
