Respected Scholars, Namaskar!

Rakshasas and Yakshas

Dr. Surendramohan Mishra raised an interesting question about strange features of Kuvera (Kubera). One faces a lot of problems when making sense out of the stories from the ancient religious books of India. In Mahabharat epic many different types of people were described like Rakshasas, Yakshas, Daityas, Danavas, Gandharvas, Nagas, Pishacas and many more. If all these people were in the Indian subcontinent, then who were outside the subcontinent (especially in the Middle-east and Europe) at the time of Mahabharat war? Of course Chinese and Khasadaya were there up in the north.

Kuvera was the king of Yakshas and Ravana was the king of Rakshasas. They were half brothers. When Ravana conquered Alkavati, the capital of Kuvera, he left Alkavati and went to Kailasa. The capital of Ravana was Lanka (or Lankavati). There is story about Ravana trying to uproot Kailasa island from the bottom but his hands were crushed. In the known history of India there are many references to Yakshas in Buddhist literature. Yakshas were associated with trees. There are sculptures of Yakshas and Yakshinis found in archeological excavations. In the ancient history of Shri Lanka and Maladiva islands Yakshas (yakkhas) appear prominently. Interestingly they appear in the ancient history of Central America (Mexico, Yahico, and Yukatan).

Around 1902, a book was published in USA with the title “Aryan Mexican Linguistics”. In that book there is information that native Americans (Red Indians) knew about huge Divine Monkey. One old German lady is taking care of one sight in the South America. There is huge drawing on the ground of the divine Monkey encircled by his very long tail. Certain tribes of Red Indians had wedding customs similar to those in India (tying the knot of Bridegroom and Bride). Some Indian writers always make error in connecting Maya civilization of the ancient Central America to Mayasura of Soorya Siddhanta. Please note Maya is not the original name of those Red Indians. This name was attached to them by European explorers. Europeans change names.

In the epic Mahabharat when Bheema went towards north pole to bring Saugandhika Lotus flowers, he was stopped by Yaksha soldiers. Duryodhana was captured near Dvaitavana by Gandharva soldiers of Raja Dharmaraja. In the book, “Prachi-Prabha-Perspectives in Indology” (editor-D. C. Bhattacharyya-Harman Pub. House. New Delhi), there is an article on “Yaksha-worship in Kurukshetra” by O.P. Bharadwaj. Although the statues of Yakshas found in Lanka, Maladiva and Central America, show them with gross features, the article says Yakshas were mentioned in the ancient books as models of beauty. Geeta (Chapter 17, verse4) says Rajasa people worship Yakshas and Rakshasas. This may be true because Rajasa people are fond of money. Kuvera was described as the king of riches, wealth.

In many ancient Indian books, Yakshas are described as demons along with Rakshasas. It looks like that Yakshas were milder than Rakshasas. Prachi-Prabha article says that there was Yaksha cult in Kurukshetra. It also says that Kurukshetra was bounded on its four corners by four Yakshas with names, Tarantuka, Arantuka Kapila and Macakruka. However other historians and archaeologists identified these names as names of regions from northern India. However there exists second interpretation-Arantuka was Ukraine, Tarantuka was Chinese Tartary, Macakruka was Manchuria. Thus the boundaries of the ancient Mahabharat Empire were from Ukraine (Aryan presence is attested) to Chinese Tartary and from Manchuria to Ramahrada. Aryans were everywhere from Eastern Europe (Celts in ancient Britain) through Central Asia to Synkyang province of China. There presence was attested in Semi-rechye (land of seven rivers, tiger bones were found) in Kazakhstan. Where was the Ramahrada?

The book on Yakshas by Ananda K. Coomaraswamy offers very interesting accounts of Yakshas. In one account, Yakshamah (let us gobble) and Rakshamah (let us guard) changed them into Yakshas and Rakshasas. The most interesting account is that a toll-house is called Yaksha-sthaana. One explanation is that it was controlled by a Yaksha collecting toll. The other explanation is that narrowing the passage (the phoneme /ksh/) on the way to the toll station followed by expanding passage (the phoneme /y/) after the toll station is crossed is indicated by the word Yaksha. One bank in India placed painting of Yaksha at the door. The bank wants money to grow (Yaksha) and not to diminish (Kshaya). These two words have the same phonemes (with vowel /a/) but they carry opposite meanings. Do phonemes have meanings or their order in words makes difference or both? Please pardon me for a long posting. Please correct me wherever I am wrong so that we grow together in our knowledge. N R. Joshi.
