Respected Scholars, Namaskar!

In praise of Sanskrit Varņamālā

I read the article of Kalpesh Gajiwala on Sanskrit Varņamālā as a tool to evaluate cleft palate speech problems. I liked the paper. I knew Sanskrit Varņamālā is used by some speech therapist. As a matter of fact this (speech therapy-correct pronunciation) was the reason cited by the London Junior school which made Sanskrit a compulsory subject. Dr. Frits Staal in his book (discovering the Vedas) says, “Unlike ABC’s to which there is no rhyme or reason, the Vedic syllabary is rational and practical like Indian numerals”. He declares in his book that Science of Language originated in the ancient India. (My note-not with Celtic and Gothic people of Europe). An engineer should always say "There is room for new design". So there is room in Sanskrit Varņamālā to make it even better.

Knowing the problem with irrational spellings of English words, in 1867 AD, Melville Bell (the father of Alexander Graham Bell-the inventor of telephone) published a book called “Visible Speech, The Science of Universal Alphabetics.” His “Visible Speech“ was entirely different from what we understood today as a sonograph. He invented new symbols (or letters) to which he called “Visible Speech”. This was so because his new symbols specified the pronunciation of word sounds so accurately, that speech thus symbolized could be repeated by anyone else familiar with the method.

If somebody would have taught him Devanagari letters and syllables, then he would have realized such system existed many centuries before him in India.

As I mentioned earlier Russian chemist Mendelev got the idea of Chemical Periodic Table from the periodic table of Sanskrit Varņamālā. He even used Indian numerals to indicate isotopes of some chemical elements. Thanks. N.R.Joshi
