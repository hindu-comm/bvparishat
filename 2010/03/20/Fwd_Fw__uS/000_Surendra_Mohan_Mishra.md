Happy New Year 155 521 972 949 112!!!

If at the beginning of English year, we wished each other by saying  
�Happy New Year 2010�, then for this Hindu New year, the corresponding  
phrase will translate to above!

Surprised??

If you had a chance to pay attention to what a person performing any  
religious rite says in what is called as a Sankalpa, you would find  
that the person is actually describing the time elapsed since the dawn  
of Universe. The Sankalpa goes like this:

�Bhrahmane Dwitiyaparardhe, Shwetavarah kalpe,Vaivasvata Manvantare,  
Kaliyuge, Pratham Charane, Sarvadhari naam Samvatsare, Chaitramaase,  
Shukla Pakshe, Pratham tithau, Somvasare, JambuDweepe Bharat Khande,  
Bharat Varshe

Meaning:  
"Today, the second half of Brahma's life in Vaivaswat Manvantar and  
Shvetvarah Kalpa and the first part of Kaliyuga, in the year named  
Vikruti in the month of Chaitra in brighter half on first date in the  
holy land of Bharat in Jambudweep(Asia) This is of great significance  
for understanding the Hindu way of counting the age of universe. Here  
is the short glimpse.

The calculation of total time measured by Hindu calendar can be easily  
accomplished by replacing the terms used in the above sankalpa by the  
respective numerical equivalents. Yes, Dwitiya parardhe, Shwetavarah  
kalpe,Vaivasvata Manvantare, Kaliyuge, Pratham Charane etc terms  
signify some time associated with them.

  
Time Elapsed (In Years) Head Notes  
5,111 Kaliyug Total duration of Kaliyug = 4,32,000 years. After Mahabharat war  
38,88,000 Satya, Treta and Dwapar Yugs Satya, Treta and Dwapar are 4,3  
and 2 times of Kali Yug respectively.  
11,66,40,000 27 Mahayugs 1 Mahayug = Satya + Treta + Dwapar + Kali Yug.  
1,85,06,88,000 6 Manvantars 1 Manvantar = 71 Mahayug + 1 Satya Yug.  
17,28,000 Satyayug at the beginning of Kalpa 1 Kalpa = Brahma�s Half Day  
155520,00,00,00,000 50 Years of Brahma 1 Brahma�s Year = 360 Brahma�s Days  
1 Brahma�s Day = 2 Kalpas  
1 Kalpa = 14 Manvantar + 1 Satya Yug (= 1000 Mahayugs)  
155521,97,29,49,111  
Total

  
The coming year is 5112 in Kaliyug and is named �Vikruti�.

So Happy New Year155 521 972 949 112!!!
