Respected Scholars, Namaskar!

One simple question-

Why a letter of Sanskrit alphabet is called “Abhini&#351;&#355;&#257;na” ? (Apte Dictionary p.39).

Thanks. N. R. Joshi.

This e-mail is written first using Microsoft Word. On the menu bar, go to Insert. Pull down, go to Symbol. Click on it.  
It contains table of letters of alphabet with diacritical marks. Choose the modified letter you want. Click on insert at the bottom of the dialog box. Then click on close. You will find the letter with diacritical mark being inserted. Save the Microsoft Word file. Copy it and paste it in e-mail to bvparishat. This is the way I do it. There may be easy way to do it. Other scholars on this list may help you. Thanks for question. N.R.Joshi
