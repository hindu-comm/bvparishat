Namaste.  
  
The Vyashti-Samashti linkage cannot be better  
expressed than what is attempted in the Research  
Paper attached herewith. The You Tube video is in  
Tamil, being a clipping from Jaya T.V News item.  
  
In fact all the four Vedas are 'located' within our  
body which is a greater work done under the  
auspices of Maharshi Mahesh Yogi.  
  
I am yet to get the copy of the book  
as mentioned by Dr.Sathish Kumar  
during a chat on Yahoo.  
  
Pranams.
