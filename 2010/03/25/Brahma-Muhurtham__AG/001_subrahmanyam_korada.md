Dear sankar



aayusmaan bhava . The following write-up may help you --



Yaama means 3 hours of time . Raatri is called Triyaamaa (triyaamaa ksanadaa ksapaa - Amarakosah) .



One half of Yaama at the beginning and another at the end of Raatri is used for other work . Therefore,

if we take that the night starts at 7 PM then (by adding 9 hours ) it will be upto 4 AM . Generally 4 AM is

considered as Braahmamuhuurta .



Since Braahmii (Sarasvatii) wakes up at this time and as this time
causes waking up of Braahmii it is called Braahmamuhuurta -- here is Kulluukabhatta, a commentator on Bhrgu's Manusmrti

(4-92)-- braahmo muhuurto raatreh pascimo yaamah - braahmii bhaaratii tatprabodhahetutvaat .



Here the term Muhuurta means just Kaala (time) -- ibid - muhuurtasabdo'tra kaalavacanah .



So one (it can be practically observed - I did ) can grasp things at a high speed during this time .



Then it should be Braahmamuhuurta rather than Brahmamuhuurta ( or one has to resort to Laksanaa).



Here is Manusmrti (4-92, 93,94) --



braahme muhuurte budhyeta dharmaarthau caanucintayet I



kaayaklesaamsca tanmuulaan vedatattvaartameva ca II  


utthaayaavasyakam krtvaa krtasaucassamaahitah I



puurvaam sandhyaam japamstisthet svakaale caaparaam ciram II



rsayo diirghasabdhyatvaat diirghamaayuravaapnuyuh I



prajaam yasasca kiirtim ca brahmavarcasameva ca II



\- one should get up in braahmamuhuurta, should think about dharma and artha and the phisical difficulties

that are involved ( i.e. if the kaayaklesa is more and the result of such artha and dharma is less then give up).

think about Vedatattva as the Buddhi at that time is fresh (vedasya tattvaartham brahmakarmaatmakam

niscinuyaat -tasmin samaye buddhiprakaasaat- Comm).



-having got up ,finish the urgent ( toilets etc 13 are called Vegas in
Caraka- human beings often get health

problems due to holding back the Vegas) needs if demanded (sati vege - Comm) , have bath and follow

Yoga (Pranayaama etc. i.e. sandhyaavandanam) keep doing Japa (generally upto sunrise as Upasthaana

cannot be done before) for long and during Saayamsandhya also as per the time .

  
- due to diirghasanshya Rsis got good longevity, children, fame, popularity and Brahmavarcasam .



Here is Daksa --



pradosapascimau yaamau vedaabhyaasena tau nayet I



praharadvayam sayaano hi brahmabhuuyaaya kalpate II



\- the two Yaamas after Raatri one should spend by Vedaadhyayana . for two Yaamas ( 6 hours) one should

sleep -- by doing so one would get Brahmabhaava (brahmabhuuyam - kyap by - bhuvo bhaave, Panini3-1-107).



Here is Govindaraaja -- raatreh pascime muhuurte buddhyeta - one should wake up in the muhuurta after night.



Here is a verse from Raghuvamsa (5-36) --



braahme muhuurte kila tasya devii

kumaarakalpam susuve kumaaram I

atah pitaa brahmana eva naamnaa

tamaatmajanmaanamajam cakaara II



(Raghu's wife delivered a boy whowasalmost like Kumaarasvaami ( iisadasamaaptau kalpapdesyadesiiyarah - Panini 5-3-67), therefore the father named the son - ajah(Brahmaa) .



In Asvalayanagrhyasutra or in the following Parisista of Kumarilabhata the aspect is not touched.



In Jyotisagranthas such as Muhurtaratnavali, Pancangasarali, Muhurtadarpanam, Purusarthacintamani etc.

also it is not discused as there was no necessity .
