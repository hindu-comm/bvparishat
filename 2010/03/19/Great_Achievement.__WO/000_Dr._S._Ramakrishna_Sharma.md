Namaste, All.  
  
Proving the three fold possibilities of deriving the meaning  
of the Veda Mantras, Sri H.R Satishchandra of Hebbale,Hassn  
Dist. Karnataka has succeeded in creating the Vedic Static Alternator  
to generate electricity. He has decoded the Adhi-Bhoutika dimension of  
PURUSHA SUKTA and achieved this great feat.  
  
Here is an extract from his website.  
  
**"The Vedic static alternator has been patented as an offering at the lotus feet of Mother India.  
The next version was patented with Canadian research partners, when researchers noticed  
the similarities between the above mentioned principles, and pursued the concept further.  
The production based on both patents will start within one year in parallel in Bangalore, and  
in Niagara Regions in Canada and USA."**
