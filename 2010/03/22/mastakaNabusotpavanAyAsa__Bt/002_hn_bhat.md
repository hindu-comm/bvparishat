It seems to be right in the reading as it is. Thanks for the clarification. The explanation will be अस्ताः = निरस्ताःकणःयस्मिन्
\[बुसे\], अस्तकणः, बुसः, तस्य उत्पवनम्, तत्र आयास:. स एवायासो वा।

  

The above explains in a way the interpretation given by Saqdashivamurti.

It may mean also if the context needs, by the effort to separate them (utpavana), only grains are blown away and the husk only remains. Then also it will be only fruitless effort at all. This you can get by the sanskrit explanation I have offered if asta is taken as adjective/adverb for the act of utpavana. in the second explanation.

  

Only the context is the deciding factor to apply this idiom/phrase.

  

With regards.
