Namo Vidvadbhyah



I rather think what Sadasiva said is correct .



astaah nirastaah kanaah yasmaat sah busah, tasya utpavanam tena
aayaasah .



Patanajli offeres the following Vakya for dvistha ( having two meaning) - alambusaanaam yaataa .In the

second sense Alambusa is the name of a country .



Utpucchayate (tail ) - is the usage in Sanadyantadhatu -- pucchabhaandaciivaraannin (Panini 3-1-20) . The

Upasarga - ut - is in - raising / blowing etc. .



Here , since Pavana is associated with- ut - it is certainly blowing
with wind (suurpa is used in this activity).

Logically it is not possible to argue that utpavana of kanaah (grains) is possible from a blend of grains and

husk . At least in the present example - blow goes with husk ( yogyataa or compatibility) and not grains.



In case one wants to qualify utpavana with asta what will be the
Vigraha -- astam kanabusotpavanam ?



Samarthah padavidhih (Panini 2-1-1) -- asta has got saamarthya with kana rather than utpavana .



Asamarthasamaasa is not always acceptable . Gamakatvam is also not there .



Prakaranam (context) can be resorted to only in - sabdaarthasyaanavaccheda for visesasmrti (Hari -

Vakyakanda - Vakyapadiyam) , i.e if the meaning of a word cannot be decided (saindhavam aanaya ).
