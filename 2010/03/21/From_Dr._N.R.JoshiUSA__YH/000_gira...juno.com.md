Respected Scholars, Namaskar!

Can semantic patterns of letter-sounds be extended to Sanskrit grammatical endings and phonological changes?

I was asked to show that the semantic pattern (bow out) proposed by me for the retroflex letter-sound /ţ/ in Sanskrit lexemes works in the past passive participles like Bhraşţa, Naşţa etc.  
I wrote that I can do that if it was proved that the grammatical endings in Sanskrit remain unchanged over the period of three thousand years.

In the world there exist two views of Sanskrit.

The first view point: The Traditional  
This is the view point described by Dr. S. Korad in his posting of March 15. As always he explains his thoughts giving examples making all us grow rich in our knowledge of Sanskrit. He traces grammar to the very ancient deity (or sages) starting from Brahma. He says "there is no othergo but to accept that Sanskrit language is Anādi " (historically beginingless). This view point is called atemporal and ageographical where Sanskrit was created by Devatas and secrets of this eternal language is revealed to us by Yogi sages.

The second view point: Historical and Geographical  
According to this view point, the Sanskrit language, like all languages, developed and changed though time. It is known fact that at Pāņini’s time, the usage of Sanskrit was not homogeneous in different regions of the northern India. Copying the term from another scholar, it can be said that Pāņini was a frontier grammarian (Salātura) and his rules were meant to apply to a distinct regional dialect of Sanskrit and not to what we know now as Classical Sanskrit. According to this view Sanskrit penetrated gradually the northern India from the northwest regions to the regions of the east. This view point is called temporal and geographical.

No matter what view point one subscribes to, one cannot deny the existence of the large family of Indo-European languages. Traditionalists do not want to see outside of the subcontinent. Outsiders studying Sanskrit from secular point of view examine it for comparative linguistics, not for Dharma.

One thing is certain. Right from Brahma, Bŗhaspati down to Pāņini, all had vocal tract that can produce certain number of articulated sounds. This physical instrument is used in every language and thus plays basic roll in Vaikharī. That is where I focused my attention.

In one way this instrument is natural and it is Anādi. Thus my position on one hand supports traditionalists and on the other hand it supports historical developments due to the Principle of Least Efforts (generating Apaśabda from śabda) on the part of users.

However ancient Indian Sanskrit scholars have made great efforts to preserve Sanskrit lexemes with their meanings. On that assumption and on many other facts I tried to investigate semantic patterns associated with letter-sounds of Sanskrit.

Let us assume that Phonemic symbolism in Sanskrit does not work similar to the other languages like English. In that case how to explain the following case.

Two words: Pranāyaka (with dental /n/) and Praņāyaka (with retroflex /ņ/) have different meanings. Grammatical explanation: In the first word, Pra is nipāta, so it did not induce phonological change. In second word, it is Upasarga, and it induced phonological change. In my opinion, this is a grammatical observation. It does not explain change in meaning. The change of meaning must be assigned to the change of phoneme.  
There are many cases of phonological changes in Sanskrit. They involve changes in meanings. Thanks. N. R. Joshi.
