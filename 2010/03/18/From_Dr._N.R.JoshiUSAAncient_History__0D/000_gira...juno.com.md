Respected Scholars, Namaskar!

It was nice of Dr. Srisha Rao to bring to our attention the review of the book ,"Mathematics of India".

Last year I posted on this list "Tough Steel of India" .Around 1826 Michael Faraday (famous for electromagnetic induction) was on secret mission to find out the composition of steel (bulad) of Indian swords. He could not find it. The Russian scientist found it in 1850. Persian emperor Darius (526 BC approximate) was showing swords imported from India to his mother. I have published article on this.

The book of Dr. Frits Staal , "discovering of Vedas" offers wealth of information on Vedas and Sanskrit linguistics.

Two more topics need publicity-"Mahabharat and the Middle-East-ancient contacts of India to ancient Persia and Arabia" and "Internal Beauty of Sanskrit". Names of certain tribes from Mahabharat are mentioned in Old Testament. Remember there were no Ango-saxons on the world scene until 400 AD. But there was Persian Empire 900 years before. It is high time that to see the ancient history (before 500 BC) of India in the light of her connections to the ancient Middle-East countries. I have no problem with scholars with devotion to Puranic history. My experience tells me that books from world libraries offer wealth of information that make sense. Thanks. N.R.Joshi
