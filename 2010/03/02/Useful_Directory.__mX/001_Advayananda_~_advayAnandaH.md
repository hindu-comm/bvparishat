Dear Sreejith,  
Hari Om!  
  
This will be useful for other related links in CIF websites. Try to contact this person and find out if he can provide Sanskrit related sites also.He has given a few below his email. Which we can upload in the CIF website.  
  
Also try to find out from him if he has got the websites of these institutions. You may introduce yourself to him and thank him for providing this information.  
  
You can tell him that you got it forwarded from me and that I am part of the BV Parishad Google group.  
  
In Shri Guru Smriti,  
Advayananda
