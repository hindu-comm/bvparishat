Respected Scholars, Namaste!

I wish you all happy 2010 although this is not a new year day of many people. Few hundred years ago new year day in Europe used to come in March.

I thank Dr. Ramnath for bringing my attention to the book, "Dignaga on the Interpretation of Signs" author Richard P. Hayes.I remember I saw this book ten years ago but now I am reading again. First the book is good to understand ideas of Buddhist philosophers. Next on page 33 views of Radhika Herzberger,

"My thesis is that logical theory in India was an outgrowth of concerns with language. I argue that Indian logic had its origin in cross-currents between grammarian, Bhartrihari and a Buddhist philosopher, Dignaga, who took opposing positions on an aphorism concerning names that had been enunciated many centuries earlier by Katyayana".(This has to do with Sanskrit suffixes -TVA and -TAA)

I mentioned earlier that philosophy turned out to be a linguistic problem in ancient India. Ancient India faced two problems-origin of Sanskrit words and their meanings and second the history of Mahabharat. Vyaasa was contemporary of Mahabharat personalities. His name is important in connection with Vedas and Vedika history. Please add your comments so that we all grow in our knowledge of the ancient Indian culture.
