Very sad to listen this news. Very few scholars like Kolluri Somasekhara Sasry, Gopadev, Acharya pullela etc., tried to present the Telugu translations of sastric texts. Unfortunately, I did not get the darshan of Acarya Someswara Sarma garu but read an interview in The Hindu, published long ago. Learnt that He had been teaching even in his late eighties. It is a great loss to traditional Sanskrit scholarship. My humble homage to Him. JSRA Prasad
