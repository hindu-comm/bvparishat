Dear Scholars,  
  
Namaste. We are getting good response for our proposed national conference on '**Sanskrit Texts of AYURveda and YOGa and their Profound Global Significance',** which will be held between 21-22 March, 2010. Now, we want to clarify that this conference is not only limited to textual studies in ayurveda intertwined with yoga but also on applied aspects of these sciences. So, we request you to go through the themes mentioned in the announcement (file attached). You are welcome to send synopsis on any of the themes listed or related with. We are happy to say that owing to a good response, and many requests, we have extended the last date to submit abstracts till **29th of January, 2010**. Now, paper presenters are exempted from the registration fee of Rs. 500/ 250/- respectively. Feel free to contact in case of any clarification. Kindly inform the scholars/students those are interested.  
  
With regards,
