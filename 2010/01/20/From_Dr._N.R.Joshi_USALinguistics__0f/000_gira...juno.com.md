**Respected Scholars, Namaskar!**

**Speculations on Letter sounds in Sanskrit**

****

I would like to thank Dr. D. Bhattacharya for the valuable reference on retroflex sounds. I would like to thank Dr. Narang and Dr. S. Korad for valuable contribution to my postings from time to time.



We have seen speculations on letter sounds of English. It did not work. We have seen speculation on letter sounds in the ancient India. It was inconclusive. If one would like try once again speculations on letter sounds in Sanskrit, one has to look for both favorable and unfavorable aspects. First let us see **unfavorable points.**

(1) Sanskrit is very old language at least 2500 years old. According to information theory, information which is certain in the beginning tends to become uncertain with the passage of time. So sounds in Sanskrit words might have changed. Meanings of Sanskrit words might have undergone many changes.

(2) Many scholars even today believe that Sanskrit is one of the many languages derived from PIE. In the formation of Sanskrit words sounds from the ancient languages like Munda, Dravidian might have entered Sanskrit words,

(3) The origin of Sanskrit is lost in the fog of the prehistory of India. Indian scholars differ widely among themselves on the prehistory of India. In the epic Mahabharat, it was written that Vidura was talking to Pandavas (on the way to Laksha griha) in Mlenccha language. So even at that ancient time there were other languages along with Sanskrit. Mixture of languages is the common phenomenon in linguistics. There is therefore no such thing as all Sanskrit words to be pure and unadulterated.

(4) In the ancient India there used to be debate on the subject of derivation of Sanskrit words-not all words can be derived from Daatus.

(5) The principle of the least efforts works in all languages. People try to simplify pronunciation of difficult words by changing sounds. One can say that languages are evolving towards simpler forms.

(6) Grimm’s Law and Verner’s Law of sound changes seem to be applicable to Sanskrit also. The earlier “Shrishcate - - - -“is changed into “hrishcate - - - “

(7) In the phenomenon of Haplology, the loss of a form segment is possible. English adjective “gentle” does not become adverb “gentley” but it becomes “gently”. The same is true for “simple” and “simply”. Such losses may be present in Sanskrit words.

**Favorable Points**

(1) Indian Vedas held great respect and devotion in minds of the ancient Sanskrit scholars and Brahmin priests. They made every effort to preserve them using techniques like karma patha, jata patha etc.

(2) The ancient Shiksha and Pratishakyas were designed to maintain correct pronunciation of Sanskrit scriptures.

(3) Sanskrit spelling always reflected the sounds of pronunciation.

(4) There is a long tradition of Sanskrit grammarians before and after the celebrated grammarian Panini.

(5) For thousands of years, Sanskrit was and is the language of liturgy and hence correct mantra recitation was always stressed.

(6) For many centuries, Sanskrit was used in sciences like astronomy, mathematics, ayurveda, phonetics, vaastushastra, metallurgy, acoustics and in many other branches. Technical books are read by limited number of scholars and hence there is little possibility of undergoing changes in terminology from these books. This offers us a big collection of technical words unchanged from the ancient times.

(7) The most favorable point is that of Sanskrit VarNamaalaa which is unique among the alphabets of other world languages. It is matchless in its arrangement of VarNas according to articulation in human vocal tract. It is praised by modern linguists all over the world.



To proceed fresh on speculations on letter sounds, one needs a working hypothesis. It could be formulated as follows.

If two letter sounds are close to each other in acoustic space, they could carry semantics categories close to each other in semantic space.
In short the fixed semantic category of the letter sound /kh/ should be close to the fixed semantic category of the letter sound /k/. The same should be true for first two sounds from the row of retroflex sounds. There is one more problem. What is the key for decoding? Is there Sanketa for Viketana? And one more-what should be the starting point? More later on. Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
