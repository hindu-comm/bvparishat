dear all

happy birthday for bvp (born on 1.1.09, a little late wish, but still not too late).

it is one year since its inception. very good beginning. but still we have to go a long way. I invite all the esteemed members to help us with new ideas to enrich the BVP.



one more thing open for discussion is whether to admit non-indian-origin scholars to list. till the date only indian scholars are here. but now many scholars of non-indian-origin have requested for the membership. it is up to all you to decide.
