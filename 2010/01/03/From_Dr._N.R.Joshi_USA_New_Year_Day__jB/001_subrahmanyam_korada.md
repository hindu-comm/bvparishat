Dear Scholars



It is avicaaritaramaniiyam -- happy new year on 1st Jan.



How come the new year dawns at midnight ? What is the Pramaana? I mean to say -- the concept of Kaala

(alongwith dik and desa) is untenable . But for day to day transsactions it is required and therefore the

transit of Aditya and Candrama is followed.



In any case I am interested in neither receiving nor reciprocating such greetings. It is also not our culture and

such meaningless things are causisng misunderstandings (if forgotten by one to greet) among people.



thanking you
