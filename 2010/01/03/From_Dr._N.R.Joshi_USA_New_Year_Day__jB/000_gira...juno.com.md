Respected Scholars Namaskar!

This is in response to Shree Danush Mishra's posting suggesting us to say happy new year on Indian new year day and other days of significance. I admit that I am not an astrologer or astronomer. My information is from reading books and newspapers. Muslim Iran and Muslim Afghanistan celebrate their new year day on March 21 around the Vernal Equinox. Yugadi in India usually comes after 21st March when the moon joins the sun in Aries (New moon day). The next day is Ugadi. After six months on Deepavali new moon both the sun and the moon are in Libra sign. This is India's fiscal new year day. On this day under the sign Libra, business people balance their account books. The jewish calendar is like Hindu calendar-solar-lunar combined. Jewish Yom kippur and Hindu Dashahara (Vijaya Dashami) are the same day. However this combined caledar is 12 days short. So it needs an extra month after two and half years. Jewish way of adding extra month differs from that of Hindu. So one year Yom kippur and Dashahara come on the same day and next year one month apart. Before prophet of Islam Arabian calendar was like Hindu and Jewish-the combined luni-solar calendar. Sooften in the history Jewish Yom Kippur, Hindu Dashahara and Arabian Ashura (the tenth day of Moharam month) used to be the same day. When the prophet of Islam left Makka and reached Madina, Jews in Madina were celebrating Yom Kippur. Prophet told his followers that this was their Ashura day and recommended to keep fast on that day. According to preIslamic calendar, the month of Ramadan used to come in December just like Hindu Margashirsha month. So fasing was easy when days are short. In the later part of his life Prophet changed the calendar from luni-solar to lunar only. Now both Ashura and Ramadan started moving backward with respect to seasons. Arabs complained to prophet when Ramadan started coming in summer (days are 14 hours) in burning hot Arabia. Fasting became hard. Prophet gazed at the sky and replied, "people had misused the knowledge of calendar in the past. So I would like you to follow the lunar calendar". The sad part is now. Although the calendar was changed, Imam Husein (the grandson of the Prophet) was massacred on Ashura day. From that time the tenth day of Moharam, the Ashura day became a mourning day instead of an auspicious day.This year Dec. 27 was Ashura day. Each year Pakistani newspapers in USA published the information on holy Ashura day. The description fits exactly to Dashahara day-take bath, use new clothes, decorate ladies, etc.Prophet had given description how people of Khyber celebrated Ashura in ancient time. It is extremely rewarding to read the ancient history of Arabia. You will find El Dorado there.

The western calendar is completely screwed-up calendar. European new year few centuries back used to come in March(check-September 7th month etc). Gregory Pope added 10 days in October month and made January out of now where the first month. Jewish passover (Chatra Shuddha chaturdashi-one day before full moon-Jews escaped Egypt) never matches with this no-foundation calendar. This was going on from 400 AD but who is going to bell the cat? People are Gataanugatika. So all celebrate this no-foundation new year day Jan.1.Please correct me if I were wrong. Also pardon me please if I disturb sensibilities of anyone. Thanks. Happy 2010.
