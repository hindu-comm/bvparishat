Dear Sir,

I too had the similar questions while listeining to this speech. I  
wonder if it was a recording of the same speech by Swami Vivekanda..OR  
is it a remake ?

the owner of the webiste has to answer these questions.

warm regards,  
shrivara

\> Can the speech be in Vivekananda's own voice? Did recorders of any kind  
\> exist then? Is there any mention in contemporary accounts that a recording  
\> device was placed near Vivekananda or near the microphone delivering his  
\> voice to the audience (assuming microphones or something similar to them  
\> existed in 1893?) Have any recordings of other speakers at the Congress of  
\> World Religions come to light?  
\>  
\> The documentary division of the Govt of India produced at least one  
\> documentary on Swami Vivekananda. Could the voice we hear not be from an  
\> actor reading Vivekananda's speech? Has any contemporary given us  
\> information about Vivekananda's speech habits or accent?
