**Respected Scholars, Namaskar!**

**Alien version of Prehistory of India and Sanskrit**

**It took 100 hundred years for European scholars to admit their mistake of creating racial (Aryan versus Dravidian)theory of prehistory of India. (From the article of Dr.Trautman, Univ. of Michigan). People create languages. In the case of colonial India, European scholars created unknown (Aryan and Dravidian) people out of languages. Strange indeed! Although the racial theory of prehistory of India is dead, the other half (origin of Sanskrit) is still kicking. Dr. Trautman says he tells his students of Indian history that Sanskrit came to India from Iranian side. The theory of Sanskrit being one of the languages of Indo-European family and all wereborn from Proto-Indo-European(PIE). Although Pauranika evidence (as presented by Dr. Pandurangi about ancient people) may offer some information, one cannot ignore the archaeological evidence piling up every day from the countries on the western frontier of the subcontinent. Here is the example of Tokharian language discussed in USA. Can Indian Sanskrit scholars challenge the western theories of origin of Sanskrit? Late US scholar Whitney said the Sanskrit Lingual VarNas were accepted by Sanskrit from Dravidian languages of India. Is there any proof against it? Now you will understand my focus on the history of Mahabharat and research towards proving that Sanskrit is a special language. Repeatedly I was asking the question-show mesomething special in Sanskrit not present in other languages of Indo-European family.Thanks. N.R.Joshi.**

**Prehistoric Civilizations Around the Silk Road—The Evidence from the Tocharian Languages  
**Melanie Malzahn, University of Vienna and Visiting Professor, UCLA Program in Indo-European Studies

Among the extinct languages merely known by manuscripts discovered along the Silk Road, the two languages Tocharian A and Tocharian B together constitute one of the twelve branches of Indo-European. Mostly dating from the period of the 5./6. to the 8./9. centuries CE, the Tocharian texts give us an insight into the monastic Buddhist culture of their speakers. But these documents keep quiet about pre-Buddhist culture. Internal linguistic probing can shed some light on the prehistory of the two languages, and enables us to reconstruct a common ancestor, i.e., Proto-Tocharian. Comparative linguistics can further tell us something about the relationship of Proto-Tocharian to the other branches of Indo-European. One popular linguistic theory states that Tocharian—much like Anatolian—has a special status among IE languages by having branched off earlier from the common proto-language than all other branches such as Indo-Iranian, Greek, etc. However, recent research does not support this claim. In my view, the basic grammatical system and lexicon of Tocharian do not seem so much different from those of the other branches of Indo-European. On the other hand, Tocharian A and B show some clear traces of influence from other languages, most notably Iranian languages. Moreover, to a certain extent they must have even undergone some influence from non-IE languages—among them agglutinating ones—, but the details about which language and what period are again hard to determine. Hence, while Tocharian has a significant impact on the reconstruction of the grammar of the PIE proto-language, the contribution of linguistics to reconstructing prehistoric civilization is, above all, by its own nature severely limited
