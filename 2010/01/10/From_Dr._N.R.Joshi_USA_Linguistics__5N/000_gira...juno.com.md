Respected scholars, PraNAma!

**Speculations on Letter-sounds of Sanskritin ancient ****India****.**

****

(1) Alain Danielou in his book, “While the Gods Play” described efforts by Nandikeshvara in interpreting Shiva-sootras. However interpretations were broad.

(2) In the Ahirbudhnya-Sanhita of the Pancaratraagama, the seventeenth adhyaaya talks about VarNaSanjnyaanirUpaNa. In that chapter the letters of Sanskrit are assigned with certain categories including names of Devataas. Perhaps these might have Maantric significance. Or they might be for teaching proper pronunciation of words. With mantras one enters esoteric sciences difficult to probe into.

(3)Similar listing is found in the verses of the eighth chapter of Vishvamitra Sanhita. In the list, each letter of Sanskrit alphabet is associated with many categories. For example, three words ‘Karaala’, ‘Kamala, and ‘Brahma’ are given for the Devanagari letter ‘k’. Again the categories listed in front of a single letter are so varied that the purpose behind them is hard to judge.

(4) In Akshmama Upanishad, one finds similar descriptions. Sounds of ‘ kan’ (Kankaara), ‘kham’ (khankaara), ‘gam’ (gankaara) etc were associated with either Devataas or with their properties or with unrelated categories.

(5) It is known that Tantras try to associate certain categories (meanings) with the letters of Sanskrit alphabet. One finds speculations on meanings of Sanskrit VarNas in Kaamadhenu Tantra. Here again we come across Devatas associated with letters different from those mentioned above.

(6) It appears that linking Sanskrit language with metaphysics is an integral and powerful constituent of the ancient Indian culture and religion. It is also used as a nirvacana device. Sometimes an extreme form of nirvacana analysis is used based on the semantics of single sounds. This could be illustrated with the example of the nirvacana of the Tantric deity Bhairava given by Shivopadhyaya. He breaks the term ‘Bhairava’ into four syllables, /bha/, /ai/, /ra/ and /va/ and attaches meanings to them to get the meaning of the term, ‘Bhairava’. However these invented meanings of syllables do not work in other Sanskrit words. Such examples are unitary examples serving local purpose. Now it is true that in Sanskrit there are many single syllabic dhaatus and particles that carry semantic significance.

(7) In certain Yoga books, Devanagari letters are shown on petals of different chakras. For mundane purpose they do not serve any purpose because who knows what Yogi sees in his trance. That is personal experience.

(8) Did not Yask say ” one should try to stick to the rules of grammar as far as possible, but if this is of no avail in bringing out the hidden semantic content of a word, one should abandon them and proceed by analyzing on the basis of similarities in syllables and single sounds?”. (from the book “Indian semantic analysis, The nirvacana tradition” by Dr. Eivind Kahrs).

(9) It is well known that Sanskrit Vaiyakaranas deny semantic significance VarNas. (Example: YUpa, KUpa, RUpa).



Thus efforts of associating semantic significance with letter-sounds of Sanskrit are not unknown to the ancient Indian scholars. They tried individually and randomly without solid theoretical foundation. Are there similar efforts undertaken in modern times? There is nothing wrong in experimenting. What would be the objections to such efforts in new direction? I believe it may work if it gets some theoretical foundation. Such foundation may be found in the acoustic properties of Sanskrit VarNas. The Sanskrit VarNa SamAmnAya is very systematic and periodic in nature. If this system works, then Sanskrit upasargas may get fixed meanings based on the meanings of their constituent phonemes. At present Sanskrit dictionaries offer many meanings to a single upasarga like “Abhi”. Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
