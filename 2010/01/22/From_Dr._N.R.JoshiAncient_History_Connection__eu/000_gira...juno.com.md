Respected Scholars, Namaskar!

One golden city or two?

I read the paper of "Eric P. Hamp" on Retroflexes in Sanskrit (suggested by Dr. D. Bhattacharya).In that book the last paper (On the Two Great Indian Epics) is of Professor Sukumar Sen. The paper is full of details.There is always problem in case of Mahabharat-What was the original core and what was added later on to make it big.Looking from within the sub-continent, one gets one picture of Mahabharat. Looking outside of the sub-continent, one gets different picture of Mahabharat. Some people are content not to look outside. But then how to explain the facts-(1) Persian Empire of the known history,(2) The name of the European country Croatia (H' Rat)being derived from the word Saraswati,(3) River names of Lithuania same as river names of India, (4) Ladies Kingdom (Stree Rajya)in Chinese Eurasia, (5) Turkish people descendants of Wolf (Vrika), (6) Seven Saraswaties of Afghanistan, (7) Archaeological evidence that in the ancient times (2200 BC) people were moving from Asia to Europe (Dr. Gimbutas) and not from Europe to Asia.There is one more difficult puzzle. We all know Krishna and his people Yadavas ran away towards Gujarat from powerful Jarasandha of Magadha.And there they built golden city Dwaraka. In the ancient history of Saudi Arabia, one also comes across the story of golden city buried under the sand of that country.What is the guaranty that Yadavas of Mahabhrat stopped in Gujarat and did not go further in the west? There were two early civilizations in Saudi Arabia in the remote past.These questions can be explained if we extend Mahabharat boundaries beyond sub-continent.By doingso we may gain few things and may lose few things. Comments are appreciated. Thanks. N.R.Joshi.

Were there two Golden cities or One?
