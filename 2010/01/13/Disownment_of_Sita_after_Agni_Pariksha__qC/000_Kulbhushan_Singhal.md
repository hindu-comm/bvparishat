Sub: Disownment of Sita after Agni Pariksha  
WAS Shri Ram so ARROGANT that, after becoming king, he disowned Sita,  
inspite of Agni Pariksha?

Read full answer to this at my post : Agni Pariksh Of Sita… Facts  
Excerpts from my post Agni Pariksh Of Sita… Facts  
IT IS ALSO ABSOLUTELY CLEAR THAT SHRI RAM COULD NOT HAVE DISOWNED SITA  
WITHOUT REJECTING AGNI PARIKSHA. After becoming Chakravarti Samraat,  
Shri Ram ordained that humanity, present and future, would never ask  
any female to undergo this test. Perhaps this was the first Dharm of  
the much cherished RAMRAJYA. What were the other dharm, we would like  
to know.
