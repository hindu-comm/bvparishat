Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



**Sanskrit Lexemes (varNaatmaka shabda), words (Pada) and sentences (Vaakya)**

****

First I would like to thank Dr. Naranga suggesting the monosyllabic dictionary and referring to his interest in semantics. I would like to thank Dr, S. Korad for explaining the concept of VyaakaraNa which encompasses linguistic field greater than the word grammar. I thank him for discussing the difference between a saadhu shabda and asaadhu shabda. Shree Datta swami discussed earlier the difference between a Yougika shabda and a Yogaaroodha shabda. Finally I thank Dr. Ramanath Pandye for bringing my attention to the book of Richard Hayes on Dignaga.



In chapter 7 of this book, there is discussion on what exactly does a verbal symbol indicate? Is it particular, universal, relation or instantiation? There are discussions on synonyms, homomorphs and on one lexeme (like Aksha) with many meanings. There are discussions on Sanskrit lexemes Ghata and Ghatatva. Discussions on Ghata (jug), Pata (cloth), Neela Utpala are common in ancient discussions. Then there is conjecture about meanings of syllables ‘nee’ and ‘la’ in the lexeme ‘neela’ with neagative answer (syllables in this case have no meanings). However in Sanskrit there are many monosyllabic dhatus, and particles carrying semantic significance. In short Sanskrit lexemes (dictionary entries) have meanings, padas have meanings and sentences have meanings. When one makes a new sentence, he does not use available sentences to make new one but uses shabda , pada (which he learnt during language study) to make new sentences. Nobody denies the role of syntax and sandarbha in order to fix the proper meaning of a sentence without ambiguity. I mentioned in my earlier postings that I am interested only in Abhidhaa meanings of Sanskrit words. Compound words with compound concepts fall under the separate topic. We also discussed different views on meanings of words by different schools of Naiyayikas, Bhattas, Bauddhas (apoha theory) etc. There were discussions between Gargya and Shakatayana in ancient India.All (Vedic, Jainas, Bauddhas) were interested in Sanskrit shabdas and their meanings. Many books are published on this topic by many modern day scholars. They offer reviews of discussions over the past two thousand years of the history of India.



In my earlier posting I mentioned some western researchers speculated on meanings of letter-sounds. It did not work. However such speculations on letter-sounds were not unknown to the ancient Sanskrit scholars or philosophers or religious persons. We will talk about that in the next posting. Thanks. N.R.Joshi
