Respected Scholars, Namaste!

Indo-Asians before Indo-Europeans!

I read the book, "Indo-European Linguistics" edited by Dr. Satya Ranjan Banerjee (highly qualified professor of linguistics from Univ. of Calcutta). There are eight papers in the book. Out of eight seven papers are from the foreigners on Indo-European Linguistics. One paper is from Indian professor and that too on Ramayan and Mahabharat.The book is published in 1990. May I conclude that Indian mind is not much in Celtic and Gothic or PIE. It circles around Ramayan and Mahabharat either to prove it or disprove it. We get both types of papers. In the paper of Professor Edger Polome on p.58 there is reference to late archaeologist (Lithuanian) Marija Gimbutas. According to her research people were moving from Asia to Europe in the last half of the 4th millennium BC. I was saying this in my earlier postings. So the focus of Indo-European and Indo-Europeans is shifted from Carpathian mountains in Europe to Eurasia. It will eventually move to Asia. Was there any connection between Indo-Asians and history from the epic Mahabharat? Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
