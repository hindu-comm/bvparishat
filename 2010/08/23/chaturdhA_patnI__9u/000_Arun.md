Normally, all over the world, there has been pairs of husband-wife.  
Only the powerful and rich have kept more than one wife. Among them,  
Rāma has always been praised for having only one wife. In fact, all  
things were one-He used only one arrow (infallible) and spoke only one  
word (never backed out)-द्विशरं नाभि संधत्ते रामो द्विर्नाभिभाषते ।  
Koran has prescribed limit of 4 wives. Haters of Islam and the Prophet  
allege his personal life as reason of this rule. But that is only  
exception and the rules for fairness are more difficult in multiple  
marriages.  
In Vedic literature also, 4 wives have been indicated-Mahiṣī, Vāvātā,  
Parivṛktā, Pālāgalī. These words are not used in normal Sanskrit texts  
anywhere in India. It is possible that these may be in ancient Arabic  
due to which these have come in Koran. For wives, we are eager to  
prescribe 4 number. But in case of 4 husbands, we may accept that same  
husband may have 4 roles or wife may have 4 stages of relations with  
husband as indicated in Atharva-veda (14/2/3) which is called Vivāha  
sūkta. The whole chapter 14 relates to marriage. 4 husbands are-Soma  
(moon, calm or cool), Gandharva (experts in music), Agni (Agri =  
leader) and Manuṣya (man)-  
सोमस्य जाया प्रथमं गन्धर्वस्तेऽपरः पतिः । तृतीयो अग्निष्टे  
पतिस्तुरीयस्ते मनुष्यजाः ॥ (अथर्व १४/२/३)  
Some usage of words for 4 wives in Vedic literature are indicated  
here. All the 4 are used in Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (here Brāhmaṇa word  
means explanation, not any caste), chapters 13/4/1 and 13/5/2. Sāyaṇa  
has explained these rituals as per Kātyāyana śrauta sūtra (20/12)  
which has given meanings of these wives- Mahiṣī = first married wife,  
Vāvātā –kept in house (?), Parivṛktā = kept outside (deserted ?),  
Pālāgalī = daughter of messenger (?) Śrauta sūtra is method of  
rituals. Śānkhyāyana śrauta sūtra also describes it.  
चतस्रो जाया उपक्लृप्ता भवन्ति । महिषी वावाता परिवृक्ता पालागली । सर्वा  
निष्किण्योऽलङ्कृताः । मिथुनस्यैव सर्वत्वाय । (शतपथ ब्राह्मण १३/४/१/८)  
सायण भाष्य-चतस्रो भार्याः उप समीपे क्लृप्ताः स्थिताः भवन्ति । पालागली  
दूतदुहिता ।  
टिप्पणी-पत्न्यश्चायंत्यलङ्कृताः निष्किण्यो महिषी वावाता परिवृक्ता  
पालागलीति । (कात्यायन श्रौत सूत्र २०/१२)- प्रथम परिणीता पत्नी, वावाता  
वक्लमा, परिवृक्ता अवक्लमा, पालागली दूत पुत्री ।  
चतस्रश्च जायाः कुमारी पञ्चमी…..(शतपथ ब्राह्मण १३/५/२/१-८)  
Atharva-veda (20/128/10-11) is appendix (khila) called Kuntāpa sūkta.  
Kuntāpa is translated as gambler-Tāpa = heat or repenting like  
paśchāttāpa. But it should mean uncertainties in world due to which  
there cannot be a strict rule. Each rule has some exceptions to suite  
the society. Here too, Vāvātā means beyond the bounds of Father-in-law  
(śvasura), i.e. family. Parivṛktā means the opposite-under control of  
family. These indicate 2 aspects of wife-one is within the house and  
the other outside. Husband will have corresponding relations. Both  
ways, wife improves the family. Totā word is written here, not used  
anywhere else. Meaning of root verb Tu is to increase, move, harm.  
परिवृक्ता च महिषी स्वस्त्या च युधङ्गमः । अनाशुरश्चायामि तोता कल्पेषु  
सम्मिता ॥१०॥  
वावाता च महिषी स्वस्त्या च युधङ्गमः । श्वाशुरश्चायामि तोता कल्पेषु  
सम्मिता ॥११॥ (अथर्व २०/१२८)  
Some other usage of these words in vedic texts are given below-  
प्रास्मै गायत्रमर्चत वावातुर्यः पुरन्दरः । याभिः काण्वस्योप बर्हिरासदं  
यासद् वज्री भिनत् पुरः ॥ (ऋक् ८/१/८)  
आ त्वाद्यः सधस्तुतिं वावातुः सख्युरा गहि ।  
उपस्तुतिर्मघोनांप्रत्वावत्वधातेवश्मिसुष्टुतिम् ॥ (ऋक् ८/१/१६)  
या वा अपुत्रा पत्नी सा परिवृत्ती (परिवृक्ती)- (शतपथ ब्राह्मण  
५/३/१/१३)  
सुवरीति परिवृक्ती । (तैत्तिरीय ब्राह्मण ३/९/४/५)  
प्रहेयो वै पालागलो (दूतः) व्वानं वै प्रहित एति । (शतपथ ब्राह्मण  
५/३/१/१)  
यैव प्रथमा वित्ता (भार्य्या) सा महिषी । (शतपथ ब्राह्मण ६/५/३/१)  
महिषी धाय्या । (कौषीतकि ब्राह्मण १५/४) भुव इति वावाता (पत्नी) ।  
(तैत्तिरीय ब्राह्मण ३/९/४/५)  
तष्टासि तृष्टिका विषा विषातक्यसि । परिवृक्ता यथा सस्यृषभस्य वशेव ॥  
(अथर्व ७/११३/२)  
परिवक्ते पति विद्यमानट् (ऋक् १०/१०२/११) सं ते वावाता जरतामियं गीः  
(ऋक् ४/४/८)  
Analysis of these indicate that, role of wife has been divided into 4  
aspects-like 4 varṇas (grades of persons) or 4 āśramas (stages of  
human life). These aspects of wife has the meanings- Mahiṣī =  
controller of house (mistress). Vāvātā = role in the house, Parivṛktā  
= role outside house, Pālāgalī = link in the family. In this sense,  
wife is called Vadhū = which binds the family.
