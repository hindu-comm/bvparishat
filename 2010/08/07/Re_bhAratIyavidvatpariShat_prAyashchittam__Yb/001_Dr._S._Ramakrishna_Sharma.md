पुज्यपुजाव्यतिक्रम : न कदापि भूयादिति आत्मानं  
स्मारयन् ,  
सर्वेभ्यो महद्भ्यो नत्वा,  
Moral Science(introduced in/by the Christian Mission Schools),  
Ethics,Civics and allied Etiquette, Manners(Table(!) Manners included)  
and such elements of civilization, training in these areas to make the citizen  
a true citizen are utterly inadequate to meet the standards of refined Indian sensibility,  
aesthetic sense and purushartha oriented spiritual values under the broad spectrum  
"Sanatana Dharma".  
By drawing references from the unparalleled resources of inexhaustible Srimad Ramayanam  
and Sriman Mahabharatam Sri JSRA Prasad has brought to fore the need for revamping the  
KG to PG Syllabi across the nation for providing reorientation towards the Indian Standards  
mentioned above. How many of our primary school teachers know the anything about our  
Epics?  
Infect and kill the language and destroy the culture, Science and Spirituality - with this ulterior  
motto the outsiders have done irreparable damage to our culture. Before the roots are lost  
we must create an online platform for OER(Open/Online Educational Resources) in WikiEducator  
and such free forums to gather the required resources as being done here in and through  
the discussions under varied heads/posts.  
**On the occasion of Samskruta-VarAcharaNam, such an endeavour would be befitting service  
to our culture.**  
**ऋणत्रयं अपाकृत्य मनो मोक्षे निवेशयेत्**  
The spirit of this post, albeit its apparent irrelevance, if any, be taken into account  
and मय अल्ल् support the campaign for creating Online Resources relevant to our culture.  
जयतु संस्कृतं !जयतु भारतं!! जयतु भारतीयविद्वत्परिषत् !!!
