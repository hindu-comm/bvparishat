Dears,  
  
One of our student want to edit Alankaara-chandrikaa commentary on Chandraaloka, by Vaidyanatha/Vidyanath. Can anybody have details of this work and the other? Whether it is published or not?  
  
He has the info that Mysore ORI has a couple of good manuscripts of the work. Before proceeding further he wants to get the clarification.  
  
Thanks in advance
