It has been published many years ago by Venkateshwara Steam Press and later by Nirnaya Sagar Press and one edition with Hindi Commentarly from Chowkhambha. (I am quoting from memory and hence I do not have the details of publications year etc.). I had a copy but right now I could not locate it for referring.

  

May be some member come up with details of any critical edition (if undertaken), I hope not yet done.

  

I learnt Kuvalayananda with Alankarachandrica mentioned first above.

  

Its Vaidyanatha Payagunde, a student of Nagoji bhatta, if my memory is right. There should be some other commentaries also by the same scholar in different subjects possibly in grammar.

  

A critical edition is most welcome using all the available manuscripts. A very standard commentary on Kuvalayanada explaining the ideas in Shastraic style.

  

With regards
