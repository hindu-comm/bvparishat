I rechecked Katre. As far as I could determine, he does not say that the accents appearing in his printing of the sutras were the accents heard in Paa.nini's own speech or were the accents employed by Paa.nini to mark anuvartaniiya words etc. -- that is, were metalinguistically used accents.

  

On p. xi, he explains the marks he uses for udaatta and svarita (and he clarifies that he leaves the anudaatta unmarked).

  

On p. xxiii, he informs his readers that the tradition of marking the anuvartaniiya words with the svarita accent "seems to have been broken at some time, since by the time Kaa;sikaa came to be composed, this accentuation system was no longer current."

  

On pp. xxiv-xxv, he writes, "Paa.nini's language \[= probably the language found or originally expected to be found in the A.s.taadhyaayii\] is characterized by accents which are suprasegmental phonemes. In later days this seems to have been lost, even at the time of Pata;njali. Later grammatical systems have little to say about accents. Paa.nini's rule 6.1.158 definitely shows that each pada or finished word had its own accent which he tries to describe in chapter 6. In the illustrations given in this work \[= Katre's edition\] due care has been taken to show the pada accent even when sentences are given as illustrations, and sentence accent is indicated only in the section which deals with sentences specifically in the A.s.t." The next paragraph gives details of how affixes with the markers attached to them inform the A.s.t users about the accents of the padas. Further clarification is found on pp. xli-xliv, which also give evidence of loss of semantically significant accentuation in the time between Paa.nini and Pata;njali.

  

The question originally asked was, as I understood it to be, about the accentuation in/of the suutra-paa.tha, not about the accents of the resultant words (which one could take as indicative of the accents found in Paa.nini's own speech and of the accents found in those suutra padas which did not guide the application of the suutras). What Katre seems to have done is to give accents of the resultant words found in the suutras (and, maybe, of some homophonous affixes). This is certainly useful to the anticipated readership of his edition, namely linguists who are not Sanskritists, but is not the same as giving an accented suutra-paa.tha.
