Thanks for reminding of Katre's Edition of Ashtadhyayi. I remember it having accents noted in the Roman Transliterated text, a copy of which I had with me, (but now lost). I don't know whether a Devanagari Edition was published ever of the same.

  

I will check up with my collection and get it scanned if still available, for those interested if any. Please not that it is in Roman Transliteration and not in Devanagari script.
