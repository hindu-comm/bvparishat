I am sorry I left out an important unit in the verse in my previous message. The form of the महः is the elephant in the face and human in the trunk. I felt I missed something, but could not realize what it is.
It cann't be said either Nara or kunjara exclusively. So it is kimapi.

  

मन्महे = आद्रियामहे, बहुमन्यामहे in the case of Luster or Light; In the case of Luster, ध्यायामः = we contemplate upon.

  

We seek light (from fire) to drive away darkness from our houses and in the similar way to drive away darkness of ignorance in the form of Vighna-s. The remaining is the same adjective applied to both.

  

If any point is left out, I will mend it if pointed out.

  

With regards
