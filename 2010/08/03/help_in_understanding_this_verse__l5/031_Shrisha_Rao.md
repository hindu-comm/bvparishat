The accents for the Sāma Veda have been lost since at least the time of Kumārila Bhaṭṭa (7th cent. CE?), who mentions their loss. I remember reading that there was a 19th-cent. scholar who tried to restore them (on what basis, I do not know). In general, the Sāma Veda traditions have perhaps fared the worst of all for a long time now; even the ancient चरणव्यूह states that most of them were destroyed in antiquity, and suggests that improper practice on the part of their adherents was the reason: सामवेदस्य किल सहस्रभेदा आसीदनध्यायेष्वधीयानास्ते शतक्रतुवज्रेणाभिहताः प्रणष्टाः । शेषान् प्रवक्ष्यामि -- असुरायणीया, वासुरायणीया, वार्तान्तरेयाः, प्राञ्जलऋग्वैनविधा, प्राचीनयोग्याः, राणायनीयाश्चेति ...
