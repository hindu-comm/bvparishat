Thanks for this interesting piece of information and also for the contact details of the person under whose guidance the version was prepared.

On another list I provided the following information on 15 Feb 2003:

\>An accented text of the A.s.taadhyaayii is printed at the end of: Dahiya, Yajanveer.1995. Paa.nini as a Linguist: Ideas and Patterns. Delhi: Eastern Book Linkers. This book is written in problematic English. The author's logic is frequently not clear. His remark on p. 213 ("I have, therefore, marked the accent in the original text of the AP \[= A.s.taadhyaayii of Paa.nini\]) may be interpreted to mean that the author reconstructed the accents (lost, in his view, by Pata;njali's time). However, the remark does not rule out the possibility that he (Dahiya) borrowed the marks from some other printed or manuscript source known to him.\<

The da;sa-granthii Brahmins used to recite the A.s.taadhyaayii and Nirukta as parts of the Vedaa:ngas. The last such recitation I (partly) heard was in 1972. I do not know if any such reciters still exist. If they do, one should make clear recordings of their Vedaa:nga recitations. It may turn out that these Brahmins have not preserved the original accents of the texts but have simply applied the Veda accentuation familiar to them to the Vedaa:nga texts.\*\* It may also be the case that the only recitation they know is eka-;sruti ('uni-tone,' which type of recitation was allowed for svaadhyaaya). In any case, a clear record needs to be made before the tradition completely disappears.

\[\*\* It is said that the \*original\* accentuation of the Atharva-veda has not been preserved anywhere in India. What is heard is really ,Rgvedic accentuation applied to the Atharva-veda.\]

One must proceed in the study of A.s.taadhyaayii accentuation by keeping different possibilities in mind. Some of these are indicated in the preceding lines. Another possibility is that some accentuation found in the suutras may have a metalinguistic purpose (in accordance with such stipulations as svaritenaadhikaara.h; cf. Cardona, George. 1968. "Paa.nini's definition, description and use of svarita." In Pratidaanam ..., pp. 448-461; the particulars of the volume are: Pratidanam: Indian, Iranian, and Indo-European studies presented to Franciscus Bernardus Jacobus Kuiper on his sixtieth birthday. Edited by J.C. Heesterman, G.H. Schokker \[and\] V.I. Subramoniam. The Hague Mouton 1968.) In other words, the accents used in the A.s.taadhyaayii may not be identical with the accents in Paa.nini's spoken Skt.

The mention of Paa.nini-mandira in Dr. Singh's post reminds me of Paa.nini statue. Several years ago I heard that, in response to questions of tourists / scholarly visitors to the Lahore area, the residents of a village near Lahore or a suburb of Lahore had begun to point to a Paa.nini statue (Because Paa.nini is spoken of as ;Saalaaturiiya and some modern scholars have placed ;Salaatura near modern Lahore, the visitors are thought to have made inquiries, upon reaching Lahore, about where Paa.nini was born.) Has anyone actually seen such a stature? Did it exist before the Partition (Lahore was a strong centre of Sanskritic learning before the Partition, and it is not implausible that someone thought of erecting a Paa.nini statue. Nor is it implausible that someone has faked a Paa.nini statue to attract tourist money.)
