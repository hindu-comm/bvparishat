Thanks Narayanan for the translatin.

  

I was about to reply, but it is already there.

  

Let us wait if any more explanation is sought by the member. This is the first verse I read when I plunged into the domain of Sanskrit with Mallinatha as my Guru and yet live in my mind. Happy to see it translated here.

  

May be some more moderation may be needed to be closer to the text. Generally conveys the idea of the verse.

  

Thanking once again
