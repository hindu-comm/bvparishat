I send a modified version by appreciating the corrections from the scholars.

  
  
  
अन्तरायतिमिरोपशान्तये शान्तपावनमचिन्त्यवैभवम्।  
तन्नरं वपुषि कुञ्जरं मुखे मन्महे किमपि तुन्दिलं मह:।।  
  

शान्तपावनम् , अचिन्त्यवैभवं, मुखे कुञ्जरं , वपुषि नरं, किमपि तुन्दिलं तत् मह:, अन्तरायतिमिरोपशान्तये, मन्महे।  
  
  

We think about the great figure, to wipe out the obstacle of darkness (ignorance), whose head is that of an elephant and whose abdominal body is that of human being ( Lord Ganesha), whose great halo which is hard to express by words, sedately sanctified and having unimaginable influence.
