'yadi hi bhedakA gunAh syuh udAttamevoccArayet' (VrddhirAdaic 1-1-1) , udAttanipAtanam karisyate (tricaruroh, 7-2-99

and caturassasi, 6-1-161) - these remarks of **Patanjali** support that
there was **Traisvaryam** in **Astadhyayi** .



The word ' **aiksvAka** ' in ' **dAndinAyana** .... (6-4-174) is pronounced with **Ekasruti** - according to **Patanjali .**



The term **Svarita** in **SvaritenAdhikArah** (1-3-11) means a **Varnadosa** and not the **Svarita** that is **PAribhAsika** . In that case,since **PAribhAsikasvarita** is compatible only with '**ac**'
there will be problem in cases like 'sa **rasAbhyAm no nah** **samAnapade**, (8-4-1) , where '**na**' has got **Svarita** (Following **svarito nAma svaradoso varnadharmah - KAsikA) .**



Following, **'VibhAsA chandasi'** (1-2-36) , **Ekasruti** is '**optional**" . Then the **UdAttoccAranam** by **AcArya** in certain places is for '**VivaksA**' .  
  
By and large , it is , as per the literature (Mahabhasyam etc.) available, difficult to decide as to whether Panini pronounced the entire **Astadhyayi** with **'Traisvaryam' or 'Ekasruti' .**



The SUtra , **'vibhAsA chandasi'** (1-2-36 ) is for **VyavasthitavibhAsA** - **BAhvrcas** recite **SamhitA** with **Traisvaryam and BrAhmana with Ekasrti .**



I, as a **TaittirIya** ,recite both **SamhitA and BrAhmana** with **Traisvaryam .**
