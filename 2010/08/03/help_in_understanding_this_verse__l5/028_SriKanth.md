Pardon my pestering with questions.  
  
I came across the phrase "Vaidagdhya bhangi bhaniti" while reading  
about an overview of Vakrokti. With help of dictionary, I could make  
out Vaidagdhya means cleverness. I couldn't make out the others.  
  
Could you help me understand the phrase. I am much obliged to this  
group.  
  
Thanks,  
Srikanth.
