Thank you sir. 18 and 21 are the ages for girls and boys to become majors legally, now.  
It is interesting to see that the scope of *balatva* in terms of age is not clear in our scriptures.  
My assumption can be corrected. Kautilya had mentioned *prapta vyavhara* (major), but not the age.  
The same is with *daya vibhaga* in his treatise.  
  
In sastras, it is clear for us, how the word *bala* is defined.  
  
With warm regards,  
Prasad
