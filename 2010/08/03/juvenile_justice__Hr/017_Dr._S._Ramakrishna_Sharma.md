नमांसि

  
\>it is not clear whether it excludes him Prayaschitta

I admit that it requires clarification.

However, before attempting it, I would like to bring in

the concepts associated with"Prayaschitta".

1\) Among the five types of Karmas scripturally classified:

**Nitya-Naimittika-Kamya-Prayaschitta** and **Nishiddha,**

the first four are to be followed and the last one has

to be recognizedand discriminatively eschued.

These are the fiveKarmas in the context of individual's **personal life**.

This does not have direct social context.

**तस्मात् शास्त्रं प्रमाणं ते** is a matter of shraddha.

What is the impact of the above on the society? If any, may be

discussed in another context/heading.

2\) पश्चात्तापं विना प्राय्श्चित्तस्य अवकाशो नास्ति । अपि च,

पापभीतिरेवद्वयोरपि कारणं ।

Danda in the modern sense does not recognize the

sin factor, though while swearing, the Religious Texts

are held in high esteem to switch on the prick of conscience.  
3) प्रायश्चित्तम् facilitates enlightening and educating the conscience

and ensures non-corrupt vasanas/samskaras.

In the light of the above points, to some extend the modern rehabilitaion

attempts and post-punishment/ in-prison-good-conduct-entries have

this aspect of prayashitta in the background.

Danda and Prayaschitta ought not to be out of proportion to

the crime/sin committed. While the former is debatable, the latter is

followed strictly according to the scriptural injunctions.

While the Raja deals with the Raja-Danda, it is the Guru who deals

with the prescription of Prayaschitta. Divine interventions are also found

in the Puranic episodes and Sthala-Puranas.

Dharma Jijnasais the means which perhaps takes care of both Danda

and Prayschitta. Karmavichikitsa seeks answers from the Shrotriyas.

So is this post, observations/comments from the esteemed scholars.
