Just I finished reading the different opinions on the concept of Bala and juvanille offence. Very clearly the outlines were drawn. As I summ it up in a nutshell,

  

There is no second opinion that term*bala*is applied to a person till he attains the age of 16 years. Ashodashaad bhaved baalaH.

  

The other the concept of juvanille offence which was intended to be the main topic of this discussion, somehow lost sight mingled with that of Prayashcitta (related mainly with Dharma-shastra) and Danda (related with Niti-shastra). Prayashcitta can be said to be the Danda imposed by the rule maker vidhi= makers The Veda-s, and the sages for their implementation providing guidelines for it in case it is violated. Danda, in its criminal aspect, is imposed by the social rule makers and those who are responsible for their implementation. One is in the case of ritual obligations violated and in the other the social obligations violated. Implementation of punishment becomes necessary for maintaining law and order in the state as the King is also responsible to see that VarNashrama-Dharma-s are not violated (as I remember having read so, I am not sure).

  

A hard and fast distinction may not be possible, but an attempt can be made as Dr. Sadashivamurthy suggested. Madhavyopakhyana is cited as an example for the exemption of juvanille offenders in Indian tradition also. The story has more things in the background, and Dr.Ramakrishna has cited only relevant portion which at the outset related to any offence or crime committed and it is not clear whether it excludes him Prayaschitta (which is not the point raised mainly here) and is a different thing.

  

Hope this will be taken up further as someone has suggested the formation of a forum for discussing this point further with scholarly outcome intended.  
  
With regards
