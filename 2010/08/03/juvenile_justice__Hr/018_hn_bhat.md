Among the five types of Karmasscripturally classified:

**Nitya-Naimittika-Kamya-Prayaschitta**and**Nishiddha,**

**  
**

**Thanks for the clarification to some extent.**

**  
**

**There is some descrimination between the karma-s stated above. "Nitya" is obligatory and "Naimittika" is obligatory to be observed on special occasions "nimitta". The remaining Kamya-karma-s are optional.**

**  
**

**With Nitya, if you do not observe, pratyavaya is entailed and it is the definition, even though there is no specific fruit to be obtained by observation.**

**"Naimittika" doesn't entail *pratyavaya*if not observed, but entails fruits if observed.**

**  
**

**Prayaschitta- is meant to compensate for any lapse in the two karma-s and if there is no lapse, it is not needed and the last one is to be avoided at all.**

**  
**

**Shynayaga- is prescribed by the scriptures, but it is to be avoided to avert the himsa caused by taking away another's life through abhichara, and not the killing of shyena in the yaga is considered as *hima* by itself as it is prescribed by the injunctions for the Yaga. It is a different kind of discussion.**

**  
**

**Prayaschitta- covers any lapse in the observation or non-observation of any of these. Hence it needs to be distinguished from Danda, which is exclusively the subject of Niti-shastra.****I don't think any conflation of these two concepts is tenable, though both can be discussed at length by those interested under different topics for clarity and avoid confusion as pointed out by Rani Sadashivamurthy.**

**  
**

***अदण्ड्यान्*दण्ड्यन् राजा दण्ड्यांश्चैवाप्य दण्ड्यन् ।**

**अयशो महदाप्नोति नरकं चैव गच्छति ॥**

  

Manu includes Danda as the exclusive right of the King.
