**Dear Sir,  
Namaskar.  
If Dr Mathur whom you have just introduced to the BVP is a scholar of DharmashAstra,from him and others like you I would like to know as to how much is there in DharmashAstra to support or justify a Pratiloma VivAha.This is a long standing query with me which I could not place before a forum better than the BVP.  
Regards,  
S M Mishra**
