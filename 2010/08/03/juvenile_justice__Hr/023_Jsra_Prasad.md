Dear Sir,  
  
Respected Prof. H.N. Bhat has very succinctly put the entire story of AnImandavya briefly in another thread. As Prof. S. Ramakrishna garu mentioned, it is Mandavya rishi whose name is prefixed with the adjective 'अणी' (= शूलाग्रम् इति) since tip of that trident could not be removed from his body. The *loukika* reason for this punishment goes like this - Some thieves have stolen wealth from the king's treasury. Thinking that the rishi is involved in the theft the king summoned to punish him with the शूलारोप । Further, by the curse of the rishi Yama Dharmaraja incarnated as Vidura who is second to none in devotion and knowledge. The context is of a dialog is between Janamejaya and Vaisampayana.  
  
Thanks,  
Prasad
