Dear Sadasivamuty,  
Let me introduce myself. I am Tushar K.Sarkar-- a retired professor of philosophy, Jadavpur University, Kolkata & later an Adjunct Visiting Prof. of U of Waterloo, Canada. Presently I live in Canada. I have been following the discussions (on bvparisat site) on punishment of juvenile criminals, with keen interest. I fully agree with you that the cases of 'prayaschitta' & punishing criminal actions are basically different issues &must not be confused.Your quotations from Ramayana are interesting too. There is a lot of discussion that's going on here two areas (among others)viz.,a) theoriesof punishment & its purpose (why punish', b)how to criminal responsibilityfor an offence, but nobody hereseems to be aware that the Indiantradition/philosophy may have any relevant insight to offerin this context. I think it is at least worth exploring the possibility seriously. Clearly,it needs a lot of scholarship & teamwork. So,I am tryingto organize a group of young & energetic scholars like you,who may be interested in setting up a forum for serious cooperative researchin the area. At this time, I am planning to contact a few others too for this purpose. **If** you feel seriously interested, please contact me. If **NOT**, you mayjust *ignore* this mail. Feel no obligation to respond. Thanks.  
  

Professor Tushar K.Sarkar.
