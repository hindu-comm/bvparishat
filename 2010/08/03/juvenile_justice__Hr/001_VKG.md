Pranaam!  
Many Dharma Sastra Granthas, mention the multitude of mistakes done in  
Brahmacharya (Which is deemed to be youth/ childhood). And many  
Praayaschittas are imposed for corrective measure.

Regarding, the mistakes of girls too, innumerable references are  
provided; making the parents too equally responsible. (Where as in the  
case of the boy, the Guru Kula/ Father are responsible)>

Regards  
Vamshi
