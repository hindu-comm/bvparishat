\> \>\> the fruits of his past deeds. But where he enjoys the fruits depends on the  
\> \>\> type of deed he performs (. If he performs a highly pious deed which is  
\> \>\> capable of bringing forth enjoyment in Heaven, he is taken to Heaven to let  
\> \>\> him enjoy the fruit. If it is an ordinary pious deed which brings forth  
\> \>\> happiness in this world itself, he enjoys the fruits in the next birth in  
\> \>\> the martya loka. Same with papa phala also.
