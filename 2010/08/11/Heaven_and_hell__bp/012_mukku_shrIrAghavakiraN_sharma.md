नमांसि वंशीकृष्णाय घनपाठिनः

  

Thank you for the clarification.Whatever the "mortal body" or *sthoola sareera* can experience will be experienced by it, and whatever is beyond its experiences is experienced by *sthoola* and *bhoga* *sareera*s.

  

You referred to this mortal body as*sthoola sareera.*How many such*sareera*s exist for an individual?Do you mean to say that the others mentioned (*sookshma* and *bhoga sareera*s) are immortal?Is it because they are immortal that it is they which carry the *vaasana*s from the previous birth? Are these immortal only till one attains *moksha*?Can you please suggest me any book to read in this regard?

  

As far as I can understand, till one realizes that one and One are the same, the world is real.
