Dear Raghu Kiran,  
 Just my two cents. Elders may correct. It is true that a person reaps the fruits of his past deeds. But where he enjoys the fruits depends on the type of deed he performs (. If he performs a highly pious deed which is capable of bringing forth enjoyment in Heaven, he is taken to Heaven to let him enjoy the fruit. If it is an ordinary pious deed which brings forth happiness in this world itself, he enjoys the fruits in the next birth in the martya loka. Same with papa phala also.  
  
हरये नमः  
राचूरि आचार्य  
मम स्वामी हरिर्नित्यं सर्वस्य पतिरेव च ।  
त्वमस्माकं तवस्मसि
