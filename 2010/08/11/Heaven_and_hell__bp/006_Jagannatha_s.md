Prof.Sadashivamurthy Rane's statement ‘‘Many things in this vast Universe are beyond our purview and far away from our experience. We cannot simply deny whichever is out of the domain of our perception’’

is confirmed by a half verse:

अचिन्त्याः खलु ये भावा न तांस्तर्केण योजयेत्।

I can not remember exactly where this half verse has come from. I request the scholars to enlighten me.
