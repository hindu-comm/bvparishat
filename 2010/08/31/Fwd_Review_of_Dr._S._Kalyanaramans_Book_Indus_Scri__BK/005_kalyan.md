<https://sites.google.com/site/kalyan97/indus-script-cipher> This page  
links to reviews of the book, Indus Script Cipher by Prof. Shivaji  
Singh, Prof. TR Narasimha Rao, Dr. Vijaya Rajiva, Dr. Kamlesh Kapur,  
Smt. Giti Thadani and my notes on some comments with links to Indian  
Lexicon and the intro of the Lexicon. I will be happy to add all  
critiques and reviews on this page.  
  
A copy of the introduction to the 2500 page Indian Lexicon may be seen  
for a reference to the historical context for the formation and  
evolution of Indian languages. Pages 267 to 292 of Indian Lexicon:  
Introduction. May be downloaded/read at <http://www.docstoc.com/docs/52936775/introlexicon>  
  
a. The multi-lingual Indian Lexicon is available for search by any  
word in any language, downloadable/can be read athttp://[www.scribd.com/doc/2232617/lexicon](http://www.scribd.com/doc/2232617/lexicon)  
  
b. A book review by V. Sundaram of the Indian Lexicon (6 pages) is at  
<http://www.docstoc.com/docs/50190786/Indian-Lexicon>  
  
I hope the work will promote further studies in the evolution of  
Indian languages,  
  
There is no invocation of Brahui. On the contrary, a number of  
semantic clusters are cited from ALL Indian languages to establish the  
sprachbund (language union or Indian linguistic area of all language  
families).  
  
I repudiate and disagree with Asko Parpola's claim. I have also given  
reasons why I disagree with his and Iravatham Mahadevan's 'readings'.  
I do not know if there is any reference to the pictorial motifs or  
field symbols -- svastika, standard device, fish etc. -- in their  
works nor to the continued use of hieroglyphs in the Indian tradition  
(e.g. Sohgaura copper plate, Rampurva copper bolt, tens of thousands  
of punch-marked coins, sculptures of Bharhut, Sanchi, glyphs on Jaina  
aayaagapaTTas and in Khandagiri caves).

PS. The book is available on Amazon, Barnes & Noble and Borders.  
Hopefully, an Indian edition will come out soon.
