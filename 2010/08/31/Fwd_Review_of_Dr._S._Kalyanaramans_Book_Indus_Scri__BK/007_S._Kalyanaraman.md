धन्योस्मि

धन्यवादःकल्याणरामन

  

Respected Prof. Makkhan Lal ji,

  

I have arranged to send 2 copies to your address. I will also send to Prof. Bhagwan Singh ji, as soon as I get his address.

  

I wish many children get interested in language studies. We are inheritors of such a treasure of works in languages, e.g. Bharata's Natya Shastra, Bhartrhari's Vaakyapadeeya, Patanjali's Mahabhashya (apart from Panini's Ashthaddhyayi), Hemachandra Acharya's Deshi naamamaalaa (Prakrt grammar), scores of Nighantus. Now many of our language dictionaries are also available online. There is also a need to promote researches into our vishwakarma traditions. Ours is a cultural continuum which saw hundreds of mints from Takshashila to Karur producing punch-marked coins from ca. 1000 BCE (pace Prof. DR Bhandarkar's lecture on Numismatics).
