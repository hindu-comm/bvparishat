 Sri Bhagwan Singh is right. There is no methodology or even an attempt at a historical context. Bruahi is invoked but there is no evidence of its existence before the Medieval period.



 Also, there is no attempt at comaparative palaeography. No comparison with Brahmi or other ancient scripts.



 Even if you disagree with what Jha and I have done in our book, we have given a historical context, placing the Harappans in the post-Vedic period.



 The author seems to accept Parpola's Dravidian hypothesis. If Dravidian politicians who paid Parpola can claim archaeological remains in Punjab-Haryana as the creation of their ancestors, Akali politicians can claim Mahabalipuram, Rameshwaram etc as the work of their Sardarji ancestors.



 If the Harappan language was proto-Tamil, the language old Tamil nadu inscriptions must be proto-Punjabi.



 I am rewriting the book. The writing is important for it was the seed of later India and Southeast Asian writing.



 I am giving several talks on this in Europe, U.K. and the U.S.A. over the next several months.
