Respected Members,



I am thankful for those who have sent me full or partial translation of this set of sentences. I still need it to be done by some other Sanskrits in order to know the variation. Please try to translate Part A or B if not both. If you do not want to share your translation in public, you might send it in my gmail account, that is,
[mgo...@gmail.com](). I will acknowledge you in my write up.



Thank you.



With warm regards,

Madhav
