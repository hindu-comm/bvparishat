I had mentioned about this episode and development in my earlier message.

  

There is no specific reference to the Brahmanda PuraNa and in the latter part the development of the story into fitting to the frame work of Pandala prince is given.

  

Now the remaining, thing the reference of Aryaka his identification of him with ShastR is yet to be considered , but in the same token the dhyana-shloka goes against the popular concept of Ayyappa as bachelor yet witnessed. I had been asked the same question Prabhaa-satyaka, whether they are the names of wives of Shastra. But, it seems, Prabha and Satyaka are some later coined sanskrit words, corresponding to Prabhaa(vallii) and Sattige (a top on the Prabhavali (which a round ornament around the image as can be seen in the image of Ayyappa) \[a kannada word\] in iconography. May not be found in Sanskrit lexicons, which lends support to the later invention of the fitting story. Anyhow, I have no intention to question the authority of Tantra-sara-samuccaya). There are too many tantra-s. There is Ayyanar which not at all a Satvic image like Ayyappa, And ShastR as I had mentioned, in Sanskrit literature refers to only Buddha and the ruler. Tantric concept may differ in many respect from the General Literature and is yet to be comprehensively studied with regional developments.

  

As I had mentioned, all the PuraNa-s agree till the union of Mohini and Shiva, after the distribution of Amruta and destruction of the demons. The later development is to be attested. Vikipedia also doesn't give any reference to BrayhmandapuraNa, but some book written based on the legends. (&Yet to be verified. It is noticed somebody adds anything ascribed to some literary authorities, but would never found or attested in the Vikipeadia, as it is an open book that anybody can add anything)  

  
Thanks for the information.
