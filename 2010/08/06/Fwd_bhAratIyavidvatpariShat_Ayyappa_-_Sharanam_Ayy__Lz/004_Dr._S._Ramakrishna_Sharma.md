नत्वा,  
वनशास्ता, धर्मशास्ता are the variants of Ayyappa as known to the Shabarimala  
pilgrims and their Guru-Swamis. ShAsta Sahasranamam may throw more light on other aspects.  
  
Asianet had a well researched telecast/serial on Ayyappa  
which revealed many less known episodes related to the incarnation of  
Dharma Shasta as Ayyappa in the Royal Family of Panthalam in Kerala.  
The Makaravilakku Annual Festival at Shabarimala has a colorful episode  
of the Thiruvaabharanam Box being carried in procession from the Royal Home/Palace  
to Shabari Temple. This box contains the very dress and decorative gold items given to  
the incarnate Dharma ShAsta by his father.

  
  
\>Then the name/ qualifier गोप्ता for whom in the मूलमन्त्र -  
ओम् घ्रूं नमः पराय गोप्त्रे etc. ?  

This mantra is meant for Dharma ShAsta/ Ayyappa which is used in "ShAsta Preeti" also.  
Further,  
Another Dhyanam of Dharma ShAsta in Vana-ShAsta Form  
follows:  
आरूढ प्रौढवेगं प्रविजितपवनं तुन्गतुङ्गं तुरङ्गं  
नीलं चेलं वसान: करतलविलसत् काण्डकोदण्डदण्ड : ।  
रागद्वेषादिनानाविधमृगपटली भीतिकृत्भूतभर्ता  
कुर्वन्नाखेडलीलां प्रविलसतु मन:कानने मामकीने।।  
(Attributed to Sri Sankaracharya, may be one among the Matha/Peetha Adhipatis)
