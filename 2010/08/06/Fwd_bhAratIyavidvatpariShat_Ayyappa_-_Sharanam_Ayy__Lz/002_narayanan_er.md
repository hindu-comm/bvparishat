Respected Professor Bhatt Sir,  
  
I would like to add from the Wikipeadea, the following:  
  
In the *[Brahmanda Purana](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahmanda_Purana "Brahmanda Purana")* when the wandering sage [Narada](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narada "Narada") tells Shiva about Vishnu's Mohini form that deluded the demons, Shiva dismisses him. Shiva and his wife Parvati go to Vishnu's home. Shiva asks him to take on the Mohini form again so he can see the actual transformation for himself. Vishnu smiles, again mediates on the Goddess, and in place of Vishnu stands the gorgeous Mohini. Overcome by lust, Shiva chases Mohini as Parvati hangs her head in shame and envy. Shiva grabs Mohini's hand and embraces her, but Mohini frees herself and runs further. Finally, Shiva grabs her and their "violent coupling" leads to discharge of Shiva's seed which falls "short of its goal," suggesting the act was consummated. The seed falls on the ground and the god Maha-[Shasta](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shasta_%28deity%29 "Shasta (deity)") ("The Great Chastiser") is born. Mohini disappears, while Shiva returns home with Parvati.^([\[28\]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohini#cite_note-27)[\[29\]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohini#cite_note-Vanita69-28)) Shasta is identified primarily with two regional deities: [Ayyappa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayyappan "Ayyappan") from [Kerala](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerala "Kerala") and the Tamil [Aiyanar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aiyanar "Aiyanar"). He is also identified with the classical Hindu gods [Skanda](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murugan "Murugan") and [Hanuman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanuman "Hanuman").^([\[30\]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohini#cite_note-D64-29)) In the later story of the origin of Ayyappa, Shiva impregnates Mohini, who gives birth to Ayyappa. They abandon Ayyappa in shame. The legend highlights Vishnu's protests to be Mohini again and also notes that Ayyappa is born of Vishnu's thigh as Mohini does not have a real womb.^([\[31\]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohini#cite_note-30)) Another variant says that instead of a biological origin, Ayyappa sprang from Shiva's semen, which he ejaculated upon embracing Mohini.^([\[32\]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohini#cite_note-31)) Ayyappa is referred to as *Hariharaputra*, "the son of Vishnu (Hari) and Shiva (Hara)", and grows up to be a great hero.^([\[33\]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohini#cite_note-Vanita94-32))
