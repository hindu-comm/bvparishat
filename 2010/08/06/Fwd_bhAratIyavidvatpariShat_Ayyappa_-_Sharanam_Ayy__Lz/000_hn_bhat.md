===================

Dear Sir,

  

Thanks for raising the question. I had been haunted by this for long but could not find a solution. But this is based on the belief of people in heroic worship as we see in Tulunadu many daiva-s:

  

> **Lord Ayyappa and Sabarimala**  
> There are many stories regarding the birth of Lord Ayyappa. According > to mythology Lord Ayyappa was an adopted son of King Rajasekara, a > descendent of Pandya dynasty. As the king did not have a biological > child he prayed to Lord Shiva. He was granted an orphan who was found > as a baby on the bank of River Pampa which is considered as holy as > the Ganges. The king took him to palace after a sage appeared and told > that the baby had divine powers and whose identity would be known on > his 12th birthday. While Lord Ayyappa grew in the palace, the queen > gave birth to a baby boy. The queen, instigated by a royal minister, > hatched a plan to eliminate Lord Ayyappa to prevent him from ascending > the throne. She faked illness and made Lord Ayyappa go in search of > tiger's milk assuming he would get killed. But Lord Ayyappa returned > with a tigress and tigers to the palace. At the same time, the sage > reappeared and revealed the identity of Lord Ayyappa to the king. The > king decided to build a temple in the name of Lord Ayyappa. The lord > aimed an arrow and shot it at the hills. He told the king to build the > temple where the arrow landed. King Rajasekara laid the foundation > stone for this temple and built it at Sabarimala. It is believed that > Parasurama Maharshi installed the idol of Ayyappa at Sabarimala.  
>   
> According to another story, Lord Ayyappa was known as ‘Ayyan’ and was > the army chief of the Pandalam royal family. During a war, he got > killed and his uncle built a temple in his name after realizing his > real form. After his demise, Lord Ayyappa was considered as an > incarnation of Lord Sastha and people began worshipping him.

  

The latter versions somehow got entangled with mythology of Shiva and Mohini, of whom an union was mentioned in Bhagavata, and in later Purana-s might have found place as giving birth to a child Shasta. In many web pages, I found the statement *that none of the known Purana-s lend support to this story.*

  

Parisheshyaat the last version of the stories given above highlighted seems to be somewhat reliable, if it is supported by history. In anyway, Ayyappa is related with the Pandalam family either as adopted son of Pandala king from Pandyan royal family or a chieftain in his legions. No historical evidence is put forward by anyone even in this respect, but the royal ornaments said to belong to Ayyappa in the custody of the royal treasury of Pandalam palace is still today is taken with band and procession to Ayyappa temple to adorn the image during the specific days.

  

It is to be noted a form of Shiva or so known as Shastr is worshiped in the Linga, in some places in Tulunadu and the shrine is built without roof as I have seen.

  

And, Sanskrit lexicons record Shastr as an epithet of Buddha. "Buddhah .... .... muniindra.h shriighanaH shaastaa" and shastaa samntabhadre samantabhadre naa shaasake punaranyavat" (Amara 1.1.14) and (Medini 58.63).

  

Anyhow, they mention one Shastr-kalpa according to which the methods of worship are performed.

  

Some ascribe it to Parashurama who founded the temple according to some sources.

  

More opinions/Informations (authentic sources) from learned scholars are welcome.
