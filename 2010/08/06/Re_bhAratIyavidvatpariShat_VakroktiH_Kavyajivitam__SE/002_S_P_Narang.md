Of course, vidagdha includes all the aesthetic qualities. But in local languages, it is equated with chhailaa or chailaa in Hindi where the qualities of a vagabond are found. It is found in Karpuramanjari where the sanskrit chaayaa is found as vidagdha. Its etymological meaning: burnt from inside: expresses its ingredients. Prakrit chailaa is different from Sanskrit vidagdha. Regards, spnarang
