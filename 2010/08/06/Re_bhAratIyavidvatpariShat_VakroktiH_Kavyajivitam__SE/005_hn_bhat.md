Thanks for the well founded explanation for the sentence of Kuntakacharya.

  

As it happens, while Anandavardhana well established his new school of Dhvani theory as the essence of Poetry with his philosophical exegesis, against Riti of Vamana and Dandi, with many followers attracted by the systematic presentation they could develop, Kuntaka, tried to set the path in a new perspective taking his clue from his predecessor Bhamaha, who had long ago hinted the possibility of the expansion of the concept of Alankara itself:   
  
"सैषा सर्वत्र वक्रोक्तिरनयार्थो विभाव्यते।  
यत्नो ऽस्यां कविना कार्यः को ऽलंकारो ऽनया विना॥"  

  

And his work is the outcome of his thinking in line with Bhamaha, but unfortunately in spite of his सहृदय aesthetic approach, it could not attract any followers and ended up with himself and moved behind the scene of literary criticism at all. The reason seems to be obvious as he tried to reconcile different theories of Meaning into Poetic Language(in support of and against Dhvani theory)to take it beyond the constraints of the prevalent theories in the name of Vakrokti, the vyapara of Kavi. This the staunch followers of Dhvani, didn't tolerate and put him aside even giving him a try. Even the follower of Alankara school Ruyyaka, favored (if properly taken) Mahimabhatta's Kavyanumiti, and not Vakrokti of Kuntaka as himself found influenced by the Dhvani school.

  

This the short background of the statement of Kuntaka, when he says,

  

"...तयोः पुनरलंकृतिः।

वक्रोक्तिरेव (या) वैदग्ध्यभङ्गीभणितिरुच्यते॥"

  

which is clearly a retaking of Bhamaha-s statement in its wider perspective Kavi-vyapara. (or kavi-vibhavana) poetical imagination. More comments in this respect are solicited.

  

Thanks for all who contributed to this discussion in their own way. Originally, a beginner had asked for an explanation of this he found somewhere while reading.
