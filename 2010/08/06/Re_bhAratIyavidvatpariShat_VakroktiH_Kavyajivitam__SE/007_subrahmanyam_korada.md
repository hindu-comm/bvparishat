namo vidvadbhyah



I (rather many) have have the problem - some people (non-sanskritists) have difficulty in

reading the Devanagari fluently . Scolars prefer the script .



1\. Jaimini etc is quoted simply to show that the meaning that is there in Veda, which is Yougika

should not be applied in Alankarasastra , but the RUdhi is to be taken .



2\. I never said , rather anybody can say that 'digdha' becomes 'vidagdha' , both are separate words . I just explained the meaning of the former because it is not in currency.



'LIlAkalAsu digdhAtmA vidagdha iti kItritah ' - is right .



3\. I did not say 'purodasa need not etc.' . In fact, i did not discuss the meaning or anythingelse much but just gave the context to show that the analysis involving the term 'vidagdha' .



If any scholar wants we can discuss the Mahavakyartha .
