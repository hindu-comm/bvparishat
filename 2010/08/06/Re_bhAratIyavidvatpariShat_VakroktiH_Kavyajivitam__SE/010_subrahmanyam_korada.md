once it was typed but had gone due to Machine problem .



It is better to get by heart **'Namalinganusasanam ' ( Amarakosa**) . I learnt it at the age of five or so . Note the following --



**pustakasthA ca yA vidyA parahaste ca yaddhanam I**

**kAryakAle samAyAte na sA vidyA na taddhanam** II  


Irrespective of age one can learn a **Kosa - ajarAmaravatprAjnah vidyAmartham ca sAdhayet, kosavAnAcAryah .  
**Without prejudice to any person or subject , presently the learning and retention are at the stage of **'ApaksIyate' . MedhAsakti (dhIrdhAranAvatI medhA - Amarakosa**) is not being put to use.

Once upon a time the **Whiteman** used to call the Indian scholars as ' **walking libraries** ' .



**Amarakosa** gives both - **Lingas and ParyAyas** .



2\. Learn **Panini's Linganusasanam . 'GhanajabantAh'** - this **sutra** tells you that the words ending in the listed **Pratyayas** will be in **Pumlinga** .



3\. Read a lot of **Literature** , different **Sastras**, **Darsanas** etc. Hardwork is the secret .



4\. If at an young age one may consume - **SarasvatIlehyam and SarasvatItailam** to enhance memorypower . **Ghrtena vardhate buddhih.**
