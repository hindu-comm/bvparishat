Sir, Namaste!

I want to know if any short-cut method is there to find outwhether a Sanskrit noun is in masculine gender or common gender so that it will be easy to use the \`bahuvachana' correctly. For example, we say in Telugu \`vedam' whereas it is 'veda' singlular and \`vedaH' in bahuvachanam. How to know whether to say vedaH or vedani; graamaaH or graamani; vrikshaaH or vrikshani; grihaaH or grihaani; mithraaH or mitrani.

It may be a silly doubt to put before the scholars who are writing in these columns. Still I would like to know any method is there. Because in Sabdamanjari the examples given may not be for all the nouns. Which noun becomes napunsaka lingam or pumlingam is my doubt please.

Thanks and regards to the Scholars,
