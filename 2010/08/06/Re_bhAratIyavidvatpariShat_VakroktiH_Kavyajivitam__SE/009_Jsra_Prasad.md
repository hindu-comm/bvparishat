Dear Sir,  
PraNaam. The dual and plural forms of words just convey the multiplicity word referent while the meaning is constant.  
As a Sanskrit student, I try to analyse the gender suffix involved in the declension form of a valid word. Say, for instance, 'घञ्' is the suffix involved in treating the word 'veda' for masculine gender. As a thumb rule, all such words are in masculine gender, wherever you find the above suffix. Similar function is with respective suffixes in feminine and neuter gender words. Alternatively, you may refer to the 'लिङ्गानुशासनम्*'* in which you can find the word classifications of all three genders.  
File is attached. Thanks to the courtesy of Rashtriya Sanskrit Samsthan, Delhi.  
Scholars are *pramaNa* for elaborations.  
Regards,  
Prasad
