My dear Narang ji,

 I have already apologised.It was the Report of the sanskrit Commission that was translated into Sanskrit by MM parameshvarananda Shastri in Sixties of the last century.But i understand the Indian Constitution too was translated into Sanskrit.But I am not aware of the details .

 All the best for all of us on the SaMskRtadivasa eve,

 Ram Karan Sharma
