### Dear All,

The following is taken from a website [healing.about.com](http://healing.about.com/od/ascmaster_channeling/a/violet-flame-of-transmutation.htm?nl=1) just to point out how much deeper  
we have in our tradition of Sandhya Vandanam a meditation more systematic and instantly rewarding.  
Recent posts on Ayurvedic Concepts of Agni become more evident in the experiential performance  
of the Sandhya Meditations.  
  

### Yes, it takes performance and not mere discussion;all the better, 

### if it can lead to better performance. 

### Violet Flame Incantation

*\~I invoke the violet flame be set ablaze within my core being.  
\~All my imperfections are burnt away, All my fears are put to rest.  
\~Old karmic ties and negative thoughts fall away, Replaced with opportunity and positive thinking.  
\~Keep the embers burning **inside my belly,** As a reminder not to hold on to useless ideas.  
\~Free me of needless burdens, clearing the pathway to my complete enlightenment.*
