Simply because the first sentence wrong :)

  

"****रामेण वनं गच्छन् तृणं स्पृश्यते****

  

wrong in syntax. How can you relate the adjective****गच्छन् with any word in the sentence?****

  

In the second, it is the adjective and it is logically related with Rama and takes the same case-ending as in the Active voice, in the passive alsoand hence it is right. In Active voice, it is related in active voice also as adjective with Rama, the subject of both the verbs and hence it is related with his action********तृणं and becomes karma, by the rule " तथायुक्तं चानीप्सितम्"।****
