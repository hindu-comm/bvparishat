Thanks Bhattacharya for clarifying the point.

  

In my message also I tried to explain the same, but avoiding as far as possible technical terms in view of the question raised basically on the choice between the correctness of one correct and another incorrect sentence (may be due basic knowledge of grammar).

  

Hope this would be grasped in their right technical aspects. 

  

We may expect our learned friend Korada Subrahmanyam also at any time on the scene for further analysis of the point.

  

She had raised a new question why there is सामानाधिकरण्य between two words that carry the same Vibhakti. Hope this will expalain the term in general:

  

> [सामानाधिकरण्य](http://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=%E0%A4%B8%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%A8%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%A7%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%A3%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%AF&action=edit&redlink=1 "सामानाधिकरण्य (page does not exist)")(sāmānādhikaraṇya) >
> n\. (fr.%{samAnA7dhikaraNa}) common office or function Hit. >
> the condition of relating to the same object or residing in the same > subject Sarvad. >
> grammatical agreement, identity of case. relation, correlation (opp. > to%{vaiyAdh-}) Pa1n2. Sch.

As per the western concept, the term is equal to agreement of co-related objects denoted by two words. Somewhere I saw it as abheda also between the पदार्थ-s of the two words which makes the agreement between the adjective and the qualified word by it possible. in Sanskrit term विशेषण-विशेष्यभाव and this is logically exists between the two objects denoted by the words and expressed by the terms using the agreement of case, gender and number between them in Sanskrit Sentence (where they are obligatorily followed) for syntactical purpose. I hope there is no specific Sutra or rule in Paninian Ashtadhyayi except the norm I cited in my earlier message.

  

With regards
