Dear friends,

  

I also didn't mean to show the usages of Namul in Sanskrit Language, but only wanted to show that the idiomatic usage of the suffix does not or may not permit any similarity of meaning closer to that of the Hindi expression जाते हुए। I And no Sanskrit scholar would propose that the शत्रन्त and णमुलन्त are used in the same sense. I only proposed that the usage of Namul may not be able to convey the same expression of the Hindi expression in question. The reason is evident, this needs the order of priority पूर्वकाल and आभीक्ष्ण्य as the sanskrit usages quoted convey. This is totally absent in the Hindi expression, which conveys only समानकर्तृकत्व, but simultaneous action समकालिकक्रिया in the present tense. In such cases, under the Sutra itself, the usage will be वदति पचति च > the same thing expressed with Shatr for the preceding verb would be वदन् पचति which is a proper Sanskrit sentence. Just like वदन् ओदनं पचति। with only the difference that the Agent is not expressed in the sentence except implied by the inflexion. It is the same expression with ग्रामं गच्छन् तृणं स्पृशति only with the difference that here one of the two objects कर्म-s तृण takes the accusative case is prescribed by the rule ‘तथा युक्तं चानीप्सितम्’. Now without the specific mention of Rama, how would you translate the expression into Hindi? Would it be जाता हुआ तृण के स्पर्श कर्ता है or जाते हुए तृण के स्पर्श कर्ता है? In Sanskrit the sentence and expression is correct and it is the example cited for the Sutra quoted. It is obvious that the mention of the name of Rama is not obligatory. It makes difference only in Hindi, with the presence of Rama and its position in Hindi usage, as our member Sheetal had raised the question from the point of Hindi language tried to explain differently. In Sanskrit, as I had earlier suggested, रामो गच्छन् ... 0r गच्छन् रामः .. तृणं स्पृशति would make slight change of meaning. In Hindi, it is expressed with two different modes of verbs as adjective and adverbial form of the verb. This is my impression on the question.

  

If I am wrong, please correct me as I am not conversant with the grammatical conventions of Hindi Language which is still developing.

  

Pardon me for the length of the post as I also wanted to know the precise difference between the two Hindi expressions.

  

With regards
