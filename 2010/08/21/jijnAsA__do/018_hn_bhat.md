Dear friend,

  

This has been repeated many times in previous message and here again she has raised the same question with reference to her Hindi sentences where she has taken in the first post in this message:

  

  

> हिन्दी में मेरे पास दो वाक्य हैं -

> १. जाता हुआ राम तृण को स्पर्श करता है \|

>  जिसका कर्तरि-प्रयोग में संस्कृत-अनुवाद है - गच्छन् रामः तृणं > स्पृशति \|

>                कर्मणि- प्रयोग में - गच्छता रामेण तृणं > स्पृश्यते \|

>   

> २. राम जाते हुए तृण को स्पर्श करता है \|

>  जिसका कर्तरि-प्रयोग में संस्कृत-अनुवाद है - रामः गच्छन् तृणं > स्पृशति \|

  

  

Here question is here:

  

> अब मेरा प्रश्न यह है कि "गच्छन्" जो हिन्दी के क्रिया-विशेषण का संस्कतृ > में अनुवाद है , उसका कर्मणि-प्रयोग में रूप क्या होना चाहिये > "रामेण**गच्छन्**तृणं स्पृश्यते" उत "रामेण**गच्छता**तृणं स्पृश्यते" > ?

  

The above question answered by Deepak Bhattacharya also. The above is her first question she has mentioned it isहिन्दी के क्रिया-विशेषण and knows it is notक्रिया-विशेषणin Sanskrit.

  

Now it is my question is whether her assertion in the two Hindi sentences, are both the sentences have the same meaning or different meaning? If different, is it possible or necessary to translate them into Sanskrit differentlyand how to translate if possible?

  

She has changed the voice of the same sentence in Sanskrit for the purpose and change of voice doesn't mean change in meaning or syntactical status of the words of the sentence technically according to Sanskrit Grammar. I hope there is also the possibility of change of voice in Hindi also, which doesn't change the shade of meaning of the sentence.
