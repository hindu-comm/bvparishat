Dear Bhattacharya,

  
*‘क्रियाविशेषणानां*कर्मत्व क्लीवत्व च'इति कात्यायनवचनम्,

‘सामान्ये नपुंसकम्।’  
इति क्रियाविशेषणानां प्रायेण नियमः। मृदु पचति, मधुरं गायति इत्यादयः प्रयोगाः। विशेषणवाचकपदानामेव सुष्ठु गायति क्षिप्रं धावति इत्यादीनां स्वाभाव्येन संस्कृते प्रयोगो रूढः।

  

क्रियाविशेषणानां क्लीबत्वं कर्मत्वं चेत्यथविमर्श:/is a topic of a book अक्षरपुरुष byप्रो.रामकिशोरशुक्ल:  

  

Whereas णमुल् is concerned,

  

"३. ४. २१ समानकर्तृकयोः पूर्वकाले ।  
३. ४. २२ आभीक्ष्ण्ये णमुल् च ।" इति आभीक्ष्ण्ये पूर्वकाले णमुल् क्त्वस्थाने विधीयते। गत्वा गत्वा इत्यर्थः। उभयोः पर्यायेण प्रयोगः।

  

गामं गाममपश्यद् = गत्वा गत्वा अपश्यत्

  

Hence I am afraid it may not convey the same meaning as in Hindi usage as this is simultaneous actions by the same person.

  

In English, it is Adverbial clause or adverbial phrase and not an adverb proper. It would be only functioning as an adverb in that much that it is denotes simultaneous action of the two verbs. As in

  

ग्रामं गच्छन् = यदा ग्रामं गच्छति, तृणं स्पृशति = (तदा) स्पृशति।

  

The rule तथायुक्तं चानीप्सितम् co-relates both the verbs with the object.

  

रामो गच्छन् or गच्छन् रामः would convey the difference in meaning due to the change of उद्देश्य-विधेय-भाव the remaining part kept in tact. I think this would convey the difference between the two Hindi usages (where also the order is changed in the same way, but with little inflections due to this change). It need not be an adverb proper which is in English also is derived from adjectives like proper - properly etc. In Sanskrit, also they are formed in the same way from the adjectives following above quoted norm for adverbs. मृदुः पाकः - adjective usage, मृदु पचति - adverb derived from the same word.

  

This is what I guessed from the observation of the two sentences, they would some how conveyed by the change of उद्देश्य-विधेय-भाव as explained already by Prof. Veeranarayana Pandurangi in another topic dealing with the relation between of विशेषण-विशेष्य-भाव and उद्देश्य-विधेय-भाव.

  

I was expecting some suitable solution from the Hindi Speakers on this point.
