यथा लिखितं तत्र न को ऽप्यर्थः स्फुरति, गम धातोर्द्विकर्मकत्वाभावात्।

  

If this is taken from some source, please specify the source. Otherwise, you may please express your intention in forming such a sentence. Without the context it is difficult to even suggest correction to the sentence.

  

As it happens, the verb go cannot take two objects. It should take only one one object. Obviously there is no relation between the words in the sentence.
