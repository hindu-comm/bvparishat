There you are wrong Sriram. Transfomation into passive

voice doesn't change कर्तृ कारक into करणकारक।

  

Here is also it is Rama the subject or कर्ता and the object of the verb is the same तृण as in the active voice. In the active voice, Rama takes प्रथमा as he is related with the verb गच्छति and hence the object तृण takes द्वितीयाविभक्ति। In the passive voice, the verb is related with तृण and takes प्रथमा विभक्ति and hence राम takes only तृतीया as the agentकर्तृof the verb by the same rule "कर्तृकरणयोस्तृतीया।" (which prescribes तृतीया for both कर्तृ and करण व् when they are not related to by the predication. In active voice, the subject is related with predication and in the passive voice it is the object that is related to by the verb.

  

For the fresh question, there is not any specific Sutra in so far as I know, but it is commonly accepted:

  

*यल्लिङ्गं*यद्वचनं*या*च विभक्तिर्विशेषस्य. तल्लिङ्गं तद्वचनं सा च विभक्तिर्विशेषणस्यापि. १.

It takes only तृतीया विभक्ति as the verb in the passive voice and doesn't change the status of karaka.
