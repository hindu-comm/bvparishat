I don't know enough grammar of Hindi to assess the correctness of the Hindi sentences quoted for which Sanskrit Translation is intended. But in the two Hindi sentences, there is no change of voice at any rate. I can't say whether there is use of adverb. Both can be translated only in Active voice as in Hindi irrespective of the shade of meaning by the use of the same participle being the taken care of by the Sutra-s you have quoted. The same expression is expressed in two ways in Hindi also according to its usage. In one Sutra the participle शतृ is prescribed and in the other its meaning is prescribed for its usage. This doesn't change the voice as suggested by you.

  

The two Sutra-s have different implications technically. In the first, there is no सामानाधिकरण्य needed for the function of the Sutra, as it is avoided अप्रथमासमानाधिकरणे in प्रथमाविभक्ति। But it is also used in
प्रथमा also and doesn't need change of voice. The proper example is पचन्तं पश्य and पचन् चैत्रः may be wrong in view of the Sutra. But its use is sanctioned on the ground of usage by the implication of repeating लटः while वर्तमाने लट् is still in force up to the Sutra. This justifies its usage in the प्रथमासामानाधिकरण्य also. Now coming to the second Sutra लक्षणहेत्वोः is meant for specific purposes served by the participle. शयानाः भुञ्जते यवनाः is used to specify the character लक्षण of the Yavana-s. हेतुः means फल and करण. अर्जयन् वसति = अर्जनं वासस्य फलम्। हरिं पश्यन् मुच्यते = हरेः दर्शनं मोक्षे करणम्। उभयथापि हेतुत्वं शत्रन्तवाच्यायाः क्रियायाः। This is the basic difference between the applications of the two Sutra-s.

  

I leave the translation from the Hindi sentences to the Hindi speaker Sanskrit Scholars like Bhattacharya to suggest any other equivalent expressions in Sanskrit for the two than the above. But change of voice doesn't serve the purpose.
