Thanks Dr. Murthy for providing different examples of usage of "ca" potentially different in their function.

  

I also was about to suggest the same, before drawing any conclusion on this point, we will have to process and verify many more samples from the stock of Sanskrit Literature, preferably from prose passages and note the difference in the use of both. For in metrical structure, may require "ca" many times simply for filling in the metrical completion of syllables, which may not serve our purpose. This is in terms of linguists in the field survey of living languages, which may not be applied to Sanskrit, which we usetodayas we use English in day to day use. Hence spoken form could be surmised somehow from the samples from prose works either Shastra-works like Mahabhashya, Sarvadarshana-sangraha etc. and poetical and general works like Kadambari, Dasakumaracarita, which use idiomatic expressions and would not fail to make use of the idiomatic usage of this conjunct with precision of meaning. It may be a time consuming work, but may be productive in justifying the use of double coordinator "ca" than setting aside it as useless. Madhavji is the person in the field and he may be interested in this work.
