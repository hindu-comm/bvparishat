Thanks for the discussion actively taken care of by Prof. Ashok Aklujkar and Dr. Sadashivamvurthy.

In fact, as suggested by Dr.Ashok Aklujkar and Mr.Murthy there are four meanings for च : चत्वरः खलु चार्थाः।. I do not know the equivalent terms in linguistic terminology, but the examples using "ca" alternatively can be seen in the examples provided by grammarians:

  

समुच्चयः, अन्वाचयः, इतरेतरयोग and समाहारः\| and these are differently explained:

  

परस्परनिरपेक्षस्यानेकस्य एकस्मिन्नन्वयः समुच्चयः ,

अन्यतरस्यानुषङ्गिकत्वे अन्वाचयः, मिलितानामन्वयः इततेतरयोगः, समूहः समाहारः।

  

ईश्वरं गुरुं च भजस्व इति समुच्चये, भिक्षामट गां चानय इत्यन्वाचय:।

अत्र न समासो ऽसामर्थ्यात्।

  

The above example is for the co-ordination of two substances (Dravya) into one action.The other examples ofसमुच्चयः are as follows:

  

राज्ञो गावो ऽ‍श्वाश्च - द्रव्ये द्रव्ययोः समुच्चयः,

पटः शुक्लो रक्तश्च - द्रव्ये गुणयोः समुच्चयः,

रक्तः पटः कुण्डलं च - इति गुणे द्रव्ययोः समुच्चयः,

  

In all the above, there is not a single use of double च। But the use of the members of द्वन्द्व Compound in the case of समाहार and इतरेतरयोग in sentences, to show display independently, we generally use two च-s.

  

धवश्च खदिरश्च - धवखदिरौ,

भेरी च मृदङं च - भेरीमृदङ्गम्।

  

To quote the use of multiple ca the example give given from Bhartrhari is quite enough. From the epic literature also I can quote an enumeration, where ca occurs twice in the verse:

  

मत्स्यः कूर्मो वराहश्च नरसिंहो ऽथ वामनः।

रामो रामश्च रामश्च बुद्धः कल्कीति ते दश।

  

That is the normal use of ca I observed in grammar texts. Further, in South Indian languages the use of coordinators with each words is obligatorily observed. I don't remember otherwise. The use of double coordinators may due to the influence of other languages.

  

Hope I have given some more examples for the use of "ca" if it may be of any help to the discussion. This includes one one more example you had asked for the coordination of multiple action by the same agent: anvaacaya.

  

Thanks once again to Prof.Aklujkar for his concluding remarks. 

When the multiple and single use of this coordinator is attested in the written language and also in spoken languages, why should we restrict the freedom of its use in the implementation of Sanskrit Language into day to day use.

  

I am not conversant with the conventions and norms of Linguistics. If anything is irrelevant to the discussion in my post, please ignore that part or suggest correction.

  

With regards
