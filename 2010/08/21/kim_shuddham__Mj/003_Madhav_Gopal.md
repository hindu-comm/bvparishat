Shri Aklujkar Sir,



"It seems that originally the 'X ca Y ca' type construction was used when the items were perceived as belonging to distinct categories (whether they actually belonged to distinct ontological categories could have been debatable. That the speaker/author perceived them as belonging to different categories was sufficient)."



It is very difficult for me to agree with this view. I don't think there isany evidence in the literature that supports this view, if it exists, please discuss it. In Sanskrit च is a copula and itlinks twoor morelinguistic items in a sentence, whether those items are ontologically similar or not. We can see these examples:



A. 1. रामः च समुद्रः च पृथक् पदार्थौ।

 2. रामः समुद्रः च पृथक् पदार्थौ।  

B. 1. रामः च लक्ष्मणः च चलचित्रम् पश्यतः।

 2. रामः लक्ष्मणः च चलचित्रम् पश्यतः।



In A there are two ontologically different itemslinked and in B the similar ones. In both cases there is no syntactic anomaly.You yourself are saying that the distinct ontological categories could have been debatable. If they are questionable, then on this basis we can't conclude anything. Also,we can't decide how the speakers or authors are perceiving things, if there is not any uniformness in usage. If that (yours) is the case, there must be solid evidence. Please elaborate your view.



Thank you.



Shri Dr. Murty Sir,



Yes, that could be. Please add an example to show "s*imultaneity of two actions by the same agent"* using च at least two times. Let us see what our wise scholars say about this matter.



Thank you.



With regards,

Madhav
