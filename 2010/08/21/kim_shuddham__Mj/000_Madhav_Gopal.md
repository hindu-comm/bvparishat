PraNaamFriends,



Iwas inquisitive about these constructions in Sanskrit:



1. रामः हमीदा च उद्यानं गच्छतः।

2\. रामः च हमीदा च उद्यानं गच्छतः।



Here, I think, both sentences are grammatically correct. If one च is sufficient for coordination, then why the language experts repeat this च unnecessarily? Please share your opinoin with us on this issue.



Warm regards,

Madhav
