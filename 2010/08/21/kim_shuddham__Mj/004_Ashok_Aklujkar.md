In Sanskrit च is a copula and it links two or more linguistic items in a sentence, whether those items are ontologically similar or not. We can see these examples:

\> In A there are two ontologically different items linked and in B the similar ones. In both cases there is no syntactic anomaly. You yourself are saying that the distinct ontological categories could have been debatable. If they are questionable, then on this basis we can't conclude anything. Also, we can't decide how the speakers or authors are perceiving things, if there is not any uniformness in usage. If that (yours) is the case, there must be solid evidence. Please elaborate your view.

Please note "originally" in my statement. It should suggest that I am talking about early/older usage. Citing self-made modern examples misses the point.

The issue is of meaning difference (this meaning may be thought of as dyotya 'co-signified' or as connotation of the sentence as a whole), not of syntax.

When you wrote, "I don't think there is any evidence in the literature that supports this view, if it exists, please discuss it," had you read the literature I referred to?

I am open to correction as the use of "seems" in my quoted remark should indicate. However, that correction should be based on an accurate understanding of what I wrote and a body of evidence coming from the same period that serves to offer a more straightforward / plausible / economic explanation than the one I gave.
