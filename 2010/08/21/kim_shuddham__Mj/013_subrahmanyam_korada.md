yes , **ca** sometimes does not have any meaning . In fact, I did not give the complete picture and it may take a book to explain .



**rAmah krsnasca Agacchati / Agacchatah** - both are correct .



It is clear in **Mahabhasyam** under **'cArthe dvandvah'** (Panini 2-2-29) that there cannot be **SamAsa** in the sense of **Samuccaya and AnvAcaya** . Why ? because there is no **SAmarthyam** , ' **samarthah padavidhih'(2-1-1) .**



In **vAkyAlamkAra** also **ca** is just **ornamental** -



**NipAta in VyAkaranam - ' uccAranam'** ( of a readymade word ) - **srotriyamchando'dhIte**

(Pan 5-2-84) .



**Niruktam - uccAvacesvarthesu nipatantIti nipAtAh**



**PrAtisAkhyA - ' nipAtah pAdapUranah'** .



**VAkyAlamkAra** is not confined to ' **ca** ' - **khlUktvA khalu bhAsitam - SisupAlavadha** (2) .

Here either **'khalu'** is in **VAkyAlamkAra** .



In **Telugu** there is a saying - Rama followed his father's words **without missing 'tu' and**

'**ca'** . That means taking the meaning of **even tu and ca** , which , in fact , **have no meaning** **at all** .

  
The other point -**'ca'** is commented as ' **uktasamuccAyaka'** and ' **anuktasamuccAyaka** '

especially in **Vyakaranam and Kosa** . The latter is used to include certain other examples

and this is under - **vyAkhyAnato visesapratipattih** and ' **sUtresveva hi tatsarvam yadvrttau** **yacca vArtike '.  
**

**AdhiparI anarthakau** (Pan 1-4-92 ) - is **PramAnam .** This aspect is beautifully explained

by **Hari** (VP **2-190)** --



**aprayoge'dhiparyosca** yAvaddrstam kriyAntaram I

tasyAbhidhayako dhAtuh saha **tAbhyAmanarthakah** II



Regarding the use of the word ' **samuccaya**' instead of '**samuccita'** there will be problem

- **cAdayo'sattve** (Pan 1-4-57 is not followed and as a result we cannot get **AvyayasamjnA**

by '**svarAdinipAtamavyayam**' (Pan1-1-37 ) -- explains **Hari** (VP2-195) -



**samuccitAbhidhAne'pi vyatireko na vidyate I**

**asattvabhUto bhAvasca kriyAnyenAbhidhIyate** II



In **Vrttisamuddesa of Padakanda**(Vakyapad.) Hari takes up the SUtra, **cArthe dvandvah**

and explains in 20 verses If read with commentary one would get the **'tattvam'** of **'ca'** --



**cArthah sabde kvacidbhedAt kathamcit samavassthitah I**

**dyotakAscAdayastasya vaktA dvandvastu tadvatAm** II etc.
