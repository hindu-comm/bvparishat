First, utility alone cannot be and should not be a decisive consideration in all life situations. If Skt did not have the freedom to employ more than one ca, how would we get the beauty of lines like dhik taa.m ca ta.m ca madana.m ca imaa.m ca maa.m ca (Bhart.r-hari, ;Sataka-traya).

Secondly, it is not a universal truth that languages have no unnecessary elements. Constructions like "He ain't no fool" meaning "He is not a fool' are quite common in certain varieties of American English.

Thirdly, any language in use has a dynamic of the past and present, of the prescriptive and non-prescriptive and of the conventional and creative. There would be nothing unusual or damaging if some Sanskrit writers/speakers continued to use one ca and some continued to squander ca-s or if one and the same writer/speaker oscillated between one-ca-use and more-than-one-ca use. The world already has enough problems coming from persons who think that what is good in their view must be followed by all. I do not wish to add to the problems by suggesting that Sanskrit writers/speakers should follow only one path. Maybe that is the message of the Yajurveda in having a camaka section as well as a namaka section! prak.rty-anuruupa.m parivartanam anubhavantii pravahataat sa.msk.rta-mandaakinii.
