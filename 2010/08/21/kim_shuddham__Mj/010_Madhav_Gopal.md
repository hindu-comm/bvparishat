I am very thankful to the scholars namely Prof. Ashok Aklujkar, Prof. H.N, Bhat and Dr. Rani Sadashiv Murty forenlightening me on this complicated issue. Their views are really very valuable and up to the point. As Prof. Bhat suggests, a study could be carried out on this aspect of Sanskrit language perusing specially the prose worksthat he has quoted. I hope some of us will definitely take up this issue to find the exact glory of the different usages ofच.



Thank you all.



With warm regards,

Madhav
