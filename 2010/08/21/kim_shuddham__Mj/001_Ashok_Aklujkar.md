It seems that originally the 'X ca Y ca' type construction was used when the items were perceived as belonging to distinct categories (whether they actually belonged to distinct ontological categories could have been debatable. That the speaker/author perceived them as belonging to different categories was sufficient).

  

See Aklujkar, Ashok.1991. "Syntactic Gleanings from Bhart®-hari's Trikå∫∂^ \[= Våkyapad^ya\]."*Studies in Sanskrit Syntax,*pp. 1-11. (ed) Hock, Hans Henrich. Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass.  

  

In older literature, using only two ca-s to join three items, that is, to employ an 'X, Y ca Z ca' construction is also found; e.g. Nirukta ima.m grantha.m \[= nigha.n.tum\] samaamnaasi.sur, veda.m ca vedaa:ngaani ca.'

  

See Aklujkar, Ashok.1999.*The Theory of Nipåtas (Particles) in Yåska's Nirukta.*Pune: Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute. Post-graduate and Research Department Series No. 42. Pandit Shripad Shastri Deodhar Memorial Lectures, sixth series.
