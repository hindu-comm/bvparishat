Three or four types of Meaning has been there ever since the Language is used as a tool

in the transformation of ideas.



In Vyakaranam it is **MukhyArtha** and **GaunArtha** for **VAcyArtha** and **LaksyArtha** .

**'AbhidhIyate**' is used by **Patanjal**i if not **AbhidhA** .



jahatsvArthAyAm ca na dosah , **samudAyArtho'bhidhIyate** (IdUtau ca , 1-1-19).



Under 'PumyogAdAkhyAyAm"(Pani 4-1-49) **Patanjali**illustrates **LaksanA** (see also **Nyayasutram**) .



The usage of the word '**jnApaka** ' in **Mahabhasya** denotes the so called '**VyanjanA**' --



kenedAnIm samkhyApradesesu samkhyAsampratyayo bhavisyati? **'jnApakAt siddham'**

(bahugana 1-1-23).

atra **AcAryaprvrttih jnApayati** - tadvisesebhyo na bhavatIti yadayam vipAtsabdam saratprabhrtisu pathati .



The **ParibhAsA - jnApakasiddham na sarvatra** - also refers to **VyangyArtha** .



In **Uddyota Nagesa** remarks - tadetat dhvanayannaha on ' arthavadgrahane ityasya svam rUpam ityanena jnApitatvAt (Mahabhasyam , dAdAghvadap 1-1-20) .



Even **Kaiyata** states - **bhAsyAbdhih kvAtigambhIrah** ? the 'atigambhIratvam' is nothing but

having more meaning than that is seen apparently .



Any scholar who goes thru one or two **Ahnikas** of **Mahabhasy**a would certainly come across a number of discussions involving the hidden meaning of **Paninisutras** .



**AnekamanyapadArthe** (2-2-24) , according to Hari , is a Sutra that suggests that there is **jahatsvArthavikalpa** --



jahatsvArthavikalpe ca **sarvArthatyAgamicchatA** I

bahuvrIhipadArthasya **tyAgah sarvasya darsitah** II (Vakyapadi 2-228)



It should be noted that **Panini** ( nor can anybodyelse) does not say everything with

**vAcyamaryAdA**, nor is it possible . '**SAravat**' means ' having a lot of meaning' .



**VyAkhyAnato visesapratipattih** - means the suggested also .



As far as the words **Vyangya, Vynanjaka and VyanjanA**are concerned
they are used by **Hari** (in 1at and 2nd Adhyayas)--



**vyanjakA bhinnA varnavAkyapadesu** ye (1-88)

**anekavyaktyabhivyangyA** jAtih (1-93)

**tulyopavyanjanA** srutih (2-21)

**vyangyavyanjakabhAvena** tathaiva **sphotanAdayoh** (1-97) etc.



**DhAtUnAm anekArthatvam** is suggested by **Panini** - mrsastitiksAyAm (1-2-20) parau bhuvo'vajnAne (3-3-55) .

Across 1st and 2nd chapters Hari discusses the **VAcyArtha , GaunArtha VyangyArtha** and **TAtparyArtha** (kAkebhyo raksyatA sarpih - **upalaksanam** etc.) . This is what , probably,

led **Mammatacarya** to remark - **tAtparyArtho'pi kesucit** .



**Anandavardhanacarya** clearly states that '**Dhvani**' is taken from **Vyakaranam** - budhaih vaiyAkaranaihsphotarUpavyangyavyanjakasya dhvaniriti vyavahArah kdetah .



One should have the knowledge of all the four Sastras to teach Alamkarasastra .
