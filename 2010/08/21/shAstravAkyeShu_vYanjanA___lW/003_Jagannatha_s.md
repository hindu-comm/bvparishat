Respected scholars,



The question of mine is not related toacceptance of vyanjana in that shastra or this shastra. Neither it is related tohaving Dhvani meaning from any literary piece.The question is of extractingVyanjanaa
meaning through Shastravakyas.Pandit Raamaajnaa Pandeya opines thatit is possible to extract Vyanjanaa meaning from the sentences of Mahaabhaashya. I am not making query here about Patanjali's acceptance or non-acceptance of Vyanjanaa. Obviously, no sentence of Bhattikaavya is being questioned. Whether it is possible to extract vyanjanaa meanings from Patanjali's OWN sentence patterns- that is the theme of my post.

S.Jagannatha.
