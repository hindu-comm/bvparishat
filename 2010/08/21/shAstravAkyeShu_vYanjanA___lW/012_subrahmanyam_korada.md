yes , there is or has ben problem with understanding -  
  
**'sarvatraiva hi vAkyArthah laksya eveti nah sthitih' - TantravArtiksm** , Some **MImAmsakas** accept **LaksanA** only .  
  
This was refuted by **Hari (VAkyakAnda -VAkyapadIyam**) - **asAbdo yadi vAkyArthah padArtho'pi tathA bhavet** .  
  
**PrAbhAkaras** - by **AbhidhA** only -- **isoriva dIrghadIrghataro vyApArah .  
**  
**NaiyAyikas - AbhidhA** and **LaksanA** only . **VyangyArtha** is understood thru either and / or **Manas** . **Vyaktiviveka** was  
meant to exhibit inclusion of **Dhvani** ( of **Anandavardhana**) in **AnumAna** .  
  
**Gamakatvam** - would offer a detailed picture of **VyanjanA** in **Vyakarana** .
