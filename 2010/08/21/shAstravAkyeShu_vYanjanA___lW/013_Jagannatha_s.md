Thank you sir for quoting the interesting sentence

सर्वत्रैव हि वाक्यार्थो लक्ष्य एवेति नः स्थितिः and continuing discussion with further useful information.

Now please enlighten me on the following point.

The statement of BhAshya‘astir bhavantI para.h avidyamAno'pyasti. Devadatta ityukte astIti gamyate.’ is well known. Now my question:

Does theverb ‘gamyate’ mean ‘vyajyate’ or ‘lakshyate’?

If ‘lakshyate’ is the meaning, can we take this as an example for UpAdAnalakshaNA ?

(The verypronunciation of the word ‘Devadatta’ includes the meaning ‘Asti’.)

The reason for my query is the concept ‘gatyarthaanaam dhaatuunam jnaanaarthakatvam’.

Does ‘gamyamaana Artha’ mean ‘vyajyamaana artha?’
