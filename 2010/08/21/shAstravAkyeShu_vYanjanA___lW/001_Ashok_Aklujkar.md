An excellent question. However, the assumption that there is a fundamental difference between ;saastra sentences and saahitya or kaavya sentences as far as modes (v.rttis) of conveying are concerned is questionable. One should separate the processes or phenomena that take place in conveying from how one thoerizes about those processes or phenomena. The latter depends on what a theoretician prefers in certain other related areas (e.g., if one holds that with every change of meaning a word becomes a different entiry -- artha-bhedac.chabda-bheda.h no matter how small the difference is, then there would be no laak.sa.nika or vya;njaka ;sabdas. If, on the other hand, one holds that the word remains the same or that certain small differences of meaning (e.g., ga:ngaa standing for ga:ngaa-pravaaha) are to be viewed as insufficient justification for postulating a different word, one remains free to admit (a)laak.sa.nika or (b)laak.sa.nikaandvya;njaka ;sabdas in one's theory.

  

It would be quite legitimate for scholars studying the Vaartikakaara and Bhaa.syakaara pronouncements to characterize some of the pronouncements as involving lak.sa.naa or vya;njanaa, regardless of whetherthe Vaartikakaara and Bhaa.syakaara were aware of more than one mode of conveying or subscribed to a theory that advocated modes beyond abhidhaa. In fact, the Mahaabhaa.sya commentators do speak of certain words or uses aslaak.sa.nika (e.g. under Paa.nini 1.1.57, Kaiya.ta says a:nga-;sabdena prattyaasattir lak.syate and Anna.m-bha.tta explains this with lak.sa.naa-biijam aaha). Later, in his Ma;njuu.saa, Naage;sa accepts vya;njanaa as a part of the Vaiyaakara.na theory.

  

Moreover, if the lak.sa.naa accepted in the interpretation of the ;saastras includes prayojanavatii lak.sa.naa, it would be difficult to keep vya;njanaa out (as Mamma.ta suggests). Many dyotakas accepted by the Bhaa.syakaara and others can be viewed as indications of the acceptance ofprayojanavatii [lak.sa.na](http://lak.sa.na) if not of vya;njanaa. This does not imply that they were aware of additional modes of linguistic communication \*as a part of theory\* or that they subscribed to a two-mode or three-mode theory. They were just using language as one normally uses it.
