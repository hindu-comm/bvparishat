Respected sir,

Theme of my post was not of acceptance or rejection of Vyanjanainshastras other thanKaavyashastra. The query was on generating Vyanjana meanings fromanySHASTRA-VAKYA. In other words, whether we can take very Shastric sentences as examples for Vyanjana- that was the focal point of my question.Prof. Prof.Korada Subrahmanyamhas said that it is possible to get vyanjana meanings from Shastravaakyas particularly, sentences of Bhashya. Hismentioningthe word Jnaapaka (means vyanjaka)is correct.Hehas not only cited one or two sutras ofPanini but also some sentences of BhartrHari and Nagesha by analizing whichone canunderstand that Vyanjana-meanings can be obtained even fromsutra.Before reading his post I was thinking that Vyanjana vritti is possible only in pure literature and not Shastra vakyas(including sentences of Kavyashastra!). Now, I have got definite answer.
