Vyanjana is not the copyright of kaavyasastrins. If you accept the norm of the grammarians, they are concerned only with the word and its formation. They are less concerned about the deeper meaning as kaavyasastrin thinks. Then the grammarian should only accept abhidhaa and no other Vrtti. Laksana and Vyanjana had been entering different sastras whereas they were not the original vrtti of their sastras. e.g. Laksana in Mimamsa. That is why, isvarodbhavitaa and isvaraanudbhaavita is accepted in poetics. the first vrtti is exclusively used for Mimamsa. But later laksanaa also entered Mimamsa. Siddhicandra Gani in Kavyaprakasakhandanam has offered a few comments to refute laksana and vyanjana. Similar case is with Taatparya. It may be investigated in details with chronology. Patanjali accepts any norm known to loka. Regards, spnarang
