It is like thinkingशुबस्य as Sanskrit, whileशीघ्रम looks like Sanskrit.

  

"महाजनो येन गतः स पन्थाः" is the proverb for such usages popular among the common people. There is no specific meaning apparently in the phrase even if the above is made good by correction as शुभस्य शीघ्रम् as some learned Purohita-s use it with their knowledge.

  

The counter part of this is "आलस्यममृतं विषम्" which also doesn't have apparent syntactical structure for a Sanskrit sentence.

  

The idea has to be surmised from their usage, they are used to hurry up people in order to get things done in proper time. Otherwise, they will not only futile, but may sometimes have adverse effects.

  

This I thought of these sayings.

  

More learned scholars of the group may come up with different sources to support this usage. Welcome to such attempts.

  

With regards
