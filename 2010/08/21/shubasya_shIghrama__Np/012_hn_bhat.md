Here is one more verse for it:

  

महाजनस्य संसर्गः कस्य नोन्नतिकारकः?

  

पुष्पमालानुषङ्गेण सूत्रं शिरसि धार्यते॥

or

पद्मपत्रस्थितं तोयं धत्ते मुक्ताफलश्रियम्॥

  

I hope this is quite enough for the meaning of Great people or शिष्टाः\|

  

महाजनद्विष्ट् and राजद्विष्ट people are referred to in Ayurvedic treatises also a. Many more references are to be found in DCS online dictionary with context.
