I found the same in the Vanaparva of Gorakhpur Edition of Mahabharata, in the Ch.313.117 of AaraNeyaParva in the conversation between the Dharma in the form of Yaksha and Dharmaraja exactly as you have said. This is the reply to the question of the Yaksha as to कः पन्थाः?

  

I think your way of treating this also fine as यद् यदाचरति "श्रेष्ठस्तत्तदेवेतेरो जनः"।

  

"शुभस्य शीघ्रम्, अशुभस्य कालहरणम्" has been commented in some web page with the अद्घ्याहार of कर्मणः, efficiently.

  

The desire to do Good Acts (auspicious) should be implemented implemented immediately without postponing. But if any undesirable act we are unable to avoid under circumstances, it should be postponed in the hope of favorable circumstances may turn up without doing it. This seems to be justifying.

  

We could well supplement कार्यस्य also in the phrases.

  

The other saying, could be modified as

  

आलस्यादममृतं विषम् or आलस्येनामृतं विषम् 

  

to give a tenable meaning. अलसस्य भावः कर्म वा आलस्यम्।

  

Hope this satisfies the query of the member. But source could not be found. I found the above explained in a web page:

  

जब रावण मर रहे थे उस वक्त रामजी ने कहा कि आप अभिज्ञ राजा हैं, आप मुझको कुछ उपदेश दीजिए तो रावण ने कहा-’शुभस्य शीघ्रम, अशुभस्य कालहरणम्’। जब शुभकर्म करने की ख्वाहिश हो तो तुरंत करो, एक मुहूर्त की भी देर नहीं होनी चाहिए, और जब अशुभकर्म करने की इच्छा हो तो केवल देर करो, आज नहीं काल, काल नहीं परसों

But could not verify the statement in Valmiki's Ramayana.

Somebody may try to find the source.
