\> "महाजनो येन गतः स पन्थाः" is the proverb for such usages popular among the  
\> common people. There is no specific meaning apparently in the phrase even if  
\> the above is made good by correction as शुभस्य शीघ्रम् as some learned  
\> Purohita-s use it with their knowledge.

I have seen महाजनो येन गतः स पन्थः given as part of the following  
(said to be in the Vana-Parva of the Mbh., though I cannot locate it  
in the BORI edition):

तर्कोऽप्रतिष्ठः श्रुतयो विभिन्नाः नासौ ऋषिर्यस्य मतं न भिन्नम् \|  
धर्मस्य तत्त्वं निहितं गुहायां महाजनो येन गतः स पन्थः \|\|

This would appear to have more to do with शिष्टाचार, along the same  
lines as the Bhagavad Gita's

यद्यदाचरति श्रेष्ठः तत्तदेवेतरो जनः \|  
स यत्प्रमाणं कुरुते लोकस्तदनुवर्तते \|\|
