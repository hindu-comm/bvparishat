सभायै नाम:

I came across this phrase शुबस्य शीघ्रम while talking to somebody. I  
searched in internet about this phrase, couldn't get more info except  
I can see this phrase is popularly used across India. I am wondering  
whether this a part of subhashita/sloka or is this just a phrase.

धन्यवाद:  
Srikanth.
