I also didn't refer to the Critical Edition, but it is said by some member that the verse itself is not found in the Critical Edition. It may be found in the Pada-index if not in the accepted text, in the variant readings.

  

But I found the same verse with the same reading in two editions the Gorakhpur Editionand in the portion of Yaksha prashna compiled for a text book (the source is different than Gorakhpur edition) and another edition from Bangalore with the first paada as:

  

"तर्को ऽप्रतिष्ठ: श्रुतयो विभिन्नाः"

===========

  

संप्रति वार्ताः श्रूयन्ताम्।

  

"का च वार्तिका?"



अस्मिन् महामोहमये कटाहे

सूर्याग्निना रात्रिदिवेन्धनेन।

मासर्तुदर्वीपरिघट्टनेन

भूतानि कालः पचतीति वार्ता॥

  

This is the news for all given by Dharmaraja.
