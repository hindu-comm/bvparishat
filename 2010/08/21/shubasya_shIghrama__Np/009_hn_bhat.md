Dear Bhattacharya,

  

Thanks for coming up with a different variant for the first पाद verse. Anyhow I had consulted the Gorakpur Edition for the above reading exactly as above. It is the answer given by Dharmaraja to the question of Yaksha: कः पन्थाः?

  

The complete set of question is this:

  

को मोदते? किमाश्चर्यम्? कः पन्थाः? का च वार्तिका?।

  

in the previous portion. It seems to mean that the path of great people or majority of public (?crowd) is to be (simply) followed.

  

There is some story I remember, that applying "Mahajano yena gataH sa panthaH" one reached to burial ground following the path of the crowd in a procession taking a dead man and when all of the relatives had returned afterward he was left alone with an ass grazing there. Then he thought of the saying, "राजद्वारे श्मशाने च यस्तिष्ठति स बान्धवः।". This may be an example for the misuse of proverbs in the wrong contexts. I don't remember the exact story.

  

In many contexts the term used in the sense of the majority of public or the crowd (or little more extended use may give the meaning of "the main stream" of people).
