प्रणम्य  
Thanks a million for leading/directing the efforts from  
anvayaklesha to arthaanusandhaanam.  
This analysis also throws light on the need of VyAkaraNam as an essential tool  
for arriving at the meanings of any sUtra Text. An English/Sanskrit Dictionary would  
prove a very poor tool to substitute the internalized VyAkaraNam as a ready reckoner.

**\>VairAgya** is of two types - **AparavairAgya** and

**ParavairAgya .  
Is the ParavairAgya the same ensuing state of buddhi   
when रसोप्यस्य परम् दृष्ट्वा निवर्तते ?  
A request:  
A Paper on Yogic Psychology by you during the forthcoming Conference  
On Veda Vidya(21-23 Jan.2011) would be of immense value.
