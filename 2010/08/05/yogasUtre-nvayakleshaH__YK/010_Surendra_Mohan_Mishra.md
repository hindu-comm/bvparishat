Yes,to my best understanding the Gita passage quoted corresponds to the state of para-vairaagya as said in the Yogasuutras : tat param purushakhyaater guNavaitrishNyam ."Vishyaa vinivartante niraahaarasya dehinah' refers to yatamaanasamjnaa and vyatirekasamjnaa types of vairaagya and 'rasavarjam' implies ekendriyasamjnaa where the longing still remains in subtle form in the mind alone.But 'raso'pyasya param drishTvaa nivartate' speaks of the highest state where one has had the vision of sattva-purushaanyataakhyaati already achieved.Regards,SMMishra
