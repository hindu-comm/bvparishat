**Following the comm. of VyAsa on the YogasUtra 1.1.1 as " yogah samAdhih,sa cha sArvabhaumashchittasya dharmah etc. ", scholars have mostly accepted the root " yuj samAdhau " as the basis of the word "yoga" as used by Patanjali.So also the word "Yoga" in PAshupata etc. systems have taken resort to "yujir yoge"to derive the same word as there it involves a union of the individual self with the universal Self or Ishvara.  
  
Another way of deriving the same word could be from "yuj prich samyamane" coming in PANini's DhAtupATha ChurAdigaNa.  
  
I think all these senses are contextually applicable to the sense in which Patanjali uses the word "Yoga" as it is contemplation,union with(establishment in) essential self and all the way self-control in the form of cessation of the mental modifications.  
  
Best regards,
