namo vidvadbhyah



A brief explanation to the question related to **Bhagavadgita** --



**visayA vinivartante nirAhArasya dehinah I rasavarjam raso'pyasya param drstvA nivartate II (2-59)**



all the things, except **RAga (due to Rajas**),will be away from a person who keeps himself aloof from the enjoyment / experience of sense-organs. That kind of Asakti will also run away as soon as one gets the **BrahmasAksAtkAra .**



**Yogasutras :**

**drstAnusravikavisayavitrsnasya vasIkArasamjnA vairAgyam (1-15) and tatparam purusakhyAtergunavaitrsnyam (1-16)**



The vasIkaranabuddhi in terms of asceticism pertaining to matters of Drsta and Anusravika is **(aparam**)**VairAgyam** . The

**param VairAgyam** is the ascetism in terms of 'sakalagunas' , achieved thru repeated visits of **Purusa** .



No doubt, **AparavairAgya is the cause of ParavairAgya** . Even after achieving AparavairAgya there will be ' rajolesa '

(**rasa in GitA**) ., i.e. VairAgya is there in 'visayas' due to Dosadarsana but not in 'JnAna" (because still ' **sattva** ' etc.are there ) . So it is called **ParavairAgya** due to total **JnAnaprasAda .**



**JnAna** has also got some **Dosas** but it is required for **AvidyAnivrtti,** which is in turn useful for **VairAgyam .**



Therefore, as was commented by other Scholars, both the texts teach / preach , more or less,the same concept

In ParavairAgya the Gunas are completely gone .



One may quote the following **SAmkhyakArikA** also (45) (the **Samjnas** are taken from **Samkhyadarsanam**):



**'VairAgyAt prakrtilayah samsAro bhavati rAjasAdrAgAt'**

  
In the above line '**rAjasAt**' and '**rAgAt** ' - both are not required . Either is redundant .
