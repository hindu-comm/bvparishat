Respected Murthy Sir and other Scholars,  
  
Thank you very much for this important explanation about meters. Here you mention two books (1) Vritta Ratnakara & (2) Chando Manjari.  
I have searched both books on internet and found Vritta Ratnakara in digital form.  
But I am unable to download Chando Manjari. Though it is available on Google books, link is here-  
<http://books.google.co.in/books/about/Chando_manjari.html?id=7SI1AQAAMAAJ&redir_esc=y>  
but how to download Google books? Can and other technical experts would like to explain?  
  
Regards
