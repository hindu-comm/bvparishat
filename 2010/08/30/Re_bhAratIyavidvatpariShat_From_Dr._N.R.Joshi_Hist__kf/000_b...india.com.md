Respected scholars,  
  
I am very sorry to use such language but the attempt of Respected Shree N.R.Joshi to determine the the date of Mahabharata from the writing of some Franklin Edgarton (who, from his name, appears to be an European ) is simply absurd.  
  
I wonder why knowledgeable scholars look for answers from others, particularly Europeans who can never understand the Indian scriptures, Ponchang etc. which are common knowledge even among the illiterate rural people of India.  
  
It is very clearly stated not only in Mahabharata but also in quite a few other books known as Puranas that Kaliyugabda, which is still in use, started 36 years after the battle of Kurukshetra. The year April 2010 - March 2011 AD is the year 5112 in Kaliyugabda. Accordingly the battle took place in the year 3118 BC.  
  
This statement is corroborated by numerous statements on the positions of the stars and planets. However determining the date from these statements relating to astronomy show a date which differs by about 70 years. It is evident that this difference is due to the corrections made to the Indian as well as Julian and Gregorian calendars during the last 5000 years.  
  
Thus it is also clear that the upper Harappan Civilization (from 3100 to 1600 BC). Thus it is obvious that the civilization described in Mahabharata refers to that period. Any serious scholar should look for the names of places among the names extant at that time.  
  
Yours truly,  
  
D.D.Misra
