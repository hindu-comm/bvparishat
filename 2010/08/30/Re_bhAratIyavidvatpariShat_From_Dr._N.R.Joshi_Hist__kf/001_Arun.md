There is a beautiful verse describing such research by mutual quoting-  
अविद्यायामन्तरे वर्तमानाः स्वयं धीराः पण्डितं मन्यमानाः ।  
दन्द्रम्यमाणाः परियन्ति मूढा अंधेनैव नीयमाना यथान्धाः । (कठोपनिषद्  
1/2/5)  
All such researchers are totally ignorant of any calendar system and  
have not heard about even Vikrama samvat or Shalivahana Shaka which is  
known to at least 10 persons in each village of India. But they pose  
as scholars and beat their own drums. They are moving in circles-i.e.  
one ignorant quoting other among the group. This is like one blind  
leading the other-Arun
