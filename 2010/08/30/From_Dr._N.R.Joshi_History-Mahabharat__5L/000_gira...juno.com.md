Respected Scholars, Namaste!

Forwarded message ,"Lessons on Mahabharart" by Dr. Tirumal Kulkarni is nice to see. The included map is full of details. I have questions to scholars of Mahabharat.  
(1) I do not get information from Mahabharat scholars of India on countries outside of the subcontinent at the time of Mahabharat war, espacially countries on the immediate west of the subcontinent.  
(2) Different authors offer different dates for Mahabharat war and even for composition of the epic.  
(3) Recently in my trip to India I copied a page from "The SabhAparvan" edited by Franklin Edgerton (Poona, 1944 BORI). In the description of different countries (2.28.49), there comes "Antaakheem caiva Romaan ca yavanaanaam puram tathaa". The author claims that Antaakhee is city of Antioch established by Selucas Nikator in Turkey around 350 BC and Romaa was the cityof Roma, Italy. Conclusion; Mahabharat cannot have been composed any time before the first century BC. Thanks. N.R.Joshi
