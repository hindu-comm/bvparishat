Indeed it is a very good news. Congratulations !



But care must be taken from the beginning itself to present it in **idiomatic sanskrit**. ThereFirst few years should be devoted to create a **standard** by focussing on knolwdge contents in Indian intellectual traditions to acquaint the common man with their heitage.There is a very **big gap** here.



For general public there should be a Column for learning Sanskrit language based on Contrastive methodofmodern linguistics.



**Rationality must prevail over immotionality. Nothing should be claimed without an evidence. Special effort should be made to demonstrate scientifically the relationship and relevance of sanskrit to modern Indian languages, literature, artandculture providing due space for multi-cultural and multi-lingual dialogue for enduring national integration. I see a great future for this daily, if this approach is adopted.**



Sudharma **of Mysore should also be revived in the same line.**



**I wish the editors all the best !**
