Dear Sri Bhattacharyaji,  
Namaste. Many thanks for the discussion. I am not at all tired of the  
details. In fact I only asked for it! On the other hand it is possible  
my questions may be elementary and trivial for learned scholars. My  
traditional Sanskrit training did not go beyond Laghu Kaumudi,  
Nyaayamuktavali and a few others, that too five decades ago. But my  
interest in unearthing scientific information in ancient Sanskrit  
literature is intact and continuing. Since Vedic literature poses  
difficulties even with the help of commentaries (western English  
translations could be misleading and wrong) I took courage to post my  
doubt on this group. I know that Vedic language need not follow  
PaaNinian structures. But, meanings of several Vedic metaphors,  
anecdotes, legends and even numbers are sometimes better preserved in  
later literature, even if they were to be allegorical. Hence my long  
standing doubt about the word mImAmsa and its analytical derivation  
from the root. I hope members of the group bear with me.

\> The Pāṇinīya prakriyā on mīmāṃsā is clear from the discussion. No doubt ‘thinking’ is in the meaning. However, one point remains. The root mān stated by Pāṇini himself as the root is a sautra root. That is to say it is not found out outside the specific case mentioned by Pāṇini. Usually such roots are invented to explain a particular form. That means that they are not inferred by the sāmānya-viśeṣa process advised by Patañjali. You will find the same method of improvisation in the Uṇādi-Sūtras where single pratyayas have been invented for single words. Similarly, the roots kṛṇv and dhinv (dhinvikṛvyor a ca) had been invented, again by the sage himself, to explain two stray formations -- the Pañcaviṃśa-Brāhmaṇa’s adhinvīt and the Paippalāda-Saṃhitā’s kṛṇva. The reason was that the vikaraṇa –nu- is not available with the root kṛ in the kṛt-formation kṛṇva and with dhi the aorist  
\> formation adhinvīt. Some later commentators extended the root’s use by imaginary forms like cakṛṇva because they failed to understand why Pāṇini had envisaged the root kṛṇv. It comes to the following -- the root mān is an impropvised i.e. case-specific sautra root invented in order to explain the irregular –ā- in mīmāṃsā and that its ultimate origin in man मन् can be guessed.
