The fact is that **Vacaspati**in **Bhamati (Sankarabhasyam 1-1-1**) says that it can be either **mAn(kavarga**) = **mAne or mAna = pUjAyAm** . Both, **Bhattoji and Nagesa** tried to somehow (because it is not in line with **Mahabhasyam** and one should not forget the dictum - **trimuni vyakaranam**) support **Bhamati** (**Praudhamanorama and Brhacchabdendu) .**



**Bhattoji** in this context completely follows **Kasika (Nyasa and Padamanjari** too) . He, in **Praudhamano** ,quotes **Vakyapadiyam - upeyapratipattyarthA upAyA avyavasthitAh** (**Vakyakanda**).



If anything goes wrong it is stated clearly - there is no such a word like **'kusA' (strIlinga**) , according to

**Vacaspati** but it is there in **Veda - pramAdo dhImatAmapi** . That'swhy **Patanjali** caushioned **'asti aprayukta** **iti vacanam sAhasamAtrameva'** . The word was **registered by Panini** .



**MAna means VicAra (pUjitavicAra according to Ratnaprabha, Bhamati 1-1-1**) . If one wants to prefer ' '**man**' then the question will be ' **arke cenmadhu vindeta kimartham parvatam vrajet** ?' . If there is some **Pramana** one can take it (**Mahabhasyam,Kasika, Nyasa,Padamanjary,Kaumudi, Praudhamanorama,Sekhara** etc) .



**SautradhAtu** also can be considered if there is sanction and requirement .



**PrakriyA** should be **'ksodaksama**' . There are differences - according to **Patanjali** the term **'uttama' (aniyohranArsayh 4-1-78**) is an '**avyutpannaprAtipadika**' . **Sridhara** in his commentatry **(Bhagavata-1**) says it is - **udgatam tamah yasmAt sah** . There are many examples - **'amAvAsyA**' etc.  
  
In **TaittirIyAranyaka (Arunam**) it is there - **vAsistho rauhino mImAgmsAm cakre** . In **KAthaka**s - **saisA**

**mImAgmsA agnihotra eva sampannA** .
