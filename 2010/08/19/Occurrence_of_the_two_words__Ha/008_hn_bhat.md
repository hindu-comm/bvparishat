Dear Madhavji,

  

I don't understand what you are intending to do with the collection of usages of these two words.

  

You can download the Subhashitabhandagara from the archives. Here is the link:

  

<http://www.archive.org/details/SubhashitaRatnaBhandagara>

  

And just put your query for these words in DCS and you will 391 occurrences with sources for Ekaika and 29 references for itaretara from their data-base. You can verify the references with any edition available and verify them. Here is the link:

  

<http://kjc-fs-cluster.kjc.uni-heidelberg.de/dcs/index.php?contents=abfrage>

  

You can yourself put the query and get the results yourself.

  

With regards
