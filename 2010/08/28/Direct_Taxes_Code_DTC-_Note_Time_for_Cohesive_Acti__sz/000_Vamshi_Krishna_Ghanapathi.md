Dear Colleague Scholars!  
  
Pranaam. Most of us involved in one or another charitable, Dharmik, Religious or Academic Activities. Many of us involved with one or another organisations. Many organisations in the allied fields collaborate to conduct programs/ activities.  
  
In this connection, I would like to draw your intention to the provisions/ clauses in the proposed Direct Taxes Code (DTC) cleared by Central Cabinet recently. It is slated to replace the existing income tax act.  
  
A detailed note on the likely impact and possible solutions are mentioned in the note. This is to urge all of you to approach public representatives (MPs), known to you; to explain the forthcoming difficulties for Dharmik Organisations, in view of this enactment. State Ministers and MLA may also be informed to join the representation.  
  
Since, the Parliament is set to discuss the same Bill, our inputs/ representation/ appeals to the MPs are important in shaping up the Act. Our zeal at this stage will certainly protect the illustrious organisations rendering excellent service to the society by upholding Dharma.  
  
Kindly read the attachment and do the needful.  
  
With Warm Regards  
Vamshi K Ghanapathi
