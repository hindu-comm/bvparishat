Respected Scholars, Namaskar!

" DEAR SIR  
IT WAS A VERY HAPPY NEWS. THERE ARE SEVERAL  
VERSIONS OF MAHABHARATA. WHICH IS RELIABLE IN YOUR VIEW. I SUGGEST YOU TO FOCUS YOUR RESEARCH ON THE ESSENCE OF MAHABHARATA.  
IT IS CRITICIZED AS A STORY OF A WAR BETWEEN TWO KINGDOMS.

There is war between two parties in Mahabharat. It is left to individual authors how they look at Mahabharat. Some will praise it, others criticize it..So many other authors have written on the Essence of Mahabharat. I came across Mahabharat in order to find out whether Sanskrit came to India from the countries west of the Indian subcontinent. So I started examining the ancient histories of all the western countries. During that research I came across connection of Mahabharat nations to areas outside (to the west) of India. On this subject I gave talks in India-  
" Evidence of Mahabharat from countries outside of the subcontinent".At one place after listening to my lecture, one from audience asked question about Krishna. I showed my last slide on Krisna and said it is very difficult to talk. In order to understand the ancient history of India (before 600 BC), in my opinion, one should study the ancient history of her ancient neighbors, such as Afghanistan.Persia and Arabia. Think for minute-if we find the most important place associated with Krishna's last days outside of the subcontinent, then what will happen? All this comes in my Mahabharat book. Thanks. N.R.Joshi
