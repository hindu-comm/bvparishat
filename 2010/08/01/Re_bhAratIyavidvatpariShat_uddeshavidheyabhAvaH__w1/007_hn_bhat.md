Dear Bhattacharya,

  

You have raised an important aspect of the question.

  

Literally the primary meaning of the verb is given as दिशिरुच्चरणे and it is well known that the धात्वर्थ transforms with or without prefixation as clearly illustrated by the popular verse:

  

उपसर्गेण धात्वर्थो बलादन्यत्र नीयते।प्रहार-आहार-संहार-विहार-परिहार वत्।

  

and the maxim conveniently used by the commentators:

  

"धातूनामनेकार्थत्वात्" ।

  

In this case also उद्देश has been conveniently interpreted as उपदेश in the context of grammar text and specifically with the maxim "यथोद्देशं संजापरिभाषम्" as verified by the quotations from the related texts by our learned versatile scholar friend Mr. Subrahmanya Korada drawing on Mahabhashya and Vakyapadiya with ready made references.

  

Yet, I hope it would not be out place if I place my humble opinion with his permission. As both are derived from the same verb दिश with the same prefix उद्. with two different primary suffixes one in the active and the other in the passive voice, उद्देश and उद्देश्य differ by their usage in different contexts, but could have the same literal and literary meaning also. Literally if we follow the grammarians' explanation it is Upadesha. Literary meaning of statement of intention (or intended उद्देश्य = लक्ष्य) is accepted in other contexs. It is this meaning, I hope popularised उद्देश्य-विधेय-भाव acceptable syntactic relation which should be corresponding roughly to the Subject and predication of English Sentence order which more important in those languages for obtatining the meaning.And for Sanskrit, it doesn't apply mutatis mutandis any how as every declined form or conjugated form will have its own meaning attached irrespective of its position or order it is placed in a sentence. To quote Kunjunni Raja it roughly corresponds to the western concept of Subject Predication, but there are differences also particularly it is not obligatory for Sanskrit sentences. But how it came to be attached to Poetical appreciation seems to be the majority of later Rhetoricians were either strong Mimamsaka-s or Naiyayika-s like Mukulabhatta, and Mahimabhatta. As for lexicographers, "लक्षीकरोति चोद्दिशति चोद्देशे" उद्दिशति and लक्षीकरोति are synonymous verbs and mean the same thing, which settles the literary meaning for the verb दिश prefixed with उद् in favour of the general usage. The target and the object targeted would be the convenient meaning for उद्देश and उद्देश्य where they coincide and correspondence with subject and predication lies in that much.

  

It can be taken in this sense, the prominently projected part of the sentence, which would be retaken later to complete the sentence. (अनुवाद्य). Thus it would amount the prominent place उद्देश (elevated position). It is accepted in Grammar also in explaining the यथोद्देशपक्ष and कार्यकालपक्ष। I don't just remember.

  

We can look forward to Mr.Subrahmanya Korada to come up with more testimonies either in support or otherwise of this line of thinking.

This is only my humble submission for further consultation.

  

With regards
