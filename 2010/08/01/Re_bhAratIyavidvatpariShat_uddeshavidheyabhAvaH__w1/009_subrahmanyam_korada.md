thank you very much Bhattah . More or less I too said the same but after sending the message I saw your posting . You gave a really nice explanation .



The credit should also go to scholars like Jagannatha and Bhattacharya for raising such

discussions . Otherwise, as you may agree with me , profound issues , as are raked up,

will go into oblivion . These postings help many, as I understand, to know the secrets of

Sastras .

The founders of BVparishat deserve all praise .



I welcome any comment or criticism from any corner simply to learn more .
