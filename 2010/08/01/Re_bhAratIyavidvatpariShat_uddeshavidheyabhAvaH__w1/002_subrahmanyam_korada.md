**PUrvamImAmsA --** **YajuhparimAnAdhikaranam**



When the Yajus are there in clusters it is difficult to carve a single Yajuh . It is in such a situation that Jaimini compiles

the following SUtra - arthaikatvAdekam vAkyam sAkAnksam dedvibhAge syAt - if a single thing is proposed or if a single

meaning is expressed and when separated if the parts are found to be wanting then it is a VAkyam .



Here instead of the word 'Yajuh' , Jaimini employed ' VAkyam' deliberately . So that the same can be a definition of a

VAkya ( Rk, Yajus, VAkyam etc are synonyms ) .

**Kumarila in Tantravartikam** says - mantrabrAhmanalokesu vaktavyam kvopayujyate .

Jaimini did not insert the word ' Padam" so that it can be a definition of MahAvAkyam also .

EkavAkyatA (arthaikatvam) is being injuncted by this SUtra .

AkAnksA and YogyatA are not mentioned as they are implied .



This is - **Ekoddesyaka - ekavidheyakatvagarbham ekavAkyatAlaksanam.**



**ArunAdhikaranam** - In **Taittiriyasamhita** (6-1-6), **Jyotistomaprakarana** the following sentence is there regarding Somakraya - arunayA pingAksyA ekahAyanyA somam krInAti .

There is not much to discuss about - pingAksyA and ekahAyanyA as they are in BahuvrIhi and as such construed with

Dravya .

The discussion is about ' arunayA' - following VAkyapramAnam (ekavAkyatA / arthaikatvam) it , thru 'ekahAyanyA' applies

into ' somakraya' (AmnAyasya kryArthatvAt) or following PrakaranapramAna , having separated applies to Dravya -

arunayA dravyam bhAvayet .

SiddhAnta is EkavAkyatA -- here is JaiminisUtrm - arthaikatve dravyagunayoh aikakarmyAt niyamassyAt (3-1-6-12) .



If 'arunayA' is separated then the 'arthaikatva ' is disturbed and it is a 'dosa'(defect)called ' VAkyabheda '. In **SlokavArtikam, VAkyAdhikaranam, Kumarila** says - sambhavatyekavAkyatve vAkyabhedastu nesyate .



There are **two Niyamas** - Pratyekam vAkyaparisamAptih and SamudAye vAkyaparisamAptih- in **UddesyavidheyabhAva** .



**Pratyekam vAkyaparisamAptih** : devadattayajnadattavisnumitrAh bhojyantAm . Here each of them is given food .



**SamudAye vAkyaparisamAptih :** gargAh satam dandyantAm . Here collectively Gargas have to pay hundred .



The above analysis falls under ' pratyekam vAkyasamApti' and it is VAkyabheda (anekavidhito hi vAkyabhedah - Kuma)-

ekahAyanyA krInAti and arunayA krInAti . It happens by Avrtti of the kriyA , i.e. krInAti .



The SiddhAnta is that PratyekaparisamApti does not cause VAkyabheda . Since 'Aruna ' is a Guna (gunAnAm ca parArthatvAt - Jaimini) it qualifies the PradhAna ( gunah krtAtmasamskArah pradhAnam pratipadyate - Kum)



Finally here since the Vakyam denotes 'visesanavisistakraya' and therefore it is 'SamudAyaparisamApti' rather than

'PratyekaparisamApti .



**Vyakaranam :**



Under ' upadese'janunAsika it' (Panini 1-3-3), Patanjali discusses the terms - upadesa and uddesa . In fact both are used

as synonyms . But Patanjali rules - pratyaksamAkhyAnam upadesah , gunaih prApanam uddesah . Except in 'Adeca upadese'siti'( Pan 6-1-45) the above definition is not applied across Astadhyayi .



Uddesya ( arhe krtytrcasca , Pan 3-3-169, yat) and uddesa ( akrtari ca kArake samjnAyAm , Pan3-3-19, ghan) are

synonyms .



In cases like 'vrddhirAdaic, (Pan 1-1-1) it is PratyekaparisamApti . Each of A,Ai and Au is called Vrddhi .



In cases like 'halo'nantarAssamyogah'(Pan 1-1-7) , SamAsa, ubhe abhyastam (Pan6-1-5) it is SamudAyeparisamAptih .



In cases like 'atkupvAnnumvyavAye'pi ' (Pan 8-4-2) it is both , i.e samastAh vyastA vA .



**VAkyArthah : '** VrajAni devadatta !' - is a VAkya where we have to
supply with the word ' jAnIhi' . Here if there is no UddeesyavidheyabhAva then it cannot be a 'samAnavAkya' and there cannot be 'nighAta' (anudAttasvarah) by the

vArtika - samAnavAkye nighAtayusmadasmadAdesAh ( tinnatinah, Pan8-1-28) . Therefore **Bhartrhari** ruled as follows -



sambodhanapadam yacca tatkriyAyA visesanam I vrajAni devadatteti nighAto'tra bhavisyati II (**Vakyapadiyam , 2-5**).



**Nagesa in SubarthavicAra in Laghumanjusa** says the following - tatra vrajanasya karmatvAddevadattasya uddesyatvAt ubhayoh samAnavAkyasthatvam uddesyavidheyabhAvo vAkyArthah .



**Patanjali** discusses PratyekaparisamApti and SamudAyeparisamApti under ' VrddhirAdaic'(Pan 1-1-1) etc.



Here are more verses from**Vakyapadiyam :**

**samghaikasesadvandvesu kecitsAmarthyalaksanam I pratyAsrayamavasthAnam kriyAnAm pratijAnate II(2-371)**

**bhojanam phalarUpAbhyAm ekaikasmin samApyate I anyathA hi vyavasthAne na tadarthah prakalpate II (2-372)**

**annadAnAdirUpAm ca sarve trptiphalAm bhujim I pratyekam pratipadyante na tu nAtyakriyAmiva II (2-373)**
