namo vidvadbhyah



the meaning of a root undergoes change when an upasarga is prefixed . uddesa , which is ghananta as

well as uddesya, which is yadanta both are used in the sense of a thing that is the base of some application .

The relation is called uddesyavidheyabhAva . We do not come across ' uddesavidheyabhava' .

The meaning has to be decided depending on the context . Upadesa and Uddesa are discussed as synonyms.



A thing can be taken thru Parisamkhya (not necessarily uccArita) and that also is considered as uddesa or

uddesya . All such things are there in big commentaries and difficult to mention on a platform like this for obvious

reasons .  
The problem here is that the discussion is purely SAstrIya and unless it is raised we do not go to the details .

In fact , most of the people are not aware of the nuanses of the topic.



No doubt , any aspect can be taken (such as vrajAni devadatta ) and the BhAva can be appliedand here the

general sense of UddesyavidheyabhAva does not apply . In my first response I took care to avoid confusion .



Let us not take another language for comparison or make it a seapate topic .



'Disa = uccArane ' should not be taken as it is to interpret 'uddesa' etc. as the usage of a term in a sense is

the final authority . Sometimes the exact meaning may be there embedded and at times it may be the shade

of meaning .
