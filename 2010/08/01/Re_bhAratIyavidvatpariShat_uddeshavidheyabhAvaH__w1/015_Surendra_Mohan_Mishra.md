**This is possible that uddesha is saadhana and uddeshya is saadhya ,but in sastric parlance this doesn't seem to have been adopted.The ghan suffix in 'uddesha' allows a number of meanings out of which 'uddeshya' also is one.  
Ut = Uddhritya Deshah = Kathanam : thus it means to particularly highlight some topic or discuss it in a given perspective.  
Wittgenstein said that most of our philosophical discussion is due to misunderstanding of language.We have to a large extent lost touch with idiomatic Samskrit which is at the root of the technical reformulation and specific stipulation of certain words in the shAstras.  
But happily the BVP postings are reinventing some of the ideas of our great scholiasts and suiting them to our contemporary understanding and needs.
