I do believe in the lost institutions. Can some scholar explain the logical social link of this institution i.e. to bring the husband of the daughter and get the putresti yajna done? In Panjab, in a few folk songs of Panjab such institution is visible including the son of the daughter. As in south, marriage with the daughter of the sister exists, it may be something like that. Has some scholar Westermarck's book on marriage? we may get a clue there. Regards, spnarang
