Dear Sir,

  

He has already mentioned the source in his post:

It is Mahabharata Vanaparava Adhyaya-s 110-115 as I checked in Gorakhpur Edition. It contains the story up to the bringing in Rshyashringa to Lomapada-s kingdom to thwart away dearness.

  

The other part belongs to Ramayana Balakanda, at the counsel of Sumantra, Dasaratha brings Rshyashringa to get Putrakameshti performed. I had given the reference in some other topic relating to Putrakameshti.

  

With regards
