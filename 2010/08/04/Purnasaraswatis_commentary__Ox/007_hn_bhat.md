Thanks for the information which is news to me. I know Meghaduta as a poem lyric. And, hope there may be some intellectual who might have been able to read Spiritual knowlege and Tantric application through it.

  

I have not heard of it.

  

Raghuvamsha had an advaitic interpretation in some commentary I found in among the catalogues, but not published.
