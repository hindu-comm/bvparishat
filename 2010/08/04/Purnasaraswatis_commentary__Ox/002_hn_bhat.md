Sorry I mentioned to add that he is a poet himself and a versatile commentator as is in my previous message without necessity of it. And he belonged to Dashanami-school of the Advaita- muth-s having the name as sarasvati just like Madhusudhana-saraswati.

  

His propensity and profundity in Advaita philosophy caqn be seen in his Bhaktimandakini commentary on Vishnupadaadi-kesha-stotra ascribed to Sri Sankara which again is a beautiful presentation of the form of Vishnu as popularized by the Purana-s and PS is ready there to provide you with the relevant descriptions from the Purana-s.
