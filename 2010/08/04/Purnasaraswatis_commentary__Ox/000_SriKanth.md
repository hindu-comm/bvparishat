मान्या:  
  
नमस्ते. I came across this name Purnasaraswati while reading about  
Bhavabuti's works. Nowhere in internet I could find details about this  
commentator as far as I could search except that one of the book by  
Sri. M.R. Kale on Uttararamacharita is referencing Purnasaraswati's  
commentary.  
  
Could you give me more details about this personality and any books/  
links about him.  
  
धन्यवाद:  
SriKanth!
