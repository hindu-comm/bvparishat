Dear friends,



I consider myself very fortunate for having membership with BVparishat as my questions are being answered by the learned scholars elaborately. So many fresh information I am getting from the posts of the scholars.The views are divergent because of the various thinking styles. Enthusiastic scholars doprovide examples to a greater extent which cause more length in responses. Space is of not serious concern here as this is website of Google. We, as the community of researchers are getting a lot of good things from here.I must confess that I remember Shloka of Bhartruhari oftentimes while enjoying the posts of BVparishat:



यदा किञ्चिद्ज्ञोऽहं द्विप इव मदान्धः समभवं



तदा सर्वज्ञोऽस्मीत्यभवदवलिप्तं मम मनः।



यदा किञ्चित् किञ्चिद् बुधजनसकाशादवगतं



तदा मूर्खोऽस्मीति ज्वर इव मदो मे व्यपगतः।।



इति विनयावनतो जगन्नाथः।
