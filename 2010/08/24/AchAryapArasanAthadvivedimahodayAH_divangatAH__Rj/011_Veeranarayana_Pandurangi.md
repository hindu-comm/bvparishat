thanks for your post.



Acarya Parasanatha Dwivedi was a man of classes and not books. He enjoyed teaching more than writing new ones (true to his varanasi tradition), and was one of the remaining very few pandits of thisthis tradition, others being Purushottam tripathi, vashistha tripathi, Ramayatna shukla. no more names come forward. sacchidananda mishra should be knowing more.



in recent years we had close association with Acarya Parasanatha Dwivedi in jrrsu. after his retirement from SSU, he joined JRRSU jaipur. as peethadhyaksha of Meemaamsaa peetha. here he was writing a thesis for UGC sponsored program on review of the important bhasyas of the brahmasutras, which he must have submitted to UGC last year.



his publications include



नयनप्रसादिन्याः समीक्षणम्

वेदान्तपरिभाषा (संपादनम्)

सिद्धान्तलेशसंग्रह (संपादनम्) हिन्दी व्याख्यया सह

विवरणप्रमेयसंग्रह (संपादनम्) हिन्दी व्याख्यया सह

all sampurnananda publications.



the second point prof. Aklujkar raisedis a glaring example for the western neglect of indian works published in sanskrit as well as our own jaadya in getting our works to a good bibliography. There was heated discussion on this point in indology list last year.



even the KH potter bibl which is precisely for the Darshans grosly neglects new arrivals listing only publications in english.
