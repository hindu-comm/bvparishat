thanks for enlighting us on the matter discussed earlier.

however I clarify some points



1\. there were two parasnaths, both beingdvivedins,one who died few years ago was a sahityaka who edited or wrote many things on sahitya that Prof. aklujakar mentioned, other being the person who died now, a vedantin. this namesakeness has created many confusions even in varanasi.



2\. Prof. aklujakarobserved "Another observation I consider relevant in judging the extent of the validity of the 'neglect' judgment is this: many Indian researchers understand pari.skaara or samanvaya of earlier views as research. A Western researcher typically focuses on historical reconstruction (which may turn out to be right or wrong). Consequently, there is less of an occasion to refer to Indian publications."



ok. I agree. veiw points on "what is research" arequite different in india and west.let them do what they want.I dont insist western shcolars to study what parasanathji wrote. but I insist that they should include his works in the bibliography they compile.

f.e. there is no entry of Parasanathji in KH potter bibl (MLBD 1995) which is precisely for the Darshans. there is only one entry in the **website of KH potter bibl** being "Dwivedhi, Parasanath: e809.21.8" that is विवरणप्रमेयसंग्रह (संपादनम्) हिन्दी व्याख्यया सह. I dont understand why other works or neglected. is it because of Princeton has only one book of parasnath? why dont they see sampurnanda catalogue or tirupati catalogue? tirupati catalogue is very much on web. all theses submitted to sansthan are described in sansthan website. why nothing is mentioned in KH potter bibl? this is gross neglect I pointed out. No sanskrit papers published in numerous sanskrit journals are mentioned in **KH potter bibl. but evenenglish papers publihed in religiousenglish journals like Dharmaprakash arelisted in the sameKH potter bibl. is it a mistake to publish in sanskrit? not listing the sanskrit papers is not a casual mistake. it is intentional neglect.** this is gross neglect I pointed out.



3\. I know scholars working in west have good access to their librarie-catalogues (in web). librarie-catalogues follow them everywhere. I did not misunderstand the sentence "I dont have access to Parasanath".



4\. my sentence "the second point prof. Aklujkar raised is a glaring example for the western neglect of indian works published in sanskrit as well as our own jaadya in getting our works to a good bibliography. seems to be misunderstood. My point wasfor thegeneral trend of western institutionalbibliographers towards the indian publications. it was not a personal one.

in india many institutions are doing very good jobs. many are publishing it in websites. many are not. if not, then it is our neglect. but even after putting all the things in website there publications are grossly neglected. I accept there somekind of jaadya in our instituions that is alsocausing problems.  



5\. there is shortage of funds/misuse of funds in indian institutions. we accept it. western universitites have enoug money to buy books as they wish. we acept it also. but then why our western brothers dont send us books free of cost? they should enable indian colleagues to know what is going on in west. because of this neglect/inactivity our indian students (majority of them study through traditional system) are not familiar with kiparsky or cordona, aklujkar or Heauben. they dont know what these people are doing. so I request all the scholars here to do something needfull. धियो यो नः प्रचोदयात् is the motive. few years ago I proposed**a project“a comprehensive Web based Bibliography of ****Samskrita works”** to samsthan. but it did not work. I hope somebody will take that thing and if somebody wants I will send the full proposal.
