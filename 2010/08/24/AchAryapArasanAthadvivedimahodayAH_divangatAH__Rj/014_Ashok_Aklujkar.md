Many thanks to Dr. Pandurangi for the information he has provided. I hope thatAcharya Parasanatha Dwivedi'sreview of the important bhaa.syas of the brahma-suutras will be published soon.

  

My sentence, "I do not have access to any works ofAcharya Parasanatha Dwivedi," should have been clearer. It was written on the background of MrBhagaban Samantaray's sentence, "I am interested to work \[--> interested in working\] with the unpublished manuscripts of Acarya Parasanath Dwivediji." What I primarily meant was, 'I do not have access to any \*unpublished\* works ofAcharya Parasanatha Dwivedi.'

  

Secondly, as I am travellingat present, I had quickly consulted the electronic catalogue of my university library. It did not list any publications under the full author name. When I had more time today during my travel and checked the same catalogue under various spellings of the author name, I discovered, with "Parasanatha" as my keyword, the following publications listed under "Parasanatha Dwivedi" in addition to the ones Dr. Pandurangi has listed:

  

Kāmasūtram : Yaśodharaviracitaya "Jayamaṅgalā" vyākhyayā "Manoramā"-Hindīvyākhyayā ca vibhūṣitam.

  

Rasagaṅgādharah̤ / Paṇḍitarājajagannāthapraṇīto ; Nāgeśabhaṭṭakr̥tayā "Gurumarmaprakāśa" vyākhyayā, ... samalaṅkr̥tah̤.

  

Nāṭyaśāstram / Bharatamunipraṇītaṃ ; Śrīmadabhinavaguptakr̥tayā "Abhinava bhāratī" vyākhyayā, Pārasanāthadvivedikr̥tayā "Manoramā" Hindī-vyākhyayā ca vibhūṣitam.

  

Ācārya Nandikeśvara aura unakā nāṭya-sāhitya.

Dr. Pandurangi commented that the second point in my first communication on the matter was "a glaring example for the western neglect of indian works published in sanskrit as well as our own jaadya in getting our works to a good bibliography." I would like to respond to the first part of this comment by providing some qualifications arising out of my experience of over forty years.

  

(About the second, I am in unqualified agreement. Over the years I have had so many experiences of not receiving any response to my inquiries about this dissertation or that publication, even after writing to registrars or vice-chancellors of Indian universities, that I have no doubt about the second part's truth. What has surprised and saddened me even more is that university academics, by and large, have come to accept this 'jaise the' or status quo situation. Unless an internal \***constructive**\* criticism and suggestions begin to be made, the situation is unlikely to change.)

  

It is true that there has been a Western neglect and that the number of Western Sanskritists comfortable in reading modern Sanskrit works is still small. However, interest in modern Skt has been growing steadily in the West in the last 2-3 decades. If Indian institutions begin to publicize their publications well and regularly and if Indian authors begin to give full bibliographic details of the editions and studies they use in their publications, the 'neglect' that Dr. Pandurangi feels will progressively decrease. As you can see from the addition I have made above, even the library of a relatively young university such as mine has most of Acharya Parasanath Dwivedi's works. When I joined the University of British Columbia, there was only one book in Devanagari script in the University library system (a reprint of Max Mueller's .Rg-veda edn). Now it has over forty thousand titles.

  

When making the 'neglect' judgement it should also be borne in mind that most Indian Indological publications after independence have suffered greatly because of lack of access to recent Western research (which was, in turn, caused by the shortage or misuse of foreign exchange money). Now the Internet is quickly correcting the situation. However, the habit of not looking into earlier literature before posting in inquiry or investigating a topic or pronouncing a view and of beginning every study with Saaya.na or Max Mueller is still too widespread as can be seen even from \***some\*** exchanges that take place on this list. I very much hope that the next generation of Sanskritists/Indologists will benefit from integrated or connected catalogues of the libraries of universities and research institutions and from mutually complementary acquisition programs directed to foreign publications. There is no reason why at least institutions in the same cities should not cooperate with each other in a better way for the benefit of researchers.

  

Another observation I consider relevant in judging the extent of the validity of the 'neglect' judgment is this: many Indian researchers understand pari.skaara or samanvaya of earlier views as research. A Western researcher typically focuses on historical reconstruction (which may turn out to be right or wrong). Consequently, there is less of an occasion to refer to Indian publications.

  

I hope this discussion does not divert our attention from what I mainly intended to convey, which was:

  

1\. It is important to compile and publishlists of the published and unpublished writings of the scholars who leave our world. Doing so is a very appropriate tribute to the memory of such persons.

  

2. A determined effort should be made to preserve a scholar's/author's unpublished and incomplete but reasonably intelligible writings.

  

3. Institutions of Indological/Oriental research in India should give better publicity to the books and articles they publish.
