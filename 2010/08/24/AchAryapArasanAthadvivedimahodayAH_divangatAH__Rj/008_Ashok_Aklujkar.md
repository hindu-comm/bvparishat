I was not fortunate enough to know Acharya Parasnath Dviwedi. Three thoughts of general importance occur to me as I read about his death.

  

It would be most useful if someone would give us as complete a list of the published (and, if possible, unpublished) writings of the late scholar. Doing so is a very appropriate tribute to the memory of such persons.  

  

In Western institutions of higher learning a determined effort is made to preserve a scholar's/author's unpublished and incomplete but reasonably intelligible writings as a part of a special collection in the institution's library. A note to that effect is made available in the institution's library catalogue.

  

Whenever I visit institutions of Indological/Oriental research in India I find that much more work is published than what I had heard about or found listed in the catalogues of major publishers such as Motilal Banarsidass, Chowkhambha, DK Printworld or Manohar. Why this work never receives wider publicity puzzles me. Surely, it would be in the interests of the institutes to sell the copies they print. Nor would it be much additional work to notify about the institution's own publications through websites, the catalogues of major publishers and discussion lists such as the present one.
