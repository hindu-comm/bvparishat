Why don't you refer to the edition and page and Ch. and verse number so that others also could verify the readings?  
  

Anyhow sheetal is right in that much about the statement that it is found in the exact sequence quoted:

  

*धृतिः क्षमा दमो ऽ*स्तेयं शौचमिन्द्रियनिग्रहः। धीर्विद्या सत्यमक्रोधो दशकं धर्मलक्षणम् ।।" मनुः 6-92.

  

from the webpage. The edition is not given, but it looks fine.

  

With regards
