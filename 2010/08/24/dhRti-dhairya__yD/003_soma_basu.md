Best regards to Dr. Bhat for quoting the verse 6.92 of the Manusmriti.

  

It can be found in page 531 ( volume 1) of the MLBD publication edited by Ganganath Jha (Manusmriti, ed. Ganganath Jha , MLBD, Delhi 1999, 2nd edition).

  

Medhaatithi, the celebrated commentator, says, dhrityaadayo aatmagunaah. tatra dhritir naama dhanaadisamksaye sattvaasrayah...dhiih samyag jnaanam pratipaksa-samsayaadi-niraakaranam, vidyaatmajnaanam. karmaadhyaatma-jnaanabhedena dhiividyayor bhedah...  

  

Steadiness - the feeling of contentment even at the loss of property and such things...Discrimination- true knowledge...Knowledge-of the Soul.  

the difference between discrimination and knowledge is that the former refers to Acts and the latter to the Soul. (vol.5, p. 268).  

  

With best regards,  

  

Soma B
