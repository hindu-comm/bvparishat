Dear Scholars,

I am facing a problem while writing here.Whenever I write to this forum, my name is not mentioned in the caption. Could anyone guide me in this direction? What should I do, so that my name also appears in the caption. Presently, my posts are shown as 'me' in the caption.

With regards ,

Rajkumari Trikha.
