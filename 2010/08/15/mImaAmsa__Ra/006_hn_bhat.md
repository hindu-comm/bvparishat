Dear Iyengar,

  

You could have been clear of this point you wanted to discus. Here is the first question raised from your own message:

  

> नमः सदसे॥  
> 'मीमांस' इति शब्दस्य व्युत्पत्तिं ज्ञातुं इच्छामि  
> विदुषां विधेयः  
> रं ना अयंगार

  

Rest I leave to the scholars to decide upon the meaning of माङ् माने (जुहोत्यादिः) in the context you cited. Anyhow you can depend on the commentators. As pointed out by one of the scholars, the verb is derived from this verb according to Bhamati.

  

But for meaning it is the same as in the Dhatupatha and you may rely on the commentators like Bhattabhaskara or Sayana and compare with the derivation and explanations available in Brahmana-s and Aranyaka-s.

  

Here is one more use of मिमीते in Rgveda 1.65:

  

गायत्रेण प्रति मिमीते अर्कमर्केण साम त्रैष्टुभेन वाकम् । वाकेन वाकं द्विपदा चतुष्पदाक्षरेण मिमते सप्त वाणीः ॥२४॥

  

and the same also in lot in 1.39:

  

मिमीहि श्लोकमास्ये पर्जन्य इव ततनः । गाय गायत्रमुक्थ्यम् ॥१४॥

  

And more you can find in Vedic literature, with the meaning transferred according to the context.

  

With regards


