Dear Samskrit Enthusiast,  
  
namaste. Attached is the Invitation for the Samskrit Week Celebrations in Hyderabad, in Telugu script. For those of you who are not familiar with Telugu script, I have translated the contents into English and attached that file as well. You will notice that our team has designed a nice set of cultural and informational programmes in this connection.  
  
We request you to join in with family and friends on all days of the week. Please share this information with those who might be interested in Samskrit in your neighbourhood or workplace. Where possible, please make effort to display this on notice boards. For details, you can call me on 98661 40406, or Samskrita Bharati office on 040-2475 0111 or 2475 0333. If you are interested in having the hard copy invitation, please write to us along with your complete postal address.  
  
If you are connected with any academic or cultural institution, our Samskrita Saptaha Samchalana Samiti encourages you to celebrate
Samskrit Day on any suitable day during the month of Shravan (August 11th to September 08th). If you need any help in this regard, please do write to us.  
  
Looking forward to your active participation,  
  
bhavadIyaH,
