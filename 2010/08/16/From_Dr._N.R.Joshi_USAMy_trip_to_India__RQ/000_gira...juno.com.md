Respected Scholars, Namaskar! Jai Hind, Jai Bharat!

I returned to USA on July 13 after a long trip of 3 months to India. I had opportunity to meet scholars and exchange views on my favorite research topics, “Mahabharat-History or Myth?” and “Internal Beauty of Sanskrit”. Certain aspects of these topics I discussed on this list in 2009 and in early part of 2010. Bhandadarkar Oriental Research Institute (BORI) published my paper, “Sphota Doctrine in Sanskrit Demystified” in the 2007 Annals of the BORI published in 2008.

I presented power point lecture on “Mahabharat-History or Myth” in one of the colleges run by the society of Dr. Vijaya Bedekar of Thane. He also runs Oriental Institute. I was in contact with him for many years through e-mail. I thank him for giving me opportunity to present my thoughts to the college faculty. I cannot forget the pleasant experience of listening to “Naatya Sangeet” presented by the famous singer Shree Ramdas Kamat on April 11 2010 evening.

My next stop was BORI in Pune. In BORI I had meaningful interaction with Prof. M. G. Dhadphale, Dr. G. U. Thite, and other scholars. Our scholar friend Dr. Pramod Pathak (Ph.D, in Indology) invited us to Goa. He and Dr. Chandralekha, Head of Konkani, Goa University, Goa arranged our lectures in the university. Prof Dhadphale talked on Linguistics while I presented power point slides on my subject, “Internal Beauty of Sanskrit” based on phonemic symbolism. Dr.Vinayakumar who saw my research work completely in the WAVES 2008 conference in USA was also present.

We returned to Pune. Dr Saroja Bhate, the secretary of BORI arranged by lecture in BORI on May 11. About 52 scholars were present. The topic was evidence of Mahabharat from countries outside of the subcontinent. News item appeared next day on my lecture in the Marathi newspaper ‘Lokamata”.  
I took the opportunity to see Dr. S. D. Joshi, the well known Sanskrit scholar while I was in Pune.

My next stop was Hyderabad. Dr. Amba Kulkarni and Dr. Korad Subrahmanyam were kind enough to make arrangement for my lecture at a short notice in their department in University of Hyderabad. First I briefed the scholars on my Mahabharat research. Then power point presentation was shown on “Internal Beauty of Sanskrit”. I am confident about my Mahabharat research. But the origin of Sanskrit is very controversial subject. I had good opportunity to discuss many details of Sanskrit research with the great Sanskrit scholar (we all know him from his postings on bvparshat list) Dr. K. Subrahmanyam. I obtained two books of his, “Theory of Languages” and “Four Vrittis in PaaNini". I am reading them slowly.

On the second day in Hyderabad, Dr. K.V. Krishna Murty of Institute of Scientific Research on Vedas (I-SERVE) invited me to make presentation in his institute on my research on Mahabharat. He generously gave me copies of the research publication books of his institute. At present I am reading and enjoying them. They contain research articles from scholars from different fields of Indian culture and religion.

Next I headed to Tirupati to attend the “All India Oriental Conference” in Rashtriya Sanskrit Vidyapati. This University has impressive buildings. Library is well equipped. The problem many of us faced was the temperature of 45 degree Celsius. Any way on the third day of the conference I presented my paper on “Mahabharat-History or Myth” in history session chaired by Dr. Somashekhar. Many questions were raised after my presentation. But all agreed that I presented new information not heard by them before.

In short, this trip to India was highly productive due to interaction with scholars. The only thing I missed and felt very much is not getting opportunity to meet Dr, Shrinivas Varakhedi. Dr, Gauri Mahulikar invited me to give talk but I did not get time to see her. If Lord Krishna wishes he will bring me back to Bombay and to Hyderabad. And we will meet again.  
Thanks. N.R Joshi.
