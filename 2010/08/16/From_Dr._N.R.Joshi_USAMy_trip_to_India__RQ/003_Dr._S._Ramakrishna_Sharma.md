Thanks to the announcement.  
But no serious and studious review ever appeared here.  
Without complying with the basic criteria of अधिकारी विषय: संबन्ध: प्रयोजनं and  
also without applying the six parameters for arriving at or deriving the essence (...लिङ्गं तात्पर्यनिर्णये) of what avail is such prattling (" IT IS CRITICIZED AS A STORY OF A WAR BETWEEN TWO KINGDOMS.") as that of sheer outsiders to the culture and content of Sri Mahabharatam?
