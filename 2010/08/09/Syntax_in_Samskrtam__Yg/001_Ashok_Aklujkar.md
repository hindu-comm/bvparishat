Publication particulars of what "this article" refers to will be appreciated.

  

The quoted part of the article itself indicates that, in the view of its author, (a) it is a misconception that the Skt grammatical tradition has no discussion of syntax and/or (b) the misconception has later been countered. Does the article go on to make such a statement explicitly?

  

The German scholar Paul Thieme had pointed out long ago that it is erroneous to think of Paa.ninian grammar as not tackling syntax. The essays, summaries and bibliographies in the following three sources establish that the 'lack of study of syntax' view is taken seriously only by scholars who do not take the trouble to do their bibliographic homework:

Hock, Hans Henrich. 1991. (ed) Studies in Sanskrit syntax: a volume in honor of the centennial of Speijer's Sanskrit syntax, 1886-1986.Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass.

Cardona, George. 1976. Panini, a Survey of Research. The Hague-Paris: Mouton. Indian reprint, 1980, 1997. Delhi, etc.: Motilal Banarsidass.

Cardona, George. 1999. Recent Researches in Paninian Studies. Delhi: Motilal Banarssidas.

  

Some articles in the following volume also indirectly touch upon the subject:

Kaul,Mrinal; Aklujkar, Ashok.2008. Linguistic Traditions of Kashmir. New Delhi: D.K. Printworld.

  

Perhaps the following article may also be useful:

Aklujkar, Ashok. 2008. "Traditions of language study in South Asia." In Language in South Asia, pp. 189-220 (= chapter 9). (eds) Kachru, Braj B.; Kachru, Yamuna; Sridhar, S. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.

  

anvaya/samanvaya is a good translation for "syntax" as much as translation of a systemic or technical term in one language is possible in another. Pointing out other meanings of anvaya/samanvaya will not be a proof of inadequacy of the term. It will simply corroborate that words mean what they are said to mean only in certain contexts. It is unrealistic and counter-productive to expect that a word in language L-1 will capture all the meanings or associations of a word in language L-2.

  

Nor is anvaya/samanvaya a new term. When, for example, Malli-naatha writes ihaanvaya-mukhenaiva sarva.m vyaakhyaayate mayaa, it is syntax that is primarily intended (as the order in which he most commonly takes the verse words for comment indicates), although 'consistency with the larger context of a sarga or the entire work' cannot be ruled out as a part of what he intended. Similarly,samanvaya is found used in a period older than that of European influence on India's intellectual traditions; cf.p. 4 of ;Sobhaakara's Ala.mkaara-ratnaakara. The treatise Samanvaya-dik and its commentary Samanvaya-pradiipa-sa.mketa, dealing with what we would call syntax, have been edited as a Ph.D. thesis at the University of Halle by Oliver Hahn.
