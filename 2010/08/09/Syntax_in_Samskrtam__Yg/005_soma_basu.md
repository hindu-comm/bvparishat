thanks for the deliberations on syntax following panini.

  

though not direcly connected,

i would like to know whether Dr. J. S. Spijer mentioned in relation to "Sanskrit Syntax" is the same as Prof. J. S. Speyer who translated Aryasura's Jatakamala published in the Sacred Books of the Buddhist series ?

  

i apologise if i am wrong.
