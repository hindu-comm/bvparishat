They are the same historical person: Jacob Samuel Speijer/Speyer, 1849-1913. The latter is an anglicized spelling. "j" is pronounded like English "y" in German.

By the way, the Ph.D. thesis of Oliver Hahn I mentioned in my last post is published:  
Hahn, Oliver. 2008. Eine altindische Syntaxlehre. Deva;sarmans Samanvayapradipa nebst Autokommentar. Edition, Uebersetzung und Studie. Aachen: Shaker Verlag. \[Series:\] Indologica Halensis.Geisteskultur Indiens, Texte und Studien, Band 12.

This has references to earlier studies and a useful glossary of Skt words bearing on notions in the domain of syntax.
