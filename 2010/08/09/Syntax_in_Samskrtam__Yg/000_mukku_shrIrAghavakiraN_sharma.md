नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

I was reading [this](http://www.hindupedia.com/en/Contents_of_Sanskrit_Grammar) article on Samskrtam Grammar, and I was taken aback on reading the following paragraph:

  

> Kārakaprakaraṇa is the part of grammar that deals with syntax. To be > sure, Sanskrit syntax properly extends beyond the kārakas to include > concordance (agreement of the adjective with the noun and agreement of > the verb with the subject), usage of pronouns and the usage of > numerous participles. Many of these are by convention and usage by > respected authors. This situation led to the comment amongst western > Indologists that if Sanskrit grammar is lacking in any area, it is in > syntax. To quote Dr. H. Kern in his introduction to 'Sanskrit Syntax' > by Dr. J. S. Speijer (published by E. J. Brill, Leyden, 1886), “Indian > grammar, which is virtually the same as saying Pāṇini's grammar, > superior as it is in many respects to anything of the kind produced > among other civilized nations of antiquity, is profoundly deficient in > its treatment of syntax”.

  

Is it really so? My conscience tells on the contrary in this regard. I also feel this could be a serious misconception. Can you please throw light on this?

  

What is syntax \[to be\] termed in*Samskrtam*?
