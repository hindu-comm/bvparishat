pranAma:  
  
I wish to know what are the Pancha Mahaa Kaavyas. I searched in  
internet and found that  
  
1. Kumarasambhavam by Kalidasa  
2. Raghuvamsha by Kalidasa  
3. Kirataarjuniya by Bharavi  
4. Shishupalavadham by Maagha  
5. Naishadhiyacharitam by Sri Harsha!  
  
Is this a correct list. Also I wish to know who named these as Mahaa  
Kavyas.  
  
Thanks,  
Srikanth.
