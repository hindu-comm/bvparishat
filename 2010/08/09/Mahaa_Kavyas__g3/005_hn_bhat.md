Thanks Dr. Sadashva Murti for your effort and time devoted to give a detailed explanation of Mahakavya, to a simple question who named these as Mahakavya-s and why these five are called Mahakavya-s.

  

Yet one more aspect is to be taken into account considering the order of these Mahakavya-s. I heard that these are studied in order by their standard of accessibility to the beginners. In a syllabus of bygone days, The Commentator on Naishadha is given the title of Mahamahopadhyaya. The order of learning the simpler text to complex texts seems to be the cause of the order. (I am not sure of this difference now when I have learnt them through the commentaries, but in the tradition of learning from Guru-mukha it should be considered). It seems to justify the listing of Mahakavya-s in addition to their qualification of being equal to be a Mahakavya.

  

In complexity Bhattikavya or Ravanavadha is left out from the traditional learning. and many other could have been omitted from the syllabus of the time.

  

With regards
