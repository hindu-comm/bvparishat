Regarding the Panchamahakavyas, I remember a Shloka .



द्वे कृती प्रकृतेः पुंसो द्वे चैकमुभयोरपि।



पञ्चस्वेतेषु पाण्डित्यं पुरुषार्थो हि पञ्चमः।।



If I remember correctly, it is written in a manuscript utilized by Dr.Snehalatasharma for her edition ofBhanudatta's Rasamanjari. This verse is not part of the work. Obviously, a scholar hascomposed it while finding the answer of the question why these five Mahakavyas have become important unit and make a group in study circles of Sanskrit. Broadly, his opinion may be summarized in this way:



1\. dve kRutI prakRuteh= Two mahakavyas (Raghuvamsha and Kumarasambhava ) belong to PrakRuti.

2.dve pumsah= Two mahAkAvyas(KirAtArjunIya and ShishupAlavadha) belong toPurusha.

3.ekam cha ubhayorapi.= and, one mahAkAvya(NashadhIyacharita)belong to
both prakRuti and Purusha.



Having scholarship in all these means gaining fifth PurushArtha.



We were repeatedly said by our elders that these Panchamahakavyas make group in Samskrita study circle because study of these give us good command over Sanskrit.



But theauthor of the quoted verse says totally different. I would like to know the opinions of the learned scholars regardingthe strange view of the author.
