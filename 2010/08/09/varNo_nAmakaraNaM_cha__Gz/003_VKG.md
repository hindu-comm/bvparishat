Pranaam!

This is an important aspect raised. Where as Sarma, Varma, Gupta,  
Daasa are the suffixes names of the communities, for easier  
identification and also suggestive in nature.

Some of them have remained in private domain, while the public  
nomenclature for those persons differs.

And, Manu cannot be said to be a Braahmana. If not, the definition of  
Maanava would be impossible and you cannot attribute that word to each  
human being.

When it is said that Brahmana emanated from the Face of Viraat  
Purusha, Kshatriya from the Hands, Vysyas from the thigs and Sudras  
from the Legs: No particular clan/ name is given.

Generally Puraanas explained that Manu was the first procreator on  
this earth in regular Human form.

Hence, he is the moola purusha of the humanity, we have to conclude.

As the base rule of name suffix is suggestive in nature, prefixes such  
as clan name has also been included, apart from community names as  
extra suffixes.

  
More citations from Puraanas are welcome.

Vamshi
