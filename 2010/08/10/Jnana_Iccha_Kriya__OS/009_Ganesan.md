To state further on the three aspects of Sakti:



Basically these three are the different aspects of Siva's Sakti which is unique. It is differently called depending upon its different activities.

Cf. Mrgendragama, (Vidyapada), 13: 166b

कृत्यभेदोपचारेण तद्भेदस्थानभेदजः ।

Also we find in the Ratnatraya of Srikantha: 276

सर्वज्ञानक्रियारूपा शक्तिरेका हि शूलिनः ।

इच्छाज्ञानक्रियाद्या यत्प्रभवाः कार्ययोनयः ।।

Srikumara one of the earliest commentators on the Tattvaprakasa of Bhojadeva states that

पराशक्तिविकारा इच्छाद्याः शक्तयः परमेश्वरस्य करणं हस्तादिस्थानीयम् ।

Siva being inseparable fromHis supreme Saktiand united withHer Kriya aspectHe is the supreme cause of everything, as Srikantha continues in his text:

सेयं क्रियात्मिका शक्तिः शिवस्याव्यभिचारिणी ।

तत्सम्बन्धाच्छिवोऽशेषकार्याणां हेतुरुच्यते ।। Ratnatraya, 278

These three aspects of Sakti are Siva's three eyes: See the poetic description given in the Ratnatraya.

दृक्क्रियेच्छाविशालाक्षो विज्ञानेन्दुकलान्वितः । Ratnatraya, 281a

Though Siva and His Sakti are non-different and exist in an inseparable relation She is sometimes explainedto be different from Him:

अनन्यापि तथा शम्भोर्विभिन्ना शक्तिरिष्यते । Ratnatraya, 303b

अनन्यापि विभिन्नाऽतः शम्भोः सा समवायिनी । Ratnatraya, 304b

Apart from these views there is another veryfundamental point in the Saivasiddhanta: Sakti serves as the 'body' of Siva. In fact as the MrgendragamaVp. 3:8abeautifully describes,

मूलाद्यसम्भवात् शाक्तं वपुः

Narayanakantha comments that the five mantra-s, Sadyojata, Vamadeva, Aghora, Tatpurusha and Isana are in fact His Sakti and serve as His body: शक्तिस्वरूपैः सद्योजातादिभिः पञ्चभिर्मन्त्रैः स्वेच्छानिर्मितं . . . अनुपममभिमतं शरीरम् ।

In the Rauravagama we have other views. There these three aspects are identified with Vama, Jyeshtha, Raudri who are worshippedas part ofvarious rituals.

Srikantha (different from the author of Ratnatraya referred above) in his bhashya on the Brahmasutra-s mentions that the supreme Akasa, which he calls Cidakasa, Cidambara, and which is none other than His Sakti is the body of Siva.

These are a few important points on the concept of Sakti according to Saivasiddhanta which is not shared by the Trika-Pratyabhijna system.



With the best wishes,
