Thank you very much! this is also very helpful!  
  
I read on something that sounds similar- process of ज्ञान- चिकीर्षा- प्रवृत्ति- चेष्टा- कार्य as the process which forms action. (I thought it was similar before, before receiving all your learned answers, but now I am not sure if it is connected to jnana-iccha-kriya)  
I would like to ask the great scholars where can I find more about this process ज्ञान- चिकीर्षा- प्रवृत्ति- चेष्टा- कार्य I am looking specially for original scriptures or traditional commentators.  
Thanking you all,  
Ajay.
