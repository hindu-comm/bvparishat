Sri Ajay Gupta wants to know more about Icchasakti, etc.

I am not sure whether these are the aspects of Vikshepasakti which, if I am right, is an aspect of Maya as conceived by the Advaita Vedanta (probably later than Samkara). Moreover, Maya is illusory and it is not conceived to be a supreme power of non-dual Brahma. For one of the fundamental arguments of Saivasiddhanta against Advaita Vedanta (ref. Samkarabhashya on the Brahmasutra-s, adhyaya 1) is that the supreme reality being Consciousness Absolute (Cit)It cannot have an inert power (acit=jada).

Cf. Mrgendragama, (vidyapada), 3: 4 : करणं च न शक्त्यन्यत् शक्तिर्नाचेतना चितः ।

In the SaivasiddhantaAgama-s the supreme power (Sakti)of Siva is mainly conceived to be of three aspects: Iccha, Jnana and Kriya. In the Mrgendragama (vidyapada) and in its commentary by Narayanakantha as well as in the sub-commentary of Aghorasivacharya we find the explanations of these aspects of Sakti.

I hope I have just answered the query.

With the best wishes,
