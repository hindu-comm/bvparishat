In the Durgaspatasati, Iishadhvaja and Garudadhvaja are mentioned which were in the Himalayas : Perhaps near old Kamboja mentioned in the Nirukta ( mentioned as Kambu) which was an important centre of Indraism, Visnuism and Saivism from which the worship of women (durga) evolved when all the religions were defeated by the Daityas particularly by shumbha and Nishumbha. which are mentioned as Kumbha and Nikumbha in the Nilamata Purana of Kashmir. Kalidasa also mentioned them. Transport of the dhvaja is found in the inscriptions. The Jaina temple in the complex of Mehrauli also exhibits its antiquity of hinduism in this area.
