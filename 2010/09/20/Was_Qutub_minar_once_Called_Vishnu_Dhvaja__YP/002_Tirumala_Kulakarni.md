Respected Sri Sadashivamurty Rani,

  

The mail is very much interesting. How this piece of history is interpreted - is a point of curiosity. After seeing your mail I saw a couple of links in internet. Like -

<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qutb_Minar>. They give the details of its constructions.

  

[](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qutb_Minar)But here is a link -<http://www.hindunet.org/hindu_history/modern/kutub_oak.html>. It quotes P N Oak's sayings -

  

"About the Kutub Minar itself there is overwhelming proof that it was a Hindu tower existing hundreds of years before Kutubuddin and therefore it is wrong to ascribe the tower to Kutubuddin.

  

The township adjoining the Kutub Minar is known as Mehrauli. That is a Sanskrit word Mihira-awali. It signifies the town- ship where the well known astronomer Mihira of Vikramaditya's court lived along with his helpers, mathemati- cians and technicians. They used the so-called Kutub tower as an observation post for astronomical study. Around the tower were pavilions dedicated to the 27 constel- lations of the Hindu Zodiac. .....................

  

The Hindu title of the tower was Vishnu Dhwaj (i.e. Vishnu's standard) alias Vishnu Stambh alias Dhruv Stambh (i.e., a polar pillar) obviously connoting an astronomical observa- tion tower. The Sanskrit inscription in Brahmi script on the non-rusting iron pillar close by proclaims that the lofty standard of Vishnu was raised on the hillock named Vishnupad Giri. That description indicates that a statue of the rec- lining Vishnu initiating the creation was consecrated in the central shrine there which was ravaged by Mohammad Ghori and his henchman Kutubuddin. The pillar was raised at the com- mand is an ancient Hindu king who had made great conquests in the East and the West. ....................."

  

Seeing the both readings one gets the question - whether the views expressed by P N Oak are verified by others?

Seeing the picture attached by you I got a question - according to the studies to which time this script belongs to?

  

Thanks for raising a wonderful issue.
