Viṣṇu-pada-giri- Viṣṇu is one of the three aspects of Brahma indicated  
by 2nd pāda of Gāyatrī-mantra. We cannot see the original creator, but  
can know about sun as it is radiating light (Bhargah). As sun, it is  
holding earth as stated in common mantra of Bhūmi-pūjana-  
पृथिवि त्वया धृता लोका देवि त्वं विष्णुना धृता ।  
In same way Hercules also is stated that he was holding earth-as  
depicted on trade-marks of Hercules cycles. Thus, Hercules means sun  
here. Atlas also is stated that it had lifted earth on its shoulders.  
Mountains have been called Bhūdhara, as they hold the continental  
shelf of earth. Thus, mount Atlas is holding earth on its shoulder.  
In space, 3 steps of Viṣṇu are 3 zones of solar system, starting with  
sun at center. Zone up to 100 sun-diameters is reason of intense heat  
(Tapa).  
शत योजने ह वा एष (आदित्य) इतस्तपति (कौषीतकि ब्राह्मण उपनिषद् ८/३) स एष  
(आदित्यः) एक  
शतविधस्तस्य रश्मयः । शतविधा एष एवैक शततमो य एष तपति (शतपथ ब्राह्मण  
१०/२/४/३)  
Then, up to 1000 diameters (sphere enclosing Saturn orbit) is zone of  
brightness (Sahasrāmśu, sahasrākśa etc).  
युक्ता ह्यस्य (इन्द्रस्य) हरयः शतादशेति । सहस्रं हैत आदित्यस्य रश्मयः  
(इन्द्रः=आदित्यः) जैमिनीय उपनिषद् ब्राह्मण १/४४/५)  
असौ यस्ताम्रो अरुण उत बभ्रुः सुमङ्गलः । ये चैनं रुद्रा अभितो दिक्षु  
श्रिताः सहस्रोऽवैषां हेड ईमहे ॥ (वा.यजु.१६/६)  
Then, light (normal) zone is up to 100,000 diameters (Maitreya  
Maṇḍala).-Vişņu purāņa (2/8) On earth, motion of sun is from Karka-  
rekhā (240 north) to Makara- rekhā (240 south). For north hemisphere,  
equator till 240 north is step 1. 3 steps will reach 720, but before  
that Arctic circle starts at 660. Thus, the third step is on head of  
earth, i.e. on head of its owner king Bali. Viṣṇu was the proper name  
of Vāmana as stated at several places in Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa etc. He  
was not a dwarf man, but small compared to steps of sun which he  
meant. Body of sun is in solar system, sphere of solid planets is  
Dadhi- Vāmana (size of Dadhi Samudra in Bhāgavata purāṇa, skandha 5).  
Within human body, soul (size of atom-10000 parts of hair end in  
Śvetāśvatara upaniṣad (5/9)-  
वालाग्र शत भागस्य शतधा कल्पितस्य च ॥ भागो जीवः स विज्ञेयः स चानन्त्याय  
कल्पते ॥ (श्वेताश्वतर उपनिषद्, ५/९)  
Thus, Viṣṇu-pada on earth is a place at Karka-rekhā. Now, it is at  
23.50 north, in past it was up to about 260 north. Thus, it was  
touching Mithilā in time of king Nimi (son of Ikśvāku) and once  
Naimiśāraṇya, near Lucknow. Motion of sun on earth ends at its Nemi,  
south end is Ariṣṭa-nemi as it is coldest time in north hemisphere.  
Sun is eye, and its ends on earth are its eyebrows (Place of King  
Nimi). In Mahābhārata period, Karka-rekhā was at Gayā, so it was  
called Viṣṇu-pada-Tīrtha and still called, though it is now north of  
it. Gayā or any mountain on Karka-rekhāi is Viṣṇu-pada-Giri.  
In Sūrya-siddhānta an all texts of astronomy, a Śanku (cone) of 12  
angulas is used for measuring its shadow. Whatever may be height of  
Śanku, its 12 part is called 1 angula. That is used for finding north  
south direction, latitude, local time, or declination of sun. Since  
sun is Viṣṇu, it is Viṣṇu-dhvaja. In same sense, it is pillar of  
Hercules. In Śiva purāṇa, his linga also is stated to be of 12 angula-  
in that context it may mean the same.  
Measurement of north-south direction is by shadow end of pole at equal  
intervals of local true noon, say at 11 AM and at 1 PM. The path of  
shadow is in shape of Thistle-kip called Kutupa (Kuppi in Hindi). That  
time also is called Kutupa-muhūrtta (1136 to 1224 hrs) which is  
considered in Śrāddha. That, shadow is bisected by 2 arcs whose common  
point is in shape of Mīna (fish) to find north-south direction. So,  
any device to find north direction is called Kutub-minar. Magnetic  
compass was called Kutub-numa in Arabic.  
Technically, Delhi cannot be called Viṣṇu-pada-Giri as it is about 50  
north of old position of Karka-rekhā. So, it is assumed that Iron  
pillar was originally built at a hill near Ujjain or Gaya and shifted  
there. But it will be far easier to construct it at Delhi itself  
rather than transporting to such distance. Actually, Kutub-minar is  
inclined 50 south and is thus perpendicular on Karka-rekhā. Thus, the  
place can be called Viṣṇu-pada-Giri as artificial construction. It is  
northernmost position of moon in pre-Mahabharata era.  
Megasthenese has stated that Hercules had constructed Palibothri town  
or a pillar there. That pillar of Hercules can mean Kutub-Minar.  
Palibothri was on banks of Yamunā, but without any basis it has been  
equated with Pataliputra (Patna in Bihar). Actually, it was Paribhadra  
which means same as Dehali in sanskrit-boundary wall of a house. It  
was place of army of Kuru kings based at Hastināpuara on banks of  
Ganga. The army itself has been called Prabhadraka-gaṇa under command  
of Dhṛṣṭa-dyumna. Elephant army was at Gajāhvaya (Gaziabad). Persons  
in that army have title of Gajabhiye in Maharashtra. Mahārathis were  
based at Meratha (written as Meerut). Al-biruni has staed Sri Harsha  
Shaka from 456 BC-that might be date of this pillar. Rājatarangiṇī  
also give same time of that king who had installed Mātṛgupta as king  
of Kashmir. Ibn-Batuta has written that Kutub-minar was built 1500  
years before Kutub-ud-Din Aibak (1206-1210). Sir Saiyad Ahmed had  
protested calling Kutub-minar an Islamic structure as it was full of  
Hindu marks. He wrote a 300 page book in 1911 to prove his point.  
It is not a question of Hindu or Islamic marks. 2 aspects of  
technology were impossible in 13th century-(1) Even now it is very  
difficult to build an accurate cone whose axis is inclined 50 south.  
(2) From Mahabharata till 1850, earth had been assumed spherical in  
all calculations. Semi-vertical angle of Kutub minar is equal to  
difference between true and mean latitude of Delhi.  
The description on engraved verse msu be of period of Prithviraj  
Chauhan or earlier-it means that similar script for sanskrit was in  
use at that time-Arun
