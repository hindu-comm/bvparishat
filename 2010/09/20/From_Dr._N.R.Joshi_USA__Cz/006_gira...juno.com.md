Respected scholars, Namaskar!

War of Indra with Namuchi from Rigveda

First I would like to thank all scholars participating in discussions on "Asura" for offering valuable information.

On this list last year and in the early part of this year I discussed the War of Indra with Namuchi. In that war Namuchi had Abalaa senaa (Lady soldiers). Indra easily defeated them and captured two lady soldiers dear to Namuchi. My research shows that Indra's kingdom (if one would like to call Svarga or Suvarga) was north east of Afghanistan. The ancient Ladies kingdom (Mummies are on display in Houston museum at present) was also in the same area. This was confirmed by another Aachaarya on this list by giving other references. The ancient Indians used to be friends of Indra while the ancient Iranians had frequent wars with Indra. Please remember the ancient Iranians are not Asuras. They were related to the ancient Indians. Indra's land was beyond the northern boundary of the ancient Iranian land. It was foreign country to the ancient Iranians. They called it "Paraa-desha" . All this comes in my book on Mahabharat-History or Myth/"

Now Krishna had war with Indra on Pariyaatra mountain. My research shows this mountain is now called Pamirs. If you bring Pariyaatra mountain within India, then you bring Indra within India too and also all Devas and Asuras, Gandharvas, Yakshas etc. Then nothing makes sense.

If we assume Indra, Varun, Mitra, Naasatya were somewhere in the heaven located far away from the earth, then how could we explain war between Indra and Krishna? We have to admit that it happened in the sky or admit that is just a story.

Indians had Apsaras in heaven. Germans called them Valkyries (please pardon me if spelling is not correct).

Duryodhana sat for prayopos'ana after released from the captivity of Gandharva soldiers of Raja Dharmaraja living in Dvaitavana.(No archaeological evidence of Dvaitavana in the subcontinent) . He could not digest insult. Asuras came from the west and gave him support and inflated his ego again. They wanted the destruction of Mahabharat Empire.

18000 mud tablets in one place and 22000 mud tablets in another place were discovered 150 years ago in excavations in the Middle-East. One cannot afford to ignore the connection of the ancient India to the Middle-East. Hindu Puranas and scriptures could be complementary but they are not substitutes for archaeological discoveries. I presented some of this information in my lecture at BORI Pune. Many scholars in the audience said you told us something we never heard before. Please pardon me for long posting. Please correct me if I were wrong so we grow in our knowledge together. Thanks. N.R.Joshi
