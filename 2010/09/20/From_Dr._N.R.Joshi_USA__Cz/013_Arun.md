Dr Rani Sadashiva Murty and Dr R. N Ayengar have given varied examples  
of Devas (Sura) and Asuras from Vedic literature. It has 3 or 5  
meanings as understood in Taittiriya Upanishad, Shiksha valli-  
(1) Adhijyotisha-30 zones of solar system measured in exponential  
scale of Dhama with base 2 are zones of Devas (Rigveda 10/189/3).  
Dhamas are double of previous starting from earth as first  
(Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, 3/3/2)-  
त्रिंशद्धाम वि-राजति वाक् पतङ्गाय धीमहि । प्रति वस्तोरहद्युभिः ॥ (ऋक्,  
१०/१८९/३)  
सदृशीरद्य सदृशीरिदु श्वो दीर्घं सचन्ते वरुणस्य धाम ।  
अनवद्यास्त्रिंशतं योजनान्येकैका क्रतुं परियन्ति सद्यः ॥ (ऋक्, १/१२३/८)  
मा छन्दः तत् पृथिवी, अग्निर्देवता .. (मैत्रायणी संहिता, २/१४/९३, काठक  
संहिता, ३९/३९)  
...द्वात्रिংशतं वै देवरथाह्न्यन्ययं लोकस्तং समन्तं पृथिवी  
द्विस्तावत्पर्येति ताং समन्तं पृथिवीं द्विस्तावत्समुद्रः पर्येति.....  
(बृहदारण्यक उपनिषद् ३/३/२)  
There are 3 Dhamas within earth. For a total of 30+3 dhamas of solar  
system, there are 33 Devas-Prana of each dhama. Their symbols are 33  
letters from K to H. Sanskrit script is a nagar of Devas in symbols,  
so it is called Deva-nagari. Region beyond solar system is dark  
background of galaxy called Apah of Varuna.  
(2) Adhidaivika-Original matter of Universe was Rasa (Taittiriya  
Upanishad 2/7/2). Out of that, only ¼ was used for creation. Remaining  
¾ was unused (Purusha sukta, 3,4). Creative energy/matter is deva.  
Unproductive is Asura-generally dark. Even if it is bright, its level  
is not more than the background. Within solar system, prana of each  
zone is Deva. Obstructions are of 3 types-Vritra=circling or  
delimiting influence zone, Bala (bending) and Namuchi= separating  
surface. Thus, Asuras are 3 times the number of Devas, and creation is  
only from ¼ part.  
(3) Adhibhautika-Devas had 3 lokas o which they gained supremacy in  
time of Vamana= Vishnu (about 15800 BC as per Mahabharata, vana Parva  
23/8-10-Karttikeya calendar, south motion of sun (rains) and year-both  
starting from Dhanishtha). 3 lokas of Indra were roughly Russia, China  
(middle kingdom) and India. Ruler (Agni = Agri) of India was called  
Bharata as he was feeding the world-repeated by all Greek-Roman  
historians about India. China retained the original script of  
Brihaspati-called Shabda-parayana-explanation of each word. Other  
regions adopted grammar of Indra-Marut which broke words in basic  
sounds (Varna and Akshara) and root verbs. It separated (Vyakrita), so  
it was called Vyakarana-(Rk 10/71/1, Taittiriya samhita, 6/4/7,  
Mahabhashya 1/1/1, Maitrayani samhita 4/5/8, Nyaya manjari etc.).  
Till today, there are about 3000 Russian words with same meanings as  
it was in Vedas-listed by late Pt. Chandrashekhar Upadhyay in 1931.  
Vasu has been used for 8 in astronomy-it is used with that meaning  
only in Russian, not in any current Indian language.  
(4) Adhyatmika-Positive tendencies for useful work, improving physical/  
mental ability are Diava and opposite are Asura-summarized in Daiva-  
Asura sampad Vibhaga yoga of Gita, chapter 16.  
(5) Adhi-vidya or Adhiyajna-Yajna is production of useful objects  
(Gita 3/10). It is always done in cycles. The natural time cycles are  
day, month and year-whose measure is called Janya-kala in Surya-  
siddhanta (1/10) as it is measure of production cycle time.  
The civilization, which produced its own needs and never tried to  
capture others was called Devas (see opening comments about India in  
Herodotus, Megasthenes, Solinus, Pliny etc). Persons who captured  
property of others by war, trade practices etc are Asura.  
It is necessary to read original Sanskrit texts also, instead of  
merely copying western manipulations. Indra has always been called  
lord of east and words related to him are still used in eastern part  
of India-from Orissa to Thailand. He has controlled unruly Pak daityas  
in west, so he was given title of ‘Paka-shasana’ by Brahma. The place  
where he showed his power was Shakra (Sakkhara district in Pakistan,  
Hakkara river). There were 14 main Indras listed in Narada purana etc.  
Modern name of Pakistan is just a coincidence. Land adjacent to sea  
was called Pak (Pak strait) and its manager was Reddy. Naval chief  
also was called Suparna-nayaka (Suvanna-naik in Vijayanagara)-  
एकः सुपर्णः स समुद्रमाविवेश स इदं भुवनं वि चष्टे ।  
तं पाकेन मनसापश्यमन्तितस्तं, माता रेऴ्हि स उ रेऴ्हि मातरम् ॥ (ऋग् वेद  
१०/११४/४)  
Archeological evidence is only a corroboration-not a contradiction. If  
somebody really wants to do research, he should be happy that events  
described in Vedas are still seen in India and adjacent lands. He  
should not try to counter them in name of false evidence. Even in  
normal course, a house is broken in 100-200 years. That does not mean  
that it never existed. House of Shankaracharya is not seen now, it is  
sufficient proof that there was no person of his name as the evidence  
of Dvaita-vana has been given. Oxford exercise was solely for  
destruction of Vedic culture and history as clearly declared in the  
aim of Boden Chair in 1831, but loyalists blindly copy them without  
even daring to see any original line of Sanskrit-Arun
