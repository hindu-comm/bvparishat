Respected Scholars, Namaskar!

Dr. Subrahmanyam Korada is invaluable treasure of knowledge. I tremendously benefit reading his postings. I am reading two of his books-Theories of Language and Four Vrittis of PaaniNi. The first book is written in easy to read style. He has brought together and explained with consistency many concepts and definitions used by Sanskrit pundits.

Dr. S. Korada, I never understood exactly what is meant by "Aakritivaada", its source, use or application. I will appreciate if you take time from your busy schedule to explain about it. This request is for other scholars too. Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
