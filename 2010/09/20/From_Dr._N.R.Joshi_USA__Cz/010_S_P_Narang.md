The story of Durga in Durgasaptasati shows that the whole of the episode was  
centered on the defeat of Indra and the location was between Kashmir and Balakh  
: most probably the Afghanistan. It requires further investigation on the basis  
of internal evidence in the light of history of Saivism, Vaisnavism, Indra-ism  
and the Saktism coming stronger. Regards, spnarang
