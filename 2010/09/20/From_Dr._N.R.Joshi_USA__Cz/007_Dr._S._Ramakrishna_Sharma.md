Namaskar,

  
  
\>Dvaitavana.(No archaeological evidence of Dvaitavana in the subcontinent)  
  

"The Mahabharata mentions the Lake Dvaitavana as well as a forest called Dvaitavana  
which spread over the banks of river Sarasvati.(Mbh.III.24-25.)" quoted from page 27.  
The book,*Political History of Ancient India\<From the Accession of Parikshit to the Extinction of the Gupta Dynasty>*  
by Hem Chandra Raychaudhury, Forgotten Books, also refers to The Satapatha Brahmana(XIII.5.4.9) which mentions  
a Matsya king named Dhvasan Dvaitavana who celebrated the horse sacrifice near Sarasvati.  
  
  
Encyclopaedic Dictionary of Vedic Terms, Volume I, by Parameshwaranand(Swami) refers to the same as above  
in the context of the Matsyas.  
  
"The Matsyas in the epic period lived to the west of the Surasenas of Mathura. Earlier, the *Satapatha Br*. refers to a king  
of the Matsyas, named Dhavasan Dvaitavana(XIII.5.4.9), as he ruled the territory near the lake Dvaitavana(*Ibid*."With it (horse-sacrifice),  
indeed, Dvaitavana, the king of the Matsyas sacrificed where this lake is situated".) quoted from the page 398.  
  
Perhaps there seems to be some misreading regarding the name of the king as Dvaitavana! And both the books seem to make the same (mis)reading? With a minor spelling mistake(?)  
  
How to determine the period of Satapatha Brahmana reference and the Mahabharata reference?  
Certainly archeological evidence, if any, will be an eye opener.
