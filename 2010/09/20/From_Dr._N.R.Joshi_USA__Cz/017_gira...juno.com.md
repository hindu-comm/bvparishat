Respected Scholars, Namakar!

I am thankful to Dr. S. Korada for replying in detail to my question on Aakriti vaada. It will take one month for me to digest it.

I would like to know the Vyutpatti of Sanskrit word "Shabda" . I know this word is used with many meanings as discussed by Dr. S. Korada in his book, "Theories of Language". Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
