Dear Sir,

  

Thanks for the historical information on the word Asura. On my side I may add to the lexical ambiguity of the word, that the word was derived according to Nirukta school only as AsUn raati, or asyati ripUn = meaning who provides strength or expelling enemies as adjective to the devata-s described in the respective hymns. And not to name an instance, I am afraid, I haven't verified all the occurrences of the word (throughout) as substantive noun meaning demons. Or it might be use in the opposite direction meaning Deva-s.

  

If this be true, it was used in the sense of demons, the counter-parts of Sura-s, by the time of Mahabharata. Lexicographers since Amara, have listed the word among the synonyms for the demons.  

  

Thanks for all who contributed to the topic.

  

With regards
