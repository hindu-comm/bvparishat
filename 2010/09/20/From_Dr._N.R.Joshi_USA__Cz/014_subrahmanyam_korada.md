Namo vidvadbhyah

The question of **AkrtivAda** has to be discussed taking **NyAya, Vaisesika, MImAmsA , VyAkarana , Bauddha**, **Jaina, Nirukta and VedAnta** . The order of Darsanas is important .

**AkrtivAdah (MImAmsA only**) means – only akrti , i.e. jAti , is
expressed as **vAcyArtha** by a Sabda thru **AbhidhA** , **not vyakti** .

Due to **SamavAya / nAntarIyakatva** vyakti is later denoted but thru **LaksanA . Abhidha** , having denoted the

**Visesana (jAti)** becomes feeble and cannot reach **visesyam(vyakti**) .

**Derivation - Akriyate vyaktih anayA iti Akrtih , PramAnam** ?

‘JAtimevAkrtim prAhuh vyaktirAkriyate yayA I sAmAnyam tacca pindAnAm ekabuddhinibandhanam II’ – KumArila in AkrtivAda , SlokavArtikam(3) , **Akriyate = nirUpyate** . So **Akrti , JAti , SAmAnyam are synonyms** .

**Problem** : gauh na hantavyA – here gauh means ‘ the gamut of cows on earth’ , i.e. jAti .GAmAnaya – here gAm means a cow individual , i.e. vyakti .

**  
**

**Origin and development** :

**NyAya** - **-**

**‘jAtyakrtivyaktayastu padArthah’** (nyAyasU. 2-2-67) – is the AksapAdasUtram which says that all the three , i.e**. jAti, Akrti and vyakti are combinely** to be taken as the meaning of a Sabda . Just like – **sahasram gAvah, gargAh satam dandyantAm, ‘iti hetuh** **tadudbhave**’, due to ‘**SabdasaktisvabhAva’ (Panktirvimsati .. PAnini** 5-1-59) it is **‘samudAyaparisamApti’** .

**‘VyaktirgunavisesAsrayo mUrtih’**(nyA 2-2-68) – mUrtih = **mUrchanti avayavA atreti** mUrtam dravyam, na tu sarvam . **Vyajyate it vyaktih** .

**‘Akrtih jAtilingAkhyA’**(nyA 2-2-69) – niyatAvayavasamyogah Akrtih . JAti and jAtilingam.

**‘Mrt, suvarnam, rajatam’** etc. – in such cases jAti is not ‘**AkrtivyangyA**’ , i.e. these words express **jAti and vyakti but not Akrti** .

**NyAyavArtikam** – Akrtau niyamo na jAtau, sarvAkrtirjAtilingamiti, na punah sarvA Akrtih jAtyA lingyate .

**TAtparyatIkA** – sironAsikAlalAtacibukadInAm siro’vayavAnAm vyUhA manusyatvajAtilingam sira Acaste . na punah sarvA jAtih AkrtyA lingyate iti , mrtsuarnarajatAdikA hi rUpavisesavyangyA jAtih, na AkrtivyangyA, brAhmanAdijAtistu yonivyangyA, AjyatailAdInAm jAtistu gandhena vA rasena vA vyajyate .

**‘SamAnaprasavAtmikA jAtih’**(nyA 2-2-70) – the cause of jnAna such as ‘idamapi dravyam, idamapi dravyam’ etc in different vyaktis it is called ‘sAmAnyam’ , dravyatvAdi , the same is called ‘parA jAtih’ (**VArtikam says that this SUtram is not perfect** , there will be problem in
places like ‘pAcaka’, where there is **pAcakatvajnAnam without jAti**)

**‘Gotvam** ‘ generates **‘abheda’** among govyaktis but causes ‘bheda’ from ‘asva’ etc , so gotvAdikam is ‘sAmAnyavisesa, and the same is called ‘aparA jAtih’

**‘SAmAnyam dvividham proktam param cAparameva ca ‘ (BhAsAparicchedah-8).**

**The first SUtra is commented by VAtsyAyan**a - yadA bhedavivaksA visesagatisca tadA vyaktih pradhAnam, angam tu jAtyAkrtI, yadA bhedah avivaksitah sAmAnyagatisca tadA jAtih pradhAnam angam tu jAtyAkrtI, tadetat bahulam prayogesu .

In the sentence – **gauh na hantavyA, ‘gauh’ – means gotvajAti** ,i.e. any cow (all cows)on earth.

In the sentence – ‘**gAmAnaya’, ‘gauh’ means govyakti**, i.e. a cow individual .

For Akrti, ‘**pistakamayI gauh’** is offered as an example (**PrasannapadA on NyAyabhAsyam**)

Finally , the **‘form’ (avayavasamsthAnam**) is meant by the term **‘Akrti’** .

****

**Vaisesika –**

**In ‘Uddesaprakarana’ of PrasastapAdabhAsyam**, the author says – anuvrttipratyayakAranam sAmAnyam , tatra param sattA , mahAvisayatvAt, dravyAdyaparam alpavisayatvAt , tacca vyAvrtterapi hetutvAt sAmAnyam sadvisesAkhyamapi bhavati (see NyAyakandalI of Sreedharabhatta also) .

Generally when we say jAti it is gotvAdi and it is inseparable from vyakti due to **SamavAyasambandha (ayutasiddhayoh sambandhah**).

**Nityam ekam anekAnugatam sAmAnyam** – is the definition offered by **NaiyAyikas** and the same is generally acceptable .

In other words, it is **‘avaccedakatvam’** , i.e. **anyUnAnatiriktavrttidharmah** -

The term **‘avaccheda’** – is used in the sense of ‘**niscaya’** (samyogo viprayogasca…**sabdArthasyAnavacchede** visesasmrtihetavah – VakyapadIyam –Vakya) .

The gotvam , i.e. jAti , separates a ‘gauh’ from the rest of the things in the universe and due to gotvam only it is decided that it is a gauh .

**GotvAvacchinnah gauh** . The meaning of ‘**tva’ and ‘tal’** will be discussed under **VyAkaranam** .

Thus as the time passed there remained only two things – **jAti and vyakti** .

Although the term ‘Akrti’ is used, it lost its original sense and became a synonym of jAti .

In other words ‘**AkrtivAda’ is nothing but ‘jAtivAda’** .

**MImAmsA –**

**‘Akrtistu kriyArthatvAt’** (JaiminisU 1-3-33) – is the JaiminisUtram that is the SiddhAnta - since acquiring a ‘sthandila’that resembles a ‘syenAkrti’- is the purpose of ‘cayanakriyA’ , jAti only is the meaning of a padam –

Akrti only is sabdArtha but not vyakti . In case vyakti is the sabdArtha then the sentence – syenacitam cinvIta – does not have any meaning as it is not possible to aquire / generate a syenavyakti thru cayanakriyA . So the sentence becomes null and void .

Here the karanavyutpatti , i.e. syenaiscIyate iti syenacit , is not proper , rather it should be ‘cayanena syenam cinotIti syenacit’ following **PAnini** – 3-2-92 , **karmanyagnyAkhyAyAm**.

The **SAbdabodha** is – istakAbhih cIyamAnam syenasadrsam cayanena sampAdayet , and this is possible only if the meaning of syenapada is Akrti .

You may argue that – Akrti is visesanam and vyakti is visesyam and as such they are two different ‘padArthas’ (meanings of padas) . The padam which denotes ‘Akrti’ does not denote ‘vyakti’ and the one which denotes ‘vyakti does not denote ‘Akrti’ . Therefore , it can be decided that following the **‘prakaranam’**(context) eitheris ‘**pradhAnam**’ and the other is ‘**guna**’ ---- this does not hold water –

(**refutation of AksapAda and Patanjali**) GunapradhAnabhAva is possible iff (if and only if)

both jAti and vyakti are denoted by the same word simultaneously – if Akrti is denoted vyakti is not denoted and vice versa . Akrti is nityasambaddha with vyakti and as soon as the Akrti is known the vyakti is also known (**AkrtivAda means Akrti is vAcyArtha and vyakti is laksyArtha).**

By and large , it is immaterial for us as to whether **GunapradhAnabhAva** is there or not and it does not in any way affect our argument – a thing which is gunabhUta is not denoted by **MukhyavyApAra**, i.e**. AbhidhA** and there will be **GaunavyApAra**
in such cases .

**‘TadarthatvAt prayogasyAvibhAgah’** (JaiminisU 1-3-35) – since words like ‘vrIhIn’ etc. denote vrIhivyaktis there will not be any problem in cases like ‘ vrIhIn proksati’, [i.e.as](http://i.e.as) vrIhijAti has got connection with vrIhivyaktis , the latter is denoted thru **LaksanA** .

In other words, although the **jAti, which is visesana**, is known in the first place, since it cannot sustain the isolation, **denotes vyakti, the visesya, thru LaksanA**.

Therefore, **Akrti(jAti) is the meaning of gauh , asvah etc**. Here is **KumArila** **(TantravArtikam**) –

**visesyam nAbhidhA gacchet ksInasaktirvisesane** I

AnantyavyabhicArAbhyAm saktyanekatvadosatah I

na vyaktAvAkrtau tu syAt sarvametatsamanjasam II

anvayavyatirekAbhyAm ekarUpapratItitah I

**VyAkaranam – **

**PAnini** takes up both – here is MahAbhAsyam (PaspasA) –**kim punarAkrtih padArthah** **Ahosvit dravyam** **? ubhayamityAha** , katham jnayate ? ubhayathA hyAcAryena sUtrAni pathitAni I Akrtim padArtham matvA ‘**jAtyAkhyAyamekasmain** **bahuvacanamanyatarasyAm**’ (1-2-58) ityucyate I dravyam padArtham matvA ‘**sarUpAnAmekasesa ekavibhaktau’**(1-2-64) ityekasesa Arabhyate I

At the outset of **MahAbhAsya Patanjali** , under ‘**atha gaurityatra kassabdah’** says –

Yattarhi bhinnesvabhinnam chinnesvacchinnam sAmAnyabhUtam sa sabdah? netyAha, AkrtirnAma sA . This is the siddhAnta and here **sAmAnyam / Aakrti (jAti) means** **DNA(nucleic acid) . **

The above definition offered by Patanjali is on a par with **‘natyamekamanekAnugatam’** .

Here **NAgesa** comments – Akrtih jAtih samsthAnam ca , Akriyate vyavacchidyate anena svAsrayo’nena iti vyutpattyA iti bhAvah . ‘JAtyAkrtivyaktayastu padArthah ‘ iti gautamasUtrena tasyApi padArthatvabodhanat , pratyaksAdau tadbhAnAcca .

Under ‘siddhe sabdArthasambandhe’ Patanjali says – AkrtiranyA cAnyA ca bhavati

Dravyam punastadeva’ .

**Kaiyata** – asatyopAdhyavacchinnam brahmatattvam dravyasabdavAcyamityarthah . **Brahmadarsane** **ca gotvAdijAterapi asatyatvAt anityatvam**

**‘Atmaivedam sarvam’** iti srutivacanAt .

**NAgesa** - anityeti , sa ca kambugrIvAdirUpah , tadvyangyajAtirUpasca, jAterapIti

anena etatprakaranasthAkrtipadasya vyangyavyanjakobhayaparatAm sUcayati , gautamenApyuktam ‘ jAtyAkrti…’

**MahAbhAsyam** – nityA Akrtih , katham? Na kvciduparateti krtvA sarvatroparatA

Bhavati , dravyAntarasthA tUpalabhyate .

**Kaiyata** – advaitena loke vyavahArAbhAvAt - vyavahAre ca
AkrterekAkAraparAmarsahetutvAt nityatvam.

**NAgesa** – **Akrtipadena jAtirityabhiprAyena** .

Under ‘**jAterastrIvisayAdayopadhAt**’(4-1-63) Patanjali quotes two verses – **jAtirityucyate , kA jAtirnAma ?**

AkrtigrahanA jAtih lingAnAm ca na sarvabhAk I

sakrdAkhyAtanirgrAhyA gotram ca caranaissaha II

prAdurbhAvavinAsAbhyAm sattvasya yugapadgunaih I

asarvalingAm bahvarthAm tAm jAtim kavayo viduh II

But since neither verse is commented by **BhAsykAra** these are **not the SiddhAnta** – says NAgesa .



Among **VaiyAkaranas** also there was difference of opinion about jAti and vyakti –

Under ‘**sarUpAnAm ekasesa ekavibhaktau’**(1-2-64) Patanjali records –

**‘AkrtyabhidhAnAdvA ekam vibhaktau vAjapyAyanah , dravyAbhidhAnam vyAdih’**

In this context , a couple of Vedic sentences are taken up and
discussed as in **MImAmsA.**

**Patanjali concludes – nahyAkrtipadArthakasya dravyam na padArthah , dravyapadArtha-**

**Kasya vA Akrtirna padArthah , ubhayorubhayam padArthah , kasyacitkimcit pradhAnabhUtam kimcitgunabhUtam , AkrtipadArthakasya
Akritih pradhAnabhUtA Dravyam gunabhUtam , dravyapadArthakasya
dravyam pradhAnabhUtam AkrtirgunabhUtA** .

The term **‘jAti’** denotes ‘**jAti’** as there is another ‘**jAti**’ in that word . The terms – **jAti** and **sAmAnyam** denote the meaning
‘jAti’ as ‘**jAti’ is pravrttinimittam** .

**Vaisesikas** argue **- nissAmAnyAni sAmAnyAni** (there cannot be **‘jAti’ in ‘jAti’** ).

But according to them also it is required – asserts Hari (VAkyapadIyam 3-1-11,12,14) –

arthajAtyabhidhAne’pi sarve jAtyabhidhAyinah I

vyApAralaksanA yasmAt padArthAh samavasthitAh II

jAtau padarthe jAtirvA viseso vApi jAtivat I

sabdairapeksyate yasmAt tataste jAtivAcinah II

anupravrttidharmo vA jAtissyAtsarvajAtisu I

vyAvrttidharmasAmAnyam visese jAtirisyate II

According to **VaiyAkarana**s there can be **jAti** in **Guna, KriyA and SamjnA** also as there is - niyatarUpena ekAkArArthabodhakatvam .

Among the **four AbhAvas** there is **no jAti** , had there been one they would have become **‘bhAvapadArthas’** . Rather , since there is a common dharma in the form of **‘abhavanAtmaka’** , that itself is the **jAti** .

**Bauddha and Jaina** -

According to **VijnAnavAdins (Bauddhas and Jainas**) also Akrti or jAti is sabdavAcya as everything is in the form of **‘VijnAna’**, i.e. it is buddhi only. Due to **AvidyA** it appears

as a thing in the outside world . If it shines in different forms in the **Buddh**i then it becomes ‘**dravya**’ (VAkya . 3-1-19) –

anupravrttirUpAm yAm prakhyAtAm Akrtim viduh I

kecidvyAvrttirUpAm tu dravyattvena pracaksate II

**Niruktam** -

All the **Kriyas** (**sadbhAvavikAras**)are the forms of **MahAsattA** only and it is acceptable to **Yaska** too –

saiva **bhAvavikAresu sadavasthAh prapadyate** I

kramena saktibhih svAbhirevam pratyavabhAsate II

If all the **UpAdhi**s are the forms of **Parabrahman** then why there are **jAti and vyakti** ?

(Vakya 3-1-32)

satyAsatyau tu yau bhAgau pratibhAvam vyavasthitau I

**satyam yattatra sA jAtih asatyA vyaktayah smrtAh** II

**Hari** explains that the **MahAsattA** is nothing but **Brahman** and the same exhibits itself

thru **Vivarta** in the form of **gotva, ghatatva, patatva** etc. and all the sabdas are there in

jAti (VAkya 3-1-33) –

sambandhibhedAt sattaiva bhidyamAnA gavAdisu I

jAtirityucyate **tasyAm sarve sabdA vyavasthitAh** II

**NaiyAyikas** may call it **NityA** **, SAmkhyas MahAn , VedAntins AtmA and PAnini** **PrAtipadikArtha and DhAtvartha** . It is expressed thru **tva, tal, khal, ghan** etc in

**BhAva - tasya bhAvastvatalau (Pan5-1-119), bhAve (Pan3-3-18), i.e. Taddhita or Krt**. **BhAva** is the **Pravrttinimitta** and the same is **SattA** (ibid 34)–

tAm prAtipadikArtham ca dhAtvartham ca pracaksate I

sA nityA sA mahAn AtmA **tAmAhuh tvatalAdayah** II

**  
**

**VedAnta** –

‘**apAgAdagneragnitvam** vAcArambhanam vikAro nAmadheyam ..’(**ChAndogyopa** . 6-4-1) – Agnitvam divorced Agni , i.e. **jAti is not nitya** .

Following ‘**sarvam khalvidam brahma’ , ‘Atmaivedam sarvam’** etc. VedAntins do not accept anything except **Brahman** . So there is nothing like jAti for VedAntins .
