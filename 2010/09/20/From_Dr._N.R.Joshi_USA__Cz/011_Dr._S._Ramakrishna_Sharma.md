\>The story of Durga in Durgasaptasati  

अभिवन्द्य,  
"नदीपुळिनमाश्रित:" the river bank on which Suaratha Maharaja and the Vaishya  
did penance, having cast an Idol of Devi using sand and clay,(both these, viz.  
the location and Idol are located according to the Stala-Puranam of Polali Temple,  
near Mangalore on the banks of the sacred river mentioned in Sri Saptashati.)
