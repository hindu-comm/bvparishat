Respected Scholars, Namaskar!

Vyutpatti of the word “Asura”

I do not remember why the member asked the etymology of the word “Asura”. Now we got the etymology from two Sanskrit scholars. Asuras were present at the time of Mahabharat and even before that. Krishna killed Narakasura. Bheema killed Hidimbasura and Bakaasura. Mother of Ghatotkaca was Hidimbaa. The question is whether these asuras were within the Indian subcontinent or outside assuming that they were people like any other people of the ancient world.

It was written on this list (Dr.Arun Sept7, 2010) that the ancient country Assyria from the Middle-East was called Asura in Puranas. My research shows Asuras mentioned in Puranas had no connection with Assyria. This is simply based on phonetic similitude. The history of Assyria was well researched. It was also written by Dr. Arun that Nineve was destroyed by the king of Medes which was east of Indus. It is true that Nineve was destroyed by Medes but they were never in the known history and in the ancient history east of Indus (within the borders of the subcontinent).

Cyrus the Great (Cyrus II) established the Persian Empire in 546 BC. This empire was known as the Medo-Persian Empire. Medes was the satrapi no one of the empire. Medes were located from the beginning in the western Iran, roughly over the area now called Kurdistan. Medes were the strongest people of the Persian Empire. The name Abhyavarti Chayaman was associated with the ancient history of Vaikarta province (Hyrkania-modern name) of the eastern Iran. Persian Empire spread from Egypt to lower Sindhu River in the known history (546 BC to 326 BC) until it was destroyed by Alexander. The Persian king Daurius III fighting with Alexander sent message to Indians in Gandhar to come to his help with elephants. Indians did not go and just waited until Alexander reached at the doorstep of Gandhar. There is no record of any Indian king extending himself beyond Gandhar to the west before 326 BC. Candragupta went to Afghanistan after 326 BC. This is the only one example.

There is no point calling people outside of the subcontinent Mlenccha or Vris’la. They had empires in the known history. On the other hand India kept losing her land all the time to the outsiders after Candragupta. So there is no point in boasting that kings from Puranas conquered the whole world.

On the other hand my research has established that certain personalities and events from Mahabharat had connections to outside of the subcontinent. Example: Bheema killed Kirmir rakshasa, His descendants moving towards west were known by the name Cimmerians. These were giants.They reached Ukraine. One can get this information from the ancient history (Cimmerians-Sarmatians Era of Ukraine). These Sarmatians were related to Amazons (Ladies kingdom) described in Mahabharat. If one trusts Puranas, then one has to co-relate the information to the history of the outside world. If I were wrong, please give us new information you have so we can grow in knowledge together. Thanks. N. R. Joshi.
