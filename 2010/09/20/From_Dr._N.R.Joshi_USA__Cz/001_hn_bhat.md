Dear Joshi,

  

You should be right, if I remember a saying by my elder friend who was working in a Court of Law, that one cannot be at a time be a judge, lawyer and evidence for any issue in question. Even one can defend himself, as a testimony his own statements cannot be taken into account and never he himself can act as the judge also on the issue when it is in arbitration.

  

Please correct me if I am wrong or mislead in this assumption.

  

With regards
