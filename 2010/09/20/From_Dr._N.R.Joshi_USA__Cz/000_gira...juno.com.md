Respected Scholars, Namaskar!

I went beyond Puraanas

Dr. R. N. Iyengar, "I am not suggesting that there may be nothing, but no serious effort has been made by  
traditional Sanskrit scholars about investigating ‘historical/ cultural’ links other than stating what is said in the Puranas."  
I have made such efforts to find evidence of Mahabharat from countries outside of the subcontinent using the available archaeological information from those countries. I am not involved in fixing the date of the war from epic. I repeatedly asked question to Indian scholars, "Who were in the countries outside of the subcontinent when the epic was fought.?" I discussed this matter on this list in 2009. If daitys, danavas, asuras, gandharvas, devas, apsaras, kinneras were all within the subcontinent in the ancient time, then who were living in the world? To the best of my knowledge I never received satisfactory answer. So I researched the ancient history of those countries. I showed my power point presentation in USA as well as in India. My opinion-Indian people are very much fixed on certain ideas like Kaliyuga. It might be true. However one should try to collect information from the world outside of India. It helps in understanding of the ancient Indian history. Scriptures are no substitute for research.

Using my knowledge of physical properties of articulated sounds, I published the paper on mystic sphota that pops up several time in Sanskrit semantics. The title of the paper is , "Sphota doctrine in Sanskrit semantics is demystified." It is published in the Annals (2008) of Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, Pune. Thanks. N.R.Joshi
