Dear Scholars  
Namo Namah  
  
As we know or claim that the Vedas are treasure of information science  
and knowledge. So I want to know the real interpretation of the term  
ShIrsA in relation to PuruSha. Sahasra SIrsha purusah etc. What is the  
meaning of thousands ShIrsA in the context of modern science?  
Thanks Ramanath
