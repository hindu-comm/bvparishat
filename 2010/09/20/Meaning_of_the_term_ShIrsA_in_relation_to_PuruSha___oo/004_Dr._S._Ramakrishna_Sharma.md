Respected Scholars,  
  
As rightly stated by Sri Arun Ji elsewhere(posted in another Google Group)  
"harmony is the secret of memory", meaning (in that context), comprehensive,  
insightful and cohesive perception. Indeed, a harmonious mind can also discern  
the concord across the scriptural/Vedic statements, phrases and terms.

  
  
\>I think that Purusha is mind and SIrsha is brain because brain  

has attached with thousands nervous system.  
  
In the context of micro-cosmic description, yes, it is brain(SIrsha).  
And in that case, Purusha can be taken as mind; though Taittireeya Upanishat  
wants us to understand more about Purusha. It is anna-rasa-maya:.  
There the mantra mentions that the physical living body has an antara-atma,  
which is praana-maya etc leading to the five "koshas" concept.  
  
(We have to search for parallel findings, if any, in modern medical science  
regarding the Pancha-Koshas.)  
  
In the context of the macro-cosmic meaning, "brain" would be too naive.  
And the Purusha of the Sukta primarily is macro-cosmic.  
  
There must be concord of meanings in both cases, that is vyashti and samashti.  
yadiha tad amutra!  
As above, so is below.
