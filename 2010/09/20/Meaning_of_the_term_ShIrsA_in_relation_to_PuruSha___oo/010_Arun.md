Sahasra=which moves or lives together. Generally, we know about a 1000  
persons, or live with thousands persons in a village, or a sector of  
town. So, Sahasra = 1000. Our influence or effect is felt by 1000  
persons. It has become hasra =effect in Persian and Hazar=1000 in  
Hindi etc. In Pusrusha-sukta, Sahasra means 1000 and infinity both as  
per the context. Sahsra-vartma hi Samavedah-i.e. influence is upto  
1000 units. Gravitational effect of earth is felt upto 1000 times its  
radius-That is varaha-zone from whose matter earth was created. In  
exponential scale with base 2, it measures 10, i.e. 13 ahar-ganas. So,  
actual branches of Sama in word form are 13 only as per Sama-tarpana  
vidhi.  
Zones of Sun are named as heat (100 diameters of sun), Brightness  
(1000 diameters) and Light (1 lakh diameter). These are Pada, Aksha  
and Shirsha zones. Actual body extends 10 times more-Purusha is 10  
times Bhumi. Thus Pada or heat zone is upto 1000D, Brightness from 100  
to 10,000 and Light from 10,000 to 1 crore Diameters.  
Number of branches of Universe are 10 billion galaxies and our galaxy  
has same number of stars. That is same as number of nurons in our  
mind. Thus, man is image of universe as in Shatapatha Brahmana  
(12/3/2/5 and 10/4/4/2). 10 billion is quite a big number to be called  
infinity.  
Reverse tree of Gita (15/1) is chain of creation of 5 stages of  
universe. It also means chain of desire-plan-action-result-  
consumption. Then fresh desires arise-this is explained in next verses  
of Gita. These chains are infinite. Possibility of thought, modes of  
action, uncertainty in results are all ininite.  
Within mind also, there is a sahasrara-chakra at crown of head. That,  
supposes 20 times the nervous capacity from Ajna-chakra downwards-  
indicated by 50 letters. But fluctuations of mind are infinite  
expresses as 3 steps of Vak-Para, Pashyanti, madhyama. These  
fluctuations are called Chitta-vrtti in yoga-sutras. Smallest  
conceivable fluctuation may be called Paramanu of Mana in Vaisheshika  
darshana. Chitta has 3 parts-mana (random fluctuations), buddhi  
(logical chain) ahankara (consciousness of a single system or  
individual). They merge into Atma-which is same as Paramatma on grand  
scale. These are Purusha.  
Perceivable aspect of Pusrusha is with short vowel-that is 1 pada  
only. If we include 3 unseen Amrita-padas in space, it is Poorusha-as  
seen from context of Purusha-sukta. In Gita also, this word with long  
vowel has been used in 3/19 and 3/36-it includes seen and unseen parts  
of Purusha including results of action.  
Various meanings can be understood as per context. I have given  
examples of cosmic, physcal and internal meanings as per my limited  
knowledge-Arun
