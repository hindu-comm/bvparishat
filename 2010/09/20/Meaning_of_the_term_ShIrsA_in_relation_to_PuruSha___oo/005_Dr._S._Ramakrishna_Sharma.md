For the kind attention of Esteemed Scholars,  
  
*The System of Nuclear Growth and Life From Dark Matter As In Rg-Veda*  
is a book published by:  
Dr.Khem Chand Sharma  
203,Shalimar Bagh,  
New Delhi 110 088  
Tel. 91 11 27484579  
e-mail [mdshar...@rediffmail.com]()  
Having read his paper on *Knowledge Beyond The Quarks As The Fundamental  
Particles of Matter As In The Rg-Veda*, I rang him to discuss on certain aspects.  
Then he mentioned that he has published a book. However, I did not get the title  
from him, nor info about the publishers.  
In his paper(published in Vijnana Bharati, Conference proceedings on Vdic Sciences, 2005/?)  
he has mentioned the title mentioned above.  
He will be presenting a paper on related topic during the Conference on Decoding Veda Vidya  
in January, 2011.  
  
धन्यो' स्मि।
