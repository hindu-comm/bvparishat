Dear Sir,  
  
Thank you for your thought provoking comments!  
  
I personally agree with you on your views. But, unfortunately, most of the gurus with whom we studied or studying are incidentally 'salaried species', due to University/college framework and we should limit this context to colleges/Universities - but not extend it to 'Knowledge Industry (that includes such as 'management gurus')'.  
  
As our gurus are just fall in the salaried class, not all of them are devoid of 'gurutva'. Individual opinions may differ on Teachers Day vs Guru Poornima. I strongly believe, there is a clear conventional distinction while looking at the definition of each term given by you. Ex:  
  
उपनीय तु यश्शिष्यं वेदमध्यापये द्द्विजः ।  
सकल्पं सरहस्यं च त**माचार्यं** प्रचक्षते ।।  
  
एकदेशं तु वेदस्य वेदाङ्गान्यपि वा पुनः ।  
योऽध्यापयति वृत्त्यर्थं **उपाध्याय** स्स उच्यते ।। (म.स्मृ. २.१४०-१४१) and  
  
the supremacy of Acharya over Upadhyaya while establishing ultimate reverence to mother -  
  
उपाध्यायान् दशाचार्यः आचार्याणां शतं पिता ।  
शतं च पितृन्माता गौरवेणातिरिच्यते ।। (म.स्मृ. १४५)  
  
Hence, there is a subtle, strong difference between the usage of these synonymous words contextually. But, we need to introspect that how many such words are applicable in today's academics. Starting from sage Vyasa to our present guru lineage, we pray during guru poornima (..अस्मदाचार्यपर्यन्ताम्...).  
  
I can correct myself, if there are any conceptual problems.  
Scholars are प्रमाणम् for any elucidations over this topic.  
  
Regards,  
Prasad
