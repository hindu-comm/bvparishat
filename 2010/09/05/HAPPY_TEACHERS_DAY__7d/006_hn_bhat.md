Thanks for Dr. Sadashiva Murty and JR Prasad's scholastic and thought provoking lead of the process of thought of considering Teaching as a Professional Skill like other professions as a whole.

  

There is a saying somewhere in literature that नैषा शास्त्रगर्हा, अपि तु पुरुषगर्हैषा। the source of which I do not remember or could find on the net. Even though the majority in Teaching profession may not be loyal to their profession, but there can be many more loyal and committed to their profession as in other fields. A strict survey may not be possible, but that doesn't disqualify the species as a whole for the respect they reserve. This is my personal opinion.

  

And one more note that Like the Gurupurnima is dedicated to commemorate the birth of Vyasa, the greatest of great Guru-s, (who might have been born on that day according to our belief, as we know it is the traditional belief. No man could verify his date of birth, than the belief), this Teachers' Day is celebrated commemorate the Great Teacher of our time (according to me at least, even if others may disagree) Dr. S Radhakrishan, through whose book "Indian Philosophy" only I came to realize the extension and dimensions of Indian.  Philosophical thoughts and we conveniently used this day to pay homage to this Great Teacher of our time nd conveniently used by the members of this forum to pay homage to all our Teachers (whether Guru, Acharya, Adhyapaka, or call him by any name like Bee, turtle (according to Bhagavata there are 25 such teachers of good things if you want to observe and learn). If we can utilized so called GurupurNima of the sage (of uncertain birth) why can't we utilize this Birth Day of a person our time to honour all the teachers and teaching profession?

  

Now coming to the quotation from Manu provided by JR Sharma, it is very clear that "Vritti" doesn't disqualify the profession at all. Even the Great Teacher Yajnavalkya was certain about his knowledge, and ordered the remuneration of 1000 cows to be taken to his Gurukula first (not for himself, but for maintenance of his Gurukula) and taught Janaka Atmavidya after they had taken the remuneration.

  

Now a days if we, of course look for Yajnavalkya or Vyasa type of teachers it would be out limitation and shortsighted view of the teaching profession. I have got many friends even though not Sanskrit Teachers, loyal and committed to their profession.  

  

Thanks for all sharing their opinions.

  

I salute this Great Teacher of our times and all the teachers of all times honored in our tradition.  
  

If any of my comment hurt any member, please bear with me and correct me. If I can consider the 25 listed in Bhagavata as teachers, I will consider all of the members in this forum as my teachers (whether salaried or receiving pension).  
  

With regards
