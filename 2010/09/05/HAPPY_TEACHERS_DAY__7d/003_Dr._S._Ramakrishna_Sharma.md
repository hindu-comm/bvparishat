Respected Scholars,  
  
With due respect to the good intentions of all  
those who take the opportunity of "Teachers' Day"  
to offer pranams to "teachers",  
here is a query:  
  
Are the salaried species of today's knowledge industry  
"GURUS"?  
Is "Teachers' Day" constituted by Dr.S.Radhakrishnan  
equivalent to "Guru Poornima" wherein the verses on Guru  
fit in aptly?  
  
Are the following terms synonymous?  
उपाध्याय:  
अध्यापक:  
बोधक:  
चोदक:  
देशिक:  
उपदेष्टा  
आचार्य:  
दीक्षा गुरु:  
विद्या गुरु:  
(and perhaps, there many more, as mentioned in the *Siddhasiddhantapaddhati* of the Natha Traditions,  
and Guru Gita.)  
and  
गुरु: as दक्षिणामूर्ति:?
