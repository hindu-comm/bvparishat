obviously there is some omission in the quotation, if filled up  

  

the sentence may be as Wthout the study of Sanskrit nobody can become a true...etc.

  

and what about the expression** ****'research valuable papers'** in the sentence **...to participate and present ****highly research valuable papers** **on the above said theme....**

  

regards,

  

soma basu
