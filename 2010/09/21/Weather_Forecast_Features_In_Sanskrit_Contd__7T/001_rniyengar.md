Interesting information. The text reads like portents or omens  
(shakuna) but not exactly about weather. Such informatiion exists in  
texts like Brihat samhita, Adbhuta Sagara, Meghamala, KRishi  
Parashara. But omens can not be used by common people. Moon comes near  
Rohini once in about 27-28 nights. As far as weather /rainfall is  
concerned it is mostly the position of Sun that matters. This was of  
course very well known from the VEdic period (aadityaad jaayate  
vrishtih. This is the motto of the Inda Met. Dept.also). Rigveda  
states the rainfall cycle! Our ancients had uncanny ability to observe  
nature and draw scientific inferences. But ubfortunately the modern  
panchangas have messed up the rain inducing nakshatras. What was  
fairly correct for the period of Varaha Mihira has been wrongly  
interpreted. I am referring to the well known mistake of showing the  
UttarayaNa (winter solstice, shortest day in the year) on 14th January  
instead of 21 December. Observing the Pitr. tarpaNa on the wrong day  
may not matter very much since many prayaschittas are done to wash off  
the pratyavaaya dosha! But indicating rainfall at wrong times is  
costly to the farmers and the economy. I know I am very critical.  
Interested members may please read and comment on my papers published  
in a Science Journal:
