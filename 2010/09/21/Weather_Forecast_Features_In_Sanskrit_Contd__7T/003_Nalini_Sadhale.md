Dear scholar,  
Read your articles on rainfall variations as recorded in ancient  
Sanskrit texts. The topic is of my special interest. That the rain  
prediction theory based on the master planet of the year described in  
Krishiparashara implies seven year cycle of variations in Monsoon  
rainfall prediction is a valuable enlightenment.Many thanks,  
congratulations and best wishes.
