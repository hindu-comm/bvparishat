Respected Scholars, Namaskar!

Dr. Arun, "Oxford exercise was solely for destruction of Vedic culture and history as clearly declared in the  
aim of Boden Chair in 1831, but loyalists blindly copy them without even daring to see any original line of Sanskrit-"

I would like to make it clear once again that I am not one of the loyalists of Oxford Exercise. I have nothing to do with them.Please do not repeat the same old record when one refers to my posting on history. Please read my posting carefully. I did not deny existence of the ancient Dvaitavana. I was looking for archaeological evidence. There are other scholars on this list. Somebody may present evidence.If somebody knows Puranas, let him present his evidence. We would like to exchange views, not to label each others like Oxford loyalist etc. Please stop labeling others repeatedly and present your evidence. That is enough. Thanks. N.R.Joshi .
