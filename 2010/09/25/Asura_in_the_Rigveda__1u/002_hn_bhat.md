Thanks for the valuable information. Very interesting is the one is the etymology for Sura and Asura for their origin:

  

> १. तेनासुनासुरानसृजत। तदसुराणामसुरत्वम्। (तै.२।३।२।१॥)

  

> "सोर्देवान् असृजत तत़् सुराणां सुरत्वम्। असोरसुरानसृजत > तदसुराणामसुरत्वम्।"(तै.ब्रा.२.३.८.२,४)

  

What is "su" and "asu" are interesting from the point of deriving sura and asura with na\~n.

  

One more question? Were those Asura-s were like Deva-s, once upon a time, eligible for Sura or Soma once upon a time? When they were deprived of it and why? Is is suggested by Purvedeva" or Purvedeva simply implies devebhyaH pUrve jaataaH - Children of elder wife and younger wife according to Purana-s? Or a change in staturs occured debarring them from the benefits of being Sura-s? Except Puranic episode of Amrutamathana? which derives sura and asura-s accordingly, eligible for Sura and ineligible for Sura-s?

  

An interesting topic is under discussion.

  

Thanks once again for Sadashivamurthy for his valuable contribution throwing light in the evolution of the meaning of the word.

  

With regards
