\>Tradition accepts adhidaiva, adhiyanjna and adhyatma as three possible modes of  
interpretation.  
  

The Taittireeya Upanishat also provides(five possible modes) adhi-loka, adhi-jyoutisha, adhi-vidya,  
adhi-praja and adhi-atma aspects which can be derived according to the context, as the case may be.  
Perhaps, the asura, asuryaa reference in the context of adhi-loka can be seen in the  
pondering/soliloquy of Nachiketa in another Upanishat, viz. "asuryaa naama tE lokaa:.."

  
  
\>My question about ‘Asura’ was from the above view point.  
  

Similar pair which intrigue the interpreters is the Sam-bhuti and Asam-bhuti  
of the IshAvAsya Upanishat.  
  
Pranams.
