\>Could the confusion of above terms may have further contributed to interpret our ancient texts?  
  

Perhaps, terms gather interchangeable connotations during the course of time; a search for usages  
in the Maha Kavyas, commentaries and vishva koshas may be of help.  
  
Consider the expressions like nara-raakshasa, naraadhama and nara-pishaacha.  
A collateral correlative like terms are : barbarians, man-eaters, cannibals, giants  
and the like.  
  
"इतिहासपुराणाभ्यां वेद: समुपबृंहयेत् " is a traditional claim which ought to help  
the scholars stand/withstand the test of concord and clarity  
Pranams..
