My request is : Regarding the etymologies, one must be very vigilant. Kenaapi vRttisaamaanyena is not a good principle particularly for historical etymology. The Brahmanas and epics and puranas in a number of cases are trying to make the etymology on the similar sound and suitable to their context also. Even Nirukta gives a number of etymologies which may be suitable or not suitable to the original Vedic text. I think the works of Walde, Pakorney and Myerhofer are useful for historical etymologies. They must be used but with caution. Regards, spnarang
