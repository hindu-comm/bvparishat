Dear Members,  
My subject title was about "Asura in the Rigveda". As we go beyond  
RV, meanings can be several. In RV the word is used to address  
deities such as agni, indra, varuNa, (not just maruts)considered  
usually as Deva. Vrtra eventhough an Asura he is qualified as 'Deva'.  
(as'vyo vaara abhavaatad indra [sr.ke](http://sr.ke) yattvaa pratyahn deva ekah.\| Rv  
1.32.12) SaayaNa-bhaashya explains this 'deva' as 'dipyamaanah.'  
Hence my curiosity about the adhi-daiva meanings, which appear to be  
quite realistic. There was a question whether all the three types of  
interpretations are available. In my humble opinion the BrahmaNas and  
the Yajurveda Samhita+Brahmanas devlop the adhiyajna in great detail.  
Upanishads have taken care of the adhyatma. The celestial Daiva based  
practice (religion?) is the popular Hinduism. AraNyaka, at least  
Tai.araNyaka provides some Daivika information about seasons and as I  
said in another post about Abhaya-Dhruva in the group of 14 stars  
called Shishumaara. It also mentions about Meru and Kshyapa not  
setting. The tripartite meaning is of course only an academic approach  
of discussion to preserve the knowledge and culture. \[All the three  
are perhaps to be combined in actual day to day life. But I was not  
discussing this practical aspect in my posting.\]. I had mentioned  
about 'Svarbhaanu' in RV being correlated with 'Aasura'. This is  
perhaps a Vr.ddhi on 'asura'. I would like to know the view of the  
scholars whether 'asura' could be interpreted as 'one having several  
lives'. Is "bhvarthe ra pratyayah." applicable?
