Dear Scholars,

  

I had been curiously watching the different turns the topic of discussion on the interpretation of the term "Asura" has taken.

  

Just a question. Not any of serious like the other posts. I have often seen that there are three layers of meaning for Vedic texts very frequently. Has any commentator from Skandaswamy up to Dayananda Saraswathy explored all the three layers of meaning in their commentaries FOR ALL The mantra-s and brahmana-s and upanishads? If so name please? If not, why? Didn't they know there are three layers?

  

It is an approved fact that there are Gunavada-s and Artha-vaada-s accepted as easiest to resolve any anomalies between the sentences in a part and the other in interpreting them.  

  

If this question is out of place, please ignore this.
