I am delighted with the discussion and various informations that are  
pouring in. However my curiosity is about how scholars think the words  
Asura, Asuratvam, Aasura, Aasuryam etc should be understood in the  
Rigveda Samhita as is available to us now. I accept meanings that have  
come down to us through tradition are naturally important. But my  
question is should we be satisfied with them? Do the Nirukta,  
BrahmaNa, PuraNa explanations (not all of them are etymologies)  
explain consistently Rigvedic Deva and Asura? One can easily point out  
conflicts and inconsistencies, but I will not do that here. I like to  
argue within the bounds of tradition only. Tradition accepts  
adhidaiva, adhiyanjna and adhyatma as three possible modes of  
interpretation. Adhiyajna and Adhyaatma are very well preserved in the  
Yaajnika and Upanishadic (purva and Uttara miimaamsa) literature. But  
what happened to the adhidaiva? In my humble opinion PuraaNam (in  
singular) to some extent preserved this. But with too many puraaNas  
cropping up with additions over time, including regional variations it  
is very difficult to interpret RV using PuraNas (except for the  
Visvedeva nivid of 3339 devas with the help of BrahmaaNDa puraaNa).  
But this can not be a reason for us to give up the exercise. I am  
convinced that there is no proper scholarly adhidaiva tradition that  
has come down to us (please correct me, if wrong). Its reflection is  
seen here and there in the Nirukta, SayaNa Bhashya and perhaps in  
other places unknown to me. For example the adhidaiva meaning of Soma  
is said to be Moon. Hence why should we always harp on Somayaaga as a  
ritual for Somapaana? This happens because we are conditioned to take  
only the adhiyajna meaning. Somapaana as per adhidaiva would be  
drinking of the moon by the gods that is a reference only to the  
KrishNapaksha waning moon. In other words a picture of the sky  
(however incomplete it may be) as perceived by the Rigvedic seers can  
be approximately figured out with a consistent adhidaiva approach.  
Another example: The famous hymns (RV 1.162 & 1.163) on Aśva by  
Aucathya are traditionally taken to refer to Aśvamedha. But these  
hymns primarily describe a bright horse-like object moving in the sky.  
I concede the horse-sacrifice is inspired by this hymn. But what was  
it that was moving in the sky? An adhyatma meaning may be available in  
the Upanishads. But the sky picture is very interesting and perhaps  
can be used to say that the horse-like object was seen near aapade-goh  
(cow’s foot) which should be the nakshatra later known as  
Proshthapada. If this is consistent at other places (3.39.5) where the  
cow’s-foot (earth as per adhiyajna) is located in the sky, a small  
progress would have happened since beyond Aghaa & Arjuni one more RV  
nakshatra would have been deciphered.

The yaajnika and adhyatma meanings are self consistent within  
themselves. I am quite convinced on that count. In other words, the  
sacrificial deva and asuras were not same as the mystical ones of the  
Upanishads and were not same as the ones meant in the PuraaNa. In one  
place they were mostly symbolic, in the other place psychic entities  
and in the third (adhidaiva) place real observed physical objects. My  
question about ‘Asura’ was from the above view point. Similarly when  
agni is said to be moving in the SKY with smoke (dhuumena dhaavate  
divi\|\| RV 6.48.6) however one may argue for sacrificial and mystical  
meanings the simple primary picture of a fire-ball or meteor or comet  
in the sky is logically more likely since it needs minimum  
explanations (Naiyaayika principle: Laaghavaat).  
It is possible even within RV a word like ‘asura’ modified its  
meaning. This would have happened as the RV samhita corpus represents  
some 800-1000 years of time span or more. Nevertheless ‘Asura’ is not  
used as an exact opposite of ‘sura’ which does not find place in RV  
(like to be corrected if wrong). Hence I submit there should be a  
study of RV from the point of view of the ‘actions’ performed by the  
‘deva’ and ‘asura’. If we list all of these as a table, those actions  
which fit in with the context of the hymn in the maximum number of  
cases is the most likely major attribute assigned to Deva/Asura by the  
composers.

kind regards
