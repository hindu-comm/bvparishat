I forgot to mention that Samudra-manthana is depicted on a Panel from Ganesh Lena, Ellora, ca. 11th cent. CE. Deva and Da_nava churn the ocean, using the Va_suki, the serpent as the rope and Mandara, the mountain as the churning rod. Deva hold the tail and the Da_nava the head of the serpent. From the churned ocean emerge ambrosia (amr.ta) and other treasures.<http://blog.creaders.net/ebola/upload_file/20080125060136.jpg>
