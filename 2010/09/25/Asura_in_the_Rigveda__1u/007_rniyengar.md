Some Geographical Markers in Rv associated with Maruts  
There are several geographical locations mentioned in RV correlated  
with maruts. In the first book hymn (1.186) mentions maruts to be  
flying over Irina with their sparkling missiles. Irina, a place or  
a region named six times in RV, is traditionally translated as desert.  
Later Vedic texts identify Irina with disaster. Recently it has been  
shown that this region, during the time of RV, should have been  
spatially contiguous with the present day Rann-of-kutch . The spatial  
extent of the spread of maruts, even if these were at different  
periods of time is quite wide. In (5.52.9) maruts are described to  
crush the hills near River Parusnī, which is identified with River  
Rāvi in Punjab. In book eight we read

susome śaryanāvatyārjike pastyāvati \| yayuh nicakrayā narah \|\|  
(8.7.29)

Maruts went downwards to Susoma, Rjīka, Śaryanāvati, full of  
dwellings.

This verse has clear geographical information about where maruts were  
supposed to have gone prior to the composition of this hymn. Sāyana  
takes this to be the Rjīka country, full of Soma (plants), where  
Śaryanāvatī was a lake. This is in line with Vedic tradition where  
the horse’s head was hit by vajra, the weapon of Indra  
(vide:Brhaddevata). Maruts are addressed in the past tense and one  
gets the impression the poet is referring to past events in this  
laudation. In RV (10.75.5) Ārjikā and Susomā are listed along with a  
river named after maruts as Marudvrdhā. These rivers are generally  
identified to be in Punjab. In RV (5.52.17) maruts are connected with  
River Yamunā, which almost surely would not have been following the  
course of the present day river of the same name. Maruts are also  
mentioned linked with rivers Indus, Krumu, Kūbhā, Sarayū further north-  
west of greater India. A wide region is covered if the connection  
between the maruts as showers of meteoritic objects and the river  
names are taken together in a physical sense. Precise delineation of  
the region is difficult without some logical basis for organizing the  
RV hymns chronologically. An interesting reference in this regard is  
to the famed River Sarasvatī. In RV (2.30.8) this river is said to  
have been followed by maruts. In the famous prayer to Sarasvatī by  
Vasistha, first the river is addressed asuryā and in the next verse  
her friends are said to be maruts (7.96.1, 2). The word asuryā has  
been rendered in several translations as divine, but the connection  
with maruts indicates the epithet to be a physical description of the  
flowing river affected by maruts who were always called asurāh:  
throwers (of stones). Significantly, in the tenth book (10.17.8-9)  
goddess Sarasvatī is invoked seated in the same chariot as the  
ancestor deities. This in vaidika parlance means the river had dried,  
which, in the language of RV should have been after frequent sightings  
of maruts in the visible sky above the River Sarasvatī(circa 1900BCE).  
The two events might have been broadly contemporaneous even if  
meteorites were not the primary reason to dry up the river. There  
should have been something fiery about the river Sarasvati before  
dessication. Later PuraNa particularly Skaanda-prabhaasa kshetra  
maahaatmya elaborates celestial fire as the reason for the drying up  
of Sarasvati.

\> \> मुखबाहूरुपज्जानां या लोके जातयो बहि:।  
\> \> म्लेच्छवाचश्चार्यवाच: सर्वे ते दस्यव: स्मृता:॥ १०अध्या.४५ तमश्लो.॥
