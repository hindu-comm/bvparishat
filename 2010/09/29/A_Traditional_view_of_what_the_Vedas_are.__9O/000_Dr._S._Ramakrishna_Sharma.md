अभिवन्द्य,

Does it present unscientific postulates?  
आन्ध्यत्व - मान्द्यत्व - पटुत्व - धर्म: of the senses and the anta:karaNaM  
cannot be overcome by any external appliances. Hence the Brahma  
Sutras categorically emphasize जगद्व्यापारवर्जं ईश्वरत्वं, that the human  
beings are empowered potentially to know and act except in a way Ishvara  
is cosmically capable of. कर्तुं अकर्तुं अन्यथा वा कर्तुं is NOT possible by any being, be it  
human or celestial.  
"स्यादीश्वरत्वं " of the Sri Dakshinamurthy Stotram of Sri Adi Shankara connotes what  
he commented upon in the Brahma Sutra bhasshyam, as जगद्व्यापारवर्जं
ईश्वरत्वं.  
This does not prevent research into the adhi-daivam domain.  
But what exactly is adhi-daivam? Does it mean the astro-physical  
bodies such as "Agastya"/Canopus? Or does it mean the अभिमानिदेवता, the Presiding  
Consciousness as referred to in the प्रणववार्तिकं of the समाधिविधि: usually given to the  
initiated fourth ashrama disciples of Sringeri Parampara?  
अध्यात्मं अधिभूतं अधिदैवं in the above context are experiential and NOT interpretative.  
If adhi-bhutam means and includes all that is physical and elemental where is the question  
of adhi-daivam being the celestial/astronomical bodies? If the three are mutually distinctive  
and separate domains(they are, by definition), the latter two cannot be synonyms or of similar categories!
