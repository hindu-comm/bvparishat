namo vidvadbhyah  
  
In the Telugu Translation of Mahabharata , done by NannapArya (Nannayya) of 11 Century AD  
the folloing text is found (poem) which shows that the Epic is viewed differently by different scholars -  
  
dharmatattvajnas - dharmasAstram  
adhyAtmavidah - vedAntah  
nItivicaksanas - nItisAstram  
kavivrsabhas - mahAkavyam  
paurAnikAh - purAnasamuccayah  
AitihAsikas - itihAsah etc.  
  
Niti is both nIti and RAjanIti . KAvyam - mahAkAvyam / mahAvAkyam . VedAnta especially in  
SAntiparva , SesvarasAmkhya and Yoga also in the same Parva . Dharma = dharmasUksmas,  
just like Kundakas and Golakas .  
  
Statements like 'vayam panca satam ca te' ( DharmarAja ) , i.e. if there is a war with otheres we  
are one hundred and five and if it is between us we are five and they are hundred , are applicable  
between countries , states and even homes .  
  
dhanyo'smi  
It is , in fact, (apart from History) a treasure of multiple 'subjects' without match . Even Vyakaranam took some examples ( manIvostrasya lambete priyau vatsatarau mama , bhUtAni  
kalah pacatIti vArtA / kalah pacati bhUtAni etc.) .
