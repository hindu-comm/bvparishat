Respected Scholars, Namaskar!

How to interpret the ancient scriptures (especially Mahabharat) of India?  
Using astrology, or astronomy, or archaeology, or natural phenomenon or Adhyaatmavaada?

I read the book, “Political History of India by Hemachandra Raychauduri”. This book has many details which I used in my research.

I am not involved in determining the date of Mahabharat.  
My position is this-I am interested in collecting concrete evidence about Mahabharat to prove that it is not mythology (as publicly announced by Noble Laureate Dr. Amartya Sen from History Conference in Calcutta-He said Rama and Krishna are mythological and not historical.2001)

Different Scholars have different motives to look into the ancient scriptures of India. This is a healthy situation. Indian well known archaeologist Dr. B. B. Lal travels all over the world discussing Aryan problem and archaeology of India. I met him three times. His papers have wealth of information. He knows that all problems in the ancient Indian history are not solved. More research is needed.

Now let us come to Dr, R. N. Iyengar.  
Quoting  
“About Indra, it is possible in some places of RV Indra is a real earthly person. But this can not be generalized to all places. So also about Mitra, VaruNa, Ashvins.”

Your interpretation of scriptural passages from astronomical point of view is well received and appreciated by many. I read some of your papers. I am not generalizing. Here is my problem-If I assume that Indra etc are celestial phenomenon, then Krishna having war with him also becomes celestial phenomenon. Then Indra’s apsaras become celestial and not from this earth. This leads to apsara-Menaka, Vishvamitra, Shakuntala, Bharata all become celestial phenomenon. Please tell me where to draw the line-which are celestials from our scriptures and which were earthly historical figures? We are in this state of confusion from the past 2500 years of known history. If Indra is different from earthly real person in some passages from scriptures, I leave it to the other scholars.

Here is the important question-Why do we find archaeological references to Indra, Mitra, Varun, Nasatya and Chyavan rishi being made young again by Ashvina Kumaras in countries outside of the subcontinent and not within the subcontinent? In order to prove the antiquity of Vedas, Dr. B. B. Lal has quoted archaeological evidence from outside countries in one of his papers. If anybody has papers stating the discovery of concrete archaeological (inscriptions or tablets, documents before 1350 BC) evidence of Indra etc within the subcontinent, please let me know. I will add that in my presentation. I am not dogmatic.  
Earthly Indra was involved in the politics of all the ancient countries around his Nandanavana. He had wife and son. He came hurriedly to shut down the fires of the Khandava vana burnt down by Krishna and Arjuna. I am looking for locations of both these two Vanas either in ancient India or in outside world. I will appreciate highly if someone offers me concrete information. Thanks. N. R. Joshi.
