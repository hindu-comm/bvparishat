Hello,  
In Malayalam we have all the three- ന് നു് ന്‍ and siilar is the case  
of ണ് etc. ന് is used to denote the consonant without "a" which is  
supposed to be there with every consonant for the sake of pronouncing  
the same. In the end of words ന് will not stand as such and so  
"samvrtokara" is added and hence നു് . Chillukal are consonants which  
can stand without consonant marker since they have separate letters.

Yes, these are interchangeable sometimes.

Yes, when they are not followed by a vowel.  
A.R.Rajarajavarma has dealt with all these things in his  
Keralapaniniyam (see pithika).
