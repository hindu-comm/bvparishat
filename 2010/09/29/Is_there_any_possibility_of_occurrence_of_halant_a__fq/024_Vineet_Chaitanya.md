Dear Shri H.N. Bhat,  
  
Please do not try to read too much in a name! Would anybody use "halant sign" in Devanagari, to get hal part of कि?  
  
My purpose was simply to point out the essential nature of the Brahmi based scripts.  
  
As I mentioned, for various reasons, languages do overload symbols. If its function has been generalised in Malayalam, for the convenience of using it on a typewriter, to subtract any vowel let it be so. Now that typewriters are outdated, it may be better, in my opinion, to revert back to separate symbols, to avoid unnecessary confusions.
