Dear Jagannath,  
  
I have produced below the 4 combinations you are referring to.  
The left ones have a 'u' vowle indicator and a 'chandrakala' - a halanta marker.  
The right ones are the modern glyps, called chillu.  
  
  
നു്, ന്‍ = न्  
ണു്, ണ്‍ = ण्  
ലു്, ല്‍ = ल्  
ളു്, ള്‍ = ळ्  
I have two questions:  
a) Are these interchangeable?  
b) Can we also write the left ones without halanta marker, to indicate the same akshar?
