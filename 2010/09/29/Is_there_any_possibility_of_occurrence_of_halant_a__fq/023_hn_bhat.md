Thanks for clarification by both. I may add that Mr.Vineet forgot the very important function of the sign called "halant" sign to add in his first post, which I was also intending to point out. In other words, it is used to exhibit 'hal' separately from the complete अक्षर "क" by subtracting the other letter (which is of zero value in the alphabet).

  

And this function is never conveyed by the name 'halant' given to the sign :) It could have been as 'hal' sign contrast with 'ac' sign corresponding to consonant sign and vowel sign (following a consonant), but it would not work as it is alway many in vowel signs differ in isolation and when preceded by consonants and consonant signs differ when in conjunct with other consonants and when followed by vowels and in the final position. Especially this sign is used as marker of consonants in their final position or rarely isolated to the exclusion of the 'a' used in the alphabet.

  

By very name sign 'halant = ending in consonant", doesn't have anything to do with its function. It would convey only the sign ending in consonant, which is to mark the preceding letter as 'hal' or consonant. This I wanted to bring out. In this respect, its use is in no better position than the use of 'cil' sign equated to it in Malayalam by function (which is native to that language and script). If this sign is used to exhibit 'hal' part of the complete letter "क", THE SAME LOGIC applied to exhibit "samvruta U' from the complete vowel letter U IN isolation (both native to it).  
  
Sorry for my cute remarks.

  

Thanks again for all who contributed to this topic, which was interesting by itself.
