Let us first know what halant is? A halant is a word which ends with a consonant sound, for instance, फलम्, रामम् are halant words, because they end with म् sound (a consonant). In Sanskrit and Hindi the sign hanging below the म is a signal for absence of any vowel (not only of अ). So, if a vowel is present in any form, this very symbol can't be used to denote that vowels's absence.



Nowdays, the word halant is also usedto refer tothis particular symbol, which does not seem correct. Our orthrographic system assumes that a letter is always accompanied by a vowel. So, if you need to denote a letter without vowel, you put this particular symbol below that letter, and this symbol makes the letter vowel-less.  
  
However, in other languages such symbols could be used to denote the length of the vowels. And this should be understood from the writing convetion of the languages, and that would be language specific. The case of writing system cannot be generalized for all languages.



Thanks and regards,
