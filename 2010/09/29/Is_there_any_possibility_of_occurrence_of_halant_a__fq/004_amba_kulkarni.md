Dear Jagannath,  
  
I checked with the Malayalam speaker here.  
  
The confusion is because of the old convention of writing malayalam. In case of such characters which have 'u' vowel indicator and a chandrakalaa (halanta marker in malayalam), the characters should be treated as special one. There are 4 such consonants in Malayalam. So these should not be confused with the regular u-ending consonants.  
  
You may like to check the ISCII document which must have discussed this feature.  
  
In the modern Malayalam, I understand, these 4 consonants have been replaced by special glyphs for them.  
  
I hope this helps you.
