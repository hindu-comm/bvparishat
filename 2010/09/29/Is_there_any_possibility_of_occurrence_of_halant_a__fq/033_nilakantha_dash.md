Dear Members of Bidvatparisat  
I am a new member looking at discussions. First of all this interaction is great.  
about halant I agree with Vineet and Dr Harinarayan of pundichery.  
to add-  
there are ajanta (ac-anta) and halanta words in sanskrit. means that ends with a vowel and that ends with a consonant.  
So ac means a vowel and hal means a consonant.(as per paninian system)  
When hal-anta sign is put after some alphabet, that means it is hal only without any ac (vowel) following.
