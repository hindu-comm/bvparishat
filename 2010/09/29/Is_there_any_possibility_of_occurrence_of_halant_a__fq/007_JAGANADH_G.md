The four consonants are called ass CHILLUS, which is pure consonants where it can exists without any vowel attached to it. These four characters having glyphs from vey early times. Now it is in Unicode also.  
It is not the case which I mentioned . some people who works in the field of malayalam grammar and NLP argues that a usual halant ending word may written with an 'u'sign + halant sign. I feel it as illogical . That is why i raised the question here.
