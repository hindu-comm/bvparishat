Please keep following points in mind:  
  
 1. The script does not have any basic symbol for hal. All consonants have an added अ.  
 2. This is unlike Roman script which has pure consonants. However, for the convenience of pronunciation some arbitrary vowels are added which are not really part of the consonants symbol.  
 ि = ् +इ  
 So वि = व +ि = व + ् +इ. There is no need to go beyond this step because every thing has been expressed in terms of the basic symbols of the script.  
  
 Yes one can add any number of (अ + ्) to any equality. Just as in mathematics one can add to any number, any number of \[1 + (-1)\] pairs without changing the value of the number.
