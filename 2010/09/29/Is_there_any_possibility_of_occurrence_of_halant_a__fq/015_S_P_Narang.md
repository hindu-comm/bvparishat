Halanta marker is only for the facility of students. Hal is an independent sound without a vowel. that is why hal k is diferent from ka. To mark hal is only to show that it is independent. In actual pronunciation, ending hal is pronounced with a vowel in a number of languages. At the end it is prolonged also. e.g. kaaaa particularly in music which does not necessarily follow grammar. that is why ai and au are not spoken in Hindi and it changes to a mild e and o. It is exculsively found in Pali which is a differentiating feature of Pali and Prakrit. Prakrit preserves both like many Modern Indian languages whereas Pali does not. Pronunciation without a script and with script should be differentiated. Regards, spnarang
