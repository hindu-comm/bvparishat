Sir,

That I have tried to show. It can substract any vowel not only अ. If we have a word like वृद्धि, its components would be analysed as follows:



वृद्धि = व् + ऋ + द् + ध् + इ.

Here undoubtedly, the halant signhas beenused to show the absence of vowels ऋ, 0, and इ respectively. Thus, we can't say this sign substracts only अ vowel.
