Madam  
  
നു് not equal to ന്‍ . I will explain it with usages  
1) അവനു് (avanu) mean 'to him' --> here the ending is 'നു് '  
2) അവന്‍ (avan) means he --> here the ending is ന്‍  
നു് and ന്‍ are not interchangeable . If we do so the morphological as well ass the semantic feature of the word will be altered. Most of the words ends with CHILLU will be in Nominative case.  
  
നു് is used interchange with ന് .
