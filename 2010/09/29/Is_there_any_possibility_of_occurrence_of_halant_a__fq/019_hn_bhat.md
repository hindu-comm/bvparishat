Dear Jagannath,

  

Our friend Maheswaran Nair also has exactly confirmed my reply quoting Gundert and ARR. It is only merely conventional that it it is used when printing convention than typesetting in the older times have taken place. The sign is conveniently used in respect of consonants with the sign as in Sanskrit क and क् ക and ക്.

Dr.S R Sharma has also reinstated my statement in my earlier post regarding their prevalence.

  

You choose to call them as "halant sign" as you use it to identify in technical contexts the constant ക क whereas in other context it is implied and technically explained as vyanjana-s that need vowels to explicitly present their audible form. In Varnamala, it has been explained also by the commentators in Sanskrit.

  

In contrast to Sanskrit, this Samvruta Ukaara is special character for Malayalam, it is used in respect of this special vowel also, which was always conveyed by the normal writing. In the new printing convention, it was invented to replace the original letters used in earlier printing. The very simple logic is Malayalam script where it can use its own signs. The other logic is if you can use the sign to show separately the "hal" from the letter ക with the sign, you can use the same to show separate "vowel u" from the letter ഉ. instead of inventing a new sign for the use of a single vowel. I had noted this earlier in my posting as it was called as "half u-kaara" by some and with the same logic, if ക് is half of the letter ക, BY THE SAME LOGIC, ഉ will take the same sign with it as half. The final consonants had distinct letters in respect of special phonemes for Malayalam as I had noted. The sign is used to replace them to the advantage of minimizing the number of type fonts (elimenating earlier 4-6)

  

But on other hand it would be wrong to label it as "halant" sign as it is exclusively used in Sanskrit, while this is used exclusively in Malayalam language and script to the exclusion of Devanagari script and Sanskrit Language.

  

Can you on your part come forth with a logical justification of naming the sign used in writing Sanskrit in Devanagari Script, as "halant" sign and the logic behind it? Somebody had raised the same question in a post long ago. Anyway, grammar has nothing to do with these signs used in writing. Thats a different thing. Alphabets are enumerated and explained therein to some extent. Panini notes dialectal variations for some phonemes as "sannatara, laghuprayatnatara" which could not at all be represented in orthography without having the necessity of it. 

  

To repeat the question again, can you explain what you mean "halant sign" and logic behind using it (the term)?

  

With regards
