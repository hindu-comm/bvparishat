Please note I used the word "halant" loosely for the "halant marker" because it was so in the original mail. Normal task of "halant marker" is to subtract the immediately preceding "अ". If there is no preceding "अ" then one is specifying impossible operation. Other languages might overload the symbol to do some other function.
