To repeat the question again, can you explain what you mean "halant sign" and logic behind using it (the term)?  
  

 1. In Devanagari script the units अक्षर (akshar) are "vowel ending syllables" e.g. प्रि (pri).  
  
 2. The representation of simple consonants by default end in vowel अ(a). Thus प stands for "pa". In other words there are no pure consonants(hal) in the script. This has been done wisely for the sake of brevity in writing. So "kamala" according to this convention could be written as "kml".  
  
 3. When a pure consonant (hal) is needed it is indicated by the "hal marker". So it has been recommended that "halant sign" should be called "hal sign".  
  
 4. However, one can justify the usage "halant sign" also in the following manner:  
  
 Because technically one may need a sequence of pure consonants which thus ends in a hal, so such a sequence is "halant". So the mark to show this would be called "halant sign". The क्ष् (ksh) in the dhatu भक्ष् (bhaksh) is an example. (Please note because of the defects in the fonts the display on your machine may not be correct.)  
  
 5. By the way, some people may find it interesting to note the following equation:  
  
 "A vowel sign (मात्रा)" = "halant sign" + "the corresonding vowel"  
 e.g. ी = ् + ई  
  
 As a matter of fact the above should hold for all Brahmi based scripts.  
  
 Now, it is also true that all sorts of arbitrary overloading has been done in these scripts. For example in Marathi to write "bara" one would write "बरं" because if one simply writes it as "बर" it would be pronounced as "बर्" (bar) because of the common habit of dropping the last vowel अ!
