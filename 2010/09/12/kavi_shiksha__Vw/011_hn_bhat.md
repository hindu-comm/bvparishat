Thanks for your response. Yes. I am disappointed again to see the same things known to any serious student of Alankarashastra, in Sanskrit. The point in question could be resolved with some quotations where the "Kavishiksha" occured. "Kavikanthabharana" of Kshemendra, Kavikalpalata-and its Viveka, and so on there are many handbooks meant for poets as I had indicated in my earlier post. I again quote the point raised in the first post to remind the focus point:

Thanks once again for the detailed account of the concept of Kavishiksha.

  

But that doesn't answer the question raised in the first post.

  

The question will drop us in the same position as our Great Commentator
(I mean महाभाष्यकार) said:

  

प्रयुक्तानां शब्दानामिदमन्वाख्यानाम्।....

  

तद् यथा घटेन कार्यं करिष्यन् कुम्भकारकुलं गत्वा आह "कुरु घटम्, कार्यमनेन करिष्यामि" इति, न तद्वत् शब्दान् प्रयोक्ष्यमणः वैयाकरणकुलं गत्वा आह -कुरु,शब्दान् प्रयोक्ष्ये" इति।

  

तन्न्यायेन, सिद्धकाव्यसामग्रीनामनुशासनमेव काव्यशास्त्रेण क्रियते, काव्यप्रयोक्तारश्च तद् यथोपयोगं प्रयुञ्जते इत्येव।

  

Sorry for joking with the quotation from Mahabhashya. Even though Grammar started as "Anushasanam" Descriptive in nature, it became prescriptive, "shasana" in later times and developed as a specialized science of Grammar. In the same way, the analysis of "Kavyasamaagri" available to the Bharata and his followers served as guide to the latter poets. It is casually considered as the origin of काव्य, as asserted by Mammata, the speaker of his time for poetics,

  

"काव्यज्ञशिक्षयाभ्यासः इति हेतुस्तदुद्भवे"

  

वृद्धसेवावेक्षणम्, १.३.११ of Vamana is explained by Mammata also.

  

All of these analyzed the poetry and the causes of its origin among other things. अन्वाख्यान and which could be conveniently used by the poets as manuals for them. But I am afraid, the object of the poetic works is not mainly कविशिक्षा. I am afraid, I also treading the same path pointed out in my earlier post.

  

Yet the question stands unresolved affirmatively or negatively.
