Dear Sir,

  

Just see Dr. Jagannatha's post. I also was thinking of it, but on Jagannatha's confirmation, it is proved that it was not a coined word recently.

  

Probably, the above two writers might have taken clue from the phrase of Mammata, काव्यज्ञशिक्षयाभ्यासः suitably adopted to highlight the other part i.e. receiving end of the blooming poet in naming their work. Also the word used in the sense of general poetics, by modern writers as extended application, as काव्यज्ञशिक्षा of Mammata, is only rephrasing of Bhamaha' कृत्वा विद्वदुपासनम्, and Vamana's "वृद्धसेवा". This much only could be arrived at. In the works on poetics of Jain writers beginning from Hemachandra, we find many topics commonly accepted as poetic conventions, which need special attention in their usage and in one work I found the selected vocabulary of a large amount of words taken from poetic contexts suitable for their usage in poems.

  

Anyhow, the date of the usage of the term, as inquired by the starter of the topic, could not go back from 13th century as suggested by Dr.Jagannath.  
  

Thanks for all who contributed to this topic from different angles.

  

With regards
