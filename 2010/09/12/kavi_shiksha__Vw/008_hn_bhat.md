Dear Bhagavanji,

  

Rightly said by you and Dr. Sadashiva Murthy. I am afraid in many topics, the discussion moves from the point in focus like this, as I observed. I had been observing this and waiting for some one who can attest first the usage of the word "kavishiksha" and I am sure, the scholar raised this question was already familiar of its probable meaning in poetics.

  

I also could not remember any work specifically having used precisely the term "कविशिक्षा". Even though Vamana mentions some principles to be followed by poets deserved to be taught, he doesn't name his topic as कविशिक्षा. अरोचकिनः सतृणाभ्यवहारिणश्च कवयः, तत्र पूर्वे शिष्या नेतरे (२.१-२) he felt it necessary to provide a manual or guide to poets. This aspect has been extended to poetic convention also as कविसमय. as Rajashekhara describes for the convenience of blooming poets for whom he had set a routine to follow dairy. But I have not come in his book also this term. I don't remember having met this words in well-known works on poetics.

  

But I dared not to say it is in currency when we are referring to the works on Poetics as I could not attest it. As our Great Commentator has declared it. "

"सप्तद्वीपा वसुमती। चत्वारो वेदाः साङ्गाः सरहस्याः ....

एतावन्तं शब्दराशिमननुनिशम्य साहसमेतत् अस्त्यप्रयुक्तमेतत् ’.

  

None has come with a testimony to its usage in the works of poetics from our group of scholars. I could not find the word in the online database corups of sanskrit dictionary. कविरहस्य is the chapter lost in Kavyamimamsa.

  

Revered opinions of the scholars in this direction is solicited by me also, though it is seen used in articles and books referring to the works on poetics.

  

With regards
