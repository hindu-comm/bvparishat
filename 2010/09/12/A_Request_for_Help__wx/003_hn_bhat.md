I also have read the same opinions about the book in some other websites and discussions.

  

I remember a verse from the same book was sought explanation for. But no solution was yet found nor attempt was made to find the two fold interpretation for the Vandana shloka, composed in katapayadi-numeric style for astrological works. Without the explanation by the author who composed, it would be difficult for any scholar to derive at the two fold, leave it the real meaning literal one in its literary sense.

  

I think somebody had presented it here in some topic.

  

I also do not know anything about mathematics or astronomy or astrology.
