It may not be, but it isn't what I said, as you may note.

I doubt that very much, since entrance exams (at least at the high school and college levels where they are common) generally test on more advanced concepts (basic algebra, coordinate geometry, trigonometry, set theory, etc.), not basic arithmetic. Skill in arithmetic is also quite weakly correlated with ability in such topics -- there are any number of skilled accountants and others who excel at arithmetic but couldn't become proficient in trigonometry or algebra to save their lives, and conversely there are quite skilled engineers and scientists who do not excel at arithmetic.

In any event, it would be a mistake, in my opinion, to presume that learning is for the purpose of being able to clear (entrance) exams. Such thinking is already the bane of our educational system, with results like only 23% of engineering graduates being employable, etc. It is quite unfortunate that there is almost no advocacy of the liberal arts in our society.

\> There is a even more important benefit for a lot of students in the form of losing fear of Maths. I have personally seen children benefit by learning to love maths and get better at it by Abacus training (though they teach only basic operations like addition, multiplciation etc.).

This would indeed be welcome, provided students develop all-round reasoning ability, besides the skills involved in solving specific types of exam problems, and don't learn to think that math is merely doing sums.

\> Regarding "Vedic" Maths. Forget about nomenclature. Are the methods described there more efficient? Do they throw light on novel ways of approaching the problem(s)? If so, then they should be exploited.

From a classical perspective, "Vedic mathematics" simply isn't -- न च केनचित् कृत्वा "वेद" इत्युक्तं वेदसमम् -- परम्परा अभावात् (विष्णुतत्वविनिर्णय). That takes away the adjective, and what we are left with is the mathematics presented, which simply isn't that unique or interesting really. I suppose one could say that being able to do arithmetic fast (by whatever method) is an advantage, but it is so only in the sense that speed-reading is an advantage. Based on my own experiences, I would have to say that such advantages are quite minor (neither I nor any student of mine would benefit significantly by them). What really count are depth of scholarship, all-round understanding, analytical skills, appreciation of the humanities, etc. The old adage सङ्गीतसाहित्यकलानभिज्ञः साक्षात् पशुः पुच्छविषाणहीनः holds even if the individual concerned can speed-read 2000 words a minute and multiply five-digit numbers in his head.
