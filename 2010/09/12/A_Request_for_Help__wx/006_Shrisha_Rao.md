\> Yes. I understand the mood of request by Dr. Sadashiva Murty Ji. I remember a person by name Shanabhag (as i remember) used to teach vedic maths in Bangalore - Aksharam in Girinagar. Pl contact Somebody in Aksharam or Hindu seva pratishthan, Bangalore for this, where some classes were held.

Wikipedia says, "In England, the method is used by teacher Satish Sharma with students in Slough, as well as by Kenneth Williams, teacher, author and spokesman for the Maharishi School in Skelmersdale, Lancashire, both of whom claim that the methods offer significant results for their pupils" -- see <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swami_Bharati_Krishna_Tirtha%27s_Vedic_mathematics>. At the risk of belaboring my previous point, these claimed stray instances do seem a bit far-out, though. The Trachtenberg system is also not in common use or widely taught, because fast mental arithmetic is no longer a skill much in demand these days. The current thinking in mathematics education seems more focused on addressing problems arising at the higher secondary and college levels (where students encounter calculus and other advanced topics), as this appears most relevant for preparing students to study engineering, the sciences, etc., later.

To my limited knowledge, the only educational system where speedy arithmetic is widely taught is in Japan, where children learn from a young age the use of the abacus in performing numerical calculations, gradually gaining proficiency. By their teenage years, good students are able to visualize an abacus mentally and use this mental image to perform their calculations (much as some skilled chess players are able to visualize an entire chess-board with pieces and reason/play using it), so the process of their calculation is entirely mental and does not rely on any outside device. Some other countries and educators have tried to copy this Japanese model of training, but with little notable success.
