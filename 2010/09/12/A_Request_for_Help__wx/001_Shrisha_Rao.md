\> Pranams to all scholars!  
\> Here is a request to you all. If you know about any persons who are working for the propagation of Vedic Mathematics Text of Sri Jagadguru Swami Sri Bharati Krishna Tirthaji in your respective regions or in any other region known to you, please mail me the details of either thier email IDs or phone numbers with or without thier postal addresses.

I don't think such efforts exist, and have my doubts about whether such an effort would make sense at all, if our objective is to train students to achieve mathematical maturity of understanding.

"At the same time, over a hundred leading scientists and mathematicians led by S. G. Dani, Professor of Mathematics at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research in Mumbai, signed a statement in protest against the efforts to include ‘Vedic mathematics’ in the school curriculum. Entitled ‘Neither Vedic Nor Mathematics’, it points out that the idea of ‘Vedic mathematics’ comes from a book by a swami (religious teacher) published posthumously in 1965 and containing ‘a set of tricks in elementary arithmetic and algebra to be applied in performing computations with numbers and polynomials’, written in the form of cryptic Sanskrit aphorisms (true ancient Indian mathematics, they note, was anything but cryptic). There is no connection with the Vedas, and virtually no mathematical usefulness in these aphorisms."

This is all part of an extended anti-Hindutva diatribe at <http://indology.wordpress.com/> -- but perhaps some हंस-क्षीर-न्याय is in order. The recent "Vedic mathematics" (as opposed to the Bhakshali manuscript, the शुल्बसूत्रs, the works of the ancient Indian mathematicians, etc.) is hardly an achievement in mathematics, numerical computation, or mathematical pedagogy, and I have yet to meet a mathematician who thinks otherwise.
