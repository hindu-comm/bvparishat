Namaste.  
  
I thought this is an appropriate time to share this piece of information.  
  
Maharshi Sandipani Rashtriya Veda Vidya Pratishtan had organised a National Workshop on Vedic Mathematics in 1988 March, at the University of Jaipur, and the proceedings have been published by the Pratishthan in association with Motilal Banarasidass in 1991.  
  
It has an article by K S Shukla 'Vedic Mathematics -- The Deceptive Title of Swamiji's book' -- for those who would like to know why some group is reluctant to call it Vedic Mathematics.  
  
In a society where people spend a lot to teach a child master Abacus, there are equally good chances of promoting Vedic mathematics, leaving aside the issue whether it is Vedic or not and whether it is mathematics or not. Some twenty-five years back, I had taught Vedic Mathematics to young students, and students enjoyed learning these skills.  
  
However, at the same time, the serious researchers would hardly like to spend any time on this, and would be more interested in re-searching what our ancestors knew.  
  
with regards,
