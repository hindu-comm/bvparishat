sabhAyai nama:



Being a learner, I had much trouble, in fact it took me half a day to learn and pronounce the following shloka clearly.



तदुपगतसमाससन्धियोगं सममधुरोपनतार्थवाक्यबद्धम् ।  
रघुवरचरितं मुनिप्रणीतं दशशिरसश्च वधं निशामयध्वम् \|\|



I am mesmerized by the way the shabda are arranged and so tongue twisting for me. Could you give me the details like what metre is this… Is there any similar shloka in this metre. Just curious.



Srikanth.
