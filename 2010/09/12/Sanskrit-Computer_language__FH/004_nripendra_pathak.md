respected sir,  
thanks for your remarks.  
I am trying to write point-wise answer. hope this will make a clear picture of my thought.  
  
1. its 100% true that all programming languages are artificial language. in computer, coding and decoding happens. instructions for computing is given through codes of programming language only. codes are written in artificial language. that's why programming languages are artificial language.  
but it can not be a right conclusion that artificial language is programming language.( when army says alpha to delta... alpha to delta, this is also a code, or you can say it artificial language. but it can not be a programming language.)  
  
2. if any programmer write codes in java programming language, same code will be used for a particular function in java (all over the world), so its a uniform language.  
  
3. I wrote this line for Sanskrit language.  
  
4. natural language: which is spoken by human.  
 all natural languages: world-wide we find thousands of languages. so I wrote "all natural languages".  
 other languages: I wrote this in the context of machine translation. (I wrote:... machine can understand all natural language and translate it in other languages.) here I accept my mistake in writing and correct my statement.  
                      here machine will translate any Natural language to other Natural language only.(Natural was missing in between other languages). for machine translation, one language
source language and other is target language. both are natural language.  
  
5. for any function, computer understands everything in binary digits.(i.e. 0 1). without understanding there is No Function.  
  
6. yes, its TRANSLATION, not conversion.because it takes lexical meaning from dictionary and follows the Syntax. i. e. ram eats a mango= raam aam khaataa hai. (not like this:- raam khaataa hai ek aam.)  
  
7. if I don't understand tamil, its a barrier of language for me. I can't understand any information written in tamil.  
this much was my understanding.  
  
I will welcome your remarks on this answer.
