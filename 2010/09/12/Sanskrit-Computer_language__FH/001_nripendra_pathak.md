As we know that language of computer is artificial language (c c++ java etc). it cant tolerate errors. same as Sanskrit is also a well structured language having a well defined grammar. so Sanskrit is a uniform language like any programing language. basically we are implementing Paninian Grammatical Framework for Natural Language Processing so that machine can understand all natural language and translate it in other languages so that the knowledge can be accessed without any barrier of language. that is why it is called "Sanskrit is suitable for Computer".
