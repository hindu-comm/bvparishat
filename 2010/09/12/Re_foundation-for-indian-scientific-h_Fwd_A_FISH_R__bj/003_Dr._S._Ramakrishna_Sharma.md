Namo vidvadbhyah,  
  
Our **shabdakoshas**(not arthakoshas!, though there are some **anarthakoshas** in lighter vain) are not 'coffins of dead words'( yea, :) the Dictionaries are!) because the very sounds/words have life and
are culture born and borne by cultured minds.  
  
Translation is warranted only when one cannot think in a given language which is alien to one's culture. What an irony is this that a Bharateeya blessed with multilingual opportunities has to hang on to **"English to Indian Languages and vise versa Dictionaries"!**  
  
Perhaps a colonial hang over!
