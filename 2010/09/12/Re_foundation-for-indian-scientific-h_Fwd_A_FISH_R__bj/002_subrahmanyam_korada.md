 Sorry , there was some technical problem and some material was lost .

  **VyAkaranam is not Grammar** and it is a **rough** (without claim to accuracy) **translation** . **VyAkaranam includes Grammar but not vice versa . Here Language is associated with Philosophy .  
**  
 **VyAkriyante = apasabdebhyah sAdhusabdAh prthakkriyante anena iti VyAkaranam (karane lyut**) .  
  
The term **'Sabda**' is used to denote the following meanings - **varnah, prakrtih, pratyayah, padam, vAkyam, avAntaravakyam, mahavAkyam, parA, pasyantI, madhyamA ( sphotah), vaikhary, dhvanih, sabdapramAnam, kAvyam, dhAtuh ( dhAturvai sabdah - Mahabhasyam**) etc. .  
  
So many meanings cannot be carried by **'Word**' ( although we put
'w' in capital) and therefore  
one hs to adapt the term rather than try for rendering .  
  
For **'pApam**' there is **'sin'** but for **'punyam**' (although it is available in all cultures) there is no  
equivalent word . **'Merit' is confusing** .  
  
There should be more entries in English Dictionaries .
