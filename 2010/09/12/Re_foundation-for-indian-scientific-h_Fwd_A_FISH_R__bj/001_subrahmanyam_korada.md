Really ,'SraddhA' - is a term that is pregnant with meaning - srat = satyam dhIyate asyAm iti sraddhA ,  
and therefore it is untranslatable .  
  
In fact, most af the terms in Indian culture , which are flavored with are Philosophy are untranslatable and  
have to be adapted . Some explanation in parenthesis / footnotes / endnotes ha to be provided .  
  
'Dharma' is not Religion , because back translation , i.e. religion = matam = istam (to a groupof people),  
fails . Satyam vada etc. are universals , i.e.common to all human beings . Dhriyate aneneti , dhAranAt  
etc. cannot be carried by righteousness , duty
