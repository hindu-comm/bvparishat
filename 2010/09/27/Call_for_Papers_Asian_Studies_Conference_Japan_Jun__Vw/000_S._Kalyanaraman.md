The Executive Committee of the Asian Studies Conference Japan (ASCJ)  
invites proposals for panels, roundtables, and individual papers to bepresented at the Fifteenth Asian Studies Conference Japan, to be held atInternational Christian University,Tokyo,on SaturdayandSunday, June  
25-26,  
2011.  
  
The deadline for proposals isNovember 15, 2010.  
You will hear if your proposal has been successful before the endof December.  
  
The online forms now available on the ASCJ website set out therequirements for individual paper proposals, panel proposals, androundtable proposals.  
[http://www.meijigakuin.ac.jp/\~ascj/](http://www.meijigakuin.ac.jp/~ascj/)  
  
Panels are proposed by individual scholars around a common subject. Panelsare composed of three or fourpaper presentersand one or morediscussants. Panel proposals should include a 250 word (maximum)  
abstract from each participant as well as a 250 word (maximum)statement that explains the session as a whole.  
  
Roundtables offer an opportunity for participants to discuss aspecific theme, issue or significant recent publication. A maximum of sixactive participants is recommended. While a roundtable proposal will not  
be as detailed as a panel proposal, it should explain fully the purpose,themes or issues, and scope of the session.  
Individual papers give scholars an opportunity to participate in theconference even if they are not able to put together a complete panel.  
  
Since only a limited number of individual papers can be accommodated,preference will be given to junior scholars. Your paper has a betterchance of acceptance as part of a panel. Paper proposals should  
include a 250 word (maximum) abstract.  
  
Please note that no person can appear on the program more than once. Theone exception is the doubling up of roles within a given panel(organizer/chair for example, or organizer/presenter).  
  
The Executive Committee encourages members to submit proposals that, byfocusing on more than one region or by drawing on more than onediscipline, will attract a broad range of scholarly interest.  
Suggestions for innovative alternatives to the panels, individualpapers and roundtables described above are also encouraged.  
  
We often hear from individuals who would like to form a panel, but areshort of one or two presenters.
