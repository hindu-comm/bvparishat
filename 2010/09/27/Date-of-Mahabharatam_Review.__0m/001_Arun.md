There was no doubt about date of Mahabharata in any of the 30  
available books on Indian astronomy or in Rajatarangini-Buhler had  
done a manipulation about Laukika era in that which did not fit in  
context. Even Al-Biruni and Abul fazal were clear about Yudhishthira  
Shaka. Confusion has been created only in British era. Persons are  
creating new dates just to show their research. Sri Narahari Achara  
has applied Eclipse data-but there is no reference of 3 eclipses in  
Mahabharata war. It started on Amavasya and there could be solar  
eclipse only after 1 month-not on date of killing Jayadratha. He has  
fitted the data of Mahabharata year 36 years after Kali instead of 36  
years before that. It will approximately fit as eclipse cycle is  
almost repeated after 18 years 10.5 days. half cycle has been stated  
by Vishvamitra in Rigveda of 3339 Tithis. Even NASA formula has huge  
errors for 3100 BC and it recommends that these should be corrected by  
historic data. It does not say that historic dates should be changed  
to suit the formula-Mahabharata in 36 years before Kali should not be  
shifted 36 years after Kali. THe same book which published Sri Achar  
work, also contradicted his logic. 5 inscriptions of Janamejaya after  
Sarpayaga in 3014 BC refer to solar eclipses and give dates in all 5  
ways. That is in Yudhisthira Jayabhyudaya Shaka 89 year-which  
corresponds to 29th year of Janamejaya rule after 60 yrears of  
Parikshita. Extract of janamejay inscriptions may be seen on website
