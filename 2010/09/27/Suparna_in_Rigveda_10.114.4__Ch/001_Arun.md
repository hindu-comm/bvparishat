There is an excellant book 'Suparna' by Sri E. Anantacharya, published  
by his son late Dr. E.Vedavyasa from his institute Vedavyasabharati,  
Hyderabad. However, there are a lot of printing mistakes in english  
transliteration of vedic verses. Sri R.L Kashyapa has mostly explained  
from adhyatmic angle and has done complete work on Rik and Taittiriya  
samhitas. I have added just one fact in this sukta. It relates to  
ancient history and geography of coastal India-as Suparna had entered  
the ocean-Arun
