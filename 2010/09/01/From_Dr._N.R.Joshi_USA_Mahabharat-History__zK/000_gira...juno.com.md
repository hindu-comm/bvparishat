Respected Scholars, Namaste!

There is misunderstanding about my posting on Mahabharat on this list recently.

\<"The SabhAparvan" edited by Franklin Edgerton (Poona, 1944 BORI). In the description of different countries  
(2.28.49), there comes "Antaakheem caiva Romaan ca yavanaanaam puram tathaa".  
The author claims that Antaakhee is city of Antioch established by Selucas Nikator in  
Turkey around 350 BC and Romaa was the city of Roma, Italy. Conclusion; Mahabharat cannot  
have been composed any time before the first century BC. Thanks. N.R.Joshi>

These are views of Dr. Edgerton. These are not my views. I posted to find out whether any scholar on this list is familiar with that verse from Mahabharat? Are these two words "Antakhi and Romaa are there in the verse from Sabhaparva? If they are there, do they mean different from the meanings given by Edgerton?

My views on Mahabharat were expressed on this list before in 2009-10. I am interested in collecting archaeological evidence of Mahabharat from outside of the subcontinent. I repeatedly ask question, when Mahabharat war was taking place (wherever you think), who were the immediate neighbors of the subcontinent? The reason for this question is the names of the main dynasties of Mahabharat-Kuru and Kamboja-are found outside of the subcontinent in the known history (between 500-300 BC).Archaeological evidence of Ladies, Kind dom descibed in Mahabharat is found in Sinkiang province of China.

I am familiar with efforts of researcher who use astronomical data from Mahabharat (Dr. Narahari Achar-I know) to decide the date of Mahabharat. These efforts do not explain why do we find names of Mahabharat nations outside of the subcontinent. If one says Arjun conquered the whole world and one is happy about it, then one is free to do so. If somebody believes Bharat meant the whole world at the time of Mahabharat, then he is free to enjoy that belief. But if somebody is trying to connect evidence from outside of the subcontinent there is nothing wrong in it. If some scholars from within the subcontinent have complementary information, I am looking for it, not the patriotic outbursts. Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
