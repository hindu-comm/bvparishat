Dear Jagannath,

  

Thanks for the completion of the Shloka. I got it from a text Dasabodha ascribed to Samartha Ramadasa composed of in both Marathi and Sanskrit verses.

  

Sorry for the typographical mistake for तत्त्वचिन्तानुवादः.

  

It may or may not be the ultimate source. There may be some other Sanskrit Source possibly which is not available on the net.

  

With regards


