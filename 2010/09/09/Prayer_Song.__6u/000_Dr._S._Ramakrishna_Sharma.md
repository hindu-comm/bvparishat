Respected Members,  
  
The file attached is the Prayer Song, selected lines in translation  
from Gurudev Tagore's "Gitanjali".(Where the mind is free...)  
The music direction is inspired by me. Hamsadhvani Raga  
and the rhythm suit well as I heard the song "played" by and in  
my mind.It is sung by 5 girl-students who have classical music training.  
  
Your comments are welcome. Hope that the file opens without any problem.
