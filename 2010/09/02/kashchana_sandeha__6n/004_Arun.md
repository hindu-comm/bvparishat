I am only giving meanings as per usage. Derivation by gammar should be  
parallel to it. Normally Ahar means day as used in Gita the Ahar of  
Brahma ic creation of world from abstract. Night is its dissolution  
back into abstract. In human life, it relates to daily cycle. Ahar  
means day and ratri is night. But in general Ahar meanssum of both and  
ahargana means number of days (day-nights) since a particular time.  
Aho-ratra is shortened to 'Hora' which means half part of a rashi.  
Opposit to it ahar in space should mean double.  
त्रिंशद्धाम वि-राजति वाक् पतङ्गाय धीमहि । प्रति वस्तोरहद्युभिः ॥  
(ऋक्, १०/१८९/३)  
For 30 Dhāma brightness is more, which is understood as Vāk =field of  
Patanga =sun. Each Vasta (location) of Dyu (sky) is measured in Ahar.  
Ahar and vasta both mean day.  
Dhāma and yojana both words have been used in Řgveda (1/123/8) for  
measure of Uşā (twilight)  
सदृशीरद्य सदृशीरिदु श्वो दीर्घं सचन्ते वरुणस्य धाम ।  
अनवद्यास्त्रिंशतं योजनान्येकैका क्रतुं परियन्ति सद्यः ॥ (ऋक्, १/१२३/८)  
They (Uşā) are same today and will be same tomorrow. They spread  
towards place of Varuņa, one by one. Dhāma of Varuņa are 30 without  
break. They are ahead of Kratu =sun by 30 Yojanas  
Meaning in space-Zone of Varuņa is galaxy. Within that, there are 30  
zones one after other where light of sun is more than the background  
of galaxy. Light of each zone is more than darkness and less Sun  
itself and is called Uşā (twilight) of 30 levels in 30 zones called  
Dhāma. Measure of Dhāma here is not defined. Here measuring rod is  
earth itself as in Sūrya-siddhānta-  
मा छन्दः तत् पृथिवी, अग्निर्देवता .. (मैत्रायणी संहिता, २/१४/९३, काठक  
संहिता, ३९/३९)  
Measure of loka has started in Taittirīya upanişad (2/8) from Earth-  
called Manuşya-loka. Bŗhadāraņyaka upanişad (3/3/2)-  
...द्वात्रिংशतं वै देवरथाह्न्यन्ययं लोकस्तং समन्तं पृथिवी  
द्विस्तावत्पर्येति ताং समन्तं पृथिवीं द्विस्तावत्समुद्रः पर्येति.....  
(बृहदारण्यक उपनिषद् ३/३/२)  
= 32 ahar (Plural is aha̅ni) is measure of Deva-ratha, its double in  
all directions is Pŗthivī (enclosure of solar system), that is  
surrounded all around by Samudra (ocean) of twice size.  
Thus all measure starts from earth as measuring rod. But there are 3  
Dhāmas within earth, so Dhāma 3 = earth. Distance from center of  
measure is equal to radius of earth.  
Radius of Dhāma 4 =2 x earth radius, Radius of Dhāma 5 = 4 x earth  
radius, and so on.
