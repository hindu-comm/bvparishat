Subject: Re: {भारतीयविद्वत्परिषत्} Is there any possibility of occurrence of halant after vowel or vowel sign  
In my opinion, they are specific letters to Malayalam and could not be compared to Sanskrit. These letters are noted as "Adhikaakshara" for Malayalam language, by the writer of Lilatilaka, and has nothing to do do with Sanskrit halant forms. Cil is a special case in Nambudri pronuncitation, just when they recite "gayatri" pracodayaat will be pronounced as "pracodayaal". These are in fact, "samvruta" ukaara, as in Hindi it is "a" is pronounced. The same case with "ukara" if I am correct in my memory of reading "Keralapaniniyam" a treatise on Malayalam grammar like the rule "Kharanunastikaatiprasara" another speciality of Malayalam language. In hindi, it is only "a" pronounced "samvruta" as as it is substituted with VivRuta by the last Sutra of Ashtadhyayi. Hence there was not any necessity to invent a orthographical sign. Since they were considered as "Adhikakshara" only the adhika-letters representing them are provided. In the revised fonts used for printing, to be clear to non-speakers also read correctly or advantage without using specially designed fonts, they had used such halant-like simbols. Software fonts also take it granted for creating special fonts. Also there was a movement write as you hear it. It may also be an influence.

  

But in older printed books you will see separate letters for them without using the halant signs.  

  

This simply orthographic conventions but evidently in the earlier times there were no such use of "candrakala" according to Gundert. Both linguists of last century called it as saMvRuta ukaara. While other linguists may hold that it is half u-kara. In the words of Kerala Panini, they are called shorter "u" "hrasvatara" the Gunderts rules of phonetic change and writing system kept in tact.

The problem is with "N" is a different one. It is like the Tamil, has two difference phonemes, but with without two distinct orthography for each. Only Malayalam native speaker can use them without erring. The general rule is like the Tamil, which uses still two different characters :

  

நான்

  

It is the same justification for the others also as noted by Gundert:

  

[Malayalam Vowels](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malayalam#Vowels)

  

They were written with simple U sign itself as I have noted above. Only the conventions can be known by native speakers correctly.

  

It is preferable that morphological and orthographic discussions could be separately discussed.

  

I will get back after some time with more details from Kerala Panini. Or you can yourself search the relavent section in the online Kerala Panini which in in Malayalam:
