It is not negative-it is dishonesty and slave minds. Sole learning of  
Ramvilasa Sharma and D. N. Jha is that Rishis ate meat only specially  
beef. For that they have been honoured as experts on history. The same  
group contered ASI report in Ayodhya matter that animal bones were  
fond at Rama mandir site. It can not be temple as Hindus do not eat  
meat.  
Meat eating has not been prohibited, there are 3 chapters in Charaka  
samhita on that. But it has been called Tamasika and not proper for a  
sage. Actually it is strictly prohibite in Bible (Genesis 1/27) and  
Korana (Chapter 2-Al bakar -over 6 paragraphs). In Turkey, Al Bakar  
has been translated as 'Cow' and bakrid means worship of cow.  
Destroying or even interfering with temples of other religions have  
been strictly prohibited in same chapter. It is also proudly written  
and lectured by Muslim scholars that Islam means peace and there were  
120,000 prophets in world including Rama and Krishna. But in practice  
all temples were desecreted first by blood of cow and idols were  
broken-these details and rules have been stated while destroying  
temples at Kullu, Mathura etc. Koran is rightly respected as holy, but  
invadors have done just opposit to that.  
By no stretch of imagination, Babur can be called Indian. He was  
invader from Faraghna. If his right is accepted, then concept of  
nation or any personal property will vanish. Whatever is captured by  
an invador, it will become his property. If any dacoit kills two  
persons and loot, his murder is honourable act and I can not take back  
any stolen property. What case can be done for thefts, robberies?  
Changez Khan, Timur Lang-all invadors were treated as foreign invadors  
even by muslim kings. Even Babur was treated as foreign invadors and  
he was pposed by Ibrahim Lodhi. Then his son Humayun was expelled by  
Shershah Suri. After death of Shershaha, his son Hakim Khan fought on  
side of Hemachandra and then became one of commanders of Rana Pratap.  
Only then, Akbar started attempts to become Indian with help of kings  
of jaipur etc. He copied Vikramaditya by keeping 9 Ratnas-British  
historians omitted his name. Abul Fazal gave matching dates of  
Yudhisthira shaka in Dina elahi calender-after accurate calculation by  
Vakyakaranas based on Kali era for 2000 years-doubts are being created  
about its origin. Akbar has been dubbed as illiterate, but he knew  
about 2 types f calenders-Amali and Fasali. No historian of British  
era including historians of astronomy have ever heard about difference  
between Shaka and samvatsara. What should be their grade compared to  
Akbar?-Arun
