*Septgember 30, 2010*



Regardless of the true meaning and significance of the court ruling on the Ayodhya dispute, one point is clear. It is a well deserved slap in the face of Romila Thapar, R.S. Sharma and their ilk arguing there was no temple at the site.



They will now try to go into hiding but they should be brought before the public and exposed as charlatans. They have been shown as double falsifiers-- the Aryan invasion and now the Ayodhya fiasco.



Koenraad Elst wrote in his *Negationism in India* when the truth comes out these Negationists will not be able to show their faces in public. Let us make sure that this happens by not letting the the public forget treacherous role played by these charlatans and Quislings.



Their imposture and false assurances was responsible for much of the Muslim intransigence and the bloodshed. These'eminent historians'have innocent blood on their hands.
