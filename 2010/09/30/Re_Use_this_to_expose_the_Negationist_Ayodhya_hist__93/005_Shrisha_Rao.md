Actually, there is scope for a more thorough discussion of the worldwide shortcomings of Marxism as a governing philosophy for scholarship. Even if we give Romila Thapar, etc., a bye on their record over Ayodhya and related matters, there is no denying that left-wing scholarship has done much harm everywhere. In most places in the world Marxism is thoroughly discredited in academic circles and it is no longer fashionable for a scholar to be called a Marxist, but it is simply amazing that much scholarship in India still has such a slant.

Marxists also have had a tendency to compromise on their idealogy when it suited a perceived interest, but are willing to go to any lengths (even at the cost of millions of lives) in dogmatic persistence in their ideology when it does not cost anything to their own powerful elite. The best example of this is the erstwhile Soviet Union's long and powerful support to the fraud Trofim Lysenko, who discarded scientific and long-standing principles of agriculture in favor of Marxist theory, resulting in large famines where millions died. Lysenkoism had the same effect in China under Mao later, during the Great Leap Forward.

However, the Soviet Union's nuclear program was led by genuine scientists of international repute like Igor Kurchatov, not charlatans like Lysenko. Kurchatov was asked by Stalin's right-hand man Beria if it was not true that quantum theory and relativity are in conflict with Marxism; Kurchatov bluntly replied that if relativity and quantum mechanics were rejected, the Bomb would have to be rejected too. Stalin wanted nuclear weapons, so there was no witch hunt against physicists, and Kurchatov and his team were given huge raises and creature comforts well exceeding the average for that society (though Stalin was elsewhere adamantly opposed to financial and other incentives for performance, calling them bourgeois). If the agricultural scientists who suffered persecution under Stalin and Mao had been able to offer their bosses a bomb, rather than just food for millions of people the bosses did not care about, they would doubtless have enjoyed the same.
