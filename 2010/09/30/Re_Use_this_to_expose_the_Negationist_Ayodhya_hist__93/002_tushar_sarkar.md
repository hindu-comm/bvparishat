Dear Dr. Sadasivamurthy,  
 I cannot but share your feelings about our Indian-born Marxist historians &what they have done. However, itistoo optimistic to expect that the 'charlatans' would ever 'try to go into hiding' due to shame. They are'mahapurushas' who have transcended the earthly botherations viz., shame,intellectual honesty,self-criticism etc., through their kind of 'yogasaadhanaa' called *inauthenticity*.  
Oh! By the way-- I read your mail with attachment on 'Our Hist. is Written in England'.It is excellent & should be an eye opener to many.Later, I will contact you again regarding "juvenile Punishment" in Indian perspective. Thanks.  

Tushar Sarkar.
