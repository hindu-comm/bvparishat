Respected Scholars,  
  
Namaste. A famous line of a verse from Gita reads - कर्मणैव हि संसिद्धिम् आस्थिता जनकादयः (3.20) ।  
Has the king of Mithila, Janaka, referred here? Also it is heard as there are sixty four  
Janakas. Is it true like the rotation of Indra, the king of divine bodies?  
  
Thanks&Regards,  
Prasad
