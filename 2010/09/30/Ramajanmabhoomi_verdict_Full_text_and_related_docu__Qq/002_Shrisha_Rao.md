It is unfortunate that many scholars religious gurus continue to use this terminology “Lord” in their scholarly presentations. Now judges have joined them as well !?

This is a vexed issue, and exists whenever an English word (from the Anglo-Saxon or Judeo-Christian cultural/linguistic/religious traditions) is used in place of a traditional Sanskrit one. For instance, just as we would prefer that भगवान् (a word that has no literal equivalent in English, as was discussed here last year) be used rather than "Lord," there are some who note that "idol" is really quite a negative word, used to describe objects held to be sacred by pagans and others, but whose worship is regarded as vile and blasphemous in the Judeo-Christian traditions. The word used to describe truly sacred objects is "icon," and some have suggested that this is a better equivalent for प्रतिमा. Similarly, some say that use of words like "pontiff" is inappropriate in the Indian context.
