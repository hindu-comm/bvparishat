sivAste panthAnassantu sadasiva !

This is a good attempt and there will be full ocoperation , I rather hope , from all scholars . I will do my best .

Blindly following / aping the West caused a collossal loss to our
culture and heritage . People have been suffering from inferioty complex .

How come no historian bothered to learn Sanskrit before he ventured upon the task of compiling History ?

How come nobody in the group bothered about Mahabhasyam, Manusmrti , amarakosa etc. while discussing and deciding Aryas . This is a clear case of cultural vendetta and hatred .



Many Vedic scholars were taken away by Germans from some villages of East Godavari Dt and later on the pretext of reaching them to their native places the Mlecchas killed the scholars and threw

the bodies into ocean . Even during World War II their families were receiving money from Germany .



"caritraam sikseran...' - Manusmrti .
