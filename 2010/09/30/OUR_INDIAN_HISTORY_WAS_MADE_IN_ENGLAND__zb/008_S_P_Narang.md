History should be rewritten on the basis of the new facts and figures available and the methodology should be historical and not political or biased for a particular sect/community/ideology. Why Sanskritists who are talking so much against the existing history can supercede the earlier histories on the basis of their original sources? Many of the earlier historians do not go the original sources which are available to sanskrits. I know the earlier great historians who had been running after the students of Sanskrit with less knowledge of history. It should not be an individual but a joint project and pooling of the information. Regards, spnarang
