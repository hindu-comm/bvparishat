Caritra is used for the actions of day to day life making a total personality. That is why it has become a synonym of character. ( svam svam caritram sikseran) Whereas carita is used in the historical or semi-historical personality. Carita is a full literature ( For example: Vikramankadevacarita, Ramapalacarita ) particularly amongst Jainas along with prabandhas e.g.Trisastisalakapurusacarita, Prabhavakacarita, and Kumarapalaprabandh.
