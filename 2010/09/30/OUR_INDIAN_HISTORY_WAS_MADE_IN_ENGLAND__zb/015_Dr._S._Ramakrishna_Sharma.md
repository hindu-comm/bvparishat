नम: संप्रदायकर्तृभ्यो परमऋषिभ्य:,

  
\>Please post the Kannada versionमहासंकल्प:of महर्षि देवल:  
Someone can transliterate it into Devanagari also. Let us make it the preface  
of Bharatam Janam Itihaasa or Charitra and a dedication toमहर्षि देवल:  
  

Thanks for those encouraging and enthusing words.  
  
The attached PDF is created out of the scanned pages from ऋग्वेदप्रयोगदीपिका (श्री नृसिंह पारिजात आश्वलायनपूर्वप्रयोग:)pp.238-46,Kannada Edition, 4th Reprint.(2001.)  
Compared to another text with Kannada annotations, the number of pages are less in this volume due to the size of the fonts. Hence this is chosen.  
Often a संक्षेपversion is found in the case of such contents/portions. This version sometimes becomes  
more popular due to being less voluminous. And unfortunately the original detailed version disappears from  
the books and memory. Hence I have given both versions as available in the text selected for scanning.  
  
Esteemed scholars who possess a copy of Devala Smriti may tally the content in the PDF.  
Transliteration may be taken up if this is found useful.  
धन्यो'स्मि।
