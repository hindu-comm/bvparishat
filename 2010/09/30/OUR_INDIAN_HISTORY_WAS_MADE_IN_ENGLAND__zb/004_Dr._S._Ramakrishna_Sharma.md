नम: परमऋषिभ्यो नम: परमऋषिभ्य:,  
चरितं and चरित्रं are not the same as "History". 'चरितं रघुनाथस्य '  
is not History of Raghunatha. "गुरुचरित्रं " is not History of Guru.  
There is tremendous degree of sanctity, sanity and sensibility  
in the two terms referred to here. Both texts are पुरुषार्थोपयोगी.  
  
Let me take the opportunity to mention about the महासंकल्प:  
of महर्षि देवल: । In a few pages(18/20) it takes one through a long  
pilgrimage across the time and space of Baratam. Names of all  
sacred groves, mountains, Shakti Peethas, trees, and many more  
are enlisted therein. It is not a mere reference record; it is a parAyaNa  
Text; preferably chanted by heart during important observances.  
(I have a copy in Kannada with extensive notes geographically locating  
the places, shrines and rivers etc.)  
  
Like the गुरुवम्शावली स्तोत्रं of Sringeri and many Kulavamshaavalii  
records, like the Family Tree given by the author of the text शाक्तप्रमोद:  
there are many Sanskrit resources which serve the purpose of sustaining  
the historical awareness while retaining the living link.  
BhArata Charitram ought to be a parAyaNa grantha in the sense that  
it will be पुरुषार्थोपयोगी.  
Can we hope to get the proposed work done in Sanskrit?
