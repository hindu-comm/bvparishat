I entirely agree with these views, though I use slightly different  
word. History was not made, it was destroyed which is voluminously  
written as lifelong aim of Maxmuller, introduction of Sanskrit English  
dictionary of Monier Williams and declared aim of Boden chair.  
Whatever may be bad aims of the British, they were not slaves and many  
times stated the truth. This is not possible for Indians with slave  
mentality who are more loyal than British destroyers of history. If  
anybody wants to do any honest research in history and archeology, he  
should see these points-  
(1) Aryan or Vedic civilization was not created in Indus valley nor it  
was limited there, as well proved by Kalyanaraman ji. Drying up of  
Saraswati can only end a civilization, not create it.  
(2) Without reading and deciphering any letter or symbols, how British  
masters and their Indian slaves are so sure of conclusions? The same  
authors do not trust a single line of Bhagavata or Mahabharata whose  
meaning is very clearly understood.  
(2) They tell that Indians did not write history and start it with  
Megasthenes whose works have not been found and quotations have been  
collected by persons who cannot be called honest by any stretch of  
imagination. Still, not a single line of Megasthenes is trusted by  
them and each point has been reversed-  
(a) India is only country where all people are indiginous-conclusion  
is made that all Indians have come from outside like the British and  
only for that puropose excavation was one in Indus valley whose  
conclusions wetre pre-decided.  
(b) India had not attacked any country in last 15,000 years, i.e.  
after 15,500 BC. This refers to invasion on Krauncha dvipa by  
Karttikeya in 15800 BC as per Mahabharta Vana parva 230/8-10). There  
can be error ofabout 50 years in the estimate, but withous any thought  
or calculation it was changed to 1500 BC by Maxmuller as start of  
Vedic civilization. After this copy and manipulation, Maccrindal  
removed this number and replaced it by 'never'. Till today, no proof  
has been given for that manipulation, but any sentence by white  
masters has to be obeyed blindly and all corrections and logics are  
fought bitterly by loyalists.  
(c) Megasthenes has indicated first Greek attack in April 6777 BC by  
Dionysus or Bacchus. After 154 generation of Indian kings, Alexander  
attacked in 326 BC. 154 generations from king Bahu killed in Yavana  
attack ends with Chandragupta -1 of Gupta empire.  
(d) R.C. Mazumdar in his Ancient India, page 135 quotes Pliny and  
Megasthenes to give strength of army of Andhra kings. That is possible  
only if he comes after that in Gupta period. It must have been obvious  
to all, so he had to wite another book helped by his friends K.K.  
Dutta and H.C. Raychoudhary-just to omit this fact. how such persons  
can be relied on ? However, the information was picked up by Usmania  
university in which same professor maintains 2 versions. For glory of  
Andhra, he assumes Megasthenes in Gupta period and quotes Pliny and  
Mazumdar. For history texts, he keeps him in Maurya period.  
(e) Megasthenes also indicates 2 periods of democracy 120 years and  
then 300 years in near past. Earlier period is 21 republics of  
Parashurama after which Kalamba era started from 6177 BC. He has been  
indicated 15 generations after Dionysus which matches. Second period  
is Malava-gana whose history has been totally avoided as kings of  
Malava were starters of calender, as Ujjain falls in that region. It  
started with Shudraka (756 BC) till Sriharsha (456 BC). It is fine  
example of Indian independence that after reading their books for  
whole life, same professors call them fictitious telling that there is  
no record about them.  
(f) Finally, it is stated that Megasthenes had come to the court of  
Chandragupta at Patna. He has stated that he was with Kshatrapa of  
Persia and only for 2 years, he had come to Palibothri on banks of  
Yamuna and with puillar of Hercules. He has also given its distance  
from Nyse town where he was living and has stated that Yamuna passed  
through Mathura after that. But there is no way that diffrence between  
Ganga and Yamuna can be explained to loyalists.  
(3) All British historians have copied geneology of Malava kings for  
describing Bhoja etc. For history of Rajsthan also, James Todd copied  
Shudraka shaka but reduced it by 31 years to confuse the matter and  
hide the source. He had to destroy all geneologies starting with surya  
and chandra vamsha to prove Rajput kings as descendents of foreign  
Hunas and Shakas. This gana was needed to protect India from attack of  
Asuras in west Asia. That is possible only when they themselves were  
powerful after 850 BC, not after they were destroed in 612 BC by  
Chahaman of Delhi and later overrun by Alexander.  
(4) Lewis Rice, Richard Temple, Cunningham-all Britishers have  
universally declared all inscriptions as fake and made to gain  
unlawful property and destroyed date parts of them. However, their  
Indian disciples tell that only inscriptions are reliable and not any  
purana or Bhagavata. There is some motive of false legal right by a  
person. That applies to kings also. But dates will be correct. Even  
now, more than 1 crore civil suites are pending-mostly false claims.  
However, Bhagavata and Mahabharata have not been disputed by any body  
in past 5100 years-that is their importance.  
(5) All basic inscriptions have been falsified. At site of Kalinga  
war, there is Hathi-gumpha inscription which does not tell about any  
war or Buddhism. But stories were created by Vincent Smith that 10.5  
lakhs were killed and injured in that war. He would have liked to keep  
it more than 35 lakhs killed by Ravenshaw in 1865 in Orissa by  
artificial famine, but was doubtful that total population of Kalinga  
was not that much. To prove all Hindus as murdurous like the British,  
he staed that Ashoka adopted Buddhism to shun violence. Only reference  
in Buddist texts is in chapter Ashokavadana of book Divyavadana which  
tells that after visctory over Kalinga Ashoka killed 12, 000 Jain  
monks. Is it a sign of non-violence? Buddhism was only sect in India  
in which even monks are permitted to eat meat daily. Devadatta was  
expelled from Sangha solely for demanding that monks should be  
vegetarian. Buddha himself had to be operated by Jivaka due to excess  
meat eating and finally died at Saranatha due to meat eating only,  
though prohibited by Jivaka. Details are in Buddha-charita of  
Ashvaghosha taught in all universities but not really read.  
(6) Any comment on astronomy is difficult even for learned professors  
of physics and math as it is a specialized subject. But persons  
emboldened with loyality freely comment about astronomical contents of  
vedas and puranas without even knowing basic school mathematics or  
knowing diffrence between Ganga and Yamuna-Arun
