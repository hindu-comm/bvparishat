 This is a pretty story but there are reasons to doubt its authenticity. To begin with Max Muller could not pronounce Sanskrit andwould not have read the Veda in public. He could neither speak Sanskrit nor understand spoken Sanskrit. This is the real reason he never visited India-- fear of exposure. Swami Dayananda Saraswati said of Max Muller: "He is like a toddler trying to walk."



 This is a matter of record admitted by Max Muller himself late in his life. (Please see my book *The Politics of History.*) He was never the Sanskrit scholar he has been made out be, but an astute politician who knew how to get patronage of the ruling powers. But he could get away with it because the standards in Europe then were quite low (still the case today). Again Dayananda said: "In a desert where no tree grows, every castor plant is an oak."



Is it any wonder that Max Muller avoided visiting India and face the Swami?



 Second, the coarse, tobacco-chewing Edison was not as culturally sensitive as the story suggests. He was an undoubted genius with little education like Michael Faraday, but without Faraday's humility.



 Most seriously, it is a matter of record that the first words recorded were the poem "Mary had a little lamb..." recited by Edison himself.



 If HMV did publish such a pamphlet, it was pure marketing gimmick. Also, did HMV exist at that time? I thought it was a post-disc phenomenon, while Edison made and marketed 'Edison cylinders'.



 Hold on to your fantasy by all means, but don't call it history.
