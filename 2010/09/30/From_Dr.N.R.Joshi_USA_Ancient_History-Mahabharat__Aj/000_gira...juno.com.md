Respected Scholars, Namaskar!

Good news-Inscriptions of Janamejaya

Dr. Arun in his September 27 posting, quoting  
"5 inscriptions of Janamejaya after Sarpayaga in 3014 BC refer to solar eclipses and give dates in all 5  
ways. That is in Yudhisthira Jayabhyudaya Shaka 89 year-which  
corresponds to 29th year of Janamejaya rule after 60 years of  
Parikshita. Extract of janamejay inscriptions may be seen on website  
[www.scribd.com/Arunupadhyay-Arun](http://www.scribd.com/Arunupadhyay-Arun)"

Dear Dr Arun, I looked into to www. [scribd.com/Arunupadhyay](http://scribd.com/Arunupadhyay). There are many postings. I did not know where to search your article on inscriptions of Janamejaya. For the benefit of me and of other members of this list, will you please kindly offer us the information-  
(1) Where were these inscriptions discovered? When? Who did excavation? In what language and script are these inscriptions? In what area of the subcontinent were they found? Are they on stone plates or metal plate or on the ancient structure? Are they printed in any book? If yes, please give us author, publisher, and year. Thanks.

If other scholars of this list read these Janamejaya inscriptions, please write here so that we grow in our knowledge together. Thanks.N.R.Joshi
