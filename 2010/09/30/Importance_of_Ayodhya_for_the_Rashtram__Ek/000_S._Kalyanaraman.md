Sri Rama is a personification of Hindu Rashtram. Ramo vigrahavaan dharmah, says Valmiki.(Rama is embodiment of dharma). This dharma, what Gautama called esha dhammo sanantano, is the foundation of the Rashtram.

  

Ayodhya is the locus of the cultural memory of the nation of Bharatam, what Rishi Vishwamitra called bharatam janam.विश्वामित्रस्य रक्षतिब्रह्मेदमभारतं जनम (RV 3.53.12) His prayer, his brahma shall protect the Bharata nation.
