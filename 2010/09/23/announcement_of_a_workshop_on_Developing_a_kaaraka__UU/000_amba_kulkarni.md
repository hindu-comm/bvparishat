One week Workshop on 'Developing a kaaraka analyser for Sanskrit'  

  
We are glad to announce a "One week Workshop on Developing a parser for  
Sanskrit" being organised jointly by the Center for Advanced Study in  
Sanskrit, University of Pune and the Department of Sanskrit Studies,  
University of Hyderabad.  
  
Dates: 1st Dec - 7th Dec 2010  
  
Venue: Center for Advanced Study in Sanskrit, University of Pune, Pune  
  
Organisers: Center for Advanced Study in Sanskrit, University of Pune, Pune  
 and  
 Department of Sanskrit Studies, University of Hyderabad, Hyderabad  
  
  
Aim of the Workshop:  
--------------------  
Shaabdabodha is the understanding that arises from a linguistic utterance. The  
three schools of Shaabdabodha viz. Vyaakarana, Nyaaya and Miimaamsaa mainly  
differ in the chief qualificand of the Shaabdabodha. Nevertheless to begin  
with, all these three schools need an analysis of an utterance. This analysis  
expresses the relations between different meaningful units involved in an  
utterance. Panini's grammar describes rules for synthesizing a sentence  
from the meaningful units. The process of analysis is inverse of synthesis  
and many a times involves dealing with ambiguities because of non-determinism.  
  
In this workshop, we look at the problem of analysis, and discuss the  
development of a kaaraka analyser for Sanskrit. We discuss how the Miimaamsaa  
constraint of aakaankshaa (expectancy) helps to rule out non-solutions and  
sannidhi (proximity) to prioritize the solutions.  
  
It is assumed that the participants have good knowledge of vyaakarana and  
are competent enough to analyse the Sanskrit sentences showing the kaaraka  
relations. The ongoing work on the development of the kaaraka analyser will  
be discussed and the participants will be encouraged to write new rules,  
understand and improve the existing rules, and debug the system when it  
gives a wrong analysis.  
  
 Topics to be covered  
 --------------------  
  
 a) Brief summary of Kaaraka relations  
 b) Steps involved in the analysis of a sentence: a computational perspective  
 c) Dynamics involved in the information coding in a language string  
 d) Kaaraka annotation scheme and hands-on on kaaraka tagging  
 e) Design of a parser guided by the dynamics of information coding  
 f) Introduction to the expert shell for writing the rules for sentential analysis  
 g) Understanding the existing Sanskrit parser and improving it further  
  
Eligibility: Any Sanskrit Teacher or a Sanskrit Research scholar or a Post  
Graduate Student of Sanskrit with good Vyakarana Background  
  
Number of Participants: 25  
  
Lodging and boarding will be provided in the University Guest House.
