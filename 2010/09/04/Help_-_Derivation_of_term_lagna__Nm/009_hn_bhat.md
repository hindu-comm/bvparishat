Thanks Dr. Subrahmanyam for your further further analysis of the words.

  

Yet, I am also interested in knowing how the words "Lagna" came to be used in the sense (may not right in the strictest sense native to Sanskrit) but in regional languages (at least I know it is used in Kannada, as you have noticed "Lagnapatrika" = the "patrika" containing the "Lagna" in which the "Vivaha" takes place and commonly misunderstood for the Vivaha-patrika = invitation for the Marriage, and became used synonymously as I guess only now on seeing the word by you). This was the doubt raised by the initiator of this issue also.

  

Any satisfactory explanation, for this? I do not know of the other languages.

  

Now coming to the "Lagna" the word of "Nipata type" without "it" in the sense "Sakta" in the quoted Sutra. I could not get the difference of meaning betwen "Lagitam" and "Lagnam" (=saktam), when we take the both forms from "Lage Sange" (again the same meaning = sakta and sanga derived from the same root as it happens to be). Can you explain the difference? I was expecting you earlier, but in your delay, somehow, I put in some information I can gather. I don't know whether this in accordance to the discussions in the Great commentaries. I got the same reply lagnam = saktam, kshubhitam = anyat. only in Kashika, Nyasa, Padamanjari, Siddhantakaumudi,

In Mahabhashya, also there is the difference explained:

  

Lagnam saktaabhidhaane; Lagnam saktaabhidhaane iti vaktavyam;

Lagitam saktena ity evaanyatra.

  

But there is no explanation for *sakta* as in the case for Mantha, and other words either in Kayyata or Nagesha. Nor any clue in Sekhara also.

  

None clearly mentioned what is this "anyat" meaning. Some suggest that it could be derived from Lasja, which is strongly rejected in his commentary on Bhanuji on Amarakosha.

  

Once again, thanking you for expertise opinions offered in the forum.

  

On the astrological aspect of the word, some more informations haverecentlyappeared since my last post.

  

With regards and thanks for all who have contributed to this interesting discussion.
