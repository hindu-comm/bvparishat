Sri Bhattacharya Mahodaya Namaste!  
I have no disagreement with your observations about the way 'lagna' is  
used or interpreted. Since the original query was about derivation I  
was trying to trace the earliest known use of the word in available  
Sanskrit texts. That is how I referred to VJ. The actual word there is  
'vilagna' meaning perhaps 'detachment'. About your last sentence I am  
not sure whether you meant just तारा and not ताराग्रह। किं चेत्  
ताराग्रहेति पदस्य तारान् गृण्हाति इति अर्थः ननु?  
As far as I know, this word is used to refer to planets, (पञ्च  
ताराग्रहाः) very aptly since planets can occult (captures, grasps,  
seizes) stars.  
The 27 equal divisions starting from the visible Dhanistha nakshatra  
on winter solstice day is what is described in the Vedanga Jyotisha.  
Probably before this system got formalized Vedic people recognized  
27/28 visible nakshatras (Krittikaadi vide Tai.Brahmana) to describe  
what is now called the ecliptic, the path along which sun is seen to  
move. The difficulty in arriving at a precise conclusion is due to  
the fact Krittika is not a single star but a group. In the  
nakshatreshti (and perhaps even in RV) these were originally counted  
as seven but later ekaagni text declares them to be only six.

Regards

RN Iyengar

But in case of udayalagna it will mean just the hour when the nakṣatra appears on the horizon. That will be a few seconds, a very short time. By the way, nakṣatra the 27 divisions of the space-globe each measuring 13o 20’ is different from star (tārāgraha).
