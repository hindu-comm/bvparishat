Dear Sir,

  

I am not conversant with the Jyotisha and other Shastra-s. Seeing other members silent, I put forward my understanding of the term to your query.

  

"राशीनामुदयो लग्नम्" मेषादिराशौ तत्तद्ग्रहानामुदयो लग्नमिति ज्यौतिषिकानां समयः\| It can be derived from two roots लगे संगे by the past participle suffix क्त and the form is included in   
  

And, about the derivation of a word and its usage in different contexts with different connotations, there is a simple saying in Mahabhashya:

  

Nobody asks the grammarian to produce the derive the words so that I can use it like people go and ask him "Create a pot so that we will use it.
It is the user who wants to use to pot for different purposes and the potter also makes it according to their needs.

  

It is the function of the Grammarian to offer the possible etymology for the words used for their forms and their meaning is determined by convention in the specific contexts. In many cases, they are used as they are derived and transference of meaning is possible like any other words in other language.

  

Here the form is exhibited in a Sutra as an exceptional case in the Sutra: "क्षुब्धस्वान्त ..." (७.२.१८) in the meaning सक्त come into contact. Exactly this is the meaning in the astronomical zodiacal digits 1/12 called Rashi. The time is also

  

"लग्नं राश्युदये क्लीबं सक्त-लज्जितयोस्त्रिषु" This explains the word as derived from the root लस्ज लज्जायाम् and its use in different senses. It is technically used in the astronomical and astrological context and treatises as defined by them. The time of contact of each planet "ग्रह" in the twelfth digits मेष etc. are called by लग्न as per the usage. And this is profusely used in Astrological works and in the case of Vivaha also the time auspicious called Muhurta is related with this लग्न It is called by the name the Rashi which the plannets are suitable for both the bride and bridegroom. Thus the term is related to Vivaha. Not only for Vivaha, in general the term is used in the astrological texts in the same sense. It may not be far removed from the meaning given by Panini, in the above rule and restricted in meaning to the movement of the planet into the Rashi in astrology. It is used in neuter gender in the technical sense and in other sense, as past participle it can be used as adjective also according to the lexicon Medini. राशि is again the 1/12 group of the 27 stars. I am not going to technical details and leave it to other scholars well-versed in astrology. If any erroneous information is found in the above, they are requested to please correct me.

  

This is how it became used in relation to Vivaha. But it is generally used in the same technical sense in literature also:

  

उच्चस्थे ग्रहपञ्चके सेन्दौ नवम्यां तिथौ

लग्ने कर्कटके पुनर्वसुयुते मेषं गते पूषणि।

निर्दग्धुं पलाशसमिधो मेध्यादयोध्यारणेः।

आविर्भूतमभूतपूर्वमपरं यत्किंचिदेकं महः।

  

This is the verse describing the birth of Rama in Champuramayana. So it is not exclusively related with Vivaha, but any auspicious Muhurta. In the above context, we can take it the rise of Karkataka rashi (in the horizon).

  

With regards
