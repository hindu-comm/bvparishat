\[I am not a 'jyotishi' in the contemporary sense of the term. My  
interest is in ancient astronomical concepts and models.\]. The word  
'Lagna' AFAIK appears in Lagadha's Vedanga Jyotisha (RVJ-19):  
श्रविष्टाभ्यो गुणाभ्यस्तात् प्राग्विलगग्नान विनिर्दिशेत् ।

The above refers to the risings of the star Dhanishtha, usually  
identified with beta-Delphini, in a yuga of five years. Kuppanna  
Shastri the editor and translator of VJ (INSA Edition)translates the  
word 'lagnaan' as Orient ecliptic points. Before the introduction of  
the concept 'Rashi' lagna meant the risings of a particular star. This  
was in the sense of 'attachment, stuck, pasted' since something or  
other will be rising in the east continuously. My guess is 'lagna' as  
a पारिभाषिकशब्द refers to a precise moment but since this can not be  
used in practice 'lagna' started meaning an interval. We find the word  
'लग्नं' in the Gurvashtakam in the sense of attachment:

गुरोरन्घ्रिपद्मे मनश्चेन्न लग्नं ततःकिं ततःकिं ततःकिं ततःकिं।।

The use of the word 'lagna' in the sense of marriage is just a  
देशाचार।

\> The following is a common sense explanation how lagna can mean a range of time.  
\> The usual meaning of lagna is ‘attached’ as in kaṇṭhalagna, pṛṣṭhe lagnaḥ. In astrology/astronomy it means ‘attachment of the moon’ that is its attachment to a particular position. Since the position is valid for some time, the range of time too is called lagna.  
\> Since the lagna is mostly determined with reference to marriage -- the range of time within which the marriage is to take place -- the word is used also to mean marriage itself in some regions. In Bengal it means the range of time for a marriage.
