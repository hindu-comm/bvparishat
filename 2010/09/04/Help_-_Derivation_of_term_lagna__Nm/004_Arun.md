This clear defintion of Lagna is not known to most practicing  
astrologers. Grammatical definition of Lagna explains its various  
meanings. Even in Hindi or Marathi it is stated-  
गाड़ी प्लैटफ़ार्म पर लग गयी। Here, 'laga' is same as lagna. Similarly  
east horizon joins a point in zodiac like a train, that is lagna. In  
marriage also, man and woman join-that is lagna. Alternately, muhurtta  
for shortest period is Lagna( about 2 hours), so it is strongest. Thus  
'Lagna' in space and marriage are linked-Arun
