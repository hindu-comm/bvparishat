A mistake crept into my posting , done in a hurry ,feel sorry - it is n.yat in 'bhAryA' rather than kyap.



Yes , in Tamilnadu also Lagna is given as one hour or so . We generally take the meaning in currency .



In Andhra also the term 'Lagna' is used as synonym to 'vivAha' by some people , those without 'Upanayanam'.



The SimsumAracakra ( BhUmi) is at 360 BhAgas (degrees) . It is devided into 12 RAsis . Each RAsi is 30 BhAgas to be devided into three DrekkAnas .



There are 27 Naksatras (Abhijit is counted in MuhUrtaskandha in certain instances and not here) , each one devided into four legs(PAdas) , 108 legs in total .



Each RAsi has got nine PAdas - asvinibharanikrttikApAdam mesah , krttikAtrayah rohinimrgasirArdham vrsabham etc.



Taking the Janmanaksatras of Vara and Vadhu as well as the Nityanaksatra the TArAbalam (janmasampadvipat etc ) is counted .



Generally the PancAnga lists some MuhUrtas - take the total sum of Tithi, VAra etc and devide itby nine .

It should be 'rahitam' (no sesa) .



Check the LagnapatrikA (the zodiac with planets ) - there should be
'saptamasuddhi' ,i.e. no planet shoud be

there in JAmitram (kalatra / bhatr -sthAnam , seenth house from Lagnam). In MatAntara there can be a Subhagraha . Guru , Sukra , Budha , PUrnacandra ( sukllAstamI to bahulAstamI) .



Gurubalam and Sukrabalam are very important .Why ? According to SAstra, Brhaspati will obviate one lakh Dosas (defects ) whereas Sukra ten thousand .



This is the reason why there will not be a MuhUrta during Gurumaudhyam and Sukramaudhyam (only) . If any planet falls within 15 BhAgas of Ravi , it faces Astangatatvadosa , i.e.does not have power, the same is called ' Maudhyam' , technically .  
  
Lagna can be roughly ( it varies from RAsi to RAsi and place to place - see NirayanarAsipramAnAni in PancAnga ) two and half hours . MuhUrtam (prefix su or dur ) will be of 48 minutes duration .



In Hindi the dhAtu 'lag' is used in several senses - is ke pIche lagAvo , is dekhne par Apko kyA lagtA hai ?



Towards the end of RAmAyanapravacana someone asked - gurUji ! rAm ko sItA kyA lagtI hai ?(Proverb in Telugu ) .

I just notived Dr Arun's posting .
