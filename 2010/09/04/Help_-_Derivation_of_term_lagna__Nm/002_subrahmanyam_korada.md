Namo vidvadbhyah



I apologize for the delay . Of late I am overtaxed and not been able to attend my due . May I

request other Scholars to keep the heat , just like Dr Bhatt .



Lagna and VivAha , as explained by BhattAh, are not synonyms .



Lagna can be there for other Kamyakarmas also . LagnapatrikA is essential for Upanayanam also .



Panini offers Sabdas in three (NyAsa , Padamanjary etc. say first two only) ways -



1\. Vidhi : Both the Prakrti and Pratyaya are offered , the word is made by combining them -

kr. + tavya = kartavyam



2\. NipAtah : Readymade word is offered , the Prakrti and Pratyaya are deduced - srotriyan

chando'dhIte (Pan 5-2-84, TaittirIyopanisad)- sruti(chandas) + ghan: ksetryac paraksetre

cikitsyah (Pan 5-2-92, Atharvaveda - 10)



3\. Pr.sodarAdIni yathopadistam (Pan 6-3-109) : Sahasram , JImUta , Jyotisam etc .



The term Jyotisam is used by Patanjali (GranthAntAdhike ca,6-3-78, saha = sah) -

samuhUrtam jyotisamadhIte , sakAstham jyotisamadhIte .



The word 'Lagnam' is a NipAta by 'ksubdha .....'(Pan 7-2-18) . Lage sange or lagi gatau

(both bhvAdi) kta-pratyaya , nisthAnatvam ca nipAtanAt in the sense of 'sakta'.



As has already been explained by the Scholar , quoting JyotisasAstra, it is - RAsInAm udayah .



This Sabda canot be generated from any other DhAtu .



VivAha : visesena vahanam - vi + vaha (prApane - bhvAdi) + ghan(cavarga) in BhAva

by 'bhAve'(Pan 3-3-18) .



'BhAva eva hi dhAtvarthah ityavicchinna Agamah' - KriyAsamuddesa , Padakanda, VakyapadIyam .



Visesena = 'dharmArthakAmesu nAticarAmi'iti pratijnApUrvakam , vahanam = bharanam

(bhryate iti bhAryA - kyap, bibhartIti bhartA - trc) . FhAtUnAm anekArthatvAt .



SItA was in LankA (bhartrviyoga) because RAma was born in Karkataka-lagnam .
