The *Suksmagama* is a hitherto unpublished and important *Saivagama* dealing with many Saiva rituals as they are performed in temples. It is held to be one of the twenty-eight fundamental scriptures of the Saivasiddhanta.

The present volume furnishes a critical edition of the first thirteen chapters, out of a total of about a hundred. The edition is based on the collation of eight paper manuscripts and is prefaced by an introduction (both in English and in Sanskrit) that gives a detailed summary of the edited text. The reader will find here treatment of many rites, such as the *punyahavacana* (a rite rarely described at length in other scriptures), the preparation of the *pancagavya*, rites for the worship of Siva in temples, the fire worship, and finally a very detailed description of the grand temple festival.

**Keywords:** Saiva, Saivasiddhanta, agama, ritual

**About the editors:**

-   **S. Sambandhasivacarya** has been working in the French Institute
    of Pondicherry since 1969 in the project of critically editing the
    Saivagama-s. Coming from a family of temple priests, well versed in
    the domain of temple rituals and with a long experience in reading
    various ancient scripts he has rendered great help in the first
    critical editions of *agama*-s such as the *Matangaparamesvara,
    Sardhatrisatikalottara, Rauravottara, Ajita* and *Diptagama*. -   **T. Ganesan** has been working as a Senior Researcher in the French
    Institute of Pondicherry since 1985. His current research project *A
    Comprehensive History of Saivasiddhanta in Tamilnadu* involves the
    work of surveying the contents of the entire gamut of Saivasiddhanta
    literature (Sanskrit and Tamil). The first critical edition of the
    ancient Saiva text, *Varunapaddhati* along with the unpublished
    commentary of Nigamajnana II is one of his main research
    publications concerning the Saiva ritual system.

La création d’une iconographie sivaïte narrative  
*Incarnations du dieu dans les temples pallava construits*

**Valérie Gillet**, Collection Indologie n°113, IFP/EFEO, 2010, 402 p. 250 ill.  
Language: French. **1500 Rs (65 €)**.  
ISBN (IFP): 978-81-8470-180-7.  
ISBN (EFEO): 978-285539-104-5.

At the end of the 7th century, the Pallava dynasty began to construct the first temples built entirely of stone in the Tamil-speaking South. For the most part these were dedicated to Siva and their walls are thus adorned with representations of him in various embodiments, some benign, some fierce and sanguinary, others victorious and regal. A lengthy introduction presents the historical and religious contexts in which this imagery was conceived and flourished. Each chapter of the book is then devoted to one of the principal forms of Siva, and the concluding chapter attempts to outline the iconographical program of a Saiva sanctuary in the Pallava period. Because narrative Saiva art was not widely developed by this time, the illustration of many deeds of Siva had still to be invented. It is therefore the creation of an iconography that we see in Pallava monuments, an iconography inspired both by pan-Indian mythology and by local traditions, borrowing at the same time elements from various religious movements. If some Pallava representations both appear and disappear with the dynasty, most of them were long to exert influence on subsequent South Indian sculptural art. Thus narrative Pallava sculpture appears to stand at the point of origin of a long and now deeply rooted tradition.

**Keywords:** Siva, iconography, Pallava, embodiment of god

**Valérie Gillet** was appointed at the EFEO in 2007 and is working in the Pondicherry Centre, where she studies the pre-tenth-century iconography and epigraphy of the Pallava and Pandya dynasties, who ruled in the Tamil-speaking South.
