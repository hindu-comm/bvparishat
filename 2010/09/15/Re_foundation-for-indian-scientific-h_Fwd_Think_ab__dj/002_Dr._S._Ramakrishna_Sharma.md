Respected Dr. P.R Mukund,

  
  
\>I would be happy to contribute towards that cause and raise funds from my friends, if  
someone in India can initiate and play a leadership role.  
  

Definitely this is a welcome step.  
FISH, Foundation for Indian Scientific Heritage, Surathkal  
would like to take up the action plan. Just waiting for the Conference,  
2011 to be over.  
  
"Puthige Document" to be released during the Conference  
will definitely have columns for practical measures  
to bring back the society to meaningful heritage practices.  
  
Thank you for offering such a service to the willing agent of change.  
  
Regards.  
Dr.Sharma.
