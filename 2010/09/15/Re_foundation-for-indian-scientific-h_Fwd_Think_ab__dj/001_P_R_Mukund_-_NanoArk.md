Dr. Sharma,  
Your point is well taken. We often talk and don't act. Perhaps this forum can come up  
with a plan to start a campaign to eliminate large *pratime* inGanesha puja celebration across the country.  
The forum can decide what the message has to be. I was very impressed by some attempts to promote "Green  
Ganesha" in Bangalore. Perhaps this can become a country wide campaign with the help of some professional  
public relations firm. I would be happy to contribute towards that cause and raise funds from my friends, if  
someone in India can initiate and play a leadership role.  
Commenting in forums of like minded people often do not result in any real positive change, in my opinion.  
Please let me know if this seems like a good idea, and how I can be of service.  
Again, I know from experience that it takes a lot more than sending e-mails to be agents of positive change in society.  
Namaskaara..  
Mukund
