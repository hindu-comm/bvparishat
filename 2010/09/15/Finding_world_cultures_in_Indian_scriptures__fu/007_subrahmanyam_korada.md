There have been instances to show that Scholars at differnt corners of the globe may get  
similar ideas or may propose similar theories --  
  
Aksapada proposed five members (pancAvayava, - PratijnAhetu ..) of
ParArthAnumAnam (NyAyamahAvAkyam) and Vaisesikas (PrasastapAdabhAsyam) as well . MImAmsakas and VedAntins accepted the first three or last three whereas BhadrabAhu and Bauddhas accepted ten Avayavas (Sakti,Saktigraha etc.) .  
Aristotle proposed three membered Syllogism (major premise ...) .  
  
There are three Humors (VAta , Pitta and Kapha) in Ayurveda and Ancient
European Medicine  
proposed four .  
  
But compare MahAbhAsyam of Patanjali and Mein Kampf (My Struggle) of Adolf Hitler . Both the  
concepts , i.e. SwastikA and Arya (Aryan is wrong and may be to mislead they added 'n' ) were  
stolen from MahAbhasyam .  
  
If they are so particular about the JAti of Aryas why not the Language ? Aryas speak Daivy VAk  
whereas otheres speak 'MlecchabhAsA' (literally 'aspastabhAsA') .  
  
Exept some , most of the Linguists from Europe and America borrowed
ideas and concepts  
from Indian Grammatical Theatre but failed to acknowledge . How longer will this continue ?  
  
Indian Culture , strongly associated with Dharma (including Language) , is Universal . Satyam vada  
etc. are the same for all .  
  
Indian sages are Yogis (composed) and most of their Western counterparts are full of RAga and  
Dvesa .  
  
Astrologers from Persia used to visit Indian Scholars and thus we got some terms like Anapha,  
SunaphA, DuradhurA (see Suyogasatakam) which are not Sanskrit .  
  
\*Yoga , Ayurveda , Panini etc are enough to show the richness and Worldwide acceptability of  
Indian Culture .  
There has been an uninterrupted tradition since time immemorial on Indian soil and the talk that  
it came 5000 years ago etc. is to be believed by the gullible .  
  
For Indians there are no 'others' , i.e. vasudhiva kutumbakam (alpArthe kan) .  
  
This does not fall under Atmastuti - in Adiparva of MahAbhAratam , GarutmAn says that he can pulverize the seven Kulaparvatas etc and claims it is just his capacity .
