Respected Scholars,  
  
Namaste.  
  
Quite interesting discussion. I think an opinion poll is also required on this debate. Sanskritists, historians, archaeologists, linguists may discuss this issue together for a better perspective. Contextually, here I think aloud - why India has been attributed with the word 'vishwa guru'? and as some great souls say 'I am a universal citizen'. Is there any distinction in the analysis of their usage?

Thanks&Regards,  
Prasad
