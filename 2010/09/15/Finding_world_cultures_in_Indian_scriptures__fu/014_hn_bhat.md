Like many other words, polysemy being the nature of Sanskrit Language, the word "Brahman" is liable to diversified explanations that each shastra would offer its own explanation on the different contexts and texts it is used. The word ब्रह्मचर्य is also liable to different explanations from the learned scholars in different disciplines in this group. But its usage in the sense of "celibacy" is specific and restricted in the Yogashastra and its usage in the commonly known sense brahmaacarin = a celibate person is an extension of the same. Etymologically ब्रह्म चरतीति ब्रह्मचारी, तस्य भावः - ब्रह्मचर्यम् is the explains the derivation of the word. Nothing more than that. Whereas, the word ब्रह्मन् carries with this the following meaning attested by its usages provided in the database of digital corpus of Sanskrit Dictionary:

##  

## Meanings

-   a sacred text (Monier-Williams, Sir M. (1988)) -   a text or Mantra used as a spell (Monier-Williams, Sir M. (1988)) -   final emancipation (Monier-Williams, Sir M.

And "brahmacarya" is restricted in its meaning:

  

## Meanings

-   a state of continence and chastity (Monier-Williams, Sir M. (1988)) -   study of the Veda (Monier-Williams, Sir M. (1988)) -   the state of an unmarried religious student (Monier-Williams, Sir M.
    (1988))

  

अहिंसास्त्रेयब्रह्मचर्यापरिग्रहाः यमाः॥२.३०॥

The explanation offered by the commentators on the Sutra restricts the meaning to celibacy or chastity which avoids the eight types of contact with women:

इत्यष्टविधमैथुनवर्जनम्। And,

  

"ब्रह्मचर्यप्रतिष्ठायां वीर्यलाभः" (२.३८) also confirms this interpretation. Here also the term वीर्य may differ in meaning in other contexts, but by proximity, the commentators unanimously explain ब्रह्मचर्ये सति = वीर्यनिरोधे सति, ... । Etymology doesn't help much in this respect. वीरस्य भावः = वीर्यम्। वीरे साधुः - वीर्यम्।

"वीर्यं तेजःप्रभावयोः। शुक्रे शक्तौ च" (२.३८५) इति हैमः lexicon and commentaries help on the other hand. In general, the term can be liberally used to mean unmarried person or a bachelor.

  

As it happens, "आचार्याय प्रियं धनमुपहृत्य प्रजातन्तुं मा व्यवच्छेत्सीः"
this injunction implies celibacy and chastity before he finishes and returns from his ब्रह्मचर्य = the study of Veda-s, from the Gurukula. This is the base for its interpretation as celibacy in Yoga-shastra texts. Even after marriage, it is used as नैष्ठिकब्रह्मचर्य = restricted Brahmacarya, = celibacy. Having intercourse, just to fullfil the Vedic Injunction as in the quoted portion and many others to the same effect. And, marriage was not considered as for sensual pleasure. All this shade of meaning implied with the above quotation. In Kamashastra also there are certain periods prescribed for the intercourse and certain occasions to be avoided. Following them is also considered as Naishthika brahmacarya. "ऋतुषु दारान् उपेयात्" etc. As time elapsed, the system of Vedadhyana changed, and the return from Gurukula is not at all observed, except a ritual called Samaavartana (return from Gurukula after finishing Vedadhyayana) just before the marriage rites. So in effect, the word "Brahmacarya" came to be limited to chastity in its general use. Though in respective Shastra-s it may have different connotations uncommon to normal user.

  

For the term "Asura: also, the negative preposition carries with it six shades of meaning:

  

तत्सादृश्यमभावश्च तदव्यत्वं तदल्पता।

अप्राशस्त्यं विरोधश्च नञर्थाः षट् प्रकीर्तिताः॥

  

Compounded in any of the six shades of meaning, न सुर इत्यसुरः can mean widely different things. So in respect of this word also it can be interpreted. In Vedic context, every thing depends on the preceding and following sequence. असून् राति = ददाति इति असुरः, शक्त इत्यर्थः। असुरस्य मायया has been interpretted in this way. असुरस्य = शक्तस्य, वृष्टिरोधकस्य, पर्जन्यस्य, मायया = सामर्थ्येन , (RV 5.63.3). In different contexts it may take different meanings. Not only its usage limited to demons, who are opposed to सुर-s. In this usage, it takes Virodha signified by the नञ्. The Amarakosha also supports this usage:

  

"असुरा दैत्यदैतेय+ ... पूर्वदेवाः सुरद्विषः।(१.१.१२) 

  

The other meanings are purely contextual ones.

  

This much I could offer offhand.

  

Much more learned postings can be solicited always.
