Respected scholars,



Some of the ideas/concepts of Socrates may have resemblance with those of Upanishads’ discourses. So what? Does it mean that Socrates took directly all the ideas from Upanishads? Is there any slightest proof that he knew Sanskrit? If we will cram every culture in to Vedic basket, it will become waste paper bin. Is it not over exaggeration to declare that ancient cultures of every nook and corner of the world have their traces in Vedic mythology? Why shall we not take the resemblances as mere parallelism of ideas? There is an adage in Sanskrit : संवादिन्यो मेधाविनां बुद्धयः।(Great men think alike)
