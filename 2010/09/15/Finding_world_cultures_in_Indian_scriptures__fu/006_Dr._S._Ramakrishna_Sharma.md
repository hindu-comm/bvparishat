"**DNA study, and other observations of mine, which I will write about sometime, now admits that the migration happened from the North-Western Region of Indian Peninsula to Europe in 40,000 BC. It would be wrong to say that all the things that make up a civilization happened in the last 5000 years only and before that there was no civilization. The western thinking was very much influenced by Bible's Genesis, which said that the world was made in 7 days, around 5000 years back, and this was a big influence to them. In another posting, I will show that the stories of Bible, in Old Testament specially, are of Babylonia and Egyptian origin, which were copied from Persians and their eastern sources, but some where misunderstood or taken literally.**"  
Pictures of Sri Sunil Srivastava's personal findings are provided in the above blogs.  
** "This is another symbol of Native Americans, which I picked up a long time back, when I was researching on Swastika. Think that this comes from Snake Mounds of Ohio. Sometime I will come up with an article on Swastika signs being found all over the world from ancient times.  
  
Interestingly, a Snake Mound was found very close to Stonehenge. Swastika signs have also been found in Stone Circles, and if I am not mistaken in the Urns found in Stonehenge. There could be more Snake Mounds associated with Stone Circles, which I need to further research."  
  
Some more excerpts:  
  
"Here is the "opposite" effect happening, which has been observed a few times in Sanskrit and English words.  

Like English "hit" and Sanskrit "hit" have opposite connotations but in strict Victorian sense, sometimes a child for his benefit, could be subjected to a corporeal punishment, which is the meaning of Sanskrit "hit". The other word is "vish" or "wish", where the meanings are opposite - in Sanskrit "wish" means "poison" and in English "wish" means "desire". How true "Desire is Poison!", as Buddha said!!  
The second effect observed would be that Sanskrit sounds would be more modulated and refined in their wording of a meaning but in English ones, they would be approximated. This is same as a Good Singer's sound being copied by a Bad Singer - or an Initiated and Cultured Language being copied by a uninitiated and vulgur.  
This is true if you know the history of Europe and it got civilized and developed past 1200 AD. English is just a few hundred years old language.  
This all shows and adds to evidence how the civilization flowed, which is shared by DNA Studies.  
Now do not tell me that Man only learned to speak 5000 BC when we have artifacts which are much older and indicate of advanced civilizations. Check out my "Hidden Archeology" posting."
