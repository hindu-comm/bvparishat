This is the original quotation of Anandavardhana:

  

संवादास्तु भवन्त्येव बाहुल्येन सुमेधसाम्।

स्थितं ह्येतत् संवादिन्य एव मेधाविनां बुद्धयः॥ ध्वन्यालोक ४.१

वृत्तिः।

  

I also had the same feeling. But I abstained from raising it, I am certain that it will attract serious attacks from all the cornerson seeing the spirit of our group.

  

Aristotle's ideas on Poetics have been studied with those of Bharata's analysis of plays for comparison purpose. Fortunately no body have tried to trace the ideas of Aristotle to Vedic Literature (perhaps it may also be possible) to declare it as such also.

  

Anyhow you have raised a controversial topic (which I also had in mind for long). Let me watch the developments. I am just watching the responses.

  

With regards
