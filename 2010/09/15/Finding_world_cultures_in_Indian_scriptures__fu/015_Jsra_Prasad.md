Namaste.Thought to bring to your kind notice, a bit of textual information.  
The definition of 'asura' has been explained by Durgacharya on his commentary on Niruktam (3.2.7). It goes like this-  
  
ये हि स्थानेषु स्वनिवासभूमिषु सुष्ठु रताः प्रीता न भवन्ति, किन्त्वितस्ततोऽतृप्ता इव धावन्ति चपलास्तेऽसुराः ।  
अथवा स्थानेभ्योऽस्ता देवैः प्रच्याविताः इत्यसुराः असु - क्षेपणे (दि.प.) असेरुन् (उ. १.४२) इत्युरन् ।  
  
Prof. Lakshman Sarup (1930s) translates thus -  
"Demons (a-su-rAh) are (so called because ) they delight in evil places, or they are expelled from places (as=to throw)  
...they are the eaters of sacred food and holy."  
  
It seems, he has omitted the translation of first definition given by Durgacharya.  
  
धन्योऽस्मि ।
