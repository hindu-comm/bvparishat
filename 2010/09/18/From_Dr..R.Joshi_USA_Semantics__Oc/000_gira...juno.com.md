Respected Scholars, Namaskar!

Shaktivāda of Gadadhara?

The proper interpretation of the Vedic canon, especially the meaning of injunctions and precepts involved in ritual practice, was of great significance in Brahminical society. Mĩmāmsā, the science of Vedic hermeneutics, involved itself not only with questions about the consistency and coherence of the Vedic corpus, but engaged more widely in developing a philosophical account of language, the origins and nature of meaning. Then there were the mainstream philosophical schools belonging to the Indian epistemological tradition: the Nyāya, Vaişeśika, Buddhist and other authors who operated within conceptual boundaries of the pramāņa methodology. For these philosophers too, language occupied a central place, this time because of the epistemological importance attributed to testimony. Concern with the communication of knowledge focused attention on the nature of understanding and interpreting another’s speech, and on the relation between meaning and truth. From this confluence of interest, the main themes later to emerge in Indian philosophy of language were debate over whether semantic properties are natural or conventional. Interests extended to the discussion of the meaning relation and its proper relata and the issue of whether words as against sentences are the principal bearers of meaning and more general explorations into linguistics and the epistemology of testimony---From the book of Jonardon Generi-Semantic Powers, Clarendon Press,Oxford, 1999.

From Vyādi to Gadādhara of Shaktivāda, the topic was continuously discussed over more than 2000 years by many Indian scholars.  
Question-On this list there are scholars knowing Navya-Nyāya and the work of Gadādhara. Is it possible for them to discuss the main ideas of Shaktivāda and its unique contribution to the semantics ?
