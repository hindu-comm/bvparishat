Respected scholars,  
  

I feel the Indian scriptures (and any scripture any where in the world) have not been able to preserve all the knowledge which they once embodied. Even Maharshi Ved Vyas and his contemporaries were worried about the loss of the scriptures and developed elaborate classifications and definitions to preserve what ever scriptures were available then.  
  
At no time of human history has any culture remained completely isolated from the other cultures and so we do find ancient culture from every nook and corner incorporated in the contemporary literature, including mythology and scriptures. For example a lot of information about Indian civilization (some of it highly distorted like gold digging ants larger than dogs) are available in Greek mythology.  
  
Much of such information has been deliberately destroyed for religious reasons. In spite of that we can even now trace the beliefs in the reincarnation of the soul, worship of the mother Goddess and other such things among the early Christians, Arabian contemporary of Prophet Mohamed, ancient Egypt etc.  
  
The fact remains that the Indian scriptures, in spite of similar attacks and destruction, still retain the largest collection of references to the ancient civilizations. It is certain that like the scriptures of any civilization those are affected by all the contemporary cultures of different times.  
  
With regards,  
  
Yours truly,  
  
D.D.Misra
