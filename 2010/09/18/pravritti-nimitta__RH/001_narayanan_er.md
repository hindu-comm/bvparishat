Respected Scholars,

I would like to share a bit out of my memory on the topic
प्रवृत्तिनिमित्तम्। Please correct me where ever I went wrong. I expect more authentic explanations from great learned thinkers.  

1\. प्रवृत्तिनिमित्तम् is some thing what the cause for action. Suppose we take the etymology of the word “गो” (Bull / Cow) as गच्छति इति गौः। (someone goes is a bull/cow). Suppose if bull/cow is not going according to its etymological meaning (व्युत्पत्तिनिमित्तम्), then what bull/cow it is?And non-going as well as going animal here will be termed as bull/cow. Thus it has been said in the *Vyktiviveka* by Mahimabhatta: “गच्छत्यगच्छति च गवि गोपदव्यपदेशो भवति। अन्यच्च व्युत्पत्तिनिमित्तम् अन्यच्च प्रवृत्तिनिमित्तम्।” And here comes the relevance of प्रवृत्तिनिमित्तम् (the cause for action). The sounds like “गो” (Bull / Cow) for instance, might have indulged in the following शब्दप्रवृत्तिः (causes of word): जातिः (species) e.g. cow, dog etc. गुण (quality)e.g. loving, angry, intelligent, artistic etc. क्रिया (action)e.g. reader, farmer etc. द्रव्यम् (Matter) etc. This is according to the grammarians. Some add संबंद्धः (relation) e.g. princely-man, father-son etc. and रूढिः (custom) e.g. पङ्कजम् for lotus flower (पङ्कजनिकर्तृ) also.

2. The semantic approach may be based on the levels of meanings are intended. The relationship of sounds and meanings in the forms of process of meaning like अभिधा लक्षणा व्यञ्जना, तात्पर्यम् etc. are to be followed accordingly.

The mistakes misconception and ignorance from my part are regretted.
