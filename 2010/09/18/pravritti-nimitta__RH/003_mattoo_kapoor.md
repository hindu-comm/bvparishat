Respected Scholars,  
I would like to share a bit out of my memory on the topic  
प्रवृत्तिनिमित्तम्।Please correct me where ever I went wrong. I expect more  
authentic explanations from great learned thinkers.

1\. प्रवृत्तिनिमित्तम् is some thing what the cause for action. Suppose we take  
the etymology of the word “गो”(Bull / Cow) as गच्छति इति गौः। (someone goes is a  
bull/cow). Suppose if bull/cow is not going according to its etymological  
meaning (व्युत्पत्तिनिमित्तम्), then what bull/cow it is?And non-going as well  
as going animal here will be termed as bull/cow. Thus it has been said in the  

Vyktivivekaby Mahimabhatta: “गच्छत्यगच्छति च गवि गोपदव्यपदेशो भवति। अन्यच्च  

व्युत्पत्तिनिमित्तम् अन्यच्च प्रवृत्तिनिमित्तम्।” And here comes the relevance  
of प्रवृत्तिनिमित्तम् (the cause for action). The sounds like “गो” (Bull / Cow)  
for instance, might have indulged in the following शब्दप्रवृत्तिः (causes of  
word): जातिः (species) e.g. cow, dog etc. गुण (quality)e.g. loving, angry,  
intelligent, artistic etc. क्रिया (action)e.g. reader, farmer etc. द्रव्यम्  
(Matter) etc. This is according to the grammarians. Some add संबंद्धः (relation)  

e.g. princely-man, father-son etc. andरूढिः (custom) e.g. पङ्कजम् for lotus
