Pranaam to all the respected scholars,  
Since joining BVP I have gained a lot in terms of knowledge but  
couldn't bring myself to ask a question. Finally I am taking the  
courage of asking a question which may help clear a lagging doubt in  
my mind -  
1.What is the concept of "pravritti-nimitta" as I have come across  
many ancient texts discussing this concept but not explaining clearly  
what is exactly "pravritti-nimitta"?  
2.How may this concept be applicable in semantics?
