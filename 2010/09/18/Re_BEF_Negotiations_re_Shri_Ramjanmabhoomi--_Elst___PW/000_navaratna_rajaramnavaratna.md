 Koenraad has a point. I have encountered the same problem in fields as diverse as mathematics and quantum reality where Vedanta can make a contribution. We are sitting on a treasure trove of knowledge but there is no professionalism and no attempt to builda credible foundation.



Instead, what we get are outlandish claims in the name of 'spirituality' and ancient wisdom. I have to fend off objections from critics who cite these quacks when I speak of the metaphysical insights offered by Vedanta on some modern problems. The same with Vedic mathematics.



 I appeal to all concerned to focus on content and not worry too much about who was the first to come up with an idea. This calls for deeper understanding and will raise the standard of discourse.
