Puzzle of Indus seal

This question is in general for all scholars and in particular to Dr. Kalyanraman who spent many years in research on Indus script. I did not read his latest book.  
Here is the puzzle-We all have seen a photo of the Indus seal of a man sitting folded legs. He has two horns. He is surrounded by animals. Many researchers identified him as Pashupati. Some related him to Dravidian civilization. The age of Indus civilization and seals are roughly estimated as 3000 BC. How come the same deity appears carved on a 27 inches diameter silver bowl (Gundestrup Cauldron) of 150 BC found in Denmark.

Reference:Timothy Taylor, "Gundestrup Cauldron", Scientific American, March 1992, pp84-89.

On the cauldron there are removable plates. They also carry carvings of Vis'Nu, Laxmi and two elephants. The nose of Laxmi is European style. The elephant shoulders show that the artist might not have seen real elephants but copying from other sources. The time difference between 3000 BC and 150 BC is very large. Who carried these deities from 3000 BC from Indus valley to 150 BC Europe? Very few scholars in India know Celtic Invasion of Prehistoric Europe including Britain and Rome. But Indian scholars made their careers on Aryan Invasion of India. Strange things happen even in the world of scholars. Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
