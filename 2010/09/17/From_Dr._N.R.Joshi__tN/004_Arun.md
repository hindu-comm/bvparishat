It is necessary to know what is yajna. Whatever is done in name of  
Yajna is not that. Only 10 verses of Gita (3/10-16) are sufficent to  
understand it. Yajna is production of desired objects in a cycle,  
whose time has been called Janya kala in surya-siddhanta (1/10). Peace  
can be maintained only when people try to roduce their needs instead  
of looting it from others. That quality of India has been written by  
all Greek writers-Herodotus, Megasthenes, Arian etc. In Kurma  
incarnation also, it was explained to Asuras that it was necessary to  
cooperate for production. Unless, something is produced, it can not be  
looted. That cooperation was called samudra manthana whose tradition  
still survives. My article-concept of Yajna on scribd/Arunupadhyay may  
be seen-Arun
