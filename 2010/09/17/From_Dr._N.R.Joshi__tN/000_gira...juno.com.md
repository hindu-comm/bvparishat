Respected Scholars, Namaste!

If Yajnyas produce peace, please use it!

I was criticized by saying that performing Yajnyas for peace with reciting Vaidika mantras did not produce peace in the world.

My sincere request to those who believe that Yajnyas bring peace, please contact the Central govt of India and use the Yajnya science to bring peace in Kashmir. At least do it for those Kashmiri Sanskrit Pandits who are driven from their homes from Kashmir. India govt is desperately looking for solution of the burning Kashmir. If India has such peace producing science, why not to use it to bring tangible result of peace to Kashmiri brothers. Thanks. N.R.Joshi
