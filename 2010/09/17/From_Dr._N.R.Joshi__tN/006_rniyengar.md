I am interested in the book "Darshapoornamaasa prakaasha" mentioned  
below. Is it available in Bangalore? When I tried at Vedanta book  
house some time back it was not available. Details with Publisher,  
language of the book, address, phone etc would be helpful.

thanks

\> Important Messages from some of the procedures in the rituals are: \*  
\> \*Iswara Samarpana\* – Offer the result of your action to God, without

\> \*Pray for Abundance\* to satiate your desire, rather than usurp someone’s  
\> share.  
\> \*Identify the common factors\* in every creature to increase acquaintance,

  
\> which is the essence of Vedic Texts  

\> \*Realise that you are not the actual doer\*, but a tool in the hands of

  
\> divine. Hence, never claim/ think that you are the owner/ boss of the  
\> objects/subjects/wealth, deemed to be your own.  

\> \*Habituate to Identify divinity\*/ existence of all pervading Brahman in

  
\> every creature/ atom without any exception. Thus the chances of perpetration

\> \*Respect the right of life\*/ existence conferred on every being. Never lay
