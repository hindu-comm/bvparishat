Namaste,  
I have recently set up a trust called Kalpa Heritage Trust with the  
objective of sourcing material on Kalpa Shastra dealing with Hindu  
Rituals,digitally storing them and making them available for anyone  
interested free of charge. I would appreciate it if you would visit  
the website of the trust at [www.kalpaheritage.com](http://www.kalpaheritage.com) and offer your  
comments and suggestions.  
I also request members to send us any information they have pertaining  
to Hindu Rituals for inclusion in the website.  
Regards ,  
V.R.Anil Kumar
