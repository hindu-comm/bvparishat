Dula is mentioned as one of the six stars or mothers of Karttikeya in  
Taittiriya samhita (4/4/5/10) and Taittiriya Brahmana (3/1/4/4). I  
have interprated as 6 centers of power (like military headquarters) of  
Karttikeya. Temples of Dula-Devi are around Konarka region only where  
Karttikeya had erected a victory pillar after his victory over  
Krauncha Dvipa as indicated in Brahma purana etc. 'Dulal' name is  
popular in Bengal-it literally means son of Dula. 'Chupunika' appears  
to be in Punjab where Chopra title is common. Meghayanti may be in  
Gujarat and Rajsthan where there are few megha (clouds) but many  
persons with title Meghani and Meghwal. Varshayanti may be in Asam-  
start of rains. Abhrayanti can be in Andhra and Maharashtra. That  
leaves Nitatni-which should be in Tamilnadu and Karnataka. I am not  
sure about its meaning in Tamila or Kannada.  
Real genetic mother of Karttikeya was called Bahula (he is called  
Bahuleyah). She might be from Vishakha-surrounded on both sides by  
Nagavali and Vamshadhara-remaining separate from source of Thuamul-  
rampur in Kalahandi (Orissa). There could be a link between meaning of  
Dula in Kashmir and in Orissa-Arun
