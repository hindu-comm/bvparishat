Comment:



dula means 'pair' (Kashmiri) Thus two goats etc. may denote dul 'cast in mold' + med.ha 'goat' (rebus: med. 'iron' (Ho.); two bulls may denote dul 'cast' + d.hangra 'bull' (rebus: d.hangar, t.hakur 'smith'). So, the paired goats and bulls should refer to cast iron, casting smith respectively.



Same goes for two tigers. tiger is kul; rebus 'kol' meaning working in iron (Tamil); thus two tigers should denote dul + kol meaning: working in cast iron.



The mirror imaging of svastika (left-rotating, right-rotating) glyphs may also relate to the semantics of dula ‘pair or mirror image’.
