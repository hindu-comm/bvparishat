**Provide receipts for EVM votes: Swamy**

M. Rajeev, Sept. 13, 2010 The Hindu

HYDERABAD: Janata Party president Subramanian Swamy has demanded that the Election Commission (EC) take steps to provide a paper trail (receipts) for votes cast through the Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) and revert to ballot papers until arrangements for this were made.

Claiming that the ballot system provided for “retail rigging” while the EVMs gave scope for rigging on a “wholesale” basis, Mr. Swamy alleged that the ruling Congress had secured at least 90 seats more in the previous Lok Sabha elections, if the study of votes cast in individual polling booths was any indication.

“Going by the number of booths in which voting was as low as three and zero in some instances, it becomes clear that the Congress got at least 90 seats more,” Mr. Swamy — accompanied by V. Hariprasad, who is fighting against the use of EVMs — told a press conference here on Sunday.

Mr. Swamy came down heavily on the EC authorities for “propagating lies” claiming that no demonstration on the tampering of EVMs was made, that Indian EVMs were appreciated the world over, and that the EC was not bound by any statute.

“While several countries have reverted to the ballot system, the commission should provide receipts in line with the IT Act of 2000,” he said.

The EC, Mr. Swamy said, had in fact applied for a patent on EVMs, but withdrew the application after the World Intellectual Property Organisation clarified that the machine was not patentable.

Moreover, no international body had certified Indian EVMs, and the only country that followed the Indian machines was Bhutan, which had no other option.

“Japan, where the chips of the EVMs are made, did not adopt the EVMs,” he said.

Mr. Swamy said there was a threat to Mr. Hariprasad, against whom bogus cases had been registered.

Mr. Swamy demanded that the cases be withdrawn, as Mr. Hariprasad had no intention to defraud people, or he would sue the EC for Rs.10 crore.

Mr. Hariprasad claimed that top EC authorities had accepted that there were problems with EVMs, but were apprehensive of the political fall-out. The EC was prepared to make changes in the existing model of the EVMs.

Hyderabad; Alleging that a false case was registered against Hari K Prasad, a city-based computer engineer by Maharashtra Police, the Janata Party on Sunday demanded that the Centre and the Election Commission immediately withdraw the "bogus" case against him.  
  
Asserting that Prasad, a software specialist who was arrested last month from here by Mumbai Police on charges of stealing an Electronic Voting Machine (EVM) from Maharashtra, had only demonstrated that EVMs can be tampered with, Janata Party president Subramanian Swamy said that Prasad did not commit any crime.  
  
Addressing a press conference jointly organised by VeTA (Citizens for Verifiability, Transparency, and Accountability in Elections) and Jana Chaitanya Vedika here, Swamy said that Hari Prasad's event had become a "laughing stock" and an "international shame" on India.

"I demand that the bogus case against Hari Prasad be withdrawn. He is anyhow going to win the case," Swamy said. Swamy said he had written a letter to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh seeking protection for Hari Prasad and added that he would also meet the Prime Minister in this matter.

  
  

  

"If any harm happens to Prasad, then I will hold the government responsible for any such act," he said. Stating that the selection of the government through election is a sacred matter, Swamy said "we should be absolutely sure that the procedure is valid and transparent."  
  
The former Union Minister further demanded the government and ECI should provide a paper receipt after casting of an vote like after completion of a transaction at ATMs. If it cannot make the provision then it is better that the ECI return back to ballot papers as it happened in Europe, he happened.  
  
During ballot paper voting there used to be rigging at polling booth level but with EVMs chip a whole election can be stolen, Swamy alleged. He termed the ballot paper rigging as at "retail level" and the EVMs rigging as "whole-sale" rigging.

### Elections, Votes, Machinations… or, Just Another Conspiracy Theory

*Mr Bond, they have a saying in Chicago*  
*Once is happenstance*  
*Twice is a coincidence*  
*The third time it's enemy action*  
-- Auric Goldfinger to James Bond in Ian Fleming's 'Goldfinger'

THE following is a mere conspiracy theory. There is no proof, no evidence, no witness, nothing at all...

*Circa 2004*, The BJP-led NDA government is going strong. In fact, so strong that they announce elections a few months early (May instead of October), and are stunned into defeat by a Congress under Sonia Gandhi that had been written off by all and sundry. In Andhra Pradesh, the Telangana Rashtra Samithi joins hands with the Congress for the assembly elections, and wins 26 out of 54 seats (almost 50%) even as the Congress sweeps to power in the state. Oh! EVM are used across the country for the first time ever.

*Circa 2009*, the UPA government has completed five years in power and poll pundits say it has not achieved much. BJP leader LK Advani believes it is his moment in the sun and campaigns hard across India. But, the UPA wins and the Congress betters its position. In Andhra Pradesh, the TRS is no longer with the Congress after the latter reneged on its promise to create Telangana. It wins just 10 of 45 seats (less than a 25%). Oh! EVM are used all across India.

*Circa 2010*, by-elections are held in the Telangana region of Andhra Pradesh. The TRS wins 11 of 11 seats contested (100%). And oh! EVM are**NOT**used!

The reason: TRS chief K Chandrasekhara Rao had serious doubts about the reliability of EVM. An EVM can only list 64 candidates, to ensure that ballot papers are used, Rao got his supporters to stand for elections as independents so that the constituencies have at least 65 candidates.

Of course, the above three instances may be just coincidence, despite what Ian Fleming claimed. After all, there are many reasons for the TRS victory in 2004 (allied with a resurgent Congress), defeat in 2009 (allied with a down-in-the-dumps Telugu Desam Party) and wins in 2010 (Congress leader YS Reddy was no more, the Congress was disunited, and the campaign for a separate Telangana had seen resurgence of support for Rao). There is every reason to believe that the TRS would have won regardless of whether EVM were used or not. But the fact remains, Rao still did not trust the EVM.

Similarly, there are many who believe that the NDA dug its own grave in 2004 by harping on 'India Shining', a theme for the middle class that ignored the poor, and in 2009 by targeting Manmohan Singh, still the darling of the middle class. The growing presence of Narendra Modi in 2009, say poll pundits, saw disenchanted voters still end up backing the Congress. But what remains is that two general elections with EVM in full use saw Congress beat the odds...

The fact that the victories of the Congress and its allies went in tandem with the increasing use of the EVM has not been missed by both the opposition parties and by citizens who support free and fair democracy, not any political party. No wonder then that many want the EVM re-evaluated.

But with a stubbornness that is hard to believe, the Election Commission has flatly refused to consider the suggestion. Three technologists - V Hari Prasad, Rop Gonggrijp, and J Alex Haldermen - have demonstrated that an EVM can be hacked into and results fixed to suit a particular candidate. Instead of applauding the three, the EC had Hari Prasad arrested for getting hold of an EVM unofficially!

The EC must understand that like Caesar's wife, it needs to be above suspicion. Alas, it is not so, particularly after former chief election commissioners have shown remarkable ability to join political parties after retiring. TN Seshan joined the BJP (but this was in the pre-EVM era) while a CEC of recent vintage, MS Gill, is now the Congress minister of sports (and in the limelight for the CWG mess). Everyone expects the recently retired Navin Chawla, known for his proximity to Sonia Gandhi, to also be appointed soon.

With election commissioners joining political parties after superannuation but refusing to allow tests on EVM, there is reason to worry about India and democracy. This is not to suggest that the men at the EC are anything but honourable or that there is, or ever was, any conspiracy by any party or individual at all. But to be above any doubt, the EC and the Congress must support a re-evaluation of the EVM, and before the 2014 elections. Otherwise, Auric Goldfinger's words may well haunt everyone...

Someone was wondering how can one 'capture' millions of EVMs. Obviously they weren't doing the mandatory homework reading.  
  
One need not even TOUCH a EVM. It is enough to get access to the chips or the circuit board or any of the hundreds of ICs attached to the boards at the designing, integration or manufacturing level. Programming additional streams of instructions at chip level in machine language is child stuff — a well-versed hacker or even a script-kiddie virus maker would be able to put together a neat trojan that can AUTOMATICALLY get triggered if certain conditions are met. Say, the area code fed into the machine + number of voters + polled voters... trigger a change in the result. Voila!  
  
From there on, it's game on.

Any machine can be hacked. Quite spectacularly too.  
  
I am willing to bet anything that if the EVMs are provided to a 'Pwn 2 Own' kind of competition, they won't last a FULL MINUTE.  
  
A security chain is only as strong as its weakest link. Here the weakest link is that it is assembled in India with parts manufactured elsewhere.  
  
And with the degree of corruption that exists in India, and the budgets involved in any election... I bet the EVM can be had for a tiny price. (The trio proved this point too).  
  
Industrial intelligence can provide exact information on where, how and who handles the manufacturing and assembling process.  
  
Elections in India are a multi-trillion-dollar business (the Telecom scam itself must have netted the DMK and Congress Party a few billions, what to say about others). A mere million would get a trojan horse into the EVMs.  
  
Can anybody argue?
