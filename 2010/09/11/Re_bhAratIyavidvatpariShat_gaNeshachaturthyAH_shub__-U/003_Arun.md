Significance of 21 number in selection of plants is remarkable. It is  
difficult to link properties of plants with 21 aspects of universe or  
human body. Plants can be different in different climates and  
countries. India has all the climates, but these plants appear to be  
from Maharashtra and Andhra region.  
21 (3x7) are called foundation of world in first sentence of Veda-that  
is Atharva-veda as per Mundakopanishad (1/1/1-5). Ganapati Atharva  
Shirsha tells that Ganesha is Pratyaksha Brahma, and form of all  
Devas. Somebody expressed doubt to my father-what happened to other  
Gods? Pratyaksha = visible. That can be counted. Whaever view or  
knowledge can be seen and counted-it is Ganesha. Ganana = to count. In  
that sense, it is classified into 3 sevens. I had explained that as  
foundation of Vedic Sciences in a long article in journal of LBS  
Sanskrit Academy, Delhi. What is Bhava or Rasa can not be counted-that  
aspect is Saraswati (sa rasa wati). Some of the meanings of 3 sevens  
can be seen in my explanation of Bismillah (786) on my website.  
Creator himself is undivided-that is 22nd element। (अविभक्तम्  
विभक्तेषु यः पश्यति स पश्यति-गीता) So there are 22 steps in Puri  
Jagannatha Temple and 22 rings in Garuda stambha at Tirumala, Rama  
mandira near Shringeri and many temples in Kumbhakonam. Tirumal mandir  
has 16+6 rings which can be 16+6 verses in Yajurveda, chapter 31,  
called Purusha and Uttara-Narayana Suktas.  
3 and 7 is also basis of Jaina philosophy. 3 words-Asti, nasti and  
syat are combined to form 7 groups called sapta-bhangi nyaya. That is  
beutifully expressed in a verse of Srimad Bhagavata purana in praise  
of Srikrishna indicating him as tri-satya and 7 other satyas. There  
are many alternate meanings of that which I leave to scholars and just  
quote it-  
ये त्रि सप्ताः परियन्ति विश्वाः-अथर्व (1/1/1)  
सत्य व्रतम् सत्यपरं त्रिसत्यं सत्यस्य योनिं निहितं च सत्ये ।  
सत्यस्यसत्यं ऋतसत्यनेत्रं सत्यात्मकं त्वां शरणं प्रपद्ये । (श्रीमद  
भागवत पुराण )

\> The efforts of Sri Sumbrahmanyam in reminding the members of BVParishat with regard to the significance of the 21 leavesused in the SiddhiVinayaka Pujaare praise worthy. But there is one more thing to be added in this context. In the table given in his mail the Botanical family names of the 21 plants/trees only are given. The Botanical names of those 21 plants/trees are different from their Botanical family names. Hence The respective Botanical names of the 21 plants/trees (along with their Botnaical family names) are added in the attached file. Interested members may have a glace of it.  
\> Sorry for the delayed posting of this information. As I have seen the said postingthis afternoon at2.00PM I have thought of
supplementing this information and just now prepared this.
