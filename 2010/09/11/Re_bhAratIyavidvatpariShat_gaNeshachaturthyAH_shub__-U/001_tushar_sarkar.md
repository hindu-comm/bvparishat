Dear Dr. Sadasivamurthy,  
 I read with keen interest your posting on Dr Subrahmanyam about the significance of the 21 plant-leaves used in siddhi vinayaka Puja & their Botanical names.Does the **3rd column** of thetable of names of the plants contain just those names that are writtem in Devanagri in the **firs**t column?I do not read Telegu, so I could not figure out. Can you help? Thanks.  

Professor Tushar Sarkar.
