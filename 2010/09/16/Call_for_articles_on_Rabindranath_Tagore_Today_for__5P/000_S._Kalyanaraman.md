THE THEME  
Rabindranath Tagore's amazing career fulfilled several roleslitterateur, creative artist, pedagogue, social and political theorist, rural reconstructionist, entrepreneur and a major global thinker. Widely travelled, Rabindranath interacted with the foremost global visionaries, offering ideas that combined ethics and economics, artistic creativity, translation, literature and art, critiques of violence, nationalism and any curtailment of personal freedom. Tagore's legacy continues to engage us as we stepped into 150 years of his birth, especially forcing us to reexamine our perspectives in more recent disciplines like environmental sciences, alternative education practices, social work, historiography, rural reconstruction and of course globalisation studies. This volume seeks to explore the range of Tagore's ideas by bringing together interdisciplinary articles that evaluate the relevance of Tagore's literature and ideas in the context of the21st century.
