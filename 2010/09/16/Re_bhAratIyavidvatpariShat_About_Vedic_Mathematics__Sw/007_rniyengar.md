The book by Bag and Sen on sulba Sutras (INSA edition) is also pretty  
good. I know recently Subbarayappa has contributed a volume to the  
series edited by Chattopadhyay on history of mathematics and astronomy  
(I do not recollect the title correctly).  
About 'Vedic Mathematics' my observatioin is the problem is one of  
semantics. Bharati Krishna Tirtha's mathematics is Vaidika GaNitam,  
but not Vedanga GaNitam. Unfortunately in English it is dubbed Vedic  
Mathematics like Vedic Astrology. There could be other interesting  
number based codes and hidden meanings in the VEdic literature which  
formed the basis of development of Indian mathematics. For example the  
number 3339 that appears twice in the Rigveda (also in the Khila)is  
the 18 year eclipse period number associated with lunar eclipses. The  
Brahmanda puraNa expresses this number as the sum of three palynoms  
33, 303, and 3003, related to Somapaana. This number is correlated  
with the number of aksharas of RV in the Ashtaka format.  
(Late)Dr.Abhyanakar President of the Astronomical Society of India  
wrote a note in support of this work of mine. The articles are  
available at
