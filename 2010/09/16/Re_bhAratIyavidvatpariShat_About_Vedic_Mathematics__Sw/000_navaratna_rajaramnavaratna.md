Mr. Kapoor's books are distinguished by his devotion and enthusiasm but marred by dubious scholarship. Such works do more damage than good by undermining the credibility of the whole field.



 The best works on real Vedic mathematics, the *Sulbasutras* and ancient Indian mathematics remain the two volume *History of Hindu Mathematics* by Datta and Singh, and Datta's *Science of the Sulba, Ancinet Hindu Geometry.*



Also worth studyingare A.Seidenberg's two great articles on the *Sulbasutras* though his dates are all wrong*.* I have discussedthem in my book with Frawley, *Vedic Aryans and the Origins of Civilization* and compared them to Egyptian and Babylonian mathematics.



 What is needed is a systematic study of the *Sulbasutras* and their contribution to Harappan archaeology. Unfortunately Indian scholars don't want to undertake this kind of laborious work but later complain if someone else does and comes up with conclusions that conflict with their beliefs.
