Thank you very much for highlighting what I had omitted. I would include C.N. Srinivasa Iyengar's book on ancient Indian mathematics also, though small, it includes Kerala math.



We should refrain from making extravagant claims and lose credibility. Our heritage is great enough anyway, so we need only learn the facts.



Also, such claims do serious injustice to our great mathematicians of the pastlike Aryabhata and others like him. Were they so ignorant and insensitive to mathematics that they didn't notice this so-called Vedic mathematics lyingaround them? Did theworld have to wait 1500 years for us to discover these treasures?



Sincere regards,
