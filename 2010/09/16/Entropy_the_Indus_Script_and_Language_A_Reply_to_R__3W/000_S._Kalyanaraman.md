## Excerpts:

## 1Introduction

In a recent Last Words column \[[Sproat2010](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Sproat10)\], RichardSproatof the Oregon Health andScienceUniversitylaments the reviewing practices of "general science journals" after dismissing our work and that of \[[Lee, Jonathan, and Ziman2010](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Lee10)\] as "useless" and "trivially and demonstrably wrong." While we expect such categorical statements to have already raised some red flags in the minds of readers, we take this opportunity to present a more accurate description of our work, point out thestrawmanargument used in \[[Sproat2010](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Sproat10)\], and provide a more complete characterization of theIndusscript debate. A separate response by Lee and colleagues in this issue provides clarification of issues not covered here.

## 2TheIndusScript Debate

The Indus script refers to the approximately 4000 inscriptions on seals, miniature tablets, pottery, stoneware, copper plates, tools, weapons, and wood left behind by the Indus civilization, which flourished ca.2600-1900 BCE inSouth Asia. The existing inscriptions (see Figure[1](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#fig1)(a) for examples) are relatively short, the average length being 5 signs and the longest inscription on a single surface being 17 signs. The number of different symbols in the script is estimated to be about 400. This large number of symbols, coupled with archaeological evidence indicating extensive use of the script for a variety of purposes, ledscholarsto suggest that the script was probably alogosyllabicform of writing, each sign representing a word or syllable \[[Parpola1994](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Parpola94),[Possehl1996](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Possehl96)\].



In 2004,Sproatand colleagues published in the*Electronic Journal of Vedic Studies*an article whose title makes the unconditional pronouncement "The collapse of theIndusscript thesis: The myth of a literateHarappancivilization" \[[Farmer,Sproat, and Witzel2004](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Farmer04)\]. The article goes on to list arguments for why the authors believe that theIndusscript is nonlinguistic (the arguments are said to amount to a "proof" \[[Farmer2005](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Farmer05)\]). They propose that the script is a collection of religious or political symbols.



\[[Sproat2010](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Sproat10)\] states that their arguments "have been accepted by many archaeologists and linguists" without citing who these "many archaeologists and linguists" are. In fact, a number of respected scholars, not just those who have "spent most of their careers trying to decipher the symbols" \[[Sproat2010](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Sproat10)\], have voiced strong disagreement \[[Possehl2004](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Possehl04),[Kenoyer2004](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Kenoyer04),[Mahadevan2009](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Mahadevan09)\]. Several have published point-by-point rebuttals \[[Parpola2005](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Parpola05),[Vidale2007](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Vidale07),[McIntosh2008](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#McIntosh08)\].Parpola, who iswidelyregarded as the leading authority on theIndusscript, writes that the arguments ofSproatand co-workers "can be easilycontroverted" and goes on to expose the inadequacies of each of these arguments \[[Parpola2005](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Parpola05),[Parpola2008](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Parpola08)\]. McIntosh, in a recent book on the ancientIndusvalley, also discusses the evidence against the arguments ofSproatand colleagues \[[McIntosh2008](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#McIntosh08),pages372-374\].Vidale, a well-known archaeologist, notes that the paper \[[Farmer,Sproat, and Witzel2004](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Farmer04)\] "is constructed by repeatedly advancing hypotheses and sometimes wild speculation presented as serious scientific evidence" and concludes by saying: "I see no acceptable scientific demonstration of the non-scriptural nature of theIndussign system; therefore, I see no collapse of such 'thesis'" \[[Vidale2007](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Vidale07),page362\].

## 3Fallacies Resolved

Under a section entitled "The Fallacies," \[[Sproat2010](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Sproat10)\] describes a result from our article in*Science*\[[Raoet al. 2009a](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Rao09a)\] which presents evidence against the thesis of \[[Farmer,Sproat, and Witzel2004](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Farmer04)\]. In our article, we show that the conditional entropy of theIndusscript is similar to various linguistic sequences. The impression conveyed by \[[Sproat2010](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Sproat10)\] is that we are claiming such similarity by itself is sufficient to prove that theIndusscript, or indeed any symbol system, islinguistic. We do not make such a claim; instead, we only note in \[[Raoet al. 2009a](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Rao09a)\] that our result increases the evidence for the linguistic hypothesis, when one takes into account other language-like properties of the script (see detailed explanation in Section[4](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#inductive)below).



To set up his criticism of our work, \[[Sproat2010](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Sproat10)\] presents Figure1A from our*Science*paper but*never mentions*the results presented in Figure1B in the same paper. Nor does he describe our more recent block entropy result \[[Rao2010b](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Rao10a)\],even though he cites this paper (this new result extends the conditional entropy work). Both of these results include data from demonstrably nonlinguistic sequences, namely, DNA, protein sequences, and Fortran code. To present our work as "simple experiments involving randomly generated texts" is, to say the least, a gross misrepresentation of our work.

**…5****Comparison with Ancient Nonlinguistic Systems**

Sproatcontends that results such as the similarity in entropy scaling in Figure[1](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#fig1)(b) are "useless" without analyzing a sizeable number of "ancient nonlinguistic systems" \[[Sproat2010](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Sproat10)\]. As mentioned earlier,Sproatignores the fact that the results already include nonlinguistic systems: DNA and protein sequences (perhaps the two "most ancient" nonlinguistic systems!) as well as man-made sequences (Fortrancode and music in Figure[1](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#fig1)(b)).



We believe entropic results such as Figure[1](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#fig1)(b) to be both interesting and useful. An analogy may be apt here: If, in the dim surroundings of a jungle, you notice something moving and then spot some stripes, your belief that what is lurking is a tiger will likely go up, even though it could also be a zebra, a man wearing a tiger costume, or any of a number of possibilities. The observation you made that the object under consideration has stripes is certainly not "useless" in this case, just because you haven't ascertained whether antelopes or elephants in the jungle also have stripes! In other words, we now know that various types of symbol sequences, from natural sequences such as DNA and proteins to man-made systems such as music andFortran, occupy quite different entropic ranges compared to linguistic systems (Figure[1](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#fig1)(b); Figure 8 in \[[Schmitt and Herzel1997](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Schmitt97)\]). Given this knowledge, the finding that Indus sequences occupy the same entropic range as linguistic sequences, while not proving that theIndusscript islinguistic, certainly increases the posterior probability of the linguistic hypothesis, just as the observation of stripes increases the posterior probability of the "tiger" hypothesis in our example above.[²](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#tthFtNtAAC)As to where ancient nonlinguistic systems may lie among the entropic ranges in Figure[1](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#fig1)(b), we discuss this in the next section.

**6****Countless Non-Linguistic Sign Systems?**

Sproatand colleagues have stated that the properties observed in theIndusscript are also seen in "countless non-linguistic sign systems" \[[Farmer,Sproat, and Witzel2004](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Farmer04),page21\]. Let us consider some of these nonlinguistic systems \[[Sproat2010](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Sproat10),[Farmer,Sproat, and Witzel2004](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Farmer04)\]. Medieval European heraldry, Boy Scout merit badges, and airport/highway signs are not linear juxtapositions of symbols that can be up to 17 symbols long, as we find in the case of theIndusscript, nor do they exhibit a confluence of script-like properties as enumerated above. We invite the reader to compare examples of heraldry \[[Parker1894](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Parker94)\], Boy Scout badges \[[Boy Scouts of America2010](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Boyscouts)\], and airport/highway signs with theIndusscript sequences in Figure[1](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#fig1)(a) and judge for themselves whether such a comparison bears merit.



Another nonlinguistic system mentioned in \[[Sproat2010](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Sproat10)\] is theVinčasign system, which refers to the markings on pottery and other artifacts from theVinčaculture of southeasternEuropeof ca. 6000-4000 BCE.Sproatbelieves there is order in theVinčasystem and states that we "mis-cite" Winn. To set the record straight, here is what Winn has to say in his article in a section on Sign Groups \[[Winn1990](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Winn90),page269\]:



"Neither the order nor the direction of the signs in these (sign) groups is generally determinable: judging by the frequent lack of arrangement, precision in the order probably was unimportant…Miniature vessels also possess sign-like clusters (Figure 12.2j), which are characteristically disarranged."



This contradicts \[[Sproat2010](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Sproat10)\] and suggests that theVinčasystem, if it indeed lacks precision in the order of signs, would be closer to the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) range than to the linguistic scripts in Figure[1](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#fig1)(b). The actual amount of lack of precision unfortunately cannot be quantified in entropic terms because a large enough data set ofVinčasequences does not exist.



Sproatalso draws attention to the carvings of deities on Mesopotamian boundary stones known as*kudurrus*. He declares that our statement regarding*kudurru*deity sequences obeying rigid rules of ordering compared to linguistic scripts is "clearly false." To shed more light on this issue, we cite here the work of several scholars in this field.Slanski, in a recent in-depth study of the form and function of*kudurrus*, states \[[Slanski2003](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Slanski03),page163\]:



"Hierarchical deployment of the divine symbols. \[[Seidl1989](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Seidl89)\] observed that, to a certain extent, the divine symbols were deployed upon the Entitlementnarûs(*kudurrus*) according to the deities' relative positions in the pantheon. The symbols for the higher gods of the pantheon…are generally found upon or toward the top and most prominent part of the monument. Deities lower in the pantheon are deployed toward the bottom of the relief field."



A similar statement on the hierarchical ordering of symbols on*kudurrus*can be found in \[[Black and Green1992](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Black92),page114\]. The reader will probably agree that a system with even a rough hierarchical ordering among its symbols is more rigid than most linguistic systems. Linguistic systems have no such hierarchy imposed on characters or words, and there is considerable flexibility in where such symbols may be placed within a sequence. Therefore, as originally suggested in \[[Raoet al. 2009a](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Rao09a)\], we expect the entropy of the*kudurru*sequences to be lower than linguistic systems and perhaps slightly above the minimum entropy (MinEnt) range in Figure[1](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#fig1)(b). Again, the actual entropy values cannot be estimated because, as admitted in \[[Sproat2010](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Sproat10)\], a large enough data set of*kudurru*sequences does not exist.



\[[Sproat2010](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Sproat10)\] says that no one has done the "legwork" of putting together a large data set of ancient nonlinguistic systems. This ignores the work of \[[Vidale2007](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Vidale07)\], who did put together a set of 10 such systems.Vidalequestions the relevance of the nonlinguistic systems suggested bySproatand colleagues since they are neither of the same time period nor from the same geographical region as theIndusscript. To rectify this oversight,Vidalelists 10 nonlinguistic systems from Central and South Asia that were roughly contemporaneous with theIndusscript (Table 1 in \[[Vidale2007](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Vidale07)\]). For this set of much more relevant nonlinguistic systems,Vidaledemonstrates that the average number of different signs is only about 44, a far cry from the 400 or so signs in theIndusscript.



Are the kind of positional regularities found in theIndusscript also found in*countless nonlinguistic sign systems*\[[Farmer,Sproat, and Witzel2004](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Farmer04),page21\]?Vidalestates that the archaeological data lead us to question this "superficial claim" \[[Vidale2007](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Vidale07),page344\]. In the 10 nonlinguistic systems roughly contemporary with theIndusscript, positional regularities can either be "largely ruled out" (e.g., in potters' markings where signs occur mostly in isolation and rarely in couples) or the regularities take the form of "systematic, large-scale redundancy" (e.g., constant repetition of the same symbols). Such systems would fall roughly in the "Type 2" category of nonlinguistic systems suggested in our*Science*paper \[[Raoet al. 2009a](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Rao09a)\], lying closer to the minimum entropy (MinEnt) range in Figure[1](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#fig1)(b) than to the Indus script and linguistic systems.

**7****Implications of the Linguistic versus Nonlinguistic Hypotheses**

If theIndusscript does encode language, what might the content of the inscriptions be? A majority of theIndustexts are found on stamp seals (Figure[1](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#fig1)(a)), which were typically used in Bronze Age cultures for regulating trade. Seals were pressed onto clay used to seal packages of goods. Indeed, a number of such clay tags have been found at various sites in theInduscivilization, bearing seal impressions on one side and impressions of woven cloth, reed matting or other packing material on the other. These archaeological observations suggest that the short Indus texts on seals (Figure[1](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#fig1)(a)), like their other Bronze age counterparts, probably represent the contents, the origin or destination, the type or amount of goods being traded, name and title of the owner, or some combination of the above. Similar linguistic explanations can be found for the inscriptions on other media.



If, on the other hand, asSproatand colleagues propose, the script merely represents religious or political symbols, one is hard pressed to explain: (1) how and why were sequences of such symbols, with syntactic rulesentropicallysimilar to linguistic scripts (Figure[1](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#fig1)(b)), used in trade in a manner strikingly similar to other*literate*Bronzeagecultures? and (2) why did theInduspeople use these symbols in consistent sequences in their native region and alter their ordering when in a foreign land (Figure 1(c))? As pointed out by other authors \[[Mahadevan2009](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Mahadevan09),[Parpola2008](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Parpola08),[Vidale2007](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Vidale07)\], such incongruities are more the norm than the exception if one accepts the nonlinguistic thesis espoused bySproatand colleagues. The principle of Occam's razor then suggests that we reject the nonlinguistic hypothesis in favor of the simpler linguistic one.

**8****Conclusion**

A large number of identification problems are amenable to statistical tests, and represent perhaps the only way to solve these problems. Practical examples include separating email from spam and recognizing faces in digital camera images. Even though we may not have a perfect test for any of these problems, the statistical methods that are used can be quite useful, even if they are fallible (we all rely on spam detectors for email even if they occasionally let a spam email through; we do not discard these detectors as "useless"). An important goal of our work \[[Raoet al. 2009a](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Rao09a),[Raoet al. 2009b](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Rao09b),[Rao2010b](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Rao10a),[Yadavet al. 2010](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Yadav10)\] has been to develop better statistical tests for linguistic systems. As with other statistical tests, it would be foolhardy to expect that a single such test is infallible, as assumed bySproatand others in their quest to find "counterexamples" \[[Sproat2010](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Sproat10)\]. The observation that a single statistical test by itself is insufficient was the primary motivation for the inductive framework adopted in our research, where we apply a range of tests and estimate the posterior probability that an unknown sequence represents language (Section[4](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#inductive)).



In the concluding remarks of his Last Words column,Sproatsays it is not clear if editors of prominent science journals "even know that there are people who spend their lives doing statistical and computational analyses of text" \[[Sproat2010](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Sproat10)\]. We find such a statement surprising because it fails to acknowledge both the impressive achievements of the field of computational linguistics in recent years and the wide coverage of these accomplishments in the popular press (\[[Fletcher2010](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Fletcher10)\] and \[[Lohrand Markoff2010](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Lohr10)\], to give two recent examples).



Computational linguistics is playing an important role in our understanding of ancient scripts \[[Koskenniemi1981](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Koskenniemi81),[Knight and Yamada1999](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Knight99),[Raoet al. 2009a](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Rao09a),[Raoet al. 2009b](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Rao09b),[Yadavet al. 2010](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Yadav10),[Snyder,Barzilay, and Knight2010](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Snyder10)\]. Rather than representing a "misuse of the methods of the field of computational linguistics" \[[Sproat2010](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Sproat10)\], techniques from the field are providing new insights into the structure and function ofundecipheredscripts such as theIndusscript. For example, we now know that the kind of regularities found in theIndusscript can be exploited by statistical models to fill in missing or illegible inscriptions with most likely predictions \[[Raoet al. 2009b](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Rao09b),[Yadavet al. 2010](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Yadav10)\]. Recent n-gram analysis of theIndusscript has revealed that there are interesting dependencies between signs that go beyond just pairs of signs \[[Yadavet al. 2010](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Yadav10)\]. Additionally, these statistical models have allowed us to quantify the differences between Indus inscriptions found in West Asia and those found in theIndusregion (Figure[1](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#fig1)(c)), suggesting the script may have been flexible enough to represent different content or even a different language in foreign regions.



Indusscript research has benefited immensely from the application of ideas and methods from computational linguistics for almost four decades \[[Koskenniemi,Parpola, and Parpola1970](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Koskenniemi70),[Koskenniemi1981](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Koskenniemi81),[Parpola1994](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Parpola94)\]. We believe computational linguistics will continue to make important contributions toIndusscript research in the years to come.

## 1Introduction

In a recent Last Words column \[[Sproat2010](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Sproat10)\], RichardSproatof the Oregon Health andScienceUniversitylaments the reviewing practices of "general science journals" after dismissing our work and that of \[[Lee, Jonathan, and Ziman2010](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Lee10)\] as "useless" and "trivially and demonstrably wrong." While we expect such categorical statements to have already raised some red flags in the minds of readers, we take this opportunity to present a more accurate description of our work, point out thestrawmanargument used in \[[Sproat2010](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Sproat10)\], and provide a more complete characterization of theIndusscript debate. A separate response by Lee and colleagues in this issue provides clarification of issues not covered here.

## 2TheIndusScript Debate

The Indus script refers to the approximately 4000 inscriptions on seals, miniature tablets, pottery, stoneware, copper plates, tools, weapons, and wood left behind by the Indus civilization, which flourished ca.2600-1900 BCE inSouth Asia. The existing inscriptions (see Figure[1](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#fig1)(a) for examples) are relatively short, the average length being 5 signs and the longest inscription on a single surface being 17 signs. The number of different symbols in the script is estimated to be about 400. This large number of symbols, coupled with archaeological evidence indicating extensive use of the script for a variety of purposes, ledscholarsto suggest that the script was probably alogosyllabicform of writing, each sign representing a word or syllable \[[Parpola1994](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Parpola94),[Possehl1996](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Possehl96)\].



In 2004,Sproatand colleagues published in the*Electronic Journal of Vedic Studies*an article whose title makes the unconditional pronouncement "The collapse of theIndusscript thesis: The myth of a literateHarappancivilization" \[[Farmer,Sproat, and Witzel2004](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Farmer04)\]. The article goes on to list arguments for why the authors believe that theIndusscript is nonlinguistic (the arguments are said to amount to a "proof" \[[Farmer2005](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Farmer05)\]). They propose that the script is a collection of religious or political symbols.



\[[Sproat2010](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Sproat10)\] states that their arguments "have been accepted by many archaeologists and linguists" without citing who these "many archaeologists and linguists" are. In fact, a number of respected scholars, not just those who have "spent most of their careers trying to decipher the symbols" \[[Sproat2010](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Sproat10)\], have voiced strong disagreement \[[Possehl2004](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Possehl04),[Kenoyer2004](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Kenoyer04),[Mahadevan2009](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Mahadevan09)\]. Several have published point-by-point rebuttals \[[Parpola2005](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Parpola05),[Vidale2007](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Vidale07),[McIntosh2008](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#McIntosh08)\].Parpola, who iswidelyregarded as the leading authority on theIndusscript, writes that the arguments ofSproatand co-workers "can be easilycontroverted" and goes on to expose the inadequacies of each of these arguments \[[Parpola2005](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Parpola05),[Parpola2008](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Parpola08)\]. McIntosh, in a recent book on the ancientIndusvalley, also discusses the evidence against the arguments ofSproatand colleagues \[[McIntosh2008](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#McIntosh08),pages372-374\].Vidale, a well-known archaeologist, notes that the paper \[[Farmer,Sproat, and Witzel2004](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Farmer04)\] "is constructed by repeatedly advancing hypotheses and sometimes wild speculation presented as serious scientific evidence" and concludes by saying: "I see no acceptable scientific demonstration of the non-scriptural nature of theIndussign system; therefore, I see no collapse of such 'thesis'" \[[Vidale2007](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Vidale07),page362\].

## 3Fallacies Resolved

Under a section entitled "The Fallacies," \[[Sproat2010](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Sproat10)\] describes a result from our article in*Science*\[[Raoet al. 2009a](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Rao09a)\] which presents evidence against the thesis of \[[Farmer,Sproat, and Witzel2004](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Farmer04)\]. In our article, we show that the conditional entropy of theIndusscript is similar to various linguistic sequences. The impression conveyed by \[[Sproat2010](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Sproat10)\] is that we are claiming such similarity by itself is sufficient to prove that theIndusscript, or indeed any symbol system, islinguistic. We do not make such a claim; instead, we only note in \[[Raoet al. 2009a](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Rao09a)\] that our result increases the evidence for the linguistic hypothesis, when one takes into account other language-like properties of the script (see detailed explanation in Section[4](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#inductive)below).



To set up his criticism of our work, \[[Sproat2010](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Sproat10)\] presents Figure1A from our*Science*paper but*never mentions*the results presented in Figure1B in the same paper. Nor does he describe our more recent block entropy result \[[Rao2010b](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Rao10a)\],even though he cites this paper (this new result extends the conditional entropy work). Both of these results include data from demonstrably nonlinguistic sequences, namely, DNA, protein sequences, and Fortran code. To present our work as "simple experiments involving randomly generated texts" is, to say the least, a gross misrepresentation of our work.

**…5****Comparison with Ancient Nonlinguistic Systems**

Sproatcontends that results such as the similarity in entropy scaling in Figure[1](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#fig1)(b) are "useless" without analyzing a sizeable number of "ancient nonlinguistic systems" \[[Sproat2010](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Sproat10)\]. As mentioned earlier,Sproatignores the fact that the results already include nonlinguistic systems: DNA and protein sequences (perhaps the two "most ancient" nonlinguistic systems!) as well as man-made sequences (Fortrancode and music in Figure[1](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#fig1)(b)).



We believe entropic results such as Figure[1](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#fig1)(b) to be both interesting and useful. An analogy may be apt here: If, in the dim surroundings of a jungle, you notice something moving and then spot some stripes, your belief that what is lurking is a tiger will likely go up, even though it could also be a zebra, a man wearing a tiger costume, or any of a number of possibilities. The observation you made that the object under consideration has stripes is certainly not "useless" in this case, just because you haven't ascertained whether antelopes or elephants in the jungle also have stripes! In other words, we now know that various types of symbol sequences, from natural sequences such as DNA and proteins to man-made systems such as music andFortran, occupy quite different entropic ranges compared to linguistic systems (Figure[1](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#fig1)(b); Figure 8 in \[[Schmitt and Herzel1997](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Schmitt97)\]). Given this knowledge, the finding that Indus sequences occupy the same entropic range as linguistic sequences, while not proving that theIndusscript islinguistic, certainly increases the posterior probability of the linguistic hypothesis, just as the observation of stripes increases the posterior probability of the "tiger" hypothesis in our example above.[²](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#tthFtNtAAC)As to where ancient nonlinguistic systems may lie among the entropic ranges in Figure[1](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#fig1)(b), we discuss this in the next section.

**6****Countless Non-Linguistic Sign Systems?**

Sproatand colleagues have stated that the properties observed in theIndusscript are also seen in "countless non-linguistic sign systems" \[[Farmer,Sproat, and Witzel2004](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Farmer04),page21\]. Let us consider some of these nonlinguistic systems \[[Sproat2010](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Sproat10),[Farmer,Sproat, and Witzel2004](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Farmer04)\]. Medieval European heraldry, Boy Scout merit badges, and airport/highway signs are not linear juxtapositions of symbols that can be up to 17 symbols long, as we find in the case of theIndusscript, nor do they exhibit a confluence of script-like properties as enumerated above. We invite the reader to compare examples of heraldry \[[Parker1894](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Parker94)\], Boy Scout badges \[[Boy Scouts of America2010](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Boyscouts)\], and airport/highway signs with theIndusscript sequences in Figure[1](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#fig1)(a) and judge for themselves whether such a comparison bears merit.



Another nonlinguistic system mentioned in \[[Sproat2010](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Sproat10)\] is theVinčasign system, which refers to the markings on pottery and other artifacts from theVinčaculture of southeasternEuropeof ca. 6000-4000 BCE.Sproatbelieves there is order in theVinčasystem and states that we "mis-cite" Winn. To set the record straight, here is what Winn has to say in his article in a section on Sign Groups \[[Winn1990](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Winn90),page269\]:



"Neither the order nor the direction of the signs in these (sign) groups is generally determinable: judging by the frequent lack of arrangement, precision in the order probably was unimportant…Miniature vessels also possess sign-like clusters (Figure 12.2j), which are characteristically disarranged."



This contradicts \[[Sproat2010](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Sproat10)\] and suggests that theVinčasystem, if it indeed lacks precision in the order of signs, would be closer to the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) range than to the linguistic scripts in Figure[1](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#fig1)(b). The actual amount of lack of precision unfortunately cannot be quantified in entropic terms because a large enough data set ofVinčasequences does not exist.



Sproatalso draws attention to the carvings of deities on Mesopotamian boundary stones known as*kudurrus*. He declares that our statement regarding*kudurru*deity sequences obeying rigid rules of ordering compared to linguistic scripts is "clearly false." To shed more light on this issue, we cite here the work of several scholars in this field.Slanski, in a recent in-depth study of the form and function of*kudurrus*, states \[[Slanski2003](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Slanski03),page163\]:



"Hierarchical deployment of the divine symbols. \[[Seidl1989](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Seidl89)\] observed that, to a certain extent, the divine symbols were deployed upon the Entitlementnarûs(*kudurrus*) according to the deities' relative positions in the pantheon. The symbols for the higher gods of the pantheon…are generally found upon or toward the top and most prominent part of the monument. Deities lower in the pantheon are deployed toward the bottom of the relief field."



A similar statement on the hierarchical ordering of symbols on*kudurrus*can be found in \[[Black and Green1992](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Black92),page114\]. The reader will probably agree that a system with even a rough hierarchical ordering among its symbols is more rigid than most linguistic systems. Linguistic systems have no such hierarchy imposed on characters or words, and there is considerable flexibility in where such symbols may be placed within a sequence. Therefore, as originally suggested in \[[Raoet al. 2009a](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Rao09a)\], we expect the entropy of the*kudurru*sequences to be lower than linguistic systems and perhaps slightly above the minimum entropy (MinEnt) range in Figure[1](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#fig1)(b). Again, the actual entropy values cannot be estimated because, as admitted in \[[Sproat2010](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Sproat10)\], a large enough data set of*kudurru*sequences does not exist.



\[[Sproat2010](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Sproat10)\] says that no one has done the "legwork" of putting together a large data set of ancient nonlinguistic systems. This ignores the work of \[[Vidale2007](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Vidale07)\], who did put together a set of 10 such systems.Vidalequestions the relevance of the nonlinguistic systems suggested bySproatand colleagues since they are neither of the same time period nor from the same geographical region as theIndusscript. To rectify this oversight,Vidalelists 10 nonlinguistic systems from Central and South Asia that were roughly contemporaneous with theIndusscript (Table 1 in \[[Vidale2007](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Vidale07)\]). For this set of much more relevant nonlinguistic systems,Vidaledemonstrates that the average number of different signs is only about 44, a far cry from the 400 or so signs in theIndusscript.



Are the kind of positional regularities found in theIndusscript also found in*countless nonlinguistic sign systems*\[[Farmer,Sproat, and Witzel2004](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Farmer04),page21\]?Vidalestates that the archaeological data lead us to question this "superficial claim" \[[Vidale2007](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Vidale07),page344\]. In the 10 nonlinguistic systems roughly contemporary with theIndusscript, positional regularities can either be "largely ruled out" (e.g., in potters' markings where signs occur mostly in isolation and rarely in couples) or the regularities take the form of "systematic, large-scale redundancy" (e.g., constant repetition of the same symbols). Such systems would fall roughly in the "Type 2" category of nonlinguistic systems suggested in our*Science*paper \[[Raoet al. 2009a](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Rao09a)\], lying closer to the minimum entropy (MinEnt) range in Figure[1](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#fig1)(b) than to the Indus script and linguistic systems.

**7****Implications of the Linguistic versus Nonlinguistic Hypotheses**

If theIndusscript does encode language, what might the content of the inscriptions be? A majority of theIndustexts are found on stamp seals (Figure[1](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#fig1)(a)), which were typically used in Bronze Age cultures for regulating trade. Seals were pressed onto clay used to seal packages of goods. Indeed, a number of such clay tags have been found at various sites in theInduscivilization, bearing seal impressions on one side and impressions of woven cloth, reed matting or other packing material on the other. These archaeological observations suggest that the short Indus texts on seals (Figure[1](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#fig1)(a)), like their other Bronze age counterparts, probably represent the contents, the origin or destination, the type or amount of goods being traded, name and title of the owner, or some combination of the above. Similar linguistic explanations can be found for the inscriptions on other media.



If, on the other hand, asSproatand colleagues propose, the script merely represents religious or political symbols, one is hard pressed to explain: (1) how and why were sequences of such symbols, with syntactic rulesentropicallysimilar to linguistic scripts (Figure[1](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#fig1)(b)), used in trade in a manner strikingly similar to other*literate*Bronzeagecultures? and (2) why did theInduspeople use these symbols in consistent sequences in their native region and alter their ordering when in a foreign land (Figure 1(c))? As pointed out by other authors \[[Mahadevan2009](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Mahadevan09),[Parpola2008](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Parpola08),[Vidale2007](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Vidale07)\], such incongruities are more the norm than the exception if one accepts the nonlinguistic thesis espoused bySproatand colleagues. The principle of Occam's razor then suggests that we reject the nonlinguistic hypothesis in favor of the simpler linguistic one.

**8****Conclusion**

A large number of identification problems are amenable to statistical tests, and represent perhaps the only way to solve these problems. Practical examples include separating email from spam and recognizing faces in digital camera images. Even though we may not have a perfect test for any of these problems, the statistical methods that are used can be quite useful, even if they are fallible (we all rely on spam detectors for email even if they occasionally let a spam email through; we do not discard these detectors as "useless"). An important goal of our work \[[Raoet al. 2009a](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Rao09a),[Raoet al. 2009b](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Rao09b),[Rao2010b](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Rao10a),[Yadavet al. 2010](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Yadav10)\] has been to develop better statistical tests for linguistic systems. As with other statistical tests, it would be foolhardy to expect that a single such test is infallible, as assumed bySproatand others in their quest to find "counterexamples" \[[Sproat2010](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Sproat10)\]. The observation that a single statistical test by itself is insufficient was the primary motivation for the inductive framework adopted in our research, where we apply a range of tests and estimate the posterior probability that an unknown sequence represents language (Section[4](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#inductive)).



In the concluding remarks of his Last Words column,Sproatsays it is not clear if editors of prominent science journals "even know that there are people who spend their lives doing statistical and computational analyses of text" \[[Sproat2010](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Sproat10)\]. We find such a statement surprising because it fails to acknowledge both the impressive achievements of the field of computational linguistics in recent years and the wide coverage of these accomplishments in the popular press (\[[Fletcher2010](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Fletcher10)\] and \[[Lohrand Markoff2010](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Lohr10)\], to give two recent examples).



Computational linguistics is playing an important role in our understanding of ancient scripts \[[Koskenniemi1981](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Koskenniemi81),[Knight and Yamada1999](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Knight99),[Raoet al. 2009a](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Rao09a),[Raoet al. 2009b](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Rao09b),[Yadavet al. 2010](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Yadav10),[Snyder,Barzilay, and Knight2010](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Snyder10)\]. Rather than representing a "misuse of the methods of the field of computational linguistics" \[[Sproat2010](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Sproat10)\], techniques from the field are providing new insights into the structure and function ofundecipheredscripts such as theIndusscript. For example, we now know that the kind of regularities found in theIndusscript can be exploited by statistical models to fill in missing or illegible inscriptions with most likely predictions \[[Raoet al. 2009b](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Rao09b),[Yadavet al. 2010](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Yadav10)\]. Recent n-gram analysis of theIndusscript has revealed that there are interesting dependencies between signs that go beyond just pairs of signs \[[Yadavet al. 2010](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Yadav10)\]. Additionally, these statistical models have allowed us to quantify the differences between Indus inscriptions found in West Asia and those found in theIndusregion (Figure[1](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#fig1)(c)), suggesting the script may have been flexible enough to represent different content or even a different language in foreign regions.



Indusscript research has benefited immensely from the application of ideas and methods from computational linguistics for almost four decades \[[Koskenniemi,Parpola, and Parpola1970](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Koskenniemi70),[Koskenniemi1981](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Koskenniemi81),[Parpola1994](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/IndusCompLing.html#Parpola94)\]. We believe computational linguistics will continue to make important contributions toIndusscript research in the years to come.
