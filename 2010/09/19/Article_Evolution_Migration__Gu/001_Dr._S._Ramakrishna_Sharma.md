अभिवन्द्य,  

\>I am interested deeply in Sanskrit tradition, but my sorrow is no new  
scientific knowledge development is happening presently in the country  
along traditional lines.  

Keeping precisely this very observation in view, "Decoding Veda Vidya",  
a Three Day International Conference is being organized during in January,2011.  
(The Brochure is mailed to Sri R.N Iyengar separately.)  
About 36 Abstracts of the Papers received on different topics suggested during personal  
interactions with many scientists and scholars who have Samskrutam and  
Science background are being peer-viewed. The select 18 will be presented  
during the Seminar Sessions scheduled for two days(6x3=18 papers).  
  
There will be a Work Camp on Vedic Research Methodology after the Symposium  
on "Identifying Multidisciplinary Areas for Research and Development in Vedic  
and Traditional Resources".  
  
The Panel Discussion will be on " अनन्ता: वै वेदा:; अनन्तार्था:"  
The list of tittles of all the Abstracts/Papers will be posted in the Google Group:  
Foundation for Indian Scientific Heritage and also Bharatiya Vidvat Parishat.  
  
प्रणाम:
