thanks to Dr. Iyengar for detailed reveiw. this is the kind of reviw I expected from learned members.

one point that I am thinking (post artical 2010, it was published in 2009) is the timeframe described by the puranas. it seems that something has been cooked by wrong interpretation of jyotishagranthas. it is suggested by Pandit Ananta sharma, who is a very good puranic scholar (Sahitya peethadhyakshain JRRSU). he suggests that the chronology of kings does not suite the time desribed in purananas.

**my artical is the first step in this study** as stated in the article.anyway we have to go a long way before we can conlude it.

Institutional personal and inherited works we doon Nyaya and Vedanta have pose obstacle on my puranical studies. we hope for better.
