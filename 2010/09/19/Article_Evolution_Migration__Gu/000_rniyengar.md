Dear Members:  
I enjoyed reading the article. It presents a fairly detailed review of  
the traditional position using Puranas as the main PramaaNas. However  
I am concerned with the dismissive approach the article takes in  
several places. (P1. . as it is apparently absurd…) . The reflection  
of the concept of evolution in the Dashaavataara is metaphorical. If  
the Avtaras are to be taken in a literal sense a reasonable and  
verifiable historical time line has to be presented. I feel the phrase  
“Indian Tradition” does not convey any strict or unanimous meaning  
particularly in the context of criticizing the western mode of  
thinking broadly known as “Science”. Science does not claim to  
explain every question that the human mind may conjure up, but it  
proceeds on the basis of propositions, hypothesis, conjectures and  
verification. If a better theory or explanation or generalization is  
available scientists will have no hesitation in recognizing the same.  
Acceptance may take time but will happen in course of time. Galileo  
was accepted like this only. Newton’s physics was shown to be invalid  
at some time and space scales by Einstein. In the recent Current  
Science there is an interesting editorial “Trouble with Science”  
  
<http://www.ias.ac.in/currsci/10sep2010/553.pdf>  
  
Science does not insist that it is telling the last word, where as I  
am afraid the article by Dr.Pandurangi proposes that “Indian  
Tradition” knows all and the last word has been said about creation.  
Modern cosmologists do estimate the size and shape of the universe.  
I like to put forth a few points for the general consideration of the  
learned members of this group (Not about the article).  
1. Whatever are the strong and useful thoughts of Indian tradition  
they are recognized the world over (this includes the “children of  
Mcaulay”). For example: Ayurveda, Linguistics, Music, Numbers &  
mathematics and undoubtedly Yoga and spirituality.  
2. Puranas contain lot of useful information, perhaps not investigated  
properly. But just falling on a few lines here and there will not be  
convincing if proposed as logical thought. First and foremost  
“puraaNamityeva na saadhu sarvam” and we should not accept any  
statement without questioning. This includes the lengths of the  
Chaturyugas. Is this to be taken as history in the sense that the  
Talikota battle was in 1565 AD or India got independence in 1947? The  
long time lines of the Puranas are no doubt interesting in the sense  
Science proposes “geological time scales”. Unless a logically  
consistent historical timeline for the 18 puranas is developed by  
scholars, “Science” will always have the upper hand over “Indian  
tradition”.  
3. There is nothing like Indian Science and Western Science. Finally  
Science is non-dogmatic. It accepts logical approach subject to  
verifiability, repeatability. At present Science uses only the five  
senses for getting knowledge. But a time may come when ‘consciousness’  
or some other equivalent faculty gets included in the process of  
getting valid knowledge.  
4. The so called Indian traditional science subjects “Nyaaya,  
vaisheshika, Jyotisha-gaNita” have not grown along their respective  
developmental affinities in the last nearly 200 years. Nyaaya  
tradition accepts Yogi-janya-jnaana as valid. But no Naiyyayika has  
pursued this further to show scientifically verifiable results can be  
obtained along this line.  
5. Ingalls (from Harvard) in his book on Nyaaya clearly brought out  
mathematical logic was foreshadowed 100 years before Boole by the  
logicians of Navadvipa. The important message is “tradition” like  
water has to be flowing otherwise it becomes stale and newer  
generations will look at such knowledge as inferior. (Tragedy as far  
as “traditional Indian” science subjects are concerned).  
6. We are in a special time period as far as Indian culture/history is  
concerned. The discovery of Harappa, Mohenjodaro, Dholavira and the  
Indus-Sarasvati civilization has brought in new lines of thinking  
about our ancient history. But unfortunately “Indian Tradition” has  
had nothing important to say on this topic. I am not suggesting that  
there may be nothing, but no serious effort has been made by  
traditional Sanskrit scholars about investigating ‘historical/  
cultural’ links other than stating what is said in the Puranas.  
  
Excuse me for the long post. The message and the article encouraged me  
to pen down some of my thoughts and I thank Sri Pandurangi for this. I  
am interested deeply in Sanskrit tradition, but my sorrow is no new  
scientific knowledge development is happening presently in the country  
along traditional lines.  
  
With regards
