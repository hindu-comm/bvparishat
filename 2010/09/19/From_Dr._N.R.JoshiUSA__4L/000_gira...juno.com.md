Respected Scholars, Namaskar!

Dear Dr. Jasra Prasad, Thanks for inorming me about Varuna Yajnya for inducing rain. It worked. That is good news.

Dear Dr. Kalyanraman, I am sorry to present myself in a wrong way. Indian authors are not ignored. References to your work and of the other authors like Rajaram. B.B. Lal, S.R.Rao, Shrikant Talgeri and Dr. Narahari Achar are included in my book. I was talking about my power point presentation in which I have to present main points within limited time of say one hour at the most. There I use author from Ukraine for ancient Ukraine, author from Lithuania for ancient Lithuania,researcher for Hittite empire who did actual excavation in the modern day Turkey, Asko Parpola for ancient FinoYugric region, Arabian and African authors for ancient Arabia, Somalia and Ethiopia.Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
