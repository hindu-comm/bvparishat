Two points are missing in all discussions-(1) Whether Indian  
constitution was framed to protect rights of foreign invaders like  
Babur from Faraghana. (2) What is motive of sudden hurry before  
elections-Arun

\> \*Statement of Dr. Subramanian Swamy, President of the Janata Party. \*  

\>  
\>    The Report of the Liberhan Commission of Inquiry, unwittingly and  
\> ironically, supports the VHP’s case for a Ram temple in Ayodhya.  
\>  
\>    In Chapter 15 (Recommendations), Page 978, Para 176.5, the Commission  
\> states: “…..The question whether a structure was a temple or a mosque can  
\> only be answered by a scientific study by archaeologists, historians and  
\> anthropologists.” This is precisely the VHP’s stated position for the last  
\> 25 years.  
\>  
\>    The Allahabad High Court on VHP’s petition in the year 2002 got  
\> extensive investigation done at the disputed site through scientific GPR  
\> Survey and archaeological excavations. Vide orders, dated August 01, 2002  
\> and October 23, 2002, the High Court Bench asked the Archaeological Survey  
\> of India (ASI) to carry out Ground Penetrating Radar Survey/Geo-radiology  
\> Survey (GPR) of the disputed land, so as to ascertain possibility of proof  
\> of remnants of some earlier structure. In compliance of these orders, the  
\> ASI, with the help of Tozo Vikas International Pvt. Ltd. undertook this  
\> exercise.  
\>  

\>    The High Court thereafter \*suo moto\* passed a detailed order on March  

\> 05, 2003, issuing a commission to ASI to investigate into the matter by  
\> excavating the relevant area of the disputed land. The ASI took about five  
\> months in carrying out the excavation work and thereafter submitted a bulky  
\> report in two volumes together with 45 site notebooks, 12 albums containing  
\> 329 black & white photographs, 28 albums having coloured photographs, 11  
\> video cassettes, 6 DVD cassettes, registers of pottery, unsealed bones,  
\> architectural objects stored in tin-shed at the excavated site, individual  
\> list of 9 boxes containing bones, glazed wares, antiquities, day-to-day  
\> registers, antiquity register etc., etc..  
\>  
\>    In this excavation report (Ayodhya 2002-03, Vol.1 text, Chapter-X,  
\> Summary of Results, Page Nos. 268-269, 270, 271 and 272), the ASI states in  
\> the last paragraph: “…….Now viewing in totality and taking into account the  
\> archaeological evidence of a massive structure just below the disputed  
\> structure and evidence of continuity in structural phases from 10th Century  
\> onwards up to the construction of the disputed structure along with the  
\> yield of stone and decorated bricks as well as mutilated sculpture of divine  
\> couple and carved architectural members including foliage patterns, Amlaka,  
\> Kapotapali, Door Jamb, and semi-circular plaster, broken octagonal shaft of  
\> black schist pillar, lotus motif, circular shrine having Pranala (water  

\> chute) in the North, 50 pillar bases in association of a hue structure, \*are  

\> indicative of remains which are distinctive features found associated with  

\> the temples of North India.\*\*”\*
