Respected Scholars, Namaskar!

When I saw posting by Dr. Amba Kulkarni, I thought she will write something related to Computational Sanskrit since there was a posting saying something about computers and Sanskrit..The papers of NASA engineer Rick Briggs are from 1984. To the best my knowledge he did not publish on that subject after 1984 or 1985.Please correct me if I am wrong. One Shankaracharya Paramanand Bharati invited Rick Briggs to a conference in Bangalore. What happened next I do not know. Thanks. N.R.Joshi
