Respected Scholars, Namaste!

Finding World Cultures in Indian Scripture!

What Dr. S. Korad was saying in connection with borrowing by European countries the knowledge from the ancient India is true in the area of Phonetics. (See the book of Dr. Allen from England). It might be true in many other areas. However the western research goes ahead of borrowed materials quickly in developing new applications. Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
