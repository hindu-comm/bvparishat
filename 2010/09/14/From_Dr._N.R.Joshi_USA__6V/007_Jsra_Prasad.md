Respected Scholars,  
  
Namaste. Wanted to share a piece of information. Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam (TTD) has a practice of performing *Varuna japa* every year at Tirumala. Tirumala/Tirupati falls in the Rayalaseema region of Andhra pradesh which is well known for its scarcity of water. Last year, there was an यज्ञ organized by them in Hyderabad which had apparently witnessed good rains.  
  
I have forwarded a workshop circular in which benefits of agnihotra are being focussed.  
  
Thanks,  
Dr. Prasad
