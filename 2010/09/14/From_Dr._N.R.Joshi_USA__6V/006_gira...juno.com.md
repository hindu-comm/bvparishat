Respected Scholars, Namaskar!

Yajnya and Peace!

I am one hundred percent for all humans to follow the lofty principles described in their respective scriptures in order to bring peace in the world. I am for non-violence as preached by Mahatma Gandhi. The word Yajnya is used in different sense like "Jnyaana Yajnya", I am for that. In my article I used the word "Yajnya" from the point of view of Vaidika Yajnya -Ashvamedha or Raajasooya where Vedic Ris'is performing rituals. In that they use Vedic mantras. The question of mantras take us to the science of language-not only VyaakaraNa but meanings of the ancient Vedic words and terminology. The modern day Yajnyas do not work, I think, because we are missing something from this ancient science or rituals.

When in India, I visited the museum of "Vaidika Sanshodhan Mandala" Pune. Dr. Bhaagyalataa Paataskar was kind enough to explain to me the collection for more than an hour. In this museum, one sees Yajnya Vedees of different shapes, their purpose, different instruments  
for offerings to Agni, even instruments to kill animals, difference between Shrauta and Smaarta Yajnyas. And one sees here Sanskrit words and names never heard or read before. Research is required in order to understand the ancient logic behind mantras and their use. This is the research in language. That is why I am interested only the meanings of Sanskrit words. It also helps to create meaningful terminology (Anvarthaka Sanjnyaa) for modern English technical terminology (like-stochastic probability etc). This list has top level grammarians. I read their articles. But I have to limit my interests to meanings of SAnskrit words.

I have written about the book, "Semantic Powers" by Dr. Generi. The starting point of all discussions in Meemaansaa and Nyaaya was Vedic cannon and ritual importance. Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
