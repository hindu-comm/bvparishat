Respected Scholars, Namaskar!

I am delighted to read the article " Human Evolution and Migration-IN AND OUT OF INDIA" by Dr. Veeranarayan Pandurangi. I am thankful to him for quoting me in his article. I would like to make it clear that in my "Mahabharat-History or Myth" I am presenting archaeological evidence outside of the Indian subcontinent for possibility of the ancient Indians going towards the west. In short I am not contradicting Dr. Pandurangi. He presented evidence from scriptures. When I am standing in front of American audience, I , holding Ph.D. degree, have to be careful not guessing the evidence based on the ancient Indian books.

The starting point of my research was to find out whether Sanskrit (or Vedic) came to the Indian sub-continent from Iran (or from Ukraine as suggested by some European scholars). So I researched into the ancient history of all the countries in the west starting from Afghanistan. What I discovered is connection of Mahabharat to the western countries. In my power point presentation I present only concrete evidence presented by European archaeologists. I am not giving evidence by Indian authors. If I do that, outsiders will remark that you being of Indian origin, naturally inclined to accept the opinions of other Indians. So I present the data from European and American authors. That is the uniqueness of my presentation.

So sometimes when I raise questions about outside countries in connection with the ancient Indian history, it is for gathering information from scholars of this list. So please be patient with me because when I write about outside countries in connection with Mahabharat. Thanks.
