"I am not giving evidence by Indian authors. If I do that, outsiders will remark that you being of Indian origin, naturally inclined to accept the opinions of other Indians. So I present the data from European and American authors."

  

I am sorry, I do not understand why Indian authors should be ignored. What is so glorious about being European or American?
