## Archaeological site destroyed in Cambodia

September 7th, 2010  
  

Kent Davis posts some distressing news of a prehistoric circular earthwork site in Memot District, Kampong Cham Province in Cambodia that was levelled last week – without permission – to make way for temporary housing and development. Cambodian prehistory is not well studied, and the loss of a prehistoric site such as this represents a great and permanent gap in our knowledge of Cambodia’s prehistoric past.[Alison](http://alisonincambodia.wordpress.com/2009/02/27/circular-earthwork-sites/)has a great post about circular earthwork sites in Cambodia that you can read here.
