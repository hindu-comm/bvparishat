Respected Scholars, Namaskar!

Ancient India and Ancient Middle-East had history connection.

The name Ushana kavi also appears in the ancient history of Persia. Kavi related names are present in Paarashi population of India and outside. Luristan Bronzes (from Zagros mountain area) from the ancient Persia show Ashvini-kumar making Cyavan Rishi young. Thanks. N.R.Joshi
