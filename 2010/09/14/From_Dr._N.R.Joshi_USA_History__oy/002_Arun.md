'Kavi' means creator including creator of poetry or script in Vedas.  
Creation is by arranging matter in small pockets (kavala). 'Ushana'  
was called 'Kavi' as we have references of his founding works on  
medicine and grammer. He was in tradition of Bhrigu-varuni. Varuna was  
lord oof 'Yadasa' ='Taj' tribe of Arab who moved to Tajikistan later  
and there is a system of annual horoscope in India called 'Tajika -  
paddhati'. 'Varuna' was lord of west direction (Lokapala of west),  
lord of water or seas (Yadasam patir ap-patih - Amarakosha). He was  
also called 'Pashi' and his Pasha was famous as a weapon in Puranas  
and Ramayana. Any ruler is Pashi as he keeps persons of a country  
under his bondage. Even now, rulers in Arab region and Turky are  
called 'Pasha'. Varuna was overlord of all such 'Pashas'. As in  
Orissa, Kshatriyas are called 'Khandayatas' as they control (Ayatta)  
one Khanda. Overlord of all Khandas, is Indra called 'Akhandala'.  
Indra was lord (Lokapala) of east, so this word is in east part of  
India. Varuna was master of seas, so they were called 'Ocean' in name  
of 'Ushana'. Place of 'Kavi' is famous 'Kaba' of Arab
