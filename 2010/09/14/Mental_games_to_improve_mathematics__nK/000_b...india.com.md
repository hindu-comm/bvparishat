Respected scholars,  
  
For the last six years I am working as a private tutor of students of classes 9 to 12 and also for those preparing for certain entrance and recruitment examinations.   
  
I do not know the use of abacus. However I am yet to meet a person calculating with the abacus faster than the speed of mental calculation of Indian students qualifying in the IIT and other JEEs, CAT etc. I also do not know Vedic mathematics.  
  
On the basis of my own experiments and the experiments by some other tutors, I found that the following methods substantially improve the computational speed and accuracy of the students.  
  
1. Memorizing the multiplication tables thoroughly at least up to the table of 25.  
  
2. Memorizing all the formulas of algebra taught up to class 10 so as to use them for mental sums.  
  
3. Memorizing the squares of all numbers at least up to 25 and square roots of all the numbers at least up to 10.  
  
4. Practicing mental multiplication of any pair of two digit numbers (such as 67 x 93) using the formulas of algebra or otherwise  
  
5. Memorizing all the Pythagorean triplets up to 100 and using them for mental sums.  
  
What astonishes me is that while these techniques are used by many private tutors and private coaching classes, I have not seen any of the reputed public schools arranging games etc. for all their students based on these techniques.  
  
I think if any group of students of Japan, China, Europe etc. are able to do better than the Indians, it must be only because of the sincerity of the managements of their schools.  
  
With regards,  
  
Yours truly,  
  
D.D.Misra.
