A friend sent the following request:  
  
I am working on some history related painting and so it would be great if I could get these :  
  
1.Fashion Styles of Ancient India: A Study of Kalinga from Earliest Times to Sixteenth Century A.D. by R. P. Mohapatra  
  
2. Ear ornaments of Ancient India by Michel Postel  
  

It would be such a great help if any of you could find this :)
