Dear Sri Cibi Raj Singaravelu,

  

I believe the original thoughts are all from Veda Vedaangaas, in this case specially the study of aalaya vaastu, part of Vaastu Saastram. Based on this, Sri Ganesha Sthapati wrote and illustrated "Roopa Dhyaana RatnaavaLi", a treatise on how the various moortis need to be decorated, and their moola mantras which includes various ornaments. This is available in book form with a few people (I don't have it now), but it is available online with Scribe.com, I think. I will also try and obtain a copy and give a link if I can.

  

Regards,

  

Krishna Kumar Pillalamarri
