Yes Moti Chandra has several books on costumes alone: I have them, "The History Of Indian Costume From The 3rd Century A.d. To The End Of The 7th Century A.d." is interesting and I am reading them atm.  
  
The information about journal Marg is new to me, thank you ji.  
  
Since for the time being I am working only upto the 6th -7th centuries, i am not going into the Medieval costumes as of now, but this is a wonderful information for me ! will look into it. Thank you Professor !
