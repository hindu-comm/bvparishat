It may be noted that Manasollasa etc.are all compilations made in later period and are based on the then available corpus and hardly any new material could be found there.

  

Prof. Dr. Mahadev N. Joshi from Dharwad Uni. has done his Ph.D. on the Manasollasa under the able guidance of Prof. Dr. B. R. Modak and the book is already published.

  

There is another lady scholar from Andhrawho has written five books on different aspects of Manasollasa such as Sthapatya etc.I just forgot her name. She stays in Delhi and her husband is an Advocate and if I remember correctly,she worked in the Archaeological Survey of India.
