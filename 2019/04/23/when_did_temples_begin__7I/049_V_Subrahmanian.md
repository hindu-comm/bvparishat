Just to inform that the above in the Ramayana is seen from a different angle by Sri Appayya Dikshita in his रामायणतात्पर्यसारसङ्ग्रहस्तोत्रम् - in the very second shloka, in explaining it, he says, citing the Valmiki Ramayana:

Before entering Agasthyashrama, Rama says to Lakshmana: 'Here, Devas, Rishis, Gandharvas, Siddhas, etc. meditate upon the great tapasvin Agasthya. Here, devas, naagas, etc. practicing severe austerities, are stationed, to worship Dharma.'

  

After Rama, etc. enter the Ashrama, Valmiki reports enumerating the various entities that are having 'sthaanam-s' there. Valmiki's statement from the Uttara Ramayana also is cited here to show the greatness of Agasthya who are worshiped by Devas, etc. whom Agasthya can even liberate. After citing these Appayya Dikshita concludes that the non-mention of Shiva is to show that Shiva is not among the entities that worship Agasthya.

  

From the above we can gather that a 'sthaanam' for a 'deva' (and others) need not necessarily be places of worship of those 'deva-s' etc. stationed there (at least in those times, in a different yuga), but where the deva-s etc. reside with a view to worship someone else. I have not read these portions of the Ramayana to determine whether someone from Agasthya's hermitage was offering any kind of puja in these 'sthAnam-s'.

  

Maybe we can even extrapolate that the places given to Garuda, Hanuman, etc. in Vaishnava temple is to signify that the former are worshiping the main deity in the temple, such as Rama, Vishnu, Narasimha, Krishna,. and also receive worship from devotees who revere these 'bhaagavata's' who are in immaculate service to their Lord.
