Dear friends,

I would discourage people to jump to the dictionaries.

Words are living objects and have their contextual use.

Please use context in literature to analyze, please do  

not isolate the word from the context. This is where the  

western translators go totally erratic. Most words are not labels.  

Best regards,

BM

  

(Lately I learn that the arbitrary word translation began by the Jesuits

in their zeal to translate Bible in local languages as they encountered.

Arabs apparently were careful in this respect.)
