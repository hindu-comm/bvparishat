मन्दिरम् , आलयःetc. as laakshanikaprayoga can refer to देवमन्दिरम् , देवालयः etc. , as such can be used as a rough / loose equivalent of the English 'temple'.

  

---------------------------------------------------

  

Let us distinguish the semantics including etymology of temple and related Sanskrit and other Indian language words

  

from the

  

practices/ culture in a temple or its Indian /'Hindu' parallels (synchronic / ahistorical view)  

  

from the

  

history of a temple or its Indian /'Hindu' parallels (Diachronic view)

  

the three can be related and can be discussed in a related way, but the discussants do well to point out the distinctions and connections that they make.

  

None of these is 'what is the use ?' type relative to the other.
