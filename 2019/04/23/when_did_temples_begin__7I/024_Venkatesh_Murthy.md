Namaste

  

If Bhasa thought temples were there in Bharata's time he will write about temples in Pratima Nataka. Otherwise not. It means temples existed much before Bhasa. Tulsidas did not write about canons in his Ramayana even though canons were there and used in Tulsidas time in First Battle of Panipat. Why? Because he knew it was not possible. Rama and Vanara Army could not have used canons. Similarly Bhasa will write about Bharat visiting temples if he knows it was possible in Bharata's time.
