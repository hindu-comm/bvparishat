Thanks for sharing an article that supports my ideas on multi stream origins.

Saskia-ji's book:

  

In chapter II

  

Function and Form of the Devadas Tradition within the Temple Ritual in Tamilnadu

  

Under the subtopic Ritual Performance,

  

Under the sub-head

  

b.The temple,

  

She classifies temples into

  

1\. Indigenous temple

  

2\. Agamic temple

  

3\. Royal temple

  

4\. Pilgrimage temple

  

She then moves to

  

C. Temple ground and object of ritual performance,

  

She has

  

1\. Vedic symbolism in the temple ground

  

2.. Homology between the human body and the temple on the basis of Yogic traditions

  

3\. Vastupurushamandala

  

4\. Divine symbiosis

  

Her discussion though in her framework, is based on previous work , till this part.

  

But her main contribution is mainly in discussing the whole issue taking the specific ground plans of specific temples in Tamil Nadu and explaining the whole theme in terms of live traditions of the temples focusing more, of course, on Devadasi performances as part of the ritual performances in the temple.

  

Such a discussion brings support to the theory of origins in Vedic tradition through specific cases and live practices.
