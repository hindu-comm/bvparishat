Dear Dr B V K Sastry avare,

  

What do you want to say?

  

1\. No historical approach to this question? Focus only on the use of the structures and systems that are being referred to as 'temples' here? Only synchronic study rather than diachronic study ?

  

or

  

2\. No use of the word 'temple' ?

  

a\. Use only a native word ? Word such as Koil, Mandir, Devasthaana, Gudi ?

  

b\. No non-Sanskrit word? Only a Sanskrit word?
