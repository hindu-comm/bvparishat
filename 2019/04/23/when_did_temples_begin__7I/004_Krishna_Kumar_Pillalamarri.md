The Vaastu Saastra, which itself is a Vedanga, has 'Aalaya Vaastu' - temple architecture - as a part. The renowned Ganapati Sthapati has written extensively about it, and has illustrated how Vaastu is directly related to 'Purusha'. The aalaya vaastu describes the various components of an aalayam, from Garbha Gudi to Dvaara Gopuram as components of purusha from head to feet. In fact, 'Aalayam' means that which has 'Laya'. This part of vaastu Saatra also describes the Murti as being a form of Adi Taalam. (in maatras as related to the form of the vigraham). The Garbha Gudi is a form of Daharaakaasam which represents the Cosmos. Sri Ganapati Sthapati has also laid out how this is to be mathematically to be viewed. Very logical. I urge you to read it. It makes it clear that temples have been there in Vedic times, and the temple architecture directly relates to Paramatma. This leads me to believe everything in Sanatana Dharma is an integral whole, with a holistic approach between different sciences.
