Interestingly, Kunchan Nambiar (kuñcaṉ Nampyār; 1705 – 1770 CE) speaks of the antics of drunk Nairs and of Paṭṭars (Tamil Brahmins) fleeing
the scene of war when describing the devāsura yuddham (the war between devas and asuras) in the heaven. But that is in a very humorous vein in his satirical / humorous poetry in Malayalam. Be it devaloka, earth or pātāḷa the landscape is that of medieval Kerala populated by Namboodiris, Nairs, Pattars and all such castes.

Radhakrishna Warrier
