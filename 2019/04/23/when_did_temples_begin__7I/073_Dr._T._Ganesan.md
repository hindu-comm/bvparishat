In the ancient Pasupata system especially in the Pasupatasutra-s the  
word आयतन is generally used to denote a temple \[of Siva\] as in this  
sutra: आयतनवासी ।  
  
Even in some of the Saiva\[siddhanta\] Agama-s usage of the word आयतन
for  
the temple is more common.  
  
As far as I know the word मन्दिर is totally absent in these texts.
