Dear Prof Pandurangi,

I think we should distinguish between मूर्ति as a cosmic manifestation versus

मूर्ति as an artificial creation. It is the latter which would be a product of assembly

and technology. The massive work cited by Varahamihira on glues, resins

and grouts could be a part of technology development. Like all knowledge books,

Varahamihira possibly compiles the existing knowledge (though he does not

mention sources like Panini does). Varahamihira is dated at 6th century

(post-Aryabhatta). Monolithic stone statues are a part of carving technology

(dated to 3rd century BC), but artificial stone enclosures would need glue.

Ellora rock cut temple is dated 5th century. Earlier enclosures of mud bricks

(Mohenjo daro) and wood have not survived.

So the question could be the construction time of artificial stone enclosures

where an artificial मूर्ति (with stationary रूप) is installed. For larger structures,

we need iron bar technology as evidenced by iron pillar in Delhi (dated 4th century).  

So is my thought.

Regards,

BM
