Namaste

  

There is a detailed description of Rukmini, along with her friends,
going to and worshiping at the Durga temple on the eve of her slated wedding with Shishupala. The Bhagavatam gives a detailed account of this, her visiting the various shrines there, etc.

  

In Grihya sutras, if I remember right, there are mantras and vidhana for pratiShTha of devataa murti-s.
