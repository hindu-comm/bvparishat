Dear scholars,

Was there any discussion in this group on when the temple building began in our culture? The Vedas do not seem to have talked about their existence at that time. Ramayana too does not mention the word 'devalaya' but it mentions the word 'chaitya' which has different meanings. I am not sure whether it includes the temple. For instance, in 6-127-2 on learning about Rama's return, Bharata issues instructions to organize worship to all gods in chaitya-s relating to gods.

There is a view that the mantra itself was like a temple to the deity in the Vedic days. Later it became a yantra, which again developed into some activity called tantra. Thereafter some small symbol, pratika seems to have started. Some innovative artist started making the pratika in an artistic manner to make it an idol. This sounds reasonable to me.

Is there any study on this?
