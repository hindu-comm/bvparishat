On the contrary, on careful reading-

1\) Bharata is surprised to see the deva-sthana was worshipped with some (crude) vidhi-s.

2\) The deva-sthana is doubling up as yAtri-vishrAma. Even today we find such places all over India.

3\) Understanding the light weight worship associated with such places, Bharata offers a mere praNAma.

4\) अमंत्रार्चितदैवतः is associated with the place, not the deities.

  

Re Appaya Dixit:

 I didn't know that deva-s also worship humans in Hinduism. Even then, the point is the asymmetry of Shiva vis a vis other deities in Agastya's ashrama, which is evident. Agastya is, moreover, not a sectarian figure.
