Veda itself is visual-rich and as such promotes visual arts. As I've already admitted, both yAga and murty-devotion have been standard ways of worship (since time immemorial).  
At the same time, yAga has been the most obvious and effective way to approaching non-Shaiva deities.  
This exception is evident in the example cited from Ramayana in this thread: Shiva not mentioned as having a deva-sthana in a yAga dominated ecosystem of Rshi Agastya.  
This also suggest, as pointed out by other scholars here, that deva/devi-sthana is to be seen as distinct from temple.  
Temple and Agama (its science) are (genetically) related. It is also observed that Shaiva-agama-s contain (seemingly more original) vidhi-s that were (apparently) adopted by Vaishnava-agama-s Vaikhanasas and Pancharatra, but not before struggling between themselves as to how much of Vaidika vidhi-s each had to forego in order to "catch up" with the temple trend.  
Agama-s, of Kaliyugi origin (mentioned in late Mahabharata), have difinitely not been there since time immemorial; this is also seen in the discomfort felt by several luminaries (of arguably more Vaidika bent) in the past towards Agama-s.  
I'll maintain that worship of non-Shaiva deities in a temple is OK but indirect in the sense that Shiva "forwards" the prayer to the destination.
