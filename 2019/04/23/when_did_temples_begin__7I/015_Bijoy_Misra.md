That appears a late document, possibly 4th century AD or later.

Varahamihira talks baout *vajralepa*, the weatherproof grouting technology

I alluded in a different note.

i would request people to try these out in laboratories than just reading

texts. Your knowledge in Sanskrit could be useful to the laboratory

technologists. There could be new technology waiting. Glues are important

and their testing is important. As we see the technology did not move to

Cambodia and the big stone structures collapsed.
