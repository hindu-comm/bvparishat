चैत्य also means चौराह in Ramayana; perhaps a monument erected at intersection or having intersection of four (lines) in its architecture.  

  

This may not be strictly true. I would think that the चैत्य existed in central locations like city squares or possibly a square

develops through the traffic coming to the चैत्य.  

We such centralized चैत्य even now, which could exist before the roads.  

  

I had commented not to rely on dictionaries too much. I find the old authors

are very precise in their expression. I wish it continues.
