Yes, I agree. Without a proper definition of what we mean by "Temple" the question about 'when' can not be properly discussed. I propose that temple should be defined as a built-up enclosure wherein Divine Presence is invoked for the benefit of worship by the general public. Private places of worship (including Yajna/Yaaga/IshTi etc) must have existed since the remote past. Confluence of Vedic and Agamic ideals must have given rise to a social ecosystem that sprouted Temples. Bhaasa's Pratima-naaTaka (*c* 300 BC) has a built structure for ancestors of Bharata (including Dasharatha), but this can not yet be called 'Temple'.
