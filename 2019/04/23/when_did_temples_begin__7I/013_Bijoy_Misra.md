One has to define the word "temple" properly.

"Temple" as a place of worship is different than a "temple" with an installed deity.

The latter would need the creation of the deity and the technology to construct a structure.

Valmiki talks about "Chaitya"s which could refer to designated locations for ritual or worship.

No deity or shrine is mentioned. "Chaitya"s were possibly had some presence with masonry

since they are destroyed by Hanuman in Lanka. We see such stone based structures in Sarnath.

A stone structure would need cutting the stone and grouting. While clay deities (mUrtti) might have  

been used in early times, evidence of stone carving seems like post-300BC. The rock cut temples  

would possibly be through the Buddhist masons in Ajanta.

i visited Kamakhya two years ago. It is a sacred cave with a Devi installation. A cave being used

as a place of worship could be very old.

"Temple" as a stone enclosure with an entrance necessarily has to be rock-cut.
