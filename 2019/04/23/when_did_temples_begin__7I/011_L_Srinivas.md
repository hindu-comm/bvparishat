\>Origins in the Buddhist structures such as Stupas

  

One of the gifts of European scholarship to India is that if it existed in Buddhism, 'Hinduism' copied from Buddhism. This is strictly scholarship of the retired ICS, Colonial administrators, merchants and factors of the East India Company variety.

  

In modern India, scholars have severely criticized such linear models of cultural development. For example, during the British period, it was a holy truth that all apsidal temples were originally Buddhist. All the apsidal temples to Siva, Vishnu etc were not only constructed following Buddhist models but were actually originally Buddhist temples which Brahmanical Hinduism had captured, as it were. So went the orthodoxy which repeated ad nauseam by the so called Indian scholars too, that is those that plied their trade in English.

  

With this nice linear model, not only was the image of a gentle Buddhism perpetrated, an image of Buddhist victimhood and aggressive intent of Hinduism (read 'Brahmins') was also projected for all posterity. This is not only ridiculous but should not be repeated in this day and age.

  

The last nail in the coffin of Buddhist origin of apsidal temples (and ergo, at a remove, of all temples) has already been driven once and for all, by Himanshu Prabha Ray. Please see:

This is a Katherine Mayo wannabe tour of the devadasi institution in pre modern south India. What does this have to do with the original question?
