I have been reading this discussion. But have been wondering as to what fruitfulness emerges from all the discussion.

It comes to mind that one can consider that a मन्दिरम् is a part of evolution of a sociological need and in turn would merit to be considered as a social institution. Since "man is a social being", as sociologists propound,

  

I became curious to understand the dictionary-meaning and etymology of the word. Here is what I got in Apte's dictionary =>

"...मन्दिरम् \[मन्द्यते$त्र मन्द् किरच्\] A dwelling house, habitation, place, mansion; प्रावेशयन्मन्दिरमृद्धमेनम् Ku.7. 55; Bk.8.96; R.12.83; मणिमयमन्दिरमध्ये पश्यति पिपीलिका छिद्रम् Subhāṣ.**-2**An abode, a dwelling in general; as in क्षीराब्धिमन्दिरः.**-3**A town; विनिक्षिप्य बलं सर्वं बहिरन्तश्च मन्दिरे Rām.6.12.3...."

  

Since the quotation \<विनिक्षिप्य बलं सर्वं बहिरन्तश्च मन्दिरे Rām.6.12.3\> is from श्रीरामायणम् can we say that the concept of a मन्दिरम् did exist in Valmiki's times ? How old is that ? In कृत or सत्य युग, i.e. going backwards on the time-line - much earlier than कलि, द्वापार, त्रेता?

  

Maybe, मन्दिरम् has been a sociological need of the human race, ever since the race began or evolved !

  

Actually does not the etymology \<मन्दिरम् \[मन्द्यते$त्र\]\> say it all ?
