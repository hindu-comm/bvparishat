I have been to Purnagiri in Uttrarakhanda a few times, where a portion of Sati-devi's body is believed to have fallen. That sure is a place of worship, but the statue placed there is a modern one. In Kedarnath, the linga may have been worshiped long before the temple was built.

  

So we have to differentiate between places of worship where gods and goddesses dwell, but have no statues, and temples where statues are enshrined. But I am not sure if both of these places can be labelled देवतायतनः ।
