Hello Namasete,

  

Respected Scholars the topic is very interesting and defined nicely.

As I known Sthapatya Veda which is an Upa Veda of Atharva Veda, this upa Veda details with Vastu shastra (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vastu_shastra>) and also explains different types of construction.

  

Thanks for sharing nice information.

  

Hari Om

Thanks
