There are two models of explaining the origins of Hindu temple currently:

  

1\. Origins in the Buddhist structures such as Stupas

  

2\. Origins in the Vedic rites/ rituals mainly Yajnas

  

The third model that did not receive much attention and I would like to draw attention to is the contribution of the folk culture to the amalgamation of Vedic-folk that we call 'Hinduism' today

that was discussed with the currently outdated simplistic name 'Aryan-Dravidian' that was based only on linguistics based on the IE and Dravidian language families as the only two language families

and was almost always discussed in terms of only a simplistic conflict relationship and not a more nuanced and intricate Vedic-folk inter-cultural continuum model that covers continuities and discontinuities both between Vedic and the multiple folk and tribal cultural streams.

  

If 'idol worship' and temple tradition in the folk and tribal traditions are agreed to be autochthonous and a 'pure' 'original' 'early' Vedic culture is modelled /reconstructed as devoid of 'idol worship' and temple tradition , the present 'idol worship' and temple tradition in 'Hinduism' needs to be viewed as contributed by folk and tribal traditions only.

  

But the model #2 above namely Origins in the Vedic rites/ rituals mainly Yajnas, when taken together with the model of contribution from the folk and tribal traditions, provides a more comprehensive and more nuanced understanding than the existing simplistic models.

Matsya Purana deals with elaborate aspects of temple design:

  

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matsya_Purana#Temple_design>

  

The*Matsya Purana*, along with the texts such as Brihat Samhita, are among the oldest surviving texts with numerous sections on temple, sculpture and artwork designs.^([\[26\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matsya_Purana#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKramrisch197646,_133-134,_140-141,_161_with_footnotes-26)[\[27\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matsya_Purana#cite_note-BharneKrusche2014rht-27))The Purana describes 20 styles of Hindu temples, such as Meru, Mandara (later Mandir) and Kailasa designs.^([\[28\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matsya_Purana#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKramrisch1976161-28))The text lays out guidelines on foundation, spaces within the core temple where people visit, and then the spire (*Vimana*or*Shikhara*).^([\[27\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matsya_Purana#cite_note-BharneKrusche2014rht-27))

[![The text asserts square grid as ideal for a Hindu temple, discussing 8x8 squares grid mainly, but smaller 3x3 floor plan as well (above). The Matsya Purana in other chapters presents its theories on layout of towns and public works such as water reservoirs.\[29\]\[30\]](https://ci5.googleusercontent.com/proxy/XxeWdEBbPACzDqdNjzaAlIiC_CQ6cgl5lAu4L_DuepiVlSsqtjsxc2wCtZegA_cTrXYv5ARIi1m5-hlR713GM7s5ptvdlfnF6hm057fB1nGIPvYZ_n-Gi0NxNOHxrumkV0eoFvev5GxcBeEgThGCZRrnm_j4pwarrjbYlSmMQumNOvR6b1uCsKqOElHH3PUzg8xBUPB6imahECakbbR-f1arTPkOw4UyWpznt9wAQNznBTSEO3zrmpC0guwsk4blCTIWaZ_vRIn9yxr9UL6a1crvrRexuww0c_uJd-9h97700GiBcE9uWyRc6gL0roxnGoQaT6pKnlzajcb_5Q=s0-d-e1-ft#https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/9_Grid_Pitha_Mandala_Hindu_Temple_Floor_Plan_Vastu_Purusa_Mandala_Architecture.svg/260px-9_Grid_Pitha_Mandala_Hindu_Temple_Floor_Plan_Vastu_Purusa_Mandala_Architecture.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:9_Grid_Pitha_Mandala_Hindu_Temple_Floor_Plan_Vastu_Purusa_Mandala_Architecture.svg "The text asserts square grid as ideal for a Hindu temple, discussing 8x8 squares grid mainly, but smaller 3x3 floor plan as well (above). The Matsya Purana in other chapters presents its theories on layout of towns and public works such as water reservoirs.[29][30]")

The text asserts square grid as ideal for a[Hindu temple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_temple "Hindu temple"), discussing 8x8 squares grid mainly, but smaller 3x3 floor plan as well (above). The*Matsya Purana*in other chapters presents its theories on layout of towns and public works such as water reservoirs.^([\[29\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matsya_Purana#cite_note-29)[\[30\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matsya_Purana#cite_note-30))

The text highlights the square design principle, suggesting that the land and design of large temples be set on 64 squares (mandala or yantra),^([\[31\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matsya_Purana#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKramrisch197646-47_with_footnotes-31)[\[32\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matsya_Purana#cite_note-B%C3%BChnemann2003mny-32))and numerous other square grid designs such as the 16 square grid smaller temple.^([\[32\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matsya_Purana#cite_note-B%C3%BChnemann2003mny-32))A temple's main entrance and the sanctum space should typically open east facing the sunrise, states the text, while the human body was the template of the temple, with Atman and Brahman (Purusha) as the resider in the heart, respectively.^([\[27\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matsya_Purana#cite_note-BharneKrusche2014rht-27)[\[33\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matsya_Purana#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKramrisch197625-26,_88-89_with_footnotes-33))The relative ratios, of various levels and various spaces, which the text asserts are naturally pleasing, such as those of entrance height, lengths and heights, placement of carvings are specified in chapters 253-269, as well as other sections such as chapters 58-65.^([\[34\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matsya_Purana#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKramrisch197646,_133-134_with_footnotes-34)[\[27\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matsya_Purana#cite_note-BharneKrusche2014rht-27))For example, the text suggests that the pillar inside the temple (stambha) be considered as of nine parts, with terms such as Padma, Kumbha, Antara and others, wherein the width of the pillar and each of these parts have certain ratios, and the structural features or carvings be laid out on these nine parts.^([\[27\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matsya_Purana#cite_note-BharneKrusche2014rht-27))The text, though named after an avatar of Vishnu, has numerous sections on the installation of Shiva[Linga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linga "Linga"), while other chapters mention Vishnu[murti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murti "Murti"), goddesses and other deities.^([\[35\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matsya_Purana#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKramrisch1976271-275_with_footnotes-35))

The design guidebooks embedded inside the*Matsya Purana*were likely suggestions, and not binding on those who sponsored or built the temples, states Michael Meister.^([\[32\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matsya_Purana#cite_note-B%C3%BChnemann2003mny-32))However, field evidence suggests that the 1st-millennium Hindu temples across India, ones that have survived into the modern age, did adopt the square principle and the architecture approximately follows the general principles mention in old texts such as the*Matsya Purana*.^([\[32\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matsya_Purana#cite_note-B%C3%BChnemann2003mny-32))

  

The composition of the text may have begun in the last centuries of the 1st-millennium BCE, and its first version complete by about the 3rd-century of the common era, asserts Ramachandra Dikshitar – known for proposing ancient dates for Indian literature.^([\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matsya_Purana#cite_note-FOOTNOTERocher1986199-4))Other scholars, such as[Pandurang Vaman Kane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandurang_Vaman_Kane "Pandurang Vaman Kane"), place the earliest version of the text to between c. 200–500 CE.^([\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matsya_Purana#cite_note-FOOTNOTERocher1986199-4)[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matsya_Purana#cite_note-sbhardwaj67-11)[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matsya_Purana#cite_note-12))

It is not prudent to imagine that such an elaborate design discussion could have entered the book without a sufficiently long history of temple construction before that.
