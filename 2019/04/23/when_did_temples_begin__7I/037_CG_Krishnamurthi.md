नतोऽस्मि विदुषः

  

There is a Vaasudeva temple (now only the pillar remains) built by the (Greek) Bhaagavata Heliodorus in 2nd century B.C.E., in the ancient city of Vidishaa (current M.P.) and possibly the oldest Sanskrit /Brahmi stone inscriptions in the pillar. Some info...<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliodorus_pillar>This is certainly an old temple - anyone can visit the site. (I have visited).
