क्रियामाधुर्यं पाषाणाम् would not necessarily mean a carved statue.

There are many places which are naturally beautiful.

I mentioned about Kamakhya in a previous note.

  

To my mind, the question is development of technology. The logic would be that technology

would not exhibit in isolated places. In our group here, a woman brought a conjecture that

Ajanta frescoes were not isolated, all homes and buildings were decorated with the frescoes.

The homes and buildings were made of wood and do not exist any more. I accept the view.

We can think of similar frescoes in Valmiki's description.  

Metal craft and metal statues are cited though by Valmiki (Kaikeyi's palace). We have  

archaeological evidence in Indus time. This can be produced through lost wax technique  

which does not need tools to create shapes.

  

Please do look for references and evidences. This helps in reconstruction.

  

Thank you.
