Namaste Paturi Garu



1. On \< what do you want to say \> - My request was to highlight
the importance of caution to be exercised in debates using English translation terms for Samskrutham vocabulary, which in this case

happened to be \< ' Temple'> debated in a framed context of ' Ramayana' onwards'. The fuzziness and theological overtones of the
meanings associated with the English term' temple' do not 

sync with the responses presenting historical footprints of ' devataa- deva poojaa - deva sthana ( sanctioned and sanctified under Aagama rules)- the deva aagaara / praasaada' in Bhaarat.



2. In sanatana Dharma sampradaya, every veda sukta is associated with ' devataa'; and vaidika worship is ' devataa- poojana/ aaraadhana/ upaasanaa'.

Every devataa has a deep connection with Veda/ Mantra.



 In Bharateeya sampradayas there are two traditions, where the inherent premise is ' that 'devataa has a roopa and can be visioned- visualized -represented (= saakaara upaasanaa).



 One stream is 'deva/ devataa- poojaa' in the frame work of
'deha-devaalaya ( Body as the house of Divine)'. This is 'antar-yoga', esoteric worship.



 Second stream is 'deva/ devataa- poojaa' in localized structures with or without 'praana-pratishthita - pratimaa-roopaka'
which carry the nomenclature 'deva-Sthana / kshetra / aagaara / aalaya'.

This stream provides the historical, cultural, technological ( vastu, chitra-karma-sutra, daaru karma, vastra, aabharana, construction material, icons, et al) footprints.



 The texts like Ramayana, Mahabharata, Bhagavata, Puranas, aagama works provide the justifying/ supporting material for both streams. The texts coming in different historic time periods, carry the

same thread of ' Devataa-Yoga' in unified way. 



 My effort was to make a gentle pointer to the shifts that are seen in the academic studies which seem to explore a path which disrupts the integrity of ' devataa-poojaa-sampradaya' which may result in
painting a history of Bharath in a way 'it was not'. 



3. The extreme end of first stream is seen in some schools which present ' Devataa aaraadhana in a ' formless mode'. ( The statements
from Mahabharata (05-45) and Yajrveda like 'na sandrsuhe tishtati roopamasya..' are used preferentially in Arya samaja institutions. { ( Mahabharata 05-45) - (<http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/mbs/mbs05045.htm>
- The typos of text are horrifying on the web page and needs proofing). When Gita 17 - speaks of ' deva-dvija guru-prajna poojanam'
( Gita: 17-4 ) there is already the clarity on 'deva- pooja' with form and localized way. the word ' brahmana -devataa, bhoo-sura' endorses this.



In this background, the word 'temple' does not map to the concept of ' Deva- mandira /aalaya -sthana' in any sense of etymology, theology, historicity, structural -localized models. Therefore, it is necessary to contemplate deeply before asking/ responding to a question like '' When did the Temples Begin' - ? in the context of Bharateeya sampradaya.
