It may be very difficult to pinpoint a single corresponding meaning to "temple", "or shrine".  

  

The place of worship may be a पीठम् (for example places where parts of Sati-devi's body fell became the ones, perhaps स्थानम् conveys a similar concept ), a आगमगृहम् (especially related to tantric puja where only the persons having the specific dikshya are allowed to enter), a
आलयम्where public in general are allowed in ( the people may or may not be allowed to personally touch statue or even enter the sanctum sanctorum), and this discussion may throw light on other names.
