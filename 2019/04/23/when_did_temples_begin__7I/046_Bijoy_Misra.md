We should distinguish between the two concepts देवस्थानम् and देवालयः

देवस्थानम् could be very old - rivers, trees, mountains, sea, caves - the characteristics

could differ through imagination. To designate a देव for the देवस्थानम् is possibly a jump

in thinking. Construction of the देव would be a function of technology, a symbolic pile

or a simulated human. The time scales on these development could be large.

On the other hand देवालयः would be a technology construction product where some  

cosmological speculation of design like enclosure, confinement, seclusion is inherent.

The selection of location of a देवालयः would also have astrological calculations

which are different developments in technology.

The translation literature is extremely sloppy with these.
