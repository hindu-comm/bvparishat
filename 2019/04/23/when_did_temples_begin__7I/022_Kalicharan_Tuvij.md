Namaste.  
  
Shastra is very clear regarding the Vaidika basis of temple, or temple-worship vidhi-vidhAna.  
  
The next important question, to my mind, is: where this alternative mode of worship (that is, alternative to यज्ञ) coming from?  
  
Should one ascribe this, for want of thought, to "Jana" / folk mode of worship?  
This would be doing huge injustice to the depths of Vaidika dharma.  
By an in-depth study of यज्ञ-of-Daksha episode one may resolve this problem.
