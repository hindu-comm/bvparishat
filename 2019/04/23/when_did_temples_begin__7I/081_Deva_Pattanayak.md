I look forward to the opinions and analysis of Sanskrit scholars in this forum and elsewhere to put forth the etymology of the word "mandir". Please avoid native vs foreign overtones as well as unnecessary personal diversion.

As a scientist I thought the word "mandir" in Sanskrit is somehow related to mind and continued looking at the etymology of mandir in google and was sweetly surprised.

By the way in Odisha where there exists a large number of very old temples interwoven everywhere in the landscape mandir plays an important role to pacify the inner self and people go to mandiras to seek peace of mind.

ps: In Odia vowel is mostly added at the end of a consonant, perhaps to soften the sound and mandir is pronounced as "mandira".
