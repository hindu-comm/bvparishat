Namaste



1. This thread of discussion is focused on the physical reality of ' Temple', considered linguistically equal to the Samskruth term ' Devalaya / Mandir' ! What is the utility-benefit ( viniyoga- as Dr. Yadu

keeps insisting) of the deliberations on historicity of ' Devataa - aaraadhanaa :: God worship in public space ? Memorializing a place ? Symbolizing a place with an event related to a scripture

narrative ?

The responses have provided valuable data and information on Ramayana related ' Devalaya/ devataa worship in social public space as an institution of physical existence-reality- a continuing

culture backed with sanction of Veda- Aagama and the like'.
***But then have we reviewed what does the word 'Temple' itself stands for ? ***

******



2. Below is an extract from the link
<https://www.dictionary.com/e/mosque/> . The pick is in the context of 9-11 tragedy. The public debate of 2011 was on ' What to build at the Ground Zero' ? 

***TITLE***: ***What is the exact meaning of “mosque” (and “temple” and “church” while we’re at it)?***



**Debate is easy, and yelling is easier. How often, however, do people examine their most basic knowledge?**



Right now, the proposed construction of an Islamic worship center in relative proximity to “Ground Zero” in Manhattan is a nexus of conflict and emotion. ***The missing ingredient is definition***. Let’s examine basic terms, starting with mosque.



All the variants of “mosque” in European languages go back to the Arabic masjid, “a place of worship.” But masjid derives from the Arabic sajada, “to bow down in prayer.” Dig into the origins of “Muslim” and “Islam” and a common theme emerges: both words relate to the Arabic aslama, “to accept, surrender, or submit.”



“Church” comes from the Greek kyriake, “the Lord’s house,” with kyrios meaning “ruler” and oikia “house.” **Temple is based on the Latin templum, “a piece of ground marked or cut off for worship.” Temno in Ancient Greek is the first person verb form “I cut.”**



After investigating all three terms, we are struck by a distinction between mosque and the other two terms for places of worship. **Whereas the words temple and church have a fairly broad meaning and origin, mosque has a quite specific meaning. The name of the faith (Islam) the name of a member (Muslim) and the name of the place of worship (mosque) all relate directly to its main tenet, submission to God.**



A possible explanation for this consistency is the unique history of Islam in relation to the two earlier abrahamitic faiths, Judaism and Christianity. Islam incorporates a specific response to Judaism and Christianity and actually includes figures such as Moses and Jesus. Also, compared to the other monotheistic religions, the texts of Islam have a clearer history of attribution, allowing for greater consistency in the terminology and expression of its concepts.



To conclude and bring our look at the Ground Zero mosque controversy full circle, let’s focus on the phrase “Ground Zero.” Before the term came to refer to the area of former World Trade Center towers, it already resonated with destruction and loss. Here are two definitions:

1.The point on the surface of the earth or water directly below, directly above, or at which an atomic or hydrogen bomb explodes.

2.Informal. The very beginning or most elementary level.





3. **The take home point is straight and simple: Ask the Right Question with the appropriate terms !**

****

** The very debate of ' Temple in Ramayana period' is providing an implicit acceptance and validity for the concept of 'Temple' as valid equivalent for 'devalaya/ devaayatana' concept. **

**And this goes further down to a tacit acceptance of
hypothesis ' Concept 'God' is equivalent across all the 'religions' ( Because Hinduism is a Religion like other religions). **

****

 This is NOT the ground reality- Either by historicity, Theology, Philosophy, Language and Cultural continuum of Practices.



**Therefore, what should be the appropriate way of asking the
question ' When did the Temples Begin' - ? in the context of
Sanatana Dharma / Hinduism ? **

****

**It is a question for the Language- Translators / Dictionary Makers (Samkrutham to English /English to Sanskrit ) to debate and provide a right solution. **

****

** What If, if there is no equivalent popular word, existing usage, or technical concept? What would be the the right approach ?
**

**Language Scholars need to GO FOR EXERCISE OF NEW WORD CONSTRUCTION IN ENGLISH , rather than promote debate with INCORRECT USE -MISUSE- ABUSE OF A TERM .**

** And next follow up question would be - where is the precedent for this ?! -**

** For English, follow the url: <http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~kemmer/Words/wordtypes.html> ; For Samskruth, follow Panini. **
