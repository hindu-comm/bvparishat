For details about my specific contributions, please go to google scholar for my papers, patents and presentations.

My sankalpa is to find relationships between our current scientific theories and technologies and those described in the Vedas and Upanishads and ancestral scriptures. Four years of sanskrit at the high school as a special paper is helpful now in this endeavor.

  

I am fortunate to have been introduced to language research by Dr. Bijoy Misra, a member of this august forum and also the founding president of India Discovery Center, Lincoln, MA. Bijoy and I studied together in the same class at Ravenshaw College Cuttack from 1964-1966. I am grateful to him for this.

  

I thank the moderator of this group Nagraj-ji for accepting me as a member of this group. I have benefited from the discussions on this group.

  

Hope this is a sufficient introduction about me. I request all to write to me privately if they have any question or comments and spare the group from personal reactions which will not be much use.

  

Arvinda-ji asked a very relevant and specific question about the origin of "temple building in our culture". He stated that there was no mention of temples in the Vedas.

  

To me by temple he meant "Mandir", like the Jagannath Mandir. Tirupati Mandir etc. Bhubaneswar is known as the temple city because there are literally hundreds of mandirs including the famous Lingaraj mandir. In Odisha mandir is also known as deula. To me mandira is related to mana or mind. Inside Jagannath mandir there is a pavilion where my father used to take me when I was young and asked me to sit there quietly. There was no god or goddess there. I heard recently from the Sadguru that people in the past used to go to temple not to pray but to seek truth. I think early mandirs were places where people went to find solace and connect to cosmos and nature and be one with everything everywhere.

  

Gradually in temples, deities were worshipped with strict ritual practices. Temples acquired commercial overtones and many gods and goddess were installed to maximise income for the kings and owners. Interestingly in most of these places of worship(temple), there still exists pavilions for people to sit down and connect to cosmos as a remnant of practices done during the Vedic period.

  

Like Aravinda_ji I hope this group will identify the oldest "temple building in our culture".

  

Thank you for reading and

  

Namaste,
