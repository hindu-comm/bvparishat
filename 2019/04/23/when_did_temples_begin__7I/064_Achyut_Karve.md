History and Etymology for temple

Noun (1)

  

Middle English, in part going back to Old English tempel, templ, in part borrowed from Anglo-French temple, both borrowed from Latin templum "space of sky or land delimited orally by an augur, piece of ground used for taking auspices, sacred precinct, building consecrated to a deity," of uncertain origin

  

NOTE: Latin templum has been traditionally derived from the Indo-European verbal base tem- "cut" (see TOME), on the assumption that the original templum was a space "cut out" by the augur; the suffix would presumably be -lo-, with the -p- secondary. Greek témenos "sacred precinct" has been compared. More recently templum as been associated with a putative \*temp- "stretch, extend," assuming a further sense "measure" (see TEMPO); the templum would then be a space "measured" by an augur.

  

Noun (2)

  

Middle English, borrowed from Anglo-French, going back to Vulgar Latin \*tempula, altered (with conformation to the suffix -ula) from Latin tempora, plural (taken as feminine singular) of tempus "side of the forehead, temple," of uncertain origin

  

NOTE: On the assumption that Latin tempor-, tempus "time" meant originally "stretch, extent" (see TEMPO) tempus "temple" has been taken as a semantic bifurcation of the same word, the temple of the head being the place where the skin is stretched tightly against the skull. Compare Old Norse þunn-vangi, Old High German dunnwangi "temple," literally, "thin-cheek."
