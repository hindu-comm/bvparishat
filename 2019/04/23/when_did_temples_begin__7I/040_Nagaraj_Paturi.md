Open-air shrines where an idol is worshipped without a shelter are abundant throughout India. Some of these gradually get a shelter and develop into big structures. In the case of these where no shelter is built and the temple is left as n open-air one in spite of huge crowds of bhaktas visiting it, there are legends about the deity asking for leaving him/her just that way without a shelter and in some cases attempts to go against such a wish of the deity failing and leading to adverse consequences.

  

In the case of south Indian village goddesses /mother goddesses or ammans or ammaa avars or amma vaarus, the minimum essential of a temple is a Neem tree and a 'Navel Stone'. In some cases, there is a non-classical or naive idol/sculpture of the goddess without a shelter placed under this Neem tree. In some of these some, a small short shelter is built around this sculpture/idol. Some of these shrines with or without a shelter get 'classicalised' /classicised , the folk/naive sculpture getting replaced by aagamic /s'aastreeya /stylised vigraha and a bigger and sometimes a very huge aagamic temple replacing the small shelter. The Neem tree is usually protected during this transformation.

  

In some major kshetra temples where we see a Kadamba or some other tree protected, the origins of the temple could be in a Kadamba grove or a grove of some other trees.

  

We may trace the origins of many temples to such natural environs.

  

The south Indian word gudi for temple has its origins in kuti meaning bamboo shelter.
