This issue of culturally , for that matter religiously loaded English equivalents of native terms(globally) and /or Indic terms (In India) being used in our English communication about native concepts(globally) and /or Indic concepts (In India)is well taken and can never cease to be current and hot.

  

Fortunately , diligence in these matters, of scholars discussing Indic concepts in English is growing day by day.

  

Most of the participants in this thread have shown that due diligence.

  

While that care is in place, it doesn't hurt to use some of these terms for the convenience of lingua franca.
