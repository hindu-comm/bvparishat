This is regarding the mail from Subrahmanian ji,

Regarding the reference to Swami Ranganatha, it is not from the Ramayana. It is from the Padma purana as quoted by Govindaraja in his notes on 6-231-85. The sloka merely says *labdhvA kula-dhanam .* Govindaraja says that the word kula-dhanam meant Sriranga-vimanam as per the sampradaya. He further quotes from the Uttarakanda and also from the Padmapurana. Reference to Rangasaayi actually comes in Padmapuranam. In the Uttarakanda it is merely mentioned as Jagannatha. However Rama cannot give the kuladaivam twice to Vibhishana. The quote from the Padmapurana says:

इत्युक्त्वा प्रददौ तस्मै इक्ष्वाकु-कुल-दैवतम्।

श्रीरङ्ग-शायिनं स्वार्चमिक्ष्वाकु-कुलदैवतम्।

It is surprising that Sriranganatha was the kuladaivam for Rama.

Probably an inference can be drawn that the Uttarakanda was a later addition and not by Valmiki.
