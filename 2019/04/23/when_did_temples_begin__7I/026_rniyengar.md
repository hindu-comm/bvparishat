If my example satisfies scholars I am happy. However I am a little bit cautious about extrapolation to'Stone idols' etc. Nevertheless I agree

Bhasa knew about such places. But then देवकुल, देवागार\`, देवगृह , देवकोष्ठ are attested in many other BCE texts. That is why a mutually acceptable definition is a prerequisite.

Bhasa is unparallelled in describing contemporary society and culture of his days. It is rightly said
