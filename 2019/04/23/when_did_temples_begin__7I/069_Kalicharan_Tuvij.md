मन्दिर can be the correct contemporary word for "temple", helped by its original meaning (subject to your correction) "an inhabited place": like we usually say, "he is going to Kashi-Vishva-natha", etc - in the sense "he is going to the place-inhabitated (मन्दिर) by the deity Kashi-Vishva-natha".  
  
In that way, one would see मन्दिर founding its most important meaning in a late age, Kaliyuga, along with genetic relations with parvata-like shape, garbha-grha, and Agama vidhi-s.  
  
In earlier yuga-s, when Agamas and temples didn't exist, one should still hope to find their proto-forms if indeed in Vaidika framework the "proto-Shiva-saiddhantika modes" coexist with यज्ञ in a mutually consistent way.  
  
So we have चैत्य. This word is given by some (कल्पद्रुम likely) "from चिता" ('mound'), and चिता has relations as we know - from our texts - with both Shiva and Shudra-s.  
  
Valmiki Ramayana:  
शैल इन्द्रम् इव गन्ध आढ्यम् द्वितीयम् गन्ध मादनम् \|  
अशोक वनिकायाम् तु तस्याम् वानर पुम्गवः \|\| ५-१५-१५  
स ददर्श अविदूरस्थम् चैत्य प्रासादम् ऊर्जितम् \|  
मध्ये स्तम्भ सहस्रेण स्थितम् कैलास पाण्डुरम् \|\| ५-१५-१६  
The चैत्य in the middle of Ashoka-Vatika here is compared to both Kailasha-parvata and Gandha-Madhana-parvata. So Valmiki through poetry does make the connection with parvata.  
  
चैत्य also means चौराह in Ramayana; perhaps a monument erected at intersection or having intersection of four (lines) in its architecture.  
  
Again, in Ramayana, चैत्य यूप has a mention.  
  
Prima-facie then, चैत्य-यूप gave way in Kaliyuga to मन्दिर-शिवलिङ्गम् (and then to any मन्दिर) within religion, and to चैत्य-स्तूप within secular strains.  
  
To conclude, मन्दिर can be seen as the culmination of चैत्य. Not everything, it seems, comes to be bad in Kali age. मन्दिर-s have single-handedly supported dharma (and an appreciable chunk of its pantheon) in a time devoid of यज्ञ.  
  
P.S.  
(देव-)आयतन in traditional thesaurus is given as: विश्रामस्थान, as well as देवस्थान. So देवस्थान seem to be different than मन्दिर.
