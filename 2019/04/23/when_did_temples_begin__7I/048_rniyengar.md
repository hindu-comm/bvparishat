Sorry for the delayed response. Perhaps I should have made the definition more rigorous. Yes, Bhaasa mentins about the beauty of the sculpted "Pratimaa", the drama is named as Pratimaa. Technically Bhaasa refers to सादृश्य ofthe idol to Dasharatha. This is portrait sculpting. It appears in Bhaasa's time this was an established practice but did not continue. In the Svapnavasavadatta there is reference to identifying the heroine in disguise through a portrait painting. There are a few instances in the literature of such cases. Portrait painting gained importance thro' western influence the best example being by Ravivarma. But afaik in temples this concept of सादृश्य never existed. It is symbolism that is extolled. The power in the symbol is either natural or through प्राणप्रतिष्ठ. Without this mystical process of invoking the presence of the Devata, I don't think a building with an image/idol/icon will be a Hindu Temple. To the extent I know (corrections requested) शालिग्राम शिला is Vishnu and no specialप्राणप्रतिष्ठ is required. So also with Svyambhu-linga. The word Linga itself originally meant 'symbol' : some discriminating character/ mark/function. In the SkaandaPuraana there is mention of linga of Shiva falling from the sky, which can be correlated with Meteorite. Hence my hesitation to take the building that Bharata is made to visit by Bhaasa as not देवस्थान (in the sense of a symbolic icon infused with प्राण) but पितृस्थान.

I believe, as I ndicated earlier, Bhaasa knew about the Hindu Temple. His date is not exactly known, 300 BC is just an educated guess.

The form and content of our temples is a fascinating subject for engineers, philosophers, social reformers, and historians to understand the relevance of Temples in stabilizing and continuing the practice of Dharma.

Thanks

RNI
