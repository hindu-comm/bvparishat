Intuitively, I wrote that "To me mandira is related to mana or mind.".

I found by googling the following:

  
Before I begin, I would like to mention that the study of etymology or[Nirukta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirukta), one of the six[Vedanga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedanga), can provide beautiful insights into the practice of*Hinduism*. As you read further, this will be showcased.

This seemed like a simple question at first. Although, I needed to a lot of research to get the etymology of it. There are two aspects of the question that I cover:*Word roots both in and out of sync with Hinduism, Timeline of word usage and Hinduism.*

## **Word roots**

There are two main viewpoints on the word root that I have come across.

*A faulty interpretation by Monier Williams:*

*Monier Williams*in his[A Sanskrit-English Dictionary, etymologically and philologically arranged](https://archive.org/details/1872sanskriten00moniuoft)says that the word*mandira*according to some is said to be from the verb root*mand*.

Each word in Sanskrit language can have multiple meanings. The verb*mand*means - to become drunk or inebriated,*to be glad, to rejoice, to exhilarate, to be praised, to be celebrated, to praise*, to sleep, to languish, be languid, to move slowly, tarry, loiter, hesitate, stand still, pause,*to be beautiful, to shine*.

The current context context in which the noun*manda*is used in Hindi is to refer to a mentally slow person. In my opinion, Western scholars show a biased lens towards such interpretations, sometimes due to a lack of understanding of the culture as they are an outsider and sometimes due to faulty intentions. To subscribe the meaning of the word*mandira*to the word*manda*which has a lot of negative interpretations makes no sense. (Although, it has a lot more positive interpretations too).

*An interpretation in sync with Hinduism:*

Sadly, there are not many Indian Sanskrit scholars whose etymological work is famous (atleast, not in my notice). The second interpretation comes from*Krishna G. Rampa*l in his book[Sacred Structures: Artistic Renditions of Hindu Temples in Malaysia and Singapore](https://books.google.co.in/books?id=J4FGDtbgHB0C&pg=PA69&lpg=PA69&dq=Sacred%20Structures:%20Artistic%20Renditions%20of%20Hindu%20Temples%20in%20Malaysia%20and%20Singapore&source=bl&ots=On7zMlALOC&sig=vx43KtOgsA7SQBeAKx8jNZzFS5Y&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiNvOPSr7LMAhWMHo4KHWkbDMIQ6AEINDAG). He writes:

> **The word*mandira*is derived from the words*man*which symbolises > inner-self and*dir*which means a dwelling place. In > several*Hindu*texts, the Lord is described as one's "inner-self". > A*Hindu*temple can be a separate structure or part of a building. > Most practising*Hindus*maintain an altar at their homes for daily > worship and meditation.** >
> This interpretation makes much more sense. I would like to add to > this. The word*mandira*can be seen to originate from the > words*manas*and*dhiraya*. The word*manas*means - imagination, > intention, mind, spirit, mood, perception, intelligence, desire, > thought. The verb*dhiraya*means - gets comfort, is > encouraged.*dhiraya*in Sanskrit can be seen as the root of*dira*in > Hindi .***Hence, mandira means a place where the mind gets comfort, > intelligence and imagination is encouraged.***

The above meaning have been taken from[Samskrita Sabdartha Kaustubha – A Sanskrit-Hindi Dictionary](https://www.google.co.in/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwi0u5bBtLLMAhWDCY4KHQPsBpcQFggbMAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sanskritebooks.org%2F2010%2F11%2Fsamskrita-sabdartha-kaustubha-sanskrit-hindi-dictionary-dp-chaturvedi-1928%2F&usg=AFQjCNG5yHgBQnzOXgCRwqEVwF-YDTcLUQ&sig2=ETK9ejTBRFWAfrPC3wf2jA&bvm=bv.120853415,d.c2E)by*Dwarikaprasad Chaturvedi*. (I have translated the Hindi words to English for the convenience of the readers).

  

Here is what I found on the word "temple" from Merriam_Webster dictionary

  

## History and Etymology for*temple*

Noun (1)

Middle English, in part going back to Old English*tempel, templ,*in part borrowed from Anglo-French*temple,*both borrowed from Latin*templum*"space of sky or land delimited orally by an augur, piece of ground used for taking auspices, sacred precinct, building consecrated to a deity," of uncertain origin

NOTE:Latin*templum*has been traditionally derived from the Indo-European verbal base*tem-*"cut" (see[TOME](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/tome#etymology)), on the assumption that the original*templum*was a space "cut out" by the augur; the suffix would presumably be*-lo-,*with the*-p-*secondary. Greek*témenos*"sacred precinct" has been compared. More recently*templum*as been associated with a putative*\*temp-*"stretch, extend," assuming a further sense "measure" (see[TEMPO](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/tempo#etymology)); the*templum*would then be a space "measured" by an augur.

So temple and mandir do not seem to have any correspondence with each other in an intrinsic sense. The englishman simply translated mandir as temple ( a place of worship).
