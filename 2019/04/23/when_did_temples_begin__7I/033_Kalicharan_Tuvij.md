Prakash ji,

  

 My reference to Daksha'syajñawas along these lines (not able to expand due to lack of time):

  

 1) Shiva being a deity having an uneasy relationship withyajña.Rudra stuti in Veda samhita is a testimony to this, widely understood by scholars.

  

 2) Shiva has direct connections with jagata (this is simply the way of reality), as mother Parvati is his own wife.

  

 3) It is not that Shiva can't be worshipped via yAga, or it is not that non-shaivite deities can't be worshipped via temple route : it is all about the most natural or direct way of doing something.

  

 4) The main conclusion is : shivAlaya = temple prototype.

  

 5) Being able to worship non-shaivite deities via temple is still courtesy the power of Shiva. An ancient corroboration: Vietnamese Shiva-lingam that has Vishnu & Brahmaa bhAga-s built in it.

  

 6) Shiva-lingam sees the universe as Mother's womb, where Shiva projects into as a Linga form.

  

 7) Temple is then a logical extension (in a parvata form, courtesy pArvatI) around Shiva-lingam. And that's where "garbha-grha" comes from.

  

 8) Since the start of Kaliyuga (traditionally, after 3000 BCE), Shudra-s have for the most part led our civilisation and being largely Shaivites they invested in the science of temple building. Around the world, this is also the time pyramid (parvata, or kailAsha form) construction started.

  

 My apologies again for not doing justice to these bullet points due to other engagements.
