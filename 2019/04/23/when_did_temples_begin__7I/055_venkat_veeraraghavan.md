BVK Sastri Garu makes a very valid point here.

  

Enough damage has been done on both sides of the political spectrum through wrong definitions and transplanting semantic fields beyond original context. It is important to keep definitions precise so that we know exactly what we are talking about.

  

This was especially driven home to me when on a recent visit to Tirumala, I made the mistake of buying an English translation of the Siva Puranam by Mr. R.M. Chella and published by TTD. Repeated use of the word "Christening" for Parvati's namakarana and that of others and use of similar anglo-saxon terms ripped out of religious, cultural and social context has convinced me that many of us have lost connection to our own roots and that there is an urgency to strengthen the same while understanding what a word means by itself, so that our knowledge is precise and not otherwise.
