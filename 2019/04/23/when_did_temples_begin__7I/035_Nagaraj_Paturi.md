\> This is a Katherine Mayo wannabe tour of the devadasi institution in pre modern south India. What does this have to do with the original question?

  

----- I did not know Katherine Mayo and as such did not understand that expression in the above sentence.

  

Now I read about Katherine Mayo at

  

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katherine_Mayo>

  

and

  

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_India_(book)>  

  

Written in opposition to the[Indian demands for self-rule and independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_independence_movement "Indian independence movement")from[British rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Raj "British Raj"), the book pointed to the treatment of[India's women](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_India "Women in India"), the[untouchables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalit "Dalit"), animals, dirt, and the character of its nationalistic politicians. A large part of the book dealt with the problems resulting from the[marriage of young girls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_marriage_in_India "Child marriage in India").  

  

Now I am truely puzzled by this sentence. I am trying to figure out what is the Katherine Mayo aspect in the book Ntyasumangali by Prof. Saskia Kersenboom

  

Dedication page of the book says

  

To

  

The guru

  

and the Sampradaya

  

The whole book is a presentation of the Devadasi tradition from an insider's perspective with a great respect for the tradition presented by a person who studied it through alost a participant observation by learning the dance and music of the tradition by doing the sishyarika of Smt P Ranganayaki

  

and in the preface of the book she writes,

  

" In India I thank my teacher Smt P Ranganayaki Cunnan who had made me the heir of her family tradition ; Smt Nandini Ramani who does not only train me in Bharata Natyam but also in the ācāram (ritual propriety) and common sense of Hindu life; her family -in-law and her mother who have accepted me for months as a member of their household; ... "

  

In the entire book , she does not write anything bad or negative about the Devadasis or the Devadasi tradition. She does not even hint at even the 'bad' treatment meted out to them. Moreover, she feels sorry for them that their tradition was not properly understood by the modern society.

  

She ends her book by saying,
