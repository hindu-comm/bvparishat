The 10th sarga of Yuddha-kanda of Adhyatma-ramayan describes Ravana performing होमम् without allowing entry to others (रहसि) in an underground chamber (पातालसदृशीं गुहाम्) closed by a stone door (गुहापिधानपाषाणम्) constructed within his palace compound (स्वे मन्दिरे, रावणमन्दिरम्) after he got diksa (मन्त्रम्) from his guru (सद्गुरुः) Shukracharya.

  

Disturbances to the procedure by Ram's vanara-sena (दशकोट्यः प्लवङ्गानाम्), undid all his efforts.
