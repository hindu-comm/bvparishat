What is the spelling in sanskrit for the word uthrani used with panca paatram?  

I am unable to get the meaning of the word uthrani in dictionary...

Also is there a word Rudrani in sanskrit to denote uthrani?

some say it was orginally rudrani that is why the uthrani is in the form of snake , meaning if water is taken then the poison becomes nectar..
