Prof. D. Shiv Shekhar ( Shankar?) Mishra from Lukhnow has almost translated the entire Manasollasa in Hindi in his very informative book,Manasollasa- Ek Sanskrutik Adhyayan,which was published some 30/35 years back.

  

That is the only book which covers all the text.

  

Shri Nene and Prof.Dr.Nalini Sadhale from Hyderabad translated in English some portions of a technical nature like Gaja,Ashva,Fish etc.from Manasollasa,which are really very good.

  

Moreover, Neelkanth Phadke from Pune is the first person to translate the entire Manasollasa in Marathi.It was published in early 2000.

  

Best luck in your efforts.  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
