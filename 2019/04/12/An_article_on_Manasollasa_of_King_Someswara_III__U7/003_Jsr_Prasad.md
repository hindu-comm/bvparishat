Shankara ji,

  

My goodness, it is a grave mistake interpreting the title such a way!

Indeed, I intend to copy-paste another [link](https://www.asianagrihistory.org/articles.htm), wherein a few articles on animals have been published by Dr. Nene and Prof. Sadhale (both are no more, unfortunately). I regret the same.

  

I read an article by these authors, exclusively on botany inMānasollāsa. But unable to locate the same now.

  

Regards
