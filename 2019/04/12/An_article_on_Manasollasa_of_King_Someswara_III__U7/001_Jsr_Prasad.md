Shankara ji,

  

Thanks. You might be aware that this article did not cover discussions on important concepts like ancient Indian botany.

  

For information of other members, [this](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmXoypizjW3WknFiJnKLwHCnL72vedxjQkDDP1mXWo6uco/wiki/Manasollasa.html) link could be helpful. The work is encyclopaedic in nature.

  

Regards
