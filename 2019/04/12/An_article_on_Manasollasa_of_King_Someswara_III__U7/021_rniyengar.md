Manasollasa is a great work. It is in some places better than the more famous Brhatsamhita. As far as I know it is the only text that describes the construction of the stringed instrument; VeeNa. The Baroda ORI edition of 1925 to which Dr.Wakankar is referring, is available on [archive.org](http://archive.org). (Cover page attached). The text is also known as अभिलषार्थचिंतामणि if I am not wrong. Recently a multivolume publication has been brought out by Hampi University in Kannada script and translation. The getup and sketches are attractive but the translation is wanting in accuracy.
