Dear Shri Murthy ji,

  

May I know the purpose for which you require the information about Manasollasa.

  

The thesis of Dr M. N. Joshi is a very good work on it and gives a fairly good idea about the work.

  

The Oriental Institute,Baroda, has brought out its Critical Edition in three volumes.The Introduction thereof will also be useful to you in knowing the importance of that encyclopaedia.

  

Best luck in your search.

  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
