Prasadji,

  

You are right regarding the article by Tanvi Patel. I had shared the link for the benefit of those who have not explored the text yet.  

  

The article in the link you provided, seems to be a copy of Wikipedia page on Mānasollāsa. Even the title of the book is spelt wrongly as Manasollāsa.  

  

"The title *Manasollasa* (मनसोल्लास) is a compound Sanskrit word, consisting of *Mana* (मन) or "mind" and *Sollasa* (सोल्लास) or "rejoicing, delighting"."  

  

regards  
shankara
