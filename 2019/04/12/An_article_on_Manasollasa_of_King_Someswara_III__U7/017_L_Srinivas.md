Indeed, that's quite possible. The late Sri Achaya was a pioneering scientist. He studied cottonseeds, castor oil and then several vegetable oils and fats. He went to the UK and studied under the then top chemistry research professor in the lipids and fats area. He had a highly rewarding career in the food technology area. He wrote all his food history books after retirement. I heard of the existence of 'Mānasollāsa' from his books. I may not be the only one.

  

Thanks, Prof Wakankar, for several useful pointers. I know I can make use of the Hindi reference for sure.
