Dear all,

  

I wish to share with you a small book of mine which is a commentary on the Aditya-hridayam of Ramayanam, based on two Sanskrit commentaries. It is actually

a by product of my classes on Valmiki Ramayanam which are on the you tube. The introduction would give the basic philosophy of Aditya-hridayam. You are free

to share with those who do parayanam of the text.

Aravinda Rao
