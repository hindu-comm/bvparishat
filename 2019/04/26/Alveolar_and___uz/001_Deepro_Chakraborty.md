In Assamese, both the retroflex and the dental set of sounds are pronounced as alveolar. However, they write \[ট (ṭa), ঠ (ṭha), ড (ḍa), ঢ (ḍha), ণ (ṇa)\] and \[ত (ta), থ (tha), দ (da), ধ (dha), ন (na)\] separately following the Brahmic Assamese-Bengali script.  
There is actually no difference in pronouncing ṭa and ta, ḍa and da and so on. Therefore, when they read the alphabet they mention the sounds of the first set as mūrdhanya (cerebral) or prathama (first) and the sounds of the second set as danya (dental) or dvitīya (second): mūrdhanya ta, mūrdhanya tha, ... danya ta, dantya tha... or prathama ta, prathama tha... dvitīya ta, dvitīya tha... etc. Otherwise, the native speakers won't understand which sound is referred to just from the pronunciation.
