Is there any modern Indian language other than Malayalam that has the alveolar ṯ, alveolar ḏ and alveolar ṉ sounds either as full-fledged phonemes or at least as allophones of the corresponding dental or alveolar sounds?

I know that there are some Gujarati speakers, especially from among the Bohra Muslims who pronounce the dental t and d as alveolar. But these are a small minority of Gujarati speakers.

Malayalam has all these sounds as full fledged phonemes, and they are quite distinct from corresponding dental and retroflex sounds. For example:

Kuṯṯi = a stake; kuṭṭi = a child; kutti (verb, past tense) = stabbed

I know that written Tamil has n and ṉ but the native Tamil speaker does not distinguish these sounds in speech.

Do any ancient Sanskrit works speak of these alveolar sounds?
