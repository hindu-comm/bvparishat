Indic Academy seeks to bring about a global renaissance based on Indic Civilisational thought.[Indic Academy](http://www.indicacademy.org/)has now collaborated with Gateway Education to create an alternative education platform â€“**IGenPlus**for young students, aimed at inculcating ancient wisdom, developing modern insights and building future dreams through workshops, festivals, cultural experiences, expeditions, conferences, and competitions.

As a part of this initiative, we will be supporting Summer Camps for Art & Culture all over India by way of grants. These summer camps should be centred around teaching any, some or all of the following:

-   Values from our Ithihasas, Puranas, Literary and Folk tales -   Chanting of key mantras and prayers -   Indic Knowledge Systems such as mathematics, astronomy, literature,
    Sanskrit etc. -   Art forms like dancing, singing, painting, craft etc. -   Yoga, Ayurveda & Spirituality

The focus of the summer camps should be to educate the students intellectually, culturally and spiritually. The collaboration would include support of upto INR 25,000 or 50% of the expenses, whichever is less. Applications consisting of the background of the founders/institutions, budget and details of the camp can be sent to[nam...@igenplus.com]().
