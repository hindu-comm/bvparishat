I would like to elaborate my third point:

That is just the point. However, I would not say the status "was not a high one", but "is the lowest" within the *varṇa* spectrum, *categorically* different from the three higher varṇas which are to be served by Śūdras in unquestioning obedience. In other words there is a *fundamental* difference between a *dvija* (Brāhmaṇa, Kṣatriya, Vaiśya) and a Śūdra*.*
