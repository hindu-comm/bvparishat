I appreciate the significance and clarity in your expression :\<******I am primarily interested in what human beings have actually done, thought and said, and why**.>

  

In relation to the sanskrit-commentary-quotes you have placed in the post, my understanding ( like many in traditional schools) is as follows:

  

\- what humans of tradition thought right from Gita times to current period on ‘chaturvarnya’ is on same tone: classification based on ‘ GUNA’ - which is not limited by parentage- parental marriage formality- profession- education . What is this ‘ GUNA- Karma’ for social culture and community , has been contextual in different periods of history and localities ( north - south/. Birth brahmins- others). Each community in history practiced the thought in their own best interests. It is a dynamic transformation.

  

Do we have to debate it or just document as passing history and proceed to find the relevance of it for global context? Now?

  

\- what humans of tradition practiced in local context and hold as pride of cultural heritage- ? There is a wide gap in theory and practice.

Do we have to debate it through our translations and pass judgments using diabolical translations? And keep hurting pride and sentiments?

or just document past, note how we have the same problem in different period now and context?? And find solutions??  

  

In short is this a post mortem study or study for enlightenment? Where is the focus? Why this debate?

  

Help me understand.
