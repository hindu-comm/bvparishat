NamasteNityānanda Miśra,

  

 I'm impressed with what you do. The more that I work on epics as well. And I compare translations of Rigveda and Atharvaveda (sample<http://gasyoun.github.io/>).

I can only say, that the Russian translation, done many years ago and published lately, has both things right. No additions and the tense is right.

  

100 Брахман, читающий эту повесть,

да станет красноречивым!

Кшатрий —

да будет владыкой земли!

Вайшья —

да преуспеет в торговле!

И да обретет величие

даже рожденный шудрой!»

Такова в «Рамаяне», прославленной первой поэме, сочиненной риши Вальмики, первая песнь «Книги о детстве».

  

Рамаяна. Кн. 1. Балаканда (Книга о детстве). Кн. 2. Айодхьяканда (Книга об Айодхье) / Изд. подг. П. А. Гринцер. — М.: Ладомир; Наука, 2006.

Thanks for the comments,Roland Steiner. Indeed it seems to be a matter of style.

Yes, one can disagree, because it's not 1 to 1.

Yes,“schoolboy error“ is not what we see here.

Why do not we ask Goldman directly? He answers e-mails. Is this the only thing done wrong or is there a list? Actually Nityānand's square braquets is something rarely met in English translations done in India, it's something kind a "German" style, but it's the clearest style around. Too bad too few use it,
