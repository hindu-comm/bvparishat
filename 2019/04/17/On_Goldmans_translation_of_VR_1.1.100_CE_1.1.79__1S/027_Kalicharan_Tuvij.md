 What was Shambuka striving towards? The word given is: mahAyaSa i.e. "great fame" or, again, "greatness".

 It shows that greatness is indeed the quality Shudra-s strive for (and likely get depending upon the effort).

  

 While translating a text that too rooted in Vaishnava tradition, the translator would do well to take a bird's eye view first: the vituperatives against Shudra-s are just that - not reflecting of the ground reality (or actual event) of that time.

  

 Then, again, Valmiki himself comes from "down below". "api" should be therefore rather understood as Valmiki's plea to an unforgiving first audience, while still acknowledging "greatness" as a specific (not casually applied) trait of Shudra Varna.

 (Doesn't the Brahminical tradition admit that Shudra-s and Women represent knowledge streams that are supplementary to (i.e. not found in) the knowledge systems of later gurukula-s?)

  

 If Christ for example did straight talk about "Father, Son and Mother" - instead of the incongruous "Father, Son and Holy spirit" - he would've been dead long before his sermon.

  

 The same constraints are seen in Krishna's words in Gita as well.

  

P.S.

 Can one rely on people that are outsiders to grasp these finer points? Actually the outsiders are in some ways advantageously placed to do so. Unfortunately, they have their own agenda, and the translation job is as if "after the small pox ploy failed on the natives".
