I wrote: "I am primarily interested in what human beings have actually done, thought and said, and why." I did not write: "what is said is what is done". Quite the contrary: I explicitly differentiated "between societies or their ideals (**which is not the same**)". The insinuation of such a naive approach ("what is said is what is done") is not particularly friendly, to say the least. It reveals a fundamental or intentional misunderstanding of the actual methods of Indological research.
