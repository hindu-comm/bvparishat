The message is that a westerner knows about Ramayana should be gratifying to the people of India!

The person cannot dive into the culture to appreciate the nuances, but may labor hard to scratch the  

surface to check words in a dictionary! The model is incorrect.  

As I said before, some university should do an intensive two-year course for anyone to understand

the book. People may discover their errors in the process. The map is different! All scholarly work

needs self-discovery..
