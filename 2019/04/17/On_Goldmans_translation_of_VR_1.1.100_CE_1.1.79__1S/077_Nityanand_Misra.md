The *Kataka* makes it crystal clear and is particularly insightful:

  

*‘iṇ’ āśiṣi liṅ, ‘akṛtsārvadhātuke’ iti dīrghaḥ, īṅ (iṅ?) gatāvityasmāditi kaścit, sa tvātmanepadī.*

  

(text from IIT Kanpur site)

  

By saying *tu*, the commentator probably indicates that he disagrees with taking*īyāt*as the *vidhiliṅ*from*iṅ gatau*; the Pāṇinian form would be*īyīta* (*adhīyīta*) as the root is indeed*ātmanepadī*. One would have to consider an*ārṣapadavyatyaya* and treat*iṅ gatau*as *parasmaipadī*here to get the form*īyāt* (*adhīyāt*)in*vidhiliṅ*. Probably that is what the great commentators (authors ofTilaka, Śiromaṇi, and Bhūṣaṇa)considered, though they did not specify it.

  

In any case, one can take*āśiṣi liṅ* or*prārthanāyāṃ liṅ*, in both cases it is very different from*laṭ*.

  

Thanks, Nityananda
