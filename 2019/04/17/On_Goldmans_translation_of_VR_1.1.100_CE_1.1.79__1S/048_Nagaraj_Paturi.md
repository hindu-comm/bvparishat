Dear Sri Achyut-ji,

  

'Being touchy about caste' does not apply to the learned western scholar Dr Steiner who participated in this thread.

  

If at all, he has been defending the translation of a Ramayana verse by Prof. Goldman. In course of that he has been insisting on the hierarchy in the varNa system.

  

----------

  

But the issue of comparison between the European estate system and varNa system , has been brought in for discussion in the Indological context by Prof. Sheldon Pollock.

His assumption, strong belief in the causal relationship between ideas in the texts and the social reality is very clearly coming out here.

  

It is such 'textualist' flaw and its potential to spread wrong consequences that necessitates the highlighting of the differences between systems in texts and systems in reality and existence or absence of causal relationship between textual content and social reality.
