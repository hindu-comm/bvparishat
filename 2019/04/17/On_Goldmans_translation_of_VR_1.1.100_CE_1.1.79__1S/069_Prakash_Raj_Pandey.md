When the phala-stutis of Ramayan, Vishnusahasranamastotra, and Bhagavat are read together, one may say:

  

The objective of study for a Brahman was to be a man of letters, scholar of Vedanta, and wise; for a Kshatriya to be a conqueror and be the king of the land up to the sea; for a Vaisya to increase profits from sale of his merchandise, and to be rich; for a Shudra to be absolved of his misdeeds and sins, thereby get exalted position, and comfort and happiness.

  

When Shudra studied the scriptures, he got promoted to "Dvija" category (जन्मना जायते शूद्रः संस्काराद् द्विज उच्यते), (otherwise how would others recognise his exalted position (महत्त्वम्)?)

  

The popular notion that teaching learning was monopolised by Brahmans in ancient times holds no ground.
