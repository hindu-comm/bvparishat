Leaving aside the various personal insults, polemics, rhetoric, and funny malicious distortions in several of the most recent postings to this thread, to which I will not react, if only because of lack of time:

  
  
\> What was prevalent in the society was caste system. There are hundreds if not thousands of castes in reality.  
  

May I gently remind you that we've been discussing *Rāmāyaṇa* 1.1.79 (crit ed.):

  
  
*paṭhan* *dvijo* *vāgṛṣabhatvam īyāt  
syāt kṣatriyo bhūmipatitvam īyāt  
vaṇigjanaḥ paṇyaphalatvam īyāj  
janaś ca śūdro 'pimahattvam*

*īyāt  
(*śṛṇvan hi *śūdro 'pimahattvam* *īyāt)*  
  
**It's about varṇas, not "castes".**  
  
In his *Rāmāyaṇatilaka* Nāgeśa Bhaṭṭa comments on that, among other things:  
  
*dvijo mukhyadvijo brāhmaṇaḥ \[...\] śūdro 'py janas traivarṇikadāsaḥ.*  
  
That is what I would call

  
  
\> hierarchically placed items of the spectrum  
  

rather than

  
  
\> horizontally placed items of the spectrum  
  

And that is the very reason why *api* means "even", not "too", in *Rāmāyaṇa* 1.1.79.  
  
May everybody judge for herself or for himself. It's time to leave. Good bye.  
  
R.S.
