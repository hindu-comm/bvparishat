नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

a lowly Sudra ----

  

'lowly' is a विशेषणम् of 'शूद्र॑ ---

  

संभवव्यभिचाराभ्यां स्याद्विशेषणमर्थवत् - is the नियम (norm that is mentioned in मीमांसा , व्याकरण् etc and followed by all systems) --

  

the विशेषणम्॑श्वेतः॑ in ' श्वेतः काकः॑ is unmeaningful as there is no संभव of a white crow ( at least in India - in Africa there may be ).

Similarly , the विशेषणम्॑ नीलः॑ in ' नीलः काकः॑ is also unmeaningful as a काक is always नील only and therefore there is no व्यभिचार to the विशेषणम् - नीलः ।

  

As I have already mentioned in another post on रामायणम् , any teacher / translator / commentator should be equipped with the general universal norms of पदवाक्यप्रमाणाशास्त्राणि , viz व्याकरणम् , न्यायवैशेषिके , पूर्वमीमांसा ।

  

On the other hand , if the translator wants to make the culture specific point understandable to people of other cultures then he may put in brackets -- a Sudra (a person belonging to the last caste as per Indian tradition) .

There is another problem --

  

if you say ' a lowly Sudra ' then it means there is one ' a highly Sudra ' -- what about him - the reader may get a doubt - परिशेषन्याय -
the king's first wife is good - this implies - the second wife is bad .

  

Under शूद्राणाम् अनिरवसितानाम् (पा सू) , Nagesa discusses (even Panini means it) - सच्छूद्र-s (good Sudras ) are allowed to perform certain rites .

  

What is the problem ?

  

I tell my students - a translator should have very good command not only on both the source and target languages but also on both the cultures . Indian culture is rich in all aspects and most of the time it is difficult to offer a faithful rendering , especially for a work like Ramayanam , at a satisfactory level .

  

Ramayanam is a Veda and everyone across the globe should read it - it is universal - written for mankind - so one should take care that the real message is delivered - some training in गुरुकुलम् would certainly help .

धन्यो॑स्मि
