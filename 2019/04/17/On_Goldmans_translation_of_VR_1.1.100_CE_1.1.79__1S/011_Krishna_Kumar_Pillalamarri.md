Hi Marcis,

Why do you continue to use the phrase, 'lowest varna'? Neither Dharma claims it, nor Valmiki hinted it. Why are you also manufacturing the phrase [a.la](http://a.la) Goldman? If there is a mechanical engineer, should he feel 'low varna'? With these kinds of use, we distort the varna sampradaya. My sincere hope is we avoid such insinuations in these discussions. What Sri Mishra pointed out is correct.

  

Regards,

Krishna Kumar Pillalamarri
