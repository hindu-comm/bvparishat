Dear Paturiji,

  

The question is have all social systems upto this date not been hierarchial. The question of it being decided by birth was because India has been a land of invasions. Each new wave of invaders had to be assimilated into the social order. Secondly these invasions brought in new ethenic as well as lingual groups. As a result the social hierarchy became more complex and therefore apparently more rigid over generations.

  

What is happening in the West as well as in the US when they have to face immigration on a largescale? Are immigrants not being subjected to oppression? India has faced such mass exodus from the West for centuries. Have the White Americans or Europeans intermingled with the blacks whom they brought from Africa? Have the Americans been in a position to change the future of the black for good? In this animals are surely better. The day has yet to dawn when man socially sees and treats his fellow humans like himself.

  

In short foisting a modern 'scholarly' view on ancient history trivializes history. The fact that he needs to prove that he is better of today than yesterday itself proves his present wretched condition with which he cannot cope up.

  

The most important thing that needs to be highlighted is that there was no religion in our history nay there were neither any institutions through which it was administered. Our history is secular. It is for this reason that it is called a way of life. It is of the people.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
