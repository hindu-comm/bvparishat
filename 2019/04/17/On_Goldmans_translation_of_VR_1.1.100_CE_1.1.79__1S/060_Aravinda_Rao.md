Dear all,

  

This is with reference to the query by Sri Achyut Karve about the extraordinary interest of the western scholars in the caste system in India.

  

My understanding is that their hearts are weighed down with guilt as their ancestors committed genocide, enslaved millions of people, wiped out sattvic civilizations and did what all can be thought of. Even today we see movements like 'black lives matter' etc, and every few days a black man is shot by a white cop. Racism was official till recently. Hence to alleviate the guilt and remorse in their hearts they have to discover some sins in others and derive some solace.

It is a psychological need. And as a student of Vedanta I think that we can be happy that we are a source of happiness for them.

  

Probably Gandhi would pray 'sab ko sanmati de bhagavan'. In the same vein I felt like composing a prayer to their God Jehovah to give them all some

good sense, particularly to the intellectuals. There are some good poets in this group who can compose better prayers than my prosaic poem.

  

यह्व त्वां परदेवतेति वदतां दौर्जन्यमाहो प्रभो

त्वन्नाम्ना रचयन्ति राज्य-विलयान् सर्वत्र त्वत्किङ्कराः।

विश्वे सर्वत एव जाति हननं निश्शञ्कया कारितम्

तेषां चित्तविशोधनं कुरु विभो मेधाविनां मुख्यतः।

  

As students of Vedanta we should not have any objection to say a prayer to Jehovah. The term raajya-vilaya refers to the regime changing wars fought by the west. This is not to offend anyone but I only told what the whole world knows.

Having said that I am also aware that we have to rectify our own fault lines, for which I always say that our swamis have to take an active role in it.

Aravinda Rao K
