Dear scholars,

  

An incidental observation on Ramayana is interesting. In the Yuddha kanda, while returning to Ayodhya by Pushpaka vimana, Rama describes several places. One is the Nalasetu, now known as Ramasetu. Rama says:

एतत्तु दृश्यते तीर्थं सागरस्य महात्मनः।

सेतुबन्ध इति ख्यातं त्रैलोक्येन च पूजितम्॥

एतत्पवित्रं परमं महापातकनाशनम्। 6-123-21

The commentator Tryambaka Makhi, while commenting on this, quotes from Parasara smriti and from Parasara-Madhaviyam and says how the visit to a samudra setu removes all sins.

Rama too is saying that it is a tirtham, a sacred place.

Does it mean that Nalasetu was a place of pilgrimage from olden days? This is the only setu on the ocean and there may not be any other meaning for this. Traditional people may know this.
