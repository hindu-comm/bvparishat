\> Now let us come to the word sēvā . You too used the word serve , service  
\> etc. as the English equivalent of this. Is 'lowly' the only way of looking  
\> at 'serving' 'service' etc. in the contemporary society ?  
\>  
\> The activities of the s'ūdras have been viewed to be as foundational to the  
\> life of the remaining three varṇas as legs are to the remaining human body  
\> comprising of the head, shoulders and the trunk. Such a view is evident  
\> from the Purusha Sukta description of the four varṇas through the analogy  
\> of the human body.  
  

You are right: the word "service" is not completely adequate in this context, because it partly leads the *modern* recipient (who has internalized the *ideals* of the French Revolution \[abolition of the privileges of noble birth, and nominal establishment of equality among men\] and the American Bill of Rights) to false, namely too benign, associations. It glosses over the hard reality described in the texts.  
  
To get things straight: We are not talking about the "way of looking at 'serving' 'service' etc. in the contemporary society", but in the world of ancient Indian texts. And these texts are remarkably clear and in agreement in this matter. Suffice it to quote a number of commentaries to *Bhagavadgītā* 4.13 (apart from the already cited texts):  
  
*Bhagavadgītā* 4.13 *(Śrībhagavān uvāca)*:  
*cāturvarṇyaṃ mayā sṛṣṭaṃ guṇakarmavibhāgaśaḥ*  
*tasya kartāram api māṃ viddhy akartāram avyayam*  
  
*guṇakarmavibhāgaśaḥ*  
The commentators explain unanimously that the four varṇas created by Kṛṣṇa **differ in their natural constitution** which is formed by **different innate qualities (*guṇa*)**, namely *sattva*, *rajas*, and *tamas.* These "innate qualities" involve specific duties (*karman*). Example: A being whose principle innate quality is *tamas* (associated with darkness, ignorance, heaviness, indifference, restraint, matter, etc.) has to serve a being whose principle innate quality is *sattva* (associated with goodness, light, pleasure, thought, etc.). Needless to say that beings are constituted that way because of their own previous *karman.* The underlying theoretical conception is entirely coherent in this respect and connected with the idea of perfect justice.

*Vāsiṣṭhasmṛti* 6.24 gives the following unambiguous definition of a Śūdra:  
  
*dīrghavairam asūyā cāsatyaṃ brahmadūṣaṇam*  
*paiśūnyaṃ nirdayatvaṃ ca jānīyāc chūdralakṣaṇam

Please allow me a very last remark (just to avoid possible misunderstandings): As an indologist, I am *not interested* in the criticism or assessment of ancient or modern or any societies or their ideals (which is not the same), of philosophical and religious concepts, etc. That's not my point. I am primarily interested in history and accurate historical research based on evidence, or, in simple words: I am primarily interested in what human beings have actually done, thought and said, and why.  
  
Best,
