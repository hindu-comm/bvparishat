Prakash-ji,

I appreciate your approach.

The discourse "on-stage" is, however, between the Western Indologist and the "native Pundit" who tutored and fathered the initial generations of the former. Of late after documenting the learnings in neat dictionaries the former felt complete freedom from the latter, who in turn felt hurt due to diminished importance, and both have been since on a "warring path".

 Truth became the first casualty in this.

 Who told the Indologist that "Shudra is the lowest Varna?" -- our own pay-by-the-day Pundit (guided by his sectarian zeal, without digging deep into what Dharma actually entails).

 This word has been abused so much that today nobody identifies with this Varna. And irrespective of the fact that Shudra-s, like Brahmana-s and Kshatriya-s, actually constitute a small fraction of Indian population (in the South their numbers are next to nil), this has not stopped brilliant people from labelling the majority ("Jana") as "lowly Shudra-s" so that they could grab political power by championing their cause. First create victim (make Shudra-s into Dasa-s into Jana-s) and then champion their cause.

  

 Reआशीर्लिङ्

आशीर्लिङ् doesn't hold a 1-to-1 with English Benedictineand various translations making use of cohortive-style "shall", "if", "will", etc (that are certainly not simple present or future) only indicate approximations towardsआशीर्लिङ्\|

 Gita press translation "इसे ब्राह्मण पढ़े तो विद्वान् हो" gets it still better.

  

 I opt out of this thread.
