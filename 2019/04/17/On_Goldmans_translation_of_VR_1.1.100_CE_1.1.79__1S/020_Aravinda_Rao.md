Apart from Goldman's translation (which I have not seen) even our people have committed egregious errors. I noticed that the translation by Sri MN Dutt has several blunders. For instance, in 6-115-17, the verse reads

प्राप्तचारित्रसन्देहा मम प्रतिमुखे स्थिता।

दीपो नेत्रातुरस्येव प्रतिकूलासि मे दृढा॥

The expression प्राप्तचारित्रसन्देहा is a bahuvrihi samasa which means 'a person whose character stands in doubt'. But Sri Dutt translates, 'I have suspected your character'. It is an unpardonable error. In fact, there is a dhwani in the verse that it is not the fault of the lamp but it is the sickness of the onlooker which is making the lamp disagreeable.

Again in 6-177-5, after agni-pravesa, when all the gods appear, it was Rama who was standing with folded hands but Sri Dutt writes that the gods stood with folded hands. Gods raised their hands in a blessing posture.

Such errors are many in Dutt. I have been using that book while teaching as there is no other handy book available to jot down some notes.

Probably we need a good translation by someone, or by a team which reads the Sanskrit commentaries and prepares it.
