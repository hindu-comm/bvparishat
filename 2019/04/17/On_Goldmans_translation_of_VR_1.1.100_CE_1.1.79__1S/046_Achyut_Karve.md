Why is the west so touchy about the word caste. What happened in France during the French Revolution? What were the Estates? Who were the people in the third estate? What was their condition? Was the revolution not caused because of the abject condition of the third estate and because they had no opportunity to rIse in the social order.
It should also be noted that our Kings were not born to be Kings. They too were ones amongst us. The worst part of the Western World was the Church against which the people rose in protest. And yes what is the church? Even today it is rid with allegations regarding sexual abuse which is covered by the Pope and his Ministers. The caste system too was a product of the feudal system. What needs to be noted is that the system was not as bad as it was in the western world during the feudal era.

  

We wrote history not the way the West conceives it. We wrote it so that it serve as an ideal for the future generations. Cite one example where the West conceived history the way we did.

  

We will surely like to read it.
