Please allow me a very last remark (just to avoid possible misunderstandings): As an indologist, I am *not interested* in the criticism or assessment of ancient or modern or any societies or their ideals (which is not the same), of philosophical and religious concepts, etc. That's not my point. I am primarily interested in history and accurate historical research based on evidence, or, in simple words: I am primarily interested in what human beings have actually done, thought and said, and why.  

  

Dear Roland,

The above is a separate discussion. I am very much interested in it.
The analysis of human beings by world philosophers is something worthwhile to study. But here we are discussing Goldman's arbitrary use of words under some perceived knowledge.   

Please do start a new thread with your desired topic.

Thank you.  

BM
