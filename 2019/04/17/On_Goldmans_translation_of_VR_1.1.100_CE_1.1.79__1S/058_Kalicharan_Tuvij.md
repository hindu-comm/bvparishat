Very late source. Even then, we come to know that sevA is atleast one of the specialities of Shudra-s. What is the sevA being remembered here? Servitude? Or to be a do-gooder? Who decides?

śuśrūṣayā = by the power of correct analysis. Am I concocting a meaning here? No, I exactly understand where these words are coming from.

Same as \[*Manusmṛti*11.235 \] - a late source, but still indicative of one aspect, sevA (not servitude, as before).

vayasādhikāḥ = wisdom (gained with real experience, not bookish knowledge).  

  

This clearly indicates that the mahattva ascribed to Shudra-s is specific to wisdom.

Duly noted. Nothing more to say in this thread. I suggest some more tapasya to fill large lacunae in basic understanding.
