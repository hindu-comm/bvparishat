Dear all, Sri Achyut-ji and Dr Aravinda Rao garu,

  

When we use words like 'they' in reference to western Indologists, let us remember that not all of them subscribe to Christianity or nationalism based on their citizenship or nationality. So saying , 'you say this about Hinduism', how about this in Christianity?' or 'you say this about Indian nation', how about this in your nation' may not really apply to your respondent western Indologist.

  

Many of the western Indologists consider /claim themselves to belong to " no religion" and /or " no nation" .

  

Their criticisms of Sanskrit, Hinduism, India, Indian nation etc. could be from such a standpoint. In such cases, responses such as "How about your religion? How about your nation? " may not make sense and that is not a good way of answering criticisms about Sanskrit, Hinduism, India, Indian nation etc.

  

Let us handle the questions and/or criticisms from the western Indologists assuming that our respondent considers /claims himself/herself to belong to " no religion" and /or " no nation" .unless they openly claim their subscription or affiliation to a certain religion or nation. Let the strength of our argument lie not in " How about you? type comments but in the logic and reasoning in our argument only.
