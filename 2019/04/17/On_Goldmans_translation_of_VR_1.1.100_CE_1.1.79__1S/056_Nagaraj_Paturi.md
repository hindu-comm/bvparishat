\> The fourth "fruit", however, is a*general*one:*mahattvam*which could be attributed to each and everyone, which, by the way, is a further indicator of the singularity of the fourth and last Pāda in comparison to the first three Pādas of*Rāmāyaṇa*1.1.79 (crit ed.) corresponding to the singularity of the fourth varṇa in comparison to the first three varṇas.

  

---- The remaining three phalas cover specific achievements for the three different varNas because each of the varNa comprises people of one skill only. The fourth varNa in the list in the verse consists of people of multiple skills, it is a group of sub-groups each specialising in a skill ; for brevity, instead of mentioning a huge list of ' -tvams' for that one group, the poet chose to use the common goal of all the sub-groups, mahattvam in the skill of each of the sub-group.
