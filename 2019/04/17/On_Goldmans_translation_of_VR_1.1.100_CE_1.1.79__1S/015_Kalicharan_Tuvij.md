Namaste.  

जनश्च शूद्रोऽपि महत्त्वमीयात्  

1\) If not viewed with coloured glasses, it is evident (the way it is written) that the text is constraining itself (against prejudices perhaps?) to give the term Shudra its due.  
2) So as per the text, Shudra is entitled to greatness, just as other Varna-s are entitled to things mentioned earlier.  
3) Sanskrit verbal system is extremely complex and nuanced. If you end up translating one verbal case as another, chances are you are doing it wrong.  
  
  
P.S.  
1) Someone mentioned mechanical engineering as Shudra profession, which is a wrong classification.  
2) While it is true that giving service to others (paricharyA) is one Shudra profession, one should do well to remember that "punishing others" is also the other aspect of service. This means people involved in judicial processes (judges, advocates, policia, etc). Just an example.  
3) Engineering securely falls within Vaishya (having profeteeabity as goal).  
4) The mere fact that there are overwhelmingly more Shaiva Brahmana-s than Vaishnava, is IMHO due to the fact that Shudra kings (the majority of kings in Kaliyuga) were (/are?) overwhelmingly Shaiva-s.
