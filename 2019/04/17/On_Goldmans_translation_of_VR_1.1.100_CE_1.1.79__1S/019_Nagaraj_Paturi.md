if vaagrishabhatvam is the characteristic of Brahmins ,  

  

bhoomipatitvam is the characteristic of kshatriyas

  

and puNyaphalatvam is the characteristic of Vaishyas,

  

then

  

mahattvam is the characteristic of s'udras

  

or

  

vaagrishabhatvam is what Brahmins strive for and that is why they are being assured of it here,

  

bhoomipatitvam is what Kshatriyas strive forand that is why they are being assured of it

  

puNyaphalatvam is what vaishyas strive forand that is why they are being assured of it

  

then mahattvam is what s'udras strive for and that is why they are being assured of it

  

or

  

If the feature Mahattvam is what is not there for a S'udra and he is being assured of it through the verse,

  

this logic applies to all the remaining three varNas,

  

vaagrishabhatvam should be what Brahmins do not have and that is why they are being assured of it here,

  

bhoomipatitvam should be what Kshatriyas do not have and that is why they are being assured of it

  

puNyaphalatvam should be what vaishyas do not have and that is why they are being assured of it

  

But that is not correct about the three varNas Brahmin, kshatriya and Vaishya ; so

  

as per reductio ad absurdum,

  

'the feature Mahattvam is what is not there for a S'udra' also can not be inferred from the verse.
