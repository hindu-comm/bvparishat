One instance I know where a verb in benedictive mood is taken as in present tense is in Gayatri Mantra. This was discussed in

  

<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/bvparishat/4nR2ruPNKSw/wH8qP1q01gUJ;context-place=forum/bvparishat>

  

But there, the justification for such a change from the express form to the understood meaning is the syntax, the yattadarthaka structure of the sentence. But

  

here, there is no such compulsion.

  

Regarding 'lowly', one may justify the translation as based on the use of च and अपि. But that can just be a routine usage or for inclusiveness.

  

The mentioned phala for each varNa, in the verse, is the characteristic of the varNa as per the convention. Thus mahattvam is mentioned as the characteristic of s'udra.
