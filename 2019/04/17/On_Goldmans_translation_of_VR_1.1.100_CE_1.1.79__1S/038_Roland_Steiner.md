I have only three final points to add:  
  

\> 5. Steiner has only attempted to mislead by citing the meaning of *jana* as "a low man, the mob".

\> This sense is found neither in Apte's *Students Sanskrit-English Dictionary*,

\> nor in Apte's *Practical Sanskrit-English Dictionary.*



\> It is there only in the *Revised and Enlarged* 3-Volume Dictionary edited by Gode & Co.(**1958**).

\> (VSApte lived during 1858-1892).



\> And even there, it occurs as *the very last sense*, ***with no citation for attestation*,**

\> - but only with the remark LDB (referring to the List of Dineshchandra Bhattacharya).

\> The last, and immensely rare, sense is then, Goldman's choicest one!  
  

1\. This meaning is also recorded in.  
  
Böhtlingk/Roth: Sanskrit-Wörterbuch (= PW*): "Einer aus dem Haufen, ein gemeiner Mensch*. (vgl. *pṛthagjana*) H. an. \[= Hemacandra's *Anekārthasaṃgraha*\] Med. \[= *Medinīkoṣa*\] Kir. \[= *Kirātārjunīya*\] 2, 42. 47.)*."*  
Compare Mallinātha *ad* *Kirātārjunīya* 2.42: *janavat = pṛthagjanam iva*.  
  
*Kirātārjunīya* 2.47cd:  
*sahate na jano 'py adhaḥkriyāṃ kim u lokādhikadhāma rājakam* (Mallinātha: *janaḥ prākṛto ’pi*).  
  
Böhtlingk: Sanskrit-Wörterbuch in kürzerer Fassung (= pw): *"Einer aus dem grossen Haufen, ein gewöhnlicher --, ein gemeiner Mensch*."  
  
  
2. That "lowly" could be a rendition of *jana* was only *my* assumption (= not Goldman's explanation); hence, blame me, not him. In my view, however, the function of the particle *api* ("though", "even") is an entirely sufficient justification of the insertion of "lowly", especially with regard to the envisaged international readership of Goldman's translation. (In order to calm everybody preventively: yes, I know that *api* also means "And, also, too, moreover, besides, in addition" etc.)  
  
  
3.

  
\> 7. It is quite another matter that the status of the *s'Udra* was not a high one.  
  

That is just the point. However, I would not say "was not a high one", but "is the lowest" within the *varṇa* spectrum.  
  
Best,

PS:

  
  
\> not at least for one who craves for the title of the best translator  
  

An excellent illustration of uncalled-for polemics.
