Dear Sri Nityananda-ji and all,



I was glad to see you call attention to what may be understood as a benedictive or āśīr-liṅ verb in this verse. It reminded me of an article that I had written on this kind of verb some years ago (attached). I have always liked the sentiment that this kind of verb expresses.



The three Sanskrit commentaries that I consulted seem to have understood this verb, īyāt, as an optative or vidhi-liṅ. Of the nine English translations of the Rāmāyaṇa that I have, some translated this verb as a simple future, and some as a simple narrative present (as indicated below). Interestingly, none of them translated this verb as a benedictive.



The three commentaries, Tilaka, Śiromaṇi, and Bhūṣaṇa, all gloss īyāt with the optative verb prāpnuyāt (he “would attain/obtain”). Govindarāja’s Bhūṣaṇa adds grammatical analysis, saying: ī-gatāv ity asmād dhātor liṅ. (The dhātu is given as long ī, not short i, in both the 1911 Krishnacharya and Vyasacharya edition with Govindaraja’s commentary, and in the 1912 Bombay edition with three commentaries.) The Tilaka commentary takes syāt from the second pāda in the meaning of yadi, as does the Bhūṣaṇa commentary, and the Bhūṣaṇa construes this with each of the four pādas: yadi . . . īyāt/prāpnuyāt (“if . . . he would attain/obtain”).



Rāmāyaṇa 1.1.79 critical edition, 1.1.100 Gita Press edition (and 1912 Bombay edition, 1.1.107 Gorresio edition, with variant reading in pāda 4: śṛṇvan hi śūdro for janaś ca śūdro, 1.1.99 in Krishnacharya 1905 edition, 1.1.97 in Krishnachary and Vyasacharya 1911 edition):

paṭhan dvijo vāgṛṣabhatvam īyāt syāt kṣatriyo bhūmipatitvam īyāt \|  

vaṇigjanaḥ paṇyaphalatvam īyāj janaś ca śūdro 'pi mahattvam īyāt \|\| 79 \|\|



1. Ralph T. H. Griffith, 1870 (future tense):

Bráhmans who read shall gather hence

The highest praise for eloquence.

The warrior, o'er the land shall reign,

The merchant, luck in trade obtain;

And Śúdras listening\* ne'er shall fail

To reap advantage from the tale.

\* Śúdras, men of the fourth and lowest pure caste, were not allowed to read the poem, but might hear it recited.



2. Manmatha Nath Dutt, 1892 (present tense):

If a Brāhmana readeth it, he attaineth excellence in speech; if a Kshatriya, he acquireth lordship over landed possessions; if a Vaisya, abundance of wealth in trade; and if a Sudra, greatness.



3. C. R. Sreenivasa Ayyangar, 1910 (three present tense and one future tense):

Should a Brahmana read it, gift of speech is his meed, and wisdom equalled by none. Should one of the Warrior race read it, the wide Earth and all it contains owns his sway. Should a Vaisya read it, merchant-princes pay homage to him; nay, should a Sudra happen to hear it read, he shall win honor and glory among his kind.



4. Makhan Lal Sen, 1927 (future tense):

If a Brahmana reads it, he will attain excellence in speech; if a Kshatriya does it, he will lord it over all; if a Vaishya reads it, he will get abundance of wealth in trade; and a Sudra will attain greatness by listening to the tale.



5. Hari Prasad Shastri, 1952 (three present tense and one future tense):

A brahmin reading this becomes proficient in the Vedas, and philosophy; a kshatriya becomes a king; a vaishya grows prosperous in trade; a shudra, on reading this will become great in his caste.



6. Cimmanlal Goswami, Gita Press, 1969 (present tense with future sense):

Reading it a Brahman bids fair to attain eminence in eloquence; if he is a Kṣatriya, he is sure to attain lordship over the earth; a man belonging to the mercantile community is sure to secure profit in trade and a man belonging to the Śudra class can hope to attain superiority (in his own class).



7. N. Raghunathan, 1981 (future tense):

The reader of the work will win mastery in the art of speech if he is a Brahmana, empire if he is a Kshattriya, the fruits of commerce if he is a Vaisya, and power and position if he is a Sudra.



8. Robert P. Goldman, 1984 (present tense):

A brahman who reads it becomes eloquent, a kshatriya becomes a lord of the earth, a vaiśya acquires profit from his goods, and even a lowly śūdra achieves greatness.



9. Bibek Debroy, 2017 (present tense):

A brahmana who reads this becomes eloquent in speech, a kshatriya obtains lordship over land, a merchant obtains the fruits of trading and a shudra person obtains greatness.



We notice that numbers 1, 3, and 4, by Griffith, Ayyangar, and Sen, have the śūdra listening to rather than reading the Rāmāyaṇa. This is in accordance with most of the commentaries, and several of the northern manuscripts having the variant reading in pāda 4: śṛṇvan hi śūdro for janaś ca śūdro. It would not have been known to most western readers. As explained to his readers by Robert Goldman in his notes to this verse (p. 279):



“In keeping with Hindu tradition, N \[northern manuscripts of the Rāmāyaṇa\] does not allow the lowly śūdras actually to read or recite (paṭh) the Rāmāyaṇa. Several N manuscripts substitute śṛṇvan hi, ‘hearing.’ This prejudice, evidently ignored by the authors of the S \[southern manuscripts of the Rāmāyaṇa\] passage, is, however, clearly present in the minds of the commentators. Thus Cm \[the Tattvadīpikā commentary of Maheśvaratīrtha\] glosses the word paṭhan, ‘reading or reciting,’ which applies to all four social classes, as brāhmaṇāc chṛṇvan, ‘hearing from a brahman,’ only in the case of the śūdras. See crit. notes, p. 428. Cases such as this are interesting not only for the light they shed on the social history of ancient and medieval India, but for the information they provide about the relationship of the two principal recensions of the text. It would appear that the medieval commentators and the transmitters of N alike are struck by what seems to them a social impropriety and seek to rectify it in the light of their own perceptions of what is correct. This is an excellent example of the quasi-commentarial nature of many N readings and tends to confirm the critical editors’ judgment that S often retains the older readings. Since the reading of N and the interpretation of Cm are later than that of S, they would tend to confirm our notion that the tradition’s conception of the immutability of caste and class function grew more rigid after the period in which the epics were first written.”



My observation is that the Goldman translation of the Rāmāyaṇa was intended to introduce the world outside of India to the Rāmāyaṇa. Only a small minority of these readers would know that a śūdra is the lowest caste, if Goldman had not used the word “lowly” here, and that quarter of the verse would make less sense. In the larger picture, Goldman’s work has given thousands of westerners an appreciation of the Rāṃāyaṇa, a book that most of them would otherwise never have even heard of.

  

Best regards,
