You went back to my post on Apr 17 and said :

You added:

You mentioned 'singularity' of an expression in the case of S'udras. The fact of that group being comprised of sub-groups has been highlighted to explain that 'singularity'.

  

Talking about four distinct groups is not at all in contradiction with the issue of sub-groups. One of the four distinct groups is made up of sub-groups.

  

You listed various s'lokas mentioning sēvā in the case of s'ūdras. Thissēvā is not a single activity. It consists of several different activities. So a single feature like vāgriṣabhatvam, bhūmipatitvam or paṇyaphalatvam can not be mentioned. mahattvam is for such different activities whatvāgriṣabhatvam, bhūmipatitvam or paṇyaphalatvam etc. for each of the single activities with which of the remaining varṇas is associated.

  

-------------------------------------

  

Now let us come to the word sēvā. You too used the word serve , service etc. as the English equivalent of this. Is 'lowly' the only way of looking at 'serving' 'service' etc. in the contemporary society ?

  

The activities of the s'ūdras have been viewed to be as foundational to the life of the remaining three varṇas as legs are to the remaining human body comprising of the head, shoulders and the trunk. Such a view is evident from the Purusha Sukta description of the fourvarṇasthrough the analogy of the human body.
