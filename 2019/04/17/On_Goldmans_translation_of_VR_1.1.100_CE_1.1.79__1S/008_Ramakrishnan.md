'janaś ca śūdro 'pi mahattvam īyāt'

  

would normally mean'even a commonśūdra...'

  

Why is the learned professor trying to make a commonśūdra'lowly' to exaggerate the author's statement/intent?

  

A commonśūdra need not be lowly to attain mahattvam, perfectly ordinary people can attain mahattvam without having ever been lowly.
