Dear Dr. Misra,  
  
It would be a good thing to attempt to understand the intended meaning of a given text (translation, message) first instead of primarily searching for potential or factual mistakes.

  
  
  
\> Since in the past you have said you do not quote without agreeing  
  

What I had actually written, is: "If I had not agreed with Kangle's **translation**, I would not have quoted it." In the case of Delbrück and Oberlies I had only given the references for a specific linguistic theory or standpoint primarily in order to show that things are not as easy (and that Goldman's translation is not as childish) as it may seem to you. If you are interested in it, you will read the pages I referred to.  
  
In the following line of argument, however, I set out that it is irrelevant *in the given context of your criticism* whether we see in *īyāt* a benedictive/precative (*āśirliṅ*) or an optative (*vidhiliṅ*) because “\[i\]n the Epics the precative \[...\] – originally expressing (intensified) wishes and prayers \[...\] – is used (due to metrical exigencies) as (a) a **common optative** and (b) a hortative imperative” (Thomas Oberlies, Grammar of Epic Sanskrit, Berlin, New York 2003, p. 143, § 6.2.4, with further evidence). This may not be acceptable to a Pāṇinian grammarian, but as an Indologist I am first and foremost interested in the *factual* usage of words, forms, etc. in a given text (here: the *Rāmāyāṇa*) the language of which may correspond to Pāṇini's rules (or to a non-Pāṇinian grammatical school or tradition) more or less in its entirety or merely to a certain extent.

  
  
\> Now can you confirm if you still agree with the Debrunner and Oberlies or do you  
\> think Pāṇini is more reliable?  
  

Pāṇini "thought strictly synchronically, not historically", Hartmut Scharfe writes correctly in his book "Grammatical Literature" (Wiesbaden 1977, p. 107), whereas modern comparative linguistics (as well as Indology) is a *historical* discipline. This is meant merely as an observation without any assessment. For many reasons, it is not advisable to play them off against each other.

  
  
\> What is this root*ī*(with the long vowel)?  
  

Are you interested in historical linguistics? The root *ī* "is a 'secondary' root \[...\] which is also attested in the absolutive *anvīya* \[...\] and in *adhi-√ī* 'to study'" (Oberlies, op. cit., p. 208, with further evidence). "*adhi-√ī* is extrapolated from the participle *adhīyant*- (cf. A\[lt\]i\[ndische\] G\[rammatik\] I, *Nachträge* p. 55 \[*ad* 95,5-11\]). This seems to be a transformation of ª*adhi-yant-* under the influence of (3sg.) *adhīte* (or else the model was that of denominatives in °*īyant-* \[...\]" (Oberlies, op. cit., p. 208, n. 6).  
  
\> If \*janaḥ\* is lowly, why is \*vaṇigjanaḥ \*in the same verse not “a lowly  
\> vaishya” but \*śūdraḥ \*\*janaḥ\* “a lowly I shudra”.  
  
I quoted Apte s.v. *janaḥ*: "6 A low man, the mob". You see that Apte records "a low man, the mob" as the 6th meaning of the word *janaḥ*. Hence, he must have listed at least five additional (divergent) meanings of the same word. Moreover, *vaṇigjanaḥ* "merchants (collectively)" or "a trader" is an established compound attested to elsewhere. Anyway, the translation "lowly" can be justified by various reasons, among others by the use of *api* "even", which contrasts the supposed lowness of a Śūdra with the achievable "greatness".  
  
One *final* remark (I mean it). There is not a single exclusive way of translating in a proper way. First, one has to ask: **What** was translated (including the date, local origin, and genre of the text, etc.)? **When** was it translated, **why (for what reason), to which end, in which way,** and, **for whom**? Depending on how these questions are answered, a good translation will turn out in a different or even in a very different way.  
  
Best,  
Roland Steiner
