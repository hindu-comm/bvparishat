That would be true, if there were the same structure in all four pādas. This, however, is not the case which is indicated by the small word *api*.  
  
In Sanskrit literature, "eloquence", "political power", and "property" are typically connected with Brāhmaṇas, Kṣatriyas, and Vaiśyas, respectively. However, "greatness" and *śūdratva* are regarded as opposite poles. There are myriads of examples of this. Suffice it to quote *Bhagavadgītā* 18.44 (ed. Belvalkar):  
  
*kṛṣigorakṣyavāṇijyaṃ vaiśyakarma svabhāvajam  
paricaryātmakaṃ karma śūdrasyāpi svabhāvajam*  
  
Or, *Manusmṛti* 1.91:  
  
*ekam eva tu śūdrasya prabhuḥ karma samādiśat  
eteṣām eva varṇānāṃ śuśrūṣām anasūyayā*  
"One occupation only the Lord prescribed to the *śūdra*, to serve meekly even these (other) three castes" (transl. Georg Bühler)  
  
I refrain from quoting more drastic statements. The special status of a Śūdra (in relation to the three other varṇas) is also reflected in the variant reading *śṛṇvan hi* (instead of *janaś ca*), presupposing that a Śūdra is not allowed to read or recite the *Rāmāyaṇa*. Compare, for instance, *Mahābhārata* (crit. ed.) 5.9.24:  
  
*paricaryā vandanaṃ brāhmaṇānāṃ  
**nādhīyīta** pratiṣiddho 'sya yajñaḥ  
nityotthito bhūtaye 'tandritaḥ syād  
eṣa smṛtaḥ śūdradharmaḥ purāṇaḥ*  
  
You will know the case of the *tapasvī* Śambūka which is told in the *Uttarakāṇḍa* of the *Rāmāyaṇa.* Rāma asks him:  
  
*brāhmaṇo vāsi bhadraṃ te kṣatriyo vāsi durjayaḥ  
vaiśyo vā yadi vā śūdraḥ satyam etad bravīhi me* (crit. ed.: 7.66.17)  
  
Śambūka's answer:  
  
*śūdrayonyāṃ prasūto 'smi tapa ugraṃ samāsthitaḥ  
devatvaṃ prārthaye rāma saśarīro mahāyaśaḥ* (7.67.2)  
  
Consequently, Rāma decapitates the Śūdra Śambūka:  
  
*bhāṣatas tasya śūdrasya khaḍgaṃ suruciraprabham  
niṣkṛṣya kośād vimalaṃ śiraś ciccheda rāghavaḥ* (7.67.4)  
  
Which is regarded as praiseworthy by the authorities.  
  
Compare *Mahābhārata* (crit. ed.) 12.149.62:  
  
*śrūyate śambuke śūdre hate brāhmaṇadārakaḥ  
jīvito dharmam āsādya rāmāt satyaparākramāt*  
  
Kisari Mohan Ganguli, the extremely meritorious translator of *the Mahābhārata*, comments on this:  
  
"The allusion is to the story of Rama having restored a dead Brahmana boy. During Rama’s righteous reign there were no premature deaths in his kingdom. It happened, however, one day that a Brahmana father came to Rama’s court and complained of the premature death of his son. Rama instantly began to enquire after the cause. Some sinful act in some corner of the kingdom, it was suspected, had caused the deed. Soon enough Rama discovered a Sudra of the name Samvuka engaged in the heart of a deep forest in ascetic penances. The king instantly cut off the man’s head inasmuch as a Sudra by birth had no right to do what that man was doing. As soon as righteousness was upheld, the deceased Brahmana boy revived." (Ganguli, *The Mahabharata*, Vol. 3, New Delhi: Munshiram Manoharlal, 4th Impression 2008, p. 338, n. 1)
