Dear Paturiji,

  

I do not subscribe to any religion and neither to 'Hinduism'. In spite of this the contributions that this land has made towards humanity is mind boggling. In spite of the shortcomings the way in which the people of this land responded to various oppressions both internal and external in the past two or more millennium makes me feel proud to own such a past.

  

Those as you say who have given up their religion their first priority must be to thoroughly criticize what they have disowned and why they think it needs to be disowned.

  

That's all.

  

Paturiji I understand your position as a moderator.  I will surely try to moderate myself in the future.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
