Dear sirs,

  

I may look naive but I think we can leave Goldman alone because some of our translations are also faulty. There is also some truth in the saying that any publicity is good publicity. Ramayana is popularized, yes. Ramayana's charm would certainly work on many of its readers.

Pollock seems to be different as seen from the quotes in Rajiv Malhotra's book about the battle for Sanskrit. Concerned scholars can do a complete study of his translation and expose it if any agenda is established.

But I always feel bad that we have not created a battle for Latin, Greek or Hebrew.
