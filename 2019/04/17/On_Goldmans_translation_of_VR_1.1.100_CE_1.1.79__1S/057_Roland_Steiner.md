Dear Professor Paturi,

  
  
\> the poet chose to use the common goal of all the sub-groups, mahattvam in the skill of each of the sub-group.  
  

That differs from what you explained earlier: "The mentioned phala for each varNa, in the verse, is the characteristic of the varNa as per the convention. Thus mahattvam is mentioned as the characteristic of s'udra."  
  
Professor Kannan mentioned the "criterion of symmetry" which "ought not to be sacrificed unless there are strong grounds to the contrary." The poet is talking of four distinct groups in each of the four pādas. The stanza is not about sub-groups.  
  
Compare, for instance, the following Ślokas (arbitrarily taken from different literary genres):  
  
brāhmaṇasya tapo jñānaṃ tapaḥ kṣatrasya rakṣaṇam  
vaiśyasya tu tapo vārtā tapaḥ śūdrasya sevanam (*Manusmṛti* 11.235)  
  
śaucena labhate vipraḥ kṣatriyo vikrameṇa ca  
vaiśyaḥ puruṣakāreṇa śūdraḥ śuśrūṣayā śriyam (*Mahābhārata* 13.6.16)  
  
jñānaśreṣṭho dvijaḥ pūjyaḥ kṣatriyo balavān api  
dhanadhānyādhiko vaiśyaḥ śūdras tu dvijasevayā (*Hitopadeśa* 4.26)  
  
These are *typical* statements with regard to content and structure (four pādas, four varṇas, no "sub-groups") which could be easily multiplied. According to these textual sources, the specific "skill" of a Śūdra is *sevanam/sevā* ("service") and *śuśrūṣā* ("obedience") to Dvijas, certainly not *mahattvam* in general.  
  
Or, one could say that a Śūdra is regarded as having no specific skills at all. There are a lot of similar sayings of the following type:  
  
balajyeṣṭhaṃ smṛtaṃ kṣatraṃ mantrajyeṣṭhā dvijātayaḥ  
dhanajyeṣṭhāḥ smṛtā vaiśyāḥ śūdrās tu vayasādhikāḥ (*Mahābhārata* 5.165.15)  
  
Please note the adversative particle *tu* in the final pāda (compare *śūdro 'pi* in *Rāmāyaṇa* 1.1.79).  
  
  
Best,  
Roland Steiner
