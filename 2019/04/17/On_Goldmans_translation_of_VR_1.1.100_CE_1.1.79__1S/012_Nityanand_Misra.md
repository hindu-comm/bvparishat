Dear Dr. Steiner

  

Since in the past you have said you do not quote without agreeing, I assume you agree with the position of Debrunner and Oberlies. Kālidāsa says in *Mālavikāgnimitram*: *mūḍhaḥ parapratyayaneyabuddhiḥ*. Since we (you and I) are not*mūḍha*s, let us discard the conviction of Debrunner and Oberlies and try to convince ourselves. Here is whatMādhavīyā Dhātuvṛtti says*iṇ gatau*

  

*vidhiliṅ*: *iyāt*

*āśīrliṅ*: *īyāt*

  

Again, since we are not*mūḍha*s, let us discard this also and go straight to what Pāṇini himself says. Two rules should suffice

  

*liṅāśiṣi*

*akṛtsārvadhātukayordīrghaḥ*

  

An understanding ofthese two rules would make it clear that the*vidhiliṅ* form(is that what you call *optative*?) is*iyāt* with the short initial vowel and the*āśīrliṅ*form is*īyāt* with the long initial vowel. Now can you confirm if you still agree with theDebrunner and Oberlies or do you think Pāṇini is more reliable?

If *janaḥ*is lowly, why is *vaṇigjanaḥ* in the same verse not“a lowly vaishya” but*śūdraḥjanaḥ***“a lowly shudra”. Arvind Sharma has a point, after all.
