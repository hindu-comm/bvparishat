That would be true, if there were the same structure in all four pādas. This, however, is not the case which is indicated by the small word*api*.  

  

----- Exactly the same small word api brings equality of the structure, rather emphasises the equivalence of the structure because it means in the same way as the other three, this varNa too.

  

For example,

  

Just as Brahmins are being blessed to get Vaagrishabhatvam

  

Kshatriyas are being blessed to get Bhoomipatitvam

  

Vaishyas are being blessed to get Punyaphalatvam

  

S'udras too (api) are being blessed to get Mahattvam.

  

Thus it is that very small word 'api' which is communicating equality by signifying the meaning just as ....... X too.
