Sometimes this discussion sounds like Vishnu Sharma's efforts in training the king's children.

Any part of education needs a desire for the "student" to know. The king's child has a right

to think that the teacher is an employee. Some education may take place by one-to-one  

teacher-student teaching in the teacher's home. Otherwise there is little chance!
