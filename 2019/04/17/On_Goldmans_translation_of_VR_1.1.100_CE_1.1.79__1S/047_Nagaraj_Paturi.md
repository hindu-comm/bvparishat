\> And that is the very reason why*api*means "even", not "too", in*Rāmāyaṇa*1.1.79.  

  

---- Your quote from a commentary can not lead to Valimiki ***means*** that by his verse. It can only imply that the commentator sees that verse that way.

  

We are discussing what Valimiki means. Not what a vyaakhyaataa means.

  

---------------------------

  

In discussing the textual ideas vs reality, my focus was on Sri Nityanand-ji's thread initiating post and his mention of the scope for the misuse of the words like 'lowly' by the contemporary maligners of Ramayana. Such defamers of texts publicise that the contemporary reality is caused by the content of those texts.

  

In view of that highlighting the difference and disconnect between the social order discussed in the text and the the social order in reality becomes pertinent and essential.

  

In spite of scholars like David Buxbaum declaring that

  

"in the opinion of the best contemporary orientalists, it \[Manusmriti\] does not, as a whole, represent a set of rules ever actually administered in Hindustan. It is in great part an ideal picture of that which, in the view of a Brahmin, ought to be law".

  

In spite of Donald Davis concluding that

  

"there is no historical evidence for either an active propagation or implementation of Dharmasastra \[Manusmriti\] by a ruler or any state – as distinct from other forms of recognizing, respecting and using the text. Thinking of Dharmasastra as a legal code and of its authors as lawgivers is thus a serious misunderstanding of its history"

  

aren't people holding this book responsible for the social realities in the present Indian society?

  

In view of such precedencesmisuse of mistranslations of texts was suspected.

  

The highlighting of the difference between the system in the texts and the system in reality was necessitated in view of such valid apprehensions.

  

------------------------

  

The argument of essentiality of words such as 'lowly' is based on the idea that the system of four varNas is essentially hierarchical. Highlighting of the non-essentiality of hierarchy to the concept of varNa system becomes necessary because of that. As a matter of course, the hierarchy not being the defining feature of even the social system of caste with which the varNa system is wrongly conflated is also mentioned.
