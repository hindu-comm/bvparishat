1\. It should not be too difficult to see the formal difference between the two verb forms *īyāt* und *eti*, even for a *mleccha* Indologist. The only question is how to analyze and to interpret the form *īyāt*. According to Debrunner and Oberlies, *īyāt* is not the benedictive (or, precative) of the root *i*, but actually the optative of the root *ī* (for details see Albert Debrunner, Nachträge zu Jakob Wackernagel, Altindische Grammatik Band 1, Göttingen 1957, p. 55 ad 95, 5-11; Thomas Oberlies, A Grammar of Epic Sanskrit, p. 393, rem. (c)). We need not discuss this matter any further, because “\[i\]n the Epics the precative \[...\] – originally expressing (intensified) wishes and prayers \[...\] – is used (due to metrical exigencies) as (a) a **common optative** and (b) a hortative imperative” (Oberlies, op. cit., p. 143, § 6.2.4, with further evidence). Hence, both as an optative and as an Epic benedictive, *īyāt* can principally adopt the following meanings: “he/she/it can (could) / may (might) / will (would) / shall (should) / must go” or “obtain”. In the given context of the *Rāmāyaṇa*, the interpretation “will become eloquent” etc. appears plausible to me, especially if we take a look at the two preceding stanzas (*idaṃ pavitraṃ pāpaghnaṃ puṇyaṃ vedaiś ca saṃmitam / yaḥ paṭhed rāmacaritaṃ sarvapāpaiḥ pramucyate* \[*Rām*. 1.1.77\] *etad ākhyānam āyuṣyaṃ paṭhan rāmāyaṇaṃ naraḥ / saputrapautraḥ sagaṇaḥ pretya svarge mahīyate* \[1.1.78\]) in which two verb forms in the present tense (*pramucyate*, *mahīyate*) are used. From this perspective, Goldman’s use of the present tense in his *English* translation (“becomes eloquent”) is only a matter of style.  
  
One may dispute the underlying linguistic analysis or the interpretation and may disagree with the translation, but it is simply poor to say that Goldman commits a “schoolboy error“ by insinuating that he is incapable of making a distinction between *īyāt* and *eti*.  
  
2. *janaś ca śūdro 'pi mahattvam īyāt* “And an \[ordinary\] man, even a Śūdra, will/might attain greatness” (my translation), "and even a lowly *śūdra* achieves greatness” (transl. Goldman). Presumably, "lowly" is Goldman's translation of *janaḥ* (Apte s.v. *janaḥ*: "6 A low man, the mob") or could have been added by him in order to make the underlying idea clearer to the reader. Reading the *Rāmāyaṇa* is auspicious to such an extent, that even (*api*) a man who is born into the lowest *varṇa* will attain greatness which is certainly not regarded as the usual “characteristic of s'udra.” Quite the contrary.
