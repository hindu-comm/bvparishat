Not a PhD, so please spare the Dr.

The devil is in the details. It would be a good thing to get the details right first, before jumping to conclusions. This is what you wrote

  

According to Debrunner and Oberlies,*īyāt*is not the benedictive (or, precative) of the root*i*, but actually the optative of the root*ī*  

  

I showed you exactly how*īyāt* is the benedictive/*āśīrliṅ*form of*iṇ gatau* (*vidhiliṅ*:*iyāt,āśīrliṅ*:*īyāt*). You chose to conveniently ignore my point which disproved what you claimed. You mentioned the root*ī*, which is nothing but*iṅ adhyayane*(*nityamadhipūrvaḥ*) inthe*Dhātupāṭha*. For*iṅ adhyayane*, the forms are*vidhiliṅ*:*adhīyīta* and*āśīrliṅ*:*adhyeṣīṣṭa*. And there is alsoik smaraṇe (also*nityamadhipūrvaḥ*) for which the forms are*vidhiliṅ*:*adhīyāt* and*āśīrliṅ*:*adhīyāt*. I can derive all these forms. You claimed on the basis of your source that*īyāt*is not the benedictive (or, precative) of the root*i*. Either your source is deficient and incomplete, or your understanding is. In either case, you lowered the quality of this debate by making a false claim which has been disproved and you did not even have the courtesy to own up your mistake. I have nothing else to say here except that you should refer to complete sources on verbal forms or learn*dhātuprakriyā* before commenting on such issues. I can send you a list of references if you want.

This is nothing new. The commentaries byPāṇinians have many interpretations which say things like*atra laḍarthe loṭ* (even in non-Vedic texts)*.* And still, none of the commentaries on the*Rāmāyāṇa* thatI am aware of have made such an interpretation for the verse in question. It is not intelligent to blindly apply a theory everywhere, but one needs to critically think about the context of the verse.

Spare the sarcasm, Dr. Steiner. As I said, this root is nothing but*iṅ adhyayane*(*nityamadhipūrvaḥ*) inthe*Dhātupāṭha*. I do not need to learn historical linguistics to understand a difference in notation (*ī* in your email versus*iṅ* in the*Dhātupāṭha*). It is a senseless thing to say,

Add one more question. **Who** translated it. If that person has a deeply ingrained tendency toaccentuate the differences between the shudra and other varnas(as Prof. Arvind Sharma says), it makes a difference.

  

Thanks, Nityananda
