Food for thought (epilogue)  
  
The three "fruits" of the three upper varṇas are, according to *Rāmāyaṇa* 1.1.79 (crit ed.): *vāgṛṣabhatvam*, *bhūmipatitvam*, and *paṇyaphalatvam* - three very *specific* "fruits", attributed exclusively to each single varṇa.  
  
The fourth "fruit", however, is a *general* one: *mahattvam* which could be attributed to each and everyone, which, by the way, is a further indicator of the singularity of the fourth and last Pāda in comparison to the first three Pādas of *Rāmāyaṇa* 1.1.79 (crit ed.) corresponding to the singularity of the fourth varṇa in comparison to the first three varṇas.  
  
What "fruit", however, could be regarded as specific for Śūdras, analogous to *vāgṛṣabhatvam*, *bhūmipatitvam*, and *paṇyaphalatvam* being specific "fruits" for Brāhmaṇas, Kṣatriyas, and Vaiśyas respectively? *śreṣṭhatraivarṇikadāsatvam*? Being a most excellent servant of the three upper varṇas?
