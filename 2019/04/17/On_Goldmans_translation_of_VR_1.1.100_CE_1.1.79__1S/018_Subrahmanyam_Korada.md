नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

Counterexample:  
  
athāhaṃ dṛṣṭavān \[...\]  
kālakākolavalayam ... (Mokṣopāya VI.15.23-24)  
  
"Then I (Vasiṣṭha) saw a flock (valaya) of black (kāla) ravens (kākola)."  

  

The point is this --

  

if the speaker has got a विवक्षा (to show something specifically or highlight some aspect ) or if he simply follows सामान्यविशेषभाव or if he exhibits अनादर and in वर्णना etc then there will be such usages --

  

महर्षिः नारदः - पाकं पचति - द्वौ अपूपौ , कमलानि कमलानि , नीलमाकाशम्
etc

In all the above examples the first word is a विशेषण of the latter .

  

Such issues are available in plenty in works like महाभाष्यम् and its commentaries, लघुमञ्जूषा etc .

If there is any specific विवक्षा -- that too for a translator - as he is supposed to be faithful to the original - then it is okay - I do not see any such विवक्षा on the part of the translator - for people of other cultures I suggested something in parenthesis rather than using a विशेषणम् - the reader , as I mentioned as another problem , may think that it is only for 'a low Sudra' and not for 'a high Sudra' - the विशेषणम् should not be counterproductive - in fact, in tradition there is this kind of - सच्छूद्र and असच्छूद्र (धर्मशास्त्रेषु ) \|

  

जनश्च शूद्रोऽपि महत्त्वमीयात्  

even a Sudra (जाति - the gamut of Sudras - is the meaning ) can get greatness .

If you say ' a lowly Sudra ' then you are dividing the जाति , by which the intended meaning of the poet is certainly lost - no big discussion is required to grasp this point.

  

The word जन -- शूद्रजनो॑पि - can also become a counterexample ! - but it is inserted for metrical reasons .

  

प्रयुक्तानाम् अन्वाख्यानम् -- there are already some usages and we have to analyse them - always there are rules followed by exceptions .

  

धन्यो॑स्मि
