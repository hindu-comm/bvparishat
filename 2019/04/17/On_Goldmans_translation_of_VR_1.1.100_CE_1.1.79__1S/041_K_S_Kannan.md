1\. I had missed the *kirAtArjunIya* references, for which thanks.

I appreciate the attestation.  

  

2\. But then, that the word *jana* as such and by itself could only poorly convey the ordinariness

is exactly made out by the commentator, and by means of the very expressions I surmised  

viz. *pRthag-jana* and *prAkRta\[-jana\],* which goes to confirm my very point of the rarity of such usage.  

  

3\. Prosodial necessities or love of brevity sometimes inspire court poets to use truncated expressions.

But the vast canvas of vAlmIki - of well over a score of a thousand verses - sees no need to be weary of prolixity.  

  

4\. I had already set forth how *jana* is pitted against *narapati,  
*

and so no new point is being made out after all*,* by the citation from *kirAtArjunIya*,  

where *jana* is pitted against the very slightly different word *rAjaka,  
*

which is indeed semantically hardly different, and hence in no wise substantially alters my point.*  
*

  

5\. The **criterion of symmetry** ought not to be sacrificed *unless* there are strong grounds to the contrary.

If *vaNig-jana* involves *jana* in a neutral sense, so does *s'Udra-jana* occurring in the very next pAda and withe same semantic force/role.

There is the difference of course between the two in that while the first one is a compound-word, the other is not;  

but then, there is no rule that an expression like this means one thing if compounded,  

and quite another when uncompounded.  

  

6\. Further, poets are not unknown to exploit the principle of Elegant Variation

even while keeping within certain bounds of symmetry.  

  

7. There is no great or novel point being made out by Steiner  

that in the *varNa*-scheme prevalent in ancient times, and from times immemorial,  

the *s'Udra* was at one end of the spectrum.  

  

Nevertheless, within the system that was fairly stable for millennia (and deemed equitable on whatever grounds),  

each *varNa* had abundant scope to aspire to excellence in the available scheme of things.

What vAlmIki is showing is that this *attainment of excellence was a common benefit*  

that every *varNa* could aspire for, *each though in its own mould,* yet through a common protocol.   

(Prof. Paturi has already drawn our attention to this).  

  

8\. Those who have quarrel with the very beliefs or the social system of those times can choose other arenas to raise issues,

and to push their agenda in the name of, or under the scheme of, a translation is hardly fair.

**A fair translation ought to reflect the heart of the original writer** rather than that of the translator.  

  

9\. The kind act of exonerating Goldman for translating *jana* as *lowly* is highly appreciated,  

even though it is not clarified wherefrom then has the word been imported.  

And on the contrary, if it is indeed so justifiable, why divest Goldman of the credit for the rendering?  

Such endeavours almost sound hagiographical, nothing more.  

  

10. The confirmation that the *elementary* meaning of *api* as "And, also, too, moreover, besides, in addition"  

is revealed so as to help " calm everybody preventively".

But then, this was what was stated by me *in the very opening sentence*.  

Would not a concession to this effect at the outset avert a protracted debate?  

  

11\. My whole point is :  

rather than **take the simple and direct sense** (viz. *jana*=folk) which is *so compatible and consonant in the context*,

resorting to ruses and sophistry to import or impart a strained sense, coupled by struggling to defend it  

seems verily an avoidable exercise.
