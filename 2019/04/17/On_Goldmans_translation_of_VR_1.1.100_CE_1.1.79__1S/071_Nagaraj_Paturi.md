\> I am primarily interested in history and accurate historical research based on evidence, or, in simple words: I am primarily interested in what human beings have actually done, thought and said, and why.

  

--- That is exactly where historical studies particularly the textualist ones , i.e., the ones which blindly/uncritically consider what is siad as what is done, have been going wrong repeatedly. They have been taking what is said as 'evidence' for what happened or what is done.

  

Another problem is trying to connect pieces of texts dealing with totally unconnected topics:

  

Let us take your quote from*Vāsiṣṭhasmṛti*

  

You quote a verse which does not talk about either 'lowly', hierarchical /stratificational status of 'S'udra' which is the topic on hand or seva or service aspect that you bring into discussion but talks about using very rare spiteful descriptions of S'udra absolutely not connected to the topic on hand. That quote does not support any of the questions on hand.

  

Since that is a total digression from the topic, I don't want to continue that discussion any further.

Coming to the the relation between the Gunas as Sattva, Rajas and Tamas and the Varnas, there was a long discussion on BVP about how attempting to make such connections itself is highly problematic.

Once we see the Organic body form understanding of mutual dependence from the Purusha Sukta and any later derogatory descriptions towards any varNa , we can only conclude that the descriptions contradict such an organic view of the four varNas and hence as relative to Veda not praamaaNika.

  

Since you requested to allow one last of your lasts, and it has been allowed let us close this discussion on this controversial translation here.
