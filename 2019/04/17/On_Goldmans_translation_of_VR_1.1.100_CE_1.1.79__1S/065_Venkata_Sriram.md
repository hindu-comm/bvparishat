Namaste Nagaraj Garu,

  

Couple of months ago, I met a gentleman who was from a place called 'Yerpedu' near Tirupati. He narrated an incident that brought tears to my eyes.

  

There used to be a scavenger in their area whose job is to collect the filth & garbage from individual houses and dump a place where the tirupati municipal van comes and picks up the garbage collectively.
That scavenger had a wooden cart and he used to push that from house to house for garbage collection. He used to stop near the gate of the house and used to call the household members by addressing 'Narayana'. He used to say 'Narayana ! please handover the garbage to this Narayana (pointing towards himself) who has come to collect garbage'. This was his daily routine of garbage collection and 'nArAyaNa-smaraNa'.

  

He passed away on Ekadasi with 'nArAyaNa-smaraNa' on his lips and eye witnesses said that his face was beaming with brahma-tejas during final moments.

  

These incidents may not be new to you as yourself & pitrupAda have witnessed many... But since, the word 'lowly' was prefixed before 'sudra', I am reminded of this incident.

  

rgs,

sriram
