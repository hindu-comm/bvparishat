1\. "**And, too, the *s'Udra*-folk....**" would be in keeping with the spirit of the original,

(both *ca* and *api* are paid their natural dues thereby) -  

even as "the old folk" would serve as an apt rendering for  

" *vRddho **jano** duHkha-s'atAni bhun'kte* *.*..".

This was my essential point.  

  

2\. It is no question of polemics.

  

Polemics ensues, or is inspired by, extrapolated renderings unwarranted by the context.

The norm is one of choosing a simpler and more natural sense

rather than a strained one - in contexts of polysemy.

Nobody denies the multiple senses of a word like *jana*  

which, all said, is by no means heavily polysemous still.

  

3\. Equally, there is another situation where *jana* is qualified,

and the qualified word necessarily yields the sense of the ordinary/lowly:

consider ***pRthag-jana*** ( Pali *puthujana*) or ***pres"ya-jana.***  

Sometimes even in the absence of *jana*, its typical adjective (*sans* the substantive) carries that force

\- as in *prAkRta* (Cf. ***yaH kas'cit prAkRta iva*...**") (in lieu of *prAkRta-jana*).

  

4\. Anyone familiar with the usages of the word *jana* in varied contexts can easily discern  

the propriety of an ordinary rendering in the present context (rather than a loaded one).

  

We even get usages such as *daivya jana* in ancient literature.  

Words like *sakhI-jana, suhRj-jana, bandhu-jana, guru-jana, s'vas'rU-jana, bandhu-jana, sva-jana, pari-jana, priya-jana, nir-jana*  

and even *dvijAti-jana* betray its neutral sense, **none pejorative**.*  
*

*  
*

*mahA-jana* can equally mean great men, or the mass of men, the majority.

  

In ***jano'nyathA bhartRmatIm vis'an'kate***, it again means people in general.

So also in ***rAmo nAma janais' s'rutaH*** in the *Ramayana* itself.

  

In ***janAH narapatayas' ca***, there is a contrast with the king, and so refers to citizenry in general.

  

*ayam janaH* is reflexively used by all, irrespective of their status.

In ***janam imam ca pAtayitum*** (the celebrated wordings in the *s'Akuntala*-play),

the king refers to himself as *imam **janam*** !

  

5\. Steiner has only attempted to mislead by citing the meaning of *jana* as "a low man, the mob".

This sense is found neither in Apte's *Students Sanskrit-English Dictionary*,  

nor in Apte's *Practical Sanskrit-English Dictionary.*

*  
*

It is there only in the *Revised and Enlarged* 3-Volume Dictionary edited by Gode & Co.(**1958**).

(VSApte lived during 1858-1892).  

  

And even there, it occurs as *the very last sense*, ***with no citation for attestation*,**

\- but only with the remark LDB (referring to the List of Dineshchandra Bhattacharya).

The last, and immensely rare, sense is then, Goldman's choicest one!  

  

The flimsiest ground is sufficient, therefore, to provide (or equally to commend, or defend) a loaded sense!

  

6\. It is only when the translator is certain that the primary sense is *utterly* inapplicable,

and the extended sense is *the only one* that can do justice to the original,

should he resort to such a secondary sense.  

And it is highly desirable if not imperative that he give justification for the same in the Notes.

  

No such situation warrants here, and Goldman or his followers are not exculpated  

where they flout this norm - inspired by whatever agenda.

  

7\. It is quite another matter that the status of the *s'Udra* was not a high one.

The translator is not expected to exhibit his own expertise of the sociology of  

the times of the text he is translating right in the very translation. He is welcome to pour it in the Notes.

The book is not after all intended for the layman who will never turn to the Notes Section.

Popular renderings sometimes take liberties, and they can be pardoned (provided they too do not cross certain limits).  

  

8\. What the text plainly implies is:  

Not all *dvija*-s are natural *vAgRs"abha*-s;  

not all *s'Udra*-s as such possess *mahattva .*

These are accomplished through unusual efforts usually.*  
*

But paying attention to the epic can impart upon them such attainments (- with quicker, or considerably lesser, efforts,)  

as is covetable for their respective *varNa*-s.

  

And this sense can be easily grasped by the simple and straightforward rendering we have suggested in the opening paragraph.

  

The "lowly" way is not the best way, after all  

\- not at least for one who craves for the title of the best translator.

  

(It is quite another matter that Goldman easily gets a massive audience that loves Hindu-bashing,

especially when camouflaged under an overbearing scholarship).
