I guess the issue is one of right or wrong translations only,

and more particularly, the ones which are agenda-driven or otherwise.

Plus, the ones selling well in the market and thereby  

influencing the intelligent laymen or even the general populace.

  

It does not matter if it issues from the East or the West.

There are many in the West who are well-equipped.

Some of them mean well too.

  

It is the overwhelming quantum of Indological literature that they are producing

*after effectively destroying it at its source*, and the pronounced agenda of some of their "heroes"

that should bother anybody.

  

The institutional infrastructure that has been built systematically, and the consistent  

**collusion of academia** with their political/military/industrial/commercial/evangelizing/propagandist industries

with not necessarily very decent aspirations that should worry every non-Western nation.  

  

Kalidasa would today have perhaps cautioned:

***pAs'cAttyam ity eva na sAdhu sarvam !***

*** na cApi paurastyam iti pradus"Tam \|***

and would have retained the latter half as such:

****santaH parIks'yAnyatarad bhajante****

*** mUDhaH para-pratya-neya-buddhiH \|\|***

***
