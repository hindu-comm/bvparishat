There is an interesting concept called 'sāmānya-viśeṣa-siddhānta' in Ayurveda. It is similarity and dissimilarity of substances, discussed differently in Vaiseshika. The thumb rule is this -

सर्वदा सर्वभावानां सामान्यं वृद्धिकारणम् ।

ह्रासहेतुर्विशेषश्च प्रवृत्तिरुभयस्य तु ।। C.S. 1.1.44

*Continuous use ofdravya,gunaorkarmawhich are similar to the body constituents, results in the increase of them. Whereas, continuous use of dissimilardravya, gunaandkarma, result in the decrease of them.*  

  

For example, consumption/external supply of flesh increases themāṃsa-dhātu in body. If one is a non-vegetarian, it can be substituted with the urad dal to achieve desired result - this isdravya-sāmānya; flesh increases flesh.

  

Similarly, blood increases blood. In complications of bleeding (virecana), Caraka refers to*jeeva-rakta* (functioning blood). When this*jeeva-rakta* is evacuated totally and the patient is fainting, oral administration of blood of deer/goat/buffalo is prescribed. As, "that will sustain life *because blood of animals gets immediately transformed to the human*." (Source of translation is from this [link](http://www.carakasamhitaonline.com).)

  

According topariśeṣa-nyāya, based on above theory, one can imagine transfusion of blood in humans is proscribed or not.

  

Conversely, ancient vaidyas did not talk about blood groupings. What they said was, color of the blood changes depending on theprakṛti of a person. That's it!

I found this query quite interesting. The above sāmānya/similarity theory may apply here too. On a positive side, think about employing adhātrī (wet nurse) and subsequent physical/mental changes in infants. Kalidasa talks aboutdhātrī in Raghuvamsam.
