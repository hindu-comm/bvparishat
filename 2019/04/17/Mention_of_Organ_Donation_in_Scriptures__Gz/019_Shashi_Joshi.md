Also, if I may add, we can't say that the ancient shAstras are the only thing we can look upto. Our own intelligence has to be employed, *guided by the spirit of shAstra* to solve problems and dilemmas of our times.

  

*yasya nAsti svayam praj\~nA* comes to mind again and again. Our tradition is one that is not stagnant, was not supposed to be. That is why truths were told again and again in various smritis and purANas, same way it needs to be done for our changed times as well, with guidance from the spirit of the messages in our shAstra.  
  

  
Thanks,  
Shashi
