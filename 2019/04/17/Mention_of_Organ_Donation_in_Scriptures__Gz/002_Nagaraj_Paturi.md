Thumb rule in such matters could be

  

1.proscribed action not to be performed

  

2.prescribed action should be performed

  

3\. Action neither proscribed not prescribed to be chosen based on

  

  a. the spirit behind prescriptions and proscriptions

  

  b. one's own wisdom guided by human/philanthropic/altruistic values not in contradiction with the spirit behind prescriptions and proscriptions

-----------------------------------

  

Not prescribed is to be avoided is not the right principle.
