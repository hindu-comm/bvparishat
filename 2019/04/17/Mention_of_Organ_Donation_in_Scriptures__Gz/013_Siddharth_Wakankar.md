Organ donation was not thought of in those days or was not required to be specifically mentioned because it seems it was not necessary in those days when almost every individual was physically fit and following the ayurvedic and dharmik way of life and was not much addicted to any kind of vyasanas or distractions which the modern man is prone to. This could be the reason why these things were not mentioned.  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
