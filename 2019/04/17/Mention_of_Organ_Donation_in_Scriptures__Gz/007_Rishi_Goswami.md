Thank you Nagataj ji and Subrahmanyam ji and all Vidvajjana for help.

I would still be wanting to know weather this is mentioned by name or kriya somewhere in the Puranas or Smritis.

Because, There is much complications here.  
The answer for Karma is clear, there are thousands of thibgs we give and take on a daily basis, we shouldn't worry about those and let the authorities in sky decide our fates.  
What we should keep doing is good karma.

Say, I am a Brahmana, I take Pindadana or Annadana on any occasions, I shouldn't be worried of repaying it, for it would happen automatically. If I keep doing good karma, which is my duty, like teaching and learning as a Brahmana, I am completing my duties.  
Yes, the 5 Rinas are important though, for that we should do trikal sandhya, vishwedev karma, shraaddhas on regular punyatithis and in pitripaksha, help humans and preserve nature and study the Shastras.

The thing about Prescribed and Prohibited is based on our Dhee. Dharma has 6 Angas, = Desha Kaala Dravya Kartri Mantra and Karma.  
"Ya eva dharmah so'dharmah adeshakale vyavasthitah." So precribed and prohibited are to be based on the aforementioned 6 factors. That is something a Vidvan has to choose in Djarma Sankat.

But, the question still remains. Is blood donation or organ donation, prescribed or prohibited? Or it isnt mentioned at all? Based on this information, a Viveki can decide based on Deshadi factors according to his Dhee.  
  
Dadhichi donated to Indra. True, but the complication is that is there anything like inserting the organ inside your body? Indra used it as a weapon, but should we take someone else's blood inside our body?

Like we (we as in traditional Hindus like my family) don't even allow touching of two plates after we start eating. Or, we don't touch anything without washing hands. We don't eat outside food for this main reason that there is no Achara-Vichara outside.

In that case, taking someone elses blood? Who that person is? Is he a Duratma? Will his karma affect mine? Or we are prohibited to eat Tamasic food to prevent Tamasic Manovritti, similarly, what if he was a Tamasic man? Will his blood affect us in any way?

But leaving aside those complications, let us just focus on 1 thing. Is it prescribed? Prohibited? Or none?

If any Vidvan has read something in Smritis or Puranas, please say \_/\\\_.
