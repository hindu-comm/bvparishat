Namaste,

  

All these dharma-shastras & philosophies vanish when the sufferings come to oneself / one's family. If any of our dearest family members (son / daughter / mother / father / wife) need blood / organs, then IMHO we run to blood banks and seek help from donors !

  

The best judge is one's own conscience ....

  

**आत्मौपम्येन** सर्वत्र समं पश्यति योऽर्जुन।  
सुखं वा यदि वा दुःखं सः योगी परमो मतः।। BG - 6.32।।  
  
If we can feel the pain of others as ours by stepping into their shoes and feel their pulse, there is nothing like that.

  

My 2 c..

  

rgs,

sriram
