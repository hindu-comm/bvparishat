Puranic legends only shows this. There is nothing that cannot be given to the great and there need not be any inspiration or prescription or proscription. "Kim adeyam mahatmanam!". And it is not particular about "angadana" or blood donation. This is the intention of the legends as I know. And it is not dependent on whether brahmana or Kshatriya! Only willingness to donate to help others. Dadhica was a Rishi and Bali was demon king. Karna was Kshatriya or he didn't know his caste till his life secret was published.

If any could show any line of smriti or shruti that would better and decisive. Otherwise it will be confusing for goswamy.
