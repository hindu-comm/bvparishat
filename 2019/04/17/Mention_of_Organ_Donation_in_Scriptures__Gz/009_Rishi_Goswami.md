Sashiji, I do appreciate your opinion which is mine as well. But Dharmashastras and Puranas are extremely elaborate and complex.

The less we know, the easily we derive at conclusions, the more one knows, the complications increase and after a lot of self-debate or contemplation, scholars derive at conclusions.

I'm of the opinion to wait for great scholars in this list to read the post and share their respective opinions. If not exact, I'm sure there must be something related they know about and can shed light on this query.

The vastness of our scriptures is such that there are answers to almost all questions and Shushrusha of Vriddhas will help us get to our answers.

Personally, I rarely make any conclusions on any topic. I'm a student and aspire to read as much as possible in 1 lifetime, for reading everything of our scriptures is impossible. So I'm not in an authority to derive at any conclusions right now, hence will wait till I get opinions or read the scriptures myself.

Namaskara \_/\\\_
