I don't think medicine was advanced enough to do organ donation and implants as we do today - like eye, heart, blood, kidney.

I would prefer to be realistic.

  

Also, not everything will be in the shAstra. It is like 'What is the shAstrika stand on usage of cell phone and internet'?

Instead, the question should be on the act done with the help of cell phone and internet - talking, gossiping, stalking, crowdfunding, applying for job, sharing good and bad photos and videos ...

  

The means can change, the end goal and intent is what should be questioned as long as means are not unethical (niti will allow even that!).

So, saving life of another, or making it better is a good thing. If one can do it without harming oneself disproportionately then it should be. Don't we have instances of one giving up life (not just one organ) to save another?

  

One's own well-intended and viveki intellect should never be abandoned even when taking guidance from shAstra.

For *yasya nAsti svayam ...*

  

That is my humble opinion.  

  
  

Thanks,
