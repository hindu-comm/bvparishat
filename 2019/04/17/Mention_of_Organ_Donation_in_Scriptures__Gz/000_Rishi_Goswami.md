Haraye Namah.

Namaste Vidvadgana.

I had a query. Type of curiosity. In your reading of Puranas, Smritis, Ayurveda and other scriptures, is there any mention of Organ Donation or Blood Donation in our scriptures?

If yes, please do share where it has been mentioned. If not, how do we decide the Dharmic perspective of any such thing?

Like potatoes came from foriegn, but now they're an essential part of our daily lifestyle, similarly something which isn't mentioned in our Puranas or Smritis hoe do we decide it's kartavyata or a kartavyata?

Namaskara.
