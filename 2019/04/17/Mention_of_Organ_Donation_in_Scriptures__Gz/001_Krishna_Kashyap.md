Namaskar

asmad gurubhyo namah

  

Thanks for bringing up this question.

Someone with a good knowledge of scriptures told me this:

  

if a person A donates an organ to a person B, it may be possible that B has to repay A eventually and a karmic "i owe you" bandhanamay result for both the receiver as well as the giver, since giver has to receive what was given by him.

This is true for money also.One should not borrow a lot of money since he has to repay.

  

Hence some people do not do organ donation as a rule. However, there may be a bad effect on A who should have donated due to "bhUta dayA" or kindness to a fellow human being. How should we resolve this conflict is a question. I could never ask him this question of this conflict. I would appreciate if anyone can comment on this, with proper scriptural evidence. There is definitely a problem both ways!
