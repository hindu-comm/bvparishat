Thank you to all Vidvadgana.

I'm pretty sure for there's no harm in donating blood/organs, but accepting is still risky.

This question literally arose due to Aatmaupamya. I started donating blood for my grandfather was in the hospital for 6 months, in need of blood always.

So, when I thought about this today, this aspect struck my mind, in form of curiosity that is it prescribed or prohibited or something.

We really don't know who's blood enters our body, we can't really say if he ate beef/pork/prohibited food. So, I've concluded that after a certain time, when body seems fit after all medicine, we should do some Vrata or Prayaschitta and go to some holy river/teertha (Nashik Godavari being closest to my city Mumbai).

Still, I'd mark this as a doubt in my head and would be alert to find such a thing if I come across in some text.

Thankyou also for Ayurvedic Reference.  
Namaskara.
