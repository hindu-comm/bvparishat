# Message on Organ Donation by Shri Visvesha Teertha Swamiji of Shri Pejawar Mutt

  

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1CFQBNF95E>  (it is called 'anga daana')

  

Yet some make a difference between cadaver donation and donation while alive. The former is not favored by some while the latter is approved. The logic is: in the latter case it is possible for the donated organ growing back. In the former case this is not possible and render the body scripturally defective to be offered to agni.

  

In any case, the idea of altruism will take the better of the reasoning.
