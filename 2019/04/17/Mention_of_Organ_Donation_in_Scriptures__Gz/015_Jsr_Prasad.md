May not be true all times. Think of plastic surgery - rhinoplasty till late 18th century documented by a British officer. Implantation of head of Ganesha, Daksha-prajapati etc., are examples in this direction, if we believe inƒÅptavacana.

  

The problem lies in, we always try to trace contemporaneity in ancient things.
