As it seems reasonably clear that the term *aṇūmātrā* in the sense of a quarter *mātrā* is found in various Prātiśākhyas. I would be curious to know if this term or the notion of consonants being *ardhamātrika*is found also in metrics. To my general understanding, beyond saying that a *laghu*akṣara is one mātrā and a *guru* akṣara is two mātrās, the Chandas Śāstra does not count the mātrās of consonants. Any further light on the use of these terms in the Chandas Śāstra is appreciated.
