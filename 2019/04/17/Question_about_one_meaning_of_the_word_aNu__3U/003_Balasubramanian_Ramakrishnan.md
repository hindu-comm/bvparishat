Thank you for the references Prof. Deshpande. The tatittirIya prAtishAkhyam 19.3 and the commentary on it was what set off my doubt. The sUtra 19.3 says dviyama eke dviyamapare tA aNumAtrAH. However it does not explicitly say what an aNumAtrA is. The same goes for the atharva reference as well. But I read through Whitney’s explanations on your suggestion and it points out that “It is upon the authority of the vAjasaneyI prAtishAkhya (1.60) that the term aNumAtrA literally ‘minute measure’, used in our text, is interpreted to signify the definite quantity of a quarter-mora”.

  

The vAjasaneyI reference 1.59 and 1.60 are vya\~njanam-ardhamAtrA, tadardham-aNu.

  

That’s quite clear.

  

Thanks again.

  

Ramakrishnan
