Regarding the definitions of laghu and guru syllables, the usual definition found in the Chandas-shAstra (at least the minimal stuff known to me) is also found in the taittirIya-prAtishAkhyam 22.14 and 22.15. Of course in this case, all the consonants in between 2 vowels belong to the prior vowel, making it guru. In the prAtishAkyam itself there is a different definition of which consonants in a cluster belong to the preceding and following vowels for various reasons. There is also some slightly varying (at least so far in my readings) definitions of the mAtra-s in some shikShA-s. Furthermore, this distinction between guru and laghu does not seem to be of much importance in the yajur-veda, which has a lot of prose content, though mentioned specifically in the prAtishAkhyam. In any case, I too would appreciate any further information on the use of terms other than guru and laghu in the Chandas-shAstra.
