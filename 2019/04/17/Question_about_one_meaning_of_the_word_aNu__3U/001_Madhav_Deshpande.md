Dear Shri Balasubrahmanian,

  

  I have not consulted works on Chandas Śāstra for the term *aṇūmātrā*. However, this term does occur in the sense of a quarter *mātrā* in Prātiśākhyas, ref. *Taittirīya-Prātiśākhya* (19.3) and *Śaunakīya-Caturādhyāyikā* (3.3.16 in my edition, and 3.65 in Whitney's edition). These texts in Whitney's editions and translations were available to Monier-Williams.
