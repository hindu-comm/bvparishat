namo vidvadbhyaH

  

One of the meanings of the wordaṇuis given as "(in prosody) the fourth part of a mātrā"

in the Monier-Williams dictionary. I find the same meaning given in Apte as well.

  

This definition is not given in the laghu-vRtta-ratnAkaraH. Could someone point me to where this definition might be found?

  

Thank you.

  

Ramakrishnan
