\>One of the meanings of the wordaṇuis given as "(in prosody) the fourth part of a mātrā"

\>in the Monier-Williams dictionary. I find the same meaning given in Apte as well.

  

\>This definition is not given in the laghu-vRtta-ratnAkaraH. Could someone point me to where this definition might be found?

  

  

The word aṇu , for that matter even the word paramāṇu, as related to mātrā is found used in sangīta s'āstra.

  

Books discussing tāl̥a e.g.,[this](https://books.google.co.in/books?id=HVjyfWPCO1wC&pg=PA144&lpg=PA144&dq=guru+laghu+anu+music&source=bl&ots=wYQUv9WOVR&sig=ACfU3U3JC4W_CZsPmRiRVDgQyg2Wr_grCw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiHo8HDnOThAhW44XMBHXEdBco4ChDoATADegQICBAB#v=onepage&q=guru%20laghu%20anu%20music&f=false)discuss this.

  

This book says

  

" mātrā has also been subdivided as aṇu ( 1/2 or 1/4) and paramāṇu (1/4 or 1/8) ̐ithout refereñce to akṣara."
