In technical domains I think meaning of 'fractions' has to be understood by the context, such that there is no verifiable inconsistency in the conclusions. In Lagadha's Arca and Yaajusha Jyotisha, the definition of Rtu is अर्ध-पंचभस्त्वृतुः \|\| This can only mean four-and-half nakshatra segments make one Rtu. With 27 nakshatras and 6 rtus it follows: ( 27/6=4½). The word Rtu is usually associated with the transit of Sun through4½ stars. Lagadha uses the word also for moon's transit through4½ nakshatras.
