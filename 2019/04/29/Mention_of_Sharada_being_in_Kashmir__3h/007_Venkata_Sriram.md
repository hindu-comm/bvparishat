Namaste,

  

Though, both the words सरस्वती, शारदा are पर्यायवाचक, there is slight difference in contemplation.  

  

Mother Sarada of Sringeri is brahmavidyA-pradAyini. The sitting posture, the akSamAla, pustaka, chinmudra, amruta-kalasha in hands resemble the form of Medha Dakshinamurti and hence bestows the brahmavidya that culminates into advaita-siddhi. In Lalita Sahasranama, there is a name as 'दक्षिणामूर्तिरूपिणी' which befits Mother Sarada of Sringeri. A similar vigraha I have seen in the premises of Kamalambika Temple of Thiruvarur. There is a minor temple ofदक्षिणामूर्ति having female form.

  

Mother Saraswathi is laukika-vidyA pradAyini that bestows sangIta & sAhitya kaLAs.

  

rgs,

sriram
