Following is a quick comparison of the depiction of Sarasvatee and Sharada in pictures. (see attached pictures for better understanding). From this comparison, I could not comprehend what ‘dense white clouds' of September/October months have to do with ‘Goddess Sharada'. Even the official publication of Sringeri Mutt – ‘Sri Sharadamba – the Goddess of Grace’ could not help me in this regard.



***Goddess Sarasvatee*** *(based on typical depictions of the goddess in pictures):*

**

1.  Possessions: Veena, Spatika Mala, Book/bundle of palm leaves

2.  

    Saree: Always wearing White colour saree

    

3.  

    Posture: Sitting in the Padma (but not necessarily in Padmasana
    posture)

    

> ***Goddess Sharada*** *(Based on the observations from the largest > and the most active Sharada temple - Sharada Mutt, Sringeri):*

1.  

    Possessions: Crescent moon on the head, Spatika Mala in one hand,
    Book / bundle of palm leaves in one hand, Green Parrot on the hand,
    Amrita Kalasha in one hand, Nose ring, Abhaya hasta, and Veena (on
    Fridays and some special occasions only – in lieu of some of the
    possessions mentioned above)

    

2.  

    Saree: Wearing mostly Red colour saree (occasionally other colors.
    White colour saree only on special occasions like Vasant Panchami,
    Saptami day during Sharad-Navaratri days)

    

3.  

    Posture: Sitting in Padmasana posture (During special occasions
    sitting in the Padma)
