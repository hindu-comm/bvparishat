NamaskaraH,

I have few questions on Shannavathi Shraddha / Tarpanana prayoga.  
Request guidance from the scholars here.

1\. If more than one shannavati shraddha occur on a single day, do we need to do all of them, one after the other? If so, then what is the order in which it is to be performed? eg. Sankramana or Manvadi and amavasya on same day, which should be done first?

3\. If only one of these shraddhas can be performed in a day, then which one do we do sankalpa for?

4\. I have heard that one cannot perform more than one (anna?) shraddha to the same set of pitrus on the same day. Is it so? In such cases what happens if father and mother's shraddha comes on the same day?

Thanks in advance.  
Venkateswaran
