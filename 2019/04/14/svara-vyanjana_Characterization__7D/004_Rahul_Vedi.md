Dear Shri Iyengar and Shri Karve mahodaya

  

I am deeply interested in this topic and have been trying to analyse and isolate the "signature pattern" of various svara and vyanjanas.

I have a feeling that this analysis may help us to understand that sequence arrangements in the Maheshvara sutras and also come to terms with many of the Panini's ashtadhyayi rules.

  

I shall be highly obliged if you can post your sound spectrum pictures and any other material that may be useful in analysing the devanagari svara vyanjana sounds.

  

I have been trying to digitise the basic sounds and then study the various hormonics combinations which identify each sound distinctly.

I am also exploring the possibility of spilting the hormonics into formants using Fourier transforms - a method used for speech and speaker identifications.

  

best regards

Rahul Vedi
