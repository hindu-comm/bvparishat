Dear Shri Iyengar,

  

You have said it. To startwith I too was intrigued by the nature of a consonant in terms of an acoustic signal. When I observed it on a frequency spectrum i I found that the consonant sound is a short sound that measures not more than three to five milliseconds the remaining part is resonance. The signature of each consonant sound is different. Further the number of waves and their pattern for each consonant sound are different. The frequency of the consonant sound is found to be above 1000 cycles and is and is of lower db. If you desire I can send you a scan of the sound spectrum of a consonant.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
