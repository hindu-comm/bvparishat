Namaste

  

On \< analyse and isolate the "signature pattern" of various svara and vyanjanas.>

I do accept the usefulness of such studies. There are more fundamental paradigms that need to be addressed and superimposed on such studies.

  

The question is who leads , drives and benefits from this.

  

The current model is business entrepreneurs push techno- researchers to investigate sacred traditions keeping a bottom line expectation on ROI.

  

The ancient model was Saints-Yogis - Teachers supported to engage with research to bring out wellness- culture- productivity-peace solutions.

  

The pedagogic models and goals are different in both cases. What this means is analysing a human process and phenomenon like Thought to talk
using machines and math models need to be properly placed in the overall map of Shaastra-Vidyas. Mouth -ear model is not

Same as microphone- speaker combine on silicon chip for analysis with a series transform.

  

This is important to know the boundary conditions and constraints in extrapolating machine model analysis to mind model analysis of shaastras.

  

I hope this exchange of ideas will help bridge this gap between humand machine models.
