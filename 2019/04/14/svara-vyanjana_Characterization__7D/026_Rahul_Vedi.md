Dear Dr Yadu

The process of speech analysis may be taken as a two pronged approach.

One aspect is the speech recognition - normally determined by the combination of main frequencies and harmonics.

The other aspect is the speaker recognition. This part is slightly more involved as the same "word" uttered by a child, male or female speaker is identified as different based on the presence of formants composing the speech. Each speaker has a unique combination of the formants.

These may be looked as the "nature" of sound produced by the individual speech articulation anatomy and structure.
