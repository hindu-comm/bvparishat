I don't wish to discourage anyone.

But many of the statements in this thread are not scientific.

Sound spectrum of spoken words has no value in speech.

I won't go into details in this discussion.

I would request to spend a couple of years with Panini

and personal syllable articulation (including breathing and throat control)

in order to appreciate the human biology and sound production.
