I do recommend some studies on the analysis of the Indian theory of speech.

Please study Taittiriya upanisad thoroughly.

Then check modern neuroscience to understand "intentionality" as a concept.

Bhratrhari needs to be studied in parallel.

As I said, we would confuse ourselves more by some free-wheeling

discussion, so let us only discuss privately if deeply interested.
