Dear Professor Iyengar,

  

  You are pointing in the right direction. We should not confuse the conceptions of sounds in Pāṇini, Patañjali and the Śikṣās with modern studies of articulatory and acoustic phonetics. The traditional grammatical conceptions are atomistic in positing discrete sound units, while modern phonetics looks at the continuum of the articulatory process. Even within the tradition, Pāṇini's conception of Samhitā as *paraḥ sannikarṣaḥ saṃhitā* seems to refer to a sequence of discrete sound units, while the Prātiśākhya conception of Saṃhitā as *ekaprāṇayogaḥ saṃhitā* seems to highlight the continuum of the articulatory process. The modern distinctions of allophone versus phoneme are not exactly to be found in the Sanskrit tradition. I would make a distinction between studying the conceptions of Pāṇini or Patañjali from pursuing an independent study of Sanskrit sounds using the technologies available today. Both are productive in their own way, but need not be mixed with each other. I have found this entire discussion very useful to me. With best wishes,
