Dear Scholars

Prof.Deshpande’s post: स्वयं राजन्ते स्वरा: अन्वग् भवति व्यञ्जनम्\| makes me write the following:

Svara intonation (Vedic accents), their origin, variation over millennia will remain a topic of perennial discussion. When this gets mixed not just with science of speech but also with Sanskrit grammar (Shivasutras: svara & vyañjana) the field becomes complex. Further if we bring in music (Sāmavedic) the complexity may become confusion. Let me hasten to add: each individual may have his/her own way of understanding the problem and hence may have clarity. But in social communication, the problem and the tools to explain it coalesce as ‘language’ (Sanskrit or otherwise). We need a super-language or an artifice to pose the question and then discuss the same in terms of the logic of the artifice. IMHO without recognizing that any ‘akṣara’ (laghu, guru included) is a function of *Time* no useful discussion can take place. All human linguistic/ speech/ acoustic effort results in a time signature, to the subject and also to the listener. Explaining this *time signal* by *words* about which there is no common understanding of *meaning* makes one go round and round. Before worrying about how meanings are produced by words composed of akṣaras, it would be worthwhile to standardize and quantify the vyañjana (vargīya and then avargīya). The interesting part is, this cannot be done without first getting signatures of Svaras. Let me explain.

If we record अ first we get a sound wave (not just a harmonic Sine function). This can be converted into equivalent wave form signal by modern techniques. For illustration let अ be as shown (Fig.1)

Now consider कwhich may look like in Fig.2

![image.png](https://groups.google.com/group/bvparishat/attach/7f6393eb02eef/image.png?part=0.2&view=1)

There will be similarities but also marked differences. If we succeed in removing the अ part from Fig.2, we get the स्वरूप of क् This is possible, if only Sanskritists take interest and explore new methods instead of being qualitative, rhetorical and verbose.

Of course there will be many questions, turns and twists that make such research interesting! For example, one may ask whether कि, के will also give same क् ? Theoretically as per Pāṇini it should, except for small errors. I feel all व्यञ्जन can be represented quite accurately in terms of their frequency spectrum instead of time signal. I cannot go into details here. क् cannot be heard independently but can be felt subjectively and seen by allobjectively as a spectrum.

The Svaras अ इ उwill have a dominant frequency and higher harmonics in their spectrum and this will be different for different individuals. What may be universal (just a guess) is the relative ratio of peak frequencies across a group of subjects. Only after settling this one can discuss meaningfully Vedic accents, Mantra, Sāma-gāna, transiting to classical music. For some unambiguous definition of Śruti and Svara populalry translated as pitch and tone see <https://www.academia.edu/35405548/Concept_of_Probability_in_Sanskrit_Texts_on_Classical_Music>
