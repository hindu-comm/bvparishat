Dr Yadu,

I think the scope of the discussion of Dr. Mishra is different from the limited scope of what we are saying. Time domain, frequency domain, and Phonemes are modern concepts and are all very useful tools of analysis. No one can deny that.

The Indian theory of speech and reference to ancient texts is looking at a higher level concept, say, like "Natural Language Processing (NLP)". I think that this discussion thread is looking at the speech/sound at a lower level. Swar/vyanjan by themselves do not carry any meaning/intention. I hope that there is no disagreement on that.
