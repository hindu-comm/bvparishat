Namaste Dr Mishra

  

I am totally baffled by your response, which does not answer the basic "UTILITY ASPECT" for a spectra-graph as a technique for differentiating.

  

Example: If the same "WORDS" a uttered by a Child, Women or a man in the same room. A listener can certainly identify the three different sound origination. So if one records a Sound Spectrum of they THREE Voices they will be different.  

  

This example was illustrate by Dr. Narayn Joshi in the "Spota-Doctrine" paper published by BORI. I am sure he would be a better person to elaborate and clarift this issue.  

  

I have difficulty is accepting your statement of "NO USE" for a tool.  

  

How can scientist disregard a Methodology or a Tool is beyond my comprehension.

  

Thx

  

Dr Yadu

Speech is syllable based, and produced through a neural translation.

Speech has an intent involved in transforming the neural energy to acoustics.

So each syllable is created. Words are learned and operate through behavior.

The latter creates its own breathing and tone as learned externally.
