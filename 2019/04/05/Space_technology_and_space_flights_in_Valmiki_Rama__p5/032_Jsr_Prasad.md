Respected speaker highlighted the importance of separating similes to derive an intuition in Ramayana. Here it is the space science that he has taken as an example. A person like me could see concepts of Ayurveda. It may be something else for other scholars. Keeping aside the corroborating facts with regard to interpretations, the effort must be laudable. Because, Sanskritists are not trained in sciences (not all)and scientists are ignorant of Sanskrit (not all). A very few like Gopalakrishnan ji delve deep into such interpretations. We need more of such thinking. It becomes an issue only when we claim, we know everything in the past. It is obvious that needs of those days were totally different, accordingly they developed respective science and technologies, not more, not less.

  

Comparison of Simhika with one of the 'vile vortices' seemed interesting. You need to come out from the realm of language for such comparisons. Otherwise, scientists like Sri Satish Chandra of Bangalore, would not have spent considerable amount of time on Purusha-sukta to derive insights of electrical engineering thus finally producing a generator that functions on cosmic energies only.

  

My suggestion to scholars -

We need to make sure whether we interpret saastra using modern scientific method (which may include carbon dating, archaeological evidences, artefacts, fossils etc.) or aapta-pramana.

  

It is to be noted here that, Just because something is not explicit in the ancient Indian writings, doesn't mean, it is absent altogether. If so, one can debate to an extent that Patanjali was not aware of any aasanas (Ref: स्थिरसुखमासनम् ।).
