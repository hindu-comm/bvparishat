As I know, alata chakra is due to a single cane staff, about 5.6 inches to 6 feet in length and held in the hand of a person. Cloth dipped in oil is firmly tied at both ends and theyare lighted. With those flaming torches, the persons whirls in good speed and the fire brands look as though they describe a circle. Many people hold sticks in both hands and whirl them simultaneously. I have seen such tatoo shows performed by the armed forces. (In my younger days I too used to wield a single stick). My teachers explained the word alata to mean thecircle described by the two tips of staff held in the hand of a person.

Mind, as we know, is also compared to a wheel. etan-mano-mayam chakram brahmanaa nirmitam puraa, and the place where the nemi (rim of the wheel) stopsis called naimisham. alata-shanti is the cessation of the chitta-vrittis, otherwise called mano-naasa by Vidyaranya.

Namaskars,

Aravinda Rao
