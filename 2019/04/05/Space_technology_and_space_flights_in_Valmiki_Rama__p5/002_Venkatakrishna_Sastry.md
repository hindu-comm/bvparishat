Namaste

  

The lecture topic and perspective opens another front for discussion.

  

It is not enough to say ‘ a great technology existed and it is lost to us now! And feel pride and lament on the loss. This is Irrespective of time scale (positioning valmikis work in a different yuga by several millennia . or. A few thousand years behind us ( date of ramayana: 6000 BCE ?? With great concessions to Hindu sentiments?? )

  

When and why was it lost ? The answer like pralaya does not satisfy here!

  

What still connects our time through valmiki to vedas ( and of course through dashaavataara to Mahavihnu) - is the language called Samskrutham and its practical called Yoga ( by Patanjali / yogopanishads and the like).

  

Any construction of existing text of Ramayana needs to have a balance on history, linguistics, faith- belief, philosophy and mystic science.

  

My question is, thetefore: have looked at vijnana of Yoga- Vedanta, beyond faithful repetition of veda-mantra: vedanta- vijnana- sunischitaarthaah??

  

Look for scholars help to understand better the constructions presented in lecture.
