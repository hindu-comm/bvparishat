The beautiful s'loka quoted by the speaker in the seventh slide as किष्किंधा कांड 46-15 , I found in my Gita Press copy as

  

आदर्शतलसंकाशा ततो वै पृथिवी मया ।

आलातचक्रप्रतिमा दृष्टा गोष्पदवत् तदा ॥ 46-13

  

For the benefit of the younger members, I wanted to show a video of आलातचक्र, but I could not locate. Other members, if you can locate please share. Dear young friends, it is a ring of metal that has flames placed at different points of it, usually equidistant and held from the centre of the ring through usually a non-conducting support and rotated at a great speed. Because of the great speed, different flames appear to be a single line of fire. This upamaana, simile is a frequent appearance in ancient Sanskrit and other Indian literature. Here, Maharshi Valmiki is making Sugriva describe the Earth from the perception of a fast moving onlooker of the Earth. The details of the Earth that can be seen from the close, while moving slowly , are getting blurred into a glass like look because of the fast movement of the onlooker. आलातचक्र is
brought as a simile to such a sight of the Earth. Size of the Earth feels like getting reduced for a fast moving onlooker, doesn't it? गोष्पद , foot of a cow is brought as a simile to that feel.

  

Do such apt and beautiful descriptions which we the modern humans find to match with our contemporary experiences thanks to the contemporary technology come to the minds of poets like Valmiki out of their great imagination or out of their experience through some technological means ? The speaker seems to think that the latter is the case.
