\> We come across this "Alaata-chakra" frequently in ancient literature,  
\> including MB. What kind of object is it? Does it refer to a particular type  
\> of meteor that burns and swirls to eventually either vanish or fall on  
\> ground to create an impact crater?  
  
  

al훮ta (or 훮l훮ta) means "firebrand" or "torch". al훮tacakra is the  
"circle" (cakra) which becomes visible by twirling a torch. It is used  
as an example of the appearance of an illusion (there is no such  
"circle" in reality, it is just an optical illusion or a trick of the  
senses).
