The most familiar example of alata (chakra) is the 'sur-sur bathi' (in Kannada) and 'kambi mathaappu' in Tamil. When this is ignited and held in hand and whirled, which all of us have done during Dipavali, the effect of circular motion and the ignited chakra happens. Sometimes the rope-mathaappu is also whirled and the ignited circular effect is had.
