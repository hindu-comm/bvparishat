This topic was discussed to some extent long back in BVP.

We come across this "Alaata-chakra" frequently in ancient literature, including MB. What kind of object is it? Does it refer to a particular type of meteor that burns and swirls to eventually either vanish or fall on ground to create an impact crater?

Atharvaveda tradition talks about 'Alaata-shanti-upanishad'. Dear Sri Subrahmanian is their any information on this Upanishad.

  

Thanks
