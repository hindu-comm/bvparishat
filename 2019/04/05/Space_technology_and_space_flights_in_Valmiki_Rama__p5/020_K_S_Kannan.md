A fast rotating rod or even a wire with flame at just one end can create that illusion.

  

This is a simple issue of what is called in physics "the persistence of vision" -

over a dozen images in quick succession give a feeling of continuity,

the essential principle behind all animation.

Alternations in direction within incandescent bulbs, just not grasped by our eyes,

is also a kindred phenomenon, I guess.
