I have supplied multiple times on this very platform (= *punarukti* !)

the smart Sanskrit verse which lists **eight** occasions that warrant *punarukti*

(immaterial of the language):

  

***tadarthAtis'aye s'aighrye***

*** dainye kope'vadhAraNe \|***

***vis"Ade vismaye hars"e***

*** punaruktam na dus"yati ! \|\|***

***  
***

**My teacher used to say :**

To repeat and revise, and revise and repeat

is the good mark of a good teacher !

  

**A standard tip for public speakers:**

**Say** what you are going to say,

**say** it, and  

**say** what you have said!

  

(May I suppose nobody will force me to do the *punarukti* of the above  

(on this very list at least) again and again!?)
