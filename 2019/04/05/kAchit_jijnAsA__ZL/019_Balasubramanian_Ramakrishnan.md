Thank you, Mahamohopadyaya Korada Subrahmanyam-ji. As usual, there is a lot of interesting information from your reply. I have a question. In Tamil grammar, there is something called iraTTai-kiLavi, where two words are repeated and there are certain situations which warrant such punarukti. For example, from fear you may say tI, tI (fire, fire). Is there something in Sanskrit grammar which allows such punarukti?
