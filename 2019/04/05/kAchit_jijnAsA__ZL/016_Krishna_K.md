Punarukti is a flaw because it is ज्ञात-ज्ञापक (conveys what is already known). While that is not a logical flaw, it is a linguistic flaw. The purpose of language is to conduce an another (para-pravrittyartham - according to mimamsaka), and unnecessary communication to that effect is a flaw. Punarukti is considered a flaw

even in other languages' usage. Phrases such as 'repeat again', 'reply back', 'comprise of' are cases of Redundancy of speech.

  

On the other hand, repetition (अभ्यास) is a useful tool to emphasize (आदरार्थ / अवधारणार्थ), and is therefore indicative of purport (तात्पर्य लिङ्ग). Shri Vyasaraja delineates the following situations, \*in shaastra\*, that distinguish abhyaasa from punarukti -

1\. if the expression is in the form of a vow or pledge

2\. if the repetition is done to conclude the topic under consideration, after discussing another topic related and useful to the current topic.

3\. if there is some additional purport

Krishna
