Sincere **thanks**,Shri.Siddharth Wakankar,Shri. Subrahmanian,Shri.Nagaraj Paturi,Shri.S.L.Abhyankar ,Shri.Venkatesh Murthy for the information & clarification.

From well explained different premises by you, i can make logical argument (understanding in my words) for myself is that ,

1) Punarukti is a dosha when it is unwarranted . For example, in s'aastra, is all about precision and abstraction from the vast subject matter to a concise and brief systematic understanding.(Best explained above by Shri. Subrahmanian & Shri.Nagaraj Paturi Sir)  

2) Punarukti is not a defect when the context demand.For example, the commentary of Adi Shankaracharya for the Bh.gita verse 2.24: ( Best explained by Shri.S.L.Abhyankar)

  

Thanks with regards.
