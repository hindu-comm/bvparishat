Dear Sri Amod-ji,

  

Punarukti is considered to be dosha in loka, s'aastra and kaavya for different reasons.

  

1\. In loka, did you not notice people saying 'yeh to tum kah chuke ho, fir kyon dohraa rahe ho? kuch nayaa bolo'. 'It is boring to hear repetition' is the idea here. But it is not strictly prohibited, it is tolerated in loka, unlike in s'aastra and kaavya.

  

2\. In kaavya, the reason of 'boring' as in loka does exist. Apart from that , in kaavya punarukti is against the principle of utmost possible brevity, utmost possible economy of words.

  

3\. In s'aastra too , the same principle of utmost possible brevity, utmost possible economy of words is followed and that is the reason punarukti is treated as dosha.

  

For the principle of utmost possible brevity, utmost possible economy of words, in kaavya the reason is minmal use of vaachya , leaving most of the intended communication to vyangya or dhvani.

  

For the principle of utmost possible brevity, utmost possible economy of words, in s'aastra , the reason is precision of expression, since s'aastra is all about precision and abstraction from the vast subject matter to a concise and brief systematic understanding.
