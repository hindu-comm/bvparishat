Dear all

  

this is found in wikipedia

"The learning of the Vedas begins in the month of[Shraavana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shraavana "Shraavana")with a Upakarma and is temporarily terminated in[Magha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magha_(month) "Magha (month)")with an Utsarjana ritual, to be restarted in the next[Shravan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shravan "Shravan"). However, it was found that six months in a year results in a very long period to complete the study of Vedas. In order to overcome this difficulty, Brahmins started skipping the Utsajana ritual and studied Vedas through all the months of the year."  

  

is it acceptable to sampradaya? if yes

from what time utsarjana and upakarma came to be observed together?

it is difficult to find answers in grhyasutras.

please enlighten me if there are any material or sampradaya.
