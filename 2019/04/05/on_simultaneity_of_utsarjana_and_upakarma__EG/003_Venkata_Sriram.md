Namaste,

  

Even the upAkarma is skipped by many traditional families of Andhra & Telangana. For many in Andhra & Telangana, it is only a ritual of changing the yajnopaveeta. I was surprised to learn that many even doesn't know the procedure of 'kAmOkArsheet japam' and 'tarpaNam'. The next day, one must perform 'sahasra-gayatri' japa and homa.

  

With 'upAkarma', the veda-adhyayana starts for 6 months and with 'utsarjana', the study of mantra-bhAga is stopped and the shAstra-adhyayana (veda-bhASya, chandas, nirukta etc.) commences for 6 months. Now, hardly, people are following these even in traditional gurukulams.

  

rgs,

sriram
