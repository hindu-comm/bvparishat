Namaste.  
In my understanding, shrAvaNa to mAgha period is well suited for activities with finite scope in time and space, while mAgha to shrAvaNa is for activities with an "infinite scope" in time and space.  
This is also the reason behind Bhishma having to wait for mAgha's arrival. It is another thing that winter solstice (=/= uttarayana) also used to coincide around the start of mAgha in that epoch (because of yuga transition).
