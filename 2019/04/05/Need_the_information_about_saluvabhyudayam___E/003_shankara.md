Namaste,

  

It seems Saluvabhyudaya has not yet been edited and published. You may have to access it from manuscript libraires. \[I don't have access to latest volumes (listing Sanskrit works beginning with S) of New Catalogus Catalogorum. So, I could not confirm whether Saluvabhyudaya has been published during the last few years\].  

  

S. Krishnaswami Ayyangar has included some extracts from Saluvabhyudaya in his 'Sources of Vijayanagara History', page 30. There is also a chapter-wise summary of the kavya from page 90 onwards.
