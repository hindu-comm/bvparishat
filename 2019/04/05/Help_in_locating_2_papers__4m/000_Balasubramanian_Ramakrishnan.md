I am looking to get 2 papers of Prof. Cardona:

  

1\. "The bhasika accentuation system,"Studien zur Indologie und Iranistik 18: 1-40

2\. "The Bhasika Accent Revisited," Adyar Library Bulletin, pp. 159-174, v78-79,2014-2015

  

I know these are copyrighted, but it would be great if you have a soft copy that you are willing to share with me privately.

  

Thanks!

  

Ramakrishnan
