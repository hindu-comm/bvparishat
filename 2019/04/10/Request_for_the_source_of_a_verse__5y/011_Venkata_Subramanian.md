Thank you very much Sri. Jsr Prasad for the reply and enligtening the internal and external types of Samputikarana Shlokaṣ.

Even in Durga Sapthashathi or Devi Mahathmyam samputikarana shlokas are mentioned both internal and external typeṣ

So in this case of Valmiki Ramayanam .Presumably those conversant with mantrashastra might have incorporated the samputikarana shlokas to increase the efficacy.

Since I am not conversant with Mantrashastra, I am unable to say why samputikarana shlokas are needed or noṭ

But in practice I have observed that samputikarana shlokas are reciteḍ

In the present case I am unable to locate a particular shloka prescribed for samputikarana and also Japaṃ

The informattion regarding the source of the shloka will be appreciated .
