This verse is prescribed one in the edition of Valmiki Ramayana of Gita Press Gorakhpur for Balaknda to be recited before and after every verse.

This is also mentioned for Japan for Sundara Kandam in Sri Rama Bhakti Kalpalathika- an old edition from Kumbakonam.

I wish to know it's source as I am unable to find out either in Valmki Ramayana or Agastya Samhita or RamaTapani Upanishad.

Hence the request
