There are many museums in India which have Manuscripts,but,except some hand list or a rough catalogue or listing,hardly any efforts are made to either work.on them or to bring out their catalogues.

  

Rampur Raza Library brought out a catalogue of their Illustrated Urdu and Persian MSS.

  

I am given to understand that the Bhavani Chitrasangrahalay of the erstwhile Aundh State in the Satara District of Maharashtra has brought out or digitised( I am not much sure) their mss.very recently.

  

You have to verify it from some knowledgeable sources

  

Best luck in your hunt.
