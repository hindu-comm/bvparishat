The Varaha Grhyasutra opens with an enumeration of several Parishishtas, some of which have been printed. In addition to the ones at the link below, we have Bhutotpatti (Grhyapurusha) and a couple of others. See<http://vedicreserve.mum.edu/kalpa/grihya/varaha_grihya_sutram.pdf>

  

They cover Shrauta-Grhya and other areas of Kalpa even though they are enumerated at the beginning of the Kalpasutra. As you can see, Gonamika etc., are also enumerated. The Prince of Wales Museum at Mumbai has a manuscript containing all these Parishishtas.

  

Somewhere, I read that the Maitrayani Pratisakhya is also included in the Parishishtas, but obviously this list of 22 Parishishtas does not seem to include it, at a glance.

  

Let alone the Maitrayaniyas, even the Shukla Yajurveda Katyayana Parishishtas are not printed in entirety (for example, the longish and important Naigama Parishishta). Shri Pandit Anna Shastri Ware had published 10 of them from Nashik in a single volume in 1930s (a copy of which was made available to me with great difficulty by a late relative who had people search several libraries in India about 15 years ago) and a few others were published by Shri T N Dharmadhikari etc.
