Here is the specific passage from Vishnu Bhataji Godse's माझा प्रवास (reprint edition in 1974, Venus Prakashan, Pune, pp. 30-31; in my English translation): "In the city of Gwalior, the Upanayana of the son of a well known person occurred in the month of Āṣāḍha. There was a meeting regarding this in the Vitthal temple and on that occasion many scholars such as Rāmācārya had come. The Upanayana was done following the opinion of a pandit named Tātu Dīkṣita Bhaḍkamkar, who was a famous Veda reciter who could recite the R̥gveda upto ghanapāṭha. Mr. Bhaḍkamkar established that it is justified to perform the Upanayana of a Brahmin in the month of Āṣāḍha until Viṣṇuśayana based on references from Smr̥tis, Sūtras and the Maitrāyaṇīya Pariśīṣṭa, and the Pañcagauḍa brahmins from Mathurā testified at this meeting that it is a tradition among the Pañcagauḍa brahmins to perform the Upanayana in the month of Āṣāḍha. Pandit Bhaḍkamkar performed the Upanayana in the month of Āṣāḍha, and the meeting concluded that this was done according to the Śāstras." This account describes the visit of Vishnu Bhataji Godse to north India in 1857.
