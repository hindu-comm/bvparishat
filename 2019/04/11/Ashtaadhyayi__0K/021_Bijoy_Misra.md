What we (I) think that there is a difference between thought and expression.

The thought is cosmic (externally induced, involuntary). This is just a model,

we have not defined what "cosmic" may mean in this context.

But the expression is physical (created, voluntary). The thought is analog and  

the expression is segmented. The segmentation happens because of numerous  

time scales involved in neural circuitry and in breathing.  

  

Our first two papers are coming out through the WSC XVI (2015) Conf volume  

later this month. They would be publicly available and can be publicly reviewed.

  

In the third paper we go into the information mapping through pitch which

has broader significance on information theory and the theory of communication.

Information mapping has built in information loss, we have to come to grips

with us statistically. Now we are developing the mathematics for the problem.  

  

I would suggest that you conduct classes in the Science Faculty on the  

practice of syllable recitation. It can only be experimented and appreciated  

by individual work. One must watch the brain as we recite. It might take

several years. Holding breath (move air) is not easy. Vocal musicians  

might do, but they may not care for the body processes. Please try various

ways to get people interested in the science of speech.
