Dear Deshpandeji,

  

Why didn't anybody prior to Bhattoji Dixit feel the need to make the statement

  

हकारादिषु अकार उच्चारणार्थ.  

  

Does it mean grammarians prior to Bhattoji Dixit could pronounce consonants without suffixing vowels to them.

  

Out of inquisitiveness I would like to ask scholars whether while uttering ककार or for that matter any other consonant do we suffix अ to the consonant.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
