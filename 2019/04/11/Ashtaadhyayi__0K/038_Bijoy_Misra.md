We don't have to go in public discussion on this.

I will write Monday.

  

Meanwhile check what instructions you might share with the anatomist on Panini on degrees of freedom

(this is the key). Studying some anatomy books either Indian or western might help (I have not done).

Follow Panini and other pratisakhya literature to design the experiment (give it time).

if you have already done, please send me the paper. Some other literature on degrees of freedom may exist

(please look). Do it on yourself first with a tape recorder(recording device) to check the uniqueness of the sounds.

Be thoroughly scientific.
