Anatomy books will not help us much in this case. In simplest terms, anatomy subject is totell 'which part is where in the body' (just locating the body parts). What we need for our discussion is 'how the body parts function' (both individually and in collaboration). This subject is called 'Physiology'. One needs to understand the physiology of many organs right from head, neck, chest and down to diaphragm.A Speech Therapist (Speech-Language Pathologist) is the person that can help with this.

  

CG Krishnamurthi ji has shared links tofew steps taken in this direction. But unfortunatelythesesteps are not sufficient enoughto design experiments to prove or disprove how scientific Panini (Ashtadhyayi or Shiksha) and Pratisakhyas.
