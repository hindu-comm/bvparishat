I harbor a thought that there were pre-Panini experiments on human expression

to create an independent set of sounds. I use the word "independence"

as in mathematical language, I can't verify the physicality.

You or Prof Prasad who have access to well-trained voices may help do

a biology experiment to check the sound quality in Paninian system.

I will provide the software to record the acoustic signature.

  

In this system of thinking I consider Panini as an anatomist first. I think

there was substantial work on human anatomy and hence it would not  

surprise me if they also created a basic set of human signature.

Such set was then mapped to the Vedic and the local languages to find

patterns. Compounding, suffixes and other parts of grammar developed through

iterations over centuries (as Panini acknowledges)

  

Maheswara could be the name of the scientist who conducted the early

biology experiment and discovered the basic set.

  

The above is a working hypothesis for our group. There are a lot of

ramifications which I can't elaborate through this mail.
