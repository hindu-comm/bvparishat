To put the question the other way what is the opinion of scholars on whether the Ashtaadhyayi was composed s-swar or monotone? Criticizing the views or the efforts of those who attempted to render it s-swar does not solve the problem.

  

When Deshpandeji pens down his Krishna verses do they occur s-swar in his mind or they occur monotone?

  

Must Panini have composed the Ashtadhyayi s-swar or monotone?

  

Achyut Karve.
