Dear Achyut Ji,

  

  Before answering your question, it would be useful to know if you have read any works on Sanskrit grammar including and beginning with Patañjali's Mahābhāṣya and coming down to grammarians like Nāgeśabhaṭṭa. That way people responding to you can refer to works you may have read before. I quoted Bhaṭṭoji's SK since it is perhaps the most widely studied work these days. But these discussions go back to Kātyāyana and Patañjali. The question is have you read any of their works before raising some of your questions? If you have not, please read Kātyāyana's Vārtikas and Patañjali's Mahābhāṣya on the Śivasūtras.
That should resolve mostof your questions. You can conveniently find MM Vasudeva Shastri Abhyankar's Marathi translation of the entire Mahābhāṣya in a library like the Bhandarkar Institute.
