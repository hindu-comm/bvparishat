Dear Deshpandeji,

  

I have the Marathi translation of Mahabhashya byMM Vasudeva Shastri Abhyankar. I have gone through the first two Anhiks a number of times, however I never noticed any statement to the effect that a consonant cannot be phonated without a suffixed vowel.If I have missed it kindly bring it to my notice.In fact Patanjali does not deal with the झल letters in the first two anhiks.

  

My interactions with this forum are with the aim to ensure that I do not go wrong. My doubts regarding the way the alphabet is phonated are genuine. I have with the help of the Maheshwar Sutras corrected my articulation over a span of 12 to 15 years which was necessary for the study of the Tabla. I had the good fortune of observing and studying great artists like Ahmedjan Thirakwa and Pandit Gajananrao Joshi live.
This study has surely sharpened my senses on account of which I have no alternative but to raise doubts even if it be regarding Panini himself.


  

Here is the next doubt regarding the Maheshwar Sutras itself.

  

According to Shiksha ल is दंतव्य and ण is मूर्धन्य. How can one phonate मूर्धन्य ण after दंतव्य ल. It is necessary that ल has to be मूर्धन्य if ण has to be मूर्धन्य.

  

If still one argues that ल is दंतव्य how can लbe the सवर्ण of र given the Sutra तुलस्य प्रयत्नं सवर्णम् where र is मूर्धन्य.

  

When can a thing be equated with another or when can one thing be replaced by another? Only when there is at least one common characteristic in the two other than they being merely things. We cannot equate the weight of a thing with the volume of another thing.
Similarly is it not necessary to define the commonality between र and ल before making them fit to replace one another. Forwarding the case that they are visible in social discourse and the tradition is an excuse.

  

The realm of letters (अक्षर) is much beyond Sanskrit. The letters occurring in the Maheshwar Sutras are universal. They have no equivalents. It would not be wrong to say that the Ashtadhyayi would not have seen the light of the day had it not been for the Maheshwar Sutras. It is therefore important that the Maheshwar Sutras be dealt in still greater detail to make the Ashtadhyayi meaningful. I doubt whether the aesthetic of the Ashtadhyayi and the greatness of Panini can ever be appreciated with the help of logic.

  

I would be grateful to receive help. However if the esteemed members of this list feel that I am indulging in polemics be it as it may. I will then as I have done for the past one year disassociate myself from the discussions on the group.  

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
