Dear Radhakrishna Ji and Shripad Ji,

  

  Both of you have brought up something interesting. All vowels are in the terminology of the Prātiśākhyas *aspr̥ṣṭa* or *vivr̥ta*sounds, that means the oral track remains open without any *sprarśa*. Among consonants, the Sanskrit terminology itself distinguishes between *sprarśa* consonants, namely the five *vargas* beginning with *k, c, ṭ, t*and *p*, versus other consonants. Among them the semi-vowels are treated as *īṣat-spr̥ṣṭa,* while the sibilants are treated as *īṣad-vivr̥ta*, *vivr̥ta* or *aspr̥ṣṭa*depending on which Prātiśākhya or Śikṣā one looks at. What this shows is that the *sparśa* consonants (except nasals, where the nasal track has *vivaraṇa* "opening" according to Prātiśākhyas) involve a stopping of the flow of the air by the contact between the articulator (*karaṇa*) and the place or articulation. After the contact comes the release of the contact before the pronunciation of the next sound. The *sparśa* consonants would be inaudible if they just ended in the contact. On the other hand, the semi-vowels and sibilants have a continuant quality because of partial contact or openness. Even with this difference, no single consonants appear as words, unlike a few single vowels. Syllables in Sanskrit can be V, CV, CVC or VC, but a consonant C by itself does not form a syllable, according to the rules of syllabication given in the Prātiśākhyas. These are discussed in great detail by Siddheshwar Varma in his classic book:*Critical Studies in the Phonetic Observations of Indian Grammarians.*
