Dear Achyut Ji,

  

  If you consult a commentary like the Siddhānta-Kaumudī of Bhaṭṭoji Dīkṣita, you will see a clear statement: हकारादिषु अकार उच्चारणार्थ: ।
The vowel 'a' in the Śivasūtras beginning with हयवरट् is only to facilitate the pronunciation of consonants and not part of the listed sounds, except in the Śivasūtra लण् (लण्मध्ये त्वित्संज्ञक:). This last statement itself is contested among the commentators and not universally accepted.
