Vak in this sense is our intent and not what is finally expressed.

Words are limited. Acoustic limitation could be in our hearing (Bhratrhari)  

A statement could be broadly true, but we have to make sense

physically. This last thought is my thinking on many of the utterances

by various philosophers. We don't interpret literally, but have to do conceptually.
