Dear Deshpandeji,

  

Below find attached the pdf of the relavent page.

  

The first point is that the discussion in the Mahabhashya highlighted by you pertains to the question of whether a vowel is accented or a consonant, it is not regarding whether a consonant can be independently voiced or not. From the quote therefore it appears that you have inferred that a consonant cannot be voiced independently. So the quote in no way addresses the question raised by me. Patanjali has not discussed the झल letters independently in the second anhik. Why he has not dealt with them in the second anhik is a subject that needs to be answered with in the framework of the Mahabhashya.

  

The sentence marked at '1' (see attached pdf) says that consonants cannot be **clearly** voiced (independently). It does not say that consonants cannot be voiced independently. The sentence marked at '2' states that looking to the etymology of the **word consonant** it conveys that a consonant illumines with the help of a vowel. Again it does not mean that it cannot be phonated independently.

  

What does the above sentence 'it illumines with the help of a vowel,' mean? What I derive is that the characteristic feature of a consonant is to colour the vowel. How it colours the vowel has been dealt with by Patanjali in the 2nd anhik under the topic of 18 अण's by giving examples like किरिणी and गिरिणी.

  

From the above it is obvious that a consonant is a separate thing a substance used to colour something which is colourless. And therefore by themselves vowels are of no use in making a language. We cannot have a language which only consists of vowels as that would be no different than the calls of animals and birds.

  

Coming to the point whether a consonant can be independently voiced or not we need to reflect on what Abhayankarji has said. But yet one may argue that a consonant is voiced by either suffixing it to a vowel or prefixing it to one.

  

So how do we go about deciding whether a consonant can be individually voiced. What difference will it make? Thus we first need to ask ourselves the question what is the benefit by assuming that it cannot be voiced independently? And secondly by asking ourselves the question what is the benefit by assuming that it can be voiced independently?
The onus of answering the first question lies with you. Here is the answer to the second question.

  

If a consonant can be voiced independently it is possible to make oneself aware of the difference between voicing a vowel and a consonant. This makes the shiksha meaningful.

  

If a consonant can be voiced independently one can define the extra effort that one needs to put in to voice a consonant with a suffixed or prefixed vowel.

  

If a consonant can be voiced independently it allows us to peep into how man must have used his vocal apparatus to evolve a language.

  

Had there been no specific effort in voicing consonants independently possibly we would not have witnessed the uniformity that we see in the table of touch (plosive) consonants. This uniformity in the plosive consonants and their use is only visible in Sanskrit.

  

If consonants cannot be independently voiced how can one determine Savarna that is the nearness of one consonant to another.

  

If consonants were not independently visualized then why the need to stateनाज्झलौ.

  

They can be independently visualized only because they can be independently voiced.

  

The question now to be answered is how can we voice a consonant independently?

  

Each of the plosive (vargiya) consonants can be voiced without attaching vowels by pressing the tongue at the right (appropriate) place and blowing air to release the tongue.

  

One will now say that this is not enough because this kind of voicing consonants is of no use for a language.

  

The solution to this problem is the recitation of the Maheshwar Sutras ( refer to my youtube video

<https://youtu.be/yGy7f4WhKjU> )  

where all the consonants have been voiced one after the other without suffixing vowels.

  

What is the articulatory difference when a consonant is voiced without a suffixed vowel and when it is voiced with a suffixed vowel?

  

When a consonant is voiced without a suffixed vowel the tongue remains lifted after the consonant is voiced. However when it is voiced with a suffixed vowel the tongue takes the position of the ensuing vowel on the floor of the mouth. (The tongue is not lifted while voicing vowels.)

  

It is therefore obvious that the letters in the Maheshwar Sutras are not those that can be directly used in words. They are indicators specifying the effort needed and the place to voice each letter independently. It is for this reason that Patanjali says that each of the letters in the Maheshwar Sutras represent a class. The process through which these letters need to go to make words is the subject matter of the Ashtaadhyayi. It is similar to assembling the parts (here aksharas) of a thing so that it can do its assigned work. 

  

Finally say if an individual or a group cannot voice consonants independently does it necessarily mean that they cannot be voiced independently?

  

Thank you for allowing me to voice my views on the subject

  

With regards

Achyut Karve
