Namaste



***Question*** , picking a very narrow segment of this discussion, ( and pardon me for needle picking the issue, which is intriguing):



***Reference***: 



 \< Prof. Deshpande: Single consonants occurring at the end of a syllable **can be pronounced**, but not a lone consonant standing by itself. That is I think what Patañjali is saying.>

 \< Prof. Abhyankar : सर्वे प्रत्याहाराः अपि हलन्ताः - **न किमपि काठिन्यं तेषामुच्चारणे** (!) \>



***Question***: What is the key issue to focus regarding the ' Single Consonant' ( vargeeya Vyanjana; to keep away the antastha and osshma which have ingrained inheritance of svara in them )

 :: ac -swara -rahitaanaam -swatantra- uccharanm?





 Is it on ' Difficulty ( kaathinyam) in Articulate pronunciation ( uccharana) ? which means the attention is on neural functioning, (vak-indriya karma, Vaikhari )

**This is pointed on sthana-prayatna viveka**.

OR



Is it on ' impossibility ( ashakyataa) in Articulate pronunciation ( uccharana) ? which means the speech mechanism
(vak-indriya karma, Vaikhari -Sthana- Prayatna) is NOT designed by Nature (= prakruti) to do so, even though

' Manas/ Buddhi ( = Mind) can conceptualize and ' see- sense' the 'half consonant, stripped of the ending svara; as a intermediary entity in forming Conjuncts and Combines (Gunita and Sandhyakasharas)' which can be articulated

later ? 

 **This is pointed on Conceptualization ( bhaavanaa) - Internal Cognition ( antar-darshanaa) - Thought transitions to talk ( aakhyaana ) of Vak- Vrutti - Jijnyaasaa; and gets connection to Background process of Vaikhari, **

**explained by Panini maharshi (JSR Prasad).**

****

** The pronunciation of vargeeya vyanjanas with visarga and anuswaara is a sub set issue here; depending upon how one wants to position anuswara- visarga in the 'swara-set'! Which can become more complicated if the **

**vaidika swara issues and ' hinkara -saama veda issues' are to be brought in . **

****

** Will** **कः be two \<** **क् - अं \> or three units
\<** **क् -** **अ - ः \> ? What is the ' perception- articulation on part here : Swatantra** **क् or Yukta or unarticualted yet conceived in the flow as process ( alaukika) ? **

****

** ( What applies to is also true for** **ॐ - गं - गम् - the Ganesha beeja-akshara !) **

****

**Pl. clarify.**

Dear Abhyankar Ji,



  Single consonants occurring at the end of a syllable can be pronounced, but not a lone consonant standing by itself. That is I think what Patañjali is saying.
