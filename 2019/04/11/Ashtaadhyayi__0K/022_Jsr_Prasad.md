Happy to note that you attributed something 'super-natural' to the origin of a thought.

  

But, thought and expression are different when you say, I think, traditional view may not subscribe it. Some vacuum needs to cleared there. Because, 'यन्मनसा ध्यायति तद्वाचा वदति, यद्वाचा वदति तत्कर्मणा करोति, यत्कर्मणा करोति तदभिसम्पद्यते' (could not recall source).

  

We look forward to your forthcoming 2 papers and the 3rd one is equally interesting. Your suggestion to have class in science faculty makes sense. It is a good idea.

  

AntahkaraNam has four different functioning with various other terms attributed, in Ayurveda/Upanishads.
