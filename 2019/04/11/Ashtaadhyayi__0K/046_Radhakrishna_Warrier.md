Yes, that is absolutely true, Prof. Deshpande-ji. A consonant cannot be pronounced if there is no vowel before or after it. For example, we can pronounce "ek" or "ke" but cannot pronounce the pure consonant "k" (क्).


  

I suspect nasals (anunāsika) which are also categorized as vyañjana (consonants) might be the exceptions to this rule. I think we can pronounce "mmmmmm" or "nnnnnnnnn" without any vowels before or after these sounds. So are /s/, /ś/, /r/ etc. Perhaps we are not pronouncing the true consonant but unknowingly prefixing or suffixing a very short schwa when trying to pronounce the pure consonant /m/, /n/, /s/, /r/ etc.
