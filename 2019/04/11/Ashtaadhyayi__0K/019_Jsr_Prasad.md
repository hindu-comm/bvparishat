With apologies to Sri Achyut ji, for intruding into his thread that may not require following discussion.

  

Thanks Prof. Bijoy ji.

You mentioned about how an analog signal is created. Does a neuroscientist be aware of 'the' omniscient-omnipotent-omnipresent energy as the propelling factor behind neurons and nuero-transmitters, I think no. What is his definition and status of mind in brain function, is not clear. You may help us Sanskritists to have a meaningful dialogue, as, like you, very few would work in both traditions.

  

Let me also add the Naiyayika's cognitive process - आत्मा --> मनस् --> इन्द्रियम् --> अर्थः/विषयः --> प्रत्यक्षम् which is an overlapping with that referred in Paniniya Siksha.

  

You may start a new thread for the benefit of other interested members.

  

Regards
