Namaste

1\. On oral surgeon: i think this maps in indian context to a Ear-Nose-Throat (ENT) specialist or Voice trainer training Speech and Hearing disorders. Is this correct as a technical skill or is it different? Unless this is clear, i need to unnderstand where to look for such a specialist- medical college or professional practitioner.

  

2\. On hardware spec to run the software: details required .

  

3.. reg. People with voice skills-training: what are the prescreening procedures to test voice consistency? If i need to analyze vedic tradition, my samples come in the age group of youngsters ( 12 to 20) routinely trained. Or seniors with experience in (45-60 plus) group.

  

Request clarifications.

  

Regards
