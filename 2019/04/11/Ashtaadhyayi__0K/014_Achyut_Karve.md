Dear Deshpandeji,

  

Thank you for your reflections on the subject.

  

This is how Dr. BVK Sastryji reflected on loss of accent in Sanskrit.

  

"Namaste

When language loses its intonation ( Svara: both as accent of veda. And sur- of samgeeth- music), the language ( and community) slides down on the scale of Spirituality ( Adhyaatma) towards social tribal language . This is called mlecchita.

  

When extreme loss of svara takes place, the degeneration and slip ( apa- bhramsha / praak. Kruta from Samskrutha status, unified to disassembled and distorted), the sacred language looses its mantra ability to transform human to divine. The grammars change. The godly use ( deva. Bhaashaa) looses its brahmee character. And ends as deshabhashaa.

  

This degenerative model of linguistics is called tower of babel based Biblical story narrative driving indology and IE linguistics studies.

  

Rest you can construct for yourself.

  

The samskruth link and influence over greek. Latin is ignored. Sanskrit is studied like english..

tell me what happens when man is studied as monkey!

  

Regards

  

BVK Sastry "

  

So loss of accent nay inability to sense it while reciting even among great commentators has eroded the aesthetic of Sanskrit. No wonder that Sanskrit scholars of the day see Sanskrit to be no better than any other language of the day. Nothing is achieved by calling Sanskrit a Dev Bhasha if the protagonists of the Sanskrit Language do not make an earnest effort to restore it's accent which encapsulates it's aesthetic.

  

From where or how this task can be initiated only Sanskrit scholars many of whom are on this list can tell.

  

As far as I am concerned i am trying to mark the accents of the Tabla compositions which have come down from the tradition.

  

I hope scholars on this list will attempt to do it for Sanskrit.

  

Achyut Karve.
