Dear Achyut Ji,

  

  The text of the Aṣṭādhyāyī is not available with trustworthy accentuation, and the few attempts that I have discussed in my article are not satisfactory. Ancient commentators like Kaiyaṭa and Nāgeśa have discussed this issue, sometimes coming with exactly opposite conclusions, and neither of them had in front of them an accented text.
The possibility of finding an ancient manuscript of the Aṣṭādhyāyī with full accentuation and nasalization etc. is remote. If someone finds such a text, I will be very happy.

  As for the accents of poetry including my own, the Sanskrit Kāvyaśāstra long ago declared: काव्यमार्गे स्वरो न गण्यते. Not a single Kāvya is available with accents, and the recitation of Kāvya today does not follow the Vedic accents.
