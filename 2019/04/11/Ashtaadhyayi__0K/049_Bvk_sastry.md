Namaste

  

To my limited understanding, the two lines of text and the kriyaa focus makes the issue clear:

  

> 
> > 
> > न पुनरन्तरेणाचं व्यञ्जनस्य ***उच्चारणमपि*** भवति । —. for uccharana- > the domain is vaikhari, indriya karma- sthana prayatna related. This > is physical, external ( baahya) physiological (indriya sambaddha) , > neurological.
> > 
> > 

  

  

> 
> > 
> > ... स्वयं ***राजन्ते स्वरा:*** अन्वग् भवति व्यञ्जनम्.
> > 
> > 

> 
> > 
> > भवति । —. for internalized cognition, inner vision, inward turned > speech, in a prior phase to articulation as’ maaruta karma’- - the > domain is madhyamaa,  Ateendriya- karma- smruti and vivakshaa related > ( that i will articulate alpa prana and not mahaprana or anunaasika) > which takes place before trigger of neurological physiological > functionality as sthana prayatna related. This is cognitive domain. > The root of ‘ raajante’ - raajru deeptau is not physical. It is > cognition, inner vision. >
> 
> > 

  

***Basis for this line of argument:*** Abhinavaguptas explanation of what is bhairava in malini vijayottara tantra, speaking on ‘ shiva-shakti- unmukhee karana’; four levels of vak analysis by patanjali as chatvaari vaak parimitaa padaani; Bhartruhari pointers through yontah pravishya mama vaacham imaam prasuptaam sanjeevayatyakhila shaktidharah swa-dhaamnaa; yajurveda-vak yajnena kalpataam; aatmamoolaa vaak.

  

I am open to suggestions and corrections . I do not know whether grammarians of classical schools ever explored the vak- yoga analytics and link it to mantrasaadhanaa. This is where maheswara sutras interpreted as shakti sutras comes in to fore.

  

This line of yoga approach to samskrutha varnaakshara is a living tradition in all three vedanta schools and inner sanctum of ochre cloth religious practice. Of course, academia has scant respect for these obscure issues inside the ochre clothe wrapped interpretations/ teachings.
