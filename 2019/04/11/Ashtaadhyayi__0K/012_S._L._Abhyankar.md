उपदेशेऽजनुनासिक इत् (1'3'2) demands that, if any vowel is अनुनासिक, it has to be so. Only then it is eligible to be considered to be इत्.

But most editions of अष्टाध्यायी do not script theअनुनासिक appropriately at all.

For example in स्वौजसमौट्... (4'1'2) the first component isसुँ i.e. (स् +उँ ) So, the सूत्रम् should be scripted as स्वौँजसमौट्...  

The crescent and dot is the स्वराङ्कनम् to denote thatउँ there isअनुनासिक.

Interpretation of manyसूत्र-s is done, considering suchस्वराङ्कन-s being there, albeit, implicitly.

If they can be explicit, interpretations and explanations would be much simpler and straightforward. They can be made explicit by proper scripting.

  

Any edition, which isस-स्वराङ्कन will be excellent and invaluable.
