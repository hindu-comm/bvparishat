No. Composing and writing are two different acts.

  

A composition stays in mind for a long time before it gets rendered in words!

You can experiment yourself. It also happens in letter writing, but we are not so careful.

It is how the brain functions. Many neural processes die before being converted to acoustics.  

  

Any way, I don't wish to argue further.
