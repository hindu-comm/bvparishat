First you have to locate an oral surgeon or an anatomist who may appreciate the singular

nature of each syllable. We have to understand our knowledge does not make it scientific.  

Together with the new expert, you recruit a dozen healthy young people (both men and

women) in their 30's who have fully mature organs indicated by their sound consistency.  

Between you and the expert you determine the degrees of freedom of the biological

system as enunciated by Panini. Let each syllable be independently uttered with "a" ending.

Let the expert decide on the number of degrees of freedom (this would be a discovery).

Once you ascertain a good set, we record through the software.  

  

Talk to many and evaluate before you nail down the expert.
