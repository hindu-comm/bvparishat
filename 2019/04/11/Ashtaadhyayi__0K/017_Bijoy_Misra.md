This is true. So we go to our pitch experiment.

We are in our very early stages to unravel the transformation

of a neural electrochemical signal to an acoustic signal.

The original signal is analog, we have to segment it for expression.

It has been difficult to find neuroscientists who can visualize the conversion.

Syllable as a unit of expression has to be scientifically analyzed.

All may not complete in my lifetime.  

  

The above text itself has syllables. The pitch is built in as I am writing.
