Namaste



(Technical issues cannot be responded in short responses, without losing the soul of the argument. Such issues unresolved remain like dormant killer cancer cells to vitiate a tradition. Please excuse and bear, in the interest of Swadeshi Samskrutham.).



1. The discussion is becoming interesting, deeper and technically complex,

especially with

 Prof. Deshpande bringing in Prof. Cardona's paper ( Year: 1969 ) for a referendum

and

Prof. Bijoy Misra's observation \< The brain does not know the tones. Tones are *vaikharI.. ....* This is true. So we go to our pitch experiment. We are in our very early stages to unravel the transformation of a neural electrochemical signal to an acoustic signal. The original signal is analog, we have to segment it for expression. It has been difficult to find neuroscientists who can visualize the conversion. Syllable as a unit of expression has to be scientifically analyzed. All may not complete in my lifetime. ..... **A syllable does not have a tone, but it has pitch. Tone is added in context. We do not know the mechanism of tone insertion. It is a function of information transfer. Gross vs subtle. It happens in light, night sky. The physics of body biology in making of sound is another nonlinear task. \>.



Before going further, i seek the considered opinion of scholars on what would be the best option out of **(3-A to 3-D)** below to explore, Scientifically ? This way, the present discussion is likely to bringing a fresh focus on

 (a) 'How to approach Sanskrit studies in 21 st century and align it to tradition ,

 by

 (b) Appropriate course corrections needed through 'Sanskrit Research', ' Study of Brahmi Language families' from *Bharateeya drushtikona* ( Indian traditional perspective).



 This is also an effort for finding out the basics of why Patanajli endorses 'Vak-Yoga' as vedic Term for 'Samskrutha Vyakaranam'.



2.  The study of Samskrutham as 'Vedanga Vyakarana / Uttara Vidyaa (Cardona)' - makes totally different sense when Panini is approached by positioning his work

in the TIME-LINE of 700 BCE:



***A time-Line for Samskruth Language -Grammar studies***:



( Vedas (?) -- RAMAYANA (??) -- Mahabharata ( 3100 BCE - ?? ) --
Panini (700 BCE) - Patanjali ( 200 BCE ?) -- Kashikaa, Bhartruhari ...... Bhattoji Deekshita (17th-century Maharashtrian Sanskrit grammarian, author of the Siddhānta-Kaumudī,) -- post colonial writers on Sanskrit Grammar like A.A.Macdonell (1927).... Oriental Contributors like Prof. S.D. Joshi and others.



 Following below\* (*see end of the point 3 *) , are relevant extracts from Prof. Cardonas paper may be worth revisiting and reviewing our post colonial Sanskrit studies.





3. **The picture of 'What Panini stands for' differs from the POV one takes in this studies and accommodates ' Muni-Traya Tradition' ! Here are the options:**



 - **(3A)** **One direction : explore what Panini made out of the language analytics tradition he inherited and what changes did he make to it ?** 



 (Would PIE logic be relevant for this ? My personal view is NO! There is too much of history -anthropology -indology noise in this segment).



 **-** **(3B) Second direction: objectively explore the ' Muni-Traya - grammarians tradition' and check how much of True Panini/
Patanjali/ Vedanga Vyakarana- is alive in-house ?? **

****

 (Would post colonial research helps in this area ? ? My personal view is- May be.

 There is too much unclear in the area of Indian Language scenario between Vyasa to Valmiki in Pre-Paninian period).



 - **(3C)Third direction: Explore the entire history of Samskruth language with the limited resolution lens going by ' Balamanorama commentary anchor of Siddhanta Kaumudi **

**MINUS Vaidika Prakriyaa ! and over dependence on 'Scripted Text, with limited understanding of the ' Ucchaarana' ! **

****

** (**The resolution of this lens is many times further reduced by limited scholarship of Sanskrit grammar using ' laghu siddhanta kaumudi, parama- laghu-paanineeyam

studies and teaching of select sections like Kaaraka and Samasa- Taddhita , with limited or no acquaintance with the PRAKRIYAA ( and Obviously the VAIDIKA SVARA-

PRAKRIYAA ).



 -**(3D)** **Fourth direction: Examine critically the entire history of Samskruth language study documented ROMANIZED BRAHMI DEVANAGARI SCRIPT /WITH IPA notation and all its concomitant , which has ' differential phoneme values' which vitiates the 'Shuddha Uccharana Criterion' of Patanjali? **

****

**May be one would be inclined to term this as 'Muted Sanskrit' research. **

**Within which one may position several dimensions of Hybrid Buddhist Sanskrit studies, Prakrit language studies as ' mlecchita'. **

****

**(**The resolution of this lens is made more complex with more distortions, dilutions and complexities on 'Sanskrit Language modeling hypothesis/ history/ Religion/ politics etc;) 



4. \* ***SELECT EXCERPTS FROM PROF.CARDONA's PAPER:** ***

******

******

(Page 3- First column ) I consider in detail the use of the sivasutras, in grammatical rules; comparative in that the rules in which the sivasutras are used are compared with rules of other Indian treatises. These treatises are of two kinds: those which deal with phonetic classification and Vedic morphophonemics-the Pratitskhyas, and more complete grammars such as the Katantra.



(Page 4- First column )There is, then, a need for detailed studies which will bring out clearly Panini's method and relate it with that of other Indian grammarians as well as with the methods of Western linguists. The present work is intended as one such study.



(Page 26- column 1) It would seem no less justified to assume, as some scholars have tacitly assumed (see below ?5.1), that there existed a single shiksha sound list with a universally accepted order. There is certainly disagreement in the available Pratishkhyas regarding the precise order of sounds and their phonetic description. There is no more substantial reason for assuming that there was

only one siksa text than for believing that there was originally only one Pratishakhya or that there was originally one single vyakarana text universally accepted. For vyakarana, it is well known that Panini himself attests to the existence of predecessors and of different opinions



(Page 34- column-1) Now, it is evident that, by prefacing his corpus of rules with a sound list, Panini is not breaking with tradition. It is equally evident that he assumes as largely valid for his grammar the traditional phonologic classifications and terminology.



(Page 35- second column) The other major changes which Panini made in traditional sound listings are not so much innovations as reorderings necessary to retain, in the pratyahara notation he had to adopt, distinct and pertinent classes of sounds recognized by previous classifications.



(Page 38- column-1) - While Panini excludes from the sivasutras some
sounds included in the lists of other treatises, he does include one sound which, properly speaking, should not be included in the lists of the Prdtisdkhyas. This is 1. As I have noted (ftn. 2), RPr. and VPr. do not include I in the list of samdndksara. Since the morphophonemic rules of the Prdtisdkhyas are meant to account for the relation between the pada and samhita texts, this omission is proper. The sound I occurs in forms of the root klp, and no morphophonemic rule involving the samaana- akshara need include I as an original sound to be modified.



(Page 41- Second column end ) The mania for maatralaaghava cannot be ascribed to Panini; it is a property of lesser original Indian grammarians.



(Page 42- Second and Third column) It is worth while emphasizing once more that the phonologic analysis which resulted in isolating classes such as svara, vyanjana, antahstha, usman, ghosavat, aghosa,etc. (1.1), clearly was not original with Panini. Nor can one conclude that this analysis was fully determined by the entire grammatical structure of the language. The siksha did not concern itself with rules encompassing the entire grammar of Sanskrit, nor did the Pratishakhyas. Panini drew from previous work,and, as we have seen, he was remarkably conservative in dealing with it. This is understandable.



(Page 42- Second column -end) **In bringing about the innovations he did, Panini truly contributed to vyakarana being entitled to the epithet uttara vidya.**
