Dear Scholars,



Do the Maheshwar Sutras have accent?

  

My opinion is they are not accented. Are there any views regarding the accent of the Maheshwar Sutras?

  

Is there any definition of Udatta, Annudatta, and Swarita other than that given in the Ashtaadhyayi namely, udatta-high pitched, annudatta-low pitched and swarita a blend of both?

  

Here is how I experience the external effort while articulating Annudatta, Udatta and Swarita.

  

Annudatta - lower jaw moves forward resulting in the contraction of the oral cavity.

  

Udatta - lower jaw moves backward resulting in the expansion of the oral cavity.

  

Swarita - the lower jaw remains normally positioned.

  

I would be grateful to receive comments on the above observations.
