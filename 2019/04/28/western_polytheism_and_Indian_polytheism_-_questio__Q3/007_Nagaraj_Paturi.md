There was a thread on the combination of 'polytheism' and 'monotheism' in the 'Hindu' tradition.

  

To avoid the words 'polytheism' and 'monotheism' ,

  

the thread was titled as

  

"Idea of devataavaividhya harmonious with ekatva of brahman"

  

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  

But the thread initiating post in the present thread is sharing an article where among other things, 'polytheism' in Hinduism is compared to the 'polytheism' in many other ancient world traditions.
