As per my understanding,  
Hinduism is Monotheistic as well as Polytheistic.

First of all, there is no connection of Advaita with this. Advaita only talks of Jeeva and Brahm being 1, not about Devas and Brahm being 1.  
Now, gods is a word which referd to Devas, and God is a word which refers to Brahm.

Devas are species, like humans, Rishis, or Rakshasas, they are species. Their Heirarchy is above humans and due to drinking of Amrita (Greek equivalent ambrosia, Norse equivalent is the apples of Iddun and so on), creatures of this specie don't die. They die (tirobhaava) at Kalpanta (Pralaya), which is basically present in all cultures, take for example Ragnarok. In Ragnarok, all gods die and after it, there is creation again.

Devas fall in the category of Jeeva. They are "Bhagawan" because they posses 6 Dharmas.

Now, coming to God. He is Almighty. When we say this, we literally mean he is 1. For in a class, there can be only 1 person who comes 1st. This God, who is Almighty, is referred to as Brahm or Brahman.  
He is the creator.

There are NirishwaravAdis in Hinduism, but they're not Atheists. Hinduism isn't Atheistic in nature. These NirishwaravAdis only dejy the existence of such an Almighty Ceator God. But like Sankhyakas, Meemamsakas and Greeks and Nordic people, these streams also believe in the gods and worship them through different Karma, Yajnas etc.

These gods are not Almighty, they can be defeated by strong humans, these gods are not Allknowing and haven't created the Universe. But still are worshipped. Such streams according to me are Polytheistic streams in Hinduism. Like Greek and Norse Mythology, these streams also don't believe in God but haventheir own gods and tales.
