In my opinion we should not fight shy of polytheism in Hinduism. What is wrong in polytheism? From Vedic times Hinduism follows both monotheism as well as polytheism. Let it be a specialty of Hinduism. Polytheism evolves out of true democratic spirit. Every individual has the right to choose his or her own ista devata. Sri Shankaracharya is called a monist. But he has sung almost on all deities. In fact he is the organizer of the sanmatas. There is no contradiction at all. There is unity in diversity. Even Charvaka, Budddhism and Jainism are not condemned. They are only called as avaidika darsanas. Polytheism leads to broad mindedness. If you can respect worshippers of several gods in your own religion, you are likely to respect other religions as well. Just because in Abrahamic religions, there is predominance of monotheism there is no need that every other religion must follow suit.
