Sir, I wanted to respond since you said in your earlier posting that Hindu polytheism is a misnomer. It is not and we can justifiably be proud of it. Polytheism is not a problem even for Vedanta. Who can be a better Vedantin than Shri Shankaracharya who has glorified so many Gods. If Rama and Krishna are viewed as different gods there is polytheism. If they are viewed as incarnations of the same Lord Vishnu there is monotheism. Similarly if both Lord Vishnu and Lord Shiva are viewed as Parabrahmasvarupas there is no conflict. Polytheism does not affect Vedanta, nor does Vedanta contradict Polytheism. The Ghataakasa and the mathakasa seem to be different but are not essentially different. They are different only from the point of view of the upadhi which is impermanent after all.
