Namaste.

Summarising my contribution in the thread pointed to by Prof. N. Paturi:

"Vedanta is another sect of Hinduism, with {Brahman, brahmA} as its {ishTa and/or puruSha devatA} respectively.

All sects have their own ishTa and/or puruSha devatA, and nobody gave any other sect or set of people permission to speak for them."

A deity - well known or not - is already worth a hundred thousand books of theory.
