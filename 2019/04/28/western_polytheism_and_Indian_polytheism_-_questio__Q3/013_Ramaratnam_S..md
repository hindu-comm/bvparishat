This is in response to the views of Dr. Rukmini. I adore Dr. Rukmini for her scholarship. Her works on the commentaries of Yogasutra are worth their weight in gold. But I am not in a position to agree with her views in this thread. Yes, from the Western point of view, the distinction between philosophy and religion needs to be maintained and is necessary.They take pleasure in segregation, compartmentalization and exclusivity. We, in India, look for integration, synthesis and inclusivity. It is not for us to decide which is better of the two. Both have their own beauty. The milk is tasty, the mango is sweet, independently but the mango milk shake has got its own deliciousness.
In Indian context, religion and philosophy are not water tight compartments exclusive of each other. Even the great philosopher Madhusudana Saraswati said, कृष्णात् परं किमपि तत्त्वमहं न जाने. Monotheism talks about one God. Polytheism talks about several Gods. God and religion are inseparable. So the topics on Monotheism and Polytheism, though philosophically oriented, are still connected with religion. May be it is Religious Philosophy or the Philosophy of Religion. Dr. Rukmini Madam, please bear with me for my indulgence.
