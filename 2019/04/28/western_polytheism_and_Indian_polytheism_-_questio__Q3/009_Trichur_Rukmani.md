Are we not conflating a philosophical approach with a religious one. The Monistic idea is a purely philosophical understanding of whatever is stated in upteen Hindu sacred texts. With so many devatās/devas crowding our texts surely one is free to practise religion towards a preferred deity (iṣṭadevata-lokānām bhinna ruciḥ). But in my view the distinction between philosophy and religion needs to be maintained and is necessary.
