I too don't think that 'Hinduism' is Henotheistic. I just wanted to mention the word Henotheistic when I looked at the word Unitheistic. The whole point is that we have several different intricate ways of combinations of Devataavaividhya with Bhagavadekatva or Brahma/Iswara ekatva which can not be translated through any idea of 'polytheism' or 'monotheism' combination of 'polytheism' and 'monotheism', in Vedic tradition or 'Hinduism'.
