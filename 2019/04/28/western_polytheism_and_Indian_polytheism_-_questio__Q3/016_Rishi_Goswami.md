Namaste to all scholars.

I maybe wrong, but I don't agree with the Henotheistic part. Parsis are Henotheistic, a word coined by Muller.

In Polytheism, there can be no God. There only exists species (jeeva), which fall higher in heirarchy to humans (following the anand degrees mentioned in taittiriya), they can be defeated and are thus in constant threat of their seat being snatched away by some victorious mortal, this is the case in most mythologies.

If we say God, it can be only 1. There can't be more than 1 Almighty. If he's Almighty, he has to be 1, for only 1 person can win the race, or only 1 can top the class. That tatva is 1, but has capacity to take various forms. Like sea, river, well, all are one Tatva/Element - H2O.

Hence, Henotheistic can't be the term. No Vedanti or No Hindu sect denies the existence of other Devas to be worshiped, but all others fall in Jeeva category other than the Ishta. By Vedantic Concepts, they are all parts of a whole. So, even a spark is considered fire, these Devas are also not different from God (or even are), but the Mularupatva is all what the fight is about.

Henotheism is when Gods are low and 1 God among them is highest in heirarchy. So, they have various Devas, it is basically Polytheism but one of the immortals has been made head.

So, Hinduism can either be Mono or Poly, there can't be Heno. Eother we have 1 God, and all other Devas are just Jeevas with special powers, or we have No God, and just these Devas with special powers.

Haraye Namah.
