Dear scholars,

The following article which appeared in 'India Facts', a web journal, may be seen.

The writer is talking about the genocide of gods by the west.

My query is about the nature of polytheism in the west. We know that the Hindu polytheism is a misnomer. Upanishads, our primary texts, talk of one reality, the infinitely existing consciousness, manifesting/appearing as the universe. Whatever god forms we have are mere visualizations in that reality. The Brihadaranyaka Upanishad clarifies further about the 33 koti gods by explaining how koti is a category and not a numeral. It says how they are all the forms of one reality (Sakalya brahmanam- Br.Up). The entire non-dual philosophy is about this.

Is there some such philosophical explanation for the polytheism of Greece and Raome. Probably it was there and lost?
