God is considered as infinite. Actually beyond numbers. So beyond even infinity. At the same time encompassing everything including numbers and infinity. Human beings with their limited intelligence are incapable of visualizing this idea. They have to imagine god as infinite, or as one, or as many.  So, any one of these views is neither superior nor inferior to the others. 

  

My humble 2 cents.

  

Regards,

Radhakrishna Warrier
