Dear Shri Sivasenani Nori ji:-

  

While a common script for all of India might work for some things, it might not work at all for others.

  

Political, Economic, Social, Tech, Legal and Economic factors need to be considered before any idea can be judged as feasible or otherwise. State fiats will not work on socio-cultural issues (especially in a confused democracy such as India's) which is what the adoption of a new script essentially is.

GB Shaw's quote would apply to paradigm shifting ideas where the producers and the consumers of an innovation are two distinctly different sets of people AND the adoption curve is less steeper than before for the end consumer.

Consider digital watches, ipods and similar stuff.

  

If tomorrow people could learn a language as easy as NEO plugging himself into a kung-fu cd, this adoption might be easy.  

  

Not otherwise.

  

Regards,

  

Venkat
