Humour makes life worth living.

  

Who is the lead person in this "effort" ?

  

Now all we have to do is retype all the tons of material in Devanagari and convert into Bharati and hey presto the OCR works on this.

  

I am confused here. Where does Optical Character Recognition come in when the I/P is a script namely Bharati in this case ? Or do they really plan on touching their nose from behind their head by scanning Bharati and feeding it to the "OCR"?
