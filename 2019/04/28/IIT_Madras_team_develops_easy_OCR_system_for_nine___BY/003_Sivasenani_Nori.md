If one script is required across India, it could easily be Devanagari with some modifications, if required. It seems the idea was to have a nice three layered 'scientific' script. Now, one does not know how useful such a script would be. While we have seen newer scripts being adopted - Modi to Devanagari for Marathi, Urdu to Gurumukhi for Punjabi - by and large, changing a script is a process which is hugely expensive and requires a State fiat. Most reasonable people would not try such a thing, but then as George Bernard Shaw said, an unreasonable man persists in trying to adapt the world to himself (and so all progress depends on the unreasonable man).

  

Also, on the brighter side older people can stay mentally healthy if they learn a new language, er, a new script.
