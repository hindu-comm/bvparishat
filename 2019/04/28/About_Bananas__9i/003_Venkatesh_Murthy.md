Namaste

  

Bananas and honey is served to the Pitru and Vishve Deva Brahmanas in Sraddha. The Brahmanas eat it and we imagine it has reached our Pitrus. They say Pitrus very much like Madhu. They chant the Madhu Sukta and serve Madhu to Pitrus. Pitrus are satisfied by feeding Brahmanas this way and they will bless us.
