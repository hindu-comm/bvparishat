As per apastamba, in pratyabdhika shrAddham, one has to offer a little amount of vegetable curry in the agni to prajApati. Tamil and Kerala apastambins always offer raw banana curry for this ahuti.

Is also mandatory to cook raw banana curry for anna shraddha, in these regions. In fact there is a local saying that 3 items from Banana plant is mandatory for shraddha viz., banana leaf (for serving), banana fruit, and raw banana curry. Some people add the 4th - banana stem (thandu).

Venkateswaran
