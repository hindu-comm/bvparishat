Dear friends,

  

Whitney says in 53 (b):

  

The semi-vowels "r" and "l" are widely interchangeable in Sanskrit, both in roots and suffixes, and even in prefixes. There are few roots containing l which do not show also forms with r. words written with one letter are found in other texts, or in other parts of the same text, written with the other. ....

  

End quote.

  

My question is do you have some examples of "There are few roots containing l which do not show also forms with r. words written with one letter are found in other texts, or in other parts of the same text, written with the other."

  

Regards
