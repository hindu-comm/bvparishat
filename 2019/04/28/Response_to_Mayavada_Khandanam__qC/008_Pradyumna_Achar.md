Thanks to everyone for the pointers.

As I am studying Mayavada Khandanam formally (not self-study), I thought it would be good to refer to point-wise responses to the same, if available.

The blog mentioned is too informal and ridden with mistakes, right from introductory statements such as"vimatham is “whether advaita can be started or not”". I will read it anyway to see if there is anything of value hidden in it.
