But Sankara Bhashya is not a point by point refutation of Mayavada Khandana. We have to see where is a book for that. One or two years back there was a book by Chennai scholars as a point by point refutation of all points written against Advaita by Jayateertha in Nyaya Sudha. Advaita Siddhi is very big and not easy to understand. But these two books will cover all points against Advaita from Madhvacharya and his followers. Why? Because Jayateertha and Vyasa Raya have given the most detailed criticism and we have two books for answering that.

  

In Advaita List we have given responses to many points against Advaita by Vaadiraaja in Nyaya Ratnavali and Yuktimallika.
