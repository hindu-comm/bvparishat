Dear friends,

Good morning.  

We are studying 17th and 18th century history to try reconstruct society of the period.

I would like to seek reference material from the local historians and analysts on the  

development of Maratha nation. Books in English and Hindi are better.
I can handle

some Marathi.

Please help if you have written anything or you know of material that you trust.

You can write to me privately or post here.

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
