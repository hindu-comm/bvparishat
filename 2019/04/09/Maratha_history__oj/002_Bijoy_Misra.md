Madhavji,

  

As you can imagine, I can't be a specialist on the topic, but I must

create a view of Maratha in the context of India's history and the  

follow up British. So I am looking for a critical scholarly view in the  

larger context of India. The culture is deep, I myself lived in Pune.  

I need to position Shivaji's rise and apparent terror of Peshva rule  

in their proper context. Please point one or two books that I can  

handle. I got the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan (Majumdar) books by mail.

  

Is Rise of Maratha Power a good resource? A reprint is listed in

Amazon. Another?  

  

Thank you.
