Dear Madhavji,

I did request the book by M G Ranade and the three volumes by GS Sardesai

from the Library. I am grateful for the help. India is vast. I have to also handle  

Vaishnava movement in Assam and the massive Bhakti literature from the south.  

Hopefully I and our group have an understanding (however raw) by next year.

Best regards,

Bijoy
