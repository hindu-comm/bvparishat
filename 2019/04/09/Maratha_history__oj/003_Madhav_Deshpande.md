Ranade's *Rise of the Maratha Power*is foundational in the sense it is the first comprehensive account based on documents and modern notions of history in the 19thcentury. Here are some useful readings in English which may be available at the Harvard library near you. They cover the period from the rise of the Marathas to the transition to the arrival of the British rule. This is just a small sample from a rather vast field of research.

  

Sardesai, G.S. New History of the Marathas, Vols I, II, III

  

Sardar G.B. The Saint Poets of Maharashtra (Their impact on Society)

  

Gokhale B.G. Poona in the Eighteenth Century.

  

Varma S.J. Mountstuart Elphinstone in Maharashtra

  

Kumar Ravinder Western India in the Nineteenth Century
