In the chapter "In Bihar" of his book "Sketches of Ceylon and India" (in Russian) published in 1878, Vol.1, page 190, Prof. Ivan Minayev says:

  

"They say that the famineof 1770, and the attack of Marathas, preceding that, led the city to its present state. Since then, it has not recovered, although to this day it has a commercial significance; through Bihar, not lying on the bank of a navigable river, and far from the railroad, considerable trade is being carried out between the cities of Patna, Gaya, Hazaribaghand Munger."

  

I have not come across any book dealing with attack of Marathas in Bihar in 1760s. Could anybody suggest any relevant book on this topic ?
