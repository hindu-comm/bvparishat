Dear Bijoy Ji,

  

  Maratha history has been intensively studied for at least 150+ years. You can begin your reading with the foundational book "The Rise of Maratha Power" by Mahadeo Govind Ranade. There are many volumes written by G.S. Sardesai, Kincaid, Shejwalkar, Surendra Nath Sen and many others. Voluminous source materials are available in Marathi publications, the most noted is a series published by V. K. Rajwade under the title: मराठ्यांच्या इतिहासाची साधने, and the other series titled: Selections from the Peshwa Daftar. Documents from many Maratha royal houses like Holkar, Shinde, Gaikwad etc. have been collected and published. Several collections of documents from the Shivaji period have been published. The original documents are mostly in Marathi written in the modi script, but voluminous sources are available in Sanskrit, Persian, Portuguese, French and English accounts. A good deal of them have now been published and translated.
