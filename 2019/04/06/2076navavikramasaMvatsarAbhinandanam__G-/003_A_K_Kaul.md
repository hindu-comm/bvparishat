Shri Nagaraj Paturiji,

Jai Shri Ram!

1\. Vasanta Ritu, as per all the Puranas and siddhantas and even Panchangas including the Rashtriya Panchanga, started on February 18, 2019.

2. The first new moon after that date was on March 7, 2019. That was the start of the new lunar year known as Vasanti Navratra/Gudi Padva/Chaitri Navratra as per all the Puranas and siddhantas.

It should have been celebrated on that all over India.

3\. Greeshma ritu will start as per all the siddhantas, Puranas and Panchngas, including the Rashtriya Panchanga, on April 21, 2019.

By celebrating Vasanti Navratras today, it means we do not expect Vasanta Ritu to last for more than fifteen days instead of for about two months.
