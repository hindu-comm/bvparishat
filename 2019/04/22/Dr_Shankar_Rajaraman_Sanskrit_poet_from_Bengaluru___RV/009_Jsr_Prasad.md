Respected Sir,

  

We use to have an MoU with FRLHT, Bengaluru. They had published kṣemakutūhalam with English translation. Entire translation was done by Dr. Shankar ji. I called him over phone sometime around 2014 to congratulate for his work. He was working for his PhD at NIAS, that time.

  

That is how I found him to be a very humble scholar!

  

Thanks and regards!
