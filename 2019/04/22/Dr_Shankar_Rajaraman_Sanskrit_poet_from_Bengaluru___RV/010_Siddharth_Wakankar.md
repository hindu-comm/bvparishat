Dr.Prasad,

  

He translated the Bhojanakutuhalam( part I) and I was present at FRLHT in August 2010 for that book.releasing function,as I was invited by Prof. M A.Lakshmithathachar for lecturing on Msslogy.

  

Thereafter,I think,he translated the Kshemakutuhalam. A copy of that Bhojanakutuhalam book is with me.

  

It is a very good work, sincerely done by him with much precision and scholarship.

  

FRLHT should take up the Editing and translation of the remaining two parts of Bhojanakutuhalam which are still in manuscript form.Then it will be a complete set of that wonderful and exhaustive Text.

  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
