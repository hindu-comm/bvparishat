Dear Shiv,

  

Am very happy that still you remember the wonderfully crafted and neatly executed workshop on MSS.logy which I conducted in Bangalore.

  

Do put that knowledge to good use and consult Prof. Prasad whenever you need guidance.

  

By the way,what are you doing at present and working in which topic.

  

Best luck in your a scenic career.

  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
