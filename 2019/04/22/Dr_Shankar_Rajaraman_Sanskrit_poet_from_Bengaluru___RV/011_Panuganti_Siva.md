गुरुभ्यो नमः,

  

I am writing this mail with my own interest to share my views.

  

By the grace of Prof. Prasad Sir, I got a wonderful opportunity to work in FRLHT during 2013 to 2015.

  

It was a great fortunate for me to have direct interaction with Dr. Shankar Sir.

  

He is friendly in nature and very much motivational.

  

My heartfelt congrats to Dr. Shankar Sir for your great achievement.

  

धन्यवादाः

Siva Panuganti
