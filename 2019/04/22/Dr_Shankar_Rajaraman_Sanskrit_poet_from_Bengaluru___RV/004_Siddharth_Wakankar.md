Dear Prof.Paturi,

  

I am very happy and proud that Dr. Shankar Rajaraman is one of my former students in Bangalore.

  

He is basically a Psychiatrist by education besides being a very good Sanskrit scholar and poet.

  

He has combined his skills from both these fields for his doctorate degree and still continues to work even after his getting the degree.

  

His contact details are:

  

tryaksha@ [gmail.com](http://gmail.com) and his contact number is 9740091530.

  

You may contact him anytime and he will respond favourably.

  

May his scholarship help both the fields and enrich us.

  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.

Vadodara.9427339942.
