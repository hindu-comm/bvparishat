A PG Degree in modern medical science in one hand and avadhaana-prakriyaa coupled with excellent poetic skills on the other hand, makes him an outstanding doctor-poet. Though I never met him in person, I found him to be very humble in nature.

  

May he achieve more such accolades for his contributions to the tradition and modernity. Hearty congratulations Dr. Shankar Rajaraman!

  

Regards
