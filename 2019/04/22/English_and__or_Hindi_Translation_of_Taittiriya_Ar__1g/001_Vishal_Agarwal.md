For Hindi translation of all 10 Prapathakas, refer to:

  

Taittiriya Aranyaka with Sayanabhashya and a Hindi translation by Dr Jamuna Pathak, Chaukhamba Sanskrit Series Office: Varanasi

  

For English translation of the Aranyaka Prapathakas 1-6 only (The Shiksha, Varuni and Yajniki Upanishads are left out because the first two constituting Taittiriya Upanishad are available easily, and the YajnikiMahanarayana Up is translated by Swami Vimalananda, P Lal and so on) in two volumes:

  

<https://www.exoticindia.com/book/details/taittiriya-aranyaka-krishna-yajur-veda-text-in-devanagari-translation-and-notes-set-of-2-volumes-NAM944/>  

  

Both of these works are easily available from market and are recent.  

  

Translations of individual Prapathakas like Aruna Prashna and Chityupanishad (Pr III) etc are available in Hindi and English separately two and I am not listing them.

  

Regards,  

  

Vishal Agarwal
