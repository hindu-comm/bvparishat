Respected Prof. Deshpande,

  

Let us divide your target /task into four parts.

  

1\. Various interpretations to the same expressions in the Gita

  

2\. Various interpretations toto the same expressions in the Upanishads

  

3\. Various padacchedas to the same padacombinations in the Gita

  

4\. Various padacchedas to the same padacombinations in the Upanishads

  

# 1 was requested by Sri Krishna Kashyap-ji and you yourself helped him out.

  

#3 & # 4 can not be too big in number. So it can all be covered as one page list for #3 and another one page list for #4.

  

#2 is a good researchable topic. It is probably covered by researchers in their research works in parts ; but I I don't think there is a comprehensive collection of all those at one place.
