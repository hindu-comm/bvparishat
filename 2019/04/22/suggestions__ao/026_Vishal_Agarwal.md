I had spoken to the proprietor of the publishing company two years ago on the phone in detail but he expressed his helplessness over the cost. He is a small publisher, and their volumes are bound by hand, using acid free paper. He said that sales are low, and he gets them printed on demand and so costs are high. Thereafter, I had approached Dr Tsoukalas too (he is my Facebook friend) and he too expressed his inability to influence the publisher.

  

The volumes are actually even more expensive than I had initially stated. Amazon sells 4 of the 6 and their average cost is over $300 per volume. And very few Universities in the US have more than a volume or 2 in their libraries. Colorado State has the entire set.

  

As Dr Deshpande notes below, these volumes are the only edition that give the multiple possible meanings (or semantic range) of each word with some grammatical notes, interpretations of the 3 Acharyas, and of modern interpreters and others also (especially Robert Minor, Zaehner, Sargeant, Douglas Hill, Edgerton) on practically every verse in English. If there are other similar works, I am not aware of them.

  

With regards,
