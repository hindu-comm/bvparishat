Namaskar,

  

Here are some pointers towards the literature already available.

  

I. UPANISHADS

  

The books that compare various commentaries verse for verse for Upanishads are typically out of print. For instance, the two volumes on the three Atharvana Upanishads by J K Dave by BVB, and their volume on Isha and Kena Up as well by Gajendragadkar which was recently reprinted and is available from Amazon. For various Upanishads, here are some references (English works only as requested):

  

  

1\. The Ten Classical Upanisads, vol I (Isa and Kena) by P B Gajendragadkar. BVB 1981

  

2\. Thirteen Principal Upanisads vol II (Mandukya with Karikas) by Jayantkrishna Dave, BVB 1990. He adds comments from modern works by Karmakar and Bhattacharya but ignores the traditional Vishishtadvaita and Dvaita commentaries on the Upanishad + Agama Prakarana. Even for Advaita, Anandagiri and other subcommentators are ignored.

  

3\. Thirteen Principal Upanisads vol I (Prasna and Mundaka Upanisads). BVB 1988

  

4. For Mahanarayana Upanishad, a comparison of Sayana and Bhattabhaskara here and there in Swami Vimalananda's translation (R K Mission)  

  

5. A Critical Study of the Kausitaki Brahmana Upanisad with its Available Commentaries. S R Matha. Sri Venkateswara University (Tirupati) 1999  

  

6\. For Ishavasya, another useful (though with a Vishishtadvaita bias) is

Isavasyopanishad Bhashya by Sri Vedanta Desika criticall edited with intro, trans and notes by K C Varadachari. Vedanta Desika Research Society (Madras), 1975  

  

7\. There is another similar volume on Taittiriya Upanishad too - will need to dig out the reference.

  

I am not aware of similar comparative studies (except in a summary manner) of different Bhashyas verse by verse or para by para for Chh Up, Ait, Brh Up, Shv Up etc and of course there will be none for Mait Up. For summary studies comparing the three major Vedantic traditions, there are three volumes covering the Prasthanatrayi but with a Vishishtadvaita Bias. Likewise, there are volumes covering Upanishads and Gita from a Dvaita bias. I am not including similar works on the Brahmasutras as there are plenty (B N Sharma and so on).  

  

II\. GITA

1\. Bhagavad Gita, an exegetical commentary by Robert Minor, South Asia Books: Out of Print. Covers the three main Bhashyas and Shridharaswami along with a host of western commentators and modern Indian commentators. In my opinion, Minor gives too much space to trivial modern interpretations and often his arguments for accepting one traditional interpretation over the other are not very sound. He gives the variants from Bhaskara relying on Buitenen's work but does not really refer to Bhaskara's interpretations.  

  

2\. Geetarnava Ratnamala 1989. V Srinivasan (New Delhi). This is rare and out of print and the only reason I have a hard copy is that the Ashram has a branch here in Minnesota. In my opinion, this is the most comprehensive compilation of comments from various commentaries under each verse in very brief, leaving out totally sampradaya specific arguments. He covers all the Vedantacharya commentaries, their subcommentaries, and many other works - old and modern. The quotes are random, meaning that each verse does not reproduce the interpretation from each and every commentator but only those that the compiler felt were important to him in English.

  

3\. Six volumes by Steven Tsoukalas published by Edwin Mellen Press, Lewiston (NY) from 2007-2015. They give a detailed interlinear translation frequently referring to Shankara, Ramanuja, Madhva under most of the verses. Among modern commentators, he refers to Davies, Douglas Hill, Minor, Bhaktivedanta and sometimes a few others. There is extensive grammatical analysis and padachheda for each and every verse. Gives variants from Kashmirian text, Bhaskara and sometimes discusses them. But skips other traditional commentaries altogether These volumes are ridiculously expensive (over $1000 for the set) and very few US libraries even carry even individual volumes (let alone the entire set). This particular set would meet the requirements of the request very closely for the Gita.

  

Then of course there are numerous works on the Gita like Word Indices (I have 3 with me), Gita's grammar (I have two with me) and so on but I will not list them here.

  

Regards,

  

Vishal Agarwal
