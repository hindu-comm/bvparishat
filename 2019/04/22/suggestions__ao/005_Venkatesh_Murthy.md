Namaste

  

There was some discussion in the Advaita list about the Vedanta philosophy itself before Adi Sankara and during his time. At that time there was no Visistadvaita and no Dvaita or no Dvaita-Advaita philosophy. Bheda-Abheda also came later. It means Advaita was the only Vedanta Philosophy in Adi Sankara's time. There were other Advaitapara philosophies like Mandana Misra's Brahma Siddhi. I am trying to say Advaita was the dominant or only philosophy of the Upanishads at that time.

  

Why I am saying all this? Because Geeta is the milk of the Upanishad cows only. If Upanishad philosophy at Adi Sankara's time or before him was Advaitapara it means Geeta philosophy ORIGINALLY when it was written was Advaitapara. Padaccheda must be according to Adi Sankara only because he was following Advaita. It is also a misconception to think he started Advaita Vedanta. It was there long before him enshrined in the Upanishads.

  

What it means now? Later commentators from non Advaita schools had to change the Padaccheda and the text itself to fit the pet philosophy like Visistadvaita, Dvaita, and so on.

  

Any person reading Geeta has to remember this when reading it.
