I am able to read online the volume 4 of Tsoulakas (Bhagavadgita Adhyāyas 10-11) on Stanford University Library website and it looks comprehensive in its coverage of multiple interpretations including those of Śaṅkara, Rāmānuja, Madhva and several others, including modern interpreters. It would be very nice if a more affordable edition of these volumes ever comes out. Even the Stanford Library seems to have electronic access only to this volume. My two year visiting appointment at Stanford ends in August, and then my access to Stanford Library also ends.
