Dear Scholars,

  

I am facing the problem of splitting the compositions of the Tabla into paddas as no pada pathas of the composition are available.

  

Take the simplest example

  

धा धा तीटsधा धा ती ना

ता ता ती टs धा धा ती ना

  

Can the composition be split into padas without taking into account the places of intonation?

  

What will happen if the intonation markings are considered to be superfluous?

  

By giving sanction to overlook intonation have we not converted an unambiguous text into an ambiguous one.

  

Patanjali has commented on this aspect of Sanskrit and has warned us of its disastrous effects.

  

My questionis, are the present Shiksha texts sufficient to help us reconstruct the intonations of the texts so as to extract unambiguous sense.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve
