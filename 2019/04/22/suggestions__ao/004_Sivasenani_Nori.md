Like, श्वेतकेतो तत्त्वमसि / श्वेतकेतो౽तत्त्वमसि is what the learned Professor means, I guess.

  

I wonder if there are enough such, for a book-length treatment. The differences are more about what is mukhya and what is gauNa amongst bhedavaakyas and abhedavaakyas. Also, between the Sankaracharya's bhashya and Rangaramanujacharya's bhashya on the Upanishads, my impression was that the latter follows the former for most part of the text. The 250 or so Vedic sentences quoted in Brahmasutras and at a stretch, the 2,200 Shruti vaakyas quoted by Sankaracharya's in his bhashya are where most differences in interpretation would be located.

  

Comparatively, the Bhagavad-Gita as interpreted by different Acharya differs significantly (only comparatively speaking, it may be repeated) in the text itself. Even there, the differences in interpretation of text such as what words like karma, akarma, vikarma mean or who the different Purushas are much more prominent than differences in interpretation due to padachcheda is the impression I have.

  

It will be very interesting to read differences due to padachcheda therein.

  

We do find differences in the Vedanta Sutras, though, in splitting of the Sutras apart from division into Adhikaranas (which means there is a difference in topic division itself) and the number of Sutras as well. Off hand, I recollect the comparative study (A Critique of Brahmasutras) by Dr. P M Modi in early 1900s where some of these may be found. The foreword by George Thibaut to his translation of Sri Bhashya also contains a good summary of the differences between Saankarabhaashya and Sribhaashya, though one does not recollect discussion of any differences due to Padachcheda strictly speaking (though splitting of Sutras is noted therein).
