I am looking for some English language book or article that discusses how passages from the Bhagavadgītā or Upaniṣads have been subjected to multiple *padacchedas*and interpretations by different commentators. I have most of the Sanskrit commentaries, but I need to provide some reading materials for a few readers who are interested in this phenomenon, but don't read Sanskrit commentaries. Any suggestions?
