There are infinite advaita groups but why turn BVP into one.more \[though professed to be objective and inclusive\] ?

  

--- That is what BVP management too believes.  
  

I joined only because some vaishnavas were associated and thought pramanika, free-thought is encouraged.

  

  

\- ----- You might remember many occasions during which I asserted that BVP is not an Advaita group or sides can not be taken . You might remember that I did this at the risk of incurring displeasure from some highly respected members of the group.

  

S I request highly respected members like you not to get the impression that the tilt towards one school of Vedanta or the other in postings is going to be allowed in the list.

  

So, unmoderated members resort to such biases and the posts land here. We bring the member under moderation.

  

Debates among schools of Vedanta or debates between Vaidika and avaidika Indic schools when run in a well argued or well substantiated fashion are welcome. But posting claims and conclusions of a particular school of Vedanta without substantiation is discouraged on this list and if continues after caution can lead to loss of membership.

  

Since never was suchposting claims and conclusions of a particular school of Vedanta without substantiation allowed without being pointed out or controlled on this list , please don't get disappointed and don't let others get disappointed.
