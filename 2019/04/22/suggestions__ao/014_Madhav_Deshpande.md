Thanks, Nagaraj Ji and other BVP members for suggestions. My question originated in a discussion we had in a group of Marathi seniors that periodically meets here in San Jose, California, and there was some interest among members of this group to know a few examples where the same text is interpreted differently by different commentators. This is not a group of Sanskrit scholars, but people who have a general interest in Indian traditions. Based on all the suggestions I have received, I can have my next conversation with our group. As Nagaraj Ji suggests, it would be a great scholarly project to collect such instances comprehensively. Thanks everyone.
