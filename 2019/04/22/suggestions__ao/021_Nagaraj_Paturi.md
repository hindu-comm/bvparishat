Dear Sriram,

  

Making statements such as

  

'Advaitins do the following padaccheda' or 'Advaitins interpret the following word in this way'

  

are not sectarian.

  

'This statement in Gita*has*Advaita in it' or 'originally Gita had this Advaitic content only, later people from the other schools of Vedanta twisted it to their advantage' etc., are sectarian.

  

It is not wrong to take a position say of Advaita and argue for it in a scholarly and respectful way with another scholar who takes a position say of Dvaita or Visishtaadvaita or vice versa.
