Dear Sir,

This argument is **sectarian** couched in a historical cover which falls off quickly. You may have several reasons to carry out pada-vibhaaga in your own way and to interpret Sanskrit texts. But the purported logic of historical considerations is wrong. Like BG, Narayaneeya ( aka EkAyana? I have to verify) is also found in the Mahabharata. This is one of the foundations of Vis'is'TAdvaita. In MB itself this is eulogized as coming out of the mouth of BhagavAn, like BG. Hence historically, in the time of MB, ( long before Shankaracharya's Advaita) the philosophical foundations of Vis'is'TAdvaita existed.

I would be glad if you can disprove me with properly verifiable (objective) historical foot prints.
