There are various stories in the public domain on the naming of Lord Krishna as “Kṛṣṇa”. The most prevalent seems to be that he was so named because of his dark complexion (Sanskrit kṛṣṇa = black.)  The movie song “… राधा क्यों गोरी, मैं क्यों काला? …” seems to be an example of this public perception. But Mēlpattūr Nārāyaṇa Bhaṭṭatiri (മേല്പത്തൂർ നാരായണ ഭട്ടതിരി मेल्पत्तूर् नारायण भट्टतिरि - 1560–1646 CE) seems to have a different explanation for the name “Kṛṣṇa”.  Bhaṭṭatiri was a an astronomer and a mathematician, but he is more famous for his Sanskrit work *N**ārāyaṇīyam* in praise of Lord Krishna of Guruvāyūr temple.  In *N**ārāyaṇīyam* he briefly describes the naming ceremony of Lord Krishna.  At the invitation of Nanda Gopa, Garga muni arrives for the naming ceremony of the child Krishna. It is Garga who gives the Lord the name “Kṛṣṇa”.  Here is an excerpt from daśaka 44 of *N**ārāyaṇīyam*:

കൃഷിധാതുണകാരാഭ്യ‍ാം സത്താനന്ദാത്മത‍ാം കിലാഭിലപത്

ജഗദഘകര്‍ഷിത്വം വാ കഥയദൃഷ്ടിഃ കൃഷ്ണനാമ തേ വ്യതനോത്

कृषिधातुणकाराभ्यां सत्तानन्दात्मतां किलाभिलपत् ।

जगदघकर्षित्वं वा कथयदृषि: कृष्णनाम ते व्यतनोत् ॥

“The putting together of the root of the verb Krish and the suffix N, denoting the combining of Existence and absolute Bliss, which is Thy real nature, declaring, the sage gave Thee the name Krishna. Also signifying the drawing away of the sins of the people of the world, the name Krishna was given to Thee.” (English translation from: <http://www.narayaneeyam-firststep.org/dashaka44.html> )
