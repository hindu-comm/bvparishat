Garga Muni himself has explained the meaning of Krishna Aksharakramena in his book Garga Samhita.  
  
Shlok starts as कशब्दो कमलाकान्तः।  
I will post the shlokas after finding them.  
  
And also, I'm not aware scientifically if it's true or not, but does Black colour absorb stuff or light? Krisha vilekhane means to absorb or pull towards yourself. I think Black colour absorbs all colours hence due to it's absorbing nature it is also called Krishna?  
  
Another thing, Black is also the colour of Kaama. Krishna is not Black like Hiranyakashipu. He's Bhaswara Black, Ghanashyamavapuh. He has a glow, a lusture in him which attracts everyone. He's attraction to all Gopis and Vrajabhaktas.  
  
Also, in Bhagawat Purana Garga pressures on the Leela-Nityatva of Hari by uttering, "bahUni santi nAmAni rUpANi cha sutasya te."  
The word santi is to be observed. Bhavishyanti should have been much correct for he hasn't picked up the mountain yet to be called Giridhara or hasn't yet killed Mura to be known as Murari etc.  
  
Still santi proves that his Leela is eternal, spread in all three times or is not bound to time at all!
