the speech signal is in TIME domain and is usually a mix of several harmonics and other frequencies.

The FOURIER transforms the digitised signal into frequency domain and thus making it better suited for isolating the various frequencies and study the "formants" after isolating the frequencies/harmonics.

  

I hope this helps.
