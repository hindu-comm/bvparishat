Respected Scholars, Namaskar!

My concept and research on VarNavaada is based on properties of consonants as listed in Sanskrit VarNamaalaa. I arrived at this conclusion only after studying the spectral analysis of consonants and vowels of Sanskrit. Beauty of Sanskrit is in semantics of Sanskrit shabdas. However some scholars interested more in Roopasiddhi which is external Alankaara of Bhaas'aa. I do not believe in Sphotavada of later day grammarians. Thanks. NRJOSHI
