Namaste Bharat Chandra Dasa,

  

The best options would be to ask the website to take them of the server. You need to be the copy write holder. Normall publishers hold the copy-write and they act for violation. Please note author consent will not be required if the rights are with the publisher. If the website is an Indian web site then you can consult your lawyer.

This is my opinion an Arthur writes for a book to be read. How much revenue loss has accrued on account of your book being available for a free download. What is the scan quality. of the upload.  

  

Regards

Ajit Gargeshwari
