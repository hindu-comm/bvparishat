Sir,

  

Since the website owners are not responding to your request, you may write to Google to remove the links from their search results.

I am sure there would be other ways of handling this issue, like reporting to the companies that host these websites. But it requires expertise to identify the hosting companies and to find out their contact details. I hope someone from BVP will guide you.  

  

regards  
shankara
