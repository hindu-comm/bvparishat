Dear Vidvatjanah

  

Namaste,

  

I had published a book in 2013 and the work on its second edition is ongoing currently. I was surprised when it came to my notice that the whole book has been scanned and put for download on two websites without my permission as the author nor my trust as the publisher!

  

Even after writing to them there has been no response.

  

This is a very sad situation and I seek guidance and suggestions. I spent 2 years of hard work compiling that book. Please let know what is the best course of action in this matter.

  

Dasosmi,

Bharat Chandra Dasa
