Dear Scholars,

  

I would suggest that the way of looking at Sanskrit grammar needs to change. The conception of the Ashtadhyayi by Pan ini is in no way like the way in which the grammarians in the west conceived the grammars of their language. If the Pratishakhyas are viewed as a process that started from a sentence, a vedic rucha, then to a pada and finally to individual letters then the Maheshwar Sutras can be seen as the periodic table of elements and the Ashtaadhyayi as the technology of forming molecules (consonant + vowel) from the basic elements to the formation of compounds (words) further to the formation of complex compounds (organic compounds) that are useful in day to day life (the sentence).

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
