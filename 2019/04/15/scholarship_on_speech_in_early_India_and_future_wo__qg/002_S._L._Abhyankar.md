नमस्ते श्रीमन् बिजोय्-मिश्र-वर्य !

It comes to mind that ancient Indian "scholarship about speech" is evident,

  

\(A\) first of all

in putting all the vowels together in one sequence and

grouping all consonants in seven groups -

-   first five groups by place of emanation, the पञ्चवर्ग-s - क्, च्,
    ट्, त्, प्
-   another sixth group of semi-vowels or अन्तस्थ-s - ह्, य्, व्, र्, ल्
    from शिवसूत्र-s #5 and #6
-   the seventh group of ऊष्म-s - श् ष् स् as in शिवसूत्र #13

\(B\) If "scholarship about speech" should also include devising the scripts, there is scholarship, also in the fact that all Indian scripts are phonetic. (What the sound of a letter is, that is also the name of the letter).

The word "Indian" here should cover geographically, all the Indian sub-continent, including those areas in Pakistan, and maybe, Afghanistan, where script such as Kharoshti (some interesting details here \<<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharosthi>\>) prevailed.

It comes to mind that this name of the script खरोष्ठी may have an etymology as खर्-ओष्ठी - scripting all those sounds, which emanate (starting) from the throat (including or up to) the lips.or

-   खर् meaning अक्षर and ओष्ठी meaning the mouth

I am left wondering, why the linguistics of Greek Roman Latin evolved with sequence of alpha, beta, gyamma, etc. with such confused mix-up of vowels and consonants. Surprisingly, this concept spread also into Arabic अलिफ् बे पे ते, It spread even into Russian extents. That makes a very vast geographical extent !  

  

Does this also nail down the Aryan Invasion theory ? The "scholarship about speech" seems to be definitely, wholly, solely, INDIAN.

  

Recently I came across an instance of how to pronounce a German poem. It was a pleasant experience, that by scripting the poem in देवनागरी it becomes so much straightforward to replicate the German speech.

**गोल्द् माख्त् निश्त् येदेन् राइश्**

**गोल्द् इश्त् गेश्मायदिश् उण्ट् वाइश् - वी आइन् लुर्श्**

**श्लेङ्ग्त् झिश् छ्विशन् देन् फिङ्गर्न् दुर्श्**

**गोल्द् एन्त्रोल्त् फोन् गोत् गेवोल्त्**

**गोल्द् झोल् निश्त् फ्रेश् झाइन्**

**गोल्द् दार्फ् निश्त् ब्लेश् झाइन्**

**निश्त् दुर्श्-मेस्सिङ्ग्त् ओदर् दुर्श्-झिल्बर्त्**

**गोल्द् विल् रेद्-लिश् फ्रै झाइन् - ओह्न औफ्-गेछुङ्ग्-नेस् बै-झाइन्**

**ह्योरन् झी गिल्बर्त् ?**

**गोल्द् माख्त् उन्स् त्रुङ्केन्**

**गोल्द् स्तिङ्क्त् आल्स् हालुङ्केन्सोल्द्**

**गोल्द् माख्त् निश्त् गुत्**

**गोल्द् वितेर्त् ब्लुत्**

**गोल्द् माख्त् निश्त् फ्रोह्**

  

It should be interesting to note that ending sounds of most German words are just consonants, (without addition of any vowel-sound). I thought it good to script them as such.

In all the above scripting, there are only three words with vowel-ending**फ्रै,ओह्न**and**झी**
