Dear friends,

Good morning.

As you may notice through my postings, I have been deeply impressed by the  

scientific approach of the old Indian scholars particularly in language and communication.

It is possible also in Mathematics, but I am just preparing to study them.

Scientific approach is a phrase, which has the inner specification to differentiate

between what is perceived and what errors might exist. To find our own errors  

is a built-in handicap in human make up and we operate through our assumed  

universe. Through a time process, Indian scholars established that all knowledge

at any time is only an approximation and is a step towards finding the complete

knowledge. More we discover, more remains to be known.

This tacit understanding of our sensory limitations, to my thinking, is the most brilliant

contribution of Indian scholars to the field of knowledge. Once accepted, it reduces us  

to be pedestrian travelers in a search letting us accept the glory of knowledge with an

admiration for the path that we even can walk. The path itself limits us to look at the

ground and to develop the next step from the step we are on the ground.
I have not  

researched how the process of editing or argumentation was practiced.
But it could be

that a researcher merits a qualification through training and a commitment before starting

to walk. This last part was strongly violated with the development of modern Indology,

where the assumption is that knowledge is waiting to be created by observation and  

not to be discovered through cultivation and analysis.  

Scientific analysis of perceived objects is physics, but the scientific analysis of the  

universe is philosophy. Physics gives us a working model and we become good engineers.

Philosophy lets us understand the universe starting with our own self as an object. In Physics,

we observe the universe and satisfy ourselves with practical understanding. In philosophy

we get into the fundamental understanding which would elude us because we are unable to

assimilate the universe by being a part of the universe.

I do not know who enunciated this dichotomy, but I noticed first in Brhadaranyaka Upanisad

and then saw the brilliant analysis by Bhratrhari. Speech is an area where this process  

of cosmos and the individual can be experimented and the differentiation can be appreciated.

I wish to encourage all language researchers to give time to study the magnificent Vakyapadiyam which can be done in two years through a concentrated group study.

It may take a few more years to appreciate the concepts fully. The latter is a slow

process but is done internally where we don't need equipment or laboratory. The physics of

speech is within us and is for us to to discover. Let the past scholars guide us if they

think we have the motivation and qualification. It is their search, we offer to walk on a path

carved by them.

Best regards,

BIjoy Misra
