Sir Lokesh

  

Just like the famous gayatri mantra of Savita, तत्सवितुर्वरेण्यम् ..., there are other Gayatri mantras for other Gods. The peculiar features of these mantras are:

  a. The words vidmahe, dhImahi and tat naH pracodayAt are included

  b. The deity is in caturthI vibhakti in the first two instances (tatpurushAya and mahadevAya in the example given below) even though the verb forms vidmahe and dhImahi do not require that

  

For instance, the Rudragayatri is तत्पुरुषाय विद्महे महादेवाय धीमहि तन्नो रुद्रः प्रचोदयात्। These are there in the link given Sri Shankara. The one quoted by you seems to be the Prakrit version of a similar mantra (with the two peculiar features noted above), with the Jain munis as the devata. The Sanskrit version of that would as follows:

  

सर्वमुनये विद्महे विश्वजनाय धीमहि तन्नः क्षेमं प्रचोदयात्।

  

Going by the tradition of Gayatri mantras of this type, sarvamuni, visvajana and kshemam should refer to the same deity. In this case, the intent could be that the munis reside in all janas and cause the well-being of all. So a literal translation would be:

  

I understand the sarvamuni (all munis); I meditate upon the visvajana (all people); may that Kshemam (one who causes the well-being?) awaken / enlighten us.

  

Someone who knows the Jain tradition could fix the meaning better. Regarding the Prakrit version, I didn't work with ardhamAgadhi (the Prakrit preferred in Jainism) till now and so am unable to give that version.
