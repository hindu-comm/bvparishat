Thanks Mr Sivasennai. Based on your feedback and some more research I could come up with this meaning-

OM let us contemplate She, the skull like; let us think of She that gives birth to the universe, let us point towards, pray to Kalimata

  

It seems like Tantric Gayatri mantra for Kali Devi, as you were alluding, partly.

  

Do you think that is close enough?

  

Thanks,

Lokesh
