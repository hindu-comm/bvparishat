I have sung this umpteen number of times during Aashtmi since my childhood as part of "mala-jap."

I would appreciate if someone could shed light on the source and meaning of this-

"Sarvamunyei Widmai Visvanjyei Dhemai Tanna Klemnam Prachodayat"  

This has been primarily through listening alone so please pardon me if there is a mistake in getting it exact.

  

-Lokesh
