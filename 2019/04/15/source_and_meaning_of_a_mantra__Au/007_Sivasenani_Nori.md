Sri Lokesh

  

I understand that this is something personal for you, and would hesitate to contradict your exploration, especially not knowing the background. Still, given the text, the interpretation offered by you seems inappropriate. Kshemam being replaced by Kali is tenable, but not the rest of the assumptions (about the skull-like and she that gives birth to the universe). I would also like to clarify that it was not my intent to allude to the Tantric Kali Gayatri. Tantric mantras are in Sanskrit; the one cited by you is in Prakrit. The use of Prakrit and the occurrence of muni is what led me to believe that this could be a Jain mantra.

N. Siva Senani
