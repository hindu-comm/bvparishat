Namaste,

  

I understand well that this subject can be of interest to very few people. So, I would like to share with these few the results of a 10-day investigation, which also included a trip to Ganeshpuri, Maharashtra. I’ve gathered information from different sources and now the picture is becoming more or less clear.

  

I sent an fb message to Gautam Chatterjee, and he immediately (no wonder!) admitted that the translation belonged to Dr. B. N. Pandit and that Dilip Kumar (owner of the "Indica Books") gave it to him, allegedly, with a request to edit it(??). So at least we don't have to prove the authorship of the translation anymore. The "translator" himself admitted that he was not a translator))

  

Here it is necessary to make clear that Ganeshpuri is the location of "Muktabodha" Indological Research Institute branch. Dr. B.N. Pandit had a contract with that institute as a translator of both Tantrasara and Tantraloka. Muktabodha, in turn, had a contract with the “Indica Books” regarding the publication of Dr. Pandit’s translation of Tantrasara. Professor Tripathi was expected to write the preface, and professor Mishra was supposed to be an editor.

  

Under what circumstances the translation ended up in Mr. Gautam's hands, and why his name was printed on the cover of the book as editor of the first edition and translator of the second, remains a mystery. And we can no longer get an explanation from the recently deceased Mr. Dilip Kumar, except through a session of spiritualism. So we are only left with a hope that other living owners of "Indica Books" and "Indian mind" can somehow clarify this issue.

  

Another serious question is why after this mistake (or rather a crime) while some of the participants knew very well who the real author of the translation was, why were they silent?? Wasn’t it possible to make a public announcement, a newspaper article, at least a post in social networks? Or the publisher could withdraw the printed copies from the sale and paste a sticker with the correct author's name on each copy of the publication. It doesn’t cost much. But instead of these simple and logical actions silence for 4 years! The mysterious Indian soul, or “Indian mind”?

  

When I asked Mr. Gautam why he was silent and is still silent, he is just ignoring my questions. He was not willing at all to assist in the investigation, even to provide the necessary contacts, I had to look for them myself. It seems that when he realised that he could get away with the first edition in 2015, that no one protested and challenged his authorship, he decided to have no problem putting his name as a translator on the second edition. And then suddenly, the deception was revealed just 2 weeks ago. In any case, one fact is clear: a completely innocent person would do anything to help restore justice, especially now when the fraud has been detected and publicly announced. The same "author" published his absolutely terrible (as Mark Dyczkowski and other scholars know) "translation" of Tantraloka, most likely, according to Mark, copied from some Hindi translation. So, his name and fame are well established now with these two "translations" of very profound and difficult for understanding texts of Trika, aren't they? If you look at his FB pages (he has many), you will see that he positions himself as a highly spiritually advanced person, a scholar, poet, expert in Kashmir Shaiva darshana, film maker and what not.

  

So, we have two lawsuits here - from the side of B.N. Pandit's family and from the side of "Muktabodha" because they had a contract with the publisher which was violated too. The fraud is much aggravated by the fact that it went against a renowned honourable scholar and sadhaka - Dr.B.N.Pandit Ji whose contribution to the studies of Trika darshana is priceless. He is now too far away, it is unlikely that this story matters to him, but it is important for Shaiva Sangha, for the academic community and for anyone who still manages to live by the concepts of Honour.
