The list is deteriorating into personal attacks. and generalizations.
I would request all to bring up scholarly issues without  

getting into the personalities. Our list has the Bharatiya in its title. This includes a larger view that an error is criticized

but not the person. A tacit humility in all accusations is built into the phrase. "An error appears to have been done" is different

than "an error is done." Hope all would appreciate and use restraint.
