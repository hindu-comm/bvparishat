Mārcis : It is rather shameful to say the least. and has been adequately captured in the above Amazon customer review. While I appreciate your anger and outrage and reflect the same, I take exception to your comment: "The mysterious Indian soul, or “Indian mind”?"--> When you have clearly identified the offending party(s) concerned, where is the need to generalise and tar the rest of Indians with that blame?

  

Venkatesh: What are you trying to prove here? That plagiarism is wide spread in India and that it is a "way of life" in Indian academia? Sorry to disappoint you. That is not the case.

And how did you conclude that Purandara dasa did not actually compose all those songs? Does this come from the adage "if I cannot do it, no one else possibly can" ?

  

By those standards maybe Michael Phelps or Usain Bolt are not real people and the product of creative CGI and mass media marketing to sell Nike and Speedo to us unwashed masses. Special people do exist and it is in acknowledging the same that the rest of us can improve by adopting their discipline and process. "Yad yad acharati sreshtah.."

  

Kindly keep your comments pertinent to the topic on hand and avoid broad stroked generalisations about people.

  

I have had the misfortune of presenting papers and having people come in just to sign their name alongside mine without having put in any work whatsoever in Australian universities. And this was from mostly caucasians who were well-heeled, postgrads and working in fortune 500 companies. When I represented the same to my lecturer, I was told to ignore and look the other way.

  

Isaac Newton stole the work of Leibniz and put his name over Joseph Raphson's results.

Pythagoras has his name on Brahmagupta's results.

There is a simmering controversy on whether Einstein stole "Relativity" from his first wife Mileva.

  

Plagiarism is a world problem. Kindly refrain from brown-washing it. 

  

Kind Regards,

  

Venkat
