Namaste

  

True. See -

  

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_plagiarism_in_India>

  

'Upon enquiry a Committee, based on a report by a student, found that the book *Quantitative Techniques for Managerial Decisions* by U. K. Srivastava, G. V. Shenoy, and S. C. Sharma had copied without acknowledgment of the source at least at 10 different places including 5 foreign books and some other Indian books, such as Baumol, Levin and Wagner (all books were published prior to the publication of the book).'  

  

Reverse is also true. Many Indian authors have contributed to another person's writing without getting any recognition. Famous examples are found in Purandara Dasa's songs in Kannada. There are so many songs. He could not have written all of them. Some other people have written many songs and put his name. They are not identifiable now. I don't know of any name for this. This is reverse plagiarism.
