The translation of an idea to acoustics carries intonation, intensity

ans duration of the signal. I used the word "intent" in the previous

thread. The hearing of words also needs "intent" to perceive.

When we read, the "acoustic nature" gets flattened. Hence  

concentrated syllabic recitation is a necessity in unraveling a

composition. The meaning is cognitive and is realized.

In cognition, we are our only reference, no books or other objects.

In our paper we connect this to the psycho-physical quantity "bhAva".
