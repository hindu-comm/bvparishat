Pranam to all learned scholars,

  

These days I am reading अध्यात्मरामायण, and Ram tells Vishvamitra "दीक्षां प्रविश्यताम्" (Balkanda, Sarga 5).

  

1\. Does this mean that each time a yajna is to be performed, the karta has to take diksha? Can diksha be taken by oneself, if not who may have administered diksha to Vishvamitra?

2. Which books lay down the rituals for "entering into diksha"?

  

विदुषाम् अनुचरः

प्रकाशः
