Dear Krishna Kashyap Ji,

  

  I have privately sent to you the pdf of Professor Mainkar's book and the pdf of Arvind Sharma's book *The Hindu Gītā* that discusses the interpretations of the Bhagavadgītā by various commentators. Because of the size of the pdfs, I cannot send them as attachments to the BVP.
