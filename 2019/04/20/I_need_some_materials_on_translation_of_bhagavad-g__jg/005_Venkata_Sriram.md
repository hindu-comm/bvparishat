Namaste,

  

Hope you are good at sanskrit and studied BG under teacher. My teacher used to insist that one should always study the original in sanskrit.

  

Bhagavat Gita, though '**seemingly simple**', is considered to be the toughest book among prasthAna-traya. That is why, it is taught at the end in Sringeri by Mahasannidhanam to eligible students after completion Brahma Sutra and a few Upanishads.

  

Otherwise, if you want to study it academically without getting into hair-splitting discussions of various 'isms', then Gita Press edition with Goendka / Ramasukh Das Ji is wonderful that goes straight into the heart.

  

That said, there are a few words that have been twisted by Gita Press edition also which I came to know later when I started learning under sanskrit scholar.

  

So, knowledge of sanskrit coupled with study under a good teacher hailing from traditional background is of immense help. I see that english translations are horrible with meanings of words twisted and murdered.

  

rgs,

sriram
