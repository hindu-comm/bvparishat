namaskar

  

I already have the access to Gita supersite etc.

I know there are lots of text books. I have several of them. I am looking for English translations, presentations, summaries of Gita bhashyas of mainly Shankaracharya, Ramanujacharya and Madhvacharya. which are free and downloadable. I can cut and paste to create materials from them. I already have alladi mahadeva sastri shankarabhashya.

Are there any simple summary like works on Gita bhashyas?. just original works explained well in English. Someone may have created good power points, teaching materials etc.. Just getting as much info as possible.

  

I am teaching a course on Gita and easy summaries created by some people may provide more insights and easy information for students. Even though I teach, I am actually a beginner. Just want to learn more so that I can teach. The problem is I have so little time to prepare before a class! Good materials in English will help.
