Respected Scholars,

Is any transcription of Jayadrathayamala, the early Sakta text from Trika Vidyapitha tradition, available? TheNepal-German Manuscript Preservation Project seems to have stopped reproducing the copies of scans. The Muktabodha library under Dr. Dyczkowski declaredpublication of the text about 10 years ago and even published the first part, but it has removed all such texts. Is it available from any sources?

Regards,
