Namaste,

  

recently I was going over Dr. VS Agarwala's translation and commentary on Devi Mahatmiyam. This has not been discussed much like some of his other works.  

  

A non-profit organization would like republish this out-of-print book or at least some parts of it. Is there a way to reach out to the publisher of this book: All India Kasi Raj Trust, Varanasi? Could any of the members provide a reliable contact information for this Trust? I see their presence on the web in news but not as a webpage.  

  

Any help on this woudl be greatly appreciated.

  

thanks
