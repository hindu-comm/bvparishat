I think,this book is in Hindi also and you may get the details of the publisher etc.therefrom too.

  

Smt.Krishnaji,the daughter of the Kashinaresh,could be contacted personally at her residence or office of the Kashiraj Trust.

  

Best of luck in your sincere efforts,because,that book by Dr. Aggarwal is not much known or studied,though it is one of the best books on the DM.,as he has given a very novel perspective,that also,so many years ago.
