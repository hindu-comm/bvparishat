Dear Subhankar Das,

  

You may organize your study into the following sub-topics:

  

1\. 12th Chapter dedicated to what is called as "Bhakti Yoga"

  

2\. Use of the word Bhakti in the other chapters than 12th , context and purpose.

  

3\. Relative position of BhaktiYoga in relation to the other Yogas in the book.

  

4\. Various Schools of Vedanta and how they look at Bhakti in their understanding of AshTaadas'aadhyaayee :

  

      1. Sankara's and other Advaita commentaries of Gita, their analysis of the 12th Chapter and the occurrence of the word Bhakti in other chapters

      2. Bhakti schools of Vedanta : Various commentaries such as Madhvacharya's Ramanujacharya's etc. from the point of view of their respective schools

  

            a.Do Bhakti schools bring Bhakti-significance in chapters other than the 12th, if yes, how, if no , why ?

  

            b. In what way Bhakti schools deal with the 12th Chapter ? In what way do they deal with the other occurrences of the word Bhakti?

  

5\. Is the general understanding of Bhakti among common people and in general use of the term/concept different from the way it is used in AshTaadas'aadhyaayee ?
