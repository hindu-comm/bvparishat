No, the quotation you have given is a different one.

kauTalya does use in one of the early chapters this expression :  

***vRddhasya tIrthes"u pratipAdanI.***

(The idea is not much different from that of your quote, though).

BVK misquotes and misgrasps, and accordingly mistranslates  

(even where, that is, he thinks he is translating properly).

He is fond of fun.
