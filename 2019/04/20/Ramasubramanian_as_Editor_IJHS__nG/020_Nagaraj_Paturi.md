Respectful congratulations to Prof. Ramasubramanian. Best selection.

  

Prof. Ramasubramanian contributed a lot already in his areas of Mathematics, Astronomy etc.

  

We are badly in need of decolonisation of the field of History of Science.

  

This selection is highly promising in that direction.
