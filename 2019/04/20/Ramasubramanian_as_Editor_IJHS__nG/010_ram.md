श्रद्धास्पदेषु,

महत्या प्रीत्या अभिमानेन च शुभाशयवचांसि व्याहृतवद्भ्यः (व्वाहरिष्यमाणेभ्यश्च ?) हार्दिकधन्यवादान् व्याजिहीर्षामि ।

Btw, I thoroughly enjoyed reading the verse cited in the connection and its interpretations, as well as interpretations of the interpreter. ...

I liked the verse so much as it brilliantly summarizes what a scholar should aspire and what he should do towards fulfilling his aspirations. Thanks a lot to Venkata Sriram. May I know the source of it?
