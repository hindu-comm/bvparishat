Namaste



Congratulations and best wishes to Prof. Ramasubramanian ji.



The action on wisdom-statement of Chanakya : ' Qualified Senior person should be posiitoned at the right place of authority and executive chair' ( vruddham teertheshu nikshipet) - seems to have begun.



( And MISTRANSLATION of this wise statement could be: The old person should be drowned at the holy waters ! )
