प्रिय मित्रवर्य,

I know that you were a brilliant scholar in Vyakarana, and have had several occasions (when I used to participate in Vaakyarthasadas) to admire your scholarship, as well as sharp-wit in responding to questions.  

The verse that you have composed undoubtedly portrays your outstanding skills as a poet too. I was thrilled to read this verse, filled with both शब्द and अर्थालङ्कार ।

With deep admiration and respect for your profound scholarship!

Best regards,

-ram.
