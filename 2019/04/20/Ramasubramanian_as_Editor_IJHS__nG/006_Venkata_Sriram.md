Namaste Sastry Ji,

  

I think by mistake, you have misquoted. The right one would be:

  

...............

# अलब्धं चैव लिप्सेत लब्धं रक्षेत्प्रयत्नतः । रक्षितं वर्धयेच्चैव **वृद्धं पात्रेषु निक्षिपेत्** ।

...............

  

BTW, congratulations to Prof.Rama ji...the honour is well-deserved.

  

rgs,

sriram
