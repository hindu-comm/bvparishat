Dear Colleagues,

  

  I found an old 2010 agreement that was signed between the University of Michigan and someone named Jiri Holba at the Charles University in Prague regarding publishing a Czech translation of my Saṃskr̥ta-Subodhinī: A Sanskrit Primer. Neither I nor anyone at the University of Michigan ever heard again from this individual and I have not seen such a translation. Has anyone come across a Czech translation of my book? If you have, can you please send me details of this publication? Thanks for any assistance. This question has come up since someone at the University of Michigan found this old agreement and wrote to me asking if anything further developed.
