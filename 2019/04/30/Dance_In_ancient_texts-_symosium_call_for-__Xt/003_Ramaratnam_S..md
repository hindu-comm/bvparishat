Respected Professor,

Namaste. I wish to introduce myself as the Vice Chancellor of Jagadguru Kripalu University, Odisha, India. I have nearly 50 years of experience in the field of Sanskrit literature, Indian Philosophy and allied subjects. Please refer to my website at [www.ratnam.weebly.com](http://www.ratnam.weebly.com) for an account of my qualification, experience, conferences attended, research experience, books and articles published etc. I am usually invited to preside over conferences, render inaugural address/ Keynote address, valedictory address or a special address. I have given such addresses in Hamburg, Leiden, Amsterdam, Vienna, Melbourne, Durban, Houston, Xian, Singapore, Bangkok, Vancouver, Colombo and several other places in the world. Should you require my services (as a Keynote speaker etc) for your conference in this respect, please get in touch with me. I am attaching my CV for your reference. I am also attaching an abstract and the full paper for the symposium.  

With regards,

ramaratnam
