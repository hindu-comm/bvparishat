**The A of ABC of Indian chronology: Dimensions of the Aryan problem revisited in 2017**  

***  
***

***Abstract:***Whether posited as an invasion by or migration of Aryans, these variant forms—of an into-India hypothesis (supposed movement into India around the second millennium BCE)—are underpinned by one constant: the consequence that the earliest forms of Vedic culture and Sanskrit are not indigenous to India. Written in 2017, this paper examines, in three dimensions, whether such a hypothesis, given its startling consequence to Indic history, can remain a preserve of only one domain (linguistics) before demonstrating not only an absence of proof for such a consequence, amongst other related questions, in key Indic texts through a study of the terms ārya and drāviḍa but also specific problematics in the development of this hypothesis in historical linguistics.

***Excerpts from review comments received***:

  

**Dr. Korada Subrahmanyam**: "...both of you contributed a great deal of knowledge to many people, especially from the field of Linguistics, who have been of the view that it is the Western Linguists that deserve the appreciation for analyzing Language at both micro and macro levels.The books chosen by you and the points you selected to refute - in fact bring out the truth - with regard to Language Science - is commendable.

We require more such Articles simply because we want to kill the inferiority complex of Indians thru the pen and open the treasure trove of knowledge that has been lying unattended for centuries. Hope you guide/encourage others also in this path ."

  

**Dr. Subhash Kak:**"Enjoyed reading your article. Very well argued."
