I read the paper. I am not an expert in the subject. But I can see that it is a very systematic attempt to bring out philological data about Saraswati River.

  

I have one suggestion - (of course critical edition is valuable) - But for historical studies - Especially on River Sarasvati - please consider to consult the northern Recensions of Mahabharata. It may provide some vital clue. This is my guess.  

  

In this context I have a question - Which recension has influenced the BORI critical edition the most - northern or southern or any other recension.
