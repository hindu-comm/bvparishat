The late Padmashri Dr.Vishnu Shridhar alias Haribhau Wakankar of Ujjain,a world.famous archaeologist, successfully tracked the path of the Lost Sarasvati River and that material was partially published from Pune.

  

It seems many modern scholars are not able to read or appreciate that valid research based on archaeology and assisted by many scholars from different fields.

  

The interested may benefit by studying that material.

  

It seems that Dr.Kalyanaraman or Kalyanasundaram of Chennai has written some papers based on some of that material.

  

Best luck in our and your efforts to know the truth.

  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
