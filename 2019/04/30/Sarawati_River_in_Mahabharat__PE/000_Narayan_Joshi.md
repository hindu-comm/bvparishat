Respected Scholars, Namaskar!

Thereare Saraswati River and Oghavati river in Afghanistan.There is Saraswati Sangama in Afghanistan. Madras, Vahlikas and Stree Rajya of Mahabharata were outside of the India and Pakistan. The ancient name of Croasia was H'Rat that is Harahati. River names in Lithuania are Indian river names. With expanded vision ancient history is much more Interesting. Thanks. N.R.Joshi
