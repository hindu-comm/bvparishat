Vedic sarasvati

Rigved and yajurveda refers saraswati, post Vedic era or Mahabharata era says this with little change of name

Jain and baudha era are little silent about Vedic river,

Unfortunately we are missing midival history of jio socio political , so follow Al biruni or westerners and we don't know actually what was the reason that Vedic sarasvati river lost thy flow full of glory, some Pandits tried out to map up Vedic sarasvati, I will remember विद्या वाचस्पति स्व. के. का. शास्त्राणि who published a book on Vedic saraswati during the time of modiji as CM of Gujarat, I also will add ISRO researcher thakkar sahib who used satellite images to confine path of Vedic sarasvati from himalay to prabhas,
