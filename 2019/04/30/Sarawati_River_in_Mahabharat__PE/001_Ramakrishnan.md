Yes, Afghanistan (including adarsha, the place where the Sarasvati river disappears in the sand) is the westernmost limit of the Vedic civilization (Aryavarta) as per dharmashastra texts. This adarsha (the place where the current Helmand river disappears) is also exactly on the the current southwestern border of Afghanistan.

  

The current northern border of Afghanistan is theवक्षु (Oxus) river. Theवक्षु is also a well known river in the Vedic and early classical sanskrit literature.

  

The borders of the current republic of India does not include the entire aryavarta of the vedic era.So we need to give more importance to Afghanistan as we might find more tangible finds of early Indian civilization from there if we start looking more seriously.

  

Regards,

Ram
