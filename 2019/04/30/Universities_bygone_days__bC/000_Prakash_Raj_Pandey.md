Pranam to all learned scholars,

  

I just came across this link which talks about universities:

<https://detechter.com/8-ancient-universities-that-flourished-across-ancient-india/>

  

The word विश्विद्यालय is regarded as a new one coined to translate the concept of "university" in the Indian languages.

  

If that is so, by what name where is ancient universities known when these universities were in existence?

  

विदुषाम् अनुचरः
