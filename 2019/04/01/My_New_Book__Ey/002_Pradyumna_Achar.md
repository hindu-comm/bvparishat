सादरम् वन्दनानि \|

Back in 2008, my Father had written an English translation of IsaavaasyaUpanishad, with English translations of Sri Shankaracharya and Sri Madhvaacharya

The book is available in [archive.org](http://archive.org) at<https://archive.org/details/IsaavaasyaUpanishat/page/n1>

Part 1 contains his English translation.

Part 2 contains the two commentaries (advaita and dwaita) along with the English translations of the commentaries.

Regards,

-Pradyumna
