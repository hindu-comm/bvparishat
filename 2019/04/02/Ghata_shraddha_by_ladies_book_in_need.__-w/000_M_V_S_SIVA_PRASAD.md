Respected scholars ,  
I request a book which deals with the ghata shraddha vidhi by women is in need.  
Along with the pramana in dharma sastra.  
It's required for the personal use of some known person whose daughter left his husband due to lunatic nature and illegal affairs. She is requested for second marriage so in order to break previous relations with the husband according to dharma sastra they want to perform ghata shraddha .  
SO IAM requesting the group members to give the link or details of the book which deals with the ghata sraddha along with the references of dharmasastra.  
Thank you.
