Nagaraj ji,

  

This is great.

  

However for all the journals and research papers published in India, and those published abroad which are public domain, we need to have our own online jstor-like online system to access them because not all Indian published sources are available on jstor.

  

Maybe this is a project Indic Academy can explore going forward.

  

Ramakrishnan.
