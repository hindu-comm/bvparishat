Learned friends,

  

Here is my book 'The Yogavasishtha of Valmiki'. It is about Advaita Vedanta. The original is very huge and has about 24,000 shlokas approx. This book deals with essential sidhantas of Advaita Vedanta in about 400 pages. I wrote it under the guidance of my guru Prof Dharmanand Sharma Dimri, Panjab University.

  

Here is the Amazon link

Hari Om.
