As you know,it is very difficult to get an honest publisher, as vouchsafed by Lokamanya Bal Gangadhar Tilak and Pt.Jawaharlal Nehru,when they experienced unusual behaviour of their publishers,who looked more to their business than the scholarship of the authors.

  

Best luck in your sincere efforts.  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
