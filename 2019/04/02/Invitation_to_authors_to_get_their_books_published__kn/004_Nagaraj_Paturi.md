Thank you sir, for your blessings.

  

"in encouraging the scholars to get their books published by an agency of real scholars and not owned by businessmen."

  

-that is the actual objective of this program.

  

To see to it that the authors, not the businessmen get benefited while reaching out to their target audience in a big way. This is a non-profit activity , a social entrepreneurship.

  

Hope it will achieve its objectives.
