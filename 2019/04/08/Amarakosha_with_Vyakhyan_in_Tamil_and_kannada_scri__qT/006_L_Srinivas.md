For those who may be interested, there's a recent publication of the Amara in Tamil issued in the Thanjavur Saraswathi Mahal Series - 2006, with, I think, a reprint in 2014. t does not have any commentaries but it does have the original verse in Devanagari and Tamil, with synonyms in Tamil for all the entries. There are some entries, especially those concerning flora and fauna, where it has descriptive explanations in the absence of synonyms. It comes in 3 volumes. I couldn't work the search facility in the Saraswathi Mahal website so I'm not able to give a link.

  

Since Telugu was mentioned, there is also an earlier work by one Pandit Thiruvenkatachari in Tamil on the Amarakosa which I have seen long time back. This has a commentary in Tamil which is said to be an adaptation of a Telugu work by one Lingayyasuri (?). I dont have further details but this work may not be very useful to students now as the Sanskrit, I remember, was in Grantha characters. I dont know if [archive.org](http://archive.org) or any of these other sites have it.  

  

  

Thanks,

  
Srini
