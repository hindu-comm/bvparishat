Respected scholars my friend Marella keerti chandra is giving the Amarakosha classes in whatsapp group in both sanskrit and telugu languages. Some group members shown interest to translate his classes in tamil and kannada too. Hence two new groups are also created for their comfort. But the e.books of amarakosa with vyakhyan are not available for me to forward to the translators. So I request the members to forward me the links of websites where the Amarakosa with vyakhya is available in Tamizh and Kannada Languages. We are following GURUBALA PRABODHIKA for both the telugu and sanskrit vyakhya. If Guru Bala Prabodhika available in Tamizh and Kannada as ebook please provide those links also.  
  
Thank you
