Namaste to all here!

  

I know that the nameहरिrefers to Lord Vishnu, but what exactly does it mean?

Also, I know that both Narasimha and Hanuman have been calledहरीश्वर which seems to suggest to me thatहरि could be both lion and monkey. Can you explain to me how each of this happens?

  

Thank you in advance!
