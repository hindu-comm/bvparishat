Dear Learner Friends ,



After the successful event of Navyanyaya Language and Methodology (Level-0 i.e. Foundation Course) we want to offer Level-1 in which we are going to teach how to build Navyanyaya Language for a precise and ambiguity-free communication. In this level **Navyanyaya-bhasha-pradipa of Maheshachandra Nayaratna** will be taken up for reading line-by-line.



Needless to say, it will be useful for anyone interested in the methods of precise communication including all those who are working in the area of language-technology and machine translation.



We are exploring an appropriate Venue for this.



In the meantime I want to know your suitable time for joining this programme. I wish larger participation. Please let me know your convenient time. Obviously, the convenience of the majority will prevail. Please respond by 15^(th)of this month so that I begin planning it at an early date.

It will be **open to all, even to those who could not join the Zero-level Course**. Within a monthâ€™s time the dvds of the Zero-level will also be available for learning.



With best wishes,

VNJha
