Prof. Jha,  
  
Namaste. Maybe you can partner with Vyoma Labs (<https://sanskritfromhome.in/>) and offer the course videos online?  
  
Online you will have quite a large audience compared to classroom coaching, and it might be very useful to make it available for future learners as well, so your work has multiple times the impact of a classroom workshop.
