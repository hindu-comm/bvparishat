This is a very excellent opportunity. Though light-pollution is a problem, in some major cities in USA, we have access via volunteer-run public viewings to good telescopes at college observatories - the connected hindu lore would need to be independently known.  
  
If there are similar opportunities in the vicinity of bengaLUru, please let me know.  
  
Also kindly continue to advertise such occasions in the future.
