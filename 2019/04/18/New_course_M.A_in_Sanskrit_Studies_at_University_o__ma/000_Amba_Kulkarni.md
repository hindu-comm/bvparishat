Dear list members,

  

Department of Sanskrit Studies starts a new programme M.A. in Sanskrit Studies from 2019-20. The major goal of this programme is to make the students aware of contributions of Ancient India to various disciplines such as astronomy, mathematics, grammar, health sciences, social sciences and Humanities.  
  
The syllabus is designed in such a way that the students are taught the Sanskrit texts in the same traditional manner, but at the same time they are also shown the interface of these knowledge systems with the modern knowledge systems. Thus the students are exposed to the importance and applicability of the knowledge they acquire in the current context. This course will equip them to take up research in inter-disciplinary areas. At the same time they will also be confident enough to derive insights from Indian knowledge systems into their own disciplines.
