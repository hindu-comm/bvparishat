Dear Shri BVK Sastryji,

  

I have seen a fair few veda gurukulas who place accent on sikshaa before commencing the actual adhyayana.

  

This is not just an issue of sikshaa but an issue of maintaining the entire corpus of vedic shishtacharaa that many vidvans like Shri Koradaji talk about regularly. "Modernising" Vedic education with regard to making it "palatable" / "socially acceptable" is worthless without maintaining the original context of this education.

In most evolutionary systems whether cell/human biology or the environment, "form" follows "function".

"function" is the entire corpus of individual action that exists within a certain external context. When both or even one change, form also adapts to the new "function" and it becomes impossible to replicate the standards found in the vedas/ itihasa-puranas.

  

As an example: the tail in humans became the vestigial appendix (ever since humans stopped living on trees?). The "disappearance" of the semi-mythical "soma" can also be attributed to this loss in individual and local context.
