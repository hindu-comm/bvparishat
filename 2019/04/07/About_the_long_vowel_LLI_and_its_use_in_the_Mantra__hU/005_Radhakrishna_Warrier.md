Is this discussion about the vowel ऌ and its longer (dīrgha) counterpart ॡor about the consonant + vowel combination लृ and its dīrgha counterpart लॄ? The first two are counted among vowels and also there is no /r/ sound in their pronunciation. The last two are consonant + vowel combinations (ल् + ऋand ल् + ॠ) with an /r/ sound in their pronunciation.

The short ऌ is present in the word कॢप्त that conveys a sense of limitedness. The tatsama word is used in Malayalam to mean something limited. I don’t know any word in Sanskrit with the long vowel ॡ. Also, I don’t know any Sanskrit word with either लृ or लॄ.

Regards,

Radhakrishna Warrier
