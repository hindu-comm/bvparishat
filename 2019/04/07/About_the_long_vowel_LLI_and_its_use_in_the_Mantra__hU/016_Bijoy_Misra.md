The hypothesis we work with is that all Paninian are parts of human speech and

are scientific. Their manifestation in voice is local and is geography-related.

However I do not know if the Panini set is a complete map of human speech  

to codify independent syllables. Searching the origin of the set through subject  

modeling and tracking the pitch for each syllable are parts of our current work.
