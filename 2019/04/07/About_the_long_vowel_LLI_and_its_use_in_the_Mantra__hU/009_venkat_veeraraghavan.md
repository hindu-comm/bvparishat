Thank you all for your inputs.

  

Dear Shri Madhav ji-

(Although Veeraraghavan is in the place of my surname, it is actually my dad's name and not a family name like say Sharma/ Gokhale... My name is Venkat.. :-)..not having any family names I added my dad's name as the last name.)

Thank you for giving the examples of Tibetan mantras.

  

My issue withॡis not that it is not pronounceable but that many books on grammar explicitly state that there is no long version of theऌvowel. Hence the books suggest that in sandhiऌ+ऌ=ऌunlike say**ऋ+ऋ =ॠ**where 2 short vowels combine to form a long vowel.

  

Although the examples of anusvara followed by visarga that you mention seem irregular (from my very limited knowledge of Sanskrit mantric usage) even they are not unpronounceable...irregular usage may be but not unpronounceable at all.

  

I was therefore confused to see the longer version of that vowel used in the pronunciation guide and also applied as part of the pitha nyasa etc.

  

"It just does not occur in any normal Sanskrit vocabulary. However, as you point out, it is used in Mantra/Tantra texts."

  

Sir: My limited understanding is that the syllabary was developed to describe the world in terms of nama/rupa which is what Tantra seeks to do as well in terms of the nyasas. My confusion stems from the fact that an apparently nonexistent vowel was used, which is not unlike a non existent element's symbol being used in a chemical equaltion. If there are no known words that use the long vowel, why have it at all?

The short vowel although rare is still used as in the chamakam: k(li)ptanchame..

  

Shri Abhyankar ji has mentioned that pronouncing the li sound lru   

"Then I tried to listen to my own pronunciation of लॄ

What I notice is that attempts to pronounceलॄ end up in pronunciation of (ल्+ॠ).

That could be the logic to say thatलॄ does not exist.

Writing tools may provide writing. But if it cannot be pronounced, it does not exist."  

 Shri Abhyankar ji--> I would think the लॄsounds like an elongated (luu) much alike ॠ(ruu).

lruu (ल्+ॠ)does not make sense since a vowel cannot be broken down into a Consonant Vowel pairing.

This however highlights another controversy surrounding the short vowelऌ and its pronunciation. Opinion is divided between lu /li and lru/lri.

Based on many chantings of the chamakam in south India lu/li seems to be winning this controversy.

  

Shri BVK Sastryji:

"Who is ready to be willing partners and supporters , in this venture ? Can we team and work together to focus our energies on regaining the understanding of \<sounds, syllables and words that do occur in normal Sanskrit usage and derivatives of technical language of Pāṇini \>"



-->\> How do you suggest this be achieved? Isn't there an existing model of learning siksha at a veda patashala that addresses precisely this issue?

  

Thank you all!
