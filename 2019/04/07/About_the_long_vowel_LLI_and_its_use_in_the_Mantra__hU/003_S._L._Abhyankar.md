If we go by ऊकालोऽझ्रस्वदीर्घप्लुतः(1-2-27) अचश्च (1-2-28)one cannot deny दीर्घत्वम् for लॄ. "Google input tool" provides typing it as shown. I can also type it using "Sandbox" of Wikipedia, though the वर्ण-s provided there do not have it.

Then I tried to listen to my own pronunciation of लॄ

What I notice is that attempts to pronounceलॄ end up in pronunciation of (ल्+ॠ).

That could be the logic to say thatलॄ does not exist.

Writing tools may provide writing. But if it cannot be pronounced, it does not exist.
