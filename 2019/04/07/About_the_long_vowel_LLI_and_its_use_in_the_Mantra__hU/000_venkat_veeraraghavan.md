Dear Vidvans,

  

Please see attached the relevant section taken from the Mantra Mahodadhi translated by Shri Ram Kumar Rai.

  

As far as I understand the long form of the vowelà¥¡ does not exist as per many Sanskrit greammarians.

  

How is it that this akshara finds its place in the Mantra Mahodadhi but also is used in the text as a part of pitha puja etc.

  

How can a nonexistent akshara be used?

  

Kindly clarify this doubt of mine.

  

Many thanks,

  

Venkat
