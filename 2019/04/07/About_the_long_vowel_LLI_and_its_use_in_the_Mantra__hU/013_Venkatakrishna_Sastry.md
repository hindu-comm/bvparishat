Namaste

On bold part below, i am also looking for people- instituitions beyond book quotes. If you come across please do let me know. Death of Shikshaa shaastra based Samskruth learning is the suspected killer in this case. This needs to be revisited.

On \<Shri BVK Sastryji:

"Who is ready to be willing partners and supporters , in this venture ? Can we team and work together to focus our energies on regaining the understanding of \<sounds, syllables and words that do occur in normal Sanskrit usage and derivatives of technical language of Pāṇini \>"



-->\> ***How do you suggest this be achieved? Isn't there an existing model of learning siksha at a veda patashala that addresses precisely this issue?***

  

Thank you all!
