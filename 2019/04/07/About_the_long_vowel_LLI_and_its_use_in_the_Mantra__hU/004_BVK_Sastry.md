Namaste



Precisely ! \< Prof. Deshpande : My point is simply that sounds, syllables and words that do not occur in normal Sanskrit usage can be found in technical language of Pāṇini and in Tantric syllables etc.> I agree with you.



**'Post colonial academic Sanskrit studies has failed to explore the following (Traditional, practical, even surviving) aspects of Samskruth studies in the Samskruth language applications in religion-rituals ! The most important of this is the ' uccharana': pronunciation fundamentals of the language. Otherwise called as ' shikshaa' base and basics' of Vyakarana'. Not to mention of the greater network of ' Varna-Shaastra (Shikshaa)- Flow (Chandas)- Word Processing (vyakarana)-
Semantics and Meaning unfolding (Nirukta) - Applications by context ( Jyotisha and Kalpa); Rules of Logical evaluation and validation through Vakya and Pramana shastras. In short the ' Shadanga- Vednaga Paddhati of Samskruth studies'. **

****

**The triple whammy in having deviated from traditional norm, accepting
and living with a shortened ' Sanskrit Studies Model' come from the following aspects: (Note: wham·my : (noun, informal)-an event with a powerful and unpleasant effect; a blow;an evil or unlucky influence.). I do acknowledge the good that the colonial studies have brought in creating the awareness of Sanskrit works, the manuscripts preserved and the like, which normally would not have been done in Indian context.
Due credit and appreciation must be given to western scholars and scholars of orient. **

****

**(i) Adaption of 'Romanization (IPA notations ) oriented Script and alien phonetics loaded on Brahmi Varnamaalaa has shifted the core model of Paninian Samskruth studies to be on par with English education. This is the root of several challenges: Both in classical studies of current period and computational Sanskrit linguistics ( which works to program Devanagari Speech and Sentence analysis using English likeness and roman alphabet character set and english grammar logic'. Dr.Narayan Joshi, Achyut Karve have made several observations on this point in 'Shivasutra' related discussions, Varna-Vada and the like).**

****

**(ii) The distinction that existed between 'Samskrutham (vedic and laukika) - Prakrutham- Desi- Apabhramsha- Mleccha' model of Indian Linguistics died out.**

****

**(iii) The new models of Sanskrit-english Dictionaries and ' Translations colored with ' theology- history' motives created enough resentment and negative opinion in Bharath , for the people of Bharath on their native heritage ! ( the goal that was expected from Macaulay education model). The worst hit in this game is 'Sanskrit Language studies'. **

****

**This scenario appears like studying English literature which uses 26 alphabets for word construction with a reduced arbitrary symbols and set of 10 alphabets, using the logic-like of ' alphabets numbers can be progressively increased as the learning progresses' and demand simplification of language studies with a 'reduced alphabets set'. ! Does it ? Contra such study introduces unwarranted distortions and
distractions in what the original text-tradition-practice really meant for ! The ' VINIYOGA' ( = Utility- Application -Benefit part of Samskruth studies , repeatedly stressed in many posts by Dr. Yadu, on this forum) has suffered irreversibly**.



There is no point in playing a blame-shifting game.



Who is ready to be willing partners and supporters , in this venture ?
Can we team and work together to focus our energies on regaining the understanding of \< sounds, syllables and words that do occur in normal Sanskrit usage and derivatives of technical language of Pāṇini \> \<
and used in Tantric syllables etc \> ??
