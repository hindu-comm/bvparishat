To add a footnote to my previous comment, the needs of the technical language exceed the needs of the normal usage of Sanskrit, and the sandhis involving ऌ that would not occur in the normal usage of Sanskrit do occur even in Pāṇini's own sūtras. A good example of this is: ३।१।५५: पुषादिद्युताद्यॢदित: परस्मैपदेषु, where one finds the sandhi द्युतादि+ऌदित:.
