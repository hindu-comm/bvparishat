Dear Venkat Ji,

  

  While I cannot explain why the Tantra works use a long ॡ, it is clear that it does not occur in any normal usage of Sanskrit. On the Śivasūtra ऋऌक्, Patañjali's Mahābhāṣya says that much clearly while questioning the necessity of including ऌ in this Sūtra: अस्य हि ऌकारस्य अल्पीयांश्चैव प्रयोगविषयो यश्चापि प्रयोगविषय: सोऽपि कॢपिस्थस्य कॢपेश्च लत्वमसिद्धम् ... नार्थ ऌकारोपदेशेन. Through the long argument that follows, he mentions possible names like ऌतक taken on by यदृच्छा, or someone's name given as ऋतक being mispronounced as ऌतक through incapacity (अशक्ति) and someone then quoting this mispronunciation (अशक्तिजानुकरण), or to derive a pluta in a form like कॢ३प्तशिख. After a long back and forth argument over these issues, Patañjali finally rejects the necessity of including ऌ in this Śivasūtra: ऌकारोपदेश: ... प्रत्याख्यायते. In this long discussion, Patañjali does not bring in the Tantric usage of long ॡ, which probably developed long after Patañjali, nor does he imagine the possibility of a real life sandhi of ऌ+ऌ>ॡ, since no real Sanskrit word ends in or begins with ऌ. So the position of the grammarians is relatively clear, but the usage in Tantras that developed later transcends the limits assumed by the grammarians, and as I have indicated, produce even combinations of anusvāra and visarga. While Patañjali notes that no real word begins with ऌ, in his technical usage, one will find words like ऌकार, and occasions for Sandhi in expressions like नार्थ ऌकारोपदेशेन. Such technical usages then become examples of sandhis in later works like Siddhāntakaumudī where one can find मम+ऌकार: तव+ऌकार:. While Patañjali rejects the need to include ऌ in the Śivasūtra, his own technical usage like हि+ऌकारस्य allowed later grammarians to suggest the need for its inclusion. How would one apply rules like इको यणचि without the inclusion of ऌ in the Śivasūtra. Thus, inclusion of the technical usage of the grammarians within the scope of the object language to be described by the grammarians required some further adjustments.
