Dear Shri Veeraraghavan,

  

  You have raised an interesting issue. As far as I am aware, it is not thatॡ is phonetically not possible. It just does not occur in any normal Sanskrit vocabulary. However, as you point out, it is used in Mantra/Tantra texts. This is something like Pāṇini's use of many sounds in his metalanguage that does not correspond to the normal use of Sanskrit. If I remember correctly, some Buddhist Tantra texts offer bījamantras that have both an anusvāra and a visarga, something that is not found in normal Sanskrit usage. Here is an example written in the Siddham script:
