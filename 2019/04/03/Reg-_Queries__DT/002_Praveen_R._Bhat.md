Namaste Praveenji,

  

The English commentary (based on Kashika) by Shri Srisa Chandra Basu on Ashtadhyayi in various formats can be found here:<https://archive.org/details/ashtadhyayi>

  

Another great work by Prof. Ram Nath Sharma is also available on [archive.org](http://archive.org). I am not sure about the legality of sharing this work online (although it shows up as opensource license) being quite an expensive set, AFAIK.

  

Kind rgds,
