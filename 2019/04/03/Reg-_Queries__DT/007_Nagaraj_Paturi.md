Sir,

  

I did not talk about Amara Kosha, nor it's time period.

  

I was responding to the question from Sri Praveen about the earliest dictionary in Sanskrit.

  

I just reminded the most well known fact, but somehow did not figure in the thread that Nighantu is a Vedic time text , Nirukta is a Vedic time tradition and Yaska's Nirukta is a Vedic time work in the lexicographically tradition of India for that matter, of the world.

  

Interestingly the word, the technical term 'definition' is part of the contemporary lexicographically jargon and ' nirvachana' it's Sanskrit equivalent is the key concept of the Nirukta tradition.
