*Nirukta*is the systematic creation of a glossary and it discusses how to understand archaic, uncommon words.^([\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirukta#cite_note-monierwilliamsnirukta-1))The field grew probably because almost a quarter of words in the Vedic texts composed in the 2nd-millennium BCE appear just once.^([\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirukta#cite_note-jameslochtefeldsca476-2)[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirukta#cite_note-4)[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirukta#cite_note-5))

The study of*Nirukta*can be traced to the last centuries of the 2nd-millennium BCE[Brahmanas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahmana "Brahmana")layer of the Vedic texts.^([\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirukta#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHarold_G._Coward1990105-3))However, the most ancient complete surviving text of this field is a commentary on*Nighantu*by[*Yāska*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaska "Yaska"), who probably lived about the 7th century BCE.^([\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirukta#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHarold_G._Coward1990107-6))His text is also referred simply as*Nirukta*.^([\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirukta#cite_note-jameslochtefeldsca476-2)[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirukta#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHarold_G._Coward1990107-6))
