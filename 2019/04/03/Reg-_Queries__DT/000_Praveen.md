Respected Scholars,

  

I am looking for Astadhyaayii with English commentary(particularly for kAraka prakaraNa). Can you please share any online resource/open resource.  

  

Another doubt is that my student, is doing a M.A. project on Sentiment Analysis of niiti shatakam. We are looking for English commentary of Bhartrihari's niiti shatakam. I Kindly request you to share the .pdf/web site(any eresources).  

  

The last doubt is that, we would like to know the **history of Sanskrit Lexicography**. Which dictionary is oldest dictionary or the first dictionary in Skt. Are there any dictionaries during vedic period. I know very few. They are amarakosha by Amarasimha, ekaakshara niGaNtuH etc.  

  

  

I look forward for positive response from eminent scholars.

  

  

Sincerely,

Praveen
