I have enumerated all astronomy observations from Valmiki Ramayana. The add up to 575+. I have analyzed them with the logic of scientific discovery and have arrived at 12209 BCE as the year of Rama-Ravana Yuddha.  
  
The book is available in India via Subbu Publications. The details of ordering the book (12209 BCE) and two other books on Mahabharata are attached.

  

I have 100+ Youtube talks (short and long) on the subjects of Ancient Indian history. One may search using 'Nilesh Oak' in youtube.  
  
Recently I delivered a talk in Marathi @ Nashik, Here are the links
