Namaste Scholars,

As requested by many group members, please find below a summary in English of the excellent talk on Jyotisha in the Ramayana by Sri Murali, Asst. Professor of Jyotisha, Madras Sanskrit College. Before proceeding I would like to seek the pardon of all members for transliterating Sanskrit words below in plain English without using formats like IAST or ITRANS:

***Jyotisha in the Ramayana***

Vedas are the basis of all Dharma and the Shad Vedangas support the study of Vedas. Jyotisha is one of the Vedangas and is condidered to be the eye of Vedas. Itihasas, of which Ramayana is one, interpret the Vedas for the common man with real life examples so that the Dharma as taught by the Vedas becomes easily assimilable to everyone. Sage Vakmiki in his Ramayana has embedded a lot of Jyotisha. This talk is on the Jyotisha included in Ramayana.

Ramayana gives the following Jataka for Rama for a birth which took place in Chaitra masa, Navami tithi in Punarvasu nakshatra:

\[As – Lagna, Su – Sun, Mo – Moon, Ma – Mars, Me – Mercury, Jp – Jupiter, Ve – Venus, Sa – Saturn.\]

This is the famous chart with five grahas uccha and one swakshetra which is revered by many pious Hindus who as a part of their daily worship of Rama also take a look at this chart. But many modern astrologers argue that this chart cannot be correct. This is because if Sun is in Mesha as this chart depicts and Moon in Punarvasu nakshatra in Karkataka, the tithi cannot be Navami. Being in Punarvasu, the Moon is in the first 3 degrees 20 mins of Karkataka. The sage has not stated where in Mesha Sun is; so, it could be either in the beginning or in the end or somewhere in between. Accordingly, the tithi can only be Ashtami, Shashti or Saptami but it can never be Navami. Sri Murali answers this objection in 2 ways:

We all know that Makara Sankranti takes place on Jan 15 every year. Still one finds that in the chart of Swami Vivekananda who was born on Jan 12, the Sun is already in Makara. This is because of ayanamsa (Precession of equinoxes) which over a mere 150 years could cause such an anomaly. If this is so, what all anomalies could have taken place in the chart of Sri Rama who was born two yugas back.

Also, Jyotisha follows 5 siddhantas for the calculation of time. Among them Powlasha and Vashishta Siddhantas are beyond the comprehension of humans in Kali Yuga. Vashishta being the Kula Guru of the Ikshvaku clan would certainly have calculated Rama’s chart as per the rules of Vashishta siddhanta. If so, how can we humans make sense of such a chart in every way?

Another argument that is made against the genuineness of Rama’s Jataka is Why has Valmiki included only the Chart of Rama in Ramayana? Why has he not included the charts of several other important characters like Dasharatha, Sita, Lakshmana or Ravana? This clearly shows that Rama’s jataka we find in Ramayana was not originally included in it by Valmiki and that it is a subsequent interpolation. This is clearly an invalid argument. Valmiki is the author and he is well within his rights to decide what he will include or what he will not include in his work. He cannot be questioned on those decisions or for that reason what he has included cannot be faulted with. After Rama’s birth Valmiki has given the muhurta for only Rama’s Namakarana and not for samskaras like Seemamndha, Annaprasanam etc. Does this mean that Seemandha and Annaprasanam were not done at all for him or that the Namakarana muhurta that is given in Ramayana is a subsequent interpolation? One cannot question such decisions of the sage or draw wayward inferences from what he has decided to include and not include.

While talking about Sri Rama’s Namakaranam Valmiki says it was done on Thrayodashi. Modern astrologers argue that this is shastra viruddha because Jyotisha granthas like Muhurta Padavi clearly state that Namakarana should be done during the day and on a Dwadashi and that performing it later than on a Dwadashi is ashubha. But performing it as per Muhurta padavi would be Smriti Virodha for as per Smriti namakarana for a kshatriya should be done only on a thrayodashi. It is for being in line with the smriti only Vashishta would have fixed Namakarana on a Thrayodashi and there is nothing ashubha about it.

After Rama breaks the Shiv Dhanush, king Janaka suggests that marriage of Rama with Sita be fixed on a Uttara Phalguni day. Ramayana itself mentions that Rama broke the Shiv Dhanush on a Magha day. As per Bodhayana’s muhurta rules marriage can be performed on Magha, Mrigashira, Hasta, Swati, Moola, Anuradha, Revati, Rohini, Uttara Phalguni, Uttara Aashaadha and Uttara Bhadrapada days. While Magha was suitable for marriage, since that was the very day Rama broke the bow, Janaka being anxious for performing Sita’s marriage at the earliest, suggests the very next available muhurta on Uttara Phalguni which fell on the third day.

Then comes the matter of Pattabhishekam of Rama. Dasharatha calls Rama on a day and tells him that the very next day in Pushya nakshatra and in Karkataka lagna he intends to perform the Pattabhishekam of Rama and make him the king of Ayodhya. When Rama objects to the hurry, Dasharatha tells him that cruel planets like Mars, Sun and Rahu are now in Dasharatha’s janma nakshatra and he is also seeing many bad omens and inauspicious dreams. Astrologers tell him that these indicate grave danger to either the king or the kingdom. He wants to save the kingdom from such dangers and hence Rama should accept Dasharatha’s proposal without further demur. As we all know the Pattabhishekam did not take place on the appointed day and everything went wrong in Rama’s life. People argue that the muhurta fixed by Vashishta for Rama’s Pattabhishekam should have certainly been wrong and hence the subsequent misfortunes in his life. Sri Murali says this argument is ab initio wrong. One can fault a muhurta only when the appointed function takes place in that muhurta and misfortunes follow. How can the muhurta be faulted when the Pattabhishekam itself did not take place? The cause of the misfortunes in Rama’s life and the death of Dasharatha out of putra shokam is the fruition of the curse by a sage long back when Dasharatha had inadvertently killed the sage’s son and not because of an erroneous muhurta fixed for Rama’s Pattabhishekam.

Apparently, Valmiki does not believe in making his story more exciting by introducing elements like suspense and climax. When Rama and Lakshmana came searching for Sita, Jadayu who was holding his life just to give his message to them tells them that he saw Ravana carrying away Sita in his Pushpaka Vimanam but Rama will certainly get his wife back because blinded by passion Ravana had carried out the abduction in Vinda or Abhijit muhurta and the Jyotisha dictum whatever is lost in that muhurta will certainly be found and restored to its Swami.

It is not only Jyotisha that Valmiki covers in his epic at places he even brings in Vastu and Shakuna. During their wanderings in search of Sita, Rama tells Lakshmana that his mind is restless and that his left eye is uncontrollably fluttering and concludes therefrom that some misfortune is certainly lurking around the corner for them.

Also while talking about, Hanuman’s flight to Lanka, Valmiki waxes eloquent about the beauty of Lanka and while describing its beauty also mentions that Hanuman found that the palaces and houses in Lanka were built in accordance with the Vardhamana Vastu as per which Vastu palaces and houses in Lanka didn’t have doors opening out to the south. So, Valmiki says Hanuman entered Lanka from the south and as an ambassador took care to enter it with his left foot first in order to ensure success of his mission. The shastra says that an ambassador should always enter a king’s place with his left foot first and also in Prashna marga of Jyotisha an entry with left foot first is considered to be an auspicious portent for favourable outcomes. This is in contrast to the rule that for events like travel, grihapravesha, marriage etc. one should proceed with the right foot first.

Before concluding, I must confess that Sri Murali’s talk was much more impressive than what my disconnected translation of just the Jyotisha portions makes it appear to be. There was continuity in his talk and at appropriate places he embellished it with shlokas from both Ramayana and other Jyotisha granthas.

I do hope the members who requested for this translation find the above helpful.

Pranams,

Venkat.
