Namaste.  
Over and above analysing Rama's chart in accordance with jyotisha's principles, I feel it is the careful study of Rama's (and Krishna's) chart itself that throws light on many a foundational principles of jyotisha - for the chart contains within the necessary (if not sufficient) conditions for the advent (and the mode) of a Vishnu's avatara.
