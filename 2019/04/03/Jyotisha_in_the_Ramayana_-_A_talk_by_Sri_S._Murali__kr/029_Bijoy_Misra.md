I should say that Hanuman did not look for the stars to cross the ocean,

neither did he check the time to talk to Sita. We have to understand

the built-in insecurity of astrology as exhibited in Dasaratha (who

knew that his move was to hide his intent!)  

  

Ravana did not look for the stars to kidnap Sita, nor Rama did look

into the heavens to kill Vali!
