Dear Sri Bharath Sastry-ji,

  

Perhaps we may get an idea from the mentioned life spans of Dasratha and SriRama, respectively of 55,000 years and 11,000 years. As the Treta Yuga wound up, the lifespans substantially decreased. Even in Kaliyuga, we rarely see lifespans in excess of 100 years.

  

Regards,

Krishna Kumar Pillalamarri
