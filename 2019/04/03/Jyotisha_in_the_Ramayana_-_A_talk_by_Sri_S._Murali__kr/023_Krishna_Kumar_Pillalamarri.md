Sri Venkatraman,

  

You have done an admirable job capturing the gist of Sri Murali's talk. I found the talk illuminating. The only point, if one may call it that, is that the slide screen was hardly visible during the talk. This meant one had to imagine the jyotisha chakras, etc., while listening to Sri Murali.

  

I wish Murali a lot of success in his future endeavors.

  

Regards,

  

Krishna Kumar Pillalamarri
