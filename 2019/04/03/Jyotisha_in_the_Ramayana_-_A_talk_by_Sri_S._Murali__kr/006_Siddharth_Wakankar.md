Dear Shri Subramanian ji,

  

There were/ are at least 4/5 scholars from Maharashtra who tried to interpret the Jyotisha data in Mahabharata to fix the date of the Mahabharata war etc.

  

Just last week,Dr. P. V. Vartak,a medical practitioner from Pune,breathed his last. Some 40/50 years back, he tried his hand at fixing the dates of Ramayana and Mahabharata on the basis of Jyotisha references.

  

There were other scholars of the previous generation like Prof.G.W.Kavishvar from Indore,Advocate P V. Holay from Nagpur etc.eho also worked on these topics basing their arguments on Jyotisha material.Prof.R.V.Vaidya,who worked in the Ujjain Observatory for 22 years also did some work.He was the person who translated into English the Marathi History of Jyotisha written by Shankar Pandurang Dixit.

  

One more scholar from Baroda,Shri Godbole,also worked on the date of Mahabharsta war.

I personally knew all these older.generation scholars.

  

There must be some other scholars in modern times working on such topics. They will be benefited by this Tamil talk.

  

Thanks for sharing this vital information.

  

Warm regards,

  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
