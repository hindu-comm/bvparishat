Namaste

  

Enthused by the scholars here, I heard the speech in full. I am nobody to talk about Jyothisha as I know nothing of the shaastra. Yet, I found the talk very impressive, gripping, full of quotations from the Ramayana and the texts of the Jyothisha shaastra. A very scholarly presentation indeed. For such a young scholar, the delivery of a talk of this caliber is amazing.

  

He touched upon many aspects like Jataka, Shakuna and Prashna. Rama's jataka occupied a good deal of the talk. He said the Jataka itself says that five constellations were in ascendance, which is almost an impossibility in our present Kali yuga standards. He stated the objections the present day jyothisha experts raise against the horoscope of Rama and what replies can be given. He gave some instances of shakuna, and prashna. His was an unbiased presentation of the topic. He is quite well read and confident of his topic.

  

I do not know if he can deliver a talk in English or Sanskrit on the topic. In any case he is very promising. Many other works such as the Mahabharata offer a lot of scope for research on the jyothisha content in them. He works in the Madras Sanskrit College and if anyone wants to interact with him, that should not be difficult. On the whole it was an inspiring, interesting and involving experience listening to the talk.

  

I think someone interested in the talk, despite his unfamiliarity with Tamil, would benefit by spending an hour listening to the talk with a focus on just the quotations there, which are rendered with brilliant accuracy. 

  

warm regards
