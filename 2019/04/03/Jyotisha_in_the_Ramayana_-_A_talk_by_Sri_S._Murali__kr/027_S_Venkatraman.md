Namaste Sastryji,

  

Valmiki doesn’t mention anything about their placements. All the Jyotisha granthas that we use now, with the possible exception of Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra, are much much later than the time of Ramayana. Jyotisha must certainly have been in use at the time of Ramayana because Valmiki has talked about it, but it is a moot question if Rahu and Keith were in use then. Even now Jyotisha granthas don’t deal with Rahu and Ketu in as much detail as the other grahas and the disagreements between granthas are also much more in the case of Rahu and Ketu.

  

Regards,

Venkat
