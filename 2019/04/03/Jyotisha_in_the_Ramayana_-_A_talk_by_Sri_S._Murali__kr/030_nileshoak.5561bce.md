Right on the money. Entire Ramayan and Mahabharat has 800+ astronomy and associated references YET, only here (Rama-Janma) related verses one finds mention of 12 zodiac. Naturally , these verses are tampered with.

  

If one applies objective testing against the background of scientific acumen and logical reasoning, the evidence 1leads to 12209 BCE for Rama-Ravana yuddha and 5561 BCE for Mahabharat war.

  

No ifs and no buts.
