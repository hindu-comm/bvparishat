Namaste Venkatraman ji

  

Thank you for the inputs. You are right on the disagreements of these two grahas in recent various book in jyotisham.

Can you tell me know what would be the life span mentioned for a person in other yugas.

We know 120 years is the span for humans in Kaliyuga according to vimshottari dasha scheme.

Wanted to know the life span in the previous yugas.

  

Regards

Bharath Sastry
