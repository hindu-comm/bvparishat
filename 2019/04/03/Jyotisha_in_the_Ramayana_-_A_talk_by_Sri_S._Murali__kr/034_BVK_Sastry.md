Namaste



Please see highlighted points on post below, which are in need of further substantiation.



Please permit me to share some thoughts on this topic, where complex play of emotional factors are coloring the understanding of science history from Valmiki's work. I am placing below two links which may be worth exploring in relation to the topic under discussion: I hope Prof. Bijoy Misra and the like who have great appreciation for Ramayana will facilitate further in this work.



a) National Science Foundation resources which provide hard science research details and data on Astronomy - Time line, Stars and sky phenomenon - <https://www.nsf.gov/about/research_areas.jsp>

 The claim on Sky phenomenon, Biological human age and the like - in the talk above may need to find the right correlates across several connected disciplines of science here. 



b) How World opinion is shaped by the visual documentaries in the social media over the past several decades - CBS award-winning series and its future

CBS Religion documentary shows have spread what world religions are to society in a powerful way : –<https://religionnews.com/2019/04/05/future-of-decades-old-cbs-religion-documentary-program-in-doubt/>.



 Many of the views on Ramayana that one may find in these documentaries may need a serious revision.



**(Please don't get me wrong. I am one amongst you; and faithfully observe the upcoming Sri Ramanavami with a cultural appropriateness. Academics is different from the Faith-culture socio-cultural practice).**



All this study has a bearing on ( mis-) understanding and explaining Sri Rama related HISTORY, TIME-CALCULATIONS, CONNECTIONS of LITERATURE (Kaavya) TO Science of Sky- Stars - Sun and Moons in Vedanga Jyotisha for BIRTHCHART CASTING /GRAHA POSIITONS , Science of Ayurveda for human life longevity like 55,000 years (?!) . If we do not have sufficient knowledge, let us undertake research ; rather than substituting blank areas with 'claims of scientific type, which need serious evaluation'. 



At some point, one needs to see the issues of faith and cultural heritage understanding ( or mystic sacred divine yogic ... tags included) from the point of view of evidence in other sciences.



This is also a line of approach to explore what else traditional schools have to seek from other sciences to properly collate and build a credible understanding of 'Bharateeya Vidyas' based on heritage texts and ' language: Samskrutham'. This would help to understand why a specific question, like the one i am placing below , is formulated and is relevant as a chapter in the teaching of ' First Introduction to Samskruth Language ' . The key point is to make a clarity on ' What is Samskrutham? As a Language ( Bhashaa) how old is it? How stable it has been compared to rest of world languages and still survives with the same rigor ( although dying fast), through the processes of simplification, Romanization and the like ?



***Here below are some cold facts that need to be understood before the warmth of interpretation ingenuity over the given text flies high. *****



**a) *Issue of Textual integrity***: Our current ( traditional) understanding of Srimad Valmiki Ramayana is based on a certain text and language positioned to a period anywhere between 2000 BCE to 10000 BCE.

So, one cannot rule out questions on ' surviving text- integrity' , deeply connected with the 'Oral narrative tradition' similar to but not exactly as rigid as Vedas' ).



 This is one argument powerfully adapted when ' interpretations of classical texts in Samskruth language' are brought up.

The argument is by force of sheer historicity, life of scripting materials, vulnerability of human memory, plausible willful inclusions- omissions- commissions and the like, over the long span of the text in usage. 



**b) *Issue of Tradition of interpretation of given Text**** :* By faith implicit, we at India do take Ramayana is veda re-narrated in another yuga ( *vedah praachetasaat aaseet, saakshaat Ramayanaatmanaa*) ; and contains every science and spiritual tradition. But this line of argument is not accepted globally , especially in academia / colonial perspective !! So much so, for the connecting of the theological model of Sri Rama and Sri Krishna by 'Vishnu Dashavataara' model. I am yet to see any specific tradition in Vedanga Jyotisha and Vastu ( of early period) which cites Valmiki as an authority in the context of the disciplines; or even uses illustrations of Ramayana as a reference. ( It is nice to hear the sloka - api swarnamyee lankaa, na me lakshmana rochate; but if it is to be justified with gold metallurgy (swarna-vidya, mani-vidyaa) and related going back to the historic dates claimed, we need more evidence. Hard evidence is needed to back the claims.



**c) *Issue of Technology tools* :** The ' Bha-Chakra/ Rashi- Nakshatra calculation , the uccha and other concepts of horoscope are drawn from traditional Vedanga Jyotisha texts. Fine. How about the ' ganitha', the global frame of 'Time' to draw the chart ? The current researchers have (mostly relied) on one or other Sky-mapping software's which work on the NASA provided ephemeris and retro calculations on Gregorian calendar Time line . Is there any 'Vedanga Jyotisha school' which has done any research on the appropriateness of NASA calculations to the
'ganitha' of Valmiki and later on ?? Which is in other words, is asking the history of Indian Maths, Science of measurement, Time- Keeping and the like going back to Valmiki's period ?? . This is very
slippery area and ' Sensitive area by Religion-History-Science Research and Social relevance'. If the present claims in the lecture work out, Hinduism can claim to be the ancient most religion on earth and it must be so taught in ' history of India part - school syllabus ! A revision of school texts is a socially and politically intricate mess.





I wish the talk triggers more deliberations for the sustained study and research on these topics and help to build a collated harmonized history of India where we would be proud to call Valmiki as First Poet ( Aadi Kavi) before Nation called India came in to being.
