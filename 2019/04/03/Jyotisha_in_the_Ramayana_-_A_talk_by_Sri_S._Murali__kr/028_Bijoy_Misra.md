As a professional astronomer I have difficulty in handling this Muhurta  

business through 2D- sky mapping. Correlations worked at a time

when people thought of different spheres. But to make some knowledge

out of it through number work is incorrect. Eclipses or orbitals  

can be predicted, but time has no day or night.. I admire the  

calculations and development of mathematics.  

  

I spent a full week in studying Barahamihira, I was not happy that the

same correlations continue today. Islamic people brought the "luck"

theory, India became prosperous through creativity and work!

Sooner we adopt the principle of work, better for India!

Happiness is not created in the heavens, but in our hearts.

  

Sorry for my candid expression.
