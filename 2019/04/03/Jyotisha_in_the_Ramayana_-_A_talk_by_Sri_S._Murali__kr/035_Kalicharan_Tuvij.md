The question is not about hard facts, that we may never find out already (futile excercise).

The question being addressed is that of consistency. How to restitch the dissonance in our cognitions. This is a more fundamental problem and needs different approach.

For example, why don't we have a consistent picture of "Harappan" culture?

What is stopping Indian mind to dig deep into anything?

Who are the sentries that have facilitated such dissonance over a long time and continue to do so?

Do we - I, You - carry strains within ourselves that assist in this? Are we the right people? Why do we bring all irrelevant material at the first given opportunity?

 Who are the people that lead the counter narrative movement - are they sure this movement will not lead/evolve to same side they are opposed to (as it has done so in the history)?

 People talk about misinformation floating about Hinduism - but even the most uninformed/ disinformed person in the world knows this religion is polytheistic. Do our scholars know it?

I'll not be contributing further in this thread.
