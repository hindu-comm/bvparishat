Dear listfolk,

  

Does anyone have a link where one can buy or download various editions of the shiva sahasranAma(I am looking for the one spoken by upamanyu in particular). I want a shuddha pATha,since the version I am hearing has quite a few differences with the one in my hands(an old one by Naval Kishore Press),but is clearly the one spoken by Upamanyu,

  

Thanking in advance,

  

Sreekar.
