Sreekar,

  

Please see the description of the Pradosha Vrata in the dharma sindhu below, under trayodashInirnayaH:

  

<https://archive.org/details/DHARMASINDHU/page/n45>

  

Essentially, the period after sunset that lasts for 3 Muhurtas (6 Ghatis) is called Pradosha. For Pradosha Vrata, consisting of Shiva Puja, etc., pradoSha-vyApini trayodashI is suitable. If such a trayodashI has vyApti over (covers) the pradoSha kAla on two consecutive days or has ekadesha-vyApti over (covers partially) equally on two consecutive days, the second day is chosen for following the pradoSha vrata. If the trayodashI partially covers both days but with a longer duration on the first day, enough to complete the Shiva Puja and bhojana that follows, then the first day is chosen, else the second day. If there is no vyApti on either day, the second day is chosen for the vrata. Of course, if the trayodashI covers the pradoSha kAla completely on any day but not on the following day, then that day itself is chosen for the vrata.

  

Anand
