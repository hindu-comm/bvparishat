Dear listfolk,

  

It is wellknown that the pradosha vrata occurs on trayodashis,etc. Can anyone,with citations from nibandhas,purANas,other works for dharmashAstra,etc explain when exactly does pradosha kAla begin and end?There is quite a bit of variation/confusion in this matter.

  

Thanking in advance,

Sreekar.
