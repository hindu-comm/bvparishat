My aunt (my father's sister) used to do Shiva puja on pradosha day of the Shukla Paksha. She would take bath at stone spout below the temple before the sunset, and without uttering a word climb to the temple and do the puja. She would not touch the Shivalinga, we would pick flowersfrom the Shivalingafor her. She kept her silence till she came out of the temple. I think the whole puja would be complete before the sunset.

Later, she did some special puja (udyapana?), and would go to temple if the pradosha day happened to be Saturday (Shani Pradosh).
