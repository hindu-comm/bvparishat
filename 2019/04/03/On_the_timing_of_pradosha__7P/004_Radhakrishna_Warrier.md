Interesting. Here is my personal experience with pradosham.

  

In my boyhood, my maternal grand uncle (mother's uncle) used to take me to the nearby Shiva temple on pradosham days. He would urge me to pray to Lord Mahadevar (Lord Shiva) to cure my stammering. As a boy, I used to stammer (or stutter as they say in the US) heavily. My grand uncle also stammered and told me that he too was praying to Lord Mahadevar to cure his stammer.

  

My grand uncle lived to be 95 and I think he stammered to his last day.
I continue to stammer, though not as heavily as in boyhood.
