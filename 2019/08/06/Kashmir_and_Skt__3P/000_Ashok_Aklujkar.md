To the highly helpful bibliographic information that is being shared, may I add:

  

Mrinal Kaul and AshokAklujkar.2008. *Linguistic Traditions of Kashmir.*New Delhi: D.K. Printworld. Pp. XXIV + 609.

  

Here, “linguistic” is to be understood as standing for anything that is related to language, not in the narrow sense of the word found in usages such as “Department of Linguistics.”

  

It may interest some BVP members that the volume has three articles in which I have argued that Patañjali, the Vyākaraṇa-mahābhāỵa author, was a Kashmirian.
