The palm manuscript mentioned above is damaged where they have mentioned about Venus. As i am the one who deciphered the above verse, i want to make it clear that i have guessed the missing words from the position of Ketu. Also, this leaf has a lot of verses written in it very closely, making it difficult to decipher it fully. This will be a difficult task for any one person to decipher the manuscript, alone. Therefore, if there are others who can contribute in deciphering these manuscripts, we can share the work and try deciphering it in parts. Also, this will help in proofreading the verses deciphered. The earlier lagna collections were deciphered by scholars recruited by the government, but we cannot expect the government to take this up after such a long time. We need to locate like-minded people capable of deciphering the manuscripts.
