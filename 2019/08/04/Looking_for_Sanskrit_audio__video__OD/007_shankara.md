Irene ji,

  

The website of Purnaprajna Samsodhana Mandira, Bengaluru has a good collection of Sanskrit lectures on Viveka Chudamani, Nyaya Muktavali, etc. Some of the resources are in Kannada. It is unfortunate that the webmaster did not think of segragating the resources language-wise.

Audio files of chanting (Patha) of 4 Mahakavyas with tika of Mallinatha, Sanakarabhashya of some Upanishads and Siddhanta Kaumudi are available at  

<http://vedabhoomi.org/SanskritChanting.html>  

  

regards  
shankara
