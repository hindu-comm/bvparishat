May I solicit comments on 10 YouTube videos at \<<https://studio.youtube.com/channel/UCHnw6UVN1Q6wLgEsbuyuMVA/videos/upload?filter=%5B%5D&sort=%7B%22columnType%22%3A%22date%22%2C%22sortOrder%22%3A%22DESCENDING%22%7D>\>

The one on शिवसूत्राणामभ्यासःis totally in Sanskrit.

The other 9 are for those wanting to learn Sanskrit through English medium.

8 out of 9 are on learning Reading and Writing Sanskrit i.e. explaining the देवनागरी script. Total 99:11 mins.

I surprised myself that videos for explaining just the देवनागरीscript would become such an engaging exercise.

For a person of Marathi mother tongue, acquaintance with देवनागरीscriptwas but natural.

Explaining it for others became that much engaging and hence the surprise !
