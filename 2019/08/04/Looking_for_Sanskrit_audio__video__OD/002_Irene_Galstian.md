These are good videos, but they don't bridge the glaring gap in the  
Sanskrit acquisition process: there isn't enough audio/video  
containing comprehensible input in fluent Sanskrit, produced by people  
whose own Sanskrit it fluent and who have good diction.  
By 'comprehensible input' I mean materials for which more or less  
reliable translations exist.  
Filling this gap will accelerate Sanskrit acquisition by at least 3-5 times.  
I'm not talking about the so-called 'spoken Sanskrit' here. I'm saying  
that anyone with good Sanskrit, e.g. Sanskrit received through family  
lineage (as contrasted with places like Samskrita Bharati), can  
provide valuable service and feel good in the process, in the  
following way.  
Take a well-known book written in fully fledged Sanskrit, take a  
mobile phone or another device capable of recording voice, read this  
book at normal speed with proper intonation, and upload the  
audio/video to where others can hear it. That's all that's required.  
Even if you record your favourite Panctantra story, which has already  
been recorded by others, that's fine. It's still valuable because it  
allows the hearer to experience different people reading the same  
text. If you don't like Pancatantra but love Sankara, you could record  
your favourite pieces from his work.  
I feel embarrassed writing such obvious things, but these things do  
make a lot of difference in language acquisition. Anyone who has  
taught living people would attest to that.
