By all means, Sir.  
Let there be research into traditional methods of teaching and let  
these methods be reinstated for the benefit of all. But these methods  
aren't available to all now, and the recordings and the text are  
available to may, if not to all. Let us then, without being lazy, use  
faithfully what's available to us now, since faithfulness and  
gratitude bring good regard by the source of creation - and then new  
opportunities are given.  
  
Irene
