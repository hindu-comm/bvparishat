Here's one YouTube playlist I found few days back with 76 audio/videos:<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFPS3AI8hf4&list=PLpQCHvng-MEAMJFexVpgN2G7JTMWq9EEs>

  
Since I haven't gone through them all, I am not sure if all are as good, but I hope you find them useful. In fact, I found that a lecture in English somehow made into the list.

  

Kind rgds,
