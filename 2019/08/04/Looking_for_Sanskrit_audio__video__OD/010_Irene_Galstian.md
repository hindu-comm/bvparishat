Shankara ji,  
  
Thank you for these valuable recordings.  
I'm in the process of forwarding these findings to other interested  
groups and decided to include links to English and Hindi translations  
of the texts involved, so as to facilitate the 123 formula:  
1. See the sentence.  
2. Hear the sentence.  
3. Look up what the sentence means.  
  
With Sankara bhashyas and Siddhanta Kaumudi all's well (maybe I'll  
clean up the SK audio a bit, let's see what people say when they hear  
it), but I don't recall seeing the Mallinatha's commentaries used in  
these recordings into English or Hindi. Clearly this is a sign of my  
ignorance, since Mallinatha is too well-known to remain untranslated.  
If you've seen such translations, please could you point me in their  
direction? Even if scans aren't yet available, I'd be very happy to  
purchase physical books.  
  
Best wishes,  
Irene
