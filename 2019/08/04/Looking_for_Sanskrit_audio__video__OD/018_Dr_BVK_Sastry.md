1. It is nice to expect the world to be all plain with environment as cool as a regulated air-conditioned room ! but the reality is not so. And certainly not for Samskruth teams!

2. I agree that there is glaring gap in the Sanskrit acquisition ( and through that ' CONTROL Sanskrit Education, Tools, Applications et al).

 Digital Tools and technologies are fine, useful in bridging the gap of distance between instructor and learner to facilitate
asynchronous learning in a progressive way; but they are neither a substitute or equivalent of hard way of learning. The hard way of learning Samskruth, a continuity of a teacher-taught guru-kul
tradition delivered centuries of great scholars of Samskrutham. The post colonial print media- class room books and slate- pencil class room technologies caused a sudden spurt of guardians of Samskrth through formal school education. The post computers Spoken Sanskrit and smart phone technologies caused a sudden spurt of appreciators of Samskrth through social media.

You can see that the goal in three scenarios are different; and the tools sought, the pedagogy and outcome are different. The glaring gap you point to is the gap between the ' primary 'guru-Kul' tradition and rest two models above. There is a serious need to research on pedagogy of 'Core Guru- Kul' tradition before it can be ported to ' Digital resource, and a free public resource through You-tube model channels.

There are two dangerous deadly issues in this apparently ' sweet pill' working as a carrier of poison to 'destroy the live teacher of tradition'. One is killing the 'Guru' and Two, Killer intention of Competition and brand megalomania through technology.

The sweet pill part satisfies and creates a student- beginners euphoria of ' Feel Good of doing good things' ! The tendency of student learner is ' to seek free resources' for learning ( You-Tube model of Help Text / Do it Yourself / How to do and subscribe to my channel - model promo materials / uploaded tonnes of videos and digital resources') . The content which were Guru owned and customized in teaching now becomes the ' Channel and Technology owned delivery, missing the guidance and blessing of Master ! This is promotion of 'supervision - audit- free self learning model' , which walks on the corpse of a teacher, to enrich a technology channel. given the fact that You-tube is free channel with its own terms , there are one to ten ' private paid channels' and technology channels which are less popular, even though they promote good content.

The second part is once the content gets on You-Tube channel ( or for that matter, to any social media channel, in essence) the situation is same !

The ' teacher' becomes almost like the 'banana plant after yielding its first and only fruit' !

The DRM terms of You-tube content reads:

 ( [*https://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/dec/20/who-owns-content-you-upload*](https://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/dec/20/who-owns-content-you-upload%20%20)
)

There is no value in ' retaining ownership' of something which is freely distributable by another person, at will, globally ! In essence, the master who pushes the youtube channel content is lowly on the path of 'self mortification ' and also ' murder of other fellows of profession'; and origin of spreading unaudited education of tradition !

The learners effort, how so ever skilled in using the You-tube content, would end up as assembling thousand brains from corpses to construct a ' living brain' . Some miracle needs to happen if such things ever worked in Nature, beyond faith stories .



***My request*** : If we can educate the ' Traditional Teacher' to use technology better to save the 'pedagogy' and support the masters to own and run Techno- Guru-Kul' Schools to groom human resources of quality, the scenario is likely to change in the next five years! Otherwise, there may come a ' Sanskrit-Watson- Computer' owned by a global corporate from which ' paid learning of traditional education' will be streamed!

**Pl. dont tread the path of making a****** **'****mummy of Guru'** **compelled** **to****** **be** **speak****ing** **through the '** **cage in** **cl****oud****' !**

BVK Sastry

(P.S. I am not suggesting any gloomy dooms-day prophesies in this. I am serious on how to strategize Guru-kul continuation through Technology', along with careful steps to prevent ' Machine taking over Guru'. Those intersted may discuss on this off line pl.
