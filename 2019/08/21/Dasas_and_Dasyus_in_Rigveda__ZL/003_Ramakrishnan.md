Namaste,  
  
When we speak of the Rgveda, we are talking of a bigger region to the north-west of India with which the Vedic people were interacting (not merely the Indus/Punjab valley which was the home of the early Vedic civilization).  
  
There were civilizational links with Iran (who were also following Vedic deities until the start of Zoroastrianism around 800-700 BCE or thereabouts).  
  
The uttara-mādras([](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medes)[Medes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medes)), Uttara-kurus (dominion of
[Kūruš](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrus_the_Great) i.e. "Cyrus") & Kambojas & Parama-Kambojas (Domain of
[Kambūǰiya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambyses_II) i.e. "Cambyses") are all peoples that are frequently mentioned in Vedic texts as following closely related cultures, and even some Vedic Rishis (and acharyas) are reputed to have lived among them - for example Kauhala, Salamkayana, Upamanyu, Madragara Shaungayani, Kamboja Aupamanyava,
Sati Austraksi etc are some of the names from the Vamsha Brahmana as being based in the Kamboja/uttara-Madra janapadas.  
  
The further we go back into the past, the more Iranians were similar to Indo-Aryans culturally. So there is no surprise that both Vedic texts and Iranic texts mention the Dasas & Dasyus even though they were living on the north-western borderlands or even further north-west outside India's current borders. The Indian janapadas were counted under the term madhyadesa  
  
However Zoroastrian texts were not originally composed in Iran proper, but in and around Afghanistan (where Zoroaster was born) - so the dasas and dasyus of the Rgveda may have been geographically close to both the Indic and Iranic groups.
