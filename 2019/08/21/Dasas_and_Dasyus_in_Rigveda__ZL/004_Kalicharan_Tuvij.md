Namaste.

Below is a reading based on my personal research:

dasyu = those not within (i.e. "below") Arya fold.  
dAsa = dasyu incorporated (of own accord/ vanquished) into Arya fold (1st generation).

dAsa is a sub-branch of shudra and mostly implied low-profile, humble, livelihoods. paricharya connotation for shudra directly comes from dAsa class within shudra-s.

Only shudra varNa had the capacity to lift dasyu-s upto Arya fold : no other varNa could do it. Devata involved : parjanya.

Children of dAsa-s had bright prospects further embedding into Arya fold, though we do find some evidence of struggle recorded in Upanishad-texts.

Comparisons with Avesta etc is not fruitful as their connection with Veda is not relational rather heirarchical (tree). Infact it is the very "othering" movement (of conjuring things/people as absolute evil) that led to Zoroastrianism and subsequently other monotheisms.
