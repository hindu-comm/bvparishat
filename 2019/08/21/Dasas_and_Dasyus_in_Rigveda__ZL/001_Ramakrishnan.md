Namaste,  
  
In my understanding Dasyu & Dāsa in the Rgveda represent a broadly similar set of peoples/tribes (since they are sometimes referred to in the Rgveda within the same mantra by both names) so it may be sensible to treat them both as similar peoples, but the fact that they have separate names probably means that they had some distinction between them (i.e. they might have been similar but not identical). Also these Dāsas & Dasyus in early Vedic texts are usually people who are powerful and in cultural conflict not only with the Vedic society but also the word is used to refer to opponents of Indra (such as three headed serpent monster Vrtra) whom he defeats (note the close parallel in Iranic serpent demon azi dahaka . Namuci and śambara are also called dāsas in Vedic texts, and śambara is the enemy of divodāsa. In later texts, these dāsas are also called asuras.

  
Taking the evidence from the Iranian side, both dāsas and dasyus are mentioned in Zoroastrian texts (as dahae and dahyu) - and in parallel with classical Sanskrit texts, the early Iranian texts classify these tribes as opposed to themselves culturally, but in later Iranian texts, they are listed with other Iranian texts who had embraced Zoroastrianism (asura worship). Still the Iranian texts portray them as robbers and people of low respectability. For more information on the Iranic connections, refer to <https://www.livius.org/articles/people/dahae/> & <http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/dahyu->  

  
There is another category of beings who are dāsas i.e. they are common servants within Vedic society (not necessarily opposed to that society) and are not shown to be from a different cultural background. For example divodāsa ("servant of the devas") is a Vedic name that immediately comes to mind having this meaning (of common servant).  
  
Some scholars (usually western) try to mischievously translate the word dāsa (for servant) as slave. I do not think there is much evidence to support that idea as slavery implies the following factors:  
1. Ownership of human beings by other human beings  
2. Some form of bonded labour and physical imprisonment (and/or restricted movement)  
3. Trading in human beings (slave trade) and applying prices and/or barter values on them  
  
I do not believe there is any evidence to indicate that these factors existed either in Vedic India or later on to indicate the existence of Slaves, slavery as a cultural practice or slave trading as an economic reality in ancient India, so we may safely (on the weight of substantial evidence) say dāsas (servants) were not equated with slaves either in India or in Iran.  

  

Regards,  
Ramakrishnan
