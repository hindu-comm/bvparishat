Namaste,  
I have made a pdf file listing down the 7 basic concepts in Sanskrit language which basically gives a detailed idea of what the language exactly is, and how it works, to give people proper understsnding of the language before actually stating with conversation.  
  
Here is the link to the file.

Please tell me if there are any technical errors (other than typos) in this course.  
  
Namaste.  
Regards  
Rishi.
