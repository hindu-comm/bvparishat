Thank you for this, Professor Paturi.

  

<https://groups.google.com/d/msg/bvparishat/uyT2o_E3c_I/cR_9pru4BgAJ> and<https://groups.google.com/d/msg/bvparishat/Rq_68NKrk4w/4TxCiE8nBgAJ>—recent posts in BVP with links to other uploads in Academia ofMichel Danino\*—might perhaps make for contextually complementary reading to the one that has just been posted.

  

Very few contextually-relevant entries can, perhaps, be added to the impressive (and tending towards being comprehensive) bibliography found in the paper of Michel Danino that has just been posted. Of those few, one strain of other original thinking—vis-a-vis Aryans, Horse,ऋगवेद (and more)—that could certainly merit a place would be the chapter*Horse and the Aryans* (pp. 56-73)in Singh, Bhagwan. (1995). [*The Vedic Harappans*](https://www.amazon.in/Vedic-Harappans-Bhagwan-Singh/dp/8186471049/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=vedic+harappans&qid=1566446498&s=gateway&sr=8-2). Also, while Bryant and Patton (2005) can perhaps be reasonably credited, as Danino has done, for having "tried to bring the two camps into a dialogue of sorts," that volume, it can be reasonably argued, loses its "neutral stance" not only in the ad-hominems found in Fosse's reductionist essay (see<https://groups.google.com/d/msg/bvparishat/kKxASUdOir4/BxFd0dJWBAAJ>, for instantiation) but also in Bryant's own tilt when it came to evidence value of conclusions from linguistics (see [Sastry and Kalyanasundaram](https://www.academia.edu/38556391/The_A_of_ABC_of_Indian_chronology_Dimensions_of_the_Aryan_problem_revisited_in_2017)). Furthermore, positing a **binary** of sorts, that is, only two camps (either the so-called Invasion/migration into-India camp or the so-called 'Out of India' (OIT) camp) and dismissing or ignoring others—which is not uncommon but which Danino is careful not to do (as evident from his paper where he has referred to scholars such as Sethna and Dhavalikar having proposed "different counter-theories")—has been questioned, for instance, also in Marcantonio and Jha (2013) as also in Singh (1995) \[these could be two of few more additions to the list featuring Sethna and Dhavalikar\]. On the point about the binary (either AI/MT into-India camp or OIT camp),Kalyanaraman, in this[review](http://bharatkalyan97.blogspot.com/2018/07/review-of-manogna-and-meghs-paper.html) of[Sastry and Kalyanasundaram](https://www.academia.edu/38871328/The_A_of_ABC_of_Indian_chronology_Dimensions_of_the_Aryan_problem_revisited_in_2017)notes the "dismissal" of such a binary and the implicit \[and sometimes explicit {as found in Trauttmann (2007)}\] transfer of the burden of proof (see relevant excerpt from review in the image immediately below) when such a binary—if one is questioning or critiquing AI/MT into-India, then one has to explain/defend PIE (which, until today, has no historical attestation) using OIT—isposited.

To close this note, while there is certainly much more to learn and gain from, rather than to observe about (or add to) this paper of Michel Danino, its importance and timing cannot at all be lost on those who is familiar with Witzel (2019) \[for the title of Witzel (2019) and a limited response to some of his arguments, see image below, from a recent (Aug 02) presentation *[Aryan problem from the perspective of Textual Evidence and Linguistics](https://www.academia.edu/40037600/Aryan_problem_from_the_perspective_of_Textual_Evidence_and_Linguistics_Aug_02_2019_)*delivered at University of Delhi\], who is still persisting with a horse argument.
