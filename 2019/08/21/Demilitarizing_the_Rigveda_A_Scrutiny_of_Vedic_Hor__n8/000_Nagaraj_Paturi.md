I have written a paper entitled “Demilitarizing the Rigveda: A scrutiny of Vedic horses, chariots and warfare.” It challenges persisting colonial readings of the Rigveda as a “horse-centred” text of warfare and conquest; I drew inspiration from the work of a scholars, but the paper is mostly based on my own study of the Rigveda, starting with the issue of the horse.



A preprint of the paper is available here. I hope you will find it interesting:
