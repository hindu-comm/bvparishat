श्रीमन् DR Y N RAO-महोदय  

Glad to inform that apropos your suggestion I added a [new post # 133](https://slabhyankar.wordpress.com/2019/08/22/lesson-no-133-%e0%a4%8f%e0%a4%9c%e0%a4%a8%e0%a5%8d%e0%a4%a4%e0%a4%82-%e0%a4%a6%e0%a5%80%e0%a4%b0%e0%a5%8d%e0%a4%98%e0%a4%82-%e0%a4%b5%e0%a4%bf%e0%a4%b8%e0%a4%b0%e0%a5%8d%e0%a4%97%e0%a4%bf/) on how to do मात्रा-counting for letters in a verse.

The post is also [index](https://slabhyankar.wordpress.com/2018/12/06/index-of-lesson-nos-and-%e0%a4%b8%e0%a5%81%e0%a4%ad%e0%a4%be%e0%a4%b7%e0%a4%bf%e0%a4%a4-s/)ed in the Index linked here.

Link to the YouTube video\<<https://youtu.be/2lcKwBB1jpU>\>is given both in the post and in the index.

People would be able to download the post for handy reference and alongside listen to and view the video.

  

As mentioned, I started the study with सानुस्वारश्च दीर्घश्च विसर्गी च गुरुर्भवेत्, but thought it good to compose a modification by myself, for reasons explained.

I hope that my modification appeals to people.
