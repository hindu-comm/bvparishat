Dear Shri Pradyumna ji

  

Please also mention the panchanga you follow since I think from a previous thread, the ekadashi calculations differ and what is ekadashi for a smartha may not be ekadashi for a Vaishnava.

  

I have a question..I agree that complete fast nirjala is the ideal state.

If someone has a rather strong jataraagni is there a second best option like fruits, nuts?

Also what practices are avoided on Ekadashi ? I understand that if children go to school should they avoid sport etc?

  

ISKCON which subscribes to the Brahma Madhva Gaudiya sampradaya seems to advocate avoiding grains and seeds since they aver that adharma takes refuge in grains and seeds on that day. I have traditionally seen a sumptuous feast at different ISKCONs during Ekadashi mostly sabu-dana vadas, kichdi, buckwheat and sabudana payasa. Another rather weird practise of offering grains to other devotees who visit the temple on that day of ekadashi under the explanation that they are "karmis" (their word not mine).

  

Do you have an explanation for the above?

  

Kind Regards,

  

Venkat
