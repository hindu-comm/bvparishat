Hello Sri Pradyumna ji,  
  
Thank you very much for the response. I follow our mutt(uttaradi) panchanga too, to observe thithis. My doubts are more about procedure to be followed on the night of dasami, the day of ekadasi & the morning of dvadasi.  
  

1.  If we observe ekadasi from the start of sunset, what kind of meal is
    to be taken the dasami(previous) night? 2.  What can be the first item in the meal to be consumed on Dvadasi
    parayana? 3.  I follow a fitness routine. It's a athlete fitness training & yoga
    unlike regular gym. In this case what is your advice about doing
    Ekadasi upavasa? 4.  Are there any reference texts/material that gives us guidance on the
    same. 5.  Finally, what are the health benefits in general.

  
Thank you.
