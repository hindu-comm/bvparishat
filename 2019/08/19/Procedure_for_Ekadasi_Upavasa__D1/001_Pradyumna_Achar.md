Respected Sri. Rahul,

I belong to the same community. Panchanga is required to perform ekadasi vrata properly. This is what we do in our family:

- Refer to the panchanga and check on which day the fast is to be observed (sometimes it comes on the ekadasi tithi, sometimes on the dwadasi tithi).

- Under some conditions, there will be two consecutive days during which the fast is to be observed. This will be mentioned in the panchanga too.

- During the day(s) of the fast, we shouldn't eat/drink anything.

- The day before the start of the fast will sometimes have a time specified after which we shouldn't eat/drink anything.

- The parane day (day on which we have to break the fast), will sometimes have a time specified until which we shouldn't eat/drink anything. If no time is specified, it will be sunrise time. There will sometimes be a time specified before which we should finish the parane.

Unlike other vratas (chaturmasya, vishnupanchaka etc), ekadasi is not optional. People from all varnas and ashramas should perform it.

Regards

Pradyumna
