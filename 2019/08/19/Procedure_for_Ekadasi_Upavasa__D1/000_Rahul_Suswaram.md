--Govinda--

  

I belong madhwa brahmin community. I observed my ancestors following the tradition of Ekadasi Upavasa. Now my father, after his retirement from his job started following Ekadasi Upavasa.

  

In regard to this, I want to know the due procedure/rules for following Upavasa vrata. I also would like to know the procedure that is to be followed for Dvadasi parayana.

  

Kindly mention any reference guides on the same.

  

Dhanyavada.
