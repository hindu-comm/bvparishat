Dear Shri Rahul

I am a smartha but I will answer the general qns from prior experience of having kept upavasa

1.  If we observe ekadasi from the start of sunset, what kind of meal is
    to be taken the dasami(previous) night?---> Make it a medium
    meal...Do not overeat which will cause gastric distress and
    unbalance the doshas next day. Eat something that digests well and
    easily. Avoid preparations like raagi or urid that inflame agni the
    previous night and which will leave you with a higher agni in the
    morning 2.  What can be the first item in the meal to be consumed on Dvadasi
    parayana?--> The logic in ayurveda is to move from easily digestible
    meals to bring the agni back to peak potency... so as to gradually
    build up agni..it is like building a homaagni, you cannot throw in
    the flowers, fruits and other stuff until the agni has been built up
    with samitas and coconut pieces...So in this case mung dal payasa
    (with jaggery) as suggested by Pradyumna ji makes sense. 3.  I follow a fitness routine. It's a athlete fitness training & yoga
    unlike regular gym. In this case what is your advice about doing
    Ekadasi upavasa?--> Once you have decided to follow dharma, dharma
    becomes moola in all other considerations. In your case, if you
    decide to follow, follow completely or do not follow at all. Half
    way here and there does not work in matters of dharma (with a few
    exceptions like nityakarma). I would advise you to do some light
    yoga without straining on the day of upavasa. Avoid any work with
    weights etc...and whether you fast or not, avoid proteins on that
    day.. 4.  Are there any reference texts/material that gives us guidance on the
    same.--> There is a member Shri Anand Hudli who was kind enough to
    guide...He suggested "kala madhava" which he quoted as a source for
    ekadashi related claculations etc. 5.  Finally, what are the health benefits in general.--> Following
    dharma is for its own sake, but it doesnt hurt to know of positive
    side effects....a gentle note to my friend Shri Pradyumna quoting
    God's order without knowing the source will not help. We call Him
    Bhagavan here (whether madhva or smartha). God and Bhagavan have
    different connotations. So use the right terms please.

The different sampradayas look at the same elephant from different angles. My gentle request to you is to look into the opinions of different acharyas on the same issue and you will get a more holistic picture for yourself.

  

If you are starting an ekadashi upavasa after the age of 25 etc I would advice you to take it slowly...for the first few ekadashis see how you last on a fruit fast and then go the full way--nirjala.

There is no point trying to fast one fine day, ending up with a migraine and giving up ekadashi altogether.

  

The other point is this: I hope you follow your nityakarmas and other anushtanas. Without trikalasandhya, Brahmayajna and agnikarya ...ekadashi alone will not give punya

There are adhikaras for every vrata..even though ekadashi is a nitya vrata for everyone from age 8 to 80 yathashakti...still without basic anusthanas..:(

  

If a high jathara agni is a problem, have a little pravala panchamrutam with melted ghee to manage it..

My 2 cents,

  

Regards,

  

Venkat
