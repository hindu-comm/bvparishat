Respected Sri Rahul,

  

1 \>

If the panchanga mentions a harivaasara start time in the dashami night, we should not eat/drink anything beginning that time. If there is no mention of such a time, it is assumed to be from \~96 minutes (4 ghatika) before sunrise. (Sunset time has nothing to do with this.).

On the dashami night, before the start of the upavasa time, I don't know of any pramaana regarding what should or should not be eaten. (Generally I've seen that people don't take a full meal, but I don't know of any pramaana for it)

  

2 \>

Paarane must be performed on the day after the fast has ended and within the time specified. Even if a person doesn't have anything to eat, at least they should drink water. (Generally I've seen that people take moong dal payasa first, but I don't know any pramaana for that)

  

4>

Many puranas mention about ekadasi vrata. Krishnamrutamaharnava has a collection of verses from various puranas on this topic.

  

3,5> I don't know

  

Regards

Pradyumna
