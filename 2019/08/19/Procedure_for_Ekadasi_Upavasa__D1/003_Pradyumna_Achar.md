Respected Sri Venkat,

  
  
 \> Please also mention the panchanga you follow

 Within the maadhwa community, there are many mathas. Each matha publishes their own panchanga, and the followers of a particular matha generally follow their panchanga. I don't know about smarthas.

  

 \> If someone has a rather strong jataraagni

 Please refer to the many videos by Maadhwa yatis and vidwans on this topic, such as this short 6-minute clip:<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCx0WLzW_uE>



> Also what practices are avoided on Ekadashi

I don't know.

  

> ISKCON which subscribes to the Brahma Madhva Gaudiya sampradaya

They don't follow the Madhwa sampradaya. This page has some details about the differences (I'm not associated with this webpage) -<http://www.dvaita.org/shaastra/iskcon.shtml>  


> since they aver that adharma takes refuge in

In Madhwa sampradaaya, the reason for doing this vrata is because it is God's order to do it, and not because "grains are polluted on that day", "it cleanses the body", "it fights cancer" etc etc. Those things may or may not be true. Even if the opposite were true (such as "grains are pure on that day", "it pollutes the body", "it causes cancer" etc), it doesn't matter. There's God's order on this and we follow it.

  

Regards

Pradyumna
