Dear Shri Pradyumna ji-->

  

Although I spent 10 months in Bangalore, my Kannada is rusty.

  

Kindly give me the salient points from the video please.

  

I understand that smarthas follow a different panchanga than Madhvas.

  

My request to you on suggesting which version of panchanga you follow was for the benefit of the original poster who asked about how to keep ekadashi upavasa. Since you belong tpo the same sampradaya, it will be easier for him to follow your anushtana.

Since many try to follow dharma but do not know how, it might help him to give full details on Panchanga etc.

  

Kind Regards,

  

Venkat
