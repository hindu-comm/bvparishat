Dear Irene,

  

I read one book, An Introduction to Lithuanian,by some three scholars from USA.I just forgot their names,though,I tried my best to contact them many times through aerogrammes and emails,but, unfortunately,no reply from any oneof them, since nearly 20/25 years.

Therein I found many similarities in language,diction,grammar, customs etc.

  

I have a book by a Lithuanian diplomat wherein he describes his experiences during his stay in India and in that book,he has brought out some similarities between these two languages and cultures etc. A very interesting book,written in simple English,which I got through a Maharashtrian Lt. Colonel,staying in Bangalore and his younger brother,another Rtd.Lt.Col.,was my next door neighbour in Vadodara.

  

By the way,I am eagerly waiting for your reply to my mail sent on 22nd ultimo.

  

Warm regards and many thanks.

  

Prof. Siddharth Y. Wakankar.
