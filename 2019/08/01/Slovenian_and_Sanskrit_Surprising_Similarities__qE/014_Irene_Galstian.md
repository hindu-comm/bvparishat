Dear Professor Wakankar,  
  
I found the 3 author book, and it's now in the folder I shared with  
you. It's in 3 parts, and the parts are marked accordingly.  
Just checked the files you've reported as not opening, but they opened  
here, so let's try the following: please click on the folder's link,  
and when you're taken to the list of files, right-click the file  
you're interested in and then click Download. It could be that because  
the files are quite large, Google Drive refuses to display them  
without you downloading them first.  
Here's a bit of information about the parallel proverb books. It's a  
compilation made by Kazys Grigas of proverbs that have  
(near-)equivalents in other languages. He displays the proberb and its  
variations in the various languages the proverb exists in. A large  
number of these proverbs have English equivalents, so knowledge of  
German isn't important.
