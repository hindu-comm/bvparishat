Just to clarify what kind of studies I'm after.  
Word similarities, while interesting, don't mean that the languages  
themselves are similar. Word isn't a unit of the language, sentence  
is. An interesting similarity is where a long and nontrivial sentence  
in the source language, when translated virtually verbatim,  
corresponds to a fairly well-formed sentence in the target language.
