I've searched for Introduction to Lithuanian written by three American  
authors, but so far the book that came the closest is Introduction to  
Modern Lithuanian by Dambriunas, Klimas, Schmalstieg, 1966. They may  
not be American, but at the time of writing the book all three were  
lectureres at US universities.  
Could this be the one?  
  
Best wishes,  

Irene
