Dear Professor Wakankar,

  

Thank you for the references, I’ll try to locate these books. The first book will probably be easier to find than the second.

More worrying is the fact that I don’t seem to have any emails from you. I’ve checked the to-do list of emails to which I haven’t yet replied because I’m still researching the topic, and yours wasn’t among them.

Please accept my apologies and, if possible, resend the message.

  

Best wishes,

Irene
