It's not just Slovenian. I can report that learning Sanskrit became  
much easier when, instead of being limited to English translations, I  
began translating Sanskrit into Russian word for word. The outcome was  
pretty serviceable Russian sentences. Smirnov and Elizarenkova also  
remarked on this many years ago.
