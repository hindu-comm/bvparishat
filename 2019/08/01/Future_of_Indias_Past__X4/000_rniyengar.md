*Effect of Precession of Earth’s Axis as deciphered from Sanskrit Texts*

After my IJHS paper in 2011 on the Pole Star Dhruva attracted considerable attention of scholars interested in Ancient India, Vedas, Chronology etc I am continuously updating my research by adding new information. This was presented as an invited talk:

"Archaeo-astronomy and Ancient Indian Chronology"in the National Conference “Indian History-Emerging Perspectives, 5-7 March 2018”, at ICHR New Delhi. ICHR is supposed to bring out the Proceedings of the Conference, but when!! I hope the future of India’s past is secure in the hands of ICHR and the like.

Interested members can access my paper prepared in December 2018:

I will add revisions and improvements as and when they happen.
