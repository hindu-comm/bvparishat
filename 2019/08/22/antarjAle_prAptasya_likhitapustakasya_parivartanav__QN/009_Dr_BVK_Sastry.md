Namaste Jaya Prakash,



On \< **to my surprise its OCRed text was completely correct unicode Kannada** \> :





1. See highlighted : ??? I presume you have the Devanagari edition and also the original text. There are more errors than pointed out by V.Subramanyam ji.

 Yogananda ji can further highlight the technology issues here.



Samskruth language document, and more specifically Rig-Veda is too precious to allowed dilution with OCR errors.



**Given a choice to teach the Rig-Veda First Sukta- Opening Mantra, do you think traditional schools and Samskruth linguists would accept / even give credibility to these OCR Errors ? This is not the place for me to detail on the ' Errors in Print-publications and second editions ( without proofing) within India, in almost all languages in the name of
'Vedas' ! Even if the reference were to be taken as the Satwalekar edition, Swadhyaya Mandal, Sampoornaananda, Delhi publishers and the rest. **

****

**The shortfall lies in (a) Failure to cross check the print with the voice tradition ( which is said to have been meticulously followed in Nirnaya Sagar editions and earlier Calcutta editions). **

****

**While the technology-Convenience has become better, the processing- publishing tools have improved, the same also have the nodes of newer forms of errors cropping up. **



***My Question***: When the whole world looks for 'Veda-Studies' as 'Hindu Sacred Scriptures' , Would vedic text -content extracted through such OCR to be used to build a course model of Vedic studies-101 on the basis of Holy Bible ? Would that the relevant or reasonable or right ?



As for academician is concerned, Where will the academician find the ' qualified auditor' who would be ' qualified enough' to filter the OCR errors and align the voice-text of Sayana's original commentary to OCR? Sayanas manuscripts itself has been critically tampered and edited by Prof. Max Muller, casting serious doubts on every vedic school of traditional vedic commentaries ? very specifically 'Sringeri tradition'. Please read the introduction of Max Muller to Sayana Commentary based Rigveda and the principles of Textual editing adapted leaning towards the western model of critical editions !



As for tradition itself, and technology issues for voice -transcription are concerned, Is there a ' True voice Transcription in Devanagari Character set , with accents'? Over reliance on some practical technology for voice to text / OCR from a document has to find itself a ' human role model and intervention mechanism' to correct the imprecise linguistic expression and output to correct text output.



The warning from Narayana Prasad, highlighted below needs heeding.



Regards

BVK Sastry
