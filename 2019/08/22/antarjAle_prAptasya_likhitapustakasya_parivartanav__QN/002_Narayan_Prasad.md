Sir,

 Namaste.

 

 Please try this website -[https://ocr.sanskritdictionary.com/#](https://ocr.sanskritdictionary.com/#)- it gives better results for Sanskrit. Best is to do theOCRone image at a time, since the pdf is also converted to image and then each page is OCRed when you click on it.

 But this will require editing.

 The text file from [archive.org](http://archive.org) is not meant for Sanskrit. Even if the text is prepared, that will be done assuming Roman characters in the scan, hence junk will be the result.

  Regards

  Narayan Prasad
