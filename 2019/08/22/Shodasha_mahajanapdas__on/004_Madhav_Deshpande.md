I did not design this map. It is one of the several maps of these Mahajanapadas available on Google Images, and I am sure they come from different publications, and one would need to consult those publications about how each of them came up with their own lists and maps. My impression is that there are different lists of these Janapadas in Buddhist and Jain literature and elsewhere, with some variation among these lists. A good beginning may be B. C. Law's book *Geography of Early Buddhism*. Here is the link to the pdf of this book:
