Dear Deshpande-ji

How were the relative locations and extents of the Janapadas determined ?. Did they exist together.

I do not see Banga and Kalinga along with Anga.

Very interesting find and waiting for more information.

Did these Jana padas use the same language

Thanks and best regards

Deva
