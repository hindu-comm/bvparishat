The reference has a lot of valuable information will be of help to those interested in ancient Indian history. It is interesting that the chinese traveller identified India as Shin-Toh -- Shindhu, a river. That makes sense as there were so many units or Janapadas. Later on kings or emperors rules over bigger areas. Like Ashoka, king of Magadha and Kkaravela, king of Kalinga.

I did find reference to Vanga and Kalinga in this book.

Thanks.

Best Regards

Deva
