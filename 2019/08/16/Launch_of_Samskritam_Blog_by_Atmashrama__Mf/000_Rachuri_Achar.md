Dear Scholars,

   Atmashrama is pleased to launch a blog on Sanskrit on the auspicious occasion of Shravana Paurnima celebrated as Sanskrit Day across the globe. We humbly bow to all scholars and pray for their blessings for the success of this small effort to spread the fragrance of Divine Samskritam. Kindly spread the word among your students, friends and sanskrit lovers. The blog can be accessed at the following link.
