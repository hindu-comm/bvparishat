Prof. Paturi has drawn attention to the essential issue.

The Nicene Creed, which no Christian can disavow, states all this explicitly, in ruthless detail.

The problem is not just with Christianity, but is with its more ghastly junior, Islam, too.

Their avowed policy towards others viz. "Convert, or get killed"  

is at the root of the twin scourges of humanity.  

Killing "the other", you go to heaven - is what they are officially *taught*, after all!  

  

Al Taqiyya, the 'art' of *cheating in order to convert* is common to both.

The tragedy, or rather the evil, is that it is ***scripturally ordained*.**

  

How can these two predator religions ever be at peace with others?

A rhetorical question, indeed.

  

For them, peace is the time for the preparation for the next war.

Euphemism Extreme that they are religions of Love and Peace!

  

Verily verily I say unto you : they spell  

the love of the praying mantis, and the peace of the grave.
