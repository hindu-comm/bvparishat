The translation is not unreasonable.  
  
The makers of this site have this to say (see their FAQ section at the bottom of the page):  

  
"The general perception among missionares who were also Sanskrit scholars was so: “Such, indeed, is the exuberance and flexibility of Sanskrit language and its power of compounding words that it will probably be found, next to Hebrew and Greek, the most expressive vehicle of Christian truth.”  
In other words, “the translated text in Sanskrit is as if the original Greek and Hebrew texts are looking in a mirror. The meanings are not at all lost, but are enhanced.”  
  
The above reason alone is good enough to substantiate this endeavour of Bible in Sanskrit. What it says is that, out of all the thousands of Bible translations (full Bible in 554 and portions in 2,932 languages), the Sanskrit translation is the only one that has preserved or even enhanced the meaning of the original text. It is as if the Hebrew and Greek texts have found their long lost twin sister in Sanskrit texts. Should we say more! "
