The translation seems suspect -  

starting from the very title.

  

The word bible means only "book" - speaking etymologically

\- as evidenced even in words such as *biblio-graphy/biblio-phile/biblio-mania* etc.

Contrastively, "Veda" means "Knowledge".

*Bible* can only be translated as *pustakam.*  

  

To translate a word that means a mere book as "Satya Veda"  

is not only unadulterated nonsense, but plain mischief

(look at the audacity of the unwarranted adjective):

plainly meant to imply "You may have the veda; but we have the *true* veda"!

(By implication, yours is a false veda).  

  

These brazen proselytizers who pontificate on "tolerance" and "equality of religions",

and have a track record of destroying numerous cultures all through history,

just want to desecrate everything. Nothing else.
