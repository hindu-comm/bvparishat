Rightly said, Kannan Ji.



In fact the entire Mathura wasn't bad. But the minority aka Kamsa literally ran roughshod over the good majority. This, historically, went on happening world over. Every other civilization were made to bite dust. Except India where Somnath kept on resurrecting.Being 'sanatanattwam', its Swaroopa, the Tree with the fruits will ever stand and the tree fellers will keep up, their efforts like the Godot's wait !

  

Probably it is a 'pRabala pRArabdha', which calls for much stronger handling.
