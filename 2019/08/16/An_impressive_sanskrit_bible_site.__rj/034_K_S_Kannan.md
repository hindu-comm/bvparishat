For all his good will, and high education, it is a pity that Prof. Bijoy Misra  

did not know the unabashed declarations of Monier Williams and Max Muller,

even the most famous names to reckon with.

  

If we fail to notice their overt declarations and proud proclamations,

how are we to know what they do subversively and by subterfuge?

  

This is how we enjoyed slavery for a thousand years.
