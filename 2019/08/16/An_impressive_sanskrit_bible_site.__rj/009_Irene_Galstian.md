Thank you, Professor Kannan, I'll look that one up and try to find it.  
The book I was writing about had only the first 9 or so chapters  
translated, and these had to do with Vedic literature. Maybe it's the  
same book.  
Katre's book was originally written in English, then translated into  
Sanskrit, so it contains a fairly large number of ordinary English  
sentences rendered into Sanskrit.
