\< believe that God speaks in Sanskrit, then the Bible must be in Sanskrit - that was the main purpose of the Monier Williams dictionary.

I didn't know this. After the 2001 event in the US, there were efforts in churches to educate people on different faiths

and religions. I was invited to a big Catholic church called Glastonbury Abbey In Hingham, MA, run by Benedictine monks.  

I had chosen to speak on "Hindu Prayers". The Church grounds were lovely, overlooking the Atlantic Ocean. I loved the  

audience and engaged them in various chanting. During the Q&A, a person (linked with our Divinity School) raised hand  

and asked the seemingly innocent question "Which language does God speak?"

I replied "God has no language. He knows our heart." There was stunned silence in the room.

I did quip "God is reading our hearts."

This was 2003 Oct. There may be a video in the Catholic archives.  

  

I should also mention that I had the opportunity to listen to Gregorian chant by Father Nicholas in the service

before we went to the lecture. His devotion and care in articulation impressed me to create tutorial on chanting

as I did. <https://www.glastonburyabbey.org/> Father Nicholas is the pastor with the stick.
