Namaste

1. The challenge of translation across language is a widely debated topic. There are scholars who hold vehemently to the extreme views :
'Translation is murder' to ' Translation is a re-birth of an idea across languages crossing the barriers'. The colonial dictionaries of Sanskrit -english, which have contributed greatly to preserve the vocabulary of Brahmi language families have also cast a dark shadow in understanding the meaning of the terms. The oldest bible translation to Sanskrit has much to be reviewed and corrected.

If one truly follows the Bible Sanskrit translation , it will position Christianity as one of the ' Guru - model streams under Puranas of Hinduism! This would not be acceptable to either Hindus or Christians ! The Samskruth terms used to map Biblical concepts to Vedic model are like a double edged knife for both the religions.

2. As the thread has already brought in the reference to Bible translation, the pointing to the link [*https://joshuaproject.net/assets/media/handouts/bible-translation-status.pdf*](https://joshuaproject.net/assets/media/handouts/bible-translation-status.pdf), an ongoing global exercise may not be out of context to mention here.
When it comes to evangelistic work and translation of ' Gods words' reaching out to society through the 'Tongue of People', Papacy has held extreme positions on what need to be the standards of translation, motive and guidance, the stand on official language of the Church for Religion -ritual needs for mediating between humans and 'Gods (?!). The 'magic of language' that enabled mortals to speak to people on the other side of ' River of death'- as seen in Ulysses at Hades ' (Homers Epic) , Hamlets speaking to ghosts ( Shakespeare) was lost way back and religion teams pushed this as 'witch-language and witch craft'. Even now, Papacy is reluctant to talk about ' language magic- miracles - sorcery' and the like; and keeps the talk on early Greek and (Koine ) Latin translations of Old Testament in a hush-hush wraps!

3. There is a clear difference between ' motives in translation (Bhashaa-antarana, anu-vaada)' and 'building popular re-narrated versions ( punar-niroopana, kathaa, pravachana,) of scripture in peoples tongues for a reach out effort'. The purpose and audience are different. The investors are also different in these projects !

 There are plenty of examples for good, bad , worst on both sides. If one is considered as ghastly, then the other side is equally guilty of the same error.



4. For academic debate and scholarly research, the challenge of ' language' and 'translation' is handled in Samskruth tradition in a specific way. This ' indigenous linguistic theory' for ' Indian languages' is a subject theme for research and falls out of formal academic research in colonial and oriental studies.

Indian language families are classifiable in to four large segments as below, for the purpose of translation consideration.

**4a) Totally Non-Translatable** **Indic languages** : The examples are 'Darshana' like 'Vedas', which are considered transcendental. The
'language of Vedas ' is technically called 'Chandas' ( Brahmi, Bharati, sarasvati, Vak, Accented Sanskrit ?). This is a-historical, transcendental, mystic, not locked to any human of any period. The deliberation on this needs consciousness layers related discussion. This is not an element or a factor in academic indology and linguistics !
The simple clear term is ' A-Paurusheya', (translated as 'Vedic Language of a migrating tribals, and historical society saved by a God, an academic axiom basic to all IE linguistics) , is a concept that does not exist in Old Testament anchored linguistics and traditions anywhere. The closest concept for this is ' Logos' - In the beginning, there was Word,.... and Word was God ( John), which does not need a ' Jesus of Nazareth' as a savior under religion language model.

**4b) Lim****i****ted T****ranslatable** **Indic languages****:** This is 'Deva-Bhashaa' also known now as 'Classical Sanskrit, Paninian language, literary Sanskrit, Hybrid Sanskrit, Buddhist sanskrit' ! This is a language with unknown antiquity, integrally connected with 'Chandas' and a derivative of Chandas. The relation between Chandas- Bhashaa can be compared to the (Para-Brahma- Devataa)- ( Transcendental Divine - Gods(Devas )- Parabrahma of Upanishads - Brahma deva of Trimurthy in puranas.

**4c) Fairly translatable and Root connectable to Bhashaa** **-** **Indic language****:** These are called the Prakruts and Apabhramshas. These are Sanskrit Bhashaa- derivatives which becomes prakruths; Prakrtuh derivatives which become apabhramsha; apabhramsha derivatives
which become Mlecchita and Desi. i.e. This is the largest chunk of Social Historical languages which are emerging out of a ' Proto- source', the nature of which is partially traceable . But not understood fully.

What is called today's English, is a far removed derivative in this chain in the Greek- Latin - ....stream. The connection of English to Chandas and Bhashaa are very difficult in translation.

**4d) Encrypted** **Indic languages** of **Brahmi** **family**: These are technically called 'dramidam' ( or more technically the Siddha-Bhashaa, in contrast to 'Yoga-Bhashaa' classification of Brahmi family of languages). These are Chandas and Bhashaa- encryptions which becomes discipline and teaching context specific. Many classical south Indian languages come uder this category. These encrypted languages are also collocated with 'Bhashaa' and carry their own grammars. These are languages of communities which follow Siddha-Yogi's teachings. These are ' Proto- sourced' to Chandas and Bhashaa. The encryption nature of Dramidams to Brahmi are called ' Tatsama-Tadbhava' formations. These are again rule based; different from Bhashaa- Prakrut paradigm of connection. This is native linguistics of Indian languages with in Indian (Bharateeya) landscape. This part of Indian Language - analytics is not welcome in IE linguistics, as it makes the Indo-Aryan language narrative and OT origin for Indian languages to become redundant.
