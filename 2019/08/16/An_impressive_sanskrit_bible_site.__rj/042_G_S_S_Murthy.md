Respected Scholars and lovers of Sanskrit,

It is with some hesitation that I am expressing my views.

This august forum sometimes moves away from its main, as I believe, objective of discussing all aspects associated with Sanskrit and texts in Sanskrit. Because of the nature of Sanskrit texts, Sanatana dharma becomes an integral part of any discussion.

All said and done, Western scholars have contributed immensely in helping English-educated Indians recognize the richness of Sanskrit and Sanskrit texts. The scholars got funds from Christian sources and even the most reluctant scholar had to somehow justify the utility of his work for the propagation of Christianity. It could be a pure survival strategy. Missionary zeal which is so evident in the Preface of a work rarely raises its head in the main work. This is my impression.

Thanks and regards,

Murthy
