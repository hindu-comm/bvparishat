Shreevatsa,  
  
I have somewhere a Sanskrit translation of a book by Macdonell on  
Sanskrit literature and Katre's book on Indian textual criticism.  
These are collection of neutral narrative sentences for the most part.  
Please reply if you'd like me to find these files and share them with  
you.  
  
Irene
