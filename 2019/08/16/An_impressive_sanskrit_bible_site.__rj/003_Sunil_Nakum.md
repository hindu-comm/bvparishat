Dear All,

  

Without going into much details of it's authenticity, the sender "***ken p***" of this link reminded me someone we are all familiar with in BVP. I'm not providing any link of the replies sent by this person/bot but at certain point of time he/she/it used to send replies to almost every email on the thread. Many members had raised concerned about his/her/it's authenticity but AFAIK there was no reply by him. Most replies were just out of first few links from relevant google search links. I assume this member is already been removed from BVP, since there is no typical reply after January 2019.  

  

So without wasting your valuable time in looking or even clicking such links. My simple suggestion would be to ask the administrator of the group to remove this member or investigate who/why someone does it (since yours is a group of programmers!)?  

  

Dhanyoshmi,

Sunil
