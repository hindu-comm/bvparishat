Professor Kannan,

  

With regard to your statement "I do not know whose scores are more ...the no. of people killed by Christians/Muslims/Marxists of various hues", while I would be happy to be pointed to (by anyone who is aware of) either a more authoritative or more comprehensive database than Matthew White's*[The Great Big Book of Horrible Things: The Definitive Chronicle of History's 100 Worst Atrocities](https://www.amazon.com/Great-Big-Book-Horrible-Things/dp/B012HTRI24)*, until then, here are some excerpts that might be relevant to your point:

1.  ‘ONE HUNDRED DEADLIEST MULTICIDES’ got ‘455 million killed overall’. 2.  Of that 445 million, ‘IDEOLOGICAL MULTICIDES’ (32 in total:
    ref. p. 549) accounted for 142 million 3.  This is further broken down as ‘RELIGION: 47 million’ (13 of the 32
    above), ‘COMMUNISM: 67 million’ (6 of 32) and ‘RED-WHITE CIVIL WARS:
    26 million’ (6 of 32).

On p. 529, where White ranks the 100 deadliest multicides, one finds the following:  

>
