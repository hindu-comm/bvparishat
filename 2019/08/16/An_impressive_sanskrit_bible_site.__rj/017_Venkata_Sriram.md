Our maidservant was devotee of shirdi saibaba....later she got converted into Christianity as the local pastor told her that Jesus & Baba were brothers and Jesus was elder one and more powerful !

  

She told us the truth when we insisted her for the reason of getting converted . ...All these gullible, innocent & ignorant folk are being taken for ride by the pastors & fathers who are brainwashing them by saying that hindu gods emanated from Jesus and hindu literature was being copied by Bible !

  

I don't understand one thing ! Why can't the christians be 'good christians' by following their own dharma of prayers without poking their nose in somebody's affairs ! Why the hell they have to go to such extent of cheating the innocent people ! By doing this, what are they achieving ultimately....are they not cheating themselves

  

rgs,

sriram
