Namaste.

Christianity should not be put on the same footing as Islam or Marxism; despite its flaws Christianity has been a net plus for humanity.

Not waging wars - I don't see this as some kind of virtue. Even an intellectual pursuit in my opinion is - has to be - a shadow of a real war. Lack of this attitude is seen in R&D across domains - Defence included - in India. If you can't increase productivity of people then why have the universitites and the R&D centers?

One more personal observation:  
With purushartha, a person is able to take one quantum leap in one life-time. I've never seen a good Muslim evolve into a Hindu in a single lifetime; but I've seen a good Christian evolve into a Hindu in one lifetime. For the former it is two leaps and impossible, whereas for the latter it is one leap and possible.

And yes I do believe in all that - sanatana, alternate reality, vishva-guru, etc.
