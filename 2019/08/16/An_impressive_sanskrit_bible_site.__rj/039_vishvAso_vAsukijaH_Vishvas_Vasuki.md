I am glad that shrI kaNNan seems to refute the popular "we're sanaatan" fallacy - "Being 'sanatanattwam', its Swaroopa, the Tree with the fruits will ever stand and the tree fellers will keep up, their efforts like the Godot's wait ". It is one thing to be vanishing refugees/ survivors like Yezidis or Parsis or zeme Heraka - but that's hardly like the "tree" surviving - more like some neglected twig hanging on to life. Typically, elites of pagan societies hit by the corpse cult (Romans, Egyptians or Greeks) realize the danger too late to take consistent decisive action (Japan being a rare exception).  
  
There are several other popular strains of typical Hindu fallacies (vishva-guru-syndrome, alternate reality syndrome), which I hope get similar counterpoints :-)
