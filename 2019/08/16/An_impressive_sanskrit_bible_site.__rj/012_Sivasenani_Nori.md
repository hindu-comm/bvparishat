Sir

  

The stance of tanslators of Bible is that the message is what needs to be translated; and often words in source language are replaced by equivalent words in the culture of the destination language. Thus, a lamb is translated as 'baby seal' when translated to languages of the Arctic as baby seal is the equivalent of lamb in the Arctic.

  

So this is a deliberate act by Bible translators to use Satya Veda. Even the choice of language is strategic. If Indians believe that God speaks in Sanskrit, then the Bible must be in Sanskrit - that was the main purpose of the Monier Williams dictionary. And these objectives are pursued by evangelical institutions spanning across generations.

  

Regards

N Siva Senani
