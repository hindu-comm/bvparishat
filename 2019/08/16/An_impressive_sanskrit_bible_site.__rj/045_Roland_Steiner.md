No comment, but a simple question to the moderators and the members of  
the advisory board of this list:  
  
Are the last postings of Dr. K.S. Kannan to this tread  
-- <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/bvparishat/rjot0EVGvxM> --  
in accordance with the rules of the BVP?  
  
  
R. Steiner (German Indologist and "moderated" member, for whatever reason)
