Prof Kannan,  

I agree. I am not conversant with the writing of either MW or Max Mueller.

i didn't have an opportunity to study them.  

Now I know, but I avoid.  

  

When I was asked in 2003, I had zero idea that it was a prevailing

discussion among the missionaries.

  

I do avoid many of the half-baked writings, which I see are only correlations.

I do see their circulation through media and otherwise. There is a heavy

amount of colonial interpretation which we must totally reject!  

All must join hands in boycotting useless literature.

  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
