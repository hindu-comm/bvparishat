The book by Dr Katre on Textual Criticism was translated in Sanskrit by,I think, Dr.Viroopaksha Jaddipal from Tirupati.



It is a very good attempt to put the English of Dr. Katre in a little bit simple Sanskrit which could be understood by those who know only Sanskrit and are not so familiar with English.
