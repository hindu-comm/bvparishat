What minority and majority are you speaking of, Mr. Balagopal?  

The systematic genocide the Vatican and the Arab Nationalism are wreaking overtly and covertly

is an open book. The cultural and intellectual genocide they have specialised in are so designed as to *never* come to a halt.

Their agenda is fixed : it may only assume various allotropic forms.

And as they say, the more they change, the more they remain the same :

"There was but one true Christian, and he was crucified"  

  

Statistics must be easily available as to how many countries have already been doomed to Christianity,

and how many damned to be Islamic. (Alternatively, study population-wise ie. in terms of percentage of world population).

  

To destroy others, changing their demography is the chief weapon.

That is why democracy is paramount!

  

If we do not wake up at least now, the world will be witness to internecine bloodbaths  

\- between whom ? : only Christians and Muslims, both contenders for Jerusalem.  

And wars do not decide who is right, only who is left.

Of course, they have company in Leftists (they will feel left out if left unmentioned).

I do not know whose scores are more - the competion is so fierce! :

the no. of people killed by Christians/Muslims/Marxists of various hues.

  

All this is, however, not to say that there are no sane voices here and there among them.
