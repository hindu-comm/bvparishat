Carey extensively discussed his translation with pundits and made sure  
that the meaning is as correct as possible considering the difference  
in languages. Still, he was a missionary, and that showed. Perhaps  
it's best to skip the New Testament, except maybe the Gospel of Mark  
and try his Old Testament in Sanskrit. There are more stories there of  
narrative rather than polemic nature.
