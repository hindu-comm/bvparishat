Namaste



In the context of discussion invoking the name of Monier Williams - \< Christianity- Sanskrit- bible \> one may prefer to read the following book: Brahminism and Hinduism : Religious thought and life in India
(1891 publication)

This will help in understanding how oriental anchor of bearings of History and how long ' Orientalists have pushed this agenda on Sanskrit studies in India. It is going beyond the 'unabashed declaration', motives and ' lamentation on past'. It is about the strategy, persistent work, and apathy of Home teams in swallowing the sugar coated 'poison pills' ! and passing it on as ' authentic for post independence India'.



Lot more water has passed below the bridge over a century. **The scholars of pre-internet era need to answer why they could not educate the generations on these strategies and counter these studies ?**
There are many more resources like this, which has impacted the 'Core of vedic Tradition and Samskruth studies'. The accident has taken place. the choice is straight forward and clear: 



Wake up, stop bashing the old dead horse. Show how the traditions are useful for good living globally in 21st century. Is this not the pooja samkalpa one recites to stand by ?

and the vedic wish -' Bhardam shrunuyama , vyashema devahitam yadaayuh'.



What is the model of Loka-hita from Vedic tradition is what needs to be
implemented to answer MW challenge observations .

One needs to answer what Dr. Ambedkar raised the issues, building his thoughts on Monier Williams and team's writings, in **Who Were The Shudras** - by B. R. Ambedkar (Year-1946 ) Free downloadable book at : <https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.282497>

For all his good will, and high education, it is a pity that Prof. Bijoy Misra did not know the unabashed declarations of Monier Williams and Max Muller,even the most famous names to reckon with.
