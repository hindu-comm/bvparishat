This thread seems to be going in all directions.

  

Intention of the thread initiating post , on the basis of what the initiating member posted later in the thread seems to be to focus on suitability of Sanskrit in translating from classical Greek and classical Hebrew sources such as the Greek and Hebrew versions of the Bible.

Prof. Kannan's immediate response was to the title of the book . " Satya Vedah" . He found it to be a wrong and misleading translation. Few can disagree with that observation.

  

The ensuing discussion was all about motivations behind such misleadingly wrong translations.

  

The focus of the thread initiation as mentioned above and this justifiable discussion triggered by the translation in the title are two different topics.

  

The thread is being closed.
