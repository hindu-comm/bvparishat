True, there are many traditionally trained people, some even orthodox, but they do not follow orthodox values, perhaps unwillingly udara-nimittam. Chinmaya ashram, and many others, are traditional but not orthodox, be it in Veda or Vedanta. What would be more relevant is:

1\) whether orthodox Veda centres teach anadhikArIs.

2\) if they do, more importantly, whether they let these very trained people participate in their own yAgas at their premises.

3\) whether people like you and me invite them as priests at our vedakAryas.

  

The reason I raise these questions is that I personally know an institution that teaches vedapATha to everyone as a part of a "broader initiative", but doesn't let them participate in their own yajnas! At the cost of being ridiculed, I consider this akin to ministers making policies to hand out medical degrees (for example) to those without merit, but never getting themselves treated by these doctors!

  

Kind rgds,
