If you recite Rudram yourself, you know that breath control takes a while to develop. Sure, if a ritual is performed reciting like this girl does, the intensity most likely will be insufficient to create, but still, the greatest power is always with Siva. Only He can accept or reject an oblation brought before Him in any form. If you look at the girl carefully, you’ll see that in certain instants she already experiences the energy directly, so Siva seems to disagree with you. If she continues, these instants of union get more and more numerous, and after a few years the required state for optimal state for recitation is entered into very quickly.
