Yes, Dr Malavi Hari, self-admission can backfire in a number of ways, of course you are right. But ask yourself, is this the key sentiment you perceive in the criticisms of this girl? Ask yourself this: if an Indian girl was in this video reciting exactly as the Japanese girl does, would the criticisms still be in the same vein? Witness also how a connection has been made between a Vedic hymn and worldly songs, however famous. The trouble here seems to be with an excessive feeling of ‘us’ and ‘them’, ‘mine’ and ‘yours’. Perhaps this is a sign of a certain insecurity, and this is understandable, but it’s just not possible to isolate Siva into Indian and non-Indian parts any more than it’s possible to isolate Indian and non-Indian oxygen. For the devotee, the deity is the beloved that outshines all else. For example, it’s not our pundit who brought Siva to me, patiently and painstakingly teaching detail after detail. It’s Siva Himself, who, this time in the shape of a pundit, beckoned me a little closer. The ecstatic joy of that is beyond words and can’t be trivialised.
