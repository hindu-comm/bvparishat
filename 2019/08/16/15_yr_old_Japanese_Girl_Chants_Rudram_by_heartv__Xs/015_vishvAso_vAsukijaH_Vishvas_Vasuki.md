Well, the answer is in your statement itself. You say "our" ancient texts (implying communal guardianship, if not ownership), which imples that only "we" (the guardians) are exactly the ones to safeguard it. If she were chanting her daddy's copyrighted song, that would be up to her.

shabarimala sannidhAnam is an exclusive sacred space under the stewardship of ayyappa-s cult (led by its tantrin). ("As it is in a diverse, polytheist society, every group of Hindus, has a general right to create its own traditions and develop an exclusive ritual space for its own needs. The rural traditions centred around their local, village pantheons as well as the tribal systems had their own separate, sacred spaces.")  
You want to disregard the express wishes of the deity shAstR (as revealed through deva-prashna-s) and welcome everyone from mensturating women to giddy druggies, you should start your own temple (for all the loka-kalyANa it will accomplish). I for one strongly prefer temples run strictly as per divine Agama-s rather than some idiot's fancies.  

  

I am reminded of these words:  
- "This is how our ritual spaces work and something I hope can be drilled into the heads of the judges who have no erudition about our religion. The deity’s nature (in Southern Agamika & tAntrika temples, this is based on the mantra-s installed in the deity’s icon/vigraha), location of deity’s shrine, nature of rituals done, type of priesthood, kind of food and flower offerings made to deity, nature of people who come to the temple, colors of garments worn by the deity, priests & devotees & many other factors all have to cohere with one another as far as possible. All these factors come together to create a coherent “ritual reality”, which is the ultimate fruit a sincere worshiper truly yearns for. The deity’s presence becomes fully manifest and becomes a source of blessings for the worshipers and their families. Different Agama-s and tantra-s have their own versions of the “ritual reality” or “ritual universe” they are asking the priests and others to enact on this earth."  

\- "When you participate in a religion, you do so, not only by doing what you are obligated to do, or doing something optional but allowed for you, but also by not doing what is prohibited. ..."  

  

I must say: even our illiterate uneducated but highly cultured maid happily understands and appreciates all this, while allegedly educated people don't.
