Your devotion to lord Shiva is most welcome and no one can or will stand between you and shiva. However, chanting the Rudra is not the only way to manifest your shivabhakti. No one is going to object if you join us in reciting 'shambho Mahadeva deva' or 'shivoham shivoham'. You have perceived the message wrong. The objection is NOT to a foreigner reciting the rudram. The retaliation is for a ineligible person reciting it. The objection would be with the same force, if not more, if an Indian had been in the same place, be it a girl or a boy. If a particular person has had all the necessary samskaras performed, he is eligible for the Veda mantras. If not, he is not eligible. Even in the modern school hierarchy developed admirably by the West (hope you catch my sarcasm here), even in the most primary level, you expect a child to clear nursery to get admitted into primary school. This being the case, how do you expect the best form of education to be without any prerequisites?

It beats me, why the Western world is always keen on working out an equal status for men and women. Indians are very clear here - men have been and continue to be the roti or rice-winners (not bread-winners), women have been and will be roti or rice-makers. So is the case for Veda adhyayana. The eligible male member does Veda adhyayana, the female facilitates this Veda adhyayana in her own ways, but does not do Veda adhyayana directly. The reason for this may be numerous, but, here is one -shauca and continuous learning are extremely essential for Veda adhyayana, which is not possible for a woman. No ghanapaathin dislikes his wife, in fact, he has great affection for her, but still, does not try at all to make her a ghanapaathinii... Does this mean he doesn't like or respect her? It is extremely detrimental to health for a woman to recite the Veda mantras with vigour.

There is scope for thousands of things for women to do. It is mere obstinacy to compete for Veda adhyayana.

Also, you are right when you say Indians have this feeling of insecurity. So would you if some one comes to your house as a friendly guest, then slowly starts taking away your possessions and on top of all this, starts proclaiming that it is his and you are the intruder. The publication of articles in this vein by Western scholars is not new to us. The Aryan theory, Indo-European language classification etc are extended imaginations of the west, the scholars there just proclaim something and repeated proclamations make them illusory truths, which indians, being ignorant, start reading with full momentum and slog their hearts out for nothing fruitful. Naturally, the west will be ahead if indian values are to be read in English. This is exactly the reason why we are discouraged from reading our texts through samskrta, this is the reason why massively funded projects are on the move for translating samskrta works to English etc. One more thing here, some words are deliberately translated loosely so as to distort the meaning, but, without creating unrest. Sorry, we have the right to object if we find intruders.

Dr. Malavi Hari
