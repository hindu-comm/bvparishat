Not just *a Raj Kapoor song*.

  

A Turkish boy, less than 15 years of age, is singing the famous iconic Raj Kapoor song.

  

I just thought of this BVP thread while listening to his rendition, and the nuances of whether the boy was singing it correctly, lilting when not needed, or if the power of the vagabond Raj Kapoor could be felt in the voice of Mukesh, and of course, who am I to even think such thoughts.

  

\[ PS: I hope the group has not lost its sense of humor yet. I reserved my comments on the Japanese girl, since an example is better than thousand explanations. \]  

  
  

Thanks,
