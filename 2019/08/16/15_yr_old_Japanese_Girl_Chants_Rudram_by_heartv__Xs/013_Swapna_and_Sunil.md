Dear all,

  

The video is very impressive. If chanting our ancient texts brings the 15 year old close to Shiva, then who are we to offer diktats and decrees? All offers of support to the 15 year old.

In this regard, I find Ms. Galstain's words singularly eloquent when she says "Please don't try to outsource Shiva's job to anyone else: it's harder than it looks."

This applies to the Shabarimala Sannidhanam reference too.. If women want to visit theSannidhanam (menstruating or not), all power to them!!!

  

My humble truth.

  

Sunil
