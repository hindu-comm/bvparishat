There are still many Lady Purohitas in Pune, Mumbai etc.who are respectfully invited for Paurohitya, mainly because, they seem to be more serious and meticulous than some of the males.Their community is increasing and they are invited in other parts of India also,wherever the Maharashtrians have gone.
