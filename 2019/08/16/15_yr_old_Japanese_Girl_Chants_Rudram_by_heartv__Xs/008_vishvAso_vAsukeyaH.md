Not saying anything one way or another, but I disagree with this overextended non-judgementism. An analogy. Recently, our illiterate housemaid's phone started ringing with that badly sung bhajan-ified sacred gAyatri mantra. I promptly informed her that it is contrary to shAstra-s and noble tradition; and helped her install some alternate god-song. The Lord Shiva who has given these mantra-s has also given shAstra-s and mental faculties so that we may (hopefully) judge well and prosper.
