Very glad that a few, but only a few, have expressed their views in this thread frankly and favourably. Just one thing I would like to say - thousands of Indian girls would do the same thing, if not better, if just closing the eyes and chanting the mantras by heart will suffice. 'Please ask a fully trained Veda vidvan to comment on this. He is actually the one who is fit to judge such acts.' My question is this - does this person satisfy all the prerequisites laid down for doing veda-adhyayana or chanting the Veda mantras? First of all, has she had her upanayana samskara, which is the basic prerequisite for learning or chanting a vedamantra? If this point will be objected thus - 'why should we bother to stick on to what the maharshis said? Who said upanayana samskara is essential for Veda chanting?', the reply is this - a person who is not least bothered about the eligibility criteria laid down for a particular course will definitely not be really interested in the course matter too, or, if they are interested, but, happen to transgress the rules and obtain self-admission, they will fail miserably. This doesn't stop with their failure alone. The real students' progress is curbed when those who don't match the eligibility criteria join as co-students.

Without looking into all such details, commending such acts of foreigners has always been the greatest weakness of Indians. Pardon my impertinence. I do know that all of you in this group are scholars who deserve great respect. I also know such posts from me will tempt the governing body of the group to infringe me from the group. Nevertheless, am unable to control myself from posting this message. I again apologize for such impertinence, but, this is exactly why we succumb when the Western world attacks us culturally, without we Indians having the slightest idea that we are being attacked culturally.

  

Regards,

  

Dr. Malavi Hari.
