Namaste,

  

Not intending to get into the endless debate on the subject matter which has expanded, I am replying to the original post. Although its somehow okay to say that no one be the judge as to who should do what when it comes to shAstra-vishaya, its very well okay and even scholarly to sent judgments out on non-shAstra-vishaya. Why not let people do whatever they like in any field, especially law? As to shAstra, the purpose of chanting something or visiting temples has all to do with adRShTa dharma. One cannot just throw the anubandha-chAtuShTaya aside that has an adhikArI as well as phala, and do whatever one likes. Why not hand out PhDs and medicine degrees too to unqualified?! Even if you feel the empowered by the "power within", please do question the purpose. To think of monkeys when asked not to think about monkeys is the nature of the mind. Its a western concept to show the masses that a particular sect has been denied something, rather than to show that the same purpose can be attained by simpler means for some. The same shAstra that reveals the mantra, deity, etc, also reveals the adhikArI and saucha to follow. With ardhajaratIyanyAya, all that one can get is pApa. Of course, one may not care for that either.
