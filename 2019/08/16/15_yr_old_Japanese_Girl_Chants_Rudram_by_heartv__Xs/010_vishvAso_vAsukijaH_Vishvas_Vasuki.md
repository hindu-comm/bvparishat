Well, if "seeming to experience the energy" is the criterion for Shiva's approval or lackthereof, one might come to strange conclusions (lots of energetic performances in big evangelist meetings). Zoning oneself out is hardly the only yardstick for an incantation's beneficence (though that's important too). Also, I don't see how her "direct energy experience" is an indicator of shiva disagreeing with me that we ought to use shAstra-s and our mental faculties to form judgements. Ironically, you yourself are judging her to be on the right track.  

  

(All said, the video is quite impressive; only disagreeing with woo-woo-ism, because it is a dangerous path which can be extended to say things like: "let fertile women enter shabarimala; it's up to ayyappa to judge.")
