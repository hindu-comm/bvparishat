A few meta-comments:

\- I find the above misunderstanding quite remarkable (though perhaps not surprising in hindsight). I am pretty certain that every Indian on this thread caught the drift from the start. Perhaps we should be more explicit in the presence of interested foreigners?  

  

- I feel responses such as "Believe what you wish, Sir. I won’t debate this further." are quite rude and unwarranted. If you don't want to say anything, don't say anything (hat tip to <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0aWrDcM988> ) - one need not treat generic responses to a message on a public thread as a demand placed on its author.

  

- "Let it come from the heart, forget initiations" is an attitude that may well fit the rare "sarvAdhikArin" or the isolated student (alien or otherwise), but it must not be transformed to "Let's all transgress in public without shame and make a movement out of it" (example from today - <https://twitter.com/brakoo/status/1166893937203638272> ).
