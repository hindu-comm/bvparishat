The veda mantras are different from other forms of recitation like slokas. It creates a heat in the body by raising the Jataragni and may affect the woman chanting it. Whereas for men that heat converts the Veerya into Tejas. I have heard from women who chant rudram that their body is getting heated up. I told them to follow the Shastras. As per Shastras listening is OK and it gives the same effect of chanting.
