" Witness also how a connection has been made between a Vedic hymn and worldly songs"

  

Irene ji,

You mis-connected.

I didn't make connection between Vedic hymn and worldly song.

  

I made connection between a non-Indian teenager singing something Indian. I came across this video in one of the social media forums, and thought it was indeed humorous that there is a similar video (circumstance wise) which is generating lot of heat in this group. I did say that I hoped that the group had not lost its sense of humor.



Indians specially have the habit of going gaga over anything Indian that a non-Indian does, yoga, ayurveda, chanting, anything, even a simple Namaste will floor many.

I am not even going over the shAstric and other aspects.

I am just not a fan of over ga-ga-ing of anything.

  

And surely, it is a great deal for a Japanese girl to have done that rendition. From her reference point, the effort is immense, and commendable.

  

(Sorry if I reopened the thread, no intention to prolong anything)  
  

Thanks,  

\~ Shashi
