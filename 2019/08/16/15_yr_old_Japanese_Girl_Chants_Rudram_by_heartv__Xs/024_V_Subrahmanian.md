We should also take note of the fact that several decades ago Chinmaya Mission, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan and other institutions and several individuals trained traditionally in Vedic learning had started teaching the Veda to women and others who were not Brahmins. There was a 'movement' in some parts of Maharashtra and Karnataka to induct women Purohits and some families did get many rituals done by these women purohits. But this last initiative did not take off. But even now in Bangalore and other places there are Veda Pathashalas for girls. There are gurukulams for girls and the Mahila Vakyartha Sabha that presented a sadas in Udupi recently had girls coming from such institutions.
