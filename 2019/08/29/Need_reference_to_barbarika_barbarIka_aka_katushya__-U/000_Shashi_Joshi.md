Pranam all.

I am looking for some reference in MB itself about of Barbarika.

  

The wiki page <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khatushyam> talks about Khatu Shyam in Rajasthan. It doesn't give any exact excerpt for any of the references it mentions.

  

Is it possible for anyone to share some excerpts, or exact reference adhyaya/shloka etc for Barbarika, as older as possible.  

  
  

Thanks,  

\~ Shashi
