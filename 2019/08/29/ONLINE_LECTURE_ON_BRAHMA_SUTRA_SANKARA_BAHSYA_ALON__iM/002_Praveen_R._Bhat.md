Namaste,

For Hindi, pls check up with Kailashashram at Rishikesh directly as they do not have a website/online shop. Mostly the Mahamandaleshwara Sw. Divyanandaji there teaches Anandagiri Tika but there maybe one round across many that he may have done Bhamati as well. I see that someone has responded with Sw. TV, but AFAIK, he doesn't teach with any Tika.

  

Kind rgds,
