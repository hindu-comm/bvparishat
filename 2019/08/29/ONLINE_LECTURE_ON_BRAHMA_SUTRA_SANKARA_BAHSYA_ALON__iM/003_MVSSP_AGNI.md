Respected sir ,

          I saw that previously but that brahma sutra bhashya of swami tattvavidananda but it is in parts. No starting and no ending . I contacted a person who is attending classes under swami tattvavidananda and he told me that brahma sutra bhashya was not going from starting to ending. So there we got a problem and in search of audio/ videos for that.

  

I dont know about kailash ashram so i will search and will contact.

  

I saw that the arsha vidya gurukulam have a sale of hard disk of 3 years vedanta course of them but the cost of the hard disk is 25,000 and 27,000. And we can't effort that much of amount too.



I asked here so that some scholars who have links may share them or some may suggest the publisher of DVDs or CDs if they have it .



Thank you.
