Respected scholars,

 I have a friend who was in search of the brahma sutra sankara bhashya along with bhamati vyakhya lessons/videos withe rin C.D.s or in Pendrive etc.

He has a habit of reading bhagavadgita from 5 years and he now interested to have sravana of the brahma sutra sankara bahshya along with bhamati by listening to the audio.

The lanugae may be HINDI,ENGLISH,SANSKRIT or TELUGU.

He is fine in any if these four languages.
