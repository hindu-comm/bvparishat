Prof. Kannan-ji, Prof. Madhav Deshpande-ji, Prof. Siddharth Wakankar-ji, thank you all for the kind words and good wishes.

  

Prof. Deshpande-ji, as far as I know the books are currently available in Sahitya Akademi bookshops. You may please write to the Akademi ([sahityaak...@yahoo.com]()) to procure the book.

  

Thank you.

  

With warm regards,

R. Ganesh
