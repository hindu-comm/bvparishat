Dear Prof. Varakhediji,

  

Thanks a lot for this kind gesture. You are always kind to me. I must thank prof. Radhavallabh Tripathiji and Dr. Balram Shuklaji for their active concern andsupport. Of course, my friend Sri. Shashikiran has really worked hard in preparing the typed script along with proofreading and meeting other timely requirements. Many good friends and scholars like you have motivated and encouraged me with best wishes and all these nice gestures have accomplished this work of mine.

  

With utmost regards

  

Ganesh
