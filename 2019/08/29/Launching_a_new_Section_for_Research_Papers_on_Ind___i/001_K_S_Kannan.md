Highly commendable!

This will put many scholars on right track.

A basic malady with most Indians is - not writing much,

even when they have good ideas with them, &/or there is an important need to write

in order to dispel some current misconception etc..

  

This incentive can remedy it to some extent.

  

Bhoja used to give *aks"ara-laks"a.*

Our Academy is giving *pada-rUpyaka.*

Not a small amount, by any count!

  

Scholars should come forward to make use of this opportunity.
