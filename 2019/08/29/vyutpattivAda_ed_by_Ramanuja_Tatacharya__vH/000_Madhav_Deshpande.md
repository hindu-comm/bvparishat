Dear Colleagues,

  

  I just noticed that the cover page of the edition of Vyutpattivāda edited by Ramanuja Tatacharya \[published by the Kendriya Sanskrit Vidyapeeth, Tirupati\] says that this is a work of Gadādhara Bhaṭṭācārya; while inside it says: Vyutpattivāda of Gaṅgeśopādhyāya with Dīdhiti of Raghunātha Śiromaṇi and Dīdhiti-Prakāśikā by Gadādhara Bhaṭṭācārya. The text of the book is the standard text of the Vyutpattivāda of Gadādhara, and there are no commentaries of any sort.
The inside attribution of the work to Gaṅgeśa could simply be an error of some sort. Does this make sense? Perhaps the Naiyāyikas on the BVP could say something about this. With best regards,
