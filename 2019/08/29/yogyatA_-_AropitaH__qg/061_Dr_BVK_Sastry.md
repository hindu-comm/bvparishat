Namaste Bhat ji



The frame of discussion under this subject related post is expanding beyond the starting point and getting nested like noodles in many ways !



Bhat ji, You invoked ' Mahabhasya' reference of 'Vedic quote' from Patanjali addressing the question : Why Study Vyakaranam- ?'. This was
in response to Achyut Karve asking the intention behind
(vivakshaa) given expression ( in english): 'People have eyes yet they cannot see, they have ears but they cannot hear'. What does Patanjali intend to convey? Misra ji is asking the origin of the concept. This all centers around the debate of ' Veda-Shabda-artha -shakti' for which Vedanga tools are provided; and practice guidance given for upaasanaa in aaranyakas and yogopanishats. These are live traditions of Vak-Yoga-Samskrutham, under the wraps of 'Mantra -Yoga and Deeksha -meditations', which is beyond ' philosophical discourse and academic cross exchanges'. 



You brought in the explanation of veda mantra from pradeepa commentary : \< Pradipa explains further this: प्रत्यक्षेण शब्दस्वरूपमुपलभमानोऽप्यर्थापरिज्ञानान्न पश्यतीत्यर्थः।> . The term 'artha' is not limited to ' word meaning'. It also communicates the
purpose, the instrument of exploration, the goal, the outcome.



**Now, let us see how this connects to the question asked by Achyut Karve and Misra ji; and what would be the connection of this to the current given sentence debate \< ghatah pashyati> . **



The simulation of primary sentence, anchored to ' ting' for anvaya
from the given vedic text would be \< **एकः पश्यति - एकः शृणोति** \>. The translation i prefer here is \< One sees - One hears>. **The question is what or who is this ' एकः ' and how is this different from ' घटः ' ? Why ?** Is it because the traditional teaching associates the word-meanings different as \< एकः = one ; घटः = pot \> ? Is that all that is involved in this debate? where the activities - capabilities- potencies (= yogyataa saamarthya) of three indriyas are linked : sense of seeing (ChakshuH), sense of hearing (shravana), sense of connecting-processing- bridge to buddhi (manas). Given the position that Patanjali's quote is from Veda ( which excludes the human construction model of interpretation and analysis) and the expression predates Patanjali by few millennia at least, how does grammarians explain the ' pada-artha anvaya' = intention, vision, ishvarecchaa, chodanaa ? One cannot just dismiss this as \< अविद्वांसमाहार्धम्। \> - for the uninitiated, uneducated, half-baked scholar ?? **Why this debate was undertaken more than a millennia before Panini-Patanjali - Yaska and for what benefit ??**



Coming to how ' other Indian teams are working on understanding the 'intention' of this rig-veda reference, I draw your attention to the Virendra Agarwal's donation sponsored initiative of ' Veda-Kosha' ( <http://www.vedakosh.com/rig-veda/mandal-10/sukta-071/mantra-rig-10-071-004>.)
**The stated objective of this initiative is :: \< to make a collection of translation / interpretation of the mantras of the Vedas.** Vedas have 20000+ Mantras. Gradually we will put all the Mantras in a sequential manner in this website. One "Webpage" each for each mantra. **We will also try to put the most popular translations / interpretation of those mantras in Hindi, English and others available**. This will be the "Main Section" of the Mantras. \>





***See the web extracts below***: Ref: <http://www.vedakosh.com/rig-veda/mandal-10/sukta-071/mantra-rig-10-071-004>



Mantra Rig 10.071.004 - उ॒त त्व॒: पश्य॒न्न द॑दर्श॒ वाच॑मु॒त त्व॑: शृ॒ण्वन्न शृ॑णोत्येनाम् । उ॒तो त्व॑स्मै त॒न्वं१॒॑ वि स॑स्रे जा॒येव॒ पत्य॑ उश॒ती सु॒वासा॑: ॥

Mantra 4 of Sukta 71 of Mandal 10 of Rig Veda / Mantra 4 of Varga 23 of Adhyaya 2 of Ashtak 8 of Rig Veda / Mantra 27 of Anuvaak 6 of Mandal 10 of Rig Veda :: ऋषि:- बृहस्पतिः देवता - ज्ञानम् ; छन्द: - पादनिचृत्त्रिष्टुप् ; स्वर: - धैवतः



***The sanskrit explanation is given*** as **(उत त्वः-वाचं पश्यन्-न ददर्श) अपि चैको वाचं लिपिरूपां दृष्ट्या पश्यन् न पश्यति लिपेर्ज्ञानाभावात् **“त्वः-एकः” \[निरु० १।२०\] (उत त्वः-एनां शृण्वन् न शृणोति) अपि चैकः शब्दरूपामेनां वाचं श्रोत्रेण शृण्वन् न शृणोति शब्दानां बोधाभावात् (उतो त्वस्मै तन्वं विसस्रे) अप्येकस्मै स्वात्मानम् “आत्मा वै तनुः” \[श० ६।७।२।६\] विवृणुते-उद्घाटयति ज्ञानकारणात् (पत्ये जाया-इव-उशती सुवासाः) पत्ये या जाया कल्याणवस्त्रा कामयमाना-गार्हस्थ्य-धर्मस्यावसरे स्वशरीरं विवृणुते-उद्घाटयति। तद्वदित्यर्थः ॥४॥



***The Hindi version reads*** : (उत त्वः) **तथा कोई एक (वाचं पश्यन्) लिपिरूप वाणी को आँख से देखता हुआ (न पश्यति) नहीं देखता है लिपि का ज्ञान न होने से (उत त्वः)** तथा कोई एक (एनां शृण्वन्) इस शब्दरूप वाणी को सुनाता हुआ (न शृणोति) नहीं सुनता है, अर्थज्ञान न होने से (उत-उ-त्वस्मै) और किसी एक के लिए (तन्वं विसस्रे) अपने आत्मा को खोल देती है-प्रकट करती है, ज्ञान के कारण से (पत्ये जाया-इव) पति के लिये पत्नी जैसे (उशती सुवासाः) अच्छे वस्त्र धारण किये हुए गृहस्थ धर्म की कामना करती हुई अपने शरीर को खोल देती है, प्रकट करती है ॥४॥



**The above explanation of Rigveda mantra is presented below, adds newer complications !** The ' scripting' issue of Samskrutham ! and its ancientness going to whatever time Vedas are posited to be !! And interpreting the visual orthographic form of spoken word as the ' intention- contention- communication' from the veda mantra.

There are total deviations and discrepancies in such translations from the classical position, textual teaching and practice -guidance given from Vedanga- Vyakarana tradition, Yajna-Karma Upaasanaa traditional practices and Darshana Shaastra sampradayas holds to be the meaning - intention- contention -communication - purpose ( Totally VINIYOGA in one word from Shaunaka, as Dr. Yadu keeps pointing).



Shaunaka is closer to Panini Samspradaya from any one of us, in a historical sense and is focused on explaining why so many factors need to be considered in explaining the utility of Veda-mantra.



The individual who fails to see this comprehensive guidance is
\<अविद्वांस \> for whom the meaning of the \< veda-sukta> does not get revealed \< प्रत्यक्षेण शब्दस्वरूपमुपलभमानोऽप्यर्थापरिज्ञानान्न पश्यतीत्यर्थः \> This is Pradeepa observation in the commentary; and substantiated in Bhartruhari's famous ' anaadi nidhanam brahma, SphoTa, prasuptaa vak' and many other expressions . The expression ' pashyati' ends in ' Knowledge- Comprehension' beyond visual seeing.





So, I feel that the onus of explaining the ' TRUE PURPOSE of TEXT' through explorations by asking ( right/ probing) questions from our time and position, to get relevant answers, rests on the Home Team.



Playing to gallery using the appealing concept of 'pleasing the donor and desiring their tribe to increase the support for Veda-Vit ( daataaro no abhivardhataam' ) is NOT the path to be tread by responsible persons , if they heed to the warning message in vedic quotes from
Yaska : 'adheetya vedaan , na vijaanati yortham, ....., vidyaa ha vai brahmanam aajagaama.....'. **The dangers of distorted and diluted interpretative translations of Veda invokes dangerous consequences.**



So let us leave the 'Vedas to safe realm' and be happy to provide a safe-passage, till some one finds real competence to deal with it.
