Indian science proceeded by questioning what the universe is.

It became natural science (philosophy).  

Socrates and Plato had that view. Aristotle differed, he went to engineering.

Lately we have object-based physical science.  

Arabs appreciated Indian science, but the British tried to roll it over.

The undoing had its effects.  

  

Something appears as repetitive because we do not know. Asking "what is water" is science, to use water is engineering.

The fundamental questions will continue to remain unanswered for the future scholars who can see the universe as a whole (without boundaries).

So we may revert back to the golden age of Indian science in another few hundred years.
