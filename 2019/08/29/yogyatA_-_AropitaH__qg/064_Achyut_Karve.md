Dear Vidwans,

  

In general what is the difference in the Indian and Western approach to the reality around?

  

The starting point of the Indian way of looking at reality is the universal or the general to arrive at the particular. In contrast the starting point of the Western way of looking at reality is the particular from which they intend to rise towards the universal.

  

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
