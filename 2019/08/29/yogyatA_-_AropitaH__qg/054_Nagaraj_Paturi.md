No, you are not correct. Because, a person with if at all used them, uses them to see.

  

In the statement quoted by you, if it was said that some people with eyes can not hear and some people with ears can not see, that statement would have proved that eyes can be described to have yogyataa with hearing and ears can be described to have yogyataa with sight.

By sayingthat some people with eyes can not see and some people with ears can not hear, the quoted statement reaffirmed yogyataa of eyes with sight and of ears with hearing.
