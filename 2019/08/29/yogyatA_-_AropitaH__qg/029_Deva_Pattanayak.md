"visibility of objects and the sense of vision are made or born or exist for each other"

  

Dear Nagaraj_ji  

Visibility of objects imply light reflected or coming from an object. The light is the source. The sense of vision is feelings or excitations the light

causes in the eye. The eye is the sink. There exists an inherent relationship between the source and the sink in this case the visibility of objects and the sense of vision as you stated above.  

One of the famous quote in Physics is some thing like

" A light million light years ago a star would not have emitted a photon if million light years later there would not be an observer to see it."

The deeper philosophical implication is: to born is to die, creation anticipates destruction, preservation is transitory.

  

With best regards

Deva
