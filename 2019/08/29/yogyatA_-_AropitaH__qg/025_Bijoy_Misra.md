Bhatji,

It is not the object of seeing, but the mechanics of seeing.

योग्यता अनादिः is one thing, संबन्ध अनादिः is another.  

They are similar as per the statement.

It is the enunciation of former that I am looking.

I realize that I have to work on these than throwing questions!

Best regards,  

BM
