Strictly all the .विषयs can be grasped by the related Indriya only and that is called अनादिः संबन्ध. Just like sound can be heard through ears only and that relation is fixed. In this way all the विषयs शब्द, रस, रूप, गन्ध, स्पर्श related indriya-s only and eternally. And never can be changed. One cannot see things through ears or hear sound through eyes. One may be unable to see things if his eyes are defective and blind. That does not mean the relationship is not eternal.
