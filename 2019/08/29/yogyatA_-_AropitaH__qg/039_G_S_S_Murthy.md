As a layman I am trying to follow this thread. Will I be right in saying that yogyataa ensures that the meaning is not absurd and that presence or absence of "yogyataa" can only be determined at the semantic level? That is, "yogyataa" is not there if the meaning is absurd. Is this correct?

Thanks and regards,

Murthy
