"In the same manner, as the sense-faculties have a beginningless  
suitability/fitness (yogyatā) with regard to their objects, the  
relation of words with their objects/meanings is a beginningless  
suitability/fitness (yogyatā)."

  

Dear Roland,  

  

In Physics there always exists an inherent relationship(connection, Jogyata) between sources and sinks. One can not exit without the other. The sabda is emanated (by the Indriyas, mouth,lungs, mind brain ,body etc)(source)and is received (understood)by the ear, brain, mind, body etc(sinks). Clearly there exists a relationship/connection between the sabda and its meaning/object.

I am not sure if Yogyata means suitability/fitness, it may simply mean inherent relationship or connection( the manifestation of

Yoga between two things, sabda and object above, which is anadi(intrinsic) ) .

Best wishes

Deva
