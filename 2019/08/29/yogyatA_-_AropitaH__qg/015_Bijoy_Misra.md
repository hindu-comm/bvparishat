Nagarajji,

You did it.

  

Now we go a step further.

  

यथा इन्द्रियाणां स्वविषयेषु योग्यता अनादिः (अस्ति /भवति ) implies that

there exist objects whose स्वविषयेषु योग्यता is not अनादिः  

  

I wanted to check if there is an analysis of this concept. I guessed साङ्ख्य.

Some साङ्ख्य or other दर्शन scholar may have the information.

  

Best regards,

BM
