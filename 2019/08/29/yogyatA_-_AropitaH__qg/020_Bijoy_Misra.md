Thank you, Bhatji.

I have to think more on the equivalence of  

इन्द्रियाणां विषयेषु योग्यता = विषयाणामिन्द्रियैः ग्रहणे योग्यता,  

  

The equivalence is strictly not true from the phenomenological view point.

  

I had some Gita discussion that started this thread. It is to do with distinguishing the field versus shapes in the field.

Shapes/objects ( विषय) are आरोपितः

  

So has been my understanding from cosmology and metaphysics.

  

May be we have analyzed enough on this thread. I have to do some work myself.
