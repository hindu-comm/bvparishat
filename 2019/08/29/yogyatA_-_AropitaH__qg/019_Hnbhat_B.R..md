But you have taken the wrong sense contrary to the verse. Please see Prof.Korada's explanations of 'yogyata' or the translation of of the verse by Prof.Aklujkar provided by Roladnd in his post. Both have studied VP of Bhartrhari than anyone.

  

इन्द्रियाणां विषयेषु योग्यता = विषयाणामिन्द्रियैः ग्रहणे योग्यता, तथा

शब्दानां अर्थैः योग्यता शब्दैः ग्रहणे योग्यता, अनादिर्भवति इत्यन्वयः। I take both are अनादि and need not be translated as not अनादि in one case without any particular reason.  

  

"सिद्धे शब्दार्थसंबन्धे" वार्तिक in the Mahabhashya also confirms relation between word and meaning is अनादि and the same is interpreted as योग्यता = संबन्धः by Prof. Nagaraja Paturi.
