Dear Vidwans,

  

True the relationship of word and its meaning is without a beginning but at what level? 1) Only for साधू शब्द and not for अपशब्द. 2) At the general level or as a universality. That is when we grant that words exist outside us. However these words (without a beginning) live or get permanence through the the medium of an individual which is their particularity. That the permanence of such beginningless words is guaranteed one has to take effort to imbibe them in oneself.

  

Just making effort is not enough. Here comes the word योग्यता.

  

If we ask the question why should we make an effort? The answer is in order to secure the necessary prerequisites which would enable us to establish in ourselves that permanent relationship between word and meaning. In short to create fitness in ourselves to appreciate and realize word and its oneness with its meaning. And this is all that grammar is about.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
