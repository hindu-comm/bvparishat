Dear Vidwans,

  

In general what is the difference in the Indian and Western approach to the reality around?

  

The starting point of the Indian way of looking at reality is the universal or the general to arrive at the particular. In contrast the starting point of the Western way of looking at reality is the particular from which they intend to rise towards the universal.

  

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.

  

Dear Karve_ji

  

Without quoting others, in my opinion there is no difference between them. Both are based on "general" principles believed to be true at certain point of time. A principle that is universally true is also true in a particular case.

  

A good read is the book on "An introduction to the Vedas", by Maharshi Dayanand Saraswati.

  

It is written there that advances in Vedic knowledge stopped after Nirukta. Since then the emphasis was to preserve Vedas through recitation during religious functions by the priests to whom credit goes for the preservation of the then Vedic knowledge. Many old texts are not accessible today or are unread. Important to underscore Vedic. Since then Knowledge continued by the Buddhists, Jains and in the western world.

  

Western science and engineering made fundamental discoveries in answering particular phenomena such as gravity that holds all of us to the earth and revolves the earth and the planets around the Sun.

More recent particular advance is in the computer technology following
basic advances in our understanding of the dynamics of real and virtual particles, electrons and holes in semiconductor materials. While working as an engineer I felt the importance of basic general Physics knowledge and the challenges encountered in particular to design and fabricate
very small and high performance electronic components,integrated circuits and systems. The knowledge at the particular level is as difficult and useful as at a general level. So both particular and general aspects are important.



In a recent inaugural address Nagraj_ji invited the Shastra Acharyas to take charge and do not consider themselves to be inferior in any way to the Professors in reputable universities engaged in non-productive research.

  

The emphasis alone on historicity and repetitivity keeps one in the groove of the past. What is needed is to advance philosophy, science and technology with an objective to make living better materially and spiritually in particular ( Ghatah Pasyati) and in general ( Tat Tuam Asi).

  

This is not going to be easy. It is a mighty("Brahma") task. However, the outcome of this effort will be beneficial to humanity at large living in the east,west, north ,south , north east, south east,north west, south west, up and down ( the ten directions).

  

Best wishes

Deva
