See the "Brief Analysis" (p. 122) by Prof. Aklujkar:  
  
"The meaning relation is just the beginningless fitness (yogyatƒÅ)  
between linguistic forms and their meanings, analogous to the fitness  
sense organs possess for their contents." (Ashok Aklujkar, in: Karl  
Potter \[General Editor\]. Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies. The  
Philosophy of the Grammarians. Howard G. Coward and K. Kunjunni Raja.  
Delhi etc: Motilal Banarsidass 1990, p. 158).
