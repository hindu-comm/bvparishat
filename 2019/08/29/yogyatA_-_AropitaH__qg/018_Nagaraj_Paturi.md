Bijoy-ji,

  

Analogies are not read that way.

  

Here,

  

विवक्षा is in " शब्दानां अर्थैः योग्यता सम्बंधः अनादिः (अस्ति) । " only.

  

इन्द्रियाणां स्वविषयेषु योग्यता अनादिः (अस्ति /भवति )

  

is just an analogy.  

  

No new point is being made there.

  

When an author brings any point as an analogy, he considers that his audience take that point for granted.

  

When did the mutuality between visible objects and eye / sense of vision (the principle that only visible objects are related to eye and eye is related only to the visible objects) begin ? visibility of objects and the sense of vision are made or born or exist for each other. There is no point in time when such a made or born or exist for each other began. People take this point for granted. That is why it can be brought as an analogy.
