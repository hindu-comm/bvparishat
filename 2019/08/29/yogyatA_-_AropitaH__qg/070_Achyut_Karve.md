Dear Vidwans,

  

How is Yogyata different for Indian thought as compared to that of the West.

  

Take the example of the eye. When the West realised that the natural ability (yogyata) of the eye was limited they attempted to improve it.
This they achieved by means of the microscope an instrument external to us.

  

  

But how did the Indians see the Universal? Take the two words Brahman and Pranav (shabda tatva). In the very first Sloka of the Vakpadiyam Bhrtruhari combines the two by placing them sideby side. The ladder to the revelation of the Universal is itself the instrument through which it is revealed. Thus the that and this. Pranav is the universal in the particular.

  

Now therefore what is Yogyata from the Indian pointof view? An understanding of the nature of language. Therefore grammar becomes the basis for Yogyata. Grammar as an instrument internal to us.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
