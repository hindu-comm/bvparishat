But Prof. Misra,

  

Did you notice that योग्यता is a kind of relation between entities and not a feature of an object ? (You stated , "Every object has a योग्यता.")

  

Bhartrihari borrows a huge amount of technical terms from मीमांसा । Of course , he uses them in a distinct वैयाकरण sense. भावना, इतिकर्तव्यता etc. are all from मीमांसा only. But the sense in which Bhartrihari uses them is distinctly different and Paninian.

  

योग्यता आकांक्षा, आसत्ति , तात्पर्य are among such.

  

Ideas in

  

योग्यताकांक्षासत्तिसहितपदसमुदायम् वाक्ययम् ।

  

योग्यता पदार्थानां परस्परसम्बन्धे बाधाभावः।  

  

etc. are

  

older than the use of the words योग्यता आकांक्षा, आसत्ति , तात्पर्य etc. by Bhartrihari.

  

Close English equivalent of योग्यता is compatibility, here syntactic compatibility.
