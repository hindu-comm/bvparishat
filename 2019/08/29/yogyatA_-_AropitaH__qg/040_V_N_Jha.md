Yes, Murthyji, you are right when yogyataa is defined as ‘artha-abaadhah’ in Navya Nyaya. Here it stands for ‘compatibility’. But in the verse under discussion it stands for ‘the natural (svaabhaavika) capacity(vaacakatva-shakti) to express meaning’ comparable to ‘the inherent capacity of the sense-organs to generate cognition’ as has been pointed out by Prof. Kodad Subrahmanyam by quoting the commentary of Helaaraaja.



Best wishes,
