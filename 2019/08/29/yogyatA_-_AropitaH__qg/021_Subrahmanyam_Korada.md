नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

I thought I have explained the verse well -- but ....

  

The example from ज्योतिषम् is to clarify that the योग्यता elsewhere is different from what we are discussing -- even

the योग्यता ( a prerequisite of a sentence) -- चैत्रः अग्निना सिञ्चति -- is quite different .

  

The योग्यता , under discussion , is highly technical and used only in पाणिनिदर्शनम् , at top level ( pl note वाक्यपदीयम्

is a commentary on महाभाष्यम् - so it is not easy to understand the former without deep understanding of the latter-- I

am not quoting the relevant lines from the latter ) --- it is slightly difficult to understand --

  

Helaraja explains --

  

समवायादिनिमित्तानपेक्षयैव उच्चरिमात्रात् शब्दात् अर्थप्रत्ययोत्पतेः अकृत्रिमा शक्तिरवसीयते । अर्थमात्रेण हि शब्दमात्रस्य अवियोगम्

अप्रवृत्तसङ्केता अपि प्रतिपद्यन्ते । तथा च योग्यता स्वाभाविकी सिद्धा , सङ्केतस्तु तामेव द्योतयति । तद्यथा चक्षुरादीनां रूपादिविषये पुरुषप्रयत्नानपेक्षा ग्राहकता ।

  

There are two things --

  

शब्द denotes अर्थ through a natural capacity called योग्यता and this is akin to the natural capacity of sense organs which

grasp the things / objects concerned .

**Both , शब्द and इन्द्रिय , have this capacity since time immemorial -- अनादि ।**

  

The योग्यता is not आरोपित (superimposed) by anyone .

  

Now come to the second stage --

  

there is one thing called सङ्केत / समय ---

  

the word घटः denotes the meaning घट due to योग्यता -- when a boy is named घट (this is from अम्बाकर्त्री , a commentary

by Vid रघुनाथशर्मा - so you can have घटः पश्यति - here only) --

the father means - ’ here after my son should be known by the name घट ’-- this is called स‘ङ्केत / समय ।

This सङ्केत / समय is द्योतक -- it is so called because the घटशब्द here is not denoting the original meaning but

a different meaning (पुत्रः) due to आरोप ।

  

So योग्यता is the base of other artificial संबन्ध-s such as समय - सङ्केत - समवाय etc.

  

धन्यो’स्मि
