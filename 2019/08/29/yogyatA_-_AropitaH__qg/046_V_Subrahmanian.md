Paturi ji,

  

The shaastra position is: all indriyas are present, as a part of a jiva's sukshma sharira. Indriyas are anaadi and the jiva has these without exception in all his janmas. Only that due to his karma certain indriya/s do not function or function below par. In certain janma-s there may not be need for a certain indriyas. But the default position is: all jivas have all indiryas as part of their sukshma sharira till moksha. I am producing the relevant verse of the Vivekachudamani with the commentary of HH Sri Chandrashekhara Bharati Swamiji where these aspects are mentioned:

In these matters there agreement across all schools of Vedanta. That the sukshma sharira along with its components is anadi and does not get destroyed at each janma is certain, as it is based on the Upanishads. While the gross body alone is got anew and perishes at each janma, the subtle body is not so; it is the same across all janmas till mukti.

  

warm regards
