A sensor (sensing instrument) is different than a sense organ.

I tend to think that the साङ्ख्य sensor इन्द्रिय would be a sensor.

A sensor captures information and does not interpret. it is a channel, not a processor. It has no memory.  

So an इन्द्रिय has स्वविषयेषु योग्यता, in order to detect and receive information.

The दर्शनेन्द्रिय does not "see" the universe, just receives light from the universe.

  

When the दर्शनेन्द्रिय is connected to a body, it becomes चक्षु , a ज्ञानेन्द्रिय to perceive shapes - रूप

  

While the चक्षु is transient, the इन्द्रिय is अनादि, so is its स्वविषयेषु योग्यता

  

इन्द्रिय in this logic is a concept, not an object. चक्षु is an object.

  

This topic has more nuance than the above simplistic statements.
