\> Visibility of objects imply light reflected or coming from an object. The light is the source. The sense of vision is feelings or excitations the light

causes in the eye. The eye is the sink.

  

The s'aastras have a different way of looking at it.

  

indriya is not a passive receiver, an active detector.

  

senses of vision, audition, smell, taste, touch etc. are called sūkṣmēndriyas. eye, ear, nose, tongue and skin are called sthūlēndriyas . sūkṣmēndriyas work through sthūlēndriyas .

  

sūkṣmēndriyas detect the visible objects through their quality called visibility, audible objects through their quality called audibility etc.  

  

Sri Chittaranjan Naik-ji is coming up with a whole book on this called , "Natural Realism and Contact Theory of Perception " . Indic Academy is publishing the book. Very soon , it is going to be in stands.
