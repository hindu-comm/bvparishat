Dear Sri Karve,

  

They are two different approaches.

The scientific approach would say that the whole is unknown. We assume it exists because we are in it. Mathematically it is beyond our comprehension.

We are going through the Jaina auspicious time now. Jaina Mathematicians did distinguish between असङ्खेय and अनन्त.

The engineering approach would be to assume that असङ्खेय is अनन्त.

  

When units add they can become large असङ्खेय , but अनन्त is a concept, it has no representation.  

When we write thoughts we become engineers, when we understand we are scientists.

  

The old Indians tried hard not to inscribe, but to understand.
Understanding is a multi-function modality.

It is active immersion with the object (including oneself), not by observing or hearing.

  

It can be simulated in children at very young age before we tell them that they have names etc.

Understanding is pure science. We try to influence the children with our understanding आरोपित.

India discovered the freedom of human thinking and we have to gain it back (though it is hard in the current time!)

  

I have loved this discussion.
