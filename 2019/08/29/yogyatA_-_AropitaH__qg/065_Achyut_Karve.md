Dear Vidwans,

  

The difference in approach leads to contrasting observations.

  

Whereas an Indian will look at the particularity as the embodiment of the universal the Westerner will look at the universality just as the sum total of the particulars.

  

The question is how do we reconcile these opposing thought processes.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
