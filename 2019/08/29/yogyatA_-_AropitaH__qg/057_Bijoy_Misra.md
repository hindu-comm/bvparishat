There is also brilliant science hidden in the stanza that Prof Korada had brought out.

शब्दः कारणमर्थस्य स हि तेनोपजन्यते ।

तथा च बुद्धिविषयात् अर्थात् शब्दः प्रतीयते ॥ **वा प . पदकाण्डः , सम्बन्धसमुद्देशः - 32**

**  
**

शब्दः प्रतीयते**** is the key clause.**  
**

The शब्दः is perceived after the sound is processed through बुद्धिविषयात् अर्थात्  

  

So different people will perceive different शब्दः since बुद्धिविषय is local and is memory driven, बुद्धि is a qualifier.  

  

At the same time, the सम्बन्ध between शब्द and अर्थ is eternal in the sense that सम्बन्ध is between इन्द्रिय and स्वविषयेषु योग्यता  

  

Bhatrhari's science has to be brought out and celebrated. It is a "must read" for all researchers both in science and humanities.

For science, we see analytic thoughts. For humanities we see precision of analytic expression without symbols.
