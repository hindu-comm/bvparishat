Dear Vidwans,

  

Here is another example.

  

Western philosophers late into 19th century would ask what a chair was.
Or what was the nature of the word 'chair'. They could not figure out the nature of a word.

  

Marx retorted this by saying sit on it to find out whether the word chair is realor not.

  

Against this Indians knew what a word was centuries ago. Look at the definition of a word at the beginning of the Pashpanhik of the Mahabhashya. Indians knew that a word was not the thing but the representation of the impression of the thing on the mind screen.

  

It is for this reason that Yogyata was a prerequisite for pursuing studies.

  

What if Indian scriptural literature is looked at from the lens of Western Methodology which today is material? This type of viewing Indian Scriptures is what can be called 'आरोपितः'.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
