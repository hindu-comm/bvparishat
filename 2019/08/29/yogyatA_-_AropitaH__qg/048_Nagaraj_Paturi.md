this is not in response to Sri V Subrahmanian-ji:

  

Yogyataa is a kind of relationship between two entities.

  

It requires two entities.

  

Kinship is a kind of a relationship between two persons.

  

Brother - in - law is a kinship term.

  

We can not make a statement ' He is a brother - in -law' '

  

We can only say ' He is the brother - in -law of ...........'

  

Similarly we can not say, "This entity has Yogyataa "

  

We can only say " This entity has Yogyataa with ................. (entity) "

  

'Wife', 'Husband' etc. are also kinship terms.

  

They are always used as " Wife of ........ " , " Husband of ......... "

  

There can be woman. If she is not married, her compatibility with her husband is a non-issue.

  

'Wife' always has Yogyataa with 'husband'. 'Woman' need not have yogyataa with 'man'. 'Woman' is not a relationship describing term. 'Wife' is a relationship describing term. That 'wife' is related to 'husband' s axiomatic.

  

Indriya is such a relationship describing term. The relationship here is the function of detection. Vishaya of Indriya is also a relationship describing term. Detector-detected is the relationship between indriya and indriyavishaya.

  

S'abda is also such a term All sounds are not words. Once a sound is a word, its defining feature is that it denotes/signifies a meaning. S'abda's artha is called so only because it is being signified by the s'abda. Intrinsic Yogyataa is between a s'abda and its artha only not between any s'abda and any artha.
