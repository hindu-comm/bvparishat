One last thing.

  

The question can be if the field (analog) contains life, but then it can't be field any more (in mathematical sense)

Life as we understand needs be contained in local units.

Through इन्द्रिय the object will sense, but it would form object by processing the senses (as you call active).

As life perishes, the इन्द्रिय does not perish. So is the intent here as I see. This makes it interesting.

  

I will have more to say from neurology and cosmology later.

  

Best regards,
