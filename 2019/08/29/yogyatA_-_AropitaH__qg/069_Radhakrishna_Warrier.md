Interesting. This could be a typical piece of conversation in Malayalam:

  

Avanu ee joli cheyyaan yogyata illa, kaaranam avanu samskritam ariyilla.

  

("avanu" = for him; "ee" = this; "joli" = job; "cheyyaan" = to do; "yogyata" = qualifications; "illa" = there isn't, lacking, etc,; "kaaranam" = reason, because; "ariyilla" = doesn't know. 

  

He doesn't have the qualifications to do this job because he doesn't know Sanskrit.)

  

Here, yogyata is used in the sense of qualifications. But couldn't it also be explained in the sense of joining the person with the job? The person and the job could not be joined together (united, yoked together) because the person is lacking the perquisites for performing the job.

  

Regards,

Radhakrishna Warrier
