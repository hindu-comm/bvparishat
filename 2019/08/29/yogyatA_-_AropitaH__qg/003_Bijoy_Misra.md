Prof Paturi,

The definition of योग्यताis in the first line below (in my opinion).  

  

इन्द्रियाणां स्वविषयेष्वनादिर्योग्यता यथा ।

अनादिरर्थैः शब्दानां सम्बन्धो योग्यता तथा ॥ **वा प , प कां , 29**

**  
**

It fits in with the independence of "sensing" as we understand lately.  

Then he carries it to the use in speech. "speech" itself has no योग्यता in the spirit of the first line.  

In speech the use in his definition is शब्दानां सम्बन्धोi stated n the second line.  

But I have not studied other literature to check where योग्यता as a cosmological attribute might have been introduced,  

It appears as a साङ्ख्य term to me, but I don't recall seeing it in the text we use.  

So i asked.  

  

Best regards,

BM
