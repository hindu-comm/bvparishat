\> The definition of योग्यताis in the first line below (in my opinion).  
\>  
\> इन्द्रियाणां स्वविषयेष्वनादिर्योग्यता यथा ।  

\> अनादिरर्थैः शब्दानां सम्बन्धो योग्यता तथा ॥ \*वा प , प कां , 29\*  
  
It is definitely not a "definition of योग्यता". In fact, Bhartṛhari  
compares the relation between words and their meanings with the  
relation between sense-faculties and their objects. anādir yogyatā is  
the quality which both relations have in common:  
  
"In the same manner, as the sense-faculties have a beginningless  
suitability/fitness (yogyatā) with regard to their objects, the  
relation of words with their objects/meanings is a beginningless  
suitability/fitness (yogyatā)."  
  
It goes without saying that no translation can replace the discussion  
of the various possibilities of understanding the notion of yogyatā or  
anādi or anādir yogyatā (as a whole).
