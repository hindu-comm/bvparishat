Dear Vidwans,

  

The question of योग्यता comes into being because of a four way mediation between the word and what it standsfor.

  

Word - impression of it on the mind screen as sound - impression of what it stands for on the mind screen - the thing proper that it stands for.
Each one of the above have their own unique characteristics and each can be dealt with separately.

  

In the case of सिद्धे शब्दार्थ संबंधे there needs to be coordination between all the above four aspects of speech on the go.

  

It is this expectation of coordination which necessitates the use of the word योग्यता or fitness with respect to the use of words.

  

It is also because of the possibility of this lack of coordination between the above four aspects that Patanjali has included विपर्यय and विकल्प as being क्लिष्ट अक्लिष्ट vruttis of the chitta.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
