Part of the problem in understanding yogyataa seems to be stemming from conflating the present day daily use word yogyataa in most Indian languages and the the technical term yogyataa as used in S'aastras like VyakaraNa.

  

In the present day daily use, word yogyataa in most Indian languages is used in the sense of quality of a single entity, particularly of a human being, not necessary in relation to another entity.

  

Yah ek yogy manushy hai.

  

Ivanu yogya manushya.

  

Itanu yogyaDu.

  

are valid sentences.

  

Yah khane yogy vastu hai.

  

Ivanu maduvege yogya huDuga.

  

Itanu pELliki yogyuDu.

  

are also valid.

  

But the second set is already bringing a second entity/aspect.

  

As a technical term, yogyataa is close to it's root yuj =join, put together, unify.

Yogya = joinable, fit to be put together, unify able

Yogyataa = joinability, fitness to be put together, unifiability.

  

We can not say this object/person is joinable.

  

We can say entity A and entity B are joinable (with each other) / fit to be put together/unifiable.

  

Thus we can sayentity A and entity B have yogyataa =joinability/fitness to be put together/unifiability (with each other).
