Dr BVK,

I admire your insistence on the basic interpretation of the Vedas. It does indeed take the human civilization back

many thousands years since each statement must have to be empirically established. I have been of the opinion

that the Vedas are a compilation of human observations at a certain point in time. Each line of statement may

have its own history.

  

We have two threads in parallel. घटः पश्यति is a grammar thread where sentence construction is being analyzed.

This thread started with the word योग्यता that I encountered in VP of Bhatrhari and later I heard the word आरोपित

in the young scholar's video in Kashi Assembly.

  

The point I wish to add is that we have to distinguish between the "detection" of sound against "hearing" a sound.

To have the योग्यता of detection of sound, we need an acoustic sensor.
A sensor detects, does not measure or recognize.

In order to "hear" the sound we need the योग्यता of mapping and recognition. Here the mind and brain have to be involved.

At times, we can map but can't recognize leading to the statement made in the quotes from Patanjali and Pradipa.

Here we come to a different योग्यता which is analyzed in बृहदारण्यक उपनिषद् .

  

The question is if we can try to put a time line to the two concepts.
Srmadbhagavatam gives a good statement on

the detection in order to introduce space आकाश. Interestingly आकाश as a primordial element was not included in

Greek cosmology. The theory and analysis of sound is peculiarly of Indian origin.

  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
