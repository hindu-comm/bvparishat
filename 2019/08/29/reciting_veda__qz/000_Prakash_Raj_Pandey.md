Pranaam to all scholars,

  

The conventions we follow when reciting veda is explained by this text as I have referred to in an earlier post; but this text does not deal with hand gestures.  
  
The vaidik scholars following other traditions can compare this with their traditions for a better understanding of the overall vaidik practices.
