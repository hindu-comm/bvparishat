Thank you so much for this book Guruji \_/\\\_

But, when I heard some of the Leftist arguments on twitter, one of them was close to Nimittapaya Nyaya. Or Sannipat Paribhasha. Which grabbed my interest.

Like, they're saying IOA was signed by Hari Singh because of condition, to apply 370. Now when 370 is scrapped, the IOA automatically becomes void.

Like, Nimitta for IOA - 370.  
Naimittika - IOA.  
Nimittapaye - on removing 370,  
Naimittikasyapyapayah - IOA will automatically become invalid. Or go away.

I'm finding a counter to it, do you have any to prove this Nyaya Anitya over here?
