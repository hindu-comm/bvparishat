I have thought of countering it in a way how Panini does it, by hinting proofs that it's not applicable in that part.  
  
Like, in छ्वोः शूड् Sootra, he tells that for 'च्छ' this सतुक् part, we will replace it with श्. Now  
छे च tells त् will come by making छ as a Nimitta, but when छ getting replaced by श्, the त् (Naimittika) should automatically go away no?  
But Panini doesn't want it like that, so he adds a सतुक् ग्रहण of छ् and wants श् to replace entire च्छ and not only छ्.  
  
Similarly, the method of scraping 370 is mentioned in 370, that means Nimitta-Paribhasha is not intended over here. If it was intended, why would they mention the scrapping method?
