Dear Vidwans,

  

Why dissolving the state was important? The reason was to take away the responsibility of internal security of J&K from the hands of the State Govt. The dissolution of the State Govt. and the formation of a UT has given the Union Govt. free hand to maintain internal security of the region.

  

Why this step?

  

In the past we have heard that in some districts of J&K there is a growing presence of ISIS. If this threat has to be tackled effectively there is no other way but take law and order which is a state subject into the hands of the Union.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
