Thanks for this upload. Some interesting information about the author, the book, etc. are found in this edition:

  

<https://www.exoticindiaart.com/book/details/nanartha-ratnamala-of-irugapa-dandadhinatha-old-and-rare-book-NZJ463/>

  

In the sample pages given, we see that this kosha contains words that are spelled very similar to words in Kannada, Malayalam, etc. The author is of the 14 - 15th Century CE, from the court of Vijayanagar. The page is attached.

  

warm regards
