Dear friends,

Our poets group here, the South Asian Poets of New England, has been hosting a

Folk Literature meet for the last two years and this is our third year.
In this connection,

I wish to seek your help in locating and compiling the renderings in different languages.

My personal technical interest is in the information content of vowels in language rendering

and I will write more later.  

I would appreciate receiving pointers to any field or studio recording of folk literature

in different languages of India and of the neighboring countries. Feel free to join in

the picnic on next Sunday, Aug 11.

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
