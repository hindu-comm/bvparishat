They are using सर्वकारः from सरकार in Sanskrit News Bulletins. Taking a cue from this, I hope in these new Sanskrit plays, they dont address superior persons as, "सर्वकार !" . You may recall in Khushwant Singh's novel, 'A Train to Pakistan', the koThewali and her protégé address the city magistrate, Hukam Chand, as 'Government!' The novel is entirely in English. All the endearments in Punjabi are also rendered into English.
