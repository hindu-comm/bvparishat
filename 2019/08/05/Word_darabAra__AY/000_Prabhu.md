In the following web document:  
<https://sanskritdocuments.org/doc_z_misc_major_works/kalidas.html?lang=sa>  
  
  
word दरबार is used as if its a saMskR^ita word:  
“सर्वे जानन्ति यत् भोजराज्ञः दरबारे अविद्यत कविः कालीदासः...”  
  
My understanding is “durbar@ is from Persian: ‫دربار‬‎ - darbār. (From Wikipedia)  
  
Is there दरबार in saMskR^ita too?

prabhu
