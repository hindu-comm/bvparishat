I am in agreement with your point "In sum,yes, "The Economic Sutra" is an attempt in the right direction...", Dr. Nori.

  

Each person might, justifiably so, have a different appetite for what is being offered by Dr. Sihag and Dr. Deodhar's books. I was happy to learn whatever they had to offer and I might be happier to be pointed to books that are better than these, if they exist, in specifically what they have set out to do.

  

Sincerely,

Megh
