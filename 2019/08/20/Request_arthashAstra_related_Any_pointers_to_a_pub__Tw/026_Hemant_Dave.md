Dear Megh,

  

This could be for the simple reason that there is no cogent refutation of the arguments put forward by Mittal. While I have read Trautmann's, I have not studied Mittal's, so I cannot comment. But yes, when a work is not quoted, debated, or referred to, it automatically goes out of academic discussion, and becomes oblivious. So not quoting a useful, engaging, thought-provokingwork is part of the politics of scholarship.

  

I have observed, but I could be wrong, Indian scholars are not fond of quoting Indian savants, they prefer western writers instead. To give one instance. D. D. Kosambi in his article on the Beginning of the Iron Age in India refutes an interpretation suggested by Wilhelm Rau.The Vedic and later Vedic texts give descriptions of ploughing with ‘six, eight, twelve or even twenty-four oxen’. In Rau's opinion, we learn from Kosambi, this team was 'ceremonial' and not actual. Kosambipoints out that ‘There is no doubt of twelve-ox teams being used, as they still are, for ploughing heavy soils with **the heavy plough** \[…\]. So Rau’s doubts stem from ignorance of Indian farming technique’ (1963: 315 and note 2; my emphasis). So far so good. What Kosambi does not tell us is revealing. In the*History and Culture of Indian People*, quoting which is a cardinal sin in dominant Indian historiography, V. M. Apte writes after referring to the team of oxen mentioned in the Vedic texts that '**the plough must have been large and heavy**’(Apte 1951: 464; my emphasis)(obviously to till hard soil like the black cotton soil).Kosambi chooses not to mention Apte and thus puts him into oblivion. Since dominant Indian historiography apes if incapably Kosambi's excellent methods, the subsequent writings will automaticallynotmention V. M. Apte. Given the linguistic inability, a(n overwhelming) majority of Indianscholars will go to Rau's work. If they do, they will read Apte's name there thus:‘V. M. Apte möchte aus diesen Angaben auf die Schwere der Pflüge, ich dagegen lieber auf die Habgier der Priester schließen. Die genannten Tiere sollen nach ŚB \[Śatapatha Brāmhaṇa\] 7, 2, 2, 21 nämlich dem *adhvaryu* geschenkt werden: also je mehr desto besser!’ (Rau 1957: § 18, p. 25) Rau thus thinks that since the animals were to be gifted to the adhvaryu later, the greedy priest insisted on more animals: the more the better.

  

It was fromRau that I knew that such wasthe original interpretation of Apte and that it was picked up, without acknowledgement, by Kosambi!

  

To sum up: Indian historians will not refer to Mittal's work and soon it will be forgotten; Trautmann's work will be constantly referred to and his (dubious) conclusion will come to be accepted as final.

  

Attached are two writings which you may find useful. Steiner's first two pages refers to such politics (he does not call it politics though). The other is a review by Jamison of the viability of statistics in dating Sanskrit texts.

  

Best wishes,

Hemant
