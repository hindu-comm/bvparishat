In Richard Stoneman's 2021 book[Megasthenes' Indica: A New Translation of the Fragments with Commentary](https://www.routledge.com/Megasthenes-Indica-A-New-Translation-of-the-Fragments-with-Commentary/Stoneman/p/book/9780367472948), while Dr. Trautmann's work vis-a-vis the chronological epoch of the*Arthaśāstra* is alluded to (some relevant excerpts below), unsurprisingly (for me at least), Dr. Mital's critique of Dr. Trautmann's work (ref: <https://groups.google.com/g/bvparishat/c/TwawZSd6fpI/m/10tXr0zgBQAJ>) is wholly missing.

Best,
