I am not sure if I am the only one whois mildly piqued (I don't think that might be the case but I certainly hope that is not the case) by the fact that in the Kindle edition of Dr Patick Ollivelle's student Dr Mark McClish's Cambridge University Press published book *T**he History of the****Arthaśāstra***(2019), one finds Dr Trautmann referred to several times in the book but Mital-ji's work wholly absent.

  

From the index of Dr McClish's aforementioned book:

  

> 
> > "Trautmann, Thomas R., 12, 40, 43, 50, 66-67, 72, 105, 125, 141" (page > 273 in the Kindle edition).
> > 

  

Best,

Megh
