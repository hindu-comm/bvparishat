I am not aware of who else has read Dr. Sihag's two books and Dr. Deodhar's book.

The depth of Dr. Sihag's comparative reading of *The Wealth of Nations* and*अर्थशास्त्र*is, in my limited view, without peer and precedent (and I am happy to be be corrected).  

Aspects of Dr. Sihag and Dr. Deodhar's work that seek to question 'received wisdom' in their respective domains, critiquing blindspots in those (broadly speaking, eurocentric) narratives by citing Indic precedents is something I find of value, irrespective of whether or not they are advancing a unique 'theory', per se.  

Constructive criticism can surely go a long way in ensuring greater precision and accuracy without losing sight of original contributions howeverincremental it might seem to anyone.
