I could, finally (and a few weeks ago), get access to Surendar Nath Mital's book*Kauṭilīya Arthaśāstra Revisited*, first published in 2000 (Centre for Studies in Civilizations)

*  
*

It appears to have recently become available again, for sale, on online platforms like Amazon.

  

This book joins my list of some rare books—which includes (*but is not limited to*) Bhagwan Singh-ji's *The Vedic Harappans* (first published in 1995), K.D. Sethna's *Problems of Ancient India* (first published in 2000),महामहोपाध्यायProfessor Korada Subrahmanyam's*Theories of Language: Oriental and Occidental* (2008) Michel Danino's*The Lost River: On The Trail Of The Sarasvati* (2010), Vishwa Adluri and Joydeep Bagchee's*The Nay Science*(2014)—that engage critically, empirically and respectfully with somehypotheses that appeared to have / appear to still carry currency in, amongst other places, at least some American universities.**

*  
*

At a little over 70 pages (pp. 69-141), Mital-ji's engagement withThomas Trauttman's hypothesis is the most elaborate and pointed critique of Dr Truattman's hypothesis that I have come across. Mital-ji's tables: I found them to be such a delight!

  

If anyone in this list is aware of Dr Trauttman's published acknowledgementof, or responseto, Mital-ji's work, and would be kind enoughto share pointers to that publication, I would really appreciate that; thank you.

  

At least in Indian universities, if not in other places, if Dr Trauttmann's hypothesis is being referred to, I hope Mital-ji's work is also discussed.I include below, a part of the index of Mital-ji's aforementioned book:
