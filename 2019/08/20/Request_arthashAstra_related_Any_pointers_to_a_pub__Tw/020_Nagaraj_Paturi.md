What Artha Sastra covers, in modern parlance, comes under statecraft / state administration. Those portions looking like Economics in Artha Shastra may come under State Finance or Government Finance or in modern parlance, Public Finance. Nevertheless Public Finance is a branch of Economics, but not Economics itself or the whole of Economics.
