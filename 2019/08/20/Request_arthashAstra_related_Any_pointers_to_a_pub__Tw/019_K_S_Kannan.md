I thank Dr. Nori for actually citing what I merely referred to in the *Artha-sastra.*

*  
*

While the text could certainly be legitimately studied from various angles,

**my only concern was** when critics/commentators of today

start off with nonsensical/commonsensical translations of key/technical words,

and end up caricaturing the original.

  

While they may be under the impression that they are presenting the author as great,

they may actually be ending up presenting him as grotesque.

  

While my apprehensions are impelled by  

a concern for due responsibility on the part of modern expositors,

they are by no means inspired by  

any aversion to newer approaches/novel perspectives.

  

A great work would, in the memorable words of Bhasa, after all be as:

***yathA yathA pramArjmi,***

***tatha tathojjvalataraM bhavis"yati!***  

  

Just to clarify.
