A pointed response to Dr. Balbir Singh Sihag's\* section 3.2 ***Requirements for establishing origin of Economics***and 3.8 ***Asrthashastraon Economics as a separate discipline***would interest me (atleast).

  

\*Massachusetts Institute of Technology (M.I.T.). Professor of Economics at University of Massachusetts for twenty two years and now Professor Emeritus of Economics (Source:<http://ignca.gov.in/invitations/About_the_speaker.pdf>)

  

Sincerely,

Megh
