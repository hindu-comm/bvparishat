I am surprised by all these papers treating Arthasastra as a treatise of Economics. In my view, it is more a manual of Public Administration, Foreign Affairs and Military affairs. Very little of "Economics" is encountered in the book.

  

Artha in the name refers to the wealth of kings - ie kingdoms. The other name of the book is more revealing: Dandaniti.
