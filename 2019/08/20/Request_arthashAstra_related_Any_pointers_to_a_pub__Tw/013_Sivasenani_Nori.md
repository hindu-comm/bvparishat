In the original post of Sri Megh Kalyanasundsram of Aug 2019there were certain aspects which triggered thoughts that Kautilya was misunderstood. For instance:

  

"It is also argued that Kautilya's The Arthashastra may be correctly designated as Dharmanomics: economics built on an ethical foundation, projecting economics and economic policy in a more meaningful and socially desirable perspective."

  

"Kautilya was the first economist who established economics as a separate discipline."

  

Today, I listened to the podcast and was surprised to learn that Prof. Deodhar is aware of Prof. Kangle's work on Arthasastra. Also in the podcast, Prof. Deodhar did not make objectionable remarks, beyond describing Meghadutam as an "epic" poem of Kalidasa. So it does not sound right to dismiss this work so perfunctorily.   

  

In these kind of talks (at 16 min, the audio was considerably longer than an 'elevator pitch') one expects to find the highlights and so might be justified in believing the contents of the podcast to be the highlights, selected by none other than the author himself. Let me list the examples given by the author in the talk. He talks about the principle of taxation, quoting Mahabharata (tax people in the way that a bee draws nectar from a flower) and Kalidasa (the Raghus take taxes, like the Sun takes moisture, only to return it manifold for the welfare of people); he quotes Panini and Kautilya talking about interest (according to the author, interest is viewed as a sin in the Western culture, for instance as represented by Shylock in "The Merchant of Venice", whereas it was accepted in the Indian culture and this shows that ancient India was superior in its understanding of the time value of money); that Kautilya recognized that interest should be proportional to risk; and that Kautilya argued for lower import duties on scarce items; that India recognized earth as the source of wealth and not wealth itself, unlike the West. Even, if all of this were correct, it sounds more like a compilation of mention of all aspects connected to Economics rather than show the outline of an Economic theory or settled positions on matters of Economics. And some of them are not accurate. For instance, take the claim of Prof. Deodhar that land by itself was never considered wealth and the first two sutras of the fifteenth adhikarana that Prof. Kannan referred to in his post:

मनुष्याणां वृत्तिरर्थः, मनुष्यवती भूमिरित्यर्थः ।१।।

तस्याः पृथिव्या लाभपालनोपायः शास्त्रमर्थशास्त्रमिति ।२।।

  

Having cited an inaccurate one, one should also cite an accurate and important claim. in 2.11, Kautilya lays down interest rates for four different activities - सपादपणा धर्म्या मासवृद्धिः पणशतस्य, पञ्चपणा व्यावहारिकी, दशपणा कान्तारगाणाम्, विंशतिपणा सामुद्राणाम्। (1.25% pm is the fair interest rate; 5% for trade; 10% for those passing through forests and 20% for those faring on the sea). This is indeed a valid observation because the principle of return being proportional to risk is a fundamental insight in Economics and that is clearly recorded by Kautilya; further, this has not been highlighted earlier, to the knowledge of the present reviewer knows. This shows the advantage of practitioners of different fields examining the ancient texts. In contrast to the focus of Prof. Deodhar, in the index of Prof. Kangle's translation, there is no entry for "interest" - so unimportant was the topic of interest to the index-maker.

  

Still one is left with the impression that this book does not make a solid case for Indian origin of Economics. As a contrast, if one were to attempt to write a book describing Panini as the father of Linguistics, one would be able to show both theories and settled positions in Panini and Patanjali and in many cases even trace the development from Patanjali to Saussure/Bloomfield to Chomsky to the present state. In sum, yes, "The Economic Sutra" is an attempt in the right direction; but the sample presented neither shows much promise nor entices a study of the book itself.
