Apart from the (obviously foolish) fancy and fashion to cite Western sources,

another ailment bedevils Indian scholarship - a systemic ailment, so to say:

the **absence of the counterpart of Jstor** - for the massive literature produced by Indian scholars

in their numerous journals for over a century easily, is hardly known, much less available to us.  

  

Not that many Indian scholars even earlier have not toed the Western line,

but even those who have tried then to grasp/absorb the Indian - which is to say, the Dharmic - spirit,

few though they be, are little known, and hardly accessible.  

  

A minimum knowledge of Sanskrit was easily expectable of Indian historians of the early/mid-20th century,

and too few, if any, of our modern historians are at ease handling Sanskrit (or even vernacular) sources.  

  

This must be remedied first;  

or else, each aspiring fresh scholar gropes his way  

and trudges in the ill-lit dharmic tract; and gets mauled or swallowed ineluctably  

by the aggressive and predatory Western counterpart.
