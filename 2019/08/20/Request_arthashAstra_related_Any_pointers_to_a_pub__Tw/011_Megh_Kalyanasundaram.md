Your observationsabout the IE piece, in particular, is (imho) revealing, Professor. Your last line and the point on Tantrayukti clearly resonate.

  

Generally speaking, an author might or might not indicate what her/his work is primarily about.

  

Even when s/he does so, it is possible that when seen from the lens/es which the author has not designated as primary, one could find more in it that might be useful.

  

It is perhaps not at all uncommon that a work is seen only from a particular (or a subset of all possible) lenses, which by itself is not an illegitimate pursuit, if rigorous.

  

Yet, it could be problematic at times when a text corpus is reduced to what remains when seen only through one lens (or a subset; I am thinking of 'caste' for example), particularly so (in my view atleast) when the lens deployedis different from what the author has designated as primary.

  

Dr. Deodhar's effort to read "economic" concepts in Sanskrit texts (not limited toअर्थशास्त्र), whilst not unprecedented, is something I found useful, in ways more than one.By way of one example, his identification of some attributions to non-Indic people/sources when there are Indic precedents is something I found revealing and instructive.

  

Best,

Megh
