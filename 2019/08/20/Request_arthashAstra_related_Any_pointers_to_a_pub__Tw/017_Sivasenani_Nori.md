Sir

  

I am in agreement with you that one ought not to lose sight of original contributions, however incremental they might be. I hope I have not lost sight of those.

  

When there are competing demands on one's time, one is forced to choose and that is why I had to form a view on whether to read this book or not.

  

Regards

Senani
