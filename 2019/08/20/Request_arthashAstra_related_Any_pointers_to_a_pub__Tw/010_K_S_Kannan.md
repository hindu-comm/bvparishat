Another glorious example of the havoc wrought by mistranslations.

Kautalya has clearly defined what is *artha*.

  

So comic, were it not also tragic , that  

long ago there was a central page article in the *Indian Express*,

the opening sentence of which had a remark to the effect that

"though Kautilya has called his work *Arthashastra*,  

he has failed to confine himself to Economics

and mixed up so many extraneous things" !

  

Obviously, the author has not looked into the most important final chapter  

(designated Tantrayukti, the metalinguistic section)

which opens with the definition of *artha*.

  

And yes, someone in our own list sought to know the meaning of *artha*,

\- asking which to choose between two *synonymous* expressions

("six of one, and half-a-dozen of the other" as they say)!

  

We may well nigh reinterpret the celebrated statement of Sankara  

as verily applying to semantics ! :

***artham anartham** bhAvaya nityam*.

  

(All that is said above is by no means meant to deny or decry  

the robust economic thought in *Artha-sastra.)*
