> "This book seeks to highlight the monumental contribution of Kautilya > to economic thought. The Arthashastra explicitly promotes the goals of > both artha (material wellbeing) and dharma (righteous behavior) as a > consistent whole and repudiates any deviation from them. A serious > attempt is made here to revise the currently accepted history of > economic thought. It is claimed that presentation of Kautilya's > original contributions should succeed in dispelling the deepseated > myth that economics originated during the eighteenth century and Adam > Smith was the founder of economics. A claim is only as good as the > arguments it stands on. For the first time, strong arguments are > provided by the author as to why Kautilya should be considered as the > founder of economics... . It is also argued that Kautilya's The > Arthashastra may be correctly designated as Dharmanomics: economics > built on an ethical foundation, projecting economics and economic > policy in a more meaningful and socially desirable perspective. The > book also shows that the Hindu civilization is not averse to economic > growth."

The factoring in of Moral Hazard, the question > of Ethics, acknowledging the fact that economics is about people. > Including Systemic Risk into accounting for costs and profits and > alleviating poverty. These are some of Kautilyas observations... . > They are all valid today, for the modern world. According to Abraham > Seidenberg (1962), mathematics originated in India earlier than > Babylonia, Egypt or Greece. Sidney Weintraub argues that the image of > economics in the western world changed as the image of mathematics > changed but without realising that the image of mathematics in the > west might have changed with the change in the theology/philosophy of > the church. CK Raju points out that theology or philosophy did not > change constantly in the Indian subcontinent. Mathematical > measurements are pre-Vedic here, beginning with the early Indus Valley > inhabitants which have continued through generations. Kautilya was the > first economist who established economics as a separate discipline, > developed a score of concepts and understood economy as a system with > its inter-linked elements. Kautilyas Arthashastra contains two parts: > the exchange theory and the conflict theory but both use mathematics > to enhance clarity of expression and statistical analysis for arriving > at the best possible policy-decisions under risky situations and > evaluations afterwards. This book argues why Kautilya is relevant to > modern-day policy-makers and why Ethics should be a part of the Indian > education content." >
