My essential idea is,  

when an author has declared unequivocally what his project is,

to make disparaging remarks about his work without reckoning first what his avowed objective was

is patently wrong.

  

Of course, one can legitimately make a study of a text from various angles otherwise,

without losing sight of the above.
