The ebooks produced bySriranga Digital are very well-made.

Also, note that on the online website/journal Prekshaa, all chapters/episodes from these volumes are being translated into English, with something new being published almost daily. You can find translations of these works by D. V. Gundappa at<https://www.prekshaa.in/d-v-gundappa>or more at<https://www.prekshaa.in/archive?field_author_article_target_id=8697>

They are a joy to read and make the period being described very real, with a lot of colourful profiles of impressive personalities -- highly recommended.
