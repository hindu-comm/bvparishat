Interesting question.

  

I haven't looked at the originals closely but I think the English translations must be pretty close to the original text. (Bearing in mind of course that the purpose of a translation effort such as this one is to be accessible to an audience not familiar with the original language, so it is more important for the translation to be readable and to flow smoothly than to be perfectly literal.)

  

Note that the translations are done by several different translators; yet I have not noticed major differences in style. I think this is because of the editorial team at Prekshaa.in who are doing a good job and checking things carefully.  

  

For concrete examples, you can compare a few chapters of the originals (from the free samples available online) against the translations on Prekshaa.in:

  

Volume 1,ಸಾಹಿತಿ ಸಜ್ಜನ ಸಾರ್ವಜನಿಕರು (Sahiti Sajjana Sarvajanikaru):

1.ಕೆ. ರಾಮಚಂದ್ರರಾಯರವರು (K Ramachandra Rao): [Original](https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=zkZxDwAAQBAJ&hl=en_GB&pg=GBS.PT25.w.2.0.42), [Translation](https://www.prekshaa.in/k-ramachandra-rao-1865-1929)

2.ಕೆ.ಎ.ಕೃಷ್ಣಸ್ವಾಮಿಅಯ್ಯರ್ (K A Krishnaswamy Iyer): [Original](https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=zkZxDwAAQBAJ&hl=en_GB&pg=GBS.PT33),[Translation](https://www.prekshaa.in/k-krishnaswamy-iyer-vedantin-and-violinist)

5\. [Original](https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=zkZxDwAAQBAJ&hl=en_GB&pg=GBS.PT63), Translation [Part 1](https://www.prekshaa.in/h-v-nanjundaiah-1860-1920-part-1), [Part 2](https://www.prekshaa.in/h-v-nanjundaiah-1860-1920-part-2)

  

Volume 2, Kalopasakaru:

1.ನಾಟ್ಯಕಲೆಯಗೌರವಾರ್ಹತೆ (Respectability of the Art of Dance): [Original](https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=zEZxDwAAQBAJ&hl=en_GB&pg=GBS.PT10.w.0.0.0.2), Translation[Part 1](https://www.prekshaa.in/Respectability_of_the_Art_of_Dance)[Part 2](https://www.prekshaa.in/Respectability_of_the_Art_of_Dance_Part2)(2019 July/August)  

3.ಬೆಂಗಳೂರುನಾಗರತ್ನಮ್ಮ (Bangalore Nagarathnamma): [Original](https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=zEZxDwAAQBAJ&hl=en_GB&pg=GBS.PT31.w.0.0.0.1), [Translation](https://www.prekshaa.in/bangalore-nagarathnamma/)(2016). (Incidentally, [here's](https://web.archive.org/web/20170226142315/http://grahana.net:80/394/dv-gundappas-memoirs-bangalore-nagaratnamma) an independent translation done by a different author on a different site so you can compare the two English translations even if you can't read Kannada.)

  

\[And so on; you can repeat the exercise with other volumes but I exceeded the time I allowed myself to reply to this. :-)\]
