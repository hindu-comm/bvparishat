Dear Shreevatsa,

  

It is so nice and kind of you that you have introduced so well the humble efforts of prekshaa to this forum of learned people. Yes, the editorial team, especially Sri. Hari Ravikumar has spared no effort of him in this regard. We should also profusely thank Dr. S. R. Ramaswamy, the only living direct student of DVG and presently Hon. Secretary of GIPA, the pioneering institution working for the cause of our country and culture. He is the person who scribed all these volumes, saw to it that they were well printed with lot of useful appendices and suitable photographs.

  

I hope that preekshaa would complete the task of translating all the volumes by the end of 2020. I also request the literary world to support this colossal endeavor.

  

With utmost respectful regards

  

Ganesh
