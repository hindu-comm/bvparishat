Respected Bipinji.  
Namastey  
  
Sanskrit is rapidly being revived in India and Europe. Samskrita Bharati, Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan, Vyoma Labs, Madras Sanskrit College and many organisations in India have started apt and well-designed courses for sincere students.  
  
The premier engineering colleges IITs have an acharya module to cater to learners.  
  
Ayurveda and Yoga have become familiar words for the common man all across the globe.  
  
Even few members of Parliament have taken oath in Sanskrit.  
  
World renowned saints Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, Sadhguru, etc. and Spiritual ashrams like Aurobindo Ashram, Ramakrishna Math, Chinmay Mission, Arsha Vidya Gurukul, Shivananda Ashram etc. frequently use Sanskrit terms and verses in their everyday discourses.  
  
We are sure to witness a steady and wholesome revival of Sanskrit that shall empower students to obtain jobs and livelihood that are at par with the best.  
  
Jai Gurudev  
Ashwini
