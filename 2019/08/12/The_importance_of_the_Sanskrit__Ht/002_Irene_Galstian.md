Sir,  
  
The phrase "in this competition-age" in your post might be interpreted  
as if you take this as a fact. It's not a fact, it's a condition some  
choose to accept and others choose to pass by. For those who live  
their incarnation in inner balance, things have always been excellent  
for Sanskrit and will continue to be. And without Sanskrit they will  
also be wonderful, believe it or not.  
As for those who accept the rat-race, Sanskrit won't come and rescue  
them from the prison of their perceptions, only they themselves can do  
that.  
  
Irene
