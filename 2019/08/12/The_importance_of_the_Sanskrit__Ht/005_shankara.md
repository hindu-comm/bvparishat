Namaste,

  

This topic has been discussed before in BVP. Please search the archives.  

  

In case you haven't already seen there is a talk by Shri. Kutumba Sastry on 'Why we need to learn Sanskrit?'.

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6AtcTffq6s>

  

Dr. V. Raghavan's book on Sanskrit language and literature also might be helpful.

regards  
shankara

Sir,

I am agree with you but as an instructor it is our duty to learn more and more about Sanskrit with references that may be factual, so that we may convey a clear message to them who wish to opt Sanskrit.

  

No doubt Sanskrit is the back-bone of world peace but we need to clarify to those students who have different background and a lot of options as a subject. We need to respect their spirit too.
