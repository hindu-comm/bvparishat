Sir,

I am agree with you but as an instructor it is our duty to learn more and more about Sanskrit with references that may be factual, so that we may convey a clear message to them who wish to opt Sanskrit.

  

No doubt Sanskrit is the back-bone of world peace but we need to clarify to those students who have different background and a lot of options as a subject. We need to respect their spirit too.
