Dear Vidvans,

  

I read somewhere that a text was found in Srilanka which was purportedly authored by Kumbhakarna the brother of Ravana on the subject of Yoganidra.

  

Unfortunately I do not remember the source of this assertion now. This came to me suddenly and I wonder if anyone here has come across this or any other traditional text on this subject of Yoga Nidra.

  

Thanks,

  

Regards,

  

Venkat
