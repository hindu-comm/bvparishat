I went into the BVP archives to look for a thread I remember of a Yoga Sutra book version with a different number of sutras than in the established one.

  

The PDF was also shared.

  

Most sutras in that version turned out to be around breath control.

  

Does anyone remember? Can anyone help me locate it?
