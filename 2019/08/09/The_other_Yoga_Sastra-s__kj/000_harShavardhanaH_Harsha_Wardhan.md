Namaskar to all,

  

Apart from the Yoga Sutra of Patanjali, there are mentions of some other yoga sastra-s at various places in our scriptures and texts.

  

These yoga shastra-s are lost, but here and there, some stray verses are quoted.

  

I am not finding much information on them.

  

May I request scholars here to consider sharing any information or papers or verses or texts they are working on or acquainted with or are aware of in this regard.

  

  

with kind regards

Harsha
