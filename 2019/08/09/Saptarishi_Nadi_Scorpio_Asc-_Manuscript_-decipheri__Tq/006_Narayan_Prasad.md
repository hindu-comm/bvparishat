\<\<i am typing Tamil script in phonetic keyboard, so some pronunciation and accurate letters are may be wrong\>\>

  

If you wish, I can give you an editor (cut and paste type) through which you can type in Tamil without problem.

I have made provision for almost all the important Indian scripts. With it you could type in Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam also.

If you want, you can modify just the text file to change the English specific key how to type a certain Tamil character.

  
Thanks and regards

Narayan Prasad
