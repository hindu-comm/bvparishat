Dear All

  

After the #Grateful2Gurus program, we are immensely happy to announce a Grants Scheme for holding Memorial Lectures in honour of venerable Scholars who are no longer amidst us.

  

If you are the offspring or a direct student and would like to organise a memorial lecture please write to us.

  

More details can be found here.
