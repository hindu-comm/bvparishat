Iyengarji,

  

It seems dharmasutra of Harita is lost and only fragments of it remain today.  

  

Please refer to page 38, footnote 209 of Dharmasastra and Judicial Literature in HIL series.

<https://archive.org/details/DharmashastraAndJudicialLitDerrett/page/n42>

  

Fragments of Haritadharmasutra have been compiled and published by T.R. Chintamani and S.C. Banerji. T.R. Chintamani's compilation was published in JOR, Madras vol 8 in 1936. I could not locate this volume online.  

  

regards  
shankara
