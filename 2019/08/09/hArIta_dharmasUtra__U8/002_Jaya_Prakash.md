Hello Iyengar Sir,

  

The point which you are referring just got this link \[<https://books.google.co.in/books?id=idERT6Tg4MMC&pg=PA39&lpg=PA39&dq=harita+dharma+sutra&source=bl&ots=U_rRM486NO&sig=ACfU3U1troEKPF9UceIQmuNTkao2s4PC9Q&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjr3sugp_bjAhVymuYKHQKBAJc4ChDoATADegQIBBAB#v=onepage&q=harita%20dharma%20sutra&f=false>\]relating to "sacred thread ceremony" for women's mentioned in HDS and Veda.

  

Thanks and Regards

Jaya Prakash
