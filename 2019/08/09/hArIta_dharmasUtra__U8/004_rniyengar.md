Let me first thank Sri Shankar, Sri Prakash for immediate response. Thanks to Prof.Aklujkar for further information. The Mss at upenn is about stree-dharma; but I could not locate statements about Upanayana in first browsing. I may have to search again. My query arose due to the following reasons:

  

1.Smritichandrika (Mysore Edition) quoting Harita in sutra form:

p62, यत्तु**हारितेनोक्तम्**—

> 
> > “द्विविधास्स्त्रियो ब्रह्मवादिन्यस्सद्योवध्वश्च ।
> > 
> > 
> > तत्र ब्रह्मवादिनीनामुपनयनमग्नीन्धनं वेदाध्ययनं स्व गृहे च > भिक्षाचार्येति ।
> > 
> > 
> > सद्योवधूनां चोपस्थिते विवाहे कथंचिदुपनयनमात्रं कृत्वा विवाहः कार्यः॥” > इति । >
> 

This is collected by SC Banerjee in his reconstruction. I have not yet seen TR Chintamani.

  

2\. J.Jolly claims to have seen the Sutra text lent to him by Bhuler, who had obtained the Mss from Pt.Vamana Shastri. The upenn Mss linked by Jayaprakash ji does not look like the one known to Jolly. Please see attached the Note of Jolly. The original may still be somewhere in Europe?

  

3.Smritichandrika further says this was an ancient practice and quotes Yama-smriti (Is this available in print?)

तत्कल्पान्तराभिप्रायम् । तथा च**यमः**—

> 
> > “पुरा कल्पे तु नारीणां मौञ्जीबन्धनमिष्यते।अध्यापनं च वेदानां > सावित्रीवचनं तथा॥ >
> 
> > 
> > पिता पितृव्यो भ्राता वा नैनामध्यापयेत्परः।स्वगृहे चैव कन्याया > भैक्षचर्या विधीयते॥ >
> 
> > 
> > वर्जयेदाजिनं चीरं जटाधारणमेव च।” इति । >
> 



The kalpa here can not be taken in terms of yuga, manvantara, kalpa of PuraaNas. This could only mean some ancient forgotten period. *Kanyopanayanam* is recommended to be carried out under krittika nakshatra in a text we are editing at CAHC.

I feel research into such questions is important for understanding our own Cultural History.

  

Thanks
