Dear Members; Dear Shankar ji

I am interested in getting a copy of theहारीत धर्मसूत्र (HDS). I could not locate any link on the web.

  

There is a reconstructed text of this name by SC Banerjee available at [archive.org](http://archive.org). I am not sure whether this is complete and authentic.

As early as in 1896 J.Jolly (Indian Antiquary p. 148, Book Notice) wrote about a manuscript of HDS found by Vamana Shastri Islampurkar. Has this been published by Jolly or others? Smriti and Samhita in the name of Harita are easily available. I read somewhere that HDS authoritatively differentiates between सद्योवधू and ब्रह्मवादिनी interms of उपनयनसंस्कार. Hence my interest.

Regards

RN Iyengar
