There was and possibly still is a research centre in the Sanskrit Department at Jodhpur University, Rajasthan, named after Madhusudan Oza. You may inquire there.

  

I had visited it in 2005 and Dr.Ganeshilal Suthar was its Head or Director/Professor. He must have retired now,but,the centre might be working,no idea.  

  

Best wishes for your search.
