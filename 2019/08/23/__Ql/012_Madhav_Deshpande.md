V. Raghavan's critical edition of Bhoja's Śr̥ṅgāra-Prakāśa was published in 1998 in the Harvard Oriental Series, Vol 53. A newer edition has been edited in two volumes by Professor Reva Prasad Dwivedi (IGNCA, 2007). There are several other older editions, but none with a commentary as faras I can tell.
