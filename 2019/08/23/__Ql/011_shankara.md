Namaste,

  

Dr. V. Raghavan's thesis on Sringaraprakasa is available online at

<https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.481672/page/n882>

  

Dr Raghavan's work is a critical study of Sringaraprakasa. It seems he did not either edit the text or write a commentary on it.  

  

PV Kane and SK De too (in History of Sanskrit Poetics) don't mention any commentaries on Sringaraprakasa.
