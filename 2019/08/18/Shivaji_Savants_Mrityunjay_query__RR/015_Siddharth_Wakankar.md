I dont think so.

  

There are many books in Marathi dealing with different characters of Mahabharat,[esp.by](http://esp.by) Shankar Damodar Pendse.His book is titled, महाभारतातील व्यक्तिदर्शन,wherein he discusses many important characters, males as well as females.The scholarly books by Balshastri Hardas on Ramayana, Mahabharat etc.fall in this category,but,I don't think anybody has tried his/ her hand at translating those voluminous and excellently written books. Those books came in the 1960-80 timeframe.
