Dear Professor Deshpande,  
  
Thank you for this reference. I confess that I didn't get far into the  
Marathi original with my Hindi, so to read something in Marathi  
comfortably I'll need to get used to the language a bit more. However,  
the tendency to glorify Karna is interesting enough that I'll probably  
end up scraping together enough Marathi to get on with the novel;  
finding the Hindi translation would help a lot with this. Plus, in the  
process of working on the app and linking dictionaries to it, my own  
Marathi can only improve.  
  
Best wishes,  
Irene
