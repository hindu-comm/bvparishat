Dear Prasad ji, 

  

Thank you, I’ll try to find this book, while my Marathi is working its way up to the level required to read Professor Deshpande’s recommendation.

  

In the meantime, may I ask you and other members of the list to express their own perception of Karna and their own interpretation of where this strength of sympathy for Karna comes from.

  

Best wishes,

Irene
