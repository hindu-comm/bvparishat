I apologise for a query that's only obliquely Sanskrit related, but  
I'm not sure what else to try.  
I've been getting together various translations of the above novel to  
create an app for small group use, but can't find the full Hindi and  
Kannada versions. If anyone knows where I can buy these, please reply  
(ideally I'd be after ebooks, since it's not easy to get booksellers  
to ship to the UK). Interlibrary loans didn't help here because I  
requested the Hindi translation, but the lending library sent the  
Marathi original, which I already have.  
  
Thank you,  
Irene
