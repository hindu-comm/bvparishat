Dr Prasad,

  

This is very kind, thank you!

Today I’ll be receiving an email from our library about the incorrectly supplied interlibrary loan. If they are unwilling or unable to locate for the correct book, I’ll write to you, and we’ll pursue your plan. However, in this case a key point is how am I going to pay you back for the book and the postage. Do you have a PayPal account? If not, do you live near any Western Union customer service point?

  

Thanks again,

Irene
