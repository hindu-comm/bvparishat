\<\<can't find the full Hindi andKannada versions. If anyone knows where I can buy these>\>

  

If you are interested in the Hindi translation ofShivaji Savant's Mrityunjay, I could make inquiry at Pune bookstalls. If available, I can request the bookseller to ship it to UK, and if he is unable to send it, I can purchase a copy and send it to you.

Regards

Narayan Prasad
