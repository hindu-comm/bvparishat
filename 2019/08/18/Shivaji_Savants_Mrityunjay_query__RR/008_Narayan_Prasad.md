Dear Dr Irene,

 You need not bother about the payment.

 First please let me know whether the book is required from India or not. After confirmation, I will go to the bookstalls (situated about 15 km away from my residence) and make inquiry whether the book is available in Hindi translation for sale.

 I stayed at Oxford for nine months during 1988-89. During the same period, I had the chance to see the newly published Oxford English Dictionary.

 I am a graduate in Engineering and have already retired. I have not done PhD. So addressing by "Mr" would be enough.

 Regards

 Narayan Prasad
