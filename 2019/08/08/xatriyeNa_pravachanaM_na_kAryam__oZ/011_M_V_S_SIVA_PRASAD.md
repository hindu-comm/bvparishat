Respected scholars  
I have a query here . The shatkarmas are given only to brahmin by that a Kshatriya may not give a cermon. But the purana speaker Suta himself a sudra and he has given open cermons on puranam in the Yagna vatika only.  
I want to know what's the stand of kumarila on this issue then ?  
Honestly I don't believe in the above translation. I feel May be someone misinterpreted it while tranlating.  
The scholar of vedavedangas and the nyaya, mimamsa the kumarila bhatta definitely have the knowledge of that . Hence I feel the translator was wrong.  
{Even this issue arose in the case of Vivekananda too. After coming to india he stated in the kerala speech that he is a Kshatriya and he has a right } .  
So please i want an elaborative views on this depending on sastras.  
Thank you
