Namaste

I read somewhere in Manu Smruti it is said a Brahmin can learn from lower Varna teacher only if he cannot find a Brahmin teacher. If Brahmin is available he must learn from him only and not choose lower Varna teacher. Your examples and from others in Mahabharata may be following this rule. Krishna teaching Geeta example is different because He is Bhagavan Svayam. Varna rules will not apply to Him.
