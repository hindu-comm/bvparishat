Dear scholars!

I came across this statement in Prof. M. P. Sankunni Nair 's work "Chatravum cāmaravum", a critique on Kalidasa (in Malayalam ), that Kumarilabhațța has somewhere made a remark Buddha, being a kşatriya, violated the dharmānuśāsana by preaching ( प्रवचनं ब्राह्मणधर्मः).

Could anybody please help me locate passage of Kumarilabhațța?
