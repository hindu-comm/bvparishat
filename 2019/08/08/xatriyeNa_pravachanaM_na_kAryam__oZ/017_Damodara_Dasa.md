Hare Krishna.  
  
Respected Vidvaj-janas,  
  
Here is something to look into:  
  
Srimad Bhagavatam 7.11.14,  
viprasyādhyayanādīni ṣaḍ-anyasyāpratigrahaḥ  
rājño vṛttiḥ prajā-goptur aviprād vā karādibhiḥ  
  
Here it seems that except accepting charity (pratigraha) all other 5  
duties ksatriya can do.  
  
However, commentators like Sridhara Swami clarifies that adhyapana and  
yAjana can be done by ksatriyas but without accepting remuneration;  
because of this apratigraha word is used.  
  
Please see the attached pdf file for detailed commentaries on this verse.  
  
Thankyou,  
Hari Guru Vaisnava das,  
Damodara Das
