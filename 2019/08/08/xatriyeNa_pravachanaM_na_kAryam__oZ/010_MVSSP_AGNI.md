Respected scholars

         I feel the translator is wrong. He mis interpreted the kumarila bhat.

  

1\. 6 karmas are for the brahmins .

2\. Buddha gas done which not his karma. It is a questionable one. In the satra yaga the suta had given puran pravachan. The vedic rushis accepted it.

Kumarila bhatta is definitely aware of it.

3\. Buddha had his own interpretation of his practical knowledge after enlightenment and he told that . He never took any holy hindu books like upanishads etc. and explained them. So we cant use the word of adhyapana w.r.t. the vedic mode here .

So i feel the translator comitted a wrong while interesting kumarila bhatta here.

  

Scholars are requested for clarification.

  

Thank you.
