Namaste

  

If by 'pravachanam' giving out the teaching of Brahmavidya or other dharma-s to a shrotaa, then we have many examples:

  

Ajatashatru, a Kshatriya, teaches Brahmavidya to Baalaaki - Brihadaranyaka Upanishad.

  

Janaka teaching Brahmavidya to Shuka, etc.

  

Bhishma teaching moksha dharma, varnashrama dharma, etc. to Yudhishthira..

  

Not sure what exactly is meant by 'pravachanam.'

  

warm regards
