Namaste,

  

Many suggest that Kshatriyas did not teach the veda etc and left that job to the brahmanas. Many quote the example of Bhishma leaving the training of the kauravas and the pandavas to Kṛpa and Droṇa in support of this. However even in the vedic age this is shown to not be strictly true. Pradyumna is shown to have been Guru to Abhimanyu and the upapandavas in Dhanurveda. So also Arjuna a kshatriya instructs a Gandharva in the mantras for the agneyastra---> which is sourced directly from the veda proper.

We can split hairs in saying that this was not strictly knowledge of Brahman that was being transmitted, but the fact remains that certain parts of the Veda were taught by kshatriyas without regard for division of labour.

  

In giving the other examples you probably overlooked the most famous example of all:

  

Kṛṣṇa's pravachana of Bhagavat Gita to Arjuna.

  

Both the vakta and the śrota are kṣatriyas by varṇa and the pravachana happens in a battlefield of all places, in the midst of two armies.

I think the key here is kṛṣṇa's later statement in the anu gita that He had centered Himself in Yoga before transmitting the BG to arjuna. In keeping with this, the vakta's words are prefaced with śri bhagavan uvacha...

So also although Jada Bharata was a born "Brahmin" he did not have any of the karmas or samskaras of one (as given in the SB) and yet when he addresses King Rahuguṇa...Brahmaṇa uvacha....is how the narrative starts.

  
In other places similarly the vakta's main character is one of brahmaṇyam as opposed to his varna by birth or karma. I do not therefore see a contradiction here.

  

My 2 cents,

  

Regards,

  

V
