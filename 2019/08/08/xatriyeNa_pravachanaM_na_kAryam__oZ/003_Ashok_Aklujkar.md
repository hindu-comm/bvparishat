The derivatives of pra+vac seem to have a more specific sense in earlier or āstika tradition. See the discussion of prokta in Yudhiṣṭhira Mīmāṁsaka, Saṁskṛta Vyākaraṇa kā Itihāsa, vol. 1, p. 266 (edition 4 of saṁvat 2041).

  

(The earlier editions of this monumental work also have a discussion of prokta; so also the booklet, Ācārya Pāṇini ke Samaya Vidyamāna Saṁskṛta Vāṅmaya, by the same author.\]

  

The later usage retains the meaning element ‘exposition,’ but does not always contain the element/supposition recast/revision by a nirahaṁkāra or nīrajas-tama person — by a person the smṛtikāras or dharmaśāstrakāras would consider ideal Brāhmaṇa’.

  

A remark matching the one quoted as coming from Kumārila may be found in the Tantra-vārttika, which has a relatively long critique of the Buddhists and the Jainas.
