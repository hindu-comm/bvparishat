Namaste



On \< Buddha, being a kşatriya, violated the dharmānuśāsana by preaching
( प्रवचनं ब्राह्मणधर्मः) \> as noted by Prof. Aklujkar, does have more specific sense/s in earlier and astika -practicing traditions. A simplistic translation of the vedic Samskruth term with a sweeping mount of ' populist Vedanta' overcoat will lead to inaccurate presentation of tradition and teaching from the text. Here below is the reasoning for this statement. Also, when the text-constructor picks personal choice of meaning, violating the ' source work context, intent and living practices', the outcome is 'harming tradition'.



It would also be interesting to explore 'Buddha's Kshatriya tag' in the light of ' Buddha as one of ten Vishnu avataras, along side Sri Krishna'. 



***Summary*** : The vedic text and terms need deeper contemplation beyond a simplistic presentation for lay audience.



1. In 1903, Mahadeva Sastry in his work THE TAITTIRIYA UPANISHAD with commentaries ( <http://www.srimatham.com/uploads/5/5/4/9/5549439/taittiriya_upanisad.pdf> )

translates ' pravachana' in alternate modes and keeps the section heading as 'The works incumbent on an Upāsaka.'

The relevant extract reads as follows: What ‘the right' is, has been already explained. The right and the other duties to be mentioned below should be practiced, as well as

Svadhyāya, the learning of one's own Veda, and **Pravachana, which means either Adhyāpana, the teaching of it, or Brahma- Yajña, a daily solemn recitation of it.** The meaning

of 'the true' has been already explained along with ‘the right’. Or the ‘true’ may mean truth-speaking. ( See image attached).



 Swami Sharvananda also presents multiple meanings for 'pravachana' not limited to any specific varnas. (<http://estudantedavedanta.net/Taittiriya%20Upanishad%20-%20Swami%20Sarvanand%20%5BSanskrit-English%5D.pdf>)



2. Pravachana is connected with Vak-yoga: By taittiriya upanishad context ,the fourth anuvaka of taittiriya provides the introduction of text as common **to all ' brahmacharin's'** - **without limiting to ' specific varnas**. The ninth anuvaka, where the term ' **pravachana' occurs has 12 frames in which the practice of pravachana needs to be interpreted for instruction and practice culminating as 'Tapas'.**



 If we connect the root 'vac' of ' pra-vachana' with 'tapas' in Taittiriya upanishad, and connect it to Gita (17-15), the outcome practice instruction is 'Tapas which is connected with 'Vak/ vachana/ pravachana'. In other words, it is connecting 'Yoga in the form of Tapas' with 'pra-vachana / pra-vak' . pra-vak is another vedic term of significance to follow in connection with the tradition of 'Vak- Yoga'.
