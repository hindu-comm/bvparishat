Namaste.

  

A nice explanation, indeed.

  

However, if one is a saadhaka, until the social self is reformed/disappeared, it becomes inevitable for one to afford it at the cost of twisted realities to forego the satyatva of 'vyavahaara.' To equate social self with the true self, one should become like that sannyasi in a story, who was repeatedly stung by a scorpion while he tries to equate it with his true self. I wonder, what if it were a snake.

  

I feel, such a saadhana demands context dynamics.
