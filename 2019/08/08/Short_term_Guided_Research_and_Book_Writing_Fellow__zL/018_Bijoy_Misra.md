While Kashmir as an entity has been integral to India in culture, thoughts and religion,

the Islamization possibly did create the rift as it did in Pakistan. I believe that Islamization

did create a division to initiate a separate cultural identity through religion. Pakistan though

formed remains unstable and its instability causes murmurs in Kashmir.
Hopefully the new

move by India would restore Kashmir valley to its magnificent scholarly past.
