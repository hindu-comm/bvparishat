Sir,

  

A very timely decision of IGUC to sponsor works on intellectual contributions related to Kashmir! Recently, the country has witnessed a greatest political achievement in the annals of Indian history.

  

I believe, you may certainly get good responses with solid proposals.  

All our best wishes.

  

Regards
