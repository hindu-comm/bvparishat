I applaud this announcement from IGUC.

Thank you Paturi-ji.

Yesterday, I watched a Video on Adi Sankarachary, where he bows down to a Chandala who asked why he should move away when there is no difference between their atmas.

It has been alluded that Shiva came in the form of Chandala.

Is there a detailed account of this meeting in the shastras?
