Sri Deva Pattanayak-ji,

  

As you mentioned, it is a story and as such does not come from Shaastra books.

  

It is mentioned in Shankara Vijaya which is a hagiography , a religious biography of Shankaracharya.

  

Hagiographies may help a historian . But everything in it might not be historically accurate.

  

But the point being made through the story is that a person with a true spiritual experience has equanimity.

  

Social self is different from spiritual self. Social self is the container and spiritual self is the contained.

  

True spiritually enlightened person does not care for the container but cares only for the contained.
