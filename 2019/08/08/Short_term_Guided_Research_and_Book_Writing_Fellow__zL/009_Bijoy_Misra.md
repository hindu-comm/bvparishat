In the '70s I was a voracious reader of western contributions to India.

Afterwards I had the occasion to read some of the papers where I was

disturbed by noticing inference by correlation. While the British science

is known for some fundamental analytic work, many second rate people

were dispatched to the colonies who tried to make studies through  

extremely superficial and unscientific correlations. I am finding them

though our work here for the British period in India through our studies

in India Discovery Center. The correlation legacy continues in many

quarters still. The correlation assumes a false standard. A school

gets created on a hunch published in a glossy book. A massive

reorientation would be required to escape the hunch. The researchers  

may lack the stamina and the diligence to dig in order to understand.  

Understanding would need to throw away some of the vested knowledge.  

In turn, the researchers become opinionated journalists!

  

PS. Yes, I do denounce the correlation science of BrhadSamhita,

but that was 5th century AD.
