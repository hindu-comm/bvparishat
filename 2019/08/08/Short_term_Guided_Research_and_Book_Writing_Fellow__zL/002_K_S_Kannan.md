A thought of a revisit to the issue occurred to me too.

Which is why I sent the links of the Sanskrit book *kashmiretihasa* and one or two others.

  

The resounding silence regarding, or equally, trivialisation of, the gravity of the matter  

as some "fire accident" by many insolent Western Indologists (such as
Prof Sheldon Pollock),  

in respect of the wanton and ruthless destruction and devastation (even of libraries)  

wrought by the Muslim barbarians can be no less barbaric : The issue has been dealt with  

here and there in some of the Swadeshi Indology volumes (edited by me).  

  

Prof. Arvind Sharma has given a picturesque description of "the perfect genocide".

  

Great, and timely, of IGUC to have taken the issue up and sponsor/inspire writing  

on the pertinent and important theme.
