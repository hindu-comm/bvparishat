**Indic Academy’s Inter Gurukula University Centre announces**

**Short term Guided Research and Book Writing Fellowships On Kashmir**

  

Today Indian nation is celebrating the steps taken by Government of India to remove the hurdles to the development of Kashmir as an integral part of India.On this occasion Indic Academy ‘s Inter Gurukula university Centre (IGUC) notes with pride how Bharatiya Vidwans are celebrating the occasion in their own way by reminding the nation how
premodern Sanskrit and other IndianLiterature articulated how much Kashmir and Kashmiris always meant and mean to India and vice versa.

IGUC wishes to join these celebrations by announcing three Short term Guided Research and Book Writing Fellowships of Rs 30,000/- each with a three months duration for each.

Scholars , research students, public intellectuals and /or anyone who is interested in writing a well researched book on this topic may send their Statement of Interest along with their profile to IGUC at[Nam...@Indica.org.in]().

IGUC suggests the following topics for the books:

1.**Shankara, Advaita and Kashmir**: It is well known that Kashmir forms part of the Shankara’s geo-cultural oneness vision of Bharat. It is also well known that Mata Sarada of Sarada Peeth of Kashmir is very significant part of Sankara’s vision. Sarada is an important deity in all the Sankara Peethas and Mathas. Kashmir has always been a cradle of various strands of Advaita. 

**2**.**Abhinava Gupta ‘s influence beyond Kashmir**: One of the monumental icons of ancient India’s intellectual achievements Abhinava Gupta and his contribution through his big number of books to multiple fields of theory and practice does not need a new introduction. A book focusing specifically on the influence of his contributions in all these fields on the intellectual, spiritual and cultural traditions of India is the need of the hour.

3.**Tirthas and Kshetras of Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh in oral and written literature**: It is well known that Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh hold an intense sacral significance to Indians and that significance is very well expressed through various works of oral and written literary works in Sanskrit and other Indian languages. A book compiling and analyzing all such expressions at one place is long overdue.

These topics are only indicative.Scholars , research students, public intellectuals and /or anyone who is interested in writing a well researched book celebrating the occasion may come up with other topics highlighting how premodern Sanskrit and other IndianLiterature articulated how much Kashmir and Kashmiris always meant and mean to India and vice versa.

Fellowship begins from the 1^(st)Sptember, 2019.

Last date for sending the Statements of Interest with profiles is 20^(th)August, 2019.
