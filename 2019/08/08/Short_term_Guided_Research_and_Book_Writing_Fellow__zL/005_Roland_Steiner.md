I will not enter into a debate about current political developments.  
Instead, I recommend those who are interested in historical research  
on medieval Kashmir to read the following article by Walter Slaje:  
  
Medieval Kashmir and the Science of History. (South Asia Institute.  
College of Liberal Arts. The University of Texas at Austin. Madden  
Lecture 2003–4. Ed. by Patrick Olivelle). Austin 2004.
