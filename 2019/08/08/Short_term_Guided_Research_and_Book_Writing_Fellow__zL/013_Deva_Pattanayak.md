Dear Paturi-ji,

Namaste. Following your concepts of social self and spiritual self. Will prefere to use true self over spiritual self.

The challenge is how to develop the social self because true self is adwaita meaning one unchangeable and is self expressed.

Social self is not well defined. According to the famous story (tini tundare cheli kukura, three pronouncements can turn a goat into a dog),
social self can be falsely created.

One can create a social image of oneself which is asat, not true.

Social self as the term denotes depends on the society, the three tundas (voices).

A well dressed ‘Chandala’ will have a different social self especially when endowed with knowledge and wealth.

The thing to ponder is what happens when society comes to know of his or her parents.

I do sincerely hope society understands that the social self being asat comes in many different colors(Varnas).

Let all know that the true self is sat and not discriminate or brand according to the social self.

Let us show respect to each other and not make derogatory comments on each other solely based on a self created higher pulpit.

There is s need to know the true self and stay away from fighting with each other’s social self.

Thank you for contrasting social self to spiritual self which has deep implication for an individual and society today and tomorrow.

With best regards

Deva
