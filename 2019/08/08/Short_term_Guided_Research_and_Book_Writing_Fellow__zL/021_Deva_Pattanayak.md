Geographically Kashmir is contiguous with Bharat Varsha and being close to mighty Himalyas is seat of many ashrams. 

It is a step in theright direction that the temporary provisions in the constitution of the republic of Bharat is now removed.

A economically and socially united entity encompassing many states in that region will be beneficial and in years to come will  be a reality. Intrinsically human beings are driven by manav dharma which is eternal(sanatan) and ever evolving through cycles of yugas(cyclic time periods)

Please note that the other constitutional name of India is Bharat which when used transcends the narrow english language name India by which Bharat is commonly known now.

Long live Bharat!
