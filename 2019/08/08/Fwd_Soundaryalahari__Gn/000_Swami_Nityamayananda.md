Namaste,

  

I am reading a transcription of talk given on the Soundaryalahari by Kanchi Paramacharya. In that he mentions that there is a manuscript in the library at Philadelphia in which paintings of Divine Mother is available depicting each stanza.

  

Is this rare work available in a soft-copy at [archive.org](http://archive.org) or in the internet? Kindly share the link if it has one.
