Sir,

  

The Oriental Institute,Baroda, has a very rare and colourful and illustrated ms.of Saundryalahari,which they have published in the recent past.

  

It is possibly the only complete ms.with 105 verses accompanied by 105 pictures.

  

You may contact the authorities of the Oriental Institute, Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda, Vadodara, Gujarat. Tel no.0265-2425121.

  

Best of luck in your quest.  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
