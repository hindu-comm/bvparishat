Dear scholars

about first verse of scorpio saptarishi nadi, which I have mentioned as "I written"-  

My intention is written below is-only.

Actually that's sent by Sri Madhivanan, who is written that.

I'm working on Scorpio Asc,to extract some techniques from that manuscript, I don't want total translation of entire text as it is, I want mainly predictive rules from all ascendents of scorpio, saptarshi Nadi.

Thank you- good luck
