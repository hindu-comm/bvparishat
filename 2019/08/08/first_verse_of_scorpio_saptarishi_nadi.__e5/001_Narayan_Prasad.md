\<\<I'm working on Scorpio Asc,to extract some techniques from that manuscript, I don't want total translation of entire text as it is, I want mainly predictive rules from all ascendents of scorpio, saptarshi Nadi.>\>

  

It may be worthwhile to study what Saptarishi Nadi has to say on the five mahaapurusha yogas. But this will require consideration of other ascendants as well.

Regards. Narayan Prasad.
