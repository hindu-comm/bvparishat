Namaste

  

Need help in finding a correct Dhyana Shloka for the attached Ganapati Murti.

This is not MahaGanapati nor Vallabha Ganapati, as the aayudhas held in each of the hands are different from MahaGanapati and VallabhaGanapati.

  

This ganapati has the following aayudhas & other objects.

  

Right Hand

Chakra, Trishula, Gada, Tusk, Modaka

  

Left Hand

Shanka, Blue closed Lotus, Paddy, Pasha, Holding devi

  

Regards

Bharath Sastry
