Thank you Veera Raghavan ji.

  

The closest is MahaGanapati & VallabhaGanapati too.

I wanted the correct Dhyana Shloka. We asked sculptor do sculpt MahaGanapati, but he ended up making this. So before consecration we need the right dhyana shloka for this ganapati. Hence the request.

  

Regards

Bharath Sastry
