Dear Shri Ajit ji  

  

You may be right in that for a scholar such as yourself or Shri Korada ji it might not mean much, but for a noob like me it is like a treasure.

  

What does a person like me do in archive, who doesnt even know what to search for?

Also the website is rather beautifully arranged and gives off the vibe of being a work of love.
