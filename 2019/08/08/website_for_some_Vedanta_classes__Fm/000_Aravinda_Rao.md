Dear friends,

  

Some of you may be aware that I have been teaching some Vedanta texts on the advaita academy website, which is a part of the Indic Academy. The talks are also uploaded on to the you tube.

A friend of mine, who has also been following the talks, has recently created a website in which all the talks are kept readily available, showing the links to the advaita academy. The website is<https://aravindarao.com/>

I presume that the talks would be useful to students who wish to know some texts along with the bhashyam of Sri Shankaracharya.

Aravinda Rao
