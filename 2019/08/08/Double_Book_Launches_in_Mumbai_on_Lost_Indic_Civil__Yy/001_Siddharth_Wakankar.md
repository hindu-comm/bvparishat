Dear Dr Yogini Madam,

  

Does the book of Shri Bakshi ji refer to the archaeological work done by the late Padmashri Dr. Vishnu Shridhar alias Haribhau Wakankar of Ujjain,whose Centenary is being celebrated by Sanskar Bharati,IGNCA and other academic institutions.

  

Best of luck for the success of the Function.

  

Prof.Siddharth Y Wakankar.
