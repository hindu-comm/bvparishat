Dear friend scholars,

  

When you read Valmiki, the Madhuvana episode in Sundaraknada would

come as an aberration. The vanara group encounters it on their way to

convey Hanuman's message of Sita. The group goes into destructive acts,

which has poetic beauty but might look as a distraction to the story.

In my journey I wrote a short essay the way I interpret Valmiki in the

episode.

Here is the link

I will have a Hindi translation in a few days.

  

Best regards,

BM
