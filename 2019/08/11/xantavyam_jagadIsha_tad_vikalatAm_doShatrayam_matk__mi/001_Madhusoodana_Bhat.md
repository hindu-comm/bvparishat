Respected Scholars,

With my limited knowledge of Samskrit, Malayalam and English, I find the the translation is fairly accurate. My humble attempt would go like this:

\[Oh Lord\], You are formless, yet I meditated upon you imagining a (specific) form;

        You are beyond description, yet I attempted to described you through sthuthis (or praises);

        You are present everywhere, yet I went on pilgrimage;

        Pardon Oh Lord, from these three thoughtless actions of mine.

A search in internet attributed the above shloka to Appayya Deekshit, though not with any certainity.

Bhavdeeya:

Madhusoodana:
