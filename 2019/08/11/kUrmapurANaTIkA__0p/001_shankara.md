Misra ji,  

  

It seems there is no tika available on Kurma Purana.  

  

There is no mention of a tika on Kurma Purana in either NCC vol. 4 or the critical edition of Kurma Purana by Anand Swarup Gupta, published by All India Kashiraj Trust. Gupta provides a long list of published as well as manuscript materials that he had used for preparing the critical edition, in the introductory part of the book.

shankara
