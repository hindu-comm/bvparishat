I think that the paayasa referred to in the context of Putrakameshti brought to and given by the yajnapurusha to Dasharatha made him the questioner believe that it was brought from Devaloka as it was not available in the kitchen of Dasharatha and therefore he concluded that it was not available on earth anywhere before that.

Valmiki also didn't mention at any where else in the poem.

  

The remaining from his guesture.
