Dear Veeraraghavan ji,

  

***“The fact that the poet mentions pAyasa indicates that since the nAma existed the rupa was also in existence.”***

***“It is erroneous to read too much negative detail into a text-based on the absence of information.”***

During the Ramayana period, paayasam existed both in name and form. I never said it didn't exist. I only expressed the feeling that ‘at that time, it was a *Devaloka* dish. Perhaps the normal people of that period do not know how to make it.’ By saying that I am only trying to highlight paayasam as a divine dish as it is not available for ordinary people in *Bhooloka*. I am not trying to read any negative detail based on the absence of information.

I am not even going by ‘अदर्शनं लोपः’ \|

***“**One has to look into ancillary Shastras for that sort of knowledge.**”***

By looking into Ayurveda texts (which were documented after 5^(th) century AD) we cannot decide when Paayasam was first made in *Bhooloka*. We cannot decide whether Mata-Kausalya prepared paayasam and fed Rama or not. We do not even know whether by Sri Krishna’s time paayasam recipe was made public or not.

The ancillary Veda - Ayurveda is not giving the knowledge of whether people of Veda and Purana period ate laddu, sambar, idly, etc. or not. Since we do not have the *pratyaksha pramana* to answer the question posed by Sri Radhakrishna Warrier, I had to use *upamana* or *anumana pramanas*. In this process, I have used the reference to an article in Gita-Darpan.

***“The purpose of the Itihasa Puranas was to elucidate dharma and not to expand on peripheral things which is why you will also find little to no mention of mutra/mala-visarjana, descriptions of maithuNa etc..that does not mean that those people were devoid of human wastes or kAma vṛtti.”***

Why we do not find mention of mutra/mala-visarjana, descriptions of maithuna, etc. in widely in Vedas, Puranas, etc. is well explained in *Kavyaprakasha 7^(th) chapter*:

Use of the words that indicate – व्रीडा, जुगुप्सा, अमङ्गलम् is considered as *kavyadosha*. Hence no wonder they were avoided in Veda and Puranas; and will be avoided while writing *kavya*s as per Mammata’s suggestion.

“रतिहासशोकाद्भुतानि आदिव्योत्तम प्रकृतिवत् दिव्येष्यापि \| किन्तु रतिः संभोगशृङ्गाररूपा उत्तमदेवता विषया न वर्णनीया, तद्वर्णनं हि पित्रोः संभोगवर्णनमिवात्यन्तमनुचितम् \|”

*Lakshana-grantha*s have stipulated certain rules on what Rasas can be described and what should be avoided in what circumstances while writing *kavya*s. These stipulations were made based on the best practices found in the already existing literature.

But to my knowledge, making references to divine food items like paayasam has not been considered as a *dosha* by any of the Kashmiri pandits.

***“This goes back to people suggesting that the Vedics knew no maths because they could not find a derivation of the binomial theorem or the Fibonacci series in the ṛg Veda.”***

In the current discussion, I am only trying to connect some dots (I gave the references in my posts). I am not trying to infer any negative detail. There is no need to link this discussion with issues you had with other people in other contexts.

Regards

P V S Kumar
