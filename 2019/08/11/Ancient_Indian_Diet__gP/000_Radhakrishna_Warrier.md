I was watching this video clip from the Telugu movie Mithunam today:<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDyA1nkpIZ0>

(‡∞Ü‡∞µ‡∞ï‡∞æ‡∞Ø‡∞Æ‡∞®‡∞Ö‡∞Ç‡∞¶‡∞∞‡∞ø‡∞¶‡∞ø ‚Ä¶ƒÅvakƒÅya mana andaridi ‚Ä¶)

‡∞é‡∞Ç‡∞¶‡±Å‡∞ï‡±Å ‡∞™‡∞ø‡∞ú‡±ç‡∞ú‡∞æ ‡∞≤‡±Ü‡∞Ç‡∞¶‡±Å‡∞ï‡±Å ‡∞¨‡∞∞‡±ç‡∞ó‡∞∞‡±ç ‡∞≤‡±Ü‡∞Ç‡∞¶‡±Å‡∞ï‡±Å ‡∞™‡∞æ‡∞∏‡±ç‡∞§‡∞≤‡±Å ‡∞á‡∞Ç‡∞ï‡±Ü‡∞Ç‡∞¶‡±Å‡∞ï‡±Å‡∞≤‡±á ‚Ä¶

Frankly, if there is Indian veggie stuff, I wouldn‚Äôt even look at Pizza, Burger or Pasta. A humble and simple fare of just rice, yogurt, aviyal and achar would be far more welcome for me than all the fancy burgers and pastas of the world. Most Americans, even those who have eaten in Indian restaurants many times, first think of only leaves with some kind of dressing (aka salad) when they hear the word vegetarian. I tell them I hardly eat these uncooked leaves that go by the name salad; my wife cooks plenty of tasty veggie stuff at home, and as they can very well see, I hardly look malnourished or starving. üôÇ

Well, I am digressing. When I saw the video clip, my thoughts went to the diet of ancient Indians. What was their typical diet? India is vast, so there would have been many different diets. Did all this variety of tasty stuff that you see today exist in ancient India? Could the Vedic people have eaten laddoos? Or paayasam? Did the people of Tamil Sangam era eat dosas and iddlies? Could they have taken rice with sambar and aviyal?
