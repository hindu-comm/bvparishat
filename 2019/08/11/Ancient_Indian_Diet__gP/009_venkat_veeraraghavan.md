Dear Shri P V S kumarji,

  

Thank you for your patient write up and the elaborate explanation.

  

I sincerely learnt a lot today.

  

My point is very simple.

It is not possible to use Itihasa puranas to infer much about details pertaining to artha or kama. I assume pAkashastra comes under kAma wrt the 4 purusharthas.

Even though pAyasa is mentioned there is not much information in the text as to recipes and what went on in the kitchen for precisely the reason that Valmiki Ramayana is a Dharma grantha.

I am not suggesting that pAyasa is not delightful here or that it should not find mention in a kavya.

Being an avid connoisseur of pAyasa of all sorts it is not in my nature to disregard pAyasa...:)



There is a story of a man trying to find a lost ring near a street lamp because there was light there, when he had last seen his ring at his house. Although this tale seems rather obvious most of us tend to laugh it off as a fool's tale, many of us myself included are guilty of such fallacious thinking.



This is very similar in nature to people trying to find evidence of math rigour within the vedas. The analogy is not very far off to be honest.

I was not in any manner trying to connect you with that thread, but the fallacy was too similar in nature to go unremarked.  

Ayurveda and its texts while they give many recipes for remedying kashayas, lehyas etc they do not expand much on actual day to day food. There are certain special prayogas given like the amalaki -Savitri but they are just that a special application.

  

Thank you once again for your patient writeup.

  

Your reply is a testament to a firm belief of mine, that if one must choose adversaries one must choose the learned, for even in defeat there is victory..:)

  

Kind Regards,

  

Venkat
