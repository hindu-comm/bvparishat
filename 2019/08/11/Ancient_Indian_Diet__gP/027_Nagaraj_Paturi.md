The word vaDa which is now part of words like meduvaDa, vaDapav etc. seems to be from the Tamil vaDa =north.

In anciant Tamil Telugus were referred to as VaDagar =northern people. In Telugu, the word for this item is gaari/gaare. In Tamil, probably this Telugus item was called vaDa = the northern (Telugu) item. Just a guess. I could be wrong.
