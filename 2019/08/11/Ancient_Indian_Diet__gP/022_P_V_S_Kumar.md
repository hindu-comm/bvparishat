Based on further search in Ramayana using Ramayana Concordance, [*https://archive.org/details/ThePadaIndexOfValmikiRamayanaVol2_201807/page/n479*](https://archive.org/details/ThePadaIndexOfValmikiRamayanaVol2_201807/page/n479)I found couple more references to paayasam in Ramayana. As mentioned by Sri Nagaraj Paturi, the reference to paayasam in Balakanda is to paayasam made in Devaloka, whilst references in Ayodhyakanda were to paayasam made in Bhooloka. To bring out this difference only, Valmiki used ‘इदं तु’ in 1-16-19!

Thus, to arrive at a better answer to Sri Radhakrishna Warrier’s original question, one need to meticulously search for names of food items in the books like A Vedic Word Concordance, Concordance of Purana Content, A Concordance to the Principal Upanishads and Bhagavad-Gita (theseare available in [archive.org](http://archive.org)) and other shastras, literature and history books.

Some of the prominent roles in Ramayana, Mahabharata, … refer to a communities that hunt birds, animals and fish for food. (Nishadha, Kirata and Satyavati, are some representative roles). So, while doing the word search non-vegetarian aspect also need to be kept in mind.

As a scholar of this group shared with me through a private message, a respectable search for food items had been done on Bible and the list has been presented here [*https://www.learnreligions.com/foods-of-the-bible-700172*](https://www.learnreligions.com/foods-of-the-bible-700172) Except for bread and cake, all other items in that list seem to be only single ingredient foods. That indicates, cooking was not a well developed art even by Old Testament time in 'that' geography!
