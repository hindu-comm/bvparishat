Dear Shri Venkat Ji,

  

  Sorry, I assumed that most of our members will understand the verse in Sanskrit. Here is the verse with my English translation:

  

जग्ध्वा चक्रसमानमाषवटकान् आध्मायमानोदरे

  फट्-फट्-फाडिति पायवीयपवनान् योगीश्वरे मुञ्चति ।

उड्डीनं विहगैर्घटैर्विदलितं चान्दोलितं भित्तिभि:

  शिष्यैर्धावितमर्भकैर्निपतितं कोलाहलोऽभून्मठे ।।

"When the great Yogi had bloated stomach after eating the Vaṭakas of Urad \[māṣa\] as large as wheels and when he released his intestinal gasses making laud noises 'phat-phat-phat,' the birds flew up, clay jars split apart, the walls shook up, the disciples ran around, the children fell down, and there was a big tumult in the mutt."

  

Now you know the comedy.
