Dear Shri PVS Kumar:  

  

The purpose of the Itihasa Puranas was to elucidate dharma and not to expand on peripheral things which is why you will also find little to no mention of mutra/mala-visarjana, descriptions of maithuNa etc..that does not mean that those people were devoid of human wastes or kAma vṛtti.

  

Thanks in no small part to considerate "liberal" film makers, I think audience expectation on 360 degree cinema has started extending to shastra as well.

  

You will also not find extensive descriptions of artha except how it was used in the context of dharma.

One has to look into ancillary shastras for that sort of knowledge.

  

The fact that the poet mentions pAyasa indicates that since the nAma existed the rupa was also in existence. Otherwise I am sure the description would have been different...as kinchit homa/yajna-prasada..etc.

  

It is erroneous to read too much negative detail into a text based on absence of information.

This goes back to people suggesting that the Vedics knew no maths because they could not find a derivation of the binomial theorem or the fibonacci series in the ṛg veda.

  

Thanks for the story behind the famous Laddu of Tirupati..:)

  

Kind Regards,

  

Venkat
