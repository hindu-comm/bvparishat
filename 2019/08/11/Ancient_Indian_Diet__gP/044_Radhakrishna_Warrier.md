Thank you all for your postings that made this thread quite interesting and informative.

While on the subject of food, would like to discuss cooking oil of ancient times.

The word for oil in all Indian languages is derived from sesame.
Sanskrit word for oil is ‘taila’ (तैल) which is from ‘tila’ meaning sesame. The modern Indo-Aryan word for oil is ‘tel’ (तेल) which is a cognate of Sanskrit ‘taila’. The word for oil in Malayalam, eṇṇa, in Tamil eṇṇey, and in Kannada eṇṇe; are all derived from eḷ + ney = ‘sesame fat’. Telugu nūne is from nuvvula meaning sesame. So, the very first oil used in India must have been sesame oil. All other oils must have come later. In Malayalam sesame oil is called nalleṇṇa = nalla + eṇṇa meaning ‘good oil’, although Malayalis now predominantly use coconut oil for cooking.

Interestingly, in most European languages including ancient Latin and modern Italian, French, Portuguese, German and English, the word for oil is ultimately derived from olive. So, the first oil the Europeans used must have been olive oil; use of all other oils must have come later.

Regards,

Radhakrishna Warrier
