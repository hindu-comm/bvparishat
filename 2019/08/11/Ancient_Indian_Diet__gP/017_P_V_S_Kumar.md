There is no need of any guess work to tell that paayasam was originallya product of Devaloka. Here is the line from Ramayana Balakanda ***…***

*******इदं तु नृपशार्दूल* ***पायसं देवनिर्मितम्***। प्रजाकरं गृहाण त्वं धन्यमारोग्यवर्धनम्।।1.16.19।।******

  

Devaloka has Kamadhenu, Kalpa-vriksha, Akshaya-paatra, and what not? So, for them, it is just like pressing a button on the vending machine. Product of their wish will appear in front of them immediately. No need of cultivation in Devaloka. We all should visit that place one day! :-)

  

We, the people on theearth depend on Amazon likeonline portals for getting products of our wish.During Putrakameshti, Yajnapurusha represented 'Zomato' of our days for delivering the paayasam from Devaloka. All this has been beautifully described by Valmiki in 16th Sarga of Balakanda.
