Dear Venkat ji,

  

Your assumption that Pakashastra comes under Kama seems to hold some water because,the Vibhaavareevilaasa,the third Khanda or part of the Bhojanakutuhalam,which is still in the form of an unpublished ms.,is devoted almost to the description of Erotics only in the sense that it describes different flowers and couches etc.which need to be used by the Rasika to enjoy his night sports etc. The description is very minute and graphic and touches do many minor points which matter more for him and her. It is an interesting and enjoyable reading.
