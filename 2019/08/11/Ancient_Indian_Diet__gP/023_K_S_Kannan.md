In bhAsa's plays, we get non-veg items from specific animals

\- commended for *s'rAddha*. (Ref. the play *pratimA*).

That *pitR*-s would be pleased with such offerings is recorded elsewhere also.

  

In much later works like *ks"ema-kutUhala* and *bhojana-kutUhala,*

there are more non-veg recipes than purely veg ones.
