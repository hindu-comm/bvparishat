Not sure whether queens of Dasaratha or their cooks know the recipe for making paayasam, but sure there was a facility of door delivering ready to eat *paayasa*m on special arrangement (that requires presence of highly sophisticated people like Rushyasringa, etc.) during Ramayana period: see Bala Kanda, Chapter 16, Verse 27 to 29.

Not sure when humans got the recipe and started making paayasam themselves.

In Bhagavatam Canto 10, Chapter 81 there is a reference of Sudhama sharing hand pound rice flakes with Sri Krishna. Poha is common across India even today.

Perhaps only heating, roasting, grinding, pounding are the only ways of processing food in those days. We can find references to instruments required for these processes in literature related to ancient times. Baking, steaming, boiling, frying, etc. (which are used in preparing pizza, burger, pasta, idly, sambar, etc.) are relatively modern methods of making food.

In this context, you may like to know some information about the famous Tirupati Balaji laddu from here [*https://www.indiadivine.org/story-behind-tirumala-srivari-laddu/*](https://www.indiadivine.org/story-behind-tirumala-srivari-laddu/) .
