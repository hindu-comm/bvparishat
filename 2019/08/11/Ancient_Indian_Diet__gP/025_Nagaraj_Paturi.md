From the Hindu article:

  

*Pakadarpana of Nala*is a book by Madhulika, edited by Jay Ram Yadav and brought out by Chaukhambha Orientalia Varanasi. It is a translation of the*Pakadarpana*procured from the Sarasvati Bhavan Library of Sampurnanand Sanskrit University in Varanasi. It has 24 folios. The Sanskrit*shloka*with its translation in English. In the chapter on ‘Payasa’ — with recipes for preparation of garlic*payasa*and wheat*payasa*, there is also a process for preparation of syrups from fruits and flowers. It is an interesting book which works as a guide to cooking, trying recipes and experimentation. One needs to decipher and read into the mind of a cook to understand how these recipes work.

INTACH’s*The Soopa Shastra of Mangarasa III – Culinary Traditions of Medieval Karnataka*(edited in Kannada by SN Krishna Jois), edited by NP Bhat and Nerupama Y Modwel, brings out the fineness of vegetarian cooking between the 15th and 16th centuries.
