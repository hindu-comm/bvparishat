Dear Shri Madhav ji--  

  

I was reminded of my own school days where a friend of mine was whispering something funny in my ear (in the last bench)..our computer science teacher Mr. Ramamurthy called his name out and made him stand up.

He began in a serious tone--> "This is highly unfair on your part..I am trying to teach here and you are telling jokes to your friend in the last bench.."..My friend and the rest of the class were tensing up for the inevitable detention/punishment instead came the Coup de grâce "you are sharing funny stories privately in the last bench..what about the rest of us?"

  

May it please you to explain the meaning of the comic verse?

  

Kind Regards,

  

Venkat
