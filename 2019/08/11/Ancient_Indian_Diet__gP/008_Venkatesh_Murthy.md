Namaste

  

In 4th Anuvaka Chamaka Prashna of Yajur Veda there is a list of food grains. All those grains were available in ancient India. If they were available the dishes prepared using those food grains were also available. People were eating those dishes prepared from the food grains. One more information source is grains used in Yajnas.

  

I heard that Groundnut is a foreign food recently introduced in India. It was not there a few centuries back.
