Dear Sir,

  

Though we get references to different dishes in Sanskrit literature,actual Ayurvedic books on Dietetics etc.seem to have come into existence in the last 5/6 centuries. The well.known books like Bhojanakutuhalam of Raghunath Ganesh Navahasta,modern Maharashtrian surname Nawathe,protege of the Tanjore Maharaja, was very popular.There are other books also and many unpublished manuscripts dealing with this interesting and fascinating topic.

  

Hope,they will satiate you.

  

Best of luck.  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
