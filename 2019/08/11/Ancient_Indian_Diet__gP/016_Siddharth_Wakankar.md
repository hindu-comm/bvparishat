In the Satsangi Jeevan book of the Swaminarayan Sect,there are recipes of good Gujarati food.varieties.Somebody has to work on it.

  

In 1984-85,I presented a paper on Pakashastra MSS.in the Oriental Institute,Baroda,reading which the world famous chef,Shri Sanjeev Kapoor, came from Bombay to meet me in Baroda. As a result of the study of this treasure,he writes his books in Marathi and English and are published by Shri Ramdas Bhatkal of Popular Prakashan, Mumbai.

  

Some studies are done on some of the aspects of Ancient Indian Dietetics as mentioned by Dr.Irene.

  

Unfortunately,most of the Home Science Faculty,esp.of Food and Nutrition Dept.and their students are abysmally innocent of the rich and varied treasure of our Food and Table Manners.

  

Without mentioning the name of that scholar who met me in Bangalore, I may say that a person who was appointed - after his retirement- the Principal of the Ayurvedic College founded by a Modern Swami,had never heard the name of Bhojanakutuhalam, a very important and novel book by Raghunath Ganesh Navathe of Tanjore Court.

  

Let us hope,that day dawns when Sanskrit scholars in collaboration with Ayurvedic scholars take up some project on this line and unearth gems.

  

Best of luck to such enthusiastic scholars.
