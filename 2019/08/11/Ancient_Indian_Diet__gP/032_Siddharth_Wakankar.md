Dear Madhavbhau,

  

Since the time of the great Sayajirao Gaekwad III, there was a very interesting exam in Vadodara,in Sanskrit Shastras,Ayurveda etc. known as Dakshinaa Pariksha which used to be very tough,as compared to the modern exams in Sanskrit Mahavidyalayas,[esp.in](http://esp.in) Vadodara.

  

I don't know whether that [exam.is](http://exam.is) still conducted or not.

  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
