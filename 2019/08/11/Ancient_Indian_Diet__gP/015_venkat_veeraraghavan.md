Dear Shri Siddharth ji:  

  

There are several aspects to consider here.

AhAra may be considered a part of sharira dharma but the science behind recipes and the sheer शुश्रूष that goes into the preparation, cooking and bringing together of ingredients in cuisine tends to push pAkashastra firmly in the tent of kAma.

  

The other aspect to consider is this:

The dharma shastras suggest that mass psyche has shifted firmly from dharma to kAma and artha in kaliyuga.

It is possible that the reduction in importance of one aspect has resulted in an excess of importance being given to kAma and it's constituents. It is possible that recipes have become more involved and intricate in kaliyuga.

Given the famed oral tradition it is possible that recipes were handed over within families and were rarely recorded like Escoffier's magnum opus.

If at all, there are likely to be more treatises on the same in recent centuries than in bygone yugas.

Manuscripts if any of royal recipes are likely to have been preserved within the lineages of kings.

Maybe some are left waiting to be digitised in some dusty hall of Sarasvati mahal Library or some such place just waiting for their time in the sun.

Bhima has often been touted as the inventor of "Aviyal" in urban legend.

However without real sources it will remain just that.

I remember reading somewhere detailed descriptions of food items in the Mahabharata in the section where the Yadavas desport themselves near the sea after their worship at Prabhasa and just before their destruction.

It could have been in the Harivamsha(?)

However again there are no recipes given..

  

Kind Regards,

  

Venkat
