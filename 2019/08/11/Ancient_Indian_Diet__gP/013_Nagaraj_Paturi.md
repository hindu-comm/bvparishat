1\. Sanskrit words such as apūpa, sūpa etc. refer to dishes. A compilation of all such words can help.

  

2\. Many names of traditional Indian regional and /or pan- Indian dishes have Sanskrit words in them. pāyasam, paramānnam, rasam, bhakṣyam, pūr̥ṇa \> pūraṇ etc. Working on the origin of such words may be helpful.

  

3\. The famous story of mōdakaistāḍaya has the word mōdaka in it.

  

4\. vidūṣaka in Sanskrit plays is shown as a foody. There are food items discussed there.

  

5\. Works like kāśī khaṇḍam have list of food items served as offerings ,

  

5\. If the interest is in ancient Indian diet not limited to that reflected in Sanskrit literature, oral and written literature in regional Indian languages has rich reflection/documentation of such information.  

  

6\. I grew up hearing very long lists of traditional food items in Kannada in the Kannada vrata kathe songs such as s'rāvaṇa s'ukravārada hāḍu, s'rāvaṇa mangala vārada hāḍu, gaurīdēviya habbada hāḍu etc.

  

7\. The present names of the present traditional Indian food items can be expected to be very ancient in origin and their history can be theorized or traced.

  

8\. Since this is such an imaginable topic, I expect that already some research works must have come out on this.
