An exhaustive history book on food!  

  

It is interesting to read that ...



"The earliest reference to something of a precursor to Idli occurs in the Kannada writing of Sivakotyacharya in 920 AD. \[this work mentions 'iddalige', which may be the origin of *idli*; but this was **made from urad dhal batter only**.\]"(no rice, no fermentation!)



It was again in **Karnataka** that MTR (Mavalli Tiffin Room) has invented another famousidli recipe. This time,**no urad dhal at all. No rice too.** It is- Rava Idli. Indeed afascinating invention during second world war II. ****
