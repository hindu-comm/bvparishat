How can one decide that payasam belongs to devaloka? Was it rice payasam or wheat payasam? Whatever it was, who would indulge in cultivation in devaloka when they don’t eat any food, they being amritasanas and don’t have hunger etc.? In Mahabharata Ashwins offer apupam to Upamanyu. Shall we consider it also as a devaloka dish?
