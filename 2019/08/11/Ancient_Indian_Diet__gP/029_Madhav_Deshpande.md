Dear Siddhartha Ji,

  

  Your comment that Gujaratis call Marathis Dakshini is interesting.
The first time I was called a Dakshini scholar was during one of my visits to Banaras. In Maharashtra of Shivasena, Dakshin begins to the south of Maharashtra. The word Deccan in the name of Deccan College in Pune was used by the British to refer to Pune as part of the Deccan, and so we have the famous train, the Deccan Queen, running between Pune and Mumbai. However, evidently the Marathi name for Deccan College was दक्षिणा महाविद्यालय, because the British used the दक्षिणा fund used annually by the Peshwas for this educational purpose, after the takeover of Pune in 1818. So, in this case, there is an interesting confusion between the words दक्षिण and दक्षिणा.
