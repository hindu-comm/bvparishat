A friend sent me this message:

  

It is unbelievable that in the era of globalization the affection towards sanskrit stays alive . A Sanskrit scholar namely मारेल्ल कीर्तिचन्द्र who is a disciple of late . उपद्रष्ट वेंकट कृष्णय्य ji of Vijayawada has initiated classes of अमरकोशः - गुरुबाल प्रबोधिका टीका सहितम्- A sloka per day programme on whatsapp . Due to the interest of candidates its developed for second group. And later due to the interest from Tamizh and kannada people his अमरकोशः classes are translated into Tamiz and Kannada . For that other groups are created for Kannada and Tamizh. Nearly 500 people are listening the Amarakosa by his efforts.
It's very proud to say that he followed the lineage of his guru who was a committed sanskrit teacher and taught several students for 60 years without taking a rupee. Mr. Keerti chandra is basically a qualified Cost Accountant and his scholarship in Sanskrit is also very good. It's happy to inform that he reached another milestone by having his Amarakosa classes in website too. Wish that all the Sanskrit scholars and people welcome his efforts and pass this website details to the students who are interested to learn Amarakosa.

  

The website link is as follows <https://sanskrit.today/amarakosha/>  
Thank you.  

  

warm regards
