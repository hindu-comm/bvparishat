The article is one sided and seems to be written by a half baked Sanskrit scholar and seems to be a Panditammanya and considers himself/ herself to be competent enough to make such statements without giving due respect to the worthy exceptions and has a penchant for sweeping statements.

  

Must be a paid or patronised and biased scholar. His/ her statements seem to be too much stretched to extremes.

  

Others have already pointed out his other mistakes.Less said is better,more said us worst.
