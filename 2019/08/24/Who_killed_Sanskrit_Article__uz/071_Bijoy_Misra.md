Dear Kananji,

The note seems to have a jab at people who profess science.

I am of the opinion the Indian philosophy and language are founded

upon basic natural science without any assumption or extrapolation.

It is our challenge to check how observations were recorded to

create profound observations. Yes I do differ from the Indology

hypothesis that materials were thrown through intuition.

There would many millennia of history for each statement that  

looks casual these days to the "readers".

This is an opinion.

Best regards,

BM
