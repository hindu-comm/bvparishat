\*Society has always been full of inertia\*

Yes, an important realisation, and a worthy note of caution to both types of people:

\- to those who are overenthusiastic - not to expect results too fast;

\- to those who are pessimistic - not to continue to be complacent.  

Each of us must aspire and strive towards a higher goal

\- individually as well as collectively.
