Dear Vidwans,

  

However much distasteful the article is, scholars on this list must admit that students at the entry level i.e. in 6th or 8th are not initiated properly as none of the vernacular languages support Sanskrit speech ab initio.

  

The condition of Sanskrit Shiksha is in a very bad state. Those who claim to know the Shiksha just parrot it in schools and colleges. I doubt whether the teaching staff in schools are properly trained to teach Sanskrit with all its nuances. Moresoever there aren't any good books with exhaustive examples on vernacular grammar. How can one teach Sanskrit, which by no means is a spoken language in India, without the child/student knowing the grammar of his own tongue. Why do Sanskrit Scholars not invest their energies in writing good books on vernacular grammar with exhaustive examples like Wren and Martin English Grammar rather than discussing Sanskrit grammar.

  

Sanskrit Scholars in the country need to look into themselves rather than blame the upcoming generations for the sorry state of affairs or for that matter people criticizing the sorry state of affairs at home.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
