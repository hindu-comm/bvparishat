Teaching Sanskrit for the sake of nurturing but a few practical skills in a child is to tremendously trivialise it,

making it subserve mere mundane ends and no more.

A vast horizon of a long heritage conducing to elevation and ennoblement as would endure all life and beyond  

can verily open up before the child - if shown the right direction.

  

Or else, the child can tread the path of many Western Indologists,

who, for all their scholarship, like the industrious lowly leech  

would seek but to suck the blood of even a kAmadhenu,

rather than milk the *purus"Artha*-s that she would benignly offer.

  

There can be "scientists" too who may gloat over their discovery  

that the diamond is nothing but (an allotrope of) carbon, and rest content, *punkt*.

  

The old maxim says  

***kAcam anvis"yato maNir labdhA!***

But there can be some who would

***s'ramitvA labdhvApi*** ***maNim* *kAcanirvis'es"am eva* *tAm upayun"jAnAs tRpyanti *dRpyanti ca*!!***

*  
*

God save such creatures!*  
*

(Caveat: I am not of course speaking of the elevated beings who can be as *  
*

***sama-los"TAs'ma-kAn"canaH**).*
