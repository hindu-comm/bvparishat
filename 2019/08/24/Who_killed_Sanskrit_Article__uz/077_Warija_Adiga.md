Namaste,

While I have not gone through each reply or discussion on this article, as a student of Sanskrit, I have posted the following comment on the article -

  

"This is a very exaggerated statement that "no-one" studies Sanskrit in India and Western scholars know better than the Indian scholars. I have attended a few conferences, and am amazed at the erudition of Sanskrit scholars, and I watch their lectures on you-tube too. I was an ignoramus on Sanskrit a couple of years back, but have now started learning Sanskrit and getting deeper onto to it. It is the power of Sanskrit, it just attracts you and does not require any marketing. The power within it is so strong, once you learn the language and started reading its literature, it creates a new world for you.

I got into learning Sanskrit a couple of years back, and found it so powerful and my library is getting filled with Sanskrit books, which have created a wonderful world of wisdom for me. Please look into the work of Sanskrit Bharati, a slow revolution is happening, many are learning Sanskrit. Quite a few of my neighbors started learning Sanskrit, when they realized the richness its literature was bringing into their lives, and it was not as difficult to learn for Indians, as people think it to be.

For bashing Indian scholars, praising Western ones, I have this quote from Sanskrit -

त्वां स रक्षतियत्नेन, मां स द्वेष्टि निरन्तरम्।

तवैव दोषो नैवात्र मम दोषोऽस्ति कश्चन।।

"

Thestate of affairs on Sanskrit education that the author alludes to, is valid for any subject that is being taught in our schools and colleges, as "obtainingmarks" as against "obtaining knowledge" or "building employability" has become the trend in the modern education system, where it is quantity and not quality that matters. So, it is unfair to target Sanskrit alone.

  

Respectfully,

Warija Adiga
