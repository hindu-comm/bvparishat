Namaste Deva Pattanayak



1. You have a good point in making a call for \< UGC may require that
**students pass a test in Sanskrit** before obtaining  Ph.D. in Philosophy, Literature, history, sociology, politics ! science, economics and other humanity subjects that will benefit from the vast knowledge stored in ancient Sanskrit tests, like Vedas etc. \>



Such provisions do exist already ; but the implementation is slack !



2. On the call for \* Sanskrit studies at high school level be offered as an optional subject \* the provisions already exists. The implementation is slack. The teachers and text book providers have found a via-media working solution! The design of contents in the
text are made 60% for A learners, 20% for B-level learners and 15% for A-level learners and 5% for A+ level learners. The teachers meet the \***Exam level needs for marks**\* in (60+20+15) segments. The general stand hold good that intelligent students who are good in maths are also good in sanskrit/ vice-versa. Sanskrit is like maths for scoring. This is not a test of language skill or proficiency .



3. On the expectations \< Let efforts be made to simplify Sanskrit. To start with let go of Sandhi, the process of combining words according to strict rules. It adds to style and its elitism but adds little to substance while making it difficult to understand. Yes to the need for Sanskrit scholars and others to be knowledgeable in other old languages
like Latin,Greek, Arabic etc, Important to realize that there are many full fledged languages in India with mass following. There is no state in Bharat where people’s mother tongue is Sanskrit. Languages like Tamil, Telugu, Hindi, Odia and others like Bengali have rich literature and social influence over millions of people through music, drama, dance and festivities. The deva bhasha Sanskrit will take decades from now to become a manab bhasha in Bharat. \>



 There are many connected issues that need to be contemplated here.
This kind of experiment has been carried in reputed universities
beyond India in the colonial frame of Sanskrit studies for over three centuries. This model has violated and vitiated the paninian pedagogy of Samskruth studies, the foundation to understand ' bharateeyataa in rest of Indian languages like Tamil, Telugu, Hindi, Odia , Bengali, Kashmiri etc; and art-forms-humanities and yoga in music, drama, dance and festivities.



 The challenge of current period is finding a working fitment for 21st century Samskruth studies at school level, between the pedagogy options of 'anglicized Sanskrit colonial model' and 'Desi -Prakruth model of language through language'. The modus operandi will be defined by clarity of goals and tools used for education. And all this depends upon the ' people-investment in Samskruth Education transitions through this turbulence'. 



Are there deep pockets which are ready to stake their good dollar in this ? in a 'self-less way' ?? CSR, NGO , Non-Profit are all nice tags for money movement with deep strings controlling fingers of investors.
