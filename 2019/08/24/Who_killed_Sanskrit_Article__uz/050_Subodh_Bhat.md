Any language can be said to be dead only if nobody converse in the language, nobody studies the language, no literary works produced in the language, no books are available in the language and no research and academic works are carried in the language. Sanskrit fails in all these tests and hence is not dead. In fact going by the keen interest it generates not only in India but world wide, one could argue its very much live and ticking! So when its not dead, the question 'Who killed Sanskrit?' simply does not arise. So I have not bothered to read the article, which may be somebody's fantasy!
