Namaste



On \<Venkatesh Murthy: At five universities in India, Sanskrit is officially taught in Hindi or other vernaculars, not in Sanskrit! Can there be a bigger irony than this?''>



There is a far greater irony ! and ' scholarly insomnia on Paninian Pedagogy of Samskrutham' and ' Prakruth ( mother of Hindi and Desi)
Languages of India. This is a clear fall out of lack of clarity on ' Samskruth-Prakruth Relations' from a Native Indian Perspective and embracing the colonial axioms anchored to the 'Tower of Babel' Language streams explaining IE linguistics.



I am pointing to the post 1990 Indian language teaching models and grant supported projects, movements in 'Non-Sanskrit segment' initiated at
some ( reputed - ? ) indological research institutes. The axiom of research seems to be drawn from colonial linguistic model for indology study runs:

' **Prakruth is to be taught in Prakruth only. **

**' Prakrtuh studies need to be sanitized from the classical language grammars which link various Prakruth's from 'Bhashaa' of Paninian Samskruth'. **

****

**The goal: The new linguistic Prakruth derivations need to be used to understand- interpret- translate ancient works of Hinduism in Non-Sanskrit languages to create social connection of religion scriptures through ' regional language translations' to replicate the 'model of Old Testament to Bible to New Bible translations' to spread the message of God/s . The model of 'Non-Sanskrit covers Tamil/ Kannada / Dravidam, ardhamagadhi, avadhi, goorjari, Maharashtrian et al.)**

  
  
Whether this initiative will gain momentum and impact society, or not,
the trends are already going on. Only TIME can answer what comes out of such initiatives and views and 2050 indian language pedagogy and teaching policies ! .

Can some member from Pune verify whether his claim to have taught at BORI



\["...While teaching Persian and Sanskrit at the world-renowned Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, Pune,..."\]



is trueor just another guffaw like Dandi's Urubhangam! Kuempu's love for Sanskrit is as far as I know a false claim.

Professors of Sanskrit at Indian universities are just whiling away their time while getting hefty salaries. They themselves can't speak or write correct Sanskrit. Their written and colloquial Sanskrit is not just stale, it's wanting on all counts.At five universities in India, Sanskrit is officially taught in Hindi or other vernaculars, not in Sanskrit!
