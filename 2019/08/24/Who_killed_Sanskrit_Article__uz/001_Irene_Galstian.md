Yes, the problem of Sanskrit teaching exists, and yes, the difficulty  
is compounded by the fact that India is a very large country. But  
indiscriminately criticising Indian Sanskritists is a false and  
misleading move. And presenting the situation at non-Indian  
universities as flawless is dishonest. Other than unnecessarily  
offending sincere and hardworking educators, I don't see what this  
approach can accomplish. A deeply unfair article.
