Don't discard science, discard pseudo-science.

Most material touted as Indology is pseudo-science, no analysis, all correlation.

The British encouraged copying. Many new "scholars" deliberately copy.  

Some copy to keep their job, both east and west.

India will rise when a scholar only expresses after he/she has something useful and creative to say..
