During my long association with BORI I never met this scholar even during my tenure as the hon. Secretary of BORI nor do I remembered any courses conducted by him at BORI. Could this be another BORI like Dandi' ऊरुभङ्गम्?

,I do agree with his observation about Sanskrit teachers.I am making my small contribution by motivating Sanskrit students to attend and participate in वाक्यार्थसभाs which has become, more or less ,a regular feature in Pune though on a small scale.

थसभा
