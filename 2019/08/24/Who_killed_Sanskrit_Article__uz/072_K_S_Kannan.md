No jab meant, sir, at science or scientists.

  

Many times, the pursuit of science becomes an end in itself.

Science can get directionless too, and can arrogate to itself  

what is outside its ken or purview at a given point of time.

Instances are not rare when scientists have pooh-poohed yesterday  

what they accept as normal today. At the hands of the mediocre, things pass for

being scientific while all they have is but a semblance and bombast of  

scientific appurtenances and procedures.

  

I had read a long time ago a scientific pronouncement that  

all that the human body contains is worth a mere ten dollars

\- in terms of its chemical contents. Nothing could be more true,  

or more trivial at the same time nevertheless!

  

Please look into what is marked as the infamous "19th Century arrogance of scientists"  

in the history of science. Alongside, Michael Polanyi's writings could be veritable eye-openers.

  

True scientists, quite unlike our Indologists ( a good many of them at least)

would not be highly opinionated, or start with a load of presuppositions, prejudices and propagandism.

History has become so agenda-driven that it has veritably been reduced to a bastard discipline.

"History is hard-core interpretation surrounded by a pulp of disputable facts"

as they say.

  

All this is not meant to deride or declaim the value of true science or true history.
