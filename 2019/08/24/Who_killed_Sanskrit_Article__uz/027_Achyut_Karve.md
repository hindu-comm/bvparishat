Dear Vidwans,

  

Let us remember that 'Mass Education' is practiced in India where the strength of a class is 50 students to a 100 right from 1st Std. In such a situation unless the primary teacher is well trained to teach a language with all its nuances to a crowd of 50 to 100 how can one expect a student to be well versed in any subject. It is at the primary level that the problem lies.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
