Namaste,

  

Without actually commenting on the article and its content, I'd like to list an observation of mine. While teaching Laghusiddhantakaumudi to some students, I found out that even the Kovida level study that they undergone, which is supposed to be a 4th level,has been from \*exam point of view\*! This is the basic flaw that I find in all kind of studies, be it Sanskrit, engineering when I studied it or math as Prof. Yoganandaji mentioned in this thread. The commitment to study is lacking and so is the teaching tuned to exams, solving old papers and everything is centred around scoring; thats about it! How much one really learns as to the core of any subject seems to be nobody's business.

  

IMO, we have, somewhere around the journey to modern success, lost the gurukula mode, wherein exams are meant only to test the knowledge and not how much one can quote shabdataH from books or apply formulae without application, as the case may be.

  

Kind rgds,
