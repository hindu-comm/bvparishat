I subscribe to the hypothesis that having a sustained (over fairly long periods of time, say at least decades) stream of high-quality scholarship, in the post-industrial revolution world at least, is ALSO (and not ONLY) a function of resource allocation and its efficient deployment. I would be intrigued if my original statement allowed an interpretation that I had implied merely resources alone sufficient in generating an appreciable quantity of high-quality scholarship. I do not at all disagree on the need for "a certain elevation of the mind" but optimal resource allocation and"a certain elevation of the mind" might be a better bet than only"a certain elevation of the mind".
