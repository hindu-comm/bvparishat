I agree with Prof Iyenger, that the article has some truth.

  

What I hope Sanskrit scholars will take away message is to try and acknowledge the reality at present., because you cannot change what you cannot and will not acknowledge.  

  

There have be many posts from aspiring Sanskrit students enqueuing, what type of research dissertation they should do for their Ph.D. ? I would like them to reflect on why so many R^igvedic shaakhaa's have been lost and why ?

  

I recall Prof Korada mentioning that there are no quality students in Sanskrit ?

  

As I have mentioned on this list in past quoting famous words from Late US justice Warren burger, *" If you ask the question who is responsible, answer must always be, I am, You are & we are."*  

  

Things can only be improved if we have a desire to do so. कामस्तदग्रे समवर्तताधि मनसो रेतः परथमं यदासीत \|\| 10.129 \|\|  

  

Hope for the best with fingers crossed,  

  

Dr Yadu
