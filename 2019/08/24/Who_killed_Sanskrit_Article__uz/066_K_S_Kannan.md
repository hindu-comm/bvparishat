Dear Dr. Raghavender Upadhyayula,

  

As an alumnus of IISc, you may surely get to know more easily than others

how efforts are on to draw students towards pure science.

  

Apparently, research is at a low ebb in our country.

The Central Government has come up with schemes encouraging research,

starting with upscaling the stipend of research scholars fairly drastically.

Yet not all of the offers were taken up, and it appears grants are lapsing!

  

These (busy) bees go where there is *more* h(m)oney!

Before lucre, all else is lack lustre!

As the old saying goes:

धनैर् निष्कुलीनाः कुलीना भवन्ति,

 धनैर् आपदं मानवा निस्तरन्ति, !।

धनेभ्यस् समो नास्ति बन्धुर् हि लोके -  

 ***धनान्यार्जयध्वं धनान्यार्जयध्वम्* !!**॥

I appreciate your worry and concern.

Regards
