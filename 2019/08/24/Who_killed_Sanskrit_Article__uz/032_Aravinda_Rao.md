Dear friends,

This has been a rather uncomfortable discussion. I am not from the Sanskrit academic stream, but as an outsider I have been associated with Sanskrit studies for about 25 years. I have been noticing some of the inadequacies of the present day scholars.

About 15-20 years ago, I met several चतुश्शास्त्र पण्डित-s, those who were well versed in Vyakarana, Vedanta, Mimamsa and Nyaya. They knew several texts by heart and were able to teach without the help of a text. In addition they were also well versed in Sahitya. This tribe has drastically dwindled now. The scholars who are products of the University stream are not a match for the older scholars.

More important than this is that the Western Sanskritists have a wider grounding in languages such as Greek, Latin etc., in addition to Sanskrit. Several years ago, George Cardona, the well known grammarian, spoke in the Osmania University, Hyderabad, making observations on Linguistics in Greek and Latin, in addition to Sanskrit. Our scholars were mere audience. The present bête noir, Sheldon Pollock is well versed in the classical languages of the West in addition to Sanskrit. He seems to have held a discussion with the Sringeri Acharya in Sanskrit. I read a book, ‘Empires of the Word – A Language History of the World’ by a British scholar, Nicholas Ostler, who according to his introduction, knew about 20 languages, besides having a Ph.D. in 6 languages such as Greek, Latin and Sanskrit.

For the past many years I have been appealing to the young Sanskrit scholars that they should pursue studies in Greek, Latin, Hebrew, Persian etc., in order to authoritatively talk on what the Western Indologists are writing. Just as several Western scholars have an intimate knowledge of the Sanskrit tradition, the Indian scholars too should aim at knowledge of other traditions from the original sources. My apologies to scholars like Vishwa Adluri, Bagchi and some others of this group who may be some noble exceptions. The Indian *vaada* tradition shows that all our old acharya-s knew the पूर्वपक्ष thoroughly while having debates on a subject. Glorious examples such as Kumarila bhatta, Shankara, Ramanuja and many others come to our mind. I recall a line from one text book in Linguistics, which says, ‘what does he know of English who only English knows?’ This applies to all languages and traditions.

I believe that the Western scholars will continue to write our narrative which may seem more credible and authoritative. The Indian scholars should be able to speak to them at the same level of scholarship.
