Namaste Irene

 (***Note:*** please read Samskrutham for a second reading in the place of juice and traditional scholar for gardener)

  

1. The 'Juice extractor, seller and drinker as beneficiaries' have a collective responsibility and accountability to pay their toll -tax to the gardener who made the 'fruit available for the enterprise'.

 An economy, A nation, a policy which fails to understand this will perish soon leaving dangerous consequences for the future.

2. **It is for the Samskruth lovers to show how Samskruth stands relevant now****, for productivity, prosperity beyond 'religion- income in a secular or theologically oriented nation'** **.** **It is for Samskruth lovers to show that 'Samskruth is not a dead (classical** **language** **) body for academic postmortem** **and learn about history ( Pathogenic nature of disease).******

 The academics who discuss the history of language are academically great! But their role and invitation should be at a time and place like the 'Medical professional who write a postmortem report' (after the accident, death and prior to burial/ cremation). That education is not the need of the hour for Samskruth in School education.

 The need is 'life-saving good medical practice' for 'handling given living person and aim to restore the Health- fitness' ! This model of doctors aim is ' send patient back to home healthy' and not to RIP , ten feet -hundred miles out of town.

3. Here is a specific quote: ([*https://www.inc.com/jeff-haden/9-best-steve-jobs-quotes-about-business-success-living-a-fulfilling-life.html*](https://www.inc.com/jeff-haden/9-best-steve-jobs-quotes-about-business-success-living-a-fulfilling-life.html%20) )



** "You can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something--your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life."**
