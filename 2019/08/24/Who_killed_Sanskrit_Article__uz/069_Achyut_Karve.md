Dear Vidwans,

  

The main question that needs to be answered is of what help is learning Sanskrit to the development of the abilities of the child. From my point of view first and foremost as a language of academics Sanskrit is an oral language as against all other languages which are written.
Learning Sanskrit (**chaste**) helps the child improve his memory and language skills. If Sanskrit grammar is taught with the right approach it will help the child to understand the structure and syntax of any other language. Lastly, Sanskrit improves diction which in turn will help the child communicate better.

  

As is said **adharma** can only be appreciated on the basis of **dharma**. If one picks up a chaste Sanskrit tongue he will be able to appreciate tongues of other languages without difficulty. If children in India are already forced to learn three corrupt languages it will be a great contribution to the child if he is taught Sanskrit (chaste) which if properly taught should help the child pick up the other three languages with ease. It is a tragedy that children in school are taught Sanskrit through vernacular languages or through English. The concept of first, second and third language should be shunned. All Indian formal languages are well evolved and they have the necessary vocabulary, structure and syntax to express all that needs to be expressed in academics. Sanskrit is no exception. 

  

All in all it is necessary that Sanskrit is taught right from 4th or 5th Std. on wards if not for itself at least for the overall development of the child. 

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
