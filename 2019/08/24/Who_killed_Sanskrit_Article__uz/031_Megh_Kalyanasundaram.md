Much of your note resonated with me, Murthy ji.

  

I wonder if there isn't another nuance here too.The author remarks that "professors of Sanskrit at Indian universities are just whiling away their time while getting hefty salaries".I would be happy to be corrected about this but if I am not mistaken, don't professors of Sanskrit at universities in US, Europe, and Australia earn substantially more than professors in India? Yet, why aren't there enough books like that of Korada Subrahmanyam ji's [Theories of Language: Oriental and Occidental](https://www.amazon.com/Theories-Language-Occidental-Korada-Subrahmanyam/dp/812460455X)?Books, like his, that:

I would be grateful to anyone who can point me to a book like that of Professor Subrahmanyam's (either before or after his book) which has been authored by someone who is on the payroll of an institution in US or in Europe?

  

Best,
