Namaste.

To summarize the issues in the article and subsequent discussions

1\. Quality of Samskrit Education & research in Universities is very low. Laziness of the professors and low IQ of students are both cited as reason. Reasons are Target language is not used in the class & writing skills are diminishing.

2\. The standard of Sanskrit studies outside India, (claims the author) is better.

  

Responses;

3\. There are many authorities in Shastras (old and few young ones).

4\. Lack of resources, support & lack policy backing are key reasons for decline.

5\. Lack of study ofother languages or other subjects by Teachers at Samskrit Universities has weakened Samskrit. (Dr Rao)

6\. There are factual errors but few valid points to ponder on too.



Through this discussion, it will be good to throw light on various initiatives happening across the country. I am sharing the one we are part of.

  

Samskrit Promotion Foundation, is focusing on school education to improve the supply "school-upwards". We provide learning teaching tools & quality training for Samskrit teachers. Enabling,equipping the teacher, is key in attracting good students to Samskrit. We realize that this has to continue for next few decades.

It will be good if scholars share the initiatives taken either by them, institutions or by others known to them, so that it benefits all.

Namaskars.
