UGC may require that students pass a test in Sanskrit before obtaining
 Ph.D. in Philosophy, Literature, history,sociology,politicsl science, economics and other humanity subjects that will benefit from the vast knowledge stored in ancient Sanskrit tests, like Vedas etc.

At the same time Sanskrit studies at high school level be offered as an optional subject to all with a proviso that an A grade in Sanskrit will elevate a B grade in another subject to an A grade.

In my days marks above 30 was added to the aggregate.

Let efforts be made to simplify Sanskrit. To start with let go of Sandhi, the process of combining words according to strict rules. It adds to style and its elitism but adds little to substance while making it difficult to understand.

Yes to the need for Sanskrit scholars and others to be knowledgeable in other old languages like Latin,Greek, Arabic etc,

Important to realize that there are many full fledged languages in India with mass following. There is no state in Bharat where people’s mother tongue is Sanskrit.

Languages like Tamil, Telugu, Hindi, Odia and others like Bengali have rich literature and social influence over millions of people through music,drama,dance and festivities.

The deva bhasha Sanskrit will take decades from now to become a manab
bhasha in Bharat.

With best wishes

Deva
