Respected Prof. Kannan,

  

I would like to say a few words noting that you mentioned IISc and being an alumnus I feel responsible as well.

In our days, going to IISc to do research was essentially based on individual's aptititude. But, I was not aware of any*special efforts* on part of the institute except for floating their annual exam date in newspapers.

Sorry to hear that if institutions are going around advertising and trying to provide incentives to draw students to do pure science then to me it is alarming. Does it mean that the priorties of younger generation is towards more lucrative professions ? Most likely.

Probably, the patience to see the fruit ripen is also not present (obviously, there will be a few exceptions).

A bee flies to draw nectar from flower (a source of food, maybe ecstasy), but the flowers being taken to bee is something which is quite a jolt.

Probably, evaluation of aptitude of prospective students is taking a backseat.

  

Please forgive if I have uttered something unfair as I have become emotional to see this.  

  

  

Best,

Raghu
