Namaste



1. I agree with the observation of Lakshminarasimhan.Krishnamurthi



2. I am highly appreciative of the good work being carried out by Samskruth Promotion Foundation to improve the 'school -upwards'.



3. On \<it will be good to throw light on various initiatives happening across the country \>,

 3a) I wish to bring to the notice of those interested in 'School-Samskruth Education', that we have an enterprise providing a
package solution focused on '**PROMOTION OF DIGITAL SAMSKRUTH LITERACY**' to

(i) ***augment and supplement*** \< SAMSKRUTH SCHOOL EDUCATION WITH DEPARTMENT TEXTS and LESSONS



 and



 (ii) **Empower SAMSKRUTH SHIKSHAKS** of SPOKEN SAMSKRUTH at Sambhashan Shibirs'>. 



 For more details, Please explore : <https://ka-naada.com/>



 3b)The work done by Achyut Karve is also useful in promoting the connection of 'ABCD/ QWERTY ' generation to Brahmi-base of Indian languages, Most important with Samskruth by highlighting the importance of early and formal school teaching of voicing using multiple patterns of vocal recitation built around Maheswara sutras.
