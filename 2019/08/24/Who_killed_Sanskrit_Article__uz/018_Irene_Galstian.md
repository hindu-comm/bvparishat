Dear Praveen Bhat,

  

Another very important feature lost is the large number of nontrivial Sanskrit sentences that gurukulas deposited verbatim directly in the students’ memory by means of repeating after the teacher.

The usefulness of this can’t be stressed enough. A large bank of ready sentences in the memory is essential for acquiring highly inflected languages. I’ve got observations from nearly 25 years of teaching Russian to non-Slavic language speakers to back this claim.

  

Irene
