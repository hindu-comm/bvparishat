Namaste,

  

I am a mathematics professor, was involved in India's participation in International math Olympiads for 15 years and have seen lot of potential which does not seem to yield proportionatly later. I can rewrite almost the same article, replacing Sanskrit with mathematics, or for that matter, any other subject!

  

Regards. . . . . Yogananda
