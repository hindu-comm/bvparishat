Wendy Doniger, the American scholar of Sanskrit and Indian Mythology, speaks effortlessly in modern, colloquial and Vedic variants of Sanskrit.  
  
- Did anyone come across anyone speaking in Vedic Sanskrit?

Does anyone know what are these modern and colloqial variants of Sanskrit?

  

The author is not capable of distinguishing between quoting profusely from laukika and Vaidika Sanskrits andspeaking effortlessly in modern, colloquial and Vedic variants of Sanskrit.

  

Seems to be some naive Sanskrit hobbyist.
