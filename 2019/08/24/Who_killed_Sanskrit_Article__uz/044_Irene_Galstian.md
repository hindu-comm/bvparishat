Immense resources are available in Saudi Arabia, but the country has  
to buy in most of the talent to do creative/scientific work. It seems  
incapable of producing its own cadres in research-related endeavours.  
  
Another example was communist Russia. Now it's true that the  
government was keen on promoting science and engineering, but the  
situation on the ground was pretty dire. Administrators and  
secretarial staff were very lax and ignored their work, you couldn't  
get the needed books at the university library. Once by some magic  
someone got the book, you had to quickly run and make Xerox copies for  
the entire class, then people made copies of copies of copies, to the  
point when the type was almost illegible. The grand edifice of Soviet  
science was built by and carried on the shoulders of a tiny minority,  
who saw the direness around them but chose to press on regardless.  
These were the university professors who stayed on until 10pm teaching  
students in their seminars, who answered every student question  
clearly and in detail, like loving parents.  
And yet, the communist party and its sidekicks were in charge, and in  
their meetings renounced these professors as potential sellouts to  
capitalism, fabricated false allegations against them, which cost some  
their lives. That's because these scientists, philologists, poets,  
etc. were intelligent and capable of creating wonderful things, and  
the mediocrities who swarmed around the communist party's protection  
hated and feared them in equal measure.  
I'm sure you see at least some parallels with the present Indian  
situation in this short trip down the memory lane.
