Namaste Dr Sastry,  
  
I couldn't agree more. Overthinking results in paralysis by analysis,  
and ideas die before they have a chance to be fully born. My teacher  
used to say that under the name of good advice people often transmit  
to the other person their own neuroses.  
The example of practically-minded and inspired people like Dr Dhaval  
Patel, S. L. Abhyankar and Acyut Karve has shown that a lot of good  
can be done with modest resources.  
By the way, I'd like to bring to the list's attention Acyut Karve's  
fascinating tabla collection on YouTube:
