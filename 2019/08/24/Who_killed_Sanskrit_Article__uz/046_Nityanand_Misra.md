The author says

  

“Once you understand Panini's ‘Ashtadhyayi’, ‘Siddhantkaumudi’ …”

  

Impressive name dropping, but then the author just exposed himself by saying

  

“The word Sanskrit originated from ‘Sans’ and ‘Krit’. ‘Sans’ means ‘something done in totality’, ‘Krit’ means ‘an accomplished piece or task’. Sanskrit therefore, is an accomplished language in its totality.”

  

Any scholar of ‘Ashtadhyayi’ worth his sodium chloride will know that there is no such thing as ‘sans’ in ‘Sanskrit’. ‘Sanskrit’ (‘Samskrita’) comes from ‘sam’ = “well” and ‘krita’ = “done, accomplished” when the sense is of “ornamentation, decoration” as implied by the rule “samparyupebhyaḥ karotau bhūṣaṇe” (6.1.137). So ‘Sanskrit’ (‘Samskrita’) actually means much more than “well-done”, it means “decorated, adorned”. It is not coincidence that Bhartrihari says “vāṇyekā **samalaṃkaroti** puruṣaṃ yā saṃskṛtā dhāryate”.

  

The whole point of the article is that Sanskrit is dead in India but safe in the hands of Westerners, pushing the agenda of Sheldon Pollock et al. One would like to know what has the author himself written in Sanskrit before pronouncing that Sanskrit is dead.

  

As for effortless speaking in Sanskrit, does the author even know what effortless speaking in Sanskrit is. One can cite many examples, but here is one of my favourites.This is Tridandi Svami Vasudevacharya ‘Vidyabhaskara’ Ji of Ayodhya speaking spontaneously and effortlessly in Sanskrit. Can the author even understand it? And does there exist any recording of Doniger speaking effortlessly in Sanskrit?
