I used to hear that IISER s are the brain children of or are the results of the ideas of Prof. Abdul Kalam who used to show concern for this situation.

The Government of India, through the[Ministry of Human Resource Development](http://mhrd.gov.in/)(MHRD), has established seven Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research (IISER). These institutes are located in Bhopal, Berhampur, Mohali, Pune, Kolkata, Thiruvanantapuram and Tirupati.

The IISERs represent a unique initiative in India where teaching and education are totally integrated with state-of-the-art research nurturing both curiosity and creativity in an intellectually vibrant atmosphere of research. Each IISER is an autonomous institution awarding its own Masters and Doctoral degrees. See the[**IISER System website**](http://www.iisersystem.ac.in/)for more details on all IISERs.
