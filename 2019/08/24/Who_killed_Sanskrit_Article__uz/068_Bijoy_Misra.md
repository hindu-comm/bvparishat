Friends,

Though the Deccan Harald article was written against Sanskrit teaching,

it has taken the shape of a larger soul-searching. The education system

in the country has to change. It still operates in the British method to

prepare people for service. We have to prepare people for thinking.

With the family setup breaking down, the schools must take a more  

active role. The rote English education does not help. Mathematics,

sciences and Astronomy must go into very early training. People must

be trained to analyze and interpret new.  We have to move from language

training to sound interpretation.

It may come, but not possibly in our life time.

Best regards,

BM
