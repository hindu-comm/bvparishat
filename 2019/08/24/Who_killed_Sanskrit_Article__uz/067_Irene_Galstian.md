It seems that Dr Narasinga Rao has now completed his project of  
teaching Sanskrit from the Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan's self-teaching  
4 volume set. The book series were intended as a 5 volume set, but the  
5th volume hasn't come out yet, and it's been a while.  
  
The 600-video collection is broken down into 4 parts, each  
corresponding to a book in the set:  
  
Book 1:

Book 2:

Book 3:
