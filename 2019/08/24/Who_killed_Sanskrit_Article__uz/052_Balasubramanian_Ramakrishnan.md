Prof. Deshpande

  

Yes, the situation is somewhat alarming. I will share my experience, I think this has been happening for sometime now. It started many decades back at least in my area, and in general science, not all of it can be ascribed to to the Trump/Republicans. It may have been exacerbated in recent times, but this has been happening a while. In my area, communication theory, the NSF used to support many research programs, many quite theoretical. In the early 90s they sent out a notice that they wanted it to be tied to “practical” stuff. This forced professors to stop thinking big ideas to what kind of dog and pony show they could come up with. I saw such discussions happening right before me many times. If this had been the original case, many of the great ideas in my field may have never come to fruition. The professors themselves complained about this privately, but there was nothing they could do. It’s a general trend toward “show me the utility right now” kind of thinking. Of course the sciences and humanities are hurt much more by this kind of thinking.
