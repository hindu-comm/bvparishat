Dear Kannanji,

This commentary is not expected from you. All Indian philosophy is pure science.

India discovered science through human speech..

There is more.. Commentaries can get loose very easily like the article we are discussing.

It is the analysis that matters. All correlation and profile work must be thrown out.

Do encourage all to analyze if we wish to move ahead. Nothing is closed. The universe is open..

More we know, more is there to be known.. Scientific thinking is not there to do bombs,  

but to understand nature, including human nature. Early Indian was the champion..

Keep scientific thinking. Discard opinionated material. We have a lot to cover.  

Sorry for this digression..  

BM
