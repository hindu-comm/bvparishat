Namaste Praveen Bhat ji



On \*exam point of view\*!



One needs to answer the question : What pedagogy, level of Samskruth teaching needs to be laid out as a plan from 'Early schooling to Post Doctoral research'.

Who has got clarity on this point ? Beyond opinions? (The UTILITY APPLICATION : VINIYOGA OF SAMSKRUTHAM, as Dr. Yadu says needs to be clear).

This opens up the line of investigation: What were the guiding policies to design the SAMSKRUTH TEXT BOOKS OF HIGHSCHOOLS in 19th and 20th century in Pre-Independence period ? How this has been meddled in post Independence period . In other words, who is guiding the 'Samskruth Education Policy' at School levels?



The relevant records to see are the school text books of different states at India, the introduction in to Samskruth grammar texts by then colonial scholars and Samskruth pundits who fitted the 'traditional content in to the given design'. I can say with certainty that Samskruth Education in Karnataka in 19th century was very clear on the objective of Samskruth Education at Schools:



The goals were very clearly laid out:



 (i) Proper articulation of Brahmi Samskruth Varnamaalaa and words (**Shuddha Uccharana**)

 (ii) Proper scripting of Samskruth and regional languages in appropriate scripts (**Shuddha Lekhana / Ukta-lekhana through
Baarakhadi - Gunita and Samyukta aksharas** )  (iii) Proper Cultural perspective and overarching connection of texts of Tradition for continuance of heritage values and ethics in the eco system of 'Bharateeyataa'.

(Note: Subhahsita's, Panchatantra, Raghuvamsha, Niti -padyas were prioritized over history, religion, caste and creed, veda-learning and the like). (**Shuddha **

**sampradaya, itihasa**)

 (iv) CULTURE FAMILIARIZATION was more important than ' LINGUISITC SCHOLARSHIP '. (**Shuddha Samskruti -** (**Shuddha Neeti**)

 (v) Shaping the Cultural perspectives of Student was more important than \***exam point of view**\* teaching. (**Shuddha Vyaktitiva**).



*Net outcome*: Students of this generation remembered 'Samskruth Teacher' ( Guru) throughout their life, even though they forgot most of the samskruth (Bhashaa) in the text beyond - 'ramah ramau ramaah'. The word 'Rama' was not a taboo in school or society !



Modern Samskruth teaching at Schools has upset this inheritance and value proposition of 'Samskruth teaching relevance in early and high schooling'.

The substitution of non-traditional Montessori model for Samskruth school teaching has turned ripples to Tsunami debate.

Namaste,



Without actually commenting on the article and its content, I'd like to list an observation of mine. While teaching Laghusiddhantakaumudi to some students, I found out that even the Kovida level study that they undergone, which is supposed to be a 4th level,has been from \*exam point of view\*! This is the basic flaw that I find in all kind of studies, be it Sanskrit, engineering when I studied it or math as Prof. Yoganandaji mentioned in this thread. The commitment to study is lacking and so is the teaching tuned to exams, solving old papers and everything is centred around scoring; thats about it! How much one really learns as to the core of any subject seems to be nobody's business.



IMO, we have, somewhere around the journey to modern success, lost the gurukula mode, wherein exams are meant only to test the knowledge and not how much one can quote shabdataH from books or apply formulae without application, as the case may be.



Kind rgds,  
--Praveen R. Bhat
