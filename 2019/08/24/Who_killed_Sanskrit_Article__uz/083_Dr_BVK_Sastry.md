Namaste KSK



1. Your response on \< tremendously trivializing Sanskrit by limiting the early teaching to acquire practical skills in a child >
and connecting it to \<Purushartha \> is a big leap. This triggers
thoughts to revisit Prof. Minkowski's Boden lecture deliberation on 'Why Teach Sanskrit ( at Oxford?) ? from an Indian context !



2. Now, If I am to rearticulate Minkowski's words for Indian context, it would read:



 **'Why Teach Sanskrit (= Colonial avatar of Paninian language: Samskrutham, using 'Colonial linguistic models , tools and pedagogy at School level' at India ? **

**'What pedagogy of teaching 'language: Sanskrit' will be able to deliver ' Purushartha' ? **

****

3. I don't have to repeat the vital differences between 'Sanskrit'
and 'Samskrutham'. The fuzziness in usage and understanding 'Sanskrit-Samskrutham -Equation' in policy levels and practical levels is not going to resolve the issue here.



4. The clarity here will define the rest of the issues: 'Who can/will teach, What content to teach, How to teach Sanskrit/Samskrutham in a graded way in public instruction system ( which goes by a different rule control than Guru-Kul model) ? Who is trained and qualified to teach the language for what objectives? How to evaluate ? ' Is there a teacher training system in place for Sanskrit/ Samskrutham in the above frame work? 



In the current scenario, the qualification to teach Samskruth at High school level Sanskrit in Karnataka is ' Sanskrit study at PUC level ( or B.A at best, maximum). This situation might have been revised lately. A B. Ed like degree to train a Samskruth teacher is yet to be seen in operation.



5. The Language policy makers for Indian Higher Education have provided documents and guidelines where the difference between the two pedagogies of Sanskrit/ Samskruth language teaching and study-goals seem to have been fuzzy. Quoting select eulogies from NCERT , policy manuals, education policy et al over the last fifty years does not seem to resolve this issue.



6. *I would request you to clarify your post* on \< tremendously trivializing Sanskrit by limiting the early teaching to acquire practical skills in a child> and explain what you intend through the pointer of \< **if shown the right direction**\> in the above light, please. And who needs to do this - Parents, Teachers, Government .. Social media..?
