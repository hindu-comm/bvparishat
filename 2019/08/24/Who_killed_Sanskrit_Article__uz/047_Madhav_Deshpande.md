Dear Irene,

  

  Due to stiff opposition to science from Trump and the Republicans in the US, many institutions like the National Institute of Science are being stifled and money being diverted to phony projects. The approach being peddled is "Yes to technology," but "No to science." Mediocrity of the ruling class is not limited to Russia and India, we are experiencing the same phenomenon here in the USA.
