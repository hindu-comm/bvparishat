After the devastation wrought by the colonial forces, the erstwhile ruling party delivered education unto the hands of Marxists whose role was only more ruinous than that of the British in respect of the traditional lore of Sanskrit and various Indian art forms. Allied studies such as archaeology etc. too suffered neglect.  

  

Education ruined, all ruination else followed suit in quick succession:

*chinne mUle naiva vRks"am na s'AkhAH!*

*

We have taken a severe, and unfair, beating at the hands of the West for the past two or more centuries - in the economic and intellectual fronts.

  

However, a new era seems to be dawning upon India, with some at the top at least at last declaring some concern for our heritage.  

A new awareness is also building up among (a small percentage, though) of the youth/the educated/the affluent - of the damage wrought so far by the imperialists &/or their agents/sepoys here. Let us hope there will be a few bright/determined minds who will take up the daunting tasks - of rectification/restoration/resuscitation/rejuvenation.  

  

Apparently, a reverse trend is afoot. It may take a century easily for something seriously happening.
