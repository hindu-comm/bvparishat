So much to agree with what is in your note, Professor Kannan.

  
With roughly US$45 trillion, [as per one estimate](https://www.livemint.com/Companies/HNZA71LNVNNVXQ1eaIKu6M/British-Raj-siphoned-out-45-trillion-from-India-Utsa-Patna.html), having been extracted from India by British,subsequent migration and transfer (of other kinds, including but not limited knowledge assets) from Britain to US,with universities like Yale in US having being initially built also on sweat and extractions from India-Madras([An astounding tale of slavery and deceit: Yale University's Madras connection](https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/astounding-tale-slavery-and-deceit-yale-universitys-madras-connection-57228)), it should hardly surprise anyone that institutions in UK have done well institutionally: would it not have been a shame to have not done well with the resources extracted! Can anyone empirically deny the correlation between the availability of resources and the quantity of high-quality scholarship?

  

India is slowly recovering and while none of the above is meant as an excuse for avoidable (if any) issues/inefficiencies that might exist within the current resource allocation matrix or in the way the incentives might be aligned, it becomes more important, in my humble opinion, to acknowledge, nay, celebrate the efforts of those scholars who operate from within much more resource-constrained environs and yet produce original, world-class scholarship.

  

Best,

Megh
