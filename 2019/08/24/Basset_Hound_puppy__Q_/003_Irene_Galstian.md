Thank you, Sir. I’ll use that option and hope for the best, maybe adding a description of the puppy. I was just making sure there wasn’t a widely accepted term already in existence, since the person I’m writing to knows Sanskrit very well but doesn’t speak English (he’s the son of our late pundit).  
  
Best wishes,  
Irene
