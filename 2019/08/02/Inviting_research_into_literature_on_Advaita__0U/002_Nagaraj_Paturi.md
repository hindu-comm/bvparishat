While Sri Yogananda-ji's work inspired by this book is valuable,

  

-   Tracing the works mentioned in the book but not available/known in
    scholarly circles. -   Studying the contents and significance of the book mentioned,
    available but less known among scholarly circles. -   Bringing into limelight books that deserve to be made known to
    Advaita saadhakas.

is what Indic Academy is now looking for.

  

If all the works mentioned in the book are already traced, # 1 above need not be taken up. I would like to know if Sri Yagananda-ji's work has rendered #1 above unnecessary.

  

#2

  

and # 3 above

  

are a different kind of a work than Sri Yogananda-ji's project.
