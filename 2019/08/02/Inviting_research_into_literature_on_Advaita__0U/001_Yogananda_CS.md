Namaste,

  

Good know about this renewed interest in Dr. Thangaswami's book. Happy to announce that this already a work in progress and some progress has been made under the benign Guidance of Ubhaya Jagadguru's of Sri Sharadapeetham, Sringeri. (Good to see that the photo used in<http://www.indictoday.com/announcements/inviting-research-literature-advaita/>is from the front of the Sri Shankara Advaita Research Centre, Sringeri; talk about divine coincidences!) You will get a glimpse of the work in progress here:<https://advaitadhara.sanatana.in/Home/>

Those interested in this project could please contact me off the list.

  

regards......yoga
