Dear friends,

As you may imagine, I have taken high resolution pictures of the site

for processing and analysis. Unfortunately I would be tied up with our  

work here with India Discovery Center for the next several months.

If any of you would have time and has technical background in image

manipulation and pattern recognition I would be glad to share the pictures.

Please write to me privately your interest and any previous work on

similar reconstruction analysis.

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
