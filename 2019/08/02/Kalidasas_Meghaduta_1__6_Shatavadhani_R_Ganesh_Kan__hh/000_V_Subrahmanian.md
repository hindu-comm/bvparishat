In this talk the renowned speaker gives a very long list, though not exhaustive, of 'doota kaavyas' in various languages, of various times. In this forum there was a discussion on this topic recently.

  

It is amazing to listen to the talk, the speaker's innate appreciation of Kalidasa and his kavyas. A real treat indeed.
