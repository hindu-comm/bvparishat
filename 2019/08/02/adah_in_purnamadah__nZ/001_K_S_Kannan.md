General note on *adas* and *idam*:

  

*adas* is *viprakRs"Ta* (distant) and

*idam* is *sannikRs"Ta* (proximate).

  

The contrast is made out as in *ayam* and *asau*.

The distinction is more easily seen in the Vedic.  

(And their referents are often linked/identified directly/indirectly).

  

Typically Aditya is *adas* and agni is *idam*.  

(Or the Lord immanent in Aditya is *adas*).

The identity of the *purus"a* "yonder" and the *purus"a* "here" is often asserted.

  

In Classical Sanskrit, *adas* is often used loosely with the very semantic value of *idam*.

(There may be more comprehensive answers for the question).
