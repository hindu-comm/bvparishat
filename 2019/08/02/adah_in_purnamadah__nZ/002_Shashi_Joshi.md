Aditya is adas, because it is far, yet we can see it. Very true.

  

And that is where my query on this shloka. pUrNamadaH is always translated as *That unmanifest is pUrNa, this manifest is pUrNa*.

  

So, if it is not *that unmanifest*, then how does the translation/explanation \[need to\] change?

  

I am considering if there is any hint of possibility of *perception* of the *unmanifest*.  
  

  
Thanks,  
Shashi
