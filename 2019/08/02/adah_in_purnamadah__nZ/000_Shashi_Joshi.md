Namaste,

In the famous पूर्णमदः पूर्णमिदं the pronoun used is अदः which doesn't mean *परोक्ष that*, but far away but visible *that*. If they really meant the unmanifest that, 'तत्' of तत्त्वमसि, why did they use अदः ?

  

Does it not have profound implication on the meaning?

I seek the opinions of the vidvajjana of this group!

  

Apologies if this was already discussed.  

  
  

Thanks,  

\~ Shashi
