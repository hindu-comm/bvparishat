Thank you so much Shri Sampathkumar ji for this post.

I had a look at the free sample and found the following comments from the author very useful.

'\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Saptarishis followed tropical zodiac with sidereal nakshatras.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The saptarishis obviously did not follow the sidereal zodiac. Instead, they followed a tropical zodiac with sidereal nakshatras.

The other evidences pointing to the use of tropical zodiac with sidereal nakshatras by the saptarishis have been discussed at length in my website [www.madhivanan.in](http://www.madhivanan.in).

-------------------

To my surprise, the nadi readers who copied the manuscripts had altered the original verse in the palm manuscript. But one could easily make out the original writing. I have reproduced that particular portion of the palm manuscript below.
