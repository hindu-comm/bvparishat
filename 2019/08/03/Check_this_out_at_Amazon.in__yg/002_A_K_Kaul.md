Dear Shri Naraya Prasadji,

Jai Shri Ram!

\<Saptarishis followed tropical zodiac with sidereal nakshatras.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The saptarishis obviously did not follow the sidereal zodiac. Instead, they followed a tropical zodiac with sidereal nakshatras.\>

Honestly, in spite of having been in astrology for the last several decades, I am still confused about "Tropical zodiac" and "Sidereal Zodiac"!

What is the definition of zodiac, and how can there be two zodiacs? And there also, we find innumerable sidereal zodiacs of different Ayanamshas!

Then again, what does sidereal nakshatras mean?

Are they 27 equal divisions or 28 unequal divisions including Abhijit, both unrelated to the namesake stars or are they somehow connected to the relevant stars?

The Surya Siddhanta, the earliest indigenous Rashi based astronomical work talks of twenty seven nakshatras, subsumed in Mesha etc. rashis, but at the same time and in the same breath, it gives polar longitudes of all the stars separately!

There is also a separate chapter in the SS about the conjunction of planets with those stars!

Does that mean that when we say that the sun is in Ashvini nakshtra, it is only an imaginary nakshatra division, since the Ashvini star itself is ten degrees away from the zero degrees of Ashvini division itself!

During the Vedic and the VJ times, as we know it by now thoroughly, there were no Mesha etc. Rashis, but only Madhu, Madhava etc. solar seasonal months. As and when Mesha etc. Rashis came to India, Mesha became a synonym of Madhava, Vrishabha that of Shukrah, Mithuna that of Shuchih and so on. That is what we find in all the Puranas! (Attachment Madhu=Chaitra)

Thus the Vedic nakshatras were quite unrelated to Rashis, whether the so called nirayana or the so called sayana! They were unrelated to the seasons in the sense that no nakshatra can be tied permanently to any seasons because of precession!

Then again, in the Vedic and Vedanga Jyotisha period, the nakshatra division started from Krittikas, Nowadays, it starts from Ashvini, without any rhyme or reason!  

The Greeks called the Vernal Equinox as First Point of Aries as it was in exact conjunction with the stars Alpha/Beta Arietis in the early centuries of CE. In Samskrit it was known as Mesharambha bindu because of the same reason. But now a days, the VE is in exact conjunction with Purva-Bhadra (Beta Pegassi). Why/How does the so called sidereal Rashichaka start from Ashvini even today?  

Confusion worst confounded!

What is all the more flabbergasting is that all the siddhantas right form the Surya Siddhanta to that of the Sidhanta Shiromani, talk of Tropical "zodiac" without exception. In fact, Munjal in tenth century had advised to correct the mismatch by making additions to the mean planetary longitudes of the SS and Arayabhatiya etc.(Attachments Alberuni)  

Even the well known astrologer famous for the Sripati house system, has advocated a tropical zodiac in his Siddhanta Shekhar! (Attachment)

In fact, I have been "hunting" for a "sidereal zodiac" in all the siddhantas and Puranas etc. but have yet to come across any! (Attachments VP and Baghavata)

That is why I feel that "astrology is the art of making correct predictions from incorrect data"!

Btw, when we say that somebody has sun in Karkata and so on---whether nirayana or saayana---we are making an absolutely wrong statement astronomically!

Sun is a star and does not move! So it is actually the earth which is in Makara and so on---whether Nirayana or sayana---depends on the respective jyotishiji! It is that superimposition of the earth on the sun that is supposed to give quite contrary results!

And Sun Sign astrology, especially the Tropical one, is really a money spinner every new year, irrespective of the fact that the sun can never move to Aries or Tauruas etc. constellations, much less the imaginary Rashis!

And still we find astrological predictions marvelously accurate, so much so that we are awarded "Nostradamus Awards" and so on! (Attachment Nostradamus Award)

But what makes me sad is that because of such infatuation with "zodiacs", we are celebrating all our festivals and muhurtas on wrong days!

God only knows when we will wake to such a situation, if at all we will ever wake to the same!

With regards and Jai Shri Ram

A K Kaul
