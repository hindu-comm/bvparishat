Dear friends,

I had posted this public lecture of mine in MIT at the inaugurartion

of their AI lab in 1997. I am re-posting it for further examination.

The preparation of this lecture was the key for me to change course

to understand the knowledge science as advocated by the Indian

philosophers. I might comment more in case people have observations

on the contents of the lecture.
