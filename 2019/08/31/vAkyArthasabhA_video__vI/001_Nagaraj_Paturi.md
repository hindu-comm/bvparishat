Thanks to Sri Dattaraj-ji for all his hard work behind not only the curation of the Vaakyaartha Sadas, Ashtaavadhaanam in Sanskrit and Mitra Vindaa ishTi but also for the intense toil behind preparing the Videos of the playlist from the video footage arranged to be shot by him.

  

Special thanks to Sri Hari kiran Vadlamani garu for funding the entire huge event of the International Vaakyaartha Sadas at such a great scale.
