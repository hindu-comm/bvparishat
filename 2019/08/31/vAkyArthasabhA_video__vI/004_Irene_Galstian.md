The whole event is a brilliant resource, and making videos available - and such well-made videos, too - means the  
whole world is enriched by this knowledge.  
I have a question for Prof Paruri about his talk. It mentions  
essential subjects being removed from Ayurveda and literature university curricula.  
But why are the curricula being cut down in this way?  
Whose initiative is this strange process?

Thank you,  
Irene
