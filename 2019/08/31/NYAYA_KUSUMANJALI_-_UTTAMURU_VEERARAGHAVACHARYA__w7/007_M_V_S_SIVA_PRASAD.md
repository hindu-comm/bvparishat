Paturi sir,  
Agni is back because I replied via my e.mail. I don't know why it comes like that when I replied via e.mail. I never changed my settings in the group . If I post directly in the group it comes as M.V.S.SIVA PRASAD and when I reply via e.mail it comes as agni. I really don't know how to change it also . Please suggest me how to correct it.  
Thank you.
