Pranam  
  
Rgveda Dar≈õana (currently available in 16 volumes) is an attempt to present traditional approach towards vedas through Adhi-Yajna, Adhi-Daiva and Adhyatmika viewpoints.  

Rgveda Darsana has been published by and is project of Kalpatharu Reaserch Academy (a division of Sringeri Mutt).  
Volumes hitherto published can be bought on [profskr.com](http://profskr.com).  

I couldn't find them online in PDF or any other format.
