Namaste,

  

My experience has been to the contrary, though very limited. But scholars whom I have interacted with have high regards of those volumes. While it is true that many Vidwans were involved in the production, it seems like consolidation and writing has been done mainly by a couple of the Editors - notably, Dr. G N Chakravarthi.

  

regards......yoga
