Sarvebhyo Namah

I am facing difficulty of finding a good Vedic book/Reader which is written in Indian perspective, elaborate/exhaustive and makes student understand the intent of Rshi. It should give specialities of Vyakarana. Better if available in English. What else? We need one stop solution.

  

I tried Mac Donnell, Peter Peterson, Sitanatha shastri (Calcutta university 1944) and Rgveda bharati byShivakumara svami, Rksukta Vaijayanti of MN Joshi in vein.

  

Only exception being Sayanabhasya with Kannada translation by HP Venkat Rao (Mysore palace edition)

  

I request all the Scholars to help us if something is available in this regard.
