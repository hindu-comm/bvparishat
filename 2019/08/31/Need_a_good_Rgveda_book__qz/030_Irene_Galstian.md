Here's the scan of introductions and tables of contents (where available) of vols 1-5 and 12.2-16 of SK Ramachandra Rao's work.  

I'm working on getting access to the remaining volumes. In the meantime, the available volumes will get scanned gradually.  

If you're particularly interested in a certain volume, please say so, and yours will be scanned first.
