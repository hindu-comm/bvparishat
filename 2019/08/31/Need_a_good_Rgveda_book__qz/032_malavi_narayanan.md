Namassabhaayai.

Instead of chasing behind the various translations that may be available, it is my humble opinion that the best bet would be to do Veda adhyayana fully, then, read kaavyapaatha, vyakarana and a little of nyaya and then head on to reading the Veda bhasyas IN SAMSKRTA itself. If using a translation is a better way of understanding the Veda bhasyas, our maharshis would not have left it undone till the 21st century. The very fact that they have not stepped down to anything lesser than samskrta is enough testimony to show that the bhasyas are fit to be read ONLY by those who have had the training mentioned above in the same hierarchy. I humbly opine there can never be fruitful shortcuts in this regard.

  

There are numerous Veda patashalas in India where after ghanaanta adhyayana, Veda bhasyas are studied in the traditional atmosphere. Veda bhavanam - Hyderabad; Shrutiram Gurukulam, Bangalore, are to mention a few places where this is followed. I have listed only those I know of. There are hundreds of such places in India presently. Request scholars to contact these places to get familiar with the Veda bhasyas , rather than pursuing this wild-goose chase of placing various translations.

  

Regards

Malavi Hari
