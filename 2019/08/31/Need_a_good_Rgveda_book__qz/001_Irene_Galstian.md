Sir, collecting translations of the bhashyas has been my dearest wish for a number of years, with not much luck.  

If we leave aside the Kannada translation (which gives us all hope!), there seems to be no translation into any language of Sayana and Bhaskaramisra. This is the state with the two key Vedic commentators.  

By now I don't think it's important into which language the translation is, as long as it's into some language. We'll probably reach a better place sooner if every interested person tries to translate a small piece of the commentary as best they can, others will correct and augment those translations, the next ones will add their own comments, and so we'll all benefit.
