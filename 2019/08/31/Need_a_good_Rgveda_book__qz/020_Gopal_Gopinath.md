Namaste, Shri Prof Pandurangi,

  

<http://www.vedicgranth.org/home/the-great-authors/mr-jambunathan/veda>

  

Shri (late) Jambhunathan had attempted to translate veda bhashyas following sayana's commentaries. These are available for download from the above link.

  

Shri AS Ramanathan had attemtped, in English, to bring out the ideas of Shri Madhusudhan OJha of 19th century. He was from Tamil Nadu but his works were in English.

  

OMC Namboodribad had done a malayalam translation based on Sayana's but adding his contributions like in the lines of the kannada work. It is not available in English so far.

  

Similar to Velankar's Ghosh had attempted a translation of 100 verses. I have a pdf of it and can share privately.  

  

Nepali group (Prasanna Chandra) had released an intro book that outlines their methodology of translation giving interesting peek into how the minds focusing on rig veda work! this too i have a personal pdf for private sharing.

  

If you or shankaraji or anybody else could point out to the works or share their pdfs mentioned earlier - Sitanatha shastri (Calcutta university 1944) and Rgveda bharati byShivakumara svami, that woudl be helpful.

  

Thanks

..gopal gopinath
