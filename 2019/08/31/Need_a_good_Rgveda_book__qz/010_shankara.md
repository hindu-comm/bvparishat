Irene ji,  
  

I too have seen only the 1965 edition of Telang & Chaubey in DLI collection. Regarding the Vedic Selections ed. by KC Chatterji, its Part 3 is available online at  

<https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.313677> . Itis 1957 edition.  

  

The publishers might have combined the parts in re-prints. I have not seen the latest editions of these books.

  

regards  
shankara
