I have heard from elders that although The Jayachamarajedra series of translations were well-intentioned it turned out to be of poor quality as a system of sub-contracting the work to more needy less greedy scholars was in play. I hope and wish that what I am saying is not true. There was a time when the whole set was available for a paltry amount.

Regards,

Murthy
