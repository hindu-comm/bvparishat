Gopalji,

  

I have not come across Sivakumara Swami's Vedic Reader.

  

There is 'Srautapatha' in 2 parts (Samhitas and Brahmanas) edited by Sitaram Sastri, published by Uni. of Calcutta in 1942. It contains only the sasvara text with bhashya, there is no translation or notes. Links are given below.

  

Srautapatha Part 1 Samhitas

Srautapatha Part 2 Brahmanas

regards  
shankara
