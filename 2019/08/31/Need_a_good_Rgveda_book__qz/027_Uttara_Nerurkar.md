Dear Shri Pandurangi,  
You may like to check out the Rgveda Bhaashya of Swaami Dayaananda Saraswatee, along with its preface Rgveda-aadi-bhaashya-bhoomikaa that are available by post from the Paropkaarinee Sabhaa, Ajmer. These are extremely scientific and based on ancient commentaries like the Braahmanas, Nirukta, etc.

Regards,  
Uttara Nerurkar.
