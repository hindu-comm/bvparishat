Namaste,

  

I am happy to mention that a project to translate into English, 36 volumes (about 32,000 pages) of the Rigveda samhita in Kannada, published under the Sri Jayachamarajendra Vedaratnamala series is taking shape. Those who are interested in helping us with this task are requested to write to me off the list, so that I can take that into account while finalising the proposal.

  

regards......yoga
