The Arya Samaj interpretation of the Vedas was not much in demand from traditional Vedic scholars.In fact,there was a Vedic Magazine published from Lahore before independence,but,it was also not much taken note of by many Vedic scholars.I was surprised to know that it is not mentioned by Prof.R.N.Dandekar ji in his volumes ofVedic Bibliography. Hence,many Sanskrit and Vedic scholars are innocent about its existence.Very strange.
