> > "The present work is a study of the Aṣṭādhyāyīof Pāṇini from a new > perspective. It attempts to explore the Pāṇinian system of Sanskrit > grammar from a formal point of view and investigate the possibilities > of representing it in a logical, explicit and consistent manner. It > puts forward an appropriate framework for such a representation. > Differing from the formulation of Aṣṭādhyāyī, which is composed in an > artificial yet natural language and is meant to be employed by > individuals who are acquainted both with the Sanskrit language and the > techniques of grammar, the present rendering aims for a non-verbal > representation in terms of mathematical categories and logical > relations which can be implemented in an algorithmic manner. >

Moreover, it would furnish the basis for a computer > implementation of the grammar. Both these aspects are objects of > enquiry in the field of theoretical studies on Pāṇini as well as the > emerging discipline of Sanskrit computational linguistics. This book > takes on the ground-work in these areas." >
