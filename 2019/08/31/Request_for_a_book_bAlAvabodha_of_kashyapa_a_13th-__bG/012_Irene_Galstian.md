Shankara ji,

  

Big, big thanks. Now no need to fiddle with the VPN.

I'll report back once there is progress on the book.

One question, please. The matter of Sanskrit works in Sinhalese script arose previously, and there was a procedure to turn it into transliteration, if not into Devanagari.

The first step was to use Google or that guy's OCR app (I don't recall his name now, sorry, it's been a while, and this issue doesn't come up often).

And then someone linked to a site that generates the translit. Do you by any chance recall this site? My thinking is that, since this work is judged as significant by Belvalkar, then removing the obstacle of Sinhalese script could be an advantage, so more people could read the treatise. What do you think?

  

Best wishes,

Irene
