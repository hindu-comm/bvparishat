Irene ji,

  

The first 3 vols of 'The Orientalist' are in the open domain and are available at Google Books. Links are given below.

  

The Orientalist  

vol 1 - <https://books.google.co.in/books?id=iAopAAAAYAAJ>  
vol 1 & 2 - <https://books.google.co.in/books?id=Q2E-AQAAMAAJ>  
vol 2 & 3 - <https://books.google.co.in/books?id=uwopAAAAYAAJ>

  

As Prof. Deshpandeji mentioned, the text of Balavabodhana published in 'The Orientalist' is incomplete. It seems there is a complete edition of Balavabodhana. For publication details, please check.

regards  
shankara
