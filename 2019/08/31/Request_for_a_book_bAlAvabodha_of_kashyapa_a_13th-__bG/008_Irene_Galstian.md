Dear Professor Deshpande,

  

Thank you, this is obtainable.

If no existing electronic copy is located by other list members, I can order this. However, the electronic copy should be most easily available from within the US:

  

<https://catalog.hathitrust.org/api/volumes/oclc/6430564.html>  

  

Could you please have a look at the above link and see if it allows you to leaf through the journal, while I adjust my proxy settings?

  

Best wishes,

Irene
