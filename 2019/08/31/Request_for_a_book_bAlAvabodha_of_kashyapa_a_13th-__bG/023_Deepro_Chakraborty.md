Dear Prof. Deshpande, Irene and Shankara Ji,

  

I am very grateful to you for the information you shared. I required just the beginning of the text which I found from the [link](https://books.google.co.in/books?id=Q2E-AQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false)(page: 69) that Shankara ji shared.

  

Thanking you,

Deepro
