Shankara ji,  
  
True, very true. I can read the script but slowly.  
The site for translit didn’t work, but there was a link to  
the coder’s github space, where I found a piece of  
Python code that did work. That’s really what I want to find, that Python code.  
Perhaps Prof Deshpande could view the PDFs and advise  
whether it’s worth making this work more easily available.  
  
Best wishes,  
Irene
