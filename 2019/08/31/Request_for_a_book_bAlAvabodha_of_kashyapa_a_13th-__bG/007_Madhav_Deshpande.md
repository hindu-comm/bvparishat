Dear Deepro,

  

  On p. 41 of the attached document you will see some references to a grammar titled Bālāvabodhana by Kashyapa. Here is a reference to the incomplete publication of this work: "Kasyapa'sBalavabodhana, edited by William Goonetilleke, The Orientalist 1 (1884) 2 (1885)." You can check for this volume of "The Orientalist." If you make a copy of this work, send me a pdf. Best,
