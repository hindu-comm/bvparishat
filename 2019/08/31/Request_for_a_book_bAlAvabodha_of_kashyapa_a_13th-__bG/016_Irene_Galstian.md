Dear Professor Deshpande,

  

Thank you for agreeing to help, this is most valuable. I'll send you the link of the scan once the book gets here.

If you decide that the work is interesting, we'll find a way of obtaining the transliteration and/or Devanagari by software means.

  

Best wishes,

Irene
