Shankara ji,

  

Thank you for that information.

The Orientalist volumes are in the public domain in some countries but not in others. If you have access to the PDFs, please could you download them from your side.

As for the WorldCat entry, I also saw this about an hour ago and placed an interlibrary loan request for it. This edition is in Sinhalese script too, so, at least to get started, it would be useful to give Deepro Chakraborty both items, if possible.

  

Best wishes,

Irene
