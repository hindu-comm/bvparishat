Irene ji,

  

Sanskrit OCR website is <http://ocr.sanskritdictionary.com/>

  

But it may not work for Sinhalese script. I feel Google OCR might be suitable for this purpose. Proof-reading the OCR text would not be easy, unless one knows the Sinhalese script. It would be ideal to wait till some such person volunteers to participate in the work.  

  

regards  
shankara
