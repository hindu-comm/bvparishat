I've ordered my copy about 2 weeks ago, and it's been promised to get  
here around mid-September. This is with the upgraded Amazon delivery,  
otherwise it would have been more like mid-October. Is there a way to  
access the table of contents and the bibliography in the meantime?  
Especially the bibliography.  
  
Best wishes,  
Irene
