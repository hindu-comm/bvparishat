This paragraph in their post says:

  

Participation in the “Purohit Utkarsh Shivir” will provide an opportunity to be associated with Vaidic Dharma Sansthan Trust, The Art of Living Foundation thereby benefiting the society with their Vaidic Knowledge, Rituals and customs.  

  

  

I think Purohits well get opportunity to perform rituals.
