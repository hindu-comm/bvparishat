Respected Scholars,  

  Can you give me an information about whether there is any book/Research Paper on influence of Jaydeva, writer of Chandraloka on later Vaishnava Rasasastra.

                                   
Yours Sincerely,

                                   
 

                                   
   Ms. S. Sinha.
