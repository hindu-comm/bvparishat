Pranaams to All,

  

I am happy to release the book cover of three volume book on Advaita Vedanta written by Dr K Sadananda also known as Acharya Sadaji. The three volumes contain 221 articles on various topics relating to Vedanta. Dr Sadaji participated in three discussions groups over a decade and one of the groups he founded is called Advaitin group. His responses in these discussion groups have been converted into articles and finally into a book.

  

We will be shortly releasing this at the forthcoming Conference on Oneness.

  

Regards

  

Hari
