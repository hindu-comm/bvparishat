namah sarvebhyo.  
  
Megh-ji Thanks for sharing this. I liked it!  
  
The thought of using shrImadbhagavadgItA as a vehicle for learning many concepts and prayoga-s of saMskR^itaM crosses my mind, often, as I study the language as well as the gItA.  
  
As I study the gItA, I also try to note the candas / vRtta-s of the zlokA-s.  
  
I wonder if there is a study, or at least a list, of all the candas / vRtta-s appearing in the gItA?  
Although most of the zlokA-s are generically in anuSTup, not all the anuSTup-s seem identical. There seem to various types of anuSTup.  
  
There are many triSTup-s (11 x 4) in different vRtta-s, eg:  
BG 2.22 : “वासांसि जीर्णानि यथा विहाय...”  
This seems to be a विषम वृत्त of type जाया  
  
BG11.43 : “पितासि लोकस्य चराचरस्य...”  
This seems to be a विषम वृत्त of type माला  
  
BG2.70 : “आपूर्यमाणमचलप्रतिष्ठं...”  
This seems to be a विषम वृत्त... but not sure if type...  
  
There are many in such the 11th (विश्वरूपदर्शन योग) adhyAya, for eg, which are all arjuna’s stuti of the bhagavAn.  
  
There are several 11x4 in the 15th adhyAya.... but  
BG15.3 : “न रूपमस्येह तथोपलभ्यते...”  
seems a bit irregular (12 akSara-s in the first pAda?)  
  
Regards  
prabhu
