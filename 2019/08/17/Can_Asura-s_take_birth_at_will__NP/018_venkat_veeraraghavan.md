Dear Sir,  

  

Please dont take the following personally.

  

Not to be literal on texts based on current knowhow and knowledge suffers from a few drawbacks.

There are some key assumptions inherent in this statement-->

  

1\. Modern kali yugi people with next to zero niyama and tapasya somehow seem to have acquired the ability and the intellect to judge the work of Valmiki....I am not sure how your position is any different from that of Max Muller and Co. (How many have even done adhyayana of 1 veda? 2 vedas 3? 4? Vedangas???)

2\. We are to customise whatever Vyasa and Valmiki have recorded based on our limited knowledge and subject to our own modern prejudice...very convenient indeed and self serving to boot.

3\. How many in this day and age have even mastered 1 veda? I am not talking about adhyayana. Mastery is different.

4\. How many have the yogabala and tapobala to comment on the upalabdhis of characters from the Ramayana? This is akin to a kindergarten child panning the works of Gauss and Newton since all his problems are solved with counting on 10 fingers.

5\. How do you expect evidentiary analysis when the man of this age is so fallen in morality and discipline? Would you expect academic engineering /scientific/ linguistic rigour from a post nuclear poplulation concentrating on survival? This is roughly the state of man now, where there is nothing on his horizon beyond artha and kama.

  

Humility does not lie in addressing each other in polite tones alone but in approaching knowledge with the necessary openness and surrender so that the śakti can permeate the śrota.

  

Without Gurubhakti knowledge is less than useless. Vyasa and Valmiki are primal Gurus and to doubt what they have transmitted or to put a personal spin on it in order to appear "sane" in a company of "intellectuals" is disingenuous.

Questioning a real Guru is as good as questioning one's parent. How many of us demanded a DNA certificate from our parents for that matter?  

  

This is not about having an opinion.

What we need to consider is if we merit the right to hold one in the first place.

  

Namaskarams.

  

Kind Regards,

  

Venkat
