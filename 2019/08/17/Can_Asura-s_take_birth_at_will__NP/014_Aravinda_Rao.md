I am wondering whether Subrahmanian ji is testing us by initiating this discussion. He is a teacher of Advaita Vedanta and he is aware of what it says. Sri Shankara, in his bhashyam makes it clear in several places that the gods and demons are not handsome and ugly persons fighting in the skies. They are our own tendencies - one, refined by the study of shastras and the other, unrefined, ugly and base tendencies. For instance, in the Chandogya Up 1-2-1 he tells -देवाः शात्रोद्भासिता इन्द्रिय वृत्तयः, असुराः तद्विपरीताः,॥॥। अन्योन्याभिभवोद्भवरूपः ॥॥देवासुर सङ्ग्रामः....( I could not type the whole passage due to difficulty in typing).

He reiterates the same in the Brihadaranyaka Up (1-3-1) too and calls itआध्यात्मिक सङ्ग्रामः an internal battle.

The puranas give flesh and blood to these 'persons' but Vedanta treats them as ideas in our own minds.

  

Similar is the fate of heavenly worlds. In the Isa Up (mantra 3) bhashyam Sri Shankara explains ..लोक्यते इति लोकः, that which is seen, experienced is loka ....लोकाः अनुभूयन्ते इति जन्मानि. The so called heavenly or hellish worlds are mere experiential states, if we can say so. They are not three dimensional places somewhere located in the space, as per Vedanta. All Vedanta teachers explain them in the same way.

For authoritative clarification we may listen to Swami Paramarthananda or Swami Tattvavidananda or any traditional Vedanta teacher who have explained these mantras.
