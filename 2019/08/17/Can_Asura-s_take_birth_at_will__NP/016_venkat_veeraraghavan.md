Dear Shri Subramanian Ji--  

  

Yes a Yogi can enter a living person too. I stand corrected.

There is another case where the disciple Vipula enters the body of Ruci to perform stambhana on her senses in order to protect her from the designs of Indra. (Anushasana parva MB)

  

"And, O hero, with respect to the fear that is in thy heart rising from Arjuna, we have already settled the means for slaying Arjuna. *The soul of the slain Naraka* hath assumed the form of Karna. Recollecting his former hostility he will encounter both Kesava and Arjuna. And that mighty warrior and foremost of smiters, proud of his prowess will vanquish Arjuna in battle as also all thy enemies."

  

"And Karna also, his soul and faculties possessed by the inmost soul of Naraka, had at that time cruelly determined to slay Arjuna."

  

WRT:

"It is not a case of an Asura X determining to take a particular birth in a particular place/household to accomplish a pre-determined mission. Vishnu's incarnating in the house of Dasaratha and as the child of Vasudeva-Devaki are instances of this type in the case of non-Asura. "

When you ask of Asuras making Sankalpa to be born as Vishnu did, you may be overlooking something.

  

The narrative voice in both epics is that of Valmiki and Kṛṣṇa Dvaipayana who are representing the pov of the devas and their arc.

  

There are still some references one can get for the other pov in the Uttara Ramayana where the story of Kaikasi's dalliance with rṣi Viśravas

The story of penance of the brothers is an expression of sankalpa alone.

The difference is due to tamas being associated with the asura vritti instead of expressing itself before conception, it expresses after.

  

Since ultimately the root of good and evil is the same virat-puruṣa or Garbodakashayi Viṣṇu the primordial dreamer who spawns every thread including the modifying the curse on Jaya and Vijaya....the answer for your question lies there alone.

  

Kind Regards,

  

Venkat
