Dear Smt Irene ji--  

  

I am not suggesting malevolence.

  

Merely stated someone's experience of kAmarUpa siddhi...the fellow does not know what he saw, only that he really saw it and did not dream it.

He fell unconscious because the unreal nature of what he saw hit some part of his psyche and as a coping mechanism he lost consciousness. This is just my theory.

  

Regards,

  

Venkat
