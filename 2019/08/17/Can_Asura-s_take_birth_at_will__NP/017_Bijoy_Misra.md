Sri Bijoy Ji--> In the interests of open discourse kindly enlighten me on what fallacy you found in the narrative I gave you. May be there is or may be there isn't. Ignoring is not going to change facts. If you are really interested in open discussion ignoring is not an option.  

  

Dear Friend,

"open discussion" needs as evidentiary basis and analysis.

As I said all can be explained through Sankhya and Nyaya. Just analyze more.

It may take time to analyze, please don't be literal on texts.  

Again, you are free to have your opinion.

Thank you.

BM
