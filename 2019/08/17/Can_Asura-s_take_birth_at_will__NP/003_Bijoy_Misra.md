Dear friends,

I doubt the interpretation that an Asura makes any change in body. I have no difficulty in understanding that

an Asura is a regular human being, animal or insect with different propensities., The latter can be built in

or developed through practice. The particular example of Maricha could be one of camouflage with dresses

and wigs. Ravana did that himself not to the extent Maricha did.  

Please take individual incidents and analyze. You might see merit in this line of thinking.

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra

  

PS. There is an asuric(!) nature in all of us. They can manifest and sometimes can be developed!
