This is a case of asura-s entering the already existing persons/bodies such as Duryodhana and Karna with a view to achieve destruction of good, etc. It can come under the yoga siddhi of 'para kaaya pravesha.' It is not a case of an Asura X determining to take a particular birth in a particular place/household to accomplish a pre-determined mission. Vishnu's incarnating in the house of Dasaratha and as the child of Vasudeva-Devaki are instances of this type in the case of non-Asura. 

  

Sri Nagaraj Paturi ji has clearly phrased the intent of my original post.
