Dear Shri Bijoy ji--

  

I will just highlight a third person account. Please draw your own conclusions.

  

I was in Prayagraj for the Kumbhamela around the time of the third and final shAhi snAn and I stayed with the family of an army officer friend who has a house 200 metres from the sangam.

His son a 20 year old boy who does not believe in any thing traditional also happens to be a rapper. He sleeps with his lights on at night.

He told me a story of staying for a recording gig at Dvarka (in New Delhi) above the recording studio. He is part of a team of three rappers. He said there were strange yantras/mandalas drawn on the walls. He called his friend on the mobile who said he was 1 hour away (this was at 10PM). 5 minutes later there was a knock on his door and his friend turned up. When he asked how he reached so soon, his friend said he was having fun with him etc..and then he noticed that his friend's eyes started changing....the fellow fainted and was woken up by his friend who came around 12 midnight shocked to see his door open and his friend lying on the floor.

  

When the two shared stories they immediately left that flat and fled to a friend's house.

  

I can understand your academic necessity to model the universe based on what is consensually accepted as 'fact'. But it also stands to reason that in order to dissect fact in a truly objective light significant experience in the wider world is also required. This experience cannot be measured in years alone but in opportunity / prarabdha.

  

Let me give an analogy you might understand:

  

Assume I am a beggar who earns Rs. 100 per day on the streets of Chennai..my days are filled with my day to day struggle to make ends meet. I then meet someone who says they are from Los Angeles where there are people who walk that are white as snow, there are opulent houses and big movie stars.

I am not going to believe that because my reality is all I know.

Also being a person of little importance i have neither the money to buy a ticket nor the ability to get a visa for who will give me one?

Nope..Chennai is my well and there is no other.

  

Assume I am a middle class worker labouring in Chennai at some random office...I have seen Los Angeles on the internet and I believe in it because enough people I know have been there and have come back. Some of the colleagues' children work/study there and they share photos. I myself may not have the money to go there or be able to get a visitors visa because I have other fish to fry. But I believe in Los Angeles and I know that the world is big enough to house races different to mine--brown, black and white.,.I know humans come in all colours shapes and sizes.

  

Now Assume that I am a rich cricketer/movie star/business person..I routinely travel to LA for pleasure/profit and i have many friends of different races, for me the multiracial nature of humankind is an axiom not something I have to believe in like religion...or something I have to infer.

  

To have experience of different astral beings again is more to do with one's own current evolution and not an imagined or constructed fact.

This is a zeitgeist where there is no niyama, no tapasya no Brahmacharya. When there is no currency at all, how are we to "experience" ? People waste time watching reality TV, cricket, fighting on social media over inconsequential issues and split hairs on trivia. Truly mediocre in every sense.

  

So we stick to what we see (and are sure others can also see), what we hear and what we choose to believe...so that we can get by without being considered insane.

In short what we believe is the least common belief of almost every other person whose respect or love we expect.

  

Thanks for reading,

  

Kind Regards,

  

Venkat
