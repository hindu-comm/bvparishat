Thanks Venkat ji for the above story of pre-Karna life.<http://storibuzz.in/the-story-of-sahasra-kavacha/> According to this narrative at one time Sahasrakavacha was absorbed into Surya but not able to stand his troubles, it was Surya who decided to get rid of him and the occasion of Kunti praying to Surya became the medium for Surya to cause Sahasakavacha's birth as Karna and thereby bring about his end. And the story goes to say that due to his association with Surya, Sahasrakavacha had some very good qualities.

  

We do hear about his daana.

It looks like parayaka pravesha is about entering into only dead bodies. But this commentary of Swami Vivekananda for Yoga sutra 3.38 (sometimes 39) one can enter another living body as well<https://hinduism.stackexchange.com/questions/10374/what-exactly-happens-during-parakaya-pravesha>-


  

//Here is commentary of Swami Vivekananda on this verse

The Yogi can enter a dead body, and make it get up and move, even while he himself is working in another body. Or he can enter a living body, and hold that manâ€™s mind and organs in check, and for the time being act through the body of that man.//  
  

There is an instance in the MB where a Brahmavadini by name Sulabhaa enters a certain live King Janaka's body and conducts a long conversation with him by being inside his body. Here it is not the case of a dead body. This instance is cited in the BSB by Shankara.
