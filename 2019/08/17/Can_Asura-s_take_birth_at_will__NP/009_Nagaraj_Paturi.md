Dear friends,.

  

In an academic discussion, if a member asks a question such as does a Rakshasa take birth at his will in a form that he wants,

  

it should be taken as

  

Is there a narrative in the literature whereRakshasa taking birth at his will in a form that he wants is depicted?

  

The actual possibility of such a happening is neither part of the original question nor is it within the scope of the academic discussion intended.

  

If there are such narratives, let us post and discuss.

  

Otherwise, it does not hurt to wait until someone comes up with an example.

  

Thanks and regards,
