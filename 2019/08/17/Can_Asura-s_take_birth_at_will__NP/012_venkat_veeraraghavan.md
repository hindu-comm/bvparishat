Shri Subramanian ji

  

If you take the pramaNa of other texts like the Narayaneeya Dambodbhava / Sahasrakavacha was born as Karna with the last kavacha. SInce he took refuge of the Sun, Surya was also his upasya devata...

  

Duryodhana was also said to have been the amsa of kali purusha going by Vyasa's explanation after the war.

  

Whether they actually took a sankalpa of destruction I cannot say, but the inferrence can be made by seeing how Karna competed with Nara (Arjuna) and was jealous of him.

They could not bear each other although both had knowledge of dharma and noble qualities. This is something only pUrva vasana can achieve.

  

The episode after ghoshayatra tends to drive home the issue of sankalpa where in kAlanemi and other asuras take the sankalpa of killing Arjuna and others. This is not a case of parakayapravesha which would imply taking the place of an empty shell like Tirumular did with Mulan the cowherd.

This is more a case of reinforcing the belief of an existing asura.

How else do you explain Karna's stoic belief in his own invincibility and his repeated boasting despite being repeatedly defeated in battle by Arjuna, Bhima, Satyaki and Abhimanyu that too when he was present with his army and had continuous supply of chariots and weaponry?

This is merely the Asura vritti projecting itself. The inability to live with or acknowledge Satya / reality is Asuric.

  

Sri Bijoy Ji--> In the interests of open discourse kindly enlighten me on what fallacy you found in the narrative I gave you. May be there is or may be there isn't. Ignoring is not going to change facts. If you are really interested in open discussion ignoring is not an option.
