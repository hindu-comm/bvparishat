Dear Shri Bijoy ji

  

Until a person has personal experience of kAmarUpa siddhi and any of the other ashtamaha siddhis it remains an exercise in rationalisation. Once you experience something that cannot be rationalised with the mind, either the mind evolves into a new realm of awareness or the mind and the body construct an alternate fantasy like the "Life of Pi"..

That does not mean that Maricha used wigs etc to deceive.

Rama must be exceptionally stupid to fall for a bahurupi act with props.

  

The epic does not support that Sri Rama was lacking in anyway in the mental department.

  

Asura is a vritti and a yoni..interestingly certain versions of the Ramayana in describing the samudramanthan describe the asuras as the ones who rejected vAruNi the goddess of liquor and the suras as ones who accepted her as their share.

  

Other sources seem to indicate that vAruNi went with the asuras, but i digress.

  

Generally the sense that we get is that the Suras, Asuras, danavas, rakshasas are distinct groups of astral / interdimensional beings with powers beyond what humans possessed. There is a record of a Sanyasi having travelled to Indraloka with the help of gagana gutikas.

  

Regarding Subramanian ji's original query, yes it is definitely possible.

  

However what you and I consider as "evil" is mainly a short cut route to power for that person/entity.

  

The Devas show what higher qualities we must embrace and asuras show what sort of one pointed determination we must have in pursuit of self improvement...the phrase asura-thapas is a Tamizh one that highlights the unique capacity of the asuras in this regard.

One cannot exist without the other and they seem to be some sort of a balancing act.

When both qualities are combined we get people like Amsuman, Bhagiratha, Dhadhichi.

  

Since you asked for specific examples, in the MB after the disaster of the ghosha yatra where Duryodana, Karna and Co. were defeated by the Gandharvas and saved by Arjuna ...Duryodhana dying with shame, sits in prAya vowing to fast till death.

He then has a clear astral vision where Asuric forces perform a yajna to summon Duryodhana and certain personalities like kAlanemi and others are said to tenant key characters like Karna and Duryodhana to bring about the necessary denouement.

  

The Rakshasas destroyed sacrifices because the sacrifices strengthened the Devas..it was not an act of random cruelty. Indra himself killed his priest Vishvarupa because he was offering havis to the asuras which was an act of treachery.

  

It is interesting that you mention Asuras take birth with the sankalpa of disturbing society.

The society we live in is hardly what can be called dharmic or even ethical.

If I am not mistaken our society is being run by asuras.

Often the choice is between a bigger and a lesser evil.

  

Kind Regards,

  

Venkat
