I admire your dream, Dear Patel-ji: Machine Translation of the Ramayana!

MT has yet a long long way to go!

  

While many fantasies of science fiction have actually come about, the overconfidence displayed by Herbert Simon in the seventies of the last century is not getting even faintly realised: that computers would be understanding humour, or interpreting Shakespeare &c. - and all in a matter of twenty-five years!

  

It is the ALPAC Report that knocked some sense into the mind of the "experts" of "Mechanical Translation" of those times - of the labyrinth of complexity that the phenomenon of language is - well captured by Nirenberg and others.
