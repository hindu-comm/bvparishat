1\. I found the Sanskrit files of Katre and Old Testament and shared  
them with Shreevatsa and GSS Murthy. If the notifications haven't come  
through, please briefly check your spam folder, or simply write back,  
and I'll resend.  
  
2. The book mentioned by Professor Kannan seems to be this:  
  
<https://cul.worldcat.org/title/bharatiyam-vrttam-e-e-mekdonalkrtasya-indiyas-past-ityasya-samskrtanuvadah/oclc/223549565&referer=brief_results>  
  
I've filled in a request for it. Professor Kannan, if this isn't the  
book, please respond with a correction, so I keep looking for the one  
you had in mind.  
  
3. Shankara ji, this one is for you. There was (on archive) a Sanskrit  
translation of the first 9 or so chapters of Macdonell's History of  
Sanskrit Literature, but I can't find it. If you have seen it  
somewhere, please help.  
  
4. If anyone is aware of more such translations, especially  
translations well done (in either direction), please mention them, so  
we can gather a large enough collection of reliable parallel  
sentences.  
  
Thank you ,  
Irene
