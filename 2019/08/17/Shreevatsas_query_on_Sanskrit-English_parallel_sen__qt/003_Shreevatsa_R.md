Thank you, yes please update this thread with any sources you can find/recall for a substantial number of Sanskrit sentences translated into English (or vice-versa). All input would be useful, but most useful would be texts that are:

\- substantial in extent (at least a few tens of thousands of sentences -- or at least a book length say),  

\- digitally available already (i.e. as copyable text rather than book scans), so that extract text does not require retyping or OCR,

\- in the public domain.

  

Roughly this means:  

\- Public domain: If I understand correctly, as of 2019, in India, any book by an author who died before 1959 (and published before the author's death) is in the public domain, and in the US any text published before 1924 is in the public domain. No doubt a large number of Sanskrit texts were translated into English in this period.

\- Digitally available: I imagine that most of these are available only as scanned copies, and for only a small fraction of these are the Sanskrit and English texts available in digital form (e.g. the text can be searched). I would be happy to be proven wrong. :-)

  

With thanks,

Shreevatsa
