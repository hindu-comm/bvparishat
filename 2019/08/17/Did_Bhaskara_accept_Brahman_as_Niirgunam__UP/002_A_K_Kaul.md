Dear Shri Subrahmanianji,

Jai Shri Ram!

Everybody has his/her own views about what moksha means. Commentators on the Gita are no exception.

The dichotomy of saguna and nirguna is an everlasting one and will end only when there is neither the seer nor the object that is to be seen nor the act of seeing.  

Bhata Bhaskar is not clear as to what Jeevan Mukti means. Perhaps he is just trying to understand it himself as to what it means.

On the other hand, in my childhood, we used to recite Acharya Abhinavgupta's "stuti" almost on a daily basis.

Here he has elaborated in a beautiful manner as to how one gets united with Shiva in the following words

त्वन्मयमेतदशेषमिदानीम् भाति मम त्वदनुग्रह शक्त्या।

त्वँ च महेश सदैव ममात्मा स्वात्म मयँ मम तेन सम्स्तम्।।

स्वात्मनि वेशि गते त्वयि नाथे तेन न सँसृति भीति कथास्ति। सत्स्वपि धुर्धर दुःख विमोह त्रास विधायिशु कर्म गणेषु!

अन्तक माम् प्रति मा दृश्यमेनाम् क्रोध करालतमाँ विधधीहि।

शँकर सेवन चिन्तन धीरो भीषण भैरव शक्ति मयोस्मि।।

Thus when one gets united with Shiva, it is immaterial as to whether we call it mukti or whatever.

And if Shiva is Saguna, then the Jiva that united with Him is also Saguna otherwise both are nirguna!

Perhaps Bhaskara was striving to resolve this dichotomy himself as to whether Shiva (I.e. Brahman) was saguna or nirguna!

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!

A K Kaul
