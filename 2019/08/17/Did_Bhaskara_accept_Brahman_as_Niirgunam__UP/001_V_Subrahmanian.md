Thanks Sri Kaul for the document on Bhaskara. It makes very interesting reading. I did not find a mention of the state of the jiva in moksha.
He no doubt admits Brahman to be saguna with all auspicious attributes. And jiva as Brahman alone in upadhis. He is also known not to admit jivanmukti. So, what would be the state of the jiva, upon realization of his state of being Brahman?  is there svarupa naasha of the jiva? Is moksha a place / abode of Brahman?

  

warm regards
