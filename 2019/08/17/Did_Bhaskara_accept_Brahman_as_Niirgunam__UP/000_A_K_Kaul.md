Dear Sirs,

Jai Shri Ram!

I have been able to retrieve from my archives the attachment "Gitasamiksha" by T K Gopalaswamy Aiyengar about the commentary of Bhaskara on the Gita.

I have the original commentary by Bhaskara apart from Abhinavagupta etc. also somewhere but because of some problem with the computer for quite sometime, I am unable to locate the same right now.

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!

A K Kaul
