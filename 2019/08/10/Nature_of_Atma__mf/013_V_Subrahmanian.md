I recall an observation by Shankaracharya in the Brahmasutra Bhashya 2.1.14:तथा अकारादिसत्याक्षरप्रतिपत्तिर्दृष्टारेखानृताक्षरप्रतिपत्तेः । \[ A letter, a sign, drawn in a certain shape is only a representation of the sound. The former is not static; it has many versions, across many cultures, but the latter, sound, is common.\]
