Sure, I agree with you. It is just that the last sentence of your note, viz., "We could perhaps embolden ourselves to extrapolate and say that what enumeration is in this pair of sentences, Brahman is in the realm of Human Thought." led me to believe that perhaps you are asserting that Brahman could be brought within the ambit of the mind and words.

  

Words as like the women in the parables of Panchatantra and Hitopadesa - they are something, they mean something, they imply something else, while someone takes them to be something else altogether.
