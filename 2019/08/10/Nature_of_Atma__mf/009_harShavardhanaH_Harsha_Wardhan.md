Sri Murthy garu, interesting example of sentences. But the conclusion derived from the example of those self-referential sentences, viz., that Brahman is a mental construct and that defining Brahman (accurate description/labeling, that is) is within the realm of human thought, is not convincing to me.  
  

The idea that is emerging from the note is that of self-reference and self-reflexivenes, and here, the work of Alfred Korzybski is perhaps relevant. We have heard this quote of his: A map is not the territory it represents, but, if correct, it has a similar structure to the territory, which accounts for its usefulness. (Korzybski, Science and Sanity). Put differently, the description of the thing is not the thing itself. The model is not the reality. The abstraction is not the abstracted. Please note, by “map” is meant any abstraction of reality, such as frameworks, descriptions, theories, models, etc. The current name for this is "mental model", something popularized by Charlie Munger, Warren Buffett's partner, and Nassim Nichoas Taleb.  
  
Farnam Street elaborates the whole point nicely: (hence quoting in toto, with small modifications)  
  
Per Korzybski:  

1.  A map may have a structure similar or dissimilar to the structure of
    the territory. 2.  Two similar structures have similar ‘logical’ characteristics. Thus,
    if in a correct map, Dresden is given as between Paris and Warsaw, a
    similar relation is found in the actual territory. 3.  A map is not the actual territory. 4.  An ideal map would contain the map of the map, the map of the map of
    the map, etc., endlessly… (self-reflexiveness)

Maps are necessary for our understanding, but flawed nonetheless. The problem with a map is not simply that it is an abstraction; we need abstraction. A map with the scale of one mile to one mile would not have the problems that maps have, nor would it be helpful in any way.  
  
The mind creates maps of reality in order to understand it (reality), because the only way we can process the complexity of reality is through abstraction. But frequently, we don’t understand our maps or their limits. In fact, we are so reliant on abstraction that we will frequently use an incorrect model simply because we feel any model is preferable to no model.  
  
Even the best and most useful maps suffer from limitations, per Korzybski:  

1.  The map could be incorrect without us realizing it; 2.  The map is, by necessity, a reduction of the actual thing, a process
    in which you lose certain important information; and  
3.  A map needs interpretation, a process that can cause major errors.
    (The only way to truly solve the last would be an endless chain of
    maps-of-maps, which he called self-reflexiveness.)  

There’s another issue: the human brain takes great leaps and shortcuts in order to make sense of its surroundings. We can call it the heuristic tendency of the human mind. For many people, the model creates its own reality. It is as if the spreadsheet comes to life. We forget that reality is a lot messier. The map isn’t the territory. The theory isn’t what it describes; it’s simply a way we choose to interpret a certain set of information. Maps can also be wrong, but even if they are essentially correct, they are an abstraction, and abstraction means that information is lost to save space.  
  
The first step is to realize that one does not understand a model, map, or reduction unless one understands and respect its limitations.  
  
Essentially, the point present in the Upanishads - that Brahman is where speech, mind fail - is correct.  
  
Only a map of Brahman is possible. That is the best we can do here.  
  
The map of Brahman we have drawn is not Brahman itself.  
  
kind regards  
Harsha
