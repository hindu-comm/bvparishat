Jagrat, Swapna and Susupti avasthas are matters of common experience, directly perceivable. The pramana here is Pratyaksham. You don't need someone else to tell you that you are awake, were sleeping or were dreaming. You know them of yourself by yourself.

  

Turiya avastha is a deeply personal, internal experience; hence external pramanas are not possible prima facie. However, recently Matthieu Ricard and several others have done electroencephalogram (EEG) and other studies on meditating Tibetian yogis under controlled lab conditions and have found significant indicators of altered mental states. You can google further and learn more on this.

  

Additional pramana and explanation come from the statement of Swami Vivekananda, when he said the following:  

  

"...There is a still higher plane upon which the mind can work. It can go beyond consciousness. Just as unconscious work is beneath consciousness, so there is another work which is above consciousness, and which also is not accompanied with the feeling of egoism. The feeling of egoism is only on the middle plane. When the mind is above or below that line, there is no feeling of "I", and yet the mind works. When the mind goes beyond this line of self-consciousness, it is called Samâdhi or superconsciousness. How, for instance, do we know that a man in Samadhi has not gone below consciousness, has not degenerated instead of going higher? In both cases the works are unaccompanied with egoism. The answer is, by the effects, by the results of the work, we know that which is below, and that which is above. When a man goes into deep sleep, he enters a plane beneath consciousness. He works the body all the time, he breathes, he moves the body, perhaps, in his sleep, without any accompanying feeling of ego; he is unconscious, and when he returns from his sleep, he is the same man who went into it. The sum total of the knowledge which he had before he went into the sleep remains the same; it does not increase at all. No enlightenment comes. But when a man goes into Samadhi, if he goes into it a fool, he comes out a sage. What makes the difference? From one state a man comes out the very same man that he went in, and from another state the man comes out enlightened, a sage, a prophet, a saint, his whole character changed, his life changed, illumined. These are the two effects. Now the effects being different, the causes must be different. As this illumination with which a man comes back from Samadhi is much higher than can be got from unconsciousness, or much higher than can be got by reasoning in a conscious state, it must, therefore, be superconsciousness, and Samadhi is called the superconscious state..."

  

The pramanas here are anumana (inference/reasoning) and upamana (comparison/analogy)

  

But the ultimate authority is the word of our rishis and sages, the pramana of sabda. This includes all the srutis (and for me personally, smritis as well). The technical manuals like Patanjali Yoga Sutras, and other ancient texts also come under this category (for me personally, for others the pramana could be anumana, inference or reasoning)
