Dear Harsha Wardhan-Jim

  

Namaste.

  

Thank you for your detailed reply. May I request you to write in your own way what you know about self or at at atma.

I think of atma is different than my senses and body. It is some entity that is with me. It guides me and some times. In a way it is me. Not sure what will happen to it when I die. I will never know. What is very interesting is the susupti and Turiya stages of sleep.

I am not sure if experiments have done to find that ‘atma’ is outside of the body?

It is said that Adi Shankaracharya left his body. Was that his Atma?

Has similar events noted down. I know there were Rishis who have power to turn human beings into inert objects and later brought back to life. Was Atma taken away? Or it was some thing else.

Obviously these incidents may be poetic imagination.

In any way it is important that post upanishdic activities be resumed. May be there are divine jivatmas who are continuing their quest.

I am simply wishing that original research be carried out with definite goals and objectives and hypothesis that is based on current understanding.

The deliberations and discussions that is going on this forum is very encouraging.

Because of the virtual nature of the posts they can be easily overlooked and ignored.

Best regards

Deva
