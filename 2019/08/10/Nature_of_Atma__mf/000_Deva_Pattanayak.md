Atma is inside ones body. Atma is everywhere.  
From a classical perspective then Atma is discrete and not continuous yet limitless.  
From quantum theory perspective Atma can be described as a wave function or a field with probability of being inside the bodies as well as outside the bodies. Only when one knows it is within the body then it has a probability of one that it is certain that it is inside the body some where as in the classical concept.  
During the susupti stage of sleep and in the turiya stage of sleep according to the quantum theory the probability that Atma is outside the body increases very close to one.  
There can not be any real difference between body and Atma because that will lead to the need of some other element and so on.  
So from a quantum theory perspective Atma is essentially the quantum vacuum Which is not empty or inert. It pervades all space for all time and changes its state manifesting living beings as well as the bodies which can be considered as concentrated energies. Creation, preservation and destruction are carried out by operators which act upon the vacuum state.  
The above is not in contradiction with Vedic ideas. However, not being a scholar of Vedas I find it difficult to write in laymanâ€™s term a theory of creation, preservation and destruction. But am trying and hope to do that.  
Please feel free to write in your own words what you think is the way the world is created and managed.
