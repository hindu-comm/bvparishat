\> Hence helplessly we have to accept the 'ajAti vAda'. A study of the  
\> 'MAndUkya Upanishad' and 'kArika' by Shree GaudapAdaAcharya and its  
\> 'Bhashyam' by his grand disciple, Shree Adi Shankaracharya will be helpful.  
  

Furthermore, the anonymous author of the Kashmirian Mokṣopāya  
(commonly known as "Yogavāsiṣṭha") propounds a philosophical ajātivāda.

"ABSTRACT. This paper addresses the issue of how science and history  
of science may help or be helped by Vedic studies. The conclusions  
drawn are that: 1. Vedic studies are important for the history of  
Indian science; 2. Modern science, in particular physics, is not a  
useful source of philosophical ideas that confirm aspects of Vedic  
studies; 3. Vedic studies will not contribute to modern scientific  
research; and 4. Vedic studies are nevertheless centrally important  
for an understanding of Indian history and culture in general."
