Thank you.

Assuming that my atma is within or around me, I closed my eyes and started searching for it. Gradually becoming still and slowly loosing my awareness. I woke up before coming face to face.

Then I realized that may be every night I meet with my atma but forget our conversations. May be those private discussions are meant to remain so for eternity.

Best Regards

Deva

Ps:  But I like to know the nature of my atma that is so invincible as mentioned in Gita and in upanishads. Will keep attempting. Only then can I succeed .
