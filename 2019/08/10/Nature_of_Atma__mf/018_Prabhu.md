Dear Pattanayak-Ji

Very interesting topic for me, thanks!

  

Just thought of adding that there is no unanimity regarding the parimANa of AtmA.

  

I am unable to get a hold of the references in the prasthAna-s and/or commentary for the aNu parimANatva of the AtmA.

I have heard of the AtmA as being of the size of "1/100 th of a 1/100 th of the tip of a horse's tail"

... arthAt "aNu" pariNAma.

  

Just FWIW, the following is from the "Encyclopedia of the Hindu World" - Dr Ganga Ram Garg.

  

  

In case unable to see the bitmap above:  

  dvaita and viSiShTAdvaita : aNu-parimANa

  advaita and sAnkhya     : vibhu-parimANa

  jaina                  : madhyama-parimANa

  bauddha               : anAtmA

  

Regards
