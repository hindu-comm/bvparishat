Quoting from

T.K. Gopalaswamy Aiyangar, " Bhaskara on the Gita"

  

Bhaskar concludes that the jivas related to Isvara as his fragments(Isvaramsah) are differently conditioned in different bodies with varying experiences of pleasure and pain. On the basis of the example of ether, he further states that just as ether in the jar though smoky or dusty will not contaminate the ether in other jars, the experiences of jivas in several bodies will not affect in any way the individual experiences of other jivas in other bodies. Bhaskara supplements his discussion to establish the atomic and monadic nature of the jivas by citing the upanishadic authority which testifies to the ingress and egress of the subtle body or linga sarira of the jivas from and into several bodies. He holds that the atomicity of the jiva is the outcome of the conditionality of the absolute and that the linga sarira is subjected to expansion and contraction.

  

If one carefully try to understand what is said here one can not but conclude that while jivas are bounded to the body, it can expand and contract and move out of the body. These are in conformity with the axioms of quantum theory.

Bhaskara did not quite say that Jivas are limitless. It is said that Bhaskara concludes that "jivas are neither absolutely different nor absolutely identical with God".

This again reminds me of quantum theory according to which the particle is neither here nor there.

Careful reading and understanding of books and manuscripts by Bharatiya Vidvans will lead to a better understanding of nature of atma which resides in all of us. As such we can know what it is!

  

I will be grateful if somebody can post the sanskrit version of "Bhasya by Bhaskara" treatise.
