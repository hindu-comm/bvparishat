Sir, just a small input: Turiya is not a stage of sleep, it is a stage beyond sleep, the fourth stage after waking, dreaming and sleeping. Only susupti is in respect of sleep (stage of deep dreamless sleep), and that's it.

In Kashmir Shaivism there exists a fifth state of consciousness called Turiyatita - the state beyond Turiya. Also called shunya, it is the state where one attains liberation.
