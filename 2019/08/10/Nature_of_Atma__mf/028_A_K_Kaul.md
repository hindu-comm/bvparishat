Dear Dr. Pattanayak,

Jai Shri Ram!

I had a pdf copy of Bhata Baskara's commentary from Satisar Foundation.
But they have removed it from there nor can I find the pdf copy in my archives.

Bhaskar did not appear to me a "self-realized" soul unlike the Adi Shankara though he has explained the nuances in an elaborate manner.

Bhaskar seemed to be more interested in proving the Aadi Shankara wrong than arriving at the truth.

Acharya Abhinav Gupta's commentary is more revealing on the other hand.

IMHO, whether we call it anirvachaniya or whatever, the Aadi Shankara wins hands down though he advocates the Upanishadic extreme of "यदहरेव विरजेत् तदहरेव प्रव्रजेत्".

About the Jiva moving in and out of body, it is a fact which has been elaborated in the Gita at several places.

Regarding Quantum Theory vis-a-vis the "Nature of Atma" I will revert to it shortly.

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!

A K Kaul

PS

Since Gopalaswamy Aiyangar says Bhaskara's commentary on the Gita was published by BHU, I think it is worthwhile to enquire about its availability from there.

AKK
