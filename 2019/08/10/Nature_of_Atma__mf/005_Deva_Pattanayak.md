Dear Murthy-ji

Now that you know the concept of Brahman, how do you think Brahma created the universe? One can assume Brahma to have used the creation operator to create whatever he wished for knowing a priori that what he is about to recreate existed before in the but unexpressed.

The creation of something non-existent is beyond the capability of even Brahma. Jagat is is considered to be "Mithya" (asat) because it can be destroyed and created back again. There is also the concept of tapas which Brahma uses to create the objects. Where did he get tapas from?

  

Being a part of this Jagat which is ever changing and impermanent, may be we do not concern ourselves of filling in the blanks in the sentences designed to turn out to be always asat or mithya.

Instead, we turn our mind inward and help some trillions of cells working incessantly inside our body to keep us healthier and in blissful state of mind. For this purpose we may use concepts from the Vedas and Upanishads in our current scientific research to build a better society. In another thread I am advocating that Sanskrit be a required language before Ph.D. is granted. That way students engaged in cutting edge research will widen their background knowledge.

Best Regards

Deva
