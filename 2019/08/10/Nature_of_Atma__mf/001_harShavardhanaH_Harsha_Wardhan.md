Is what you are saying related to the idea of collapse of the wave function when there is an observer?

  

The idea of self as non-involving observer, and the universe as dependent on the presence of the observer is there since very ancient times in many streams of Indian thought -

  

1\. Samkhya - Chit or consciousness as drashta or observer only (tantra derives from and develops this)

  

2\. Bhagavad Gita - Atma or consciousness as Ksetrajna or knower of the field (ksetra)

  

3\. Yoga - Chit or consciousness as sakshin or witness of prakrti (Note - Samkhya and Yoga are one, not two)

  

4\. Yogachara - the doctrine of Vijñapti-mātra (simplistically, mind generates its own reality) in Buddhism

  

5\. Trika saivism (Tantra of Kashmir): Chaitanyam Atma Jnanam Bandhah - consciousness is self, knowledge (perception) is bondage - cf. Sivasutra

  

6\. Also, Spanda (doctrine of vibration) from Kashmir - the spandakarika

  

7\. There is a lot of material on Vedanta and Quantum Theory. For ex,<https://www.scienceandnonduality.com/>and many more. There are several books on Amazon that talk of the double slit experiment and many more aspects of physics - a simple search and a cursory glance at their reviews will give an idea to you

  

Pls note, my knowledge is limited on Vedanta darshana. There are other knowledgeable seniors on this list who can speak authoritatively on Vedanta.
