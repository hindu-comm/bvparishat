Many thanks Hrashavardhanji for having taken the trouble of going through my note and commenting.

I fully agree that Map is not the territory. I do not think my note could be misunderstood to convey that. My note ends as follows; "The way Vedantins have tried to define Brahman has thus an **analogue** in the above sentences, which are well within the realm of logic. We could perhaps embolden ourselves to extrapolate and say that what enumeration is in this pair of sentences, Brahman is in the realm of Human Thought." It is no more than an analogy. All of science is an exercise in creating models which try to represent reality as much as possible, as simply as possible and perhaps as beautifully as possible.

Thanks and regards

Murthy
