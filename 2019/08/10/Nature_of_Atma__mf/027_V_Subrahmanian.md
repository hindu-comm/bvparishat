The verse Bhaskaa cites for the above is there is the Gaudapada's karika 3.5 for the Mandukya Upanishad:

  

यथैकस्मिन्घटाकाशे रजोधूमादिभिर्युते।  
न सर्वे सम्प्रयुज्यन्ते तद्वज्जीवाः सुखादिभिः ॥ ५ ॥

I think since Bhaskara holds the jiva to be Brahman in the final analysis, the nature of the jiva is vibhu, all-pervading, and not aNu.

In the Brahma sutra bhashya of Shankara 2.1.14, a view of a bhedaabheda vaadin is stated and refuted: the view is: difference from Brahman during bondage due to ignorance is real and non-difference with Brahman due to knowledge in liberation is also real.
