Dear Mr. Pattanayak, Mr. Murthy and Mr. Wardhan,

  

As I begin my journey in understanding the way, this particular thread resonates very much. I recently collected my nascent thoughts as regards this space in a little personal write-up; a bit of writing where I attempted to clarify some of these thoughts to myself. I am sharing this here. Again, I am a rank beginner and I am learning, but this particular thread with references to Hamiltonians, Godel's incompleteness theorems and the underlying quantum mechanics is deeply satisfying. I remain thankful for all of the teaching I obtain through this august set of gurus. - Respectfully, Sunil.

  

  

# Ekam Tat Sarvam (The One that is All) --- Sunil Nair



It may sound strange to the average ear when I utter, “The One that is All,” but the phrase ‘Ekam Tat Sarvam’ is the ultimate truth. In order to understand and unpack the meaning behind the phrase and to lend credence to that strong opening line, an oft-visited place that our teachers frequent is within the writings of an illustrious South Indian seer named ShankaraÄcärya. Circa 700 CE, ShankaraÄcärya clarified the principles of Brahman, Atman and like concepts in a clear lucid manner such that you and I can follow through on the timeless philosophy underlying the Vedas and in turn, Vedänta. With that, I felt that the following sloka of ShankaraÄcärya is as good a starting point as any amongst his copious Vedäntic writings:



ब्रह्मसत्यंजगन्मिथ्याजीवोब्रह्मैवनापरः।

Brahma Satyam JaganmithyA JIvo Brahmaiva Naparah।

अनेनवेद्यंसच्छास्त्रमितिवेदान्तडिण्डिमः॥२०॥

Anena Vedyam SacchAstram Iti VedAntaDiNDimah॥२०॥



Brahman alone is real; the world is non-real; and the individual self is essentially not different from Brahman.।This should be understood as the correct sastra. This is proclaimed by Vedanta.॥२०॥



By way of definitions, the word*Brahman*itself is a neuter noun that comes from the Samskrita root-prefix ‘bṛh’ - "to swell, expand, grow, enlarge" and the suffix ‘man’. The suffix signifies the absence of any constraints (in expanse) whatsoever when attached to the prefix. Thus the provenance of the word ‘Brahman’ indicates “that which is incomprehensibly and pervasively omnipresent”. It is said that a deep study of Vedanta reveals to one that that there is only one reality and one truth: the manifestation of Brahman is that one supreme reality. A reality that is variously described as infinitely all-pervasive, sans form, gender or mutability; a reality which is the material, formal and final causation of all that exists.



Now that we have definitions out of the way, let us go back to the first line in the sloka that captures a certain core aspect of what we must know:ब्रह्मसत्यं(brahma satyam - brahman alone is real)जगन्मिथ्या(jaganmithya - the world is non-real)जीवोब्रह्मैवनापरः(jivo brahmaiva naparah - the individual self is essentially not different from brahman).



Here is the inherent essence behind these words as I see it:



**brahma satyam**: while some may take umbrage with the words 'brahman alone is real', one can substitute the word Brahman to take the place of their own manifestation of an ultimate entity of some sort. For the religious who insist on focus towards singular objects of divinity and contemplation, this entity can take the form of 'god' or 'deity' or any of the innumerable other empirical materializations that we fashion within our minds for the sake of explanations for That Aspect which might essentially be difficult to explain and express. For the physicist, it might be the singularity at the center of a black hole, for the mathematician, it might be exact solutions to the Navier Stokes, for the pantheist, it is the immanent nature of all manifest things and so on and so forth it goes. Some understand it as the consciousness that results from the merging of the individual parts of ourselves with the whole that pervades the cosmos is one way to approach this statement. If one wants to approach the concept of Brahman from a purely scientific perspective, the following example is in order: Physics seems to posit today that what the ancients referred to as the ‘Brahman’ correlates directly to the manifestation of the fact that there is the detection of discernable energy even within regions of empty space devoid of any particles. Let’s say, you are talking about a photon – an article of light – physics tells us that what you really are experiencing and observing as the photon is the excitation of an inherent field – the electromagnetic field in the case of a photon. Now say if you have no photons, that means there are no excitations, but physics tells us that the empty space is still pervaded by an inherent energy field. This is the same manifestation that we notice with any other particle, electrons or protons or quarks or whatever. Those particles are simply manifestations that result from the excitations of fields in space in response to changes in energy levels. Physics is clear that once you take away the particles, the field remains. Physicists are starting to realize that there is no reason to think that the energy per unit volume (the density of energy in the fields), is zero. Thus, even if you take away the particles, the energy of free space is now colloquially referred to as vacuum energy. The description of Brahman posited in the age-old Vedanta closely approximates the findings of physicists today with respect to vacuum energy. Different religions, cultures and disciplines give this phenomenon different names, but fundamentally they all refer to the same state of being.



**jaganmithya**: while the direct translation can read something like "the world is non-real" and could potentially elicit confusion on the part of the person who hears thus, the truth (after much thinking and analysis on my part) is as follows: this line informs in a compendiary manner the fundamental non-discoverability of a sovereign essence of any manifest entity in this universe. This entails that, in an explicit sense, there is no evidence of an ultimate reality. Ultimate reality, or its karmic variations posited across various approaches to understanding reality is neither vital spark, nor is formed from an indivisible moiety of atoms, nor our consciousness, nor our souls, nor any purported spirit. Ultimate reality in any shape, form or perception does not exist. This might come as a shock to some, but one need to look no further than the nature of reality that spills forth from either Einstein's equations or Penrose's abstractions. The reality is much more startling than your standard undergraduate truisms - those truisms that obsessively dictate that everything is subjective to individual points of view. The solutions that flow forth from the relativity equations show that there really is no flow or a passage of time, there is no past nor a future, there is no direction as it were postulated in the definition of time. The key finding is that the temporal component of the space time continuum is in complete concordance with its spatial counterparts. Physical time is as still as physical space - as eloquently laid out in that last scene in the movie Interstellar. The inescapable conclusion that one draws from this is that all truths - whether inherently existent or temporally manifested are basically fabricated - a meticulous albeit diaphanous fabric that is constructed out of our shared experiences built over time both from nature as well as nurture (the ways of our culture as well as the code within our genes). Thus, the word Jagat combines within itself all of what we see and experience within this world, this cosmos. Material objects such trees, chairs etc. (what one would quantify as 'gross-objects' in general) and immaterial phenomena like thoughts, emotions and their connotations thereof all are embodied within Jagat. The cycles within Jagat are a dynamic flux of transients that include revival, resurgence, decay and destruction ad infinitum. Our experiences of both the immaterial and the material are conflated within these transient cycles. Following these cyclic routines, phenomena within Jagat conventionally manifest themselves in a dependent manner, abide in a dependent manner and then cease to be conventionally manifest again in a dependent manner. Given that the arising of phenomena, the abiding of the same and the eventual cessation are all empty of any inherent existence or intrinsic essence, we start to understand that the web of all manifest interactions, discrete or otherwise are abstractions of reality that we build within ourselves to navigate the exigencies of our existence. This is perfectly captured by employing a chimeric metaphor like Mithya which roughly translates to 'false belief'. A better way to describe mithya is as follows – a false impression that one gains of worldly life which cannot be demolished without rigorous practice.



**jivo brahmaiva naparah**: I aver that this is the most profound and the simplest part of this verse. The translation is exactly what it is: "individual self is essentially not different from brahman". Every atom, combined using the power of fundamental forces into molecules, aggregated into ever more complex and complete structures emanated from a single place - the big bang. Atoms of hydrogen in our bodies existed since the time of creation, everything from hydrogen to the element iron (an essential component of the hemoglobin that courses within our blood vessels) were forged in the heart of stars and all elements whose atomic numbers were higher than iron were created in fiery showers of neutrons ejected at speeds close to the velocity of light from exploding supernovae that then turned into neutron stars. To think that everything from the precious metal gold that some of us opt to wear as ornaments to the iron within red blood cells to the hydrogen atom within the molecules of water we imbibe to every atom within the makeup of our corporeal bodies were and are a part of cosmos is indeed the meaning of this line. Thus, one can say that ‘jiva’ – the apparently circumscribed entity we call our lives – is nothing but the infinite and limitless Brahman and nothing else. So, when the verse says that the individual self is nothing but manifestations of ultimate entities, it is another form of saying that 'that art thou' or tat tvam asi.
