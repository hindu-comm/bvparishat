Dear Wardhan-ji

In quantum theory a system, say our body is described in terms of a wave function and an operator which is called the Hamiltonian. The Hamiltonian operating on the wave function leads to its dynamical behavior. An important assumption or axiom is that the wave function is complex meaning it has a real part and an imaginary part. The language used in quantum theory is abstract and mathematical. An imaginary number is the square root of a negative number. 

The Hamiltonian operator is expressed in terms of three basic operators, the creation, destruction and the preservation operators. This corresponds unambiguously to the Vedic concepts if Brahma, Shiva and Vishnu respectively.

Because of this fundamental similarity, I strongly believe further advance in our knowledge may benefit by understanding Vedas. For that a knowledge of Sanskrit is necessary. That is the reason why every Ph.D. Student of science must be required to know Sanskrit language.

Similarly an awareness of modern science and technology will benefit yogis and munis.

The emphasis must be to advance the state of our knowledge.

Hope this clarifies my quest in understanding what we call Atma.  

Best regards

Deva
