Dear list,  
  
I’ve just had a meeting with a colleague, and it looks like my workload will increase shortly, and I won’t have time to read as much of BVP as I’d like. I’ll definitely retain the Krishna verses thread, since that’s why I signed up to BVP to begin with, but the rest will have to be minimised.  
If you have book or paper titles you think I might be able to locate, please post your requests in this thread IN ADDITION to sending a private message. The thread will be a kind of backup so people don’t feel ignored in case the private message doesn’t come through for some reason. Naturally, if you’d prefer to just send a private message, please do what works best for you.  
  
Best wishes,  
Irene
