I have deep interest in chitrakavitva, particularly in Telugu. In this pursuit I collected lot of books and articles from various sources and in severallanguages.

  

Coming to a point made by SrI Nagaraj Paturi, bandha kavitva is present in other languages too. Somehow, garbha kavutva seems to be practiced most in Telugu than in any other language. I have not come across garbha kavitva in other languages. In a way, it is possible in Tamil as their viruttams are basically what we call jAti. In that sense several Sanskrit metres can be embedded in their viruttams. For example mattakOkila (mallika in Kannada and Malayalam and charchari in sanskrit) is present in tEvAram! A Tamil-Sanskrit scholar, I forget his name, has done some work and also recorded some audios in this regard. I tried to give a few varieties of other metres in tamil veNbA. But in Telugu, the possibilities have been endless. In fact, gaNapavarapu vEnkaTakavi's SrI prabandharAja vEnkaTESvara vijayavilAsamu is considered to be an encyclopedia in chitrakavitva. I wrote some computer algorithms too in this regard.
