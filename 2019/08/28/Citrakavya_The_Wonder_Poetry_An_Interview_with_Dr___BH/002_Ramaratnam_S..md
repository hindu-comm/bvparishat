Yes there a number of Citrakavyas and Chitra-Chatuslokas in Tamil also. There was one Kalamegha Pulavar who was an expert in that. A Chennai based gentleman has written a book on Sanskrit Chitrakavyas and it was published by Motilal Banarsidas. I had the pleasure of helping him. He has acknowledged it in the first line of the preface in his book.
