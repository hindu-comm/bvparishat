Very interesting article indeed.

I just met with a Ph.D. student from Switzerland on his last day at MIT in the elevator. I asked what is he doing. He told me doing research in artificial intelligence and was visiting MIT. We talked briefly. What interested me is his statement " we know how to hide infinity".

when I told him that in understanding the nature of infinity will open up doors to AI.

What has impressed me always is " Brahmanda mala mala hoee to loma mule birajaee" in the Biswaroopa darshana chapter of Gita.

May be the gentleman has something very important.

What is needed for scholars in India to use the old and new concepts, the modern science and the vedas and the shastras, to go beyond the uapanishads.
