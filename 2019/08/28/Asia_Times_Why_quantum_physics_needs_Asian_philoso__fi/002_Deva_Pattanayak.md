I thought of posting this quotation of Swami Vivekananda. In science and technology, the emphasis is discovering new things and not understanding the old and propagating the known knowledge in many different ways.

A pandit is one whose discoveries are quoted and used to advance knowledge in every field. These days one can simply google to find out contributions by any one living or dead.
