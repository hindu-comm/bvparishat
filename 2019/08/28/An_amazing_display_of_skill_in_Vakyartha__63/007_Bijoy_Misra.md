I do have a question for people who are into the Shastra.

I would like to know the first use of the two words आरोपित and वास्तव in Indian literature.

Most of our discussion and such in the west is आरोपित, a rough translation would be "by superposition."

It is perception vs cognition in scientific terms.  

Cognition as a phenomenon is only understood through yoga literature.
The west confuses it with recognition which is memory driven.

  

Please help to dig a little history of science.

  

Best regards,

BM
