Subbuji,

  

I have been watching this video for the past 2 days continuously and am spell bound by the boy's tejas on his face...

  

This brilliance, eloquence, knowledge and tejas comes thru gayatri upaasana and agni kaarya.

  

It needs guts to speak on tarka shastra before the giants present there like Gopalakrishna Sastry Garu, Devadatta Patil Garu, Mani Sastrigal, Sripada Subramanya Sastry Garu.

  

Hail to our sanatana dharma and lots & lots of good wishes to the young brahmachari ....

  

rgs,

sriram
