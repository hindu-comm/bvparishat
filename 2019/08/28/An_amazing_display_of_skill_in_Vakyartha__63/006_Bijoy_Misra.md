I loved watching it. To nail an argument through the concepts has been the basis of modern Physics.

People might like to visit Principia of Newton to get a feel of self-doubt.

The system of verbalization and direct debate is possibly of Indian origin though Socrates is known

to have engaged people in debates.

  

I congratulate the Indic Academy for organizing and exposing us to this brilliant tradition

of respectful debating in search of knowledge and scientific truth. Let me also draw everybody's

attention to the implications of words आरोपित and वास्तव in our discussion here in BVP.

  

Best regards,
