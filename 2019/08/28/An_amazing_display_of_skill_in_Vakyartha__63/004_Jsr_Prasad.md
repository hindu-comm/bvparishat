Thanks Subramanian ji, for sharing this information. This young lad has a promising future, He answered very wisely some questions like असत्त्वाभावः सत्त्वमिति कथं ज्ञायते? Congratulations to Prof. Paturi ji and Indic Academy for consolidating all such young talent by bringing them to an international platform in preserving the Sastic rigour.

  

Prostrations to all Gurus!
