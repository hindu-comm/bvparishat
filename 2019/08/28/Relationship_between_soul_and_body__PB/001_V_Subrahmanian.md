According to Advaita Vedanta the relationship is 'aadhyasika sambandha'. For the Bh.Gita verse 13.26 where the word 'samyoga' is present, Shankaracharya explains:

  

यावत्सञ्जायतेकिञ्चित्सत्त्वंस्थावरजङ्गमम्।  
क्षेत्रक्षेत्रज्ञसंयोगात्तद्विद्धिभरतर्षभ॥ २६ ॥

यावत्यत्किञ्चित्सञ्जायतेसमुत्पद्यतेसत्त्वंवस्तु;किम्अविशेषेण?नेत्याह—स्थावरजङ्गमंस्थावरंजङ्गमंचक्षेत्रक्षेत्रज्ञसंयोगात्तत्जायतेइत्येवंविद्धिजानीहिभरतर्षभ॥

कःपुनःअयंक्षेत्रक्षेत्रज्ञयोःसंयोगःअभिप्रेतः?नतावत्रज्ज्वेवघटस्यअवयवसंश्लेषद्वारकःसम्बन्धविशेषःसंयोगःक्षेत्रेणक्षेत्रज्ञस्यसम्भवति,आकाशवत्निरवयवत्वात्।नापिसमवायलक्षणःतन्तुपटयोरिवक्षेत्रक्षेत्रज्ञयोःइतरेतरकार्यकारणभावानभ्युपगमात्इति,उच्यते—क्षेत्रक्षेत्रज्ञयोःविषयविषयिणोःभिन्नस्वभावयोःइतरेतरतद्धर्माध्यासलक्षणःसंयोगःक्षेत्रक्षेत्रज्ञस्वरूपविवेकाभावनिबन्धनः,रज्जुशुक्तिकादीनांतद्विवेकज्ञानाभावात्अध्यारोपितसर्परजतादिसंयोगवत्।सःअयंअध्यासस्वरूपःक्षेत्रक्षेत्रज्ञसंयोगःमिथ्याज्ञानलक्षणः।

  

**English Translation Of Sri Shankaracharya's Sanskrit Commentary By Swami Gambirananda**

13.27 Bharatarsabha, O scion of the Bharata dynasty; yavat kincit, whatever; sattvam, object;-as to whether they are without exception the Lord says-sthavara-jangamam, moving or non-moving; sanjayate, comes into being; viddhi, know; tat, that; as originating ksetra-ksetrajna-samyogat, from the association of the field and the Knower of the field. Objection: What, again, is meant by this 'association of the field and the Knower of the field'? Since the Knower of the field is partless like space, therefore Its conjunction with the field cannot be a kind of relationship like coming together of a rope and a pot through the contact of their parts. Nor can it be an intimate and inseparable relation as between a thread and a cloth, since it is not admitted that the field and the Knower of the field are mutually related by way of being cause and effect. Reply: The answer is: The association of the field and the Knower of the field-which are the object and the subject, respectively, and are of different natures-is in the form of superimposition of each on the other an also of their alities, as a conseence of the absence of discrimination between the real natures of the field and the Knower of the field. This is like the association of a rope, nacre, etc. with the superimposed snake, silver, etc. owing to the absence of discrimination between them. This association of the field and the Knower of the field in the form of superimposition is described as false knowledge.
