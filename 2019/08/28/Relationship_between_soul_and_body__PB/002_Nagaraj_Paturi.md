Dear Sri Sampath Kumar-ji,

  

You may get better S'aastra reference help if you rephrase your sentence avoiding the word 'soul' .

  

What did you have in mind as the meaning of the word 'soul'? If you describe, then it may become clear whether what you have in mind is aatman, sookshma s'areera or any other entity that is discussed in s'aastra.

  

Then the rellation between sthoola s'areera and that entity can be discussed as per a certain s'aastra.
