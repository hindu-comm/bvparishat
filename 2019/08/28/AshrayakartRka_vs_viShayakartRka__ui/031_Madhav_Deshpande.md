I do appreciate this theoretical discussion. However, while I have seen extensive discussions on examples like ओदन: पच्यते \[स्वयमेव\] going all the way back to Kātyāyana and coming down to Kauṇḍabhaṭṭa and Nāgeśabhaṭṭa, I do not remember coming across the example घट: पश्यति.
Can someone point to me a textual reference where this example is discussed? I have been looking into Laghumañjūṣā of Nāgeśa and Vaiyākaraṇabhūṣaṇa of Kauṇḍabhaṭṭa, but I have not seen a discussion of this example. Perhaps I am missing some sources.
