Prof.Kannan’s analysis is simply brilliant. That so much of analysis is possible in understanding certain sentences is an eye-opener to me.

I had always brushed aside these strange constructions as quirks of the language. Some specimens have withered \[ ghaTaH pashyati\] and some are still alive \[odanaH pacati\]. “Bhave prayoga” is perhaps a similar quirk of Sanskrit. There are verbs in English which can only be expressed as a causal in Sanskrit. \[shows=darshayati\]. There are certain common English nouns for which there do not appear to be suitable equivalents in Sanskrit. \[“back” in “my back is paining”=pRShThaH?\] I 

Poets of course merrily use their freedom to express their imagination. Valmiki says, “vahanta iva dRushTibhiH”. What a way of expressing! Kalidasa says “vegadhIrghIkRtaangaH”. As it is said,

“ ta eva padavinyaasaaH taa evaarthavibhUtayaH \| tathaapi kaavyaM navyaM syaat kavergrathanakaushalaat”. Even proverbs in Indian languages amply demonstrate brilliance in expression.

Thanks and regards,
