Thank you very much, Dr Murthy.

  

I must attribute my sensitisation to issues like this to  

Dr. Vineet Chaitanya during my stay at IIT-Kanpur.

It is Dr. Chaitanya who has put Linguistics in India back on track - on Indian lines.  

A quiet and dedicated worker, he has revolutionised the field of Natural Language Processing in India,

serving as a model for work across languages, not merely Indian ones.  

  

Ask any figure in the departments of linguistics in any university in India.

They would only be eager to show off their smattering of understanding of Chomsky.

They have hardly any knowledge of the glorious Indian linguistic tradition of a few thousand years!

  

(Laying waste a whole city, a glorious city at that - like Vijayanagar - hurts many.

But laying waste a huge and deep intellectual tradition is horrendous and abominable

\- thanks to the British, the Macaulay-Minutes, the Nehru Dy**nasty**.)  

  

Whereas Panini's grammatical foundation has stayed on unshaken for millennia,

numerous models of Western grammars have come and gone

\- so much so as to give rise to a proverb in the field of Linguistics:

*Do not run behind a bus, a woman, and a Transformational Grammar;*

*another one will soon follow !  
*

*  
*

I was going through some pages of *Is'vara-pratyabhijn"A-vivRti-vimarsinI,*

kindly referred to/sent by our scholarly friends. The kind of ardour and fervour they had  

for the various *s'Astra*-s (for example, even VyAkaraNa) is so well reflected in this verse at the outset  

(pasted below):  

*

What a fall we have had! And from where!!

The vast majority (even among scholars) is not even aware what they are missing.
