Here is my guess, for whatever it is worth:

The key word is *abhidhAna-s'akti-vaicitrya*.

Both the roots *las"* and *ruc* indicate desire or *abhilAs"a.*

But there is a difference:

  

The *abhilAs"a* in the case of *las"* is *As'raya-kartRka*.

The *abhilAs"a* in the case of *ruc* is *vis"aya-kartRka*.

  

Consider the sentences which convey the same idea ultimately:

  

*devadattaH modakam abhilas"ati,*  

and

*devadattAya rocate modakaH.*
