Namaste



1. All poetry and technical discussions that have appeared in this thread are highly appreciated.



2. The link below gives several extended usage and meaning of 'Ghata- pata' ( pot and cloth) debate in traditional texts ! 'Ghata' is endorsed in use also as a ' speaker - individuals name' in non-sanskrit literature, in the link below.



<https://www.wisdomlib.org/definition/ghata>



The accuracy of Samskruth term gets mixed with proximate sounding Romanized transliteration causing some effort to identify- filter the needed material !

And all this could certainly inspire more creative writing on ' ghata' followed with ' pata'.



3. To end on a humor note: another subhashita:



घटं भिद्यात् पटं छिद्यात् कुर्यात् रासभ निस्वनम् / कुर्याद्रासभरोहणम् ।

येन-केन प्रकारेण प्रसिद्ध-पुरुषो भव ॥



गुणेष्वनादरं भ्रातः पूर्णश्रीरपि मा कृथाः । सम्पूर्णोऽपि घटः कूपे गुणछेदात्पतत्यधः ॥
