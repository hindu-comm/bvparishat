This is a brilliant thread. I made 4 pages of notes and still going strong. Thank you!

  

Since Rishi Goswami asked for examples in other languages, in ordinary Russian usage the situation is as follows:

  

If you want to say that the pot broke, you can't say 'gorshok slomal', where gorshok=pot, slomal=broke, since the listener will understand that the pot broke something else and will wait for you to finish the sentence and tel; him what the por broke. But you can say 'gorshok slomalSYA', which means 'the pot broke itself'.  

However, if you want to say 'the pot looks good', you can say 'gorshok khorosho vyglyadit', just as you would with a living object.

However, there exists, both in English and Russian, the sentence 'I broke my hand', 'Ya slomal/a ruku'. It's understood that you didn't break your hand on purpose and that it just happened by accident.
