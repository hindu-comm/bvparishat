Dear Professor Kannan,t

  

  Thanks for all these beautiful examples of ghaṭa=body poems. What I had on my mind was Kabir's bhajan: घट घट में पंछी डोलता. Here is my next Krishna verse using a related concept:

  

कुम्भकारोऽद्वितीयोऽसि तुष्टो निर्माय सर्वदा ।  
निर्वेतन: स्वलीलार्थं कुम्भानस्मादृशान् मुधा ।।८४९।।  
  
"You are a unique potter who is always happy to make pots like us for his own play without any payment."  

  

With best wishes,

  

Madhav M. Deshpande
