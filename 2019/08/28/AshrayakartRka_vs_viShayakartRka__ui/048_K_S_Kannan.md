To resume from where I left off.

  

I did not know about the nice and actual attestation from Abhinavagupta's work  

of the peculiar expression of *ghaTah pas'yati.*

Thanks to Prof. Isaacson for drawing attention to this.

Here is the case of an experience of the *mAtR, mAna,* and *meya* - all seen as one,

and any one of these being spoken of as the *kartR* being equally valid.

  

Such expressions can issue  

\- from the great experience of the essential unity of everything

 such as *vAsudeaH sarvam* (BG(=*bhagavadgItA)*7.19 )

\- from the realisation of how the One is the many,  

 - as an assertion issuing from the Lord,  

 as in BG9.16 *aham kratur aham yajn"aH* etc.

 - or as a model of value to the yogic aspirant,

 as in BG 4.24 *brahmArpaNam brahma haviH* etc.  

 (already anticipated in the opening Vedic verse  

 where agni is the all in the *yajn"a* : the purohita, deva, the Rtvij etc.)  

\- from the philosophical perception that what is outside is a projection of what is within,  

 viz. the inner faculty : a concept famous as figuring in Buddhistic idealism,

 but equally well in *vyAkaraNa-dars'ana* itself - as in *vAkyapadIya* 3.7.41

 *dyauH ks"amA vAyur Adityas sAgarAs sarito dis'aH/*

* antaHkaraNa-tattvasya bhAgA bahir-avasthitAH //*

  

When speaking from special/exalted states, it is possible to identify one with the other,  

a mystical experience as it were. This kind of "worldly" transaction can occur  

in a state of absolute surrender when one relinquishes doership too:

*sva-s'es"a-bhUtena mayA svIyais sarva-paricchadaiH/*

*vidhAtum prItam AtmAnam devaH prakramate svayam //*

or* nAham kartA hariH kartA.  
*

*  
*

There is not much new then in Kashmir S'aivism on this issue.  

*  
*

Whatever the details and specifics be, as remarked by Prof. Deshpande,

the discussion of *vis"aya-kartRka* and *As'raya-kartRka* become no longer relevant

- which is to say these do not answer in any manner the question first raised.

  

*ghaTah pas'yati* taken in this sense does not explain  

the issue raised by Haradatta in the context of grammar.

  

The expression being discussed pertains thus to ordinary transactions of the world,

and not to exalted states of consciousness or very special viewpoints  

where even ordinary occurrences take on a different hue.  

  

We need to look, then, into the way our thoughts find expressions in Sanskrit

(or even other languages of the world).

  

This issue needs to be taken up next.

The last mail of Sri Goswami has yet raised a part of the original question.
