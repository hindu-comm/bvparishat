This has taken me by storm.  
  
I'm trying to read Karmakartri Prakriya since morning of Siddhanta Kaumudi.  
  
I'm still on Yagn-lugnant in my studies. with Guruji. Will reach Karmakartri soon, but trying to figure out still. Kartristha Kriya and Karmastha Kriya still made the concept much better.  
Inwas actually skeptical about drish, since the beginning that this Dhatu differs from the likes of chhid, bhid etc but just didn't know the actual term of it.  
  
Now I am satisfied and kinda proud of myself hehe ðŸ˜….
