Prof Deshpande's verse can stir some deep feelings:

of shuddering at the tottering of towering figures!

  

Yogananda has taken us to another continent.

  

In prayoga texts (and in jyotis"a texts too perhaps), as too in yogic works,  

***ghaTa*** stands for the human body itself.

  

A simple example from literature is

*chinne rajjau ke **ghaTam** dhArayanti?*

(*Svapna-vAsavadatta* of BhAsa).

  

*ghaTa-s'rAddha* is a ritual.  

  

The ups and downs of our fate is well reflected in:

*etAn prapas'yasi **ghaTAn** jala-yantra-cakre  
*

*riktA bhavanti bharitA bharitAs' ca riktAH  
*

  

And who will not remember  

***ghaTA**nAm nirmAtus tribhuvana-vidhAtus' ca kalahaH !*

\- cited in *Vakrokti-jIvita*?

  

Here is one from *ParamArtha-sAra* of abhinavagupta -

*nijam anyad atha s'arIram*

***ghaTA**di vA tasya deva-gRham.*

  

plus the famous

*nAnAcchidra-**ghato**dara-sthita-mahA-dIpa-prabhA-bhAsvaraM  
*

*  
*

Good friendship and bad friendship contrasted:

*mRd-**ghaTa** iva sukha-bhedyo dussandhAnas'ca durjano bhavati/*

*sujanas tu kanaka-**ghaTa** iva durbhedyas sulabha-sandhAnas' ca//  
*

*  
*

*-* Just a few of the verses that came to my mind*  
*

*
