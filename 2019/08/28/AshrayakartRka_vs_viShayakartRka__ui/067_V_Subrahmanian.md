The pot-simile for the body has not left Tamil literature. Here is one:

  

<http://www.narayanmurti.com/4_38_nanndhavanathil.php>  

  

Nandhavanathil Ore Aandi Avan  
Naalaaru maathamai Kuyavanai Vendi  
Kondu Vandhan Oru Thondi  
Adhai Koothadi Koothadi Pottudaithaandi"

the meaning at the first look would seem funny. It means that a poor man in the garden begged for a pot for ten months from the potter. And he got it finally after ten months, but the poor man carelessly played and played with the pot and broke it. The above meaning might look as if the poor man's effort was a waste as he could not save the pot he begged, but the actual meaning is different and has an indepth meaning, but before that let us meaning of the words in the song.

Nandhavam - Garden, Earth  
Ore - one  
Aandi - Man without anything with him  
Avan - Personal Pronoun  
Naalaaru - Naalu + Aaru - Four + Six that is ten  
Maatham - Month  
Kuyavan - Potter, Creator  
Vendi - Beg, Ask

> And the Kannada song of Purandara dasa:  

  

ತಾರಕ್ಕ ಬಿಂದಿಗೆ ನಾ ನೀರಿಗೆ ಹೋಗುವೆ ತಾರೇ ಬಿಂದಿಗೆಯ,  
ಬಿಂದಿಗೆ ಒಡೆದಾರೆ, ಒಂದೇ ಕಾಸು, ತಾರೇ ಬಿಂದಿಗೆಯ

ರಾಮನಾಮವೆಂಬೋ ರಸವುಳ್ಳನೀರಿಗೆ ತಾರೇ ಬಿಂದಿಗೆಯ  
ಕಾಮಿನಿಯರ ಕೂಡೆ ಏಕಾಂತವಾಡೆನು ತಾರೆ ಬಿಂದಿಗೆಯ

ಬಿಂದುಮಾಧವನ ಘಟ್ಟಕ್ಕೆ ಹೋಗುವೆ ತಾರೆ ಬಿಂದಿಗೆಯ  

ಪುರಂದರ ವಿಠ್ಠಲಗೆ ಅಭಿಷೇಕ ಮಾಡುವೆ, ತಾರೆ ಬಿಂದಿಗೆಯ
