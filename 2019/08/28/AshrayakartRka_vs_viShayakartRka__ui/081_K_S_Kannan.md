Dear Murthy-ji,

Who indeed will not enjoy the spontaneity of your poetry?

That you still involve in it with zest despite your age and any concomitant frailty

is the good fortune indeed of the *rasika*-s and *sahRdaya*-s!

  

Of course, we can all irritate each other at times,

though none may love to do it on purpose.

*bhinna-rucir hi lokaH !*
