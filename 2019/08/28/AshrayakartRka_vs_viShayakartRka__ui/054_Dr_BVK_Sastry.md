Namaste



This discussion seems to be hopping all around , going away from the starting point and frame in which the post seems to have started.



The starting was from \< घटः पश्यति। .. विषयकर्तृकव्यापरः दृशेर्वाच्यः or आश्रयकर्तृकव्यापारः दृशेर्वाच्यः। \> in the frame of supposed worldly usage and classical grammar school.

The discussion elevated to touch the issues of Yogyataa- Indriaya- anaadi related. The scope now has further extended to touch western theories, Vishishtaadvaita/ Vaishnava -view based on a 'method of worship, where the practitioner faith-believes in specific guidance from Acharya, views from Kashmir Saivism ( refering to abhinavagupta) and Vedanta views. 



Surely this kind of discussion is a Kaleidoscopic perspective analysis of a given issue, which does yield a plurality of 'perceptions and explanations', but may not resolve the primary issue raised. Prof. Deshpande is right in pointing out **\< it appears that घट: पश्यतिhas a special interpretation within the system of Kashmir Shaivism>.** The ' plank of ' Pratyabhijna' is a different explanation and stands on different principles compared to ' Triputi in Shankara-vedanta'.



**Here are my submissions in this regard**:



1. ***Links to two volumes of Ishvara Pratyabhijna Vivruti vimarshini of Abhinavagupta : ( Total close to 800 pages Samskruth Text)***

2. **The term 'ghata' has a special meaning in the above text of Ishvara Pratyabhijna vimarshini**, pointing to anything that is manifest-finite entity that can be cognized and connoted with a name.



 Two references from abhinavaguptas work are placed below- **First one is from volume -1 where the pointer to ' ghatah pashyati' comes in**; second reference almost at the end of the second volume, where the return is made to very concept of what is a 'ghata', what is 'ghata-jnana' and the involved processes. The discussions throughout the text also covers -' wrong and doubtful perception, Self-perception of Knowledge and memory-recall-recognition', where the ' ashraya and vishaya' analysis is deeper and complex, without postulating the ' state of consciousness ( avashtaa-traya) element in linguistics'.



 The discussion covers two kinds of expressions which came in for a translation issue :

 The Pot sees (ghatah pashyati). The Pot is visible/ shines/ The pot is seen as pot ( ghatah avabhasate).

 :\<"घटः पश्यति" mean "घडा दिखता है" ? \> ; "घटः पश्यति" =
(Samskruth to English/ Hindi) = Pot sees ( now)/ Pot is seeing now ; घडा देखता है ; "घडा दिखता है" ? = (Hindi to Samskruth) = घटः दृश्यते - ( I, You, People) see the pot / ( I, You, People) can see the pot; it is visible.



 Through the discussions the textual segments views with illustrations from Veda, gita, Nyaya shastra, Vyakarana, Vedanta and alamkara are discussed.



 It is next to impossible to bring out the complex nature of discussion in the two volumes and explain the gist of the discussion without building a base of ' Pratyabhijna - (saiva- advaita) vimarsha : Terminology and fundamental concepts, for which this is not the occasion. What is technically presented is the unified philosophy as
seen in Bhartruhari and Sri-vidya- Tantra and Aagama schools.



 **The key concept is analysis of 'Vak' as Yoga-Samskrutham / Shabda-Brahma / (vak)-raso vai Saha . The technicalities of ashraya karturka, Vishaya, Vyaapaara- kriyaa are all explained within the frame work of 'Paninian rules'. **



**3. Here below is the first reference of the 'ghataH pashyati' in this work**: (<https://archive.org/details/IshvaraPratyabhijnaVivritiVimarshiniAbhinavaguptaPart1KashmirSanskrit/page/n30>)

 This discussion goes through the volume-1 to volume -2 almost to the end where the concept of 'ghata' is again introduced with a different model of ' poorva-paksha'.

4. The views under the term Aerial linguistics does not cover or come any way close to the linguistic concepts of bharateeya darshana shaastras. Aerial linguistics is explained in Wiki as : In linguistics, areal features are elements shared by languages or dialects in a geographic area, particularly when such features are not descended from a proto-language, or, common ancestor language. That is, an areal feature is contrasted to genealogically determined similarity within the same language family.



The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis is partial in its application to this care, where 'Samskrutham' does not fit in to the range of languages as the philosophical axioms and premise are totally non-matching. The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis is explained in Wiki as: The hypothesis of linguistic relativity, part of relativism, also known as the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis, or Whorfianism is a principle claiming that the *structure of a language affects its speakers' world view or cognition, and thus people's perceptions are relative to their spoken language.*
