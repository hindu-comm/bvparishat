*1. ghaTaH pas'yati* generated much questioning as it can be suspected of violating *LaukikI vivaks"A* itself  

(which can evoke questions like "What does it mean at all?" "Who would make such a sentence?" )  

  

2\. We are all used to sentences like *devadattaH pas'yati*, but not *ghaTaH pas'yati*.  

It is a question of violation of *yogyatA*, it was strongly suspected.

How can a pot see, after all?

  

3\. It offends our sensibilities both ways - if we assert that the pot sees,

and worse, if it were to be an expression of - a Devadatta seeing a pot - being described.

(Of course, there is no Devadatta in the actual sentence itself,

but the context (taken up in the original i.e. Haradatta's treatment of the issue) indicates the same).

  

4\. The confusion can happen to even those who may be native speakers,

or those who come close to being native speakers - by virtue of, say,  

living in a country where the language is spoken, or is acquired  

in the company of fairly good and articulate speakers of the language.

  

5\. (In languages like English, so dynamic, so unstable, it is not just that  

new lexemes keep coming into into operation, but that  

even extant lexical items can acquire newer denotations and connotations,

\- which is also to say acquiring/generating even newer *yogyatA*-s !).  

  

6\. (An easy example would be the recent advertisement : "Drink an apple".  

A solid (that the apple is) has no *yogyatA* to "be drunk",  

as one can only drink liquids. The advertised has "tampered with" the *yogyatA* here,

(by virtue of extending the sense of apple, famously a fruit, to the special apple juice)).

  

(In Sanskrit (as in many languages) a single word normally standing for the tree,

can also denote the fruit of the tree, some part/product of the tree etc.))  

  

7\. On the other hand, expressions that very well resemble *ghaTaH pas'yati,*

actually present in languages we are used to,  

will just not be suspected of such violations !  

We shall discuss some English examples also in order to show  

our partial (in)sensitivity to certain issues and phenomena.

  

8\. The essential "jarring" is - how can the same form *pas'yati* mean  

two "opposite" things viz. "to see" and "to appear"?

The two appear opposed primarily because the first sense is transitive,  

while the second sense is intransitive.

  

9\. But this in itself should not be a cause for worry, for there are verbs

which are either transitive or intransitive, depending on the sense they convey.

Take for example root *tap*. In constructions like *caNDAms'us tapati*, it is intransitive.

However, in constructions like *pas'yAmi tvAm ...vis'vamidam tapantam*, it is transitive.

"to burn" in English is an easy parallel.

  

10\. In Sanskrit we have many roots that have an *antarbhAvita-Nyartha*  

-as with root *ks"ar*, for example  

*tapaH ks"arati,* but

*es"aH tasya payaH ks"arati,* ( *ks"arati* has the sense of *ks"Arayati).*  

In English we have the parallel in

*The army **marches**.*

*The C-in-C **marches** the army.*

The latter has the Causative in built.

  

11.The question in such cases is whether we have polysemy or homonymy,  

and it can remain ambiguous.

  

12\. In our case,

in *devadattah ghaTam pas'yati*, Root *dRs'* is *sakarmaka*;

and in *ghaTaH pas'yati*, it looks *akarmaka*.

Such cases of the same root looking now transitive and now intransitive

can be puzzlesome. But the issue has been handled in Sanskrit grammar as nowhere else.

  

13\. Consider the stock example of *devadattaH odanam kAs:ThaiH sthAlyAm pacati.*

Devadatta cooks. As a result, raw and hard rice becomes soft rice.  

Suppose the rice is excellent. One will then say *odanaH pacyate svayam eva.*

where *odanaH* is in the Nominative. Rice cooks by itself (called *karmakartari*).

the extreme facility of cooking is emphasised here.  

  

The role of *odana* as undergoing *viklitti*,  

and the role of Devadatta imparting *vikledana* - are indicated by the same Root *pac*

*(dvyarthaH paciH).  
*

  

15\. It is up to the speaker's *vivaks"A* to highlight this or the other aspect in the sentence.

If he wants to emphasise the ease with which the high quality rice cooks,  

with almost no effort as it were on the part of the cook,  

then the speaker makes the *karman* behave like the *kartR*.  

The original *kartR* just does not figure in the sentence now:

see how Devadatta in (a)(b)(c)(d) below disappears in (a')(b')(c')(d'),  

with no role to play - as decided/intended by the speaker.  

  

16\. Roots are of four types viz.  

\(a\) *karmastha-bhAvaka* ex. *devadattaH odanam pacati*. Devadatta cooks rice.  

\(b\) *karmastha-kriyaka* ex. *devadattaH kAs"Tham bhinatti.* Devadatta splits wood.  

\(c\) *kartRstha-bhAvaka* ex.* devadattaH mAsam Aste*. Devadatta stays for a month.  

\(d\) *kartRstha-kriyaka.* ex. *devadattaH grAmam gacchati*. Devadatta goes to the village.  

  

17\. In (a), the result of the action (*bhAva*) resides in the *karman*, viz. the rice.

In (b), the action (*kriyA*) resides in the *karman*, viz. the wood.  

In (c), the result of the action (*bhAva*) resides in the *kartR*, not the *karman* (viz. the month).  

In (d), the action (*kriyA*) resides in the *kartR*, not the *karman* (viz. the village).  

  

18\. Only (a) and (b) can have *karmakartari-prayoga*, whence we have

(a') *odanaH pacyate svayam eva.*

(b') *bhidyante kAs"THAni svayam eva.*

  

19\. In the case of (c) and (d), we cannot have the *karmakartari*-*prayoga*,  

as the *bhava* and the *kriyA* reside in the *kartR*. We can thus have  

(c') *mAsa Aste svayam eva*, and

\(d\) ***grAmo gacchati*** *svayam eva.*

  

20\. In all of the above four (ie. a', b', c', d') *svayam eva* is only for elucidation,

to indicate that Devadatta has no role to play.  

  

21\. The last sentence here must be noted.

Root *gam* is *sakarmaka* (in Sanskrit).

The ease with which one goes to the village is being expressed.

(The root does not take the *Atmane* construction as it is not *karmakartari*).

  

22\. Now it is to this last category that  

*devadatto ghatam pas'yati* belongs.

The ease with which the pot is seen, which is to say  

the pot appears on its own or of itself, is represented as

***ghaTaH pas'yati.***

  

23\. The discussion presented in **padaman"jarI** of *Haradatta on *kAs'ikA* on 1.4. 33*  

shows the classification of *vis"aya-kartRka* and *As'raya-kartRka* varities.

  

24\. Further, he says that the *svAtantrya* can be as per the reality outside (*kvacid vAstavikam*)

or as per the intention of the speaker (*kvacid **vaivaks"ikam***)

In the case of *devadattAya rocate modakaH,*

*modaka* has become the *kartR* because, as per the speaker,  

the *modaka* has triggered the desire (*abhilas"a*) which is in Devadatta (*devadattAs'raya*),

on account of its high delectability (*mAdhuryAtis'ayena*).

  

25\. The question next asked is why this happens with *ruc*, and not with *las".*

It is here that Haradatta says it is on account of ***abhidhAna-s'akti-vaicitrya:***

the *abhilAs"a* in the case of *As'raya-kartRka,*

and the *abhilAs"a* in the case of *ruc* is *vis"aya-kartRka.*

  

26\. It is here that Haradatta introduces the example of *ghaTaH pas'yati.*

In the case of *DevadattaH ghaTam pas'yati,*  

if the speaker intends to elevate *ghaTa* to the level of the *kartR*,

eliminating the role of Devadatta thereby,

then he would say ***ghaTaH pas'yati.***  

  

27\. In the case of the root *dRs'*, the *jn"Ana* is *As'raya-kartRka.*

In the case of a construction like *ghaTaH prakAs'ate,*

the *jn"Ana* is *vis"aya-kartRka.*

  

28\. Actually speaking, Haradatta is taking up the example of *ghaTaH pas'yati* as an analogy,

which means it is more easily understood!

Of the two, the *upamAna* and the *upameya*,

the *upamAna* is the more famous, and more easily understood.

We give an *upamAna* to illustrate and elucidate.

It is almost a pity that we are insensitive to it.

  

29\. Another example discussed by grammarians is  

\(a\) *pas'yanti bhavam bhaktAH*.(The devotees behold S'iva)  

\(b\) ***pas'yati bhavaH (S'iva gets seen).***

The first verb, *pas'yanti*, is explained as *cAks"us"ajn"Anena vis"ayIkurvanti.*

The second verb, *pas'yati*, is explained as \[*bhavaH*\] *vis"ayIbhavati.*

The reason for (b) is given is

*saukaryAtis'aya-vivaks"ayA preraNAms'as tyajyate*  

  

30\. In English, as pointed out aptly by Dr. Vineet Chaitanya-ji,

such constructions are common.

  

We lose sensitivity when we quite commonly come across such usages,

as we get less observant with taken-for-granted feeling.

  

31\. Consider the role of the verb in the following passages:

(a)Devadatta reads the passage.

(b)*The passage **reads**.*

  

(a)Devadatta is cooking the dinner.  

(b)*The dinner is **cooking**.*

  

(a)Devadatta broke the pot.

(b)*The pot **broke**.*

  

(a)Devadatta opened the lock.  

(b)*The lock **opened**.*

  

32\. Sanskrit grammarians have gone to subtler levels

as when discussing *bhidyate kusUlaH svayam eva.*

33\. In other words, such types of *karmakartR-prayoga* are universal.

Grammars of other languages are yet to take note of this phenomenon.

(Some ideas had to be repeated as there seemed to be no clarity yet for some of the readers).
