The next issue is of the two sentences:

1\. *ghaTaH pas'yati*

and

2\. *ghaTaH prakAs'ate.*

These two sentences also mean the same thing, ultimately.

Both mean  

3\. Devadatta sees(=knows) the *ghaTa*.

  

Yet, there is a subtle difference.

4\. The real meaning of 1 is "The ghaTa appears".

5\. The real meaning of 2 is "The ghaTa shines".

  

This is stated technically thus:

6\. In 1, ie. with *dRs'*, the knowledge (*jn"Ana*) is *As'raya-kartRka*.

7\. In 2, ie. with *pra+kAs'*, the knowledge (*jn"Ana*) is *vis"aya-kartRka*.

  

When do we say *ghaTaH prakAs'ate*?

It is when the *ghaTa* is present in a place (*madhya-varti*)  

which has good illumination (*spas"TAloka*).

What is the speciality here? What difference does it make?

There is a certain ease (*saukarya*) in generating the *jn"Ana* for Devadatta.

And Devadatta is the *As'raya* of the *jn"Ana.*

*  
*

The issue is dealt with by BhATTa-mImAmsaka-s

under the heading of *prAkaTya.  
*

  

All this is my guesswork.

*atra vidvAMsaH pramANam\|\|!*

*  
*

I look forward to better and more complete explanations.

(The problem is : we rarely come across the *ghaTaH pas'yati* type of usages.)
