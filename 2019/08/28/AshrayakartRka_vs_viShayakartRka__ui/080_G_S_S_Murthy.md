I am thankful to Prof. Deshpandeji and Prof. Kannanji for their kind words. I wish I knew Marathi to enjoy the poem posted by Prof.Deshpandeji. I am aware of my insignificance in this group where scholars of international repute, poets of eminence, Mahamahopadhyayas, President's award winners are all there. What am I if not a gadfly.

Thanks and regards,

Murthy
