Dear Harunaga,

  

  Thanks for pointing to this attestation ofघट: पश्यति in Abhinavagupta's Īśvarapratyabhijñāvivr̥tivimarśinī. After reading Abhinavagupta's Vimarśinī with Bhāskarī \[ed by K. C. Pandey, Vol I, p. 77\], it appears that घट: पश्यतिhas a special interpretation within the system of Kashmir Shaivism. Some of this special interpretation is found in the Vimarśinī \[with a quote from Śivadr̥ṣṭi\] and Bhāskarī, where the perceived external object is truly a projection of the perceiver, and not substantively different from it.

Here is K. C. Pandey's translation of the quoted Śivadr̥ṣṭi verses:

  

"Jar (is one with myself at the time of my desire to know and therefore) knows as one with myself. And I am one with jar in knowing. Sadāśiva knows as myself. And I know as Sadāśiva. Śiva alone shines, knowing himself through the multiplicity of objects."

  

Again, thanks for referring to this very special instance of घट: पश्यति, which has a very special interpretation. With best wishes,
