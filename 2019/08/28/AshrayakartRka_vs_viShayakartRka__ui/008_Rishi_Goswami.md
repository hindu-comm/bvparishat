Thank you shastryji for explanation.  
  
Is there any Spanish scholar here or has anyone of the scholars who is a lingusit read about any such explanation?  
  
In Spanish, there are many such विषयकर्तृकव्यापारवाचक Dhatus, take for example रुच only = gustar.  
  
Te gusta. ते रोचते।  
Me gusta. मे/मह्यम् रोचते।  
(te and me = ते + मे यथावत्।  
Gusta is प्र.पु.1वचन।).  
  
Similarly, Spanish uses many such Dhatus, take for example despertar जागरणे।  
In common usage, anyone would say "tu despiertas?" "त्वं जागर्षि?" 【Where tu means त्वम् and any root with स् in end is मध्यम-पु-1वचन, same like Sanskrit. Despiertas is म-पु-1.】  
But this usage is wrong. It should be "te despiertas?" "तुभ्यं जागर्षि?" if literally translated.  
  
Another example would be "No Me Acuerdo" which means "अहं न स्मरामि" but it literally translates to "नो मे स्मरति"।  
  
There is a long list of such verbs they probably call "reflexive verbs"(?).  
  
If any Spaniard/Linguist out here who can help explain such concepts if he has it in his language.
