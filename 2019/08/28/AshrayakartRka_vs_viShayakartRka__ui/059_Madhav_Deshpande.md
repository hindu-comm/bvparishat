Thanks, Professor Kannan, for a brilliant analysis and references to Haradatta. As G. S. S Murthy Ji observed "Some specimens have withered \[ ghaTaH pashyati\] and some are still alive \[odanaH pacati\]." This is what makes a usage like घट: पश्यति somewhat unusual. As Bhāsa said in his Svapnavāsavadattam: "अपरिचयात्तु न श्लिष्यते मे मनसि."
Otherwise, the Śāstric explnations are fine. With best regards,
