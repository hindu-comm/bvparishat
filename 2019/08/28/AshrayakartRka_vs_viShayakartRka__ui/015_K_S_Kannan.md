The three examples of Sri Subrahmanyan-ji are all cases of mere *akarmaka* roots and the actions they involve in.

The issue can easily get confounded with the common-sensically expected *caitanya* of the *kartR* of any action.

Animation is no pre-condition of agency. In no language.

  

What we are discussing here is unique to Sanskrit in the sense that

in no other grammar have subtleties of observation and expression taken to such depths.
