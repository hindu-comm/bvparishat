Namaste,

  

A very apt example.

This verse reminds me of Omar Khayya's potter and the pot verses: for example,

> 
> > After a momentary silence spake >
> 
> > 
> > Some Vessel of a more ungainly Make; >
> 
> > 
> >   "They sneer at me for leaning all awry: >
> 
> > 
> > What! did the hand then of the Potter shake?" >
> 
> > 
> >   
> >
