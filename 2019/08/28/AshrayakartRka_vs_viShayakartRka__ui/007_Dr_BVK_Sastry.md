Namaste



1. This is an interesting thread, which has connection to classical deliberation covering themes like :



 (i) (Vak-Artha), ( Vivakshita-Artha), (Anvaya-Artha), (Tatparya-Artha).

 (ii) mind-processes ( = vyaapaaras) of abhidaa, lakshanaa, vyanjanaa.

 (iii) saamarthya- yogyataa -shakti of 'pada', pratyaya', and 'prakriyaa'.

 (iv) Dhatvartha-prakashana ( Power of communication from verb which is different from noun)

 (v) Pratayartha- prakashana ( The power of communication of different pratyaya's of sup, Ting, Krit, Taddhita and processes like 'samasa, svara).



The understanding of what 'Samskrutha- Padam / vakyam' means a total
deliberation on all these factors along with ' level of consciousness (**chaitanya-avasthaa**)'. This is the big-picture of 'Yoga-Samskrutham' as Vak-Yoga given by Panini-Patanjali- Yaska unified teaching under Vedanga language modeling. We have in this deliberation opinions, text -statement positions, classical interpretations and expectations from the text. Responses in each model is different.



2. The analysis of sentences/ usage like \< *ghaṭaḥ paśyati* \> which is a sentence structure ( vakya) made up of two words (Subanta pada - tinganata pada) put together cannot be simplified for analytics by abstraction of logic like (N-V) generic combination for programming. Language grammar is different from the logic of mathematics.



 The language expressions like the one under discussion, where meaning construction has involved mind-processes are analyzed in traditional schools, under the ' lakshanaa- vyanjanaa' mind-processes. This deliberation covers cases 

 (a) where the Noun word is 'not a conscious being like devadatta'

 (b) how such sentences still serves the purpose of
practical communication.

There are illustrated and analyzed examples involving the technicality of ' upaadaana- lakshanaa' ( Mammata's Kavya Prakasha- Chap.2- Kariaa -10: illustrated example kuntaaH pravishanti).



 The involved processes are analyzed in detail. The contrast between a vedic expression and worldly expression are also explained in such a case. The classical traditions have a total clarity on how to keep 'Veda-Artha' in the frame of 'Vedanga (Vision, Darshana) ' and keep
out of the ' Vyanjana-Vyapara' as ' kavya-artha ( literature, poets license and freedom to portray self experience and creativity) '. This sacred line is violated in several translations and ' academic exercises of what veda means'.



3. This is on the ***'given ground*** of language-grammar-meaning convention-usage (**vruddha-vyavahara**)' in the framework of Paninian Language : Samskrutham (Chandas and Bhashaa) and related language tools of Kosha's. 



 This analysis is not fully portable for Non-Samskruth languages, Prakruths, Social language usage beyond ' Shishta vyavahara'. The additional factor to be analyzed would be the ' distancing-difference- deviation ( = **praak- krutatva**) between architecture of 'Samskrutham (Chandas and Bhashaa) and Prakrutha family of languages.



4. When there is ***Ground-Shift of language-grammar-meaning convention-usage (vruddha-vyavahara)' beyond the framework of Paninian Language, bringing in the challenges of translation*** *, specifically* in to a language like 'english', there are deeper additional factors to be analyzed. This phase is called ' apa-bhramsha ( fallen ) and mlecchita (corrupted) state of language. 

The deliberation goes to the level of language architecture, basic units of character set and phonemes (= Varna-maalaa, Shikshaa ),
challenging the basics of the grammar processing rules (= vyakarana) and Word-Meaning derivation process (= Kosha and Nirukti).



5. Progressing on this, when there is ***Alien axiomatic ground- mounted on 'given communicative expression' which already has suffered ' ground-shift deterioration due to translation' impacting language architecture -grammar- meaning convention-usage (vruddha-vyavahara)' beyond the framework of native language, and analyst is a 'Techno-Linguist' who is planning to*** extract the ' Universal human Communication model' using the 'language-analytics in Samskrutham ( = Vak-Artha Jijnyaasaa), there are more complexities. The primary issue being the clarity on ' what differentiates a conscious being ( = kartaa, vaktaa jnaataa - sachetanah)- and ' mind-less machine' . The unqualified axioms at this level between the schools provide different perspectives.



 Samskruth analysts are comfortable in explaining mind-processes ( chitta -vrutti- vyaapaara) in ' gangayam ghoshah, devadatah pashyati'. When the question shifts to debate why/ how 'Devadatta is different from 'ghata', the explanation becomes challenging. These are the questions debated in a different discipline with the theme lines like: Virtual Consciousness, Does robots have emotions' et al. Tradition discusses this under 'Veda- Shabda-Artha'. When Techno-Linguist / indologist corrupts the meaning of 'Veda', the rest of the discussion becomes meaningless.



6. If one were to take the route of \<**self experience**\> and \< **explanation for it from first principles**\>, keeping aside all the language frames, terminologies and previous traditions, it is an exploration of the classical form of the question in Vedanta like :
Bruhadaranayaka: मन्त्र ३\[III.ii.3\] वाग्वै ग्रहः । स नाम्नातिग्राहेण गृहीतो वाचा हि नामान्यभिवदति ॥ ३॥ 3.2.3 . This deliberates on Origin of the Universe & Conscious being/ consciousness in the deliberating person , the name- form association in language activities. It is here we get the hidden skeletons of theological axioms and spiritual discussions roll out ! to explain religion from
modern science !



 If the discussion is on this layer, then the topic is beyond the scope of public forum discussion . It is a personal inward exploration, a yoga- journey exploring ' Vak', and 'Vak- Indriya'.

 There will be no need to explain the experience to others; or seek validation of experience with other textual resources. The Sutra of Panini \< रुच्यार्थानां प्रीयमाणः \> is a 'Darshana- Aakhyana' :: Vision and articulation of the Mind-processes and articulation processes, the analysis and articulation of giving a name to an experience at this layer of consciousness, saying the seeing, the
experience as self observation. The user of Paninian rule has the freedom of choice to experience the process as vak-yoga or imitate the process to generate the final word form ( like devAya, devadattAya
is similar to ramAya because of a-ending and masculine gender tag). 



7. It is at this level one needs to see the two sentences : \<*devadattaH modakam abhilas"ati, ****and*** *devadattAya rocate modakaH.*\> supposed to \< convey the same idea ultimately: \> . **Apparently this looks so**; but when two different 'Dhatu's are used in expression, with different processing ( dhatu -pratyaya -prakriyaa) the idea conveyed is NOT the same ! nor similar. Each expression is unique ! Because the speaker intends to convey different experiences.
The difference in dhatu-artha is placed below:
