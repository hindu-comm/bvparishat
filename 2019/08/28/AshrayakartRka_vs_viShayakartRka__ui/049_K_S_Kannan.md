1\. The question boils down to how exactly do we express our thoughts.

  

2\. The flow obviously is from *manas* and its desire to speak.

"*The Atman, united with **buddhi**, enjoins the **manas** with the intention to speak*"

*"AtmA buddhyA sametyArthAn mano yun'kte vivaks"ayA".*

  

3\. Now, *vAc* is said to be but a canal for *manas*:

"*manasaH kulyA vAk*."

  

4\. What happens in the external world is filtered through the *saMskAra*-s in the *manas* of the perceiver.

Thus, there is no *pratyaks"a* which is not shaped by the *saMskAra*-s, present and past.

To use the words of philosophers of science, "there is no observation that is not theory-laden".

*SaMskAra*-s are not limited, of course, just to the theory known to the experiencer.

  

5\. Upon *vivaks"A*, the primary urge to speak, two filters happen to play their role.  

The two are *LaukikI vivaks"A* and *PrAyoktrI vivakSA.*

  

6. *LaukikI vivaks"A* is the regulation of the speech by the world.

This is what meant by what Patan"jali often dismisses certain expressions simply as - *anabhidhAnAt*,  

the *s'is"Ta*-s do not speak so (more or less equivalent to "native speakers would not speak it that way").

  

7\. This is also where figures the non-equivalence across languages,

whether in terms of syntax or vocables.  

Each language thus has "her own" genius, and her own limitations.

The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis has enough material to be invoked here

(even though there are certain views counter to this).

The concepts of Areal Linguistics are also similarly relevant here

(Masica-Emeneau-Shapiro-Schiffman).

Studies of kinship terms and colour terms (made by linguistic anthropologists)

lay bare the underlying linguistic relativism.  

  

8\. *PrAyoktrI vivaks"A*, while fully conforming to *LaukikI
*vivaks"A** (of which it is but a subset, so to say),

makes certain choices - so as to to reveal something, or just veil something,

to underscore something, or to underplay something.  

It is the sweet will of the speaker to withhold something or overstate something.

(This is an area of overlap between grammar and rhetorics.

Rhetorics takes over from where grammar leaves off).  

  

9\. It is this domain - of what the speaker intends to express that pANini has to handle  

whence the archetype of his *sUtra*-s is:

"In this sense (the same as "In order to express this sense"), this item is prescribed."  

  

10\. The *kAraka* Theory is as it were the hinge on which the system of pANini turns.

*vivaks"A* settles the *kAraka*-representation (whence ends the essential role of semantics),

and thereafter commences the mundane role of syntactics : the *vibhakti* presentations.

  

11\. It is here, in the ***kAraka* to *vibhakti* mapping stage**, that "*ghaTaH pas'yati*",  

sounding so counter-intuitive - so as to be easily suspected of being merely a metaphorical  

(or even hazily connotative, or plain irregular/just unacceptable) construction :

from being of the types of *s'rNota grAvANaH* to *kuntAH pravis'anti* to *jarbharI turpharI tu*,

(or even naming somebody as Mr. GhatTa - say, for the sake of a story).

  

12\. Against the above background, what exactly can impel one to say *ghaTaH pas'yati*  

can now be seen more clearly. In other words, it is a clearer understanding of *kAraka*-s that is called for.

  

The evidence for this is also plain: Haradatta does not invoke any concept herein  

from the field of Kashmir S'aivism or Tantra, with which Abhinavagupta is so much associated,  

and whose ideas have links, parallels, or kinship with many of those of BhartRhari.

Haradatta is very plain: He starts the discussion with the prefatory words such as *abhidhAna-s'akti-vaicitrya  
*

or what is more or less the same, said alternatively as, *abhidhAna-niyama-prakAra,  
*

meaning, "the idiosyncrasy of the power of expression" or "the mode of regulation of expression".

(Obviously, this rules out the realm of rhetorics, of the need of invoking *laks"aNA* or *vyan"janA*).

We often come across the word *s'abda-s'akti-svAbhAvya* (the nature of the (primary) power of the word)  

also in the same sense.  

  

13\. To meet what idea is the expression *ghaTaH pas'yati* designed  

can now be more easily grasped.
