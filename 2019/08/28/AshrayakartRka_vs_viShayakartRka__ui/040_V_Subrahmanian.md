Dear Madhav ji,

  

Thanks for producing this image from the book. On reading it I get the 'pratyabhijnaa' of the prakriyaa for perception in Advaita as taught in the Vedanta Paribhasha: Since the entire world is a superimposition on Brahman according to Advaita, during the act of perception, the knower, pramaataa (pramaatr-chaitanyam), the pramaana chaitanyam (the knowing/instrument) and the prameya chaitanyam (the object, ghaTa, for example) become 'one.' This is called 'ekaloleebhaavah'. In the image you have provided, the ghaTa's 'knowing' is nothing but its becoming the vishaya chaitanyam for this pramiti that is generated from the vyaapaara of knowing. It is not actually the ghaTa knowing anything as one would think/expect when one hears the expression 'ghaTah pashyati/vEtti'.
Thus, ultimately, it is 'अहमेव मदात्मना मामेव वेद्मि'. There is no kartr-karma virodha here since all the three, triputee, involved here are designated as different upadhi-s, तेषाम् औपाधिकभेदात् \| 

  

Interesting indeed.

  

warm regards
