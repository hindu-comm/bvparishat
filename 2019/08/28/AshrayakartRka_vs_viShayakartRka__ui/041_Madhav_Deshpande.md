Dear Subrahmanian Ji,

  

  You got the essential point. From the point of view of Kashmir Pratyabhijñā or Advaita, in an example like this, the distinction ofआश्रयकर्तृक vs विषयकर्तृक is no longer relevant. That is what the verse from Śivadr̥ṣṭi is saying: घटो मदात्मना वेत्ति वेद्म्यहं च घटात्मना. Best regards,
