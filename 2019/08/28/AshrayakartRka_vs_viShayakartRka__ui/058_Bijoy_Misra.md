Prof. Kannan,

  

Through my years on earth, I do see two approaches to life and knowing.

One is scientific understanding where you are aware of your ignorance at every step,

a lot remains to be known than what is known. Knowledge becomes an exploration.

The other is engineering understanding in order to wrap up and create workable theories.

Our daily living gets engineered since we have little scope to understand, we ride the train.

  

What you have said in the post is that there did exist a time where pure knowledge was

explored and waited upon. People appreciated the process of foundational understanding.

From our analysis of history in our India Discovery Center, we are coming to the conclusion

that such a foundational state was possible because of total security of food in the land.

Food security brought security to society which in turn helped propel independent thinking.

  

Food insecurity was imposed artificially by about 1600AD because of land redistribution.

This brought in engineering methods some of which were also imposed through language,

religion and customs. Many tried engineering regimentation through caste, cult and

social assumptions. The free India is still struggling to recover, but political regimentation

also lurks.

  

The good news is that the foundational science is alive. We salute all the remote scholars

who have retained the tradition of exploring knowledge through debate, analysis and understanding.

Some brand this as Hindu to create a caricature. As I see Indian दर्शन is pure science and

all scholars (including me) need a through grinding to appreciate the neural work in analysis.  

  

Sorry for this digression.  

  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
