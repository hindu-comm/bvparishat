I would like to write a few words about *pas'yati* and *prakAs'ate.*

For this is the more subtle issue - even though Haradatta has placed it as an exact parallel to *rocate* and *abhilas"ati.*

The parallel is one no doubt of utter lexicality, but the issue of confusibles must be raised and discussed.*

I do not have time right now.

I will perhaps resume after a few hours.
