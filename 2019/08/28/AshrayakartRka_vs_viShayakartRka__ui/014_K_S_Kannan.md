The idea as I read is this.

  

1\. In the two (pairs of) cognate actions that we are looking into,  

viz. (a) "to like"/"to desire"

and (b) "to appear"/"to shine",

there is the difference of *what **spurs** the action*.

  

2\. Needless to say, it means, what the speaker intends to represent it as.

In other words, it is an issue of *vivaks"A.*

  

3\. *kartRtva* is indeed pre-eminently a matter of *vivaks"A*.  

4\. And *vivaks"A*, as we know, controls the *kAraka*-s, which in turn control the *vibhakti*-s.

  

5\. Sometimes the initiative for the action issues from the *As'raya* (= here, the *kartR* himself).

6\. Sometimes the initiative for the action issues from the *vis"aya* (= here, the *karman*).  

7\. In the case of the root *rocate* and *abhilas"ati*,  

the *kartR*-s are *modaka* and Devadatta respectively,

even though the same action - of Devadatta liking the *modaka* - is described.

  

8\. If the speaker wants to portray the desire as initiating from Devadatta,

he will choose the root *abhilas".*

9\. If the speaker wants to portray the desire as triggering from *modaka*,

he will choose the root *ruc*.

  

10\. In fine, in the case of 8, it is as though a "weakness"/"idiosyncrasy" of Devadatta is portrayed/underlined/suggested.

11\. And similarly, in the case of 9, it is as though the "delectability" of the *modaka* is portrayed/underlined/suggested.

12\. Of course, if the *modaka* is not delectable, Devadatta's desire would not be triggered, and

if Devadatta has weakness for sweets, he would not be drawn towards the *modaka*.

A mutuality can be discerned in situations such as this.  

  

13\. The *indriya* and the *indriyArtha* are thus as though made for each other.

This is one mutuality.

14\. At another level, the words *rocate* and *abhilas"ati* have their own idiosyncrasies  

\- in the sense that what sense one word conveys, the other cannot.

This is another mutuality.  

15\. The first one (=13 above) lays bare the *yogyatA,* as it were, between *indriya* and *indriyArtha .*  

(Devadatta being a proxy for the *indriya* (= his *rasanA*)).

16\. The next one (=14 above) lays bare the *yogyatA* between *s'abda* and *artha*.

17\. The notion of irreplaceability figures in rhetorics as *parivRtty-asahatva*/*pAka* (which we will not go into here).

  

18\. In effect, there is in Sanskrit grammar (as in Sanskrit poetics),  

a keen observation of what happens in the world, as well as what language does:

this, then, is an issue of reality and representation,

of what is and what is (sought to be) expressed.

  

So with "*pas'yati*" and "*prakAs'ate*".

  

I hope I have not overstated my case.
