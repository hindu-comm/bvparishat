Dear List Members,

  

I am looking for a definition of the term ‘*jīvanādṛṣṭa*’ from pre-Maṇḍana Sanskrit philosophical works. From Vācaspati Miśra’s commentary, *Nyāyakaṇikā*, on Maṇḍana Miśra’s *Vidhiviveka*, it is clear that the term ‘*jīvanādṛṣṭa*’ is used interchangeably with ‘*karmāśaya*’ and ‘*jātiviśeṣādṛṣṭa*’. I am aware of the fact that *jīvana* or life is defined as ‘*vipacyamānakarmāśayamātraṃ jīvanam*…’ in Vātsyāyana’s *Nyāyabhāṣya* ad. *Nyāyasūtra* 3.2.27. But a formal definition or explanation of the concept of *karmāśaya* and/or *jīvanādṛṣṭa*, *jātiviśeṣādṛṣṭa* *frompre-Maṇḍana (and as a matter of thatpre-Vidhiviveka) Sanskrit philosophical works* which can serve as the historical source for Maṇḍana Miśra would be extremely helpful.



I look forward to your kind and enlightening reply in this regard.



Thanks in advance.



Best regards,

Sudipta Munsi
