ॐ The chandas for praNava is daivi Gayatri (Not Devi Gayatri) as per Pingala's Chandashastra

Daivi gayatri is the schema for single syllable mantras/bijas

  

Please refer to the book on Chandashastra...for every number of syllables there is a specific type of Gayatri --for ex 23 syllable gayatri is called nichṛt gayatri...and so on.

  

"Similarly in navakshari the chandas is gayatri,ushnik& anushtup as per Gorakhpur publication...? How to fit 9 letters in the 3 chandas?"

  

--> Can you kindly give more context regarding this last statement?
