Here is a write up about the topic:

  

Summary: The Zodiac Pillars of Sringeri Vidyāśaṅkara Temple  
  
Sringeri Vidyāśaṅkara temple’s rhythmic architecture is lauded, by the connoisseurs of the architectural art, as a “poem in stone”. The site is compared to Taj at Agra by M.H.Krishna (Mysore archeological Department 1936.). It is well known that there is a zodiac pillar hall with twelve pillars within the Vidyāśaṅkara temple. The integral play of the seasonal Sunlight on these zodiac pillars enlivens this architectural masterpiece.  There have been two scientific studies on the astronomical features of the temple. However, this temple remains a lustrous jewel hidden in plain sight for various reasons.   
  
Proper understanding of the astronomical phenomena at the temple needs the study of the Cultural Context of the temple and comprehensive scientific studies of the astronomical features consistent with the context.  
  
The cultural context and the earlier research has been done in depth. The team has conducted comprehensive independent study at the temple and compared and contrasted the results with the previous studies.   
Presentation will have the details of the study and future plans.
