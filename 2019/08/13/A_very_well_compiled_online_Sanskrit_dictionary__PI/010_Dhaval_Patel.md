I am sure all of you must be aware of this -<https://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/>

  

All the dictionaries which exist out there were mostly a snapshot of this dictionary collection. It has 36 dicts as present.

  

I recommend using these dictionaries at Cologne, because they are updated constantly based on user submitted corrections. All other dictionaries available at other places do not necessarily keep up with the corrections made.
