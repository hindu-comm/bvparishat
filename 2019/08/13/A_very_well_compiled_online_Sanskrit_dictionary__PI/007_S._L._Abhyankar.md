I typed "a" expecting good detail about the first letter अin देवनागरी.

Result was not satisfactory.  

In Apte's dictionary at \<<https://dsalsrv04.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/app/apte_query.py?page=1>\> one gets not only quite sumptuous details, but also \<*N. B.--*The application of this privative prefix is practically unlimited; to give every possible case would almost amount to a dictionary itself.\>
