Irene,  
  
The cumulative Sanskrit dictionary with the German title  
"Nachtragswörterbuch des Sanskrit" (NWS) is the result of a joint  
project at the German universities of Halle and Marburg and funded by  
the DFG ("Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft" = German Research  
Foundation). You will find a list of the team members here:

This search tool lists lexicographical addenda from c. 170  
dictionaries and glossaries, which postdate Böhtlingk's  
"Sanskrit-Wörterbuch in kürzerer Fassung" (1879-89) as well as R.  
Schmidts "Nachträge" (1928):
