Dear Smt Irene ji,

  

Thanks. What is the translator's full name? Is it unabridged?

  

If it is Seshagiri Rao as given here-->

<https://www.worldcat.org/title/kumaravyasa-mahabharata-abridged-an-english-transcreation-of-kumaravyasas-karnata-bharata-kathamanjari/oclc/17478380/editions?referer=di&editionsView=true>

  

They all seem to be abridged.

  

  

Regards,

  

Venkat
