Venkat ji,  
  
Yes, you've got the name correct, and, as far as I know, the abridged  
version is all that exists at the moment. I had a quick look at the  
translation; it may not be the smoothest, but it's OK. Apparently  
Murty Classical Library was planning a 3 volume set, but I don't know  
where they are with that project.  
  
Best wishes,  
Irene
