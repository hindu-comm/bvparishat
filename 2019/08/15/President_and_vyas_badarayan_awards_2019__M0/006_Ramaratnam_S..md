I take this opportunity to congratulate all those scholars who are conferred with the President's award for Sanskrit this year. I am particularly happy to see the names of two scholars who are intimately known to me. One is Dr. Kala Acharya who published my book 'The Ritual Traditions of India' from K.J. Somaiya Bharatiya Samskrit Peetham, Mumbai, of which she is the Director. The second is Dr. V.S.Karunakarcharya who composed a few verses in Sanskrit on the writer of this note during release function of the same book in Chennai, a couple of years back. I congratulate them once again.  

Dr.S.Ramaratnam,

Vice Chancellor,

Jagadguru Kripalu University,

Odisha
