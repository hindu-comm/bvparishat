Happy 73rd Independence Day: Honor  
INDEPENDENCE Re-defined  
Independence is a state of perfection caught or cultivated -not when  
nothing more can be added, but when nothing more left to be taken away  
(set free from accumulated conditioning); and getting adaptive to think  
or act the way it ought to be...  
  
Shun any actions that will diminish honor,  
even if they are vital for the preservation of life.  
Those who honorably pursue glory never act ingloriously,  
even if glorious fame is to be gained.  
Cultivate modesty in the midst of good fortune,  
but in times of adversity preserve your dignity.  
Honorable men fallen from high status  
are like useless hair fallen from the head.  
Unworthy acts, though mustard-seed small, will bring down  
a man, though he towers like a mountain.  
It offers neither Earth's renown nor Heaven's refuge,  
so why do men run after and stand by those who revile them?  
Better to die right where you stand, the saying goes,  
than to live running after those who despise you.  
Will any medicine preserve the body of the high-born man  
whose honor has already perished?  
Shorn of its hair, the yak will refuse to live.  
Such men do exist who prefer death to the loss of honor.  
The world will extol and exalt honorable men  
who exult in death rather than endure dishonor.
