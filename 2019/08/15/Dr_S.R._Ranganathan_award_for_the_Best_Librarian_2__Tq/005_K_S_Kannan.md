Hearty congratulations for the award.

  

SRR was a highly original mind.

  

Entangled in copyright feuds among his legal heirs,

his works remained out of print unfortunately for far too long

(and other library systems happened to come to fill the vacuum thus created).  

From what I have heard, many core ideas of SRR's Classification System

had their origin in the Hindu heritage.

  

Getting an award associated with SRR's hallowed name is no small credit!

Best wishes to Dr. Narenthiran!
