Namaste Dr. Bagchee,

  

Thank you, not only for penning this (and sharing it) but also for—amongst many other clearly and effectively articulated points—stating, bluntly, that "the dichotomy is false and self-serving" \[p. 2 inVishwa Adluri & Joydeep Bagchee (2019): Authors’ response to Book Review of The Nay Science. A History of German Indology, South Asia: Journal of South Asian Studies, DOI: 10.1080/00856401.2019.1635312\].

  

Grateful.

  

Sincerely,

Megh
