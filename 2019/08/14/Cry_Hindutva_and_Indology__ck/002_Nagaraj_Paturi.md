Dr. Bagchee,

  

You and Prof. Vishwa Adluri are models to emulated for vast erudition , deep training directly under stalwarts of the fields, rigorous and well substantiated analysis and argumentation.

  

This response from you to the strawman arguments against your book is another example of your scholarly approach.

  

Thanks for sharing.

  

Regards,

  

Nagaraj
