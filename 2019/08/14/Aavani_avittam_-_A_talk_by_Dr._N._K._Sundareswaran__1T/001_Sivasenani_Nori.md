Thank you, Sir, for this talk.

  

I observe that my Tamilian friends have a very elaborate ceremony resembling the upaakarma for changing their yajnopaveetam, whereas in Telugu families changing the sacred thread is a much simpler affair (sankalpa, short puja of the yajnopaveetam, and then dhaarana). I used to wonder about this difference. From your talk I realized that it is indeed upaakarma that is referred to as avani avittam (my knowledge of Tamil is very basic, but your talk was so full of Sanskrit terms, that I could follow the talk fairly well).

  

Regards

N Siva Senani
