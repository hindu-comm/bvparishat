Pranam,

  

My localtemple performing Maha-Kumbhabhishekam. Last yearpriests
broughtdown the Gopuram- Kalash from the top of the temple, now it is time forputting itback.

It has been one year, they were repairing the temple-top.

  

So, I like to know what is (Maha) Kumbhabhishekam. ? When this rituals is performed ?

  

Does the Gopuram-Kalash stays inside for one year or there is not such specific time period ?

  

How can I find more scriptural reading on Kumbhabishekam ?

  

Thank you very much for replying to my question.

  

  

Yogendra
