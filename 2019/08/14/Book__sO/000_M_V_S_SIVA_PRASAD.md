Respected scholars,  
One of my friend requested for the e.book of Siva bhakta vilasa of Upamanyu in sanskrit. I failed to locate it.  
When I searched for it it came like that its in skanda upa puran. I dont know that there is a skanda upa purana.  
If you know any link for the siva bhakta vilasa in sanskrit by upamanyu then I request you to provide the link so that I can forward it to my friend who was interested to study.  
Thank you.
