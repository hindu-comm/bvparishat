Thank you for sharing this article which is very interesting. I read through the same and gained many insights into the philosophy of Bhaskara. I could not, however, decipher Bhaskara's view of Brahman, as to whether it is saguna or nirguna.  In the Br.su.bhashya 3.2.11, Bhaskara mentions nirguna brahma:

To me the context of this word does not appear to be in the purvapaksha; it is a statement made while elucidating the Bheda-abheda doctrine of Bhaskara. If there are any other indicators in any other study of Bhaskara where his idea of Brahman as nirguna or saguna, one could perhaps make a more firm conclusion.

  

warm regards,
