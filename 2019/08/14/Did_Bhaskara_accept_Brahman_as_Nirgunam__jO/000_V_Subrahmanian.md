Bhaskara who is admitted to have lived during the times of Shankara, propounded the bhedaabheda doctrine. I would like to know if Brahman of his doctrine is nirgunam like that of Shankara.

  

There is a pdf of his bhashya available. But there is no searchable version, as I know. Also, is there any list of the citations from shruti/smriti made in his bhashya?

  

Any pointers to the above are welcome.

  

Thanks and warm regards
