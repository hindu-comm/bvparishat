Upon a search, here
<https://books.google.co.in/books?id=ErMRGiNcxJIC&pg=PA280&lpg=PA280&dq=bhaskara+nirguna+brahman&source=bl&ots=dCemBszkvc&sig=ACfU3U0lRBdb-OoQNuyY-QfBt4Cc9wZVKQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwierMz07YTkAhVFK48KHUmgCjYQ6AEwEHoECAcQAQ#v=onepage&q=bhaskara%20nirguna%20brahman&f=false>

  

the bookGlobal History of Philosophy: The period of scholasticismBy John C. Plott, James Michael Dolin, Russell E. Hatton, on page 280 'But for Bhaskara, Brahman is always to be interpreted as Saguna Brahman...' and on p 283 we see for Bhaskara 'Brahman is never free from the three gunas....'  A book of ...Sinha is cited by the author/s.

  

This gives me the idea that Bhaskara did not accept Brahman to be nirguna.
