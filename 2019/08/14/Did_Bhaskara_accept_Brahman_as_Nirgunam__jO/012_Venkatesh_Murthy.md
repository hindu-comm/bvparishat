Namaste

  

Why Bhakara's philosophy is not popular today with no followers?

Answer - 'it may be because the tenets of his system were more subtly elaborated in succeeding centuries by the Visistadvaita in South India and by the Saiva systems in Kashmir'

From paper sent by Professor Deshapande.

  

Visistadvaita Philosophy has borrowed heavily from Bhaskara. Satyatva of world and accepting Parinama Vaada are important points in common.
