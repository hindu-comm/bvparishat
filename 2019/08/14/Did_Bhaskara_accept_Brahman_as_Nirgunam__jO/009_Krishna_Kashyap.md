Namaskar,

  

There are different schools of thought. We cannot deny that. Hence each school of thought has a different view on this concept of Nirguna.

  

If you totally accept and believe in Advaita, Brahman is Nirguna. There is no doubt about that. Other schools of thought bitterly argue against this view. It is a job of the reader to figure things out and get a strong conviction one way or the other.

There are even schools that are atheistic. They deny anything permanent. It depends on what a reader accepts and comes to terms with.
