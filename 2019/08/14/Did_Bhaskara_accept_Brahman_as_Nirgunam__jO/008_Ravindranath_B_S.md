Sir,

 Why we need to depend on the earlier writing with so many confusions, is it so difficult to the present day scholars to qualify that Brahman is nirguna or saguna,

This book from PN Srinisvasachari is a good one. It is an indepth assessment of Bhaskara's position. Bhaskara rejects "nirguna brahman". For him Brahman is always saguna.

though it may be nirAkAra.

see some excepts from this book:
