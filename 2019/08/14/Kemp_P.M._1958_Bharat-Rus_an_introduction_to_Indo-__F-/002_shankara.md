Shankara ji would have to pronounce the final opinion, but I don't see  
this book anywhere on major servers. I can fill in an interlibrary  
loan request, since there is a copy at the British Library, but that  
can sometimes take over a week to arrive. Plus, I'm away until the  
23rd or 27th and won't be able to scan it until then.  
Please let me know your decision.  
  
Irene
