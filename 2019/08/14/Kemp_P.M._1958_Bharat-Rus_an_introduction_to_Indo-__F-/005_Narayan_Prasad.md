\<\<Do you still require a scan?>\>

  

One of my friends working at Delhi informed me that although the catalogue indicated the availability of the book, the book itself could not be traced on the rack.

So, if possible from your side, I would definitely like to get a scanned copy of the book.

Thanks and regards

Narayan Prasad
