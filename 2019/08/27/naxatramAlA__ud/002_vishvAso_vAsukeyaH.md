अत्र मम कश्चन प्रस्तावः। Let the asterisms (groups of stars) be projected on to the ecliptic along the longitudes of the ecliptic coordinate system dating back to 1500 BCE. Then, can the ecliptic be paritioned into 27/ 28 equal parts so that each part contains atleast one projected (part) of the asterism with which it is identified?
