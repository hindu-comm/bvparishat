**Identification of Vaidika Nakṣatras:** I have shared previously the work we are doing at CAHC on ancient Indian knowledge traditions with focus on Natural Sciences. A typical question many visitors to our Centre ask is: How to identify the ancient system of Nakṣatras (N) in the sky. Siddhantic texts give some information using the Yogatāra concept. However if we go to the Vedāṅga period, there is no unique description, but the 27 (or 28) N were **visible** with (1,2,3,..6) stars. N’s have two identities: First as visible stars groups; secondly in association with moon, they stand for Time. As late as 14^(th) cent.CE Vidyāmādhavīya says: *muhūrtastārakāmayaḥ.* Perhaps by that time calculations had largely overtaken observations. But in the ancient period N’s were unequally spaced. How they helped time measurement by movement of moon is yet to be investigated. *Vṛddhagārgīya Jyotiṣa* (VGJ) manuscript contains information that may help unravel some unanswered questions. The fourth Chapter of VGJ named *Nakṣatrakarmaguṇāḥ*edited at CAHC is due for publication. This provides the number of constituent stars of the 27 N’s, which is similar to the Before Common Era texts such as the *Parāśaratantra, Śārdūlakarṇāvadāna, Sūrya-candra Prajñapti*, *Atharvapariśiṣṭa*, but somewhat different from the 6^(th) cent.CE *Bṛhatsamhitā*. A pictorial presentation of the 27 N’s as per VGJ has been prepared. This may be of help in identifying the ancient *nakṣatra* groupings in the present day sky. Note that the 27 N’s are made up of 83 stars.
