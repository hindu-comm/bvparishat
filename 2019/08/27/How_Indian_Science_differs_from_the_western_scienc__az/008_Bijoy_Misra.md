yogyatA is in the stanza I gave.

My question is to find the interpretation of the word from the literature if it exists.  

From its use, it looks like a generic technical word (but I do not know).

  

I connect the stanza of VP to the note I wrote in the beginning on sensing.  

Sensing in parts(chunks) is the biological function of the sense organs.
