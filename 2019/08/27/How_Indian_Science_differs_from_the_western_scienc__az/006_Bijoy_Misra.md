In the context of Bhatrhari the individual does not come in. Every object has a योग्यता.

The question is when was it discovered if you can trace?  

I know it is not easy. But checking if people did churn through check.

Bhatrhari has many such words which seem to have technical meaning.

Some he defines himself like शब्द. It must be a pre-Paninian word, and might have a definition.

  

I am more curious to the word आरोपित after observing the young scholar.
