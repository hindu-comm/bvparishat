Dear friends,

  

The title of the note might sound provocative, but I thought I wanted to draw  

attention of many of the young researchers and our politicians who seem to

think that science is competitive. These thoughts did arise while we were

doing our annual Bhagavadgita reading for Srikrishna Janmashtami last

Sunday. Let me explain.

  

The key phrase that attracted my attention was .इन्द्रियाणि इन्द्रियेभोः. The phrase

appears early in the book and repeats a few times throughout. To me this

becomes the definition of the scientist in Indian thought system. It is the distinction

between the information and the interpretation. This is where we break down the

information in its fundamental aspects and receive only the fundamentals.

  

The discovery of the Indian science is the enunciation of प्रज्ञा as an attribute in

human frame which is the receptor of the sensory information. It is different

from a processor which unfortunately dominates. गीता goes on analyzing the  

concept further as we move along and distinguishes between ज्ञान and विज्ञान.

  

The origin of Indian science and Indian thinking needs considerable analysis.

It has to do with a very early discovery that the universe is a field क्षेत्र, a contiguous

area, interconnected. This is fundamental because the universe is normally viewed

as objects as developed in western science. That the objects are manifestation in a

field did become a western concept only in the nineteenth century. It possibly

happened in India thousands of years ago.

  

Aristotle, the father of western science, did succeed in dissecting the object,

But for an Indian Scientist, no object exists in isolation. They tried to develop

various unified theories that we call दर्शन. All it succeeds in creating a thought

universe where the objects are only manifestations and are perishable.
Only the

इन्द्रिय sensing is permanent.  

  

Being confused with the intricacies of दर्शन, our British friends tried to reject

them to introduce object science. Object science is local in the world  

context, it creates more noise than knowledge. While our क्षेत्र has to be

limited in the new world, we have the same air, water and sun for the planet.

  

We cannot be local in our approach. Let me appeal all our fiends to dig

deep and appreciate the largeness of the Indian science and not be local through

cult or discipline. Please don't assert views. In our इन्द्रिय we have only one view.

We try to link to that view.

  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
