The field concept would not create science since we won't create any shapes.

the first shapes created out of the field is शब्द, the sound that can be interpreted.

  

Our friend Bhatrhari comes around 500AD or so to enunciate

  

इन्द्रियाणां स्वविषयेष्वनादिर्योग्यता यथा।  
अनादिरथैः शब्दानां संबन्धो योग्यता तथा॥ वाक्यपदीय ३ सम्बन्धसमुद्देशः २९

  

More follows there.  

  

Aryabhatta and Bhatrhari are "must read" for all in analytic science.
