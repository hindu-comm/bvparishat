\<\<Could you please give examples you had in mind of dative absolute in Russian?>\>

  

Sir, I read about "dative absolute in Russian" only very recently (only a few days ago). I have not collected examples from Radischev's work.

  

Here, Russian means old Russian (Old Church Slavonic). Here is a perfect example of dative absolute (Евангелие от Матфея 14:6):

"Дьни жє бывъшу рождьства иродова"

  

Here "Дьни" and "бывъшу" both are in the dative. "рождьства" and "иродова" both are in the genitive.

For detailed explanation, please see [here](https://www.languagesoftheworld.info/historical-linguistics/dative-absolute-demystified.html).

  

It has been translated in modern Russian as:

"Когда наступил день рождения Ирода"

  

This is a complete clause, not a small clause to be called an absolute construction.

  

I give here one example on which I raked my head for long time:

"Я пью и ем не для того только, чтоб быть живу" \["Путешествие" (1790:93); (1992:30)\]

  

Here, "живу" is in the dative case. Which modern Russian grammar can explain the dative form here?

  

During my revision of translation, I will try to collect a few examples.

  

Thanks and regards

Narayan Prasad
