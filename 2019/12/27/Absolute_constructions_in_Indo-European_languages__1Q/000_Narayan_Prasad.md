Dear Scholars,  
   Namaste.

  
   While translating Radischev's Russian novel "A Journey from St. Petersburg to Moscow" (1790), in a[reader's review](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3137805-a-journey-from-saint-petersburg-to-moscow.)(by Rebecka) I came across the term "dative absolute" in Russian.  
  \*QUOTE\*  
     First and foremost, and most incredible of all, there are absolute datives! Several of them! I really think it's a shame the absolute dative has not permeated colloquial Russian. As far as I can remember, it's a calque from Classical Greek's double genitive ... It's not an easy read. Because this is not actually Russian. This novel could be translated into Russian.  
  \*UNQUOTE\*  
  
And from the article "[Dative Absolute Demystified](https://www.languagesoftheworld.info/historical-linguistics/dative-absolute-demystified.html)" I came to know about absolute constructions in Indo-European languages in general:  
    (1) dative absolute - in Russian (Old Church Slavonic) and Gothic  
    (2) ablative absolute - in Latin  
    (3) accusative absolute - in Greek and German  
    (4) genitive absolute - in Greek  
    (5) locative absolute - in Sanskrit

    (6) instrumental absolute - in[Anglo-Saxon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_construction)  
  
     And we are quite conversant with the 'nominative absolute' in English, e.g. "The weather being fine, we all started."  
  
In Sanskrit, the locative absolute is भावलक्षणसप्तमी (P.2.3.37: यस्य च भावेन भावलक्षणम्).  
But in Kannada grammar work I came across the term "सतिसप्तमी".  
BTW, where does the term "सतिसप्तमी" occur in Sanskrit grammar?  
Regards

Narayan Prasad
