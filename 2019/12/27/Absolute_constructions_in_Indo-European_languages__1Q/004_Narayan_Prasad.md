\<\< For example, classicists have a tendency to impose on Russian (and Armenian - and Sanskrit, perhaps) features they have seen in Greek, often without stopping to absorb how these features are positioned within the fabric of the language itself.>\>  

  

Exactly this being the reason, Dr D.N.S. Bhat has written a Kannada grammar entitled "**ಕನ್ನಡಕೆ ಬೇಕು ಕನ್ನಡದ್ದೇ ವ್ಯಾಕರಣ**" (Kannada requires grammars of Kannada only), in which on page 15, section 1.3, he deals with "**ಕನ್ನಡದವಲ್ಲದ ಕನ್ನಡ ವ್ಯಾಕರಣಗಳು**" (Kannada grammars unrelated to Kannada).

  

\<\<I look forward to other examples you have come across during your translation.>\>

  

OK. I will try to collect them.

  

\<\<By the way, the book we discussed is in process.>\>

  

Thank you so much!

  

Regards

Narayan Prasad
