Thank you, Sir.

  

My concern with such examples is that scholars, who have learned Russian from textbooks and have by necessity been exposed to a relatively small subset of the language, might be tempted to construct extensive theories based on meagre evidence. Just because there exist sentences likeМиша пришел домой попить чаю doesn't in itself mean that there is some special construction with dative.

  

For example, classicists have a tendency to impose on Russian (and Armenian - and Sanskrit, perhaps) features they have seen in Greek, often without stopping to absorb how these features are positioned within the fabric of the language itself. It might be possible to learn violin to an extent by going to a cello teacher, but a violin teacher is still better positioned to teach violin. We shouldn't forget that grammar arises out of the language, not the other way around. And language is passed between generations of living people.

  

I look forward to other examples you have come across during your translation. By the way, the book we discussed is in process.

  

Best wishes,

Irene
