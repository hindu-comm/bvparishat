Namaste

  

I am curious to know if nigrahasthanas are applicable to the Vaitandika. For example, if a Vaitandika uses multiple hetus or drstantas to refute his opponent's thesis, which can in fact be refuted by one single hetu or drstanta, would it amount to the 'adhika' nigrahasthana and defeat the Vaitandika?

  

Regards
