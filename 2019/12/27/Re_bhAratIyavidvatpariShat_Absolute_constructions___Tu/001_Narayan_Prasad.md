\<\<Like sati-saptamI, we get sataH- s"as"ThI too- for Locative Absolute and Genitive Absolute[resp.ly](http://resp.ly/).>\>

  

Thank you, sir, for this comment. Only a few days back I came across the term "सतः षष्ठी"[here](https://www.chitrapurmath.net/lessons/217/Lesson_71_____________________________________________________________), but that time I did not pay due attention to it.

  

We do have भावलक्षणषष्ठी (P.2.3.38: षष्ठी चानादरे), along with भावलक्षणसप्तमी (P.2.3.37: यस्य च भावेन भावलक्षणम्).

  

I came to know about the English terms "Locative Absolute" and the "Genitive Absolute" only very recently.

  

Thanks and regards

Narayan Prasad
