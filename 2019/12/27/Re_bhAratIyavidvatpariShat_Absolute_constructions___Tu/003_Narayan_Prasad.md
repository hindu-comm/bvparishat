\<\<Nice source for the two Absolutives>\>

  

From research point of view, the most detailed source that I have come across is the following:

"The Sanskrit Locative Absolute and its Syntactic Surroundings, ch.4, pp.127-171", in \[Antonia Ruppel\] [Absolute Constructions in Early Indo-European-2013](https://www.amazon.in/Absolute-Constructions-Indo-European-Cambridge-Classical/dp/0521767628)  

  

Regards

Narayan Prasad
