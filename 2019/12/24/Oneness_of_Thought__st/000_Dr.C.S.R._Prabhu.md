My stand and position of Oneness and a common Framework Dharma Yoga as ,common framework across all the major theistic Religions which I
maintained and presented (going to publish glibally as a book ) all these days is vindicated in this attached independent essay in Times of India Speaking Tree today 24 Dec 2029 Christmas Eve .Note that the Islamic Theology in the Quran was and is largely the same as the then contemporary Monotheistic Christian Theology minus the Trinity model ,same as it as prevalent in the middle east at that time of birth of Islam .Thus we have the Origin and Convergence of both the Christian or lslamic Monotheistic Theologies in yo the Upanishadic Oneness which finally was interpreted as Advaita.
