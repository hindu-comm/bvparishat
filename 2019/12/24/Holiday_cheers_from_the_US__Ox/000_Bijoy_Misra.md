Friends,

Last September we had invited a ballet troupe SAPTAVARNA from Bhubaneswar

who presented a majestic performance under the direction of Guru Padmasri Aruna

Mohanty of Orissa Dance Academy. Seven teachers in seven Indian classical dance  

styles made a fusion choreography to tell a story on the transit of the sun in the sky

under the title सूर्यस्नात and a second one on the theme of श्रीमद्भगवद्गीता. The program

was highly laudable.

I have invited the lead dancer of the troupe to present a complimentary performance  

as a New Year's tribute to our town. Do join if any of you would happen to be around

in the area, Be our guests.

Best regards.

Happy Holidays.

Bijoy Misra
