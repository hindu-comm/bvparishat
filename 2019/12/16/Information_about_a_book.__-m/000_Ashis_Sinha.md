Sir,  

  I shall be grateful if you kindly help me by giving an information about whether Ekavali of Vidyadhara  with annotation/translation in Hindi/English is available and how I may get one copy of the same preferablythrough internet or from market. The information will come to my immense help.

Thanking all of you a lot,

                                   
                Yours sincerely,

                                   
                Ms. S. Sinha.
