Dear Shri Balasubramanian ji:

  

"Tamil smArta-s also recite two nyAsa-s - pa\~ncA\~Nga-rudra-nyAsa and the pa\~nca-mukha-nyAsa, which they call rAvaNoktam, before the one elaborated by bodhAyana."

  

Are you here referring to the nyasa for Gayatri in sandhyavandana?

Panchanga would imply the nyasa on trinetra is omitted?

Can you please give sources for this please?

I keep learning new things about my own hoary tradition.

Any idea why Bodhayana changed the defacto?

Not related to the main question, but is there a fixed source on the minimum nyasa required for Gayatri Japa?

  

Many thanks,

  

Regards,

  

Venkat
