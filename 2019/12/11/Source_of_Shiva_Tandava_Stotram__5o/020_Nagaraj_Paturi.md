The famous Sivamahimna stotram is mentioned invariably to be composed by Pushpadanta, a gandharva.

  

My pitrpaada, a sakalas'aastrapaarngata traditional scholar proposed his thesis with overwhelming evidences that this Pushpadanta is none other than Katyayana Vararuchi, one of the munitraya of the Vyakarana shaastra.

  

I shall soon share the evidences.
