Dear Shri Paturi Garu,

  

You bring a valid point regarding Ravana being mentioned in third person, but since we have no sample of Ravana's authentic works atleast in public view, we dont know what his "mudra" was.

  

Shri Thyagaraja refers to himself in the third person in his Krithis.. "Thyagaraja sannuta.." (Although in his case it can be argued that he was referring to the Deity of Thiruvarur Thyagaraja Swami)

  

One sees a similar quirk in the works of other Bhakti poets "Tulasidas sadaa hari chera" "Tuka maNe" "Kahat Kabir" and so on...I think someone started this and everyone has been following this form ever since.. ;-)

  

Regards,

  

Venkat
