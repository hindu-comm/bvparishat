Namaste,

  

There was a great veera-shaiva saint & siddha yogi by nameरेवण सिद्ध योगी. He was great shiva bhakta. May be, he might have putरावण: (दशग्रीवः) to conceal his identity.

  

And, in due course of time, due to semantic changes, it came to be known as रावण: of rAmAyaNa fame.

  

It's purely my guess..

  

rgs,

sriram
