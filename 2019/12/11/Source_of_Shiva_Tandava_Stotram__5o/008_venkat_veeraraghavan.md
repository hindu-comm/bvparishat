Dear Shri Madhav ji  

  

There may as you say have been other Ravana(s) but how do we fix which one it is? You have to agree it is not a very common name though. I expect there are not a lot of people named "Judas" especially post the age of the literature that brings up the negative references.

Human nature it would seem is pretty uniform across race..:)

  

Its interesting that you brought up Nanda's minister Rakshasa ..I was reminded of the Chandragupta Maurya serial where the costume designers had a unique "look" planned for "amaatya" Rakshas as they called him ... ;-)

Check him out if you have the time..for laughs if for nothing else.

  

Interestingly Malana village and similar villages away from normal "civilisation" around the Hidimba mandir in Himachal speak a language called Rakshasi.

  

Kind Regards,

  

Venkat
