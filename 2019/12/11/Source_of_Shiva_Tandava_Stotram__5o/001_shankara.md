Venkat ji,

  

Please find attached VS Agrawala's paper on Sivatandavastotra. He makes following observations.

  

1\. This stotra does not form part of any Purana.  

2\. Its composition may be the work of some brilliant poet of the Rashtrakuta age in Deccan in 8th century CE.  

  

regards  
shankara
