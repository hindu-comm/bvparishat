Dear Smt Irene Ji  

  

No issues at all. I learnt something new from your post about the Hebrew origins of Judas' name. Afterall they were all Jews weren't they? Including the main man?

  

Pink Panther is too subtle for me. I prefer Tom and Jerry. I used to root for Jerry when I was younger. Now that I have grown older and (hopefully) wiser(?) I realise that Jerry carries pathogens and is not as "cute" or dignified in real life.

I prefer to watch Tom beat Jerry with the house-owner's saucepan.

Old-school but very effective.

  

Regards,

V
