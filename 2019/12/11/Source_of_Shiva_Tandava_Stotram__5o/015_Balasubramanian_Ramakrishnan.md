There is/was a rAvaNa-bhAshya on the vaisheShika-sUtra-s known as the kaTandI, but I have not heard of a Vedic-bhAshya. Information from Matilal's book on nyAya-vaisheShika literature is attached. It's notable that vaisheShika-s consider Siva as their Adi guru. Tamil smArta-s also recite two nyAsa-s - pa\~ncA\~Nga-rudra-nyAsa and the pa\~nca-mukha-nyAsa, which they call rAvaNoktam, before the one elaborated by bodhAyana. Ravana could have been considered a reasonable name in those times.
