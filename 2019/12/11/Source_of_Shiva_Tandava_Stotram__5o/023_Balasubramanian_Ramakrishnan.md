Thank you Prof. Deshpande. It's interesting, but I do wonder if Haug got confused by the rAvaNa-baiTha, which according to Aithal's bibliography exists for both the Rg and the Krishna-yajur veda-s in manuscripts. In some sense they wouldaid understanding of the texts, but wouldn't be a bhAShya. Gonda does not mention this bhAShya in his book in the History of Indian Literature series.
