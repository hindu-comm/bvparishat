Disputed authorship is widely present in current understanding of the past, what however is not clear is the reason for this, unless there was a desire to pervert the meaning of a text. There is an existing issue about the authorship of the Srimad Bhagavatam too which is frequently attributed to Vopa Deva. But still the motives remain unclear or maybe the people at present are not reading the past correctly.
