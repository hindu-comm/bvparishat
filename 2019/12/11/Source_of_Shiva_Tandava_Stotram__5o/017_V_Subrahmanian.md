This information is interesting. Are there any textual evidences like mangala shloka, etc. on this in their texts? Does Nyaya also adopt this aspect of VaisheShika? It is notable since this extremely ancient Aastika darshana has Siva as their Aadi Guru. Do they hold this deity as their 'Ishwara', the nimitta kaaraNam for the jagat, as well?
