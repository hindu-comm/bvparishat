This is the bodhAyanoktam mahAnyAsam I am talking about. You can find it in the gRhya parishiShTa describing rudrAbhiShekham. The sUtras are available on [archive.org](http://archive.org). A simple search should get it for you. Bodhayana did not change anything - he gave a procedure. But Tamil smartas add 2 things in front which they call rAvaNoktam. If you can read Tamil please see attachment (Footnote) from the vaidikavardhini publication on mahAnyAsam.

  

Subbuji, the vaisheShika school was generally shaivite - this is not disputed. Ravana’s bhAshya is lost. If you need other publication details, please consult Matilal’s book.
