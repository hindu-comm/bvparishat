Dear Shri Shankara ji,  

  

Thanks for the paper.

  

One thing that doesn't make sense to me is this:

1\. Why would any poet even a bad one, even one just starting out put Ravana's name on his creation?

The opposite has happened as in the case of Dharmi taking Shiva's poem to the King of Madurai (periapuranam) ... it is hard to believe anyone would put someone else's name on an obviously brilliant piece of work!

  

My 2 cents

  

Kind Regards,

  

Venkat
