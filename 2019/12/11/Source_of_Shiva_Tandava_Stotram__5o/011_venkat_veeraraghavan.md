Dear Smt Irene ji,  

  

I was makinga comment about human nature that tends to avoid certain names post certain seminal works..It is entirely possible as you say for other people with similar names to have existed during that epoch, but afterwards people being what they are tend to go "with the flow"..

The rise of names like Jude nowadays comes in two segments of people 1. The clueless "religious" people much like modern "Hindus" who name their child "Vihaan" etc.. and 2. The counter culture that rose in modern times as a way of cocking a snook at the church.

I am willing to bet as the Church got stronger, Judas was a very uncommon name (although auspicious as you point out) in Christian controlled territory..

  

The reason why I mentioned Malana-Rakshasi-isolated before is that when mainstream mixing happens people tend to gravitate towards a common "culture" / "hive mind" --path of least resistance call it what you might so that they can "blend in".

When a culture purposely keeps themselves secludedfrom mainstream society they have a better chance of "following their own drum beat"...Also with a language/dialect called Rakshasi..it would not be uncommon to name a child "Rakshasa"..that bit was meant as a segue to Dr. Deshpande mentioning Rakshasa who was Nanda's amaatya.

Apparently I swallowed all the detail and embraced brevity in the spirit of Sanskrit Grammarians. I tell you all this sangha is rubbing off on me!

  

;-)

  

Regards,

  

Venkat
