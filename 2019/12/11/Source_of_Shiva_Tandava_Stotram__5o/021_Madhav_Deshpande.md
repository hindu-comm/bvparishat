Dear Shri Ramakrishnan,

  

  On p. iv of his introduction to his translation of the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, Martin Haug refers to a Rāvaṇa-Bhāṣya:

"The so-called KauśikaBhāṣya is said to bemoreancient than that of Sāyaṇa, and also the Rāvaṇa Bhāṣya. Both

are said to be still extant, but Ihave not yet been able to obtain copiesof them."
