Namaste

  

Nice idea. But there is also a caution. Vidya should be given to deserving persons only. If he gives Vidya to undeserving person he becomes sinful.

  

इ**दमथर्वशीर्षमशिष्याय**** न देयम् ।**  
यो यदि मोहाद्दास्यति स पापीयान् भवति ।  
सहस्रावर्तनाद्यं यं काममधीते तं तमनेन साधयेत् ॥१४॥  

  

Many people from older generation think if they cannot find deserving person it is better to die and let the Vidya die with them. Any comments?
