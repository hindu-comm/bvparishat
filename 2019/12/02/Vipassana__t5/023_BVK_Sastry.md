Namaste



1. Misra ji: I agree with your observation \< Revolution in Indology is badly called for! \>



2. RS : I agree with you on the observation \< Things are not that simple \> ; 



2a) May I request you to clarify your position on the statement: \< Pali has a strong influence on Vedic Sanskrit (Chandas)>
; 

\< Pali.... rests with the language of the holy texts of Zarathustism, the Avesta \> .

\< Pāli goes back to a Vedic vernacular situated most probably (south-)east of Arachosia near the Bolan pas>


\< Pāli, however, as we know it, is basically a language of western lndia, as the edicts of Aśoka \[...\] clearly show.>



Inscriptions provide only a very minor percentage of vocabulary of language (spoke, literary, ritual, religion-discourse). Vocabulary in inscription does not help to build the total grammar of language!



2b) I would like to see a separation on 'History of Languages' in a parallel lane with ' Language -Grammar/ Languages -relation by derivation and influences' debate.

Indian understanding of Language-relations and modeling for the two scenarios are different for :

- (2a-1) Samskruth: Chandas and Bhashaa

- (2a-2) Bhashaa - (Prakruts/ Apabrhamsha/ Mleccha/ Desi) are totally out of synch with Western/ indology/ Oriental models.



 The western scholars have trimmed and force fitted (Vedic/ Bharateeya/ Brahmi ) languages history at India on a hypothesis : Samskruth was not native to India; So is the

language family of Pali . 



 The issue can be resolved only when the Indian model of languages of Brahmi family from Buddha /Mahaveer ( circa 700 BCE) backwards, through Vyasa ( 3100 BCE) and beyond till Valmiki (circa 6000 BCE) gets studied objectively in the total backdrop of ancient Civilizations, spread of Buddhism from India, and global imprints of Vedic Civilization. Till then, all views as quoted remains ' one more view from a scholar', respectfully to be noted and reviewed. Un-established data as foundation for forceful conclusions can not be a valid logic.
