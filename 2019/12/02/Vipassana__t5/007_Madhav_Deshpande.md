Dear Professor Kannan,

  

  You have raised important questions, but the answers are not easy to come by. It is true that Mahāvīra and Buddha were almost contemporary and both came from the region of Magadha, and hence must have spoken languages from that region. Indeed, the Jains call their Prakrit Ardhamāgadhi, while the Pali tradition calls its language Māgadhī. However, there is no hard core linguistic evidence available to us contemporary with Mahāvīra and Buddha. The Prakrit dialects seen in Aśoka's inscriptions do not exactly match either with Ardhamāgadhī or with Pali. Pali has linguistic features that do not match any other Prakrit known to us, and it is generally believed that the Pali tradition was transported to Sri Lanka from the region of Maharashtra/Gujarat, but it does not agree with Prakrits known from this region. Anyway, whatever the Indian regional dialect that is at the basis of Pali, it is not recorded anywhere in India, either in inscriptions or in literature. While some Buddhist traditions like the Sarvāstivāda are preserved in Sanskrit, it is not clear how old the use of Sanskrit is in the history of these traditions. The Sanskrit of the oldest Sarvāstivāda Āgamas looks like it is a Sanskritized version of some earlier Prakrit, but they are not directly Sanskrit translations of the Pali canon. The Sarvāstivāda tradition shows no awareness of the Pali tradition. In later Buddhism in India, as in later Jainism, the authors used perfectly standard Sanskrit and even wrote many grammars of Sanskrit. However, the Pali tradition in Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia did not render its scriptures into Sanskrit, and there is no evidence that they communicated with Buddhist traditions in India using Sanskrit.
