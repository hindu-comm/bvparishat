Dear Roland,

You are again talking like a religious scholar and not

an objective researcher. I have been seeing the language

literature for the past twenty years. They are all built on  

premise which do not have analytic foundation. You may  

send me any paper on the origin of Pali that is analytic  

from the first principles. "It is widely believed" does not  

make a scientific statement!
