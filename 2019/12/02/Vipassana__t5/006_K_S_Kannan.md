Weren't the Buddha and Mahavira, both from royal families, close enough spatially and temporally?

Didn't Pali survive even in Burma which must then have been a natural part of India?

Though called Myanmar now, did Burma have any other name in the past?  

And didn't Chinese travellers encounter Pali texts anywhere, else than Ceylon?

Did Sanskrit provide, then, a common platform to the many competing schools?
