Roland,

Statements don't make facts. Some scientific humility is gravely desired.

In general I am disappointed with the enunciation statements as we see

in religious texts. I have not studied where these statements arise form.  

"We don't know" or "We believe to be" or "There is likelihood" are possible  

statements from an information point of view. I talk "scholarly" does not

make me a scholar. Correlation is not science! People must learn to be

quantitative, appreciate statistics and sampling. Revolution in Indology

is badly called for! A good grinding in Mahalanobis or Shannon is a  

requirement!
