\> 'one more view from a scholar', respectfully to be noted and  
\> reviewed. Un-established data \[...\]  
  
In fact, it is an introductory summary of the current state of  
research with a multitude of evidence, examples and references I  
skipped for the sake of brevity. Everyone is free to ignore it, but if  
one intends to criticize this state of research, one would first have  
to study it and try to understand it. This is arduous and takes time,  
but it is an indispensable prerequisite for a fruitful discussion.
