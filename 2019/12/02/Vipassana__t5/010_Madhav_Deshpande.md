Dear Radhakrishna Ji,

  

  More sound changes and morphological changes are seen to take place as one goes from Sanskrit \> Pali \> Prakrits \> Apabhraṃśa \> New Indo-Aryan languages. In that sense, Pali is linguistically closer to Sanskrit than Prakrits. How much of Pali technical terminology was consciously rendered from Sanskrit is not clear. That assumes that Pali speakers were fully conversant with Sanskrit and that they were consciously taking vocabulary from Sanskrit and introducing it into Pali. I doubt that for the earlier periods of Pali. For some of the medieval Pali poetic works produced in Sri Lanka, it is clear that the authors are fully conversant with Sanskrit, and in some cases, they are copying the wording of authors like Bāṇabhaṭṭa into Pali. But that may not be the case for the earlier canonical Pali. Literary Marathi going back to the earliest period, as in the works of Jñāneśvara, is seen to incorporate Sanskrit vocabulary without always putting it through Prakritic changes. But that does not seem to happen in Pali or Prakrits. In literary Pali and Prakrit works, the Sanskrit vocabulary is always transformed using the established rules. This is what we also see in the Prakrit used in the Sanskrit dramas. The canonical Pali, at least in the conversational dialogues, looks like a natural language.
The technical vocabulary in Vinaya and Abhidharma works possibly shows familiarity with Sanskrit, though all such words are phonetically normalized in Pali. In any case, this is a very interesting subject.
But it would be largely only a bold guess work to assert that a given word is not original to colloquial Pali and that it is definitely a borrowing from Sanskrit.
