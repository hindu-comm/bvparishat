Dear Irene.

  

The main issue is whether the sequencing of the letters for teaching the Sanskrit Script also served the purpose of instructing how to phonate letters of the Vedic/Sanskrit language.

  

It is important to understand that children learn to speak by picking up words and not individual letters of a language. In order that instruction of letters fall in line with the way children learn a language the individual letters need to be instructed in groups. This is exactly what Panini did through his Maheshwar Sutras.

  

However, while designing the script each individual letter was suffixed with each of the vowels to render क काकिकी ...... and so on mechanistically and thereafter they were instructed in the same order.
This to my mind was the main cause behind the deterioration of the Vedic tongue. The sequence of the plosive consonants (कखगघङ ...)was equally responsible.

  

To add to it these were then included in the shiksha granthas thus giving them sanctity for instruction. Thus the model of the script which was imposed on the shiksha is the main cause for Sanskrit losing its pristene form.

  

Once one is able to distinguish between the need of instructing the script and the instruction of how to phonate (shiksha) Sanskrit will again regain its past form as the following generations have deligently preserved its literature in letter though possibly not in spirit.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
