Namaste RS  
  
You seem to miss the point i was addressing. I do understand \< Things are  
not that simple \> ;  
  
If the 'Introductory summary' which is explicit and candid to show the line  
of later build up of text detailing, is based on 'DATA-DATE-AXIOMS-  
PERSPECTIVES' which have suspect elements, what would motivate one to go for  
further details in the text ?  
  
The excerpt provided was marked with highlight to show the 'SUSPECT-  
'DATA-DATE-AXIOMS- PERSPECTIVES' on Brahmi Language modeling, history,  
Internal connections of languages at Bharath  
.  
Can you please assure that the book has some illuminating evidence to  
address the 'suspect elements' and not a rehash of past views in a new  
bottle??  
  
  
Here below is the basis for my line of thinking.
