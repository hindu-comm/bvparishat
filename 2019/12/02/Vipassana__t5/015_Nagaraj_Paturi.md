The relation between Sanskrit and Prakrits including Pali is the relation between standard dialect / form and the regional and social dialects. Standard dialect /form of any language ( here, Sanskrit )

  

> 
> > 1\. is used in the entire area of the language ( here, in majority of > the Indic sub-continent) >
> 
> > 
> >   
> > 
> > 
> > 2\. is used uniformly throughout the area ( here, in majority of the > Indic sub-continent) >
> 
> >

> > 
> >   
> > 
> > 
> > 3\. does not change in time as fast as the dialects (here, Prakrits > including Pali ) >

The regional and social dialects (here, Prakrits including Pali )

  

> 
> > 1\. are used only in the respective regions and the respective social > classes only >
> 
> > 
> >   
> > 
> > 
> > 2\. have different forms from each other

> > 
> > 
> > 3\. change in time faster than the standard dialect / form.

We notice many movements today favoring /asking for the use of the regional or social dialects replacing the current standard form /dialect. These movements have regionalist or other social and/or political motivations. That is why the use of Prakrits including Pali by Buddhists and Jains is being interpreted as an activity with social and/or political motivations.

  

But the use of Pali by Buddhists and Jains need not be interpreted that way.
