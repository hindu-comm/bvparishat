On \< linguistics of Pali and Sanskrit ... reasons for the failure of Pali to maintain traction in Indiadue to the difference in contents handled mostlyin the two languages? .... Pali's thrust in Buddhism and Jainism and that of the Sanskrit in the Vedas? > :



*Some observations*: ( if not palatable an out of main stream, please excuse). 



a) *Language and Religion streak association* :



Language, irrespective of Samskruth, Pali, Prakrut, apabhramsha, Mleccha... survives in a society by serving a utility. That utility is dependent on the patronage of user community for that language.
Samskruth has survived over a period of time/ centuries due to the ' unquestioned faith/ trust/ belief' associated with this language for the benefits desired by user community. Best example : sensitivity for
articulate 'Swara purity' of Vedic Chant in user community is anchored to the faith ( - brahma loke maheeyate) and fear ( yathendrashatruh svartoparaadhaat). This has helped to preserve the 'sound-structure- sequence-flow' of Vedas . But the same level of sensitivity for 'meaning of the mantra ( -mantraartha) ' is not present in user community.

Net outcome: Perfection in guarding Vedic Chanting through voice-mode-articulation and deployment in Vidhi is supported unquestioned; any effort to change the 'swara' is resisted. CONTRA, the meaning of Veda-mantra is allowed to be plastically fluidly distorted; the support to guard the meaning of mantra (Veda) is minimal. The post colonial model indian support for Veda-preservation, till date, is a standing example for this. While Indian traditionalists have made every effort to guard 'Veda-(Shabda) Shareera', they have not matched their effort in guarding the ' Veda- (Artha/Atma)- Shareera'. 



The thrust in society for any specific language depends upon the community connect and Communication utility.

Buddhism and Jainism used social languages to deliver the Yoga- Practice Benefits. The practicality of ardha-magadhi, magadhi, desh bhashaa, prakrits served this need.

The same teams used Samskruth for writing their 'Shaastra' works. For the social language was not precise enough for this need. Buddhism and Jainism used social language as a foundation to bridge the path towards the Spiritual (Adhyatma-Yoga-bhashaa; techncially called the language technicality of the Suttas) language. The choice was based on the motive and purpose served. Over a period of time, the dynamics of languages of Prakruths changed. So the Pali-Prakruth end up as ' out of society/ locked to the seminary/ classical languages'. the new social model is 'Desha-bhashaa, Jati-bhashaa, kula-bhashaa'. Now a days, it is ' international cyber-bhahsaa, the english we are using to make this dialogue.



Vedic teams ( including Valmiki/ Vyasa paramparaa) was connecting the society to higher level of Rushi -paramparaa using the 'model of Chandas- Bhashaa' paradigm. The Bhashaa served as the bridge to get to Yoga/ Vak-yoga model of Samskrutham to have the vision of ' Chandas/ Mantra'. The yajna was a speciifc model of Yoga for providing this connect. The details are in aaranyaka. The social model of benefit through yajna is given in Shrauta and Gruhya sutras. the yoga models of yajna are given in Gita. So, the language of 'Bhasha' to get to
'Chandas' was Vedic teams model. The choice was based on the motive and purpose served.





b) On \< failure of Pali to maintain traction in India \> : The language did not fail. The society had a different dynamics to keep the language alive. If you look at the Indian languages itself, tenth century desi language models of Kannada, telugu, Tamil, Gurjari, Maharshtrian,..... does not work for 14th century; 17th century; 20th century. Same for english also. Shakespearean English does not work in 21 st century social media.

So, the language gets traction only when language user community is sensitive to the importance of language, work consciously and vigilantly to prevent language deterioration in education and usage. In other words, if one were to understand the strategy of colonial mindset to bring down the culture of target nation, the first goal was to take total control of ' language of community and language of religion of community'. No need to elaborate on this.

Pali was preferred at some point in india by rulers at India; and the position -control reverted to Samskruth. just a historic change. Now, neither Pali or Samskruth has any love left with Nations governance and user communities ! When user community highlights and supports only
social benefit/ job opportunity through language learning, and ignores the cultural/spiritual / religious benefits and connectivity to inheritance, the slide down of language begins. In present period, in the moving language-bus, english is in driving seat; rest of the languages are jam packed in the bus; and sanskrit -pali- prakruth are hanging by side rails of the moving bus. 



c) This situation can be rectified only by proactive interest and investment support to revive the language by practically demonstrating the ' social benefit of the language along side cultural benefit' right from early education through advanced studies. Post mortem of history helps; but will give the traction.
