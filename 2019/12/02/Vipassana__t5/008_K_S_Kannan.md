Dear Professor Deshpande,

Your answers open up many dimensions of the issues that are not easily perceived or discerned.

  

Almost concomitant interrogations and investigations could be on these lines:

The very appellation Samskrta apparently implies something raw or crude or elementary of which or upon and over which it bespeaks of a refinement and sophistication. All the same, the bulk of the vocabulary of Pali and the Prakrits bid fair to be simplifications if not atrophies (by the *as'akta-abhidhAtR*-s) of the ever rich Sanskrit vocabulary. It has been admitted by scholars in spite of themselves, as it were, that attempting to teach Pali to a student is more easy via Sanskrit (declensions and conjugations, for example), which all not only betray Sanskrit paradigms incessantly at work, but each individual vocable almost of these languages more or less reducible and deductible from actual finished Sanskrit forms, rather than getting built upon or evolving out of bases that can be conceived of or actually entertained in those very languages. Among others, Prof. VRaghavan spoke of Vedic vocables, rather than Sanskrit words, as sources or ancestors of numerous Pali words of which they are descendants (and as corroborated on even syntactical grounds and considerations). Whereas the process of prAkRtisation is evidently discernible - even within Vedic vocabulary even if not on any significant scale; and even in the realm of even the monosyllabic roots available in the various Dhatu-patha-s; is it also not a matter of no small wonder that these languages hardly became a good breeding ground for any cultivation or continuation of the innumerable sastra-s and disciplines that we countenance in Sanskrit?: it is as though the *desi* could hardly sustain itself except upon the succour and strength, nourishment and nexus dowered upon and showered by the *margi*? How does one account then for the vitality of Sanskrit, the sole pan-Indian language that could so generously nourish and cherish scores of languages through scores of centuries, even beyond the borders of India of whatever date? (To extrapolate and enunciate similar patterns and paradigms to the world of Western languages such as the Avestan or Greek or Latin would be to court adversarial comments in abundance, and not immediately very beneficial to the issue being discussed either, and so need not be pursued here). But then, how is all this explained?
