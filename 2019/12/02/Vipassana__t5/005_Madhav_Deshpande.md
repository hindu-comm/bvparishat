After the Pali tradition was transported to Sri Lanka during the time of Aśoka, it survived there and spread to countries of South East Asia, but there was almost no trace of it left in India. Buddhism in India continued in traditions expressed in Sanskrit, Gāndhāri, Prakrit, etc. but not in Pali. The Chinese travellers who visited India did not find any Pali traditions there, but some of them visited Sri Lanka and came to know of the Pali tradition. There are no quotations of or references to any Pali texts in the Buddhist Sanskrit texts written in India. The Jain texts are exclusively composed in India, and their authors were not in touch with the Pali tradition that survived in Sri Lanka. The Jains and the Buddhists in India were aware of each other's traditions that lived in the same regions. The existence of the Pali texts became known in India only during the colonial period, when the Pali texts began to be published and studied in European countries and in the newly established universities in India. The Devanāgarī editions of Pali texts is a relatively recent phenomenon, and they are all conversions from other scripts like the Singhalese and the Burmese or the Roman texts published by the Pali Text Society in London. The volumes of the Devanagari edition of the Tripiṭaka from Nalanda edited by Bhikkhu Jadadisa Kassapa give references on every page to Roman, Sri Lankan, Burmese and Thai editions and note textual variants found in these different versions.
