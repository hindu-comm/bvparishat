Dear Irene,

  

It is a problem of believing and maintaining that scripts brings permanance to a language. This is not true. Permanance comes by transferring speech from one generation to the next without blemish through the word of mouth. It is for this reason that shiksha lies at the foundation of the Vedas. Later grammarians who differed with the Ashtadhyayi did not give reasons for not concurring with Panini. Even Patanjali at places cited examples of the then contemporary usages to bring sanctity to his views. The most glaring is the inclusion of the ayogavaha letters. We have no other option but to believe that Panini composed the Ashtadhyayi to maintain the sanctity of the Vedas as well as of laukik Sanskrit. Only then can we say that words are like the Brahman. In nature too we find this in the form of an individual in a species lending its characteristics to the next generation through the process of procreation. The next generation is not only endowed with a body like his parents but also with a medium of communication with the members of his species on which the survival of the species depends.
This was and is the intention of Panini to compose the Ashtadhyayi.
Words can get permanance only if the letters in it are permanent to the human race and not to an individual.

  

On a lighter vein what would be the answer to the question how did the crows caw centuries ago? The answer surely is as they caw today.

  

The Maheshwar Sutras are just a presentation of all the universal speech forms of the human species.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
