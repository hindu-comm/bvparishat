Namaste,

  

Inquiry into the linguistics of Pali and Sanskrit is very interesting.Are the reasons for the failure of Pali to maintain traction in Indiadue to the difference in contents handled mostlyin the two languages?

  

Pali's thrust in Buddhism and Jainism and that of the Sanskrit in the Vedas?

  

Is it because that they eitherwent against or rejected the Vedas and hence found it difficult to take roots in India ?

  

When through 'vipassana' Buddha urged to live in the 'present', 'see things as it is' etc people found more sense and more compelling in Vedanta which had a more powerful living 'sampRadAya' (learning from a Guru who was not only 'shrotRiya'but a'Brahmanishta' too)that explained the TRUTH through the 'ShravaNa-manana-nidhidhyasana' using the support of scripture, logic and experience ?

  

Regards

  

Balagopal
