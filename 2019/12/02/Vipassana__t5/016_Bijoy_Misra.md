All,

I have two observations I wanted to share. (There is a massive snow storm here and I was busy otherwise).

  

1. There exist a whole host of folk-legends and literature in Odisha regarding the Kalinga's naval interaction with

 Srilanka (Simhala) during the period of Ashoka and before. It is believed that there was continuing cultural

 and trade relations between the regions including a historical statement that the early rulers in Ceylon might

 have been from Kalinga. I have heard of copper plates but have not looked or studied them.

  

2. Personally and as a matter of scientific exploration of oral communication, I have come to believe that the

 grammar of human speech is neurologically limited than acoustically limited. Hence analysis of audible

 sound to define communication should be considered a gross artificial construct. It is possible and probably

 true that the Paninian syllables are close approximations of the neurologically cognitive units of information  

 produced and conveyed by the humans. But the diction, the analog continuity and the intent of complete  

 delivery carry a biological grammar from the point of view of information processing. In this context the old  

 oral languages including the Vedic would have more naturalness of expression than the later grammatical

  constructs used for literary comprehension. The movement of sound from communication has possibly to

 be constructed from the first principles of basic neurology. A sound's cognitive meaning could be more  

 primitive than we are given to understand. I lately saw such enunciation in Bhatrhari but he does not mention

 of any older philosophers on the topic. Scholars who are into Mimamsa might help educate.

  

On a side note, snow is continuing.

  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
