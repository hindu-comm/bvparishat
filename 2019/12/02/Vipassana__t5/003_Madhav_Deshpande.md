Just to add a note to Dr. Bhat's comments, Hemacandra's Prakrit grammar does not cover Pali. This is the case of all other Prakrit grammars.
The existence of Pali was unknown to the Prakrit grammarians, and the Pali grammars, all of them written in Sri Lanka or Burma, show no awareness of any other Prakrit languages. The word "vipaśyanā" \[parallel to Pali vipassanā\] is found in the Buddhist Sanskrit literature, which shows numerous words that are Sanskritized forms of some earlier Prakrit base. However, the Pali texts themselves were not converted to Sanskrit by the Buddhists. Only in modern times, there are some Sanskrit renderings of Pali texts like the Dhammapada \[by scholars like Rahul Sankrityayan\]. In northern India, Buddhist texts existed in multiple languages including, Sanskrit, Prakrit and Gāndhārī, and there are references to Apabhraṃśa versions. While the Buddhist Sanskrit texts are available in great quantity, there are only rare samplesof texts available in Gāndhārī and Prakrit.
