Thank you Prof. Deshpande ji for you clarifications. And thank you Dr. Kannan for your further notes.

  

"All the same, the bulk of the vocabulary of Pali and the Prakrits bid fair to be simplifications if not atrophies (by the *as'akta-abhidhAtR*-s) of the ever rich Sanskrit vocabulary." 

  

Whatever little Sanskrit I know (mostly words, not grammar) is because I know Malayalam and studied my mother tongue in school. With my very limited knowledge, it appears to me that many technical terms used in Pali and the various other Prakrits are probably created from Sanskrit through well established rules of "atrophy". These rules might have been based on natural evolution of the language such as say, the natural evolution of a Prakrit word "akkhi" from an earlier "akshi" for eye. In short, technical terms might not have been naturally occuring words in the Prakrits but created from Sanskrit words using the rules of "atrophy", that is, the rules of natural evolution observed in naturally occuring words. 

  

Here is a question. This is not about just individual words or technical terms, but about the language itself. If we just reverse the atrophy of words, can we obtain Sanskrit from Pali and other Prakrits without any profound changes in grammar or sentence structure? Modern Indo-Aryan (say Hindi or Gujarati) has evolved so much that this process is not possible even after removing all non-Indic words, i.e., you cannot get Sanskrit from pure Hindi or pure Gujarati by just reversing the atrophy, or natural evolution of words. But is this possible with Pali or other Prakrits?

  

Regards,

Radhakrishna Warrier
