Dear Vidwans,

  

How did the evolution of script influence/affect the continuous deterioration of Vedic Sanskrit?

  

What were the causes for Vedic Sanskrit to lose their metrical beauty or why subsequent literature could not be composed in Vedic meter?

  

Surely the shift of composing or writing literature from poetry to prose must have been on account of a shift in phonation of letters of Vedic Sanskrit in the commoners.

  

Panini's Maheshwar Sutras are the only window through which we can peep into the way ancients phonated words. We cannot reconstruct the way in which the ancients recited the Vedas with the help of what has come down to us in written form nor can we rely on the recitation presently practiced in various pathashalas throught India as there is lack of uniformity in their recitation. One of the possible reasons for the evolution of various schools of recitation during the time of Patanjali is the lack of a common code of instruction of letters of the Vedic or Sanskrit language as well as holding a view that the Maheshwar Sutras were solely composed for the sake of abbreviations to be used in the Ashtadhyayi. It is obvious that the Maheshwar Sutras nay the whole Ashtadhyayi carries the mark of the way Panini might have been speaking Sanskrit or reciting the Vedas. The rest is pure speculation however much one may try to bring forth written evidence.

  

The beauty of Vedic Sanskrit lies in its natural rhythm which was subsequently lost in apabransha languages. When letters in words go out of tune with natural rhythm they tend to transform a language into a new one over a couple of generations.

  

One can refer to my posts on Barakhadi Sutras which are set in rhythm.

  

The acceptance of the Devnagari Script letters as a standard for instruction of Sanskrit Shiksha by Shishtas is at the root of the continuous changes that started taking place in subsequent languages in India as well as leading to the corruptions that entered into Sanskrit.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
