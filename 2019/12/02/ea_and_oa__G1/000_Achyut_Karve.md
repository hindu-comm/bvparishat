Dear Vidwans,  
  
Why are ऍ as in arrange and ऑ as in auction not used as vowels in the Sanskrit language though they are seen to be widely used in other languages.  
  
Can this be considered a distinctive feature of Sanskrit? or Do the above vowels lack something that prevented them from being used in Sanskrit?  
  
With regards,  
Achyut Karve.
