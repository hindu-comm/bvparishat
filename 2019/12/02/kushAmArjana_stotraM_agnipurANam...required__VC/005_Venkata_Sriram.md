Yes Murthy Garu...Thank you for your kind wishes and concern. A doctor from Apollo is attending...

  

Our teacher is of 85 years age and still does trikAla-sandhya at proper time without fail. Even during the attack of Pneumonia, he is getting up at 5:00 AM in morning for ablutions by doing bhasma-snAna (applying vibhuti).

  

He is a source of inspiration for me....

  

यद्यदाचरति श्रेष्ठस्तत्तदेवेतरो जनः।स यत्प्रमाणं कुरुते लोकस्तदनुवर्तते  

  

rgs,

sriram
