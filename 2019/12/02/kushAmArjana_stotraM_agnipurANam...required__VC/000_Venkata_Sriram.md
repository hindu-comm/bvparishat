Namaste Scholars,

  

My sanskrit teacher is unwell and he want's to chant theकुशामार्जन स्तोत्रं fromअग्निपुराणम् for speedy recovery.

He has got mild attack of Pneumonia followed by respiratory problem.

  

I have searched online but unable to trace out.

  

Request you all to kindly help..Devanagari or telugu script is fine for me.

  

Thanking you in advance.

  

rgs,

sriram
