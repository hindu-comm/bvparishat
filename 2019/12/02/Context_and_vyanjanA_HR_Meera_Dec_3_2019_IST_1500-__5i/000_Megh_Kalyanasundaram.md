**Abstract**:

The primary deciding element in ascertaining non-literal sense in any linguistic transaction is, in fact, the context of the utterance. However, context is not a monolith that can be pinned down with specifics with any certainty but is, in reality, a dynamic entity that evolves as the interaction progresses. It is a multi-layered, complex entity, which requires systematic “peeling of the layers” as it were, to study how it works. Context has been discussed both in traditional śāstra-s and in contemporary linguistic studies. In this talk, we will work through a sample of how context contributes to meaning-making – when, for example, a proverb is used in a conversation – using the frameworks of Cognitive Linguistics and Vyañjanā vṛtti for the analysis.
