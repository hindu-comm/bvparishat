Nagarajji,

I did meet him in Bhubaneswar in the summer.

His immersion in the cultural tradition of Odisha is refreshing and inspiring.

I am glad that he came to the Yatra conf.

He studies the prosody in Odia poetry by visiting remote villages.

Please support him and enable him to cultivate further.  

We need to explore the the physics of prosody from the point of view of expression and human speech..

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
