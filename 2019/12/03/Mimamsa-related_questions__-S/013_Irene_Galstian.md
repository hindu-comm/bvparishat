Sir,  
  
I gladly would have shared, but I don't know where to look for this  
work. Clearly it exists, since it's been specifically recommended to  
Sri Rishi Goswami, but I can't find it in the Rashtriya Sanskrit  
Sansthan's catalogues to try to purchase it, and I can't find it in  
library catalogues to try the interlibrary loan route. Yet, anyway.  
  
Best wishes,  
Irene
