I'm not sure of all questions but for a beginners guide, you should start reading Artha Sangraha and Mimamsa Paribhasha.

Prof. V N Jha of this group has published many Dvds of which these 2 are available for buying. You and I both are looking for a dictionary and I found one.  
Purva Mimamsa Laghukosha. I saw the reply today and am willing to buy it.

Thanks
