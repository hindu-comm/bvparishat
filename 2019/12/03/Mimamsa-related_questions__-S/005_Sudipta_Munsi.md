Dear Dr. Irene Galstian,

  

The Arthaloka commentary by Mm. Pt. Pattabhirama Sastri on Arthasamgraha, published by Chowkhamba, is extremely useful. Also, Pt. Pattabhirama Sastri's original work, Mimamsanayamanjari in 2 parts, published by Sampurnanand Sanskrit University, Varanasi, is very useful - it gives lucid summary of Mimamsadarsana chapter by chapter and adhikarana by adhikarana, although the second volume closes with the 8th chapter of Mimamsadarsana. Both the volumes contain extremely useful appendices on a very brief overview of the Bhatta system and a step by step description of some basic Vedic rituals which are dealt with in Mimamsa.

  

Mm. Pt. Anantakrsna Sastri's extremely useful but little-read work, Mimamsasastrasara, originally written as an introduction to his edition of Khandadeva's Bhattadipika, can also be profitably consulted.

  

Mm. Dr. Mani Dravid Sastri's Sanskrit elucidation on Parthasarathi Misra's Sastradipika (Tarkapada), with a gist of the elucidation in English prepared by Dr. Sharda Narayanan is an excellent guide to learning Mimamsa.

  

Prof. Vacaspati Upadhyaya's Mimamsadarsanavimarsa is a very useful work in Sanskrit.

  

As for secondary materials in English, I'd recommend Mm. Sir Dr. Ganganatha Jha's two classical works, Purvamimamsa in its Sources and The Prabhakara School of Purvamimamsa. Dr. Pashupatinath Sastri's book, An Introduction to Purvamimamsa, is also a good introductory book. Among modern scholars working on Mimamsa, Dr. Elisa Freschi has written a number of very important papers; she has particularly explored the somewhat negected Prabakara sub-school of Mimamsa. Many articles of hers can be downloaded from her page on [academia.edu](http://academia.edu)Also her edition and English translation of Ramanujacarya's Tantrarahasya, a late Prabhakara Mimamsa work, published by Brill, is a major contribution to Mimamsa studies in recent times.

  

Best regards,

Yours sincerely

  

Sudipta Munsi
