Dear Dr Sudipta Munsi,

  

Thank you so much for this annotated bibliography!

I'll follow this up but might trouble you again regarding publisher details if library catalogues don't show these works. I'm not talking about Ganganath Jha's works, which are very famous, but about the newer publications which might be under the radar of purchasing departments of university libraries.

  

Best wishes,

Irene
