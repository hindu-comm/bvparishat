As you know from earlier announcements, Prof Aklujkar's BORI course is ongoing - and it's a wonderful experience.

As I'm interested in Bhartrhari because of my curiosity about Yaska, I had questions on Mimamsa saved up to ask. However, asking questions during the lecture is an option more for in-audience participants than remote participants, and so I thought I'd post my questions here instead.

  

1\. Could members knowledgeable in Mimamsa please recommend:

a\) a good overview of the subject

b\) works they found illuminating

  

2\. Is/was there anyone like Cardona in Mimamsa? I mean a prominent scholar who also compiled bibliographies.

3\. It might be that Mimamsa was sidelined in academia - could somebody please confirm or refute this - and if the matter is more nuanced, please outline the situation.

  

I should also add that maybe some of this will become clearer once I get hold of and read Prof Aklujkar's paper called Unity of the Mimamsas, but I'm grateful for your replies and pointers at all times.

  

Thank you,

Irene
