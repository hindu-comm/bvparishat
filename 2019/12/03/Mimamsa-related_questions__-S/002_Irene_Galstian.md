Thank you for these valuable suggestions. I think in many ways we are looking for similar things, and I meant to make contact with you earlier.

  

Looking at the catalogue (<http://www.sanskrit.nic.in/publications.php>), I do see a mini-handbook of about 100 pages by Dr Kishore Nath Jha, published in 2013, in Hindi (it's the 1st item on p.20 of the catalogue - that's p.22 of the PDF). Is this the work we're searching for?

  

You also mentioned DVDs by Prof. V. N. Jha. Could you please tell more?

  

Thank you,

Irene
