Dear Dr Munsi,

  

I've tried to locate the books in the list you've kindly compiled, and for the most part things went well.

There's just one question. Dr. Pashupatinath Sastri's book was published in (at least) 2 editions: 1923 and 1980. The 2nd edition, to which I have access as a physical book, seems to be about 2/3 of the 1st, and the [archive.org](http://archive.org) scan of the 1st edition is blurry in a number of places. In terms of content, which edition should I aim to get?

  

Best wishes,

Irene
