Mr. Goswami, Mm. Dr. Mani Dravid Sastri's elucidation is just mentioned as a vivrti on the title page. As Sastriji himself says in the Sanskrit introduction, he did not write it, but only gave a running verbal explanation while teaching the Sastradipika that was tape-recorded. Later, Dr. Sharda Narayanan transcribed the audio recordings and put them into the form of a book.  

  

Dr. Galstian, I only have the [archive.org](http://archive.org) scan of Pashupatinath Sastri's book. True, the scan is very blurry at many places.

  

Yours sincerely,  

Sudipta Munsi
