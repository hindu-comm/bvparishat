Just happened to read Prof. Harold Schiffman‚Äôs paper ‚ÄúThe Tamil Liquids, Revisited‚Äù.

  
I think he is spot on that modern spoken Tamil has lost the distinction between ‡Æ∞ (the ‚Äúsoft‚Äù r) and ‡Æ± (the ‚Äúhard‚Äù r) as also between‡Æ≤ (alveolar l) and ‡Æ≥ (retroflex l); and that‡Æ¥ (zha) has merged with ‡Æ≥ (retroflex l). To me, it appears that most native speakers of Tamil get the correct pronunciation of‡Æ≥ only when they try to pronounces‡Æ¥. üôÇ At other times they have a tough time distinguishing‡Æ≤ and ‡Æ≥.
Similarly, the distinction between dental ‡Æ® (n) and alveolar ‡Æ© (·πâ) has practically disappeared. ‡Æ®‡Ææ‡Æ©‡Øç (naa·πâ, I) is pronounced as ‡Æ©‡Ææ‡Æ©‡Øç (·πâaa·πâ), the tandoori bread that we eat in Indian restaurants.  The distinction between retroflex ‡Æ£ and alveolar ‡Æ© has also blurred to the extent they have to call the former 3-chuzhi (curl) na and the latter 2-chuzhi (curl) na. 

  
When I was young, I used to wonder about these peculiarities of native Tamil pronunciation because even a Malayali child pronounces all these sounds quite distinctly and effortlessly. But now I know better. It is the nature of languages - a sound that is quite easy for speakers of one language can be an insurmountable phonetic mountain for speakers of another language.

  
I think that in native Tamil pronunciation,‡Æ≥ moved towards‡Æ≤ and both are now pronounced somewhat like the English "dark" l in names like Jill or Neil.  
  

In Malayalam, the letter‡¥¥ (‡Æ¥) is pronounced very similar to American English 'r'. When my friend Kory pronounces his first name, I hear it almost like‡¥ï‡µã‡¥¥‡¥ø (‡Æï‡Øã‡Æ¥‡Æø, kozhi) meaning hen or cock. And this is the standard literary pronunciation of‡Æ¥ in Tamil too although if the Tamil speaker is not careful, he or she will slip into‡Æ≥.

  
I think in ancient times,‡Æ©‡Øç‡Æ± was pronounced as·πâ·∏è (alveolar ‚Äòn‚Äô + alveolar ‚Äòd‚Äô) and not as ·πâ·∏è·πü as in modern literary Tamil.  I think·πü is closely related to the alveolar ·πØ and ·∏è. In Malayalam, vaya·πü≈≠ is stomach, but to say "in the stomach" we say "vaya·πØ·πØil" with the geminate alveolar·πØ. In writing, the geminate·πØ is represented by a geminate·πü.

  
I wonder at what point of time did Tamil lose all these distinctions that are still strongly maintained in Malayalam. Perhaps in the days of Tolkappiyar, even a child could effortlessly pronounce all these.
Somewhere in the flow of time these distinctions got lost, so much so that even a native Tamil holding a post graduate degree in his/her mother tongue has to spend a lot of effort to pronounce these correctly (and still might not succeed). At what point of time were correct pronunciations lost? Say, during the Pallava times, would a Tamil child have been able to pronounce these sounds correctly?
