There are multiple factors at play here. There are large numbers of Telugu speakers in influential cities like Madras-Chennai who cannot get the zha. It is popular and was even in my days among young people and TV anchors to pretend that they can’t pronounce correctly. Ra and ra, na and n_a are different cases. Retroflex na and dental na are correctly pronounced by most Tamils. So are retroflex La and dental la. After all paLLi and palli cannot be the same.
