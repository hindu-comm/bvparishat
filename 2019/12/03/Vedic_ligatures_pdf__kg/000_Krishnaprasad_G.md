Dear all

 I am looking for different Vedic ligatures used earlier in the printed books, so that I can check the fonts for errors. Any pointers will be highly appreciated.  

I have Madhyandina samhita book sent by Sri Madhav Deshpande Ji, and Sama veda book where I can refer the different ligatures for my fonts. How ever I am not able to find Atharva Veda book with Satwalekar edition.  

  

PS here is small comparison with Bold Nirnaysagar fonts and Normal weight. and some Vedic accents.
