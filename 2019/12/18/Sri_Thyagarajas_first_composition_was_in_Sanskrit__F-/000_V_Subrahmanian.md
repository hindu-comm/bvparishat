There is a legend that Sri Thyagaraja's first composition, at the very young age of 13, was a song on Sri Rama in Sanskrit.

  

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyagaraja>  

//He also showed a flair for composing music and, in his teens, composed his first song, "Namo Namo Raaghavaaya", in the Desika Todi[ragam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ragam "Ragam")and inscribed it on the walls of the house.//

  

This song is in Sanskrit.

There are other Sanskrit compositions too of this Saint. There is a discussion in a group on this:
