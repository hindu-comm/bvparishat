Namaste,

  

I had a question about the famous mantra

सर्वे भवन्तु सुखिनः , सर्वे सन्तु निरामयाः \|

सर्वे भद्राणि पश्यन्तु, मा कश्चिद्दुखभागभवेत् \|\|

  

In 3 pAdas, loT lakAra is used, bhavantu, santu, pashyantu.

Then why suddenly vidhi in the 4th as bhavet ?

  

I understand that a given lakAra covers multiple options, like loT has permission, invitation, request, etc but is there any difference in the meaning of the bhavantu and bhavet ? These are usually translated as 'may all ....', may all be happy, may all be healthy, may all see good, may no one have share of ill fortune.

  

But, are all four just 'may', as a wish, a universal betterment wish or desire?

Or is there any other possible shade of meaning?

  

loT is also used for anurodha.

Is it possible that the bhavantu etc are all request/anurodha - please be happy, healthy and see good?

  

  

Thanks,
