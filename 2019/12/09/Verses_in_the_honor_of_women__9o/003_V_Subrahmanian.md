Here is a name of Lalita Parameshwari in the Lalita Sahasra Naama:
<https://maiism.blogspot.com/2014/11/names-709-to-725.html?m=1>

  

 सुवासिन्यर्चनप्रीता- ललिता सहस्रनाम स्तोत्र,

  

//The third name state that Mother is pleased with the worship of Her by Suvaasinis, worship being nothing else but the fulfilment of the condition of their being Suvaasinis. Mother is most pleased with those female devotees that give maximum happiness to others as daughter, wife or mother or the family woman,neighbour, hostess, kind mistress to servants, patroness,donors, etc.

*WOMAN HAS THE INHERENT QUALITY OF BRINGING HAPPINESS. Mother ismost pleased with them THAT BY THEIR VERY PRESENCE, and sweet speech make allmiseriesforgotten, and with them that spread the fragrance of their silentservice and self-sacrifice.*  
  

In routine religion, Suvaasini means a married woman whose husband is alive and Suvaasinyarchanpritaaa means " Shethatis pleased by the worship offered by women with their husband alive. " In Mother's Ideal, however, religiosity has no existence without righteousness and therefore I prefer the above interpretation. There is nothing like meritoriousness or meritlessness in only fact of being married or unmarried, being with or without a husband or in the condition of the husband being alive or dead.//

  

Another way of looking at the name is: The Mother is pleased when Suvaasini-s are honored by people in all walks of life.
