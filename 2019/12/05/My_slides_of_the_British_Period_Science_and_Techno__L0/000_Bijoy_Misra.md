Friends,

  

We do our India seminar by segmenting our findings in six tracks:

Geography and People, Art ad Culture, Language and Literature,

Philosophy and Religion, Economy and Politics, Science and Technology.

The last seminar on Nov 30 was for the period 1800-1947AD labelled

as the British Period. Each presentation was 25 minutes. I am sharing

my slides. All will be posted at <https://www.indiadiscoverycenter.org>

The video of the day would also be posted. Besides the presentations,  

we had three guest lectures - an eye witness account of August 14, 1947

midnight meeting in Delhi, the account of a celebrated neuroscientist who  

trekked from Larkana, Sind to Mumbai at partition at seven years of age  

and a Pakistani scholar to present a Pakistan point of view. A full report  

would be available in two weeks.

  

Please feel free to comment on the slides. There is a lot more than the words.

The period study was hard. That India scholarship could rekindle after the  

organized efforts of annihilation is a testament to some people whose remnants

possibly exist in this group.  They managed to organize new funding and support  

through non-government channels. I offer these slides with deep personal feelings.  

I will write more on the story in the coming months.

  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
