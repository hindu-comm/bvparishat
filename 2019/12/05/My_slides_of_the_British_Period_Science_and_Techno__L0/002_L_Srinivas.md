Looks wonderful, Dr Misra.

  

I would include in the list of mathematicians, Ramchandra (1821-1880) of Delhi. He was the author of a*Treatise on Problems of Maxima and Minima.*Ramchandra (रामचन्दर) was more or less self educated although he did enrol in an English government school for a few years. His capabilities were recognized by none other than Augustus De Morgan himself. De Morgan was at that time professor of mathematics at the University College, London. De Morgan himself was born in Madurai (TN) a fact not very well known in India.

  

Ramchandra taught at Delhi College (now called Zakir Husain College) and also at the Thomason College (later known successively as Roorkee Engg College, Univ of Roorkee, and now IIT Roorkee) . He made available many contemporary English texts on algebra, trigonometry and geometry in Urdu translation and used them in class.

  

Hope this helps,
