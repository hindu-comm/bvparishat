Thank you.

  

We have uploaded one more conversation with Sri K.S. Varadacharya.

-   Brahman as Material Cause: Philosophical background, problems,
    solutions:<https://youtu.be/PQTxSnNR-2o>

-   Playlist:<https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLog-e7pBcwclpA3CkX_r1BIWPtcKJVys0> -   Subscribe:<https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRNIOCn5GI-RsJ15pgL2NOA?sub_confirmation=1>

This conversation discusses the core philosophical problem in Brahman's material causality: how can something unconscious and imperfect (the material universe) substantially originate from something that is conscious and perfect, i.e., Brahman? External creation is rejected, because Brahman then must depend on this externality (matter). And no one posits creation ex nihilo. But Brahman is independent. How to resolve the riddle?
