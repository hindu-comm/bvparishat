There are 40 Central Universities under the purview of the Ministry of Human Resource Development, created under the Act of Parliament. Out of them 16 new Central Universities have been established w.e.f 15.1.2009 in hitherto uncovered States (except Goa), by an ordinance promulgated by the president of India. The ordinance has since been replaced by an Act of parliament, namely, Central Universities Act, 2009 which has been assented to by the president of India on 20th March, 2009. While 38 of these are ***getting maintenance and development grants by the Central Government through the UGC***, IGNOU, New Delhi is funded directly by the Ministry of HRD.
