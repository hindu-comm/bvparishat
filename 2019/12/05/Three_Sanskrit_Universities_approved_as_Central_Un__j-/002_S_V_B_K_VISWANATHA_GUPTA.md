Respected sir,

  

It is really one among great universities. It is "deserved" to get a Central University status. It has tremendous manuscripts collection. but its not accessible to many scholars.

  

"NAMAMI" (National Mission for Manuscripts) must take it as initiative and make the great resource accessible "at-least for Indian scholars". Then every scholar realize the value of the university. Once the value known by everyone, then obviously everybody recommends to the MHRD to recognize as Central University.

  

We also need to thankful "whole heatedly" to the people who were behind the screen and kept great efforts make these universities as Central Universities.  

  

With best regards

Dr. S V B K V GUPTA
