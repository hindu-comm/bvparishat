Welcome, Srinivas-ji.As you may havenoticed, my (Dec 4, '19) post was a specific response to some statements of Dr. Brereton.

  

With regard to this portion of your ask—"what this means archaeologically"—I cannot think of a more substantive response than sharing[this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZvKpjjTpgg&t=7s)video (of a presentation[on Aug 2nd 2019](https://twitter.com/meghkalyansun1/status/1157163439086718977?s=20)from the conference*Sarasvati - A paradigm shift in Indology (*University of Delhi, Aug 2-3 2019)) in which 'Dr. Sanjay Manjul presents his recent findings unearthed during excavations at Sanauli, Baghpat, including possibly the largest necropolis of the chalcolithic period and a highly sophisticated material culture.' \[Portions within ' ' from the description of video in Youtube\].

  

Best,

Megh

  

PS: While a qualified archaeologist (and hence not a layman) is explaining it, a layman (that is, me) could grasp most of it.
