This is very interesting. Thanks very much for sharing.

  

A curiosity question: what relation do the Sinauli finds have with the so called Sintashta chariot burials from the Chelyabinsk province in Russia? The Sintashta chariot burials have been dated by the archaeologist to 15th to 17th century BC by archaeological methods and to 18th to 20th century BC by radio carbon dating. It seems then the antiquity of these two widely separated sites works out to be roughly the same, per carbon dating methods. The Sintashta archaeologist V F Gening too has made use of Vedic textual material to interpret the finds in the site. The gap in space between Chelyabinsk and Baghpat need hardly be stressed.  

  

Is it possible for you to give a layman's summary of what this means archaeologically, without getting into what language the authors of these two cultures may have spoken.

  

Thanks,
