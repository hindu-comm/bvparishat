\> It looks like there is no specific mythological story behind it.  
  

Yes, it seems so. By the way, no comment in Siegfried Goldschmidt's  
edition (Strassburg, London 1880) and in his German translation (1883)  
of the Setubandhu.  

  
  
\> Incidentally, do you have a soft copy of Prof.Handiqui's book?  
  

I have looked it up in my own hard copy, but now I see that Handiqui's  
excellent book can also be downloaded from [archive.org](http://archive.org):

Best regards,
