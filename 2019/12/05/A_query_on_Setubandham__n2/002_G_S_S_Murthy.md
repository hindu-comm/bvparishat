Many thanks, Dr.Steiner. It is said that there is Naagaloka as part of the netherworlds. Perhaps the poet means that. It looks like there is no specific mythological story behind it.

Incidentally, do you have a soft copy of Prof.Handiqui's book? I would like to have a look at it.

Thanks and regards,

Murthy
