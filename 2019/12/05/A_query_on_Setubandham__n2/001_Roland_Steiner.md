Dear Mr Murthy,  
  
K. K. Handiqui adds the following note to his translation of the  
stanza ("\[...\]; even as the earth, heavy-laden with the riches of the  
universe, rests on the serpents, when it is shifted from the hood of  
Ananta"):  
  
"The great serpent that sustains the weight of the earth. Here, it is  
fancied as sharing the burden with other serpents."  
  
(Pravarasena's Setubandha. Translated into English with extracts from  
unpublished commentaries, critical notes and an Introduction by  
Krishna Kanta Handiqui. (Prakrit Text Series. 20). Ahmedabad,  
Varanasi: Prakrit text Society 1976, p. 50, n. 18.)  
  
With kind regards,  
Roland Steiner
