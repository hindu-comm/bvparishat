Respected scholars,

This is Chaayaa of a verse in Pravarasena’s “Setubandham”

प्लवगाधिपतिवितीर्णा रामाज्ञप्तिः प्लवंगमेषु विलग्ना ।

 शेषफणाविक्षिप्ता त्रिभुवनसारगुर्वी महीव भुजङ्गेषु ॥ ६-१९॥

“The command of Rāma conveyed through Sugrīva fell on the monkeys (for implementation) in the manner the weight of the whole Earth falls on snakes when Ādiśeṣa off loads his burden.”

Is there a puranic story behind the seeming allusion, “the weight of the whole Earth falls on snakes when Ādiśeṣa off loads his burden.”?

I shall be obliged to be enlightened.

Thanks and regards,

Murthy
