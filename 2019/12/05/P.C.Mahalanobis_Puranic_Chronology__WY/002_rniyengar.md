Dr.Mishra,

Nice to know you liked the paper. That is the approach -analytical based on empirical evidences- is what you are promoting in your posts. Questioning past assumptions, inquisitiveness and comparative analysis are the fundamental research methods in any field including indology. I have not come across any other paper by Mahalanobis on the topic.

regards
