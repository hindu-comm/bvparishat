The post of Bijoy Mishra mentions PCMahalanobis. PCM was an extraordinary person interested in introducing analytical approaches in the study of Indian history aka Indology. His paper on the Puranas, which is actually a review of a Bengali book by G. Bose is striking in its novel arguments. At present no Sanskrit University or Department in India appears to be carrying out research into ancient texts along objective quantitative methods. Still I hope the attached paper by Mahalanobis may be of interest to some scholars here.

Thanks

PS: Is the Bengali *Puraanapravesha* of G.Bose (1934-35) available in translation?
