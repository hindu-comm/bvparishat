thanks to Sudarshan who pointed out this piece, I could read it by this scholar. still not sure about about the 1400 BC age of

Krishna/ mahabharata war considering the fact of geneologies described in Bhagavata etc. which extends to nearly three thousand+ or - years.

but the krta treta dvapara calculation may be correct because it matches with years of geneologies.

But I did not find the corelations व्याप्ति discussion relevant here.

अथ चेत्त्वमिमं धर्म्यं संग्रामं न करिष्यसि। ततः स्वधर्मं कीर्तिं च हित्वा पापमवाप्स्यसि।।  
तस्मादुत्तिष्ठ कौन्तेय युद्धाय कृतनिश्चयः। निराशीर्निर्ममो भूत्वा युध्यस्व विगतज्वरः।। (भ.गी.)
