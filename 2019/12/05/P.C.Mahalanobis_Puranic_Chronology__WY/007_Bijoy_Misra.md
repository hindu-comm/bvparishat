"universe" was replaced by "university" Sorry. Corrected below. We have an MIT conf on Jaina

universes in May.  

  

Dr Iyengar,  

Correlation is conjectural. It is to create association by grossly connecting colors and features.

It is mostly forcing a conclusion from limited data and then have new data fit into the assumptions.

Correlation in science in old. Sky is spherical or snake is evil are among such assumptions.

Race and assumption of superiority come with such gross assumptions. To me it is an immediate

abuse of own thinking capacity to create statements that might stick.
Aristotle had some form of it,  

Varahamihira though a master he was would veer into associations. Some of these associations  

continue to be in practice today. One of the associations in India is to connect physical handicap  

of a baby to some assumed activity in the past life (lives). In the Indian system of nyaya, we do  

have some analysis of this trait. 

Mostly the technique works with someone convincing others about his/her theory and before

proof is found others "build" on the theory. Jaina theory of the shape of the universe based on

"karma" is one such foundation. Elegant mathematical techniques have developed because of it,  

but it has a questionable basis. Associating human organs to aptitude is another such social  

assumption. I have not studied the neurology of the effect. Normally one should feel unsettled  

when the theory is not self-convincing. The correlation-scientists become fully comfortable in  

their theory as I observe.  

Data did not exist in the older time, like monsoons were not known, so a correlation had to be

created. India's long term weather forecasting used a a model developed in 1875 by creating  

weights on arbitrary parameters. Studying literacy through reading skills is another foundational

error. All associations appear to be forced on people to create hierarchy and self-gain. The

self-made phrases like "the chosen one", "divine selection" are created to rule others.

  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
