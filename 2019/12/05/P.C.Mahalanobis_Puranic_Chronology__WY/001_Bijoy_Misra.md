Dr. Iyengar,

I loved it. Hope all will read. Please look for follow up articles if any. He says he "would take up further research."  

Occasionally students here request for research topics. There is no better contribution than the reconstruction of  

India's history using literature evidence. Our Bengali friends here may help with the book if possible. I can read Bengali.

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
