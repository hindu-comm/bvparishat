The British tried to remove the analytic work from India. Rote reading had already come in through Quranic

injunction (follow the book!). Memorizing and reproducing verbatim in place of questioning and analyzing

became the custom. The testing was done through the ability of reproducing and not problem solving.

Fear of survival reigned the land. The fear complex is still there as I notice in many of the postings.  

Fearlessness of Gita is lost.

Correlation as a shallow bureaucratic technique was the colonial method. Must of the western literature ion

India goes with such broad stroke profiling. Indian scholars need to rise up and restore the old Indian analytic  

scholarship. India discovered numbers and counting. India is the home of number theory and analytic algebra.

Panini and Bhatrhari are more mathematicians than scholars of literature. Time has come to create  

philosophy and analysis using mathematical logic and skills.

Mahalanobis did get back to numbers just in one generation but the interdisciplinary work is lacking

because of lack of training in the scholars. Amassing massive material and classifying them into logical

orthogonal bins is India's contribution to the world! This is the modern information theory. Let all try to  

revive the tradition.. Let us throw away the scare what will happen tomorrow. Let us try to live totally  

in the present moment with confidence in our abilities!. Truth will triumph!

Bijoy Misra

  

PS. Apparently our Bengali friends did not get a copy of Puranapravesha..Please look.
