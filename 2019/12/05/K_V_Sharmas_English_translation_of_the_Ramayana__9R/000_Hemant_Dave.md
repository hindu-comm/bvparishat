Namaskar!

Professor K V Sharma translated the entire Ramayana into English with a group of scholars. In the MLBD Newsletter it shows/ed as "forthcoming publication" for the past several years. Dr. Mamta Dahs-Mishra wrote to me in a personal mail that before Prof. Sharma passed away in 2005, he had completed the translation of the Ramayana and the manuscript was submitted to MLBD.

Is there any way to get this translation published?

Best,

Hemant
