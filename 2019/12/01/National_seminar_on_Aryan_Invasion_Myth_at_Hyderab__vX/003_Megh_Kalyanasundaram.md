This is so good to see Srinivas! Congratulations to all involved in making this seminar happen and best wishes for its success.

  

I am particularly delighted to see pioneers such Dr. Bhagwan Singh (see [here](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/bvparishat/kKxASUdOir4/BxFd0dJWBAAJ) ,[here](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/bvparishat/kKxASUdOir4/YuVeGGS0FAAJ)and [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/bvparishat/n8VWeRRGeWU/AU9zXomYEQAJ) for related posts in BVP and [this](https://twitter.com/meghkalyansun1/status/1157194578660745216?s=20)tweet) being invited to present his research in this regard. It is (also personally) heartening to see the venue of the seminar:ISB!

  

Coming together of many star contributors (some with scholarship specific to the Aryan issue that has spanned decades) at an[iconic campus](https://www.isb.edu/about-isb/campuses/hyderabad)!

  

Best,

Megh

  

Notes:

  

1\. Since T.R.S Prasanna is missing in this line-up, I include here his latest (2018 May) paper on the Aryan topic[*Assessing scientific evidences in the Aryan debate*](https://www.currentscience.ac.in/Volumes/114/09/1978.pdf), which Manogna and I had highlighted in slide 44 (see below) of our 2019 Aug presentation *[Aryan problem from the perspective of Textual Evidence and Linguistics (Aug 02, 2019)](https://www.academia.edu/40037600/Aryan_problem_from_the_perspective_of_Textual_Evidence_and_Linguistics_Aug_02_2019_),*along with Michel Danino's 2018 March paper*[Fabricating Evidence in Support of the Aryan Invasion / Migration Theory](https://www.academia.edu/39599444/Fabricating_Evidence_in_Support_of_the_Aryan_Invasion_Migration_Theory).*
