Thanks for this announcement. Are there any abstracts or summaries from the 'Genetic Evidence' section of this seminar that you can post? It would be very useful.  

  

Of late, there's been quite a bit of discussion on the Net on related matters. I am refering to the so called 'Yamnaya' migrations. In particular, to the recent book by David Reich which seems to have got great reviews from many erstwhile Indo European scholars. Surprisingly, the book's got good reviews from Indians too incl a cautious one from the Nobel laureate, Venki Ramakrishnan.  

  

There's also this article/monograph by Vagheesh Narasimhan in which Reich appears as a co-author. Here's the link:

Being a technical subject, it will be good if someone can translate for the layman the methodology used by these genetics scholars and critically review it. It will be useful also to know what these bio anthropological theories mean for the discredited Colonial era Aryan invasion thesis.  

  

Reich's book and reviews thereof maybe found here:

Thanks again and Warm Regards,
