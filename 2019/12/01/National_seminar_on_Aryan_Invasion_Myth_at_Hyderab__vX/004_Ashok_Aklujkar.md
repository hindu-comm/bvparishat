Dear Shri Srinvas,

  

Thanks for the update received today.

  

Is there anyone else of the speakers/participants who is coming from Pune on the same flight as I (9pm flight)?

  

Will I get the specifics of my accommodation in Hyderabad in the next 2-3 days?

  

Has Prof. Paturi been in touch with you regarding the date of my return to Pune? I will contact him by tomorrow to inquire. If possible, I would like to be in Pune by the night of the 8th, so that I do not have to change a 7am appointment on 09 Dec, but the work I have envisaged for Hyderabad is more important, since I may not get another chance to be in Hyderabad in the near future.

  

Best wishes.

  

a.a.
