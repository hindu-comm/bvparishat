नमांसि,

  

परिमाणवाचकः = एकार्थवाचकः । An entity whose multiple copies are treated identical. For example, 2 coins, even when they differ slightly in texture / size etc, are considered equivalent. This is called एकार्थ.

So we can have शस् attached to भाग - (Multiple parts being treated identical, allowing us to attach शस्) - "भागशः"Same for पाद - Foot being treated as a परिमाण (एकार्थवाचक).

  

Also, "एतच्च सर्वं जयादित्यमतानुसारेणोक्तम् । वामनमते जातिशब्देभ्योऽपि भवत्येव" - तत्त्वबोधिनी. So even words like कुण्डशः, वनशः are acceptable according on one set of scholars.
