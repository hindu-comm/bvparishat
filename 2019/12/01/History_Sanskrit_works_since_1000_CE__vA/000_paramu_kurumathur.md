Dear friends,

  

Am looking for a list/history of works (something like Macdonnell's book) in the Sanskrit language after 1000 CE I think Macdonnell covers only to around 800/900/1000 CE. For example, he does not mention Shankara. Also, he does not talk of the enormous amount of works that came from Maharashtra, for example. Or from South India. What I am looking for should include modern literature also. (Am sure many members of this forum have composed good Sanskrit works)

  

Any advice?

  

Regards
