Long time back when DLI was still active and responsive, i downloaded a Hindi translation of Acarya Rudrata's Kavyalankara with a Hindi Translation by Dr. Satyadev Chaudhari.

  

Tried to find this edition on Archive.org but could not find it easily, so i've uploaded it to the following location :<https://gofile.io/?c=uZyiC0>

  

Shankara ji, in case this edition is not present on [archive.org](http://archive.org), can you please upload it?

  

sādhu-caraṇa-rajo'bhilāṣī,

  

hari parshad das.
