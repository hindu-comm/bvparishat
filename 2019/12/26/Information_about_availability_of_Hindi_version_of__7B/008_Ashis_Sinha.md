To.

Shankaraji.

Respected Sir,

 I am much ashamed to encroach upon your valuable time repeatedly. I have read your previous response in this regard. Now I beg your pardon to request you to be kind enough to tell me whether THE ORIGINAL BOOK OF Kavyanusasana of Bagbhat II containing SANSKRIT PORTION ONLY is available. That will also serve my purpose. I am extremely in need of that book. I have already been favoured by you several times earlier in this regard. I am hopeful that this time also I will receive your generous help if it is possible.

             With deep regards,

                                   
                             Yours sincerely,

                                   
                               Ms. S. Sinha
