Respected Shankaraji,

  I am MIss. S. Sinha. Yesterday i.e.on 28.12.19 I placed a request in the Group for helping me by giving me an informationregarding availability of Kāvyānuśāsana of Bāgbhat II with Hindi commentary/translation. But I forgot my mention my name. I will be grateful if you kindly provide me the link as before.

                                   
                                   
With regards,

                                   
                                   
Yours sincerely,

                                   
                                   
  Ms. S. Sinha.
