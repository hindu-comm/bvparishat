Respected Shankarji,  

With reference to above I am to inform you that I have found out from my previous collection one copy of Rudrata's Kavyalamkara withHindi translation edited by Shri Ramdeva Shukla published by Chowkhamba Vidyabhavan. That will serve my purpose.

            With thanks and respect for you Sir,

                                   
            Yours sincerely,

                                   
           Ms. Sebanti Sinha.
