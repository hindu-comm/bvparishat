Namaskaaram Mr. Subrahmanian,

  

Thank you for sharing reportage<https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/earliest-epigraphic-proof-for-saptamatrikas-found/article30399629.ece>of this significant new find.

  

When I accessed the above link earlier today, I was unable to read the entire article without a subscription.

  

Reportage of this find seems far lesser than the attention it (in my view) deserves and for those who might be interested, here is another [source](https://www.ibtimes.sg/archaeologists-unearth-earliest-sanskrit-inscription-found-southern-india-36596?utm_campaign=/archaeologists-unearth-earliest-sanskrit-inscription-found-southern-india-36596) that provides atleast some information without requiring subscription.

  

Best,

Megh

  

PS: There is more than one word/usage in[this](https://www.ibtimes.sg/archaeologists-unearth-earliest-sanskrit-inscription-found-southern-india-36596?utm_campaign=/archaeologists-unearth-earliest-sanskrit-inscription-found-southern-india-36596)that might seem problematic to some but sharing it is not an endorsement of everything in it.
