Hare Krishna.  
  
This is from Srimad Bhagavatam 11.17.10,  
  
ādau kṛta-yuge varṇo nṛṇāṁ haṁsa iti smṛtaḥ  
kṛta-kṛtyāḥ prajā jātyā tasmāt kṛta-yugaṁ viduḥ  
  
This shows a reason for why there were no kings and why the yuga was  
known as krta-yuga.  
  
I have curiosity for many year to know that if there were no kings in  
Krta-yuga then who was Hiranyakasipu, Prahlada, Dhruva, his father,  
Priyavrata, etc.? Were they not kings?  
  
One answer I could get from the commentaries of Srimad Bhagavatam,  
11.17.10, that this is spoken about the first krta-yuga only and not  
the subsequent ones. See attached file.  
  
I would like to know if revered scholars have something more to reflect upon it.  
  
Thankyou,  
Hari Guru Vaisnava Das,  
damodara das
