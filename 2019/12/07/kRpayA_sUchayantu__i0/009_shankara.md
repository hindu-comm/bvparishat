Irene ji,

  

Regarding DLI scans of Sahridaya not appearing in [archive.org](http://archive.org) search, it is better to search using Google. Giving below search string using Google. Google search yields results even if the spelling doesn't match exactly, so we need not bother about Sahrdaya, Sahridaya or Sahrudaya.  

  

sahridaya site:[archive.org](http://archive.org)  

  

regards  
shankara
