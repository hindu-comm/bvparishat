I have scanned and uploaded these volumes of Sahrudaya . All the volumes are not there. The magazine never had first or second series. The old Numbering for issues is given along with new numbering system they use. Here is the link. Please try to upload missing issues as and when you get a chance to scan them

No issues uploaded has been removed. The search is not temperamental. One has to search archives if needs to use [archive.org](http://archive.org) Different up-loaders use different spellings There can be no one correct way of assigning English spellings to Sanskrit or Indian Languages unless one uses diacritics. Search function doesn't work well with diacritics.
