Ajit ji,

  

Thank you for the link to your collection.

Re series, I can only go by what is printed on the covers: if it says 'New Series' and 'Old Series', then the publication must have had it. What I referred to as 1st and 2nd series are the Old and New series, respectively.

As for the search function on archive, I can only state my own experiences, which, considering Shankara ji's advice, aren't particularly unusual.

Will try to scan what the BL will allow and go from there.

  

Best wishes,

Irene
