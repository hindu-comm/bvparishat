In the soft copy that was uploaded in the [academia.org](http://academia.org), I have provided the hyperlinks to the recorded videos (of those sessions for which videos were uploaded on youTube). I used those videos to document many of the sessions I could not attend. I could not report out individual presentations, as they should be published as individual papers.

  

This book is a tribute to BVP as a whole. I never imagined, documenting the proceedings will become a book in reality. To be frank, it took 4 months for me to prepare the report (from January 2019 till April 2019), as each lecture was so full of information, that I did not want to miss the salient points. I thank all the members, organizing committee and especially Dr V. Pandurangi for allowing me to report out the proceeding.

The link may not be right now valid. During proof-reading, I found I had made quite a few grammatical errors, as I was switching between Sanskrit and English, and I was trying to capture the intent of the speaker. I am sure, there still will be such errors. But I believe, the content is more important, and the readers will forgive me for such oversights.

  

Namaste,

Warija Adiga
