Namaste,

Thank you for the interest on the book. The publisher has indicated that it will take a week or 2 for the book to be available online..

Regarding the question if all the papers presented are a partof the book, sorry, they are not there. It is a summary of events and it was virtually impossible for me to access each paper and write about it.

I assume, the papers will be published by the organizingcommittee.

Respectfully yours,

Warija
