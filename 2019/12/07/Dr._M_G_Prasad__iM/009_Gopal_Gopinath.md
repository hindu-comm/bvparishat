Namaste

  

I was fortunate to had opportunities to work with him while editing souvenirs for a temple near Washington DC. We had hosted him for various events as distinguished speaker. He had readily shared with me some small volumes by his Guru which were then out of print upon request. Please find in the page linked below a collection of articles he had authored for various souvenir volumes between 2012- August 2019. Surely his passing away is a loss to groups of students of Hindu Dharma in different classes he had been leading.
