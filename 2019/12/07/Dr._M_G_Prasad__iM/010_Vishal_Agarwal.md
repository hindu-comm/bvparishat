My own personal interaction with Dr Prasad was in June 2016 when I co-taught a day long class with him at a Swaminarayan Mandir at Monmouth Junction, NJ. He was an exceptionally lucid teacher. The following day, a Sunday, he invited me over for lunch at his home and I fondly remember his and his wife's hospitality. He showed me his beautiful collection of bells and dongs (given his Accoustics background) from many different countries, and I had the darshana of his Shalagramas (including the Agnigarbha variety) and also saw his fabulous collection of books. He gifted me a few of his books (now my prized possessions) and also a book on festivals by his Guru, plus a movie CD produced by one of his sons. Thereafter, he kept in touch via texts and emails. When I learned of his departure on 11/25, all these memories came back to my mind.

  

May Paramatma give him refuge in Vaikuntha. Om Shanti!
