Friends,

I just heard that Prof. M G Prasad, a contributor to the discussion here

passed away Nov 25 last month in his home in New Jersey. An expert  

in acoustics, he was a devout scholar of the scriptures and a disciplined

man of religious rituals. Here is the public obituary.

He was young, active and energetic. He would be deeply missed.
