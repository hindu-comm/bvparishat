Very sad. I knew Prasad from some of his papers on Vibration and acoustics. A few years back I attended his talk on Bells, Gongs, & Conch, at KSU Bangalore. He had an inquisitive analytical approach to understand ancient Hindu cultural and religious practices. Combination of modern theory of vibration with Naada, Mantra,... leads to a heady mix of maths & mysticism. MGS was working in that rarified field. We miss him ....
