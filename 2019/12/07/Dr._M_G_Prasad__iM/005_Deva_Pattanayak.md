Yes, he very clearlydescribed the four stages of ahata nada as describedin the Vedas.

I hope someone should do research on it as well as the anahata nada.

I am sure he will be rememberedfor his contributions for a long time to come.

My condolences to his surviving family and my prayer for the sadgati of his atma.

Deva
