I would like to express condolences to Prof Prasad's family, friends, colleagues, and students.

Since people who dedicate their life to science live on through their works when the earthly body is no longer active, let's commemorate this researcher by compiling and posting on his memorial thread a list of his works.

Let people who see this thread leave it with the inspiration of Prof Prasad's ideas, not merely with the sadness of his passing.

  

Thank you,

Irene
