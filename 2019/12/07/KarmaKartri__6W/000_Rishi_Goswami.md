In SK, I'm currently studying Karmakartri.  
  
There, basic rules are, when Karma becomes Karta, there is no Karma, so Lakar will be in भाव or कर्ता। Lakar won't be in कर्म. (But if Kriyaphal is in Karma, like Viklitti in Odan, then Karta will have कर्मवद्भाव, means all कार्य like यक् आत्मनेपद etc will happen. Due to that, that may seem like ओदन is Karma, but no, Odan is Karta).  
  
पच्यते ओदनेन (भावे लः)। ओदनः पच्यते। (कर्तरि लः)  
  
But in द्विकर्मक Dhatus, only 1 Krma becomes the Karmakarta, so There is 1 karma left. So now Dhatu (eg, Math Duh) will become एककर्मक and not अकर्मक। So Lakara will be in कर्ता and कर्म but not भाव।  
  
Then, there is a problem.  
In Normal Kartari = क्षीरसागरं(सागरात्) सुधां मथ्नाति।  
KarmaKartari (kartari lah) = क्षीरसागरः सुधां मथ्नाति।  
Karmani Lah = (here problem)  
क्षीरसागरः सुधां मथ्यते।  
  
In this, if it was Karmavachya also, the same would be formed and Lakara would also be in Karma.गौणे कर्मणि दुह्यादौ प्रधाने नीहृकृष्वहाम्।  
Gauna karma, "Ksheerasagara" is Ukta, hence will face Prathamaa. Anukta Sudha will face Dwitiyaa.  
  
In पच्यते ओदनः, Lakar was in Karta, Odana was Karmakarta, but just Yak in Pach due to कर्मवद्भाव। In Ksheerasagara, case is different, Lakara is itself in Karma. Then what difference?  
  
  
Also, Sagara is now, Karmakarta, so technically, it isn't Karma. The Karma is Sudha, because now Math is Ekakarmaka, so there is no Gauna Karma and Pradhana Karma, the Lakara has to be in whichever Karma it gets. So, technically कर्म which is left is सुधा. If Lakara is in this karma (सुधा), then उक्तत्वात् न द्वितीया।  
The real sentence should be = क्षीरसागरः सुधा मथ्यते। But Balamanorama says सुधां मथ्यते।
