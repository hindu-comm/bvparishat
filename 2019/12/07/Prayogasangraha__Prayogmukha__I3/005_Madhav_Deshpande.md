The WorldCat says that only one or two libraries have this book, and I do not know where you can buy it. Should enquire with Motilal Banarsidass and others. Let me know if you find a copy. I looked in my personal library, and I don't have a copy of it. I must have seen only a reference to this publication while writing my article.
