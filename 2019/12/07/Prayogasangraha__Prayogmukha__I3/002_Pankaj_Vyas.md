 Thank you sir for the kind information. Actually you cited it in your research paper entitled **: Karakas: direct and indirect relationship
{We know of a number of texts bearing the title K‡rakacakra. The most  
famous among these is the K‡rakacakra of Bhav‡nanda Siddh‡ntav‡g„ ̃a.  
Other K‡rakacakra works are ascribed to Vararuci (cf.  
K‡rakacakrad„paprabh‡ by N‡r‡yaıa, Trivandrum Sanskrit Series, No. 33,  
1913), Dharmak„rti (commentary on VararuciŸs K‡rakacakra or  
Prayogamukha, ed. by M. Rangacharya, Madras, 1927), Ananta (cf. New  
Catalogous Catalogorum, I.159), R‡mataraıa ̄iromaıi, evidently published  
in 1883, have not seen personally), and Puru ̆ottamadeva (published along  
  
with his Paribh‡ ̆‡vÁtti and J§‡pakasamuccaya, in Savit‡r‡ya-SmÁti-  
Sa ̧rak ̆aıa-Grantham‡l‡, ed. by Dinesh Chandra Bhattacharya, Varendra**  
  
Research Museum, Rajshahi, Bengal, 1946).
