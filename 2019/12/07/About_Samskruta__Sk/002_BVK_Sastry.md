Namaste



On the triggered debate of \<Samskruth --(to)-- Prakruth --(to)-- Pali --(to)-- Maagadhi/ardhamagadhi --(to)-- Munda- Marathi--(to)--Odiya \>.

Specific line wise answers, before detailing are as below:



1. Was there only one mother tongue of the early human inhabitants of various regions of the land that is now called Bharat or India?

**BVK Sastry on (1) : No. The question is loaded. The expectation is illogical. A counter question can only answer this, in the nature of : Was 'Hebrew the mother tongue of every family which populated the Holy land? **

****

2. If yes, is that language Samskruta?



**BVK Sastry on (2) : Not applicable.**



3. If no, were there many languages in different regions?

**BVK Sastry on (3) : Yes. the relation of Samskruth with the languages of the 'rashtra' are documented in several grammar works. There is a need to research 'language landscape of Bharath for the period ' Buddha/ Mahaveera Back till Valmiki (before speaking of Language of Vedas)'.
The indologists and Colonial construction of Bharateeya-Bhashaa- itihasa : Indic language history and research based on this premise needs a revisit and total review. **



4. Are there written or spoken evidence of other languages before the Vedas?

**BVK Sastry on (4) : A misconception on 'Vedas' and Vedic language' as Historical, social, alien to land called 'Bharath' based on Biblical narrative of ' Languages' linked to 'Tower of Babel' drives this question. If the question is to be reworded and asked, what is the language historicity and diversity in land called Bharath, it goes back to ' earlier than Valmiki ( circa 6000 BCE or earlier) and deeper. The referential language standard was called ' Arya Bhashaa' , aka Samskrutham. this had two streams :Visioned sacred language (Chandas):Vedas and Social application of Cultured standard languages for rest of the social languages to approach and get linked. This pool of languages is called Prakruths. Apabhramsha, Mleccha, Dramidams.
Research is needed to trace the footprints of these in India and connect them to the modern Indian languages. This is 'Swa-deshi' 'Bhashaa- Vijnana - Shaastra'. The evidence is not always what one stands of the 'Samskruth term today'. Or interpreting the given vedic term using inappropriate grammar tools and conjecturing. **

**understanding Truth needs courage to invest and take exploration with associated risks. Do we have the motivated teams to dip in to their deep pockets to undertake this research, even if one wants to call it in search of ' Mount Meru / kailash' ?? - The oil and gold rush models ?? The stake is understanding the entire history of South Asia and Four World major religions, Languages of these religions. **



Now for the rest of the mail:





1. It is nice to see the discussion on ' Samskrutham: and Allied /Derived/ Influenced language family of Brahmi Origin at Bharath is slowly surfacing. Now, it seems to be the model of \< Samskruth- Prakruth- Pali \> in place of earlier models of \<Vedic - Classical> ; Brahminical and Non-Brahminical Buddhist and Jain ; Native languages of India and invaders and imported langauges to bharath.



2. Much of the ' Indology ' views on ' Indic Languages' is based on the narratives from Beyond- India Language model theories and researchers ! and these views are taken as sacrosanct to bind the
'Vedic Samskruth tradition'. The ' Panini-Patanjali-Yaska' Work centric Language narrative / Or even better \< Vashishtha -Vishwamitra - Valmiki-Vyasa> model of Language- Literature narrative, \< Rushi- Teerthankara- Buddha- Yogi> model Leaders are still a taboo in academics!



3. While on the topic of ' History- Historicity and Contemporaneous utility-status of each langauge' is important to understand, it is also important to know how the colonial scholars got access to the Brahmi Language family and learnt it; especially Samskruth; and later on each of the branch-off from ' Samskruth- Prakruti' to become ' Praakruth- Vikruti' : The model of Root to branches of the banyan tree ! Over a period of time, the mother root of banyan tress cannot be distinguished from the secondary roots. So the argument :Which one is the primary root and which is the secondary root can become an eternally irresolvable debate !



4. I point the readers to go through the link below which explains : How in 1793, William Jones learnt Sanskrit at Bengal. If one goes through the document more in detail, there is a section which explains -" Distorting a grammatical tradition: Problems with Mills's translation".



The Oldest Grammar of Hindustani -by - Tej K. Bhatia (1983)

<https://surface.syr.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1170&context=suscholar>

Syracuse Scholar (1979-1991) - Volume 4 - Issue 2 Syracuse Scholar Fall 1983 Article 10- 1983



***The paper opens with the following observation***: Just how challenging was the learning of exotic languages, let alone the writing of their grammars, some three centuries ago? To answer this question let me cite the classic case of Sir William Jones, a distinguished Orientalist and the founder of the Royal Asiatic Society of Bengal. Sir William wanted to learn the Sanskrit language when he was appointed a Supreme Court judge in Calcutta in 1793. Every attempt was made to hire a Brahman to teach him. Surprisingly, in spite of the high salary offered, no Brahman in Calcutta offered to take the job. Attempts to hire a teacher from other cities also failed. In those days, Brahmans, who held the highest rank in the elaborately structured Indian society, were primarily responsible for teaching the Sanskrit language. **Although Bengal was under British dominance, no self respecting Brahman came forward to teach the distinguished representative of the British ruling class. The reason for this was the Indian view that anyone who crossed the boundaries of the Indian Ocean was an ''untouchable.'' By this definition, Europeans were inherently ''super untouchables." Finally, however, a doctor, a non-Brahman, agreed to teach Sir William. He was in a position to defy the rules because he had no family and, being a doctor, was indispensable to society. His act of defiance in offering to teach Sir William was not without its own stipulations. Among other conditions, he required his pupil to adopt a vegetarian diet, provide special seating arrangements, observe an appropriate dress code, and hire a Hindu servant to bring the holy water of the sacred Ganges River to purify the study room**. Thus prospective language learners had to face an extreme form of linguistic chauvinism as well as a lack of bilingual language instruction and pedagogical materials. This restricted and crippling language-learning environment handicapped the earliest foreign grammarians of Hindustani for more than a century. Consequently, the learning of languages and the writing of grammars demanded not only intellectual exercise but also a keen sense of linguistic adventure on the part of foreign learners.



The point is to highlight the issue: The prevalent native view about Languages at India, historicity and value standards. and how academia and oriental scholars have ignored these warning notes of ' Language Distortion in almost every aspect : by script, by phonetic, by grammar, by term-meaning explanation, by intention, by motive......".



5. Another interesting article to read in this context is :

Vedic, Sanskrit, and Prakrit - Author(s): Walter Petersen- Source: Journal of the American Oriental Society, Vol. 32, No. 4 (Dec., 1912), pp. 414-428 -Published by: American Oriental Society - Stable URL: <https://www.jstor.org/stable/3087594>



***This paper concludes ( quoted in the post below, highlight mine) ***: It cannot be my object here to discuss anew the question as to the interpretation of the fact that Pali appears in inscriptions before Sanskrit, or what is the explanation of this "break in the continuity" of development. My only concern is to show that the results of Franke's book "Pali und Sanskrit" do not necessarily conflict with the above theory. According to op. cit. 49 the results of Franke's examination of
inscriptions show "das auch spitestens im 3. Jahrhundert v. Chr. und noch geraume Zeit danach auf der vorderindischen Halbinsel unterhalb des Himalaya und auf Ceylon als allgemeine Landessprache der arischen Bevolkerung kein irgendwie geartetes Sanskrit in irgend einer Provinz vorhanden war, sondern erst allmahlich aufgekommen ist**." The emphasis should be on the "allgemeine"; i. e. Sanskrit, as shown above, was indeed never a universal vernacular, but a caste language from the beginning, which explains the fact that the 428 Walter Petersen, Vedic, Sanskrit, and Prakrit inscriptions, which were meant to be understood by as many people as possible, were originally in Pali.** It was but natural, consequently, that the speech of the aristocracy, not understood by enough people to be used in public inscriptions, and also often not the vehicle of literary works, since they, even when they finally appeared, were written in the imported Classical Sanskrit, should have completely disappeared to our view
-from most localities. **Finally, when the renewed ascendancy of Brahmanism caused a greater number of persons to understand if not to speak the Brahman language, the Classical Sanskrit, originating in a certain locality and displacing the polite languages of other localities, made its way not only into the inscriptions of Aryavarta, but to every part of India where Brahman culture was disseminated**.



I leave it to the best of contemplations of scholars to connect these two papers and think on the following statement ( even if it means a provocative one):



 Does Bharath Study, Bharateeya Vidwat Study mean only three things:



(i) Constructing Bharat as 'land of Brahmins only ?

(ii) Deconstructing and denigrating everything connected with
Brahmincal tradition, held as sacred, cultural, historical, national inheritance with evidence going back to some five miellennia using 'academicians freedom' and ' political highhandedness' 

(iii) limiting the studies to ' Colonial lens and Biblical language model of Proto's ?



This , if it be so, would be nothing but ' hatred for a community' to advance a ' theologically driven academic perspective to promote and benefit a religion - perspective' ? I wish it would not be so.
