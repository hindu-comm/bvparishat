Dear Venkat-ji

  

As I wrote my interest is no longer in understanding how Sanskrit developed into the language that it is.

I believe the modern day Physics will benefit from the concepts in the Vedas. That can happen if a bridge can be made between the two. My effort is that of a gunduchi musa adding few grains of sand.

Best Regards

Deva

A physicist turned an engineer and now trying to be a physicist again!
