I have few questions that I amhoping you can answer for me

  

1\. Was there only one mother tongue of the early human inhabitants of various regions of the land that is now called Bharat or India?

2\. If yes, is that language Samskruta?

3\. If no, were there many languages in different regions?

4\. Are there written or spoken evidence of other languages before the Vedas?

  

Short authoritative answers with specific pramanas but not extensive, will be muchappreciated and advance thank you for your time andhelp.
