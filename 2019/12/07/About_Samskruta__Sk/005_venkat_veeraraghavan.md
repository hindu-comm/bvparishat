Dear Shri Pattanayak,

  

You say you have a thesis.

  

Have you studied the Vedas? If so which shakha?

There are too many inaccuracies in your post that make me infer that you have not.

  

So, on what basis are you making all these assertions?

Making assertions without basic knowledge of a field amounts to "unscientific process" as per my layman's grounding in the modern sciences. So, how do you reconcile your patently unscientific approach to dissecting the Veda with your own scientific background as given in your first mail in BVP (your introduction)?



It would take too long and be tedious to point out all inaccuracies, so I will just point out the obvious explicit ones:

1\. Knowledge of Veda is the shabda itself ...

2\. What do you mean by a "Vedic language" as opposed to Sanskrit?  
3. "I think what is needed is not only respect for diversity ... cast, creed or color."

4\. Having a Doctorate in a silo of the vast field of Physics does not give one the tools or the wherewithall to dissect other streams of knowledge. This is a fallacious thought process followed by many "scientists" of the western world and increasingly a fad among those of the East where in they start flaunting their own bloated opinions on subjects beyond their ken. Such scientists have merely exchanged one form of zealotry for another!

  

Point 3 pretty much amounts to virtue signalling on a rather massive scale.

BVP's post guidelines say the following:

"Polemical and pious posts are not allowed."

  

How is point 3 not polemical or pious?

  

You expect pramanas in the most direct manner from everyone else and yet sir, you show so little of your own hand.

  

This is a forum for people to gain knowledge and share.

Let us keep it that way.

Also I see that you have a habit of starting a thread and not acknowledging the people who take the time and pains to reply, thereby leaving threads hanging. Please reply and acknowledge if you have had closure.

  

There is no place here for hidden agendas.

  

Kind Regards,

  

Venkat
