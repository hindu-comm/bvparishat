All the points from Sri Deva Pattanayak-ji are layman observations about the field that already has professional answers from both from traditional and modern scholarship:

  

\> The knowledge in the Veda was written in a Vedic Language and not Sanskrit.

  

-- None from any strand of scholarship ever said or says, Veda was *written*.

  

The language of the Veda being treated as a treated as a different language than Sanskrit is one kind of 'modern' scholarship. Panini gives rules for the variation of the Vedic usage. Vaidika and laukika are treated as two different versions of the same language.

  

  

\> That Vedic Language was improved and its grammar made so difficult that only a few handful of people can understand and study.

  

--- grammars of languages are not made. They can neither be made difficult nor easy. Majority of the Indic subcontinent was speaking the language with Sanskrit as the common uniform form across the regions and Prakrits as the regional and social variations. Odia, like many north Indian languages is a descendant of one of the Prakrits.

  

Odiya-Bengali competition has nothing to do with Sanskrit.

  

\> The Bharatiya Vidvat Parishad has a responsibility to support and advance Vidya ( knowledge) and follow the moto that knowledge can be acquired by people of any society, cast, creed or color.

  

Yes. BVP already has that motto and follows it.
