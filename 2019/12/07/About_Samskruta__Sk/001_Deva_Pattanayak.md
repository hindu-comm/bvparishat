My thesis is simple. The knowledge in the Veda was written in a Vedic Language and not Sanskrit.

That Vedic Language was improved and its grammar made so difficult that only a few handful of people can understand and study.

That is the reason why the mother tongue of many in India is not Sanskrit. The number of persons speaking Odia far outweighs those speaking Sanskrit. While taking Sanskrit Class during my matriculation days I found that I can very easily transform all Odia words into Sanskrit words.

By the way, Odia is a highly phonetic language and is written as it is pronounced.

Also it is in record that some influential Bengalis proposed to replace Odia by Bengali in Schools saying that " Odia ekta swyatantra bhasha noi" ( Odia is a not a independentlanguage). It was a British Officer John Beams, a linguist disagreed and went againstthe proposal.

Now Odia is one of the five classical languages of India.

I think what is needed is not only respect for diversity but inclusion of diversity in the society, It means allowing everybody to advance society their way in their capacity. No protection for any group when it comes to exclusive right. Actually that is law in India and USA, two of the most successful democracies.

Mankind has made remarkable technical advances because of the advances in microelectronics and information technology. There is plenty for everybody and more.

The Bharatiya Vidvat Parishad has a responsibility to support and advance Vidya ( knowledge) and follow the moto that knowledge can be acquired by people of any society, cast, creed or color.

  

  

  

  

  

Here is a quote from a paper that I attach.

" The emphasis should be on the "allgemeine"; i. e. Sanskrit, as shown above, was indeed never a universal vernacular, but a caste lan- guage from the beginning, which explains the fact that the I Pali u. Skt. 88. 2 JRAS. 1904. 451 f.

It was but natural, consequently, that the speech of the aristocracy, not under- stood by enough people to be used in public inscriptions, and also often not the vehicle of literary works, since they, even when they finally appeared, were written in the imported Classical Sanskrit, should have completely disappeared to our view -from most localities. Finally, when the renewed ascendancy of Brahmanism caused a greater number of persons to under- stand if not to speak the Brahman language, the Classical Sanskrit, originating in a certain locality and displacing the polite languages of other localities, made its way not only into the inscriptions of Arydvarta, but to every part of India where Brahman culture was disseminated."
