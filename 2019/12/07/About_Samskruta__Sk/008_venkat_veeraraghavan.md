Sir,  

  

I have read what you have written.

  

I assume you are also a part of closed groups where Physics of your specialisation is discussed.

  

Kindly consider this:

Assume that you are part of a forum of scholars and students of Quantum Mechanics.

1\. How much Oxygen would you give a person who came onboard and spoke about Quantum healing and Quantum woo woo after having read Deepak Chopra?

2\. If the same person decided to criticize the "Jewish conspiracy" behind the prominence of Jewish Scientists in the field, just how seriously would you take him/.her?

3\. How long before you boot the person out?

  

There is a difference between searching and finding / fixing and searching.

The former constitutes seeking. The latter is entirely agenda driven whether unintentionally subliminal or malicious.

The former tries to hit a bulls-eye while the latter tries to draw circles around wherever one decides to shoot.

  

It is possible to make a hundred mistakes and still get a Postdoc in almost any field since everything nowadays is for sale. Even Doctorates can be given out like confetti.

In a Veda Pareeksha one mistake is all it takes to fail. And this is probably the only stream of knowledge where 100% retention and knowledge is expected unlike in other fields.

Many of the scholars in this forum have done 12 years of adhyayana ..there are even some ghanapaatis among them.

I'll let you decide for yourself where your opinions stand amidst all this learning.

  

The unkindest cut in your post that invited this riposte was your snide suggestion that the unmentioned "Evil Brahmin" purposely made grammar complicated so as to retain "control".

That statement is an insult to every scholar and student of Panini on this forum not to mention a blatant attack on all the great Acharyas who have sacrificed so much to keep this knowledge alive through holocausts and poverty.

One of our members Sri Nityanand Misra wrote a moving account of the Bhaimi Vyakhya and what sacrifices its author made to get it to print. If some one has that copy please share again.

  

Study of the Vedas does not pay. It does not feed in today's world. Still these young men do it out of a sense of duty. These men are much better men than the two of us.

I'll remind you again. You invited yourself here. Dont take a dump on your hosts which is unpardonable since apart from being classless etiquette, the Brahmins of today especially the ones who have given themselves to their calling despite lack of patronage have a strength you will never understand.

You do not get to have an opinion because you belong to this club.

You have to earn it through study and tapasya.

  

Kind Regards,

  

Venkat
