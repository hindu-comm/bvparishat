"There is no place here for hidden agendas."  

  

Dear Venkat_ji,

  

I have no hidden agenda of any kind.

  

I learned Rig Veda from the book " Ka:Stories of the Mind and Gods of India" by Roberto Calasso. The book is a translation from Italian by the same author.

We, a group of about ten persons took a year to go through the book our way taking turns.

  

This has led to my interest in the Vedas.

  

Few things new to me before I read the book:

  

Brahma means mighty.

Mind created the world.

The objective is to create the universe as it used to be after it was dissolved.

  

Assuming this to be true it means that the blueprint of the universe is non-destructible ( can be used again and again when needed) and the course of the evolution of the universe is preordained. Interestingly, Feynman, one of the most distinguished Physicist, said:

  

" We have an illusion that we can do any experiment that we want. We all, however, come from the same universe, have evolved with it . and do not have any real freedom. For we obey certain laws and have come from a certain past."

  

R. P. Feynman, Simulating Physics with Computers, Int.J.Theor. Phys. 21, 467-488 (1982).

  

This reminds me a sloka from Odia :

  

" Kari KarAu thAe Muhin

Mo binA Ana kehi nAhin"



In English :

  

I make things and do things, there is nobody besides me.

  

I do not claim any originality of the ablove Odia sloka except to point out how close it is to what Fenman said in 1982.

  

Although there is a big difference between concepts and actuality both are important in the quest of humans to know nature.

  

I take back my questions regarding the antiquity of Sanskrit language which undoubtedly contains the key to understanding nature a little bit more.

  

Happy Holidays and a very Happy New Year to all.  

  

Best Regards

Deva

  

Happy Holidays and a very Happy New Year to all.
