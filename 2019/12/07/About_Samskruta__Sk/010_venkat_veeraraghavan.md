Dear Shri Pattanayak ji,  

  

I appreciate your interest and questions.

My point is very simple...questions of all sorts are welcome.

  

We however need to be very careful in lecturing to the real men of knowledge especially since this group has a few Ghanapaatis and Mahamahopadhyayas who represent the acme of knowledge in their fields and professors who have 30-40 years of teaching experience.

  

Please do not bottle up your questions.

  

My only request is that you realise that different paradigms function on different rules. We have to be mindful of the rules surrounding Veda its adhyayana and prayoga before we seek to make links.

  

The other issue here apart from the raw knowledge is the issue of yoga or vak-yoga as Shri Sastry garu is fond of pointing out. This aspect seems to have died out in mainstream Vedic culture.

Any people well versed in this field keep themselves well hidden.

  

Kind Regards,

  

Venkat
