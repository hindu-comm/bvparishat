This argument begins to fail in manyways... First, Shri Pattanaik says, Vedas were 'written' in some language, not necessarily Sanskrit. First, Vedas are a 'Sruti', which means people viewed them in their higher level of consciousness. Nobody 'wrote' Vedas. They always exist. Second, the Rishis or 'Dhrashtas' who viewed and experienced them further explained to them to common folk in Sanskrit. This was before Panini and Patanjali, since Vedas were always present, and are going to be present, around us. Third, many Rishis have thus experienced Vedas themselves. Their names are in both Vedas and Upanishads. They all expressed their experienced form of Vedas in Sanskrit only. The writing of Sanskrit may be a receint phenomenon, but Sanskrit is old, as in Sanatana. Panini codified the language so it could be used by a large population for non-Vedic purposes. Sanskrit further strengthened other regional languages in India. Most Indian languages have Sanskrit influence in them, and you can trace the 'before Sanskrit/after Sanskrit' status of these languages. This is true of Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, Odia, Maratha, etc. Sanskrit was the true link language in the subcontinent. If you look at most dhatus of Sanskrit, you will see a rational, 'from nature' aspect. This includes Ashtadhyaayi.

  

I am sorry, but may be you would kindly like to re-examine your premise?
