\<\<I have seen in Bangalore a bus/van actually sporting this formbut with a special word-split, perhaps to facilitate reading :  
S'rI**madAnanda**tIrtha ! :\>\>

  

श्रीमत् + शरच्चन्द्र = श्रीमच्छरच्चन्द्र

  

I remember one person telling the episode that a Pandit wrote a letter addressed toशरच्चन्द्र चटर्जी as श्रीमच्छरच्चन्द्र. The postman was searching this person for delivering him the letter, but was unable to trace him. When the postman enquired one person, he replied:इधर कोई मच्छरचन्द नहीं रहता !
