While looking at the examples of श्री+ vowels without sandhi, it occurs to me that Panini himself notes a similar case, namely that of ॐ.
Panini's rule ओमाङोश्च provides for a pararūpa sandhi for ॐ and आ(ङ्), when these come after अ/आ. Thus, शिवाय+ॐ \> शिवायोम्, rather than शिवायौम्. This way, the phonetic shape of the auspicious syllable ॐ is not disturbed by sandhi rules.
