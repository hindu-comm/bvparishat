With the honorific S'rImatI for women,

a woman named S'rImatI would be referred to as

S'rImatI S'rImatI.  

  

We use a dot after Mr as it is an abbreviation.

Do we need a dot after S'rI? Or S'rImAn/S'rImatI?

  

Can we escape our dilemmas by using a new notation

\- a hyphen after the Indian honorifics  

S'rI/S'tImAn/S'rImatI?

In which case, we will have S'rI-EkAmres'vara-svAmI.

  

Else, we'll've to do sandhi,

which may not sound easy on the ears.
