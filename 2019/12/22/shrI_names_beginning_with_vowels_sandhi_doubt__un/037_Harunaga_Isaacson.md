Several examples without sandhi have already been given from pre-modern Sanskrit texts, so from the point of view of the original question it is not at all necessary to give more; but in case there might be someone who is collecting such examples, here (I hope the images will be properly visible) are nonetheless two which seem not yet to have been given, one from Viśveśvara's Camatkāracandrikā (a work written in Āndhra in the first half of the fourteenth century), and one from the Jaina author Saṅghatilaka's Sanskrit retelling of Haribhadra's Prakrit Dhuttakkhāṇa (= Sanskrit Dhūrtākhyāna). This Sanskrit version as edited by A.N. Upadhye is in fact, as the most learned editor tells us, extracted from Saṅghatilaka's commentary Tattvakaumudī on Haribhadra's Samyaktvasaptatikā; and this commentary was finished during Dīpotsava in the year 1422 of the Vikrama era, so that this work is from the second half of the fourteenth century.

In both cases the metre confirms the absence of sandhi.
