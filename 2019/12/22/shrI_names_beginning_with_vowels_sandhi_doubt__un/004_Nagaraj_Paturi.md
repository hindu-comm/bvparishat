Confusing the s'rI in s'rImat as a separate entity leads to similar hilarious situation here in Telugu too.

  

Names of books like s'rImadAndhramahAbhAratamu s'rImat + Andhra + mahAbhAratamu

  

are often split as s'rI + madAndhramahAbhAratamu. I keep telling them that there is no mada Andhra or mAtsarya Andhra.
