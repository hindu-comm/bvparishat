Thank you, Dr. Irene.

I referred to tragi-comic situations as actually obtaining  

\- and hence needing attention, care, and remedy.  

It was by no means derisive in intention or effect.

  

Members of the List, it's expected, take words in the right, intended, spirit.

  

Can the words of Prof Paturi be construed as anti-Andhra  

by any stretch of imagination?
