Namaste,

  

This is slightly off-topic. It seems there is typo in the quote '*छन्दोभङ्गं त्यजेद्गिराम्*'. It may be any of the following.

  

छन्दोभङ्गं त्यजेद्गिरम् or छन्दोभङ्गे त्यजेद्गिरम् or छन्दोभङ्गे त्यजेद्गिराम्. Mallinatha's tika on Kumarasambhava 4.16 contains \`अपि माषं मषं कुर्याच्छन्दोभङ्गे त्यजेद्‌गिरम्'.   

  

regards  
shankara
