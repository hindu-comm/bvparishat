In a slightly lighter vein:

It is fine to do the sandhi between S'rImad & Ananda-tIrtha.

But care should be taken while writing the sandhied form.

  

I have seen in Bangalore a bus/van actually sporting this form  

but with a special word-split, perhaps to facilitate reading :

S'rI **madAnanda**tIrtha ! :

illustrating the dangers of creating word-space  

as soon as one sees S'rI !

  

An almost similar instance is of the work of ParAs'ara-bhaTTa.

The actual work is S'rI-guNa-ratna-kos'a

(dealing, that is, with the many merits of S'rI=Vis"n"patnI).

People sometimes err - referring to it as guNa-ratna-kos'a,

assuming the S'rI at the beginning as a mere honorific!
