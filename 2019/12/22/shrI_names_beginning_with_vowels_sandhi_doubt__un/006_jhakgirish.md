Respected Professor Deshpande,

संहितैकपदे नित्या नित्या धातूपसर्गयोः।

नित्या समासे वाक्ये तु सा विवक्षामपेक्षते।।

Keeping in mind this traditional कारिका I would like to say that श्री in श्री आञ्जनेय is

Bound in this Compound word.श्री युतः आञ्जनेयः इति विग्रहे शाखपार्थिवादित्वात् समासे

श्री आञ्जनेयःइति।Hence it must be combined

In sandhi.I have seen many old Grammarians using श्र्यङ्कम् शिशुपालवधम् इति।

As such श्र्याञ्जनेयम् might be साधु।But this type of usage I could not find in the literature.Also it appears श्रुतिकटु।If some scholars use without सन्धि I go unresponsive.
