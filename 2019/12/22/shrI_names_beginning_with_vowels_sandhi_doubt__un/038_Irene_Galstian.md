"Taking Sri Madhvacharya′s name and making fun is not suited for a scholar. And saying this should be taken as fun shows no difference between a person who directed PK Bollywood movie and a scholar. A real scholar will never read even by mistake as sri mada etc. who is trained himself enough reading the manuscripts."

  

Forgive me, but this criticism isn't appropriately directed. If you fear the demise of Madhva's name at the hands of people like Prof Kannan, Madhva and his name are safe indeed.

Let's fix what needs fixing and leave the rest alone.
