Namaste

Before making final conclusion on ‘ vi-sandhi’-

Please explore the section titled ‘ rules of prakruti- bhaava-sandhi’ .

Also the grammarians convention on when sandhi is optional! ( - nitya versus vikalpita).

On top of it, the license of freedom for poet.

  

There are internal exceptions to apply and demand compliance with the yardstick of ‘ bhashaa’ rules of sandhi , .

  

The unfailing justification to push the usage as ungrammatical ( vaidika -joking ) shishta prayoga, out of sanskrit boundary is always available!


  

The use of नारायण -नारेयण in karnataka/ kaivara is a good example.

  

Regards
