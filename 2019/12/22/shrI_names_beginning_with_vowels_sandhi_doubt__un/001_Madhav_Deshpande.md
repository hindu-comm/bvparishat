Dear Nagaraj Ji,

  

  In a 1993 article, I had studied the use of honoricŚrī in a large number of inscriptions, and one section of the article studies the occurrence or non-occurrence of śrī with names beginning with vowels.
Except in a few cases, especially with names beginning with "i", the word śrī is left without sandhi. Particularly with ānandatīrtha, I see the usage of śrīmat, rather than śrī by itself.
