Dear colleagues,

  

Could you please provide me with some material--both in the original and secondary sources-- on Ramaraya Kavi. I need to prepare an entry for Bloomsbury Encyclopedia in Indian Philosophy. I only have his *Siddhantasindhu* and a damaged copy of *Sankara-asankara Vimarsha*

With regards,
