Dear RNI Sir,

  

Thank you for responding, yes "Nandi" is a part of it so can't name the whole.

  

I'm looking for a general (Sanskrit) term that would represent (devine) Vehicles or cover the whole of Lord Shiva family, specifically their Vahana-s.  

  

With lesser choices because of my limited knowledge of Shastra, I'm inclined for "पशुपति (Pashupati)" because,  

Pahsu - perfectly fits for the bird/animal as their divine vehicles

Pati - in this context means Shiva, so it covers the entire family  

  

I'm sorry for not posting the design picture here. There is no secret about it, as it will be published on our [website](https://shastrakrida.org/playthings/dashavatara/) but it will take time, till we iron out any manufacturing issues.  

  

Regards,

Sunil
