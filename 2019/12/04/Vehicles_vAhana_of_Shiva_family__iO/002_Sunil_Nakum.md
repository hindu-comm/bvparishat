Namaskar Professor Kannan,

  

Thank you for the quick and crisp response.  

No, I did not come across this before, moreover I could not get the source of this verse. I'll dig deeper into it, please share the source in case you have it handy.  

So this verse is giving support to Lion as mount to Gauri.
