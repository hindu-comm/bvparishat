Yes, Sir with the help of Google!

  

“His snake, stricken with hunger, tries to eat Ganesa’s mouse.  
Kartikeya’s peacock tries to eat the snake, and Gauri’s lion tries to eat Ganesa himself.  
Gauri envies Ganga, and the fire on his forehead envies the moon.  
Disturbed by household quarrel, Lord Siva drank poison!”
