नमस्ते विदवेभ्यो,

  
For a kids toy project, we are working on different vehicles/mounts or iconography relevant to the Shiva family. It will shape into something like what we earlier worked on for Dashavatara wooden puzzle, the final outcome can be seen [here](https://shastrakrida.org/playthings/dashavatara/).  
  
Vahana (vehicles) or Iconography associated with Shiva family,  
1. Shiva - Nandi / Nag  
2. Ganesha - Mouse  
3. Kartikeya/Skanda/Murugan – Peacock  
  
4. Parvati - Lion or Tiger?  
I have confusion about the vehicle of Aadi Shakti in the form of Goddess Parvati, as she is represented with both Lion & Tiger as her mount. Also in her nine different forms of Navadurga her mount changes, mostly Lion,Tiger and Bull but as a special case of Godess MahaKali she is seen riding a Donkey (Navadurga by Gita Press, Gorakhpur).  
Is there any concrete reference to zero-in whether it should be Lion or Tiger or both for Ma Parvati?  
  
5. Ashoka Sundari - ?  
She is often depicted iconographically as seated on a lotus.. (Wikipedia)  
As per Vamakeshvara Tantra,  
Ashoka Sundari (Tripura Sundari) is said to have Bull as her mount, a snake as a garland around her neck, etc.  
Since Bull or Snake will be same as in case of Shiva, we are looking for any other iconography related to her. This leaves only one option of Lotus, in my knowledge. Any information or pointers regarding this will be very helpful.
