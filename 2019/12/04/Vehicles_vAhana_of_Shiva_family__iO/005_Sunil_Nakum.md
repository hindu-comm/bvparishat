Dear all,

  

The concept design is ready and now I'm looking for a suitable name. Since, it is about the Vahana's of Lord Shiva Family, I'm pondering on following options, please provide your valuable feedback/suggestions.  
  
शिव + वाहन (Shiva + Vahana) - vehicles of shiva  
पशुपति (Pashupati) - lord of animals  
  
To my choice a name (that too of a toy) suites best in single word, so I'm left with only one option of Pashupati. Kindly suggest for any other possibilities.

  

Regards,

Sunil
