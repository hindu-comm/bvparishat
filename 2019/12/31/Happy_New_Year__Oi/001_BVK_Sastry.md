Namaste



विंशतिर्विंशतिश्चेति वत्सरो शुभदो भवेत् \|

योग-संस्कृतभूयिष्ठां समदर्शनभावनाम् ॥



The upcoming year with numeric designation '**Twenty-Twenty** (2020), may bestow for all an auspicious, balanced clear vision enriched with 'Yoga-Samskrutham,':: The culture and language of Yoga'.



(Note: **Twenty-twenty** is an idiom-expression. It is used is sight testing ( darshana through the indriya:Chakshu). Visual acuity is usually measured with a Snellen chart. Snellen charts display letters of progressively smaller size. "Normal" Clear vision is 20/20. Yoga and Samskrutham helps to refine and clear the vision for better comprehension.)
