**Respected Scholars,**

**Below is the Shloka from ShrimadBhagavatam, which is called as “व्यूह श्लोक”and is also considered as important :**

**नमस्तुभ्यम् भगवते वासुदेवाय धीमहि ।**

**प्रद्युम्नायानिरुद्धाय नम: संकर्षणाय च ।।**

**                 (१.१.३७)**

**It contains four names of Vishnu. I couldn’t understand why it is called so.**

**  
**

**Also, below is the very first shloka of the Venkatesh Stotra recited in Maharashtra and southern India, which contains the same four names:**

**व्यंकटेशो वासुदेव: प्रद्युम्नोमितविक्रम:।**

**संकर्षणोनिरुद्धश्च शेषाद्रिपतिरेव च ।।**

**  
**

**I request Scholars to clarify what is the significance of व्यूह.**

**  
**

**I sincerely wish all Members and their families a Very Happy New Year 2020 !!**

**-Ashok Gudsoorkar.**
