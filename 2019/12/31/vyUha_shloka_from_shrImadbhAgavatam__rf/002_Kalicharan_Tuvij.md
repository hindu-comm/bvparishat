Namaste,  

  
नमस्तुभ्यम् भगवते वासुदेवाय धीमहि ।  
प्रद्युम्नायानिरुद्धाय नम: संकर्षणाय च ।।  
  

Vishnu being a purusha deva, there are many devata-s that are parts of Vishnu the purusha deva.  
  
Out of those devata-s, four get exalted as prototypical devata-s of the purusha. The reason why this is so can only be transmitted by an adept in person. At the onset, however, such grouping can be said akin, but not equal, to Shiva-parivAra for Shiva the purusha, etc.  
  
Out of these exalted four, one is, in secret, still elevated over the others: residing in the very heart of the purusha.  
  
This heart is not brahman.
