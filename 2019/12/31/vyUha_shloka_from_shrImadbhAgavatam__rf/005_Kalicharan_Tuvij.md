A G ji,

  

 Not interpretation per se, but more of an observation & acknowledgement of the inner consistency and depth of things.

 "Brahman bhakti is different from Vishnu bhakti at the core. Both are true, but also different." --this is what I meant specifically.

 The nature of things accomodates many infinites. For example in three dimensional space we see before us three independent infinites: length, width and height(or depth) of space.

 Ultimately, the mantra-s of Veda establish the degrees of freedom, interrelationships and types/names of these svayambhu-s.

 Many people interpret such matters in the context of comparative mythology, or of linguistics, or deities as historical tribal lords, or as aspects (mask) of some other deity; all this is serious bad karma, given that there is so much complexity and depth out there for anyone to see-experience.

 regds.
