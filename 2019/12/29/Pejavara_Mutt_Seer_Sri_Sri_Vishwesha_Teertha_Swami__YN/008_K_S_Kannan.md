Revered Swamiji was a great visionary. He could see through events and read between lines. Few can match him in his skill in handling people of varied backgrounds and putting them on a right track.

  

I had the fortune of getting his blessings on many occasions, and even giving one or two talks in his presence. In my younger days, I had attended his talks on Visnu-tattva-vinirNaya.

  

His efforts in engendering scholarship and establishing institutions have few equals. His own talks were marked by brief sentences and abundant examples that easily appealed even to the lay.

  

A veritable model for many Swamiji-s of the present and the future.

  

Our humble salutations to the departed seer.
