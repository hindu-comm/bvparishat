Dear Sunil,

  

In Buddhist Sanskrit usage, the word kaṣāya is often used in the sense of impurities:

(= Skt. id., BR s.v. 2c; Pali kasāya),*sediment*, and so*impurity,degradation*, etc.: five such, āyuḥ-, dṛṣṭi-, kleśa-, sattva-, kalpa-k° Mvy 2335--40; (order varies) Dharmas 91; SP 43.4--5; Bbh 252.17--19; pañcakaṣāya-kāleSP58.11; LV 248.13; pañcasu kaṣāya-kāle LV 257.21 (vs); pañcakaṣāye loke Śikṣ 60.14; pañcakaṣāye kāle buddho…śākyamunir utpannaḥ Mmk 5.23; kaṣāyakālaḥ Bbh 15.3; ahaṃ (sc. the Buddha)…utpanna sattvāna kaṣāyamadhye SP 56.8 (vs); see also s.v.kalpakaṣāya; in vs m.c. forkāṣāya, q.v., KP 117.5 (twice,oncein text, the other time required by meter for text kāṣāya); five k° in a differentsense,*astringent substances*(as Skt.), products of five plants, MSV i.iv.5.

  

If such is the meaning of kaṣāya, the word antas-tyakta-kaṣāya can mean "one who has gotten rid of the impurities inside oneself."

  

The Pali Dhammapada has a play on the word kāsāva \[Skt. kaṣāya/kāṣāya\]. It has two different meanings, 1) impurity, and 2) red robes for the monk. The Dhammapada verse says:

  

anikkasāvo kāsāvaṃ yo vatthaṃ paridahessati /

apeto dhammasaccena na so kāsāvam arahati //

  

"If a person who has not become free from impurities wears the red robes, that person, removed from dharma and satya, does not deserve the red robes."

  

Here, the word a-nikkasāva (Skt. a-niṣ-kaṣāya\] is used in the sense of one who is not free from impurities.

  

Among the many meanings for kaṣāya, Apte's dictionary cites dirt, uncleanness, dulness, stupidity, attachment to worldly objects, passion and emotion. Among the examples cited by Apte, there are two that are relevant: vigata-bhaya-kaṣāya-lobha-mohaḥ and bhaktyā nirmathitāśeṣa-kaṣāya-dhiṣaṇo 'rjunaḥ. These are somewhat similar to your antas-tyakta-kaṣāya.
