Dear learned ones,

  

In the followinglines from Ashtavakra Gita (3:14), I need help in deriving the meaning of the compound wordअंतस्त्यक्तकषायस्य?

  

**अंतस्त्यक्तकषायस्य **निर्द्वन्द्वस्य निराशिषः ।  

यदृच्छयाऽगतो भोगो न दुःखाय न तुष्टये ॥ ३-१४॥

  

An old translated book version gives the meaning of the compound to be something like "*of one who has given up the idea of worldly attachment from their mind*". I can't seem to break up the compound to equate to the meaning given. Help appreciated.

  

Sunil
