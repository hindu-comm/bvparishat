Dear Vidvans,

  

I am interested in learning if there is a reliable record /mention of on what day/tithi / nakshatra etc authors started their composition work.

Most books on muhurta seem to have reliable tithis etc for agriculture, war, study, mantra deeksha etc but seem to have left this common activity out which seems surprising.

  

Any light you can throw on this matter is greatly appreciated!

  

Thanks,

  

Venkat
