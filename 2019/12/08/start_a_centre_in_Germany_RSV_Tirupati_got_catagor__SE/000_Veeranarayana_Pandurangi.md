Here is the announcement that RSV Tirupati got catagory 1 autonomy. It means they can start any new course hire foreign faculty and students, start off campus centers etc.

  

I urge RSVP to start one off campus center in Germany to teach them right samskrit because everyone is thinking in india that more research is done in Germany than in india.
