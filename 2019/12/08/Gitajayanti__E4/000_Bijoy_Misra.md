Friends,

Today happens to the lunar day of Gitajayanti. I would hope all scholars in this group

would champion the Gita as a text of freedom and independent analytic thinking.

We still do not know how the text was composed or how it connected to SriKrishna.

I just love the poetry and the mathematical simplicity. I speak today.

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
