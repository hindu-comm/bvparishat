Dear friends,

  

Most of my transition to study India at a late age was motivated by Swami Sarvagtananda,

who served as a resident monk in Ramakrishna Vedanta Society in Boston and also served

as religious counselor at MIT. Like all bright students during the colonial times, he began

life as an accountant in Bombay and relinquished it to be a monk. He worked in a hospital

in Kankhal in the Himalayas as an apprentice and then served the Ramakrishna Mission in Karachi during the turbulent period of partition. He came to Boston in 1954 and died here

in 2009. He was 97.

  

My association with him began in 1978 during a relief event in MIT for the Andhra cyclone  

victims that Fall. He helped my son to get into music (my son became an opera singer) and offered his library to me to create curriculum on India for the immigrant children school I was organizing. By being in MIT, he had association in science and mathematics and incorporated modern cosmological ideas to Vedanta. I did work with him during the last fifteen years of his  

life to edit some of his lectures and publish them. I particularly wish to draw attention to a  

short book on the Gita we got out in 2005. It is being distributed from RKM, Cheenai.

Though the book is selling well, I don't see a review. Interested scholars may read and

put a review on the book. Amazon also sells it. There are more books listed there.  

  

More on the swami is at <https://www.swamisarvagatananda.org/>

a website I created in 2016.

  

I thought to pay tribute to a teacher.

  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
