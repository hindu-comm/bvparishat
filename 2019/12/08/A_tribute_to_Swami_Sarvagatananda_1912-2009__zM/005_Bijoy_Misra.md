Dear Sri Venkataraman,

If you wish to seriously pursue, start doing an experiment to observe your mind.

Yoga bases itself on the principle that the human has the capacity to "know"

objects as they exist and it is the mind that colors our knowledge. You may  

try to convince yourself on this basic foundation. Most cultures and religions

reject this. They argue that the mind is a part of the body. Yoga enunciation

is different: mind is separate from the body and can be controlled (cleaned).  

Without arguing with others, you can observe yourself to check this foundation.  

It may take years, and you may need to be with a live teacher.

Teachers are not easy to find, actually they find us. I don't know the process,  

but the opportunity to learn would show up if you keep looking. In my case,

I happened to meet a seemingly lay person who had just relocated to the US

after losing his wife. He met me in connection with the admission of his  

daughter to the local graduate school. This was 1984. He was a master yogi,  

totally unassuming. His name was Dr V S Rao and he came from Andhra Pradesh.

He belonged to a group in Amritsar and linked to the mysterious Babaji apparently

living in the deep Himalayas. We initiated hatha yoga training here and I learned  

Paranayama from him. He became a popular teacher and taught several hundred  

local students till very late age. Many of his students have their own schools

now. He passed away in 2008 at 88. We made an organization but he did not

want it continued. Nothing bothered him in the world. He didn't want any trace

left of his work. I made a website for my class and acknowledged him and his

teacher Yogi Ramlal. You can know more of these activities at

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
