One particular trait of human response I learnt from the Swami was to be able

to state "I don't know." Not that one can't know, but the current state of  

one's knowledge might not permit an answer Our depth of understanding

something increases as we work our way through the problem. More we know,

there is always more left to know. So generalizing from any point to the  

uncultivated areas is an abuse of one's own intellect.

I saw the beauty of this argument when I was briefed on it in 1983 and spent  

the next several years in churning the two volume text of Eight Upanisads  

compiled by Swami Madhavananda. I strongly recommend these to anyone

who has scientific and mathematical training. I read the texts in original

Sanskrit ten years later when I took upon the task of helping doctoral students

at Harvard.  

Socrates is known in the world for his style of teaching. The upanisads go a

step higher. We date the upanisads some centuries before Socrates, but I  

have not researched on to the subject.
