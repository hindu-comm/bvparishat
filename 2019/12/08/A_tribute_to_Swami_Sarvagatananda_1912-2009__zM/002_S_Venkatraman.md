Namaste Misraji,

  

Thanks a lot for your mail. Through it, I came to know about this great Swamiji. Since reading your mail, I have done quite a lot of reading about Swami Sarvagatanandaji from materials available on the net.

  

I have always wanted to do an in-depth study of Patanjali’s Yoga Sutras and have been wondering which of the several books available on the subject should be my starting point. I found while browsing about the Swamiji, that he has also written a very elaborate commentary on Yoga Sutras which is published in 2 Volumes running to about 1600 pages. I also read that these volumes are edited by you. I have so far not done any serious study of Yoga Sutras apart from reading some articles and mails on it. Would you recommend the Swamiji’s magnum opus to me as the first book for the study of Yoga Sutras? Or should I graduate to it, after reading something simpler on the subject - if so, what would that simpler text be?

  

Many thanks in advance for your advise. Regards,

  

Venkat
