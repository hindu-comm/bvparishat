New addition to this

  

\*Namaskaram!!\* It gives me great pleasure to be back before you with the \*# Episode 4 of 'Bhakti Bicchamiyyave',\* an exclusive Web Series on the Compositions of Sadguru Thyagaraja \*based on the theme 'Bhakti'.\* Due to some reasons beyond our control, there was a gap in posting the the 4th Episode. In this episode, \*Dr. Duddu Radhika\* has discussed and presented the composition \*"Padavi Ni Sadbhaktiyu Galgute"\* in the raga Salaga Bhairavi, set to Adi Talam. Please listen, like & Share the video. Also \*subscribe to the youtube channel\* and click on the 'Bell' Button to get notified of the future videos. Thank you!! <https://youtu.be/3VdobeHiymg>
