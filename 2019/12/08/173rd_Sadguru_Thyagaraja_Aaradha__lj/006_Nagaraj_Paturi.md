Namaskaram!! I am happy to share the # 5th Episode of 'Bhakti Bicchamiyyave', an exclusive Web Series on the Compositions of Sadguru Thyagaraja based on the theme 'Bhakti'. In the last 4 episodes, Dr. Duddu Radhika presented compositions in which Thyagaraja Begs Sri Rama to grant him Rama Bhakti and extols the greatness of Rama Bhakti, its importance to mankind & firmly states that the status of an individual lies alone in the True devotion to God.  
In this episode, She presents the composition ‘Appa Rama Bhakti’ in the raga Pantuvarali, which talks about the greatness of Rama Bhakti. Please listen, like & Share the video. Do also subscribe to the youtube channel and click on the 'Bell' Button to get notified of the future videos. Thank you!!
