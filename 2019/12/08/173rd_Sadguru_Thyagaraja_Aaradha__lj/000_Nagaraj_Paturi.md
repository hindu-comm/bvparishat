ðŸ‘†ðŸ‘†ðŸ‘†\*Namaskaram!!\*

  

\*173rd Sadguru Thyagaraja Aaradhana\* is fast approaching and it is this time when all the Musicians & Music Lovers come together to pay tributes to this greatest composer of Carnatic Music. Everyone knows that Thyagaraja's compositions are an \*epitome of jnAna, bhakti and Ananda i.e., True Knowledge, highest order of Bhakti and Bliss\* .
Thyagaraja strongly believes that utmost devotion (bhakti) is pre requisite for jnAna and He mentions in few of his compositions that \*one who does not have bhakti in his heart cannot get real knowledge.\* Knowledge of Music coupled with true devotion alone can lead to the right path of self realization.

  

It is in this context that I would like to humbly discuss & present a few compositions of Sadguru Thyagaraja Swamy, which have \*primarily stressed on â€˜Bhaktiâ€™ , its qualities and importance to mankind.\* through a web series of video presentations titled \*"Bhakti Bicchamiyyave"\*, which will be posted \*every Monday starting from 9th December 2019.\* Through his compositions, I pray Bhagawan Sri Rama to shower his grace on me to have such devotion at his lotus feet.

  

Request you to stay connected with me through this journey and send me your good wishes and blessings!! â€“ \*Dr. Duddu Radhika\*
