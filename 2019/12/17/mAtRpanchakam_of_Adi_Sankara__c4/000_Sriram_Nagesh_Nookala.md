Namaste,

I am looking forमातृपञ्चकम् of Adi Sankara.There seem to be two versions of mAtripanchakam in Sanskrit both attributed to Adi Sankara. Some say one of them is by Adi Sankara and the other version was written by one of the Swami Saccidananda.

  

  

Version #1: In Sanskrit documents this is attributed to Adi Sankara.<https://sanskritdocuments.org/doc_z_misc_shankara/mAtripanchakam.html?lang=sa>

Version #2: Other website attributes this to Adi Sankara<https://ahambrahmasmi4.wordpress.com/2016/05/08/matrupanchak/>

  

Can anyone point to which of them is by Adi Sankara?

  

Thanks

Nagesh
