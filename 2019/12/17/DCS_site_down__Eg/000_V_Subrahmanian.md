Namaste

  

The Digital Corpus of Sanskrit (DCS):  

  

<http://www.sanskrit-linguistics.org/dcs/>

  

This site is down for maintenance for the last three days.

  

Any idea if a mirror site or any other site of this facility is working? It first said 'it will be up in a few hours' but this status is unchanged till now.

  

There seems to be DCS at github -<https://github.com/cltk/sanskrit_text_dcs>  

  

Could anyone help me access the above and use the same for searching purposes?

  

Thanks and regards
