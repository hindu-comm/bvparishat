Dear Sir,

  

Thank you for the definitions you have provided.

  

I would like to bring just one thing to your notice here. A planet is very different from a Graha within this context. A planet cannot have vakra drishti or even drishti, but a Graha does.

  

In this era of confusion it is important to use the right terminology so that our own understanding and that of others does not suffer in consequence.

  

The second point is most of the books you have suggested are magnum opuses of their class and will frankly scare away a newbie trying to find definitions.

  
All the best,

  

Thanks,

  

Venkat
