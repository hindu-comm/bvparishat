Respected scholars,

  

Occasionally when I come across jyotishya terms such as "lagna", "sva-sthana", "uccha-sthana", "vakra-drushti", "asta", "pravesha of one graha into a nakshatra" etc, I have no understanding of them. I tried reading introductory pages of a few basic astrology books, but they seem to assume that the reader is aware of these terms.

I request you to kindly inform me of the books or other resources that can help me understand these terminologies so that I get a basic understanding of the concepts. (I would find it easier to read and use if the book uses Indian names such as Surya instead of Sun)

  

-Pradyumna
