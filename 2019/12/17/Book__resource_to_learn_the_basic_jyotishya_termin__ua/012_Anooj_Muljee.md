hariḥ om

Namaste Venkat Mahodaya,

  

I see your message now and I believe your mail was actually in response to my mail.

  

Generally speaking, when we say the word« planet », it is implied graha (the 7 physical planets + nodes of the Moon\|RāhuKetu = navagraha), and their function is w.r.t. astrology and in general **no planet aspects by the reverse i.e., no graha turn their head to see backwards**. Those physical planets have consciousnessin them to run the world and the nodes are nothing but two extreme ends having our karmic impressions stored from previous lives (to be disbursed in this life) while the moon is the present life's consciousness. How much you raise to go up and how much you get grounded here is essentially what the nodes are. After all everything is a product of the Mind (hence moon transit is of prime importance).

  

A well-known scholar SureshChandra Mishra whose interview is available over YouTube, once stated this:

> Retrograde-planet never renders its Dṛṣṭi backwards.

  

Knowledge can only grows the more it is shared and what I have to state on this is thus: Only exception that I know is Rāhu's i.e., since it is always VakrīCari, hence it is essentially stepping backwards in its path. Because of this, His 12th aspect is 2H i.e., should Vakrī Rāhu be in 10H→ He is aspecting in reverse in the 12H and that would be in 2H from itself = the 11H. Admittedly, some schools use different aspect schemes, but this is what I consider too and have used this scenario to illustrate the only possible case where aspect in reverse which I am aware of.

  

> A planet cannot have vakra drishti or even drishti, but a Graha does.

However, since you are stating something new, please enlighten me on this. Which are the Graha(s) other than Rāhu that aspect in the reverse? Ketu is without dṛṣṭi on its own, to my knowledge.

I would love to discuss more of those confusions and what are your views on what is right and wrong on the different concepts. In case you got a blog, you could write about them and share the link to me in private.

Though that is true, but that is ultimately where the knowledge resides.

Best Wishes,
