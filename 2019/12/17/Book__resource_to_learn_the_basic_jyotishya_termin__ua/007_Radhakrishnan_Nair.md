The Best Book seems good for you is; ‘Jyothisha Gurubhoothan’ by Sri K. C. Kesava Pillai.

Before beginning learning the Book, if possible visit Sree Mookambika Temple, have a dip in Souparnika,

and do an offering to Devi with focused prayers, get the ‘Strings’ (chuvanna charadu), blessed by the Chief Priest .

Namaste



You can try B.V Raman's books on Astrology which has basics. The name of the Book is "Astrology for beginners"



Bruhat Parashara Hora Shastra can also be read. Hope this helps.
