1.  Lagna: Generally termed as the ascendant (it's technically the
    spining of the earth on its own axis) and is of several types
    (vi-lagna is a term as such used in classics) and is to be taken as
    the reckoning point. Several such lagnas are Udaya-Lagna,
    Janma-Lagna (Moon sign), Ārūḍha-Lagna, Divya-Lagna, Śrī-Lagna,
    Upapada-Lagna, Bhāva-Lagna, Navāṁśa-Lagna etc. Subsequently,
    Parāśara has primarily spoken of 3 Lagnas: Sūrya Lagna, Candra/Janma
    Lagna, and Udaya Lagna. Quoting Dr. Suresh Chandra Mishra, in one of
    his interview He said:  
      

    > If alluded to a metaphor:Sun is the Foundation of a
    > Building;Moon's, its Inner strength — Damp Proof Course
    > whileUdaya Lagna represents the outer coating of that Building.

    

    

    

2.  SvaSthāna: It translates to own sign. In the order of the weekdays
    (Sun for Sunday, Moon for Monday etc.), the navagrahas rule over
    Sun\|Leo, Moon\|Cancer, Mars\|Aries & Scorpio, Mercury\|Gemini &
    Virgo, Jupiter\|Sagittarius & Pisces, Venus\|Taurus & Libra,
    Saturn\|Capricorn & Aquarius. And these are termed as their own
    signs respectively. However, the Nodes (RāhuKetu) lord over Aquarius
    & Scorpio.  
      

3.  UccaSthāna: It translates to the exaltation point and in the order
    of the weekdays (sūryādi), they get exalted in Aries, Taurus,
    Capricorn, Virgo, Cancer, Pisces, Libra. Ancient ṛṣis and scholars
    have enunciated different exalted points for the nodes to serve
    different purpose. This is not being elaborated here because it is
    too advanced concept.  
      

4.  VakraDṛṣṭi: It translates to aspecting in the reverse. Meaning when
    one planetary body is retrograding and is aspecting simultaneously.
    One such planet is Rāhu. According to Dr. SureshChandra Mishra,
    generally for the 7 physical planets, none however aspect in the
    reverse.  
      

5.  Asta: This means setting, however in jyotiṣa it translates to the
    7H. It is however primarily used to mean combustion, meaning when in
    certain proximity to the Sun.  
      

6.  Praveśa: This translates to ingress however in jyotiṣa it is used in
    several places. Like, Nakṣatra-Praveśa, Rāśi-Praveśa, Tithi-Praveśa,
    Vāra-Praveśa. A rāśi is composed of 9 Nakṣatra padas, where 1
    Nakṣatra = 4 padas. Therefore, 1 rāśi is≅ 2¼ nakṣatras.  

Some very good classics to learn & master the Horā part of Jyotiṣa (the science is mainly divided into tri-skandha: ① Saṁhitā ② Horā and ③ Siddhanta) are:

1.  Bṛhat Parāśara Horā Śāstra 2.  JātakaPārijāta by Vaidyanātha Dikṣita 3.  Sārāvalī by KalyaṇaVarma 4.  Laghu & Bṛhaj Jātaka of VārahāMihira (the latter also known as
    VārāhaHorā). Excellent commentaries are available in among Keralites
    scholars. One of the two vyākhyā I have heard of are:  
    ① Daśādhyāyī by Talakkuḻattūr Govindabhaṭṭatiri & ② Hṛdaya Pathā by
    Kaikulaṅgara Rāma Vāryar (warrier) \[Kaikuḻaṅṅara Rāmavāriyar\]. 5.  PhalaDīpikā by Mantreśvara (Mārkaṇḍeya Bhaṭṭar) 6.  Camatkāra Cintāmaṇi byNārāyaṇaBhaṭṭa 7.  Sarvārtha Cintāmaṇi by Veṅkateśa Śarmā  
8.  Mādhavīyam by Puruśottaman Nambūtiri 9.  Muhūrta Padavī byVīraRāghava Ācārya  
10. Kṛṣṇīyam of Kṛṣṇa Ācārya  
11. HorāSāra of PṛthuYaśa (Vārahācārya's son) 12. Bhāvārtha Ratnākara of Rāmānuja (the vaiṣṇava saint)  
13. PraśnaMārga by HariHara (Pālakkaṭ Nārāyaṇan Nambūtiri)

Most are originally in sanskrit, by some have been translated into Hindi, and some even in Engilsh & Mālayālam as well.
