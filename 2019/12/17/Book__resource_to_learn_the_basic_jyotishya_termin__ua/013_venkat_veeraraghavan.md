> A planet cannot have vakra drishti or even drishti, but a Graha does.

However, since you are stating something new, please enlighten me on this. Which are the Graha(s) other than Rāhu that aspect in the reverse? Ketu is without dṛṣṭi on its own, to my knowledge.  

--> My original statement simply means a planet cannot have drishti or vakra-drishti only a graha can have drishti or vakra-drishti....I have not suggested anywhere that grahas apart from Rahu aspect in the reverse.

I would love to discuss more of those confusions and what are your views on what is right and wrong on the different concepts. In case you got a blog, you could write about them and share the link to me in private.

--> Semantics is an aspect of language and communication that is frequently misused in the modern world to deceive and create parallel false narratives (by vested interests) for traditional systems of knowledge and dumb them down to the level of superstition.  

My point about using the right terminology was merely a gentle reminder to use the words used by the Rshis and avoid what we may consider modern "equivalents". This will save a lifetime of pain for both the "vested interests" and any people who have to defend a vidya against the strawmen put forth by its would be detractors.

I don't have a blog or write about the subject but I have some views that you may find interesting.

The actual position of the planets is a physical cosmic marker much alike a pedestrian crossing. When you see the traffic lights on your road turn red, you intuitively know that the pedestrian crossing (perpendicular to this road) will turn green soon and you prepare to cross the road.

Although this example might seem rather simplistic as an analogy for jyotisha it is a useful one to explain the heuristics behind predictive jyotisha.

In the sense of the above analogy, the Grahas and their positions do not "cause" the karma as many modern "rationalists" argue but merely indicate that certain karmas have become imminent.

Graha is also a few degrees more complicated in its nature than merely being thought of as a consciousness to a planet. A Graha is sourced from the Sanskrit world meaning "to hold" which means it is an entity that "holds" awareness and constrains the mind and hence the destiny to play out in specific patterns.

Consider the puranic tale that Ravana had imprisoned all the 9 planets and made steps out of them to his throne. Narada the celestial troublemaker supposedly incites his vanity to make him turn Shani's face over so that Ravana can enjoy his anguish...apparently Ravana's fall started from there.

And then the story of Ravana forcing all the grahas into the 11th house of Meghnaadha's kundali and Shani puts a foot into the 12th which ends in Indrajit's eventual defeat and death.

Now ask yourself this: if what is being discussed is the spirit /consciousness of the planets, shouldnt the invincibility extend to all manifested beings (of that space-time) and not just Ravana and Indrajit?

The answer to the above question is an obvious unqualified NO.

Therefore there is something deeper at work here.

  

When an object is placed in front of a heat source, its thermals, molecular structure and the optics around it change.

A Graha is an entity that "holds" the personality constraining the object (it holds) to certain life patterns. If the object of this influence is capable of modifying the way a graha acts on the body-mind-spirit complex, this equates to having achieved control over the "graha".

This also satisfies the condition that other people within the same space-time do not receive the effect of these "manipulations".

  

So by the above definition, you will agree there is no simple one to one correspondence with planets and grahas. As Krishna would put it: "गहना कर्मणो गतिः"
