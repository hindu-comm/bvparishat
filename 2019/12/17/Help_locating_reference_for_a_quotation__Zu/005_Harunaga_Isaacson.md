As to the context in which it was composed, I have no knowledge, since I have seen the verse only in Jalhaṇa's anthology. As to the meaning, it is roughly this:

  

I and Devanandin (probably the Jaina grammarian, author of theJainendravyākaraṇa), both \[of us\]

have minds as sharp as kuśa grass; \[yet\] we two have not gone (na + aiva) to the farther shore of the ocean of words \[i.e., effectively, of the knowledge about words, śabdavidyā/śabdaśāstra\]; have others, with dull minds, \[then been able to reach that farther shore\]? (Rhetorical question meaning, no, of course others, with dull minds have not been able to reach that.)

Alternatively one may take kim as = kim uta/kiṃ punar, translating something like 'how much less have others, with dull minds, \[been able to reach that farther shore\].

  

With best regards,

  
Harunaga Isaacson
