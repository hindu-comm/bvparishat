Dear Karve_ji,

  

Here is a long answer to your question above.

  

It is obvious from the voluminous work left behind in smriti and written forms, our forefathers knew a lot about nature and living beings, much like what we see today. Like the scientists and philosophers of today, they came to certain understandingof the cosmos and comprehended their place in it. Their knowledgewas passed on from generation to generation by the fascinating texts that goes by the name of Veda, which was monopolized by one class of people called Brahmanas who considered themselves to be seekers of true knowledge. Clearly in the beginning, there were no distinctions between people, but a lot in the nature, the sun, the moon, the water, the air, the sky, the earth. Most of these were macroscopic in nature meaning they are very big in size and shape. In addition the early man experienced the cyclic processes, such as day and night and violent processes such thunder and lightning and the fierceness of fire which can burn things to ashes.

I am not sure, but they must have realized the power of earth to hold them to the earth ( Dharati- that which holds). They also felt that they are different than many other living beings, such as animals and plants. They attributed the difference to their thinking process related to their mind ( manas). The other difference that was obvious to them is the different sense elements, the eyes, the ears, the nose, the legs,the hands, the mouth, the tongue, the teeth, the reproductive and sex organs, the digestive system inside their bellies. Gradually their quest as to know how these organs of them function and work autonomously and continuously. They found that through the process of inhalation and exhalation they are connected to the nature outside,cementing their thinking that everything in nature are connected and interdependent. They also found out that they can control that connectivity not only through breathing but also by thought process. They knew that their thinking is related to their head which is above their neck and very heavy. They also knew that inside their skull is a cavity in which lies some thing very important because when the head is injured they can not some time walk and talk and feel pain and ultimately die. That human organ which si encapsulated by the skull is related to the ability to intellect(buddhi), smarana(memory) and bhasana(talk) is known as mastiska(brain).

I hope I have explained what I mean by brain.

The scientists now know lot about brain, its anatomical structure, neurological architecture, its function etc which was not known during the Vedic times.

I will appreciate if you write in your own words what you understand by brain.

Best Regards

Deva
