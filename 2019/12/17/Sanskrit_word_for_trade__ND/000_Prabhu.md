What would be an appropriate Sanskrit word for "trade"?

  

Looks likeवाणिज्य is used although it seems to be more appropriately "commerce" / "commercial", which is an overarching term that includes trade and other related activities.

Trade is a more narrow term for the "exchange of goods and services".

  

The reason for looking an appropriate Sanskrit equivalent for the word "trade" is to find, ultimately, the appropriate term for "trade winds" which in the old era helped sailors in their trans-oceanic voyages.

  

For the "winds" मारुत would be appropriate, I guess, as in चण्डमारुत, मलयमारुत etc.

  

Thanks and regards,

Prabhu
