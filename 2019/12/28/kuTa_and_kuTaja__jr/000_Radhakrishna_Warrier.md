There is a mountain peak known as Kuṭajādri (കുടജാദ്രി) in Malayalam and Koḍacādri (ಕೊಡಚಾದ್ರಿ) in Kannada near the famous Mookambika temple in Karnataka. In Malayalam, the etymology of the place name is derived from the Kuṭaja flower as the place has plenty of these beautiful flowers that look somewhat like the jasmine. In the Cologne Digital Sanskrit Lexicon it is mentioned that the word also means born in a pitcher. I was under the impression that kuṭa (as in kuṭam) is a Malayalam / Tamil word for pitcher and its Sanskrit equivalent is ghaṭa, but now I learn that kuṭa itself is a Sanskrit word. Is there a cognate of kuṭa in other Indo-European languages or in other Indo-Aryan languages?
