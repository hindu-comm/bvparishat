“Day and night, dawn and dusk, and winter and spring come and go. Time frolics and life ebbs away...”



Yes, time does frolic, and our lives do ebb away.

Another year of the Gregorian calendar will soon be in the books.



Let me wish all a new year of happiness and contentment.



लोकाः समस्ताः सुखिनो भवन्तु

Lokāḥ samastāḥ sukhino bhavantu



May happiness prevail for everyone in the world!

  

Regards,

Radhakrishna Warrier
