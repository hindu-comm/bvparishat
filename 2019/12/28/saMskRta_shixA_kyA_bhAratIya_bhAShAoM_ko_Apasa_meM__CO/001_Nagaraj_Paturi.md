Even Prof. Sheldon Pollock agrees that Sanskrit is a great unifier. He says,

  

"S***anskrit has a 3,000-year history, to use a conservative estimate, and over the course of this history, it has lived many lives, and the most remarkable long-lasting transformative life of Sanskrit has been as a unifier of India, not as a divider, unifying Buddhists and Jains, unifying across social orders. It was not the preserve of a narrow elite of a particular religious community. It was very, very widespread.***

***Not only that but Sanskrit was the engine that helped regional languages reach literacy, literary status across an area far vaster than Europe, all the way to Java and Bali. So you have a history of Sanskrit as a great unifier, and this continued into the 17th-18th centuries, when we have Persian poets who lived side by side with Sanskrit poets.***"

I say, 'even' because he is known for many negative comments about Sanskrit.

  

So if such a person agrees with the unifying ability of Sanskrit, where is the question of people like us disagreeing with that view? is the point.
