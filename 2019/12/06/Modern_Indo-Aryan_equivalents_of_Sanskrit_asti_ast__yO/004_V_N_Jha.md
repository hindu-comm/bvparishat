Dear Professor Deshpande,

  

I share one experience.

  

Once Prof. Suniti Kumar Chatterjee, the great linguist, asked me whether I knew the source of my surname. I told him yes sir, it is upaadhyaaya. He said this is not true because dropping of initial अ is more natural than dropping of initial ओ (once it has become ओझा) in Prakrit. So झा should be derived from अध्यापक. अध्यापक - अज्झाव - झा.

This was his view.

How are you?

  

Best wishes

VNJha
