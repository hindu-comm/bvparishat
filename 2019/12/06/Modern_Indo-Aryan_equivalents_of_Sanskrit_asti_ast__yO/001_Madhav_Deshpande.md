Dear Radhakrishna Ji,

  

  The hindi verb है is ultimately derived from Sanskrit भवतिthrough attested Prakritic changes like हवदि>हवइ>होइ>है. When one looks at the total sequence of changing forms over centuries, one can see what is going on. Otherwise, it is difficult to go directly from Sanskrit to modern Indo-Aryan forms. The modern झा is derived ultimately from Sanskrit उपाध्याय through attested Prakritic changes like उपाध्याय>उवज्झाय>ओज्झा>झा. To see the developments in modern Indo-Aryan, one needs to look at the entire chain of Sanskrit>Prakrit>Apabhraṃśa>NIA.
