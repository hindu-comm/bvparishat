Sanskrit अस्ति (asti) is said to be a cognate of Latin est, Greek esti (ἐστί) and Persian ast (است). What is the equivalent word in Pali and other Prakrits? Modern Indo-Aryan equivalents of “to be" do not seem to be descended from, or cognate of asti. Is it possible to find a Sanskrit / Prakrit or Apabhramsha etymology for modern Indo-Aryan “to be” - such as Hindi hai (है ) Marathi āhe (आहे), and Gujarati che (છે) ? Hindi ho as in ho gayā (हो गया) and Gujarati hove (હોવે) seem to be derived from Sanskrit bhava (probably Prakrit / Apabhramsha hava). Why did a simple word like asti or its Prakrit/Pali equivalent go into disuse and other words came to be used in modern Indo-Aryan?
