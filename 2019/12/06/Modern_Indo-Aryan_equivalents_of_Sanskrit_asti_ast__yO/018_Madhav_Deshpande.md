Dear Nagaraj Ji,

  

  Ralph Turner in his *Comparative Dictionary of Indo-Aryan Languages*(p. 46) connects forms like Marathi आहे to the Vedic verb अक्षेति, and provides intermediate Prakrit and cognate Indo-Aryan forms. The dictionary entree is too long for me to type it here, but If there is interest, I can scan it and post it.
