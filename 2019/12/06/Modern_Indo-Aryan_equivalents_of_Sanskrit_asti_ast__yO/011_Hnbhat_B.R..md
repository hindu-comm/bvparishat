कालिम्ना itself is instrumental of the word derived from काल meaningblack colour कालिमा (काल+इमनिच्) and the Hindi word can be directly derived from काल with Hindi suffix added for being adjective like गौर \> गोर \> गोरा।Hence there is not the necessity of deriving from कलिम्ना which means only blackness and not an adjective.
