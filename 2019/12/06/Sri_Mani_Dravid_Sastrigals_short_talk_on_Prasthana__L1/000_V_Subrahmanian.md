Please listen to Sri Mani Dravid Sastrigal's talk on Prasthana Traya Bhashyam at the recently held Conference on Oneness:In about 20 minutes Sastrigal has summarized the entire Prasthana Traya Bhashya. A wonderful condensation.

  

After his talk there are other talks too on a few topics of Shaankaran literature.
