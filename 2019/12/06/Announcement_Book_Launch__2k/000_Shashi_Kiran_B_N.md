Dear list,

  

Prekshaa Pratishtana takes great pleasure in inviting you to the launch of *Evolution of the Mahabharata and Other Writings on the Epic* by *Nāḍoja* Dr. S R Ramaswamy, *Shiva Rama Krishna* by *Śatāvadhāni* Dr. R Ganesh and Prekshaa Calendar 2020.

  

On: Sunday, 8 December 2019 (10 am to 1 pm)  

  

At: *Gokhale Institute of Public Affairs*, Bull Temple Road, Bengaluru - 560019.

  

*Evolution of Mahabharata and Other Writings on the Epic*is the English translation of S R Ramaswamy's 1972 Kannada classic 'Mahabharatada Belavanige' along with seven of his essays on the great epic. It tells the riveting story of arguably the greatest academic achievement of the twentieth century: preparation of the Critical Edition of the Mahabharata by V S Sukthankar and his team of scholars at the Bhandarkar Institute.

  

*Shiva-Rama-Krishna* is an English adaptation of *Śatāvadhāni* Dr. R Ganesh's popular lecture series on the three great heroes of our tradition. This work focuses on the human values that we can learn from the lives of Shiva, Rama, and Krishna.  
  
The 2020 Prekshaa calendar features exquisite sculptures from the Ellora caves and appropriate Sanskrit verses (along with meaning) for each of these sculptures.

  

This will be followed by a game of Sanskrit poetry based on the classical *Pratimālā* (*Antyākṣarī*).  

  

Please find attached the invitation for the event, cover images of the books, and a sample of the calendar.  

  

Best regards,

Shashi Kiran B. N.,
