The calendar is breathtaking, and I'd also love to buy a copy of the Mahabharata book.

The problem is the same as usual: how to find them and how to deal with shipping to the UK.

How do my chances look?  

  

Best wishes,

Irene

  

PS An unrelated question: how close is SB's Sanskrit translation of Agastya to the Kannada original?
