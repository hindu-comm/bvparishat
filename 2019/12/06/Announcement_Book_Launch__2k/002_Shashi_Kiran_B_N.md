Prof. Irene,

  

Thanks for your kind words of appreciation. We shall make the books available on [amazon.com](http://amazon.com). Since these are English works, the process must not be too tricky. About the Sanskrit translation of Agastya, I have sent you a personal mail.

  

Thank you.

  

Best regards,

Shashi Kiran B N
