Namaste!

I like to thank Sri Venkat, Sri Korada and Sri Murthy for responding to my post. In line with my interest in history of science and pre-siddhāntic astronomy I am editing Vṛddhagārgīya Jyotiṣa. My students had posted previously on BVP about 4 chapters of VGJ published so far. The chapter due to be published is *Tithikarmaguṇa.* This lists ancient names for tithis \[not just pratipat, dvitīyā, tṛtīyā etc.\] and *tithidevatā.*VGJ in other places explains tithi as dependent on the increase and decrease of moon’s brightness. This appears to be the only available ancient text discussing tithi as a time measure from its “concept to quantification”. Since the Vedic roots of tithi - word & meaning- are obscure; I had raised questions about \[tithi, titha, atithi\] previously. Bṛhatsamhitā, a very late text, lists 15 *tithidevatā* but only five tithi names to be repeated thrice. Some gṛhyasūtra texts as I pointed out in my post, talk of tithidevatā with no specifics. Āpastamba (*ayañjanasyasvaśākhā*) does not even refer to *tithi*. Hence I was curious about general *dharmaśāstra* texts. Thanks to Sri Korada for confirming absence of *tithidevatā* in 75 smṛtis. These texts may not remember all ancient principles and practices; smṛti and vismṛti go together. Speculation about tithidevatābased on purāṇic loreis unnecessary. They are available in PT and VGJ. For tṛtīyā it is Viṣṇu; caturthī it is Yama; saptamī it is Saptaṛṣi, for ekādaśī it is Rudra etc.

Thanks

RN Iyengar
