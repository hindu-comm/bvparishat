I am afraid the discussion on Tithi devatas is going in a wrong direction. Each day of Sukla Paksha, and each day of Krishna paksha have Tithi devatas. Their names are mentioned in mantra Saastraas. Please allow me a few days to get some clarifications on how to present their names, and I will do so.

  

Regards,

Krishna Kumar Pillalamarri
