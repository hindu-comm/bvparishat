"I request Dharmaśāstra specialistsand other scholars on the list to enlighten me on how the*tithi iṣṭi*or*homa*is done."

  

Sir: Are you looking for a manual on homa or just the application within this specific context?

If it is the former, you can look for the procedure within the kalpa text relevant to your Shakha.

If it is this particular application of tithi devataa within the context of homa try contacting Sri Gowtham Sarma Mahamkali on this list.
