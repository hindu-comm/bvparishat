The Brown Man's Burden

A varsity scholar is bound to the rules laid by a tax funded State, similarly, even a sanyasi is duty bound to the maTha or Ashrama he gets his daily rationing from.  
So perhaps it becomes incumbent upon researchers, that are independent with no strings attached, to lay out certain things - in measured words - that otherwise wouldn't come to the fore.  
To keep things simple, I start with the observation that the whole Yavana world never talks about the biggest genocide in the history of mankind - the genocide of Hindus.  
Taking a naturalistic view, it is always the complaint of the "lesser" that's taken up rather than of the "higher". E.g. in South Africa , hate crimes against whites are normalised and underreported.  
So, not attributing malice to anyone, it has to be then understood that Hindus will have to - willingly or unwillingly - take to the pedestal and find strength from within.  
Unfortunately this also means things such as explaining the Nazi phenomenon as if it were connected to Hinduism (as you know it's Hindus, not Germans, that are being asked the questions).  
Another misfortune is the burden of explaining (using psychoanalysis, p.i.e., you name it) the genocidal acts of Yavana-s unleashed upon natives of various continents.  
The aim of this writing isn't to suggest how this is to be done, it's to mind Hindu scholars what challenges lie ahead of them in contrast to their present indulging in 'tilting at the windmills'.  
The aim of this writing is to suggest the kind of tools that are at disposal, and the ways in which you may go wrong. And Yavana-s don't figure in this at all.  
The claim here isn't historical accuracy (for history is interpreted, anyway) but to the consistency of the narrative (across available facts).  
--------------------------------------  
The Core and the Crust

After the advent of Kaliyuga (3000 BCE), secular sects later known as Jainism and Buddhism (and atheists, too) took roots, became fashionable, and were able to position very high among power heirarchies.  
In response, Vedanta formed, as the crust of a Vedic polytheistic core, and succeeded in - first creating a capacity, an ability, to talk to secular sects under respectable terms - second, in gaining enough general respectability so as to be able to rise in power heirarchies.  
Kaliyuga, meanwhile, progressed, but the crust proved successful in interfacing with monotheistic vikAra-s mostly emanating from beyond.  
The crust grew thicker, sucking in Hindu elites and allied/affiliated/affected groups. Vedanta thus succeeded in building the grand narrative in the sub-continent, and more.  
--------------------------------------  
The Diplomat became The King

It was the genius in Adi Shankara who, coming from a place blessed with advanced awareness of world intrigues, foresaw the distant future and in one stroke seated the Diplomat firmly in King's throne.  
Vedanta, miraculously, then continued to prosper in urban centers- despite political upheavals- and not less importantly continued to provide a safety crust to multifarious indigenous sects of Hinduism- including the core.  
--------------------------------------  
The Legacy, the halAhala

Fittingly, the outboards of Aryavarta were the regions where innovations in the interface, in the form of Vedanta, came about.  
The curse came about eventually in the form of legacy. The descendants of Abhinavagupta, for example, becoming the torch bearers of stone-pelter guerrillas that we observe everywhere in the sub continent today, or the woke Hindu minority in Shankara's own land, and so on and forth.  
The Father is judged by the son, all the sophistry aside.  
--------------------------------------  
The Blinders

The crust was designed to keep certain blinders on intellectual freedom to see that not too many feathers were ruffled.  
In time it became sort of permanent. Learning, of any form, came to mean a passive subscription of the power narrative of the day.  
Research came about to mean looking away, rather than looking at. Vain degrees, awards and positions. Worthless lives.  
Hindus became the worst oppressors of Hindus. Brahmabandhus became the masters of Brahmana-s and the rest.
