Many thanks to Dr. Kannan, to Dr. Korada, to Dr. Isaacson, and to Dr. Sastry. You have all given me much to think about. My question about how the name talātala divides has been answered as tala + atala. This was made clear. This then led to the question of how to understand this compound. The options seem to be as a dvandva, along the lines of carācara, “the moving and the unmoving,” or as a pañcamī tatpuruṣa, with an unusual vigraha. Despite the unusual vigraha, the meaning given by Dr. Kannan makes good sense to me, as it did to Dr. Isaacson. Or as put by Dr. Sastry, “a deeper underworld far below the ground level.” Something along these lines seems to be what the *Śabdakalpadruma* was getting at, in its fuller statement: nāsti talaṃ yasyeti atalam \| talād api atalam \| atyanta-nimnatayāsya tathātvam. Other options are of course possible. I am always interested in meaning, but as a poetic expression, it may well be that the alliteration with the word tala in this whole list of seven is the main point.
