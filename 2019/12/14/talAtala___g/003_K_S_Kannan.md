Dear David Reigle,

I am not in a position to give any traditional/authentic explanation for the dissolution given.

I can only proffer a conjecture (and a wild one at that, perhaps!).

  

Nouns in Sanskrit are effectively no different from adjectives.  

Epithets often get "frozen" into Proper Nouns.

If tala is \[what is at\] bottom, the base,  

atala is a sort of a "bottomless" pit, a realm beyond and beneath the tala.

talAd apy atalam could or perhaps should then mean

the realm which is more netherlandish than the tala.  

  

So then, in this vigraha, tala is a Proper Noun,

while atala is an Adjective.

  

I look forward to more sensible explanations if any  

from knowledgeable scholars in this list.
