Dear Dr. Kannan ji,

  

Thank you very much for finding this for me. I did not even think of looking in the two great Sanskrit dictionaries. Please pardon my ignorance, but I am not familiar with the word api used in the vigraha of a compound. How would talAd api atalam be understood or translated? I can only guess at something like, "although from an underworld, not an underworld." Not sure that this would make sense, since talAtala is in fact one of the seven talas. Also, this would not seem to be any kind of compound that I am familiar with. Sorry for the further questions.

  

Thanks and best wishes,
