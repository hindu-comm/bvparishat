The explanation of talAd api atalam given by Dr. Kannan seems to me hardly like a wild conjecture, instead it seems natural and convincing. In general, one may say that we often see (not necessarily in compound analyses) the structure X-5th-case-ending api Y-1st-case-ending, with X a noun and Y an adjective, in the meaning 'more Y even than X'. For example: काकादपि कृष्णमिदं कपालम् 'This skull(-bowl) is blacker even then a crow!' (Mattavilāsaprahasana). We do not need a comparative form, although we also have cases with that, of course (प्राणेभ्योऽपि/प्राणादपि गरीयसी, पुत्रादपि प्रियतमः, and the like).
