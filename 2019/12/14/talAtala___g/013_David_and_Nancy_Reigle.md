Dear Vidvan Shashi ji,

  

In reply to: "If some one knows where in padma and agni purANa they are, please let me know."  

  

In the Agni-purana, the talas are given in chapter 120, verse 2, both the Venkatesvara edition and the Anandasrama edition.

  

In the Padma-purana, the talas are given in the seventh and last section or kriya-khanda, chapter 2, verses 12-13. This is in the Venkatesvara edition.

  

While writing, I wish to thank vidvans Kalicharan Tuvij, Bijoy Misra, and R. N. Iyengar for their replies giving additional information. I appreciate them.

  

Best regards,

  

David Reigle

Colorado, U.S.A.
