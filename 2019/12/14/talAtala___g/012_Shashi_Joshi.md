As per shabda-kalpa-druma, there are references in padma and agni purANa as well (see screenshots below), though I could not find them in the respective purANa-s themselves (from [archive.org](http://archive.org) PDFs)

If some one knows where in padma and agni purANa they are, please let me know or share a link/screenshot.

  

  

**padma-purANa :** atala, vitala, sutala, talAtala, mahAtala, rasAtala, pAtAla

**agni-purANa :**atala, sutala, vitala, gabhastimat, mahAtala, rasAtala, pAtAla  
  
**vAyu-purANa :** atala, sutala, vitala, gabhastala, mahAtala, shrItala, pAtAla  

  

So, talAtala does not seem to be in two of the listings!

  

Also, rasAtala is called shrItala in vAyu-purANa, not sure why.

  

  

In the SKD entry, the excerpts from padma and agni purANa also have a distance component mentioned - yojana-ayuta.
