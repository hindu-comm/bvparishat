Dear scholars,

Permit me to share a few thoughts on this thread.

The main question was about breaking the compound word that has been answered and David Reigle seems satisfied. But I have reservations about meanings extracted out of such equations. Vigraha vaakya, vyutpatti, nirvacana,.. helps, but grammar is not the umpire for meanings. This of course is well recognized as योगाद्रूढिर्बलीयसी \|\|

In Sanskrit texts on technical subjects the context is more important to arrive at the meaning than dissecting the s'abda. In the present context the seven 'tala' appear in the Vaayu and the Brahmanda puraNa and later repeated with variants in other texts. If we accept these as the oldest among the 18+ puranas, it is worthwhile to see what VaP and BrP have to say on the subject.

BrP: (I.ch 2O. )

It is seen that there is one to one correspondence except for a few names; talātala is one such. As per Br.P **tala** is below **talātala**.

The colours of the seven so called nether worlds are identical in the two texts. The physical picture given is that of layers of soil in a deep pit or mine shaft. The first is black-cotton soil,.....the sixth layer is hardrock and the seventh is perhaps the gold bearing layer. Of course one can also read a type of cosmography. All the same we need not forget the folk wisdom
