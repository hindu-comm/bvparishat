Dear Vidvāns,



As you know, seven talas are spoken of in some of the purāṇas. While there are a few variants in the names given for these, the listings usually include the talātala. My question is how does this name divide: Is it tala + atala, or tala + ātala, or talā + tala? I have not been able to find this in any commentary so far.



What may be taken as a standard listing of these seven talas was put by Sadānanda into his *Vedāntasāra*. They are there given, in khaṇḍa 16, as: atala, vitala, sutala, rasātala, talātala, mahātala, and pātāla. The commentaries by Nṛsiṃhasarasvatī (G. A. Jacob 1934 5th edition, p. 22) or by Rāmatīrtha (Jacob, p. 110) or by Apadeva (K. Sundararama Aiyar 1911 edition, p. 68) do not gloss them. The other one of the seven that may be in question, rasātala, is explained by V. R. Ramachandra Dikshitar in *The Purana Index*, vol. 3, p. 59, as “the underworld of rocky soil,” showing that he divided it as rasā + tala. He defines talātala simply as “an underworld,” (vol. 2, p. 12) so we do not know how he understood the compound.



The *Bhāgavata-purāṇa* at 5.24.7 (and also at 2.1.26-27, and 2.5.40-41) has these same seven. They are not glossed by Śrīdhara in his commentary on this purāṇa.



The *Āruṇi-upaniṣad* (among the Saṃnyāsa-upaniṣads) in its first paragraph also has these same seven. They are not glossed by Upaniṣad-brahmayogin in his commentary on this upaniṣad.



The *Viṣṇu-purāṇa* at 2.5.2 does not include talātala, but has instead these seven: atala, vitala, nitala, gabhastimat, mahā\[tala\], sutala, and pātāla.



I would be very glad to find an authoritative source on how the name talātala divides.



Thank you,
