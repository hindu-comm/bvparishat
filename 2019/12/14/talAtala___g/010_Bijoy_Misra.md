All words formed through the syllables are cognitive. The bundle has a meaning.

We don't yet know how the bundle forms, but its origin is in the neural system.

Grammar is an external tool to dissect what the brain creates. The syllable stress,

diction and the intensity are all connected in the origin of the word.
Eventually it

becomes a unit of sound to which various syllables offer different contributions.

We understand this broadly, but we need to understand neurologically.  

Thought to share this element in this discussion.

Thank you.
