Dear Professor Murthy,  
  
  
One small suggestion; for the न वसुधारसगोचरः word-division, rather than 'is not seen by the earth', something like 'did not become the object of the earth's desire (rasa)' would be a little more precise, and a little easier to understand, perhaps, by readers. Here the idea is that since the earth enjoys something spotless, the Lord's face, it thereafter became/becomes uninterested in enjoying something, the moon, which though somewhat similar, is stained/spotted. This is clarified by the poet's commentary, glossing rasa, in this word-division, with 'the wish to taste'; वसुधाया रसस्य आस्वादनेच्छाया गोचर आस्पदं नाभूत्. Here the focus is on the earth's perspective (it is of course a poetic fancy, उत्प्रेक्षा).  
  
With best regards,  
  
Harunaga Isaacson

  
  
  
  
  
  
“Lord! The earth feels contented after drinking your blemish-free moon-like face. Is it the reason, that the moon with its central part getting soiled by the blemish is not seen by the earth (has acquired the new ambrosia)?”
