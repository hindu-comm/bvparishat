My attempt at translation, for whatever it is worth:

  

"Drinking the blemishless face-moon of Yours, Oh Lord, the Earth gets to be gratified forever ;

for, is it consequently that the \[other\] Moon, whose interior is muddied by the blot  

ceased to be an object of relish for the Earth?

(*alternatively*: did that Moon thence become one who came to taste a new nectar?).

  

Others are welcome to improve upon this.
