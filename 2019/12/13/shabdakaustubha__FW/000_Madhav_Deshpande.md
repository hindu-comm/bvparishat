Dear Colleagues,

  

  With print copies and digital copies of various parts, I have Bhaṭṭoji Dīkṣita's Śabdakaustubha only upto the end of the 4th Adhyāya.
Was the remaining Śabdakaustubha ever published? And if so, does anyone have access to it? Perhaps, I should look for manuscripts of Śabdakaustubha for this remaining portion.
