Dear list,

  

Dharmashree and Avaranam were in the big parcel of Samskrita Bharati books that recently came into my possession thanks to the kind help of friends from BVP. Having been translated by Dr Hegde and Dr Vishvas respectively, the quality of language is excellent, and if you're looking for enjoyable reads from the SB range, consider getting at least these two - you won't be sorry.

Now I'd like to send copies of these novels to some of my friends who read neither Kannada nor Sanskrit. I managed to find an English translation of Avaranam, but not of Dharmashree. Does anybody know what translations of Dharmashree exist?

  

Thank you,

Irene
