Dear Deva Pattanayak Sir, I am posting 1 video of a Vaallabha Aacharya/Scholar of his Jeevatma Seminar.

He has explained the 4 levels of conciousness Michio Kaku recognizes, and then goes on explaining in detail how 9 levels have been imagined in our Shastras, through Vedas, Vishnu Purana, a shloka of Dandi and many ways he's explaining the nature of Jeevatma after explaining conciousness.  
It's a long series, but worth watching.
