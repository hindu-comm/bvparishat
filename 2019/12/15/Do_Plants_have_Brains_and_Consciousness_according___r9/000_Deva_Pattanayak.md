VEDIC REFERENCE TO CONSCIOUSNESS OF PLANTS  
  

  

I live in Cambridge, MA. It is winter now. I had sown some pepper seeds. They germinated but are staying at the stage of having only two leaves. It is lik ethey have decided that this is not the time to grow, it is winter, let us wait till spring which is not far away.

That and what I know of the work of Jagdish Bose on plants, I realized that these plants are conscious of the time and weather.

  

Then I googled and I found a lot of information on topics like

  

"Do plants have brains"

  

  

"

The deep intelligence possessed by plants has been explored and discussed by many people of note over the past several centuries, including Goethe, Luther Burbank, George Washington Carver, Masanobu Fukuoka, Jagadis Bose, and the Nobel Prize-winner Barbara McClintock. Plants, it turns out, really are[highly conscious](https://www.consciouslifestylemag.com/the-six-levels-of-higher-consciousness-how-to-make-the-shift/), intelligent and yes, they do have a brain. Itâ€™s just that no one ever looked in the right place.'

  

The reason of my posting this in BVP is to seek references to Vedic literature that supports that plants have Consciousness,

Please be very specific and do not inject your ideas and opinions unless you you have pramana.

  

Hope to hear from some of you.
