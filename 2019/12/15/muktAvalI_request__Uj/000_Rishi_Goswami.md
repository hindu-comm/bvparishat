I searched and stumbled upon this tika of Muktavali. Subodhini Tika it says.  
Where can I get the pdf if available?  
  
<http://sanskrit.uohyd.ac.in/Corpus/CIIL/Subodhini/subhodini-1-62.txt>  
  
  
Some parts mention the Arthaloka Tikakar Pattabhirama Shastriji. Has he also written a work on the Muktavali?  
  
Regards
