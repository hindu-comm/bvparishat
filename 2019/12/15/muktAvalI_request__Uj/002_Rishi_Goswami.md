Thank you very much Mahabhaga.  
Dhanyosmi.

I found a scanned copy.

Are there any other Tikas which I can buy/download? Please tell me. I have Rajivollasa (xerox), Dinkariya-Ramarudriya (Chokhamba) and now Subodhin (pdf).

If there are any other suggestions, it would be very helpful to refer if I don't understand through 1 Tika.

Namaskara  
Bhooyah Dhanyavadah \_/\\\_
