Namskar Irene-ji. Yes, Most probably that's the desired copy.

I think I have a pdf of Kiranavali by the same Tikakar, but the commentary is on Tarka Sangraha and TS Dipika. I couldn't find it online so I uploaded it to drive. Here's link. <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1b-eNMMzoteBjuzLZzK6u5KmnHB2-eGBP/view?usp=drivesdk>

He has written a commentary on NS Muktavali by the same name, as a Google seach "kiranavali kirhanavallabhacharya" gave me the same result. There's no Pdf available though. Just that a website may have enlisted this and it appeared as search.

Thanyou Irene-ji, it would be very helpful if we can have access to its scanned pdf.

Dhanyavadah
