Friends,

  

I came across the word दुष्टतानः in Valmki today.

I had seen it before, but not reflected.  

तान as a word is possibly very colloquial.

Through it is used in the music vocabulary it possibly

has a deeper connotation as "train of thought".

तान is not observed unless manifested in actin.  

When in action, it is too late to react!  

Sugriva wants Hanuman to check out the intention

of the brothers Rama and Lakshmana from their

appearance and their conduct. (4.2.27)  

Such kind of detection is very much needed in the modern

world.  

  

तान in sabdakalapdruma goes into myriads.

So is the detectibility of the human mind!

I don't know if their is any academic discussion on

the subject. The scholars may help.

  

Best regards,  

  

BM
