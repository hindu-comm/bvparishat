\> I hope someone can give a better explanation of दुष्टतानयो:?  
  

As you know, there is no better explanation, and there is no need for  
a better explanation, Madhav. It is also perfectly fitting in the  
narrower and wider context. Otherwise, Mr. Misra may be so kind as to  
explain on the one hand what the phantom word "duṣṭa-tāna" should mean  
here, and on the other hand how to construe the whole sentence with  
vijñeyā then (that is, without duṣṭatā, or aduṣṭatā). After all, we  
never stop learning.  
  
From my point of view, however, there is no reason to discuss this  
simple and perfectly clear verse any further.  
  
Best,  
RS
