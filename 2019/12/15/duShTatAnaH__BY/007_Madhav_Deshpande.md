The full verse reads:

  

śuddhātmānau yadi tvetau jānīhi tvaṃ plavaṅgama .  
vyābhāṣitairvā rūpairvā vijñeyā duṣṭatānayoḥ .. 26..

  

The first line contains the dual forms शुद्धात्मानौ एतौ, and the second line refers to this dual with the dual form अनयो:. Sugrīva says to Hanumān: "O Plavagama \[ref to Hanuman\], the evil character \[दुष्टता, or non-evil character अदुष्टता\] of these two \[Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa\] should be discovered by their words or forms." The entire chapter talks about the very first time Sugrīva sees Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa, and does not know who they are.
