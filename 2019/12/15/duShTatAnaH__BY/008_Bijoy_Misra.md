Madhavji,

You have to assess the context of Sugriva more.

You have to check why Sugriva is afraid of spies and disguised individuals.

The context starts in the book III.

दुष्टता is not established, it is only the scare in Sugriva's mind.  

There is a tendency to go local by using grammar than the story.

So is my opinion.

Best regards,

BM
