Dear colleagues

Very sorry. It is actually शाकपार्थिव।It was mistyped by me due to cold effect and I could not be careful in haste.Shishupalavadham begins with श्री and ends with श्री in every सर्ग whereas Kirat adhiniyam starts with श्री but ends with लक्ष्मी.

Hence both have been addressed as श्र्यङ्क

And लक्ष्म्यङ्क respectively.

Please excuse me for mistyping.

Regards

Girish K.Jha
