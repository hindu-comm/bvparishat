Respected Colleagues,

संहितैकपदे नित्या नित्या धातूपसर्गयोः।नित्या समासे वाक्ये तु सा विवक्षामपेक्षते।।Keeping in mind this traditional कारिका I would like to say that श्री in श्री आञ्जनेय isBound in this Compound word.श्री युतः आञ्जनेयः इति विग्रहे शाखपार्थिवादित्वात् समासेश्री आञ्जनेयःइति।Hence it must be combinedIn sandhi.I have seen many old Grammarians using श्र्यङ्कम् शिशुपालवधम् इति।As such श्र्याञ्जनेयम् might be साधु।But this type of usage I could not find in the literature.Also it appears श्रुतिकटु।If some scholars use without सन्धि I go unresponsive.Girish K.JhaSent from my Samsung Galaxy smartphone.

Except in a few cases, especially with names beginning with "i", the word śrī is left without sandhi. Particularly with ānandatīrtha, I see the usage of śrīmat, rather than śrī by itself.Madhav M.
