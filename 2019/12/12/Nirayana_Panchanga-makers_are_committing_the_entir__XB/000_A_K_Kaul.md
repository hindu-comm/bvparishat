Respected members of Bharatiya Vidvat Parishad,  

Jai Shri Ram!

"In continuing to follow the *nirayana* system, the Hindu calendar makers are under delusion that they are following the path of Dharma. They are actually committing the entire Hindu society to *Adharma*".
Attachment "nirayana adharma"

I have been pondering on these lines of the "Report of Saha Calendar Reform Committee"--page 260-- for quite some time as to what compelled that committee to make such a damaging statement about "Hindu calendar makers". And I am sorry to say that the "Committee" was cent per cent correct! How?

***Vedic and Vedanga Jyotisha months and years are seasonal i.e., tropical and not Lahiri or Ramana nirayana years!***

Let us start with the Vedas:

1\. *Atharvan Tripadavibhuti Mahanarayanopanishat* 3/1 has succinctly summarized the time frame of a year in the following words:

पञ्चदशदिनानि पक्षो भवति \|पक्ष द्वयं मासो भवति \| मास द्वयं ऋतुर्भवति \| अयनद्वयं वत्सरो भवति \|\|'

'A fortnight consists of fifteen days. Two fortnights comprise a month. Two months make a *ritu (*season). Two *ayanas (*Solstices) make a year."

2. There is a very categorical statement in *Shatapatha Brahmana* 3/7/1/8  

ऋतुभिर्हि संवत्सरः शक्नोति स्थातुं

''A year can exist/subsist only by dint of seasons"--

3\. The same *Shatapatha Brahmana* 2/1/3/3-4 says

वसन्तो ग्रीष्मो वर्षाः\|\| ते देवा ऋतवः शरद्धेमन्तः शिशिरस्ते पितरो ....स यत्रोदड.ावर्तते देवेषु तर्हि भवति देवान्स्तर्ह्यभिगोपायत्यथ यत्र दक्षिणावर्तते पितृषु तर्हि भवति पित्रीन्स्तर्ह्यभिगोपायति \|\|

स यत्रोदड.ावर्तते तर्ह्यग्नी आदधीतापह्तपाप्मानो देवा अप पापमानं ह ते अमृतादेवा नामृतत्वस्याशस्ति सर्वमायुरेति यस्तर्ह्याधते अथ यत्र दक्षिणावर्तते यस्तर्ह्याधत्ते अनपहत पाप्मानः पितरो न पाप्मानमपहते मर्त्याः पितरः पुरा ह्यायुषो म्रियते यस्तर्ह्याधत्ते \|\|  

As per the commentary of Acharya Sayana on the above mantras, the seasons of Vasanta, Greeshma and Varsha are the seasons of gods.
Sharat, Hemanta and Shishira are the seasons of Pitris (manes). The sun is visible to gods during the six months of Uttarayana whereas during the six months of Dakshinayana he is visible to "Pitris" i.e manes. As such, by starting sacrificial *agnis* during that period, i.e. *Uttarayana,* one is rid of sins and lives up to a ripe old age. But if one starts sacrificial fires in *Dakshinayana*, there is no possibility of the ''*hota*" being rid of sins and he may not live up to a ripe old age either.

4.*Aitrerya Brahman* 1/1/18/2 has said  

सप्तदशो वै प्रजापतिः \| द्वादश मासाः पञ्चर्तवः \|\| हेमन्तशिशिरयोः समासेन \| तावान् संवत्सरः\| संवत्सरः प्रजापतिः \|\| षड् वा ऋतव ऋतुश एव तत् संवत्सरमाप्नुवन्ति\|\|ऋतुशः संवत्सरे प्रतितिष्ठन्तो यान्ते \|\| द्वादश वै मासा मासश एव तत्संवत्सरमाप्नुवन्ति मासशः संवत्सरे प्रतितिष्ठन्तो यान्ति \|\|

''*Prajapat*i(the Creator) ---year--- has seventeen limbs. (These are) twelve months and five seasons, by clubbing together the seasons of *Hemanta* and *Shishira.* That is what a*Samvatsarah* is.
*Samvatsarah* is *Prajapatih.* There are six seasons (in a year). It is through seasons that a year is attained. A year has twelve months.
It is through these very months that a year is attained"

5. Maitraayani Upanishad 6/14   

सूर्यो योनिः कालस्य तस्यैतद्रुपं यन्निमेषादिकालात्संभृतं द्वादशात्मकम् वत्सरमेतस्याग्नेयमर्धम् वारुणम् \| मघाद्यं श्रविष्ठार्धमाग्नेयं क्र्मेणोत्क्रमेण सार्पाद्यं श्रविष्ठार्धान्तम् सौम्यं \| तत्रैकैकमात्मनो नवांशकं सचारकविधं सौक्ष्म्यत्वादेतत्प्रमाणमनेनैव
प्रमीयते हि कालः\|

"The sun is the originator of time. The following are its forms: from a *nimesha* to a year of twelve months. Its one half (Ayana) is of Agni and the other half (Ayana) is of Varuna. From *Magha* to *Shravistha*, the half-year (i.e. one Ayana) is of Agni and the other half from *Ashlesha* to *Dhanishtha* (viz. Dakshinayana) is of Varuna in .......that is how time is measured"

***A year has 12 months, six seasons and two ayanas***

 मधुश्च माधवश्च वासन्तिकावृतू शुक्रश्च शुचिश्च ग्रैष्मावृतू नभश्च नभस्यश्च वार्षिकावृतू इषश्चोर्जश्च शारदावृतू सहश्च सहस्यश्च
हैमन्तिकावृतू तपश्च तपस्यश्च शैशिरावृतू \|\| तै. सं. 4.4.11***  
***

Madhu and Madhava are the months of Vasanta Ritu, Shukrah and Shuchih are the months of Greeshma Ritu, Nabhas and Nabhasya are the months of Varsha Ritu, Isha and Urja are the months of Sharad Ritu, Sahah and Sahasya the months of Sharad Ritu and Tapas and Tapasya the months of Shishira Ritu.

***Sacrificial offers were made to these very Madhu, Madhava etc. solar as well as lunar months***

मधवे स्वाहा माधवाय स्वाहा शुक्राय स्वाहा शुचये स्वाहा नभसे स्वाहा नभस्याय स्वाहेषाय स्वाहोर्जाय स्वाहा सहसे स्वाहा सहस्याय स्वाहा तपसे स्वाहा तपस्याय स्वाहांहस्पतये स्वाहा\|\| वा. सं. 22.31  

As per the above mantras, offerings are made to Madhu, Madhava etc. months

Though in the Vedic lore, the names Madhu, Madhava etc. are usually supposed to be the seasonal solar months, but they have been used as names for seasonal lunar months also as is evident from the above quote of Vajasneya Samhita, where an Adhika lunar month has been clubbed as *Amhaspatih* with the twelve Madhu, Madhava etc. months.

***Vedanga Jyotisham corroborates the Vaidik dictum of seasonal months and years:***

All these Vaidik mantras reflect what the ancient most available indigenous calendrical astronomical work of 15th century BCE, viz. the Vedanga Jyotisha has said in both of its versions in the very first/second mantra

पञ्चसंवत्सरमयं युगाद्यक्षं प्रजापतिम् \| दिनर्त्वयनमासाङ्गम् प्रणम्य शिरसा शुचिः \|\|

"Purifying myself and saluting with bent head to Prajapati, the embodiment and presider over the five year yuga and who has for his limbs time-segments like the day, month, seasons and the course of sun (Ayanas)" K V Sarma translation.

***A new Vedic solar year started with Uttarayana:***

स्वराक्रमेते सोमार्कौ यदा साकं सवासवौ \| स्यात् तदादि युगं माघस्तपः शुक्लो अयनं ह्युदक् \|5\|

प्रपद्येते श्रविष्ठादौ सूर्याचन्द्रमसाउदक् \| सार्पार्धे दक्षिणार्कस्तु
माघ श्रावणयोः सदा \|\|6\|\|

"When the sun and the moon while moving in the sky, come to Vasava (Dhanishtha, Beta-Delphini) star together, then the Yuga, the Magha (month), the *Tapas* (season), the light half of the month, and the winter solstice, all commence together.

"The sun and the moon turn towards North in the beginning of *Dhanishtha* and towards South in the middle of *Ashlesha*. The sun always does this respectively in the months of Magha and Shravana".--S B Dikshit's translation

Thus it is clear from all the above clarifications that the Uttarayana Day viz. the Winter Solstice---the shortest day of the year--- is a very sacred day as per all the Vedas and the VJ.

Similarly, it also proves that all the Vedas and the Vedangas talk of a seasonal i.e. a Tropical solar year comprising 12 solar/lunar months as
Madhu/Chaitra etc., six ritus like Vasanta, Greeshma etc. and two ayanas viz. the two Solstices i.e. Uttarayana and Dakshinayana!

***Makar and other Samkrantis are conspicuous by their absence from the Vedas and the VJ:***

We have seen from the above analysis that there are no Mesha, Vrisha etc. Rashis in the Vedas or the Vedangas!

I am also sure that quite a few members of this august forum must have studied all the four Vedas and even the Vedangas. I am equally sure that none of those scholars has either come across any *Samkranti* including the well known Makar Samkranti in any of the Vedas or the Vedangas!

We shall discuss in the subsequent mail the genesis of Makar etc. Samkrantis in India as to how Uttarayana became seasonal Makar Samkranti and as to how it degenerated into the farce of the present Lahiri Makar Samkranti!

But in the meantime, we have to bear in mindthat the real Makar Samkranti-cum-Pongal-cum-Shishira Samkranti-cum-Uttarayanais on Sunday, December 22, 2019---the exact "ingress" being about 9-51 am IST---and not on January 15, 2020 which is is nothing but *niraddhar*!

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!
