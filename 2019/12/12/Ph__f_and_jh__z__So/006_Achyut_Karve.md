Dear Misraji,

  

"I would request all not to hang on to how

anything sounds, but try to reflect and analyze how a sound originates.

The differences in voices or in geography are peripheral. What is interesting

is the cognitive information content of a sound.derived from inside the brain."

  

Yes the question is not how sounds are heard but how it is produced.
But at the sametime one cannot overlook the fact that humans learn to speak by listening. Listening prompts a child to speak. The question therefore to be asked is how the human brain interprets a sound to reproduce it. But this too is not so simple. Humans do not reproduce sounds as individual units but as a sequence of sounds called words or sentences. Had it been not been so the evolution of writing would not have taken so long in human history.

  

In short language is not purely muscular though the final outcome is through it. Phonation of words is the outcome of coordination of many aspects. It is doubtful whether a purely neurological or acoustic approach will solve the enigma of language.

  

Finally we cannot forget that communication in living things takes place alongwith the evolution of the species itself. Language has a history of evolution but not in isolation from his evolution as a species.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
