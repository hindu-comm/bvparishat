In Telugu for cha, ja - dantya for pure native words when they have the vowels a, aa, u, oo, o, O, au; tAlavya in other cases. For Sanskrit or tatsama words always tAlavya.

  

The tAlavya to dantya change occurredprobably during the poet tikkana's period (13th century) as there are SAsanas where the dantya cha was sculpted as tsa.

  

In fact, I am nowadays propagating the idea of why we should not have vaDi (axarasAmya yati) in Chandassu for dantya cha and ja with ta varga letters.
