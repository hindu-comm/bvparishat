Dear Achyutji,

While I have to respect your thoughts, I must say that you make them up on an observational

speculative level. As I have written earlier, we need to be more analytic than base our thoughts  

on correlations. It is not easy. But all superficial correlations must be rejected. Just think with

contemplation, you may find why there is a difference between hearing and speaking.

Best regards,

BM
