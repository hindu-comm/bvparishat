I find that the pronunciation of Indic ‘ph’ (फ) is becoming ‘f’ (फ़) among many city dwellers and the so-called elite. Phala (फल =fruit, result), kapha (phlegm) saphala (successful), Praphulla (blooming), etc., are pronounced fala, kafa, safala, Prafulla etc \[the implicit word final ‘a’ might not get pronounced in north Indian languages but is shown in the English transliteration for the sake of completeness.) The unsophisticated villager pronounces the pha correctly.

  

In Maharashtra and Gujarat, the Indic ‘jh’ (झ, ઝ) has changed to ‘z’ (ज़) in the pronunciation of the city dweller, the elite, and the sophisticated. 

I think both the above changes (ph \> f, and jh \> z) are not natural changes, but some sort of elite emulation with the elite trying to copy Urdu/Persian and English pronunciations. However, a person who knows Urdu well will not confuse ph and f, and jh and z. The unsophisticated villager too pronounces these correctly. 

  

The change of ‘c’ (च) to some kind of ‘tsa’ in Marathi seems to be a natural evolution rather than any elite emulation. On a lighter note, when travelling by train from Kerala to North India, I could quite correctly mark when the train crossed the Karnataka – Maharashtra border by the chai-wallah’s call. Till the Karnatka – Maharashtra border, the chai wallahs of the railway station call cāya – cāya – cāya, and once the train has crossed into Maharashtra, the call becomes tsāy – tsāy – tsāy.



In Telugu, there seems to be some j-z confusion with many Telugus pronouncing bonafide Indic ‘j’ (as in “Vijaya”) as ‘z’.

  

Interestingly, in the Marathi song “mājhā sāraṅgā …”, Lata Mangeshkar seems to pronounce mājhā (=my) neither as mājhā, nor as māzā but as mājā probably to rhyme well with rājā.
