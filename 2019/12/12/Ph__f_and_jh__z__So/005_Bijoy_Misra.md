Phonation is a muscle effect, it has little to do with cognition or expression.

it is local and we train our muscles as we wish to imitate. The same expression

can sound different in different parts of the world and can be uttered differently.

What matters, I would think, is the neurology behind the generation of the sound.

This investigation is difficult. I would request all not to hang on to how

anything sounds, but try to reflect and analyze how a sound originates.

The differences in voices or in geography are peripheral. What is interesting

is the cognitive information content of a sound.derived from inside the brain.
