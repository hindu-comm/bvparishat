Learning language, including the varieties of pronunciation unique to each language, is a very complex affair. Children learn it very easily and naturally though. Till age 9, my family was in Delhi. I had my early primary education in Hindi in Delhi. I don't remember when I learnt to speak in Hindi. It somehow naturally came to me and I was speaking fluent Hindi at school and with friends, and fluent Malayalam at home, each language with its own peculiarities of pronunciation.
Then, when I was 9 years old, my father got transfer back to home state and we all returned to Kerala. I continued my education in Malayalam.
This was an effortless transition for me. Over the years, I forgot much of the Hindi that I learned naturally in my childhood and boyhood. But I still retain the correct accent and pronunciation, so nobody can catch me as a non-Hindi speaker based on my pronunciation. But they will definitely catch me based on the grammatical mistakes I make mostly on the streelinga and pullinga of inanimate objects.

  

My older grandson, who is three years old now, used to speak four languages a year ago when he was just two years old - his father's language Malayalam, his mother's language Kannada, and the French and English he heard at the daycare in Montreal. He still speaks three languages - Malayalam, Kannada and English. Forgot French as his parents relocated from Montreal to eastern Canada where French is not the majority language. The following shows how he adapts naturally to the peculiarities of pronunciation of each language. When he says "soil" to his mother (as in "I want to play in soil") he says it as maṇṇu; but he modifies the regular hrasvaukāraṃ at the end of the word tosaṃvṛta ukāraṃ (very short u) and makes it Malayalam maṇṇŭ when telling his father the same thing.
