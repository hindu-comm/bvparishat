Dear Misraji,

  

If you think that my observations are superfluous just because I do not submit experimental proof you are grossly mistaken.

  

Here is an example. One of my friends brought a digital tabla tuning machine to tune the tabla. I asked my friend to tune the tabla according to his machine when we played the drone and percussed the tabla we found that it was not tuned. You try to tune a tanpura and you for yourself will experience how difficult it is to tune one. Machines are no match for human skills provided the individual has a skilled sense. That is what Shiksha is about.

  

Branded tea is tested for flavour by men and not machines. We need not underestimate our sense perceptions. Sufficient effort needs to be put into their development. There is a lot of difference between the ear of an artist and that of a common ear.

  

Our ancients had skilled ears which were responsible for the evolution of such a language as Sanskrit. The popularization of machines/instruments has pauperized our sense perceptions.

  

I have put in a long 30 years just to figure out what is so natural to some artists which is unachievable to their students. The product of this long drawn search I have placed before you in the form of the Barakhadi Sutras. However this would not have been possible had it not been for the Maheshwar Sutras.

  

Continuously expecting answers from ancient literature is what we are given to. I think it is high time that we take the works of our ancients forward without messing everything with modern scientific methods.

  

I am from social sciences. Be sure that its study as well as methodology is much different from physical sciences. Physical sciences only give a single step answer to a why question. Why does an apple fall down from an apple tree? Gravity. Why is there gravity? And there is no answer. These are the limitations of physical sciences.
One will do great disservice to humanity by bringing every subject under the purview of physical sciences.

  

I would be very much interested to know from you what you mean by a scientific method and how it can be applied to social sciences.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
