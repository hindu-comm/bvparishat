Dear Misraji,

  

"Speech has to be generated, there is nothing like reproduction."

  

Man does not generate anything new and least of all an individual. What he generates not only depends upon what has been afforded to him by nature but also to a great extent on the efforts of the past generations. An individual at his best can only drop a drop of water in this huge ocean of humanity. But even if he has to achieve this, apart from knowing the tradition one also needs to have that bit of that common sense which till date has guided human kind into all the progress he has made. Instruments, technologies and science (experimental) can at the best make life temporarily soothing. By seeing through a microscope or a telescope man does not even pierce skin deep into the life process that are constantly at play in nature. They still remain conjectures. Conjectures which by a part of humanity has been termed science which in the past few centuries has been overturned by the succeeding generations by new conjectures. Science can at the best reveal a part of the reality.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
