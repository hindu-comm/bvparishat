Dear Vidwans,

  

All this discussion gives an impression that the same letter can be phonated at many places in the oral cavity.

  

This is what Patanjali says in his Pashpanhik. There are many words which convey similar meaning. The point is which of them follow dharma (are natural to man) and which do not. The same is true vis-a-vis letters.

  

The point is what are the points of phonation of letters from the point of view of Sanskrit. (i.e. from the point of view of dharma as enshrined in the Maheshwar Sutras). This was the reason why a student was examined for recitation by a panel consisting of pandits from across India centuries ago so that there would be uniformity in the place of phonation and the effort in the recitation across India.

  

When this practice could not be continued differences in both place of phonation as well effort must have started occuring resulting in the evolution of various styles of recitation. This evolution of various styles occurred because of the influence of local languages on vedic recitation which were not corrected through shiksha at the ab initio stage.

  

The next point is who corrupts whom? Do the vowels corrupt the consonants or do the consonants corrupt the vowels? It is necessary to answer the above question. Though we see that the consonants in different languages are voiced at different places the reason for this is the incorrect way of voicing the vowels. Thus we see a variety of ways in the voicing of vowels अ आ इ ई उ ऊ ए ऐ ओ औ of the script across India. This itself shows that vowels can be voiced with many a different effort depending on the language which one speaks. It is this difference in effort while voicing the vowels that results in the corruption of consonants apparently giving rise to a belief that a particular consonant in a particular language is different from that of another language.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
