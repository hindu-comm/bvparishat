The dual pronunciations of च, झ, ज, झ in Marathi are not due to elite influence of English, but integral to the language probably going back centuries. Typically, before इ/ई, and य, त, these sounds have a palatal pronunciation, while before other vowels, they have alveolar pronunciation. In most cases, in words directly derived from Sanskrit, like चंद्र, the palatal pronunciation is retained, but in Prakritized words like चांदोबा, you hear the alveolar pronunciation. In the song that Lata Mangeshkar is singing, the Marathi writing will reflect माझ्या सारंगा, and hence the palatal pronunciation of झ. On the other hand, झ in माझा भाऊ "my brother," you will hear the alveolar pronunciation. The "f"like pronunciation in words like फळ is more recent, and most likely the influence of English. English words like "bat" and "ball" are written in Marathi with improvised vowel signs: बॅट/बॉल, or "bank" is written as बॅंक. These signs are now part of official Marathi orthography.
