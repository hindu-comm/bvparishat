Dear list,

  

At some point there was a post on Devanagari fonts, and one of them looked particularly attractive. However, I can't find this post using any of the keywords that came to mind so far. Maybe I'm wrong, and the post wasn't here.

If you know which post I'm talking about, please post the link. If the post wasn't here, please consider this a query about an attractive looking Devanagari font. People who will be using it are almost 100% Windows users and would have MS Word or LibreOffice installed. These are innocent citizens, so please let's not go into LaTeX matters.

  

Thank you,

Irene
