Yes, even I got to know of a place of that name Srungarapuram in AP but no information about Sharada temple there. There is one place of the same name in Karnataka too: Kudremukh given that name just for the beauty of the landscapes there. Another place just on the outskirts of
Bangalore but no Sharada temple of fame known there.

  

If anyone has done research on Daasa saahitya with reference to this song and given any evidence of this place/temple/occasion when this was composed, that may help in this quest.

  

warm regards
