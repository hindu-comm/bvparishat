Yes, apart from the usual meaning 'erotic',Monier Williams also gives "शृङ्गार mfn. handsome, pretty, dainty, fine".

Owing to the natural beauty of the place, Purandara might have referred to शृङ्गेरी as शृङ्गार पुरin adjective sense rather than innoun sense. Eventoday, Sringeri Panchayat is doing a great job inkeeping the town clean and neat, much better than most of the metros and corporations in our country.

  

PS: Pandit Ganapati Bhat Hasanagi while rendering this पुरन्दरदास पद(<https://youtu.be/014HBhm6S1o>)usesशृङ्गेरी instead of शृङ्गार पुर\|
