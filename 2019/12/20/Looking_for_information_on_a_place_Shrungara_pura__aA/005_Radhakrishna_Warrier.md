It might be that the etymology of śṛṅga (शृङ्ग) and śṛṅgāra (शृङ्गार) are the same, but both mean very different things: śṛṅga is used in the sense of a peak (as of a mountain) or the horn of an animal (from which sīṃg सींग of Hindi and other Indo-Aryan languages might be derived) while śṛṅgāra is erotic feeling. I believe the name of the place śṛṅgēri (शृङ्गेरि) is associated with the name of a mountain peak and not the erotic sentiment. So, wonder why śṛṅgēri would be called śṛṅgārapura (शृङ्गारपुर).
