Subject: {भारतीयविद्वत्परिषत्} Sahitya Academy Award for Sanskrit

  

Respected Members,

Sri. Penna Madhusudan has won the coveted Sahitya Academy Award for Sanskrit. As a lover of Sanskrit, I heartily congratulate him.

Betraying my abysmal ignorance I seek more information on the author and his works.

Thanks and regards,

Murthy
