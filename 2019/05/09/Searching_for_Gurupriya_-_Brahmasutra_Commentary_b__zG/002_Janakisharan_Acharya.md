Thank you very much Shri M V S Siva Prasad ji for sharing this information.

  

But unfortunately at present I don't have any contact or friend who is in Kachipuram Mutt. So I can get it. If anybody can send me this book via. post or courier, I can transfer the money through Electronic Transfer.

  

Once I read that this book is published from Varanasi (I think, Shankaracharya Mutt, Hanuman Ghat, Varanasi). Next week I am going to Varanasi and I will try there also.

  

Regards

  

Dr. Janakisharan Acharya
