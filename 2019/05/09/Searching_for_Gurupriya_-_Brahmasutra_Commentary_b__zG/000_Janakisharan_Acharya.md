Respected VidwajjanH

  

I am searching digital copy of "**Gurupriya**" a Brahma Sutra Commentary written by Swami Sri Jayendra Saraswati Swami. While studying in Sringeri, I read it in Matha's Library. I I searched for it print version but not found.

  

If anybody share PDF, any link, it would help me for my work.
