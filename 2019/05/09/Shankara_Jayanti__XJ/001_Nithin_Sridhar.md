Namaste everyone,

  
My article for Shankara Jayanthi- <http://www.indictoday.com/thoughts/the-garland-of-knowledge-a-glimpse-into-brahmajnanavalimala-of-adi-shankaracharya/>

  

It is a short English commentary on the opening verse of the wonderful text of Brahmajnanavalimala of Adi Shankaracharya.  
  
Regards,  
Nithin S
