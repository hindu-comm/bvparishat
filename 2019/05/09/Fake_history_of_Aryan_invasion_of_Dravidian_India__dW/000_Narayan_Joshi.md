Dear Shree Megh Kalyanasundaram, Namaste!

I read you your paper on "Aryan- and India".It is very detailed work. Congratulations.

The purpose of creating the fake theory of "Aryan Invasion of Dravidian India" is to hide the real ancient history of Europe. There was Mahabharat Empire spread over some part of the ancient Europe. Chines excavated Stree Rajya (Ladies kingdom) mentioned in Mahabharat in the Synkyang province of China. Lithuanian language is close to Sanskeit and Lithuanian river names are Indian river names. The ancient names of Croatia was H'Rat (Harahati-Sarasvti). I have a lot of information on this subject. Regards. N.R.joshi
