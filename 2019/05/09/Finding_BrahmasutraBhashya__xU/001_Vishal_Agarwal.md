#2 is lost but can be reconstructed from Sudarshana Suri's Shrutaprakashika. At the end of each Adhikarana, Shri Sudarshana Suri reviews three older interpretations, which are always in this order: Shankara, Bhaskara, Yadavaprakasha. From this, we can reconstruct Yadavaprakasha's commentary on the Brahmasutras but the work itself is lost.

  

No Hindi translation exists of the other three (I am not aware of any edition of #4 for that matter) to my knowledge, although an English translation of #3 is available.

  

A critical edition of chapters 1-2 on #1 below by Klaus Ruping is available, and a 'Diplomatic Edition' (based on Buitenen's unfinished edition of the entire work) of chapters 3-4 is also available. I have an eCopy of both.

  

Regards,
