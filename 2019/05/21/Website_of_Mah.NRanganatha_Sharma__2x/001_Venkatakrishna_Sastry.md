Namaste

  

1. Thanks to the family of Vidwan Ranganatha Sharma for putting up this wonderful useful scholarly resource.

A superficial visit to the site , where home page is in Kannada script should not make scholars to shy away from exploring this site for the Samskruth writings of Sharma ji.

  

2. **I draw the attention of scholars, specific ally to the Samskruth work :Samskrutham Naama Daivee Vak ( accessible at** <https://vidwannrs.in/public/pdf/099.pdf#page=5> ). **This is an important writing, where Sharma ji where one can see the rebuttal of western colonial views on ' Samskruth language, PIE argument, Samskruth as a derivaed language of Tamil, and many such specifics.**

**This article needs a proper English translation and global debate across all Sanskrit study circles to voice the position of tradition on ' Paninian Linguistics as Vedanga Vyakarana'.**   
'

  

3. Other important points in the article cover : The much debated 'svara' issue of vedas, the origin of vedas according to traditional
schools and the superiority of this view over many modern interpretations and views popular among indologists ,orientalists and colonials ! Sharma ji's writings did not get the attention of scholars as much as they deserve for three main reasons :

 (I) shy, self- effacingand reserved nature of traditional teacher at Sanskrit college ( and not in a University)

 (ii) Writing itself is in Samskruth and not in English ! ( Not that Sharma ji did not have proficiency in English! He was very good in English and

 many other languages of India)

 ( iii) The A ' Brahmin, not wearing the coat tie and shoes (!) and not having the title ' Ph.D' (!?)

  

Look forward for scholars to give their time and attention to this writing of Sharma ji.

  

With Regards

from a student who learned humbly the basics at the feet of Sharma ji)
