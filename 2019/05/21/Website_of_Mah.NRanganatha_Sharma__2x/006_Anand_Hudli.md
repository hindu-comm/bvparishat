Sir,

  

Thank you for sharing a wealth of information about Mahamahopadhyaya Ranganatha Sharma, including e-books. This website will surely be a source of vast knowledge on a variety of subjects.

  

A suggestion. Would it be possible to list the Sanskrit works in a separate section on the website, for the benefit of those who cannot read Kannada? I happen to be able to read both Kannada and Sanskrit but others may not.

  

Anand
