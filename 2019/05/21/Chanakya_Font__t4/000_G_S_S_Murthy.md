Respected Scholars,

As Chanakya Font is a popular font, well established among devanagari publishing industry, one needs to convert Unicode to Chanakya for sending any writing to publishers. There are some websites which offer to do this conversion. But I find that the Chanakya output turns out to be some gibberish. I installed Chanakya fonts on my PC but it looks like there is a compatibility problem. Obviously my knowledge is meagre in this area and I would be grateful for any guidance in this matter.

Thanks and regards,

GSS Murthy
