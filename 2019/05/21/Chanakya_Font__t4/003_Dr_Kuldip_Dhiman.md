Murthy Mahodaya,

  

I have had lots of problems with Devanagari fonts. Most of these fonts cannot be used on the net, email etc.

  

I would suggest you buy fonts from 4C plus company. They charge you about Rs 5 thousand and give you about 60 fonts which can be used anywhere. You may contact

  

Mr Mahesh 09953223733

  

Invest this money, you will never have any problems later.
