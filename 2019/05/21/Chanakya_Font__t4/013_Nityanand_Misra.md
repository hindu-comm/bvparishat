Dear Prof Bijoy Mishra Ji

  

Two things

  

1\) The file provided has only one TTF, which is supposedly the original Chanakya font (a Hindi font with one weight only), very different from Chanakya Sanskrit or Chanakya BBT (Sanskrit fonts, with four weights: normal, italic, boldface, and bold italic)

  

2\) Even the original Chanakya font, to the best of my information, is not free. The Chanakya fonts are extremely popular and are used by many newspapers and publishers (including Gita Press). But they are not free.

  

So most likely India Typing is not authorized to distribute the font file for free use.

  

Thanks, Nityananda Misra
