For those who may not be aware, please do check out <https://fonts.google.com/>

  

It has a lot of fonts, all/most free. You may even find free fonts that match professional ones as close as 90 to 98%, which means you can use them for your websites as well, or for personal use. And don't need to pay for the professional fonts.

  

It has many Unicode devanagari fonts as well, that have varying amount of ligatures.<https://fonts.google.com/?subset=devanagari>

  

There are many fonts that are similar to Kruti fonts as well, and also Sanskrit99

  

Vesper Libre is one such font.  
  

  
Thanks,  
Shashi
