Namaste

  

1. Annapurna SIL includes full support for Unicode 7.0 Devanagari ranges, including Indic numerals and currency symbols.

 (<https://software.sil.org/annapurna/support/faq/>) -
Annapurna fonts may be downloaded free from link: <https://software.sil.org/annapurna/>

 The usage depends upon the installation of graphite resources.

  

 The challenges of 'Proper representation of Samskruth as a Language proper, with its full needs met' are difficult to meet in the
font line of solutions . Some of these challenges have been listed at link : <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Components_for_Unicode>.

  
 Earlier Senior researchers did address and provided partial solutions (-Omkarananda, Maharshi Mahesh Yogi Team, CDAC, Sri Lipi and many others and many Indian researchers and institutions).There seems to be no final, viable, cost effective, deployed India wide, indigenous solution on hand till date. It seemsthat the problems are not in the 'branches' ( like the font, rendering) , but are rooted deeper ! The ' open source Free Linux line also has equally deeper problems).

  
 This issue calls for ab initio addressing the basic questions :

  

 (a) 'How is current Devanagari script display anchored research best suited to achieve therequirements of 'Samskrutham as a Programming Language for Computers ? Using regulations of Paninian rule base' ?

 Pl. Remember current roman alphabet script in current computing standards are not fully accommodating / supporting the full right use of all the IPA symbols, diacritics, or accent markers even for roman script languages. What to say of non-roman script brahmi langauge families? OCR approach may address 'Search a Text' but will it help voice - grammar process issues ? 

  

 (b) Is the statement 'Sanskrit is best suited for Computers (since 1984 ?!) limited to drive research- investments to develop Unicodecompliant fonts for devanagari script? Is it enoughto claim successinSanskrit computational Linguistics?

  
 The discussion on these points may be made with me in off
line mode as it involves deeper issues and investment - priorities with a vision for safeguarding the future of 'Sanskrit in Digital devices'. It is alsoanswering the question : ' Who should really, rightfully,ultimately holds control on Samskrutham' ? Government, Private agencies, Communities, Corporate, Ashram and Mathas ? Who ??

 Would attachment to pride of language drive investment support for research and technology implementation or luxury of working with freebies will comfort ? Answers to these points will decide the future options in this engagement.

  

 The subhashitakaara explained this paradigm ( mind settowards Samskruth) as the interest in a full grown mature tree(samskrutham)
for a gardener ( Water the tree to get fruit and grow a garden) , carpenter ( Cut the tree to make furniture) and a fuel seller ( uproot and chop the tree to get fuel for burning).
