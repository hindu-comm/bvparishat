Thank you Nityanandji for this valuable piece of information. I went to SummitIndia website, but I could not locate anything specific to Chanakya Font.

I would love not to buy any software if a "for free" option is available. I located a website

![image.png](https://groups.google.com/group/bvparishat/attach/2350433e2d8b0/image.png?part=0.1&view=1)  

If I input Unicode text (HTML option) it does give devanagari text in the output window, but there is no marked difference between unicode input and "Chanakya" output. When I paste it back to a word file, the font window shows it as Mangal only. I wonder if the web-app has really converted input Unicode(Mangal) to Chanakya. I am just reporting my observation so that I could be further guided.

Thanks and Regards,

Murthy
