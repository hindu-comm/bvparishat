I would like to know if Summit India has released Chanakya BBT fonts for free use. If no, then whether permission has been taken from Summit Indiato release the font files to public.

  

In 2015 and 2016, I had bought the Chanakya Sanskrit font from Summit India. This font which was slightly different from the Chanakya BBT font developed for the Bhaktivedanta Book Trust. From my interactions with Divyendu Gupta and Shyam Sunder at Summit India then, I had learned that both fonts were not free for public. When I bought Chanakya Sanskrit (and not Chanakya BBT), I signed an agreement with Summit India which clearly said that the font files cannot be shared with public. Things may have changed now, as this was the case three years ago.

  

Why do I take pains to write this email? There is an unbelievable amount of hard work involved in typeface design for Sanskrit (with hundreds of glyphs for conjunct consonants). I learned this the hard way as I tried (and failed) to design a Sanskrit font twice based on the Nirnay Sagar Press typeface. The first time I tried doing everything myself (with Inkscape, GIMP, FontForge, and Python) and the second time I tried this with a design firm, Three Dot Designs. After many months of intense hard work, the attempts were aborted. I had underestimated the amount of design and technology work that goes in designing fonts. Therefore, I feel it is only fair that firms like Summit India copyright their Sanskrit fonts and we as students/authors of Sanskrit respect their copyright.

  

If the Chanakya BBT font has been made free and authorized for public release by Summit India, I would be very happy person. But if it is not the case, I request you to please not share the font files publicly. Just as my publisher would not like PDFs of my books to be shared publicly (and may even sue people for doing so), font design firms will certainly not like unauthorized sharing of font files.

  

Thanks, Nityananda Misra
