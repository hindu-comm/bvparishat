Namaste  

  

I participated in the talk. The core part of the program was Prof. Korada Mahodaya's talk introducing the Vidyasthanas.  

  

Shri Megh Kalyanasundram beautifully presented the context for the
talk. He stated that If in the current era USA is the leading country where students flock for higher education, India was a pioneer in the field with some 12,000 students studying in Nalanda University coming from various parts of the world many centuries ago. What was taught in Nalanda until it was burnt down around 12th century? The vidya sthanas.

  

This was a unique way of introducing the topic. Though this was presented as an area of soft power, i felt that college and school students, should be introduced to the Vidyasthanas as part of their literary clubs and other activities.  

  

Prof. Korada Mahodaya by his talk showed the aspects to be in highlighted in brief talk of 45 mins on a vast area - Vidyasthanas.  

   

The remarkable aspect by which I was thoroughly inspired from Prof, Korada Mahodaya's talk was his simple and implicit shraddha about the Bharatiya rishi parampara and Acharya paramapara. As part of teaching, learning and research pursuits we keep questioning and discussing
various theories and concepts proposed by our Acharyas. But at the same time reverence and sharddha towards them who opened up those areas for us is essential which includes mentioning their names with appropriate prefixs such as Acharya or Muni etc. Such reverence for the Acharyas oozed in the talk of Prof Korada mahodaya.

Jayaraman
