Dear Roland Steiner,

  

I went through a part of the reviews of the attached pdf's. As a scholar yourself do you think Germans down the line have ever defined what they mean by the word 'method'. While going through the reviews I was reminded of Marx's use of terms like 'Criticism, Critical Criticism, etc.' which mean very little in content.

  

While dealing with India, Westerners should be aware that India is pragmatic in the way they see reality. They solely rely on experience rather than intellectual squabble while trying to unravel hidden reality (truths). It is for this reason that India has not produced polemical literature the way Germany produced and what is being produced in the West today. Indians also need to be aware of this method and not indulge in it for the sake of Phd's.

  

Phd's are not research papers, they are just qualifications for admission into the peer group of scholars. This is how education and scholarship has been institutionalised in the West and what is being followed blindly in India today.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
