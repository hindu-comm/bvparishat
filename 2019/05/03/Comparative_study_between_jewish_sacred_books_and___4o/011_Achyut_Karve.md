Dear Roland Steiner,

  

Further to my previous email my simple question is can Indians look at Marx the way Germans look at him? and its corrollary can Germans look at the Geeta the way Indians look at her?

  

The next question I would like to ask is whether there has been any thinker after Marx who can think of philosophy the way Germans think, think of politics the way the French look at it and think at economics the way the British look at it?

  

Can we not see the muddle into which Britishers have landed themselves on account of the Brexit referundum just because they cannot understand its politics the way the French understand it?

  

I think Indologist should refrain from passing value judgments on Indian scriptures by making a comparison with their own? India is an ancient country. The people of this country described things as they saw it first hand and not as they imagined it to be. They had no baggage to carry.

  

Our task is to make an effort to understand how they managed to see it the way they did without pride or prejudice. We have not only lost our tail, we have lost many more things in the course of history which are valuable even in the contemporary world.

  

Just think the way Indians looked at numbers and the way the Greeks and the Romans looked at them when they wrote them. It is here that you can see the Indian mind at work.

  

We need to keep the following dictum of the Geeta in mind.

  

'पर धर्म भयावह'.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
