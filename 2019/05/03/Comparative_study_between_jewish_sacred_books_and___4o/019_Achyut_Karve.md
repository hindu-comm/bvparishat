Here is a how a German mind works while he engages himself in criticism.

  

Comments on the article written on The Nay Science. A History of German Indology, by

Vishwa Adluri and Joydeep Bagchee by Eli Franco

  

"This is a pure fabrication on the part of the authors."

  

What is the fabrication if they have just voiced theiropinion from an Indian perspective? What can Indians do if

Germany did not have a fixed border for their country till 1945 and when Germans claimed that all the German

speaking regions of Europe ought to have been the borders of Germany?  

  

"While the stratification of the Indian epic into ear-

lier and later phases, the issue at the core of this book, is not a current concern of any

particular German scholar, in the case of the Ramayanạ it is currently undergoing the most

vigorous examination by, for instance, John Brockington, emeritus of the University of Edin-

burgh, and arguably the greatest living scholar on Indian epic literature."

  

I am reminded of the great discussions in Marxist study circles in Mumbai about the young and the mature Marx.

As if what he wrote when he was young was in contradiction to what he wrote when he grew up.

I think Germans fail to understand things as an evolutionary process.
They cannot understand things until they stratify them into parts.

In short they are the worst when it comes to history.

  

"However, the fact that we cannot untie the knot does not mean that there is no knot."  

  

Can anyone explain to me the sense that the above sentence makes? I, at least for one, could not

understand what sense the sentence intends to convey.

  

"On the question whether the Mahabharata was written by a single author?"

  

How important is it whether it was written by a single author or many.
Germans must know

that even today you can find many Vedic Brahmins who have the Samihas committed to memory.

That epics like the Mahabharata or Ramayana came down generations by the word of mouth before

they were put on paper is what a German head cannot think of. Contrary to the Indian perspective for a

German nothing can be preserved until it takes a written form. A form which he thinks has permanence.

From an Indian perspective that is permanent which can be passed from one generation to another not

as something external like paper and ink but as something internal.

  

"Viewed as a whole, this is a sad book; and it is sad that many readers may be misled into  

thinking they are holding a scholarly book about ‘German Indology’ in their hands. Actually,

the book is simply a clumsy attempt to avenge an insult. One of the two authors, Vishwa

Adluri, is a failed PhD student of the late ‘German Indologist’ Michael Hahn, who Adluri

promptly accused of standing in the tradition of Nazi scholarship (incidentally, it may be

mentioned that Hahn, who died in 2014, was of Jewish extraction). This explains, I think, the

nasty and indignant tone that runs throughout the book, which may be seen as a personal ven-

detta against ‘German Indology’. It might also be worth mentioning that as a result of his com-

plaint, Adluri was awarded a PhD in (‘German’?) Indology from the University of Marburg

without any ‘German’ Indologist evaluating his work (see Hahn, 2011)."

  

This is how Germans become personal when they have nothing to offer by way of criticism. What difference does it

make whether Michael Hahn was a Jew or a Christian. A German Christian is no better than a Jew. Read Karl Marx/s

essay on the Jewish Question. Semiticism and Antisemiticism are but two sides of the same coin.

  

"German Indology’ is not,at its core, a ‘nay’ science; rather, ‘German Indologists’ wanted to accomplish for India what

their fellow philologists had accomplished for Ancient Greece and Rome—and presumably,

some of them still have this aim. Looking back at what they have accomplished over the last

200 years, they have not done such a poor job."

  

Did Indians ever ask for help from the Germans.  

  

"Gandhi, for instance, who contributed  

greatly to its current popularity and the image of its ‘sanctity’, first heard about it when he was

in England, and first read it in an English translation."

  

You can get scores of commentaries of the Geeta written not by Pandits or Vedic Scholars but by people who gave themselves

to the cause of Independence. The reason why they wrote them was because they drew strength from the Geeta to fight

the colonialists. In fact this is the essence of the Mahabharata and the Ramayana that it give strength to the later generations

to fight injustice. The Ramayana and the Mahabharata are not dead dogs. They are not mythical stories. They epitomize the

the way Indians thought of History. 

  

" Under such circumstances, we as ‘German’ and other Indologists may gladly accept the epi-

thet ‘nay science’ for our discipline; we gladly say ‘no’ to this promotion of ignorance, shallow-

ness, arbitrariness, prejudice and eccentricity by the authors, and say ‘yes’ to serious,

methodically sound and sober scholarship free of allegedly ‘traditional’ and political con-

straints by Hindutva ideology and the like."

  

What is Ideology other than a world view and a personal view at that.
Subscription to a particular

world view does not make a person to have that world view. The word ideology is itself an abstraction

and a loose one at that. That Germans cannot stand criticism is well known. That is also what Bijoy Misra saw

in the interactions he had with you on this forum "He belabors to make some point and

fails to appreciate and understand any other point."

  

Finally, I have no grudge against the Germans. Germans are free to look at the epics the way it suits them.

But to look down upon Indians as being incapable of understanding their own literature under the ruse of the word

scientific is anything but true.

  

Final comment. For a German a donkey is not what he sees while it is alive but the one which is brought dead

for a post mortem and analysed after being torn into pieces. For the German the real world is not earthly. He can

only see it when it is sublimed by the spirit of God.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
