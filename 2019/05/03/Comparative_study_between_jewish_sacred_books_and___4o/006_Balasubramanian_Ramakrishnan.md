Prof. Barbara Holderege's book was already suggested by Shankara-ji. Some others that I know of are:

  

1\. Hananya Goodman, "Between Jerusalem and Benares: Comparative Studies in Judaism and Hinduism,"SUNY Press (October 28, 1994). Also see<https://www.academia.edu/366617/Judaism_and_Hinduism_Cultural_Resonances>

  

2.Alon Goshen-Gottstein, "Between Jerusalem and Benares: Comparative Studies in Judaism and Hinduism".

  

3.Alon Goshen-Gottstein, "Same God, Other god: Judaism, Hinduism, and the Problem of Idolatry (Interreligious Studies in Theory and Practice)".

  

I haven't read the last two books yet - they are on my list. But I have read Prof. Holderege's book and Goodmans. The former is very, very, good - but very heavy reading. The latter is interesting, but not that heavy, including a very, very lightweight chapter by O'Flaherty. It's the kind of stuff you woudl expect in a dinner conversation, but somehow made its way into a book.

  

Regarding 2 and 3, you may consult<https://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2019/03/25/interview-with-alon-goshen-gottstein-on-same-god-other-god-judaism-hinduism-and-the-problem-of-idolatry/>

  

It begins: "Moses Mendelssohn argued over two centuries ago that Hindus were not polytheists but monotheists who worship God through a system of symbols misunderstood by Westerners. Mendelssohn argued that images of the divine in Hinduism are symbolic the same way the rabbinic stories of the cherubim embracing are symbolic. An outsider would misconstrue the story of the cherubs, so too Westerners misconstrue the symbolic nature of Hinduism, which is actually part of their healthy human understanding of God."

  

This may also explain in part the racist origins of German Indology, which was very anti-semitic and Nazi influenced, and the racist overtones continuing to this day, as explained well by Prof. Adluri and Dr. Bagchee.
