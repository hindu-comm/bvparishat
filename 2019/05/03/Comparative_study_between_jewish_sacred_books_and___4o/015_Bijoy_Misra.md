I have not read the Naysscience book by Adluri and Bagchi to offer

a considered comment. But I have interacted with Dr Steiner in

a previous context in this list. He belabors to make some point and

fails to appreciate and understand any other point. I have not

studied philology, but have my reservations on accepting philology

as a scientific discipline. The world language research has to make  

substantial advance before we can really make any comparative analysis.

Correlation studies are not useful in my view.  

I call upon all researchers to work to produce a theory of human language.  

Best regards,
