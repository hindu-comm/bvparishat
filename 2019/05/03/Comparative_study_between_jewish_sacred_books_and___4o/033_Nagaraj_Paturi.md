Dear Prof. Misra,

  

Thanks for your words of appreciation.

  

As you are aware, we are at least as proud as Bhaaratiya Vidvaans as a German Indologist is as a German Indologist and are at least as sensitive towards the patronizing comments and absurd misrepresentations of India, Indian ancient and modern scholarship, Sanskrit, Indian culture etc. by a section of western Indologists including a section of German Indologists as western Indologists in general and German Indologists in particular are towards the criticisms of western or German Indology.
