Dear Mr. Karve,  
  
Please allow me to be frank: Not only you are subject of a fundamental  
misunderstanding of what philological research actually is or should  
be according to its own intentions. It is defined by its method and  
its topic. For example, German philology means the study and analysis  
of German history and culture by historical-critical methods. The  
nationality of the individual researcher does not matter and must not  
matter. If it matters, it will not be historical-critical research to  
this extent. It is not about affirmation or disapproval or "value  
judgments", but about (criticizable/falsifiable) analysis. Everything  
else is not indological research in the proper sense.  
  
With regards,  
Roland Steiner
