Dear Mr. Karve,

  
  
\> do you think Germans down the line have ever defined what they  
\> mean by the word 'method'.  
  

Yes, I do -- if you replace "Germans" by "Indologists". The *primary* method of indological research is called "historical-critical philology". Its end is the study of Indian culture and civilization.

  
  
  
\> While going through the reviews I was reminded of Marx's use of terms like 'Criticism, Critical Criticism,  
\> etc.' which mean very little in content.  
  

In the context of indological methods, the terms "critical" or "criticizm" have nothing to do with Marx or Marxism at all. In short, "critical method" means "distinguishing method", analytical examination.The history and interpretation of this term is long and intricate.

  
  
  
\> India is pragmatic in the way they see reality. They solely rely on experience  
\> rather than intellectual squabble while trying to unravel hidden reality  
\> (truths).  
  

I do not subscribe to this simplifying generalisation.

  
  
  
\> It is for this reason that India has not produced polemical  
\> literature the way Germany produced  
  

What do you mean by German "polemical literature"?

  
  
  
\> Phd's are not research papers  
  

They are. Some are better, some are worse.  
  
  
With regards,  
Roland Steiner
