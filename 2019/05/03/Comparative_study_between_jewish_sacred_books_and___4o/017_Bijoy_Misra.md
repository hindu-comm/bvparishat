Dear Dr Steiner,  

You should have read the whole message

and give your response if any.  

Partial paraphrase is what is unscientific in  

the research discipline and absolutetely useless

in language research.  This could be the  

root of "Nay Science"  

  

And, no further comment is necessary..
