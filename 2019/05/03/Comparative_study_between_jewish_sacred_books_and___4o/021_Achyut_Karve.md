Dear Scholars,

  

There is a good side too of the Germans. See their machines. See their design and compare it with those of the French, the British and the Americans. They put their heart into it. But that is not true when it comes to Philosophy or Humanities.  

  

There is nothing to feel apologetic of our past. We Indians have never had to render our apologies to any country or people in our whole history. We need not learn to interpret our past from the West. The world has had to pay a price and is even today paying a price for the deeds of the West. Take the case of the world wars or even today the case of Vietnam, Iraq, Afganistan and many other countries the world over. It is the Jewish mind, the mind of the merchant, under the garb of Democracy that is at work.

  

Take the case of Science and Technology. In a matter of two centuries the West has brought the earth to ruin. This has not happened because they innovated. It is because they used the innovations for self aggrandizement. Exploiting what ever they could by consent, deceit or force. Colonialism in its true sense is nothing but this Western mind at work. In the process they have generated a mythical sense of superiorty among the people of the world to which atleast we should not fall a prey.

  

A man or a people should not be judged by what they say but by what they do.

  

Why are Western Indologists so interested to find who compiled the Vedas rather than being interested in who protected them and how they were and are being protected. They are just interested in owning it and that too in written form.

  

Method, Critique, etc are empty phrases. Patanjali in his Mahabhashya has clealy stated how one should go about describing a subject. He says make a general rule and then state exceptions. What remains to be added is giving reasons for the exception so that one can get a better hold over the environment in which the subject is placed. Has this same method not been followed in Newton's first law of motion by stating the exception as a condition.

  

For example see the Ashtaadhyayi or the Yoga Sutras. See the plan of rendering the subject. Can we find a parallel.

  

Beauty does not lie in how a face looks. It is not in whether it is white, black or blue. It lies in how it is presented.

  

कोई सूरत खूबसूरत या बदसूरत थोडी होती है।

अदाए उन्हे बनाती है।

  

All this because we need to assert our past the way it is with all its strengths and weaknesses so that we can carve a better future for ourselves and the world at large.

  

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
