Dear Mr. Nagaraj,

We have to keep racist and anti-semite comments in a different class from snide, rude, paternal and indulgent comments. Just as murder and burglary are different - not painted as alike- both are bad things. We need to have moral clarity on this, in my view. The consequences of the two are different- and ought to be different.

This thread should be closed with a simple strong condemnation of a blatantly racist comment. German scholars need to respect Indian scholars more or in a different way is a new topic of discussion. There is no way to mix the two.

-Lokesh
