Prof Paturi,  

I totally appreciate your objectivity in moderation

and allowing free speech. The only point I would request to all

is to be objective. Mud-slinging has been a characteristic

in Indology research in the west, BVP should keep an eye on

anyone engaged in mud or active with a brush to repaint.
