Dear Prof. Misra,

  

We did not take the threat aspect if any in Dr Steiner's post. Members unsubscribe for their own reasons.

  

But we agreed with a certain discouraged and unacceptable aspect in a post pointed out by him and brought the member under moderation. The post landed here because the member was not under moderation. It is a difficult task to go through all the details in all the posts particularly when they come from the non-moderated members. When pointed out, we take suitable action. That is what we did.
