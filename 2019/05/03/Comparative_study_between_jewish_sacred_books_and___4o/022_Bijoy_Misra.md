Dear Sri Achyut and friends,

We are going off-track from scholarly work. A general commentary on world civilization is a topic on its

own and has to be analyzed with its own objectivity and due scholarship. All comparative studies need be

replaced by logical studies with no reference frame. This is where India has been a shining example.

Empiricism would win, but only with objective treatment.  

I think this thread is ready to be closed.

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
