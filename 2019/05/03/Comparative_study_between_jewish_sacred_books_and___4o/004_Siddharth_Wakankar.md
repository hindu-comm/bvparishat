It is just possible that you may get some glimpses of this in the wonderful book named Fundamental Unity of Religions by Shri Bhagwan Das,the father of Sri Prakash,the first governor of Maharashtra. It was published by the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan,Mumbai.

  

Moreover, Religions of the World,a publication of the Ramakrishna Mission,Kolkata,also could be read for this purpose.It is a very useful collection of papers on individual religions written by scholars.

  

One more old publication is a Marathi publication from the Oriental Institute, Baroda.Its title is जगातील विद्यमान धर्म and us written by Prof.R.B.Athavale,the scholar who translated into Marathi the entire Rasagangadhar of Jagannath Pandit.

  

I think,these could be profitably read.

  

Best luck in your search and research.  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
