Dear Dr Steiner,

Your mail sounds like a threat. While we should complain to any post

that looks political, we are all participating voluntarily. I don't think every  

post can be moderated. I read about your attacks on Dr Adluri and I  

am not sure if that was a good tactic while the person is not there to defend

his name. It would possibly be a peaceful world if the modern Indologists

appreciate that there exists a native "Indian" view and the the Indology  

literature is barely tangential to the native view. I am sure you are gaining  

such appreciation by participating in BVP.
