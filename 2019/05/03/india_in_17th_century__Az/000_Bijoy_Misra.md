Friends,  

Prof Paturi had posted a chart showing that India had the highest GDP in 1700AD.

I have not researched how the GDP may be calculated. Assuming it to be

gold in land, the following except from a travel diary of Francois Bernier, a French

physician in Aurangjeb's court could be relevant. The physician was in India

1656 to 1668 as he says. He reported to the King of France. The French were trying to

get to Pondicherry,.  

  

Here is the excerpt:

It should not escape notice that gold and silver, after circulating in every other quarter of the globe, come at length to be swallowed up, lost in some measure, in Hindoustan. … Let it also be borne in mind that all Indian vessels, whether they belong to Indians themselves, or to the Dutch – or English, or Portuguese, which every year carry cargoes of merchandise from Hindoustan to Pegu, Tenasseri, Siam, Ceylon, Achem, Macasser, the Maldives, the Mozambic, and other places, bring back to Hindoustan from these countries a large quantity of precious metals, which share the same fate of those brought from Moka, Bosarra, and Bander-Abassi. And in regard to gold and silver which the Dutch draw from Japan, where there are mines, a part is, sooner or later, introduced into Hindoustan; and whatever is brought directly by sea, either from Portugal or from France, seldom leaves the country, returns being made in merchandise.

  

You have to figure out the names.
