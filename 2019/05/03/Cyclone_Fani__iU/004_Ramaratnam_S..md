Dear Professor Madhav Deshpande,

I thank you for the concern expressed. Indeed it was a disaster. Our Kaju plantation in about 25 acres is almost wiped out. Elsewhere also there is large scale damage to property. The Bhubaneshwar Railway station looks like a burial ground now. Yet there is some consolation. Very few people lost their lives. But for the Government's timely action thousands would have perished. It is not easy to evacuate a million people and provide them food and shelter. It was a massive effort. We must also appreciate the meteorological department for the timely warning and accurate weather forecasting.
