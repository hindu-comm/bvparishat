Our University campus is about 100 km away from Puri. The terrible wind and rain lasted for about 8 hours. It was the fury of nature at its height, the like of which I have never seen before. I had made arrangements for food, water and power back up and so we survived. I had also arranged for tying the glass panes tightly with ropes. So they were all saved. Flying glass pieces would be a great source of danger. Yet some asbestos and metal sheets were thrown off, part of the compound fell and some trees also fell. All the mangoes (of about 100 trees) are gone. The damage is estimated at about 10 lakhs but thank God, there was no loss of life. All inmates were strictly instructed to remain in doors.
