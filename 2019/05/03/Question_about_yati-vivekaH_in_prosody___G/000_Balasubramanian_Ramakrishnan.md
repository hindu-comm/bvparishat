namo vidvadbhyaH,

  

I have a few questions about yati-vivekaH or stops within a sentence while chanting Sanskrit verses:

  

1\. If there is a sandhi at the point of yati, is the sandhi decomposed?

2\. If the yati is in the middle of a samAsa, then is the pause still observed?

3\. What is the duration of the yati vis-a-vis the mAtra definition?

4\. Is the yati compulsory? (I have seen even well trained paNDita-s not observing yati)

  

Any pointers to these questions in commentaries would be greatly appreciated.

  

Thank you.

  

Ramakrishnan
