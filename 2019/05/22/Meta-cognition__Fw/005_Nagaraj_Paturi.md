Dear Sri Jinan-ji,

  

Addressing these issues in general is a broad area of study whereas this forum can only focus on the answers to your questions from S'aastras, ancient Sanskrit sources, Indic Knowledge Systems etc.

  

------------

  

How S'aastras deal with cognition is not metacognition in s'aastras. That is just the science of cognition in s'aastras. What s'aastras say about how an individual cognises one's own cognition, what s'aastras say about how an individual is aware of his own awareness what s'aastras say about individual's knowledge about his/her own knowledge etc. come under the topic of 'handling of metacognition in S'aastras

  

-----------------

  

As is well known , ancient Indians excelled particularly in such areas of study of aatmonmukhatva aatmonmukha aspects of human life etc. Vedanta, Yoga, VyaakaraNa dars'ana (as claomed to have been distilled from the Mahaabhaashya of Patanjali by Bhartrihari ) etc.are abundantant in such discussion.
