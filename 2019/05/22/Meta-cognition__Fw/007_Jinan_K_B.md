Dear Nagaraj-ji  
  
My intention in posting the question and then elaborating it was also  
to understand from the context of the traditional Indian knowledge  
system.  
  
But as I am researching the cognitive damages of the present  
educational paradigm I have a very practical need to understand not  
only what was said in the S'aastras, ancient Sanskrit sources, Indic  
Knowledge Systems etc.but also the 'cognitive' process that led to  
this understanding.  
  
So please feel free to write to me directly to explore this further.  
  
Jinan
