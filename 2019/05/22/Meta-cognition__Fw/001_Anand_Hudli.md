If by meta-cognition is meant "cognition of cognition", nyAya uses the term anuvyavasAya to explain the awareness or experience of objective knowledge, such as "this is a pot." The anuvyavasAya is, in this case, of the form "I know this is a pot." The anuvyavasAya is caused by the objective knowledge, as per nyAya. Mimamsa also accepts anuvyavasAya, but says the anuvyavasAya is known through inference. Both these systems, hence, accept parataH prakAsha vAda, which means objective knowledge requires another knowledge to manifest it. This is refuted by advaita Vedanta, which holds that knowledge is svayaM prakAsha, self-luminous. One argument against parataH prakAsha vAda is simple. If knowledge requires another knowledge to be manifested, the second knowledge would require a third knowledge, and so on, leading to an infinite regress. Hence, advaita vedanta says, when we cognize an object, we also cognize the cognition of the object, simultaneously.
