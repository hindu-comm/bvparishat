Dear Vidvans,

  

I think Patanjali squarely addresses this issue in Sutras 20, 21 and 22 of the fourth pada of the Yoga Sutras.

  

In short the cognition of cognition or meta cognition as it is called is awareness on account of the enseatment of the द्रष्टा and not another cognition.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve
