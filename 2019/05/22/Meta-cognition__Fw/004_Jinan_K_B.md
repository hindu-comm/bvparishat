Dear Anand/ Achyut  
  
Thank you for the response.  
  
I hope you won't mind me pursuing this further.  
  
Does it happen simultaneously along with cognition or is there a time gap?  
  
And does it happen as a conscious process or does it happen automatically?  
  
What is the role of Language in this? Or does it have?  
What about thinking? What is its role or does thinking has any role in this?  
  
Does it happen to everyone or does it happen due to some other  
factors? can it be developed if one does not have this ability?  
If you don't mind I would like to ask one more thing.  
  
The following thought came to me this morning.  
  
When Newton SAW the apple falling, could we say it was an act of  
cognition as well as metacognition? It is surely a simultaneous act  
in which apart from just seeing the fact something additional did  
happen which led him to the understanding of gravity. He saw the apple  
falling and he probably also saw that it is the nature of things to  
fall to the ground.  
  
So is metacognition an act of seeing the abstract or recognizing the  
abstract? or could we say was a kind of inference happening though  
metacognition? This inference is automatic and there has been  
sufficient background research that would have happened.  
  
There are definitely prior conditions that enabled this kind of  
SEEING. Metacognition is not a reflection as there is a time gap  
between the action and reflection and reflection is often deliberate.  
  
And metacognition is also not insight. Correct?  
  
So could we say metacognition happens to people who have involved in a  
deep enquiry?  
  
I was thinking of another example of how people who are deeply  
interested in language/ grammar etc also could have this happening to  
them. So they hear what is being said and also at the same time  
cognize the abstract, depending upon what they have been enquiring up  
on.  
  
So could we say that one condition is deep interest and second is that  
metacognition happens when a real experience is happening? That is a  
concrete experience is when both cognition and metacognition happens?
