\> In Malayalam, it is Kāñcana, Pāṇḍava, and Sundara (കാഞ്ചന,പാണ്ഡവ,സുന്ദര) but in Kannada and Telugu I think it is invariably Kāṃcana, Pāṃḍava, Suṃdara (ಕಾಂಚನ,ಪಾಂಡವ,ಸುಂದರ;కాంచన,పాండవ,సుందర);At least I have not so far come across these words written as Kāñcana, Pāṇḍava, Sundara (ಕಾಞ್ಚನ,ಪಾಣ್ಡವ,ಸುನ್ದರ;కాఞ్చన,పాణ్డవ,సున్దర).

  

----- Dear Sri Radhakrishna Warrier-ji,

  

The script symbol 'anusvaara' which is in circle shape is a late entry into the south Indian scripts. It entered as bindu , dot and later changed into circle. It is considered to be an influence from the north Indian scripts. At least in the Telugu script, we can see the dot written on the top side of the base script symbol in its beginning days, just like in the north Indian scripts such as Devanagari. Gradually it shifted to the right side of the base script and got transformed into a full circle.

  

Before this script symbol entered Telugu script, glyphs for vargapanchama i.e., anunaasika were used where anusvaara is now being used. i.e.,కాఞ్చన,పాణ్డవ,సున్దర was the only way it was written in the early Telugu inscriptions.
