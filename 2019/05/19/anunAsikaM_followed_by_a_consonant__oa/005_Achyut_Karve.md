Dear Paturiji,

  

I have given the test. As you may know anuswaras are अयोगवाह letters and are so said by Katyayana and Patanjali. What will one say if all the air while voicing letters only passes through the nose? The word nasika amply describes the articulation of the sound. Why can we not coin a term if none exists? What is wrong in describing an anuswara to be a nasika so that the confusion between an anunasika and an anuswara is disposed off once and for all.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
