Sorry. I didn't analyze all your examples. Please follow the rule I had said whether the anusvara is in the middle of the word, it is mandatory to have parasavarna except before the consanants I had suggested. For the anusvara of saM it is considered as pada and it is optional like संबन्धः/सम्बन्धः . With बन्धः it is correct. बंधः is wrong.
