In Sanskrit it depeneds on the placement of anusvara. If it at the end of a pada, it is optional as as per the rule वा पदान्तस्य। Otherwise it is mandatory. In the examples you have quoted it is as you have suggested. Otherwise it is wrong. Not all consonsants, but except श, ष, स, ह it will take parasavarna as per अनुस्वारस्य ययि परसवर्णः.
