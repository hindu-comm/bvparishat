Dear Vidwans,

  

Radhakrishna Warrier's question is

  

"What is the correct way in Sanskrit of writing words such as the following in which a non-nasal consonant is preceded by a nasal:"  

  

Does the sutraमुखनासिकावचनोनुनासिकः not prohibit the use of pure nasals in Sanskrit? If they do the question of scripting anuswara does not arise at all if an anuswara represents a purely nasal sound.

  

For example in the word संस्कृत what anunasika sound or letter does the anuswara represent?

  

What Radhakrishna Warrier wants to know is whether there is any convention for writing or scripting anunasikas in Sanskrit among scholars.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
