What is the correct way in Sanskrit of writing words such as the following in which a non-nasal consonant is preceded by a nasal:

Gaṃgā (गंगा) or Gaṅgā (गङ्गा)

Kāṃcana or Kāñcana

Pāṃḍava (पांडव) or Pāṇḍava (पाण्डव)

Suṃdara (सुंदर) or Sundara (सुन्दर)

Gaṃbhīra (गंभीर) or Gambhīra (गम्भीर)

In Malayalam, it is Kāñcana, Pāṇḍava, and Sundara (കാഞ്ചന, പാണ്ഡവ, സുന്ദര) but in Kannada and Telugu I think it is invariably Kāṃcana, Pāṃḍava, Suṃdara (ಕಾಂಚನ, ಪಾಂಡವ, ಸುಂದರ; కాంచన, పాండవ, సుందర); At least I have not so far come across these words written as Kāñcana, Pāṇḍava, Sundara (ಕಾಞ್ಚನ, ಪಾಣ್ಡವ, ಸುನ್ದರ; కాఞ్చన, పాణ్డవ, సున్దర). In Hindi, Gujarati and Marathi, I have seen these words written both ways, eg., Suṃdar and Sundar (सुंदर, सुन्दर; સુંદર, સુન્દર). In Malayalam, the exception to the rule is when the anunāsika sound is followed by kh, g, gh, ph, b, bh, and all the letters of the akṣaramāla that come after ma. For example Saṃkhya, Gaṃga, Saṃghaṃ, Gaṃbhīraṃ, Kiṃvadanti, Haṃsaṃ (സംഖ്യ, ഗംഗ, സംഘം, ഗംഭീരം, കിംവദന്തി, ഹംസം) etc.

What is the proper way to write these words in Sanskrit?
