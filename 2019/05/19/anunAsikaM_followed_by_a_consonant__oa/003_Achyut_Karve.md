Dear Radhakrishnaji,

  

These anuswaras generally called यम are not anunasikas.
मुखनासिकावचनोनुनासिकः They are nasikas. That is while phonating them all the air passes through the nose. The easiest way to check whether they are anunasikas or nasikas is to close the nose and phonate them.
If while they are being voiced a part of the air flows through the mouth know them to be anunasikas else they are nasikas.

  

The 'm' and 'n' in English are invariably nasikas.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
