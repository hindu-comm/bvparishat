Respected Scholars

  

I am looking for manuscripts of a text titledTarkasaṅgraha, authored byĀnandajñāna. The text is a refutation of Vaiśeṣika philosophy. A book titled 'Tarkasaṅgraha of Ānandajñāna' was published in 1917 by T. M. Tripathi under Gaekwad's oriental series. It was noted down from one single manuscript from Vadi-Parsvanatha's Bhandara at Patana.

  

I am looking for other manuscripts of the same. Kindly guide.

  

Regards
