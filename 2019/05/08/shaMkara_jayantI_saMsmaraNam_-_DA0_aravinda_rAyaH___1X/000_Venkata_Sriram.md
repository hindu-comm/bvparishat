Namaste,

  

During Shankara Jayanti in the year 2015, our revered member Dr.K.Aravinda Rao Ji delivered a short sanskrit lecture remembering Sankara Bhagavatpada.

  

A short, sweet and crisp message that I cherish and listen to this every year ! This needs to be contemplated again and again till it sinks in mind.
