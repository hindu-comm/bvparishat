Dear all scholars

As you might have experienced, existing fonts for professional publishing in Samskrit are found wanting in many regards. For example, many unicode-incompatible fonts, despite their good looking designs, are not exhaustive in terms of vedic accents and ligatures. Unicode-compatible fonts do cover ligatures, but they still lack Vedic accents; their designs are not considered as good looking as their unicode-incompatible counterparts, in general. Furthermore, since they are available in a single weight they are not suited for publishing.

  

Upon my request, my doctoral student Mr. Krishna Prasad has undertaken the admirable task of complete digitization of Nirnaya-Sagar fonts. One of the fonts has already been released and two more lightweight fonts are nearing completion. I sincerely hope that this project is highly beneficial to many. If you would like to show your appreciation for the same, you can do so by contributing towards the partial compensation of the financial cost incurred in the project, which is Rs. 750,000 currently. Please note that we plan to release the fonts for free after the project-cost has been met.

  

I too have donated 15000 rs for project and prof Shrinivasa Varakhedi too has contributed towards this noble project. Many people in Bengaluru have donated to this cause.

I hope many members of BVP may find it interesting to achieve this fontcraft.
