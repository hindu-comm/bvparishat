Dear scholars,

Namaskarams.

One of my friends intends to make a serious study on the life and works of Jayadeva, the author of Gitagovindam, as a part of his new project - a dance drama on Jayadeva.

In this connection I request the members to provide details about important works on Jayadeva - both popular and research works.

Thanking in advance,

nks
