In October 2018, our **Shastric Research Methodology** Workshop was savoured by professionals and researchers alike from various disciplines, work areas and interests. As a sequel, in association with **Kavikulaguru Kalidasa Sanskrit University,** Ramtek **and Indic Academy,** Hyderabad, **Maharshi Vedavyasa School of Vedic Sciences, MIT ADT University,** Pune invites registrations for a deep dive into a specific exposition convention, namely, **Tantrayukti**.

Tantrayukti is the discourse binding rationale employed in the form of conventions used in Indic knowledge texts. Tantrayuktis ensure to keep coherence and conciseness in expression of scientific treatises such as those of Āyurveda, Arthaśāstra and so on. Understanding Tantrayuktis and identifying their usage is crucial for correctly interpreting seminal Indic scientific treatises. 

On popular demand, we are organizing an application-and-practice-based **2-credit certification course on Tantrayukti** designed and conducted by **Dr. Jayaraman Mahadevan**, Director, Krishnamachari Yoga Mandiram, Chennai.
