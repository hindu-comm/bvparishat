Dear *vidvajjana*-s

  

The Sanatan Mandir at Tampa (Florida), USA, recently had a ‘prana-pratishtha’ ceremony for which they published a souvenir. The publishersrequested me to write a short article on OM for the souvenir. The souvenir has been published and here are the pages (50-52) with my article.

  

  

More on the Mandir and Hinduism in Tampa Bay (from the publishers)

The Santan Mandir at Tampa was established by Dr. Pawan Ratan, a gynecologist. The chair for the ‘prana-pratishtha’ was Dr. Rakesh Sharma, a cardiologist. The committee members included people hailing from northern, western, southern, and eastern parts of India. The Indian population in the tri-city of Tampa-Clearwater-St. Petersberg is around 10,000 to 15,000 people. Though not very high, Tampa Bay has a vibrant Hindu community with three Hindu temples and an India Cultural Center Hall.

  

Thanks, Nityananda Misra
