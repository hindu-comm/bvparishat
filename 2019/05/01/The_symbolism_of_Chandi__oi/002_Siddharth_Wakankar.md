Shri Venkat ji,

  

Very thankful for the link of Sadhana Samara of Jaidev ji.

  

I was frantically looking for a copy of this wonderful book,which is out of print and out of stock.

  

Prof.V.S Aggraval had also written a wonderful book in English on the Saptashati,which is to be found only in old libraries.

  

Once again thanks and regards.  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
