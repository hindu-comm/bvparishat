Good video Rao garu...I have studied few commentaries on Chandi and this western swami is speaking wrell which is inline with sampradaaya.

  

For shaktas, I would recommend to study the following for interpretation of Sri Sri Chandi :

  

1\) Guptavathi of Bhaskararaya Makhin

  

2\) Sadhana Samar of Brahmarishi Satyadev Ji ...available in 3 parts as per the 3 charitaas of Devi Mahatmyam

  

Here is the link :

The annihilation of asurAs in 3 charitAs are granthi-traya-bhedana respectively.

  

rgs,

sriram
