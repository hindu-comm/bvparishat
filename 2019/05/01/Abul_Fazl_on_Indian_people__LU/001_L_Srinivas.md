Abul Fazal seems to have had an idea of India, somewhat before Sunil Khilnani :)

  

It's strange that the Leftist historians of India completely ignore this, as they do Hindu writers of this period and prior periods. See, for example, Bipan Chandra in his NCERT work 'Modern India' where he states that a complete lack of a notion of Indian nationhood led to the failure of the 1857 rebellion. Bipan Chandra is merely repeating what colonial historian VA Smith or even the Colonial administrator Lord Simon (of the infamous Simon Commission) said. I suppose then all roads lead to Nehru - one of the reasons why most writing on Indian history and culture in English are suspect.

  

Abul Fazl wrote in Persian. In Tamil poetry, as early as the 8th century, there's a description of the bhumi devi aka earth i.e., India as the divine lady whose breasts are the peaks of the Himalayas and who's wrapped around in a saree that's the twin seas. In Indian languages, there was no shortage of the articulation of a notion of India.

  

Incidentally, Abul Fazl was assassinated in a complicated plot instigated by Jehangir, Akbar's son. The actual plot was carried out by Bir Singh Bundela, hereditary prince of Orchha, a principality near Jhansi. Bir Singh Bundela was patron to Keshav Das, a famous Hindi poet but as much a Sanskrit scholar too. He is dubbed 'कठिन काव्य का प्रेत' on account of his erudition. He came from a family of Sanskrit scholars. As schoolboys, we were told that in his house even the servants spoke Sanskrit. Apart from much poetry, he also wrote alankara texts in Hindi.

  

The town of Orchha and its fort complex are still very much intact. The architecture here looks distinctive and a little different from Delhi-Agra type buildings. The buildings in Gwalior, Indore and Maheshwar seem, to my untrained eye, to have been partially inspired by Orchha. Apparently Lutyens was inspired in part by the 'pepper pots and domes' seen in the buildings at Orchha.

  

Hope this helps,
