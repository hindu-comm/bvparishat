Dear friends,,

I happened to read the English translation of Ain-i-Akabari of Abul Fazl last week.

First one notices the enormous analytic scholarship of the man. Though his family

had already been a few generations in India, the comprehensive description of India's

history and culture in a readable volume is a splendid scholarly effort. Apparently

Akbar had missed school, so the effort was to prepare him to know the land and the

people. Here I quote from Page 8 in the translation

  

Shall I describe the constancy of the inhabitants or record their benevolence of mind? Shall I portray the beauty that charms the heart or sing of purity unstained? Shall I tell of heroic valor or weave romances of their vivacity of intellect and their lore? The inhabitants of this land are religious, affectionate, hospitable, genial and frank. They are fond of scientific pursuits, inclined to austerity of life, seekers after justice, contented, industrious, capable in affairs, loyal, truthful and constant. The true worth of this people shines most in the day of adversity and its soldiers know not retreat from the field.

  

This is around 1590 AD. The could be the first commentary on Indian people by a person

of foreign descent who was born In India.  

  

Our seminar is on May 4. As usual I invite our friends who might

be in the area.  

  

Best regards,

BM
