Pranama-s to all BVP scholars,  
  
Here is the logical conclusion of my postings in the recent past on related topics, put in a very dumbed down fashion (precise argument will take a drastically different form):  
  
1) VARNA = DISTINCTION  
You don't give distinction to slaves.  
  
2) Varna-s as a functional idea:  
is restricted to the crown (urban centres, "the other") of a Vaidika civilisation. Varna people = "deva-s on earth via professionalism."  
  
e.g. Krishna's jAti-kin did't have Varna in the village, but had Varna in the urban centre.  
  
3) \[analogy\]  
Just as Shiva has an uneasy relationship with yaj単a, Shudra-s have an uneasy relationship with yaj単opavita. This doesn't mean that Shiva cannot be accessed by yaj単a, or Shudra-s cannot have yaj単opavita; but would be rare.  
  
4) The reason \[analogy\]:  
Shiva of all devata-s is directly connected to Jagat; Shudra-s of all Varna-s are directly connected to Jana (the ruled). This is simply the way of reality.  
  
5) Shudra-s are, therefore, dvija-s.  
All Smriti texts then must be put through the filter proposed in Mimamsa 1.3.4.  
  
6) Why is Shudra mentioned last always?  
First answer this: Why is Shiva mentioned last always in "Brahma-Vishnu-Mahesha"?  
  
7) Mahabharata indicates that Shudra-s (discerning enough to have not participated in Krishna's bhArata) had gained ascendency in Saraswati region.  
  
8) "Harappan" has the signature of a Shudra defined civilisation state. This is where impeccable Mahadevan errs.  
  
9) In Kaliyuga, Varna-s become jAti-s, just like other jAti-s (tribes). This is the scenario even in Mahabharata: Varna-s not working together (having lost the Adhyatmikta power within their genesis), elites committing crimes without check.  
  
10) Even then, Shudra-s due to their connections with Jana (a sea of misfits in Kali age) become naturally placed to lead them. Shudra-s, though coming with a natural Shaivite tilt, build-up the structures as secular, as concession.  
The alternatives: kill off the misfits yourself, let them kill others and get killed, capitalistic "survival of the best", migrate to other places, etc.  
  
11) Unlike other Varna-jAti-s, Shudra-s by remaining under the radar of Western gaze have avoided existential damage. Today these unidentifiable \[to the materialistic gaze\] people have become our only saviour.  
  
  
  
PS:  
1) The purpose of this monologue is to build "mental road", not to provide a water-tight argument (everything has their own time) - as outlined in the opening line.  
2) As I mention the word "monologue" here, there is no guarantee that I will reply to any postings in this thread.  
3) This monologue also marks an end to the spurt in my postings on BVP.  
4) I wrote this out of conviction.  
  
  
  
regards,  
KT
