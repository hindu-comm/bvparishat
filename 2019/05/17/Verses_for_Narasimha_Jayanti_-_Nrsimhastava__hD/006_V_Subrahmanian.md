There is a Mallari performance in Nadaswaram. Is it related to the deity Mallari by any way?

**What is a Mallari?**

Like the tradition during the temple rituals, there also prevailed a special pattern for temple processions, the most important being the rendition of Mallari. During processions, whenever*Deeparadhana*was performed, the Nadaswaram and the Tavil played as an ensemble - a rendering based on Tillana in raga Gambheeranata. This is called Mallari. This practise continues even today.

Each performance weaves a unique type of Mallari. During the Siva Tandava (the frezied dance of Lord Siva), his anklets gave rise to the Jati-s, "Tha dhi Tom Nam". This formed the basis of jatis for several percussion instruments like Mridangam. Further sounds emanating while striking the two hands on the mridangam produced "Dhim Dhim, Tham Tham". This forms the basis of the Mallari presentation, wherein the performer intertwines the*Alarippu*and the special jatis of the Tavil, "Kunda kundagu - Diruta Kundagu", to the raga Gambheeranata.

Subsequent to the detailed presentation of Gambheeranata, the other Ghana Pancha ragas, namely, Nata, Gowla, Arabhi, Varali and Sriragam are played. Todi is also rendered. The five types of Mallari are:

Teertha Mallari - while the*Tirumanjanam*is brought

Taligai Mallari - while the*Naivedyam*is brought

Kumbha Mallari - while giving the*Poornakumbham*

Taer Mallari - when the deity is taken up for procession

Purapattu Mallari - when the procession of the deity starts

One significant Mallari is Triputa tala Mallari, based on seven beats either as "Takita takadhimi" (3 + 4) or "Takadhimi takita" (4 + 3).

The Taer Mallari which has 5 beats is repeatedly handled on the procession days. No other Mallari is handled during the procession day.

Except a few like Triputa Mallari and Taer Mallari, Taligai and other Mallaris do not have any specific tala structure (beats). These would depend on the performer's creativity.
