Prof. Paturi,

  

There is a Mallari Mahatmya book which contains various stotras, sahasranamas, and a detailed account of the Mallari incarnation of Shiva written along the lines of Devi Mahatmya. There is a practice among people, whose family deity is Mallari/Khandoba, to read this Mahatmya during the first six days of the Margashirsha month, culminating on the Champa Shashthi. Most people that I know, however, read a Marathi version or the Kannada version. The Sanskrit version is used in the Mallari Homa, again along the lines of the Chandi Homa, which is conducted in a large scale in places such as Devaragudda, Karnataka. These places draw huge crowds every year and the festival really reinforces the faith that people have in Mallari. In Maharashtra the place to visit is Jejuri, where the deity is called Khandoba. Devaragudda, the name often used in Malatisha or Malatesha.
