\> Mallari or Malhari is a typically Maharashtrian and Kannada God not much known outside these places/ states.

  

----- This deity is worshiped by the shepherd caste called as Dhangar in Maharashtra, Kuruba in Karnataka and southern Andhra Pradesh and Kuruma in Telangana. In Kannada and Telugu , he is also called as Mallanna. Mailari is the other name of this devata. In Maharashtra typically the word Khandoba is prevalent. Biroba is the caste origin hero (the first shepherd) worshiped as another devata by this caste Dhangar. Biroba is called Beerappa in Kannada and Telugu.

  

The caste and cult have been studied extensively by the late Prof. Gunther Sonthiemer

I studied the Telugu counterpart of it in the Raayalaseema (southern Andhra Pradesh) and Telangana for decades.
