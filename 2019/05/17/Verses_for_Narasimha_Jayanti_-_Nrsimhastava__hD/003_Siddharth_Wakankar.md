Dear Anand and Prof.Paturi,

  

A very good, pleasant and simple but effective poetic composition.Congrats for this enterprise.pl.continue this endeavour and get punya.

  

There is one very rare work still in a manuscript form deposited in the collection of the Oriental Institute,Baroda.It is named Mallari or Malharimahatmya and it has a Sanskrit commentary by one Shri Kalamkar.I forgot his first name,but,am sure that still this [ms.is](http://ms.is) not printed by any scholar, because, Mallari or Malhari is a typically Maharashtrian and Kannada God not much known outside these places/ states.

  

It will be better if anybody works on bringing out its Edition or Critical Edition based on other MSS.deposited in different Libraries.

  

Some youngster can/ should work for his/ her Ph.D. on this rare but important text.It would be my pleasure to help him/ her if it is needed.

  

Best luck in your search and research on this rare text.

  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.  

Vadodara.9427339942.
