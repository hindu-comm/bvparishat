Hello Prof Jha,

Please accept my heartiest congratulations Jha-ji for this great award. It is indeed wonderful when one of your own friends is recognized for his/her unique contributions to scholarship. We are lucky to have scholars like V..N. Jha who can instruct even the most difficult navya-nyāya topics in a manner easy to grasp. There are, I am sure, may more awards in the offing for you Jha-ji and we sure will hear of them soon.

Congratulations to Ujvalā as well.

All the best
