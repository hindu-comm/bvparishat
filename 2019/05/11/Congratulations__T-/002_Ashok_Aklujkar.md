Would the correspondents mentioned below or any other BVP member kindly specify what award Prof. V.N. Jha has received? Somehow I did not see any helpful post in that regard on BVP. I too would like to congratulate him appropriately. (I normally congratulate privately in order not to increase the volume/size of stored BVP messages.)
