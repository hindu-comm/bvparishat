Dear members,

  

One of the most eminent Naiyayikas of our nation, respected Prof. V.N. Jha ji has been honoured with 'Swami Vivekananda Memorial Award' conferred upon him by the University of Calcutta, recently. His teaching style is quite simple and highly attractive. No need to say that he is an active member of our forum.

  

May he be conferred with more such awards for his valuable contributions to Indian philosophy.

Humble pranams and hearty congratulations to him.  

  

Best regards,

Prasad
