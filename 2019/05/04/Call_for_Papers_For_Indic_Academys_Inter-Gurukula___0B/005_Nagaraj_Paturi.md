If we would like to have a look into the Gita in this context, the word 'smriti' (considered to be the Sanskrit root /chaayaa/equivalent of the Buddhist Pali word 'Sati') as a category/concept of inner world can be seen in

  

क्रोधाद्भवति संमोहः संमोहा*त्स्मृति*विभ्रमः।

स्मृतिभ्रंशाद् बुद्धिनाशो बुद्धिनाशात्प्रणश्यति।।2.63।।

  

Here, we can see 'smriti' being mentioned as a function considered as essential for the healthy functioning of 'buddhi'. The derailing of smriti is mentioned as leading to the destruction /dysfunction of 'buddhi'.

  

Whetherthis 'smriti' of the Gita is the same as or different from the Buddhist 'sati'/'smriti' is debatable. But the common aspect between the two is that both are concepts of the inner world.  

  

In the idea that 'sati'/'smriti' is achieved through a certain exercise of meditation, may be different from the idea that in a healthily functioning buddhi 'smriti' is theorised to be already underlying. But even the Buddhist idea of sati/smriti also seems to be that the meditative exercise makes the exerciser to reach the already existing sati/smriti.

mindfulness is kind of jaagriti.

  

A few verses later to the above, we have

  

या निशा सर्वभूतानां तस्यां जागर्ति संयमी।

यस्यां जाग्रति भूतानि सा निशा पश्यतो मुनेः।।2.69।।

  

The inner world is the world of nis'aa for all the bhootaani. jaagriti towards that is being considered to be the feature of a samyamee/muni. Mindfulness is this jaagriti.
