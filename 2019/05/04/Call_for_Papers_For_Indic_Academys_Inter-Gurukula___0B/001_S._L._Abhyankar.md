Your outline, very nicely composed, really, very nicely composed, provoked churning मन्थनम् Just sharing that =>

Is not essence of controlling the mind in अभ्यासेन तु (कौन्तेय) वैराग्येण च गृह्यते (गीता 6'35) ?

अभ्यासेन = by practising by oneself = by being भोक्ता (भुज् / भुञ्ज्+ तृच्)

वैराग्येण = by detachment = by being an observer = by witnessing = by deliberating with a third person's perspective.

Of course, the line अभ्यासेन तु (कौन्तेय) वैराग्येण च गृह्यते has the preface असंशयं (महाबाहो) मनो दुर्निग्रहं चलम्

It is all about controlling the mind, by being *mindful*, by beingstudious, by doingअभ्यासः of the ways of the mind

Ways of the mind = चित्तवृत्तयः => चित्तवृत्तिनिरोधः योगः (इति पतञ्जलिः)

Ways of the mind साङ्ख्यम् => साङ्ख्ययोगः कपिलमुनेः  

Since Your outline, very nicely composed, provoked churning मन्थनम्,am left wondering whether the whole episode of क्षीराब्धिमन्थनम् is an allegory on churning of the mind, on "mindfulness" ?! Gods were motivated to undertake क्षीराब्धिमन्थनम् for the lure of अमृतम् Rather, Vishnu wished that Gods, rather, everybody should understand what अमृतत्वम् means and that knowledge can be attained only by क्षीराब्धिमन्थनम्, by practicing "mindfulness".

Recently it came to mind that in मृत्योर्मुक्षीय मामृतात् the मोक्ष from मृत्यु need not be taken as freedom from death, but, rather, freedom from fear of death. The syntax should focus, not on मृत्योः मुक्षीय rather it should focus on मृत्योः बन्धनात् मुक्षीय The thought of death is frightful and engulfs the mind. Making mind free from fear of death can be achieved by Mindfulness अभ्यासेन वैराग्येण च.

Entire कठोपनिषत् is a dialogue between नचिकेतस् and यम. It all started with irritated वाजश्रवस् saying मृत्यवे त्वा ददामीति But innocent (or highly intelligent ?) नचिकेतस् had no fear of death. Actually नचिकेतस् went directly, to death only ! What is etymology of नचिकेतस् ? Does it connote freedom from fear (of death) - freedom from undulations of the mind न चिकेतस् ? Is the name नचिकेतस् idiomatically coined ? By that token does कठोपनिषत् become a treatise on Mindfulness ?
