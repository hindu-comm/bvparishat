Namaste

  

I have talked to many aged people. They are not afraid of Death. They don't have fear of Death. They are afraid of suffering before Death. If Death comes quickly they welcome it. No fear. But they have fear of suffering for a long time and then dying. Everybody wants to avoid suffering in Life and when dying.
