Friends,  

  

Here is the video of the Monday's lecture

"Nature and Spirituality".  

  

<https://lincolntv.viebit.com/player.php?hash=8AcZwlo7sD4b>

  

Lincoln is an old small town (population 5000), a part of the

triad of towns in American Revolution. The lecture is held as  

a public Endowment event in town at the Senior Center. The  

seniors are mostly retirees from the local educational and  

business institutions. I serve as a member of the Housing  

Commission (elected) to help create equitable housing for the

residents. The town website is <https://www.lincolntown.org/>

  

The lecture is an effort to develop an analytic insight to spirituality  

via the science of nature.

  

Best regards,  

  

Bijoy Misra
