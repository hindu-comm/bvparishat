This does not directly answer your question but in the attached file, I have collected Krishna's views on the relationship between Karma and Jnana in the Gita and outside of the Gita in the Mahabharata, supplementing this with what other shastras have to see (only illustratively, ignoring for the time being similar teachings from the Uddhava Gita). The compilation is a little haphazard and needs to be fine-tuned.

  

This attachment does not cover the views of the classical Vedanta systems on the matter. I personally feel that bringing in hairsplitting arguments in the various commentaries especially from the schools of Advaita Vedanta, only confuses the student. Invoking the latter necessarily involves explaining various categories like Nitya, Kaamya, Naimittika etc., but these classifications do not provide a good framework to understand what the Gita is itself saying. Gita's views on Karma and Jnana, to me, appear to approximate those of Dvaita, Vishishtadvaita and Pratyabhijna Darshanas (as reflected in the Gita commentaries of these schools). All these schools have different opinions on mapping 'Niyat' karma to the three Mimamsa categories, and going into that much detail makes things very complicated.

  

Today, our webmaster uploaded the slides that I use as a framework to teach the Gita to teenagers. It is a story based curriculum (drawing them from Hindu scriptures and tradition), and the text accompanying will be uploaded later. Here is the link.

\[The sections on Dhyana Yoga will appear deficient and that is because we have a Yoga/Meditation teacher cover these topics through practice over 3 weekends\].

  

With regards,
