namaskar,

  

I am looking for a simple overview (ppt, tabular format or some paragraphs or articles), which gives some details of comparison of the views of different systems: particularly

advaita, visistadvaita, dvaita, buddhism, achintyabhedAbheda pertaining to:

  

karma and jnana and their relationship

  

I will be teaching this concept in my Gita Classes soon. I know such concepts are hidden in the bhashyas spread over several chapters of Gita. However, if someone has made a study, I like to find out.

  

Thanks to several members who sent me a lot of materials on Gita.

I am looking for a focused view on karma and jnana only.

  

  

*Best Regards,*
