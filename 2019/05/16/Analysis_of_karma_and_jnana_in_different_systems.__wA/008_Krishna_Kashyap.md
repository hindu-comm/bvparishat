*At the very outset, I have to let you know that: I am not a scholar. I am not a full time philosophy teacher or student. I have studied only here and there under several gurus. Fundamentally, I am working as a engineer / business men in technology for years. I have spent more than 35 years in USA. Hence, I may not even be the right person to teach this subject. However, I am deeply interested and have dedicated several hours a day for the last 30 to 40 years on this subject. I am not teaching this at an university level with any serious rigorous treatment. I am only doing my best to explain the main views on Gita as per different acharyas.*

*I teach via Google Hangout, which allows only 10 live participants and unlimited youtube subscribers(who listen to lectures offline; they dont participate live).*

*Age: preferably post high-school or college level people. No social / cultural requirements. I am teaching mainly summary views of Sri Shankaracharya, Sri Ramanujacharya and Sri Madhvacharya on Gita. Going line by line is very extensive and inappropriate to my audience. To let them know fundamentally the gist of what the original words of Gita mean and how these different acharyas have expressed their views. This is all done with a view of "samanvaya" among different acharyas. I know that several people feel that such a samanvaya is not possible and unfair and these three views or incompatible with each other. However, one of my gurus, MahAmahOpAdhyAya K.S Varadachar has spent his entire life (he is 98 years old now) focusing on how such a samanvaya dristi is possible. I am adhering to those principles and teaching the text to come up with a coherent view. People may agree or disagree. I am just trying to impart the spirit and the principles hidden in Gita.*

  

*My audience is general public, who may not have time or capability to understand original bhashyas.*

*There are no prerequisites. Some sanskrit knowledge is useful. However, I try to explain the ideas in english so that modern people can get the views of these acharyas without struggling with Sanskrit language or inter-scholastic debates which are complicated even for the advanced level students. Having said this, I am not an expert in sanskrit language. I have working knowledge of it and I have learnt Gita in particular several times and taught the subject 3 times to other students in the last 3 decades.*
