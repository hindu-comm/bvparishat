Namaskar,

  

My response should be understood in the context of the intended audience of the class being offered. I think Krishna Kashyap-ji's class is meant for those who are not necessarily scholars in Darshanas. The various Vedanta sampradayas have their own internal consistency and are complete in all respects. But the Gita is only 1 of the Prasthanas, and searching for all Vedantic teachings of a sampradaya in the Gita is not necessarily a good idea especially if the students do not have a firm grounding in their own Sampradaya.

  

The categories of Kaamya, Nitya-Naimittika are more suited to PurvaMimamsa contexts. As an example of how the ordinary student will get confused if we teach traditional Bhashyas to them - please read the traditional commentaries on Gita 18.1-3. Some Acharyas state that all Kaamya Karmas are to be abandoned. Others say that even karmas classified as Kaamya karmas (e.g. Ashvamedha) ought to be performed if they are 'Niyat', but without attachment, or a desire for fruit (see in this regard the Dvaita commentaries).

  

In Shankaracharya's commentary (and subcommentaries thereon), all Karma is rejected, and only Shaariira Karma (needed for maintenance of body) is allowed to Paramahamsas (to borrow what Madhusudana Saraswati says). It appears sometimes that the Acharya considers even the goal of chittashuddhi as a desire while performing yajna-tapa-daana. In other commentaries, the duties of Varna and Ashrama are included within the 'Niyat Karma' category, and the phrase 'shaariira karma' itself is interpreted in various ways.

  

To return to my original reply - it was written keeping in mind the intended audience of Kashyap-ji. My reply does not apply to those who are doing a rigorous study of a specific Bhashya(s) in the traditional manner, and are studying their specific Darshana comprehensively.

  

Regards,

  

Vishal Agarwal
