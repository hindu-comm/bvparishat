I am not sure as to how the arguments from the bhAShyas could confuse a student unless the student is unqualified as required in the orthodox sampradAya or is taught by someone who is oneself confused! The very ideas of the bhAShyas, at least in Advaita Vedanta, is to clear the confusion, far from causing it.

Without the differentiation between kAmyakarma on the one hand and nitya-naimittika on the other, karmayoga cannot be understood in Gita.

Even if we leave aside Advaita Vedanta, it is difficult to see as to how Dvaita and Vishishtadvaita are put in the same statement as ideas being approximated in both darshanas. I am not sure of the last school mentioned.

I am surprised to know that the schools of Vedanta differ on how karmas are categorised! If so, it would be interesting to see the differences.
