Yes I knew Gerry (as we fondly called him) very well and had close connection with him throughout his life. A very warm and friendly person he would go out of his way to befriend like minded scholars and always enjoyed a good banter. In spite of his busy schedule he volunteered to
review of my four volume Yogavārrtikā work .for the Journal of Indian Philosophy. He also wanted me to contribute to hisYoga volume in the Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies series. He had great persuasive powers and his friendly disposition always made it very difficult to refuse him. He was so pleased with my article on  “Revisiting the concept of Jivanmukti in Sāṅkhya", in *Theory and Practice of Yoga: Essays in Honour of Gerald James Larson,* (ed) Knut Jacobsen, (2005) Reidel, Holland) and wrote a touching note to me which I will always cherish. A good friend, a great scholar and an admirer of Indian knowledge systems has passed on and attained 'kaivalya' or the Sāṅkhyan 'apavarga'
