Sir,

  

Here's his list of books/monographs from Wikipedia. I could not get a full list of his articles.

  

He was the author of a definitive work on classical Samkhya and the editor, alongwith Dr Ram Shankar Bhattacharya, of a landmark volume on Samkhya and another seminal volume on Yoga in Dr Karl Potter's Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophy series.

  

His last book was a detailed translation and commentary of the Patanjala Yoga Sutras with Vyasa's bhashya and Vachaspati Misra's Tatvavaisaradi, published by MLBD last year.
