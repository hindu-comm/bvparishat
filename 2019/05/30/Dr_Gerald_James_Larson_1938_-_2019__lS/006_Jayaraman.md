I recently had an opportunity to look at Prof.Larson's latest (last?) work - Classical Yoga Philosophy and the Legacy of Sāṃkhya (2018) - a massive 1000 page work on Sankhya and Yoga. I feel, only single pointed devotion to the chosen field can bring about such a work. Or as stated in the Gita - पूर्वाभ्यासेन तेनैव ह्रियते ह्यवशोऽपि सः -he continued his work from his past lives.  

  

Moreover I often refer to Encyclopaedia of Indian Philosophy (volume on Yoga) that Prof Larson co-edited with Sri Ramshankar Bhattacharya.  

  

Great tribute by Prof.Rukmani Maataa to Prof Larson.  

  

My salutations to the great scholar.
