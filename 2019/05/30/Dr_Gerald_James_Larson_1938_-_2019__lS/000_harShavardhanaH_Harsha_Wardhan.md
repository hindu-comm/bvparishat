Friends,

  

I have just come to know that Dr Gerald James Larson passed away last month.

  

I had personal contact with him throughout last year on several points of Samkhya philosophy, and I just want to pay my respects.

  

He was a man thoroughly imbued with respect for Indian knowledge and genuine love for Samkhya and Yoga, his chosen field of study.

  

In an era where India-bashing is increasingly considered*de rigueur*, Dr Larson was steadfast and balanced throughout in his approach and work.

  

  

There is a message on his website which reads as follows:  

  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
*Dr. Gerald James Larson passed away April 27, 2019. He spent his 81st birthday in the ICU, and passed away peacefully, surrounded by family.  
  
Dr. Larson was born April 24, 1938 in Chicago, Illinois and was living in Mission Viejo, CA at the time of his passing.  
  
Dr. Larson was Professor Emeritus, researcher, and mentor to many graduate students within the Dept of Religious Studies for over 25 years at UC Santa Barbara. He chaired numerous committees, and served as both Assistant and Associate Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs over the course of his career. More recently he was Tagore Professor Emeritus of Indian Cultures and Civilization, Indiana University, Bloomington, where he was founding Director of the India Studies Program. He is the author or editor of twelve books and over 100 scholarly articles on cross-cultural philosophy of religion, history of religions, classical Sanskrit and South Asian history and culture. He is recognized as one of the leading experts in his field.  
  
In the past 10 years, Gerry moved back to California with his wife Claire to be closer to children and grandchildren. They would have celebrated their 59th wedding anniversary in June.  
  
He is survived by a family that loved him deeply and includes his wife Claire; daughters Karen, Chandra and Jennifer; grandchildren Amanda, Grace, Samantha, and Ryan; and great-grandchildren Riley and George.  
  
His family will always remember him as being charismatic and full-of-life, outgoing, warm, and loving. He always loved a good discussion or debate, appreciated and encouraged the diversity of people and their beliefs, and could often be found with a good single malt scotch or martini in his hand. “Cheers” Dad, we love you dearly.  
  
A Memorial Service will be held at St. John’s Episcopal Church in Rancho Santa Margarita on May 18th @ 1:00 PM.  
  
In lieu of flowers, a donation may be made to the Organization for Rural Development, a charity supporting rural, poor women in India to achieve economic independence, Dr. Sisir Dhar, President, 12256 Wayside Road, Indianapolis, IN 46256 (IRA No 501 (c3) 81-27313), the Music Dept at St. John’s Episcopal Church, or a charity of your choice.*
