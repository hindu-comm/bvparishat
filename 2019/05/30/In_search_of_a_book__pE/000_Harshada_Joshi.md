Namo namah!

I am writing this mail to this galaxy of scholars with a humble request. I am in search of the following book â€“

**Rgveda Sarvanukarmani of Katyayana and Anuvakanukramani of Saunaka by Umesh Chandra Sharma.**

**The book has been published by Viveka Publication, Aligarh in the year 1977.**

I have been searching for this book for quite a long time in the libraries/on the internet. But am not able to find it.  

I will be grateful if I get some guideline about procuring this book.

Thanking you all,

Harshada Joshi-Sawarkar
