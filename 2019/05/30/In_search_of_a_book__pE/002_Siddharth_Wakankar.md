Dear Harshada,

  

Dr. U. C.Sharma,a friend of mine,was a student of the late Prof.Dr.V.G.Rahurkar of the Centre of Advanced Study in Sanskrit, Pune Uni.So, it must be available in CASS or BORI or Jaykar Library of Pune Uni or Deccan College.

  

Just try there to get its xerox or get it on inter.library loan service

  

Best luck.  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
