Amazon posted photos of Hindu gods and goddeses on doormats and toilet seats, this has previously been done in 2016 where Tricolor flag was also sold on doormats.

I have cancelled my prime subscription, deleted my account, and rated the app lowest on PlayStore.

Amazon should make a mechanism to avoid this in future, and that is only possible if Hindus and even other Bharats unite.

I urge everyone in this group to forward this message to as many as possible.
