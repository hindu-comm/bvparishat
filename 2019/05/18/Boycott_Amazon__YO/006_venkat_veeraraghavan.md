Dear Rishi,

  

It is not a question of not caring or nor being scandalised by these. The issue is one of whom to blame. Amazon would have been to blame if they had kept these "products" on display even after the protests.

  

There is only so much a global conglomerate can do in terms of vetting products especially when the variety is in the range of millions. I am not a spokesperson for amazon, but merely putting across the other pov.

  

This is an issue from crypto and recent converts along with rabid proselytisers who exhibit over enthusiasm in humiliating Hindu deities. Potty mouths and empty heads Kamal Hassan, Prakash Raj and Apaswara Bhaskar are cases in point. By focusing on them, you give them wind for their fledgling sails.

Ignore and they will lose relevance.

  

Social media is a curious platform where every person gets their 15 minutes of fame deservedly or not. Once a person or person(s) gets used to the dopamine from all the following and the likes, they are pretty much controlled by the mob psychology. They cease to have a mind of their own. The loci of identity with these people is outside themselves. The masks they have are a function of their followers.

  

Sanatana dharma otoh is about refining oneself as far as possible so that we can evolve and raise the overall consciousness of the world we live in through personal example. Dharmo rakshati rakshitah. By protecting dharma we are protected in return. The result of "activism"
is incidental upon personal example and power just as a magnet does not go about trying to attract iron filings, but creates a field around that aligns the world around itself.

  

Not trying to be preachy here, but we can realistically only hope to control our actions. Activism is good, but emotional attachment to the fruit is not healthy. My 2 cents.

  
Kind Regards,

  

Venkat
