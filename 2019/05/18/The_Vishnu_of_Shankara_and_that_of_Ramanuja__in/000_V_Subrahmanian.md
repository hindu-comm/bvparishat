Here is an article, of 11 pages, which is a short study based on literary evidence from the writings of both Shankara and Ramanuja that shows the idea of 'Vishnu' is different for both these Acharyas. This article is not intended to invoke polemical discussions. The sole aim is to bring to the fore the fact of fundamental difference in the perspectives of both the Acharyas with regard to the concept of 'Vishnu'.
