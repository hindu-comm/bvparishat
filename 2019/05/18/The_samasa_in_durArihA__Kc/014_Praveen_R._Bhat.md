Subbuji,

  

There is no dIrgha per se before the words, as the upasarga is not hrasvAnta दुर, but it is दुर्। In your earlier three examples, you can see they are just varNa-melana. However, in दुरारिः/दुरारी, as Vidvan HN Bhatji said, it is followed by another upasarga आ or if it is dhAtu ऋ, then the following प्रत्यय having णकार as an indicatory/packaging (इत्) letter, it causes vRddhi making it आ, before the varNa-melana with the upasarga दुर्।

  

Also, thanks for the image from VSN-bhAShya, but I do need to trace out the book for the entire VSN.
