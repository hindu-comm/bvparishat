Namaste

  

In the Sri Vishnu Sahasra Nama the 781 name is 'दुरारिहा'. I would like to know how this word is parsed. Is there an upasarga 'dura' which is prefixed before 'ari..'? I request scholars here to kindly clarify my doubt.

  

There are other two names in the list:

|     |          | |-----|----------| | 780 | दुरावासः |



|     |           | |-----|-----------| | 81  | दुराधर्षः |

  

Thanks and regards
