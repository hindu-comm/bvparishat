Namaste

  

My question was because of the following examples: दुरहङ्कारः, दुरवगमः, दुरभिमानः.....Here we do not have a deergha sound before the basic words ahankara, avagama, abhimana... But in durAriH, why is there a deergha before ariH? Maybe the grammar rules that you have cited explain this.

  

warm regards
