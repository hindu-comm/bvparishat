Siddhanta Traya Sarah is a unique book that renders the three siddhanta-s namely Advaita, Vishishtadvaita and Dvaita in a condensed form. MM Sri R.Krishnamurthy Sastrigal has compiled, rather translated from the originals, in Tamil for the benefit of those who cannot approach the three doctrines in their original form.

  

Swami Vidyaranya's 'Vaiyasika Nyaya maalaa' which gives in verse form the essence of each adhikaraNam of the Brahma sutras is the source for the Advaita section.

  

Vidwan Kapisthalam Sri Desikachar's 'shaariraka adhikarana ratnaavali' is the source for this school's section.

  

Sri Raghavendra Tirtha's 'Nyaya Muktavali' is the source book for the Dvaita siddhanta section in this book.

  

The book is unique in this respect that it offers in one book, of 500 plus pages in Tamil, an overview of the three doctrines.

  

The attached 13 images contain the commendation letters of Vidwan Mani Dravid Sastrigal in Sanskrit, Vidwan K.E.Devanathan's Tamil article on his appreciation of the rendering of the Vishishtadvaita section (by pointing out some ten instances where the author's excellence is very noteworthy) and Dr.Haridasa Bhatta's letter in Sanskrit is a note of commendation for the Dvaita section and the entire book. The blurb has a profile of Sri Krishnamurthy Sastrigal.

  

Sri Krishnamurthy Sastrigal's note tracing the genesis of the book and its completion scans several interesting incidents, in Tamil.

  

As several persons have suggested that the book deserves a translation into English and Kannada and perhaps Telugu and Hindi, I request those who can take up this work, from the three doctrines, to come forward. This way, the burden will get distributed. Those who are interested may kindly contact me off line to discuss the modalities.

  

I request members who know Tamil to kindly buy this invaluable book which is available at a subsidised price of Rs.300. The book, hard-bound, is very elegantly produced. Each siddhanta is printed in a different color. Copies can be had at the residence of Sri Krishnamurthi Sastrigal, close to the Madras Sanskrit College, Mylapore, Chennai 600 004.

  

Here is the link to the book release function held at Chennai where a summary of the Brahmasutra bhashya according to Advaita and Vishishtadvaita has been delivered by Vidwans Sri Mani Dravid Sastrigal and Sri K.E.Devanathan in Tamil. Dr.Haridas Bhatta (Dvaita vedanta) could not be present at the function due to personal reasos. Prof.K.Ramasubramanian (esteemed member of BVP), the illustrious son of Sri KrishnamurthySastrigal, has given the introductory talk. It is a very enjoyable function in deed:
