if we read the text without assuming anything (the poet was no keeping track of the names he used, there were interpolations etc), the text means that Aruna had a wife called Syeni and both of them begot Jataayu. We do see that names repeat. We have so many Mahalakshmis and Subrahmanyams in our family, across generations.
