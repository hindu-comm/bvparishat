*Dear Scholars,*

*While I was going through theAraṇya-kāṇḍa 14th chapter (Ślokas 15-32); I was caught with a doubt.*

*  
*

*Jaṭāyu relates his lineage to Lord Rāma, so on;One of Kāśyapa-s wives,Tāmarā gave birth to five beautiful daughters: Krauñcī, Bhāsī, Śyenī, Dhṛtarāṣṭrī and Śukī,and Śukī gave birth to Natā, whose daughter was Vinatā, and Vinatā gave birth to Garuḍa and Aruṇa. Aruṇa, the charioteer of the Sun God.*

*Later this śloka mentions;*

तस्माज्जातोऽहमरुणात्सम्पातिस्तु ममाग्रजः।  
जटायुरिति मां विद्धि श्येनीपुत्रमरिन्दम।।3.14.32।।*  
*

*The first pāda states - We, the Jaṭāyu and Sampāti are the sons of Aruṇa, (who is also called as Anūru) the charioteer of Sun. And the very next pāda states - Know me as the son of Śyenī.*

*As per the contextŚyenī must be the great grandmother or so, toAruṇa. Then how comeJaṭāyu claimsAruṇa &Śyenī as his parents. Did Aruṇa really married hisgreat grandmotherŚyenī?*

*  
*

*Kindly give some clarification in this and help me out!*
