Namaste

  

Here is a small pdf on the Life and Works of Dr.Kunjunni Raja:

  

<https://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/40241/5/chapter1.pdf>

  

In this article there is a mention of Dr.K.Raja's work on a biography of Shankaracharya in Malayalam. Is this publication available in any form? Is there an English translation of this biography? Any leads to this would be helpful.

  

Thanks and regards
