Namaste,

  

A beautiful website and information on Brahmarishi Daivarata, the foremost and favourite disciple of Kavyakanta Ganapati Muni.

  

..............  

<http://www.brahmarishidaivaratha.org/index.php>  

................  

  

It also contains some of the works of Brahmarishi and some rare photographs of the sage of modern era along with his tapas-sakhi. He was the torchbearer of the vedic vision of Ganapati Muni and took it forward.

  

Some of the e-books have been published online along with Mula Yajurveda Samhita.
