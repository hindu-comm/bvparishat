Dear listfolk,

  

Does anyone any idea where to get the book on rituals based on the mantras Daivarata saw and were collected in the Chandodarshana?

  

<http://www.brahmarishidaivaratha.org/about.php>  

  

\>the Kalpa the ritualistic manual based on the Mantras and the Süktanukramapika—the detailed contents of the Süktas—the Anuvakas, —is being published with complete translation into English done by two scholars of repute, the late Sri DevuduNarasimhasastry and later after his sad demise, by Prof. S. R. Malagi of Bangalore.  

  

Thanking in advance,

  

Sreekar.
