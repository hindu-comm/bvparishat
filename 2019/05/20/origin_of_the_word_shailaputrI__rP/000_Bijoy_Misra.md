Friends,

I am scheduled to give a talk today on a topic I chose "Nature and Spirituality".

In preparing for the talk, I thought about the word शैलपुत्री used for the Devi in

the scriptures. Scientifically the phrase would have a geological explanation,

ie a speculation that earth crust was mountainous to start with and the soil

is created from the degradation of the rocks. In the present science, it is what

the models are suggesting. The ocean bottom is all rocks etc.

I wish to ask if people would know the first use of the above phrase and the

context of its use.

Thank you.
