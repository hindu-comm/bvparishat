I did come across the phrase in DeviMahatmya.

The question is if there was any speculation that the earth is a product of the mountains.

Ramayana talks about the mountains "flying" around and being dropped here and there.

This is not unlike the geological process of plate tectonics.

What I would like to know how such legends may develop.  

Parvati as ground to be Himalaya's daughter fits the scheme.

So the thought that शैलपुत्री may not be a total labeling effort.
