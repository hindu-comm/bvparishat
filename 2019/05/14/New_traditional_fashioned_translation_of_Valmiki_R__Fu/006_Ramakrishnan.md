Namaste Dāmodara Dāsa ji,  
  
Thanks for sharing the details of this publication. I am sure this will be of great benefit to millions of people who do not know sanskrit.  
  
Could you please share which ancient commentaries have been used for this translation?  
  
However, without following the anvaya-krama and going straight to the tātparya after padavibhāga and pratipadārtha (without anvaya) will not pass the test of scholarly or traditional methodology of interpreting ślokas.  
  
Some of the translations are funny, like translating pitāmahaḥ (referring to Brahmā) as 'grandfather' rather than more properly as 'patriarch' (a reference to the puruṣa-sūkta would have been in order to aid those who may not follow why Brahmā is called by this kinship term).  
  
There also seem to be some typos, for example at page 232, saḥ is translated as 'the' instead of 'he'.  
  
Others have mentioned about overly literal translations of terms like puruṣa-sārdūla (which may be acceptable for Western 'dictionary translators' but not for traditional Pandits).  
  

The printed text does not appear to follow traditional orthographic conventions for example इ**ति**-उक्तवचनं or इत्युक्तवचनं would both be more appropriate than इ**त्य्** उक्तवचनं as in the verse below. Having divided इत्युक्तवचनं into independent words, it retains other long compounds as-is, like the one underlined below.

Hopefully all these comments would not be misconstrued as being overly critical, I fully understand the labours that would have gone into this mammoth exercise, and I hope the translation is improvedfurther as it will need to be of a much higher standard to be called excellent.

  

Thanks,  
Ram
