Dear Dr Nori,

This is the trap defined by Goldman and Co.

The logic is colonial and must be abandoned.

Sanskrit is a living language, it lives by itself and also

through many other local languages. The usage and interpretation

are expected to respect the local living use and not "archival" use.

This is my opinion.  

Having said that I struggle with my work every day! I do interpretation

first, translation after years. There could be other methods, but not

a dictionary method.  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
