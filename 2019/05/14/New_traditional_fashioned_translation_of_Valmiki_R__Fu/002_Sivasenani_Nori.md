A deliberate - and valid - translation technique is to import the foreign idiom into the target language. This does not do the harm that translations which add the tranlator's own interpretation on top of the original do. The advantage is that it gives a flavour of the source language.

  

Whereas the sutra उपमितं व्याघ्रादिभिः सामान्यप्रयोगे indeed ordains purvanipata when a comparison is made with Vyaghra and others, and therefore पुरुषो॓ऽयं व्याघ्र इव पुरुषव्याघ्रः is the correct resolution of the compound purushavyaaghraH, the translation 'tiger among men' ought to be seen the equivalent of 'man like a tiger' adapted for readability.
