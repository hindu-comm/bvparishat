Respected Vidvaj-janas,

Pranams.

  

This is a link to Bala kanda of Valmiki Ramayana translated into English by Vidvana Gauranga Das:

<https://www.amazon.in/Sri-Valmiki-Ramayana-Canto-Volumes/dp/B07R8KJR2C>

  

This is a result of 3 years of effort by a scholar who is practicing Krishna Consciousness since the beginning of his life and who has studied in a traditional gurukula. You can say his translations are traditional style.

  

Special features:

  

\* Word to word meanings to each sloka

\* English transliteration alongwith devanagari

\* A short Commentary based on commentaries of previous acharyas

\* Translation is also based on previous commentaries

\* Translator has tried to give as exact translation as possible that is inline with traditional commentators, not worrying for what the people influenced with modern ideas will say.

  

Attached is a sample chapter of this book.

I suggest all the vidvaj-janas purchase and read this.  

  

This may prove as a small attempt in counteracting modern renderings of Ramayana that are spoiling its spirit.

  

More to come. Project is to publish one canto (kanda) per year. Krishna willing, this attempt may find success.

  

Thankyou,

Hari Guru Vaisnava das,

damodara das
