Namaskar.

  

The poem about our Mother by Kavi Yashwant Dinkar Pendharkar gives eternal truth. Remember the Marathi songs like Premasvarup Aai or Aai tujhi athavan yete from the Marathi Drama,Duritanche Timir jaavo etc.

  

We have a Matrudina which is celebrated on Shravan Amavasya and my mother was very particular about this day.This is our Mother' Day,but, hardly,anybody from new generation knows it or follows this.

  

My wife,my elder sisters and my vahinis still do this and our wards,sons and daughters, make it a point to be present.
