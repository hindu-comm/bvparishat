Dear Prof.Paturi,

  

The following was or is the practice.

  

There will be खीर/ पायस in seven small bowls and one puri will be kept on every vaatee.The mother will ask: who is the Atithi and every son/ daughter will take or utter his/ her name and collect that vaatee from behind the mother. This is done when the mother gives this bowl keeping it on her head.

  

The seven bowls may be representative of the Seven Chiranjeevis and she is giving this ashirvad to all her offsprings.

  

I hope,am clear.Sorry,I have to use some Marathi words,which you will definitely understand.

  

Thanks for this query.

  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
