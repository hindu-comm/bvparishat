Hadn’t heard of Mother’s Day, Father’s Day or Valentines Day before coming to the West two decades ago. Don’t think such celebrations were part of the Indian tradition. Showing respect and affection (and actually having these) to parents, siblings, or spouse was considered part of everyday dharma, not just for celebrating once a year.
