How can there be a source or Smriti which names Mother's day and then say that the eternal statements (meaning they are always valid) of mAtru devo bhava and pitru devo bhava are not to be recited on Mother's day or Father's day? This is like saying "Can there be an evidence that names a vandhya(barren woman) and her son?" Just as Barren woman and having son can not go together, eternality and exclusion on some specific days can not go together.
