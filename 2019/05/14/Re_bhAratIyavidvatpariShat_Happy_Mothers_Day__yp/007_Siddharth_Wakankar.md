Shriram ji,

  

Thanks for this kind gesture.

  

We do follow this tradition till today,but,the next generation is almost innocent of these traditional practices in orthodox families and it is difficult to convince people about its importance in modern life.

  

One more personal detail.

  

My grand father, Swami Achyutanandatirtha,was blessed by Markandeya and gave him the vidhi of Markandeyapoojana,which is to be performed on the Tithi of your birth.I do this puja every year for more than 72 years now. Both the daughters of mine also do this puja. This is how we celebrate our Birthdays,without lighting and blowing off the candles. I told

them that we worship Tejas and should not blow off a wick and till now,they observe this.

  

I would like to talk to you as well as Paturiji,but,I don't have your contact numbers.

  

Excuse me for this digression.

  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
