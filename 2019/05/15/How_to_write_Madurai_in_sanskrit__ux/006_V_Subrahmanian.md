I think the Madurai of Tamilnadu was originally known as 'thenmathurai'
(south Mathura): <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Pandyan_Kingdom>

  

//Pandya became the epithet of the first Pandyan king of Thenmadurai (*lit*. south[Mathura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathura "Mathura")),//

  

This theory can be substantiated by a usage of Aandal in her paasuram (Thiruppaavai)

**மாயனை மன்னு வட மதுரை மைந்தனைத்\*  
  
தூய பெரு நீர் யமுனைத் துறைவனை\***  

  

//வட மதுரா தேசத்து மாந்தர்க்கு அரசனும்,//  

  

The word 'vaDa Madurai' in Tamil is really 'the Mathura where Krishna ruled from, located in the North India'.

  

Corresponding to that the Madurai of the Pandyan Kingdom is 'the Mathura of the South India'.

  

Going by this, the Madurai of Tamil Nadu should be spelled 'mathuraa' and in Tamil since the थ is only 'da' or 'tha', all similarly written, and the elongation of stree linga becoming 'ai' like in 'seethaa = seethai', we have mathurai now pronounced as 'madurai.'

  

If the above scheme is accepted, Madurai should be written as 'मथुरै', I think.

  

भरतः is pronounced in Tamil as 'B(h)aradan' and भारतम् is pronounced as 'B(h)aaradam'.

  

Scholars may kindly give their opinion on the above.
