I presume you are speaking about the city in Tamil Nadu the name of which is transcribed in English as Madurai. Unlike Sanskrit and other Indian languages, Tamil doesn’t have aspirated consonants. Voiced consonants (like ga and ba) are there in the spoken language but not in the written language. So, the letter ‘ta’ serves for both the ta and da sounds of Tamil, and also for the aspirated tha and dha sounds of other languages. मतुरैcorrectly transcribes the name as it is written in Tamil and मदुरैwould represent the standard literary pronunciation of the name. So, either is OK but my personal preference is for the latter (मदुरै).

  

Wonder about the etymology of the name of this Tamil Nadu city. My view is that it is from the name of the North Indian city MathurA. Buddhists or Jainas might have brought this name to South India. In some Prakrits MathurA becomes MadhurA. This can easily become Maturai / Madurai in Tamil. In Malayalam, the name of the city is transcribed as Madhura which can also mean sweet.
