Here is the Social Science curriculum for Gr IX an X

India is stuck in 1930. Please take initiative to make a petition.

The education has to be useful to one's future. By teaching methods, we create

service people, the schools have to teach to create thinkers. We have to create  

scientists, not Assistants. The overhead jobs also have to change. We have

to engage the youth in creative inquiry than colonial skills training.  

  

There should be substantial nationwide reflection how India got occupied.

How did the 25%GDP get down to 2% GDP? We have to engage the students  

to study and analyze. The grading must be done on analytic thinking than

reproduction of bookish material. The old colonial history books have to be  

abandoned for the sake of new India.

  

It appears that the curriculum makers apparently are not familiar with the

literature in Sanskrit. There is void from the Mohenjodaro to AlBiruni.

  

I thank the individual who shred the syllabus.

  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra  

  

Hope BVP scholars would take up.

  

Best reagrds,
