Dear Vidwans,

  

Here is a photo copy from a 5th Std. Text book.

  

Looking at the intention of history does it not appear that dating history is just an exercise to show superiority of a people in historical time? Should we fall a prey to such gimmicks when most of the sources of our history are oral?

  

We need to remember that the West has no oral traditions of history and therefore they define the historical period as one whence man started writing.

  

We need to look as to how our history will help us become a better people rather than engaging in self praise.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
