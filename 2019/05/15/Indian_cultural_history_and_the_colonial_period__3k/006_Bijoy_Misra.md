A BVP Friend has shared the NCERT syllabus which apparently is online.

Hopefully many of the educators would take time to work with the authorities to  

advise them to help create the Indian identity than rehashing the British. Looks  

like there is a bureaucratic ignorance. There are many in the country engaged in  

digging through the cultural heritage. It is time that the new findings come to  

the education of the children in the schools. An engineer should be aware what  

he is capable of rather than what he can learn as a student.
