Dear friends,

  

Our goal in India Discovery Center is to help create a map of cultural attributes

that can be traced to the history of Indian civilization. About ten of us get engaged  

for six months to study the available documents for a "period" and debate through

how the period places itself in history. We discuss the likely attributes for the "period"

that can be "weighted" through to construct an Indian personality.  

  

We divide the history into eight periods with somewhat flexible time markers

and converge on a two-word phrase to characterize the period in the process of  

evolution.  The following lists our groups' conclusions so far.

  

1. Indus Period (5000BC-2000BC) - Industry and Innovation

2. Vedic Period (2000BC-700BC)  - Language and Organization

3. Classical Period (700BC-200BC) - Literature and Conduct

4. Golden Period (200BC-500AD) - Analysis and Aesthetics

5. Hindu Period (500AD-1500AD) - Art and Design

6. Mughal Period (1500AD-1800AD)  - Faith and Perseverance

  

Yesterday I stated to formally study some of the colonial period literature in preparation  

for our next seminar (Nov 2). While the Mughals tried to oppress, India survived. It seems

that the the colonial period tried to dismantle India's cultural foundation. The divisions

multiplied. It is possible that the shackles have modified the tone in the country. The liberal

creative India seems to be shelved in the archives. (BVP is a hope!)  

  

We are planning our first Youth seminar (persons below 35) on July 27 with a title

" Influence of Culture in Life and Living". It would be a hearing session. We want

to hear what the modern youth thinks. Please feel free to offer any opinion or any

analytic ideas if you are in the age group we want to assemble.  

  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
