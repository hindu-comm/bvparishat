Thank you Prof Iyengar.

Currently the naming of the periods is arbitrary (it is a label), the time separation is what we are interested.

We are checking how to index, we may say Period I, Period II etc. We start writing next year.  

  

The attributes are determined through a round table discussion. So I would consider them as the view

of this small group. Others may come up with different sets. We do our own analytic review in creating

the meta-phrases. We reduce to two words since our goal is to help create educational material for

middle-school and high school students. We take the view what a teacher can present in the class

and what resources we provide to help the teacher teach. I would love to see a different set, but it  

must be analytic. Our claim is that we are mapping ourselves in the world as objectively

we can. We are our "observers," We use direct-meaning English words for a number of limited  

but contextual reasons.  

  

Since we are abroad, we also think of world history as we move. We plan several teachers' focus  

groups in the next two years. We need help with course curriculum in Indian schools to be relevant

back home. I would love if any one can post the middle school and high school syllabus on

culture and history.  

  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
