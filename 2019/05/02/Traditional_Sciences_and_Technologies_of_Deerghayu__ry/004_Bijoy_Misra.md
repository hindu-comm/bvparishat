I don't have charaka samhita in front of me.

As I recall the sickness is due to the mind (चरित्र later).

And there is prescription to keep the mind clean.

His statement that the patient must have a clean mind to heal himself/herself sounds bold in concept.

A clean mind would never die!  

Before we know, the mind is already unclean!
