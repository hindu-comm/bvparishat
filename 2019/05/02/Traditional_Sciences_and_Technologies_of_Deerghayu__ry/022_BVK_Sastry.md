Namaste Prasad garu



You have raised a number of points and consequence of it is a long response with references. please bear.



1. I agree with you on the principle of Ayurveda serving as \<
**'personalistic medicine' than 'disease-centric medicine.**'> **Question to ponder is** : When was the lost time we saw this model of Ayurveda Vaidya professions and teaching ? Where did we lose the light of Charaka ?



 If my information is correct, the method of ' Personalized ayurveda' went out of social practice , even at villages at least hundred years ago. The change trigger was urbanization and government policies on medical education, profession and Insurance. The social media of movies created hypes on both extremes - praising and decrying Ayurveda ! The combined professional of 'Village/ Kula Purohita- Vaidya- Jyotishi' is a lost tradition. The deep roots of this damage goes back to the loss of Yoga way of studying Samskrutham, planted at India in the colonial regime.



This is a historical roll out and nothing emotional to argue here. See url: <https://www.themindfulword.org/2014/history-of-ayurvedic-medicine/>-

During the mid-1500s, Garcia D’Orta, a Portuguese doctor and naturalist, printed an Indian medical book called Conversations on the Medical Simples and Drugs of India in 1563. He collected information about disease case studies and plant properties from many local physicians as part of his extensive research for this work. Unfortunately, in the 1600s, feuding began between the Portuguese and Indians. One consequence was that the Portuguese outlawed Hindu physicians.

At the end of the 1600s,Hendrik van Rheede, a Dutch colonial governor and naturalist, prepared, with help from a small army of physicians and botanists, the comprehensive Hortus Malabaricus, a 12-volume set that described approximately eight hundred Indian plants and their medicinal properties. These volumes were published in Amsterdam between the years of 1686 and 1703.

By 1833, the British East India Company had banned all Ayurvedic medical institutions and opened the first Western medical university in Calcutta. During this time, as was the case with Chinese medicine in China, Ayurvedic medicine was kept alive only in the rural areas where people either could not afford Western medicine, or were geographically dispersed from the larger urban areas where it was available. Any Ayurveda training was received from a private college or taught by families secretly sharing medical information with each other. The British Pharmacopoeia became widely used, a standardized compilation of Western drugs. Its popularity helped to further decrease the medicinal use of Ayurveda plants, flowers and herbs.

Ayurvedic medical schools were reopened in post independence era.
Ayurvedic doctors find place with Western doctors in hospitals to provide complementary medical care. All-India Ayurveda Congress now counts itself as the largest medical organization in the world. Current lead brands were ushered in by efforts like Arya Vaidya Sala of Kottakkal founded in 1902, at Kottakkal; Sadvaidyashaalaa of Mysore was founded in 1913.



 **We can sure talk of 'great theories', claim ' pride for historical achievements', which do not find a social resonance or living continuity in our generation. The debate neither takes out the greatness of the subject, pride of us as surviving part of great heritage or make the debate lead to any form of restoration of a great globally relevant profession. **



2. I agree on your note : \< Charaka ... food and medicine differ. How can we compare all these between east and west.> The question again is : What has been / being done to restore this wisdom in ' Ayurveda Products- production/ mass distribution- market capture- Personalized prescription> in the context of National Public Health ? A simple example: Marketing of Ayurvedic medicine'! Example :Ashwagandha, brahmi.. like generic medicine at pharma shops , for ' buy on fly' reading customer reviews and claims ! Where is personalization ? What is promoted is ' mass consumption'.



3. On \< Commit no mistake by saying that goals of Hippocratic and Ayurveda are similar \> the current medical professions - Ayurveda and Western medicine have moved farther away from the basic principles that the founders like Charaka and Hippocrates promoted. ' Dukaartasya prashamanam, swasthasya swaasthya rakshanam' - is the underlying ideal of both. Methods do differ. As far as ' belief systems on cause of disease and suffering, India also has its share of attribution to non-material intangible causes ( which in popular language becomes bhoota- preta cheshtaa, maata- mantra parihara....). explore: <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4263393/pdf/jmehm-7-6.pdf> ; <https://greekphysician.weebly.com/goals-of-hippocrates.html> .



 The patch up explanation with the glorious expression ' daiva-vyapashraya' is without understanding the ' concept of daiva in Ayurveda' . Current Ayurveda is keeping out the ' Vedanga Jyotisha / Yoga based diagnostics' outside of education and practice is a statement of fact. No emotions attached. It is our choice today - Do we make efforts to understand the text correctly or go to rectify the errors of practice or ratify the practice as a 'cultural inheritance' are to be debated.



You may also peruse the official NIH publication on this point: The conclusion of state of art of Ayurveda academics in India , published in 2011, available at the link
(<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3095267/> ) reads as below: The study indicates that there are some serious flaws in the existing system of the graduate level Ayurvedic education. Only a good exposure to basic clinical skills during the medical education can produce a confident physician. Though many topics related to the essential clinical skills are included in the curriculum, the education system has not been able to produce skillful clinicians. Since the Ayurvedic graduates play an important role in the primary healthcare delivery system of the country, this study seeks the attention of governing bodies to take necessary steps ensuring the exposure of the students to the basic clinical skills. Along with the strict implementation of all the regulatory norms during the process of recognition of the colleges, introducing some changes in the policy model may also be required to tackle the situation.



4. On definition of \< Health/ spiritual Health>, the same error has taken place in Ayurveda Practice guidance ! The goal of ayurveda which started with ' desire for longevity with a desire to have good health of body and mind ( deergham jeevitum icchamo .....) has yielded to the 'roga / baadhaa - prashamana' as a criterion for ' goodness of doctor's services'. The shift of Ayurveda from 'Swasthya' to ' Aarogya/ roga-abhaava' has been a result of social dynamics. This shift took place in India way back before even the formation of WHO ! Should we not address this issue as a ' in house' correction in Ayurveda Education
and Practice ? To trigger a side question, how many ayurveda universities carry 'Srimad Bhagavad- Gita guidance of Yuktaahara viharasya/ Satvika aahara' education as a part of syllabus, highlighting Ayurveda as ' Ayur-Yoga ??



5. On \< Most of the Ayurvedic pharmacy is business oriented. Spurious drugs are available in market.> So ? What is the suggestion ? Action ?



6. On \<Indeed, I've a different question. Are not we deviating from the 4 highest goals of human existence, when we indulge in talking about increasing longevity? \> I am also asking the same question: The precise articulation being which is pointing to the disconnect of current Ayurveda with ' Yoga- Samskrutham- Vedas' : If WE BELEIVE THAT OUR GOAL IS \< universal welfare - सर्वे सन्तु *निरामयाः* \> What should be our insistence for the framework of Ayurveda Education? in India and Beyond ? What should be the National Education and Policy goal of Ayurveda - Vaidya Profession ? What is Ayurveda based Health ( and Spiritual) care which distances itself from Yoga- Samskrutham- Vedas?



We need to think to future beyond the backward looking limitation of \< a पूर्वपक्षी or उदासीन\>. That is called ' swa-Dharmamapi chaavekshya karma karaNeeyam>.



7. On \< Yogis never depend on such rasaayans. What is your impression on that?\> : Yogi's at the state pointed by you would be in Physio-Mental state called ' **Nitya-satwastha** ( Gita:2-45: traigunyavishayaa vedaa nistraigunyo bhavaarjuna \| nirdvandvo **nityasatvastho niryogakshemam aatmavaan** ) where their Swasthya maintenance does not need a \<rasaayana> supplement. A state where the ' Triguna' refinement has undergone to a highly refined state. The \<rasa- ayana> they are journeying is towards \<raso vai sah: the Brahma tattva>.



It is a phase of up-gradation of Ayur-veda from its UPA-VEDA status to the NEXT level of 'AYUSH used to Vision and Practice Veda and go
towards \< VEDANTA-VIJNANA SUNISHCHITAARTHAH, **SANNYASA YOGAAT YATAYAH SHUDDHA-SATTVAAH** \>. We are not there in this exchange of ideas.
