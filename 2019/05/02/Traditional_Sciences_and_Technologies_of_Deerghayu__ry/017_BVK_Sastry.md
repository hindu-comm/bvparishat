Namaste Prasadgaru



Before we go to limit the benefits of ayurveda as \< applying to we , Indians>, please think over the following points:



a) On \< an individual is an organic whole for the bio medical researchers, which is not the same here. \> Medicine Practice and research is not limited to bio-medical research. Charakas thinking comes in 'Vedic frame as Upa-Veda practice'; but the benefit of Ayurveda was not just limited to ' followers of 'Veda'. Buddhists and Jains have contributed extensively to Ayurveda. There are fundamental axiomatic differences between the Ayurveda and Hippocratic medicine system. But the goals are same or similar . So, please rethink how Ayurveda benefits on the theme of ' longevity' can be extended as a Global health care system than limiting ' Ayurveda as a Hindu Religion Medicine system' .



b) On \< They create 'technologies' to increase longevity, we do same with elixirs. \> The question asked diffrently would be : How may \< we, Indians> create technologies of 'rasayana' to increase longevity'? Are the current manufacturers/ prescribers of ' rasyanas' subject to any kind of review - standards - audit ? or they hide behind the \< secrecy of formulations> ? 



c) On \< Their study of epigenetics differ from our spatio-temporal, socio-cultural dimensions  \> Can we think beyond ' We- Theirs' paradigm and think of ' We the humans of current global society'? What will be the Indian model for taking care of senior aging people in current society ? Vanaprastha system has broken down because 'Gruhastha and Brahmacharya' phases have undergone drastic changes. Which also means the care available for children-health in family and society also has undergone changes. Please take a look at the attached paper ( from link : ) This paper elaborates the Ayurvedic perspective on preventive medicine in children, with specific reference to vaccination. It explores alternative approaches to boost immunity in children.



On close review: Much of current teaching and practices of Ayurveda has distanced out itself from the traditional Yoga, Jyotisha and Samskrutham ( not to speak of efforts to catch up with rational experimentation ' medical science of west'). Ayurveda practitioners have preferentially sided 'bottled Ayurveda' to keep good company with modern health care practitioners in the market; but shy away from the ' medical science research' which provides the spine for western medicine' ( even with all its limitation). I am one of you all in seeking good from Ayurveda and go global.)
