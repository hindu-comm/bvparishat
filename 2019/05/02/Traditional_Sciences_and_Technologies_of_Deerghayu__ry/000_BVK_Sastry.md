Namaste 



The traditional blessing from elders is ' deergha- ayushyamastu'- ' Chiram jeeva' - May you live a long life.



The question is how long is long ? Life expectancy based or as long as one desired to live (Shatam jeevema sharadah suveeraah) or life extended by rasaayanas ?



Here is an interesting article link for exploration. It would be interesting to see how scholars of different disciplines - ayurveda ,
Jyotish, Yoga would connect to explain the science and technology that makes this possible ? and connect it to the age of Mahabharta warriors, Dasharathas age at the time of Ramas abhishekha .....
