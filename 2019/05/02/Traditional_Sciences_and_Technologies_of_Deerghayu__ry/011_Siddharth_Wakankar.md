Sastryji,

  

I just mentioned that they lived a very good and healthy life and never said that their life was lengthened by rasayana etc.

  

I met two persons who crossed 100 years with normal life.One was the younger sister of my father.in.law and the other is the famous Pandit Shripad Damodar Satavalekar of Svadhyaya Mandal, Pardi, Gujarat,who had edited all the Vedas in the recent past.

  

Hope,am clear.I made no claim of longevity of life due to Rasayana treatment etc.
