सर्वेभ्यो विद्वद्भ्यो नमौनम:

Markaney puran quotes

जीवेद्वर्ष शतं साग्रं अपम्रित्यु विवर्जित:

shukla yaju says

शतं जीवेम शरद: शतं प्रब्रवाम शरद: शतम्

means in a general sense a hundred year healthy living is ideal,

Agreed that sages, Demi Gods, demons, yogis live many more years, we also should consider the norms of time calculation system, like संवत्सर, नक्षत्र वर्ष, चन्द्र वर्ष, सौर वर्ष etc, yet the yogijanas live many many years, we can't deny but in present time also a hundred year living with good health is itself a bless, isn't it? Regards,
