I second Dr Prasad when he says that young scholars of Ayurveda have very low degree if knowledge of Sanskrit nuances.

  

Many of them even do not understand Sanskrit as they learn through translations.

  

I was offered a job to teach Sanskrit to Lecturers in Ayurveda,which I could not accept.Their knowledge of Sanskrit is beyond our comprehension, still,they get degrees and distinctions.This is the pathetic situation.

  

Moreover,a retired Principal of Ayurvedic College,had never heard the name of Bhojanakutuhalam and he was heading an Ayurvedic College run by a Swami in Karnataka.

  

Less said is better,more said is worst.
