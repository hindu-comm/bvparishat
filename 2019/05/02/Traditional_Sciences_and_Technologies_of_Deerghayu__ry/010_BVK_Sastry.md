Namaste



Am I missing something in this post ? - on ' Prajnaaparaadha' - which may better map to the practical issue of ' conscious violation of prescribed guidelines for good life style and conduct' . Then it is a bundle of instructions and guidance where the practice stretches beyond general medicine to ' life style counseling, family medicine and many other wellness strategies for physical and mental well being'. One of the modern practices recommends practice of games like bridge ( dyuta- kreedaa- ?? )

**Bijoy Misra**: \< line for the physician to check the mental condition of the patient to determine a treatment \>

Which translates to
Ayurveda practitioners guideline to check the mental health of the patient.



**JSRA Prasad**: \< that theory is called प्रज्ञापराध (intellectual blasphemy), one of the three primordial factors of disease \> 

Which translates to Ayurvedic Physician adapting a ' Three Guna Examination' for ' Manas'. How is the combination of \< सद्वृत्त and आचाररसायन are the therapies to maintain a

clean mind.> to be connected with the ' Three Guna analysis'? Does Ayurveda practice have a ' systematized guideline for checking the Three Gunas ?



**Note**: Swastha vrutta, rutucharyaa provide several life style options which may not be to the total taste of ' conservative culture' models. Also, there are slackening conditions which need to be contextually applied, with the discretion of the ayurvedic physician.
