Teaching is modified only in some colleges/states, not all. Sanskrit component is not given serious attention in the syllabi. The bitter truth is, a young doctor with BAMS is not thorough in padaartha-vijnanam and original Sanskrit texts. This I could say with some personal observations.

  

What if I say, some gentlemen in the ministry of AYUSH (erstwhile part of MHFW), are responsible for decline of standards in Ayurveda. Yes, we dig our own grave. Details can't be shared in public forums, so I restrain myself.

  

However, one should not forget Kerala, Karnataka, Maharashtra kind of fortes of Ayurvedic teaching and research which give hopes for future Ayurveda.  

  

Ayurveda coupled with knowledge of Jyotisha is gaining momentum in the name of 'Medical Astrology' these days. Much before anyone spoke of 'interdisciplinary studies,' we use to have such approach till the Macaulay system demolished the ancient Gurukula system.

With my limited exposure in this subject, I'd like to submit for your consideration the following.

  

Approach to drug discovery is totally different in bio medicine. They concentrate more on 'active principle' than the whole drug. When one takes a pain killer continuously, it 'subsides' the disease and triggers a side effect in one's kidneys. Whereas this does not happen in Ayurveda as they consider the whole drug (पञ्चाङ्गम्) in stead of isolating an active principle (which, later, would be patented for 20 years).

  

Rauvolfia serpintina (सर्पगन्धा) is highly efficient in psychological disorders. Sometime back, Bio medical researchers wanted to market it and isolated it's active ingredient by doing clinical trails; only to derive strange adverse effects. So, let's recall the most appropriate axiom 'प्रयोगः शमयेद्व्याधिं...'

80% of Ayurvedic practioners depend on ready made pharmacy drugs, they won't prepare on their own, due to several reasons. Remaining 20% only have their own herbal cultivations in places like Kerala. As per the maxim, स्थालीपुलाकन्याय, I offered the Serpentina example for your impression on '..spine of Western medicine.'

  

For the past couple of years, 'Reverse Pharmacology' is becoming popular in Ayurveda too. One can't ignore this reality, on par with bio medical research. Government need to revamp some important health policies to remove apprehension on our traditional medical practices. Mental health research is such a big domain, for instance.

  

In spite of so many socio-cultural variations, are not we the people who said आ नो भद्राः क्रतवो यन्तु विश्वतः?

  

I humbly submit that any Ayurveda expert of the forum, may add to/correct my justifications, if they are not fit in this discussion.

  

Regards,

Prasad
