Namaste



Specifically focusing the issues:



**Wakankar ji**: On \<Very true and experienced by persons of older generation \> Do we have living examples - 100 years and young with body fitness ? The current medical science does distinguish the birth based aging and body-matter aging by functions and performance.



What I have heard from elders is that ' rasayanas' help to keep the vigor and resistance to common health problems of old age; but increasing longevity by the claims is a question mark issue. Could you please help with specifics of ' rasayana' taking senior people with increased life expectancy / longevity ? It would help many research teams on geriatrics and aging seniors. Again the concept of 'ajaram'- beating the aging process, reversing the aging process' - is a claim that needs significant research justification .



Just to go back to Gita, (7-29 ) we see the talk of ' jaraa-marana- mokshaaya' :: to overcome the challenges of aging, old age, death and final liberation ..... . But the commentators go to revel on 'Moksha' leaving behind the issue of ' overcoming the focus on mundane ' jaraa'.
Probably ' vruddhatva' presented by aging body and grey hair is a minor worry of realized souls !



Going by faith is one issue; but getting to scientific validation of texts of tradition is a different dimension where understanding and implementing the text based directive needs specificities.



**Savita Sajjan Ji:** \< अस्य प्रयोगाद्वर्षशतमजरं वयस्तिष्ठतीति \>
and \< बृहत्फलाढ्यमारुह्य द्रुमं शाखागतं फलम्\| गृहीत्वा पाणिना तिष्ठेज्जपन् ब्रह्मामृतागमात्\|\|११\|\| >

Here you are bringing in the text . That is fine. The ' Procedure' by literal translation of text is not enough to arrive at a practical prescription. Where is the ' japa to be done'? Is one supposed to get down from the tree after \< गृहीत्वा\> or do the japa on the tree ? Because many Ayurveda esoteric practitioners feel that the vanaspati needs to be on the tree and live-connected with root and the japa-timing needs to be set by jyotisha ??

The ' technicality of - 'japan - brahma-amrutaagamaat' is not enough to pin down the practice by text; the concept of 'amrutha' (Elixir/ nectar of life) is an axiom for modern medical sciences ( if not taboo witchcraft recipes) .



Request more clarifications on the above point, if Ayurveda has to go any further in the area of geriatrics and 'Anti-Aging Research' programs.
