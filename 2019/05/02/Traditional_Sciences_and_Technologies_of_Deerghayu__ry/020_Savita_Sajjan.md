Namaste sir,

  

  Yes sir, I agree with all points regarding syllabus curriculum, dependency on Pharmaceutical industries, and not concentrating on proper/appropriate methodology as mentioned in classical text books.

        With my teaching experience, I want to discuss about Sanskrit and Padartha vijnana subjects.

 1) Student enters BAMS with science background, for them it becomes very difficult to study sanskrit grammer, its application to samhitas.
however some students learn but sanskrit grammar is not followed in 2nd ,3rd 4th Year of BAMS.

2)Padartha vijnana- Similar points will be studied in Astnga hrudaya , Charaka Samhita. Ex-Panchamahabhoot concept explained in dravyadi vijnaneeya adhyaya of astanga hruadaya- so it becomes repetition also for students .

 Some revision in syllabus needed or whether it is very essential for BAMS students to study padartha vijnana or not.
