Namaste sir

मनोऽर्थाव्यभिचरणेन,- This reference is from trividha roga vishesha vijnaneeya adhyaya - i.e trividha roga pareeksha (aptopadesha-pratyaksha and Anumana). Ref Cha Vim 5/8

  

 Little bit correction I have done, in your sentence, sir.

  The above-mentioned sentence is part of Trividha roga परीक्षा in which अनुमानप्रमाण would be employed to determine the mental status of a patient.
