Sastry garu,

  

Firstly, the article, that you referred, started with stories from western mythology and extended to literary imagination on immortality and longevity. Rather it emphasized on longevity than the other. It is nicely presented with some good statistical information.

  

But, this does not apply to we Indians. Their study of epigenetics differ from our spatio-temporal, socio-cultural dimensions. Because, an individual is an organic whole for the bio medical researchers, which is not the same here. They create 'technologies' to increase longevity, we do same with elixirs.

1. \<Do we have living examples - 100 years and young with body fitness ?>

Yes we do have. In Bangalore there is one scholar. In Andhra, we use to have a couple of them. In Tamilnadu, there is the 'Kaaya-kalpa' tradition, equivalentto Rasaayana method. Still there are many Yogis in and around places like Tiruvannamalai. Sri [Vethathiri maharishi](https://vethathiri.edu.in/maharishi/) is a living example. \<but increasing longevity by the claims is a question mark issue.> All that depends on which Ayurvedic doctor is approached. Alternatively, we can have a case-controlled study group aiming at using Chyavanaprash. Indeed, it is not meant for all they say in advertisements.

  

2. \<Gita, (7-29 ) we see the talk of ' jaraa-marana- mokshaaya'> Jaraa itself is a roga as they say in Ayurveda. As you also felt, they are concerned more about rooting out the permanent cause - janma, than suggesting remedial measures temporary causes. Why a part of prasthaana-traya would speak on behalf of vaidyakeeya. However, if it does, nothing wrong too.  

  

3\. \<Going by faith is one issue; but getting to scientific validation of texts of tradition is a different dimension where understanding and implementing the text based directive needs specificities.> If this is the anxiety of modern people, then let them discuss and come back on this wisest quote of Caraka referring to common drug side effects -

  

प्रयोगः शमयेद्व्याधिं योऽन्यमन्यमुदीरयेत् ।

नासौ विशुद्धः शुद्धस्तु शमयेद्यो न कोपयेत् ।।

  

4\. \<The ' Procedure' by literal translation of text is not enough to
arrive at a practical prescription.> Here, they talk about दैवव्यपाश्रयचिकित्सा which is not mandatory to all. This is endorsed in modern system to be known as faith healing.

  

5\. \<Where is the ' japa to be done'? Is one supposed to get down from the tree after \< गृहीत्वा> or do the japa on the tree ?> Here is the translation done by a group of reliable scholars on the part provided Savita ji:

  

"*At end of the year, he should fast for three days and then should enter in to a forest of amalaki trees on full moon day of the month of Pausha, Magha or Phalguna. Then he should climb on one of the amalaki trees having big fruits, *should take the fruit situated on a branch by hand and should wait for some time repeating the Brahman mantras till nectar descends in the frui***t*." I think, rest of your comments can becleared by this reference.

  

More in next communication.

  

Thanks!
