Namaste Paturi garu



A medical Professional does not need a course with an intention for 'language scholarship for literature study using grammar rules for literature appreciation'.



The Ayurveda medical professionals need Sanskrit technical language tools to facilitate 'Samskruth as a Technical Language to document -deliberate Ayurveda diagnostics'.



Probably this was the focus of some of the points in Tantra- yukti chapter.



Just as Western medicine doctors needed a technical medical vocabulary ( and so, studied Latin, French), for case study documentation, discussion and research, the need of Samskrutham for Vaidya was perceived. The understanding of the text of tradition in native language is an intermediary step before commencement of practice.



***Question***: Did the Sanskrit education courses for Ayurveda achieved this goal? envisaged this requirement? Were the courses designed to achieve this and taught for this goal? Has anyone made a follow up post academic study of Sanskrit usage in Ayurveda Patient record documentation ?



Are we the people to address this challenge and push action or we are just to lament and wait for someone else to act ?
