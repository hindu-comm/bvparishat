Namaste Sastry garu,

  

I think, you have mistaken my comment in toto. Let me please detail the same..

That is why I used the nomenclature - 'spatio-temporal' and 'socio-cultural' which Ayurveda actually mean to speak of देहदेश and भूमिदेश, and not as you understood. Constitutional changes occur from region to region and continent to continent. Same principles can not be applied everywhere. That is what I said 'Their study of epigenetics differ from our..' and so on. Essentially, we talk here about the 'personalistic medicine' than 'disease-centric medicine.'

  

Potency of a herb would be diminishing in other regions, compared to its point of origin. Imagine their impact during inter-continental export/import (could not recall the quote from Caraka). Also, desa is 3 types - arid, marshy and mixed. Accordingly, food and medicine differ. How can we compare all these between east and west.

  

Commit no mistake by saying that goals of Hippocratic and Ayurveda are similar. Prior to Hippocrates, it was believed that witches and sorcerers are cause of diseases. Hippocratic system initially believed that blood letting is the only way to get rid of disease, as blood is the substratum of all illnesses.

  

For a bad sore throat, America's first president, George Washington (?) advised by his doctor to let out 7 pints of blood, in less than 16 hours. Next day, because of excessive blood letting, he has not seen the sun forever. Until Louis Pasteur's Germ Theory, Hippocratic 4 humeral theory was prevalent. Later, it kept on extending and adding new theories to its fold, on disease etiology, like infectious, nutritional, genetic diseases etc.

  

Until 1947, the 'spiritual health' is not part of WHO's health definition. Let me emphasize that I do not talk about any sort of western indology here. So, there is no question of 'we' 'they kind of arguments.

As I am not a doctor to answer this query, some general awareness provokes me to respond. Most of the Ayurvedic pharmacy is business oriented. Spurious drugs are available in market. I am no authority to comment on why the U.S. banned imported drugs of mercury ingredients. Indeed, I've a different question. Are not we deviating from the 4 highest goals of human existence, when we indulge in talking about increasing longevity?

By now, it must have been clear, the purport of my comment. We believe in universal welfare - सर्वे सन्तु *निरामयाः*than living in our cocoons and thinking like 'we,' 'they.'

Thanks, certainly I'll go through it!

May I request you to please elaborate more. I'm sorry but they look more like sweeping statements.

Sir, you may make your stand clear; as a पूर्वपक्षी or उदासीन ।

  

Yogis never depend on such rasaayans. What is your impression on that?
