Dear Vidvans,

  

'Wink before you see and think before you speak' This dictum has gone out of vogue. What is the result?

  

The result is my way of pronouncing a given letter or word is the gold standard. An egoistic approach towards language. This attitude is not only to be found in people speaking vernacular languages but is also to be found in people speaking Sanskrit.

  

The important aspect that I experienced is that a person who cannot voice a letter does not hear it. For example a Sri Lankan cannot voice र. What happens? The Sri Lankan substitutes ल in its place. Why did the word धर्म get replaced by धम्म in prakrit where र is replaced by म.

  

Thus merely having a ear or an eye does not make a man fit to hear or see just as merely having a voice organ does make a person eligible to phonate a letter in a desired way. It is here that Shiksha plays an important part while teaching Sanskrit. That a person be capable of voicing Sanskrit words in a desiredmanner Panini has composed the Maheshwar Sutras. This statement of Patanjali in the first anhik of the first chapter of the Mahabhashya is conveniently ignored by saying we speak Sanskrit and so we know how each letter of the Sanskrit Language is voiced. Thus an egoistic attitude towards Sanskrit speech has ruined the chastity of the Sanskrit language and in the course of history the symbolic form of a letter (script) has replaced actual speech. It is this discounting of actual speech by its written symbolic form that has made it possible for modern Sanskrit Grammarians to twist and turn Paninian rules in a way, that a student feels that Paninian Grammar itself is one of the way of describing Sanskrit and not the only one.
Subsequently people like Bhandarkar further helped debase the Sanskrit language by bringing it into a format suitable for the West.

  

This is what the Western Sanskrit Grammarian exploits. Once the soul has been extinguished by converting it into script it is childs play.
It is like a cadaver on the postmortem table.

  

How can this process and method in any way help us to protect and preserve Sanskrit the way it needs to be protected. Here is how the Western Grammarian responds. Where is there any kind of chromatic uniformity in those who speak Sanskrit in India? Or there are a hundred shakhas of the way the Rig Veda is rendered. The same as was argued in another thread that there are a number of recensions and interpretations of our Scriptures in India itself. The Westerner says ours is just another.

  

It is high time that Indologist in India address this issue and remedy it once for all.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
