Dear Vidvans,

  

Why does the phonation of a word undergo change from region to region?

  

The main reason is the corruption of the vowel. A corrupted vowel not only affects the following consonant by forcing it to change its place of phonation but also affects the consonant to which the vowel is suffixed.

  

Why so?

  

It is because of the difference in the nature of effort invested to phonate a vowel and a consonant.

  

What is the difference?

  

A vowel is defined by the mudra (the volume as well as the shape of the oral cavity) a vowel takes while being voiced whereas consonants are defined by the place of constriction of the flow of air and the shape the tongue takes to constrict the flow.

  

A change in the mudra while phonating a vowel therefore puts constraints on the ability of the following consonant to take its natural place. As a result one observes that the word endings of the word appear changed when one moves from one regional language. At the same time a language has inertia meaning there is anticipation of the following syllables in speech. For a unique frame of vowel phonation the physiology of the vocal tract prempts the word to take a particular form. It is on this basis that we distinguish one language from another.

  

Thus we can say that we can define the uniqueness of a languge by the degree of skewness of vowels from their natural one.

  

The question then is what is the nature of phonation of unskewed vowels?

  

This can be defined by the mudra that the face takes while voicing the अच vowels of the Maheshwar Sutras.

  

Why so?

  

It is because we find in India that though all Indian languages have the same vowel structure individuals of each regional language voice the अच vowels differently. The same अ is voiced in one way in UP in another way in Bihar and in still another way in Bengal, a fourth way in Maharashtra and so on in various North and South Indian Languages. Thus the contemporary voicing of a vowel in any Indian language cannot be the basis of determining the true nature of voicing of a vowel.

  

Why are they voiced differently in different Indian regional languages?

  

That is because of the sequence used to teach the vowels, namely अ आ इ ई ,etc.

  

It is also for this reason that all lingual defects are classified as vowel defects which together have been called संवृत defects in the Mahabhashya.

  

It is therefore necessary that phonation of vowels at least for Sanskrit be standarised by taking the voicing of the Maheshwar Sutras as the standard. It is only then that we can describe the uniqueness of each of the Indian regional languages. A task which till date has not been taken to hand. Else each of the regional language will appear as different languages with different origins.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
