Namaste Achyut Karve



Good points and effort to present a coherent logic behind organization of ' varna-maalaa' of ' bharateeya- brahmi- bhashaa samooha (Cluster of Brahmi Indic language family). See highlighted points in the thread of post below.



On \< nature of effort invested to phonate a vowel and a consonant \> :
This is the technicality of \<sthana-prayatna> and \< savarna = similarity of phoneme unit that surfaces as fittest in the Sandhi
effort'. This technicality which causes generation of clusters of
\<combinations, corruptions, improvisations, intentional modifications of svara-sandhi = vowel combine> has its physiological, neurological, esoteric implications. The full study of this is not revealed or detailed in Samskruth documented texts. **This belongs to esoteric teaching part of Mantra-(Vak-Yoga)-Shaastra/ Veda study ( Veda is also called Mantra) and Music ( gaana / sammgeeta/ saama / geetikaa).**



In the context of language variations, it is another dimension on how \<svara -sandhi> output rules are presented in grammars of Prakrit and desi languages. Again a indic linguistic study area not explored properly in research. 



Contra, inappropriate phonetics of english language is superimposed in phonating Samskruth (- and effort is otherwise called Standards of Romanization of Devanagari Script, which Computational technologists and Voice researchers are passionately working at ! ) . This study is not an issue of 'Font- Glyph- rendering'; it is NOT cutting segments of Voice wave -signal and reconstructing it ! It is an issue of presenting a unique visual symbol for the unique sound of human phonation as used in language.



If we are used to accept implicitly the current devanagari visual script as standard guide for phonation of vowels, to be same across all indic brahmi languages ( just for limited consideration), it would be interesting to explore : Why the same ' svara' sounds with same symbols get pronounced differently in different regions with language tags ?? who is responsible for this ?? If \<Samskruth and Prakruths: say Marathi and Gujrati ; Telugu and Kannada \> are taught with the help of same \< अ आ इ ई > symbols for vowels, would the pronunciation be same ? If so/ If not WHY ? This is pointed finding of serious significant research issue in Brahmi Indian language studies and teaching: The teaching of \< phonemic association for the visual symbols अ आ इ ई
always came with the CLEAR TAG FOR PHONATION: If Samskruth , phonate like this; If specific PRAKRIT, then PHONATE LIKE THIS.> This Samskruth- Prakrit Phonation difference for the same symbol by LANGUAGE TAG is LOST in teaching of Languages at Schools as well as Research.
The ground reality is that the difference lost in the teaching of ' VARNA-MAALAA' continues to live and stare at us in the WORD-SENTENCE- LITERATURE level. The same string of Devanagari text , when phonated with Samskruth language tag in south, sounds differently than the same string phonated with ' Martahi/ Gujrati/ Telugu/ Tamil/ Kannada Language Tag. The difference is clearly perceived by the trained ear.



The outcome of this ' Samskrut -Prakrit- Phonation differential' has a high degree impact in 'Mantra Yoga Practice' and fruits one gets out of it. It is more than teaching by a consideration of one Guru in south or north region. It is a question of identifying what language tag is used to phonate a given text of tradition in practice . In other words , even though the script symbol may be look alike, Brahmi Samskruth Vowel phonation is NOT the same as Brahmi-Prakrit Vowel phonation. This ' INTERNAL SHIFTS IN PHONATION OF SVARAS' across Brahmi languages ( and its derivative Indian National languages is a VOICE REALITY. It is NOT dealt so in Language Teaching or Technology deliberation. Much worse is the equation (Roman alphabet a A- i I
sequence = Devanagari अ आ इ ई sequence) for phonation equivalence.



This precisely was the point made by Indian Grammarians of Samskruth and Prakrit in according different ' PRAKRIT' language identities . The grammarians observed the phonation shifts and provided rule base to connect back to ' SAMSKRUT /BHASHAA from PRAKRIT Or Make Prakrit of specific variety from Samskruth Bhashaa. They kept 'accented Sanskrit'- CHANDAS out of this deliberation! The Prakrit grammars ( fourteen or more, particularly Hemachandra suri) make explicit and loud statements on this issue. The meaning of ' Samskruth is the mother of Prakrits' - is to show how many regional variations have occurred in the journey of Samskruth in Indian user communities at different regions; How Prakrits kept their bi-directional Standards - one connecting to source: Samskruth Bhashaa ; other Cross connection from one Prakrit to another Prakrit and recognizing the Prakrit degeneration itself.



I strongly feel that this analytics, which existed in Samskruth- Prakrit relational studies, based on 'Regional Variation in phonation of Samskruth Varnamaalaa' was vitiated in colonial linguistics and indology ( not necessary to go to reasons). And now there are passionate Indological institutions of Prakrit studies in India ( heavily funded by community and government) to paint a new picture \< Prakrit can be studied with Prakrit itself ; Prakrit is the mother of Samskruth Bhashaa (Chandas is a panegyric singing variation of Bhashaa ?!). The sensitivities of communities and scholars in this area carry a high flash point on egos and authorities ! and self perceived/ projected
understanding of history- footprints of languages.



This applies even to the way ' Maharashtrian language, described in tradition as ' Prakrushtam Prakritam' ; Gujrati as ' Goorjari Prakrit !
This point would be interesting if you observe that Prakrit is differentiated and given a separate identity by region ; BUT there was no such division as ' Gujrathi/ Marathi / Kashmiri/ Punjabi Samskruth.
It was just one Paninian Samskrutham. There is much to uncover to understand bharateeya-bhashaa vyakarana paramparaa !
