It is the transcription of the name of the very recent cyclone that made me write this small note. I see the name spelt in English newspapers as "Fani" but in many regional language newspapers I see it as fōnī or fōni, fānī or fāni and even fēnī or fēni (फ़ोनी, फ़ानी, फ़ेनी, ഫാനി, ഫോനി, ഫേനി, ಫೋನಿ, ಫಾನಿ, ಪೇನಿ, ఫోని, ఫాని, ఫేని, ஃபோனி, ஃபானி, ஃபேனி). I couldn’t see a single regional language newspaper spell it as phaṇi (फणि).  Actually, the cyclone was named phaṇi (फणि ফণি) in Bengali by Bangla Desh. Phaṇi (फणि) in Bengali and most other Indian languages means a serpent. (That which has phaṇa – hood – is a phaṇi). In Bengali it is written as phaṇi but pronounced as phoṇi or foṇi. Sad that Indian language speakers are so ignorant of one another’s languages.

  

On another note, I think in many Indian languages there exists a confusion between the sounds f (फ़) and ph (फ). Before the spread of the influence of Persian/Urdu and English, most Indian languages did not have the sound "f". With the spread of the influence of Urdu and English, bonafide "ph" sound got replaced by "f" in the speech of the upper classes of city dwellers. Phala (fruit, result) became 'fala',
saphala (successful) became safala, and Praphulla became "Praful" or even Prafool, and so on. But even today, in the unsophisticated dialects of the villagers, "ph" sound is still retained. There is no “f” in their dialects. Even Persian/Urdu and English “f” becomes “ph”; “foreign” becomes “phoren”.
