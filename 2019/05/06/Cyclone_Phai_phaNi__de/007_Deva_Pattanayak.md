Odia is a phonetic language and Fani in Odia is pronounced as "phaNi". Of course when the cyclone travels to Bangla and Bangladesh it will be pronounced "phoNi"  
Fani has left many in the east coast of Odisha, particularly Puri and I request all to donate to charitable organizations helping the affected people. The Odisha government has to be commended to keep the death toll low.

( My ancestral village is Dadhimachhagadia, Khurda, Puri. I do not know how our house is affected. No telephone connection yet,)
