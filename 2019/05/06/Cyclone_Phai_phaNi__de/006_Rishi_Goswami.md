Namaste.  
  
I really wonder why we bharatians don't use any stress marks on our syllables like how the french or spanish use in daily usage as well.  
  
French names like Anné Marie or Spanish names like Pedró, all use certain stress marks to denote difference in pronounciation. If that happens, there would be no confusion to even a foriegner I think.  
  
This intrigues me why don't we add stress marks in our names as well?
