Dear Vidwans,

  

What is the difference between फणी and फणि?

  

The difference is that if one phonates the word फणि with a short इ, ण is not phonated retroflexively. In order that it be phonated retroflexively the vowel इ of ण needs to be lengthned. Therefore the word फणी is correct.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
