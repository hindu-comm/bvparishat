Prof Paturi,  

Resignation has no meaning! The universe is one set!  

Good debates should happen without bringing personalities into picture.

Sanskrit scholarship teaches how to make a point without sounding rude!

Passive voice (observation mode vs judgemental mode) would help.  

You have been an excellent moderator.
