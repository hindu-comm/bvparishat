Dear list members,



Not only can Roland not defend the “philology” of Grünendahl, Slaje, and Witzel, but when I posted a critique of their work to Indology list, these gentlemen themselves could not do so. Let us therefore stop invoking a questionable expertise.



Since Roland also mentioned “historical-critical philology” let me direct your attention to the table on pp. 259–61 of the article “Paradigm Lost” (<https://www.academia.edu/30431442/>), summarizing the results of “historical-critical philology” of the Bhagavadgītā. I welcome a discussion of how this philology in any way led to objective, reliable, and scientific results.



Roland’s opprobium at anti-Semitism is commendable. But if he wishes to be consistent, he must resign from not only this list but also Indology list in protest at Eli Franco’s hagiography, plagiarism, and cover-up of Hertel’s anti-Semitism (documented here: <https://www.academia.edu/38844141/>). At the very least, he should condemn Franco for it.



Finally, since philology is such an important and oft-evoked topic by German Indologists, we should have an honest and critical evaluation of the “historical-critical edition” of the Mokṣopāya on this list. I invite scholars to join me and Vishwa in our work on this edition. Please contact me off-list if you wish to contribute.
