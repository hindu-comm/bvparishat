Dear Sri Lokesh-ji,

  

What is wrong in saying that anti this or that, anti any community as a whole is bad.

  

You may have greater sympathies for a certain community and less for others. But to give justification for a certain anti in the haste of showing that greater sympathy for one community amounts to one of the antis, i.e., it amounts to anti-Brahmin and anti-Muslim.

  

please speak a little more carefully.
