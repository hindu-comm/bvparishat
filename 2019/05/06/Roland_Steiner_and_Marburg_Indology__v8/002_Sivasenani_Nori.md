I read the paper 'Jews and Hindus in Indology' and the main points of the paper immediately struck a chord. One could sense the alienation from tradition amongst the non-pandit Professors when reading their works, but it was foregrounded in the paper. The strain of 19th century European scholars to force new interpretations, and their lack of gratitude to traditional commentators, is very clear to even the beginner but this paper brings out the reasons and the forces at work very clearly. The indignation of these enlightened scholars and the blatant racism in their private correspondences (copiously evidenced in the footnotes - which I would say run to three times the length of the text) brings out the dishonesty of those Indologists and alerts readers to understand the agenda which coloured the work of those Indologists.

  

These papers are of high quality and deserve to be widely read.
