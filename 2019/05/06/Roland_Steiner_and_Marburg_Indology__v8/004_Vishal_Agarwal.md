I will state my judgement - Dr Bagchee and Dr Adluri have laid out their case very convincingly.

  

Perhaps that is why one of them was unceremoniously expelled from the Liverpool Indology list unceremoniously a few weeks back by the coterie of the 'old white boys club' as has been the case since the list was founded over two decades back. There is a constant hostile environment for those who are not a part of this club.
