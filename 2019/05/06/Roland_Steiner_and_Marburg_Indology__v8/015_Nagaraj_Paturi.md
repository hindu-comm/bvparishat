Dear Sri Achyut-ji,

  

The earlier topic/thread from where the present thread branched out was started by none other than you and I expect you to remember that it was focused on comparison between Jewish sacred books and the Vedas.

  

Sri Balasubramanian Ramakrishnan-ji's mention of the work of Profs Adluri and the Bagchee lead to a digression.

  

In any e-mail list, it is common to start a new thread to handle digressions.

  

Since there was nothing substantial found to getting added to the focus " Jewish sacred books and the Vedas" , the thread was closed..

  

But the present thread is focused on Dr Steiner's response to Sri Balasubramanian Ramakrishnan's post and the topic of the work of Profs Adluri and Bagchee brought into discussion through that conversation between Dr Steiner and Sri Balasubramanian Ramakrishnan.

  

Response from the learned members to the Prof. Bagchee's post initiating the present thread shows that the background of reading of Profs Adluri and Bagchee was needed for members to understand that conversation.
