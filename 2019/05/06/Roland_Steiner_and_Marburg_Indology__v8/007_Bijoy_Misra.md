Nothing wrong in tolerating views!

India tolerates all, so many India-bashers make India their home!

An "ism" is a political label, a view can be analytic, others may not agree.  

I am not defending any uncultivated comment, but antisemitic is as meaningless as anti-Brahmin or anti-Muslim.

A statement has only opinion value. That includes Dr Steiner's!

  

Let the list not go political. As I see the attacks were started by Dr Steiner himself!

All attacks must stop. Attacking the list or the moderator does not help.
