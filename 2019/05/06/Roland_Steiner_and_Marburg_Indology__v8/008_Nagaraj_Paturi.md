Prof. Misra,

  

Dr Steiner and Dr Bagchee are discussing a development on another list called 'Indology'. It is not about BVP list.

  

Dr Bagchee said that Dr Steiner not condemning the antismitism of Dr Eli Franco and asserting that this list tolerating antisemitist comment would lead to his unsubscribing to this list are inconsistent with each other. In course of saying that, Dr Bagchee said that Dr Steiner should have resigned from the Indology list. Dr Steiner did not respond about his not condemning about Dr Eli Franco's antisemitism. But said to the effect that since Dr Eli Franco's antisemitism was not expressed on the Indology list, asking him to resign from that list is not correct.
