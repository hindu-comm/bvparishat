Please. neither anti-Brahmin nor anti-Muslim enjoy any significant population support nor a long history of 2000 years and nor have they been subjected to a genocide of 2m people with a short span of few years.

What are we comparing here? An anti-Brahmin sentiment when they occupy all the corridors of power and access to the best educational institutions? That is not genetics or inherent superiority. Anti- Muslim may have some legs to stand on but there is a difference of several orders of magnitude. Till 150 years ago they commanded the ruling class and were upper crust of wealth. For at least for 700 years before that, they were the most important political force. Let us be fair and not compare molehill with a mountain.

  

This is just my opinion.
