Roland posted four articles to this list under the guise of “facts.”

We have already responded to all these articles, so let me first set the record straight.



-- Jürgen Hanneder (2011): Pretense and Prejudice, in: Indologica Taurinensia 37 (2011), pp. 123-137. With a "Supplement" by Michael Hahn (p. 136 f.).  
  

-- Reinhold Grünendahl (2012): History in the Making: On Sheldon Pollock’s “NS Indology” and Vishwa Adluri’s “Pride and Prejudice”, in: International Journal of Hindu Studies 16,2 (2012), pp. 189-257, DOI 10.1007/s11407-012-9115-1  
  
-- Eli Franco (2016): The Nay Science. A History of German Indology, by Vishwa Adluri and Joydeep Bagchee, South Asia: Journal of South Asian Studies, DOI: 10.1080/00856401.2016.1207281



-- Eli Franco (2017): On “Theses on Indology” by Vishwa Adluri and Joydeep Bagchee.



These issues have been addressed here: Vishwa Adluri and Joydeep Bagchee, ‘Theses on Indology’, <https://www.academia.edu/30584186>



Here:Vishwa Adluri and Joydeep Bagchee, “Jews and Hindus in Indology,”<https://www.academia.edu/30937643/>



And here:Vishwa Adluri and Joydeep Bagchee, “Adaptive Reuse: Eli Franco, Plagiarism, and the Chair of Indology at Leipzig University,” <https://www.academia.edu/38844141/>



Grünendahl makes a big pretense in “History on the Making” about “philology.”

But he himself has a tenuous understanding of textual criticism. We spent an entire chapter listing his mistakes. See Vishwa Adluri and Joydeep Bagchee,*Philology and Criticism: A Guide to Mahābhārata Textual Criticism*(London: Anthem, 2018), <https://www.academia.edu/36999444/>.



Roland also makes hyperbolic claims about “German philology.” But we show that his teacher Walter Slaje makes the same error as Grünendahl. See the section “The Argument from Expertise,” <https://www.academia.edu/37364902/>



See also the conclusion of*Philology and Criticism*for an analysis of Michael Witzel’s PhD dissertation.



Roland, rather than rehashing hagiographies of Indology as philology, please defend the work of these scholars. Can you show how their work measures up to philology? Grünendahl and Slaje think Sukthankar classified Mahābhārata manuscripts by script. We have shown that this idea is empirically false and a priori impossible. Let us please have a concrete debate about philological methods rather than use philology as a slogan.
