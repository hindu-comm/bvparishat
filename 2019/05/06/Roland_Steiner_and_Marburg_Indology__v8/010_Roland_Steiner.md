Thank you for this clarification, Professor Paturi.  
  
I would have preferred to refrain from sending further messages to this thread, but I regard this issue as too important. Thus, one last remark ***in order to avoid possible misunderstandings***:

  
  
\> Dr Eli Franco's antisemitism  
  

I do not accept that there is anything like "Dr Eli Franco's antisemitism". The assertion that Professor Franco subscribes or could subscribe to anti-Semitic "ideas" or resentments is simply grotesque. I realize that my statement will provoke further "comments". However, I am not going to respond to it.
