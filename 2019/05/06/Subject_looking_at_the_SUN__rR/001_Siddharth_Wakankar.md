I remember the late Prof.R.B.Athavale of Mumbai used to take Suryasnaana early in the morning( rising sun) as well as the setting sun till his last breath St the role age of 93 years.

  

It seems, Suryasnaana was a yogic practice.

  

A further explanation from the scholars of this practice will be highly appreciated.

  

Thanks and regards.  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
