Dear Prof Korada, Saadara PraNaam!

  

\>नेक्षेतोद्यन्तमादित्यम्(मनु.) - is discussed inशाबरभ्ष्यम्(पू मी)

The purpose of asking this question is-

It is ok to see towards rising and setting the sun because rays of the sun are traveling through long stretch of atmosphere. That filters out harmful ultraviolet radiation. In Midday. the stretch of atmosphere above our head is short. So it is not healthy for eyes look at the sun in 12 noon.

Thanks. N.R.Joshi
