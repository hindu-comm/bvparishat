To answer the question raised let us look at the drawing of the earth with it's atmosphere.

Imagine the sun is overhead during the noon time when the sun's rays travel vertically through the atmosphere equal to 30 km before falling on the body. At sun set or sunrise the rays travel a longer distance through the atmosphere which can be easily calculated using the fact that the squar eof the hypotenuse of a right triangle is equal to the sum of the squares of its sides. For our earth that horizontal distance is 620 km roughly twenty times more than the thickness of the atmosphere. Besides the particulate composition seen by the horizontal path (sunset or sunrise) is more dense than the vertical ray. Two things happen to sun light passing through the atmosphere. 1. It gets absorbed by the molecules and particles. 2. It gets scattered into all angles due to the light scattering from molecules and particles. The shorter wavelengths get scattered more than the longer wavelengths by a factor which is fourth power of the ratio of wavelengths! That is why the sky appears yellow , orange and red because the short wavelength of the sun light, violate,idigo and blue rays of the sunlight ( vibgyor)gets scattered and do not reach the observer. The water vapour plays an important role as wrll. It is quite complicated and in a way is also a measure of air pollution .

Hope this helps!

Can some body post the slokas describing why one should not see the sun directly in the daytime.
