I think,Shri Kulkarni of the BHISHMA Series also came to this conclusion in his book named, Adi Shankar,The Saviour of Hinduism.

  

His argument that Shankaracharya flourishing in the 8 th century and then criticising Buddhism when it had already disappeared from India was a bit untenable.

  

Scholars may look into this question more seriously.
