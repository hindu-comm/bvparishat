This survey seems to focus on the year (or range of years) of shaMkara's birth.

  

Regarding the jayanti observance, I have read else where ( I am unable to point to the source right away, though), that it was fixed as

"vaishAkha shukla panchami" based on the application of kaTapayAdi sAnkhya on the word "shaMkara".

  

Is this true? If so, when was this date arrived at and by whom?

  

Regards

prabhu
