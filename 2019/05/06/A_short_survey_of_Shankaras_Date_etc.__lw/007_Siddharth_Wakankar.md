Shri S.D. Kulkarni of Thane says that he had access to the Vanshavalis preserved in the Shankara.mathas and hence his conclusion regarding the date of Shankaracharya could be correct.Scholars may dispute or disprove it.I just mentioned that book which I read some where in early 1980s and I exactly dont remember the precise date which he has assigned to ADI Shankaracharya.
