Cambridge-published Tirthankar Roy's (2012) book "India in the World Economy â€“ From Antiquity to the Present" is presented, amongst other things, as:  
  
1. "global history written on India's terms,"  
2. covering a period "from Antiquity to the Present".  
  
The validity of these two claims is analysed in this [critique](https://www.academia.edu/37969487/Tirthankar_Roys_2012_India_in_the_World_Economy_From_Antiquity_to_the_Present_Two_observations).
