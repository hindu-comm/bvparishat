नमस्ते श्रीमन् देवनारायण-वर्य !

Your message provokes me to think on the following

\(1\) "force and field is synonymous with ..." The word 'field' beings to mind how magnetic field was demonstrated by our school teacher.

![image.png](https://groups.google.com/group/bvparishat/attach/1c53e54d4bc08/image.png?part=0.1&view=1)  

It comes to mind that आत्माis like that "magnetism", the "magnetism", which makes the iron filings - the particulate matter to align, to have a specific inter-relation with each other ! Magnetism has its influence all across its क्षेत्रम् "field" इदं शरीरं कौन्तेय क्षेत्रमित्यभिधीयते (गीता 13'1).

If we replace the magnet bar with a bar made in aluminum or bronze, there will be no "field"-effect on the iron filings. Replacement of matter by matter will not work. For field-effect, there has to be the आत्मा"the specific characteristics". आत्मा is not matter. It is "the specific characteristics".

OR

if the magnetism of the magnet bar gets demagnetized, it will no more be able to effect the iron filings to get aligned.

When the elephant's head was put on the slain body of Ganesha, all the myriad cells had to get aligned and get connected, and finally the configuration to get activated.
