The key phrase is "pasam atmanah". That is entangled atman. The verse 20 of chapter 10 of Gita says

  

aham åtmå gu∂åkeça sarva-bhütåçaya-sthita˙  
aham ådiç ca madhyaµ ca bhütånåm anta eva ca

  

Clearly this sloka says explicitly that atma resides within every "bhuta" ( physical material body).  

So there is an association of atma with the body and that atmas themselves are entangled( pasam atmanah). How the process of entanglement happened is probably very difficult to realize, but through deep meditation it is possible to realize that entanglement with "paramatma"( God). That will also explain how God controls all the bhutas.Also the feeling that some thing is going to happen to us. In Odia I remember a phrase:

" Daiba daudi manisha gai

 Jeniki tanai teniki jai"

Translated it means God is like a rope and man is like a cow, like a cow man follows the prescription of God.

Now whether atma is force/field/wave or very fine particle does not make any difference because of wave particle duality established in quantum theory.

The key question still to be answered is how atman gets entangled with other atmans and paramatma, for it is not necessary that atman be entangled to body, It resides in living bodies.

May be the shastras have differentiated differences between living and non-living, which I clearly remember I studied in elementary class in an elementary way without bringing in the element atma.
