Let me again alert not to confuse between "mental understanding" to "word understanding".

Physical description has its limitation. Be scientific in this respect dealing with philosophy.

This is where the west has failed miserably. "God" is not a man etc..
"Realization" is different than "expression".  

I am sorry to interrupt. There is a Harekrishna group who is into these wild theological arguments.

Let us be objective to philosophy and science here and use words with care, cultivation and discretion.
