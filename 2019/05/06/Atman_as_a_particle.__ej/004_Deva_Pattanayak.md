Dear Abhyankarji,

Thank you for your thoughts. Force or field is synonymous with the concept of particle by the concept of wave particle duality. established in quantum mechanics, I am trying to understand what you are saying which is that "Atma is like the FORCE of the pinch, which holds all the matter and energies together. When we die, the matter and their latent energies fritter away. "

It is ok to have differing opinions. I am going to follow up your comments,particularly understanding how Shiva brought back life to the new body of Lord Ganesh.

Thanks

Devanarayan
