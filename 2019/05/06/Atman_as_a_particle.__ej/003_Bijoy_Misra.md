Dear friends,

To deduce quantitative logic in philosophical ideas is a mistake in my opinion.

The quantity works for the terrestrial processes. The philosophy is cosmic,

it should be considered metaphysical or conceptual.

Many of the expressions are poetic metaphors, limited by local word use.

They should be meditated upon, than be literally analyzed.
