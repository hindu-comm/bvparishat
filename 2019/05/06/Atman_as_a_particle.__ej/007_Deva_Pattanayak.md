I came across this quotation of Swami Vivekananda

'There is a curiosity in this nation \[USA\], such as you meet with nowhere else. They want to know everything, and their women—they are the most advanced in the world. The average American woman is far more cultivated than the average American man. The men slave all their life for money, and the women snatch every opportunity to improve themselves. And they are a very kind-hearted, frank people."

Curiosity to know everything is the sankalpa that leads man from darkness to light.

in this thread we are discussing out of sheer curiosity what is the understanding of life in ancient Indian scriptures and how and if there is any relationship or complementarity between the understanding of life processes then and now with the advances that has taken place in science.

Whether it will lead anywhere, will depend on our curiosity and ability to advance the state of knowledge.

Keeping things simple and focused is the key to success. Defining the problem is important. It is said that when one clearly defines what one tries to do, the problem is half solved.

The attempt is to understand us. Who we are and how we function. Scientifically speaking we are the laboratory and we experience everything inside us. Obvious things are matter, energy, forces we experience and many other characteristicsof us, the living being.

Our forefathers have analyzed life,the biology, chemistry,philosophy of life and have expressed them in their way for others to follow.

As I wrote earlier attraction is a natural process between matter. The forces that play role here are the molecular forces whose origin are electromagneticand entropic. The question that has arisen in my mind is how to characterize"atman". By it I mean somethingdifferent than the particles and forces science is aware of now.

Interestingly all of us have it within our bodies at this time. It will stay there with us as long as we are alive. That itself is a proposition. By "Atman" I mean here an entity within myself. Obviously I can not see it or feel it as I am seeing my hand and feeling my heart beat. So it has to be "Sukhmati Sukhma". In what state does it exist inside me?. That is the curiosity and quest.

I am reading a lot of about the entanglement of particles and fields(forces) at small dimensions.

Entanglement differs from a bound state. Entangled particles can not be separated. Pasam atmanah meaning that atmas are entangled will clearly mean inseparability of atma from other atmas and hence the paramatma.

I have been trying to understand the meaning of the sanskrit word "Pasam". It is translated as entanglement. I like to know its meaning and usage in Sanskrit and how it differs from "bondage" which is attributed to somethingin a bound state, inside a potential well and not outside when the particle is free from the potential.

I have to stop now. Let our curiosity lead us ahead!
