नमस्ते श्रीमन् देवनारायण-पट्टनायक-वर्य !

  

My view is different. Let us say, we hold a number of threads in a pinch and release the pinch. What change happens to the threads or the fingers ? Nonewhatsoever!

The threads represent what different matter and energies we have in our body. Atma is like the FORCE of the pinch, which holds all the matter and energies together. When we die, the matter and their latent energies fritter away.

By Newton's second law of motion Force is mass x acceleration. When we die, the mass, along with its latent energies remains the same, though they fritter away in due course. What is importantly lost is "Acceleration", which is lost or it becomes zero. That acceleration is Atma !

Sanskrit word for death is निधनम्. Etymology of निधनम् seems to be from धातु निधन् See \<धनम् \[धन्-अच्\]\> Three significant meanings of \<धनम्\> are (1) Sound \<धन्\> when we die, all body-sound becomes zero. (2) Wealth - The most important wealth is our breath. At death all wealth becomes zero. (3)धनmeans the positive potential, opposite of ऋण. When we die, the potential becomes zero. All matter, especially at the atomic level gets attached to each other by virtue of their potentials, rather, by virtue of their potential differences.

At the point of death, at निधनम्, all three meanings of allधनम् are in full evidence.

Prominently, all potential-differences become zero. That is why all matter, all particulate matter fritters away, starts suffering decay. Insects, bacteria, et al start devouring at it. And the matter of the body of the dead can do nothing about it.

-   Words in Sanskrit are not accidental. It is not that somebody
    thought that let there be one common noun for death as निधनम्. Words
    are very thoughtfully coined. Maybe, coining words like this is not
    a matter of commonplace human intelligence. Maybe, it is superhuman.
    Hence संस्कृतम् is देववाणी. Excuse me for this digression.

Coming back to what Atma is, in केनोपनिषत् we have the opening questions - केनेषितं पतति प्रेषितं मनः \| केन प्राणः प्रथमः प्रैति युक्तः \|

Note, there is hypothesis in the questions, that there is प्रेषणा of मनः, also of प्राणः, rather, मनः, and प्राणः also need प्रेषणा. Who provides that प्रेषणा ? केनेषितं is hence the question !

Shiva put on on the slain body of गणेश, the head of an elephant. That was not enough. He had to still activate the 'configuration'. शिवhad to infuse the प्रथमः प्राणः So, one answer to the केनेषितंquestion of केनोपनिषत् is शिवेन !

  

That प्रेषणा cannot be particulate. It is immensely potent and it is my contention that it all works प्रैतिby potential differences.
