Scientific view of creation of human beings ( not life ) is universally thought to be a process of evolution over ages which is credited to Darwin and few others.

My view of creation that I am going to describe now is neither original nor substantive. The earth was a part of the sun and it along with nine other planets and many subplanets and meteorites and voluminous amount of particles of various size, shape and chemical composition moved around the sun when they were very hot and in gaseous state. Gradually they cooled down and gases became liquid and solid due to inherent forces that attract particles towards each other. Actually the smaller the particle the attractive forces are higher. It is easy to remove a flower from your body than a particle of fine powder which sticks on. Molecules which are essentially a combination of atoms have properties very different than its ingredients. Water forms when two hydrogen atoms combine with an oxygen atom. Once they form it is very difficult to take them apart. So as complex molecules form they have characteristics very different than the molecules or atoms that formed them. At some time they formed organisms leading to smaller to larger animals. Because the earth has more water bodies than land and because water provides a surface with contact to air that contains oxygen and hydrogen and nitrogen and illuminated by sun rays making it hotter during the day and reflected sun rays from the moon of lower intensity ( hence cooler) many processes like waves, currents, tides and rivers and lakes form due to the process of rain cycle. Water evaporates rises and cools and the water vapours condense to form rain drops which falls due to the force of gravity which is an attractive force that attracts massive objects towards each other even if not in contact. In short the complex "life forms" had a mechanism to reproduce themselves because of the very unique size,shape and molecular arrangement ( double helix structure of DNA, RNA etc). Every cell of a living being is a big system, tiny and larger particles carry on tasks to survive in harsh conditions. They used information and experience learned during their life times and pass it on to their progeny. The process of reproduction involves a sperm andan egg attracted to each other. Information and intelligence reside in particles making up the living being to do what is required. I am typing this article to all of youassisted by my brain and myrides of muscle cells as well as nerve cells.

I may conjecture that atman is a very very fine particle that is strongly attached to every cell of the body and is strongly entangled with parmatma and possibly weakly entangled with few other atmans. It contains in it everything we do(karma) to ourselves and to others. At death it gets detached from the bodyretaining only the essence and experiences while in consciousness state and the earlier entanglements with other atmans still not un_entangled and new entanglement states created in the present life. It has the propensity to be attached to new live forms which occurs in a definite way because of the entangled process that I do not know.

  

I came across the sloka

prasaṅgam ajaraṁ pāśam

ātmanaḥ kavayo viduḥ

sa eva sādhuṣu kṛto

mokṣa-dvāram apāvṛtam

It mentions entanglement of atmanah. I also found that  

"The size of the spirit soul is mentioned in the Śvetaśvatara Upanishad (5.9) to be the ten-thousandth part of the tip of the hair."  

  

Besides its size what other propertiesare mentioned about Atman in the shastras?
