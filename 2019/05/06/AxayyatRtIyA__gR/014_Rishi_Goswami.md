Namami Vidvan.  
  
The name Ajay and Akshay are very commonly used in both languages, Hindi and Sanskrit, I'm unaware of southern languages.  
  
Naasti Jayo Yasya/Yasmin Sa Ajayah.  
  
Similarly, NAsti Kshayo yasyAh sA akshayA. akshayA chAsau tritIyA sA akshaya-tritIyA iti vigrahAntaram na syAt? (Here there was some अच् usage to probably remove the टाप्?).  
  
On this day, I guess Akshayakumara, son of Brahma was born, Treta Yuga also started, and many more significant events occured.  
  
Personally, I'm more convinced with ShakyArtha because it gives aptness and clarity, impossible (ashakya) to decease (kshaya), that's why akshayya-tritiya seems more apt in usage.  
  
Still, the common usage may also be right, isn't it?  
  
Sorry if I missed a point above, I didn't totally get the अच् part, but I'll read properly 2-3 times and I'll understand it.  
  
क्षमस्व यदि काचित् अन्यथा वाग् उच्चारिता, मूढमतिम् किञ्चिद् बोधयतु विद्वन् \_/\\\_।  
  
नमामि।
