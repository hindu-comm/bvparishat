Pranams,

  

Nowadays, Akshayyatritiya is portrayed as the ideal day to buy gold, especially in commercial advts. But according the following article, our scriptures emphasise upavaasa, japa, yaga and dana on this day.  

  

<https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1123582445280825345.html>

  

Do any of our Puranas or Dharmasastras recommend or sanction acquisition of gold on Akshayyatritiya?

shankara
