***The B of ABC of Indian chronology: Dating Buddha's Parinirvāṇa, A critique of Heinz Bechert's echo chamber***



> **Abstract**:The parinirvāṇa of Gautama Buddha is a milestone of > singular consequence in Indic chronology, serving as the landmark for > dating most events which compose the timeline of our history. In this > paper, the authors use astronomical methods to comprehensively > compile, analyse, define constraints and determine the unique solution > which meets the criteria considered for the most probable year for the > death of Buddha. Subsequently, in light of recent archaeological > evidence, not only do we demonstrate how key archaeology-related > conclusions in Heinz Bechert edited '***When did the Buddha live?***' > are acutely less tenable in 2019, but also deduce and propose a > terminus ante quem for Buddha's death. Thereafter, in the philology > section, through critical synoptic analysis, we identify problematics > that, in our assessment, vitiate the so-called corrected long > chronology, short chronology and Bechert's proposal. We believe this > paper addresses a crucial void in the post-1995 literature pertaining > to Buddha's chronological epoch in being perhaps the first substantive > critical assessment of some aspects of the Bechert volume, from an > Indic lens, underpinned by a scientific approach. >

> > **Abstract**: Whether posited as an invasion by or migration of > Aryans, these variant forms—of an into-India hypothesis (supposed > movement into India around the second millennium BCE)—are underpinned > by one constant: the consequence that the earliest forms of Vedic > culture and Sanskrit are not indigenous to India. Written in 2017, > this paper examines, in three dimensions, whether such a hypothesis, > given its startling consequence to Indic history, can remain a > preserve of only one domain (linguistics) before demonstrating not > only an absence of proof for such a consequence, amongst other related > questions, in key Indic texts through a study of the terms ārya and > drāviḍa but also specific problematics in the development of this > hypothesis in historical linguistics. >

***Sarasvatī in the Mahābhārata - A Study***

> 
> > **Abstract:**The mammoth significance of the Mahābhārata to Indic > Chronology is readily seen in the copious scholarship dedicated not > only to examining its epoch but also in particular to dating of river > Sarasvatī. While there are several works studying Sarasvatī in the > earliest Sanskrit texts and drawing inferences and arguments from > textual evidence to address critical issues plaguing early Indic > chronology, a similar effort—to comprehensively document, from 89000+ > verses of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute (BORI) critical > edition of the Mahābhārata and analyse it in its context to draw > inferences that could be of relevance to early Indic chronology—forms > the crux of this paper. The authors’ work consists of a database of > 222 verses of Sarasvatī from the BORI critical edition of the > Mahābhārata. This database enables the study of the qualifiers > associated with the river, including vitality, an especially crucial > factor when considered with the geographical markers associated with > it, thus providing a framework against which contemporary scientific > research draws greater perspective. We particularly look at the verses > that indicate the vitality of the river in the light of scientific > evidence from fields including geology, geomorphology, geohydrology to > explore the possibility of a terminus ante quem for the textual > material. The authors believe that their database, when combined with > the parameter of geographical coordinates, fills an important place in > textual analysis of the epic with regards to the timeline of the > Sarasvatī itself, and by extension the chronology of the events of the > Mahābhārata. >
