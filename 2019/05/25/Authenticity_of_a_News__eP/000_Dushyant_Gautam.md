Dear members,

I received the below message from one of my friend via WhatsApp. He himself also not sure about the authenticity of this message.

Can anyone member help all of us regarding the authenticity of this message?

If this message is true then each of us can contribute little.

  

  

\*Sudharma\* is the only newspaper published in Sanskrit language. It is published from Mysuru, Karnataka since late 1970s.

  

It is now struggling for funds. It is in our own interest that we keep the Sanskrit language alive for future generations.

  

You can help by :

  

a\) Becoming a subscriber to the physical copy of the paper (It costs only Rs.400 per year!) and making your friends and relatives as subscribers

b\) Placing advertisements in the paper

c\) Donating money directly

  

Visit : <http://sudharmasanskritdaily.in/>

  

Please forward this message so that it can recieve the help that it requires badly.

  

Remember, \*DHARMO RAKSHATI RAKSHITAHA\*

  

Thanks & Regards  
  
Dushyant Gautam
