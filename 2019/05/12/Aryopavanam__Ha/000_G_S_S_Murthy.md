Respected Scholars,

"Aaryopavanam" is a composition of mine which has been published in the 1st issue of 41st year (2019) of "Arvaachinasamskrutam" brought out by Devavani Parishad, Delhi.

It is a string of independent verses, mostly "anyokti"s and several of them are lake-reflexions of Kannada proverbs. Being a work in progress, it is incomplete.

PDF of the poem is attached so that those interested may have a look.

Thanks and regards,

GSS Murthy
