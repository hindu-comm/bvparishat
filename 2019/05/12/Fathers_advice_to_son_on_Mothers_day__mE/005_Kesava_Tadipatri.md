Anandji,

  

Thank you for your understanding. Just want to elaborate a bit more.

  

I fully understand that it is satirical in nature. In fact there is special place for satires (प्रहसन) or caricature (विदूषण) in Sanskrit literature. I never implied that there is Mother’s day concept in SanAtana dharma. It is clear that you wanted to write something funny for modern Mother’s Day concept. But even so, there is no exemption from grammatical accuracy. व्यङ्ग्य भाषण is also quite present in Sanskrit literature. Sarcasm or सोत्प्रास and संतक्षण are also widely used in Sanskrit plays, etc. If Sarcasm was intended, then also धूम्रपानसदचारः प्रशम्सनीयः is sarcasm to be used by the father and धूम्रपानदुराचारः गर्हनीयः is sarcasm to be used by the son. Sarcasm has to be complete in a sentence rather than half way.

  

One prahasana emphasizing the need for the accurate grammar is -

  

यस्य षष्ठी चतुर्थी च

विहस्य च विहाय च।

अहं कथं द्वितीया स्यात्

द्वितीया स्यामहम् कथम्॥
