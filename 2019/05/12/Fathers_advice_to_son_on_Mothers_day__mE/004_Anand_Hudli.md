Keshavji,

  

Thank you for your suggestions. I would, however, like to clarify that the poem is intended to be satirical in nature, based on my observations of many modern day families both in India and abroad. We know that there is no such concept as "Mother's Day" within Sanatana Dharma. We respect and love our mothers every day, not just remember them and talk to them on a specific day of the year. The same respect for mothers is not present in modern day cultures, and unfortunately, this lack of respect has crept into many modern day families in India and Indian families living abroad. However, there is also a general awareness of Sanatana values, albeit only in theory but not in practice. The poem is intended to convey a caricature of this situation. The father attempts to impress upon his son to at least not cause mental pain to his mother on Mother's Day. Regarding your point aboutधूमपानदुराचारः, the word is used in sarcasm by the son. In sarcasm, the opposite of what is conveyed by the word is the intended meaning. Modern day children do use sarcasm while speaking to their parents. An alternative wording could beधूमपानसदाचारःप्रशंसनीयः.

  

Anand
