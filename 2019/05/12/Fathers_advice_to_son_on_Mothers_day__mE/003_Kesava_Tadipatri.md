Dear sir,

  

Very good attempt and by God’s grace, keep it up.

  

Since you asked for some suggestions, if you don’t mind, I would like to say the following.

  

Any poetry must have a spontaneous and amooth flow and there should not be any sign of groping for words. There should be some shabdAlankaras like anuprAsa or alliteration and some arthAlankAras like upamAlankAra or simile, if some peotic beauty is desired.

  

Any instruction should start with some words that draw the attention Also why should this instruction be only for son? Why not for daughter also?

  

If the father is instructing his offspring, why madhyama purusha (second person) usage “मातृदेवोऽसि”(You are mother goddess)?

  

“ब्रूयात्” is wishful thinking. “ब्रूहि” is better word, which is instruction. Thus “मा ब्रूहि” goes much better than “न ब्रूयात्।”.

  

Needless repetition can be avoided - like - “ददान्न दुःखं” and “मा भूत्तस्या मनःपीडा” are same.

  

If the son says that “smoking is praiseworthy”, why would he call it durAchAra? If father says it is durAchAra, then why would he say “prashamsanIya”. Thus these two wrods can not go together at all.

  

If they are father’s words, then something like “धूम्रपानदुराचारं दुःखदं रोगदायकं।”. If they are son or daughter’s words - “ धूम्रपानं सुखप्रायं त्राणदम् पार्षदो।पि मे।”.

  

मातॄणाम् सुदिन is a true translation for “Mother’s day”. More natural will be “”मातृस्मारकदिनम्।”. Further such good behavior is imperative not just on Mother’s day, but on all days. So, the word “स्मारक” signifies that the reminding happens on that day, but behavior is needed on all days.

  

For one who wants way-side foods, smoking and all kinds of things, where is the question of sannyAsa?

  

“जनन्यै” is in chaturthI vibhakti. It should be dvitIyA l- like जननीं. शालायां is in saptamI vibhakti. It should be in paMchamI vibhakti - शालायाः.

  

“तदा” is not proper as harsh words should never be spoken. so “कदापि” is proper. “तु” and “हि” are not just fillers, They are very significant and have to be used cautiously.

  

It can start like this -

  

(Note by splitting “वत्स + अद्य”, it applies to the son. By splitting “वत्सा + अद्य”, it can apply to the daughter.)

  

विहितं औषधप्रायम्

वत्साद्य वचनं शृणु

मातृसेवामहाभाग्यं

मा विसर्ज मनागपि

  

मातृदेवोभवेत्याखा

विश्रुतं वेदवाग्धनम्

मा मा मतुः मनःपीडा

कारको भव सर्वदा

  

कदापि तान् कटुन् शन्दान्

मा ब्रूहि मतिमान् भव

शाकानि वा गृहे अत्र

भोजनम् हरि भाजनम्

  

भाशणम् गृहजनेभ्यः

न मे रोचनदाकम्

धूम्रपानं सुखप्रायं

त्राणदम् पार्षदो।पि मे

  

निष्कासनोऽपि शालायाः

वंछितं मे सुखावहम्

उद्योगं मे अयोग्यं हि

यथेच्छवर्तनं भवेत्

  

इत्यादि वचनानीत्थं

मातरं प्रति मा वद

विवाहं विना सौख्यम्

सर्वदा पशुसन्निभम्

  

All the best,

Kesava Tadipatri
