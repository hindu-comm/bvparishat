There is equal chance for interpreting मातृदिनम् as the day of “Mother’s shrAddha day” as there is for interpreting मातृस्मारकदिनम् as “Death anniversary for mother”.

That springs from the fact that there is shrAddha process in our culture, which is absent in their culture. So, they have no issue to say Mother’s Day or Father’s Day.

  

When the vigraha vAkya is (with singular usage) मातुः दिनम् or मातुः स्मारकदिनम्, there is scope for such interpretation.

By making it plural and going with madhyamapadalopi like शाकप्रियः ब्राह्मणः शाकब्राह्मणः

one may say - मातॄणां प्रीतिस्मारकदिनम् मातृस्मारकदिनम्

Similarly, one may opt to mention the vigrahavAkya for मातृदिनम्.
