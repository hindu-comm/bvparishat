अङ्गवङ्गकलिङ्गेषु सौराष्ट्रमगधेषु च, तीर्थंं विना न गन्तव्यं पुनः संस्कारम् आचरेत्।  
  
This shloka is from some Smriti, I had read this in one Tika on a granth of Vallabhacharya.  
  
Maybe Mlecchadeshas are only those which have been listed down in Puranaadi granthas, it may not be geographically apt to translate Mlechha as "Non-Aryan Southern".  
  
There are Non-Mlechha places as well, which don't fall in Aryavarta, for eg, Brahmavarta. The place where Ganga and Yamuna flow, that UP area is Brahmavarta I suppose. Such Non-Aryan places would also be termed Mlechha Deshas in that way.
