Hare Krishna.  

  
\>\> I still don't understand why seemingly well-meaning people jump  
\>\> to check a dictionary. Let the text be read a number of times till  
\>\> the meaning reveals. Don't bother if it did not reveal. Let's not jump  
\>\> to a third-party support. Aid is OK, but rush is not OK.  
\>\> An humble request..  
  

Thankyou for these kind words. I am at error. To err is human. It just  
didn't click me that plural forms are running and thus prabhavah will  
mean as what Nagaraja ji has translated.  
  
I feel Prof. Nagaraj ji's translation is the most fitting. The correct  
reading seems to be mlecchaas-caaryaasca. This is more probable  
because the whole text is running without repeating the word  
"bhumipaah" which is to be added to all the plural words, as Nagaraj  
ji has done; otherwise if we take mlecch-aacaryaah reading, then  
question would arise why in case of mleccha it was required to use a  
word for leader or king while not for others.  
  
This makes mlecchaa and aaryaa two different categories, and rulers of  
both of them came. Then it comes that the verse doesn't comment on the  
criterion on which mleccha and arya are distinguished.  
  
It could be researched on who exactly is called an "arya." Our  
conclusion should not only be based on the use of technical word  
"aryavarta" to define who is arya. The word arya-varta means the place  
where the aryans live; it doesn't negate aryans living at other  
places. Medhatithi speaks of this in Manu samhita. If time permits I  
may bring a small document on this.  

  
Thankyou,  
Hari Guru Vaisnava das,  
damodara das
