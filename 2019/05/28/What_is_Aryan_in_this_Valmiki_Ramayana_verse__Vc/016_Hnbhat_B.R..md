From the glossम्लेच्छाचार्याः = म्लेच्छप्रभवः। Govindaraja.

  

Does it mean k.ings of mlecchas or mleccha kings by the word in theआचार्याः in the compoundम्लेच्छाचार्याः। Either म्लेच्छाणाम् आचार्याः or म्लेच्छाश्च आचार्याः splitted in both ways or म्लेच्छः आचार्यो येषां ते in bahuvrihi compound.

  

Howआचार्याः can be substituted by प्रभवः in the gloss? I could not understand. Hence this was my question.
