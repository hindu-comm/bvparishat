Hare Krishna.  

  
\>\> I don't understand how prabhava means influenced.  
  

Yes, you are right. I mistook it for the word prabhAvah.  
  
Prabhavah means origin etc. MW says--  
  
m. production , source , origin , cause of existence (as father  
or mother , also " the  
Creator ") , birthplace (often ifc. , with f(आ). , springing or  
rising or derived from ,  
belonging to) Up. Mn. MBh. &c  
  
So Mleccha-prabhava basically means connected to mleccha either by the  
medium of birth or association.  

  
  
\>\> Nageshabhatta clearly explains आर्या मध्यदेशवासिनः  
  

Yes, although Nagesha Bhatta explains it based on locality or  
residence, Govinda explains it differently as -- aryah  

dishaadheetvaadi praaptyaa shreshthaah == arya  
here means those who are superior because of being entrusted with for  

ruling particular directions.  
  
Thankyou for correction.  
Hari Guru Vaisnava das,  
Damodara das
