I have felt that there continued two groups of people : followers of the Vedic principles ऋत and non-followers अनृत  

We are only exposed to literature from the Vedic perspective. The group अनृत is possibly large and had their

own literature. My feeling has been that a human-centric faith system had developed empirically which later

became known as Jainism. The communication language of the group is प्राकृत, which is generic.  

वनशैलान्तवासिनःis another category with several subdivisions.

  

As I said this is a "feeling"  

  

The "race" interpretation is convenient and bogus. I am going through the texts  

of these arbitrary writings as I am studying the British period history lately.
