\>\> Govindacharya and Kataka read it as one word म्लेच्छाचार्याश्च = म्लेच्छप्रभव:.  
  
Yes, this seems to be the correct reading. Extra "s" may have come due  
to error. It makes sense as the word ca-anye is after this word.  
Usually ca-anye is used to continue the progression that is mentioned.  
For instance, Bhagavatam 2.4.18 -- ye anye ca paapaa. . .  
  
This then makes the meaning that all non-mleccha kings gathered from  
all four directions as well as mleccha influenced and others kings  
also gathered at Dasaratha's place.
