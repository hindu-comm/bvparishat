Dear Guru Sri Das,

There is no kindness or unkindness here. Just a suggestion.

We observe nature to understand, we don't find answers in a

book. If we can't understand we take help from someone who  

might have observed more. We struggle till we understand

or we give up if we get tired. What I am suggesting is that we

don't get into assumed understanding. The latter has been done

massively and might be still happening. People produce well

bound "books" with the assumptions. This process has continued

for two hundred years when others tried to "read" the Indian

scholarship and literature. What I appeal is that all scholars  

should reject assumptions and any suspect convenience.

We don't compete with anyone, we derive delight in discovering

the creativity of the precision literature.

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
