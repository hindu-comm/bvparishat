The problem Mr. Das didn't take the plural form prabhavah only looked for dictionary ignoring the plural form in the text म्लेच्छाचार्याश्च for which gloss is given. Even then the problem is not simplified. How the आचार्याः of mleccha-s are called the kings?

No. It is not substitue forम्लेच्छभूमिपाः. See my note above.

Considering this, the other reading mleccha-s and Arya-s seems to be better related to those living in mountains and forest regions in the next part of the sentence or independently?
