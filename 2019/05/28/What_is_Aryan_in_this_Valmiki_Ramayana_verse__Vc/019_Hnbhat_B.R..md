Dear Das,

  

My question itself you seem to have understood.

  

The question arose in Goindaraja's and Kataka commentaryम्लेच्छाचार्याश्च =म्लेच्छप्रभव: where the text reads differently . Firstly you took the gloss portion and translated theप्रभव portion only misunderstood as meaning influenced. And my pointing out, lookig into dictionary you found another meaning for it born etc. which was again corrected by Mr.Nagaraja by suggesting the correct meaning as kings for the wordप्रभव:in the context.

  

After that I drew the attention of both to the question which which I made clear in my last message. For the sake of clarity, I repeat my question again here. As you can see, there is no word aaryaaH in the reading of the text according to to both commentators, but but it is aacaaryaaH which both interpreted asप्रभव: in the gloss. My question was how the wordम्लेच्छाचार्याश्चis interpreted as above meaning the kings ofम्लेच्छ as seen from the explanationम्लेच्छप्रभव:. That means how the word aacaaryaaH is made to give the meaning the kings. This is the current question and there is no question of aaryaaaH now as the word is not in the text according to the commentator. Hope this is clear. As I know aacaarya does not give the meaning the king or prabhu.

  

Please read the commentary and the text it reads carefully before you translate.
