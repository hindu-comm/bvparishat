नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

How does one handle imagination?Like composing new material?  

Has it been analyzed?

                               ------ Vid Bijoy Misra

  

How a शब्द is produced ? Panini in his शिक्षा explains the process --

  

आत्मा बुद्ध्या समेत्यार्थन् मनो युङ्ते विवक्षया ।

मनः कायाग्निमाहन्ति स प्रेरयति मारुतम् ।।6

मारुतस्तूरसि चरन् मन्द्रं जनयति स्वरम् ।7

...................................................

सो’दीर्णो मूर्ध्न्यभिहतो वक्त्रमापद्य मारुतः ।

वर्णान् जनयते .....॥ 9

  

The अन्तरङ्गम् (inner mind) connects the ' things ' with बुद्धि and puts the मनस् ( mind ) on the job of a desire to speak --

the मनस् in turn hits the जठराग्नि (digestive fire) , which pushes the air - the air , while moving in the chest , generates the sound - the air moves up - touches the palate - reaches the mouth - and generates the वर्ण-s .

  

So before pronouncing a sentence the above exercise takes place - unless and until one has got an imagination the above exercise is not possible . Later , one may not pronounce a single word - but there will certainly be an imagination .

  

In व्याकरणम् - Patanjali ( कर्मणा यमभि प्रैति स सम्प्रदानम् , पा 1-2-32 ) explains as to how a person thinks , acts and gets the thing he wants --

  

इह य एष मनुष्यः प्रेक्षापूर्वकारी भवति । स बुद्ध्या तवत् कंचिदर्थं पश्यति , सन्दृष्टे प्रार्थना , प्रार्थनायाम् अध्यवसायः , अध्यवसाय आरम्भः ,आरंभे निर्वृत्तिः , निर्वृत्तौ फलावाप्तिः ।

  

A human being would first think about something and then proceeds -- initially he looks at a particular thing in his बुद्धि - imagination - then he would have the wish - decides to have it - then the initiative - followed by putting in the effort - finally the effort is fruitful , i e he gets it .

  

Cognition is not achieved at once but gradually --

  

शिशुपालवधम् - 1सर्गः - beginning ---

  

हरि , saw नारद - but not at once --

  

गतं तिरश्चीनमनूरुसारथेः प्रसिद्धमूर्ध्वज्वलनं हविर्भुजः ।

पतत्यधो धाम विसारि सर्वतः किमेतदित्याकुलमीक्षितं जनैः ॥

  

People (हरि included) were perplexed and stared -- Sun's transit is across (the sky) , it is popular that fire has got his flames upwards
--- but this thing , pervading in all directions , is falling down -- what is this ?

  

चयस्त्विषामित्यवधारितं पुरा ततश्शरीरीति विभाविताकृतिम् ।

विभुर्विभक्तावयवं पुमानिति क्रामादमुं नारद इत्यबोधि सः॥

  

Initially it was decided that it is a mass of light , then , some body with clear form , then a man with clear limbs , gradually Hari came to know that it is Narada .

  

Let me know what you think about imagination . So that we can quote from शास्त्र-s about the imagination right from a child and further - the cause of शब्द etc.
