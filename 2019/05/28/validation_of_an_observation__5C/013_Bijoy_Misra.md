Dear Prof Korada,

The last sentence in your post is interesting

One should not say - this is मानस ( happened due to thinking in the mind ) - so this cannot be a वाक्यम् ।

How does one handle imagination? Like composing new material?  

Has it been analyzed?  

Bijoy Misra  

  

Can we make a similar map for imagination?

Like
