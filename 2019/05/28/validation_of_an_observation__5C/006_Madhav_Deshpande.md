Dear Bijoy Ji,

  

  Thanks for sharing this interesting article. Your notion of "cognitive syllable" as a neurological arrangement that pre-plans the voice" reminds me of some article (which I cannot now trace) that described the efforts to convert neurological electrical signals into recognizable speech sounds for people with some speech disability. Such research would support your notion of cognitive syllable. With best regards,
