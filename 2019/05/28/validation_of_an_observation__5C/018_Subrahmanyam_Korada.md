नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

If neurologists and linguists collaborate in India with appropriate funding then a better understanding how humans think and act will emerge. In western literature on language theory, hardly one finds reference to Panini

  

                                   
           ------- Vid Deva Pattanayak

  

You are right -- but , to be frank , most Indians are not serious in their Research - I did not take up a single Project because there are no good students , who want to really learn / work - every six months we have to send a false report about the Progress - that we cannot do .Even many teachers do not have adequate knowledge in their fields - most , if not all , once selected as faculty do not touch any book - who to blame ?

  

So many such proposals are just utopian ideas.

  

I am ready to do my best -- we can offer material from 18 विद्यास्थानम्=s and explain .

  

If we want to know about मनस् - it is there in श्रुति ।

  

If we want to know as to what is इन्द्रियम् - we have to ask Panini . (इन्द्रः = आत्मा) ।

  

Language acquisition by a child and other nuances are best explained in वाक्यपदीयम् ।

' If air touches speech organs वर्ण-s are produced ' -- what is this ?

  

It is not a comprehensive education system .

  

Nasal means अनुनासिकवर्ण -- how ?

  

The less spoken about their Theories (Hypotheses ?) the better .

  

Presently Vid Bijoy Misra and their group are doing something meaningful and we do support them .
