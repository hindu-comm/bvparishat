If neurologists and linguists collaborate in India with appropriate funding then a better understanding how humans think and act will emerge. In western literature on language theory, hardly one finds reference to Panini. Bijoy Mishra and his group are working to bridge the eastern knowledge with that of the western. More effort is needed.
