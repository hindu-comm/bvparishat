Perception appears to be a large research topic for the grammarians and the academic scholars between 5th century until Ramanuja.

I don't know if a proper bibliography exists. I would need help in entering into this literature.

I am stuck with VakyapdIyam (took long time) and some Dandi and Bhamaha.

I also understand (presume) that there is massive Buddhist literature on the subject.

The research in the west is primitive in these areas.
