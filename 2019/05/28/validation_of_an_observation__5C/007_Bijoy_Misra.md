Madhavji,

There the assumption is that the word exists in the brain but lacks the expression capacity.

They try anatomical excitation.

Comprehension or the cognition (you arrive on Mars or get to the ocean floor) has to be beyond the memory recall function.

The scene has to be constructed and processed together. At this point the color, shape, size, smell, touch, sound, interaction -

come in play. A multidimensional concept blob may form (hypothetical).
This blob would have syllables in them

which we are calling "cognitive syllables". The blob likely would have a structure and we associate this structure to "rasa".

a totally improvised locally generated cosmological construct.

I am using more phrases which need elaborate description. We are struggling to create a model.

Best regards,

Bijoy
