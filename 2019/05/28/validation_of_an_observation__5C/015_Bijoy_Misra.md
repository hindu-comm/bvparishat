Prof Korada,

I love it. I have to study Patanjali (have not done).  

There are processes between imagination and articulation.

We are conceiving a process of neural segmentation and  

hypothesizing something we call "cognitive syllable".

I will try to study and seek guidance on the literature.

Best regards,

Bijoy
