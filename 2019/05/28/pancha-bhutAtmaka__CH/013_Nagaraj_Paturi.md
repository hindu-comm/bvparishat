ākāśa of panchbūtas is not the sky that we know was known to many modern Indian Indic intellectuals. That is why they were trying to borrow the word Ether /Aether itself borrowed into modern science discourse from the classical Greek literature, as a translation for
ākāśa.

  

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aether_(classical_element)>

  

What various ancient Indian knowledge systems meant by ākāśa can only be reconstructed through the various linkages such as guṇas, tanmātras etc. What it corresponds to, in contemporary parlance may not have an exact one on one mapping.
