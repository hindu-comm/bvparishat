Sri Krishna Kumar garu,

  

First, what I am NOT saying. When I say '*neither the rishi nor the scientist knows what matter or energy actually is'* -

1.  I am not trying to discredit the shastras by bringing in nihilism or
    sunyavada - these are perverted theories, 2.  I am not alluding to -  

-   either the perverted form of mayavada, which entails denying the
    reality of the world, a popular misunderstanding of Sankara's
    kevaladvaita -   or the actual mayavada position, which says the world is not what it
    appears to be

  

Now, what I am saying is this -  

  

Fundamental material reality (matter or energy, in scientific parlance, and (mula) prakrti, in Indian parlance) cannot be really, positively known. This is not because nothing exists, but because that which fundamentally exists cannot be fully, positively known. That which fundamentally exists cannot be positively known because of the nature of knowledge itself. Knowledge *in this situation* is essentially the cognition or perception of differences or similarities, and as such, *here*, the process of knowing can be understood as a process of comparison.

  

\[ Please note that I am not bringing in a full discussion of the deployable means of pramana here (pratyaksa, anumana, sabda/agama, upamana, arthapatti, anupalabdhi) - I am just trying to hit the essentials in a discussion about the nature of *positive* knowledge. There is a body of work from the West on positivism and *a priori* and *a posteriori* knowledge that are relevant here but cannot be discussed in full here because they make take the discussion to other areas. \]  

  

The fact that there is a fundamental A in existence can be perceived by us directly or inferred by us or somebody trustworthy can tell that to us, and we can definitely know that there is a fundamental A somewhere. But to fully know (fundamental)A means to know what A is like, and to achieve that we must find another fundamental, a B, as it were, somewhere, to which the A can referred to, compared with, and hope that the similarities or differences between A and B may give us an idea of A itself. (Since A is fundamental, it cannot be further sub-divided into subtler fundamentals; therefore, the contents of A, or its properties as such, cannot be the defining criterion of full description, we have to find another fundamental for reference.)

  

At the fundamental level of (mula) prakrti, there is nothing else to compare it with (except the purusa, a fundamental *unknowable* entity of a different kind) so we can never confidently state what prakrti actually is. At this level, the best we can do is state that prakrti is not purusa (another fundamental entity but NOT of the same type), and that statement gives us no *positive* idea about prakrti itself.

  

A fundamental entity *of a certain kind* cannot be known in relation to another entity like it because the former is fundamental - there is no other like it. That which exists in the same category as the fundamental of a certain kind would be but a derivative of said fundamental, and therefore cannot be recursively used to define said fundamental.

  

And so, a related point which I would want to be understood properly - when I brought in the "label" theory, I was referring to the knowing of one (tattva) from another (tattva) by way of knowing by class, knowing by differences in essential properties, *within a certain schema* and not by way of knowing positively.

  

Also, kindly note that all this discussion is in the context of vyakta prakrti only.

  

with kind regards

Harsha
