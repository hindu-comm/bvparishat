Namaskar to all,

  

A couple of quick points, since my prev post has been misunderstood by some -

  

1\. Tattvas are neither elements nor principles (isn't that the king of woozy words!) but a schema of categorization of mulaprakrti and its derivatives (arrived at through reasoning) which I call 'labels'.

  

1A. That there is an external reality (gross bhutas) is not gainsaid. What I am saying is that the label should not be taken to be what exists. Labels are indicators, they indicate what exists, they themselves are not what exists. What exists is a fundamentally unknowable something. The very term 'tattva' means "thatness", because that's the best we can do in designating something.

  

2\. The relation between panchabhutas and tanmatras is neither accidental nor partly relational - tanmatras are the very cause of the panchabhutas, and the indriyas are smack in the middle of this relation. We can perceive and cognize only 5 tanmatras hence the bhutas too are 5 in number. If we were, say, eels, we'd have an extra tanmatra of electromagnetism in our schema. And no, that would not change anything - the original schema still stands.  

  

3\. By 'objective' I mean a consciousness/self-denying approach, confining oneself to what is observed, without taking into regard the presence of the observer. By 'subjective' I mean a consciousness/self-affirming approach, wherein the self is brought in as a necessary component of every outlook. Essentially, science is at the level of senses, scriptures above them.

  

4\. The cosmic and the human-centric views are the obverse and reverse of the same coin. Hiranyagarbha and the atma(s) sandwich reality (bhutas and indriyas) amongst themselves. Subject-Object(s)-subject is how the observable universe is stacked

  

5\. Sri Bijoy's post is rambling and disjointed.

  

6\. The discussion on akasa is proceeding on correct lines.

  

  

kind regards

Harsha
