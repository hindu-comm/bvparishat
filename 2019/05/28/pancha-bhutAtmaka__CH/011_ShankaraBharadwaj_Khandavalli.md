"There cannot be a correlation between the concept of panchabhutas and the periodic table of chemistry or the models of the atomic/sub-atomic world of physics.

  

This is because our scriptures and modern science have different points of departure - science is objective, while our scriptures are subjective in their approach."

  

There is no correlation between the five primal elements and periodic table of elements because the elements are about primal physical principles while the periodic table is about chemical elements.  

  

It is however not because of science being objective and scriptures being subjective. Our knowledge is comprehensive and has all kinds of approaches, reference frames, acceptable modes of explanations, as they suit different subjects. Some involve enumerations (the way a chemical view enumerates elements or a cosmic view enumerates primal elements), some involve reduction and elimination, some involve deduction, some involve genetic explanation and so on.  

  

The pancabhUta notion comes more from cosmic than human-centered understanding of the world. That the macro-micro have resemblance and there is a mapping of tanmatras corresponding to the pancabhUtas to what the senses perceive does not necessarily indicate a subjective approach. The macranthropic and macrotherian models where the cosmos is represented as a human or animal form, are cosmic explanations and thus universal/objective.  

  

More importantly the cosmic model has theory of causation, involving legitimately a genetic explanation, in which the primal elements are derivatives/effects of subtler causes. It is much less subjective.
