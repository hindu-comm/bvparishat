There cannot be a correlation between the concept of panchabhutas and the periodic table of chemistry or the models of the atomic/sub-atomic world of physics.

  

This is because our scriptures and modern science have different points of departure - science is objective, while our scriptures are subjective in their approach.

  

Taking the human self as the frame of reference, the concept of the five panchabhutas has been devised to map the universe with reference to our five major sense-organs - our apertures of perception into the universe.

  

I believe that the above statement has no basis. Digitization of thoughts and concepts must have been an important milestone in the growth of ideas.  

Orthogonality and independence are important concepts. To my knowledge, the history of evolution of philosophical ideas in classification has not been

studied analytically. We cite numbers and then people dismiss them.
Most likely the dismissive attitude started with the new Indology through lack of

rigor. I would submit that all numbers do matter.

  

Talking about the numbers I am currently struck with the Jaina analysis of असंखेय and अनन्त. I am looking for original Jaina texts.   

In case anyone in the list is interested, you can join me in the search and analysis.
