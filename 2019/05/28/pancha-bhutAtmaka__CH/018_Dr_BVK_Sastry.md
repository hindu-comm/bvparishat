Namaste



**Side question** : What was the necessity for a term like ' रोदसी ', - a compound term ' - (whether it is Nyaya shaastra or Other discipline) - which demands a union of two different 'dravyas' ( matter- ?? ) :: Sky and Earth (??) to be deliberated together ?



***Note***: dyauH is used together with the term ' div', dik',
'antariksha' also in some other context. Any reasonable explanation ? Each term carries unique pointer principle in the technicality of Shaastra.
