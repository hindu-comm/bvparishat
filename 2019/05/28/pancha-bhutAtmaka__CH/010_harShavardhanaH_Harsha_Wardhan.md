There cannot be a correlation between the concept of panchabhutas and the periodic table of chemistry or the models of the atomic/sub-atomic world of physics.

  

This is because our scriptures and modern science have different points of departure - science is objective, while our scriptures are subjective in their approach.

  

Taking the human self as the frame of reference, the concept of the five panchabhutas has been devised to map the universe with reference to our five major sense-organs - our apertures of perception into the universe.

  

Whether it is scriptures or modern science, it is necessary to understand that neither our rishis nor our scientists are any the wiser about the truth about the nature of the universe.

  

Panchabhutas, the elements, matter, energy, etc - all these are, essentially, labels for reference. Neither the rishi nor the scientist knows what matter or energy actually is.
