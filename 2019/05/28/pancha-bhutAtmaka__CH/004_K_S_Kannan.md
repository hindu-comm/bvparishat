For some material that you may perchance find useful,

you may look into my

*Theoretical Foundations of Ayurveda* (2011 Bangalore, 486pp.),  

wherein you can find views (along with actual citations) of  

Annambhatta, Vishvanatha, Kapila,  

Vacaspati,, Yaska, Bhartrhari, Helaraja,  

Caraka, Sushruta, Patanjali, Kaiyata,  

(and even the Upanishadic view)

on Akasha (and other things).

(sorry no diacritics).
