I applaud Sri V. Subramanian for his detailed explanation on the subject. I would once again, very respectfully, submit to Sri Harsh Vardhan that his explanation is reminiscent (to me) of not wanting to accept Sastras. I am not trying to make this as a charge; he is a learned man and is entitled to his analysis. Our Upanishads and in fact the entire Vangjmayam is replete with explanations on the subject. From Akasha comes the Vayu, from Vayu comes Agni, from Agni comes Aapah, from Aapah comes Prithvi. Such nuanced and sequential derivations are clearly given as derived from the Viratroopam of Paramatma. Now to question 'What are the panchabhutas?' is specious, because you want it explained in terms of what? There is nothing to explain the (in your words) 'Fundamental' in terms of another Fundamental, since there is only one Fundamental. The Prakriti is also the 'Saguna' part of the 'Nirguna' Satchidananda roopam. Vedas after all spend a lot of effort in explaining that there is no difference between the self made of panchabhutas and paramatma.

  

I am worried my statements may seem aimed at hurting Sri Harsh Vardhan. I assure him that it is not my intent at all.

  

Best Regards,

  

Krishna Kumar Pillalamarri
