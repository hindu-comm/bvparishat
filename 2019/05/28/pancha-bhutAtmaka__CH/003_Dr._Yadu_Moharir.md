Namaste Scholars,

  

Can someone further elaborate the classical / traditional understanding of the term "आकाश" {space (ether)} and it's associated significance as an integral part of pancha-bhutas.

  

Thank you in advance.

  

Dr Yadu

Namaste Krishna Kashyap



You have raised an interesting point on \< science regarding pancha-bhutas earth, water, energy (fire), air, space (ether). \>.
Here are my understanding on this issue:



a) This is a part of 'Guhya (secret) sampradaya of Gita (7-4) explaining ' Prakruti' as shareera' / Kshetra of ' Yogeswara Parama Purusha'.



b) The translation of terms as \< earth, water, energy (fire), air, space (ether)\> is of limited value and constrict the understanding of the tradition. The translation error has a history of at least three centuries.



c) The 'Vishwa' ( Cosmos) as Yogi sees is made up of \< pruthvi, aapah, tejas, vayu, aakaasha, manas, buddhi, ahamtaa \> ; But this
maps-matches only partially with what 'material scientists' speak as ' building blocks of the universe we know' which in science terms are \< atoms, energy particles, molecules, elements, compounds, cosmos, energies of different kinds (electromagnetic, or x-rays or whatever is out there found by science).



 The material scientists deal with building blocks of universe as 'matter without consciousness' . The yoga-vijnana deals with building blocks of universe as ' Matter derived from Consciousness, Matter with consciousness, Conscious Matter ( = Chit- Padartha is also Sat- padartha.)



c) In yoga-vijnana, the 'pruthvi' material of stars and sand-dust is
essentially same. The stars, planets, black holes have the same 'Triguna' as any individual on this earth. The Yoga-Vijnana sees ' Mind in Matter ( Manas is Padartha); Material Science sees Mind and Matter as distinct independent having no co-terminus point ! It is a hot debate of research on 'Mind-Matter - Consciousness' themes in virtual world, AI disciplines.



d) All 8 elements ( Ashta-Prakruti) are related to the entire cosmos, in the frame of Yoga- Vijnana.



**Action point**: The lens to study 'Universe' using Yoga-Vijnana needs to be restored through cleaning the 'translation dust over Samskruth terms of yoga texts, used by material science researchers'.
