Namaste,

  

I think space is the nearest simplest term. However, like with many other words there are multiple levels of meanings as we get more specific. Thus we have रोदसी, अन्तरिक्ष etc with more specific meanings while आकाश remains a general term to refer to the pervasive space. In the immediately visible and physical sense it is the sky.To refer specifically to the non-physical space, prefixes are added - चित्तआकाश,
परमे व्योमन्‌ etc.  

  

Its significance in primal elements is that it is the subtlest element. In the sequence of elements it is told in the last, indicating that it is the source of all other elements and into which all others dissolve. शब्द is its तन्मात्र. If seen in the microcosm or human life, sound is the first the being begins sensing as it assumes life and the last the being loses as it leaves a body.  

  

It is well known that in the inner world, sound/ear assumes far more importance as a subtle sense than eye (as can be seen in for instance नाद बिन्दु उपनिषद), while it is slightly different in the external world.  

  

One can argue that sound needs air to travel and would not travel where there is no matter. However sound like space has multiple levels, mapped to gross subtle causal and eternal. Only the gross/physical sound needs a physical carrier.
