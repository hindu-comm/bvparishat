Namaskar

  

I was wondering if anyone has done a correlation from scriptural texts to science regarding pancha-bhutas

  

earth, water, energy (fire), air, space (ether).

  

How do these really form the building blocks of the universe we know:

  

which science terms:

  

"atoms, energy particles, molecules, elements, compounds, cosmos, energies of different kinds (electromagnetic, or x-rays or whatever is out there found by science)

  

can the pancha bhutas really represent matter as we know in science?

  

I am just wondering if there is a good correlation or interpretation done in a scholarly way.

  

for example "prithvi": does it also include the material of stars, other planets, blackholes etc?

  

Or all these 5 entities are mainly fundamental elements related our earth only?
