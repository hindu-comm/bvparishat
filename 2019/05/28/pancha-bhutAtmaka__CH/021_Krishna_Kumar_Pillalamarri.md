I respectfully submit to Shri Harsh Vardhan that his claim that ' Neither the rishi nor the scientist knows what matter or energy actually is ' is a method of denying everything in Sastras. This has been specifically banned in Sastra. If you need a detailed explanation of the panchabhutas, there are many bhashyas, mainly on Lalita Sahasra Naama Strotram, that explain the derivation of each of the pancha bhutas, proved through their effects, and interactions between each of them. Perhaps what you are saying is that Panchabhutas are actually Eashwara swaroopas, and hence unknowable. But that belies the fact that these are part of the 'Prakriti', which in turn leads us to know Eashwara. Or perhaps you are trying to say everything is 'mithya', which is an age old saying, but that seems to be a facile way of dismissing knowledge.

  

I request you to please explain your statement.

  

Regards,
