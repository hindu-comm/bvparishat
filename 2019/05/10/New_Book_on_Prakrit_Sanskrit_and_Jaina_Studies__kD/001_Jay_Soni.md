Dear Colleagues,

Further to the announcement of the new book, the colour pages of 2 articles inadvertently got printed in black and white.

Should you be interested in the book you might like to have these pages in colour, the way in which they were originally submitted to the publisher.

  

Please let me know if you would like to have them so that I can gladly send them to you.

The book is available with a 15% discount at the moment.

  

Sorry for the inconvenience caused by this unavoidable mistake.

J. Soni
