Hello Jayendra,

Hope you are well and in great spirits. Thanks for sending me news now and then.

Since you have announced this book I thought I can request you to also announce the publication of my book by Munshiram Manoharlal (2018), The title is: "Kaṭhopaniṣad With the commentary of Vijñānabhikṣu called Vedāntāloka "; it is a pioneering work and the very first edited and annotated english translation of one of the Vedānta Aloka commentaries of Vijñānabhikṣu's manuscripts. No Vedāntāloka commentary of Bhikṣu has been published so far.

I had mentioned this to you earlier as well.

All the best and good wishes to you both
