Dear Joshiji,

  

Does a man eat or taste common salt as being made up of sodium and chlorine? What would happen if an individual would consume sodium and chlorine separately? In the same way a person does not hear a word as being made up of letters or a sentence as being made up of words.

  

The concept of sphota tries to unify a sequence of events (letters in a word) with its objective (sense or meaning). Sphota unifies the parts as to present the whole which is the cause of the assembly of the parts.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
