Dear Harshji,

  

I also thought the way you are thinking before I was introduced to the Maheshwar Sutras.

  

My doubt regarding the alphabet was that it can be voiced in two ways.
This doubt was cleared when I learnt to voice the Maheshwar Sutras.
In short one cannot define the articulation of each of the five touch consonants by using the letters in the alphabet. In fact the convention of using the alphabet to teach voicing letters while teaching Sanskrit is the main cause for the various regional variation in Sanskrit diction.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
