Dear Veeraraghavanji,

  

Take for example the sutra नाज्झलौ. Does it not divide the letters into two groups which are mutually exclusive? Is it not similar to metals and non metals?

  

There can be many more parallels. Of course one needs to continuously warn onself that the analogy is meant only for visualization and that the two subjects have nothing in common.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
