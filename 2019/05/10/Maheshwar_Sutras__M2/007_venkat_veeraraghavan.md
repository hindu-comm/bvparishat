Dear Shri Karve ji,

  

What you propose is a very good analogy.

  

"The MaheshwarSutras portray the letters in their elemental form like the elements in chemistry."

  

Did you mean to say "chemical compound form" instead of "elemental form" in the above sentence?

  

It is instructive to see the aksharas as the elements in the periodic table and the MaheshwaraSutras as chemical compounds as they occur in prakriti/nature.

  

Analogies provide people with the requisite handles with which to come to a deeper understanding and should be encouraged.

  

Kind Regards,

  

Venkat
