Dear Vidvans,  
  
I would like to share a few thoughts which occurred to me in the form of an analogy.  
  
How are the Maheshwar Sutras different from those in the the sequence अ, आ, इ, ई.... क, ख, ग घ ......?  
  
The MaheshwarSutras portray the letters in their elemental form like the elements in chemistry. However in words this elemental form takes a molecular form where the elemental form looses is properties as in a chemical compound and acquires properties as a part of a compound.  
  
This will help interpret the concept of sphota forwarded by Bhartrhari.  
  
With regards,  
Achyut Karve.
