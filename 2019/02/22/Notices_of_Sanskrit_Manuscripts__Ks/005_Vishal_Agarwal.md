Namaskar,

  

Indiafacts (thanks to Nitin Shridhar) ran a 13 part series of my article on Shastras, the importance of studying them and the sacred Hindu languages. The purpose of these articles is not to describe our scriptures individually in any great detail, but to create a framework that also links the three - Svadhyaya-Shastras-Devabhasha. The articles will provide introductory level information to any student of Hindu Dharma. I have used these frequently in my own classes for teaching teenagers.

  

Descriptions of individual scriptures are being prepared and it will be a long task given that I have read only a fraction of the thousands of our scriptures. Also, I have largely excluded literature falling in the Artha and Kama categories, focusing on Shastras on Dharma and Moksha. So here are the links:
