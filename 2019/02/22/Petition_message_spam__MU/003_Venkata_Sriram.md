Nagaraj garu,

  

BTW, how effective is [change.org](http://change.org) ? Does this create any impact and does anyone monitor the voting ? We sign the petitions and opinions but any risk is involved in airing our views ?If the outcome of the voting turns out to be majority, has it created impact in the govt. body and corresponding decision making body?

  

Just curious !

  

rgs,

sriram
