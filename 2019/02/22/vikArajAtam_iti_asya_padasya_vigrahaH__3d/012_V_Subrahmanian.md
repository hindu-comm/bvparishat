I would like to point out that Charaka talks about Brahman, a concept that Sankhya-s are not known to have admitted; they are not Brahmavaadins: In the following image, which is just a sample out of many, of the Charaka samhita we see that one attains to Brahman that is nityam, ajaram, etc. For Sankhyas the Tattva is Purusha who is to realize he is different from Prakriti. There is no question of attaining to Brahman for Sankhyas. Also, in the other images that I have collected from the Charaka samhita, there is reference to means to quell jvara by practicing devotion to various deities such as Shiva, Vishnu, Brahma, Nandi, Matruganas, other devata-s, veda, etc. Sankhyas are known to have not espoused the idea of Ishvara/god. They are popularly known as 'nireeshvara saankhya' as opposed to Patanjalas who are 'seshvara sankhya-s'. Both the commentaries to the Charaka samhita, of Chakrapani and Gangadhara, relate Vedanta alone to Charaka samhita. Gangadhara cites Upanishads profusely to several verses/ideas of Charaka. The term 'sankhya' in the verse is also commented upon as tattvajnanam by Chakrapani.
