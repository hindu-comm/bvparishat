During my recent visit to Sanskrit Promotion Foundation's office in Delhi, I saw that they published different shaastra books with the word to word meaning and grammatical analysis to help learn the register ( variety of expression) of Sanskrit of that shaastra.

  

One of the books published by them that way is ashTaangahridayam too.
