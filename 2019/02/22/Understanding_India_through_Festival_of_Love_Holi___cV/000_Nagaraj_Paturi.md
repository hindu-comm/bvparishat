Some of us look for Indologists who might be more empathetic towards their subject matter unlike the growing trend in that discipline of being antipathetic towards the same. This post on the Abhinavagupta list run by Dr Sunthar Visuvalingam discusses a highly senior Indologist Prof. Mc Kim Marriott . I had the good fortune of being personally acquainted with him during my short stint at UChicago. the following is the post by Sunthar-ji.
