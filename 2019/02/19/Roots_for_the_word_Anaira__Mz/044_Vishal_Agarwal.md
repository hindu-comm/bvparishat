[TABLE]

  

  

Due to the bitter cold here, the Garbhagriha is a giant indoor hall housing around 2 dozen separate shrines, of which 1 is a Jain shrine containing the Murtis of Parshvanath, Adinath and Mahavir, in between the shrines of Durga and Meenakshi. All major Jain festivals are observed right there.
