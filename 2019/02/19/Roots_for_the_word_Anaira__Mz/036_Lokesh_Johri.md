Prof. Siddharth:

I think it is wrong to say TOI has fallen in the standard. Newspapers are amass market product and what they publish should be easily readable by theircustomers. For instance, BBC is no more conforming to the "Gold Standard" used (even) 15 years ago. Languages are living and breathing entities. They change and adapt. Who is to decide what is right and wrong? Is American English a "wrong English" because it does not conform to British English? Who carries the mandate to make these decisions? Writing badly out of ignorance of Grammer is lazy but adopting the common usage as the present state of the language is not so. Does Sanskrit suffer from rigiditybrought to it by the "scholars" affecting its' mass adoption even as the language is so beautiful on its'own? The invention of words like "lauhpathgamini" etc.are a pathetic attempt to preserve the purity of a language and would remain confined to the world of trivia.
