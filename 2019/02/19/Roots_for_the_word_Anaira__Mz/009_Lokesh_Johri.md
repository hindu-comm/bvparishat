Madhavji,

Someone named their kid Anaira, A quick web search yields the meaning of the name as "Gift of God" or "brilliance" but otherwise I cannot find any scholarly root for the word.

"Ane" in the Mayrhofer and other places- means the "breath" or the "spirit". But, there is no further reference. Anaira may not mean anything but several non-scholarly sources seem to suggest otherwise.
