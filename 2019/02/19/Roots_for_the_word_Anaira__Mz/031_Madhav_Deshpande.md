This happens in part because languages like Hindi and Marathi contain vocabulary that comes from both Prakrit sources and directly from Sanskrit. Occasionally ऐ, औ result from changes Prakrit \> Apabhraṃśa \> New Indo-Aryan languages like Hindi and Marathi. For example, we can see changes like: Skt bhavati \> bhavai \> havai \> hoi \> HIndi है. A good example in Marathi is the town name पैठण \< प्रतिष्ठान. Here we see the sequence: pratiṣṭhāna \> patiṭṭhāna \> paiṭṭhāna \> पैठण.
