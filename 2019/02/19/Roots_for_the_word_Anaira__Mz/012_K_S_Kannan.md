That's better, Dr Yogananda.

  

I had a student called vandhyA.

Horrified, I asked her to spell properly.

She said Vandhya is fine.

I asked her to confirm with her parents.

  

Next day she came with the answer:

My father is Vandan, and mother is Sandhya.

So I was named Vandhya!

  

(For those few who could not guess why I was horrified,

vandhyaa is a sterile woman,

one who has the problem of infertility).

  

I have come across a girl who said she has a sweet-sounding name:

gaNikA

(which means a prostitute).

  

Aren't our Dittha and Dapittha better names?
