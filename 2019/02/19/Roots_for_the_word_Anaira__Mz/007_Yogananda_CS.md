Namaste,

  

From our sources: अनिराः occurs in the 8th Mandala as you have pointed out.

But that is the only occurrence; other appearances, in 7th, 8th and 10th, are ofअनिरां (-अनिरां इरान्नं अन्नाभावं)

अनिरेण (- इरान्नं) occurs in the 4th.  

Sayana bhashya part is in ( ).

  

regards.......yoga
