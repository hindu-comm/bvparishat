While I personally prefer distinguishing alpa and mahAprANas by h, one must recognize that this is not the historically popular romanization in much of South India, where h served to distinguish the mUrdhanya from the dantya. That, of course, does not automatically make this romanization technique "wrong" or even inferior. So, the right thing to do is think: "Oh - so their romanization map is different from ours", and not act as if they are bumbling.
