Namaste,

  

Given the context of the question - Someone named their kid Anaira - and that the language is also not mentioned, would it not be a futile exercise to go after the word?

  

A personal experience: I had a student by name Sumankar and wondered about it when he told me. He smiled and said \`my father's name is Shankar and my mother Sumathi, so my sisiter was named Shanmathi and I, Sumankar'!
