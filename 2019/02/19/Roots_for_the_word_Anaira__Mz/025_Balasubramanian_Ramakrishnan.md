Prof. Deshpande,

  

I can't speak for other languages, however in Tamil, ta = tha, Ta=ta, da = dha and Da = da. Since there are no mahaAprANa consonants, they are not transcribed. Unless a Tamilian learned Sanskrit, they would not even know these consonants and so it's moot. The Tamilians who did learn how to chant Vedas etc., traditionally used grantham books, but the situation over the last 50 - 60 years has changed - probably for the worse. Note that in Tamil the Ta -> Da and ta -> da under certain conditions (follows a specific set of rules found in the tolkAppiyam) and so the transliteration would reflect that as well. So not ANTAL but ANDAL (ITRANS, not to be mistaken for all capital letters :-)) or without capitalization Andal. Also the ca is pronounced more like sha (not the same as Sanskrit sha) is some cases and the transliteration would reflect that - shivan or sivan and not civan). All in all it's not one-to-one, and was never meant to achieve that.
