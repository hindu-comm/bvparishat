Without diacritics or capitalization or redefining the sounds of some characters like z or q, it is simply impossible to represent distinct sounds using the common English alphabet.

  

As such, ट, ठ, ड, ढ, त, थ, द, ध when transcripted may show up as t, t, d, d, th, th, dh, dh.  
  
Like maruthi. Every southern Karnataka or Tamil person will almost surely read it as मारुति . Or vidhya for विद्या - though vidya is also used in karnataka.

Slightly irregular and region-dependent as noted above.

Transcription differences in Tamil nadu sometimes accurately reflect their (sometimes comically) defective pronunciation arising from modern reliance on this defective script. "Abastamba soodra". As a joke verse of mine goes:  

द्राविडा वाङ्गतुल्याश्च वाङ्गा द्राविडसन्निभाः।  
तयोरुच्चारितं को वा तदन्यो वेत्ति भूतले॥
