The name of our hero who fell into Terrorist State of Pakistan and narrowly escaped the jaws of death is of interest here: Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman, son of Air Marshal Simhakutty Varthaman (both beautiful names). Note the "th" in varthaman. Now, I am not sure if that was deliberately chosen to represent ध (plausible) or त, and if the latter - was his name actually वर्तमान (unlikely) or if it accurately records the tamil mispronunciation of ध (also plausible).
