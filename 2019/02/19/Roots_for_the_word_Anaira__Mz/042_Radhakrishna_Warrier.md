I think Abhinandan is from a Tamil Jain family. So, the intended name is most likely Vardhamān (वर्धमान) as in Vardhamāna Mahāvīra. Tamil writing does not distinguish ta, tha, da, and dha. All these sounds are transcribed by the Tamil character ta (த) which the Tamils usually Romanize as 'th'. That could be the reason for the spelling Varthaman.

  

Interestingly, Abhinandan's father's name is Simhakutty Varthaman.
Simhakutty sounds like a Malayalam word. In Malayalam, Simhakutty can mean either cub lion or the offspring of a lion.
