Even in the case of Roman transliteration,

I do not know whether the problem of these have been addressed:

\- Can तितउ (Vedic) and तितौ (one can think of such a string)  

be represented differently (*titau* stands for both as of now) ?

\- Similarly with Prakrts :  

*pasIau* for पसीअउ (for Sanskrit प्रसीदतु), and even पसीऔ.
