Dear Professor Kannan,

  

  Some scholars have recognized the need for a different notation.
Prof. Alexander Lubotsky of Leiden in one of his publications uses the following:

The issue in Prakrit is somewhat different, since none of the Prakrits have ऐ, औ, and hence the transcriptions "ai, au" represent two consecutive vowels. Similarly, the Prakrits can have "ae, āe, oi, ei, īe" etc., sequences that do not occur in Sanskrit. With best wishes,
