Maybe this Wikipedia entry is more authentic than what Abhinandan told his Pakistani interrogators:

  

"*Abhinandan's family hails from Thirupanamoor, a village near Kanchipuram.\[5\] They are a Tamil Jain family and frequently visit the nearby Karanthai temple*." - <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhinandan_Varthaman>
