Abhinandan and Vardhaman Mahavir are names of Jain Teerthankars. During his captivity, his family organized prayers in Jain Temples. He might have been forced to declare his religion as Hindu, or he said so because many Jains identity themselves as Hindus also. In my city, the Jain Temple is right inside the garbhagriha of the Hindu temple, and many of my childhood friends as well as family members who are Jain’s also called themselves as Hindus.
