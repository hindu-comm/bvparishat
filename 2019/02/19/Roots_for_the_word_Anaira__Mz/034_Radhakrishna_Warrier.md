Malayalam, Kannada and Telugu all have these four categories of consonants:  the khara-s (ka, ca, Ta, ta and pa), the ati khara-s which are mahAprANa-s (kha ,cha, Tha, tha, pha), the mRdu-s (ga, ja, Da, da, ba) and the ghOSa-s which are also mahAprANa-s (gha, Jha, Dha, dha, bha). However, a large number of people speaking these languages are unable to differentiate mahAprANa-s from non-mahAprANa-s. Hence, confusion often prevails not only in Roman transliteration but even when writing in the native scripts. This is similar to the confusion I see among Gujarati and Marathi speakers with regards to the distinction between hrasva (short) /u/ and dIrgha (long) /U/, and also hrasva (short) /i/ and dIrgha (long) /I/. Open any Gujarati or Marathi newspaper, and you can see a large number of instances this confusion.
