Dear Vishvas Ji,

  

  Just for my understanding, what is the conventional South Indian way to transcribe ट, ठ, ड, ढ, त, थ, द, ध? Are these distinctly Romanized in some way, or some of the distinctions are not represented in the Roman transcription? Is there some regularity, or the transcriptions differ in different regions of South India? I am aware that the Tamil script does not have all these distinctions, but Grantha does. As far as my second hand knowledge goes, other scripts like Kannada, Telugu and Malayalam do have distinct written characters for all these distinctions. Any clarification will shed light on the practice of Romanization. Best wishes,
