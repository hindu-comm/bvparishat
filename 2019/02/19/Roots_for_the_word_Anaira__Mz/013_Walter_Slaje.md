\> I would be happy to get a better explanation.  

  

anīra does not exist independently as a noun or an adjective according to the lack of respective entries in any of our dictionaries. There is also no trace of it to be found in Sanskrit literature. Except for a verbal form anīrayitvā (Gopathabrāhmaṇa), where it negates the verbal action īr-.

  

***"anira*** in the Veda"

is not the same as anīra. anira- is derived from írā, a feminine noun meaning "draught, refreshment", which it negates. Accordingly, the noun án-irā in the Veda means "want of vigour, want of food". Used as an adjective (an-irá), it means "destitute of vigour". Āpte follows Mādhava's explanation *anirāḥ prerayitum aśakyāḥ* for an alleged adjectival meaning ("that cannot be propelled or driven along") only for the sole instance in RV 8.48.11. For RV 7.71.2 however, his derivation from írā is in full accord with all other dictionaries.

  

For the linguistic etymology of írā (and of án-irā / an-irá as cognate to írā), see the historic explanation in Manfred Mayrhofer's "Etymologisches Wörterbuch des Altindoarischen", 1. Band. Heidelberg 1992: p. 195.
