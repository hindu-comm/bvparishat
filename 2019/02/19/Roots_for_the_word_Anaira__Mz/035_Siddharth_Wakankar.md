Dear Shri Warrier,

  

Your observation about the confusion among Marathi and Gujarati spellings or way of writing/printing cannot be considered to be absolutely valid because,now a days,no newspaper in any language prints the words as they should be and hence newspaper printing should not be considered to be valid proof of any sort.

  

Even Times of India has scores of mistakes in English grammar, construction etc. In our childhood,we were required to read Times of India to improve our proficiency and vocabulary,but,that is not a case now.

  

It is a pity that most of the reporters of almost all the newspapers in English and Indian languages as well as the speakers or news.writings on the TV are faulty.e.g.where to keep the Repha( half र्) is a problem.What to do under these circumstances?

  

So, newspaper language cannot be counted to be always correct.

  

Excuse me if I hurt anybody's feelings by this observation.  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
