Hello Marcis,

  

I do not know any source where the declensions of all pronouns are given. But Ruupachandrikaa lists a few of them.

And provides a list under each of them of other pronouns which behave like those declined.

  

You may try <http://sanskrit.uohyd.ac.in/scl> -> tools - \> noun generator

  

I would be happy to fix the errors if any, in my generator :-)

  

  

Best,  

Amba
