On-line resource for declensions of many pronouns is also at

\<<https://ia800308.us.archive.org/22/items/SHABDAMANGARISAMSKRUTHAM/SHABDA%20MANGARI%20SAMSKRUTHAM.pdf>\>

Please see PDF-pages 56 to 70. (Book's Pages 58 to 72) Word Nos. 91 to 125. Below these 35 declension tables, "similar" pronouns are also listed.

On PDF page 56 first of all, the pronouns are classified into six classes

Interestingly the author calls डतर and डतम to be प्रत्यय-s, which get affixed as तर and तम respectively, maybe, ड being considered as an इत् vide चुटू (1'3'7)

It seems in \<किंयत्तदो निर्द्धारणे द्वयोरेकस्य डतरच् 5'3'92\> also डतरच् has been mentioned as a प्रत्यय only.

Notes (foot-notes) on Book-pages 58 and 59 are also very good.
