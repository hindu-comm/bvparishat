Dear list members,

We are developing a digital app of Bhagavad-Gita in all major Indian languages with a visual presentation of 18 chapters.

We are looking for a person with music background, who can support us to compose background score and mixing of recital and narrative portions.



\*The reason to post this message here is that I believe there might be someone who is aware of Bhagavad-Gita and the music too in this group.

Interested may mail me for further details.

  

Regards.

Arjun Kashyap (Ph.D.)
