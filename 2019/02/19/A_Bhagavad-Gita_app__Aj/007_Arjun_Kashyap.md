Dear Shastry ji,

First of all I apologise for a late response. I am very thankful for your precious suggestions.

As our organisation is putting efforts to develop the App on Bhagavadgītā from last 3 years. There are separate teams; i.e. design and animation team, Content team, IT team etc. working for this project. We are trying to bring out the Bhagavadgītā with graphical motion slides. In multiple user languages, if the users opt for Hindi, they will get the Bhagavadgītā app in Hindi which contains:

**  
**

**Śravaṇam**: This is an audio mode with recital of Bhagavadgītā. (Musical presentation in the sense, it will be sung by an artist with a soothing music theme. That is indeed Bhagavat-yoga-saṃvāda, but that cannot be merely presented as a prose.) And another option which gives the recital along with the narration of the commentary (in chosen language).

  

**Manannam**: Is a book mode, here one can read the entire Bhagavadgītā Ślokas, translation, external notes etc.

  

**Darśanam**: is an animation mode, developed for each Śloka, which gives the relevant idea on each concept. The animation is designed with the rich handmade arts by various artists.

  

\*This will be launched in all major Indian languages and few European languages.

  

Our target is to spread the message of The Supreme to the entire world.

  

I am glad to get suggestions from the prominent scholars like you.

  

Regards.

*Dr.Arjun Kashyap*
