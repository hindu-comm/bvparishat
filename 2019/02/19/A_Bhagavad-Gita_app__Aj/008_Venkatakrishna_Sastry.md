Namaste

Please contact me off line as some suugeestions i may make will be of specific interest and needs of audience only.

I would be happy to share the content i had developed earlier for a worthy project; if it can help the efforts at rediscovering the wheel.

  

I am of the opinion ( rather conviction) that yoga way of practicing Gita needs to be restored from the present mode of gita reading for vedanta.

  

Please feel free to contact.

  

Regards
