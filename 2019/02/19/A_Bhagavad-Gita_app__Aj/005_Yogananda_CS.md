Namaste,

  

I would highly recommend Sri R K Shriramkumar ([rkshriramkumar.org](http://rkshriramkumar.org)). He has rich experience in composing music to the kinds of project you have outlined. If you would like, I could help in connecting you with him. You could check out the Android app Tungalahari where his work can seen.
