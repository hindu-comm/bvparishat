***An additional note***:

  

*The Bhagavad-Gita is translated into 8 Indian languages and the voice over for the visual presentation is also done by our organisation. We are even experimenting the recital in various rAgAs with the help of few classical singers.*

*  
*

*I kindly request the group members to help me out in searching a music composer for this divine project.*

*  
*

Regards.

Arjun Kashyap.
