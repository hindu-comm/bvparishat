Namaste Arjun Kashyap



While Appreciating your interest in Gita Digital Project, please permit me to make some suggestions for your consideration.



My credentials for making this suggestion: I was the Project visionary and executive who got produced the First Multimedia Encyclopedia CD -Rom in 1985 and got it marketed globally. The content covering all 18 chapters Gita ( with Text and Musical rendering of text- musical Voice), Gita related images , visuals, and art details, Gita related several writings and books, Animated Stories and Games . The technology platform was Windows 95 progressing to XP/ 2000.



Suggestion 1: Gita Translations: It is not enough to put Gita - Translations ported from Print media to Digital text format and provide tools for search and the like ! 



Suggestion 2: Gita Visual presentations: This needs a greater conceptual clarity ! If your project needs to be different from the
commercial cinemas which have created a public image , unique and true to Gita essence as Visual. Other wise, your project could end up as a **'Holly wood Gita** Production' as an upgrade of ' South Indian Mahabharatah/ Dashavataar / Krishnaavatar productions' , than traditional Divine Project.



Suggestion 3: \< Gita slokas - *recital in various rAgAs with the help of few classical singers.*\> apart from pleasure of ears as ' nice tunes', how is one elevating the ' Yoga- Sacred Dialogue (Bhagavat- Yoga-Samvaada) ' to ' Yoga- Musical rendering and concert ( bhagavat- Sangeetha - kaccheri) ' ? Help me to understand what traditional evidence supports your idea here? Ramayana of Valmiki was 'sung'.
Mahabharata was ' Kathaanak - Social Religious Text - Oral Narrative'. How would one fix a raaga for the specific sloka of Gita ?



If you think my earlier work experience may be useful in your current project, please feel free to contact me off the line.



Regards
