Friends,

  

Valmiki does talk about multi-story houses. In Ayodhya, they sounded like

hyperbole. In Lanka, women are jumping from tall buildings with babies in arms

as part of Lanka burning.  

  

Two questions:

  

1. Any reference of tall buildings in Mahabharata

2. Any research on carpentry and building construction in ancient times.

 (indus Period shows two story brick houses)

  

Thank you for your help.

Dear sir

Mayamatam, Samarangana sutradhara, etc. deal with building construction in ancient India. Prof. A S Nene has edited a book on the same topic. You can find some information in Google.

  

Thanks and Regards
