As far as I know, Patañjali is familiar with the Mīmāṃsā of Kāśakr̥tna, but does not refer to either Jaimini or Bādarāyaṇa. Jaimini and Bādarāyaṇa refer to each other and both refer to Kāśakr̥tsna. The identity of Pārāśarya-Bhikṣusūtra with Bādarāyaṇa's Vedāntasūtras is possible, but not conclusively established. The discussion between Aklujkar and Bronkhorst is probably the best latest thinking on this general subject. Thanks, Ashok, for sharing both. With best regards,
