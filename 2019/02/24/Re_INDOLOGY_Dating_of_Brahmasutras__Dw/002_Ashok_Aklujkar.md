There are many scattered discussions in the writings on Paninian grammar and history of Vedānta. I do not have time at the moment to dig them up, since I am preparing for three weeks of travel and lectures. However, please start with the indexes of George Cardona’s two volumes surveying Paninian research and the index to the latest edition of Yudhiṣṭhira Mīmāṁska’s \_Saṁskṛta Vyākaraã Śāstra kā itihāsa\_. Surveys of research on the history of Vedānta will also help. I will add specifics of the latter if time permits.
