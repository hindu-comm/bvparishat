Thank you Sir for the response. My doubt is: If the Rshi's had the smaraNam of the Veda mantras that existed in the previous kalpa, 'as it existed', then alone we can account for the 'आनुपूर्वीसमानत्वम्' of the Vedic mantras, the entire Veda corpus, across various yugas/kalpas. If we admit that the Rshi's 'knew/understood the meaning/concepts' and then gave expression to their understanding/bodha and that is called 'mantras', then the idea that 'Veda mantras have been the *same* across all yugas/kalpas without any change' cannot be validated. This was my purport.

  

warm regards
