Someone gave this reference:

  

कालापक \[ kālāpaka \] the school of Kalāpin Lit. Pāṇ. 4-3 , 104 Lit. Kāś.  
the Veda recension of this school Lit. ib. 101 Vārtt. 1 Lit. Pat. Lit. Sarvad.  

N. of the Kātantra grammar Lit. Kathās. vii , 13.

  

I think the word has been explained in the kaashika vritti/vartika of the vyakarana shaastram.
