Dear all,

This is to inform that I have found a manuscript with the title KapiSThala-kaTha-GRhyasUtra in the Asiatic Society, Kolkata. It is incomplete, first foloio is missing, and some lines are omitted. Hence I find difficulty in editing the text. The extant KapiSThala-KaTha-SaMhitA of KYV edited by Raghu Vira is also incomplete. Learned members are requested to inform me about other manuscripts/texts/resources/studies of the said school, if available.

With warm wishes,

Nabanarayan Bandyopadhyay
