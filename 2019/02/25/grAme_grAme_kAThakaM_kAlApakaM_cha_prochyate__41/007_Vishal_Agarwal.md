The Kalaapa Shakha is typically taken to mean the Maitrayaniyas.'Katha-Kalaapa' is used as a standard phrase in many works (Just like 'Srughna-Pataliputra', even much after the destruction of Srughna), and I recall seeing it used by Shankaracharya too in one of his Bhashyas (Shaariiraka?) although he barely quotes from the Maitrayani Upanishad or other texts of this Shakha. Please see attached the paper in this regard. Pandit Bhagavadatta tries to relate the origin of this Shakha to the Kalaapagraama which he places in the Gilgit region and it appears far-fetched. Some scholars like Shri T N Dharmadhikari however hold that the Maitrayaniyas were separate from Kalapa Shakha. The Charanavyuha does not mention Kalaapa Shakha as you state, and the Prapanchahridaya does not mention it as well does not mention the Maitrayaniyas either. It appears that they never moved south of Godawari till recent decades (see next para) though both the Maitreyi and Maitrayani Upanishads figure in the 108 Upanishads collection.

  

Historically in recent centuries, followers of this Shakha have been known to exist in western Vindhyas, and land grands indicate their presence in MP, Chhatisgarh, Odisha, Gujarat and Maharashtra. Harshacharita mentions a Buddhist scholar who was of Maitrayani Shakha and resided on the Vindhyas. Most manuscripts and followers were located in Morbi (Gujarat) and in the Dhule-Nandurbar districts and Nashik areas in an around Muler (Mayur Parvat according to Shri C G Kashikar). A few decades back, I clearly recall hearing recitation of portions of its Samhita in Nashik but printed reports emphasize that now it is extinct there. Anyway, before it became extinct there, scholars from Tamil Nadu learned it and now there are students in Kumbhakonam and in Sitanagaram (AP). I also have a recording of the entire Samhita and Aranyaka chanted with svaras in the Charaka Pathashala of Marathwada and this was made available to me from [vedamu.org](http://vedamu.org) I had tallied the recitation with the printed editions of the Aranyaka/Upanishad and found that only Satavalekar's edition matches completely.

  

For this Shakha, we have the Maitrayani Samhita, the Maitrayani Aranyaka (aka Maitrayani Upanishad) available with accents in written and oral traditions. Some scholars hold that the latter is a late Upanishad or at least parts of it are late which is why Shankaracharya does not quote from it (and so doesn't Ramanujacharya), but one can see quotations from it or paraphrases from it (all parts of the Upanishad) in Mahabharata (Vana Parva), Yoga Yajnavalkya, Yuktidipika, Vakyapadiyam and in many other pre-Shankara works. His own grand disciple Jnanaghanapada quotes from it in his works, and so do followers of Ramanujacharya like Sudarshanasuri (see his commentary on Vedarthasamgraha).The Chhagaleya Upanishad is also from the Chhagaleya Upashakha of this branch (and shows some Maitrayani Sandhis).

  

The Brahmana is considered lost, but quoted by Apastamba etc. Sayana/Skandasvami and even Nirukta of Yaska quote by name the Haridravi Brahmana and it is an Upashakha of Maitrayaniyas. Pannini mentions Chhagaleyas too. The available 'Aruneyi Upanishad' is also quoted as 'Maitrayani Brahmana' in medieval Sannyasa paddhatis, which is interesting because Aruni is one of the Upashakhas of Maitrayaniyas according to Vedavriskha. Note that the Manava Shrauta Sutra of this Shakha also prescribes a Samskara for taking Sannyasa which corresponds considerably to the extant Kathashruti Upanishad. Other texts available are Manava Grhya, Manava Shulba, Maitrayani Shulba, Parishishtas, Varaha Shrauta-Grhya, Varaha Parishishtas (not published in entirety yet, including their Shulba, manuscript at Mumbai). A manuscript of the Harita Dharmasutra is reported as belonging to this Shakha, but unfortunately it is not printed yet. See attached paper on this. This Dharmasutra is quoted in Dharma Nibandhas as recently as 1700s.

  

The preface by Shridhar Shastri Vare of the Satavalekar edition of the Maitrayani Samhita quotes from a Maitrayani Pratisakhya based on 2 manuscripts borrowed by Pandit Vare from two different families in Maharashtra (addresses of these families given by Pandit Yudhishthir Mimamsaka in 'Vyakarana Shastra ka Itihas') but the fate of these manuscripts is not known. Earlier on this list, Dr Madhav Deshpande had mentioned his stay in Nashik to trace them from the Nagar Vachanalaya collection, but without success.
