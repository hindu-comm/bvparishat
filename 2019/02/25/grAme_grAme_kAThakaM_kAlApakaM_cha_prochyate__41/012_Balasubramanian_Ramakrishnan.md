Thank you Vishal-ji for this wonderful summary and references. Thanks to advaita-sharada, I was able to locate bhagavatpAda's commentary on the bR^ihadAraNyaka 4.3.1 on ArthabhAga's question on the graha-s and atigraha-s,यथा कतमेऽत्र कठाः कतमेऽत्रकालापाइति.

  

So it seems that the name kAlApa was in vogue much later than pata\~njali-muni. It's interesting that the caraNa-vyUha fails to mention this name.
