Namaste Subbu-ji

  

I think kAlApaka merely means collection, or the collection the kAThaka texts. Whether it refers to the texts of a particular kaTha shAkha that bhgavAn pata\~njali had in mind, or whether it refers to the different kaTha shAkha-s such as kaTha, prAcya-kaTha, kapiShThala-kaTha, etc. is not clear. As per the caraNa-vyUha, the caraka-s (of the kR^ishNa yajurveda) had 12 divisions, of whom these kaTha shAkhinaH form 3 divisions.
