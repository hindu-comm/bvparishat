Namaste

  

There is a famous quote:ग्रामे ग्रामे काठकं कालापकं च प्रोच्यतेof the Mahabhashya of Patanjali.

  

What is the meaning of the above sentence? Is it that in every village the KaaThaka and KAlApaka were being recited? I think kAThaka a separate recension of the Veda. What is kAlApaka?

**Explanation of the above may please be given.**

**Thanks**
