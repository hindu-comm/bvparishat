Thank you for these very useful papers. I recall reading somewhere that 'kalaapa' means peacock feathers, which incidentally reminds one of the Mayura Parvat!

  

Rishi Maitreya appears in the Mahabharata, AND also in the Harivansha Purana (the latter also mentions this Shakha) besides being mentioned in northern manuscripts of the Ramayana (the said verse, quoted in an earlier post of this thread, was included in the critically constituted text although it is absent in NW Manuscripts). These indicate its close association with the Shaurasena/Mathura region in very ancient times. I think there is a verse in the Mahabharata wherein Bhagavan Krishna is specifically said to have studied the Yajurveda - I wonder if Bhagavan Krishna had studied the Maitrayani Shakha or some Shakha that was close to it. Scholars have noticed the similarity of the Gita's teachings to the Maitrayani Upanishad (and of course, to the Katha and Shvetashvatara - all belonging to Krishna Yajurveda).

  

A very distinctive feature of the Maitrayani Upanishad is its Surya Upasana, which is mentioned specifically as taught by 'Maitri Shruti' in the Brihad-yogi-yajnavalya published by the Kaivalyadhaama, Lonavla.

  

The extensive loss this Shakha suffered seems indicated by the fact that its Upanishad is quoted as 'Maitra-Varuni Shruti' (instead of Maitrayaniya Shruti) in several works like the commentary of Sudarshana Suri on Vedarthasamgraha of Shri Ramanujacharya. Shadgurushishya in his Devatanukramani also notes that he had not studied the Maitrayani Brahmana.

  

A few years ago, I recall a conversation with Brahmashri Shri Narendra Kapre-ji over Padapatha (of RV) etc and incidentally I had asked him his views on the authenticity of the Mait Up. He said that the traditional Vaidiks do not uniformly honor this Upanishad ('vidvat samaj mein itna aadar nahiin hai'), if I remember correctly. Scans of Maitrayani Upanishad manuscripts with accents marked from 16th cent or so are available on the net.
