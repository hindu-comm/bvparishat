A friend of mine sent me this information regarding this book which was available earlier on [archive.org](http://archive.org). Howeverboth volumes have been removed. If anyone has a way to get this, please help:

  

Sanskrit Commentary PDF of Gudartha-sangraha on Sribhashya by Abhinava-ranganatha-parakala swamy  

  

I got the volume 2 downloaded when it was available. However, I am looking for volume 1.

  

If anyone is looking for a recent scholarly work on sribhashya, this is the one.

It includes so many inter scholastic issues addressed post Sri Vedanta Desika who was in 13th century. Incidentally, this book was possible, since my teacher, Maha-mahopadhyayaK.S Varadachar took notes while learning from his teacher Parakala-swamyand published his notes.

  

I have shared this link for volume 2 for interested people.
