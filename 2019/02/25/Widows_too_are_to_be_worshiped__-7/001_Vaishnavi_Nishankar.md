Namaste,

  

We follow a custom of honouring a widow who adheres to the vaidhavya-dharma in memory of a vidhavaawho lived the same way of life and passed away in our family. This is done before auspisciousevents like marriage, upanayana etc. and is called as 'saadevi'.

  

\[We belong to the Southern (Tanjavuri) Marathi speaking Maadhva community, just in case this information matters.\]
