Dear Sirs,

  

Thank you for these details.

  

I mentioned the Maharashtrian Madhavacharya from Thanjavur because I think he might have referred to this local tradition any some of his works. Am not sure. Let some Marathi scholar throw light on this unusual but prevalent practice.

  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
