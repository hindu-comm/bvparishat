In the Chaturvarga Chintamani Vol.2, part 1, Vrata kaaNDa, Hemadri mentions a Gowri chaturthi vrata from the Brahma purana. What surprised me is that in this vrata apart from sumangali-s (married women with husband alive), even widows, vidhavA-s are to be worshiped.

There is a general thinking/practice among the orthodox that widows should not attend auspiciousevents as their presence augurs inauspiciousness. Here we see widows too are to be worshiped. Could anyone please clarify if in any cultures in our Bharata desha such practice is in vogue?

  

Thanks andregards
