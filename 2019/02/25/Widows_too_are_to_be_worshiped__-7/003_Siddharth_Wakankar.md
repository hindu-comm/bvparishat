Dear Madam,

  

Your belonging to a Thanjavur Marathi family following Maadhva tradition is a very important information.

  

By the way,who is this Madhva?

  

The great Vedanta scholar of Vedanta or Madhavaswami,the great Marathi scholar from Thanjavur who composed Marathi works on Ramayana,Mahabharata etc.His contribution is still not much known even to the scholars of Marathi literature.

  

We have some of his works in the form of unpublished manuscripts in the Oriental Institute, Baroda.

  

Kind regards.  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
