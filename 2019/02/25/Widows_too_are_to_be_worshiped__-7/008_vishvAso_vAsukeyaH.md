Incidentally, since this also could modulate the charge that hindus necessarily mistreated widows - I recall the following about AhitAgni vidhura-s (widowers) from godAvarI district from [David Knipe's book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23462846-vedic-voices?ac=1&from_search=true):  
  
  

"  

As a widower Yajulu could eat no rice for the evening meal, only phalahara

snacks, with rice, essential “food,” at noon only. One day in his last years he

reminisced and recalled his mother at the age of eighty-six. “She suddenly

asked me a strange question: ‘Boy, has God (devudu) forgotten to call me?

Somebody please tell him!’ I understand her feelings now.” He died July 30,

2005, only four months after an annual sabha was founded in his name in

Sriramapuram. He was burned on the same spot as Surya almost a decade

before.
