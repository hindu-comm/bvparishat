Dear all,

  

I am glad to inform that the advaita academy has uploaded my talks on Valmiki Ramayana which can be seen in the following link. About 176 talks have been uploaded so far. I have read out several slokas while explaining the text and explained the commentaries of Govindaraja and Tryambaka makhi mostly.
