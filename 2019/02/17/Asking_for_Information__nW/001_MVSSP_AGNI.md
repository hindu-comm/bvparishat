Respected sir,

            I shared your post in a whatsapp group.In that group one person replied and if it's useful you may contact him. Thank you.

  

Namaste Mahodaya,

  

It’s a very nice and a praiseworthy initiative. This is the the first step to achieve “Developing Interest and respect towards a language”

  

Appreciate your efforts in this regard.

  

Coming to a few sources, you may reach out to the following people:

  

1\. Vyoma linguistics labs : Venkatasubramanian and Viswanathan ji

  

2\. Samskrita Bharati

  

3\. Veda Vigyana Gurukulam: Dr. B K Vinayachandra

  

I know the sources 1 and 3 personally and feel they’ll be able to throw light on the contents you have planned.

  

Feel free to reach out to me for any further info!

  

Regards

Raghunandana
