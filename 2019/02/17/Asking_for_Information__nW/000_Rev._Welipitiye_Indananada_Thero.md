Namaskaaraha !

  

Dear Scholars,

I hope to conduct some lectures to Sanskrit studens in our university on "Sanskrit in Modern Context" to educate them on the nature of Sanskrit Studies and new trends/tendencies therein in the present world. But I have only few sources regarding the topic.

The topics that I hope to discuss as follows:

  

(a) Sanskrit in modern literature

(b) Sanskrit in theatre, cinema, and television

(c) Social media and Sanskrit knowledge systems

(d) Contemporary scholarly assemblies (*vidvatsabhā*), traditional examinations (e.g.*Śalākāparīkṣā*) etc.

(e) Computational linguistics and Sanskrit

(e) Modern trends in the usage of Sanskrit

(f) Contemporary scholarship in Sanskrit (scholars, conferences, journals, summer schools, workshops, current research projects and funding sources, issues and limitations etc.).

Therefore, I seek your advice, guidance and assistance to do this work.
I kindly request you to suggest me suitable sources too.  

  

Thank you.
