Namaste Sir!

I am also doing research work on "Science and Technology in Sanskrit"

I completed my M.Phil from JNU (SANSKRIT SCHOOL) and my research topic was "The Scientific Analysis of Panchamahabhutas in Indian Philosophy: In the Perspective of Global Sustainable Development".

I felt good when saw your email. Really nice thing as you want to discuss.
