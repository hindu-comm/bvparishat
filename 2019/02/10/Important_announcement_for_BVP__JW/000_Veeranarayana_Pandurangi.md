It is very important thing to note for BVP members that prof Korada Subrahmanyam mahodaya is elected as the chairman of Governing council of BVP. This decision was endorsed by many members who were present in BVP meet held on 5.1.19.

Most of the BVP members (or the frequent posters of BVP) present or present in the meeting of Udupi unonimously accepted this decision. I hope this will be acceptable to other BVP members who could not come o Udupi too.

  

He is expected to announce members of this governing council soon.

  

A trust with the Same name is formed for the purpose of execution of works as decided by GC too. Expediting reason to form Trust was the Udupi conference.
