Dear Scholars

I join others in congratulating Prof. Tatacharya, Prof.Korada and Prof.Aklujkar for the honours conferred on them at Udupi. Further good news is about BVP being strengthened and getting registered. Whatever may be the formal status of BVP, this has been a great forum, for persons like me wanting to learn as a third party, reading the discussions among members. I take this opportunity to thank the founders of BVP, Prof.Varakhedi and Prof.Pandurangi for creating such an excellent intellectual platform for persons addicted to BhAratIya Samskr.ti.

Regards

RN Iyengar
