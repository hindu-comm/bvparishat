Dear friends,  

I am glad that Prof Korada has accepted this position.

The group is honored to have Prof Korada participate with the scholarly zeal that

he exhibits on any question or concept. His erudite analysis is an education by

itself and his style of presentation is a model to scholars worldwide.

Let BVP continue to flourish with Prof Korada's leadership.

Best regards.

Happy Vasanta Panchami.
