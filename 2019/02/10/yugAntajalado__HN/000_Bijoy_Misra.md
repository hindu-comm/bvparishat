Dear friends,  

  

I came across this line in Valmiki (V. 54.20), Sundarakanda.  

  

ननाद हनुमान् वीरो युगान्तजलदो यथा

  

There are some astronomical speculations on युगान्त.

  

Do people have reference to such speculations?  

Earlier he had said about the sun getting larger etc at युगान्त .

  

Thank you for any help.
