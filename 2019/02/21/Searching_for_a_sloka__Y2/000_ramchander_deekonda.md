Respected scholars,  
  
I am searching for a verse that tells something to the effect: neither hundred Suns nor hundred Moons can, but only a learned Guru can dispel the inner darkness of a person.  
  
I would be grateful if scholars can kindly provide me the text of the sloka.  
  
Regards,  
  
Ramchander Deekonda
