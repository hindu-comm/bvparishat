Respected mishra sir,  
I have a devaartharchana which is known as panchayatanam. It's in my daily routine. And I want to study the sahasranama and their vyakhya to understand the nama. Being it's my daily routine it won't hurt my other duties.  
Secondly I can't dare to think about the puranic scriptures without proper vyakhya . Its because I don't have enough standards and I may misinterpret it's meaning. Hence I asked.  
For me sahasranamas are to perform puja . If i perform puja after knowing meaning my standard may increase . Thats the purpose of this sahasranama for me.
