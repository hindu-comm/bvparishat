Prasad ji,

  

Jaina muni Bhanuchandra Gani has written a tika on Surya Sahasranama. It is available online at <https://jainelibrary.org/book-detail/?srno=004472>

  

It is said in the preface of the above book that emporer Akbar studied Surya Sahasranama from Bhanuchandra Gani and started chanting it daily.  

  

regards  
shankara
