RESPECTED SCHOLARS,

 ITS WELL KNOWN THAT IN THE PANCHAYATANA THERE EXISTS 5 DEVATS. I GOT SAHASRANAMA VYAKHYAS FOR ALL THE 4 DEVATA GANAS EXCEPT ADITYA OR SURYA DEVA.



FOR SIVA SAHASRANAMA IN THE SAME GROUP I GOT NILAKANTHA VYAKHYA  

FOR VISHNU SAHASRANAMA ADI SANKARACHAEYA'S BHASHYA IS AVAILABLE

FOR AMBICA DEVI LALITA SAHASRANAMA SOUBHAGYA BHASKARA BHASHYAM OF BHASKARA RAYA IS AVAILABLE

FOR GANESHA SAHASRANAMA BHASKARARAYA'S COMMENTARY IS AVAILABLE.

  

BUT FOR AADITYA OR SURYA SAHASRANAMAS I DONT KNOW ABOUT ANY VYAKHYA.

  

SO I REQUEST ALL THE SCHOLARS TO TELL ME ABOUT THE AUTHOR WHO WROTE VYAKHYA FOR SURYA SAHASRANAMA AND THE PUBLISHER WHO PUBLISHER DETAILS.

 THANK YOU
