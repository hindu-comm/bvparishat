Dear Sri Prasad,

  

I am not correcting you. I am requesting to reflect

to understand the triviality of your writing. Please

reflect on the first question and write after a year.  

Don't rush. Let knowledge bake inside. Take long

walks. Visit teachers. Please go on a period of

introspection. You would find the answer. The Gita

did say the answer is inside. Be bold and willful.

  

This is my last mail on this track.  

  

Thank you for listening.
