Dear Sri Prasad,

All I request is to put a bit extra curiosity into the material

than doing some rote repetition. The god is inside, he would

support you when you make a move to find him. Spend less

time in repetition, more in contemplation. Collectively we  

can help build India for the twenty-first century!  

I thought that's what came out of the Churning Symposium.

Best regards,

BM
