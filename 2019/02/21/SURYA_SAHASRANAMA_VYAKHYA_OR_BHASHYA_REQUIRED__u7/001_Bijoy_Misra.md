Dear Sri Prasad,

  

Would you also mention what drives you to request these materials?

Are you researching something or collecting materials for future studies?

I do see the global requests which appear to me as pure leisurely use of communication.

Let us get a bit more focused and put energy in our intent and the studies.

  

First think what a sahasranama is. Why is it created?

Is it cosmology or a religious ritual? Why there would be different sahasranamas

for different divinities? Do they relate to each other?  

  

Collectively we can make BVP more interesting - so is my hope.

Please help.

  

Thank you.  

  

BM
