Akbar's sons were going against him. In order to help himself, he did resort

to various therapies. He also got into the Jesuits. The whole Islam and the  

Jesuits are into prayers since they have no land to stand on. I am studying

Akabar and others for our next seminar. Attaching the flier.  

I would think the modern Indians should keep more faith on their own strength

and find peace in work. God would be seen through the sincere pursuit of  

knowledge and discovering one's own creativity..

The latter is the creed of Hinduism as I see.
