Respected sir,  

 I first say thank you for your valuable advice to think. AND YOU PRESENTED 5 QUESTIONS infront of me . I will try to answer them please correct if any mistakes. Thank you.

Q.no: 1 WHAT IS A SAHASRANAMA S

 ANS. A sahasranama means having 1000 names.

 SAHASRA has also a different meaning Some time SAHASRA is depicted with the meaning of ANANTA . although its difficult to hold the ananta nama s of the god they are scrutinized to 1000 names.

THE PURUSHA SUKTA says "SAHASRA SEERSHA PURUSHAHA SAHASRAKSHAHA SAHASRAPATH". by this we may feel to describe the sahasra seershas and others SAHASRA NAMA WAS CREATED.  

IN the above purusha sukta its told as THE god has SAHASRA SEERSHAS AND SAHASRA ASKSHAS . Actually in general every man head has two eyes by saying god has sahasra seershas it should be DWISAHASRA AKSHAS but its not like. So we have to consider the meaning of sahasra as ANANTA here. That meaning is only suitable here.

  

Q.no:2 WHY IT IS CREATED?

  

ANS: there are 4 types of devotees according to gita and there exists trigunas in every one so inorder to create satisfication for the 12 types of devotees ( 4 types of devotees \* 3 gunas = 12) these are creted.

  

Q.no: 3 Is it a cosmology or a religious ritual?

  

ANS. It depends upon the devotee who is worshipping . " YE YATHA MAAM PRAPADANTE ". MAINLY WE CAN SAY 3 TYPES HERE THEY ARE KARMA, BHAKTI AND THEJNANA, for the person who takes it as a ritual its a karma. For the person who feels himself as a devotee and worships its a bhakti and for the person who thniks its a tattva for him.

The sahasranama is neither a cosmology nor a ritual but it involves both of them. Not only both but also every thing.  

  

Q.no:4 DIFFERENT SAHASRA NAMAS FOR DIFFERENT DIVINITIES - WHY?

  

ANS. Its because to satisfy the self of the jiva who has to get the moksha. Every person has different thoughts and feelings . One divine body may not be connected by every one. The likes and dislikes may vary from jiva to jiva due to MAYA. So its difficult satisfy every Jiva with one sahasranama and one divine body. Hence different sahasranamas for different divinities occurred.,

  

Q.no: 5 DO they relate to each other.

ANS. YES.EVERY TWO SAHASRANAMS HAS CONNECTION. Although the divine body differs but they are interconnected.

Examples:

[1.IN](http://1.IN) VISHNU SAHASRANAMA he is having a name SIVA  

2\. IN LALITA sahasram she is depicted as GAYATRI & in gayatri sahasra
GAYATRI devi is having a name DUNDHI VIGHNESA JANANI who is PARVATI.  

3\. In every sahasranama the god is depicted as PARABRAHMA who performs SRUSTHI, STHITHI & LAYAM.  

By these we can say they are interconnected.

  

Sir if any mistakes in me please correct me.
