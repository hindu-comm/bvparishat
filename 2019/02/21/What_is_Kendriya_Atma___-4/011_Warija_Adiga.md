I apologize for the error in reporting the session. I was listening intently to the lecture, and interpreted Atma as being the central figure, and automatically "kendriya" got added I guess. I did not have any reference document to validate and correct it. I am so glad that it is being discussed and the real quotations have been shared.

  

This is another example, of what was discussed in the conference, on how words get mis-represented through translations, even with best of effort. Respected Sri Janardan Hegde's contention that one should always read the original work, seems to be validated again :)

  

I sincerely thank Sudarshan for reading the document and putting the query here, and thank all the scholars for clarifying and correcting the error.

  

I am going to update the report and share it again.

  

With a lot of respect,

Warija Adiga
