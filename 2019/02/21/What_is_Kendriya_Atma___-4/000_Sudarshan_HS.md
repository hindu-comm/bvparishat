नमांसि विद्भ्यः॥

  

Warija Adiga's report on the BVP Conference has been very useful to us.

  

I read about Prof. JSR Prasad's talk titled "Ayurveda deals with science", where I saw the terms "केन्द्रियात्मा" and "प्रसन्नात्मा" ।  

  

I am interested to know if these are technical terms from Ayurveda, and what do they mean?

Prof JSR Prasad - Ayurveda deals with Science

Professor took an example to आत्मा/शरीर story start his session. A student tells the guru that only Atma is important and not body. Guru sends the student to a jungle, where by some miracle he becomes a goat. He sees a tiger and is scared out of his wits. When guru finds him later, the student recalls his experience. The guru explains that if only atma was important, he would not have been scared, the same atma was in the human form or the goat’s. This allegory proves, as much as atma is important, the external body is important. This is what Ayurveda tries to emphasize.

Kendriya atma/ prasanna atma when translated, the context is distorted.  
Yoga and Ayurveda are least researched areas. They have philosophical contexts, which are not taught, not included in syllabus. Dependence on translation has destroyed the meaning. Yoga, dharma are words, which cannot be translated.  
What next for Indic studies -  
Fight against bad translation, correct translation, include Ayurveda and Yoga as part of Indic studies.
