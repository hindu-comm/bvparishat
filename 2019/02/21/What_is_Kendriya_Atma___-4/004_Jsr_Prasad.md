Namaste Sri Sudarshan ji,

  

Prof. Savita ji has provided a nice explanation.

I just thought to add; the point I was trying to make is - the swastha-lakshanam refers to 'प्रसन्नात्मा' and आत्मा is said to be निर्विकार, then what is the plight of translation? Hence, Mrs. Warija ji wrote -

  

'Kendriya atma/ prasanna atma when translated, the context is distorted.'  

  

Cakrapanidatta, on commenting above clarifies to remove confusion - आत्मा नाम शरीरमित्यर्थः । Indeed, Kendriya atma is not part of Sushruta's lakshanam. Sometimes, a term like हृदयम् intended to convey the meaning of 'मनस्' as referred by Acharyas. Only a Sanskrit commentary helps one in grasping real contextual meaning.

  

Distortions in translations could be either intentional or unintentional.

  

Thanks!
