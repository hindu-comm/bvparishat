I was trying to translate a Malayalam Shiva Stuti into English. I couldn't make much sense of a stanza in the stuti. Especially the term "Paramārga" and the verb "dhīramākkum", i.e., to make "dhīram". But what does "dhīram" mean here?

  

*Parannīṭum prapañcattil*

*Pakal rātrikaḷe cērttu*

*Paramārgam dhīramākkum*

*Paramēśā toẓunnēn*

  

പരന്നീടും പ്രപഞ്ചത്തിൽ

പകൽരാത്രികളെ ചേർത്തു

പരമാർഗ്ഗം ധീരമാക്കും

പരമേശാതൊഴുന്നേൻ

  

My translation is as follows:

  

Parannīṭum = spreading extensively = vast.

Prapañcam = world.

Prapañcattil = in the world.

Pakal = day. 

Rātri = night.

Pakalrātrikaḷ = days and nights

Cērttu = having joined, added. 

Paramārgam = ?? the spiritual way ? 

Dhīramākkum = ?? make easy ? Make steady? What does Dhīra mean here?

Paramēśā = O Supreme God. 

Toẓunnēn = I salute.  

  

O Supreme God, thou who hast made the spiritual path easy by appointing day and night in this vast world, I offer my salutations to thee! 

  

How does appointing day and night in the vast world make the spiritual path easy? What is the significance of days and nights (pakal - rātrikal)?

  

Thanks and regards,

Radhakrishna Warrier
