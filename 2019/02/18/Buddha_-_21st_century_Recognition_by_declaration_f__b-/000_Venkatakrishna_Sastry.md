Namaste

  

1\.  I draw the attention of the scholars here to the Statement by World Buddhism Association Headquarters .

  

  -The media version is at url:
<https://www.washingtontimes.com/sponsored/statement-world-buddhism-association-headquarters/>.

  -The original statement is accessible at <https://www.wbahq.org>.


  

The media report focuses on the socio-political environment.

The original website focuses on the ' recognition and certification of BUDDHA, (and not Bodhisattva).. 

  

2\.  Understanding 'Buddha' in the context of Bharateeya Darshanas is a highly disputed issue.

  

   At one end, we have 'Buddha- Shakya Muni / Gautama Buddha / Siddhartha, as a propagator of 'Nastika Darshana / Main opponent of 
Vaidika yajna - Vedanta- Advaita position'.

   On the other end we have ' Buddha- one of the Ten Avatara's of Vishnu with a specified purpose'.

  Socially - political-religions wise, Buddhism is separate world religion, albeit its Indian origin.

  

3. I wish to draw scholars attention is the following segment, a focus on ' ORIGINAL LANGUAGE TRANSLATION- TRANSMISSION - TEACHING ADAPTATIONS of (Buddhist SUTRA ) TEXT'  in the original web site:

  

\<Since Sakyamuni Buddha, the Buddhist Lord of the Saha World, established Buddhism in our world over 2500 years ago, much of the Buddhaâ€™s teachings and dharma were recorded and kept in various forms till now, which are the Buddhist sutra's as people know them. The doctrines and meanings in the Buddhist sutras are followed by Buddhists in the whole world. However, due to the differences in the lineage of teaching by the patriarchs from different sects, as well as the errors created when Buddhist sutras were translated to other languages, some of the doctrines and meanings of Buddhism passed down today have deviated from the teachings of Namo Sakyamuni Buddha and all Buddhas in the ten directions in terms of the understanding and views as well as the ways to practice and learn them. \>

  

4\.   Those who have other interest, especially on the ' NEW AVATAR'
of BUDDHA can explore the following part of WEB-statement:

  

\< Fortunately, Namo H.H. Dorje Chang Buddha III is now abiding in the Saha world, the world of ours. Namo H.H. Dorje Chang Buddha III is of great loving kindness and great compassion. He is benevolent, kind, and moral. **He is the only one in the world who is recognized and certified as a Buddha by the leaders and great rinpoches of all the major Buddhist sects, and the only one who has received the most and the highest recognition and certifications as a Buddha.** Moreover, the achievements in the Five Vidyas by H.H. Dorje Chang Buddha III are the highest and the most perfect in the entire Buddhist history.Therefore, H.H. Dorje Chang Buddha III is the highest Buddhist leader in our world. >

  

The dialogue on this position of World Buddhissm association can trigger a global debate and impact of it can be on Hinduism in untold dimensions.
