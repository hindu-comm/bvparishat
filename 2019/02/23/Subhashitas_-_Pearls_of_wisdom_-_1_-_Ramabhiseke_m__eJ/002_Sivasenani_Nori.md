Sir

  

Could it be that the madavihvalaa version is hinting at a celebration the earlier night, and, ahem, one drink too many?

  

The indication of the omen which comes to foreground in your interpretation, is of course more profound and purposeful.

  

Or, if we are to speculate, the madavihvalaa version might have been composed by the poet in his youth and slightly changed in a later recounting.

  

I enjoyed both the versions, though.

  

Regards

N Siva Senani
