The text of the verse that I like is:

  

रामाभिषेके जलमाहरन्त्या हस्ताच्च्युतो हेम-घटो युवत्या: /

सोपान-मार्गेण करोति शब्दं ठठं ठठण्ठं ठठठं ठठण्ठ: //

  

A pitcher of sacred water falling from the hand of an otherwise able attendant is a bad omen suggesting that Rama's crowning will not ultimately take place.

  

How are abhiṣeka and mada-vihvala to be reconciled?

  

I could not get Dr. Satyavathi’s reading in the place of ठठठं with certainty.

  

Thanks to her and you for reminding me of a charming, suggestive verse that at the same time meets a difficult challenge (as Dr. Satyavathi rightly observes ).

  

a.a.
