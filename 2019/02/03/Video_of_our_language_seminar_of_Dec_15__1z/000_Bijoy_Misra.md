Dear friends,

  

Good morning.

I am giving below the link to the youtube post of our Language Research

Seminar held on Dec 15. The total tape is 2hr 45 min. We kept the discussions

for historical reference. The material spans many fields. There are three

speakers: Mr Prem Nagar from Oracle corp, Dr Bela Kosaras from Harvard

Medical School and I. Hope many of you would find time to view it in leisure.  

Please feel free to send me comments. Our goal is to engage more people  

into the study of the science of human speech and language generation.
I had

posted my portion earlier and am grateful for the positive comments.
