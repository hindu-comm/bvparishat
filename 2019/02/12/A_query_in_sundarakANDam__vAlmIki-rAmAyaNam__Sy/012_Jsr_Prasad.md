While appreciating your rationale, let me add these observations:

Dhanyamalini's name appears at 5.22.39, I too was confused thinking, who this character could be. Later, at 5.58.75, Maharshi clarifies through Hanuman that this is a synonym of Mandodari. Probably it slipped our attention? I am yet to see what happened to 'Dundubhi.'

I was wondering, what is the purpose of adjectives he used '*चतुर्भिः* मन्त्रितत्त्वज्ञैः' and '*पञ्च*सेनाग्रनायकान् etc. He was specific about those numbers while using the noun दुर्धर/दुर्धर्ष।

'pardonable' is a big word, unless genuine slips are identified. Can you please share what sorts of discrepancies are unveiled by commentators.

  

Thanks
