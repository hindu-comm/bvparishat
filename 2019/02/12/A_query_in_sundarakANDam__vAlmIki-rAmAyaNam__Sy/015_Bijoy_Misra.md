"critical review" is a western concept to map material to a reference frame.

We use words when we fail to "map" as though a creative work must be mapped.

This is true with all poetic works that have been labelled as "myth" etc.

In stead comparing to a local frame, I have felt that we analyze the creativity

in the associated time and space that we try to reconstruct. I think this would be true

for all social conditions, human rights, belief systems and relationship issues.  

In my view, all labels are political. Adjectives flow freely in the west!

Religious scholars do commentaries to force conclusions, but i would recommend

all to read original and map fresh with your skills. It is same as reading the text

using a dictionary! There is no one-to-one meaning of an acoustic signal!

It is always in context. Phrased words are artificial!

There is a huge analytic literature in Indian tradition on Word! Needs serious study.
