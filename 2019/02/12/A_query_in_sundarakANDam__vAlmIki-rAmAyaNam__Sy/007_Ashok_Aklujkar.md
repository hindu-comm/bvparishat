Dear Bijoy,

  

The verse has a symmetry\*: each noun is accompanied by an adjective (or a functionally adjectival noun)•• in each of its four quarters. Since prahasta is unlikely to be an adjective (as I recall, it occurs as a name of a rakṣas/rākṣasa elsewhere in the Rāmāyaṇa), durdhara is more likely to have been intended as an adjective in the first quarter.

  

\*Classical Skt poets are fond of introducing symmetries. The Sundara-kāṇḍa of the Rāmāyaṇa is particularly close to Classical Skt poetry as its name suggests.

  

••The dividing line between substantives and adjectives is thin in many Indo-European languages. Such is particularly the case in Skt.
