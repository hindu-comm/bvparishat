Dear Mishra sir,

I am not working for any particular research topic. Our team is working for a Ramayana project. While working on sundararakanda I had doubt about 'durdhara', as the discussion continued I was enthusiastic about the topic. Else that was not for any exact reason.

However I thank one and all of the group members for sharing their views.

Regards.

Arjun Kashyap.
