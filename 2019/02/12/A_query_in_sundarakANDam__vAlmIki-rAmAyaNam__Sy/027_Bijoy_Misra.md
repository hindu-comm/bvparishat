Dear Dr Kashyap,  

I assume you have a good command of Sanskrit grammar.

You would need that to analyze the text. Please don't skim anything.

Go slow and make the reconstruction. Give it time.  

Be thorough, don't assume anything. Remain totally focused on Valmiki for five years.  

Your work will add substantially to the research methodology in textual analysis.

You can communicate to me privately as you proceed.

Best wishes,

BM
