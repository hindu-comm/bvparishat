If the doubt is how a dead "Durdhara" came back again, all that I can say that there are similar discrepancies in the epic which might have been discussed in this forum earlier. Mayavi/Dundubhi and dhanyamalini/mandodari.

If I could hazard an explanation, which may be against tradition, it is as follows: The poet(Not necessarily Valmiki the sage-poet in the story) might have slipped up and forgotten. Ifwe imagine he was writing on bhurjapatraor talapatra, he might have taken several years to complete the epic of 24000 verses over a thousand or more leaves. It would not be easy to cross check what he had written earlier. He has done a fantastic job in maintaining the integrity of the story and such very few slips are pardonable.

Commentators have noticed these discrepancies. Their explanation is "same name but different person". or they say, "saamaharshehSailI" !.

Regards,

Murthy
