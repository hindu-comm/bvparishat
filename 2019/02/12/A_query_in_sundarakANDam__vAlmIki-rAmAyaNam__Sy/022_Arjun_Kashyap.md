Dear prasad ji,

My doubt was not about the scribal time or era of Valmiki Ramayan.

When was Valmiki Ramayana published as book for the first time.

As the intro part of Vadodara critical edition refers; The Valmiki Ramayana has more than 2000 manuscripts, in which 86 mss were selected for the critical study and 37 mss belonging to different recensions were took for the Critical edition (if wrong kindly correct me).

So who or which publisher firstly published VR as a book.

Regards.

Arjun Kashyap (Ph. D.)
