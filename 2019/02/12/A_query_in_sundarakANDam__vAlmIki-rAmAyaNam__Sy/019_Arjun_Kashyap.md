I thank all the scholars for such an informative discussion on this topic.

As quoted by Murthy ji'  

  

"Ifwe imagine he was writing on bhurjapatraor talapatra, he might have taken several years to complete the epic of 24000 verses over a thousand or more leaves."  

  

1\. For my curiosity I would like to know if Maharṣi Vālmīki wrote the entire Rāmāyaṇa on birch bark or palm leaf codex, what might be the **script** written by the seer?

(As for today, we date all the scripts; even Brāhmī, Khraoṣṭhī, Śaradā etc. till 6th or 7th Century BCE.)

  

2\. And when was Rāmāyaṇa printed and published for the first time?

  

3.If Vālmīki would have taken several years to complete the epic of 24000 verses, How many years would Maharṣi Vyāsa took to compose/write/dictate the all 18 Purāṇas? The Mahāhārata alone contains 1 lakh verses and the Liṅga Purāṇa probably 81,000 verses.

  

I would be really blessed to get some information on this!
