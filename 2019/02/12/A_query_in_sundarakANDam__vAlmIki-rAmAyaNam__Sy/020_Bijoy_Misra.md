The current speculation is that the material was orally composed and maintained through bards who rendered the material

in public performances. There appears to be a continuing tradition of performing arts in old India (like now) as a part of

social and religious events.

More thorough research need be undertaken. We need to know Valmiki's time, schooling, his social conduct,

his students and if he was a bard himself. I am not aware of work in this direction.
