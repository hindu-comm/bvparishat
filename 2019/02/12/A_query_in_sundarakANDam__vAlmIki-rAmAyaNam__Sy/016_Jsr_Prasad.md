Dear Sir,

  

Thanks. I think, these examples can not withstand as some discrepancies in VR.  

  

Because, seemingly Govindaraja is not sure, whether it is brother of Dundubhi or Eldest son of him or the younger one. Also, the full paada need to be quoted for 4.9.4 - *मायावी नाम तेजस्वी* पूर्वजो दुन्दुभेः सुतः।   

  

The other example shown on discrepancy at 5.58.75 is - तीर्थः : पूर्वं धान्यमालिन्या प्रतिषिद्ध इत्युक्तम् । इदानीं मण्डोदरीत्यभिधानात् *उभाभ्यामपि* इति कल्पनीयम् ।  

  

But you missed out subsequent line - यद्वा मन्दोदर्या एव नामान्तरं धान्यमालिनीत्युक्तम् ।।  

  

So, commentators themselves are unsure of what they argue. How can we see them as discrepancies.

  

Regards
