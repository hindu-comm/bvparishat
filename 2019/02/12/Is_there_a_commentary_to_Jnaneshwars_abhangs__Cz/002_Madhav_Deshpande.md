Dear Shri Subrahmanian,

  

  As you can see from this web-page \[<https://www.jiosaavn.com/lyrics/Kanada-Raja-Pandharicha-Lyrics/Rjgjdzxhbmc>\], this Abhanga is a modern Marathi composition by the well known poet G. D. Madgulkar \[ग. दि. माडगूळकर\] and put to music by Sudhir Phadke and Vasantrao Deshpande. The translation you found is close enough. It is a song glorifying the Viṭṭhala of Pandharpur and his affectionate relationship to his devotees like Namdev, Chokhoba, Purandar and Damaji Pant. This song is very popular in Maharashtra and evokes deep religious sentiments among listeners. Many recordings are available on the YouTube. With best wishes,
