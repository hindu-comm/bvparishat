In the general Marathi population, knowledge of Sanskrit is not very wide spread and singing Sanskrit songs is not very common. On the other hand, the Abhangas, of old saints and modern compositions, and Marathi Gīta-Rāmāyaṇa of Madgulkar and Marathi Bhakti songs in general are very popular and they reach the entire range of the population.
