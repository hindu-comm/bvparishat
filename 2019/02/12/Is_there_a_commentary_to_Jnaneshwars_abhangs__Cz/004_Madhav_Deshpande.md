The verse

निराकार तो निर्गुण ईश्वर  
असा प्रकटला असा विटेवर  
उभय ठेविले हात कटीवर  
पुतळा चैतन्याचा

attempts to reconcile the nirgūna nature of God with his saguṇa appearance in the form of Viṭṭhala in Pandharpur. This is something like arcāvatāra. The physical image of Viṭṭhala \[putal̥ā\] is described as consciousness incarnate, linking the saguṇa form with the nature of God as चैतन्य. It is a very beautiful song. Last week, I heard \[here in San Jose, California\] a rendering of this song in a Marathi movie \[भाई\] on the life of the Marathi author, actor, dramatist, musician, comedian Shri Pu. La. Deshpande.
