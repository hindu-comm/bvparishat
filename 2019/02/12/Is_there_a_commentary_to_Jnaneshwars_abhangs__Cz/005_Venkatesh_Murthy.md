Namaste

  

There is a Panduranga Ashtaka written by Adi Sankaracharya -

  

<http://greenmesg.org/mantras_slokas/sri_krishna-pandurangashtakam.php>

  

Is this popular among Marathi speaking people? I have not heard this much from them. Many Abhangs but not this Stotra. In this he has clearly said परं त्विष्टिकायां समन्यस्तपादं andप्रमाणं भवाब्धेरिदं मामकानां नितम्बः कराभ्यां धृतो येन तस्मात्- very special features of Vitthala.
