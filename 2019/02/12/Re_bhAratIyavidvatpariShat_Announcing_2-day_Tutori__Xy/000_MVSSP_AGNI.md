Sir,

  Sorry to say but The registration fee is too much sir. For 2 days its 4800. Although iam interested to attend the session because of this fee i cant even dare to think of it. If sessions like 2 days 4800 fee goes on due to expense issue also many students dont show interest towards it. Its not difficult for the persons who earns 1 lakh or above per month but for normal sanskrit students and sanskrit teachers or faculty who works on contract basis will not get an get an opportunity to attend these sessions. If the fee is less i feel many students show interest to attend sessions. So i request scholars to think on this fee issue also.

If any thing wrong in my words please pardon. 



          Thank you
