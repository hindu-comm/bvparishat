Thanks. This list of 50 most frequent verbs is very useful. There should be a statistical way to figure out core and marginal vocabulary.
Ttahe core vocabulary should form the basis of beginning teaching materials. In my Saṃskr̥ta-Subodhinī, I have done it rather intuitively. But there may be a more scientific way of doing it with tools like the ones you have provided. With best wishes,
