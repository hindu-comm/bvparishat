Mridula ji,

If this human performed Tyagaraja Kruti, [*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaOckrVCVoI*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaOckrVCVoI)
is soul-stirring for us, believe me, definitely mechanized AI generated Indian classical music would also be soul-stirring for us. The only caveat here is, we should adopt the paradigm of “only change is constant”. AI-Indian Classical Music would be a new genre in the music world. Let’s welcome it!
