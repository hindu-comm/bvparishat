About the Trainer:

  

Prof. Vinod Vidwans has a PhD from IIT Bombay on Creativity as Design Intelligence. He is a multifaceted person commanding skills in fine arts such as Painting, Calligraphy, Hindustani Music, Graphic Design, User Interface Design, New Media design etc. on the one hand and skills in computer coding particularly in the areas of language technologies, web development, Artificial Intelligence etc. on the other. He is passionate about the theoretical knowledge embedded in ancient Indian Shastras such as VyaakaraNa, Yoga, Alankaarashaastra, sangeetashaastra, naaTyashaastra etc. along with practical aspects of them.

  

To know more about him, please visit:

Combining all these skills and knowledges, he did experiments in imparting creativity to machine, i.e., computer.

  

About the Workshop

  

He created an AI creative expert system which makes a computer perform classical Indian concert on its own, like a creative human musician does. He created the system using the description and analysis of classical Indian music in the ancient treatises such as Naradiya Shiksha, Natya Shastra of Bharata, and Sangeet Ratnakar of Sharanga Deva. By doing this, he proved that these shastras have computationally significant and exhaustive description and analysis of music.

  

Through this workshop, he would like to pass on this understanding of him about the computational aspects of sangeetashastra i.e., the traditional musicology of Indian classical music to musicians and musicologists and students, researchers and professionals of computer science including the area of Artificial Intelligence.

  

Musicians and musicologists of Indian classical music shall be introduced to the necessary fundamentals of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence. IT professionals, students, researchers and professionals of computer science shall be introduced to the necessary fundamentals of sangeetashastra, i.e., traditional musicology of Indian classical music. Both shall be introduced to modelling Sangeeta shaastra for AI and in creating a musician computer in this workshop.

  

The workshop is for:

  

-   Musicologists, music researchers, students of music and performing
    arts

-   Engineers, technocrats, IT professionals, and
    scientists/mathematicians interested in Indic themes

-   Computer scientists with expertise in modeling

-   Performing artists with interest in theoretical knowledge

-   Scholars in Indic studies with interest in media, communication and
    aesthetics

-   Inter-disciplinary experts in diverse areas interested in Indian
    music and recent developments in computer science

  

Participants do not need any prior specific technical or software skills.

  

Note: Participants need to bring their own laptops. Systems will need Windows 7 or higher system on the computers/ laptops.
