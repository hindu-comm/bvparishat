Respected scholars,

  

Namaste.

  

This workshop would indeed be a path-breaking endeavor in bringing Sangeetha-Shaastra and technology together.  

But I have a few questions: What may be the utility of AI being able to perform creative Indian classical music, as it is more enjoyable and soul-stirring when it is performed by a human? I understand that this is a naive question to ask, but, are we not pushing out the human aspect from our lives gradually, by mechanizing everything, including artistic experiences? I request our esteemed scholars to kindly enlighten me on this, in light of AI not only w.r.t music, but as a whole. Does it really serve human intellectual and spiritual development? Our Shaastras have the purushaartha concept as their core, and can AI be justified from this perspective?

  

Regards,
