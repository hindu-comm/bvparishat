Namaste,

  

Further, in the Kannada edition provided, which may be identical with the Venkatesvara Steam Press edition, the last shloka is the following beautiful one from Mokshadharma parva of Mahabharata:

``` tyaja dharmamadharmaM cha ubhe satyAnRRite tyaja | ubhe satyAnRRite tyaktvA yena tyajasi taM tyaja || 
```

``` ```
