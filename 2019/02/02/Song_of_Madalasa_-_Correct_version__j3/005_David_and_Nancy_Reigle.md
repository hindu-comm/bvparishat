Dear Sri Jayaraman,  

  

It does not seem that you have easy access to the critical edition of the Markandeyapuranam. So I have scanned Madalasa's song from it and attached the scan. It is in adhyaya 22 of the critical edition. I had not checked this earlier. The old Bibliotheca Indica edition is where it is in adhyaya 25. It is in adhyaya 23 of the Venkatesvara Steam Press edition. In all three purana editions the first verse sung on the YouTube recording is absent, while the seventh verse found in all three purana editions is absent in the YouTube recording.  

  

Best regards,
