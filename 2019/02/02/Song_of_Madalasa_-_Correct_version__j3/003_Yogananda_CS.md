Namaste Dr. Jayaraman,

  

I checked with the Markandeya Purana from the Sri Jayachamarajendra Granthamaala, in Kannada script (and translation). Except the first shloka others are there, but in the 23rd chapter. Am attaching the pdf. Will try and organise the shlokas in Devanagari for the benefit of other members.

  

regards.......yoga
