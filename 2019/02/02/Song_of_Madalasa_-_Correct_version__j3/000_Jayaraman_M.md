Namaste  

  

There is a youtube video on Song of Madalasa. - <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDd3iupKUyI>  

Inspired by that I was requested by a well-wisher to give the text and translation.  

  

When I started the work I saw that there are variations in versions/translations of the text where I could also see some mistakes. This is based on searching  

[archive.org](http://archive.org). Even in BVP archives I did not find any discussions on this earlier.

  

Where can I get a critically edited version/or a version with Sanskrit commentary of the text (even the scan image of the adhyaya 25 of Markandeya purana - where this song of madalasa occurs would suffice) or atleast a version which has been edited by a scholar?  

  

I look forward to the inputs of the members of the list.
