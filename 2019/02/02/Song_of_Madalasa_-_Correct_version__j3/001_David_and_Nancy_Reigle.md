Dear Sri Jayaraman,

  

Probably someone has already replied to you off list in the last few days, mentioning the critical edition of the Markandeyapuranam. Volume 1 of the critical edition, including adhyayas 1-75, was published in 2011. It was edited by M. L. Wadekar, and published by the Oriental Institute, Vadodara. I hope you can access it somewhere. The adhyaya 25 that you need is short, only five pages.

  

Best regards,

  

David Reigle

Colorado, U.S.A.
