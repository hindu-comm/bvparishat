The so called '1-Day National Seminar' appears to be a quick fix program, to put it mildly. I have nothing personal against, the DoS, Mysore University where my (Late) father was Professor & HoD. I do not know the organizers personally. Hence let none mistake my post. I am anguished by such Seminars that claim to encourage discussions on original research findings (vichaara sankiraNa ವಿಚಾರ ಸಂಕಿರಣ !) on "Water" in Sanskrit texts (Vedas, Upavedas, Kavyas,...). The announcement hints that subjects like earth sciences/geology on water prospecting is outside "Sanskrit Knowledge Tradition". You are supposed to send your original paper, unpublished elsewhere, by10 March that is in about a month. The paper witll be peer reviewed and if selected it will also be printed in the proceedings volume within 20 days with ISBN number! Surely, some Ph.D candidates will be helped to meet the UGC requirement.

This pattern of National/International Conferences, Seminars, Symposia on Sanskrit and Ancient India related subjects fixed and delivered within (15 days to 3 months) is the new "fashion" of original research in the country.  

Cheers !
