Namaste,

  

One immediate response is that one needs to plan such activities much in advance and notify giving enough time for Vidwans to consider it and prepare papers; organisers also need time to get the papers received by them, peer reviewed. A reasonable time frame would be about 4-6 months in advance of the actual dates of the conference / seminar, at least.
