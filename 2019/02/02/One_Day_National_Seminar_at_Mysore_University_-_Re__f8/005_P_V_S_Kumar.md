Iyengar ji,



I can feel your concern about research quality being impacted due to super-compressed timelines.



As Dr. Kannan ji has already stated, availability of little timeframe between the grant of funds and the deadline to submit the expense reports is the main cause for this trend to prevail across universities.



I feel, we need not to worry about this trend for the following reasons:



1.  For serious researchers anyway, there are many other avenues to
    publish their high impact research work

2.  These low budget seminars/conferences, on the other hand, do cater
    to the Ph.D. Students as well as teaching staff to meet the UGC
    stipulated requirements very well

3.  These seminars give an opportunity for teaching staff to look beyond
    the texts and subjects they are regularly teaching. While preparing
    content for a seminar paper, a Sahitya lecturer may refer to
    Jyothisha, Nyaya, Upanishad texts which he may not look into at all
    for his regular class lectures. The new points he comes across
    during the paper preparation would definitely help him enhancing his
    class lectures by giving a better explanation of the niceties in
    complex poetry/prose he is dealing with.

    In this way, the work being done while preparing the seminar paper
    is ‘re-search’ only!

4.  I have seen some scholars who are writing/thinking on various themes
    at any point in time. They prepare subject matter ready for paper
    presentation and keep in their तूणीर \| As and when a conference of
    particular theme comes across he picks up the right arrow and hoots
    at. Short timelines do not matter for them; they only need relevant
    platform to launch their ideas/thoughts. We find such instances also
    in this kind of seminars. 

    

I am sure, most of us will agree that these high beneficial and low impact (due to relatively low quality and limited circulation of their ISBN-ed publications) seminars are helping many of us and UGC is also well aware of this fact.
