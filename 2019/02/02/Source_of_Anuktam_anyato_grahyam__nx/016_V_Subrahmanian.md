There is another related idea: परमतम् अप्रतिषिद्धम् अनुमतम् \| What is non-contradictory (to us) (in another doctrine) is acceptable (to us). Shankaracharya has said this in the Brahma sutra Bhashya. The non-Vedantic doctrines that are refuted by Veda Vyasa are not thrown out wholesale; what is admissible to Vedanta is welcome.
