Prof. Deshpande has drawn our attention to a valuable reference in a valuable work.

I have referred to this nyAya several times. After all, no work can claim to have studied all cases.

  

I guess it is a typo in the Professor's quote. Line 3 reads:

*nyUnAms'a-pUrNArtham*. Could it be  

*nyUnAms'a-pUr**a**NArtham ?  
*
