As rightly hinted at by Prof. Madhav Deshpande, this saying (maxim/dictum) comes in the context of गृह्यप्रयोग / श्रौतप्रयोग. One may get its source /reference in some commentary or in Nibandha work. A similar saying is seen cited in the preface of Mysore edition (1983) of Bodhayana Grhya sutra - स्वसूत्रे विद्यमाने तु परसूत्रेण वर्तते। बोधायनमतं कृत्वा स्वसूत्रफलभाग्भवेत्॥ \[sic\] . "If somebody doesn't know his Svasutra, or if one is unable to perform some rite according to one's own Sutra, then he may perform the same according to Bodhayana Grhya sutra . He is certain to get the same result as he would by performing according to Svasutra" - The purport is something like this.


  

Apastamba does not precribe उदकशान्ति ,  यज्ञोपवीतधारण  (उपनयन ) or
मङ्गल्यसूत्रधारण ( विवाह) in his Grhya sutra. However Apastambins perform these taking cue from Bodhayana and others. Similar cases come under the purview of the saying quoted by Daodar das ji.
