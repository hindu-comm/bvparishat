It is a lokokti which is found in versified forms in some śāstras:

*  
*

*anuktam anyato grāhyaṁ uktaṁ samyak samācaret* (***Sūkṣmāgama***, 15.72)  

**  
**

**Translation**: What has clearly not been mentioned here should be taken from other sources. What has been mentioned here should be nicely carried out.
