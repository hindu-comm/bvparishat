Namaste

  

As explained by others in this thread, this concept is quite popular in all shaastra-s as the logic involved is quite acceptable. It goes by the name 'guNopasamhAra' nyaya in Vedanta. When one has to do a meditation on a particular object/deity/concept, it will be most beneficial if one collects all the attributes stated in all sources pertaining to that meditation/deity/object/concept. एकत्रानुक्तगुणाः अन्यत्रोक्ताश्चेत् तान् उपसंहृत्य उपासने योजयितव्याः \|

  

It is applied in situations such as for instance, while we know there are five elements, pancha bhUtAni, only three are stated in the Chandogya 6th (sadvidyaa chapter). The other two not stated here are to be included from Taittiriya where they are stated.

  

Such instances are indicative of the application of the nyaya under consideration.
