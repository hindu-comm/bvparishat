//The legendary Shatarudriyam, also called Rudra Namakam, Rudradhyaya or simply Rudram, is a series of verses dedicated to Lord Shiva as Rudra. In the Krishna Yajur Veda, Taittiriya Samhita, there are 7 cantos, and 44 prasnams. The Shatarudriyam (Rudram) comes in the 4th canto 5th Prasnam. The chant consists of 11 anuvakams and 1234 padams. This chant is said to have been seen or heard by aghora rishi when he was deep inmediationto Lord Shiva.//

  

//All the rishis of Satya yuga worshiped mahadeva from Agastya, Vashishta, Vishvamitra, Aghora Rshi, Atri, Brighu and so on.//
