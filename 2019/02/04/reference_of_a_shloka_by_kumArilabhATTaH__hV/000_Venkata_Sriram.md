Namaste,

  

I need the source of the below shloka uttered byकुमारिलभाट्टः. Where exactly it occurs.

..............................................................  

स्वकाले यदकुर्वस्तु करोत्यन्यदचेतनः ।

प्रत्यवायोऽस्य तेनैव नाभावेन स जन्यते ॥

................................................................

  

It says:



“Non-performance of obligatory duty (nitya-karma) like sandhyavandana etc. is ‘abhAva’.

Skipping of obligatory duties resulting in pratyavAya-dosha

Is erroneous perception as ‘pratyavAya-dosha’ (sin) is bhAva-rupa

as abhAva can’t yield bhAva.



However, one tends to do ‘anya-karma’ (nishiddha etc.) when one has to

Perform obligatory duties and this rises in pApa.



Thus, performance of ‘anyakarma) (which is bhAva-rupa)

produces the pratyavAya dosha (bhAva-rupa) which is

also logically correct.



rgs,

sriram
