Respected sir,

 I am very happy to see a member of UNESCO in this group. With an interest towards indian culture and being a civil services aspirant i want to know the following details:

1.HOW DO THE UNESCO SELECT " INTANGIBLE CULTURAL HERITAGE "

2.WHAT ARE THE PARAMETERS REQUIRED FOR THE SELECTION?

3\. WHAT IS THE PROCEDURE TO BE FOLLOW FOR THE INCULSION OF AN INTANGIBLE CULTURAL HERITAGE IN TO THE LIST OF UNESCO.

  

In India various intangible cultural heritages such as KOODIYATTAM,
RAMLILA, MUDIYATTU, KALBELIA, CHHAU, TRADITIONAL UTENSIL MAKING OF PUNJAB are recognised by UNESCO.  

  

VEDIC CHANTING,SANKEETANA, BUDDISHT CHANTING OF LADAKH , recntly YOGA and KUMBH MELA are also recognised.

  

I want the traditional " TRETAGNI YAGNA YAGA " system to be included in the list.

The reasons are as follows:

1.The traditional ' TRETAGNI SYSTEM " is preliminary step for the performance of "YAGNA YAGAS"

such as "SOMA YAGA" "VAJAPEYA YAGA" " AGNISTHOMA" " JYOTISTHOMA" etc.

2.These are vedic culture practices still practiced by very less people in india.

3.It is well known to the world that the BHARAT is a KARMA BHOOMI
where only YAGNA YAGAS can be performed.And in this world BHARAT is the only place for these practices.

4.Out of the world population of nearly 500 crores the no.of people performing or having this tradition of " TRETAGNI - YAGNA - YAGA " are nearly around 170.  

5.Only 170 people out of 130 crores of population of the country and 500 crores of world population requires HIGH CARE for the practice being its an old tradition of vedic period.

6.Even the tigers of india which are animals are more than 1000 having high care and laws to protect them but people following some ancient tradition of nearly 4000 years are less than 200 out of 130 crores of population and don't have recognition for the protection of their tradition is a fact.

  

So , i request you to please tell me the procedure to follow to recognise this " TRETAGNI - YAGNA - YAGA " tradition as an INTANGIBLE CULTURAL HERITAGE in the list of UNESCO so that the measures for the protection of this culture to be taken by the UNESCO along with the MEMBER COUNTRIES AND INDIA.

  

 THANKING YOU
