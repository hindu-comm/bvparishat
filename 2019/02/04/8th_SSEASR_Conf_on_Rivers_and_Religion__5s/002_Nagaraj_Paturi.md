# Water and Womanhood: Religious Meanings of Rivers in MaharashtraPaperback– Import, 13 Jul 1995

by[Anne Feldhaus](https://www.amazon.in/Anne-Feldhaus/e/B001H6NYSG/ref=dp_byline_cont_book_1)(Author)

Feldhaus examines the role of certain \`domestic' values in the religious meanings of rivers in Maharashtra, a large region of western India. Feldhaus draws both on written religious texts and on a wide range of oral, iconographic, and ritual materials gathered in the course of field work in India.
