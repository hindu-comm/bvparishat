Dear members of BVP,

  

Here is a clarification from my side regarding the Sri. Vishvas Vasuki's post. His words are perhaps misleading; it gives wrong impressions to the readers. His efforts in propagating our literature are indeed laudable. I wholeheartedly appreciate him for this. As the author (of one book mentioned herein), I have no issues with such endeavours. However, all stake holders have to be duly informed before venturing into such acts. Especially the publishers have to be notified, for they have invested in the publications. The discretion for permitting or otherwise lies with them. Sri. Vishvas doesn't seem to have contacted them, and so I wrote him a personal mail suggesting him to do so. Also, since the recordings were shared on public platforms, there is a huge chance that the copyright holders will see them. The associated legal issues have to be properly taken care of, too.

  

My e-mail to Sri Vishvas was with this concern.

  

Regards,

R. Ganesh
