namaste,

  

A couple of clarifications regarding the below.

  

Copyright concerns:

\- As the author notified us of objections, recordings of ಬ್ರಹ್ಮಪುರಿಯ ಭಿಕ್ಷುಕ were removed from [archive.org](http://archive.org) . ಬ್ರಹ್ಮಪುರಿಯ ಭಿಕ್ಷುಕ is a great book - I encourage you to buy and read the book to sample some wonderful instances of DVG's life.  

\- DVG's works remain in copyright for 6 more years (AFAIU). I have written to GIPA requesting permission to continue sharing the audio recordings in the meantime.

\- I frankly did not think of copyright problems beforehand; neither did I think that the authors might object. If there are other objections, notify us know offline. My prior assumption that authors will generally be happy with the spread of their ideas to people who would not even consider their works otherwise due to lack of time and knowledge remains.  

\- As the revered rangapriyasvAmI was a sannyAsin, who owned no property (including copyright) - I don't know who to ask. If shrI KS kaNNan can get us permission or point us in the right direction, we'd be grateful.  

  

Quality concerns:

- People with refined taste may find the recordings too sub-par. Others (such as myself) may nevertheless find great enjoyment and edification from the recordings. So, kindly consume with discretion. No force! If you have the time and inclination - the original printed books might be the best.  

\- These recordings are not "authoritative editions" of the corresponding books. They're informal recordings.

\- As is my habit, I listened to these recordings at 2x speed (except rare places where I needed to listen slowly). However some people find 1.5x speed too fast. So, please note that recordings at normal speed are also available - just remove the final 1.5x from the URL. For example, use <https://archive.org/details/bhAratIya-habba-AcharaNegaLu-rangapriya-swamy> instead of <https://archive.org/details/bhAratIya-habba-AcharaNegaLu-rangapriya-swamy-1.5x>.
