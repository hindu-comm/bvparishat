#### Esteemed Scholars,

#### 

I am exploring if there is any connection between the rise of Hindu powers in the 18thcentury like Marathas and Jats and vernacular commentarieson theRamayana.

Eknathain his Marathi 'Bhavartha Ramayana' seems to be urging the people to unite to release the Gods from the custody.

Thanking in advance.
