Mahadev Govind Ranade in his "Rise of Maratha Power" (1900) andG. B. Sardar in his book "The Saint-Poets of Maharashtra: Their Impact on Society (*in English*) (1969)" have discussed the contribution of Marathi saints to the emergence of a feeling of religious nationalism that may have contributed to the rise of Shivaji. Other historians like V. K. Rajwade have contested this proposition, claiming that the saints created a sense of passivity and dependence upon god. This debate has a long history. The more popular view is that Shivaji's mother Jijabai told him stories of the epics and that inspired him to rise in resistance to the Muslim powers. Again credit is given by some historians to saint Ramdas for inspiring Shivaji, but this is contested in the current anti-Brahmin politics of Maharashtra by groups like the Sambhaji Brigade.
