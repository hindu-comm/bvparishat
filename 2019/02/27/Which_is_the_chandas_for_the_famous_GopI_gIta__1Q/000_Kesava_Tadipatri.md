Namaste.  
  
 What is the Chandas/meter for the famous GopI gIta in Bhagavata  
which goes like -  
  
jayati te.adhikaM janmanA vrajaH shrayata indirA sAdhu tatra hi \|  
dayita dR^ishyatAM tvAM didR^ikShatAM tvayi dhR^itAsavastvAM vichinvate  
\|\| 10-29-1\|\|  
  
vrajajanArtihan vIra yoShitAM nijajanasmayadhvaMsanasmita \|  
bhaja sakhe bhave kiN^karIssma no jalaruhAnanaM chAru darshayan \|\| 10-29-2\|\|  
  
This is in triShTup - with gaNas - na, ra, ya, la, ga  
  
What is the specific name for this chandas?  
  
There is a variation of this, which is pankti and instead of na gaNa, it  
has a guruvu and laghuvu and so it ends up  
with the gaNas - ra, ya, ja, ga  
  
What is the specific name for this chandas?  
  
Thanks and regards,  
Kesava Tadipatri
