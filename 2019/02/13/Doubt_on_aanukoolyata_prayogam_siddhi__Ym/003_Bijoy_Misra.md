Dear Prof Korada,

  

The way I have tried to think the difference as the difference in concept property vs object property.

सुन्दरता connects to an object, is manifested, measurable.

सौन्दर्य is analog, a mental construct, only imagined.

  

पण्डित (word) has only पाण्डित्य, an asymptotic concept.

  

I reinforce myself through the use in literature.

May only be poetic!
