Namaste,

  

The arghya during prAtaH sandhya should be offered in standing position. Also, the japa should be done while standing only.

  

1\) Now, while offering arghya, obviously one stands. However, the positioning of the hands from the ground should be such that approximately that of the height of the cow till it's horns. One should neither raise the hands too high nor too low. It is just an approximately height. Now, the ideal place to do sandhya is in the river by performing nAdi-snAna.

  

Earlier, people used to do mrittika-snAna also with aghamarshana sukta.
Now, everything is gone ...thx to municipal taps and perfumed soaps :))

  

So, arghya should be offered in the water itself after mArjana. In gauNa-pakSa, it can be offered at clean place just as we do our sandhya in flats and offer sandhya in our terrace.

  

2\) The arghya should be offered with water in open palms ie., joining both the hands side by side with open palms and throwing the udaka upwards

  

3\) When the thumb & index finger is joined during arghya, it becomes 'rAkSasi-mudra' and the water (udaka / toyaM) thus offered with 'rAkSasi-mudra' becomes equivalent to blood. So, arghya should never be offered with 'rAkSasi-mudra'.

  

Hope it is clear.

  

rgs,

sriram
