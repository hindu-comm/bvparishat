नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

A suggestion -- see that you spell the terms correctly -- अर्घ्यम् etc

  

\>1st sloka speaks about how much the argya water is to be thrown upward ( cow's horn) as per sruti vakya आप ऊर्ध्वं विक्षिपन्ति (kyv aruna 2nd chapter,2nd anuvakam)

Whether this argyam water can fall in water( like if you are doing in nadhi) or it should fall in bhoomi in a clean place? \<

  

Yes , water can fall in water - when you do सन्ध्यावन्दनम् in a नदी ( उपस्थानम् should be on the shore) in waistdeep water you can throw in water , if it is on the floor see it is clean.

  

\>2nd sloka 4th paada tells mudra should not be done\<

  

This aspect of मुद्रा is discussed earlier - it is prescribed in विश्वामित्रस्मृति - मुद्राः are not necessary - some people

are doing .

  

\>3rd sloka says if you join thumb & index finger it becomes rakshasa mudra and it equals to the blood.

Is it because the argyam becomes vajraayudham and hence it becomes blood.. Or since it becomes blood we should not give argya with thumb & index joined together? \<

  

Offer अर्घ्यम् with अञ्जलि -- ’तत्तोयं रुधिरं भवेत् ’ - is an अर्थवाद -- just like रौरवं नरकं व्रजेत् , it is said simply to refrain one from doing so - do not take the वाच्यार्थ - nothing like that will happen - for प्रवृत्ति there will be स्तुत्यर्थवाद , whereas for निवृत्ति there will be निन्दार्थवाद ।

  

व्याघ्रादिव्यपदेशेन यथा बालो निवर्त्यते ।

**असत्यो’पि** तथा कश्चित् प्रत्यवायो विधीयाते ॥

क्वचित्तत्त्वसमाख्यानं क्रियते स्तुतिनिन्दयोः ।

तत्रापि च प्रवृत्तिश्च निवृत्तिश्चोपदिश्यते ॥ **वाक्यपदीयम् , वाक्यकाण्डः , 321, 324**

  

धन्यो’स्मि
