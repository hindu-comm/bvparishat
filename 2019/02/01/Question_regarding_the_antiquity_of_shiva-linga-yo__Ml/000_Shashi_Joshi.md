Namaste.

I want to find out how old is the specific shiva-linga-yoni icon - that we pray to in temples/homes?

Where is it first referred to in shAstra-s?

Is it Vedic time?

I am not referring to the concept of shiva-linga as the pillar of light etc, but the specific iconography of shiva-linga-yoni.

  

  

Apart from that, an article<http://www.indictoday.com/thoughts/what-is-a-lingam/> implies that 1 and 0 as the numbers are refered to the shiva-linga-yoni icon/statue/mUrti.

But the concepts of shiva and shakti, shUnya and ananta were not 1 and 0 (or \| and O), these came later.

So, is the shiva-linga-yoni icon inspired by the specific shape of the symbols for 1 and 0, as claimed?

  

I feel it is just about the generative power that shiva and shakti represent, and there is nothing to feel embarrassed at all about it being just that. This may be also due to my ignorance on the shAstrika background of it.

  

DhanyavAda.  

  
  

Thanks,
