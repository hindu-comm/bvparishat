Namaste,

  

This book has already been discussed on BVP -<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/bvparishat/wf5-1XSBjrM/GaSzIlUjCwAJ>

  

A quick search led me to a copy cataloged in the National Library -<http://nationallibrary.gov.in/showdetails.php?id=561294>

  

While the publishers list this book as 'unavailable' on their website, there are others books available by the same author that you may be interested in:<http://www.conceptpub.com/servlet/Detail?bookno=00000126> Writing to the publisher/ calling them might give way to some solid leads.

  

Writing to a faculty member of the Panjab University's Department of Sanskrit -<http://sanskrit.puchd.ac.in/show-faculty.php> may be of help since Prof. Ram Gopal is stated to work / have worked there.

  

The Library System page of MD University Rohtak lists a copy too -<http://opac.mdurtk.in:8380/opac/browse/browse.html?browseType=2&key=Vaidic+evam+vedantar+Bharatiya-sanskriti&sortByVal=--Select--&bcat=2&db=5&browse_siteId=99&tokenId=I0E5U6Y3Y0J3Y8V2>

  

Hope these are of help. Good luck to you!

  

Regards,

DIvya
