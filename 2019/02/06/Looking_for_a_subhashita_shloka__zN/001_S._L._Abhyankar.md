One of the nine methods of devotion is आत्मनिवेदनम्, which includes confession.

There is no question of one method of devotion being better than another, much less, the best.

In श्रीमद्भागवतम् all nine methods are mentioned as

श्रवणं कीर्तनं विष्णोः स्मरणं पादसेवनम् \|

अर्चनं वन्दनं दास्यं सख्यमात्मनिवेदनम् \|\|7'5'23\|\|
