Indian confession can not be expected to match with the institution of Catholic church, wherein one confesses on Sunday and starts sinning from Monday onwards till next Sunday; it can go on and on. We can't cheat God.  
  
A true confessor, therefore, can not seek redemption for the future sins also.  
  
Therefore, it is prayed that दोष committed in the past are be pardoned with a sincere intention not to fall prey to माया again and again. To err is human, but to err again and again is demoniac. Thus, अज्ञानिना मया दोषानशेषान्विहितान् हरे। क्षमस्व त्वं क्षमस्व त्वं शेषशैलशिखामणे।। is apt and a reasonable prayer of confession.
