Respected Scholars,

Please find enclosed screen shot of a Google search result for " Books on Vedas" .. while it is believed that Vedas are apaurishiya, such search results ( with title as Author of Rig Veda)) may mislead new learners ..Wanted to bring this to notice in this group and also check if this can be corrected ?

  

Thanks

Hamsa
