Namaste,

  

I was studying the 'Mahamopadhyaya Jha Commemoration Volume" of Prof.Bhandarkar. An article glued my eyes.

  

It is about the location of Dandakaranya, the great forest mentioned in Ramayana. The historian concludes the presence of this forest to be

in Maharashtra and in the vicinity of Nasik.

The article is found from pages 174 to 184 of the PDF document.

  

Are there similar historical papers presented supporting the 'bhadrachalam' of Andhra Pradesh

  

rgs,
