Friends,

  

Valmiki does talk about multi-story houses. In Ayodhya, they sounded like

hyperbole. In Lanka, women are jumping from tall buildings with babies in arms

as part of Lanka burning.  

  

Two questions:

  

1. Any reference of tall buildings in Mahabharata

2. Any research on carpentry and building construction in ancient times.

 (indus Period shows two story brick houses)

  

Thank you for your help.
