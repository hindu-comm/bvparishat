Dear Dr. Ashokji,

I must agree with you on Alakshendra since there is no reference to such a name in ancient Indian texts, at least to my knowledge. Even if we do not accept the supposed conquest of Western India by Alexander, a comparative study of Indo European Languages continues to attract scholars. Do we have a new light (in the past 5 years or so) on the original home of the people who spoke the proto Indo European ?

with regards,

ramaratnam
