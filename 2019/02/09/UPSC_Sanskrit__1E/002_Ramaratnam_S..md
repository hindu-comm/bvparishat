Please bear with me,Sirs, for deviating from the main link which is about UPSC. The name Alakshendra is quite fascinating. The word Indra becomes Indar or Inder even in India, on account of the linguistic principle of metathesis and therefore, one can expect it to happen in the Indo European languages of Europe also. Has Alakshedra given rise to Alexander? Are they cognates?
