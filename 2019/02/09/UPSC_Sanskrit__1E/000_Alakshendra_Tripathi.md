Namaste,

  

Recently threads on self-publishing (<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/bvparishat/v_eiClV5nUU/5ni5KgEpBAAJ>) and Sastra-wise networks (<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/bvparishat/Q9141jlDtdo/GeGb5ZLXFwAJ>) were posted in the group.

  

Can't this be utilised by the savant members of the Parishad to create an authority book for the UPSC Sanskrit Optional Subject? There is a serious dearth of a book curated for CSE preparation as far as Sanskrit as an optional goes.

  

This forum has grammarians, linguists, experts on Poetics & Literature and Indian Philosophy. A collaborative work can immensely help an aspirant like me.

  

Thanks and best regards,

Alakshendra Tripathi
