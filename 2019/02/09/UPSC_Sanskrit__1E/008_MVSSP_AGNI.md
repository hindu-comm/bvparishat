If you are unaware of books then please refer the blog of shashank tripathi. There exists a telegram group for upsc sanskrit join in that there you can get list of books along with pdfs. In youtube the grammatical part i.e. sansdhi,samasa and karaka are available. Vachya parivartan is also available in you tube. For history of sanskrit literature you can prefer books as suggested by the coaching institution and those books will be available for you in pdf format from telegram group. For the darsana portion get the notes from philosophy optional students. MITRA IAS indian philosophy will be helpful for you. General essay there exists a book by CHAUKHAMBHA prakashan namely SAMSKRUTA NIBANDHA SATAKAM in which nearly upsc 100 essays of sanskrit optional will be available. I feel there is no need of material for comprehension part ..

Coming to the paper 2 there exists a material i.e. notes of shashank tripathi in his blog and in telegram group also for group-c & group-d portion. For group -a and group- b HISTORY OF SANSKRIT LITERATURE IS fine.  



I feel all the required materials are available for you at now. If you still feels something is missing then ask here. I will give information of them.
