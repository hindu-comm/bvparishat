It's happy to see another aspirant of upsc here. Coming to the material for exam absolutely it's available but not in a single book but in different no.of books by different publishers. I feel instead of troubling them to compile a material let us create and publish our own book.

Even iam ready to try this but I stopped and planned to do it in future after qualifying UPSC. If you are keen in a compilation for UPSC Let us do it. In case of any doubt there are several scholars are present who can guide us. In this group several scholars are working very hard in the Sanskrit and they are promoting the Sanskrit honestly. The time is precious for them. Instead of writing a new book it's easy for them to guide us . For some parts of syllabus we need guidance of them.

Some parts of Sanskrit syllabus we can take the help of young scholars of this group also . There is an on going discussion on women in shastra sadas recently. So if those research scholars also show interest in this we have women empowerment on both sides UPSC & SANSKRIT. The direct involvement of a Sanskrit scholar in UPSC Sanskrit literature gives an upper hand for the present Sanskrit students to choose UPSC as a career too. Or they may take the faculty position for UPSC coaching of Sanskrit literature. So I suggest for "SAHA VEERYAM KARAVA VAHAI". 

I need suggestions of scholars of this group on this .

So i request the scholars of the group b.v.o. for suggestions. And the opinion of young scholars who are interested in this is also required. So that we can plan . "Asaadhana vittahinaha ----------------sadhayantyasu karyani kaka kurma mrugakhavat." - Panchatantra.

So request for the co ordination of the group .

  

Thank you.
