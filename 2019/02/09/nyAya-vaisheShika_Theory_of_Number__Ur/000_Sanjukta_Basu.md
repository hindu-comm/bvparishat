Respected Scholars,

  

Can anyone of you please explain

  

1\) in which categoryNyāya-Vaiśeṣika would place the mathematical truths, such as 2+2=4?

  

2\) how would theNyāya-Vaiśeṣika explain the knowledge of "2+2=4" through pancavayavi nyaya?

  

  

Please consider this as very urgent.

  

Deepest Regards and pranām.
