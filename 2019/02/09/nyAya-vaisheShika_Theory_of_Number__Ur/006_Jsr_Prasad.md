You might be probably referring to Jain works like Ganitasarasamgraha (9th C.) etc. That is a different issue. You asked - 'what is meant by two?'  

  

Indeed, any number starting from 2, is artificial. What causes this cognition is called the 'conjunctive cognition' - apeksha-buddhi. How do we cognize the number '2' is an 8 *kshaNa* process that is described as follows:  

  

आदाविन्द्रियसन्निकर्षघटनादेकत्वसामान्यधी

रेकत्वोभयगोचरामतिरतो द्वित्त्वं ततो जायते ।

द्वित्त्वस्य प्रमितिस्ततोनुपरतः द्वित्त्वप्रमानन्तरं

द्वे द्रव्ये इति धीरियं निगदिता द्वत्त्वोदयप्रक्रिया ।।

  

1\. cognition of contact of sense organs with '2' objects  

2\. cognition of 'ekatva' in an object  

3\. cognition of 'apeksha-buddhi' (conjunctive cognition). In this stage, one cognizes like 'this is one' and 'this is another one' and they are 'two.'  

4\. cognition of 'dvittva'  

5\. cognition of 'dvittva-tva'  

6\. cognition of dvittva as a number  

7\. cognition of duality that exists in two objects  

8\. finally the imagination, 'samskara'

  

The 'duality' exists in two objects with a relation called 'paryaapti.' When the conjunctive cognition is lost, cognition of number is also lost, hence it is relative. It takes the same amount of 'kshNas' for the destruction of the cognition of number.  

  

Concept of number is not only mathematical, but also highly Vedantic in nature looking from a different perspective.
