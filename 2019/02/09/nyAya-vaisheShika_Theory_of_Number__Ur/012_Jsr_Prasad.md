I am not sure, whether you are not referring to Aristotle's 10 categories in context of 'objects.'  

  

However, mental construct is not a problem in Indian philosophy, they agree to it. Grammarians are a better example. For instance, बुद्धिस्थं घटं बाह्यस्थं करोति and so on. Naiayikas are realists, hence, they can not accommodate it.
