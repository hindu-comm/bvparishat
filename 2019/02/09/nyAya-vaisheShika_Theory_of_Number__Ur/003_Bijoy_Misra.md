I have felt that the number theory is a very important concept that possibly came through by

the Jaina scholars or through Jaina tradition. In order to consider an object into a number,

one has to remove all the associated qualities in the object. So the concept of number

assumes the creation of a set of like-objects, such that they can have equal value to belong

in the set. I can say "five apples". where I ignore the size of the apples, but to say I have "five

fruits" would create a higher order of abstraction. Possibly length units (AnguLa) or time

units (paxma) would be considered the original concepts in numbers.  

I don't know if nyAya goes into analyzing what a number is. So, we have to ask what is  

meant by "2"? Addition becomes a still higher order abstraction.

  

In a lighter vein, in the modern days, all human beings are reduced to numbers! the concept of

generalization needs analysis.
