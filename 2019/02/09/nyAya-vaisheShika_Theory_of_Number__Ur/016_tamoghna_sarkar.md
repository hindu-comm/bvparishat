'Mathematical knowledge, as distinct from empirical knowledge of the

number of things, is considered by western philosophers of mathematics

to have a distinctive epistemological status. It is thought to be possible

to know a priori, without recourse to any empirical enquiry, that for ex-

ample 17 × 27 = 459. Interestingly, the Nyaya-Vai ¯ ses ´ .ika did consider the

hypothesis that mathematical truths are known by a special means, in the

course of their discussion of the source of knowledge called ‘inclusion’

(sam. bhava). Inclusion is said to have been recognised as an independent

source of knowledge by the Pauran¯ .ikas. Vatsy ¯ ayana defines it as ‘the cog- ¯

nition of the existence of one thing from the cognition of the existence

of another thing never absent from the first’ (1985: 574). He cites, as an

example, coming to know of an ad¯. haka from a dron. a. Ad¯. haka and dron. a

are both measures of grain, the former being one quarter of the latter. So

the point is that one is in a position to know that one has a quantity x

of grain if one knows that one has a quantity of grain that includes x.

Later writers give an example more relevant to our present purposes: the

inference that there are a hundred of a certain thing because there are a

thousand. We must take ‘there are a hundred’ to mean ‘there are at least

a hundred’ and not ‘there are exactly a hundred’. However, although they

mention ‘inclusion,’ the Nyaya authors fail to recognise in it any distinctive ¯

epistemological features. They reduce it to the standard pattern of quasi-

inductive inference, in which one infers that something is F because it is

G, on the basis of one’s knowledge that F never occurs without G. Know-

ledge of the invariable concomitance between F and G is, however, taken

to be derived from a search for counter-examples, cases where F is present

without G. As long as one can find no such counter-example, one has a

good reason to believe that the properties are concomitant. The inference

that there are a hundred because there are a thousand, on the other hand,

is based on the inclusion of a hundred in a thousand, something which one

can come to know without searching for counter-examples or performing

any empirical enquiry. This example shows how the scientific empiricism

of the Nyaya-Vai ¯ ses ´ .ika authors deterred them, rightly or wrongly, from

accepting the existence of a priori mathematical truth' (Ganeri, 2001)
