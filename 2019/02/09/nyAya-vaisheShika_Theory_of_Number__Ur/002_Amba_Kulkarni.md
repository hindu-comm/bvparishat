2+2=4, is a mathematical truth. Thus this is a 'pramaa'.

Since this is a pramaa, natural question is what is the [pramaa.na](http://pramaa.na), i.e. '[pramaa-kara.na](http://pramaa-kara.na)' for this pramaa.

You are assuming that it is 'anumaana', and with this assumption, now you would like to know what are the pa\~nca-avayavas.

  

I do not know the answer. Neither have I thought over it. I'm just trying to help you in proceeding further by suggesting a few steps.  

  

In order to understand this pramaa through pa\~nca-avayavii, first you will have to define what is meant by '+' and what is meant by '='.

  

Then the next question arises, what is the [pak.sa](http://pak.sa), what is saadhya, what is the hetu, what is the vyaapti, and so on.

Once you have answers to all these, you can formulate it as a pa\~nca-avayavii.

  

Best,  

Amba Kulkarni
