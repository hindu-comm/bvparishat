It is pertinent to quote Prof. J.L. Shaw who in his book 'Indian Analytic and Anglophone Philosopy' opines -

  

*//It is to be noted that the Nyaya theory of number cannot be equated with logicism (realism or Platonism), intutionism (conceptualism), or formalism (nominalism). It cannot be identified with logicism as numbers greater than one are not discovered by us or independent of us, or reducible to sets.  
  
Again these number are not mental concepts or constructed entities, but qualities of objects and properties of sets. Hence this view cannot be equated with intutionism. Moreover, it cannot be equated with formalism as numbers are real qualities of substances of properties of sets of entities*.//
