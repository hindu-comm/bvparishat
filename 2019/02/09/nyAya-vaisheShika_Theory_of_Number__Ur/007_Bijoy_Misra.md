But then an "object" has to be defined!

Is it what separates the other in space, shape, appearance, color? Is object a mental-construct?  

I have not studied, but I believe there must be huge analysis to

initiate counting as a process.

I do not know if the concept of "digit" predates the concept of "object".

Please write if known.

Thank you.
