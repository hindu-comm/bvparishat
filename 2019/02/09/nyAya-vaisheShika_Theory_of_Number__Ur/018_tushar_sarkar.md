About Jrs's view that according to  
NV 'digit' is a 'quality' (a 'guna'). Not really, rather 'samkhya' is. A digit is an indicator of a 'samkhya' which differs from system to system e.g., 12 & XII but the number in a 'dozen' remains the same. Paying attention to such subtleties may help avoiding useless cross-talks.
