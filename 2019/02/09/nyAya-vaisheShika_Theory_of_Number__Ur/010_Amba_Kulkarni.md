Misra ji,

  

As far as my knowledge of Navya-Nyaaya goes, I do not think they address the issues that you are seeking for

  

The emphasis of Navya Naiyaayikas was on pramaa.nas. So they were more interested in the validity of the cognition that 'these are two objects'.

And in this journey, they brought in a new concept - paryaapti sambandha. Then they posited that dvitva (two-ness) resides in two objects simultaneously by paryaapti sambandha

inhering in each of the objects separately.  

  

Jonardan Ganeri in his article 'Numbers as properties of Objects: Frege and Nyaaya' remarks that

  

"I would like to observe a point of similarity between the Nyaya theory and Russell's definition of the number n as the class of all classes of n objects."

  

From this remark, I understand that there is an attempt to provide the '[lak.sa.na](http://lak.sa.na)' or definition of the numbers in the abstract sense.

For the naiyaayikas, a number is a property associated with an object or group of objects. And they have come up with the definition, through abstraction, which goes very close to the way Russell defined the numbers.  

  

Jains, as you have rightly stated, have dealt with numbers. In fact in Jain mathematics, I am told, one comes across infinities of infinity. But I do not have any first hand exposure to any of these texts, and hence I can not elaborate it more.

  

Best,

Amba
