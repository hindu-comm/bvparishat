नमो विद्वद्भ्यः,

  

Would like to record that I am keenly following this thread (am a professional mathematician) and am finding it very useful. This is important because, I would think the application of \`logic' to Mathematics, then through it to Physics, then onto Technology, is what makes \`logic' become part of curriculum in schools / colleges; also, this is what has given the western \`Science' the preeminent position it enjoys today. The success of Indian mathematicians - Aryabhata, Brahmagupta, Bhaskaracharya, Varahamihira, Madhava, Nilakantha, .... - in developing tools and solving many difficult problems, is being widely recognised and acknowledgednow; they must have used nyaya effectively to arrive at their results. The present discussion is very valuable in this sense. Kindly allow me to be a bit ambitious and propose that we continue this so as to culminate in a 2-3 days discussion meeting, whcih might eventually lead to it being recommended for inclusion in curriculum.

  

धन्यो’स्मि . . . . yoga
