In the western philosophy and mathematics, there is no concept of "object".

The earth is pre-defined and senses exist. The question would be how

do we create a distinction. The mental construct would be the key.

  

One may think of sensory and extra-sensory universes. In the latter,

the universe is analog, a space, hence the word shUnya (void).

In the sensory world we have "objects". But then each sense has

its independent perception. A  '[lak.sa.na](http://lak.sa.na) can develop through  

integrating various modalities and "creating" an object in the mind.  

  

Somebody might have analyzed. So I mentioned Jaina.
