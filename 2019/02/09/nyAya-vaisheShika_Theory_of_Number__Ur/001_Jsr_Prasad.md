Since it is a सङ्ख्या, it should come under गुण category

Number 4 is cognized through pratyaksha pramana, through apeksha-buddhi. This applies to all - ekatva, dvittva, trittva and so on. Whereas, the five member syllogism is based on anumana pramana, that too, paraartha-anumana. So, why do we employ anumanam when it is a direct perception.  

  

Hope, this helps.

  

Regards
