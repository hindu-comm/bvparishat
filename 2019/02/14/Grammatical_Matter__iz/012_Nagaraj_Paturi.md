I don't know how this wrong usage entered English grammatical vocabulary for Sanskrit forms, but I found that Prof. Deshpande is right in saying that in Engish notes on Sanskrit forms.

  

But you might notice that the Latin grammar page that I provided link for too does not have examples of past non-finite for gerund.
