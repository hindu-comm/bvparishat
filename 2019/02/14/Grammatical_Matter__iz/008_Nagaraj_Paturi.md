Your holiness,

  

Kritvaa, Gatvaa etc. are not called gerunds in English grammatical parlance.

  

They are called past non-finite forms.

  

Having done, Having gone etc. are English equivalents.

  

'Walking' in Walking is good for health is an example for gerund.

  

Chalanam is the Sanskrit equivalent.
