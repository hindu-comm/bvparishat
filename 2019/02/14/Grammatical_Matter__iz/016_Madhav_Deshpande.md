Dear Sivasenani Ji,

  

  The usage of terms like gerund and gerundive goes back to their use in classical Latin grammars, and it was subsequently adapted to describe the grammar of Sanskrit about two hundred years ago. Here is a book on the history of these terms:

  I agree with you that these terms are not self-explanatory to modern English speakers. However, this is the case with most technical terminologies in English that are derived from Latin, and the Sanskrit terms themselves are not self-explanatory and need definitions. Using Sanskrit terms certainly helps Indian readers, but the Sanskrit terms are not comprehensible to readers outside India. At the end of the day, authors write for specific audiences and make choices of what terminology is long established in a specific field and will be comprehensible to that audience. While teaching Sanskrit at Michigan to American students, I realized that even terms like "adverb" and "adjective" did not mean anything to some of them and needed explanations, and words like "indeclinable" and "affixes" or "prefixes" were incomprehensible for quite some time. At least, they were familiar with some grammatical terminology that they had encountered while studying English grammar in their schools. I had to make some effort to find out what the students were familiar with. My own daughters' school textbooks were useful to me in this respect.
