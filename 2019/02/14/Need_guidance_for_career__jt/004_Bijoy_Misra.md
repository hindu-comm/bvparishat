Dear Namrata,

Do develop strong analytic skills. Analysis is a process when

we examine a topic from its elements. Sanskrit research is lately  

done by comparing books or views from the old scholars. Time

has come where it can be a science by itself. India is known

for her original views in dissecting minutia. Please help lead the  

new generation in discovering the nuances in mind, thought,

language, tone, accent, grammar, numbers, life and living.

It may be hard, It would be a unique enriching experience.  

Keep the mind open and think originally from the ground up!

Hope you would consider. It may need discipline and strong

determination. Develop it.

Best wishes,

Bijoy Misra
