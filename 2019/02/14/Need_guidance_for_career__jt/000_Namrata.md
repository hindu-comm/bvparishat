Namonamaha. I have studied Shastri, Acharya and currently pursuing Vidyavaridhi (Ph.D) in Sanskrit Sahitya,

and have good grades in studies since and have been an enthu in studying new things but I am confused about What Next in my life?

Which is the field that I can contribute to society at my best?

Till now, I know 1 option only- to become an Assistant.Prof then Associate Prof, then later in my life Professor

Are there any other alternatives too? Please guide me, respected scholars. Pranam-sahitaha dhanyavaadaha.
