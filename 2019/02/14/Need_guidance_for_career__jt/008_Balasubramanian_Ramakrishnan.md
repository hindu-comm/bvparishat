Dear Namrata-ji,

  

A late reply, but here's a link you may find interesting:<https://mellon.org/resources/shared-experiences-blog/why-study-philosophy/>

  

Bill MIller is a legendary investor in the UnitedStates.

  

In the United States, a large number of students in areas like ReligiousStudies, South Asian Studies, Sanskrit, etc., end up in quite a varied areas such as think tanks, policy wonks in the state department and such, even the film industry, entertainment industry and so on. What they take to their jobs is their liberal arts training which helps analyze various situations as explained by Bill MIller. Another thing they also take with them to their jobs is a racist hatred of Indians and especially Hinduism inculcated in them by their professors. We can see examples everyday here in the US. I think we just don't have the scale of Sanskrit studying people in India going into influential places like in the US. A traditional training in Sanskrit, and especially subjects like pUrva-mImAmsA, going to the "influencer" positions is a must and I think it is bound to happen as India gets more prosperous.Just a thought.
