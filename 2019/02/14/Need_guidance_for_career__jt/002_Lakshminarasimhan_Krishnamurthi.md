Hi Namrata,

You can be an excellent news anchor if your pronunciation is good;a news editor if you are strong in language skills. Publishing Houses always need people with good language skills.

You can be a good lawyer with your Sanskrit background.

You can pursue careen or become an entrepreneur in NLP or AI if you have taste for linguistics & proficient in simple programming.

You can become a good HR manager or Admin Manager.

You can try for CA/IAS if you have perseverance. 

I suggest that you try for any field other than teaching profession as you will have Zero competition from Sanskrit people in these areas. :)

Also, as a last option, there are many NGOs who are working on new areas. What stops you in trying new fields as per your taste & expertise.

Regards
