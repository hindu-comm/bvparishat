Namaste

  

It depends on the relationship with passed away relative. If Father or Mother has passed away 1 year must expire and then only Mantropadesha can be done. But some people are performing Shubha Karyas like marriages after sixmonths also. If other relatives like grandfather or uncle has passed away more relaxation of rule is allowed. Reliable Purohit can guide you.
