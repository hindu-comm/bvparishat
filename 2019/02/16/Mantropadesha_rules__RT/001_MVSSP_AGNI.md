No . Its called as " samvatsara sutaka " in this even the persons donot celebrate festivals. So i feel its not possible. Coming to the book there is a book called as MANTRA DEEKSHA by the RAMA KRISHNA MUTT. And normally the books like DEEKSHA MANDARA is the book which deals with that. And other books such as sarada tilaka tantra and the prapancha sara tantra deals with the mantra sastra.
