Pardon my ignorance and the delay in replying.

  

Could someone please translate in English so I can understand?

  

Looks like there is a difference of opinion on what the rules are and whether the aashoucha applies only to vaidika karma or not.

  

I'm unclear if a final verdict has been reached.

  

Thank you all again,

Ramachandran Gurumoorthy.
