Namaste

  

1. On \< It depends on the relationship with passed away relative.>

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**BVK Sastry**: ' Who assessesthe ' depends' factor which makes ' Karma' a ' anu-shaasana' for the context? and take it beyond ' conveniences' ?? Is it a 'Guru' market or a ' Customer market'? The ' aashaucha rules' have more exceptions sitting in the rule book than one can imagine. Staring from the simplest of ' separated by a distance factor , by river, mountain to the most complex issues of ' punah samskara'. More over, the extension of ' aashaucha' rules, mantra deekshaa conditions vary by Varna-Ashrama - Kaala/ Niyama dharma
factors. Where are we taking these in to account ??

  

------------------

  

2. If Father or Mother has passed away 1 year must expire and then only Mantropadesha can be done. But some people are performing Shubha Karyas like marriages after sixmonths also. If other relatives like grandfather or uncle has passed away more relaxation of rule is allowed. Reliable Purohit can guide you.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**BVK Sastry**: The \< parental relation factor> is not so simple ! in the current period , and in the extended global society. second marriage, divorces, and other social factors play a role; and many times these are ' undisclosed'.

We need to look clearly at the ' socio-cultural conveniences that have evolved in the communities' in the specific window and the guiding principle, leading to the question: ' Why and How , how long Aashuacha' makes one ineligible for ' Mantra deekshaa / abyaasa'. It is here that Yoga tradition comes in; and we don't seem to have ' PUROHITAS ' with ' Yoga -Shaastra ' expertise. Almost every one is happy to quote gita as Vedanta shaastra and keep aside the ' Yoga directives'.

  

This issue is deliberated in Sayana bhashaya in the preamble explaining why ' Karma Kanda related Veda understanding for Purohita' is more important than the 'Vedanta understanding of Vedas'.

  

------------------

  

**Closing Thought**: ' Do we have still surviving ' RELIABLE PUROHITAS' who can guide the seeker with CONTEXT SPECIFICITY ? Where are the Training- audit - Certifying institutions who can show the skin below the wraps of cultural clothe attire ??

  

The pedagogic system of TRAINING THE PUROHIT at GURUKULS / MATHAS
for 21 st century needs to be revisited and the frame work of VALUE- AUDIT needs to go back and fit in to the guidelinefrom VEDAS : -' वयं
राष्ट्रे जागृयाम पुरोहिताः- अग्निं ईळे पुरोहितं' . Unfortunate, it is a standing situation that there has been a collapse of this ' VAIDIKA
PUROHITA ' training system that can meet theglobal dynamics of
current society. What we seem to be discussing are It is not necessary to make a defense of what is surviving, go ga ga over how it was done in the past, what the rule books say and how much we have deviated ( taking excuses from Smruti shastra conveniences and ' apta- acharya vakya pramanas' to mess up with Karma-Kanda, using the
instructions provided for JNANA KANDA practitioners.

  

There seems to be a need to be a revisit and in house stock taking on several of these issues.
