नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

I'm unclear if a final verdict has been reached.

  

                      ------Vid Ramachandran Gurumoorthy.  

  

Yes , there is a difference of opinion -- 10 or 12 days अशौच for all - everything like प्राणायाम is मानसिक but not वाचिक ( one should do मनन in the mind rather than utter the मन्त्रs loudly) .

  

Some people , such as in Telugu states , holding अशौच ( popularly called सूतकम् ) for one year and during that time they do not go to temple, do not perform any पर्वदिनम् and so on - because after death the कर्ता has to perform 16 मासिकs - this अशौच is secondary - during 10/12 days outsiders should not touch them - this is not so - after 10/12 days one may touch them .

As far as मन्त्रोपदेश is concerned it cannot be done during 10/12 days . After that till the end of the year it depends on प्रान्तीयाचार - this is called शिष्टाचार , i e it is not stated in स्मृति (धर्मशास्त्रम् ) but शिष्टs have been following as an अविच्छिन्नाचार । ’ आचारश्चैव साधूनाम् ’ - this वाक्यम् from मनुस्मृति is प्रमाणम् in following शिष्टाचार ।

  

During the सूतकम् , daughter's ( dead person's) marriage can be performed , so that the कन्यादानफलम् would reach the dead person - while son's ( dead person's ) marriage should not be performed -- धर्मस्य तत्त्वं निहितं गुहायाम् ।
