Sir  
The opinions given here by the scholars are based on smruthies.I guess, by mantra upadesa, you mean a mantra from Tantric texts. In that case , these rules cannot be the deciding factor. The onus is completely on the guru. Tantric texts say one need not worry about anything if the guru has decided to give the mantras.Let me add a word of caution.The guru should be a real guru and not someone who looks for fast cash.
