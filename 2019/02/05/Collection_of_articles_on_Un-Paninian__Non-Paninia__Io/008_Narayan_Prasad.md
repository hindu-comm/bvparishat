Dear Sir,

  Actually 5 articles in this series were published by E.D. Kulkarni. But I have scanned so far only first page of each one in the series.

  The 6th in the series is "Unpaninian uages in Mahabharata" by V.D. Gokhale. This deals with compounds.

  

  Details of these publications have been given by Cardona in "Panini: A Survey of Research" (1976).

  

  I have collected most of them and in addition some others as well.

  

  Apāṇinīyapramāṇatā of Narayana Bhatta was published long back by Pt Yudhisthir Mimansak in his book "संस्कृत व्याकरणशास्त्र का इतिहास", भाग-3.

  

  In book form, "[A Grammar of Epic Sanskrit](https://archive.org/details/AGrammarOfEpicSanskritThomasOberlies/page/n1)" (2003) by Thomas Oberlies could be a good reference work.

  

  Thanks and regards

  Narayan Prasad
