Namaste.  

  

About 25 years back or so, I collected a lot many articles on "Un-Paninian/ Non-Paninian usages in Sanskrit literature". For example, one with the title "Solecism in Sanskrit Literature: A Linguistic Study" is attached herewith. The author of this article quotes an interesting किंवदन्ती related to this topic:

अपशब्दशतं माघे भारवेस्तु शतत्रयम् ।

कालिदासे न गण्यन्ते कविरेको धनञ्जयः ॥

  

BTW, I have not read or seen any work of धनञ्जय कवि.

  

I do not have access to p.121 of the article "Un-Paninian usages in Mahabharata" (pp.121-128) by V.D. Gokhale. Cf. p.56 of George Cardona (1976). Panini: A Survey of Research.

  

I was thinking of disposing off the photocopies of these articles. But then I thought, some people may find them useful. So I planned to prepare a scanned copy of all the articles before disposing them off.

  

If anybody is interested in these articles, I can scan them in my leisure time.

  

Regards

Narayan Prasad
