Dear Prasad Ji,

  

  Thanks for the Bandyopadhyaya article. I am attaching an article by E. D. Kulkarni of the Deccan College on unPāṇinian forms in the Mahābhārata. A wider search would yield many more publications of this kind. Studies of similar unPāṇinian forms in the Rāmāyaṇa and the Bhāgavata Purāṇa come to my mind. Damsteegt's "[Epigraphical Hybrid Sanskrit: Its Rise, Spread, Characteristics and Relationship to Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit (Asian Studies)](https://www.amazon.com/Epigraphical-Hybrid-Sanskrit-Characteristics-Relationship/dp/9004057250/ref=sr_1_6?keywords=Damsteegt&qid=1549808199&s=books&sr=1-6)" and Van Daalen's book Vālmīki's Sanskrit \[and its reviews by Richard Solomon and others\] are also useful in the study of unPāṇinian usages of Sanskrit. Some of the recent work by Jan Houben on Nārāyaṇabhaṭṭa's approach to Sanskrit and his work Apāṇinīyapramāṇatā is useful as well.
