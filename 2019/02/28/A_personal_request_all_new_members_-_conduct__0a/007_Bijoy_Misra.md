Friends,

  

India has been a home of free thinking and BVP should cherish it.

I wrote the note for people to reflect how we operate a group like

BVP in the modern era of casual social communications.  

Prof Paturi and others are doing their best. We as a group can help

as peers. Group moderation is easier than individual moderation.

  

Lately i have been strongly impressed with the literature advocating

precision in thinking. I am looking for evolution of literature in conceptual

thinking. Particularly the concept of digitization through grouping appears

fascinating to me. It has to do with the analog to digital conversion.

Panini seems to know about it, but how did it come to be?  

  

Class identification and specificity have been analyzed by Patanjali

and Bhartrhari, but not the analytic need for the class as a tool. I  

would like to know if we have a scholar who has studied the Jaina Agama  

literature. Please write me offline.  

  

Best regards,

BM
