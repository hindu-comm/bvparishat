Dear new members,

  

I am writing this note after observing various casual and careless postings that  

are being done in the pretext of being a "novice". "conduct" is universal. India  

taught to the world that a person is known by his/her conduct. Chanakya codified  

it as a foundation of a civil society. India's position in the world is defined by the  

personal discipline of conduct that Indian population has exhibited
over the centuries.

  

"Conduct" has two aspects, one internal and the other external.
Speaking the truth,  

expressing in measured words,caring for coherence and precision are internal. These  

come through long period of studies and practice.The external conduct is manifested  

in presenting oneself in a group with dignity and personality. The latter is the core of  

India's culture that "we exist and we belong".

  

It is a tricky question to think when do we sacrifice our freedom to belong in a group.  

This goers back to the very early analysis on forming a society. The basic norm of

studentship stems from developing a respectful attitude to the tradition and knowledge.

While it can be stated that we can only be on our own by discarding the norm, we do

observe that any new thought necessarily involves calmness and utter discipline.

  

Through this note, I would request all new members to introduce themselves by stating

their full name and the area of interest. We have to reduce casualness and be conscious

of the task we have on hand. Together we can build the intellectual recovery of modern  

India. We have to maintain the educational aspect of the BVP group.
Hope all would

cooperate.

  

Best regards,
