Sir, I think, such people should not be inducted into the group.

I also manage a group. Initially I kept the option that anybody could join the group. But after a few days such a fellow joined who started posting links related to pornography. I had to take immediate action and thereafter without getting a brief Intro, I never allot membership to anybody.

Regards

Narayan Prasad
