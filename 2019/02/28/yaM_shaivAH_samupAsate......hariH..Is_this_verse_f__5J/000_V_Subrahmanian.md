In the Hanumannatakam, the third verse is:

This work is said to be authored by Hanuman himself and Bhoja Raja (early 11th century CE) got this compiled/edited by Damodara Misra of his court. Could we imagine that Bauddha, and Jaina doctrines were known in the time of the Ramayana? Or, taking the view that Hanuman is chiranjeevi, he was aware of these doctrines when they were propounded.
Or again, going by the dictum 'all doctrines have existed always', there is no surprise in these doctrines / their proponents named in the above verse. Which of these views would scholars take in this case?

  

Thanks and warm regards
