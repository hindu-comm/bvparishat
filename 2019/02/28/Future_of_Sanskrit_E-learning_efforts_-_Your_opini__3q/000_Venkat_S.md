Dear Sir/ Madam,

Namaste.

Many organisations and individuals across the world are working for spreading the Samskritam Language. Lot of digital/ e-learning efforts have emerged in the last 5 years. In order to assess the quality of learning of these e-learning systems, we have a small survey that would take approximately 8-10 minutes to complete.



Your responses to this survey shall help my doctoral research ( Dr. Shrinivasa Varakhedi is my guide) and improve the e-learning systems prevailing in the market.



Thank you very much for your time.

Note: In case you are uncomfortable taking the survey for any reason and this email has landed in the wrong inbox; I apologize for the same. You can ignore the same.
