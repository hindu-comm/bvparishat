नमस्काराः ।

  

I own a copy of Dhvanyaloka of Anandavardhana edited by K.Krishnamoorthy published by Motilal Banarasidas (re-print 2016) but due to my hindsight while purchasing some of the pages have been missed out in the book print.

  

Since i am unable to find an online version on Archive and elsewhere, I place my request before the group members.

  

Could anyone owning the book kindly scan/snap the following pages and send them across?

  

Pages viii - xxiv (The portion after the foreword by K.R.Srinivasa Iyengar)

  

  

Thanks and Regards,

Pooja
