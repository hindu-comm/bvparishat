May I crave your kind attention on amiscellaneous but not so minor issue?

The success of a Conference depends on the management team and the participants.

  

BVP-Udupi Conference witnessed participants from all over India and abroad.

They too deserve an appreciation in making the conference a grand success.  

The list of registered participants may be appended to the document or on any formal documentary record of the BVP-Udupi Conference.

It will boost their enthusiasm to participate in future BVP events.  

Best Wishes

Sati Shankar
