Pranaam,

  

I wish to study the original and Unedited versions of our ancient texts like Vedas, Upanishads, Vedanta, Shashtra, Mahabharat, Ramayan etc.

  

Can anyone please point me towards the source of such texts. Either online websites, repositories or any offline publications.

  

When I search on the internet I find many translations in English. And many of them written by English(foreign) authors. I'm also aware about many edits made by britishers in our ancient texts and am unsure which one is authentic and which are edited versions.

  

I seek help.

  

Please guide me.

  

Thank you.

Rahul Gupta.
