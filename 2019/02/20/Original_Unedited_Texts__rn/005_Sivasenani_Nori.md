Rahul ji, Shraddha ji

  

For each of the texts mentioned by you, a slightly different approach is needed.

  

In the case of Mahabharata, BORI has prepared a critical edition, taking great pains over a period of three decades. In the academic world this is the edition most referred to, but many especially outside academia do not consider this as the standard edition, mainly because the editors have well, 'edited' the text but based on manuscript evidence. This has been discussed here in BVP itself to some extent. However, the critical edition is a treasure of variant readings. There is so much material that this itself is a separate branch of study.

  

There is also a critical edition of Ramayana (Baroda edition), with respect to which most of the discussion about the Mahabharata critical edition applies.

  

When it comes to Vedas (includes Upanishads and Vedanta), the tradition followed by one's family is to be consulted by practitioners. For non-practitioners, and for practitioners without ready access to traditional sources, Max Muller's second edition may be consulted. It is available online and may be kindly searched. It may be noted that it is usually held that whatever one's Guru says is the correct reading, and not the printed version.

  

In Shastra, we have fairly reliable mulagranthas. Usually these are studied with commentaries. Once you begin the study of any Shastra, you will be able to navigate to authentic versions fairly easily. If you learn from a teacher, the teacher would guide you; in case of self-study, the prefatory material is usually rich enough for you to arrive at a dependable edition.

  

If I be allowed a remark on this subject, corruption of source texts is not a problem we face presently; proper study and understanding of the available texts is the problem we have presently.

Senani
