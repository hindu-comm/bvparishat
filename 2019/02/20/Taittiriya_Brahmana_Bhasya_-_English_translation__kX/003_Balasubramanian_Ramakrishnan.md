Dear Sri Sastry,

  

There is no complete translation of the taittirIya-brAhmaNa. However Paul-Emile Dumont translated the entire 3rd aShTakam, the kAThakam, and prashna-s 1, 6, and 8 of the 2nd aShTakam. He published them in the Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society many decades ago. I can't send pdfs to you due to copyright reasons. However you can easily access them through [jstor.org](http://jstor.org) if your institution has an arrangement with them. Otherwise you can set up an account and borrow up to 5 articles or so at a time for free.

  

Ramakrishnan
