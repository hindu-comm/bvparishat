Namaste,

  

A number of years ago I carefully photocopied all of these installments, 1948-1969, and later scanned my photocopies and posted them on the web here: <http://www.downloads.prajnaquest.fr/BookofDzyan/Sanskrit%20Hindu%20Texts/taittiriya_brahmana_incomplete_1948-1969_eng.pdf>.  

I see that someone has kindly taken my file and posted it on Archive.org, making it much more widely accessible. You can download it from either place.  

There is no English translation of any of either of the two bhasyas that I know of.  

  

Best regards,

  

David Reigle
