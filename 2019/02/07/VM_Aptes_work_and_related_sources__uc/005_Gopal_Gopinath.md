Namaste, Sri Madhavji, Sri Anilkumarji,

  

my sincere thanks to you both for the information. Will definitely follow up with that. I am trying to re-read Sri Apte's 2-part paper and it is refreshing every time to see his approach and how masterly he separates his explanation of the gnosis of rig mantras used in smartha prayogas from the prayogas and their immediate purport.  

  

sincerely

..gopal gopinath
