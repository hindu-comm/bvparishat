Dear Dr. Aklujkar,

  

Thanks for the pointers. I will follow up on the Vedic Bibliography by RND. I may have access to them. Recently I came across Dr. Thite's two volumes on Apastamba sutras and I will contact him. I do not find his email ID on the site and hopefully an email to the secretary or to a generic id given there should suffice.  

  

Sincerely,

..gopal gopinath
