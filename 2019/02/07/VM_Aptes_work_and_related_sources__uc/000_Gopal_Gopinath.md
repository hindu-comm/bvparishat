Namaste,

  

Going over Sri VM Apte's work published in the Bulletin of Deccan College Research Institute "The RgVeda mantras in their ritual setting in the grhya sutras", I found his statements in the final pages interesting. For one, he mentions about a collection of Rg mantras in 15 grhya sutras that he had compiled by then. Secondly, he writes about his intention to do a similar mapping on Asvalaya srauta sutras to begin with.  

  

I am looking to find materials in these two contexts by him, or others. I tried to find in the JSTOR collection but a bit more refined search would help. Could the scholars in this list help me where to look for such materials? Are the notes from Sri Apte still preserved or published? Anybody else in his academic lineage took up the questions for further exploration? The first part of the two part article was published, incidentally, in 1939...

  

thanks for any help,

..gopal gopinath
