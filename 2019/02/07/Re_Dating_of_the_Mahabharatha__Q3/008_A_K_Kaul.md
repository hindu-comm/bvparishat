Respected Dr. B. V. K. Sastry,  

Jai Shri Ram!

Many thanks for the mail.

\<And resolving this issue depends on understanding the term ' yuga'!

What does this Samskruth Language Term mean! 

What did the term mean when it was used thousands of years ago ?\>

The sense in which the term yuga is used often is a conglomeration of four yugas (Chaturyuga or Mahayuga) viz. the Satya/Krita, Treta, Dwapara and Kaliyuga. It has been used in that sense ever since the Surya Siddhanta, in its present "Avatar", came into existence. In 1/13-17 it has explained in quite an unambiguous manner the duration/definition and composition of a "yuga"

मासैर्द्वादशभिर्वर्षं दिव्यं तदह उच्यते \|13\|

सुरासुरानामन्योन्यमहोरात्रम् विपर्ययात् \| तत्षष्टिः षड्गुणा दिव्यं
वर्षमासुरामेवच \|\|14\|\|

तद्द्वादश सहस्राणि चतुर्युगमुदाह्रतम् \| सुर्याब्दसंख्यया द्वित्रि सागरैरयुताहृतैः \|15\|

सन्द्यासंद्यांश सहितम्विज्ञेयम् तच्चतुर्युगं \| कृतादीनां व्यवस्थेयं धर्मपादव्यवस्थया \|\|16\|\|

युगस्य दशमो भागश्चतुस्त्रिद्व्येक संगुणः \| क्रमात् कृतयुगादीनां षष्ठांशः संद्ययो स्वकः \|\|17\|\|

"Solar month is the time which the sun requires to travel from one sign of the zodiac to the next. A solar year consists of twelve solar months and this is called a day of the gods. An *ahoratra* (day and night) of the gods and that of the demons are mutually the reverse of each other (viz a day of the gods is a night of the demons and a night of the gods is a day of the demons). Sixty such*ahoratras* multiplied by six is a year of the gods and demons.

The time containing twelve thousand years of gods is called a Chaturyuga i.e. the aggregate of the four yugas viz. Krita, Treta, Dwapara and Kaliyuga. These four yugas including their *sandhyas* and *sandhyamshas* contain 4,320,000 solar years. The number of years included in these small yugas are proportional to the number of the legs of dharma (Virtue) personified".

Almost all the Purana and siddhantas are of a similar view regarding the Yuga dauration etc.

\<What approach is to be taken to fix the Samskruth term meaning? And in this ' yuga' case, Do we go by context of planetary position, as on date of war ? Or narratives that occured on the battle field, as per
description of the term in Bhagavad-gita, said to be discourse on the battle field just before the commencement of war ?>

Scholars have been breaking their heads for the last more than a century in deciphering the "planetary position, as on date of war" as given in the epic and they have arrived at dates ranging from 6228 BC (V. R. Lele) through October 16, 5561 BCE (Dr. P V Vartak and Nilesh Neelakantha Oak) to 900 BCE (H. C. Raychaudhury) thus covering a span of more than 5000 years! It looks that the "planetary details" of the "Mahabharata" are so fascinating and enchanting that the Mahabharata war must have continued at least for 5000 years!

\<Should one go by the Gregorian model of years or one of the eighteen Jyotisha siddhantas spread over some 2000 years or more?>

Gregorian model is actually a reformed model of Julian calendar which was nothing but a seasonal calendar. I have studied all the major Puranas and siddhantas thoroughly and I find that they are also advocating nothing but a seasonal calendar--of course a luni-solar one as against the purely solar Gregorian model.

\<2a) Vedanga Jyotish (1400 BCE) indigenous approach is seen mixed with Dharma Shastra models of ' Four yugas', under which ' Kali yuga' comes in. Here goes the Aryabhatiya reference, leading to \< February 18, 3102 BCE as the start of Kaliyuga> . Conclusion simply is Nobody knows as to when the kaliyuga started ! \>

Vedanga Jyotisha is talking of nothing but a five year yuga comprising Samvatsara, Parivatsara, Idavatsara, Anuvasara and Idvatsara. It does not talk of any planets, much less their longitudes and positions, but gives simply the fundamental arguments for working out mean longitudes of the sun and the moon so that proper "muhurtas" like tithi, nakshra, ritu, masa, paksha etc. for yajnyas could be determined.

Even those mean longitudes of the sun and the moon of the VJ are far from being correct, but even then it is not less than a miracle that in those inclement and hostile circumstances in sub-zero temperatures surrounded by icicles hanging from trees and thatched roof-tops on the banks of "Mahapadma-sar" in Kashmir they could evolve such "system" as had at least a semblance of accuracy more than 3500 years back. It is really no mean achievement!

On the other hand, Aryabhata has taken the orbital elements from the old Surya Siddhanta of Pancha-Siddhantika and "manipulated" them in a manner to work out a "Chaturyuga" of his choice since according to him, every yuga has a duration of 4,320,000 divided by 4 = 1,080,000 years instead of the ratio 1:2:3:4!

Thus according to Aryabhata, the next cycle of Krita-yuga will not start after 432,000 years from February 18, 3102 BCE but after 1,080,000 years from that date!

A very very long wait for the next "golden age"--Satya-yuga--- indeed!


\<2b) Follow what Srimad Bhagavad gita (8-17), which is said to be dialogue-discourse on Mahabharata - Kurukshetra war-filed ; where we find the reference of Yuga time measure, specifically mentioning the ' Vedanga Jyotisha tradition as ' aho-raatra vido janah':

sahasra-yuga-paryantam, ahar yad brahmano viduh ; ratrim yuga-sahasrantam te 'ho-ratra-vido janah \|\|\>

Surprisingly, the Surya Siddhanta has just reverberated in 1/20 the same sentiment of the Bhagvad-Gita in the following words

इत्थं युग सहस्रेण भूतसंहारकारकः \| कल्पो ब्राह्ममहः प्रोक्तं शर्वरी तस्य तावती \|\|

"Thus a thousand of the great yugas make a KALPA, a period which destroys the whole world. It is a day of the God Brahma, and his night is equal to his day"\| Bapu Dev Sastri translation.

The SS has gone further and even proclaimed the total life span of Brahmaji, and his age as on date. In fact, it is the same "Samkalpa" as adumbrated in the SS that every Hindu is "reciting" while performing Sandhya or Tarpana etc.

\<Close on the heels of this, we have Yuga-Purana / Hari-Vamsha where in this 'time' cycles are explained more clearly in relation to Jyotisha !THE Y UGA-P URANA AND THE TREATISES OF GARGA : The Yuga-Purdna appears as a chapter within a work on jyotisa ("astrology" in its widest sense, or the study of natural phenomena), whose author is stated to be either Garga or Vrddha-Garga ("the elder Garga"). 

(<https://archive.org/stream/TheYugaPurana/The%20Yuga%20Purana_djvu.txt>;<http://vedicilluminations.com/downloads/Mahabharata/Harivamsa/hvapp0707.txt>)\>

Whether it is "Yuga Purana" or Markandeya Purana or Narada Purana or Shri Vishnu Purana and so on and so forth, all of them echo the SS dimensions of time span of yugasignoring Aryabhatiya dimensions as if they never existed! (attachment VP yugaduration)  

However, no Purana has give any starting date of any yuga, unlike Aryabhata who had claimed in 499 AD that he was 23 years old when 3600 years of Kaliyuga had elapsed! (Aryabhatiya 3/10)  

\<This model leads to different mind boggling time scale of several thousands of years ! (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_units_of_time>) (<https://www.bhagavad-gita.us/bhagavad-gita-8-17/>)\>  

Regarding the mind "boggling time scales of Puranas", the Surya Siddhanta itself takes the pride of place in that respect also!

It claims in the very second shloka of the very first chapter

अल्पावशिष्टे तु कृते मयो नाम महासुरः\| रहस्यं परमं पुण्यं जिज्ञासुर्ज्ञानमुत्तमम् \|2\|...

....मदंशः पुरुषोयं निःषेशस्ते कथयिष्यति \|9\|

"Sometime at the fag end of the Krita-Yuga, Maya the great Demon,being desirous of obtaining the sound, secret, excellent and sacred knowledge of Astronomy, which is the best of the six sciences subordinate to the Vedas, practiced the most difficult worship of the sun......(and finally,) the Sun God, through His ''amsha" revealed that knowledge to Maya"

As seen already, as per the duration of Yugas of the SS itself, the Kritya yuga ended 3101+2019 (years of Kaliyuga) plus 864,000 years of Dwapara Yuga plus 1,296,000 years of Treta Yuga i.e. 2,165,120 years
back! As such, the Surya Siddhanta that we have with us these days from which I am quoting these shlokas is a work supposed to have been revealed by none other than Surya Bhagwan to not some Brahmin or Rishi etc. but to a grreat Daitya--- a king of Demons--- about 22 lakhs of years back!

What is all the more surprising is that it has survived in its "pristine" form for such a long duration of time!

Till about a few decades back my grandfather, my father and even I myself in my childhood days believed every word of this ''Arsha work"!
But with the passage of time, I started feeling quite uneasy as to how I was being taken for a ride by the manipulation that the Surya Siddhanta that I am/was "reciting" is a work of 22 lakhs of years back!

What is all the more surprising and even ironic is that the orbital elements of this work known as Surya Siddhanta are a best fit for Shaka 444 i.e. 522 AD and that is why Munjala had advised in his Lagumanasa that one arc-minute was to be added every year to the mean longitudes of planets of the SS and such other works from that date! 

Then again, Bhagwan Ram is said to have Incarnated in the fag end of Treta Yuga. That means He was around 2,165,120 minus 1,296,000 years of Treta Yuga i.e. about 869,120 years back from the current year or about 867,000 BCE!

But even Nilesh Neelakanth Oak has not ventured beyond 12000 BCE about the date of the Valmiki Ramayana, which is said to have been a contemporaneous work of Bhagwan Ram! However, Dr. P V Vartak, another scholar, has calculated the horoscope of BhagwanRam for December 4, 7323 BCE whereas the late IRS officer Pushkar Bhatnagar had calculated His chart of January 10, 5114 BCE!

\<Are current Jyotisha software's providing a historic time cycle calculation and sky maps of early period constructed to be in tune with the texts of Vedanga jyotisha ??

There is a serious research required. This could change the way ' Indology (Swadeshi and Anya-deshi) is understood.

This is where that ' Yoga way of understanding Samskruth terms becomes critical'.

This 'Samskruth Language Modeling' is missing in the current
'Classical - oriental- conversational modes of Sanskrit learning'. While each approach is having its utility, they cannot over rule or substitute other model.\>

Yes, we must do a serious research and everybody including the galaxy of scholars who have worked out the dates of the Ramayana and the Mahabharata etc. etc. claim to be doing the same! They are all extraordinary scholars of Indian origin and of unassailable integrity.
None of them can be accused of any ulterior motive or having an axe to grind! But in spite of all such integrity and qualifications and scholarship and so an and so forth, if we are still groping in the dark, we must certainly do a lot of introspection as to why it is happening like that!

Could it be that we are carrying some "baggage" ---having some psychological constrictions/constraints that if we call a spade a spade maybe we will be misunderstood and considered as renegades or even heretics? I do not see otherwise any reason as to why on the one hand we claim that our siddhantas and other astronomical works of yore are masterpieces but at the same time resort to the data/algorithms and software of JPL/NASA? Why not calculate the horoscopes of Bhagwan Ram and Krishna etc. through the SS, which claims to be a work existing right from the fag end of Krita-Yuga-- at least about 1,200,000 years before the Incarnation of Bhagwan Ram? Is it because we know that the SS is a creation of early centuries of Christian Era and not of any Satya-Yuga and so on but cannot declare it openly like that! Otherwise I see no reason of have these double standards of paying just lip service to the Siddhantas but going by the ''*Anya-deshi*" software and algorithms?

To sum up, the Manusmriti has said

सत्यं ब्रूयात् प्रियं ब्रूयात्, न ब्रूयात सत्यं अप्रियं \| असत्यं च प्रियं न ब्रूयात् एतत् सत्यस्य लक्षणम् \|\|

"Must speak only such truth as is liked (by the listener). Must not speak such truths as are not to the liking of the listeners. Must not utter lies even if they are pleasing to the listener. That is the definition of truth"!

I know I have not been able to follow the Manu's dictum! But I have no regrets for the same.

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!

Avtar Krishen Kaul
