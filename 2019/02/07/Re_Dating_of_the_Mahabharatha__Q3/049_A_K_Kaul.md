Shivraj-ji,

Jai Shri Ram!

\<For your perusal here is a reference from Mahabharat about Zodiac:

Udyog Parv 5.47

 उच्चावचं थैवयुक्तं रहस्यं; थिव्याः परश्ना मृगचक्रा मुहूर्ताः  
 कषयं महान्तं कुरुसृञ्जयानां; निवेथयन्ते पाण्डवानां जयं च \[5.47.93\]

"Capable of explaining the mysteries of the Gods and of answering  
 questions regarding coming events, understanding the signs of  
 the zodiac, prophesying the great overthrow of the kuru and the  
 Srinjaya and the triumph of the Pandav." \[5.47.93\]\>  

Acharya Neelakantha has translated Mrigachakra as Sarvatobhadraadi Chakra in which it is decided as to which nakshatra is "pierced" by which planet!

Same is the case with the Gita Press translation which has said

Quote

...... वे शुभाशुभ पहलों का वर्णन करनेके लिए सर्वतोभद्रादि चक्रों का भी अनुसंधान करते हैं \| मुहूर्तशास्त्र के तो वे पंडित ही हैं \|

Unquote

Thus "mrigachakra" does not mean Rashis here!

As late as sixth century BCE, we did not have Mesha etc. Rashis in India, as will be evident from the Atharva Veda Parishishta attached herewith!

Btw, the AVP also talks about twenty-eight nakshatras, including Abhijit, just like the Atharva Veda itself! That itself means that they could never be linked to any equal nakshtra division of twenty-seven nakshatras, which were then supposed to be subsumed in the twelve Rashis, that too the so called nirayana!

\<And Gita is all about future prediction to Arjun by Krishn himself.>

No! Absolutely not!

Arjuna asks Bhagwan Krishna in 2/6 of the Gita

न चैतद्विद्मः कतरन्नो गरीयो \| यद्वा जयेम यदि वा नो जयेयुः \|....  

We do not know which is preferable for us---to fight or not to fight; nor do we know whether we shall win or whether they will conquer us.."  
Clearly, Arjuna does not appear to have consulted any soothsayer before jumping into the battlefield nor does he appear to have read, nay even heard about any Brihat Parshara Hora Shastram, as he would have consulted that work and checked his Dasha Bhuktis and gochara etc. before deciding to fight the "mother of all battles"

In response to such a loaded question, Bhagwan Krishna should have advised Arjuna to consult some jyotishi, or study "Brihat Parashari"but no what He advised Arjuna was entirely to the chagrin of today's astrologers!

हतो वा प्राप्स्यसि स्वर्गं जित्वा वा भोक्ष्यसे महीम् \| तस्मादुत्तिष्ठ कौन्तेय युद्धाय कृत निश्चयः \| (2/37)

''If you get killed in the battlefield you will win heaven; if you conquer the war, you enjoy sovereignty of the earth; therefore, stand up, Arjuna, determined to fight"

In fact, the Gita has advised us throughout that we should कुरु कर्मैव तस्मात् त्वं पूर्व पूर्वतरैः कृतं or क्लैभ्यं मा स्म गमः पार्थ नैतत् त्वयुपपद्य्ते instead of advising us to run to some jyhotishis before starting any venture!

\<RgVed mentions all 27 nakshatras. It knows 13 solar months including the intercalary month which gets dropped to keep calendars in sync.>

Yes, almost all the Vedas do talk of 27 nakshatras, whereas some Vedic mantras talk about 28 nakshatras!

Even when talking about twenty-seven nakshatras, it is quite clear that they cannot be of equal divisions, much less subsumed under twelve imaginary equal divisions of the ecliptic known as Rashis!

एकं द्वे त्रीणि चत्वारीनि वा अन्यानि नक्षत्राणि अथैता भूयिष्ठा य्त्कृत्तिकास् तद्भ्मानमेवैतदुपैति तस्मात् कृत्तिकास्वादधीत (शतपथ ब्राह्मन 2/1/2)

Krittikas alone consist of many stars, other asterisms (consisting of) one, two, three, or only four stars. (He who performs the agnyaadhaana ceremony on this nakshatra) gets plentifulness (or abundance) of this star. That is why fire should be lit on Krittikas" S B Dikshit translation.

Similarly, about thirteen months in the Vedas, as per the attachment Rigveda Hindi, a thirteenth (adhika-masa) is given rise to when there are more than one new Moon between two (so called) sayana Samktrantis!
This translation is by Vedic scholars Shivnath Ahitagni and Pandit Shankar Dutt Shastri, available with Rashtriya Samskrit Samsthan, New Delhi.

\<In my humble opinion if we approach a topic with a sense of enquiry we might learn more but if the idea is to show absence of this and that we might not learn that much.>

You are right and that is why I try to answer every mail so that if need be, I may change my "views" since I never considered myself as omniscient!

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!

Avtar
