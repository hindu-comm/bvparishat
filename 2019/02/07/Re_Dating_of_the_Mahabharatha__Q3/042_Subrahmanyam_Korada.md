नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

Dear Vid Kaul

  

Is there any internal evidence in Veda regarding the birth of Veda ?  

  

The above was my question - you claim to have seen Vedas from cover to cover , but did not answer the question - here is the answer --

  

.... अरे अस्य महतो भूतस्य निःश्वसितमेतद्यदृग्वेदो यजुर्वेदः सामवेदॊ’थर्वाङ्गिरसः इतिहासः पुराणं विद्या उपनिषदः....

                          -- बृहदारण्यकोपनिषत् , 4-5-11

  

1130 Branches of Veda are available only to those who have योगिप्रत्यक्षम् - like Panini , Katyayana , Patanjali

etc.-- refer to व्याकरणम् and पूर्वमीमांसा ।

Patanjali in महाभाष्यम् (पस्पशाह्निकम्) cautions people --

  

एतावन्तं शब्दस्य विषयम् अननुनिशम्य **अस्ति अप्रयुक्तः इति वचनं साहसमात्रमेव**

  

without looking into 1130 branches of Veda , all लोकs , वेदाङ्गानि , दर्शनानि etc if one says ' this शब्द is not used'

then he is too bold .

अननुनिशम्य = अनालोच्य

I fail to understand as to how one can make sweeping comments like - this is not there in Vedas .

  

Presently only 12/13 branches of Veda are available .

  

You also said names of Planets are not there in Vedangas -- what do you mean by this ? बृहज्जातकम्,

उत्तरकालामृतम् , मुहूर्तचिन्तामणि etc are considered as ज्योतिषग्रन्थs since time immemorial . Are they not प्रमाणम् ?

May be for you .

  

Do you have any knowledge of ग्रहशान्ति ?

  

There are मन्त्र s in कृष्णयजुर्वेद for all ग्रहs , अधिदेवतs and प्रत्यधिदेवतs . I will give just for one ग्रह - केतु ---

  

केतुं कृण्वन्नकेतवे पेशो मर्या अपेशसे । समुषद्भिरजायथाः ॥

  

Did you study पाणिनीयम् ? Did Panini anywhere say anything about - study of horoscopes ?

  

I do not study any Article/ Paper authored by anyone who has not
studied at least a couple of विद्यास्थानs

preferably in a गुरुकुलम् ।

  

By the by matters like date of Mahabharata war etc can be decided only thru योगिप्रत्यक्षम् ।

  

It is also a fact that many great works were burnt by म्लेच्छs - the अविच्छिन्नगुरुशिष्यपरम्परा as well as

अविच्छिन्नसम्प्रदाय are also प्रमाणम् ।

  

A suggestion - try to be brief in your answers - we have to be careful about the time of 2,100 members .

  

From my side I close . No more to pen .
