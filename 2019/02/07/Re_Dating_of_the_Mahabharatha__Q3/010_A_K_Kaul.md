Respected Shri Subrahmanianji,

Jai Shri Ram!

There are some "volumes" of Mahabharata Tatparya Nirnaya available on the net but it is a daunting job to locate in them such statements of Madhavacharya as have discussed the starting date of Kaliyuga.

In any case, I will continue my efforts to locate the needle in the haystack!

Thanks for the feedback.

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!
