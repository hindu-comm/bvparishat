Dear Dr. Subrahmanyam Korada,

Jai Shri Ram!

Many thanks for your response, since it always gives me a chance to examine and review my own "findings" or ''inferences" that I may have arrived at!

One thing I must put on record before anything else!

I am neither an atheist, nor an agnostic, nor a renegade, nor an heretic! I am not even an Aryasamajist, much less a hedonist or a "*Charuvakya*"!

I come from a family of *Saraswat Brahmins* of Kashmir where"*Vijayeshwar Jantri*" ---the annual Panchanga---was supposed to be a divine work. My forefathers and parents and even myself believed in predictive astrology and in the horoscope of Bhagwan Ram etc. etc. in an unflinching manner! *Patri Melapak* (matching of horoscopes) is still going on in Kashmiri Pandit community and hardly any matches, if at all any, can take place unless the horoscopes of the boy and the girl match! (How successful such marriages are as compared to the ones that are "not matched astrologically" can be anybody's guess!)  

I cleared Shastri examination from Kashmir University several decades back!  

My grandfather had a library of his own which had quite a few Samskrit works like the four Vedas, the Puranas, the Upanishadas, the Surya Siddhanta and other astronomical works and so on. Most of those works were destroyed during 1990s while we were away from our home and hearth in Srinagar with the result that I had to arrange those very books from several sources later!

Almost all the Kashmiri Pandits believed----and still believe---- that as per the Mahabharata, King Nala was having *Sade-Sati*(the seven and
a half year cycle of Saturn in transits) and that is why he had lost in dice and had to desert his spouse *Damayanti* and suffer ignominy! (Though I could not find any such references in the Mahabharata later when I went through it from cover to cover!)

So we were all mortally afraid of such ''words" as *Ashtama Shani*, *Sade Sati* apart from *Ulka* or *Sankata Dasha* etc. since in Kashmir, *Yogini Dasha* (36 year cycle) instead of *Vimshottari* or *Ashtottari* etc. was followed and that too without any *Bhukta-Bhogya* corrections!

The problem arose when I started comparing *Rashtriya Panchanga* with the data of *Vijayeshwar Jantri!* The two were diametrically opposite to one another! The planetary longitudes differed, the timings of eclipses were different, the dates of festivals were sometimes off even by a day or so and so on!

I was so much fascinated with "*Vijayeshwar Jantri*" that I considered Rashtriya Panchang to be wrong since my maternal grandfather used to make predictions (of course without charging any fees!) from horoscopes prepared from Vijayeshwar Jantri in Sharda Script, and usually those predictions proved correct!

I had no idea till then about *Ayanamsha* or *nirayana-sayana* confusion nor did I know it that *Vijayeshwar* was prepared from Makaranda/Grahalaghava handbooks whereas *Rashtriya Panchanga* through modern astronomy from JPL/NASA with Lahiri Ayanamsha, which is euphemistically also known as Chitra-Paksha!

Almost all the Panchangas from Punjab and other states in Hindi apart from *Vijayeshwar* *Jantri* carried the horoscopes of Ganeshji, Hanumanji, Ravana etc. apart from Bhagwan Ram and Krishna etc. They never "disclosed" the source of their information but the horoscopes were discussed in such a manner as if they had been "lifted" from the scriptures as it is!

I started reading voraciously predictive astrology books in Samskrit, English, Hindi and Urdu apart from the then famous "Astrological Magazine" by Dr. B V Raman.

Since the astrology books/magazines claimed that the horoscopes of Bhagwan Rama and Krishna etc. were taken from the epics and Puranas, I delved quite deep into those books.

And the things got really topsy-turvy there since all the Puranas in one voice talked of an entirely different Rashichakra instead of Lahiri or Raman etc.\\! Same was the case with all the siddhantas including the Surya Siddhanta!

And thereby hangs the tale which will be "narrated" in due course!

That much for the "prologue"!

Now to the points raised by you!

\<Is there any internal evidence in Veda regarding the birth of Veda ? \>

The Vedas, IMHO, are really *"apaurusheya"* i.e. we cannot say as to who "created" them and when i.e. started narrating/reciting the eternal truths that they contain!

E.g., the Gayatri Mantra is supposed to have Vishvamitra Rishi, but that does not mean that he "invented" it! Vishwamitra is not supposed to be a "*mantra-srashta*" but a "*mantra-drashta*" Rishi. It is like Newton's Three Laws of Motion! He just discovered those laws which existed even before Newton! "Every action did have a reaction" even before Newton and will continue to do so! Similarly, "Every body continued to be in the state of rest or of uniform motion unless acted upon by some external forces" even before Newton and will continue to do so for an indefinite number of years and so on! For that matter, Einstein's Theory of General Relativity or "Theory of Special Relativity" were not invented by him but he just could grasp that "eternal" truth about the speed of light and prove it mathematically in a manner that could be comprehended by the whole world! "As a result, he found that space and time were interwoven into a single continuum known as space-time. Events that occur at the same time for one observer could occur at different times for another."

Einstein's world-famous formula E=mc^2 is in fact the bedrock of the system of creation of not only our universe but the entire number of billions and trillions of universes/galaxies and so on which has been adumbrated in our scriptures!

Similarly, when Stephen Hawking said on page 118 of his "The Grand Design"

Quote

The laws of M-theory therefore allow for different universes with different apparent laws, depending on how the internal space is curled. M-theory has solutions that allow for many different internal spaces, perhaps as many as 10^500, which means it allows for 10^500 different universes, **each with its own laws.** To get an idea how many that is, think about this: If some being could analyse the laws predicted for each of those universes in just one millisecond and had started working for it at the big bang at present that being would have done just 10^20 of them and that is without coffee breaks!

Unquote

What Hawking an Agnostic and maybe even an atheist said in 2016 about the innumerable number of universes being there, "each with its own laws" has been explained beautifully in the Yogavasishtha Maharamayana in hundreds of chapters, especially in *Lilopakhyana* and *Pashanopakhyana*etc.Though I know the Yogavasishtha Maharamayana has been around in its present form only for the last about 1500 years, though it claims to have been a discourse between Bhagwan Ram with his teacher*Vasishtha Muni* of Treta-Yuga that is supposed to have occurred at least 900000 years back as per the Surya Siddhanta and the Puranas! But it is immaterial to me since it contains such truths as are really eternal and imperishable!  

(For ready reference and comparison, I am attaching a copy of Hawking's statement together with copies of some pages from the Yogavasishtha Maharamayana---Multiverse)  

Similarly, in my childhood days, in Kashmir, we used to recite from Panchastavi

 ब्रह्माण्ड बुद्बुद संकुलोयं ......

''O Goddess Mahamaya! The innumerable number of universes emanating like bubbles from an ocean get dissolved simply by meditating on you"

Whether it is the *Purusha Sukta* or *Aghamarshana Sukta* or for that matter even the *Naasadiya Sukta* of the Rig Veda, or even the *Shiva Samkalpa Sukta* of the Yajurveda, how and what type of ''internal evidence" can we expect about ''the birth" of such Suktas/mantras the meaning of which baffles even the greatest minds and intellectuals of today!

One of the "Shanti Pathas" in the Vedic lore is:

पूर्णमदः पूर्णमिदं पूर्णात् पूर्णमुदच्यते, पूर्णस्य पूर्णमादाय पुर्नमेवावशिष्य्ते \| \|

ऊं शान्तिः शान्तिः शान्तिः

What type of ''internal evidence" do you expect me to ''decipher" as to when such Acme of the human efforts ''took birth" in such beautiful and pithy statements which can be the envy of any scholar these days!

Similarly, we know that the the obverse of the above "mantra" i.e the following Karika of Mandukya Upanishada is from Acharya Gaudapada of maybe around eighth century!

न निरोधो न चोत्पत्तिर्न बद्धो न च साधकः \|न मुमुक्ष्युर्न वै मुक्त इत्येषा परमार्थता \|\|

As scholars like you can imagine, this is the crux of all the human efforts and knowledge that could have been assimilated over perhaps millions of years! But there is no ''internal evidence" to prove it that way since it was "paraphrased" by Acharya Gaudapada in eight century!

As such, I think we should stop quibbling about ''internal evidence in Veda about the birth of Veda"

As the answer to your very first point has become very long, I will try to answer your other questions in my next mail. Till then, kindly bear with me!

In the meantime, with regards and Jai Shri Ram!
