Gents,

There are 27 nakshatras having 13 degree 20 minute each. There is a 28th nakshatra also named as Abhijeet which is not on zodiac distribution. It is considered as auspicious muhurt also. This nakshatra lies for one ghadi (24 minutes) at Solar Midnight and Solar Noon.

  

The biggest example of this nakshatra can be refered with Independence of India. India got independence at midnight of 14/15 August 1947 because there was no other auspicious muhurt.
