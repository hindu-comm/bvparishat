Namaste

  

I am addressing some of the points raised by Avatar Krishna Kaul.



1\.   On \< The field has already been explored!.... You can draw your own conclusions as to how far we can rely on astrological charts whether from the SS or from modern astronomy or not-so-modern-astronomy!> .

  

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**BVK Sastry**: Your post attacks several accepted positions, currently alive in practice and accepted by scholars and practitioners. You have made some serious statements and allegations about Sri Vinay Jha and Surya Siddhanta. I have personal acquaintance with Sri vinay Jha and his position on 'Grahas as Devatas' and efficacy of 'Vaidika Yajans' as pariharas (remedial measure) for 'Graha/ graha-chara doshas'. He has his clarity on the software and interpretation of the source original works. So did Dr. B V Raman had a clarity on ' Parashari' and other systems on which he has presented the publications. PVN Rao of J Hora is also one of my good acquaintance.

  

Some of these later writers have used 'computer softwares' for convenience of calculation. But the primary basis is still the 'original works which were composed in Samskrutham (the language grammar of which is more than 2500 years old) much earlier period, way before computers were deployed for Astrology software runs. 

  

It may be worth while to explore how Hubble Telescope is deeply connected with the basic question of 'Creation in Time' which is deeply connected with the understanding of Samskruth terms: 'Yuga- Yugaadi- Yuga-kshaya / Pralaya' concepts. and why ' 6000 years divider line' is ridiculous for Jyotish based Historical dates.

2\. On \< The Vedas, judging from the astronomical data/details there, cannot be claimed to be older than 10000 BCE in any case. Besides, conditions of the human race even about 10000 BC were not favourable/conducive for lofty and pithy eternal truths enshrined in the Vedic lore! .... SS is a concoction of the worst order "invented" by someone for making a fool of the gullible public of Bharatavarsha!..........I was literally shocked to learn that there was no mention of Mangal, Shani etc. planets, much less the dreaded Kalasarpa-Yoga "planets" Rahu-Kethu in the Vedas. ...... Similarly, Mesha, Vrisha etc. Rashis are conspicuous by their absence from the Vedas and the Vedangas! .... request them to tell this forum if they have come across any Mangal, Shani etc. planets or Mesha, Vrisha etc. Rashis in the Vedas! .... It means that the real Vamadevas and Vishwamitras were practicing some kind of "predictive astrology"----if
at all they practiced it---sans the Rashis and planets! Thus IMHO by ascribing the fad of peeping into future to the Vedic seers, that also on the shoulders of inanimate planets and imaginary twelve divisions of the ecliptic known as Rashis, we are just under-estimating their real knowledge though we call them sarvajnyas at the same time and in the same breath!!

  

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**BVK Sastry**: Too many confusions and complex issues !

  

First point: You are confused on what and why of 'Vedas', 'Vedangas' and 'Upa-Veda /Veda- Viniyoga in Karma-Kanda' for 'Daiva - vypashraya chikitsa'.

  

It would be good point for some body's research on 'pedagogy of 'Vedas (Darshan) to practical utility applications ( Ayurveda, Jyotisha :: 
Upaveda and Vedanga). What we have today is the connected continuity of texts -traditions and practices.

  

If the language:Samskrutham is the common continuing language of all these texts- traditions, and Samskrutham has shown to be a rule based stable language used across all texts of Upaveda and Vedanga's, and study of Samskrutham is distorted in current period (since translations from colonial period), How does one pass a judgement on the source works ?? How does one superimpose the current understanding on a past period ? Expect Vedas to be 'a technical manual for computers and bio-chemistry at the same time', taking the statement 'Vedas are source of all knowledge' ??

  

**So, the right step would be go back to base , basics of Text, Tradition and Language ! **

  

---------------------------------------



3\. On \< The Surya Siddhanta, since it pretended to have been "talking" in the fag end of the last Krita Yga, ..... The SS has however, "arranged" the planetary calculations in such a manner that after every 1080000 years, they converge at zero degrees, with the result that the mean longitudes of planets as per the SS are zero for the midnight of February 17/18, 3102 BCE---that too for Ujjain and that too for Ujaain Mean Time!

Aryabhata had used the same longitudes in his initial work "Aryabhata Siddhanta" and started Kaliyuga from February 17/18 midnight, like that of the SS, but later changed his mind to make it start from 6-00 am on February 18, 3102 BCE! .... Varahamaiira had in his Pancha-Siddhantika XV/20 castigated Aryabhata for saying at one place that Kaliyuga started at midnight but at another place that it started at sunrise!>

  

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**BVK Sastry**: So, you place on record that traditional astronomers/ astrologers were not having a concurrent position and reference frame. Pl. provide specific outline for 'Panchanga' - 'Ganita' researchers to explore more closely and come out with a comparative study on the texts, to track the 'Veda Jyotisha' which 'Parashara- Vyasa - Vamadadeva- Viswamitra used for 'Time- Divining'.
