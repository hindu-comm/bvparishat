Namaste AK kaul

  

What exactly are you trying to communicate and prove in this thread? Are you tracing historicity of rashis or findind faults or proposing new theory ?

  

1\. If you want to prove every current practice of panchaga/s based celebration of Navratri ( vasant or sharat), samkramanas are off the mark, then the debating issue is the ‘ ayanamsha- ganitha’.  This ganitha calculation does not tell any one to observe yugadi as a new year or samkranti as a sacred time for bath or perform yajna etc; on a specific constellation and moon association.

  

What to do on a particular time as yajna or japa or tithi- shraadha, comes from a different discipline. Your charge reading

\< because of our fatal infatuation with niraadhaar niraayana, we are celebrating all our festivals and muhurtas on wrong days, so much so that the entire Hindu fraternity will be celebrating Vasanti Navratris-cum-Ugadi-cum-Chaitri Navratra-cum-Gudi Padva from April 6, 2019----when more than two-thirds of Vasanta Ritu will already be over.

**The actual Navratra have started from today i.e. Thursday, March 7, 2019! \> is an objection on the timing. And not on ‘ celebration’ itself.**

**

**2. Coming to ayanamsha figure, panchanga variations, these are subject scholarship and opinion debates. If you are not happy with some others position, be polite and say so. There is no need to fight and make a hue and cry. Propse how 07 march 2019 per ganith calculation meets the dharmashastra conditions for yugadi and time- mystics called punya-kaala.**

**  
**

**3. Last but not least, please keep trail mail clean. It helps to keep focus. I am leaving trail mail as it is for last time.**
