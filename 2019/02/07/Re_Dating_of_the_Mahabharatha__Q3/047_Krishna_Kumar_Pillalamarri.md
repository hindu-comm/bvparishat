This is a correct date. For proof, please read 'A plot in Indian Chronology', by Sri Kota Venkatachalam, published in 1952, and reprinted recently. Sri Venkatachalam correctly identifies the perfidity of 'Sir' William Jones in arbitrarily dating Mahabharata war, and authoritatively deriving the correct date as 3138 B.C. Krishna niryaaNam was in 3102 B.C., as stated in this plaque. Ref: "The Plot in Indian Chronology", Kali Saka 5054, A.D 1052, Durga Publications, Hyderabad.

  

By the way, the writer was Sringeri Peethadhipati as well. The book is in English, so all of you can easily refer to it.  

  

Best Regards,
