Dear Sri Kaul,

  

I am no expert at all in the dating of the MB or the start of the Kali Yuga. I have heard that Sri Madhvacharya has made some statements regarding the Kali yuga, etc. while stating his own date in his Mahabharata Tatparya Nirnaya. I have not studied that. Madhva scholars have relied upon his statements to calculate his date. Maybe if there is any English publication that covers this topic that would interest you in the Kali prarambha nirnaya.

  

warm regards
