Namaste



1. The crux of discussion is \< Thus the million dollar question is as to when the Kaliyuga started actually!\>



 And resolving this issue depends on understanding the term ' yuga'! 

What does this Samskruth Language Term mean! 

What did the term mean when it was used thousands of years ago ?



2. There are options in exploring what the 'yuga' - Samskruth term-
meaning analytics.

Term-Meaning analytics covers five different unified analytics in Samskrutham. They are:

 (2.1) Vyutpatti ( Derivation) ,(2.2) Nirukti- Kosha ( Meaning
Extraction and lexicon listing) , (2.3) Prakriyaa ( Word form fixation through rules of grammar processing) , (2.4) Paribhashaa (Technical domain specific meaning) , (2.5) Prayoga ( usage in context).



What approach is to be taken to fix the Samskruth term meaning? And in this ' yuga' case, Do we go by context of planetary position, as on date of war ? Or narratives that occured on the battle field, as per
description of the term in Bhagavad-gita , said to be discourse on the battle field just before the commencement of war ?



Should one go by the Gregorian model of years or one of the eighteen Jyotisha siddhantas spread over some 2000 years or more?



2a) Vedanga Jyotish (1400 BCE) indigenous approach is seen mixed with
Dharma Shastra models of ' Four yugas', under which ' Kali yuga' comes in. Here goes the Aryabhatiya reference, leading to \< February 18, 3102 BCE as the start of Kaliyuga> . Conclusion simply is Nobody knows as to when the kaliyuga started ! 



2b) Follow what Srimad Bhagavad gita (8-17), which is said to be dialogue-discourse on Mahabharata - Kurukshetra war-filed ; where we find the reference of Yuga time measure, specifically mentioning the ' Vedanga Jyotisha tradition as ' aho-raatra vido janah':

sahasra-yuga-paryantam, ahar yad brahmano viduh ; ratrim yuga-sahasrantam te 'ho-ratra-vido janah \|\| 



Close on the heels of this, we have Yuga-Purana / Hari-Vamsha where in this 'time' cycles are explained more clearly in relation to Jyotisha !
THE Y UGA-P URANA AND THE TREATISES OF GARGA : The Yuga-Purdna appears as a chapter within a work on jyotisa ("astrology" in its widest sense, or the study of natural phenomena), whose author is stated to be either Garga or Vrddha-Garga ("the elder Garga"). 

( <https://archive.org/stream/TheYugaPurana/The%20Yuga%20Purana_djvu.txt>; <http://vedicilluminations.com/downloads/Mahabharata/Harivamsa/hvapp0707.txt>)

This model leads to different mind boggling time scale of several thousands of years ! (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_units_of_time>) (<https://www.bhagavad-gita.us/bhagavad-gita-8-17/>)



3. These references, for a land-people events history, need a proper understanding of the 'Yoga' model of 'Samskruth Language'. The ' dhatu's linked to the term 'yuga' and contextual interpretation of the same may hold the key to resolve the issue.



4. The interesting side question for research would be :

 Did Vedanga jyotisha teams use different measures of time associated to the term ' yuga' in the works from 1400 C.E to 449 A.D ?

 Are current Jyotisha software's providing a historic time cycle calculation and sky maps of early period constructed to be in tune with the texts of Vedanga jyotisha ??



 There is a serious research required. This could change the way ' Indology (Swadeshi and Anya-deshi) is understood.

This is where that ' Yoga way of understanding Samskruth terms becomes critical'.

This 'Samskruth Language Modeling' is missing in the current
'Classical - oriental- conversational modes of Sanskrit learning'. While each approach is having its utility, they cannot over rule or substitute other model.
