Namaste Kaul



The summary point you are making is : \< That proves it conclusively that even around fifth/sixth century BCE, Mesha etc. Rashis were not ''available" in India!>.



Here is the line of thinking i suggest you to explore as research:



The grouping of rashi's with nine-paadas of nakshatra, and graha-adhipatya is a standing practice in Vednaga jyotisha. 

When did this grouping start with specific nomenclature ? is the question to investigate. 



Indian stand is : It has been there as a part of Vedanga Jyotisha, ever since.

You want to show that it is post 5/6th century BCE. using the argument: \< There are no references in Dharma Shaastra works and the like>.



Please note that the names ' mesha, vrushabha..meena' are NOTATIONS (Samjnaa) of VEDNAGA JYTOISHA. So one needs to look at the source books and SAMJNAA prakaranam for the Vedanga Jyotisha. Please explore how Varahamihira gives the slokas for the rashi names and work backwards, as to where from he got it. and why he associates it with Vedanga Jyotisha. You will surely get the answer.



Explore link <https://archive.org/details/jyotisha/page/n17> and sloka 4 to 8 : Raashi prabheda adhyaaya. Varahamihira did not come up suddenly with the notations and no reasoning. Please explore the same before going on \< attacks \>.



Also explore <https://archive.org/details/Brihatsamhita>.
