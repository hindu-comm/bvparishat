Namaste



(To keep focus on the point in your mail, I am taking out the trail mail portions; and it saves the time in reading the response).



Yuga-kshaya is both conceptual as well as ' real religion practice in Vedic tradition'. It is to be understood as ' Transition from one stage to another'- say from gruhastha to vanaprastha. It is a beginning of new togetherness , an end of previous togetherness.



From the discussions it is amply clear that the term ' yuga' has multilayered interpretation ; and in this context, it is on the TIME-SCALE ( KAALA - MAANA ) , a numeric measure of time -period.



 From this perspective, 'yuga- kshaya' is to be understanding as roll back of TIME to the Next- Zero point in the cyclic model. ( Or in a sine wave completion of one cycle trending from 1 towards zero; and heading to the next marked beginning of 1). The vedic tradition uses the Kaala- Chakra / yuga- chakra model to provide its terminology and teachings. The linear time thinkers fail to see the value of the cyclic model. ( See Gita: **evam pravartitam chakram** nanuvartayatiha yah, aghayur indriyaramo mogham partha sa jivati : BG 3.16). 



 Different schools of Vedic tradition pick on the ' chakra' - cycle
and analyze it for right action in right time ( kaala- dharma ( Changing times) / kaala- karma ( Appropriate action for the time) ::
dharma - kaala (Samskaara - samaya) / karma-kaala ( Muhurta)



 In this model, end of dwapara yuga would be the beginning of Kali-yuga.



 This may be characterized as ' dwaapara yuga-kshaya; kaliyuga- praarambha' :: End of Dwapara yuga cycle - beginning of Kaliyuga
cycle'.

The descending node of time is iconically illustrated as ' the Dharma-Cow losing one leg (25% support) in each changing cycle.



*Why mark the time cycle ? -* It is a measure of changes in the
practice of Ten Values of Dharma in society ( or say the Cosmos. This may be too much to comprehend, or accept. so we limit this to the local land -community context.) In this sense, yuga-kshaya means ' Change in the Togetherness, the dynamic eco system in which the life progresses, loss of togetherness'. In Valmiki's model, the separation of male and female birds due to the intervention of hunters act ( kraucha dvandva viyoga ; vadha of partner is yuga- kshaya). 



*What are markers for the time cycle ? - *(i) The inner tendency (Swabhaava) observance of 'Dharma'; (ii) the potential (Sattva, Veerya) of people to perceive and pursue Yoga-Dharma for Higher values of life (iii) the ability to become a ' mantra drashtaa ( rushi) in ones life time. 



Due to these changes, the ' role, purpose and teaching of 'avatara's', the guidance for good living keep changing. This is dynamics of Dharma-Shaastra in different yuga cycles.

This is ' CONTEXTUALIZATION' of Teaching- Instruction; It is NOT a new rule to overrule the previous version.

**

*What is our time cycle in relation to given ' yuga-kshaya' like Dwaapara yuga end ? -* This is used in the ' declaratory statement ( poojaa samkalpa) in every rite of passage. It is a recognition of Time and changing realities.



This wisdom is lost due to the failure of the performing parties to understand and contemplate on the Samskruth statements. and the failure of ' Education pedagogy in Training the Purohita's to a requisite level of proficiency in the language of the sacred text.



Abrahamic religions have two models to address this social problem : (i) X-ian model: Translate and define-dilute interpret the scripture
in language of society (ii) Jewish and Islamic models:- Society Trains and supports well being of the Scholar of Text , language and Practice. ( No dilution or severance of language from society). 



In the last three hundred years of 'Hinduism by colonial Oriental Sanskrit standards', the ' Scholar, the consumer, the society of Vedic Documents' have caused irreparable damage to what survived as a standard over at least for five millennia ( Valmiki to Acharya Madhwa and his disciple Vadiraja during Vijayanagar empire ! This is ' (deva-Bhashaa- Yuga- Kshaya). or loss of Vak-Yoga pedagogy of Panini-Patanjali- Yaska in Samskruth studies.

Dr BVK,

So there is conceptual understanding of **युगक्षय.**

Now the question is to locate any descriptive understanding.

Valmiki uses: excessive expansion of the sun, large clouds.

Looks like astronomical speculations.

So my interest is to look how it is characterized.

BM,
