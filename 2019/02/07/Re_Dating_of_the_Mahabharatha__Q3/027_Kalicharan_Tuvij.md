Namaste.  
  
Simple checks of consistency are able to reveal if someone writing about something in humanities is worthy of respect/ attention or not.  
Yavana-s in general fail this test. The reason is that their quest - be it scientific or humanities related - has been propelled by a singular goal: "the elimination of the other". I'd rather go so far as to say that this deep (and unique) motivation is what defines the term "yavana".  
Amid ourselves we have a set of confused lot (NRI's leading the eminent charge) who avidly believe in the virtues of science (a sword can be used to chop vegetable, no?) without having delved in its true depths (at the most only attaining some excellence in a especiality such as Engineering which is a mediocre field at best).  
People from such fields should remember that Sanskrit goes deeper (than their training helps them access), and without first hand delving in Sanskrit (not Paninian necessarily) no real contribution (if that be the motivation) can be made.  
Coming to the topic at hand, i.e. the dating of Mahabharata, I have not come across any serious challenge to the 3000 BC time window for the epic.  
Shri Nilesh Oak as I understand has done some good research that clearly demonstrates the awareness of the effects of precession in the Mahabharata era. (This lends credence to the view that Hindu Panchanga actively makes use of precession.)  
However, his own plot on Arundhati shows a sharp curve in the 3000 BC window validating the observation made in Mahabharata in the same span. Unsurprisingly he erred because he relied on others' translation of the text.  
पृष्ठतः need not mean "behind". The correct translation is "showing its back". In a couple the most inauspicious position would be "the male showing his back to the female".  
This is also somewhat corroborated by accounts (कलियुगी no doubt) from certain other cultures depicting the couple as "rider on the horse back" with Vashishtha being the horse.  
  
  
P.S.  
To those on the atheist/ agnostic bent reading this, I would say it is perhaps time to accept 3000 BC setting for the epic (even if the "story" was concocted by some insanely clever person in, say, 1000 AD).  
More than this personally I am not interested in splitting hairs about the exact times and dates in Mahabharata.  
  
Thank you
