Sir

I would like to add one more point to the observation of Sri Korada.

  

Why should the Veda have reference to Mangal, Sani or Kalasarpa Dosha?

You have to take what is in the Veda but not come to the conclusion that as the Veda had not mentioned it the seers of that time did not know about it. Because the purpose of the Veda is not to supply dates and names to the so called researchers of 21st century AD. If there are references, we have to take them, if not we have to look elsewhere.

Who said that during the time of the Ramayana human beings were as they are now etc. Rama himself was described to be a seven footer. How often do you find such a person in India or for that in the world?

That is what we believe and accept, For the simple reason our seers had no personal interest in concocting history or spreading lies about themselves.

  

Regards

S R Ivaturi
