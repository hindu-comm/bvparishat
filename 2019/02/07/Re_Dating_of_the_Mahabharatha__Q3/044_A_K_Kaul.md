Dr. BVKS,

Jai Shri Ram!

\<The summary point you are making is : \<That proves it conclusively that even around fifth/sixth century BCE, Mesha etc. Rashis were not ''available" in India!>.

Very true!

\<Please note that the names ' mesha, vrushabha..meena' are NOTATIONS (Samjnaa) of VEDNAGA JYTOISHA. So one needs to look at the source books and SAMJNAA prakaranam for the Vedanga Jyotisha>

I am really amused to see all this confusion about "search for Mesha, Vrisha etc. Rashis in the Vedas"!

The *Chhandogya Upanishad*, a part of the *Talwakar Brahmana* of the Sama Veda, has said in 1/7/2

ऋग्वेदं भगवोअद्येमियजुर्वेदं सामवेदमाथर्वणम् चतुर्थं इतिहासपुराणं पञ्चमं.....

''O respected sir, I have memorized the Rigveda, the Yajurveda, the Samaveda and the fourth Atharva Veda. (Besides, I have also memorized) *Itihasa-Purana*, i.e. the epics and Puranas which are the fifth Veda"!

And all the Puranas whether the Srimad Bhagavata or Vishnu Purana or
Vamana Purana or Narada Purana or Shiva Maha Purana or Linga Purana or Devi Bhagavata or Devi Purana or Vishnudharmottarapurana and so on and so foth---i.e. the fifth Veda--- declare from the housetops that Mesha Samkranti is the day of Vernal Equinox, Karka Samkranti the day of Summer Solstice, Tula Samkranti the day of Autumn Equinox and Makar Samkranti the day of Winter Solstice and so on!  

Pl. see the attachments galore in support of the same!

May I know why we have such a disdain for the Rashis of the "Panchama Veda" which are scattered in all the Puranas? Why then are we "hunting" for non-existent Lahiri or Ramana etc. Rashis in every nook and corner?

I have also proved it times without number that whether it is the Surya Siddhanta or Brahma Sphuta Siddhanta or the Siddhanta Shiromani, all are talking of nothing but a so called Sayana Rashichakra! (attachment SS-)

As far as the "Vedanga Jyotisham" goes, pl. note that as per the third mantra of *Yajusha Jyotisham* (36th mantra of *Archa-jyotisham*), **"jyotisham" does not mean predictive astrology but the methodology of calculation of proper timings for yajnyas!**

The same thing has been repeated by the last siddhantakara viz. Bhaskaracharya-II as back as 12th century AD in his Siddhanta Shiromani! (Pl. see attachment Bhaskaracharya Jyotish")  

In his commentary on the above mantra of the *Chhandogya Upanishada*, the Aadi Shankara has termed Nakshatra Vidya as Jyotisham! Obviously, it means calculation of proper nakshatras for performing Yajnyas!  

\<The grouping of rashi's with nine-paadas of nakshatra, and graha-adhipatya is a standing practice in Vednaga jyotisha.

When did this grouping start with specific nomenclature ? is the question to investigate.\>

I have done a lot of "investigation" about it already!

As per the attachment Vamanapu-1 the twenty-seven nakshatras have been apportioned to Mesha etc. Rashis in a sequential order, exactly as desired by you! However, as per the attachment vamana-pu.jpeg, the same Karkata Rashi is said to be the start of Dakshinayana and Makara Samkranti that of Uttarayana! What does it prove? That even the nakshatra divisions are to be subsumed in so called sayana i.e. seasonal rashis!  

***Even divine incarnations are subject to niraadhaar niraayana faux pas!***

On page 2 of his "Notable Horoscopes" Dr. B V Raman had quoted Srimad Bhagavata 10/3/1, Vishnu Purana /1/26 and Harivamsha 1/52 as the source of his information that "Bhagwan Krishna was born in dark half of Shravana Krishna Ashtami in the constellation of Rohini at midnight" and Dr. Raman had calculated His birth chart accordingly! Ironically, again, it was not calculated either from the Surya Siddhanta or from the Siddhanta Shiromani etc. but in the words of Dr. Raman himself,

Quote

I must acknowledge my indebtedness to my friend Mr. Cyril Fagan of Dublin for his unstinting help. He has calculated for me, several of the ancient horoscopes given in this book; in some cases, each horoscope several times".

Unquote

And Cyril Fagan had calculated it---and other "ancient horoscopes" through modern astronomy, of course, and that too so called sayana, with only the Ramana Ayanamsha tonsure having been done for the purpose of proving that Ayanamsha to be correct!

But what is surprising and even ironic is that all these "sources" are talking of nothing but a so called sayana Rashichakra! E.g the Srimad Bhagavata has said at 5/21/4-6

यदा मेषतुलयोर्वर्तते तदाहोरात्राणि समानानि भवन्ति यदा वृषभादिषु पञ्चसु च राशिषु चरति तदाहान्येव वर्धन्ते ह्रसति च मासिमास्येकैका घटिका रात्रिषु \| यदा वृश्चिकादिषु पञ्चसु वर्तते तदाहोरात्राणि विपर्ययानि भवन्ति \|
यावद् दक्षिणायनं अहानि वर्धन्ते यावदुदगयनं रात्रयः \|\|

"...When the sun is in Mesha and Tula, days and nights are equal. When it passes through the five Rashis of Vrishabha etc., days go on increasing and nights decreasing. In Dakshinayana, it is the reverse.
Till Dakshinayana, days go on increasing and then till Uttarayana, nights go on increasing"

Then in 5/22/5, we read

अथ स एष आत्मा लोकानां द्यावा पृथ्व्योरन्तरेण नभोवलयस्य कालचक्रगतो द्वादश मासान्भुङ्क्ते राशि संज्ञान् संवत्सरावयवान् मासः पक्षद्वयं दिवा नक्तं चेति सपादर्क्ष्यद्वयमुपदिशन्तियावता शष्ठमंशं भुञ्जीत स वै
ऋतुरित्युपदिश्य्ते संवत्सराव्यवः \|\|

"The sun-god, who is the soul of the worlds, mounted on the wheel of time, which is poised in the upper air, midway between earth and heaven, passes through the twelve months that make up the year and are known by the names of the different zodiacal signs. The month consists of two fortnights, the dark and the bright, according to the lunar reckoning.
*And in the course of one month the sun transits the space occupied by two nakshatras (constellations) and a quarter.* The period he takes to traverse one-sixth of the length of the zodiac is called a season, another division of a year".(N Raghunathan translation)

As to what type of Rashichakra the Vishnu-purana is talking about, pl. see the attachment VP-rashis2, which talks of nothing but a seasonal Rashichakra in the following words:  

तुला मेष गते भानौ समरात्रि दिनं तु तत् \|कर्कटावस्थिते भानौ दक्षिणायनं उच्यते \| उत्तरयायनमप्युक्तम् मकरस्थे दिवाकरे \|

''When the sun is in Mesha or Tula, the days and nights are equal. When it enters Karkata, that is the start of Dakshinayana and with entrance into Makara, it is known as Uttarayana"

About "Harivamsha", which is a part of the Mahabharata, there are no Mesha etc. Rashis, whether so called sayana or nirayana! But it does talk of Ayanas and Vishuvas!

Thus it is a mystery as to how Dr. Raman could prepare a horoscope of Bhagwan Krishna on the basis of his beloved "Ramana Rashichakra" which is astronomically non-existent and has not been touched by any Purana or siddhanta even with a barge pole!

All the more surprising is the fact that Dr. Raman had correlated the events of Bhagwan Krishna's life to such a non-existent Rashichakra meticulously!

And same is the case with other ''astrologers" who have delineatedHis chart as per Lahiri or any other niraadhar niraayana rashichakras galore!

What also pains me is that a scholar like you is "searching" for such non-existent Rasichakras galore in the Vedanga Jyotisha, which has not referred to any Rashi even by mistake!

\<Please explore how Varahamihira gives the slokas for the rashi names and work backwards, as to where from he got it. and why he associates it with Vedanga Jyotisha. You will surely get the answer.

Explore link<https://archive.org/details/jyotisha/page/n17> and sloka 4 to 8 : Raashi prabheda adhyaaya. Varahamihira did not come up suddenly with the notations and no reasoning. Please explore the same before going on \< attacks \>.

Varahamihira was around in sixth century AD. that is about 1100 years after 6th century BCE! The Surya Siddhanta, the earliest Rashi based ''astronomical" work is of early centuries of CE. That means much water had flown under the Ganges from 5th century BCE till then!

This is what Varahamihira has said in 3/2 of his Brihat Samhita

सांप्रतं अयनं सवितुः कर्कटाद्य्म् मृगादितश्चान्य्त\|

"The sun turns South (Dakshinayana - Summer Solstice) when it enters Karkata and it turns towards North (Uttarayana - Winter Solstice) when it enters Capricorn (Makara Rashi)"

The Vamana Purana has said exactly the same thing in 2/16/12

ततो दिवाकरो रात्रिं संप्रयाति च कर्कटम् \| ततो अमराणां रजनीभवति दक्षिणायनम्

"The sun enters then Karkata Rashi, which is the start of the six months' night of gods, known as Dakshinaayana".

Varahamihira has also said in Panchasiddhantika 3/21 साम्प्रतम् अयनं पुनर्वसुतः i.e. "Presently the Dakshinayana starts from (the last quarter of) Punarvasu". And since the Vamana Purana also has said in an earlier Adyaya that last quarter of Punarvasu falls in the start of Karkata Rashi, it means both are repeating one and the same thing!

It could have happened only either if Varahamihira and Vamana Purana had been contemporaneous, or as an alternative, both of these works are referring to such phenomena which take place always like that according to them!

That means both of them are so called saayana---following a seasonal year and months and even nakshatras!

Since the Vamana Purana says that Makar Samkranti is the shortest day of the year and at the same time it says that Makar Samkranti coincided with the sun in Uttarashadha nakshatra, it means that it has absolutely no knowledge of precession! 

Regarding Makar Samkranti, it was the shortest day of the year as per Varahamihira (Panchasiddhantika III/24) also

उदगयनं मकरादावृतवः शिशिरादयश्च सूर्यवशात् \|\|द्विभवन कालसमानं
दक्षिणं अयनंच कर्कटात्

"The sun's turning northward is when it reaches the zero point of Makara (Capricorn) i.e at winter solstice, and its turning southward is at the zero point of Karkata (Cancer) i.e. at summer solstice, with the attendant sacred days. The seasons Shishira etc. commence with the winter solstice and each season lasts two tropical months".

The most interesting thing about Varahamihira is that he expected the Winter Solstice to coincide always with Makar samkranti and Karkata Samkranti with Dakshinayana - Summer Solstice as otherwise there would
be nothing but chaos.

In his Brihat Samhita, Aadityachaara Adyaaya, he has said

अप्राप्य मकरमर्को विनिवृत्तो हन्ति सापरां याम्यां \| कर्कटकमसंप्राप्तो विनिवृत्तश्चोत्तरां सैन्द्रीं \|\|4\|\|

उत्तरमयनमतीत्य व्यावृत्तः क्षेमसस्य वृद्धिकरः\| प्रकृतिस्थश्चाप्येवम् विकृत गतिर्भयकृदुष्णांशुः\|\|5\|\|

''If the sun should change his course before reaching Makara (Capricornus) he will bring evil on the West and South. And if he should do so before reaching Karkata (Cancer), he will bring evil on the north and the east!  

The sun when he changes his course from north to south and when in his usual condition will bring on prosperity and increase of crops; but when he undergoes a change in his usual course or his appearance,itcauses fear to mankind"

Whether it was ''almighty" Lahiri Makar Samkranti or Ramana Makar Samkranti or even Surya Siddhanta (calculated) Makar Samkranti, it could never coincide with Uttarayana, nor could Dakshinayana coincide with Karkata Samkranti at the time of Varahamaira! Since the SS calculated Samkrantis did not coincide with the Solstices, Vararhamahira was getting panicky as earlier ''astrologers" like Garga and Parashara
etc. had said

as per page 23 of Brihat-Samhita translation by Vidvan Subrahmanya Sastri and Vidwan M Ramakrishna Bhatt

  

यदा निवर्ततेअप्राप्तो धनिष्ठंत्तरायणे \| आश्लेषां दक्षिनेअप्राप्तस्तदा विद्यान्महद्भयम्

यद्यप्राप्तो वैष्णवमुदग्मार्गं प्रपद्यते \| दक्षिनमाश्लेषां वा महाभयाय \|\|  

So Varahamihira was following in their footsteps!

\<You will surely get the answer.>

I had the answers already and have been trying to share the same with other members of this august forum!

Anyway, the tail piece is that because of our fatal infatuation with niraadhaar niraayana, we are celebrating all our festivals and muhurtas on wrong days, so much so that the entire Hindu fraternity will be celebrating Vasanti Navratris-cum-Ugadi-cum-Chaitri Navratra-cum-Gudi Padva from April 6, 2019----when more than two-thirds of Vasanta Ritu will already be over.  

**The actual Navratra have started from today i.e. Thursday, March 7, 2019!**

With my best wishes for the Navratras,

Avtar Krishen Kaul
