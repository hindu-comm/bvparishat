Dear Dr BVK,

While I appreciate your explanations, I might sound like a complaining person.

My quest is to locate any text that might talk about astronomical phenomena

connected with the \< Yuga-Kshaya>. We are seeing the description of water

(a terrestrial phenomenon) in the Bhagavatam.  

I thank all who wrote. Let me check what I can find. I will report if I succeed.

People may research if they have interest in astrophysical phenomena.  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
