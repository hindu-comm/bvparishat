Dear Shri Vijay Mishraji,

Jai Shri Ram!

वृद्धिः and क्षय are relative terms. E.g, we often find mention of तिथि क्षय or वृद्धिः in panchangas.

If there is a tithi kshay, it means no new tithi is being formed between two sunrises. But since the timings of sunrise differ from place to place, there is every possibility that if some tithi has "decayed" in say Srinagar, Kashmir, it may not be necessarily so in Chennai and vice-versa.

Similarly, when there are no New Moons (Amantas) between two solar Sankrantis, it is known as a क्षय मास. Though kshyaya masa is astronomically almost impossible since the solar months are longer than synodic months, but a few centuries back such "phenomena" did occur because of defective astronomical karna works like Graha Laghava or Makarand and so on. Similarly, with myriad Ayanamshas floating around, two nirayana sankrantis may occur in some far off future date without an Amanta (New Moon) because of some freak Ayanamsha!

Regarding युग क्षय, since we do not know astronomically for certainty as to which yuga started/ended when, if at all any new yuga has started/ended, such terms as yuga-kshyay and vriddhi are in the realm of speculation.

Besides, as per Aryabhata the duration of each yuga is 1,080,000 solar years, whereas according to the Surya Siddhanta and almost all the other siddhantas they are in the ratio 1:2:3:4.

It means some SS yuga has already become a "क्षय yuga" as per Aryabhata and vice-versa!

Obviously, युगक्षये has been used as a figurative term by Maharshi Valmiki and so on.

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!
