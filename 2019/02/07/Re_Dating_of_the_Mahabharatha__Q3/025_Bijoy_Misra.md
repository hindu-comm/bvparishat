Dear Sri Shankara,

You have a search engine at your finger tips. Let me digest.

Possibly ice age, flood and water was known through the old  

legends. If they would make dissolution, then the recreation

would not be done by tapa as Bhagavatam would say (so I think).

Let me study.

Thank you for your perpetual scholarly help.
