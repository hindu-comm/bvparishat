Nagrajji,  

They are all designed to create time scales from observational astronomy.

Sky map does change as seen from earth and we can put various time scales

when the maps repeat. It is a function of earth's orbital in the galactic axis.  

युगक्षय on the other hand possibly would refer to dissolution not the cycle of time.

The concept is there in श्रीमद्भागवतम् but I had not seen the description of

the expansion of sun. They call प्रलय, everything is submerged etc, which is

not a bad geophysical concept. But युगक्षय as used (it seems) would refer to

the dissolution of the solar system which possibly is called महाप्रलय.

We may look for a description if we can find.

  

While we talk of Valmiki, we must commend his command on astronomy.

To be a poet in the old days must have needed large preparation. not just

ideas!
