Avtar,  
For your perusal here is a reference from Mahabharat about Zodiac:  
Udyog Parv 5.47  
  
उच्चावचं थैवयुक्तं रहस्यं; थिव्याः परश्ना मृगचक्रा मुहूर्ताः  
कषयं महान्तं कुरुसृञ्जयानां; निवेथयन्ते पाण्डवानां जयं च \[5.47.93\]  
  
"Capable of explaining the mysteries of the Gods and of answering  
questions regarding coming events, understanding the signs of  
the zodiac, prophesying the great overthrow of the kuru and the  
Srinjaya and the triumph of the Pandav." \[5.47.93\]  
  
In this shloka zodiac and predictions of future are mentioned.  
  
Dhritrashtr also consults rishis to know his sons' future.  
  
And Gita is all about future prediction to Arjun by Krishn himself.  
  
RgVed mentions all 27 nakshatras. It knows 13 solar months including the intercalary month which gets dropped to keep calendars in sync.  
  
In my humble opinion if we approach a topic with a sense of enquiry we might learn more but if the idea is to show absence of this and that we might not learn that much.  
  
Shivraj
