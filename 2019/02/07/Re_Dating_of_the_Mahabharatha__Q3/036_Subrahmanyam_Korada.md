नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

Dear Vid Kaul

  

  

\>The Vedas, judging from the astronomical data/details there, cannot be claimed to be older than 10000 BCE in any case. Besides, conditions of the human race even about 10000 BC were not favourable/conducive for lofty and pithy eternal truths enshrined in the Vedic lore! \<

  

Is there any internal evidence in Veda regarding the birth of Veda ?

  

  

\>As clarified already several times, I was literally shocked to learn that there was no mention of Mangal, Shani etc. planets, much less the dreaded Kalasarpa-Yoga "planets" Rahu-Kethu in the Vedas.  

Similarly, Mesha, Vrisha etc. Rashis are conspicuous by their absence from the Vedas and the Vedangas!At least, I have not come across any such "planets" or "Rashis" in the Vedas and since this august forum consists of eminent scholars most of whom must have gone through the entire Vedic lore, I would request them to tell this forum if they have come across any Mangal, Shani etc. planets or Mesha, Vrisha etc. Rashis in the Vedas! \<

  

Did you check all 1130 Branches of Veda , if so when and where ?

  

In Vedangas there is no mention of Mesh etc ?

  

Mangala , Sani etc , names of planets are not there in Veda (available ) ? Are you sure ?

  

\>Regarding the "ruling period" of Dasharatha, it is a moot point as to how we find the mention of Rashis and "Gochara" in the Valmiki Ramayana when they are absent from a much later work viz. the Mahabharata! Could they be a later day addition in the Valmiki Ramayana? \<  

  

So you mean to say that unless and until it it mentioned in later works ( even without context) you do not want to believe in the horoscope of Rama in Valmikiramayana ? What kind of logic is this ? What about other things that are there in Ramayana but absent in Mahabharata ? What is the विनिगमकम् in saying that many other things , not only Rama's horoscope , are a later addithions ?

  

धन्यो’स्मि
