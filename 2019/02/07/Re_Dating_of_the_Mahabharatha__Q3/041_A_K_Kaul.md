Dear Dr. Subrahmanyam Korada,

Jai Shri Ram!

......./2

\<Did you check all 1130 Branches of Veda , if so when and where ?>  

I do not claim to be a Vedic scholar at all! However, I have gone through all the four Vedas viz. the Rig Veda, the Yajurveda (both Shukla and Krishna), the Sama Veda and the Atharva Veda from cover to cover.
Similarly, I did check the Aitreya Brahmana, Taittiriya Brahmana, Shata Patha Brahmana and also Taittiriya Samhita, apart from all the major Upanishadaas from cover to cover.

I can say with all the emphasis at my command that there are no Mesha, Vrisha etc. Rashis in any of these works.

Sun and the Moon have been mentioned times without number in the Vedas but nowhere in the sense in which it is used in predictive astrology!
E.g. the Purusha Sukta of the Rig Veda saysचन्द्रमा मनसो जातः\| चक्षोः सूर्यो अजायत \|  

"The moon was born out of (His)*manas*and the sun from His eyes"  

By no stretch of imagination can it be said that the sun and the moon (known as the two lights instead of planets even in astrology!) have been referred to here in the sense used in predictive astrology since in the very next half of the same mantra we findमुखादिन्द्रश्चाग्निश्च \| प्राणाद्वायुरजायत \|

Same is the case with other such references about the sun and the moon!

The word "Brihaspati" has been used in almost all the Vedas, but as far as I could see, it is never in the sense of the ''astrological" Jupiter! This will be clear from the attachments "Brihaspati-1" from the Rigveda, with Sayana Bhashya. All the three mantras here are referring to Brihaspati but none of these is talking of the astrological Jupiter, but Brihaspati as a god. Also attached are "Brihaspati03" and "Brihaspati04" papers. These are references to mantras that talk of "Brihaspati" in the Krisna Yajurveda! I have checked all these mantras and it can be said without any doubt that none of these mantras have touched the astrological Jupiter even with a long pole!

The attachment "Brihaspati02" is from the "Rigveda-Bhashya-Bhoomika" of Rishi Dayananda Saraswati, the founder of Arya Samaaj! It is a well known fact that he was a very extra-ordinary scholar of the Vedic lore.
Whether or not we agree with some of his views, we can never doubt his integrity!

He has referred to Brihaspati as हे बृहतां वेदानां पते पालक and translated it in Hindi as हे विद्या रक्षक बृहस्पति !

There is a passing reference to "grahas" and "Rahu" in the Atharva Veda 19-9/10, though, but no mention of Rashis, I repeat no mention of Mesha etc. Rashis at all! As per the attachment "AV-grahas", Acharya Sayana has talked of "grahas" as चन्द्रमण्डलस्य भेदकाः संघर्षकाः येअङ्गारकाद्याग्रहाः which can never mean the astrological Mangal and Shani etc. planets. The word "Rahu" has been used for the first and most probably the last time here in any of the Vedas! "Kethu" is conspicuous by its absence, though "dhoomakethu" has been used several times!

In spite of the same, if any learned member, **including you,** of this august forum has been able to find any Mesha, Vrisha etc. Rashis or Mangal , Shani etc. planets in the astrological sense in any of the "1130 branches of Veda", he/she is requested to kindly share that information with other members, since it is just possible that I have "overlooked" those ''astrological" Rashis and planets!  

\<In Vedangas there is no mention of Mesh etc ?

Mangala , Sani etc , names of planets are not there in Veda (available ) ? Are you sure ?\>  

I have already enclosed a copy of "Rik and Yajusha" Jyotisham, which is known as Vedanga Jyotisha. It is a work of 1400 BCE that tells us the methodology of calculating mean tithi, nakshatras of the sun and the moon and solar and lunar seasonal months apart from seasonal Ayanas, Vishuvas and of course solar years!

There are no Mesha etc. Rashis nor Mangal, Shani etc. planets, much less the mathematical points Rahu-Kethu, in either the Rik Jyotisham or the Yajusha Jyotisham!  

Whiletalking of the Vedanga Jyotisham, a masterly commentary in Samskrit and Hindi has been written on the same bya very high caliber scholarShivraj Acharya Kaundinyayanaof Nepal that has beenpublished by Chaukhamba Vidyabhavan, Varanasi in 2005.  

As per the attachment "kanundyayana-2", the Acharyahas declared unequivocally under the heading ''वेदान्गज्योतिषग्रन्थेमेषवृषादिराशीनामुल्लेखस्याभावः " that there are no Mesha, Vrisha etc. rashis in the Vedanga Jyotisha! He has given all the proofs that can be adduced humanly to substantiate his point that not only there is no mention of Mesha etc. Rashis and weekdays in the VJ, but they are absent even from the Mahabharata!

Even if, for the sake of argument, we somehow believe that there were predictive astrologers around at the time of the VJ in 1400 BCE and even the Rashis etc. had "descended" from the heavens, as even a tyro in astronomy knows, mean sun can be plus/minus three degrees/days from the true sun! That means in around 14th century BCE, the only astronomical work that we had, was not able to calculate even the days of Ayanas/Vishuvas properly. As per the attachment "vj-mean-planets" there is a difference of more than one degree/day between the mean longitude (of course, so called sayana!) of the sun as per modern astronomy and the actual timing of ''Uttarayana" in 1400 BCE!

The difference between ''almighty" Lahiri mean longitude and the Winter Solstice is more than 7 degrees/days whereas the difference as per the SS or Aryabhatiya or even Siddhanta Shiromani mean longitudes and the timing of Winter Solstice is more than 28 degrees/days! That means if the timings of the Solstices or equinoxes were calculated as per the siddhantas then, it could have been plus/minus 28 days from the actual phenomena!

So how "predictive astrologers" of that era could have calculated horoscopes, that too with *shashthyamsha* of planets and (non-existent) Rashis accurately, is a moot point!

After Rik and Yajusha Jyotisha, there is a work known as ''Atma-Jyotisha" which is also known as Atharvana-Jyotisham!

It claims to have been "revealed" by none other than Brahmaji Himself, but the one and only Pandit Shankar Balakrishna Dikshit has proved it to be a work of about fifth/sixth century BCE. Though it talks of weekdays and planets and Karna etc., but even this work does not talk of Mesha etc. Rashis!

That proves it conclusively that even around fifth/sixth century BCE, Mesha etc. Rashis were not ''available" in India!

Rest of the points in my next mail!

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!

Avtar Krishen Kaul
