Namaste



1. On \< I might sound like a complaining person \> . Not at all.



2. Your question \< My quest is to locate any text that might talk about astronomical phenomena connected with the \< Yuga-Kshaya>. \>
represents a perspective of looking at the text and seeking an answer.



 'yuga-anta' is another connected expression that one may start looking for in this exploration. The term ' yuganta' is connected with several contexts in the narratives. some describe the event as ' Brilliant sun light'; some as dissolution of earth with floods of cosmic waters. To filter out from all these usages, what could be the \< astronomical phenomena> that may satisfy your quest, is something that needs further study.



 *Additional note*: Similarly ' Yuga-Aadi= beginning of the Yuga becomes elusive when the meaning of yuga is not clear. Yet, with all this , we do have an annual celebration of YUGADI ( solar and Lunar, the panchanga publications and all related programs).



3. There are 27 occurrences and connected explanation of \< yuganta> in the Mahabharata text, as available at the url:
<http://bombay.indology.info/mahabharata/text/ASCII/MBh03.txt>



 Your question carries a premise of Sky phenomenon and Earth-phenomenon connected with the expression \< yuga-kshaya>. In all
cases, the term 'Yuga' does not stay consistent with the ' TIME MEASURE' associated with it - be it the five thousand year scale or several thousand years scale.



 Your expression \< astronomical phenomenon> is understood as something that happens in the Sky, as observed from Earth. The Mbh text speaks many social changes also.





4. The problem continues to remain a vexed one.



 We are not the only one who are perplexed by this question on ' Yuga'- Yugaanta'- Yuga-kshaya' and 'Yugaadi'.



 If any one was more sure and clear on this issue, it was the earlier writers on Dharmashastra and Vedanga jyotisha. How we lost the clarity on these terms and ending in this discussion scenario is something deeply connected with the way we are studying our traditional texts, the language of the text, namely :SAMSKRUTHAM.



 The academicians call this as problems in ' Sanskrit Language Pedagogy'. Computational Sanskrit Linguists call this a challenge of ' Sanskrit Language Modeling'. Colonials and Orientalists call this as ' Natural decays and meaning shifts in Historical Sanskrit language usage.



 Lexicons offer little help to resolve this issue ! Try to figure out the ' listing of the term 'yuga' in all the dictionaries listed at
<https://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/> .
