Respected Dr. B V K Sastry,

Jai Shri Ram!

\<I appreciate and agree with your observation \< Yes, we must do a serious research .... But in spite of all such integrity ...if we are still groping in the dark, we must certainly do a lot of introspection as to why it is happening like that!... Could it be that we are carrying some "baggage" ---having some psychological constrictions/constraints... I see no reason of have these double standards of paying just lip service to the Siddhantas but going by the**''Anya-deshi" software and algorithms**? \> The field is open . Let all of us explore.>

The field has already been explored!

\< If the BVP team, with all the resources at their command and faith-force can establish \< Krita-Yuga-- at least about 1,200,000 years before the Incarnation of Bhagwan Ram> the World History, the ancientness of Vedas and Date of Buddha would certainly need to be re-written and taught afresh.>

There is a software prepared by Shri Vinay Jha. It is known as
"Kundalee" and is based entirely on the Surya Siddhanta! It covers a very long range of years right from at least a hundred of thousand years back to a hundred thousand years in future! Anybody can download it for free from [Vedicastrology.wikidot.com](http://Vedicastrology.wikidot.com) and try it for himself/herself!

But then how useful it is/will be for calculating the horoscopes of Bhagwan Ram or Krishna etc. can be anybody's guess! Above all, Shri Jha has said it himself that the Surya Siddhanta planetary longitudes are/were meant only for preparing horoscopes and nothing else. But the Surya Siddhanta itself has not imposed any such restrictions since it has given the methodology of calculating eclipses etc.

For ready reference, I am attaching the chart of Bhagwan Krishna for 00 hours of July 20, 3228 BC for Mathura, as advocated by late Dr. B V Raman in his "Notable Horoscopes", as per "Kundalee" software and also JHora by P V R Narasimha Rao! The latter software is also free and anybody can download the same!

You will find that there is a difference of heaven and earth between the two so much so that the chart from J Hora does not tally even with the details given by Dr. Raman himself in his book---in spite of using the same Ayanamsha! But then Dr. Raman had "correlated" the events of Bhagwan Krishna meticulously with His horoscope!

You can draw your own conclusions as to how far we can rely on astrological charts whether from the SS or from modern astronomy or not-so-modern-astronomy!

\<Academic Scholars are still bargaining for the antiquity of ' Vedas'
between 1800 BCE to 10,000 BCE; and may be at best 60,000 years !!

For Buddha , the range is still 700 BCE to 1500 BCE; Less spoken about Acharya Shankara , better it is in this context !! And Jains have the Teerthankaras time list that may be close to the kind of years -time cycle you have indicated.>

The Vedas, judging from the astronomical data/details there, cannot be claimed to be older than 10000 BCE in any case. Besides, conditions of the human race even about 10000 BC were not favourable/conducive for lofty and pithy eternal truths enshrined in the Vedic lore!

Similarly, the dates of Bhagwan Buddha around 600 BCE and Aadi Shankara around 800 AD have been worked out meticulously and with great labour by selfless scholars. Those findings cannot be brushed aside just because we have some "scholars" claiming Gautama the Buddha to have been around in 1800 BCE and Aadi Shankara in 600 BCE on very slim proofs like "Dotted Records" or "janmapatris" which cannot stand the test of time especially since nobody knows as to how and when those "dots" were inserted and by whom! Dr. B V Raman had prepared a horoscope of Gautama the Buddha for 623 BCE in his "Notable Horoscopes"!!

\< Please revisit the basics of these TIME DIVISION concepts from the original texts, the meaning of ' Tri-Skandha' organization, the ongoing practices and contemplate on the 'Yoga meaning of Samskruth terms used in the originals. Please raise above the literal translations and preferred meanings to align the text with preferential practice seen now. \>

The attachment "Mahayuga" is a meticulously worked out document giving a detailed analysis of the yugas and kalpas and the age of Brahmajias per the Surya Siddhanta!

The same dimensions of yugas in the Puranas and the other siddhantas could be later additions since we do not find any reference to such long time-spans in any earlier astronomical works anywhere in the world! It is also just not possible that the great demon Maya, (supposed to be the father-in-law of Ravana who had abducted Mother Sita!) was really existing around a couple of million years back and was gracious enough to have "revealed" the orbital elements of planets for a who kalpa i.e. 4,320,000 multiplied by 1000 =4,320,000,000 i.e four thousand three hundred twenty million---a whopping number of years----without any secular variations!

On the face of it, since the homo sapiens have been around only over the last about couple of hundred thousand years, anybody having even a basic knowledge of astronomy----or even some common sense!--- can see it for himself that the SS is a concoction of the worst order "invented" by someone for making a fool of the gullible public of Bharatavarsha!

\<The term 'yuga' will not be clear if the term 'varsha' translated as ' human year' ( 36- to 365 depending upon what one prefers ! so does the related term kalpa used in Gita \< kalpakShaye punastAni kalpAdau visR^ijAmyaham .. 9\\-7.. \>\>  

The term Varsha is being translated as human years since that is what the Surya Siddhanta and other Siddhantas have advised us to do! But ironically, the same Surya Siddhanta gives the duration of a solar year as 360 days instead of about 365.25, the duration of a seasonal year that it is advocating!

\< The term ' varsha' comes from prevalent texts of Ramayana , attributed to Valmiki original narrative, mentioning the ruling period of Dasharatha. If one has to go by this, the land based history needs to be written on the Astronomical scale. It does endorse faith and greatness of the ' Avatars' as ' Concern of Divine for human welfare, descending in the form of Avataras'. But the hardnosed evidence seeking archeologists, indologists, IE linguists andIE linguists
and theological religion constructionists ( = Colonial scholars and many oriental scholars going by their views) do not accept it.>

As clarified already several times, I was literally shocked to learn that there was no mention of Mangal, Shani etc. planets, much less the dreaded Kalasarpa-Yoga "planets" Rahu-Kethu in the Vedas.  

Similarly, Mesha, Vrisha etc. Rashis are conspicuous by their absence from the Vedas and the Vedangas!At least, I have not come across any such "planets" or "Rashis" in the Vedas and since this august forum consists of eminent scholars most of whom must have gone through the entire Vedic lore, I would request them to tell this forum if they have come across any Mangal, Shani etc. planets or Mesha, Vrisha etc. Rashis in the Vedas!

It means that the real Vamadevas and Vishwamitras were practicing some kind of "predictive astrology"----if at all they practiced it---sans the Rashis and planets! Thus IMHO by ascribing the fad of peeping into future to the Vedic seers, that also on the shoulders of inanimate planets and imaginary twelve divisions of the ecliptic known as Rashis,
we are just under-estimating their real knowledge though we call them *sarvajnyas* at the same time and in the same breath!!

Regarding the "ruling period" of Dasharatha, it is a moot point as to how we find the mention of Rashis and "Gochara" in the Valmiki Ramayana when they are absent from a much later work viz. the Mahabharata! Could they be a later day addition in the Valmiki Ramayana?

\<so you suggest that Aryabhatta was at fault and acted as a manipulator-misleader of the tradition ??!!

You think that the later writers on Vedanga Jyotisha were dumb fellows to over look such manipulations if it existed ??\>

The Surya Siddhanta, since it pretended to have been "talking" in the fag end of the last Krita Yga, has said in 1/57-58 that the mean longitudes of all the planets except for the lunar nodes and apsides started from Zero degrees of Mesha Rashi at the end of the last Krita Yuga. The SS has however, "arranged" the planetary calculations in such a manner that after every 1080000 years, they converge at zero degrees, with the result that the mean longitudes of planets as per the SS are zero for the midnight of February 17/18, 3102 BCE---that too for Ujjain and that too for Ujaain Mean Time!

Aryabhata had used the same longitudes in his initial work "Aryabhata Siddhanta" and started Kaliyuga from February 17/18 midnight, like that of the SS, but later changed his mind to make it start from 6-00 am on February 18, 3102 BCE!

Varahamaiira had in his Pancha-Siddhantika XV/20 castigated Aryabhata for saying at one place that Kaliyuga started at midnight but at another place that it started at sunrise!

\< Coming to Nakshatras -Moon ( Nakshatra bhoga Kaala by Chandra)
clarity for Dashaa - bhukti reckoning , the Jyotish teams have divided views! When these terms and axioms were placed in to the texts, the authors seems to be extremely clear on what they were talking and method of using them for calculation. But today ( in the last 300 years at least; certainly after the mechanical and quartz clocks; the shift to Gregorian calendar; the fifty plus Panchangas floating around Bharath) it is difficult to establish what might have been the true meaning of the term and shifts in its meaning. Surprising enough, with all this confusion, the practice of Parashari Vednaga Jyotisha still gives reasonably good predictions and accurate timing to the window of one day for events. How it happens - is still a mystery. Experience shows it works. Reasoning is not able to comprehend the logic of this.>

Astronomy is entirely different from astrology! The former is a branch of science whereas the latter a speculation! The earliest Rashi-based astrological work available in India today is "Sphujidwaja's Yavana Jatakam" of about second century AD. On the other hand, the earliest available printed edition of Brhat Parashari from Venkateshwar Steam Press, Mumbai, has advised to use Grahalaghava Ayanasha. And as is common knowledge, Grahalaghava is a work of sixteenth century by Ganesha Daivagya!

That means the BPHS that I have with me is a post 16th century work, though it claims to be of the fag end of Dwapara Yuga and by Maharshi Parashara himself!

What is all the more surprising is that Maharshi Parashara has not said anywhere in his Vishnu Purana or any other work that he has prepared a treatise on predictive astrology! Nor has his son the Veda Vyasa or any other Rishi in any of the Puranas or any other wok referred to any Brihat Parashari by Maharshi Parashara!

Bhatotpala, in eighth century AD, had lamented that though he had heard about Parashari but he had not been able to locate a copy of the same.
You can draw your own conclusions!

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!

Avtar Krishen Kaul
