Avtar,  
Before we proceed on other points let us clarify nakshatras.  
Please contest whichever point you might want to but with evidence:  
a) RgVed knew 27 Nakshatras  
b) Moon spent a single night in every nakshatr. This means 360 degrees were traversed in 27+ nights.  
Hence each nakshatra was 360/27 degrees.  
  
Unless you are arguing that moon sometimes spent two nights or three nights in a single nakshatra?  
  
Please clarify.  
  
Shivraj
