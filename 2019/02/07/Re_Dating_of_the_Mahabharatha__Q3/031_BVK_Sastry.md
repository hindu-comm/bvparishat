Namaste



On \< Yuga-Kshaya> ...\< astronomical speculations> .. the works dealing with ' Vedanga Jyotisha- Astronomical observation and calculation deals with this. Valmiki's usage is literary (kavya). Dharma shastra usage is cosmology- model. Vedanga Jyotisha usage is predefined -contextual meaning for the term ' Yuga'.



1. Vedanga Jyotisha adapts the ' Yuga' Time measure understanding, which yields huge numbers. Vedanga jyotisha is not having any deviation from the \<yuga> concept prevalent other wise.



2. The term ' yuga' has to be contextually interpreted for the duration of the length it is supposed to point. The meaning of 'Yuga' in Dharma Shastra' cannot be ported blindly to 'Vedanga Jyotisha'. Please see the details in the attached book, by Mohan, Chander. (2015). THE STORY OF ASTRONOMY IN INDIA. The book is available online at the link:
<https://www.researchgate.net/publication/288838271_THE_STORY_OF_ASTRONOMY_IN_INDIA> .

The work has specific sections addressing your question from Astronomical and Dharma Shastra perspective. 



***The extract from 4.1 reads***: 

4.1 Five Year Yuga

A Yuga in Vedang Jyotish has 5 years, 1830 days and 62 lunar months. This results in (1830/5) i.e. 366 days in an year and the number of solar days in a lunar month to be 1830/62 i.e. 29.516 days. (Had the length of a Yuga been taken to be 1831 days, then the number of days in a lunar month would have been a bit more accurate. However the number of days in a solar year would have been 366.2. This would have been much farther from the correct value).

**It is apparent that the length of Yuga chosen was too small.** (It is just one year more than the present day leap year period of four which too has some error which is rectified when a century is considered a leap year only if it is divisible by 400 and not four thus reducing the number of leap years in a four hundred year period by 3). Of course the length of 29.516 solar days in a lunar month is a bit better estimate than 29 and a half solar days. However still it has some error. For example after a 20 year period, one would notice that when according to calculations it should be new moon in reality it would be a crescent (a

difference of around three and a half days!). Such a result would have indicated that there was some basic mistake in the assumed length of Yuga. Later period books on Indian astronomy in fact assume a very large length of a Yuga. For example in Aryabhattiya (which was written in fifth century A.D.), a Yuga is taken to be of 43,20,000 solar years duration!



3. ***It is a mute question for research*** : Did Vedanga Jyotisha works carry multiple meanings of the term ' Yuga' ? simultaneously ? OR contextually for different calculations?

It seems to be so, if one goes through the work ' Karna- Kuthoohala' by one author Bhashara ( 1150 - 1200 C.E.) under the technicality of ' Tantra ( Technicality of term) ' ( Not the Tantra as in the context of Mantra, discipline etc;.) 

See the research paper available from link : <http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/47605/7/07_chapter%201.pdf>
( File attached).



4. On the specific point on \< yuga-kshaya>, the Vedanga Jyotisha works speak of \< tithi-kshaya / vruddhi \> . As this is related to TIME-MEASURE concepts, the concept of yuga-kshaya might have surfaced as a logical extension of thought.
