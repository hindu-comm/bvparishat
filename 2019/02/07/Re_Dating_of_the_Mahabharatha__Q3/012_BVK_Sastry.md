Namaste



**1. Bijoy Misra ji -** On \< In this context, is there a description of **युगक्षय **somewhere? Reference? > : 



 The expression ' Yugakshaye' is found in Vishnusahasranama preamble related text. It reads: 

yasmiM shcha pralayaM yaanti punareva **yugakshaye** \|\| (16) tasya lokapradhaanasya jagannaathasya bhuupate \| vishhNornaamasahasraM me shRuNu paapabhayaapaham \|\| (17).



 The context is explaining the cosmology time scale in relation to Mahavishnu and importance of chanting Vishnu sahasranaama. The Vishnu sahasra naama is linked to Bhishma of Mahabharata.



 The term meaning 'yuga' is flexibly interpreted, mainly in tune with the Dharma Shaastra understanding; leading to the huge number of human years scaled up to construct the ' day- Night / life frame of Four faced Brahma'.



**2. Avatar Krishen Kaul** : I appreciate and agree with your observation \< Yes, we must do a serious research .... But in spite of all such integrity ...if we are still groping in the dark, we must certainly do a lot of introspection as to why it is happening like that!... Could it be that we are carrying some "baggage" ---having some psychological constrictions/constraints... I see no reason of have these double standards of paying just lip service to the Siddhantas but going by the **''Anya-deshi" software and algorithms**? \> The field is open . Let all of us explore.



 If the BVP team, with all the resources at their command and faith-force can establish \< Krita-Yuga-- at least about 1,200,000 years before the Incarnation of Bhagwan Ram> the World History, the ancientness of Vedas and Date of Buddha would certainly need to be re-written and taught afresh. Academic Scholars are still bargaining for the antiquity of ' Vedas' between 1800 BCE to 10,000 BCE; and may be at best 60,000 years !! For Buddha , the range is still 700 BCE to 1500 BCE; Less spoken about Acharya Shankara , better it is in this context !! And Jains have the Teerthankaras time list that may be close to the kind of years -time cycle you have indicated.









**3. **On \< Vedanga Jyotisha is talking of nothing but a five year yuga comprising Samvatsara, Parivatsara, Idavatsara, Anuvasara and Idvatsara. It does not talk of any planets, much less their longitudes and positions, but gives simply the fundamental arguments for working out mean longitudes of the sun and the moon so that proper "muhurtas" like tithi, nakshra, ritu, masa, paksha etc. for yajnyas could be determined. \>



 Please revisit the basics of these TIME DIVISION concepts from the original texts, the meaning of ' Tri-Skandha' organization, the ongoing practices and contemplate on the 'Yoga meaning of Samskruth terms used in the originals. Please raise above the literal translations and preferred meanings to align the text with preferential practice seen now. 



 The term 'yuga' will not be clear if the term 'varsha' translated as ' human year' ( 36- to 365 depending upon what one prefers ! so does the related term kalpa used in Gita \< kalpakShaye punastAni kalpAdau visR^ijAmyaham .. 9\\-7.. \>



 The term ' varsha' comes from prevalent texts of Ramayana , attributed to Valmiki original narrative, mentioning the ruling period of Dasharatha. If one has to go by this, the land based history needs to be written on the Astronomical scale. It does endorse faith and greatness of the ' Avatars' as ' Concern of Divine for human welfare, descending in the form of Avataras'. But the hardnosed evidence seeking archeologists, indologists, IE linguists and theological religion constructionists ( = Colonial scholars and many oriental scholars going by their views) do not accept it.



 If one thinks Amarakosha, the celebrated lexicon will clarify this, it does not take any further on this issue.



 If one takes the ' Vedanga Jyotisha', the amount of confusion that is prevalent has already been noted.

If Vedanga Jyotihsa people desire that ' (Divya) Yuga' calculations
need to be scaled down to ' human scale' and lock the TIME DIVINE concept ( Kaala / Mahaa-Kaala) - from Gita and other texts, using ' ahargana' calculations, the ayanmsha working is going to bail them out, they are in to much deeper soup. Why? The mechanical model of TIME measured in the Solar system by planetary objects going round the Sun-Star totally violates the ' Graha-Devataa' concept, so fundamental to Vedanga Jyotisha ! 



 Positioning that Surya Siddhanta is superior to other systems will not resolve this issue. Irrespective of the numeric calculation models out of the eighteen siddhantas, and their subtle differences ( and Ego positions locked to the claims on accuracy of the calculations) , connecting the ' Muhurta accuracy calculation and the ' phala-soochanaa' using the primary axiom of ' TIME DIVINE influencing the Human activity ( unfolding of Punya / Karma phala/ Dharma / graha-chara) is still falling in the ' yet to be proved zone of science'.



 Coming to Nakshatras -Moon ( Nakshatra bhoga Kaala by Chandra)
clarity for Dashaa - bhukti reckoning , the Jyotish teams have divided views! When these terms and axioms were placed in to the texts, the authors seems to be extremely clear on what they were talking and method of using them for calculation. But today ( in the last 300 years at least; certainly after the mechanical and quartz clocks; the shift to Gregorian calendar; the fifty plus Panchangas floating around Bharath) it is difficult to establish what might have been the true meaning of the term and shifts in its meaning. Surprising enough, with all this confusion, the practice of Parashari Vednaga Jyotisha still gives reasonably good predictions and accurate timing to the window of one day for events. How it happens - is still a mystery. Experience shows it works. Reasoning is not able to comprehend the logic of this.



**4. **. Did any of the Vedanga Jyotisha works use the yuga concept- time scale to fix up the ' land anchor date of Kurushetra war, Date of birth of Sri Rama and Krishna, the day when Sri Hayagreeva made his avataara to uplift the ' pruthvi' - ? It does not seem to be there.
The Dharmashaastra kaaras seem to have mirrored the large time scale to a cyclic lunar / solar/ stellar/ Jovan year to mark certain time segments as ' auspicious'. It is in this context we see ' Jyotisha' as ' Hora - shaastra' associating the ' Graha devataas' as ' Hour- deities' creates the ' Vaara-Chakra' ( Seven day week cycle of sunday to sunday) . Given this scenario, the Monday time of 7.30 to 9.00 does not make any difference for the clock in the morning or night; but the vedanga Jyotisha marks one segment as ' Time of Rahu/ inauspicious'.
Why ? Not explained. 



**5. **. On \< On the other hand, Aryabhata has taken the orbital elements from the old Surya Siddhanta of Pancha-Siddhantika and **"manipulated" them in a manner to work out a "Chaturyuga" of his choice **since according to him, every yuga has a duration of 4,320,000 divided by 4 = 1,080,000 years instead of the ratio 1:2:3:4! \>



 so you suggest that Aryabhatta was at fault and acted as a manipulator-misleader of the tradition ??!!

You think that the later writers on Vedanga Jyotisha were dumb fellows to over look such manipulations if it existed ??



**6. **. On \< इत्थं युग सहस्रेण भूतसंहारकारकः \| कल्पो ब्राह्ममहः
प्रोक्तं शर्वरी तस्य तावती \|\|

"Thus a thousand of the great yugas make a KALPA, a period which destroys the whole world. It is a day of the God Brahma, and his night is equal to his day"\| Bapu Dev Sastri translation. >



Another term that is a mess, because ' Yuga' meaning is messed up. What is the logic for Bapu deva Sastri's translation of gita ??



How on earth did the term \< Samkalpa> which means ' Declaration at the beginning of the 'karma' get connected to the time scale ' kalpa'? Word similarity ? Then why not to Vedanga ' Kalpa' ??



There needs to be some rationale in the practice of tradition.



And just for records sake, please let us know : what is the first known occurrence of the current popular \<samkalpa>, reading ' Shubhe shobhane muhurte, adya-brahmanah dviteeya parardhe .. jamboodweepe,
bharatavarshe, bharatakhande, ... shaalivahana shake, bauddhavataare
... ramakshetra , **asmin vartamaane** **vyaavaharike** ..... \>
Could this be as old as ' Ramayana' itself ? Or some Gruhya sutra gives this framework ??



**7. **. On \< about 22 lakhs of years back! ... What is all the more surprising is that it has survived in its "pristine" form for such a long duration of time! ...Till about a few decades back my grandfather, my father and even I myself in my childhood days believed every word of this ''Arsha work"! But with the passage of time, I started feeling quite uneasy as to how I was being taken for a ride by the manipulation that the Surya Siddhanta that I am/was "reciting" is a work of 22 lakhs of years back>



Finding an answer to this question is what Yoga way learning- using Samskrutham will provide ! Through the 'Jyotir-Yoga ( = Vedanga Jyotisha) one will realize the meaning of the BG Statement\< Kalosmi> and then the 'finite divisions and processes that occur in TIME-SPACE;
the scaled relative measure of which is 'aho-raatra'- the cyclic manifestation and involution of Consciousness.





Sorry for a stright talk. Sorry if the truth of ' kings clothes' hurts any ones sentiments. As a devout religious person, when i recite the Samkalpa, i am not looking at the land history; and it does not mean anything for the ' samskara' - poojaa- vrata' perfomance with 'Shraddhaa' .
