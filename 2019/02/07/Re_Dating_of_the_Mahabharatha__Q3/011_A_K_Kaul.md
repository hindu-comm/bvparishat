Dear Shri Bijoy Mishraji,

Jai Shri Ram!

I do not remember having come across any statement like युगक्षय in any of the siddhantas or Purana etc.  
May be I have overlooked it but astronomically, whether siddhantic or modern, such a phenomenon is impossible.

Thus if at all such a statement has occurred anywhere it must be in a figurative sense!

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!

Avtar Krishan Kaul

PS

Btw, I do not have a doctorate in any discipline. As such, pl. just address me without any such appellations!
