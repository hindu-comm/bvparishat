Namaste

I would like to share the revised/improved content of first phase of
Yoga-vaiśāradī – the searchable web repository of Classical Yoga texts.

**The Link - Yoga-vaiśāradī - <https://kymyogavaisharadi.org/>**

The following classical Commentaries to Yogasūtra can now be read and searched in Yoga-vaiśāradī

Vyāsa-bhāṣya to Yogasūtra - All available sub-commentaries to Vyāsa-bhāṣya that include,  

 1. Tattvavaiśāradī of Vācaspati Miśra (9th or 10th CE)

2.  Vivaraṇa of Śaṅkara (13th Century – not settled with finality) 3.  Vārttika of Vijñānabhikṣu (15th Century) 4.  Bhāsvatī of Hariharānanda Āraṇya (19th century) 5.  Pātañjalarahasyam rāghavānanda (15^(th) Century) – a sub-commentary
    to Tattvavaiśāradī of Vācaspati Miśra

Apart from this - Tamil translation of Vyāsa’s commentary to Yogasutras
by Dr.M.Jayaraman with copious footnotes from the sub-commentaries can also be read and searched.

**Other Classical Yoga texts that can be read and searched **

1. Haṭhayogapradīpikā of Svātmārāma with Jyotsnā commentary of Brahmānanda

2. Bhagavadītā (mūlamātram)

**Search Feature**

The classical texts digitized in this website can be search both in devanagari and IAST scripts. Some interesting ways of searches include -  

****

1. **The principal Yoga texts** Yogasūtra, Haṭhayogapradīpikā and bhagavadītā can be search together or in any desired combination.

**2. All the commentaries** of the classical texts can be searched together or in any desired combination****

**3. All sub-commentaries **can be searched together or in any desired combination****

**Other User-friendly features **

**1. Scripts -** All the classical Sanskrit texts can be read in five scripts – **Devanagari, IAST (Roman Transliteration), Bengali, Kannada and Tamil.**

**2. Audio book of **Vyāsa’s commentary has been added to facilitate better access to the Sanskrit text and also towards facilitating the access of classical Sanskrit texts to Visually challenged Divyanga users. ****

The second phase of the work is on-going and more texts and features facilitating accessibility to the texts are planned to be included.

I welcome suggestions, from the esteemed members of this group, on **Yoga-vaiśāradī - <https://kymyogavaisharadi.org/>**. Testimonials are also welcome. I also request the members to kindly share the details about this tool with their students and research scholars.
