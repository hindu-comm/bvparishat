On the day three of the BVP conference at Udupi , a session with the theme " Whose Sanskrit is it anyway? " was organised. It was an all women session. A few women Sanskrit scholars spoke autobiographically about their own personal journey into and through this field.

  

They highlighted how it is more women than men most Sanskrit universities and departments.

  

They spoke about the encouragement they received from the teachers, family members and society.
