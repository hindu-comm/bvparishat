Namaste  

  

Thanks for posting the link. It was thrilling to watch the narration of our sisters on the encouragement that they received for studying Samskrtam.  

These factual narrations were honey to the ears, which were thoroughly injured and irritated by the hate driven and biased "Asmat Samskritam" of Ananya Vajpayee and the likes in the World Sanskrit Conference.

Commendations to the organizers who thought of this and put together this panel.  

  

  

regards

Jayaraman
