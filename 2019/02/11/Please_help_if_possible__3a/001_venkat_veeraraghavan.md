Vandanaji:

  

I expect the conversion brigade got the idea from "paramahansa" Yogananda whose ghost written book Autobiography of a Yogi talks about "Christ" consciousness etc. and opines that Christ has "fixed" the model of evolution for this epoch along with "Krishna" and "Babaji".

  

It is really unfortunate that one Bengali young man's desire to make Yoga acceptable to the Xian west and make it big in USA should be made into a weapon of conversion.  
  
Incidentally one of the Tamil siddhas was a Christian (Yakobu / Jacob) atleast by birth. As for the rest the Tamizh siddha's teachings have as much in common with Christianity as cheese does with chalk.
