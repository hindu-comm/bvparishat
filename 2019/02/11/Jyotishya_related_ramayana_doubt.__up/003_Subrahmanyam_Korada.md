नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

\> What is the relation between ANGARAKA GRAHA and ROHINI nakshatram.

 In RAMAYANA valmiki used this to describe the sita who is in ashoka vana of ravanna.  
     1. I dont know about the astrological relation of the angaraka and the rohini.  
2. Why angaraka is a krura graha for rohini.  
3. What about the other grhas i feel every graha is not a krura graha . So please tell me the others too.\<

  

                             ---- Vid Siva Prasad

  

The seventh house in the horoscope (जातकचक्रम् / जन्मकुण्डली) is called जामित्रम् and it tells about the wife / husband ( their conjugal
relation - दांपत्यम् ) ।

  

When you are checking the योग्यता / compatibility of bride and groom then you should check whether .there

is कुजदोष ( native is माङ्गलिक) --

  

if कुज is there in 2/4/7/8/12 house from लग्नम् / चन्द्र / शुक्र - then he / she has got कुजदोष --

  

**धने व्यये च पाताळे जामित्रे चाष्टमे कुजः ।**

**स्त्रीणां भर्तृविनाशाय पुंसां भार्याविनाशकम् ॥**

  

But in most of the cases the कुजदोष is nullified --

  

**स्वोच्चमित्रभजातानां पीडको न भवेत् कुजः -- देवकेरळम्**

  

कुज will not hurt those who are born in his own houses - मेष and वृश्चिक , उच्चक्षेत्रम् - मकर and  

मित्रक्षेत्राणि -- सिंह , धनुष् , मीन ( houses of रवि and गुरु ) .

  

Any connection ( three kinds of संबन्ध ) - कुज is associated with गुरु in a single house , or कुज is swapped

( परिवर्तनम् ) or कुज is aspected ( गुरुदृष्टिः ) by गुरु thru any one of 7th, 5fth or 9th .

  

Also if both , the bride and groom , have got then also the कुजदोष is nullified .

  

Come to the present question --

  

if रोहिणी is the नक्षत्रम् , the राशि will be वृषभ -- ’ कृत्तिकात्रयः रोहिणिमृगशिरार्धं वृषभः ’ । शुक्र is the अधिपति ।

  

Then जामित्रम् ( seventh house ) will be वृश्चिक - its अधिपति being कुज ।

  

So there will be disturbance in married life .

  

कुज , शनि , रवि , क्षीणचन्द्र , राहु and केतु -- are पापग्रहs .

  

**Bonus Info** --

  

while teaching रामायणम् - one has to answer a question -- why सीता was in लंका ?

  

वाल्मीकि indirectly provides the answer -- राम was born in कर्कटकलग्नम्
।

  

Experienced ज्यौतिषिकs say -- there will be any one of the three results for one who is born in कर्कटकलग्नम् -

  

वियोगः ( श्रीरामः ) / मरणम् ( Tyagaraja and a Prime Minister of India lost their wives and another Prime

Minister lost her husband ) / दीर्घरोगिता ।

  

Samkaracarya's horoscope is different - he got संन्यास ।

  

Ramayanam was authored in त्रेतायुग -- there were seven planets only .

  

राशिs were there since time immemorial - one cannot say that राशिs are not there in वेद - did he check

all the 1130 शाखs of वेद ( with योगिप्रत्यक्षम् ) ?

  

धन्यो’स्मि
