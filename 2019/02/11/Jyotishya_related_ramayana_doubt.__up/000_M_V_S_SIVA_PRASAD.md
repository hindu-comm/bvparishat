Respected scholars  
What is the relation between ANGARAKA GRAHA and ROHINI nakshatram.  
In RAMAYANA valmiki used this to describe the sita who is in ashoka vana of ravanna.  
1. I dont know about the astrological relation of the angaraka and the rohini.  
2. Why angaraka is a krura graha for rohini.  
3. What about the other grhas i feel every graha is not a krura graha . So please tell me the others too.  
  
Thank you
