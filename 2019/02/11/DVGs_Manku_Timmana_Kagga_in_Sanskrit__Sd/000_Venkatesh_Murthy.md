Namaste

  

I want to know if some scholar has or is planning to undertake to translate into Sanskrit poems the great masterpiece of DVG known as Manku Timmana Kagga. It is also known as the Kannada Bhagavad Gita. It is full of philosophical poems of DVG.

  

Sometime back I found Vemana Padyas translated into Sanskrit by Sri Desikan Siromani.

Similarly has some scholar translated Sarvajna's Vachanas into Sanskrit?

  

Why should we have Sanskrit translation of masterpieces in local languages? Because it is like dressing up the masterpiece bride in royal clothes and offering her in marriage to Parameshvara like Parvati was offered in marriage.
