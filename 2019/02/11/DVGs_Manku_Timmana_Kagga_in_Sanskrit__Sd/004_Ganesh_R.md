Dear Sir,

  

Mankutimmana Kagga was translated in parts (in Anushtubh meter) by a renowned scholar, Sri. Kadava Shambhusharma hailing from Puttur. Also, a few verses were translated by the esteemed grammarian N. Ranganatha Sharma (in Viyogini meter). Both these are published.  

  

A scholar by name Bommalapura Venkatarama Bhatta had translated almost 90% of Mankutimmana Kagga. This was a very well-done translation (in Vasantatilaka meter). But it is unfortunate that this is not published. I had seen the carbon-copy manuscript before two decades; I do not know the current whereabouts of the same.  

  

These authors, however, are no more.  

  

Best regards,

R. Ganesh
