Namaste dear scholars

  

Mahashivaratri is nearing. We have many Shivaratri in a year and Mahashivaratri too.

  

What could be the jyothishastra interpretation to Mahashivaratri.

  

Because this is one of the most important penance that we follow, can we find its roots in Holy Vedas?

  

Neelkant and Neelagreeva can be a reference. Is there anything more you can find?

  

Is there any studies in this regard?

  

Sincerely

Arun Prabhakar
