The oldest copy of Mendeleev's Periodic Table found.

(English Translation of the news in Russian)

In Scotland, found the oldest copy of the periodic table, printed in 1885. The table was found by chance during the cleaning of the university laboratory, which was not analyzed for almost 55 years.  
\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*  
We found a lot of lost objects, old educational literature, as well as rolled-up lecture materials, inside which the old periodic system of chemical elements hid,  
- said Dr. Alan Aitken from Scottish University of St. Andrews.  
\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*  
The researchers said that Dmitry Mendeleev published the first scheme of the table in 1869. In the first diagram, 63 elements were arranged in 19 rows and six columns.

A year later, the table was edited and the rows were converted into eight vertically arranged groups, and the columns turned into periods.

It was possible to date the found document on the basis of the elements represented in it: gallium and scandium, discovered in 1875 and 1879, are in the table, but there is no germanium discovered in 1886.  
\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*  
In the lower corner there is a stamp “Verlag v. Lenoir & Forster, Wien ”: at the end of the 19th century, this Vienna printing house specialized in the printing of scientific literature. He left his “autograph” and lithographer: “Lith. von Ant. Hartinger & Sohn, Wien ",  
- Experts explained.  
\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

To clarify the data, scientists turned to the university archive. It turned out that in October 1888, Professor of Chemistry Thomas Pardy purchased the “Periodic table printed in 1885 from the catalog of the German company C. Gerhardt” The purchase price was three gold marks.

It is not surprising that taking the post of professor, the scientist followed the latest recent advances in his field.

According to the latest data, the table found is the oldest in Europe, and possibly in the world.
