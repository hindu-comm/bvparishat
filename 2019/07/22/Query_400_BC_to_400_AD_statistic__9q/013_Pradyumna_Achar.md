Respected Sri Megh,

  

\>\>.. if anyone has any good reason (or reasons) to assert that the Mahābhāratawas composed between 400 BC and 400 AD and that such an assertionisneither "completely false" nor "pure conjecture", could s/he share her/his reason or reasons for the same or share a reference that can help address the query reasonably unambiguously.

  

I reject this assertion, but I found a reference for the argument in Wikipedia -><https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk%3AMahabharata%2FArchive_2> (in the section "Origin and compilation date for the epic")

  

Regards

Pradyumna
