नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

The Mahabharata is not written in perfect Paninian Sanskrit, it is in a vernacular dialect of Sanskrit which was spoken in that period (400 BCE to 0 CE).

                                 ------ Vid Ramakrishnan

  

I am curious --

  

did you study Mahabharata and Panini ?

  

did Panini touch any usages from Mahabharata ?

  

what is vernacular ? - according to you - what is dialect ? -- what is vernacular dialect ? especially of Sanskrit ? Any examples in Morphology / Syntax ?

  

Or are you just following the translated versions of the epic and the views of some म्लेच्छ-s !

  

Not about you -- still there are some 'scholars' who are clinging to the notions born in the West - and have been suffering from inferiority complex - may be the लग्नाधिपति in their horoscopes is in नीच .

  

Here we have been trying for more than one decade for the dissemination of real knowledge across the globe without expecting anything in return .

2) That the literature is set to a metre. 'Prose cannot be orally transmitted'.  

  

                       ------ Vid Achyut Karve

  

This is not correct -- यजुर्वेद is in prose -- अर्थैकत्वात् एकं वाक्यं साकाङ्क्षं चेद्विभागे स्यात् (जैमिनिसूत्रम् - पूर्वमीमांसा - यजुःपरिमाणाधिकरणम् ( how to know the length of a यजुष् = वाक्यम् ) । Many उपनिषत्-s are also in prose .

  

>'Once upon a time' to indicate an event in a far away past whilst Sanskrit to my knowledge has a tense for this purpose.

  

We need to create a different methodology to look into our own antiquity and not jist give in to the recipe developed by the west to investigate their own past.\<

  

This is hundred percent right . These people do not take योगिप्रत्यक्षम् into account .

  

धन्यो’स्मि
