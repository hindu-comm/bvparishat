Dear Vidwans?

  

I am of the view that we need to change the query.

  

Rather than asking the question when was the MB written can we not ask the question what was need for an oral tradition to be scripted.

  

1\) Scripting is necessary when a literary tradition cannot be preserved through an oral tradition.

  

2\) That the nature of the subject is so that the written form is the only form in which it can be preserved for example Euclid's Elements..

  

3\) When the means to ensure continuity of an oral tradition is absent. Absence of guru shishya parampara.

  

4\) Inability to maintain meaning and syntax of a sentence.

  

What are the prerequisites of an oral tradition?

  

1\) The composer needs to be capable to reproduce sequentially his composition.

  

2\) That the literature is set to a metre. 'Prose cannot be orally transmitted'.

  

3\) That the language used has unique characteristics which enable a composer to express himself in chanda form accurately.

  

Regarding the MB the katha of Ganapati commiting to memory Vyasa's composition in one go together with its import suggests that the composition of the MB was way before man thought of scripting literary works.

  

Kathas might not be absolutely true but they surely afford a clue to the nature of the work.

  

I have personally tried to work on such a katha related to the Maheshwar Sutras with respect to its relation to the dhakka with great results.

  

Human history does not start with the invention of the the script. This method of looking at history is itself western. Unfortunately languages other than Sanskrit use the phrase 'Once upon a time' to indicate an event in a far away past whilst Sanskrit to my knowledge has a tense for this purpose.

  

We need to create a different methodology to look into our own antiquity and not jist give in to the recipe developed by the west to investigate their own past.

  

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve
