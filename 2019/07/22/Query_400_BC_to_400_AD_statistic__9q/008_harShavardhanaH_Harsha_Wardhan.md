Sri Korada Subhramanyam garu, namaste.

  

Your statement

  

> do not take योगिप्रत्यक्षम् into account .

  

has significance for me from the yogic point of view.

  

Could you kindly elaborate, with a view to setting our understanding right on the traditional/authoritative point of view, what is meant by योगिप्रत्यक्षम् in our scriptures and their authoritative interpretations.

  

I am interested in exploring योगिप्रत्यक्षम् from the angle of direct (personal) perception as the foundation of (further, second-order) reasoning and (third-party) Apta-vachana-/sruti.

  

Your guidance would be most useful to us.

  

with kind regards

Harsha
