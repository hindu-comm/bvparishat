Namaste Ramakrishnan ji,

  

If your points include that you are well-read, that I could read more, that I might not be reading all things unsaid in your notes: these, I readily concede as much as I am happy to agree. Let me concede more: I certainly have not read hundreds of sources related to the specific topic contained in my original query.

  

If you would indulge more agreement, I am rather inclined to agree with what I could gather from your statement: "Theauthor of the Mahabharata had no use for deductive reasoning to establish when the Mahabharata was composed, he actually knew himself the period of its composition."  

  

With the above said, from this note of yours, I am now a little clearer about both the purpose of your response and to whom your earlier responses were perhaps not intended for. Nevertheless, thank you.

  

Best,

Megh
