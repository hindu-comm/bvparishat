Namaste Ramakrishnan ji,

  

Thank you both your notes.I am trying to understand the deduction involved in the reasoning you have provided and I would be thankful if you can help me see what I may be missing.

[A deductive argument is*sound*if and only if it is both valid, and all of its premises are*actually true*. ...In effect, an argument is*valid*if the truth of the premises logically guarantees the truth of the conclusion.](https://www.iep.utm.edu/val-snd/)

  

If I have not misrepresented your argument in stating them the way I have above, could you help me understand:

1.  how is the deductive argument above both valid and sound? 2.  how is the deduction not simply a part of the Premise 2 being
    stated?  
3.  What reasonable evidence establishes the truth-value of the point
    that A-Sanskrit was spoken in the period 400 BCE to 0 BCE, not
    before 400 BCE but only after 400 BCE?

I am open to the possibility that I might be missing something here and hence this note seeking clarification.

  

Best,

Megh

  

PS Korada Subrahmanyam ji: Thank you very much for your note and for the questions you raised.
