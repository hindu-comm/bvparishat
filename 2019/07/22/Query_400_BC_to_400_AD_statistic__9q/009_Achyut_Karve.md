Dear Vidwans,

  

Many years ago I wanted to read the Mahabharat. Not knowing Sanskrit I started reading the first volume in Marathi and to my surprise I found descriptions of geographical happeninings like volcanoes, earthquakes and floods. I was taken aback.

  

Can anyone throw light on why did the Mahabharat ever have to contain such information.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve
