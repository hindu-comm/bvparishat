Namaste,

  

My query pertains to the statements cited below (highlighted in red) from the article*The Pseudoscience of Indology: An Interview with Joydeep Bagchee*

<http://www.indictoday.com/interviews/the-pseudoscience-of-indology-an-interview-with-joydeep-bagchee/>dated Feb 8th 2019:

**  
**

"For instance, the most widespread statistic about the Mah훮bh훮rata is that it was composed between 400 BC and 400 AD. This statistic is **completely false**. It is **pure conjecture**." (Emphasis added)

  

My query is as follows: Does anyone disagree either with the point that the statistic referred to above is "completely false" or with the point that is "pure conjecture" (or both)?

  

In other words, if anyone has any good reason (or reasons) to assert that the Mah훮bh훮ratawas composed between 400 BC and 400 AD and that such an assertionis neither "completely false" nor "pure conjecture", could s/he share her/his reason or reasons for the same or share a reference that can help address the query reasonably unambiguously.

  

Thanks in advance.

  

Sincerely,  

Megh
