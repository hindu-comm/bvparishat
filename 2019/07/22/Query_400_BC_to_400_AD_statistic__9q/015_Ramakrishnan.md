Dear Megh Ji,  
  
I made those statements to people whom I expect to already know a lot about the topic being discussed, so I have left probably hundreds of things unsaid. My arguments depend as much on what was unsaid (which I consider basic knowledge of the sort that any good vidwan would be expected to know) as on what was said.  
  
That the Paninian Standard was based on standardizing multiple mainstream spoken dialects is a given; that the Mahabharata is not in perfectly Paninian Sanskrit and contains plenty of non-Paninian usages which were yet considered valid sanskrit (arsha prayoga) is well known for thousands of years. There are many other classical Sanskrit works from BCE that diverge from the Paninian standard to various levels - and that too is well known.  
  
If you are expecting me to build a complete argument for your from zero base (assuming complete ignorance, and leaving nothing unstated, in the clearest possible language), that would be quite an onerous task that would serve me no rational purpose.  
  
The author of the Mahabharata had no use for deductive reasoning to establish when the Mahabharata was composed, he actually knew himself the period of its composition. I would suggest a similar approach to you. If you could probably gain a positive understanding of the facts of the case on your own, that would probably make you less reliant on deductive reasoning and more reliant on the facts and actual knowledge as a means to establish the truth. That requires extensive reading from hundreds of sources.  
  
My purpose in responding is to actually glean actual knowedge from vidwans (by way of responses) that I may have missed while reading the hundreds of sources that I have already read, not to make a zero base argument of the sort you are expecting.

  

Best,

Ramakrishnan
