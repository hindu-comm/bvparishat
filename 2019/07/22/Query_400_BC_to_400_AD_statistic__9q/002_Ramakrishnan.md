Namaste,

  

The Mahabharata is not written in perfect Paninian Sanskrit, it is in a vernacular dialect of Sanskrit which was spoken in that period (400 BCE to 0 CE). Maybe there are a few late additions to it, so 400 BCE to 400 CE seems acceptable.

  

It shares certain grammatical and syntactical characteristics with the language of the Buddhist Pāli Canon which was also composed in the same period.

  

Therefore we can be quite confident that this is a reasonably reliable estimate.

  

Regards,

Ramakrishnan.
