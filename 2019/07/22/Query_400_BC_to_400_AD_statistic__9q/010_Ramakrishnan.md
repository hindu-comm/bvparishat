Namaste Korada ji,

  

By dialect, I mean regional varieties of the language. In my understanding Sanskrit had multiple regional dialects in Panini's lifetime (and also in most of the time when the Mahabharata was being composed).  
  
Vernacular means it was spoken by an ethnic group as their native dialect widely for everyday use. In the case of Sanskrit that ethnic group was the Aryans (or Indo-Aryans) of late-Vedic India who were speaking those vernacular dialects of Vedic & Classical Sanskrit.  
  
Paninian Sanskrit is a phonemic and morphological standardization of multiple vernacular dialects of Sanskrit. Panini himself mentions at least two groups of dialects (eastern and northern dialects) if my memory serves me right.  
  
I am not sure if you disagree with this - but my view is that both Vedic Sanskrit and Classical Sanskrit had multiple vernacular dialects.  
  
The Mahabharata (in my current understanding)was written in dialectal sanskrit,and the so-called Arsha prayogas are partly dialectal features - not usages invented by(or unique to) the author of the Mahabharata.  
  
sAdaram,

Ramakrishnan
