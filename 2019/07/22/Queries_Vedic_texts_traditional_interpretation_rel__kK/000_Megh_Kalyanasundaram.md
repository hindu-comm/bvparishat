Namaste,  

  

In*ARYAN PAST AND POST-COLONIAL PRESENT,*L.M. Fosse has stated that Bhagwan Singh's "...construction of the Aryans as merchants andagriculturalists with maritime activities" "...can hardly be justified on the basisof the Vedictexts as traditionally interpreted.**"**

Fosse clearly seems to be writing from a position of 'deep expertise' and 'authority' in traditional interpretation/s (?) of Vedic texts. To make matters less clear, he does not seem to have*explicitly* identified the interpretation/s being referred to as traditional. (I would be most glad to be corrected if have missed any explicit identification, not an inferred one).

  

Queries:

1.  Is Fosse's statement—"It can hardly be justified on the basisof the
    Vedictexts as traditionally interpreted"—the last word in this
    matter, from the point of view of traditional interpretation/s of
    Vedic texts? 2.  Would anyone know if there has been a response to this statement,
    either from Shri Bhagwan Singh ji or from any other scholar familiar
    with traditional interpretation/s of Vedic texts?
3.  Shri Bhagwan Singh ji's (1995) book, in Fosse's own words, was
    apparently a "protestagainst precisely such conclusions," in
    reference to Marshall having mustered, according to Fosse, "cultural
    data from the Veda only to conclude that they differ
    significantlyfrom what we know about the Harappans."One needs to
    guess, thanks to the lack of explicit specificity in Fosse's
    comment, that perhaps Sāyaṇācārya's commentaries might be one (if
    not the only one) being alluded to as traditional interpretation.
    SurelySāyaṇācārya could not have known of a "Proto-Indo-European
    hypothesis" and, specifically in this context, a"Harappan
    civilization". Surely did not have to look for correlations between
    archaeological remains from Harappan civilization and Vedic texts
    as, to start with, there was no Vedic/Harappan binary in
    Sāyaṇācārya'stime. Seen in this light, does anything other than
    examining Bhagwan Singh's scholarship for its own merit make sense
    at all? Therefore, is anyone aware of a point-wise (or at least
    sufficiently detailed but pointed) critique of what Shri Bhagawan
    Singh ji has posited(in, for instance, *[Trade and Commerce in the
    Vedic
    Age](https://archive.org/details/1993bhagwansinghtradeandcommerceinthevedicage)*(1993))
    beyond the seemingly limited (\< than 3 full pages) response of
    Fosse, punctuated by copious ad-hominem though (sample this Fosse
    (1995:442): "However, Singh’s obvious lack of scholarly training
    robs him of the ability to use his reading to his advantage, and the
    views presented on the 500 pages of his book fail dismally to
    convince")?

  

Sincerely,

Megh
