Sorry to be a wet rag or a kill-joy,

  

Samskrita is a language with a lot of gAmbhIryam and most of the rasa of the language is one of gravitas. It is disconcerting to say the least to see commercial b/m/t -ollywood cinematic "mass" scenes /themes being reflected onscreen. And I am still trying to figure out the relevance of the title...
