Dear Ravi,  
  
Thank you for the detailed post and the OCR sample.  
  
1-2. Thank you, this answers my questions. I too have the Cloud  
Vision API, mainly for Roman and Devanagari for now. It's good news  
that Tamil works well too.  
  
3. Worth a try. My FloydHub account could be used if needed, but  
sounds like you probably have your own setup. ( And all the more  
reason in this case to obtain hi res scans.)  
  
4-8 No pressure at all. The scans put on archive were done with  
an iPhone, but I've since upgraded my office scanner to CZUR Aura, so  
a 400-500 page book can be scanned in about an hour, maybe less. The  
software splits the pages while scanning as well, although that's a  
simple script anyway. I'll provide you with Simha samples done with  
that scanner, both in BW and colour modes. If you find that we'd be  
getting better OCR results with CZUR, I can rescan the rest of the  
material. It all depends on what's quicker, to rescan the material  
with CZUR or to spell-correct OCR inaccuracies, hence my curiosity  
about existing Tamil spellcheckers, whether these are part of  
worḍ-processing packages or dedicated software.  
  
9. Agreed, this isn't a textbook. However, practice shows that  
once something is made available to many people, unexpected  
developments arise. There is a lot of creativity in the world, so  
including as many people as possible is a priority, in my view. The  
combination of Hindi and English would cover a large chunk of  
potential readers and contributors.  
  
  
Best wishes,  
Irene
