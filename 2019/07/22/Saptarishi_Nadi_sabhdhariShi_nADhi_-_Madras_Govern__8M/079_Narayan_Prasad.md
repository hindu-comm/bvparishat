Dear Ravi ji,

  

   Thanks for your reply.



  \<\<Want to make sure, is the text getting clipped or is the issue that the split pages have various margins?>\>

  

 It does not matter even if the split pages have various margins. But if on certain page the text gets clipped, it will be an issue.

 If the images are well-centred, there is no problem at all, because the Adobe PDF has a built-in facility to split a large image, without reduction in resolution.

 Please see the attached pic.

  

\<\<Dr.Galstian has done a great job of scanning>\>

  

Exactly. And that also in so small period! It was rather a surprise for me.

When I started this topic, I never expected that the matter would reach so much fruitful stage!

  

\<\<I will continue to research this issue and think of some ways to avoid this situation of imbalanced margins>\>

  

Thanks. This research will be highly useful in general, even if not required in this particular case.

  

Regards

Narayan Prasad
