Dear Dr Prasad,  
  
Thank you for the input. I've just finished the 4th block of Vrsabha  
and will do the 5th in the colour mode for comparison. The 4th block  
is done in BW text mode. Please could you look at that too. The first  
couple of blocks are in grayscale, so more nuance of gray is shown but  
the clarity of characters seems to suffer.  
I understand your situation with Tamil. If you could, please monitor  
the scans for missing pages and note missing pages. I tried to scan  
responsibly but on several occasions I was interrupted by student  
questions, so if an extra pair of eyes checks the scans, we'll correct  
even more errors. Yogananda and Shankara will probably also check the  
scans before they go on [archive.org](http://archive.org).  
  
Best wishes,  

Irene
