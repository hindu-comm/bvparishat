Dear all,

  

This is great work.

  

I noticed that Dr.Galstian has posted 5 lagnas on [archive.org](http://archive.org).

I especially liked the Kanya volume, where CGRajan has interspersed astrological reasoning for some selected

verses. I am also aware of similar analysis of these readings by JNBhasin published in English as Saptarishi Nadi.

  

  

I will try to rotate and split pages and also apply tamil OCR on them and get back to you with results.

Dr.Galstian, I do not see Simha lagna files on the archive page.

Would it be possible to upload at your convenience?

  

Ravi
