Big thanks to the Tamil native speakers and fluent readers who sent  
private messages willing to help decide which scanning mode is easier  
to read. So far BW text mode is the clear winner, and the scanning  
will continue in this mode unless strong arguments are made in favour  
of grayscale (so far the least preferred mode by the reviwers) and  
colour photo. I won't rescan the parts already scanned in colour photo  
mode, since these parts were declared readable.  
  
Thank you,  
Irene
