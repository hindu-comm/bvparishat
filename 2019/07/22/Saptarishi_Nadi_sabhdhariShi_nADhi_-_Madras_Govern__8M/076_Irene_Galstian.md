Many thanks for the update, Ravi!  
If you find faintly scanned pages that resist OCR, please make a note  
of the volume and the page number(s) and send these to me, so I scan  
try rescanning. The reason the scans are uneven is because the print  
itself is uneven in these books.  
  
Thank you,  
Irene
