Happy new year to all!

I have started publishing the translations of the saptarishi nadi horoscopes from the aries ascendant collection in my website [here](https://madhivanan.in/translated-horoscopes-saptarishi-nadi/). As of now, 6 horoscopes are online; more will follow. These horoscopes have been translated by Yenbeeyes and edited by me after proofreading with the palm manuscripts and incorporating the changes; so, the planetary positions differ from those in the book in some cases.
