\<\<It might make sense to save the scans in 300 or so page blocks, sincethe files will be gigantic otherwise. Please sendthoughts/instructions so I can get going.>\>

  

It depends on how you want to save the scanned files.

    If it is only the pdf format, a book could be divided into a few parts of about 300 to 500 pages.

    Spacewise, it could be about 50 MB to a maximum of 100 MB per file.

  

    But if maximum resolution is the aim, better to save each scanned page (two pages of the printed text could be scanned as one) as tiff file and all such scanned tiff files in a single folder. From these tiff files one can prepare a single file of about 500 pp or so as pdf or djvu.
