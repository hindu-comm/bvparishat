Dear Ravi ji,  

 வணக்கம்!

  

  Thank you very much for your recent messages, esp. regarding Tamil OCR and writing code to rotate, split images and also figure out how to

remove shadows as well as compress the images without losing quality.

 

\<\<I have attached example of a page (scanned by Dr.Galstian), along with split and enhanced version.>\>

  

BTW, the scan of joint pp.18-19 from the Taurus lagna has both pages with almost same width.

  

Could you attach pp.180-181 of the Taurus lagna before and after split, in which the width is not the same and there is a shadowy part in the left margin of page 180?

There should be at least about 5 mm right margin on page 180 after split.

  

\<\<I will also share code on my github once I finish this successfully.>\>

  

In that case, it will be highly useful for application in general.

  

Regards

Narayan Prasad
