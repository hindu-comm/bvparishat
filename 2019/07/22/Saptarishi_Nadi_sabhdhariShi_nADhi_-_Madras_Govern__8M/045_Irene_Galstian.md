Update: all except Simha are now complete.  
  
Missing pages have been inserted into archive copies of Kanya and Mesha.  
However, Mesha will be rescanned because the archive copy is too  
grainy to be readable by Tamil readers. I've started on rescanning  
Mesha before doing Simha because a fair number of pages in the Simha  
volume need to be cut first; waiting to borrow a good paper knife.  
  
In the meantime, if you find missing or unreadable pages, please write  
as soon as you can, so this can be corrected.  
  
Thank you,  
Irene
