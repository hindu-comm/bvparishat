Ravi,  
  
I'm in the process of writing the code, since it seems easier to do  
that than to be limited by the 25 page limit.  
Apologies for the earlier awkward phrasing. I meant to say that most  
of my Cloud API work is with English and Devanagari documents, and I  
haven't tried Tamil OCR because I was on the lookout for a Tamil  
reader who'd have a go and assess the OCR quality - and you appeared!  
  
Irene
