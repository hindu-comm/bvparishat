Dear Dr Irene Galstian,

  Namaste!

  It was a great pleasure to see scans of 170+151 sheets (one sheet containing 2 pp of the printed text) in so short time!

  I had a cursory look at the two files. The scans are B/W. Could you just send a few sample pages in color to check whether it will increase readability?

  In already sent b/w scans, a zoom of 200% makes the Tamil characters fairly readable. However, in certain pages the scan appears to be faint. But maybe, this is due to the original print itself being faint.

  BTW, I am a North Indian from the Hindi belt. My knowledge of Tamil is highly limited. I do not know enough Tamil to translate the text. But there is no problem in recognizing the Tamil characters and make out the Tamil words of Sanskrit origin.

  Prof. Yogananda CS will be a better person to judge.

  

\<\<Question: do we rescan Kanya, or just scan the missing pages to complete the[archive.org](http://archive.org/)file?>\>

  

 The scan of Kanya Lagna is very good. Only missing pages need to be scanned.

  

  Thanks and regards

  Narayan Prasad
