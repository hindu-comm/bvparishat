Got all 6 out. They vary in length:  
  
Mesha 904p  
Vrsabha 1447p  
Mithuna 1050p  
Karka 1267p  
Simha 2007p  
Kanya 626p  
  
It might make sense to save the scans in 300 or so page blocks, since  
the files will be gigantic otherwise. Please send  
thoughts/instructions so I can get going.  
  
As for the rest of the volumes, I've written to the person in charge  
of library acquisitions to see if he's ever seen any of the volumes  
after Kanya anywhere.
