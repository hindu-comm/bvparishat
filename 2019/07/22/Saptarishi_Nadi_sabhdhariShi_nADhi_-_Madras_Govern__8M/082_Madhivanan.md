Hi to all,

As coronavirus is taking its toll, the world is finding it tough to come to terms with this pandemic. Regarding saptarishi nadi, kindly post any updates regarding any work done on this. As to myself, i have uploaded translations of 10 horoscopes in my website. also, i have completed proof reading of the complete aries lagna collection with the manuscript, and i have noted some important changes. i am working on translating the rest of the horoscopes.

One important outcome of researching Saptarishi Nadi is the knowledge that the saptarishis used tropical zodiac. Accordingly, I analyzed the astrology of the pandemic using tropical zodiac in the month of May and posted an article in my website [here](https://madhivanan.in/coronavirus-pandemic-when-will-it-end-astrological-analysis/). I have borrowed ideas from others, whom i have acknowledged, and analyzed it using tropical zodiac. What has transpired over these months strengthens my conviction that tropical zodiac is the zodiac used by our saptarishis. Kindly decide for yourself after going through that article. As to the pandemic, the worst is yet to come. the approaching solar eclipse and the conjunction of Saturn and debilitated Jupiter in mid December is a cause for worry.

Kindly keep us posted of any developments regarding Saptarishi Nadi done over these many months. I will be grateful if the Simha lagna collection is shared, and this appeal goes to Mr. Irene Galstein; that would then complete the 6 published lagna collection. The library was supposed to publish the rest of the volumes by now; if there is any update on this, i would be happy to hear.

Hoping for some good news in this regard amid the depressing pandemic. Thanks in advance.

  

Dr. Madhivanan.
