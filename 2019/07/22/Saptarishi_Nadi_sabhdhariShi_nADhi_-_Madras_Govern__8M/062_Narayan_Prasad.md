\<\<This is very good of you. I’ll renew the books and wait for an indication from you to return them.>\>

  

I have just completed checking the scanned pages for Mesha, Taurus, Mithuna and Karka.

All pages have been scanned, except pp.52-53 in Taurus 1 of 5. Dr Madhivanan has alsoalready indicated these missing pages.

In Karka 1 of 4, page CLviii has been wrongly printed as CLiii.

Thanks and regards

Narayan Prasad
