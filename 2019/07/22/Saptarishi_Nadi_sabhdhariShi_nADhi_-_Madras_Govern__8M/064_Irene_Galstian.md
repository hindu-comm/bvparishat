Dr Madhivanan,  
  
Your post certainly addresses valid points. My own perception is as follows:  
  
1. Sharing or not of something one has isn't a matter of conscience  
but of goodwill. Goodwill can only be granted willingly, it can't  
begged, threatened or cajoled. We can only be sincerely grateful for  
what we receive from such goodwill and not make people feel guilty for  
what they aren't willing to share. That is their choice.  
  
2. The manuscript scans I've seen so far are done is a relatively low  
resolution, which compounds the difficulty of deciphering. Sooner or  
later someone will read this thread who has high resolution scans and  
is willing to share them. Or someone might volunteer to go to Chennai  
and produce such scans (this could be one of us, as our circumstances  
allow).  
  
3. Considering how much scanned printed matter we already have  
available, deciphering manuscripts isn't our priority as a whole.  
  
3a. However, Sampath Kumar has indicated that this is his priority,  
and as part of his own project he'll be redering all of us the  
valuable favour of posting deciphered Tamil verses on this thread.  
It's important that we're fully appreciative of Sampath Kumar's  
cooperation and generosity, and if anyone here can reciprocate by  
cross-checking the verses with the manuscript, perhaps this person  
would be assisting Sampath Kumar in return.  
  
3b. In the meantime, all we have to do is encourage people to  
translate the scanned printed matter from Tamil into English. If there  
are people who are willing/able to translate from Tamil into Hindi,  
that too would be useful. Either way, this skill isn't very hard to  
find.  
  
4. As the translation progresses and reaches the proofreading stage,  
it's well to also double-check the astrological accuracy of the charts  
and add editorial comments. You discovered and corrected some errors,  
and there could well be others in the remaining volumes. I suggest  
that the translation be done exactly as per the printed original, and  
then editorial comments would clearly indicate whether the given  
correction came from the manuscript or editor's own astrological  
calculations.  
  
Best wishes,  
Irene
