Dear Scholars,  

 Namaste!

 I would like to know whether this book is available on the net anywhere for all the 12 lagnas. I have seen the printed copy only for the first six available at BORI.

 On the net I could trace only the copy of Kanya Lagnam.

 Any English translation of this important book ?

 Thanks and regards

 Narayan Prasad
