The position of Mercury displayed in that link is Scorpio. it has been arrived at using a hypothetical time of birth. But the position of Mercury specified by saptarishis is Sagittarius, and i have given the proof for that. To clarify again, the position of Mercury in the printed book is aquarius; in the specified link is Scorpio; the position mentioned in the palm manuscript is Sagittarius. Kindly check. Hope this clarifies this issue.
