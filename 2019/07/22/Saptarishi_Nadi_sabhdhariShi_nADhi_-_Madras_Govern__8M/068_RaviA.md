Dear team, (Prasad, Shankara, Yogananda, Dr.Galstian, Mathivanan, Yenbeeyes)

  

  Happy New Year to all!  

  

  1. I have completed OCR of the Kanya lagna book using Google Cloud Vision OCR (which is a paid service I have used). I have attached links to the un-edited Word doc and plain text versions.

    I am sharing the result in the spirit of open sharing, just like you and others who have shared the scans themselves.

    I can provide edit rights to whoever is planning to edit and probably add translations in place there.

  

  2. Google Cloud OCR is pretty good. I have not read through this particular book yet, but I find only about one or two errors per page if the scan is good quality.

    In addition Google OCR can automatically identify and transcribe multiple languages in same document. I do not know of other solutions which have similar capabilities/qualities.

    

   3. Google OCR is only for printed text now. One may train special algorithms for manuscript text. For example if one aligns entire mesham readings and their already available text as training data, one can build a manuscript ocr algorithm.

  

   4. The Kanya seems to be using a high resolution scan. I am yet to start on Mesha and other scans for OCR. Hope to do it over the coming weeks.

  

   5. As you and others may know, the 'professional' archival solution for scanning is to purchase a overhead (nondestructive) book scanner, I will mention two options here: A low cost personal solution would be a scanner : Fujitsu ScanSnap:<https://www.fujitsu.com/us/products/computing/peripheral/scanners/scansnap/sv600/>about $500 available in India too. It would take about two to three hours to scan a 300 page book and finish its editing into a quality PDF. (OCR available in-built for English and European languages)

  

  6. The archival standard solution is a scanning workstation BookEye v4 that would cost more than $20000 but a book can be scanned with little hand edits in less than an hour.

  7. I guess that Mesha and Kanya were scanned at DLI which used to have special purpose Minolta scanners.

  

  8. Bottomline, I think your scans should be good enough for practical purposes. Let me progress and let you know.

  

  9. Not to discourage the project itself, but I make these observations:

        1. There is only little bit of explicit astrological reasoning in each reading of 40 or so poems. This is when one rishi is questioned by Parvathi or other rishi.

           All the rest is just predictions without reasoning.

        2. The benefit in this case is mostly that these are case histories of horoscopes of specific people, who lived around 1880s - or were reborn for nth time around that time :) -

          with not much clue on how the readings were done.

        3. The other benefit is to understand the astrological and astronomical systems used during the times these were written.

        4. For an extremely intelligent expert astrologer, the reading itself may fill gaps in knowledge and reinforce their knowledge,

            but a non-astrologer and a learning astrologer, can understand close to nothing from these books.

        5. The best way to benefit is for an expert astrologer to do a blind reading of the chart first on the following questions:

                  male or female

                  father siblings and father's characteristics

                  mother siblings and characteristrics

                  natives siblings

                  natives education and trade

                  wife and characteristics

                  children

                  timing of marriage, childbirths

                  timing of deaths of father, mother, native

                  and then read up what the book said.

         6. So while this is a rare book of systematic readings AND I have reasons to believe that the readings are fairly stunningly accurate,

           these are not text books but case histories.

  So we can only get as much as we put in to 'decipher' the *readings* themselves and what we get would be only what we put in.

  

  

Regards and best wishes

Ravi
