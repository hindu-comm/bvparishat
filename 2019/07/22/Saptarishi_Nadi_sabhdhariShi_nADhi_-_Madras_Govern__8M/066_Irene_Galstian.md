Dear Ravi,

  

Thank you for mentioning the possibility of OCR. If you can do even a bit, that would be quite nice. We could then see how viable OCR is and what kind of spell-checking can help with OCR errors to produce more or less viable Tamil text. By the way, do you know of a Tamil OCR solution that's better than Google's?

  

Simha will be done, that's not the issue here. As you see, 5 lagnas are uploaded and are being worked on little by little by a number of people. At the same time, I've been looking for ways of obtaining high resolution scans of the remaining lagnas that can be be shared with everybody. The problem with the scans we have so far is that they are done in low resolution and, what's more important, their owners don't want to share them with everybody.

  

As you can see, there are 2 streams to this.

  

1\. If the case study is already in printed form, it's helpful to have people with enough Tamil and astrology knowledge to translate it into Hindi or English. Remember that as long as the case studies exist only in Tamil, the world at large can't benefit from them.

  

2\. If the case study is still in manuscript form, we've got to obtain shareable hi res scans and perform 1. on these. Thus, it would be good to find contacts of people in Chennai who are willing and able to help with this step.

  

As has been observed already, there are some mistakes in the case studies. This is fine. The priority now is to translate the text exactly as it is. Checking can be done later. Note also that the more people have access to the case studies, the quicker and the more fruitful the checking of the calculations will be. This is another reason I think that it's better to translate them as soon as possible in the proceedings. I'm preparing a small system to keep track of all this.

  

I'd like to take this opportunity to wish everybody on BVP a wonderful new year, full of joy and inspiration.

  

Irene
