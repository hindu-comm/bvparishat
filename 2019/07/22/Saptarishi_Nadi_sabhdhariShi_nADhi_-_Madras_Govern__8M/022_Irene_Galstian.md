Let's try to optimise this somehow, assuming I'd still use the iPhone.  
  
Question: who knows a good iOS app that can scan to tiff? I've got an  
iPhone 6s iOS 12.1.4  
and usually use ScannerPro (it can't do TIFFs). I've downloaded  
Scanbot just now to test it in action. Please reply with your  
suggestions so I can download and test them. If there's a way of  
producing TIFFs as Yoga suggested, it might be possible to find it.
