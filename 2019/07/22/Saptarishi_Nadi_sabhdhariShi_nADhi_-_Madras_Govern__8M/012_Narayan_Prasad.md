\<\< Rearrangement can be a significant alteration.>\>  

  

Shree Prabha versions do not appear to contain the original old text, as the preview indicates.

Moreover, the presentation of the results are also completely different. The text has been made simple and in modern Tamil.

It is preferable to have a look at the available MGOS version on the net and the corresponding preview on the Exotic India site.

Regards

Narayan Prasad
