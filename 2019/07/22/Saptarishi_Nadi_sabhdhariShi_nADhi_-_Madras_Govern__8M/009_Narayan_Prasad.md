\<\< Is it certain that all12 volumes exist?>\>

  

I have seen printed copy only for the initial six lagnas.

  

\<\<So that we don't double up in the search, please coud you list what you've tried already to locate these books.>\>

  

As already pointed out, Shree Prabha Publications appear to have published for the first three lagnas. From the preview it appears that this 2015 edition is differently arranged from the earlier ones published under Madras Government Oriental Series (MGOS).

  

Regards

Narayan Prasad
