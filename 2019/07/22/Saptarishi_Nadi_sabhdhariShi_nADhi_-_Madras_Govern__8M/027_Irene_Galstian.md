I've just done the 2nd block of 300 pages, same folder.  
I'll be away for a little while answering student queries, but will  
continue scanning afterwards. If the scans are legible, then the whole  
lot shouldn't take more than 2 weeks.  
  
Question: do we rescan Kanya, or just scan the missing pages to  
complete the [archive.org](http://archive.org) file?
