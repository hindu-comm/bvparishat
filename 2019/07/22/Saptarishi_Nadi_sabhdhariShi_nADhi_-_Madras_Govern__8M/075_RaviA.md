Team, I am happy to share some progress.

  

By God's grace, I was able to write some code to rotate, split images and also (unexpectedly) figure out how to

remove shadows as well as compress the images without losing quality.

  

I have attached example of a page (scanned by Dr.Galstian), along with split and enhanced version.

  

  

I will process the Vrisabha book 1 in entirety and share a concise single page version hopefully today.

And also will try OCR on that. I will also share code on my github once I finish this successfully.

  

Ravi
