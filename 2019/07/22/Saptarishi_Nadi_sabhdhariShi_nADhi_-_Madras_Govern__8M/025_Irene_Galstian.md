I've just scanned and shared the first 300 or so pages of Taurus, you  
and Yoga should get the notifications soon. Please examine the scan. I  
can only read Sanskrit in Tamil script, but if I were presented with  
this scan, I'd say it's readable. Part of the problem is thin pages  
with print showing through.
