Dear Scholars,  

  Namaste!

  It was scanned from a copy available at University of Jodhpur Library.

  

  Another copy of the first six lagnas are available at Madras Oriental Library:

    "For the first 6 Lagnas beginning from Aries to Virgo, one copy of a printed book is available in Madras Oriental Library. They also do not allow us to scan the book."

  

 But in the copy available for Kanya Lagnam on the net, the following pages are missing:

   Part-I : pp.200, 201, 205, 412, 413, 442, 443, 492, 493.

   Part-II: pp.602, 603.

  

   Page not properly readable: Part-II: p.13.

  

   Pages duplicate: Part-I: pp.554, 555.

  

  Regards

  Narayan Prasad
