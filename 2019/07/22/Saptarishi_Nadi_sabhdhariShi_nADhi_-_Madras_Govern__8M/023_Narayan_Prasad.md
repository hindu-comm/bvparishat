\<\< I understand, but I can't commit this kind of time, nor do I have asuitable app. As it is, scanning this set means scanning 3,500+ 2-pagescans. In addition, the books are very thick, e.g. the Simha one is  
about 12cm, so laying these flat enough to scan while still protectingthe spine to preserve the book's life is going to be needed.>\>

  

If iPhone is the most convenient for you to scan, and which should not damage the longevity of the book, only one printed page at a time has to be scanned. I think, the file type of this scan would be jpg. This also can be accumulated as one file to pdf or djvu format.

  

The work will be certainly a very time-consuming one. I think, in one sitting it may be a boring task to scan more than about 50 to 100 pages. Moreover, it all depends on your commitments in hand about important research oriented work. So this work is not expected to be done in a few days, but maybe months.

Narayan Prasad
