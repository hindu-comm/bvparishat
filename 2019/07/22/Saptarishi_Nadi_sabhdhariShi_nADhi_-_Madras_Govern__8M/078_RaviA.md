Narayan Prasad-ji

  

Thank you!

  

Let me research the issue you are talking about. Want to make sure, is the text getting clipped or is the issue that the split pages have various margins?

  

As long as the text does not get cut, the situation is not very bad.

  

Dr.Galstian has done a great job of scanning and I was surprised to most (if not all) pages are relatively well centered.

I will continue to research this issue and think of some ways to avoid this situation of imbalanced margins.

I have also uploaded remaining volumes of Vrishabha to my google docs page, and will be uploading Mithuna too,

so if you or any one can look through to see any pages that need a rescan, we can request Dr.Galstian.

  

Ravi
