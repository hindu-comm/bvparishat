1\. Here's what's been scanned so far:  
  
<https://archive.org/details/mgos_20190802>  
  
I'm still working on Simha.  
If you find missing or unclear pages, please report them in this thread.  
  
2. Since the remaining 6 lagnas are still in manuscript form, your  
help is needed. If you already have the scans, please consider sharing  
them. Otherwise, if you are reliable and located in or near Chennai,  
please consider going to GOML and scanning these manuscripts. There  
are also other items at GOML that several scholars are looking for. If  
you're willing to help, please reply. Since cooperation is by  
definition a 2-sided thing, please send the list of items you're  
trying to obtain, so more people can look for them and maybe obtain  
them quicker.  
  
Thank you,  
Irene
