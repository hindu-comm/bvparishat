Sorry, didn't finish the message.  
I'd normally save the scans as PDFs. Fancy things, like saving each  
page separately, I can't do for reasons of time, sorry. If having a  
number of 300 page PDFs solves your problem and can potentially make  
these books available to others, I will gradually do it.
