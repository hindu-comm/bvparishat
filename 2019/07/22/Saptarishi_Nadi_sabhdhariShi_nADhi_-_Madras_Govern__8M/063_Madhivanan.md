The participants in this topic all share a common interest on Saptarishi Nadi gifted by our saptarishis. We realize and appreciate the importance of this monumental work by saptarishis. This is a boon by saptarishis for our mankind.

Our government has brought out six ascendant publications and no more. That too, those books are in Tamil, and therefore cannot be read by non-Tamil people. Luckily, these books are out of copyright, I presume, and therefore interested scholars can translate them into English. Here, I wish to make a point. There are errors in the published works, as has been pointed out by Yenbeeyes in his translations. Before translating them, it is advisable to proofread the verses with the palm manuscript. I know this first hand as I have proofread the Aries ascendant verses. Any attempt at translating the Aries collection should incorporate these corrections as they are vital to astrological interpretation.

Also, the other six ascendant collections are yet to be deciphered and translated in Tamil/English. In this modern age, the skills necessary to decipher, assimilate, and translate those verses without any mistakes is not common. Indeed, I think it is rare to find someone interested in astrology with a command over English language (for translation) and the necessary skills to decipher the verses from the Tamil manuscript.

In this regard, I find that even those who possess the manuscripts of Saptarishi Nadi are very secretive about it and donâ€™t want to share it with those who can decipher it. There is a good chance that a few of them may be members of this forum. It will be a grave loss to Indian astrology to have those manuscripts and yet not decipher them or share them with someone who can decipher/translate. If the present generation is unable to decipher the manuscripts, the chances that the next generation will decipher it are even less.

I understand that those who possess the manuscripts have acquired them with great effort; not deciphering them will be a waste of all those efforts. Advising those interested in deciphering them to undergo the same hardships they experienced in acquiring the manuscripts may be a logical one, but then that would defeat the very purpose of this forum. Again, it is up to their conscience to decide if they are willing to share those manuscripts with others. All I can do is appeal to their good selves in making the precious knowledge of saptarishis accessible to humanity.

Kindly note that this is not directed at anyone in particular. Thank you.
