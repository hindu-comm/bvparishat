Hello C. R. Bala,  
  
Thank you so much for this important clarification!  
The 6 published volumes will go on archive. If Shri Shankara will accept them into the collection under his management, then he’ll upload them. If not, other methods will be found, but these case studies will be made available. This is why they’re being scanned.  
  
A request, if I may. Since you know that the remaining lagnas are available in manuscript form, are you able to scan them? Or maybe someone has scanned these manuscripts already? Let’s find or make these scans, gradually produce from them the remaining volumes and make them available. A collection of case studies like this is too valuable to neglect.  
  
Irene
