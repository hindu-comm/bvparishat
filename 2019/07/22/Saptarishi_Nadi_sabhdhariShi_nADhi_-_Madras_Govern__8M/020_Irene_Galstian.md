I understand, but I can't commit this kind of time, nor do I have a  
suitable app. As it is, scanning this set means scanning 3,500+ 2-page  
scans. In addition, the books are very thick, e.g. the Simha one is  
about 12cm, so laying these flat enough to scan while still protecting  
the spine to preserve the book's life is going to be needed.
