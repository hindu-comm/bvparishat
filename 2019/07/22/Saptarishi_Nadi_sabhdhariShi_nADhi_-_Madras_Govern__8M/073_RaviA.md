Team,



> I have uploaded single page versions of Vrishab 1 and 2 books, to my > google doc share.



Also I have uploaded the code I have written for rotate-split-enhance-compress-write of pdf scans into these.

  

The code has been shared as jupyter notebook as well as html viewable doc.

  

I notice that some page scans are rather light in the scan. I will try OCR tomorrow and provide feedback if there is a need to rescan specific pages.

Comments welcome.
