Hi Irene  
Raam raam  
Sri maha periyava charanam.  
Firstly thanks for the scanning those books and i hope it will uploaded in archive and link will be shared in forum.  
After kanya lagna no other volumes were published. Don't know the reason why government funding stopped in publishing other works. But all the twelve lagnas are available in manuscript which is preserved in GOML Madras.

Thanks  
C.R.Bala
