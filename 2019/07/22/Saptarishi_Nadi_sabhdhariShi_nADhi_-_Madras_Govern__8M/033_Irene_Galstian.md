Thank you. Kanya missing pages now uploaded and need to be integrated  
into the existing file and reuploaded to archive.  
  
If this leaves us with Mithuna, Karka, Simha, my earlier estimate of 2  
weeks is too long, unless something unusual happens. Please try to  
respond with preferences of scan mode: grayscale photo, colour photo  
or bw text. Tomorrow is another student-filled day, and I'll be doing  
scanning in between.
