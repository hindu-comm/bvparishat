\<\< Let's try to optimise this somehow, assuming I'd still use the iPhone.>\>  

  

Let it be iPhone. The tiff file scanning may be left out to Google. For common people pdf file will be sufficient, if the scans have enough readability.

I scan using HP Scanjet G3110. It does have facility to scan as tiff. Later I convert tiff files to pdf and djvu. Generally I delete tiff files, unless very high resolution is needed in rare cases.

Narayan Prasad
