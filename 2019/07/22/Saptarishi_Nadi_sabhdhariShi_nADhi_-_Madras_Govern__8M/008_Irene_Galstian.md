I've written to Exotic India to see if they can obtain the full set  
from the publisher. If they can, I'll try to negotiate a price for the  
set and see where that gets us.  
WorldCat doesn't bring up holdings of these, but it could be that they  
are catalogued differently.  
So far I haven't come across anybody who has seen the complications  
for Libra, Scorpio and Sagittarius in person. Is it certain that all  
12 volumes exist?  
So that we don't double up in the search, please coud you list what  
you've tried already to locate these books.
