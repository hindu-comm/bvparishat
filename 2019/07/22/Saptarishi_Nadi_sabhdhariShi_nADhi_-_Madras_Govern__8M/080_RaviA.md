1\. I have slightly improved the shadow removal and now placed Mesha and Vrishabha volumes in google docs location.

  

2\. I am attaching the unsplit page p109 from Dr.Galstian's scan of Vrshabha and the corresponding split pages of 180 and 181 from Vrshabha,

I do not see any clipping here. Do you see issues?
