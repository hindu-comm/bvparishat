The published copy of the aries lagna of Saptarishi Nadi is available on [archive.org](http://archive.org). I am indebted for the good-hearted persons who have shared that with the whole world. I have extensively studied that collection, and I found out that some important corrections need to be made to the published work.

For example, horoscope no. 2 in the print book mentions Mercury in Aquarius. The Tamil verse reads “மதிசனி மாதையாக மால்தினும் சேயும் சாடி”. However, upon referring to the palm manuscript, I found this.

It reads “மதிசனி மாதையாக மால்தனு சேயும் சாடி”. Therefore, Mercury is placed in Sagittarius. Even otherwise, Mercury cannot be placed so far away from the Sun, anyway. There are many more major corrections and a lot more minor corrections to be incorporated in that published work.

I have published an eBook on that collection, the details of which has been shared in this forum earlier. Of the 78 horoscopes, 63 horoscopes have been dealt with in that eBook, and I have corrected the planetary positions, if any, for those horoscopes. Indeed, three horoscopes from that collection actually belong to Cancer ascendant.   
Likewise, remaining dasa periods which are not mentioned in the print book, have been mentioned in the eBook after referring to the verses. In fact, I have found numerous corrections in the print book, and these can be corrected only if another edition of that book is published.

For those interested in comparing the horoscopes in the published volume and my ebook, I will supply the corresponding horoscope numbers if you drop me a mail.  

Hope this helps.
