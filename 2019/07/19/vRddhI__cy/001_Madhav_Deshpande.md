I wish the questioner would consult the basic works like Patañjali's Mahābhāṣya before raising such questions. On the Śivasūtras e o Ṅ and ai au C, Patañjali describes the sounds ai and au as *samāhāravarṇa* "composit sounds." \[इमावैचौ समाहारवर््णौ मात्रावर्णस्य मात्रेवर्णोवर्णयो:\]. He further says: ऐचोश्च उत्तरभूयस्त्वात् "the latter component in these is larger," and in another place he says विवृततरावर्णौ एतौ "the component 'a' in these sounds is more open," distinguishing it from the normal short 'a' which is described as *saṃvr̥ta*"close." On the other hand, the sounds *e* and *o*are dasescribed as being प्रश्लिष्टावर्णौ "with the sound 'a' fused with (*i* and *u*). In other sources, the sounds *ai* and *au* are described as being *dvivarṇa*. No source describes long आ as being composed of two components. No grammarian has made a claim that all sounds that come under the term *vr̥ddhi*have two components. Hope this answers your question.
