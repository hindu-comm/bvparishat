I read your post, and my memory flashed back to a quote by Lev Landau  
I came across when I was 12-13: "...надо меньше думать об основах.  
Главное, чем надо овладеть, — это техникой работы, а понимание  
тонкостей само придёт потом."  
Translation: Think less about foundations. The main thing to master is  
the work technique, and the understanding of subtleties will come by  
itself later.
