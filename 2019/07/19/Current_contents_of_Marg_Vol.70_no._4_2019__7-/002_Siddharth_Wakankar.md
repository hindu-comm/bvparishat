Dear scholars,

  

The Oriental Institute,Baroda,used to get on Exchange Basis nearly two hundred Indological Journals from all over the world and our Journal of the Oriental Institute,Baroda,used to be dispatched to those institutes with my signature.

  

We had a long list of such Research Journals which had exchange relations with our Journals,one in English and the other Swadhyay in Gujarati.

  

I do not know the present position,which can be had by contacting the Incharge Director of the O.I.  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
