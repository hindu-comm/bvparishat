Please God that someone hears and acts on Prof. Kannan's suggestion.  
Reputable and well-managed lists like this one could be a goldmine of  
information, even though their value is already great. There could be  
a thread dedicated to Tables of Contents, and a thread for reviews,  
for example. There could be a thread where publishers could announce  
new releases and supply links to their catalogs. There could also be a  
thread where booksellers could announce availability of titles in  
stock. There is a huge potential for mutual benefit here, with  
relatively small effort.
