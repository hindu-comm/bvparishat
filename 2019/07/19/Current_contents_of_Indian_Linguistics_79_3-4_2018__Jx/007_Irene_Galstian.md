Here's a report on the Praci-Jyoti situation, as of right now.  
I asked for the Interlibrary Loans librarian's help in tracing the  
2005-present issues. We couldn't find any major US universities that  
subscribe to Praci-Jyoti, not even Harvard. As for the UK holdings,  
SOAS seems to have up to 2008, and we're waiting for response from  
Bodleian, who said that they subscribe but the periodical is years  
behind. Nobody in the UK seems to have the up to date collection of  
this periodical, and no librarian so far could work out how to get in  
touch with the publisher.  
So... If your institution subscribes to Praci-Jyoti, or you have  
access to it through some online portal, or you know how to access  
whoever is in charge of this mysterious publication, please reply with  
information, and I'll pass it on to our librarian.  
The librarians I've consulted mentionde that things used to be much  
better with Indian publications, along the lines of Prof. Wakankar's  
description in his post.
