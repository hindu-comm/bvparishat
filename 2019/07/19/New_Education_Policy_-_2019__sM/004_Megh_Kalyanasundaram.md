Namaste,

  

While the 4 points enumerated below are some amongst those that resonated (notwithstanding the point on detail, which might perhaps follow), [this](https://meghk.wordpress.com/2019/06/19/national-education-policy-nep-2019-citizen-consultation-input-in-response-to-suggestions-solicited-by-mygovindia/) is one suggestion that was submitted in response to the citizen consultation inputs solicited.

  

1.  “As so many developed countries around the world have amply
    demonstrated, being well educated in one’s language, culture, and
    traditions is not a detriment but indeed a huge benefit to
    educational, social, and technological advancement. For this reason,
    it is strongly recommended that India’s languages, art, and culture
    be given a prominence again that has been lost in recent years.
    These cultural resources of one’s country help make the people human
    beings equipped with cultural values, identity, and expression,
    which is necessary to work efficiently, creatively, and with
    happiness. India’s languages are among the richest, most scientific,
    most beautiful, and most expressive in the world, with a huge body
    of ancient as well as modern literature (both prose and poetry),
    along with films, and music that help form India’s national identity
    and wealth. For purposes of cultural enrichment as well as national
    integration, all young Indians should be aware of the rich and vast
    array of languages of their country, and the treasures that they and
    their literatures contain.” (p. 85)

2.  “Course on the Languages of India: Every student in the country will
    take a fun course on “The Languages of India” sometime in Grades
    6-8. In this course, students will learn about the remarkable unity
    of most of the major Indian languages, starting with their common
    phonetic and scientiﬁcally arranged alphabets and scripts, their
    common grammatical structures, their origins and sources of
    vocabularies from Sanskrit and other classical languages, as well as
    their rich inter-inﬂuences and differences.” (p. 85)

3.  Study of Sanskrit and knowledge of its extensive literature:
    Sanskrit has been a great repository of knowledge pertaining to
    numerous subjects including science, mathematics, medicine,
    mathematics, law, economics, politics, music, linguistics, drama,
    storytelling, architecture, and more, by authors from all walks of
    life. (p. 86)

4.  "As consequences of basic ethical reasoning as in P4.6.8.1,
    traditional Indian values of seva, ahimsa, swacchata, satya, nishkam
    karma, tolerance, honest hard work, respect for women, respect for
    elders, respect for all people and their inherent capabilities
    regardless of background, respect for environment, etc. will be
    inculcated in students. Scientiﬁcally speaking, these qualities are
    extremely important for society’s and India’s progress.” (p. 96)

  

Best,

Megh
