Thanks, Sri Sriram for making this available in this forum.

It talks of multi-disciplinary institutions/ universities for higher education. It is not clear how Sanskrit Universities fit into this template. It is almost 500 pages. I could not locate anything specific to Gurukula system nurtured by MaThas and Madrasa system run by Islamic Institution and how they get integrated into the mainstream.

Thanks and regards,

Murthy
