Namaste,

  

I was going thru the New Education Policy - 2019, the revised edition.

  

Page No. 86 vide P4.5.13 discusses "**Incorporation of relevant excerpts from great works of Indian Literature throughout the curriculum**" and subsequently

the P4.5.14 "**Study of Sanskrit**".

  

While it is heartening to see the sanskrit literature being introduced in NEP, but what does the "3-Language Formula" say about this ?

  

rgs,

sriram
