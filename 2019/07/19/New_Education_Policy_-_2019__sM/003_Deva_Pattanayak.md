Dear Sriram_ji and all members of BVP,

  

Thank you Sriram_ji for sending the draft of the national Educational Policy.

  

It reads well. It fails miserably in details. Because of the following reasons;

  

1\. It does not start with the current condition of education with hard facts and figures.

2\. It rightfully emphasizes the importance of quality early education period, the first five years of schooling. It is suggesting for a teacher student ratio of 30:1 plus additional resources, but is almost silent in its implementation.

3\. It advocates exposure of three languages: mother tongues, classical language and English ( my list that will make sense). This will essentially triplicate number of teachers needed. This may not work in early stages because it requires a supporting environment at home and society level. A big jump from the present condition where there are hardly functioning schools with required number of teachers, (at least one teacher per thirty students per grade)

4\. In its budget section it uses the term additional resources needed rather than going into actual numbers. It calls for implementation by 2030, a ten year vision that is to do little now.

5\. Access to the detail background communications and proceedings between the committee most likely is not available in a transparent way. Who said what etc.

  

Here are my thoughts:

  

State Governments take full responsibility of education till high school.

  

Federal and State Governments work together ( 50:50) to support quality undergraduate education. Upto Bachelor level in all subjects.  

  

Federal Government takes full responsibility of higher education ( Graduate, Masters and Ph.D.)

  

Private Entities can set up educational entities at all levels in a manner of their choice subject to law of the land.

  

I hope each member of this BVP analyzes this very important draft. We may send a collective response to the ministry of HRD.

  

Thank you

Deva
