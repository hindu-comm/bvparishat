Thank you Jayaraman for this soul stirring composition on Raghu-Rama. The singer Matangi has also brought the verses alive by her melliflous singing and correct pronunciation of the words. Congratulations to you both and Jayaraman I am sure you will give us many more such compositions in the future.

All the best.
