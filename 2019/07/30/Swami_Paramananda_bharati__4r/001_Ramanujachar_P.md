I convey my deep condolences.

He was a great soul and moulded many people's careers spiritually.

Along with Prof KS Kannan, Prof Vineet Chaitanya, Prof KV Ramakrishnamacharyulu, I have had many useful interactions with him, ever since the 1st national seminar on 'Computers and Samskritam' he had organised in New Delhi in 1989.
