A tithi signifies an angular difference of 12 degrees between the sun and moon as seen from the earth.

  

The moon is some 385,000 km away and the sun is some150 million km away from the earth.

  

So the angular distance between these two would be the same from all points of earth in any given time; the distance between any two points earth being miniscule compared to the distances of these two heavenly bodies.

  

Please correct me if I am wrong.
