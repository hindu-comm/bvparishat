Dear Shri Sivasenani ji:  

  

Thanks for the short form answer which is less daunting than the long form one the Shri Anand ji unleashed on me :). I feel more competent dealing with the short form for now.

  

I understand (theoretically) the arunodaya/suryodaya issue along with difference in calculative models used.

However what I fail to understand is why the adhikaris have given instructions that are contrarian when applied to Vaishnavas and Smarthas. My understanding of ekadashi (do correct if wrong) is that toxins are generated in the body and hence ingestion is avoided afap. Also ekadashi was the day Halahala was generated during samudra manthan so that bit of esoterica as applied to personal practice I understand. Be that as it may, having two different times for this observance seems contrary to the motive of the dharma shastra which is to aid in deha and eventually chitta shuddhi.

It would therefore help a bit for me to understand why Shri Madhvacharya gave different directions for Vaishnavas and Smarthas. As a Siddha purusha who understood inner dynamics, he must have had valid reasons that went beyond mere nomenclature.

  

I hope I have expressed my doubt clearly.

Sometimes Smarthas celebrate the tithi of Janmashtami while some Vaishnavas wait for the Rohini nakshatra to rise. This I can understand.

  

Ekadashi which is a nitya upavasa for all, prescribing different days based on philosophical nomenclature is a bit problematic for my understanding.

  

Regards,

  

Venkat
