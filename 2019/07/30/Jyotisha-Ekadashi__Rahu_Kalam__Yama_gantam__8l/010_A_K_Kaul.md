Dear Shri Pandey ji,

Jai Shri Ram!

Tithi is the difference in ecliptic longitude I.e. the longitude of the moon minus sun divided by twelve.

When the moon is in conjunction with the sun, I.e. when the difference between the lunar and solar longitudes is zero, it is Amanta (New Moon) and when the moon is away by 180 degrees from the sun, it is Purnima ---- Full Moon.

Ecliptic longitudes are measured from the Vernal Equinox by all the observatories the world over.

These conjunctions and oppositions etc. are all symbolic and have nothingto do with their mutual distance. E.g., the sun is millions of times larger than the moon and away by hundreds of thousands of kilometers from the latter.

There can thus be no real "opposition" or conjunction etc. between the two. But irrespective of the same, it is pitch dark on an Amavasya and full "illumination" on a Full Moon!

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!

A K Kaul
