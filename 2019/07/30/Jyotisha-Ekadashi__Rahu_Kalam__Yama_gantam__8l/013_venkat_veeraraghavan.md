Dear Shri Anand ji-  

  

Thank you for your explanation.

  

I have just one doubt. You say Vaishnavas are more concerned with shuddha ekadashi rather than breaking fast on dwadashi.

The episode of Ambarisha a Vaishnava who got into trouble with Rshi Durvasas because of his necessity to do paraNa on dwadashi.

  

brāhmaṇātikrame doṣo  
dvādaśyāṁ yad apāraṇe  
yat kṛtvā sādhu me bhūyād  
adharmo vā na māṁ spṛśet  
ambhasā kevalenātha  
kariṣye vrata-pāraṇam  
āhur ab-bhakṣaṇaṁ viprā  
hy aśitaṁ nāśitaṁ ca tat  

  

The above passages show the necessity to break the fast on dvaadashi itself failing which the person accrues adharma.

Can you also comment on that please?

  

Thanks,

  

Venkat
