Dear Sri Venkat Veeraraghavan

  

To continue to use the short answer format, I don't know the answers to your questions.

  

Still if I write, it is to draw your attention to another difference. What happens when one has to perform a Sraddha on ekadasi. From where my ancestors came from (Guntur district of AP), apparently the Vaishnavas postponed the Sraddha whereas the Smarthas broke the ekadasi vrata of fasting but performed the Sraddha.

  

When it comes to these issues - drigganita (we at our home don't follow that), difference in tithis (either due to difference in calculation or interpretation) etc. - the practical solution is to follow achara.

  

Having said that, will one not consciously deviate from Achara? I, for one, will when I am convinced that the circumstances demand it. Now the circumstances could be personal or societal. By and large, I applied this discretion in the personal sphere. For questions which affect society as a whole, like whether we should shift celebration of makara Sankranti from Jan 14 to Dec 21, महाजनो येन गतः स पन्थाः।

  

Regards

Senani
