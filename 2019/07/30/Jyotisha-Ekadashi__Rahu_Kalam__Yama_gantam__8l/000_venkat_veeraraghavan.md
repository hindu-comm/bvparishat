Dear Vidvans,

  

1. Can you pls shed some light on Ekadashi calculations?  
  
Why is that the Vaishnava calendar and Madhva Gurukula's claendar always off by one-two days compared to conventional Panchanga?  
  
Since Ekadashi is a NItya Upavasa there shouldnt be discrepancies between Vaishnava Calendar and other calendars..  
  
  
We are just talking about phases of the moon relative to the lat/longitude of the place we are in right?  
  
Please clarify this for me.  
  
I have spoken to many but have been unable to get a satisfactory answer.  

  

2. How is Rahu Kalam / Yama gantam calculated? What activities is it good / bad for?

  

Please enlighten.

  

Kind Regards,

  

Venkat
