Dear Venkatji,

  

The rule for breaking the fast during dvadashi holds only when the Ekadashi fast is observed on a shuddha Ekadashi. If the Ekadashi is viddha, and if the fast is observed on dvadashi, it is possible the fast will be broken on the Trayodashi. This can happen for Vaishnavas, but not smArtas, who would fast even on a Viddha Ekadashi to avoid breaking the fast on a Trayodashi. Please see the examples in the linked articles sent earlier.

  

Anand
