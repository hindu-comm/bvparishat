Dear Shri Anand ji-

  

Thanks for the enlightening post.

I however have a some questions/ observations here-->

1\. What is the status of Brahmacharis wrt Ekadashi? (There is a prominent mention for Grihasthas and Sanyasins) ...Also what are the standards for fasting? I understand Nirjala is best, but in case of aggravated jatharaagni, can fruits and nuts be consumed ? What other activities are vidhi and nishedha as per shastra on Ekadashis?

  

2\. Drigganita as the observed movement should be pradhana since it reflects reality most accurately. It is also my understanding that bijas need to be added to traditional formulas in order to keep calculations in sync with drik data. Not doing so contributes to the discrepancy and the confusion.

  

3\. I understand Smartha and Vaishnava recommendations are different, but has any one looked into why they are divised in such a manner? As far as I understand, the fasting on Ekadashi has its basis in toxins being secreted in the system. There is also the concept of adharma taking refuge in bijas on that day ( is this an arthavada or something else?) hence the nishedha of grain and seeds.

Eitherway there has to be a uniform day on which all can fast. This is not like the celebration of Janmashtami where some celebrate by tithi and others by nakshatra.

  

Please elucidate.

  

Kind Regards,

  

Venkat
