``` Dear Sri Pradyumna Achar ji--> This is for you--> ```

``` QUOTE ```

``` Having described the dharma as dealt with in the parasharasmR^iti, mAdhavAchArya (now) proceeds with the determination of the (proper) time relating to practice of 
dharma. 
 
The kAlamAdhava contains a topic devoted to ekAdashI for those who live practising 
shrauta and smArta karmas and who have not been initiated into VaiShnavism as per the pAncharAtra or vaikhAnasa Agamas. 
अथ श्रौत-स्मार्त-पर्यवसितानां पञ्चरात्रादि-दीक्षारहितानमेकादशी निर्णीयते ।   
He mentions the significance of aruNodaya vedha for VaishNavas and sUryodaya vedha for smArtas.
 
अरुणोदयवेधस्य वैष्णवविषयत्वे व्यवस्थिते सत्युदयवेधः स्मार्तानुष्ठायिविषयत्वेन परिशिष्यते । अत एव स्मर्यते - 
अतिवेधा महावेधा ये वेधास्तिथिषु स्मृताः । सर्वेऽप्यवेधा विज्ञेया वेधः सूर्योदये मतः ॥
 
Vedha at aruNodaya (ie. dashamI tithi prevailing during aruNodaya - the period of 4 
ghaTikAs before sunrise) has been established for VaiShnavas. What remains is the 
sUryodayavedha for smArta practitioners. Therefore, the smriti says:
 
(For smArtas), the vedhas mentioned based on aruNodaya, such as ativedha, 
mahAvedha, etc.,  (are for VaiShNavas) and are not to be considered as vedhas 
(for smArtas). Vedha (for smArtas) is at sunrise.
