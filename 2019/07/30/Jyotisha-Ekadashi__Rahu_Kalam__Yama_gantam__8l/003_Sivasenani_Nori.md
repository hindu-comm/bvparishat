Dear Sri Venkat Veeraraghavan

  

Short answer: Check the ekadasi tithi nirnaya in Dharmasindhu or Nirnayasindhu. The difference occurs when there is vedha (for a shuddha ekadashi, there is no difference). In case of vedha, usually it is the latter day for Vaishnavas. For Vaishnavas, Arunodaya is important whereas for Smartas, Suryodaya is important.

  

Regards

N Siva Senani
