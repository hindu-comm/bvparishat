The dharmasindhu states, "aShTamavarShAdUrdhvam-ashItitamavarshaparyantam-ekAdashIvratAdhikAraH". Anyone from 8-80 years of age has adhikAra to follow Ekadashi vrata. If a person is strong enough, the vrata can be continued even beyond 80. Hence, brahmachAris too are included (unless, as in cases where the boy is less than 8 years old, vide garbhAShTame aShTame, etc).

Those who are considered "ashaktas" can eat once in the night (naktabhojana), or consume "haviShyAnna", fruits, sesame, milk, water, ghee, panchagavya, or just air. Please see dharmasindhu (first pariccheda) for details.

Ekadashi has been followed by two distinct groups traditionally - smArtas and vaiShNavas- and that is the source of variation in the Ekadashi date, apart from deshabheda and Panchangabheda. For Vaishnavas, the nonmixing of Ekadashi with Dashami is important, whereas for smArtas, the breaking of Ekadashi fast must happen on the dvAdashi, never the Trayodashi. If this means they will have to fast on a Dashami-mixed Ekadashi, they will do so. I have heard one reason for the smArta rule. There are, among smArtas, those who follow the Pradosha vrata (fast) on the Trayodashi. Hence, they would not be happy breaking the Ekadashi fast on a Trayodashi, after having fasted on a dvAdashi. Desha bheda is due to the difference in sunrise times from one place to another. Since Ekadashi vrata is based on the tithi at sunrise (or aruNodaya), it is possible that Ekadashi is on one date in one place and on another date in another place. Panchangabheda is the usage of different panchanga methods, such as sUrya siddhAnta and dRggaNita.
