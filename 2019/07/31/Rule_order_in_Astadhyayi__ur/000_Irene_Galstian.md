Well, the Praci-Jyoti saga didn't get me anywhere, the periodical is  
basically untraceable when it comes to recent works.  
Back to square one: where could I find review papers/bibliographies on  
what's been recently published on rule order in Astadhyayi? I mean  
works that Cardona's books don't cover. All pointers are very much  
appreciated.
