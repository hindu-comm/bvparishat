Felt ecstatic reading the detailed article on the greatness of Vyasatirtha , the desecration of whose Brindaavana was in news recently.

Grew up hearing legends about the great guru.

  

My birth place has hundreds of Hanuman temples pratishThaa at which is legendarily attributed to Pujya Sri Vyasa Tirtha. That place is just a sample of a huge geographical landscape throughout which such fond memories are part of repertoire of people's memories.
