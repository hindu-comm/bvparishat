Paturi ji,

  

I think the first book of this genre is 'Advaita Grantha Kosa' compiled by PN Pattabhirama Sastri, published in 1958.  

<https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.486354>

  

Though it is not as large as Thangaswami's work, it covers almost all the topics covered in the latter. On comparing the contents of both the works, I find that Thangaswami's book follows almost the same pattern as that of Advaita Grantha Kosa - A brief Summary of Advaita Vedanta and its history, Upanishat Prasthana, Gita Prasthana and Brahmasutra Prasthana followed by index of Advaita authors and Advaita works published and unpublished, and so on.

  

I find that the contribution of PN Pattabhirama Sastri in the bibliographical survey of Advaita Vedanta is not acknowledge anywheere by Thangaswami. Moreover, Dr. Kunjunni Raja who wrote foreword to Thangaswami's book considers it first of its kind. Were both Thangaswamy and Kunjunni Raja not aware of Advait Grantha Kosa? Or did they not consider it worthy of mention?

  

regards  
shankara
