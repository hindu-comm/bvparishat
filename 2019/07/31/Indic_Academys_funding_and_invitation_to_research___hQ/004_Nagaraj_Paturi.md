Respected Sri Subbu-ji,

  

There is no need of a separate persuasion.

  

It will certainly be accepted for a degree giving research work by any university.

  

Thanks for the suggestion.

  

We will send a request to the faculty and research course applicants/aspirants of various universities.

  

Warm regards,
