Sirs,

  

I have been requesting (since 1982) my teacher.friends in Sanskrit to give some small manuscript to their students for M.Phil. also,so that they can continue their studies for Ph.D.also on some rare and unpublished MSS Now,it seems some are subscribing to this view and getting their doctorate degrees on research work based on MSS. Let us hope,this trend continues and more Sanskrit scholars pay their attention to MSS. on scientific and technical literature in Sanskrit.

  

Fortunately,increasing number of swamis from Sampradayas like Jain,Swaminarayan,Iskcon etc ( who are expert in technical subjects like computer,engineering etc.) are now studying Sanskrit texts and contributing to this kind of research.Welcome to them.  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
