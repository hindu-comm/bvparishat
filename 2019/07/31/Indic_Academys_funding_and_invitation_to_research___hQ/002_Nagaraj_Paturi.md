You are welcome swamiji.

  

With regard to the difficulties in procuring manuscripts, we will try to help in all aspects where our network or other such potentials of us can help.

  

Some problems may have to do with personality aspects of the officers in charge there. We can only try persuasion and hope for the best.

  

Would you like to have a copy of Sri Tanha swami's book?

  

Or

  

You already have a book in mind?

  

I respectfully invite you to bring a paper to the conference.
