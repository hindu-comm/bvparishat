Sri Shankara-ji,

  

\> Were both Thangaswamy and Kunjunni Raja not aware of Advait Grantha Kosa? Or did they not consider it worthy of mention?

  

-- Thats a good question.

  

Your bringing into light the book Advaita Grantha Kosacompiled by PN Pattabhirama Sastri, published in 1958 is a very good contribution to the discussion.

  

I think it is a good idea for you to prepare a paper on the comparative study between the two books arguing Advaita Grantha Kosa could be have guided the compilation of Sri Thangaswami's book and present it at the conference

under the 10th theme.

  

With admiration and regards,

  

Nagaraj
