I'm interested in this part. What does it mean? Just writing some article about the unpublished advaita work or procuring, editing and publishing the same?

If last, then it's even better than first option.

One may face hurdles in procuring manuscripts, since some libraries have policy which make it difficult to get a digital copy in first place, and in some cases publication based on their manuscript is strictly not allowed. If someone can help in these matters too, it will be very nice.
