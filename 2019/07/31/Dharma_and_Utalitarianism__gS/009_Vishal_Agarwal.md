Please see attached a file that I use for teaching purposes.

  

Refer to item #4 on page 7 for directly answering your question, although the whole doc is relevant to your query. The doc has minor typos but you can catch them easily. Mahabharata references are to the Gita Press Edition.

  

Regards,

  

Vishal Agarwal
