Dear Sri Rishi-ji,

  

May I share with you that Idesigned and have been teaching a semester long course on Vedic Ethics to the PG students at MITSVS, Pune where we deal with the aspects of such conceptual comparisons between Vedic ideas and the western (or west-born contemporary mainstream academic ) ideas.

  

Short answer:

  

Utilitarianism as a school of Normative Ethics is a kind of Consequentialist Ethics contrasted with Deontological Ethics. Dharma has its Normative side but is not limited to Consequentialist understanding. It has its Deontological angle too.

  

Dharma is not limited to the Ethical sphere. It encompasses broader canvas. It has its ecological , nature implications and connects ethical discourse to ecological one , among other things.
