Haraye Namah

I just recently saw a Crash Course Video on Utalitarianism.

Is the Concept of Dharma and Utalitarianism the same thing?

Basically Utalitarianism talks of the greater good, killing of an Adharmi, when you have no other option is betterment to the society, such places Himsa is Dharma.

And laws are based on happiness. Like our sages define Dharma, as Sukhasya Mulam Dharmah. Yato Abhyudaya Nishreyasa Siddhih Sa Dharmah.  
So I find Utalitarianism also like a kind of system which supports the greater good of society. Helping others is much more important than self.
