Dear Shri Rishi ji-  
  
**"Utilitarianism**is a moral theory that advocates actions that promote overall happiness or pleasure and rejects actions that cause unhappiness or harm. A**utilitarian**philosophy, when directed to making social, economic, or political decisions, aims for the betterment of society."  
  
Superficially although dharma and Utilitarianism (Ufor short) seem to be the same, there is a crucial difference.

U seeks to analyse overall happiness / pleasure. Now what is the vantage point for making this assessment? If it is the individual that makes this decision, what are the checks and balances that decide the coverage/ width of this circle of virtue? What does it cover and what does it leave open?

  

Dharma on the other hand is defined as that which bears. "dharayet iti dharmaH"

It is literally that which bears and keeps us and society from falling. Although many have sought to define it as entelechy, it is still not as clear in scope and application as the first principles approach that Sanskrit grammar has for dharma.

  

While U is an Outside-in approach to deciding action, dharma is entirely inside-in.

  

Take the case of Sri Rama talking to Lakshmana when explaining His desire to go to the forest. He says Mother, father and Guru are at our disposal and need to be obeyed. God is not at our disposal etc.

In that very same epic Bharata disobeys his mother and refuses the kingdom.

So does this mean that Bharata acted against dharma (going by Sri Rama's statement?)

NO.

The marma here goes back to the definition of "Mother".

Kaikeyi's actions did not put her within that definition and hence Bharata's actions are justified.

The same also justifies Prahlada refusing his father's orders.

Rama plunged His family and His subjects into 14 years of misery in order to follow His father's word.

Where is the U here?

  

In actuality Sri Rama Himself did not obey the letter of his father's command since Dasharatha even asks Rama to depose him and sit on the throne. Sri Rama however knowing that His father's honour and dharma were at stake chose to save his father's word to Kaikeyi rather than obey his literal word.

  

In this context another shade comes to the meaning of dharma..protecting the dharma of another especially that of a superior is dharma.

Bharata by refusing the throne prevented the further digression of Kaikeyi into karmic "hell".

Often you will find here that the loci for personal action devolves upon an external source.

  

When Bhishma swore to make Krishna take up arms, Krishna preferred to let Bhishma's word come true than hold on to his own promise.

  

It takes a lot of Jnana, yoga and tapobala to truly understand dharma and karma even superficially.

  

Many would opine that Ravana stealing Sita and bringing the avalanche of destruction on his lineage was adharma .. or was it? If Ravana's visit to Svetadvipa and his desire to come back to his master (Vishnu) as granted by the boon of 3 asuric births as enemies of Vishnu were to fructify, Ravana alone knew the way.

Ravana shuts Malyavan up when M extolls Rama and yet he listens mesmerised when Hanuman speaks.

  

To perform even a fraction of the penance of Ravana requires extreme courage, sacrifice, ekagrata, control over the senses, dedication, and a sankalpa as deep as the oceans and as firm as the earth.

This is not the kind of person who falls into adharma on a whim.

  

Dharma is intricately woven with karma and as Krishna says:

"गहना कर्मणो गतिः".

  

Dharma is always followed yathashakti. We are not avatara purushas and hence have our own limitations to work with. We therefore understand the gold standard and try as best as we can to come close to it.

  

 

Kind Regards,

  

Venkat
