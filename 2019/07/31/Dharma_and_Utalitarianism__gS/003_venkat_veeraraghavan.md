Shri Harsha ji:

  

Thanks.

I just took a relook at:

"It takes a lot of Jnana, yoga and tapobala to truly understand dharma and karma even superficially."

  

And it seems a bit presumptuous on my part.

  

Just to clarify I dont have any knowledge of dharma or karma and whatever I write is based on watching the players in the two epics. I sometimes overextend myself in the hope that some learned person will correct me.

  

What can I add about karma that is not already there in the Bhagavat Gita?

Karma, akarma vikarma etc?

  

Kartum, akartum anyathakartum?

  

Krishna is the ultimate nayaka when it comes to mastery over karma and karmaphala.

Ambition is of atleast three types-->

1\. The ambition of sheer vanity driven by Rajas (Karna )

2\. The ambition of settled conviction driven by Satva (Arjuna)

3\. The ambition driven by Tamas (Jayadratha's penance towards Shiva in order to defeat the Pandavas)

  

Frankly as long as the end goal and process is tapascharya....I really dont care to grade these as uttama, madhyama adhama. It should be obvious to all.

The problem with karma is understanding context within a complicated multiperson 'game'.

This requires jnana born of both yogabala and tapobala --hopefully a portal is opened to give some context for action. Without a relevant context, action becomes meaningless.

  

If you look at football, there is karthum, akartum and anyathakartum....

when you get the ball, you pass it around (skill- kartum-adhibhautika), otherwise, you run around doing nothing (akartum) to where you think the ball will come....Jumping at the right moment sticking your leg/ head out to put the ball into the net when there are 10 variables around you coming to the right place at the right time is anyathakartum......this is not possible without tapasya(long hours of practice) and karmaphala through prior merit.

To do this consciously is the work of a superman like Krishna.

  

The rest of us even olympic and worldcup winners whing it...sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.
