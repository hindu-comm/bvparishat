Dear Venkatji and Nagarajji, I'm glad to be answered and apologize for the delay.

I couldnt completely assess your answer Nagarajji, but will Google the said terminologies to get a view.

Venkatji, I'd like to make a suggestion. Ram never asked Sita and Lakshman to come, he was only of the opinion to keep his father's word. Sita and Lakshman, held upto their Dharma, of going woth their husbands.

My current understanding is, that Dharma also is duty. Moral duty which isnt absolute, but relative followed by Vivek, where laws can be broken to support Virtue and the larger good.

Also, these laws are completely Vedic in nature, follow the teachings of the Vedas. Say, for eg, Matri Devo Bhava, Swadhyayan ma pramaditavyam, etc are for our well-being and are to be followed. Such type of respect to elders and teachers is unseen anywhere else. For that isn't prescribed there.

Should we accept the definition of Meemamsakas?  
Veda-pratipaditah Prayojanavad Artho Dharmah.

The prescribed through Vedas, which has a prayojana/purpose(drisht or adrisht), and is meaningful(desired/fruitful) is Dharma.

But, this gets limited to Yagadireva Dharmah. So there's some issue. Me being unfamiliar to Vedanta, but is there any Lakshana or definition given by Shankaracharya or Ramanujacharya etc about Dharma?
