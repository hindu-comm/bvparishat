Dear Roland,

Though I am no student of epigraphy, the arbitrary comments are unscientific.

Please do visit and convince yourself before using adjectives.

Some critical pattern recognition work is needed.  

To some India is a "pseudo" civilization, though they study it for some reason!

I have not fully understood various motivations in using "high priest" adjectives.

Regards,

Bm
