Roland,

You sound more like a lobbyist than a person of objective analysis.

We dismiss something after examination rather than hearing others.

Analysis and inference are not done by reading books but by direct

examination. Possibly you would let us have some further  

"further reading" to fit a viewpoint.

Being new to Indology, the approach saddens me. Hope it changes.  

Please ask Solomon to visit the site, and you should too.  

Best wishes,

Bijoy Misra
