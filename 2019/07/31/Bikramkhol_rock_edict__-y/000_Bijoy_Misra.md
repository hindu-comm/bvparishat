Dear friends,

  

Good morning. During my visit in India earlier this month, I did make efforts to

visit the rock edicts at Bikramkhol hidden in the jungles of western Odisha. I had  

heard about it but had not done my homework to focus on my journey. I was

dissuaded during an earlier trip in 2008 being told that the area was inaccessible

and could be dangerous. It was not.  

  

The site is reached via Jharsuguda, about 30 kilometers west going through the  

industrial town of Belpahar. We could reach Belpahar but there were no road signs

to the site. Fortunately two local residents were kind enough to escort us the ten  

kilometers ride into the dense natural teak forest. The narrow trekking path should be

navigable by an all-wheel drive vehicle without difficulty. We did manage to cover with  

a Suzuki, but had to be careful in negotiating the road erosion. Our escort friends  

traveled on a motor-bike.

  

Once we arrived at the site, I had the most gorgeous view of the old inscriptions engraved

on the magnificent rock overhang. The overhang is about a hundred feet wide and about  

forty feet high. Most likely the overhang was created by water erosion through the Mahanadi  

river which flows now a few kilometers away. The roof of the overhang extends about fifteen

feet creating a curved natural rock canvas.

  

The area rocks are laden with minerals which can be noticed through the colors in

the rock canvas and the sharp edges on the top and the sides. The inscriptions are in  

the middle fifteen feet which are almost plain. Unlike the other rock inscriptions of

Ashoka or Kharavela in Odisha, the Bikrakkhol inscriptions are carved at the direct

eye level.

  

The inscription consists of two rows of writings. The top row gives the impression  

of the line drawings of the Indus seals and the bottom row possibly gives some proto-oDiA  

epigraphy. One sees the top circular engravings but the etchings are degrading through

the weather.  

  

I am attaching a picture of the site below. It appeared to me that it could be the oldest

specimen of writing on rocks in the subcontinent. With the politics of debates on the

origin of scripts in the world, Bikramkhol could be a passport to discover the nature

and context of early writing.  

  

The local jungles are inhabited, though I did not make efforts to reach out to the people.

The locals do ascribe the site to religious sanctity and the local inhabitants do continue  

to offer coconuts and sacred lamps in honor of the inscription. The offerings may not be

helpful to protect the inscriptions.  

  

Through wikipaedia, I found that the historian K P Jaiswal did comment that the inscription could date to the Indus period. Through this note I wish to appeal to the authorities of

the ASI to provide immediate protection to the site. The site may lead to further excavation

in the area in locating new inscriptions on the habitation of people and culture in the area.

  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
