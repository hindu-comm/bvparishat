Respected Professor Bijoy ji,

Namaste ! Thank you for sharing your report on Bikramkhol. It's amazing.

I do agree with you that the ASI should take care of such precious places immediately. Some animal with script is a proof of antique. At the same time, as it is seen in the photograph, there is a carving of ओम् कार in a modern style ! It suggests that some common man might have shown his "over wisdom " !

Another sign of emergency is a lot of coconuts !!!

Regards,

Vasantkumar M Bhatt
