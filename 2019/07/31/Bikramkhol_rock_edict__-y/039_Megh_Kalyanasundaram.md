Thank you for all these useful links, Dr. Paturi-ji.

  

Dr. Bijoy Misra-ji,

  

It is perhaps hard (atleast for me) not to share yourskepticism about the completion of the task of putting in place, appropriate immediate
protection (in the shortest term) and a process for regular on-going maintenance (for the long term).

  

Unlike some other past grievances, where the expected result was achieved \[in one case, Centre for Policy Research retracted a video (from its Youtube channel) wherein the map of India appeared wrong vis-a-vis Kashmir\], this grievance, which is yet to be even closed (its "Current status" reads "Under process"), has (thus far and perhaps at best) yielded a responsive point-of-contact within the establishment, taking atleast part ownership.

I am not qualified to suggest what is the appropriate protection mechanism (or mechanisms, if more than one might be needed in the long term) but I do not see any reason for anyone not to write directly to [vnprab...@gov.in]() to either inquire or suggest.

  

Best,

Megh
