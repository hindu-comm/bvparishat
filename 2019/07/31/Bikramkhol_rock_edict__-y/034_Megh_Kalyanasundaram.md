Thank you Prof. Kannan, Irene, Manogna and Prof. Wakankar.

  

This grievance would not have happened but for Dr. Bijoy Misra raising the issue vide his note in BVP (after his visit to the site) and his subsequent inputs, in drafting the grievance.**Thank you** **Dr. Bijoy Misra.**

  

Manogna, very pertinent question that. With regard to your question, since the grievance has not yet been dismissed, a clarification (an option that exists in the system (as you are aware, from one of our joint grievances in the past)) has already been sought regarding specifics of "up-keep" and "prevention measures".

  

Irene, Wakankar-ji's offer is indeed wonderful and I see your point. I am hesitant, though, to reach out personally, right away, when there is a grievance thread still active, in which a clarification was raised only yesterday. This should, though, not stop anyone from using the grievance number, and the aforementioned context, to reach out.

  

Wakankar-ji, thank you for your thoughtful suggestion. Should there be an inordinate delay, in getting a response to the clarification raised yesterday, or closure without response to clarification sought, I will take you up on your suggestion.

  

Best,

Megh
