Dr Misra,

  

Grievances I have raised in the past have received responses. Some have been pertinent while a few have not. It is certainly worth having a documented trail though, as I see it.

  

To take things further and f it might be easier, could you mail [kalyanasun...@gmail.com]() any telephonic coordinate of yours and a date/time when you are free for a quick conversation. I am in a conference until IST 7 pm tomorrow (Aug 2) and can connect at a time of your convenience thereafter.

  

In haste,

Megh
