Dear Professor Misra,  
  
You're absolutely right to make a big deal of this. This is a HUGE  
matter. I hope relevant people hear your plea and do their duty to  
India.  
As for Pradhan, I'll try to make his introduction available tomorrow  
(the library is shut for the evening), and you'll see what approach he  
takes. The same Pradhan co-edited a 2 volume set on rock art of India,  
published in 2017:  
  
<https://www.exoticindiaart.com/book/details/rock-art-in-india-in-felicitation-of-prof-v-h-sonawane-set-of-2-volumes-NAR986/>  
  
That project started in 2007, but the publication was severely delayed  
for some reason. Still, I think you're right and it might be time  
better spent to get the names of prominent specialists in epigraphy  
and write to them directly.  
  
Best wishes,  
Irene
