Dear Irene,  

Pradhan may not say more than what Jaiswal has said (we should check)..

The immediate task is to protect and take a high resolution picture.

Somebody good in epigraphy should jump in to study.

Hopefully the ASI takes interest (i don't know why they have not!).  

They have a man posted for the site, but he lives ten miles away.  

The jungles could have wild animals.  

Scientific Carbon dating is a priority.
