Paturiji,

I think some chemical treatment was probably tried during the British time to help take pictures.

Jaiswals pictures were taken possibly after some treatment.

It is likely that the treatment has damaged the carving. It might still be active.

A good pressure wash with water would help. The rock is structured as an overhang, which might

have some engineering meaning. I have heard in a lecture by Prof ASshok Aklujkar that most of

the Ashoka inscripts are on cave walls or on ceilings. Bikramkhol appears peculiar to be directly

on the eye level and hence exposed to environment. It could then add history to its date.

Regards,

Bijoy Misra

  

PS. The audit report of 2013 does not mention Bikramkhol.
