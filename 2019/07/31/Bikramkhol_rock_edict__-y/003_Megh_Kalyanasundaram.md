Dr Misra,

  

Loved your report, particularly the picture. Thank you very much.

  

The thread <https://groups.google.com/d/msg/bvparishat/OO-4b0aEjDI/4TeLOx33BAAJ> includes a citation from Danino (2010) which refers to Jayaswal (1933). Reposting it here:

Jayaswal, who concluded in > 1933: “The Vikramkhol inscription supplies a link \[in\] the passage > of letter forms from the Mohenjodaro script to Brāhmi.’”
