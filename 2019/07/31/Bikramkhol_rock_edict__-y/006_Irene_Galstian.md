This book from 2001 seems to be relevant:  
  
<https://www.exoticindiaart.com/book/details/rock-art-in-orissa-IDD881/>  
  
I should be able to access the physical book, in case there is further  
interest from the list. Pradhan seems to be more of an archaeologist,  
I'm not sure how much attention he pays to the inscriptions.
