I don't think they have done anything. To cover the entire 100 feet by 20 feet wall by fibre-glass would be an effort.

Since these are edicts, any decay by water and air reduces the value.
Most of it is gone. They must immediately preserve,

but they may not know how to preserve since it is not an extremely specific work.  

So that somebody attending is not very useful information from the science point of view.

I happened to meet the State Minister of Culture in a meeting. He just listened.  

Possibly some private work might be attempted.

  

I have a question. Does anyone know of of any external shield to a monument to protect from air and water?
