Pranam Nityanand Ji,

  

I read both the article. Thank you very much for writing very good article. There are very less Hindus/Indians who go out of their comfort zone and follow Dharma.

Purpose of life has become just to take care of family only, and of time permit Hindus/Indians follow Dharma, but people like you are always stand up against enemies of India/Hindus.

Not only these, but many Indians/Hindus will not even support youin your battle against AntiHindus - AntiIndians.

  

Iappreciate you again for standing up for Hinduism.

  

Namaste & Gratitude,

  

Yogendra
