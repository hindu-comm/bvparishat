Dear list members  
  
A recently published article in The Caravan made the bizarre claims that Hindi delays understanding of social justice and is by default “casteist, racist and supremacist”. Similar claims have been made about Sanskrit before and now the same narrative is being made about Hindi

Here is my rebuttal, authored in both English and Hindi, of the above article in Swarajya  
  
English: <https://swarajyamag.com/ideas/hindi-hides-nothing-and-is-not-casteist-a-rebuttal>  
  
Hindi: <https://hindi.swarajyamag.com/ideas/hindi-hides-nothing-not-casteist-rebuttal/>  
  
As always, I welcome your feedback and comments.  
  
Thanks, Nityananda Misra
