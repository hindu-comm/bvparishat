Dear list,  
  
This item has been on my to-do list for a while, but conversations with librarians and random individuals haven’t so far resulted in progress. Hence the need to ask this list for help.  
The problem is this: Indian Sanskritists aren’t usually known in the West, unless they spent a portion of their career in the West. And yet extraordinary people have lived - and are living and working - quietly and tirelessly in service of Sanskrit, in India, writing up their findings in local journals, faculty publications and books printed in small numbers. WorkdCat doesn’t pick these up, but I’d like to know the scholars and their work, so please help by naming names and works. My main interests are Vedic Sanskrit, Paninian studies, and Vedic ritual, but as all is interconnected, no hard and fast boundaries are possible.  
  
A couple of more specific questions:  
What is known about Prof BM Chaturvedi? At one point he was the head of faculty at Delhi. And about Prof Madhusudan Misra?  
  
Thank you in advance for all leads, however brief. Sometimes a thin pamphlet is more insightful than a large ‘definitive’ monograph.  
  
Best wishes,  
Irene
