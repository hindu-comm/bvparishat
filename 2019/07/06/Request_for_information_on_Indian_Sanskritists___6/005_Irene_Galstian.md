Thank you for the RSS book, Dr Patel. I have it too, but librarians here had trouble locating works when given just the names of scholars. Is there a library catalog system that covers Indian libraries extensively? Maybe that’s what I ought to look for.

  

I have the Cardona book too, since it’s a key item for anyone who’s into Panini. But do you think that it picks up most of Indian contributions? That’s the key question. For mathematics, for example, there are Math Reviews. They aren’t perfect, but at least it’s a more or less centralised place to look up what’s been written in the various areas of mathematics. For Sanskrit I can’t find such a thing. WorldCat doesn’t contain very many libraries in India, so it’s possible that we in the West remain unaware of interesting developments. But is that true? That’s what I want to understand.

  

Or let’s put my query into another form. If I were located in India and wanted to get an detailed overview of the topics mentioned, how would I go about it?
