Dear Irene,

  

I have found<http://kobatirth.org/> and librarian there very helpful. They have good cataloguing system for Indologic stuff. Just to give you an example, they also do storage and retrieval of table of content and bibliography of each book and ToC of various magazines. So chances of finding an article from journal is quite high.

[koba...@gmail.com]()is their email id.
