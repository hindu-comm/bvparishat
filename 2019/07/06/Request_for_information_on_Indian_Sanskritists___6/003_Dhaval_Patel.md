For Paninian grammar scholars and their publications, following two books by George Cardona will be a good starting point

  

Panini - A survey of research, 1976

Recent research in Paninian studies, 1999.

  

This wil give you orientation to all scholars whose interest is in Paninian grammar, at least till 1999.
