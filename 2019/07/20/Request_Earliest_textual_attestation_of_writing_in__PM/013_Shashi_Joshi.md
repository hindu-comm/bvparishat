Madhusoodana ji,  
Thanks for the references from Ramayana.  
  
Sarga 128 YK. from <http://www.valmikiramayan.net/yuddha/sarga128/yuddha_128_frame.htm> --

  

shloka 108 - paThedyaH shR^iNuyaalloke naraH paapaatpramuchyate  
shloka 119 - shR^iNvataH paThataH sadA (both sources)  
--> Here paTha is used for recitation, not necessarily for reading.

  

  
shloka 122 - ye likhantiiha cha naraasteShaaM vaasastriviShTape \|  

--> Here I can't imagine any other interpretation of the word. But, this being the 3rd last or 2nd last shloka of the last kANDa of ramayana (bAla and uttara kANDa are considered later additions), is it possible this shloka may have been added much later.

  

Why am I skeptical? There seems to be no mention of writing within the Ramayana story. No one writes any letter. No king to king message. Hanuman takes the ring, not a letter. Angad and Hanuman don't read out a message from Rama to Ravana, like later on doota do in history.

As Valimiki is composing the chhandas, students learn them by heart and recite. Lava and Kusha are traditional 'singers'.  

  

Is it possible that Ramayana occurred at a time before script was popular? Inca had a prosperous civilization without a script, so it is not a precursor to progress. And, anyways, we had a strong oral tradition from long.

  

Once again, I simply state my curiosity, and seek feedback from the wise.

  

Thanks,  

\~ Shashi
