Sirs,

गीती...is from Paniniya Shiksha to the best of my knowledge. (Query of Sri V Subramanian refers)

  

As regards the query of Shashi Joshi, about reference to writing of Ramayana, kindly refer sarga 128 (the last sarga) of Yuddha Kanda.

It clearly mentions about reading ..in Shloka 108 and 119. What is written only can be read.

Shloka 122 clearly mentions लेखयन्तीह...
