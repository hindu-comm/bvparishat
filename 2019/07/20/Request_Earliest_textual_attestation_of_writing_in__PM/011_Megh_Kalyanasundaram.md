Namaste Shri Wakankar ji,

  

I managed to find the firstof two books you suggested:*Ganesh-Vidya The traditional Indian approach to Phonetic Writing*

  

The following excerpt (in bold below) from the section "*Textual References to Scriptology*" in *Ganesh-Vidya* was amongst other references I did not know of and I found interesting; thank you.

The "meaning" of this verse in the*Modern English Translation of The Rig Veda Samhitaa*(2014) Vol IV published by Bhavan's (attributed to Prasanna Chandra Gautam) is as follows:
