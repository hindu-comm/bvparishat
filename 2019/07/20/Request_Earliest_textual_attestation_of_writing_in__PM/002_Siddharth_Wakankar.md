You are requested to read a very good book written by my eldest brother, the late L. S. alias Lipikaar Bapu Wakankar. Its name is:

  

Ganesha-vidya- The Traditional Indian Approach to Phonetic Writing,Tata Press,Mumbai,1967.

  

It is based on the famous Ganesha Atharvasheersha.

  

His other book,viz. "Random Indological Thoughts" also contains references to writing culled from Rigveda onwards.
