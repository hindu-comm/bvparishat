Megh ji,

पठ also means recite aloud. To learn by repeating. It need not be attached to reading only.

  

Students were doing पठन even before they got hold of manuscripts, say in the time of Panini or Baudhayan, remember manuscripts were not as easily available as books and notebooks today. Only the senior most batch maybe having access to library :)  
  

  
Thanks,  
Shashi
