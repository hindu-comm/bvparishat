Very good question, something that I have had as well. Related points:

  

Is there any reference in Ramayana of any script/writing? Mahabharata has many, including Ganesha being the scribe.

  

Can likhitam in this atharvaved reference have any other meaning than writing? Like maybe, drawn? Surely, drawing is much older and different than writing.  
  

  
Thanks,  
Shashi
