Namaste Shashi Joshi ji,

  

Thank you for responding.If, and only if,****it is your position thatलिखित inअजैषं त्वा संलिखितमजैषमुत संरुधम् isnot writing but "drawn," may I request to know whether you take that position in the specific context in which it has been used in this verse? If yes, I would be very grateful if you would choose to share your reasoning, thank you. Also, are you, or is anyone else, aware of any other instance whereलिखित has been used in a sense that is,*without any doubt*, not writing but something else? In other words, what is the credible, independent (or context-dependent) rationale to justify the interpretationलिखित as something other than writing in this verse? Further, does its etymology support such an alternative interpretation?

  

Also, I hear you on your point aboutमहाभारत.Here, though, is a clear instance whereलिखित is interpreted as writing, by RP Kangle (in theअर्थशास्त्रं):

Beyond writing, there are not only "record-books" (as translated by Kangle again) but also a "Records office" alluded to intheअर्थशास्त्रं

Sincerely,

Megh
