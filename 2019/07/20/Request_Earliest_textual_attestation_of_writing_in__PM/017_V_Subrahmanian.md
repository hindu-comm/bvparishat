In the Brahma Sutra Bhashya 2.1.14, Shankaracharya makes an observation:तथा अकारादिसत्याक्षरप्रतिपत्तिर्दृष्टारेखानृताक्षरप्रतिपत्तेः । The universal letters/akshara/sound 'a', etc. are understood by the rekha, lines, that are not static/real universally.

  

Lines/curves are different across languages and even within one language, across times, but the sound/akshara those lines/curves signify do not change.

  

And in BSB 2.2.17 he makes another observation:यथा चैकापि सतीरेखास्थानान्यत्वेन निविशमाना एकदशशतसहस्रादिशब्दप्रत्ययभेदमनुभवति,
with reference to numerals.
