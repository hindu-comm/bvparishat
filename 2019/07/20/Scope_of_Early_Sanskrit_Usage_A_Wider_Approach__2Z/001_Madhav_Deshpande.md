Dear Warrier Ji,

  

  Thank you for your encouraging comments. As for the details fo the features of the home languages of the Vedic R̥ṣis and commoners, we can only make inferences based on indicators that I have cited. We don't have direct textual materials from these levels of language use. My point is that these levels did exist, and we can make some inferences about them, and their existence cannot be overlooked in a wider understanding of Sanskrit usage. With best regards,
