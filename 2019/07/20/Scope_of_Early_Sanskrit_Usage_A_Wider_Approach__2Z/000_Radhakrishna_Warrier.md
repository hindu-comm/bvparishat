Thank you Prof. Deshpande-ji for the link to your paper "S*cope of Early Sanskrit Usage : A Wider Approach*". It was quite an interesting read.  



"*Saktum iva titaunā punanto yatra dhīrā manasā vācam akrata* (Ṛgveda 10.71.2ab). 

When the Wise created language with the mind, as if winnowing barley with a sieve... "



Perhaps at the time of "winnowing and sieving", the selection of the subset was from a language spoken by all, elite and non-elite included.
This subset would have been easily intelligible to the non-elite of the time, just as modern day keertans in contemporary languages are easily understood by the masses.  In the course of time, as the mother tongues diverged from the source language of this standardized subset, it became less and less intelligible. 



In the Prakrits that I have been exposed to, Sanskrit conjunct letters seem to have been simplified beyond recognition as in 'hasta' (hand) becoming hattha (and eventually modern Indo-Aryan hāth), or sārdha (with half) becoming sāḍha (and then sā.ḍhe as insā.ḍhe cār, four and a half), or kvatha (concoction) changing to kaṭha, then kaḍha, and finally to kaḍhī (the

yummy curry, especially the sweet Gujarati variety).  When you mention dialects and "home language" of priests, do you mean a language that has undergone change of pronunciation to such an extent, as described above?
Or changes to a much smaller extent, comparable to the difference between say standard Hindi and its contemporary regional dialects?
