Sirs,

If you are very particular about Srimad Bhagavatam (in Kanndada) published under the aegis of Maharaja of Mysore, several decades ago, I have no clue.

But, it has been aptly translated in to Kannada and published by Bharatha Darshana Prakashana few decades back and they are available in market. They are also very good and useful.

Respectfully yours
