Sirs

More than 20 Puranas and Rig Veda with Sayana bhasya, published under the aegis of Maharaja of Mysore, are available in CD form. Scanning is very clear. CD is available at a very nominal price.

  

I have purchased the CD from

Vidya Ganapathi Prakashana

76, 3rd Block

Thyagaraja Nagar

Bangalore - 560 028

  

It is also available in Vedanta Book House, Bangalore.

  

Vidya Ganapathi Prakashana have also re-published some of the Puranas. I have purchased 25 volumes of Skanda Purana from them.

  

with regards

Mohan
