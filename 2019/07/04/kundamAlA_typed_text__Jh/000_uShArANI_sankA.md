सदसे नमः

A humble Namaskara to everyone.

  

I was searching for "kundamAlA" the dRSya kAvya by by DiGnAga, typed text in Devanagari or IAST (convertible, of course).

I tried with several parts from the text, in Google content search in vain.

  

Could the scholars help me find it, if it's available on net anywhere else ?

Just wanted to check before I would reach out for helping hands to prepare a text.

  

The scanned books are available here- (in case, interested to see or read)-
