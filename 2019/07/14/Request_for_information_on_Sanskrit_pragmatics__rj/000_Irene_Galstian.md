Dear list,  
  
There have been a number of threads here and elsewhere on the  
desirability of translating world classics into Sanskrit. The  
consensus in such threads usually converges to something like 'we  
should petition the government'. This is good, please don't get me  
wrong, but petitioning the government isn't the same as petitionining,  
say, Siva: in order for meaningful translations into the given  
language to be possible, there should be already present in that  
language various modes and registers of speech, so that the subtleties  
of the source language would have somewhere to 'land' on in the target  
language (Sanskrit in our case).  
Therefore, please point me to studies on Sanskrit pragmatics, since I  
would like to understand in more detail the practicalities of  
translating fiction into Sanskrit.  
  
Best wishes,  
Irene
