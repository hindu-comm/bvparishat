T49-4\* TATT jq4J II 'R II

Dear Biden's,

  

These are Sutra's from the Yoga Sutra's of Patanjali Pada III

  

27\. By making samyama on the sun, one gains knowledge

of the cosmic spaces.

  

28\. By making samyama on the moon, one gains knowledge

of the arrangement of the stars.

  

29\. By making samyama on the polestar, one gains know-

ledge of the motions of the stars.

  

It shows that knowledge is illumined through Samyama (Dhyana) and not through logic or observation as was the case with western thought.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
