Visited Alaska during the July 4th weak, and stepped into the “frigid” Arctic which was actually a sunny 23 °C at this time of the year. This journey brought to my mind another matter. Let me briefly dwell on that matter here.

Watching the midnight sun in Fairbanks, Alaska, and hearing about the 70-day continuous sunlight there, my thoughts went to Āryabhaṭa.

Āryabhaṭa said in his astronomical masterpiece Āryabhaṭīyaṃ:

रविवर्षार्धंदेवाः पश्यन्त्युदितंरविं तथा प्रेताः।

शशैमासार्धंपितरः शशैगाःकुदिनार्धमिह मनुजाः ॥

(Thanks Shri A K Kaul for forwarding this shloka to me.)

The gist of the Sanskrit verse is that it is half a year light and half a year night at the North and South Poles; half a lunar month (roughly 14 earth days) light and the other half night on the Moon; and half day sun and half day night “here “.

This is all correct, we now know. In the 5th century CE, Āryabhaṭa could not have travelled to the polar region or flown to the Moon. He could make these observations thanks only to his brilliant mathematical, astronomical and observational skills. To make these statements, not only did he need to know the details of the rotation and revolution of the earth and the moon, but also that the axis of rotation of the earth is tilted to cause the six-month day and six-month night at the poles.
Note that this was more than a thousand years before the times of Copernicus or Galileo both of whom were targets of the inquisition of the Church (Copernicus posthumously) for their scientific discoveries.
