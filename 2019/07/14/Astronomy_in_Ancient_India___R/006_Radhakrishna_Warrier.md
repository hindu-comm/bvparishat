"So how far were you from the Aleutian Islands ?"

  

Aleutian Islands are a long chain of islands extending into the ocean about 1200 miles (1900 km) from Alaska mainland.

  

Fairbanks is about 1250 miles (2000 km) from Cold Bay from where Aleutian Islands can be considered to begin. From there the islands extend 1200 miles in an arc into the Bering Sea which is a continuation of North Pacific Ocean.
