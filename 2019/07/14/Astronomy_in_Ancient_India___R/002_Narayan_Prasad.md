Thanks for sharing your experience.

So how far were you from the Aleutian Islands ?

While translating from Russian Radischev's "Journey from St. Petersburg to Moscow", I came across the mention of these islands.

BTW, the Aleutian Islandsbelong to both Alaska (USA) and Kamchatka Krai (Russia).

  

Regards

Narayan Prasad
