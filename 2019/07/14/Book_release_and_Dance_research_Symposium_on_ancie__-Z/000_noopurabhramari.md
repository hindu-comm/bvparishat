Theme - Dance in ancient texts

  

And release of

Sanskrit text based research publication on Nayika and Nayaka. - Nayikantaranga

  

Dr Dwaritha Viswanatha's Nāyikāntaraṅga published by Noopura Bhramari Publication will be released on the 21st of July. It is a special study on aṣṭanāyikas where a detailed analysis of many primary Sanskrit texts has been done for every nāyikā and the best definition has been identified. The popular misconceptions attached to these nāyikās have been broken along with analysing their varieties and sub varieties. Their activities are enumerated and apt examples have been incorporated regarding how these nāyikās can be portrayed on stage. Padams and Javalis have been quoted wherever necessary and a detailed exposition about the suitable āhārya is also mentioned so that it is easier for the dancers to relate to. It is a deep insight on nāyikās with a practical touch of adapting it to dance. It is built on a set of propositions that don't just reaffirm what is already known, but also opens the door to ideas that are yet to be encountered.

We fondly hope our effort will be well received by the warm and zealous response of our esteemed readers.

  

This book is useful for all dancers. This book could work as a handy guide for teachers, researchers and students of dance. Apart from dancers, people pursuing theatrical studies, film studies will also be benefited. People interested in kavya and kavya shastra will also find content that could enrich them.

  

For detailed invite please go through the invite pages.

  

Awaiting thw gracious presence of scholars.
