I received an official answer from the Royal Dutch Academy about the pdf of my Gonda Lecture: "The pdf of the Lecture will be available on our website from 22 November 2019. During that day the 27^(th)Gonda Lecture will be held and Wout will present the printed version of the 26^(th)Gonda Lecture to all the participants." Once the pdf is uploaded on their website, I will send another announcement. Best regards,
