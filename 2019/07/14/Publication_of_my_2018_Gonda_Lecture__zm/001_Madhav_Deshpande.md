Dear Megh Ji,

  

  Thanks for letting me know the difficulties. I also searched the website ([www.knaw.nl](http://www.knaw.nl/)) and have not yet located my publication. I received the printed copies today, and the printed copy directs one to this website for a pdf. It is possible that they have not yet uploaded the pdf on their website. I just saw the letter that came with the printed copies and it says: "We will start to distribute them on 22 November 2019 (the day of the 27th Gonda Lecture." So it seems possible that the pdf of my lecture will show up on that date.
Thanks for your patience. Will keep you posted.
