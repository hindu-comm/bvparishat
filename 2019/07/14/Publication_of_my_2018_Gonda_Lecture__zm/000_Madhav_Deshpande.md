I am pleased to announce the publication of the 26th J. Gonda Lecture that I delivered in 2018: "From Pāṇini to Patañjali and Beyond - Development of Religious Motifs in Sanskrit Grammar."

  

The pdf of this publication is available on the following website:

[www.knaw.nl](http://www.knaw.nl)

  

I have not tried downloading it, but this is what the published version says. Let me know if there are any issues with downloading.

  

With bestregards,
