Dear Sir,

  

It would be a good idea if the author gets this book published through a publisher in India and thereby make the book more affordable to Indian readers. The contents of the book are very valuable for Indians and hence this suggestion. If the author could be conveyed this, that would go a long way in making his book reach more readers.

  

Thanks and regards
