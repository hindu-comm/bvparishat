Dear Ashok,

  

  I checked the Prastāvanā Khaṇḍa of the Marathi TR of the Mahābhāṣya. On p. 71, under the title Prastāvanā, it says: कै. म. म. वासुदेवशास्त्री अभ्यंकर यांनी लिहिलेली. The rest of the volume is called Upodghāta, and is written by his son Kashinath Shastri Abhyankar. The history of the family and traditions in Kashi and Pune etc. is titled Bhūmikā, and it is written by Kashinath Shastri Abhyankar.
