Namaste Professor Deshpande

  

Have you read 'Adventures of a Brahmin Priest' by Vishnubhat Godse, Oxford University Press? It is on the 1857 rebellion and War of Independence. Translated from original Marathi Mazha Pravas by Priya Adarkar and Shanta Gokhale.

  

Kindly give your opinion and review if possible.
