Thanks, Irene, for sharing these documents. Professor Ravishankar is a long time friend of mine since his years at the College of Engineering in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and I had the opportunity of reading the manuscript prior to its publication. On page after page of the book, the notes of the translator show how much intensive and extensive historical work the translator has done. I hope the book receives due attention and recognition from scholars.
