Dear Murthy Ji,

  

  I have a copy of the original Marathi book and have read it multiple times, most recently as part of our bookclub reading here in San Jose in California. I have not read the translation. Will look for it. There are several such materials in Marathi that need attention, the most significant being MM Vasudeva Shastri Abhyankar's Introductory Volume to his complete Marathi translation of the Mahābhāṣya. Here one gets an account of the Abhyankar family, where the ultimate academic connection goes back to the great Nāgeśabhaṭṭa. The other important book is the history of the Vedaśāstrottejak Sabha in Pune. Then there is a booklet by N.C. Kelkar on the revival of Sanskrit Studies titled संस्कृत विद्येचे पुनरुज्जीवन. If one looks closely at the local language publications, one can find a lot of material in different parts of India. I have published an extensive account of the transition from Pandit to Professor in the region of Maharashtra. With best regards,
