Dear Vidvans,

  

Is there a reliable source on the names of the 7 dvipas / continents?

And can someone kindly name the 7 dvipas along with their modern names?

  

And in the absence of the pauranic name of a modern city like say Melbourne how would you include the name in a sankalpa?

  

Thanks,

  

Kind Regards,

  

Venkat
