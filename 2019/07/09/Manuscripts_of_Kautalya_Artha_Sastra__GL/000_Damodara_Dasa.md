Hare Krishna.

  

Respected Vidvaj-janas,

  

I am curious to know about Kautiliya (or Kautalya) Artha Sastra as we have it now in book form. When and from which places old manuscripts of it were discovered? Or is it a scripture being taught in parampara system from time unknown?

  

As far as I could understand, the first manuscripts of it were found somewhere in Karnataka by Shamashastry (but I may be completely wrong). In this case also I would like to know whether more manuscripts of this great scripture exist at different libraries?

  

Thankyou,

Hari Guru Vaisnava das,

damodara das
