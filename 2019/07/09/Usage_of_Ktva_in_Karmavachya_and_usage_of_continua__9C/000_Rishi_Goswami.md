ShreeHarih.  
  
I feel the need to find many popular and important usages in Sanskrit, many of which I found through self study and many which I learnt. Some of them I have made a way on my own, which works aptly.  
  
But I'm finding it difficult to use much of the language without popular usages.  
  
One of them is the usage of Ktva in Karmavachya. Is it possible or no, is my question.  
  
Like in Hindi we can say,  
  
"Aap kitne sundar dikh rahe hain."  
  
Same in Sanskrit: "bhavAn kiyatsundaram drishyate."  
  
But the same using Ktva.  
  
"Aap itne sundar dikhkar mere man ko har lete ho."  
  
"Bhavaan iyat-sundaram drishtvā (drishto bhootva) man-mano harati."  
  
(Is this right?)  
  
Drishtvā is Dekhkar, (after seeing) and Dikhkar (after being seen).  
  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
  
Same with Pach Dhatu.  
  
  
"Thodi der daal pakkar peeli ho jaayegi."  
  
"Kinchit-kaalam yaavat supam paktva (pakvam bhootva) paityam yAsyati."  
  
Now, I'm unsure if we can use Ktva in Karmavachya. But if not, can we start using it now? For Saukarya?

Now another issue is about Continuation.  
  
He continued to eat.  
Wo Khata Raha.  
  
How do you express continuation in Sanskrit?  
I don't even know the wordfor continuation.  
  
Spanish uses an idiomatic usage "Seguir" this root is used for following. Also in continuation. I'm learning Spanish and came across this sentence "Él Seguió a comer".  
  
He followed (Seguió) to eat, but it doesn't mean follow here. We can coin some Lakshanika usagw, or someone who's well versed in Sahitya here, can please let me know about it.  
  
Namaskar \_/\\\_
