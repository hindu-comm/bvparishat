This is a report about the Central HR Dept. initiating steps to make Sanskrit the spoken language of a whole village. In the first phase, a Central Sanskrit University has adopted five villages all over the country for this initiative. The one in Karnataka is 'Chittebaylu' in Shimoga Dist. This is close to the already famous 'Sanskrit Village' Mattur. Two more Central Sanskrit Universities also will be similarly adopting five villages each for this initiative.
