Namaste,

  

In 2015, Sri TB Lakshmana Rao of Bangalore brought out a book in Kannada, Bhaktisudhavarshini, moola in Kannada script and Kannada translation. I quoted from that book. I also have Vani Vilasa edition, Stotrani, in Devanagari script, containing many of the compositions of Jagadguru Sri Chandrashekhara Bharati Mahaswami, but this particular composition is not there.

  

regards.......yoga
