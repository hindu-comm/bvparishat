It is not clear for me. But can be guessed as आकाशस्य विद्विट् कटिः यस्याः सा as बहुव्रीहि compound meaning the one having waist evemy of (competing with) the sky. With totally slim waist is the common description of waist of women. विद्विट् means enemy and आकाश is used to exagerate the thin space pointing to nil or zero.

  

This is what I can explain.
