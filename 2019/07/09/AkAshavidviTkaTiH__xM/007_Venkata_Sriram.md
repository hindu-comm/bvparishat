Though, as perसामुद्रिकलक्षणं, the meaning goes as 'slender-waist' but When it comes to mantra-shastra, the wordतनुमध्या

implies theशडक्षरपाद गायत्री वृत्ति which has 2गुरु on either sides with 2लघु in between.

  

This 2 लघु is contemplated as 'slender waist' in tantra shastra where the 2 गुरु on either sides are said to be trunk & lower portions.

  

So, तनुमध्या is a pointer towards thisषडक्षरपाद गायत्री वृत्ति.

  

This was told to me by my teacher.
