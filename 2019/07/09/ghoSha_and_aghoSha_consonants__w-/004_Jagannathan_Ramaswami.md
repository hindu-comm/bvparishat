The phonetic explanation is that the vocal chords vibrate while voiced (ghosh) consonants are pronounced and there is no accompanying vibration in the pronunciation of voiceless (aghosh) consonants. Sanskrit has codified these sounds and placed them in a proper order. While many languages treat the distinction as phonemic, some languages do not take the vibration to be functionally relevant. So, a speaker of that language may pronounce the consonant in the same word as /p/ sometimes, or may sound as /b/ or, quite often, have a partially voiced labial. Languages like Tamil the distinction is subsumedunder their phonemic system - /b/ in post-nasal position (tambi) and /p/ in a word-initial position (pa:l) or as a geminate (appa:). As they constitute a single phoneme. the graph (letter) is the same. So, the orthographic system and the arrangement of the alphabet are conscious choices made by the grammarians of the language based on the systemic properties of the language and functional relevance of the elements therein. Roman and Arabic alphabets have a rather random order of the characters and presumably have no specific reason to repent.
