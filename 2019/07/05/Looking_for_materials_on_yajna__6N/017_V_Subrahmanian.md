We can show a yajna-cloud-rain connection from the famous belief that when Indra is propitiated by yajna-s, he blesses the yaajnika-s with rain. This was demonstrated in the Govardhana giri episode. The time-tested practice of propitiating Indra through the offerings was now changed at Krishna's instance, by offering them to the mountain and this brought furious rains from Indra.

There is also this Manu smriti cited in the Shaankara Bhashya for the Bh.Gita 3.14:

  

अन्नाद्भवन्तिभूतानिपर्जन्यादन्नसम्भवः।  

यज्ञाद्भवतिपर्जन्योयज्ञःकर्मसमुद्भवः॥ १४ ॥  

  

यज्ञात्भवतिपर्जन्यः,‘अग्नौप्रास्ताहुतिःसम्यगादित्यमुपतिष्ठते।*आदित्याज्जायते**वृष्टि*र्वृष्टेरन्नंततःप्रजाः’ (मनु. ३। ७६)इतिस्मृतेः।यज्ञःअपूर्वम्।

  

That 'Aditya' is said to cause rain is significant.
