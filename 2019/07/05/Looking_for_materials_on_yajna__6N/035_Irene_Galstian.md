I apologise for intruding into the discussion, and I'll try to keep it brief.  
I understand your concern with scientific rigour and preserving the  
logical chains of reasoning, but I'd also like to submit to you that  
when an extremely nontrivial result is being proved in modern  
mathematics, for example, these logical chains become subtle indeed,  
shall we say. Consider how the Weil Conectures were proved using  
Grothendieck's machinery, and you'll see firsthand that logical chains  
only \*seem\* secure. Now, is algebraic geometry not a science? Most  
think it is. But you'll find plenty of ambiguity, right there in the  
proof of a result that's considered proved and true.  
The comfort of words like 'foundations', 'known', 'proved' lasts as  
long as you're not up against a proof so intricate that it needs all  
the capacities of the available intellecual machinery, as was the case  
with these conjectures. 'Comfort notions', some of which I've listed  
above, are paraded in front of awestruck undergrads, but that's  
marketing at work. Eventually these notions dissolve, as all notions  
must.
