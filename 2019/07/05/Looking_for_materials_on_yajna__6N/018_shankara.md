Subbuji,

  

Glad to see the quote from Manu. Vachaspatyam wrongly attributes Gita verse to Manu, under the entry 'parjanya'.

"यज्ञाद्भवति पर्जन्यः" इति मनुः।  
  

I could not find this anywhere in the Manusmriti. The Sankarabhashya you quoted makes it clear that the attribution ofयज्ञाद्भवति पर्जन्यः to Manu in Vachaspatyam is wrong. It seems even Vachaspatyam is not free from errors.  

  

regards  
shankara
