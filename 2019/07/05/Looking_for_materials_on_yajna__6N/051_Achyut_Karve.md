Dear Vidwans,

  

What constitutes the Scientific method from the Indian point of view?

  

The Indian Scientific method is based on the practice of Yoga. One can refer to Sutra's 5 to 11 Pada 1 of the Yoga Sutra's of Patanjali. Here the word klishta and Aklishta are important. 

  

The scientific method in case of physical sciences is different than the Scientific Method used in social sciences.

  

I would like to ask what is the method that Social Scientists in the west use today? Has it been codified? 



  

The method used by Patanjali in his Mahabhashya is by dwelling on the Sutra's of the Ashtadhyayi and present cases which are true positive,
false positive, true negative and false negative. This is the modern system that is used in sciences where the truth needs to be arrived through statistical methods.

  

Lastly has the West through all its scientific endeavour over the past few centuries been in a position to arrive at the truth!

  

Indians used direct perception as the means through the practice of yoga.  

These are Sutra's from the Yoga Sutra's of Patanjali Pada III

  

27\. By making samyama on the sun, one gains knowledge

of the cosmic spaces.

  

28\. By making samyama on the moon, one gains knowledge

of the arrangement of the stars.

  

29\. By making samyama on the polestar, one gains know-

ledge of the motions of the stars.

  

It shows that knowledge is illumined through Samyama (Dhyana) and not through logic or observation as was the case with western thought.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
