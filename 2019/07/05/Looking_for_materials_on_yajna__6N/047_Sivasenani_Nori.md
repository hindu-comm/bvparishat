Sir

  

While I am thankful to Sri Venkat Veeraraghavan for printing out my correct name, it is quite okay. Happens with unfamiliar names. And I am not a professor; only a Dr.

  

Regarding the res, I wish to point out that we need to keep in mind what is mukhya and gauNa in Vedas and Angas. The main objective of Veda is to teach about Brahman (jnaanakaanda) and Yajna/Dharma (karmakaanda), everything else like description of the order of creation etc. is gauNa. In the case of Angas, the subject of each Sastra is clearly defined and any spillover is incidental; the spilt-over matter cannot be taken as the complete treatment of that topic.

  

So, if we should not search for science in Vedas it is because they are the wrong texts for that, like searching for calculus in Economics.

  

Regards

Senani
