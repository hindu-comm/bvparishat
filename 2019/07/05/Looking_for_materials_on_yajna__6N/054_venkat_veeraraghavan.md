Dear Shri GSS Murthy ji-

  

Given your zeal for math you might find the following instructive-

<http://www.pas.rochester.edu/~rajeev/papers/canisiustalks.pdf>

  

The main thrust of your question has already been answered in full by Shri Nori, so I will avoid repetition.

  

Your comments on whether ancient Indians were responsible for anything more than pulleys and the bullock cart and demands for modern mathematical rigour within ancient ritualistic texts betrays a lack of appreciation for TEXTUAL CONTEXT and recent subcontinental history (1000 years of Muslim rule with the attendant mass killing of Brahmins, burning of manuscripts and libraries, 250 years of British rule, 70+ years of left liberal communist rule). Do you even know what percentage of existing manuscripts have been digitised and made indexable?

If I write a book on ritualism, I am NOT going to bore my reader with proofs of formulae to satisfy the whimsy of some reader in the vague future looking for validation out of context.

  

Shri Korada has clearly mentioned in several writings that what exists in the name of Veda at present is a fraction of what used to exist before as pieced from existing knowledge.

Add to this the fact that many rshis who maintained ashramas were householders who researched and achieved feats well beyond what modern science is capable of today.

  

Your polemics about "knowing which nothing else need be known" is rather unwarranted given the fact that you probably do not have any ritualistic knowledge or indeed experience of how knowledge was obtained in the traditional Indian system.

In addition to your earlier ones you will also have to ask the following questions:

1\. How did the Rshis know that the Arundhati star was part of a dual star system when they did not have even a rudimentary telescope ?

2\. Why is it that much of modern plastic surgery is sourced from Sushruta and that the method of rhinoplasty is almost similar to Sushruta's after all these years?

3\. How is it that a backward race playing with sticks stones and pulleys have written books about TIME DILATION atleast about 5000 years (as estimated by western and eastern indologists) predating Poincare and Einstein?

4\. Rasashastra or Indian Alchemy is unique in terms of treatment and utilisation of Mercury and other compounds.

5\. The Navapashana statue of Murugan in Palani is an alchemical wonder that no one has been able to replicate so far.

6\. The purification of Zinc was passed on from India to China to the rest of the world.

7\. The decimal system is very conveniently called Arabic numerals now..

8\. Vaimanika shastra and vimanas mentioned in shastras did not have their basis in people given to day dreaming.

  

This list will be too long and will outlive my patience and yours, so I will stop here.

  

My point in listing the above is very simple:

1\. Any one of those achievements could be dismissed as a cosmic fluke, but not all.

2\. Assuming this is not some fluke, this would not have been possible without rigorous quantitative methods with attendant proof.

  

The only question is whether the proof is in existing knowledge or unindexed manuscripts or has been destroyed along with that lineage.

  

To give you some perspective on what happened in India over the last 1000 years, it will take the destruction of just 1000 scientists and technologists to take USA back to the great depression of 1929 and worse. It is this intellectual minority that supports the lifestyle of the majority. Having a smartphone at hand does make either of us smart in any sense of the word.

Imagine if you can what the systematic destruction of 1000 lineages of knowledge holders running in millions can do to a country. Do you even know what the percentage of Brahmins is in India now?

  

Kind Regards,
