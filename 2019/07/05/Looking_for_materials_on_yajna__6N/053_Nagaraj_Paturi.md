Sri G S S Murthy-ji,

  

In support of your proposition that the Vedas and Sanskrit do not contain any hidden treasures of Science and Technology, you mentioned in your post below that ancient Sanskrit writings do have Pythagoras Theorem /Formula and formula of Fibonacci sequence but do not provide derivations and/or proofs of these. So your idea seems to be that Science is not in the form of formulas or theorems (or laws or principles etc.) but it is in the form of derivations and / or proofs. Or, in other words, discovering or finding the rules, formulas, principles, theorems, laws etc. of nature or reality is not Science. Knowing or providing derivations or proofs for these rules, formulas, principles, theorems, laws etc. is Science. Since the ancient Sanskrit works do not contain derivations or proofs what is contained in the ancient Sanskrit works is not Science.

  

Incidentally when this post of you arrived here in the list I was immersed as audience to a huge Vaakyaartha Sadas which is an activity of just proofs and proofs alone. Every Vaakyaartha by a scholar ends in "hence proved" . These henceproveds are done not in one Shaastra but multiple Shaastras. The methods of proofs are highly variegated varying from Shaastra to Shaastra.

  

Euclid's "Elements" has been viewed more as a book of Logic than as a book of Mathematics. Its Mathematics is viewed as contained in its theorems. The proofs in it have been viewed as containing Logic. Of course the Logic in it is specific to the discipline of Mathematics, for that matter to the branch of Mathematics that it was covering. The Logic contained in those proofs is comparable to the Logic contained in the proofs in various Shaastras. The methods of proof being different from the Logic in "Elements" is because of the aspect of reality focused in those Shaastras.

  

It is reasonable to get surprised about why the same society which had such advanced system of proofs did not document the methods in the case of the Mathematical discoveries, findings and /or propositions it arrived at and articulated. But it is not reasonable to suspect " lack of proof" or "secrecy" or intentions

" to exhibit wizardry" etc. The most unreasonable is to conclude on this basis that there is no Science in ancient Sanskrit texts. Sir, Science is fundamentally contained in the rules, formulas, principles, theorems, laws etc. discovered and only secondarily in the articulation of or documentation of derivations and/or proofs. The validity of a rule,, formula, principle, theorem, law etc for which proof is provided in one of the systems, here the Greek system , does not get countered or nullified because such a proof has not been articulated or documented in another system, here the system in the ancient Sanskrit texts.

Your "wooden plow, the bullock cart and the pulley for drawing water" question is related to Technology and more specifically to the issue of relation between Science and Technology. That is for another post some other time.
