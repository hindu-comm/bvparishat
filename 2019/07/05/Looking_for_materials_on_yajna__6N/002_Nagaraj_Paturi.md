Dear Sri Krishna Kashyap-ji,

  

Sharing a document with the diagram I created to explain the cyclic view in

  

अन्नाद्भवन्ति भूतानि पर्जन्यादन्नसम्भवः \|

यज्ञाद्भवति पर्जन्यो यज्ञः कर्मसमुद्भवः \|\|३- १४\|\|

कर्म ब्रह्मोद्भवं विद्धि ब्रह्माक्षरसमुद्भवम् \|

तस्मात्सर्वगतं ब्रह्म नित्यं यज्ञे प्रतिष्ठितम् \|\|३- १५\|\|

एवं प्रवर्तितं चक्रं नानुवर्तयतीह यः \|

अघायुरिन्द्रियारामो मोघं पार्थ स जीवति \|\|३- १६\|\|

1\. Do yajnas form clouds ?

  

is one question

  

2\. Are clouds formed only by yajnas?

  

is another question.

  

3\. Are all activities/events leading to the formation of clouds called yajnas ?

  

is yet another question.

  

For question #1 above, answer is yes, Yajnas can form clouds.

  

For #2 above, the answer is no, many other smoke generating activities can form clouds.

  

Acid rains are result of a certain kind of cloud forming activities only.

  

There were ash rains during gulf war.

  

So yajnas are one of those which can form clouds.

  

May be the idea is that yajnas form healthy clouds, that rain healthy stuff, unlike those activities which lead to acid rains.

  

Or, we can say that yajnas generate anna generating, or fertilizing clouds. Or we can even say that if a cloud forming activity is not generate fertilizing clouds , it can not be called yajna. If a cloud forming activity leads to harmful consequences such as acid rains, it is the opposite of yajna.

  

So to #3 above , the answer is , no, not all activities leading to the formation of clouds can be called yajnas.

  

All actions are not karma here. Only those actions which form part of a cloud forming activity that can lead to fertilizing rains is karma here.

  

That is why , in the 8th chapter, we have

  

भूतभावोद्भवकरो विसर्गः कर्मसंज्ञितः ॥ ८-३॥

  

karma that is Bramhodbhavam = Veda-motivated can only beभूतभावोद्भवकरो विसर्गः.
