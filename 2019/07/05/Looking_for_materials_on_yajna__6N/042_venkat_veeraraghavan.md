Dear Shri Murthy garu,

  

The gentleman's name is 'Nori' not 'Noori'. Constant misspelling of a person's name can be construed offensive and deliberate.

  

Shri Paturi-garu and Sri Murthy garu:

  

Simply put, science is a model used to understand observed reality. The scientific method is merely a process using empirical methods and a constant feedback loop to ensure that the model is a more honest representation of observed reality,

Now let us test the limits of this new age 'holy cow' -- the scientific method.

I use the word observed reality because when the world is examined through the eyes and then observed through an electron microscope the laws and equations change completely.

There is no need to go into higher math to prove this.

There are a ton of results based on triangles. All these results will break down if the basic assumption of 2D space is negated.

All force equations in mechanics are based on ignoring friction between surfaces and air resistance.

  

Veda is living knowledge that faithfully represents reality in all its aspects- Absolute(Nirvikalpa), relative (Savikalpa), subjective etc.

Many of the formulas etc given in the sulba sutras etc were meant to support performance of ritual and design of Yajnashalas rather than as a basis for indulging in airy intellectual narcissism and navel gazing. Given that over the last 1000 years alone many living traditions have been massacred by ravaging armies and many libraries have been burnt to ash, and given that many modern Indian indologists and stakeholders these days seem more interested in reading what some outsider has to say about the living tradiiton instead of going to the custodians themselves, what hope do we have of coming any closer to a real understanding of our own tradiitons?

  

Add to this the problem of transplantation of wrong semantics and there is a recipe for raita. Instead of using the shabda kalpadruma or Vachaspatyam or rules of Shiksha pertaining to the shakha for guide, when words are used interchangeably confusion is compounded.

  

Let me give a basic example: Many for the ease of explanation translate svaraksharas as vowels.

It is said that when a vowel sound is produced, the degree of stricure that is postion of the active articulators in relation with the passive (fixed) articulators remains unchanged. It happens with अ इ उ etc but not with ऋ....so do we next demote ऋ and declare it to be a consonant and not a vowel because it does not comply with the modern linguistic definition of a vowel? To do so however would be to miss the fact that ऋ is a svaraakshara and NOT a vowel as described in some linguistic definition.

Keep your definitions LOCAL and ask traditionalists and ritualists for explanation and not outsiders.



Given the above, it is the MODEL that needs to fit reality and NOT the other way around.

  

Kindly get the opinion of Shri Korada Garu and others like him.

  

Regards,

  

Venkat
