some of my observations:

  

1\) Yajna has deeper significance beyond just: fire sacrifice with mantras

  

yajna even in the context of Gita is not just restricted to : offerings to Agni using "Havis" and mantras.

  

these shlokas confirm them:

It is noted in this above shloka that "jnAna yajna is superior to dravya maya yajna".

In MahAnArAyanIya, the yajna of a jnAni need not involve a fire sacrifice,•In other words, the Self is the dikshita ; faith is the wife; the body is the fuel ; the heart is the post ; kama is the offering and anger is the animal offered etc. All things belonging to the sacrificer are for the sake of the sacrifice : as are all actions towards the same goal.

2\) Justifying yajnAt bhavati parjanyaha only based on "fire sacrifices" can be justified only using the verse

![image.png](https://groups.google.com/group/bvparishat/attach/6af0de208473c/image.png?part=0.8&view=1)  

  

since gandharvas, devatas etc. could be doing yajnas, even if human beings stop yajnas or were not there to do yajnas, still life will be supported by the yajnas done by other beings.

  

Someone told me that if there are just 10 Jnanis in the world, it will be enough to save the world. Taking this, we can see that even if others did not do much, these jnanis will appease the devatas and keep the food cycle going. The results of yajnas are not equal to everyone. some may get floods and get washed away. some may get no rain, based on their karmas.

  

to me, if Yajna is taken in the larger sense as explained in so many verses, it is easier to explain in this manner: every being will be doing some sort of yajna as explained in so many verses, since there are different forms of yajnas. We have to accept that we need these Devatas to bring rains, since somehow life forms are supported by water and since we do not do much to bring rains, it is easier to assume that some divine forces do this job and sustain life.

  

3\) then comes the cycle issue, if you take the different bhashyas and match up the cycles, we have to match cycles exactly the way gita says. We cannot short-circuit the cycle to lesser elements in the chain given in Gita. Here I made a few graphics to compare different bhashyas. I will leave it to the readers to come up with their own conclusions.

  

as stated in Gita:
