Now , coming to the question of whether fires can lead to rains,

  

there are many observations such as

# Weatherwatch: how bushfires create their own rain  <https://www.theguardian.com/news/2014/jan/27/weatherwatch-how-bushfires-create-rain>

# The rising plume of smoke above a fire is the visible sign of a larger updraught of hot air, carrying moisture from burning vegetation. As this updraught mixes with colder air at altitude, the water vapour condenses into fluffy white cloud called Pyrocumulus, from the Greek*pyro*for fire. As it grows, the cloud may develop into anvil-shaped Pyrocumulonimbus and produce a shower of rain. This might even extinguish the parent fire.
