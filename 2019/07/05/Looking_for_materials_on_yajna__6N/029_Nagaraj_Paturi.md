While reiterating your position that it is not needed to look for rationally valid knowledge in Vedas and ancient Sanskrit texts, you brought Sankara and Gitacharya and wanted to show that they too concur with you in saying thatVedas may contain knowledge that may get proved wrong at a later time in history.

  

Neither Sankara nor Gitacharya take such a position anywhere.

  

What Gitacharya says is , त्रैगुण्यविषया वेदाः निष्त्रैगुण्यो भवार्जुन .

  

This just delineates the scope of Veda with respect to moksha sadhana. It has nothing even something remotely connected to what you are saying.

  

Sankara talks about for which questions Veda needs to be consulted. He says that worldly disciplines are to be consulted for worldly questions. Vedas can help in knowing super sensory aspects. Even this is not the same as what you are saying.
