The diagram of Shri. Paturi-ji is very good, especially since it brings forth that the sequence of activities mentioned in the गीता-श्लोक-s 3'14 and 3'15 are to be understood in the reverse order, i.e. starting from अक्षरम्and coming up to अन्नम्.

  

I wonder, whether this also means that one should deliberate also in that order to see how the steps in the cycle get linked up.

  

To start withअक्षरम्, it comes to mind that one finds some definition ofअक्षरम् in the joint mention ofक्षरम्andअक्षरम् in द्वाविमौ पुरुषौ लोके क्षरश्चाक्षर एव च \| क्षरः सर्वाणि भूतानि कूटस्थोऽक्ष मुच्यते (गी. 15'16). Here one gets to understand that अक्षरःis कूटस्थः पुरुषः. If so, what isकूट ? It seemsकूट and गूढ are synonymous. This synonimity prompts referring to धर्मस्य तत्त्वं निहितं गुहायाम्. I often wonder that there is some curious phonetic linkage among different धातु-s and words derived from them. कुह्, कूट्, गुह्, कुटिल, गूढ, The phonetic linkage also seems to lend an element of synonimity in their meanings.

  

With this phonetic/etymological thought aboutधातु-s, if I should jump to the wordअन्नम्, I would like to deliberate howअन्नम् means food.अन्न is past passive participle of अद्. Meaning ofअद् is taken as food. Now, there is also a धातु अत् (सातत्यगमने) Considering the phonetic-etymological linkage betweenअद् andअत्, I may venture that both these have a common meaning of activation of energy. It is well-established that energies are latent also, apart from being active. If so, अन्नाद्भवन्ति भूतानि can also be interpreted to mean "a phenomenon emerges upon activation of energy." In atmosphere around there are hydrogen and oxygen, both independently also and also together as humidity. Only those atoms of hydrogen and oxygen would become vapor, which would have become charged particles, ions, and would hence get compounded.

  

How doesअन्नम्activation of energy itself happen ? पर्जन्यादन्नसंभवः. Activation of energy happens byपर्जन्य. I guess, the wordपर्जन्य has its etymology from धातु पृज् / पृञ्ज् (पृजिँ वर्णे)The wordवर्णे can be interpreted to mean "to color", i.e to coat i.e. to lend potential. The operating principle of electrolysis is to make atoms become charged particles, ions, which is the process of gaining and lending potential.

  

How doesपर्जन्य "gaining and lending potential" happen ? In electrolysis, gaining and lending potential happens when the anode and cathode are linked in an electric circuit. In electrolysis, setting up that electric circuit, inclusive of generating and providing electrical energy is यज्ञ. Process of electrolysis isयज्ञ.

  

Then only यज्ञाद्भवति पर्जन्यः Electroplating is coatingवर्णे which isपर्जन्यः.

  

How beautifully कालिदास says in मेघदूतम् - धूमज्योतिःसलिलमरुतां सन्निपातः क्व मेघः \|

  

Since theयज्ञ in electrolysis would includegenerating and providing electrical energy, there are many activities involved there. Hence यज्ञः कर्मसमुद्भवः The prefix सम् in the wordसमुद्भवः is also significant here !

  

In 18'13 and 18'14 पञ्चैतानि कारणानि are enumerated for सिद्धये सर्वकर्मणाम् for fulfillment of tasks. Among them is विविधाश्च पृथक्चेष्टाः which is कर्मसमुच्चयः Here what is mentioned asसिद्धये सर्वकर्मणाम्, rather कर्मसिद्धिः that itself isयज्ञः becauseयज्ञः कर्मसमुद्भवः.

  

So, what cycle एवं प्रवर्तितं चक्रम् is mentioned here is not just ofकर्मसमुच्चयः =>यज्ञः (the ritual of sacrifice)=>पर्जन्यः (the rains) =>अन्नसंभवः (the foods) =>भूतानि (the beings), but, it is basically a game of energies and potentials.

  

We are all obliged to participate in this game. Hence in ईशावास्योपनिषत् "इह कर्माणि कुर्वन्नेव,एवं त्वयि, इतः अन्यथा न अस्ति"

  

In 3'16 also यः (इदं) एवं प्रवर्तितं चक्रं न अनुवर्तयति, सः मोघं जीवति. means अमोघं जीवितुम् इदम् एवं प्रवर्तितं चक्रम् अनुवर्तनीयम्.

  

Of course अनुवर्तनम् of this चक्रम् need not mean that one should cause rains to happen by performing the sacrifice rituals. Singers, singing the मेघमल्हार-राग ardently, are said to have caused rains to happen. That ardent singing, if and when it can cause rains to happen,is alsoयज्ञः, because there is so much a game of energies and potentials there.

  

Participating in the game of energies and potentials isअनुवर्तनम् of the चक्रम्.

  

Not doing so is इन्द्रियाणाम् आरामः (इन्द्रियारामः) that is keeping the organs lazy, inactive. That is also अघायुः (अघेन आयुः)spending one's life sinfully.

  

The essence and moral ofअनुवर्तनीयम्चक्रम् is सततं कार्यं कर्म समाचार (3'19) keep doing doable work, nonstop. That too असक्तः unattached. Doing doable work, unattached, keeping oneself active, being involved in the game of energies and potentials should hence be understood asयज्ञः.
