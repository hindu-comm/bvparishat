Many thanks Prof. Nagaraj ji for making available papers of Staal and Bronkhorst.

I could download Prof.Staal‘s paper which is very educative. I could not follow certain sections of the paper which need some knowledge of Western thinkers. His treatment of Panini’s system is very lucid. I could only access only the first page of Prof. Bronkhorst.

There is no question of undervaluing the Himalayan intellect of Panini who constructed the magnificent structure of ashtadhyayi. He was not in my view when I talked about “absence of a logical frame”.

My comments were specific to science and mathematics texts in Sanskrit. Instead of making general statements let me explain by a few examples.

These 2 verses are from Bhaskara’s Lilavati which states Pythagoras Theorem known in India since the time of Sulbasutras.

इष्टो बाहुर्यः स्यात् तत्स्पर्धिन्यां दिशीतरो बाहुः ।

त्र्यस्रे चतुरस्रे वा सा कोटिः कीर्तिता तज्ज्ञैः ॥ १॥

तत्कृत्योः योगपदं कर्णो दोःकर्णवर्गयोः विवरात् ।

मूलं कोटिः कोटिश्रुतिकृत्योरन्तराद्बाहुः ॥ २ ॥

Here तत्कृत्योः योगपदं कर्णो gives the Pythogoras formula. There is no mention of how it can be derived. A respected and reputed professor of mathematics (he is no more), told me that proofs are not given in Sanskrit texts and they give methods or formulas but not the logic behind the formula. Referring to some specific text he said that while detailing Pythogaras theorem, a diagram is shown with a remark, “पश्य”. They are more like books on geometrical construction which describe the method of construction but not the rationale behind it.



Here is another example from a Prakrit text on prosody वृत्तजातिसमुच्चय of Virahaanka..

 **“द्वौ द्वौ पूर्वविकल्पौ या या मेलयित्वा जायते संख्या ।  
सा उत्तरमात्रानां संख्याया एष निदेशः ॥६-४९ ॥“** \[संस्कृतच्छाया\]

This gives the formula for Fibonacci sequence and again a proof or explanation is missing.

F(n)=F(n-1)+F(n-2).

I do not know if this aspect has been studied in detail. I am subject to correction as there are so many Sanskrit texts on mathematics. Reason for lack of proof could be any one of the following:

1. Proofs were known and for their own reasons (secrecy or to exhibit wizardry?) authors did not write them down. Possibly proofs were transferred orally. (Any evidence?)

2. System of logical proof did not exist and that when a formula worked for a number of cases it was assumed that the formula was correct. (How do we reconcile this with the intellectual legacy of Panini?).



Then, one more point.

Why is it our science did not enable us to go beyond the wooden plow, the bullock cart and the pulley for drawing water? If we look at whatever we use daily we notice that other than our language, dress and customs (which are also mixed up) nothing is of Indian origin. Is it because we concentrated on knowing that by knowing which nothing else need be known?

Thanks and Warm Regards,

Murthy
