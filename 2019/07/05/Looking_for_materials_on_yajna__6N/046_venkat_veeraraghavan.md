Dear Smt Irene ji-  

  

I am not talking of believing X or Y.

Perceiving directly is not easy for most, which is why colleges and universities exist.

Sampradayas are the eastern equivalent of these for traditional ritual, arts and 'sciences'.

Even a Vivekananda needed a Ramakrishna who needed a Tota Puri and others.

  

If I want to learn Quantum Mechanics, I would not go to Deepak Chopra (although he does write a lot about Quantum this and quantum that).

I would enroll at Matscience Inst or Caltech or any other school that had a good reputable program in QM.

  

If I wished to study Tantra or Veda, I would apprentice with a person who has lived and learned within these systems. Belief has nothing to do with this. The issue is one of trustworthyness of source. The trust factor is high when you know that the teacher comes from pedigree (sampradaya). I use sampradaya not in the narrow sense of certain modern neo-sampradayins, but in the true sense of the term.

  

It is ok to have an opinion, but to demand that system A obey the paradigms of system B is ridiculous to say the least and wreaks of inherent bias.

  

My 2 cents.
