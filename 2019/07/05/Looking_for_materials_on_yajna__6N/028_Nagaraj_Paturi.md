Dear Sri G S S Murthy-ji,

  

1\. Your approach to ancient Indian 'sciences' and technology was made by clear by you long time ago when you declared that it was a wasteful exercise to try to find sciences and technology in ancient Sanskrit texts. As an immediate response to

you unambiguously declared at

that

Your present response to the discussion on Yajna is very much consistent with that position of yours.

  

2\. Meanwhile, there is a great work, drawing knowledge useful for contemporary life from the ancient Sanskrit literature. There is some information related to this in that thread itself where you made your post above.

  

3\. Problem with your approach can be exemplified through the case of your way of looking at the question of S'abda being mentioned as the guṇa of ākāśa .

  

You say, "If they had a clear idea of vacuum and that sound is a form of mechanical vibration, they would not have made that observation."

  

Here you yourself decide that they meant vacuum by ākāśa and and then proceed to declare that their view "sabdaguNakam aakaasah" was wrong on that basis.

  

That the ancient Indians had a clear understanding of how sound is produced and is spread was shown by Dr Sivasenani Nori-ji at

  

<https://groups.google.com/d/msg/bvparishat/hB9DdoifIWI/hA3k5u6hJQAJ>  

  

When someone says that A is the quality of B, he does not mean that B is the medium of A. So sabdaguNakam aakaasah does not mean aakaasa is the medium of sabda. .

  

It is prudent to think that since no one, even the stupidest of humans ever can see sound being produced by sky or vacuum, no one can be imagined to have averred that sound is the quality of sky or vacuum. So anyone who translates for onself sabdaguNakam aakaasah as " śabda is the quality of sky or vacuum would immediately realise that one's translation of ākāśa as sky or vacuum itself must be wrong.

  

Just recently there was this thread on BVP :

  

<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/bvparishat/$20akasa%7Csort:date/bvparishat/CH1VtTSxqRM/Q9QnCcKrCAAJ>

  

why participants in that thread were trying to figure out what was meant by ākāśa was this common sense only that if such rigorous s'āstrakāras were saying that s'abda is the guṇa of ākāśa , there must be some point in that. Since the translation "Sound is the quality of sky" is
resulting in an obviously stupid statement stupidity in which is not consistent with the rigor and intelligence displayed by those who made the original Sanskrit statement, there must be something wrong in the English translation -- is the line of thinking that was running throughout that discussion. That discussion was inconclusive but nevertheless on the right lines because it was based on the principle of consistency that stupidity found from the translation is inconsistent with the intelligence displayed otherwise by the makers of the original Sanskrit statement hence the wrong should lie with the translation. 

  

3\. This approach of doubting the validity of translation does not always arise out of religious respect towards the maker of the translated original statement. Even if one were to hear an obviously stupid statement as a translation of the statement made by a forsest-dweller's culture of some remote continent, the suspicion always is on the validity of the translation itself and not on the sanity of the maker of the original statement.

  

4\. Similarly, when we try to make sense of statements such as यज्ञाद्भवति पर्जन्यः , we try to see sense in the statement, not necessarily out of some religious respect towards the text or its author. Trying to make sense need not be viewed as forcing justification.

  

5\. यज्ञ is not limited to rain making or making rain into a fertilizing rain or a cloud-seeding-like activity or any such rain related activity alone. यज्ञ was and is performed for many other results and with many other purposes. Here , in this context, one of all those numerous benefits of yajna is being focused on.

  

In this very adhyāya from where the verses under discussion have been chosen, just a few verses earlier, we have

  

सहयज्ञाः प्रजाः सृष्ट्वा पुरोवाच प्रजापतिः ।

अनेन प्रसविष्यध्वमेष वोऽस्त्विष्टकामधुक् ॥ ३-१०॥

yajna is being called इष्टकामधुक् here.

  

In the immediately next verse, Yajna is being described as a mutual give and take between 'nature forces' and humans. ( That Vedic devatas were nothing but 'nature forces' has been there right from the days of the crudest modern understanding of the Vedic texts. )

  

देवान्भावयतानेन ते देवा भावयन्तु वः ।

परस्परं भावयन्तः श्रेयः परमवाप्स्यथ ॥ ३-११॥

  

This particular verse is strikingly significant because this is the verse which very clearly establishes that among

  

1\. nature-dominating

  

2\. nature-fearing and

  

3\. nature-friendly

  

approaches towards nature, Vedic approach was that of #3. (That modern S & T is seen as having the worldview of #1 above is well known. Stereotyped primitive man descriptions are on the lines of # 2 above.)

  

That thisपरस्परं भावयन्तःis very much in line with the contemporary environmentalist understanding is obvious.

  

6\. Based on the enormous amount of literature on the elaborate procedures of yajnas, sophisticated understanding such as that of geometry found in such books dealing with yajna procedures etc., it is prudent to think that yajna was not some nonsensical activity. When we try to make sense of statements such as

यज्ञाद्भवति पर्जन्यः, we proceed on those lines. When anything in those lines is found to be stupid during the understanding of such lines, we find fault with our understanding of the lines and not with the original lines, for this reason.

  

Warm regards,

  

Nagaraj
