Sorry Sir if my way of expressing caused you confusion. Testing observing hypothesing etc referred to Scientific Method which employs both induction and deduction. Mathematics (Euclid) on the other hand is essentially deductive.

Scientific method is a ladder to reach results. It cannot be considered Science if scientific methods are not employed. Engineering is not all Science, there is much that is empirical. Deep learning using neural networks is not science. It works and we do not understand how it works.

You are perfectly correct in saying that if Scientific method only is science, then progress of science is to be equated with progress in scientific method. Except that I did not mean it. I was emphasising the importance of the Means to reach the End.

May be I need to take a course on how to reduce the distance between what I want to say and what I say.

Thanks and regards,

Murthy
