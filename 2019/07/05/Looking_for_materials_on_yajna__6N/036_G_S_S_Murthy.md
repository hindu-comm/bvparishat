I presume Irene Galstian-ji's note refers to my previous notings. I have heard of Weil's conjecture but not ofGrothendieck's machinery. I tried to google, but google is no ladder to climb up to the ethereal layers of mathematics. I am not capable of talking at that level.

I talk at the level of a schoolboy/girl's fascination with Euclid's theorems and their proofs. I am vaguely aware of the problems in axiomatic set theory, Godel's Incompleteness theorem etc. But they are at a totally different level, what I may call the fine-structure of
Mathematics. The failure of logic at those levels, I believe, has very little to do with the absence of a logical frame in Indian Science/mathematics texts.

Thanks and regards,

Murthy
