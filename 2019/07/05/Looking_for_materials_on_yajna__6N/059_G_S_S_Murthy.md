Thanks, Prof.Nagaraj ji for your detailed comments.

1\. I do firmly believe that it is the Methodology of Science and Mathematics that is the core of Science and not the results. When we talk of nurturing a scientific temperament it is the methodology of questioning, observing and hypothising, re-testing re-hypothising etc. that we want to nurture in our younger generation.

2\. I am ignorant of the Nyaya system. My teacher gave me a chaatu, which is more tamil than Sanskrit. It would be well known. Let me quote at least just to show that our people were good at pulling legs even.

श्यामा कुट्टिरयं साधुः कुट्टित्वात् पूनिकुट्टिवत् ।

पाम्बु कुट्टौ अतिव्याप्तिः तद्भिन्नत्वं निवेश्यते ॥

Humour apart, it would be an interesting project if Euclid's proofs could re-molded in the form of Nyaya-logic. I am aware that I may not be making sense. I would like to learn why it does not make sense.

Thanks and Regards,

GSS Murthy
