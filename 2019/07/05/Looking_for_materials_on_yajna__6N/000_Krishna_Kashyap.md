I was teaching 3rd chapter Gita: Verse: yajnAt bhavati parjanyaha.

- meaning "yajna" caises rains. Thanks to Prof Kannan's small paper on Yajna. that was very useful.

  

I was reading different vyakhyanas on this, stating a verse from :'The oblations offered in fire reach the sun, and from the sun comes rain' (Manu, 3.76), 

  

  

**Then come the questions: did it rain before human beings were created? if so how.**

**  
**

**Somehow, this chakra or cycle, is interpreted in different ways and nothing seems complete and clear.**

  

Some state (abhinava gupta) that Yajna is much deeper than this. Yajna is process of experience. Sense objects are offerings to Indriyas, which are Devathas. Parjanya in this commentary is taken to be the experiencer.

  

Some explain yajna as community work or in a way selfless work. Even though how can work cause rains? this is still a question.

  

**I am looking for a deeper analysis of "Yajna" which is convincing to present day generation.**in general and in particular to the chakra : annat bhavanti bhutani. I am l checking all the available commentaries on Gita.

  

If there is a thorough assessment of Yajna, it would be useful.

  

In wikipedia, However, connecting yajna as it is given in earlier texts such as:In the Upanishadic times, or after 500 BCE, states Sikora, the meaning of the term Yajna evolved from "ritual sacrifice" performed around fires by priests, to any "personal attitude and action or knowledge" that required devotion and dedication.^([\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yajna#cite_note-sikora86-6))The oldest Vedic Upanishads, such as the Chandogya Upanishad (\~700 BCE) in Chapter 8, for example state,^([\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yajna#cite_note-hume266-13))

**No matter what the commentary is, a clear understanding regarding how devathas shower rain when pleased by yajna, has to be clearly explained. If people were created prior to earlier forms of life like reptiles, how did they get water to survive?**

**  
**

**In some commentaries, the next verse evam pravarthitam chakram nanuvartyati cha yah..... which indicates a cycle, is not very clear.**

**The explanation of cycle is not coherent.**

**  
**

**OR it may be stated that devatas showering rains, due to yajnas cannot be understood scientifically or logically. just trust in vedas.**
