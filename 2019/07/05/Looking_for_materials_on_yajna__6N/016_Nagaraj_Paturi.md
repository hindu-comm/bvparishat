Thanks, Sri G S S murthy-ji for that response which certainly helps me
to make my expressions more accurate than earlier in connection with yajna -cloud relationship.

  

It is true that the composition of clouds is essentially water vapour or water in a cloudy state.

  

This awareness is evident in Gita where it is said that it is the Sun that pulls the water up and releases it back. The Sun here is as evident from different expressions in the Vedas and Vedic texts, includes many effects of the Sun including atmospheric temperatures.

  

Thus smoke forms clouds is not an accurate expression.

  

But certain smokes lead to acid rains is a contemporary observation. Certain smokes cause healthy rains was an ancient belief. Whether it is accurate or not to say that acid rains are caused by 'bad' clouds, when
acid forming elements are included in the view of a 'cloud' , it sounds reasonable to think that acid rains come from a bad cloud. In the same way the cloud that is believed to be participating in fertilizing rains can be viewed as a healthy cloud. If an acid rain causing smoke generating activity is viewed as a bad activity, activity that is believed to lead to fertilizing rain can be believed to be a good activity. Parjanyah is the cloud and the fertilizing good effect getting added to it put together.
