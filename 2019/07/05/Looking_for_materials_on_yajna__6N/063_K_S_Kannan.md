To explore another aspect of the issue:

When it is stated that  

1\. **A causes B,**

does it mean  

2\. **A alone causes B** (or that

3\. **A causes B alone)**?

The maxim *sarvam vAkyam sAvadhAraNam* has its limits.

Assertions of *ayoga-vyavaccheda* and *anyyoga-vyavaccheda* are not done carelessly,  

for they demand great care.  

  

Consider the statement

4\. **10 litres of petrol takes me a hundred kilometres.**

Now, does it mean that  

5\. **Petrol *alone* takes me a hundred kilometres** ?  

The many *sahakAri-kAraNa*-s may go unstated  

when things are evident in the context to the listener/the audience.

  

In common parlance we make statements which are not strictly true,  

but carry a ring of truth nevertheless.

Consider

**6. It is the seed that gives rise to the plant.**

**7. It is the sowing of the seed that gives rise to the plant.**

**8. It is watering that gives rise to the plant.**

**9. It is the fertiliser that gives rise to the plant.**

**  
**

The structure of the sentence may be the same in all of 6 to 9,

yet each sentence carries a ring of truth.

Not one of these may be categorically declared wrong,  

even though none of these is giving a full picture.

  

In essence, none of the statements above may be said to be violating the Law of Causation,

even though none is stating the same exhaustively.

It is only where the statement  

**10. Yajn"a causes rains**

is assertively interpreted as

****11. Yajn"a alone, singly, causes rains****

that the truth of the statement (or rather the interpretation) becomes questionable.

  

(It can still be not thoroughly invalid in a way,

for, even though statements 6 to 9 all look alike in regards the sentence-pattern,

statement 6 states a rather quintessential truth than the rest.)

  

Causation is indeed not easily stated, especially where it is complex -  

dealing with a multiplicity of causes and/or multiplicity of effects.  

  

To draw an analogy from Computer Science, in Expert Systems,

causation is often asserted as a probability (e.g. 0.87),

rather than as a simple yes or know.  

  

Medical diagnosis has to run on such lines rather than on simple assertions.

Even the most ancient texts on Ayurveda have been acutely aware of  

the mutiplicity of causes/effects.

  

A hallmark of true science is **caution in respect of causation**.

And the hallmark of a good student of science is  

a proper **grasp of the spirit** **of** even bald causative statements.

  

No statement of causation can perhaps be considered complete/perfect till it is not quantified,

and no text on metaphysics can be *expected* to make any quantitative assertions.

The role of the Guru is often in turning the qualitative statement of a spiritual text  

into a technology that is specific in its quantifications.
