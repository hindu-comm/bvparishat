Dear scholars,

  

The Sloka अन्नात् भवन्ति भूतानि is difficult to explain. My understanding is as follows:



It can be explained by examining other verses which employ the world yajna in the Gita.



For instance, 3-9 says, यज्ञार्थात् कर्मणोन्यत्र .... in which the meaning for the word yajna is यज्ञो वै विष्णुः - for the sake of Vishnu, in other words, karma done with ईश्वरार्पण बुद्धिः



3-10 reads सहयज्ञाः प्रजाः .... in which सहयज्ञाः is a बहुव्रीहि, meaning "people who have been created inseparablywith obligations". The human being is created along with certain obligations.

अनेन प्रसविष्यध्वम् means “by such harmonious actions you multiply/prosper”. It means that man is not the boss of the universe, but he has to live in harmony with it.



3-11 says देवान् भावयत … in which देवाः means इन्द्रादयः – various manifestations in nature. In other words, cosmic energy manifest in different forms. They should be harmony among the अधिभूत, अधिदैव and अध्यात्म levels. परस्परं भावयन्तः – mutually nourishing. 



3-12 यज्ञभाविताः … nourished by yajna, which means desire-free actions, service oriented actions. The individual, व्यष्टि, has to contribute to the aggregate, समष्टि



3-13 यज्ञशिष्टाशिनः .... Those who enjoy after sharing with others. The concept of पञ्च महायज्ञाः are meant here.



3-14 अन्नात् भवन्ति भूतानि .... The whole world consists of रयि and प्राणम् (*Prasnopanishad*), matter and energy. अन्नम् is that which eats and also gets eaten. Thus it refers to the whole resources in the universe which are the life-source for the individual, the microcosm.

The next expression यज्ञात् भवति पर्जन्यः can be interpreted at a philosophical level to mean that by our harmonious actions with respect to the forces of nature, the nature also would be bountiful to us.

The Indian tradition has always respected nature. When we take a dip in a river we apologize to it. When we dig the earth we respectfully say मृत्तिके हन मे पापम् ...



3-16 एवं प्रवर्तितं चक्रं .... the wheel of interdependence and harmonious action. Nourishing the eco system which nourishes us.



Chapter – 4 of the Gita uses the word yajna metaphorically to mean any action done in the interest of समष्टि or any austerity leading to self-purification (4-28)



4-31 यज्ञशिष्टामृतभुजो .... after performing/fulfilling the societal/ethical obligations, what remains is शिष्टम्.

The Taittiriya Aranyakam (10-64) starting with तस्यैवं विदुषो यज्ञस्य आत्मा यजमानः, श्रद्धा पत्नी ... uses an extended metaphor describing how the whole lifetime is spent as a yajna by the spiritual seeker.
