Many thanks for the elucidation provided by Prof. Nagaraj-ji."Certain smokes cause healthy rains was an ancient belief." Yes, I agree there. Heavy conflagrations like forest fires, which produce large quantities of obnoxious gases could affect the composition of rain. But to extrapolate and say that smoke arising from yajnas cause rain is not justified.

In my view, our ancients generalized on the basis of their observations, which were gross. There is nothing wrong in accepting that they were wrong sometimes. I may be straying here. But let me say. They said, "sabdaguNakam aakaasah". They endowed "aakaasha" with the quality of "sound"..If they had a clear idea of vacuum and that sound is a form of mechanical vibration, they would not have made that observation. We need not and should not defend such statements. Our ancients including the Gitacharya, Shankara rtc.had the guts to say that Vedas do not take us far. We should appreciate their attitude of not accepting everything and agree not to accept everything that has come down to us. I am aware that my view is limited by my horizon of knowledge and those who know more may excuse me. Sorry for straying.

Thanks and regards,

Murthy
