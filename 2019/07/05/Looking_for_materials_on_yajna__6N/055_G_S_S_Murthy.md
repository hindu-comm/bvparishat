Dear Sri. Venkat Veeraraghavan,

Thanks for the points you have made. My comments are:

1. I went to the website and glanced through info. Available. It speaks of Kerala's contribution of Kerala to mathematics.

2. You certainly make a point when you say that conditions that existed would have thwarted a healthy development of science and mathematics. It is also possible that some valuable works were lost due to burning, marauding, etc.

3. Lilavati is not a book on rituals. It is a book on mathematics. It is strange that it does not provide derivations. Do any of Kerala mathematicians provide the logic behind their results?

4. To say Vedas were lost and they might have contained precious knowledge does not add to our knowledge. They can neither be proved nor disproved.

5. When you talk of Arundhati star or time dilatation having been known in India, I do not know how they could be given any weight. Development of Science is structured each one building up on what exists, sometimes demolishing it too. I am unable to see such a structure in Indian Science.

6. As for vaimanika shastra it is I believe established that it is a hoax like Vedic mathematics.

Many thanks for your thought provoking notes.वादे वादे जायते तत्त्वबोधः

Warm regards

Murthy
