Respected scholars,

   I feel all of you saw the Sanskrit movie Adi Shankaracharya (1983). In that movie while explaing to the question of veda vyasa mahamuni on the brahma sutra of sadhanadhyaya तदन्तर प्रतिपत्तौ the sage sankara explains the Chandaogya upanishad verse असौवावलोको गौतमाग्निः -------------- वर्षस्संभवति ------------ यावदायुषं जीवति -- . I feel the procedure was explained there.

  

In the following link you may get the mantras along with the video of the movie.

Thank you.
