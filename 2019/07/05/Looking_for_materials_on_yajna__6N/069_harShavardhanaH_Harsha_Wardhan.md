Namaskar to all

  

Perusing the entire thread over the night, I have found much clarity on several issues, not just the yajna aspect of BG. This sort of deep collaborative discussions and learning on Indian knowledge is something rare, given today's environs, and we must take a moment to appreciate this. BVP is doing signal service here.

  

Just wanted to sum up the points discussed so far, for my own understanding + the benefit of future perusers:

  

1\. Yajna-rain causal link can be best understood as a broad-strokes (but essentially true in causal and scientific terms, nevertheless) representation of an important ecological cycle that is fundamentally relevant to the proper understanding of the interconnectedness of several aspects of life - physical (re annam, food), mental (re right action, karma), and spiritual (supra-sensuous, re devas, brahman). In the BG, the illustration of the yajna-rain causal linkage is adduced as an ancillary point in a chain of illustrative links starting from 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13 thru 3.14 and 3.15, culminating in the introduction of the main point (3.16, and also 3.19), which is essentially that one must not forsake one's place in the greater cycle of existence and that one must keep performing one's proper activities sans sensory passion.

  

2\. The force of conclusions of Indian knowledge cannot be gainsaid just because the thrust of Indian methodology is a bit different from what we are now familiar with (modern scientific methods). Yogipratyaksham (Sri Korada's point elsewhere, and also mentioned by Sri Karve in the thread) has played a central role in our ancestors' workings throughout, and while its output(s) may perhaps be un-appreciable or un-understandable to us today, due to their having been firstly, incomplete (historical depredations) and secondly, explained in archaic terminology/contexts, the outcomes, when properly perceived, are never erroneous, or in question. A skeptical attitude in dealing with traditional knowledge is healthy, but ab initio cynicism is unwarranted.

  

3\. Every text has a context, as Dr TS Rukmani had mentioned elsewhere, and both have their place. If we seek to exegesize the BG's contents by disregarding its milieu, we will have incomplete understanding. So, while explaining the BG, or for that matter any Indian text, to a modern audience, we must also sensitize them to the context. That will necessitate some open-mindedness or flexibility (but not the abandoning of logic, reason or skepticism) on the part of the recipients. We must never seek to fit old concepts into contemporary frameworks without appreciating their respective contours first. Consensus ad idem is the principal thing here.

  

warm regards

Harsha
