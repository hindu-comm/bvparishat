Anna, Bhuta, Parjanya, Yagjna, Karma, Brahma, Akshara, these are the spokes of the wheel the center of which is ParaBrahma (Ara iva ratha nabho) who is all pervasive and full of trigunateeta attributes (sarva gatam).  

  

Human beings are not the only life forms (jeeva). Devatha, Yaksha, Gandarva, Chakravartis, Rshis, Danava, Daityas, Asuras, Rakshshas etc are other. So we don't have to be here to get the circle going. Other enlightened souls will keep doing the right thing.  

  

Akshara (Lakshmi) controls Brahma (Chaturmukha) who does Karma (through devatas) and performs (Yagna) and gets boon (Parjanya) which carries Jeeva down the lokas to Bhu loka where Bhuta are born and taken care by Anna (Prakruti-Lakshmi). Parabrahma is the center of all this because it is he who is providing Jnana Ichcha and Shakti to all life forms (including Lakshmi and Chaturmukha) and controling (niyamaka) to all Jada forms. Hence he is everything (sutre manigana iva). He is auspiciously present in Yagjna (Yaja-Devapujayam, Yaja-Sangatikarana, Yaja-Dana).  

  

Hence, Yagnat bhavati Parjanya need not be interpreted as Yagna causes rain. PARJANYA-prajananam janayati iti Parjanya, Prakrushta janmam dadati iti Parjanya. Rain happens everywhere (Varsha) but Parjanya brings boons that give rise to life forms (oushadhi, Sasya, jeeva).  

  

Please read Bannanje Govindacharya version of Geeta Bhashya and Aitareya Bhashya and Chandogya Bhashya, based on Madhwacharya's work. You wont have any doubts.

  

Best wishes.  

  

Best,  

Sudheendra Rao
