Dear Shri Murthy ji:  

  

Point no. 2-->"..conditions that existed would have thwarted a healthy development of science and mathematics. ... possible that some valuable works were lost due to burning, marauding, etc."

  

I am not suggesting Science did not thrive in ancient India. Merely that it was destroyed and we have no hope of knowing the exact extent of damage. Your second part is elaborately understated to say the least. It is well recorded that Mughals and the other Muslim invaders whether Timur the lame or Ghazni or Ghori were bloodthirsty bigots who looted, burnt and raped their way to whatever heavens they believed in. To describe this holocaust over the last 1000 years before the East India Company as mildly as you have described is akin to denying that any jews were murdered at Auschwitz or Dachau. But I guess we have our leftist history books to thank for that!

3\. Lilavati is one among many manuscripts. It is not known how scholars of that day and age organised their manuscripts and indexed them. It is not known how many survived and how many are lost or ruined.

4\. Vedas can never be lost. The links are lost and hidden but lost ...? You really should pay close attention to what Shri Sivasenani Nori has written. To disregard what people like he and Sri Korada write is to ignore 12+ years of painstaking study these people have made of the Veda and attendant angas.

5\. The problem with why you are unable to see the causal linkage is that you have not (apparently) come in contact with accomplished Yogis (not the flotsam jetsam of the spiritual marketplace). If you were to plot the magnetic lines of force of a bar magnet, you will find many lines of force going from one pole to another in curved lines of force without ever seemingly reach the other pole, while there is a direct connection within between the 2 poles. This is a great analogy for modern science vs the traditional Vedic method. While the former investigates the outside world ignoring imperfections in the senses that process the data, the latter focussed on purifying and refining the senses to perceive reality as it is. The former leads to quick approximations and usable models. I will not pretend that people had phones or TV in the age before the industrial revolution, but telepathy and clairaudience existed.

I will leave you with the words channelled by the Rshidīrghatamas:

ऋ॒चो अ॒क्षरे॑ पर॒मे व्यो॑म॒न्यस्मिं॑दे॒वा अधि॒ विश्वे॑ निषे॒दुः ।

यस्तन्न वेद॒ किमृ॒चा क॑रिष्यति॒ य इत्तद्वि॒दुस्त इ॒मे समा॑सते ॥

The rks, reside in the transcendental field or akshara, of the highest (parame) etheral skies (vyoman) in which reside all the adhi vishve deva's (or impulses of creative intelligence, the laws of Nature), responsible for the whole manifest universe. He whose awareness is not open (na veda) to this field, what can the verses accomplish for him?  

This is why chitta shuddhi through japa of Gayatri is required so that the those that would approach the Veda can do so with the right attitude.

As Don Juna through Carlos Castaneda said: "“A man goes to knowledge as he goes to war: wide-awake, with fear, with respect, and with absolute assurance"

6\. I believe Shri Talpade designed an unmanned aircraft late 19th century based on one of the designs.

  

Kind Regards,

  

Venkat
