' Cycle' , 'Cycles' is an important concept of contemporary environmental/ecological understanding.  

  

Particularly, there is an emphasis on the role of living creatures , particularly humans in this cyclic chain events in the environment.

  

Leaving alone which of such cycles is being described or discussed and the 'scientific' validity of the described or discussed cycle, the principle in

एवं प्रवर्तितं चक्रं नानुवर्तयतीह यः\|

अघायुरिन्द्रियारामो मोघं पार्थ स जीवति\|\|३- १६\|\|

  

is part of /in tune with / the same as the contemporary environmentalist understanding.

  

" Follow / live in tune with the cyclic self regulated and self sustained natural eco-system. You are part of the cycle. Your role in the cycle should be such that it keeps the cycle healthy or at least does not disturb it " is the contemporary environmentalist message.

  

What is at the the root of the present environmental crisis?

  

Human has become इन्द्रियारामः .This is the present environmentalist understanding too.

  

What is the result of such a crisis?

  

मोघं स जीवति  

  

is the present environmentalist lamentation too.

  

Your participation in the cyclic eco-system should be भूतभावोद्भवकरः , not the opposite of it. This is the present environmentalist message too.

  

A person who is notइन्द्रियारामः contributes own materials with the attitude of संप्रददे न मम , ..........आय/अये/ etc.(चतुर्थी ) स्वाहा ,आय/अये/ etc. (चतुर्थी ) इदं न मम . That is why it is called विसर्गः .

  

The verb root at the root of the word यज्ञ ,यजदेव पूजा-संगतिकरण-दानेषु has themeaning daana which is visarga. It isसंगतिकरण , co-ordinating, connecting, organizing of theभूतभावोद्भवकर karmas.

  

चक्रानुवर्तन of the cycle ofभूतभावोद्भवकर karmas performed by भूतानि being organized (यज) into events leading back toभूतभावोद्भव is the main point . Whether पर्जन्यः is an intermediary in this cycle or not is secondary.
