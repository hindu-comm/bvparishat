Dear Prof. Nagaraj-ji,

I am most thankful to you for having thought that my notings merited a rebuttal from you. I am used to silence as an answer which is at once profound and derisive.

You have taken the trouble to dig out the archives and show that I have been consistent in my view in this matter. I am guilty of having wasted your precious time. I am dismayed that I have been forced to be consistent. I do not consider consistency a virtue for a learner like me.

Prof.Sivasenan Nooriji's findings on Shabarabhashya are indeed an eye opener. That extract does not talk of "aakaasha", however.

It is my observation that whenever we can gleam a bit of science in our heritage, the texts available do not-I am subject to learning and correction here- explicitly bring out the logical chain of thought behind their general statements. Shabara bhashya as quoted by Prof.Noori does not say how the author arrived at the proposed theory.

Upanishads do talk of experiments conducted and how based on the gross observations they arrive at certain conclusions. But somehow somewhere this method seems to have got lost. Even in mathematics, theorems and methods of calculation are given without explaining the rationale.

In other words, even where we discern some science we do not see any scientific method. Of course, we have been great in classification.

Whether it is smoke-rain relationship or sound-aakasha relationship if it can be justified it is fine. But any contrived, belaboured and circuitous explanation need not be attempted. Let us gloss over and proceed beyond. There is so much profound, beautiful and everlasting in the ancient texts that we need to assimilate.

It is important that our young Sanskrit Scholars do not become conformists (We have 15 or more Sanskrit Universities) and do not think beyond what is there in the texts.

नवतरुरोपणमस्य न कार्यं कत्थति तरुरयं मे ॥

It is the rebels who leave footprints on the sands of time and not the conformists. Sorry, I seem to have descended to pontification. Amen.

Just before clicking "send", I saw your latest post, Prof. Nagaraj. What I read into a text, you do not. Let us agree to disagree.

Thank you once again, Prof. Nagaraj.

Regards,

Murthy
