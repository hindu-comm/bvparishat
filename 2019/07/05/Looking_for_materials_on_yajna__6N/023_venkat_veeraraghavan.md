Dear Shri Krishna Kashyap ji:-

  

**I am looking for a deeper analysis of "Yajna" which is convincing to present day generation.**

  

--> Convincing the present generation is fraught with peculiar problems.

  

The present generation with its partial grounding in 'science' and consensual mass hive mind has a set of rules that defines its own paradigm of thought.

  

A deeper analysis of "Yajna" would need to go into its traditional roots in terms of thought, belief and practice that has its own paradigm and zeitgeist.

You can achieve one but not the other.

  

I have seen a need amongstmodern'scholars' in trying to define the Purusha sukta as Big Bang and other such modern scientific theories. Such thought would be a disservice to both the Purusha Sukta and the Big Bang Theory.

It is entirely possible for the one to have validity within its context without validation from the other. This is because the two are possessed of entirely different contexts.

  

I saw a gentleman on a TV show called Grahacharam try and describe Rahu kalam as the time when UV rays rule with some sort of VIBGYOR chart.

  

The same gentleman mixed planets with grahas when they are clearly NOT the same.

This is precisely the kind of exploration that results in accusations of dabbling in pseudo-scientific enquiry. Not only does it draw ridicule on the shastra and the shastris, it also debases trust in shastra among the cognoscenti, the ignorant and those in between.  

  

There are records in shastra of Brahma and devas performing Yajna, so this precludes the need for humans as a causal factor in the 'rainman' effect. Brahma, Devas, Nagas, Rakshasas and Gandharvas do not fall under the manusha yoni.

Also, in sanatana dharma the cycle of life is a *cycle* of creation and destruction unlike in Abrahamic thought where creation is a unique one time incident until one final judgement day (offer available for a limited time only) where all men are 'judged'.

  

In sanatana dharma there is mention of Rshis who predate even cosmic time as mentioned in shastra.

  

The best way of understanding Yajna in all its dimensions adhibhautika, adhyatmika and adhidaivika is to perform agnikaryas and Japa as per vidhi. There is no way of rationalising this.

What is confined within manas cannot understand prAchetasa.

  

Kind Regards,
