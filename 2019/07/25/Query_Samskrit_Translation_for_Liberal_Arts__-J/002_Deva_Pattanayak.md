Dear Gowtham,

Liberal Arts does not need any translation. It is what it is.

The department of Philosophy of your institution will fall into the category of Liberal Arts.

Historically the British imposed on India their language and education system while wiping out the then existing and flourishing languages and educational system according to the likes of Nalanda, Pataliputra,
Takhshila etc.

I am not suggesting going back to the old system, but the present educational institutes in India need not change well accepted terminologies.

The IITs and the central universities and your institute and many others are functioning very well and there is no need to change the names like Liberal Arts into non-existent equivalent words in Sanskrit or other Indian languages.

Emphasis must however be given to provide students to go from one discipline to another. In many successful universities, a graduate from Liberal Arts field, such as English and Philosophy can pursue Medicine and Physics provided the student is willing and capable to make the transition. Cross disciplinary team collaboration is the trend these days to solve unanswered questions in many areas, of neuroscience and linguistics to sight an example.

With best regards

Deva
