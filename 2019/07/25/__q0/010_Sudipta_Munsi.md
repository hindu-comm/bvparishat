Dear Prof. Wakankar,

  

I am working in a WWTF funded research project entitled "Reasoning Tools for Deontic Logic and Applications to Indian Sacred Texts", which aims at a formalisation of deontic principles in Mimamsa. The project is headed by my Ph.D. supervisor, Dr. Elisa Freschi of the Austrian Academy of Sciences and University of Vienna, and Prof. Dr. Agata Ciabattoni of the Technical University of Vienna. This is a major collaboration taking place among Indologists and logicians and computer scientists, whose professed goal is to preserve, circulate, promote, make better sense of and apply deontic principles of Mimamsa to present-day life. Further details of research going on within the project and some of the publications can be found at the following website:

  

<https://mimamsa.logic.at/>  

  

Sastriji has been a major source of enlightenment for me through his untiring grant of interviews, clarification of knotty issues, answering of moot questions pertaining to deontic principles in Mimamsa and also by line-by-line teaching of core Mimamsa texts like the Vidhiviveka of Mandana Misra, etc. during my stay in Chennai in January, 2019. He also delivered a very interesting talk in Sanskrit from India (per Skype) on the concluding day of a 7-day International Workshop on Mandana Misra's Vidhiviveka, organised by Dr. Elisa Freschi, and held at the Institute for the Culture and Intellectual History of Asia, Austrian Academy of Sciences, Vienna between 3rd and 10th July, 2019. 

  

Best regards,

Sudipta Munsi
