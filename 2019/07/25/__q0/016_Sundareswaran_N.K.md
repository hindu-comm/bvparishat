Dear list members!

Let me thank all the scholars who reacted encouragingly to my post.

Thanks for the kind words of appreciation.

As for me, it was a great experience to interview a learned scholar and realised soul like Shastri ji.

In him we can not see the weight of pedantry. On the other hand we feel the experience of bliss in his presence. A real विद्याविनयसम्पन्न.

There may be hundreds of scholars who are masters in many disciplines - polymaths. But rarest of the rare are अपारविनयान्वित s like Shastri ji.

This interview was recorded by our University for Doordarshan in 2016 or so to be included in the educational segment of some UGC programme usually telecast in the afternoons.

The technicality stipulates that many such videos of interviews submitted by different approved centres are to be okayed by a committee, l am given to understand. Also that the committee meets rarely and scrutinises a bunch of proposals. This segment of the program is named 'Interface'.

I don't know whether this interview has ever been telecast by DD. However, with the consent of our University Electronic Media Centre,
now I have published through YouTube channel.

Regarding the status of Mimamsa tradition in India today, as Shastri ji
rightly points out we have lost (for ever?) many streams and even valuable outputs. In Kerala, it is well known, that there was a great tradition of Mimamsa. The celebrated family of Payyur Bhattas made a
great contribution. The members of this family, for six generations,
have written significant commentaries on classic works on Mimamsa.

It is said that there was a practice in the family that every mature member have to come with a new sastric composition if he wants to participate in the Sraddha ceremony.

But none of the great works(recorded by historians ) are preserved for us.

This is the case of ' Mimamsa ' as a discipline.

Apart from this we have got our own indigenous मीमांसारीतिशास्त्र - out own methodology of analysis, discourses and thought processes. This we have almost lost in the case of many disciplines like Mathemattics and Medicine.

A collective sincere effort may bring in fruitful results in reviving some of these lost methodologies.

With pranams and thanks,

nks
