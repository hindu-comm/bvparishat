नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

supporting evidence resources on 'Virtue Ethics' from ancient Indian wisdom

  

                               ------ Vid Sridhar Reddy

  

What do you actually want ? As far as possible employ देवभाषा rather than म्लेच्छभाषा ।

  

Virtue and Ethics -- these words are nebulous and equivocal -- if one follows Ethics ( नीतिशास्त्रम् ) then it is a Virtue

(गुणः ) -- virtue x vice (दोषः) ।

  

In Indian tradition we have धर्म - untranslatable as it is pregnant with meaning and multi-pronged .

  

If you want evidence for धर्म / नीति (intertwined) it can be given extempore , right from वेद through वेदङ्ग-s - दर्शन-s -

पुराण-s - उपवेद-s - down to नीतिशतकम् ।

  

See clarity is not sacrificed .

  

धन्यो’स्मि
