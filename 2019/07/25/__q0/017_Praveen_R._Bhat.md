Thanks for your wonderful interview of Brahmashri Mani Dravid Shastriji. Shastriji's Sanskrit is a pleasure to listen to and especially this topic of his study was quite interesting. It is saddening to see how the Mimamsa tradition is losing its roots, but also heartening to see that the North-South disparity in Mimamsa following is being bridged by getting the right pandits to the right places.  

  

We have so many ways to preserve of what is left of the sampradAya today and I hope that we are able to hand over in excess to the generations that follow. May I request you, Sir, to interview more such great personalities in Sanskrit if at all possible via the University programme or in your individual capacity? It is more direct an approach to interview traditional people and dig into their own words than to present the findings, maybe a research scholar's way.

  

praNAm,
