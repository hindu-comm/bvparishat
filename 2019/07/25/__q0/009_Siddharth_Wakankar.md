Dear Shri Sudipta,

  

Some time back I had made a statement on some post here in BVP that the Sanskrit scholars should start writing in simple Sanskrit,so that it is easily understood.Your words like दौर्लभ्यं etc.prove my point that it is simple to write using difficult words and difficult to write in simple words. When we start using simple words,the things become simpler.



You seem to be comparatively a young scholar and if you start writing simple sentences in Sanskrit,you will also enjoy it and the readers will also appreciate it.

  

Pl. do not misunderstand me.

  

Best of luck in your studies.

  

By the way,what kind of work are you supposed to do there? Kindly enlighten us on it.  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
