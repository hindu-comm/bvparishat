Dear Sudipta,

  

Am very happy to acknowledge with many thanks the receipt of your detailed reply.

  

It is definitely heartening to know of the academic collaboration in your institute.It is a very good enterprise to show or prove the relevance of Sanskrit in modern times also.

  

Best of luck to all of you in this welcome and significant project.
