Thank you for this video.  
In addition to enriching the viewers on the subject of traditional  
education, it serves as an example of Sanskrit speech to be emulated  
(note also the helpful presence of subtitles for learners). I wish we  
could compile a repository of such videos, since there's a paucity of  
video and audio material in Sanskrit done by people with true command  
of the language and good diction.
