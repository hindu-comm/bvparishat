Dhanyawad Nagaraj ji,

For the detailed explanation.

  

My question was about the first meaning:

  

The very first meaning is (as adjective) - cast, thrown, secret, ill-behaved.

  

Can someone throw light on this? Why this meaning? How does it derive from the dhAtu?

Are there any examples of usage in this meaning?

  

  
Thanks,  
Shashi
