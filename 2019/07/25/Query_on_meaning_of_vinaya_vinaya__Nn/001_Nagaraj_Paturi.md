Dear Sri Shashi Joshi-ji,

  

विनय \< वि + नय

  

नय \< नी

  

धातु नी means to bring close to or to take away from

  

Prefix वि has different meanings such as without, apart, away, opposite, intensive, different etc.

  

All the different meanings you cited from the Apte have different etymological origins with different combinations of different meanings of these two : the prefix वि and धातु नी .

  

But in विनय = modesty, humility , वि means intensive and नय means restraint, holding back , discipline ; विनय thus meaning intense discipline changed metaphorically into modesty, humility.

  

This most popular connotation of the word is the meaning in which the word is borrowed into most Indian languages.

  

If you look into Apte itself, you have
