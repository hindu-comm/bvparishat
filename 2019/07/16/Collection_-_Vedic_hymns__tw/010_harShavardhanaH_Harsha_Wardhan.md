Thank you sir, for your kind guidance

  

A criticism leveled against people like Swami Dayananda and Sri Aurobindo is that they over-zealously read more into the Vedas than what is strictly warranted. Since people like Dr Kashyap and Dr Tulsi Ram have extended Sri Aurobindo and Swami Dayananda's ideas on the Vedas respectively, I wonder how the larger academic community and Indian scholars has treated these works and compared them with the literal/philological approach of western Indologists.

  

I personally am convinced of the lucidity of Sri Aurobindo's approach (Swami Dayananda's, I haven't tackled in detail yet, just know of what comes through in his excellent*SatyArtha PrakAsh*). In fact, I changed my opinion about some things after I went through Sri Aurobindo's*Secret of the Veda*sometime ago, and it was in connection with that study that I also had found out about Dr Kashyap's work.

  

As you have a personal connection with Dr Kashyap, perhaps you might know something about how the larger academic community and Indian scholars has received his translations. I am interested in knowing a bit about this aspect.

  

kind regards

Harsha
