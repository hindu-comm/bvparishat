Pranam to all

  

Is there any good collection (Sanskrit text + English translation) of Vedic suktas / hymns of philosophical import or significance that has been published?

  

I have seen some books on specific suktas only thus far, and I wonder if a larger project has been attempted by anyone in this regard.

  

Any inputs in this matter would be much appreciated.  

  

kind regards

Harsha
