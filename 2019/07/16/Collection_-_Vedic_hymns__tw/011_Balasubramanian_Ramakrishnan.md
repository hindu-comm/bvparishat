Harsha Wardhan-ji,

  

I don't know much about Swami Dayananda. But regarding criticism of Aurobindo and "reading too much in" etc., I look at this way. If you take Swami Tyagaraja's songs, some may have an appreciation for the sound of it, some may know the raaga-s intimately, but not really enough Telugu, some others may have an intimate knowledge of the language, some other all the above+ the philosophical background to understand the actual import of the songs. The former groups can accuse the the last group of "reading too much" into the songs, but that's their problem, not that of the last group. In any case, even within the vedas themselves the same thing is interpreted in multiple ways. For example, the sAvitra-chayanam chapter talks about performative aspects, Adhibhautika, Adhidaivika and AdhyAtmika aspects of the same chayana within a small space. Sayanacharya largely concentrates on the performative aspects in most places. But Sri Aurobindo's approach is neither completely new nor controversial. It is based on the veda-s.

  

Regarding Prof. Kashyap, my opinions are obviously going to be colored by my personal history with him. But look at it this way, his books are excellently proof-read and can at least serve as a rough guide, if nothing else.
