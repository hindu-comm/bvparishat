I don't have this set. But I do have the original text that he published<http://www.sanskritweb.net/rigveda/>in which he translated 100 sUkta-s or so.

  

A profile of Prof. Kashyap:

I took two classes with him when I was a graduate student at Purdue University - a brilliant mind. My room-mate got his PhD from him. I remember when he was about to retire he called me to his office and told me "you claim to be doing research in communication systems, you should read these books", and passed down a number of classic texts in probability and estimation theory in his bookshelf to me :-). I still have them.
