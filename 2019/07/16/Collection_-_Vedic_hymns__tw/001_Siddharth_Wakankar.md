Dear inquisitive scholar,

  

There are many books in English like Vedic Hymns by Peter Peterson, Selections from Vedic Hymns by Prof.B.B.Choubey etc.Prof.H.D.Velankar edited one book in Hindi, named,ऋक्सूक्तवैजयंती, महाव्याघ्र माहुली गोपालाचार्य wrote a book in English on Vedic Hymns and I think,it is published by the Somaiya Publications,Mumbai, some 35-40 years back.

There might be some other books published in recent past
