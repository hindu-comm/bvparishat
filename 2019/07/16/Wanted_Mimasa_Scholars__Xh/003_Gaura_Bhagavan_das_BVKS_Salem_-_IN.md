Dear all,

Hare Krishna

  

We are running a traditional gurukul in Salem, Tamil Nadu where we have about 20 boys from age 8 - 18 yrs. We are looking for a male Sanskrit teacher who can teach our boys Sambhashana, Vyakarana & one Veda if possible. The candidate should be willing to relocate to Salem. We are ready to offer a salary of Rs 30 - 35k. Fluency in English and Tamil is preferred.

  

Interested candidates can contact Citta Hari Dasa on[+91 9442132258](tel:+91%2094421%2032258). Thank you very much.

  
Hare Krishna,  
Gaura Bhagavan Dasa
