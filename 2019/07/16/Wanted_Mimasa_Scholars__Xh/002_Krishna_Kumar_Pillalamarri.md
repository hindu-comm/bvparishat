Dear All,

  

We have many young scholars who are good in Sanskrit and also a bit of English who are looking to work and earn a living. I am in touch with Dr. Rani Sadasiva Murthy, Dean of Sanskrit College, Rajamundry, Andhra Pradesh who is willing to collaborate with any institution anywhere in the world who would like to employ these people. This would give them exposure and confidence that Sanskrit learning will be remunerative.

  

I can work closely with Dr. Sadasiva Murthy garu to circulate the CVs of good scholars, so your qualification requirements will be definitely met. The opportunities must be remunerative jobs. Can any of you identify needs anywhere in the world and let me know? We will be doing positive service to the community.

  

DhanyOsmi,

Pillalamarri Krishna Kumar
