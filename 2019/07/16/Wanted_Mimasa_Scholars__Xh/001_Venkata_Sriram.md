Namaste,

  

You may contact Prof. K.Jayanarayanan OR Dr. K. E. Maheswaran Ji, who are young, energetic traditional scholars and faculty at Madras Sanskrit College.

  

Of course, the first preference should be Dr.Mani Dravida Sastrigal who is the authority in purva mimamsa and a very sober, humble traditional scholar who has

a passion for teaching youngsters.

  

Here is the profile:
