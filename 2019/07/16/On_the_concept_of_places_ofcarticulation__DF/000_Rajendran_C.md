Dear members,

Can someone clarify the source from which Bhattoji and others quote statements like akuhavisarjaniyanam kanthah etc ,stipulating places of articulation?

Secondly, why are these placesc at variance with the more scientific pespective seen in Pratisakhyas?

Thirdly,does Panini anywhere anticipate/autheticate these statements?

Thanking you in advance,

C Rajendran
