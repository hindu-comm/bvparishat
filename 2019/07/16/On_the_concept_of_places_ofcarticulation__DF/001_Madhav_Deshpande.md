Dear Professor Rajendran,

  

  The likely source of statements like these in Bhaṭṭoji's works is ultimately the prose Śikṣās attributed to Āpiśali and Pāṇini which are very similar in wording. These were edited and published by Yudhishthir Mimansak. Please send me a private email, so that I can send you the pdf of this publication. With best regards,
