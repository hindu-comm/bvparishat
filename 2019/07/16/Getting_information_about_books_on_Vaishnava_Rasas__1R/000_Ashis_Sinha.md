Sir,

I am in need of some book/s containing a vivid, analytical and exhaustive discussion on Vaishnava Rasasastra having discussion over
how Alamkarasastra played its role in Vaishnava Sahitya, Vaishnav Padavali, on epics like Ramacharitamanasa etc. I will remain ever grateful if any scholar of this Parishad may kindly provides me the information about how/ from where I shall get such books. With regards. Ms. S. Sinha.
