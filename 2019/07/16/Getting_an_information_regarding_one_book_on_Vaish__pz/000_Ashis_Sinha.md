Sir,

 I am in need of some books containing analytical and exhaustive discussion over Vaishnav Rasasatra showing how Alamkarasastra has played its role in Vaishnav Sahitya, Vaishnav Padavali and other books like Ramacharitamanas etc. I will be grateful if any scholar of this Parishat gives me an information about how and from where I may get such type of books. It is urgently required for my Phd Thesis.

  

                                   
           Yours faithfully,

  

                                   
            Ms. S. Sinha
