Pranams !  

  

I am happy to announce the list of 108 Gurus we are honouring for this years Guru Purnima. 

  

<http://www.indictoday.com/announcements/grateful-to-gurus-2019/>

  

Our first Grateful2Guru program was conceptualised in 2016. During the year 2017 we felicitated 6 scholars. From 2018 onwards we linked up the felicitation to Guru Purnima. During 2018 we felicitated 10 Gurus at various chapters.

  

For the year 2019, we decided to honour 108 Gurus and called for nominations from the public.

We have since received more than 200 nominations and an internal committee went through the same and shortlisted these venerable names.

  

I am thankful to all those in this group who have taken time and nominated their suggestions.

  

We will shortly be communicating to all thoseselected.
