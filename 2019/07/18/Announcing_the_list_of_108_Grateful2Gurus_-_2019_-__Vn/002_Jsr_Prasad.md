Sir,

  

It is very heartening to note this noble gesture of Indic Academy. We observe with awe all kinds of Sastra encouraging initiatives, motivating all knowledge seekers irrespective of class, age and language towards inculcating the ancient socio-cultural ethos and their contemporary relevance, through several projects of your trust.

  

Most people who earn considerable money for their livelihood, are never seemed to bother about dharmic duties to be performed in their mother land. You are determined to pay back some part of the 'ṛṇa' by conducting several projects on a mission mode, which is truly inspiring!

  

My prostrations to you. You truly deserve one of the higher civilian honor, at least, that I personally believe.

  

Pranams and congratulations to all 108 scholars that are conferred with this honor.

  

Bestregards,

Prasad
