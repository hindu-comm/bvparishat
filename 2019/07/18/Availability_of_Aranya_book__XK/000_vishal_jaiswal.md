Namaste, is Hariharananda Aranya - Yoga Philosophy of Patanjali with Bhasvati,

available as a physical book for buying inside India ?

  

On amazon, its not available anymore.

<https://www.amazon.in/Yoga-Philosophy-Patanjali-Bhasvati-Annotations/dp/8187594004>  

  

An ebook is fine, except the one offered on google ebooks is very expensive.  

  

Thanks,

Vishal
