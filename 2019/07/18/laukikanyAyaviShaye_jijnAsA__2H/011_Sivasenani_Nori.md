Rishi ji

  

If you had given the context of your doubt, it would have been easier. I am reproducing the context here for the benefit of others here. The particular line referred to by Rishi ji occurs in [page 7](https://archive.org/details/LogakshiBhaskarArthaSangrahaVachaspatiUpadhyaya/page/n75) of the book Artha Sangraha with the commentary arthaaloka of Panditaraja Pattabhirama Sastry. The first paragraph in Arthasangraha after salutation is: अथ परमकारुणिको भगवान् जैमिनिर्धर्मविवेकाय द्वादशलक्षणीं प्रणिनाय। तत्रादौ धर्मजिज्ञासां सूत्रयामास - 'अथातो धर्मजिज्ञासा' इति। अत्र अथ शब्दो वेदाध्ययनानन्तर्यवचनः। ***अतः शब्दो हि वेदाध्ययनस्य दृष्टार्थत्वं ब्रूते***। ***स्वाध्यायोऽध्येतव्यः इत्यध्ययनविधौ तदध्यनस्यार्थज्ञानरूपदृष्टार्थकत्वेन व्यवस्थापनात्।*** (Commentary on the underlined text is where Sri Rishi faced a problem in understanding).

  

The commentator Pattabhi Sastry first gives a brief account of the contents of the twelve adhyayas of Mimamsa. Then the following discussion ensues:

Now coming to the difficulty of Sri Rishi Goswami.

  

In Mimamsa, if there is a dRishTa phala, then adRishTa phala is rejected. Why? gauravAt, due to prolixity. In the samSaya expressed, the question is when there is the dRishTa phala in the form of arthajnAna (knowledge of meaning), why should the arRishTa phala be considered? (ननु दृष्टफलेऽर्थज्ञानरूपे लभ्यमाने किमित्यदृष्टं फलं कल्प्यते?)

  

अध्ययनं तावदर्थज्ञनाय भवति। न ह्यदृष्टलाभाय कोऽप्यधीते।

Study (of Veda) therefore is for the sake of understanding the meaning (of Veda). No one studies for the sake of invisible results.

  

अतश्च दृष्टार्थत्वमेवाध्ययनस्य भवत्विति चेत् न;

Therefore, if it be said that study be on account of visible results (arthajnana - knowledge of meaning, or understand the meaning of Veda), it is not so;

  

Why? तदर्थं विधेरावश्यकत्वाभावात् - since there is no need for the injunction for that purpose (arthajnana).

Why? विनाप्यध्ययनेन प्राकारान्तरद्वारार्थज्ञानसम्पादनं सुशकमिति - since it is quite possible to get an understanding of the meaning of Veda through some other means; also **'अप्राप्ते शास्त्रमर्थवत्'** इति न्यायात् - Sastra is needed only when the requisite knowledge is otherwise unobtainable.

  

Sri @Rishi Goswami, hopefully the meaning of the vakya in question has become clear now. The siddhanta is given in the last sentence in the above image - दृष्टार्थज्ञानफलकत्वमेवाध्ययनम्।  

  

Since I started the explanation let me finish it as well. First the sentence व्रीहीनवहन्ति needs to be explained. While making puroDASa, there is an injunction to pound or thresh the wheat (they pound grain - laT can also denote vidhi). The question arises as to why wheat should only be pounded (avahananam)? If the idea is to separate the chaff and grain (the drishTa phalam), other methods could be resorted to. The Vidhi which prescribes a particular course of action, when alternatives are available is called niyama-vidhi. (This is different from apurva-vidhi, which ordains something which was hitherto not known).

So the sentence न चापूर्वविधित्वाभावेऽपि 'व्रीहीनवहन्ति' इतिवन्नियमविधिरस्तु means "even though apurva-vidhi is absent, this could be a niyama vidhi like vreehinavahanti".

  

One more technicality is introduced - prakaraNam (we can think of it as context). उभयाकांक्षं प्रकरणम् is the definition given (later) in Arthasangraha. It denotes the relationship of inter-connectedness between two passages. The prakaraNa of darSapoorNamaasa yaaga (the sacrifice to be offered on amaavaasya and pUrNimA) is the deciding factor as far as vreehinavahanti is considered (the puroDASa is to be offered in the darSapUrNamaasa sacrifice), but no such context is available in the case of svaadhyaayo'dhyetavyaH as two connected passages are not found since study itself is not commenced. This is negated by offering uttarakratuvidhis as the niyaamakas. In order to understand the proper procedure for performing other yaagas, understanding the meaning of Veda is indeed required (as an anga of those sacrifices).

  

If I may make a suggestion, in the first reading these detailed commentaries may be skipped especially when the book itself clearly demarcates the text as विशेषार्थः। Whereas Laugakshi Bhaskara has made a great job of succinctly giving the gist of a huge Sastra with more than 1,000 adhikaranas , by insisting on reading the full commentary in the first pass, we negate that effort of simplification. This is found in other Bhashyas as well, say in Mahabhashyam. References are made to later part of Sastra, as if the student is already familiar with it. This is not really a dosha, since the bhashyakAra assumes that either the student is reading with a teacher or approaching it in the second pass (say, after completing prakriyA part - in practice Mahabhashya is studied after studying Kaumudi). So, when we start self-study, we need to skip the more detailed explanations and follow the Mula more closely.

  

Wishing you all the best in your admirable endeavours
