To put in a nutshell:  

The *s'Astra*/rule fulfils a role that is otherwise unfulfilled.

*prApta* is what you can gather from other sources.

*s'Astra* caters to such cases as are not *prApta*.

*artha=prayojana.*  

  

This maxim helps define jurisdictions and obviate redundancy.

  

Others may perhaps elucidate better.
