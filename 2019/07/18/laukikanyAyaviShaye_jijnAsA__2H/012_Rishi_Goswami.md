Dhanyavadah Noriji.

I'm so greatful to your efforts in wrotong such a long answer. It must have took a lot of time. I'm very thankful for this effort.

I was mistaken to understand this as "अप्राप्ते शास्त्रं प्रयोजनवान् भवति"

But this can be expanded as, "अप्राप्ते एव शास्त्रं प्रयोजनवान् भवति, अर्थात् यदा शास्त्रस्य प्रयोजनं तदैव भवति, यदा शास्त्रम् विहाय प्रकारान्तरद्वारा फलप्राप्तिः अशक्या। अत्र तु प्रकारान्तरद्वारा अर्थज्ञानं सुलभम् इति कथं शास्त्रारम्भः?"

Actually there are many questions that remained unanswered if I don't see the Tika. For example, my question was, that धर्म means वेदप्रतिपादित अर्थ and if अथ means after learning the षडङ्ग वेद, we automatically come to know the अर्थ. And it's said that धर्म is वेदार्थ then why need मीमांसा if अर्थज्ञान is only the प्रयोजन। अर्थज्ञान was already obtained when we learnt the 6 Angas, only then we come for धर्मजिज्ञासा।

So 2 problems here, 1) अर्थज्ञान cannot be दृष्टफल because अथ means after knowledge of षडङ्ग. And 2) Why need knowledge of धर्म seperately when it is अर्थ of the Vedas?

So I looked up various books. I found a solution in सर्वदर्शनसङ्ग्रहः। which was pretty satisfactory.

But now, as you explained, I will try and do the मूल and understand how much ever I can, and move on. In the 2nd attempt, I will try to analyse all the left out parts and doubts.

Thank you.  
Abhaari.  
Rishi.
