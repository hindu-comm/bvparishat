Respected scholars,

  

I am getting introduced to the concepts of formal discussion / kathaa.

After learning about the nigraha sthaanas, I got interested in "trying it out" with someone, but it needs a set-up involving one or more sabhikas, a good topic, aside from an equally interested prativaadi.  

Is there any forum/group/website where there are sufficient number of like-minded people who practice this for pleasure and/or learning?

  

Or, is there a book that collects several such discussions verbatim (and what happened at the end). The subject matter is not of importance to me at this time. I want to get familiarized with the techniques.

p.s. This link states the kind of kathaa I'm referring to --> <https://hinduism.stackexchange.com/a/14684/466>

  

Thank you.
