You can search the YouTube resource to locate some videos where such sessions are conducted by some maTha-s in Udupi. A topic is taken up and two scholars (both of Madhva following) are nominated one as the Dvaitin and the other as the Advaitin and the debate is conducted. It is held in the presence of the pontiff and other senior seasoned scholars.

  

Here is one, though not exactly as stated above, where the topic of 'Tattvamasi' is taken up for discussion. The Advaitin's stand on the topic is presented by Dr.A.V.Nagasmpige Acharya and the other scholars present the rebuttal of the same based on various works of the Madhva school.

To my knowledge there is one book 'अपच्छेदन्यायवैषम्यम्' which is a rendering of an actual debate/discussion in Bangalore. The small book is available in Purna Prajna Samshodhana Mandiram, Bangalore, for sale. It has the discussion summarized, not exactly verbatim, by stating what each school's scholar/s said on the topic and the concluding remark by the Pejawar Srigalu. There may be other similar books.
