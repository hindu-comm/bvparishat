As for RV 1.164.24, is "measure" (Ludwig, Jamison-Brereton) really a felicitous translation here?

To my 2007 article I would like to add an \*update\* 28-7-2019 and revert to my 2000 translation of the verse:

  

According to the Gāyatrī (-line) one makes the song of praise (arká); according to the song of praise a chant (saáma), according to the Triṣṭubh

(-line) the recitation; according to the two- and four-lined recitation (again a larger) recitation; according to the SYLLABLE they make the seven VOICES.  

  

note: With “According to” I revert to my 2000 translation of this verse,  
taking the verb in the first line, práti mimīte ‘make in accordance with; copy’ (Grassmann,  
1875, p. 1023-1024: práti mā, wonach \[I.\] ein Lied \[A.\] bilden) to be valid in the two  
subsequent lines, and even in the last line (simplex pro composito) where the verb is explicitly  
given as mimate (viz. práti), but the construction with instrumental is continued from the  
previous lines. (See further explanation in the article.)
