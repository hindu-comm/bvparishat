नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

I'm looking for a scan of V Raghavan's small 8 page ekāṅka-rūpaka Kāmaśuddhi. It was first published in the journal [Amṛtavāṇī (1946)](https://www.worldcat.org/title/kamasuddhi-nama-ekankarupakam/oclc/60782438&referer=brief_results) and then again through [Samskṛtaranga (1963)](https://www.worldcat.org/title/kamasuddhirnama-ekarikam-rupakam-kamasuddhi-an-one-act-play/oclc/314791823&referer=brief_results). I would be very grateful if someone could share a scan.

  

If anyone is interested, I have [uploaded a scan](https://archive.org/details/PreksanakatrayiRaghavan) of his other set of ekāṅka-rūpakas, prekṣaṇakatrayī.
