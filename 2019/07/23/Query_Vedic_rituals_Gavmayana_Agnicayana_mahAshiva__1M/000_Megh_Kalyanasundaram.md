Namaste,

  

Query: If anyone is aware of published disagreement/s with, or critique/s of, conclusions arrived at in[this](https://www.currentscience.ac.in/cs/Volumes/109/10/1882.pdf)paper(also:[www.jstor.org/stable/24906158](http://www.jstor.org/stable/24906158)),by Dr. TRS Prasanna,and would be kind enough to share a reference, I request the same. Thanks in advance.The conclusions, from the aforementioned open-access paper, are reproduced in full (highlighted in yellow) below:

"Kane had stated decades ago that Vedic rituals, and not linguistics, are the proper basis to understand Vedic literature. The present work validates Kane’s contention with a distinction that the combined expertise of Sanskrit scholars and scientists is essential to understand Vedic rituals. The central theme underlying Vedic rituals is the renewal of Prajāpati, the creator God, who was exhausted after creating the universe. This theme was expressed in two rituals, Gavāmayana and Agnicayana, making them of equal importance. This theme was derived from the cyclical Year, making the Year the primary evidence in Vedic texts. Solstices represented the Year, due to which the most important festival days in the Vedic period marked them. Sanskrit scholars and scientists have interpreted the most important Vedic rituals, Gavāmayana and Agnicayana (and Mahāśivarātri) to \~3000 BC contradicting AIT/AMT. Their conclusions are supported by archaeological evidences from the Indus Valley Civilization. Other evidences in Vedic texts must be interpreted in the context of the robust consensus on Vedic rituals and not in isolation." (Prasanna 2015:1887-8)Prasanna, T. R. S.
