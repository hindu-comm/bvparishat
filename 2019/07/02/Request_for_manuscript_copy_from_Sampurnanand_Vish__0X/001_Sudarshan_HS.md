It may not be easy to obtain a copy without yourself going there.

  

There is an alternative. Check if the manuscript has been scanned & available with IGNCA using <http://ignca.bestbookbuddies.com/cgi-bin/koha/opac-search.pl>

  

If available, you will be able to obtain a copy from IGNCA (BLR or DEL).
