Namaste

  

It is well known to scholars/researchers/students that the entire core corpus of Advaita literature has been/being brought under the banner 'Advaita Sharadaa' of the Sringeri Sharada Peetham.

  

In this page
<https://advaitasharada.sringeri.net/%E0%A4%AE%E0%A5%81%E0%A4%96%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%AF%E0%A4%AA%E0%A5%83%E0%A4%B7%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A0%E0%A4%AE%E0%A5%8D/>

  

one can see a large list of names of texts. It is possible to make a search for particular words in each of these texts, This facility will be of utmost help for students/researchers. Words like 'mithyaa, adhyaasa, vivarta, aikyam, samucchaya, tattvamasi, moksha,...' etc. can be searched in each of these works listed / displayed on the above page. In the 'anveshanam' head, on top of the above page as a menu, one can initiate a search across the entire prasthana traya Bhashya of Shankaracharya by choosing 'sarvam'. Individual text search is also possible on that page. One can see the results delivered on another page as 'phalitaamshah' and copy the results for one's further notes, articles, etc.

  

This excellent resource has been developed by Sri C.S.Yogananda and his team under the company name Sriranga Technologies, Mysuru. They are working hard to include more and more texts to the resource. The utility of the resource is immense indeed.

  

warm regards
