Dear Dr. Vyas,

  

Happy to see your mail.

  

May I remind you to please return my original notes on Manuscriptology which you took on the 1st of September,2016.

  

Even after repeated reminders,you are not answering nor are you attending to my phone calls also.

  

Pl. try to keep your own words as a scholar,because,you are seeking the help of other scholars too.

  

Should I hope that you will answer my mail and immediately return my notes.

  

Thanks for your kind gesture.

  

Best of luck in your career.

  

Prof.Siddharth Y.Wakankar.
