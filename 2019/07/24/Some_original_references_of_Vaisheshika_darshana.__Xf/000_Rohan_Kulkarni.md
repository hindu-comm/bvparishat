Respected scholars,  
I am seeking for some original references of Vaisheshika darshana.  
I require the following: -  
1) Ishvara as the instrumental of the world.  
2) Atoms as the material cause.  
3) Mundane existence of jivatman.  
Please note that the above references are required of Vaisheshika darshana. The references of Nyaya are not needed.  
  
Yours sincerely,  
Rohan Kulkarni.
