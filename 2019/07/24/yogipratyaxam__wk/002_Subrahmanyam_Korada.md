नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

Vid Harsha Wardhan ----

  

1.Can we consider this to be the precursor of the later idea of*dhyAna*(*dhyai*), or is the idea already here, fully developed but cryptically expressed?

  

No doubt, the origin of योग is there in वेद , उपनिषत् and पुराण and the same is developed by

हिरण्यगर्भ as शासनम् and later by पतञ्जलि as अनुशासनम् । Origin of योग is available in --

  

1. **श्वेताश्वतरोपनिषत् (**2-8) -- त्रिरुन्नतं स्थाप्य समं शरीरम् ...

  

2.योगशास्रं च मत्प्रोक्तं ज्ञेयं योगमभीप्सता ( **पद्मपुरा.** 3-110)

  

3.**विष्णुपुरा** 6-7 , **गारुडम्** 14-49 , **मार्कण्डेयपुरा** अध्या 39 , **लिङ्गपुरा** अध्याय 9

  

2.*Is there anywhere a technical elaboration of the process of tapas in our scriptures?*

*  
*

**तपः** --

  

**योगानुशासने** (2-32) -- द्वन्द्वसहनम् ( सुखदुःखे , शीतोष्णे , मानावमानौ etc ) - **व्यासभाष्यम्**

  

**धर्मशास्त्रेषु** -- व्रतानि -- कृछ्र-अतिकृछ्र-चान्द्रायणादीनि

  

अन्यत्र -- नियमविशेषः (**पार्वतीतपः**)

  

3.*dhI*comes closest in content and shade of meaning to what is indicated by the technical termसंयम. Am I right in concluding this?

  

ध्यै चिन्तायाम् (भ्वादिः) -- क्विप् - ’ ध्यायतेः संप्रसारणं च ’ (वार्तिकम्) -- धीः ।

  

बुद्धिर्मनीषा धिषणा धीः प्रज्ञा शेमुषी मतिः -- **अमरः ।**

  

One should concentrate on a particular thing etc is already explained - धीः plays the important role in संयम ।

  

4.if these hymns, content-wise, and in the context of what we now know as yoga practices, can be said to recognize anything approaching our idea ofयोगिप्रत्यक्षम् (orसंयम)

  

An important suggestion -- please read the original books - do not touch the translations .

  

According to Indian tradition the entire Vedic literature / वेद is नित्य and the वेदाङ्गानि s well as दर्शनानि too . So the

question of earlier / middle / later does not arise at all .

  

यती is not a wanderers - a यती / संन्यासी can be a जटी / मुण्डी etc - see धर्मशास्त्र-s .

  

Every मुनि / ऋषि is equipped with योगिप्रत्यक्षम् ।

  

5.***mAnasa agnihotra, bhAvanA homa*.**This is an intermediate stage from the external activity (ritual) to the internal (mental). This is a development of*dhI*in a different, downstream context, I think.

  

अग्निहोत्रम् is a नित्यकर्म ( even अग्निकार्यम् for a ब्रह्मचारी) - when it is not possible to perform the practical ritual शास्त्रम् / शिष्टाचार prescribes मानसिककर्म । This is not anything else . The problem

is our people , instead of studying / learning the originals here in this country , started reading something mostly by some Western scholars - it is difficult to undo what is done wrongly in its entirety.

  

6 &7.**practically synonymous with**संयम**in content**, regardless of the term upAsana being glossed as prayer or worship etc. Is this proper?***Vidya-s from the Upanishad-s*.**

  

उपासना is different and संयम is different . There can be one thing common -- concentration (धारणा ) - in the case of

उपासना on the deity . विद्योपासना gradually leads to समाधि -- कैवल्यम् ।

  

8.I just take nididhyAsana to be**practically synonymous with**upAsana,**content-wise**. Am I right in doing so? Is there a difference here that is escaping my notice?

  

एकतानत्वमेतद्धि निदिध्यासनमुच्यते -- **पञ्चदशी 1-54**

  

तत्र प्रत्ययैकतानता ध्यानम् -- **योगानुशासनम् 3-29**

  

**निदिध्यासनम् in वेदान्तदर्शनम् is nothing but ध्यानम् in योगदर्शनम् \|**
