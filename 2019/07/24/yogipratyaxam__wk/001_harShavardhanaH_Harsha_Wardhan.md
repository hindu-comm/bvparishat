Thank you very much for taking the time to pen this excellent and detailed explanation, Sri Korada Subrahmanyam Garu



Some points I now recall you'd also mentioned when I'd come over to your place to meet with you last year



As you have kindly explained, योगिप्रत्यक्षम् can be equated with the technical term (*tAntriki paribhAshA*, as vyAsa says)संयमfor all practical purposes. This is quite clear to me.



With this as the practical/technical basis, I am trying to further understand how योगिप्रत्यक्षम् / संयमcompares with, or emerges as an idea in the context of, the below concepts:



**(N.B: This is as much a follow-up post as it is an occasion to organize thoughts) -**

**  
**



1)***yuj*(yoking) of*manas* by the rishi-s*****.***There are several references in the Rg Veda. Here is the earliest mention of the idea of consciously controlling or linking the mind, in my limited view. Can we consider this to be the precursor of the later idea of *dhyAna* (*dhyai*), or is the idea already here, fully developed but cryptically expressed?

  

2)***tapas*.**The *nAsadIya-sUkta* gives the foundation for this (यदासी**त्तपस**स्तन्महिनाजायतैकम्) idea which the vedas mention extensively and also which the various principal upanishad-s take up and elaborate. *Is there anywhere a technical elaboration of the process of tapas in our scriptures?* From my rudimentary study of the Upanishad-s, I think tapas cannot be clearly distinguished from the three ‘inner’ limbs of pAtanjala-yoga (dhArana-dhyAna-samAdhi). I think yoga is but a further development of tapas, though patanjali *et al* mention it in its limited form as a *niyama*.





3)***dhI*, (*dhyai)* of the vedic rishi-s**. This idea is extensively present in the vedic sUkta-s, and comes through as the principal idea (from the yogic point of view) in the Rg Veda. Just as an example, in Rg Veda 5.81.1, the idea of*yuNjate dhiyo / dhiyah*is emerging, which Jan Gonda has specially studied. *dhI* is understood here as supra-normal seeing or mental vision or insight or revelation on the part of the rishi through some sort of contemplative activity. It is also thought that it has ancillary shades of meaning such as intuition, prayer, power etc. We are concerned with the principal meaning here, mostly. I personally think, based on my admittedly inadequate study so far, that*dhI*comes closest in content and shade of meaning to what is indicated by the technical term संयम. Am I right in concluding this?





4) **the*muni-sUkta***(ref. kEsin hymn, 'long-haired') of Rg Veda 10.136. Here, this sUkta is understood by some commentators to adduce the earliest evidence of yogi-s doing yogic practices in the Vedas. Also, there is a mention of ***yati-s***, or wandering ascetics, in Rg Veda 8.3.9 and 10.72.7, for example. (These mentions are stray in the Vedas, and do not come into the main stream.) I just wanted to know if these hymns, content-wise, and in the context of what we now know as yoga practices, can be said to recognize anything approaching our idea of योगिप्रत्यक्षम् (or संयम), or if represent something else altogether.





5) ***mAnasa agnihotra, bhAvanA homa*.** This is an intermediate stage from the external activity (ritual) to the internal (mental). This is a development of *dhI* in a different, downstream context, I think.



  

*(N.B: Below, I mention only relevant principal early upanishad-s. There are several developments of the idea of upAsana, vidyA, yoga and ancillary concepts in other early upanishad-s, the middle and later upanidshad-s that I have not touched, because they are all familiar to us. Just focusing on the early mentions, trying to trace the conceptual development)*





6) ***upAsana of the upanishad-s***. Extensively mentioned and developed in the principal upanishad-s. Also, for e.g.



*tam yatha yatha upasate, sa tathaiva bhavati *(Br.Su.),



*tat chintanam tat kathanam, anyonyam tatprabodhanam, etadekaparatvam cha, brahmabhyasam vidur budhah.* (Panchadasi, 7.106)



I would like to understand this to be **practically synonymous with** संयम **in content**, regardless of the term upAsana being glossed as prayer or worship etc. Is this proper?





7) ***Vidya-s from the Upanishad-s*.** (principally, BrihadAranyaka, Chhandogya, Taittriya, etc)



A species of the genus upAsana only, it strikes me.





8) ***nididhyAsana***. Just mentioning for reference, from the Br.U



आत्मा वा अरे द्रष्टव्यः श्रोतव्यो मन्तव्यो निदिध्यासितव्यो मैत्रेयि,

आत्मनो व अरे दर्शनेन श्रवणेन मत्या विज्ञानेनेदं सर्वं विदितम् \|\|



There are shades in interpretations of the term nididhyAsana by inspired Vedanta guru-s, and they are all excellent and there is no point in splitting hairs here. I just take nididhyAsana to be **practically synonymous with** upAsana, **content-wise**. Am I right in doing so? Is there a difference here that is escaping my notice?





To sum up, **on practical grounds, the core idea, the thread running throughout (****the foundational practice)is common; differences, if any, arise from the target or various grounds of application.**

**  
**

**  
**

I am aware of and open to the possibility of my being wrong on some (even most) points.I would very much appreciate, in that case, to being guided onto the right path by the words of seniors and gurus here.

**

with kind regards

Harsha
