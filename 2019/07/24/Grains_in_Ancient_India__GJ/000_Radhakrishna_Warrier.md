I learnt the word vrīhi (व्रीहि) when we were taught the bahuvrīhi samāsam in high school Malayalam class. Later, I read that vrīhi (rice) is not mentioned in the Vedas. Also read that vrīhi and its Persian cognate baranj (برنج from Middle Persian brinj or blinj) could be borrowings from an eastern language from which Dravidian too borrowed the word for rice.

Can we glean from the Vedas any information about the daily diet of the average person of those times? What was the staple grain consumed during the Vedic times? Was it yava (barley)? Or wheat? Was wheat popular in Vedic times? I presume that wheat is mentioned in the Vedas. Is the word used for wheat godhūma with a long ū or godhuma with a short u? The former would literally mean the smoke (dust) raised by the cows. Were barley and wheat used for ritual offerings in Vedic times? Is there any knowledge about the staple grain consumed during the time of Harappan civilization?

At present it looks like barley and wheat do not find a place in ritual offerings. At least not in Kerala, as far as I know. It is rice that is the most prominent grain used in ritual offerings in Kerala. Boiled hand-pound brown rice is a naivedyam (offering) in most traditional temples of Kerala and is called Padachoru (paṭaccōṟŭ പടച്ചോറ് ). There are many varieties of pāyasam (kheer) but that which is offered as naivedyam has rice as the main ingredient. Other popular offerings like Unniyappam and Ada have also rice as the main ingredient. The piṇḍa offered to the pitṛ during śrāddha is again rice. It is boiled rice mixed with a little sesame, yogurt and ghee, and rolled into balls by hand. Different from the piṇḍa are kavyan (Sanskrit kavya) and havissŭ (Sanskrit havis). I remember preparing, under instructions from my uncle, kavyan for the pitṛ and havissŭ for the deva-s. Essentially, both were rice preparations.
