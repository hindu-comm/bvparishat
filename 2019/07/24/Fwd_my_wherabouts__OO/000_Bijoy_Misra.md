Dear friends,  

I have been in Odisha for three weeks. After having completed the

rituals for my deceased brother-in-law i did get an opportunity to visit

Bikramkhol rock edits (30 km from Jharsuguda), It could be the oldest

known rock edict in India. It is possible that it contains both the Harappan scripts and the writings in Brahmi script. The language is likely proto-odia. The trip is difficult, but is rewarding. ASI is helping,

but slow.

I have a lecture this afternoon in my old College (now Ravenshaw

University). I speak on Indian Philosophy and Language in their

Ravenshaw-150 lecture series. It is a continuation of the celebrations

for the completion of 150 years of the college.

I plan to catch up with the Indic Academy seminar in Delhi on the 26th

and take the return flight early morning of the 27th. 

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
