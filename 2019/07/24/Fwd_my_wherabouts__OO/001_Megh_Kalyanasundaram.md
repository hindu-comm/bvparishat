Thank you very for the update pertaining to Bikramkhol, Dr. Misra.  

Good to learn that ASI is involved and is helping.

Best wishes for your talk.

  

Regards,

Megh

  

(Danino 2010:217-8): “In the same category, the mysterious inscription in the Vikramkhol cave (in Orissa), some 10 m long and 2 m high, was studied by the eminent epigraphist K.P. Jayaswal, who concluded in 1933: “The Vikramkhol inscription supplies a link \[in\] the passage of letter forms from the Mohenjodaro script to Brāhmi.’”
