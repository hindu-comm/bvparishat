\>\> points  
\>\> in his presentation Prof. Ramasubramanian affectionately engaged this  
\>\> younger audience by asking simple questions pertaining to some of what he  
\>\> was presenting.  
\>\>  
\>\>  
\>\> Prof. Ramasubramanian highlighted some of the key contributions of Indian  
\>\> mathematicians such as the methods to solve indeterminate equations of II  
\>\> order, and said that to this day the methods used by Indian  
\>\> mathematicians  
\>\> remain the most sophisticated and remarkable.  
\>\>  
\>\>  
\>\> He highlighted the contributions of Kerala school of mathematicians in  
\>\> the  
\>\> mediaeval period, most prominent name from that period being Madhava.  
\>\> Several children and the adults in the audience were familiar with this  
\>\> name, and also with that of Bhaskara and his famous work Lilavati. Prof.  
\>\> Ramasburamanian showed the audience a couple of examples of problems from  
\>\> Lilavati and encouraged the audience to work through these problems. He  
\>\> also gave another interesting example of construction of magic squares, a  
\>\> problem found in a 14th century text by Narayan Pandita; many children  
\>\> found this quite intriguing.  

\>\> ------------------------------  

\>\>  
\>\> Towards the end of his lecture, Prof. Ramasubramanian shared comments  
\>\> by some of the leading scientists and mathematicians of recent times  
\>\> which  
\>\> bring to light the remarkable work done by the ancient Indian  
\>\> mathematicians. He concluded with a few general but highly significant  
\>\> remarks about some key lessons that can be learned by studying the  
\>\> works  
\>\> and approaches of ancient Indian mathematics. These lessons concern  
\>\> how to make mathematics education approachable and interesting for all,  
\>\> and  
\>\> how to connect mathematical learning with facilitating overall  
\>\> creativity  
\>\> in the learners. These are generally ignored in the way mathematics is  
\>\> taught in the modern education systems.  
\>\>  
\>\>  
\>\> The lecture was followed by a few questions from the audience, which  
\>\> Prof. addressed. The event concluded with a vote of thanks by Dr.  
\>\> Beloo  
\>\> Mehra, Senior Associate, SAFIC, who also reminded the audience of a
