In this Telugu Kavya, there is a discussion between a grihastha and his ascetic guest about touring opportunity for an ascetic and lack of the same for a naishthika grihastha .The guest gives a magical foot-paste that can instantly transport the user to the place of his wish. Using this, the naishthika Brahmin householder transports himself to Himalayas. With this, the first chapter of the book ends.

The second chapter in its early part , has a description of touring in Himalayas .

  

The Kavya has a lot more portion later to that, where tour aspects are absent.

  

But the conversation in the first chapter between the householder and the ascetic about lack of touring time / leisure for a naishThika Brahmin householder is interesting.
