Now that there is no further info from others on "archavataravilaasa", I have a fear that the the work might have been already lost or may get lost unless special efforts are made.

It was printed and published in the later part of 19th century or very early part of 20th century. I distinctly remember that it has been listed in "kavicaritre"(kannada) of R Narasimhacarya. The author is Srinivasaiyengar/ Srinivasachar of Gorur ( my village). It describes the srivaishnavakshetras which an elderly couple visits and is in Shatpadi Metre breaking into Sanskrit stotras at places. I had the book(borrowed and as usual not returned from my school library) which I have lost. I request those who have access to old libraries in Karnataka to look for the book.

Thanks and regards,

Murthy
