\> There are some works in Telugu language on travelog, like manuchsritra of Allasani peddanna of 16 yh century, kadiyaatracharitra by enugulaveeraswami and many more. Can I prepare a paper on these works ?

  

--- For the benefit of those list members who are not aware of works in Telugu literature, may I say that Dr B Vani is talking about a 16th Century trend setting Kaavya, narrative poem called Svaarochishamanusambhavamu also called as Manucharitramu by a poet Allasaani Peddana from the court of Sri Krishna Deva Rayalu.

  

Recently this book has been translated into English
