As a continuation of the ideas presented in the Call for Papers,

  

may I suggest

  

grouping of kshetras into schemes such as aṣṭādaśa s'aktipīṭhas, dvādaśa jyōtirlingas, 108 divya dēśas etc.

  

as a possible theme under which different topics for papers can be chosen.

  

History of such grouping, purposes and functions of such grouping, patterns and sources of such grouping etc. can make good topics to study.
