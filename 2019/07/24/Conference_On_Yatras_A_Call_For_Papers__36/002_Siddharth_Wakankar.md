A very good and important initiative,for which you deserve hearty congrats.

  

In 1991, my book named Chetovinodanakavya authored by Daji Jyotirvid,that is,modern Joshirao,from that famous family who own the Binkhambi Ganapati Mandir in Kolhapur,was published by the Oriental Institute,Baroda.

  

It is a very good account of the author's journey from Kolhapur to Kashi, Gaya etc. and back for performing the Shraddha of his father.Therein occur neatly 500 shlokas describing our indoor games like Chess,Playing Cards,Dyuta etc.

  

The journey is undertaken with a very unusual or novel objective.

  

There are scholars who are working and publishing their research in the field of Pilgrimage Studies,whom we can profitably contact for their output and expertise.

  

Best of luck in this novel and much untapped enterprise.
