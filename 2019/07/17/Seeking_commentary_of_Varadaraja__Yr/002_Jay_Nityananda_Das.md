Dear Shankar ji,



Namaste,



Thanks for giving your time and energy in generating this input for me!



My curiosity aroused to see various commentaries on Valmiki Ramayana when I came across a question from Valmiki Ramayana about Lord Rama and Laxman having mentioned of eating deer meat**(Valmiki Ramayana 2.52.102)**. Some commentators maintain that (paraphrasing mine) there was no fault of Lord Rama in eating deer meat as it was included within the vanya-AhAra,मांसस्य च वन्याहारान्तर्गतत्वान्न दोषः(Ramayana-tilaka-kara), alsoउक्ताहारस्य वन्याहारान्तर्गतत्वात् ग्रहः(kataka-tika-kara)as Lord Rama was exhibiting the role of a ksatriya (and not that of a Brahmana), so, it does not fall outside ksatriya allowance.न ह्यनयोर्ब्राह्मणवत् मृगहननेऽतिदोषः मृगयाधर्मकत्वादेव(says Kataka-tika-kara)



If the question arises, how Lord Rama, who had declared in many places in Ayodhya-kanda that He would live on fruits and roots, could break His own promise---in answer to that Kataka-tika-kara says thatबुभुक्षितौ तेषां मेध्यं मांसं त्वरितमादायेति। बुभुक्षावशात् केवलमग्नितापमात्रं कृत्वा स्वीकृत्येत्यर्थः। ........पूर्वंकन्दमूलफलैर्जीवन् हित्वा मुनिवदामिषम्' (अयो. 2029) इत्यभिधानं तु सुसंस्कृतमांसभक्षणविषयम्। अतो न विरोधः।



While commentator Ramayana-shiromani-kara explains that Lord Rama and Laxman went for hunting but, they ate only fruits and roots etc.(phala-adikam)तत्र वत्स्यदेशे वराहादीन् चतुरो महामृगान्हत्वा खेलनार्थं सन्ताड्य बुभुक्षितौ तौ रामलक्ष्मणौ मेध्यं व्रतिभिर्भोक्तव्यं फलादिकमित्यर्थ: ।



Whose conclusion is correct, and how?---it is well known that there are instances in studying commentaries there could be more than one possible interpretations of the same text, and all of them could beaccommodated, however in this case, both the paksas can not be accommodated as either one of the two paksas is correct. I have to answer this to a group of my friends. I will be very grateful if some one can solve this puzzle for me?
