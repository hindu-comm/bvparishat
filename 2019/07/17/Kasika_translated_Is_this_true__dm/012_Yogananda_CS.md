Namaste,

  

Dr. Nori, to your question

one answer is to get the benefit of the studies done by the Pandits who didi the translation. I am motivated to give this answer, based on my familiarity with the Kannada translation commissioned by the Maharaja of Mysore between 1945-62, approximately. It is a magnificent work, bringing together and critically commenting on the work related to it done upto the contemporary times. There are serious plans to open this source to wider public by commissioning a translation into English.

  

Dr. Galstian, a Kannada translation of the entire Krishna Yajurveda has been underaken byJyoti SamskritikaPrathishthana, Bangalore, and they so far come out with 12 volumes; will get the details later. I would certainly help with material from the Kannada translation wehever required.

  

regards......yoga
