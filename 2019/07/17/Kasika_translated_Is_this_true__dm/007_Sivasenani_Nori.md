I hope you do not mind my curiosity. Why go the length of learning Kannada, when the Sanskrit of Sayana is not particularly difficult? Anyhow, in most cases only the verbs and vibhakti pratyayas are translated, the substantives tend to be used in the same form (tatsama words). Also, the technical sections like derivation of words (offered when words are encountered the first time) are hardly more intelligible in translation than in the original. If one knows Grammar, then one gets them; otherwise not. Similarly, there are large quotations from Mimamsa, usually prefaced with 'atra asti meemaamsaa' (more so in Krishnayajurveda) where knowledge of the principles of Mimamsa is the key to proper understanding, rather than the language.

  

It is for these reasons that translations of such works are rare. If one wants to learn advanced Nuclear Physics, a Telugu translation is not of much help; it is much easier for the student to learn English.
