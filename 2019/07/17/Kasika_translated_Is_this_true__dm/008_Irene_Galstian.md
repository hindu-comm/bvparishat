DearN Siva Senani,

  

Of course, his writing isn’t much more or less convoluted than anyone else’s, it’s the mimamsa bits. Depending on how helpful the translator decided to be, a translation could be useful. To find out for myself, I’ve asked the list about the existing translations.

What strategy would you suggest?

  

Best wishes,

Irene
