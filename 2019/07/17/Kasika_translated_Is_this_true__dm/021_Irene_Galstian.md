Namaste Venkatesh Murthy,  
I wonder if they can be contacted in any way other than knocking on  
their door. I'd be interested in buying the available volumes and  
scanning them for the perusal of the list, assuming everyone's  
conscience agrees that if they read the scans a lot, they'd try to buy  
the books in the interests of supporting the people who work on the  
translation.
