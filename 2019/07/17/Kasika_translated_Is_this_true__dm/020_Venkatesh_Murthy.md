Namaste

  

I think this is the same place in Bangalore near Sringeri Math. There is a house on the road behind it. You have to go down the steps to the house. If you go in the evening you can hear Yajur Veda chanting coming from the surroundings. There is a fierce dog chained near the door but it will not bite you if you do not go near it. Then you enter into the house verandah and ask for Yajur Veda Kannada translation. They will bring out the book and give itto you and collect the money for it.
