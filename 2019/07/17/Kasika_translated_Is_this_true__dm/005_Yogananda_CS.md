Namaste,

  

The last Maharaja of Mysore, Sri Jayachamaraja Wodeyar arranged for a translation of the complete Rigveda Samhita and Aitareya brahmana into Kannada along with an exhaustive commentary discussing all aspects, including translations into English by scholars Wilson, Maxmuller, . . . . It is in 36 volumes, the last one being the index of all words in Rigveda; total number of pages is about 32000. I will send the link to a hyperlinked digital edition soon.

  

Regards. . . . . Yoga
