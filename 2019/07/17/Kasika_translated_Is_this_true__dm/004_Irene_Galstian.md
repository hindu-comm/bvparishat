Thank you, Harshvadan Trivedi, for this additional information. I  
managed to find PDFs of the 10 volume set - this is very useful.  
  
Not sure if it's best to make a new thread for the next set of  
questions, but I'll ask them here and make a new thread if there are  
objections.  
  
For a while now I've been looking for a translation of Sayana.  
Preferably of Yajurveda, but beggars can't be choosers. A friend once  
told me that there exists a full translation of Rgveda Bhasya into  
Kannada, but I'm not sure if I recall this correctly. Anyway, I've  
reached the point that I'll sit and learn enough Kannada if that's the  
only available way forward; sometimes what seems a long way turns out  
to be the shortest. Please could you say into which languages have you  
seen Sayana translated. Just to be clear, I'm not talking about small  
bits and pieces like the Rgveda/Yajurveda intro or loose paraphrases.  
  
If it turns out that the Kannada translation exists and nothing easier  
is available, my next questions are:  
1. Where could I find a suitably made Kannada translation of a text I  
already know, e.g. Paspasahnika or something I could use as a parallel  
text to pick up Kannada?  
2. Which grammar would you recommend to look things up?  
  
Thank you,  
Irene
