Prof. Yogananda

  

Please allow me to add nuance to my stance. Do I believe that translations of deep texts are utterly (atyanta) useless? No. For someone who already knows Kannada, these translations are indeed very useful. But if one ought to learn Kannada to read the translation, then the barrier for the benefit to be derived has to be pretty high. Vinoba Bhave's remark that he wants to learn Telugu to read the Bhagavatam of Potana comes to my mind in this context. This work of translation must indeed be one such, given the weight of the vaakya of an aapta like you. So, Dr. @Galastian, on the strength of the testimony of Prof. Yogananda, I must urge you to be open-minded.

  

Regards

Senani
