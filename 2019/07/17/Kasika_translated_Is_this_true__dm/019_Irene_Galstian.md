Sivasenani Nori, thank you for your advice, I received it in the spirit given.  
My impression so far is that learning Kannada would be useful for  
other reasons as well, not just for the purposes of the present  
thread. Nothing is on fire, and reading Kannada with understanding  
will also come, just like the previous 11 languages came, gradually  
and joyfully. This thread turned up additional interesting information  
on the Yajurveda translation in progress. I hope more on this will be  
forthcoming.
