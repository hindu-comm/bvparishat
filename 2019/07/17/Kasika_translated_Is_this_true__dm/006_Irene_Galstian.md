Thank you, Yoga, this is wonderful news already.  
  
How are things with Yajurveda bhasya? Have you come across any  
complete or near-complete translations?  
  
Also, if you read Kannada, I'd be grateful for your replies to the  
Kannada-related questions in the post, but maybe it's best if we  
discuss it privately, since the rest of the list probably wouldn't be  
interested in this.  
  
In the meantime, I've received several private messages about this  
post, one of which informed me that Rgveda bhasya also exists in  
Hindi, done by Bhismadatta Sarma. Apparently it's a 5 or 6 volume set.
