Sharing an article just uploaded by Prof. Jan E M Houben.

  

List members may remember my previous posts comparing Bhatrhari's view with that of Cognitive Linguists.

  

Prof. Houben takes a balanced view by not insisting that that is the only view one could take with regard to Vakyapadiyam.

  

Conclusion: Bhartrhari as a cognitive linguist



According to an image with which Bhartrhari was familiar, the perception

of a crystal is greatly influenced by the background, e.g., a white or red

flower (VP 3.3.40-41). This applies to Bhartrhari's theory of language as

well: it appears different depending on the (theoretical) background against

which one places it. The change of season in the linguistic research program

of which we are currently perceiving the first signs, from transformational

generative to cognitive and constructive, from top-down to bottom up, from

reductive to non-reductive, could very well turn out to be inspiring and

clarifying for the study of Bhartrhari (as cognitive linguist) as well as for the

study of Päninian grammar (as construction grammar). If the theories and

methods which we bring with us when we approach an ancient discipline is

anywhere of crucial and pervading importance it is in grammar. Modern

cognitive linguists and construction grammarians, on their part, may find

to their surprise an extensive amount of investigations in Bhartrhari's work

and in the Bhartrharian way of Päninian grammar that directly pertain to

basic issues in their research program. A rapproachement between

Bhartrhari studies and cognitive linguistics is therefore expected to be most

fruitful and stimulating for both parties.
