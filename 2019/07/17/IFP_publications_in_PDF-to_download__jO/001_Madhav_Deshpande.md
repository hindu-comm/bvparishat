Dear Shri Narenthiran,

  

  Thanks for informing about this wonderful facility. I would like to point out one glitch. The download link for the 3rd volume of Rauravāgama takes you to the pdf of the 2nd volume. Please see if this can be corrected, and inform us of the corrected link. With best regards,
