Thank you so much for the information. I read it a long time ago and hence could only guess that it must have been Manusmriti.

The relevant shloka is:

  

**मूत्रोच्चारसमुत्सर्गं दिवा कुर्यादुदङ्मुखः। दक्षिणाभिमुखो रात्रौ संध्ययोश्च तथा दिवा॥50॥ (मनुस्मृति, अ॰4)**

  

Here, the idea is to keep the sun to the right side. The idea in the Talmudic text is different.

  

Best regards

Narayan Prasad
