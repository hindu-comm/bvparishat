Thank you so much, Dr Irene Galstian, for pointing out the original source language.

Actually in my initial posting attachment, the source has been indicated in the right margin as: "(17) Ex Barajetha in Massech. Berachos, fol. 62, apud Lent, pag.10".

  

\<\<Does that matter for your purposes?>\>

  

I was very much interested in knowing the original source language. So the information given by you is important for me.

Thanks again.

  

Best regards.

Narayan Prasad
