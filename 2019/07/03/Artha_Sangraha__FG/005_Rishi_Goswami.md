Dhanyavadah Sri Sivasenaniji.  
I'm very thankful for you suggested the book and apologize for delayed reply.  
Yes it's difficult to know about Yajnas, but there are few somayajis in South and few in Maharashtra as well. Maybe they might be knowing about it.

Chetanji, I xeroxed a book, Rajivollasa commentary on Dinakari Tika, I'm not sure if it's available online as I couldn't find it.

I'm not sure if Tatacharyaji has written Tika on Meemamsa as well.

I'll surely upload it once I find the pdf.
