Sri Rishi Goswami

  

The Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan has brought out an edition of Artha Sangraha with the commentary मीमांसार्थसंग्रहकौमुदी of Swami Rameshwara Bhikshu which is succinct and lucid. If you are studying this for the first time, this would be a good entry point.

  

Usually, one would become curious about the various angas of different Yajnas while reading the examples and these are best learnt from other sources as one can get lost in those details. This is a necessary cost as we are no longer familiar with the intricate details of how to perform a Yajna and yet the principles elucidated in Meemaamsaa are illustrated and explained by those very details.
