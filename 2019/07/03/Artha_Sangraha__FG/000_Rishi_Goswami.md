Namo Vidvadbhyah.

I am wishing to start Artha Sangraha soon. I'm unaware of anything in Meemamsa, but will want to know about it. I'm in search of a good Tika on it.

Like for eg, the Tarka Sangraha Sarvasvam and Nyaya Bodhini Vishyamala were the two Best Tikas available and I would suggest to anybody who asked.

Sometimes, the Popular ones are the most recommended ones and sometimes there are Sub-commantaries which are less famous. Like Rajivollasa by Shri Ramanuja Tatacharya is one of the best (less famous) commantaries on the world famous Dinakari.

I would like to know some good Tikas/Subtikas on Artha Sangraha for help in studies.

Pranamami  
Regards  
Rishi.
