Dear scholars,

I am looking for two missing pages (18 and 19) of the above mentioned work.

I have a scan from [archive.org](http://archive.org) or jainaelibrary (I am not sure).

That has these two pages missing.

If anyone of you who has access to another version of scanned copy or physical copy can pass these two pages to me, I would be grateful.
