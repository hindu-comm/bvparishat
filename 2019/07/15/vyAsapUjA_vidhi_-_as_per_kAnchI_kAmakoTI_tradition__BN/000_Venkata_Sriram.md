...........

  

This puja vidhi is as per the Kanchi Kamakoti Tradition and would be useful for those who follow that parampara.

  

The rituals are very elaborate and the purpose is for those yatis / sanyasis who are taking chaturmAsya vrata tomorrow.

  

Otherwise, for people like us, chanting of guru-parampara-stotra, vyasa ashtottara and vishnu sahasranama is

recommended.

  

  

rgs,

sriram
