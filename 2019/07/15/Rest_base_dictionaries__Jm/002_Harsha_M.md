Thanks a lot श्रीमद्विश्वास महोदयः

  

This is a wonderful utility. Should be very grateful to whoever designed and hosting it in their servers.

  

I am trying to caeate a flow-db for a tensorflow based string NLP processor that I am developing myself to learn both NLP and Sanskrit together.

  

If there are anybody who is interested or has done such activity earlier, please contact me.

  

Thanks and Regards,

Harsha
