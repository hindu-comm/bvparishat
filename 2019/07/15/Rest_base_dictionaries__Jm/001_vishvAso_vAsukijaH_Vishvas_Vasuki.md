There is an obsolete unmaintained effort, which still works (not sure for how long): <https://github.com/indic-dict/dict-api>
-<http://vedavaapi.org:5984/dict_entries/_design/index_headwords/_view/index_headwords?limit=10&reduce=false&inclusive_end=true&include_docs=true&start_key=%22%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%9F%E0%A4%BF%22>

Alternatively, you can use sanskrit wiktionary api (contents there also are a bit obsolete and unmaintained).
