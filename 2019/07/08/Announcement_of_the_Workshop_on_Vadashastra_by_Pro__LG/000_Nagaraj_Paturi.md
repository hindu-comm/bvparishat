A Course on Vādaṥāstra (Theory and Practice of Debate)

Concept Note

Vāda is a a category in Indian Philosophy which involves theory and practice of intellectual debates, dialogues and discussions. It is because of vāda that cultures and civilizations have thrived and great intellectual achievements could be made. Vāda promotes diversity and pluralism and inculcates democratic values. No vāda is possible if there is only one point of view, it always pre-requisites the other; and mostly promotes the presence of many others. India’s History of Ideas and debates presents a multi-linear view. Saṃvāda (dialogue, correspondence) and vivāda (difference) are two faces of Vāda.

This course will be based on Sanskrit- based knowledge systems (the śāstras) and lectures will be given through power point presentation.
