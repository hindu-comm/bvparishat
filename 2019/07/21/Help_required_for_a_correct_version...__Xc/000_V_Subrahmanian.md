Namaste

  

The following mantra, apparently from the Atharva Veda, is a favorite of many as suitable to be printed on the wedding invitation card. Could anyone please say if this version is free of errors?  

  

इहेमाविन्द्रसं नुद चक्रवाकेव दम्पती । प्रजयौनौ स्वस्तकौ विस्वमायुर्व्यऽशनुताम् ॥  

  

O Lord Indra! May you bring together this newly married couple in the same manner as a pair of chakravaka birds; let them enjoy marital bliss, and along with their progeny, live a full life.  

  

Thanks and regards
