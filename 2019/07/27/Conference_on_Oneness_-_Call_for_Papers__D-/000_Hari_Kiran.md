Dear All,

  

I am happy to announce the Call for Papers for the Conference on Oneness to be held in India in October. The date and venue are to be finalised.

  

Our Director Dr Nagaraj Paturi has written a detailed note outlining the various themes that are proposed to be dealt with in this unique conference.

  

I would urge all of the venerable intellectuals in this group to bless this event and participate as speakers.

  

Please also share this brochure amongst your colleagues and other groups who may be interested.

  

The exact date and venue will be finalised shortly. Meanwhile abstracts can be sent to [nam...@indica.org.in]()

  

Looking forward

  

Regards

  

Hari
