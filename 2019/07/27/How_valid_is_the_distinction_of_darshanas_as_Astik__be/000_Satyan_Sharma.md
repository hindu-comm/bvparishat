Namaste

  

According to the dictionary Vācaspatyam (entries on Āstika and Nāstika), Āstika is the one who believes in the existence of paraloka, while the Nāstika is the one who believes in the nonexistence of paraloka, of Īśvara and adṛṣṭa. If these definitions are true, then the Sāṅkhya of Īśvarakṛṣṇa in the Sāṅkhyakārikā (where I didn’t find any mention of an adṛṣṭa, a paraloka or even an Īśvara), should be categorised as a Nāstika darśana. It is even clearly mentioned in the text that an ānuśravika or vaidika solution to the duḥkha is impermanent, and hence arises a need for a permanent solution, which implies that the Vedas are not being thought of as infallible or ultimate. Hence on what ground are the Sāṅkhya of Īśvarakṛṣṇa or even other darśanas categorised as Āstika while the others as Nāstika?
