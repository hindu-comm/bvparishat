I am trying to understand the concept of mAtra and formulate some theories regarding this. One of the questions I have is whether words with begin with a samyutAkShara with more than three consonants. Two consonant words are fairly common like kShaya. Three consonants are also possible such as tryambaka. Is 4 or more possible? Please note I am talking about the beginning of a word.

  

Thank you.
