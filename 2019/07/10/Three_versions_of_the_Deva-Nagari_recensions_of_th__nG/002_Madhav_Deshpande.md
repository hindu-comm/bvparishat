Congratulations, dear Vasantkumar Ji. I have one general question regarding all critical editions and the regional variants. If a given regional variant has been influential in a certain region where other variants were not known, does such a regional variant attain some historical value of its own? I think this is true of the regional versions of Ramayana and Mahabharata. How true is this for the regional versions of Shakuntalam? Again I congratulate you on your accomplishments.
