Respected Scholrs,

Namaste !

In my two YouTube videos, I have discussed about the previous critical editions of the text of Devanagari recension of Kalidasa’s Abhijnana-shakuntalam. And, primary examination of the present day text ( which is commented by the commentator Raghava Bhatt ) indicates that there are multiple defects and contradictions in the stage-directions. Though there are many Critical Editions of this drama prepared by renowned scholars, but none is based on more than ten to fifteen manuscripts. Some of the modern editors have most probably consulted these printed editions only. When there are hundreds of manuscripts available in the different manuscript-libraries, we are supposed to edit the same recension again with the help of many more manuscripts. I have collected 75 manuscripts and tried to analyze them in the light of scribble errors and variants. New collation-sheets are prepared in the excel sheets of MS office program. On the basis of common errors & variants, I have classified them and infer a genealogical tree of all these 75 mss. Some remarkable information are came in to light for the first time in the history of textual criticism of the Abhijnanashakuntalam., viz. there are three versions of the Devanagari recension. (1) Longer version, which contains 42 verses in the text of third act, (2) short version of 29-30 verses, and (3) shorter / shortest version of 24 verses in the third act of the play. ( Raghava Bhatt has commented up on the last one. ) The longer version was popular in the 11^(th)century, this can be proved by some citations from Bhojaraja’s Shrigara-prakasha. Though the longer version is much more nearer to the Kashmiri recension, itexhibits some special features of it’s own also. The present research says that there should be a freshCritical edition of the Devanagari recension in the light of these new 75 ( or many more ) manuscripts.

My two YouTube videos will clarify the point in details. Interested scholars are requested to watch them & give their learned comments. Here the links:---
