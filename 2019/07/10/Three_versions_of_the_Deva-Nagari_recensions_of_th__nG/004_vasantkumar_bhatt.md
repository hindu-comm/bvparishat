Respected Professor Deshpande Ji,

namaste.

Thank for your word of appreciation and a relevant question.

 I think that so far as the texts of Sanskrit dramas are concerned,
the regional variants in stage-directions ( & mainly some interpolated scenes ) reveal the history of staging of a drama. This is the most exciting point for any researcher, who is trying to peep into the cultural changes/ spectators test in general and development of dramatic performances in particular.

So three versions of this Devnagari recension has a historical value in my view.

( for other then the dramatic text, I have also a say. But not now. )

Regards,

Vasantkumar M Bhatt
