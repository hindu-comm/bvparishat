Namaste to everyone,

  

I was thinking to get some books retyped which are avaialable on [archive.org](http://archive.org) as scanned copy as some of them are not very readable. Having them retyped will make them searchable too.

  

Does this requires approval from original publisher (Asking as books are quite old and some publishers might not be around) ? Can it be used without permission for non-commertial uses or if released back in creative common kind of license ?

  

Please let me know and if there is already any discussion or some link is known kindly let me know.

  

Thanks

Ramanuj
