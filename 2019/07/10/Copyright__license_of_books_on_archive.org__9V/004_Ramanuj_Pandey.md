Thanks for clarifying Dhaval ji and Shankara ji.

  

So what I understood now that any book published in India older than 60 years can be freely used for commercial and non commercial purposes. We can retype it using current technology keeping all the author details etc intact and can distribute freely. Please correct me if my understanding is not correct here.

  

Thanks

Ramanuj
