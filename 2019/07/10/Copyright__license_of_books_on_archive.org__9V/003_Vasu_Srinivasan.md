Reg the retyping part, you can try this ocr tool<http://ocr.sanskritdictionary.com/#>link where you can upload a screenshot of the page and it converts to devanagari text. I tried a few random books from [archive.org](http://archive.org) and if the print is legible it does a great job. If not, there will be some mistakes that can be corrected.

  

Its a trade off between retyping everything vs finding the corrections.
