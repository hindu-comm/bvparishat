Pandey ji,

  

It is not so. There are two scenarios.  

  

1\. When the copyright is with the author, 60 years period starts from the date of the author's demise. If the author of a book which was published 60 years back, passed away in the year 2000, then the copyright is valid till 2060.  

  

2\. 60 years from the date of publication can be applied only in those cases where the publishers hold the copyright.  

  

regards  
shankara
