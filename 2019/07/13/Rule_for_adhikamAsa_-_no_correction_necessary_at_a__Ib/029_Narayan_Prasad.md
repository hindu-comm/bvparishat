Dear Shri Kaul ji,  

  Namaste!

  

\<\< As far as predictive astrology is concerned, it does not appear to have been thefulcrumof our astronomical works either right from the Alpha viz. the Vedanga Jyotisham of Lagadha of 15th century BCE to Omega viz. the Siddhanta Shiromani of Bhaskarcharya of 12th century AD \>\>  

  

Here, I would like to quote two passages from the opinions of C.G. Rajan who was an expert in Astrology, Hindu Astronomy and Mathematics:

\[Ref: Saptarishi Nadi, Kataka Lagnam, Madras Government Oriental Series, 1958\]

  

"The human desire to link the heavenly bodies with man so far as their effects on man were concerned, has been responsible for the growth of Astronomy and for this reason, Astrology is very often said to be the Nursing-Mother or Foster-Mother of Astronomy. Astrology, Astronomy and Mathematics, which is required for the growth of the first two, are sister-sciences and always go together, as if they are Triumvirates and consequently most of the eminent scientists of the mental calibre of Newton and Kepler were generally conglomerations of Mathematicians, Astronomers and Astrologers." \[Introduction, p.xxiii\]  
  
"If astrology is really false and if there is no truth at all in it, it would not have had its fascination and strong hold on the masses and on even many educated and cultured persons including great mathematicians, scientists, politicians, physicians, surgeons, priests, historians and philosophers from the earliest times ... Socrates, Pythagoras, Aristotle, Plato, Porphyry and Hippocrates, the Father of Medicine, were all believers in the doctrines of astrology." \[Introduction, p.xxxi\]  
  
Best regards  
Narayan Prasad
