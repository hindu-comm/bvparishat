Namaste.

If the luni-solar Hindu calendar is to be continued, a better option to restrict the Hindu festivals to the required seasons, would be to dispense with an अधिकमास in about 2000 years.

Erroneous judgement to see relative movement between seasons (say, solstices) and mAsa-s of panchAnga as a defect:  
In reality this "defect" is deliberate and lets the logic of yuga-s (kali etc) work out within the panchanga framework.  
  
It is no coincidence that during Mahabharata (start of kali) winter-solstice occurred in the mid of kumbha (i.e. on average at the start of mAgha).  
  
mAgha is no ordinary mAsa and the start of the present kali is linked to WS in mAgha. In fact mAgha in Hindu panchAnga has some invariant properties that help us identify even the nakshatra (hence rAshi) framework changes over really long periods of time.  
  
The problem is, such intricate subjects cannot be done justice with in decrepit Indian University system, or for that matter committees lorded by comrades.  
  
And I don't see BVP as a right platform either.
