Dear Narayan Prasadji,

Jai Shri Ram!

Thank you for initiating discussion on the ticklish topic of adhika/kshya-masa!

*Adhikamasa*is a phenomenon recorded in the earliest Veda viz. theRig-Veda 1/25/8 which reads/says

वेदमासो धृत व्रतो द्वादश प्रजावतः \| वेदा य उपजायते

"Varuna knows the twelve months; (and) the animals created during that period; (and the thirteenthintercalary month) which is created near the twelve months" (S B Dikshit's translation)

Thus there are supposed to be occasionally thirteen lunar months vis-a-vis the twelve solar months of a (solar) year.

This thirteenth (adhika) lunar month was known as मलिम्लुच: and अम्हस्पतिः as per Vajasneya Samhita 7/30 and 2/30-31.

Now the question arises as to what type of lunar month was adhika/kshaya vis-a-vis its solar counterpart and what type of month was the latter one .

Unlike a solar year there is no lunar year in a proper sense.

A synodic month from New Moon to New Moon (Amanta to Amanta) is usually taken into account for calculating an adhika (excess) or Kshyya (decayed) month.

The solar year as per the entire Vedic lore is seasonal which meansthat it has to be inexorably connected to the seasons.

Thus a solar year of twelve solar months comprises six seasons.

The Vedas declare in quite an unambiguous manner that a (Vedic solar) year has no existence unless it is supported by seasons

ऋतुभिर्हि संवत्सरः शक्नोति स्थातुं (शतपथ ब्राह्मण 8/7/1/8)

एकं वा एतद्देवानामहः \|\| यत्संवत्सरः \|\| (तै. ब्रा. 3.9.22)

As per the attachment RV02, a Vedic year consists of 12 months which are made of five seasons (six seasons actually, but the commentator Acharya Sayana has clarified that Hemanta and Shishira have been clubbed together, and as such only five seasons have been talked about) (Attachment RV1)

Lal Bahadur Shastri Samskrit Vidyalaya, Delhi, have published the first Mandala of the Rig Veda, with the commentary by well known Vedic scholars Acharya Shivraj Jharkhandi and Aahitagni Shastri.

They have given a detailed explanation of the above quoted mantra of the Rig-Veda about Adhika-masa in the following words

साल के बारह महीने और बारह महीनों की प्रजा अर्थात दिन, घटी , पल और विपल
वरुण जानते हैं \| तेरह महीने भी होते हैं क्यूंकि चान्द्रमास अर्थात अमावस्या का समय (२९ दिन १२ घंटा ४४ मिनट३सेकण्ड काहोता है और इसका बारह गुणा करने से साल ३५४ दिन ८ घंटे ४८ मिनट 36 सेकण्ड का होगा \| परन्तु सूर्य का सौर वर्ष (**सायन मेष राशि से चल कर पुनः सायन मेष राशि पर आने तक**)३६५ दिन ५ घंटे ४८ मिनट ३५ सेकंड का होता है \| इससे प्रति वर्ष १० दिन २१  घंटे ११ सेका अंतर आता है \| इस लिए ३ वर्षों मैं एक मॉस बड़ा कर सौर और चंद्र वर्षों का मेल करते हैं।। यही तेरहवां महीना है जिसको वरुण जानते हैं।

(Here I have made some minor changes in the duration given by the commentators. I have given the difference in mean duration, though these days adhika-mas is decided on the basis of Apparent longitudes of the sun and the moon. But in ancient Vedic days, only mean longitudes were followed, and even those were not very correct).

However, what is to be noted here is that the commentators have mentioned specifically ''A solar year ranges from one **SAYANAMesha RASHI/SAMKRANTI to the next SAYANA** Mesha Rashi Samkranti "

This translation was done by them about a hundred years back when there was no nirayana-sayana controversy!

(Pl. see RV01 attachment)

As afurther demonstration of the same, the earliest indigenous astronomical work viz. the Vedanga Jyotisham of 15th century BCE has made a solar year start/range between two Udagayanas i.e. the two Winter Solstices. And as calculation of an exact solar month was next to impossible in that hoary past, Acharya Lagadhs has advised to add two intercalary (lunar) months after every thirty (seasonal solar) months in a five year yuga of sixty (seasonal) months.

I can declare it with all the emphasis at my command that none of the Vedas or the Vedangas touched any niraayana (what is euphemistically known as sidereal) year even with a barge pole!

I am sure none of the scholars of this august forum will disagree with me on either of these points!

Thus we have to commence a new solar year from either of the Solstices (Either Uttarayana or Dakshinayana) or Equinoxes (Either Vasanta Sampat or Sharat Sampat) if we really want to follow the Vedic lore in letter and spirit. And we must adjust all the synodic lunar months accordingly vis-a-vis Madhu, Madhava etc. solar months.

I must put on record here that the Vedic solar months also were/are named Madhu, Madhava etc.

And the Vedas tell us मधुश्च माधवश्च वासन्तिकावृतूand so on.

As per the attachment Madhu-Madhava-lunr months, it is clear that lunar Madhu, Madhava etc. months have to be adjusted against and correlated with seasonal solar Madhu, Madhava etc. months.

We cannot wish them away, howsoever hard we may try!

Unless we do so immediately, we will continue to follow adharma in the name of "sidereal calendar"!  

What pains me is that Vaishakhi, the new solar year that we are celebrating on 15th of April these days, has absolutely no sanction, I REPEAT ABSOLUTELY NO SANCTION, from any shastra! It is not connected with any star either, nor is it based on any siddhanta, including the Surya Siddhanta nor any Purana, whether Srimad Bhagvata or Vishnu Purana or Shiva Purana or Vishnudharmotara Purana and so on!

What pains me to see is that even the well-read Vedic scholars of this august forum are taking such a lacunae lightly!

The long and short of this mail is

NIRAYANA IS REALLY NIRADHAAR---IT HAS NOT EVEN ASTRONOMICAL SANCTION, LET ALONE THE SANCTION FROM ANY OF THE VEDAS OR THE VEDANGAS OR PURANAS OR SIDDDHANTS!

IT HAS TO BE DISCARDED IMMEDIATELY!

शुभस्य शीघ्रं \|

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!
