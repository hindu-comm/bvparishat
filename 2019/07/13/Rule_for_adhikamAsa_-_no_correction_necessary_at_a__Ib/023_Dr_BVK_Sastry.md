Namaste



1. Good to know that you are \< more of a traditionalist than a reformist, much less a renegade. \> and you are also a \< publishing own panchanga> .





2. Good to know that your \< predictions proven correct> you were awarded \< Nostradamus award ...> . That is not the logical basis to establish the science of Vedanga Jyotisha. One needs to discover/ Vision the Universal law . The validity of vijnana is two ways: Explain the phenomenon and events of past by time ( Bhoota- kaala darshana/ The rear view mirror). And see through the time in future ( Bhavishyat Kaala darshana/ The front wind shield through which one has to see for driving forward) and track them. Many people claim the validity for
Bhavishyat based on their ability to look at the past. This is the trap of many renowned astrologers. The claim for seeing - future
because they were able to analyze the past ! The two skills of seeing the Time in backwards unwinding and forward revealing are different, by skills, ganitha, yoga. The jyotishi who ends with a past analyst skill and reputation is a ' post-mortem surgeon' working on a dead body. The jyotishi who desires to work and guide for a better future needs past analysis and anlyst; but has to go far beyond to integrate the present and future ; this is a skill, intuition and certainly a 'ganitha' involved too much. The reputation of a Jyotishi who works on this line takes time to get validated . Such a person is like a Olympics coach and doctor for an olympics athlete. They have to work with live bodies, forces and ' Ishwara- anugraha'. The real tragedy is ' India has many Jyotishis who live by 'post-mortem model glory' and less by 'Vedanga - Jyotir-yoga' standards. The fight on ganitha and panchanga will simply disapper if ' one as a practicing Jyotishi' can see the ' Samvatsara chakra - as Kaala-gati' in ones own body, breath and thought ( Shareeram Vishwam; Shareera graha-nakshatra mandalam; surya atmaa- Manah chandrah- nakshatraani roopam). This is when astrologer becomes a Jyotiryogi. then this debate on panchanga is meaningless . Your own body tells you which is the right pancha-anga that is working for you and the query maker. Why ? That opens the door to the understanding of Gita (11-32) - Kalosmi - I am the TIME ; and Vishwaroopa darshana when ' Shashi is told as a Nakshatra ( nakshatraanaam aham shashi - Gita 10-21); No Panchanga in the tradition works on this Gita sloka. Again, we talk so much of 'dwadasha -aadityas' but show me one Panchanga which has shown more than one Surya ?? But, when it comes to Prashna, the lagna ( time of query), the Manas (chandra, chandra nakshatra) from drik or valya works beautifully ! How ? Why ? When it comes to muhurtha, Surya in uccha / Ekadasha by vaky or drik works good. Why ?





I hope i have made a pointer for your further thought, to explore where 'Panchaga ganitha stops' and 'Vedanga jyotisha stops'.
