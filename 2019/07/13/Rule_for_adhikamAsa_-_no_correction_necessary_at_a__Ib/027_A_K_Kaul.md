Respected Dr. BVK Sastry,  

Jai Shri Ram!

Many thanks for your prompt response.

\<Good to know that your \< predictions proven correct> you were awarded \< Nostradamus award ...> . That is not the logical basis to establish the science of Vedanga Jyotisha. One needs to discover/ Vision the Universal law . The validity of vijnana is two ways: Explain the phenomenon and events of past by time ( Bhoota- kaala darshana/ The rear view mirror). And see through the time in future ( Bhavishyat Kaala darshana/ The front wind shield through which one has to see for driving forward) and track them. Many people claim the validity for
Bhavishyat based on their ability to look at the past. This is the trap of many renowned astrologers. The claim for seeing - future
because they were able to analyze the past ! The two skills of seeing the Time in backwards unwinding and forward revealing are different, by skills, ganitha, yoga. The jyotishi who ends with a past analyst skill and reputation is a ' post-mortem surgeon' working on a dead body. The jyotishi who desires to work and guide for a better future needs past analysis and anlyst; but has to go far beyond to integrate the present and future ; this is a skill, intuition and certainly a 'ganitha' involved too much. The reputation of a Jyotishi who works on this line takes time to get validated . Such a person is like a Olympics coach and doctor for an olympics athlete. They have to work with live bodies, forces and ' Ishwara- anugraha'. The real tragedy is ' India has many Jyotishis who live by 'post-mortem model glory' and less by 'Vedanga - Jyotir-yoga' standards. \>

As far as predictive astrology is concerned, it does not appear to have been the fulcrum of our astronomical works either right from the Alpha viz. the Vedanga Jyotisham of Lagadha of 15th century BCE to Omega viz. the Siddhanta Shiromani of Bhaskarcharya of 12th century AD on the basis of which we decide our festivals and muhurtas etc.

This is clear from the two attachments VJ-jyotisham, a page from the VJ, which states

quote

The Vedas have indeed been revealed for the sake of performance of sacrifices. These sacrifices are dependent on various segments of time. Therefore, only he who knows the lore of time, viz. jyotisham, understands the performance of sacrifices. (Dr. KV Sarma translation)

Similarly, Bhaskaracharya-II also seems to be exactly echoing the VJ with the following words

वेदस्तावद्यज्ञ कर्म प्रवृत्ताःयज्ञा: प्रोक्तास्तु ते कालाश्रयेन\|\| शास्त्रादस्मात् कालबोधो यतः स्यत् वेदाङ्गत्वं ज्योतिषस्योक्तमस्मात् \|\|

Here Bhaskaracharya has emphasized that since the jyotisha shastra is meant for deciding the proper timings for yajnyas, that is why it is known as a Vedanga!

(P. see attachments VJ-Jyotisham and Bhaskaracharya-Jyotish)

That is why I had said that predictive astrology is neither Vedic, nor Pauranik, nor sidhantic nor even scientific! On the other hand, according to Swami Dayanada Saraswati, an extraordinary scholar of the Vedic lore, predictive astrology is meant only to make a fool of a common man!

The main topic of this discussion being the "Calendar reform", I had requested you to let me have your views about the niraadhar Lahiri Ayanmasha Pnahcnagas (and the SS Panchanga of BHU etc.) which are being followed by about 90 per cent of the Hindus. I have yet to have any response from you.

For your kind information, the two attachments "VKS-Rashi1 and VKSRashi-2" are a commentary on III/23-25 of Panchasiddhantika by one of the most reputed astronomers of Kerala viz. Dr. K V Sarma.

He has thundered

Quote

"At the first point of Mesha and Tula are the spring and autumnal equinoxes (and the sacred days thereof are when the Sun is there).

"The equinoxes i.e. the points of intersection between the ecliptic and the celestial equator, though moving westward slowly along the ecliptic, were at the first point of Mesha and Tula only at the time of the author. At the present day the equinoxes have moved far into Uttara-Bhadrapada and Uttara-Phalguni, but the sacred days are still observed with the sun entering Mesha and Tula (nirayana) by blind routine....

"As the seasons depend upon the position of the mid-day sun in the sky and the length of day time, and these depend on the Sun's declination depending on tropical (sayana) longitude of the Sun, the seasonal months are different from either the solar sidereal months Mesha etc. or the synodic months Chaitra etc. and these cannot correctly represent the seasons. That is why the Vedas give a new set of months, (actually tropical months) for the seasons....This confusion has resulted in Madhu, Madhava etc. and Chaitra, Vaishakha etc. as synonyms. People who know are amused, when in the sankalpa recited for Hindu rituals the month of Vrishabha, which is advanced summer, is mentioned as spring.!

I think it is high time that scholars like you do something about rectifying the situation, as otherwise a time will come when we will be celebrating Pongal (Makar Samkranti!) on the day of Dakshinayana (around June 21,) (Karkata Samkranti) instead of Uttarayana (December 21/22) in the name of Lahiri predictive astrology and Lahiri nakshatras!

With kind regards and Jai Shri Ram!
