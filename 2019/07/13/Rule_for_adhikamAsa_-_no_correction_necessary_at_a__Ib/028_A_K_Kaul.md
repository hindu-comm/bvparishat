Dear Shri Warrier,

Jai Shri Ram!

\<Currently, many in India celebrate Uttaraayana (winter solstice) on January 14th, although the actual event is on December 21. There is thus a difference of 24 days. Does it mean that both (the actual and that which is celebrated) coincided 1693 years ago? Then it would mean that the present sidereal calendar came into existence at that time.\>  

There was never any nirayana (which is really niraadhaar!, called euphemistically as sidereal), calendar in India.

The Vedas talk of a seasonal (thus a tropical) year, the Puranas talk of a seasonal (thus a tropical) year and the siddhantas talk of a seasonal (i.e. a tropical) year.

Nirayana is thus an aberration which arose because of the mismatch between what the Surya Siddhanta and other siddhantas wanted to project but what their calculations yielded!

The Surya Siddhanta cried from housetops in its Maanadhyaya, 7th, 9th and 10th shloka

भचक्रनाभौ विषुवत् द्वितयं समसूत्रगम् \| अयन द्वितयं चैव चतस्रः प्रथितास्तु ताः \|\|

भानोर्मकर संक्रान्तेः षण्मासाः उत्तरायणम् \|\| कर्क्यादेस्तथैव स्यात् षण्मासाः दक्षिणायनं \|\|

द्विराशिमानाद् ऋतवः षडुक्ताः शिशिरादयः \|\| मेषादयो द्वादशैते मासासैस्तैरेव वत्सरः \|\|

Bapu Dev Sastri has translated these as

"In the middle of the starry sphere, the two equinoxes are diametrically opposed, so are the two solstices (in the ecliptic) those four points are very common.

"From the time of the sun's entrance into Capricorn the six solar months are the Uttarayana (the northing of the Sun): in the same manner from the time of the entrance of the Sun into Cancer, the six solar months are the Dakshinayana (the Southing of the Sun). From that time (i.e. the Winter Solstice) the periods, in each of which the Sun remains in the two signs are the seasons Shishira (the very cold season) etc. and the twelve periods in the sun remains in the 12 signs of Aries etc. are the solar months and a year is equal to the aggregate of those months."

It is quite evident from the above that the SS had never even imagined anything nirayana!

Though the Surya Siddhanta claims that it is a work that was "revealed" to Maya Mahasura at the fag end of the last kritayuga which, according to the same work was around in (3101+2019=) 5120 years of Kaliyuga+ 864000 years of Dwapara+ 1296000 years of Treta = 2165120 years back, but its calculations tell us that it is a best-fit for Shaka 444 i.e. 522 AD when its mean longitudes correspond almost exactly to the mean longitudes as per modern astronomy.

There also, it is the tropical mean longitudes and not any Lahiri or Ramana etc. longitudes. (Pl see attachment Shaka444).

That means this work (the SS) was compiled in the early centuries of CE, irrespective of what the so called Maya Mahasura has claimed!

And that is why Munjal of tenth century AD had advised in his Laghumanasa to make an addition of one arc-minute per year to the mean longitudes of the planets obtained from the Surya Siddhanta etc. works so as to make them "drik-tulya".

In around 505 AD Varahamihira had claimed in his "Panchasiddhantika" स्पष्टतरो सावित्रः" i.e the Surya Siddhanta was the most accurate (astronomical work). Exactly like the SS, VM also had said in the same Panchasiddhantika 3/26

उदगयनं मकरादावृतवः शिशिरादयश्च सूर्य वशात्। द्विभवनकाल समानं दक्षिणमयनं च कर्कटात्।।

"The sun's turning northward is when it reaches the zero point of Makara i.e. at Winter Solstice, and it's turning southwards is at the zero point of Karkata i.e. at Summer Solstice, with the attendant sacred days. The seasons Shishir etc. commence with the Winter Solstice and each season lasts two tropical months". (Translation by K V Sarma).

505 AD was 17 years before the year of the best-fit of the SS.
Therefore, the Makar Sankranti as per the calculations of (Panchasiddhantika) SS did not coincide with Uttarayana exactly.
Varahamihira started getting jittery and he exclaimed in is Brihatsamhita 3/4-5

अप्राप्य मकरमर्को विनिवृत्तो हन्ति सापरां याम्याम् \| कर्कटमसंप्राप्तो विनिवृत्तश्चोत्तरां सैन्द्रीम् \|\|  

"If the sun turns North without reaching the Makar Samkranti, it kills the people of Western and Southern directions. Similarly, without reaching Karkata, if it turns North, it destroys the people of East and Northern directions"!  

This is exactly what is happening these days! The sun is turning North i.e. it is Uttarayana (Winter Solstice!) on December 21 whereas the "almighty" Lahiri Makar Samkranti (and also the BHU Surya Siddhanti Makar Samkranti and maybe even as per "Vakya Panchangas"!) it is taking place on January 14/15----after about 24 days of Uttarayana!  

And we are celebrating such a Makar Samkranti which is supposed to be killing the inhabitants of Western and Southern directions of the country!

Similarly, the sun is turning South these days i.e. Dakshinayana (Summer Solstice) takes place on June 21 whereas the sun enters "almighty"
Lahiri Karkata Rashi and the BHU SS Karkata Rashi and also probably "Vakya-Panchanga" Karkata Rashi on July 14/15 i.e. 24 days after Dakshinayana!  

And it is supposed to be killing the inhabitants of East and Northern directions! And we are celebrating such a Karkata Samkranti.

*If VM had envisaged a so called sidereal Makar or Karkata etc. Samkrantis, he would never have expected them to coincide with Uttarayana/Dakshinayana for more than a few years and so on.*  

***Adhika-Kshyaya Masah:***

There is no separate lunar year! We subsume synodic lunar months into "almighty" Lahiri solar months. And if there are two New Moons between two "Lahiri" Samkrantis, we call it an adhikamasa. And if there is no New Moon between two "Lahiri" Samkrantis, we call it a kshyaya masa!

It is just the whim and fancy of the present Panchanga makers and has no sanction from any shastra, as repeated umpteen number of times!

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!

A K Kaul
