Dear Scholars,  

  Namaste.

  Prof. L.V.S. Mani has remarked in the footnote of his article "Intercalary (Adhika) and Decayed (Kshaya) Months" that "**the rule for determining Adhika Masa has been framed by which the lunar year is always tagged to the solar year ... the ancient Hindus have devised a method by which no correction is necessary at any future date.**"

\[Ref: The Astrological Magazine, Ed. Dr B.V. Raman, Feb.1982, p.184\]

  But since there are problems in the Hindu Luni-Solar Calendar and hence Calendar Reform Committee was set up. In this regard I would like to know comments from the specialists.

  Thanks and regards

  Narayan Prasad
