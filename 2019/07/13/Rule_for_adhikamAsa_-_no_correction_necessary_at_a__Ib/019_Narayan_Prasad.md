Dear Shri Kaul ji,  

 Namaste!

  

\<\<It is also surprising as to how these nirayana scholars claim that a lunar new year starts from Lahiri Chaitra, when right from the Surya Siddhanta to Siddhanta Shiromani, (from Alpha to Omega of Siddhantic astronomy!) all the astronomical works advise to make it start from (lunar) Madhu. The commentators right from Ranganatha to Pandit Sudhakar Dwivedi have named the same Madhu as (lunar) Chaitra. It is thus clear that because of our ignorance of the siddhantas, we are not celebrating any of the festivals whether lunar or solar, in accordance with any injunctions from the Vedic lore or Pauranic or siddhantic!\>\>

  

Then could you give reference of any articles on how to computeअधिकमास and क्षयमास from the reformed Hindu calendar you propose ?

BTW, will there be क्षयमास in the saayana luni-solar calendar ?

  

As per the sidereal lunar months I have presented the basic concepts and all the required steps how to compute these in my article in 3 installments.

In the 1stinstallment I have presented the basic concepts ofअधिकमास and क्षयमास.

In the 2nd installment I have given the table of all theअधिकमास and क्षयमासoccurring between 1800 AD and 2200 AD.

In the 3rd installment, I have presented detailed procedure how to computeअधिकमास and क्षयमास using computer. For a clear understanding of the concept, I have presented the start and end of all the Hindu months for 1982-83 AD in which bothअधिकमास and क्षयमास occurred.

  

Best regards

Narayan Prasad
