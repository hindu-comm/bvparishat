Dear Shri Kaul ji,  

   Namaste !



\<\<Quite a few of my predictions proved correct and I was awarded NOSTRADAMUSAWARD on September 3, 1995, by His Holiness Jagadguru Jayendra Saraswati of Kanchi Kamakoti, at Kanchi. It was sponsored by Express Star Teller, Chennai, and carried a cash award of Rs. 11000/- (a lot of amount in those days!), plus to and fro air ticket from Delhi to Chennai plus stay at a five star hotel there!\>\>

  

It was a pleasure to know this.

Could you please indicate whatअयनांश you used for predictive purposes?

(It is preferable to reply this query under a different subject.)

  

Best regards

Narayan Prasad
