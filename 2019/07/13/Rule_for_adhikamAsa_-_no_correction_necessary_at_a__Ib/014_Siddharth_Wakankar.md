History of Bharatiya Jyotish by S.B.Dikshit was translated into English by Shri R. V. Vaidya who worked for 22 years in the Ujjain Observatory and I think the book was published by some Govt.of India agency. I forgot its exact details.I personally knew Shri Vaidya and he has written some books in Marathi also on Hindu Sanskriti, Panchanga etc. His younger sister,son in law and other relatives were staying in Mumbai and Vadodara,but,I have lost their track now,otherwise,I could have given their contact details.

  

Best of luck in your efforts to trace the details about this book  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
