Namaste.

  

Since no comments have come up so far, I would like to mention the opinion of Pt. S.B. Dixit about a century back in his astronomical work "भारतीय ज्योतिषशास्त्राचा इतिहास". An extract from p.418 is attached herewith.

The seasons depend on the tropical year and not on sidereal year. The Roman calendar in general official use all through the world is based on tropical year. But the Hindu's calendar is based on sidereal year.

  

The mean value of tropical year in the year 2000 AD:365.242190402 mean solar days.

  

The mean value of sidereal year in the year 2000 AD:365.256363004 mean solar days.

  

(See:<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidereal_year#CITEREFIERS2014>)

  

So the difference between the two: 0.014172602 mean solar days.

Its inverse = 70.5586

  

So error of 1 day will occur in about 70.56 years and of 30 days in about 2116 years.

  

If the luni-solar Hindu calendar is to be continued, a better option to restrict the Hindu festivals to the required seasons, would be to dispense with anअधिकमास in about 2000 years.

In case of the occurrence of two अधिकमासs within 3 lunar मासs, it is better to accept only one to avoid aक्षयमास in between.

Narayan Prasad
