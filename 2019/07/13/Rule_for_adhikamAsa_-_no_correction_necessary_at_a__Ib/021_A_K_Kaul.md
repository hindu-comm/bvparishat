Respected Dr. BVKSastry,

Jai Shri Ram!

Many thanks indeed for your long and analytical response!

Obviously, it will go a long way in smoothingthe knots into which Indian astronomy/calendar has got entangled.

\<"The long short of this model of this debate seems to be challenging the vedanga Jyotisha discipline and all related professions, communities to discredit it, by attacking the tools -methods and systems used in it".\>

As already clarified several times, I am more of a traditionalist than a reformist, much less a renegade.

Whether it was phalita jyotish based on Brihat Parashari or Mansagari or even Brighu Samhita and so on, or the traditional astronomy based on Grahalaghava and Makaranda----which were supposed to be further based on the Surya Siddhanta and Aryabhatiya etc., I was a blind follower!

As there seemed to be a lot of confusion in different panchangas, I had started publishing my own panchanga under the banner "Shri Krishen Universal Ephemeris and Panchang" since 1994 both in Hindi and English, and continued it for several years.(attachment SKUE-1).

Quite a few of my predictions proved correct and I was awarded NOSTRADAMUSAWARD on September 3, 1995, by His Holiness Jagadguru Jayendra Saraswati of Kanchi Kamakoti, at Kanchi. It was sponsored by Express Star Teller, Chennai, and carried a cash award of Rs. 11000/- (a lot of amount in those days!), plus to and fro air ticket from Delhi to Chennai plus stay at a five star hotel there!

So you can rest assured that there is nothing like "discrediting the communities" much less "challenging the Vedanga-Jyotisha"!  

I may also mention here that though I am not an Arya Samajist, but having read the Satyarth Prakash of Swami Dayanand Saraswati, I got a rude shock when I came across his statement that predictive astrology is/was meant only to make a fool of a common man and "janma patrika" (जन्म पत्रिका) must be called a "shoka patrika" (शोक पत्रिका) instead!
(Attachment Dayananda-Jyotish).

And Swami Dayananda Saraswati could not be accused of being some heretic or under the influence of foreign powers to have warned about astrology like that!

Similarly, since I could not find any mention of Mesha etc Rashis in the Vedic lore available with us as on date, it is an insult to the Vedas to call predictive astrology. at least the Rashi-based astrology, as Vedic astrology, especially since there is no mention of any such practice in any of the Vedas (available as on date)! (Attachment Rashis-are-of-Greek-origin, a page from the commentary on the Vedanga Jotisha by Dr. K V Sarma, the famous scholar from Kerala).

Then again, as you claim yourself that the "astrological" planets are entirely different from astronomical planets,'Hubble telescope, NASA ephemeris based planetary positions are not a substitution or equivalent of ' Yoga-Vision', and 'vedanga jyotisha ganitha'.whichmeans we can not call predictive astrology as "scientific" either!

So predictive astrology as followed by most of us today is neither scientific nor Vedic nor as per any other shastra.

In spite of these facts, I have no right to dissuade anybody from following or practicing predictive astrology with whatever Ayanamsha or technique or Rashicha-Chakra they choose to do so.

But then we have also to safeguard our dharma from anything that is against the letter and spirit of our shastra.

*Here there is a direct conflict between the so called nirayana Rashis and our festivals like Makar Sankranti/Pongal or Chaitri Navratra etc. which scholars like you must address.*

Your another main point is  

\<The concept of ' samvatsara' in the quoted veda mantras (1/25/8)and translations of terms ' madhu, madhava, malimlucha,saha, sahasya needs reference back to Vedanga Nirukta explanations to understand and align them to the use in vedanga Jyotisha tradition.

In his commentary on The Rigvedic mantra 1/25/8

वेद मासो दृत व्रतः द्वादश प्रजावतः। वेदा य उपजायते।।

Acharya Sayana also has confirmed that this mantra is talking about an adhika-masa. (Attachment RV Adhikamasa). He has taken recourse to Panini and Nirukta etc. in arriving at this conclusion.

**3a**. **Preference to align X-ian business calendar dates to different dates in traditional panchanga for a social convenience:**
Where then is the difficulty of modern researchers and critics in understanding the traditional thought? It is in an effort to align the 'vedanga Jyotisha- Ganita/ panchanga' (used for Veda-Dharma practice)
to the historical alien model of Gregorian calendar used for business The Gregorian calendar is the calendar used in most of the present world. It is named after Pope Gregory XIII, who introduced it in October 1582. The calendar spaces leap years to make the average year 365.2425 days long, approximating the 365.2422-day tropical year that is determined by the Earth's revolution around the Sun. The history of Gregorian calendar goes back to Roman Republic and the Roman Empire
and Julian calendar, which began in 45 BC, There was no discontinuity in the cycle of weekdays or of the Anno Domini calendar era. The reform also altered the lunar cycle used by the Church to calculate the date for Easter (computus), restoring it to the time of the year as originally celebrated by the early Church. Due to globalization in the 20th century, the calendar has also been adopted by most non-Western countries for civil purposes. The calendar era carries the alternative secular name of "Common Era".  

Regardingyour above point, kindly see the clarification "The last laugh on Ayanamsha Hoax" in the attachment "julian-year-versus-VJ-Year".
There are also some clarifications about the same in the attachment "Samvatsar-11", under the para "JULIAN NEW YEAR WAS INTRODUCED ON THE BASIS OF 'VEDANGA JYOTISHA'. It is from one of the pages of my "Shri Krishen Universal Ephemeris & Panchang" for 1999.

It concludes, "Tragically, however, India got stuck with Lahiri and Rome (and the rest of the world) with Julius Caesar. Neither cared for the Vedic Uttarayana or the New Moon after that"

Thus it is an open secret that Julian calendar of 45 bc was based on the Vedanga Jyotisha of 15th century BCE

                                   
          \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

This discussion is a actually about the fact whether the panchangas we are following these days like the Rashtriya Panchang (based on "almighty" Lahiri Ayanamsha) or the ones like "Kashi Vishva Panchang" from the BHU, Varanasi, supposed to be based on the Surya Siddhanta/Makaranda with some so called beeja corrections and so on is as per our shastras or not.

We also find that some Sansthans of venerable jagadgurus are following some Vakya-panchangas.

May I ask you a simple question, sir!

Which of these Panchangas, according to you, is in accordance with the Vedic, Pauranik and siddhantic lore and how?

Since you appear to be favouring a panchanga based on "yogic intuition" instead of NASA data, that means at least the Rashtriya Panchang and all the other Panchangas based on the same are ruled out according to you.

And IMHO, at least 90 per cent Hindus of Bharata-Varsha are following Lahiri panchanga for not only predictive astrologybut all their religious festivals and muhurtas and so on.

Thus you are yourself more or less of the same view that about 90 per cent of the Hindu population is following a wrong panchang though because of different reasons.

Kindly do correct me if I am wrong.

Regarding the Vedic year vis-a-vis our shastra, I shall send you a detailed write up after hearing from you.

With kind regards and Jai Shri Ram!

A K Kaul
