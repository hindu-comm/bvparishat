Namaste



1. The exchanges in this post seem to be taking off the line of tradition; and also charging the followers of traditional texts look as 'sheep flock, making a blind following since the time of Aryabhatta' ! So may be it.



· The long short of this model of this debate seems to be
challenging the vedanga Jyotisha discipline and all related professions, communities to discredit it, by attacking the tools -methods and systems used in it.

· If really the intention is to get the stated benefits of vedanga jyotisha, and understand 'why-how' of the tradition, a different approach in education-training, study, practice, research in vedanga jyotisha in alignment with the yoga- tradition needs to be reinstated.

· Misconstruing the texts of tradition, quoting practice abuse, inappropriate pedagogy and distorted translations is not the way bring glory to the 'bhaarateeya sampradaya'.

· If we have not understood the 'sampradaya' , let us work to understand it the way it was designed and is recommended for use,
before casting aspersions and discrediting the discipline. The people of past centuries are not going to rise from grave to defend charges made on them now !

· Vedanga Jyotisha or Vedas never claimed to be the documents of season studies, rain fall, sky- objects-study. The 'Grahas- Nakshatras' of Vedanga Jyotisha are Devataas.

· They are not floating matter in void , devoid of consciousness, unconnected with any human life event, burning matter to generate light and heat, measured as

· electromagnetic energy. 

· The concept of ' samvatsara' in the quoted veda mantras (1/25/8) and translations of terms ' madhu, madhava, malimlucha,saha, sahasya needs reference back to 

Vedanga Nirukta explanations to understand and align them to the use in vedanga Jyotisha tradition. Rigveda 1-164-48 is an iconic description and NOT time specifying standard or poetry of season - phenomenon explanation. This cannot be done without a proper understanding of Paninian vedanga Vyakarana.



2. ***Defense of adhika masa / vakya panchanga - living tradition from traditional schools***: Let us look at a plausible defense model for vakya-panchanga. 



**2a**. *Vakya-*Panchanga of vakya adhika masa as a time reference - Tradition, 'Where and what is 'adharma' in vakya-panchanga ?*:* The first point for highlight here is the authority to use 'vararuchi- chandra-vakya' system for vakya panchanga; calculations provided by
Nilakantiya and continuing tradition to prepare 'vakya-panchanga'. (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandravakyas> ).



 Vararuchi, also known as vartika-kaara, a samskruth grammarian and amends provider for Panini (c. 4th century CE), is a legendary figure in the astronomical traditions of Kerala. He is credited with the authorship of the collection of Chandravākyas. Chandravākyas are a collection of numbers, arranged in the form of a list, related to the motion of the Moon in its orbit around the Earth. These numbers are couched in the katapayadi system of representation of numbers and so apparently appear like a list of words, or phrases or short sentences written in Sanskrit and hence the terminology Chandravākyas. In Sanskrit, Chandra is the Moon and vākya means a sentence. The term Chandravākyas could thus be translated as Moon-sentences. These were routinely made use of for computations of native almanacs and for predicting the position of the Moon. The work ascribed to Vararuchi is also known as Chandravākyāni, or Vararucivākyāni, or Pañcāṅgavākyāni. Madhava of Sangamagrama (c. 1350 – c. 1425), the founder of the Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics, had set forth a revised set of Chandravākyās, together with a method for computing them, in his work titled Venvaroha.



 Chandravākyas were also popular in Tamil Nadu region of South India. There, the astrologers and astronomers used these vākyās to construct almanacs. These almanacs were popularly referred to as the Vākya-pañcāṅgas. This is used in contrast to the modern mode computation of almanacs based on computation methods copied from NASA's astronomical observations which may or may not be accurate. These modern almanacs are known as Dṛk Pañcāṅgas ( or Thirukanitha Pañcāṅgas).



 Another important point is bringing the connection of vararuchi as the Samskruth grammarian and Vedaga Jyotisha tradition, the continuity of this tradition over a millennia in India . This was the time stretch when masters of tradition and vedanta acharays prevailed, and we also get the Sayana Veda-bhashya. If there had been any kind of \< variant understanding of Rigveda for panchanga purposes, failure to connect sayana and nirayana system of calculations, time deviation in observing the vratas or samskara-shraddhas according to Dharma Shastras \>, someone would have pointed out the need for correction. To make a sweeping charge that all the acharyas and communities in the long period of millennia \< followed 'adharma' in the name of sidereal calendar, which has absolutely no sanction from any shastra> is a tall claim !



**2b**. **Social usage and reference in mahabharta for adhika masa as a time reference** : Within Indian tradition, the best known ancient reference to the 'adhika-masa/ kshaya masa' calculation comes in Mahabharata, when counting of the last date for pandavas exile period was debated. (At least as the mahabharata narrative presents). From this reference positioned for 3100 BCE circa, let us jump to the vedanga jyotisha calculations in the period 1500 circa- Kelallur Nilakantha Somayaji (also referred to as Kelallur Comatiri) 14 June 1444 – 1544)
a major mathematician and astronomer of the Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics in India. One of his most influential works was the comprehensive astronomical treatise Tantrasamgraha completed in 1501. He had also composed an elaborate commentary on Aryabhatiya called the Aryabhatiya Bhasya. In this Bhasya, Nilakantha had discussed infinite series expansions of trigonometric functions and problems of algebra and spherical geometry. Grahapareeksakrama is a manual on making observations in astronomy based on instruments of the time. Known popularly as Kelallur Chomaathiri, he is considered an equal to Kottessori Parameshwaran Kundisori. (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nilakantha_Somayaji>) . The astronomy related significance of this work can be seen in Prof. Ramasubramanian's article at - <http://www.physics.iitm.ac.in/~labs/amp/kerala-astronomy.pdf> .



* ***2c**. **Why did ancient sages provide multiple siddhantas and scope for panchangas ? Were they trying to deliberately confuse posterity or we are blind to the guidance glaringly present in the tradition ?* :* The upfront statement in almost all panchangas, at least south indian ( especially from karnataka, andhra pradesh, and tamilnadu) have upfront statement indicating where to use calculation by 'surya siddhanta (Drik-ganitha/ Nirayana ) and where to use 'vakya-panchanga' calculation. The publications are very clear in recoding difference by day and time, whether it be for a major event like Yugadi, Ganesh chaturthi, Navaratri , Ramanavami, Janmashtami Or specific event like ekadashi observation, tithi for shraadha karma. 



**2d**.  Now, when vedanga jyotisha has provided 18 siddhantas and several predictive systems of 'jataka' and specific models of calculation, should we not ask a question -why so many variants ? What is the purpose ? It is here that we have a clarity from tradition. Each
panchanga is used for specific dharma -shastra related 'ritual -religiosity'. Traditional communities have no problem with the traditional panchangas !

 This is told in the most common quote, placed upfront in almost all panchangas ! ( may not be in the Indian national almanac) :

 *tithescha shriyamapnoti, vaaraat ayushya vardhanam ;*

* nakshatrat harate paapm, yogat roga-nivaranam; *

*karanaat karya samsiddhih, panchanga -phalam uttamam. *

**

* *The benefit of knowing *tithi* is for wealth gain; knowing *vaara* is for longevity knowledge; knowing *yoga* is for preparedness to take care of advent of health issues ; knowing *karana* is for success in action ; knowing *nakshatra* is for freedom from sin.



**2e**.  These five elements are deeply connected with Sun (drik-ganitha), Moon ( Vakya -siddhanta), Nakshatra ( backdrop of Sun and Moon movements), Yoga and Karana are addition subtraction derivatives related to tithi. Therefore, the panchanga system is made to provide the consolidated information on these five elements. When the vedanga information was to be a reference document for public use in community for observance of religious ceremonies, the connection of 'panchanga detail to business calendar was made as a convenience.



**2f**. The Dharma shastras provided the TIMING for
'karma-samskara observance' by soura and chandramana panchanga using
the five panchanga elements as above. They also say why a particular vedanga jyotisha-ganitha based panchanga is to be used for different karmas. This is a part of the vedanga-jyotisha diagnostics of the problems of the seeker. This is where one finds the detailing of graha-kaarakatva ( as sun is for Atmaa, Father ; Moon is for Manas ; guru is for santaana and the like). I am still seeking someone, knowledgeable about tradition to explain me what makes a ' Souramana Ekadashi' observance different from 'Chandramana Ekadashi tithi' , even if it is in term of ' punya-phala'. I have not been find someone who can provide the rationale and mystic of Dharma (Yoga) shastra. This is not simply showing the ' difference in day-time to begin and end ekadashi' - in relation to a business calendar like gregorian or a shaka calendar or a specific religious institution panchanga publication. 



**2g**. There is a clear difference in the movement of sun and moon; The two models of soura and chandramana panchagnas can stand independent and on their own feet, without recourse to the other! The sun-moon movements are going on independently in the sky and universe. The panchanga kartaa provides a localized reference pointing to the periodic crisscross of the two calculations, for a convenience. Adhika maasa / kshaya maasa is the presence or absence of this overlapping crisscross period. This practice of documenting soura and chandramaana as separate publications was / is seen in some panchangas of karnataka . The pages of vakya and drik are placed in independent sections, even when the book is one; the nirayana degree calculation chart is placed in an independent section. In short, the panchanga, as a printed document is a conglomeration of calculations arrived at placed as data from various rules ; and the practicing vedanga jyotishi / counseling dharmashastra guide/ the purohita is supposed to know which section to use for what purpose.



**2h**.  The panchanga document does not venture to explain the 'why difference between two systems'? . The answers for this question is to be looked at in 'Dharma Shastra' design which recommends the observance of ' karma' in an appropriate time, using which system and why. The Dharma shastra provides the basis for the 'TIME -EVENT OBSERVANCE- BEENFIT'. Example . Why bhadrapada shuddha chauti observance of ganesha vrata is special compared ot sankashti on chaturthee in the dark half of the chandramaana maasa. Why mahashivaratri is different fom maasa-shivaratri. 



**2i**. The Vedanga Jytoisha based Panchanga provides the 'KAALA-GANITHA'. The 'KARMA-KANDA' provides the ' METHOD AND SYSTEMS (Vidhi-Vidhana OF PERFORMING KARMA'. The Vedas provide the 'MANTRA' to be used. The ' PURO-HITA/ Acharya guides the conducts the Karma ( aachaaryavaan purusho veda). This model of integrated vedanga jyotisha education, along with Yoga and Samskrutham, the lifestyle training and disciple to be professional of vendaga jyotisha is endangered in the current period. The reason is lack of proper community education on Why-When of Dharma /Karma observances, the hype claims of some jyotish practitioners, the inappropriate translations and partial interpretation of the source works in the name of academic research. 



**3**. ***Why is the difficulty of modern researchers in understanding the multiple panchangas ? and what may be the likely reason ?***:



**3a**.  **Preference to align X-ian business calendar dates to different dates in traditional panchanga for a social convenience:**
Where then is the difficulty of modern researchers and critics in understanding the traditional thought? It is in an effort to align the 'vedanga Jyotisha- Ganita/ panchanga' (used for Veda-Dharma practice)
to the historical alien model of Gregorian calendar used for business The Gregorian calendar is the calendar used in most of the present world. It is named after Pope Gregory XIII, who introduced it in October 1582. The calendar spaces leap years to make the average year 365.2425 days long, approximating the 365.2422-day tropical year that is determined by the Earth's revolution around the Sun. The history of Gregorian calendar goes back to Roman Republic and the Roman Empire
and Julian calendar, which began in 45 BC, There was no discontinuity in the cycle of weekdays or of the Anno Domini calendar era. The reform also altered the lunar cycle used by the Church to calculate the date for Easter (computus), restoring it to the time of the year as originally celebrated by the early Church. Due to globalization in the 20th century, the calendar has also been adopted by most non-Western countries for civil purposes. The calendar era carries the alternative secular name of "Common Era". (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar>)!



**3b**.  The vedanga jyotisha calendar (chandramana, souramana, barhaspatymana, Nakshatra maana..) did not think of aligning their calculations to any social historical calendar - of shaka model or historical reference like Gregorian calendar ! Vedanga jytoisha identified the sky-map positions and visioned the ' AUSPICIOUSNESS OF TIME' (Shubha-labha muhurta) for a given location. The Geo-locale identity and Skymap graha-position, the measures of observed relational movements/ position of sun and moon in the backdrop of bha-chakra ( ecliptic) was used to measure the 'AUSPICIOUS NATURE OF TIME', down to the level of *ghati-vighati* units. The time measure is indicated in five units: Tithi, vara( based on Hora), nakshatra, yoga, karana. Each of these elements has a specific benefit, as noted above. This part is not examined seriously and objectively by science research; nay it is pushed out as 'superstition, tribal practice belief, palcebo-practices, con-arts'. 



**4**. I conclude my post with a request. 'Hubble telescope, NASA ephemeris based planetary positions are not a substitution or equivalent of ' Yoga-Vision', and 'vedanga jyotisha ganitha'. Let us work together to understand the tradition and see how best the axiomatic benefits stated from vedanga jyotisha studies can be realized. Negative commenting and rejection of tradition is not going to bring any good outcome. If we love and respect our inheritance, let us put our time and effort to research the tradition. If this is not our interest, pride or useful for our life, let us do serious research to disprove veda- vedanga system in an objective scientific way, the approach of ' Null hypothesis' .

The wisdom of Gita (3-26)on null hypothesis is : na buddhi-bhedam janayed, ajnanam karma-sanginam ; josayet sarva-karmani ,vidvan yuktah samacaran:: Let not the wise disrupt the minds of the ignorant who are attached to fruitive action. They should not be encouraged to refrain from work, but to engage in work in the spirit of devotion.



 *What is null hypothesis?* - In inferential statistics, the null hypothesis is a general statement or default position that there is no relationship between two measured phenomena, or no association among groups. Testing (accepting, approving, rejecting, or disproving) the null hypothesis—and thus concluding that there are or are not grounds for believing that there is a relationship between two phenomena (e.g. that a potential treatment has a measurable effect)—is a central task in the modern practice of science; the field of statistics gives precise criteria for rejecting a null hypothesis. The null hypothesis is generally assumed to be true until evidence indicates otherwise. (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_hypothesis>)
