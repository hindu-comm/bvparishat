Namaste

  

Firstly we must recognise that pursuing the history of astronomy since the days of Vedas, and fitting our panchangas to positions and motion of the "planets" as we see them in the sky today are completely two different subjects.

  

Such discussions are further complicated by arguments whether our festivals should be aligned with the seasons -- Navaratra in Sharad and Holi in Vasanta -- or should be aligned with lunar months -- Navaratra in Ashvina and Holi in Falguna. ( I am in favour of celebrating festivals in the lunar months as provided in texts such as Nirnayasindhu. But as this thread is about adhimasa, I would not venture into this contentious issue.)  
  
It is further complicated by whether months Madhu, Madhava correspond to Chaitra, etc, or are two different sets.  
  
There are also some who regard later day improvements as "imports" but others see them as "organic developments".  
  
This discussion has brought to light most of the issues.  
  
Let me add one piece of information on adhimasa from Panchasiddhantika of Varahamihira when he describes the Paitamaha Siddhanta:  
  
रविशशिनोः पञ्च युगं वर्षाणि पितामहोपदिष्टानि ।  
अधिमासास्त्रिंशद्भिर्मासैरवमो द्विषष्ट्या तु ॥१॥

  
The Sanskrit tika is by Sudhakar Dvivedi:  
  
रविशशिनो रविचन्द्रयोर्युगं पञ्चवर्षात्मकं भवतीति पितामहेन पञ्चवर्षाण्युपदिष्टानि तथा त्रिंशद्भिर्मासैरेकोऽधिमासो दिनानां द्विषष्ट्याऽवमं चैकमित्येतानि सर्वाणि ब्रह्मणा कथितानि।

  

Thibaut's translation:  
According to the teaching of Pitamaha five years constitute a yuga of the sun and moon. The adhimasas are brought about by thirty months, and an omitted lunar day (avama) by sixty-two days.  
  
  
In those days a solar year was of 366 days, so the 5 years would of 1,830 days.

In the five-year period there would be two adhimasas (one in each 30 month period). So the tithis (without considering omitted days) would be, 62\*30= 1,860.

Now by dividing 1,860 by 62 we get, 30 avama days, and when we subtract 30 from 1860, we get 1830, which is number of the days of 5 solar years.

The 5 solar years and 5 lunar years, thus, terminate at the same point, and a new yuga starts.  
  
Now there is one problem, the solar year is not of 366 days, but of 365 days plus approx. 6 hours. So it is not clear how that extra 18 hours was taken care of.  
  
The book I have downloaded is one digitized by Google.  
  
Please pardon my transgression in the field where the learned are discussing.
