"That might have been during the reign of the famous Bhoja Raja thought to be a contemporary of Kalidasa.".

  

I think I might be wrong. 

  

I see in Wikipedia that Raja Bhoja was aParamāra king whose period of reign was 1010 to 1055 CE. But in Kerala, there are folktales connecting Kalidasa and Raja Bhoja of Dhārā. In the collection of folktales "Aitihyamāla", there is this story in which Kalidasa was the court poet in Raja Bhoja's court. Besides that, both had a bond of deep friendship between them.  For some reason, Kalidasa became estranged with the king and leaves the kingdom. The king becomes very sad and sends spies in search of his friend Kalidasa. The king gets the news that someone was found roaming in the forests who had some resemblance to Kalidasa. The king resorted to a trick to ascertain the identity of this person. He proceeds to the forest incognito to find this person.
He finds this stranger in the forest and tells him that the king of Dhara is no more. Stricken with extreme sorrow, the stranger says:

  

अद्य धारा निराधारा, निरालम्बा सरस्वती

पण्डिता खण्डिता सर्वॅ भोजराजे दिवंगते

  

The king then reveals himself to be Raja Bhoja. Kalidasa sings in extreme joy:

  

अद्य धारा सदाधारा, सदालम्बा सरस्वती

पण्डिता मण्डिता सर्वे भोजराजे भुवंगते

  

This is the story in Aitihyamala.

  

If this Bhoja has to be a contemporary of Kalidasa, he is a different Bhoja than the Paramara king Bhoja Deva.

  

Maybe, the sidereal Calendar was launched during the Gupta era, or slightly after that.
