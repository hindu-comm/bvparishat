Dear Shri Kaul,

  

The significance of Nakshatras (sidereal considerations) in the Vedas cannot be ignored in favor of the seasons. We have a description of the nakshatras in the Atharvaveda, Taittiriya Samhita and Brahmana, and the Shatapatha Brahmana. Please see the description of the 28 nakshatras (including Abhijit) in Atharvaveda 19.7.2-5 below:

There are prescriptions for certain karmas to be performed under certain nakshatras. See, for instance, Taittiriya Brahmana 1.1.2 according to which the consecration of the sacred fire is to be done under the Krttikas.

The Vedas also recognize the lunar sidereal month to be the traversal of the moon in the 27 asterisms. This is roughly 27.3 days. This should not be confused with lunar synodic month which is about 29.53 days.

  

Anand
