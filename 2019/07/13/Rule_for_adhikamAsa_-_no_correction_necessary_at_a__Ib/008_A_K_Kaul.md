Dear Shri Warrier,

Jai Shri Ram!

Neither any of the Vedas nor the Vedangas nor the Puranas nor the siddhantas has talked about any sidereal year.

Even the Bhagavadgita has talked about a year comprising two Ayanas of six months each which means a seasonal/tropical year.

Those six months are solar as well as lunar.

Each Ayana consists of six solar months whereas the Gita in the same shloka has talked about lunar months also when it has said

अग्निर्ज्योतिरहः शुक्लः षण्मासाः उत्तरायणम्।।.....

Thus there is absolutely no indication of any sidereal year in the Itihasas either.

This aberration of "narayana" seems to have crept in by not having followed/understood either the Surya Siddhanta or Aryabhatiya or the Siddhant Shiromani etc. properly though we swear by these works.

Makaranda and Graha-Laghava have been the main culprits for having created this mayhem!

That means we have to eliminate----do a correction of---- about 24 days from our calendar exactly as Pope Gregory had eliminated 10 days from the Julian calendar by frog-hopping to October 15 from October 4 in 1586.

The earlier we do so the better.

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!

Avtar Krishan Kaul
