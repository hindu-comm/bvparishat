Dear Shri Narayan Prasad ji,

Jai Shri Ram!

Kindly read my statement again.

I have talked about astronomical works from the Vedanga Jyotisham of Lagadha (15th century BCE) to the Siddhanta Shiromani of Bhaskaracharya-II (12th century AD).

Jyotisha as Vedanga is wrongly supposed to be predictive astrology when both these astronomers have declared jyotisham as a Vedanga for deciding proper timings of performing sacrifices.

Predictive astrology is the art of making correct predictions from incorrect data and it is directly related to intuition or may be even divine grace!

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!

A K Kaul

PS

There are quite a few mails with me awaiting a response.

I shall be replying them shortly.
