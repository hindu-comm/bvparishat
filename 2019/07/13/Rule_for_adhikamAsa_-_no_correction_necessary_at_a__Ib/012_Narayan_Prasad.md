Dear Shri Kaul Ji,

  Namaste!

  

\<\<I must put on record here that the Vedic solar months also were/are named Madhu, Madhava etc.\>\>

  

Don't you think it proper to have separate nomenclature for the lunar and solar months ?

  

\<\<As per the attachment Madhu-Madhava-lunr months, it is clear that lunar Madhu, Madhava etc. months have to be adjusted against and correlated with seasonal solar Madhu, Madhava etc. months.\>\>

  

BTW, is the English translation "History of Indian Astronomy" that of S.B. Dixit's work in Marathi (भारतीय ज्योतिषशास्त्राचा इतिहास) ?

Is this English translation complete ? Is it available nowadays? What are the publication details?

  

Thanks and regards

Narayan Prasad
