नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

The nomenclature (lunar) Chaitra, Vaishakha etc. has created a lot of confusion as some niraadhar nirayana followers are saying that Chaitra-Shukla Paksha Purnima has to be in (so called) Chitra Nakshatra---that too Lahiri nakshatras!---and then only the month will be named as Chaitra!

Shankar Balkrishan Dikshit has made it very clear that the names Chaitra etc. came into vogue quite late in the day as is clear from the attachment Madhu=Chaitra and no"no Rashis in the Vedas"!

                           ----- Vid A K Kaul

  

So it is clear that neither yourself nor Dikshit bothered to study Panini and महाभाष्यम् !

  

Very recently , in the post ' पाणिनिः - ज्योतिषम् ’ , I touched this aspect of how names such as चैत्रः are evolved - how can one say they are 'vogue quite late in the day ' .

  

नक्षत्रेण युक्तः कालः , सास्मिन् पौर्णमासीति (पा सू 4-2-3 , 4-2-21 )

  

I have already made it clear that you are quoting from the Vedic literature that is available now (12 or 13 Branches ) - there are/were 1130 Branches .

  

Patanjali quotes works like काष्ठम् , मुहूर्तम् ( सकाष्ठं ज्योतिषमधीते , समुहूर्तं ज्योतिषमधीते --

’ग्रन्थान्ताधिके च ’ पा सू 6-3-78 - सह is replaced by स ) । Did Dikshit study these works - when and where ? - at least does he know such and such books existed !

  

One should first study पाणिनीयम् and then go to other शास्त्र-s , otherwise he cannot do justice - his words cannot be taken as an authority.

  

More important - one cannot be taken seriously if he does not possess योगिप्रत्यक्षम् ।

  

Even Amarasimha says - पुष्ययुक्ता पौर्णमासी पौषी मासे तु यत्र सा ।

  

धन्यो’स्मि
