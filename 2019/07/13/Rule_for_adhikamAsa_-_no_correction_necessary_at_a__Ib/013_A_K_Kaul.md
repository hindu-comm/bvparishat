Dear Shri Narayan Prasadji,

Jai Shri Ram!

\<Don't you think it proper to have separate nomenclature for the lunar and solar months ?>

The nomenclature (lunar) Chaitra, Vaishakha etc. has created a lot of confusion as some niraadhar nirayana followers are saying that Chaitra-Shukla Paksha Purnima has to be in (so called) Chitra Nakshatra---that too Lahiri nakshatras!---and then only the month will be named as Chaitra!

Shankar Balkrishan Dikshit has made it very clear that the names Chaitra etc. came into vogue quite late in the day as is clear from the attachment Madhu=Chaitra and no"no Rashis in the Vedas"!

It is also surprising as to how these nirayana scholars claim that a lunar new year starts from Lahiri Chaitra, when right from the Surya Siddhanta to Siddhanta Shiromani, (from Alpha to Omega of Siddhantic astronomy!) all the astronomical works advise to make it start from (lunar) Madhu. The commentators right from Ranganatha to Pandit Sudhakar Dwivedi have named the same Madhu as (lunar) Chaitra. It is thus clear that because of our ignorance of the siddhantas, we are not celebrating any of the festivals whether lunar or solar, in accordance with any injunctions from the Vedic lore or Pauranic or siddhantic!

All we are doing is celebrating Lahiri lunar as well as solar months/festivals! That is why I call it "Almighty Lahiri Ayanamsha" which is actually niraadhar but it has over ruled the Vedic, Pauranic and siddhantic injunctions!!

Thus if we have to celebrate any Chaitri Navratra, it has to be the lunar month of Madhu Shukla Pratipat. We may name it Chaitra but will that be agreeable to nirayana jyotishis!

\<BTW, is the English translation "History of Indian Astronomy" that of S.B. Dixit's work in Marathi (भारतीय ज्योतिषशास्त्राचा इतिहास) ?

Is this English translation complete ? Is it available nowadays? What are the publication details?\>

I had got a hard copy of Part I of "History of Indian Astronomy" from Kolkata several decades back when part II was out of print. However, now both the parts (volumes) are available in pdf format.

I am also attaching the "aadesha Patra" of His Holiness Shankarcharya of Dwarka, issued by him in 1893, (and produced by S B Dikshit in his work) advising that nirayana is absolutely useless (niraadhaar!) for any religious festivals etc.

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!

A K Kaul
