Dear Shri Tuvij,  
Jai Shri Ram!

\<Erroneous judgement to see relative movement between seasons (say, solstices) and mAsa-s of panchAnga as a defect:

In reality this "defect" is deliberate and lets the logic of yuga-s (kali etc) work out within the panchanga framework.\>

As adhikamasa is a phenomenon going on since the earliest viz. the Rig-Veda (1/25/8

वेदमासोधृतव्रतो द्वादश प्रजावतः \|वेदा य उपजायते)it has nothing to do with any yuga including the Kaliyuga!

Even otherwise also, the Kali Era that is given in the Panchangas and which we are following has absolutely no basis, either astronomical or scientific nor even scriptural.

It has come into vogue from about 499 AD when Aryabhata claimed in his Aryabhatiya that he was 23 years old when 3600 years of Kaliyuga had elapsed.

\<mAgha is no ordinary mAsa and the start of the present kali is linked to WS in mAgha. In fact mAgha in Hindu panchAnga has some invariant properties that help us identify even the nakshatra (hence rAshi) framework changes over really long periods of time>

Present Kaliyuga is supposed to have started on either Ujjain mean midnight of February 17/18, 3102 BCE at Ujjain (as per the Surya Siddhanta) or at about 6-00 am of Ujjain mean time at Ujjain on February 18, 3102 BCE as per Aryabhatiya! (Just see the confusion here also!)

As per the attachment Kali-zero planets, it was the Vedic month of Tapasya/Phalguna then. The Winter Solstice was on January 13/14 in 3102 BCE. That means it was more than a month before the so called (current) Kaliyuga started.

\<The problem is, such intricate subjects cannot be done justice with in decrepit Indian University system, or for that matter committees lorded by comrades.>

The problem of calendar reform has been going on for the last more than two hundred years. The late Pandit S B Dikshit had done a Herculean job and started publishing a Panchanga as per the injunctions of shastras with expenses from his own pocket without any subsidy from anybody.

But because of vested interests he had to close it!

Pandit Dikshit was neither a comrade nor a faculty member of any decrepit University!

Efforts have been going on ever since.

The Calendar Reform Committee of 1954-55 had invited suggestions/objections from one and all. Almost every Panchanga-maker had participated in it.

The Committee had arrived at a uniform decision that a (so called) Sayana calendar should be followed. But again, it was derailed by vested interests including its Secretary, late N C Lahiri who was publishing his own (Nirayana, of course!) Lahiri Panchang in Bangla and Lahiri's Indian Ephemeris in English!

\<And I don't see BVP as a right platform either.>

Honestly, I wonder as to if a forum like BVP which has a galaxy of Samskrit scholars of extraordinary caliber in almost all the disciplines is not the right platform for this arduous but the most essential chore, which other forum is!

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!

A K Kaul
