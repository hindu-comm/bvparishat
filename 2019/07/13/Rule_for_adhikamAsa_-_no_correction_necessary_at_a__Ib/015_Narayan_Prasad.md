Dear Shri Kaul ji and Prof. Wakankar,

  Namaste!

  Thanks a lot to both of you.

 

  Here are the three links:

  

  <https://archive.org/details/BharatiyaJyotishSastra1>  
  <https://archive.org/details/BharatiyaJyotishSastra2>  
  
  <https://archive.org/details/IndianCalendarSewelDikshit/page/n6>

  

  Long back I saw only the first part in English translation at BORI library. The second part was not available there.

  Anyway, in the year 2000, I could get a copy of the third edition of**भारतीय ज्योतिषशास्त्राचा इतिहास** in Marathi published from Pune in 1989. Cover page attached.

  Its Hindi translation appeared long back (in 1957 ?) probably from Allahabad.  

  Best regards  

  Narayan Prasad
