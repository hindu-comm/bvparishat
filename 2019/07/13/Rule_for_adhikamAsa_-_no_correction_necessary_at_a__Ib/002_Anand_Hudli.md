Namaste Mahodaya,

  

Hindu lunisolar calendar is based on sidereal (background of stars) consideration more than seasons. So it is debatable whether panchanga makers in the country will unanimously agree that adhikamasa system in current use should be given up. As things stand currently, with different computational methods (sUrya siddhAnta, AryabhaTIya, dRggaNita, etc.) in preparing panchangas, we see significant differences in dates of festivals and observances. If we introduce an additional method to make festivals closer to seasons, i.e. following the tropical year rather than sidereal year, there will be further confusion. Note also that elimination of adhikamAsas will not guarantee coincidence of festivals with the "correct" season all the time, since in that case we will be following a lunar calendar instead of a lunisolar calendar. That would lead to festivals falling in different seasons in different years and not just the "correct" season.

  

Anand
