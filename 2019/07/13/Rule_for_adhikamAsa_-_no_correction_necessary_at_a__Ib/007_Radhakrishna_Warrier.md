“But the Hindu's calendar is based on sidereal year.

  

The mean value of tropical year in the year 2000 AD:365.242190402 mean solar days.

  

The mean value of sidereal year in the year 2000 AD:365.256363004 mean solar days.

  

(See:[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidereal_year#CITEREFIERS2014](https://nam02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FSidereal_year%23CITEREFIERS2014&data=02%7C01%7C%7C2cb87a27c74347d5d04608d708ef7e68%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C636987697021110258&sdata=JAjsYSbiiziVlvgDa55bkzg%2BqiGqFUMmukxOSt2yZ3o%3D&reserved=0))

  

So the difference between the two: 0.014172602 mean solar days.

Its inverse = 70.5586

  

So error of 1 day will occur in about 70.56 years and of 30 days in about 2116 years.”

  

Currently, many in India celebrate Uttaraayana (winter solstice) on January 14th, although the actual event is on December 21. There is thus a difference of 24 days. Does it mean that both (the actual and that which is celebrated) coincided 1693 years ago? Then it would mean that the present sidereal calendar came into existence at that time.
That might have been during the reign of the famous Bhoja Raja thought to be a contemporary of Kalidasa.

(अद्य धारा निराधारा निरालम्बा सरस्वति ... fame)

I believe the difference between sidereal and solar years is due to the precession of the equinox.

Radhakrishna Warrier
