I never said that adhikamasa has something to do with Kaliyuga. Anyway the presence of adhikamasa in Veda makes it clear that the (mainstream) panchanga has always been luni-solar : i.e. neither solar, nor lunar. I remember some old references that even talk about paksha-s in the core Vaidika mAsa-s such as tapah etc.

You mean WS was near the start of mAgha (when Kali was about to start), right? This is what I meant, too.

  

Even then - though your calculations exactly support my statement - I'm presently cautious of calculations correlating ancient panchanga dates with the gregorian.

As I've said before we need to be wary of Lahiri or any other formula for correlating ancient panchanga dates with the gregorian.

  

As a general rule when one talks about means and perturbations, one must understand that cumulative errors are bound to increase over large spans (of time). (are choas-theoretic aspects not at play?)

  

Perhaps scholars at this forum (who have worked with/ made such algorithms; e.g. open-source "Pancanga 3.14") should shed more light on this. This will help others to develop (if needed) one in quick time.

On this point I concede my mistake for making that remark. Perhaps with time permitting I should start a separate thread explaining in precise terms my defence of luni-solar traditional panchanga from first principles, as well as covering its evolution, and what needs to be done.

  

A last remark: Hindu panchanga is neither siderial nor tropical.
