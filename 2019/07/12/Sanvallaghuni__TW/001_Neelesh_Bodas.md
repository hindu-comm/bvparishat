विद्वन्,

  

अङ्गसंज्ञानिमित्तं यच्चङ्परं णिरिति यावत् तत्परं यल्लघु तत्परो योऽङ्गस्याभ्यासस्तस्य सनीव कार्यं स्यात् णावग्लोपेऽसति । This is the first paksha in kaumudi and it has been accepted by Bhashya. This is the correct vigraha, so that answers your question.  
  
Now lets dive deeper to understand why this is the correct vigraha. To understand that, we need to know how to exactly interpret "अङ्गस्य अभ्यासः" . There are two ways -  
  
**कार्यकालपक्ष -**  
The अभ्यास from पूर्वोऽभ्यासः will be brought at सन्वल्लघुनि. By doing पदैकवाक्यता we get अङ्गस्य पूर्वः अभ्यासः, तस्य सन्वत् । The inherent meaning is that the entire anga must be repeated, and it's पूर्व will then be called अभ्यास. The entire अङ्ग can only get repeated for एकाच् dhatus. (In anekach dhatus, only a part gets repeated). Hence it follows that in the कार्यकालपक्ष, only the एकाच् धातवः are eligible for सन्वद्भाव. Which means that जागृ (अनेकाच् धातु) will never get सन्वद्भाव in the first place.

  
HOWEVER, the Bhashyakara, in सन्वल्लघुनि, poses a question on possibility of सन्वद्भाव in अजजागरत्, and resolves it by saying that there is व्यवधान of जा between ज and ग ।  
  
Now, if we consider Bhashyam as the ultimate pramaan, then we must accept that अनेकाच् dhatu can also get सन्वद्भाव. This is contradicting कार्यकालपक्ष. Hence we resort to यथोद्देशपक्ष.  
  
**यथोद्देशपक्ष -**  
The term अभ्यास will be interpreted at पूर्वोभ्यासः, and सन्वल्लघुनि will go there. This results in वाक्यैकवाक्यता, and we get - पूर्वः अभ्यासः, अङ्गस्य अभ्यासस्य सन्वत् । So here, first the द्वित्व happens (not necessary for the entire anga), and the अभ्याससंज्ञक generated from that द्वित्व, which is now a part of the अङ्ग, undergoes सन्वद्भाव. So here अङ्गस्य अभ्यासस्य is taken as अवयवषष्ठी - अङ्गस्य अवयवः यः अभ्यासः । This allows a possibility of सन्वद्भाव in "अट् + ज + जागर् + णिच् + चङ् + तिप्", which is then blocked by saying that the लघु "ग" is not immediately after the अभ्यास ज, since there is a vyavadhana of जा. and we are now in sync with Bhashya. (किंच अजजागरदित्यत्र सन्वत्त्वमाशङ्क्यणिपरकलघोर्गकाराकारस्य "जा" इत्यनेन व्यवहितत्वादभ्यासस्य न सन्वत्त्वमिति समाहितं भाष्ये - इति 7.4.94 इत्यत्र बालमनोरमा) ।  
  
However if now we consider आट् + ऊर्णु + नु + णिच् + चङ् + तिप्, then all conditions of सन्वल्लघुनि are satisfied, and hence there is a scope for सन्वद्भाव. Since there is nothing "सन्वत् कार्य" that is feasible here, no सन्वद्भाव will actually happen. But it is worth noting that सन्वद्भाव is not blocked, and hence दीर्घोः लघोः can happen (remember - सन्वद्भावविषये अपि दीर्घः भवति, न हि सन्वत् कार्ये कृते एव दीर्घः भवति), and this will cause a final form as और्णूनुवत् - which is a wrong form. The correct form is और्णुनवत्, and it can only be generated by resorting to कार्यकालपक्ष and blocking सन्वद्भाव of अनेकाच् verbs.  
  
So in summary - we must resort to कार्यकालपक्ष for deriving forms like और्णुनवत्, and must resort to यथोद्देशपक्ष for staying in sync with भाष्यमतम्, and then being able to derive forms like अजजागरत् । The point to note, is that both these pakshas are mapped to one and the same vigraha of the sutra (Given as "first paksha" in Kaumudi, written above) and it is the word "अङ्गस्य अभ्यासः" whose two interpretations are done to justify two prayogas (and भाष्यसम्मति).

  

This is very much justified. Afterall, प्रयोगशरणाः वैयाकरणाः ।

  

Does this answer your question? I have tried to explain based on my limited understanding and I am open for discussion / learning.
