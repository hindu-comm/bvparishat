Yes.  
Thank you so much. Alot.  
  
So does this mean that there is only 1 final vigrah and Paksha is dependent on which prayoga we want to make?  
According to Prayoga, Vaiyakaranas decide their desired Paksha?  
  
Then fine.  
  
Also, In उपधाह्रस्व, is there any relation of अग्लोप? Both Sutras are miles apart so no Anuvritti Aashanka. 7.4.1 णौ चङि and 7.4 93 सन्वल्लघुनि.  
  
In places where there is a problem, like in अचूचुरत्, there is problem of णिलोप being Sthanivat, but Padamanjarikara says, that if it were स्थानिवत्, in ओण्ऋ अपनयने which is ऋदित्, that would be waste.  
आ+औण्(इ)+इ+अत् in this case, if इ waa स्थानिवत् there would automatically not be any type of उपधाह्रस्व, the ऋदित्करण would be waste, hence it prooves that उपधाह्रस्वे णिलोपो न स्थानिवत्।  
  
So, in अचूचुरत् also, there is no स्थानिवद्भाव and hence no issues in उपधाह्रस्व, the अग्लोप can't stop it. अग्लोप is only बाधक for सन्वद्भाव resulting in अभ्यासदीर्घ ।  
  
But they see अग्लोप is बाधक for it also. How? If they don't say then okay,  
  
For that solution is to accept चङ्परकण्याकृतिजातिपरकत्व instead of चङ्-परकणिपरकत्व। which i understood till now.
