Dear Shri Narayan ji:-

  

<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/bvparishat/mjBIF1im6dU>

  

The above link has some more resources but not the one you have asked for.

  

WRT the actual book you have asked for, I have just confirmed that it is available at the Kuppuswami Research Institute at Sanskrit College.

  

Unfortunately it is not available for sale since it is more than 50 years old. If you confirm that you cannot get it anywhere else, I will go there in person and (depending on condition of book) have it scanned for you.

  

Let me know what works best.

  

Apparently KRI has the entire works of Sri PS Subramanai Sastri.

  

Regards,

  

Venkat
