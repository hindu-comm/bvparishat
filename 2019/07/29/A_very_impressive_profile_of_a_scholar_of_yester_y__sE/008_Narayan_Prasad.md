Dear Sir,  

   Namaste.

   Actually long back I had come across this book with a foot-path bookseller at Pune. This book was in a very bad condition. Still I took it.

   It has got viii+228 pp.

   But in the copy I could get has the initial 164 pp and then pp.173-194. Other pages are missing.

   Dr PSS has quoted a few sUtras fromशब्दमणिदर्पणम् (Kannada grammar). But has not mentioned which edition he used.

   The scan of contents page and the last page attached.

   If the portion I have got could be useful to somebody, I could send it. But it is scanned in djvu format.

   Thanks and regards

   Narayan Prasad
