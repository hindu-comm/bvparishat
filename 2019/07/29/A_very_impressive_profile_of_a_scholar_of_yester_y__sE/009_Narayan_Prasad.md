Dear Dr Venkat Veeraraghavan ji,

  Namaste.

  I found this book very interesting. It gives a lot many examples from all the important Dravidian language grammars for comparison.

  Before I saw this incomplete work to my disposal, I had already seen Krishnamacharya's "A Grammar of the Modern Kannada Language" (1882) in which comparison of Kannada with Tamil (the latter in the Tamil script) has been presented. It was rather a surprise for me. A sample page from this book is attached.

  If it is possible to get a scan copy of the whole book, or at least for the missing pages in my copy, without much problem, I would welcome it.

  Thanks and regards

  Narayan Prasad
