Namaste.

  

  

\<\<I’ll go to the library today and while there see if the books are physically there, the catalog says they are.>\>

  

Thank you so much for very prompt response.

In case you are to scan it, then in color please !

I have the facility to see the color scan in bw. When I require a printout, I view it as bw. For example, pp.120-121 sent earlier in color is attached herewith in bw.

Thanks and regards

Narayan Prasad
