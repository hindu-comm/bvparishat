Dear Shri Narayan ji-

  

Kindly do not address me as Dr. I am not a Dr. in any field.

  

So you can read Kannada and Tamil script as well? (I am feeling more and more out of depth..;-))

  

Do you want the Kannada book (Hosagannada nudigannadi) or the book by PSS where you mentioned you were missing pages?

  

Can you please confirm for me which pages of that book by Shri PSS you want?

I can mail them to you when I go to KSRI.

  

Kind Regards,

  

Venkat
