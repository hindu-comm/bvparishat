Dear V. Subrahmanian,  
  
Are you after this specific book?  
For instance, Sastri's made other great contributions, e.g. his  
helpful Lectures on Mahabhasya in 14 volumes. There is also a book  
called 'An enquiry into the relationship of Sanskrit and Tamil', which  
is the text of lectures Sastri delivered in 1946.  
Please send a private message to discuss.  
  
Irene
