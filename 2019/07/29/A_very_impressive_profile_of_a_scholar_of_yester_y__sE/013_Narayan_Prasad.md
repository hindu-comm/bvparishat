Dear Shri Venkat ji,

  

  

\<\<Kindly do not address me as Dr. I am not a Dr. in any field.>\>

OK. Similar is the case with me.

  

\<\<So you can read Kannada and Tamil script as well?>\>

  

I can read in almost all the Indian scripts.

  

\<\<Do you want the Kannada book (Hosagannada nudigannadi) or the book by PSS where you mentioned you were missing pages>\>

  

I have got a hard copy of the Kannada book in goodcondition.

As already indicated in my earlier message regarding the book by PSS: "But in the copy I could get has the initial 164 pp and then pp.173-194. Other pages are missing. ".

  

Thanks and regards

Narayan Prasad
