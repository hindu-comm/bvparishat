Welcome, Subrahmanian ji.

  

*[2/5: Vakyartha Sadas \| Manipulation of Traditional Categories by Western Indology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea2Qc8gZOKU&t=18s)*

  

Excerpt from video description: "The Manipulation of Traditional categories: paramarthika-sat (truth dealing with the non-worldly, spiritual ) and vyavaharika-sat (truth dealing with the worldly), kavya (literature, poetry) and sastra (vedic wisdom). The false dichotomies introduced by Sheldon Pollock, to create fault-lines that aid in theorising the evolution and basis of Indian knowledge traditions to fit into western theories of socialism, power, oppression and various others, are addressed based on the traditional understanding and evolution. The attack on oral traditions and its supposed dichotomy with literary traditions is also addressed."
