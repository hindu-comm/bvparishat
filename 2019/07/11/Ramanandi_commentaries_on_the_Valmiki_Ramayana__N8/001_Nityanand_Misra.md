Shivasahaya, the author of the Ramayana-shiromani commentary, is believed to be a Vaishya scholar in the Ramanandi tradition though I do not think he identifies his *varna* or *sampradaya* in his commentary. Once while discussing use of Prakrit meters in Samskrita, the Devarshi Kalanatha Shastri Ji had also remarked to me that the author Ramayana-shiromani was a Vaishya in the Ramanandi tradition. The verses he cites from the Agastya-samhita, Brihad-brahma-samhita, other Pancharatra texts, and Ramatapiniya Upanishad at the beginning of his
commentary are very popular among Ramanandis.
