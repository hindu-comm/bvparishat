Dear Nityananda-ji

Valmikiya Ramayana is more appropriate than Valmiki Ramayana. I am saying that because my father( Sri Purna Chandra Patnaik) who translated the Sanskrit Ramayana written by Valmiki into Odia, chose as the title to his book as  ‘ Valmikiya Ramayana - Odia Padyanubada’

Devanarayan
