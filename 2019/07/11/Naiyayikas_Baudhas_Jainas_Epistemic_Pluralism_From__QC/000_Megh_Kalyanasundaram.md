Jonardon Ganeri (2019) paper:*[Epistemic Pluralism: From Systems to Stances\*](https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/7A77880075B67DAE4AEDF81482C3DC86/S2053447718000349a.pdf/epistemic_pluralism_from_systems_to_stances.pdf)*

  

  

p. 20: "A pluralism about epistemic cultures, practices, perspectives or stances is compatible with the idea that there is a single reality to be explored, a multi-aspectual, multidimensional, multiply essensed one. **That is the lesson I have learned from my study of India’s profound tradition of intellectual pluralism.** It is deeply encouraging to me that contemporary thinkers—some through empirical analysis of actual scientific practices, some through cross-cultural historical explorations of the contrasts between ancient Greece and China, and others through a philosophical wish to escape the horns of the oscillation between scientism and subjectivism—have begun to converge on some version of exactly the solution **first espoused by the Jainas of India**, namely that **epistemic cultures are practical policies to be adopted, not sets of propositions to be believed, and that reality is manifold, so that no one epistemic culture can claim privileged access to nature as it is in itself**." \[Emphasis added\]  

  

p. 9: "The stance taken by the Naiyāyikas is that mental states must be owned by a subject, where ownership consists in endorsing the belief, preference, commitment, or aspiration represented in the state. That is, the aspiration, commitment, preference, or belief is made one’s own. This stance is thus a normative approach to what is at stake in undertaking a first-person position. A quite different stance towards the human subject is taken by the Ābhidharmika Buddhists, whose stance is instead phenomenological. The Buddhist investigation of the first-person position is conducted with an approach that emphasizes the analytical dissection of the phenomenological character of presented mental states, most especially states of attention and attachment. Are these two philosophical approaches in contradiction with each other? **That was certainly the story of the intellectual rivalry between Nyāya and Buddhism throughout the first millennium, the result, say the Jainas, of dogmatism on both sides.** Yet we may **instead take a more nuanced view about the multi-aspectual nature of human subjectivity, and what I have argued is that owning a mental state itself has several aspects, one of which is correctly explored by each of the two supposedly rival philosophical schools**. We might agree to say that Buddhists and Naiyāyikas employ different epistemic methodologies, as long as we are clear that this does not consist in the claim that they have rival conceptions of epistemic justification, only that their epistemic policies, approaches, cultures, are distinct. **It is just because mental ownership, the foundation of subjectivity, is multi-aspected that there can be different approaches to it, in much the same way that it is just because objects have many properties that there can be different names with different senses for one and the same object.**" \[Emphasis added\]
