Dear Scholars,  

  Namaste.

  Are there any soft (scanned) copies of "The Astrological Magazine", edited by Dr B.V. Raman ?

  

 If yes, I am esp. interested in:

     Jan., Feb., April, May, June, Sep. issues of 1982

     Jan., Feb. issues of 1985

     Jan. issue of 1990

     Oct. issue of 1993

  Thanks and regards  

  Narayan Prasad
