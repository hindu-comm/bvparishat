Dear Vidwans,

  

My immediate response would be 'no'. We do not process what is heard in real time, if by 'real time' you mean 'immediate'. If a speaker is about ten feet away, their sound would take some time to reach the ear. It appears to be immediate because sound travels rather fast. There has to be a time lag, maybe in miliseconds or nano seconds. So the delay is there.
