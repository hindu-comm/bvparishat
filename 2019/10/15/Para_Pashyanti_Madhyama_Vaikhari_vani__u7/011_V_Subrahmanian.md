I think this goes well with the Mandukya Upanishad. It starts with the declaration of 'पादचतुष्टयम्' (सोऽयमात्मा चतुष्पात्) and goes to describe the three pAda-s, jaagrat, svapna and suShupti. The 'Fourth' is not really a paada but the only Truth that is immanent and transcending the three pAda-s. It is called 'chaturtham' only by courtesy, in relation to the three. The seventh mantra there negates the three and calls the 'chaturtham' alone as shaantam shivam advaitam.
