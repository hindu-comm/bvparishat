\>While I am not an expert in Srividya, I understand the 'Para' in the Vakyapadiyam refers to Sri Mata in Kundalini traveling from Muladhara converting to PaSyanti in Anahata, Madhyama in ViSuddha, and finally Vaikhari as it comes out of the 8 locations of the sound creation area from Kantham to OshTa. Srividya Rahasyam commentary has the details.

  

-- You could be right.

  

But the text does not have those details .

  

readingSri Vidyaa into that text may be looked at as imposition of a different or later thought onto the text.
