Shri Karve,

  

I have summarized the bhashya pravachanam by an eminent scholar of the Lalita sahasra naamam, ( by the way it is against the sloka referred by Shri Subramanian) and you say ‘the three non discernible processes are the same process. By what pramaana are you saying this? Please elaborate.

  

Regards,

  

Krishna Kumar Pillalamarri
