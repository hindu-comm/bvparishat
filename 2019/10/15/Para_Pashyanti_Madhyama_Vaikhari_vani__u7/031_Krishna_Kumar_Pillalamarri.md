Dear Vidwans,

  

I went to the pravachanams of the famous - BrahmaSri SaamavEdam ShaNmukha Sarma garu - and am summarizing what I heard here. Any mistakes here are mine, and not his. But I think this has a direct answer to Shri Achyut Karve's question as well. This is not a translation directly. If there is a demand, I can produce that too. Apparently (since I have not personally checked), Panini and others endorse the view below.

  

This talk of his is part of his Srividya series. Apart from the four Para, Pashyanti, Madhyama and Vaikhari, there are a few other steps we need to consider.

  

First, there has to be an 'iccha' to speak. This starts in the (brain) chitti, and is the 'kaaraNa' of the act of speaking. This is the 'Chaitanyam' or 'spandana Sakti ' that starts the process of speech. This spandana travels through the Sushumna Nadi (spine, effectively) to the moolaadhaara chakram, located at the base of the spine. It immediately starts rising back up the Sushumna. The speed with which spandana travels to mooladhara has been compared to the speed of electricity (vidyut vEgam), and enables a very quick response to whatever caused the spandana to occur.

  

The process of this chaitanyam starting from Moolaadhaara chakram is called ' Paraa daSa '. (udyukta daSa). From there it moves towards Anahata chakram, and attains the 'Bhava daSa' there meaning it forms the thoughts and subject, and required background information, and inform the ' manas '. By the time it reaches Anahata, ' बुद्धि ' is observing this chaitanyam, and hence at this stage chaitanyam is called 'Pashyanti'. There is no sound yet. Sound occurs in Vaikhari. But between Pashyanti and Vaikhari, there is another stage called ' Madhyama daSa' (between Pashyanti and Vaikhari ' ) in which it forms the vaakyam in sookshma form combining it with all the knowledge required from memory, rasa, bhava, and other required features. It is here that the language in which you wish to speak, its constructs, etc., (any language in which you are proficient) are selected. The sentence or phrase or word is formed here in Madhyama daSa. In the ViSuddha chakram, ( at the throat ) it forms sound by vibrating air at Kantham, taalu, danta and Oshta and naasika. The last Vaikhari daSa produces the sound. This Vak is the prakatana of 'PraaNa Sakti', which is nothing but the female brahman, or Lalitaa Devi.Tthis Prana Sakti is the ' svaasa', or the breath. That is why if breath is held up, sound does not occur.

  

So an easy equivalence can be drawn between Vak and PraaNa Sakti. Conserving Vak conserves Praana Sakti, and elongates life expectancy. Maunam is said to contribute to realizing Brahman due to this reason.

  

For Easwara also, the same four stages are there, except it is in creation of cosmos basis. Easwara has 'sankalpam' to create the cosmos, and combines with Sakti to start the process. This is Para. The bhava daSa for him also is to decide what he wants to create. This is his Pashyanti. The 'how' of the creation process is his Madhyama, and the prakatana of cosmos is his Vaikhari. So our VakSakti is similar to Paramatma creating the universe. In other words, shorn of 'maya' on his side, and 'aham' on our side, both chaitanyams are the same.

  

This process is explained as:

  

मूलाधारात समुत्पन्नः, पराख्यो नाद संभवः

सयेव ऊर्ध्वतयानीतः स्वाधिष्टाने विज्रुम्भितः

पष्यन्त्स्याख्यामवाप्नोति तयैयोर्ध्वो शनै: शनैः

अनाहते बुद्धि तत्व समेतो मध्यमाविदः

तथा तयोर्ध्वन्नुन्नस्सन् विशुद्धौ कण्ठदेशत: वैखर्याख्या\|

  

This 'VaagdEvi' is everywhere in the world, in living and non living things. She is in ' Para ' roopam in stones, mountains, etc. She is in ' PaSyanti ' roopam in trees, etc., (all botanical life). In animals, she is in the ' Madhyama ' form. Only in humans she appears in Vaikhari. That's why only humans can speak and express their thoughts. This is also the reason why humans are given ' mantram '. By doing the mantra japam, they can observe the movement of Vak in their body, and go to the ' naadam' or naada svaroopa brahmam. That is Tapas.

  

The above explanation is not mine. I am only summarizing here. The explanation is by BrahmaSree SaamavEdam Shanmukha Sarma garu.

  

It strikes me about the absolute scientific explanations by our Rishis on the minute details of what is essentially a very difficult process to understand. There is a lot more on this subject as many have expressed here. I wanted to give the explanation as per yoga and kundalini process.
