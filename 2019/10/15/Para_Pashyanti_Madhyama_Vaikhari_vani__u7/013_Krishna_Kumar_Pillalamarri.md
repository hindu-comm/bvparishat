Dear Sri Nagaraj garu,

  

While I am not an expert in Srividya, I understand the 'Para' in the Vakyapadiyam refers to Sri Mata in Kundalini traveling from Muladhara converting to PaSyanti in Anahata, Madhyama in ViSuddha, and finally Vaikhari as it comes out of the 8 locations of the sound creation area from Kantham to OshTa. Srividya Rahasyam commentary has the details.

  

Regards,

Krishna Kumar Pillalamarri
