Dear Vidwans,

  

Are the four parts of Vak Para, Pashyanti, Madhyama and Vaikhari also applicable to the animals who communicate with the means of sound?

  

It appears to be so because Patanjali in his Yoga Sutra says that a Yogi can even understand the calls of birds, etc.

  

Withregards,

Achyut Karve.
