India excelled in creative work by creating a scholarly model of examining each utterance for its originality.

People did not express what they thought, but what they discovered. The art of analysis and discovery

was certainly eroded with the Mughal oppression and the British tried to replace it with creating an education

system to prepare people to "read." So we have the modern literacy, when we "read" others. We have to change

that to "what we do", when we engage ourselves fully with the thought.
Particularly it is important when we  

enter into research with our own motivation than being tasked. Most of the bad Indology work during the

colonial period happened because people had to fulfill a task. Indian originality was restored through new

indigenous science institutions. We have the responsibility to achieve that in languages and humanities.

We have to think deeper and not settle with conjectures. More unsettled we are, better insight would

come. We may make small or no advance, but our feet must be grounded.
Let us celebrate the scholarship

endowed to us by Panini, Bharata and Bhatrhari.
