There are three types of paraa vaak "pashyanti","madhyamaa","vaikhari" . "Para vaak is not type. U can see "Shiva sutra". text , where all this mentioned in that. In that book there are three types of vaak . That doesn't count "paraa vaak" as fourth type. Para vaak has tree types "pashyanti" etc. not vaak.

  And I think "vakyapadiya " also describes only three types of vaak except "paraa". Although "vakyapadiya" counts four types of vaak but paraa vaak is "anirvachaniya". complete vaakyapadiya goes to end with describing three types of vaak.

In Shiva darshan philosophy "paraa" is not type. See specialy Shiva daravan where writer opposes Vakyapadiya theory.

There is written in Rig-Veda "chatvaari vaak parimitaa padaani ...."Grammarians comment differently on this mantra , not as four types of vaak...
