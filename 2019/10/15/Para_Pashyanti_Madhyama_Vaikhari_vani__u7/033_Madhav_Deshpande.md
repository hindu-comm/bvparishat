It may be noted that the phrase*चत्वारि*वाक्परिमिता पदानि has been interpreted variously in the Mahābhāṣya and the Nirukta: चत्वारि पदजातानि - नामाख्यातोपसर्गनिपाता:. The interpretation that these four Padas of Vāk refer to Parā, Paśyantī, Madhyamā and Vaikharī develops much later during the time of Bhartr̥hari and subsequent authors.
Otherwise, these terms are absent in the earlier works.
