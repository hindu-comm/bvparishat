The three referred to as not discernible or hidden point to the same process which might have been named as Para, Pashyanti and Madhyama later.

  

Just as is the case of simultaniety in the production of a communication in the speaker and its reception by the listener so is the case with Pashyanti and Madhyama. Though they are two different words written sequentially they are not two different processes. This is supported by the vartik 'Siddhe Shabdaarth Sambandhe'.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
