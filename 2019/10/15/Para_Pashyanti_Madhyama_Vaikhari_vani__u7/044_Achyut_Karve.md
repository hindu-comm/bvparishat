Dear Vidwans,

  

A communication has two aspects. The thing that carries and the thing that is carried. The vaikhari is the sum total of both the carrier and the carried. In simpleterms the message is modulated over the effort.
Thus there has to be simultaniety between the Pashyanti (which is the message) and the Madhyama ( which is the carrier). The receiver of the communication has to untangle the vaikhari by abstracting the effort contained in the vaikhari and receive the message.

  

This has been appreciated by Bhartruhari when he says that the vaikhari exists only in the presence of a listener.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
