Today I read the preamble of Indian Association of Cultivation of Science,

the first institution with the "desirability of cultivation of sciences by the

natives of India." This was 1869. CV Raman did his work there in his off

time from the financial services. As he said later his Nobel

prize work had expense of Rs 300. It is past time when we restrain

from settling our scientific ideas by analyzing philosophy than doing  

experiments. It could be a task worth pursuing for the future of India.  

  

I urge all to dive more into these topics than settle with texts.

We have a storehouse of information to work on.  

  

Sorry for this digression. But it is painful to read the material how

occupation was imposed through simple chemistry.
