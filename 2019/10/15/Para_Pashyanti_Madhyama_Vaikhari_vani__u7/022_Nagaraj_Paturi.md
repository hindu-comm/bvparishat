Dear Sri Achyut-ji,

  

Fortunately or unfortunately for you, even this question is already answered by Vakyapadiyam.

  

According to VP, when a sentence is uttered by the speaker, the sound produced for that purpose, travels as 'atoms' (smallest portions of sound) and each of such 'atoms' (sound waves produced by each of those strikings at the sthaanas by the karaNa ) strike the ear, one after the other. Though the effect of each of these sounds on the ear is immediately lost, their memory remains for a few more seconds. I give the name 'persistence of audition' to this idea proposed by Bhartrihari. (know / remember persistence of vision ? ) All these memories together , at the end of the pronunciation of the sentence by the speaker, produce vaakyaartha in the listener.
