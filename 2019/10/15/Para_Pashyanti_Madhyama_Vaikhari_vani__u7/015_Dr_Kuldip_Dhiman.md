I agree Nagaraj ji. I am working on Trik Shaivism, and they claim that it was Somananda who did not agree with Bhartrihari that language has three stages, so he went on to add the forth level called Para. I do not agree with this view as I have believe that the idea of four levels of language is much older than even Bhartrihari. I found a Shloka in Yoga Kundali Upanishad (Yajurveda) which mentions Para.

परायामंकुरी भूय पश्यन्तां द्वीदलीकृता। मध्यमायां मुकुलिता वैखर्या विकसीकृता। पूर्व यथोदिता वाग्विलोमेनास्तगा भवेत।।     
योगकुण्डल्युपनिषद् 3: 18,19

I am certain Yoga Kundali Upanishad is a lot older than Bhartrihari. Could any of the scholars in this group comment on this point. Or does anyone know the rough date of Yoga Kundali Upanishad. Thank you.
