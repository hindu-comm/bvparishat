Here in Vakyapadiyam 1-159, Vaikharee , Madhyamaa, Pas'yantee are mentioned three sacred stages, teerthas.

  

That leads to the question - what has set out to pass through the three stations and what is passing through or to those three stages?

  

If that which is passing through these three stages is taken /agreed as the paraa vaak, we can conclude that this verse is indirectly mentioning paraa vaak.
