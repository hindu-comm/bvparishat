I might add one more thing: Our seers showed us the differences by identifying each of these 4 stages - Para, Pashyanti, Madhyama and Vaikhari - with different देवता नामानि to show that these are distinct stages in speech production. Why do we not agree? Do we know the process even now as clearly and distinctly as we need to know that we can ignore the different stages?

  

Best Regards,

Krishna Kumar Pillalamarri
