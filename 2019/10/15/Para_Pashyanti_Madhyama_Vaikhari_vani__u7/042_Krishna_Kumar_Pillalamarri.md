Dear Vidwans,

  

I am trying hard to understand Shri Achyut Karve's conjecture here, and basically the need for it against multiple sources of the 4 layer model already quoted by several people. I am not fighting it per se, but to justify such a new model creation, there must be a need and a reason. I have an example I can quote: In the early IT systems developed by both IBM and Digital Equipment Corporation, the network stack was 8 layers. Unix, developed much later, became popular, with 7 layers stack eventually adopted by ISO and now reduced to 5 layers other than the physical layer. The functionality described in the old layer and the new layer is absolutelythe same; however, how the actual stack progression occurs has a bearing on the outcome. If I assume Shri Karve is saying similar things for Vak progression, I am still stuck with the problem of not having all the required processes met. Kindly allow me to give an example here as well.

  

As Vak (spanda Sakti) rises from moolaadhaara, it attains speed around your belly button (SvaadhishTaana), acquires speed with the required wind. If, let us say, we wanted to curse, the initial reaction may be to produce whatever vile words we can. As the Vak moves into the Pashyanti stage at Anahata, it is moderated by 'Buddhi'. It is buddhi which tells us what to control and what to let loose. Pure 'Manas' would have made us utter all the vile curses, whereas Buddhi would moderate us. When Vak moves to Madhyama, other layered requirements such as which language to use, which intonation to use, etc., tonal qualities such as loudness, pitch etc., are decided. The content does not change from Madhyama to Vaikhari. Vak is executed via Vaikhari in its 'the then' form by moving the various muscles as required. It is obvious that this is a completely separate step since we may need to take a breath, etc., and hence pause in the middle of cursing. From a network stack analogy, I cannot see why Shri Karve would say Pashyanti and Madhyama are the same, unless he wants to collapse the entire process into calling it as one stack. To me this is unacceptable. The processes identified already are qualitatively and quantitatively different in these four stages, so I believe we cannot and should not call the detailed explanations given by the great seers as wrong. It is quite possible Shri Karve may still have a reasoning for his comments or a pramana, but unless that is made clear, I can't see why it is acceptable.

  

Best Regards,

Krishna Kumar Pillalamarri
