Namaste,

  

The thread initiator had mentioned that he has a copy of Svayamprakasayati's commentary.  

  

There are 2 earlier editions of Svayamprakasayati's commentary on Harimeede stotra (Haristuti).

  

1\. Sri Sankara Bhagavadpadiya Prakarana Prabandhavali Volume 2 - Alladi Mahadeva Sastri 1899 (Mysore)  

2\. Harimide Stotra with Vyakhya of Svayamprakasa Yati - Achyutananda Giri 1887 (Nirnayasagar)

  

regards  
shankara
