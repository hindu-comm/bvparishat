Friends,

Let me remind you with my request.  

I need help with pointers to freedom songs in any language composed during the Freedom Movement.

Nagarajji has sent me two Telugu songs.

Here are two (my selection) from Odisha, the first one in Sanskrit

Please help if you can. We will acknowledge.  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
