Dear friends,

Good morning.

We are proceeding for our seventh seminar in the series

"Let us explore the Cultural History of India" on Nov 2.

The seminar will cover the period 1800AD-1947AD.  

Anybody in this list is invited to attend as our guest.

I have a request to make. For the occasion I wish to  

compile the principal freedom songs in all the local

languages. I need pointers to two each in a language.

It would help if you can send me the youtube link or

the lyrics with a synopsis. I will appreciate receiving

the information by Oct 25.  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
