According to what I have read, Savarkar was in England as a student when he composed this poem. It was later set to music by Hridaynath Mangeshkar and sung by the entire Mangeshkar family, and it has become by far the most popular patriotic song in Marathi. Here is the Marathi text and its English translation I found on the web:

  

****जयोऽस्तुते श्रीमहन्मंगले । शिवास्पदेशुभदे

स्वतंत्रतेभगवति। त्वामहंयशोयुतांवंदे

राष्ट्राचे चैतन्यमूर्ततूंनीति संपदांची

स्वतंत्रतेभगवति।श्रीमती राज्ञी तू त्यांची

परवशतेच्या नभांततूंचीआकाशी होशी

स्वतंत्रतेभगवती।चांदणीचमचमलखलखशी।।

****गालावरच्या कुसुमी किंवा कुसुमांच्या गाली

स्वतंत्रतेभगवती।तूच जी विलसतसेलाली

तूंसूर्याचे तेज उदधिचे गांभीर्यहितूंची

स्वतंत्रतेभगवती। अन्यथाग्रहणनष्टतेंची।।

****

मोक्षमुक्ति ही तुझीचरूपेंतुलाचवेदांती

स्वतंत्रतेभगवतीIयोगिजन परब्रह्मवदती

जे जे उत्तम उदात्त उन्नत महन्मधुरतें तें

स्वतंत्रतेभगवती।सर्वतव सहचारीहोते।।

****

हेअधमरक्तरंजिते।सुजन-पूजिते!श्रीस्वतंत्रते

तुजसाठिंमरणतेंजनन

तुजविण जनन ते मरण

तुज सकलचराचर शरण

स्वतंत्रतेभगवतीIत्वामहंयशोयुतांवंदे।।

*****Victory to you, O Auspicious One, the Munificent and Holy!*

*O Goddess of Freedom, I seek you blessings for success*

*****You are the embodiment of our national spirit, our morality and our accomplishments*

*O glorious Goddess of Freedom, you are the Queen of righteousness*

*****In the dark skies of enslavement*

*O Goddess of Freedom, you are the shining star of hope.*

*Whether on flowers as soft as cheeks, or on cheeks as soft as flowers!*

*O Goddess of Freedom, You are that blush of confidence!*

*****You are the radiance of the Sun, the majesty of the Ocean*

*O Goddess of Freedom, but for you the Sun of Freedom is eclipsed.*

****

*O Goddess of Freedom, you are the face of eternal happiness and liberation,*

*That is why the scriptures hail you as the supreme soul.*

*All that is ideal, magnificent and sweet,*

*O Goddess of Freedom, is associated with you*

****

*You are the destroyer of evil (stained with their blood), O Goddess of Freedom*

*Life is to die for you,*

*Death is to live without you.*

*All creation surrenders unto you!*

****

*Victory to you, O Auspicious One, the Munificent and Holy!*

*O Goddess of Freedom, I seek you blessings for success*
