Please send the date of composition.

  

While I appreciate people helping, I do see friends not being particular about the details.

This has been the stark difference between the old Indian scholarship and the new

India's scholarship. Let me again write what I need.

  

1. I want to compile a collection of poems written in pre-independence India with the

 intent of liberation.  

.2. We do it in BVP with our input that the songs had affected us and we remember  

 either through our family or through our schooling.

  

I hope I succeed in collecting this information. I have to wrap up by the 25th.

Since we are in the process of "India Discovery" the experiment also gives me a

glimpse of what the attitude to research is now compared to when I left forty five

years ago. We seem to care for words that were written more than a thousand years

ago and not care for events a hundred years ago! We have to dig ourselves deeper

for India's shine in world. Let our memory be sharp and let our research teach!

We can't just be hopeful, we are the signature of the country!

  

Please help what you can. I appreciate.  

I am attaching a copy of the Press Release I wrote yesterday.

  

Thank you.

Bijoy Misra
