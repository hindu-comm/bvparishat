I have included Vande Mataram.

Songs should have been composed before independence.  

  

Friends,

Let me clarify what I need.  

I need two poems in each Indian language written before 1947 that we think would have national importance.

Please check back in your memory and consider in view of the national awakening.

I have now gotten items in Urdu, Telugu, Tamil, Marathi, Bengali and Odia. I have recruited singers.

Need help with Malayali, Kannada, Gujarati, Hindi and any other local language.   

Thank you for your help.

Bijoy Misra
