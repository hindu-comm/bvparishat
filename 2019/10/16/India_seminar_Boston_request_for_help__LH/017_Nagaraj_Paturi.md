Is there ought you need that my hands withhold,  
Rich gifts of raiment or grain or gold?  
Lo ! I have flung to the East and the West  
Priceless treasures torn from my breast,  
And yielded the sons of my stricken womb  
To the drum-beats of the duty, the sabers of doom.  
Gathered like pearls in their alien graves  
Silent they sleep by the Persian waves,  
Scattered like shells on Egyptian sands,  
They lie with pale brows and brave, broken hands,  
they are strewn like blossoms mown down by chance  
On the blood-brown meadows of Flanders and France.  
Can ye measure the grief of the tears I weep  
Or compass the woe of the watch I keep?  
Or the pride that thrills thro' my heart's despair  
And the hope that comforts the anguish of prayer?  
And the far sad glorious vision I see  
Of the torn red banners of victory?  
when the terror and the tumult of hate shall cease  
And life be refashioned on anvils of peace,  
And your love shall offer memorial thanks  
To the comrades who fought on the dauntless ranks,  
And you honour the deeds of the dauntless ones,  
Remember the blood of my martyred sons!
