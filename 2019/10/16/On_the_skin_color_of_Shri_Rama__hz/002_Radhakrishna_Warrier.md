Mūrtis in the traditional temples (which were constructed at least two hundred years before present) that I have visited so far have not been life-like. At least, this is the case in south Indian traditional temples. As far as I understand, the sculptors sculpt the mūrtis according to some traditional formulas, depending on who the deity is that the mūrti represents.

Regards,

Radhakrishna Warrier
