I am sorry that I forgot or did not give the reference to the text.

It is from the book, Mahabharat translated by Bibek Debroy which can be downloaded from the internet for free.

The noted sentence occurs in Shanti Parva, chapter 1357(29) of the book. I am including few more lines to provide the context:

  

"When Rama ruled over the kingdom, each cow yielded a bucket of milk. The immensely ascetic one roamed around in the forest for fourteen years. He then performed ten horse sacrifices, at which a lot of gifts were given, with no bars on entry. He was dark and handsome, with red eyes. He was like a mad elephant in his valour. Rama ruled over the kingdom for ten thousand years. O Srinjaya! He was four times as fortunate as you and more meritorious than your son. When he died, why are you grieving about your son? "

  

It is for the first time I see such description of Shri Rama. I can understand eyes becoming red in anger or after crying, but here it says that Rama had red eyes. Rama is dark like Krishna and Jagannath. Color has important cosmological significance.

Also humans use color to classify and discriminate.

  

Between the above three, only Jagannath is seen as black not simply dark.

  

I understand that the sculptor uses the rock he finds or gets. In a way it does not matter by which color one views God, God is Nirakar ( no form) and Adrushya ( invisible), Ananta ( has no end: infinite in extent) and is everywhere( sarbatra).

My question was purely academic in nature.

Like to thank all for their replies.
