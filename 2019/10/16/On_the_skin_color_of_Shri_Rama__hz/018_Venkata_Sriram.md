'red eyes' is wrong translation. It should have been 'lotus-like eyes' because the lakshyArtha is to be taken. This shows lack of 'poetic heart'.

  

However, there was an occasion when Ramachandra reddened His eyes by displaying His anger against Samudra.

  

समुद्रस्य ततः क्रुद्धो रामो **रक्तान्तलोचनः**\|  
समीपस्थम् उवाच इदम् लक्ष्मणम् शुभ लक्ष्मणम् (6.21.13)

  

Here, it should be understood as 'eyes reddened with anger'.

  

rgs,

sriram
