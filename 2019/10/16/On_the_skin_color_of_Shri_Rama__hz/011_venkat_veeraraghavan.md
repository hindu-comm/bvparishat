Reddish cornered eyes is a Mahapurusha lakshana in the great Kavyas.

This has nothing to do with crying or anger.

Not just Rama but Sita as well had a similar eye coloring as described in the Valmiki Ramayana.

  

I have seen some rare cases in certain Yogis with perpetually reddish tinted eyes... asanas like shirshasana and other similar asanas send a lot more blood to the upper half of the body. In certain Yogis this state happens without having to invert the body. Urdhvareta Yogis and such who have achieved stability of bindu display this characteristic.
