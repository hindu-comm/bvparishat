While reading a translation of Mahabharat, I came across in the Shanti parva that

“ He was dark and handsome with red eyes”

My question is if that is correct translation ?

A corollary question is what was the color of one of his typical subject?

  

Interested in authentic answers only.

  

The answers are important today in view of the proposed construction of the Rama mandir in Ayodhya,

Thank you.
