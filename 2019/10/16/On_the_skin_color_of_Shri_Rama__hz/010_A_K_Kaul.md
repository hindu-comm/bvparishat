Dear Shri Pattanayakji,

Jai Shri Ram!

What sounded somewhat odd to me was the sentence "Rama ruled over the kingdom for ten thousand years" since I recalled that several decades back, I had read some similar statement in the Mahabharata (and perhaps in some Puranas also!) but that was 11000 years!

Many thanks for giving the exact references which made my job easy\|

It is the BORI edition that has talked of 10000 years of "Ramarajya"दशवर्ष सहस्राणि रामो राज्यमकारयत which Bibek Debroy has quoted whereas the Neelakanthai edition, Kumbakonam edition and the South Indian edition talk of दशवर्ष सहस्राणि दशवर्ष शतानि च exactly what the Valmiki Ramayana has said!

The Gita Press edition of the Mahabharata follows Neelakantha, that means BORI edition is not correct here.

I am attaching the following references:

1\. Ramarajya10000yrs is from BORI edition

2\. Ramarajya11000yrs is from Neelakantha edition

3\. Ramarajya11000yrsSIedn. is from South Indian edition

4\. Ramarajya11000yrsku is from Kumbakonam edition

Though it is a bit off the relevant topic of the "colour of the eyes of Bhagwan Ram" but it is a further proof of the fact that the horoscopes of Bhagwan Ram that are floating around are absolutely wrong and it is next to impossible to determine the exact date of that divine Incarnation-----including that of 12000 BCE------on the basis of astrological interpolations in the epics since He is supposed to have ruled for 11000 years both in the VR and the Mbh etc.

The same thing applies to the dates of Incarnation of Bhagwan Krishna and the date of the Mahabharata war.

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!

A K Kaul
