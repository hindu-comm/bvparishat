Namaste,

  

My rAmAyaNa teacher once said that certain attributes are used out of '***poetic imagination***' and has to be understood from the perspective of

alamkAra-shAstra.

  

Just replaceलोहिताक्षः with **पुण्डरीकाक्षः** and it resolves the issue. It also fits poetically which means 'having lotus-like eyes with reddish tinge'.

  

rgs,

sriram
