Hello Irene,

  

  You can begin with Bimal Krishna Matilal'sbook: *The Navya-Nyāya Doctrine of Negation: The Semantics and Ontology of Negative Statements in Navya-Nyāya Philosophy*, Harvard Oriental Series. There are articles by Frits Staal, J.L. Shaw and others on Negation in logic and in Buddhist Philosophy. I can give you a list, if you need. Numerous works on *Apoha* also deal with negation from a Buddhist point of view.
In Sanskrit, the *Nañ-Vāda* of Raghunātha Śiromaṇi is the most well known work focusing on Negation.
