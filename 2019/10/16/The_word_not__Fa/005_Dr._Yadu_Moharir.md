Namaste Subbu-Ji

  

This concept of "neti.... neti" is probably the most scientific methodology, and is not just accepted by scientists but practiced religiously by them.  

  

I look at this as an expedition to find the truth.

If we consider the Veda to be the texts earlier than any other written texts, we have one famous instance of negation:

  

अथात आदेशो नेति नेति न ह्येतस्मादिति नेत्यन्यत्परमस्त्यथ
..Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 2.3.6 'Neti Neti....' There is no better indicator for Brahman other than 'not this, not this' by negating everything that is not Brahman.
