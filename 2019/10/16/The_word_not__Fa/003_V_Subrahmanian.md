If we consider the Veda to be the texts earlier than any other written texts, we have one famous instance of negation:

  

अथात आदेशो नेति नेति न ह्येतस्मादिति नेत्यन्यत्परमस्त्यथ
..Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 2.3.6 'Neti Neti....' There is no better indicator for Brahman other than 'not this, not this' by negating everything that is not Brahman.
