Respected Scholars of the BVP group,

## This is to bring to your kind notice that the J. N. University, Delhi is coordinating a cultural event title “Rasa-kirti” in JNU campus on 19^(th) October, 2019, (5-00 pm). JNU is collaborating with “Satra-ranga”, a cultural organization, which undertakes projects promoting Indian culture & heritage with emphasis on North-East Culture all over the world.

## This project is being conceptualized with an aim to research, analysis, explore and presenting Kalidasa’s Abhijnaanas’akuntalaa Natakam in Sanskrit & Prakrit texts. It is developed in a Satriya style (  सत्रीय शैली ) of Dramatic techniques of Shrimanta S’ankaara Deva, a 15^(th) century great saint of Assam, as a part of a Production Oriented Workshop, will be directed by eminent Sattriya exponent Adhyapaka Dr. Bhabanand Barbayan. The project In-charge of "Rasa-kirti" is Prof. Rajnish Kumar Mishra, JNU.

## The uniqueness of this project is that the drama will be based on the Kashmiri recension of the Abhijnaanas’akuntalaa, अभिज्ञानशकुन्तला नाटकम् । edited ( from the Shaaradaa manuscripts ) by Prof. Vasantkumar M. Bhatt ( Ahmedabad ), which has been considered as the oldest ( 7^(th) century ) and most authentic text of this drama. ( The popular Devanagari version of this drama ( अभिज्ञानशाकुन्तलम् )belongs to 16^(th) century and the Maithili & Bengali versions ( अभिज्ञानशकुन्तलम् ) are later than the text of Kashmiri recension. )

## Additionally, one of the primary objectives of the project is to create awareness of Sanskrit, Prakrit and Shrimant S’ankaedev’s teachings, which focuses on enriching spiritual and artistic ability to enhance individuality & social life. 

All interested persons are invited.
