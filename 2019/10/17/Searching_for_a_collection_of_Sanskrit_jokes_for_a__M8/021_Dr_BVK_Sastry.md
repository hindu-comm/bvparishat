Namaste





For Joke: Samskruth term



How about - 'vainodikii' ( vak, samvaadah, kathanam, kathaa :: a statement, expression, narrative, story - which produces mirth)



Basis: Bharata's Natya shaastra is said to be technically an instrument for ' Vinoda-Karanam loke'- an act to alleviate, lighten the mood, reduce the seriousness, ease the tension, see a flip side expression !



For contemplation please.

BVK Sastry

Was thinking of the word for joke in Sanskrit or other Indian languages.
