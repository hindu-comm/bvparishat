In Malayalam, parihāsam means ridicule, or making fun of someone or something. Parihāsam cannot be an innocent joke, it is always at the expense of someone or something. For joke, the word used in Malayalam is tamāśa which is from Hindi/Urdu tamāśā. A more native term is nērampōkkŭ which literally means time pass (nēram + pōkkŭ). In Sanskritized Malayalam the word for joke is narmam (നർമ്മം नर्मम्)

Regards,

Radhakrishna Warrier
