Shankara ji, thank you for the references, Iâ€™ll start searching for copies of these books.  
Subbu ji, as usual, your WhatsApp adventures bring us gems. You probably could single-handedly run a joke thread on BVP, considering how much new stuff you bring in. Actually, if such a thread is set up, everyone could deposit the jokes they hear or read there.
