Was thinking of the word for joke in Sanskrit or other Indian languages.

  

In Telugu , I realized that the word parāchikamu (singular) parāchikālu (plural) and navvulāṭa (singular) were being used.

  

 parāchikamu (singular) parāchikālu (plural) is a tadbhava coming from parihāsika/parihāsaka and navvulāṭa (singular) is a dēśya.

  

 parihāsa should then be the Sanskrit word for joke.  

  

 navvulāṭa is a joking act or joking as act but not a joke.  

  

One could say idi parāchikamu = this is a joke. ivi parāchikālu = these are jokes. But navvulāṭa can not be used that way. One can say 
navvulāṭaku annānu = I said this just as a joke. But literally
navvulāṭaku is navvulāṭa + ku = for joking . So navvulāṭaku annānu = I said this for joking.

  

But in Sanskrit , it is possible to say parihāsōyam. So parihāsa can be a word for joke.
