It seems to me that the model described in the Vedic literature offers fundamentally a different and holistic model of speechmechanism. The "anahata" nada seems to me to be the natural oscillations or resonances( their nature and characteristic by definition is independent of source, see the reference below) related to the intrinsic elements of the entire universe and particularly manifested within a being. It will relatein my opinion to all potential nadas that can be experienced by the particular being. The "ahata" nada is related to the forced oscillations or nada with all its characteristics like varnah,svarah,matra,balam,sama, and santanah.

The role of the muladhara chakra that is the end of the spinal chord is particularly of importance. Together with the role of other organs corresponding to the four stages of nada the Vedic ideas may offer an alternate understanding of physiological and neurological mechanisms of nada(speech). The role of brain may implicitly be related through smruti and its neural connections to the muladhar chakra through the spinal chord.

Of particular interest to me is experimentally explaining matra, the various time delays in speech and its recognition.

I will like to continue on this thread offline with people interested in discussing further on what I stated above. My email is [dmg...@gmail.com]().

with best regards

The key view presented in this work is that resonances are associated with solutions without a source or incident field. The above paper dealt with nuclear resonances, but the concept is applicable to sound and light fields.
