Respected Prof. Kannan Ji,

Namaste !

It was a grand success ! The play was organized by the JNU, Delhi on it's golden jubilee year. I was fortunate enough to be there as a text editor of the Kashmiri recension. Not less than 800 Sanskrit students and teachers of Delhi have watched it.

\(1\) So, they have recorded, and after necessary editing the video DVD will be released, hopefully. (2) Even the Director of the play in "Sattriya style", Adhyapak Bhabanand Barbayan, has arranged it's video shooting by some Assamiya Cameraman ( Mr. Maram ). So , please wait for the release of that video.

\(3\) The daily newspaper "The Hindu" will publish it's review article tomorrow, 25th October, 2019.

Regards,

Vasantkumar M Bhatt
