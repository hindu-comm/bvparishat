You may consider the Brāhmaṇa literature as a form of early commentary on the Saṃhitās of the respective Vedas. The Nirvacanas in the Nirukta certainly have their origin in the Nirvacanas provided in the Brāhmaṇas. The Brāhmaṇas predate the formation of the Padapāṭha, although the Āitareya Āraṇyaka refers to Śākalya and the Padapāṭha, and hence the Padapāṭha was most likely produced at the tail-end of the Brāhmaṇa-Āraṇyaka period.
