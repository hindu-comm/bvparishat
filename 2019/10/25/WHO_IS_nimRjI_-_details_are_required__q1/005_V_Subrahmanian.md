There are many variations even across Apasthamha-followers in Sandhya ritual: Kannada (and Telugu, I am not sure), during Maadhyahnikam, do the surya upasthaanam first and then do the actual sandhya vandanam.
This is not a practice among Tamils. So too, the shloka 'shivaaya vishnurupaaya......' is chanted by Kannada and Telugu people at all the three sandhyas daily. This is also not in Tamils. The very achamanam is different. For Tamils it is only 12 names but for Kannada and Telugus it is 24 names. They touch parts of legs also.
