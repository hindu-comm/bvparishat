Ok, sure, sir.

  

What I sent included "**N.of the god of love"**also, apart****the other usual meanings of namuchi.

Thats the reason why I speculated it could be namuchi and sent it.

  

(btw, I am very sure we do not offer tarpaNa to asura-s)

Since you confirm it is निमृजी, I too look forward to be informed about it.
