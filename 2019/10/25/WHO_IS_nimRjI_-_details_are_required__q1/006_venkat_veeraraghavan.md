Interesting you should mention achamana.  

While the Achyutaya namah Anantaya namah etc is the std pauranic version in TN,

in Karnataka the (Gokarna version) gives 3 different versions of achamana

1\. Rg vedaya svaha, Yajurvedayasvaha etc

2\. ApohishTa..

2\. Achamana with mahavyahrtis

  

Also people around the Narmada region have the Narmada Vandana and Astika's mantra to drive away snakes with malevolent intention.

  

Quite the melange.

  

As professor Kannan said a thousand versions of Sandhya.
