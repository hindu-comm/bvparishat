Is this one of the tarpanas that you give as per apastambha sutra during sandhyavandana?

I am curious to know myself because I was under the impression that Sandhyavandana is standardised across Sutras irrespective of differences in desha.

  

A friend from Andhra told me that he gives these Tarpanas ..some of which do not occur in the Tamil version of the apastambha sandhyavandana..  
Try writing to or asking the "usual suspect " ;-) Shri Korada Garu who should be able to help you with this because I believe he is also a follower of apastambha sutra.
