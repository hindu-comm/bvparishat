Thank you Narenthiran-ji, for the ToC of the book.

You have taken much trouble.

  

A little more "greed" of prospective readers:

as the topics and the authors are not all very well-known,

proffering an idea about the Contributors (and their standing)

would help us guesstimate better the credentials of the production.

  

Bother not if it is too troublesome.
