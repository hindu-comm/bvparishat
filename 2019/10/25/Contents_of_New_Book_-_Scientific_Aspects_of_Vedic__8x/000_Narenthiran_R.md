Dear All,  

Happy Diwali!

For quite some time I was not posted any "contents" due to my official mission. Today kindly see attached contents of "New book". Its a collection of articles of 12th International Conference in association with 20th India Conference at Bharatiya Vidy Bhavan. New Delhi. The theme "Scientific Aspects of Vedic knowledge" held in December 15-18, 2016.  

Thanks
