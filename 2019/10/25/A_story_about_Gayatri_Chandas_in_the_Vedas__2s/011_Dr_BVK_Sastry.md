Namaste



1. I do understand to a decent extant the tamil discourse; the one in the referred you tube by Veda brahma shri Rajagopala Ghanpatigal.

Ghanpathigal and myself were closely associated on some projects and worked together.

2. Your \<Hence> and original question is a mix up of Veda and Purana frame works : \< Gayatri (originally with only 4 letters)(Garuda in the Puranas) returns victorious with not just the Soma lata but also the 2 aksharas each per pada dropped by Jagati and Trishtup. Hence Gayatri now has 8 aksharas per pada. Can someone give a fuller version of this story, its reference and esoteric context? >

3. My response was to address this mix up in your question, starting with \< Hence ... \> in relation to subject line : \<A story about Gayatri Chandas in the Vedas>.



 The answer to all your questions are provided with pointers in the same pravachan, in the explanation of how gayatri as a chandas, gayatri as a mantra (vishwamitra gayatri)

and a specific devataa gayatri differ. 



3. The power of different Vedic chandas in relation to each mantra-sukta is a practical meditation issue, explained in detail in the vedic full passage. 

What should be the norm to chant / do japa / for a 'mantra called Gayatri'? for a mantra which carries the tag of 'gayatri chandas' ?
should it be same or different ?

Should the upaasanaa be from a Chandas 'shaastra perspective by akshara-maatra or devataa perspective? Answers will be found is anukramanis as guidance for viniyoga.

According to Mantranukramani's , when Devataa part of the Gayatri is used for upasanaa, the phala is different. The ground level practice in paurohitya and aagma temple worship of today is at variance in many ways.





4. When Chandas part of mantra is used for gayatri upaasanaa ( a Vak-yoga tradition, from Shaunaka - Rushi devataa -chandas anukramani's ) the significance of 'atma-roopayoh (16.50 of video) ' will become meaningful. The esoteric context of kadru story, drawn from 'Veda mantra', has this technical word ' Atma-Roopayoh aspardheta '. This points answers to your seeking.



 The Purana context of kadru story is different from Kadru- vinuta
narrative in the veda mantra. When one starts reading the 'veda mantra' with the 'equivalence model of vocabulary from Purana', the exit from the traditional norm is clear. The 'sampuabrumhana of vedaartha from 'itihasa -puranaabhyaam' means take the guidance of symbolism ( prateeka / Pratimaa / Upamaa ) in itihaasa and Purana to seek the purpose of Veda and modalities of Practice.



 If one really goes by this stand of tradition, Mahabharata and its characters , incidents are Yoga-Shaastra; Ramayana is esoteric Kundalini yoga. If this line is given up, Veda- Ramayana- itihaasa are time distanced , context character separated historic narrative. When the character ' Kadru' of Purana is taken as equivalent of ' Vedic concept: kadru -vinata', the error is obvious in the outcome. 



5. When swadhyaayi's make creative constructions and equivalence of Vedic term-context mapping it to the narrative in Purana ( by giving up the Shadanga Vedanga / Nirukta sampradaya / Sayana Bhaahsya ) the outcome is the kind of question you have posted. This is the kind of root error that was done on a greater scale by vedic researchers of west, using the 'word -similarity' across different languages, texts and contexts to explain history of Bharath and practices of (Hindoo ) Brahmin's ! and peacefully, passively tolerated for three centuries by the 'guardians of vedas' . Sorry if this statement hurts the pride and disturbs the peace of some others.
