Namaste



1. On \< Hence Gayatri now has 8 aksharas per pada.\> : Are you drawing a logical conclusion and QED on what should be Gaayatri ??



Why is there a mix up of the models of classical Chandas definition ( Pingala or Kedara bhatta) - a human composition guidance for 'maatraa- kaala- pramana of varna-akshara flow ' for yaajnika vinyoga/ practice of veda mantra with Vak-Yoga model guidance with 'Vedic -Darshana'- an outcome of Yoga-anushthana-janya darshana -shruti as
'Gayatri-darshana' ?



Did Rushi Vishwamtira say Gayatri is only six aksharas ? The mantra gives only the name of the Chandas. What then is Chandas ? Is it ' akshara- maatra -pramaana' Or ' Chadi - aacchdane / aahlaadane: What wraps and yields ultimate protection and Aananda ?



Are we teaching 'Chandas' -Rushi-Devataa' significance to any of the Vedic research scholars , even though tradition shouts at the top of its voice : avidita -aarsheya chando daivatam mantram.......'.... yajati
... yaajayati vaa.... sa - paapeeyaan bhavati ' - ?? . 



 The same issue applies to the debate of three -paadas / fourth paada / veda association with each paada of gayatri mantra / Gayatri open initiation for all (?- Asamksrutha Veda mantra ?? - mantro heenah, svarato varanto vaa, mithyaa prayukto na tamartham aaha ). The upanayana samskaara is also called ' Saavitrii - vrata/ saavitri upadesha where 'Gayatri mantra' is initiated by guru to shishya for ' anushthaana'- purascharana' - sadhanaa. It is not for tarka- jijnyaaaa.



 Everyone has their 'datta -swaatantrya / freedom of academics' to work with Veda, quoting the statement ' jaata-maatrasya -gaayatri' in an out of context scenario. When ever these positional statements of tradition are said, they are constructed differently, as it hurts the
pride of secular Vedantin's and Hindus. My humble request and
recommendation: safely relegate discussion on Vedas out of academics. **'Vedas are NOT script /Scriptures equivalent of Religions'**. Gita, Ramayana, Mahabharata serve this purpose better.



 Hindusim can stay with all its pride and heritage values anchored to Ramayana, Gita and Mahabharata as history/ mystic / scripture , as explained in 'World Religion studies'.

The moment 'Ramayana, Gita and Mahabharata' are linked to Vedic Continuum and purpose of Moksha, Lo! loads of bricks will come down on speakers head. 



2. The esoteric part understanding of the narrative is meant for graded upaasanaa; not for public entertainment discourse. The statement \< Jagati and Tristhtup first try and drop 2 aksharas each from their original count and return unsuccessful. \> means the right and wrong ways of experimental upaasanaa with Gayatri for a particular goal. Wrong usage yields wrong results. The Code does run, but returns an error output.



 The directive in Shaastra-sampradaaya ( right from earlier times ) is ' Itihaasa- Purnaabhyaam, Vedaartham samupabrumhayet'. Coherent amplification is not dissecting for postmortem.



 The analysis of ' Purana / even vedic upaakhyaana' narrative as a bed time story is not the recommended line for 'Swa-Adhyaaya': Self constructed models of Studying and interpreting the Vedas.



3. Shubha Deepavali for all.
