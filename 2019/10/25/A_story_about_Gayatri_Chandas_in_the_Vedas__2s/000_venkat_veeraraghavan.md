Dear Vidvans,

  

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7yCxP1JPic>  

  

In the above video from 17 to 23 minutes you find a slightly different story of the competition between Kadru and Suvarni (Vinata in puranas) where Kadru wins and Suvarni becomes her slave.

As the price for redemption from slavery, Kadru demands the Soma lata(amrita in puranas) from the 3rd loka. Suvarni's children the chandas' Jagati and Tristhtup first try and drop 2 aksharas each from their original count and return unsuccessful.

  

Gayatri (originally with only 4 letters)(Garuda in the Puranas) returns victorious with not just the Soma lata but also the 2 aksharas each per pada dropped by Jagati and Trishtup.

  

Hence Gayatri now has 8 aksharas per pada.

  

Can some one give a fuller version of this story, its reference and esoteric context?

  

Thanks,

  

Venkat
