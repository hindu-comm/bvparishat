Namaste Prof. KSK

  

  

Thanks for going through my response post to venkat veeraghavan; and taking note of the 'good intentions' in theresponse, although it
might seem confusing and a strain to figure out what s being said.
Unfortunately, there are no simple ways to answer a complexly noodled
question, when it comes on a Scholarly forum and respond simple story modelnarration. Surely schoalrs like you will ask for reference, authority.

  

Some times it needs hard head and strong heart to stand by tradition without compromise and call a spade a spade; and get a stick from a friend..

  

The QED part in Venkat Veeraraghavan post read \< \< Hence Gayatri now has 8 aksharas per pada.\>. If one contemplates why this is a point of confusion , the backdrop emerges as below. If the reasoned response is not relevant for the vidwans of the forum, please drop it out. If the pointed fact is more than good intention , then please take for what it is worth.

  

*Facts of the case stand as below:* Gayatri is also name of a family of metres. The number of syllables can vary from 26 to 19. The Gayatri metre has as many as 10 variants.. The Nichruth Gayatri is one such variant. Apart from differences in the number of syllables, more variants occur due to the padas. Some variants of Gayatri have 5 padas.
Some of them have formations such as : 5\|5\|5\|5\|6, 5\|5\|5\|4\|6, 6\|7\|11, 7\|7\|7\|, 7\|6\|6 etc and all of them belong to the Gayatri family of metre. The Gayatri mantra that appears in RV 3.62.10 is having 23 syllables. Even in the classical reference, Katyayana's Anukramanika, Katyayana calls the 23-syllabled metre by the name Gayatri only. (Source:
<https://hinduism.stackexchange.com/questions/17783/metrical-restoration-of-gayatri-mantra>). More esoteric details can be seen at
<https://sreenivasaraos.com/tag/gayatri-savitri/> .

  

Textabout Gayatri in connection with Shyena and other (birds ?) like suparna comes in Krishna Yajurveda - Third Kanda - second prapahtaka - onwards in connection with Pavamana Soma-Third to ninth suktas). The technicality of yajna -dhyana- viniyoga here helps one to understand the purana story of Kadru where the term ' atmaroopayoh'- comes in. ( <https://www.shastras.com/vedas/krishna-yajur-veda/> - page 176 of text) .

  

The story of Kadru and Vinata as an ithasa legend coming in
Mahabharata - Adi parva \\ Astika Parva \\ section XVI -to-XX. ( <https://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m01/m01021.htm>). Link given by shankara. The Mahabharata story gets transposed to purana versions with a different flavor and symbolism. And ends up with the construct of classical rivalry between 'Garuda and Serpents' to become a popular story. This is how original 'Vision' of Veda, locked in symbolism of Itihasa- Purana transposes to popular faith endorsement of rivalry
between Garuda birds and serpent reptiles.

Each text-section of tradition has a specific purpose and context. When this gets mixed up in the question itself, with ' words transposed out of context', the clarification to explain the source of confusion and resolution of the same. becomes complex.

  

That was my ' good intention' and 'contention' on why-how such questions need to be seen in the frame of 'tradition'. The essence of post was not to confuse the 'Veda-artha' with ' purana-pravachana-artha' and draw QED statements.
