Dear Shri Sastry Garu,

  

Let me make the original question in my post plain. I think there is some confusion that I have inadvertently transmitted.

There is a Tamil video by a Ghanapaati who tells a story. Since many of the BVP Vidvans are not Tamils, I did a transcribe of the story (not word for word) so that people can get a sense of the portion of the video in question.

The rest would have been obvious to the Vidvans since they were Samskrta.

I sincerely assure you I do not come here for bed time stories (although the original post was made last night) or entertainment.

Now, what I was asking for was source of the story told and bhashyas if any from the major commentators.

I hope this clarifies the scope of the question.

  

Thanks,

  

Venkat
