Dear Shri Sastry Garu,  

  

Thanks for the clarification.

As I said, I was merely transcribing (not word for word) and adding my version of the Pauranic parallel.

Interestingly in most other sources the name of the other sister is Suparni and not Suvarni as given in the video.

It is traditionally believed that Garuda represents the Veda. I was merely making a connection there. I have no illwill towards the tradition as you well know. Unless one asks one cannot get answers.

Maybe my question was not well phrased given that it was composed late night.

  

Kind Regards,

  

Venkat
