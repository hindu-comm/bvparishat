\<\< Exhaustive survey!>\>

  

Sir, thank you for the appreciation.

  

\<\<वाचा, निशा, दिशा are particular cases;it cannot be indiscriminately extended to all हलन्त-s.\>\>

  

The same thing applies in case ofअल्लोप of the prefixesअव, अपि, अधि, अभि as well. अल्लोप occurs only in case of highly limited dhAtus. Althoughभागुरि does not explicitly mention it, but the post-PaaNinan grammarians have definitely done it (in case of अव and अपि), as already pointed out in my article.

  

Regards

Narayan Prasad
