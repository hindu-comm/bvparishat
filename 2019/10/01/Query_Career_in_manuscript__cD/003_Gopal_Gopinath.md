At IIT Mumbai, efforts are on to read,curate and annotate old, time-worn manuscripts dealing with math and astronomy. I understand there is always a room for students willing to take up such complex projects.
There is also excellent scholarship in residence there. Pl contact Prof Ramasubramananian.
