Gitagovinda, traditionally, is associated, apart from the field of music, with the field of dance only.

  

Originally found as a central text for Odissi dance form, it has been borrowed into the other solodance forms of India too. Kuchipudi which is originally a Yakshagana theatrical dance form, developed its own solo dance sub-genres. One of them is ashTapadis too .

  

Thus you can find numerous YouTube videos for ashTapadi performances.
