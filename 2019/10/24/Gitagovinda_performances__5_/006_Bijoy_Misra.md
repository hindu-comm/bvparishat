Geetagovinda performance is a major component in most Odissi dance compositions.

Apparently it was mandated in 15th century that only geetagovinda may be performed

in the temple at Puri as an evening offering to Jagannatha. The tradition is old and deep.

Here is a performance by late guru Kelucharan Mahapatra.
