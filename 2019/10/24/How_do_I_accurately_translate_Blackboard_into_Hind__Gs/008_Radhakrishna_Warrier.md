I think‡§´‡§≤‡§ï (phalak) is a good translation for board in Hindi. In Malayalam, we use phalakam in the same sense. In Malayalam, there is a word "palaka" which means plank. It looks to me that this word palaka is a tadbhava of Sanskrit phalaka.

  

On another note, I had my primary education till class 4 in Delhi.
After that, my father got transfer to the home state and we all moved to Kerala. I remember using a wooden plank called "takhti" (‡§§‡•ô‡•ç‡§§‡•Ä) for writing copy. I think the word is from Urdu/Persianÿ™ÿÆÿ™€å (takhti).
Everyday I used to paint my takhti white with a special washable paint and when the paint dried, writing my Hindi copy on it with syaahi (ink) and qalam (pen).

  

This video shows how one writes on a takhti:

The video says "‡§¨‡•Ä‡§ö ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§¶‡§µ‡§æ‡§§ ‡§ñ‡•Å‡§≤ ‡§ú‡§æ‡§§‡§æ ‡§•‡§æ". Exactly my experience too.
The davaat gets open and the black syaahi (ink) gets spilled over my bag and shirt. üôÇ
