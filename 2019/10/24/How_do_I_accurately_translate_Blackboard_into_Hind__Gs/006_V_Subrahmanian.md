The question was for a translation into Hindi and not Sanskrit. It should be something like 'कालाफलक' . I resorted to an online English-Hindi dictionary and failed to get a translation for 'board' (what I got was Mandal, samiti, etc.:-) ) Then I gave plank and got phalak... But I think GOI Hindi Dept. or Hindi section of the Education dept of any North Indian state must have a standard Hindi word for this.
