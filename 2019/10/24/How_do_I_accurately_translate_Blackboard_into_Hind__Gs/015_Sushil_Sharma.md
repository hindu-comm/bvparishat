Namaskaara,

  

As someone who grew up in a Hindi-speaking region of India and completed his entire school education in Hindi medium schools, I can attest that the word most commonly heard in 'formal' Hindi for blackboard was 'श्यामपट्ट'. Perhaps there are regional variations and in other parts of India people might be using those words, but I never heard anyone sayकृष्णफलक or श्यामफलक. :-)

  

"Rajpal Hindi Shabdakosha" by Dr. Hardev Bahri (a very prominent name in the field of Hindi lexicography), published by Rajpal & Sons, Delhi (2005), gives 'blackboard' as the meaning for 'श्यामपट्ट'.

  

The मानक अंग्रेज़ी हिन्दी कोश (Standard English-Hindi Dictionary) by Dr. Satya Prakash and Balbhadra Prasad Mishra, published by Hindi Sahitya Sammelan, Prayag, (1971), gives 'श्यामपट्ट' and 'काला तख़्ता' for 'blackboard'.

One can find numerous examples of usage of श्यामपट्ट (in the sense of blackboard) with a simple Google search. For example, see the 1st line on the 3rd page of the PDF at the link below (a Geometry textbook in Hindi, from NCERT) :

Though the venerable Dr. Raghu Vira givesकृष्णफलक and कृष्णपट्ट for blackboard in his "A Comprehensive English-Hindi Dictionary of Governmental and Educational Words and Phrases", published by "International Academy of Indian Culture" in June 1955,... I suspect those words suffered the same fate as thousands of other new Hindi/Sanskrit words coined by him, and never caught on with the popular usage.

  

Regards,

Sushil
