Dear Prof Kannan,

You are an author and have several books to your credit. You know what I am saying. I have over a decade of experience in digitizing. I suggest member's not to venture into the domains of copy-write violations. One may have done with no intention except to that of fair use but I am not sure if fair usage exception is applicable on any book we think that copy write doesn't exist. Nothing in the copy-write act or in its amendments states one can upload copyrighted materials without consent free or cost. As a thumb rule it is better to upload only those books printed prior to 1940. Neither archives will remove or no one can question.

  

To your suggestion on asking [archives.org](http://archives.org) why a book or material has been removed legally speaking only the owner of the rights can ask such a question.

  

If any of our list members are lawyers or attorneys they can best answer the legal part and consequences of violation.

  

Please note all great digitizing initiatives taken up in India and abroad do come to a grinding halt when one does too much publicity. The bottom line of what I am trying to say its best to do digitization silently.

Ajit Gargeswari
