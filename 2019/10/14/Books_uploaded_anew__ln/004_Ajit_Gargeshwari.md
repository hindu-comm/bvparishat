Yes I agree we should create a bibliography of items in public domain as well as those not in pertaining to all aspects of Sanskrit including books articles manuscript in a systematic way giving links from where such materials are available for those materials in public domain. I suggest we open a document or use zotero for the purpose We should have also well thought schema for entering bibliographic details. One should check for uniformity with respect to spellings. Several valuable articles are printed in various commemoration, felicitation books and in specialized journals several of them defunct should be made know to all interested.
