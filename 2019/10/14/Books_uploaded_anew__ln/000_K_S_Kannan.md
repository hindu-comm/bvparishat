I see that Sri Hari Parshad Das has graciously helped students and scholars of Sanskrit  

by uploading into Internet Archive (IA) nearly a dozen books since the commencement of this year.  

There are many other benefactors too who have been rendering a similar service.

  

Obviously these efforts are directed towards benefitting the Sanskrit audience.  

Would it not be desirable, then, if **periodical announcements be made on BVP  
**

**about the books so uploaded?**

  

(First weeks of January, April, July, and October, say,  

could be the choice dates for these announcements.  

Members of BVP can actually look forward to such announcements then).  

(I am not aware if Internet Archive itself has evolved any such scheme).  

  

Rather than stumble upon them accidentally,  

we may get to know *systematically* what items are getting uploaded *anew*.

Service of this sort would indeed be a greater help.

  

(Incidentally and additionally, if someone can figure out what books have been taken down by IA  

(and for what reasons), such notifications would be a help too. And in case some items have been removed

under a wrong apprehension of Copyright violation, IA could even be requested to restore them).
