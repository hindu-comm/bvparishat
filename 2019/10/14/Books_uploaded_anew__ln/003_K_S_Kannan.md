Dear Gargeshwari,

I am by no means recommending violation of copyrights. I am speaking of intimation only of such titles where uploading to Archive has been done without copyrights violations.

  

Harping on not violating copyright law, by yourself and Prof. Paturi, is welcome because members need to be reminded often about it. I am not for any illegal activity.

  

Regards
