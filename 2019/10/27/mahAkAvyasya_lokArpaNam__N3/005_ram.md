Dear Prof. Namputiri,

Thanks a lot for letting us know about the composition of this Kavya. I am delighted to know about this considering the fact that nowadays not many are equipped and/or willing to take this adventurous journey.  

Moreover, since I also personally know that you are one of those scholars of recent times, who possess an impeccable scholarship in grammar as well a deep insights and brilliant imagination, I am sure this should be a wonderful creation that is worth a read.  

Can you please let this forum know the details of the publisher and the way to order copies of the book? I can't wait to see this book and read it (at least sections).  

Thank you so much,  

Best regards,

-ram.
