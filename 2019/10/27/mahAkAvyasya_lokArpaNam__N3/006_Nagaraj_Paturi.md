Dear Prof. Namputiri,

  

Congratulations on the book release of the Kaavyam.

  

It is a testimony to the incessant and eternal creativity of Sanskrit manifesting through vibrant mahaakavis like you.

  

Hope the list will get a brief about the salient features of the book.

  

Warm regards,

  

Nagaraj
