A typo - pure and simple, Sir!

And I have a history of such typos!

A veritable mismatch between rush of thought and gush of 'ink':  

When I was studying in the Fourth Standard,

I had written on the first page of my Kannada Neat Note Book  

"KSKannada"

when I actually wanted to write KSKannan and Kannada.

Unpremeditated unintentional portmanteau words!

(just as we have the (intentional) breakfast + lunch = brunch).

Conflation and confusion passing for fusion!
