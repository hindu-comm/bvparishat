Dear Scholars,  

Namaste.

  
  I am looking for the चम्पू काव्य "निरनुनासिक" of नारायणभट्ट, the author of प्रक्रियासर्वस्वम्. Its brief info is given below.  
  
'\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*  
 नारायणभट्ट composed the प्रक्रियासर्वस्वम् and also a large number of चम्पूs. The usual practice was for him to write a चम्पू in the forenoon and the चाक्यर was to explain it in the afternoon in the court of the king. One of his चम्पूs is निरनुनासिक, in which शूर्पणखा complains, after her being deformed by लक्ष्मण, to रावण; being devoid of her nose she could not pronounce nasal sounds and so the whole चम्पू is composed without a nasal sound. The first verse has the passage:  
  
हा हा राक्षसराज दुष्परिभवग्रस्तस्य धिक् ते भुजाः ।  
  
Here the word भुजा is either masculine or feminine and if he used the second case of it in the masculine plural, there will be a nasal in भुजान् and so he used the feminine form भुजाः. When the चाक्यर explained the passage in the afternoon, he explained it as "I condemn your twenty hands devoid of masculinity". Both the King and the author were very much pleased.
