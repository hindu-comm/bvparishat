Dear Shri Sivasenani ji  

  

You make several interesting points.

  

"When a grihastha seeks alms, we need to keep in mind that he has an establishment back home to support. If he has to carry food back home, he cannot carry cooked food (SishTas do not eat cooked food that has been carried over a public way, or in fact even seen by others). "

--> That is news to me that a SishTa grihastha can not let cooked food be seen in public. Is there a source for this and what is the logic behind this practice? Thanks for the info!

  

But did Grihasthas go out for bhiksha? Did they not survive on uncchavritti and daana? Is there a metric on who can accept bhiksha and who does unchavritti or is this by personal sankalpa?

I was under the impression that since they had an establishment they only collected dravya through unchavritti and daana so that the grihiNi can cook the raw ingredients at home.

  

Regards

  

Venkat
