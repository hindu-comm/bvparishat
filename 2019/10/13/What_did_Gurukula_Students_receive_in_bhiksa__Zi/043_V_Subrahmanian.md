First, apologies for mentioning it as ' Dharmaakuutam commentary ' while this is actually the 'Bhushana' commentary. Dharmaakuutam is not there for this verse, so says the site. The other teekaa-s like Shiromani and Tilaka do not say anything about tarpana; they simply say 'arghya.'

  

To answer your question, I would guess that in some desha/sampradaya-s the deva-rishi tarpanam occurs as part of the praatah sandhyaa worship. Or maybe for Kshatriyas deva-rishi tarpanam is to be done in the morning itself. Many such possibilities can be thoughtof.
