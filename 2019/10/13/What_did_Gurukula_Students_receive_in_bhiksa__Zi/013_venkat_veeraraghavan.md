Dear Shri Damodara ji-

  

I did not say that ISKCON or Gaudiyas are not Vedic. What constitutes "Vedic" is a point of contention between different sects and will not be settled in a BVP post. To each his/her own.

They come under the umbrella of Hinduism, but the question of sufficiency does exist in terms of "Vedic" practice.

Wrt why sourcing achara of other sects would be problematic, let me quote an example...

Consider Snana:

Traditionally Snana across all of Aryavarta involved the following:

1\. Achamana, pranayama and Sankalpa

2\. Achamana with ablinga mantras and Marjana with punyahavachana mantras

3\. Three dips sa-antarkumbhaka while chanting the Aghamarshana sukta while under the water.

4\. Japa and Upasthana

5\. 17 Tarpanas to specific Deva, Rshi and Pitru ganas.

  

When the Mahabharata mentions that Arjuna performed snana 3 times a day, all points from 1 to 5 are implicit in the subtext.

You will agree this process of snana is very different from pouring 3 mugs on one's head and applying Hamam soap... ;-)

  

Now that you know the process of snana, how will you "customise" this for a system based on Narada Pancharatra? In such a situation it is better to follow one's own text books from A to Z since they have been established by Adhikaris and the people who follow Gaudiya sampradaya have a natural shraddha towards the same.

  

The other reason for my objection to sourcing/customising from other sampradayas is that there is an internal continuity between different rituals within one's own sampradaya. This is lost when one tries to adapt from outside.

  

Think well about this.

  

Trying to know theory is ok but when your intention is to apply practically, you also have to consider whether what you are trying to introduce into your village is consistent with theory and practice of Narada Pancharatra, since that is the best way you can to honour your line of Gurus.

  

Kind Regards,

  

Venkat
