If there is a dosha in the aaSraya of the anna - the vessel, the cook, the sponsor, the server, someone who sees food (evil eye) and thoughts of all these - the consumer of such anna is also afflicted by that dosha. So if a vessel used or cook or server is unclean, or if someone is not very keen to cook or serve food, or arrange for the food to be prepared etc., instead of consuming such food, it is better to be hungry. Such seems to be the thinking.

  

While above is the practice, the theoretical framework is more nuanced. On the one hand, one is exhorted not to condemn food (अन्नं न निन्द्यात्। तद्व्रतम्।) or not to refrain from partaking of what is served (अन्नं न परिचक्षीत। तद्व्रतम्।); on the other hand, the one who offers food is told that one reaps as one sows: if offered in the best way, one gets the best result; a middling offer begets a middling result etc. (एतद्वै मुखतोऽन्नं राद्धम्। मुखतोऽस्मा अन्नं राध्यते। ...) meaning that one should offer the best food in the best possible way. (All these Srutis are from the Bhriguvalli of Taittiriyopanishat). A generalized exhortation is that one should offer anything with diligence: श्रद्धया देयमश्रद्धयाऽदेयम्। (शिक्षावल्ली).

  

So, by following a strict vrata ("Sorry sir, I eat food cooked only by my a member of my family or by my students or by me"), one avoids aaSraya-doshas while not running foul of Vedic injunctions.

  

Best regards
