One thought that comes to my mind is: both brahmacharins and sannyasins are 'pakkvaannasvaaminah', that is, they receive cooked food and they, since not having agni, cannot engage in cooking for themselves, strictly. So, the bhiksha a brahmacharin gets must be cooked food only. This is my guess, going by that maxim. I have only heard this wordbefore but not seen in any text actually.
