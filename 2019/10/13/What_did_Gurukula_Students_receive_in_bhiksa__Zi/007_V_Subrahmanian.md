I would also like to say that the 'bhikshaa' act could also be of the form of the recipientbeingfed in thatvery spot by the householder. This happens in case of Sannyasins too where they come to that house, have the feet washed, and served food there. Of course there is the other popular practice that I have myself witnessed in Mathur, the famed Sanskrit village near Shivamogga in Karnataka, where the sannyasin takes bhiksha from some houses and goes to a river bank and then partakes of the food there. I think with brahmacharis too this is possible that a householder offers to feed them at his house itself. I know of a practice in Bangalore where the students of a Pathashala were asked to go to a particular house everyday and have food there.
