Sriman Damodara Dasa ji

  

Pranam.

  

The meaning of the particular verse of Parasara Smriti can be fixed in case the full context (the particular adhikarana in full) can be shared.

  

Even without the full context we can reason as follows: When a grihastha seeks alms, we need to keep in mind that he has an establishment back home to support. If he has to carry food back home, he cannot carry cooked food (SishTas do not eat cooked food that has been carried over a public way, or in fact even seen by others).

  

With this background, we see that a grihastha without family in the same village becomes an atithi; one with family in the same village will not be eligible for pakvaanna. On the other hand, since a Brahmachari and Yati do not have an establishment to support they become pakvaannasvaaminau, while also being eligible for dravyam.

  

etena sarvam sama\~njasam.

  

Regards

N Siva Senani
