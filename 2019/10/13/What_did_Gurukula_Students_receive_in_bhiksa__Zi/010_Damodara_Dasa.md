Hare Krishna.  
  
Vidvan Sivasenani  
==================  

In sum, the following options are practical and do not fun foul of Sastra:  
- Grihasthas may offer money or ingredients to students, who then  
deposit the same with their teacher  
- Grihasthas may offer full meals for specified students  

======================  
  
This is a very interesting observation here by you, from parasara  
smrti. This sloka does come under the section of feeding the guests  
and thus it may be appropriate to interprete that cooked food here  
refers to feeding them by sitting them as guests. This is also very  
widely seen in Indian tradition, Sannyasins and Brahmacarins are  
invited for afternoon meals. It is also said in smrtis that  
brahmacaris should eat very controlled but in case of being invited  
for sraddha etc. ceremonies he can eat opulently.  
  
Vidvan Sivasenani  
==================  

It is heard in stories about Murari kavi etc. about the Gurupatni  
cooking for students. This fits in with it.  

==================  
  
It will be very helpful for me if you can provide some links to these  
stories. This is a nice new information I have come across for first  
time.  

  
Thankyou,  
Hari Guru Vaisnava das,  
damodara das
