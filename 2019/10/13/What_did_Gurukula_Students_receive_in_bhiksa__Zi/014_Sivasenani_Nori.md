**देवीं वाचमुपासते हि बहवः सारं सारस्वतं**

**जानीते नितरामसौ गुरुकुलक्लिष्टो मुरारिः कविः ।**

**अब्धिर्लङ्घित एव वानरभटैः किन्त्वस्य गम्भीरताम्**

**आपातालनिमग्नपीवरतनुर्जानाति मन्थाचलः ॥**

  

Above is a famous verse by Murari Kavi, the author of Anargharaghava. In the above the adjective गुरुकुलक्लिष्टः has a story behind it. Apparently the gurupatni of Murari used to offer very bad food to Murari but he was so focussed on studies that he never noticed it. The day Murari noticed it and passed a remark, his Guru is supposed to have said "You have never noticed this all these years, such was your focus. That you have noticed now means that your time in Gurukula is up. You may go now".

  

This is an oblique reference to difficult conditions in Gurukula (food, sleep, and treatment).

  

There is also this saying:

  

सुखार्थिनः कुतो विद्या नास्ति विद्यार्थिनः सुखम्।

सुखार्थी वा त्यजेद्विद्यां विद्यार्थी वा त्यजेत्सुखम्॥
