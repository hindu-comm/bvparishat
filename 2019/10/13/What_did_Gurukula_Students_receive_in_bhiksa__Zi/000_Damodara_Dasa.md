Hare Krishna.

  

Respected Vidvaj-janas,

  

I am in search of authoritative answers in this matter, based on sruti, smriti and tradition. My questions may seem impractical or irrelevant for present times. But for our village they are relevant because we are moving towards old culture and it has become possible for us to implement this.

  

In researching on different aspects of traditional gurukulas in order to plan future for our gurukula, we were discussing on the practice of bhiksa by students. There is a lot given in smrti sastras.

  

However, one thing is not clear in the references:

What type of foodstuffs students used to receive in bhiksa -- a part of cooked meals or just uncooked raw materials?

  

As far as I know, if a student takes bhiksa from any of the dvijas they can accept cooked meal also. However, if there is no dvija available to receive bhiksa from, then student should accept only uncooked raw materials.

  

If students receive cooked meals then what about the guru? Will guru's family also be getting their livelihood from part of that? After all student is supposed to surrender his bhiksa to the guru and then guru will give it back to him as needed.

  

But if the guru receives cooked meals from students' bhiksa, then what about his garhapatya fire? I.e. is it not compulsory for a grihastha dvija to cook in afternoon and offer in yajna? And then feed the hungry?

  

Also, if students receive uncooked raw materials in bhiksa, then who will Cook it, students or guru patni? Will there be elaborate arrangement for cooking which does take up a lot of time from studies?

  

Summarizing questions:

  

1\. Students used to receive cooked or uncooked food in bhiksa?

  

2\. If cooked food received, then did guru's family also shared from that? If yes then what about guru's everyday yajna where cooked food need to be offered?

  

3\. If uncooked good received, then who cooked it, guru patni?

  

Thankyou,

Hari Guru Vaisnava das,

Damodara das
