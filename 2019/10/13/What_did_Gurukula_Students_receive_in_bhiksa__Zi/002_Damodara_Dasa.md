Hare Krishna.  
  
Respected Venkat ji,  
  
Thankyou for your advice. I will ponder over it.  
  
Just for your information, our village has families who are strictly  
following rules and regulations, are inditiated, and do not eat  
anything that is not offered to Krishna and thus prasadam. Thus, now  
as our village has become a little big, it is possible for some our  
gurukula boys to start taking bhiksa from there. Also for future, many  
of these boys are going to be part of our village by marrying and thus  
setting family tradition. Thus, in future, it will become more  
possible to set the standards without compromising.  
  
Thus, we are planning. For planning we should know first what was  
actually in place; that sets our reference. Consideration of time  
place and circumstance comes when trying to apply these teachings in  
practice; and that is surely done. However, if we think that time  
place and circumstance are so bad that we should stop thinking or  
knowing about what was correct, then this is a fallible logic. Then  
why we have this Vidvat parishat at all; we do discuss on what was  
correct according to vedi standards.  
  
So I assume that you are not against my trying to know what is correct  
and was going on previously, but are just reminding me that I should  
also consider time place and circumstance.  

  
Thankyou,  
Hari Guru Vaisnava das,  

damodara das
