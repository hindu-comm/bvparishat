Dear Shri Damodara ji

  

  

". Then why we have this Vidvat parishat at all; we do discuss on what was

correct according to vedi standards."

  

You have hit the nail right on the head here.

  

The point is very simple. What a Gaudiya considers "Vedic" is very different from what a smArtha or even an agnihotri Sri Vaishnava considers "Vedic"

  

Ignoring the semantics behind the word "Vedic" will lead to confusion.

  

I am not asking you to not source opinions from the wide audience of Vidvans here.

I am merely pointing out that it will not be applicable to your case since you belong to the Narada Pancharatra system.

Traditional Gurukulas maintained the tretaagni and had their own rituals while the Gaudiyas have their own rituals.

Sourcing the practices of other sects may not get you far since biksha was traditionally done by wandering through villages and there were rules on how long one could wait at a house, not visiting the same house again next day and so on.

Your village will have to be substantially large for this not to be a pain for the grihiNis of your village.

  

My opposition to "bhiksha" is founded basically on the need to encourage Brahmacharis to take responsibility. I have seen plenty of prasadam being wasted especially by Brahmacharis resident in various Iskcons.

This laissez-faire attitude is compounded when one is not directly involved in the cooking of prasadam.

  

I am really curious now is it given anywhere in the rulebooks of your sampradaya that Brahmacharis have to maintain themselves through Bhiksha only? if so, how is "bhiksha" defined?

I would suggest you explore a "first principles" approach in terms of exploring why bhiksha was suggested to the first ashrama.

That should clarify your way forward.

  

Kind Regards,

  

Venkat
