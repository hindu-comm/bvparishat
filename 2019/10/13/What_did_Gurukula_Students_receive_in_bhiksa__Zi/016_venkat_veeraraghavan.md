Dear Shri Damodara Ji,

  

Yes. I understand that not everything is given, since at the time and date these sutras were recorded the things we now discuss were considered well known in fact too well known to merit mention.

  

This is where it is more profitable to find out what side branches of Gaudiya sects have done. They may even have some pramana to support their practice. Have you tried exploring and seeking help from other branches in Vrindavana, Mathura and Mayapur?

  

Bhiksha is a dicey subject these days because in kaliyuga most of the prana comes from food and the karma of the person who gives Bhiksha also affects the mind of the person receiving. It is very essential these days to be careful where and whom one accepts food/prasadam from.

While bhiksha serves to take away ahamkara/false ego from Brahmacharis....the other aspect is that what is received without self-effort is not appreciated.

There are many many stories of celibates accepting bhiksha, but the exact modalities of how they accepted bhiksha, how the bhiksha received was purified etc is not mentioned. This bhiksha was in the form of both raw and cooked food. The Pandavas themselves when they were hiding after the lakshagriha episode dressed as snatakas and accepted bhiksha from the village.

It is also mentioned in the Draupadi Satyabhama samvada in MB that Yudhisthira was maintaining many brahmacharis in his palace. This implies they were fed on premises and that they did not go around from house to house.

In line with the above, look into whether you can centralise Bhiksha so that you can also get seva from the Brahmacharis in preparing prasadam. Also this will not put undue burden on the other households. I assume most of the current people in the village are city dwellers who have quit their cushy jobs to lead a Vedic lifestyle. If this is the case it is better to give them some settling time without adding additional burdens like feeding the Brahmacharis. Usually people are enthusiastic in the beginning but when reality bites and they find themselves illequipped to deal with problems they tend to fall back on their previous life. That is basic human nature.

  

Kind Regards,

  

Venkat
