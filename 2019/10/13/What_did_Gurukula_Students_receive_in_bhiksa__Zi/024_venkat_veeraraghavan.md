Dear Shri Sivasenani ji

  

Thanks for the info!

  

I was under the impression that the bhoga in temples is covered for ritualistic reasons. I did not know that there is a shastric requirement that this be the case for all.

  

Also thanks for informing about Kumbhidhaanya. That is news to me.

  

What is Aasraya dosha?

  

Kind Regards,

  

Venkat
