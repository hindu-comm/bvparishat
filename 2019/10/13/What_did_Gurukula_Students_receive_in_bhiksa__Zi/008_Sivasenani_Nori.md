I am unable to offer a pramaana, but here are my thoughts

  

Brahmacharins living with a Guru who is a grihastha need to hand over all their Bhiksha collections to the Guru

  

So, it is appropriate that student Brahmacharins be offered uncooked food like rice, or better still, money so that they may deposit the collections with the Guru.

  

It is heard in stories about Murari kavi etc. about the Gurupatni cooking for students. This fits in with it.

  

If cooked food is to be offered to either Brahmacharins or Yatis, it should be properly offered by seating them at home and serving food as it is served to a guest. One variation that I am aware is that students used to have 'weekly' arrangements - as in on Monday, a student goes to Grihastha1 for lunch and dinner, on Tuesday to G2 and so on. A similar arrangement could also be thought of.

  

In sum, the followingoptions are practical and do not fun foul of Sastra:

- Grihasthas may offer money or ingredients to students, who then deposit the same with their teacher

- Grihasthas may offer full meals for specified students

N. Siva Senani
