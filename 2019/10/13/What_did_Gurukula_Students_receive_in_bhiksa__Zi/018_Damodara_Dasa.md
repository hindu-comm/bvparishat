Hare Krishna.  
  
One example that comes to mind is that of Durvasa Muni. He was doing  
vicarana with his 10,000 disciples and getting cooked meals  
everywhere, please correct me if I am wrong.  
  
Of course, it may be questioned or discussed if all his disciples were  
small kids in gurukula or grown up youth who are still brahmacaris. I  
have this question for a few years now.  

  
Thankyou,  
Hari Guru Vaisnava das,  
damodara das
