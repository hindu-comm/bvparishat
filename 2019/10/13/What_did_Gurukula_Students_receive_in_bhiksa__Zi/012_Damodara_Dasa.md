Hare Krishna.

  

Respected Venkat ji,

Pranams.

  

I would like to bring your attention to a few points that you might be in wrong understanding of ISKCON and Gaudiya tradition due to which you are not able to understand why I am trying to dig deep in to the non-pancaratrika tradition.

  

======================

1\. The idea of ISKCON which you have is based on what you have seen and experienced in different ISKCON temples in India and abroad. However, if you are to understand ISKCON's teachings you need to deeply study the instructions of ISKCON's founder Acharya His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada. He was a stauch representative of Vedic Culture (not just pancaratrika culture, which is something coined by those who do not understand the status of pancaratra in social guidance). However, to revive the whole vedic culture and its essence in the fast age running towards adharma and hell, he had to start from very basic medicine (that will start bringing sattva-guna) and then institute the details. Thus he started with the Sankirtana movement and had full plans to re-establish varnasrama dharma.

  

If you see his teachings, you will find that more than 50% of it speaks about varnasrama and re-establishing it worldwide, starting from ISKCON. When talking about social issues and how one should live in daily life, he doesn't bring pancaratric texts but often cite from Manu Samhita and other such texts. For instance, in speaking about gender roles he would repeatedly cite Manu samhita and explain in length how that is actually beneficial for current society. (See end of the email for quotations)

  

Thus, your idea about ISKCON is limited to your observation; however, more is to come. Because current ISKCON is not the one that Srila Prabhupada has envisioned for future, it is just one phase in the development towards final society, your derivation about ISKCON is incomplete. Moreover, ISKCON is a big society and you will not find the same thing everywhere. I would like to invite you to our village, stay here for a few days,experience another facet of Srila Prabhupada's mission, and discuss with us.

  

2\. ISKCON and Gaudiya Vaisnavas follow pancharatras; that is absoutely correct. But there is a misconception that pancharatras can fully replace Sruti and smrti traditions in all its aspects. That is not possible. I would like to ask one question to make it easier to understand. Say there is a society that is running based on pancharatra scriptures alone. What will be different punishments that king would inflict on the subjects when they committ some crime? Will there be someone like king or not? If king is not there then which type of government - democratic, communistic, etc. will it have? There are many such questions that pancharatras do not guide one at all. Similar is the case with Parasara Smrti. In the beginning itself it says that in Kaliyuga Parasara Smrti is the smrti to be followed. However, it doesn't guide in majority of the practical points, i.e. it is not a comprehensive guide to run a society or nation. However, if you take Manu Samhita and Yajnavalkya samhita, they are the most comprehensive guidance that are available with commentaries making them understandable from sruti smrti context.

  

**So what does it mean to say that in Kaliyuga Parasara Smrti is to be followed and vaisnavas should follow pancaratras?**

  

It means that there are some specific differences in some rules that result from different adhikara, faith and situation that are mentioned specifically in these granthas and they are to be followed by the follower of that particular grantha (not giving precedence to Manu and Yajnavalkya's guidance for those particular cases). For instance, the prayascittas to be performed for some sins are mentioned differently by Parasara; so in kaliyuga, for those particular sins prayascitta is to be suggested (by brahmana) from Parasara and not from Manu. Similarly for many sins there are prayascittas mentioned in pancaratras (that don't involve independent demigod worship); so the vaishnavas who follow pancaratras are to perform those prayascittas and not those given in Manu etc. for same sins.

But there are many many (vast majority) of fields for which neither Parasara nor pancaratras give any guidance.

  

Thus, if one wants to form and guide a society then one must resort to Manu etc. scriptures otherwise one will just be dependent on one's mental speculation (pratyaksa and anumana only) or someone's else's speculation. That will not be sastra vidhi and will certainly result in ultimate failure (Bg 16.23-24).

  

===============

  

There is a lot to discuss and ponder over in order to make sastric guidance practical and I have learned in the process how to understand situation of different sastras.

  

Hope this helps to increase understanding of all of us. I am writing emails in this spirit and not in spirit of challenging one sect or other, or even not having faith in own sampradaya. Truth remains truth, sampradayas may change. So, let us go by the spirit that sharing knowledge increases it.

  

I find this parishat as very informative and have got much help in our mission of trying to gradually revive some aspects of varnasrama.

  

Thankyou,

Hari Guru Vaisnava das,
