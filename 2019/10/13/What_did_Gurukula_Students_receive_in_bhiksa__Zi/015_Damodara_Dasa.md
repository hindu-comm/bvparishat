Respected Venkat ji,

  

Yes, following acara of one's own sampradaya is what we all understand as sampradaya maryada. That is certainly must be followed maxim. For instance regarding snana itself there are somewhat different procedures for different sects, stemming from different sections of sruti or smrtis. So follower of a particular sect has to follow his particular sakha in this regard.

  

I completely agree with the point that whatever is there in our own sampradaya should not be transgressed; we cannot follow its procedure from another sampradaya or branch.

  

However an important point to be noted is that for many things there will be no specific separate procedures set by one's own sampradaya or a particular scripture one is following. My point was that for such things one has to resort to the root sources and follow accordingly, in accordance with -- anuktam anyato grahyam & paroktam avirodhi ca.

  

Thus, in case of living as brahmacari in gurukula and what are its practices, no exhaustive treatment is given either by Hari Bhakti Vilasa or by pancaratras. Hari Bhakti Vilasa brings some points from scriptures like Manu samhita etc. and almost echoes similar rules not detailing them. This means that for detailed rules needed for practical application one has to resort to the sources which Hari Bhakti Vilasa is referring to, and these sources obviously refer to a particular tradition in which these things were followed.

  

Moreover, in Hari Bhakti Vilasa and other pancaratra granthas themselves many details are told to be sorted from somewhere else and not provided there. Pancaratras repeatedly say that an initiated person should go on strictly following his own varnasrama duties according to one's position (sva-dharma) and not neglect them. For instance, in Bharadvaja samhita it is said at the end of 1st chapter, "sadhanatvAbhimatyA ca nija-dharmasya varjanam" or giving up one's varnasrama duty considering it to be a different sadhana than bhakti. This is mentioned as one of the things that destroys bhakti and thus one's aim to ultimately reach vaikuntha.

  

So pancaratra themselves mention that one should follow varnasrama duties but hardly they mention details of those duties but expects that we are intelligent enough to source them from the scriptures and tradition where they are detailed. Even following A to Z of pancaratras will not be able to guide us in the matter of following our varnasrama duty. For instance I am a ksatriya king; what has pancaratra to say about governing my kingdom? If I am a vaisya, what is pancaratra's instruction about farming ettiquettes or cow protection? If I am a Brahmana part of a Sabha in a village, what does pancaratra teach me about nyaya and mimamsa rules to come to conclusion of some contradictory statements of sastras (of even pancaratras themselves)?

  

Thankyou,  

Hari Guru Vaisnava das,

damodara das
