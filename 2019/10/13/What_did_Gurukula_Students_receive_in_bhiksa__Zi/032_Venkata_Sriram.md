True Venkat ji...While reading Ramayana, I get goosebumps when I contemplate on the karmAnuSTAna of Ramachandra and how Valmiki visualised in kAvya.

  

During snAna-kAla also, there are tarpaNAs. The water that trickles down from shikhA / jaTa is used as tarpaNa ; also the udaka that is extracted

by pressing the wet clothes that were worn during snAna is offered as tarpaNa to pitrus (आर्द्र वस्त्र निपीडनं).

  

These are alsoसदाचाराः that were followed by Bhagavan Ramachandra and henceरामो विग्रहवान् धर्मः....

  

Thank you Venkat ji for reminding me my beloved lord .....

  

rgs,

sriram
