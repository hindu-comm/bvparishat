Durvasa Rshi and his disciples are likely all to have been mature in almost every sense of the word.  

I sincerely find it hard to believe the irascible Rshi would take a bunch of neophytes for disciple.

  

Some things may not be explicit and we have to infer.

  

Also Ravana taking the form of a wandering ascetic to ask Bhiksha of Sita

  

But both the above come under "prarivrajakas"

Also Draupadi and Sita were under atitheya dharma at that point of time --the duty to entertain with food and refreshment an unannouncedguest.
