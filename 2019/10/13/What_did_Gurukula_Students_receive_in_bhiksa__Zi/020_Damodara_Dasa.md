Hare Krishna.

  

Respected Sivasenani ji,

  

Your explanations are giving joy to me and making my understanding deeper. Idea that those whose family is there in village cannot be guest alone is new information for me although knowing to some extent, it didn't strike me. Later I would like to know more details about these logical and traditional rules.
