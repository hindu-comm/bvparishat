Dear Veeraraghavan garu

  

The avoidance of consumption of food seen by others is seen even today. If you see in temples, the entire garbha griha is covered up while offering naivedyam. The logic is that there can be aaSraya-dosha.

  

Regarding modes available to a brahmin grihastha, unchavritti is not the only one allowed. Yaayavaaram is also allowed, I believe. I am sure that we can find supporting evidence easily in Dharmasastra works (I am not in a position to look these up now) and can supply the same in a couple of days if you are unable to locate them. For instance the kumbhidhaanyas would simply keep a pot outside their home and villagers would come and keep their offerings in that pot (Mahabhashyam mentions that a SishTa is a kumbhidhaanya amongst others such as being a master of all Sastras more or less and being without anger).

  

Generallyspeaking, while a Brahmin grihastha is allowed to go begging (Brahmacharins of all three varnas can beg) apart from exceptions for the weak, destitute etc., grihasthas of other varnas are ordained other modes of jeevika. Again, will need time to come up with references.

  

One instance that readily comes to mind is the instance of Pandavas in Ekachakrapura, though they were Brahmacharins at that time. Another is the story of the Brahmin in Satyanarayana Vrata kathaa who goes begging and performs the vratam using the dravya he collected.

  

Regards

Senani
