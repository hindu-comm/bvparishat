> Dear Shri Damodara Dasa,

  

Hare Krishna.

  

There used to live a staunch Sri Vaishnava in my erstwhile house as tenant. Although he was manager of a bank, he wore dhotis to work and had his wife cook on wood fired stove. One of the main reasons he chose to live at my house as tenant was that it had a well and he would insist on not using taps under the presumption that Shri Ramanujacharya did not.

There is an issue of time-place here that is lost on many.

  

I am trying to explore a little commonsense here. Kindly do not take the following otherwise.

  

1\. While I appreciate your desire and nostalgia for "old times"..I myself not being much different, one has to make a distinction between what is essential and what is peripheral.

  

2\. You follow the Narada Pancharatra which completely negates and moves in the opposite direction (in terms of minimalism) to the tretagni system where Garhapatya, Ahavaniya and Dakshinagni were maintained. Even the cooking fire was sourced from the Garhapatya.

So what indeed is the practical relevance for your village project when you are not going to be maintaining the three fires?

How will it benefit you to know how even the Sandeepani Gurukula where Shri Krishna was a student studied with Sudhama?

Yours is a totally different paradigm with different rules.

  

3. Even if old students accepted cooked food as bhiksha, would any Brahmachari living dare to accept cooked food from a neighbouring household in modern times?

You must be very brave indeed to do so even from the household of a so called "brahmin".

I'll give you a small story that happened recently at my house...my aunt (mther's sister) died some time back and another sister who lived in Bangalore wanted to use our house as base in order to attend the funeral. This was around the time of pitru-paksha and Navratri.

This 85 year old lady spent 30 minutes on trying to convince my mother on why she could cook despite mrita-sutaka of 3 days which is observed by not entering sacred spaces especially the kitchen.

  

This is the standard of "achara" to be found in even "brahmin" households.

My 2 cents to you preserve whatever purity of achara you can by cutting off interactions with the neighbourhood. Bhiksha is not an option unless you have a farm near some family of agnihotris.

  

4\. Bhiksha was a way of life with celibates who did not own the land required to maintain themselves.

I assume this is not the case with your village project. So why beg, when one can live by one's own sweat and bAhubala?

  

5\. Due to points 1-4 concentrate on customising the Gurukula to what you need today rather than some utopian ideal in the distant past. That is the only way to ensure that your project thrives.



All the best!

  

Venkat
