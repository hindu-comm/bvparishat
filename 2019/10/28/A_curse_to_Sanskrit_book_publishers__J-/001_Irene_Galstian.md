Let us be restrained when criticising others. Sure, it's true that it's hard to work out what's available from publishers and what isn't. But if someone didn't print the book at some point, from what would anyone obtain scans? I suggest that before we criticise what isn't there, we first appreciate what is there: at least with some effort we can still obtain most books. Interest for Sanskrit is on the rise, with time publishers will find reliable ways to communicate, and the situation with obtaining printed books will become better. Scanning was and is useful irrespective of availability of printed books because an electronic text can be used in ways a printed book cannot.
