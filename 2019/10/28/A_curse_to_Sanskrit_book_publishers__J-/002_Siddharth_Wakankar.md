Dr. Irene,

  

You are absolutely right.

  

We must be hopeful for the better future,though,we suffered a lot when we could not get copies of prescribed books, some fifty years back.

  

I remember to have met and wrote a request letter to the then Vice Chancellor of the Bombay University,Justice P. B.Gajendragadkar,the retired Chief Justice if the Supreme Court of India and the younger brother of our great Sanskrit scholar and editor of Sanskrit texts,viz.A.B.Gajendragadkar.

  

It was in 1967 when I was studying for my M. A. He did assure to help the students by looking into that matter. It was a different thing that nothing good happened then for the interest of the students.

  

The same situation continues,to some less extent,even now,but,we have other sources to access books.So,be positive and patient.

  

Thanks and regards.  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
