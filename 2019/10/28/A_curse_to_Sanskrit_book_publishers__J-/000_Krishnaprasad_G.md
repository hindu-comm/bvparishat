Dear all

  

Due to timeconstraints, I could not reply to many mails regarding the requests for books.

  

There are so many books still available unsold for 100 years are being requested here for PDFs. (Including me) there is lack of information about the availability of the books with publishers.

  

Even I sometimes reply with confidence believing that, by looking at the date, the book might notbe available in the market and waste my time with energy to scan them from the libraries.

  

Recently I was reading about Niranunasika Champu Prabandha which is easily available in the market with cheaper prices than scanning etc. Reprinted by Rastriya Sanskrit Sansthan in 1998 edited by N P Unni.

  

I wasted lot of money or time to procure scan copy of many books. After I received the same I used to note the address from in print and order a copy from the publishers.what an irony of my life.

  

These things never end. And the publishers are ever cursed.
