Do you mean to says you could obtain copies of lakhs of out of print books, First editions of all Sanskrit related books and journals as reprints. Not even a fraction of whats printed is reprinted. Popular ones are that what you see most of the time online.  

You are talking about a few isolated incidents of which you are able to obtain reprints and trying to to draw conclusions. Digitizing or scanning of books is not a substitute to buying books a highly misconceived thought that exists. Is the publisher ever cursed or access to quality to well stocked libraries in India the main issue is what one can think off.
