"As for lakhs of out of print books etc, let's be clear what problem we're trying to make progress on. If it's the existential question of how to preserve books against time, it's an endless subject "

  

A Visionary once said. Let us assume there are 3 Lakhs books including Journal magazines Brochures which are ever printed pertaining to all aspects of India studies. Lets further amuse each material 300 pages. The number of pages would come to 300 lakhs. Lets us have a cost of Rs 2.00 per page The amount comes to 12 crores This money can be made easily available to Indian researchers and the government easily does have this money.

Simultaneously the catalogue gets prepared and metal data is captured. If done in a systematic way a comprehensive catalogue becomes available.

Millions of digital surrogates can be created and the utilization of such material to research gives countless possibilities

The same can be replicated for manuscripts.

Access to original scanned materials can always be restricted and done in such a way that its all within the frame work of law and fair usage exemption.

  

When I was talking about well stocked libraries I had public libraries of India in mind not university, specialized or private libraries.
