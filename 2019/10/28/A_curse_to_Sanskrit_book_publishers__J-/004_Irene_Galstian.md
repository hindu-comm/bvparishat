"Is the publisher ever cursed or access to quality to well stocked libraries in India the main issue is what one can think off."

  

That seems to me a relevant question.

And no, it's not just isolated incidents because I've asked our Interlibrary Loan librarian and her colleague at Oxford about their success rates. Both these people sat there for the past 25-30 years obtaining books for their respective universities (30,000+ people in both cases). I also have similar information from several other large universities in the UK and the US.

As for lakhs of out of print books etc, let's be clear what problem we're trying to make progress on. If it's the existential question of how to preserve books against time, it's an endless subject.

But if we ask a simpler question - why is it that books are much harder to obtain in India than in Western countries - it's mostly a matter of global catalogs, websites like Bookfinder, and better accountability in the sense that more people actually do the jobs they're paid to do. So to make progress on obtaining books, at least for now, the way forward is to network with people who have access to books and who have reasonably good follow-through. And also to find helpful and competent librarians, ask them to explain how their university/institute acquires books, and via them try to network with agencies like DK and with publishers directly.
