Very Nice verse.  
  
  
I have जिज्ञासा in this verse.  
आवलिः -isn't it a masculine gender word. I remember आवली is used in feminine.  
  
I have also doubt about, लघु अक्षर should be used first when there is equal number of letters. According to that, would that be सुखशान्तिं instead of शान्तिसुखे । I am not convinced with the applicability of अभ्यर्हितपूर्वं here.  
  
Thanks
