Welcome announcement!

Deserves wide publicity.

  

Please try to attract the best talents so that there is a good end-product

which should be well-designed and authentic,  

and could be as comprehensive as possible,

and as user-friendly as possible.

  

Think of needs and uses over a decade or two ahead.

  

I wish the project all success from the bottom of my heart!

This is a project that can be a remedial measure for जीर्णमङ्गे सुभाषितम् ।

  

The signs of our times could very well then be:  

प्रोत्साहिनश्च बोद्धारः

 प्रभवो ज्ञान-रागिणः ।

बोध-यत्न-पराश्चान्ये

 वर्धतेऽङ्ग ! सुभाषितम् ॥
