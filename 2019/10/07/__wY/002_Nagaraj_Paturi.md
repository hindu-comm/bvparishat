I searched for Modern Sanskrit Writings in KARNATAKA authored by Shri S. Ranganath and published by RASHTRIYA SANSKRIT SANSKRIT SANSTHAN

  

and found it at

  

<http://www.sanskrit.nic.in/DigitalBook/M/Mswk.pdf>  

  

I was looking for such books as part of the Modern Creative Life of Sanskrit project

  

to counter

  

The Death of Sanskrit thesis by Prof. Sheldon Pollock.
