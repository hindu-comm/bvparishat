Respected Members

                 Presently I am working on the life and works of Pandit T.Subbaraya Shastri..Except for Vimana Shastra the others works are not known. To his disciplesand friends he had knowledge of all the sciences in this world. As early as 1892 he was discussing and giving notes on a text by name Soudamini Kala Sutras a book dealing with physics and basic sciences to his disciplesand friends. Unfortunately there is no trace of these notes .Panditji worked as Lecturer on Hindu Subjects with the Government of Mysore .

  

      The work Modern Sanskrit Writings in KARNATAKA authored by
Shri S. Ranganath and published by RASHTRIYA SANSKRIT SANSKRIT SANSTHAN in 2009 mentions that the Late Gotur Venkatachala Sarma wrote a biography of Subbaraya Shastri of Anekal in English. I request scholars to let me know to where the manuscript of this biography could be traced.

  

         Thanking in advance
