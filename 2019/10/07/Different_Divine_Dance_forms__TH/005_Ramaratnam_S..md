Ancient Tamil literature mentions three types of *koothu*. One is *Āriyakoothu* and the second one is *Santhi Koothu* and the third one is *Sakkai Koothu.* In the Vanji kandam of Silappatikaram there is a mention of a koothu called *Kotticcedam* by a male dancer called Paravur Kootaccakkaian.

We have an ancient Tamil inscription referring to *Ariyakkoothu* exclusively performed by men.

Dr. Padma Subrahmanyam refers to a certain male dancer called Kumaran Srikantan who performed the *Ariya Koothu.* The inscription is in the temple of Tiruvavaduthurai belonging to the 9th regnal year of Raja Raja I. It mentions that an endowment of land was created and called as ‘nritya bhoga’ to Kumaran Srikantan, and this was given for his performance of Ariya Koothu in six parts/sections.

We have reference to another dancer performing *Ariyakkoothu,* that is, Kirttimaraikkadan alias Tiruvelai-araichchakkai. The Tamil inscription is present in the Mahalingaswami temple in Tiruvidaimarudur on the north wall of the central shrine. It is dated to the 4th regnal year of Parakesarivarman (Aditya II Karikala son of Sundara Chola Parantaka II).

Dr. Padma Subrahmanyam further describes how this *Ariyakkoothu* was is part of the *Pancha Marabu*, by the author Arivanar and hence the name *Ariyakkoothu.* He describes the seven varieties of *Koothu* (*Tandava, Nritta, Natya, Kuravai vari, Kolam,* and *Vagai*) in his book as being based on Bharata’s Nāṭyaśāstra.

There was another kind of dance performed called *Santhikkoothu.* This was performed by both genders. Silappatikaram has detailed descriptions of *Santhikkoothu*. In the Somanatha temple, Attur, Tiruchchendur Taluk in Tirunelveli district, the Tamil inscription is located on a pillar in the south veranda of the first *prakaram.* It is dated to the 16th regnal year of Jatavarman Srivallabha. The male dancer called Soman performed *Santhikkoothu*. The third type of dance performed by both genders was *Sakkai koothu* or *Chakkai koothu*. *Cakkai koothu* is still being performed as *Chakkiar Koothu* or Koodiyattam by the males of the Chakkiar community in Kerala.

A certain Sakkai Marayan Vikrama solan or Chozhan is mentioned as having performed *Sakkai koothu* in the Kamarasavalli/Kamaravalli temple. The Tamil inscription says that he was rewarded for performing the dance thrice on the Tiruvadirai nakshatram day in Marghazhi and Vaigasi. The birth star of Rajendra Chola I.

In another Tamil inscription in the temple of Varamuleswara temple, Kilappaluvur, Udaiyarpalayam Taluk, Tiruchirapalli district the *sakkai koothu* is mentioned. But, it does not mention the name of the dancer.
