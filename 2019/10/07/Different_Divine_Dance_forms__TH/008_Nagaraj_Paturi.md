Sri Subbu-ji,

  

In the Natyas'aastra tradition of Sanskrit works,

  

Nrittaratnavali by Jayappasenani (13th century AD)

  

deals with a huge list of such forms.

  

Forms are classified into Marga and Desi.

  

This book has a big list of Desi forms.

  

Natya Shaastra provides basics of ideas such as taanDava vs laasyya etc. But does not provide lists of forms, particularly of ekaahaaryaka =solo dance variety.
