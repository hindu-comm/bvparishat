Dr. Irene,

  

You are right, But now,these editions are out of stock with O.I.also, because,I wanted one in early 1990s,but,could not get.

  

I still remember that I gave one copy of that edition to Prof Dr.V.M.Kulkarni in late 1990s as he was editing the remaining three volumes of NS. after Dr.K.Krishnamurthy edited the first [vol.in](http://vol.in) early 1990s on the basis of a new ms.found from Nepal.

  

Now,it has become a history.

  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
