 Dramaturgical texts also speak of another set of 10 ‘ lāsyas’ that are suited to a drama or a dance drama. They are :

i. ‘Geya pada’ which is the presentation of a sublime song sung in a seated posture with the accompaniment of a stringed instrument like ‘vīṇā’. We have an example in the ‘gaurī gṛha’ scene of the play Nāgānanda.

ii. ‘Sthita pāṭhya’ is the performance of abhinaya to a love song in a fixed posture, sitting or standing. The love letter scene of Abhijñāana Ṥākuntala may be cited as an example.

iii. ‘Āsīna’ is that situation where a lady is found musing quietly in a pensive mood.

iv. ‘Puṣpagandhikā’ is a scene in which both men and women dance merrily. An illustration for this can be found in the play Ratnāvalī.

v. ‘Pracchedaka’ is a song sequence where the infidelity of the lover is set out in a suggestive manner by the heroine. The ‘haṁsapadikā’ scene of Abhijñāana Ṥākuntala is an example.

vi. ‘Trigūḍha’ is a dance by men in the disguise of women. An example for this can cited from Malatī Mādhava, where Mādhava appears in the disguise of Mālatī.

vii. ‘Saindhavaka’ is a ‘ lāsya’ in the course of which characters dance in a manner suited to their own folk traditions and sing in the local dialect.

viii. ‘Dvimūḍhaka’ is a dance in a circular pace.

ix. ‘Uttamottamaka’ is a type of dance which is accompanied by varied songs and is full of sportive movements and joyous feelings.

x. ‘Ukta – pratyukta’ is a competitive dance where the movements of one dancer is countered by another. In the episode of Gaṅgā – Gaurī, there is scope for this dance.
