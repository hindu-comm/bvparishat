Many thanks to all of you who have responded with such a magnificent fund of information on the dance types of the Tamil region. I would like to know if there are equivalent names/forms of dance detailed in the Natya Shaastra of Bharata or any other ancient text. A friend, finding the copious Tamil names was curious about the Sanskrit counterpart of this literature.

  

warm regards
