Suprabhat.

  

The photos of 108 Karanas from the Chidambaram Temple were published in the First Critical Edition of the Natyashastra of Bharata brought out by our Oriental Institute,Baroda.

  

In the later editions, however,these pictures were omitted, for reasons not known to me.

  

The First Critical Edition,thus,is a Collector's Item and very few of us have it with us now.
