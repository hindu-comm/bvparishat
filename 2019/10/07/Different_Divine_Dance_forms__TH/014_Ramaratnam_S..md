**The Uparūpakas**

Sanskrit Drmaturgical texts speak of not only the *daśarūpakas*, the ten types of major play forms but also the minor classifications called the *uparūpakas.* While the ten major forms are dialogue oriented, the *uparūpakas* are dance oriented. Some of them which are a mixture of both might be called the earliest dance drama forms. A brief account of the Uparūpakas will be helpful in assessing their relation to dance drama.

**i. Ṥrīgadita:**

Ṥrīgadita depicts love in separation. The heroine describes the qualities of the lover to her friend (gadita = telling) and pines for him. If he has offended her or deceived her, she may find fault with him and long for reunion. The theme is depicted through songs and dance. The Tamil Kuravanci is comparable to this Uparūpaka. In Kuravanci also the heroine pines for her lover, the deity of the local temple or the local king and lets her feelings out to her friend. But in the Kuravanci there will be an additional character, namely, a gypsy woman, a fortune teller who is introduced to the heroine. She identifies her lover and foretells happy reunion. This kind of a theme is found in the varṇam, padam and jāvali items of the South Indian dance.

**ii. Durmilikā**

The theme is clandestine love affair. The narrator is the *cetī* or the female go-between of the heroine who tells the audience about the secret love between the lovers. She plans for their union for a favour or a fee. Sometimes she may blackmail either of them or both to achieve her own ends. She sings and dances in between.



**iii. Prasthāna**

This Uparūpaka depicts the *prasthāna* or going away of the lover on travel. After their first meeting, the hero and the heroine have fallen in love with each other; as is usual, there had been a misunderstanding and love quarrel between them. But at the time of departure both find the separation hard to bear. The agony of separation increases at the onset of spring or winter. Description of seasons also takes place through songs and dances. According to theory there should be an element of *vīra rasa* at the end. Probably the hero may kill the enemies and comes back victorious to take the hand of his beloved.

**iv. Kāvya or Citrakāvya**

There is only a small difference between the two. The ‘kāvya’ is sung in one *raga,* while the ‘citrakāvya’ is sung in a variety of *ragas.* The songs and the corresponding dances delineate the erotic sentiment. The Gītagovinda of Jayadeva may be cited as an illustration of this type. It may be noted that even today dance dramas on Gītagovinda are presented quite often by the artistes.

**v. Bhāṇa or Bhāṇikā**

The composition of a Bhāṇikā may be called as a *nṛtyaprabandha*. The songs may be in praise of deities like Ṥiva, Rāma or Kṛṣṇa. The singer may also narrate a few episodes in the middle. The dance will consist of energetic jumps and leaps to indicate the emotions. The instruments played in soft or strong mode and the choice of tune will aid the depiction of the sentiments. According to Abhinavabharatī, Bhāṇikā is didactic in nature. The actors will take the role of certain animals and depict the stories. Stories from Pañcatanta or Hitopadeśa may perhaps be depicted. The message of the stories may be conveyed in a contrived way by the employment of figures of speech like Dṛṣṭānta and Anyāpadeśa.

**vi. Goṣṭhī**

Goṣṭhī is probably derived from ‘goṣṭha’, meaning ‘hamlet of the cowherds’. According to some of the dramaturgical texts, ‘goṣṭhī’ represents the sports of young Kṛṣṇa in the cowherd kingdom of Gokula, on the banks of the river Yamunā. Kṛṣṇa’s childhood exploits like ‘kāliya nartana’ and the lifting of ‘govardhana’ mountain may form the theme. It is full of songs and dances.****

**vii. Hallīsaka**

Hallīsaka is a dance form wherein one person dances in the middle while others form a circle around him and dance. It is ideally suited for depicting Gopi dance. It is identical with the Garbha dance of Gujarat, Kummi and Kudicchappattu of Tamil nadu and Kaikottikali of Kerala. The beat is kept by the dancers clapping their hands.

**viii. Nartanaka**

This dance is similar to the Nautch. A danseuse sings and renders through gestures, the content of the song. The varieties of this dance form are – Śamyā, Lāsya, Chalika and Dvipadī. Chalika is mentioned in Mālavikāgnimitra. It is probably derived from the word ‘chala’ meaning deception or covering up. A damsel conveys to the audience her love under the pretext of performing abhinaya for some composition. According to Viṣṇupurāṇa, the songs in Nartanaka may be rendered in different dialects and the dancers will wear manifold local costumes. Śamyā is similar to the ‘kol attam’ of Tamil Nadu. The dancers keep the beat with small sticks. ‘Dvipadī’ is high speed dancing for ‘laya’ oriented songs.

**ix. Rāsaka**

Rāsaka is similar to Hallīsaka; the difference is that in the latter there will be only one male dancer dancing in the middle but in the former there will be many male dancers. According another opinion, Rāsaka is a dance consisting of only female dancers. They group and regroup to form different geometrical patterns while dancing.

 It is clear from the description of the Uparūpakas that some of them are suitable for independent dance drama format while the rest may form part of it.
