The notice I am reproducing below in a shortened form appeared on the Indology forum/list a few hours ago. Some of you may wish to note it as an additional source of documents. It is possible that it concentrates only on studies, surveys, reports, etc. and on primary Sanskrit, Prakrit, etc. texts, but it is still likely to be very useful to those members of this forum (e.g., Prof. Madhav M. Deshpand, Prof. N. Paturi) whose research has a broad sweep. We will learn what the reality is after October 18 when the link provided below is promised to be active.

**Subject:****Launch of South Asia Open Archives (SAOA)**

**Date:**October 6, 2019

  

Dear Colleagues,

…

  

South Asia Open Archives (SAOA) is a rich and growing curated collection of key research materials from and about the region of South Asia, with historical and contemporary sources covering a variety of subjects in English and other South Asian languages. SAOA preserves, digitizes and makes its content freely accessible to the world on the web. It is the product of a collaborative initiative of a broad consortium of research libraries (in South Asia and around the world) and their respective South Asian Studies librarians. It is enriched by substantial contributions of content, human and material resources from a community of libraries, research centers, archives and other institutions partnering to bring these resources out for global scholarship and pedagogy. Administratively hosted by the Center for Research Libraries (CRL), and presented online for open access in partnership with JSTOR/Ithaka, SAOA aims to serve as a critical node in open access scholarship.
