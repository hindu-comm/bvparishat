Dear Colleagues,

  

  As I have been reading the Lipiśālāsandarśana-Parivarta \[p. 89, P. L. Vaidya edition\], some interesting features of the alphabet popped up for me. The Alphabet omits *r̥* and *l̥*, but includes *ai, au*, and *aḥ*. Among the consonants, it adds *kṣ* at the end after *h*. The version of this passage as given in the Bauddhāgamārthasaṅgraha \[ed by P. L. Vaidya\] also omits *l*, while it is included in the version of Lalitavistara edited by Vaidya himself. I wonder if there are textual variants about this. I don't know what this alphabet represents. The omission of *r̥* and *l̥* goes along the phonologies of Prakrits, but the inclusion of*ai, au*, and *aḥ*goes in the direction of Sanskrit. The addition of *kṣ* and the possible omission of *l* point to something else that I cannot figure out. Any suggestions and references are welcome.
