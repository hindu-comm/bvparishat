Dear Madhav ji,  
  
I have not come across the normal sanskrit ordering of the akṣaras (a ā i ī ...) being used for or by any BCE (or early CE) prākṛtic text. Have you?  
  
In my mind, this ordering is typicalof standard-Sanskrit (i.e. Pāṇinian sanskrit) and its standardizedphonemic inventory (the omission of r̥ and l̥ notwithstanding) -- and would probably not have beenconceived of in a prākṛtic milieu.  
  
Not only ai, au & aḥ, but also śa, ṣa, sa ha is typical of standard-sanskrit.  
  
The omission of r̥ & l̥ therefore is probably accidental (or perhaps the lipi had not evolved far enough to have a separate symbol for r̥ & l̥ by the time the lalitavistara was being written). I do not believe the lalitavistara is historically accurate in naming tens of lipis, there simply is no evidence to show that there were any more than two or three in common use until about the 3rd century CE.  

  
Regards,  
Ramakrishnan
