Dear friends,

  

I am studying the Indian Science during the British period in India.
The British succeeded

in closing down all indigenous institutions and created a new education system based on  

literature and languages.  The analytic quality of the Indian mind was forced to be cleaned

out in favor of acceptance and conformity. It took about fifty years or so when people

in Calcutta realized that the youth was being misused. Some tried to create new indigenous

institutions which eventually flourished through private funds. The first of this group was

Indian association of Cultivation of Science in Calcutta in 1876 which eventually became the  

work place for C V Raman. The next was Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore established

by the Tata family in 1909. Being discriminated in his own work Jagadish Chandra Bose

established an institution using his own resources in 1917. J C Bose had already shown the

similarity of plants and animals in physiology and was trying to create a new India.

The following is a small excerpt from his lecture "The Voice of Life" in the institute's

inauguration.

  

*It was held that by its very peculiar constitution, the Indian mind would always turn away from the study of Nature to metaphysical speculations. Even had the capacity for inquiry and accurate observation being assumed present, there were no opportunities for their employment, there were no well-equipped laboratories, nor skilled mechanics. This was all too true. It is for man not to quarrel with circumstances but bravely accept them; and we belong to that race and dynasty who*

*had accomplished great things with simple means.

There are many other nationalist visionaries who dreamed of a strong free and new analytic

India. Please share any quotes you may have in local literature or local efforts. Fundraising

was definitely hard and the Government rarely listened!
