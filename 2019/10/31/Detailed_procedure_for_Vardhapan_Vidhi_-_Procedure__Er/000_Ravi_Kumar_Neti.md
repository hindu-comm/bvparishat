Respected Group members -

  

I am looking for a detailed procedure of 'Vardhapan Vidhi', also called as 'Varsha Vridhi Karma' mentioned in 'Dharma Sindhu'.

  

I am looking for any detailed book/mantras to perform this procedure.

At a high-level it is mentioned that - We need to do the following :

  

1\. Ganapathi Puja

2\. Puja for Kula Devatha, Prajapathi, Surya, and Janma Nakshatra  

3\. Puja for Astha Chiranjeevis

4\. Puja for Shashti Devi

  

It is not clear if each of these pujas to be performed with Ashothara Sathanamavali for each of them.

Also, some texts prescribe to perform homa for 16 devathas - But above list mentions only 16 devathas.

  

If someone know the procedure, and has a detailed steps to perform this, please help.

  

Regards

Ravi
