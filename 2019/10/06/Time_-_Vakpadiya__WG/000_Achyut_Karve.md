Dear Vidwans,

  

Here is a translation of Section 3 - Time Sloka 8 of the Vakpadiya. It reads,

  

" 8. Division in its associates are though of as its own divisions.
Being thus differentiated, Time leads to divisions in conventional measurements."

  

The above sloka would remind one of Einsteins Theory of Relativity where he considers time as a dimension.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
