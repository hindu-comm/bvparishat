Namaste,

According to praacheena naiyaayikaas shakti is in jaati aakruti and vyakti. But naveena naiyaayikaas agree that shakti is not in aakruti.. It is mentioned in kaarikaavalee and other granthas.

Kindly help me out to know about these naveena naiyaayikaas ( who they are, they belong to which place, which period)...

Thanks and regards,

Sangeeta
