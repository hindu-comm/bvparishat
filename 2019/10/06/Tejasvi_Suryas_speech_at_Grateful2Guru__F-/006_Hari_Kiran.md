Pranaams Ajit Garu,

  

I don't know about the rules of this group nor did I post it, but given it is an Indic Academy event, I leave the following thoughts for your kind consideration.

  

I request you to look at the speech as only an effect. The cause is our #grateful2guru program where we are venerating 108 academics, activists, artists and authors all over India. We started this in 2016 and in 2018 we linked it to Gurupurnima. Till last year we honoured 15 scholars and during the year we called for nominations and receivedmore than 200. From these we selected108 and announced the list on Gurupurnima. (<http://www.indictoday.com/category/announcements/>) (<http://www.indictoday.com/announcements/grateful-to-gurus-2019/> )

  

Subsequently we honoured in Delhi, Chennai, Hyderabad on 5th we honoured 15 Gurus in Bangalore.

  

Young Tejaswi was invited as the Chief Guest.He did the pada puja of all the Gurus, ( We are doing this in all our functions) did a shasthanga pranaam on the stage and gave an extraordinary speech that highlighted the importance of Gurus in our tradition. His speech was laced with devotion.It was an experience that was a unique combination of intellectual, cultural and spiritual.

  

Yes he is a politician. But this speech is about not about politics but respecting Gurushishya parampara. Please do listen at your convenience.

  

Do follow us [www.indicacademy.org](http://www.indicacademy.org) and [www.indictoday.com](http://www.indictoday.com).

  

Regards

  

Hari
