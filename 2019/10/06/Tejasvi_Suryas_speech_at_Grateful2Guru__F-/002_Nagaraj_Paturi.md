If political leaders are found to have respect for Sanskrit scholars and in their participation in such events speak revealing their informedness about Sanskritic tradition, that too when this happens from a young political leaders , Sanskrit scholars, tradition-loving scholars celebrate such a situation.

  

If Tejasvi was speaking in an auto dealers' meet on some tax reduction decision and it was shared in this list it would have been a misfit here.

  

But the present post is not unsuitable here at all.
