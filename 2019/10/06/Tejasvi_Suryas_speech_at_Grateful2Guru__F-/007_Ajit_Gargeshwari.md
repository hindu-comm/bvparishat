I have immense admiration of the excellent work being done by the Indic Academy. Thanks to the enlightened trustees and the director for have created such a wonderful platform. Sanskrit and India studies at large need such grand and well thought out initiatives.. Now the context is clear to me. Had I know the context earlier maybe I would not have posted.  

Yet I stick to my view the more we keep research and academics away from politics the better the academics thrives. Academics should always be independent of politics is my stand. Nothing in the speech did talk politics. I know the speaker spontaneously spoke as tribute to the great Guru Shisya Parmapara but highlighting speeches of politicians serves no purpose on a scholarly mailing list it only puts academics in shackles. Politicians should be eloquent speakers and should have knowledge on issues faced in various domain including education and its good to see young politicians have such knowledge. I wish the speeches of the Gurus honoured are posted that would be attribute to them and music to ears for listeners.

As I said earlier I join you in paying tributes to our acharyas and the acharya parampara. Guru Vachana Sada Vijiyate.
