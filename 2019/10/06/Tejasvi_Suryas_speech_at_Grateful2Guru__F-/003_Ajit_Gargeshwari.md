Political leaders have respect for Sanskrit scholars there is no doubt absolutely. Call any politician to any academic event pertaining to Sanskrit he or she will give a good speech and will praise Sanskrit scholars and traditions Will they ridicule Sanskrit or scholars when they are called to talk on any event connected with Sanskrit.

  

I don't wish to say anything further just mentioned what I felt about posting or public speeches of all politicians.
