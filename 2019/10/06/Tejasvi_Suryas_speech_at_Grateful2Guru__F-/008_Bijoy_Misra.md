I agree with you. It will be a great step if we maintain India's open architecture than bind ourselves in cults and religions.

India produced the science of the arts. Let the goal be to extend it and look further than create engineering.

Let Indic Academy continue to champion original research in the intricacy of the arts., we call humanities.  

A view from distance.
