Pranaams to all,

  

I am happy to announce the third "Weekend with Wisdom", this time with Meenakshi Jain ji,

  

5 slots are available. Please do share and or apply.

  

Not to be missed opportunity to learn from a bold and diligent scholar.

The feedback received from the participants for the first two retreats with Shrikant Talageri and Subhash Kak has been overwhelming. Participants benefited immensely from their interactions in a off site setting.

  

  

  

Hari
