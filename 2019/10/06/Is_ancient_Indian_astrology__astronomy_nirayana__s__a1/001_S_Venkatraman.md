Pranams Kaulji,

  

Your mails on the subject are deeply disturbing to me a Vedic Astrologer who has had good success in his predictions using nirayana zodiac. But your mail shook my confidence in that system from its very roots. Just a few questions for you sir:

  

1\. Mr Ramakrishna Bhat who has translated Varamihira’s Brihat Samhita, has also written a book on Vedic Astrology where he follows Nirayana zodiac. How could he do so?

  

2\. The Nirayana Panchangs that we follow has/ had the approval of very learned men like the Shankaracharyas. In particular it had the approval of the Sage of Kanchi Jagadguru Shri Chandrashekarendra Saraswati the 68th Pontiff of Kanchi Mutt also known as the ‘Walking God’. How could he/ others have all got it so wrong?

  

To say the least, I am baffled.

  

Regards,

Venkat.
