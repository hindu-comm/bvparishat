Dear Prof. Wakankar,

Jai Shri Ram!

Thanks for your response.

\< You are absolutely right when you say that intuition plays a big role, besides your knowledge, saadhanaa or tapascharyaa and the Grace of God. We are just like instruments to convey our opinion and viewpoint to the needy for alleviating his tortures or troubles.>

I fully agree with what you have said!

In the Mahabharata, we find that Arjuna was defeated by a few petty robbers while he was escorting the women folk of Yadu-Vamsha to Dwarka after the departure of Bhagwan Krishna for His "Goloka".

Arjuna realized that in spite of his bow, quiver and arrows being the same i.e. the famous *Gandiva* and he being as valorous as he was when he had vanquished Bhishma and Karna etc. during the war he could not win over a few petty robbers because his friend, philosopher and guide viz. Krishna was not with him this time!

Similarly, howsoever correct the calculations even up to the *shashtyamsha* and what not, the efficacy of predictions is directly related to the fact whether the friend, philosopher and guide viz. Bhagwan Krishna is with the astrologer or not!

At the same time, very often I wonder whether we must barter our *tapasya* and *sadhana* for peeping into somebody's future!

***Even otherwise also, His ways are really mysterious.***

In the Valmiki Ramayana, 2/3/6 when Dasharatha approached Vasishtha Rishi, the son of Brahmaji, for making preparations for anointing Bhagwan Ram as the crown-prince, Vasishtha Muni advised the concerned ministers to make preparations for the same as the very next day, a very auspicious *muhurta*had been selected by king Dasharatha for that purpose. So full fledged preparations were made to get Bhagwan Ram anointed but as we know, instead of Bhagwan Ram being anointed, Dasharatha himself died a miserable death and Bhagwan Ram was exiled!

Obviously, either Vasishtha Rishi did not have the faintest idea as to what was going to happen i.e. that by taking such a step, Dasharatha was going to die a depressed and miserable man, or Vasishtha Muni did not inform the king deliberately about the consequences of such a step.  
Obviously, it is the latter i.e. Vasishtha Muni did not inform Dasharatha about the consequences of such a decision since he did not want to interfere with the divine dispensation.

Thus we are always in a dilemma and therefore before telling the truth to our clients, if at all we know the same, we should think twice.

***Does astrology misguide us sometimes?***

Furthermore, king Dasharatha has said in 2/44/18

अवष्टब्धं च मे राम नक्षत्रं दारुणैग्रहैः\| आवेदयन्ति दैवज्ञाः सूर्याङ्गारकराहुभिः।।

प्रायेण च निमित्तनामीदृशानां समुद्भवे \| राजा हि मृत्युमाप्नोति घोरां चापदमृच्छति ।।

"Astrologers declare that the asterism under which I was born is under the influence of unpropitious planets, viz. the Sun, Mars and Rahu. On the appearance of such evil portents a monarch surely suffers a terrible calamity and ultimately meets his end". (Gita Press translation).

A couple of things are clear here. There is no mention of *Dasha-Bhukti* but the influence of malefics on the birth nakshatra.
This type of astrology was prevailing before the advent of Mesha, Vrisha etc. Rashis into India. Astrological works like Atharva-Veda Parishishta talk of such portents.

The second point is that if astrologers had not warned king Dasharatha about such dangers, maybe Dasharatha would not have acted in a hurry for declaring Bhagwan Ram as the crown prince and maybe such a tragic end of the king himself could have been avoided, at least postponed!

***The divine will is supreme!***

Then again the billion dollar question is that neither the astrologers of the king Dasharatha----if they existed then at all!---nor Vasishtha Muni himself, so much so that Bhagwan Ram, the divine Incarnation of Bhagwan Vishnu, could neither save his father Dashratha from such an end, nor could He avoid His own exile, nor the travails of Bhagwati Sita, which she was going to face in the forests!

It maybe argued that it is all His "*leela"*, ----play--- and He was destined to play such a role. But then the same Bhagwan Vishnu, as an Incarnation as Bhagwan Krishna has said in the Gita 16/61

ईश्वरः सर्व भूतानां हृद्देशेअर्जुन तिष्ठति । भ्रामयन् सर्व भूतानि यन्त्रारूढानि मायया।।

"Arjuna, God abides in the heart of all creatures, causing them to revolve according to their Karma by His illusive power (Maya) as though mounted on a machine". (Gita Press translation).

Goswami Tulsidas has repeated the same thing in his immortal work, *Shri Rama Charitamanasa*:

 उमा दारु जोषित की नाईं । सब हि नचावत राम गोसाईं ।।

"O Uma, Rama the 'puppet master' is making the entire humanity dance like wooden puppets"

***Does predictive astrology really help us?***

In view of the above clarifications, maybe that is why Manu the law giver has cautioned about predictive astrologers being*nakshatra soochis.*

And Swami Dayanand Saraswati called predictive astrologers as 'Popejis" and *Janma Patirkia* as "*Shoka-Patrika"* शोक पत्रिका!

The tail piece is that for such a doubtful and dubious venture as predictive astrology, that too the *niraadhaar niraayana* one, we are killing our own dharma by our own hands by celebrating all our muhurtas and festivals on wrong days!

Is that what the "Vedic astrology" teaches us? No! certainly not!

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!

A K Kaul
