\*Uttarayana historically moved from Kumbha Sankranti (dhanishtha) to Makara Sankranti. This means Rashi-s are fixed and \*Uttarayana moves, no?

P.S. I've put \* on (\*Uttarayana) by which I mean winter-solstice, to differentiate it from (Uttarayana) the original meaning of which is not known. This discussion is however irrelevant here.
