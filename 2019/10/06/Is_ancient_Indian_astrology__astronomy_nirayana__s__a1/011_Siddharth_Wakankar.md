Dear Dr.Kaul ji,

  

Thanks for your detailed explanation.

  

Some 45 years back,I had shown the horoscope of my father to one of the best astrologers in Mumbai to know when my father will be discharged from the hospital. He saw it 3/4 times and did not say a word and said all is ok.

  

Next day,my father breathed his last and I met the astrologer after a couple of days and questioned him about that.He gave me a valid reason saying that the Shastra does not allow an astrologer to predict the death,even if he knows it,because,some person might have a Vaachaasiddhi and he is not supposed to interfere with the Will of the God.That was his very traditional and orthodox view and I had to accept it.

  

Kind regards.

  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
