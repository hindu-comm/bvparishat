Dear Sri Krishnan, I am delighted to read your post. Please let me know if the book by Ekamram is available online.

There are natural phenomena that are part and parcel of Ṛtam that happen not subject to human intervention. For example an eclipse whether predicted or not is not bound by definitions of astronomy/astrology. For religious purposes one may observe ekādaśī, dwādaśī as per some preconceived definitions, but Uttarāyāṇa-kāla and even that ‘day’ is beyond human conventions, as it is an aspect of Ṛtam that the Vedas extol. So, a paramahamsa experiencing the Universal rhythm directly has no need for the almanacs but will feel and reveal the Ṛtam as Satyam.

When Uttarayana day is knownfrom Vedic timesto be the longest night of the year, with sunrise at the southern most point on the horizon arguments otherwise are erroneous.

Regards

RN Iyengar
