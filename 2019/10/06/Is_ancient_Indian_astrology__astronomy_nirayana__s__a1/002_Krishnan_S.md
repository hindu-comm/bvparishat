Shri Venkat ji

  

With reference to your referenceto "Sage of Kanchi Jagadguru Shri Chandrashekarendra Saraswati the 68th Pontiff of Kanchi Mutt" in your mail, I wish to submit the following.

  

1\. One Sri. Ekamram was a close sishya of Sri Sage of Kanchi, who was fortunate to attend on the Sage during his yatra in Andhra, Karnataka & Maharashtra in late 1980's. He has writtena book in Tamil "Sri Mahaperiyavalum, Ekambram ahia naanum", (Attachement#1). In rough translation the title means " Sri Maha Periyava & self-Ekambram"

  

In that book in one page Sri. Ekamram mentions in Tamil "This day is 7th day of (Tamil Solar month) Marghazhi. That day is the Uttarayana Punya Kalam for Sri Acharya and hence for us all" (Attachment#2)

  

This 7th day of Tamil Solar Marghazhi month roughly corresponds to Dec 21/22.

  

So Can I assume that Sri Acharya celebrated Uttarayana as per Sayana system?????

  

2\. The Panchangam of Sri Kanchi Mutt is a Drik Nirayana Panchangam. Still i do find references to Sayana system.. For example against Mar 21/22, you can find mentioning of "Mesha Ayanam", against June 21/22 you can see "Kataka Ayanam". against Sept 23 you can find "Tula Ayanam; and against Dec 21/22 you can see "Makara Ayanam"

  

So can I assume that Sri Kanchi Mutt is has favorable consideration for Sayna system?????
