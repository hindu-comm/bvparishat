Dear Dr.Kaul ji,

  

You are absolutely right when you say that intuition plays a big role, besides your knowledge,saadhanaa or tapascharyaa and the Grace of the God. We are just like instruments to convey our opinion and viewpoint to the needy for alleviating his tortures or troubles.

  

Thanks and regards.  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
