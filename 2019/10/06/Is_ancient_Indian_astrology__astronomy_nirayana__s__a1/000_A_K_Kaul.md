Respected members of Bharatiya Vidvat Parishad,

Jai Shri Ram!

After *Panchasiddhantika,* we shall discuss *Brihat  
Samhita* also known as *Varahi Sanhita.*

The second shloka of 3rd Chapter viz. *Ravichara Adyaya* has said साम्प्रतमयनम् सवितुः कर्कटाद्यं मृगादितश्चान्यत् । उक्ताभावे विकृतिः प्रत्यक्ष परीक्षनैर्व्यक्तिः ।।

M Ramakrishna Bhat (MLBD edition), the well known astrologer and scholar, has translated it as

"At present the Southerly course of the sun *(Dakshinayana)* starts from the beginning of Cancer and the other *(Uttarayana)* from the beginning of Capricorn. The actual fact which goes against the old statement can be verified by direct observation". (Attachment RKBHAT-1)

Thus here also VM has confirmed, as in *Panchasiddhantika*, Uttarayana coinciding with Makara Samkranti and Dakshinayana with Karkata Samkranti. Since VM was around in 505 CE, if there had been any *nirayana* or if at least VM himself had followed some *nirayana,* he could never have clubbed Makar Samkranti with Uttarayana and Karkata Samkranti with Dakshinayana!

The following 4th and 5th verses from the same chapterare quite revealing and stunning!

अप्राप्य मकरमर्को विनिवृत्तो हन्ति सापरां याम्यां। कर्कटमसंप्रप्तो विनिवृत्तश्चोत्तरां सैन्द्रीं।।

"If the sun should change his course before reaching Makara he would cause the destruction of countries in the West and South. While should he alter his course before touching Cancer, he would harm the countries in the East and North". (Attachment RKBHAT-1)

In the next i.e. 6th shloka, VM has said

उत्तरमयनमतीत्य व्यावृत्तः क्षेमसस्य वृद्धि करः।

प्रकृतस्थश्चाप्येवं विकृतगतिर्भयकृदुष्णाँशुः ।।

Should the sun tarry a little longer in his northerly course and then retrace his steps towards the south, he would cause great happiness in the country as well as an abundant growth of crops. The same effect will follow from the natural movement of the sun. But if it is contrary to the rule, there will be danger to the world! (Attachment RKBHAT-2)

It is not only Ramakrishna Bhat who has translated these shlokas like that but Chidambaram Iyer and Subramanyam Swami, both well known astrologers and scholars of South India, also have given similar translations all of which are attached.

So it is absolutely clear that for VM, Makar Samkranti had to coincide with Uttarayana, and Karkata Samkranti with Dakshinayana! No
exceptions were tolerable.

Could it be that it was happening like that only around 505 AD but was not expected in later or earlier years because of precession?

***Samskrit commentaries on Brihat Samhita***

Though VM has said categorically that whenever the Solstices do not coincide with Karkata/Makara, the results would not be normal, yet let us see what the commentators of yore had to say about such phenomena:

In Shaka 888 i.e. 966 AD, Bhatotpala, the famous scholar from Kashmir, has said about these phenomena exactly the same thing that Messrs Iyer, Swami and Bhat have said

Quote

अर्क आदित्यो मकरमप्राप्य मकरमगत्वा यदि विनिवृत्तो व्यावृत्तस्तदा सापरां याम्यामपर्या पश्चिमया सह दक्षिणां दिशम् हन्ति। तत्स्थान् जनान्नाशयतीत्यर्थः। तथा कर्कटकं कुलीरमसम्प्राप्तो Sगतो यदि निवृत्तो भवति तदोत्तरामुदीचीं दिशं सैन्द्रीं सपूर्वाम् हन्ति \| तत्स्थान् जनान्नाशयतीत्यर्थः \|\|4\|\|

उष्नांशुरादित्य उत्तरमयनमतीत्यातिक्रम्य मकरं प्राप्य पश्चाद्यदि व्यावृत्तो निवर्तितस्तदा क्षेमसस्य वृद्धिकरो भवति \|लब्धपालनं क्षेमं करोति, लोके सस्यानां च वृद्धिकरो भवति\|...दक्षिनायणमप्येवम् ज्ञेयम् \|
तथा प्रकृतिस्थः स्वभावस्थाश्चाप्येवं क्षेमसस्यवृद्धिकृद्भवति \|\|5\|\|

Unquote

Thus we can safely conclude that even in tenth century AD, astrologers and astronomers like Bhatotpala expected and wanted Makar Samkranti to coincide exactly with Uttarayana and Karkata Samkranti with Dakshinayana!(Attachment BS-Bhatotpala)! No ifs and no buts!

***What about the later commentators?***

Bhaskar-Yogi, a scholar of 1150 Shaka i.e. 1228 CE, exactly 262 years after Bhatotpala has written a commentary on *Brihat Samhita*. It is known as Utpala-Parimala and is published by Rashtriya Samskrit Samsthan, New Delhi.

Commenting on the fourth shloka he has said

गणितायनकालात् पूर्वं दृष्टायनं चेत् प्रोक्त दिग्द्वन्द्वस्थदेशप्रजानाशः which means that if the actual Uttarayana or Dakshinayana take place before the Uttarayana or Dakshinayana as per the calculations, then the residents of the two directions viz. North and East get destroyed!

Bhaskar-Yogi has also said in the same breath, in his commentary on the fifth shloka क्रमादनयोःगणितादधिकत्वे तत्समत्वे च शुभमेव If the Uttarayana or Dakshinayana take place after the calculated Makar/Karkata Samkranti or if there is no difference between the calculated Samkrantis and the actual Ayanas (Solstices) then the results are quite beneficial! (Attachment Bhaskaryogi-BS).

Whether it is astrologers like M Ramakrishna Bhat or Chidambaram Iyer or Subramanyam Swami of the 20th century who have translated Brihat Samhita or whether it is Bhatotpala of 10th century or Bhaskar Yogi of 13th century, all have testified in one voice that Makar Samkranti must coincide with Uttarayana and Karka Samkranti with Dakshinayana as per Varahamihira and even the Surya Siddhanta!

***What is happening in India today?***

Now let us see what is happening these days!

The entire Hindu community the world over is celebrating Makar Samkranti over the last at least about a couple of centuries---thanks to Grhalaghava and Makaranda----and to ''almighty" Lahiri for the last about eighty years!-- anywhere between January 13 and 15 every year and Karkata Samkranti between July 13 and 15. On the other hand, Uttarayana the Winter Solstice always takes place on the shortest day of the year i.e. around December 21 or so and Dakshinayana (the Summer Solstice) when it is the longest day of the year viz. around June 20 or so!

Obviously, we are celebrating our festivals neither as per the Surya Siddhanta nor as advised by Varahamihira!

The difference between the Makar Samkranti and Uttarayana is about 24 days these days----Uttarayana "recedes" before 24 days of Makar Samkranti and Dakshinayana about 24 days earlier from Karkata Samkranti, whereas Varahamihira had predicted dire consequences for such phenomena if there was a difference of even a day or so!

And if we continue to follow the *niraadhaar niraayana* a day will come when Karat Samkranti will coincide with Uttarayana instead of Dakshinayana and Makar Samkranti with Dakshinayana instead of Uttarayana----all in the name of "Vedic astrology"!!!

Even the Gita has admonished in 16/23

यः शास्त्र विधिमुत्सृज्य वर्तते कामकारतः \| न स सिद्धिमवाप्नोति न सुखं न परां गतिम् \|\|

Discarding the injunctions of the scriptures, he who acts in an arbitrary way according to his sweet will, such a person neither attains occult powers, nor the supreme goal, nor even happiness. (Gita Press translation)!

***Tropicalists----Westerners!---are following Varahamihira and the Surya Siddhanta and even the Hindu shastras!***

On the other hand, if you take any Western country, the exact moment of sun's entrance into (tropical) Makar Samkranti is the moment of Uttarayana and Karkata Samkranti Dakshinayana and so on!

We must really think on all these aspects, before declaring nirayana astrology to be Vedic since it is not even as per Panchasiddhantika or Brihat Samhita nor as per the Surya Siddhanta, least of all any Shastra!

So *Nirayaana* is really *niraadhaar*!

We shall discuss this issue of Brihat Samhita vis-a-vis the SS further in next mail as to why we landed in such a mess i.e. दुविधा में दोनों गए माया मिल न राम! i.e. as to why we are following neither VM nor the SS nor the Vedas nor even the Puranas!

Till then, with regards and Jai Shri Ram!
