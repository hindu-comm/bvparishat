Dear Shri Venkatramanji,

Jai Shri Ram!

Thank you for your response! I have pondered on all your points thoroughlyand below are my views.

\< Your mails on the subject are deeply disturbing to me a Vedic Astrologer who has had good success in his predictions using nirayana zodiac.>

My maternal grandfather was an amateur astrologer of Kashmir in early 1950s. People would flock to him for predictions as most of them proved quite correct! He also suggested some remedial measures!

So far so good! But quite late in the day, I came to know that the horoscopes from which he made correct predictions were prepared from *Vijayeshwar Jantri* in *Sharda* script. It was calculated on the basis of *Makaranda-----*a handbook of the Surya Siddhanta-----the calculations of which were far from correct. This I came to know from its comparison with *Rashtriya Panchanga* in about 1960. I had such a blind faith in *Vijayeshwar Panchang* that I believed it to be more accurate than *Rashtriya Panchanga*, because my grandpa was using it and his predictions proved correct.

On top of it, the predictions made by my grandpa were not from *Vimshottari Dasha* but *Yogini Dasha* and that also without any *Bhukta-bhogya* corrections.

More often than naught, the timings of eclipses given in the *Vijayeshwar Panchanga* were plus/minus by several hours. And we were told that the actual timings did not tally with predicted results because of the sins of people!

Moral of the story: *Correct predictions are more a matter of "sixth sense" i.e. intuition and divine grace than anything else.*

Btw, initially, I was a *nirayana* buff myself for several decades following in the footsteps of my grandpa---and of course, the well known Dr. B V Raman!--- and how I switched over to *sayana* , is an interesting story! But about that some other time.

***"How much" Vedic is Vedic astrology?***

What however, disturbs me is that we are using the term "Vedic astrology" for predictive astrology that too the Rashi based one and that too the *niradhar nirayana* rashis!

I have literally gone through the entire Vedic lore available as on date. I am therefore repeating it for the umpteenth time that it is not only that there are no Mesha, Vrisha etc. Rashis, whether *sayana* or *nirayana*, in any of the Vedas or the Vedangas, but planets like Mangal, Shani etc. also are conspicuous by their absence from all the four Vedas and the *Vedanga Jyotisham.*

We find planets much later in the*Atharva Jyotisham*, a work of about 5th/6th century BCE.

Apart from that, I feel it an insult to the Vedic seers if we presume them to be dependent on Mangal, Shani and Rahu, Kethu or Sade-Sati etc. to peep into their future. No Vedic seer, including Maharshi Parashar, has advised us to go to some astrologer to decipher our fate!

On the other hand, we are advised---even admonished---that too by none other than Yamaraja Himself!---in Kathopanishad 1/14

उत्तिष्ठत जाग्रत प्राप्य वरान्निबोधत। क्षुरस्य धारा निशिता दुरत्यया दुर्गम् पदस्तत्कवयो वदन्ति।।

Even in the epics, there is hardly any mention of *Janma Patris*, because if any of the Puranas or epics had given the actual *Janma-patri* of even one of the Pandavas or Kauravas, not to speak of Bhagwan Krishna, we would not have been claiming the Mahabharata war to have taken place anywhere between 5561 BCE (Nilesh Oak) and 1500 BCE!

In the Gita 2/6 Arjuna had expressed his doubt नैतद्विद्मः कतरन्नो गरीयो, यद्वा जयेम यदि वा नो जयेयुः "We do not know......Whether we shall win or they will conquer us". Obviously Arjuna had not consulted any jyotishi including his grandfather Parashara Rishi of Brihat Parashara
fame because no jyotishis were around then.

Bhagwan Krishna also did not advise Arjuna to consult Parashari-- a DIY astrological manual---nor did He advise Arjuna to leave everything to fate.

On the other hand, He just split the beans in 2/37

हतो वा प्राप्स्यसि स्वर्गँ जित्वा वा भोक्षसे महीम्। तस्मादुत्तिष्ठ कौन्तेय युद्धाय कृत निश्चयः।।

"Die, and you will win heaven; conquer and you enjoy the sovereignty of the earth; therefore, stand up, Arjuna, determined to fight."

***Tropical Rashi chakra and astrology are better candidates for "Vedic" at least Pauranik astrology***.  

We know it fully by now that there are neither Mesha etc. Rashis nor Mangal Shani etc. planets in the Vedas or the Dangers Jyotisha. However, we find the Rashis a plenty in the Purana like Srimad Bhagvata, Vishnu Purana, Shiv Maha Purana, Vishnu Dharmottara Purana, Vamana Purana, Devi Purana and so on though not in the epics.

And as per the Brihadaranyakopanishad the epics and Purana are known as *Panchama* i.e. the fifth**Veda. So the tropical Rashis are a part and parcel of the *Panchama* Veda. *Naturally, tropical astronomy (and its offshoot of astrology) are the real (Panchama) Vedic astronomy (and its offshoot of astrology) and not the niradhar nirayana!*

***Tropical predictive astrology is equally as correct as *niraadhaar niraayana* astrology:***

Now that predictive astrology has become one of the "most favoured hobbies" or even professions, in spite of it being conspicuous by its absence from our scriptures, it is better to opt for that system which has some link---even a distant one through Tropical Mesha etc. Rashis---to our shastras and is not in conflict with them but in accordance with them!

In most of the European countries and in the USA etc., the majority of practitioners there practise tropical system coupled with Secondary Progressions and/or transits etc. Similarly, in India also quite a few astrologers practise Western system, just as quite a few practitioners opt for *niraayana* (even if it is *niraadhaar!*) in overseas countries! In India, Pandit Sudhakar Dwivedi and quite a few others used sayana rashichakkra with dasha-bhukti for predictive astrology\| (Attachment Sudhakar).

Thus, the results are at least at par with *niraadhaar niraayana* if not better than the same!

So to be on the safer side, and so that there is no conflict with scriptural festivals and muhurtas, one should opt for tropical system.

If somehow, because of one reason or another, a practitioner does not want to switch over to tropical system, he/she should at least segregate festivals and muhurtas from astrology so that there is no conflict.

\< 1. Mr Ramakrishna Bhat who has translated Varamihira’s Brihat Samhita, has also written a book on Vedic Astrology where he follows Nirayana zodiac. How could he do so? \>  

I have absolutely no idea!

There are similar anomalies about other astrologers and well read scholars also.

His Holiness Srila Bhakti Vedanta Prabhupada has translated Srimad Bhagvata from cover to cover. In his translation of 5/22/4-6 he has said

Quote

When the sun passes through Mesha (Aries) and Tula (Libra), the duration of day and night are equal. When it passes through five signs headed by Vrishabha, the duration of the days increases (until Cancer)....the duration of days decreases until Capricorn....(Attachment ISKCON BHAGVATA).

Unquote

Thus it is out and out a tropical Rashichakra. But ISKCON people are celebrating Shri Krishna Janmashtami etc. as per Lahiri Rashichakra and not the Rashi-chakra envisaged in Srimad Bhagvatam etc.. Why? Again, I have no idea!

Similarly, Dr. B V Raman, as per his footnote in the page with Bhagwan Krishna's horoscope in his "Notable Horoscopes", has collected the details about His birth particulars from Srimad Bhagvata, Vishnu Purana and Hari Vamsha Purana---all proclaiming the Rashi-chakra to be Tropical!

But in spite of the same, Dr Raman got the *nirayana* chart of Bhagwan Krishna prepared from Cyril Fagan with his own Ayanamsha known as Ramana Ayanamsha!

So it is very difficult for me to answer your questions as to why such reputed and scholarly persons opt for *niraayana* as against the natural and scriptural *sayana*!

\<The Nirayana Panchangs that we follow has/ had the approval of very learned men like the Shankaracharyas. In particular it had the approval of the Sage of Kanchi Jagadguru Shri Chandrashekarendra Saraswati the 68th Pontiff of Kanchi Mutt also known as the ‘Walking God’. How could he/ others have all got it so wrong?>

That is what baffles me equally especially since the present Jagadguru Shankaracharya of Kanchi Kamakoti has specifically advised to follow "Chitra Paksha" Rashichakra for festivals etc. अयनांशविषये प्रमाणिकीमेकाम् रीतिं निर्णेतं विचारं कृत्वा अतिबाहुल्येन चित्रापक्षमेवादतवन्तः (Attachment Kanchikamakoti Aadeshapatra)

\<To say the least, I am baffled. \>

The same is the case with me! I am equally perplexed as it appears that apart from a few selfless souls like the Tamilian Brahmin Shri T V Sivaraman, Shri Darshaneya Lokesh and a few friends of theirs besides some institutions, we are least bothered as to why we celebrate *Mahalaya/Sarva Pitra Amavasya* on the day of actual Dipavali or marriages during the real *Shradha-Paksha*or *Dhanur-masa/Kharamasa*and so on! 

Above all, for Kashmiri Pandits, *Maha Shivaratri* is one of the most sacred annual festivals the reparations for which start from *Magha* (Gauna-mana Phalguna) *Krishna Pratipat.* On the one hand we praised Acharya Abhinavgupta to skies and recited his "prayers" with zeal and zest, but now thanks to "almighty" Lahiri Rashichakra, we do not celebrate even that festival on correct days!

My anguish will be visible from the attachment "*Abhinavgupta-Mahashivaratri"*----a page from from my Ephemeris for 1999.

The Panchanga makers of Kashmir have yet to answer my queries as to why they have made Kashmiri Pandits *Buddhi Brasht* and made them lose their home and hearth by making them celebrate even *Maha Shivaratri* on wrong days !!

Need I say anything else?

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!
