Friends,

  

One my friends,Prof. Dr. Navalata from Kanpur,has published one Sanskrit-Hindi book, titled,  

संस्कृत साहित्ये कृषिविज्ञानम्. I think,it was published some 20/25 years ago, possibly,by Chowkhamba.

  

She has covered almost all the Sanskrit sources for compiling this wonderful and very informative book.

  

Everybody should read it and if possible, somebody should translate it into English, for wider consumption.

  

Best of luck in your efforts.  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
