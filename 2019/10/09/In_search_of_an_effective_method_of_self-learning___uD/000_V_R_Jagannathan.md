I submit humbly the fruit of decades of my sustained efforts and perseverance (*tapasya*) to all scholars of the Parishad with utmost respect on this auspicious day of Vijaya Dasami, It is a program called English Online on our site [www.linguanet.in](http://www.linguanet.in/). Go to *Online Courses/**English Online* to view the Demo.

I feel gratified on two counts while presenting the program. First, we have been successful in crafting an automated mechanism whereby one can develop an online learning program for any language with least efforts. In fact, we are already working on programs such as Hindi Online and Tamil Online. The program also allows the use of any medium language, so that the learner gets necessary inputs without much ado. The English Online course comes with four medium languages right now viz. Hindi, Tamil, Punjabi and Gujarati. The second significant aspect of the program is a methodological claim.. Proponents of modern language pedagogy have been against any effort at conscious teaching. On the contrary, I maintain that language can be learnt better through conscious and intense speech practice, through a well-developed and highly structured set of materials. I have found this approach to be quite successful in conducting language courses at various venues. Hence, I took courage to develop it as the most efficient way of learning a language â€“ online and through self-study. Those interested in the methodological discussion may see the relevant blogs in the website.

I request esteemed scholars to view the Demo and grace me with their comments and suggestions. Regards.
