Sri Jagannathan ji,

  

These types of programs are much needed.

  

Your pedagogical approach is quite interesting. Could you tell us more about it - particularly the conscious and intense speech practice that you refer to. How do you plan to direct it digitally? As an alternative to the digital approach, are you considering any physical contact classes for the speech practice specifically?

  

Furthermore, in my experience, instructional materials (be they digital or physical) seem to fall short in one respect or the other on the field. In what respects are your instructional materials practically better, could you give us an idea of your USP. (I have glanced through the blog posts. they discus theory mostly, but I am interested in practical effect first.)

  

Also, the demo link does not seem to be free - a credit card payment link is first coming up on screen. And an error message pops up for the pricing plans link. (<http://219.90.67.166:89/English.aspx>)

  

Pls continue the good work.  

  

  

kind regards

Harsha Wardhan
