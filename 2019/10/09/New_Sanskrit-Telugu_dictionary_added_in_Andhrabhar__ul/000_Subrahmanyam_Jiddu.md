This is to inform Sanskrit enthusiasts who understand Telugu (others kindly ignore) that Andhrabharati website has now added a new "Samskruta Andhra Nighantuvu" written by late Sri Mudhiganti Gopala Reddy garu.

<http://www.andhrabharati.com/dictionary/>

  

Very useful feature of this new dictionary is that for every Sanskrit word, not only its definition (nirvachanam) but also the derivation has been given (vyutpatti).

You may note that Andhrabharati website already includes "Samskruta Andhra Nighantuvu" published by Vavilla in 1943.

  

Hope you find it useful.

  

Thanks,

Subrahmanyam
