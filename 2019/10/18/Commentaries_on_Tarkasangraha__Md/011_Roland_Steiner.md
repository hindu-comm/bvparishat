\> Some young scholars should take up such a project to unearth such rare and  
\> almost unknown MSS.,by focusing on certain specific texts.  
  

Just released:  
  
The second volume of Bhāskarakaṇṭha's Mokṣopāya-Nirvāṇa-Ṭīkā edited by  
Bruno Lo Turco (Roma).  
  
"This volume completes the critical edition of the large extant  
fragment of the Nirvāṇaprakaraṇa — the sixth section of the Mokṣopāya  
— with the commentary Nirvāṇaṭīkā of Bhāskarakaṇṭha, one of the last  
great non-dualist Śaivite masters. The Mokṣopāya, a huge  
philosophico-soteriological work probably composed by a Kashmiri  
author in the tenth century of our era, was the original version of  
what would become the Yogavāsiṣṭha, which enjoyed enormous popularity  
in India, in certain regions second only to the two great epic poems."
