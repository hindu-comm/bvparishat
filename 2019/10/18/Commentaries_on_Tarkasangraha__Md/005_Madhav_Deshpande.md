Thinking about texts with high number of commentaries, two works that come to my mind are Nāgeśabhaṭṭa's Paribhāṣenduśekhara and Śabdenduśekhara. It looks like while Śabdenduśekhara was widely studied, the larger work Br̥hat-Śabdenduśekhara was not studied so widely. Similarly, while the Parama-Laghu-Mañjūṣāand the Laghumañjūṣā were studied more widely, the larger Br̥hat-Mañjūṣā was not studied so widely. These larger texts have only recently been published, while the shorter texts have undergone numerous editions, commentaries and reprints. For some reason, there are half dozen commentaries on Kaiyaṭa's Pradīpa \[now published from Pondichery\], but not so many on Nāgeśa's Uddyota \[except Vaidyanāṭha's Chāyā, extracts included in the Nirnaya Sagara edition of the Mahābhāṣya\]. I am wondering what all these differences point to. It would be nice to have some sort of a historical account of the curriculums of traditional Pāṭhaśālās for the last few centuries from various parts of India. That might throw some light on which texts were more widely studied and where. Do we have sources for such a historical account?
