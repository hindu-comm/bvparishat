Dear Friends,

  

There are many local libraries or centres of learning where rare manuscripts are preserved.

  

Some 25/30 years back,I saw one such com.on the Tarkasangraha in the Sarvajanik Vachanalay,Nashik. It is written by some scholar named Gadgil Shastri. This library, like the H.P.T.College,Nashik,contains many rare and unknown Sanskrit MSS.

  

Moreover,in the Libraries of the different Maharajas also,there is a treasure of old and rare MSS not much known outside that State. It is just possible that we may get some com.on the Tarkasangraha in those libraries.

  

Some young scholars should take up such a project to unearth such rare and almost unknown MSS.,by focusing on certain specific texts.
