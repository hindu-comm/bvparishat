Thank you so much, Ajit Ji, for this marvelous list of commentaries on the Tarkasaṃgraha. The other work that has a very large number of commentaries is Mammaṭa's Kāvyaprakāśa. The number of commentaries is a kind of measure of the popularity of a given work. For some reason, introductory works on Mīmāṃsā like the Mīmāṃsā-Paribhāṣā and Mīmāṃsā-Nyāya-Prakāśa don't have such a large number of commentaries.
Even the Vedānta-Paribhāṣā does not have such a large number of commentaries. Did more students study the Tarkasaṃgraha as compared to students studying these other works from allied branches? What has been the experience in the Pāṭhaśālās?
