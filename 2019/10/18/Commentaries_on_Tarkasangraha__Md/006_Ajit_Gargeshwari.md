A bibliography has to be created consulting NCC and books which have accurate an verifiable bibliography information. Once that is done in a comprehensive manner then further analytical studies including 'historical account of the curriculums of traditional Pāṭhaśālās for the last few centuries from various parts of India' Newer editions and more secondary studies is possible Request subject matter experts like you to contribute towards a comprehensive bibliography .  

  

PS It is just not enough to say a given text has a thousand commentaries. Those commentaries have to be listed. Published information should be documented and manuscripts where they exists information should be given accurately
