While the cakrabhramaNa example is used in Advaita Vedanta to denote the continuance of prarabdha karma for a Jnani, the 'dagdhapaTa' nyaya is also used to show that the continued prarabdha karma will not produce any binding effect for the Jnani just as a burnt cloth or burnt rope, though continuing to have a form is not capable of producing the effect of wiping, binding, etc. The effect of an earlier action that leaves samskara, also called vaasanaa, is sometimes given the analogy of 'garlic/onion placed in a bowl for some time, leaves the smell lasting in the bowl, even after the garlic/onion has been removed.
