Dear scholars,

  

I am finding a word very difficult to decipher in a manuscript. It is very smudged, deleted and corrected. The nearest I could reach was something like दग्धलशुनसदम्बरवासवत् . The context is that after true knowledge of difference between prakriti and purusha in Sankhya philosophy, the body continues because of samskaara.चक्रभ्रमवद्धृतशरीरः is the usual simily in Sankhya philosophy.

  

Is any member of the list aware about usage ofदग्धलशुन in such contexts?
