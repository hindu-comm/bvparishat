Devakiji,

  

In the website referred by you, you may find this specific 'thaniyan' in the following link.

<http://www.acharya.org/d.html>(select Diyaprabhandam, pothu thaniyangal).

  

Sri Parasara Bhattar has also written a 'thaniyan' for Thiruppavai. This may be seen in this link.

<http://www.acharya.org/d.html>(select Divyaprabandham, mudhalayiram,thiruppavai to get to the thaniyan).

  

Also see Divyaprabandham, Nangamayiram, thiruvaimozhi: there 2 thaniyans by Sri Bhattar written in Tamil.

  
The works of Sri Bhattar are partially archived in this website.<https://srivaishnavagranthams.wordpress.com/purvacharya-literature/>

More to come in future.

  

Adiyen Soundararajan
