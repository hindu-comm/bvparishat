Dear Soundararajan,

  

I thank you very much for your reply. You should be right that this verse should be a मुक्तकः type. Or, as you said, 'thaniyan' in Tamil. I am trying to locate source of the verse as it is said to have been composed by Parāśara Bhaṭṭa. If it is the case, can we find the verse in one of this works/collected works? I would be grateful if somebody could point out the source.

  

Sincerely,

Devaki
