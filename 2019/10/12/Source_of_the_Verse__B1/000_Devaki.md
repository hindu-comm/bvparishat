Esteemed scholars,

  

प्रणमामि \|

  

My question is about the source of the following verse:

  

भूतं सरश्च महदाह्वयभट्टनाथ-

श्रीभक्तिसारकुलशेखरयोगिवाहान् ।

भक्ताङ्घ्रिरेणुपरकालयतीन्द्रमिश्रान्

श्रीमत्पराङ्कुशमुनिं प्रणतोऽस्मि नित्यम् ॥

  

  

Tradition holds that this verse is composed by Parāśara Bhaṭṭa, son of Kureśa and the successor of Rāmānujācārya. I checked works of Parāśara Bhaṭṭa available to me (<http://www.acharya.org/sloka/bhattar/index.html>), but could not find the verse.

  

Certainly, the book called Nityānusandhānam mentions (I attach below) it as composed by Parāśara Bhṭṭa and scholars mention so too, but I could not find the exactly reference in the consulted sources. Could you please help me to find the source of the verse?

  

Sincerely,

Devaki Sapkota
