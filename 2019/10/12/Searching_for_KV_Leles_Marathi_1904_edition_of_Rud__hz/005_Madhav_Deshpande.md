Dear Irene,

  

  As it happens, I have a print copy of this book containing these two commentaries with Marathi translation. Kashinath Vaman Lele was the editor of the journal Dharma, but the book gives no indication that it was published in the journal, except saying that the book was published by Lele, Sampādaka "Dharma". He also published an edition of Rudrabhāṣya containing only the Sanskrit texts of commentaries. I have a pdf of this second publication and would be glad to share it with you, if it is of any use to you. The book with Marathi translation is not in great condition, but if you want a few pages, I can somehow scan them.

  Dr. Bhagyalata Pataskar, the current director of the Vaidika SamshodhanMandalin Pune, is on the BVP, and can hopefully respond to your queries. Dr. Dharmadhikari, from what I understand, is not in good health to respond to academic questions.
