Thank you for the off-the-list advice on this query.

It seems that contacting Vaidika Samsodhana Mandala is the most popular suggestion that was given. The reasoning is, since TN Dharmadhikari had certainly seen and studied Lele's work in detail when editing Taittiriya Samhita in 1970-90, there might still be someone at the publisher's office who can point towards finding Lele's work now.

  

Question: does anybody on the list know someone from this publishing house in person? If so, could you please help?

  

Thank you,

Irene
