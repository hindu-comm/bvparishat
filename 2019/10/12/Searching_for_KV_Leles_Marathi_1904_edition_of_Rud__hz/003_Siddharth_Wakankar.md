Dr. Irene,

  

Any senior scholar from Pune,like Dr. Saroja Bhate,who I think is on their committee, Dr.Madhav Deshpande or Dr. Ashok Aklujkar could be of much help in this regard.

  

In fact,you also can write to Dr.Bhagyalata Pataskar who is the Director of the V.S Mandal.

  

All of them are on BVP.

  

Best of luck in your sincere and hectic efforts.  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
