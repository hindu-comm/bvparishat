Dear Niranjan ji,

  

I replied to this post, which I received yesterday too, that the editor of the pdf that I have of Bhaktirasayanam, has cited this verse in his foreword. I could not search in the text proper as I could not give the time for it. If it had been a searchabledocument, I would have tried.

  

warm regards

subbu
