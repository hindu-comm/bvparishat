Namaste,

  

लैङ्ग० उ० खं० stands for Linga Purana Uttara Khanda. As per Vedanta Karikavali the exact location is Linga Purana Uttara Khanda, chapter 9, verse 19.  

<https://archive.org/details/vedantakarikavali/page/n175>

  

But, this verse is not found in Lingapurana available in print, though Uttara Khanda 9th chapter contains a definition of Bhakti.
