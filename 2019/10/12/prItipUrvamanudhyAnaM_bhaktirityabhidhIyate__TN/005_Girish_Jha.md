 Dear Shankara ji,

Namaskarah.

After a long duration I contact you. Last year you had kindly uploaded

the Critical edition of SrimadBhagavata Purana for which we sanskritists are ever

grateful to you.

At present I would like to draw your attention to a book ,"Krishna madhava cintamanih"-a memorial volume in honour of a great Naiyayika Pt Krishnamadhava Jha of Mithila.His son Dr Kishorenath Jha,Ex-Principal,Kendriya Sanskrit Vidyapith,Guruvayur wants to offer this book for free downloading in the interest of scholars.

Now I request you to let me know what I should do for it.

Regards,

Sincerely

Girish K.Jha
