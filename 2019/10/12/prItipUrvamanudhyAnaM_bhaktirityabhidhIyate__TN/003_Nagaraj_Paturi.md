The second half of this line is found in

  

मोक्षकरणसमग्रयां भक्तिरेव गरियसी ।  
**स्वस्वरूपानुसन्धानं *भक्तिरित्यभिधीयते*** ॥ ३२ ॥

  

from Vivekachudamani.

  

With this as second half , there seem to be some expressions like

  

ईश्वरे परमं प्रेम,भक्तिरित्यभिधीयते। आसक्तिविषय प्रेम देहदारागृहादिषु।। 6।।<https://www.punjabkesari.in/dharm/news/real-meaning-of-bhakti-638395>

  

All these may be running as per a template though we may not be able to locate the prototype for all these.
