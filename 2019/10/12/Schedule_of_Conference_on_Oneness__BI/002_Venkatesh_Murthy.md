Namaste

  

Very nice program. One small comment. The organizers should have given time for Sayam Sandhyavandana in the schedule. They cannot expect followers of Varnashrama Dharma to go directly to dinner in the evening without performing Sayam Sandhya. In many Goshthis I have seen they make time for Sayam Sandhya and then continue.
