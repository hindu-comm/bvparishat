Namaste

  

It is not correct to keep any session during Sandhya time. Why should people made to leave the session and come back after some time? They may miss some important points in the Vakyartha Sadas when they are absent. Why create this problem? There should be an interval of 20-30 minutes. The others may say they can do Sandhya after 8 PM also, But better to do it at the correct time. Sandhya after stars have appeared is inferior Sandhya.
