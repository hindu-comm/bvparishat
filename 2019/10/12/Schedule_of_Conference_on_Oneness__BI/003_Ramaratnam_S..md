I think there is free time between 5 and 6 in the evening. One can perform Sandhya around 5-45 p.m. and join the rest at 6. It is not difficult. Even if some session were to be on, it is not difficult to
snatch some time in between and perform one's own duties. Nobody is going to question it. It is all the more easier in an ashram like atmosphere in Sri Sankara Nilayam.
