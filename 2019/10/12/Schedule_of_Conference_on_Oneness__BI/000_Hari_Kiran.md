Pranaams to all,

  

The biggest show on Advaita in recent times is getting underway next week at Veliyanad, Kerala.

  

Attached is the scheduleof speakers and sessions for the three days.

  

Deep gratitude to the entire team at Chinmaya for their prompt responses and warm hospitality.

  

Also a big thank you to our very own Dr Nagraj Paturiji who has worked tirelessly in putting together this conference along with the young and dynamic Tulasi Kumar Joshi from Chinmaya.

  

Look forward to welcomingyou all to this unique conference.
