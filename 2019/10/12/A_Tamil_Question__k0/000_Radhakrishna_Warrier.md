என்ன தவம் செய்தனை, யசோதா  

என்ன தவம் செய்தனை...



Eṉṉa tavam ceytaṉai, Yacōtā

Eṉṉa tavam ceytaṉai ...

"What penance did you do, O Yaśōdā, for the all pervasive Para Brahman to call you, crying out, Ammaa (mother)"?

  

My knowledge of Tamil is meager, hence asking this question. Is
செய்தனை (ceytaṉai) valid grammatically?



I know செய்தாய் (ceytāy) where the subject would be “nī”, நீ, which is “you” in singular. I also know ceytaṉa (செய்தன) where the subject would be avai (அவை) meaning those. What would be the subject, implied or explicit of ceytaṉai (செய்தனை)?
