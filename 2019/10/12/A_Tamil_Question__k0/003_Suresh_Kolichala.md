In general, diphthongs are not considered natively phonemic in the Dravidian languages. Although *ai* and *au* (Tamil, ஐ, ஔ) are part of the scripts of several Dravidian languages, they are not phonemically distinguished with the sequence of of vowel + semivowel (*ay*, *aw*, respectively). For instance, in Telugu *aunu* (ఔను) and *avnu* (అవును \~ అవ్‌ను) are phonemically equivalent. Similarly, in Kannada *haudu* (ಹೌದು) and *havdu* (\< ಹವುದು) should be equivalent. However, in the modern varieties of these languages, the educatedtend to prefer the use of diphthongs (*ai*, *au*) over glided vowel (*ay*, *aw* etc), as there is a perception that the pronunciation with glide is incorrect or illiterate.
