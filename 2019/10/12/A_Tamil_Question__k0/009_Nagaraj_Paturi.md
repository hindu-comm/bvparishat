\> Most of the words mentioned by SrI Nagaraj pAturi gAru can also be written as ayi. paina -> payina. In dESi Telugu, ai and au can be replaced by ayi and avu. But aiSvarya cannot be written as ayiSvarya as it is a Sanskrit word.

  

Dear Sri J K Mohana Rao garu,

  

The issue has two different aspects:

  

1\. Historical Linguistic

  

2\. Descriptive Linguistic which is what is covered by traditional grammars like Balavyakaranamu.

  

Ai in Telugu is in fact a variant of ayi is not a historically valid observation. What I showed is that all ai in des'ya Telugu words are not essentially derived from the ayi which is derived from the verb root agu.

  

What descriptive grammars such as Balavyakaranamu say is that classical Telugu poets used ayi forms as variants of ai forms. Such variants do exist in Tamil too.

  

But historically all the ai words are not derived from ayi words.

  

For example, agu+ ina = ayina \> aina

  

ettu+ agu+ ina \> ettayina \> ettaina

  

But mai = body is not derived from \*mayi .

  

Classical poets did write mai as mayi . But that does not mean mai = body is derived from \*mayi .
