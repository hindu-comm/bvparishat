Tamil is best described in terms of its own traditional grammar.

  

Sutra 4 of 'eḻuttatikāram' in the traditional Tamil grammar *Tolkāppiyam* says

  

ā ī ū ē ai  
ō au eṉṉum appāl ēḻum  
īraḷa picaikkum neṭṭeḻut teṉpa.

  

which means

  

'The 7 soundsā ī ū ē aiō au which are of two measures are called long sounds'.

  

Here measure (aḷapu) indicates prosodic quantity.

  

Hope this helps,

  

Srini
