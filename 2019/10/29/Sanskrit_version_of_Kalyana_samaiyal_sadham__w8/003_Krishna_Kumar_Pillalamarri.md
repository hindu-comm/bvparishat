Originally this is a song from the 1957 Telugu film, "Maayaabazaar". The song runs as 'vivaahabhOjanambu', and was dubbed in Tamil later. This is a wildly popular film even today. The actor is SV Ranga Rao, highly acclaimed. Good attempt at rendering this in Sanskrit. Best wishes.

Krishna Kumar Pillalamarri
