Namaskaram!  
  
  
I am searching for the author of the below lines:  
  
"संगीतमपिसाहित्यं सरस्वत्याः स्तनद्वयम्\|  
एकमापातमधुरमഽन्यदालोचनामृतम्“  
  
These lines are quite popular in South India. I vaguely remember reading these lines in a Kavyalakshana text - forgot the title of the text.  
Can someone here please help me? Any help will be greatly appreciated.  
  
Thank you!
