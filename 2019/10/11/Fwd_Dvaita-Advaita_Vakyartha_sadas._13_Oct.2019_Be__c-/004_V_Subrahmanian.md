Please long on to Sri Narahari Sumadhwa's FB page to view the many video recordings of the vakyartha. Thanks for his efforts. It was a lovely treat yesterday. The intellectual acumen of the scholars who participated came to the fore. Mm Sri Krishnamurthy Sastrigal, in his address said: Such discussions/debates should go on as they benefit all parties involved. If Sri Vyasa Tirtha's Nyayamruta critiquing the Advaita doctrine had not come, we would not have had the Advaita Siddhi of Madhusudana Saraswati.
