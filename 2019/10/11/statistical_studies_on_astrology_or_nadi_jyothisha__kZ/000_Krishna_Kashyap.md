Namaskara,

  

If this question is not appropriate, please delete it.

  

I do understand that astrology or Jyotisha is an anga of Vedas. It is definitely possible that the external environmental effects including planetary forces have an effect on the birth, formation, and future of a foetus.

  

To start with, has anyone published papers to assess the validity of predictions based of astrology in a scientific manner?

  

I am sure astrology is of source of great professional and academic interest for many. My interest is mainly to assess the truth and validity of that science (satyAnvEshaNa).

  

I heard that some papers were published which have proven that astrology predictions are more than 60 percent accurate, which is quite a feat, considering the complexity of prediction of future. Though "60 percent right " may give this science some validity, the bad effects caused by 40 percent erroneous predictions / advice may have wrecked thousands of lives beyond repair!

  

I am interested in understanding the validation studies conducted if any and what to use Astrology for and what not to use it.

  

My understanding is that the main purpose of astrology was to fix muhurtas for yajnas and yaagas. However, later on, people started extending it to match horoscopes for marriages and predict future events for people.

  

Thanks.
