Namaste Krishna Kashyap ji



1. On \< has anyone published papers to assess the validity of predictions based of astrology in a scientific manner? \> : We have enough data , fairly organized and available ( live and ongoing) on hand, which can be taken up by those interested for ' scientific
study'.



Reg. access to these data details, pl. contact me off line .



Before that, I need to make a point very clear.



Modern Science researchers / curio-analysts have very skewed and negative, closed mind set and pre-formed opinions on what 'Science part of Vedanga Jyotisha is, was and should do ! '. The traditional practitioners have equally seriously erroneous mapping of traditional teaching to modern science terms.



The crisscross skewed understanding starts with the very base and basics of the ' technical terms of Jyotisha aka Jyotir-Yoga ( like Graha, Nakshatra) which is the ' Yoga-Samskrutham'- vedanga pedagogy of Jyotisha ( like dealing with Karma-phala, Devataa-parihara, Concept of Sacred and auspicious Time (= Kaala- Purusha / Kalaatmaa -sarvabhootaatmaa / Muhrutha), the Time divisions ( kaala-vibhaaga), et al. 



The study-research becomes much more complex by the ' Panchanga- Ganitha differentials ( sayana/ Nirayana/ Nakshatra vyapti- ayanaamsha), unspecified mixes of eighteen Jyotisha Siddhantas with the 20th century variations within the traditional schools ( Jaimini ,
Kerala Parashara, Ashtakavarga, Naadi , KP system,....) and global astrology schools with ' history' as a lens to study the mystic' using language models from Greek, Chinese, Ceylonese, Mayan, Western practices of Kabalistic teams.



Therefore, it would probably wiser to first set the ground norms, frame of study, parameters of study, the purpose and other referential of pedagogy to study-research in Jyotisha as a ' Vedic Yoga-Science technique provided to see / infer, transparently through the Time and unfoldment of ' forces that are influencing the Human life events, thoughts and relations' ( = Karma-Phala- Yogas).



Modern Science teams would address this approach as a research study in understanding the Consciousness - Matter - Time - Thought- Intuition - Life force and fields, Bio-energies......





2. On \< My interest is mainly to assess the truth and validity of that science (satyAnvEshaNa). \>

Welcome . Let us work together, keeping aside all our legacy baggage to one side and start understanding the opening statement from ' Gita' explaining the following terms / statements , critical to Vedanga Jyotisha ( just to begin with). If these three terms , can be aligned to science understanding between 'vedanta frame work', we would have a good start.

Kaala, Karma, Daiva, Jeeva, Ashta-Prakruti, Yajna, ' Nakshatraanaam aham shashi', 'daivam chaivaatra panchamam',





3. On \< I heard that some papers were published which have proven that astrology predictions are more than 60 percent accurate, which is quite a feat, considering the complexity of prediction of future.
Though "60 percent right " may give this science some validity, the bad effects caused by 40 percent erroneous predictions / advice may have wrecked thousands of lives beyond repair! I am interested in understanding the validation studies conducted if any and what to use Astrology for and what not to use it. \> : :



Even one isolated case of total success or failure could trigger the requisite interest to understand the phenomenon ! When the statistical distribution is 60--40, it would certainly deserve a closer look, objectively. The investigation to the VALIDATION SYSTEM FOR VEDNAGA JYOTISHA begins with understanding the basic template. Soccer cannot be validated using ping-pong game rules.





4. On \< My understanding is that the main purpose of astrology was to fix muhurtas for yajnas and yaagas. However, later on, people started extending it to match horoscopes for marriages and predict future events for people.\> :



The main purpose of Vedanga Jyotisha is ' Purushartha, Paramartha, Kaala-Brahma- Jijnyaasaa Meemaamsaa Anushaasanam, (tri-)Kaala- Jyoti-Darshanam.

The narrowest, misleading statement of this is : Vednaga Jyoths was to fix muhurtas for Yajnas and Yaagas. The further poorest translation of this concept widespread misunderstanding is ' Vedic Astrology' is sooth saying craft, match-making table provider, Faith belief system to fool gullible people in the name of 'angry planets' and extract money to please them' !



The 'satya-darshan' samshodhana needs 'dhana ( investment of time and resources)' and 'shrama' ( effort ) to understand Vedanga Jyotisha and how it serves the purpose of 'Veda'.



If the purpose of veda is wrongly postulated as a ' ritual science (Yajna-karma) '; and 'Vedanta ( philosophy) as high thinking to find ultimate truth through rational reason (tarka) alone', then Vedanga Jyotisha satya will never come out of its shell ! Some of the names in Vishnu Sahasranama will then become meaningless !
