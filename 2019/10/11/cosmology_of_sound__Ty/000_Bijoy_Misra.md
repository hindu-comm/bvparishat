Dear friends,

  

Irene Galstian did ask the basis of my statements which I thought I had

expressed before. From my background I see the speech as the most

fundamental human trait besides our breath. It begs the larger question

on what sound is and where its origin is. The scientific basis leads us

to cosmology. From the creation of the universe we enter into biology  

and the design of life. When we fail to untangle, we invoke opinions and

assumptions.

  

Our group here tries to create a road map to understand speech. Our  

progress is slow and our audience is limited. We use Sanskrit as a basis

to help develop a theory, but our model is expected to transcend language.

Our current probe is to check on the thought segmentation to convert

to muscle movements for expression. I am sharing a video of a seminar

we did last December. Interested people may connect to me if you

have mathematical and scientific interest.

Best regards,
