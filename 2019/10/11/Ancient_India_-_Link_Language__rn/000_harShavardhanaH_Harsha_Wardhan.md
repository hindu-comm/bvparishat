pranAm to all,  
  

A small doubt: In ancient Bharat, there were several coeval languages and dialects used by people in different regions.

  

How did people from different regions then converse with each other? Was Samskrita then routinely used as the link language, the common linguistic meeting ground?

  

Is there any mention of link language usage of Samskrita in our texts or histories?

  

Were there also any other methods used, such as employing translators, etc?

  

Your guidance would be most welcome.

  

kind regards

harsha
