Dear members,

I remember a shloka from NaiSadhacarita where DevabhASA SaMskRta has been mentioned as link language to avoid the difficulty of understanding different languages among the kings of various kingdoms assembled at DamayantI's SvayaMvara sabhA and also among the deities present there on the occasion:

  

anyonyabhASAnavabodhabhIteH saMskRtrimAbhir vyavahAravatsu/

digbhyaH sameteSu nRpeSu teSu

sauvargavargo na janair acihni//.

  

Best
