Dear Mr Prasad,  
  
Since the original question was aimed at Uhle's edition of Śivadāsa's  
version, my bibliographical information only referred to it. I assume  
you are aware that there are several Sanskrit versions of the  
Vetālapañcaviṃśati:  
  
-- Kṣemendra's version (Bṛhatkathāmañjarī 9.2.19-1221)  
-- Somadeva's version (Kathāsaritsāgara, 12th book \[lambaka\], taraṅga  
8-32 \[chapters 75-99\])  
-- Śivadāsa's version (Uhle)  
-- Vallabhadāsa's version (see below)  
-- Jambhaladatta's version (critically edited by M.B. Emeneau, New  
Haven, Connecticut: American Oriental Society 1934 \[American Oriental  
Series. 4\])  
  
See Jacob Schmidt-Madsen: Repossessing the Past -- authorial tradition  
and scribal innovation in Śivadāsa's Vetālapañcaviṃśatikā. 2014. -- A  
"revised edition" of his "MA thesis submitted in the Department of  
Indology at the University of Copenhagen, Denmark" can be downloaded here:

See p. 46 f., fn. 73 of Schmidt-Madsen's thesis:  
"73 Adheesh Sathaye of the University of British Columbia has been  
collecting manuscripts of ŚVP \[= Śivadāsa's version of the  
Vetālapañcaviṃśati cycle of tales\] for a number of years, and is  
currently in possession of close to a hundred such manuscripts. All  
information reproduced here regarding his manuscripts has kindly been  
supplied by him."  
  
p. 46 f.: "No manuscripts of VVP \[= Vallabha or Vallabhadāsa's  
sub-version of ŚVP\] have as yet been published, nor has any serious  
study of the material been undertaken \[fn. 74: Sathaye (see fn. 73) is  
currently preparing a digitized critical edition of VVP based on a  
dozen or so manuscripts. Further speculation on the relationship  
between ŚVP and VVP will have to await its publication.\] Recently,  
however, three manuscripts of ŚVP which give the full name and title  
of the author as kāyasthavallabhaśivadāsa were discovered by Adheesh  
Sathaye \[fn. 75: One manuscript, dated saṃvat 1458 (1401 CE), is  
currently held in the Oriental Institute, Baroda (acc. no. 25804),  
while another manuscript, undated but possibly 17th century, is in the  
Bhandarkar Oriental Institute, Pune (access no. 353). A third  
manuscript, also in the Bhandarkar Oriental Institute, Pune (acc. no.  
793), dated saṃvat 1735 and śaka 1600 (1678 CE), is listed under  
"Śivadāsa", though the colophon gives the full name as  
Vallabhaśivadāsa.\]."  
  
Best,  
Roland Steiner
