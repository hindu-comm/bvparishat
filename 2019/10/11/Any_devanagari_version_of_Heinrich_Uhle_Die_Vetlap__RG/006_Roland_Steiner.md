I shouldn't have written "more important." In 1881 Uhle edited  
Śivadāsa's version on the basis of 11 modern manuscripts, whereas in  
1914 he published a manuscript (dated 1487), which is much earlier  
than any of the other manuscripts. His 1881 edition also contains a  
short (secondary) prose recasting of Kṣemendra's version.
