Dear Friends,

  

Some 10/15 years ago,I helped Shri Adheesh Sathaye, to get xerox copies of the Vetalapanchavinshati from Vadodara,Jodhpur and Ahmedabad.

  

I think,he is the best person to enlighten us on this question,as by now,he must have completed his project on Vetala.. and I exactly don't remember the other details of authors and editions etc.

  

I mark a copy of this mail to him,so that any one can contact him in this regard.I think,he was the In-charge of the Canada World Skt.Confe. and must be known to many scholars.

  

Trust,he helps us in this regard.

  

Best of luck in our efforts and search.  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
