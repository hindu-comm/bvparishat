Subject: \[INDOLOGY\] ECSAS 2020 CfP for Designing Water: Morphology, Ecology and Histories of Waterscapes in South Asia  
To: \<[indo...@list.indology.info]()\>  

  
  
Dear List Members,  
  
In representation of the convenor Jutta Jain-Neubauer I would like to  
draw your attention to the Call for Papers for the ECSAS 2020 panel  
"Designing Water: Morphology, Ecology and Histories of Waterscapes in  
South Asia."  
  
The panel intends to explore innovative narratives of water structures  
in terms of their eco-historical, socio-political and aesthetic siting,  
beyond the conventional art historical parameters, and breaking the  
boundaries of hitherto often tightly fenced disciplines.  
More details can be found at the panel website:  
<https://ecsas2020.univie.ac.at/panels/1zbrn/>  
  
As stated by others before, the Call for Papers at ECSAS closes on  
November 17. Submissions are very welcome.  
  
Best wishes,  
Vitus Angermeier
