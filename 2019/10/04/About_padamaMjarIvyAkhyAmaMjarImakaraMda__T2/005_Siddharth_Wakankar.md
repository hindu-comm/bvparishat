Dear Ashvini,

  

The N.C.C.gives info.about the printed books/editions also if that [ms.is](http://ms.is) published or any paper is written on it.

  

So,if no information about any printed edition is given,you may safely say or conjecture that the MSS. are not studied and published.

  

By the way,in which place/places the MSS.are preserved.

  

Best of luck in your research on a rare and unpublished text on Vyakarana.

  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
