Hello Ashvini,

  

  To the best of my knowledge, the commentary Mañjarī-Makaranda has not been published yet. So preparing and publishing a critically edited version of this commentary will be a wonderful research contribution.
Will be happy to help you any way I can. Keep in touch. With best wishes,
