Many promininent scholars do have commemoration and felicitation volumes by admirers of the scholars. While publishing these commemoration and felicitation volume it would be good idea if the well meaning friends of the scholars make all the published and unpublished works of the scholars available in place. That would indeed be a great tribute to the scholar for all his life the scholars concerned would have struggled to make his views and knowledge he has gathered to be made accessible to all those who are interested.
