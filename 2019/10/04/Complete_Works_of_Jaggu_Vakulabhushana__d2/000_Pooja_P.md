Namaste,

  

Some of the works of the poet JagguVakulabhushana were available on archive till some time ago. But all but one have been removed. My query to the learned groups is - has anyone published all of his works together in one/set of publications? Where can one get access to all his works in one place? I am able to find a couple of them on the internet, but not all.

  

Thanks,

Pooja
