Many thanks. I downloaded the poet's collection of plays. There are two introductory write-ups in Kannada ( one by the famous Kannada poet Putina and the other by the younger brother of the poet), which give a glimpse of a culture fast disappearing, nay which has already vanished.

Regards,  
Murthy
