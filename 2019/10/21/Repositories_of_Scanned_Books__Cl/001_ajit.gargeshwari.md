Many of the links mention at [https://sanskritdocuments.org](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fsanskritdocuments.org%2Fscannedbooks%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNEYr2-7uvw2HiFyjEbL1vX6_DwP2g) are outdated and don't work. All the books that listed there are available at [archives.org](http://archives.org). If you are looking into digital resources as pdfs please search [archives.org](http://archives.org). first you will find most of what is available.
