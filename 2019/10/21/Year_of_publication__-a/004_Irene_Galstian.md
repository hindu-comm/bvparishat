Dear Marek,

  

I went to the library being almost 100% sure that the date in the book would be 1973, since all the librarians cataloguing this book all over the world are unlikely to be wrong. And it was 1973 (please see attached). I looked through other items from this series, and the 1st volume dates from 1958, so 1956 could be a typo on some part of the print run or who knows what mysterious happening. This doesn't tell you what happened, but it seems that both dates refer to the same physical object.

  

Best wishes,

Irene
