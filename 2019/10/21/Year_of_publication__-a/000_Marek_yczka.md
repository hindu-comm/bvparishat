Respected Scholars,

what is the publication year of the follow book:  

<https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.467656/page/n1>  

  

1956, as it's printed or 1973, as it's given at almost all places where various Authors refere to it?

Only Ganguly has also provided the date 1956:  
Ganguly, Krishna Chakravorty (1993), A Bibliography of Nyāya Pilosophy, Calcutta: The National Library, p. 63.  

  

Can we check ifCalcutta Sanskrit College Research Series No. LXXIX and the date 1956 are accurate?

  

Kind regards,

Marek,

a navya- nyāya resaercher
