To speak in a lighter vein,

I have seen a book published in 2012,

but due to carelessness in proof-reading,

it shows the publication year as 2021!

On the cover page!  

  

And a somewhat mischievous one:

a book with an intentional error as I could surmise :  

to show he is up to date or is ahead of times  

or rather just smart salesmanship to grab the market,

a book already in the stalls in 2008

but with a printed publication date as 2009!
