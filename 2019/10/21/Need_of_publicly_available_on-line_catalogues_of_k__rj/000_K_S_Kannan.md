Only very few libraries in India have their  

library catalogues available for consultation on-line.

  

Now, can we have a list of them that have

(and a list of those that do not have,

so that they may be persuaded to prepare one and make available on-line)?

  

If there are libraries that are funded by the Government,

it must be made mandatory (by the Govt.)

that they must provide such on-line catalogues.

All in public interest.
