I have an NRI friend. She asked me about some sources to read in knowing ideas like Sovereign, Republic, Democracy or something related to Rajneeti in Ancient Bharatiya scriptures as part of her thesis. What was the view that Ancient Hindu scriptures carried, Mahabharata Ramayana etc.  
  
I asked her to read Chanakya Niti, Arthashastra and books on Shukraneeti. Also asked her to read Mahabharata and Ramayana to get an idea herself. But this has also sprung up my curiosity. If at all there are already any researches done in this field.  
  
I found a useful thread here itself. <https://groups.google.com/forum/m/#!searchin/bvparishat/%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%9C%E0%A4%A8%E0%A5%80%E0%A4%A4%E0%A4%BF/bvparishat/hmDVp1c-bfs>  
  
But, she doesn't know Hindi.  
So for her, if there are any English sources, please say, but Hindi/Gujarati sources are fine for me to understand.

Now, this is my query. Previously, it was her query. I'd also like to know about a philosophical interpretation on Kautilya Arthashastra, and some research which has a comparitive studies on Ancient and Modern Economics. Or how Chanakya Arthashastra can be viewed in today's age.  
  
Also, are there any other sources to Rajneeti, other than Chanakya and Shukra?
