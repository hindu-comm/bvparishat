I heard this sad news from Professor Shrikant Bahulkar. Professor Dhadphale was my teacher from my first year at the Fergusson College and also taught Pali for the M.A. classes at the Pune University. He was excellent in bringing out the poetic beauty of Sanskrit dramas like the Uttararāmacarita and directed staging of Sanskrit dramas at the college in which I participated. A prolific a scholar, Dhadphale published 37 books. He was very loving and caring to his students, and I have fond memories of the times I spent with him.
