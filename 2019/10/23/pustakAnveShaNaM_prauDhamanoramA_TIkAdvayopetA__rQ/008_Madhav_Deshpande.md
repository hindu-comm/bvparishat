Thank you, Shri Lalitalalita Ji,

  

  I have the complete part I of this publication in a print copy, but was not able to get hold of the second volume. Now the pdf is available. I hope someone will make the complete pdf of the first volume. It is a very useful publication, and especially valuable is the extensive introduction by Sitaram Shastri discussing the relationship between the Br̥hat and Laghu Śabdaratna commentaries. I have used this introduction along with these two commentaries in my own research. With best regards,
