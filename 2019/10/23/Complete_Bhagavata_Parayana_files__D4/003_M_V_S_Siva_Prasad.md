I am the person who cries alot after watching the link placed here.

I searched for the male voice of Srimad Bhagavatam link which is chapter wise but failed to locate it .

Iam placing the chapter wise moola parayanam nearly from January which is downloaded from the mantra transe website. It has several issues of pronunciation but being naisthiks on the group it became mandatory for me to post the male voice.

Nearly 240 members at present are having parayana audio . At present we are in 10 skandha .

If I succeeded to locate it before a year they may have an audio without mistakes in pranounciation.

Being they are habituated to the previous one i can't replace it at now .

Iam crying because of that.

The Ramayana Parayana pronounced very well by a vedic scholar namely Srirama Ghanapathi ji placed in the ramayana whatsapp group.

But for Bhagavatam i faced the problem.

I thank you at first for the link . Atleast from the 2nd parayana i have the possibility to place this one.

But I want to know about the copyright issue of it ?

So please tell me about the copyright issue also.

  

Thank you.
