That is correct (Suvṛttatilaka 2.4-5). Nevertheless, the metrical  
pattern x – υ – – υ υ x (tadanvaye śuddhimati) is not a special  
feature of Kālidāsa, but can be generally observed in the various  
genres of Sanskrit literature (not only in kāvya) and is partly  
(syllables 5-7 in the 1st and/or 3rd pāda: – υ υ) described by the  
metricians.
