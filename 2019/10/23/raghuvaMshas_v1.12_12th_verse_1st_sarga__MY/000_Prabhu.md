1. In most sources online, raghuvaMsha’s first pAda of the12th verse in the 1st sarga

seems a bit odd and sounds likewise when recited:

  

त द न्व ये शु द्धि म ति

प्र सू तः शु द्धि म त्त रः  \|

दि ली प इ ति रा जे न्दु

रि न्दुः क्ष्ही र नि धा वि व \|\|1.12

  

In H-K convention:

tadanvaye zuddhimati

prasUtaH zuddhimattaraH \|

dilIpa iti rAjendu

rinduH kShIranidhAviva  \|\|1.12

  

The first pAda’s 5th, 6th and 7th akshara-s are in \_ U U (ie., long, short, short) pattern.

त द न्व ये शु द्धि म ति  \<=== \_ U U pattern

. . .

  

In contrast the 3rd pAda

दि ली प इ ति रा जे न्दु  \<=== is more in the more canonical U \_ \_ pattern

  

All other verses in 1st sarga seem to conform to the usual anushTup conventions.

(...hopefully I did not miss any similar to v1.12)

  

2. Also isn’t there a rule/convention that requires forming sandhi in

दि ली प + इ ति

  

Is there a different pAthAntara of this verse?

Prabhu
