Dear List Members,

  

Please see the attachment.

  

A grihasta has taken the onus to get the complete Srimad Bhagavatam with all mula shlokas chanted by a Rig Veda Ghanapati into a pendrive.

  

The pre-order price is Rs. 1190 including GST and consists of 55 hours of immaculate chanting.

  

The contact person for ordering is:

  

Manoj[+91 92498 93537](tel:+91%2092498%2093537)

  

The Pendrive will be delivered to your address.

Apparently the date of shipping will be Jan 14. If you need it earlier, kindly contact Manoj.

  

Kind Regards,

  

Venkat
