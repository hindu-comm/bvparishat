Namaskars from Samskrit Promotion Foundation.

Summary of this conference is as follows

1. TCS is ready to offer its TCSiON (Learning Platform) for all the Samskrit Universities (SU) for offering the digital courses.

2\. TCS is ready to guide the SU in Industry Honor Certified Programs.(IHC) (Job assured programs)

3\. TCS-IGNITE recruits BA BSc graduates from across the country through an entrance exam. TCS provides training and later absorbs the candidates if suitable. TCS IGNITE team is ready to interact with SUs to offer to their students too.

  

For me, take away from this conference is

1\. SUs have got an opportunity to create quality digital content.

2\. SUs can collaborate and quickly offer complete suite of courses required for BA & MA level.

3\. SUs can offer short term courses in foreign languages too.

4\. IHC is a great concept for the Universities to reach out to industries other than government for jobs. It might change environment in colleges. New Labs may come in each SU depending up on the sector they opt.

5\. Consolidation of language tools already developed.

6\. Bringing every science back in to Samskrit Universities which were weaned away.

  

One more point, TCS is ready to throw open TCSiON for Samskrit NGOs too to offer courses.

Hon. Members who participated in the conference can add any other point left out.

  

Namaskars.
