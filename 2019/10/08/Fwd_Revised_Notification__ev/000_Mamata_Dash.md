Respected Scholars

Hope you have received the notice sent earlier regarding the “Instructional Course on Indian Sciences” being organised by the Prof. K V Sarma Research Foundation at Chennai during November 27 to December 1, 2019.

We are glad to inform you that there has been an overwhelming response to this Course both from the resource persons that we contacted and the students, researchers and scholars who have sought to participate in this Course.

  

In order to enable such of those who might have missed the earlier circular, we are sending it once again. Since the Course is being organised in a spacious auditorium, we can accommodate some more participants in addition to those who have already applied.

We request all those who would like to attend the Course to write to us at the following e-mail address on or before (the revised deadline of) October 20, 2019: [prof...@gmail.com]().

  

Also, since we have been fortunate to receive adequate financial support for this Course, we have decided to waive the registration fee of Rs. 1,000 for all the participants of the Course.

Mamata Dash (Mishra),
