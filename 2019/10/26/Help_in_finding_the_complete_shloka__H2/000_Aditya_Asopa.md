Dear Friends,

  

I know of a shloka that says (roughly)  

  

> 
> > "...crows are worshipped amongst cranes...Where there are no trees, > even airand (castor) trees get worshipped."  
> > 

  

This context is that amongst the ignorants or people without knowledge, even an unworthy is valued, just as castor tree is worshipped in the land where there are no trees.

I am trying to find the complete shloka in Sanskrit but can't remember.

Could someone please help

Thanks

\-
