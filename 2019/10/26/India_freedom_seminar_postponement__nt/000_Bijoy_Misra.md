Friends,

We moved our India Freedom seminar from November 2 to November 30.

We just could not get ready. The material is manifold and massive. We

are struggling to wrap around.

The project of finding freedom songs has not produced good results besides

the early suggestions from Prof Paturi and Prof Deshpande. I would continue  

to look for curated material. Please dig recollection if something did influence

you or was taught to you when you were young. You may do Google search to  

help recollection to get the lyrics but not to search for the tune.
Tunes and nouns  

in our brains stay frozen from early childhood. You can let me know if recollection

succeeds.

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
