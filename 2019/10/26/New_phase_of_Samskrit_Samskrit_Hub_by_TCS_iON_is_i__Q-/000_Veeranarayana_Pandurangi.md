Dear all

as already noticed by V Subrahmanian and others on this forum too,

New phase of Samskrit, "Samskrit Hub" by TCS iON is inaugurated by S Ramadorai, Ex Vice Chairman of TCS in the Samskrit Conclave held on 20 in Bengaluru.

TCS iON , TCS group company, is dedicated to the Education and promotion of education. (you can visit iON webpage)

Now, iON has come forward to extend its expertise and service to Samskrit to set up Samskrit Hub, one stop solution for all computer related activities like Texts Repositories, online courses, digital communities, Industry Honor Courses, Promotional activities etc. thanks to visionary leadershipof Samskrit Promotion foundation led by Dr. Cha Mu Krishnashastri, Dr. Chand Kiram Saluja, and others.

Samskrit Hub was shown to the Vice Chancellors of 13 samskrit universities and others from different institutions present there.

  

In my opinion, it is game changer for samskrit. Samskrit students will surely climb up corporate ladders in future with the help of Software training courses offered by TCS Ignite. Students will be able to get good english education as well.

  

It will be helpfull to millions of samskrit students to get right digital as well as phygital (Physico-digital) course material in fingertips from best samskrit teachers across the world. Samskrit scholars too will be able offer different online courses, (Certificate, diploma, add-on) to students across the world.

  

Thanks to S. Ramadorai. V. Ramaswamy (global head, iON) who personally presented all these things to meetings for taking this initiative. Leadership of Samskrit Promotion foundation needs to contratulated for this initiative.

  

Finally it is left to Samskrit Universities and Colleges to contribute and uitilise these services.
