Raghuram mahodaya,

This point was discussed on the second day. Challenge from IT is just recent addition to the long list. Fear and refraining out of fear is one of main reason for Samskrit retracting from other areas of knowledge where it ruled just 6 decades back. I am sure Sanskrit Scholars exploring every branch of knowledge will not just strengthen that branch but also serve the cause of Samskrit better. Every research paper across the world must be publishedin Samskrit, as the very purpose of Samskrit is to precisely preserve knowledge.
