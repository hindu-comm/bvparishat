On the other hand, this is also really scary. So far samskrita was left untouched by the greed of corporate industry. Like the way all want to become software engineers, now if samskrita scholars also go this way, God save our traditional ways . No one would want to pursue it . I am sound pessimistic but this was my greatest fear. We are not getting not just samskrita but any good teacher as all want to get into software development.
