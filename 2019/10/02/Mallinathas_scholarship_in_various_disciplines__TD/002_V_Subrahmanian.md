Thanks Shankara ji, that would be a good source for ideas. MM Sri Swaminathan Sharma would often say 'The Kaavya-s should be studied prior to coming to Vedanta. For the kavi-s bring out so many facets of human behaviour .....'.

  

Scholars like SrI S.T.Nagaraj have discoursed at length on Kaavya-shaastra sambandha.

  

warm regards
