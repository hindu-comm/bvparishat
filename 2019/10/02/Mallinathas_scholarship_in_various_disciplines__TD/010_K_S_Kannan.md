Dear Dr Narenthiran,

  

Given the difficulty of fetching articles from old (and even new) Indian journals,

it would be ideal if you can post them here as and when asked.

  

If you are scanning for one person, it will do as well for so many others

\- hardly any extra effort on your part.

Of course, I would not suggest the same  

\- if there are any possibilities of copyright violations,

\- or if BVP has indeed policies not very encouraging about this.

  

I admire your sense of service.

  

\*\*The gates of knowledge will indeed be opened to (even the descendants of)  

 those who open the gates of knowledge for others.\*\*

  

Regards

KSKannan
