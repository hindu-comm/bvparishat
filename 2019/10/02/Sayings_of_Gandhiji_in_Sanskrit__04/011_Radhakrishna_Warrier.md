"*But you maybe right. The Gujarati word itself maybe गान्धी*. "

  

Yes it is a Gujarati word. In modern Gujarati, Gāndhī (ગાંધી) means a grocer.  I have read that the word comes from Gāndhika, meaning a seller of perfumes. The term came to be applied to those who sold not only perfumes but also provisions, i.e., grocers. Gāndhika became Gāndhia and finally Gāndhī.  Some Gujaratis, especially the Parsis have the tendency to transfer the aspiration on the ‘dh’ to ‘g’ while pronouncing the word, and consequently spell the last name as Ghandi in English.  But when writing in Gujarati, they still write it as Gāndhī (ગાંધી).
