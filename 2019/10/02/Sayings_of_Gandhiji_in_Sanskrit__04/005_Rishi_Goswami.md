Thank you Murtiji and Shankarji for providing this book.  
  
Apart from that, I've always wanted to know what Gandhi means. I just think that his name was often mispronounced as गान्धी instead of गन्धी।  
  
Maybe his ancestors were into selling fragrances, hence the name. Maybe गान्धी also has some meaning in Gujarati. I don't know, just thought of posting this here.  
  
Regards  
Rishi
