Dear Vasantmumarji and Shasjiji, thanks for the response.  
  
I'd like to make another assessment here. For example, many words have changed due to English spellings. Some famous personalities who have surname like Basu are pronounced as बासु instead of बसु where it was वसु which became बसु in Bengali.  
  
The name Kunal has become कुनाल instead of कुणाल.  
  
Famous guy Asit Modi being pronounced as आसीत् मोदी instead of असित which means Dark.  
  
So I think it's quite possible in the passage of time, this being mispronounced became a norm or rather I'd say became normal.  
  
But you maybe right. The Gujarati word itself maybe गान्धी.  
  
Thankyou  
Namaskara
