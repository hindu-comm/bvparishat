Respected scholars,

Selected sayings of Gandhiji are rendered in Sanskrit by Dr. C D Deshmukh in गान्धीसूक्तिमुक्तावली. The first verse is as follows

उत्कटोऽथ विमलो मनोरथो यो भवेत्स परिपूर्यते सदा ।

शश्वदस्य नियमस्य सत्यतां दृष्टवाननुभवेऽहमात्मनः ॥

I have the book. But I failed to locate a soft-version in [archive.org](http://archive.org).

Thanks and regards,

Murthy
