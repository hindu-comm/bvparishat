Dear Friends,

  

There is one Sanskrit word or name,namely, शंतनु, which is most of the times and by many educated persons and scholars also, pronounced as शांतनु.

  

The similar case with proper names like सलिल/ सलील, गिरीश/ गिरिश.

  

Very few of the persons having this name don't understand the difference between meanings of these two.

  

Such instances,due to careless pronunciation,could easily be multiplied.
