Pranaams to all,

  

In continuationof our efforts to perpetuate the memories and the works of the venerable scholars who are no longer amongst us, we have expanded the scope of the Justice Kodanda Rammayaa Memorial Endowment to translation of books written by such scholars from Bharatiya languages into English.

  

We request all the members to take advantage of this scheme and translate the works of your parents, Gurus or scholars whose works have inspired you and pay homage to their memory.

  

You can reach out to us at [nam...@indica.org.in]()
