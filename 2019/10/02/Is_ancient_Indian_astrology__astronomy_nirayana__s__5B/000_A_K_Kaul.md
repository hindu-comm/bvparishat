Respected members of Bharatiya Vidvat Parishad,

Jai Shri Ram!

There is a misconception that ancient Indian astronomy and astrology has been nirayana, which is euphemistically known as sidereal.

It is also believed that (only) Western astrology and astronomy is tropical also known as Sayana.

***Difference between tropical and nirayana:***

First of all we must clarify it a bit as to what the two systems mean.

In the tropical system, Aries i.e Mesha Rashi starts always from the moment of Vernal Equinox, (Vasant Sampaat), when days and nights are equal throughout the world; Cancer ingress (Karkata Samkranti) is the day of Summer Solstice (Dakshinayana) the longest day of the year,
Libra ingress (Tula Samkranti) is the day of Autumn Equinox (Saharat Sampaat) when day is equal to night and Capricorn ingress (Makar Samkranti) the shortest day of the year known as Winter Solstice (Uttarayan).

These rashis are unrelated to nakshatra divisions, whether equal or unequal or even their namesake stars.

On the other hand, Hindu Mesha, Vrisha etc. Rashis are unrelated to seasons and Solstices and Equinoxes etc. but related only to Ashvini, Bharni etc. 27 equal nakshatra divisions and therefore known as sidereal.

These Rashis and/or nakshatras never start from a fixed point though they are supposed to start from some star---sidereal! Every year an arbitrary incremental *ayanamsha* is to be subtracted from the actual tropical longitudes of planets determined by JPL/NASA etc. to arrive at the desired "sidereal" longitudes!

Technically speaking, the latter are imaginary divisions---both nakshatras as well as Rashis and different Rashi-chakras are supposed to have different starting points. Lahiri Rashichakra has a starting point away by about 24 degrees from the Vernal Equinox these days whereas Ramana Rashichakra has a different starting point, the Grahalaghava Rashichakra an entirely different starting point and the Surya Siddhanta Rashichakra a much different starting point and so on. Then again, these starting points will go on changing every year by about 53 arc seconds till eternity!

However, all are supposed to be nirayana (sidereal)

However, all those Rashichakras are supposed to be sidereal!

***Was Varahamhira, the earliest known indigenous astronomer and astrologer, Sayana or Nirayana?***

Varahamihira was around in Shaka 428 i.e 505 AD. He was the most well versed and prolific astrologer and astronomer of his times. His *Panchasiddhantika* is a compilation of five siddhantas which were prevailing in his time, the most prominent one being the well known Surya Siddhanta. His Brihat Samhita is a masterly and encyclopedic astronomical work of mundane astrology as well as planetary motions etc. Similarly, his Brihaj-Jatakam is the earliest indigenous work of genelithical astrological lore. It is a must for anybody who wants to learn predictive astrology and is a prescribed text book in predictive astrology examinations of every college/university.

Though Varahamihira has referred to quite a few astrologers like Satyacharya, Manittha, Maya, Yavana and Parashara etc. as his predecessors but almost all of them are yavanas except for Parashara, who has been said to be the son of Shakti Rishi (and is supposed to be the father of the famous Veda Vyasa).

But the astrological work of Parashara viz. Brihat Parashara Hora Shastram was not available even at the time of Bhatotpala in tenth century CE. Though there are about half a dozen versions of that work available in the market today, with none agreeing with the other, it is extremely doubtful if any of those versions are really authentic especially as none of those editions claims to have been compiled by Maharshi Parashara.

As such, we will have to depend on Varhamihira. As on date, if any astrologer is recognized as the "Varahamihira" he is supposed to have got the "Param-Veera-Chakra" of predictive astrology!

***What type of Rashis has Varahamihira used in his works?***

In III/23 of his *Panchasiddhantika* he has said मेष तुलादौ विषुवं..... "At the first point of Mesha/Aries and Libra/Tula are the Spring and Autumnal Equinoxes when days and nights are equal!......

Then in 25th shloka of the same chapter, Varahamihira has said

 उदगयनं मकरादावृतवः शिशिरादयश्च सूर्यवशात् \| द्विभवनकालसमानम् दक्षिनायणंच कर्कटात् \|\|

"The sun's turning north (Uttarayana -- Winter Solstice) is when it reaches the zero point of Makara (Capricorn) and its turning South (Dakshinayana---Summer Solstice) is when it is at the zero point of Karkata (Cancer) with the attendant sacred days. The seasons Shishira etc. commence with the winter solstice and each season lasts two (tropical) solar months".

The attachments eps2 and eps3 are English translation/commentary on these shlokas by the well known South Indian scholars T S Kuppanna Sastry and Dr. K V Sarma.

Both these scholars have lamented (exactly as I am lamenting now a days!) that all our timings of Vedic rituals have become Topsy turvy because of the "nirayana" mayhem!

Quote

"But confusion there has been and still continues with the result that people call Mesha and even Vrishabha spring months, though patently we have summer then, Kumbha and Mina being practically the spring months now. This confusion has resulted in Madhu, Madhava etc. and Chaitra, Vaishakha etc. as synonyms. People who know are amused, when in the Samkalpa recited for Hindu rituals the month of Rishabh which is advanced Summer, is mentioned as Spring".

The fact of the matter is that Varahamihira has repeated the same thing that we find in the Mana-Adhyaya of the Surya Siddhanta

भानोर्मकर सँक्रान्तेः षण्मासाः उत्तरायणम्। कर्कयादेस्तथैवस्यात् षण्मासाः दक्षणायनँ।।

द्विराशिनाथाः ऋतवस्ततोपि शिशिरादयः।मेषादयो द्वादशैते मासैस्तैरेव वत्सर:।।

As per attachment SS-5, the well known 19thcenturySamskrit scholar of Varanasi, viz. Pandit Sudhakar Dwivedi has minced no words while translating it and has clubbed Uttarayana, the shortest day of the year with Makar Samkranti and so on. He has made it very clear that during the sojourn of the sun in Makar and Kumbha it is Shishira Ritu, during Mina and Mesha it is Vasanta Ritu and so on!

In short, Varahamihira, the most reputed astrologer and astronomer of yore, and the Surya Siddhanta, the earliest Rashi based indigenous astronomical work have talked of and advocated nothing but a tropical i.e. Sayana Rashichakra for astrological and astronomical purposes!

We will further talk about his *Brihat Samhita* and *Brihaj-Jatakam* etc. in the next mail.

Till then, with regards and Jai Shri Ram!
