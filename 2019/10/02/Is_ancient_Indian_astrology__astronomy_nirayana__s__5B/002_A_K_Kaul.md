Sir,

Jai Shri Ram!

I just posted a mail in continuation of the earlier thread, but it has appeared as a single mail in a new thread probably because the heading was ''Is ancient....not!-2" instead of ''Is ancient.....not!-1".

Kindly suggest a way out for the same, since I would like to continue this topic serially.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!

A K Kaul
