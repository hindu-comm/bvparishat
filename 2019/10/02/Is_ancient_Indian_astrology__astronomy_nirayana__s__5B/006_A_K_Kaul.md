Dear Dr. Madhivanan,

Jai Shri Ram!

I am very late in replying your mail, My apologies!

( The problem actually is that earlier I had the maximum information in pdf etc. forms in my desktop/hard-disk but there are some hiccups (hacking!) with the result that I have to, after jogging my memory left and right, hunt for the same in hard-copies! And, as you know, it is not an easy job!)

\<How come sage Valmiki recorded the birth time of Rama if it was impossible under the sidereal system? Obviously, sage Valmiki did not err in describing a tropical position, as our ancestors used a tropical zodiac. Those who believe in Rama/Ramayana must realize that Rama's horoscope is impossible under the sidereal system. It is our mistake to have followed the sidereal system for so long, but it is understandable as we are in Kali yuga.>

I recall having read quite a few articles of C G Rajan in the Astrological Magazine.

In one of his articles he had tried to prove that the combinationof the exalted sun in Mesha and Moon in Karkata and Punarvasu nakshatra in the horoscope of Bhagwan Ram could be possible only if the horoscope had been prepared from the astronomical work of 15th century BCE viz. the Vedanga Jyotisha! It was a long articleof several pages but I do not remember as to when it was published.

***When did Bhagwan Ram Incarnate?***

In any case, we have as yet absolutely no idea as to when Bhagwan Ram had incarnated actually because of the following reasons:  

1\. Bhagwan Ram is supposed to have Incarnated in the fag end of Tretayuga. And the Tretayuga of Surya Siddhanta (we can call it Maya-Mahasura Tretayuga!) ended 3101+2019=5120 years of Kaliyuga+ 864000 years of Dwapara Yuga = 869120 years back.

As per Aryabhatiya Yuga duration, Bhagwan Ram Incarnated in 5120 years of Kaliyuga plus 1080000 years of Dwaparayuga = 1085120 years back---i.e. more than 20000 yeas prior to Maya-Mahasura "calculations".

2\. Even if we presume that the duration of yugas, whether that of the Surya Siddhanta or even Aryabhatiya is nothing but fantasy of some scholars, we cannot brush away the following shlokas of the Valmiki Ramayana itself:

हत्वा क्रूरं दुरादर्षं देवर्षीणां भयावहम् \| दशवर्षसहस्राणि दशवर्षशतानि च \|\|वत्स्यामि मानुषे लोके पालयन् पृथ्वीं इमां \|\|(1/15/29-30)

Dispatching on the field of battle..the cruel and formidable Ravana........I shall remain on the mortal plane ruling over this globe for eleven thousand years. (Gita Press translation)

Having promised thus before His Incarnation, the same Valmiki Ramayana tells us that He was reminded of His promise by (God of) Death as per Uttarakanda 104/12 in the following words

दशवर्षसहस्राणि दशवर्षशतानि च \| कृत्वा वासस्य नियमं स्वयमेवात्मना पुरा \|\|.....कालोSयं ते नरश्रेष्ठ समीपं उपवर्तितुम्

You had set your mind on having a human form..and you yourself fixed the span of your stay (among the mortals) for ten thousand and ten hundred years formerly.....The span of your stay on earth as human being is complete now and it is time for you to come back to us.

(Pl. see attachments Ramarajya11000yrs.\_1&II)

We also find in the VR 2/2/8 a statement from king Dasharatha

प्राप्य वर्ष सहस्राणि बहुन्यायूंषि जीवतः \| जीर्णस्यास्य शरीरस्य विश्रान्तिमभिरोचये \|

I desire to give rest to this worn out body, which has now run many rounds of a human span of life having attained an age of (sixty) thousands of years...(Gita Press translation)

अनेकवर्ष साहस्रो वृद्धस्त्वमसि पार्थिव\| स रामं युवराजानमभिषिञचस्वपार्थिवं 2/2/21

''You have ruled for many thousands of years and have grown old, O ruler of the earth! Such that you are, (pray) install as Prince regent Sri Rama, who is fit to rule the earth." (Gita Press translation).

***Have the "Vedic astrologers" really read the Valmiki Ramayana?***

The earliest ''year" of Incarnation of Bhagwan Ram that we have as on date is that of Nilesh Oak, who claims the Rama-Ravana-Yuddha to have taken place around 12000 BCE. That means Bhagwan Ram ruled after that for 11000 years i.e. till about 1000 BCE. However, the same Nilesh Oak says that the Mahabharata war took place in 5561 BCE. Thus Rama-Rajya was still going on when the Mahabharata war took place!

Similarly, Dr. P V Vartak was of the view that Bhagwan Ram had Incarnated on December 4, 7323 BCE and the Mahabharata war had taken place on October 16, 5561 BCE (same date as that of Nilesh Oak). Thus since Bhagwan Ram is supposed to have ruled/to rule for 11000 years, that means as per Dr. Vartak Bhagwan Ram is still around and will remain so till about 4000 AD! The Mahabharata war, in the meantime, must have been "leela" of the same Bhagwan Ram, which only Dr. Vartak and his "colleagues" could have ''witnessed"!

Then we have the date of Incarnation of Bhagwan Ram from the late I T Commissioner Pushkar Bhatnagar as January 10, 5114 BCE. So Bhagwan Ram will be around till 6000 AD! Similarly, in case of C G Rajan's date of Bhagwan Ram as 4045 BCE, He will be ruling the globe till about 7000 AD!

Thus you can see it for yourself that none of these scholars seem to have read the Valmiki Ramayana at all, as otherwise they would not have made such a mess of divine Incarnations!

***Are there interpolations in the Valmiki Ramayana aslo?***

And if we presume that the long spans of Rama Rajya and the reign of king Dasharatha etc. are later interpolations, that means the astrological planetary details of Bhagwan Ram and His siblings etc. are also interpolations of much later days!

Same is the case with the Mahabharata!

***Why do the "Vedic astrologers" not calculate the planetary positions of divine Incarnations as per the Surya Siddhanta?***

The million dollar questions is that as there was no modern astronomy prior to Copernicus and Galileo etc. of about 15th century CE, then why do all these scholars calculate the planetary positions of even divine Incarnations or the date of Mahabharata war etc. from the software from JPL/NASA? On the one hand, we claim that we had astronomical works like the Surya Siddhanta which could calculate planetary positions for billions of years in a jiffy, but in the same breath we take refuge behind JPL/NASA for calculating planetary positions of even 12000 BCE!
As on date, NASA/JPL software cannot calculate planetary positions earlier to about 15000 BCE at the earliest and maybe that is why they are putting a limit to divine Incarnations at about 12000 BCE!

***Saptarshi Nadi is just like Brighu Samhita and even Ravana Samhita or even Aruna Samhita and so on!***

Regarding the planetary details in "Saptarshi Nadi" etc., since we did not have Mesha, Vrisha etc. Rashis in India till as late or as early as about 3rd/4th century BCE, Saptarshi Nadi is obviously a much later work, ascribed to "Satarshis", just as some people ascribe Ravana Samhita to "Maha-Pandit" Ravana and Brighu Samhita to Brighu Rishi and Aruna Samhita to Aruna, the charioteer of Surya Bhagwan and so on!

The Saptarshi Nadi must have been a work prepared by some later astrologers assiduously.

***The Hindu calendar needs to be streamlined---the earlier the better!***

The long and short of this mail is that we must concentrate on streamlining the Hindu calendar as early as possible since by celebrating all the festivals and muhurtas on wrong days, we are literally killing our own dharma ourselves!

And as the saying goes

धर्मो रक्षति रक्षितः धर्मो हन्ति हतः \|\|

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!
