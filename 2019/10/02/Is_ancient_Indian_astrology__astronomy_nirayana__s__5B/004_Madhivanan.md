Respected members,

I would like to continue the discussion from the second post of Shri A K Kaul here. It is indeed sad that while the western countries follow the correct timings for makar sankranthi, we in India have been following the wrong system and messed up all the timings of our festivals. Even The Calendar Reform Committee, of which Shri Lahiri was a member, said so in its final recommendation:

"The calculation of solar (saura) months necessary for determining the lunar months of the same name, will start 23°15′ ahead of the vernal equinoctial point. This tallies with the present practice of most almanac-makers.

This recommendation is to be regarded only **as a measure of compromise**, so that we avoid a violent break with the established custom. But it does not make our present seasons in the various months as they were in the days of Varahamihira or Kalidasa. It is hoped that at not a distant date, **further reforms** for locating the lunar and solar festivals in the seasons in which they were originally observed will be adopted.” (emphasis mine)

report of The calendar reform committee, page 7

  

The Committee gave in to the distorted beliefs of the then almanac-makers and astrologers and followed a nirayana calendar for the festivals instead of setting things right then when the opportunity arose. But it left it for us in the "at not a distant date" in future to restore the festivals to how our sages designed it.

  

As already mentioned, Varahamihira wrote these books about 2000 years back, but our culture dates back a long time ago. It is unfortunate that most of the books and scriptures from those periods were lost and are no longer available. Fourtunately, some manuscripts describing the astrological predictions interpreted by our saptarishis are being preserved now in Government Oriental Manuscripts Library, Chennai. This collection called 'Saptarishi Nadi' throws ample light on the system followed way back in the time of our sages.

In one of the horoscopes described (Horoscope 47), the sages place the moon in the zodiac sign Scorpio. The Vimshottari dasa system is based on the position of the moon and its nakshatra. As seen in the verse below, the sages describe the nakshatra and dasa period at birth.

The nakshatra is Vishakha and the remaining dasa period is 13 years and 8 months of Jupiter dasa. This places the Moon in the *1^(st) padam and not in the 4^(th)* of Vishakha. Hence, we see that the sage places Vishakha’s *1^(st) padam* in *Scorpio*!

According to the Sidereal zodiac followed by our astrologers today, vishakha 4th padam is in Scorpio and the first three padams are in Libra. If our sages had used a sidereal zodiac, they would not have described Vishakha 1st padam in Scorpio. If our sages did not follow the sidereal zodiac as defined by our astrologers today, what did they follow? Tropical! This is not the only instance in the manuscript where the sages described a planetary position outside the definitions of Sidereal zodiac.  

  

More examples from the same collection and a detailed discussion on it can be found in my website: <https://madhivanan.in/saptarishis-used-tropical-zodiac/>
