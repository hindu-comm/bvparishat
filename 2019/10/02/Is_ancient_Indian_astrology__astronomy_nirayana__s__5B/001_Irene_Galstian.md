Sir,

  

If possible, could you please add the next mail(s) to this thread, or to another single thread of your choice? I'm compiling your contributions for a personal wiki, and dispersion over many different threads means that some of your teachings can easily be overlooked - by myself, as well as by others.

  

Thank you,

Irene
