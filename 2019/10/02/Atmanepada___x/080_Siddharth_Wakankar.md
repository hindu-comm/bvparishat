In modern India,many English words are used and understood also wrongly,like this word vulgar and the other is romantic or romance.In view of that I made my statement.

  

I very well know the words Vulgate etc.because I am working in the field of Manuscripts since 1977,but,it seems that you are innocent of some typical uses of English words in modern India.

  

Despite that I appreciate your response.

  

I hope,you will understand my viewpoint,which has become a very typical experience in India, of which,you may not be aware.
