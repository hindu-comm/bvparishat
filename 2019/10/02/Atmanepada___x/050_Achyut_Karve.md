Dear Vidwans,

  

Atmanepada roots get atmanepada suffixes. It is clear that the roots are atmanepada. In Sanskrit the roots are classified according to the intonation of the root and the root ending which generates the sense of atmanepada. Thus the roots too are sensuous. They are meaningful. If the roots themselves are meaningful on account of their intonation does it not suggest that they were the calls of early man. Intonation of vowels in speech changes meaning. In fact Chinese languages even today use intonation as a tool to distinguish meaning in homonyms.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
