Dear Rishi Ji,

  

  I have attached a short article by Laura Grestenberger on the relationship of the middle voice and the reflexive pronouns in the language of the Rigveda. Sometimes the Ātmanepada verb and the reflexive pronoun occur together, and Grestenberger calls this double marking of reflexivity.
