Decades ago, I had to introduce a speaker named Swain (from Orissa),

and I referred to his name as a vulgar form of the Sanskrit *svAmin*.

While the speaker did not hear me properly, the organiser was all anger with me  

as I used the word *vulgar*. I told him it stands for the *apabhraMs'a* form,

but could not convince him, as he hardly had the patience or ability to listen and understand.

  

But the etymological sense of *vernacular* is hardly grasped by people:

it refers to "the language of the \[home-born\] slave"!
