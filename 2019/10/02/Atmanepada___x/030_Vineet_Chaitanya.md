Even Hindi does have a device to convey this through auxiliary verb, which can be analysed as a counter part of a verbal-suffix.  

  

 राम ने भोजन पका लिया: This means Rama cooked for himself.  

राम ने भोजन पका दिया: This means Rama cooked for others.

Please note Hindi is not using words equivalent to "himself" or "others".
