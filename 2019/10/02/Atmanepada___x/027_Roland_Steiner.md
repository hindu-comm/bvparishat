\> is this limited to reflexI've verbs (akarmaka Dhatus)  
  

No. Greek loú- ("to wash"), for instance, is a transitive verb: loúei  
"he/she washes somebody or someone". The corresponding middle form is  
loúetai "he/she washes himself/herself, bathes".  

  
  
\> Which was pr0bably translated by Mr Roland as "He washes himself".  
\> "Himself = Se".  
  

No. The middle form loúetai means "he/she washes himself/herself"  
without the need for an additional separate reflexive pronoun (Spanish  
"se", English "himself", Sanskrit ātmānam). The meaning "himself" is  
inhering in the form loúetai.  

  
  
\> So, I'd say this isn't Aatmanepad, what Mr Roland said.  
  

I have given just \*one\* example for illustration, but the middle voice  
in Greek has not only one single function. If you are interested, you  
should take lessons in Ancient Greek.
