Chinese is a tonal language, whereas Vedic Sanskrit was a pitch-accent language, much similar to Ancient Greek. The other Indo-European languages such as Serbo-Croatian and extant Baltic languages such as Lithuanian and Latvian are also considered pitch-accent languages.In tonal languages, each syllable has an inherent pitch contour, whereas in pitch-accent languages the pitch is relative betweenadjacentsyllables, and typically only one syllable has the high pitch. So, Sanskrit has more in common in other Indo-European languages than Chinese.

  

Thanks,
