Namaste



**Some points to ponder over**: (Answers may not be easy, convenient and palpable; yet the 'vaakya- artha- vichaara' must go on ! I am not clear on these issues )



a) If Lepzig researched ' Atmanepada in the Rigveda'; then the design -practical usage of ' Verb declensions' with clarity on Parasmai-atmane- Ubhaya padi's would get a historic anchor to whatever date that may be ascribed to Rigveda. 



 a-1) If this be the case, was Sanskrit the only language of that ' socio-historic context' which had such idiosyncrasies ? Why was it necessary as a part of ' language design' ??

a-2) Nirukta is heavily dependent on the Vyakarana sampradaya;
and holds a strong view that ' dhatu' is the basis for ' other words'. What seems to be take up of Yaska in 

classifying the 'Dhatu's' as atmane and Parasmai - a tag which must take in to account the ' svarita issues' and ' -ngit' issues. Is there any surviving traces of this

tradition? Indigenous 'Vedanga' insider -Research findings? Practical benefits ?



b) Connecting- Comparing to Spanish grammar processing : What is the model by which Samskruth -Spanish language grammar interaction seems to have taken place ?

History routes and contexts please.



c) If 'Atmane and Parasmai' pada have an osmosis in the Vedic and Classical ( Chandas and Bhashaa) frames, What makes Vaidika Dhatu -Swara Prakriyaa a class apart from the bhashaa declension models?



Help appreciated.
