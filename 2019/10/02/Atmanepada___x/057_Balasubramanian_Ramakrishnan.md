While I stay out of these kind of somewhat random statements, I would like to ask Sri Karve the following questions:

  

1\. Given the fact that accents are preserved only in Vedic texts, what Veda(s) have you learned or at least tried to research?

2\. What corresponding sikShA and prAtishAkhyams have you studied and found wanting to describeVedic accentual system?

  

Ramakrishnan
