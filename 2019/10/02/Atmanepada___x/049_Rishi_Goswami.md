धन्यवादाः माधवजी \_/\\\_  
  
I am trying to find Tika online and someone gave me this entire book, on Email. I just saw this message. Thankyou so much for the effort.  
  
I'm trying to find some Sanskrit Tika or even Sankshipt Hindi Tika is fine, I'm having certain difficulty in getting/finding the parallels to technical terms. But yes, it's very helpful.  
  
No problem, i am thinking to buy the entire 5 volume series published through Chokhamba, I've enquired and thinking to buy it if unavailable online.  
  
Namaskara.
