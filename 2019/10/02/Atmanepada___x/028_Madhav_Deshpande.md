Dear Roland,he

  

  This is very helpful. If the middle forms in Greek convey the reflexive meaning without needing a reflexive pronoun, and if we see Ātmanepada forms in the R̥gveda often accompanied by a reflexive pronoun, leading Laura Grestenberger to call this **double marking of reflexivity**, could this be an indication of the gradually weakening of the reflexive significance of the Ātmanepada forms in Vedic and Sanskrit? Obviously, Pāṇini recognizes reflexivity as a meaning for some Ātmanepada usages \[स्वरितञित: कर्त्रभिप्राये क्रियाफले\], but on several rules of Pāṇini, e.g. परिव्यवेभ्य: क्रिय:, the commentary Kāśikāvr̥tti points out that the root क्री listed by Pāṇini as डुक्रीञ् normally will have Ātmanepada endings if it is reflexive \[कर्त्रभिप्राये क्रियाफले सिद्धमात्मनेपदम्\]. Then what is the point of prescribing Ātmanepada for the same root in combinations with prefixes परि, वि, and अव? The commentary says: अकर्त्रभिप्रायार्थोऽयमारम्भ:. As far as the commentary goes, in such cases, we have Ātmanepada in non-reflexive environments. On Pāṇini's rule आङो दोऽनास्यविहरणे again, the commentary saysअकर्त्रभिप्रायार्थोऽयमारम्भ:. The same comment is found on Pāṇini's rules निसमुपविभ्यो ह्व:, स्पर्धायामाङ:, गन्धनावक्षेपण..., अधे: प्रसहने, वे: शब्दकर्मण:, सम्माननोत्सञ्जन..., अकर्मकाच्च, आम्प्रत्ययवत्..., प्रोपाभ्यां युजेरयज्ञपात्रेषु, णेरणौ यत्कर्म..., भीस्म्योर्हेतुभये, गृधिवञ्च्यो: प्रलम्भने, लिय: सम्मानन..., and मिथ्योपपदात्... In so many cases, the Ātmanepada forms are prescribed by Pāṇini in non-reflexive significance. In several cases, where the generic rules would have provided Ātmanepada and reflexive meaning, Pāṇini specifically prescribes Parasmaipada, e.g. अनुपराभ्यां कृञ:.
This shows that reflexivity is not invariably connected with Ātmanepada forms in Pāṇini, but it is still a clearly recognizable significance in a large number of cases. The collective usage shows a great deal of variability already in Pāṇini's rules, and the post-Pāṇinian usage seems to lose this prominent sense of reflexivity of Ātmanepada forms.
