Some examples from Russian:

  

myt' - to wash

myt'sya - to wash oneself; adding 'sya' often turns the actor into the recipient of its own action

  

However:

  

varit' - to cook

varit'sya - to cook oneself, but that's not quite reflexive, it's more passive usage, e.g. when you say 'obed varitsya', which would literally mean 'the dinner is cooking itself', you mean that the dinner is being cooked by someone, even if that someone is you. When you want to say 'Michael is cooking dinner', you'd say 'Michael varit obed'.
