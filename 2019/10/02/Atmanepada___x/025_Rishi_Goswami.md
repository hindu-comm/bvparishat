Dr Shastry, Bijoy ji, other Vidvansah cha.  
  
Reflexive verbs really don't convey the meaning of Aatmanepada in Loka, but as far as Vedas are concerned, I was really shocked to see the use "himself" आत्मानम् in Rigveda. Thank you very much Vidvan Shri Madhavji for the pdf.  
  
I'm learning Spanish for joy so was aware of the Concept only of Spanish. Spanish has Reflexive verbs mostly in only those cases where we use Akarmaka Dhatus in Samskrit, exceptions aside. But, Rigveda is using kri, अञ्जू व्यक्तिम्रक्षणकान्तिगतिषु and such Sakarmaka Dhatus in Reflexive Sense, it's really a new concept to me as such uses are not found in Loka...  
  
I wasn't sure of the translation being 100% accurate so I actually referred to Sayana Bhashya on Rigveda 4.7.11 which I'll post here.  
  
मन्त्र =  
तृ॒षु यदन्ना॑ तृ॒षुणा॑ व॒वक्ष॑ तृ॒षुं दू॒तं कृ॑णुते य॒ह्वो अ॒ग्निः ।  
वात॑स्य मे॒ळिं स॑चते नि॒जूर्व॑न्ना॒शुं न वा॑जयते हि॒न्वे अर्वा॑ ।।११।।  
  
भाष्य = “यत् यः अग्निः “तृषु क्षिप्रमेव "अन्ना अन्नानि काष्ठादीनि “तृषुणा क्षिप्रेण रश्मिसमूहेन “ववक्ष वहति । दहतीत्यर्थः । “यह्वः महान् सः “अग्निः “तृषुम् आत्मानं “दूतं “कृणुते यजमानदूतं करोति।  
  
लौकिकवाक्यार्थः (अहम् अलिखम्) =  
  
यो अग्निः काष्ठादीनि रश्मिसमूहेन क्षिप्रं दहति, स महान् अग्निः आत्मानं यजमानदूतं कुरुते।  
  
Here this आत्मानम् meaning in कुरुते was clearly missing and how did this concept of "aatmanam" arrive? Only solution is Aatmanepad perhaps. Even English translation is in Consensus.  
  
"The mighty Agni makes himself the messanger of the worshipper."  
  
Which basically means "Agni becomes the Yajamana-Doota."  
  
\_\_\_\_\_\_  
  
And In Spanish would also say the same thing  
"Agni se Hace el mesenger"  
  
"Agni makes himself the messenger" is one way of  
saying it when "se" is used as a Reflexive Pronoun, the same "se" is used for Passive Voice कर्मवाच्य and also for कर्मकर्तृ - I'm amaware of what it's called in English.  
  
Tu voz se suena bien.  
तव वाक् श्रूयते (se suena) सम्यक्(bien)।

1 part of the Question is solved. Does Sanskrit use Aatmanepad in Reflexive Sense? To convey आत्मानम् भूषयति = अङ्क्ते। आत्मानं दूतं कुरुते (दूतो भवति) = कृणुते।  
This आत्मानम् sense is Reflexive, yes.  
Here, I've only read a few lines. I will read more and come soon, to find the answer to this question:  
  
The question that remains is, does any other language use Aatmanepada or Parasmaipada as 2 different forms, other than Reflexive Forms? Without the meaining of "आत्मानम्"?  
  
With the explanation of देवदत्तः पचते = देवदत्तः स्वभोजनार्थंं पचति and not देवदत्तः आत्मानं पचति।। If Aatmanepad was Reflexive here, the Verb would directly Reflect on the Karta as I stated above..  
देवदत्तः पच्यते or देवदत्तः आत्मानं पचते would be the Artha..  
  
So Aatmanepad can't be Reflective everywhere. But I'll be back soon after reading it thoroughly. If there's something I'm misunderstanding.
