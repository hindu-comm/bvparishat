In linguistics, "vulgar" (> Latin vulgaris "common") has the special  
meaning "vernacular" (Merriam-Webster: "1a: using a language or  
dialect native to a region or country rather than a literary,  
cultured, or foreign language; b: of, relating to, or being a  
nonstandard language or dialect of a place, region, or country; c: of,  
relating to, or being the normal spoken form of a language"). In these  
contexts, "vulgar" does \*not\* mean "lacking in cultivation,  
perception, or taste" or "morally crude, undeveloped, or  
unregenerate". In a nutshell, "Vulgar Latin" is the spoken form of  
non-Classical Latin from which originated the Romance group of  
languages.  
  
A commonly accepted text or reading is called "vulgate". For example,  
the term "The Vulgate" designates the Latin version of the Bible (made  
by the 4th century) authorized and used by the Roman Catholic Church.  
Nothing negative resonates in it, quite the opposite ("commonly  
accepted"), as one can imagine.  
  
To give an Indian example: The print version (1911; with minor  
alterations 1918 and 1937) of the so-called Yogavāsiṣṭha (based only  
on very few manuscripts) has become the received text, which is why it  
can also be called a sort of vulgate version.
