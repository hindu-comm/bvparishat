The semantic distinction between Parasmai and Atmane is long extinct.

And the distinction has had its parallels in other languages.

  

The less the number of languages one is exposed to,  

the more the generalisations one tends to draw, or at least more easily,

and perhaps the more vehemently one argues.

  

A friend of mine argued for the greatness of Sanskrit simply on the ground that Sanskrit has 7 Cases,

whereas English has less. So also Sanskrit has duals, he argued,  

which others - like Kannada, Hindi, or Tamil - do not have.

  

I told him that there are languages that have dual forms too.  

And further that Finnish has 15, and Hungarian has 18 Cases.

There may be languages with more.  

So?
