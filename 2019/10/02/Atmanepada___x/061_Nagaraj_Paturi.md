Sri Achyut-ji,

  

When you are able to see that you are entering terrains where there is already great scholarship developed, please don't attempt to be a theorizer without learning the existing body of knowledge. You are trying to push the borders of the fields which you have no clue to.

  

It does not hurt to express a learner's attitude, when we are at that stage.

  

I have the responsibility to avert members from getting irritated from such posts.
