Dear Vidwans,

  

My question is very specific. Are there languages in the world where verbs or their roots are classified into two groups like Atmanepada and Parasmaipada and whether they can be recognised with the help of the suffixes they take on in usage?

  

Kindly help me in answering the above question.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
