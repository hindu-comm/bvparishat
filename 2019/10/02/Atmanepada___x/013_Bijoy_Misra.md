Achyutji,

I have not gone that far, but वाक्यपदीय could possibly give an analytic explanation.

The realization of the merger of the subject and object could be the key.

If we think that the language is a cognitive concept, then we have to dig into the

indigenous languages for the trace of "self", who dies, who is born etc.

Though difficult, it would be a fascinating to research.

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
