Dear Rishi Ji,

  

  I cannot answer your questions about Greek in any details, as I do not have primary expertise in Greek. As for reciting/singing the scriptures etc., there are established traditions of reciting the Koran, and the Jewish, the Jain and the Buddhist scriptures. I have read that there are traditionally established ways of reciting the Biblical texts in their original languages and in Latin. Each language in the world has its own distinct sound system etc, and not having the sounds of Sanskrit is not their deficiency. Sanskrit does not have the sounds of English or German or Chinese. Each language is an internally complete system for its users. What distinguishes Sanskrit from other languages is that a formal analysis of this language and the formation of a grammar was done already in ancient times. But a language is not the same as a grammar. Each language has built in systematicity shared by its speakers, and when that systematicity is analytically understood and formalized, we call it a grammar. The existence of an explicitly formalized grammar like that of Pāṇini is not a feature of the language itself, but of the scholastic tradition that emerged in ancient India.
