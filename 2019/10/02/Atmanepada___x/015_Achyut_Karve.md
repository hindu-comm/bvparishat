Dear Vidwans,

  

Sanskrit is as natural a language as any otherlanguage. What is the the difference? The difference lies in the way a classical dancer would dance as against the dance of an uninitiated dancer. It is for this reason that great importance is give to Shiksha before learning Sanskrit.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
