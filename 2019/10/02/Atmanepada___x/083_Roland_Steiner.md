First, it's messages to the list, not to single individuals, right? No  
one is accused of ignorance, but not everyone knows the spectrum of  
meaning of "vulgar" or the meaning of "Vulgate". Second, I am still of  
the opinion that it is not necessary to rebuke Rishi Goswami if one  
understands his statement correctly. That's all I have to say.  
  
Best,
