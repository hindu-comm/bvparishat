Firstof all there is no proof that there were a large number of shaDA\~Nga schools ever. Patañjali himself has a comment on how in the “old days” people studied grammar but now they don’t etc., etc.

  

In any case, where is the question of the sikShAs failing us? Did they fail or people failed to study them? This whole thing is getting beyond silly.

  

Again I ask, what Veda was studied along with it’s shikshA text and found wanting? I am not saying shikShas have the answers to all questions, but claiming that they have failed in the area of accent is just beyond all silliness possible.
