I was kept wondering why Prof BVKSastry has not rushed to the defence of Karve-ji yet.

The two seem to form a clique as it were.

  

Let Karve-ji write any nonsense, BVK is there to write a disquisition  

to discover merits in Karve-ji's statements.

Dear BVK, what ails Karve-ji is his essential attitude.

The typos are not a big thing; his stubborn stand that BVP stands to gain

by giving a voice to donkeys (by his own (com)passionate confession, nay, conviction).

  

There is not a syllable that can be called irrelevant or irreverent in what Prof. Paturi said  

of Karve-ji's non-intermittent impertinence.

It will do a lot of good to Karve-ji to read the comment of Prof. Paturi daily

as soon as he gets up from bed, and before he goes to sleep, dwell and contemplate on it.

(I was actually a bit angry with Paturi-ji for being silent for so too long.

Ought obduracy be brooked for this long? Prof. Paturi has anyway given a long rope patiently,

and shown Karve-ji his place, and as a constructive measure, furnished  

a decent corrective to his attitude which is the crux of the issue).

  

The forum is indeed, as far as I know, for asking academic questions and academic answers.

To betray asinine nonchalancy on the one hand - not to catch even a glimpse of  

the scholarship already developed in the field (as Prof. Paturi pointedly and pertinently drew attention to),  

and yet display superciliousness on the other, are not very becoming of an academic scholar.

  

I am reminded of a quote. It will do well to ask ourselves now and then  

which of the four groups we belong to :

There are four kinds of people -  

He who knows not and knows not he knows not, he is a fool : shun him.

He who knows not and knows he knows not, he is simple : teach him.  

He who knows and knows not he knows, he is asleep : wake him.  

He who knows and knows he knows, he is wise : follow him.
