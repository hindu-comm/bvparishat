The words such as 'vulgar' were used when old fashioned value-loaded terms were being used in reference to languages, social groups etc.

  

Today, it is not right to call any language 'vulgar'.

  

Particularly when a paamara dialect of an older time grows into a language of its own and develops its own s'ishTa and praakrita versions, it no longer remains 'vulgar'.

  

Spanish is an independent language today. It has its own elite and non-elite dialects.
