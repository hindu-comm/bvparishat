Dear Vidwans,

  

Intonation being a very basic sound unit of sense does it not mean that Sanskrit has more in common with Chinese than with European Languages.

  

Radhakrishnaji would be in a position to throw more light on the aspect of role of intonation in Mandarin.

  

Patanjali too in his Pashpanhik has stressed the importance of intonation in language.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
