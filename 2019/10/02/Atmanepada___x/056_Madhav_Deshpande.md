Thanks, Suresh, for pointing out the relative character of syllable accent in Sanskrit. Also there is a distinction between derivational accent of a word and the prosodic accent in the context of a sentence.
For example, *bódhati* and *tudáti*, have different accent pattern derivationally, but if they come after a non-verb \[Pāṇini's rule 8.1.16: *tiṅ atiṅaḥ*\] in a sentence, they both lose their udātta accent. They keep their udātta if they occur in a relative clause etc.
Similarly, the forms *naúmi, nuváḥ, numáḥ* have the udātta accent on different syllables derivationally, however, they will lose their udātta completely if they occur after a non-verb, but will keep it if they occur in a relative clause etc. The derivational accent of Sanskrit largely corresponds with Greek cognates. I am not familiar with what happens to prosodic accent in Greek sentences. This is very different from what happens in a language like Chinese. With best wishes,
