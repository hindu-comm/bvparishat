Sorry for using that word. A better word can be used as refering to an experience of the language that seems melodious romantic and grameena.

  

Languages have their own flavour attached to it, which every(i think many) person who hears it will **probably** have the same thing to say (maybe not sometimes). Reason why people who first time listen to Telugu or Bengali find them sweet, or ones who listen to Urdu find it courteous.

Similarly, when I heard Spanish for the first time, I found it very sweet, romantic and grameena/dehati in nature.

Probably many people had the same experience as mine, hence identify it as a **"romance language."**
