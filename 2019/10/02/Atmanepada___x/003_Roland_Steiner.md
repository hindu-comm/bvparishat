\> Are there languages in the world where verbs or their roots are  
\> classified into two groups like Atmanepada and  
\> Parasmaipada and whether they can be recognised with the help of the  
\> suffixes they take on in usage?  
  

Ancient Greek, for instance. Greek Verbs have three voices (active,  
middle, and passive).  
  
λού-ω (loú-ō) "I wash" (active ≈ paraismapada)  
λού-ο-μαι (loú-o-mai) "I wash myself" (middle ≈ ātmanepada)
