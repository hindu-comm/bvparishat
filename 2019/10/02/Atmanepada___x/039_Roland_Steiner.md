Dear Prof. Deshpande,  
  
Thank you very much for your most interesting remarks. Unfortunately,  
I'm neither a comparative linguist nor a greek scholar (I learned  
ancient Greek in high school almost 40 years ago), which is why I  
cannot competently discuss your question ("could this be an indication  

of the gradually weakening of the reflexive significance of the  

Ä€tmanepada forms in Vedic and Sanskrit"). In order to avoid possible  
misunderstandings, I should add, however, that also ancient Greek  
makes use of reflexive pronouns, also in connection with middle verb  
forms (cp. Laura Gerstenberger's "double marking of reflexivity").  
  
Best wishes,  
  
Roland
