Dear Dr. BVK,

You don't need to follow VP, but be a good experimenter.

I want to know the foundations that made VP possible.

The statements like he has some view are peripheral.

He is the only scientist of sound if we can coin such a phrase.

Raman tried in his late stage from the drums. Human voice is

a marvel of nature. Language is artificial.  

Sorry I am digressing. I stop here.

BM

  

PS. Anyone serious and has strong analytic background may contact

me off line. Basic cosmology and neurology would be required.
