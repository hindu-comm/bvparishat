Dear Vidwan,

  

So it appears that no other language in the has atmanepada and parasmaipad classification in order that they take different suffixes.

  

The following is my submission:

  

So none of the natural languages have differentiated the self (atmane) differently as an object as is in the case of Sanskrit. Why? just because Sanskrit is not a natural language. It is a language that has evolved with a purpose different than those through which natural languages evolved. Natural languages evolved as a means of communication within society whilst Sanskrit evolved as a means of knowledge and its transfer from generation. It evolved as an art form.

  

The design of the Atmanepada roots and their suffixes show that the self itself can become the subject of investigation which is amply recorded in the Vedanta texts.

  

Marx said that man started differentiating himself from animals when he started to produce his own means of subsistance. This stage in man's evolution is recognized as homo sapiens sapiens. However the atmanepada roots and the suffixes indicate a further step in the evolution of man.
A step that recoginizes man himself to be the object of an act.
(आत्मोधार) This stage of man therefore needs to be called homo sapiens sapiens sapiens.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
