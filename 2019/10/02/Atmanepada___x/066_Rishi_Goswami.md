Namaskara Shree-Madhavji \_/\\\_,

I have understood alot in Upagraha Samuddesha, as a found a Sankshipt Sanskrit Tika as well as a Gujarati Tika. Thankyou very much Nagraj Mahodaya for suggesting it.

Sureshji \_/\\\_, Madhavji\_/\\\_, Thank you for giving information about pitch-accent languages and tonal languages.

I had no idea Udattadi swaras may also exist in some other language other than Sanskrit. But, was the Ancient Vedic Sanskrit ever part of speech? Or only a means of ritualistic rote and sacrifice?  
How could someone possibly speak the language with so many complications of where to add which Swara? Even if a man did speak it, it would mean he constantly Sang the language.

Also, did Ancient Greek also have this Vaidik Laukik classification? I haven't heard of any ritualistic book, or any Pramana Shastra for the Greeks. Iliad and Odyssey are the only 2 works I know of. If Udattadi Swaras existed in other languages, probably they too had some Sung Version of a scripture they used for worshiping their Gods. Possibly to my assumption, such a language couldn't be spoken on a daily basis.

Another question which was raised in this thread was some unique feature only Sanskrit has. I think it is the PanchaVargi of Sanskrit. There maybe no language having all 5 Vargas, all 5 types of pronounciations, along with Alpaprana and Mahaprana, and all 5 Anunasikas.

Latin languages lack any Mahaprana Uccharanas, except of the Aghosha Hakara (like in Junto), they also have no Tavarga (moordhanya). English Tavarga doesn't have the Mahapranas, and the Anunasika.

  
Also, possibly the usage of Ayogavahas (Preferably Visarga), but here I can be wrong.

Pranamami.
