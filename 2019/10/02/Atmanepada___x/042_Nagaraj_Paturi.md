Yes, Dr Steiner. Just before your message below arrived here, I downloaded part 1 from Archive. org.

  

It is English translation without the Sanskrit verses, upto the 7th, Saadhana Samuddes'a.

  

Probably part 2 has the remaining, so Upagraha also.

  

So Sri Achyut-ji needs part 2.

  

Thanks and regards,

  

Nagaraj
