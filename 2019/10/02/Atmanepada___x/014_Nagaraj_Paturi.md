Sanskrit is a natural language. Nothing artistically or as some orientalist believed and still believe, liturgically created in it.

  

No romanticization of the 'greatness' of that language is required.

  

It's beauty or divinity or refinement is in the Dharma inherent in it, that got coded in it through the use of it by the s'ishTas that were epitomes of Dharma. At least, that is what Hari avers in VP.

  

Hari deals with the issue of aatmanepada synchronically / descriptively in padakaaNDa. Does not answer the evolutionist diachronic questions of Sri Achyut-ji.
