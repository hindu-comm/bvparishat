Sir,

  

Prof. Dr.George Cardona will be in a better position to comment on the Spanish Language,as it is his mother.tongue. He could be contacted or consulted in this regard.

  

One thing is rightly pointed out by Prof.Paturi.

  

The use of the word vulgar is outdated and should not be used anymore in modern parlance.  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
