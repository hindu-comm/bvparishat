Dear Vidvans.  
  
I am in consensus with Karve Mahoday.  
  
Because, the example that Mr Roland has given, I would like to ask is this limited to reflexI've verbs (akarmaka Dhatus) or to all the verbs? Wash seems like स्ना शौचे and Spanish has similar usages..  
  
To denote that the क्रियाफल (termination/result of action) will go to the Subject, we use a special word call "se" that denotes the अकर्मकत्व of the Action.  
Take for example.  
स्ना शौचे is called banyar (बाञार्) in Spanish.  
Devadatta se banya.  
Means देवदत्तः स्नाति (स्वयमेव)।।  
The "se" just denotes the fruit of bathing will go to Devadatta.  
  
Which was pr0bably translated by Mr Roland as "He washes himself".  
"Himself = Se".  
  
Another example will make it clear.  
  
मृ प्राणत्यागे is another example.  
If someone dies, there can't be any object hence the result or fruit of dying is gone to the Subject.  
Here, despite of कर्तृगामिनि क्रियाफले there is no कर्मसंभावना and the क्रियाफल is differently defined here, I will check the Tika and respond soon.  
  
Example  
Devadatta Se Muere. देवदत्तः म्रियते।  
Yo Me Muero. अहं म्रिये।  
"se" and "me" are reflexive pronouns that denote the verb is going to the subject.  
  
अहम् स्वत एव म्रिये।  
देवदत्तः स्वत एव म्रियते। इति तात्पर्यम्।  
  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
  
But the catch is Aatmanepad does not mean what your purpose is Mr Roland.  
  
The क्रियाफल is in a different context here. I will give you an example.  
देवदत्तः पचति means Devdatta is cooking, but not for himself. He is cooking probably as a servant and the food will be eaten by यज्ञदत्त Yajnadatta.  
क्रियाफल doesnt mean धात्वर्थ here but in a more practical sense.  
  
देवदत्तः पचते (Devadatta is cooking). Again here Aatmanepad is used to denote that Devadatta is cooking for himself, not for Yajnadatta or someone else. Devadatta will eat the food himself.  
  
Another example is of a Yajna. In a Yajna, the Yajamana is the one who pays the Brahmana for the Yajna. The fruit of the Yajna doesn't go to the Hota (Pandit) but the Yajamana (the fee giver). Keeping that in mind,  
  
देवदत्तः यजति means Devadatta sacrificies, not for himself but for Yajamana.  
देवदत्तः यजते means Devadatta sacrificies but only for himself, for his Nityakarma, not for any Yajamana. So Yajnaphala is going to Devadatta only.  
  
In धात्वर्थ case, क्रियाफल in first example,be it परस्मै or आत्मने, will never go to Devadatta, but only to the food being cooked. Because पाकफल is विक्लित्ति which will only be in the Rice.  
In the second example too, क्रियाफल will go to the याग, never to Devadatta, nor the Yajamana.  
  
The Spanish equivalents to the 2 things, maybe  
1. Devadatta Cocina.  
(If at all I did "se" here, it becomes = Devadatta Se Cocina = Devadatta is Cookked. Literally Se denotes Devadatta being the Locus of Paak/Viklitti/Kriyaphala).  
  
2. Devadatta Sacrifica.  
(If at all we add 'se' = Devadatta Se Sacrifica.  
Devadatta is Sacrificied.  
Literally will imply that He sacrificied himself, for क्रियाफल is now not going to हविः but to Devadatta.)  
  
So, I'd say this isn't Aatmanepad, what Mr Roland said.  
  
\_\_\_\_\_  
  
So, now on understanding these examples, what is left to understand if any other Roots, other than Reflixive, are been used in this sense which I stated. Maybe Mr Roland may have ggotten mislead by the terminology being same = Kriyaphala.  
  
Namaskara..
