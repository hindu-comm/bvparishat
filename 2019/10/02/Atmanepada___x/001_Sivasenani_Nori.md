This is called middle voice in English. A number of languages have it. For instance: French, Swedish, Icelandic. In French, it is called the voix moyenne.  
  
And apparently the are languages with more voices than active (subject of verb is agent), passive (subject of verb is the object of action, or patient, to use an antiquated term) and middle (subject of verb is both agent and patient).
