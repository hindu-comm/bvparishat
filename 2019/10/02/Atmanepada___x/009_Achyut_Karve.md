Dear Roland,

  

I am saying that in Sanskrit Atmanepadi verb roots have different pratyayas than Parasmaipada verb roots. Did Greek have them. Today too we use verbs which are reflexive. Such verbs are found in all languages.

  

Thus we can say that the theory of Indo European Languages is a self serving bogey. Sanskrit is a language the purpose of which is different from that of other languages. It was not naturally born out of social need.

  

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
