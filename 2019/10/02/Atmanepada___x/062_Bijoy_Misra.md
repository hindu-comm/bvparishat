Madhavji,

We have to distinguish between individual sounds and sounds in an ensemble.

In the second situation it would be more of compounding (sandhi). VP analyzes this

from the basics in the 3.3 sections that were brought up before. I love 3.3.32

from the cosmology point of view.

Regards,

Bijoy
