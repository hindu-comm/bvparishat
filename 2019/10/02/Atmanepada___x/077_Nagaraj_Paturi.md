\> In linguistics, "vulgar" (> Latin vulgaris "common") has the special  
meaning "vernacular" (Merriam-Webster: "1a: using a language or  
dialect native to a region or country rather than a literary,  
cultured, or foreign language; b: of, relating to, or being a  
nonstandard language or dialect of a place, region, or country; c: of,  
relating to, or being the normal spoken form of a language").

  

Which Linguistics?

  

Merriam Webster is not a Dictionary of Linguistic terms.

  

<https://www.academia.edu/23349059/A_Dictionary_of_Linguistics_and_Phonetics_David_Crystal>

  

is an example of a Dictionary of Linguistic terms.

  

I didn't find the term 'vulgar' in that.  

  

\> In a nutshell, "Vulgar Latin" is the spoken form of

non-Classical Latin from which originated the Romance group of  
languages.

  

" Vulgar Latin" was the term once used in reference to non-Classical Latin which was once used.

  

Non-Classical Latin was a dialect of Latin.

  

We are talking of the suitability of the term in reference to a contemporary language, not a dialect.
