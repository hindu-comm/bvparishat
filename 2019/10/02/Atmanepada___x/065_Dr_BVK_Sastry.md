Namaste Misra ji





There are several connected strands and suggestions in your guidance below.



1. I agree on the following points:



1a) शिक्षा is not failing anyone. It is there to help how to recite the Vedas.. ( This guidance is not being used is a sad part for Veda education teams; and veda-analysts team. Voice can come only from a living being; not from reading the scripted text.)

1b) VP's edifice is built on the fuller knowledge and practice of Six Vedangas and then leading to the pinnacle of Vedanta - Shabda Brahma. In the process, there are many fall out studies and guidance useful for several disciplines, including the Consciousness studies, Semantics, Brain-basis of Meaning et al. ( The present VP debaters seem to have missed the base and basics of Shadanga Vedanga structure on which Vedanta of Sphota-Shabda -Brahma is provided in three Kandas.. This statement seems to hurt some; but one needs to stand by reality check. I don't claim i have total knowledge of VP).

1c) The study of sound as a cosmological phenomenon needs to explore 'Panchamahabhoota - Aaksaha - Shabda Guna/Tanmaatra' techniclaities. Modern science is yet to get a handle on these paradigm shifts.



1d) How speech becomes meaningful in ' Living Persons communication model is well studied. But the neurological content and context needs a separate handshake between Vyakarana and Life sciences . This dialogue is not yet at the critical level, as I see in the exchanges at other groups totally focused on this.





2. My submission on the area we need to work more is this. ( I will write an off line mail on this part in about three days to you: Neuro-Physical Basis of Consciousness, How deep Nirukta has pointed to the semantics... et al. There is a specific goal and public benefit for this study, to make traditional texts and perspectives relevant for
today's technologies. Well that is not for public forum debate).:



While we do want to work together, if the small team gets frittered away by sarcasm on frivolous issues of typos and personal attack on credentials, it hurts. who will be left to work ? Let us recognize the quest, question and seek the answers as relevant to our context and deliver a public benefit.



I am always open and willing to be a member of such teams.
