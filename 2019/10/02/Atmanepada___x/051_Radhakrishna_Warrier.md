"*In fact Chinese languages even today use intonation as a tool to distinguish meaning in homonyms*."

  

In one of my previous companies a Chinese colleague used to hold Mandarin classes during lunch hour for those interested in learning the language. I used to attend those classes. I was never able to master the four tones of Mandarin. He would patiently explain to me the difference, but I was not able to reproduce these tonal differences.
Sometimes I even did not hear the difference at all. One example he would often quote is the word ma. Mǎ (馬 horse, pronunciation: <https://0.tqn.com/z/g/mandarin/library/audio/tones/3.mp3> ) is very different from mā (媽 mother, pronunciation <https://0.tqn.com/z/g/mandarin/library/audio/tones/1.mp3>) according to him. But I was not able to reproduce the difference between these two to his satisfaction.

  

Regards,

Radhakrishna Warrier
