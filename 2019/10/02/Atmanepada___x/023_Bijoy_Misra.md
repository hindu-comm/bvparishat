Very interesting that Indo-European language head has no Indo part!

  

I would think that the concepts of Atmanepadi would be a bit different in neurological "natural expression" sense.

Reflexive may not be an appropriate translation. "I have pain", "I feel pain" and "I am pained" are three different constructs.

  

I am away for several days.
