You need not find a dictionary of Linguistic terms for me. I myself am a teacher of Linguistics and I know my terms. I mentioned a dictionary of terms just as a suitable source to consult and bring home the point of technical terms since you mentioned the name of an academic discipline.

  

As you are able to see from his response below you were responding to a highly learned senior scholar Prof. Wakankar who need not be taught words such as Vulgate, their etymology, origin etc.

  

Sri Rishi Goswami realized the anouchitya of using the term vulgar in reference to a contemporary language. That's all.
