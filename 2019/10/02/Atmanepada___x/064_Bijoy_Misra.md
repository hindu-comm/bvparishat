Dear Dr BVK,

We are going towards further digression. शिक्षा is not failing anyone.
It is there to help how to recite the Vedas.

But that is not where the causation of a word is. To dismiss VP as vedānta etc is avoiding the science

of sound that he so profoundly analyzes. As i said before a sound is cosmological, it exists before we

connect it to any meaning. I would request all interested researchers in this group, both young and old, to look  

to discover the resources that might have gone to prepare the VP logic.
If people have deep interest and strongly

analytic in their approach they must study VP in the original (not the translation) just five stanzas per day to understand

the thrust in our regular speech.  

How a sound becomes meaningful is neurological in content. No work is done yet. It is a bit difficult, but we

must try. People may contact me if you have strong interest and good training in analysis. Arbitrary casual

statements are not useful. We are now studying the causation of vowels (not Panianian, but स्वर, through voice)  

Best regards,  

Bijoy Misra
