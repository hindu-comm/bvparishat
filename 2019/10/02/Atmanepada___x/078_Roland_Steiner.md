You certainly don't expect me to find you a dictionary of linguistic  
terms in which the term "vulgar" is defined. The starting point was  
the following statement of Rishi Goswami: "that it \[= Spanish\] was one  
of the Vulgar languages of Latin." What he clearly meant was that  
Spanish evolved from several regional variants of Vulgar Latin in  
Iberia. "Vulgar Latin" does not mean "rude" or "obscene" Latin, but  
"nonclassical Latin", to put it simply. Merriam-Webster reflects this  
usage of "vulgar". That's all.
