Namaste



This is an interesting thread.



In one perspective, I stand by the statement of 'Achyut Karve' on \< "The Shikshas seem to have failed us." 



I also stand by Prof. Paturi's statement in another perspective. What we have is the scripted text, region specific voiced 'Veda' put in to practice in the rituals and worship models. This is highly respected, critical to preserve. There is no second opinion on this. 



To ask a question, Karve does not have to be a profound scholar of all aspects of Samskruth linguistics. He has his expertise in other disciplines, which is not a point for debate here.



Many times, Truth hurts the pride. ***The real question is*** : IF there is even one single school teaching 'Saanga-Shadanga -Veda-adhyayana' in India with a track record of at least a fifty years, India or abroad, please help me to reach them out.' Please dont give me a hear say and point to mathas and ashrams. I have made my decent survey on this issue for the past thirty years. I would be much obliged and grateful to all of you for existence of 'Sanga-Shadanga Veda-adhyana school'.



To my limited exploration made so far, the tradition alluded to in
Vedanga 'Nirukta' for 'adheetya vedam na vijaanati yo-artham' went underground some centuries ago even in India; the upper limit is around fifteenth century. The post colonial 'historic veda' dismantled the vedanga 'Voice training part of Shikshaa from Vedic studies'; The societies demand to have ' veda-professionals' ( and not Veda-artha-shaastra -pundits) as purohits, archakas, aagamikas, jyotishi's reduced veda from a 'Moksha-Jnana sadhana state' to 'Bless you for prosperity, sin freedom, god-pleasing' model professions and training for livelihood. The contribution of ' Vedanta- by lanes and abuses' is also a significant factor in this down fall.



Where in tradition, which acharya has endorsed that 'one gets a pre-qualification to Vedanta, without the pre-requisites of Veda, Samskara and Yoga'? The great compassion of Acharya Ramanuja and Madhva has been drawn to a wrong social track of ' Judeo Christian God- Theology model' of ' punishing-pardoning God through praise and service approach'. It is due to these, we have problem in understanding the ' VEDA TEXT and LANGUAGE', which starts with Shikshaa before Vyakarana and Nirukta.



If there is a failure to understand SHIKSHAA, there is bound to be a serious failure to understand Vyakarana and Nirukta. These warnings are clear in every text of tradition, to which blind eye is turned.



When Achyut Karve asks a question on 'Atmane pada' related to 'Accent (Swara), how will one take to Vyakarana, before addressing the 'Shikshaa' part on 'How to articulate the given Prakruti, Pratipadika, Dhatu, Pratyaya, Prakriyaa and Prayoga'? Instead of addressing this key issue, why find fault on the 'language expression and typos' ? Do we have answers for these questions in the traditional studies/ texts as of now? in theory or practice ? VP is more on Vedanta part of 'Shabda-Brahma vivaarta'. There must be someplace where the pada- swara- part of dhatu -prakriyaa gets connected to ' Chitta -Vrutti- Vivakshaa'. This is NOT what the question is pointing to. Given the 'Gana-patha, given the classification as atmane, parsmai... how is this to be decided in relation to the swaras', which come from Shikshaa ? It is more on connection and continuity of Shikshaa and Vyakarana tradition. If we have texts giving right directions for this, let us explore it. Otherwise, let us seek. 



I was just reminded of a smart quote , to end this response on a lighter mode. There are three sides to every story : Your story, My story, And the True story. In this case, what may resolve the atmane- parsami pada story is how 'Classical texts of Nirukta and Vyakarana have resolved this issue through the 'Shikshaa'? which answers why 'swara' marker for Atmane- parsmai prakriyaa' beyond the ' action benefit ( kriyaa-phala gaamitva'? If swara technicality is for ' process of grammar, then what is the root-logic ? '.



It is neither Karve's story or what we think is already said in some research publication. It is what 'shaastra-kaara has said in the original, in their language and context'.
