नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

का काली ? काकाली का मधुरा ? कामधुरा ।

कं बलवम्तं न बाधते शीतम् ? कंबलवन्तं न बाधते शीतम् ॥

  

(कामधुरा इत्यत्र श्त्री / युवतिः इति विशेष्यम् अध्याहार्यम्)

  

In Telugu -- एद्दीशुनकु अश्वंबगु ? एद्दीशुनकश्वंबगु ( which is the vehicle of शिव ? Ox is the vehicle of शिव ।

  

एद्दि+ ईशुनकु -- एद्दु+ ईशुनकु --- एद्दीशुनकु । अश्व इति औपचारिकः प्रयोगः -- वाहनमित्यर्थः ।

  

Something - may be interesting -----

  

Hari in **वाक्यपदीयम् (वाक्यकाण्डः - 173 )** -- says the following --

  

अन्यथा च समाख्यानम् अवस्थाभेददर्शिभिः ।

क्रियते किंशुकादीनाम् एकदेशावधारणात् ॥

  

Words are interpreted following different situations - some people are exhibiting derivation of some words like

किंशुक etc by separating a part of a sentence / question --

  

किंशुक means पलाश (a tree) -- how this word has come into existence --

  

parrots are not resting on पलाश as there are no fruits -- someone put a question -- किं शुकेन पलाशे ? (why parrotwill be there on a पलाश ?)
or किं शुको न पलाशे ? ( why parrot is not here on a पलाश् ?) -- taking the part of the question

किंशुक -- someone exhibited the व्युत्पत्ति of the word किंशुक as the cause of usage of the word as a synonym of

पलाश ( पालाशदण्ड is held on the shoulder while performing अग्निकार्यम् by a ब्रह्मचारी )

।

So as a result in a sentence like - किंशुके शुकः शेते ( parrot is sleeping on a पलाश tree ) -- the word किंशुक , having

pushed the व्युत्पत्ति into background , simply means पलाश ।

  

' Kangaroo ' is such a word -- some tourists went to Australia and having noticed the animal inquired with some local,

who does not understand English , as to what is the name of that animal -- then he asked - ' kangaroo ' (what do

you mean ? or something like that -- then the tourists took the word as an answer to their question .

  

धन्यो’स्मि
