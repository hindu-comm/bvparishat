NamonamaH,

  

प्रश्नोत्तराभिन्नश्लोक is a type of prahelikaa in which the question itself contains the answer. I came to know about this from the book, Sons of Sarasvati, where it is said that Sosale Garalapuri Sastri was once asked to produce a प्रश्नोत्तराभिन्नश्लोक or pada and he came up with प्रमदोरसिकश्शेते which contains both the question and its answer i.e. प्रमदोरसि कः शेते? प्रमदः रसिकः शेते।  
  
I request scholars to share more such verses or padas.  

  

regards  
shankara
