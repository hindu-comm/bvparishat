This reminds me of an old Tamil verse where the parrot's beak is compared to the coral (havaLa ಹವಳ in Kannada):

  

pavazhakkaara theruvile pavazham kaaNavillaiyaam, evar eDutthuc chendranaro, eDutthaduNDo thatthammaa?

  

The poet wonders: (There is a street where pavazham is sold, it is called  pavazhakkaara theru). There it seems a pavazham is missing. The poet poses a question to the parrot: did you steal it? (thatthammaa = parrot, kiLi).

  

regards
