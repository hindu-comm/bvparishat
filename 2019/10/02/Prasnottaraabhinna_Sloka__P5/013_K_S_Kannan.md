But reverting to the original question raised by Sri Shankara,

the origin of these lies in the Vedic literature itself.

There is a dialogue in the Brahmana literature which amounts to saying:

 You asked me verily, "Who art thou?";

 hence, then, "I am "Who"!".

  

 कोऽसि => **को**ऽहम्

\- Indeed a case of the pronoun metamorphosing into a noun!

The anonymous/universal kaH becomes I am Mr. Ka.

  

कस्त्वम् ? कोऽहम् ?

\- These sentences have the potential, then, to lose their Question Marks  

and become answers to the very questions, amounting to :

**You are Ka.  
**

**I am Ka.**

  

To add a linguistic note: All the interrogative pronouns in Sanskrit (*"kim*-words", in a way)

become Wh-words in English (and Quo-words in Latin, prior to this, I suppose).

Every ***Qu***estion has that imprint of Sanskrit "**K**im?".
