I face a problem in Shodhganga.

  

If a book/thesis has 12 chapters,

I need to download 12 times - chapter by chapter.

Again, one gets no easy/clear indication as to the title of the thesis/chapter etc: why?  

Why are we not allowed to download in a single stroke?

  

Or am I missing some proper method?
