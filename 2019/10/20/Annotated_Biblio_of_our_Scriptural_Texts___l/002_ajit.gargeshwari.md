There are several subject Bibliographies

Census of the Exact Sciences in Sanskrit David Pingree  

Vedic Bibliography Dandekar

and so on

  

If there is a long term funding then A Bibliography can be created and updated periodically as and when new publications are Known

To prepare a Bibliography for a few lakh books and a few lakh articles the cost will be very high will involve a lot of traveling to various libraries and accurately typing the collected information etc
