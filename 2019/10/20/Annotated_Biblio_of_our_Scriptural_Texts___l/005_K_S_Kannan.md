Thank you Prof. Wakankar and Dr.Chovlur, for the precious information.

  

As not all can travel to Dr.Sathe-ji's place and behold things physically,

could somebody make a book (or at least a booklet) out of the material collected there,

so that many may get to know about, and perhaps make use of, the information

that can be generated out of the hard work of such men of farsightedness and dedication?
