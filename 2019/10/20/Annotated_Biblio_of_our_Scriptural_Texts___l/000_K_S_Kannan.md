We have books like this one for the Bible

Pub. 1991: *  
*

*Catalogue of English Bible Translations : A Classified Bibliography of Versions and Editions......*

  

Now, we need books like these - annotated lists with full info -  

for the *Bhagavad Gita*, for the Upanisad-s, for the Vedic, our itihasa-s and purana-s etc.  

= for all scriptural texts of Hinduism  

(+ even of Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism = for all Indic religions).

  

Is anyone in this List aware of any previous attempts on these lines?

  

And if none exists, is it not worth attempting?

Can some scholars take up these - as some project etc.?

  

(I had heard someone in Maharashtra had made a personal collection  

of numerous editions/translations of the *Bhagavad Gita*).

(And I can guess Sri Shankara/Prof. Wakankar can spring us many surprises).
