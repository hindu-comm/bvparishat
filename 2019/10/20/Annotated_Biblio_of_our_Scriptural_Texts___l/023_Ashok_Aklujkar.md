Dear Prof. Kannan,

  

The word “late” does not appear in Prof. Wakankar’s original post. His use of “had” and “was” can be taken as suggesting that the \*collection\* being talked about is a thing of the past. However, this does not make the collection-maker an entity of the past.

  

Dr. Adheesh Sathaye specializes in Sanskrit/Indic story literature, including the Rāmāyaṇa and the Mahābhārata, and is diligent about collecting all publications or electronic versions of publications relevant to his research interests.
