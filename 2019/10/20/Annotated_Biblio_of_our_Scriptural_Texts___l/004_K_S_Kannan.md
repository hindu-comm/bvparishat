Thank you, dear Gargeshwari, for your resourcefulness and readiness to help.

  

While all the bibliographies you have indicated are fine and helpful,

I have a small problem with the *Vedic Bibliography*.

Whatever may be the intention of the initiator of the series,

much else than the Vedic finds its place there.

Of course, it is possible to argue that everything is related,

yet dedicated volumes will be even more useful.

Potter's, for example. Or Narang's on Kalidasa.

  

Yet the enormity of the task undertaken by Prof. Dandekar inspires our admiration,

even though I am not sure whether he did everything single-handedly

or had a body of assistants with him. How nice it would have been

had BORI continued with the task! How nice had Dandekar somehow ensured  

that the programme would not cease soon after his exit!  

  

Yes, your idea that these should be ongoing projects is very welcome.

The issues of travel and funding, as you cautiously point out,

are also there without doubt.

  

Projects such as these require leadership of men of vision,

and a continuous financial and secretarial support etc.

(And I cannot think of any institution else than Indic Academy

and the unwavering dedication of Prof. Nagaraj Paturi

to be competent in and confident of taking up worthy projects like these).

  

To use traditional terminology,

the vision is *brAhma* and

the execution is *ks"Atra;*

and the two should act in tandem.

Magnificence should be buttressed by munificence.

To cite Manu:

नाब्रह्म क्षत्रमृध्नोति, नाक्षत्रं ब्रह्म वर्धते।

ब्रह्म क्षत्रं च संपृक्तम् इह चामुत्र वर्धते ॥

  

Much good work was done, we may recall at this hour, by Prof SMKatre,

who summoned the best brains from all over the country

for the enormous Dictionary Project. How unfortunate all the same

that the powers that be scarce realise the importance and magnitude of  

the task he envisaged and progressed steadily with!

  

A public-cum-private system should endeavour to lend succour and support  

and provide all resources to such extraordinary projects! And the dream of how many

would be fulfilled thereby! How many may stand to benefit!  

How better and with what greater ease would academic work be better accomplished!
