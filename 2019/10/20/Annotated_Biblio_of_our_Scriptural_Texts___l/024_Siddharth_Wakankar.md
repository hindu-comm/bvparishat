Dear Sir,

  

Thanks for the info.about the place where the collection of Dr Sathe on Ramayana is well preserved.

  

There was one more Maharashtrian scholar from Pune who had a collection of books on Mahabharata .I just forgot his name. His collection could be in BORI,but,in the absence of the exact name/surname,it is difficult to access it or inquire about it.

  

Somebody from Pune would be helpful.

  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
