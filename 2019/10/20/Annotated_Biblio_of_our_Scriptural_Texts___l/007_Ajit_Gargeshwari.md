I second Prof Kanna's View. Its good to Know a particular lIbrary has available collection. Accurate Bibiliogrphic Information should be shared by scholars who have seen such valuable and magnificent collection. Those that can be digitised have to digitised and made accessible to all. Else what is the use ifmost valuable collection of libraries catches dust.
