Respected members of Bharatiya Vidvat Parishad,

Jai Shri Ram!

***How old is indigenous siddhantic astronomy?***

In the earlier two parts of this series, we have seen that whether it was VM's Panchasiddhantika or his Brihat Samhita, he was talking of nothing but a tropical Rashichakra. And in his Panchasiddhantika, he has made it very clear that out of the five siddhantas viz. Paulisha, Romaka, Vasistha, Paitamaha and Surya Siddhanta which were prevailing in 505 CE, Surya Siddhanta was his favourite..

पौलिशतिथिः स्फुटोअसौ तस्यासन्नस्तु रोमकप्रोक्तः\| 

स्पष्टतरो सावित्रः परिशेषौ दूर विभ्रष्टौ \|\| (P.S. 1/4)

The tithi resulting from the Paulisha is tolerably accurate and that of the Romaka approximate to that. The tithi of the Saura is veryaccurate, but that of the remaining two (viz. Vasishtha and the Paitamaha) have slippedfar away from the real. (K V Sarma translation).

Here also out of the five siddhantas discussed by VM in his PS, Paulisha and Romaka are not indigenous but of foreign origin! Ironically, these are the only two siddhantas that have been categorized by VM as ''tolerably accurate" where as the Vasishtha and Paitamaha, the two old indigenous siddhantas had "slipped far away" even in 505 AD. Thus, it is absolutely clear that except for the Surya Siddhanta, there was no indigenous Siddhanta even in 505 CE that could be said to be of any value as far as planetary astronomy was concerned!

***No indigenous Rashi-based astronomical work prior to the Surya Siddhanta\|***

We also find in the Panchasiddhantika that none of the other siddhantas including Paulisha and Roamaka talks of Mesha, Vrisha etc. Rashis, whether the so called sayana or so called nirayana!

Though it is said that there were as many as eighteen siddhantas prevailing in India then, but except for the five siddhantas listed in the PS, none of them is available anywhere. 

And if any of them had been available in VM's time, he would certainly have "listed" their basic principles in his PS!

***There was no indigenous Rashi-based predictive astrology in India prior to Varaha Mihira***!  

It is not only that there are no Rashi-based astronomical works prior to the Surya Siddhanta of Panchasiddhantika but we do not find any indigenous work of predictive astrology either based on Mesha, Vrisha etc. Rashis, whether Sayana or nirayana prior to Brihaj-Jatakam or Varahi-Samhita etc.

We have Minaraja's Yavana-Jaakam and Sphujidwaja's Yavana-Jatakam both Rashi-based astrological works prior to Varahamihira, but as the very names indicate, they are both of Greek origin and of early centuries of CE.          

There are a few "astrological" works like Atharva Veda Parishishta and Atharva Jyotisha but they are based on planets vis-a-vis Ashvini, Bharni etc. nakshatras and very rudimentary, mostly about omens!

Both these works are said to be of about 4th/5th century BCE at the earliest and are attached herewith. (In case of Atharva-Veda-Parishishta (Sanskrit), pl. expand it to 400% in Adobe Reader to make it readable!)

We hear about Garga and Parashara etc. in Bhatotpala's quotes but those quotes also are without any references to any Mesha etc. Rashis but talk only about planets/phenomena vis-a-vis various nakshatras!

Thus we can safely conclude that there was no predictive astrology vis-a-vis Mesha etc. Rashis in India prior to about first century BCE at the earliest. That also if we include the two Greek astrological works of Minaraja and Sphujidwaja!

So that certainly demolishes the myth that predictive astrology, that too based on Mesha, Vrisha etc. Rashis, and there also the niraadhar niraayana Rashis is of Indian origin.

It is really high time that we stop calling it as Vedic astrology and align our calendar to the Pauranic and siddhantic Rashischakra!

In the next part, we shall discuss the ''Age of Surya Siddhanta", the very first 'indigenous'' astronomical work of planets vis-a-vis Mesha, Vrisha etc. Rashis!

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!
