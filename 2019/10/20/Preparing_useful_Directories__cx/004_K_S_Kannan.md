Good, Sri Gargeshwari, that you brought this to notice.

Even this helps.  

  

But this can still represent but a small subset, I suppose,  

of the massive number of publishers, big and small.

  

A more helpful effort would be one that can help an Indian buy  

Indological books, and in all languages (though more particularly Indian).
