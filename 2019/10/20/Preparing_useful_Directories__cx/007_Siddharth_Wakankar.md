I remember to have read and studied a very wonderful and informative publication,viz. An Alphabetical Index/List of Indological Publications,covering almost all subjects in Sanskrit.It was published from Varanasi, some 50/60 years ago. One copy of that book is in the rich collection of the Oriental Institute,Baroda.I, however, don't know whether any of the present staff there knows about it.

  

Best of luck in your search.
