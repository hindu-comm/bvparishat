Would it be possible for BVP/Indic academy to build  

support systems for academic studies pertaining to Sanskrit  

\- such as getting prepared a Directory of Indological Publishers in India and Abroad?  

(This could later be published online or in book-form.)

This could also be a fit theme for a project, possibly.  

  

This would indeed be very useful to  

all students/scholars/lovers of Sanskrit.
