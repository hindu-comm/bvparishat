Dear Dr Kannan,

  

I knew the last of the Sardesai Brothers or Proprieters of Oriental Book Agency, Narayan Peth, Pune,whom I met some years back when he was winding up the business due to his advanving age.

  

After that,I never saw the nameplate also at that spot.

  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
