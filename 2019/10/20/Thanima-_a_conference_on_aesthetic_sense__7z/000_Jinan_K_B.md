Friends  
  
I am writing this mail to seek your suggestions about a keynote  
speaker for a conference I am co-organizing to address and rethink how  
to relook at aesthetic education, especially in architecture and  
design education.  
  
This is the third in the series and it is being held at NIT Calicut  
and co-organized by NIT (Architecture DPT, IIA Calicut, and EKF Pune).  
  
  
Thanima means authenticity in Malayalam.  
  
This time the conference is called WORD to the WORLD- exploring  
experiential KNOWING.....  
  
last years website is still on <http://thanima.co.in/>  
  
  
The THANIMA conference was initiated mainly to address the  
homogenization of our aesthetic sensibilities. The Western aesthetic  
is sweeping the whole world making the very idea of culture redundant.  
Cultural diversity would soon be eliminated totally if we don't  
explore deeply various aspects of the formation of aesthetic  
sensibility in humans. We need to come together to explore deeply  
various aspects of aesthetic formation, its roots, its connection with  
the context, formative process, connection with cognition, connection  
with culture and also how it gets awakened, distorted and destroyed.  
  
The intention of the conference was very clear not only in terms of  
the content but also the process. We were not expecting any expert  
pontification on the issues raised but to learn to hold our  
suggestions, explorations lightly, with humility, to invite more and  
people into a journey of inquiry.....  
What is unique about the content is that aesthetic sense has never  
been considered worthy of addressing the decolonization issue. Almost  
all the conferences on decolonization are about how to decolonize  
knowledge. Aesthetics is also a very intangible 'subject'.  
So purposely we were journeying into an unknown and intangible realm...  
  
I hope you can suggest someone who has done some really authentic work  
in the field.  
  
Thank you very much
