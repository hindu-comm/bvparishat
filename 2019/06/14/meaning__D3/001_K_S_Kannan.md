"The bottom-up vessel with its apertures thither..." -

In this mantra the vessel is presented as but a limb of the sacrifice. Not independently.

Even so, Prakrti is here presented as but the body of Brahman, the originator of the world, not independently....

  

The mantra cited occurs in Brihadaranyaka Up. also.

  

Others may improve upon my translation above.
