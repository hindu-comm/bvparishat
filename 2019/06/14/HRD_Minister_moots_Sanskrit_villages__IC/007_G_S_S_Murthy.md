I wholeheartedly support the idea oftranslating classics od other languages into Sanskrit. More scholars should get engaged in this type ofactivity. Then only can Sanskrit grow and be dynamic.

Not only just translations. Sanskrit should become a vehicle of communication in science and social sciences. Perhaps there is a dis-incentive for this typeofwork as it may not lead to doctorates. A good translation of a good classic is much more valuable thansome mediocre research work in a remote corner of Our Heritage. The mindset needs to change. We should get out of "charvita charvana" path.

Thanks and regards,

Murthy
