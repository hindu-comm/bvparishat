One very important point is: 



 Sanskrit scholars,esp. Pandits and those educated through Pathshala etc. should try to write in simple Sanskrit and should not show pedantry,because,writing in simple language is difficult and using difficult words which we came across while studying is comparatively simple..I think,we should ponder over this point and try to make our Sanskrit writing simpler.

Thanks and best luck.
