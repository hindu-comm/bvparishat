Translating across great cultural divides makes translations much more  
difficult.  
For example, earlier works of Isaac Bashevis Singer, when translated  
into English, lose much of their inimitable flavour because Yiddish  
and English are very different languages, and translating idiomatic  
Yiddish into English is much harder than translating idiomatic German.  
English translations of Russian literature also suffer from this  
problem.  
Why not translate writers like Premchand, Dinkar, Bharatendu, and not  
into simplified, but into fluent Sanskrit? At least then the deck  
would be stacked in the translator's (and the reader's) favour.
