True. As you said, we also need children's. literature first to slowly move up to the levek of Excellency.

Sanskrit lacks simple literature. Even the simple books in my 1st year portion needed so much of grammatical knowledge. When I finsihed the Laghu Kaumudi, I could get a hand over Raghuvamsha and Pratapavijaya.

Authors like Ramji Upadhyay have written very nice and easy literature, but still the level is only meant for those who know grammar.  
Comic Books, or the best way Id say is translating Amar Chitra Kathas into Sanskrit which would attract a larger audience.

What I feel is, that the demand for Sanskrit is very high but no Proper teaching methods and good teachers available. A Lot of Money is required and Government needs to be made aware of this.

We should properly frame this and email or tweet or do something so that the Government is made aware. And more than the government, the people. Some petition would help?
