Just as we have options to choose different languages in TV for Cartoon Channels, similarly, Sanskrit should be introduced in TV channels especially the Cartoon TV.

  

For instance, kids like Doremon, Chota Bheem, Jai Hanuman, Tom & Jerry etc...

  

Let our Kids be given the option of watching these episodes in Sanskrit....Once the interest is created, they will automatically develop that urge..I think Sampadananda Mishra Ji is already into such wonderful projects in Aurobindo Ashram and infants, kids, children have already developed the taste !

  

Such projects should be taken up and introduced at kids & students level.
