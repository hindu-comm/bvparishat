Namaste,

  

Creating replicas of 'Mattur' village should be taken up as pilot project. The govt. in collaboration with 'samskruta bharati' should propagate this. I was going thru a video where a simple farmer who started learning sanskrit at the age of 52 at the behest of his daughter, is able to read, write sanskrit. At home, all their family members speak in sanskrit.

  

Kudos to such families and may their tribe increase.

  

rgs,

sriram
