Dear Scholars,

  

The strength of Sanskrit is in poetry (chanda) and not in prose.
Sanskrit prose is no different from prose of any other language. Unless we versify the syllabus from 1st to postgraduate level it will do no good to the students. They will continue to be masters in their own subject and toddlers in other.

  

This approach of versification of syllabus will help the next generation overcome the menace of specialization.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
