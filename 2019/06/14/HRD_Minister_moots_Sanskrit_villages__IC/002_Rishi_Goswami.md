My suggestion is that massive work needs to be done.

In every language, there are translations of clasics like Pride and Prejudice, The Great Gatsby, Macbeth, Hamlet and other Shakespearean books,and even Japanese best sellers have English translations.

What we need to do is, at least translate 20 Classic Novels into Saral Sanskrit and release them for the common public.

It will enhance the vocabulary and also have certain usages of Karmavachya, Karmakartri, Sannanta, Nijanta Yangluganta etc so that someone who is illiterate in grammar also can slowly understand those usages.

I had infact attempted to translate GRRM's Book, A Game of Thrones and had translated 2-3 chapters in 1 months time. It was very difficult and I wasn't able to accurately translate it.

Still, I found my language improve alot in that process and I had to look up into books and find many new types of Prayogas.

Whoever takes up this task would definately gain alot of fame and even if isn't famous,it would be a great upakar to Sakala Sanskrit Jagat in my opinion.

I feel not only English Classics, but also Premchand, Dinkar and Bharatendu should be translated into Sankrit.

And what about couplets of Ghalibh and Mir?

There is so much work to do. This is my personal opinion. And also, my life's dream, if ever I am able to take up this task if someone doesn't.

Namaste.
