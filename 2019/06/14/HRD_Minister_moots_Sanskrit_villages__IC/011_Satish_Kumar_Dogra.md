A separate Sanskrit channel for Doordarshan would be the most effective step towards popularising the language. If they cannot produce original programs in Sanskrit, let them dub serials and other programs and put up a 24X7 channel in Sanskrit. Most people who know Hindi will gradually begin to understand the programs, and, in course of time, Sanskrit words will enter spoken Hindi.  

  

If we could somehow build up pressure in this direction, it will be a great service. A signature campaign could be thought of.
