Dear Shri Damodara Dasa,

  

Hare Krishna.

  

You seem to be a follower of ISKCON which follows the Brahma Madhva Gaudiya sampradaya.

Every sampradaya by definition has a collection of "shaastra" they hold as authoritative and by default regard the others as not so.

In this context, I would advise you to ask your Guru or anyone knowledgeable within your sampradaya for guidance rather than post such requests for advise on "dharma" in an open forum.

  

Dharma is always personal first and if there is a non-trivial reason for breaking one's word, the bill always falls due. This is not about some central authority figure like God/ Krishna punishing but the case is one of being punished by one's own actions. In this situation it is specious to go looking for "get out of jail" cards sourced from "shastra".

Use ithihasa-purana as a touch stone for finding the path of rectitude.

If the incident of Rukmini being betrothed to Shishupala or Subadhra being betrothed to Duryodhana are any guides, you will understand your own course better.

  

Also ask yourself if the above ritual falls within the practice of Narada pancharatra which you follow and how it is applied.

Dharma is a guide to finding personal happiness through groundedness in eternal principles and not a fetter to bind oneself in so that one can "demand" "heaven" as a price for having being miserable now.

  

Kind Regards,
