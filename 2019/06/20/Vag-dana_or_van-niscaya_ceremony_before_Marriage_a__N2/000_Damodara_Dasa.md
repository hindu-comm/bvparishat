Hare Krishna.

  

Respected Vidvaj-janas,

  

History of Dharmasastra, v2-1, 1941, pdf p.589-90, mentions that van-niscaya is a ceremony performed before marriage in which bride's father gives his word to bridegroom's father. Reverred Kane ji says that this procedure is mentioned in detail in Samskara Ratnamala (S.R.M.) on p.529-533.

  

I read SRM reference at

[https://archive.org/details/SAMSKARARATNAMALA](https://archive.org/details/SAMSKARARATNAMALA1)

  

It is a very good explanation. However, a few things were not clear:

  

1\. What is the allowed maximum time gap between marriage and van-niscaya?

  

2\. Can the promise be broken before marriage ceremony? If yes, in what circumstances? Also what are adharmik reactions if broken without considering circumstances?

\[Parasara-smrti 4.30 seems to give some indication on this\]

  

Also if someone can direct me to more detailed anaysis of this ceremony, it will be very helpful.

  

Thankyou,

Hari Guru Vaisnava das,

damodara das
