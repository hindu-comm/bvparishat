---------- Moderator's response -------

  

Though the post below is from a moderated member, we allowed the post to take the opportunity to clarify the scope of the list and preempt misgivings similar to the one reflected in the post.

  

Sanskrit, the language and Literature in it, Indian culture Studies, studies of S'aastras, studies of Indian culture as reflected in Indian languages and Literature so far as their relationship with Sanskrit, S'aastras and Indic Knowledge Systems is concerned, studies of Indic Knowledge Systems are within the scope of the list.

  

Every thing in the world , all current affairs etc. in some indirect way are connected to language and literature. On that basis, if that is accepted as within the scope of the list, the list loses its specific focus and turns into a list that discusses everything under the sun.

  

Issues like water crisis fall within the scope of the list only if the topic raised is, for example, water crisis reflected in Sanskrit narrative poems, water location s'aastra (jalaargala s'aastra ), significance of water in Vedas, Sanskrit poetry etc. traditional Vedic or other traditional Indian rituals performed during water crisis etc.

  

As a case in point, the post just posted a few minutes ago
