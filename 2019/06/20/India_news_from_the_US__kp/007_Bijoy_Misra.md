Prof Paturi,  

I agree. Sometimes i do feel like an orphan observing the road.

I was distressed when the Sanskrit College in Puri was devastated in cyclone.

But more serious devastation seems to have happened through oppression.

Many scholars and institutions have been uprooted.

I was attracted to the news item remembering my scholar friends in Chennai.  

I agree it is a whole different story. India has layers of history.

Let us walk and fetch.  

Best regards,

BM
