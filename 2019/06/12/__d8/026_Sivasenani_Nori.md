Again, though the query is addressed to the Mahamahopadhyaya, let me explain one type of variance in different calendars.

  

There are different civil calendars followed in different parts of India. So new years will differ (Visu, Bihiu, Ugadi/Gudi Padwa/Chaitra Suklaadi, Diwali etc.), names of year will differ (baarhaspatya-maana and chaandramaana), names and durations of months will differ (solar months, purnanta lunar months, amaanta lunar months) and even tithis like ekaadaSee (Arunodaya important for Vaishnavas, Suryodaya for Smartas, the latter day is considered ekaadaSee in case of viddha for some etc.). These are custom-based, surface level or interpretation based differences which do not contradict the single common religious calendar (the chaandramaana calendar) followed across the country.

  

A second difference, and this is a matter of concern, is in the computations within one system. The simple fact is that even within the same system - say the Non-drig-ganita panchangam followed by Telugu Smartas - something as simple as the ending time for any tithi is given differently in different panchangams.

  

Many of these panchangams have a brand value based on some scholar dating back to several decades ago. In at least one case, I found the present panchanga-kartas sub-standard. Centuries earlier Siddhantins used to write their own panchangam, it seems.

  

Eclipses provide a means of verifying the panchangams.
