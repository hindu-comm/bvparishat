नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

Why no "TWOpa\~ncaaga" ever agree with each other ?

  

                  ----- Vid Yadu

why no two Pncangas ever agree with each other ?

  

I am very much thankful to both Vids Narayan and Sivasenani for the help . I am relieved of a lot of burden .

  

About giving information -- yes , what I expect is one , rather each member, should get the maximum information from  

my posting - the point is this -- due to several reasons it has become very difficult to get the relevant information of a topic

and one does not know where to go - unfortunately it has become the order of the day that a student learns a single Sastram that too just a portion of it - वेदवेदाङ्गदर्शनोपवेदसमन्वय , as far as possible , should reflect in a post - this is not new-

some thousands of years ago it was there - the tradition got degenerated during the course of time . And I know that it

takes some time to digest the purport , depending on the योग्यता of the member .

  

Now the Question ---

  

We hardly have 49 verses of वेदाङ्गज्योतिषम् by Lagadha .

  

Varahamihira in 12 अध्याय , called पितामहसिद्धान्त , of his work पञ्चसिद्धान्तिका , offered the gist of वेदाङ्गज्योतिषम् - but there are differences between both .

  

Both Varahamihira and Brahmagupta , suggested that modifications to the सूत्र-s of वेदाङ्गज्योतिषम् are required ..

  

Even if you take the duration of a year there are differences among - वेदाङ्गज्योतिषम् - रोमकसूर्यपुलिशपितामहसिद्धान्त-s etc.

  

पञ्चाङ्ग-s are being computed taking two methods - पूर्वपद्धति and दृक्पद्धति । Scholars from both sides quote some प्रमाणम्

in support of their claims .

  

With Prof M N Saha , as the Chairman , a Calendar Reforms Committee was formed in 1953 by Prime Minister Nehru.

  

Having been requested , only 51 of 60 authors of पञ्चाङ्ग-s from across the country sent their Almanacs - also some people

expressed their opinions in person .

There were , of course , differences of opinion regarding certain issues ( when to celebrate a festival ,

देशान्तरसंस्कार etc ) among the members .

  

**After a scientific study of the subject , they have to , submit proposals to the Government for an accurate and uniformcalendar for the whole of India (?) . (question mark mine) .**

  

The Report (1955) was not welcomed by many scholars due to several reasons ( It seems many of the members were

**not trained in गुरुकुल system in वेद , व्याकरणम् , कल्प and ज्योतिषम् )**

  

By nature the subject is such that it is difficult to follow a standard procedure and keep track of the planets , stars etc

and it is possible only through योगिप्रत्यक्षम् ।

  

This is a very brief history and now you may draw your own conclusions .
