\<\< Why no "TWOpa\~ncaaga" ever agree with each other ? I am not familiar withpa\~ncaaga that followed in Southern India. Are ther discrepancies there as well ? \>\>

  

Although this query has been addressed to Dr Korada, and he is expected to respond to it, I express my opinions in this regard.

  

In general, in North India the luni-solar panchaangas are in use, whereas in South India the solar panchaangas.

  

In India about 30 different panchaangas are in use. In 1980s, I collected 8 different panchaangas from Maharashtra, UP, Bengal, Orissa, Tamil Nadu.

  

There are differences in different luni-solar panchaangas due to adoption of different ayanaamshas and also due to different methods of calculating planetary positions.

  

There are vaakya panchaangas and drig-gaNita-panchaangas. The former type is used in South India.

  

For analysis of some of the panchangaas, please see my article in Hindi:

If djvu viewer is not installed, it will have to be installed first. Alternatively, djvu format could be converted to pdf online (free).
