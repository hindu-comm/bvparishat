Prof. Ashok Aklujkar's paper (available at<https://archive.org/details/ThePanditTraditionalScholarshipInIndia.Manohar2001600dpilossy/page/n3>) covers the points stated in this thread and others as well. Still the source of the particular definition of paNDA as sadasadvivekinI buddhiH is not traced in that paper.

  

My recollection of the study of Sankaracharya's commentary on Bhagavad-Gita was that he defined paNDA as the discrimination between the eternal and the transient, but when I did a quick check I found paNDA defined as AtmavishayA buddhiH (not that there is a contradiction). It would be interesting to see where this definition of paNDA occurs.
