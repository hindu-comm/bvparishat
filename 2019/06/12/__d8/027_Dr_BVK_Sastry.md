Namaste



The question on ' Panchanga -differences' does not seem to be the focus, target or crux of the issue being sought ! Not even the main issue of debate !!

The question in its present phase is analogous to a debate like :

Why a straw differs from a fork ? why straw cannot do the work of fork? :: Why one panchanga is different from another panchanga in the 'calculation modalities' ?



The undisclosed complementary part of this question is : why all panchangas need the same 'tithi- vara-nakshatra-karana- yoga' related ' graha-phalas'? 



So the reworded question for exploration could be: How will 'ganita difference in sidhantas for panchanga-preparation' affects the 'phala-soochanaa/ shubha muhoortha nirnaya' in the work of a Jyotishi, who uses the ' Time linked Sky mapped position of planets, as provided by a software ( or traditional ujjain/ lanka reference lines) ? This surely is a 'Vedanga Jyotisha research question' and interdisciplinary.



This is a focused question for 'masters of Vedanga Jyotisha Education system' , the schools of Vedanga Jyotisha education in bharath, who are supposed to train and certify the output as a ' Jyotishi' (also called as mauhoortika, kaalajna, daivjna) for suggesting ' samskaara -kaala' ( not just the yajna- kaal -muhoorta ? ) 

The starting point is stock taking review of ' practice of Jyotishi's'- the 'data'.



The flaw is in this very modeling and approach. Vedanga Jyotisha is 'Darshana' - ' yoga-tapas based'- documented in 'Samskrutham'; provides analytics input for performance of 'vedokta -karma'. Vedanga Jyotisha is ' Jyotir-Yoga', ' Jyotir-veda'. The discipline is 'Vedanga'- an application utility for diagnostics ( *pareekshaa*) . Jyotisha is NOT the medicine (*parihara, aushadha*).



This is totally different from the 'science approach' which models its terminology, techniques, theories in a ' matter -frame' ( keeping out Consciousness, Life , Mind, different model of Matter-Mind-Energy relations, quantum approach which does not accommodate the ' pancha-bhoota model of cosmology'. Therefore, Scince is not able to see the same way as 'Vedanga Jyotisha', even though both schools use a ' referential calculation of sky mapped geo-centric position of planets ( = graha-ganitha)' for casting a chart. The use and interpretation are totally different. 



Modern Astronomy using a ' computational model of sky mapped planets' and physical model of the universe, has not provided any place for traditional vedic concepts of 'daiva', no concept of conscious-time, divinity of time , how to vision through the iron curtain of time ( tri-kaala darshana)' axioms. Radio astronomy is a techno-device of science for space exploration, the space of solar universe which is beyond the reach of human eye can. But these tools have no sensitivity to 'probe in to MIND (manas), see 'Devataa', sense ' soul-consciousness ( atma-chetanaa)' . These are foundation -fundamental axioms of Vedanga Jyotisha.



The long shot in the question is ' understanding the professional mode of power and operation of Jyotishi' which enable him/her to see through the time, make personalized predictions and counseling (phala-soochanaa :: linked to the axiomatic position of vedanga Jyotisha: phalaani
graha-chaarena soochayanti maneeshinah)' who uses '(defective/ deviant -?) panchanga' to cast the ' lagna ( or suggest a shubha muhootra) ? In other words , the socio-political part is :What makes a king / a politician take the advice of a Jyotishi? What power does a Jyotishi have which a king/ a politician does not have ? It is a deep plan to see the power game - structure. How reliable, cause-effect connected is the work of a Jyotishi? For future prediction reliability ?



*My personal note*: Debating on the differences of leaves (= panchanga- ganitha) on touching branches of close by trees (= 18 jyotisha siddhantas and their derivative practices) in sky (= Vedic Samskruth resource forest of Vedangas and vidya - shastras) will not address the 'root issues and causes ( = darshana bhedaat shaastra -pravrutti bheda)' which make the leaves unique on each branch of each tree. The debate certainly helps to clear the accumulated dust on the branches and trees. In earlier periods, acharayas used to do this as 'rain from sky, which would clean the tree from the top' and ' water the root for nurturing'. In the current period, the amount of rain fall is less; the dust rain is more intense with more pollutants. If the bharateeyas really think Vedanga Jyotisha has socio-economic relevance in shaping the nations policies in shaping the thinkers talking of five trillion dollar national economy, it would be imperative that they make serious effect in understanding what is 'Vednaga Jyotisha, the mundane astrology, the medical astrology and the like; invest on research and reshaping the vedanga Jytisha related Samskruth education and practices. All this may not gel with the 'secular' model of operation and media projections; but this is relevant for the safeguarding of the cultural soul of a nation called 'bharath that has become India' through several transitions'. It is a simple calculation: What kind of public investment in vedanga Jyotisha education -training-profession -certification -people would be needed to shape and steer a nation looking for five trillion dollar economy in five years ? Where does one look for masters of tradition ? In mandirs, saffron robes, universities, streets of cities, half-naked body displaying poor families ? Why ? How of filtering the Vedanga Jyotisha Human Resources ?? 



It is also a study and stock taking of how much damage has been done for traditional studies in India . and steps to correct; and make right projection of Bharateeya Culture world wide ! As my friend Dr.Yadu says- find the viniyoga ( application utility benefit of the discipline, now here, for our context). Ignorance or bad practice does not mean that the discipline is useless or bad.
