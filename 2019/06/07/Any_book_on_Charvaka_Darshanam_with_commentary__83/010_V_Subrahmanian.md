After getting many responses, it becomes clear to me that there are only 'reconstructed' versions of Charvaka darshana today. Here is one, with a Hindi commentary/explanation: 

  

# Charvak Darshan (Dharm Ke Dhande Ki Pol Ka Darshan): Hindi Indology

By Dr. Surendra Kumar Sharma 'Ajnat'

  

It contains the 'shaShThi' selection too.
