[TABLE]

It is well known to every student of the philosophies in India that NOT a single work of the Carvaka/Lokayata - neither any base text nor any commentary (although there were several) - is yet come down to us. Dakshinaranjan Shastri's *Charvaka-shashti* is an *eclectic* collection of sutras, verses, etc. drawn from both Carvaka and non-Carvaka sources alike. Jayarasibhatta's *Tattvopaplavasimha* is *not* a Carvakra work, despite the claim made by some, and opposed by others. Chowkhamba is known to have compiled a collection of Barhaspatya-sutras sometime in the last century but never reprinted it, as far as my knowledge goes.There may be one or two such books in the south Indian languages.
