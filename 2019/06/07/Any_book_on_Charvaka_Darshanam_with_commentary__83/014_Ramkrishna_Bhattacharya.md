Dear all,

Don't despair, my colleagues. One fine morning another Rahula Sankrityayana may discover the base text of the Carvakas and hopefully the commentaries thereon from a monastery in Tibet. Just think of my late lamented friend, Naginbhai's discovery of the *Nyayamanjari*-*Granthibhanga* from a Jain mss library. Let everybody be on the lookout in all the continents. It may turn out to be a chance discovery even.

Yours optimistically,

Ramkrishna Bhattacharya
