Many thanks Sir, I am curious about this particular verse that has been cited by the Sarvadarshana sangraha of Sayanamadhava 14th Century CE in the section for Charvaka darshanam:

The above author calls it an 'AbhANaka', a popular saying that existed in his times.

  

The commentary to this by Vidwan Sri Vasudeva Shastry Abhayankar, a more recent venerable author, is:

The above verse is also cited by Krishna Misra (12th Century CE) in his Prabodhachandrodaya.

  

This verse is found in the collection of Subhashitas too.

  

I would like to know what the original, ancient, Charvaka darshana and its commentary says about the above cited verse, if any. If there is any information about this verse/commentary in your papers/collection, I request you to kindly share the same here. If you know of any text predating the above, that cites this verse, please share the same.

  

warm regards
