It is worth pondering how formally debated cArvAka was in known history vs how much its practice was prevalent when its literary criticism happened.  

  

For a contemporary example, how much is communism actually an academically argued model for its merit? Its establishment happened more with muscle, then loyalists bought for controlling academic space. Even while it goes down there is very little academic/scholarly refutation of its tenets.  

  

Similarly cArvAka, while some of the available texts might be telling about it, it is unlikely we are going to be able to find its hypothesis by its proponents not just now but most probably even back then.
