Namaste

  

This forum consists of a wide assortment of scholars of an array of shastras including sangeetha and nritya. Here is a recording of a fine program that was presented recently in Bangalore. The theme is a re-presentation of select compositions based on raaga-s of classical music and featured in the cinema of some three or four and even more decades ago.

  

A team of accomplished artistes have presented those classical hits.
What adds luster to the program is the excellent compering by our Shatavadhani Dr.R.Ganesh in Kannada. As usual, it is full of scholarly inputs that enhance the enjoyment and appreciation of the program.
