Dear scholars,

  

*Prekshaa Pratishtana* takes great pleasure in inviting you all to the launch of five Sanskrit *Kāvya*s authored by *Śatāvadhānī *Dr R. Ganesh, Dr Shankar Rajaraman, and B. N. Shashi Kiran. *Vidvān* Janardana Hegde (Editor, *Sambhāṣaṇa-sandeśa*) will offer the books to the world.  

  

On: 16.06.2019 (Sunday), at 10 a.m.

At: Gokhale Institute of Public Affairs, Bull Temple Road, Bengaluru--560019.

  

This will be followed by a session of *āśukavitā* (extempore versification in classical meters) in Sanskrit and Kannada.  

  

Cover-images of all the *Kāvya*s are attached to this email. Scholars who wish to purchase the books can contact me ([shashi...@gmail.com]()).  

  

Best regards,

Shashi Kiran B N
