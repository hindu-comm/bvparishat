Good to know your credentials Prof. Shyamdev Mishra-ji.

  

Your response reflects a tone of anger and a tone of being offended.

  

If my request to you to provide references to each of the terms is the reason for this tone, I am sorry to have caused those feelings in you.

  

I understand that you expect the members of the forum to accept the terms to be from the traditional sources on the basis that they come from a professor of your credentials.

  

I wish I knew this earlier.

  

Thanks and regards,
