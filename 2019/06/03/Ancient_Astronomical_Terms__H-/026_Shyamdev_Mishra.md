Dear Sudarshan,

Your question is quite good.

Now, What is the arctic circle? As you know, it's an imaginary line encircling the Arctic region. It goes along the 66° 33' North latitude-regions around the globe. It's also known as Polar circle. In other words, it's a circle which has approx 23°33' radius from the Pole.

Now, according to ancient astronomy, the कदम्बवृत्त is the 23.5° circle round the Pole or ध्रुव। Since, the कदम्ब star revolves around the ध्रुव along with this path that's why it is called as कदम्बवृत्त. As the Equator or नाडीवृत्तम् is the महद्वृत्त or great circle which is 90° away from pole, the Ecliptic is 90° away from कदम्ब star. Therefore, ध्रुव and कदम्ब are the पृष्ठीय केन्द्र of Equator and Ecliptic accordingly.

As the कदम्ब star traverses along it's path the Sun moves along the Ecliptic. Since कदम्ब star moves in 23.5° circle, the Sun moves in a fashion that it makes 23.5° circle or Ecliptic from Equator. This 23.5° angle is called क्रान्ति.
