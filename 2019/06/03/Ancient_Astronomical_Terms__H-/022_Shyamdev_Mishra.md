Thanks Dr. Nagraj Pathari ji for your words.

Still I am waiting for any query regarding these terms, as believe it or not but all those terms have the crux of ancient astronomy.

Dear Shashi joshi ji,

As you know that according to (Modern) Astronomy, Tropic of cancer and Tropic of Capricorn are the imaginary circles based on latitudes in northern and southern hemisphere accordingly tilt towards the Sun during Earth's orbital movement.

Now if we think of these circles in ancient astronomical perspective, where the geocentric model is applied, the path of earth will be the path of sun e.i. ecliptic. Now during the course of its revolution along the ecliptic path, when sun reaches to the initial point आदि/आरम्भिकबिन्दु of Cancer or कर्क, the declination क्रान्ति (celestial arc) or the angular difference/distance between the equator and ecliptic, produced by their coincide सम्पात, is maximum, equivalent to परमक्रान्ति which means that after reaching to this point the sun will turn to the south and has southward motion or दक्षिणायन Summer solstice.

At this very point, the diurnal circle or अहोरात्रवृत्तम् or the daily revolution of sun; as it is seen, from east to west (सूर्योदयात् सूर्यास्तं यावत् ततः सूर्यास्ततात् पुनः सूर्योदयपर्यन्तं) due to प्रवहवायु (according to ancient theory) or भुवः अक्षभ्रमणम् or axial rotation of earth (according to modern principle) on the day when Sun is on tropic of Cancer मकरादिबिन्दु goes through the initial point of मकरराशि therefore it is called as मकराद्यहोरात्रवृत्तम्.
