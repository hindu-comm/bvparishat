Sir,

As said by wakankarji, the book of N E Muthuswamy is available at CBH Publication in two parts (whether it is same or not I dont know).

  

Sperical trignometry glossary i.e. english to sanskrit, is available at the end ofKhagola Paribhasha of Nagendra Pandey. One can get it from chawkamba.

  

May I get the contact details of Sahitya Parishad or Sanskrit Pustak Bhandar, Kolkata to purchase "A dictionary on Indian Astronomy".

Yours faithfully,

Dr.Muralikrishna T,

Sringeri
