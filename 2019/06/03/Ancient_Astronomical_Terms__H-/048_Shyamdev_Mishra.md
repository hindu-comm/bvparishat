Dear all,

despite having scarcity of quality time (as engaged in frequent travelling in summer vacation and familial compulsions) I could net resist myself to reply to Dr. Ramkrishna ji, as his point is exclusively related to my subject.

**  
**

**I will also comment on other frequently raised grammatical 'अयमस्मि.... topic.**

**Gurumurthy ji, I did not forget or overlook your point, but excuse me for this week, I will try to put my views forward related to your topic next week.**

**Sudarshana Ji, I would also love to share my viewpoint on your matter next week.**

**  
**

now coming to the कदम्बवृत्त topic,

Like पूर्वपक्षी I will also start and end my views with references. *I will also request to those who has slight interest in Ancient Astronomy to go through the post and have queries.*

In Monnier Williams sanskrit-english dictionary there are two words:**1. कदम्ब 2. कदम्बभ्रममण्डल,**

whereकदम्बmeans the Pole of the ecliptic andकदम्बभ्रममण्डलmeans The polar circle of ecliptic.

  

Now First of all, coming to your reference "कदम्बप्रसिद्धतारयोरभावाद् द्रष्टुः प्रतीतिर्नोत्पद्यत इति ध्रुवसूत्रे युतिः कथिता ।’ (सिद्धान्तशिरोमणिः, ग्रहयुत्यधिकारः, श्लो.५, वासनाभाष्यम्)". Its already said in the line, we just need to read between them. It has 2 things to point-out. One is that If the commentator is saying 'कदम्बप्रसिद्धतार'... it means it is प्रसिद्ध well known/used/cited star. The second thing is nevertheless it is well known but it is only imaginary unlike ध्रुव , so the क्रान्तिवृत्त is.

Now coming to my point, some of the general rules/theories/principles of any शास्त्र are very clear not only for the exponents but for the beginners as well. And it goes with Astronomy too. For an instance, there are no circles in the Celeste. All the circles/paths we talk about are imaginary such as क्रान्तिवृत्त, नाडीवृत्त, अहोरात्रवृत्त etc.

One more thing I want to urge that we should not mix/merge 2 different types of Astronomical theories/systems/models; the ancient geocentric model and modern heliocentric model.

According to ancient one, the Pole is star but the Sun is not whereas according to modern, Sun is star and Moon is Satellite. Therefore, at a time, one should follow either of the models. If we talk about क्रान्तिवृत्त as an orbital path of the Sun, 23.5° angled/tilted from the नाडीवृत्त then, one can not consider the 23.5° tilt in the earth. Similarly, if we consider the tilt of earth then, all our saying ( about 23.5° क्रान्ति of the Sun and कदम्बवृत्त) according to ancient model will become redundant. Because, in such situation, there is no need of कदम्बवृत्त and क्रान्तिवृत्त as we are accepting axial and orbital motion in the earth. In short, according to the model, you have to understand/explain things.

Now coming to the issue, I will talk according to Ancient model.

  

Take a small globe (earth-model) and hold it in a way that your left hand-fingers rest on the north pole-point and the right fingers hold the south pole-point. Now see the नाडीवृत्त (equator) which lies vertical and is perpendicular 90° to the याम्योत्तरवृत्त or Prime meridian (circle that goes along the poles and your fingers).

According to Spherical trigonometry, the surface center or पृष्ठीय केन्द्र of any spherical circle (गोलोपरिगवृत्त) is the point that is 90° away from each and every point of that circle. So,Here, the पृष्ठीय केन्द्र surface center of नाडीवृत्त is ध्रुव (the Pole star) as it is 90° away from each and every point of नाडीवृत्त.

Now think of क्रान्तिवृत्त;

As you hold the globe in above-said manner, the क्रान्तिवृत्त will be like a slanting circle (not vertical like नाडीवृत्त) making a 23.5° angle with the नाडीवृत्त.

now the question is that being a spherical circle (गोलोपरिगवृत्त) if the नाडीवृत्त has its पृष्ठीय केन्द्र (in the form of ध्रुव) then what is the पृष्ठीय केन्द्र of क्रान्तिवृत्त ? The answer is कदम्ब (the pole star of क्रान्तिवृत्त ecliptic).

Now, if it is 'ध्रुवात् जिनांशै: (24°) स्थानम्' as said by Ramkrishna Ji then, what do you mean by स्थानम् ?

As we know स्थानम् means a point or place. Then whyकदम्बवृत्तम्, कदम्बभ्रममण्डलम् like words used in texts copiously ?

As we know, वृत्तम् means circle.

Now I have 3 objections on the interpretation of Ramkrishna Ji which are as under:

1\. Like कदम्बवृत्तम्, why not word ध्रुववृत्तम् used ?

2\. Why कदम्बवृत्तम्

  वृत्तम् can not be स्थानम्. It is made/drawn by several स्थानानि or points. If you are at aस्थानम्point/place then you will most likely be stable/stationary. You can't move from that place/point. But, if you are in a circle, then your point/place can't be same all the time. you will be movable. With this geometrical concept, I would like to say that if कदम्ब is a स्थानम् not वृत्तम्, as Ramkrishna ji is saying, then It must be stable like ध्रुव then why the word कदम्बवृत्तम् is used ?

                                   
       जिनांशैर्यद्ध्रुवाद्वृत्तं तत् कदम्बर्क्षमण्डलम् ।

                                   
       यतस्तस्मिन् कदम्बर्क्षं भ्रमति प्रवहेरितम् ।।

                                   
       यत्कदम्बान्नवत्यंशैर्वृत्तं तत् क्रान्तिमण्डलम् ।

ध्रुवस्थानाज्जिनां(२४)शैर्यद्वृत्तं-तत्कदम्बवृत्तम्, यतस्तस्मिन्नेव वृत्ते प्रवहवायुप्रेरितं कदम्बतारा भ्रमति। कदम्बतारातो नवत्यंशवृत्तं क्रान्तिवृत्तं....(गोलपरिभाषा, सीताराम झा, श्लोकः २८-२९ ) ।

It means that the कदम्ब star revolves around the Pole star in its circle which has 24° radius. This star is being made revolving by the प्रवहवायु. And the क्रान्तिवृत्त is a 90° circle from the revolving कदम्बतारा star.

Now if you would say that this definition is given by पं सीताराम झा जी and not by भास्कराचार्य then, firstly everybody in the Ancient astronomical realm knows Pt. Sitaram jha ji as शङ्कर बालकृष्ण दीक्षित acknowledged/regarded him in his भारतीयज्योतिष and secondly, I will also give references from the सिद्धान्त शिरोमणि of भास्कराचार्य which says the same as said by पं सीताराम झा जी .

But before that, lets think of what पं सीताराम झा जी is saying, which is eventually my 3rd point of objection:

3\. If कदम्ब is a स्थान 23.5° (or 24° according to ancient texts) from ध्रुव (a stationary star/point) then position of the क्रान्तिवृत्त can not be the same as it is known (intersect नाडीवृत्त at गोलसन्धि or सम्पातबिन्दु). Because then क्रान्तिवृत्त will be parallel to नाडीवृत्त with 24° arc like अहोरात्रवृत्त (diurnal circle). Why?

Think about अहोरात्रवृत्त. Its a circle which is द्युज्याचाप arc away from the ध्रुव (पृष्ठीय केन्द्र). Like, the कर्काद्यहोरात्रवृत्त which is 23.5° (or 24°) away from ध्रुव

Then the क्रान्तिवृत्त will be like अहोरात्रवृत्त with 24° (distance from ध्रुव i.e. कदम्बस्थान) + 90° (distance from the कदम्ब) = 114° द्युज्याचाप arc.

That's why पं सीताराम झा जी rightly said that क्रान्तिवृत्त is 90° away from revolving कदम्बतारा star in its path/circle. So as कदम्बतारा moves in its circle the direction of the Sun keeps changing and by doing so, the path of Sun क्रान्तिवृत्त takes place and intersects the नाडीवृत्त. (Just like a stick in your hand. If you move your wrist roundly then the stick will create/draw a circle in the air/surface.)

So, now the question is that if कदम्बतारा revolves in कदम्बवृत्त then during its revolution, at what point it will make क्रान्तिवृत्तbeing intersected by the नाडीवृत्त ? Actually, when कदम्बतारा reaches at the 90° away from the सम्पात बिन्दु of याम्योत्तरवृत्त and कदम्बवृत्त then क्रान्तिवृत्तwill intersect नाडीवृत्त in the east.

As I explained here, in the same way भास्कराचार्य said in his सिद्धान्त शिरोमणि which later explained in मरीचि commentary.

Now I am providing the reference from सिद्धान्त शिरोमणि, गोलाध्याय, ग्रहणवासना -

सर्वत: क्षेपसूत्राणां ध्रुवाज्जिनलवान्तरे। योग: कदम्बसंज्ञोSयं ज्ञेयो वलनबोधकृत्।।.......

कदम्बभ्रमवृत्तं च बध्नीयात् परितो ध्रुवात् । (श्लो ४२-४३)

ध्रुवादिति। धृवस्थानाच्चतुर्विंशतिभागान्तरेण भवतीत्यर्थ:। तथा च विषुवद्वृत्तात्क्रान्तिवृत्तस्य तिर्यक्त्वादयनसन्धौ तयोश्चतुर्विशत्यंशान्तरितत्वाद्विषुवद्वृत्तस्य विषुवद्वृत्ताकारभ्रमणं क्रान्तिवृत्तस्य क्रान्तिवृत्तानुकारेण भ्रमणाभावात् कदम्बस्थानम् गोले नियतमपि ध्रुवात्यन्तरितश्चतुर्विंशतिभागान्तरे भ्रमतीति भाव:।
