Mr. Paturi,

I'm the associate professor in Siddhant and falit jyotish in Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan, Bhopal campus and been teaching for last 19 years at PG n UG level. I think this information will eradicate your doubts regarding the "authenticity" of the reply related to the translation of astronomical terms.

I guess, a lot of people on this forum know me, my authenticity n caliber quite well. It's just that people like me don't believe in bragging or trying to hog the limelight n limit themselves to the classroom teaching or understanding the शास्त्र.

I thought and still believe that this forum is for rational thoughts n thought provoking academic issues and certainly not for biased assumptions.

So if you or anybody else whoever you think is "authentic" has any doubt regarding this subject (Ancient Astronomy) or for that matter any post on this subject can and should extensively do शास्त्रार्थ or meaningful dialogue if you have any doubt rather than imposing your prejudiced assumption.

This/
