Thnx Prof. Paturi,

But, with all due respect your this sercastic reply also reflects your offensive attitude.

I reacted on your "Let's wait for the authentic reply from mr Iyenger" without knowing or searching the facts. If you would have raised your doubts on any particular translated word with the explanation I could have focused on that. Here again you are dragging and trying to engage me in "wrangling over ass shadow" for your vindictive satisfaction rather than focusing on the topic and having meaningful discussion.

And now on your allegation, if being a professor, a particular person can be authentic in your understanding/aspect then that (yardstick) should also be applicable for any other person.

Therefore it's your choice. You can engage yourself in paraphrasing my words the way it suits you better and satisfy your ego or you can still have a meaningful session.

rgds/
