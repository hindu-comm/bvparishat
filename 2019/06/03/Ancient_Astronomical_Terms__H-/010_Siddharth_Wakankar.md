I may point it out for the benefit of scholars that the late Prof.K.E.Muthuswami,a well.known Jyotisha scholar from Trivandrum and a former Hindi Professor, had prepared in English a Dictionary of Astronomy,based on different Sanskrit and Tamil/Malayalam texts. He used to visit our Oriental Institute Library when I was working there and refer to these books in southern languages

.

His book has remained incomplete due to his sudden death.

  

I have given a copy of that unpublished manuscript to Prof.R.N.Iyengar in 2013, as it is more useful to him in his studies.

  

Hope,he will enlighten us on this important topic with his vast expertise in this field.  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
