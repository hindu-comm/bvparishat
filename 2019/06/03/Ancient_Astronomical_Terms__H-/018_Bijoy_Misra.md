Dear Prof Mishra,

You are wrangling into a meaningless debate. While you did translate the terms, they are not used in the literature.

You may cite the list from सूर्यसिद्धान्त. आर्यभटीय appears older and I am a fan of its author.

I have interest in Astronomy and do teach the subject. We have common interest.

Please help out.  

Thank you.

Bijoy Misra
