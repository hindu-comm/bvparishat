Dr. Korada ji has raised a lot of interesting issues/topics to discuss. I want to take them one by one during course of time as, currently I'm travelling and quite engaged.

Firstly, I want to mention the subtle difference between शर and अक्षांश. Despite being called as Latitude in general, there is a very big difference between both of them. That's why अक्षांश can be undoubtedly termed as Latitude but that's not the case with शर.

Actually शर, which is also known as विक्षेप (english translation - deveation or purturbance) is the celestial difference/ distance of चन्द्रादि planet from the ecliptic (in other words from the Sun). So शर or विक्षेप is the celestial latitude (of Planet चन्द्रादि ग्रह).

भचक्रलिप्ताशीत्यंशं परमं दक्षिणोत्तरम्।

विक्षिप्यते स्वपातेन स्वक्रान्त्यन्तादनुष्णगुः।

तन्नवांशद्विगुणितं जीवस्त्रिगुणितं कुजः।

बुधशुक्रार्कजाः पातैर्विक्षिप्यन्ते चतुर्गुणम्।।

एवं त्रिघनरन्ध्रार्करसार्कार्का दशाहताः।

चन्द्रादीनां क्रमादुक्ता मध्यविक्षेपलिप्तिकाः।। (सूर्यसिद्धान्तः, मध्यमाधिकारः, श्लो 68-70)

विक्षेपो नाम स्वविमण्डलक्रान्तिमण्डलयोर्याम्योत्तरमन्तरम् अर्थात् ग्रहगतकदम्बप्रोतवृत्तं क्रान्तिवृत्ते यत्र लग्नं स्यात्तद्ग्रहस्थानम्। स्थानबिम्बयोर्यदन्तरं कदम्बप्रोतवृत्ते तावाँस्तस्य विक्षेपः। (सूर्यसिद्धान्तः, तत्त्वामृतभाष्योपेतः, पृ.सं.47, चौखम्बा प्रकाशन, वाराणसी)

In short, the orbit of the moon and other planets called as विमण्डलवृत्तं or ग्रहविमण्डलवृत्तम्. All विमण्डलवृत्तानि intersect ecliptic at some point which is called as पात or सम्पात बिन्दु. As we know that the पात of चन्द्रविमण्डल and क्रान्तिवृत्त is popularly know as राहु or ascending node and केतु descending node. As there are nodes of the moon-path, rest of the planets also have their nodes पातबिन्दू depending the intersectional points of their orbits with the ecliptic.

Now, as the moon reaches to either of those nodes, the शर (विक्षेप) or the याम्योत्तर (north-south) difference between चन्द्रविमण्डल and क्रान्तिवृत्त becomes zero and as the moon leaves those nodes, the शर increases. Same happens to other planets ग्रह as well.

Here one can easily notice that the शर is a inconstant whereas अक्षांश is constant.

Latitude or अक्षांश is one of the major coordinates to determine a particular place on the earth. As I said in my previous post, ध्रुवोन्नतिः अक्षांशः i.e. the angular distance of the Polar star from the north or south horizon (depending on which hemisphere you are posited). Suppose, the angle between the northern horizon and pole star is 30° then the latitude अक्षांश of that place will be measured as 30°. So it's quite constant.
