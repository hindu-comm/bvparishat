Sir,

  

Thank you for this info.

  

Prof.Muthuswamy had given me a copy of ,I think, first 300 pages or so in early years of 2000, saying that the work on it is in progress.Afterwards, when I went to Trivandrum in 2005, I was told that he is no more.That is the reason that I don't know about its subsequent publication.  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
