I admire the analytic writing in this thread. I would request the respective scholars to post

research essays on their studies for public education.  

Through another effort, I went through a large number of papers submitted to an international

conference, many on ancient astronomy. They were of gross assumptions and unsuitable  

for scientific thinking. I am heartened to see the new breed of analysis.

Best regards,

BM
