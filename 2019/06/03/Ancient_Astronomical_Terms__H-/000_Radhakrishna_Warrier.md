What were the Sanskrit terms that ancient Indian astronomers like āryabhaṭa, Brahmagupta and others used for the following?

1.  Equator 2.  Earth’s axis 3.  North pole (and south pole) 4.  Latitude 5.  Longitude 6.  Tropic of Cancer 7.  Tropic of Capricorn 8.  Arctic Circle 9.  Celestial Sphere 10. Ecliptic 11. Precession (of the equinox)  

  

There are of course new technical terms (neologisms) created from Sanskrit base which are used in technical discourses in modern Indian languages.

For example, purassaraṇam (പുരസ്സരണം पुरस्सरणम्) is a new technical term created in Malayalam for precession of equinoxes. I am not sure if this word was used by ancient astronomers like āryabhaṭa.
