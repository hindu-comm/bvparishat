May I again bring to the notice of the scholars participating in this thread my previous note, where I referred to the Sun being referred as विन्ध्यवीथीप्लवङ्गमः in आदित्यहृदयम् (वाल्मीकिरामायणम्)। It looks to me that the author of the hymn might be referring to the movement of the Sun during a year in a narrow strip along the ecliptic which could be called विन्ध्यवीथी । I would like to know whether any commentary on the hymn throws any light on this epithet and its interpretation. Scholars specialising in Ancient Indian Astronomy might be aware of this.

Regards and thanks,

Murthy
