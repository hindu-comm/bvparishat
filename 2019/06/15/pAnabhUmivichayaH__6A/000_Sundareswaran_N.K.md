Dear scholars,

I am preparing for a talk in a conference to be held in Sree Sankaracharya University of Sanskrit, Kalady during 11th and 12th of July 2019. The topic chosen by me is :

"***What has a नैष्ठिकब्रह्मचारिन् got to do in the private 'drinking room' of राक्षसराज ? : A critique on the canto पानभूमिविचय of Valmiki Ramayana.*** "

I seek suggestions of ideas, thoughts, and references to similar previous studies from learned scholars.

Thanking in anticipation,

With Pranams,

nks
