**A Unique Dialogue from the Bṛhadāraṇyaka-Upaniṣad**  
  
The word “Upaniṣad” means that which eliminates all that is most undesirable in one’s life —namely fear and sorrow— and leads the spiritual aspirant to the knowledge of oneself as pūrṇa, whole and free of strife and limitations. The teaching in the Upaniṣad is always presented in the form of a special dialogue between the guru and the śiṣya known as saṃvāda, where the student listens to the teacher with utmost reverence. In this retreat, we shall be studying in depth a special dialogue between the sages Yajnavalkya and Maitreyi, which expounds the truth of the self as limitlessly whole and joyous. Presented within the larger backdrop of āśrama-dharma (duties at various stages in one’s life), this timeless dialogue highlights the purpose of marriage and married life (gṛhasthāśrama) in the Hindu dharma as a salient preparation for self-knowledge (ātmajñāna) and renunciation (sannyāsa).
