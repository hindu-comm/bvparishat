Dear Patel-bhai,

When I wrote a paper on two obscure Sanskrit words related io the Carvaka/Lokayata (subsequently published in the *Journal of Indian Philosophy,* (2011) 39:167–171) ) I had to move from pillar to post, from one library to another, in order to consult as many Sanskrit *kosha*-a as available, to an enormous expense of time, bus fare and energy. But then I was more energetic, so I could finish the work. No further studies in semantics would have been possible at my age but for your systematic uploading of one *kosha* after another. I can now work with ease again if health permits. *dhanyavaad.*

One query: Do you have access to the *kosha* by JaTaadhara?. The *S'abdakalpadrume* mentions his work (e.g., s.v.*padaartha*).

Warm wishes,

Collegially,

Ramkrishna Bhattacharya,
