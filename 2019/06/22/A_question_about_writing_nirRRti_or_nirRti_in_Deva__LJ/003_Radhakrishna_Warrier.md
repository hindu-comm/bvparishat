In Malayalam pañcāṅga-s, I have seen only the equivalent of निरृति (നിരൃതി). This is true of both pre-script reform (pre 1985) and post-script reform printings. This is also true of published matter other than pañcāṅga-s. In hand-written matter, you cannot mark the repha symbol (a small vertical bar in Malayalam writing) above vowels; it can be marked only above consonants.

Regards,

Radhakrishna Warrier
