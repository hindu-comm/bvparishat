Dear all

  

I was doing a small research wchich is the correct method to write the vowel ऋ preceeded by र् consonant. I have checked in the old manuscripts where I could only seeनिरृति and neverनिर्ॠति. The later is widely used in modern days and in all the fonts. But I don't understand how can we have conjunct to a vowel. After consulting n number of MSS, consequently, I strongly believe the former is correct. However if any scholar would recomend any other options I would be grateful to know. Thanks

And here is the difference I have made in Rgveda
