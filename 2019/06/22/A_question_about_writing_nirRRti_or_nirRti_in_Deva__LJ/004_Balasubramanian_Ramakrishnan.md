But it looks like the Malayalam is following the other and not निरृति. I can’t read Malayalam, but the second rR^i is almost the same as it would be in grantha, where the second symbol is added to the consonant to get syllables like kR ^i etc. But the Vedic grantha texts actually separate the repha and R^ikaara and write them left to right separately.
