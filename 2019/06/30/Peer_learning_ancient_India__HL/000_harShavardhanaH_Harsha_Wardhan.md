Pranam to all,

  

This is perhaps a very specific question, but I am trying to find out if there are any instances of peer learning in ancient India.

  

The general, lay understanding of Indian knowledge systems is that it was predominantly guru-led. But it is also our personal experience that in many student communities, natural discussions and activities amongst students lead to knowledge building also.  

  

Was there any sort of recognition or encouragement of emergent learning processes in the educational systems in India?

  

Any guidance would be thankfully received.

  

with regards

Harsha
