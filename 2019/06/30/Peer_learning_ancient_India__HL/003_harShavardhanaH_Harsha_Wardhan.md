Thank you so much Dr Kannan for reminding us of the excellent quotation

  

And two thanks are due to Sri Nagaraj garu: one, for introducing the concept of unique dyadic feature pairings in Indian society/systems, and two, for showing the importance accorded to the peer in Indian knowledge systems (so much so that the teacher is first a peer)

  

with kind regards

harsha
