Dear Harsha Vardhan garu

  

Namaste.

  

The traditional method of study involved (and it still involves, in some places) the following:

  

1\. Teacher teaches the panktis (lines) from Sastra to students

2\. Chintana - Students learn the lines by-heart, revise the meaning of those lines explained by the teacher and then discuss the meaning among themselves (here it is strongly recommended that chintana should be 'hot', i.e. immediately after the class, or at least on the same day)

3\. Recite the lines in front of teacher and ask any doubts regarding previous day's lesson. Sometimes teacher also questions the students about previous lessons.

  

The importance of Chintana cannot be over-emphasized in the traditional method. In the famous sloka - aachaaryaat paadamaadhatte.. (quoted by Prof. Kannan), the self-revision and discussion with peers encompassed by Chintana is explicitly stated.

  

Once a Sastra has been mastered, the Sastrasabha (also called Parishad, Vaakyarthasadas and sadasyam - still done after marriage amongst Telugu Brahmins, but only in name, real discussions are extremely rare) becomes the forum for peer-learning where intricate matters of Sastra were discussed and settled. The Tamil Sangams and the Buddhist councils could be thought of as being similar. In major religious rites, even today, parishad-anuj\~na is taken (again only in name, but the tradition is preserved) before commencement. The sutras in various Sastras are thought of as culminations of such discussions. Respect for Guru does not mean that knowledge was frozen; development in thought occurred, but without disrespecting tradition. For instance in Grammar from Panini to Nagesa Bhatta (to Tata Subba Raya Sastry), various issues were discussed; respect for munitrayam did not mean that development of the subject has stopped. As seen in the bitterness between Jagannatha Pandita Raja and Bhattoji Dikshita, there were vehement disagreements as well in the process.

  

Regards

Senani
