Dear Sri Harsha-ji,

  

This is one of the interesting aspects of of traditional/premodern Indian worldview/culture including teaching-learning traditions: pairs of features opposite to each other can comfortably co-exist, confounding the superficial observer. Worldly-Otherworldly, violence--non-violence, Family-centric--Asceticism-centric worldview , the list is big.

  

Now, coming to this question of significance of guru and non-guru factors such as peer-learning. This is a similar pair. There is an intense, intricate and interesting balance between these two like in the case of all these other pairs.

  

Peer learning:

  

1\. All learning including that from the guru has always been considered peer-teaching / peer-learning. Evidence: use of the word "saha" while talking about studying , learning etc. For the verb पठ , the idiomatic way of saying is as follows: If रामः is s'ishya and कृष्णः is the guru, idiomatic way of saying that Rama is studying with Krishna as guru is : रामः कृष्णेन ***सह*** पठति । This word*सह*is so crucial in talking about the teaching-learning activity/lineage/tradition. The famous mantra which can be called a love-duet sung by guru and sishya together, is saha naa vavatu and the mantra has the word saha repeated in all the first three sentences of that short five sentence mantra. The mantra highlights the view of guru and sishya pair towards themselves as persons together.

  

2\. Anyone who studies in the traditional gurukula system knows/remembers the role of one's aas'ramaagraja ( = s'ishya senior to oneself ). The teaching method used to, as a system, includeaas'ramaagraja ( = s'ishya senior to oneself ) conducting the follow up to the guru's teaching.

  

3. In north India, the word 'gurubhaai' is as popular as the word 'guru'. Studying with gurubhaai is part of the traditional teaching-learning tradition.
