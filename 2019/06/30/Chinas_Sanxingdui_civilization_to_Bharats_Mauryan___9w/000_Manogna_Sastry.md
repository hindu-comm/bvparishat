Namaste to all the members of this group.

  

Megh Kalyanasundaram and I share our recently written note 'China's Sanxingdui civilization to Bharat's Mauryan empire: an attested silken connection and its potential implication for Indian chronology' as a part of additional material that contributes to our paper on "Dating the parinirvana of Gautama Buddha: Heinz Bechert's Echo Chamber". We attach the links to both these papers below:

We look forward to the feedback that helps us engage constructively on the subject.

  

Warm regards,
