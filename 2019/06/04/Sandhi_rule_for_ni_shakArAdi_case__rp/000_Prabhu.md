When a “श”कारादि पद follows नि: upasarga there is no lopa of visarga in the resultant as in, for eg:  
नि: + शब्द: = नि:शब्द:  
(although in vernacular usage we see निश्शब्द...)  
In contrast, for non-“श”कारादि words there is the lopa of नि:’s visarga, as in for eg:  
नि: + चल = निश्चल  
  
What is the sandhi rule statement, if any, for  
नि: + “श”कारादि = \<\> case?  
  
I searched in this forum’s messages as well as grammar books online. I couldn’t find the statement.
