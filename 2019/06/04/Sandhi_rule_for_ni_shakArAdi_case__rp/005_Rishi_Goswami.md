Also, Neeleshji Mahodaya has done a lot of hard work in this area.

If you understand Saral Sanskrit, he has explained many of the Sutras in easy language on his website, [ashtadhyayi.com](http://ashtadhyayi.com). You can search for the respective Sutra and understand it with meaning. I personally refer to his explanation many times, if I don't understand in balmanorama or padmanjari.
