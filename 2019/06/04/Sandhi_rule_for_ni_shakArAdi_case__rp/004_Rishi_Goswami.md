Read in your own language.

Buy Hindi book of Laghu Siddhant by Motilal Banarasidas Press or from Chaukhambha Press, by Tika of Gopalacharya. Or buy both.

Using English to learn Sanskrit is not abhishta, I don't even understand when scholars use difficult English translated terms like substratum and locus.

If You're from South, may refer to some mother tongue tika because all Bharatiya languages have by and large the same grammar and structure, like Sub Ob Verb and mostly the vocabulary can be Sanskritik in all languages.

Will get confused if you read in a language which isn't your mother tongue. It is just my personal opinion and advice.

Best wishes  
Rishi.
