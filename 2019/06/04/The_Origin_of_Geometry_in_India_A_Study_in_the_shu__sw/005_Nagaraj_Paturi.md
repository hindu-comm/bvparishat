The English translation of the Intro to the book on the web page says:

  

As its title suggests, this book offers an edition-translation of*Baudhāyana Śulbasūtra*and his commentary*Śulbadīpikā*, composed by Dvārakānātha before the sixteenth century.Belonging to the ritual literature of India, the Śulbasūtras are treaties detailing the construction of altars, offering tables, sacred enclosures, etc., necessary for Vedic sacrifices.Dating from the last centuries before the Christian era, they show that the Indian mathematical knowledge of that time was comparable to the knowledge of contemporary civilizations in substance, but very different in form, revealing its oral character.This edition-translation is accompanied by a detailed introduction situating the mathematical knowledge of ancient India in its historical evolution, from the end of the Indus civilization to the classical period, and in its ritual context.To that end, the investigation did not only take into account the*Baudhāyana Śulbasūtra*, but it was extended to the three other Śulbasūtras (by Āpastamba, Mānāva and Kātyāyana) edited and translated (SN Sen and AK Bag, Delhi, 1983), as well as to an untranslated edition (D. Srinivasachar and VS Narasimhachar , Mysore, 1931) from one of the commentaries of*Āpastamba Śulbasūtra*, thanks to which the*Śulbadīpikā*could be dated.
