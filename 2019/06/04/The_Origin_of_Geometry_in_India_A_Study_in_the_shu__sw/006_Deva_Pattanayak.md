I understand the point Jean is making. His title, "The mathematics of the Vedic Altar" is appropriate. Mathematics is a language of sciences and is used to develop theories to solve or find answers to many problems, such as predicting weather or designing a computer chip. Also Ved means knowledge and Vedic Mathematics may mean knowledge of mathematics or mathematics developed during the days when Vedas were written. It might have been before that as Vedas were recited orally and transmitted from generation to generation by sruti( listening and uttering).

People who inhabited India in the past had advanced their understanding of nature both philosophically as well as in practical engineering sense. How else one can explain the complex mandiras that stand today. An example is the sun temple, Konarka in Odisha. It is designed in a such a way that the first ray of the sun will fall on the face of sun deity which was held above the ground by carefully balancing the gravitational force of the earth against the magnetic force of a huge properly designed magnet at the top of the mandira.

Just imagine designing it by trial and error method.

It will be better if Indian educationists and linguists work together to write books in different languages without english words. Clearly in those days Indians did not know english. Instead of saying Vedic Geometry, the proper way to say is Jyamitri known to people during the Vedic times. As a matter of fact geometry is upabhransha of Jyamitri or Jamitry.

I am in favour of a renaissance of every Indian languages along with the freedom to all to choose their language of choice. Language is a way to communicate and does not exclusively own concepts, ideas and knowledge.
