Thank you very much for your good suggestion. Many scholars and writers are suggestion XeLaTeX for book publishing. I also tried to learn XeLaTeX and spent many hours on Youtube tutorials, browsed many websites. But still I am unable to enter the XeLaTeXworld. May be it is my ignorance. I used MiKTeX console and Texmaker for LaTeX but I am not able to catch it.
