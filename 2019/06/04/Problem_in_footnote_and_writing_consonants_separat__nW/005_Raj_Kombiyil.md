Dear Yogananda Ji,

Greetings!

I am trying to typeset multilingual documents with XeLaTeX. I am successful in doing so. I would like to know more about Fonts (unicode) and kind of keyboard (transliteration scheme) you use. Pls cc me (if you don't mind) in this conversation, so I can benefit from your pointers. Specifically with XeLaTeX. Any links etc also will be helpful. If you don't mind.

Thank you.

praNAms,

Raj
