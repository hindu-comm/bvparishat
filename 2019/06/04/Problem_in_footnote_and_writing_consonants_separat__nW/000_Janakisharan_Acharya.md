Respected Scholars,

Pranamas to all !



  I am working with my new book in Adobe Indesign CC 2019 and I am using Unicode Fonts (mostly I use Kokila & ChanakyaBBTUni). There I am facing some technical problems which I would like to share with you.  
  
Respected experts are requested for help to deal with following issues –

  

1.  When I insert footnote in MS-Word using Unicode Fonts, numerical
    digits appear in Devnagari (kindly see "**01\_ Footnote in MS
    Word.png**") , But in Adobe Indesign I don’t find any option to
    insert numerical digits in Devnagari. (kindly see**02\_ Footnote in
    Indesign.png**)  
      
2.  In MS word, I can write consonant cluster in a single ligature and
    also I can write two or more consecutive consonants separately using
    ^ and ^^ (zero width joiner and zero width non joiner). (Kindly
    see**03_consonants Writing in MS Word.jpg**) But this option
    doesn’t work in Adobe Indesign CC 2019. (kindly see**04_consonants
    Writing in Indesign.png**)  
      
      
3.  I use Baraha Direct 9.3 for Unicode fonts and there I get this ^ and
    ^^ (zero width joiner and zero width non joiner) option. But I would
    like PRAMUKH IME for typing in Unicode fonts, but problem is in
    Pramukh IME that I am unable to write two or more consecutive
    consonants separately or in a single ligature in Adobe Indesign CC
    2019.  
      
    I would be grateful to experts for helpi  
      
    With regards
