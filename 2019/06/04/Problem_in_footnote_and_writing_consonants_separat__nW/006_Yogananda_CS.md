Namaste,

  

Glad to know that you are successfully using XeLaTeX. Will keep you posted.

  

Seeing the interest of a few to XeLaTeX, we are contemplating organising a 2-3 day workshop (in Mysore) on Indic languages on the computer, in general, and XeLaTeX in particular. If there is a good response in this list, I would be happy to organise one such event.

  

regards......yoga
