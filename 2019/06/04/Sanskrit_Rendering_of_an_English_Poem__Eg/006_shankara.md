Wakankarji,

  

I collected your paper on Harachandra Tarkapanchanana from my friend and read your introduction to the text and the Sanskrit text of Mataparikshottara. I am really glad that I got a chance to read it. Thanks a lot for sending it to me.  

  

I had read earlier, 'Resistant Hinduism' by RF Young and also the detailed introduction by S.L. Katre to 'Sastratattravinirnaya' of Nilakantha Gore.  

  

regards  
shankara
