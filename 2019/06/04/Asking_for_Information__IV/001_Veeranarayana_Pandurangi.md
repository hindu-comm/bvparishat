Sriman, you can look in you tube for numerous vidvatsabhas held mostly in Bengaluru, Udupi and sringeri. These the happening places. I can give contacts of persons organising these sabhas.

Shalaka are not that much available in YouTube, I suppose. But KSU too conducts them in November usually to select students for national level shalaka examination across shastras that is conducted by rashtriya Sanskrit sansthan in December or January. There are notifications available in sanskrit.nic. contact number can be made available.
