Namaskaaraha !

I am trying to find out some information of the following two topics to develop a course on "Sanskrit in Modern Context"

01. Contemporary scholarly assemblies (*vidvatsabhā*)

02. Traditional examinations (e.g.*Śalākāparīkṣā*) etc.

  

Therefore, I kindly request you all to help me to make success my effort. Please inform me any source regarding thistopic.

  

Thank you.
