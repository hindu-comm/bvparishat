"You are right -- but , to be frank , most Indians are not serious in their Research - I did not take up a single Project because there are no good students , who want to really learn / work - every six months we have to send a false report about the Progress - that we cannot do .Even many teachers do not have adequate knowledge in their fields - most , if not all , once selected as faculty do not touch any book - who to blame ?

  

So many such proposals are just utopian ideas."  --------Prof. S. Korada

  

  

Dear Subrahmanyam_ji

  

Namaste. I like your reply above. It is frank and inviting. Interestingly, we would have been collegues now, had I accepted a reader position in your university , way back in 1979! Now I work for myself and hence can be open in my discussions with you and others, Also I believe that self confidence and the sankalpa to do some thing are required before undertaking any activity.

I also believe past experience of any one including friends and relative does not by itself guarantees future innovation or success. Hard work and enthusiasm are needed as well as open collaboration. In the past the Gurukul system emphasized on imparting knowledge by the Guru on his disciples, who are elevated to the Acharya positions after applying their knowledge in solving problems facing the society. They form their own Gurukulas. The saptarishis were not related and if I am not wrong their progenies did not inherit their ashrams.

What can be done to circumvent student apathy towards research, Here are some of my thoughts.

  

1, Research proposals must be focussed on solving some outstanding problems facing the human society in India. Funding is coming from the poor people of India and the expectation is to improve their lives.

2\. Degrees must not be conferred only to fill the requirements of academic positions.

3\. Post graduate education must lead to jobs and better jobs preferably in India.

4\. Professors must teach and train and work together in modern interdisciplinary disciplines. Research topics must be defined with aims and hypothesis which are not utopian but achievable with the resources available and with the time limit allotted by the grant.

5\. Higher education and research benefits when good education is imparted in the preschool and elementary grades as well as in high school and undergraduate colleges.

6\. State government funds must go towards laying down a solid foundation and used primarily to aid schools and four year colleges, leaving behind higher education to the central government. I felt that when I studied in Odisha. By the way I was the best graduate of the state of Odisha. I am saying this because there are few who question my sincerity and even ability.

7\. Research is universal and knowledge sees no boundary. In these days of the internet distance is not a factor and a lot of literature is available freely. One can successfully form teams across the continents and produce good results. Here again my personal experience is in staffing and managing a high end research group at Pune, India. It was not easy to bring it up to international standard but with proper guiding and training not only the group solved day to day technical issues but one of the workers was the author of a patent. The problem of advanced technology is the access to experimental data which is closely guarded.

8\. In the are that we are talking experimental data is available or can be produced because we are talking about ourselves, our mind and body. Here I believe India has an advantage because of the shastras. Problem as I see is that it is so vast and written in slokas in Sanskrit that had to be properly translated. When you wrote back saying that the activities in the stomach affects though process, a bell rang in my head. I thought there are eight elements involved in the production of sound and stomach is not one of them.

9\. So here is a focussed project. To start with the task is do research and clearly find out by going through Vedic, Buddhist and Jain literatures. After that conduct a literature search covering non-Indian sources, the Greeks, Mayan, Arabic, Judeo-Christian etc.

10\. After that form an interdisciplinary team preferably at the University of Hyderabad to start with.

By the way as I said I work for myself and I believe I shall be able to officially fund the initial phase of this effort in India . Of course we have to go through official channel at your university. If you want to proceed further on this, please write to me using my email below about the level of funding required( keep it to absolute minimum, but sufficient to do the task within three to six months.

Looking forward to your reply.

  

With Warm wishes and best regards

Deva Pattanayak

ps; By the way do you know Dr. Mandyam Srinivas e is an eminent Physicist and an indologist. Both of us received our Ph.D.s from the same advisor, Professor Emil Wolf of the university of Rochester, Rochester NY. I am giving you my experiences, but you will find my contributions by googling my name in the internet.
