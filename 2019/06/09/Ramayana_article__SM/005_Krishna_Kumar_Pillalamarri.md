Dear Sri Kaul, Dr. Mishra,

  

First, I am no 'Doctor'. An ordinary engineer.  

  

There is a certain fallacy that is evident in yours and Sri Mishra's replies to my question, and with your permission, I would like to point it out. There are many writers who have pointed this out, and to get this in the best perspective, please read ' Brahmanda SrishTi Vignaanam', and 'Maanava SrishTi vignaanam' by Sri Kota Venkataachalam garu.

  

The fallacy amongst us, the western educated 'elite', is that if there is something we don't understand, it is a falsity. We do not take a child's view in accepting his parent's injunction to not do something wrong without questioning. Or to accept something without questioning until we figure out why. To Dr. Kaul, the big numbers you quote are all correct; I have talked to several pandits who accept Mayasura's timelines as correct. For our western timeline conditioned brains, such large numbers are anathema. So we completely reject such concept saying, 'No! It can't be!'. What if we start turning the argument upside down? We 'know' that a number of geographical references given in Ramayana are all still valid today. Not just place names, but features like rivers, forests, mountains, hills, etc. How is this possible across a million years? Or even 10000 years? We forget that ours is an integral society in which all sciences were intermingled with 'religion' (hate the word!) and vice versa. We forget that we hard coded longevity into our vedas by CRC and weaving techniques so even today they are recited in the same way for more than 10,000 or more years. We refuse to recognize this is as a science and technique in creating long lasting treatises, irrespective of the changes occurring in the society around. Since the practice does not exist in the west and hence our education system, we feel the need to scrap the knowledge contained therein and start applying the western point of view to everything. So we need to have archeological evidence from a million years ago to justify what is being said in Ramayana. We do not accept that the Shiva Lingam established by Rama as an atonement for the Brahmahatya (killing Ravana) is a proof of Rama's existence. After all, the shiva lingam exists today! In fact, the 'extreme' logic created by our Rishis is the one that scares us. "I can't believe it, so I have to not only reject it, but falsify it. ". We are so loathe of Oral tradition that we refuse to believe that Veda Pandits learn an anuvaakam with one listening and one recitation.

  

We have suffered from Westerners in this regard, do we also need to add to the misery?

  

Now to Dr. Mishra's comment: You say you want to convey to young minds the creativity of Indian story tellers. I respectfully submit that Ramayana is then a wrong subject for you to choose. You are going to corrupt entire generations of people who will read such stories and determine that Ramayana is nothing but a story. A whimsical one, at that. And you claim immunity because you live in a distant land trying to keep Indian story telling flag flying. Let me tell you that I live in the San Francisco bay area in California, have been here for a few decades, have brought up three children here, and have narrated Ramayanam, Bharatam, and Bhagavatam to my children. There is no diffiiculty if you follow logic. Children will accept. As they grow, they will have different questions, which you must be prepared to answer. Lack of such preparation on our part is not an excuse to distort our puranaas. The extreme logic of Sanskrit and puranas needs to be examined and marvelled at. As far as story telling goes, why don't you ask the question: what enabled Hanuman to fly? He was just a monkey, after all! Monkeys don't fly, so how did Hanuman manage to do that for a distance of 100 yojanas? Instead of dismissing that there were flying machines in Treta Yuga, why don't we ask ourselves what kind of fuel did they could have used? New and exciting research projects would ensue.

  

I probably got a bit carried away above. My goal is not to harangue either of you. No offence meant by me. The fund of knowledge we have is to be treasured and used. We lost a lot of useful literature that might have answered a lot of these questions because of the wilful destruction by Mughals. But we have institutional knowledge in all of us so we can recreate most of it back, if only we apply ourselves.

  

Best Regards,

Krishna Kumar Pillalamarri
