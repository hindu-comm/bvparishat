Dear Sri Pillaramarri,

While I respect your opinion, I have to differ in the methodology of education.

My goal is to make children be creative writers like Valmiki was. I may not succeed!

It is just a thought experiment, not religious. Valmiki is my model and not Ramayana.

I wrote several blogs on the topic some five years back when I started.

The website (to be released) will clarify it.  

I do admire your parenting and support to your children.

Thank you.  

BM
