Dear Dr. Bijoy Misra,

Jai Shri Ram!

I feel really honoured on seeing your offer that I must "volunteer to teach a 9th grade class and interact with the students".

I pondered on your kind suggestion and I wish I could accept the same.

Since I am totally preoccupied with streamlining the derailed Vedic/Hindu calendar, which is a very thankless and arduous job, I am not left with much time to spare for other things.

I will, therefore, not be able to do any justice either to the students or to the subject that I would be supposed to interact about.

Regarding your views about सत्यम् yes, it is not frozen in books or voices.ंंI can only hope that it reveals itself gradually to me even in an asymptomatic manner!

Thank you onceagain for your kind offer.

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!

Avtar Krishan Kaul
