Dear Shri Pillalamarri,

Jai Shri Ram!

Many thanks for your response.

First of all, like you, I too am no 'Doctor' but just an ordinary citizen of India i.e Bharat!

\< the big numbers you quote are all correct; I have talked to several pandits who accept Mayasura's timelines as correct. For our western timeline conditioned brains, such large numbers are anathema. So we completely rejectsuch concept saying, 'No! It can't be!'. What if we start turning the argument upside down?\>

Ihave never been to a "public" (eh!?)---is it really public, I wonder!---school---much less to an overseas country---but studied in government schools/colleges in Srinagar, Kashmir. They were known as "*chungi schools*" in local jargon.

I was born and brought up in a very orthodox family of Kashmiri Pandits where horoscope matching was/is a must for a boy and girl to be tied in a wedlock. *Sade Sati* and *Kalasarpa dosha* etc. were/are dreaded more than a snake bite!

My grandfather was a scholar of Siddhanta jyotisha and people would flock to him for astrological consultations! I inherited a sort of addiction to predictive astrology from him and whenever a new annual panchanga was received in the home, the first thing I would do was to see my "*Rashi-phal*"! 

So you can say that I have a more superstition and fad conditioned brain than "western timeline conditioned brains".

Now to the brass tacks:

The Surya Siddhanta that was around at the time of Vaahamhira in sixth century AD is/was a work of early centuries of CE compiled by some astronomer/s who gave arbitrary planetary orbital elements for millions of years!

The best-fit of mean planetary longitudes of the SS with the mean planetary longitudes of modern astronomy is Shaka 444 i.e. 522 AD.

And that is why Munjal of tenth century AD has advised in his *Laghumanasa t*o make *beeja* corrections of one arc minute per year from Shaka 444 for making them tally with the actual mean longitudes!

The present SS is supposed to have been compiled by Latadeva as per Alberuni whereas nothing is known about the compiler/s of the earlier SS of the Pancha Siddhantika. (Attachment Latadeva-SS)

*So the first and foremost thing that we have to bear in mind is that Maya Mahasura is a fictitious figure who has been taking us for a ride over the last about 2000 years by claiming that he was a "messenger of Surya Bhagwan" to reveal planetary knowledge to ordinary mortals of Bharata-varsha about twenty lakhs of years back!*

*And we have fallen hook, line and sinker for the same!*

How arbitrary and meaningless the longitudes of the SS are will be clear from the following attachments:

1. Kali0--longtds.: In this document, we find that the mean longitudes of planets of the SS, both old i.e. the Pancha-Siddhantika and CSS i.e the current Surya Siddhanta were really zero at the time of the so called *Kaliyuga arambha* i.e Ujjain mean time mean midnight of February 17/18, 3102 BCE, for Ujjain.

But they are away by light years from the actual longitudes as on that date, whether the so called sayana or the so called nirayana!

2. Attachment Shaka-444: This is the paper indicating mean longitudes of planets of the SS, old as well as current, vis-a-vis mean longitudes as per modern astronomy for 522 AD. There is not much difference between the SS longitudes and modern astronomy longitudes--that too so called sayana. It means that the planetary longitudes calculated from the SS a century plus or minus to Shaka 444 was the only period when they could tally with the actual longitudes to a great extend.

3. Attachment 150619longtds. Mean longitudes of the SS for today i.e. June 15, 2019 vis-a-vis modern astronomy!

There is again a difference of heaven and earth between the mean longitudes of the SS as compared to modern astronomy! The former are neither tropical nor sidereal! Just meaningless longitudes!

So there is neither anything sacrosanct about the SS nor divine. On the other hand, it is a concoction that has been palmed on us the unsuspecting and gullible Hindus of Bhaatavarsha!

Regarding the late Pandit Kota Venakatachalam's books, I have read almost all of them.

He has said exactly the same thing as my grandfather would say and even what I believed myself till a few decades back. However, since there were no computers around then much less the internet in 1950s, so neither my grandpa nor Pandit Venkatachelam had any means to verify the statements of the so called *Maya Mahasura.*

Now that the very fundamental arguments of the SS are quite baseless, it means that the very foundation stone of the mind-boggling superstructure of Chaturyuga viz. the Kaliyuga itself has absolutely no basis.

As the duration of *maha-yugas* and *kalpas* etc. is a derivative of the same they are anything but factual.

As a further confirmation of the faux-pas of the SS being a "divine" work, we find a lot of material having been plagiarizedby "Narada Rishi" in his Narada Purana without any compunction, much less any acknowledgement. On the other hand, "Narada Rishi" claims those verses to have been "revealed by Brahmaji Himself"!

How the SS has befuddled the common Hindu will be clear from the attachment "Kaundinyayana-1" --- a detailed analysis of the SS etc. by Acharya Shivraj Kaundinyaya, while writing a commentary on the "Vedanga Jyotisham of Acharya Lagadha! He has declared unequivocally that to consider the SS a divine work is nothing but आत्म वँचना a self deception.

Btw, when one of my relatives, who was about 75 then, was informed about NeilArmstrong having landed at the moon in July 1966, he was very skeptical and had said that it was some jugglery conjured by America to make a fool of us since the sun would definitely reduce anybody to ashes if he/she tried to cross it's paths!

Sometimes I wonder myself as to whether my *"janma kaleena chandrama*" includes all the debris that the satellites have left there on the moon!

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!
