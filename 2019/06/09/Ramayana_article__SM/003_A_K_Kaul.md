  Jai Shri Ram!

Our Rishis compiled historical knowledge into the puranas, along with multi-disciplinary information in the puranas for easy access by masses. Thus, we find several sciences very well covered, specially in Ramayana. You probably know more about all the sciences covered in Ramayana. The entire lineage of Ikshvaaku vamsam is listed which enables us to trace back the age of Treta Yuga kings.

There is actually a lot of confusion about the starting dates as well as the duration of the four yugas!

The well known astronomer Aryabhata, who is supposed to have "discovered" the starting date of Kaliyuga was of the view that a Chaturyuga/Mahayuga consists of 4320000 years and each yuga has a duration of 108000 years. According to the same Aryabhata, the Kaliyuga in which we are supposed to be living, started at 6 a.m. (Ujjain meantime) on February 18, 3102 BCE, at Ujjain.

Thus if we go by Aryabhata yugas, Bhagwan Ram is supposed to have Incarnated 3101 plus 2019 years of the presentKaliyuga plus 1080000 years of Dwaparayuga i.e. more than 1085139 years back.

On the other hand, Maya Mahasura, the father-in-law of the "not so famous" Rakshasa king Ravana, who is supposed to have compiled the Surya Siddhanta was of the view that though a Chaturyuga consists of 4320000 years but the different yugas have a duration of 1:2:3:4 i..e Kaliyuga has 432000 years, Dwapara Yuga 864000 years, Treta Yuga 1296000 years and Kritayuga 1728000 years. According to him Kaliyuga did not start at 6 a.m. on February 18, 3102 BCE, but on the midnight (Ujjain meantime)of February 17/18, 3102 BCE at Ujjain.

Thus we can say that Maya Mahasura made his Kaliyuga start earlier by six hours than the Aryabhata Kaliyuga!

And it is the same "Maya Mahasura" Kaliyuga that is being shown by Panchanga makers, including the Rashtriya Panchnaga in their Panchangas!

So according to Maya Mahasura the divine Incarnation of Bhagwan Ram who is supposed to have killed his son-in-law was around 5120 years of Kaliyuga plus 864000 years of Dwapara Yuga i.e. 869120 years back. So "Maya-Mahasua" Bhagwan Ram had Incarnated earlier by more than two lakhs of years earlierthan Aryabhata Bhagwan Ram!

The Puranas and the Manusmriti etc. seem to be agreeing with Maya-Mahasura instead of Aryabhata about the duration of yugas, as will be evident from the attachment Mahayuga-yuga!

In any case, it is really a very very distant past, whether it is eight lakhs of years or ten lakhs of years back and to presume that Bhagwean Ram Incarnated so long ago is itself very disturbing. It is not supported by either astronomy or archaeology or geology orby any other branch of science.

It is also mind boggling to think that Aadi Kavi Valmiki had composed his Aadi Kavya viz. Valmiki Ramayana about eight/ten lakhs of years back and it survived in a pristine condition for such a long period.

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!

Avtar Krishen Kaul
