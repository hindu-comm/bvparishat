Dear Shri Kaul,

  

The makara Sankraanti celebration to me appears more as a festival that can be done after the crops have reached farmers' homes. This is the start of the season of plenty in an age when everything was dependent on rains and raising crops was a great part of economic activity. I don't believe we need to worry too much on that score. I am thinking more of Bhishma waiting for Uttaraayana so he can give up his physical body. How did he calculate uttaraayana's arrival? According to your calculation or SS?

  

This may be an easier way to prove the efficacy of either method, isn't it?

  

Best Regards,

  

Krishna Kumar Pillalamarri
