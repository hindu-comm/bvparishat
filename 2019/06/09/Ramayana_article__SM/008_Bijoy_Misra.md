Dear Dr Kaul,

I beg you to volunteer to teach a 9th grade class and interact with the students.

You would come out with a definition of सत्यम्

The latter is not written in books, it is what we perceive and what we can prove.

In Indian culture, सत्यम् reveals itself gradually, it is not frozen in books or voices.

Let सत्यम् be given its nature being asymptotic, yet to be realized.

So is my humble submission.

Best regards,

BM
