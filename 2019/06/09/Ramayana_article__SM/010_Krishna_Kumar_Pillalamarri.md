Dear Sri Kaul,

  

Thank you very much for your detailed explanation of why Mayasura's siddhantas and timelines do not work. Your logic and the pramanas you gave seem to be good, though I do not have enough expertise to counter readily. I will take time to go through a bit more carefully and try to come backto you. Hopefully I am able to talk to a couple of people, as well. In the meantime, best regards to you.

  

Regards,

  

Krishna Kumar Pillalamarri
