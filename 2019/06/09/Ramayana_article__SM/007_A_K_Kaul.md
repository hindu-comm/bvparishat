Dear Dr. Bijoy Misra,

Jai Shri Ram!

\<Respectfully I have to submit that we have to change our language to contain

the knowledge that has been gathered since Aryabhatta.\>

Manu the Law Giver has said

सत्यं ब्रूयात् प्रियं ब्रूयात्, न ब्रूयात् सत्यमप्रियम् \|\|

प्रियं च नानृतं ब्रूयात् , एष धर्मः सनातनः\|\|

I find it next to impossible to discuss such सत्यं as is liked by (palatable to!) everybody! As such, most of the time I just keep quiet!

Regarding ''the knowledge that has been gathered since Aryabhata" it is quite strange that even he has been dubbed as मूर्खो वा पिशाचो वा by Brahmagupta of seventh century AD for having claimed that the earth was not stationary but had a rotation/revolution of its own!
Bhaskaracharya-II of 12th century also did not agree with Aryabhata! It was an अप्रिय सत्यं for Brahmagupta as well as Bhaskaracharya!!

Even in the fag end of twentieth century, the last Siddhantic astronomer of India, viz. Samanta Chandreshaekhar (also known as Pathani Samanta) had to say in his Siddhanta Darpana that the earth was flat and did not move, but the sun revolved around it! (Pl. see attachments SD1 and SD2).

Pathani Samant was sure that if the earth had a revolution/rotation of its own, the Surya Siddhanta would certainly have said about the same!

\<Please check if we can take this to be included in a High School curriculum.>

I have kept the सत्यं before you. It is for you to decide what you want to do with the same!

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!

Avta Krishen Kaul
