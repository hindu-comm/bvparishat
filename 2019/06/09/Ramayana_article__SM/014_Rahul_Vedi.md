Dear Krishna Kumaravarya

You are right in stating that the auspicious occasion is interpreted as a marker for agricultural calendar.

This may be an oversimplification of a celestial event as determined by Jyotish (explained in the text of SS and several other jyotish texts)

  

The Earth takes an elliptical path around the surya at on of the focus.

Makara samkranti (thai masa pongal) is time when the position of the Earth is at its closest distance from the surya.

At this time, it (she) is also moving at its fastest speed - nearly 63 minutes of angle per day as compared to the karkata samkranti when the motion is almost 57 minutes of angle. (the speed being measured in the angular path traced by earth or as observed surya .

  

Celestially, these two facts (a) closest to surya and (b) fastest motion are the special characteristics of the special occasion of makara samkranti.

  

There are implications of these (combined with the fact that the axis of earth rotation) causes winter in the north hemisphere and teh seasons influencing agriculture.

The axis of earth's rotation also makes the apparent northward motion from this day.

  

SS and other jyotish texts have this motion (actually of earth - viewed apparent motion of the Sun) with particular references to the four major points in the elliptical path - the two equinoxes and two solstices)

  

regards

Rahul
