Dear Shree Bijoy Mishra,

  

It is a beautiful effort, producing English articles on Sundarakanda. While I do not intend to take away anything from your effort, I have a fundamental disagreement in the way you are treating Ramayana in producing the articles. Please note, I am not writing this note to troll you or create unnecessary controversy. But this is a point that needs to be debated and examined.

  

All puranas in Samskrita vaangmayam are charitras. ( I somehow dislike the word History, though that might be useful). They are 'Itihasas, meaning ' इति+ह+ आसम् '. What you are doing is treating Ramayana as a story produced by Valmiki. This leads you to say that, since the story at that time needs an elder statesman to either exhort Hanumaan or interpret his 'roar' while returning, Valmiki introduced a character named Jaambavaan. My personal view point is that this is an abhorrent way of treating the important 'character' of Jambavanta who lived through Treta Yuga and into Dwapara Yuga. The antecedents of Jambavanta are also explained to us for reference purposes.

  

Our Rishis compiled historical knowledge into the puranas, along with multi-disciplinary information in the puranas for easy access by masses. Thus, we find several sciences very well covered, specially in Ramayana. You probably know more about all the sciences covered in Ramayana. The entire lineage of Ikshvaaku vamsam is listed which enables us to trace back the age of Treta Yuga kings. Sri Kota Venkatachalam, a renowned scholar who took Sanyaasaasramam in 1957 to become Jagadguru Sankaracharya of Abhinava Virupaksha Peetham, writes how in each of the puranas correct history is inscribed. ('The Plot in Indian Chronology' 1952, published by KV Historical Research Institute, Besant Nagar, Vijayawada, Andhra Pradesh. He was the first one to establish the age of Mahabharata war, I believe). That this was ignored by Indian, British and European historians who distorted our puranas is a different story.

  

Along with this, I would like to submit a question mark on whether Hanuman was a monkey. This is a term you use in your article. In Ramayana, I don't see the term 'markaTa' - मर्कट - used as much as वानर . The term वानर may be perhaps read as नरः वा, leading us to believe that it is an intermediate development stage between the apes becoming humans, wherein some of them like Hanuman, Sugriva and Vali are almost close to Humans in development. This perhaps describes the various great qualities Hanuman had. similar attributes perhaps were in other forms of animals, too, explaining Jambavanta's erudition.

  

We are ready to denounce Sheldon Pollock about his lack of 'Shraddha' in treatment of Ramayana. While your effort is eminently laudable, and I do not draw any parallels to his work, should we not write these translations, with the Shraddha that is demanded by Ramayana?

  

Best Regards,
