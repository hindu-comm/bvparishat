Dear Shri Pillalamarri,

JAi Shri Ram!

Thank you for your response.

Glad to note that you will be talking to a couple of people about the anomalies in the SS.

I would also request you to kindly try to find out from them that in spite of our faith in and respect for the SS, why have we been (and still are) celebrating Pongal/Makar Sankranti etc. about 24 days after the Uttarayana (Winter Solstice) and Karata Sankranti after 24 days of Dakshinayan and so on when the same SS has advised

भानोर्मकर सँक्रान्तेः षण्मासाः उत्तरायणम्

कर्क्यादेस्तथैव स्यात् षण्मासाः दक्षिणायम्

I.e. the six months of Uttarayan start when the sun enters Makara Rashi and six months of Dakshinayan start when the sun enters Karata Rashi and so on.

In short we are celebrating all our festivals and muhurtas against the injunctions of the same SS on the basis of which we are prepared to believe that Maya Mahasura was around 20 lakhs of years back.

If the late Shri Venkatachelam were around today I would certainly put this question to him also!

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!

Avtar Krishan Kaul
