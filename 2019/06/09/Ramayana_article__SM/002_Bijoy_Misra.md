Dear Dr Pillalamarri,

I appreciate your reading the article and commenting on it. My intent has been to present Valmiki and the science of poetics.

The audience I believe is the future youth who would be creative, create new material, new poetry and maintain the tradition of

Indian story telling. The idea is to develop the thoughts through the series as much analytically as one can.

The articles are essays in the form of story-telling. They are supposed to present the art of weaving legends, Each piece is  

expected to be an independent story to be shared in a classroom or by a mother to a child anywhere in the world.  

The series possibly now has thirty essays. Let me request you kindly read a few more of the essays and advise if the above

intent is being followed. The potential child is a world citizen and hopefully would understand that human understanding of

values and duty have developed through poets and storytellers who happened to live in India.

As you may see, I conceive the project to present Valmiki's Ramayana as a treasure of world literature, educational to the

mankind as the literary book of story-telling. The Ramayana musical to explore drama is another part of the same effort.

I had shared the link an earlier post
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rArC2BDCyi8&t=9s>  

These are small efforts from a distant land to celebrate the vast cultural tradition that India presents to the world. I do accept

my limitations though I ruminate on the story to tell a ten-year old somewhere in an airport.  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra

  

PS. A website on the effort is in preparation and would go public in a month.
