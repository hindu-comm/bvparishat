Pranam to all

  

Are there any works (ancient or modern) that specifically are on the topic ofपुरुषार्थ?

  

I see references toपुरुषार्थ in the epics (Ramayana, MBh) and the Puranas, but has this topic been treated at length by any scholar or commentator in the past or recently?

  

Any inputs would be much appreciated.  

  

  

kind regards

Harsha
