Pranam to all,

  

I have always harboured a suspicion that the original purushartha was not chaturvarga but trivarga (dharma, artha and kama). Moksha, in my view, was tagged later on to the framework. Perhaps, even a buddhist influence is discernible, prima facie.

  

I have not been able to trace this point easily, and I am not sure if this is even the right one.

  

Any guidance or inputs on this point would be very helpful for me and gratefully received.

  

kind regards

Harsha
