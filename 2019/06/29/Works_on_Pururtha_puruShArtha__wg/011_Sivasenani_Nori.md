I understand where you are coming from. Let me offer a few remarks based on my understanding.

  

I am a conservative in the sense that my first preference is the traditional explanation; only when the traditional explanation does not hold in the face of new facts or arguments, should an alternative be considered. Why? Siddhanta positions are arrived at after a lot of deliberation, discussion and argumentation and the participants, by all accounts we have, are very sharp and not inferior to the present-day participants.

  

In this case the traditional explanation is like this. Only trivarga is the subject matter of almost all activities of life, because the maximum part of life is spent in the first three ashramas. For example vivaha mantras include only 'धर्मे नातिचरामि, अर्थे नातिचरामि, कामे नातिचरामि, ' not moksha. The very name of Upanishads, rahasyam (secret), substantiates that. Then, it is no surprise we mostly find discussion of dharma, artha and kama only in literature.

  

All the darshanas on the other hand clearly mention moksha as their objective - though the name used might differ.

  

It is reasonable to assume that Buddhism took the concepts of sanatana dharma (damaa, karma, nibbana, dhyana, indriya nigraha etc.) and tried to establish them without having to admit the validity of Vedas, as it clearly is a reaction to Sanatana Dharma. So the main contribution of Buddhism is to the analytical method. Pre-Buddhism, we see more of conclusions; post-Buddhism, we see more of reasoning to support the conclusions, a systematic treatment of the subject etc.

  

One more point to consider is that any original contribution would have been celebrated and well-documented. Let us take an example - when Islam supplanted the polytheism of Arabs, the contributions of Islam, namely one God and single brotherhood, are celebrated and well-documented. In what little I have read of Buddhism, the key difference seems to be not so much in the way of life but that the same kind of life can be continued (just ponder: in what way are the practical aspects of Buddhism different from Sanatana Dharma? Say, the ashTaangamaarga or the aaryasatyaani) without the need to believe in God or Vedas, not that Buddhism gives one nirvana whereas the Sanatana Dharma would trap one in an eternal cycle of birth and death.
