Among traditional compilations:

Sayanacharya's compilation 'Purusarthasudhanidhi' ed by T Chandrasekharana. Madras Government Oriental Manuscript Series No. 39 (1955)

Vishnu Bhatta (s/o Ramakrishnabhatta), Purusarthachintamani, published in 1927 by Nirnayasagar Press

Chaturvargasamgraha by Kshemendra, Hamsa Prakashan (Jaipur) published in 2004 with a Hindi translation

  

Sayana's work is based in the Puranic narratives.

  

As for modern works:

Chakrabarti, Samiran Chandra. 2000. *The Concept of Purusārthas*. Maharshi Sandipani Rashtriya Ved Vidya Pratishthan: Ujjain

Danielou, Alain. 1993. *Virtue, Success, Pleasure and Liberation – The Four Aims of Life in the Tradition of India*. Inner Traditions International. Rochester (Vermont, USA)

Mehta, J. M. 2006. *Four Objectives of Human Life*. Pustak Mahal: Delhi

Prasad, Rajendra. 2008. A *Conceptual-Analytic Study of Classical Indian Philosophy of Morals*. Center for Studies in Civilizations (Concept Publishing Company): New Delhi

Stryker, Rod. 2011. *The Four Desires*. Delacorte Press: New York

Tripathi, Premvallabh. *Purushārtha-Chatushtaya*. Anandakaanana Press: Varanasi (in Hindi and Sanskrit)

  

I used the attached compilation that I wrote several years back for my own teaching purposes. It might not meet the 'scholarly' criteria but serves its intended pedagogical purpose well.

  

Regards,
