What, pray, are the grounds for such suspicion? I know that you are only exploring and have not arrived at a conclusion, but what could be the trigger for such a thought?

  

One, I see, could be the thought that Upanishad were compiled as a reaction to Buddhism. They are the Moksha Sastra and therefore the very purushartha was due to Buddhism. However, even without contending the paurusheyatva of Upansihads (not proven till now by those who propose human authorship), there is no basis for contemporaneity of Buddhism and Upansihads beyond speculation and an almost childish guess along the lines of "the change in language must have taken about 200 years" (No systematic study of the so-called language changes was done to prove that guess even after 150 years).

  

Are there other triggers?

  

Regards
