"Can he be Brahma? We do not see four faces; can he be Vishnu? He does not have four hands; can he be Shiva? No oddness of the eyes is observed. Having thus argued for a long time, the learned have come to the conclusion that Vidyaranya is verily the Supreme Light Incarnate. (Sringeri Plate of Harihara II May 1386)"

  

The above quote (sourced from the website-<https://www.sringeri.net/jagadgurus/sri-vidyaranya/biography>) is rather interesting because the quote seems a modified version of that applied to Shri Veda Vyasa from the bhArata sAvitri.
