Dear Dr. Dhaval Patel,

  

There is a very good quality scan of the second volume of Keśavasvāmin's work on [archive.org](http://archive.org):

<https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.283537>

  

Of volume 1 there seems to be only a scan of lesser quality; still at first glance most of the visarga-s and

anusvāra-s are perhaps visible:

A better scan of volume 1 would certainly be nice to have.

  

Of Nānārthaśabdakoṣa a.k.a.Medinikośa/Medinīkośa there are various editions. A good enough (I think)

quality scan of a 1940 Chowkhamba edition is available on [archive.org](http://archive.org):

Is there a specific edition that you prefer?

  

With appreciation for your work on digitizing Sanskrit lexical works, and best regards,

  

Harunaga Isaacson
