Dear scholars,

Would anyone of you kindly guide me to a decent quality scans of the following works please -

1\. Nānārthārṇavasaṅkṣepa of Keśavasvāmin

2\. Nānārthaśabdakoṣa of Medinikara.

  

I have scans probably gathered from [archive.org](http://archive.org) which are not legible. Visarga, anusvāra etc are not visible at places.
