Dear All,

  

Just wanted to request if someone from the group has access to the sanskrit text of a book called Alankar Kaustubha and can share the text with me.

  

I searched online and came across the below link, however, the entire sanskrit text is not there (only text of 3 kirans are there out of the total 10 kirans)

  

<https://grantha.jiva.org/index.php?show=category&c_no=4>

  

will be great to have just the sanskrit text of all of the kirans.  

  

thanks

regards

vikas
