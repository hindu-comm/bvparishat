I saw the following on the web, mentioned as an English translation of the 17th śloka from the Goḷa pāda of āryabhaṭīya of āryabhaṭa: “*Gola 17: The gods (at the north pole) see the sun after sunrise for half a solar year; so do the demons (at the south pole). Those living on the moon see the sun for half a lunar month; the humans here see it for half a civil day*.”

We know that āryabhaṭa knew about earth’s west to east rotation and its revolution around the sun. But the above śloka would imply that he also knew about the tilt of earth’s axis of rotation relative to the plane of its revolution around the sun. Without knowing about the tilt, he could not have mentioned the day and night at the poles, each of half a solar year duration.

If anyone has the original Sanskrit āryabhaṭīya, can they kindly check if this is indeed the 17^(th) śloka from the Goḷa pāda? Could they also provide the original Sanskrit śloka and its literal meaning in English?
