Dear Shri Warrier,

Jai Shri Ram!

We find a similar mention of a day of six months and a night of six months in the 67th shlok of Bhugoladyaya of the Surya Siddhanta.

The attachment is from the Hindi translation of Mahavir Prasad Srivastav, published from Allahabad.

Btw, the Aryabhatiya as well as the SS are available in pdf format.

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!

Avtar Krishan Kaul
