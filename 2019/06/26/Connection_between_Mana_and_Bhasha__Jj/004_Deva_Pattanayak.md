Dear Avayankara_ji

Namaste and thank you for the translation. My mind is processing what Dr. Bohm has said. Paraphrasing or the way I think is this: The processes that is going on inside the mind can not be described classically ie deterministically. Mind cannot utter an isolated word only- one word is always associated with many words. Mana is asthira.

That Mana operates in the quantum way(non-deterministic and intrinsically uncontrollable ( abodha ?) and not in a classical way has significant implications. It leads to progress, innovation and improvisation and ultimately to evolution of better and better intellect( dhi? and towards higher and higher understanding of nature.

So how deterministic are the four types of Vaks ?

The real heading of a real academic discussion should be:
Hypothesis_1. Quantum Mechanical Axioms are needed to understand Mind.

I agree with you that Mana and Vak is more appropriate than mana and bhasha.

So has there been more "Vislashana"(analysis) or "alochana"(discussion) in the Shastras about the nature and characteristics like the "ashthirata" of mana and its resulting influence on Vak.

Regards

Devanarayan
