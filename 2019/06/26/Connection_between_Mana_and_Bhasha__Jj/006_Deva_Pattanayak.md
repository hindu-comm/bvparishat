Dear Abhyankar,

Interesting that I find what I started on an intuition that in order for progress to happen a thought can not be precise and completely controllable by mind, because then progress will depend on thought of others which are better than one's own.

If however, our thought process has the intrinsic capability of indeterminacy as in quantum theory, then mind and language therefore can come up with new concepts.

I happened to see a book entitled " The mystery of matter" by Jennifer Trusted, Mcmillan Press, Great Britain, 1999.

The book is very fascinating and reads well. the author does not talk about concepts in the Vedas and Shastras and limits herself to western philosophers and scientists. I do not blame the author,because it is not that easy to master the Vedas and Upanishads etc.

Here is an excerpt in the book attributed to Physicist Bohr

" In Bohr's view, the indeterminism of quantum mechanics has its origin in the unavoidable "rupture" of description ..."

The point being until one observes nothing is certain and after observation the element being observed collapses to the state of the element being observed- this is related to the famous Schrodinger's cat being alive or dead paradox.

I am trying here to what extent these type of quantum behavior of nature is described in Sanskrit . The language of quantum theory is axiomatic and mathematics. May be we need a Sanskrutanta language just like Vedanta.

Regards

Devanarayan
