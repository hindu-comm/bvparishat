नमस्ते देवनारायण-वर्य !

When saying "... mind and language therefore can come up with new concepts...." you seem to have substituted the word "language" in place of Bhasha. This substitution by you may be, to come close to Vaak.

I think "thought process" is more the Vaak, than "language".

The thought process is active primarily in two mental states जागृती and स्वप्नावस्था.

The thought process sort of becomes placid in सुषुप्ति.

Complete calmness is in तुर्यावस्था.

If one were to plot a graph of theses four states on X-axis and activity level of the mind on the Y-axis, one may plot it as an hyperbola, but meeting the X-axis in the तुर्यावस्था.

It may appear to be asymptotic in सुषुप्ति.

That is the reason for my saying the curve to be hyperbolic.

As such the hyperbola has in it the element of indeterminism in quantum theory.

I must confess that I am a very ordinary person and I live in only जागृती and स्वप्नावस्था.

My knowledge of सुषुप्ति and तुर्यावस्था is only bookish.

But I have no hesitation in acknowledging that सुषुप्ति and तुर्यावस्था ought to be very much possible.

I would NOT consider them to be indeterminate.

I would hence contend that concepts of indeterminism as in quantum theory need not and should not be applied to study of मनस् and वाक्.

I would more go by what श्रीकृष्णभगवान् says in अभ्यासेन तु कौन्तेय वैराग्येण च गृह्यते (गीता 6'35).

The extent on X-axis \<when the curve will become asymptotic in सुषुप्ति and will meet the X-axis (Y=0) in तुर्यावस्था>

that extent will very from person to person and may happen across even many births.

बहूनां जन्मनामन्ते ज्ञानवान् मां प्रपद्यते (7'19)

As advised by श्रीकृष्णभगवान्the extent onX-axis will depend upon the quality and intensity of both अभ्यास and वैराग्य, what one would practice.
