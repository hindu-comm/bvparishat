Dear Korada_ji

  

Thank you very much for your post for which I am grateful. It will take me some time to fully understand your post.

  

I was attending the 50th convention of the Odisha Society of the Americas in Atlantic City . New Jersey, USA.

The fascinating Odissi dances and the rendering of human emotions that cause similar feelings in the audience is an amazing capability of humans. How this happens in physical terms is not well understood by scientists, although many famous people are engaged. Unfortunately, they do not have a good and clear understanding of the eastern knowledge over thousands of years.

My attempt here is to use bvparishat platform to come up with a new and our own summary of what has been known by our forefathers which are available in the writings of the Shastras. Obviously the task is enormous, but I think we will make progress.

Intuitively I have been thinking that it will not be possible classically to explain what and how our mind thinks and makes sense of the nature using all the information available through our sensory organs. My reason being the mind can think of things immediately which are mundane as the cow is chewing grass to the almost infinite extent of the universe. Most importantly mind uses very little energy, so little that in that realm physicist have proven that classical theory is not adequate and one has to take recourse to quantum theory. Also the neural circuitry of the brain consists of exquisitely arranged molecules, so small that their numbers are counted in terms of \~10 ^23 atoms and molecules in few grams of the brain matter. The point is we are talking of Sukhmati Sukhma and very very large numbers. I remember Gita where it is said that many universes are arising out of each one of your hair follicles. Also Arjun was told that he can not see it by his own eyes, he needs divine sight which was given to Arjun by Shri Krishna. That clearly implies that mana and life processes are not classical but beyond it. I am of the opinion that if we ask specific questions with an objective of understanding what is described such as what is the difference between sthula and sukhma, human and divine eyes etc, we may find some ways to understand the mind body connection or relationship. Bohm had made a very important point that it is probably not possible to think of only one word and avoiding all the associated words with that. One corollary question that comes to my mind is how the associated words are tagged to a single word.

I must stop here and take some time to go over your reply and understand it in my own way. My request to all is to please stay focussed on the above mentioned quote of Bohm.

  

With best regards

Devanarayan

  

ps; Any theory such as quantum theory must explain the classical theory when it is applicable- this is known as the correspondence principle.
