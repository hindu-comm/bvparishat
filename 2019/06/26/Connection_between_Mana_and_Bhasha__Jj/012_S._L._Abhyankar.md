नमस्ते श्रीमन् प्रद्युम्नवर्य !

In your response to Mr. देवनारायण पट्टनायक, you have commented about Bohm's analogies.

On the point of analogies explaining how the mind works, comes to mind

इन्द्रियाणां हि चरतां यन्मनोऽनुविधीयते \|

तदस्य हरति प्रज्ञां वायुर्नावमिवाम्भसि (गीता 2'67)

I would think that here, the sets off analogous things उपमेयानि\<\>उपमानानिare

उपमेयानि - (1) अस्य यतेः(2) यदि (यदा वा) इन्द्रियाणि चरन्ति (3) अनुविधीयन् मनः (4) प्रज्ञां (5) हरति

उपमानानि - (1) नाविकस्य (2) नावम् (3) वायुः (4) अम्भसि (5) हरति

Hereउपमेयानि and उपमानानिare analogous, becauseहरतिthe action and the resultant effect are common.

In one of his notes,Mr. देवनारायण पट्टनायक also had mentioned about the concept of "correspondence" in Physics.

I have identified above by numbers the elements in bothउपमेयानि and उपमानानि, so as to bring out the beautiful one-to-one "correspondence".

Actually the principle of correspondence is mandatory in every अर्थालङ्कार. Absence of correspondence will make theअर्थालङ्कार then and there अर्थहीन.

See how perfect the correspondence here, betweenउपमेयानि and उपमानानि is; not just poetically beautiful, but very much scientifically correct !

  

This श्लोक connects up not onlyमनः andइन्द्रियाणिwhich are involved in the different phases of वाक्, but also connects upप्रज्ञा, which should not be allowed to suffer हरणम्,to bewavering or be susceptible to disturbance.

  

I guess thisश्लोकgives clarifications on not only the points raised byMr. देवनारायण पट्टनायक. about मनः and वाक् but also about the reactions unto the external influences sensed and reacted byइन्द्रियाणि and the importance ofप्रज्ञा (= intellect) remaining steadfast.

  

Thinking of elements involved and their momentums, the momentum of the wind may disturb, may cause change in the momentum of the boat, but should not cause any great change in the momentum of the waters. Thechange in the momentum of the waters may, if at all be only at the surface, superficial. Likewise,what is sensed and reacted by the organs may cause change in momentum of the organs and in turnअनुविधीयन्cause change in momentum ofthe mind मनः, but there should notbe any great change in the momentum of the intellectप्रज्ञा.

  

What a great verse ! There are other verses also in गीता, where one can find great one-to-one correspondence between उपमेयसर्वस्वम् and उपमानसर्वस्वम्. This verse appeals to be relevant here, because it tells about the mind, the organs, the pursuer (साधक or यति) and his intellect.
