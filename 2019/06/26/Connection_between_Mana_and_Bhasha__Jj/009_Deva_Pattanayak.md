Dear Abhyankar

There is a correspondence principle in physics that goes from classical to quantum. There is no direct way. Combining classical aspects of nature and quantum aspect of nature is not an easy task.

You have come up with very original interpretation of nature of mind and in a way body that holds it ( Dharayami kaya mono vakya- my way of thinking in Sanskrit - Body holds mind and speech),

I must stop here and plot your suggested function and consider the hyperbolic nature of it.

  

I will be busy the next few days- attending a 50 year get together of Odias in USA at the Atlantic City.

  

I hope others may comment if they like considering we are in a virtual "pathashala" with no constraints except a desire to learn from each other to add to Veda(knowledge).

  

Quantum theory as I mentioned is based on the language of mathematics ( ellipses and hyperbolas !) and connecting it with classical theoryhas not been successful although we know at one end ( sthula padartha) classical theory explains nature and at the other end( Sukhma padartha) quantum theory is necessary to explain nature.

With best regards

Devanarayan
