It has been mentioned that mana is asthira meaning it wonders, can not stay on one topic. Likewise it is impossible to just limit oneself to utter one word without a trail of related words in mind, as if the word that has gone out of the mouth will be followed by other words. the key point I am pondering is if one has complete control of the next word that follows. Obviously in the pralapa(delirium) state one utters words uncontrollably.

In the book by Bohm on quantum theory, I came across this statement.

"Similarly, part of the connotation of a word depends on the words it is associated with, and in a way that is not, in practice, completely predictable or controllable(especially in speech).In fact the analysis of language, as actually used into distinct elements with precisely defined relations between them is probably impossible"

The key question here is speech in the realm of quantum theory in the sense that it is not possible to stay on extremely precise thought

represented by a definite word without the influence of a coterie of related words.

Neurological aspect is such that brain uses a very miniscule amount of energy in the thought process that generates language where classical description is not applicable and quantum description is required.

Is there any thing in the Shastras that says things very similar to the above. I would be grateful to receive some help in finding the most relevant Shastra dealing with connection between mind and language at the level of utterance of language.
