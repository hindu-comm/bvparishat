"here there is difference of opinion between वेदान्तिन्-s and followers of न्याय-वैशेषिक -सांख्यादिदर्शन-s -- the former think that मनस् is not an इन्द्रियम् whereas the latter think that मनस् is an इन्द्रियम् । Panini defines इन्द्रियम् as the one by which one would know the existence of आत्मा --**’ इन्द्रियम् इन्द्रलिङ्गम्...’ पा सू 5-2-93**)"

So clearly there is a duality in the sense that mind or mana is matter (Indriya) or not matter. In Physics light can behave like a particle or like a wave. Einstein suggested that we use either of the interpretation to explain nature.

I now like to make a statement that some of the natural phenomena can only be explained by using quantum mechanics. Clearly that I can explain my self classically to consist of a large number of molecules which make my flesh and blood as well as my mind and all that I am at this time. I however can not say that to be true when I pass away that is when all those elements are burned to ashes. However I can not be sure if I also have another feature(atma or soul ) that I can not pinpoint while I am alive and of course I do not know when I am dead. But I know for sure that I was not in my present state before I was born. Probabilistically I can say ( using my buddhi that I can exist in two states one is my current living state ( eha loka) where due to all my sense organs ( Indriyas), I am able to perceive nature myway and in another state ( para loka) after my death. Clearly this duality between the two states I described one clearly material and the other non-material can not be disputed. The wave particle duality and the quantum behavior of nature including the entangled state of particles and waves have been scientifically described and observed.

As Bohm stated determinism( complete control through buddhi) may not always work and uncontrollable and indeterministic and unknowable states may very well exit non only in our mind ( mana) but are required to not only explain nature but its existence and evolution.

  

Like to thank Dr. Subrahmanyam for his excellent notes ( have not completely understood them) that has helped my understanding of life and death.
