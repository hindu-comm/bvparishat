नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

Bohm had made a very important point that it is probably not possible to think of only one word and avoiding all the associated words with that. One corollary question that comes to my mind is how the associated words are tagged to a single word.

                  ----- Vid Devanarayan

  

This aspect ' it is a group of words with the prerequisites , viz आकाङ्क्षा (mutual expectancy ) , योग्यता ( compatibility) and

आसत्ति / सन्निधि ( proximity ) , called वाक्यम् , only is the candidate that can render a complete unitary meaning ' had been discussed for
the umpteenth time here since 2009 .

Even if one employs a word --- where are you coming from ? hostel -- here the word ' hostel ' , in fact , is not a word -

rather it is an elliptical sentence -- the ellipses being - I am coming from . When there is shared knowledge , the speaker

would , for brevity , employ the minimum word/ s .

It was already a lengthy posting and therefore I did not touch this aspect - once you complete the posting then I shall

attempt other aspects with quotations from व्याकरणम् , मीमांसा , न्याय etc.
