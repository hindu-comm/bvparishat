Respected Sri. Sripada,

  

I stand corrected. I was wrong in my usage of the terms in my post and my intention not conveyed correctly.

  

I meant to say that Bohm's analogies should not be treated more than analogies, and that is no merit in saying that quantum mechanics dictates speech or thought just because it is possible to construct an analogy.

It would be akin to saying that winds and boats dictate sense organs and the mind because there exists an analogy.

  

Regards

Pradyumna
