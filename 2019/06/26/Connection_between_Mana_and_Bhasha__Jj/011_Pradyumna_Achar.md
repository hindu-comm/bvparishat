Respected Sri. Deva Pattanayak,

  

I searched Google for the phrase from your mail"part of the connotation of a word depends on" and went through a few links that refer to Bohm's work where this appears.

  

A particle's momentum and position cannot be both simultaneously and accurately observed, because of the Heisenberg's uncertainty principle.

(If you try to observe a particle's position, you'll end up disturbing its momentum by the act of observing, and vice-versa)

  

Bohm seems to have applied this to the mind. He says that if you think about what you are thinking, you will end up distorting what you're thinking.

But analogy this is inherently flawed. This reasoning doesn't avoid an external observer from observing what you're thinking.

  

A particle's momentum is dependent on the momentum of other particles near it.

Bohm seems to consider it to be similar to how the meaning of a word depends on the context in which it is used.

  

In short, I feel Bohm's analogies to be more of beautiful poetry than science.

  

Regards

Pradyumna
