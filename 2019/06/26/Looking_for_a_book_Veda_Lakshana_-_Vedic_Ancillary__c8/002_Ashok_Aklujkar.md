Dr. K. Paramesvara Aithal (note “h”) was a member of the Adyar Library staff around 1969. Then he spent many years as a (well-appreciated) lecturer at the University of Heidelberg. I had heard that subsequent to his retirement, he returned to his native place in Karnataka, probably near Udupi. The following volume, published in 2001, consists of papers read at a conference organized at Heidelberg to felicitate him on the occasion of his retirement: *The Pandit. Traditional Sanskrit Scholarship in India. Festschrift Parameshvara Aithal*. (ed) Michaels, Axel. New Delhi: Manohar. South Asian Studies series.

  

I would be (sadly)surprised if the Adyar Library and Research Centre or the GOMLin Chennai does not have a copy of the careful compilation in which you are interested.
