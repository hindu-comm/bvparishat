This wonderful book is available in rich libraries like BORI or Oriental Institute,Baroda,Mumbai Uni., Pune Uni. etc.from where he collected MSD material.

  

Pl. try to contact those authorities,as it may not be available for sale since it was published some 20/30 years back.

  

Best luck in your search.
