In fact, Sir, if you'd consider divulging birth details, may I also have them?  
Your mannerism suggests that exalted Saturn is very likely in the  
birth chart, so I wonder if you're born in the exalted Jupiter and  
exalted Saturn period that happened in 1954/55. Also, it would be  
interesting to see which drshti of Mars you have on the 2nd house,  
e.g. 7th from Tula (with Saturn), or 4th from exaltation in Makara, or  
8th from Kanya.  
Thank you for considering the request, whatever your decision.  
  
Irene
