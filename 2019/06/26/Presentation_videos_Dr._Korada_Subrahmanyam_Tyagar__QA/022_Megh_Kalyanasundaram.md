Wow!

  

While I am very glad I purchased **Theories of Language**, it is most kind of you, Professor, to share a PDF version of what, in my view, is truly a rare, one-of-its-kind, book which opens a line of enquiry that has, to my knowledge, no precedent.

  

Thank you for writing that book and for sharing these PDFs.

  

Sincerely,

Megh
