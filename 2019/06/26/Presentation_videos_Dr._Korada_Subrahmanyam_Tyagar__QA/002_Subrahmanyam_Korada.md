आयुष्मान् भव वीरराघव

  

I love your candid feedback .

  

Let me confess I am a fast speaker and several people , in fact , suggested me to regulate the speed . Even my Telugu is difficult to understand for a new person . I apologize to the audience .

  

I shall try to follow your valuable suggestion . Having inherited a thinner tongue from Mother and with कुजदृष्टि to वाक्स्थानम्

( मेषराशिः - मीनलग्नम् ) often it becomes difficult for me , if not impossible .

  

Yes - we have to maintain a very high standard - in order to be relentless to the opponent - who without proper qualification and training (encouraged by certain म्लेच्छ-s with Awards and Rewards - this is the weakness with many people in the society ) wishes to derogate a great योगिन् - day in and day out - we cannot brook such a behavior --

  

परमतम् अप्रतिषिद्धम् अनुमतं भवति --- **सुश्रुतसंहिता - उत्तरतन्त्रम्**

  

Patanjali hinted about such a behavior --

  

तत्कारी च भवान् तद्द्वेषी च ( **महाभाष्यम् , तस्यापत्यम् पा सू etc** )

  

A person earned a lot of name , fame and wealth - living on that - but
after some years insults the composer .

  

Some aspects - such as -- शब्दोत्पत्ति as described in पाणिनीयशिक्षा - पूर्वमीमांसा (शाबरभाष्यम् ) - गान्धर्ववेद ( सङ्गीतरत्नाकरः -

अध्याय 4 ) ----- origin of त्यागराज-s कृति-s in various उपनिषत्-s -- are discussed .

  

I can recite वेद but cannot render a कृति -- just दुरदृष्टम् ।

  

Soon the full article - my first on गान्धर्ववेद - running into 7,500 words - will be before the scholars and I expect गुणदोषविचार

of the same . I had had very short time to prepare the Article .

  

आपरितोषाद्विदुषां न साधु मन्ये.....

  

धन्यो’स्मि
