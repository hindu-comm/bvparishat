That was amazing demonstration of predictive astrological skill from Sri Irene, knowing the planetary positions in a horoscope of a person from the video of that person.

  

But may I request to keep some of this discussion in individual mails unless there is something like that demonstration of interesting predictive ability of the field of horoscopic astrology or something like that?
