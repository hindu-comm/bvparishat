Thank you, Sir.

It all makes sense now: vaksthana is supercharged with Saturn and Mars, it’s as if the strength of energy flowing in is such that physical organs of speech struggle to output it in real time.

Also the contents of the 8th house reveals a person whose life essence is dharma. All events and acts, major or minor, are seen markedly through the dharmic lens.
