Namaste Koradaji,

  

As you are aware I too am aज्यौतिषिकः.  (You corrected me when in an earlier post I called myself a Jyotishi). From the brief details of your chart that you mention here, yours is an extremely interesting chart. It is a well accepted theory in Jyotisham that two debilitated planets aspecting each other leads to neechabhanga of both of them.

  

In your chart two exalted planets - Guru and Kuja - aspect each other. In such cases there is a doubt that this may lead to their Uchhabhabga. Your nativity is definitely an argument against such a doubt.

  

If you don’t mind, can you please share with me too your natal details at my email - [sven...@gmail.com]().

  

Pranams once again,

Venkat
