Dear Shri Korada Garu

  

Brilliant!

  

From your to the point and scholarly replies that hit every issue out of the stadium, it is hard to believe you are also possessed of a very classy sense of humour.

  

Kindly try to take your time and speak slowly so that listeners can have the time to digest what might seem mundane or shallow by your very high standards. It also makes for a more pleasurable listening experience.

  

You sir are a star.

  

Namaskarams.
