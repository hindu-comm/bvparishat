Respected Prof. Subramanyam garu,

  

Namskaram.

Hearty congratulations on such a beautiful exposition connecting Tyaga brahma's kritis with Panini sutras and sastric references from Puranas. The views expressed by you resonates with that of Brahmasri Yanamandra Srinivasa Sarma garu.

I come from a family of musicians and veda pundits from amalapuram, saakuru, peruru and aaduru. My grandfather and father are both violinists.

Your birth chart is very valuable for my study using KP astrology. Just like you, my vaksthana has Sa + Ma combination.

I am also going through your body of work, right from your thesis. I am also an alumnus of Hyderabad Central University. I hope to meet you when I will come to Hyderabad, with your kind permission.

  

Sincerelyyours

Raghu
