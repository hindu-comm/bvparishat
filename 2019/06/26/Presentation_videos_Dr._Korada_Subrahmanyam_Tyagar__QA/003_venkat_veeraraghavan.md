Dear Shri Korada Garu,

  

Thank you for your blessings which mean a lot to me.

  

Do you mind sending me your birth details? (time, date and place of birth?)

I am a bit of a jyotisha hack ( i like to look at unique horoscopes and see what makes them unique).

My email address is [vvenk...@gmail.com]()

  

It is sometimes good that asuric shakti reaches node lambda because that guarantees that the forces of light also rise to meet the challenge.

Unfortunately since we live in mediocre times, instead of Hiranyakashipu, we have to be content with TM Krishna who lacks in shastra, shAstra and tapObala. A trifecta in the negative sense.

It is sad that Shri Thyagaraja who did not make a single paisa with all his Kritis despite having had the opportunity to do so is being criticised by people who have built their careers on the soil of his bikshA. I don't know what is more shameless or honourless than this. This is almost on the level of Gurudroha which is worse than Guru-hatya. I have seen this lack of shraddha in many modern musicians who see this more as a career than as a calling. I was surprised that such nonsense should come out of TMK of all people because he is not known to be a clock-watcher at 'kutcheris' and sometimes keeps singing 1-2 hours past his time limit if there is audience interest. This just shows that dussangha and lack of shastric grounding can corrupt even decent people.

I just hope that if he even had a straw of bhakti when singing that bhakti saves him from his durbuddhi and grants proper vision.

  

Rest is in Rama's hands...:)

  

I hope to read your full article soon.

  

Kind Regards,

  

Venkat
