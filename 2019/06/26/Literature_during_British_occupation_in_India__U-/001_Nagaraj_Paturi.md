There is a huge amount of such literary expression. But mostly it is in various regional Indian languages.

  

One author who articulated that in a big way in Telugu was Kavisamrat Viswanatha Satyanarayana. He articulated that through a huge number of his literary works including a big number of his novels.

  

Magnum Opus of him among them is his classic novel Veyi Padagalu (Thousand Hoods)

  

Late Indian PM Sri P V Narasimha Rao translated that into Hindi.

  

There is a news item regarding its translation into English:
