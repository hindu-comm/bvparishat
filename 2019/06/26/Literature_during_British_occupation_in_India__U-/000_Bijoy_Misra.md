Friends,

Lately I am studying the recorded history of India's deterioration

during the period of British occupation. What we see in outcome

is a fully ravaged India, exploited and choked. I wanted to check  

if people have any reference of the poetic expressions of the pain.

I would think dramatic arts may exist. I will search myself,

but thought to ask. Thank you in advance.  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
