Teach history in Sanskrit  

  

Which languages a child should learn has become a big dilemma for policy makers in India. Picking up a common language for the entire nation, where states were created based on the languages is a challenge. It has become more difficult when some political parties use this to create conflict for vote-bank tactics To break the dead-lock, a completely different perspective may be useful. Why not we teach history in Sanskrit language, and Sanskrit is not taught as a separate language, but becomes a medium of teaching history ?

  

History being taught in Sanskrit, serves 2 purposes -

1 - teaching इतिहास to people in its true form.

2 - learning Sanskrit language while studying history.

  

How can we do that -

Please see the books by Sanskrit Bharati. Sanskrit is not as a separate subject, but directly used for teaching Bhagvad Gita ( गीताप्रवेशः, भाषाप्रवेशः) In this case, we create history syllabus in Sanskrit, and teach it in the similar way. 

  

Need for change -

We are now in a digital age, where information is available on a tip of our fingers. Memorizing the dates of the wars, names of the conquering rulers and others is not that important. Our history has been distorted, and history seems to be more focused on Mughal and British occupation. A need to re-write history giving appropriate place to our ancient history, from the eras of Vedas is important. So instead of writing this history in English, we write it in the God’s own language, Sanskrit and teach them in school. A child will learn Sanskrit and history both, without having to choose between the mother-tongue, English, Hindi and other combination, in already overburdened syllabus. As adults we realize that what we learnt in schools, are most of the irrelevant in our career or day-to-day life. So, why not make learning history interesting, relevant and combine it with learning the evergreen Sanskrit language? This will always remain vibrant in the mind, useful, creating national pride and integration.

  

Challenges -

This will require a paradigm shift in our education system. It will take a lot of effort, in creating the right content, having enough teachers who can teach Sanskrit and history, getting general acceptance,. But to break a deadlock, sometimes, out-of-the-box solution is required . Trying to balance between what Indian children should learn , so that they become productive citizens of India leading a fulfilling, ethical life, and as an adult, what a person should generally know is a challenge. With children, already burdened with a lot of syllabus, adding another language as a separate language, which they are not using for daily conversation may not be practical. But presenting history in the form of this language, where students interested in ancient culture, history can continue to study that in the true form will be great. Posting this discussion here, as the learned scholars can see if there is a possibility in this area and take it forward.

  

Observations on the current educational system- -

-----------

(These are based on my 20 years of IT experience, and I am not an educationist or a scholar and reflect my opinion, which are not based on research) 

Barring specialized courses, or fields like medicine, what we have learnt in schools and colleges are most of the time not relevant at work. Also, with disruptive technologies, innovations, there is a constant need to reinvent ourselves, keep pace with the world outside. We see children scoring very high marks in their board exams nowadays, but if these marks really getting translated into high productivity at work, I doubt. In my personal experience, I have seen people with right attitude doing better in career and life. At work, I have students with very high academic records, faring poorly, as they wait for directions from the superiors, rather than coming up with solutions.

  

Education is being marketed as a product for children nowadays, with even kinder-garden schools charging lakhs of rupees as fees. Parents'
fear that their children may not get the right jobs in future is used by the education institutions to extract more and more money, and sell education as a product. There is a lot of pressure on parents to provide the right education for their wards, and this pressure is getting transferred to the children. The productivity is measured in how many marks a child got rather than what is the life-knowledge a child has learnt. This love for marks, gets translated to number of zeroes in the pay-check rather than the job-satisfaction.

  

A paradigm shift is required to break this vicious loop. Let us start teaching the right history, and redefine productivity as it was in our ancient culture, where knowledge was more respected than money. Sanskrit literature provides this platform. If we cannot include Sanskrit as a language, include it as a history. But, we have to provide our children a platform that provides true education, equipping them with skills to survive and flourish in the conflict-filled world, giving them values and earning capacity both..

  

Throwing this as a discussion for all to see if we can come up with a solution that helps us build a better future for our children, without compromising their present happiness.
