Dear Nagaraj Ji,

  

  Thank you for providing Prof. Chamu Krishna Shastry's post regarding this issue. Please keep us informed on this list regarding any further developments in the revisions to the NEP, its actual implementation in various states, and the resulting situation of Sanskrit education. I assume it will be different state by state.
Again thanks for providing this very important information. With regards,

  

Madhav M. Deshpande
