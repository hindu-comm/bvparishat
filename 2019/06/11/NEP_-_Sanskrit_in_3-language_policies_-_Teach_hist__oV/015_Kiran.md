Warija Bhagini makes a great point... (Not sure now) long ago central schools had Social Studies in Hindi, to get Hindi in through the back door. The general 3 language system with English, Regional and Hindi pretty much gets fixed due to job-viability, regional politics and viability of Hindi. There is generally too much politics and agenda in trying to fix/change anything in this area.

  

My take is just like SB has done a fantastic job in getting so many Indians of my generation fascinated first and eventually educated in Samskrit.. A National Outreach completely outside the academic system getting the masses to be fascinated by Samskrit and eventually accept it, would work wonders. A ground-up / grass-root scheme similar to swatch-bharat.. very benign, non-intrusive workshops, quizzes, prizes etc would get the adults excited, who in turn would get their kids into it.

  

I have been a regular traveller to Israel since mid 90s. I have seen how immigrant Indian-Jews (and American-jews) were just starting to learn Hebrew then and were dreading/needing it. But today, I see lots of younger jews don't even know English ! In there it was the mandate of the Nation to unify with Language, so they could do it more explicitly. But, here due to politics the Govt. can probably take it as a non-intrusive outreach, but result-oriented item.

  

Thanks and regards,

Kiran
