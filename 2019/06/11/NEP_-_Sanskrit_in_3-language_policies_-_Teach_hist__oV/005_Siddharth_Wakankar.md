Dear Warija,

  

Thanks for your mail.  

  

Your showing a torch is definitely a very necessary step.

  

We are like the Kasturimriga which is in search of the source of the fragrance when it is within itself.

  

Let us hope that the policy makers herd to this suggestion.

  

Moreover, speakers of almost all the Indian languages have some basic knowledge or grounding in Sanskrit which may help them to try this method with a bit of more sincere efforts.

  

I again congratulate you on this eye.opening mail,which should work in course of time to revive our history and culture and we get a true picture of ourselves.

  

Best luck and kind regards.

  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
