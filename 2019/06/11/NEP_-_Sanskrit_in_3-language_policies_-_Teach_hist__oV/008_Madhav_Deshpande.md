Dear Murthy Ji,

  

  I am aware of this 2016 document. I want to know the current situation in 2019, especially after Tamilnadu rejected the three language formula proposed by the Kasturirangan committee, and the central government clarified that it was not going to impose any language against the will of any state. Where does Sanskrit fit in the current circumstances in various states?
