Warijaji's point of view is verynecessary. I would like to know if Sanskrit translations of NCERT textbooks, say for 10th and 12th standard in Science, maths and social studies are available and if so whether Sanskrit Universities have incorporated them in their undergraduate and graduate courses.

Thanks and regards,

Murthy
