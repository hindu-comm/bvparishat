Dear Colleagues,

  

  From what I read in the Indian newspapers from the distance of being in USA, I understand that the Tamilnadu government objected to the 3 language formula that would have required Tamil/Hindi/English in that state and insisted on teaching only Tamil andEnglish. In response, the BJP government evidently said that no language will be imposed on any states. What is the response from other states, and where would Sanskrit fit in the policy as proposed by the central government? During my schooling days in Pune, we were required to study four languages Marathi/Hindi/English/Sanskrit. However, that changed sometime later to the 3 language formula which made Sanskrit an optional language in states like Maharashtra leading pretty much to the decimation of Sanskrit teaching in such states. Please explain to me how the current proposed policy by the central government is different in relation to Sanskrit. With best regards,
