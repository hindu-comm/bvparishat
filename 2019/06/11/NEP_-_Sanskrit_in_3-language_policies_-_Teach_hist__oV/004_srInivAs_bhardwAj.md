Some of you may have seen[this YouTube series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0nP2tI1s2A&list=PL08hAu-sC-B7ND7lNtgyox_1c0ipa-X_A)on the Bhagavad Gita by Shri. Dr. Padmakumar of Samskrita-Bharathi. It is truly amazing to have commentary of Gita being done in easy Sanskrit in this manner. You will learn the Gita and also be re-introduced to Sanskrit that has been forgotten from the dim mists of enforced learning in childhood.

  

I have forwarded this link to many of my contacts who know that I have been digging into Sanskrit & Yoga these last few years and so ask me for recommendations of how to get into this path.

  

IMHO, this is the best way forward - to learn Sanskrit through Sanskrit being used in existing literature like Gita. I hope this can be done for Ramayana & Mahabharatha too someday.

  

Please do try this out and experience for yourself - it is the most delightful experience possible (assuming you have some very rudimentary knowledge of Sanskrit)
