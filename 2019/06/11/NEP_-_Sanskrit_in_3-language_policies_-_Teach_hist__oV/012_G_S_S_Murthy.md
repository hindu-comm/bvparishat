Thanks, Raghav Prasadji. I went to Sanskrit Tutorial web-site. I could not locate NCERT text books. I got paaribhaashikaSabdaavalI=technical terms. Some of the terms seem inappropriate or inaccurate:

Raajatantram=democracy

caraNaasaktiH= slavery

hiraNyagarbhaH=Golden

yavanaH=Muslim people

ankaH=data

koNaH=element

I could not find out anything to indicate that these terms are standardized by NCERT.

Thanks and regards,

Murthy
