Dear Irene,

thank you for your queries. Since you mentioned our work, Vishwa and I composed a response. It is a bit long for a list, so we uploaded it to Academia.edu (we didn’t mention your name to preserve your privacy, but if you wish us to add it, we will gladly do so). I hope this document helps you understand our views. Please feel free ask any questions.

The file is here:<https://www.academia.edu/39571145/Prolegomena>

Regards,

Joydeep
