Dear members,  
  
I am looking for works on the following topics:  
  
1. How did the sequence of the multiple sub-stories of the Mahabharata  
form? Has the phenomenon of intertwining stories been analysed  
linguistically?  
  
2. What ways exist of determining older and newer additions as the epic evolved?  
  
3. What is known about how reciters memorised epics?  
  
Thank you in advance for considering this query.  
  
Irene
