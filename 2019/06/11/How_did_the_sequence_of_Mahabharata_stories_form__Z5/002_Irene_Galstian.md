Thank you, Dr Paturi.  
I'd already been reading the 2nd item when I decided to post a  
question to the list. Unfortunately, there exists a (largely German)  
overenthusiasm of looking for some mysterious core in texts and then  
trying to explain away the rest. For example, Hebrew Bible studies are  
full of such efforts. I'm not sure where is the enjoyment in this,  
maybe I'm just missing the point.  
All I'm after is music-like listening to the various themes, words and  
phrasing in which these themes are presented, and observing the  
techniques by which these get intertwined into what we know as the  
Mahabharata. And sure, I'd be curious to see how changes in Sanskrit  
usage show up in the text - not to dig up and parade any textual  
layers, but to add a dimension to the enjoyment.  
Just thought I'd clarify this.
