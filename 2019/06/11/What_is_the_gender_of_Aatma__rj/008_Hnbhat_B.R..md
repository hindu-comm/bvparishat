There is no rule in grammar that the different words for the same thing should be used in the same gender. When we refer to the wife we know beongs to femine gender sexually. But we can use कलत्रम् in neuter gender, भार्या in feminine gender and दाराः in masculine gener and in plural only asinदारान् पद्मभुवस्त्रिलोकजननीं वन्दे गिरां देवताम् referring to Saeaswati goddess of speech देवता who is wife of ब्रह्मा. Another example गृहम् is used for the house which we all know any sexual gender and it is used in neuter gender. But it is used in masculine gender and plural only to denote a house and also to denote a wife like the word दारा. The word गेह is used in masculine gender.
