thanks a lot Dhaval ji,

I concluded on my own that Aatma is a neuter word since brahman is a neuter word& both aatma and brahman is same.

Hence the confusion..

  

Thanks a lot V.Subrahmanyam ji for promptly quoting the passages showing it in all 3 genders

  

Thanks a lot Prof.Dr.H.N.Bhat ji asking not to confuse grammar & vedanta parts.

  

namaskarams
