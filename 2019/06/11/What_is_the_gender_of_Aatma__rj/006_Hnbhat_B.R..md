Wrong conclusion on both parts. Both the words have differet genders for the words. While the word aatman is always used in m????.?asculine gender and the word is used in masculine gender to denote the creatot god and only used in neuter gender when it denotes the Supreme Soul. This is due to grammatical gender.

  

Philosophically also when aatmaa has no gender of its own, how it can the same become neuter gender as brahman? Any valid reason you can for it for being brahman than grammatical? First of all conclude which gender you are seeking? Then discuss with others on the matter. There are scholars both in grammar and Vedanta who can give you a better answer.
