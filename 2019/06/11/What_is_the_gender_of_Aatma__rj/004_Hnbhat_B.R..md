The grammatical gender of words in the Sanskrit confused.and sex based gender are two different things. When both are get are got confused. Grammar deals with the gender of words and this can be learnt by
लिङ्गानुशासनम् or नामलिङ्गानुशासन and other lexicons. Upanishads do not deal with the gender of Sanskrit words or govern their usage. So there is not the question of the word aatman being the topic discussion. The purpurt of the upanishad sentence is that aatman the soul does not change according to the sex of the body.

  

I think now it is clear that to keep the sequence of gender it is said अयमात्मा and ब्रह्म in neuter gender when it denotes Supreme Soul in Vedanta. The confusion due to the subject matter dealt with grammar and Vedanta.
