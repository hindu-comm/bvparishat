Dear Vidvans,

  

It may be पुरुषः when it comes at the start or in the middle of a stanza. It will be recited as पूर्षः if it comes at the end of the stanza.

  

When it comes at the end the उकार of रु is added to पु thus lenghtening it and hence पूर्षः.

  

If the word is recited as पूरुषः the word will get split as पू and रुषः.

  

This from a phonetic perspective.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve
