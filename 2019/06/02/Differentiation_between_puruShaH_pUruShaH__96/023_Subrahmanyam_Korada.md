नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

Anyhow I think there is no difference of meaning or shade of meaning as requested by Dr. Yadu except difference in etymology.

                 ----- विद् हरिनारायणभट्टः

  

You are perfectly right - answer to the original question is - there is no difference in terms of meaning or shade of meaning between पुरुषः and पूरुषः । Thanks for the alert .

  

Same is the case with नरकः - नारकः , ममहान - मामहान etc. They are in plenty .

  

I just wanted to put a full stop to all such questions -- regarding दीर्घ in both वेद and लोक with regard to many such शब्द्-s -

सुबन्त-s and तिङन्त-s .

  

In an earlier सूत्रम् , ’ जक्षित्यादयष्षट् ’ (पा 6-1-6) Patanjali declares --

  

षसिवशी छान्दसौ ।

दृष्टानुविधयः छन्दसि भवन्ति ( in वेद , the विधि-s follow the usages that are there )
