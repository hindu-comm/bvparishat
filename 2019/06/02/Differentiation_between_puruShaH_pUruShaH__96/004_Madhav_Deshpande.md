Just to note that the variant pūruṣaḥ also occurs in texts like the Bhagavadgītā \[cf.असक्तो ह्याचरन्कर्म परमाप्नोतिपूरुष:andअथ केन प्रयुक्तोऽयं पापं चरतिपूरुष: \|\]. I have not seen any commentators making a distinction of meaning between puruṣa/pūruṣa. At least in the Bhagavadgītā verses, the cause of lengthening could be metrical.
