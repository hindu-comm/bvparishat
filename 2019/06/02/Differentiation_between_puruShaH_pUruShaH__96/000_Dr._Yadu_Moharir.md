Nakaskar Scholars,

  

I am trying to figure out what u=is the difference between पुरुषः AND पूरुषः ?

  

In पुरुषः सूक्त पुरुषः (पु is ऱ्हस्व) in #1, #11, #15; however, it is पूरुषः (पू is दीर्घ) in #3 and # 5.

  

Can someone elaborate and explain the different shade of meaning of this term.

  

Thank you in advance

  

Rgds

  

Dr Yadu
