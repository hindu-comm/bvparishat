Dear Vidwans,

  

Is it not necessary to look into the derivation of the word पुरुषः in order to determine what form it should take if the chanda demands one more matra for completion. What if the added matra is at the wrong place? Is it not necessary to look into the nature of shift in the अभ्यंतर प्रयत्न on account of lengthening of the vowel of the first consonant on the following letters. Shastras need to be used constructively or inductively and not as justification to ratify word forms.

  

Word forms do not acquire permanance by writing. The written form has to be enlivened through the vaikhari. The discussion therefore needs to be focussed on how to phonate the word.

  

In order to achieve definite ends definite means need to be used (Here is the importance of viniyoga). Therefore the question is how do we phonate the word पुरुषः in case we need to lengthen it by 1 matra on account of the demands of the chanda so that neither is the chanda nor the meaning to be conveyed affected. Does the matter get solved merely by placing a deergha उ kara to प ?



With regards,

Achyut Karve
