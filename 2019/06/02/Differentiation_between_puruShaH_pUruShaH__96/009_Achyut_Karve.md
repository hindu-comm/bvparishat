Dear Vidwans,

  

If one wants to still join the two i.e. पू - रुषः it can be done by undoing the guna of रु and the pada then becomes पूऋषः. The form of the word then depends on what meaning one intends to convey.

  

Further still the question of the counting of the matras as well as the intonation of the pada separately and when it comes in a verse needs to be explained. I think those well versed in the Ashtadhyayi need to answer.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve
