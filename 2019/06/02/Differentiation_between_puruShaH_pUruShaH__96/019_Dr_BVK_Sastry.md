Namaste



Purely a question from statistical data perspective to highlight the criticality of question raised by Dr.Yadu and importance of technicality provided by Prof. Korada after due and long deliberation. This is also deeply connected with the other question raised by Achyut Karve on ' word -split' and ' 18 An- classifications'.



**Question:** Can we list out where all, in the entire gamut of known vedic texts and usages the terms \<पुरुषः & पूरुषः \> occur ?

How many times? With What variations? Is there a context sensitive meaning in other shastras?



**Why this question needs detailed analysis and clarity on the deergha in the term \< पुरुषः & पूरुषः \>** : WHY Paninian Tradition has made so much technically elaborate fine tuned discussion on ' deergha'
in a specific ' vedic term' ? We know Paninian tradition is extremely fuzzy and technical in ' form justification including the accent', as seen in the last sutra of ashtaadhyaayi making the 'a' sound shift from vivrutha to samvrutha ??



 If there was no purpose, no meaning change , no application-utility (viniyoga) as Dr. Yadu would say, why grammarians went so fuzzy to justify the ' deergha form' ?

What would the Meemaamasakas (The Yajnika Vaakya-Shaastra)
and Tarka -people (pramana-Shaastra) say on this ' Vyakarana deliberation as (pada-Shaastra-paddhati) ?

What are we missing in learning 'Veda' without Vedanga Vyakarana?

What are we missing in teaching 'Vedanta' with inappropriate understanding of Veda' ? Why Gita used ' Poorushah ? and also ' Purusha' in the same text ??

What is the essence of Gita statement : Vedantakrit, Vedavideva chaaham ( Gita 15-15: sarvasya chāhaṁ hṛidi sanniviṣhṭo ,mattaḥ smṛitir jñānam apohanaṁ cha

vedaiśh cha sarvair aham eva vedyo, **vedānta-kṛid veda-vid eva chāham.** ) ?



It is easy to dismiss the question by saying -' it was a fancy slack pronunciation'. But the Paninian tradition has not looked at Veda as a social slack slang usage !



If we, the people of tradition stick to one easy go path in explaining one Vedic Samskruth technical term, we would end up in a larger mess by ignoring the context of 'interpreting Purusha sukta in a Veda specific way and where all it appears, it is used '. It is like fighting for the tail and rope, when the Cow is gone ! The effort needs to be made in understanding the tradition ( poorvaacharya sampradaya ) before passing a remark .



I have no shame in accepting my limitation in the current position- ' I don't have a ready and satisfying answer to Dr. Yadu's question' from what i have studied so far. I will continue to look for more information'.

Anyhow I think there is no difference of meaning or shade of meaning as requested by Dr. Yadu except difference in etymology.
