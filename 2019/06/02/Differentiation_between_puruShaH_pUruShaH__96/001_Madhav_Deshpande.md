Dear Yadu Ji,

  

  These two variant readings have existed side by side from early Vedic and have lead to different etymologies in the Upaniṣads. One etymology is from *pūrva*+ root *uṣ* seen in the Brihadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad \[*pūrvam auṣat*\]. This seems to be based on the reading *pūruṣa* \[*pūr \< pūrva*, *uṣa*\< root *uṣ*\]. The other Upaniṣadic etymology is from *puri+śete*. This seems to be based on the reading *puruṣa*, but Professor M.A. Mehendale from Pune in one of his research papers has suggested that this etymology actually seems to suggest a reading puriśa. The words purisa \[Pali\] and puliśa \[Magadhi\] are attested in various texts and inscriptions. With best regards,
