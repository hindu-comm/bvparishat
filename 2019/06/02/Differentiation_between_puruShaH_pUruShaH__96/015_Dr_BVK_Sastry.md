Namaste



This thread has opened up very interesting issues that have a bearing on :- **How Vaiyakaranas (Panini Sampradaya) and Nairuktas (Yaska) understood each other's discipline as one integral part of ' VEDNAGA'- Sampradaya?** **And How are we dealing with this ' Tradition'?**



We may not agree with what all the text and tradition says; but we need to bring out truly what the author of the text has desired to say and said. 



In current period, there seems to be very limited number of persons and training institutions / schools who stand by the integrated perspective of ' Saanga-Shadanga Vedanga Adhyayana -Sampradaya' to understand and practice Vedas. Literal translators of vedic texts are nowhere close to be spokes persons of 'Vedas'. This problem is as old as Yaska - Patanjali sampradaya itself. 



***First:*** The discussion on what ' Purusha' means according to Nairuktas : ( Image at page:
<https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.553723/page/n361> ; print page 309 and 310) detailing ' Purusha' in a different way. It is different from what the current posts are pointing to.



When Yaska allows 'avyam' to be interpreted as ' avyayam', (<https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.553723/page/n77> - Print page LXIV ) he has his reasons well documented in the text itself.
**Treating the text of Yaska as a ' Carelessness, Corruption, Alteration' is Editors opinion**.



And how this is not reflected in Vaiyakarana and Amarakosha resources. 

(Nirukta and amarakosha:
<https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.553723/page/n71> )



If one were to read only the 'Translation without understanding the tradition in original and full', the outcome comment is will not stand as a valid conclusion!

Any further say and research built on such partial translations and views will be 'Defective - Damaging -Damning the Tradition'. 



**Yaska's caution is 'Single words sans context must not be deliberated for meaning deliberations ( 31-16/17 ) !** Words have different
senses and connotations in different contexts.
(<https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.553723/page/n47> - Print Page XXIX) . Yaska also quotes at (25/5-8) Gargya's opinion in relation to the technicality of the term 'praadeshika' - These are number of words which are not root-born; and there by censures those who would derive every word from a root. Illustrative examples are given there itself. ( [https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.553723/page/n46](https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.553723/page/n46)
- Print page XXIX )



The discussion at this page on 361, Yaska’s Nirukta,vol.1 edited by
by Rajavade,v.k. Ed. should make it clear that there are a plurality of views within the tradition in explaining this term under discussion.
The explanation varies by the discipline.



***Second***: The traditional schools have always held that all Vednaga disciplines are concurrent in their goal , internally and integrally connected. Yaska follows the dictum
(<https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.553723/page/n365> - Print Page 314 - to 317) Nirukta must not be taught to one ignorant of Vyakarana. 



Yet, Later Colonial and Oriental scholars speak of:

- Yaska's Carelessness' (
[https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.553723/page/n67
](https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.553723/page/n67)- Print Page LIV )

- Yaskas Prejudice (<https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.553723/page/n51> - Print Page XXXIV)



**Concluding with a note of wondering on the question**: Have we understood the 'Saanga - Shadanga-Vedanga Model' relation between Nirukta and Vyakarana , beyond the 'Colonial Thought infected interpretations and translations in the Published Text?? 



Source text is fine. But the Translations and over arching comments are questionable'.



This seems to be the essence of the referred text published in 1940 under auspices of BORI ?? ( <https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.553723/page/n84> - Print Page LXX)
