Dear Sri Achyut-ji,

  

\> I think those well versed in the Ashtadhyayi need to answer.

  

Those who have responded are well versed not only in Ashtaadhyaayee but even in other S'aastras that are required to be used in such interpretations.

  

You need not trouble yourself and your readers by trying to enter into the domain where I am sure your expression itself shows that you are not that "well versed" case.

  

I does not hurt to learn from such well versed.

  

Reasonable paripras'naa posed to such scholars shall make you be the representative of many other members of the list with such reasonable or good queries.
