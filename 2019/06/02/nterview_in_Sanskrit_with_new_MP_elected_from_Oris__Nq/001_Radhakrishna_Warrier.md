Nice interview. So, the surname of this MP from Odisha is ṣaḍaṅgi (with six aṅga-s), not Sāraṅgi as they transcribe in many regional language newspapers. I think in Oriya they write ṣaḓaṅgī (ḍ with a dot underneath it - ड़ ଡ଼). This ḍ with a dot underneath is transcribed in English using “r” in much of north India (लड़की - larki). In spoken Odia, I believe there is no distinction between ष and स (ଷ and ସ) so both these are transcribed in English using “s”. I think that is how ଷଡ଼ଙ୍ଗୀ (षड़ङ्गी) becomes Sarangi in English transcription.

  

Regards,

Radhakrishna Warrier
