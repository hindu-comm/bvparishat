Would anyone like to comment on the distinction between these two words in terms of practical usage? Thank you.  
  
Monier-Williams gives the following meanings for the two words which nevertheless does show where the semantic fields cross. Surprisingly "tradition" is the only translation that is common to both.  

-   *param-parā:*\[lit. "one to another."\](1) an uninterrupted row
    or series, (2) order, (3) succession, (4) continuation, (5)
    mediation, (6)*tradition*. -   *sampradāya*: (1)*tradition*, (2) established doctrine transmitted
    from one teacher to another, (3) traditional belief or usage, (4)
    any peculiar or sectarian system of religious teaching, (5) sect.
