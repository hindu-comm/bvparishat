Dear Scholars,

  

Some interesting information regarding the sources for *māteva hitakāriṇī(ṃ)* was provided by Elliot Stern, and I quote his words:

  

"I found these two similar half verses:

  

harītakī manuṣyāṇāṃ māteva hitakāriṇī \|

  

This appears as verse 26cd in the shorter harītakīkalpa of the āśvinasaṃhitā published in the Appendix to Part II of Rudolf Hoernle, The Bower Manuscript.

  

Sadā hitā manuṣasya māteva hitakāriṇī \|

  

This appears as verse 22ab of the longer version published in the same appendix.

  

You can find these in the last few pages of<https://archive.org/details/HoernleBowerManuscriptIntroductionincomplete/page/n14>"

  

The Bower Manuscript is dated to 4th - 6th century A.D. and we know at least that the reading *māteva hitakāriṇī* in relation to Harītakī goes back to that date. When the variant *harītakīṃ bhuṅkṣva rājan māteva hitakāriṇīm* developed is as yet unknown, but the earliest discussions of this line are in the works of Nāgeśabhaṭṭa and Bālamanoramā, to my knowledge. Since this is the only cited example (so far in our discussion) with the nominative of upamāna and accusative of the upameya, it would be useful if the source of this quotation and its approximate date can be determined. With best regards,
