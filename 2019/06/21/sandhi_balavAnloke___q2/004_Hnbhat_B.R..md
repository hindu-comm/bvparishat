In earlier prints where the anunasika l in conjunct may not be possible it was written after the preceeding vowel as in

विद्वाँल्लिखति । नकारस्याऽनुनासिको लकारःl but the anunasika is for the for the first l replacing n as per तोर्लि and not for the preceding vowel. Now it is can be exactly typed above l as you have written in the second option. I can type only विद्वाँल्लिखति or बलवाँल्लोके only and not as you have been able to type anunasika symbol exactly above halved ल्।

  

This explains the other convention putting anusvara symbol above preceding आ। But correct is the second as you have typed. In earlier prints I have seen the first only probabably it was not possible type set as required.
