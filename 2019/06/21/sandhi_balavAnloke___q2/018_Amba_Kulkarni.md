Dear Ramakrishnan,

  

Thank you very much for these two recordings.

Excellent. As you said, 2, 4 and 6 are really very good.

I also liked these fonts. May I know where is the Wikner's pre-processor available ?

I searched on the internet but could not find one.

  

Another question, will there be any difference in the pronunciation of the 1st and the 2nd ?

  

With kind regards,

Amba
