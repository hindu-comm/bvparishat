Prof. Kulkarni,

  

The pronunciation will not differ. I think the issue is how to map the sounds to a visual medium. Of course there can never be a satisfactory mapping of all phonological subtleties to a visual medium. But I believe that the best and actually complete effort in the Taittiriya side is by the old Kumbhakonam paNDita-s with their remarkable publications.

  

Please see <https://ctan.org/pkg/sanskrit> for documentation. The issue of course is you can’t use it with polyglossia and so on. But the advantage is that you can make modifications to Wikner’s C code to suit your purpose. I have done that for some things. It’s cumbersome to use, yet a very good package for Vedic Sanskrit even now.

  

I had corresponded quite a bit with Shri Wikner a long time back, he used to be a member of the Advaita mailing list. He went off the internet to concentrate on his sAdhana a long time back. He has put quite a bit of thought on samyutAkSharas, what the distance between ligatures should be etc. A truly remarkable piece of work.

  

Ramakrishnan
