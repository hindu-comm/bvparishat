My doubt -

  

बलवान् + लोके = बलवाँल्लोके

==> The original order on left side is न्‌ ल्‌ ल् ओ

On right side it is also the same, with duplications of sounds.

  

  

  

बलवान् + लोके = बलवाल्ँलोके ?

==> Here on right side, the order is ल्‌ न्‌ ल् ओ changed from left side.

  

So shouldn't the first be the correct way of writing?

  

  
Thanks,  
Shashi
