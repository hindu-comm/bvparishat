Namaste

  

This thread has many complex issues and technicalities to address. At the end of this post, I have made an effort to trace the criss cross nature of debate on this point shifting from digital typesetting convention, print convention, hand scripting, pronunication, rule base, and issues of varna-duplication and nasalization.

  

What seems to be print convention for scripting बलवान् + लोके appears to be \< बलवा- ल्ँलो-के \>. This convention seems to be in conformity with 1910 text of Siddhanta kaumudi with Balamanorama commentary ( in pre-computer era, under manual typesetting.
<https://archive.org/details/BalamanoramaUttara1/page/n85-> print page 78) shows la with anunasika marking. (as shown for vidvanlikhati)

The other points that one may note in this context are the following:

a\) la- has anunasika and ananunasika forms ( just as ya- va). They are represented with different script symbol to point to pronunciation. The translator says : the simple letter ' ya-va-la- include the nasalized also. This could be the reason to over look the anunasika specificity. (<https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.283755> - page - Sirishchandra Vasu - rule 1-1-66 (SK 14).

b\) anusvara- has anunasika form (Rule 1-1-9 (SK10) . It does not come under the count of Varnas. Rule 1-1-9 (SK9) gives anunasika lakshana. This is for pronunciation and not for script. Rule 1-1-10 (SK 13) sets the conditions by which (saavarnya) similarity between svaras and vyanjanas. In the term 'deerghaadeenam-iva' in commentary, the svara related and anunaasika related issues are covered.1-1-66 (SK 14) clearly says ' ya-va-la' are having two classifications : anunasika and ananunaasika.

c\) The 'la'- varieties discussion is available in detail under the example 'tavalkarah' - 8-4-65 (SK 71). The inheritance of 'svara related feature of anunasika and ananunasika , is at 1-1-77 (SK 47), which sets the sandhi rule where 'svara lru changes to 'l'.  
 Starting SK47 dealing with svara-sandhi to 8-4-64 (SK 60) the technicalities of 'lru- la' related come in.

d\) Under 8-4-65(SK71) the example of 'tavalkaarah' would be interesting to study. Under rule 8-3-32 (SK134), 8-3-5 (SK135), 8-3-2 (SK 136) put together provide the context in which the nasal vowel may be optionally substituted for the preceding vowel after fulfilling a condition. The 'na' related substitution from SK134 flows in to this rule SK136, with the example 'sannachyutah'.  
I have not been able to get the 'sutra' clarity on the anunasika and ananunasika point here. The problem link is 8-4-60 (SK 117) - (rule - 'torli') where 'ta' is changed to pure ' la', while the dento-nasal 'n' is changed to nasal l' .

d\) The 'na' related substitution and anunasika/ananunasika comes under the illustration 'sannachyutah' - by putting together rules 8-3-32 (SK134), 8-3-5 (SK135), 8-3-2 (SK 136).

  
***Tracing the problem - responses*** :

It started with the question on 'correctness of scripted form : बलवान् + लोके = बलवाँल्लोके or बलवान् + लोके = बलवाल्ँलोके ?. The justification for 'two la-karas' is given by rule \<तोर्लि। \> without touching on the 'nasalization part. The shift in the anusvara mark on 'va' and 'la' in the post seems to have been overlooked.

Then the 'type setting issue - digital script display of devanagari characters and symbols ( using a software under the constraints of a machine, Operating system, Fonts, and application) issue was highlighted \<In earlier prints where the anunasika l in conjunct may not be possible it was written after the preceeding vowel as in विद्वाँल्लिखति । नकारस्याऽनुनासिको लकारःl but the anunasika is for the for the first l replacing n as per तोर्लि and not for the preceding vowel. Now it is can be exactly typed above l as you have written in the second option. I can type only विद्वाँल्लिखति or बलवाँल्लोके only and not as you have been able to type anunasika symbol exactly above halved ल्। This explains the other convention putting anusvara symbol above preceding आ। But correct is the second as you have typed. In earlier prints I have seen the first only probabably it was not possible type set as required \>

The next response introduced the \< No, there is no extra lakAra there. ..... .duplications of sounds...The pronunciations of nasalised आ and आन् are not same; why, even the mAtrAs are different! Further, the duplicated lakAra would be unnecessary if everything else is to remain the same, since unlike other duplications, this would be more tedious to pronounce. .... here on right side, the order is ल्‌ न्‌ ल् ओ changed from left side. So shouldn't the first be the correct way of writing? ....  
Fortunately, logic is no good to counter the sUtrapramANa, as you see above, I can provide another logical argument. The substitute for tavarga letter, in this case nakAra, is savarNa of the lakAra following, which happens to be a nasalised lakAra. If you go with the former, then you're nasalising the AkAra \> . This was followed by a \< hunch argument> - \< If we let Panini Rules lie, my hunch would be for the following : न् +ल् -> अनुस्वार +ल्-> अनुस्वार+ल्+ल् \> The debate shifts to \< Is a anuswara a nasika or an anunasika in the devanagari alphabet or script needs to be first dwelt on. Are nasikas considered as letters by Panini? ..... Are अं आँ anunasikas or nasikas? If they are indeed anunasikas of which class are they?> for which the response line switches to \< appropriate sequence of varnas and nasal pronunciation issue - ततः न्-कारात् परस्य ल्-कारस्योच्चारः अनुनासिकः नैव \| and \< नकरोऽनासिक एवानुनासिकचिह्नं विनापि। आकारस्यानुनासिकापेक्षा नास्त्येवात्र। तोर्लि इति अनुनासिकस्य नकारस्य
स्थाने लकार आदेशः स्थानेऽन्तरतमः इति सूत्रेण तादृश एवाननुनासिको लकारो भवति, न तु निरनुनासिकलकारः। नकारस्य सानुनसिकनिरनुनासिकभेदो नास्ति, लकारस्य तु द्वैविध्यमस्तीति अनुनासिकचिह्नमपि तस्यैवापेक्षितम्। नाकारस्य न वा नकारस्यानुस्वारस्यापेक्षा, अत्र नकारस्य पदान्तत्वात् अपदान्तत्वाभावान्नात्रानुस्वारः संभवति। \>
