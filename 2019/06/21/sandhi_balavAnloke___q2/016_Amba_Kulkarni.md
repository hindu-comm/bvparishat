I would be interested in listening to the actual pronunciation of this. If you have any clip, please send it to me.

Yes. Precisely this is the problem, we can not get half l glyph, the moment we have an anunaasika after it. ल ्+ any consonant produces half l glyph as in ल ् ल = ल्ल. But ल ् ँ does not produce half l glyph. This is the problem of rendering engine.

And I think this can be corrected with the computer technology. As I understand, this case arises with all anthasthas (semi-vowels) viz. y, v, r and l. And there will be challenges when such a samyuktaakshara has vowels that are rendered partially or completely on the top part such as े  ै ो ौ ि   ी  etc. You need to decide the placing of
ँ in such cases. And therefore, though it does not look compact, I think ल्ँल is the better option.

  

With regards,  

Amba
