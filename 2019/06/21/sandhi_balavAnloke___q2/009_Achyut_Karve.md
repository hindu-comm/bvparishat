Dear Vidwans,

  

Is a anuswara a nasika or an anunasika in the devanagari alphabet or script needs to be first dwelt on. Are nasikas considered as letters by Panini?

  

Is it not a tragedy that Sanskrit Professionals are just satisfied with how a word should be written rather than how it is phonated. Can any one upload an audio clip to show the difference between the phonation of the two alternative representations under consideration?  

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
