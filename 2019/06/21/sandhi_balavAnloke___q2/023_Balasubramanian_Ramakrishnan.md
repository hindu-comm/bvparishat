Sorryfor the late reply - combination of travel and some ill health. Prof. Deshpande, just to make sure that I understood your comment below, in the example trīl̃lokān, are you saying that the nasalization of the first lakAra spills over into the second, supposedly non-nasalized lakAra as well, as per modern articulatory linguistics?

  

Thank you.

  

Ramakrishnan
