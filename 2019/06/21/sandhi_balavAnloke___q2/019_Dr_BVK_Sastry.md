Namaste



1. I notice that the discussion is now moving more towards the digital
typography . I submit a frame in which this discussion could be meaningfully steered.



1a. Wikner -Pre processor itself is built on a Romadev map which is looking at a \<devanagari Script -mapping> using \< Roman alphabet character set -lens>. 

The link says:
[https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/40879/transliteration-in-devanagari/40885#40885](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/40879/transliteration-in-devanagari/40885%2340885)
\< As far as I know, the "devanagari" package does not have support
for Roman Transliteration. You should try the **outdated**, **yet capable sanskrit package** by Charles Wikner which has full support for Devanagari and Roman

Transliteration.



1b. Here is a 551 page document - Reverse Sanskrit Dictionary providing glyphs combinations. <http://www.sanskritweb.net/sansdocs/reverse1.pdf> - 



 1c**: Here below I place a pointer reference in a web discussion in the time span (2002 to 2018) on Digital Devanagari Typography** .

The anchor is the most widely used portable file format (PDF) provided by Adobe. url: [http://www.typophile.com/node/95460?page=1](http://www.typophile.com/node/95460?page=1%20) ( two pages).

 The resources referred to build Adobe Digital Typography resource are prior period print works for Conjunct Tables (Samyukta Aksharas) :

 (i) Coulson, Michael. Teach yourself Sanskrit.

 (ii) Monier-Williams. A practical grammar of the Sanskrit Language.

(iii) Vasu, S.C. Aṣṭādhyāyī of Pāṇini.

(iv) Agenbroad, J.E. 'Difficult characters: a collection of Devanagari conjunct consonants' (in Bulletin 38 of the International Association of Orientalist

Librarians).



 Some of these technical resources are available at : <http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/language/sanskrit> as file [sktdoc.ps](http://sktdoc.ps) ;

[www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MWScan/tamil/index.html](http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MWScan/tamil/index.html) ;; <http://typophile.com/node/95460>.



 **This may be useful to review where Indian Linguistic diversity and demography has been continuously influenced and is being pushed by the dynamics in digital **

**typography , where \< Anglicized approach is business fundamental> to represent - print-distribute- outreach Indian languages to Indian society consumers. **

The immediate impact is in news print journal, visual subtitle magazine media format.

Long term impact is in Education of Indian languages
built on foundation of Romanized representation and analytics of Indian native languages;

Specific and limited to Samskrutham in the context of discussions in this thread.





 The interesting observations extracted are the following:



(i) **More than 300 of the approx. 1000 conjunct consonants, i.e. roughly 30% of the collection by Agenbroad, are entirely fictitious, as
far as Sanskrit is concerned**. Some of these 300 ligatures compiled by Mr. Agenbroad may occur in foreign-language loan words in Hindi and Marathi texts, but they definitely do not occur in ancient Sanskrit texts.



(ii) Uli Stiehl wrote this: On the invented ligature "bn": "Charles Wilkins (1808), Alix Desgranges (1845), M.R. Kale (1894), Richard Fick (1922), A.A. MacDonell (1926), H.M. Lambert (1953), Michael Coulson (1973) and Madhav M. Deshpande (1997) **invented the conjunct consonant "bn**". If "bn" were no invention, then a Sanskrit word would exist containing "bn". But there does not exist any such Sanskrit word. Therefore "bn" has been invented. Yet "bn" could occur in a foreign-language word, e.g. in "abnormal", inserted into Neo-Sanskrit texts. But serious scientific research on Sanskrit conjunct consonants must dismiss such "abnormalities"."



(iii) Michel Boyer compiled a list of Sanskrit 1379 ligatures based on 15 Sanskrit grammars after reading <http://typophile.com/node/95460>. Graphical variants which are introduced by the authors quoted are treated as separate ligatures, up to 79. As many as 991 are unique to only 1 source (a minimum). 8 are met in 14 out of 15 sources (a maximum). The list is even bigger than Mr. Boyer's Samyoga Table. **But it's not about size. Because errors and ligatures go together a long way.**



 **This shows how much conscious and involved interference has taken place in \< anglicizing - LIPI of Devanagari Samskrutham \>
influencing the social outreach as LIKHITA / / SHAALAA SHIKSHITA /
MUDRITA -SAMSKRUTHAM ' (= Visual scripted display of Devanagari Characters, used across many languages of India, undergoing a core Romanization ).** The active contributors are typographers, Programmers and Oriental researchers. The passive receiving -lamenting -commenting team is scholars of tradition and the public. 



 The root errors are deep seated and deep-guarded by special interests;

 What is seen is branched out deviations, which are far and wide spread to make it difficult to see where the original root-sin is !

( The model of banyan tree with thousand roots springing out of one mother root).



 **What may we all do in this scenario to \< De-Anglicize Sanskrit> to RECOVER \<SAMSKRUTHAM> and walk towards the pole star statement \< Samskruth is best suited language for Computers \>? ! . **
