Prof. Kulkarni,

  

Please find attached two mp3 files extracted from the Vediclinks recordings of the taittirIya (Wikner's notation).

  

Example 1: amuullo#kaanabhiva!r.sa_nti - taittirIya AraNyakam 1.10

Example 2: imallo#kaankaamaannii kaamaruupya!nusa\_\~ncarann - taittirIya AraNyakam 9.

  

You can find some examples of typesetting using Wikner's pre-processor that I have made below. I would go with examples 2, 4 and 6 below and they are pretty good mappings from the phonological to the visual world. However if you check the grantha script snapshot below, you will find that the anunAsika is above even the "i' mark in the sentence. BTW, the sentence reads havi_rdhaana!vvi#\_dyu (from AraNyakam) if you can't read grantham, but it is easy to see the anunAsika and where it is placed. Such a placement makes the most phonological to visual mapping sense, but I am afraid none of the Sanskrit fonts match this level of precision.
