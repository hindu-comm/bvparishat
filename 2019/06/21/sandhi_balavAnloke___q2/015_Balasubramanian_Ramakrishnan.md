Prof. Kulkarni,

  

Using the general principle that a samyutAkShara printing should go from left-to-right or top-to-bottom, the second one is correct. I would also add that the spacing between the la-kAra-s need to be reduced to show it as one unit even in the second one blow. The actual pronunciation has "more" nasal component in the beginning and more "la-kAra" component towards the end, as can be checked form any genuine Vedic recitation. So the second one aptly illustrates that feature as well. You can find the same type of illustration in the older Vedic publications, especially the kumbhakonam Vaidikavardhini press. The former is possibly because at least in the Wikner pre-processor, it spits out an error if an anusvAra is placed after a non-vowel, so you need to place the anusvAra before the lakAra, and hence the issue you point out below.
