The writing practices for examples like trīl̃lokān differ among various manuscript traditions and printing presses. The grammars and the phonetic texts simply say that the first of the two "l" sounds becomes anunāsika, and writing practices try to reproduce this description. As a matter of phonetic fact, the pronunciation of geminate consonants simply involves lengthening the duration of the contact between the articulator and the point of articulation before releasing the contact and we do not have two entirely distinct "l" sounds sitting next toeach other. This is how the pronunciation of geminates is explained in modern articulatory linguistics. In sucha case, it is difficult to imagine that the nasal co-articulation affects only the first "l" and not the second "l" as well, if there is no articulatory boundary between the two "l"s. In the past, I have discussed this situation with phoneticians at Michigan and they are not sure how one would draw such an articulatory boundary. I am sharing some of these concerns that I have had for a long time. With best regards,
