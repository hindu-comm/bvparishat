No, there is no extra lakAra there. It is न् ल् ओ ।

The pronunciations of nasalised आ and आन् are not same;why, even the mAtrAs are different! Further, the duplicated lakAra would be unnecessary if everything else is to remain the same, since unlike other duplications, this would be more tedious to pronounce.

Fortunately, logic is no good to counter the sUtrapramANa, as you see above, I can provide another logical argument. The substitute for tavarga letter, in this case nakAra, is savarNa of the lakAra following, which happens to be a nasalised lakAra. If you go with the former, then you're nasalising the AkAra!
