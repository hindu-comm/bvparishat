Dear Sri Achyut-ji,

  

\> Is it not a tragedy that Sanskrit Professionals are just satisfied with how a word should be written rather than how it is phonated.

  

------ If you followed the discussions closely there was no discussion at all about how to write. It is all about how to pronounce only.

  

Please note how Dr H N Bhat says,

  

" anunasika lakaara replacing anunasika nakaara as per the rule which is represented लँ which was not available in print for halved ल्."
