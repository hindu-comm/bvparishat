Namaste  

  

My wishes to one and all on the occasion of International Day of Yoga.  

  

**योगो हि प्रभवाप्ययौ -**

**Yoga is birth and Yoga is Death.**

  

This Enigmatic statement is found in the kaṭhopaniṣad (2.3.1). For many days I wondered how this could be - then, finally, using my poetic license and also based on the teachings of Yogasūtra I try to reason out
how this could be in this सप्तश्लोकी. 

  

The text and translation of my Samskrita compostion is found in this link - **<https://alarka-bhasitam.blogspot.com/2019/06/yogo-hi-prabhavapyayau-yoga-is-birth.html>**
