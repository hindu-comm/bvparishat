Dear Sarojaji,

  

I am not saying that the composers of the Shiksha or Pratishakyas did not know the 18 अण्s. What I am saying is that the 18 अण् as envisioned in the Shikashas as in vogue today are at variance than those envisioned in the Mahabhashya. This discrepancy at least needs to be recognized if not addressed.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
