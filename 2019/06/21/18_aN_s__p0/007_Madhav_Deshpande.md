The distinctions between hrasva, dīrgha, pluta, udātta, anudātta, svarita, anunāsika and ananunāsika are specifically mentioned in various rules in the Aṣṭādhyāyī, though Pāṇini does not take the next step to give us the count of 18 varieties. This is the group of related sounds that is mentioned by Patañjali with works like sarvam avarṇakulam.
Pāṇini's rules like iko hrasvo'ṅyo gālavasya etc. refer to the practice of some of the other previous or contemporary teachers, and the details of these rules suggest that they had somewhat similar terminology. The rule of Vyāḍi and Gālava in the place of Pāṇini's iko yaṇ aci reads ikāṃ yaṇbhir vyavadhānaṃ vyādi-gālavayoḥ, suggests that the grammatical systems of Vyāḍi and Gālava had the pratyāhāras ik and yaṇ, something only possible if their grammars had Sūtrās similar to the Śivasūtras.
This is just a brief answer to the original question.
