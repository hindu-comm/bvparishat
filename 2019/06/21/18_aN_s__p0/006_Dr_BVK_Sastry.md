Namaste Bhat ji,



You are right in capturing the intent of the question as ' पाणिन्युपज्ञा एवैते भदाः किम्?' 

Karve's question points to this : ' ***When*** were the 18 अण् ***counted*** as .... the total multiplied by two as non nasalized and nasalized ***for the first time***\> ?

The question seems to be about the ***Time line*** and ***Resource*** , with an intention to know Panini's intervention and contribution over ' Pre-Paninian ( prior to 700 BCE) tradition.

Is this a classification specific -special to Paninian technicality or an inheritance, which may be from any or many of Vedic resources , Pratishakhya's,, Pre-Panini Vyakarana's, Music, ... et al.

Look forward for your specific scholarly views pl.

Regards

BVK Sastry
