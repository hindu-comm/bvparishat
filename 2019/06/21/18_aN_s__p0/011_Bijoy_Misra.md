It has been blessing to receive the discourse on various topics from Prof Korada.

His immense depth of the scriptures and his dedication to deal with questions

has made me an admirer.

I quote the following from his last post;

Guessing different things - - without studying ancient शास्त्र-s and without approaching गुरु=s , does not help much .

The answer to the question is --- **अनादि  
**

**  
**

All knowledge possibly began as guesses. The genius of India is that such guesses were analyzed and we can

assume that we are left with what have been empirically proved to be true, I have always have difficulty with the

process of counting and digitization. This has to do with labeling and categorization. I have so far failed to

locate any literature on the origin of counting.  We can only count when we can reduce objects to indices.  

I would request all our friends to help me in this quest.

  

Some guesses have been arbitrarily imposed lately by our friend Indologists in the west. It started in eighteenth

century and continues. Lately it infests our English-savvy scholars in India. There is a tendency to invoke

correlations and make uncultivated conjectures. There are some who wish to validate the scriptural analysis

by the modern scientific findings in different fields.

  

As Prof Korada states our first task is to churn the scriptures and understand the empiricism of observation.

We do not know the process of observation, but we can safely say that it must have taken several hundred years

for any empirical knowledge to be accepted to be coded. So, in my opinion, our approach would be to tally the  

modern results in the framework of the scriptural empiricism, accepting them as scientific through continuous

observation and analysis.

  

I am on my way to India on a family emergency. I might be in touch as time would permit.  

  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
