It's nothing like Sanskrit original; it's a mere translation of Victor Cousin's French book - lectures to be more exact - *Du vrai du beau et du bien,* 1853 You'll find it on the web.

Incidentally, Rabindranath Tagorerefusedto admitthis translated adage; he preferred the Upanishadic adjectives, anantam,apaapaviddham,, amRtamnaanam ,s'ivamsatyam, but not sundaram, which is nowhere to be found in relation to *brahma*.
