Respected Prof. Aklujkar,

  

Thanks for all the relevant references from the BVP and Indology lists.

  

This counters the view that the three word phrase is a modern coinage.

  

Sri Vishal-ji's reference that receives your emphatic support is an eye opener.

  

Thanks again,

  

Deep regards,
