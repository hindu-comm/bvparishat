Dear Prof. Paturi,

  

Perhaps you have the following BVP post from our highly impressive contributor Nityanand Misra in mind:

  

From: Nityanand Misra \<[nmi...@gmail.com]()\> Subject: {भारतीयविद्वत्परिषत्} Re: "सत्यं शिवं सुन्दरम्"(?), "यत् पिण्डे तद् ब्रह्माण्डे" (?) Date: 11 May, 2014. "I know of the usage of the first phrase from 1630 AD. There is a biography of Gosvāmī Tulasīdāsa in the Avadhī language titled Mūla Gosāīm̐ Carita (MGC). The work was composed by Bābā Veṇīmādhava Dāsa, who was a direct disciple of Gosvāmī Tulasīdāsa. The work is dated VS 1687 (1630 AD) by the author, which is seven years after the death of Gosvāmī Tulasīdāsa. A manuscript of the work dated VS 1848 (1791 AD) exists, based on which Gita Press, Gorakhpur, published its first edition of MGC in 1934 AD (which was priced at five paise, those were the days when the Rāmacaritamānasa by Gita Press was priced at two rupees). The book is available on DLI, barcode 99999990233861. In the work occurs a record of a miracle in the life of Gosvāmī Tulasīdāsa when the Paṇḍitas of Vārāṇasī decided to ‘test’ the worth of the Rāmacaritamānasa by placing it under the Vedas and other scriptures in the sanctum sanctorum of the Kāśī Viśvanātha temple in Vārāṇasī. The doors were locked, and when they were opened in the morning, the Paṇḍitas found the words satyaṃ śivaṃ sundaram inscribed on the manuscript, and also heard the words in a voice, supposedly of Kāśī Viśvanātha Himself. So one can say the phrase was used in 1630 AD by Bābā Veṇīmādhava Dāsa, whether one believes in the miracle or not. Some scholars do not consider the MGC to be authentic. If one agrees with this view, then all one can say is that the MGC was composed not earlier than 1630 AD and not later than 1791 AD when the manuscript dates from. Please see the attached snapshots from the book (1934 edition of the MGC by Gita Press), and also the following references: Lamb, Ramdas (July 2002).

An earlier valuable discussion occurred on the Indology-Liverpool list:13 May 2000 17:43:22 EDT. In this post, Shri Vishal Agarwal brilliantly observed: "The concepts of Satyam-Shivam-Sundaram are found in the order shivam-sundaram-satyam in the following Riks :RV 5.82.5-7.” This provided an important corrective to my post13 May 2000 16:59:47 +0100 on the same forum.
