Dear Mārcis,

  

Hariom.

  

If your interest is in the types of non-celestial weaponry used, there are plenty of sources and museums that house these.

  

If you are looking to understand the principles behind celestial weaponry, much of academic research and what is documented is of little practical value since critical information is never passed on in written form and lineages maintain an oath of secrecy for good reason.

Varma Kalai/ Marma (in Kerala) is the science of secret spots in the body used to harm and heal. This was a well known science, in olden times but the masters these days only reveal the exact spots and techniques to open them only after testing disciples thoroughly over many years. Unfortunately the potential for misuse is great.

Celestial weapons are a few levels above this which makes them deadly in the hands of one who can wield them.

It is highly unlikely that any lineage holder of these mystic arts even if they exist in this forum will advertise themselves.

  

There is a popular old saying in Tamizh:

  

கண்டவர் விண்டிலர்; விண்டவர் கண்டிலர்!

  

kaNDavar viNdilar; viNdavar kaNDilar!

Loosely translated it goes like this-->

Those who have "seen" do not speak of it and those who speak have not "seen"

  

This holds very true in such matters.

  

If you want practical pointers from people who know something about this, there is no option other than to rough it out literally.

I will give you some pointers for you to investigate if you are interested.

  

1\. A sadhu around 1973-75 had the ability to create fire that could not be put out by 'normal' means by use of the agneyastra mantra. I believe this made it into the papers of that time and he was even 'investigated' by the scientists of that time who had to admit that they did not know how he did it..implying that they could not detect fraud. This happened around Pune area and maybe those who lived there around that time can cast more light on the matter. Refer to old newspapers and editors to get more leads if you wish.

  

2\. Recently there were reports of writings on celestial weaponry found in palm leaf manuscripts in Kerala atCheriya NarayananNamboodirivaidya's place. I know Krishna Kumar the scholar who worked there. If interested let me know and I can share his contact after checking with him.

  

3\. Ramana Maharshi's disciple Kavya kanta Ganapati muni was a great mantrin who wrote that he had discovered the entire corpus of Dhanurvidya and celestial weoponry hidden openly in the Rg Veda. He however was prohibited by his upasya devI from revealing the same since the time had not yet come for the knowledge to be revealed.

  

  

  

Happy trails...
