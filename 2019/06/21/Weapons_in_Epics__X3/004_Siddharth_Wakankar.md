It could be Gayatri Nandan Pant who wrote on Arms and Armoury.

  

He met me in Vadodara in 1990s when I gave him a copy of the English book on Pratap Shastragar preserved in the Laxmi Vilas Palace of the Gaekwads.

  

At that time,I think,he was in the National Museum,Delhi.

  

Afterwards,we never met or corresponded.

  

Best luck.
