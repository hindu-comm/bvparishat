One Shri Pant, possibly, Devaki Nandan Pant or so,,who was working years ago in the National Museum in Delhi wrote and published from Delhi some volumes titled,Arms and Armoury in Ancient India.

  

The Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad III had a huge collection of arms which formed the Pratap Shastragar in the Palace at Baroda( now, Vadodara). There are two books on this collection of arms,one each in Gujarati and English.

  

You may contact the descendants of the Maharaja for further details.

You may address your letter to Maharani Shubhanginidevi Gaekwad, Laxmi Vilas Palace,Vadodara-390001- Gujarat.

  

You may see their website also for other contact details.

  

I may add that Shubhanginidevi is the Chancellor of the Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda,Vadodara.

  

If you so wish, you can refer to my name.

  

Best luck in your search.  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
