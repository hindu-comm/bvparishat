Sankalia's 'Ramayana in Historical Perspective' has some valuable remarks on weapons. Incidentally, the discus ('chakra') which is Krishna's weapon of choice was apparently used quite extensively down to the time of the Sikhs. English description of the Sikh wars do contain remarks on how the discus, they called it the steel quoit, was used.

  

Indian mythological films never showed the discus realistically. However a James Bond film 'Octopussy' has a few realistic scenes of the steel disc being used. It's as scary as in the story of Sisupalavadha and other stories.

  

Hope this helps,
