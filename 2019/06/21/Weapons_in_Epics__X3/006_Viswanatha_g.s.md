Dear sir,

I am a retired electrical engineer,

My knowledge in Sanskrit literature is limited. But I am a student in samaveda, as such I am in this group.

I am keen in pursuing the studies of the Veda and modern science.

I am interested in knowing your work with general interest .

Thanks

Viswanatha.
