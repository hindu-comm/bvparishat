"sentence" is not a technical unit. It is the duration of the segmentation process of the analog thought.

No experimental work has been done yet.  

The difficulty is that there is a fundamental difference between writing and speaking. The

time processes of the creation of the word and the phrases are suppressed in writing.

When we read and contemplate, we reconstruct the processes. That is where lies the science.  

We are gradually discovering the brain functioning time scales.

The segment (sentence) is likely a part of a longer structure which is wave-like (melody)

  

I posted a video of a seminar we did in Dec. You can study. Our progress is slow.

We report as we learn. We did a paper in the last Sanskrit Conf at Vancouver last year.

I am forwarding a copy privately.

  

Thank you.
