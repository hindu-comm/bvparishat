Dear friends,

  

Every two weeks on Fridays I read Valmiki in my journey to recreate

the poet and his thoughts. This morning I did. I wanted to share some

of my basic impressions.

  

The first is that the meaning of a poetic line is its enjoyment and not

in its story line understanding. This dichotomy has bothered me from

a neurological point of view thinking if a vocal sound is designed to be

enjoyed. We enjoy bird sounds, animal sounds, tree sounds, water  

sounds and air sounds. From this view, the human sounds should be  

no different, as a matter of similarity.  

  

The difference comes between natural expression and business expression.

The natural expression is involuntary whereas the business expression is

voluntary. The latter has an element of communication style to hide the  

intention and confuse the recipient.  In modern neurology, this has been

factored into a hypothetical module called "intentionality" whose biological

origin and anatomical location remain to be discovered.

  

The ability to have a subjective intentionality is human in origin. The free

self-expression emanates from objective intentionality and the business

expression is linked to subjective intentionality. The latter is peculiar to

humans developed as a tool to survive using voice manipulation than using

in-built strength or muscle skills.

  

This is where I come to the Indian observation that all sound expressions

are natural with meanings associated to neurological maps. These maps  

can be grouped and bundled by some internal grammar protocol to create

words and phrases which by the same token have to be meaningful. The  

rules for such grouping is not known at the present time. We only know  

how such words are used in language, discovering a grammar in uttering

the vocal sounds.  

  

The problem comes when we try to create the map in our brain by using the

word as a stimulus. We fail and check what others think etc. So comes a

dictionary. In the picture of objective intentionality, our own brain is our own

dictionary. The discovery becomes easier when we know the full context of

the word, which is the knowledge of the sentence. From the neural processing  

point of view, the sentence is the basic unit of cognitive comprehension. The

sentence helps in transcending from the subjective perception to an asymptotic  

objective comprehension. This gets lost in word-based understanding.  

  

This has been a long post. Let me stop here.  

  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
