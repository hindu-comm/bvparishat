Respected members,

NamAMsi bhUyAMsi

  

One of my friends has a name 'Ajamila'. He asked me to get the etymological meaning of his name. I will be grateful if someone can help me in this regard.

  

( I believe everyone knows the story of Ajamila, still for a easy reference sake I am mentioning it here. Pls don't mind. The story of brahmana named 'Ajamila' appears in Srimad-Bhagavata-Purana, skanda 6, chapter 1, who got degraded due to associating with a prostitute, and finally got delivered by Vishnu-dutas at the time of his death)

  

das,

Jaya Nityananda Dasa Brahmachari
