Dear all,

Happy to share one of my articles(2014).

For the convenience of discerning and selective readers, full text of the abstract is given below.

  

Kelallur Nilakantha Somayaji (15th -16th century CE) is a prominent member of the mathematical tradition that flourished in Central Kerala during 13th to 18th centuries CE. This tradition is said to have originated thoughts on Calculus. Nilakantha is well known as the author of Tantrasangraha and Atyabhatiyabhasya. But his works (all written in Sanskrit) are yet to be analysed from the angles of the philosophy of maths and conceptual history. The facts that his language resembles any of the classical works on Philosophy and that his works contain many quotations from Mimamsa Philosophy expressing mathematical ideas are less noticed.  
THIS PAPER, WITH FULL DOCUMENTATION SHOWS THAT HE HAD BEEN HOLDING A CRITICAL AND RATIONAL

APPROACH TOWARDS THE DISCIPLINE OF ASTRONOMY.
