Respected Mr. Nori,

              I am greatly indebted to you for getting the source of the sentence 'अङ्कानां वामतो गतिः' and I have already downloaded one copy of Muhurta Mala from internet the source of which is Digital Library of India. But as some front pages of that downloaded book are perhaps missing, I could not know the name of the original writer of that book. Can you kindly help me in this regard Sir ? S. Sinha.
