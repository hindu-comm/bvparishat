Sirs,

While reading some explanation about the date of Abhinavagupta in a book, I went through some comment that 'जलधि' = 4. Can anyone may further explain the matter to me in detail i.e. why the word'जलधि' stands for the figure 4. The word 'जलधि' is mentioned in the last Śloka of ईश्वरप्रत्यभिज्ञाविवृतिविमर्शिनी of Abhinavagupta.

                                   
       With a lot of thanks.

                                   
          S. Sinha
