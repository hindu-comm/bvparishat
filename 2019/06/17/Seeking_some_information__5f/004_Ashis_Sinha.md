Respected Sirs,

  I don't know how I shall express my gratitude to you all who have kindly and very quickly supplied me the proper information regarding the maxim 'अङकानां वामतो गति:' and ' जलधि' which stands for figure 4. I have found out the maxim 'अङकानां वामतो गति:' and ' जलधि' which stands for figure 4 inमुहूर्तमाला by Maheswar Sharama as suggested by you. Hope that in future I shall be continuing to get more information from you for my study of Sanskrit. Yours faithfully, S. Sinha.
