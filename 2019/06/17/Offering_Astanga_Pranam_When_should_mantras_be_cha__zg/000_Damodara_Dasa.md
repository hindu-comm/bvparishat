Hare Krishna.

  

Respected Vidvaj-janas,

Pranams.

  

It is a famous verse that describes 8 limbs of astanga pranam:

urasa sirsa drstya manasa vacasa tatha

padbhyam urubhyam bahubhyam pranamo 'stanga iritah.

  

Here it is understood that vacasa means reciting pranama-mantras.

I would like to know the practice of astanga pranama in different traditions like Sankara, Ramanuja, Madhva etc.

  

Are the pranama-mantras chanted while one is flat on the ground or before or after one is flat on the ground?

  

Also if someone can throw some light on how drsti is involved in offering pranam? Is it that first one has to take darsana of the deity we are offering pranam to? Or that one has to close one's eyes? Or it refers to philosophical understanding that one should consider while offering pranam?

  

Thankyou,

Hari Guru Vaisnava das,

damodara das
