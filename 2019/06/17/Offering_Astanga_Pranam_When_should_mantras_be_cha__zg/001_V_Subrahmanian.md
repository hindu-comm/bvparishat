In the Shankara sampradaya I have seen the namaskara, falling flat, done after chanting the mantra, for instance, 'na karmaNaa na prajayaa........maheshwarah'. While on the ground one can contemplate on the Lord's feet, form, etc.

  

Even while prostrating before elders, first the abhivaadaye....with gotra, name etc are uttered, the namaskara is done after the oral uttering.

We can reasonably hold that the sa-ashtaanga involves all these at one or the other point of time and not necessarily 'during' the falling flat posture, as it is impossible to have the drishti of the deity/elder/sannyasin then.

  

From the definition shloka it is clear that it is 'kaayaa vaachaa manasaa indriyaih..' namaskara.
