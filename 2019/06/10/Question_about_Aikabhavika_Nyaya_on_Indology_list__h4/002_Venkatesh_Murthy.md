'Apart from these, there is also the prArabdha karma. Generally, prArabdha refers to the enjoyment of the fruits of the karma performed in previous birth/s, in the current birth. While dealing with prArabdha karma, there are two theories. The first group, called aikabhavika pakSha, states the following: The sum total of all the karma performed in the previous birth is the current birth. The fruits of karma performed in this birth should be completely enjoyed in the next birth. There is no concept of accumulating karma over several births. This theory is refuted by most of the prominent schools of thought. '
