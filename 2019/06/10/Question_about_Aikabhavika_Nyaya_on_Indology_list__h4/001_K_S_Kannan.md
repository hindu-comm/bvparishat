I suspect it could be *aikabhavika-**nayena***.

*Aikabhavika* seems to be a school of Mimamsa.

  

No wonder if Madhusudana Sarasvati rejected the poser :  

Who on earth can confidently say "I will exhaust all the *karman*-s"?  

Cf.  

*anubhavitum aghaugham nAlam AgAmi-kAlaH*

*pras'amayitum as'es"am nis"kriyAbhir na s'akyam \|*
