Dear all

  

My, Sanskrit Scholar friend Karthik has written a script using Matlab to convert Srilipi Sanskrit text which is typeset in Shree SAN 960 or 962 or 964 texts to Unicode (Matlab is not meant for these purposes hence it runs slowly)

  

Install Octave for Windows(Windows only)

create a folder, copy all the attached files.

create a text file with extension as d.bin

copy and paste your input in the d.bin

run the script

get the output.

enjoy!

  

Regards

KP
