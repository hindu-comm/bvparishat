Dear scholar friends,

The last discussion about the daily rituals did bring up the memory of

a late monk of Ramakrishna Mission who served the Boston Center from  

1954 to 2009. Swami Sarvagatananda came from a scholarly family in

Andhra Pradesh and was influenced through Mahatma Gandhi as a kid.  

He studied the sciences and became an Accountant in Bombay. He joined

the Ramakrishan Mission in Bombay and took care of the Ramakrishna

Hospital in Kankhal in Himachal Pradesh. After a tour at Karachi during  

the partition, he came to the US. He served as a Hindu Religious Counselor

at MIT where I met him in 1978, when I was organizing a fundraising after

the cyclone devastation in Andhra that year. He did massive fundamental work

in lecturing on Vedanta and helping to organize the Indian community abroad.

I did a memorial tribute through a website in 2016. Sharing here

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
