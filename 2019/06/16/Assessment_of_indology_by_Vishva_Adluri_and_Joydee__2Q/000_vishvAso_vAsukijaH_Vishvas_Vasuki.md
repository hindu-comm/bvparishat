\- Source for the below here: <https://www.academia.edu/39571145/Prolegomena_to_Any_Future_Mah%C4%81bh%C4%81rata_Studies> - some points have been rearranged for convenience.  
  
Indology failed not from the perspective of Indian tradition, which has continued largely unaffected. Neither did it fail from the perspective of Sanskrit, which produced a wealth of literature, which anyone today can read and which will exist long after the last Indologist.  
  
Indology failed from the perspective of the claims  
it itself asserted: science, university discipline, humanities, European tradition, and history.  
  
- (1) Indology is not a science; neither did Indologists have any clue of what “science” is.  
- (3) Indology failed to contribute to the humanities, especially if we regard the cultivation of aesthetic sensibility, broad-mindedness, openness to other cultures, humility, ethics, etc. as the goal of humanities education.  
- (4) Most Indologists are ignorant of broad movements in European intellectual history and philosophy; they keep telling themselves they are important and European, but this posture only works in front of Indians.  
- (5) Indologists are ignorant of their own history: for all that they propagate the idea of Indology as a “historical-critical” discipline, they failed to engage in either historical self-reflection or self-critique. Ultimately, this is the real reason Indology failed as evinced by the rapid closure of departments.  
 - (2) No one at German universities recognizes Indology; despite belaboring the parallel with classical philology, Indologists are figures of ridicule to classicists.
