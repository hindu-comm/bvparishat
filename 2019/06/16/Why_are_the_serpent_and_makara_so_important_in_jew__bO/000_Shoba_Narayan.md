Namaste:

I am researching why the serpent and the makara motif so important in Indian jewellery.

  

We have the Pampadam jewellery of Tamilnadu where women with elongated earlobes wear this type of earrings. Pambu means snake. Similarly the Jadai-nagam. The question is: why the snake and not other reptiles like the frog or lizard in jewellery?

  

We have makara kundalam and makara-kanti necklaces. I know that makara was the vahana of varuna and gangadevi and have read the previous posts on this topic about the samudra being referred to as makaralayam. But why did our ancients choose the makara as opposed to other amphibians to celebrate and refer to? What is special about the makara? Is it a composite animal as some have indicated or a species that actually existed and went extinct?

  

I am looking for textual references about why the sarpa and the makara are so important in Indian culture. Why do we worship the snake and not the lizard?

  

As background, I am a journalist and amateur Sanskrit enthusiast. I have written a book on cows in which many scholars in this group helped with my understanding. I also worked with Shaale.com to do The Sanskrit Podcast on youtube. I live in Bangalore.

  

Thank you for the help.
