Hi Irene,

Thanks much for the response. I am looking for the complete book. I couldn't find the same in archive. But I m not sure if its feasible to scan all the pages...

  

I did downlad the other book that you have mentioned, but it seems to be the history of 'tantra in bengal' only.

  

Thanks again for your time.

  

Regards,

Ganesh.
