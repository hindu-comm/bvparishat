What is the Sanskrit word for saffron?

In Malayalam, the saffron flower is called kuṅkuma pū

The edible saffron powder is called kuṅkuma poṭi (pronounced poḍi, meaning powder)

The typical color of the robes of a Sādhu or Sannyāsi, or the color of BJP’s flag, is kāvi, or in more Sanskritized Malayalam, kāṣāyaṃ, although this color is translated into English as also saffron.

The kuṅkumam that ladies wear on their forehead is obviously a different material than the edible saffron which is also called kuṅkumam in Malayalam. What is the Sanskrit for the former (that which the ladies wear on their foreheads)?

I believe the Hindi for edible saffron is Kesar.
