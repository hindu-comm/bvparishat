We have the famous Sri Venkateswara Suprabhatam line:

  

कमलाकुच-चूचुक-कुंकमतोनियतारुणितातुलनीलतनो ।  

  

This kumkuma is not applied on the forehead, as per this line; it is applied on the breasts. So this must be a Kumkuma different from the popular kumkuma. This could be related to the kesari kashmira kumkuma.
