The book's layout is like this: In Brahma sutras, called also Vedanta sutras, the topics are lined up in sections called adhikaraNam. This book takes up each of these adhikaranams and presents briefly what is said by the three schools of Shankara, Ramanuja and Madhva about that topic. Under one topic we get to read the interpretation according to the three schools just one after the other. It is not something like you finish reading Shaankara doctrine as per the entire Brahma sutra and then enter to explore the Ramanuja school and then Madhva. We get to learn what the three schools say on each topic then and there itself.

  

As attested by a renowned Vishishtadvaita scholar, the book presents the dotrine (s) in a lucid way by trying to avoid technical terms as far as possible.

  

A study of the book, I think, will certainly be profitable to someone who wants to know what the three schools say in their doctrines.
