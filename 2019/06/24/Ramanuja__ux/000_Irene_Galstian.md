Dear list,  
  
It seems that Ramanuja is often read as a source of alternative opinion to Sankara. But what if I wanted to read him on his own terms? Could you please suggest books or papers? If they are in Indian languages, that would be very nice too, so the query isnâ€™t limited to European scholarship and translations.  
Thank you for considering this request.  
  
Irene
