Prof. Galstian,

  

I would suggest the following two books:

  

1\. Yamunacharya, "Ramanuja's teaching in his own words," Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan.

2\. S. S. Ragavachar, "The Vedarthasangrahah," R. K. Mutt - available online at<http://estudantedavedanta.net/Vedartha-Sangraha.pdf>

  

The latter is a translation of Bhagavan Ramanuja's work along with the original text in Devanagari. It's a very nicely done translation. Of course every Hindu author has criticisms of other schools and this is no exception, but still it still focuses on what Bhagavan Ramanuja thought most important.

  

The former is a very delightful book with no polemics at all and focuses on Bhagavan Ramanuja's philosophy. It has an appendix with the extracts used for the exposition at the end of the book in Devanagari. It's one of the nicest introductory books I have read (not just related to Visishtadvaita).
