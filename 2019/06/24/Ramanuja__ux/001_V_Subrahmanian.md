

Since you are asking about a book in an Indian language, there is a newly published book that states the three siddhantas, doctrines, of Shankara, Ramanuja and Madhva, in a precise manner, based on the sections/adhikaraNa-s of the Brahma sutras, in Tamil. For each sutra the doctrine of each of the three Acharya-s has been stated, as per their respective schools. If you can read Tamil, I can help you procure the book.
