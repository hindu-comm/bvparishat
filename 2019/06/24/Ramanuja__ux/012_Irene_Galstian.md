Dear Ramakrishnan,

  

Thank you for the suggestions, your description of these books sounds helpful and inviting.

I’m not a professor though, just an ordinary person. When I read ‘Prof. Galstian’ in your message, it made me think of my late grandfather, Suren Galstian, who was a professor and a highly regarded surgeon.

  

Best wishes,

Irene
