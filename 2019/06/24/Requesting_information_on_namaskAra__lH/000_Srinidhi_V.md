Respected Scholars,

  

I am looking for a resource/s that describes methods and types of Namaskara (Pranama) in Hindu practice including its basis and how/why does it vary between deities, traditions, gender and any such other parameters. I am requesting this information mostly from the perspective of rituals and not just in the form of contemporary greetings.

  

Any pointers to originals texts dealing with this and/or modern compilation of the same would be deeply appreciated.

  

Also, I request pointers on how other religious sects of India (Sikh, Buddhist, Jain and others) or outside (Muslims, Christians, Jews and others) look at the notion of Namaskara or an equivalent of it.

  

Thank you very much.

  

Regards,

Srinidhi
