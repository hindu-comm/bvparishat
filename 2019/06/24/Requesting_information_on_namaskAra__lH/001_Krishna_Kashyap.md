There is a book "namaskara" written on this subject in Kannada by Vidwan Shankaranarayana Jois. I have read it. It is very informative.

You can contact Sri NEELAKANTA.his phone number is : [+91 94499 63379](tel:+91%2094499%2063379)

If you go to that place to pick up the book, you can ask for other books. see more info:<http://www.ayvm.in/contactus.php>

These are from Ashtanga yoga vijnana mandira.

You can see the book list in this website. It is better if you visit that place in bangalore or mysore. You can find a number of good books on several subjects.
