Cambridge-published Tirthankar Roy's (2012) book *[India in the World Economy – From Antiquity to the Present](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/india-in-the-world-economy/9079E07A2697FB6A122BEBFE3CC6FA13)* is presented, amongst other things, as:  

  
1. "global history written on India's terms,"  
2. covering a period "from Antiquity to the Present".  
  
The validity of these two claims is analysed in this [critique](https://www.academia.edu/37969487/Tirthankar_Roys_2012_India_in_the_World_Economy_From_Antiquity_to_the_Present_Two_observations).
