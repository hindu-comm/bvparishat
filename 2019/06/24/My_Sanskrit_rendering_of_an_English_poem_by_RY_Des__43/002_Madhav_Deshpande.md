Dear Siddhartha Ji,

  

  Thank you so much for your kind words. As some already know, I had a knee replacement surgery on June 18 and now I am back home recovering from this surgery. Yesterday, translating this beautiful poem by R. Y. Deshpande was the best medicine. For a few hours, it transported me into the beatitude of Gokula, and there was no trace of knee pain. No wonder the great Mammaṭa said that *śivetarakṣati*was also a prayojana of poetry. With best regards,
