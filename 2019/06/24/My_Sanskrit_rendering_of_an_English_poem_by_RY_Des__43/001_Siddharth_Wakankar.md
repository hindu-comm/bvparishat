Dear Prof. Madhavbhau and Prof.Deshpande ji,

  

I have no words to adequately express my feelings to appreciate your genius. You have a heart of a poet as well as of a connoisseur.

It is reflected in your poetic compositions.

  

Best luck to both of you for your poetic fancy and your sincere efforts to enrich us.

  

Prof.Siddharth. Y. Wakankar.
