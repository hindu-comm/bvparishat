Dear Madhavbhau,

  

I never knew about your health.



I am reminded of that great effort by a Maharashtrian gentleman( unfortunately,I forgot his name) who prepared some 60/70 years back two volumes of Subhashita Koshas, wherein the original Sanskrit shlokas were translated in Samavrutta and Gangalahari too. At that time,he had suffered a heart attack and during that ordeal in those days,he decided to devote his time to translating into Marathi the treasure of Subhashitas.

  

Yes,his name is Dr. La. Go. Vinze.

  

At times,our illness is a blessing in disguise and goads or encourages us to have some time.pass or pastime of this nature.

  

Wish you early recovery.

  

Best luck and warm regards with a lot of thanks.

  

Prof.Siddharth Y.Wakankar.
