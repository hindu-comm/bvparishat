Namaskaaraha !

  

Dear Respected Scholars,

I am looking for some references and sources (Translations, Editions, Researches and Articles etc.) on **Pavanaduta**. Actually, I am very much interested in the messenger literature in Sanskrit. Therefore, I kindly request to you all please give me some information regarding this topic.

  

Thank you very much.
