Dear list,  
  
Please help me work out which translations were done by H D Velankar.  
He seems to have started off by translating hymns to specific deities  
in the 1930s, but then entire Mandalas were published by the  
University of Bombay in the 1960s. I think I managed to find Man 2, 3,  
5, 7.  
But what about 4 and 6? Were they ever published in their entirety?  
  
Best wishes,  
Irene
