ऐ ऐ टि-एम् (IIT-M)-तन्त्र-विज्ञान-धाम्नि  

 "सत्"(Sant)-पीठ-प्राध्यापकत्वे (Chair-Professorship) नियुक्ते ।

आशासानास्स्वस्तिवाचो मयीत्थं

 सत्यं वन्द्याः पारिषद्या उदाराः ॥

  

I am greatly beholden to the numerous generous scholars of the Parishat

for their kind words of blessing - upon my being conferred the **first** occupancy of  

the honoured Sant Rajinder Singh Ji Maharaj Chair-Professorship

at the Indian Institute of Technology - Madras,

recently accredited as **the No. 1** academic institution in the entire country.

  

The Chair is also **the first one** in  

the Dept. of Humanities and Social Sciences

in the esteemed institute.

  

Many more top scholars like Prof. Vineet Chaitanya-ji, Prof. Jha and Prof. Aklujkar - to name but a few,

sent their good wishes through personal e-mails.

  

It is these words of benediction that inspire me and strengthen me  

to give the best of myself.

  

I welcome suggestions from all quarters,

even though I may have limitations on what I can do.

(Rather than clutter this honoured platform,

kindly send the suggestions to my personal email-id).  

  

Regards,

KSKannan
