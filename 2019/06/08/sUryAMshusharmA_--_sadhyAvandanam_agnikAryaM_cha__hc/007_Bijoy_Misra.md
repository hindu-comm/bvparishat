Dear Prof Wakanker,

By being abroad, we do think about the scheduling and observing. I served as a Trustee at the local

Hindu Temple for many years and the issues of rituals and scheduling did become an issue to deal

with. After studying the Gita with the help of a monk from Ramakrishna Mission and reflecting  

yoga through another teacher, i got convinced that we are wholesome all the time. We would get

better peace or better connectivity through astronomical timings, which would be purely sensory.

But the empowerment of the human being through physical existence could be where spirituality

might rest. I wrote about this in a book entitled "Sri Krishna Yoga" (2005, reprint 2010) published  

by the Advaita Press, Mayavati and available through Ramakrishna Mission and Amazon. I also  

spoke on this in a public lecture here in Boston last month.

But this is strictly a personal opinion and thought.

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
