Comparing Sanatana dharma with the Catholic church is not an apples-apples comparison.

Christianity and its denominations are governed by a central authority(s) and dogma that is faith based and not emperical (atleast in its mainstream form).

There is no question of regimentation in sanatana dharma since there is NO central authority to regiment anyone.

The word you are looking for is self-regulation since Dharma is always personal.

No religious scholar however well read has the adhikara to supplant what the Rshis of one's lineage have given and propose work arounds.

Yad yad acharati sreshtah...Adhikara is not gained by study of the scriptures or knowledge of the language alone but through tapasya,
purvakarma and divine will. Tapasya involves japa, homa, tarpana and whatever litany of rituals that are prescribed to get the individual free of deva, pitru and other rNas so that he can enter objectively into the philosophical dimension.

  

I do not fault the people of Trinidad or Madagascar for what they do wrt desha, kala etc. But to say or imply that sandhyavandana / other practices are to be modernised for the jet-setting brahmin of kaliyuga is not tenable. Frankly as master Yoda would put it, either Do or Don't do. There is no try.

  

I know many people who have worked for IBM, Accenture and travel 3-4 days a week who not only do sandhyavandana but also maintain an agnihotra fire.

There are many agnihotris who actively make a choice to not "make a living" chasing the dollar so that they can stay at home, do trikala sandhya, Brahma Yajna and agnihotra.

This is a matter of choice. Not coercion.

  

Let me explain: When performing the Nityakarmas mostly the yajnopavita is worn on the left shoulder (except while giving rshi and pitru tarpanas) this implies a domination of Shiva over Shakti implying that Shakti or energy is accumulated.

When performing shraddha karma -pitru tarpana etc the the yajnopavita is on the right shoulder where Shakti dominates over Shiva implying that energy is given away.

  

So in all instances where people who do not do nityakarma but perform shraddha / pitru tarpana etc, they are basically sending cheques to pitris with a zero balance in their a/c. The bounced cheque may not result in litigation, but it does result in pitru shaapa. When pitri shaapa comes home to roost, it destroys the family.

  

There is plenty of empirical experience in ritualism that is beyond the imagination of those who have never done these. There is always a context to this that cannot be rationalised within the paradigms of the bhautika dimension.
