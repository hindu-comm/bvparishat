Really? Going by Apastamba - it is only 12 mAsi shrAddha-s, an aShTakA and and anvaShTakA. Is this some paurANika suggestion? Then one might add 4-7 eclipses and other occassions such as (12) sankramaNa-s - though I'd view those as optional.

tarpaNa (even with just water) has to be done daily, of course.

Not speaking about this particular case, but more generally, while many of the supposed shortcuts are really just a matter of skipping OPTIONAL components of ritual. Such as having to remove some curse on the gAyatrI mantra and show some mudra-s while doing japa (which is said to be essential if one takes the statements as vidhis rather than as arthavAda). Such excess complication takes time and motivation away from the essential, required simple rituals (eg vaishvadeva) - and so must by avoided by most people IMO.
