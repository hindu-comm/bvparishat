Dear Shri Korada Garu:

  

As usual, you have hit the ball out of the stadium.

  

Just to clarify my original comment, this was not about the regularity of a child's sandhyavandana (in this case your grandson). Children have too many distractions and cannot be expected to know right from wrong.

  

My only point was that such a one as yourself cannot use the hopeful phrase "atleast during vacations" which can give the illusion of a "pass mark" in this field to others.

As Bhagavan said:

यद्यदाचरति श्रेष्ठस्तत्तदेवेतरो जनः ।  
स यत्प्रमाणं कुरुते लोकस्तदनुवर्तते ॥  

  

As you apltly put it, all other worship does not bear fruit if these basics are neglected.

  

Namaskarams.
