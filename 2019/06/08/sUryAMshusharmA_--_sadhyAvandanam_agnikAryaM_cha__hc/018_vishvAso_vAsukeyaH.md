Quite inspiring. It would be beneficial to publish video of his rituals on YouTube. For example, video of a friend's son rushing through samidAdhAnam ( <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyTVAJVNo2U> ) nevertheless inspired some other friend to make his son do it.  

  

I truly hope that the oppressive government prohibition on possession of kRShNAjina goes away.

Yes, one must ask why gRhastha-s don't keep aupAsanAgnI and at least do aupAsana if not sthAlipAkas etc.. despite it being equally easy. ( Videos such as <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkRYT-iTi2c> for Apastambins, <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAv3rDuRbPQ> and <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkv8rZBOhtE> for AshvalAyanas have inspired a few individuals to consult experts and take it up. More such videos are needed.)  
  
Even tretAgnihotra can be done in 25 minutes. People are under some very mistaken impression that all this is very time consuming.
