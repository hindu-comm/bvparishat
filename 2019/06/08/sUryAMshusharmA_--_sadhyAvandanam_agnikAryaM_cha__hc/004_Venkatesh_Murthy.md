Namaste

  

One more example of short cuts is Sraaddha has to be 96 times in a year. But short cut to that is instead of doing entire Sraaddha people started doing only Tila Tarpana. More short cuts followed. Instead of doing Tila Tarpana on 96 days they do it on Amavasya days, Pitru Paksha days and do a Sraadha on Parent's death anniversary. Instead of doing 96 Sraaddhas in a year the result is they do Tila Tarpana on some days and one Sraadha only. More shortcuts. Instead of doing full Sraadha they do not invite Brahmins but use Darbha blades. They may also do this short Sraaddha in a Mutt in a group Sraadha. One priest told people now want even that one Sraadha to be compressed into 15-20 minutes. They don't want to spend an hour and a half.
