Dear Prof..Mishra,

  

As you pointed out, basically every human being is kind,helpful and co.operative. Religious affiliation or following is a very delicate and a personal issue. Nobody likes the other person to interfere with this aspect of his life.

  

I give a very simple example.

  

The Parsis will never allow any non. Parsi - may be his best friend- to enter his kitchen where the fire is kindled. I was told this fact by my best friend who is the Chief Priest- Dastur- of the Tata Fire Temple( agyari,that is, Agni.aagaara) in Mumbai.

  

The same thing applies to our fellow followers of Hinduism.

  

We just should appreciate their efforts in maintaining our culture etc.without questioning their intentions and should follow them,if we so wish, instead of finding fault with some of the short cut methods and be aloof from any controversy.

  

Everybody should be given freedom to follow his inclinations and that is what we generally do.

  

Thanks and regards.  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
