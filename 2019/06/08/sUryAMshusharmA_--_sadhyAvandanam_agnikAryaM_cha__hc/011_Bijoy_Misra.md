I am afraid that some reform would be necessary to reduce regimentation. Catholic church is losing itself through the latter.

Religious scholars have to come together to redefine the Hindu practices that can be accommodated in the present age.

The beauty is that faith does distinguish between philosophy and the rituals.  

For a long time, I worked with a group from Trinidad who kept their faith by smuggling a copy of SriRamacharitamanasa

claiming it a love story (so is legend). After a hundred years of oppression and labor, they have morphed their rituals

into strange hybrid practices. I had to accept them all in their own way.  

A liberal view has to declare that no man is at fault!

Best regards,

BM
