It is a sorry state of affairs that in modern times,we find short cuts for everything,except our cultural and ritual practices or sometimes even in studies.

  

I know of teachers in IITs also who ask or rather recommend to students to download the required matter,without thinking of the authenticity thereof.This is a short cut to success.This kind of copying is also appreciated by the persons at the helm of the institute's also.

  

My teacher always said- quick success easily got by shortcut vanishes equally quickly,but,....

  

This progressively worsening conditionof short cuts in education must be arrested as early as possible for our betterment.  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
