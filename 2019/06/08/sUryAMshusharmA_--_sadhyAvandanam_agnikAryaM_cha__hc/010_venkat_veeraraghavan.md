Dear Shri Wakankar ji-

  

I totally agree that how much achara is followed is a personal decision taken on an individual basis. However, the tenets of dharma shastra cannot be diluted while teaching as per individual convenience. All of dharma is inconvenient. It is preferrable to sleep past sunrise and wake up with bed-coffee. But when someone goes against the grain and offers arghya before the sun rises, it becomes an act of tapasya. It is inconvenient to lay off onion and garlic and fast on ekadashis. But when done the act becomes one of tapasya. Tapasya /prayaschitta is impossible without the element of burning /inconvenience that comes with this. I do not mean this in a masochistic sense but in terms of disciplining the senses. The BG would have gone in a different direction if Bhagavan had deferred to Arjuna's "scruples" and would have ended at Vishaada yoga.

  

The Mahaswami of Kanchi was once approached by a group of "brahmins" protesting the public humiliation of brahmins at the height of the periyar movement in Tamilnadu. The Swami had just one question: "How many of you perform sandhyavandana?" --Not one dared to raise their hand. He smiled and said "Perform trikala sandhyavandana and then let me know if you do not receive respect."

A tiger does not go about demanding respect in the jungle. Its aura is enough to clear its path.

  

Dharma can be explained and given as advice but can never be forced. To do or to not do is the choice and eventual destiny of the individual..As Krishna said towards the end of the BG after 700+ shlokas of back and forth, "yatha icchasi tatha kuru"...."do as you please". 

  

The term yatha shakti has been frequently abused in both sankalpa and achara. Yatha shakti literally means to the limits of one's capacity and intelligence. When one has flu, one cannot perfom pranayama. But what can be realistically done has to be done....which is the understanding.Disambiguation in matters of dharma is good in the sense that people can decide to do or not to do and live with the consequences of both.

  

I apologise if I sound a rather uncompromising note here, but I hear frequently from Brahmin boys blaming Gayatri and Vedic practices without having followed anything in their lives. Gayatri does not give result in kaliyuga they say. Vedas do not give result they say. When asked about their practise they tell me they do isha yoga, anulom-vilom pranayama, Nityananda yoga or chant the xyz Mahamantra. So, without experimenting how did these boys come to the conclusion that Gayatri mantra is powerless or that vedas do not give results in kali?

This is merely a symptom of the lazy intellectualisation that has lead to the confused crisis of spirituality that many "brahmins" find themselves in.

  

Kind regards,
