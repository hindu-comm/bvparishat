Another beautiful exposition by Prof Korada.

Through whatever little I have studied so far, i have come to feel that empirically

it was designed to prepare for self-realization as the goal of human life.

All actions are local. Through austerities and discipline one gradually may

peel through the cover of ignorance to realize one's own true identity.  

गीता said स्वल्पमप्यस्य धर्मस्य त्रायते महतो भयात्.

It has two aspects, the first is - भय exists, living itself is भय.

The second is - practice of धर्म would help us withstand the भय \|

Through our analysis here, we have come up with two principles for धर्म

1\. Principle of acceptance - all objects are free and they have a right to exist.

 We did not cause them, and we cannot destroy them. All we can do, is to accept the universe as given.

 We are recipients of a much larger process. Our existence itself is a grace.

2\. Principle of ignorance - We carry several layers of ignorance.
Ignorance builds in

  life in our effort to survive. The realization of one's own ignorance is the first step of the

  above धर्म. All actions and events have a cause, but we are ignorant of the cause.

 Our interpretations are local. Absolute non-ignorance has no interpretation, it is silent.

  

We are still analyzing if these principles hold in all situations as cosmological principles.

  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
