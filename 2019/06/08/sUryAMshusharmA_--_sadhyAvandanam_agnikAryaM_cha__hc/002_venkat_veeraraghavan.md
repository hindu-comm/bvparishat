Dear Shri Korada garu,

  

It is very much admirable that your grandson does sandhyavandanam. A lot of that ofcourse comes from being born in a family of Vedavidvans and people like you who maintain the tradition as a shining beacon for those who are young and impressionable.

  

I would however with all due respect to yourself take exception to one little statement of yours: "complete सन्ध्यावन्दनम् ,*at least during vacation*" -->Nityakarmas (except agnikaryas) are to be kept up even at the time of asaucha and are not optional for initiates. So the rider *'at least during vacation'* is not acceptable as per shastra.

  

Since we live in a mediocre zeitgeist where we choose to dilute our achara and tapasya to run after faux-riches it is all the more important to keep principles and practices constant. What we keep central to our existence becomes constant as the center of a moving wheel and what we keep peripheral goes up and down. Now, we have a choice on what to keep central and it is this choice alone that defines us.

  

A small story /sthala purana from south Tamilnadu to inspire your grandson and others on the sheer power behind keeping up the achara of trikala sandhyavandana.

The story details are a bit off at each link, but the main details are:

1\. The Chera King suffered from an incurable disease (Hence the name Cheranmahadevi)

2\. The boy who cured him was Kannadiga (Hence the name Kannadian kalvai) Unfortunately the boy did not think it worth giving his name and is known only as Kannadian

3\. All the copper plates regarding the purchase of property using the gold received by the boy to build this kalvai are available for verification and this is no airy myth as it is wont to be disregarded.

  

Nothing is received in this world or the next without hard work, consistency and trust.

  

Kind Regards
