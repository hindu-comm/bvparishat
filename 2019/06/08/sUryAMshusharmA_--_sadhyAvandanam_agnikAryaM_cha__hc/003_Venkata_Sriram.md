Namaste,

  

Few years back, I happened to see a book 'laghu sandhyavandanam'. This was compiled by a one of our distant relatives who was great shrauti and studied purva-mimamsa (Br.Sri. Sathyanarayana Srauti). While writing an introduction to that, he mentioned that this abridged version of sandhya was compiled keeping in view of busy office goers, school kids who are overloaded with home works, tuition, studies etc. The main intent of the work is to see that these 'busy group' doesn't skip sandhya for the 'fear of getting late' to their offices / schools etc. as maintaining attendance and punctuality is also equally important. However, he said that though this book caters to the busy office goers / school kids etc. but they have to learn and do the sandhya completely during public holidays, national festivals and special occasions.

  

So, that Srautigal, in consultation with a great vedic scholar & srividya upasaka Brahmasri. Karra Agnihotra Avadhani Garu, compiled the sandhya ritual. This short, abridged sandhya ritual would take 5-8 minutes along with chanting of gayatri mantra with min. 10 times.

  

This is also called द्राविड सन्ध्यावन्दनम् as this was meant for 'konaseema-draviDAs' , a brahmin community in Coastal Andhra Pradesh who migrated from Tanjavur, Kumbakonam to Andhra Pradesh during the times of Rajaraja Narendra of Rajamahendravaram. He married a girl belonging to Chola dynasty and along with the bride, brahmins of 18 gotras migrated to Andhra.  

  

Several vedic scholars mock at this द्राविड सन्ध्यावन्दनम् owing to short-cuts in ritual. There was a heated discussion on this by Nyaya Vedanta Scholar of Andhra, Br.Sri.Bulusu Appanna Sastry on the short cuts w.r.t to द्राविड सन्ध्यावन्दनम्. However, it should be noted that this abridged one was directed towards busy goers who thought of skipping entire sandhyavandanam for lack of time. Keeping in view of the adage 'something is better than nothing', the 'laghu-sandhya' was designed.

  

  

This द्राविड सन्ध्यावन्दनम् includes:

  

1\) पुराण आचमनं

3\) प्राणायामं, देश-काल संकीर्तनं

3\) सूर्यश्च ......

4\) असाविद्यो ब्रह्म ...(only this couple of mantras chanted and rest of them skipped)

5\) अर्घ्यं

6\) गायत्री आवाहनं

7\) मुक्ताविद्रुम.....

8\) गायत्री जपं

9\) सुर्योपस्थानं

10\) गायत्री विसर्जनं

11\) अभिवादनं

12\) पुराणाचमनं

  

  

But, unfortunately, draviDa-brAhmaNAs, adopted this short-cut once for all, and didn't bother to learn the complete ritual. So, it should be borne in mind that if the option of short-cut is given, people would take that as granted and doesn't bother to learn the whole.

  

rgs,

sriram
