The mudras and shapa-vimochana for Gayatri are a Tantric recommendation and do not come from the kalpa AFAIK...please do correct if this assumption is wrong

  

Nyasa however is required atleast kara and anga nyasa. Argya is the most important component after which comes Japa and Upasthana.

  

I remember reading somewhere in the Brahmakarma Samucchaya that during the MB war the combatants chanted their upasthana mantras while fighting and offered argya with sand when they did not have access to water.

So, situation and context matters, although whether this can be taken as de rigueur when it is business as usual is a matter of individual opinion and practice.
