Prof Wakankar,  

I agree. But culture need not be totally religious in nature.

Indian culture is much more human-centric as I gradually learn.

Book or ritual are only media, it is the heart that matters.

I have come to believe that the state of yoga is India's discovery.

You can call it आस्तिकत्व. It has no time and space. It exists by itself.

Through this it is extremely liberal and creative.

I agree that people must not take advantage of the liberal view.

Through the studies in India Discovery I do see the tormented

story through the last several hundred years. Pure liberalism

would need food for all and no starvation. India was a land of

sustenance for all and hence could create art, music and literature.

The resources have to be defended (where she neglected),

but liberalism is the signature of humanity, discovered in India.

So is trending my thought..

  

I did a talk on discovery of humanity in another public lecture  

last year. Sharing
