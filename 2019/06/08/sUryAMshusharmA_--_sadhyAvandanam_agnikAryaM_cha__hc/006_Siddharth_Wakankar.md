I forgot one thing.

  

Such ritual shortcuts though created with noble thoughts and intentions, are misunderstood and become a normal procedure of practice.

  

Sometimes,even our Purohitas support this tendency to shortcuts and find dharmashastra injunctions supporting this.

  

This is called सगवडियो धर्म ( dharma of convenience) in Gujarati.

  

Good intentions misunderstood and practised.
