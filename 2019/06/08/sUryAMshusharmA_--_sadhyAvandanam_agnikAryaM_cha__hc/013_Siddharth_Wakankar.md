Dear Dr Mishra and Venkat ji,

  

My grand father, P. P.Swami Achyutaananda alias Bhagwat Swami of Uttara Kashi maths, always used to say and stress that we have lost or losing our आत्मिक बल which can be replenished only by Pooja,saadhanaa,tapascharyaa etc and unless and until we increase our balance in this account( along with bank balance),we will not be able to stand in this Kaliyuga.He advocated Kuladevataa Pooja saying that the Mother will never forsake Her progeny but will always protect it.

  

The problem with most of the people is lack of shraddha besides doubting nature due to modern westernised education which is striking at our roots but very few understand it and try to remedy.

  

I and all my real brothers and sisters and their sons and daughters till this day meticulously

follow this advice of my grand father and worship Mahalakshmi alias Ambabai of Kolhapur, where my grand father propagated Devi worship, esp.Saptashati and Lalitopaasanaa,along with other rituals and we are happy

  

There are many points to write about,but,I refrain from it as it may not serve the purpose.

  

What we can do is to worship our own God/Goddess and be aloof from what others think or do. No discussion or Shaastraartha to convince others.

  

With best wishes for our bright future and Tapasyaa.

  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
