Dear Shri Megh Kalyanasundaram

  

Thanks for your response.

  

The question is - if not actual warfare, then what exactly happened near a particular river (Parushni)? Further ahead the author also says  

"Secondly, there should be no preconceived notions (as to migrations in one direction or another, for example), so that the **text should be allowed to speak for itself, if at all it is willing to do so; and if it is not, it should be left alone**".  

I believe this is a prudent attitude which I support.

  

In general I am supportive of Sri Aurobindo's approach. But much work still needs to be done. Importantly - whether each and every mantra and sukta supports his conclusions. Sometimes he is wrong like for e.g, he diasgrees with Sayana's interpretation of गौ: as water. गौ: can indeed easily mean water based on the same idea that applies to actual Cow i.e, गच्छति इति गौ:  

This is about the release of the गा: Cows, i.e. waters, (sometimes by Indra sometimes by others) from the caves in which they are hidden etc.. But are they also symbolic? that is the question.  

  

  

But I do agree with Sri Aurobindo that there is a fundamental spiritual seeking and realization that exists in the Rgveda. It is well-known that Prof Danino is a follower of Sri Aurobindo. In the same paper Prof Danino writes  

"At the end of this exercise, we find remarkably little warfare in the \`Rgveda: probably just one battle, of which next to nothing is precisely known. If we wish to read the mind of the rishis who composed those hymns, we need to demilitarize them; in this I concur with Karen Thomson. If anything, it is the Truth (which she rightly capitalizes) that is the \`Rgveda’s obsession, not war: it seeks “the light of the Truth” (ritasya jyotis, 1.23.5), which is to be reached through the “path of the Truth” – ætasya pathå, a phrase that occurs some twenty times in the \`Rgveda (1.46.11, 1.124.3, 1.128.2, 4.35.3, 5.45.8, 5.80.4, 7.44.4, 8.22.7, 8.31.13, 9.73.6, 10.31.2, 10.66.13, 10.70.2, etc.).
