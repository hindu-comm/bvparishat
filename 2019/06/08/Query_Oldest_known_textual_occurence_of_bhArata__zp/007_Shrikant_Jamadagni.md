Dear list

  

The following paper by Prof Michel Danino provides a contrasting viewpoint. Link at the end of message.  

  

Particularly the section entitled "Warfare in the Rigveda" in which the so called Battle of Ten Kings is discussed. Here is an extract (Highlighting done by me).  

  

"....Nevertheless, in standard scholarship, the so-called “Battle of the Ten Kings” (då‹aråjña; it often escapes notice that the word “battle” is an addition in the English) is regarded as a historical event taking place near the Paru¶ƒ∂ river, that is, today’s Ravi in Punjab. In three hymns (7.18 for the main “descriptive” account, 7.33 and 7.83 for additional allusions and details), we learn that King Sudås and his Bharata followers, supported by Indra, vanquished an alliance of ten kings. Anyone expecting a workable, even partial or “poetic” Demilitarizing the °Rigveda 21 narrative of this event, on which so much historical reconstruction has been attempted, will be disappointed: instead of a narrative, a series of deliberately disjointed and obscure statements awaits us, such as Indra making the waters fordable for Sudås, or (again) splitting open seven fortified places, Sudås’s adversaries diverting the course of the Ravi river (how and to what end?), and the Yamunå river coming in out of nowhere to “help Indra” (7.18.5, 8, 13, 19). There is no attempt to even allude to an actual battle, no mention of any sort of weapon or clash of armies; horses and chariots, which we were told were part essential to the Aryans’ war machine, are absent. **In fact, one wonders whether there is any “battle” at all: the enemies are “gathered together but without a zeal to sacrifice, the ten kings gave no fight to Sudås” (7.83.7 J&B).** All that we know is that through Indra’s miraculous intervention, 6,000 members of the Anu and Druhyu clans “fell down to sleep” (7.18.14 J&B). Referring to the first of the three hymns, Jamison and Brereton note that it “has long been used as a major source for the reconstruction of \`Rgvedic history, perhaps somewhat too credulously, as the description of the battle is anything but clear and is also clearly full of puns, derisive word plays, phonological deformations of the names of opponents, and other poetic tricks, all couched in slangy language” (Jamison & Brereton 2014: 903)...."
