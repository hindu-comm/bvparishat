Dear Sir,

  

I am currently doing the level 1 course after completing which I can go to level 2.

  

The course is excellent. Every week a video lesson of half an hour duration is posted. About 26 lessons over 6 months comprise level 1 of this course. Similarly for level 2. The video quality and presentation is superb.

  

There are ways one can interact with the faculty and the rest of the participants though I have not myself tried that. There are also some reading materials at the site at various levels of difficulty which the students can access.

  

From my own progress, I get a feeling that after finishing the course I can read and understand original Sanskrit works like Ramayana, Mahabharata, Bhagavad Gita etc perhaps with some help from a good dictionary.

  

If you are interested in learning Sanskrit, please don’t hesitate. Join the course.

  

Regards,

Venkat.
