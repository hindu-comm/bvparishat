Thank you Subrahmanian mahodaya for posting the information regarding the 2-day Tutorial Workshop on Tantrayukti jointly organized by MIT School of Vedic Sciences (Pune), Kavikulaguru Kalidasa Samskrit University (Ramtek) and Indic Academy (Hyderabad) to be conducted at KKSU Ramtek on 29th and 30th June 2019. Dr. Jayaraman Mahadevan, Director Krishnamacharya Yoga Mandiram, Chennai, shall conduct the workshop. Tantaryukti is his subject of doctoral research.

  

During last October, a 4-day Tutorial workshop on Shastric Research Methodology (SRM) was successfully conducted at Ramtek. It was decided to take up each topic concerning SRM and delve deeply in a series of workshops ahead and the 2 -day tutorial workshop on Tantrayukti is the first deep dive endeavour in this direction. Clippings from the last workshop are provided herewith for a glimpse. -<https://youtu.be/YWY_wcwps3U>
