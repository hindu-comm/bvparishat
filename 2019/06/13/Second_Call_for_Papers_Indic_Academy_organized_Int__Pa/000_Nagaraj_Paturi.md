Oneness is the most sought after in the variously divided contemporary world. The thought and practice that contributed and has potential to contribute further to oneness is Advaita, the non-dualism. (The word Advaita has been variously translated into English so far. ‘Non-dualism’ among these is closer to the etymological meaning of the word. Not being two, but one is the essence of the word.) 



Adi Sankara, the fountain-head of the spread of the Advaita school of Vedanta is a great integrator. He integrated the two branches of Meemaamsaa, the discipline of Vedic hermeneutics, the Dharma ( order)-oriented or the Karma (action/ritual)-oriented branch called Poorva Meemaamsaa or Meemaamsaa in short with the Moksha(liberation)-oriented branch Uttara Meemaamsaa or Vedanta in short through his endeavor to revive and save the latter from the submerging dominance of the former.



His key philosophy of the unity of the four key concepts of Vedanta : Jeeva, the individual self, Eeswara, the all-controlling principle, Brahman, the Cosmic essence, and Jagat, the world, which is what is called as Advaita, the non-dualism, is again an integration.



His writing of commentaries to the Upanishads, Brahmasutras and the Bhagavadgita, selecting them as the three major sources of Vedanta lead to the grouping of the three as Prasthaanatraya and that grouping was followed by all the aachaaryas of different schools of Vedanta, including the aachaaryas of the schools that differed with him with regard to his fundamentals such as the unity of Jeeva Eeswara, Brahman and Jagat.



He dissolves the apparent contradiction between the paraa (spiritual) knowledge and the aparaa (the worldly) knowledge by giving each its due place in the overall scheme of the knowable, in the true faithfulness to the tradition of Upanishads. He resolves the conflict between the views towards the valid sources of knowledge by proposing the validity of the source of knowledge relative to the kind of knowledge , paraa (spiritual) or the aparaa (the worldly).



From the foundations laid by him, aachaaryas of his lineage developed the concept of levels of truth /existence in which Jagat, the world that was believed by the other schools to have been viewed as nontruth, false or illusion in Advaita was explained as not a nontruth or false but a certain level/aspect of truth, a special case of the ultimate truth, a result of application of certain parameters to the ultimate truth. Taking help of the seed ideas provided by him, , these aachaaryas showed that in the framework of Advaita, even the positions of the other schools of Vedanta negating the position of Advaita are not negated but are viewed as relatively valid positions forming special cases of the position of Advaita.





He is hagiographically credited with the integration of the six different sectarian traditions Soura (Sun-supremacist) , GaaNaapatya (Genesha-supremacist) , Kaumaara (Subrahmanya-supremacist), Shaakteya (The Shakti/Devi- supremacist), Vaishnava (Vishnu- supremacist) and Shaiva(Shiva- supremacist) into a group of six mutually inclusive traditions.



His founding of four Peethas(Dharma leadership centers) in four different corners of the vast Indic geo-cultural landscape is viewed as a project of geo-cultural unity. Sthalapuranas , the sacred place legends of a huge number of shrines of various deities including those in the remotest corners across the length and breadth of the country mention Adi Sankara as the rejuvenator of the shrine, another evidence of his role in the geo-cultural unity of the Indic landscape.



He organized various ascetic traditions and mystic practices into a coherent tradition of ascetic mystic life-style. 



Advaita or non-dualism as a school of Vedanta has been widely discussed in contemporary academic writings and gatherings. **Advaita is not just an academic topic, it is a practice followed by spiritual seekers, guided by sages**. **Indic Academy would like to highlight this by bringing all these three categories of the Advaita-practitioners involved, on to the same platform, through this international conference.**



The conference shall focus on the following broad themes: 



**1.Various strands of non-dualism /Advaita: **



Advaita, has several different strands within and outside the Sankara tradition. Outside the Sankara tradition, certain thought-practice traditions have names of Advaita with a qualifying word such as Siva Advaita, Suddha Advaita, Visishta Advaita, Sakti Visishta Advaita etc. Certain others like Sabdabrahma vaada, Pratyabhijnaa vaada which is genealogically related to the Sabdabrahma vaada itself have conceptual similitude to Advaita. Several traditional spiritual lineages such as the Naatha lineage, Dattaatreya or Avadhoota lineage have Advaita as their foundational principle. Within the Sankara tradition too there are several different sub-traditions differing in some minor details. Discussion of the relationship, connections, , similarities and differences , agreements and disagreements, continuities and discontinuities among all these , particularly in relation to Sankara Advaita belongs here.







**2.Contemporary gurus of non-dualism and their contribution**

****

Starting from Swami Vivekananda of the 19^(th) century, many gurus and leaders of the 19^(th) and 20^(th) centuries, including some who travelled abroad and influenced from there and some who stayed back in India and wielded global influence have been followers of /subscribers to Advaita, most of them hailed from the traditional guru-lineage of Advaita. Some like Sri Ramana Maharshi emerged as gurus by themselves and stood as a proof of possibility of Jeevanmukta in contemporary times. All these contemporary gurus of various strands articulated Advaita in a contemporary idiom. They created multiple contemporary flavors of Advaita. Many of them brought out contemporary applications of Advaita in Psychology and Personality Development, Social Change and Development, Political , Economic and Environmental thinking etc.This sub-theme covers these contemporary gurus, their multiple flavors and their contemporaneity, agreements and disagreements if any and continuities and discontinuities if any with a special focus on their impact on the Indian and global society. 





**3.Dasanami and other non-dualist ascetic traditions**

****

**Dashanami Sanyasi**is amonastic tradition of "single-staffrenunciation" *ēka daṇḍi sannyāsi* generally associated with theAdvaita Vedantatradition. The disciples of Adi Shankaracharya are also called "Dash Nam Sanyasi" as the title is further divided into ten groups viz. Giri, Puri, Bharati, Ban, Aranya, Sagar, Aashram, Saraswati, Tirtha, and Parwat. Dashnam Sanyasins are associated mainly with the four Maths in four corners of India, established byAdi Shankaracharya. Initially all the disciples were Sanyasins who embraced sanyas either after marriage or without getting married. According to the tradition in Kerala, after Shankara's*samadhi*at Vadakkunnathan Temple, his disciples founded four maṭhas in Thrissur, namelyNaduvil Madhom, Thekke Madhom, Idayil Madhom and Vadakke Madhom. The ēkadaṇḍis or Dasanāmis had established monasteries in India and Nepal. The tradition of Naga sadhus who are prominent atKumbh mela, who are also viewed as warrior-ascetics is believed by the Naga sadhus to have been created by Adi Shankara and is part of the Dasanami related ascetic tradition. Discussions on such ascetic traditions of Advaita fall under this sub-theme.

**4.Vibrancy of non-dualism in folk/ popular Hinduism**

****

One of the characteristic aspects of Indian culture is profound spiritual knowledge among the masses at the grassroots level and its expression in their lore in various forms such as their folk songs, metaphors, idioms and proverbs. Advaita and its key concepts such as Maayaa form part of such lore across the length and breadth of the Indic sub-continent. This makes such vocabulary part of mass dialects of various regional languages of India irrespective of whether the words are used by the spiritually enlightened or not. Yogic and other mystic spiritual traditions spread upto the remotest corners of the land , participated by people across the rank and file of the Indian society have a stupendously huge repertoire of mystic songs sung to deeply touching tunes with the spiritual practices and the oral lore of these groups deeply anchored to Advaitic ideas. These groups with their own saints and gurus hailing from their own cultural groups belonging to many variegated traditions with complex and amorphous allegiances to traditions such as Naatha, Siddha etc. show the spread of Advaitic thought and practice among the people viewed as ‘paamara’, ‘unrefined’, ‘raw’ masses. 





**5.Expression of non-dualism through Classical Music and Dance**

****

Classical arts particularly classical music and classical dance in India are known for their deep rootedness in spirituality. The lyrics sung and danced to in these traditions are composed by Vaaggeyakaaras , i.e., the poet-musicians who composed music to their poetic compositions themselves and sang them with strong classical rigor. These vaaggeyakaaras invariably were saintly persons with life-style engrossed in spiritual practice. Incidentally many of these fountain-heads of classical music and dance compositions are Advaitis. As such, the lyrics of these vaaggeyakaaras such as MuttuSwami Dikshitar, Shyama Shastri, Swati Tirunal, Tyagaraja , Munipalle Subrahmanya Kavi etc. are all Advaitic in content. Particularly Tyagaraja among these is specially interesting because of his Naadabramhopaasana strand of Advaita. Naadabrahmaadvaita is not just the content of his lyrics, it is his path for spiritual attainment. Sadasivabrahmendra is another Vaaggeyakaara, but a highly special one at that as he comes from the lineage of a Sankaracharya Peetha, is a Sankaraacharya himself and a Sanskrit vaaggeyakaara , a scholarly mystic and mystic scholar, a classical among the folk poet-singers and a folkish one among the classical poet-singers. The number of these Classical music –dance vaaggeyakaaras may run into a few hundred if we count all those who enriched the Bhajana tradition from an Advaitic background. 



**6.Itihasas and Puranas and non-dualism**



In the body of literature comprising of Itihasas such as Ramayana and Mahabharata, 18 Mahapuranas including Mahabhagavata and numerous upapuranas that has been called as panchama Veda, i.e., the fifth Veda and has been intended to be a masses-friendly version of the content of the Vedas, while there are occasions in some of these books where there is an explicit Advaitic expression, there have been a good number of commentaries of at least the major works among them clearly from an Advaitic perspective. For example, books called Rahasya Prakasa e.g. Mahabharata Rahasya Prakasa , Bhagavata Rahasya Prakasa Ramayana Rahasya Prakasa which gave esoteric interpretation to the narratives in these books, quite often gave an Advaitic interpretation to these narratives. Books like Yoga Vasishtha , Sitaramanjaneya samvaadam take the Ramayana narrative and turn them intobooks of spiritual practice with Yoga and Vedanta content. Sridhara Swmi gives an Advaita commentary to Mahabhagavata. Santa Rasa discussions of Ananda Vardhana and Abhinava gupta are non-dualist in nature. Madhusudana Saraswati argues for Bhakti as Rasa keeping Bhagavata as the central lakshya. 





--------------------------------------------------------------------



**7.Non-dualism and s'routa, aagamic, taantric and other ritual practices**

****

One of the most interesting issues sometimes made out to be contentious regarding Advaita is the participation of Advaita practitioners in rituals of S’routa and Smaarta categories, pancha maha yajnas at home, temple worship and other temple related aagamic rituals, Sri Vidyopaasana and different tantra related rituals. Sankara and his Advaita for some reason have been stereotyped to be some kind of an iconoclast tradition strictly opposed to anything other than sannyaasa in which sannyaasis are not supposed to perform pujas, are not supposed to support or participate in yajnas, are not supposed to participate in Aagamic rituals such as kumbhaabhishekams etc. Interestingly dvijas following Sankara Advaita are called Smaarta people, Smriti-followers. In many Sankara mathas Srichakra puja and other pujas are performed by the Peethaadhipati Swamis. Many Sankara Advaita practitioners are Sri Vidyopasakas and some practice different kinds of Tantra too. Discussion on the justifiability of such combinations forms part of this sub-theme.



**8.Non-dualism in Yoga and other inner-world practices**



There are books explaining close connection between Hatha Yoga practice and Advaita. A very good example of a typical Advaitic kriyaa is Soham kriyaa or Ajapaa japa or Ajapaa Yoga. This breathing Yoga practice getting popularized again during modern times. Many other such secret Yoga practices as Taaraka Raja Yoga which are essentially Advaitic are gaining currency among spiritualpractitioners today.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------



**9.Science and Non-dualism**

****

With greater and greater advancements in science, there are newer and newer proposals that scientific understanding is taking human knowledge closer and closer towards oneness of everything. Boundaries between aspects of reality or gradually collapsing each aspect being proved to be another form of the other. Boundaries between matter and energy, space and time, wave and particle, life and non-life all pairs are being viewed as continua. Work towards a unified field is progressing. Consciousness studies and the natural sciences are merging into each other. Thiese developments are encouraging people to take up Science based studies of Non-dualism.



**10.Lesser known works on Advaita**

****

The conference as one of its themes focuses on bringing into light many works on Advaita that did not get due attention or those that are mentioned in the well known works but have not been traced yet.
