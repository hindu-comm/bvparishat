Dear Shri Anand,

  

I am very happy that you have started publishing this very important unpublished text.

  

I would request your good self and the authorities there to kindly arrange to send a copy of this text,because,I have been instrumental in procuring copies of two rare Manuscripts from Rajasthan Oriental Research Institute, Alwar Branch, Rajasthan and two other copies of this text from Fergusson College,Pune.

  

Hope,you will mention this fact in your introduction when you give details of the manuscripts.

  

Best luck to you in this very ambitious intellectual activity.  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
