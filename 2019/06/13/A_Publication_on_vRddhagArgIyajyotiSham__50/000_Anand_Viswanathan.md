Respected Scholars,

  

Research on Pre-siddhantic Astronomy is of prime interest at the**Center for Ancient History and Culture, Bengaluru**. Among other initiatives, critical study of manuscripts of Vrddhagaargiya Jyotisha (VGJ) has been in progress for the last two years. While bringing out a complete edition of VGJ remains a distant goal, short of this, we like to share a recent paper on the text consisting of brief introduction and working level text of the first 3 chapters of VGJ with variant readings based on eight manuscripts. This work has been published in**Tattvadipa**, the Journal of Academy of Sanskrit , Melukote. We hope this will be of interest to some members here.
