नमस्ते,  

  

I've heard this story (द्रश्टान्त) of Indra cursed to become Pig. The story demonstrates the power of Maya, that even the king of Swarga gets so much engrossed in maya that he did not want to return to Swarga loka. I am trying to find out it's root, is there any mentioning of it into the scriptures or just a good man made story?  

  

All I can find out is that there is a reference of it into the commentary written by Swami Vivekananda for Patanjali Yoga Sutra verse 18 of chapter 2. Beyond it, I could not find any reference to it. Could anybody help me to point to the origin of this story, if it does exists?  

  

धन्योष्मि,  

सुनिल
