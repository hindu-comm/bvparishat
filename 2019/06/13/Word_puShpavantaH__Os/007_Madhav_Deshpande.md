This reminds me of some other अकारान्त usages that originate as present participles or as matvanta. For example, the word जयन्त looks like an अकारान्त version of the present participle, while the word भगवन्त at least in the name of the work भगवन्तभास्कर looks like an अकारान्त version of भगवत्. Are there other अकारान्त usages like this elsewhere in Sanskrit. I have a suspicion thatsome of these have re-entered Sanskrit from Prakrit usages. Grammatical Sanskrit forms like जयन्तौ जयन्तम् भगवन्तौ भगवन्तम् etc. were probably reanalyzed in certain Prakrits as forms of अकारान्त stems. However, in languages like Pali, forms like भगवा, भगवन्तं, भगवता, भगवतो, भगवते etc. do continue.
However, the nominative singular form in Pali is गच्छन्तो as compared to Sanskrit गच्छन्. This is probably the indication where the reanalysis of such stems as अकारान्त may have begun.
