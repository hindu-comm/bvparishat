Dear all

I am looking for a word

पुष्पवन्तः (not नान्त)from Kosas I searched Vaijayanti and Visvaprakasa but could not find there. If you find this word in any Kosas kindly inform.

I found this word in the Commentary of Amarakosa that is Sudha on the verse पुष्पवन्तौ and seen usage in VisvaguNadarsa Champu

  

Yours sincerely

KP
