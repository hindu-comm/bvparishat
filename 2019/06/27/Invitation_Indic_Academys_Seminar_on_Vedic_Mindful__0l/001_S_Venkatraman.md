Namaste Paturiji,  
  
The subjects addressed by the workshop are extremely interesting. Unfortunately the workshop has already got over yesterday. Are you aware if the recordings of the workshop are going to be made available? Or is there a plan to publish the deliberations in book form?  
  
Many thanks and regards,  
Venkat
