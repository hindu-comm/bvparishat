Respected scholars,



For information, please find attached the announcement for the 3^(rd) edition of our course on Indian Knowledge Systems, a full-semester HSS elective that will run at IIT Gandhinagar from next week onward.



As this course is open to students / faculty / scholars outside IITGn, I will be thankful if you kindly forward the announcement and poster to contacts in Ahmedabad-Gandhinagar who may be interested.



With warm regards and best wishes for the New Year,



Michel
