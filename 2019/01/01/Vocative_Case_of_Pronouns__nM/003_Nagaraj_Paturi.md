The point that comes out through the thread is that bhavat -s'abda forms are in fact third person forms only that are used as though they are second person forms.

  

---------------------------------

  

Though first person vocative forms are not found , there is a third person form to the first person pronoun aham. That is 'aatman'. Aatman can theoretically have vocative form.

  

Sadasiva Bramhendra uses " maanasa! " " rasane! " as self-referring vocative forms.

  

Maanasa! sanchara re, BramhaNi.

  

bruhi mukundeti rasane!
