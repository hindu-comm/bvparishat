Thanks, Nagaraj. Bhavat sabda is used in several places to address a person. 2 such instances are given below. It does not seem to be a modern usage.

  

भवान्भीष्मश्च कर्णश्च कृपश्च समितिञ्जयः Mahabharata

भवतो दर्शनं यत्स्यादपुनर्भवदर्शनम् Srimad Bhagavata

  

Too bad that the rest of that interesting discussion was not even close about vocative case.
