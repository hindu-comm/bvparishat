Namaste,

  

Kale never shows a vocative case for a pronoun. Bucknell shows vocative case for the sarva paradigm, and mentions its applicability for several other pronouns.

Issue raised at<https://github.com/sanskrit-lexicon/MWinflect/issues/40> - have you ever met such cases or know where they are described in grammar, maybe with examples?
