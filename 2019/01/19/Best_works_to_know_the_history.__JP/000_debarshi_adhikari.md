Namaste Gurubaryah.

I am fond of Sanskrit Language. I attended various camps conducted by Sanskrit Bharati to learn the basics. Now I am studying the language. I want to know more about it by studying history of modern sanskrit literature and history of Alamkara-shastras. Please recommend me the best books in simple Sanskrit language so that I can learn more about the language.

Thank you-
