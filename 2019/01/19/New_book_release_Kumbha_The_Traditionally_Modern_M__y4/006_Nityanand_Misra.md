Dr. Yogananda Ji

  

Glad to know you felt that the book brings the Kumbha Mela alive. It was my goal to make the reader experience the Kumbha in some way when they are reading the book. The photos on the cover and the sixteen colour plates have helped achieve this to an extent.

Thanks for your kind comments.

  

Arjun Kashyap Ji,

  

The Hindi subtitle is not, and should not be seen as, a translation of the English subtitle. As in many places in the Hindi edition also, I have not made a literal or direct translation of English expressions and sentences but favoured more natural, forceful, and poetic expressions and sentences in Hindi. The Hindi subtitleपुरातन और नूतन का मेला can be understood as“a mela of the old and the new” or “where the old and the new meet”. The का has the same sense as in गङ्गा और यमुना का संगम, i.e. it is to be read with both पुरातन and नूतन. The book has already been printed, so too late to have any suggestions now :). My second choice was कुम्भ: चिर पुरातन नित नूतन but the publishers felt that the word मेला has to come in the subtitle so we went with the first choice only.

  

Thanks, Nityananda
