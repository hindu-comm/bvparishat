Dear Mishra ji Namaste,

Hearty congratulations for your new book, eagerly waiting for the Amazon delivery.

Sir,

**Kumbha:The Traditionally Modern Mela**

The title itself sounds very appealing, while in Hindi translation of the same I felt something is missing. (May be the appeal and approach).

  

**‘कुम्भ: पुरातन और नूतन का मेला’  
**

What meaning does the 'का' gives in this context. Being a South-Indian Hindi reader, I felt there can be a minor modification in the Hindi title.

  

  

suggestions:

**कुंभ****:** **एक** **नवीन** **पारंपरिक** **मेला******

**कुंभ****:** **नूतन** **पारंपरिक** **मेला******

**कुंभ****:** **परंपरागत** **आधुनिक** **मेला******

**कुंभ****:** **प्रथानुकूल** **एक** **आधुनिक** **मेला******

**कुंभ****:** **नव** **युग** **की** **एक** **पारंपरिक** **मेला**

**etc.**

  

I deeplyapologise if you feel I interfered unnecessarily.
