Dear Friends,

I am giving below a link to the lectures given in Chicago on Dec 15 2018. This was a

five hour workshop. I have made an attempt to expound upon the values of varna ashram

dharma as given in the ancient texts, and which has been maligned as a system of oppression

by the modern West and its imitators in India. I tried to show that Varna Ashram created a

prosperous India, an artistically and sexually happy place to live in and to pursue spirituality

after material satiation.*My views contradict the general line followed by nearly all great*

*THINKERS since the late 18th century that Indian culture is primarily spiritual.*Instead I have pointed

to the life of four purusharthas and balance it idealized. The disturbance in the balance has

always created unhappiness and cultural-political downfall such as in the present.

I AM HOPING THAT THESE TALKS SHALL PUT THE ANCIENT IDEALS OF LIFE IN A  
A FAVORABLE LIGHT AND OUR YOUNG SHALL BE ABLE TO SEE HOW EXACTLY THERE IS

MUCH TO RECREATE IN MODERN INDIA IF ONE GETS OVER THE PERNICIOUS  
PROPAGANDA THAT WE ARE FED UPON.

ALSO I HOPE THESE TALKS SHALL LEAD MANY TO DEEPLY STUDY THE TEXTS WITH AN OPEN MIND.

  
The recording of the Chicago workshop is made available by the great kindness of a rare  
scholar Sunthar Visuvalingam who was present to contribute and record.

  
I had given similar 5hr workshops on this December tour in HOUSTON, DALLAS,  
SAN HOSE, HOUSTON AGAIN, and WASHINGTON DC also. I do not have any

recordings of it, though some people did a lot of footage. Kindly get in touch  
with me to provide me the footage if possible. I shall be thankful and put it on the

my Youtube channel and on the INDIC ACADEMY website.
