Dear scholars,

  

I am looking for the following article by H. D. Sankalia published in 1965. Deccan College Library has all previous issues of *JUPHS* except number 13, part 1. I will greatly appreciate if someone can help with a pdf or scanned copy of it.

  

Aryans in the Gangetic valley. *Journal of the Uttar Pradesh Historical Society* 13 (1) = C. D. Chatterjee (ed.), *Itihāsa-Chayanikā,* *Dr. Sampurnanand Felicitation Volume*, pp. 41–44. Lucknow: UP Historical Society.

Best,

Hemant
