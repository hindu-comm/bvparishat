I refer to the Sanskrit text provided by Shankaraji. I have had a quick glance at the work produced by Sri. H R R Iyengar. I am like in many other fields an ignoramus in this area of Indian logic. Still, I cannot but express my amazement at the amount of work put in by Sri. H R R Iyengar to produce this work. I would like to know more about Sri Iyengar. I am sure there would definitely be scholars in BVP who know more about him.

Regards,

Murthy
