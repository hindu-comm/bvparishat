Dear Prof. Pandurangi,

  

H. R. Rangaswamy Iyengar's book titled: Pramana Samuccaya, Edited and Restored into Sanskrit with Vritti, Tika and Notes \[Pratyaksaparicchedah\], was published by Government Branch Press, Mysore, 1930. This is the first chapter only of the Pramana-samuccaya. If you cannot access this book, I can make a scan of my photocopy of it.

  

Best regards,

  

David Reigle

Colorado, U.S.A.
