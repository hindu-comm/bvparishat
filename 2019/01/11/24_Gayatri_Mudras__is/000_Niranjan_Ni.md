Dear Vidvans,

  

What is the shastric source for the 24 mudras recommended before Gayatri Japa?

  

The 24 mudras seem mostly mentioned in certain sandhayvandana books but not in Apastambha/Bodhayana grihyasutras as far as I have checked. Do correct me if I am wrong on this.

  

Also is there an authentic source on how these mudras are performed? What mantras are chanted while showing the mudras etc?

  

Thanks,

  

  

Niranjan
