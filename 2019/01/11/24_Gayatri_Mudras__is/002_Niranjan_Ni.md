Dear Shri Paturi Garu,

  

Thanks for the links.

They however do not seem to contain information beyond the names of the mudras and while the video by the gentleman explaining the mudras was nice, I was looking for information from people rooted in tradition.

  

In both Tantra and Yoga there is a lot of confusion created by new organisations and individuals creating their USP to give them more traction in the spiritual "market". I am hence a bit wary of learning from sources that are not rooted in shastra and tradition.

There is another video here--><https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19iGsGXYsOs>

  

Wrt the views of Sriram ji while I do respect the views of the Vedic scholar, it is still one point of view only about a subject matter that is 90% hidden / lost now.

  

I am really not trying to sound imperious or dismissive here but please listen to an experience of mine-->

Let me clarify this with a story-

  

For 20 years, I have roamed around looking for authentic Yogis / tantrics/ Vedics and such practitioners.

One of the genuine people I met was this gentleman who was able to invoke the agneyastra which happens to be a proper Vedic mantra. This man was of the opinion that adhyayana is totally different from prayoga.

QUOTE

Nyasas and mudras are very much a part of the prayoga limb of the veda, which has to be learnt from the mouth of the Guru. It is common nowadays to label any anga that involves nyasa and mudra as tantric in origin, but this is not the case. Many prayogas were exclusively passed on orally and were rarely if ever recorded in order to prevent the very real possibility of misuse.

UNQUOTE

  

The man left without a forwarding address after political types started getting interested in him.
