Subject: \[INDOLOGY\] New font design from Vani Vilas, feedback request  
To: Indology \<[indo...@list.indology.info]()\>  

  
  

Dear all  

I outsourced Vanivilas fonts for designing.

  

I observed 3 weights. Normal Bold and Heavy Bold

here I am sending a pdf of Bold(yet to decide with weights) fonts, which are mainly used in all the texts published earlier, the regular or normal fonts were used only for commentaries or footnotes. And the heavy bold for Title, headings etc.

Please suggest corrections.

  

Regards

Krishna Prasad
