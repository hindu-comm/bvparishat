Pattajoshiji,

  

In case you haven't already seen it, Yudhishtira Mimamsaka describes Rangoji Bhatta as the younger brother of Bhattoji Dikshita, in 'Sanskrit Vyakaran Sastra Ka Itihas' vol 1, page 486. He also provides a family tree of Bhattoji Dikshita.

Baldev Upadhyaya also considers Rangoji Bhatta as the younger brother of Bhattoji Dikshita, in his 'Kasi Ki Panditya Parampara', page 63.
