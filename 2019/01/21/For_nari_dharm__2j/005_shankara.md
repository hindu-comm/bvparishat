Namaste,

  

This view regarding child marriage in ancient India is not accepted by all scholars. A.S. Altekar in his book 'Education in Ancient India' page 207 (chapter on female education), says that there were two classes of girl students - sadyovadhu who got married at the age of 16 or 17 and brahmavadinis who married after completion of education *(may be at the age of 25).*
