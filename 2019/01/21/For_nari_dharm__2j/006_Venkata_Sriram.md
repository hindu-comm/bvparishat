Namaste,

  

Kavyakanta Ganapati Muni didn't approve the kanyA-vivAha ie., marriage before puberty. It seems he referred the Rg vedic texts and decided the 'right age' for girls is 16.

  

Orthodox muThaadhipatis like paramacharya had different opinions and they opine for 8 ....

  

One of our close associates who happens to be a professor of clinical psychology and retd. vice chancellor of a reputed neuro-science institute, is of the opinion that it is always a good practice to marry off the girl once she attains puberty which is good for her health both physically and mentally. Later on, after marriage, she can continue her studies which should not be a problem. Both husband & wife should concentrate on studies and career post-marriage.

  

The result of today's sexual perversions is quite obvious for not following the prescribed customs !

  

rgs,

sriram
