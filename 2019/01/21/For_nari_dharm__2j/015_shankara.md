Sriramji,

  

Thanks. I will read the Vivahadharmasutra.

Do you know whether any of the disciples of Ganapati Muni or scholars in his lineage wrote commentaries on Ganapati Muni's sutra works such as Vivahadharmasutra? Without commentaries it would not be possible for us to understand their real import.  

  

regards  
shankara
