पुण्याहमद्य संजातमहं त्वद्दर्शनोत्सुकः ।  
कन्या मदीया राजेन्द्र ह्यष्टवर्षा व्यजायत ॥ १४२.१८ ॥  
चतुर्भुजाय दातव्या वागुवाचाशरीरिणी ।  
भीष्मकस्य वचः श्रुत्वा दमघोषोऽब्रवीदिदम् ॥ १४२.१९ ॥  
  
This is BheeSHmak giving his 8 year old Daughter Rukmink to Chediraj Shishupala, son of DamaghoSHa..  
  
I had stumbled upon a blog of some vitandavadi, he had shown screenshots of mistranslated versions of Puranas, the prasanga is RukminivivAha.  
  
Bhagwat Purana was mistranslated as not yet entered puberty, for "vyanjatstaneem" where Vyanjana means sign and stanee means one who's breasts show signs of puberty.  
  
Then in Brahmavaivarta, they mistranslated again. अप्रौढां च नवोढां तां नवसंगमलज्जिताम् ।  
Apraudha means immature, translated to not fully developed. And Navodha means newly wed. translated to "just entered puberty."  
  
Nava= new. Sangama=union Lajjita=shy/hesitant.  
Lajjita translated as abashed!  
She was abashed at the idea of sexual intercourse!  
  
Any new bride will be shy if it's her first time! In fact even males are shy.  
Also, union translated as sex! Such laukik buddhi in Gods divine sport is not shlaaghya.  
  
But in Skanda Purana, this shloka is also given. So it maybe interpolated or we can assume that child marriage was common back then?  
Also, Krishna's life is not to be anukaraniya! I mean you can't eat mud \[unless you want to lie in hospital ;-) \], and can't drink poison or steal clothes of women! Every Leela has a divine reason, so is this.  
  
JaiShiRama.  
JaiShriKrishna.
