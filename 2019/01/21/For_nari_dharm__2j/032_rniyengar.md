Referring to such books as " ...law books..."is IMHO wrong as far as Hindu 'dhaarmic' perception of worldview is concerned. Even during the period of the composition of such smr.tis, it is doubtful whether these so called laws were enforced, as Dan.d.a-niiti. If I am wrong, I would like to be corrected, but with verifiable evidences in terms of inscriptions and royal edicts. Existence of many smr.tis is evidence for regional and temporal variations, adjustments and changes, still maintaining 'dharma', which approximates 'righteousness'. Many Vedic-Hindu concepts such as 'dharma' can not be expressed correctly in English. I wish translators avoid imaginary equivalents that would surely mislead many Indians who read only English translations of their ancient literature.
