Namaste

  

I think the question was about particularly Stri Dharma for unmarried women. In ancient times the women were married very early like 8 years and even earlier. Therefore there may not be much literature on Dharma for the small girl children. For boys before Upanayana there is not much Dharma. They can behave as they want Yathecchayaa playing and in pleasure. Similarly small girls under father's protection can behave as they want.
