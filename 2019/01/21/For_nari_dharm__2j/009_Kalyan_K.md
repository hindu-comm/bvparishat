//Girls should follow the 'rajaswala-niyama'...//  
  
A famous Telugu pravachana karta "implied" in one of his speeches that -  
  
1. Woman can chant Vishnu sahasranama even when she is rajaswala. He gave the example of Draupadi praying Krishna for help in the Hastinapura sabha.  
  
2. Vishnu sahasranama can be chanted even without taking bath. Suchi is not required for chanting VSN.  
  
According to him, above does not apply to other sahasranamas.
