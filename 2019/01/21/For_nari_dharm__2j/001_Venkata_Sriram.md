Namaste,

  

Instead of going too deep into dharma-shastra, I would recommend to study sanskrit, amarakosha and other kavyas. Learning of classical music as per one's regional affinity (carnatic / hindustani) brings closer to culture.

  

If interested to take mantra, one should take gauri panchakshari mantra. The vratas like 'katyAyani-vrata' etc. can be undertaken.
Reading good books authored by great women of spiritual bent like Sister Nivedita, Annie Besant, Mother of Pondicherry, biography of Holy Mother Sharada (divine consort of Thakur Ramakrishna Paramahamsa) are inspiring to for girls.

  

These are enough in current circumstances...  
  
rgs,

sriram
