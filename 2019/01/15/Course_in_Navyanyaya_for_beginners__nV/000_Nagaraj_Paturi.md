Prof. V N Jha who is on a mission to spread s'aastric knowledge among modern learners , wrote to me:

  

Dear Prof. Paturi,

  

  

I am going to offer a Four level graded course in Navyanyaya for the beginners. Information attached. Kindly circulate and advise the interested learners. Engineers working in the area of language technology, AI, machine translation, etc. can also derive insights from this programme. Language philosophers can also join.
