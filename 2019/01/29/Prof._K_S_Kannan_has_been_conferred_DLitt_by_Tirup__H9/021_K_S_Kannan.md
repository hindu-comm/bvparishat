I express my heartfelt thanks to all who have blessed me/wished me well

in the wake of the conferring of D.Litt. upon me by  

RSVP (Rashtriya Sanskrit Vidyapeetha), Tirupati.  

  

Many have conveyed their feelings on the BVP platform,

and many more personally. I thank all once again.

  

Regards

KSKannan
