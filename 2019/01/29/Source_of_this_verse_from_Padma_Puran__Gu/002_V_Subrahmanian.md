Dear Shankara ji,

  

Is the Purana pages available in the above link complete? I ask this because I could not get results for some searches I made in some Purana pages. For instance, I looked for श्रवणं कीर्तनं विष्णोः ..in Bhagavatam page and did not get any result. This verse is there in the Prahlada charitam skandha. Similar was the case with searches for well known verses in other Puranas. Could you please clarify?

  

Thanks andregards

subbu
