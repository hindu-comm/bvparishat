Damodara Das ji,

  

This verse is not found in the encoded text of Padma Purana available at  

<http://peterffreund.com/Vedic_Literature/Vedic%20Literature%20Unicode/Purana/>

though this topic is discussed in Padmottarakhanda. Sometimes, this verse may be there in Eastern recension of Padma Purana.  

  

The same verse with minor variations is found in Vriddha Harita Smriti. No source is mentioned.

  

शङ्खचक्रोर्ध्वपुण्ड्रादिधारणं दास्यलक्षणम्।  
तन्नामकरणञ्चैव वैष्णवन्तदिहोच्यते ॥वृद्धहारितस्मृतिः १.२४॥

regards  
shankara
