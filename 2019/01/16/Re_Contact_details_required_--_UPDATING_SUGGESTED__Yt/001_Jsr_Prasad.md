Respected Sir,

  

Sad to know this. Was there a formal communication to this effect?

  

Though you need not know, we, here, can construct the possible cause. As much as I see, we hear this news after your participation in the 'Churning of Indology' conference. In addition, I think, almost all videos are made available on line. This is no less than a political repression by people with vested interests, for apparent reasons.

  

Indeed, your University should feel proud and felicitate you for the award conferred on you - 'प्राच्यप्रतीच्यविद्यावाचस्पतिः' by BVP at Udupi, recently.

  

May you continue to inspire all of us with your wisdom and scholarship. We stand by you. Hope, my colleagues would agree.

  

Warm regards,

Prasad
