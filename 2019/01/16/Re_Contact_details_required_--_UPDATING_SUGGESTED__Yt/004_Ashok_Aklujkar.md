Dear Dr. Prasad,  
  
I was referring to the exchange of emails between Dr. Shashi Prasad and Dr.Ranjit Behara. They were obviously concerned with some ‘contact details”, and I saw no "vested interests” in or behind that concern, Why they wanted some contact details was not clear to me. Nor was it a deep concern of mine to find out why their exchange appeared as a bvp post. I did not see them as repressing or as acting "poitical”.  
  
Best wishes.  
  
a.a.
