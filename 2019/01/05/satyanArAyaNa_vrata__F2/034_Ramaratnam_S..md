Respected Sri Iyengar,

  

I thank you for the information. Sri. Dikshita has composed about 500 krtis out of which only three are in manipravala style. The rest are all in Sanskrit, that is about 99.5%. Therefore, the sentence  

'His compositions are in Sanskrit and MaNipravALam.'may be modified as 'His compositions are mainly in Sanskrit (two or three are in manipravala style).' This is only a suggestion.

with regards,

ramaratnam
