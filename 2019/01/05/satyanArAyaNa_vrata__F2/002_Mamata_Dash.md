With regards to all vidvaans, if the origin of Satyanarayana puja us Satya piira, then how the word satya will be justified. There is a special temple inside the jagannath temple of Puri named satyanarayana temple. The icon is of black granite stone.

And I have edited a book named Satyanarayana puja but in Odia.

I thinkSatyanarayana puja was very much there in India, but to create an impression, the procedure was followed suitable to Muslim style.

With regards
