Thanks for the extract Shankara-ji. It seems that the offering of shirni (I don’t know what this dish is) seems to be the main point here. Perhaps that dish culturally Muslim. But Prof. Paturi’s questions need to be addressed, especially the word satya in satyapir for influence one way or the other.

  

As a side note, the first time I heard about the Satyanarayana pUjA was in North America. I had never seen this in Tamil Nadu in my younger days, although from a fairly orthoprax background. I later found that it is quite popular among Telugu and Kannnada smArta-s, but not with Tamils.
