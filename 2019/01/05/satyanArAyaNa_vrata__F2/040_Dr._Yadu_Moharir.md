Namaste Sreekarsaha:

  

I have no clue whether this is practiced by other follower of Islam.

  

We somehow think that things in our culture are "FIXED", which is not really true. Even for any language including Sanskrit grammar things are always susceptible for modifications with the passage of time. Panini refers to vertebral grammarians before him and recommends applying them as needed.

  

In science, this is known as the "Information Theory". It is only on the basis of this theory Bell Labs developed MP3 Format and Transmission over Cable by preserving the critical points of information. Theory state, "Information that is certain in the beginning tends to become uncertain with the passage of time".

  

In thermodynamics this is the essential principle concept on Entropy.

Dear Dr. Yadu,

  

Do you have any idea of the vrata kathA of satya pir and its procedure? The only tale about satya pir I am seeing here is a link posted which instead of looking like any syncreticism to me is more of an idea of actively downgrading nArAyaNa instead. <https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.12589/page/n111>
