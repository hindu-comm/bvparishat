I am neither a musician nor a musicologist. I collect information of cultural interest from sources that appear *reasonably reliable*. The following is my source.

Extracts from [www.nadasurabhi.org](http://www.nadasurabhi.org)

  

".... The most popular Manipravalam composition of Dikshitar is ‘Sri Abhayamba ninnu’ in ‘Sri’ Ragam set to Adi Talam. It is the last kriti (9th) the Mangala kriti in the ‘Abhayamaba Vibhakti Kritis’ group. Here Dikshitar employs three languages, Sanskrit, Telugu and Tamil. The other 2 Manipravala kritis are ‘Sri Venkata Chalapathe (Adi), and ‘Sri Maharajni’, both in ‘Karnataka Kapi’ Ragam."

Thanks for the question.
