Satyanarayanavrata and puja is very popular in Maharashtra as well as in Gujarat and all those places where these communities migrated like M.P.,U.P.,Bihar,Bengal and even in Southern parts of India.The puja is performed by people from all strata of society.

  

There is one big Satyanarayana Mandir in the Free Gunj area of Ujjain also.

  

It is just possible that these migrated people carried their culture to distant places like Assam,Bengal etc.because,I found that there are some Marathi.looking words in Assamese,Bengali,Bihari etc.

  

One striking similarity which I experienced in December,1986.

  

In the western part of Howrah station area near the Homeopathy College,I saw a dispensary of an opthalmologist named Dr.Modak,a typical Maharashtrian surname.I met that gentleman and he emphatically said that he is a pakka Bengali,though originally they are/ were from Maharashtra,but,for many generations,they are in Bengal,so,are now full.fledged Bengalis.

  

I think,this sufficiently proves the cultural migration.
