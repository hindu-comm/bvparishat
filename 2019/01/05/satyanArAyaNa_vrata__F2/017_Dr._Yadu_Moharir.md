Namsate:

  

I have checked with my Muslim Friend from Bangladesh. He confirms that Satya-Peer is a traditional worship in Bangladesh.

  

What has always puzzled me is that SatyanarayaNa vrata is not found in Bombay Edition of Skandha puuraaNa but is there in the Calcutta edition of Skandha puraaNa.

  

This observation was noted is P.V. Kane's book History of dharma shaastra.

  

May be scholars from Bengal will be able to enlighten us on this observation.

  

Thx

  

Rgds  

  

Dr Yadu

Does anyone know Sirni in general and/or Sirni as a Bengali Moslem dish?

  

Does anyone anything about any Satyapir from any part of Bengal?
