Sri BVK ji has summed up the arguments in a good perspective. The word 'satyam' as told in the Upanishads is loosely translated as truth, whereas Sri Shankara's commentaries on ' satyam, jnanam anantam Brahma' and in other places explain the word to mean the foundational existence which forms the substratum for various phenomenon on the one Reality and which is not negatable at any time, i.e, past, present and future, trikaalaabaadhyam. The word satyam is perhaps taken by later religions, for which we need not bother much. Certainly Satya pir is not older than the Taittiriya Upanishad. Even the Sikhs have taken the words 'sat' and 'akaal' which almost mean the same.
