Let me reiterate:

  

All the details of the performance /execution of the Satyanarayana vrata are Hindu specific. None of the details prompt an investigation into any non-Hindu influence.

  

As a name of a Pier the word Satya does not match. That prompts an enquiry into non-Moslem influence

  

Please ask your Bangladeshi friend

  

Is Satya peer worshipped as part of Moharram rituals?

  

If yes, is Satya the name of a local Moslem paigambar whose ruh is bel8evec to return during Moharram and is placed alongside the panja s of Hasan, Hussain and Bibi Fatima?

  

Mohaarram peers are worshipped in by placing the panja in an Ashurkhana not inside any household.

  

If not, is it the name of a local paigambar who is worshipped in a Dargah?

  

If yes, is the paigambar's peer worshipped only in a Dargah or in a household?

  

Is Satya a Moslem name or a Hindu name?

  

If a Moslem name, is it a usual practice in that part of the world for Moslems to have vowel ending Sanskrit or Sankrit like names?

  

Is Satya the name of a Hindu saint worshipped by Hindus and Moslems in the form of his ruh /spirit ?

  

Is Satya the name of a Hindu saint worshipped originally only by Moslems and later under Moslem influence by Hindus?

  

There is a dish called phirni.

  

Is the dish offered to Satya peer phirni or Sirni?

  

Is shodashopacharapuja very important part of Satya peer worship?

  

Is the narration of the story of vratakatha a compulsory element of Satya peer worship?

  

If yes, does that story contain the aspects of all four varna's being eligible to perform etc?

  

  

..........................

  

  

What made Hindus borrow Satya peer worship? Fear of Satya peer? If yes, is this element of fear of consequences of not worshipping , part of Satya peer cult?

  

Was it because the Hindus liked Sirni , a new dish unknown to them before the Satya peer cult?

  

Is Sirni being offered not part of any Hindu ritual?

  

Which part of the vrata is not part of Hindu vratas and hence leads to the suspicion of a Moslem influence?
