//Taking this into account along with Ramakrishnan's observation & commen does it not suggests that this "SatyanaaraayaNa ritual / vratakathaa" seems to have migrated slowly to Eastern and Southern regions on India.//  
  
  
From the information on the internet, Satyanarayana vrata is done in western parts like Maharashtra and Gujarat too. People from these regions may let us know if this is correct.  
  
There is a famous Satyanarayana swamy temple at Annavaram in Andhra Pradesh. A search on the net shows Satyanarayana temples in Tamil Nadu and Odisha also. On youtube, I found Satyanarayana puja and katha in Tamil. The vrata is done not only by brahmins but by other castes too in Karnataka.  
  
Is there any evidence to show that this vrata originated in Bengal and then spread to the other parts of India?
