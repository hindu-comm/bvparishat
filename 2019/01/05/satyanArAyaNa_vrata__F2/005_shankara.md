Paturiji,

  

In fact, some leading Indologists have suggested such a possibility.  

  

1\. The idea that Satyanarayana Vrata Katha (SNVK) has Muslim origin was first suggested by Hara Prasad Sastri in 1928 in his preface to 'Descriptive Catalogue of Sanskrit Manuscripts at Asiatic Society, Calcutta'Vol 5, page 65 (extract attached to this mail).

  

2\. This is also mentioned by PV Kane in vol 5 part 1 of History of Dharmasastra, page 437. Kane quotes from an article by Hara Prasad Shastri published in JBORS (Joural of Bihar and Orissa Research Society vol 15, page 328), 'the Mahomedan custom of offering 'Sirni' to Satyapir was adopted by Bengal Hindus as worship of Satyanarayana.'. Extract from Kane's book is attached to this mail. Though JBORS vol 15 is available online at <https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.280418> I could not find Hara Prasad Sastri's article on SNVK in it. If anyone finds this article, please share it with all.

  

(Based Wakankarji's post I gues 'Sirni' must be 'Siiraa' offered to the deity during the Puja. I request Wakankarji to provide the title of PK Gode's article on SNVK.)  

  

3\. SG Kantawala in an article titled 'Satyanarayana Vratakatha and Upabrimhana' published in the proceedings of World Sanskrit Conference concludes that SNVK is a Puranic Upabrmhana of the Vedic concept of Satya and other concepts associated with the Vedic Vishnu, Varuna and Indra..... (Article attached to this mail).  

  

I requeste scholars of BVP to point out any critical study on the probability of Islamic influence on SNVK or Hindu influence on Satyapirer Katha.

shankara
