Namaste

  

There seems to be a several mix up strands and thoughts in this thread of discussions, especially an overflow of ' cultural sensitivity at one end and insensitive academic argument on the other end, which seems to miss the social flow and dynamics of religion -ritual in community; especially in India. Here below are my arguments and line of thinking:

  

***Given Facts***:

a\) Current model of Satyanarayana Pooja is a global Hindu celebration in which ' Glory of Truth, God's intervention and punishment for violation of a Promise failed' is the conclusion as ' Katha narrative '. Of course, the same story is also the ' authentic origin' of the
expression' ' Dardira Brahmana' (= Poor Brahmin) for over two centuries now. Astatement oft repeated to make the equation 'Brahmin must be poor ifone is a real brahmin' !

b ) The observance, irrespective of its socio-cultural originis observed as a 'Hindu Observance' and NOT as a ' ISLAMIC observance'.The glory of Truth, the name of ' Allah as Truth' does not drive theIslamic community to adapt the 'Vrata observance format of Satyanarayanapooja'.

  

**Note: Google up ' IslamTruth, Truth holy Quran' . These statements would be found in abundance:**

‘Truth’ is a name of Allah. Truth or Haqq is a name of God in the Quran:  
“Supremely exalted then is Allah, the King, the Truth.”—20 :114  
“That is because Allah, He is the Truth,” —22 :6  
“Allah, He is the Evident Truth.”— 24: 25  
Hence Abdul Haqq is a name of men among Muslims which means the servant of Truth, by Truth being meant Allah.  
God is truthful  
Truth being a name of Allah, the Quran says that God is the most truthful:  
“Allah speaks the truth”—3 :95; “And Allah speaks the truth and He shows the way.” — 33: 4  
“He (Allah) said: The Truth is, and the truth I speak…” — 38: 84  
The following statement is repeated more than ten times in the Quran:  
“…surely Allah’s promise is true”— 10:55; It also says:“It is Allah’s promise, in truth. And who is more truthful in word than Allah?” —4 :122  
God created the world with truth. It is stated some ten times in the Quran that Allah created the heavens and the earth with truth:

c\) Vrata format of worshipping Devatas is older than islams entry to India ! and recognition of TRUTH (Satya) as Supreme is Vedic. (Satyam Jnanam Anantham Brahma; Satyam param dheemahi ; Satyam is one of the lokas mentioned as a part of Gayatri Samkalpa).  

  

***Argument*** : Given the social need to find a common value base to connect common core values of new religion embraced due to social compulsions and hearts desire to connect back to Vedic roots, it may be possibility that a ' Vedic Scholar at Heart, yet a social Outsider of Varna-ashrama frame' might have designed a new 'VRATA' which bridged the social gap between Varna Brahmin community and New-converts . Purely as a Social Bridge to bring together the people- mostly like modern ' IshwaraAllah Tero Naam, Ram- Rahim' models.   

  

Plausible ending of this argument: TRUTH is Universal. Worship format of Truth can take many shades of cultural attire. Satya-Narayana Pooja seems to be one such exercise; another similar model is 'Ganesha Pooja, Navagraha Pooja, Amman Pooja', and the like.

  

For contemplation please.
