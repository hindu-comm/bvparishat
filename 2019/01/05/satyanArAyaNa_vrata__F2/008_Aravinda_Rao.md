We see that both words 'Satya' and 'Narayana' are as old as the Vedas. Is it not possible that Satyanarayana was worshiped by the Muslims in the name of Satya pier? Bengali Brahmins might have adopted the naivedyam aspect while the puja remained purely Hindu and was adopted by the Muslims. We have not studied the different pirs worshiped by the Shia Muslims. Satyanarayana vratam is quite popular in the Telugu states too.

Hari Prasad Shastri is no doubt a big name as he was the teacher of A.J.Alston who has wonderfully summarized the philosophy of Sri Shankara in his several volumes. It seems he has made some hasty observation.
