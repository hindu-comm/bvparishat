One of the links shared by Sri Ken has already resolved the problem.

  

It says Satya pir is an adaptation from some folk cult. It is found among converts into Islam from Hinduism.

  

If it is theorised that it is from Islam into Hinduism , it means it is from Hindu folk cult to Islam back to Hinduism.

  

Most of the popular Hinduism has folk origins.

  

Vratas having folk origins should be no surprise.
