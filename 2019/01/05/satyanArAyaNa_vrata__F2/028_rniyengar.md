My two-paise contribution to the discussion:

  

Muthuswami Dikshitar (1775-1835) was a great South Indian Vaidkika, VaiNika, Upaasaka, music composer - a polymath. His compositions are in Sanskrit and MaNipravALam. It is known that he travelled widely and lived in Varanasi for several years, learning north Indian classical music and Yoga under Chidambaranatha Yogi. His composition:

  

shrI satyanArAyaNam upAsmahE nityam satya\~nAnAnandamayam sarvam viShNumayam

vAsavAdi pUjitam varamunigaNa bhAvitam dAsajana paripAlitam *bhAsamAna badarIsthitam*

*vaishyajAti kAraNam* vaTuvEShadhAriNam kaliyugaprasannam vasupradAnanipuNam

matsyakUrma varAhAdi dashAvatAraprabhAvam shankhacakrAbjahastam gurugughanuta prasiddham\|\|

  

is quite popular in Karnatic music. Dikshitar invariably highlights some special characters of the deity or the sacred location eulogized in the song. Here SatyanArAyaNa is equated with Badarinath. What is interesting is his statement:*vaishyajAti kAraNam.* Probably he knew something more about Satyanarayana legends. A general observation I have made in the old Mysore region is that business community families were the main votaries of the Satyanarayana-vrata. It used to be a family based ritual some 50 years back. Now a days it is more a pooja than a vrata and observed in many temples as a group worship on Full Moon day.
