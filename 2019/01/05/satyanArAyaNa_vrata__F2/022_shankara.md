Ramakrishnan ji,

  

I guess you read PV Kane's note (extracted from HOD) on Satyanarayanavrata that I had attached to an earlier post. In it, PV Kane refers to HP Sastri's comment in Desc. Catalogue of Skt. Manuscripts vol. 5 and article on Mahapuranas published in JBORS and summarises, 'HP Sastri says that the worship of Satyanarayana has a Mahomedan origin. It was originally (and even now in many places) called Satyapirer Puja.' 'The same author says that the Mahomedan custom of offering Sirni to Satyapir was adopted by Bengal Hindus as worship of Satyanarayana.'

  

Our questions can be answered only by someone who has made an indepth study of SNVK tradition.  

  

Tony Stewart in his book on the legends of Satya Pir, 'Fabulous Females and Peerless Pirs: Tales of Mad Adventure in Old Bengal' (OUP), focuses more on the folk tales centered on Satya Pir and does not discuss the origin of the tradition. Though he refers to Satyanarayana Katha a few times, he does delve into its origin or growth or its influence on Satya Pir's Katha.

  

regards  
shankara
