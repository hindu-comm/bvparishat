Dear Aravinda Rao Garu,

  

The roots of 'satya-nArAyaNa' is found inत्रिपाद्विभूतिमहानारायणोपनिषत् ....There is also a secret yantra which is implicit in the upanishad and the same yantra is carved in Satyanarayana Swamy temple in Annavaram. One may see the ground floor to have the glimpse of the yantra. At the bindu sthAna, the pillar is there which continues till 1st floor. On the 1st floor, the vigrahas of hiraNyagarbha-hari-hara.

  

Don't know about the antiquity of 5 stories related to this vrata.
However, we perform this at our home. When we were in Bengal, we used to attend 'nArAyaNa-katha' at our family friends' house. In Gujarat, we attended 'satyanarayana katha' where importance is laid to 'katha' bhAga. They take almost 5 hours for the puja and we must be patient enough to sit for 5 hrs at a stretch !

  

rgs,

sriram
