I faintly remember that the late Dr.P.K.Gode had written a paper saying that the Shiraa which is offered as a naivedya for the Satyanarayana puja in Maharashtra is not native to india.I have to go back to search for that article for exact reference.

  

In the meanwhile,Shankar ji.might enlighten us on this.  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
