Namaste,

  

*On a side note....on 'pir' issue at Telangana*

  

There is a large banyan tree in Mahaboobnagar called 'pillala-marri' (a telugu word) which means 'banyan tree with many offshoots / branches around the trunk'. This tree is supposed to be 700 years old and has become a beautiful tourist spot in telangana and people from far off places come to visit this tree.

  

Next to it is an encroachment by local muslims and placed a darga nearby and constructed a wall so as to divide the banyan tree & darga. This darga is supposed to be of a fakir and named the place as 'pirla-marri' (the banyan tree associated with 'pir' (fakir)).

  

There was lot of arguments b/w tourism officials and local muslims and ultimately the name 'pillala-marri' got stuck due to pressure from tourism officials. That beautiful banyan tree can be seen in the below link:
