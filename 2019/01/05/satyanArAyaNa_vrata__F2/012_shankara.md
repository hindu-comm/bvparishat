Namaste,  

  

Meanwhile, I could locate the other article of Hara Prasad Sastri wherein he mentions about Hindus imitating the Satya Pir Katha of Muslims. It was published in vol 14 of JOBRS and not in vol 16 as said in PV Kane's HOD vol 5 part 1. (Relevant pages from HP Sastri's article are attached to this mail).  

  

Title of the article is 'Mahapuranas'. While discussing the differences between the Bengali & Southern recensions of Skanda Purana, Sastri points out that Satyanarayana Vrata Katha (SNVK) is not found in Southern recension of Skanda Purana published by Venkatesvara Press, Mumbai while SNVK is found in Reva Khanda of Bengali Recension of Skanda Purana published by Bangabasi Press. It was in this context that he comments that 'the Mahomedan custom of offering Sirni to Satya Pir was adopted by Bengali Hindus as worship of Satyanarayana'. He makes this statement as if he had no doubt at all about its accuracy. What is more surprising is that PV Kane and other scholars who quoted HP Sastri in their works did not even try to challenge Sastri's theory.
