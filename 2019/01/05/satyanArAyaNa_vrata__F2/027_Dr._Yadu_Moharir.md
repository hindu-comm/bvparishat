As a side note, the first time I heard about the Satyanarayana pUjA was in North America. I had never seen this in Tamil Nadu in my younger days, although from a fairly orthoprax background. I later found that it is quite popular among Telugu and Kannnada smArta-s, but not with Tamils.

Additional comments & question:  

  

PV Kane's History Dharmashastra also mentions that SatyanarayaNa vrata is not found in Bombay Edition of Skandha puuraaNa but is there in the Calcutta edition of Skandha puraaNa.

  

Name SatyanaraayaNa is as a last name in Bihar and neighboring regions.  

  

As far as I know there is no mention or records of SatyanaaraaNa puujaa in Peshva Daftar. Peshva's were well known for their meticulous documentation of their accounting practices.  

  

Taking this into account along with Ramakrishnan's observation & commen does it not suggests that this "SatyanaaraayaNa ritual / vratakathaa" seems to have migrated slowly to Eastern and Southern regions on India.

  

Any thoughts on this would be appreciated from scholars.
