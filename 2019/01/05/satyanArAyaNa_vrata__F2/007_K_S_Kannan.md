It is not merely with Satyanarayana Katha.

  

And it is not merely the Occidental writers who indulge in such fantasies  

even where there is evidenced no logical/legitimate link.

Many Indian scholars, their veritable sepoys, take pleasure in positing such ideas,

anxious to prove they are more loyal than the king:

asked to bend, they delight in grovelling.  

  

There are many among Westerner scholars who suggest that Sankara was influenced by Islam,

or that Ramanuja was influenced by Christianity.

As sympathetic a scholar as ALBasham too stooped to suggest such ideas!

  

Political victory, won in wily ways, not unoften fathers  

academic rodomontades and educated desperados.
