Namaste  
  
I listened to the brief lecture on this topic given by Sri Veeranarayana Pandurangi, at BVP conference. I listened online. Current date of Brhadaranyaka upanishad (BU), given by western scholars, is about 800-600 BCE. Sri Pandurangi states that the vamsha brahmana of BU gives a lineage of about 50+ acharyas, and taking each generation to be about 30 years, the lineage must extend to about 1500+ years, thus pushing the date of BU to earlier than 2300 BCE. This is the essence of Sri Pandurangi's argument.  
  
However, with all due respect, I believe Sri Pandurangi's argument is not conclusive. In my opinion, it is not correct to assume 30 years for each generation. In BU, we have Yajnavalkya teaching his wife Maitreyi and also King Janaka. In such cases, the age difference between student and teacher is hardly going to be 30 years. The scenario is more like a 40 year old person teaching someone a few years junior or even senior to him. There is possibility of a 40 year old Yagnavalkya teaching a 50 year old Janaka. 50 year old Ajatashatru might have taught a 52 year old Balaki. From the evidence of the BU, we cannot rule out such possibilities. There is no hint in the BU that the ages of teachers is higher than that of the students. Adi Shankara is supposed to have lived only 32 years according to tradition. He must have had disciples who were elder to him. Such possibilities cannot be ruled out in an atmosphere, where there is a constant intermingling of ideas. Hence, to assume that on an average, each generation in the teacher-student relationship must cover about 30 years is not correct. Therefore, with all due respect to Sri Pandurangi, his argument, pushing the date of BU to earlier than 2300 BCE, is not convincing.
