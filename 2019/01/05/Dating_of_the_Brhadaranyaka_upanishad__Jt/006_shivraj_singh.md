 a) Do you doubt that "vamsha brahmana of BU gives a lineage of about 50+ acharyas,"?

No.//  
  
Thank you!

--b) If you don't doubt a) could there be 50 acharyas in a period of 800-600 BC? This would imply 4 years per acharya. My underlying assumption here being that one acharya "retires" and passes on the mantle to the new one. Just like in a king list. You may have a different assumption? --  
  
I am not making any assumption. I am merely pointing out the reasons why the argument (presented at the BVP conference) is not convincing to me. The argument struck me many years back and I abandoned it when I myself did not find it convincing.//  
  
  
I will repeat my question : In a 200 year period from 800 - 600 BC how do we fit 50 generation of Rishis given in the vansh brahmana?
