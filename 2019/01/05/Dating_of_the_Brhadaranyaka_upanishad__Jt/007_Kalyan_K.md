//I will repeat my question : In a 200 year period from 800 - 600 BC how do we fit 50 generation of Rishis given in the vansh brahmana?//  
  
Shivraj ji  
  
I will take an extreme scenario to explain this. Let us take the teaching of Ajatashatru as an example. The teaching is not voluminous. Say, today you obtained this teaching from Hiranyagarbha. Tomorrow you teach me. Irrespective of whether you are junior or senior to me, you are my teacher. Day after tomorrow I teach someone else. (Doesn't mean you have retired). And so on. Leave alone 200 years or 1500 years, a couple of months would be sufficient for 50+ teachers to come up. Dont take this example literally. This extreme example is only to show that assumption of hundreds of years is not necessary.
