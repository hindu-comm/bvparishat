//Certainly Maitreyi is not listed. Neither Janaka.//  
  
I am aware of this and it hardly matters whether Maitreyi or Janaka are listed. I gave this as an example to show that age gap need not be 30 years between the teacher and the person taught.  
  
  
//The lineage is of acharyas, not of who were debating//  
  
How does that change anything? There is no hint in the BU that the teacher is necessarily elder than the student or that they had 30 years age gap. Also, it is often the case that when 2 parties debate, the losing party converts to the school of the winning party, accepting the winning party as the teacher.  
  
  
//Neither there is any evidence for 32 years of Shankaracharya. We don't know it.//  
  
Which is why I said, it is according to tradition.  
  
  
//Nor it can be a matter of one teaching another for one year, and another teaching someone else next year, and so on, so forth. (This situation takes only 58 years as per your assumption).//  
  
How do you know the above? (By the way, the above is not my assumption).  
  
  
//It is not something a seminar where we are exchanging ideas. It is the case that one (who is a jnani) is answering others' queries. //  
  
Exchange of ideas does not require a formal seminar.  
  
Yajnavalkya (jnAni) answers queries of Maitreyi/Janaka. I dont see any evidence for assuming 30 year age gap between them. When such is the case, why assume 30 year gap between teacher and student?
