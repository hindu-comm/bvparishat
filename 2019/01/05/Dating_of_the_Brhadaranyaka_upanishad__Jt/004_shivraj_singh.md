Kalyan,  
I seek a clarification on your original post:  
a) Do you doubt that "vamsha brahmana of BU gives a lineage of about 50+ acharyas,"?  
  
b) If you don't doubt a) could there be 50 acharyas in a period of 800-600 BC? This would imply 4 years per acharya. My underlying assumption here being that one acharya "retires" and passes on the mantle to the new one. Just like in a king list. You may have a different assumption?

I  
am aware of this and it hardly matters whether Maitreyi or  
Janaka are listed. I gave this as an example to show that  
age gap need not be 30 years between the teacher and the  
person taught.  
  
  
//The lineage is of acharyas, not of who were  
debating//  
  
How does that  
change anything? There is no hint in the BU that the teacher  
is necessarily elder than the student or that they had 30  
years age gap. Also, it is often the case that when 2  
parties debate, the losing party converts to the school of  
the winning party, accepting the winning party as the  
teacher.
