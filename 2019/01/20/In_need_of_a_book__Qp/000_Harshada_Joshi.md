Respected Members of the group,

Namo namah!

I am in search of the following book. I tried a lot, but am unable to find the pdf of the same.

**The Text and Legends of the Brhaddevata by Muneo Tokunaga**.  

This is Tokunaga's Ph.D. Dissertation (from Harvard University, 1979). I am not sure whether or not this is published.  

Can anybody please guide me regarding the same?

I will be highly obliged.

Thanks.
