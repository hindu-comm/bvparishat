Dear scholars,

  

The word mleccha appears in the NBh under NS 1.1.7 in the context of a definition of a reliable speakerāpta:

  

*ṛṣyāryamlecchānāṃ samānaṃ lakṣaṇam*

  

The term mleccha is usually translated into English as barbarian, or outsider, non-Aryan, person from outside the Aryan community.  
On one hand it refers to the structure of the society: sages, Aryans, non-Aryans and  
on the other, the term mleccha also points to a different geographical location and the usage of a different/foreign language.  
  
  
My question is, would Jains and Buddhist (or Jina and Buddha) be also somehow included? could they be considered as Aptas?  
  
  
Kind regards,  
Agnieszka Rostalska
