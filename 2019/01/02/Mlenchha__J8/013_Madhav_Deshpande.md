Dear Agnieszka,

  

  The terms Ārya/Mleccha are contested between the Vedic/Hindu tradition and the Jain-Bauddha traditions. For a detailed discussion of this contestation, please look up my books:1) Sociolinguistic Attitudes in India: An Historical Reconstruction, Karoma Publishers, Ann Arbor, 1979, and 2) Sanskrit and Prakrit: Sociolinguistic Issues, published by Motilal Banarsidass, 1993. My article "Mīmāṃsā on the Linguistic Usage of the Mlecchas" \[in *Ancient India in its Wider World*, edited by Grant Parker and Carla M. Sinopoli, published by Centers for South and Southeast Asian Studies, The University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, 2008\].
If you don't have access to one of these publications, please write to me privately. With best wishes,

  

Madhav M. Deshpande
