Many other women might have dissuaded Ravana, offering themselves instead. The poet might have choses to mention one instance involving Dhanyamalini in the Chronological narrative and another, ie, Mandodari through the report of Hanuman. It is quite common for poets to narrate the story in a non-linear fashion.
