Thank you very much for this video.

I had a queation about this. The definition of Bhakti, about MahatmyajnAnapurvaka.... is this definition also in Narada Bhaktisutra?

I haven't yet read them, but someone says it is a sutra whereas somewhere I heard this was said by Madhvacharya.  
Probably Shi Madhvacharya was quoting Narada. Unfortunately I have not read both yet, therefore my curiosity.

Dhanyavadah.
