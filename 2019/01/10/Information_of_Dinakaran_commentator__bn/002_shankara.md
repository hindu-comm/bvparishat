Namaste,

  

As per New Catalogus Catalogorum, Subodhini tika on Raghuvamsa was not printed. But, the NCC volume containing this information was published in 1977. So, we are not sure whethere this commentary was published later on.  

  

Worldcat site also doesn't have any information of its publication. BTW, extracts from this commentary are included in Raghuvamsa editions of NR Acharya (NSP) and Nandargikar.

shankara
