Namaste,

  

I have a problem with this type \`service'. The people this is intended to help are those with means - mostly, they are abroad, already use computers, Internet and many such devices. On the other hand, you would like scholars, most of whom don't have a steady source of income, who have dedicated their lives to the study Vedas in a traditional way to work for \`free'. Sorry sir, this is misplaced enthusiasm. Please think of an arrangement for proper \`Gurudakshina' to people who help out with such work. And, whenever / however one learns, they have to pay Gurudakshina:

आचार्याय प्रियं धनमाहृत्य ..... (शीक्षावल्ली तैत्तिरीयोपनिषदि)Offer to the Teacher whatever pleases him

  

regards..............................yoga
