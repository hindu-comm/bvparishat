Namaste Sethuraman ji,

  

Thanks for the clarifications and am glad that the Pandits are taken into consideration. As you observe, this issue needs to be made a bit more systematic. Something along the lines of Patreon. The worst hit are the Pandits who are passionate about continuing their adhyayana, but are finding it difficult to sustain their families while doing it. So, many of them take recourse to Paurohitya, which once it starts there won't be any time for them for their studies.
