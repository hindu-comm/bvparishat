Subbuji,

  

In this case, the VedaVMS team has already encoded and proof-read Taittiriya Samhita in Devanagari, Malayalam and Tamil scripts. In fact their requirement, as I understand it, is not proof-reading but technical help in identifying the errors that take place during the automated script conversion process i.e. conversion from Devangaari to Kannada script or Devanagari to Telugu script. One need not be a Vedic Pandit to do this.  

  

I felt that the coordinators of Sanskritdocuments site would be able to guide VedaVSM team, based on his vast experience in the field.

  

They have already explained their requirement in the following post:

  

"We know it (Baraha) directly tranliterates the base version. In Tamil and Malayalam we do search and replace some strings and letters so that Vedic representation is more accurate.

We are not aware of language specific issues in Kannada hence the above request."  

  

regards  
shankara
