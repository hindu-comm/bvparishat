Dear Shri Yogananda,

I apologise not clarifying the issue. This post is for internet community for the audience you have correctly identified. We have been receiving useful feedbacks from Veda Learners who have seen our site and downloaded /used our books.

We are in touch with typical Vedic Pandits and  Vedapatashaalas selectively where we are making arrangement for donations through our well wishers or find a means to compensate (read Guru Dakshina) as rightly pointed out. We have been providing small amounts to pandits or purchase books for them so far depending on the advice we take and efforts put in by them. One Well wisher suggested that we should contribute or arrange donations for the ' Veda sadas' these Pandits or Paatashala conducts.  

We have been working on totally voluntary basis on non-commercial basis and this issue is being addressed. We may have to approach our well wishers and Veda Learning Groups for this donations/Dakshina to be directly sent to the beneficiaries. We are a virtual group and the first trial is being made.

Once again our Post was meant for a different set of audience which was not clarified.

thanks for your point of view, which is fair and justified.  

best wishes
