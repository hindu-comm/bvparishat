Respected Scholars,

NamonamaH.

I have a query with regard to the concept of vAkya in Sanskrit poetics. We have the definition of vishvanAtha that vAkyaM syAdyogyatAkAMkSAsttiyuktaH padoccayaH// sAhityadarpaNa-2/1

  

Kindly guide me to know the other texts in Sanskrit poetics which define the concept/definition on vAkya.

  

With sincere regards,

Kumuda
