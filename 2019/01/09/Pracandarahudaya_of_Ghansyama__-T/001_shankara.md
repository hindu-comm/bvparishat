Namaste,

  

As per New Catalogus Catalogorum, Pracandarahudaya was published from Belgaum in 1960. I think it is not available on the internet. You may have to look for it in University or Public libraries.

  

The following Ph.D. theses on allegorical plays would be useful to you.

  

Pratik Natakon Ka Udbhav Aur Vikas - Omkarnath 1967 (Thesis)

<https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.480646>

Samskrit Sahitya Ke Pratika Natakon Ka Samikshatmak Adhyayan - Jnanendra Kumar Tripathi 2007 (Thesis) <http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/handle/10603/10641>

  

Shodhganga site is down now. You may try later to access the thesis.

  

A number of Sanskrit allegorical plays are avaialble at [archive.org](http://archive.org). Please search there with right keywords.
