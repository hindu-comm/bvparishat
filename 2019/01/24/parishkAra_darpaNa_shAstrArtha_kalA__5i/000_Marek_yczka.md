Namaste, Dear Eminent Scholars,

please could you shed some light on two navya-nyāya works:pariśkāra darpaṇa & śāstrārtha kalā?

Was the first edition in 1934 or early? (here is the link: <https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.368517>)

IsVeṇimadhava Śukla ji author of both or the commentary only?

  

Kind regards,

Marek
