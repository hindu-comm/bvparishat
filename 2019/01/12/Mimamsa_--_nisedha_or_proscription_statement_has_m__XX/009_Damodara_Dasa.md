Hare Krishna.

Respected V. Subrahmanyan ji,

  

There is a passage in the Jivanmukti Viveka of Swami Vidyaranya to the effect that 'Even if you are unable to comply with the vihita, what is enjoined, desist from performing the nishiddha, the prohibited.' I do not remember the exact passage. This instruction is to prevent one from incurring sin which is detrimental to him.  

  

Yes, I think this is the one which may help me. Can you find the exact source? Also if you can find the original source from which Vidyaranya Swami has arrived to this conclusion it will be of more help.

  

Thankyou,

Damodara das
