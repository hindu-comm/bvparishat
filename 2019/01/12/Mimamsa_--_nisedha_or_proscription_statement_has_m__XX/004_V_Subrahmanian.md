There is a passage in the Jivanmukti Viveka of Swami Vidyaranya to the effect that 'Even if you are unable to comply with the vihita, what is enjoined, desist from performing the nishiddha, the prohibited.' I do not remember the exact passage. This instruction is to prevent one from incurring sin which is detrimental to him.
