Hare Krishna.

  

Respected Subrahmanyam Korada ji,

  

Thankyou for these nice references. I think this will also be very helpful for my understanding.

  

The way you have put forward your presentation with examples is exactly what I meant?

  

As far as I have understood, you have concluded that in Vyakarana nisedha is stronger than vidhi. But in karmas, the contradiction between the two forms a vikalpa. This is because nisedha also presupposes a vidhi and thus when two vidhis contradict (of course from the pramana of same level) then it forms a vikalpa or option.

  

Have I understood properly?  

  

What if the vidhi statement oṛ injunction is not of nitya-kriya i.e. not performing that will not generate sin; while for the nisedha it is mentioned that performing that will produce sin?

  

Thankyou,

Hari Guru Vaisnava das,

Damodara das
