No. I think this only means that exception is stronger than the  
general rule when comes to application. For instance stool of any  
animal is contaminating (general rule). But then it is also said that  
"cow dung is pure." Thus it is settled that atthough stool of any  
animal is impure with the exception to cowdung.  
  
Thankyou,
