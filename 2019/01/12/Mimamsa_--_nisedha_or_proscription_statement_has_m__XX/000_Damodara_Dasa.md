Hare Krishna

Respected Vidvaj-janas,

  

I heard, long back, that in the matter of sastras the rule is that the nisedha vakyas have more weightage than prescriptions (or may be even injunctions). That means that if in shastras there is contradiction between prescription and proscription (nisedha) of something one should act as per nisedha and neglect prescription.

  

Does anyone here have any idea about this? Can someone send with references, proper understanding of this?

  

Thankyou,

Hari Guru Vaisnava das,

damodara das
