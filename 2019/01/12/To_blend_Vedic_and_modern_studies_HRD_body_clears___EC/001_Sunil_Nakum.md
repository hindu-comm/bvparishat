FYI, almost the similar pattern has been followed by the National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS) even for regular Secondary (10th) and Senior Secondary (10+2) level.

  

Four subjects namely, Veda Adhyan, Sanskrit Vyakaran, Bharatiya Darshan and Sanskrit Sahitya are clubbed as Indian Knowledge Tradition along with Sanskrit Language are available only in Sanskrit medium.  

  

Check out NIOS admission [prospectus for the year of 2018-19](https://nios.ac.in/media/documents/prospectus/ACADEMIC_PROSPECTUS_2018_19_FINAL.pdf).
