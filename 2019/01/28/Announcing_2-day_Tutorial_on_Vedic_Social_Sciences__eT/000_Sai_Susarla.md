You can register now by filling the [online registration form.](https://goo.gl/forms/evxeKLT915avQHed2)

  

Is there such a thing as Vedic Social Sciences? How does it differ from the mainstream ones? What new value can it bring to addressing social, cultural and organizational issues of modern society?

  

Prof. Paturi is keen to engage mainstream social science professionals, academicians and researchers, and in particular to inspire young scholars to explore Social Science research from the Indic perspective.  

  

We hope this tutorial will spur a slew of academic programs in the coming years.  

  

I invite you to join and also spread the word to those interested.

Regards,

\- Sai Susarla

Dean, MIT School of Vedic Sciences, Pune.

## About This Tutorial

Social science is the systematic study of human society and social relationships to predict social behavior. A comprehensive understanding of human psychological makeup and motives is crucial to deconstruct social behavior and address the proliferating social distress.

This tutorial highlights the social and cultural biases inherent in mainstream social sciences and humanities today. It presents the Vedic approach and how it can transform the discipline globally in a fundamental way.

## What you will learn:

-   India’s Indigenous Knowledge Systems and their contribution to
    Social Sciences & Humanities -   Critiquing mainstream social sciences and humanities from the Vedic
    perspective -   Introduction to Vedic Sociology, Vedic Anthropology, Vedic Political
    Science, Vedic Public Administration and Vedic ‘History’ – their
    global relevance for handling cultural diversity and conflicts. -   Potential areas of research and application of Vedic Social Sciences
    in the 21^(st) century.

## Expected Outcomes

This tutorial will help start rigorous academic study in various universities on the following lines:

-   through diploma, MA, and other PG and UG courses in Vedic Social
    Sciences -   through research courses -   through faculty research and publications
