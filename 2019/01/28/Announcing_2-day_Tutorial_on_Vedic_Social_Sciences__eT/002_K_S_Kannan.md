Prof. Paturi is answering to a key desideratum.

  

Most Sanskritists have often only vaguely felt that Indological research has  

somehow been hijacked by Western moulds and methodologies.

The insights of Prof. Paturi should surely go a long way in putting things on track.

  

Wish the programme all success!
