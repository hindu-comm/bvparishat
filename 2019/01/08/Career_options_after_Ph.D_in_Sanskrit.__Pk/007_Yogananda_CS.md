Namaste,

  

We should explore the Patreon platform \<<https://www.patreon.com/>\>. To begin with one should prepare some courses / articles and make them available. Then register on Patreon and offer them at various levels; whoever is interested will pay certain amount and participate in the course or read the articles, etc..

  

Nagaraj ji, may be we should organise a two day workshop on this so that lot of our scholars become aware of it and can be freelancer teachers. Prof S N Balagangadhara is on it. Please see<https://www.patreon.com/balagangadhara>

  

regards.................yoga
