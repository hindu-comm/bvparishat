Dear Members,

  

First PraNams to all of you on behalf of Veda VMS Group. Visit **[www.vedavms.in](http://www.vedavms.in)  
**

We are a group of working professionals and with a view to encourage Veda learning in vernacular (Esp in Malayalam and Tamil Languages)

we have compiled Books on Krishna Yajur Veda SAkhA. (books are also available in Sanskrit).  
All our compilations are available free for download.  

We have used Baraha Software to create this document.

We are looking for volunteers/veda learners to help us transliterate our documents into Kannada and Telugu languages.

**None of us know these two languages.**  

We request your help,ideas and guidance in this project.

You can directly contact us at **[ved...@gmail.com]()**  

Sethuraman - Veda VMS Administrator
