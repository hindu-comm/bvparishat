Dear Shri Siva Prasad,

We are learners at various stages and we are not qualified to handle Veda Bhasyam.

We have considered your view point. But we continue to receive requests to transliterate our documents in Telugu and Kannada. Your view point is highly appreciated. We will discuss it in our Group.

many thanks and kind regards  

Sethuraman
