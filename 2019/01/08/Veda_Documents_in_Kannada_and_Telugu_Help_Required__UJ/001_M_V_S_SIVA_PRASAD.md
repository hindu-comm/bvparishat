SIR, samhita books in telugu are available online for download in internet . And several vedic scholars scanned their books and using them in tabs. I feel your work in telugu is appreciable but here many vedic scholars are having the e-books which are without error and with highly standard of letters too. Even the font of them is better than baraha. So i suggest you to try for the veda bhashya in different scripts. Being so many vedic scholars study vedam in their mother tounge scripts such as telugu script,tamil script,malayalam script and kannada scripts. it becomes difficult for them to study veda bhashyam in devanagari script. At present veda bhashyam is available in only devanagari script. If you publish it in all the 4 dravidian scriptures ( telugu,tamil,kannada,malayalam) many vedic scholars and people will go for the veda bhashya study.
