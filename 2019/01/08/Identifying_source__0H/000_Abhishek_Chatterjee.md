Respected scholars,

These following verses have been quoted in variousbooks in defining the concepts of sin and righteousnessaccording to Hindu ethics.

  

श्लोकार्धेन प्रवक्ष्यामि यदुक्तं ग्रन्थकोटिभिः ।  
परोपकारः पुण्याय पापाय परपीडनम् ॥

  

The first half resembles a famous quote of Acharya Shankara. What is the source of the entire quotation?

  

Regards,
