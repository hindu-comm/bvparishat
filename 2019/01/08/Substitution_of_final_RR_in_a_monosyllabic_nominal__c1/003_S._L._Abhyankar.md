Dear Mr. Evgeniy,

While you say, "I haven't found such a meaning of that word in any dictionary.", I get the following from \<<https://dsalsrv04.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/app/apte_query.py?page=1030>\>. I usually search this dictionary using Unicode देवनागरी.

As can be seen below, पृ itself does not mean city. But पुरderived as \[पृ-क\] means a city.

The dictionary mentions two प्रातिपदिक-s meaning a city पुर् and पुर

-   "पुर्*f.*(Nom. sing. पूः; instr. du. पूर्भ्याम्)". -   पुर by its derivation as \[पृ-क\] is basically an adjective. But
    पुर*a.*\[पृ-क\]becomes a noun, meaning a city, because the action
    of the verb पृ is most commonly evident in "a place becoming a
    city".

Most nouns in Sanskrit, grammatically speaking, are adjectives. They got the meanings of those nouns, where the action is most evident. A commonplace example is of the word गजानन \[गजस्य (अथवा गजस्य इव) आननम् यस्य सः गजाननः (बहुव्रीहिः)\]. Inherently, words, which are बहुव्रीहि-compounds are adjectival.

  

पुर् pur पुर् 6 P. (पुरति) To go before, precede.
