Respected Scholars,

  

In his book "Sanskrit sandhi and exercises" B. Emeneau gives the following rule:

  

5\. Final ṝ of a root or monosyllabic nominal stem (except nṛ- ‘man’),

after a labial consonant and before a vowel is replaced by ur; not before a vowel by ūr.

After other consonants than labials and before a vowel, it is replaced by ir; not before a vowel by īr.

E.g., pṝ- ‘city’ + ā ⇒ purā ‘by the city’; pṝ- + bhyām ‘instrumental dual’ pūrbhyām ‘by two cities.’

kṝ- ‘scatter’ + ati ‘3d singular present’ ⇒ kirati ‘he scatters’; +yate ‘3d singular passive’ ⇒ kīryate ‘it is scattered.’

  

I suppose that this rule comes from Pāṇini sūtras 7.1.100 andsubsequent. But these sūtras mention only dhātus. What could be the reason of Emeneau saying "or monosyllabic nominal stem (except nṛ- ‘man’)"?

Also in his example he gives pṝ- meaning ‘city’ but I haven't found such a meaning of that word in any dictionary. Does it exist?

  

With best regards,

Evgeniy
