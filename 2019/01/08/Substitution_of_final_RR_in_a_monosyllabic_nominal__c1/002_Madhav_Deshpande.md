Hello Evgeniy,

  

  According to Pāṇinian commentators, the noun *pur* is derived from the verb root *pr̥̄*, and this *r̥* changes to *u*by Pāṇini's rule *ud oṣṭhyapūrvasya*. You can find the example *pūḥ*in the commentary on P.8.2.34 (Siddhānta-Kaumudī number 440), and some discussion in the commentary Tattvabodhinī on SK (Siddhānta-Kaumudī with Tattvabodhinī, 7th edition, Nirnaya-Sagar Press, 1933, p. 102). Within the Pāṇinian system, the nominal stem derived with the addition of a zero affix like KVIP still retains its status as a verb root, and the rules that apply to verb roots can also apply to such nominal stems. I don't know what Emeneau had in his mind.
