See Paniniyashiksha I quoted and the lines make it clear that they depend on the preceding vowels Anusvara and visarga. Don't jump into hasty conclusions as is usual for you. The lines quoted by you don't say anything beyond Sandhi rules and you again jump into wrong conclusions! It has nothing about pronunciation of anusvara!
