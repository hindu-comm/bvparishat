मोनुस्वार: doesn't mention pronunciation rule for Anusvara and neither the other नश्चापदान्तस्य झलि! They both lay down the condition of conversion of m and n. Sidhai has this: नासिकानुस्वारस्य! Both m and n are अनुनासिक consonants of pavarga and tavarga. This is described as per मुखनासिकवचनोनुनासिकः and anusvara is not considered as consonant.

  

You have not answered to my question why m and n be reverted in pronunciation.
