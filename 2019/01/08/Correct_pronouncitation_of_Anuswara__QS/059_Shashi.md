नमो विद्वद्भ्यः !

  

While searching for this topic of pronouncing anuswAra, I found this thread from almost 11 months back.

I have read all the replies and still have a few points/doubts to raise. Kindly humor me with your time.

  

I realize my limitations as a learner (and not as an expert), and I post this in all earnest.

  

  

1\. When फलम् पतति becomes फलं पतति - what changed? Script or pronunciation as well? If only script, then the pronunciation still remains as फलम् ? If only script, is it possible this was done to save space in writing manuscripts with scarcity of writing material? And so many pada ending in म् , this adoption could save considerable space.

  

2\. If all vowels and consonants have a स्थान like guttural, palatal etc, like the क च ट त प - वर्ग AND य र ल व श ष स ह as well, then why are nasals (anunAsika for the 5 varga) provided only for the 5 vargas *as separate letter and sound*? That is, these 5 nasal sounds are different, and also given different symbols in script. Then why not for the nasal (not necessarily the known/accepted anunAsika) that comes before य र ल व श ष स ह

  

3\. If anuswAra is a different sound, why is it not given a separate symbol, like ङ ञ etc? (This is different question than the last statement of #2) Why just a dot on top? And if dot on top is only for anuswAra, then anunAsika should never be written as dot on top. So, is सम्बन्ध = संबंध in pronunciation and writing? I have seen it written with two dots on top in print as early as a hundred years back, and in some manuscripts of whom I don't know the dates exactly.

  

4\. If in anuswAra, the lips must touch, and air only from nose, then no matter what consonant comes after it, as soon as the lips are opened, the sound that hits the ear is of 'ma' म labial, since the lips just parted. No matter if it सिंह ओर हंस both will sound like सिम्ह and हम्स . How can the anuswAra sound differently based on the consonant after it?

  

5\. Isn't the sound/letter/symbol of the dot on top decided by the consonant that comes AFTER it, and not before it? In this case:

In sandhi, most often the sound change is to facilitate faster speaking, and last consonant of the first word changes to the group of the first consonant of the second word.

सत् + चरितम् = सच्चरितम् / सत् + जनः = सज्जनः / तत् + लीनः = तल्लीनः . From this linguistic point of view, would the below not make sense?

  

संस्कृत \~= सन्स्कृत ( 'sa' being dantya)

संसार \~= सन्सार ( 'sa' being dantya)

हंस \~= हन्स ( 'sa' being dantya)

सिंह \~= सिङ्ह (ha being kaNThya) ) (This is how Punjabi last name gets pronounced today, singh (सिंह -> सिङ्ह -> सिङ्गह -> सिङ्घ / सिङ्ग), or even singapore from siMghapura)

संयम \~= सञ्यम (ya being palatal)

  

  

Language has to be learned interactively, but since Sanskrit has been so precisely described, I think some discussion can still happen in writing.

  

Dhanyavada.
