I found a forum on another group but I couldn't post there.  
  
Here, anuswara parasavarna is explained.  
  
My question is if anuswara is formed through naschaapadaantasya jhali, will it be pronounced as M or N?  
  
Maan dhatu = san.  
Dvitva.  
Maan maan. = sanyatah. Ittva.  
Mi maan sate. Deergha by sutra (man-dan-shan...)  
Meemaansate. मीमांसते.  
  
Here, anuswara is M or N?  
So many in south prnounce meemansate. Is that correct?
