Here's a view point from someone whose main interest is the Taittiriya Shakha recitation and the traditional phonology. In order to understand "correct" pronunciation, you need to look at vedic recitations, since this is the place where it is of paramount importance to recite correctly. I have a number of years of traditional training and continue to receive it and practice very hard, so it's something about which I am intimately aware. I think you may be drawing conclusions about pronunciation from how they are printed in Devanagari texts, which in my opinion are quite uneven as far as phonology goes, even the better printing presses. You may be aware of a script called grantha, used mainly in Tamil Nadu. The taittirIya texts printed in Tamil Nadu in this script, especially by the now defunct vaidikavardhini press, use a consistent printing - i.e., consistent with the pronunciation. However you need to be a part of the traditional learning to really understand how/why it is consistent.

  

This is because some of the consistency is obvious, while the rest requires you to be educated within the system. For the mathematically minded, if f(..., v, w, x, y, z, ...) is the functional transformation of the anusvAra in the \*printed\* text, where x is the anusvAra, and the other letters and the dots represent previous and later phonemes or phoneme-groups, then the function f is one to one, but not on to in terms of printing. That means a unique combination will produce a unique printed representation, but multiple combinations may have the same printed representation. But these are more due to some unique and relatively rarely occurring phonological features of the taittirIya recitation, so new notations are not invented for everything. But most of it is "on to", if we may be a little relaxed about the mathematical definition.

  

The issue here is what happens to the final makAra at the end of a word, but not at the end of a sentence. You are absolutely correct that in general the transformation of anusvAra depends on what comes after it, but at least in the taittirIya, it sometimes depends on what came before as well. This can be split as follows:



1\. anusvAra followed by sparsha (ka, ca, Ta, ta and pa varga-s) turn into the corresponding anunAsika - makAras-sparshaparas-tasya sasthanam-anunAsikam (TP 5.27)

2\. anusvAra followed by ya, la and va-kAra-s turn into corresponding savarNa-anunAsikam - antasthA-parash-ca savarNam-anunAsikam (TP 5.28) and na repha-paraH (TP 5.29)

3\. anusvAra followed by sa, sha, Sha, ha and ra-kAra-s have an ardha-gakAra before the makAra, but the situation here is complicated. There are various modifications to the rule if it is sa, sha, Sha, ha-kAra-s. These can be found in the vyAsa shikShA.

4\. There are other various exceptions, which I don't want to go into detail here, but more on one of them below.

  

Regarding the printing and dot symbol, the grantha texts use the dot only in the case of anusvAra followed by pa-varga, likely for saving space (one exceptional case below). In all other the corresponding anunAsika such as \~N, \~n, N and n are only printed. The second and third cases above have their own notation for the modification of the anusvAra as well. The taittirIya texts in grantha are very particular about this. But note that the same press when printing texts like gRhya sUtra-s, etc., use the dot symbol promiscuously.

Too much is made about labial vs nose. You are absolutely correct as soon as the lips are opened the ma sound will come. Here is how the one exception works:

  

example: saM + j\~napayanti (an actual occurrence in the taittirIya) should be sa\~nj\~napayanti. However it is printed as saM j\~napayanti (i.e., with a dot) - or remaining anusvAra. The fact that dot is used here as well as for a mAkAra says that the two sounds are in some sense similar. However here the dot is NOT a pure makAra (note the previous comment about the function not being on to). The vyAsa-shikShA says

  

j\~naghnottaro makaArash-ced-anusvAro.atra kevalaH 166  
dvimAtra iti vij\~neyo hy-anya-dharma-vivarjitaH 167  

  

The way it is distinguished from a makAra is that this case it is pronounced as two mAtra-s, and in practical recitation there is also a pause after it - as much as the pause at the end of a sentence - even though the sentence ending has not been reached! So it \*seems\* very much like a pure nasal sound.

The job of the phonologist to give a model of how the speech is spoke by shiShTa-s, i.e., a descriptive rule, and not what makes "sense" and give prescriptive rules. The anusvAra is treated quite differently by Rg and the kANva shukla yajur vedins, even within Tamil Nadu. Even within the yajur, the prAtishAkhyam notes dissenting opinions, although there is a single recitation system now. If I get time, I'll try to describe the Rg vedic system later, since I have some training in that veda as well.

  

You may find the section on anusvAra in my paper
