For folks who know Tamil, please watch this fantastic talk by Sri maNikaNDa ghanapATigaL given to students at the  
Sri Bharati Tirtha Veda Patashala titled "Vedanga Parichaya Conference by vidwan ganapadigal Manikandan on Shiksha & Chandas Volume 3". The legendary Sri Krishnamurthi SastrigaL himself describes the Sri maNikaNDa ghanapATigaL as "vyAkaraNattil puli" or vyAkaraNa-shAstre shArdUlaH, in his introduction.

This gives a fantastic description on why shikShA-s should be studied and more importantlyhow that knowledge should be used. There's also some discussion on the anusvAra.
