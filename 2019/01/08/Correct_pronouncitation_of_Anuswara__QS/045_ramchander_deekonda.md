Respected Scholars,  
  
It is my earnest request that any of the learned vidvAns in the group may please guide us with rules regarding this particular pronunciation. Please explain it in English (in brief as a thumb rule) enabling sanskrit lovers (non-specialists)like me can benefit.  
  
Since my school days no teacher has given me a clear cut rule position. I am still confused, if it is 'hamsa' or 'hansa', mAmsa or mAnsa. There is a clear divide between Hindi speakers and Dravidian speakers. A definitive ruling by scholars is certainly a welcome guidance.  
  
Regards,
