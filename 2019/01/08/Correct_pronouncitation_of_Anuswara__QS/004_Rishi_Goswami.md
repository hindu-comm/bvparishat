I don't know, therefore I am asking.

My speculation is that the anuswara formed through Monuswarah is M in pronounciation and which is formed through naschaapadaantasya jhali is N in pronounciation. Rest, you guide me.

Niranjanji, The type of uccAraNa you propose is for kAdimAnta Varnas and Yavarala. we can just do parasavarna and pronounce accordingly. There is no parasavarna for ShaShhaSaHa. So i am not sure if we can or cannot pronounce like that, most probably not.
