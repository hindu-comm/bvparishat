Dear Shivraj Ji,

  

  In Sanskrit usage, the word संस्कृत has an Anusvāra, and neither "n" nor "m". The English spelling is only an approximation. The rendering of Sanskrit ऋ as "ri" suggests that this approximation began in North India. The English rule was initially stabilized in the region of Bengal, and one needs to look at the early British documents from Bengal for what spelling was then used to refer to Sanskrit.

  

Dear Kalindi Shukla Ji,

  

  The R̥gveda Prātiśākhya says: अनुस्वारो व्यञ्जनं वा स्वरो वा \[सूत्र १।५\]. Please consult Uvaṭa-Bhāṣya on this Sūtra: स कांश्चित् स्वरधर्मान् गृह्णाति कांश्चिद् व्यञ्जनधर्मान् । ..after a long discussion concluding with an unexpected conclusion.. तस्मात् स्वरव्यञ्जनातिरिक्तमन्यद्वर्णान्तरमेतदित्येव ज्ञापनपरमेवेैतत् सूत्रमिति सिद्धान्तितम् ।
