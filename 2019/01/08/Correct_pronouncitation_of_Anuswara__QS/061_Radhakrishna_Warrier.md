Perhaps the inability of many people to pronounce the anunāsika properly has led to the widespread practice of using the anusvāra in place of anunāsika. I personally have met very few people outside the Malayalam/Tamil speaking areas who can pronounce ṅ (ङ) and ñ (ञ) properly. I have heard ṅ (ङ) being pronounced like aṅga. There is no need to introduce the ‘g’ sound or an initial ‘a’. Similarly, many people pronounce ñ (ञ) as यँ or यं or even asन्य. There is no ‘y’ or ‘n’ sound in ñ (ञ). I think it is this inability to pronounce ñ (ञ) that has led the ज्ञ of यज्ञ or ज्ञानto be pronounced variously as gya, gna, dnya and so on. There is no g or y or n or d in ज्ञ. It is the conjunct of j (ज) and ñ (ञ). Other than these two sounds, no other sound should be necessary to pronounce ज्ञ.
