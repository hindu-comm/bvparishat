Is the pronunciation of this monophthong ‘ai’ ऐ the same as that of ai ऐ in modern Hindi / Urdu spoken in north Indian cities like Delhi? For example, the pronunciation of ऐ in such expressions as “ऐश करो भाई”?

  

The English word “bag” is written in Hindi as “बैग”. If this “बैग” were transliterated into south Indian languages like Malayalam, the transliterated word would be pronounced very similar to बइग.
