Yes. I had read this in the Tika, but really there was not much elaboration on this point.  
  
By Swara, I understood how pronounce Dhva(m)sa with the accent of my teacher, hear Anuswara was a Swara.  
  
And say for eg, in वनं गच्छति or in कृष्णं श्रितः it is pronounced as Vyanjana M.  
In other cases such as रु for अम्परकछव, by Sootra "नश्छव्यप्रशान्" we get to hear the N sound. Like "स्वीयप्रभूंश्च स्मरेत्"। Hear as well, it can be pronounced as a Swara with a correct southern accent, 【PrabhU(n)shcha smaret】 but this is how I have been pronouncing अम्परकछव्परकअनुस्वार.  
  
So where may I find this discussion? In Riktantra itself probably, in some commentary perhaps.  
  
Niranjanji, I feel about Om, the symbol may have arrived later on. In my book, it is simply written as ओम्. It can be written in a similar way in any given script, probably the symbol came into being to universalize it in all scripts and make it a symbol of our faith. And it did serve the purpose well.
