Thank you Madhavji. I will look into it.  
  
Thank you Bhatji for help. If my conclusions are wrong, what is the right way? Please tell me. If Parashritau is the case, can you please tell me what to pronounce Anuswara if Reph and Shal is ahead? Is it always Makara or something as Niranjanji suggested?  
  
  
This part was quoted by Niranjanji. As per Ayogavaha Parashritah, is this conclusion correct then?  

  
"Dear Rishiji:  
  
The anusvara is pronounced using the nasal svara belonging to the consonant that immediately follows.  
  
अंश (=अञ्श talu) or सिंह (=सिङ्ह -kantha) or ध्वंस् (ध्वन्स -danta)  
  
Please do correct me if this is not the case.  
  
Niranjan"  
  
  

Now, there was my conclusion of Monuswarah and Naschaapadaantasya jhali, another possibility of pronounciation as suggested by Niranjanji and the third as southerners pronounce it as M when it is before RephoSHma. Which of the three is correct?
