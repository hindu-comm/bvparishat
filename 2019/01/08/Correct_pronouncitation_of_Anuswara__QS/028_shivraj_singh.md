You may consult W. S. Allen's Phonetics in Ancient Indiawhich summarizes views of various Śikṣās and Prātiśākhyas.

Madhav,  
  
Is it possible to know which is the older form? Sanskrita or Samskrita? i.e the one with "n" or with "m"?  
  
Since various parts of the country seem to pronounce this differently is it an example of sound change?
