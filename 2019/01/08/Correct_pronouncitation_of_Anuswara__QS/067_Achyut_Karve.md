Dear Vidwans,

  

What kind of anunasikas are the nasikas which go into the making of the 18 अण्'s in the Paninaya Shiksha? For example अं, इं उं etc. Are these pure nasals or Anunasikas.

  

Panini has used the four Annunasikas viz. ङ् ञ् ण् and म् as pratyaharas in the Maheshwar Sutras. What about the anuswaras?

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
