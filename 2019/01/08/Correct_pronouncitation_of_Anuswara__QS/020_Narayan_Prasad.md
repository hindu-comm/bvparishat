\<\<So correct is मीमान्-सा, दण्-ष्ट्रा, सिङ्-ह and सञ्-शय. So this is my final understanding. \>\>

  

Actually anusvAra is not a representative sound of ङ् - ञ् - ण् - न् - म्, it has a unique sound. Of course, what you are telling is the usual pronunciation in North India. Just try to listen carefully the pronunciation ofसंसार from some Marathi native speaker and you will most probably hear सँव्सार, rather than सन्सार. So the pronunciation of anusvAra is highly affected by the local languages. One person told me, the anusvAra is pronounced very similar to ङ्(as pronounced in North India). Soकिम् , when followed by some consonant and converted to किं, will be pronounced sth like किङ् , i.e. sth like ng in king, but without the g.

  

Regarding uniqueness of sound of the anusvAra, attached please find the relevant para fromडॉ॰ अनन्त चौधरी (1972): "हिन्दी व्याकरण का इतिहास", पृ॰653.

  

Best wishes
