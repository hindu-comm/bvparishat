नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

While pronouncing अनुस्वार , one should close his mouth - both the lips should touch each other .

  

Most of the people , even in South , pronounce it with open mouth . My father used to say

-close your mouth while pronouncing अनुस्वार.

  

Self study of संस्कृतम् is not recommended . It should be learnt from a गुरु right from pronunciation.

  

धन्यो’स्मि
