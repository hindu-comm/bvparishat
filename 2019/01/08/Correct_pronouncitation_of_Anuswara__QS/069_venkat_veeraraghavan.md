Dear Shri Korada Garu,

  

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgaSRpozqdk>

  

In the above video (from 12 minutes onwards) there is a discussion on how the pronunciation of anusvara varies with veda, desha etc.

The talk is in Tamil but I think the scholars here will understand easily what the gentleman in the video is talking about.

  

Regards,

  

Venkat
