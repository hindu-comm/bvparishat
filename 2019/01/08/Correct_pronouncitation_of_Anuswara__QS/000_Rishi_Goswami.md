।।श्रीहरिः।।  
  
I have often seeing people incorrectly pronouncing anuswaras such as in पुंसि like words, northerners pronounce punsi instead of pumsi.  
  
And southerners tend to pronounce all of the words like मीमांसा or विद्वांसः as Meemamsa and vidvAmsah instead meemAnsa and vidvAnsah.  
  
I am not sure, but I think pronounciations should be according to the previous condition of the anuswara. If it is created through मोनुस्वारः then it should be pronounced as म् and if it is created through नश्चापदान्तस्य झलि, it is to be pronounced as न्. पुमस् word will be पुम्+सि in ङि and become anuswara and मीमांसा is formed through सन् in मान् धातु and becomes anuswara through नश्च sootra.  
  
I maybe wrong, but this was just my speculation.  
  
But what about words like अंश or सिंह or ध्वंस् whose previous condition is unknown to us, as to how these were formed? How to pronounce those correctly?  
  
Regards  
Rishi.
