I am confused. I am not so qualified to answer, still i will try to frame it why I thought so.

To know what is Anuswara, we look it Sootra:

मो ऽनुस्वारः ८।३।२३  
मकारस्य पदान्तस्य अनुस्वारः आदेशो भवति हलि परतः। कुण्डं हसति। वनं हसति। कुण्ड याति। वनं याति। हलि इत्येव, त्वम् अत्र। किम् अत्र। पदन्तस्य इत्येव, गम्यते। रम्यते।

Here we see Anuswara pronounced as M because it is been placed in place of M.

Then we see this.

नश्चापदान्तस्य झलि ७८, ८।३।२४  
नस्य मस्य चापदान्तस्य झल्यनुस्वारः स्यात् । यशांसि । आक्रंस्यते । झलि किम् । मन्यते ॥

Here like in Manyate, if Anuswara is in place of N, I came on a conclusion that it must be N in Yashansi and Namansi as well.

So, for really knowing what Anuswara is, I need to know what Bhashya has said. I have known it is Ayogavaha like Visarga and Upadhmaniya etc. But I haven't read Bhashya. If you could please guide me and tell me, I would be very greatful.  
Rest I just made up a conclusion which is wrong I feel.

Thank you.
