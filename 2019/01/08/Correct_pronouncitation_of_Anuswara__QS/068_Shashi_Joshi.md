Ramakrishnan ji,

First of all, thank you very much for a detailed reply.

In my queries, I didn't have Vedic Sanskrit in mind, only post-Panini.

  

Could you please reply to my queries from this standpoint?

Once again, thanking in advance, for your wisdom and effort to reply, and apologies for my alpa-buddhi.  

  
  

Thanks,  

\~ Shashi
