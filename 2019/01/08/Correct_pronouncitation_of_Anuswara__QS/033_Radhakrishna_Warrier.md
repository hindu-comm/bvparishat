Interesting discussion on the pronunciation of anusvāra. We Malayalis pronounce anusvāra mostly as “m”. For example “saṃsāra sāgaraṃ” is written as സംസാര സാഗരം (संसार सागरं) and pronounced as samsāra sāgaram (सम्सार सागरम् ). There is an exception when anusvāra comes before "g". Written Gaṃgānadi ഗംഗാനദി (गंगानदि) but pronounced Gaṅgānadi (गङ्गानदि). Did pūrva sūris prescribe any correct pronunciation for the anusvāra? For example, is there any mention of the correct pronunciation of anusvāra in Pāṇinīyam?

  

What is the correct pronunciation of the visarga? I have heard “karmaH” (कर्मः) pronounced as karmaha and also as karmah. Have the ancients prescribed the correct pronunciation for the visarga?

  

Regarding kṣa and jña (क्ष and ज्ञ), we Malayalis pronounce these sounds as conjunct sounds. In some cases, kṣa (क्ष) is pronounced as a hard variety of ṣa (ष), close to a conjunct sound of ṭ and ṣ (ṭṣa).
