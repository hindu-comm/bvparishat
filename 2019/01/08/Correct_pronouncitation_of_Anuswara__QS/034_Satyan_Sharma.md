Namaskara  
  
In old Punjabi language (15-17th cent.), the word संसार was also pronounced and written as सैसार. This ऐकार is a monophthong unlike the diphthong in Sanskrit. Here the anusvāra has changed into a monophthong svara which is कण्ठ्य. Could this tell us about how the anusvāra in the case of संसार was pronounced in the old Punjab region?
