Aaahhhh....  
  
Thankyou Narayanji, Neeleshji. I have a southern teacher of Nyaya and he pronounces Dhwamsa not exactly as Makar. He pronounces it as Dhwa(m)sa. It isn't Makara, but pretty similar to Makara.  
  
His lips don't touch and he pronounces Makara/half Makara. And a bit it sounds as Dhvau(m)sa. ध्वऊँस्। I never paid attention and asked him for I thought maybe southerners pronounced Makara like that in their language, so that's just his accent of speaking.  
  
It's exactly how you said it, taste of pudding can't be explained, it can be tasted only.  
  
99% of my query has already been solved through this clarification of yours, still 1% left.  
So, this AnuswAra is AashrayabhAji, as per Shiksha what does that mean in the text?  
By Ayogavaha Aashrabhajinah what should we understand?
