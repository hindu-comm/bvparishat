Respected Subrahmanyam Korada ji

  

If शास्त्रम् cannot tell anything about pronunciation, for what purpose have the Śikṣā-śāstrās been created? In case अविच्छिन्नगुरुशिष्यपरम्परा is enough for the learning of correct pronunciation, there would remain no purpose for the Śikṣā-śāstrās and even Prātiśākhyās. As humans are involved in अविच्छिन्नगुरुशिष्यपरम्परा, do they become immune to defects of pronunciation? As far I know, every śāstra is created for a specific purpose.

  

The closest to अनुभवश्च प्रमाणम् I found was अनुभवादयश्च यथासम्भवमिह प्रमाणम् (इह = ब्रह्मजिज्ञासायाम्) \[भाष्य सूत्र १.१.२\]. I guess, there the topic is different.

  

Inमोऽनुस्वारः, म् becomes an अनुस्वार, and so it may be inferred that म् and अनुस्वार are two different things. If both are the same, why is there a need to convert one into another? Then how is it inferred that अनुस्वार is to be pronounced as म् (closed lips)? If both are different, how can the rule of उपूपध्मानीयानाम् ओष्ठौ apply to अनुस्वार?

  

Kindly guide.

  

Regards

Satyan
