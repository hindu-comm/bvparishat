Sri Shashikanta Joshi ji.

  

Namaste.

  

Your goodness has very aptly as well as justly conveyed the fundamental doubts regarding anusvara. In my limited capacity, I,too, tried to receive

some authentic and convincing reply from different sources but was not completelysatisfied.

  

Though the role of a 'guru' can not be replaced by anyone in any field of knowledge, however, I believe, the use of technology (videos etc)may help us to some extent to know some technicalitiesof pronunciation. 

  

Thanks to all the scholars who have contributed so far in the discussion.
