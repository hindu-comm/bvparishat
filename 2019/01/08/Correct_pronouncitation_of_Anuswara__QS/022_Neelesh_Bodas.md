This is exactly what I wanted to say. (I was about to write a reply and saw this). Still continuing below -

\- अनुस्वार has its own unique sound.

\- अनुस्वार is not pronounced same as any of the वर्गपञ्चम (or, to that matter, any other letter).

\- अनुस्वार is not same as an अनुनासिक. ("अनुनासिक" is a style of pronunciation of existing letters, not a new letter on its own).

\- अनुस्वार is the only letter that is pronounced without using a mouth (purely by nose).

\- Pronunciation of अनुस्वार is highly affected by local languages.

\- I am a native Marathi speaker and I echo exactly what Mr. Narayan has said on pronunciation of संसार. A better example is the native-Marathi pronunciation of सिंह. It is not सिम्ह / सिन्ह / सिङ्घ / सिञ्ह / सिंव्ह etc. It is सिंह - with a very distinct pronunciation of अनुस्वार).

  

Lastly - The proof of the pudding is in the eating, say the experts. The correct pronunciation of अनुस्वार can only be "heard". Never "written down".
