Dear Goswami Ji,

  

  None of these Sūtras tell you anything about how the Anusvāra is pronounced. They simply tell us where it occurs. To find out the details of the pronunciation of sounds, please consult the Śikṣās and Prātiśākhyas. Even the Mahābhāṣya rarely discusses the pronunciation of sounds.
