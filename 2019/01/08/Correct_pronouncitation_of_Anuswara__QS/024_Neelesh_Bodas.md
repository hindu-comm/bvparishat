अनुस्वारयमानां च नासिका स्थानमुच्यते। अयोगवाहा विज्ञेया आश्रयस्थानभागिनः ॥

अनुस्वार, (and यमाः, occurring only in Vedas) are pronounced with the nose.

They are अयोगवाहाः = not present in the माहेश्वरसूत्राणि

They are आश्रयस्थानभागिनः = The स्थान of their आश्रय (the swara appearing just before them) also gets attributed to them. (there are conflicting / non-unanimous opinions on this among experts).
