For a very brief introduction to the kANva treatment of the anusvAra, see the recitation of the first three mantras, samhitA, pada and krama at<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS7PUIZfu_w&t=458s>and follow with the text at <https://archive.org/details/shuklayajurvedamkanva>

  

That should show you how the kANva-s treat anusvAra before the sibilants.
