Problem is pronounciation.  
  
I'm still not clear as to pronounce anuswAra as M or no.  
  
I spoke with my teacher today, he says if it had to be pronounced as Dhvamsa, simha or samshaya only, why would we need to add an anuswAra to it? Why not simply keep it as मकार?  
  
So as per him, what Niranjanji proposed is correct. And as per Paniniya Shiksha as well, we will only pronounce as adjacent letter, as Ayogavaha Parashriyabhajinah. So correct is मीमान्-सा, दण्-ष्ट्रा, सिङ्-ह and सञ्-शय.  
  
So this is my final understanding.
