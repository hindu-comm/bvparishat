Okay. Thank you so much Bhatji.

I think I'm still confused, so for pronounciation in shal pratyahar. I will read phoenetics in ancient india which would probably give me some clarity.

If there is any hindi tika available online for shiksha I will find it, if not then i will ask Shankarji for it.

Thank you so much again for help.
