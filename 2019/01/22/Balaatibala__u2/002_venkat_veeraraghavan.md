Dear Shri Sriram Garu,  

  

Thanks for this link. The mantra seems almost the same as the one in Savitropanishat. "catur vidha*phala* puruShartha siddhi prade"

The underlined 2 syllables seem extra from the one given in savitropanishat.

  

Are there any sources where this mantra is given with svaras?

  

Thanks again,

  

Venkat
