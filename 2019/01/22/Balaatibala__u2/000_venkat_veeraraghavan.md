dear Vidvans,

  

What are the sources for the Balaatibala mantras?

I have seen this referred to in the Valmiki Ramayana and mentioned in detail in the Savitropanishat.

  

Is there any living lineage where this mantra is practiced?

  

Also the mantra seems to be without svaras as per savitropanishad.

  

Is this a complete form?

  

  

Thanks,

  

Venkat
