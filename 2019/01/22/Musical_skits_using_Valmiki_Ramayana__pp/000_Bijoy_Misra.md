Dear friends,

  

Good morning.

  

I am sharing a video of an experiment I did two years ago.

The experiment was to conjecture how the text and the story

of Ramayana in Sanskrit might have survived through time.

It is a pure speculation to think that the retention was through

dramatization as a folk theater. Folk theaters and village

congregations existed from a long time as recorded in

Natyashastra. Then the question is: can the Valmiki's text

be dramatized? So was the experiment. I took three episodes

and tried to create the story in Valmiki's words. I omitted some

descriptive text, but kept the dialog text completely original.

Then I dramatized it through intonation, accent and melody.

I had some experience before in theater production during my

college days. All participants except Sugriva are my students

in a class I taught.

  

Though our India Discovery Center we search through how

the Indian society might have developed over time. This video

is a small speculative experiment. Please free to comment and

offer critique. I am grateful to many in the Forum for their

continued help in these efforts of reconstruction.
