Goloka.

It means abode of cows in general, but in fact it is the abode of Paripurnatama Purusha Krishna, where he resides in his infinite bliss, along with his gopis, cows, giriraj govardhan mountain, yamuna and viraja rivers, tulasi and all gopas and nandas which descended to Earth during Krishna Avatara.

Govardhana is also a very nice name. Gokula as well.
