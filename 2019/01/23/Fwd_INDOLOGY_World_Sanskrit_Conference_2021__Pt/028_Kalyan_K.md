Paturiji  
  
I am asking you again.  
  
Can you give me a list of 10-20 indologists in US who, according to you, are the "worst culprits" in bashing Hinduism?  
  
Also, apart from Sri Rajiv Malhotra's books, do you have anything else that points to a "growing fashionable trend" of bashing Hinduism?
