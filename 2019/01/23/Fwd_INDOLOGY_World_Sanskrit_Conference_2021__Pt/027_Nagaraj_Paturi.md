\> May be Rohan Murthy was not convinced either.

  

---- Rohan Murthy nowhere ever expressed his awareness of the books of Sri Rajiv Malhotra that you said you read were not convinced. So to say
'Rohan Murthy was not convinced either' is does not fit here.

  

You are not convinced is possible and noted. But that is inconsequential given the number of readers that are convinced by those books.

  

\> That I responded to a post is correct. But sample of a trend? I dont know and never implied that.  

  

-- That it is a sample of a trend is my statement and my information to you. So, " I dont know and never implied that. " is obvious.

  

\> Oh, so there are a "big number" of good guys but also a "growing fashionable trend" of bashing Hinduism. Isn't this the same as admitting there are indologists of all hues, which should not be news at all?  

  

---- Please read the sentence "Though uneventful journeys do not get reported as news,they are theones passengers love! " once again. What make news are the eventful journeys. We respond to the events because we are their victims.
