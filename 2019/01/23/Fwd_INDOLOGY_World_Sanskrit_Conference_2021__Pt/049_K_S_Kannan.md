The abundant and apposite material presented by Dr Vishal Agarwal and Prof Nagaraj Paturi

should be compulsory reading for anyone, especially the younger generation, stepping into Indological studies.

  

It would be ideal if these/kindred ideas in their theoretical aspects

as well as commentaries on contemporary scholarship  

are presented in book form, and made available in various languages

through various media.
