Most products oriented to India and Indian studies can be called garbage!

It is changing, but an old pattern has developed of examining from a

"big brother" point of view. India as understood by a native Indian is different

what you read in the literature. The calibration is different! There are

few sympathetic researchers who appreciate the Indigenous culture.

Mapping India as Europe has been the mistaken track!
