//I am surprised to see how you could manage to ask this question even after reading the following paragraph by me in specific reference to WSC://  
  
  
Ok. Thanks for pointing it out.  
  
//That said, coming to the word " fashionable" , " growing trend" etc. , I don't need to reinvent the wheel or waste the resources of this forum in reproducing all that is already covered in well documented elaborate , big volumes already published on this growing trend and fashion.//  
  
Alright. Can you point me to some of these elaborate, big volumes that were already published? If you mean some of Sri Rajiv Malhotra's books, already read them and not very convinced. (May be Rohan Murthy was not convinced either). If you mean something else, let me know. At least can you give me a list of 10-20 indologists in the US, who according to you, are the worst culprits?  
  
//The post to which you responded is just a sample of a trend in various such forums.//  
  
That I responded to a post is correct. But sample of a trend? I dont know and never implied that. Neither swadeshi nor videshi should be bad words.  
  
//It is heartening to see that there are still a very big number of Sanskrit scholars in US, who still live the sensitivity encouraged by likes of Prof. Ingalls.//  
  
Oh, so there are a "big number" of good guys but also a "growing fashionable trend" of bashing Hinduism. Isn't this the same as admitting there are indologists of all hues, which should not be news at all?
