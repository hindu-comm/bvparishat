The colonial "standardization" attitude in scholarship in the west is not confined to indian studies

but extends to Black studies, sociology, psychology, anthropology and other fields of humanities.

It is not the fault of the present generation. The current people are only carrying the legacy.  

People like us who left India during the political troubles only discover such bias in-house here..

Many people of Indian origin wish to accept the status-quo and assume vain superiority.

The problem can only go when India herself would produce scholars who can articulate

views to an international audience. I think we are making progress.  

The whole legacy is to portray India as a divided nation. What we observe is that India has

been a unitary nation from the remote past. There is a certain cultural Indian-ness that

binds the nation! Dividing India was probably necessary to help administration. Division

was purely a British invention and they wrote history to make the point.. We will study

more and I will report.
