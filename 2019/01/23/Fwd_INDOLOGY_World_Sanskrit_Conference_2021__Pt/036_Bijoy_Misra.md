Dear Sri Pillai,

Diversity of opinion is not ignorance.  

You need a good training in Nyaya to understand what is a valid discussion.

  

Are these "rhetoric" posters into Sanskrit and Indian scholarship?

Their language appears disrespectful.

  

Free speech is not arbitrary speech! India went through this two thousand years ago!
