Namaste

  

I do not see anything wrong in the description of Vaishnava families in the attachment. Even today in Madhva Maths there is a separate treatment for Madhvas and other types like Smarta Brahmins. In 1970s itself in Udupi my parents faced this. For taking lunch they had to sit separately on ground floor. Madhvas took lunch on first floor. With my own eyes I have seen they do not sit with other Brahmins for lunch. They want to eat separately. This is happening in 21stcentury and not 13th century.

  

Kindly check your facts before making allegations. We cannot deny historical facts and wish everything is fine. It is not.
