Venketash,

  

You have to see the purpose for which this example was given - to deny that there is a faith tradition called Hindu Dharma, and thus deny the legitmacy of all Hindu groups clamoring that Hinduism be given equal respect as other traditions. Madhav Deshpande followed the typical Indian leftist trope (advocated by other anti Hindi academics at that time, like Vasudha Dalmia) that Hinduism is a 19th century construct. In their testimonies to the California Board of Education, they referred derisively to our tradition as 'what is now called Hinduism since the 19th century' . They branded 11 year old Hindu children appearing as witnesses and victims of harrassment by their classmates ('do you worship monkeys'? 'Is the cow your mother'?) as 'Hindu fundamentalists/nationalists', and even teamed up with terror groups like FeTNA, Khalistani orgs and so on to brow beat Hinduism. This is NOT love for history - this is pure hatred. What is the use of this scholarship and chanting hari vitthal and so on if there is poison inside their heart? On Indology forums, he has actively championed the works of Hinduphobic Leftists like R S Sharma, Rajesh Kocchar and so on.

  

My own children have undergone education in US schools and I know what they and their classmates have faced. My son just zoned out in the classes on Hinduism and told me, "I just ignored what the teacher said, but you had told me the other side. Not all of my Indian friends knew the other side." Students have told me how our Devi Devas were branded as satan and witches by their teacher; that Hindus are responsible for the Kashmiri Muslim terrorism per their teachers and so on. This is REAL, not a fiction or my imagination. Textbooks of sixth grade are no place to promote Hinduphobia but these Gungadins will gladly collaborate with racists and terrorists to brow beat our children and brand them as Hindu nationalists! I actually now teach Hinduism in High and Middle Schools here (have gone to 6 in the past one year) and know for a fact how bad the textbooks are on India and Hindu Dharma. And these Gungadins and racists will make sure that they continue to be bad, prejudiced and hate filled.

  

There was rampant Jihads, Jaziya, witch hunting and so on in other faiths too, but the textbooks are silent about them; and these same Gungadins and racists suddenly forget their historical acumen when it comes to other cultures and traditions. Which shows their nefarious agendas at work.....

  

When it comes to the dignity of my children, I will not mince words. No parent should. The result of this hatemongering are seen frequently - just recently a Swaminarayan Temple here was vandalized. Our own local temple was vandalized just before it was inaugurated.

  

I hope that the emails of Comrade Kamala Vishveshvaran and of the the son of Baptist Christian Missionary parents in Shillong- Jonathan Mark Kenoyer, are made public soon.

  

Vishal
