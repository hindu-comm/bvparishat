Attached is a summary of the problems with CA Textbooks in 2005-2006. It was published in the journal 'History Today'. The paper gives 100s of real examples from these problematic textbooks, including dozens from Kenoyer's OUP book (I still have a copies of all of these textbooks preserved with me).
