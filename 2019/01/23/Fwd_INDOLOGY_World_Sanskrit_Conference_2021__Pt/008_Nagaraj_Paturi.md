Humans at a popular level are always driven by syllogisms such as ' a certain celebrity of , say, movie field drinks a certain instant beverage of a certain brand, so one who drinks that beverage can become a celebrity of movie field. '

  

This popular human logic is exploited to their advantage by commercial advertisers.

  

Imitation of the costume , language , religious beliefs etc. of rulers by the ruled always happened because of such popular syllogisms only.

  

Wrongly attributing the 'victory' of the British colonisers to Christian monotheism, to the absence of caste in the European society, to the birth and development of science etc. in Europe lead to many Indian reformation movements imitating monotheism, going against caste and blindly worshipping science, etc. Cultural influence of the colonisers on the colonised happened because of such syllogisms only.

  

Worshipping the western understandings in Social Sciences and Humanities to the extent of worshipping their understanding of India, Indian literatures, cultures etc. too is rooted in this kind of wrong connections made between 'success' of one individual or society and the features of that individual and /or society that are not at all connected to that success.

  

Wondering how the USA is still one of the most technologically advanced nations on earth --- is one of the reasons for the worshipping attitude towards American Indologists and their Indology among many Indians.
