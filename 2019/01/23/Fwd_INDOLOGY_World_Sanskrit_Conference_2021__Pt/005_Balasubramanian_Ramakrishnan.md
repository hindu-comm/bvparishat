Dear Prof. Prasad,

  

The academia here (in the US) can be very fashion driven. This is not just in the field of humanities but in the hard sciences and engineering as well. Some topic(s) or the other will capture the attention of some "influential" folks and pretty much everyone will follow suit, since research dollars are controlled by these Kim Kardashians of the academia. I must sayit's probably worse in the hard sciences and engineering. In the earlier days it was advaita vedanta, due to whatever reasons. Then it was tantra, tantra, tantra. Now it is yoga, yoga, yoga. But you can be sure of one thing, the basic theme will NOT change

  

1\. Hinduism = casteism - bad, bad, bad

2\. Hinduism = suppression of women - bad, bad, bad

3\. Hinduism = something which cannot be talked about by Hindus - bad, bad, bad people

4\. Hinduism = no respect for animals and the environment - bad, bad, bad.

5\. Practicing Hindus do not understand what vedanta/tantra/yoga/latest-research-fad is - bad, bad, bad, people, they really need to listen to the white man.

  

The general trend is to import whatever the latest garbage sociological/anthropological ideas which are in vogue, and force fit them to arrive at the five conclusions above. You just need to pick a new "topic" that's all. Sorry, but that's what I have been seeing all these years.

  

Ramakrishnan
