Dr Kalyan seems to be making a fetish of argumentation.  

His animadversions betray him more as a censorious being than as a non-partisan thinker.

  

On the other hand, there is a great amount of truth in what Dr. Balasubramanian Ramakrishnan is bluntly yet plainly saying.

And the amount of patience and sense being evidenced in the posts of Prof Nagaraj Paturi are rather unusual.

  

Kalyan speaks of the great advances in science and technology, as if
all advances in science and technology have been great,  

or under an assumption that all the "great" advances have been beneficial to humanity.  

  

As to trends and fashions in science too, one may perhaps look into the writings of Kuhn, or even better, Feyerabend, or better still Polanyi.

One must only recall the statement "Science is what scientists do" that well summarises that scientists are humans too,

and realise that science has not always been impervious to fads and fashions, or to prejudices and predispositions.  

And it is not for nothing that it has been remarked that the path of progress in science is littered with discarded theories.  

Of course one ought not to speak of the master fund-suckers that scientists have always been irrespective of  

how well their theories fared before and after they were discarded.  

(Was it Sagan who noted that 90% of the scientists have been in the current century?)  

  

Lest I be misconstrued, it is not science as such that I am indicting,  

but the likes of Kalyan who speak from an ivory tower,  

and have a fantastic notion of science as a glorious pursuit,  

oblivious to the fact that there is no science apart from its practitioners  

\- scientists who are no embodiment of reason, pure and simple, but very much are humans  

with their own quota of ambitions or prejudices, and fancies, frailties and foibles.

To be fair, Oppenheimer laid bare the truth of this fairly poignantly.  

(And I am not speaking of dishonest scientists who are in no small number either).  

Science always looks glorious by hindsight.  

  

As to technology, it is not cynicism alone that has inspired the remark  

"technology has brought meaning to the life", and as it adds, "of technologists"  

(yes, the deified purveyors that have also wrought devastations in no small measure,  

with not even a modicum of compunction). Economists do not fall very much behind them either,  

which is why Schumacher had to subtitle a book of his as "A study of Economics as if people mattered".  

It is not for nothing that Winograd, Weizenbaum, or Hawkins caution us against Artificial Intelligence.  

(And the less we speak of Genetic Engineering the better).  

While true scientists are humble and hesitant, their salesmen, like Kalyan & Co.,  

are suffused with a beaming confidence of their proprietorship over truth.

All this was to corroborate the ring of truth in what Balasubramanian Ramakrishnan said, and much more.  

  

Kalyan's championing of the ilks of Pollock is another issue,  

and Prof. Paturi has shown the essential fallacies of his thinking,  

and I am spared the trouble of giving a fair picture of the situation.  

Brainwashed sepoys, whose adulations and admirations of the White Man's Burden are in no small measure,  

are to be found even to this day, and in august company of those who, like the celebrated presstitutes,  

understand the language of the dollar and little else.

  

**Tailpiece - Today's newspaper carries this precious news item:**

"When European settlers arrived in the Americas, they killed over 56 million indigenous Americans ...  

\[and this\] resulted in a massive decrease in Carbon Dioxide in the atmosphere... enough to cool the earth.  

\[It\] directly contributed to the success of the European economy... and helped European population to expand..."

  

(Was it only in America that Europeans showed their true colours?  

Ask Alain Danielou about the cultural genocide in Africa. idam upalakshanam of their lakshanam.  

Aren't cannibals more sensible than these vermins, the scum of the earth?  

Please excuse my mildness.)
