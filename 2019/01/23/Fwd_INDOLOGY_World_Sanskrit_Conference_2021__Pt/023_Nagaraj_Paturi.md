To bring the discussion back to track, to fall within the focus and scope of our forum, let us see from where - hating the subject matter of the disciplin- i.e., Sanskrit,kavyas and other literature in it, ancient Indian knowledge systemsetc., becomes a fashion in Indological studies in the west and /or in US.

  

Prof. Wendy Doniger in her article on Bhagavadgita in which she tries hard to show BhG as a bad book says,

  

*“*The Bhagavad Gita is not as nice a book as some Americans think…Throughout the Mahabharata … Krishna goads human beings into all sorts of murderous and self-destructive behaviors such as war…. The Gita is a dishonest book …”  

  

This sentence "The Bhagavad Gita is not as nice a book as some Americans think" says it all. Their audience are Americans. Their concern is that Americans think that Bhagavadgita (and many works in Sanskrit ) is (are ) a nice book. The book American Veda by Philip Goldberg gives us a picture of the extent to which some Americans developed a 'nice' image of India, Sanskrit etc., and why it gains such a significance as to need a counter to remove that impression.

  

It is a different matter that to achieve this they resort to such statements as "Throughout the Mahabharata … Krishna goads human beings into all sorts of murderous and self-destructive behaviors such as war…." which look laughable to even common audience of BhG pravachana that have been attending such pravachanas for millennia. None of them felt goaded to murderous behaviour. There is evidence to show that for millennia the book has been taken as a book guiding towards vihita karma performance , duty as a soldier of the military of the kingdom or the nation being only one of many such vihita karmas or svadharmas for the audience coming from numerous social group backgrounds of the traditional and contemporary social orders., with a karmaphalasnnyaasa approach, karmaphalasannyaasayoga being only one of many paths instructed by the book.

  

But their audience are not the millions and a billion of Indians who would definitely laugh at such a naivety in understanding the book. Their audience are the Americans who think that BhG is a nice book.

  

This is one of the reasons for the hating the subject matter of the disciplin- i.e., Sanskrit,kavyas and other literature in it, ancient Indian knowledge systemsetc., becoming a fashion in Indological studies in the west and /or in US.

  

There are a few other reasons too.
