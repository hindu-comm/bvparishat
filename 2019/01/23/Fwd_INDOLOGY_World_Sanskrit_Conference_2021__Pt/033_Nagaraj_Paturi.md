To 'show' not 'say' is being done by various conferences and publications and Prof. Kannan has been leading significant part of that activity from the front.

  

I agree with the view that 'the humanities are significantly devalued in today's world and within it Sanskrit/Indian Cultural studies constitute an even more excluded domain'.

  

That is another reason in many western countries some academicians choose to show to their funding sources that their academics are useful to their governments and societies by helping them understand the past of countries like India without which understanding the present of countries such as India is difficult. In the process of arguing for more funds on this basis to their fields they directly mention the names of Indian political parties and their successes and failures and connect them to Ramayana and its content, Sanskrit and its creativity etc. When the flaws in those arguments, just in terms of Ramayana and its content, Sanskrit and its creativity etc are 'shown' not 'said' without any mention of the names of Indian political parties and their successes and failures , they say 'this is politics. You are doing politics.' 'Care should be taken to avoid politics' etc.
