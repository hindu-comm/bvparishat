\> Since this thread is about WSC, do you have evidence to show that there is a systemic bias against Hinduism in that forum?  

  

I am surprised to see how you could manage to ask this question even after reading the following paragraph by me in specific reference to WSC:

That said, coming to the word " fashionable" , " growing trend" etc. , I don't need to reinvent the wheel or waste the resources of this forum in reproducing all that is already covered in well documented elaborate , big volumes already published on this growing trend and fashion. You seem to watch some lists. This I am able to say on the basis of your recent response in this forum to a post by one professor. The following was your response at

The post to which you responded is just a sample of a trend in various such forums.

  

I expressed my awareness that this is not all of Indology, in another post of me at the end of which I said,

(please note the highlighted end part of the passage0:

  

1. Dealing with the classics of a community which has living practitioners of various aspects of culture such as the religion contained in those classics,is different from dealing with the classics of a community which no longer has living practitioners of the religion and other such aspects in those classics. Availability of these living practitioners is both a problem and an opportunity. Problem because the practitioners react/respond to what has been said about what they live, in the study of the classics that contain the aspects that they put in practice;opportunity because the student of the classics can take the help of study of the practice in understanding the classics.

2. What Prof. Ingalls did to Sanskrit studies, in the form of exposing, criticizing and countering the “monstrous” (-not my word-) Eurocentric study of Sanskrit material, was very much similar to what cultural relativists did to the study of various world cultures. He made Sanskritists aware of the cultural sensitivity keeping in view the sensibilities of the culture insiders.

Cultural relativists evaluate the validity of their study by taking back their study to the studied people and testing it for cultural sensitivity.

3.Deromanticization, i.e., undoing of the romanticized presentation of the ‘positive’ of a culture studied need not necessarily be in the form of the other extreme, the romanticized presentation of the ‘negative’ of the studied culture.

When I go to fieldwork in Indian villages, the villagers keep asking me, “Are you going to present the same old feudal time picture of our villages that the movie guys present, a cruel landlord replacing the bullocks of a cart with the agricultural laborers and whipping them to bleed and so on?”

It is heartening to see that there are stilla very big number of Sanskrit scholars in US, who still live the sensitivity encouraged by likes of Prof. Ingalls. **Though uneventful journeys do not get reported as news,they are theones passengers love!**

Thanks and regards,
