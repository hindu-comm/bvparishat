Are we then to turn a blind eye to the avalanche of literature produced (and being produced)  

deploying vicious socio-political lenses devised and controlled by the White Supremacists and their proteges  

upon Sanskrit in particular and the Hindu heritage in general for the last 250 years

\- unmistakably engendering and buttressing the Breaking India forces consistently?

  

As Rajiv Malhotra has pointed out time and again, it is only the Hindu Studies  

that have all along been under the unrelenting stranglehold of non-Hindus - the Whites/Christians,  

(and their "heathen" sepoys in India or abroad) waiting for the crumbs from their tables.  

  

(Would they even contemplate attempting this for Urdu/Islam/Judaism?

Do they have the nerve to "psychoanalyse" the Prophet as they do Rama or Krishna or Siva?

And what deters these pusillanimous hooligans? Simple: the language of *daNDa*!

Has this not been vitiating a vast readership (and leadership) within and outside of India?

Don't they have a better business to do?  

  

Imagine a 150-year old "civilisation" of brigands, pirates, and plunderers  

(or a 100-year old "philosophy" of totalitarianism that withered in its own land of birth)  

teaching lessons of living to a 5000-years (or more) old stable civilisation  

that attacked none to impose its philosophy on ?

  

Who is interfering, and who is causing disruption, Dr. Bijoy Misra?

And who are we to be afraid of, please?

  

Let us respond academically, of course, to those who are genuinely academic.

Should we fight shy of confronting those acting by subterfuge
