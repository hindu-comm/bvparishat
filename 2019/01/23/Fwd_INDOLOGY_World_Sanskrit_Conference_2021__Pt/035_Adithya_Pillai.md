I am sure everyone who is subscribed to this list is here because they wish to be a part of a community that cares about aspects of Indian past. I am sure Prof. Kannan's work is important and his concerns and his remarks about the scholars cited are coming from a legitimate place. But i hope he also sees why it is legitimate to accuse his last argument (and the point that a critical appreciation of the very real issues of funding-based influential paradigms within Science, Technology and the Humanities need not necessarily have anything to do with countering a 'White Man' bias. Even if the paradigm is illegitimate, the argument should be that we are countering it because it is *wrong*, not because some soft-headed people have certain dispositional features or monetary arrangements that made them succumb to the paradigm.) as uncalled for and 'rhetorical'. We have to be more measured.
