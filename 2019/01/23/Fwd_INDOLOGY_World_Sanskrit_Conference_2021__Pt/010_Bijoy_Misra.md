Lately from our analysis, we find that fashion is an expression of
declaring personal freedom unimpeded by any process of consumerism or religious laws.

We have the reason to believe was that eleventh century India was most fashion oriented as seen any time anywhere in the world. This would express

in dress, ornaments, hairdo, makeup and continue to food and living. It would continue to music, dance, arts and performance. No two would

be like and rarely there would be a repetition. Our analysis is derived from the literature of the period, temple sculptures and available travel diaries.  

The logic we develop is that fashion drives a custom market and a product is individually produced. So there was need to export products to distant

markets etc. High fashion was associated with extreme opulence in society and individual taste was tolerated and admired. We think such fashion

led to the production of Sangeeta ratnakara as a text in later time. We lately use the phrase "improvisation", which is a term for customization.  

  

I will post our notes in course of time.

  

Best regards,
