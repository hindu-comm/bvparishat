Not sure what you are trying to achieve here, Before I try to explain what I said (glad to see Prof Paturi has understood what I was trying to say), I would like to know your background. Have you done any research in the US? I would like to know what background you have in STEM/S&T research in the US. Let me tell you mine. I have a Ph.D in a highly analytical field - information-theory/bayesian & mathematical statistics in communication theory problems. I have worked in the satellites area for 20+ years in a research/development area.
