Dr Shri Misra,

  

I appreciate your concerns and in general, refrain from posting these types of messages. My reply was prompted by skepticism on whether such biases even exist or not. Many of these biases are prompted by the political proclivities of these same professors. Which is why, we find them signing political petitions in the name of 'academic free speech'. I have not merely given my opinions - I can quote chapter and verse to demonstrate their hatreds in writing. Much of this is available online for anyone to verify.

  

We cannot be so charitable towards Hinduphobes when they brand our children as dangerous Hindu Nationalists. I hope you understand what I mean. These are not just some scholars totally lost in their research, but activisits filled with hatred who lead a Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde lifestyle. You know Witzel well to understand what I am saying. Being from India, and of a Hindu heritage, we often tend to think that scholars of our tradition are also necessarily good human beings, and worthy of respect. Alas, interactions with them often reveals that they are below average in their ethical values.

  

The Vedas can stay with Brahma, or they can come under the possession of Asura - isn't there a difference between the two situations, as our heritage teaches us?

  

Of course, people can chose to remain 'shatranj ke khiladi' while the Sepoys roll into Awadh of Shri Rama.

  

Vishal
