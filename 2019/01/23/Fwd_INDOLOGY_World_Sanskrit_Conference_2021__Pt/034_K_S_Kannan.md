I have done a course in Philosophy of Science at IIT-Kanpur informally when I had quite an occasion to interact with the Dept. of Computer Science there, and *I hope this helps* the likes of Kalyan and Pillai who rather find an easy escape route by making accusations of rhetoric and names-dropping - in lieu of attempting to answer issues raised point by point. Uncalled for deployment of exclamatory marks is also rhetoric (and incidentally, attributing the exclamation mark to me by including it inside the quotation marks is plain inaccurate).  

  

I *have* read Terry Winograd and Weizenbaum and Stephen Hawkins. I *have* gone through the writings of Thomas Kuhn, Feyerabend, and Michael Polanyi. These are preeminent philosophers of science who have also sized up fairly well the function, role, and methodologies of science.  

  

There are some people cannot even realise the work and worth of such key authors cited. Sweeping generalisations and nonchalant remarks by these
people do sometimes invite rhetoric, though. If what I had written was "empty rhetoric", I must say that the grace with which Dr. Kalyan has accepted defeat in his ability to write "empty rhetoric" is quite appreciated. Indeed, it is so easy to dismiss anything in just two sentences.

  

All the same, the ones who cannot differentiate between rhetoric and reasoning can only be pitied.

Here is a golden rule to win any argument:

*na bhetavyam, na boddhavyam,  
*

* na s'rAvyam vAdino vacaH \|*

*jhaTiti prativaktavyam*

* sabhAsu vijigIs"ubhiH ! \|\|  
*

*  
*

BTW, the newspaper that I referred to is *The New Indian Express* dated 3rd Feb 2019, Bangalore edition (available over the net), page 20. And those are still enamoured of the White Man may read with benefit Dr. Ananda Coomaraswamy's "Laying Kipling's Ghost".
