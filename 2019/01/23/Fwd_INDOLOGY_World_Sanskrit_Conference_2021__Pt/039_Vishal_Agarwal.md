It might be noted that this same Kamala Visvesvaran (mentioned in CAPEEM press release) had written a Hinduphobic article in a Georgetown Law Journal on the 2005-2006 CA Textbooks controversy with Michael Witzel, another rabid Hindu hater. In that controversy, a very hateful role was played by a 'Munh mein Krishna verses, bagal mein chhuri' type Indologist too who lived in Michigan and now resides in California. Yes, we are often taken in by the apparent scholarship of these Indologists whether westerners by birth or adoption, who spread hatred against Hindus in the name of scholarship.

  

Now K Kalyan had asked for a few names of Indologists who spread hatred against Hinduism in the west. So let me append some articles that I wrote during that 2005-2006 controversy which will give him more names than he needs (See Appendix A of the file IndiaForum2.doc). I can send him many more articles from my archive but these should suffice for the time being. Some scholars on this list might find my language in this email very acerbic - but I prefer to call the spade a spade. If people write verses on Krishna but spread hatred against Hinduism and Hindu kids elsewhere, they do not deserve my respect. My kid deserves to be taught about his heritage with the same respect that kids from other ethnic backgrounds are.

  

In 2007, I had requested the 9th circuit court in S Francisco for a copy of the deposition of some of these Indologists like Michael Witzel and have it digitally with me. That Hindu hater vented out his hatred and racism quite openly during this deposition. I have interacted with many of these Indologists since 1998 and have first hand experience of how prejudiced and petty these people are. May be K Kalyan needs to stop being a Gungadin and see at our tradition through our own eyes, and stop glorifying Sahibs. As for science etc., that is a different matter and I do not wish to flaunt my own degrees like he did on this list earlier.
