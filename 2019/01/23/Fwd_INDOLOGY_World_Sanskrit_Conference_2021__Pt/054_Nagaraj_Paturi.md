Some unmoderated members like Sri Vishal-ji have been sending messages that needed moderation. I apologise for their consequences.

  

All the members making unnecessarily insensitive messages to this forum shall be brought under moderation.

  

I request all members to stop sending messages to this thread.

  

This thread is being immediately closed.

  

Violators will be controlled through appropriate measures.
