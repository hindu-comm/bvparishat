If you look at history of Mankind the USA civilization's life is still very short. Only for 100 years it has been a great civilization. We do not know what will happen in next 100 years. Will it be great after 100 or 200 or 500 years? Indian Civilization was great for 1000s of years and then it has declined. No comparison.

  

You cannot have a short term view of Greatness. Look at the long term.
