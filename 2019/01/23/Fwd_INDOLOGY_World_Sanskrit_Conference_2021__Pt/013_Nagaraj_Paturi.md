--- Great Science and Technology work produced by good universities in US and many other parts of the world and including great universities and institutes of India have not been called garbage by anybody anywhere in the thread.

  

Drawing inferences that can be drawn from the poorvapakshin's statements betrays only the weakness in the prativaada against the chosen poorvapaksha.

  

Primary emphasis of Sri Balasubramanian Ramakrishnan-ji was his disappointment with a growing trend in Indology of showing its subject matter namely India, its literature, culture etc. in poor light.

  

His response to Prof. Prasad 's views about the theme of the next WSC can be a sweeping generalisation and exaggeration because the hundreds of papers of a conference of that scale can not be and should not be expected to be following just this "hating the subject matter of the discipline" trend. Most of the papers there most probably can be expected to be away from this trend and can be expected to be focusing on topics not at all involving either positive or negative judgements about Sanskrit or related topics.

  

But he like any Indian who is being shown in bad light as part of showing the subject matter of the discipline in such light naturally tends to call such misrepresentation of his society and nation including himself using words such as 'garbage' only.

  

He, while talking about this trend as part of a fashion driven tendency digressed into research in the area of S & T and observed rightly or wrongly that the academics in that area too is fashion driven only. He did not call S &T research as garbage.

  

It is not wrong to point out the sweeping generalisations, exaggerations and digressions . But his expression of disappointment with the growing trend in Indology of misrepresenting India can not be sidelined in the process..
