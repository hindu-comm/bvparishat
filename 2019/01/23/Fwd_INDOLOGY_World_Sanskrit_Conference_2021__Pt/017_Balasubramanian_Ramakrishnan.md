My thanks to Prof. Paturi for his explanations. They are all right on target. At the risk of boring BVP members let me give a couple of examples:

  

1\. In the early 90's a new type of "error control code" which is a key feature in 3G/4G/5G networks was introduced. It's also very important in satellite systems. Once people saw how good it was and some key people started working on it, every Tom Dick and Harry started working on it, quite a few with questionable quality. Now it's dying a slow death. A trend following? Yes. But does it detract from the great use of these codes? No.

  

2\. When I was in graduate school, a sure way of not getting a job was doing something in "machine learning". Now it's the "in" thing. Every field is trying to force fit their stuff into this area because that's the fashionable thing to do. The IEEE signal processing society is actually considering changing its name to IEEE big data society! Trend following? Yes, does this mean machine learning is useless? Absolutely no.

  

I am quite frankly surprised with the level of dumb vitaNDAvAdam my simple, obvious statement which should be a \*truism\* to anyone who has any \*worthwhile\* experience to speak of in R&D inside the US,.

  

BTW, quantity also matters and not just quality. The endowment (not the amount it spends per year) of Harvard alone is bigger than the GDP of about 50% of the countries in the world. While not apples-to-apples, this should give an idea of the financial clout these people have.
