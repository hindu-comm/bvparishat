Dear Sri Ramakrishnan,

  

There is nothing to stand up to. India does not have an alternate model.

Reactions don't create model. Scholars back home treasure what is  

produced in the west. Religious people recite verses and maintain their

own regimented beliefs. It is not the fault of the researchers in the west.  

If I was asked to create a record of US history, I would do a still poorer job.

Humans have a tendency to map the world from their perspective.

Possibly animals do. Then India has such poor record keeping.

Low data force people to extrapolate using their own maps. "a person

missing" would be inferred as "person killed". Garbage in glib covers

are spewed out for the world market as we speak.  

  

To create a cultural history of India from an Indian perspective is  

the challenge of the time. RC Majumdar at Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan  

has created eleven volumes. It was a post-independence massive effort.

Some others have created some biased political history.

A group or a university should take up the compilation of

India's cultural history from the first principles aiming to complete

by the centennial of independence. Some Government help and

sponsorship could be necessary.  

  

We operate here to create a message for the new youth. We  

try to create a broad experiential view. Our thrust is to understand

our own personality in art, literature, science and living to be able

to create a definition identifying Indian descent. Some in BVP assist us.

  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra  

  

Best regards,
