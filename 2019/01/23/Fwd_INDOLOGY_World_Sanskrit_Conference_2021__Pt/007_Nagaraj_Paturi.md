" One of the " is very apt. That statement implies the existence of many other one of the most technologically advanced nations on earth. .

  

"The academia here (in the US) can be very fashion driven" is a comment specific to one of those many.

  

So it implies that being one of the most technologically advanced nations on earth is not causally connected either favourably or unfavourably with academia of the nation being fashion driven.

  

India has one of the best cricket teams of the world. That makes cricket one of the most fashionable game in India. Every new technique of the Indian cricket team, why even every new costume of theIndian cricket players becomes a fashion among lower levels of playing of the game. We can not say " if lower levels of playing of cricket is so fashion driven, how can India have one of the best cricket teams of the world ?"
