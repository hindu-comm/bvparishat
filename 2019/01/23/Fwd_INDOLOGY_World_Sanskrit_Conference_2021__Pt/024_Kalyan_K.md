Sri Paturiji  
  
Let me ask you a question. What do you mean by "fashionable"? How can someone take one single example of Prof Doniger and try to generalize it to the entire American academia? Since this thread is about WSC, do you have evidence to show that there is a systemic bias against Hinduism in that forum?  
  
Now whether in science/engineering or in indology, one needs evidence to show that certain trends are emerging or are currently in vogue. The evidence cannot be a single example or a couple of examples. Perceptions cannot become evidence. (People who claim to work in Statistics should know this better). And one should not go merely by acquired "truisms" or sensationalized news paper reports. Sweeping generalizations like "every one is doing it right now irrespective of whether it is correct/incorrect required/not required", does a great disservice to the academia, industry and whatnot. It paints a whole bunch of people as brainless sheep trying to follow a shepherd.  
  
Actually, even before answering all these questions, one must define what constitutes bias against Hinduism. And this can be subjective. I will take an example. Prof Pollock talks about Rama's "madness" in the Aranya kanda. The use of the word "mad" for a revered figure might offend someone, but it might not offend someone else. Does the use of this word automatically imply that Prof Pollock is anti-hindu? Or is there a good reason why he chooses to use this word. Without dispassionate analysis, we cannot come to any conclusions. It is easy to appeal to base emotions, but that is not the correct way to determine the state of things.
