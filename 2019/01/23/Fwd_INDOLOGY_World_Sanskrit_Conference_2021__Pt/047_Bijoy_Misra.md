Dear Vishal, friends, and the moderators,  

I would request all to leave political or personal views

off the list. Let us maintain BVP as a scholar's

forum. We read Valmiki and not examine him  

through his personal life. The latter is a social  

condition, knowledge is a skill.  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
