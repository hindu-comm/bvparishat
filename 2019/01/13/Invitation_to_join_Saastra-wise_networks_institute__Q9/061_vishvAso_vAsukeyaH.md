नमस्काराः।

Inspired by <https://www.partnersintorah.org/#how-it-works> a few friends and I thought of developing a support system which fosters 1:1 student-mentor relationship mediated and established by "relationship managers". If this Indic network initiative seriously study their system and replicate it for hindus - that will be most delightful.  
  
As it is I am unclear about how these networks will operate and help a student in a given field of study.
