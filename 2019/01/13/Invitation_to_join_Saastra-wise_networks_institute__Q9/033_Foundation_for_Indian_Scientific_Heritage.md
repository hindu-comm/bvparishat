Namaste,

  

Among the established Shastra-Traditions the Shanmatha - Shaiva-Vaishnava-Shakta-Ganapathya-Soura-Koumara do have their Agama/Tantra Sampradaya-Parampara. Kashmir Trika, Kerala-Bengal-Kashmir Tantra traditions - all these come under the same broad category of Agama/Tantra. Such that it would be in the fitness of things to consider one platform for all these specific disciplines.

  

Warm Regards.

  

Dr S Ramakrishna Sharma.
