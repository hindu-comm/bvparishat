I think SamkhyaYoga may be a group as Samkhya provide theoretical foundation for Yogic process of Patanjaji.

One Yoga-Tantra group with subgroup of Kashmir Saivism and SamkhyaYoga etc.

As these two can be considered complementary systems with possible
synthesis (subject to validation)as I have proposed in my thesis.
