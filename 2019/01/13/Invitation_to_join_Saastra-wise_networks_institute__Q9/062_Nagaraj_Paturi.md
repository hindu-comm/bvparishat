\> As it is I am unclear about how these networks will operate and help a student in a given field of study.

  

---- Currently this is not a student oriented program.

  

\>I thought of developing a support system which fosters 1:1 student-mentor relationship mediated and established by "relationship managers".

  

--------- Great suggestion. This can be one of the ways these networks be leveraged.

  

But currently the networks have the following objectives:

  

1. to provide platforms for scholars of variouss'aastras such as Meemaamsaa, Nyaaya, VyaakaraNa, Vedaanta etc. to meet other scholars in thes'aastraof their pursuit /expertise for

          

-    exchange of ideas, discussions, debates, -    for learning from each other, -    for inspiration and emulation, for collaborations, -    for collective generation ofknowledge, -    for collective facing of detractors of either individual scholars
    or thes'aastraor thes'aastric tradition etc.  

  

2. The network connects traditional scholars of each of theses'aastras

  

-   among themselves
-   and with theuniversityand research institute scholars specialising
    in thats'aastra
-   and with scholars of Vaidika gurukulas run by governmental and
    non-governmental organisations, -   traditional Vaidika gurukulas of grihagurukula and other types,
-   and scholars pursuing or commanding thes'aastras while being in
    various careers such as school teacher, college teacher, various
    government, corporate or other private jobs of various kinds or
    just some traditional occupation such as a farmer, -   in short any scholar pursuing or commanding thes'aastrain India
    or abroad.

  

We shall certainly keep this suggestion of developing a support system which fosters 1:1 student-mentor relationship mediated and established by "relationship managers" while developing various activities of the networks.

  

Thanks and regards.
