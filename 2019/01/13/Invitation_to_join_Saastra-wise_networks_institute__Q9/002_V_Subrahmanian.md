A very nice initiative indeed that will be beneficial to many.

  

A network for the study/research of Mahabharatha, Ramayana and the Puranas will be useful to many who are interested/involved in this study.

  

A network for Sahitya too will do a lot of good for scholars, researchers, students, etc.

  

Kindly specify the method of enrolling in the networks that one is interested in.

  

warm regards
