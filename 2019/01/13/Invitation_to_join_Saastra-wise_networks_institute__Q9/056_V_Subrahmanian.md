I have filled the form. Kindly include my name in the network for Vedanta (Advaita) and the Mahabharata, etc. group if it is instituted.

  

I am not sure of the real structure of the network initiative. Will all the networks be made known to all people? If this isthe case, then even if one is in a particular network, when he gets questions from others or himself pertaining to other network/s, he should be able to interact with scholars of those faculties. I think this kind of accessibility will be ideal.

  

Thanks andregards
