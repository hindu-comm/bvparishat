Let me take this opportunity to provide the following clarifications:

  

1\. These networks are not email lists nor are they electronic networks such as social networks. These are associations among specialist scholars in each s'aastra.

  

2. Many traditional scholars who don't use emails or WhatsApps etc. can be members of these networks. Meetings among network members can be physical meetings.

  

3. All members are informed names of all other members of their network and names of members of other networks.

  

4\. These networks are just facilitated by Inter-University Centre for Indic Knowledge Systems. But are run by the member-scholars themselves.
