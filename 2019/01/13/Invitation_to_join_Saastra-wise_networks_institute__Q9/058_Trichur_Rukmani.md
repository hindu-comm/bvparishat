I just saw this and I am so happy to note that there is a growing interest in śāstra studies. I would very much like to be part of the Sāṁkhya Yoga group. Though I have done some research in advaita I cannot claim any expertise in it. However I would very much like to be a part of that group as well so that can further my knowledge in advaita.

Thank you
