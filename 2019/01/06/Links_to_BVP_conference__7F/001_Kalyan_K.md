Paturi Sir  
  
Please see if you are able to bring out a book with the proceedings of the conference. The soft copy of the book can be sold in Amazon, Google books etc. I am interested in topics dealing with indology, darshanas, Mahabharata, Ramayana. If there are too many papers, the proceedings can be split based on the topics.  
  
Regards  
Kalyan
