Scholarship apart, shrI PV kANe's conservativism focused on understanding the intent and essence of the dharmashAstra-s, and applying them in the modern context. In contrast, folks such as mideval nibandhanakRt-s focused on following the "letter" of the dharma to the greatest extand possible without necessarily the same strong focus on the presumed essence. So, per say, the words "did not necessarily believe in those works" is a tad misleading. Indeed it is the sorry person who puts in such effort (despite health problems) merely for silly glory. One need only read the chapter linked below to see where he's coming from.  
  
Indeed, PV kANe's focus (which immediately reminds one of his fellow chitpAvan-s - Tilak or even sAvarkar) on the essence is exactly what is expected of a practicing scholar - where one finds the rare combination of bold unprejudiced evaluation of evidence with an unequivocal commitment and respect for the views and ways of the sages. This is in stark contrast with many contributors to this list (as evidenced in several threads).  

  

As such, shrI shivasenAni's surmise of PV kANe's views are correct in essence if not in some minor details. While admiring his dedication to the sages and boldness, I don't agree fully with PV kANe's recommendations below (particularly given the differences in our temporal contexts), but reproduce relevant details:  

  

तत्त्वनिष्ठ-परिवर्तनवादि-परिषत् / धर्मनिर्णयमण्डलम् (1930-60) under the guidance of the learned kevalAnanda-sarasvatI (of Wai, Satara, MH), including eminent scholars like PV kANe, shrIdharashAstrI pAThaka/ shankarAnanda-bhAratI, sadAshivashAstrI bhiDe, DaftarI, JS karanDikar, prajnEneshvarayatI etc.. ([HDh5](https://archive.org/stream/HistoryOfDharmasastraancientAndMediaevalReligiousAndCivilLawV.5.2/Kane_A-History-of-Dharmasastra-v5-2_1962#page/n1029/mode/2up)) attempted to:

-   prepare simple model prayoga-s (sandhyA, sAmudAyika prayers,
    upanayana etc..).
    -   This included the “hindUkaraNavidhi”, which involved a return to
        hinduism -   widening of adhikAra-s and removal of outdated prohibitions
    -   shUdra-s to receive the veda-s
    -   removing the idea of pollution by shadow or touch
        (untouchability)
    -   removing sa-gotra marriage restrictions, while keeping sa-piNDa
        restriction.
    -   recasting saha-pankti-bhojanam to only account for vegetarianism
