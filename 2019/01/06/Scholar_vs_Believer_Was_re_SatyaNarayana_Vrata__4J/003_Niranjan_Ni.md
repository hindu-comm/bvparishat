Dear Sir,

  

Thank you for the clarification. Frequently descendants do transfer the burden of authority and claim authority from "authoritative" sources in order to accomplish prayogas dissapproved in shastra.

  

I will give you an example: A certain descendant of Lahiri Mahasaya the famous yogi has been distorting his own great grandfather's teachings in the name of spreading kriya yoga. This seems to be a frequent fault of people with insufficient strength of character.

  

We must give such claims the benefit of the doubt (for the purported view of the ancestor) until something in their direct writings bears out such an agenda driven mind. My 2 cents.

  

Thanks,

  

Niranjan
