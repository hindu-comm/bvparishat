That sagotra marriages were okay was not the view of the descendant; it was the view of MM P V Kane, as reported by the descendant. Regarding other incidents, MM Kane was a member of committees formed by Govt. of India, with a reformist agenda, but I have not gone through the works of these committees.

  

I have not heard the other story about Dasaratha and Kausalya being from the same gotra.
