Dear Shri Sivasenani Noriji,

  

I admit I am a novice in this subject matter, but isn't foisting the fault of the descendant on his ancestor wrong in principle? After all even Sri Krishna had a son in Samba who was far from satisfactory. What then to say of fallible mortals? Maybe you have other reasons for Shri MM PV Kane ji being reckoned as more European in leanings than Indian in spirit, but the conclusion does not segue from the predicated "incident".

  

On the subject of sagotra marriages, I have read a version where Chakravarti Dasharatha and Kaushalya were sagotra and hence their first born Shanta Devi was deformed - apparently this deformity vanished after she was given in "sveekaara" to King Romapada.

  

Can I have your thoughts on this please?

  

Thanks.
