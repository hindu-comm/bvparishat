MM P V Kane was a great scholar, without any doubt but that does not make him a gold standard for practitioners of the faith, like say Dharmasindhukaara is. I worked with a descendant of the great scholar and was shocked to know that when the question of sagotra marriage had to be settled in the family, he opined that being from the same gotra does not matter and that the marriage should go on. Admittedly, I don't know the full context but the descendant was quite approving of the whole thing. So MM P V Kane was indeed a great scholar, who summarised more than 900 works on Dharma Sastra but did not necessarily believe in those works. He was nearer to the European scholars in spirit than to the Nibandhakrits, though his monumental work itself ought to qualify as a Nibandha.
