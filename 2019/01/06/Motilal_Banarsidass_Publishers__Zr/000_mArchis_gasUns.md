Namaste,

  

 I'm eager to publish a small (under 30 pages) book, a reprint on Sanskrit Sandhi in India (because in English it would not make much sense in Russia).

Is there someone who knows an editor fromMotilal Banarsidass Publishers or any other place where one would be interested printing at least 300-500 copies?

  

Marcis
