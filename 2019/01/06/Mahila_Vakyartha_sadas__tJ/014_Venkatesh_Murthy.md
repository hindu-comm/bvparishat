Namaste

  

Vedic chanting is restricted by Dharma Shastra rules. If we want we can break or bend the rules. No God or court will question us. But the rule is nobody without undergoing Upanayana should chant Vedas. It is not about being a man or woman. And a Patita person like not doing Sandhyavandana for a long time, being in impure state like Asoucha because of death or birth in family or having vices should not chant also.
