Respected scholars,

  

I thank the entire galaxy of scholars on this list and also those who were personally available when the MahilA VAkyArtha Sadas happened, for their heartfelt blessings and words of encouragement.  

To be frank, my entry into a serious learning of sanskrit and shAstras happened only when I joined for MA VyAkaraNa at Sree Sankaracharya Universsity of Sanskrit, Kalady, in 2017. I was immensely fortunate to study under Prof Ch Satyanarana Sastry, who, seeing my zeal in the subject, took out much of his non-office hours, on weekdays and weekends to teach me various portions from the SiddhAnta Kaumudi, Sekharas, LaghumanjushA and BhUshanasAra. I must confess that he was the one who motivated and trained each and every interested student to take part in Vakyarthas that happen in every nook and corner of Kerala, and still does so. In this context, it should be highlighted that students and scholars from all communities, men and women, who are well versed in their respective shAstras participate in such shAstra sabhas. Thus it happened that, upon coming to know of a VAkyArtha to be organized at the BVP conference, I contacted Prof Pandurangi, and the rest followed.

  

From 2016, I also started studying from Prof Korada Subrahmaniam, whose versatility in all the 14 Vidyasthanas is unparalleled, due to which I have a clear basic idea of Nyaya, Mimamsa, Vedanta, and Dharmashastras, apart from VyAkaraNa. I offer all the credits of where I stand now, unto him.

  

At present, I am pursuing research towards a PhD under the supervision of Prof JSR Prasad, and co-supervision of Prof Korada Subrahmanyam.  

  

Thanks and regards,

Mridula Aswin,
