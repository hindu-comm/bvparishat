Madam, Namaste.  

I feel all the more responsible and duty-bound towards the cause of Sanskrit and ShAstras, by receiving adulation from such eminent scholars as you. Thank you so much, although I must admit, that the students of Maitreyee Gurukulam, who quoted many Vedic sUktas and mantras during the course of their vAkyArtha, and another Navya NyAya scholar sitting right next to the adhyakshA on her left in the sabhA, whose fluency in the Navya NyAya terminologies was awe-inspiring, deserve wider recognition than me.  

  

Regards,

  

Mridula Aswin,

Department of Sanskrit studies,

University of Hyderabad.
