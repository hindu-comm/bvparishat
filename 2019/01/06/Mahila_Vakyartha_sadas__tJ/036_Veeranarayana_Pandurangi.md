Vakyartha was announced in the brochure of Bvp conference. Then mridula Ashwin approached me that she would like to participate in it. Then we collected others too and organised it.

  

Before that KSU had organised one more Mahila vakyartha sadas in Bengaluru November 2014. There too Vijayalaskhmi Bhat was the chairperson, Sangeeta Ramesh too participated.

I really welcome others too for future events. Perhaps we may look forward in Indic academy network too.
