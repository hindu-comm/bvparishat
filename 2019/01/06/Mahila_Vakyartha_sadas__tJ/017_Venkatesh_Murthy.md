Sir,

  

My intention is to point out with Veda chanting we have to be careful. Other things like speaking Sanskrit and discussions can take place by everybody. It is nice to encourage everybody. With no Upanayana Samskara and no Guru Upadesha how can some person chant Vedas? That is why Veda Vyasa made Puranas and Geeta. It for benefiting people even with no Upanayana Samskara. They can also get the SAME benefit like a person studying Vedas. They will not get anything less.

  

All three Acharyas Sankara, Ramanuja and Madhva have said the same thing about Vedic study in Brahma Sutras Bhashyas.
