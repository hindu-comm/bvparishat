Sir,  

Namaste. I happen to be staying close-by. I first attended one of his workshops at Sanskrit university, Kalady, and awestruck by his vidwat and agility in traversing multiple shAstras simultaneously, felt that I should become his student immediately.  

  

Regards,

  

Mridula Aswin,

Dept. of Sanskrit studies,

University of Hyderabad.
