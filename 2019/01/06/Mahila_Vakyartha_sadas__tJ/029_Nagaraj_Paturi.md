Aayushmati,

  

I am travelling. Could not quickly respond. The Mahila Vakyartha sadas was not planned in advance. That is why it was not announced in advance. That is why Mridula wanted to participate in a men's vaakyaartha only. But when we found more women available, we organised the all women one.

  

I know that you would have loved to take part in the all women vaakyaartha sadas. You are one of the finest vyaakarana scholars of this young generation.

  

Let us have more of these. We will look forward to your participation next time.
