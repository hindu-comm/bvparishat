Sir,

  

It is perfectly fine to share your observations. I think, you responded in particular to Madam Saroja Bhate ji's remark on a woman scholar reciting a Veda sukta, in a sadas, firstly from Pune in '62.

  

There is much more to motivate, achieve and establish in connection with women scholars participating in sabhas/shastradhyayana. The current thread is pointer in that direction.

  

Hence, you are requested to port your views to a new thread for churning the same.
