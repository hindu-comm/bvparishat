Amazing videos, Nagaraj Ji. Thanks for sharing. Certainly during my student days in Pune, women were among the leading young scholars of Sanskrit, several of them were senior to me by a few years, and many were my contemporaries. Many ladies from the University of Pune won at the Sanskrit debate competitions in Ujjain and elsewhere. Glad to see this rising generation of Women Sanskrit scholars today. With best regards,
