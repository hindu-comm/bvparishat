It is indeed heartening to see this and wide publicity needs to be given to this. Maybe this can be worked out as an article and published in the Hindu or any reputed Newspaper to counteract the misconceptions of people like Ananya Vajpeyi. Since Ananya did write some derogatory remarks in the Hindu that would be the appropriate forum according to me; Jayaraman why don't you think about it since you were very much present at this venue.
