Kum Sangeetha Ramesh, seated next to the adhyakshaa on her left, teaches in KSU. I spoke to her and she told me that she has been teaching various subjects there, but not formally appointed as a regular faculty yet. She had come to Udupi with her sister and the latter's child. Sangeetha was clad in Madhva style kacche sari. She told me there is some subtle difference in the way it is worn by married and unmarried women.  
  

If I remember correctly, she spoke on ten types of shaabda bodha.
