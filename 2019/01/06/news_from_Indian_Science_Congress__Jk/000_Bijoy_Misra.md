Friends,

Here is a news item today.

<https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ravanas-airports-modi-waves-leave-science-congress-stunned/articleshow/67402208.cms?fbclid=IwAR2EqZ6EzX9_UtM-gIWmWQu4aPB1zlCU0UFq3YmWH_MXjg217KfoXCR5Kcg>

I do notice occasional posting here on some of these unanalyzed ideas.

India had real scientific contributions in number theory, cognitive science,

music and speech. I hope people would make study groups to understand

deeper than operating on slogan politics. I believe it has to do with incomplete

or no study of the text. Sometimes literal translations create blunders.  

BVP itself may have a role to play in analytic investigations.

People may respond if anyone attended the latest Indian Science Congress.

Best regards,

BM.
