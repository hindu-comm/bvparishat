Dear Shri Venkataji,

  

Such instances were common in the last century, and the great souls could understand and experience these incidents because of the kind of severe tapashcharyaa which they had.Now.a.days,such people are in microscopic minority and most of the people or public does not possess that kind of aatmika bala or a which one can gain with saadhanaa.

  

Thanks for this piece of information,experienced in the recent past.  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
