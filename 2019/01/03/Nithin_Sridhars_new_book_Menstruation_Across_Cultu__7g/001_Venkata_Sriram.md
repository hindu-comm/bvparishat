My best wishes to Nithin especially when he brought forth during the current times when it is being questioned as a social taboo and stigma.

  

I remember once my spiritual mentor was saying about his acharya. In those days, the vedanta classes were taken in 'protected environment' and to a 'select few' who were found to be eligible by the acharyas unlike today which are taught via skype / online classes and acharya is 'forced to align himself' with the wants & whims of sishya.

  

Once, my teacher's acharya was taking vedanta pATha and accidentally a maid servant passed by the way through a corridor and the he glanced at her. He had an unusual burning sensation all over his body and had to take head bath and performed achamana. When the group of few disciples who were present there asked what had happened and the reason for taking bath and answer from that great teacher was that he happened to glance at the maid servant during vedanta class and that maid was in her 4th day of menstrual cycle. That glance had sent a sense of burning sensation all over his body.

  

The great teacher was none other than Brahmasri (M.M) Maddulapalli Manikya Sastry Garu ....

  

This is what is called "ashaucha" which hardly only a handful can feel with their 'upAsana-bala'.

  

rgs,

sriram
