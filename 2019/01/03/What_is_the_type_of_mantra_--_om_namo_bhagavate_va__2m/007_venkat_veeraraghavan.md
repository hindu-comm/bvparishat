I'd like to weigh in on 2 points:

  

1\. Tantra means technique...In all those passages you have quoted it is used in this context and even where mentioned as a path, it is used in this context as practical application of a mantra. Tantra is basically purification of the 5 elements (bhutashuddhi) and expansion of consciousness. This very end is achieved in the Vedas purely with mantras such as the aghamarshana sukta, marjana, achamana etc....

Tantra deals with instructions received directly from the Guru and is never committed to text as a rule. Although many astra mantras can be found in the Veda proper, the technique or Tantra for prayoga involved bhutashuddhi, nyasa and employment ....

If you think about it, what IS the use of a mantra if NOT for employment?

  

2\. Mudras are not new / unknown territory to Vedic mantras...the most well known Vedic mantra the Gayatri has 24 mudras and its own yantra mentioned in prayoga shastra.
