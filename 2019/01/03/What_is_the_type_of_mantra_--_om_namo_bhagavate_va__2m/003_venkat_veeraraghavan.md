I am not sure what you mean by a shruti mantra. But this mantra is atleast as old as Dhruva's epoch since he was initiated by Narada in the Dvadashakshari.

  

Many people like to split their hairs trying to separate the Veda from tantra, but it is my practical experience (belief?) that they are inseparable.

  

Tantrika-Shruti-Pauranic is a western lens of looking at Indian traditions...that seeks to forcefit the unknown into a western world-view. It does not work like that in reality. Considering the fact that 90% of our Veda shakhas have disappeared, much has been lost in terms of theory, practice and usage.

  

The best way of using a mantra is to practice it instead of analysing it threadbare. The Mantrashakti reveals its true svarupa to one who devotes Himself/Herself to the mantra and its Deity. It is said that just 7 days of continuous practice can open the realm of the siddhas to the upasaka.
