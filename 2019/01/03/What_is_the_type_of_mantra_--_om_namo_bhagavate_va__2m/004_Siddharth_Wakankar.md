Dear Venkata ji,

  

You are absolutely right.

  

The effects of Mantras etc.are to be experienced by saadhanaa and not to be discussed openly.

  

 Moreover,you get the results only when you have unflinching faith in it,because,only shraddha can work wonders and no discussions.  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
