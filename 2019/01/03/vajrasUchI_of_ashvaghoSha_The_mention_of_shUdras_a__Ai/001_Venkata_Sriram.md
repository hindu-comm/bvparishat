Namaste,

  

In Telangana & Andhra, there are two communities namely nAyI-brAhmaNa and vishwa-brAhmaNa. The barbers belong to former and goldsmiths belong to later and both fall under the category of BC.

  

Interestingly, both have upanayana ceremonies and conduct before marriages. I don't know from where this originated. Probably, Nagaraju garu may throw light on this as he is from folklore background.

  

rgs,

sriram
