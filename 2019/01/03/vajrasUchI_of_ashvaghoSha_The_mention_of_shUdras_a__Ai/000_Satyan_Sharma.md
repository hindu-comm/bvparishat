Namaskara

  

I came across a text titled Vajrasūcī, attributed to Aśvaghoṣa (50 BCE - 50 CE). The text discusses the question of 'who is a Brahmin'. It obviously criticises idea of being a Brahmin by birth. Then after a point it analyses the idea of 'being a Brahmin due to knowledge'. Here, there come passing references of Śūdras who are scholars of Vedas, Vyākaraṇa, and other philosophies, who aren't considered Brahmins (दृश्यन्ते च क्वचित् शूद्रा अपि वेदव्याकरणमीमांसासांख्यवैशेषिकलग्नाजीवकादिसर्वशास्त्रविदः। न च ते ब्राह्मणाः स्युः।). Then, he mentions Śūdras who perform Yajñas for themselves and for others, who also teach (दृश्यन्ते हि क्षत्रियवैश्यशूद्रा यजनयाजनाध्यापनदानप्रतिग्रहप्रसङ्गविविधानि कर्माणि कुर्वन्तो न च ते ब्राह्मणा भवतां सम्मताः।).

  

As the age for the Upanayana-saṃskāra of Śūdras isn't mentioned in Dharmasūtras and Smṛtis (at least some of them), which may be understood as some law which prohibits Śūdras from being educated in Śāstras, I'd like to know the opinion of scholars about the aforementioned references.
