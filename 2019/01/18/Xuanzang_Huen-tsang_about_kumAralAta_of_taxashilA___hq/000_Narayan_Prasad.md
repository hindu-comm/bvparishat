Dear Scholars,  

Namaste.

In my article published in1998 under the title “कातन्त्रस्य शार्ववर्मिक व्याख्यानम्”, I just mentioned in passing the article “Kātantra und Kaumāralāta” (in German) published by Dr Heinrich Lüders in Philologica Indica, 1940, pp.659-721. From this article I also translated into English a passage of the German text, pp.677-678, directly related to Kātantra.

In the Hindi (and Sanskrit) world very few people are aware of the Kaumāralāta grammar. In English, only one-page introduction about this grammar is found in “Hermut Scharfe (1977): Grammatical Literature”, p.162.

The recent publication of the article “Xuanzang about Avalokiteśvara, Jibin and Madhyāntika”, by Prof. Charles Willemen in ABORI, Vol.XCIV, 2013, published in 2017, pp.111-123, excited great interest in me, when I came across his following statement (p.112):

“Ever since Li Rongxi’s translation of Xuanzang’s … ***Record of the Western Regions of the Great Tang*** (646-648 AD), many scholars have benefitted greatly from this work. Here, I want to take a closer look at Xuanzang’s text fascicle III, where I find his notes … … on Kumāralāta of Takṣaśilā.”

I came to know for the first time that Kumāralāta was from Takṣaśilā.

Later, at p.121 of the above-mentioned article, Prof Willemen gives improved translation of Xuanzang’s original Chinese text “昔經部拘摩羅邏多(唐言童受)論師。 於此製述諸論” as follows:

“Formerly the śāstra-master Kumāralāta (Thongshou in Chinese), of the Sautrāntika school, composed his śāstras here.”

Immediately after this he writes: “Kumāralāta, … the *or* a basic master of Sautrantikas, may have lived ca. 150 AD.”

In the above Chinese text, Prof. Willemen has interpreted the Chinese term 拘摩羅邏多 “Ku-mo-lo-lo-to” (in pinyin transliteration, “jū-mó-luó-luó-duō”) as “Kumāralāta”, whereas both Julien Stanislas (1857:154) and Samuel Beal (1884:139) in their translations interpreted it as “**Kumāralabdha**”. The relevant portions of their translations are appended herewith.
