Namaste



1. As the topic of RESEARCH -SCIENCE - SAMSKRUTH is receiving attention in the recent posts, I thought of sharing the following excerpt from a discussion on another top profile science discussion group. I am attaching the two cited papers for readers convenience and reference. 



2. When Prof. Korada is quoting Shaastra , it needs to be taken in right spirit and explored.



3. Coming specific to the debate on pronouncing ' anuswara' debate, it is to be noted that the ' Paninian Anuswara is NOT the
'M' phoneme of roman alphabet which has a part 'swara' preceding its pronunciation and yields only halant sound and different model of lip movement, the internal effort and memory - pattern. 



 If Paninian ' anuswara by rule ' monuswarah' is plausibly yielding a different anuswara than what is intended by
Pratishaakhya ( for use in Vedas), yes it is.

The Vedic Anuswara is a part of ' Sukta - Mantra-Darshana'. The 'Bhashaa- anuswaara' is a human effort to articulate a phoneme. 



The anuswara of Samskrutham in Paninian Bhashaa - Sandhi context is also a human effort and conscious pronunciation ( Paurusheya -Prayatna). 

The properties of ' anuswara yield from 'na' (नश्चापदान्तस्य झलि ) is not necessarily the same as the anuswaara yield from the ' ma' (मो’नुस्वारः ) .



 One may also observe that ' anuswara' in ' Tantra' is an anushaasana for proper mantra pronunciation. 



All this is just to help understand the importance of points in Prof. Koradas post reading : \< The question is untenable -- how can a शास्त्रम् tell how to pronounce ? Pronunciation has to

be learnt from a गुरु thru direct interaction . If one learns वेद from a गुरु , then he does not mispronounce . There is अविच्छिन्नगुरुशिष्यपरम्परा -- how would one mispronounce ?

**अनुभवश्च प्रमाणम्** -- ब्रह्मसूत्रशांकरभाष्यम् । Sometimes logic would answer the question -- **शास्त्रम् does not say everything so clearly** -- just check with these सूत्रs --

मो’नुस्वारः ,नश्चापदान्तस्य झलि --- ’ उपूपध्मानीयानाम् ओष्ठौ ’ -- for मकार , ओष्ठौ are the place of articulation . For नकार also अनुस्वार , as per the second सूत्रम् above .

**म्लेच्छनम् , due to the influence of other languages like English and absence of वेदाध्ययनम् for a long period are causing such problems .
**One should study both , वेद and शास्त्र - as much as possible . If one wants good / perfect उच्चारणा , the only way is to approach a गुरु । \>.

This, in essence is the force of the statement : Shikshaa ( as
aVedanga) is the basis of Vyakarana (Vedanga). This stand of Paninian school is inherently, consistently and continuously present in both Bhattoji and Kashikaa schools. Both schools endorse learning ' Samskrutha Vyakarana' as ' Shaastra' , a ' Vednaga' and ' Vak-yoga- anushaasanam for Shabda-Brahma jinyasaa'. 







The point intended to make, especially for those researchers quoting Science as touch stone proof to validate every bit of tradition (more so in the Yoga, Astronomy, Ayur-Veda, Medicine, Archeology, Indology,
History dating and the like ) is this: '



आधुनिक विज्ञानं नूतनं यन्त्राधारितं इत्येव न साधु सर्वं,

शास्त्रं सर्वं प्राचीनमिति व्यासमुखोद्गीतमिति प्रथया न च अनवद्यं ।

सन्तः परीक्ष्य पुरुषार्थप्रदं सर्वं मान्यं मन्यन्ते , विनियोग-परीक्षितं प्रमाणितं च ॥

मूढः वार्ता-प्रथा-कथाप्रत्यय-नेय बुद्धिः ॥



*Excerpt from the discussions in another Science Group* ( dedicated for Consciousness Research Studies):



The scientific establishment surely needs a major overhaul. Hope someone addresses the problem soon, before it gets too rotten to be cured. Publication of false data and results is one aspect. Another is widespread exploitation of PhD students, especially in experimental areas. Its worse than India's caste system!
