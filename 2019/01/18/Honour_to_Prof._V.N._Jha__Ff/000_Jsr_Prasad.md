Dear members,

  

One of the most eminent Naiyayikas of our nation, respected Prof. V.N. Jha ji has been honoured with 'Swami Vivekananda Memorial Award' conferred upon him by the University of Calcutta, recently. His teaching style is quite simple and highly attractive. No need to say that he is an active member of our forum.

  

May he be conferred with more such awards for his valuable contributions to Indian philosophy.

Humble pranams and hearty congratulations to him.  

  

Best regards,

Prasad

Dear Friends,

  

I would like to share with you a really memorable photograph of our respected Guru Prof.V.N.Jha receiving the Swami Vivekananda Memorial Award (2019) from the Chief Minister of West Bengal Smt.Mamata Banerjee yesterday during the convocation function of Calcutta University at Kolkata.

  

Blessed indeed we are to be the students of such an Aacharya.

  

With Regards,

Ananth T.N.
