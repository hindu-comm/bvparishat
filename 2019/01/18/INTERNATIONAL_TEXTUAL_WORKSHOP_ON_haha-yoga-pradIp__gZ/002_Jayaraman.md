A similar seminar on Hathayogapradeepika with focus on Asanas was conducted during August 2017. The results of the same was presented as a paper in the World Sanskrit Conference held at Vancouver last year July. The title of the paper - **Imparting Yoga Texts In Sanskrit - A Teaching Experiment and its outcome**. The full paper is being finalized for being dispatched for inclusion in the WSC proceedings.**The abstract** of the paper is given below which gives an idea about the approach of this teaching experiment which aims to bring about a tradition of teaching Yoga texts through Sanskrit.

---------------------------------------------  

Currently, Yoga texts in Sanskrit language are taught through the medium of other languages, worldwide. Scholars and teachers would agree that knowledge of Sanskrit is essential for better appreciation of Yogic wisdom.  
In such a situation, can an attempt be made to teach Yoga texts, with maximum possible usage of Sanskrit, without getting into nitty-gritty of Sanskrit grammar, even for a learner without Sanskrit background, in a time-bound manner?  
A two day international workshop on Haṭhayogapradīpikā was organized in Krishnamacharya Yoga Mandiram in August 2017 to attempt an answer to the above proposition. There were 97 registered participants in the workshop (India (89) and other countries (8)).  
This paper, which is about this experiment, is in two parts – a) the description of the teaching experiment and b) its outcome as revealed by the analysis of the written feedback forms.  
Part A. Thirty four Sanskrit verses belonging to the first chapter of Haṭhayogapradīpikā on fifteen āsanas formed workshop content. At the outset, core words in these verses that had been identified and categorized earlier were practiced interactively. With this syntactical basis, verses were analyzed and paraphrased. The verses were chanted, to increase textual familiarity. Participants saw ‘text in action’ with the demonstration of the āsanas as per the text.  
Part B. Seventy nine participants offered their inputs through structured feedback forms containing qualitative (descriptive) and quantitative responses. Apart from encouraging response to this workshop, analysis of the descriptive responses offers useful insights and themes for further exploration regarding utilizing Sanskrit in Yoga textual teaching.  
The paper concludes that, in an era where knowledge of Sanskrit and study of Yoga texts seem like islands apart, experiments such as this should be attempted to bridge this gap and also to arrive at methods leading to an immersive teaching learning experience of Yoga texts.
