I am wondering if there are any publications that provide a record of Indic vocabulary in Persian, Aramaic, Bactrian and Greek records that give us a linguistic snapshot of the period around Pāṇini. He is believed to be contemporary with the pre-Mauryan Nanda dynasty and so belonging to a period prior to the invasions by Alexander. Any information would be greatly appreciated. With bestregards,
