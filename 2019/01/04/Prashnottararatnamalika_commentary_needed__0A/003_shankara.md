Namaste,

  

A commentary named 'Balavabodha' is mentioned in Peter Petersons's 6th Search Report of Sanskrit MSS in Bombay Circle, page 83, entry 286.

This manuscript was purchased by him for GOI, but we are not sure whether it is preserved in India or abroad at present. New Catalogus Catalogorum too doesn't provide any more details.  

  

regards  
shankara
