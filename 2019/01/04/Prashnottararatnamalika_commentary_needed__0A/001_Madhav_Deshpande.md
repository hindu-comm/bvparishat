Dear Shashi Ji,

  

  During my recent visit to Leiden University in Netherlands, I came to know that some colleagues there are working on a comparative study/edition of Praśnottararatnamālikā, which is evidently found in Jain and Buddhist versions as well. The Jain version is in Prakrit, and Buddhist version has been translated into Tibetan. Hopefully, this interesting research will be published when completed. With best wishes,
