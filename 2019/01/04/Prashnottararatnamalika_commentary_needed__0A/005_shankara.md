Namaste,

  

There is Jaina version of Prasnottara Ratnamala with a detailed Sanskrit commentary by Devendrasuri at Jain E-library - <https://jainelibrary.org/book-detail/?srno=600185>

  

The text and order of verses in the Jaina version is different here and there from the text attributed to Sankaracharya.  

  

There is also an article on authorship of Prasnottararatnamala - 'Prasnottara Ratnamala Ka Karta' by Lalchand B Gandhi (attached to this mail).  

  

regards  
shankara
