Thank you all.

  

It is difficult to join a traditional Guru for Upanishads now. I am from Bangalore I got to know that in Vidyapeetha they held Pravachanas on Upanishads/Vedas. I dont know the entry criteria there also I am not sure if it is lectures in kannada or recital in original Sanskrit. I am looking for recorded recitals, CD/DVD/Podcast that retains the intonations (not modern fusion of Shlokas and western music). I want to listen to them as I travel in my car/cab (I hope it does not offend people who want it to be listened in a more sacrosanct manner, if it offends I apologise, I dont find a better free time to listen to them alone).

  

Regards,

Harsha
