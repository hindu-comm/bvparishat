Hello Scholars,

  

If I want to know the pronunciations of swaras - udatta, anudatta and swarita in a upanishad shloka, is there any website that can help? Also if I want to purchase the recitals of vedas and upanisads with correct intonations what should I purchase and where would it be available...

  

I think the recitals in "upanishad ganga", "Chanakya" and Nasadiya in "Bharath Ek Khoj" are correct. Can somebody please confirm?

  

Regards,

Harsha
