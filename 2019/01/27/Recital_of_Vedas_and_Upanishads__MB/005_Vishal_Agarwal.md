The Brihadaranyaka in both recessions, Aitareya and Maitrayani are still chanted with accents. A neighbor of mine chants Yajnavalkya Kanda in Madhyandina shakha with the usual Bhaashika svara. I have a scan of a manuscript of the entire Kaushitaki Aranyaka with accents, and a recording of entire Brahmana with accents by a Naagara Brahmana recorded by Rashtriya Veda Vidya Pratishthan. The recent editions of RK Mission Mantrapushpam book have added accents to other Upanishads like Kena, Katha, Mundaka etc.
