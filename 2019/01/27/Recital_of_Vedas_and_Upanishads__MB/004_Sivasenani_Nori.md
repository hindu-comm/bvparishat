Sri Harsha garu

  

If you are going to invest the effort required to learn svaras, it would be so much more fulfilling to learn them from a guru, at least the Panchasuktas. I don't know your geographical location, but nowadays even in US one can find a guru to teach Veda.

  

I know that you didn't ask for this, but I admire your Shraddha and wanted to urge you to go the whole hog.

  

Regards

N Siva Senani
