Dear Sir,

  

I'd like to add something to that.

  

This is not just a place for Vidvans but also a place for neophytes such as myself to benefit from the knowledge and wisdom of the Vidvans. If darkness does not exist, there will be no appreciation for light.

  

It is the same for Vidvans. Without ignorant people such as myself, who will ask the pertinent questions that elicit the required response from Vidvans? In any conversation there is a vakta and a srota. A good narrative is built upon pertinent questions that need to be answered as a record for future students of shastra.

  

So kindly make some space for us too..:)

  

My 2 cents worth.

  

Kind Regards,

  

Niranjan
