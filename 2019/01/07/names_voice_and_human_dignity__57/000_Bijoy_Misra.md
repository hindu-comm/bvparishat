Friends,

Good morning.

One of the most fundamental discoveries of India has been that a human being

is attributed with a voice, which is distinctive in each person. It is quite possible

that animals or trees also have the distinction, but we cannot detect those  

distinctions as we do in the human beings. Because of this unique distinctiveness,

India discovered that each human being was special and demands equal respect.

This has been the beauty of India's philosophical discourses over the centuries.

We lump it in "diversity" as a phrase.

The diversity stays in the voice. Our bodies can be shackled or sold, but not

our voices. In our voice we are always free. Truth lives in our voice. Hence we call

the first manifested identity in us as our voice or the intent of the voice, called

vƒÅk in literature. The recognition of this identity at our birth is the step to humanity

that began the civilization. When one lives by oneself, one does not need a voice.

When we group together, our voice is recognized.

The recognition of the voice is called naming in human society. Names are not

labels, but identifiers. There is a larger issue of cognition and information protocol

which is a matter of research. But those have to do with generic classifications

like water, sky, tree or man. But when it comes to individual names, it is a name  

that has a voice.

There are attempts in cultures to change names or hide names. People hide

names when they don't wish to take responsibility. Many use multiple names

to hide their activities. However scholarship is a function of mutual respect and

authenticity. In a no name robotic culture, we can rehash the exiting knowledge

but cannot advance knowledge. All scholarship stems from creative undertaking

than repeating some book. It is analysis than reproduction. Analysis or creation

has an author.

In this forum, I have been requesting people to be a voice than a shell. Through our

own discipline we can elevate the forum to a productive research group when ideas

are advanced, discussed and expanded. We have a variety of talents in the group.  

I request all to strive for authenticity in your voice than distort it through various

means. I hope I have convinced you to think that your voice is your identity.  

Identification of your voice is your own dignity. You are not a wayside object bit

a respectful participant in a group.

I would request people to compose responses than throwing robotic citations

from third party sources. Please be a partner in conversation, so we create  

scholarship, the forum is Vidvatprishat.  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
