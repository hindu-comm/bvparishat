Dear Sri Niranjan,

  

There are no vaktA here, we are all vidyArthI. All people should be welcome, but all should  

have a goal. Random learning is not a goal. Some studies would be helpful before throwing

a question. Many questions appear ill-posed and without merit. Journalistic ignorance clearance

is not a goal, but some svAdhyAya must be tried. We have to elevate the state of analytic thinking  

in the free country. Random talk and casual opinions are not a good symptom. Do study a book of  

your interest and phrase an intelligent question on the book. More books the better. Throwing

questions without homework is not good. Strive learning. Do think of contributing to the Forum.  

As a matter of fact, "contribute" to the discussion wherever you are.

  

it would have been very useful had you analyzed any sentence of my write up and conducted

some research! Something to your interest might have existed there.
Then we have vidyA,  

otherwise viparyaya!

  

Hope many would listen.. Do not copy or throw citations, but study and distill.  

  

Best regards,  

  

BM
