The point that is made in the paper ‘Abhijňāna-s’akuntalā – 225 years of Textual Criticism’, "textual criticism must precede literary criticism" theoretically sounds valid. But the author himself made it clear in the same speech that it would not be possible!



Here are some of my thoughts on this topic:



1. "If textual criticism takes place first..." - then we will never be able to come to the stage wherewe can comfortably say, 'Yes, now the text is finalized. Let me beginwith my literary criticism'. (This point has been highlighted in the 'journey of the text' section of the paper).



2. Literary criticism givesthe readers all the benefits of Kavya that Mammata has listed in KavyaPrakasha (in the author’s words, "every literary person of the past and the present is bound to be impressed with literary criticism"). Only if the literary people see those benefits they will proceed further to explore the domain of textual criticism to explore the depths of the Kavya.



3. Let's assumea person says 'looks like there hundreds of versions of Mahabharata in manuscript form (not to mention the number of printed versions). I am confused. I do not know which one to read. Until all the textual criticism is complete and final version is arrived at, I would not read Mahabharata'. Will that person beable start reading Mahabharata in his life time? 



4. Literary criticism first and then the textual criticism later in Sanskrit (or for that matter any language) pedagogyis neither damaging nor a crime. It is very easy to prove this point.Only through literary criticism, a text's literary value can be assessed. Only after knowing the literary value ofAbhijňāna-s’akuntalam, Dr Vasantakumar M. Bhatt has started his textual criticism of the same. He didnot takeany random manuscript out of the lakhs of manuscripts that are rotting in the libraries across India.



Let the inquisitive and explorative minds keep digging intothe available manuscripts in the form oftextual criticism, while literary criticism is being enjoyed by all. These twotypes of criticismsdo occurin a cyclicalmanner for ever, while theentry point, no doubt, is always literary criticism only.
