Sir, the paper (The “Abhijňāna-s’akuntalā” – 225 years of Textual Criticism) presents a detailed account of all the recensions and editions that Shakuntala has undergone till now including the best endeavour made by you with publishing the critical edition by you based on Sharada MS.

Now doubt the work made by you has opened new Windows to the world of textual criticism that will be a milestone in the history of TC.  

I appreciate your efforts and contributions.  

  

Regards

Sugyan Kumar Mahanty
