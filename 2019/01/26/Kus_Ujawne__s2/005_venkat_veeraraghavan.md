Ok. There are certain versions of the MB where I have read about Draupadi who was an ayonija daughter of Drupada.  
She used to live 1 year in the company of one husband and at the end of that period she would enter the fire and come back as a virgin. Now considering that Draupadi was a Yajnaprasada, She was in no way or sense a normal woman. Whether what she did would apply to normal women is another question altogether.

  

Not much is known about the actual ritual, but that would be an area for you to conduct youur research.  

  

All the best.
