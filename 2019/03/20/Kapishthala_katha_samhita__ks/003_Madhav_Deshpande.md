Thanks Vishal for this information regarding manuscripts of the Kapiṣṭhala-Kaṭha-Saṃhitā. This may be a tangential suggestion. There is a town named Kapisthalam in Tamil Nadu. Does this place name have any connection with this Śākhā? Or the is name is derived from some other association? Someone on BVP may know something about this place.
