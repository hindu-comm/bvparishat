Dear Sri Vishal-ji,

  

Thank you very much for your reply with this valuable information. It does seem that this book is extremely rare. I, too, would not risk sending the microfilm of it through the mail.

  

Thanks also for letting me know that it is in Bengali script. Neither Jagadisha Chandra Chatterji nor B. Faddegon mentioned this. Bengali script is still OK for me.

  

You are very kind to offer to share this when it becomes possible. Working with microfilm is slow, and you no doubt have many other things to do. I am just happy to know that you may get to it when the opportunity arises.

  

With thanks and best regards,

  

David Reigle
