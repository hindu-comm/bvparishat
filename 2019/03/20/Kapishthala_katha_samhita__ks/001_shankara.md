Ramanujachar ji,

  

Namaste!  

  

Are you sure that Kapisthala Katha Samhita was edited by SD Satwalekr? I could not find any information on this in the volumes of Vedic Bibliography of RN Dandekar or in 'Vedic Literature' by Jan Gonda 1971.  

  

Both the bibliographies and catalogue sites mention only Raghu Vira's edition of KKS.

Kapiṣṭhala-Kaṭha-Saṃhitā : a text of the Black Yajurveda ed by Raghuvira 1966

  

You might already know that there is 'Krishna Yajurvediya Kathaka Samhita' edited by SD Satwalekar.  

  

regards  
shankara
