Kapishthala is a gotra of Brahmanas found in several parts of India - Gujarat (Bharuch/Ankaleshvar area), Kashmir, Tamil Nadu and so on - so among both Panchagauda and Panchadraavidas. I think Durga too writes in his Nirukta commentary that "I am a Kapishthala Vashishtha'. His native place was Jambusar, which is also in Gujarat.
