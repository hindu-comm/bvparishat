Namaskar and apologies for the delay in replying. My digital copy is actually a Microform Reel which I could read till the local University Library changed their microform readers due to which I can no longer fit the reel on the spindle :-( The work is in Bengali script BTW.

  

Yes, there was only 1 copy in the west - India Office Library. Several years back, I tried a lot to get it from them through my university's Interlibrary Loan but always got the reply that it is not available in their collection. So it must have been lost or got thrown away unfortunately. I discovered the existence of the original from which my roll was made by chance upon reading a very old catalog of the National Library (Calcutta).

  

When I get a chance, I will make some more attempts to figure out how to read the roll and make a copy. I'd be glad to share it with you and others of course. In the past, I have lost things in mail and this is the only reason why I hesitate to send the roll to you. I am in Minneapolis, and had visited CO in July 17' and February 18' but am not sure when I will come next.

  

Regards,

  

Vishal Agarwal
