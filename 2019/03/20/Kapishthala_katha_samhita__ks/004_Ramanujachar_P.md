Shri Shankaraji!

  

Pranam.

  

While developing ISCII standard for Vedic svaras at CDAC in 1990, I used a book of Kapishthala Katha Samhita of Svadhyaya Mandal, Aundh \[this is from memory, could be mistaken!).

we included shakha-specific svara markings for internal representation in Computers for data processing, svara search etc.

  

However, If Shri Vishal Aggarwal also concurs on Shripad Damodar Satavalekar not publishing it, I might be wrong in assuming so.

Shri Raghu Vira's version does not have accents, while I remember using an accented edition. Is it possible or my memory is failing me?

  

Regards
