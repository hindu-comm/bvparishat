Please note that only a third of the Kathaka Samhita is accented, rest is not.

  

Also, all of the Kathaka Samhita manuscripts have not been utilised. For instance, the BORI Manuscript Catalog (Vedic manuscripts) lists a 'Shatpath Brahmana' manuscripts with 'sthaanakas', which is actually a Kathaka Samhita manuscript that is broken. And like I mentioned, it remains to be seen whether the Kathaka Samhita manuscripts in Melukote belong to this Shakha or are the Kapishthala Katha Samhita manuscripts.

  

Professor Braj Behari Chaubey was preparing an edition of the complete Kathaka Aranyaka (the present edition of Michael Witzel covers only the Pravargya portion) but unfortunately he passed away before it was published. I presume that he did prepare a publication ready draft. In short, from what I gather, the Katha Aranyaka ran parallel to the Taittiriya Aranyaka, with chapters on Aruna, Svadhyaya, Purushavidya and even a version of the Mahanarayana Upanishad. The Kathavalli and Kathashiksha Upanishads are already printed, and the Kathashruti apparently belonged to the lost Kathaka Brahmana because that is how it is quoted in Sannyasa Paddhatis (and it runs parallel to the Manavashrautasutra sections on preSannyasa ceremonies).
