Shri Deshpande ji!

  

Kapisthalam in TamilNadu on the banks of river Kaveri, a Vaishnavite divya desam sung by Alvar, may not be related to this Vedic shakha

as Taittiriya is prevalent in the region among KYVedins.

Also, the name does not use cerebralisation unlike the Shakha name \[which may be proper\].

  

Visistadvaita Vijayadhvaja Mahamhopadhyaya Sri u.Ve. Kapisthalam Desikacarya, \[19th-20th Century\],

first Principal of SVUORI, Tirupati, was a prolific scholar from this divya-desa.
