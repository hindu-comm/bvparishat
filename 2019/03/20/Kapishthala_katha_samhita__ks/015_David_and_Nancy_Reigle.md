Dear Sri Vishal Agarwal,

  

In your reply to another thread, you mentioned getting with great difficulty a scan of the Bharadvajavrittibhashya on the Vaisheshika Sutras (minus the first four pages). This is a book that I have been seeking for many, many years. There is no copy in North America, and apparently only one copy in the whole western hemisphere. It is, or was, in the India Office Library, according to Jagadisha Chandra Chatterji's 1912 book, The Hindu Realism, p. x (and also according to B. Faddegon's 1918 book, The Vaicesika-System, pp. 35, 519). Would you be willing to make your scan of it available, either on the web, or to individuals who may want it like myself?

  

It does not show up in the Catalogue of the India Office Library, Sanskrit Books, at least that I could find. The India Office Library has now been transferred to the British Library. Nor could I find it in their online catalogues. I would be happy to write to them asking if they can find it, and if I could purchase scans from them of the first four pages that are missing in your scan.

  

Thank you.

  

Best regards,
