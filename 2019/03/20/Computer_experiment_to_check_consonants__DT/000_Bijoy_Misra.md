Dear scholars,

For some time we have been engaged here in exploring

the processes that may explain the conversion of a neurological

thought signal to an acoustical product, known as "word".

We plan to do a pitch experiment with the Paninian consonants

using a newly developed software. We would appreciate volunteer

research participants in the experiment. The only qualification

needed is a clarity of voice in expressing a Paninian consonant

compounding with the vowel à¤…. We would need a sample of different  

language speakers. Accent, tone, age or sex would be immaterial.  

You would need access to a PC with about an hour's time to record  

your voice on the 33 principal consonants.

Please write to me privately if you would like to participate.

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
