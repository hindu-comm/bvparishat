Dear Sri Abhyankar,

Good morning.

At the moment, we are looking at single syllables. We wish to track the creation and the morphology

of the syllable. The sequencing is a further step. We wish to be able to delineate the processes that  

help convert the neurological signal to an acoustic signal. We would be looking for language speakers

worldwide. After consonants, we plan to handle the vowels. We are into expression than application.

We enunciated our goal in our paper last year. I can resend such that you may make another review.

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra.
