I think the experiment can be done with select letters and phrases, e.g.

Just the शिवसूत्राणि from 5 to 14. They cover all the consonants. शिवसूत्र # 11 is the longest !

Ask North Indians to pronounce स्त्री

Pronunciation of ज्ञ varies all across India. ज्ञ is actually ज् + ञ. It is hardly ever pronounced that way.

Pronunciation of even योग suffers, often being pronounced as योगा, maybe, because English spelling Yoga has the 'a' at the end.

There seems to be a convention in Tamil, that names ending in अ e.g. my name अभ्यंकर should be not only pronounced, but written asஅப்யங்கரா (अप्यङ्करा) Pronunciation of योग as योगा may also have that background. Note, Tamil has only प्, which stands for फ् ब् भ्also. Pronunciation of consonants will hence certainly have such *regional influence*. It is common knowledge pronunciation of भद्रः by a Bengali may sound as भोद्रो.

1.  I will be curious, how such influences will influence the mapping in
    the brain

Pronunciation of अनुस्वार-s is also a matter of contention, e.g.

1.  यं यं वापि स्मरन् भावं त्यजत्यन्ते कलेवरम् (गीता 8'6)
2.  तँ ह कुमारँ सन्तं (कठ. 1'1'2)  

Pronunciation of विसर्ग-sis also a matter of contention, especially those with जिह्वामूलीय and उपध्मानीय e.g. मामकाः पाण्डवाश्चैव (गीता 1'1)  

Long words e.g. आचार्यान्मातुलान्भ्रातॄन्पुत्रान्पौत्रान्सखींस्तथा (गीता 1'26) Actually such word is difficult, more at the sight of it. But it is not difficult, if one has some elementary knowledge of Sanskrit and in turn, knows, where to split the long word.

Even with what little knowledge I have of Sanskrit, I end to fumble.
Presently we are studying कठोपनिषत्. When reading यथा पुरस्ताद्भविता प्रतीतऔद्दालकिरारुणिर्मत्प्रसृष्टः \| सुखँ रात्रीः शयिता वीतमन्युस्त्वां ददृशिवान्मृत्युमुखात्प्रमुक्तम्(1'1'11) I confess that I have to be very conscious of each and every letter.

Conducting the experiment with such select letters and phrases would greatly shorten the time to be spared by the volunteers.
