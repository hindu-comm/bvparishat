Dr Raghuvira notes in the preface of the edition that the Svara markings on the manuscripts used by him were so full of errors that he chose to omit them in his printed edition.

  

On another note, in addition to the Kapishthala Grhya manuscript at Kolkata, another manuscript of this text exists in the Saraswati Bhawan library of Sanskrit University, Varanasi. The manuscript was copied around 1850 CE and has several lacuna in the middle, and a transcript of the same exists at the Ramlal Kapoor Trust at Bahalgarh, Sonepat\[1\]. It is written in the Devanagari script and is divided into adhyayas and patalas. At the beginning of the manuscript is the benediction, “Sri Purushottamaya” and at the end, it reads “iti sri kapishthala grhyasutre vrshotsarjanavidhih \| srimat kapishthalakathiya bhārgavajā”.\[2\]
