Bijoy,  
I have read Majumdar. Extensively. Here are some excerpts from Majumdar's Advanced History of India with my comments interspersed.  
  
\[Mazumdar\] Page:267: On the latter’s death, the Muslim territories in Sind were divided between two independent chiefs, those of Mansurah (near Bahmanabad) and Multan. Neither of these ever attained to great power, and both had to live in constant dread of their Indian neighbours, particularly the Imperial Pratiharas of Kanauj. The Arab conquest of Sind did not immediately produce any far-reaching political effect, and it has been described by Mr. Stanley Lane-Poole as “an episode in the history of India and of Islam, a triumph without results”.  
  
\[Shivraj\] Mazumdar says the same thing as Hunter vis a vis the Sind Rajputs.  
  
\[Mazumdar\] Page:268 Sultan Mahmud, who carried to fruition the policy Sabuktigin of his father was undoubtedly one of the greatest military leaders the world has ever seen. His cool courage, prudence, resourcefulness and other qualities make him one of the most interesting personalities in Asiatic history.....Great as a warrior, the Sultan was no less eminent as a patron of arts and letters.  
  
\[Shivraj\] Majumdar almost acting as an apologist. And look at the peacock term "greatest military leader..." . Majumdar fails to mention that many Indian kings defeated this "greatest military general" . One of the finest temples in the Khajurao complex, Kandariya Mahadev temple, was built by Vidhyadhar Chandela as a commemoration after defeating Mahmud of Ghazni. This temple still stands and if you have not visited it please do. You can read more here:

\[Mazumdar\]Page:268 But in spite of all this, to the historian of India he appears mainly as an insatiable mvader. He was neither a missionary for the propagation of religion in this country nor an architect of empire. The main object of his eastern expeditions seems to have been the acquisition of the "wealth of Ind" and the destruction of the morale of its custodians.  
\[Shivraj\]: Why was Somnath destroyed? Why were many other temples destroyed? Is that not propagation of religion?  
  
\[Mazumdar\]Page:268 ..Neither the Arabs nor the Ghaznavid (Yamini) Turks succeeded in adding India to the growing empire of Islam but they paved the way for that final struggle which overwhelmed the Gangetic kingdoms some two hundred years later.  
\[Shivraj\]: "Neither the arabs nor ..." is Same as Hunter's analysis. Mazumdar's prediction of "two hundred years..." is not based on facts.  
  
200 years later:  
  
\[Mazumdar\]Page:269 The first Indian expedition of Muhammad of Ghur (a.d. 1175), directed against his co-religionists, the Isma'ilan heretics of Multan was attended with success, and he soon captured the strong fortress of Uch by a stratagem. But his invasion of Gujarat in A.D. 1178 proved a failure; the raja of Gujarat inflicted a terrible defeat on him.  
\[Shivraj\] No name mentioned of the raja who inflicted this terrible defeat on Ghori. The exact location of the battle or what tactics were employed by the raja. Bijoy Do you know the name of this raja? Which clan he belonged to?  
Read about this here:  
<http://hindurajput.blogspot.com/#Prithviraj_Chauhan>  
  
\[Majumdar\]Page:270  
When, in the winter of 1190-1191, Muhammad of Ghur marched beyond the Punjab, Prithviraj, the bold and chivalrous hero of the Rajputs, who were in no way inferior in bravery and courage to the invaders, advanced to oppose him with a large army, including, according to Ferishta, 200,000 horse and 3,000 elephants. Prithviraj had the support of many of his fellow Rajput princes, but Jaichand held aloof. The Ghuri invader stood in the middle of his army with two wings on two sides and met the Rajputs at Tarain near Thanesar in a.d. 1191. Fighting with their usual vigour, the Rajputs greatly harassed the Muslim troops, who weresoon overpowered, and their leader, being severely wounded, retired to Ghazni. But Muhammad did not become disheartened at this initial failure. He soon raised a strong army with a view to avenging his defeat, and with adequate preparations, invaded India once again in 1192 and met his Rajput adversary on the same field. By superior tactics and generalship, the invading army inflicted a severe defeat on the Rajputs.  
\[Shivraj\]: In 1191 Prithviraj defeats Ghori and next year looses. When Ghori looses rajputs displayed no tactics or generalship just fought with vigour. When the rajputs loose the other side had superior tactics and generalship!  
  
\[Shivraj\]: Let us fast forward to the Mughal time. In the chapter on Mughals he spends just two paragraphs on Maharana Pratap!  
  
All this shows that Majumdar's analysis leaves lot to be desired.  
  
And you yourself are not answering the question why did India remain a Hindu country while every other nation from Arabia to the western borders of India converted?  
  
Please don't propagate Majumdar's shallow knowledge. It is incumbent on Indians to know their history correctly and not pedal shoddy works of others.  

  
Shivraj
