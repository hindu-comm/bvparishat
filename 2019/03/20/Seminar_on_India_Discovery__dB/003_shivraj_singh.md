Bijoy,  
  
Your statement below is not factual.  
  
"While the diversity blossomed in the country the apparent non-centrality weakened the nation making it easy for the invaders to break in and plunder. Though some resistance was offered, an artistic nation could not defend itself against the brutal terrorists who were looking for food and shelter using force and sword! "  
  
Question to think :  
Why/How do you think India remained a Hindu country while every other nation from Arabia to the western border of India was converted? Have you heard of Parsis and what happened to their country?  
  
Was the benevolence of Invaders specific to India?  
  
It might be useful if you read this:  
  
"Within a hundred years after his (Muhammad's) death, his followers had invaded the countries of Asia as far as the Hindu Kush. Here there progress was stayed and Islam had to consolidate itself during three more centuries before it grew strong enough to grasp the rich prize of India. But almost from first the Arabs had fixed eager eyes upon that wealthy country. Fifteen years after the death of prophet, Usman sent a sea expedition to Thana and Broach on the Bombay coast (647 ? AD). Other raids towards Sindh took place in 662 and 664 with no results.  
The armies of Islam had carried the crescent from the Hindu Kush westwards, through Asia, Africa and Southern Europe, to distant Spain and Gaul, before they obtained a foothold in Punjab. This long delay was due, not only to the daring of individual tribes, such as Sindh Rajputs, just mentioned but to the military organization of the Hindu Kingdoms.  
Each of these groups of kingdoms, alike in the north and in the south, had a certain power of coherence to oppose to a foreign invader; while the large number of groups and units rendered conquest a very tedious process. For even when the overlord or central authority was vanquished, the separate units had to be defeated in detail, and each state supplied a nucleus for subsequent revolt. We have seen how the brilliant attempt in 711, to found a lasting Muhammedan dynasty in Sindh, failed. Three centuries later, the utmost efforts of two great Musalman invaders (Mahmud of Ghazni and Mohammed Ghori) from the north-west only succeeded in annexing a small portion of the frontier Punjab Province between 977 and 1176 A.D. The Hindu power in Southern India was not completely broken till the battle of Talikot in 1565; and within a hundred years, in 1650, the great Hindu revival had commenced which under the form of Maratha confederacy, was destined to break up the Mughal Empire in India. That Empire, even in the north of India, had only been consolidated by Akbar's policy of incorporating Hindu chiefs into his government(1556-1605). Up to Akbar's time, and even during the earlier years of his reign a series of Rajput wars had challenged the Muhammadan supremacy. In less than two centuries after his death, the successor of Akbar was a puppet in the hand of the Hindu marathas at Delhi.  
The popular notion that India fell an easy prey to the Musalmans is opposed to the historical facts. Muhammadan rule in India consists of a series of invasions and partial conquests, during eleven centuries, from Usman's raid, circ.647, to Ahmad Shah's tempest of invasion in 1761 A.D.  
At no time was Islam triumphant throughout the whole of India. Hindu dynasties always ruled over large areas. At the height of the Muhammadan power, the hindu princes paid tribute, and sent agents to the Imperial court. But even this modified supremacy of Delhi lasted for little over a century (1578-1707). Before the end of that brief period the Hindus had begun the work of reconquest. The native chivalry of Rajputana was closing in upon Delhi from the south; the religious confederation of the Sikhs was growing into a military power on the north-west. The Marathas had combined the fighting powers of the low-castes with the statesmen ship of the Brahmans, and were subjecting the Muhammadan kingdoms throughout all India to tribute. So far as can now be estimated, the advance of the English power at the beginning of the present century alone saved the Mughal Empire from passing to the Hindus."

Namaskar,  
Also refer to the book '  
Indian Chronology to Indian History'. It gives the  
solution to all burning issues related to the Chronology of  
Ancient Indian History as per Indian records based upon the  
discovery of 7000 years old calendar. The book is available  
on Amazon websites.

Friends,  
We struggle here to accumulate and  

analyze as much informationas possible to help  

create a possible definition of Indian culture  

forour future youth. As we enter into the  
Mughal period, we discoverhow the unpreparedness  

has left people homeless. The artists  

havebecome beggars, the scholars are looking for  
patronage. The resourcesof India are  

depleted. Possibly more sad news awaits us as we go  
forward.  
I wrote a blog last Monday to invite  
people for our public seminar where  
we would present our findings. I  
am sharing. It is the story as we seeupto  

1500AD.<https://indiadiscoverycenter.blogspot.com/2019/03/the-story-of-india-upto-1500ad.html>  

The seminar is March 31, Sunday  

afternoon here in a local library.You are welcome  

to join if around.
