Thank you, Nagarajji.

Our view is that is the earlier momentum did keep the economy moving  

The marine trade gradually diminished through piracy (Dutch, Portuguese, French, English)  

Land trade had suffered before through looting.

Mughals did give some state support, but they didn't know the products.

Heavy selective taxation caused people to lose lands and to lose their traditional pursuit.

It is a sad story.  

I will post our work next month after we are done.

  

Here is a blog I did last week.
