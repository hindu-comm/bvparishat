This is the full paragraph as we word it:

  

Technological discovery and the production of iron helped change the Indian landscape into  
massive structures and monuments. The period 500AD to 1500AD saw large scale expansion  

of trade producing increase in wealth in local regions. The centrality of India's administration  

was reduced with the development of local economy fueled by maritime trade. Regional languages  
developed which propelled regional literature. Further sophistication and creativity occurred  
in food, dress, art, music and dance. While the diversity blossomed in the country the apparent

  
non-centrality weakened the nation making it easy for the invaders to break in and plunder.

Though some resistance was offered, an artistic nation could not defend itself against the  
brutal terrorists who were looking for food and shelter using force and sword!   

  

Please help rephrase as you see.

I will check tomorrow.
