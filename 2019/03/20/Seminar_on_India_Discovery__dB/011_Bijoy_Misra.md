Dear Sri Shivraj,

  

Please be a partner if you can. Everything can be criticized.  

We study, analyze and map as we see. We have an obligation

to create an accountable definition before we (the first generation

immigrants) die. We also tacitly think what might sustain worldwide  

given the competition of cultures and nations. Our effort is to

understand our own community as group, its successes, handicaps,

weaknesses and the creativity. We have to go intellectually.  

  

I have reproduced the paragraph in an earlier mail. Kindly review

and modify it as you see fit. We have our meeting Saturday and

I will put it for discussion. We have a dozen persons from different

areas of India who study and participate.

  

I do admire your passion and your deep reading. Please guide us

such that we can talk to young High School children in order that  

they may appreciate. Our March 31 seminar is preliminary to help

develop our language. We plan a youth Conference along with the

Secondary School teachers in the summer to help create the tool of  

instruction. Our seminars end in 2020, then we create a Virtual India  

portal and an education center later.  

  

Please help in articulating the ideas as you see appropriate.

  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
