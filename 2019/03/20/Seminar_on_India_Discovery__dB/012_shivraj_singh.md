Bijoy,  
  
Your research group may want to target the following questions:  
Why did India remain a Hindu country while every other country from Arabia to western borders of India converted.(It would be useful to include north africa , spain , portugal and parts of Italy into this research. The reason I bring up Italy is because Italians have old sayings which are still current in their society which show a great fear of the invaders. While in India I haven't heard any lokokti or muhavara in which people seem scared of the invaders.).  
  
Many wrong answers are repeated ad-nauseum by Indians as well as non Indians:  
  
- Benevolence of Invaders (though people who propagate this never tackle why benevolence only shown in India or to Indians).  
  
- Inherent Strength of Hinduism!! This argument is the favourite of Indians. These same Indians haven't studied Al Biruni.  
  
-Blame Buddhism. This is also a favourite of Indian scholars especially Hindus who seem to hate Buddhism with a vengeance.  
  
And if all this leads somewhere than perhaps it becomes a module to teach .  
  
Shivraj

Dear  
Sri Shivraj,  
Please be  
a partner if you can. Everything can be criticized.  
We study, analyze and map as we  

see. We have an obligationto create an  

accountable definition before we (the first  

generationimmigrants) die. We also tacitly  

think what might sustain worldwide  
given the competition of cultures  

and nations. Our effort is tounderstand our own  

community as group, its successes,  

handicaps,weaknesses and the creativity. We  

have to go intellectually.  
  
I have reproduced the paragraph in  

an earlier mail. Kindly reviewand modify it as  

you see fit. We have our meeting Saturday andI  
will put it for discussion. We have a dozen persons from  

differentareas of India who study and  

participate.  
I do  
admire your passion and your deep reading. Please guide  

ussuch that we can talk to young High School  

children in order that  
they may  
appreciate. Our March 31 seminar is preliminary to  

helpdevelop our language. We plan a youth  
Conference along with theSecondary School
