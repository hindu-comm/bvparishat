Friends,

  

We struggle here to accumulate and analyze as much information

as possible to help create a possible definition of Indian culture for

our future youth. As we enter into the Mughal period, we discover

how the unpreparedness has left people homeless. The artists have

become beggars, the scholars are looking for patronage. The resources

of India are depleted. Possibly more sad news awaits us as we go  

forward.

  

I wrote a blog last Monday to invite people for our public seminar where  

we would present our findings. I am sharing. It is the story as we see

upto 1500AD.

The seminar is March 31, Sunday afternoon here in a local library.

You are welcome to join if around.

  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
