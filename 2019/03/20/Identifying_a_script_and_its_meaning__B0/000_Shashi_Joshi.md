Namaste vidvatjanAH,

I have a small request.

  

In the two attached images, there is some writing. It is easily visible in the blackboard with the tiger. In the other, it is in the black strips, and you may have to zoom in a bit (or a lot).

  

If anyone can shed any light on these - what script it is, what does it say (transliteration) and what does it mean - I would be highly obliged.

  

I do not know the context of these, I was asked by a friend online, who got these from his uncle who had spent a long time in India.

  

  
  

Thanks,  

\~ Shashi
