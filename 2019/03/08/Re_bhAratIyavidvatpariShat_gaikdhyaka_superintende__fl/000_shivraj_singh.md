........  
Accordingly, strīvyavahārin means "dealing in women" which perfectly  
fits the context of this specific Arthaśāstra chapter (2.27) entitledgaṇikādhyakṣaḥ "superintendent of prostitutes". ......  
  
--------------------------------------  
  
Roland,  
Arth Shastr is attributed to Chanakya who happened to be a high ranking official in the realm of a powerful Indian King. It would be useful to observe how the household of a king was organised. In the household there was a particular group called "gayaṇ" whose job was to entertain the king, queens, and the mothers by singing.  
  
Each group had different gayaṇs who sang for their royal employers. These "gayaṇs" were exclusive for the royal household and their upkeep was the responsibility of the royalty. After a king died many a times these gayaṇs committed Sati. In some cases if for some reason they didn't commit Sati the sons of various kings are on record , of having given the "gayaṇs" of their fathers, jagirs for their upkeep. Royal gayaṇs lived in the fort.  
  
So to say gaṇikādhyakṣaḥ is always a "superintendent of prostitutes" is wrong. In the realm of a King's household this term would mean a supervisor of the office of royal gayaṇs.
