Pranam to all learned scholars,

  

When I asked a Sanskrit scholar, who has since passed away, about the meaning of word धारा used to mean the Article of the constitution, he gave me the following sloka, and asked me to infer the meaning myself:

विद्यातीर्थे जगति विबुधाः साधवः सत्यतीर्थे

गङ्गातीर्थे मलिनमनसो योगिनो ध्यानतीर्थे ।

धारातीर्थे धरणिपतयो दानतीर्थे धनाढ्या

लज्जातीर्थे कुलयुवतयः पातकं क्षालयन्ति ॥

I did not ask him about the source of the sloka, and the dictionaries I have do not help me to arrive at the correct meaning of the word: धारा ।

  

I hope the group will solve both the problems.

  

विदुषाम् अनुचरः

प्रकाशः
