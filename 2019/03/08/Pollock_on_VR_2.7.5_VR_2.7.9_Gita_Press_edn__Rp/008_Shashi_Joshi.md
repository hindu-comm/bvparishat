**artha** has another meaning - purpose, meaning, wealth ...

  

Here **artha-parA** is better translated as - one with some important/dear purpose/motive.

  

She being a queen, that too elderly queen, of **ayodhyA**, where even as per Valmiki, there were no flaws in citizens, won't be a miser.

  

Also, who is saying this statement? **mantharA**.

She comes from a more hardship-seen place in **kekeya**, and may not understand the magnanimity of traditional **kula** that have been taught values as part of growing up.

**mantharA** may not have seen people giving away just out of happiness and magnanimity.

  

Even then, 'with what great purpose/motive' seems a better translation of the contextual meaning, than 'miser'.

  

Choosing miser seems to show awareness only of the dictionary, not of the nuances of the culture.

  

IMHO.

  

  
Thanks,  
Shashi
