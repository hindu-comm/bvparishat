Dear all,

  

If we draw some honest conclusions from the thread of discussions, we have to admit that the Indian scholars learnt much from their western counterparts on the methodology of various research studies. It could be history, linguistics or any other science. We probably continue to do so because the west has, over centuries, been studying all aspects of all countries and had prepared a comprehensive narrative of their own. They could do so because they had occupied all countries and had all resources at their command. Politics and probably religion too dictated the course of the narrative.

  

A country like India, with brilliant intellectual achievements, was under subjugation for centuries and was fighting for preservation of its culture. We had no comprehensive world vision nor had command on resources as the west had.

  

Having admitted that, we have to say that the western attempts to destroy all cultures is disgusting. All western enlightenment of the 18th century was only after its interaction with the Indian civilization and I would not hesitate saying it was post hoc ergo propter hoc, though I am aware that the term refers to a logical fallacy. A logical fallacy may turn out to be the truth if it is properly investigated into. A lot of research is needed on the intellectual influence of east on the west.

  

Even after independence and even under continued attack on culture we have not opened our windows for studying other cultures. We continue to be regional scholars and not global scholars. For this one has to study Latin, Greek, Persian, etc, as our western counterparts do. I was surprised to read the book 'Empires of the Word: A Language History of the World' by the British scholar Nicholas Ostler who knows about 20 languages and has doctorates in six languages including one in Sanskrit. He has done a brilliant study on the influence of Sanskrit and has devoted nearly 60 pages for Sanskrit in his book.

  

I know a friend in USA who wanted to do Ph.D in Sanskrit in the Harvard University and when he was asked to do a certificate course in Latin he refused to do so. Rightly, he was not admitted for Ph.D. Long ago our English teacher had told - 'what does he know of English who knows English only?'. This applies to Sanskrit too. For instance, if we want to study the Rig Veda in its historical context (as the western scholars do) we may have to know the Zoroastrian texts. We have to study comparative mythology, etc. We need dedicated scholars who would spend years just to know facts. It is not enough if we have people whose religious sentiments are offended (as in my case) and who react in angry manner. There are some very senior professors in this group who know more on this and it would be a great service if some young scholars are groomed in this direction.

I know I am likely to be ridiculed, but as a student of Vedanta I am practicing to rise above such ridicules.

Regards,

Dr. Aravinda Rao
