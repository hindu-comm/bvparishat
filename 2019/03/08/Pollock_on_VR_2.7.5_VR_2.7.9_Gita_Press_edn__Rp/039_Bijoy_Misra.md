Dear Dr Slaje,

Thank you for your note. It clears an enigma  

I had thought that people picked up knowledge from

literal quotes. This is actually the difference between  

the Indian analysis and the western analysis. To be

self-evident is a part of the Indian culture which no

western scholar has so far understood!  

I appreciate your struggle and your interest in knowing

about India. Understanding is a different matter!

Best regards,

BM
