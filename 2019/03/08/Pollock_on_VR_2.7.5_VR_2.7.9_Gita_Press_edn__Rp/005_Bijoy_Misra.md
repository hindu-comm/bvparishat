It is not "intentional", it is pure ignorance.

Cultural familiarity does not come by reading books!  

  

अर्थपरा is not in the dictionary. Look for अर्थ, get wealth,

परा does not exist in dictionary either, so stretch by thinking "after", "After wealth" - make up "miserly!"  

It is juvenile. Massive boycott may help!

  

I do get irritated since our children are exposed to this nonsense!

We have to speak loudly..
