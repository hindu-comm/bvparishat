None of the great contributors to Indic knowledge traditions that antedated European and other western knowledge traditions by millennia (This expression was used in reference to Panini by modern linguists, though this applies to many Panini-like geniuses of ancient Indic knowledge traditions) even tried to decipher the kharoshThi or any other inscriptions to become the geniuses that they were. Panini did not read comparative philology or general linguistics, authors of sikshaa granthas did not read modern books of phonology to produce those unparalleled works on the subject matter.

  

The author of Mokshopaya or Yogavaas'ishTha did not do any historico-critical philology of the previous Vedanta texts to produce those amazing works.

  

One bird with one flying style and singing style calling itself the ornithologist of the other bird that has another flying style and singing style does not make that boasting bird the ornithologist.
