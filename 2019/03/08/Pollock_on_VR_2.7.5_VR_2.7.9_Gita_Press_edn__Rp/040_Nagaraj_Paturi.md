Dear Sri Aditya Pillai,

  

Neutrality of method was a good question from you.

  

But the problem here is the claim that all method comes from the modern and as an implication from the West.

  

What is viewed as being 'tradition' in this case is a method in itself.

  

Culturally rootedness of the method is what goes against it's neutrality. That implies multiplicity of methods.

  

Claim from one of the methods that it is THE method and rest all is 'tradition' and as such 'tradition' should be grateful to the giver of THE method is what is not acceptable.

  

In the case of the method of the s"aastras , neutrality was pursued as an ideal , of course like in modern method, but it was theorised and instructed as being bound to the personality of the S'aastrakaara as much as being attempted to be ensured in the mechanics of the method.

  

Translation errors being rooted, among other things, cultural ignorance, ignoring or insensitivity , of course, is closer to the theme of the thread.
