Dear Dr Shastry,

I did think the direction you had in mind.

But should we go into English language linguistics in this group here?

We just have to make a blanket statement that the nuances of Sanskrit literature

do not permit the literal use of words.  

Also there are no "swords". "Literal" and "conceptual" are two different tracks in research.

"gravity of the words" is different than the "gravity of the earth"

What is said is the use of dictionaries in finding a meaning.  

Understanding is a practiced art and not obtained through the books - so is the message I see.

Best regards,

BM
