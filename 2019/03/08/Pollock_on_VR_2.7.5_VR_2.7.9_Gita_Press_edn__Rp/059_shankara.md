Namaste,

  

\<\<Despite being a Mahākavi, Kalhaṇa received little attention from his fellow countrymen in the Indian plains until Aurel Stein brought his work to light by a monumental edition in 1892 (prepared from now lost manuscripts) and by an English translation in 1900.>\>

  

Sanskrit text of Rajatarangini was edited and published at least twice before Aurel Stein did it in 1892.

  

1835 - Rajatarangini of Kalhana with sequels by Jonaraja, Srivara and Prajyabhatta published by Baptist Mission Press, Calcutta.

  

1840 - Sanskrit text of Rajatarangini of Kalhana with French translation by M. Anthony Troyer in 2 volumes.

  

1879-1898 - English Translation of Rajatarangini of Kalhana in 3 Volumes by Jogesh Chunder Dutt.   

  

1892 - Rajatarangini of Kalhana along with sequels by Jonaraja, Srivara and Prajyabhatta published by Dept of public instruction, Bombay and edited by M.M. Durgaprasada and Peter Peterson in 3 volumes.

  

So, I wonder what is meant by 'Kalhaṇa received little attention from his fellow countrymen in the Indian plains until Aurel Stein brought his work to light by a monumental edition in 1892'?

shankara
