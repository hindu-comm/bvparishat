This thread has been quite informative and that was a great write up by Dr. Walter Slaje! I hope this list would have a greater diversity of opinion. The difference between 'tradition' and 'method' seems apt in terms of retrieving information about the tradition from 'outside' it. But is method always so formal and neutral as is implied in the case of Princep. Don't most applications of method have some implicit affiliations to sets of values? At least, minimally, in terms of what gets highlighted and what gets left out, what questions are asked, etc.

  

While I don't agree with a lot of empty rhetorical/patriotic 'writing back' which is very prominent in this list, I would like to know if this 'method' can simply be a cerebral exercise, without any implications of value. I'm not sure as I'm not a scholar, but i would like to hear more on this topic.  

  

As Feynman would have it, it seems the birds would never agree with the categorizations of the ornithologists.
