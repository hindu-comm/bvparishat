Walter,  
Thanks for the writeup. Since RT manuscript was found at Lahore it implies Ranjit Singh's durbar. It also means that Ranjit Singh's library was not an exception.  
  
But why don't we find many copies? Many large princely states when they lost to Mughals or Afghans invariably the libraries were burnt. Even today when the forts are repaired manuscripts come out of crevices!  
  
Rajasthan and other parts of India has had many history authors and books that have survived. For example :  
1) Kanhad-de-Prabandh by Padmanabh written in 1455. describes the battle between the Chauhan household of Jalore with Khilji.  
2) Dalpat Vilas written by Dalpat of Bikaner during Akbar's reign. 16th century.  
3) Muhnot Nainsi Ri Khyat . This is a massive tome written during the time of Maharaj Jaswant Singh 1 of Jodhpur . Written before 1660's.  
4) Vansh Bhaskar by Suryamal Mishan.  
5) Achaldas Khichi Ri Vachanika.  
  
And so on...  
  
Next we need to focus on how history was transmitted in India. Every major clan of kings had their own bards. The bards used to travel throughout villages and sing songs of history of various clans through out the length and breadth of the rajasthan, Gujarat, MP etc. When the rulers changed from Hindus to Muslims these bards also got impacted. They no longer had patronage.  
  
Before the advent of television it was common in rajput villages for bards to come to a village , stay there for a month and every evening after meals bring out their musical instruments and sing for hours. Happened in village after village. This was the chief source of entertainment in the villages.  
  
When Milman Parry the professor from harvard travelled across the erstwhile yugoslavia he recorded songs of the bards in various villages just to point out a parallel. Funnily enough Parry thought he should teach the bards alphabet so that they could write what they have in memory. And Parry learnt the more he taught the bards alphabet the more the bards lost their memory!  
  
Coming to why Kalhan and others mentioned above are not taught in our schools. We have an education system in which the founding fathers of our education , who were all PhD's from top schools all over the world, didn't deem it necessary that India had any past worth talking about.  
  
For them We were just a nation who was beaten by everyone and learnt science and technology from others (never mind the iron pillar or the invention of crucible steel or even the "arabic" numerals or .... :) ! ).  
  
Our indigenous scholars also never made much attempt to really unearth the history of this country.  
  
As I mentioned earlier the bards sang in the villages of India hence history of the forefathers is well known to even the unlettered there. Though the TV and cable has made the bards a dying breed.  
  
Lastly if you look at the make up of the armed forces you will see an overwhelming majority of them from the villages. Not from cities.  
  
Shivraj
