The relevance of Dr. K. Aravinda Rao's post is that is the indication that what are being perceived / portrayed as translation errors might not be errors but a consequence of a fundamentally different objective of translation. In other words, the politics of translation. I am sure that the point whether Prof. Pollock's works suffer more from ignorance or from making translation subservient to a larger agenda can be discussed separately. My own view is that Pollock is a fine scholar, even if he allegedly cannot speak fluently in Sanskrit (as reported from his trip to India a few years ago); his agenda so clearly brought to light by Sri Rajiv Malhotra in 'The Battle for Sanskrit' is the issue. My view is that the agenda should be kept up front: after that, one has freedom to air ones views. So, if Prof. Pollock says "I want to show Sanskrit as a language of oppression" and then his translations are read in that light, I am ok with it. The problem is that his translations are being viewed as objective - and I think Dr. Aravinda Rao's post addresses that.
