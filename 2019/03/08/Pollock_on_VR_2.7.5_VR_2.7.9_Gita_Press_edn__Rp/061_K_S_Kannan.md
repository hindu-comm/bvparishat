Q.: What happened to the numerous literary/philosophical works in Kashmir prior to the 15th Century?

 What happened to the numerous official records in Kashmir prior to the 15th Century?

A.: Ask the boom(n) of Islamic fanatics : burn libraries, burn all records.

(Proof ?: Read Arvind Sharma.)  

  

Q.: What prevents India from taking control of its past and cherish its own historians?

A.: The (literally) bloody British (euphemism for Christian) legacy;

 the legacy of (the synonymous) Nehru, who was  

 "at home nowhere (i.e. either East or West), out of place everywhere".

 His great merit: destroying meritocracy.

(Is proof needed for this?)  

  

(Yes, the two, A1 and A2, are present on our national flag also :  

\- as the white band and the green band).

  

India will take some time to implement the message of Ananda Coomaraswamy

(when he heard India got political freedom): India, Be Yourself!
