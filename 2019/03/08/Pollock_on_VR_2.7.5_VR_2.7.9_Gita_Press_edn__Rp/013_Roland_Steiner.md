You force me to add a final word to this thread:  

  
\> the likes of Pollock and Goldman  
  

This ongoing disparaging tone and especially the underlying attitude  
of haughtiness is absolutely unbearable and unacceptable. Let there be  
no misunderstanding: I regard your frivolous chat with Rajiv Malhotra  
as malicious and clueless at the same time. I take it for granted that  
any work of a scholar has to face up to criticism (including, of  
course, the works of Prof. Goldman and Prof. Pollock). That is not the  
disputed point at all. Where we will disagree, however, is the answer  
to the question in what the character of true criticism consists.  
  
Goodbye,  
Roland Steiner
