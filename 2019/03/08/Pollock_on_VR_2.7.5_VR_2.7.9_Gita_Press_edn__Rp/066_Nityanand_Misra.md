**The chess player and the chess author**

  

The comparison of speakers of a language to birds and the scholars of the language who may not speak it to ornithologists is, prima facie, an expression of “othering”. The bird-human dichotomy reduces the speakers of a language to “specimens of a lower species” who are to be either studied by keeping them in aviaries and cages or to be preserved in their natural habitat by a “morally upright higher species”.

  

The comparison is also flawed: a bird can never become an ornithologist, and an ornithologist can never become a bird. There are no ornithologists who are also birds and there are no birds who are also ornithologists. Salim Ali need not fly or sing like a bird, but that is not all. He could not fly or sing like a bird even if he wanted. Similarly, it it not just the case that birds need not study other birds, they just cannot. In contrast, a speaker of a language who is not its scholar can become its scholar. Similarly, a scholar of a language who does not speak it can become its speaker. The effort needed is more in the former case than in the latter, but both transitions are possible.

  

Hence, I offer a different analogy: of the chess player and the chess author. Speakers of a language are like chess players and scholars of the language are like chess authors. There is a wide range of chess players: world champions, grandmasters, international masters, child prodigies, good players, average players, below-average players, beginners who can be checkmated in two or four moves (Fool’s mate and Scholar’s mate), etc. The range of chess authors is also wide. Some chess authors are simply chess historians who hardly know how to play chess, some are chess theorists who spend their lives on researching an aspect (opening, controlling the centre, endgame, etc), some are chess commentators, and some chess analysts. One does not need to get specialized chess education or write papers in peer-reviewed chess journals to be a champion chess player like Magnus Carlsen, but becoming the foremost chess author usually requires strong educational background and many publications. Importantly, the groups of chess players and chess authors are not disjoint sets, they do have overlaps: some chess authors are also good chess players and some chess players are also good chess authors.

  

There is no doubt that both chess players and chess authors add to our knowledge of chess, including both the theory of chess and the practical knowledge of playing a game of chess. There is a difference, however. A champion chess player, even one who has never written anything on chess, knows both theory and practice of chess. He/she may not write tomes on openings or gambits or endgames or advantages of castling or fianchettoing. He/she may not be able to express the theory very well even though he/she knows it and applies it in every game played. On the other hand, a celebrated chess author who is not a good chess player is good only on paper: he/she has little or no practical skill. By virtue of excelling at both theory and practice of chess, a champion chess player is a far superior “expert” of chess overall as compared to a celebrated chess author who does not have much great playing skills.

  

Consider the case of Antonio Radić, one of the top chess commentators in the world today who runs the hugely popular “agadmator” chess channel on YouTube with 386,000 subscribers. He is certainly a great chess teacher and millions (including my children and me) learn from his videos. Many a time he points out mistakes of grandmasters in games with a very sharp and incisive analysis (aided, obviously, by wonderful tools like the Sesse engine). He is also a good chess player with an Elo rating of 1898. Despite all this, he is far from being a match to any of the top chess players in the world which include thousands of Grandmasters (Elo 2500+), International Masters (Elo 2400+), FIDE Masters (Elo 2300+), and Candidate Masters (Elo 2200+).

  

Extending the analogy, if chess players are speakers of a language and chess authors scholars of a language, then a chess position is like a text in a language which is to be interpreted. Who would you trust more for the analysis of a chess position (old or new): a champion player or a celebrated author? In most cases, the evaluation of a champion player will be more reliable and accurate: the chess player is a better better “expert” of chess than the chess author. As an example, compare the evaluations by [Garry Kasparov](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMe-hvCwTRo) and [Antonio Radić](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMe-hvCwTRo) of the position after white played Nxh6 (move 26) in game 20 of the Kasparov versus Karpov World Championship Match at Lyon on 15 December 1990. Is there any question of who is better at reading the sixty-four squares?

  

When it comes to evaluating a chess position, the analysis of a champion chess player will in most cases be more reliable and accurate than that of a celebrated chess author. When it comes to translating or interpreting a text in Sanskrit, the translation or interpretation by a *pandit* will in most cases be more reliable and accurate than that by an Indologist. I respectfully submit once again, it is my experience which says that the Gita Press translations of the Ramayana are better than those by Goldman et al.

  

PS: An interesting recent read is [The Pseudoscience of Indology](https://swarajyamag.com/books/the-pseudoscience-of-indology-an-interview-with-joydeep-bagchee), an interview with an author whose work, published by none other than Oxford University Press, many Indologists love to hate.
