Namaste

  

This is an interesting thread, where both sides are crossing swords with no real intention in making swords meet ! That is called a stage/ staged
battle for entertainment.

Please permit me to present a slightly different perspective and seek the response from both sides.

  

1. Perspective on Language analysed by Paninian grammar and munitraya tradition : The indian schools / scholars of language while using / learning / using / interpreting Samskrutham in the frame of Panini- grammar regulation, do not bring in the interventions of historicity of language ( ruling out PIE model), Tower of Babel origination ( Shivasutra regulation/ model is not of Biblical kind), Social - historical- comparative linguistics model ( Samskrutham is always held distinct from Prakrut, desi, apabhramsha, mleccha models).

  

It does not matter if the Spiritual Divine origin of Samskrutham is not believed, relegated with a substituition tag of ‘ artificially crafted language’, a ‘ language with rules for artifiial word generation’. It does not give the ‘ academic’ freedom to interpret the given text ( like Ramayana, Gita) in a linguistically and culturally inappropriate way!

  

2\. Coming to script decoding , yes it is a great contribution by the scholar to have discovered how to read script of manuscript. Whatever is scripted and decoded needs a double corraboration from voice traditions as well as compliance with other language tools, especially grammar and ‘ nirukta/ kosha / paribhashaa’ technicalities!

  

We are seeing the devastating outcome of having ignored these cautions on Samskrutham ( as Vedanga paddhati for veda- bhashaa) in many threads on this forum.

  

3\. Within India, scripting of Samskrutham in many Indian scripts ( for reflecting the one same voice value) has not been sufficiently researched! Especially from indian frame of linguistics. For information, the Tamil language grammar (Dravidian??), up to 14th century had clean link with Paninian Sanskrit, continuing the tradition which began with Tolkappiyum. (Now this is almost dumped as ‘ grantha - scripting system). We have not even made complete connection with Tulu script which has a defined historic frame, and living tradition in Karnataka religious institutions. The tulu script / Tigalari -Malayalam nomenclature and standards debate is raging in technology- linguistic teams.

  

4\. Given the design limitation of scripting, and many indian languages with accent ( seara) adapted the devanagari scripting, the accent aspect never came to manuscriptong ( beyond the basic three markers/ some conventions in print typography). So much so a language like Newari ( from Nepal) can not be easily decoded for meaning unless some one culturally attined to the language reads and explains it.

So is the case with Tibetan script ( detived from Samskruth varnmaalaa) and used for accented buddhist chants. Same story with Jaina works in prakrit. How to adapt accent related to prakrut need to be derived from Pingala onwards , at leadt up to Kedarabhatta ( who deals with mudical rhythmic poetry in prakruth).

  

When indian Prakruth language studies, deviating from classical grammar guidelines ( of hemachandra) are dumped; when modern prakrith studies analyze classical prakruth on model of ‘ montessori english learning by kid- speech conversation model’, the source books do not ‘ reveal’ their ‘ inner essence’ (.  Patyeva ushase suvaasaah; na vivrunate tanoom swaam). Then do we write the academicians obituary on ‘ Subandhus Prakruth work ( vadavadatta) as ‘ dead prakruth in usage’?

  

In short, there is much to research before drawing swords at distance without a clarity on primary issues snd blame indian tradition scholars.
