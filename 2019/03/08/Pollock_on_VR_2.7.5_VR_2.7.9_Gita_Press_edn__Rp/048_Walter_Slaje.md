Dear Mr. Pillai,

  

this gives me an opportunity to point to an inquisitive mind from the 12^(th) century, Kalhaṇa, who wrote a history of Kashmir. Far from trustingly relying on earlier writers or on sacred lore, he made, as he says himself, an “effort in the present delineation of facts of the past towards rectifying in every respect what is erroneous“ (*tasmād asmin bhūtārthavarṇane । sarvaprakāraṃ skhalite yojanāya mamodyamaḥ *॥ RT I 10 ॥).

  

In his striving for historical facticity, he took great pains to ensure the reliability of his data by building on *reason as the primary source of his knowledge*, not on myths. He reports at some length on the sources consulted by him, their nature, accuracy, or inaccuracy, as the case may be, and on his troublesome efforts to rectify his predecessors’ errors by carefully checking their data against auxiliary source materials such as inscriptions and royal grants.

  

Since you aptly mention the ideal of *objectivity* - ­ as is well known, ideals are only rarely sufficiently achieved due to human weaknesses -­, an important point is that Kalhaṇa demanded *impartiality* from a writer of history:

“Disposing of \[this\] good quality \[mentioned earlier\], he alone deserves indeed praise, whose speech, **on giving an account of past matters, refrains from affection and dislike**, **as** \[**would** that\] of **an impartial** \[**person**\].” (*ślāghyaḥ sa eva guṇavān rāgadveṣabahiṣkṛtā । bhūtārthakathane yasya stheyasyeva sarasvatī *॥ RT I 7 ॥).



By his attitude and achievements, Kalhaṇa was clearly ahead of his time and he may indeed be seen as a forerunner of historical criticism, albeit without influence on, and also without recognition in, pre-modern India. All of his successors, Jonarāja, Śrīvara and Śuka were Kashmiris. Their historical reception, too, remained limited to the valley of Kashmir. Despite being a Mahākavi, Kalhaṇa received little attention from his fellow countrymen in the Indian plains until Aurel Stein brought his work to light by a monumental edition in 1892 (prepared from now lost manuscripts) and by an English translation in 1900. It was the edition of Stein which established Kalhaṇa’s fame also in India. Since Kalhaṇa was a seeker of historical truths, he presented the truths he had found about kingship in medieval India as impartially as he could. We know that the truth is not always beautiful, and more often than not it raises its ugly face also in Kalhaṇa’s history. This might be why he found little reception in the rest of India. It was all too real.
