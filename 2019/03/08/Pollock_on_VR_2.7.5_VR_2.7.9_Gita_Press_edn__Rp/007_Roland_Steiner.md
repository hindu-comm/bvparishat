\> It is not "intentional", it is pure ignorance.  
\> Cultural familiarity does not come by reading books!  
\>  
\> अर्थपरा is not in the dictionary. Look for अर्थ, get wealth,  
\> परा does not exist in dictionary either, so stretch by thinking "after",  
\> "After wealth" - make up "miserly!"  
\> It is juvenile. Massive boycott may help!

\> I do get irritated since our children are exposed to this nonsense!  
\> We have to speak loudly..  
  

A dictionary is not really required here, but:  
  
1. Vaman Shivaram Apte: The Practical Sanskrit-English Dictionary.  
Revised & Enlarged Edition. Poona 1957. s.v. arthapara (p. 226): "1  
intent on gaining wealth; greedy of wealth, covetous. 2 niggardly,  
parsimonious"  
  
2. -para (at the end of compounds): "Having anything as the highest  
object, absorbed or engrossed in, intent on, solely devoted to, wholly  
engaged or occupied in" (Apte, s.v. para, 12, p. 963).  
  
3. -parā is a feminine (referring to rāmamātā).
