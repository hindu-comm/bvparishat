In this particular instance, Dr. Roland Steiner is reading too much into the expression “the likes of”. From what I know, though “the likes of” is a typically negative expression, it is not always negative. The [Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English](https://www.ldoceonline.com/dictionary/the-likes-of-somebody-something)gives two meanings,“used to talk about someone you do not like or do not approve of” (negative) and “used to talk about people of a particular type” (neutral). What about the song“I like the likes of you”? [In the answers](https://ell.stackexchange.com/questions/43882/does-the-likes-of-usually-have-a-pejorative-connotation)to a question on Stack Exchange, I see the OED entry

  

*the like(s) of (rarely to): such a person or thing as; now **often** depreciatory. colloq.  
*

  

Again, it says often, not always. I may be corrected on the use of this expression. At least when I wrote “the likes of Pollock and Goldman”, I did not intend to use the expression in a pejorative sense. To clear the air, I am happy to rephrase my statement as

  

“It is probably okay for a person to make such a mistake on a mailing list, but what makes scholars like Pollock and Goldman write words like “has always been” in translation when it is not their in the original.”

Unbearable, frivolous, clueless, etc. is fine: that is your opinion. But unacceptable and malicious? Does not the word *unacceptable* display intolerance on your part and is not*malicious plain*ad hominem.

  

Thanks, Nityananda
