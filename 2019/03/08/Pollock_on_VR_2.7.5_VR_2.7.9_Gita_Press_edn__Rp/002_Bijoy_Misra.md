What i noticed is that the western scholars have difficulty with compound samasa words.

Pollock is confused with महीपति, because this may not be a dictionary word.

So they go मही and पति, and then get lost.  

During the colonial times possibly they took scholars in residence.

But I have not checked the old translations of the Vedic texts.

I know they get lost with Brahman and God etc. Those are mapping problems.

  

Unfortunately, the market is flooded with these and some of our people right here in BVP

read and ask peculiar questions!

  

As Sri Nityanand Misra pointed out, it is the rigor of expression that makes Valmiki stand out

among all poets. The possible long period of social observations and dramatics in india would

need exhaustive study. English does have words to distinguish the shades of mental conditions.  

Such analysis in india might predate Sanskrit and the Vedas.
