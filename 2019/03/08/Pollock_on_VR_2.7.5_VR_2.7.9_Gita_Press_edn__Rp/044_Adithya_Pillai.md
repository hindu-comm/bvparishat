Thank you for the response Nagaraj ji.

  

1\. Undoubtedly, new kinds of text based investigations were made possible with 'modernity'. For example, deciphering outdated scripts in a methodical way, trying to correlate texts to inscriptions, archaeological data, numismatic data, etc. was novel for the subcontinent. This sort of *data* gathering exercise was, as far as I am aware, unknown to/beyond the interests of traditional schools. This is in part because our institutions had other equally valid priorities.

  

However, this seeming 'objectivity' does seem to come with a worldview that implies that objectivity for its own sake using the evidence that is available is always possible, desirable and free of value judgments. With regards to ancient texts, in selecting the texts, in finding co-relations among the limited material, in highlighting a particular figure among others as important, in establishing consensus among the scholarly community, can we avoid the fact that some aspects of the tradition resonate with us and some don't?

  

I know that this objectivity seems to be an ideal we should hope for (like in the empirical sciences), but I wonder to what extent this objectivity seems *convincing* and relies on the community of scholars and past interpretations to agree upon. I'm sure this is not a new question, but it is always interesting to get insights from contemporary scholars who work with ancient texts.

  

2\. The method within traditionary schools, seems certainly different. As you mention personality of the Saastrakaara, the whole worldview which requires sensitivity, respect, integrity, etc. become prominent. The authority of the interpretation stems from the Saastrakara and the worldview in which he/she is embedded. This is not a objective worldview but, as you mention, it need not always be limited by orthodox tradition bound thinking. But can it avoid reinterpreting it's own traditionary thinking in the light of the facts established by the objective method?

  

This maybe too black and white and I'm sure there are strict limits to interpretation that depend on both community in both cases. Anyway, what is clear is that ad hominem attacks won't cut it.

  

Mishraji, I'm just an ordinary sepoy! :)
