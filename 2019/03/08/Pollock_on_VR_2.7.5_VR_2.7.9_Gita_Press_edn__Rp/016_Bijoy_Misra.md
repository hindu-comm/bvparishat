Dear Dr. Steiner,

  

I don't know your training or contributions. But I see that you seem to correlate a person's  

knowledge by the amount of time the person held a book. The culture is not studied by holding

or reading books. I have met scores of published authors who have spent their whole life in studying  

in India. But they have little idea of Indian people and her culture.
They make "opinions" and not

"scholarship". It is rampant! I myself have strange ideas of western culture, but I don't publish books  

on my thoughts. I am aware of my shallowness and lack of immersion.
The exuberance of the attempts

of writing commentaries through some forced thinking has bothered me as an ill-conceived human condition.

It is not clear why someone would study/do something that he or she does not fully respect.  

  

Let me ask you a simple question on what brought you to conduct India studies. For example, I got

into it to help educate my granddaughter while I discovered my ignorance. I am a trained Physicist.

I spent time in India studies as a choice of my immigrant life which I had not thought of when I first

moved from India. The trash literature on India was unknown to me. I only saw some media slant

in the newspapers in the '70s. You may answer in scholarly candor if you please. Please don't use  

adjectives to anyone directly or indirectly! Please feel to disagree without losing out to anger. Please  

feel free to point out my deficiencies in this post as any teacher would do!

  

Best regards,

  

Bijoy Misra
