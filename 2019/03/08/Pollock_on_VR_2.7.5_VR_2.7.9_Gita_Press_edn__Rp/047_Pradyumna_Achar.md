Respected Dr. Slaje,

  

I agree with you that language scholars are the best available people in deciphering the meaning of texts, but only in cases of those languages that are extinct and when there is no person left with a continuous lineage of that language. Otherwise, the conclusions drawn purely on the basis of analysis of written texts could be very misleading.

  

To illustrate this point, I took the first line of your message, and translated it into Sanskrit as follows:

संस्कृताभिवृद्धये असभ्यैः दत्तं यत् दानधनं तद्विषये मम मतिरस्ति । ते सर्वे एकायां पृथग्जाताः ; बलशालिनाः कृपणाश्च । तेषां उद्देश्यः कश्चन भाषायाः अध्ययनाध्यापनम् ।  

  

Of course there is no correlation between this so-called-translation and the meaning that you wanted to convey via your sentence. However, if, hypothetically, there was a person who doesn't know English well, and relied on a dictionary for translations, this would be rather convincing for him/her, because they would see the following in the dictionary:

  

"I think" (think =have a particular belief or idea)  
  
"the discussion about proficiency in Sanskrit proceeds" (proceeds=money obtained from an event or activity, could be charity)  
  
"from different fundamentals" (fundamental -- synonym -- rudimentary = relating to an immature, undeveloped, or basic form)  
  
"each based on different conceptions of what " (conception = "the action of conceiving a child", "what"="the thing or things that (used in specifying something)."  
  
"might" --- great and impressive power or strength  
  
"mean" -- "unwilling to give or share things, especially money; not generous"

  
Which is why I am of the opinion that for correct understanding of texts, we need to understand the nature and characteristics of the author,

the circumstancesand the context in which they are speaking, and also understand the audience that they are talking to. Of importance also

is the tone used, whether it was told humorously, in sarcasm or otherwise. We also need to know the style of speaking and the manner in which words

were being used at the time of composition. All this information is not codified in textual form; rather, it is passed down from those who heard the original author, from generation to generation. Therefore, shaastras should be understood from traditional teachers.

  

With regards

Pradyumna
