Namashkar Shri Nityanand ji,

  

Aapne atisookshamta se doshon ko darshaya hai.

I am also working as a translator for guru Rajiv Malhotra ji from past 10months. Even though I am not so famous n renouned like goldman or pollock.........I am far better than them in understanding the ABHIPRAYAH...😂.

  

PLZ keep exposing these people...Let Mr. Narayan Murthy know that what a fool he has made of himself by giving somany billion grants to pollock ....Mr. Murthy has a serious disease which is quite common in many Bhartiya and its called inferiority complex....😃

  

Pschologically these kind of people who try to misinterpret or demean the text, accoding to me, PERHAPS.....😊 have an mental illness called superiority complex. When such people find that there are things which they dont have then they are jealous and try to either claim superiority over it and if unsuccesfull they try to demean it......

It reminds me of kids story...recently I taught kids a dance based on Sanskrit story named.....

  

"Aamlanani Drakshaphalam".....😂

they are that fox who did not sweet grapes n hence started proving it to be sour....😂😂

  

Keep exposing...we all will circulate and orally educated people around us.

  

Dhanywaad.
