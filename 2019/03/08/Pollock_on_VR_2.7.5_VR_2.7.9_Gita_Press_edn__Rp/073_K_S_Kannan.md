'shivraj singh',

  

Please follow the thread carefully before complaining.

Somebody spoke of the hands that fed, but not the hands that jeopardised.

  

I am doing my bit, which you are not perhaps aware of.

Infinity Foundation India has produced four volumes under my editorship.

Each one has been announced on BVP as and when released;  

please go through those announcements at least.

They have even been gratis to all scholars on BVP who asked for it.

Please do not ask me to repeat the info.

  

Four more volumes are due, and are shortly to appear.

  

You are welcome to discuss with Rohan Murthy and his dad  

about whom I have not said anything.

  

Please read Kapil Kapoor, Arvind Sharma, and Coomaraswamy

who have answered most of the issues raised here.

  

Please do not get confused between rebuttal of a charge and a complaint.

  

(By the way, your usage of single inverted commas for your identity  

casts doubts whether it is your real name. Please be open.)
