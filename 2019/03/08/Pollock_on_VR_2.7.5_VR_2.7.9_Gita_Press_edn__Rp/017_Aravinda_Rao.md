Dear list-folk,

It is interesting to see the ongoing debate in this thread and in a related thread (on sailusha) between two groups - one attacking Rama and the other defending Rama. Both sides are acting as though they are talking merely at the academic level.

1\. The attackers are acting as though they are merely interpreting Ramayana, they have dedicated their life-time,etc., even while making indecent and hurting comments like 'misogynist pig' or 'pimp'. They are pretending to be quite academic.

The defenders are acting as though they are academically pointing out the defects in translations.

2\. The attackers are sufficiently intelligent to know that by calling Rama a pimp or a pig they are hurting the religious sentiments of hundreds of millions of people, including some of the BVP members. It is well within good manners.

The defenders are deeply pained inwardly but are acting as though they have risen above such prejudices and talking purely at academic level.

3\. The attackers are sufficiently intelligent to know that the literature being produced by them is lapped up by their LW stooges in India who are using it to hurt the religious feelings of people, to divide people and to denigrate a culture. These stooges manage to organize TV shows on local TVs, and use the same material. A few months ago there was a TV discussion (in Hyderabad) in which some ugly comments were made on Rama, on the same lines as the new criticism by the academics.This same material on Rama/Krishna is used by the local pastors for religious conversions.

I am sure the defenders are aware of such social consequences.

4\. Even earlier there have been such indecent comments (from people who know manners) calling Ganesha's trunk a limp phallus and outrageous remarks questioning the relation between Sita and Lakshmana, Sita and Hanuman.

The defenders are not talking about the deep hurt caused to them but the attackers are attributing bad manners and walking away with a sense of injured innocence.

5\. In one of the mails there was a reference to the American scholars and their contribution. We have to acknowledge that till about 1960s several US scholars were very friendly to Indian culture. In fact, some of them were called the Boston Brahmins. But may be, after the US became the world leader, it got some additional responsibilities relating to culture and probably new lobbies are at work behind the literary or sociological studies.

We do not know whether the attackers are simple academics or whether (like all researches in social sciences) they are the soldiers of some deeper lobby.

The Aesop's fable on tiger and the lamb has a lot of relevance to the defending team.
