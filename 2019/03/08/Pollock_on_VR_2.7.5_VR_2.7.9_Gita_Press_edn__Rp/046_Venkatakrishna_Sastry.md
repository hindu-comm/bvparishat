Namaste Misra ji

Should we go english dictionary route and linguistics?

Not necessarily, as long as each language is dealt on its own merit; which is not the case in this thread!

You are right: understanding is a practical art that sahrudayas excel more tha the dry academicians doing postmortem by lexicon.

Dear Dr Shastry,

I did think the direction you had in mind.

But should we go into English language linguistics in this group here?

We just have to make a blanket statement that the nuances of Sanskrit literature

do not permit the literal use of words.  

Also there are no "swords". "Literal" and "conceptual" are two different tracks in research.

"gravityof the words" is different than the "gravityof the earth"

What is said is the use of dictionaries in finding a meaning.  

Understanding is a practiced art and not obtained through the books - so is the message I see
