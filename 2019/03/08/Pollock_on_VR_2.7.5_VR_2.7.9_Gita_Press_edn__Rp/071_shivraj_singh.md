Kannan,  
We have to stop complaining. If something is broken why don't we fix it?  
  
We keep complaining about the West, Max Muller, William Jones, Rohan Murthy (it is his dad's money and they can do whatever they want to with the money), but we seldom produce scholarship which makes others take notice. The fact that Narayan Murthy did'nt find any Indian scholar to work on their foundation tells me they were not confident with Indian scholars.  
  
If we really want to turn the tide we have to produce in an organised way translation errors in sanskrit works, a history of India which references indigenous language works , etc etc.
