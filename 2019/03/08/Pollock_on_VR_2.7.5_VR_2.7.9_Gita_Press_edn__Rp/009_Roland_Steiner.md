\> Also, who is saying this statement? \*mantharA\*.  
  
You say it. As you will know, she is not well-disposed towards Rāma's mother.  

  
  
\> Even then, 'with what great purpose/motive' seems a better  
\> translation of the contextual meaning, than 'miser'.  
  

There is neither an equivalent to "what" nor to "great" in arthaparā.  
  
Mantharā asks the question why Rāma's mother is giving away riches to  
people (rāmamātā dhanaṃ kiṃ nu janebhyaḥ saṃprayacchati), being  
arthaparā (arthaparā satī). The commentator Govindarāja explains this  
passage as follows: arthaparā saty api "though (api) being arthaparā".  
The addition of api indicates a concessive sense here.  

  
  
\> Choosing miser seems to show awareness only of the dictionary, not  
\> of the nuances of the culture.  
  

It is not only the dictionary, but it is also the language use of the  
Rāmāyaṇa itself:  
  
2.16.46 nāham arthaparo devi lokam āvastum utsahe / viddhi mām ṛṣibhis  
tulyaṃ kevalaṃ dharmam āsthitam  
  
2.37.7: kevalārthaparāṃ hi tvāṃ tyaktadharmāṃ tyajāmy aham / agṛhṇāṃ  
yac ca te pāṇim agniṃ paryaṇayaṃ ca yat  
  
6.25.23: evaṃ sa mantrivṛddhaiś ca mātrā ca bahu bhāṣitaḥ / na tvām  
utsahate moktum artham arthaparo yathā  
  
  
As I said in another thread: As far as I am concerned, there is  
nothing more to say about that. I permit myself to withdraw from this  
thread.  
  
Best,  
Roland Steiner
