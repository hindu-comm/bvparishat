Dear Misra ji

  

I heard from Samskrita Bharati circles that when Pollock was taken to interact with children learning Sanskrit around Jaipur, and was asked to interact in Sanskrit, he could not do so fluently. I just searched if I could find any records, but I could not find it. I am sure it was alleged, but not sure if it is true. I remembered it because Pollock makes so many damaging remarks about Indian students and scholars; for instance, that there was not one person in Delhi that his student could reach out to read Sanskrit with (<https://indianexpress.com/article/express-sunday-eye/im-a-target-because-im-an-outsider-sanskrit-scholar-sheldon-pollock-5191995/>), and that a class of 80 MA students in Kerala could not understand Dasarupakam (<https://www.outlookindia.com/magazine/story/nobody-in-rome-will-mind-a-videshi-translating-aeneid/300228>). I wonder where this ranks in the Walter Slaje scale of measurement (pointing out pronunciation errors of one person = bad manners .... condemning an entire class of MA students = ? ..... condemning an entire city as having no knowledge of Sanskrit = ?  ... condemning an entire language, that too, the very language which provided one's livelihood = ?). I went through the academic system, including studying MA with a group of students, 80%+ of whom had little or no interest. Their problem was not lack of ability to understand (and Dasarupakam uses very simple language, except for certain technical terms), but interest. And, regarding the perceived non-availability of scholars in Sanskrit in Delhi, it just shows his arrogance and disdain. So, I sometimes wonder, whether this man who heaps such abuse with such disdain, could himself speak the language, and if yes, how well. Anyways, at the end of the day, all that reveals is only the personality and character of Pollock and is not central to the issue.
