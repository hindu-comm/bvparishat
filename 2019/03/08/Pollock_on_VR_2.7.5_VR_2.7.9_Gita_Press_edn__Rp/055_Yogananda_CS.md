This is one of the pain points in these kinds of dialogues, a patronising attitude, saying that Indians were made aware of their glorious heritage by Europeans. Please, this only shows that the rest of the world became aware of our heritage when critical editions / translations into their languages. I am reminded of a famous quote by Mark Twain:  

  

"When I was a boy of**fourteen**, my father was so ignorant I could hardly stand to have the old man around. But when I got to be twenty-one, I was astonished at how much he had learned in seven years."--**Mark Twain**.
