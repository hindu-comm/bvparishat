Dear Sri Aditya Pillai,

  

There are new developments in the studies on the questions of objectivity even in what you call empirical sciences (though in fact, all lakshya to lakshsNa study is empirical and inductive and what you might have in mind is natural sciences), in the wake of environmental crisis. Henryk Skolimowsky in his book, "Technology and Human Destiny" comes down heavily on the claims of objectivity in Natural Sciences on the basis of the anti-Indoc nature attitude that lead to the crisis.

  

Coming to your use of the word ' traditionary', probably in the sense of traditional in turn, in the sense of pre-modern Indian /Vedic, let me tell you that every discipline, modern or pre-modern develops into a tradition in course of time and all the later new claims of findings in the discipline are accepted or rejected as per the established traditions of the discipline only..

  

Coming to the objectivity in S'aastrakaara , I never get tired of quoting

  

risheeNaam days"Anam yacca na tat s"abda ibandhanam

  

Where he says that vaiyaakaraNa should not be overwhelmed by rishi's and should objectively observe the vyavahaara, usage by common people
