Agree, but is there any equivalent of “has always been”in *arthaparā*. It is probably okay for a person to make such a mistake on a mailing list, but what makes the likes of Pollock and Goldman write words like “has always been” in translation when it is not their in the original. I am sure Dr. Roland Steiner would know this but probably would not admit it now he has withdrawn from the discussion.

The word *arthapara*has the sense of one for whom *artha* is *para*. Compare with the word like*dharmapara*,*dharmapara*, *dānapara*, *śamapara*, etc. An *arthapara* person can probably be understood as a money-minded person. A money-minded person is not necessarily miserly (for which the word is *kṛpaṇa*). The*Vācaspatyam* says on*kṛpaṇa*:*adātari*(i.e., one who does not give).

  

The word *artha*has many meanings. Even if one takes money as the meaning here, since an*arthapara*person may or may not be*kṛpaṇa*, miserly is not a very good translation*.* We may want to see what Griffith and Hari Prasad Shastri have translated the word as.
