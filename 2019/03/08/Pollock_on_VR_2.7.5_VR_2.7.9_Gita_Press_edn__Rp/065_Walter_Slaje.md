"But, there is no word about the Bombay edition (by Durgaprasada & Peter Peterson) which was also published in 1892".

  

Really, is that so? Then I do apologise to the list and ask subserviently for your forgiveness. Have you, or have all the others, who are constantly busy with accusing western scholars of lecturing and controlling them, ever thought of the mere possibility of informing yourselves about basic Indological knowledge and have you tried to catch up to the current status of international Indological research by making at least *some* efforts of your own? By all appearances, that must be an almost invisible minority given the ignorance prevailing here openly. Conveniently asking around by tapping into the knowledge reservoir of others and at the same time heaping accusations upon them only because they are of non-Hindu stock is difficult to bear even for the well-intentioned. It amounts to nothing less than to biting the hands that feed one.

  

As already stated, I am busy also with other things. So this is the last answer to your question which I shall give in this hospitable Āryan environment:  

Durgāprasād's edition was made from a manuscript which Peter Peterson had obtained for him on loan from Mathura. This manuscript was no more than a copy of the original manuscript on which Stein's edition was founded. Durgāprasād had only this lone copy at his disposal, whereas Stein was lucky enough to having had access in Kashmir to the original exemplar containing scholarly notes in the margin as well as to other manuscriptal testimonies. That makes Stein's edition a *critical edition*, to which fact I had referred in my earlier post even by an exclamation mark, but quite obviously to no avail.

  

Have a nice day.
