Dear Dr. Rao,

I fail to see any relevance of your post to the thread. There are no "defenders"

or "attackers", There are "interpreters". Interpretation uses various tools,

some are advanced some are novice (depending on one's training).

Some people have spent years without being summoned in scholarship.  

It would be relevant if you may post any research on Valmiki or any personal

experience in interpreting poetic material.  

Best regards,

BM
