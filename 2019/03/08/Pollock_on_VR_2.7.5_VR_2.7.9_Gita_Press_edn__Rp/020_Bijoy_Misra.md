Dear Prof Paturi,

I am sorry not to have seen Dr Raos' Ramayana work. Politics of translation

would come if some one edits and presents the material with denigration. My

view is that the deficiency that Sri Nityanand pointed out lies in the translator's

ignorance. He showed the flaws in the translation. While Prof Pollock was

producing work for an American audience, he has an obligation to be accurate.  

Best regards,

BM
