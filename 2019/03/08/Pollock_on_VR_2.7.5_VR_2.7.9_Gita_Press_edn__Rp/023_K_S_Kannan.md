I need to make a few suggestive comments.

  

Mutual accusations of swadeshi-s and videshi-s that might have happened in this thread apart, it is not fair to paint with one brush all Western Indologists, and brand them as utterly incompetent.While not all of the Western Sanskritists can be said to be very careful scholars, most of them really *do hard work*, which many or most Sanskritists in our own country, the few that are, are apparently not quite doing.  

  

While Westerners in general study with zest almost all cultures/civilisations on earth, Indians are not even looking deeply into *their own* traditions with any comparable magnitude, finesse, rigour or zeal. This explains the rarity of Indians offering significant, consistent, and steady critiques of the enormous, eclectic, and energetic output of Western Indologists. It is this that makes the work of Nityananda Misra significant in our context.  

  

Misra has taken much trouble looking into the various translations of and commentaries on the *R*ā*m*ā*yaṇa*, the various traditional/modern lexica, and much relevant literature from the Vedic to modern writings, before presenting his case, and has paid attention to the subtleties of interpretation and nuances of meaning.

  

(However, I may add, not by way contradicting him but only complementing his good work, saying, ***nānapekṣitam** ucyate* of Mallinātha could be better, rendered as - "nothing extraneous/unwarranted would be brought in/stated" (rather than the somewhat bland "unexpected" for *anapekṣitam*); and *puruṣāntara-kovida* of Vālmīki may be interpreted anew, *or at least additionally*, as being an expert in plumbing into the interiors (***āntara*** = what pertains to ***antar***, the heart; their *iṅgita*, to wit) of men (i.e. *puruṣa + *ā*ntara* (rather than *puruṣa + antara*) though this way of splitting has not suggested itself to any commentator so far, traditional or modern as far as I know): Rāma could capture the \[unstated\] intent of people \[instantly\]).  

  

Misra's take on the blind influence of the Grosses Petersburger Dictionary on Monier Williams' was indeed brilliant. Misra has shed light on the ugly face of Western Indologists, who know very well what hurts Hindu ethos and sentiments the most (viz. their perverse sexual innuendos in respect of Hanumān or Lakṣmaṇa, leave alone Sītā or Rāma, or others). And that is exactly the reason they love to dwell on the same as many times as possible and in as detailed a way as possible, and in as varied ways as possible and in as offensive a manner as possible - even though there is not an iota of truth therein (and which they are too acutely aware of). (By the same token, yet, even if facts proved positive, Misra is too dignified to hint at whether even Goldman, Pollock, and Truschke and Wendy would be aligned as *śailūṣa*-s and *śailūṣī*-s of their own interpretation - in these days of queer confessions. Sadism is a given, after all, of the Whites broadly - as their erstwhile treatment of Native Americans and many others bears out amply). One must indeed make a statistic out of the elusive and delusive use of "*perhaps*", so abundantly and significantly and deceptively deployed by Pollock. A student of poetics, Pollock is a past-master of equivocation and prevarication, and dark and stark "implicatures".  

  

My own student Manjushree Hegde has also exposed the multiple sloppy/mischievous translations of Sheldon Pollock in her little monograph (134 pp.) entitled *Reclaiming Ramayana* (Pub: 2018, Infinity Foundation India). Manjushree also has exposed the decisive blows of Pollockian "perhaps"-es.  

  

While one can certainly appreciate the various references provided by Roland Steiner on the use of *arthaparā* (all pertinent citations), or the good work of Slaje done elsewhere (as pointed out by Vishal Agarwal), or the caution that David and Nancy Reigle evidence in hinting at some of the not-so-careful renderings by even Indians (Debroy, for example, though based on the Critical Edition of the *Mahābhārata*), (and notwithstanding some witless remarks offered by some of the effusive but not quite apposite contributors to the Parishat in the thread), the fact cannot be denied that the concerned Western Indologists do not, as a clout, deign to accept their errors, venial or mortal, but prefer to feign ignorance, in their general superciliousness, of all criticism of their ideas, and of course evince readiness to pounce via their proxies upon just the weakest critic on the other side of the fence.  

  

They all act as a cabal, and attempt to defend each other of their own clique, and generally deride and speak spitefully of Indian scholars (Did not Roth seek to wrest the right of Vedic interpretation from Yāska himself? etc.; their self-contained Mutual Admiration Society is staggeringly well-organised) - which all is what is triggering and enthusing Indic institutions to become censorious in respect of them at the outset. It is a comedy, had it not also been a tragedy, that Truschke thinks, for example, that she is hated precisely because of her *scholarship*!  

  

Infinity Foundation India has brought out four volumes showcasing the typical inhibitions and limitations of Pollock and his ilk, but there is little by way of any semblance of response to be expected from their quarters - even for serious criticism.

  

Uncompromising scholars like Dr. Ananda Coomaraswamy in US and Dr. Ramshankar Bhattacharya in India have always called a spade a spade, and never hesitated to expose the flaws in understanding by Western (and even Eastern) writers on Indological themes. Both had made a deep and detailed study of the East as well as the West, and their writings betray clarity as well as force, and substance as well as style.  

  

*All this goes to show the enormity and urgency of the task Indian Indologists need to assay*, and the depth and dignity demanded thereof. It is high time, then, that Sanskrit scholars began a new series of **dissertations** - taking up **for their PhD**, for example, **the egregious errors of Western Indologists**, one by one, or field by field (and, of course, those of their Indian "heirs" and sepoys, no small in number themselves, who all have had their heyday till the present, thanks to the dispensation at the Centre that danced but to Western tunes: So much so that "When it rained in Moscow, Nehru would hold his umbrella in Delhi" (as it was well said characterising the Nehruvian Era); and again, "When they were asked to bend, they chose to crawl" (said of our "intellectuals" during the "glorious" Emergency Epoch ushered in by his daughter).

  

Westerners do what they do because they cannot be otherwise. The White Man's Burden knows no end - in respect of space or time - even after Laying Kipling's Ghost (by Coomaraswamy). Will not "the heathen in his blindness" need their "service" ever and anon? Overt expansionism, or pervert imperialism, or covert colonialism (or all these in various combinations) - these are the only choices, after all, that they can think of: Growth for the sake of growth is the cult of cancer.  

  

Rather than blaming them that they attack us, the mild and the harmless, we must strengthen ourselves - **intellectually and spiritually** essentially (and as a bulwark against our "fair" foes, militarily and economically) : ***idam brāhmam idam kṣātram*** !! ( After all, dis-ease (leading to early de-cease) seldom befalls those whose immunity is strong).

  

Let them do their work, and we ours.
