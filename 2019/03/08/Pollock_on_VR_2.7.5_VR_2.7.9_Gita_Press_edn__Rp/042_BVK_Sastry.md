Namaste Misra ji



On \< ... thrust in this post. You mention the word "clarity" in the last sentence. Can you please state the **relevance of the post** to the thread in one sentence (for clarity)? >



***One line***: Both debating sides seem to sideline the importance of ' clarifying their position' on ***How to teach " Samskrutham* " to attain the 'Speaking fluency / effort needed to
compose and appreciate Valmiki's poetry ( = Sahrudayataa) '** and acquire ' Linguistic Scholarship standards of Samskrutham, set as 'Vedanga Vyakarana', regulated by Munitraya tradition.



 That is the real Language Appropriate way to study and translate the source text.



The relevance of my post to the thread of discussion is : \< Pollock's alleged inability to speak fluently in Sanskrit? .. I wonder where this ranks in the **Walter Slaje scale of measurement (pointing out pronunciation errors of one person = bad manners .... condemning an entire class of MA students = ? ..... condemning an entire city as having no knowledge of Sanskrit = ?  ... condemning an entire language, that too, the very language** which provided one's livelihood = ?). 



***Note:***



a) This **Language appropriateness** ( Vak-Artha Samprktataa/ Yuktataa : Kalidasa) was well articulated in some earlier thread by Prof. Korada , explaining 'artha- nirvcahana' using the factors of Prakrana, Linga, kosha, vyavahara etc.



b) Classical Position: Samskrutham is a language where every term needs to pass the test set by 'Munitraya regulated' rules ( 700 BVE- 200 BCE) set in 'Vedanga Vyakarana'.



 When these rules are stretched back to a work of 6000 BCE , and coming to us through a 2000 years of interpretation layers of philosophy, culture and practices, one needs to critically think on the challenging issue of 'Language- Grammar - continuity without any social usage intervention and deterioration '. Western academicians are asking the logical issue of such a 'Stable language' coming up to Panini as a voice tradition and coming to us as ' manuscript tradition'. Indian teams are faith-foundation arguing with the axiomatic premise that ' available manuscript is a precise a transcript of the ancient poet'. This precisely is the point where ' faith' and 'disbelief' are crossing their swords, without touching the very critical issue: What made Sanskrit to have the kind of stability it has shown to be present between Valmiki and Panini ? What Valmiki meant by a given expression could become any ones guess when the source text is moved away from the ' language appropriate frame work and its culture'.



c) *An exercise to understand what would be Language Appropriateness*: Here below, I place a list of English words which come under the ambit of ' inappropriate' ( used by me in the sense of ' ***asaadhu***').



 Can some one start finding the Samskruth equivalents for all these shades of the term, and list to show how they look like? How many can we create as matching from English to Sanskrit ? without technical challenges coming up ?



*Synonyms of ' inappropriate' - Words- phrases Related to inappropriate* : amiss, graceless, improper, inapposite, inapt, incongruous, incorrect, indecorous, inept, infelicitous, malapropos, perverse, unapt, unbecoming, unfit, unhappy, unseemly, unsuitable, untoward, wrong, inopportune, unfortunate, unseasonable, untimely, extraneous, immaterial, inapplicable, irrelative, irrelevant, misbecoming, mismatched, incompatible, inconsistent, uncongenial, bad, naughty, sinful, blamable, blameworthy, censurable, banned, barred, disallowed, forbidden, interdicted, outlawed, prohibited, proscribed, awkward, gauche, ungraceful, unacceptable, unsatisfactory, out of place, out of the way,



*Near Antonyms of inappropriate*: fortunate, opportune, seasonable, timely, applicable, apposite, apropos, apt, germane, material, pat, pointed, relative, relevant, compatible, congenial, harmonious, allowed, authorized, permitted, approved, endorsed (also indorsed), kosher, licensed, sanctioned, abetted, encouraged, promoted, supported, acceptable, adequate, all right, decent, fine, OK (or okay), passable, respectable, satisfactory, tolerable, commendable, creditable, exemplary, blameless, irreproachable, balanced, companionate, congruous, consonant, harmonious
