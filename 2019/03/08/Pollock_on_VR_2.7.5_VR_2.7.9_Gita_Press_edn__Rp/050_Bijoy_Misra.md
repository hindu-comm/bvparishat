Dear Dr. Slaje,

Again you are on a tangent! Unlike the Christian or Jewish religious writings, there is no

history in Ramayana. Old legends might have existed, Ramayana is a poetic text. Valmiki

is a poet, not commissioned by anyone. The whole premise that you are operating is  

unfortunately made up by you, it has nothing to do with Indian culture, poetics or the nuanced

meanings of words.  

While I recognize your academic reading, I don't get your audience. I have seen many like  

you who wish to teach Indian culture to the native people under some pretext. The British  

did that once upon a time through torture, I don't get this new method.
Can the Indian culture

be respected as it it stands with her billion people? I assume you understand the sentiment.

I don't want to discourage you, but am requesting you to kindly dive deeper if you can. We  

are not analyzing a tree, we are analyzing a living civilization! It is not a fossil, it breathes!

Just puzzled by your continued assertion of teaching methods! Do meet one of the scholars

in this list in person in your next visit to India and have a free discussion. Please don't assume!  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
