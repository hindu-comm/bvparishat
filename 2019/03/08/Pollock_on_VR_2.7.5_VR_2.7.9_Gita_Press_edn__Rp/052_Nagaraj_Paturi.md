Dear Prof. Misra,

  

Dr Slaje is not saying that Ramayana contains history in it. Nor is he saying that searching for historical facts in Ramayana is the best method of studying the book.

  

He is saying that 'the best way of studying any book like Ramayana is to look into the historical circumstances under which the text was composed and which part of the content of the text is resulting from which historical conditions of the text. We Western Indologists are following that method. For this to be done, you need to follow the method of history. That kind of approach , though very rarely existed in ancient India, in books like Kashmira Raja Tarangini. But Indians could not appreciate such books because they were always looking for beautiful things not truths which may not always be beautiful. Remember, even this book which has the greatness of the approach of the western Indologists was brought into light by one of us, the western Indologists only. You are not able to appreciate our approach to your texts just as you could not appreciate Kalhana's book. You may not know what Historical Criticism of a text that I am struggling to explain to you is. Please visit the web page to learn what it is'.

  

This is what he was telling Sri Aditya and through him to the list.

  

The word Criticism in Historical Criticism comes from the term/ concept Literary Criticism and Historical Criticism is in fact Historical Literary Criticism and that is only one of many methods of approaches to Literary Criticism. Most of [those.in](http://those.in) the list like me who studied PG courses in Literature in universities learnt about this during our bacca days and have hands on experience of doing it for many Indian literary texts as we have been practising literary critics.

  

But the fact is that Historical Literary Criticism is only one of numerous approaches to Literary Criticism and one of the outmoded approaches in that field.

  

Later schools in it like New Criticism and schools in it even later like post-structural , post-modern etc. relegated it into the past as one of the old methods.

  

'History' the discipline/method that is the backbone of Historical Criticism itself is under heavy interrogation today. Way back, Prof. Mircea Eliade discussed how 'history' is only one of the different ways of looking at the past. People are replacing the notion of THE history with multiple histories.

  

India has a long tradition of S'aastreeya/rigorously methodological study of literary texts without any recourse to history .

  

No great nation or civilization in the world stopped progressing before 'history' was introduced to them. Even today all human progress or welfare is essentially dependent on the discipline of history . History itself is struggling to acceptance as 'science' among various University disciplines

  

Ancient Indian adhyayanas progressed vibrantly without textual criticism etc.
