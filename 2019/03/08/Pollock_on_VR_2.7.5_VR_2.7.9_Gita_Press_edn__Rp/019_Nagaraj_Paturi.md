Dear Prof. Bijoy Misra,

  

You might do well to watch the videos of Dr Aravinda Rao on Ramayana to know his efforts in that area.

  

There definitely are two sides among the interpreters, though the topic of translation errors does not have to do with any 'defending' the 'deities' from the 'attackers' and attackers and defenders may not be the best choice of words. Incidentally those who have been insensitive to the culture insiders in their interpretation are the same ones whose translation errors are being brought to light. Errors in translation being pointed out are not being argued on the basis of cultural insensitivity. But cultural insensitivity is certainly a potential source of translation errors. The translation of words such as arthapara, s'ailusha etc. are good examples. It is well established that literary translations are cultural translations too and translators not sensitive to the culture of the source texts are bound to err in their translation work.

  

'Politics of translation ' is another area gaining greater focus nowadays. Dr Rao seems to be suspecting some conscious politics of translation at play behind the culturally insensitive translations.

  

  

Sri Nityanand-ji seems to be focussed more on the etymological and interpretative flaws rather than on the cultural insensitivities.
