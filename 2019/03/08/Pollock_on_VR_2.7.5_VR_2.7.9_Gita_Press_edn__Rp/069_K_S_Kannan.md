The issue is not one of making accusations.

  

The West cannot escape introspecting - as to who in the first place destroyed the native system of education in India, and why?  

Who made it impossible to eke out even the utterly simple living that Sanskrit scholars needed or were used to?

  

All that Westerners wanted was to destroy this vast continuous tradition at its source,

and they cherished the dream that it must be so devastated that Hindus will one day have to sit and learn it at their feet.

  

What were the dreams of Max Muller and Monier Williams? : nothing but to Christianise India -

MM & Co., and their successors, were verily the hands that feed? :  

Yes, feed nothing but poison. Aim at sabotaging a living tradition  

in order to reduce it to one of nothing more than museum value.

  

Hindus never begged the West to "save" their tradition.  

Do you expect Pollock and Wendy and Jeffrey Kripal and Courtright  

are out to "save" the Hindu tradition!  

  

Hindus had secured their tradition for thousands of years.

  

Why are European/American governments spending money on studying Sanskrit texts if they know they are worthless?

Why do they want at all Yoga and Ayurveda? Why is Yoga a multi-billion dollar business in US and elsewhere?:

Steal all Indian knowlege, repack, and sell it back? And cry hoarse about Intellectual Property Rights?

Hypocrites and saboteurs of the highest order!! You have the nerve to claim to serve our tradition by patenting our time-honoured neem and turmeric etc.!  

  

If Yoga is saving lives in US, who is feeding whom, Sir?

  

Answer if you have conscience.

  

All that the West wants is to dominate the rest of the world.

The dictionaries and concordances that are prepared, manuscripts and works of art stolen and saved  

are only tools for more sophisticated exploitation.

They can of course be show-cased as great service rendered.

  

Ask questions about ultimate goals, not incidental by-products.

Amidst the plethora of weeds, a good plant or two may indeed grow.  

  

Coomaraswamy pointed out long ago that mere mastery of lexica and grammar,  

that the West so well excels in, in no wise proves sufficient to interpret.

The endeavour is not admired by the wonderful tools developed and pressed into service,

but by adjudging towards what end they were utilised.  

  

Westerners have their own, polished, version of *al-taquiyya*.
