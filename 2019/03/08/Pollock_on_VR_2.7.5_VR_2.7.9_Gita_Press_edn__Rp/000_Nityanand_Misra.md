Dear list members

  

A Twitter user (@Bhaktirassagar) pointed out another example of schoolboy errors in Sheldon Pollock's translation of the Ayodhyakanda of Valmiki Ramayana. The half-verse is

  

*2.007.005e kārayiṣyati kiṃ vāpi saṃprahṛṣṭo mahīpatiḥ*  

  

Pollock translates

  

*Has something happened to delight the lord of the earth? What is he planning to do?*

  

1\) One question becomes two questions

2\) There is no sense of*Has something happened to delight* in the original verse at all!!

3\) *What will he get done* (*kārayiṣyati kiṃ*) becomes*What is he planning to do*. Causative (*ṇijanta*) is ignored: who on earth translates *kārayiṣyati* as what is he planning to do?

  

Refer the attached images for the Hindi translation by Gita Press, the three Sanskrit commentaries, Sheldon Pollock's translation. As usual, Gita Press Hindi translation is accurate.

  

Look forward to your comments.

  

Thanks, Nityānanda
