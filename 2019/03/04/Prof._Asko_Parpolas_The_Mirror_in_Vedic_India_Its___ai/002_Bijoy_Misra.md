But fundamentally आदर्श would mean more like "look alike".

"look alike" would have little to do with a "mirror".

"look alike" as pattern matching could be an innate  

human sensory function. it is built in, not developed.

I had mentioned about digitization before. Digitization

is a process of pattern matching, finding objects that "look alike".

  

Development of ideas through pattern matching is an excellent

undertaking. Why is "water" different than "air".  

We also need to think of words like सदृश and समदृश

  

A sentence like "I am seeing me in you" is a valid

yogic statement. But then using आदर्श as a physical

mirror is an entirely different concept.
