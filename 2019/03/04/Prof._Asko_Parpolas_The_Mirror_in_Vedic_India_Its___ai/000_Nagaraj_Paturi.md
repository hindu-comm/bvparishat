Namaste

While on the topic of Sanskrit- Terms', I may draw the attention of the scholars to a recent publication from Akso Parpola,Professor emeritus of Indology

University of Helsinki. The title of the paper -'The Mirror in Vedic India: Its ancient use and its present relevance in dating texts'published in: Studia Orientalia Electronica vol. 7 (2019): 1-29. A pdf is downloadable at<https://journal.fi/store/issue/view/5490>.Here is the abstract:



The major first part of the paper collects as exhaustively as possible all mentions of words for ‘mirror’ occuring in Vedic literature (*c.*1200–300bce). The occurrences are presented with sufficient context in Sanskrit and English in order to show how and why the mirror was used in Vedic rituals and Vedic culture in general, and what meaning was ascribed to it. The second part of the paper discusses a fact of major significance that emerges from this documentation: in the extensive older Vedic literature of the Saṃhitās, Brāhmaṇas, Āraṇyakas and Śrautasūtras (excepting the late Kātyāyana-Śrautasūtra), there is no reference to the mirror at all. This suggests that the mirror was not known in Vedic India until it was introduced to South Asia by the Persian Empire at the end of the sixth centurybce. The later Vedic literature, starting with the early Upaniṣads and comprising also the Gṛhyasūtras and Kātyāyana-Śrautasūtra, would therefore postdate 500bce. In other words, the ‘mirror’ words seem to offer a criterion that for the first time enables a division of the Vedic literature into two clearly separate phases of development. Equally important is the firm historical basis that the mirror provides for dating the transition point.

  

The focus is on the term ' aa-darsha, used in the reference Vedic text. The in-house traditional schools perspective,on the term ' aa-darsha ( आ-दर्श) is not limited to its interpretation as ' mirror' based on lexicon. It could / would mean ' From and including the full moon day' ( eg: as in दर्श-पूर्ण्माआसाभ्यां यजेत). From this perspective, the open review of Akso Parpola's paper by scholars is invited. . This could help address one more challenging issue on dates of Vedic resources.

Dr B V K Sastry avare,

  

Thanks for bringing this very important article from a very important scholar into discussion..

  

But I wish you started a separate thread for this.

  

I know that this article could involve some problems of translation too.

  

But its focus is more on the occurrence of a word or words for a tool called mirror. Its objective is to establish a later date for the early Upanishads.

  

I am starting a new thread on this.
