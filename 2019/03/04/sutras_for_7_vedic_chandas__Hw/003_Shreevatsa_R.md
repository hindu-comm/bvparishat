The nameअनुष्टुप् / anuṣṭubh is used ambiguously in two or three different senses, which leads to a certain confusion.

  

Let me share what I understand, so that I can be corrected if I am confused about the exact nature of the confusion. :)

  

1\. When used as a Vedic chandas (along with Gayatri, Triṣṭubh, etc), "anuṣṭubh" simply means 4 pādas of 8 syllables each. This can be represented as 4 lines of "xxxxxxxx" where each "x" stands for either L (laghu) or G (guru).

All the other of the 7 Vedic metres that you asked about can be defined similarly simply by counting; there are no more elaborate rules as far as I know. E.g. (dropping the diacritics) Gayatri = 8+8+8 syllables,Ushnik =8+8+12 syllables, Anushtubh = 8+8+8+8 syllables,Brihati =8+8+12+8 syllables,Pankti = 8+8+8+8+8 syllables,Tristubh = 11+11+11+11 syllables, Jagati = 12+12+12+12 syllables.

  

1'. By extension, in classical Sanskrit poetry, the name "anuṣṭubh" is by some authorstreated as a \*class\* of all the (more specific) metres that contain 32 syllables in total. For example, according to this classification it would include metres like Pramāṇikā (4 lines of LGLGLGLG) orVidyunmālā (4 lines of GGGGGGGG), and it would also include the popular śloka metre (see below). The rest of the 7 names are also similarly used as classes with the corresponding number of total syllables, e.g. Jagati is used as a class containing very different specific metres like Toṭaka (4 lines of LLGLLGLLGLLG) or Vaṃśastha (4 lines of LGLGGLLGLGLG); Gayatri is used as a class containing 24-syllabled metres like Śaśivadanā (4 lines of LLLLGG -- note this is not at all like the Vedic metre of 8+8+8), etc.  

  

2\. Colloquially, "anuṣṭubh"is used for a specific (and most popular) metre in classical Sanskrit poetry, one known technically as the śloka metre. The rules given in the question and answer so far concern this metre, which is more constrained than the Vedic metre. They both amount to saying that the metre has two halfs of "xxxxLGGx" (odd pāda) followed by "xxxxLGLx" (even pāda), and this is not a full characterization of the metre either, though it accounts for common cases. (To further add to the confusion, the word śloka itself is also used colloquially in a very broad sense and can often refer to any verse in any metre.)

  

Hope this helps,
