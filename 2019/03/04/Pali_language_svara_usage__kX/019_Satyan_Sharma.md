Thanks to Ramakrishnan ji and Madhav ji for such informative discussion. As I had mentioned earlier, ‘sara’ here may also refer to sentence stress. Putting stress on the wrong words in a sentence may misrepresent the

meaning of it. In that sense, the Buddha’s appreciation might equally apply to the use of sentence stress correctly.
